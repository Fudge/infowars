[00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:14.380]  It's Wednesday, March 13th, 2019.
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.524]  This is the Alex Jones Show from the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:22.345]  I'm Owen Schroer filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:26.167]  We will be hearing from Alex Jones in the bottom of the first hour.
[00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:34.012]  And then in the second hour, Alex has a big message for President Trump.
[00:00:36.363 --> 00:00:53.838]  And we need you to share the links today, tell your friends and family, and then take these banned segments, take the banned Alex Jones segments from today's Alex Jones Show, and re-upload them to your own YouTube channel.
[00:00:53.838 --> 00:01:03.646]  Now, I have to say, I kind of feel like a jerk for asking you to do that, because in the current environment now, that gets you banned.
[00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.082]  But hey, this is the InfoWar.
[00:01:08.082 --> 00:01:15.589]  Now, I've got all kinds of news that I really need to be focused and get to today.
[00:01:15.589 --> 00:01:28.160]  And it's amazing all the developments that you have right now going on with the Lisa Page testimony being released.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.922]  You've got Andrew McCabe
[00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:33.848]  Being referred to for a criminal investigation.
[00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:36.389]  That's been going on for a while.
[00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:45.911]  Tom Fitton has just sued to get Rod Rosenstein's communications in the 10 days leading up to the Robert Mueller appointment.
[00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:55.452]  That could be the bombshell that blows the entire levy and floods the swamp.
[00:01:55.452 --> 00:01:59.293]  As if we didn't have enough physical evidence
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:16.470]  That acting members of the FBI, the DOJ, and even the White House were engaged in this whole fake Russian collusion investigation from the get-go, that would pretty much seal the deal.
[00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.675]  And then you have Adam Schiff, who's trying to keep it all classified.
[00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:25.536]  So that's one side of
[00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:33.173]  Criminal behavior being investigated right now amongst the Democrats.
[00:02:33.173 --> 00:02:37.195]  But how about the Collegegate scandal?
[00:02:37.195 --> 00:02:37.976]  Oh my gosh!
[00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:41.135]  I'm so shocked!
[00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:49.900]  You're telling me that a bunch of Hillary Clinton voters were using their money and power and influence to cheat the system?
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.341]  Oh no!
[00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:53.883]  I had no idea it was going on!
[00:02:53.883 --> 00:02:56.004]  I'm so surprised!
[00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:58.145]  Oh, you mean Hollywood?
[00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:02.508]  That lectures us all day long on how to fight for the oppressed?
[00:03:02.508 --> 00:03:07.991]  Was using its money and power to cheat the system?
[00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:08.852]  Oh my gosh!
[00:03:10.126 --> 00:03:13.469]  It's shocking, folks!
[00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:14.289]  Oh, wait!
[00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:20.834]  You're telling me that people who had close relationships with the Obamas were also involved?
[00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:21.655]  Oh, no!
[00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:25.538]  Friends of the Obamas were also cheating the system the whole time?
[00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:26.919]  Oh, no!
[00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.000]  Oh, it's a travesty!
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.322]  America never saw it coming!
[00:03:30.322 --> 00:03:30.942]  Oh, my gosh!
[00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:33.244]  We never knew Hollywood was a bunch of lying scum!
[00:03:33.724 --> 00:03:37.246]  Oh my gosh, we never knew Hillary Clinton voters were a bunch of frauds!
[00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:41.648]  Oh my gosh, we never knew the Obamas were hanging out with cheaters and liars and scandalous people!
[00:03:41.648 --> 00:03:42.509]  Wow!
[00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:43.989]  It's finally all coming out, folks!
[00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.250]  We had no idea!
[00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.731]  Nobody could have ever told you!
[00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:48.312]  InfoWars has never reported it!
[00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:49.312]  Alex Jones has never reported it!
[00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.774]  He never even exists!
[00:03:51.774 --> 00:03:57.777]  And I was sitting, looking at all the news coming out, and I was like, wow!
[00:03:57.777 --> 00:04:00.038]  InfoWars is next year's news today!
[00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:12.815]  And so then Alan Dershowitz comes out and says that the College Gate scandal that's being surfaced right now is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:18.617]  And then when you read into the weeds of the story, folks, you see how far they're willing to go in their deception.
[00:04:18.617 --> 00:04:24.100]  Photoshopping pictures, faking injuries, I mean, like,
[00:04:26.144 --> 00:04:28.485]  Next level con games.
[00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:34.707]  And just to get their kids into college, what happened to the good old days when you bought a new rec center?
[00:04:34.707 --> 00:04:36.247]  I mean, that's how it used to be done.
[00:04:36.247 --> 00:04:40.669]  Hey, yeah, sure, my kid just kind of skipped the system, but guess what?
[00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.290]  The rest of the students get to enjoy this brand new rec center.
[00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.750]  Guess what?
[00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.212]  The rest of the students get to enjoy this brown new hall, this brand new library, this brand new computer lab.
[00:04:49.212 --> 00:04:50.112]  No, they don't even do that!
[00:04:51.243 --> 00:04:55.027]  That's because it's not about anybody benefiting except them.
[00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:55.708]  That's what it's all about.
[00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:57.590]  It's all about their selfish own egos.
[00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.742]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[00:05:03.742 --> 00:05:06.744]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[00:05:06.744 --> 00:05:13.610]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.771]  X2 is back.
[00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:15.551]  We got it.
[00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:17.233]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:18.814]  We rushed it into production.
[00:05:18.814 --> 00:05:19.594]  It's been bottled.
[00:05:19.594 --> 00:05:21.276]  The labels are being put on today.
[00:05:21.596 --> 00:05:26.898]  And that it's going to be on an 18-wheeler, right here to Austin, from the plant in the Rockies.
[00:05:26.898 --> 00:05:28.679]  And it's going to be shipped out to you.
[00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:30.100]  Be sure to sign up for AutoShip.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.000]  Get an additional 10% off.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.622]  The 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[00:05:36.622 --> 00:05:38.543]  Research the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:05:38.543 --> 00:05:40.324]  Find out why it's so important.
[00:05:40.324 --> 00:05:42.145]  Find out what the globalists don't want you to have.
[00:05:42.685 --> 00:05:45.686]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:16.092 --> 00:06:21.196]  But we will be hearing from Alex Jones in the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:21.196 --> 00:06:32.385]  And then in the second hour, Alex Jones has an emergency message for President Trump that you're not going to want to miss.
[00:06:32.385 --> 00:06:34.427]  We need you to spread the links.
[00:06:35.683 --> 00:06:47.495]  To this show, go to infowars.com slash show, click on the Alex Jones Show link, download those video segments, and then re-upload them to YouTube so that we can get the message out.
[00:06:47.495 --> 00:06:50.618]  We have to beat this censorship.
[00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:56.944]  And we need the President to have our back in this battle for free speech in America.
[00:06:59.045 --> 00:07:05.470]  So, do not miss Alex Jones' emergency message to President Trump coming up in the second hour.
[00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.072]  Kaitlin Bennett joins me in the third hour.
[00:07:08.072 --> 00:07:11.635]  She got kicked out of a mall for being harassed.
[00:07:11.635 --> 00:07:13.516]  Literally.
[00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:23.704]  Now, it's amazing Alex Jones is miles away and yet we are on the exact same wavelength.
[00:07:23.704 --> 00:07:27.707]  I didn't talk to Alex this morning when I was prepping for the show, but
[00:07:29.056 --> 00:07:35.603]  He was talking to the crew and the producers and we have some segments coming up he's going to be on.
[00:07:35.603 --> 00:07:40.588]  But we were both on the same page and that's why I'm wearing this t-shirt today.
[00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:48.896]  This is the t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com and it has the InfoWars logo.
[00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:50.798]  It's the Tiananmen Square Tankman.
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:08:01.507]  With the Facebook logo, the Apple logo, the YouTube logo, the Spotify logo, all as the tanks getting ready to try and run over InfoWars.
[00:08:01.507 --> 00:08:11.334]  And I didn't even think about this, but if you take my opening segment from yesterday, it pretty much describes this t-shirt right here.
[00:08:11.334 --> 00:08:13.356]  We will not be moved.
[00:08:13.356 --> 00:08:15.857]  We stand as a rock against tyranny.
[00:08:15.857 --> 00:08:16.278]  So yeah.
[00:08:17.577 --> 00:08:27.942]  So, if President Trump says, well, just behave yourself on social media, you know, don't tweet about vaccines, don't put on Facebook about vaccines, no, we will do that.
[00:08:27.942 --> 00:08:29.183]  We will not be moved.
[00:08:29.183 --> 00:08:31.244]  We stand as a rock against tyranny.
[00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:35.346]  So, that's where we stand.
[00:08:35.346 --> 00:08:42.229]  And so, that's what Alex is going to be addressing in the second hour in an emergency message to President Trump.
[00:08:45.114 --> 00:08:51.852]  Now I know President Trump is smart and obviously he is the main reason why he won, but I hope
[00:08:53.010 --> 00:09:00.774]  I hope that he understands that it was Ann Coulter, Michael Savage, and Alex Jones that won him the Republican nomination.
[00:09:00.774 --> 00:09:10.720]  He would have never gotten out of that Republican nomination process if it wasn't for alternative media and the likes of Ann Coulter, Michael Savage, and of course Alex Jones.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:18.684]  But the Alex Jones audience is just the massive active audience that is just so fierce
[00:09:20.646 --> 00:09:25.910]  And they get so fired up when we get behind a movement that that's what pushed Trump over the edge.
[00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:33.755]  So it was really this audience, but it was those three in the media who are all being censored that
[00:09:34.909 --> 00:09:48.277]  Were the voices in the wilderness supporting Donald Trump when all the other media said it was bad, and he would never win, he never wanted to win, he's a joker, he's a clown, all you Trump supporters are jokesters and clowns, you'll never go anywhere.
[00:09:48.277 --> 00:09:53.280]  These are some of your favorite voices on Fox News and on the radio.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:01.685]  And what's even wilder, if you went back four years ago, or let's say you go back to the year 2015,
[00:10:05.393 --> 00:10:07.634]  And you're watching Fox News?
[00:10:07.634 --> 00:10:10.675]  You wouldn't even recognize it.
[00:10:10.675 --> 00:10:20.138]  It is so much different today than it was in 2015.
[00:10:20.138 --> 00:10:23.279]  So, we've got all that coming up.
[00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:29.701]  We've got the Democrats that were engaged in treason starting to get exposed.
[00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:33.662]  Lisa Page basically admitted all of it in her testimony.
[00:10:35.563 --> 00:11:01.467]  Obama knew they were going to make up a false narrative so that they could then spy on Donald Trump and his campaign and then in turn launch an investigation for Russian collusion all made up, all concocted, all manufactured in the months leading up to the election.
[00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:04.908]  And it's all on record.
[00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:11.145]  And you know where else it's on record?
[00:11:11.145 --> 00:11:14.368]  The Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:11:14.368 --> 00:11:16.770]  Oh, but they erased that, didn't they?
[00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.271]  How convenient!
[00:11:18.271 --> 00:11:32.262]  You see, because they don't want you to be able to go back and watch our videos from years ago out at the front of all of this.
[00:11:32.262 --> 00:11:33.363]  And so that's really
[00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:36.723]  Another level of their censorship.
[00:11:36.723 --> 00:11:48.873]  Yeah, they don't want us to be able to break in to a breaking news story, to a viral news story, to a trending news story, and be there available on the internet at the click of a button when everybody's competing for those views.
[00:11:48.873 --> 00:11:50.094]  They don't want us there.
[00:11:50.094 --> 00:11:51.234]  They want to control the narrative.
[00:11:51.234 --> 00:12:01.523]  But then there's the other angle that's... They don't want you to be able to go and share our old videos where we told you that this was all going on years ago.
[00:12:04.687 --> 00:12:15.034]  They don't want you to go see the videos where we told you Adam Schiff was a lying, corrupt scumbag years ago.
[00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:22.238]  They don't want you to see the election night videos where Alex Jones said, President Trump, this is just the beginning.
[00:12:22.238 --> 00:12:22.759]  Get ready.
[00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:25.941]  They're going to come at you with everything they have.
[00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.331]  And they did.
[00:12:27.331 --> 00:12:30.173]  They came after him with Hollywood, Jussie Smollett.
[00:12:30.173 --> 00:12:34.976]  They came after him with the mainstream media, Covington Catholic, Judge Kavanaugh.
[00:12:34.976 --> 00:12:37.718]  Trump's a racist, Trump is this, Trump is that.
[00:12:37.718 --> 00:12:40.740]  They came after him with the Department of Justice.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.501]  They came after him with the FISA courts.
[00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:45.323]  They came after him with the Southern District of New York.
[00:12:45.323 --> 00:12:47.925]  They came after him with the appellate courts.
[00:12:47.925 --> 00:12:50.347]  They came after him with the New York Attorney General.
[00:12:50.347 --> 00:12:52.749]  They came after... So, non-stop!
[00:12:56.636 --> 00:13:01.559]  And then there's a series of tweets from President Trump that we will be breaking down today as well.
[00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:03.980]  And think about this.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:25.371]  As we're just now beginning to see what we already knew was going on inside the FBI treason trying to remove Trump from office, how about the College Gate scandal and the fact that you didn't ever hear one leak, not a single leak, when it came to the College Gate scandal?
[00:13:26.351 --> 00:13:28.473]  How incredible is that?
[00:13:28.473 --> 00:13:38.220]  And I guarantee you can take it to the bank that Cortez now wants to blame for everything.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.221]  When anything goes wrong, she wants the bank to pay for it.
[00:13:40.221 --> 00:13:47.466]  Yeah, that's actually her new profound theory.
[00:13:47.466 --> 00:13:49.908]  If it would have been Donald Trump
[00:13:50.902 --> 00:14:15.332]  Engaged in photoshopping pictures, or Ann Coulter engaged in paying bribes, or Alex Jones, or any conservative involved in any of this stuff, it would have all been leaked, it would have all been already out there, and they would have already been using it years ago to destroy those people.
[00:14:15.332 --> 00:14:18.573]  And so, you can apply that same
[00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:40.141]  Logic, if you will, to the investigation that's going on right now into James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Lisa Page, Peter Stroke, and their cohorts.
[00:14:40.141 --> 00:14:49.527]  So you won't know really the full scope of it until they release it because it's not going to get leaked like everything that Mueller tries to do.
[00:14:52.183 --> 00:15:01.445]  But President Trump says on Twitter this morning, keep America great.
[00:15:01.445 --> 00:15:11.288]  Well, President Trump, if you want to keep America great, you're going to have to start locking some people up and throwing away the key.
[00:15:11.288 --> 00:15:19.230]  Because if you don't make an example of these treasonous scumbags,
[00:15:20.256 --> 00:15:27.999]  In these unelected bureaucracies, thinking they run this republic, they'll never stop.
[00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:31.841]  They'll never stop.
[00:15:31.841 --> 00:15:33.281]  And maybe these people will stop.
[00:15:33.281 --> 00:15:40.705]  Maybe you think you can stop these people from continuing in their criminal activity, but they'll just be another round.
[00:15:40.705 --> 00:15:43.006]  They'll just be another wave.
[00:15:43.006 --> 00:15:48.148]  You need to make an example of these people loud and clear.

[00:16:00.725 --> 00:16:04.646]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:04.646 --> 00:16:06.186]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:06.186 --> 00:16:09.147]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:09.147 --> 00:16:14.348]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:48.121]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:16:48.121 --> 00:16:49.402]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:16:49.402 --> 00:16:50.382]  Who do we fight for?

[00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.053]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:25.257]  Today and now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:30.213]  Alright, here's what we got coming up for the remainder of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.213 --> 00:20:37.137]  In the next segment, Alex Jones is going to be responding and breaking down the College Gate scandal.
[00:20:37.137 --> 00:20:51.427]  He is then going to stay with us and talk about the fake hate crimes as Smollett's legal team, if you can believe this or not, says that the case against Smollett is weak.
[00:20:51.427 --> 00:20:51.667]  Wow.
[00:20:54.437 --> 00:20:56.360]  I don't know how that's a weak case.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.481]  It's all on record.
[00:20:57.481 --> 00:21:01.226]  The guy went on TV.
[00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:05.812]  But that just shows you what kind of lawyer represents Jussie Smollett.
[00:21:07.369 --> 00:21:16.858]  Then, at 12.06, to begin the third hour, that is when Alex is going to give his emergency message to President Trump.
[00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:25.006]  And I will point you in the direction of a Breitbart interview with President Trump, where President Trump said, in response,
[00:21:26.052 --> 00:21:27.934]  To social media censorship.
[00:21:27.934 --> 00:21:30.977]  You fight it by just being good.
[00:21:30.977 --> 00:21:32.599]  You got to be really good.
[00:21:32.599 --> 00:21:37.163]  It's much harder for a conservative Republican to win than it is for a liberal Democrat."
[00:21:37.163 --> 00:21:45.312]  Well, President Trump, what if you would have just decided to quote, be really good during the campaign process?
[00:21:45.312 --> 00:21:48.335]  What if you decided to quote, be really good
[00:21:49.736 --> 00:21:51.536]  During the nomination process.
[00:21:51.536 --> 00:21:59.198]  What if the President decided to be really good during all those press conferences and presidential debates?
[00:21:59.198 --> 00:22:01.118]  Do you think he would have won?
[00:22:01.118 --> 00:22:08.439]  Do you think America would have heard Donald Trump?
[00:22:08.439 --> 00:22:11.060]  Do you think they would have responded the way they did?
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.841]  No, I do not think so, President.
[00:22:14.841 --> 00:22:16.481]  So Alex will be responding to that.
[00:22:16.481 --> 00:22:16.741]  Then,
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:25.843]  I'm going to open up the phone lines and I'm going to ask you one simple question.
[00:22:25.843 --> 00:22:33.947]  What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[00:22:33.947 --> 00:22:40.669]  And what I'd like to do is to just rattle off about 15 calls from 1220 Central,
[00:22:42.742 --> 00:22:48.746]  To 106 Central, when Caitlin Bennett joins us, and then after she leaves, probably too.
[00:22:48.746 --> 00:22:57.032]  And I just want you to have one quick answer, and I just want to go down the line, just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:22:57.032 --> 00:22:59.154]  I want to hear from everybody.
[00:22:59.154 --> 00:23:04.958]  What must the President do to keep America great?
[00:23:04.958 --> 00:23:07.940]  This is my new hat that I got now, a gift from my chiropractor.
[00:23:09.938 --> 00:23:12.338]  Keep America Great.
[00:23:12.338 --> 00:23:16.479]  And the President tweeted that out this morning, too.
[00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:24.161]  What must President Trump do to keep America Great?
[00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:26.521]  So we will be opening up the phone lines in the next hour.
[00:23:26.521 --> 00:23:27.781]  That is my question for you.
[00:23:27.781 --> 00:23:30.642]  Please just have a one response.
[00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:36.363]  Obviously, there's a lot of things, but just pick your most important thing, say it, and we'll go to the next caller.
[00:23:41.038 --> 00:23:43.259]  I've also just got stacks of news.
[00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:46.040]  And here's the good thing about it.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:55.223]  I don't feel as... See, some days if I don't get to the news and I don't give you the InfoWars coverage, then you're just not going to get it.
[00:23:55.223 --> 00:24:00.085]  But everyone's talking about Lisa Page and Peter Stroke and Bruce Ohr and Adam Schiff.
[00:24:00.085 --> 00:24:02.346]  So everybody already knows how corrupt that they are.
[00:24:02.346 --> 00:24:04.207]  We already kind of broke the floodgates on that.
[00:24:04.207 --> 00:24:06.868]  So it's like I don't necessarily even need to go down that road.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.521]  Everybody's showing you the college scandal.
[00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:14.923]  Everybody sees how it's a bunch of Hillary Clinton donors and liberal progressive Democrats.
[00:24:14.923 --> 00:24:18.565]  I mean, literally, like, the whole list, all of them.
[00:24:18.565 --> 00:24:23.808]  You know, they can't go the old-fashioned way, you know, oh, hey, you know, help my kid get in the...
[00:24:24.804 --> 00:24:32.688]  School, I'll buy you a new rec center, help my kid get into the volleyball program or whatever, I'll buy you a new library, I'll buy you a new computer lab.
[00:24:32.688 --> 00:24:33.748]  Oh wow!
[00:24:33.748 --> 00:24:43.033]  And so it's not like Lori Loughlin has the Lori Loughlin Computer Lab at USC with her daughter who's probably worth millions too.
[00:24:44.465 --> 00:24:46.367]  Yeah, because, you know, they can't afford that.
[00:24:46.367 --> 00:24:53.333]  So no, it's not the Lori Loughlin computer lab that kids are going to be going to and learning and using to resource and read and everything.
[00:24:53.333 --> 00:24:53.893]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:24:53.893 --> 00:24:56.495]  It's just take my money and let my daughter in.
[00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:59.958]  No one else gets nothing except us.
[00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:04.162]  And so then the good liberal Democrats take the money, cheat the college system.
[00:25:05.899 --> 00:25:08.060]  Bing bang boom, no one benefits but them.
[00:25:25.646 --> 00:25:28.468]  And you know, so they just want to have their kids go to college.
[00:25:28.468 --> 00:25:29.809]  They want their kids to have the best time.
[00:25:29.809 --> 00:25:31.690]  So I'm kind of like, for a second, empathetic.
[00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:32.810]  And then I realized, wait a second.
[00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:33.831]  No, no, no, no.
[00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:36.833]  If they wanted what's best for their kids, they wouldn't pay their way.
[00:25:36.833 --> 00:25:39.795]  If they wanted what's best for their kids, they would make them earn it.
[00:25:39.795 --> 00:25:44.638]  If they wanted what's best for their kids, they wouldn't lie to their kids about how they got into school.
[00:25:44.638 --> 00:25:50.081]  And then, once I realized that, I realized, oh my gosh.
[00:25:50.081 --> 00:25:52.823]  It was never even about the kids going to school.
[00:25:52.823 --> 00:25:54.344]  It was about their ego.
[00:25:55.615 --> 00:26:02.700]  It was about Lori Loughlin standing up and saying, my daughter goes to USC as in such and such.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.500]  And all the other ones.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.582]  My daughter went here and was in the crew.
[00:26:05.582 --> 00:26:09.024]  My daughter went here and was part of this program.
[00:26:09.024 --> 00:26:11.165]  It was all about their own ego.
[00:26:11.165 --> 00:26:13.867]  It was never about their kids.
[00:26:13.867 --> 00:26:16.929]  It was never about anyone else but their own ego.
[00:26:16.929 --> 00:26:18.210]  But Alex will be responding to that.
[00:26:20.472 --> 00:26:25.980]  But here's some of the bull crap that's in the news today that you're not going to get anywhere else.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.422]  Manicues of sexual assault.
[00:26:29.286 --> 00:26:30.306]  Was an illegal immigrant.
[00:26:30.306 --> 00:26:31.627]  I mean, I could read these every day.
[00:26:31.627 --> 00:26:32.887]  Illegal immigrant rapes nine.
[00:26:32.887 --> 00:26:33.828]  Illegal immigrant murders.
[00:26:33.828 --> 00:26:34.928]  Illegal immigrant steals.
[00:26:34.928 --> 00:26:36.028]  Illegal immigrant drunk drives.
[00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:37.009]  Illegal immigrant ransom.
[00:26:37.009 --> 00:26:39.850]  I mean, it's every damn day, but you know, it's not a problem.
[00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:45.632]  Woman told to cover up before flying out of diverse UK city of Birmingham by Paul Joseph Watson of wars.com.
[00:26:45.632 --> 00:26:49.773]  The girl basically has, I mean, what the average American girl wears out on a Saturday night.
[00:26:49.773 --> 00:26:52.114]  So yeah, imagine that.
[00:26:52.114 --> 00:26:53.835]  American women, you want to fight for
[00:26:54.727 --> 00:26:58.048]  quote-unquote diversity and the hijab and Islam.
[00:26:58.048 --> 00:27:03.910]  Well, get ready to cover yourself up because you won't be wearing a crop top anymore.
[00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:09.932]  CDC reports 228 measles cases in 12 states and guess who they're blaming?
[00:27:09.932 --> 00:27:12.593]  Unvaccinated Americans.
[00:27:12.593 --> 00:27:17.434]  No, not the open borders that have been proven to be bringing these people in.
[00:27:17.434 --> 00:27:19.335]  No, it's the unvaccinated people.
[00:27:19.335 --> 00:27:20.135]  So now in Italy,
[00:27:21.152 --> 00:27:24.253]  They're telling you you have to take a vaccine or you're not going to school.
[00:27:24.253 --> 00:27:25.153]  Get ready.
[00:27:25.153 --> 00:27:26.433]  That's coming here.
[00:27:26.433 --> 00:27:29.154]  That's why you're seeing all the vaccine propaganda now.
[00:27:29.154 --> 00:27:31.194]  Even Kim Kardashian.
[00:27:31.194 --> 00:27:32.194]  Ooh.
[00:27:32.194 --> 00:27:34.635]  Even Kim K wants you to vaccinate your kids.
[00:27:34.635 --> 00:27:35.875]  Thank you, Kim.
[00:27:35.875 --> 00:27:37.395]  Yes.
[00:27:37.395 --> 00:27:45.757]  I mean, it's not like Kim hasn't had a few needles injecting silicone and collagen and God knows what else into her.
[00:27:45.757 --> 00:27:47.097]  Maybe a little ambrosia?
[00:27:47.097 --> 00:27:47.237]  But, uh...
[00:27:50.973 --> 00:27:53.695]  No, because we will stand in the way of forced vaccinations.

[00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:01.640]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.944]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.944 --> 00:29:08.546]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.546 --> 00:29:16.892]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:29:24.577 --> 00:29:26.739]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:26.739 --> 00:29:31.243]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:31.243 --> 00:29:33.425]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:29:33.425 --> 00:29:41.271]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:29:41.331 --> 00:29:43.212]  I've got some really good news though.
[00:30:02.774 --> 00:30:04.135]  X2's back.
[00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:05.896]  The original X2.
[00:30:05.896 --> 00:30:06.857]  Deep Earth Crystal.
[00:30:06.857 --> 00:30:08.799]  Pure atomic iodine.

[00:30:17.925 --> 00:30:18.906]  I thought X3's great.
[00:30:18.906 --> 00:30:22.929]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source, but I thought add the other two types of iodine.
[00:30:22.929 --> 00:30:24.290]  The scientists that do that.
[00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.091]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[00:30:26.912 --> 00:30:31.295]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[00:30:31.295 --> 00:30:35.378]  We now have X2 again, and in FullWorthStore.com, so hallelujah!
[00:30:35.378 --> 00:30:47.085]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.

[00:32:05.108 --> 00:32:13.670]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.651]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:32:16.651 --> 00:32:18.391]  How can I solve that problem?

[00:32:42.959 --> 00:32:44.780]  I've got two in my home.

[00:33:20.822 --> 00:33:26.467]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:26.467 --> 00:33:31.431]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.431 --> 00:33:36.455]  The news broke yesterday like a thousand thunderbolts.
[00:33:36.455 --> 00:33:40.858]  It was the top story, not just here in the U.S., but across the world.
[00:33:40.858 --> 00:33:42.720]  Could you believe it?
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:49.105]  A massive, reported, organized crime network
[00:33:50.270 --> 00:34:15.667]  Getting thousands and thousands of illegitimate students who couldn't pass the grades and who couldn't even supposedly play the sports in many cases to get the scholarships had paid in some cases $6.5 million on the high end to just get admission into these colleges.
[00:34:17.304 --> 00:34:19.125]  How could it ever happen?
[00:34:19.125 --> 00:34:29.148]  The CNN headline and the ABC News headline and all the other headlines I saw read, the college admissions scam.
[00:34:29.148 --> 00:34:41.271]  But I had a lot of trouble finding the word conspiracy, even though in the press conference the FBI called it a conspiracy, and even though in the criminal filings it's called a criminal conspiracy.
[00:34:41.271 --> 00:34:43.692]  But you see the media, the corporate media has taught us,
[00:34:45.066 --> 00:34:46.627]  That there's never conspiracies.
[00:34:46.627 --> 00:34:57.471]  At Bayer Pharmaceutical, 20 years ago, for more than five years, to knowingly put HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C in the Factor VIII blood product that killed millions.
[00:34:57.471 --> 00:34:59.591]  Of course, it came out in their own documents.
[00:34:59.591 --> 00:35:05.634]  They knew and thought it was funny and said it would make more money if they just dumped it on the market.
[00:35:05.634 --> 00:35:07.995]  And, by the way, there's too many hemophiliacs.
[00:35:07.995 --> 00:35:09.815]  That's what they said.
[00:35:09.815 --> 00:35:10.636]  It's this eugenics
[00:35:12.219 --> 00:35:16.402]  Angles, they always have an excuse, but I digress.
[00:35:16.402 --> 00:35:23.808]  Going back, when two men or two women or two people get together and decide they're going to rob a bank and they plan it out.
[00:35:23.808 --> 00:35:28.832]  They decide the day and the time and who's going to say get on the floor and who's going to load the bags full of money.
[00:35:28.832 --> 00:35:31.535]  It's a conspiracy.
[00:35:31.535 --> 00:35:39.141]  But when babies get thrown on incubators and their brains bashed out and Congress is told we have to go to war that kills millions, we later learn it didn't happen.
[00:35:39.141 --> 00:35:40.502]  Well, you're not supposed to ask questions.
[00:35:42.151 --> 00:36:08.711]  In the future about big events and so they've so demonized the word conspiracy that the word conspiracy can't exist when we just had the Oxycontin Company knowingly again over 15 years ago planning the rollout of very addictive drugs to dominate all other opioids to be so strong that no one even wanted the regular opioids and then to even have drugs to take you off the opioids later.
[00:36:09.952 --> 00:36:12.573]  That's a cut and dry total conspiracy.
[00:36:12.573 --> 00:36:15.754]  And it's all come out in the criminal filings.
[00:36:15.754 --> 00:36:17.695]  It's all come out in the lawsuits.
[00:36:17.695 --> 00:36:19.015]  See how that works.
[00:36:19.015 --> 00:36:26.398]  So again, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not hit a giant conspiracy.
[00:36:26.398 --> 00:36:37.602]  And so you read through this latest situation and how from Division One sports right through the whole system, from the time kids were in high school, their parents
[00:36:38.717 --> 00:37:00.775]  We're already spending on average over a million dollars in charitable donations to all these different organizations, all these different college groups, all these different art groups, all these different human rights groups that are all laundering the money where these people sit on top of these thousands of non-profits, mainly leftist non-profits.
[00:37:00.775 --> 00:37:05.239]  Remember the IRS wouldn't give conservative non-profits for like eight years under Obama?
[00:37:06.104 --> 00:37:09.946]  But the Democrats and the Liberals, they all get the non-profits.
[00:37:09.946 --> 00:37:14.929]  And then the money's laundered through, not just on this college admissions scam.
[00:37:14.929 --> 00:37:18.291]  There's all sorts of scams out there to get a liver or to get a kidney.
[00:37:18.291 --> 00:37:21.793]  There's all sorts of scams to get a media job in major markets.
[00:37:21.793 --> 00:37:23.174]  You've got to pay people off.
[00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:25.215]  This is all going on at the surface.
[00:37:25.215 --> 00:37:27.556]  And the corruption is just intensifying.
[00:37:27.556 --> 00:37:31.459]  So I applaud the FBI for going after this scam.
[00:37:33.183 --> 00:37:36.627]  Isn't it really true that college itself is a scam now?
[00:37:36.627 --> 00:37:45.656]  As we put all this government funding behind it and make it politically correct with all the affirmative action, all we do is turn it into more of a fraud.
[00:37:45.656 --> 00:37:53.924]  As you put more money behind something and basically try to force people to attend it, it drives up the price, just like healthcare with Obamacare.
[00:37:56.308 --> 00:38:03.784]  Pulling back from the whole thing, about 90%, even Money Magazine and Forbes have met this, about 90% of college degrees never pay off.
[00:38:03.784 --> 00:38:05.748]  They never pay off the loans.
[00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:19.840]  By that, most people pay off the loans, but the amount of money you spend, the amount of loan payments that you end up paying, you never get that money back from the jobs that you get via the degree.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:23.183]  And so people then go and start collecting degrees like baseball cards.
[00:38:23.183 --> 00:38:24.744]  Degree after degree.
[00:38:24.744 --> 00:38:26.105]  Yes, you need an engineering degree.
[00:38:26.105 --> 00:38:27.867]  Yes, you need a medical degree.
[00:38:27.867 --> 00:38:30.930]  Yes, you need a legal degree if you're going to be in those professions.
[00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.412]  But the liberal arts and all the rest of it,
[00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:36.922]  Are degrees in search of jobs.
[00:38:36.922 --> 00:38:41.944]  And that's the big leftist global conspiracy that the Rockefellers wrote about and talked about 60 years ago.
[00:38:41.944 --> 00:38:49.547]  That they would create all these degrees of, quote, environmental protection and social worker and all the rest of it.
[00:38:49.547 --> 00:38:50.988]  And then they wouldn't have real jobs.
[00:38:50.988 --> 00:39:01.252]  So those people will then become lobbies to lobby government to create a controlled economy where those jobs were mandated so that they would have a place for their worthless degrees.
[00:39:01.252 --> 00:39:03.473]  That's what the carbon taxes and all of this are about.
[00:39:04.244 --> 00:39:06.426]  So there you have it.
[00:39:06.426 --> 00:39:09.169]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and millions.
[00:39:09.169 --> 00:39:10.850]  They're saying it could be in the billions and billions.
[00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:12.992]  No one knows the numbers yet.
[00:39:12.992 --> 00:39:15.074]  Multi-year investigation.
[00:39:15.074 --> 00:39:15.995]  Deep inside.
[00:39:15.995 --> 00:39:20.999]  Even CNN and others are saying it's open and shut.
[00:39:20.999 --> 00:39:26.785]  Oh, but then if we question other big events or other big happenings, we're the bad guys.
[00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:30.841]  No, ladies and gentlemen, take vaccines.
[00:39:30.841 --> 00:39:39.466]  The inserts of every major vaccine say they can kill you, cause Guillain-Barré's, neurological disorders, narcolepsy, cancer.
[00:39:39.466 --> 00:39:40.126]  Read it.
[00:39:40.126 --> 00:39:43.508]  Not the fact sheet they give you at the pharmacy.
[00:39:43.508 --> 00:39:44.449]  Not the quote fact sheet.
[00:39:44.449 --> 00:39:47.791]  You want the insert under law that's in the packages.
[00:39:47.791 --> 00:39:54.555]  By the way, there's been bills introduced the last four years consecutively to, by federal law, remove the inserts and not let you have them.
[00:39:56.024 --> 00:39:57.987]  So what do you have, Adam Schiff?
[00:39:57.987 --> 00:40:05.837]  He put pressure on Amazon to remove best-selling documentaries with medical doctors talking about the dangers of vaccines.
[00:40:05.837 --> 00:40:07.339]  Removed!
[00:40:07.339 --> 00:40:09.702]  That was just yesterday.
[00:40:09.702 --> 00:40:12.725]  They're coming for our free speech because Big Pharma.
[00:40:13.735 --> 00:40:20.057]  The same ones that put you on weaponized heroin, synthetic heroin on purpose, and flood the market with it.
[00:40:20.057 --> 00:40:23.838]  The same ones that give you HIV through their blood products on purpose.
[00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:31.641]  You know, the Clintons, for over a decade, had the state certify blood out of prisons full of HIV and hepatitis, and they made millions as well.
[00:40:31.641 --> 00:40:36.403]  This is a culture of pure evil, and they don't want you questioning it.
[00:40:36.403 --> 00:40:39.104]  They go, oh look, we've got a bunch of measles and mumps.
[00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:42.025]  And then you dig into it, it's almost all illegal aliens coming in.
[00:40:43.118 --> 00:40:51.743]  Unvetted, untested, with hepatitis and drug-resistant TB, and even cholera, and even the Black Plague, and even leprosy.
[00:40:51.743 --> 00:40:53.043]  But all that gets covered up.
[00:40:53.043 --> 00:40:56.225]  And it's just, oh, diseases are on the rise in some areas.
[00:40:56.225 --> 00:41:03.349]  We need to arrest anyone that doesn't take the vaccines, when the vaccines are Trojan horse systems with liability protection.
[00:41:04.989 --> 00:41:05.810]  It's out of control.
[00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:07.151]  It's a recipe for disaster.
[00:41:07.151 --> 00:41:25.386]  So I would just expect Congress to pass a Liability Protection Act or something to say that big colleges can just fix degrees and you just pay for the highest bidder and we'll just start giving triple doctorates and PhDs to rich guys, morons, sons and daughters that can't even tie their shoelaces.
[00:41:25.386 --> 00:41:27.308]  Because that's where all this is going.
[00:41:28.356 --> 00:41:31.499]  But this is a good step in the right direction, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:31.499 --> 00:41:45.154]  But if you go to UT or any other big university, I've been down there, I've looked at them, it looks like a bunch of lobotomized zombies from Day of the Dead meets Hell on Earth, Omega Man, I Am Legend.
[00:41:45.154 --> 00:41:50.399]  And we have created a system where we don't really challenge people, and it's created a mess and it's out of control.
[00:41:50.399 --> 00:41:50.839]  But there you go.
[00:41:52.421 --> 00:41:56.162]  The Big Giant College Admissions Conspiracy.
[00:41:56.162 --> 00:42:00.404]  The College Admissions Conspiracy.
[00:42:00.404 --> 00:42:01.664]  The rest of the story.
[00:42:01.664 --> 00:42:03.465]  That's what this is.
[00:42:03.465 --> 00:42:04.425]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:42:04.425 --> 00:42:05.765]  Back to Owen Schroer.
[00:42:05.765 --> 00:42:09.386]  More special reports I'm filing throughout this hour and the next.
[00:42:09.386 --> 00:42:10.327]  Please stay with us.
[00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:12.327]  Because only you can spread the live links.
[00:42:12.327 --> 00:42:13.548]  Only you can spread the articles.
[00:42:13.548 --> 00:42:15.769]  Only you can override the censors.
[00:42:15.769 --> 00:42:16.929]  And you've been doing it.
[00:42:16.929 --> 00:42:18.329]  And I salute you.
[00:42:18.329 --> 00:42:19.590]  We're in it to win it together.
[00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:19.990]  God bless.
[00:42:23.063 --> 00:42:41.269]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, when we come back, Alex is going to be talking about staged hate crimes, like the Jussie Smollett case, where his team of lawyers are now saying that it's a flimsy case against him.
[00:42:41.269 --> 00:42:43.690]  So let's see, he cut the check, we have the check.
[00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:57.538]  We have him going on national television saying the whole thing, the people that he hired to fake the hate crime admitted it, the police investigated it, the whole thing's been exposed, but a nice dirty Hollywood crook lawyer says there's no case here!
[00:42:57.538 --> 00:43:11.802]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[00:43:12.944 --> 00:43:25.310]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:27.231]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:29.893]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[00:43:31.351 --> 00:43:31.651]  Years ago.
[00:43:59.545 --> 00:44:05.574]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food during the fall, so you have it during the winter.
[00:44:05.574 --> 00:44:08.498]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[00:44:08.498 --> 00:44:13.085]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply, one of the top
[00:44:14.113 --> 00:44:23.256]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[00:44:45.607 --> 00:44:48.150]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:53.157]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:58.545]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[00:45:00.165 --> 00:45:10.768]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:45:10.768 --> 00:45:12.828]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:45:12.828 --> 00:45:15.689]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:45:15.689 --> 00:45:17.190]  It's made in the USA.
[00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:24.011]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:45:24.011 --> 00:45:25.272]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[00:45:26.092 --> 00:45:35.799]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:52.611]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:45:52.611 --> 00:45:55.773]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.

[00:47:03.371 --> 00:47:06.014]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:11.505 --> 00:47:16.505]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:29.354]  Years ago, InfoWars.com published extensive stories showing hundreds and hundreds of examples of staged fake hate crimes.
[00:47:29.354 --> 00:47:41.919]  Now, we've been a little busy covering other issues in the last few years, but Breitbart picked up where we left off, and they've published articles showing hundreds of cases where there were staged leftist attacks on themselves.
[00:47:42.799 --> 00:47:52.665]  But now, CNN and others are reporting the California high school that was visited by a Holocaust survivor suddenly had swastikas put up after the woman left.
[00:47:52.665 --> 00:47:54.326]  Now this may well have happened.
[00:47:54.326 --> 00:47:59.089]  I'm not accusing the old woman or anybody else at the school of staging anything.
[00:47:59.089 --> 00:48:07.034]  I'm simply saying since almost every other case has been staged, including, remember Trump, right after he got elected, got blamed for being anti-Semitic.
[00:48:07.534 --> 00:48:14.376]  Because he didn't do enough about somebody coming over Jewish gravestones and putting swastikas on synagogues in New Jersey?
[00:48:14.376 --> 00:48:17.917]  And I said it was probably staged by some leftists to blame Trump.
[00:48:17.917 --> 00:48:24.278]  Hell, why was the media jumping on incidents that are disgusting but still non-violent?
[00:48:24.278 --> 00:48:29.480]  On the radar screen, not a major crime, a distasteful crime, a bad thing.
[00:48:31.721 --> 00:48:33.081]  Why were they focusing on it?
[00:48:33.081 --> 00:48:35.722]  Because obviously the fix was in, it was staged.
[00:48:35.722 --> 00:48:41.024]  And Trump came out and said he thought it was staged because he talked to the state police and they called him anti-Semitic.
[00:48:41.024 --> 00:48:46.225]  For that it turned out it had been staged by leftists to make Trump look bad.
[00:48:46.225 --> 00:48:55.708]  And so all I'm saying is with the Jesse Smollett situation and all these other big events that just go on and on, we have a right and a duty to
[00:48:58.439 --> 00:49:00.500]  This is getting massive, massive coverage.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:14.788]  And you tie that in to the college admissions scam, which is really the college admissions conspiracy, and the drug company documents that have come out where they're purposely trying to get people addicted to opioids, where they're purposefully trying to get people HIV, Bayer.
[00:49:14.788 --> 00:49:18.149]  I mean, you cannot make this stuff up.
[00:49:18.149 --> 00:49:20.911]  And that's why I'm so concerned about Congressman Schiff.
[00:49:21.914 --> 00:49:33.964]  Demanding that Amazon take down best-selling documentaries that are very popular, but even if they weren't popular, people have a right to put out movies saying the moon is made of cheese, or the Easter Bunny's real.
[00:49:33.964 --> 00:49:47.756]  But they're saying because we've got some of these diseases coming into the U.S., and because we've got a few things like mumps and things, and the measles going up, that we must absolutely ban anyone questioning vaccines.
[00:49:47.756 --> 00:49:48.477]  Well, that's crazy!
[00:49:49.838 --> 00:49:54.159]  That's like saying because we had people breaking their legs, we shouldn't question opioids.
[00:49:54.159 --> 00:49:58.280]  Vaccines, ladies and gentlemen, have been caught being tainted over and over again.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.661]  Since the 1980s, they're given liability protection.
[00:50:00.661 --> 00:50:08.183]  They've caught the UN adding sterilants to vaccines in Africa and in the Middle East and in Central Asia and Pakistan.
[00:50:08.183 --> 00:50:10.424]  Look it up.
[00:50:10.424 --> 00:50:16.666]  There is a giant Bill and Melinda Gates operation dealing with the vaccines, and this is just incredibly dangerous.
[00:50:16.666 --> 00:50:17.506]  But getting back.
[00:50:18.601 --> 00:50:23.085]  Getting back to the situation on California.
[00:50:23.085 --> 00:50:26.088]  Of course there's rigged systems in the stock market.
[00:50:26.088 --> 00:50:33.055]  Of course there's rigged deals with people buying admission to colleges, in some cases spending 6.5 million dollars.
[00:50:33.055 --> 00:50:40.742]  Of course there's all sorts of scams and arms dealing and people buying off politicians and giving major contributions so they get the construction
[00:50:41.683 --> 00:51:10.488]  Rights and get to rig the no-bid contracts whether it's Halliburton in its history or what goes on in local towns and cities We all know about this and InfoWars is about questioning known scams that are going on and investigating known scams and looking for other scams and That's what we do here at InfoWars and it's why the establishment wants us to shut up Why they want to shut down because they don't want you questioning period so on the subject of
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:12.140]  I don't know.
[00:51:32.424 --> 00:51:34.167]  Oh, the terrible climate of the country.
[00:51:34.167 --> 00:51:35.288]  Oh, all the racism.
[00:51:35.288 --> 00:51:39.333]  Oh, all the anti-Semitism because of people like Trump.
[00:51:39.333 --> 00:51:42.477]  Meanwhile, you've got Ilhan Omar.
[00:51:43.968 --> 00:51:45.349]  What's the new nickname I've given her?
[00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:46.629]  We have AOC.
[00:51:46.629 --> 00:51:53.793]  If you add actually her full name together, I've got it here in the list of things I want to cover.
[00:51:53.793 --> 00:51:55.755]  It's I-A-O.
[00:51:55.755 --> 00:51:59.497]  Ilhan Abdullahi Omar.
[00:51:59.497 --> 00:52:00.217]  I-A-O.
[00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:01.418]  Sorry, I'm digressing.
[00:52:01.418 --> 00:52:05.140]  She did, by the way, it's confirmed, marry her brother in a scam to get him here.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.681]  Just absolutely incredible.
[00:52:07.681 --> 00:52:11.723]  We wonder why she's so anti-American, why she's so anti-Israel.
[00:52:11.723 --> 00:52:13.844]  What do you think goes on in Somalia?
[00:52:13.844 --> 00:52:15.205]  You're kidnapped in five minutes.
[00:52:16.374 --> 00:52:18.195]  You're almost always robbed and killed.
[00:52:18.195 --> 00:52:24.297]  Their main business is piracy and kidnapping and terrorism.
[00:52:24.297 --> 00:52:31.160]  And then we're going to import massive numbers of these people here and then wonder why the hell, as soon as they get in Congress, they start going crazy.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:34.862]  Because they're diabolically opposed to anybody but their system.
[00:52:34.862 --> 00:52:39.564]  They don't get along with the tribes around them as well and the other Muslims.
[00:52:39.564 --> 00:52:42.425]  A thousand years ago, only a few spots in North Africa had Muslims.
[00:52:42.425 --> 00:52:43.386]  Now it's half Africa.
[00:52:44.295 --> 00:52:45.595]  They're taking over.
[00:52:45.595 --> 00:52:49.317]  There's the House of Islam and the House of War outside of Islam.
[00:52:49.317 --> 00:52:58.200]  So, you've got real threats to the country, you've got real threats to our sovereignty, you've got real threats to our independence and our openness by exporting...
[00:52:59.332 --> 00:53:04.235]  And then importing all these radical jihadists into our country, and it needs to be stopped.
[00:53:04.235 --> 00:53:13.321]  But instead, we get to have the daily dose of a poop swastika, or the Air Force Academy, or the Army Academy at West Point, and on and on and on.
[00:53:13.321 --> 00:53:20.526]  Somebody writes an N-word, you know, in the dorm, and it always turns out a month later, in the back of the newspaper, to have been staged.
[00:53:20.526 --> 00:53:21.807]  So this needs to be investigated.
[00:53:21.807 --> 00:53:23.308]  It needs to be investigated now.
[00:53:23.308 --> 00:53:24.569]  They don't want us to question.
[00:53:24.569 --> 00:53:26.050]  They want to outlaw that.
[00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:28.792]  That's why we're being demonized, why we're being attacked, but it's not working.
[00:53:29.632 --> 00:53:36.075]  In closing, this little analysis I just engaged in, please remember that without you financially supporting us, we're dead in the water.
[00:53:36.075 --> 00:53:44.379]  And we make it so easy to support info wars that then promotes the American way of life, the Second Amendment, the right to life.
[00:53:44.379 --> 00:53:49.021]  We do radical stuff like stand up for babies that are already born and say that it's wrong to harvest their organs.
[00:53:49.021 --> 00:53:49.842]  You know, we're extremists.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:55.861]  When you get the books, when you get the videos, when you get the t-shirts, it gives you more knowledge.
[00:53:55.861 --> 00:53:59.843]  You can then donate the books and videos to the library after you've watched them or read them.
[00:53:59.843 --> 00:54:06.105]  When you wear t-shirts, it helps you meet like-minded people, it helps you spread the word, and it helps promote freedom everywhere.
[00:54:06.105 --> 00:54:11.547]  We've got a bunch of big specials that are about to end at InfoWarsTore.com, so please take advantage today.
[00:54:11.547 --> 00:54:17.969]  But whatever you do, commit to signing up for AutoShed for things like our fluoride-free toothpaste, fortified with oil, silver, and iodine.
[00:54:18.749 --> 00:54:19.049]  I think?
[00:54:34.258 --> 00:54:34.818]  We're good
[00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:06.472]  I gotta take Trump to the woodshed.
[00:55:06.472 --> 00:55:10.476]  This is the worst thing Trump's done so far, and it just confirms some of my fears.
[00:55:10.476 --> 00:55:14.479]  I don't think Trump is bad, but he's going off the rails in some ways.
[00:55:14.479 --> 00:55:21.306]  So at the start of the next hour, I'm going to get into the president and how he's gone off the rails and how we've got to get him back on the rails.
[00:55:21.306 --> 00:55:22.948]  So please stay with us for this critical message.
[00:55:24.155 --> 00:55:33.502]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, now be sure to share the links to this band broadcast so that we can get this message heard and to President Trump.
[00:55:33.502 --> 00:55:37.124]  And, you know, I'll tell you what.
[00:55:37.124 --> 00:55:44.269]  It's totally out of control today because Paul Manafort has now been sentenced to seven and a half years in jail.
[00:55:44.269 --> 00:55:50.034]  Do you understand how egregious and this is such an injustice.
[00:55:50.034 --> 00:55:50.454]  It's like.
[00:55:53.228 --> 00:55:56.149]  It's such an injustice.
[00:55:56.149 --> 00:56:03.312]  Honestly, if we weren't committed to doing this here every day at InfoWars, I'd just quit.
[00:56:03.312 --> 00:56:04.252]  I'd be done.
[00:56:04.252 --> 00:56:06.173]  This is a joke.
[00:56:06.173 --> 00:56:07.774]  It's seriously such a joke.
[00:56:07.774 --> 00:56:10.435]  It's just like, if this is going to go on, what's the point?
[00:56:12.418 --> 00:56:14.059]  So I understand why people don't care.
[00:56:14.059 --> 00:56:15.780]  I understand why people lay it all down.
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:19.002]  I understand why people get caught up in sports and pop culture.
[00:56:19.002 --> 00:56:23.785]  Because, yeah, I mean, Jeffrey Epstein, known pedophile, child sex trafficker.
[00:56:23.785 --> 00:56:25.746]  He's a free man.
[00:56:25.746 --> 00:56:30.609]  Tony Podesta, who was working with Manafort with all these Ukrainian things.
[00:56:30.609 --> 00:56:31.810]  He doesn't even get indicted.
[00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:32.870]  He gets nothing.
[00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:33.891]  He gets total immunity.
[00:56:33.891 --> 00:56:39.454]  Oh, but Paul Manafort gets seven and a half years because he's an associate of Donald Trump and they want to destroy him.
[00:56:39.454 --> 00:56:40.755]  Yeah, great, great.
[00:56:42.472 --> 00:56:49.357]  See, I understand why Americans just cash in and just give up.
[00:56:49.357 --> 00:56:58.123]  And if the President isn't going to do anything about this miscarriage of justice, then, uh... Well, we'll just have to call him out on it.
[00:56:58.123 --> 00:56:59.885]  Continue to do so.
[00:56:59.885 --> 00:57:01.646]  And that's what Alex Jones is going to do in the next segment.
[00:57:02.639 --> 00:57:08.721]  But then you have Senator Blumenthal saying, oh, this is, Manafort's lucky.
[00:57:08.721 --> 00:57:11.862]  He's lucky, he only got seven and a half years.
[00:57:11.862 --> 00:57:15.263]  Okay, Senator Blumenthal, do Epstein now.
[00:57:15.263 --> 00:57:17.584]  Senator Blumenthal, now do Clinton.
[00:57:17.584 --> 00:57:19.705]  Senator Blumenthal, will you do Tony Podesta?
[00:57:19.705 --> 00:57:23.766]  I mean, just F these people, man.
[00:57:23.766 --> 00:57:26.127]  Just F all of them.
[00:57:26.127 --> 00:57:28.528]  It's too bad we've been so cucked.
[00:57:28.528 --> 00:57:30.349]  It's too bad there's no men left anymore.
[00:57:31.602 --> 00:57:33.164]  It's too bad we're dead already.
[00:57:33.164 --> 00:57:36.067]  It's the only way they can get away with this.
[00:57:36.067 --> 00:57:40.052]  It's the only way you can throw Manafort in jail for seven and a half years and Epstein walks free.
[00:57:40.052 --> 00:57:40.833]  Because there's no men!
[00:57:40.833 --> 00:57:42.235]  Because nobody stands up to you!
[00:57:42.235 --> 00:57:43.496]  We're a bunch of cucks!
[00:57:43.496 --> 00:57:44.918]  We're a bunch of pieces of garbage, man.
[00:57:44.918 --> 00:57:45.899]  We just let this happen.
[00:57:45.899 --> 00:57:46.660]  Fine.
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.202]  Just destroy the whole world while you're at it.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.724]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[00:57:52.724 --> 00:57:55.727]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[00:57:55.727 --> 00:58:02.614]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[00:58:02.614 --> 00:58:03.916]  X2 is back.
[00:58:03.916 --> 00:58:04.536]  We got it.
[00:58:04.536 --> 00:58:06.218]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[00:58:06.218 --> 00:58:07.820]  We rushed it into production.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:08.581]  It's been bottled.
[00:58:08.581 --> 00:58:10.283]  The labels are being put on today.
[00:58:10.583 --> 00:58:15.887]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler, right here to Austin, from the plant in the Rockies.
[00:58:15.887 --> 00:58:17.668]  And it's going to be shipped out to you.
[00:58:17.668 --> 00:58:19.169]  Be sure to sign up for AutoShip.
[00:58:19.169 --> 00:58:20.990]  An additional 10% off.
[00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:25.614]  The 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[00:58:25.614 --> 00:58:27.535]  Research the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:58:27.535 --> 00:58:29.316]  Find out why it's so important.
[00:58:29.316 --> 00:58:31.138]  Find out what the globalists don't want you to have.
[00:58:31.718 --> 00:58:32.379]  Uh, the good halogens.
[00:58:32.379 --> 00:58:33.801]  Don't you have the bad halogens?
[00:58:33.801 --> 00:58:35.964]  At InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:35.964 --> 00:58:37.186]  That's the umbrella site.

[01:00:02.555 --> 01:00:05.137]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:05.137 --> 01:00:10.720]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.103]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:00:14.103 --> 01:00:22.288]  You know, if I wasn't principled, I would actually beg Trump to be an authoritarian dictator right now.
[01:00:22.288 --> 01:00:27.431]  Because I think that's the only answer to this crap.
[01:00:27.431 --> 01:00:30.033]  Tucker Carlson is dealing with the hate mob.
[01:00:30.033 --> 01:00:30.694]  He addressed
[01:00:31.516 --> 01:00:36.664]  The potential illegal activity of Media Matters last night in his opening monologue.
[01:00:36.664 --> 01:00:37.986]  Here is that clip.
[01:00:38.905 --> 01:00:45.971]  Media Matters is a George Soros-funded lobbying organization whose sole mission is to punish critics of the Democratic Party.
[01:00:45.971 --> 01:00:54.878]  Media Matters often uses propaganda from the Southern Poverty Law Center to bully corporations, news executives, and tech companies into punishing people it doesn't like.
[01:00:54.878 --> 01:00:58.461]  Not surprisingly, the media love Media Matters.
[01:00:58.461 --> 01:01:05.446]  One former employee described the group's relationship with MSNBC this way, quote, we were pretty much writing their prime time.
[01:01:06.147 --> 01:01:11.229]  When Media Matters issued a press release, MSNBC picked it up, quote, verbatim.
[01:01:11.229 --> 01:01:18.832]  Media Matters staffers once explained that the organization's close relationships with journalists in the National Press Corps were vast.
[01:01:18.832 --> 01:01:20.413]  Here are some quotes.
[01:01:20.413 --> 01:01:24.595]  Quote, Greg Summers... I remember Alex Jones used to report on this years ago when I first started listening.
[01:01:24.595 --> 01:01:30.217]  He literally said everything they do on CNN, mainly MSNBC, and all this mainstream news is just talking points from Media Matters.
[01:01:30.217 --> 01:01:31.998]  Now they just admit it.
[01:01:31.998 --> 01:01:32.818]  ...want him to write.
[01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:36.931]  The people at Huffington Post were always eager to cooperate.
[01:01:36.931 --> 01:01:39.771]  Jim Rainey at the LA Times took a lot of our stuff.
[01:01:39.771 --> 01:01:43.112]  Brian Stelter at the New York Times was helpful.
[01:01:43.112 --> 01:01:44.873]  Well, Brian Stelter has since left the New York Times.
[01:01:44.873 --> 01:01:50.834]  He's now the house eunuch at CNN announcing proclamations from his tiny king, Jeff Zucker.
[01:01:50.834 --> 01:01:54.055]  He takes his talking points, though, still from Media Matter.
[01:01:54.055 --> 01:01:55.055]  Here's Zucker's puppet.
[01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:04.051]  They're a little Brian Stelter puppeteer.
[01:02:04.051 --> 01:02:07.293]  A lot of what Fox does in primetime is resentment television.
[01:02:07.293 --> 01:02:10.776]  Making you resent liberals and others who are trying to hurt you.
[01:02:10.776 --> 01:02:11.997]  That's the message from Fox.
[01:02:11.997 --> 01:02:13.698]  I think all of this matters.
[01:02:13.698 --> 01:02:15.479]  It's about decency and standards.
[01:02:15.479 --> 01:02:22.504]  Coming from the most resentful Humpty Dumpty ever because Trump is in office and CNN is losing.
[01:02:22.504 --> 01:02:23.585]  Involving some of these hosts.
[01:02:23.585 --> 01:02:24.746]  There's no Russian collusion.
[01:02:24.906 --> 01:02:27.410]  It's about decency, cries the eunuch.
[01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.754]  We must have decency!
[01:02:29.754 --> 01:02:33.781]  By which the eunuch means less disobeying, more obedience.
[01:02:33.781 --> 01:02:35.764]  Stop criticizing the program!
[01:02:35.764 --> 01:02:36.225]  Or else.
[01:02:37.298 --> 01:02:39.500]  This is the face of state media.
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.701]  What does Fox even exist, they wonder?
[01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:48.947]  We've got 11 other perfectly good cable channels, all of them approved by management and obedient to the people in charge.
[01:02:48.947 --> 01:02:51.769]  How could anybody watch something different?
[01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:53.390]  Fox can't be legitimate!
[01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:54.951]  They must be lying!
[01:02:54.951 --> 01:02:56.493]  Their viewers must be stupid!
[01:02:57.628 --> 01:03:03.631]  Listen to Don Lamond and the Governor's brother tell you why Fox News shouldn't even be allowed.
[01:03:03.631 --> 01:03:06.172]  As journalists, we have to give you the facts.
[01:03:06.172 --> 01:03:13.815]  What happens there is, you don't talk about the substance of what you said, or if it's factual or not.
[01:03:14.355 --> 01:03:15.256]  You don't talk about that.
[01:03:15.256 --> 01:03:19.319]  What you do is you say, everybody's out to get me.
[01:03:19.319 --> 01:03:21.441]  Everyone is out to get conservatives.
[01:03:21.441 --> 01:03:24.183]  You just say, oh, there's outrage on the left.
[01:03:24.183 --> 01:03:26.805]  And they have Trump derangement syndrome.
[01:03:26.805 --> 01:03:30.328]  And they're always out to look without ever addressing the substance.
[01:03:30.328 --> 01:03:32.049]  They're not about facts, they're about feelings.
[01:03:32.049 --> 01:03:34.712]  But then their audience just eats it up.
[01:03:34.712 --> 01:03:35.812]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:38.615]  Can we have a moment of silence?
[01:03:38.615 --> 01:03:39.996]  I'd like to take a moment of silence.
[01:03:43.641 --> 01:03:51.903]  Intellect, common sense, logic and reasoning are dead.
[01:03:51.903 --> 01:03:54.443]  Okay, continue with Don Lamon.
[01:03:54.443 --> 01:03:57.544]  Don Lamon is calling you dumb.
[01:03:57.544 --> 01:03:59.585]  Savor the moment.
[01:03:59.585 --> 01:04:01.605]  But there's an ominous undertone to all of this.
[01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:02.565]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:04:02.565 --> 01:04:05.106]  It's not just that.
[01:04:05.106 --> 01:04:07.746]  You can hear the full video.
[01:04:07.746 --> 01:04:09.867]  I think it's on InfoWars.com.
[01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:13.892]  It's not just that Don Lamon is calling you dumb.
[01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:18.975]  I mean, they're sitting here... I'm stunned.
[01:04:18.975 --> 01:04:19.956]  I don't even know what to do.
[01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:26.079]  I mean, this... Everything is so ass-backwards right now and the President is just like going along with it.
[01:04:26.079 --> 01:04:27.620]  I mean, I'm just sick of it, dude.
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.762]  I'm just... I'm done.
[01:04:30.762 --> 01:04:32.944]  Manafort gets seven and a half years simply because he...
[01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:34.832]  Work with Trump.
[01:04:34.832 --> 01:04:36.094]  Podesta gets nothing.
[01:04:36.094 --> 01:04:38.076]  Epstein walks free.
[01:04:38.076 --> 01:04:41.980]  CNN is saying that conservatives go by feelings and not facts.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:45.043]  I mean, you people think there's 700 genders?
[01:04:45.043 --> 01:04:45.204]  I mean...
[01:04:49.921 --> 01:04:51.441]  Wow.
[01:04:51.441 --> 01:04:54.722]  Emergency message from Alex Jones on the other side, folks.
[01:04:54.722 --> 01:04:55.743]  Share these links, folks.
[01:04:55.743 --> 01:04:56.583]  Spread the links.
[01:04:56.583 --> 01:04:58.523]  There's nobody left in media that's as real.
[01:04:58.523 --> 01:04:59.024]  It's simple.
[01:04:59.024 --> 01:05:05.145]  If you want to beat the globalists, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[01:05:05.145 --> 01:05:07.626]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:05:07.626 --> 01:05:11.267]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late-term abortion and all the great it is.
[01:05:11.267 --> 01:05:14.028]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:05:14.028 --> 01:05:15.108]  What is the top tumor?
[01:05:15.108 --> 01:05:17.248]  It's a bestseller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:05:17.248 --> 01:05:19.169]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:20.310]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:22.271]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:05:22.271 --> 01:05:26.013]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:05:26.013 --> 01:05:29.035]  I'm like, uh, what's the highest you could do a month later?
[01:05:29.035 --> 01:05:29.315]  Uh, 90, 95%.
[01:05:29.315 --> 01:05:30.876]  No one's ever done that.
[01:05:30.876 --> 01:05:32.677]  I said, how much does that cost a bottle?
[01:05:32.677 --> 01:05:33.618]  It costs $10.
[01:05:33.618 --> 01:05:35.119]  No one's ever done that.
[01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:37.821]  Sir, the average competitor is 3 to 5%.
[01:05:37.821 --> 01:05:38.621]  The top brand's 50%.
[01:05:38.621 --> 01:05:40.522]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:05:41.783 --> 01:05:44.726]  I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information's explosive?
[01:05:44.726 --> 01:05:45.327]  Our fish oil.
[01:05:45.327 --> 01:05:47.850]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:48.931]  My children take it.
[01:05:48.931 --> 01:05:53.256]  You think I'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:05:53.256 --> 01:05:56.279]  You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[01:05:56.279 --> 01:05:56.600]  Never!
[01:06:00.526 --> 01:06:04.168]  With heavy heart, I'm forced to report the facts to you, my friends.
[01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:06.549]  President Trump is betraying America.
[01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:13.072]  President Trump is throwing America's free speech overboard to the wolves of big tech.
[01:06:13.072 --> 01:06:16.514]  President Trump, it appears, has been bought off and is compromised.
[01:06:19.281 --> 01:06:41.931]  A few months ago, I got really angry at my old friend of 20 years, Joe Rogan, because I knew that Joe was smart and that he was aware of the coordinated censorship taking place against nationalists, against conservatives, against Christians, against patriots, and that it was un-American what was happening, and that he has undoubtedly the biggest continual podcast in the world.
[01:06:42.651 --> 01:06:43.291]  That's incredible.
[01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:45.413]  He probably has 10 million listeners a day now.
[01:06:45.413 --> 01:06:54.958]  And I'm very proud that he now has woken up and had my cell phone to 99% positive reviews to say that censorship is wrong and needs to be dealt with.
[01:06:54.958 --> 01:07:00.902]  And he had Jack Dorsey, as he promised me he would do, back on the next week and grilled the hell out of him with Tim Pool.
[01:07:00.902 --> 01:07:11.508]  So when I say this about Trump, I say this because just like Joe needed to be confronted to get him out of his, I guess, malaise, daze, whatever, and I say that lovingly,
[01:07:12.264 --> 01:07:15.388]  President Trump needs to be confronted in hardcore.
[01:07:15.388 --> 01:07:19.593]  Because Trump knows exactly what's going on way more than Joe Rogan does.
[01:07:19.593 --> 01:07:21.194]  In an in-depth Breitbart interview...
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:25.042]  Linked up on Infowars.com that I'll go to in a moment.
[01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:36.051]  Trump lays out the internal videos at Google, at YouTube, at Facebook, at Twitter that myself and Veritas and others got and had put together in legal documents and sent to him last year.
[01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:40.735]  I had three different law firms send three different reports with connections to the White House right to him.
[01:07:40.735 --> 01:07:43.377]  Their response was to ban me off the internet for doing it.
[01:07:44.025 --> 01:07:45.126]  That's how Big Tech responded.
[01:07:45.126 --> 01:07:47.068]  They saw it as a threat, it was, to their tyranny.
[01:07:47.068 --> 01:07:58.060]  They're setting up combines, they're setting up monopolies, they're setting up cartels, they're racketeering, they're violating our civil rights, an organized corporate system to suppress whole groups and classes of people.
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:00.643]  They can argue, well, there's all these things, political oppression.
[01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:01.604]  Yes, there is.
[01:08:01.604 --> 01:08:03.406]  And there are laws against political oppression.
[01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:08.672]  There are also laws on oppressing Christians, and that's the main group that's being targeted.
[01:08:08.672 --> 01:08:11.636]  So, the President has become completely derelict in his duty.
[01:08:11.636 --> 01:08:14.599]  And he gives this big, long interview and says, oh, I know it's terrible.
[01:08:14.599 --> 01:08:17.482]  I've seen the videos where they're coordinating, suppressing us.
[01:08:17.482 --> 01:08:19.104]  We've got to be good.
[01:08:19.104 --> 01:08:21.107]  We've got to really behave ourselves and not get banned.
[01:08:21.647 --> 01:08:24.030]  They're banning Prager University.
[01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:27.615]  They're banning people like the son of Billy Graham.
[01:08:27.615 --> 01:08:29.598]  They're going after everybody.
[01:08:29.598 --> 01:08:31.600]  They want Trump taken off Twitter.
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:34.044]  And then, it's even worse, Mr. President.
[01:08:34.044 --> 01:08:35.786]  You allow Sundar Pichai
[01:08:36.767 --> 01:08:53.273]  The head of Google and the rest of them to go before Congress and say there is no censorship, there is no manipulation of links, that it's all an algorithm when you can go to Google and pay to not just have your story or your video or your movie trailer at the top as an ad, but that you pay now for the top placement.
[01:08:53.273 --> 01:08:56.734]  And we have all the internal Google documents and internal employees.
[01:08:56.734 --> 01:08:58.135]  This stuff comes out every day.
[01:08:58.973 --> 01:09:01.236]  The new Marvel comic movie coming out.
[01:09:01.236 --> 01:09:02.337]  Captain Marvel.
[01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:03.799]  All the documents have come out on that.
[01:09:03.799 --> 01:09:07.543]  All the screenshots, all the internal emails, where it was super unpopular.
[01:09:07.543 --> 01:09:08.804]  So they rigged it.
[01:09:08.804 --> 01:09:12.108]  Rotten Tomatoes was an accurate site until about two years ago.
[01:09:12.108 --> 01:09:13.970]  And Hollywood just bought it off.
[01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:18.075]  So now the worst movies out there get the top reviews and win Oscars.
[01:09:18.075 --> 01:09:19.697]  Just like the college admissions scam.
[01:09:21.117 --> 01:09:23.219]  Conspiracy, just like all of this stuff.
[01:09:23.219 --> 01:09:25.882]  It's rigged, rigged, rigged.
[01:09:25.882 --> 01:09:33.668]  And the Republican neocon bluebloods have been quarterbacking through NewsGuard and these other systems what's actually happening.
[01:09:33.668 --> 01:09:46.420]  There's a partnership between top Republicans and top lobbyists and groups like NewsCorps that want all of the advertising money in elections to go through television and through approved means on the internet.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:55.222]  So they have deals with Facebook, Twitter, and Google to not ban their super PACs, but this is really all to shut down all the small PACs and all the more effective groups.
[01:09:55.222 --> 01:09:56.682]  Well, I'm not involved in a PAC.
[01:09:56.682 --> 01:09:57.922]  I'm not involved in political stuff.
[01:09:57.922 --> 01:09:59.302]  I've never taken political money.
[01:09:59.302 --> 01:10:00.843]  I'm not involved in all that.
[01:10:00.843 --> 01:10:01.603]  I stay out of it.
[01:10:01.603 --> 01:10:03.823]  I am promoting an ideology of freedom.
[01:10:03.823 --> 01:10:11.244]  But the truth is, the Republican Party is bought off and is in bed with Google and Silicon Valley, and it's part of this.
[01:10:11.244 --> 01:10:13.585]  And they've been lobbying Trump at a corporate level.
[01:10:14.265 --> 01:10:26.756]  And they've been giving billions and billions of dollars to the Republicans and Trump is knowingly and consciously cutting us loose, letting us twist in the wind and saying, you go ahead and you censor them as much as you want.
[01:10:26.756 --> 01:10:29.499]  And then he tells us, yeah, I know it's terrible what's happening to you.
[01:10:29.499 --> 01:10:35.244]  And I've been promising an executive order to stop this, but now I'm not even going to do it if I get reelected, he basically says in the interview.
[01:10:35.544 --> 01:10:37.726]  He just goes, you better behave yourself.
[01:10:37.726 --> 01:10:44.471]  That's like telling a woman that gets kidnapped off the street and she's getting gang raped in the back of some van or in some shack out in the countryside.
[01:10:44.471 --> 01:10:49.836]  You know, you better spread your legs good back behind your ears and you better beg them and tell them, you know, that you love it.
[01:10:49.836 --> 01:10:52.838]  And maybe they won't slit your throat.
[01:10:52.838 --> 01:10:55.901]  Trump lied to us about the vaccines and how he was going to expose it.
[01:10:55.901 --> 01:10:59.224]  He knows damn well Barron got hurt by them, but came back, hadn't done it.
[01:10:59.904 --> 01:11:03.686]  He said he would do a lot of other things that he hasn't done.
[01:11:03.686 --> 01:11:06.727]  And now he's starting to make noises against the Second Amendment.
[01:11:06.727 --> 01:11:10.689]  And all I can think is maybe they've compromised the president because he's starting to slide sideways.
[01:11:10.689 --> 01:11:12.770]  I like him standing up against the chi-coms and Huawei.
[01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:14.770]  I like him trying to defend our border.
[01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.591]  I like a lot of the things the president's doing.
[01:11:16.591 --> 01:11:17.912]  He's a hell of a lot better than Hillary Clinton.
[01:11:17.912 --> 01:11:18.612]  But here's the deal.
[01:11:18.612 --> 01:11:20.693]  Hillary Clinton ain't president, son.
[01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:22.914]  We put you in the White House.
[01:11:23.134 --> 01:11:26.437]  And a lot of us had our lives pretty much destroyed trying to get this Republic back.
[01:11:26.437 --> 01:11:33.765]  And now you want to sit there in Breitbart in an insulting, incredibly disgusting exercise.
[01:11:33.765 --> 01:11:38.249]  And you want to sit there and you want to tell us that we've got to just sit there and take it.
[01:11:38.249 --> 01:11:39.250]  Well, I'm not taking it.
[01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:41.032]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, I'm very, very angry.
[01:11:41.032 --> 01:11:41.693]  I'm very, very mad.
[01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:50.836]  The only other time I got this mad at Trump was after they caught the rebels staging three chemical attacks and Trump did the right thing and said, we're not going to war with Syria.
[01:11:50.836 --> 01:11:52.717]  Then he attacked a bunch of the sites.
[01:11:52.717 --> 01:11:53.557]  That really upset.
[01:11:53.557 --> 01:11:56.099]  Later he did actually pull out or attempt to pull out.
[01:11:56.099 --> 01:11:57.540]  And so again, I praise the president for that.
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:06.226]  There's a love-hate situation going on here, because if you read his interview at Breitbart.com, it's posted at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:12:06.226 --> 01:12:07.266]  It's disgusting.
[01:12:07.266 --> 01:12:09.108]  I mean, here, let me pull it up for you right now.
[01:12:09.108 --> 01:12:11.870]  Trump planned to fight big tech censorship.
[01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:12.770]  Listen to this.
[01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:15.452]  Trump planned to fight big tech censorship.
[01:12:15.452 --> 01:12:17.554]  You fight it by just being good.
[01:12:17.554 --> 01:12:19.675]  You've got to be really good.
[01:12:19.675 --> 01:12:21.677]  It's really run by a small number of people.
[01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:29.683]  In an interview with Breitbart News on Monday, President Trump came up short when asked whether he had any plans to fight big tech censorship in the 2020 election.
[01:12:29.683 --> 01:12:33.907]  And he goes on to say, I understand a lot of people wanting to look into it.
[01:12:33.907 --> 01:12:36.569]  I mean, normally, I'd like to say, let it be free.
[01:12:36.569 --> 01:12:37.230]  Let it be free.
[01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:38.731]  But it's not free, Trump said.
[01:12:38.731 --> 01:12:40.412]  It's really run by a small number of people.
[01:12:40.412 --> 01:12:48.379]  The president also referred to reports from Breitbart News exposing tech giants against tech bias against conservatives and companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google.
[01:12:48.379 --> 01:12:49.139]  It's not bias.
[01:12:49.139 --> 01:12:50.621]  It's coordinated censorship.
[01:12:51.221 --> 01:12:52.002]  Now we've seen it.
[01:12:52.002 --> 01:12:52.763]  Now we've caught them.
[01:12:52.763 --> 01:12:54.065]  Now we've seen the speeches.
[01:12:54.065 --> 01:12:57.090]  We've seen the in-house little videos that somehow got released to me.
[01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:58.893]  That's a very big scandal, he said.
[01:12:58.893 --> 01:13:01.697]  Good rhetoric, but zero serious policy proposals.
[01:13:01.697 --> 01:13:05.803]  The president specifically criticized Twitter for blacklisted conservatives on their platform.
[01:13:05.803 --> 01:13:06.063]  Good!
[01:13:06.644 --> 01:13:09.847]  It's like throwing somebody overboard and saying, sorry, you're drowning.
[01:13:09.847 --> 01:13:19.417]  When asked by Breitbart News reporter, Charlie Spearing, about how he planned to fight tech bias in the 2020 election, he replied, you fight it by being good.
[01:13:19.417 --> 01:13:21.359]  You've got to be really good.
[01:13:21.359 --> 01:13:26.184]  It's much harder for conservative Republicans to win than it is for liberal Democrats.
[01:13:26.988 --> 01:13:32.871]  There's no indication he would use the power vested in him to demand an antitrust investigation of these blatant monopolies.
[01:13:32.871 --> 01:13:37.853]  No indication he would sign an executive order on social media censorship, which he floated last year.
[01:13:37.853 --> 01:13:45.497]  No indication he would use discrimination laws to go after PayPal and others who are blatantly discriminating against right-wingers for their First Amendment protected political speech.
[01:13:46.637 --> 01:13:46.797]  Yeah.
[01:14:01.547 --> 01:14:01.827]  We're good.
[01:14:16.963 --> 01:14:17.983]  Let's listen to Don Jr.
[01:14:17.983 --> 01:14:18.923]  and other patriots.
[01:14:18.923 --> 01:14:20.184]  Let's call the White House.
[01:14:20.184 --> 01:14:21.524]  Let's go to Trump events.
[01:14:21.524 --> 01:14:22.644]  Let's call talk radio.
[01:14:22.644 --> 01:14:23.564]  Let's call C-SPAN.
[01:14:23.564 --> 01:14:35.267]  Let's get this audio file that'll be posted at Infowars.com out to everybody and say, look, we've got a lot of fire under Trump's ass to get him to take action, or he's screwed, we're all screwed, the country's screwed.
[01:14:35.267 --> 01:14:37.388]  This is such a blind spot for the president.
[01:14:37.388 --> 01:14:43.969]  He's got a bunch of neocon advisors controlling him and manipulating him, and being nice is not going to get his attention.
[01:14:44.389 --> 01:14:52.956]  I've talked to a lot of folks that are very close to the president and they say the only way you get his attention is absolutely getting angry and upset and lobbying the hell out of him.
[01:14:52.956 --> 01:14:55.538]  So ladies and gentlemen, Trump doesn't understand the internet.
[01:14:55.538 --> 01:14:56.538]  He's 72 years old.
[01:14:56.538 --> 01:14:57.799]  He understands a lot of things.
[01:14:57.799 --> 01:14:59.500]  He doesn't get what's happening.
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:00.882]  He doesn't understand.
[01:15:00.882 --> 01:15:02.663]  He still thinks, well, there's some misbehavior.
[01:15:02.663 --> 01:15:03.904]  That's what we're being taken down.
[01:15:03.904 --> 01:15:06.165]  No, we have the internal documents.
[01:15:06.165 --> 01:15:10.068]  Google said it's to stop Republicans getting elected in the future.
[01:15:10.068 --> 01:15:11.289]  Jim Jordan gets it.
[01:15:11.289 --> 01:15:12.030]  Nunes gets it.
[01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:15.233]  A few others get it.
[01:15:15.233 --> 01:15:18.336]  The Texas Congressman, Gowdy, gets it.
[01:15:18.336 --> 01:15:22.520]  Trump doesn't get it and it's time to make damn sure he does.
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:23.481]  Period.
[01:15:23.481 --> 01:15:28.205]  Trump is throwing us overboard, he's throwing himself overboard, and we cannot put up with this garbage.
[01:15:28.205 --> 01:15:29.347]  But regardless of what he does,
[01:15:29.847 --> 01:15:31.708]  We're going to continue to file lawsuits.
[01:15:31.708 --> 01:15:33.289]  You're going to continue to spread the articles and the videos.
[01:15:33.289 --> 01:15:35.810]  We're going to continue to march forward against this garbage.
[01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:37.470]  One way or another, we're going to win.
[01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:40.332]  And nationalism and patriots are being elected all over the world.
[01:15:40.332 --> 01:15:43.993]  And nothing is going to stop the march of human enlightenment and the new renaissance.
[01:15:43.993 --> 01:15:44.774]  God bless you all.
[01:15:57.658 --> 01:15:58.919]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.919 --> 01:16:00.199]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.199 --> 01:16:03.940]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:05.020]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:06.861]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.861 --> 01:16:08.561]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:38.688 --> 01:16:40.990]  The one that Americans fought and died for.
[01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:43.792]  The one symbol that represents our Constitution.

[01:17:27.262 --> 01:17:28.483]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:28.483 --> 01:17:32.406]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.406 --> 01:17:33.947]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:33.947 --> 01:17:36.909]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:36.909 --> 01:17:42.474]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:42.474 --> 01:17:43.674]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:43.674 --> 01:17:46.617]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:46.617 --> 01:17:48.838]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:53.282]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:17:53.282 --> 01:17:55.563]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.722]  I've got some really good news, though.
[01:18:00.722 --> 01:18:02.084]  X2's back.
[01:18:02.084 --> 01:18:03.845]  The original X2.
[01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:06.768]  Deep Earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[01:18:06.768 --> 01:18:07.869]  What you want.
[01:18:07.869 --> 01:18:08.970]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:08.970 --> 01:18:10.411]  It'll be here in a week.
[01:18:10.411 --> 01:18:11.972]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[01:18:11.972 --> 01:18:12.933]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:12.933 --> 01:18:14.735]  With the best iodine in the world.
[01:18:14.735 --> 01:18:15.876]  X2, it's available.
[01:18:15.876 --> 01:18:16.877]  I thought X3's great.
[01:18:16.877 --> 01:18:19.079]  We still got another Deep Earth crystal source.
[01:18:19.079 --> 01:18:20.880]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:21.801]  The scientists that do that.
[01:18:21.801 --> 01:18:24.043]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[01:18:24.864 --> 01:18:29.245]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[01:18:29.245 --> 01:18:33.326]  We now have X2 again, and in fullwarestore.com, so hallelujah!
[01:18:33.326 --> 01:18:45.030]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:53.632]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,

[01:20:00.871 --> 01:20:03.533]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.179 --> 01:20:27.083]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:20:27.083 --> 01:20:29.165]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:29.165 --> 01:20:32.027]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:20:32.027 --> 01:20:40.434]  You know, I kind of feel like a boxer right now that just took a cheap shot before the bell.
[01:20:41.977 --> 01:20:52.476]  And I'm just kind of staggered right now kind of fumbling around the ring just trying to find the ropes because I got all this news I want to cover I've got all this analysis and it's just like
[01:20:54.454 --> 01:21:00.637]  I've got Senator Blumenthal saying that Paul Manafort's sentence was light and that's a miscarriage of justice.
[01:21:00.637 --> 01:21:03.339]  I mean, literally the exact opposite is true.
[01:21:03.339 --> 01:21:11.484]  The case against Paul Manafort was already determined by a judge to not need jail time years ago.
[01:21:11.484 --> 01:21:15.346]  He was involved in all these Ukrainian deals with Tony Podesta.
[01:21:15.346 --> 01:21:17.607]  Tony Podesta gets absolutely nothing.
[01:21:17.607 --> 01:21:19.188]  His name is in no headlines.
[01:21:19.188 --> 01:21:20.589]  By the way, the judge that
[01:21:21.329 --> 01:21:27.010]  Just ruled in the Manafort case, I believe it's Jackson, the Obama appointee, said there's no Russian collusion!
[01:21:27.010 --> 01:21:29.971]  And it has nothing to do with Russian collusion!
[01:21:29.971 --> 01:21:34.572]  But it has everything to do with Russian collusion, doesn't it?
[01:21:34.572 --> 01:21:36.973]  Even though there was none.
[01:21:36.973 --> 01:21:42.354]  And so we just... We just allow that to happen.
[01:21:42.354 --> 01:21:44.374]  Like a gut blow, it's like a low blow.
[01:21:44.374 --> 01:21:47.015]  And so you're like, whoa, and then you're trying to catch your breath.
[01:21:48.632 --> 01:21:54.297]  From the unbelievable miscarriage of justice, and then the Democrats say, oh, it was a miscarriage of justice the other way around!
[01:21:54.297 --> 01:22:01.063]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton walks totally free, Jeffrey Epstein walks totally free.
[01:22:01.063 --> 01:22:09.670]  Then, you have Elizabeth Warren saying she has no sympathy for those who frauded the colleges.
[01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:11.992]  Elizabeth, you did that!
[01:22:11.992 --> 01:22:15.235]  I mean, that's just ridiculous!
[01:22:17.415 --> 01:22:25.160]  And then, I mean, just so much news, but again, it's just like, I'm just like fumbling, looking for the ropes, like, whoa, what the hell's happening?
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:29.023]  We just keep getting hit with all these lies and all these, this tyranny.
[01:22:29.023 --> 01:22:30.164]  So, but here's what I'm going to do.
[01:22:30.164 --> 01:22:32.445]  I'm going to open up the phone lines for the remainder of this hour.
[01:22:32.445 --> 01:22:32.505]  877-789-2539.
[01:22:32.505 --> 01:22:33.746]  877-789-Alex.
[01:22:33.746 --> 01:22:36.008]  What does President Trump have to do to keep America great?
[01:22:46.124 --> 01:22:48.306]  He tweeted that out this morning.
[01:22:48.306 --> 01:22:50.287]  That's his new campaign slogan.
[01:22:50.287 --> 01:22:52.749]  That's his new hat.
[01:22:52.749 --> 01:22:56.872]  What does President Trump have to do to keep America great?
[01:22:56.872 --> 01:22:59.213]  Now I know that there's a litany of things.
[01:22:59.213 --> 01:23:01.114]  I just want one.
[01:23:01.114 --> 01:23:03.976]  And so we're just going to plow through a ton of calls.
[01:23:03.976 --> 01:23:07.319]  I want 60 second responses.
[01:23:10.698 --> 01:23:14.160]  What does President Trump need to do to keep America great?
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.321]  Arrest Peter Stroke?
[01:23:16.321 --> 01:23:18.402]  Arrest Andrew McCabe?
[01:23:18.402 --> 01:23:20.603]  Because they're back in the news today.
[01:23:20.603 --> 01:23:25.745]  The Lisa Page transcripts make the Obama Department look exactly like it was.
[01:23:25.745 --> 01:23:27.025]  A broken and corrupt machine.
[01:23:27.025 --> 01:23:28.706]  Hopefully justice will finally be served.
[01:23:28.706 --> 01:23:29.667]  Much more to come.
[01:23:29.667 --> 01:23:32.968]  That's from President Trump!
[01:23:32.968 --> 01:23:37.370]  You're the President of the United States of America!
[01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:38.891]  Do something about it!
[01:23:39.974 --> 01:23:40.454]  Excuse me.
[01:23:40.454 --> 01:23:42.435]  This is what happens at this big news studio.
[01:23:42.435 --> 01:23:44.455]  I tend to yell louder.
[01:23:44.455 --> 01:23:45.715]  President Trump again.
[01:23:45.715 --> 01:23:49.976]  James Comey testified under oath that it was a unanimous decision on Crooked Hillary.
[01:23:49.976 --> 01:23:52.337]  Lisa Page transcript showed he lied.
[01:23:52.337 --> 01:23:55.577]  That's perjury, President Trump!
[01:23:55.577 --> 01:24:00.758]  Do something about it!
[01:24:00.758 --> 01:24:02.219]  Nice tweets though.
[01:24:02.219 --> 01:24:03.539]  Nice tweets, Mr. President.
[01:24:04.565 --> 01:24:07.648]  Really great, really great tweets, Mr. President.
[01:24:07.648 --> 01:24:14.334]  By the way, you know some of us aren't allowed on Twitter, Mr. President, but you say just behave.
[01:24:14.334 --> 01:24:17.457]  Your friend Paul Manafort just got seven and a half years in jail.
[01:24:17.457 --> 01:24:19.419]  The Democrats do the exact same bullcrap.
[01:24:19.419 --> 01:24:20.359]  They get immunity.
[01:24:20.359 --> 01:24:25.104]  Your friend Roger Stone is about to get put in jail, too, for literally nothing.
[01:24:36.818 --> 01:24:39.140]  What does President Trump need to do to keep America great?
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.181]  We're taking your phone calls.
[01:24:40.181 --> 01:24:42.002]  I need just a 60 second response.
[01:24:42.002 --> 01:24:42.843]  Let's get at it now.
[01:24:42.843 --> 01:24:45.965]  We've got Liberty calling in from Oklahoma.
[01:24:45.965 --> 01:24:50.809]  What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[01:24:50.809 --> 01:24:53.651]  I'm just as pissed off and discouraged as you.
[01:24:53.651 --> 01:25:01.097]  The number one thing he has to do and what he promised to do was jail these traitors, these deep state traitors.
[01:25:01.097 --> 01:25:02.898]  We all know who they are.
[01:25:02.898 --> 01:25:04.880]  And the number two thing is he has to
[01:25:05.427 --> 01:25:08.550]  Follow through on this censorship and stop it right now.
[01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:11.613]  It's got to be made clear to him.
[01:25:11.613 --> 01:25:12.794]  I'm so ticked off.
[01:25:12.794 --> 01:25:14.035]  You've talked to me before.
[01:25:14.035 --> 01:25:15.656]  You know who I am.
[01:25:15.656 --> 01:25:20.681]  So I'm so ticked off at this, and I'm a peace-loving American.
[01:25:20.681 --> 01:25:22.262]  But this is enough's enough.
[01:25:22.262 --> 01:25:26.185]  If not, you know what it's going to turn into, and it won't be pretty.
[01:25:26.185 --> 01:25:26.666]  What do you think?
[01:25:27.324 --> 01:25:35.068]  Well, I mean, it's like, how many times do I have to get politically spat in my face until I do something?
[01:25:35.068 --> 01:25:36.369]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:25:36.369 --> 01:25:37.249]  Thank you for the call, Liberty.
[01:25:37.249 --> 01:25:40.090]  I mean, again, this is from John Radcliffe.
[01:25:40.090 --> 01:25:52.837]  Lisa Page confirmed to me under oath that the FBI was ordered by the Obama Department of Justice not to consider charging Hillary Clinton for gross negligence in the handling of classified information.
[01:25:52.837 --> 01:25:52.997]  I mean,
[01:25:54.059 --> 01:25:54.979]  Hello!
[01:25:54.979 --> 01:25:56.640]  Earth to President Trump!
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.341]  Earth to anyone!
[01:25:58.341 --> 01:26:02.002]  Is there anyone alive in the United States government?
[01:26:02.002 --> 01:26:03.543]  Let's go to Dustin in Alabama.
[01:26:03.543 --> 01:26:05.904]  What does President Trump need to do to keep America great?
[01:26:05.904 --> 01:26:07.644]  Go ahead, Dustin.
[01:26:07.644 --> 01:26:09.225]  Hey Owen, can you hear me?
[01:26:09.225 --> 01:26:09.505]  Yeah.
[01:26:10.876 --> 01:26:19.219]  Hey man, I believe if he legalizes marijuana that he will absolutely get 2020.
[01:26:19.219 --> 01:26:21.460]  But hold on a second though, Dustin.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:24.881]  Just Trump winning 2020 does not keep America great.
[01:26:24.881 --> 01:26:27.182]  That is true, that is true.
[01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:35.685]  But I do think that if he were to finally crack down on all of the deep state people that I really do think that he needs to crack down on them, you know?
[01:26:38.257 --> 01:26:39.637]  Boy, I'll tell you what.
[01:26:39.637 --> 01:26:40.878]  Thanks for the call, Dustin.
[01:26:40.878 --> 01:26:42.278]  I'll tell you what.
[01:26:42.278 --> 01:26:45.599]  Q better be real, or we're so screwed.
[01:26:45.599 --> 01:26:47.379]  Ha!
[01:26:47.379 --> 01:26:48.419]  I mean, folks, we're done!
[01:26:48.419 --> 01:26:49.440]  Like, the country's done!
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.280]  Do you get it?
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:57.802]  They will arrest and put anyone in jail that they want.
[01:26:57.802 --> 01:26:59.982]  Let's go to Daryl in Texas.
[01:26:59.982 --> 01:27:02.923]  What does President Trump need to do to keep America great?
[01:27:02.923 --> 01:27:03.503]  Go ahead, Daryl.
[01:27:04.662 --> 01:27:09.206]  Trump needs to not forget where he came from, and there's two things.
[01:27:09.206 --> 01:27:11.748]  One thing, he's a scrapper.
[01:27:11.748 --> 01:27:16.151]  And then the second thing is, he needs to do what he does best.
[01:27:16.151 --> 01:27:23.337]  He needs to rely on regular people that he can bring into Washington to fight for him.
[01:27:23.337 --> 01:27:28.521]  The first thing about being a scrapper, he needs to go for their power.
[01:27:28.521 --> 01:27:31.103]  They wield all their power in the media.
[01:27:31.904 --> 01:27:46.175]  Um, that's on social media, but it's also on television and, you know, I'm not sure exactly what he can do through the FCC or through, you know, uh, going, uh... Well, that's actually a good question, Daryl, and we're going to break here.
[01:27:46.175 --> 01:27:47.676]  We're going to continue to take your calls.
[01:27:47.676 --> 01:27:49.098]  Here's the thing.
[01:27:49.098 --> 01:27:56.263]  Obviously, the President can't do anything about the censorship or, let's say, Facebook and Twitter.
[01:27:56.263 --> 01:27:57.204]  I mean, they're allowed to censor.
[01:27:57.204 --> 01:27:59.646]  It's part of their free speech, but you're telling me
[01:28:00.569 --> 01:28:05.391]  If you don't launch an investigation into those companies, you're not going to find something, folks.
[01:28:05.391 --> 01:28:10.773]  I mean, can you imagine if you sent a Mueller-type probe after Zuckerberg or Dorsey?
[01:28:10.773 --> 01:28:12.413]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:28:12.413 --> 01:28:14.474]  See, but that's the thing.
[01:28:14.474 --> 01:28:20.657]  Republicans and conservatives aren't a bunch of corrupt dicks that just want to ruin people's lives for their politics.
[01:28:20.657 --> 01:28:22.277]  Excuse my French, but it's true!
[01:28:22.277 --> 01:28:23.217]  That's all these people are.
[01:28:23.217 --> 01:28:24.538]  Robert Mueller, Adam Schiff.
[01:28:24.538 --> 01:28:27.579]  I mean, at least they're a bunch of jerks.
[01:28:27.579 --> 01:28:29.620]  I mean, who knows what really goes on with these people.
[01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:34.158]  But, that's the problem.
[01:28:34.158 --> 01:28:38.522]  And so yeah, we just sit here and just take it.
[01:28:38.522 --> 01:28:47.670]  But I guarantee you, if we launch an investigation, I mean, Facebook and Google and Twitter, mainly Facebook and Google, they've been fined out the wazoo!
[01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:50.152]  They've already had record fines in Europe!
[01:28:50.152 --> 01:28:52.754]  Do an investigation into those companies!

[01:28:58.686 --> 01:29:02.607]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.

[01:33:22.295 --> 01:33:24.557]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:24.557 --> 01:33:27.879]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:27.879 --> 01:33:30.901]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:32.935 --> 01:33:34.698]  This country is totally out of control.
[01:33:34.698 --> 01:33:38.024]  And it's only getting worse.
[01:33:38.024 --> 01:33:40.208]  We're spiraling into tyranny.
[01:33:40.208 --> 01:33:43.213]  Total lack of freedom and choice.
[01:33:43.213 --> 01:33:45.938]  And you know, we thought we elected the president to do something about it.
[01:33:47.782 --> 01:33:59.509]  You know, I was trying to explain to people last week how they're about, really it was three weeks ago, and then it happened last week, and then it's still happening, how they're pushing this forced vaccination thing, this mandatory vaccination thing hard.
[01:33:59.509 --> 01:34:04.692]  I mean, it's every damn day in mainstream news, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:04.692 --> 01:34:07.413]  Forced vaccinations is what it's all about.
[01:34:07.413 --> 01:34:08.314]  It's all about tyranny.
[01:34:08.314 --> 01:34:11.155]  It's all about control.
[01:34:11.155 --> 01:34:12.676]  It's all about you not having the choice.
[01:34:12.676 --> 01:34:15.878]  It's all about the state being your daddy, the state being your mommy.
[01:34:18.898 --> 01:34:32.475]  Look, I have a bit of the primal urges still in me and so like when I absorb this and I know what it all means, I really want to start breaking shit.
[01:34:32.475 --> 01:34:34.858]  Excuse me, dump that.
[01:34:34.858 --> 01:34:36.120]  I just need to go back to your calls.
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:36.820]  It's just, it's just...
[01:34:37.836 --> 01:34:38.876]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:34:38.876 --> 01:34:42.037]  I mean, if we don't start standing up for America, it's gone.
[01:34:42.037 --> 01:34:43.098]  It's done.
[01:34:43.098 --> 01:34:44.878]  You'll be forced to vaccinate.
[01:34:44.878 --> 01:34:46.019]  The state will take your kid.
[01:34:46.019 --> 01:34:47.019]  The state will abort it.
[01:34:47.019 --> 01:34:50.000]  They'll say, oh, it's legal.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.501]  And nobody seems to care, and we thought we elected the president to do something about it.
[01:34:53.501 --> 01:34:58.183]  I mean, I hope Q is real, folks, or you can kiss this country goodbye.
[01:34:59.204 --> 01:35:02.307]  So, what does the President have to do to keep America great?
[01:35:02.307 --> 01:35:03.608]  We are asking you today.
[01:35:03.608 --> 01:35:04.329]  Oh yeah, there's a story.
[01:35:04.329 --> 01:35:06.551]  I couldn't even get to it because I'm just so enraged.
[01:35:06.551 --> 01:35:08.533]  This is from NBC News today.
[01:35:08.533 --> 01:35:13.397]  Amazon removes books promoting autism cures and vaccine misinformation.
[01:35:13.397 --> 01:35:14.438]  Are you seeing it yet?
[01:35:14.438 --> 01:35:17.441]  Are you seeing it yet?
[01:35:17.441 --> 01:35:19.043]  Let's go to Chris in Minnesota.
[01:35:19.043 --> 01:35:23.787]  What does the President need to do to keep America great?
[01:35:23.787 --> 01:35:24.368]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:35:26.209 --> 01:35:27.971]  Owen, thank you.
[01:35:27.971 --> 01:35:30.153]  You've really nailed a couple of things today.
[01:35:30.153 --> 01:35:36.978]  Unfortunately, we're sitting here hoping that Q is real or else all hope is lost.
[01:35:36.978 --> 01:35:37.719]  We're done, man.
[01:35:37.719 --> 01:35:38.219]  We're done.
[01:35:38.219 --> 01:35:39.100]  The swap wins.
[01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.682]  It's over.
[01:35:40.682 --> 01:35:46.567]  Well, it's like I've told so many people over the last two years from the day Trump was elected.
[01:35:46.567 --> 01:35:53.793]  Either he's with those scum that have been... Either he's with them
[01:35:54.443 --> 01:36:13.397]  Well, she's a miracle man sent from God, but you hear about the, and you know, the deceptions, the massive, the multi-pronged attack on American citizens and our spirits for years is to demoralize us and everything else is
[01:36:14.821 --> 01:36:23.828]  It is supernatural, but it would take a supernatural guy or somebody blessed by God to... Well, either way, thank you for the call.
[01:36:23.828 --> 01:36:25.970]  We're doing 60 seconds.
[01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:29.753]  But, I mean, look, either way, good or bad, Trump was sent by God.
[01:36:29.753 --> 01:36:39.080]  So, I mean, he was either sent by God to be the final nail of tyranny, of deception that we all thought was going to be the hero, or again, Q is real.
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:39.541]  But I mean, look.
[01:36:40.410 --> 01:36:41.171]  It's like the same thing.
[01:36:41.171 --> 01:36:44.654]  All of these college people, they're all a bunch of liberal Democrats.
[01:36:44.654 --> 01:36:46.335]  I mean, every damn one of them, man!
[01:36:46.335 --> 01:36:47.736]  They're all Clinton donors!
[01:36:47.736 --> 01:36:49.918]  Literally!
[01:36:49.918 --> 01:36:56.884]  And it's just... But there's hope, I guess, because... I mean, I don't know.
[01:36:56.884 --> 01:36:58.426]  Maybe it's just like hope porn.
[01:36:59.915 --> 01:37:05.617]  Elite College Cheating Scandal Arrests Just the Tip of the Iceberg, according to Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz.
[01:37:05.617 --> 01:37:09.418]  Is he saying that because he knows that more is about to be exposed?
[01:37:09.418 --> 01:37:12.018]  Or is he saying that because he knows how corrupt it really is?
[01:37:12.018 --> 01:37:13.239]  Here's what needs to be done.
[01:37:13.239 --> 01:37:15.099]  See, I'm a man of action.
[01:37:15.099 --> 01:37:17.680]  If I was the President, who's a man of Twitter,
[01:37:18.937 --> 01:37:40.871]  I'd shut down every state-run university next semester, I'd shut down the entire Ivy League, I would take all of their endowment funds, I would relieve the student loan debt, and I'd launch an investigation into these state-run universities which have been caught cheating, rigging, faking classes, lying for athletes, letting athletes die, I mean, literally!
[01:37:41.431 --> 01:37:47.757]  Yeah, shut them all down, launch an investigation, take their endowment, yeah, go and steal their endowment money.
[01:37:47.757 --> 01:37:49.498]  They steal from people all day long.
[01:37:49.498 --> 01:37:50.819]  Oh, what happened?
[01:37:50.819 --> 01:37:52.701]  Oh, oh, I don't know.
[01:37:52.701 --> 01:37:53.321]  What happened is...
[01:37:55.014 --> 01:38:03.581]  They decided they were going to start all these new student loan programs, so now everybody can go to college because that's what you need, and then guess what the universities did?
[01:38:03.581 --> 01:38:12.488]  They jacked up their enrollment costs and their tuitions double, triple, quadruple!
[01:38:12.488 --> 01:38:13.909]  It's all a big racket!
[01:38:13.909 --> 01:38:15.190]  It's all a big game!
[01:38:15.190 --> 01:38:20.554]  So I don't know if Durchman's just saying, hey, more's coming, be patient, or yeah, the whole system is effed.
[01:38:23.052 --> 01:38:25.714]  What does President Trump need to do to keep America great?
[01:38:25.714 --> 01:38:29.037]  David in New York, go ahead.
[01:38:29.037 --> 01:38:30.198]  Good afternoon, Owen.
[01:38:30.198 --> 01:38:34.322]  This is what he needs to do to follow up on the two points you guys just mentioned.
[01:38:34.322 --> 01:38:36.083]  First of all, the God factor.
[01:38:36.083 --> 01:38:48.114]  We need to make it a fair playing field, Owen, with the Christian-Judeo culture that we were rooted in versus the Muslims that are coming in here with their propaganda, their free speech, shaming us, shouting us down.
[01:38:48.587 --> 01:39:01.137]  President Trump needs to break out one of them golden pens and sign, unfortunately, another executive order saying no more toleration against any speech that comes against the Christian thought or even the Muslim.
[01:39:01.137 --> 01:39:02.878]  Put us in a fair fighting ring.
[01:39:02.878 --> 01:39:04.500]  I'll take the Muslim on verbally.
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:05.841]  I'll take their ideology on.
[01:39:05.841 --> 01:39:07.082]  I know where they come from.
[01:39:07.082 --> 01:39:08.203]  I know their history.
[01:39:08.203 --> 01:39:11.525]  I'll argue with them in a polite but yet firm manner.
[01:39:11.525 --> 01:39:12.766]  But take our
[01:39:14.093 --> 01:39:16.956]  Freedom of speech away Oman and we lost, we're done.
[01:39:16.956 --> 01:39:23.404]  He needs to sign that executive order and fine, shut down like you just did, shut down any operation and jail him!
[01:39:23.908 --> 01:39:25.429]  Taking our free speech.
[01:39:25.429 --> 01:39:26.510]  Jail them turkeys!
[01:39:54.389 --> 01:39:54.950]  Okay?
[01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:59.254]  We're the ones that got told radical Islam wants to kill us all.
[01:39:59.254 --> 01:40:02.557]  They were responsible for the biggest terror attack in this country's history.
[01:40:02.557 --> 01:40:05.280]  So what am I supposed to believe?
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:12.687]  But it's like... I had somebody send me a video, and again, it's like, is it a problem?
[01:40:12.687 --> 01:40:12.987]  Is it not?
[01:40:12.987 --> 01:40:14.428]  We're not even having the intellectual debate.
[01:40:15.202 --> 01:40:18.785]  Muslims are starting to take over our political system.
[01:40:18.785 --> 01:40:20.547]  They just did a care ceremony.
[01:40:20.547 --> 01:40:21.287]  Somebody just sent it to me.
[01:40:21.287 --> 01:40:29.754]  They're like, yeah, well, six years ago we had 10 Muslims run for office and overall raised $6 million.
[01:40:29.754 --> 01:40:33.518]  This last election we had 270 Muslims running for office.
[01:40:33.518 --> 01:40:34.959]  We got over 100 of them in.
[01:40:34.959 --> 01:40:37.081]  We raised tens of millions of dollars.
[01:40:37.081 --> 01:40:39.303]  So I mean, this is a trend, folks.
[01:40:39.303 --> 01:40:39.623]  And again, OK.
[01:40:41.124 --> 01:40:46.906]  We're told radical Islam is responsible for the biggest terror attack in this country's history.
[01:40:46.906 --> 01:40:47.807]  Never forget, right?
[01:40:47.807 --> 01:40:49.187]  Hashtag never forget.
[01:40:49.187 --> 01:40:50.508]  Well, are we forgetting?
[01:40:50.508 --> 01:40:52.549]  Or what the hell's going on here?
[01:40:52.549 --> 01:40:55.770]  Jeff, in Canada.
[01:40:55.770 --> 01:40:58.751]  I normally wouldn't be taking calls from Canada, but you snuck in, Jeff.
[01:40:58.751 --> 01:41:02.193]  What does Trump need to do to keep America great?
[01:41:02.193 --> 01:41:06.074]  Oh, and there's a great biblical analogy here of David and Goliath.
[01:41:06.074 --> 01:41:07.175]  What Trump needs to do
[01:41:08.028 --> 01:41:16.897]  Um, in light of the scenario, what happened, where there's two armies facing off, and there's a giant that's been mocking and mocking for days.
[01:41:16.897 --> 01:41:21.742]  He gets the word of the Lord, goes out, and he cuts the giant's head off.
[01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:25.646]  That's what Trump needs to do politically, is cut the giant's head off.
[01:41:25.646 --> 01:41:28.849]  Everybody else turns tail and run, and that sparks and motivates the army.
[01:41:28.849 --> 01:41:31.532]  Yeah, but Jeff, that means someone has to go to jail.
[01:41:33.021 --> 01:41:34.422]  Clinton needs to go to jail.
[01:41:34.422 --> 01:41:35.883]  Obama needs to go to jail.
[01:41:35.883 --> 01:41:37.204]  Comey needs to go to jail.
[01:41:37.204 --> 01:41:37.945]  Brennan.
[01:41:37.945 --> 01:41:38.806]  Clapper.
[01:41:38.806 --> 01:41:39.747]  McCabe.
[01:41:39.747 --> 01:41:40.587]  Stroke.
[01:41:40.587 --> 01:41:43.009]  We have the list.
[01:41:43.009 --> 01:41:48.314]  Took out the champion, and when the champion's taken out, everybody else is filled with fear on the other side.
[01:41:48.314 --> 01:41:51.236]  He needs to go after the top brass.
[01:41:51.236 --> 01:41:53.198]  Do they look like they're filled with fear, Jeff?
[01:41:53.198 --> 01:41:55.520]  They just put Manafort for seven and a half.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:56.821]  They're trying to get Stone.
[01:41:56.821 --> 01:41:57.942]  Epstein walks free.
[01:41:57.942 --> 01:41:59.163]  Podesta walks free.
[01:41:59.163 --> 01:42:00.243]  Clinton walks free.
[01:42:00.243 --> 01:42:00.964]  Comey walks free.
[01:42:00.964 --> 01:42:01.965]  Do they seem like they're in fear?
[01:42:02.833 --> 01:42:05.194]  They're not in fear because Trump's not taking off the head.
[01:42:05.194 --> 01:42:11.677]  He needs to take off the head leadership that is doing the mocking, and to me there's no hope.
[01:42:11.677 --> 01:42:13.878]  If he doesn't do that, he's done.
[01:42:13.878 --> 01:42:15.859]  Here's another thing, too, to go back to the last caller.
[01:42:15.859 --> 01:42:16.819]  Thanks, Jeff.
[01:42:16.819 --> 01:42:30.585]  Because you have to understand that the enemy of the United States of America, the enemy of humanity, will do anything to try to destroy freedom and the free market in the West, and including introducing Islam into the West.
[01:42:30.585 --> 01:42:31.646]  And so that's what they're doing.
[01:42:33.084 --> 01:42:34.184]  That's really what it's about.
[01:42:34.184 --> 01:42:42.968]  It's about introducing Islam in the West, starting all this infighting, starting all this having the whole Jew versus Muslim now in the West too, so we'll have to deal with that.
[01:42:42.968 --> 01:42:46.990]  It's all about destroying freedom and free markets in the West.
[01:42:46.990 --> 01:42:47.810]  That's what it's all about.
[01:42:47.810 --> 01:42:51.691]  I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm not anti-Islam, I'm pro-freedom in the West.
[01:42:51.691 --> 01:42:53.932]  I'm anti-destroy freedom in the West.
[01:42:53.932 --> 01:42:55.633]  And that's what they're doing on every front.
[01:42:57.435 --> 01:43:00.677]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[01:43:00.677 --> 01:43:03.699]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[01:43:03.699 --> 01:43:10.562]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[01:43:10.562 --> 01:43:11.843]  X2 is back.
[01:43:11.843 --> 01:43:12.483]  You got it?
[01:43:12.483 --> 01:43:14.164]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[01:43:14.164 --> 01:43:15.765]  We rushed it into production.
[01:43:15.765 --> 01:43:16.526]  It's been bottled.
[01:43:16.526 --> 01:43:18.527]  The labels are being put on today.
[01:43:18.527 --> 01:43:22.289]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the
[01:43:22.509 --> 01:43:22.669]  Yeah.
[01:43:39.779 --> 01:43:43.903]  The good halogens, you have the bad halogens at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:43.903 --> 01:43:45.144]  That's the umbrella site.
[01:43:45.144 --> 01:43:46.366]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:43:46.366 --> 01:43:47.927]  Takes you right to the supplements.
[01:43:47.927 --> 01:43:51.090]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:51.090 --> 01:43:53.012]  It is X2 Original.
[01:43:53.012 --> 01:43:55.354]  Now back at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:57.008 --> 01:44:02.432]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[01:44:02.432 --> 01:44:04.233]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[01:44:04.233 --> 01:44:05.994]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[01:44:05.994 --> 01:44:07.815]  Now, I can make them strong.
[01:44:07.815 --> 01:44:09.476]  Now, I can instruct them.
[01:44:09.476 --> 01:44:11.197]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[01:44:11.197 --> 01:44:12.178]  But not once I'm gone.
[01:44:12.298 --> 01:44:17.421]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:44:17.421 --> 01:44:23.025]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:44:23.025 --> 01:44:26.668]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:44:26.668 --> 01:44:31.631]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[01:44:31.631 --> 01:44:38.536]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[01:44:38.536 --> 01:44:42.198]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[01:44:42.298 --> 01:44:49.909]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:44:49.909 --> 01:44:56.518]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.

[01:45:03.542 --> 01:45:12.129]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:45:12.129 --> 01:45:15.091]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:45:15.091 --> 01:45:16.853]  How can I solve that problem?

[01:45:37.405 --> 01:45:41.387]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:45:41.387 --> 01:45:43.207]  I've got two in my home.
[01:45:43.207 --> 01:45:49.310]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:50.151]  Don't live

[01:47:01.358 --> 01:47:10.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:15.862]  I asked Bobby Dylan.
[01:47:15.862 --> 01:47:17.682]  I asked the Beatles.
[01:47:17.682 --> 01:47:20.043]  I asked Timothy Leary.
[01:47:20.043 --> 01:47:22.664]  But he couldn't help me.
[01:47:22.664 --> 01:47:23.724]  I'm the Seeker.
[01:47:23.724 --> 01:47:26.745]  They call me the Seeker.
[01:47:26.745 --> 01:47:27.205]  Seeking...
[01:47:28.459 --> 01:47:29.761]  A brave president.
[01:47:29.761 --> 01:47:31.983]  A man re-elected to drain the swamp.
[01:47:31.983 --> 01:47:33.485]  We're seeking results.
[01:47:33.485 --> 01:47:35.367]  We're seeking them now.
[01:47:35.367 --> 01:47:37.409]  We're taking your calls.
[01:47:37.409 --> 01:47:42.475]  What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[01:47:42.475 --> 01:47:43.936]  I'm giving you 60 seconds.
[01:47:43.936 --> 01:47:45.598]  Let's go to David in Florida.
[01:47:45.598 --> 01:47:46.980]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:47.721]  Go ahead, David.
[01:47:48.618 --> 01:47:49.819]  Thank you so much, Owen.
[01:47:49.819 --> 01:47:54.163]  I just wanted to mention Founding Father John Jay and how brilliant he actually was.
[01:47:54.163 --> 01:48:02.530]  He was the, if I recall correctly, the first Chief Justice of the New York Supreme Court while he served as President pre-Constitution.
[01:48:02.530 --> 01:48:07.414]  For Trump to make America great, he can condense the intelligence agencies because there's way too many of them.
[01:48:07.414 --> 01:48:10.337]  They infight, they suck off the country's money.
[01:48:10.337 --> 01:48:11.358]  They lie us into war.
[01:48:11.989 --> 01:48:12.930]  They lie us into war.
[01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:14.090]  They do tons of stuff.
[01:48:14.090 --> 01:48:22.136]  So you basically make one intelligence agency, and instead of firing all the good people that work there, you go back to John Day.
[01:48:22.136 --> 01:48:27.379]  He was originally head of the New York Committee to Detect and Defeat Conspiracies.
[01:48:27.379 --> 01:48:33.623]  The Founding Fathers knew that conspiracies were the main threat to this country.
[01:48:33.623 --> 01:48:35.784]  A department like that, go after it.
[01:48:35.784 --> 01:48:36.865]  Actually put them in jail.
[01:48:37.901 --> 01:48:49.389]  Well, and he has at least members of Congress that are willing to go with him in this fight, but I think that the Justice Department is where he's lacking in soldiers, if you will.
[01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:50.390]  Thanks for the call, David.
[01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:51.971]  Let's go to Ed in Maryland.
[01:48:51.971 --> 01:48:56.955]  What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[01:48:56.955 --> 01:48:58.896]  Hey Owen, great to talk to you again, brother.
[01:48:58.896 --> 01:49:01.819]  Build the wall, deport them all.
[01:49:01.819 --> 01:49:05.161]  Just like a lot of you, I was disgusted by the CPAC speech.
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:12.944]  If our disease is that we're hemorrhaging jobs, then we don't need to be importing people here.
[01:49:12.944 --> 01:49:14.125]  We don't need them.
[01:49:14.125 --> 01:49:15.666]  I'm sorry to say.
[01:49:15.666 --> 01:49:25.374]  Well, look- We can figure something out for the ones who are still here, but this H- H-1B or whatever the heck they're called, visas, uh, we don't need them.
[01:49:25.374 --> 01:49:35.061]  All I see here in Maryland, I see we're importing a bunch of people to work at hotels and, uh, to do landscaping and construction.
[01:49:35.061 --> 01:49:35.261]  Well,
[01:49:36.195 --> 01:49:42.857]  Illegal immigration is the problem here.
[01:49:42.857 --> 01:49:46.899]  And it's more than 20 million people are here illegally.
[01:49:46.899 --> 01:49:49.339]  They suck up our system.
[01:49:49.339 --> 01:49:51.860]  They corrupt our system.
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:56.882]  And it's so bad, they won't even allow you to put on a 2020 census, are you a citizen or not?
[01:49:56.882 --> 01:50:01.083]  I mean, what the hell is that?
[01:50:01.083 --> 01:50:03.904]  So, look, I actually am in agreement with you.
[01:50:03.904 --> 01:50:05.145]  I'd shut immigration down
[01:50:06.069 --> 01:50:06.590]  We're good to go.
[01:50:24.875 --> 01:50:26.737]  But we're not even, like, trying to solve the problem.
[01:50:26.737 --> 01:50:28.718]  You've got 20 million people here illegally.
[01:50:28.718 --> 01:50:31.821]  They continue to cross the border illegally every day.
[01:50:31.821 --> 01:50:35.664]  And we're just kind of, like, spinning our heads, like, oh, what are we doing?
[01:50:35.664 --> 01:50:36.565]  It's happening.
[01:50:36.565 --> 01:50:39.448]  I mean, look at these stories I got here today.
[01:50:39.448 --> 01:50:44.312]  I mean, I could do stacks of these every day.
[01:50:44.312 --> 01:50:46.674]  Man accused of sexual assault is illegal immigrant.
[01:50:46.674 --> 01:50:50.657]  I mean, these stories literally happen every day.
[01:50:50.657 --> 01:50:52.079]  But how about this?
[01:50:53.012 --> 01:50:59.317]  Yuma Sector Border Patrol apprehends nearly 750 illegal aliens over the weekend.
[01:50:59.317 --> 01:51:00.078]  In one weekend.
[01:51:00.078 --> 01:51:01.179]  At one stop.
[01:51:01.179 --> 01:51:01.879]  750.
[01:51:01.879 --> 01:51:08.745]  Rio Grande Valley Sector apprehends nearly 7,000 illegal aliens in one week.
[01:51:08.745 --> 01:51:11.707]  Support for Donald Trump dwindles among ICE officers.
[01:51:11.707 --> 01:51:13.669]  Yeah, because it keeps getting worse.
[01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:17.612]  The illegal immigration issue keeps getting worse under the president that said he would stop it!
[01:51:18.769 --> 01:51:22.794]  So yeah, if you come across the border illegally, we're sorry.
[01:51:22.794 --> 01:51:24.035]  We're sorry you're sick.
[01:51:24.035 --> 01:51:25.677]  We're sorry your country sucks.
[01:51:25.677 --> 01:51:26.839]  We're sorry you're pregnant.
[01:51:26.839 --> 01:51:28.301]  We're sorry you got two kids.
[01:51:28.301 --> 01:51:30.603]  We're sorry some Mexican raped them on the way up here.
[01:51:30.603 --> 01:51:34.308]  It's not our problem!
[01:51:34.308 --> 01:51:38.293]  Chris, in Georgia, what does the president need to do to keep America great?
[01:51:39.898 --> 01:51:42.039]  What do all these people have in common?
[01:51:42.039 --> 01:51:43.420]  They're all satanic.
[01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:45.721]  They're all part of the Church of Satan.
[01:51:45.721 --> 01:51:51.624]  They need to declare it a terrorist organization, let them stop terrorizing us, killing babies.
[01:51:51.624 --> 01:51:54.685]  What happened to Trump telling Alex, I'll never let you down.
[01:51:54.685 --> 01:51:56.146]  And look what he's doing now.
[01:51:56.146 --> 01:51:57.467]  He's letting America down.
[01:51:57.467 --> 01:51:59.168]  He's letting free speech down.
[01:51:59.168 --> 01:52:01.008]  I mean, that's the core of our values right there.
[01:52:01.008 --> 01:52:03.950]  Anything else?
[01:52:05.734 --> 01:52:06.755]  No, that's it.
[01:52:06.755 --> 01:52:16.005]  I thought you made a great point earlier, though, about him saying, just be good, and look at him during the campaign trail, you know, how did that work for him?
[01:52:16.005 --> 01:52:16.625]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:52:16.625 --> 01:52:19.468]  Remember, they told you, President Trump, just be good.
[01:52:19.468 --> 01:52:21.250]  Just toe the line, President Trump.
[01:52:21.250 --> 01:52:23.032]  We won't be so mean to you.
[01:52:23.032 --> 01:52:25.654]  Maybe we'll let you win the nomination, and he didn't do it and he won.
[01:52:25.654 --> 01:52:26.215]  Exactly.
[01:52:26.215 --> 01:52:27.276]  Thank you for the call, Chris.
[01:52:27.276 --> 01:52:28.918]  And you know, I got other people sending me messages.
[01:52:30.964 --> 01:52:36.205]  President Trump needs to go after Big Pharma at a really root level.
[01:52:36.205 --> 01:52:38.826]  Go after the vaccine makers.
[01:52:38.826 --> 01:52:43.206]  Billions of dollars of settled cases from vaccine damage.
[01:52:43.206 --> 01:52:45.347]  Go after the eugenics program.
[01:52:45.347 --> 01:52:46.967]  Go after the population control.
[01:52:46.967 --> 01:52:48.348]  Blow that up.
[01:52:48.348 --> 01:52:50.088]  That'll wake some people up.
[01:52:50.088 --> 01:52:52.848]  Alright, let's go to Charlie in New York.
[01:52:52.848 --> 01:52:55.269]  What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[01:52:56.633 --> 01:52:59.074]  Hi Owen, thanks for taking me.
[01:52:59.074 --> 01:53:02.696]  I'm just as angry and frustrated as you.
[01:53:02.696 --> 01:53:06.517]  I'll try and cram this in as fast as I can in 60 seconds.
[01:53:06.517 --> 01:53:07.598]  It's against the money.
[01:53:07.598 --> 01:53:10.719]  The first thing you've got to do is get rid of George Soros.
[01:53:10.719 --> 01:53:12.159]  Throw him out of the country.
[01:53:12.159 --> 01:53:17.042]  Without the money, people are going to lose their funding for battle.
[01:53:17.042 --> 01:53:20.023]  The second thing you've got to do is toss out the UN.
[01:53:20.023 --> 01:53:21.904]  Set them up in Germany or get rid of them.
[01:53:21.904 --> 01:53:22.824]  They're nothing for us.
[01:53:23.226 --> 01:53:29.169]  The third thing he's got to do is round up all the obvious criminals from the Obama administration.
[01:53:29.169 --> 01:53:30.630]  We all know who they are.
[01:53:30.630 --> 01:53:31.990]  We know all the crimes.
[01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:33.411]  We've got all the evidence.
[01:53:33.411 --> 01:53:35.492]  Put them in the military tribunal.
[01:53:35.492 --> 01:53:37.193]  Get mowers open.
[01:53:37.193 --> 01:53:41.715]  The next thing he's got to do is go ahead and build that wall and keep all these
[01:53:42.746 --> 01:53:44.868]  Uh, sick people from coming up here.
[01:53:44.868 --> 01:53:51.992]  That's why we need the vaccines right now is because all these medieval diseases are coming back into the United States.
[01:53:51.992 --> 01:53:55.034]  But if you cut off the money, that is the head of the giant.
[01:53:55.034 --> 01:54:07.943]  Without the funding, the Democrats have got no money to put up the opposition, and they have no money to to fund these radical groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center and everybody else who's making our life miserable.
[01:54:08.402 --> 01:54:10.964]  Day-to-day, I see all these things happening.
[01:54:10.964 --> 01:54:15.286]  And the problem with the universities did not start at the universities.
[01:54:15.286 --> 01:54:20.189]  During the Obama administration, it started in the lower school, Common Core.
[01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:22.410]  There's hundreds, but hold on Charlie.
[01:54:22.410 --> 01:54:23.611]  First of all, great call.
[01:54:23.611 --> 01:54:24.291]  Thank you for the call.
[01:54:24.291 --> 01:54:28.153]  The Port Soros Military Tribunals for the Criminals Build the Wall.
[01:54:28.153 --> 01:54:29.274]  But on the college issue,
[01:54:30.191 --> 01:54:37.814]  I mean, yeah, the liberalization, the socialism that they are trying, the communism that they're trying to teach in schools, I mean, yeah, that's one thing.
[01:54:37.814 --> 01:54:44.216]  You go look at the endowment funds in the Ivy League schools, I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:54:44.216 --> 01:54:46.917]  We're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:54:46.917 --> 01:54:48.818]  Shut them all down.
[01:54:48.818 --> 01:54:53.300]  Put the endowment funds towards the student loan debt crisis.
[01:54:54.500 --> 01:55:01.886]  So you can relieve some of that, that this scandal, this big college racket stole for the future of this country, because think about it.
[01:55:01.886 --> 01:55:03.528]  What are you going to do?
[01:55:03.528 --> 01:55:06.210]  You get out of college, you've got $100,000 worth of debt, or...
[01:55:08.008 --> 01:55:13.733]  In 20 years, when every other kid has autism because of the vaccines, I mean, that's what they want!
[01:55:13.733 --> 01:55:20.039]  And then it's just game over because there are no men, there are no women, there are no anything, and post-birth abortion is real.
[01:55:20.039 --> 01:55:21.440]  I mean, that's where it's all going.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:24.403]  Yeah, there's all your endowment funds, right there.
[01:55:24.403 --> 01:55:27.326]  Shut them all down!
[01:55:27.326 --> 01:55:33.011]  Take the endowment money, relieve the student loan debt, do an investigation.
[01:55:34.716 --> 01:55:37.479]  I just wonder if there's anyone in this country that's willing to do it anymore.
[01:55:37.479 --> 01:55:38.579]  I mean, it's just pathetic.
[01:55:38.579 --> 01:55:40.381]  Let's go to Mike in Michigan.
[01:55:40.381 --> 01:55:42.423]  What does President Trump need to do to keep America great?
[01:55:42.423 --> 01:55:44.164]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:55:44.164 --> 01:55:45.005]  Oh, hey, Owen.
[01:55:45.005 --> 01:55:52.692]  I've been listening to you guys for about the last year and a half or so, but what he needs to do is get cut to the chase.
[01:55:52.692 --> 01:55:59.878]  Just take these people and, you know, the ones that committed treason and have them put to death.
[01:55:59.878 --> 01:56:00.919]  Pure, plain, and simple.
[01:56:02.222 --> 01:56:06.065]  He's got mountain loads of evidence from here to hell and back.
[01:56:06.065 --> 01:56:09.027]  Why isn't he doing anything about it?
[01:56:09.027 --> 01:56:09.548]  I don't get it.
[01:56:09.548 --> 01:56:22.598]  The only theory, again, and I'm not a Q believer, per se, it intrigues me, I mean, I'm not into hope porn, but if you are of that belief,
[01:56:24.347 --> 01:56:25.808]  And this is a legitimate thing.
[01:56:25.808 --> 01:56:27.088]  I'm not saying this because Q said.
[01:56:27.088 --> 01:56:31.029]  I'm saying it's legitimate to say, well, the country's not ready.
[01:56:31.029 --> 01:56:33.210]  You want to avoid civil unrest.
[01:56:33.210 --> 01:56:34.610]  Now, I don't think it matters.
[01:56:34.610 --> 01:56:38.591]  I don't think there's a group of Clinton supporters or Obama supporters.
[01:56:38.591 --> 01:56:44.473]  I mean, there's definitely not a group of Comey supporters, McCabe supporters, Brennan supporters that are take to the street.
[01:56:44.473 --> 01:56:47.414]  I mean, maybe Obama.
[01:56:47.414 --> 01:56:50.095]  Maybe Obama supporters take to the street if he gets arrested.
[01:56:50.095 --> 01:56:53.536]  But other than that, I don't see these people doing jack crap.
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:57:00.142]  But I understand where you could say, okay, at a philosophical level, the timing has to be right.
[01:57:00.142 --> 01:57:01.362]  The rollout has to be right.
[01:57:01.362 --> 01:57:06.864]  We don't want to incite more violence and we don't want to incite a civil war, but justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[01:57:06.864 --> 01:57:10.865]  If we don't take these people out of power, if we don't put these people in jail, it won't even matter.
[01:57:10.865 --> 01:57:14.566]  I mean, Trump, he's basically working alone, it feels like.
[01:57:14.566 --> 01:57:18.148]  So it's like, so do everything alone.
[01:57:18.148 --> 01:57:19.128]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[01:57:19.128 --> 01:57:19.408]  All right.
[01:57:21.991 --> 01:57:24.652]  We're going to take your calls for one more segment on the other side of this break.
[01:57:24.652 --> 01:57:26.072]  Then Caitlin Bennett is going to join me.
[01:57:26.072 --> 01:57:27.612]  You won't believe what happened to her.
[01:57:27.612 --> 01:57:28.532]  She went to a mall.
[01:57:28.532 --> 01:57:29.413]  She was stalked.
[01:57:29.413 --> 01:57:31.913]  A woman was following her around, taking pictures.
[01:57:31.913 --> 01:57:37.694]  And then Caitlin Bennett got kicked out of the mall for being stalked and harassed.
[01:57:37.694 --> 01:57:45.256]  Don't you just love America these days, where the radical left will kick you out of a bar, beat you up if you wear a Trump hat?
[01:57:45.256 --> 01:57:46.376]  Oh, it's so loving and tolerant.
[01:57:47.369 --> 01:57:53.574]  Wars are like 12-round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[01:57:53.574 --> 01:57:59.498]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[01:57:59.498 --> 01:58:01.099]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[01:58:01.099 --> 01:58:01.600]  We stopped her.
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:03.781]  We got a nationalist in.
[01:58:03.781 --> 01:58:05.983]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[01:58:05.983 --> 01:58:06.904]  We are winning.
[01:58:07.739 --> 01:58:13.249]  But those of us who are at the very front line of the tip of the spear are under unprecedented attack.
[01:58:13.249 --> 01:58:18.358]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[01:58:18.358 --> 01:58:19.481]  This is about who wants it most.
[01:58:20.914 --> 01:58:24.436]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors they've taken, everything.
[01:58:24.436 --> 01:58:26.378]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[01:58:26.378 --> 01:58:29.800]  I need financial support and I got products you and your family need.
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:30.901]  It's that simple.
[01:58:30.901 --> 01:58:32.341]  Thousands of great products.
[01:58:32.341 --> 01:58:38.445]  Whatever's award-winning, whatever's best-selling, what folks love, what I love, we bring it to you at InfoWorksShore.com.
[01:58:38.445 --> 01:58:46.571]  So please, go to InfoWorksShore.com today, look at all the great products, because we're in your hands, I'm in your hands, and your support is beyond critical.
[01:58:46.571 --> 01:58:46.871]  Thank you.
[01:58:57.745 --> 01:59:06.750]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:59:06.750 --> 01:59:16.836]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:59:16.836 --> 01:59:25.361]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:59:26.181 --> 01:59:27.542]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:59:27.542 --> 01:59:28.702]  You must experience it.
[01:59:28.702 --> 01:59:30.783]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:59:30.783 --> 01:59:35.704]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:59:35.704 --> 01:59:37.205]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:59:37.205 --> 01:59:38.685]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:59:38.685 --> 01:59:45.388]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:59:45.388 --> 01:59:51.370]  Turbo Force at m4slive.com.
[01:59:51.370 --> 01:59:54.031]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:12.632]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones has boarded a Boeing 737 MAX 8.
[02:00:12.632 --> 02:00:15.895]  Now, I'm no engineering expert, I'm no aviation expert, but I can read.
[02:00:26.363 --> 02:00:39.852]  And I have actually been told by people that work at, I'm not allowed to say, certain airlines, where they are now specifically looking at pilots and other such positions just by the color of their skin.
[02:00:39.852 --> 02:00:47.637]  So, you know, when you're up in the air and, you know, your plane is going down, you're asking yourself, what color is the pilot's skin?
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:50.461]  I mean, that's my response.
[02:00:50.461 --> 02:00:53.962]  I want to know what color the pilot's skin is when my plane is about to crash.
[02:00:53.962 --> 02:00:56.202]  Not, you know, how good the pilot is.
[02:00:56.202 --> 02:00:57.683]  But President Trump put this out.
[02:00:57.683 --> 02:01:01.244]  Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly.
[02:01:01.244 --> 02:01:04.265]  Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT.
[02:01:04.265 --> 02:01:06.285]  I see it all the time in many products.
[02:01:06.285 --> 02:01:11.487]  Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further when often old and simpler is far better.
[02:01:11.487 --> 02:01:14.068]  Split-second decisions, and he goes on.
[02:01:14.068 --> 02:01:17.269]  But basically the story is like, it's not even a pilot flying the plane anymore.
[02:01:17.269 --> 02:01:18.029]  It's computers.
[02:01:19.153 --> 02:01:28.717]  And it turns out, go figure, several Boeing 737 MAX 8 pilots in the United States complained about suspected safety flaw.
[02:01:28.717 --> 02:01:40.682]  Literally dozens of reports, including quote, inadequate and almost criminally insufficient, were amongst some of the complaints from pilots.
[02:01:40.682 --> 02:01:43.043]  Unconscionable that they were allowed to fly these.
[02:01:44.005 --> 02:01:46.627]  But see, again, it's all about control.
[02:01:46.627 --> 02:01:48.008]  It's all about centralization.
[02:01:48.008 --> 02:01:50.150]  It's not about the human being in control.
[02:01:50.150 --> 02:01:55.754]  It's all about the computer being in control.
[02:01:55.754 --> 02:01:57.115]  We're taking your calls.
[02:01:57.115 --> 02:02:12.727]  What must President Trump do to keep America great as Alex boards the 737 Max 8, which has been grounded in many countries and pilots have already said is criminally insufficient, almost criminally insufficient.
[02:02:13.547 --> 02:02:14.267]  So what's going to happen?
[02:02:14.267 --> 02:02:21.710]  Is another one going to fall out of the sky as we give the world over to computers and AI and end humanity?
[02:02:21.710 --> 02:02:27.652]  In the meantime, though, what must President Trump do to keep America great?
[02:02:27.652 --> 02:02:29.232]  Let's go to Bob in New York City.
[02:02:29.232 --> 02:02:30.853]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:02:30.853 --> 02:02:33.874]  Hey, how are you?
[02:02:33.874 --> 02:02:35.454]  Good, thanks for calling.
[02:02:35.454 --> 02:02:40.536]  Listen, man, he's got to go in slam dunks.
[02:02:40.536 --> 02:02:42.937]  Open up the investigation to the Clinton Foundation.
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:47.911]  $20 billion, more like it.
[02:02:47.911 --> 02:02:50.820]  And he's got to support the First Amendment.
[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:51.241]  That is it.
[02:02:52.568 --> 02:03:03.999]  You know, my thing with the Clintons is, I think that the swamp is afraid of the Clinton investigation being investigated because it's so ingrained in all swamp activity and all these D.C.
[02:03:03.999 --> 02:03:06.441]  establishmentarianisms.
[02:03:06.441 --> 02:03:15.931]  It's just like, if you've been in D.C., you probably have some corrupt nonsense in your closet, so you don't want whatever the Clintons have been doing to be exposed because you know, ultimately, it might blow back on you.
[02:03:16.451 --> 02:03:17.352]  Uh, but you're right.
[02:03:17.352 --> 02:03:26.578]  I mean, launch an investigation in the Clinton Foundation, like you did, uh, Russian collusion, and you'll have such a swath of criminal behavior, it's unbelievable.
[02:03:26.578 --> 02:03:27.079]  Thanks, Bob.
[02:03:27.079 --> 02:03:28.740]  Let's go to Philip in Indiana.
[02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:32.623]  What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[02:03:32.623 --> 02:03:37.006]  Well, we're at a point where, um, it's kind of precarious, I believe.
[02:03:37.006 --> 02:03:42.770]  Uh, the thing I'm seeing is that he needs to address Obama.
[02:03:42.770 --> 02:03:45.752]  For the crimes that they'll find that he's done.
[02:03:46.581 --> 02:03:48.062]  Yeah, I mean, we got it today.
[02:03:48.062 --> 02:03:49.863]  It was right out of Obama's mouth.
[02:03:49.863 --> 02:03:50.784]  Let Hillary Clinton go.
[02:03:50.784 --> 02:03:54.406]  Yeah.
[02:03:54.406 --> 02:04:11.558]  But the thing is, as somebody else was saying prior, the mockinghead, the Goliath, if you take out, I believe that that's what a lot of the left has hedged their bets on, is that nobody's going to mess with Obama because, if they do, they could start a race war.
[02:04:12.358 --> 02:04:12.558]  Well,
[02:04:42.947 --> 02:04:48.997]  I mean, it's literally on record, Obama said, let Hillary go.
[02:04:48.997 --> 02:04:52.983]  And then James Comey lied about it under oath.
[02:04:52.983 --> 02:04:54.285]  So yeah, what is the president waiting for?
[02:04:56.277 --> 02:04:58.779]  I've got some really good news, though.
[02:04:58.779 --> 02:05:00.140]  X2's back.
[02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:01.921]  The original X2.
[02:05:01.921 --> 02:05:04.823]  Deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[02:05:04.823 --> 02:05:05.924]  What you want.
[02:05:05.924 --> 02:05:07.044]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:07.044 --> 02:05:08.465]  It'll be here in a week.
[02:05:08.465 --> 02:05:10.026]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[02:05:10.026 --> 02:05:10.987]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:10.987 --> 02:05:12.788]  With the best iodine in the world.
[02:05:12.788 --> 02:05:13.929]  X2, it's available.
[02:05:13.929 --> 02:05:14.930]  I thought X3's great.
[02:05:14.930 --> 02:05:17.131]  We still got another deep-earth crystal source.
[02:05:17.131 --> 02:05:18.952]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[02:05:18.952 --> 02:05:19.853]  The scientists that do that.
[02:05:19.853 --> 02:05:22.114]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[02:05:22.935 --> 02:05:27.297]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[02:05:27.297 --> 02:05:31.399]  We now have X2 again, and in fullwarestore.com, so hallelujah!
[02:05:31.399 --> 02:05:43.105]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[02:05:43.105 --> 02:05:51.709]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,

[02:06:09.239 --> 02:06:12.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:16.803]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:16.803 --> 02:06:20.325]  I just remembered a realization I had last night.
[02:06:24.815 --> 02:06:32.661]  Hillary Clinton is one of the most hated people in world history.
[02:06:32.661 --> 02:06:39.767]  And even in America right now, she's one of the most hated people in America.
[02:06:39.767 --> 02:06:46.092]  And... I mean... You can see this for yourself, folks.
[02:06:46.092 --> 02:06:47.993]  The Democrats don't want her.
[02:06:47.993 --> 02:06:49.815]  The Democrat base is sick of her.
[02:06:50.768 --> 02:06:55.530]  I mean, she is truly one of the most scorned and hated people in America today.
[02:06:55.530 --> 02:06:56.890]  And imagine, she was almost the President.
[02:06:56.890 --> 02:06:59.031]  They almost forced her into office.
[02:06:59.031 --> 02:07:08.374]  Stole it from Bernie, stole a bunch of votes, had a bunch of illegal votes, and almost robbed the entire election process.
[02:07:08.374 --> 02:07:12.916]  And so, there is such an easy slam dunk.
[02:07:12.916 --> 02:07:17.558]  The ball is literally floating in midair, two inches
[02:07:18.902 --> 02:07:22.725]  Put Hillary Clinton in jail and your approval rating goes up 10 points overnight.
[02:07:22.725 --> 02:07:23.726]  Put Hillary Clinton in jail
[02:07:41.690 --> 02:07:48.452]  And the morale in this country skyrockets, and we finally have hope in something that there may be real justice.
[02:07:48.452 --> 02:07:56.854]  President, you're letting your friends, colleagues, and associates go to jail for nothing.
[02:07:56.854 --> 02:08:07.197]  And you're gonna let Hillary Clinton walk one of the most treasonous scum in this world's history?
[02:08:07.197 --> 02:08:10.558]  Unbelievable.
[02:08:10.558 --> 02:08:10.998]  Why?
[02:08:12.005 --> 02:08:17.147]  President Trump, why, President Trump, have you not put her in jail?
[02:08:17.147 --> 02:08:23.910]  Why is there no one in this country that is willing to put that bitch in jail?
[02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:26.331]  Maybe it's from the Clinton body count.
[02:08:26.331 --> 02:08:34.254]  It's just a coincidence that nearly a hundred Clinton associates are dead, suicided.
[02:08:34.254 --> 02:08:35.075]  Seth Rich,
[02:08:37.605 --> 02:08:39.346]  Barrington Weisenant?
[02:08:39.346 --> 02:08:40.707]  Shawn Lucas?
[02:08:40.707 --> 02:08:43.968]  Oh, and that was just after she lost the 2016 election.
[02:08:43.968 --> 02:08:46.970]  Those were just deaths after she lost the 2016 election.
[02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:52.052]  That was just a little bloodshed because Hillary lost, just in anger.
[02:08:52.052 --> 02:08:53.053]  Just murder!
[02:08:54.403 --> 02:08:55.604]  Oh, but that's just a coincidence.
[02:08:55.604 --> 02:08:56.385]  I'm sorry.
[02:08:56.385 --> 02:08:58.247]  The Clinton body count is fake news.
[02:08:58.247 --> 02:09:00.008]  There's nothing to see here.
[02:09:00.008 --> 02:09:01.970]  Oh, the Clintons did nothing in Haiti.
[02:09:01.970 --> 02:09:03.292]  They're totally innocent.
[02:09:03.292 --> 02:09:05.654]  Laura Silsby, there's nothing to see here.
[02:09:05.654 --> 02:09:09.518]  Hillary didn't laugh at all the bloodshed and death and murder and destruction in Libya.
[02:09:09.518 --> 02:09:11.480]  Oh, I'm so sorry, Hillary.
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:12.801]  Oh, you're the best, Hillary.
[02:09:12.801 --> 02:09:14.803]  Oh, I wish you were the president, Hillary.
[02:09:14.803 --> 02:09:18.006]  The Clinton body count's fake news.
[02:09:18.006 --> 02:09:18.707]  John Ash.
[02:09:20.319 --> 02:09:22.222]  This just goes on and on.
[02:09:22.222 --> 02:09:26.067]  Clinton, old chefs, like landscapers even.
[02:09:26.067 --> 02:09:30.012]  I mean, like anybody who had any... How about the young boys in Mena, Arkansas?
[02:09:30.012 --> 02:09:32.115]  I mean, it's just unbelievable, these people!
[02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:36.872]  Oh my, President Trump, please just... Could you at least just... You know what?
[02:09:36.872 --> 02:09:38.132]  I don't even care anymore, President Trump.
[02:09:38.132 --> 02:09:39.013]  Just... You know what?
[02:09:39.013 --> 02:09:41.274]  Just bend us over and screw us on everything else.
[02:09:41.274 --> 02:09:42.034]  Fine.
[02:09:42.034 --> 02:09:44.155]  Screw us, have an open border.
[02:09:44.155 --> 02:09:46.776]  Screw us, let social media censor.
[02:09:46.776 --> 02:09:48.657]  Screw us, let the swamp drain you.
[02:09:48.657 --> 02:09:50.258]  Just screw America, President Trump.
[02:09:50.258 --> 02:09:50.478]  Fine.
[02:09:50.478 --> 02:09:51.118]  I don't care.
[02:09:51.118 --> 02:09:52.159]  President Trump, just screw America.
[02:09:52.159 --> 02:09:53.019]  Do what you gotta do.
[02:09:53.019 --> 02:09:55.480]  Just at least put Hillary in jail, please.
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:10:00.703]  Could you at least do that?
[02:10:00.703 --> 02:10:00.783]  Ugh.
[02:10:02.591 --> 02:10:06.316]  We're asking people, what does President Trump need to do to keep America great?
[02:10:20.563 --> 02:10:25.987]  You know, I think people are forgetting it's not just what President Trump needs to do, it's what we need to do.
[02:10:25.987 --> 02:10:27.789]  We need to keep supporting him.
[02:10:27.789 --> 02:10:30.411]  He's a modern-day King David and he's surrounded.
[02:10:30.411 --> 02:10:31.552]  Surrounded with deep state.
[02:10:31.552 --> 02:10:34.294]  Yeah, but Patrick, you gotta understand something here.
[02:10:34.294 --> 02:10:35.455]  Patrick, Patrick.
[02:10:35.455 --> 02:10:38.737]  Now you gotta understand something here, my friend.
[02:10:38.737 --> 02:10:43.902]  I do so much to support this president, I've been banned off of Facebook and YouTube.
[02:10:44.844 --> 02:10:49.849]  I go out in the streets and face the hate mobs in a Trump hat to stand up for President Trump.
[02:10:49.849 --> 02:10:53.973]  I go to the Trump protests to destroy all the arguments against President Trump.
[02:10:53.973 --> 02:10:57.877]  I go on air three hours a day to stand up for President Trump in America, okay?
[02:10:58.928 --> 02:11:00.728]  So I understand where you're coming from.
[02:11:00.728 --> 02:11:06.350]  Yeah, America needs to act, but I'm sitting here acting every damn day.
[02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:07.590]  I go to city council.
[02:11:07.590 --> 02:11:08.851]  I'm organizing people.
[02:11:08.851 --> 02:11:18.033]  I'm behind the scenes helping people organize and work on other projects, and I'm doing all this crap, and I'm just waiting for the president to have my back, man.
[02:11:18.033 --> 02:11:18.413]  That's all.
[02:11:18.413 --> 02:11:19.853]  I mean, can I get anything?
[02:11:19.853 --> 02:11:21.574]  Okay, the jobs numbers are great.
[02:11:21.574 --> 02:11:21.814]  Yes.
[02:11:22.654 --> 02:11:25.136]  Finally, we have a president that wants to put America first.
[02:11:25.136 --> 02:11:25.656]  It's great.
[02:11:25.656 --> 02:11:28.599]  That's one level of things that he needs to do.
[02:11:28.599 --> 02:11:35.083]  But it's like, I'm telling you, man, people are going to get sick of standing up for this president if he doesn't start standing up for them.
[02:11:35.083 --> 02:11:36.044]  I'm just telling it like it is.
[02:11:36.044 --> 02:11:36.885]  Thanks for the call, Patrick.
[02:11:36.885 --> 02:11:38.005]  Let's go to Brian in Michigan.
[02:11:38.005 --> 02:11:40.307]  What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[02:11:40.307 --> 02:11:41.948]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:11:41.948 --> 02:11:44.190]  Yeah, first, I want to thank you, Owen, for all your hard work.
[02:11:44.190 --> 02:11:45.151]  It shows.
[02:11:45.151 --> 02:11:46.592]  We all see it.
[02:11:46.592 --> 02:11:52.096]  The thing that has freaked me out for a long time now is when I learned of the repealing of the Smith
[02:11:52.637 --> 02:11:53.899]  We're good to go.
[02:12:07.219 --> 02:12:10.541]  You know, so if you start to trace your life... Oh, I mean, that's just one thing, Brian.
[02:12:10.541 --> 02:12:15.163]  I mean, Obama passed legislation in 2016.
[02:12:15.163 --> 02:12:17.444]  What was that big omnibus spending bill?
[02:12:17.444 --> 02:12:23.706]  I think it was... He wrote into it, they're going to be fu... They literally said, we're funding propaganda in the United States.
[02:12:23.706 --> 02:12:24.367]  And they already did.
[02:12:24.367 --> 02:12:26.228]  It all came out in the Frank Church hearings.
[02:12:26.228 --> 02:12:29.649]  It all came out in the declassification of the JFK files.
[02:12:29.649 --> 02:12:30.810]  Project Mockingbird.
[02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:41.120]  The CIA has embeds in all television news, radio news, the Washington Post, New York Times, they're embedded everywhere.
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:45.004]  That's all public information and Obama just made it legal!
[02:12:45.004 --> 02:12:50.710]  There it is, Obama signs the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act, right there, 2016.
[02:12:50.710 --> 02:12:50.770]  Bam!
[02:12:52.972 --> 02:13:04.323]  And it'll be interesting to see what happens with this Covington case because you could see this turnaround where they don't have to pay anything because what they did because of this repealing of that act, completely legal.
[02:13:04.323 --> 02:13:05.944]  You know, that's an interesting point.
[02:13:05.944 --> 02:13:09.708]  And then on top of that, Jussie Smollett's case could be that too.
[02:13:09.708 --> 02:13:10.368]  Oh God.
[02:13:10.368 --> 02:13:15.173]  Because his court, his, the lawyers are saying there's no case against him.
[02:13:15.173 --> 02:13:16.554]  So yeah, maybe it's the same thing.
[02:13:16.554 --> 02:13:17.415]  Oh my gosh!
[02:13:17.415 --> 02:13:17.915]  Oh my gosh!
[02:13:18.789 --> 02:13:27.797]  So what if, what if they investigate Jussie Smollett and they find out that he was actually being run by, let's say Kamala Harris or Barack Obama.
[02:13:27.797 --> 02:13:30.680]  Oh, and then they say, oh no, no, Obama says, look, I signed this legislation.
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:32.602]  It's legal for me to do it.
[02:13:32.602 --> 02:13:36.125]  So yeah, it's legal for us to stage hate crimes and blame Trump supporters.
[02:13:36.125 --> 02:13:37.726]  Obama signed it into law.
[02:13:37.726 --> 02:13:38.127]  Well, look.
[02:13:38.527 --> 02:13:42.932]  Democrats are signing it into law that you can break a newborn baby's neck!
[02:13:42.932 --> 02:13:45.975]  That doesn't make it right, and it definitely doesn't make it legal.
[02:13:45.975 --> 02:13:46.475]  I'm sorry.
[02:13:46.475 --> 02:13:48.637]  You can sign any bill and claim it's legal.
[02:13:48.637 --> 02:13:49.298]  This is Republic.
[02:13:49.298 --> 02:13:50.619]  You're murdering infants.
[02:13:50.619 --> 02:13:58.187]  You're going straight to hell, but you ought to maybe, you know, Gavin Newsom says they're ending the death penalty, but uh... Anyway, let's go to Richard in Minnesota.
[02:13:58.187 --> 02:14:00.289]  What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[02:14:01.758 --> 02:14:06.400]  Well, first of all, I just want to tell you that you're focusing too much on old news Hillary Clinton.
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:11.402]  The real first lady you got to worry about, the real threat to Trump in America, is Michelle Obama.
[02:14:11.402 --> 02:14:15.343]  Because when she announces, she's a shoe-in friend.
[02:14:15.343 --> 02:14:20.125]  And she'll take that fake Mexican Beto O'Rourke to be her running mate.
[02:14:20.125 --> 02:14:22.046]  And then we're in real trouble.
[02:14:22.046 --> 02:14:30.449]  But I just want to say, on my original topic, what makes America great again, all the sanctuary city mayors and governors and
[02:14:31.328 --> 02:14:33.329]  Whoever else.
[02:14:33.329 --> 02:14:40.432]  We're giving a giant middle finger to America saying we don't like your immigration laws and we don't like what Trump says.
[02:14:40.432 --> 02:14:42.853]  They need to be arrested.
[02:14:42.853 --> 02:14:44.534]  Well, it's literally illegal.
[02:14:44.534 --> 02:14:45.794]  I've broken down the U.S.
[02:14:45.794 --> 02:14:46.375]  code.
[02:14:46.375 --> 02:14:48.475]  They do belong in jail with fines.
[02:14:48.475 --> 02:14:49.656]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:14:49.656 --> 02:14:53.738]  And in the cities, I had a story today, a legal immigrant charged of
[02:14:55.021 --> 02:14:55.981]  I don't even know where it was.
[02:14:55.981 --> 02:14:57.282]  I put it away.
[02:14:57.282 --> 02:15:14.549]  But if you are a politician that helped make your city or whatever state a sanctuary city or state, and then a non-citizen murders someone in your sanctuary city or state, you are now liable to face life in jail.
[02:15:14.549 --> 02:15:15.630]  That's the U.S.
[02:15:15.630 --> 02:15:15.930]  Code.
[02:15:15.930 --> 02:15:16.690]  That's the law.
[02:15:16.690 --> 02:15:18.251]  I've broke that down.
[02:15:18.251 --> 02:15:19.031]  Absolutely, Richard.
[02:15:19.031 --> 02:15:20.592]  Let's go to Kevin.
[02:15:20.592 --> 02:15:20.892]  You know what?
[02:15:20.892 --> 02:15:22.072]  We're out of time here in this segment.
[02:15:22.072 --> 02:15:22.913]  We'll come back with Kevin.
[02:15:23.613 --> 02:15:25.294]  Folks, please go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:15:25.294 --> 02:15:26.314]  I've barely even plugged today.
[02:15:26.314 --> 02:15:27.035]  We need your support.
[02:15:27.035 --> 02:15:28.736]  We're being censored off all platforms.
[02:15:28.736 --> 02:15:34.999]  Eventually, they'll probably erase anybody who ever steps foot in this building off social media because the president already said he's not going to do anything about it, so...
[02:15:35.774 --> 02:15:36.714]  So that's nice.
[02:15:36.714 --> 02:15:40.616]  So the president has now empowered social media to just erase every conservative.
[02:15:40.616 --> 02:15:41.556]  Thanks, President Trump.
[02:15:41.556 --> 02:15:45.897]  It's so great to have your back through all this censorship, that we get censored for having your back.
[02:15:45.897 --> 02:15:48.678]  But we'll still do it because we're the Winter Soldier.
[02:15:48.678 --> 02:15:52.740]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and support us today so that we can be on air tomorrow.
[02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:53.220]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:55.387 --> 02:16:00.369]  Number one international best-selling author, Matthew David Hurtado's pain was simple.
[02:16:00.369 --> 02:16:05.651]  Lyme disease bankrupt him in 2009, watching bankers take everything from his family.
[02:16:05.651 --> 02:16:14.495]  After building a seven-figure business from his couch, God called him to ministry to teach prosperity based on pain he could not tolerate in others' lives.
[02:16:14.935 --> 02:16:17.558]  IRS, creditors, car loans, debt.
[02:16:17.558 --> 02:16:22.363]  It's the Babylonian system and you have to escape it before it's too late.
[02:16:22.363 --> 02:16:25.406]  Haven't you ever wanted to wake up from this nightmare?
[02:16:25.406 --> 02:16:32.393]  Matthew David's free quick study guide shows you what to do today to build lasting wealth in any economy.
[02:16:32.393 --> 02:16:34.074]  His discovery he made?
[02:16:34.074 --> 02:16:34.495]  It's all
[02:16:34.735 --> 02:16:34.975]  Thank you.
[02:16:55.302 --> 02:16:56.543]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.543 --> 02:17:00.464]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.464 --> 02:17:02.005]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:02.005 --> 02:17:04.966]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.966 --> 02:17:10.508]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.508 --> 02:17:11.728]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.728 --> 02:17:14.649]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:14.649 --> 02:17:16.870]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:21.312]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:17:21.312 --> 02:17:23.613]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:17:24.873 --> 02:17:31.218]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:31.218 --> 02:17:34.260]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:40.205]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:40.205 --> 02:17:43.988]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.988 --> 02:17:45.249]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:45.249 --> 02:17:46.590]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.590 --> 02:17:52.795]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:52.795 --> 02:17:54.236]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:56.536 --> 02:18:02.564]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:18:02.564 --> 02:18:05.507]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.

[02:19:59.357 --> 02:20:01.947]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:27.546 --> 02:20:43.650]  Yeah, it's days like these where I totally understand why Americans just want to go to a ball game, drink cold beer, eat a hot dog, hang out at the bar for a drink afterwards, just go home and just not even think about any of it.
[02:20:43.650 --> 02:20:48.332]  But it won't be long, you won't even be able to do that.
[02:20:48.332 --> 02:20:53.833]  Because there'll be no infrastructure, there'll be no economy, there'll be no commerce, there'll be no commute.
[02:20:56.405 --> 02:20:57.985]  Nah, but you know, who cares, right?
[02:20:57.985 --> 02:20:59.806]  It'll all just magically work itself out.
[02:20:59.806 --> 02:21:02.486]  You just gotta be really good.
[02:21:02.486 --> 02:21:07.547]  By the way, there's this viral clip going around of Bernie Sanders using the N-word.
[02:21:07.547 --> 02:21:17.369]  And it's not even like... It's just... It's literally like... It's almost as racist as you could use it.
[02:21:17.369 --> 02:21:20.609]  It's not like he's using it like, oh, you know, hey man, or hey bro, or whatever.
[02:21:20.609 --> 02:21:24.250]  He's like, using it as like a total insult.
[02:21:24.250 --> 02:21:24.330]  Um...
[02:21:25.143 --> 02:21:29.765]  You know what, but I don't even know if I want to play it.
[02:21:29.765 --> 02:21:40.331]  And, you know, it's like the same thing today where Alex and I are on the same wavelength and we're both just really upset at the president right now.
[02:21:40.331 --> 02:21:45.754]  For kowtowing to social media censorship.
[02:21:45.754 --> 02:21:49.876]  When he says you fight it by just being good.
[02:21:49.876 --> 02:21:51.977]  Well, President Trump, that's what they told you.
[02:21:53.274 --> 02:21:56.617]  When you were running for president, did you just decide to just be good?
[02:21:56.617 --> 02:21:57.398]  Is that how you won?
[02:21:57.398 --> 02:22:04.404]  No, you win by maintaining the fight.
[02:22:04.404 --> 02:22:12.631]  Free speech wins, President Trump, not being good.
[02:22:12.631 --> 02:22:14.312]  But you know what?
[02:22:14.312 --> 02:22:17.575]  Cold beer and a ball game sounds a lot more fun than fighting tyranny, doesn't it?
[02:22:17.575 --> 02:22:19.777]  Who wants to shove a vaccine in your newborns?
[02:22:21.184 --> 02:22:27.089]  Alright, we're taking your calls, we've been doing it for over an hour now.
[02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:57.129]  Hey Owen, yeah, we gotta keep the Christian values going in our country, but we need to end the Fed, re-establish the gold and silver standard, and tell Trump to stay away from Dealey Plaza, and then also end voter fraud.
[02:22:57.129 --> 02:23:01.172]  I think we get this thing going, we're gonna have some big changes.
[02:23:01.172 --> 02:23:05.215]  Have you seen the President giving you any signs that he's gonna do any of that?
[02:23:05.215 --> 02:23:06.336]  A little bit, actually.
[02:23:06.336 --> 02:23:12.920]  I mean, we got things happening actually this month, the end of the month, where he's talking about it, but talk is cheap.
[02:23:13.971 --> 02:23:15.452]  Well, exactly.
[02:23:15.452 --> 02:23:27.380]  And you know, they did send Steve Munchen to Fort Knox back in February of 2017 and he claimed, oh, all the gold is still there.
[02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:35.186]  Yeah, we got to get these bankers who have defrauded us over the last hundred years and
[02:23:35.797 --> 02:23:40.559]  And just go ahead and take their gold like they do with all the other countries, and put that in Fort Knox.
[02:23:40.559 --> 02:23:43.500]  And it's all in the petrodollar now, thanks for the call, Kevin.
[02:23:43.500 --> 02:24:00.087]  But wasn't it, I believe it was the Texas state government in 2016 or 15, maybe in 15, that requested gold from the Federal Reserve, like, I guess it was like their
[02:24:01.109 --> 02:24:05.813]  The gold or whatever that they had the rights to, and so they requested it from Fort Knox and they were just shut down.
[02:24:05.813 --> 02:24:09.115]  They were like, nope, you don't get the gold.
[02:24:09.115 --> 02:24:13.859]  And the story was kind of like, oh, is there any gold even there?
[02:24:13.859 --> 02:24:15.981]  But of course, the entire U.S.
[02:24:15.981 --> 02:24:19.544]  currency, the Federal Reserve note, is all fiat currency.
[02:24:19.544 --> 02:24:26.710]  The Federal Reserve, excuse me, the Fractional Reserve Banking System is literally printing money out of thin air.
[02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:30.353]  I mean, literally, folks, you can read the manifesto.
[02:24:30.353 --> 02:24:30.733]  It's like,
[02:24:31.653 --> 02:24:33.174]  You want to know why we're really in debt?
[02:24:33.174 --> 02:24:35.895]  Because our currency is debt.
[02:24:35.895 --> 02:24:41.258]  Anyway, let's go to Hal in Florida, who's upset with today's show.
[02:24:41.258 --> 02:24:41.838]  Go ahead, Hal.
[02:24:41.838 --> 02:24:46.400]  What does President Trump need to do to keep America great again, or whatever you're so upset about?
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:49.181]  No, I'm not upset, but I think there might be a misunderstanding.
[02:24:49.181 --> 02:24:53.743]  I don't think you're using the Trump translator correctly, and it's just possible that you're not.
[02:24:53.743 --> 02:24:54.844]  But think about this.
[02:24:54.844 --> 02:24:58.666]  How do you beat Allen Iverson in one-on-one?
[02:24:58.666 --> 02:24:59.026]  You gotta...
[02:25:00.543 --> 02:25:01.304]  You gotta be good.
[02:25:01.304 --> 02:25:04.027]  You just gotta be really good.
[02:25:04.027 --> 02:25:10.895]  And I think what Trump is saying is not that you have to be good and bow to the censorship.
[02:25:10.895 --> 02:25:13.679]  I'm thinking that he's saying you have to be good
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:16.441]  To be able to beat this censorship.
[02:25:16.441 --> 02:25:18.521]  I mean, look at all the things that are going on in the background.
[02:25:18.521 --> 02:25:19.101]  Okay, okay.
[02:25:19.101 --> 02:25:20.882]  So you're saying... Okay, hold on, hold on.
[02:25:20.882 --> 02:25:22.142]  Let's actually bear down on this.
[02:25:22.142 --> 02:25:23.063]  I understand what you're saying.
[02:25:23.063 --> 02:25:28.084]  You're saying... President Trump is saying, like, oh, you have to be on your best behavior.
[02:25:28.084 --> 02:25:32.085]  You have to kind of do and go along with what they're demanding.
[02:25:32.085 --> 02:25:34.526]  They're saying you just have to be effective.
[02:25:34.526 --> 02:25:38.987]  You have to be effective and focused in your approach.
[02:25:38.987 --> 02:25:41.548]  I'm saying he's got a plan and he's doing stuff.
[02:25:41.548 --> 02:25:44.169]  Just like what's happening, you know, with this college scandal.
[02:25:44.557 --> 02:25:49.681]  Things are happening in the background and he's coming at him, but we don't know the ifs, thens that he's dealing with.
[02:25:49.681 --> 02:25:51.822]  So his game might be on.
[02:25:51.822 --> 02:25:54.364]  And he's saying, you just gotta be good.
[02:25:54.364 --> 02:25:56.745]  Like, you know, trust, trust, you know, I'm there.
[02:25:56.745 --> 02:26:03.150]  But don't you get the feeling, I get the feeling, Hal, that he's more concerned about Washington, D.C.
[02:26:03.150 --> 02:26:06.372]  having his back and not the American people having his back.
[02:26:06.372 --> 02:26:08.353]  Like, for example, arresting Hillary Clinton.
[02:26:08.353 --> 02:26:09.234]  Washington, D.C.
[02:26:09.234 --> 02:26:10.315]  wouldn't have his back on him.
[02:26:10.315 --> 02:26:12.016]  The American people would have his back.
[02:26:13.991 --> 02:26:17.173]  Absolutely, and I think we need to have his back.
[02:26:17.173 --> 02:26:22.536]  I think that might have been what he was talking about, too.
[02:26:22.536 --> 02:26:33.043]  If you listen to the way Trump has talked, since he's been running, he'll lay those kind of things out there like that, where it's like, wait a minute, President, what are you saying there?
[02:26:33.724 --> 02:26:35.244]  And it usually comes back.
[02:26:35.244 --> 02:26:39.425]  I mean, if you wait, you know, and you give it a few days, it usually comes back around.
[02:26:39.425 --> 02:26:40.805]  Well, I agree with you, Hal.
[02:26:40.805 --> 02:26:41.926]  I do agree with you.
[02:26:41.926 --> 02:26:42.846]  I do agree with you, Hal.
[02:26:42.846 --> 02:26:43.926]  And I've said 60 seconds.
[02:26:43.926 --> 02:26:44.826]  I gave you more than that.
[02:26:44.826 --> 02:26:46.026]  So I appreciate your call.
[02:26:46.026 --> 02:26:46.766]  It was a good call.
[02:26:46.766 --> 02:26:48.067]  Fair points.
[02:26:48.067 --> 02:26:50.307]  And I kind of understand what you're saying.
[02:26:50.307 --> 02:26:53.368]  It's like, you know, the NFL is rigged.
[02:26:53.368 --> 02:26:54.548]  You know, the NBA is rigged.
[02:26:54.548 --> 02:26:55.608]  The sports are rigged.
[02:26:55.608 --> 02:27:00.889]  You know, but you still go out there and I guess you do your best or you do good or you do really good and you hope that you can beat the rigged system.
[02:27:01.838 --> 02:27:03.919]  But wouldn't you rather just have a fair fight?
[02:27:03.919 --> 02:27:04.959]  You know, I don't know.
[02:27:04.959 --> 02:27:09.101]  Let's go to Lori in Alaska.
[02:27:09.101 --> 02:27:13.242]  Lori, what must President Trump do to keep America great?
[02:27:13.242 --> 02:27:18.704]  Hey, it pains me to say what I'm about to say, but I believe it to be so.
[02:27:18.704 --> 02:27:22.846]  I believe that he's going to have to declare a hard martial law.
[02:27:22.846 --> 02:27:28.188]  And I say that because we lost this republic under martial law under Lincoln.
[02:27:28.584 --> 02:27:40.328]  You see Thomas DiLorenzo, Judge Andrew Napolitano, and with all these hyenas nipping at his heels, trying to interfere with everything he's trying to do, he's going to be lame duck if he doesn't.
[02:27:40.328 --> 02:27:47.310]  So it pains me to say so, but I think he's going to have to do that where he can stop this and get done what needs to get done.
[02:27:47.310 --> 02:27:48.750]  Well, thanks for the call, Laurie.
[02:27:48.750 --> 02:27:56.673]  I disagree with you on your declaration of martial law, but I agree with your sentiment that it has to be extreme action.
[02:27:57.608 --> 02:28:02.009]  Yes, extreme action must be taken because we're in extreme danger.
[02:28:02.009 --> 02:28:02.449]  Absolutely.
[02:28:02.449 --> 02:28:03.569]  And that's why we elected Trump.
[02:28:03.569 --> 02:28:04.410]  That's why Trump won.
[02:28:04.410 --> 02:28:06.130]  I mean, he said it himself.
[02:28:06.130 --> 02:28:09.871]  He said, the only way I'm going to run is if I look at this country and it's in extreme danger.
[02:28:09.871 --> 02:28:12.532]  Well, that's where we're at right now.
[02:28:12.532 --> 02:28:18.893]  And isn't it funny where people like Cortez will sit here and say that the president is an authoritarian.
[02:28:18.893 --> 02:28:25.815]  Again, based on principle, I would never call for that, but in a devil worldly
[02:28:28.497 --> 02:28:38.903]  I kind of wish he was an authoritarian because that might be the only thing that would actually get this corruption out of this country, get this big fat monkey off of our back.
[02:28:38.903 --> 02:28:39.943]  Alright folks, we're going to a break.
[02:28:39.943 --> 02:28:41.044]  We're going to keep taking your calls.
[02:28:41.044 --> 02:28:43.225]  What must President Trump do to keep America great?
[02:28:43.225 --> 02:28:52.169]  Please go to Infowarsstore.com during this break and support Infowars because they're just going to try to erase us off of the entire earth if they could.
[02:28:55.168 --> 02:28:57.530]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[02:28:57.530 --> 02:29:00.412]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[02:29:00.412 --> 02:29:05.476]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:29:05.476 --> 02:29:12.661]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.661 --> 02:29:17.225]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:29:17.805 --> 02:29:21.448]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:21.448 --> 02:29:24.571]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.571 --> 02:29:27.213]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:29:27.213 --> 02:29:28.714]  Get sober now.
[02:29:28.714 --> 02:29:32.057]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.

[02:29:40.124 --> 02:29:40.164]  800-213-9264
[02:29:56.445 --> 02:29:59.707]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[02:29:59.707 --> 02:30:02.689]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[02:30:02.689 --> 02:30:09.572]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[02:30:09.572 --> 02:30:10.713]  X2 is back.
[02:30:10.713 --> 02:30:11.493]  We got it.
[02:30:11.493 --> 02:30:13.174]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[02:30:13.174 --> 02:30:14.775]  We rushed it into production.
[02:30:14.775 --> 02:30:15.556]  It's been bottled.
[02:30:15.556 --> 02:30:17.537]  The labels are being put on today.
[02:30:17.537 --> 02:30:21.299]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the
[02:30:21.559 --> 02:30:21.699]  Yeah.

[02:31:56.457 --> 02:31:56.957]  It's simple.
[02:31:56.957 --> 02:32:03.078]  If you want to beat the globalists, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[02:32:03.078 --> 02:32:05.559]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[02:32:05.559 --> 02:32:09.180]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late term abortion and all the great it is.
[02:32:09.180 --> 02:32:11.961]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[02:32:11.961 --> 02:32:13.041]  What is the top tumor?
[02:32:13.041 --> 02:32:15.182]  It's a bestseller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[02:32:15.182 --> 02:32:17.102]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[02:32:17.222 --> 02:32:18.263]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[02:32:18.263 --> 02:32:20.205]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[02:32:20.205 --> 02:32:23.948]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[02:32:23.948 --> 02:32:26.770]  I'm like, uh, what's the hottest you could do a month later?
[02:32:26.770 --> 02:32:27.251]  Uh, 90, 95%.
[02:32:27.251 --> 02:32:28.692]  No one's ever done it.
[02:32:28.692 --> 02:32:30.613]  I said, how much does that cost per bottle?
[02:32:30.613 --> 02:32:31.554]  It costs $10.
[02:32:31.554 --> 02:32:33.055]  No one's ever done that.
[02:32:33.055 --> 02:32:35.758]  Sir, the average competitor is 3 to 5%.
[02:32:35.758 --> 02:32:36.558]  The top brand's 50%.
[02:32:36.558 --> 02:32:38.460]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[02:32:39.721 --> 02:32:42.642]  I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information's explosive?
[02:32:42.642 --> 02:32:43.262]  Our fish oil.
[02:32:43.262 --> 02:32:45.782]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[02:32:45.782 --> 02:32:46.842]  My children take it.
[02:32:46.842 --> 02:32:51.183]  You think I'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[02:32:51.183 --> 02:32:54.203]  You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[02:32:54.203 --> 02:32:54.664]  Never!
[02:32:54.664 --> 02:32:58.844]  Inforestware.com.
[02:32:58.844 --> 02:33:01.505]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.124 --> 02:33:30.188]  There's some developing news happening right now I want to address before I go back to your phone calls.
[02:33:30.188 --> 02:33:41.835]  President Trump has just announced that the United States will ground all Boeing MAX 737s as Alex Jones is on one in air!
[02:33:41.835 --> 02:33:45.077]  Does that mean they're gonna ground him right out of a flight?
[02:33:45.077 --> 02:33:49.780]  Or does Alex Jones make it back to Austin in perhaps the final flight?
[02:33:51.084 --> 02:33:52.805]  Of a Boeing Max 8?
[02:33:52.805 --> 02:33:54.145]  Domestically?
[02:33:54.145 --> 02:33:55.705]  Wow!
[02:33:55.705 --> 02:33:57.406]  So Trump has just announced that.
[02:33:57.406 --> 02:33:59.867]  I'm actually glad to see that.
[02:33:59.867 --> 02:34:04.248]  Because pilots have been complaining about this aircraft.
[02:34:04.248 --> 02:34:07.109]  And it's because you can't even be a pilot and fly it.
[02:34:07.109 --> 02:34:08.429]  You have to be a computer expert.
[02:34:08.429 --> 02:34:10.870]  That's all the new stuff that they have now.
[02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:12.810]  It's like you don't even drive your car anymore.
[02:34:12.810 --> 02:34:16.791]  You just flip it on autopilot and take a nap.
[02:34:16.791 --> 02:34:17.772]  So that's developing.
[02:34:17.772 --> 02:34:18.432]  But you know, I'll tell you.
[02:34:19.571 --> 02:34:28.001]  The dangers of the Boeing Max 8 are nothing compared to the dangers of 5G.
[02:34:28.001 --> 02:34:30.645]  This story just came to my desk.
[02:34:30.645 --> 02:34:32.407]  Does 5G internet really give you cancer?
[02:34:32.407 --> 02:34:33.668]  Here's what we know and don't know.
[02:34:34.597 --> 02:34:50.610]  And basically, yes, it has been declared a potential carcinogen to your brain and organs, and it has been linked to cancer and death in rats and birds.
[02:34:50.610 --> 02:34:52.831]  And you can look where they put the new 5G towers up.
[02:34:52.831 --> 02:34:55.914]  If there's trees next to it, the trees die.
[02:34:55.914 --> 02:35:00.697]  So now they're putting fake trees next to 5G cell towers so you don't see the death.
[02:35:00.697 --> 02:35:02.319]  Oh, oh, and then there was a story in the news
[02:35:07.728 --> 02:35:21.579]  Parents blame elementary school's cell tower after fourth student designated with cancer.
[02:35:21.579 --> 02:35:21.999]  Boy.
[02:35:21.999 --> 02:35:23.761]  Mm.
[02:35:23.761 --> 02:35:25.022]  Mm mm mm.
[02:35:27.042 --> 02:35:31.847]  Pediatric cancer is just soaring through the roof, but it has nothing to do with the vaccines.
[02:35:31.847 --> 02:35:37.093]  It has nothing to do with the 5G cell towers, where now there's a cell tower on a school.
[02:35:37.093 --> 02:35:39.756]  We've ruined the clip from CBS.
[02:35:39.756 --> 02:35:43.961]  Four kids have been diagnosed with cancer next to this cell tower.
[02:35:51.661 --> 02:35:58.666]  Another developing story is spiraling around Jacob Wool, who's been on this broadcast.
[02:35:58.666 --> 02:36:01.167]  I've interviewed him before.
[02:36:01.167 --> 02:36:14.996]  The claim is that he created a Twitter account to basically send a message to himself claiming a death threat, hate crime, which was then turned over to Minnesota police.
[02:36:14.996 --> 02:36:17.398]  This is all being investigated right now.
[02:36:17.398 --> 02:36:18.118]  He's denying it.
[02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:25.244]  Now, again, if conservatives start faking hate crimes against themselves, that's not good.
[02:36:25.244 --> 02:36:25.985]  I disavow that.
[02:36:25.985 --> 02:36:27.866]  We don't need to do that, Jacob.
[02:36:27.866 --> 02:36:31.750]  If you want people to create a hate crime against you, just go out on the street and wear a Trump hat.
[02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:33.291]  Don't fake it.
[02:36:33.291 --> 02:36:35.012]  But he's denying it.
[02:36:35.012 --> 02:36:38.035]  And so, you know, I hope it's not true, obviously.
[02:36:38.035 --> 02:36:41.878]  I don't want to see fake hate crimes on any side of the aisle.
[02:36:41.878 --> 02:36:47.042]  But on a certain level, again, and I don't know Jacob personally, I mean, I've interviewed him.
[02:36:49.235 --> 02:36:56.567]  If he is telling the truth, and the Minnesota police do follow through with the investigation, they find out that he didn't make the account?
[02:36:57.248 --> 02:37:01.932]  It'll be pretty funny to watch all these lefties, they're saying he did it, just cry.
[02:37:01.932 --> 02:37:08.478]  Now, if he did fake it, and it was a fake account, and he sent the message, then yeah, that's bad news.
[02:37:08.478 --> 02:37:10.980]  And I mean, we'll report it, I'm not going to avoid it.
[02:37:10.980 --> 02:37:15.685]  But I just wanted to put that out there, because that whole story is going viral right now, he has been a guest on the show.
[02:37:15.685 --> 02:37:19.148]  Jacob, I hope that you're telling the truth, but the investigation and the facts will come out.
[02:37:19.928 --> 02:37:25.532]  Dude, if you want to have somebody commit a hate crime against you, just walk around the streets of New York in a Trump hat, bro.
[02:37:25.532 --> 02:37:28.354]  A lot easier than faking it, if that was the case.
[02:37:28.354 --> 02:37:29.215]  Only time will tell.
[02:37:29.215 --> 02:37:31.557]  There is an investigation going.
[02:37:31.557 --> 02:37:39.042]  Alright, I'm asking people, what must President Trump do to keep America great?
[02:37:39.042 --> 02:37:42.505]  Let's go to James in Oregon.
[02:37:42.505 --> 02:37:45.787]  Go ahead, James.
[02:37:45.787 --> 02:37:46.828]  Hello?
[02:37:46.828 --> 02:37:46.988]  Hi.
[02:37:48.380 --> 02:37:52.122]  Hi, thank you for taking my call, first-time caller.
[02:37:52.122 --> 02:37:54.503]  I think he needs to keep on keeping on.
[02:37:54.503 --> 02:38:01.786]  The reason I say that, we like to point to President Trump and say, he didn't do this, he didn't build the wall.
[02:38:01.786 --> 02:38:04.927]  He doesn't build the wall.
[02:38:04.927 --> 02:38:07.048]  He doesn't actually keep the aliens out.
[02:38:07.048 --> 02:38:15.932]  We pass laws, he passes executive orders, signs them, puts them into place, and our judges stop the orders.
[02:38:17.145 --> 02:38:19.426]  Our Congress people stopped the system.
[02:38:19.426 --> 02:38:22.027]  So does he need the support from inside the beltway?
[02:38:22.027 --> 02:38:23.247]  He absolutely does.
[02:38:23.247 --> 02:38:25.168]  But he needs our support.
[02:38:25.168 --> 02:38:29.749]  Because we're falling down when we accused him of not doing his job.
[02:38:29.749 --> 02:38:31.890]  Because we didn't get what we wanted.
[02:38:31.890 --> 02:38:33.550]  James, James, I understand that.
[02:38:33.550 --> 02:38:38.232]  But you gotta understand, philosophically, intellectually, I'm running out of gas, man.
[02:38:40.013 --> 02:38:40.594]  I understand.
[02:38:40.594 --> 02:38:41.636]  Me too.
[02:38:41.636 --> 02:38:55.535]  I mean, I see we're in a really terrible position, but everything that I've heard here with taking the money from so-and-so and giving it to such-and-such and stopping these companies and shutting them down, he's not the king.
[02:38:57.165 --> 02:38:58.526]  I'm not sure what you're talking about.
[02:38:58.526 --> 02:39:00.607]  What are you talking about taking money?
[02:39:00.607 --> 02:39:03.128]  By our laws, we can't walk in and take away his money.
[02:39:03.128 --> 02:39:04.068]  Oh, but hold on a second.
[02:39:04.068 --> 02:39:07.170]  No, no, no, but James, now hold on a second.
[02:39:07.170 --> 02:39:10.131]  There's actually precedent in the private sector.
[02:39:10.131 --> 02:39:14.954]  I mean, when companies get away with massive crimes that make all this money, they lose all that money.
[02:39:14.954 --> 02:39:16.735]  They don't get to keep that money.
[02:39:16.735 --> 02:39:21.277]  So how come the universities get to keep it when they're involved in massive scams?
[02:39:21.277 --> 02:39:23.018]  Well, who takes away their money?
[02:39:23.018 --> 02:39:24.258]  The IRS?
[02:39:24.258 --> 02:39:25.139]  It's not the President.
[02:39:26.755 --> 02:39:28.276]  Who orders the IRS?
[02:39:28.276 --> 02:39:33.979]  Obama used the IRS to target conservatives?
[02:39:33.979 --> 02:39:35.100]  They have no problems.
[02:39:35.100 --> 02:39:39.822]  They have the government behind them.
[02:39:39.822 --> 02:39:42.784]  It's our president that doesn't have the government behind him.
[02:39:42.784 --> 02:39:49.808]  So you think the current pace we're on, America will be fine if Trump doesn't win in 2020?
[02:39:49.808 --> 02:39:51.088]  No.
[02:39:51.088 --> 02:39:52.229]  I don't think we're going to be fine.
[02:39:52.918 --> 02:39:55.559]  Well, you just said Trump keeps keeping on and that's how we keep it great.
[02:39:55.559 --> 02:39:57.119]  He has to keep going.
[02:39:57.119 --> 02:39:59.820]  It's not just him.
[02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:01.860]  It's not just the president.
[02:40:01.860 --> 02:40:06.081]  He doesn't have the power to do everything that we're demanding that he do.
[02:40:06.081 --> 02:40:07.742]  He can work on it.
[02:40:07.742 --> 02:40:09.422]  He could try to pass laws.
[02:40:09.422 --> 02:40:11.903]  He could try to sign bills.
[02:40:11.903 --> 02:40:18.525]  But if we have judges that we have in our cities standing up and saying, no, no, no, he can't do that.
[02:40:18.525 --> 02:40:19.385]  I'm ruling against it.
[02:40:21.184 --> 02:40:25.267]  And we don't do something about standing up against those judges?
[02:40:25.267 --> 02:40:29.350]  If our representatives in Congress- James, James, you are right.
[02:40:29.350 --> 02:40:30.951]  James, you are definitely right.
[02:40:30.951 --> 02:40:32.312]  And I do agree with you.
[02:40:32.312 --> 02:40:37.775]  However, the president does have constitutional power to do stuff about this.
[02:40:37.775 --> 02:40:39.036]  And that's the fact.
[02:40:39.036 --> 02:40:44.780]  I mean, he does have constitutional power to do something about this, to stop illegal immigration.
[02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:45.341]  He could do it.
[02:40:46.141 --> 02:40:54.086]  And I know that he needs people's help, and I know that he needs us to have his back, but he needs to understand, we do have his back when he does what's right.
[02:40:54.086 --> 02:41:01.790]  When he lets the swamp drain him, that's when we start to lose the belief that, hey, he's going to do everything we want him to do.
[02:41:01.790 --> 02:41:08.634]  We'll have the President's back, he needs to do what's right, even though if it seems it's going beyond his power, and the media will say that.
[02:41:08.634 --> 02:41:12.537]  He can cite the Constitution, say, this is my presidential duty,
[02:41:13.397 --> 02:41:15.939]  And forget the media that's going to lie about him all day long.
[02:41:15.939 --> 02:41:17.280]  They already have!
[02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:18.601]  So forget them.
[02:41:18.601 --> 02:41:21.563]  We will have his back, just like we did when we went to the polls for him.
[02:41:21.563 --> 02:41:22.223]  Great call, James.
[02:41:22.223 --> 02:41:26.065]  Let's go to Cole in California.
[02:41:26.065 --> 02:41:27.687]  What do we need to do to keep America great?
[02:41:27.687 --> 02:41:28.227]  Go ahead, Cole.
[02:41:29.071 --> 02:41:37.873]  Well, I think the president needs to regulate these giant social media platforms if he has the power or legislate because they control the narrative.
[02:41:37.873 --> 02:41:39.513]  You can see the effects on the streets.
[02:41:39.513 --> 02:41:42.674]  I live in a bastion of a failed state.
[02:41:42.674 --> 02:41:45.194]  Illegal immigrants everywhere.
[02:41:45.194 --> 02:41:47.534]  And it's just a failed, collapsed state, California.
[02:41:47.534 --> 02:41:53.216]  And look to us as an example of liberal politics and what happens when they take power.
[02:41:53.216 --> 02:41:55.016]  And because the left controls the narrative,
[02:41:56.553 --> 02:41:57.715]  You're seeing the effects of it.
[02:41:57.715 --> 02:42:03.244]  People are outraged at nothing and bad, ominous attacks on anybody with any common sense.
[02:42:03.244 --> 02:42:08.392]  By the way, out there in California, Governor Newsom just said they're going to get rid of the death penalty.
[02:42:10.185 --> 02:42:10.905]  Yeah.
[02:42:10.905 --> 02:42:12.366]  Because he loves life so much.
[02:42:12.366 --> 02:42:14.948]  Do abortion next, Governor Newsom.
[02:42:14.948 --> 02:42:15.868]  But here's the funny thing.
[02:42:15.868 --> 02:42:19.331]  I'm not even trying to inject my politics into that.
[02:42:19.331 --> 02:42:25.815]  California two years ago voted, the people of California voted to keep the death penalty.
[02:42:25.815 --> 02:42:29.497]  So Newsom just comes in as a dictate and just says we're not going to do that.
[02:42:29.497 --> 02:42:31.879]  As far as regulating social media, thanks for the call, Cole.
[02:42:33.912 --> 02:42:38.497]  Really, I just say, you just launch an investigation into these people and you're going to find something.
[02:42:38.497 --> 02:42:40.920]  You'll find antitrust violations.
[02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:42.782]  I'm sure they're doing something with dark money.
[02:42:42.782 --> 02:42:44.343]  I mean, they're working with China.
[02:42:44.343 --> 02:42:45.324]  I mean, who knows what they're doing?
[02:42:45.324 --> 02:42:47.307]  Launch an investigation into them.
[02:42:47.307 --> 02:42:48.147]  That's all you need to do.
[02:42:48.147 --> 02:42:49.188]  You'll find something.
[02:42:49.188 --> 02:42:51.030]  I don't know what it is.
[02:42:51.030 --> 02:42:52.392]  Guarantee you find something.
[02:42:52.392 --> 02:42:54.134]  Or you could be like Mueller and just make something up.
[02:42:55.376 --> 02:43:03.785]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.785 --> 02:43:05.006]  Believe me, I know.
[02:43:05.006 --> 02:43:09.951]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:09.951 --> 02:43:13.014]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:43:13.494 --> 02:43:15.176]  I still have that energy.
[02:43:15.176 --> 02:43:35.334]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:43:35.834 --> 02:43:39.819]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[02:43:43.504 --> 02:43:48.510]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.

[02:43:55.117 --> 02:44:04.408]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:44:04.408 --> 02:44:07.272]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:44:07.272 --> 02:44:13.339]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:44:13.980 --> 02:44:20.243]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:44:20.243 --> 02:44:26.525]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:44:26.525 --> 02:44:33.468]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:44:34.628 --> 02:44:47.642]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:44:47.642 --> 02:44:51.906]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:44:51.906 --> 02:44:54.609]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[02:44:58.996 --> 02:45:02.017]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:45:02.017 --> 02:45:08.459]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[02:45:08.459 --> 02:45:23.923]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[02:45:56.324 --> 02:46:02.329]  Our grandparents, our great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:46:02.329 --> 02:46:05.291]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.

[02:46:09.414 --> 02:46:09.855]  We're the top

[02:46:59.833 --> 02:47:02.515]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:10.121 --> 02:47:20.294]  Alright, Mike Adams is about to take over the fourth hour.
[02:47:20.294 --> 02:47:22.578]  We've been taking your calls, but I need to do a news blitz here.
[02:47:25.034 --> 02:47:34.338]  By the way, it's being rumored that Twitter is considering removing the reply numbers from tweets.
[02:47:34.338 --> 02:47:37.039]  I think we all know why that is.
[02:47:37.039 --> 02:47:42.240]  The same reason why Rotten Tomatoes censors its movie reviews.
[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:46.702]  Same reason why YouTube disables comments and likes.
[02:47:46.702 --> 02:47:51.144]  Because the leftists are getting destroyed by the ratio.
[02:47:52.077 --> 02:47:54.679]  So I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.
[02:47:54.679 --> 02:48:00.224]  And I'm thinking outside the box on this grounding of the Boeing Max 8.
[02:48:00.224 --> 02:48:03.247]  Most of them are still flying around the world.
[02:48:03.247 --> 02:48:04.728]  I understand why President Trump did it.
[02:48:04.728 --> 02:48:06.710]  But then I started to think outside the box.
[02:48:06.710 --> 02:48:11.674]  Because as far as I can tell, they still don't have a cause.
[02:48:11.674 --> 02:48:15.957]  They still don't know the cause for the Ethiopian airline crash.
[02:48:16.894 --> 02:48:20.517]  And so, again, I'm just thinking outside the box and just throwing this out there.
[02:48:20.517 --> 02:48:24.199]  I mean, what if there was some sort of sabotage involved in that?
[02:48:24.199 --> 02:48:26.341]  And that's what this is all about.
[02:48:26.341 --> 02:48:30.604]  Boeing is manufactured in America.
[02:48:30.604 --> 02:48:35.727]  But that's just, I don't know, kind of where my head went outside the box.
[02:48:35.727 --> 02:48:39.090]  Very important Alex Jones segment aired in the second hour, folks.
[02:48:39.090 --> 02:48:44.914]  Please take that segment and upload it to your YouTube channel so we can get that message to President Trump.
[02:48:46.232 --> 02:48:48.514]  Uh, but let me just bear down and do a news blitz here.
[02:48:48.514 --> 02:49:00.246]  Representative John Radcliffe, Lisa Page confirmed to me under oath that the FBI was ordered by the Obama Department of Justice not to consider charging Hillary Clinton for gross negligence in the handling of classified information.
[02:49:00.246 --> 02:49:04.069]  When will the investigations into that begin?
[02:49:04.069 --> 02:49:05.531]  I mean, nobody knew that happened.
[02:49:06.633 --> 02:49:09.756]  Department of Justice Watchdog refers Andrew McCabe to U.S.
[02:49:09.756 --> 02:49:11.977]  Attorney for criminal investigation.
[02:49:11.977 --> 02:49:19.304]  He was involved with trying to keep President Trump out of office and then in the attempts to get him removed from office.
[02:49:19.304 --> 02:49:24.368]  Watchdog sues for Rod Rosenstein's communications in days leading up to Mueller's appointment.
[02:49:24.368 --> 02:49:28.892]  That, if we get those, that's like game over right there.
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:36.443]  Representative Jim Jordan on Twitter, why did Adam Schiff try to block Congress from learning that the Clinton campaign paid for the dossier?
[02:49:36.443 --> 02:49:48.888]  Well, because Adam Schiff is a corrupt Democrat who had to protect the criminals at the top of the Democrat Party to get Trump out of office, so that's why Schiff is such a shifty Schiff liar.
[02:49:49.611 --> 02:50:03.225]  Also, Jim Jordan on Twitter, why did Adam Schiff say that his talks with Michael Cohen were limited to inviting him and allying any concerns about threats to his family, but not mentioning the 14 hours his staff spent prepping Cohen before the hearing?
[02:50:03.225 --> 02:50:06.929]  Because Adam Schiff is a dirty, dirty liar.
[02:50:09.291 --> 02:50:11.332]  Let's just move on here.
[02:50:11.332 --> 02:50:15.454]  Cynthia McKinney, I believe former Democrat from Georgia.
[02:50:15.454 --> 02:50:27.919]  Lindsey Graham on cue comes to the rescue of war and the cabal as he visits with Bibi Netanyahu to steal the Golan Heights from Syria for Genie Energy.
[02:50:27.919 --> 02:50:28.579]  Cynthia McKinney.
[02:50:29.707 --> 02:50:31.348]  Has always been pointing this out.
[02:50:31.348 --> 02:50:32.648]  Here's the story.
[02:50:32.648 --> 02:50:38.091]  Lindsey Graham to urge President Trump to recognize Golan Heights support Senate resolutions.
[02:50:38.091 --> 02:50:44.654]  So yeah, if you want to talk about Israel controlling our foreign policy, there's one for you.
[02:50:44.654 --> 02:50:46.795]  I'd rather just not get involved.
[02:50:46.795 --> 02:50:48.876]  I'm okay being allies with Israel.
[02:50:48.876 --> 02:50:50.737]  I'm okay that Israel exists.
[02:50:50.737 --> 02:50:56.740]  I'd like to protect it as a state, but the expansion and all this military protection and then just
[02:50:58.712 --> 02:51:00.733]  Bolstering more wars off of narratives.
[02:51:00.733 --> 02:51:03.593]  I'm not for all of that.
[02:51:03.593 --> 02:51:10.155]  Israel accuses PA of trying to spark violent religious war on Temple Mount.
[02:51:10.155 --> 02:51:13.656]  So the Palestinian Authority is saying Israel's doing it, framing us.
[02:51:13.656 --> 02:51:17.077]  Israel's saying Palestine is doing it and framing us.
[02:51:17.077 --> 02:51:19.838]  You know, again, I just want to keep all that crap out of the West.
[02:51:19.838 --> 02:51:20.858]  I just don't want to be involved in it.
[02:51:22.014 --> 02:51:23.935]  Uh, sad story out of Brazil.
[02:51:23.935 --> 02:51:27.277]  Two attackers killed eight and themselves at a Brazilian school.
[02:51:27.277 --> 02:51:33.741]  A shooting happened at a public school in Sao Paulo, where eight died.
[02:51:33.741 --> 02:51:37.704]  And you know, Bolsonaro was trying to get a second amendment there for Brazil.
[02:51:38.844 --> 02:51:43.248]  Which has been ridden by crime and drug cartels in the favelas.
[02:51:43.248 --> 02:51:53.096]  And so, I just have a bad feeling that the bad powers that be in Brazil are going to start staging attacks and coming after the guns.
[02:51:53.096 --> 02:51:54.497]  Oh, but that never happens.
[02:51:54.497 --> 02:51:56.299]  I'm sorry, I forgot.
[02:51:56.299 --> 02:52:00.422]  Nobody ever stages anything, fakes anything, the media never goes along with it.
[02:52:00.422 --> 02:52:01.083]  How dare I?
[02:52:02.215 --> 02:52:04.416]  As they say, they were throwing kids out of incubators.
[02:52:04.416 --> 02:52:05.776]  Fake news.
[02:52:05.776 --> 02:52:07.537]  They set aside used chemical weapons.
[02:52:07.537 --> 02:52:09.057]  Fake news.
[02:52:09.057 --> 02:52:12.538]  They said that ships were sunk in the Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:52:12.538 --> 02:52:13.158]  Fake news.
[02:52:13.158 --> 02:52:13.818]  Lies into war.
[02:52:13.818 --> 02:52:16.339]  But, you know, don't worry about that.
[02:52:16.339 --> 02:52:20.080]  Children among the 22 killed in Yemen strikes over the 48 hours.
[02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:21.080]  Nobody ever reports on this.
[02:52:21.080 --> 02:52:22.781]  It's funny.
[02:52:22.781 --> 02:52:29.763]  Just nobody ever reports on the bombings that happen in Yemen almost every day.
[02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:32.651]  Where are people on that?
[02:52:32.651 --> 02:52:33.691]  Russia mocks U.S.
[02:52:33.691 --> 02:52:35.893]  collusion probe ahead of Mueller's report.
[02:52:35.893 --> 02:52:39.995]  Yeah, the whole Russian collusion probe is a laughingstock around the world.
[02:52:39.995 --> 02:52:41.836]  What an embarrassment.
[02:52:41.836 --> 02:52:47.759]  Navy industry partners are under cyber-siege by Chinese hackers, review asserts.
[02:52:47.759 --> 02:52:48.740]  Well, let's not forget
[02:52:49.633 --> 02:52:52.055]  There were those naval ship crashes.
[02:52:52.055 --> 02:52:58.500]  Some people blamed the Obama appointee who was running the Naval Academy who had never been on a ship before.
[02:52:58.500 --> 02:53:01.383]  Others say that Chinese hackers were involved.
[02:53:01.383 --> 02:53:05.086]  Others say the naval crew was negligent.
[02:53:05.086 --> 02:53:08.629]  But there you go.
[02:53:08.629 --> 02:53:10.530]  Perhaps it was Chinese hackers.
[02:53:10.530 --> 02:53:14.534]  EU admits giving thousands of prepaid debit cards to migrants.
[02:53:14.534 --> 02:53:14.734]  Oh!
[02:53:18.069 --> 02:53:19.450]  This is from newswars.com.
[02:53:19.450 --> 02:53:21.972]  So now the EU is admitting it.
[02:53:21.972 --> 02:53:26.015]  Infowars.com told you that was going on last year.
[02:53:26.015 --> 02:53:29.998]  They did the same thing at the southern border here in the United States.
[02:53:29.998 --> 02:53:35.822]  Minority students offered no-whites safe space racial healing circle.
[02:53:35.822 --> 02:53:46.950]  San Diego State University is set to host a racial healing workshop for minority students and faculty later this month that aims to help students and professors of color get through college and career life.
[02:53:48.217 --> 02:53:50.298]  Do you hate white people?
[02:53:50.298 --> 02:54:00.325]  Come to San Diego State University, where your hatred for white people will be celebrated and discussed.
[02:54:00.325 --> 02:54:04.888]  Howard Schultz laments character assassination as he mulls 2020 White House run.
[02:54:04.888 --> 02:54:06.529]  Yeah, that's what you get, Howard.
[02:54:06.529 --> 02:54:07.029]  Don't you get it?
[02:54:07.029 --> 02:54:07.730]  You're an outsider.
[02:54:07.730 --> 02:54:09.551]  The Democrats hate you.
[02:54:09.551 --> 02:54:11.332]  You created your business.
[02:54:11.332 --> 02:54:12.573]  The Democrats hate you.
[02:54:14.121 --> 02:54:14.621]  It's really sad.
[02:54:14.621 --> 02:54:17.743]  I mean, again, Howard Schultz, I mean, I would vote for him.
[02:54:17.743 --> 02:54:22.487]  But as far as a Democrat candidate, if you were smart, that's the kind of guy that you'd want to compete with Trump.
[02:54:22.487 --> 02:54:26.389]  But the Democrats have an IQ collectively of four.
[02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:28.671]  Biden is going to run for president.
[02:54:28.671 --> 02:54:31.413]  That's what Dem lawmakers are saying.
[02:54:31.413 --> 02:54:34.915]  O'Rourke looks like he's gearing up to run for president as well.
[02:54:34.915 --> 02:54:39.959]  It's going to be fun to see all of these losers run as they cast off people that could actually be powerful.
[02:54:41.348 --> 02:54:50.535]  Democrat options like Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang and Howard Schultz and Bloomberg was smart enough to know he's just not even going to deal with them.
[02:54:50.535 --> 02:54:52.397]  Hipsters mostly look alike.
[02:54:52.397 --> 02:54:53.518]  There's math to prove it.
[02:54:53.518 --> 02:54:54.539]  Yeah, it's funny.
[02:54:54.539 --> 02:55:03.405]  All these liberal progressive hipsters think that they're acting unique in all of the behavior that they engage in and what they wear and what they consume and where they eat.
[02:55:03.405 --> 02:55:05.707]  They're literally just carbon copies of one another.
[02:55:05.707 --> 02:55:07.709]  Total pawns of the establishment.
[02:55:08.803 --> 02:55:10.363]  Dems erasing middle America.
[02:55:10.363 --> 02:55:20.046]  Yeah, by trying to load up the east and west coast with a bunch of illegal voters and then end at the Electoral College, turn Texas blue, and then the Democrats win every election.
[02:55:20.046 --> 02:55:21.166]  There's no point of even voting.
[02:55:21.166 --> 02:55:23.106]  They win.
[02:55:23.106 --> 02:55:29.948]  Ex-New Jersey priest accused of sex abuse found shot to death in Nevada home.
[02:55:29.948 --> 02:55:32.988]  Scientists were bracing for a butterfly collapse.
[02:55:32.988 --> 02:55:34.869]  Now they're everywhere.
[02:55:35.865 --> 02:55:41.559]  Yeah, so just like the polar bears are going extinct, penguins are going extinct, the ice caps are melting, they're going to flood the world.
[02:55:41.559 --> 02:55:43.564]  It's always fake news with these Democrats.
[02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:48.904]  They wrote all kinds of legislation to pass bills to fund the protection of butterflies.
[02:55:48.904 --> 02:55:50.185]  Now they're everywhere.
[02:55:50.185 --> 02:55:51.646]  So here's the next one.
[02:55:51.646 --> 02:55:52.847]  Almost certain extinction.
[02:55:52.847 --> 02:55:55.709]  1,200 species under severe threat across the world.
[02:55:55.709 --> 02:55:57.610]  Well, yes, there are species that are under threat.
[02:55:57.610 --> 02:55:59.492]  I think the white rhino just died out.
[02:55:59.492 --> 02:56:03.315]  But they also discover like a thousand new species every year, too.
[02:56:03.315 --> 02:56:06.377]  But you watch all these species they claim are dying.
[02:56:06.377 --> 02:56:08.739]  They're probably just making it up to claim global warming.
[02:56:09.750 --> 02:56:13.891]  Gene-edited food quietly arrives in restaurant cooking oil.
[02:56:13.891 --> 02:56:14.751]  Yeah, gene-edited food.
[02:56:14.751 --> 02:56:17.012]  I'm sure there'll be no backlash there.
[02:56:17.012 --> 02:56:20.173]  Is it okay to tinker with the environment to fight climate change?
[02:56:20.173 --> 02:56:23.974]  This is the New York Times, where they're admitting chemtrails are real!
[02:56:23.974 --> 02:56:32.076]  So they admit chemtrails are real, they're spraying particles into the sky, we report on it and somehow we're fake news, and then they say, man-made global warming.
[02:56:32.076 --> 02:56:32.756]  And I say, really?
[02:56:32.756 --> 02:56:34.256]  You mean like those lines in the sky?
[02:56:34.256 --> 02:56:35.897]  Shut up, conspiracy theorists!
[02:56:37.554 --> 02:56:40.617]  Man gunned down outside bar after he joked about voting for Trump.
[02:56:40.617 --> 02:56:42.038]  That's just the loving, tolerant left.
[02:56:42.038 --> 02:56:44.100]  You know, they'll shoot Steve Scalise.
[02:56:44.100 --> 02:56:46.282]  I mean, these people are so loving and tolerant.
[02:56:46.282 --> 02:56:49.084]  They'll beat you half to death if you wear a Trump hat.
[02:56:49.084 --> 02:56:52.968]  CBS staffers in panic over call for $1 million in cuts.
[02:56:52.968 --> 02:56:53.428]  Uh-oh!
[02:56:53.428 --> 02:56:56.151]  Mainstream media is dying, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:56.151 --> 02:57:00.615]  Meanwhile, alternative press is sprouting up everywhere and having success.
[02:57:00.615 --> 02:57:02.537]  Facebook, Amazon, and Google have a 2020 problem.
[02:57:04.363 --> 02:57:12.845]  That's why they're trying to censor anybody who would call them out for their censorship and for supporting President Trump.
[02:57:12.845 --> 02:57:18.967]  Smollett team says the case against him is flimsy.
[02:57:18.967 --> 02:57:19.367]  Hmm.
[02:57:19.367 --> 02:57:20.608]  Yeah, we just have all the evidence.
[02:57:20.608 --> 02:57:20.968]  Wow.
[02:57:20.968 --> 02:57:23.548]  Real flimsy, yeah.
[02:57:23.548 --> 02:57:26.269]  Olin does not have a Keep America Great Again hat on.
[02:57:26.269 --> 02:57:27.029]  I'm not wearing one.
[02:57:27.029 --> 02:57:28.650]  There's no evidence of it.
[02:57:28.650 --> 02:57:32.871]  Glad to honor Jay-Z despite his long history of anti-gay lyrics.
[02:57:35.160 --> 02:57:35.761]  So there you go.
[02:57:35.761 --> 02:57:38.025]  What do we have to do to keep America great?
[02:57:38.025 --> 02:57:38.746]  What must Trump do?
[02:57:38.746 --> 02:57:39.808]  We took your calls.
[02:57:39.808 --> 02:57:41.531]  Mike Adams takes over in the fourth hour.
[02:57:41.531 --> 02:57:42.893]  This has been the Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:45.225 --> 02:57:47.726]  I've got some really good news, though.
[02:57:47.726 --> 02:57:49.106]  X2's back.
[02:57:49.106 --> 02:57:50.867]  The original X2.
[02:57:50.867 --> 02:57:53.768]  Deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[02:57:53.768 --> 02:57:54.868]  What you want.
[02:57:54.868 --> 02:57:55.989]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:55.989 --> 02:57:57.409]  It'll be here in a week.
[02:57:57.409 --> 02:57:58.970]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[02:57:58.970 --> 02:57:59.950]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:59.950 --> 02:58:02.871]  With the best iodine in the world, X2, it's available.
[02:58:02.871 --> 02:58:03.871]  I thought X3's great.
[02:58:03.871 --> 02:58:06.072]  We still got another deep-earth crystal source.
[02:58:06.072 --> 02:58:07.893]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[02:58:07.893 --> 02:58:08.793]  The scientists that do that.
[02:58:08.793 --> 02:58:11.054]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[02:58:11.894 --> 02:58:16.257]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[02:58:16.257 --> 02:58:22.442]  We now have X2 again, and in fullwarestore.com, so hallelujah, it's been sold out for about almost three months.
[02:58:22.442 --> 02:58:32.050]  But we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[02:58:32.050 --> 02:58:40.657]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,
[02:58:41.681 --> 02:58:44.924]  Get yours today at Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslive.com.
[02:58:55.595 --> 02:58:57.777]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:58:57.777 --> 02:59:06.487]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:59:06.487 --> 02:59:11.092]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:59:11.092 --> 02:59:12.534]  You are the info war.
[02:59:12.534 --> 02:59:16.058]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever.
[02:59:16.949 --> 02:59:28.112]  Everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:59:28.112 --> 02:59:36.095]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:59:36.095 --> 02:59:43.137]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:59:43.137 --> 02:59:45.878]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[02:59:49.366 --> 02:59:56.671]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:56.671 --> 02:59:57.812]  Big Brother.
[02:59:57.812 --> 02:59:59.693]  Mainstream media.
[02:59:59.693 --> 03:00:01.334]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:01.334 --> 03:00:02.855]  You want answers?
[03:00:02.855 --> 03:00:04.576]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:04.576 --> 03:00:07.498]  It's Mike Adams!
[03:00:07.498 --> 03:00:15.504]  Alright, Mike Adams here, filling in for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, March 13th.
[03:00:17.474 --> 03:00:19.715]  2019 got a lot to cover here for you today.
[03:00:19.715 --> 03:00:22.617]  As always, it's a packed fourth hour.
[03:00:22.617 --> 03:00:27.100]  Owen, I was amazed how he was able to get through all the news there in that last segment.
[03:00:27.100 --> 03:00:31.463]  Covered a lot of headlines, but I've got some analysis, as usual, on some different topics.
[03:00:31.463 --> 03:00:33.184]  So first, we're going to talk about Venezuela.
[03:00:33.764 --> 03:00:38.326]  What's actually happening there and what it means about the coming collapse for America.
[03:00:38.326 --> 03:00:39.807]  We can learn a lot.
[03:00:39.807 --> 03:00:57.536]  You know, as much as we pray for those people who are victimized and as much as we don't want to see other human beings suffer, there are also some very important lessons that we can learn, including lessons of how did the Venezuelan voters create this situation unintentionally for themselves?
[03:00:57.536 --> 03:01:00.798]  You know, they gave up their guns and then they voted for socialism.
[03:01:01.258 --> 03:01:10.724]  Now, sadly, many of them are experiencing the devastating effects, the repercussions of those decisions while dragging along those people who voted against socialism.
[03:01:10.724 --> 03:01:20.249]  There's a very big warning lesson in this for Americans and the rise of socialism among America's youth.
[03:01:20.249 --> 03:01:29.555]  Also going to cover today, forbidden speech and the authoritarian society that is now encroaching upon all of our abilities to speak or even to think.
[03:01:30.299 --> 03:01:38.924]  Now, you can't say the wrong things online, even if they're not hate-filled, you know, violent advocacy for violence or anything like that.
[03:01:38.924 --> 03:01:48.870]  You can be banned just because the CEO of Twitter or Facebook or Google doesn't like you and doesn't like what you're saying, or even criticizing those CEOs.
[03:01:48.870 --> 03:01:52.252]  That's what got me banned on Twitter now, I think, a couple of weeks ago.
[03:01:52.252 --> 03:01:57.515]  Just completely banned without any, there were no flags, there were no warnings, nothing.
[03:01:57.515 --> 03:01:59.937]  There was no explanation given, just completely banned.
[03:02:00.520 --> 03:02:01.600]  We're going to cover that today.
[03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:04.742]  Also, some action items for you.
[03:02:04.742 --> 03:02:07.203]  We have got to get a message to Trump.
[03:02:07.203 --> 03:02:09.303]  I know Mike Cernovich has been doing this.
[03:02:09.303 --> 03:02:12.064]  Owen Schroer, Alex Jones has been doing this.
[03:02:12.064 --> 03:02:23.509]  I'm going to double down on that today and say that if Trump doesn't address this fascism, this online censorship of free speech, then it's over for Trump and it's over for America.
[03:02:23.929 --> 03:02:29.911]  I'm going to have some homework for all of you today, some things that you can do to help us fight back against this.
[03:02:29.911 --> 03:02:32.332]  Time is quickly running out.
[03:02:32.332 --> 03:02:36.134]  If we don't jump on this right now, then it's lost.
[03:02:36.134 --> 03:02:43.537]  We will not be able to have any influence over society because all our voices are being systematically silenced.
[03:02:43.537 --> 03:02:46.598]  You know that, but I'll give you some new analysis.
[03:02:46.598 --> 03:02:48.839]  Also, farmlands and microplastics
[03:02:49.457 --> 03:03:00.319]  The average American is now eating literally many pounds of plastic every year through food that's grown on farmlands that are now being inundated with microplastics.
[03:03:00.319 --> 03:03:06.581]  This is a real environmental issue and it stems from bio-sludge that I've warned about for many years.
[03:03:06.581 --> 03:03:09.542]  I released that film, Biosludged.com.
[03:03:09.542 --> 03:03:11.722]  You can download it and watch it for free.
[03:03:11.722 --> 03:03:15.763]  The problem is there's a lot of plastic in the sewage that comes out of the cities.
[03:03:16.383 --> 03:03:23.190]  And so this plastic gets ground up and it's spread on farms as a form of, quote, fertilizer or nitrogen.
[03:03:23.190 --> 03:03:28.135]  Even though the plastic, of course, isn't nitrogen, there is nitrogen in the rest of the feces.
[03:03:28.135 --> 03:03:31.438]  And so farmlands are now being heavily contaminated.
[03:03:31.438 --> 03:03:32.860]  It's going into your food.
[03:03:32.860 --> 03:03:39.146]  You are now probably eating more plastic than you are minerals in the food supply, or at least trace minerals for that matter.
[03:03:40.780 --> 03:03:52.511]  Also today, gonna talk about the fake college admissions scandal, but a little bit of a different take on that because the person who ran that, Singer is his last name, was charged with racketeering.
[03:03:53.845 --> 03:03:56.626]  Why aren't the tech giants being charged with racketeering?
[03:03:56.626 --> 03:03:59.347]  Because what they're doing is meddling in elections.
[03:03:59.347 --> 03:04:05.488]  I mean, this guy just meddled in school admissions for some rich white chicks, right?
[03:04:05.488 --> 03:04:14.291]  And he gets charged with racketeering, but the tech giants that are meddling with our entire nation, our entire future, our elections, they're not getting charged with anything.
[03:04:14.938 --> 03:04:25.408]  And also today I'll be covering why are conservatives and Trump supporters always being charged with multiple crimes, like Manafort today, charged with yet more crimes.
[03:04:25.408 --> 03:04:36.299]  Meanwhile, Democrats are never charged with any crimes, it seems, even when they ferry out crimes that are far worse, such as obstruction of justice, obstruction of evidence, witness tampering, things like that.
[03:04:36.966 --> 03:04:39.449]  So all of that straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:39.449 --> 03:04:41.451]  Mike Adams filling in on the fourth hour.
[03:04:41.451 --> 03:04:41.951]  Stay with us.
[03:04:41.951 --> 03:04:47.537]  We'll be back with more details on all those topics and some other surprises as well.
[03:04:47.537 --> 03:04:49.059]  We'll be right back after this break.
[03:04:54.221 --> 03:04:59.423]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[03:04:59.423 --> 03:05:08.006]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:05:08.006 --> 03:05:10.987]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:05:10.987 --> 03:05:12.707]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:05:12.707 --> 03:05:18.989]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[03:05:21.090 --> 03:05:26.412]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[03:05:26.412 --> 03:05:29.354]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:05:29.354 --> 03:05:33.235]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:05:33.235 --> 03:05:37.277]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:05:37.277 --> 03:05:39.098]  I've got two in my home.
[03:05:39.098 --> 03:05:45.180]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:05:45.180 --> 03:05:46.021]  Don't live
[03:05:46.861 --> 03:05:50.924]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[03:05:50.924 --> 03:06:03.353]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:06:03.353 --> 03:06:04.553]  You found it.
[03:06:04.553 --> 03:06:06.595]  The tip of the spear.
[03:06:06.595 --> 03:06:11.098]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:06:13.914 --> 03:06:14.796]  Mike Adams here today.
[03:06:14.796 --> 03:06:18.002]  We're going to talk about Venezuela and what we can learn from that situation.
[03:06:18.002 --> 03:06:19.685]  But first, I just want to mention.
[03:06:20.635 --> 03:06:23.557]  You know, don't trust the tech giants to get your information, obviously.
[03:06:23.557 --> 03:06:28.221]  Go directly to the independent media websites that you know and trust.
[03:06:28.221 --> 03:06:30.103]  Go directly to InfoWars.com.
[03:06:30.103 --> 03:06:32.985]  Go directly to my site, NaturalNews.com.
[03:06:32.985 --> 03:06:38.089]  Go directly to, you know, ZeroHedge or TheGatewayPundit.com or wherever you get your news.
[03:06:38.089 --> 03:06:39.130]  Go there directly.
[03:06:39.130 --> 03:06:43.734]  If you rely on a middleman, you will be, or your sources will be censored.
[03:06:43.734 --> 03:06:45.275]  You won't be able to get that information.
[03:06:46.178 --> 03:06:50.141]  And by the way, the tech giants eventually are going to start censoring in the browser.
[03:06:50.141 --> 03:06:54.544]  They're going to block URLs in the browser, but maybe I'll talk about that more later.
[03:06:54.544 --> 03:06:59.787]  Getting to Venezuela, some very important lessons that we can all learn from what's happening there.
[03:06:59.787 --> 03:07:04.530]  It's also about to turn to cannibalism, which is horrifying.
[03:07:04.530 --> 03:07:05.071]  It's sad.
[03:07:05.071 --> 03:07:09.694]  You know, the humanitarian side of all of us, we want to pray for those people.
[03:07:09.694 --> 03:07:13.296]  We don't want to see the suffering that's happening there.
[03:07:13.296 --> 03:07:14.077]  At the same time,
[03:07:15.519 --> 03:07:21.843]  I think it was Thatcher who said that in a democracy, people always get the government they deserve.
[03:07:21.843 --> 03:07:35.272]  The sad part about that is that in a democracy, and I understand America is a republic, not a democracy, but Venezuela was a mob rule kind of vote country where the majority ruled.
[03:07:36.067 --> 03:07:41.490]  And there were not constitutional protections for their people, not in the way we have with the Bill of Rights in the United States.
[03:07:41.490 --> 03:07:51.657]  So the mob that is the majority in Venezuela, which used to be a first world nation, very wealthy, sitting on incredible fossil fuel resources.
[03:07:51.657 --> 03:07:54.278]  It's like, it's almost like digging gold out of the ground.
[03:07:54.278 --> 03:07:57.320]  How can you go broke when you can dig gold out of the ground?
[03:07:57.320 --> 03:07:59.141]  I mean, black gold in the case of oil.
[03:07:59.141 --> 03:08:02.523]  You're just sitting on free money.
[03:08:02.523 --> 03:08:03.444]  How can you go broke?
[03:08:03.444 --> 03:08:05.085]  And the answer is socialism.
[03:08:05.672 --> 03:08:16.220]  You can go broke, you can lose your nation, and you can collapse into despotism and desperation and mass starvation, even now about to transition into cannibalism.
[03:08:16.220 --> 03:08:18.041]  How can that happen?
[03:08:18.041 --> 03:08:20.863]  The answer is the majority voted for it.
[03:08:20.863 --> 03:08:23.965]  They voted for socialism because they wanted free stuff.
[03:08:23.965 --> 03:08:25.907]  They wanted a government to take care of them.
[03:08:26.644 --> 03:08:32.987]  They bought the same thing that Gen Z is buying now in the United States, you know, the AOC followers.
[03:08:32.987 --> 03:08:47.053]  They buy this idea that the government should be your savior, the government should be your mommy and your daddy, and provide everything that you need from food and housing and education, and that all you have to do is be obedient and, you know, don't criticize the government because that would be wrong.
[03:08:47.053 --> 03:08:48.334]  The government is going to take care of you.
[03:08:48.334 --> 03:08:50.055]  The government is your God.
[03:08:50.055 --> 03:08:54.837]  And so back in, I think, around 2012, the Venezuelan people also gave up their guns.
[03:08:55.603 --> 03:09:01.868]  It was a nationwide gun confiscation effort that took place where the government literally went door-to-door.
[03:09:01.868 --> 03:09:06.691]  And of course they had the records of who owned the guns because they had a gun registration database.
[03:09:06.691 --> 03:09:15.618]  Which is the whole point of gun registration databases is to know where to send the government thugs to confiscate the weapons and shoot people who refuse to comply.
[03:09:15.618 --> 03:09:17.159]  And that's what Venezuela did.
[03:09:17.159 --> 03:09:22.763]  So they confiscated hundreds of thousands of firearms over a period of about three years from 2012 to about 2015.
[03:09:25.037 --> 03:09:30.782]  They imprisoned unknown thousands of people and they shot some people who refused to comply.
[03:09:30.782 --> 03:09:34.506]  And then the population was disarmed.
[03:09:34.506 --> 03:09:38.249]  But the gun control wackos in Venezuela said, no, that's great.
[03:09:38.249 --> 03:09:39.971]  Now we're going to be safe.
[03:09:39.971 --> 03:09:42.673]  We're not going to have citizens shooting citizens.
[03:09:42.673 --> 03:09:44.695]  The government will take care of us.
[03:09:44.695 --> 03:09:45.536]  Well, guess what you have now?
[03:09:46.744 --> 03:09:49.045]  Government shooting citizens, of course.
[03:09:49.045 --> 03:09:50.505]  You know where this leads.
[03:09:50.505 --> 03:10:03.368]  And not only that, but the Maduro regime is taking criminal, violent felons out of the prison system, putting police uniforms on them and handing them guns and saying, go shoot the protesters.
[03:10:03.368 --> 03:10:05.288]  Go shoot the dissidents.
[03:10:05.288 --> 03:10:14.591]  So the guns are being put into the hands of the violent criminals, as long as they're loyal to the government, to murder the citizens who voted against all this from the start.
[03:10:14.591 --> 03:10:16.091]  And what do we need to learn from this?
[03:10:16.954 --> 03:10:20.276]  In America, you might think this can never happen.
[03:10:20.276 --> 03:10:23.959]  It absolutely can happen, and it can happen virtually overnight.
[03:10:23.959 --> 03:10:34.086]  I mean, Venezuela went from a first world nation to a starvation, collapse, cannibalistic hellhole in about 10 to 15 years.
[03:10:34.086 --> 03:10:36.348]  That's all it took, like half a generation.
[03:10:36.348 --> 03:10:37.368]  That's it.
[03:10:37.368 --> 03:10:42.072]  From the time your kid is born to the time they get out of high school, your nation is gone.
[03:10:42.072 --> 03:10:42.672]  It's lost.
[03:10:42.672 --> 03:10:45.494]  It can happen that fast if you turn your nation over to socialism.
[03:10:46.528 --> 03:11:03.558]  So the lessons for Americans are, number one, even if you oppose socialism, you can be dragged into the muck because the masses have been convinced that this is the only way that they can have any kind of future.
[03:11:03.558 --> 03:11:11.503]  If the masses are brainwashed, which is exactly what's happening in our education system today, the universities are indoctrinating these young kids.
[03:11:12.179 --> 03:11:16.621]  And this is why they come out of the universities as fascists and socialists.
[03:11:16.621 --> 03:11:17.842]  They oppose free speech.
[03:11:17.842 --> 03:11:19.802]  They oppose free thinking.
[03:11:19.802 --> 03:11:23.824]  They demand obedience and they all think the same and they all look the same like these hipsters.
[03:11:23.824 --> 03:11:25.545]  They literally look exactly the same.
[03:11:26.269 --> 03:11:30.052]  And they are willing to kill you to take your guns.
[03:11:30.052 --> 03:11:43.982]  Just like that person at that, what was it, a legislative meeting, and there was a photo of that anti-gun person's cell phone where they were texting another person to say, yeah, I'm going to shoot these NRA people, I'm going to shoot these lawmakers, something like that.
[03:11:43.982 --> 03:11:46.604]  They are not afraid to use guns to murder you.
[03:11:46.604 --> 03:11:54.109]  In fact, hear me on this, the only reason the radical left is not committing mass genocide
[03:11:54.870 --> 03:12:01.212]  And a mass slaughter of Christians and conservatives right now is because it's Christians and conservatives that have the guns.
[03:12:01.212 --> 03:12:14.095]  If you were disarmed right now, they would already have armies of radical leftists sweeping across the country, pulling people out of their homes and slaughtering you with the guns that they monopolize.
[03:12:14.095 --> 03:12:16.436]  And that's the whole point of gun control.
[03:12:16.436 --> 03:12:21.297]  And Hawaii lawmakers are now pushing to repeal the Second Amendment.
[03:12:21.297 --> 03:12:24.318]  And you've got conservatives now in Washington, D.C.
[03:12:25.638 --> 03:12:30.782]  Conservative lawmakers who are all in favor of these red flag laws now, which are unconstitutional.
[03:12:30.782 --> 03:12:32.784]  I mean, they violate due process.
[03:12:32.784 --> 03:12:47.535]  They violate the Bill of Rights to take away your guns just by someone reporting that you might be a suspicious person or they don't like what you're doing in your garage in the neighborhood because you're cleaning a rifle or something, minding your own business, and they don't like you.
[03:12:47.535 --> 03:12:53.380]  Some neighborhood watch Nazi liberal comes along and says, oh, I saw that I saw him with ammo cans.
[03:12:53.380 --> 03:12:54.501]  He has ammo cans.
[03:12:55.598 --> 03:12:58.520]  As if owning legal ammunition is some kind of a crime?
[03:12:58.520 --> 03:13:01.142]  Well, it is now, thanks to red flag laws.
[03:13:01.142 --> 03:13:09.468]  You've got Democrats and now an increasing number of conservatives who are pushing to take away your guns and to create gun registries.
[03:13:09.468 --> 03:13:13.491]  You must oppose this with every fiber of your being.
[03:13:13.491 --> 03:13:15.512]  And it's happening.
[03:13:15.512 --> 03:13:17.394]  We now have the rise of gun sanctuaries.
[03:13:18.092 --> 03:13:19.253]  Gun sanctuaries.
[03:13:19.253 --> 03:13:23.915]  This is the answer to the radical left and their illegal immigration sanctuaries.
[03:13:23.915 --> 03:13:25.656]  So the left set the precedent.
[03:13:25.656 --> 03:13:32.479]  They said that we can choose to oppose federal laws in whatever cities or whatever states we want.
[03:13:33.075 --> 03:13:36.157]  And we'll just say that we're not going to abide by the laws that we don't like.
[03:13:36.157 --> 03:13:37.318]  Sanctuary cities.
[03:13:37.318 --> 03:13:38.999]  Sanctuary states like California.
[03:13:38.999 --> 03:13:40.540]  Well, guess what?
[03:13:40.540 --> 03:13:40.980]  You know what?
[03:13:40.980 --> 03:13:42.701]  Gun rights people can do the same thing.
[03:13:42.701 --> 03:13:50.125]  And sheriffs in conservative counties in rural Washington and rural Oregon and rural California or New Mexico or Arizona for that matter.
[03:13:50.125 --> 03:13:52.647]  They can say, look, this is a gun sanctuary.
[03:13:52.647 --> 03:13:53.007]  Texas.
[03:13:53.007 --> 03:14:01.752]  There's been a law proposed now to make the entire state of Texas a gun sanctuary to nullify all federal laws regarding guns in Texas.
[03:14:01.752 --> 03:14:02.573]  Can't wait for that one.
[03:14:03.522 --> 03:14:07.903]  I could use a couple more suppressors, you know, but I'm joking.
[03:14:07.903 --> 03:14:08.663]  I've got money.
[03:14:08.663 --> 03:14:11.284]  But the thing is, this is happening.
[03:14:11.284 --> 03:14:17.286]  So we have this bifurcation now that where we've got conservatives saying we're going to have a conservative sanctuary.
[03:14:17.286 --> 03:14:25.948]  We've got liberals saying we're going to have a liberal sanctuary of total lawlessness and total invasion and occupation of America with illegals who, by the way, are carrying infectious disease.
[03:14:25.948 --> 03:14:30.709]  That's why we have measles outbreaks across America is because the illegals are bringing it in.
[03:14:30.709 --> 03:14:32.610]  That's an undeniable truth.
[03:14:33.604 --> 03:14:41.366]  But this is how we end up in a breakup of America, a civil war at both the state level and the national level.
[03:14:41.366 --> 03:14:49.047]  When the two sides say, we're just not going to abide by the laws that we don't like, then you get a two-tiered nation.
[03:14:49.047 --> 03:14:53.348]  And with the upcoming election in 2020, it's going to be the same thing.
[03:14:53.348 --> 03:14:55.008]  One side is going to say, we don't recognize Trump.
[03:14:55.008 --> 03:14:57.369]  The other side is going to say, we do recognize Trump.
[03:14:57.369 --> 03:14:58.909]  And there you can break out into a civil war.
[03:14:58.909 --> 03:15:02.510]  But just to wrap this up about Venezuela, learn the lessons.
[03:15:03.160 --> 03:15:08.023]  That votes have consequences, elections have consequences, as Obama said.
[03:15:08.023 --> 03:15:12.926]  And if you elect socialists, you will be eating your neighbor in ten years.
[03:15:12.926 --> 03:15:16.589]  Or maybe not you in particular, but the American masses.
[03:15:16.589 --> 03:15:18.810]  The clueless liberals who live in the cities.
[03:15:18.810 --> 03:15:26.655]  They will be roasting their neighbors over an open fire and slicing off a chunk of thigh so that they don't starve to death.
[03:15:26.655 --> 03:15:28.256]  Because that's where socialism leads.
[03:15:28.863 --> 03:15:31.444]  That's where the Ocasio-Cortez Green New Deal leads.
[03:15:31.444 --> 03:15:48.329]  Mass starvation, mass collapse, and if you don't oppose this and you don't stop it, it will destroy your nation, it will destroy your life, and you will end up begging for food or literally eating zoo animals, pets, and neighbors just to not die.
[03:15:48.329 --> 03:15:50.550]  That's where socialism leads.
[03:15:50.550 --> 03:15:51.330]  Much more straight ahead.
[03:15:53.326 --> 03:15:59.968]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[03:15:59.968 --> 03:16:04.669]  Did you know the official national American flag has never been manufactured for retail stores?
[03:16:04.669 --> 03:16:06.970]  The one that Americans fought and died for.
[03:16:06.970 --> 03:16:09.771]  The one symbol that represents our Constitution.
[03:16:09.771 --> 03:16:13.212]  Now you can be a part of this great movement that's never been seen before.
[03:16:13.212 --> 03:16:15.513]  Together we'll recapture America.

[03:16:23.215 --> 03:16:29.556]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.556 --> 03:16:32.597]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.597 --> 03:16:38.518]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.518 --> 03:16:42.319]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.319 --> 03:16:43.579]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.579 --> 03:16:44.919]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.919 --> 03:16:51.121]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:51.121 --> 03:16:52.561]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:53.251 --> 03:16:56.833]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:17:57.607 --> 03:18:00.610]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.

[03:18:07.478 --> 03:18:08.619]  X2 is back.
[03:18:08.619 --> 03:18:09.420]  We got it.
[03:18:09.420 --> 03:18:11.082]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[03:18:11.082 --> 03:18:12.684]  We rushed it into production.
[03:18:12.684 --> 03:18:13.465]  It's been bottled.
[03:18:13.465 --> 03:18:15.147]  The labels are being put on today.
[03:18:15.447 --> 03:18:15.647]  I think?
[03:18:36.701 --> 03:18:40.825]  The good halogens, you have the bad halogens at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:18:42.047 --> 03:18:43.288]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:18:43.288 --> 03:18:44.850]  They should write the supplements.
[03:18:44.850 --> 03:18:48.013]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:18:48.013 --> 03:18:49.935]  It is X2 Original.

[03:19:57.330 --> 03:20:10.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.442 --> 03:20:17.148]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:20:17.148 --> 03:20:19.450]  It's Mike Adams.
[03:20:19.450 --> 03:20:22.272]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:25.771 --> 03:20:28.532]  You want to know where the tech giant censorship is going?
[03:20:28.532 --> 03:20:29.772]  Pay attention here.
[03:20:29.772 --> 03:20:33.873]  You're going to be shocked at the information I've learned about what's next.
[03:20:33.873 --> 03:20:36.674]  Now, let's backtrack a little bit and look at the history of this.
[03:20:36.674 --> 03:20:38.954]  Of course, a Democrat, Rep.
[03:20:38.954 --> 03:20:41.535]  Adam Schiff, of course, he's a Democrat from California.
[03:20:41.535 --> 03:20:45.716]  He, no doubt, was given instructions by the vaccine deep state.
[03:20:46.357 --> 03:20:49.978]  Now, that's what I, that's the name I give to this.
[03:20:49.978 --> 03:20:58.141]  It's the vaccine manufacturers, it's the CDC, it's even, you know, corrupt researchers, people who got bribery money.
[03:20:58.141 --> 03:21:02.442]  The vaccine industry even has, there's a guy who's wanted by the US government who fled to Europe.
[03:21:02.982 --> 03:21:07.844]  Uh, because he was given millions of dollars in vaccine research grants.
[03:21:07.844 --> 03:21:11.385]  He faked all the research, took the money, and fled the country.
[03:21:11.385 --> 03:21:17.007]  His last name is Thorsen, by the way, T-H-O-R-S-E-N, if you want to research that.
[03:21:17.007 --> 03:21:20.188]  We've got stories about that up on the vaccines.news.
[03:21:20.188 --> 03:21:21.729]  But the vaccine deep state
[03:21:22.461 --> 03:21:33.004]  Told Adam Schiff, I have no doubt, to go pressure Facebook and Google and Twitter and everybody to just start banning all the voices of vaccine skeptics, whom they call anti-vaxxers.
[03:21:33.004 --> 03:21:40.447]  Now, according to them, an anti-vaxxer is someone who tells the truth about ingredients that are in vaccines.
[03:21:40.447 --> 03:21:44.268]  It's someone who quotes the CDC's own admissions that vaccines are dangerous.
[03:21:45.308 --> 03:22:02.398]  It's someone who quotes the vaccine insert sheet in the vaccines themselves that say there are risks and that, you know, these vaccines can cause seizures, you know, febrile seizures, hospitalization, comas, paralyzing children, and even in some cases death.
[03:22:02.398 --> 03:22:07.641]  If you quote HHS, that's Health and Human Services, statistics about vaccine damage,
[03:22:08.334 --> 03:22:15.239]  That's released by the VAERS database, V-A-E-R-S dot H-H-S dot gov, then you are called an anti-vaxxer.
[03:22:15.239 --> 03:22:20.943]  You are now censored and banned by Facebook and Google and YouTube and Twitter.
[03:22:20.943 --> 03:22:22.144]  Where is this going, though?
[03:22:22.144 --> 03:22:24.146]  Are they going to stop with vaccines?
[03:22:24.146 --> 03:22:25.086]  Of course not.
[03:22:25.086 --> 03:22:26.487]  Of course not.
[03:22:26.487 --> 03:22:30.130]  And what's next is anti-cancer foods.
[03:22:31.957 --> 03:22:34.138]  There was an article in the Wall Street Journal a couple of weeks ago.
[03:22:34.138 --> 03:22:35.399]  I don't recall the title of it.
[03:22:35.399 --> 03:22:48.926]  But the Wall Street Journal was saying that, well, Pinterest, yeah, they banned vaccine searches because, what, 80% of the information on Pinterest was warning parents about the dangers of vaccines, especially multiple vaccines given to children at a very young age.
[03:22:48.926 --> 03:22:57.810]  But the Wall Street Journal argues, the article seemed to be arguing that now you should ban anti-cancer food information, like anti-cancer recipes.
[03:22:57.810 --> 03:22:59.231]  And they were saying that, well, there's no proof.
[03:22:59.867 --> 03:23:02.712]  That there's such a thing as an anti-cancer food.
[03:23:02.712 --> 03:23:03.895]  Really?
[03:23:03.895 --> 03:23:07.141]  Give me a break, because, you know, I'm a food science researcher.
[03:23:07.141 --> 03:23:09.225]  We cover anti-cancer foods every day.
[03:23:10.074 --> 03:23:21.545]  I mean, there's resveratrol in red grapes, there's apigenin in celery, there's anti-cancer nutrients in all citrus fruit, anti-cancer nutrients in turmeric root and ginger root and garlic.
[03:23:21.545 --> 03:23:32.036]  In fact, almost every fresh fruit or vegetable or nut or seed that you can pick up in the grocery store has at least some kind of anti-cancer effect, almost without exception.
[03:23:32.788 --> 03:23:34.029]  I mean, it's astonishing.
[03:23:34.029 --> 03:23:37.752]  Now, if you get into processed foods, yeah, they're not anti-cancer, they're pro-cancer.
[03:23:37.752 --> 03:23:45.118]  But the fresh fruits and vegetables, almost all of them, the cruciferous vegetables, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, kale, broccoli.
[03:23:45.118 --> 03:23:49.241]  Broccoli contains sulforaphane, a potent anti-cancer nutrient.
[03:23:49.241 --> 03:23:58.448]  But you see, the tech giants are now going to say, you're banned if you talk about anti-cancer nutrients, because that's not approved by the, quote, authoritative sources.
[03:23:58.448 --> 03:23:59.809]  And who are the authoritative sources?
[03:24:00.546 --> 03:24:09.713]  Well of course, it's the pharma-corrupted FDA, the pharma-corrupted World Health Organization, the pharma-corrupted CDC, the pharma-corrupted cancer industry.
[03:24:09.713 --> 03:24:17.158]  So if you then say that cancer can be prevented by a diet and a lifestyle,
[03:24:17.910 --> 03:24:20.771]  You're going to be banned just like the vaccine skeptics are being banned.
[03:24:20.771 --> 03:24:31.333]  Or if you say that chemotherapy is toxic, makes your hair fall out, makes you lose muscle mass, it causes chemo brain, it damages your kidneys, your liver, your heart, and your brain.
[03:24:31.333 --> 03:24:34.594]  If you say that, even though it's factually true, you're going to be banned.
[03:24:34.594 --> 03:24:37.155]  Because they're going to use the same argument that they've used now with vaccines.
[03:24:37.155 --> 03:24:42.996]  They're going to say, well, you're causing people to avoid medical treatment.
[03:24:42.996 --> 03:24:44.197]  They need to have medical treatment.
[03:24:44.197 --> 03:24:44.777]  They need to have
[03:24:45.464 --> 03:25:01.709]  Toxic chemotherapy dripped into their veins so that the cancer industry can make another couple of million dollars off that person while they're wasting away sitting there being poisoned by basically chemical weapons derived from mustard gas used in World War I. Where do you think chemotherapy came from?
[03:25:01.709 --> 03:25:04.389]  It was a weapon system in the First World War.
[03:25:04.389 --> 03:25:11.111]  They just modified those chemicals to kill you from the inside instead of from the outside.
[03:25:11.111 --> 03:25:13.492]  It's basically the same class of chemicals.
[03:25:14.358 --> 03:25:21.626]  If you say, oh no, you should take vitamin C or vitamin D or zinc or just eat healthier foods or grill your own sprouts.
[03:25:21.626 --> 03:25:23.388]  Sprouts have anti-cancer nutrients.
[03:25:23.388 --> 03:25:25.591]  If you say any of that, you're going to be banned.
[03:25:25.591 --> 03:25:27.233]  But guess what?
[03:25:27.233 --> 03:25:29.075]  That's not the end of it.
[03:25:29.075 --> 03:25:29.896]  They're going to go after...
[03:25:30.896 --> 03:25:34.198]  Health advice, food advice, and nutrition advice.
[03:25:34.198 --> 03:25:45.343]  Because you see, the drug giants, which control the legislature in the United States Congress, every person there, including Adam Schiff, has taken money from the drug giants.
[03:25:45.343 --> 03:25:46.624]  I think almost without exception.
[03:25:46.624 --> 03:25:50.026]  There might be a couple, maybe Rand Paul hasn't, I'm not sure.
[03:25:50.026 --> 03:25:55.088]  But by and large, everybody in Washington is owned by the pharmaceutical giants.
[03:25:55.088 --> 03:25:59.791]  And those drug giants, they depend on people getting sick for their revenues.
[03:26:00.521 --> 03:26:04.822]  If you avoid needing a drug, they lose revenue.
[03:26:04.822 --> 03:26:24.049]  So if you go to my website or any other website that talks about anti-cancer foods, or that talks about nutrition, talks about preventing disease, talks about longevity, drink clean water, eat healthy foods, eat anti-cancer foods, learn about the value of superfoods and certain nutrients,
[03:26:25.097 --> 03:26:31.782]  And, you know, here's how to make food, recipes, using raw foods that have anti-cancer effects and so on.
[03:26:31.782 --> 03:26:41.568]  That takes money away from the pharmaceutical giants that depend on sickness and disease to continue to profit in this country.
[03:26:41.568 --> 03:26:47.693]  Almost one quarter of the United States economy now depends on keeping people sick.
[03:26:47.693 --> 03:26:48.673]  It's no joke.
[03:26:48.673 --> 03:26:49.174]  The GDP
[03:26:50.140 --> 03:26:57.305]  The amount that's spent on so-called health care is between 20 and 25 percent, and it continues to grow.
[03:26:57.305 --> 03:27:05.170]  That's because the drug giants and the health, I'm sorry, the medical device manufacturers and the cancer industry pushers and the vaccine pushers.
[03:27:05.170 --> 03:27:09.613]  The reason all these treatments are toxic is because they need you to stay sick.
[03:27:09.613 --> 03:27:10.854]  It's called repeat business.
[03:27:10.854 --> 03:27:12.475]  It's their revenue model.
[03:27:12.475 --> 03:27:14.957]  It's their entire business practice.
[03:27:14.957 --> 03:27:18.139]  They can't help you get well because they'll lose you as a customer.
[03:27:19.019 --> 03:27:26.261]  And when you take advantage of healthy products, I mean, think about just think about some of the things that the Infowars store offers.
[03:27:26.261 --> 03:27:31.643]  I mean, I can't make specific claims due to FTC and FDA regulations, and I'm not making specific claims.
[03:27:31.643 --> 03:27:42.126]  But if you do your research on nutrients and you do your research on herbs and powerful, potent extracts of foods and superfoods and certain minerals,
[03:27:42.924 --> 03:27:47.991]  You will find that preventing disease is so much more affordable.
[03:27:47.991 --> 03:27:51.035]  It costs a fraction of treating disease.
[03:27:51.035 --> 03:27:53.918]  And you see, that destroys Big Pharma's business model.
[03:27:53.918 --> 03:27:55.581]  But the censorship is going to get much worse.
[03:27:55.581 --> 03:27:58.845]  They're going to come after you for telling people to eat healthy.
[03:27:59.480 --> 03:28:03.305]  They're going to come after you for telling people, filter your water, don't drink tap water.
[03:28:03.305 --> 03:28:05.268]  That will get you banned in the future.
[03:28:05.268 --> 03:28:10.074]  They're going to come after you for everything that you say that helps people stay healthy.
[03:28:10.074 --> 03:28:15.722]  You know, exercise, get off your butt, don't live a sedentary lifestyle, get some vitamin D and some sunshine.
[03:28:16.454 --> 03:28:18.615]  Sprout some foods and eat some raw sprouts.
[03:28:18.615 --> 03:28:20.116]  All these things will be banned.
[03:28:20.116 --> 03:28:21.357]  And they've already set the precedent.
[03:28:21.357 --> 03:28:23.658]  They started with banning Alex Jones.
[03:28:23.658 --> 03:28:25.679]  They banned me, the health ranger.
[03:28:25.679 --> 03:28:30.082]  And now they're going to ban everybody who talks about healthy living.
[03:28:30.082 --> 03:28:30.822]  It's coming.
[03:28:30.822 --> 03:28:32.243]  This is no joke.
[03:28:32.243 --> 03:28:38.827]  They cannot stand the American people being healthy and having good cognitive function and having working immune systems.
[03:28:38.827 --> 03:28:41.288]  They have to keep you weak and diseased.
[03:28:41.846 --> 03:28:48.822]  And paying money at their corrupt system that never offers any cures and no solutions for health.
[03:28:48.822 --> 03:28:49.744]  That's the truth.
[03:28:49.744 --> 03:28:50.646]  Stay with us.
[03:28:50.646 --> 03:28:51.368]  We're going to break.

[03:30:08.041 --> 03:30:09.442]  This is high-end.
[03:30:09.442 --> 03:30:12.723]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.
[03:30:12.723 --> 03:30:16.784]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[03:30:17.404 --> 03:30:26.292]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.

[03:30:51.754 --> 03:30:52.855]  It's that simple.

[03:31:54.124 --> 03:32:07.550]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most oppressed.
[03:32:07.550 --> 03:32:18.596]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[03:32:19.890 --> 03:32:21.817]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:32:21.817 --> 03:32:24.506]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:32:25.848 --> 03:32:30.190]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:32:30.190 --> 03:32:34.451]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[03:32:34.451 --> 03:32:36.732]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:32:36.732 --> 03:32:39.053]  This country is in a war!
[03:32:39.053 --> 03:32:49.737]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:32:49.737 --> 03:32:53.318]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[03:32:57.276 --> 03:33:08.125]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:08.125 --> 03:33:10.527]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:10.527 --> 03:33:14.411]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:33:19.991 --> 03:33:23.212]  I've got a message today for President Trump.
[03:33:23.212 --> 03:33:26.833]  I've been talking to a lot of people across the independent media.
[03:33:26.833 --> 03:33:35.496]  As you're aware, you know, InfoWars and MyOperationNaturalNews, we have a lot of contacts and we know basically everybody across the industry.
[03:33:35.496 --> 03:33:39.277]  And I've decided to go ahead and share this publicly.
[03:33:39.277 --> 03:33:46.199]  President Trump, the independent media is very, very close to running out of patience.
[03:33:47.399 --> 03:33:54.364]  Very close to turning against you, essentially, if you don't deal with the censorship issue.
[03:33:54.364 --> 03:33:58.867]  You've heard the talk now for over two years.
[03:33:58.867 --> 03:34:09.114]  The independent media is being selectively censored, illegally censored, by the tech giants that are violating Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the CDA.
[03:34:09.881 --> 03:34:16.506]  They're acting as editorial publishers, and yet they claim to have legal immunity against all content under Section 230.
[03:34:16.506 --> 03:34:19.309]  Well, you can't have both.
[03:34:19.309 --> 03:34:23.152]  It's either an open and free platform where everybody can speak.
[03:34:23.152 --> 03:34:24.993]  That's how you get the legal immunity.
[03:34:24.993 --> 03:34:32.700]  Or if you're going to have selective publishing and editorializing, then you're responsible for your content.
[03:34:32.700 --> 03:34:37.804]  And it's time President Trump and all the staffers who have contact with President Trump
[03:34:38.422 --> 03:34:51.727]  It's time to order William Barr to criminally prosecute these tech giants for their massive, widespread violations of law and also violations of basic civil rights of the American people.
[03:34:51.727 --> 03:34:53.327]  The American people are being stifled.
[03:34:53.327 --> 03:34:55.348]  Their voices are being silenced.
[03:34:55.348 --> 03:35:03.691]  And it's all selective based on their politics, or even if they talk about vaccine hazards, like I talk about.
[03:35:03.691 --> 03:35:04.891]  We are being censored.
[03:35:04.891 --> 03:35:06.592]  Christian voices are being censored.
[03:35:07.389 --> 03:35:09.410]  Pastors are being cut off.
[03:35:09.410 --> 03:35:15.112]  You can't quote Bible scripture now without being silenced by all these tech giants.
[03:35:15.112 --> 03:35:20.435]  And then they go before Congress and they lie and they claim, well, we're not censoring anybody based on politics.
[03:35:20.435 --> 03:35:23.196]  Oh, and then they censored Zero Hedge just the other day.
[03:35:23.196 --> 03:35:27.098]  And then when there was a big outcry about that, they say, oh, we made a mistake.
[03:35:27.098 --> 03:35:28.918]  Well, they just censor anybody they want.
[03:35:28.918 --> 03:35:32.820]  And occasionally they reverse it when there's a big enough outcry.
[03:35:32.820 --> 03:35:34.521]  But what they are doing is illegal.
[03:35:35.447 --> 03:35:38.749]  And it's time to start prosecuting these companies.
[03:35:38.749 --> 03:35:39.829]  This is the thing.
[03:35:39.829 --> 03:35:48.093]  President Trump, if you do not start prosecuting and start pushing back against these tech giants, it's not just Twitter.
[03:35:48.093 --> 03:35:50.955]  And you saw the interview on Joe Rogan Experience there.
[03:35:51.733 --> 03:35:53.033]  It's not just Facebook.
[03:35:53.033 --> 03:35:54.814]  It's also Pinterest.
[03:35:54.814 --> 03:35:56.674]  It's also Google Search, by the way.
[03:35:56.674 --> 03:35:58.294]  It's Google News.
[03:35:58.294 --> 03:35:59.975]  It's all these tech companies.
[03:35:59.975 --> 03:36:01.115]  It's YouTube.
[03:36:01.115 --> 03:36:05.236]  If you don't start pushing back, number one, you're going to lose the election.
[03:36:05.236 --> 03:36:06.236]  No question about it.
[03:36:06.236 --> 03:36:12.437]  And number two, you're going to lose the independent media that got you elected in the first place.
[03:36:12.437 --> 03:36:14.038]  And you know, I don't say this is a threat.
[03:36:14.038 --> 03:36:20.639]  I mean, I've been a Trump supporter from day one, and we have given President Trump a lot of leeway, and we've had a lot of patience.
[03:36:21.599 --> 03:36:35.870]  Even when the president put some very questionable people in power, such as Jeff Sessions, who turned out to be an absolute traitor, who stood by and let the deep state run roughshod over our democracy, our republic.
[03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:41.234]  Jeff Sessions was in there because President Trump nominated him.
[03:36:41.234 --> 03:36:45.717]  And there were other people like that who turned out to be disasters.
[03:36:45.717 --> 03:36:50.941]  We are asserting this right now that President Trump
[03:36:51.835 --> 03:36:53.895]  You are important for this country.
[03:36:53.895 --> 03:37:03.017]  There's almost a divine reason why you were chosen to have this power in this time.
[03:37:03.017 --> 03:37:10.998]  But if you don't use that power, if you don't express your purpose for being there, then all is lost.
[03:37:10.998 --> 03:37:14.739]  And your purpose for being there is not to get along with the opposition.
[03:37:14.739 --> 03:37:17.860]  It's not to make friends in Washington.
[03:37:17.860 --> 03:37:19.800]  If I dare say, your purpose in being there is to
[03:37:21.272 --> 03:37:25.933]  To tear down that corrupt system, to prosecute the deep state criminals.
[03:37:25.933 --> 03:37:30.414]  You need to, in my opinion, demand that the Department of Justice prosecute these people.
[03:37:30.414 --> 03:37:34.215]  Demand that William Barr go after these deep state criminals.
[03:37:34.215 --> 03:37:40.396]  You need to, in my opinion, release the previously classified documents on the FISA warrants.
[03:37:40.396 --> 03:37:45.937]  Release the documents that show the deep state criminality and even the Obama complicity
[03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:52.656]  In spying illegally on American citizens who were associated with your campaign, President Trump.
[03:37:52.656 --> 03:37:58.321]  If you don't do these things, you will lose the election, but we will also lose our country.
[03:37:58.321 --> 03:38:08.069]  And I fear that if that happens, things will very quickly break down into an actual violent civil war scenario following the 2020 election.
[03:38:08.069 --> 03:38:11.873]  If Trump loses that election, I have a very strong feeling
[03:38:12.529 --> 03:38:22.254]  That the Patriots and the Christians and the independent media journalists are all going to conclude correctly that the Democrats stole the election.
[03:38:22.254 --> 03:38:37.422]  And we are probably going to end up saying that that's an illegitimate election because you have so much massive voter fraud, you have the popular vote compact now being pushed by leftists, you have illegals voting in California, and you have suppression of speech.
[03:38:38.320 --> 03:38:39.581]  Of conservatives.
[03:38:39.581 --> 03:38:46.065]  How can you have fair and free elections in a society where you can't debate ideas in the online public square?
[03:38:47.068 --> 03:38:58.776]  What Twitter is doing in banning me and banning Alex Jones and banning all the important voices, what YouTube and Google and Facebook are doing in this selective banning is they are stealing the election.
[03:38:58.776 --> 03:39:00.097]  This is election meddling.
[03:39:00.097 --> 03:39:01.198]  This is a crime.
[03:39:01.198 --> 03:39:02.959]  These are criminal offenses.
[03:39:02.959 --> 03:39:06.101]  This is conspiracy to commit election fraud.
[03:39:06.101 --> 03:39:12.205]  And I find it fascinating that Robert Mueller charged Russian companies with that exact crime.
[03:39:12.205 --> 03:39:14.427]  Conspiracy to interfere with America's elections.
[03:39:15.047 --> 03:39:23.792]  Even though there was scant evidence that anything had happened, maybe $100,000 worth of ads run on Facebook by some Russia-linked companies, that's it.
[03:39:23.792 --> 03:39:30.375]  I'm talking about billions of dollars worth of election meddling now being carried out by the tech giants.
[03:39:30.375 --> 03:39:43.122]  When they silence conservative voices, and they only allow the pro-Clinton voices, or the pro-AOC voices, or the liberal Democrat voices to be heard, that is election meddling on a massive scale.
[03:39:44.187 --> 03:39:50.051]  And I'm almost at the point where I might launch a meme on this called, No Speech, No Consent.
[03:39:50.051 --> 03:39:54.533]  If you don't give us our speech, we don't consent to you winning the election.
[03:39:54.533 --> 03:39:57.535]  Because without speech, you can't have debates.
[03:39:57.535 --> 03:40:00.197]  And without debates, you don't have a democracy.
[03:40:00.197 --> 03:40:06.300]  You don't have fair and free elections if you don't have the right to speak and to have your voices heard.
[03:40:06.300 --> 03:40:13.705]  The tech giants are engaged in election meddling at a scale that has never been witnessed before in the history of our civilization, in the history of our nation.
[03:40:14.838 --> 03:40:27.468]  And Trump is, it looks like Trump is doing nothing on this issue, and it's incomprehensible to those of us in the independent media, even those of us who supported Trump and voted for Trump.
[03:40:27.468 --> 03:40:33.233]  Why, President Trump, why aren't you ordering executive orders to deal with this?
[03:40:33.233 --> 03:40:37.577]  Why aren't you ordering the tech giants to respect freedom of speech?
[03:40:37.577 --> 03:40:43.742]  Why aren't you invoking the DOJ to go after them, or the FTC, antitrust action, to go after them?
[03:40:44.998 --> 03:40:48.161]  I mean, the President even has the power to seize private corporations.
[03:40:48.161 --> 03:40:53.184]  I'm not saying that that would be the right tactic here, but you have that power.
[03:40:53.184 --> 03:41:00.730]  You could declare that these are public spaces, that this is part of the modern public infrastructure, which Twitter arguably is.
[03:41:00.730 --> 03:41:09.056]  Why does one man, the CEO of Twitter, why does he have the power to determine who gets to speak and who gets silenced in America?
[03:41:09.056 --> 03:41:10.097]  Why?
[03:41:10.097 --> 03:41:11.678]  Why are we living in that kind of society?
[03:41:11.678 --> 03:41:12.479]  An unelected
[03:41:13.340 --> 03:41:15.121]  Someone who has zero transparency.
[03:41:15.121 --> 03:41:17.122]  Their algorithms are all secret.
[03:41:17.122 --> 03:41:19.743]  They never answer to the voters.
[03:41:19.743 --> 03:41:22.105]  And they're not being prosecuted.
[03:41:22.105 --> 03:41:23.265]  They need to be broken up.
[03:41:23.265 --> 03:41:24.186]  And you know what?
[03:41:24.186 --> 03:41:34.731]  Elizabeth Warren, as much as she should be condemned for declaring herself to be an Indian, when she really wasn't, she's right about this point.
[03:41:34.731 --> 03:41:36.632]  That the tech giants need to be broken up.
[03:41:36.632 --> 03:41:39.814]  And a big question that I have today is, why is Elizabeth Warren
[03:41:40.825 --> 03:41:44.947]  The only prominent voice out there saying break up these tech giants.
[03:41:44.947 --> 03:41:47.429]  Where are the conservatives on this issue?
[03:41:47.429 --> 03:41:48.750]  Where is President Trump?
[03:41:48.750 --> 03:41:51.992]  Where are the conservative senators on this issue?
[03:41:51.992 --> 03:41:54.713]  Elizabeth Warren is correct on this.
[03:41:54.713 --> 03:42:05.640]  And by the way, just as a side note, Ilhan Omar is also correct in saying that Obama was a pretty face for murdering people that he wanted to murder around the world.
[03:42:05.640 --> 03:42:07.721]  She was actually correct in saying that.
[03:42:08.362 --> 03:42:11.784]  You know, not everything that these Democrats say is wrong.
[03:42:11.784 --> 03:42:13.765]  Their core principles are wrong.
[03:42:13.765 --> 03:42:15.285]  Socialism is wrong.
[03:42:15.285 --> 03:42:20.248]  But every once in a while, there's something that is just spot-on, absolutely true.
[03:42:20.248 --> 03:42:23.409]  And of course, the Democrat Party, you know, tried to put her back in her place.
[03:42:23.409 --> 03:42:27.571]  Don't talk about Obama like that, because she happened to utter the truth.
[03:42:27.571 --> 03:42:31.373]  For a moment, we got a glimpse of the truth out of the mouth of Omar.
[03:42:31.373 --> 03:42:34.195]  We got a glimpse of truth out of the mouth of Warren.
[03:42:34.195 --> 03:42:36.376]  The tech giants need to be broken up.
[03:42:36.376 --> 03:42:36.916]  If they don't,
[03:42:37.580 --> 03:42:39.301]  This country is gone.
[03:42:39.301 --> 03:42:42.842]  They will destroy America with online fascism.
[03:42:42.842 --> 03:42:47.864]  All speech that they don't like will be wiped out, silenced forever and we will lose the future of our country.
[03:42:47.864 --> 03:42:49.725]  President Trump, get on this.
[03:42:49.725 --> 03:42:53.246]  We're with you to take action.
[03:42:53.246 --> 03:42:54.587]  I've got some really good news though.
[03:42:55.706 --> 03:42:57.087]  X2's back.
[03:42:57.087 --> 03:42:58.848]  The original X2.
[03:42:58.848 --> 03:42:59.809]  Deep Earth Crystal.
[03:42:59.809 --> 03:43:01.770]  Pure atomic iodine.
[03:43:01.770 --> 03:43:02.851]  What you want.
[03:43:02.851 --> 03:43:03.971]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:03.971 --> 03:43:05.412]  It'll be here in a week.
[03:43:05.412 --> 03:43:06.953]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[03:43:06.953 --> 03:43:07.934]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:07.934 --> 03:43:09.735]  With the best iodine in the world.
[03:43:09.735 --> 03:43:10.875]  X2, it's available.
[03:43:10.875 --> 03:43:11.856]  I thought X3's great.
[03:43:11.856 --> 03:43:14.077]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source.
[03:43:14.077 --> 03:43:15.879]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[03:43:15.879 --> 03:43:16.799]  The scientists that do that.
[03:43:16.799 --> 03:43:19.041]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[03:43:19.881 --> 03:43:24.244]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[03:43:24.244 --> 03:43:28.347]  We now have X2 again, and in fullmorestore.com, so hallelujah!
[03:43:28.347 --> 03:43:40.035]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[03:43:40.035 --> 03:43:48.641]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,

[03:44:39.569 --> 03:44:42.092]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.

[03:44:54.187 --> 03:44:56.449]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:44:56.449 --> 03:44:58.190]  There is no set stasis.
[03:44:58.190 --> 03:44:59.431]  There is no managed system.
[03:44:59.431 --> 03:45:01.072]  There is no un-continuum.
[03:45:01.072 --> 03:45:04.294]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[03:45:04.294 --> 03:45:07.656]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[03:45:07.656 --> 03:45:08.897]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[03:45:08.897 --> 03:45:09.698]  We'll be here forever.
[03:45:09.698 --> 03:45:10.939]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:45:10.939 --> 03:45:17.843]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[03:45:17.843 --> 03:45:18.404]  We made it.
[03:45:18.404 --> 03:45:20.565]  And that's really where this goes.
[03:45:20.565 --> 03:45:22.387]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[03:45:22.387 --> 03:45:22.747]  And so,
[03:45:22.947 --> 03:45:29.414]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[03:45:29.414 --> 03:45:34.479]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[03:45:34.479 --> 03:45:37.342]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:45:37.342 --> 03:45:39.724]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:45:39.724 --> 03:45:43.228]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[03:45:43.228 --> 03:45:44.269]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:45:44.510 --> 03:45:48.780]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[03:45:48.780 --> 03:45:51.687]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[03:45:51.687 --> 03:45:52.750]  I want life!
[03:45:52.750 --> 03:45:53.592]  I want Jesus!
[03:46:03.376 --> 03:46:12.380]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:46:12.380 --> 03:46:22.443]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:46:22.443 --> 03:46:30.987]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:46:31.827 --> 03:46:33.168]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:46:33.168 --> 03:46:34.329]  You must experience it.
[03:46:34.329 --> 03:46:36.410]  It is a total game-changer.
[03:46:36.410 --> 03:46:41.334]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you like.
[03:46:41.334 --> 03:46:42.835]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:46:42.835 --> 03:46:44.316]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:46:44.316 --> 03:46:51.021]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:46:51.021 --> 03:46:56.745]  TurboForce at m4slife.com.
[03:46:56.745 --> 03:46:59.367]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.745 --> 03:47:19.310]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:19.310 --> 03:47:24.815]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[03:47:24.815 --> 03:47:30.540]  The real goal of the Democrats is to fake all elections, but create the impression that they weren't fake.
[03:47:31.149 --> 03:47:40.474]  So to steal your democracy, well, your republic, and then to convince you that they didn't steal it so that they have this air of authority.
[03:47:40.474 --> 03:47:41.795]  This is really the way they operate.
[03:47:44.002 --> 03:47:46.584]  Being unveiled now in society is fake.
[03:47:46.584 --> 03:47:47.845]  So much of it is fraud.
[03:47:47.845 --> 03:47:53.990]  It's no surprise to all of us when we saw this college admissions scam, which was run by Democrats, by the way.
[03:47:53.990 --> 03:47:56.032]  You won't even see that reported in the media.
[03:47:56.032 --> 03:47:58.113]  They just say they were white people.
[03:47:58.113 --> 03:47:59.314]  You know, you got to blame white people.
[03:47:59.314 --> 03:48:02.677]  But they were white, rich Democrats.
[03:48:02.677 --> 03:48:04.799]  And of course they had to fake everything.
[03:48:04.799 --> 03:48:09.242]  They had to fake their way into college, just like they fake elections and they fake the news.
[03:48:09.242 --> 03:48:10.143]  They're faking everything.
[03:48:10.143 --> 03:48:12.365]  They're faking the science about climate change.
[03:48:12.365 --> 03:48:13.606]  Of course they're faking everything.
[03:48:14.429 --> 03:48:16.952]  And, you know, everything's becoming so fake.
[03:48:16.952 --> 03:48:19.155]  The fake hate crime hoaxes, all that.
[03:48:19.155 --> 03:48:20.817]  What if we just mix and match?
[03:48:20.817 --> 03:48:22.219]  You know, some of these, just combine them.
[03:48:22.219 --> 03:48:27.105]  What if Jussie Smollett hired white chicks to beat him up?
[03:48:27.105 --> 03:48:29.769]  White chicks that are on their way to college to beat him up.
[03:48:30.776 --> 03:48:33.018]  Put a Make America Great Again hat on him.
[03:48:33.018 --> 03:48:47.631]  I mean, if he's gonna hire somebody to beat him up, he could have at least found some white chicks and then he could have made a donation to that non-profit fraud scam thing so that they could get into college by faking like they're rowing team champions.
[03:48:47.631 --> 03:48:52.395]  With enough Photoshop, I guess you could turn anybody into an athlete.
[03:48:52.395 --> 03:48:54.517]  I think we should take like a UFC fighter.
[03:48:54.517 --> 03:48:56.259]  Like, what's his name, McGregor?
[03:48:57.250 --> 03:49:05.473]  And Photoshop some white chick's face on his body and just say, ah, this is the... She's on the transgender college wrestling team.
[03:49:05.473 --> 03:49:06.594]  Yeah, how about that?
[03:49:06.594 --> 03:49:08.395]  Get her into the college that way.
[03:49:08.395 --> 03:49:11.976]  And if you criticize that, you're full of hate, you see.
[03:49:11.976 --> 03:49:14.917]  If you criticize that, then you're going to be banned.
[03:49:14.917 --> 03:49:19.219]  Because Photoshop is now the new reality, according to leftists.
[03:49:19.219 --> 03:49:20.940]  It's all insane.
[03:49:20.940 --> 03:49:24.061]  But getting to some more serious issues here.
[03:49:24.061 --> 03:49:26.262]  A couple things I want to add to this censorship question.
[03:49:27.213 --> 03:49:40.841]  When you have Facebook now turning over censorship of all vaccine content to the vaccine industry, please understand this is corporate fascism because Facebook really functions as an extension of government.
[03:49:40.841 --> 03:49:43.503]  It's a government surveillance front end.
[03:49:43.503 --> 03:49:44.403]  They work with the government.
[03:49:44.403 --> 03:49:46.345]  It's a spy machine.
[03:49:46.345 --> 03:49:48.246]  And then the corporations control the content.
[03:49:48.246 --> 03:49:49.887]  Well, let me ask you this question.
[03:49:49.887 --> 03:49:56.651]  What if Facebook turned over policing of all content about smoking and cigarettes
[03:49:57.535 --> 03:49:59.336]  To Big Tobacco.
[03:49:59.336 --> 03:50:01.557]  Yeah, seriously, what if Facebook said, hey, R.J.
[03:50:01.557 --> 03:50:03.338]  Reynolds, come on in.
[03:50:03.338 --> 03:50:09.961]  We're going to let you decide what is authoritative speech on the cigarettes and smoking and tobacco.
[03:50:09.961 --> 03:50:12.383]  That's exactly what they did with the vaccine industry.
[03:50:12.383 --> 03:50:15.104]  I mean, and that would be insane.
[03:50:15.104 --> 03:50:18.346]  If Facebook says, well, who knows more about cigarettes than the tobacco companies?
[03:50:18.346 --> 03:50:19.226]  Yes, they're authoritative.
[03:50:20.188 --> 03:50:23.450]  Well, tobacco companies covered up the science on smoking for decades.
[03:50:23.450 --> 03:50:27.814]  You can go back to the Journal of the American Medical Association in the 1950s.
[03:50:27.814 --> 03:50:35.940]  They were bribed and paid off by the tobacco companies to run full-page ads that said, hey, doctors recommend camels more than any other cigarette.
[03:50:35.940 --> 03:50:39.803]  Doctors smiling and smoking, you know, and saying, yeah, this is good for your heart.
[03:50:39.803 --> 03:50:40.563]  Good for your lungs.
[03:50:40.563 --> 03:50:42.525]  It's good.
[03:50:42.525 --> 03:50:44.146]  That's what the vaccine industry is today.
[03:50:45.109 --> 03:50:46.090]  It's all good.
[03:50:46.090 --> 03:50:46.971]  The science.
[03:50:46.971 --> 03:50:48.613]  Don't worry about it, they say.
[03:50:48.613 --> 03:50:49.774]  There are no risks.
[03:50:49.774 --> 03:50:50.935]  Vaccines work all the time.
[03:50:50.935 --> 03:50:54.639]  And then Facebook says, yeah, you control the speech about vaccines.
[03:50:54.639 --> 03:50:55.660]  It's insane.
[03:50:55.660 --> 03:50:56.601]  Similar thing.
[03:50:56.601 --> 03:50:59.504]  Like, what about from the point of view of liberals?
[03:50:59.504 --> 03:51:06.991]  What if the big oil companies were put in charge of policing all online speech about global warming?
[03:51:06.991 --> 03:51:08.693]  How insane would leftists go?
[03:51:09.682 --> 03:51:23.431]  Literally, if you post a comment that says, you know, burning fossil fuels causes climate change, then you're banned for life because the oil companies are working with Facebook in this imaginary world, and they're banning you for that.
[03:51:23.431 --> 03:51:24.932]  That's what it would be like.
[03:51:24.932 --> 03:51:26.733]  Or Big Pharma.
[03:51:26.733 --> 03:51:29.715]  What if all health information were turned over to Big Pharma?
[03:51:29.715 --> 03:51:31.276]  That's essentially what's happening.
[03:51:31.276 --> 03:51:38.981]  The vaccine issue is the entryway, the doorway for them to establish that, to where you won't be able to talk about anything
[03:51:39.562 --> 03:51:46.489]  Without Big Pharma's complicity or permission would be a better way to say it.
[03:51:46.489 --> 03:51:51.954]  And these attacks on ideas and speech are so dangerous to our society.
[03:51:51.954 --> 03:51:54.597]  And I want to give a shout out to Tucker Carlson.
[03:51:54.597 --> 03:51:55.718]  He is very powerful.
[03:51:56.696 --> 03:52:09.681]  Video monologue just, I think it was yesterday or the day before, where he went after Media Matters and the SPLC and he exposed that how do they have this non-profit status when they are clearly a front for the Democrats.
[03:52:09.681 --> 03:52:11.942]  They are clearly political operatives.
[03:52:12.955 --> 03:52:23.581]  And then they put out targets of who they want to silence, and that's used by sometimes attorneys general in different states, or used by the tech giants to decide who to silence.
[03:52:23.581 --> 03:52:32.105]  And they go after Christian groups and Bible groups, and just people who talk about gender fluidity in a critical way.
[03:52:32.105 --> 03:52:37.428]  For example, people who say that biology counts, that there are only two genders, they get targeted.
[03:52:38.320 --> 03:52:41.523]  And so, Tucker Carlson nailed it!
[03:52:41.523 --> 03:52:53.015]  And Tucker Carlson refused to bow down and he refused to apologize for something that he said ten years ago on some comedy podcast, something that maybe he wouldn't say today.
[03:52:53.015 --> 03:52:56.219]  And he's right about this.
[03:52:56.219 --> 03:52:58.421]  And we need more people like Tucker Carlson to stand up.
[03:52:59.119 --> 03:53:04.563]  And to say, no, we're not apologizing for your fake hysteria campaign.
[03:53:04.563 --> 03:53:06.084]  We're not going to be silenced.
[03:53:06.084 --> 03:53:16.792]  Because I guarantee you, if you go through and you scrutinize every word that every person has ever said for the last 20 years, everybody has said something that they maybe wish they could rephrase.
[03:53:16.792 --> 03:53:21.555]  Everybody has said something, if taken out of context, sounds a little crazy.
[03:53:21.555 --> 03:53:26.458]  Everybody has said something that maybe on second thought they wouldn't have stated it the same way.
[03:53:26.458 --> 03:53:28.080]  Everybody!
[03:53:28.080 --> 03:53:28.600]  It's just that
[03:53:29.215 --> 03:53:32.937]  They selectively prosecute the people that they want to silence.
[03:53:32.937 --> 03:53:36.939]  And that's their form of online tyranny and control.
[03:53:36.939 --> 03:53:44.063]  And that's what's so dangerous about this, because when you have Facebook listening to these organizations, it's horrific.
[03:53:44.063 --> 03:53:47.825]  All right, last thought, because this is the final segment of today's show.
[03:53:47.825 --> 03:53:49.906]  Last thought.
[03:53:49.906 --> 03:53:53.448]  The collapse, it looks like it's coming.
[03:53:53.448 --> 03:53:57.690]  Just to be upfront and honest here, I don't think that
[03:53:59.594 --> 03:54:03.315]  I don't think that the tyranny of the tech giants is going to be stopped anytime soon.
[03:54:03.315 --> 03:54:07.417]  I don't think that the fraud of elections pushed by Democrats is going to be stopped.
[03:54:07.417 --> 03:54:11.818]  And I don't think that the illegal immigration is going to be stopped either.
[03:54:11.818 --> 03:54:28.984]  I think that America is being overrun by demonic, satanic forces, by radical communist forces, and by people who are brainwashed with so much hatred for America and for Trump and for the Constitution that they can no longer be reasoned with.
[03:54:29.713 --> 03:54:40.958]  And I want to put out a warning to everybody here, and I save this for the very end, a warning that don't rely on Trump to save you.
[03:54:40.958 --> 03:54:42.379]  He may still do some good.
[03:54:42.379 --> 03:54:47.281]  We're calling for him to go after the tech giants, but don't rely on him to save you.
[03:54:47.281 --> 03:54:51.543]  Don't rely on anybody in central authority to save you.
[03:54:51.543 --> 03:54:55.745]  It looks like we, the people, are going to have to save ourselves.
[03:54:55.745 --> 03:54:57.286]  We're going to have to save our own country.
[03:54:58.163 --> 03:55:12.906]  And although I'm not recommending any specific action items right now, my most important piece of advice to you is to be prepared, be ready to take action, because the future of our country belongs to those who are willing to take action.
[03:55:12.906 --> 03:55:20.087]  You've got Obama from his command bunker organizing what they call community organizing all across the country.
[03:55:20.087 --> 03:55:23.307]  They're going to be ready with teams of violent anti-terrorists.
[03:55:23.307 --> 03:55:24.908]  They're planning a mass uprising.
[03:55:24.908 --> 03:55:26.028]  They're planning violence.
[03:55:26.827 --> 03:55:31.389]  If we sit back and do nothing, we will be overrun and we will lose our country.
[03:55:31.389 --> 03:55:46.935]  And although I never espouse violence, and I say don't be the one who fires the first shot, nothing like that, we all do have the right to defend our communities, and to defend our lives, and defend our families, defend our nation, and especially defend our borders, and even defend our president.
[03:55:46.935 --> 03:55:54.698]  I have a feeling that the 2020 election is not going to be decisively, well, decided.
[03:55:54.698 --> 03:55:56.339]  I think it's going to be contested.
[03:55:57.156 --> 03:56:20.221]  And I think that the future belongs to those who are willing to defend their nation and defend their president and defend themselves against the zombie infestation of mindless, hate-filled leftists who are planning to try to do a communist type of takeover, a communist revolt in the spirit of Mao, of China.
[03:56:20.221 --> 03:56:22.322]  The communist revolution.
[03:56:22.322 --> 03:56:23.782]  This is what they're planning.
[03:56:23.782 --> 03:56:26.783]  And if you let them get away with it, they will gladly do it.
[03:56:27.330 --> 03:56:28.831]  They will take your country from you.
[03:56:28.831 --> 03:56:30.232]  They will take your life.
[03:56:30.232 --> 03:56:39.538]  The only thing that's stopping them right now, believe me, is the fact that there are, according to current estimates now, 500 million guns in the hands of Americans.
[03:56:39.538 --> 03:56:45.301]  Not the 300 million you've heard, but half a billion firearms in the hands of the American people.
[03:56:45.301 --> 03:56:47.983]  This is why they're pushing gun control so aggressively.
[03:56:47.983 --> 03:56:55.528]  They have to take away the guns first before they can succeed in their mission to sweep across America and install a communist regime in power.
[03:56:56.371 --> 03:57:01.693]  And when they try that, we need to be ready to defend our nation.
[03:57:01.693 --> 03:57:03.633]  We need to be ready, mentally ready.
[03:57:03.633 --> 03:57:04.853]  You need to have the skill set.
[03:57:04.853 --> 03:57:07.454]  You need to have the equipment.
[03:57:07.454 --> 03:57:10.235]  You need to have the personal resolve.
[03:57:10.235 --> 03:57:13.576]  You need to pray for guidance from God.
[03:57:13.576 --> 03:57:16.717]  Do not put your faith in any one person, not even the president.
[03:57:16.717 --> 03:57:23.459]  Put your faith in God and put your actions in the hands of your fellow neighbors and fellow patriots and fellow Americans.
[03:57:23.459 --> 03:57:23.859]  Be ready.
[03:57:24.665 --> 03:57:28.770]  You will be called upon, I believe, to defend your nation in the next few years.
[03:57:28.770 --> 03:57:31.113]  I think it's coming.
[03:57:31.113 --> 03:57:31.994]  Stay tuned.
[03:57:31.994 --> 03:57:32.655]  Stay informed.
[03:57:32.655 --> 03:57:34.477]  Read InfoWars.com.
[03:57:34.477 --> 03:57:35.338]  Want to read my website?
[03:57:35.338 --> 03:57:36.279]  It's NaturalNews.com.
[03:57:36.279 --> 03:57:38.762]  There's a lot coming.
[03:57:38.762 --> 03:57:40.805]  We'll stay online as long as we can.
[03:57:40.805 --> 03:57:41.425]  Thank you for listening.
[03:57:43.151 --> 03:57:48.576]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[03:57:48.576 --> 03:57:50.357]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[03:57:50.357 --> 03:57:52.119]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[03:57:52.119 --> 03:57:53.960]  Now, I can make them strong.
[03:57:53.960 --> 03:57:55.602]  Now, I can instruct them.
[03:57:55.602 --> 03:57:57.323]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[03:57:57.323 --> 03:57:58.324]  But not once I'm gone.
[03:57:58.424 --> 03:58:03.547]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[03:58:03.547 --> 03:58:09.150]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[03:58:09.150 --> 03:58:12.792]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[03:58:12.792 --> 03:58:17.775]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[03:58:17.775 --> 03:58:24.579]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[03:58:24.659 --> 03:58:28.421]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[03:58:28.421 --> 03:58:36.066]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[03:58:36.066 --> 03:58:44.851]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[03:58:44.851 --> 03:58:49.474]  Our grandparents, our great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
