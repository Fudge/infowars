[00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:18.597]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:21.299]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:24.782]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Tuesday, February 5th, 2019.
[00:00:24.782 --> 00:00:25.823]  Global Broadcast.
[00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:50.638]  Minutes before I went live, every day on NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com, we'll post a page for the show that day with the live video and audio feeds on the front page, so you don't have to go to InfoWars.com for its last show.
[00:00:50.638 --> 00:00:53.760]  And so people know what that particular broadcast is going to be about.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:03.549]  And I was sitting there, and I just couldn't come up with a headline, not for lack of news, but because the things happening are just too incredibly important.
[00:01:05.182 --> 00:01:07.923]  You know, the strangest things happen sometimes.
[00:01:07.923 --> 00:01:15.847]  I've known Mankell Muller for 20 years and he wanted me to do a Fox show with him.
[00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:16.927]  Fox offered us a show.
[00:01:16.927 --> 00:01:18.548]  He's done shows with Fox.
[00:01:18.548 --> 00:01:23.190]  It was a weekend show and I just, I couldn't fly to New York every weekend.
[00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.930]  But he's a Christian.
[00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:27.543]  And he's told me privately some stuff.
[00:01:27.543 --> 00:01:30.424]  You know, he's been in a lot of movies, knows a lot of Hollywood folks.
[00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:41.968]  So he knows a lot of what I'm saying is true because he's lived in LA, but also was number one in San Francisco.
[00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:52.032]  And so a lot of the things he's heard me talk about, he knew separately from people in San Francisco.
[00:01:54.082 --> 00:02:00.264]  And so I was on his show out of Chicago this morning, but then we taped a podcast after that he's been putting out.
[00:02:00.264 --> 00:02:08.946]  And I tried to come in here about two weeks ago in the new studio and tape a report on what we just went ahead and got into on air.
[00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:14.507]  But I think the way it got laid out on that show was extremely accurate and extremely powerful.
[00:02:14.507 --> 00:02:20.509]  And this is kind of a big deal that I'm going to be announcing on air.
[00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:21.469]  Well, it's beyond a big deal.
[00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.265]  I've already done it, and the globalists never pick it up, they never cover it.
[00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:30.868]  Because it's their secret religion.
[00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:37.174]  If you really want to know what Satanism is, Luciferianism is, you want to know what's really all going on, folks.
[00:02:37.174 --> 00:02:44.240]  This is the unified field theory on how all the secret societies operate, the whole shooting match.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.803]  And I've known this for a long time, and I've released pieces of it.
[00:02:50.953 --> 00:03:04.036]  But what I talked about for about 30 minutes with him today of the podcast, we talked over an hour, really crystallized all of it.
[00:03:04.036 --> 00:03:09.497]  And so as soon as this podcast comes out, I will air that here today, even tonight.
[00:03:09.497 --> 00:03:16.779]  I'm not sure when this podcast is gonna get released and we're gonna have State of the Union live coverage today, but this is it.
[00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.680]  And it was the strangest place for me to go ahead and just say it all.
[00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.716]  And I got it out pretty good, too, so... But this is the big enchilada.
[00:03:26.716 --> 00:03:28.617]  This is everything.
[00:03:28.617 --> 00:03:29.418]  Okay?
[00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:31.821]  If you know this, you know it all.
[00:03:31.821 --> 00:03:33.742]  And this is it.
[00:03:33.742 --> 00:03:36.825]  This is 100% going on, and it's incredible.
[00:03:36.825 --> 00:03:38.187]  And let me just say something.
[00:03:38.187 --> 00:03:40.229]  You're living in a science fiction thriller.
[00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.351]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:03:43.237 --> 00:03:43.998]  We're going to go to break.
[00:03:43.998 --> 00:03:49.102]  David Knight wasn't going to come back for two weeks, more, but he's back.
[00:03:49.102 --> 00:03:50.903]  And thank God he'll be in studio with me.
[00:03:50.903 --> 00:03:52.084]  David Knight after that heart attack.
[00:03:52.084 --> 00:03:53.666]  Thanks for all your prayers and support, folks.
[00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.247]  We got so much big show today.
[00:03:55.247 --> 00:03:57.589]  Whenever you share the links, that's how we get around the censors.
[00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:02.733]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:06.657]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:11.490]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.152]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[00:04:14.152 --> 00:04:18.455]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[00:04:18.455 --> 00:04:25.941]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[00:04:25.941 --> 00:04:28.363]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[00:04:31.798 --> 00:04:34.020]  We have seen what they want to do.
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.301]  They called it UN Agenda 21.
[00:04:35.301 --> 00:04:37.443]  Now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:40.306]  They want everybody off of the rural lands.
[00:04:40.306 --> 00:04:42.087]  They want people out of the suburbs.
[00:04:42.087 --> 00:04:50.174]  They want to pack everybody into the cities because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[00:04:50.174 --> 00:04:53.497]  Never missed your show any day.
[00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:55.079]  I mean, never.
[00:05:09.557 --> 00:05:18.561]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:28.646]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:37.170]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.350]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.511]  You must experience it.
[00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:42.591]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:47.512]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:05:47.512 --> 00:05:49.013]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:05:49.013 --> 00:05:50.493]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:05:50.493 --> 00:05:57.195]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:05:57.195 --> 00:05:58.675]  TurboForce at MForceLife.com.
[00:06:23.135 --> 00:06:25.778]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:30.905]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:41.423 --> 00:06:44.945]  Get through all that to explore what he's been saying.
[00:06:44.945 --> 00:06:49.987]  To see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you.
[00:06:49.987 --> 00:06:54.709]  And the information you find could be life-changing.
[00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:56.130]  He predicted 9-11.
[00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:03.033]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need.
[00:07:03.033 --> 00:07:04.734]  In this Orwellian phony system.
[00:07:04.734 --> 00:07:08.636]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:24.209]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[00:07:24.209 --> 00:07:32.696]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg Group et al.
[00:07:32.696 --> 00:07:40.783]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[00:07:40.783 --> 00:07:42.024]  They falsely edited him.
[00:07:44.537 --> 00:07:48.561]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:54.627]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[00:07:54.627 --> 00:08:00.673]  And now he is being de-platformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[00:08:00.673 --> 00:08:05.197]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[00:08:05.197 --> 00:08:07.580]  And then we get hit and say, you don't want to use our software.
[00:08:08.826 --> 00:08:12.169]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:13.790]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.851]  They just killed our stream.
[00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:16.312]  Really?
[00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:16.672]  Yep.
[00:08:16.672 --> 00:08:20.955]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[00:08:20.955 --> 00:08:22.096]  This is America in 2018.
[00:08:22.096 --> 00:08:30.502]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.203]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[00:08:37.203 --> 00:08:39.645]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[00:08:39.645 --> 00:08:47.610]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.554]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:18.388 --> 00:09:28.837]  I went to Infowars.com this morning at about 6.30 and at about 8 o'clock I saw it go live, the return of David Knight.
[00:09:28.837 --> 00:09:42.488]  So I'd just gotten my children off to school, got them in the car with the nanny, and went in and was feeding my 22-month-old baby on my lap and I had my laptop out and I went, David Knight!
[00:09:42.488 --> 00:09:45.650]  And I said, well I haven't seen him since his heart attack over a month ago.
[00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:46.871]  I don't know.
[00:10:03.957 --> 00:10:05.058]  That's how hard we're fighting here.
[00:10:05.058 --> 00:10:16.382]  I'm not complaining, just letting you know sometimes we'll stumble around a little bit because we're in the trenches, but it's good to see him here and it's good to see you so healthy looking because you were really getting white.
[00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:17.963]  You were losing a lot of weight.
[00:10:17.963 --> 00:10:22.025]  I remember we met like a week before he had the heart attack and I said, David, you need to take some time off, man.
[00:10:22.025 --> 00:10:22.345]  You're so...
[00:10:22.985 --> 00:10:24.386]  Well, you did have a heart attack!
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.481]  I was going to come back that Monday.
[00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:53.542]  I got pretty mad.
[00:10:53.542 --> 00:10:57.544]  I said, I've never thought about firing you, but do that again.
[00:10:57.544 --> 00:11:07.728]  Well, it was the medicine more than anything that I was really feeling the effects of, because they put you on a blood thinning medicine to make sure that you don't get a blockage there at the site of the stent.
[00:11:07.728 --> 00:11:11.150]  And some of the side effects of that make you short of breath and everything.
[00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:21.697]  In the time that I've had off, I've been working on trying to get some reschedule myself so that I'm taking a little bit of time for exercising.
[00:11:21.697 --> 00:11:25.079]  You look better than the David Knight I first met eight years ago.
[00:11:25.079 --> 00:11:25.619]  Well, thank you.
[00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:25.919]  Thank you.
[00:11:25.919 --> 00:11:30.322]  I did lose a lot of weight last year and that was intentional.
[00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:39.048]  I was on a keto diet and I thought I was feeling a lot better and I had just been saying to my wife, I said, you know, I've really been
[00:11:39.668 --> 00:11:46.459]  Blessed because my father had a lot of heart issues by the time he was my age.
[00:11:46.459 --> 00:11:52.888]  And he'd had open heart surgery several times for bypass, for valves, and he had other issues.
[00:11:52.888 --> 00:11:53.669]  My mother did too.
[00:11:53.669 --> 00:11:55.412]  And I'd never been bothered with any of that stuff.
[00:11:55.452 --> 00:11:59.814]  I mean, I'm going through talking to the doctors and said, you know, uh, uh, you know, what have you been in for?
[00:11:59.814 --> 00:12:05.618]  Well, nothing, you know, I didn't really have anything, uh, that, uh, that was, so it was really kind of, uh, off the radar.
[00:12:05.618 --> 00:12:12.221]  I, I, I knew I needed to, uh, schedule some exercise and, and things like that, but I, you know, just been putting it off.
[00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:13.362]  And then boom, you had the heart attack.
[00:12:13.362 --> 00:12:13.722]  Yeah.
[00:12:13.722 --> 00:12:14.122]  Yeah.
[00:12:14.122 --> 00:12:14.322]  Yeah.
[00:12:14.322 --> 00:12:15.963]  It came up all of a sudden.
[00:12:15.963 --> 00:12:19.685]  And, um, but, uh, well, people are really glad you're back.
[00:12:19.685 --> 00:12:20.145]  Well, thank you.
[00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:20.946]  It's great to be back.
[00:12:21.877 --> 00:12:22.979]  I don't micromanage you at all.
[00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:24.060]  Do I ever tell you what to do or say?
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:24.421]  No.
[00:12:24.421 --> 00:12:24.921]  No, not at all.
[00:12:24.921 --> 00:12:26.644]  Well, I'm going to start nannying a little bit.
[00:12:26.644 --> 00:12:29.768]  Plus, we've moved the warehouse.
[00:12:29.768 --> 00:12:30.269]  We have some more room.
[00:12:30.269 --> 00:12:31.090]  We're putting in offices.
[00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.475]  You can actually have an office, not be in that big bullpen, which can be stressful.
[00:12:34.475 --> 00:12:36.217]  That way you can actually focus.
[00:12:36.217 --> 00:12:37.339]  And expanding on that,
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:48.743]  You just really need to take care of yourself, because I know good and damn well that for a three-hour show, you prepare for three, four hours here and a couple hours at night.
[00:12:48.743 --> 00:13:02.468]  David, I mean, I hate to tell the listeners, but you just can't prepare double for what you do on air, because you get so focused on, like you're preparing for a State of the Union every day, you just, I'm not saying mail it in, but you've got to find a halfway mark there.
[00:13:02.608 --> 00:13:04.209]  Yeah, I agree, I agree.
[00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:06.749]  I've got to adjust things a little bit.
[00:13:06.749 --> 00:13:13.032]  And it is very important, you know, part of it is, you know, looking at the different risk factors.
[00:13:13.032 --> 00:13:22.695]  It's not just genetics, and it's not just, you know, what you eat, making sure that you've got proper nutrition, but it's also sleep, and that's a big part of, you know, having an early morning show.
[00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:23.095]  Oh, no doubt.
[00:13:23.095 --> 00:13:24.176]  You wanted the morning show.
[00:13:24.176 --> 00:13:24.996]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[00:13:24.996 --> 00:13:27.777]  And I'm like, man, that's that, the way you prepare, I'm like, dude,
[00:13:29.085 --> 00:13:34.828]  I mean, I know, I'm not exaggerating, you prepare like four or five hours, you can't get up at two in the morning and prepare and then come in here and do this.
[00:13:34.828 --> 00:13:38.290]  Yeah, well I do a pretty large survey of the news to find out.
[00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:43.072]  Well, I mean, believe me, you're one of the few people, and I'm a newshound, that always knows more than I do.
[00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:50.016]  But it's kind of, you're an engineer and a lot of other stuff, but people want you to be healthy and happy and play a few video clips, do some red meat political stuff.
[00:13:50.016 --> 00:13:50.296]  Yeah.
[00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:51.457]  I mean, look, you've got...
[00:13:51.937 --> 00:13:55.480]  Because we've got the demographics that come in, we can see it on all the analytics.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:03.286]  You've got the high-end engineer type, astronaut type, rich people, smart people are listening to you.
[00:14:03.286 --> 00:14:05.248]  Because they know, wow, this guy actually did research.
[00:14:06.109 --> 00:14:07.109]  And that's great, David.
[00:14:07.109 --> 00:14:10.390]  You just don't have to, like, do six, seven hours of preparation every day.
[00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.691]  I don't think it's healthy.
[00:14:11.691 --> 00:14:12.131]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:15.992]  I've got to get... Look, David, like, is a laser beam in a zone.
[00:14:15.992 --> 00:14:20.494]  You go in there and he's focused with his headphones on, and he's just, like, brainiac, hardly even taking breaks.
[00:14:20.494 --> 00:14:21.634]  I'm like, hey, dude.
[00:14:21.634 --> 00:14:26.756]  And, of course, I'm a workaholic, too, so if I'm telling David Knight... I mean, this is, like, the extreme version right here.
[00:14:27.196 --> 00:14:30.897]  Yeah, you've got to get a little better perspective.
[00:14:30.897 --> 00:14:39.019]  When they arrested Roger, I drove into town, I got on the phone, because it just bothered me so much to see that happening.
[00:14:39.019 --> 00:14:47.482]  We just had the CEO of Google, under oath, say, we're not shutting down or pushing this agenda or that agenda.
[00:14:48.482 --> 00:14:49.502]  Absolutely lying about that.
[00:14:49.502 --> 00:14:50.522]  That came out a couple of weeks ago.
[00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:51.142]  On its face!
[00:14:51.142 --> 00:14:52.183]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.843]  But, you know, we're not going to do anything about that.
[00:14:53.843 --> 00:15:01.384]  There was no... They're trying to make a big deal out of the fact that Roger is conspiring to try to set up an interview with somebody.
[00:15:01.384 --> 00:15:02.985]  Well, that's what we do here, right?
[00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:08.105]  Oh, they've got breathless articles at Media Matters going, should Jones be arrested?
[00:15:08.105 --> 00:15:13.026]  He told Stone, okay, I'll give you a job if you get Assange on and get Trump on and get me all these big guests.
[00:15:13.026 --> 00:15:13.766]  That's what you do.
[00:15:13.766 --> 00:15:14.607]  You want a job?
[00:15:14.607 --> 00:15:16.087]  Go get me all the biggest interviews.
[00:15:16.087 --> 00:15:16.267]  Yeah.
[00:15:16.787 --> 00:15:18.989]  How is that bad?
[00:15:18.989 --> 00:15:20.891]  Assange went on all those shows!
[00:15:20.891 --> 00:15:21.751]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:15:21.751 --> 00:15:22.132]  Exactly.
[00:15:22.132 --> 00:15:25.255]  They're not going after the journalists who interviewed him.
[00:15:25.255 --> 00:15:25.595]  You know what?
[00:15:25.595 --> 00:15:28.758]  If Mueller wants to indict me for trying to interview Assange, just do it, you crook.
[00:15:28.758 --> 00:15:29.919]  I'm not afraid of you.
[00:15:29.919 --> 00:15:32.141]  You're an un-American bastard.
[00:15:32.141 --> 00:15:34.463]  Shameful piece of crap, and I'm not afraid of you.
[00:15:34.463 --> 00:15:36.785]  Or any of you other punks, by the way.
[00:15:36.785 --> 00:15:38.766]  I'm loaded for bear on Rogan, by the way.
[00:15:38.766 --> 00:15:39.827]  Rogan, fill your hand.
[00:15:39.827 --> 00:15:40.968]  Get ready, buddy.
[00:15:40.968 --> 00:15:41.309]  Hold on.
[00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.889]  Stay right there.
[00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:42.430]  Let's come back.
[00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:47.234]  Uh, and one more segment about just the general world, everything you see and what you see.
[00:15:47.234 --> 00:15:52.217]  Oh my God, I'm so proud of Trump trying to pull out the military and McConnell sent him a letter threatening impeachment.
[00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:54.099]  And we don't stand an 18 year long war.
[00:15:54.099 --> 00:15:55.079]  My Lord.
[00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:55.560]  We'll be back.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:55.960]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.538 --> 00:16:00.799]  Maybe not today.
[00:16:00.799 --> 00:16:02.080]  Maybe not tomorrow.

[00:17:28.453 --> 00:17:34.796]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:34.796 --> 00:17:37.838]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:37.838 --> 00:17:43.761]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:47.543]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.543 --> 00:17:48.823]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:48.823 --> 00:17:50.164]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.164 --> 00:17:56.367]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:57.788]  Available at Amazon Books.

[00:20:03.277 --> 00:20:11.844]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:12.985]  Big Brother.
[00:20:12.985 --> 00:20:14.787]  Mainstream media.
[00:20:14.787 --> 00:20:16.688]  Government cover-ups.
[00:20:16.688 --> 00:20:18.370]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.051]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:20.051 --> 00:20:24.555]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.768]  Lookin' for adventure In whatever comes our way
[00:20:39.395 --> 00:20:46.978]  We're promoting a pro-human, pro-family, pro-God, future based on love and decency and free will.
[00:20:46.978 --> 00:20:53.881]  The Global is proposing one based on pharmakia, brainwashing, genetic engineering, just total evil.
[00:20:53.881 --> 00:21:02.905]  I have articles where China just ordered the entire population in the next two years to stop serving fat pigs.
[00:21:04.309 --> 00:21:12.155]  But then you read, and the minute I saw it, I went, that's the genetically engineered South Korean pig that's like, you know, has almost no fat, and it looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime.
[00:21:12.155 --> 00:21:12.515]  Boom!
[00:21:12.515 --> 00:21:30.908]  Bottom of the article, oh, it's a genetically engineered South Korean pig that the government has now bought the patent to, and that they now built up all the piglet population for, because pigs can have like four or five litters a year, and that within two years, China is ordered to produce this pig because it's healthier.
[00:21:30.908 --> 00:21:33.050]  And see how they slipped in genetically engineered pigs?
[00:21:34.414 --> 00:21:36.855]  Without even pointing out it's a nickel-engineered pitch.
[00:21:36.855 --> 00:21:37.915]  It's just crazy.
[00:21:37.915 --> 00:21:45.156]  David Knight's here, and a lot of people... David asked me, why are you still supporting Trump when he said, okay, have an amnesty?
[00:21:45.156 --> 00:21:46.937]  Because he knew they'd say, no, not even that.
[00:21:46.937 --> 00:21:48.657]  I mean, I know what he's doing.
[00:21:48.657 --> 00:21:50.598]  And he hasn't gone after the vaccines yet.
[00:21:50.598 --> 00:21:57.579]  He's done some things I don't like, but trying to pull us out of wars, trying to reform the criminal justice system so blacks don't get tripled the time whites do.
[00:21:57.579 --> 00:22:00.000]  That's something really racist we need to deal with because he's...
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:10.525]  Prisons are like colleges of crime, and marching in pro-life rallies, and getting us out of TPP, and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, obviously to try to hurt the recovery.
[00:22:10.525 --> 00:22:26.733]  Clearly he's trying to be an American president, so I support him more that he's so in battle, but now, as Rand Paul has said, we're going to play the clip in a moment, long 15 minute speech, but just this two minutes is powerful, how dare all of you say he's bad and a traitor, and now the Democrats in national polls, 54% in Gallup polls,
[00:22:28.414 --> 00:22:38.363]  Want more war, and think that the defense budget should be even bigger, and that Trump's... So now they're the party of war, the party of locking black people up, and I guess they always were.
[00:22:38.363 --> 00:22:40.445]  Hillary calling them super predators.
[00:22:40.445 --> 00:22:43.528]  It's so upside down world, David.
[00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:50.935]  And quite frankly, I've never been prouder of Trump with the situation, trying to pull our troops out of these no-win fake situations.
[00:22:52.256 --> 00:22:55.077]  We're talking $50 billion a year right now in Afghanistan.
[00:22:55.077 --> 00:22:56.858]  It's usually $100 plus billion.
[00:22:56.858 --> 00:22:59.180]  I mean, the wall doesn't cost that.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:00.361]  This is crazy!
[00:23:00.361 --> 00:23:01.241]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:23:01.241 --> 00:23:06.364]  And we have to, I think, help President Trump.
[00:23:06.364 --> 00:23:10.427]  70% of the Republican voters, according to the latest poll, said they want something done about the border.
[00:23:11.107 --> 00:23:18.833]  And I think that we have to understand that he's getting a lot of pushback from even people in the Republican Party, like Mitch McConnell, pushing back against him.
[00:23:18.833 --> 00:23:23.737]  I mean, he had pushback against him from Paul Ryan, who has always been for open borders.
[00:23:23.737 --> 00:23:25.879]  I mean, Paul Ryan was there with Mitt Romney.
[00:23:25.879 --> 00:23:30.142]  They knew that they were going to get Romneycare or Obamacare, whatever.
[00:23:30.142 --> 00:23:31.243]  There's no difference between the two.
[00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:32.624]  They knew they were going to get that.
[00:23:32.624 --> 00:23:36.247]  They were their hedge position in case something went wrong with Obama.
[00:23:36.247 --> 00:23:51.740]  But I think, Alex, it would be perfect for President Trump to actually read, as I, in the last segment of the show today, I had some quotes from President Obama that he read at one of his State of the Unions talking about the border and the kind of stuff that he would... Their rhetoric is stronger than Trump's.
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.361]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:55.263]  And yet, you know, Trump is supposed to be a racist.
[00:23:55.263 --> 00:24:04.610]  No, what we've seen in the last couple of weeks with this governor out of Virginia is we have seen the overt racism of the Democrat Party, which has always been there.
[00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:09.234]  Look at Robert Byrd, look at the origins of the Southern Poverty Law Center, what Morris Deese was doing.
[00:24:09.234 --> 00:24:11.476]  It's only involved— Because the South was great in many ways.
[00:24:12.196 --> 00:24:18.997]  We're Southerners, but it was also about playing poor white farmers off against poor blacks, and that's been the management system.
[00:24:18.997 --> 00:24:21.538]  So the Democrats, they play people off against each other.
[00:24:21.538 --> 00:24:23.718]  It's what they do for 200 years.
[00:24:23.718 --> 00:24:24.419]  That's who they are.
[00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:29.300]  They've been the demographic party, and they've always played one demographic against the other.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.700]  They've always been a racist party.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.560]  They still are.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.821]  All that they see is racist, racist, racist.
[00:24:34.821 --> 00:24:35.681]  You hear that from them every day.
[00:24:35.681 --> 00:24:36.481]  God, am I sick of it.
[00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:40.104]  Which race that they're going to demonize is the only thing that changes.
[00:24:40.104 --> 00:24:50.133]  And I always liked Martin Luther King, but man, I go back and watch his speeches now about unity and what we stand for, and it's like, and the Democrats haven't just rejected it, they have run it over.
[00:24:50.133 --> 00:24:53.776]  And it was Republicans, Martin Luther King was a Republican.
[00:24:53.776 --> 00:25:00.582]  It was Martin Luther King and the Republicans forced the Democrats to stop being demons, so they flipped and now turned the minorities into a bunch of racists.
[00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:02.984]  I mean, this is the craziest crap I've ever heard.
[00:25:02.984 --> 00:25:03.784]  But here's the good news.
[00:25:04.605 --> 00:25:06.487]  Trump on the war front.
[00:25:06.487 --> 00:25:08.668]  There's no point to have our military there.
[00:25:08.668 --> 00:25:11.350]  We put in over a trillion dollars in Afghanistan.
[00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.771]  It's almost two trillion now.
[00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:14.653]  And then China gets all the rare earth minerals.
[00:25:14.653 --> 00:25:15.774]  We get none.
[00:25:15.774 --> 00:25:17.775]  Let them go die for the damn minerals.
[00:25:17.775 --> 00:25:24.040]  We are literally doing nothing but propping up all these regimes for China, for U.S.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.701]  companies allied with China.
[00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:27.043]  Pull out of Afghanistan.
[00:25:27.043 --> 00:25:27.803]  It's the right move.
[00:25:27.803 --> 00:25:29.404]  Get completely out.
[00:25:29.404 --> 00:25:29.965]  Here's Rand Paul.
[00:25:31.929 --> 00:25:33.670]  Is Afghanistan a mess?
[00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.091]  Sure it's a mess.
[00:25:35.091 --> 00:25:39.255]  It's always been a mess and always will be a mess.
[00:25:39.255 --> 00:25:43.758]  But now our mission has changed to nation building.
[00:25:43.758 --> 00:25:49.682]  I want to compliment President Trump for being bold and brave in saying enough's enough.
[00:25:49.682 --> 00:25:51.784]  Let's spend that money at home.
[00:25:51.784 --> 00:25:56.467]  We spend 51 billion dollars a year in Afghanistan.
[00:25:56.467 --> 00:25:57.848]  That money could be spent at home.
[00:25:58.629 --> 00:26:01.291]  I've got three members of my family in the military.
[00:26:01.291 --> 00:26:04.253]  I don't want them to go to Afghanistan.
[00:26:04.253 --> 00:26:15.760]  Every one of our political and military leaders, Republican, Democrat and Independent, will tell you there is no military mission in Afghanistan and yet we stay.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:22.045]  Some of the very same people who say we have no mission in the next breath say we need to send more troops there.
[00:26:22.785 --> 00:26:28.774]  We sent 100,000 and we completely had victory, and then they came back as our troops came down.
[00:26:28.774 --> 00:26:31.277]  Are we to send 100,000 and keep them there forever?
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.104]  This resolution is an insult to the President and I will oppose it.
[00:26:37.104 --> 00:26:45.351]  This resolution is put forward by Republicans who say to President Trump that you are leaving precipitously from Afghanistan.
[00:26:45.351 --> 00:26:50.235]  How do you leave precipitously after 17 years?
[00:26:50.235 --> 00:26:51.316]  17 years!
[00:26:51.316 --> 00:26:55.300]  We are no longer fighting anyone who attacked us on 9-11.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.243]  The people we are fighting were not even born when 9-11 happened.
[00:26:59.864 --> 00:27:03.647]  The war over there has nothing to do with 9-11.
[00:27:03.647 --> 00:27:05.508]  It has to do with nation building.
[00:27:05.508 --> 00:27:06.069]  And profit making.
[00:27:06.069 --> 00:27:09.351]  And I'll tell you what one Navy SEAL told me that I met a year or two ago.
[00:27:09.351 --> 00:27:19.879]  He says, we'll go anywhere, we'll kill our enemy, we'll do what you ask of us, but the mistake is when you ask us to stay, plant the flag, and become policemen.
[00:27:19.879 --> 00:27:21.401]  They don't want to be policemen.
[00:27:21.401 --> 00:27:24.883]  Our military do not want to be the policemen of the world.
[00:27:24.883 --> 00:27:27.525]  We fight when we have to and we should come home.
[00:27:27.525 --> 00:27:29.327]  That money should be spent here at home.
[00:27:30.512 --> 00:27:44.380]  What I'm saying with this resolution is, I'm for replacing it completely and saying to President Trump, we think you're doing a great job, and thank goodness for being bold enough to say it's time to start thinking about America first.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:59.048]  So I would like to ask unanimous consent that we get rid of the resolution condemning the President, and that we replace it with a resolution that says simply this, that we applaud President Trump for being bold and brave enough
[00:27:59.898 --> 00:28:05.284]  To consider bringing our troops home, declaring victory, and ending America's longest war.
[00:28:19.318 --> 00:28:21.360]  And they threatened to impeach the President.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.262]  And this is the Republicans and Democrats together.
[00:28:24.262 --> 00:28:27.604]  This is a shameful moment, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:27.604 --> 00:28:30.326]  You want Blacks not getting three times the Senate's as whites?
[00:28:30.326 --> 00:28:31.547]  Trump did it.
[00:28:31.547 --> 00:28:32.948]  You want the in-laws?
[00:28:32.948 --> 00:28:33.549]  Trump's doing it.
[00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:35.130]  And then the Democrats hating more.
[00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.031]  These people are shameful, Devin.
[00:28:36.727 --> 00:28:41.752]  It's absolutely amazing, and you know, Afghanistan has a history of being where empires go to die.
[00:28:41.752 --> 00:28:44.115]  You know, we saw that with Soviet Union.
[00:28:44.115 --> 00:28:46.157]  Or Alexander the Great 2,000 plus years ago.
[00:28:46.157 --> 00:28:49.341]  Yeah, look at what they did to the British Empire at its peak.
[00:28:49.341 --> 00:28:51.463]  Afghanistan is a joke!
[00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:53.365]  It's a bunch of crazy cavemen.
[00:28:53.365 --> 00:28:54.206]  We don't need to be there.
[00:28:54.206 --> 00:28:55.507]  Let the Chaikoms go die there.
[00:28:55.507 --> 00:28:56.028]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.751]  I weighed 329 pounds.
[00:29:00.751 --> 00:29:02.231]  I was a heart attack waiting to happen.
[00:29:02.231 --> 00:29:03.491]  I got Andro 400.
[00:29:03.491 --> 00:29:04.832]  It makes me not so hungry.
[00:29:04.832 --> 00:29:06.472]  I started noticing more energy.
[00:29:06.472 --> 00:29:08.913]  I noticed my belly was starting to shrink up.
[00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:10.174]  I started seeing weight come off.
[00:29:10.174 --> 00:29:11.354]  80-some pounds.
[00:29:11.354 --> 00:29:13.415]  I went from 330 to 245.
[00:29:13.415 --> 00:29:17.016]  For a 56-year-old guy to lose that much weight, it took something, brother.
[00:29:17.016 --> 00:29:17.816]  I feel great.
[00:29:17.816 --> 00:29:20.177]  I feel like I was when I was 35 years old.
[00:29:20.177 --> 00:29:21.177]  That was Ruben.
[00:29:21.177 --> 00:29:23.398]  Now listen to what Josh says about Andro 400.
[00:29:24.198 --> 00:29:26.100]  Well, I'll tell you, man, that stuff really works.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.060]  It was insane!
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.682]  I've heard the commercials, what, for a decade?
[00:29:28.682 --> 00:29:30.223]  I was like, you know, I'm just gonna try it.
[00:29:30.223 --> 00:29:31.784]  My pants are, like, falling off.
[00:29:31.784 --> 00:29:32.565]  It really works.
[00:29:32.565 --> 00:29:36.228]  I bought suits last year for my new job, and they're falling off of me.
[00:29:36.228 --> 00:29:36.968]  It's insane!
[00:29:36.968 --> 00:29:43.454]  Guys, if you want to lose belly fat, gain energy, strength, and muscle, and look and feel years younger, try Andro 400.

[00:30:09.622 --> 00:30:18.626]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:30:18.626 --> 00:30:28.691]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[00:30:39.416 --> 00:30:40.576]  You must experience it.
[00:30:40.576 --> 00:30:42.657]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:30:42.657 --> 00:30:47.579]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:49.080]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.560]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:57.263]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:14.085]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[00:32:14.085 --> 00:32:25.109]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[00:32:26.425 --> 00:32:28.352]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[00:32:28.352 --> 00:32:31.022]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[00:32:32.381 --> 00:32:36.723]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[00:32:36.723 --> 00:32:40.984]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[00:32:40.984 --> 00:32:43.265]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[00:32:43.265 --> 00:32:45.586]  This country is in a war!
[00:32:45.586 --> 00:32:56.270]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.871]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[00:33:02.771 --> 00:33:19.895]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.895 --> 00:33:24.816]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:24.816 --> 00:33:26.236]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.373 --> 00:33:38.199]  Five years ago, the Australian government put a internet control switch in place so that all internet coming into the country and out could be censored.
[00:33:38.199 --> 00:33:40.800]  In fact, they said, we're going to adopt Chinese-style censorship.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.222]  Then they backed off because of lawsuits and governmental changes.
[00:33:43.222 --> 00:33:54.330]  But I've been flooded with emails, calls, just all over InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, that the video and audio streams, both from InfoWars, are being cut off and blocked in Australia.
[00:33:55.285 --> 00:34:01.433]  We've got IT looking at that, but we are running into next level attempts to not get the broadcast out.
[00:34:01.433 --> 00:34:04.217]  So, everything's free to air.
[00:34:04.217 --> 00:34:06.660]  We send the TV show out on satellite over the internet.
[00:34:08.163 --> 00:34:13.586]  Anyone wants to pick it up, anyone wants to carry it, anybody wants to chop it up, you want to re-stream it on your website?
[00:34:13.586 --> 00:34:23.692]  That's how we're going to get around all this, is for other people to set up InfoWars backup stations where you get our streams and then you re-send them out on different formats, different ways, and the enemy can't stop it.
[00:34:23.692 --> 00:34:27.955]  But we're the beta test by the globalists of how to shut down the entire internet.
[00:34:27.955 --> 00:34:32.337]  Separately, we have had all our sponsors.
[00:34:32.337 --> 00:34:34.599]  You hear sponsors from the radio stations, that's their sponsor.
[00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:36.520]  Or you hear the GCN Network, they have their sponsors.
[00:34:37.452 --> 00:34:44.895]  But almost all of our funding comes from you buying t-shirts, buying books, buying videos, buying supplements.
[00:34:44.895 --> 00:34:52.398]  And most of the funding supplements, and coffee was like a best seller, because it's something you order, toothpaste is keeping us afloat.
[00:34:52.398 --> 00:34:55.620]  Even though we make like four bucks a tube on average, okay?
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.801]  And yeah, we sell tens of thousands of tubes per quarter, it doesn't pay the bills.
[00:34:58.801 --> 00:34:59.642]  It doesn't do it.
[00:34:59.642 --> 00:35:03.263]  Our bandwidth, ladies and gentlemen, we're all paying for our own bandwidth now.
[00:35:03.263 --> 00:35:04.704]  We've been taking off YouTube everywhere else.
[00:35:05.544 --> 00:35:14.353]  And so, yeah, we have record audience coming to us and millions of dollars in bandwidth cost, the infrastructure, all of it.
[00:35:14.353 --> 00:35:17.577]  I'm fighting as hard as I can, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:17.577 --> 00:35:20.200]  So I want to thank you for the support, but I want you just to remember that
[00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:28.464]  The fight's escalated here, and if you go to m4warsstore.com or m4warslife.com and get the Wake Up America coffee.
[00:35:28.464 --> 00:35:34.468]  It's the highest quality organic coffee from southern Mexico, right there by the Guatemalan border.
[00:35:34.468 --> 00:35:35.549]  High mountain organic.
[00:35:35.549 --> 00:35:37.410]  It's super awesome.
[00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:41.513]  And, you know, the same brand, under another name, sells at Whole Foods for twice the price.
[00:35:42.133 --> 00:35:43.674]  People are like, wow, this is really good coffee.
[00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:45.175]  Yeah.
[00:35:45.175 --> 00:35:46.215]  Everything we do is to get you the best.
[00:35:46.215 --> 00:35:52.698]  We have BrainForce Plus, the amazing Nootropic, 50% off with 33% off TurboForce.
[00:35:52.698 --> 00:35:59.242]  That's a total body pre-workout, total energy, all the different types of healthy energy that release slowly.
[00:35:59.242 --> 00:36:04.284]  So that instead of, you know, two hours you crash or four hours, 10 hours and then without the crash.
[00:36:04.284 --> 00:36:05.305]  But let me warn you.
[00:36:06.065 --> 00:36:10.166]  Nobody's put something together like this with all the other amino acids and things that help it upload.
[00:36:10.166 --> 00:36:13.007]  So get that combo at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:36:13.007 --> 00:36:18.209]  Brain Synergy combo at InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:18.209 --> 00:36:19.509]  We have 40% off Super Silver Wound Gel.
[00:36:19.509 --> 00:36:20.170]  Super Silver Wound Gel
[00:36:25.792 --> 00:36:29.654]  is the only FDA-approved gel of its type.
[00:36:29.654 --> 00:36:32.896]  It's the strongest you can get sold in stores.
[00:36:32.896 --> 00:36:39.340]  We pioneered silver, how good it was as a backup 20 years ago, and we were the cooks.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.921]  Now it's in the hospitals everywhere.
[00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:43.923]  This is the private-labeled, made-in-America type.
[00:36:43.923 --> 00:36:45.744]  They also make the prescription for the hospitals.
[00:36:45.744 --> 00:36:46.965]  This is the strongest non-prescription.
[00:36:46.965 --> 00:36:50.046]  We private-label it and sell it for, on average, $10 less than they do.
[00:36:50.046 --> 00:36:50.687]  That's $40 in stores.
[00:36:53.442 --> 00:36:55.604]  We normally sell it for $29.95.
[00:36:55.604 --> 00:36:57.406]  It's $22 right now.
[00:36:57.406 --> 00:36:58.767]  Super silver.
[00:36:58.767 --> 00:37:00.929]  There's nothing like it.
[00:37:00.929 --> 00:37:02.451]  It's unbelievable.
[00:37:02.451 --> 00:37:02.931]  57 reviews.
[00:37:02.931 --> 00:37:04.292]  100% satisfaction.
[00:37:04.292 --> 00:37:06.655]  100% satisfaction.
[00:37:06.655 --> 00:37:07.235]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:37:07.235 --> 00:37:09.437]  David, you were making some really good points during the break.
[00:37:16.252 --> 00:37:16.633]  about it.
[00:37:35.316 --> 00:37:48.547]  Yeah, if you look at professional sports, and you look at the stadiums that we provide for these billionaires, and of course, it's actually been a profit center for a dozen of the football teams to have these stadiums put in place.
[00:37:48.547 --> 00:37:51.270]  And the question is, why are we going into bondage for this?
[00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.251]  Because that's what's happening.
[00:37:52.251 --> 00:37:56.654]  We're having these bond issues being put in, and it is subsidizing of these people.
[00:37:56.654 --> 00:38:00.638]  You don't hear anything about that when we talk about what's going on with the border.
[00:38:00.638 --> 00:38:01.699]  But like, Trump should say that!
[00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:02.599]  Yeah.
[00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:08.081]  Trump should say, hey, we can pay two, three billion dollars per stadium on local taxpayers.
[00:38:08.081 --> 00:38:09.722]  We're not going into bondage for this.
[00:38:09.722 --> 00:38:11.763]  We have Latin America collapsing.
[00:38:11.763 --> 00:38:13.324]  We must build the wall.
[00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:15.825]  It's a symbol of national sovereignty.
[00:38:15.825 --> 00:38:16.145]  Yeah.
[00:38:16.145 --> 00:38:17.585]  Well, look at everything that they've done.
[00:38:17.585 --> 00:38:21.267]  Look at the amount of money that we give to the U.N., twice as much as what he's asking for.
[00:38:21.707 --> 00:38:23.889]  Look at what we did in Syria.
[00:38:23.889 --> 00:38:28.932]  We never had a vote or discussion about whether we're going to put American troops there, but they built more than a dozen bases.
[00:38:28.932 --> 00:38:30.733]  They built four airfields there.
[00:38:30.733 --> 00:38:32.014]  They did it very quickly.
[00:38:32.014 --> 00:38:33.756]  They did it without any debate.
[00:38:33.756 --> 00:38:36.918]  The American people didn't even know that was there.
[00:38:36.918 --> 00:38:38.859]  And yet, you know, we're told that we can't do anything.
[00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:42.642]  And let's be clear, if we were building empires, let's go to the end of the segment.
[00:38:42.642 --> 00:38:43.943]  I was going to play a clip that will come up after the break.
[00:38:45.327 --> 00:38:55.173]  If we were going to be evil, like the British Empire, that actually brought a lot of good things to the countries they controlled, or the Roman Empire, where we actually get stuff back to the home country, the homeland.
[00:38:55.173 --> 00:38:58.435]  We pay to protect China's interest for U.S.
[00:38:58.435 --> 00:39:00.596]  trader companies in Afghanistan.
[00:39:00.596 --> 00:39:02.918]  They bring out all the rarest minerals, we get zero.
[00:39:02.918 --> 00:39:03.959]  You look it up.
[00:39:03.959 --> 00:39:07.481]  So we're paying 50 to 100 to 150 billion a year, depending on the year.
[00:39:08.786 --> 00:39:11.929]  To be in Afghanistan... We're unpaid mercenaries.
[00:39:11.929 --> 00:39:13.811]  Unpaid mercenaries.
[00:39:13.811 --> 00:39:15.232]  America is China's mercenaries.
[00:39:15.232 --> 00:39:15.792]  That's right.
[00:39:15.792 --> 00:39:20.296]  And when you look at what is happening... We built the Panama Canal and just gave it to them.
[00:39:20.296 --> 00:39:21.377]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:21.377 --> 00:39:22.298]  Look at what is happening.
[00:39:22.298 --> 00:39:29.525]  I mean, look at the... Every time we turn around, it's the Chinese who are threatening in aggressive ways.
[00:39:29.525 --> 00:39:30.966]  Threatening Taiwan, for example.
[00:39:31.506 --> 00:39:38.898]  Threatening any American ships that are going through international waters because they do that deliberately to keep those waters open to international traffic.
[00:39:38.898 --> 00:39:45.608]  But they are very aggressively moving towards that and yet we never see any criticism of China in the media whatsoever.
[00:39:45.608 --> 00:39:46.589]  They always get a free pass.
[00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:58.502]  It's amazing how they can eviscerate our industry, how they can get subsidized, how they can set up these control structures, because they are the beta test site for what the globalists want to do to this country.
[00:39:58.502 --> 00:40:02.846]  That's right, the globalists made the deal to parlay China's hard-working, smart population, but controlled.
[00:40:03.627 --> 00:40:07.669]  They didn't have robots to replace humans yet, so they got Chinese.
[00:40:07.669 --> 00:40:11.511]  Now, Macron on the left, oh, humans are obsolete, robots will replace you.
[00:40:11.511 --> 00:40:12.632]  They want people that'll take orders.
[00:40:12.632 --> 00:40:22.057]  Well, they've got China, authoritarian for 6,000 years, and they'll have any genetic engineering, any corruption, killing of Christians, Buddhists, anything goes.
[00:40:22.057 --> 00:40:24.959]  You know, the average American thinks, oh, China's Chinese people.
[00:40:24.959 --> 00:40:25.579]  No.
[00:40:25.579 --> 00:40:29.101]  I go in Chinese food restaurants all over the country, suddenly all my food's being bought by the owners.
[00:40:29.101 --> 00:40:30.101]  They just love me.
[00:40:30.101 --> 00:40:32.883]  There's Falun Gong newspapers, Epoch Times everywhere.
[00:40:34.644 --> 00:40:39.366]  Almost everybody I meet in America who's Chinese absolutely loves Trump.
[00:40:39.366 --> 00:40:41.847]  And by the way, Trump's popular in China.
[00:40:41.847 --> 00:40:43.608]  People are sick of this crap.
[00:40:43.608 --> 00:40:44.008]  Oh yeah.
[00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:44.788]  They're sick of it.
[00:40:44.788 --> 00:40:47.530]  The Communist Party of China is not the Chinese people.
[00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:48.150]  It's not your daughter!
[00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.331]  That's right.
[00:40:49.331 --> 00:40:51.753]  Yeah, we adopted my daughter from China.
[00:40:51.753 --> 00:41:01.820]  But you know, Alex, when we look at this, it's the total... They can go to China because there's absolutely no ethical restraints by the communist leadership there.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.982]  They'll do anything to anybody for their purposes.
[00:41:03.982 --> 00:41:05.663]  And that's what we're starting to see in this country.
[00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:17.173]  That's one of the things out of this back and forth with this Virginia governor and the fact that he can openly talk about a newborn baby, setting it on the table, making a decision whether they're going to destroy that baby or not.
[00:41:17.953 --> 00:41:20.835]  And there's no reaction from the Democrat base.
[00:41:20.835 --> 00:41:23.356]  He's only lost 20 points from his Democrat base.
[00:41:23.356 --> 00:41:26.758]  Oh, they definitely already had that blackface thing and then leaked that out, though.
[00:41:26.758 --> 00:41:27.598]  To move it along, yeah.
[00:41:27.598 --> 00:41:37.123]  Because, I mean, him saying, we keep the baby comfortable and it's good, and that stupid fake Southern accent that he plays on, it's a woman's choice to stay out of it.
[00:41:37.403 --> 00:41:39.164]  Well, look at how they're expanding this.
[00:41:39.164 --> 00:41:40.704]  I mean, it started with Cuomo in New York.
[00:41:40.704 --> 00:41:42.685]  We've got the governor in Rhode Island.
[00:41:42.685 --> 00:41:43.925]  They're pushing the same type of thing.
[00:41:43.925 --> 00:41:44.425]  Late term abortion.
[00:41:44.425 --> 00:41:44.685]  Exactly.
[00:41:44.685 --> 00:41:47.506]  We're trying to, like, you say, just don't kill eight-month-old babies.
[00:41:47.506 --> 00:41:48.726]  They're like, screw you!
[00:41:48.726 --> 00:41:51.527]  We'll kill them after they're born, which has always been the next wave.
[00:41:51.527 --> 00:41:51.827]  Yeah.
[00:41:51.827 --> 00:41:53.948]  It's what Peter Singer, it's what PETA wants.
[00:41:53.948 --> 00:41:54.688]  It's what they're doing.
[00:41:54.688 --> 00:41:55.548]  It's totally sick.
[00:41:55.548 --> 00:42:00.950]  David Knight, I, you know, you look ten years younger, and I'm sorry, a heart attack's what it took to get you in there.
[00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:04.311]  It's making me think about exercising more and not working 18 hours a day.
[00:42:04.311 --> 00:42:06.912]  But it's good to have you back on the team, and just God bless you.
[00:42:07.312 --> 00:42:08.092]  I appreciate you.
[00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:08.852]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:42:08.852 --> 00:42:09.433]  It's great to be back.
[00:42:09.433 --> 00:42:10.073]  I appreciate it.
[00:42:10.073 --> 00:42:11.893]  And it's not a sprint, it's a marathon.
[00:42:11.893 --> 00:42:13.094]  I'm telling myself that.
[00:42:13.094 --> 00:42:13.554]  That's right.
[00:42:13.554 --> 00:42:16.195]  You are condemned to only prepare three hours a day.
[00:42:16.195 --> 00:42:16.715]  Okay.
[00:42:16.715 --> 00:42:17.515]  Commit to that.
[00:42:17.515 --> 00:42:17.835]  All right.
[00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:18.775]  We'll do that.
[00:42:18.775 --> 00:42:19.535]  All right.
[00:42:19.535 --> 00:42:20.696]  Great to have David Knight.
[00:42:20.696 --> 00:42:21.856]  He's on 8 a.m.
[00:42:21.856 --> 00:42:22.296]  every morning.
[00:42:22.296 --> 00:42:24.477]  Harrison Smith did a great job filling in for him.
[00:42:24.477 --> 00:42:28.418]  Harrison is going to be captaining with some other crew, a new show we're going to launch soon.
[00:42:28.418 --> 00:42:35.240]  I want to do it by the end of last year, but we're under total attack, so a lot of our projects haven't gotten off the ground, which is, again, seriously.
[00:42:36.437 --> 00:42:47.065]  I need our wonderful, awesome, incredible listeners to belly up to the bar and get a t-shirt, get a book, get some coffee, get some Secret 12, get some Rain Force, get some X3.
[00:42:47.065 --> 00:42:49.587]  Whatever you do, take advantage of these big sales.

[00:42:50.949 --> 00:42:52.470]  A few of these sales are about to end.

[00:47:04.204 --> 00:47:13.595]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:13.595 --> 00:47:18.520]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:22.405]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:29.076 --> 00:47:37.025]  Coming to you live from the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[00:47:37.025 --> 00:47:39.869]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:39.869 --> 00:47:43.193]  All right, some really big news broke during the break.
[00:47:43.193 --> 00:47:45.335]  No one has picked it up yet, to my knowledge.
[00:47:45.335 --> 00:47:46.216]  We were checking during the break.
[00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:54.964]  So, I'm going to print a few articles, some congressional hearing research during the next break, because I'm going to be dead sure about this.
[00:47:54.964 --> 00:47:56.105]  But this is a big deal.
[00:47:56.105 --> 00:47:59.087]  In fact, it's so big, I've got to get some ducks in a row.
[00:47:59.087 --> 00:48:00.469]  I'm not just going to release this information.
[00:48:02.848 --> 00:48:07.551]  The Office of the Inspector General just dropped a bombshell.
[00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:12.394]  It doesn't list the FBI agents, but we know their names, because I'm just double-checking.
[00:48:12.394 --> 00:48:29.005]  But this is filings of misconduct by FBI Special Supervisory Agent for making false representations, working for an FBI contractor, accepting gifts from FBI applicant, assisting the FBI applicant in the employment selection process, and misusing a government vehicle and cell phone.
[00:48:29.005 --> 00:48:30.125]  So there's more than one way to
[00:48:31.698 --> 00:48:34.739]  Skin a cat and a bunch of that is about to come out.
[00:48:34.739 --> 00:48:38.161]  And of course, that's in the news.
[00:48:38.161 --> 00:48:39.841]  They're not saying the name or names.
[00:48:39.841 --> 00:48:41.402]  We're going to give you those.
[00:48:41.402 --> 00:48:46.324]  It's not in the letter, but I remember who it is, but I'm going to make damn sure first.
[00:48:46.324 --> 00:48:53.086]  So that is coming up as soon as I have time to get my eyeballs down on the weeds to make sure that I don't give you anything wrong.
[00:48:53.086 --> 00:48:55.127]  Because I make mistakes sometimes.
[00:48:55.127 --> 00:48:56.208]  Don't do it on purpose.
[00:48:56.208 --> 00:48:56.588]  Believe me.
[00:48:57.472 --> 00:48:58.533]  He's talking about getting angry, man.
[00:48:58.533 --> 00:49:01.074]  When I mess up, I get really pissed.
[00:49:01.074 --> 00:49:10.260]  And sometimes it's just ridiculous, the mistakes I make, but... I get so much going on in my head, and then I'll think I know the answer, and then I just gotta have a little bit of time to slow down.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:11.160]  But you know what?
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.541]  That's not the nature of war, is it?
[00:49:12.541 --> 00:49:13.942]  It's the fog of war.
[00:49:13.942 --> 00:49:19.045]  That's why they call it a fog.
[00:49:19.045 --> 00:49:22.927]  And guys, I'm not looking for new articles about this.
[00:49:22.927 --> 00:49:24.268]  I know the name's not been released.
[00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:30.473]  The search parameters I gave you is when they admitted the names of who had already done it.
[00:49:30.473 --> 00:49:40.261]  Congress has the classified stuff and was basically publicly leaking what people should go look for in the bread trails, the breadcrumbs.
[00:49:40.261 --> 00:49:40.721]  Okay?
[00:49:40.721 --> 00:49:44.884]  So we already know who was implicated in taking the illegal gifts.
[00:49:44.884 --> 00:49:46.746]  So we don't want to click news, we want to click web.
[00:49:46.746 --> 00:49:49.428]  I may just have to go to rebroadcast if I do this.
[00:49:49.428 --> 00:49:50.769]  The crew's awesome.
[00:49:50.769 --> 00:49:54.611]  It's weird, archaic stuff to even be able to keep track of all this.
[00:49:56.283 --> 00:49:58.265]  I'm hot on this story.
[00:49:58.265 --> 00:50:03.088]  Who is in the recommendation for indictment is what I'm saying from the Inspector General.
[00:50:03.088 --> 00:50:04.429]  We know the names.
[00:50:04.429 --> 00:50:08.632]  We're going to give them to you as soon as I got two minutes to stick my head in the search engine.
[00:50:08.632 --> 00:50:14.817]  Okay, let's go ahead and tell you how to collate the cabbage.
[00:50:14.817 --> 00:50:19.140]  Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, not.
[00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.042]  The guy is dumb enough to say how much money he's got worth.
[00:50:21.042 --> 00:50:23.304]  The real money is hidden.
[00:50:23.304 --> 00:50:24.104]  Jeff Bezos,
[00:50:25.762 --> 00:50:28.305]  He gets $1.50 on every package he ships out.
[00:50:28.305 --> 00:50:28.965]  He's a globalist.
[00:50:28.965 --> 00:50:30.547]  He does all this bad stuff.
[00:50:30.547 --> 00:50:31.628]  But he's into himself.
[00:50:31.628 --> 00:50:33.049]  He's done this whole remodeling.
[00:50:33.049 --> 00:50:35.812]  He's this cool James Bond character and everything.
[00:50:35.812 --> 00:50:47.143]  So he spent millions of dollars on multiple ads at the Super Bowl about how he's a hero and journalists are heroes and all the rest of it.
[00:50:51.252 --> 00:50:54.773]  His own writers, who are being laid off, are having their pay cut.
[00:50:54.773 --> 00:51:00.134]  They're getting really, really, really, really upset about all of this.
[00:51:00.134 --> 00:51:03.814]  But, I mean, what a group of lying scum, anyways, the Washington Post.
[00:51:03.814 --> 00:51:07.635]  You work for scum, you are scum, stop complaining, mercenaries.
[00:51:07.635 --> 00:51:19.557]  And, of course, all the Obama funding, and Bezos is best buddies with him, to put out fake news and attack the free press and do all this, the main tranche, the main funding of that ran out last week.
[00:51:20.285 --> 00:51:23.647]  So that's why they're so upset, that's why they're so scared.
[00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:40.075]  So a listener has put together a great video that is a parody of this WAPO alternative Hanks video and let's go ahead and roll this powerful piece for you.
[00:51:40.075 --> 00:51:45.558]  When we go off to war, when we exercise our rights,
[00:51:48.519 --> 00:51:53.323]  When we soar to our greatest heights.
[00:51:53.323 --> 00:51:58.086]  When we mourn and pray.
[00:51:58.086 --> 00:52:01.949]  When our neighbors are at risk.
[00:52:01.949 --> 00:52:05.933]  When our nation is threatened.
[00:52:05.933 --> 00:52:08.114]  There's someone to gather the facts.
[00:52:08.114 --> 00:52:11.537]  To bring you the story.
[00:52:11.537 --> 00:52:15.160]  No matter the cost.
[00:52:17.782 --> 00:52:21.743]  This is why so many people can't stand the mainstream media.
[00:52:21.743 --> 00:52:25.324]  Because knowing empowers us.
[00:52:25.324 --> 00:52:28.665]  Knowing helps us decide.
[00:52:28.665 --> 00:52:35.567]  Knowing keeps us free.
[00:52:35.567 --> 00:52:42.868]  Yeah, a lot of the Washington Post has democracy dies in darkness and all they're trying to do is censor alternative media and shut down their competition.
[00:52:42.868 --> 00:52:44.449]  What a group of scum.
[00:52:45.319 --> 00:53:05.116]  We'll be covering the State of the Union tonight at Infowars.com forward slash show and any TV or radio stations want to pick it up, we'll have commercial free coverage 7 o'clock central for an hour before it goes live and then live coverage during all the applause and the rest of it at Infowars.com forward slash show or on the TV satellites and radio satellites of stations that's free to air.
[00:53:05.116 --> 00:53:06.557]  Please pick that up.
[00:53:07.816 --> 00:53:28.186]  Now, talking about the deep state funding of the fake media, talking about how all that's going on, talking about how that funding ran out, here's a boil down of my previous report that's very important, that's up on InfoWars.com, titled, please spread it, please share it, if you don't, nobody will, you are the victory, folks, you are the answer, you are the resistance.
[00:53:28.186 --> 00:53:31.148]  Deep state media money runs out.
[00:53:31.148 --> 00:53:31.568]  Here it is.
[00:53:32.935 --> 00:53:41.657]  We were the first to point out that the school kids from the Catholic school in Kentucky, the Covington kids, didn't start the fight.
[00:53:41.657 --> 00:53:44.898]  They had the fight started with them and did a great job standing down.
[00:53:44.898 --> 00:53:51.159]  How are you seeing unified corporate media with all the same headlines in the same order over and over again?
[00:53:51.159 --> 00:53:55.961]  I'm about to drop a huge bombshell on new listeners.
[00:53:55.961 --> 00:53:57.721]  This is coffin nails to the system.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:04.345]  Congress gets involved in this, the president takes action against this, it's game over.
[00:54:04.345 --> 00:54:13.714]  So this got pointed out by some of our researchers, Harrison Smith, and I went and looked it up and sure as Hades,
[00:54:15.174 --> 00:54:23.901]  I'd read the executive orders, I'd read the bill two years ago, two and a half years ago that Obama signed, and I'd forgotten that it elapsed and it ended last week.
[00:54:23.901 --> 00:54:34.910]  And that's why there were all the giant layoffs at dozens and dozens of major leftist, globalist propaganda outfits like BuzzFeed and Huffington Post and others.
[00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:38.473]  And more huge ones are set to be announced this week.
[00:54:38.473 --> 00:54:39.874]  Now why is that?
[00:54:39.874 --> 00:54:41.476]  Dr. McCamm shot please for TV viewers.
[00:54:42.452 --> 00:54:48.556]  This is out of Public Affairs, Washington Post, 2013, Obama.
[00:54:48.556 --> 00:54:54.100]  It's law passed legalizing CIA engaging in deception against the American people.
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:58.563]  The US repeals propaganda ban, spreads government-made news to Americans.
[00:54:58.563 --> 00:55:01.725]  Hiding in plain view, Obama signed that executive order.
[00:55:01.725 --> 00:55:09.551]  They passed a defense bill that he signed in December 2016, so two years and three months ago, and it gave billions of dollars
[00:55:10.632 --> 00:55:17.154]  Tranched out in 100 million, 200 million packages for what you've seen.
[00:55:17.154 --> 00:55:28.417]  So when you see all the TV shows demonizing Trump and Alex Jones, and you see every Netflix show, and you see Homeland, that was $2 billion of taxpayer money, and it's all right here.
[00:55:28.417 --> 00:55:32.418]  This is the scandal of scandals of scandals.
[00:55:32.418 --> 00:55:36.379]  And Trump was set to sign an executive order to kill it, but he never did.
[00:55:36.379 --> 00:55:36.899]  Well, guess what?
[00:55:38.860 --> 00:55:43.284]  Obama can only put defense spending out two years, that's how it is.
[00:55:43.284 --> 00:55:53.693]  So he signed in funding against Trump and America for all the disruption you see, not just against me, but the taken knees and the cop killing groups and Black Lives Matter, that's all.
[00:55:53.693 --> 00:55:57.376]  We have the documents funded to destabilize the country.
[00:55:57.376 --> 00:56:03.682]  So, think about how huge this is, and no one's reverse engineered this but us and Zero Hedge.
[00:56:04.946 --> 00:56:05.626]  So U.S.
[00:56:05.626 --> 00:56:13.209]  repeals propaganda ban, spreads government-made news to Americans, and it continues on from there.
[00:56:13.209 --> 00:56:16.470]  The NDAA legalizes the use of propaganda on U.S.
[00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:18.311]  citizens.
[00:56:18.311 --> 00:56:20.792]  Business Insider.
[00:56:20.792 --> 00:56:23.373]  Austin American Statesman.
[00:56:23.373 --> 00:56:23.693]  U.S.
[00:56:23.693 --> 00:56:27.674]  Senate panels okay funds to fight online propaganda 2016.
[00:56:30.486 --> 00:56:44.153]  And it says, 160 million dollars in the effort over the next two years, starting in late January, when the defense authorization rolls over, 2017, and rolling for two years, just ended last week.
[00:56:44.153 --> 00:56:44.393]  Boom.
[00:56:45.333 --> 00:56:47.493]  That's just one of the funding groups.
[00:56:47.493 --> 00:56:49.894]  And that's why those groups shut down.
[00:56:49.894 --> 00:56:54.715]  They were on record getting the money out of the Department of Defense.
[00:56:54.715 --> 00:56:57.255]  The left suddenly loves the Department of Defense.
[00:56:57.255 --> 00:56:59.215]  They suddenly love wars.
[00:56:59.215 --> 00:57:05.697]  They suddenly love keeping blacks in prison with three times the time that whites get.
[00:57:05.697 --> 00:57:07.177]  They're the ones that passed the bill in 93.
[00:57:07.177 --> 00:57:10.037]  They're the KKK.
[00:57:10.037 --> 00:57:12.058]  They're the baby organ harvesters.
[00:57:12.058 --> 00:57:13.198]  They're the bad guys.
[00:57:17.927 --> 00:57:20.189]  Okay, my plate is so full of incredible news.
[00:57:20.189 --> 00:57:23.291]  I don't know what I'm going to cover next when we start the next hour.
[00:57:23.291 --> 00:57:32.677]  But we have confirmed a whole bunch of recommendations for criminal indictments of Democrats in the whole fake Russiagate situation.
[00:57:32.677 --> 00:57:36.399]  So the criminal charges are about to happen.
[00:57:36.399 --> 00:57:37.039]  This is good.
[00:57:37.039 --> 00:57:38.120]  Trump is on the offense.
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:39.321]  This is good news.
[00:57:39.321 --> 00:57:40.081]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:40.081 --> 00:57:43.143]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:57:43.143 --> 00:57:44.544]  Please tell everyone you know about the broadcast.
[00:57:44.544 --> 00:57:47.006]  That's how we circumvent the censors.
[00:57:47.006 --> 00:57:47.266]  Please.
[00:57:58.652 --> 00:58:07.675]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:58:07.675 --> 00:58:17.737]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:58:17.737 --> 00:58:26.260]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.461]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:58:28.461 --> 00:58:29.622]  You must experience it.
[00:58:29.622 --> 00:58:31.703]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:58:31.703 --> 00:58:36.606]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:58:36.606 --> 00:58:38.127]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[00:58:38.127 --> 00:58:39.608]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:58:39.608 --> 00:58:46.313]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:58:46.313 --> 00:58:47.794]  TurboForce at m4slife.com.
[00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:58.231]  And InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[00:58:58.231 --> 00:59:11.600]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:16.503]  We also have another product, also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[00:59:16.503 --> 00:59:20.066]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.
[00:59:20.646 --> 00:59:29.753]  We're gonna go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:59:39.721 --> 00:59:42.843]  Again, this is a limited-time immune boost special.
[00:59:42.843 --> 00:59:49.368]  Get Super Blue, Silver Immune Gargle, and Super Silver Wound Dressing for 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:53.308 --> 01:00:00.754]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:00.754 --> 01:00:04.757]  Breakfast where the news is read.
[01:00:04.757 --> 01:00:08.479]  Television, children fed.
[01:00:08.479 --> 01:00:12.242]  Unborn, living, living dead.
[01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:16.565]  Bullard strikes the Helmholtz air.
[01:00:16.565 --> 01:00:18.226]  Oh, it's all over.
[01:00:21.619 --> 01:00:29.062]  It's all over for Hillary and Bill.
[01:00:29.062 --> 01:00:30.903]  Now she was intending to run again.
[01:00:30.903 --> 01:00:31.663]  That was real intel.
[01:00:31.663 --> 01:00:36.185]  But it's time for me to adjust to what happened.
[01:00:36.185 --> 01:00:38.846]  I said she intended to run.
[01:00:38.846 --> 01:00:41.828]  The Democrats have totally rejected her.
[01:00:41.828 --> 01:00:43.088]  Her funding's all run out.
[01:00:43.088 --> 01:00:45.809]  Their deep state funding, Obama's all run out.
[01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:49.251]  A group of insane crazed socialists have seized the party.
[01:00:51.149 --> 01:00:58.673]  And Hillary Clinton is not going to be running for president in 2020.
[01:00:58.673 --> 01:00:59.554]  All the numbers are there.
[01:00:59.554 --> 01:01:00.754]  The facts are there.
[01:01:00.754 --> 01:01:01.795]  She tried to do it.
[01:01:01.795 --> 01:01:03.536]  She would still control the party.
[01:01:03.536 --> 01:01:07.458]  She still had control of the money, but it's being taken away from her right now.
[01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:15.062]  And this is a good moment.
[01:01:15.062 --> 01:01:19.365]  In the words of Darth Vader, this will be a day long remembered.
[01:01:20.609 --> 01:01:22.489]  We've seen the end of Hillary.
[01:01:22.489 --> 01:01:26.170]  We'll soon see the end of George Soros.
[01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:29.291]  Evacuation on Moment of Triumph?
[01:01:29.291 --> 01:01:34.191]  I think you overestimate their chances.
[01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:36.092]  Okay.
[01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:40.913]  Maxine Meltdown Waters begs America to turn off TV during State of the Union.
[01:01:40.913 --> 01:01:42.753]  We're going to come back with that video.
[01:01:42.753 --> 01:01:45.694]  It's on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[01:01:45.694 --> 01:01:47.394]  Boy's name got him bullied.
[01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:53.536]  Trump's going to be defending him at the speeches, his last name's Trump.
[01:01:53.536 --> 01:02:02.720]  You know, I was thinking, if you had the last name Trump, which is just a German name, what must that be like?
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:07.982]  Because anti-Trumpers are such ignorant people, just a name means so much to them.
[01:02:07.982 --> 01:02:08.922]  See, I've always been lucky.
[01:02:08.922 --> 01:02:14.284]  I got such a common name that nobody blames me for, like, Jim Jones having the same name, the same last name.
[01:02:14.284 --> 01:02:18.486]  But, like, when you've got a rarer name like Trump,
[01:02:19.961 --> 01:02:23.283]  Or maybe Kaczynski?
[01:02:23.283 --> 01:02:29.707]  You're like, oh, what are you, the Unabomber?
[01:02:29.707 --> 01:02:31.908]  So that's coming up tonight, State of the Union.
[01:02:31.908 --> 01:02:32.708]  It's gonna be pretty amazing.
[01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:34.789]  We're gonna have live coverage.
[01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:35.510]  7 o'clock Central.
[01:02:39.003 --> 01:02:41.885]  And again, we're battling censorship, their attempt to shut us down.
[01:02:41.885 --> 01:02:51.332]  When you get excited about something as an audience, and you share it on your email or your text message, they can't censor that yet, or your Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
[01:02:51.332 --> 01:02:54.614]  Hey, see the censored State of the Union coverage tonight!
[01:02:54.614 --> 01:02:57.276]  That's what overdrives the enemy.
[01:02:57.276 --> 01:03:02.860]  So that we're in a position to break investigative journals in the future, to have reporters on the ground, it's amazing.
[01:03:04.144 --> 01:03:08.925]  You know, the Super Bowl was down by 30% because people are sick of race painting.
[01:03:08.925 --> 01:03:14.886]  Just with our auxiliary reporters, and I've really been keeping track of it because there's no monetization of it.
[01:03:14.886 --> 01:03:18.867]  We don't make money from it, which is what we need to fund things.
[01:03:18.867 --> 01:03:24.268]  Kaitlin Bennett alone had over 20 million views the last two weeks.
[01:03:24.268 --> 01:03:24.568]  20 million.
[01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:31.750]  That's 20 million eyeballs, or I guess that's 40 million eyeballs, that watched her.
[01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:32.730]  That's just one of our reporters.
[01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:38.590]  And you've got Will Johnson, you've got Millie Weaver, and all these other great people out there kicking butt.
[01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:41.050]  Owen Schroyer, tens of millions of views.
[01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:44.151]  And so we're fighting on.
[01:03:44.151 --> 01:03:58.534]  That's really my job, is administratively, to try to keep InfoWars here, our audience, funding the mothership, so that we can continue with the cadets, who are already winning great battles, doing better than we've done, out there earning their bones in the fight.
[01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.411]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I just keep going back to this.
[01:04:02.411 --> 01:04:03.972]  Thank you for your support.
[01:04:03.972 --> 01:04:08.374]  And remember, this is an epic fight, and your word of mouth is paramount.
[01:04:08.374 --> 01:04:14.337]  But above the mountaintop is the sky, and what's heavenly is your prayer.
[01:04:14.337 --> 01:04:16.117]  So, spreadin' the word's paramount.
[01:04:16.117 --> 01:04:17.418]  Financially supporting us is paramount.
[01:04:17.418 --> 01:04:18.659]  Get great products at the same time.
[01:04:18.659 --> 01:04:19.459]  Total win-win.
[01:04:19.459 --> 01:04:22.621]  But, 360 win.
[01:04:22.621 --> 01:04:24.661]  But above all that is those prayers.
[01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:25.462]  All right.
[01:04:26.741 --> 01:04:30.063]  We've got Gavin McGinnis with his big press conference we'll play clips of.
[01:04:30.063 --> 01:04:30.884]  He had yesterday.
[01:04:30.884 --> 01:04:31.725]  Soon the 7th of August.
[01:04:31.725 --> 01:04:32.345]  He's popping in.
[01:04:32.345 --> 01:04:40.932]  But I want to get to the waterfront when we come back on the other side of this quick break.

[01:06:16.525 --> 01:06:16.965]  Today.
[01:06:16.965 --> 01:06:31.648]  Big Brother.
[01:06:31.648 --> 01:06:33.449]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:33.449 --> 01:06:35.329]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:37.029]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:38.710]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:43.391]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:45.922 --> 01:06:47.006]  Yeah.
[01:06:51.178 --> 01:06:56.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, it doesn't happen very often, but I agree with Maxine Waters.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:00.642]  She has come out with a new video and ordered people not to watch the State of the Union.
[01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:03.083]  You heard Democrats say they shouldn't even have carried his Oval Office speech.
[01:07:03.083 --> 01:07:04.103]  I agree.
[01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:05.464]  He doesn't get free speech.
[01:07:05.464 --> 01:07:06.984]  InfoWars doesn't get free speech.
[01:07:06.984 --> 01:07:07.605]  You don't.
[01:07:07.605 --> 01:07:09.845]  Only Maxine Waters gets speech.
[01:07:09.845 --> 01:07:12.427]  I agree with this authoritarianism.
[01:07:12.427 --> 01:07:15.568]  America, sit down and shut up and accept world government.
[01:07:15.568 --> 01:07:17.749]  And hail our queen, Maxine Waters!
[01:07:17.749 --> 01:07:18.329]  Here she is!
[01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:22.442]  I don't even know why he wants to come and give the State of the Union.
[01:07:22.442 --> 01:07:25.582]  The State of the Union under him has not been good.
[01:07:25.582 --> 01:07:27.203]  And he has been divisive.
[01:07:27.203 --> 01:07:29.763]  And I think he's putting us all in harm's way.
[01:07:29.763 --> 01:07:32.564]  And so he's not worthy of being listened to.
[01:07:32.564 --> 01:07:36.105]  I don't know why anybody want to pay attention to anything that he has to say.
[01:07:36.105 --> 01:07:37.805]  He lies over and over again.
[01:07:37.805 --> 01:07:41.746]  Like I said, 6,000 lies have been documented since he's been there.
[01:07:41.746 --> 01:07:44.986]  I just can't imagine what he's going to try and say.
[01:07:44.986 --> 01:07:47.567]  But since he is a great liar, he'll say anything.
[01:07:48.167 --> 01:07:52.589]  Because he's capable of saying anything without facts, without research.
[01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:59.313]  And so, I'm not looking forward to his State of the Union, and I hope that people will turn the television off.
[01:07:59.313 --> 01:08:01.874]  Yeah, like you've turned internet freedom off and all the rest of it.
[01:08:01.874 --> 01:08:02.914]  I mean, what a monster.
[01:08:02.914 --> 01:08:08.077]  And they always just show like 10,000 lies, 5 million lies, like 20 containers of gumballs.
[01:08:08.077 --> 01:08:11.579]  These are all lies from a pack of liars.
[01:08:11.579 --> 01:08:14.340]  Or they play games, like he said there's a mile high burgers.
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.021]  There was only 2,000 hamburgers.
[01:08:16.952 --> 01:08:17.933]  It's hyperbole!
[01:08:17.933 --> 01:08:23.097]  It's like saying somebody knocked it out of the park because they got an A+.
[01:08:23.097 --> 01:08:27.981]  They didn't literally knock a baseball out of the park like Babe Ruth.
[01:08:27.981 --> 01:08:31.383]  Unbelievable crap from that lunatic woman.
[01:08:31.383 --> 01:08:31.944]  Well, guess what?
[01:08:31.944 --> 01:08:35.927]  Let me look at the camera real quick.
[01:08:35.927 --> 01:08:39.710]  Maxine Waters has commanded us not to watch the State of the Union.
[01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:40.731]  We're about to play the video.
[01:08:40.731 --> 01:08:41.792]  And I agree with her.
[01:08:41.792 --> 01:08:42.953]  There's no First Amendment in America.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:45.220]  Don't listen to Trump.
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:47.302]  Just believe her when she says he's a liar.
[01:08:47.302 --> 01:08:48.843]  Just believe her.
[01:08:48.843 --> 01:08:50.624]  Just believe in mainstream media.
[01:08:50.624 --> 01:08:51.724]  Just do it.
[01:08:51.724 --> 01:08:54.466]  And don't watch tonight at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:08:55.219 --> 01:08:56.080]  Whatever you do, Donald.
[01:09:17.677 --> 01:09:19.258]  This is the demoralization of America.
[01:09:19.258 --> 01:09:26.802]  If you wonder, the scum that Globalist would hire to swindle America, to bankrupt America, to raise interest rates, to stop the recovery, this is it.
[01:09:26.802 --> 01:09:30.163]  You wanna look at the bottom of the barrel, folks?
[01:09:30.163 --> 01:09:39.988]  It's Maxine Waters, with all her $5 million homes and Bentleys and everything, and her husband getting all that bailout money from her, direct cash to his bank.
[01:09:39.988 --> 01:09:43.310]  This is a hateful, arrogant, crazed demon.
[01:09:44.753 --> 01:09:50.115]  Who is only pissed that Trump is trying to remove this tick from our neck.
[01:09:50.115 --> 01:09:53.456]  Wow.
[01:09:53.456 --> 01:09:58.437]  Does she give Trump credit for trying to get black folks out of prison or try to end the wars?
[01:09:58.437 --> 01:10:00.758]  No, she supports the wars.
[01:10:00.758 --> 01:10:04.699]  She supports Hillary that said black men are super predators.
[01:10:04.699 --> 01:10:05.119]  Because listen,
[01:10:06.966 --> 01:10:17.069]  It went back to the Romans, and it went back to the sugarcane plantations 400 years ago in the Caribbean, and to the South where 1% of the population had slaves.
[01:10:17.069 --> 01:10:25.932]  The establishment always tries to find a black lady as the Judas Goat to go out and to lead black families into slavery.
[01:10:27.369 --> 01:10:29.790]  She is the house slave of the globalists.
[01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:34.333]  Maxine Waters is a house slave to make sure the blacks get aborted.
[01:10:34.333 --> 01:10:48.501]  She's the house slave to make sure that you never get a job, to make sure you make your trip as quickly as possible right to prison for her lord and savior, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who says that blacks are super predators.
[01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:49.762]  They need to be brought to heel.
[01:10:49.762 --> 01:10:51.883]  In fact, can we queue that up?
[01:10:51.883 --> 01:10:54.105]  Because that's an actual video.
[01:10:54.105 --> 01:10:55.946]  I mean, just imagine if anybody else said that.
[01:10:57.622 --> 01:11:07.444]  But see, Hillary can, because, well, you know, she's Hillary Clinton, so she's allowed to do whatever she wants.
[01:11:07.444 --> 01:11:11.766]  Bill Markins say the N-word, Bill Markins say he likes pedophilia, doesn't get in trouble.
[01:11:11.766 --> 01:11:13.826]  Anybody else does it, you got a problem.
[01:11:13.826 --> 01:11:16.067]  Because look at her, just look at how ugly she is.
[01:11:16.067 --> 01:11:23.749]  And I don't mean just because she's old, but the total, now go back to the earlier photo, the total disconnect with reality.
[01:11:23.749 --> 01:11:25.329]  It was the photo before that, two photos before that.
[01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:27.489]  I mean, look at her.
[01:11:27.489 --> 01:11:28.070]  Just look at that.
[01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:30.211]  It's like a great white shark.
[01:11:30.211 --> 01:11:31.371]  Back it up one.
[01:11:31.371 --> 01:11:35.133]  A great white shark just cresting out of the water.
[01:11:35.133 --> 01:11:38.575]  It's just a psychotic demon from hell.
[01:11:38.575 --> 01:11:40.455]  Like, I've invaded your planet.
[01:11:40.455 --> 01:11:41.656]  War, death, murder.
[01:11:41.656 --> 01:11:45.838]  I love it!
[01:11:45.838 --> 01:11:47.599]  The earth will serve us well.
[01:11:47.599 --> 01:11:49.560]  Prepare operations for destruction.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:56.063]  It's an actual dialed-in transmission from Hillary.
[01:11:57.657 --> 01:12:01.361]  You know, I was the first to point out that she looks like a great white shark cresting.
[01:12:01.361 --> 01:12:04.004]  Now it's a luscious, juicy meme.
[01:12:04.004 --> 01:12:10.350]  Let me get serious.
[01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:12.492]  Gavin McGinnis is popping in after his big press conference yesterday.
[01:12:12.492 --> 01:12:16.236]  We're going to play some clips of that.
[01:12:16.236 --> 01:12:20.781]  But the first big thing I want to do is just tell you some of the other big news that's coming up here.
[01:12:23.857 --> 01:12:29.439]  I mentioned it last hour, but I think this is something that should be re-mentioned because it's so big.
[01:12:29.439 --> 01:12:48.846]  Mitch McConnell and the Republicans and the Democrats passed a near-unanimous resolution to continue maximum troop deployment in Afghanistan and Syria, despite the fact that they admit there's no strategic value in it and that it's for globalism and that we're basically China's mercenaries.
[01:12:50.538 --> 01:12:52.259]  So that story's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:12:52.259 --> 01:12:55.520]  Very, very sick.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:10.405]  Meanwhile, China to gorge on double-muscle frankenswine pigs after ditching fat.
[01:13:10.405 --> 01:13:15.027]  And when you look at these pigs, they're genetically engineered to not have fat.
[01:13:21.019 --> 01:13:27.644]  And the government has ordered people to come out with these.
[01:13:27.644 --> 01:13:41.755]  The government has ordered the population to breed these cloned chimera pigs that have all sorts of bizarre neck engineering put into them.
[01:13:41.755 --> 01:13:44.097]  And so this just shows that China has no bottom.
[01:13:44.097 --> 01:13:44.997]  The bottom has fallen out.
[01:13:44.997 --> 01:13:46.819]  They've got chickens that they breed in China.
[01:13:49.076 --> 01:13:55.781]  That don't have wings, they have nothing but four legs.
[01:13:55.781 --> 01:13:59.084]  And so the government's banning traditional pigs because they have fat on them.
[01:13:59.084 --> 01:13:59.965]  I mean, look at that video.
[01:13:59.965 --> 01:14:01.346]  Click on that video of those franken-pigs.
[01:14:01.346 --> 01:14:09.773]  I mean, that looks like something out of a nightmare vision of hell.
[01:14:09.773 --> 01:14:13.155]  So, that's what's going on in the world.
[01:14:13.155 --> 01:14:14.256]  And this is just the beginning.
[01:14:14.256 --> 01:14:15.757]  I remember like 10 years ago on the BBC,
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:22.822]  China now has human milk produced by cows that are part human, and the milk's identical to human milk.
[01:14:22.822 --> 01:14:23.742]  Yeah, right.
[01:14:23.742 --> 01:14:28.043]  And it's being sold in stores as baby's milk.
[01:14:28.043 --> 01:14:32.865]  And this is just the stuff they're showing you.
[01:14:32.865 --> 01:14:34.965]  This is just the stuff they're showing you.
[01:14:34.965 --> 01:14:41.307]  Record profits puts new bullseye on tech giants.
[01:14:41.307 --> 01:14:42.708]  Absolutely.
[01:14:42.708 --> 01:14:43.648]  And then when we come back,
[01:14:45.998 --> 01:14:54.885]  There's big articles out here dealing with the fact that women's brains are different than men's.
[01:14:54.885 --> 01:14:58.308]  And then there's even a discussion, are we allowed to say that?
[01:14:58.308 --> 01:14:58.808]  I don't know.
[01:14:58.808 --> 01:14:59.769]  Are women different than men?
[01:14:59.769 --> 01:15:01.170]  They have a uterus.
[01:15:01.170 --> 01:15:03.372]  They have a totally different cycle.
[01:15:03.372 --> 01:15:05.913]  They're our species.
[01:15:05.913 --> 01:15:07.675]  And you have straight up scientific journals going,
[01:15:09.468 --> 01:15:14.971]  Are we to say in the journals that women have vaginas and uteruses?
[01:15:14.971 --> 01:15:18.052]  And they sit around with straight faces going, is it offensive?
[01:15:18.052 --> 01:15:21.394]  That's the total cult brainwashing.
[01:15:21.394 --> 01:15:26.356]  Right as all the GMO floods and all the transhuman and human clones, they've got us so confused.
[01:15:26.356 --> 01:15:34.560]  You can't say men and women exist or families exist, but you can have Franken pigs and Franken cows and human clones for their organs and kill political dissidents.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.121]  They're just frying everything.
[01:15:36.601 --> 01:15:40.084]  They're telling moral people mothers and fathers and families are bad.
[01:15:40.084 --> 01:15:41.466]  They don't exist.
[01:15:41.466 --> 01:15:47.091]  But Frankenpigs and Frankenchickens, they do.
[01:15:47.091 --> 01:15:53.517]  You can just see the little gremlins at their transmission tables, interfacing with San Francisco.
[01:15:53.517 --> 01:15:55.880]  Like a big video game for them as they tear the planet apart.
[01:15:57.079 --> 01:16:03.442]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.442 --> 01:16:06.483]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.483 --> 01:16:12.406]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.406 --> 01:16:16.187]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.187 --> 01:16:17.448]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:17.448 --> 01:16:18.808]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:18.808 --> 01:16:24.991]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:24.991 --> 01:16:26.432]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:27.072 --> 01:16:30.955]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[01:16:57.052 --> 01:16:58.274]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:16:58.274 --> 01:17:02.200]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.743]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:03.743 --> 01:17:06.708]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:06.708 --> 01:17:11.916]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:12.256 --> 01:17:13.436]  I can help you too.

[01:18:16.446 --> 01:18:26.528]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[01:18:38.394 --> 01:18:40.356]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:18:40.356 --> 01:18:45.401]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:18:45.401 --> 01:18:46.923]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:18:46.923 --> 01:18:48.404]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:18:48.404 --> 01:18:55.091]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[01:19:24.898 --> 01:19:36.344]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[01:19:36.344 --> 01:19:45.488]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[01:19:45.768 --> 01:19:47.188]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:19.289 --> 01:20:21.930]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:38.934]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:41.474]  So this is the way modern psychology works.
[01:20:41.474 --> 01:20:43.935]  This is the way the psych warfare system operates.
[01:20:45.851 --> 01:21:00.275]  They get the corporate media lined up with a set of talking points, and then they will target a few people out in the general public to be attacked, to be demonized, to be destroyed, based on a lie.
[01:21:00.275 --> 01:21:13.159]  And then once they've done that, they can then start targeting other people who will then prostrate themselves on the ground, begging, saying, please don't come after me next, and now they've got a stampede of fear going.
[01:21:14.704 --> 01:21:29.456]  And then no matter how many mentally ill, you know, six foot four linebacker dudes in pink shirts go in and tear up stores and physically attack people saying, I'm a ma'am, you must bow down to it.
[01:21:29.456 --> 01:21:34.660]  And then the general public sees that and says, well, this is total mental illness, but I better go ahead and submit to it.
[01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:39.144]  And at that point, there's a total collapse in the society.
[01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:41.446]  So cults always try to get you to do weird stuff.
[01:21:42.452 --> 01:21:44.573]  Because if you'll do it, you'll do anything.
[01:21:44.573 --> 01:21:45.834]  So this is all cult programming.
[01:21:45.834 --> 01:21:52.037]  This has all been cooked up by the cults that are modern psychology, modern psychiatry.
[01:21:52.037 --> 01:22:01.262]  And now it's gotten to the point where they have major scientific journals and others, I have the articles right here, going, it's time to change medical books.
[01:22:02.932 --> 01:22:10.197]  You can't have men and women because if you have men and women, some people aren't men and women, it hurts them that you're a man or a woman and you're so privileged.
[01:22:10.197 --> 01:22:17.643]  So we can't actually have medical books about how to do surgery on a cervix because it doesn't exist.
[01:22:17.643 --> 01:22:21.726]  You're like, this sounds like comedy.
[01:22:21.726 --> 01:22:24.988]  But see, they mean business.
[01:22:24.988 --> 01:22:28.811]  This is mass designed mental illness.
[01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:31.052]  And so imagine the sun is yellow.
[01:22:31.052 --> 01:22:31.793]  It's a yellow star.
[01:22:34.761 --> 01:22:36.062]  It's a yellow star.
[01:22:36.062 --> 01:22:46.046]  Well, what if someone wasn't yellow, and they said, well, it hurts my feelings I'm not yellow, so the sun can't be yellow because someone else isn't yellow.
[01:22:46.046 --> 01:22:49.728]  Google said last week, we're looking at how to control the name family.
[01:22:49.728 --> 01:22:55.231]  Other people may not have them, so if you use the word, it can be hurtful.
[01:22:55.231 --> 01:22:56.551]  Well, that's mentally ill.
[01:22:56.551 --> 01:22:57.712]  No, it makes perfect sense.
[01:22:57.712 --> 01:22:58.812]  You're attacking language.
[01:22:58.812 --> 01:22:59.773]  You're attacking words.
[01:23:00.916 --> 01:23:07.978]  To where if you try to type it on your Android phone, words you're not supposed to, it won't let you do it.
[01:23:07.978 --> 01:23:09.559]  That's the total control.
[01:23:09.559 --> 01:23:14.640]  And if they'll get you to say family doesn't exist, well then nothing exists.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:27.684]  So there's an article out of Newark Mag, The Nature of Sex, and it says, suddenly feminist groups are mad that men are showing up in bathrooms and little girls showers and saying they're women.
[01:23:27.684 --> 01:23:29.265]  No, women are saying we're women.
[01:23:30.455 --> 01:23:34.516]  See, first they get women to divide themselves from the family, and say, we're women, hear me roar!
[01:23:34.516 --> 01:23:39.276]  Now they're like, well, actually, I'm a man, hear me roar, I'm a woman.
[01:23:39.276 --> 01:23:44.317]  So they taught women in the early phase using territorialism to say, I'm women, I'm not man.
[01:23:44.317 --> 01:23:45.758]  When we're all in one community, really.
[01:23:45.758 --> 01:23:48.358]  You're an individual, but you're part of a communal.
[01:23:48.358 --> 01:23:50.318]  But once they did that, now they're like, no, no, no, no.
[01:23:50.318 --> 01:23:53.859]  Now you are not a woman or a man.
[01:23:53.859 --> 01:23:59.580]  And feminists are like, no, I'm all into women power and women, and women are separate from men.
[01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:04.451]  We got uteruses, blah, blah, blah.
[01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:06.592]  We've got mitochondrial DNA, men don't even have it.
[01:24:06.592 --> 01:24:07.433]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:07.433 --> 01:24:09.614]  Women, really figure out why you're targeted.
[01:24:09.614 --> 01:24:12.917]  The folks telling you, I mean, articles, can men get pregnant?
[01:24:12.917 --> 01:24:19.040]  All of this is just, oh look, two penguins are gay because a male penguin's taking care of an egg.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.142]  That's what penguins do.
[01:24:21.142 --> 01:24:24.064]  Male penguins take care of eggs, even if it's not theirs.
[01:24:24.064 --> 01:24:30.588]  If a tiger seal eats a male penguin, another penguin takes over the egg.
[01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:36.774]  But everywhere nationwide, look at the gay penguin, he's taking care of an egg.
[01:24:36.774 --> 01:24:41.341]  Everything is to jack with your kids, to screw you up.
[01:24:41.341 --> 01:24:41.501]  So...
[01:24:42.694 --> 01:24:56.086]  It might be a sign of the end times, or simply a function of our currently scrambled politics, but earlier this week, four feminist activists, three from a self-described radical feminist organization, Women's Liberation Front, appeared on a panel at the Heritage Foundation.
[01:24:56.086 --> 01:25:02.813]  Together, they argued that sex was fundamentally biological, and not socially constructed, and that there is a
[01:25:04.582 --> 01:25:09.386]  There's a difference between men and women, and trans women, that needs to be represented and respected.
[01:25:09.386 --> 01:25:13.910]  Yeah, in Japan, if you're gonna call yourself a woman, you gotta at least cut your genitals off.
[01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:19.914]  You're not really a woman, you're a eunuch now, but okay, you put some skin in the game, you can call yourself a woman.
[01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:26.900]  For this, they were given a rousing round of applause by the Trump supporters, religious right members, natural law theorists, and conservative intellectuals.
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:28.702]  And it goes on.
[01:25:28.702 --> 01:25:30.003]  What, 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[01:25:32.056 --> 01:25:34.838]  But again, it's a total attack on reason.
[01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:36.499]  Attack on the West.
[01:25:36.499 --> 01:25:39.300]  In fact, let's play the audio of the standing ovation.
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:46.485]  And this is what upsets the left, like, we say the emperor has new clothes, they point out he's naked, and they're getting together, and the left isn't buying it.
[01:25:46.485 --> 01:25:49.046]  Well, my God, how far are you gonna go?
[01:25:49.046 --> 01:25:55.810]  It's all about Nambla admits this, saying, well, I identify as a child, Nambla says, so I can have sex with your five-year-old.
[01:25:55.810 --> 01:25:59.473]  And it's some 400-pound gross dude.
[01:25:59.473 --> 01:26:01.554]  It's not dude, it's baby boy!
[01:26:04.761 --> 01:26:07.084]  And so this is all just part of the mental illness.
[01:26:07.084 --> 01:26:12.832]  Where you'll have a woman that says she's turned into a man, and then they get pregnant, so they say a man's having a baby.
[01:26:12.832 --> 01:26:17.337]  No, you're a woman that says they're a man that's having a baby.
[01:26:17.337 --> 01:26:20.321]  Who we're sure you're gonna screw up.
[01:26:20.321 --> 01:26:22.484]  Let's bring in the rest of the story.
[01:26:22.484 --> 01:26:23.085]  Here's The Guardian.
[01:26:25.362 --> 01:26:28.324]  Women's brains are four years younger than men's.
[01:26:28.324 --> 01:26:30.625]  Yeah, they live four years longer on average, too.
[01:26:30.625 --> 01:26:33.807]  Baby girls are stronger and live longer than boys.
[01:26:33.807 --> 01:26:34.668]  That's all known.
[01:26:34.668 --> 01:26:36.389]  Women's blood-brain barriers are stronger.
[01:26:36.389 --> 01:26:38.010]  Yeah, women are different.
[01:26:38.010 --> 01:26:44.213]  Women have a whole double set of DNA the scientists came to figure out.
[01:26:44.213 --> 01:26:51.398]  Meanwhile, women's brains are nearly four years younger than men's, at least in how they burn fuel according to scans performed by researchers.
[01:26:53.848 --> 01:26:56.589]  But then the question is, is it okay to even call them women?
[01:26:56.589 --> 01:27:00.390]  This is like a fever dream, but it's the takedown plan.
[01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:04.611]  I don't know, is my mom different than my dad?
[01:27:04.611 --> 01:27:06.812]  This is how you take a civilization over.
[01:27:06.812 --> 01:27:12.393]  Obesity related, NBC News, cancer rises fastest among American Millennial study finds.
[01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:17.915]  Oh yeah, children and young people never just get cancer, now you do.
[01:27:17.915 --> 01:27:20.456]  You just keep taking those vaccines though.
[01:27:20.456 --> 01:27:21.356]  Bye bye Blue Bird.
[01:27:22.887 --> 01:27:27.772]  Doctors surprised by scope of adult onset food allergies.
[01:27:27.772 --> 01:27:32.678]  Why are allergies not just peanuts but thousands of foods killing people now because we're eating GMO?
[01:27:34.099 --> 01:27:40.464]  It puts our body into a hyperimmune situation and it triggers it, which we've had scientists on for 20 years telling you.
[01:27:40.464 --> 01:27:53.395]  Tomorrow's news today, oh, France24.com, gut feeling, study links depression to digestive bacteria and autism, which the doctor that first exposed that, they removed his medical license, which he got back.
[01:27:56.021 --> 01:28:18.008]  Because it goes in with an enzyme released by the vaccine autoimmune response, fries your gut, your gut begins to create a toxicity because the measles, mumps, rubella creates a autoimmune response to regular gut bacteria, essentially destroying your gut and creates toxins that boys
[01:28:19.031 --> 01:28:21.952]  Are eight times more likely to not be able to stop.
[01:28:21.952 --> 01:28:23.692]  Girls have a blood-brain barrier.
[01:28:23.692 --> 01:28:24.892]  Oh, they're still going to get cancer.
[01:28:24.892 --> 01:28:26.872]  They're still going to have major problems down the road.
[01:28:26.872 --> 01:28:31.673]  But the girls are so tough that their brains block it!
[01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:35.514]  Takes about five times the vaccines to kill a girl than it does a boy.
[01:28:35.514 --> 01:28:36.894]  But don't worry, they kill them.
[01:28:36.894 --> 01:28:37.674]  And kill them aplenty.
[01:28:37.674 --> 01:28:39.795]  Including people's kids in this building.
[01:28:39.795 --> 01:28:41.895]  And they want to kill your kids next.
[01:28:41.895 --> 01:28:45.396]  So you better damn well know that's why they want me off here.
[01:28:45.396 --> 01:28:46.756]  I just let it all out to you, didn't I?
[01:28:47.773 --> 01:28:49.116]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:49.116 --> 01:28:51.080]  Spread this video later if you want to save some lives.
[01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.845]  I want to thank you all for joining the team and coming in for the big win.
[01:28:57.079 --> 01:28:59.461]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[01:28:59.461 --> 01:29:02.324]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[01:29:02.324 --> 01:29:07.409]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[01:29:07.409 --> 01:29:14.575]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[01:29:14.575 --> 01:29:19.140]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[01:29:19.722 --> 01:29:23.364]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[01:29:23.364 --> 01:29:26.486]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[01:29:26.486 --> 01:29:29.127]  It hit me when I was arrested.

[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.341]  Hashtag Alex Jones.

[01:31:58.405 --> 01:32:09.008]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:09.008 --> 01:32:11.068]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:11.068 --> 01:32:13.929]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:13.929 --> 01:32:15.410]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:22.251]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:22.251 --> 01:32:23.472]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:32:24.332 --> 01:32:34.015]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:50.840]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[01:32:54.141 --> 01:33:01.212]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:33:01.212 --> 01:33:03.836]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.141 --> 01:33:18.782]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:18.782 --> 01:33:27.985]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.985 --> 01:33:30.745]  Human destiny.
[01:33:30.745 --> 01:33:32.226]  Free will.
[01:33:32.226 --> 01:33:33.846]  That's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:35.057 --> 01:33:37.298]  Yeah, McGuinness is having some microphone problems.
[01:33:37.298 --> 01:33:38.319]  He's back at his home studio.
[01:33:38.319 --> 01:33:39.940]  We're getting him lined up here.
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:40.841]  Let's just go to phone, guys.
[01:33:40.841 --> 01:33:42.102]  It's no big deal.
[01:33:42.102 --> 01:33:45.284]  Here in the next few minutes.
[01:33:45.284 --> 01:33:49.326]  But let me mention some of the other news here that I've got in front of us.
[01:33:49.326 --> 01:33:59.893]  We're going to be here tonight, 7 o'clock Central, 8 o'clock Eastern, for an hour, leading up to the State of the Union with the President tonight.
[01:33:59.893 --> 01:34:00.953]  This is going to be a big deal.
[01:34:02.208 --> 01:34:04.349]  And again, it's a great way for us to reach out to new people.
[01:34:04.349 --> 01:34:08.871]  You're going to be watching our live feeds on local TV or listening on radio.
[01:34:08.871 --> 01:34:20.997]  However you're listening or watching, tell folks about it and share the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show and we'll have the link up on the front page of NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com when we carry this.
[01:34:20.997 --> 01:34:21.677]  It's so important.
[01:34:21.677 --> 01:34:25.419]  We reach out to people and say, hey, hear what the president actually has to say because
[01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:30.410]  People like Mad Maxine are saying, don't watch it, turn it off.
[01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:35.515]  The Democrats have also said, you know, don't even let him have Oval Office discussions.
[01:34:35.515 --> 01:34:44.845]  Mitch McConnell's basically threatened impeachment and passed a resolution saying, if you try to pull our troops out of Syria or Afghanistan, we'll impeach you.
[01:34:45.842 --> 01:34:50.445]  I mean, it's supposed to be the President that's over these wars, and Congress that funds them.
[01:34:50.445 --> 01:34:55.548]  And so, just, we're seeing a lot of bizarre globalist behavior right now.
[01:34:55.548 --> 01:34:56.289]  But I for one...
[01:34:57.591 --> 01:35:00.913]  I'm very, very proud of the President for what he's been doing.
[01:35:00.913 --> 01:35:05.136]  And I rarely play a clip twice in the same show.
[01:35:05.136 --> 01:35:10.319]  The full 15-minute video is up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:35:10.319 --> 01:35:15.482]  In a Don Salazar article, Rand Paul lashes out against forever wars.
[01:35:15.482 --> 01:35:18.284]  Our military do not want to be the policemen of the world.
[01:35:18.284 --> 01:35:22.006]  Very powerful 16-minute video on Infowars.com.
[01:35:22.006 --> 01:35:23.267]  It'll only get out if you get it out.
[01:35:24.701 --> 01:35:26.903]  I mean, where's the left not wanting all these illegal wars?
[01:35:26.903 --> 01:35:30.946]  Where's the left not wanting blacks to get three times the prison sentence of whites?
[01:35:30.946 --> 01:35:34.089]  Trump's into it all, and they want his impeachment.
[01:35:34.089 --> 01:35:40.795]  I mean, that is so Twilight Zone or Black Mirror or Outer Limits for me.
[01:35:41.874 --> 01:35:52.421]  To just, to know that Trump's just trying to turn the economy on and trying to get us better deals and trying to get all these secret technologies declassified and the deep states hijacked America.
[01:35:52.421 --> 01:35:53.582]  It's like, no, you're not doing that.
[01:35:53.582 --> 01:35:56.003]  We own and run this man.
[01:35:56.003 --> 01:36:01.327]  China gets over a hundred billion dollars a year of rare earth minerals out of Afghanistan.
[01:36:01.327 --> 01:36:01.987]  We get zero.
[01:36:01.987 --> 01:36:03.008]  We pay to protect it.
[01:36:04.747 --> 01:36:07.249]  On average, over $100 billion a year in the last 18 years.
[01:36:07.249 --> 01:36:09.050]  17 and a half years.
[01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:11.171]  And then China gets all the stuff.
[01:36:11.171 --> 01:36:15.854]  I mean, I'd still be against it if we were getting all the rare earth minerals.
[01:36:15.854 --> 01:36:17.035]  But China's been giving the monopoly.
[01:36:17.035 --> 01:36:19.116]  Like, okay, well, we're there for the minerals.
[01:36:19.116 --> 01:36:19.897]  It's still immoral.
[01:36:19.897 --> 01:36:20.577]  Let's get out of there.
[01:36:20.577 --> 01:36:29.643]  But it makes it worse that we pay for it and we die and people get their arms and legs blown off and get sent home in pine boxes to mommy and daddy.
[01:36:32.239 --> 01:36:33.700]  It's insane.
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:34.801]  I looked the numbers up.
[01:36:34.801 --> 01:36:38.983]  We spend $100 billion on average in the last 17 years.
[01:36:38.983 --> 01:36:42.445]  So it's approaching $2 trillion.
[01:36:42.445 --> 01:36:44.326]  And it's been cut under Trump.
[01:36:44.326 --> 01:36:49.329]  So it's down to $54 billion a year.
[01:36:49.329 --> 01:36:52.051]  That's five times the complete wall.
[01:36:52.051 --> 01:36:55.293]  And again, the sports stadiums, the last decade, $40 billion.
[01:36:55.293 --> 01:36:56.234]  I looked it up.
[01:36:56.234 --> 01:36:56.734]  David was saying $35.
[01:36:56.734 --> 01:36:57.214]  $40 billion smackers.
[01:37:02.670 --> 01:37:05.773]  40 billion smackers.
[01:37:05.773 --> 01:37:10.537]  40 billion dollars for sports stadiums that these billionaires get built for free.
[01:37:10.537 --> 01:37:15.121]  Hey, if your football team is so damn important, you pay for it!
[01:37:15.121 --> 01:37:17.203]  Oh, but we don't have money to build a wall.
[01:37:17.203 --> 01:37:23.828]  We can just build 40 billion dollars of sports stadiums.
[01:37:23.828 --> 01:37:27.751]  So let's go to the Rand Paul clip here because this is so important.
[01:37:27.751 --> 01:37:30.554]  Two minute boil down where he lays it out and I totally agree with him.
[01:37:32.369 --> 01:37:34.130]  Is Afghanistan a mess?
[01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:35.532]  Sure it's a mess.
[01:37:35.532 --> 01:37:39.715]  It's always been a mess and always will be a mess.
[01:37:39.715 --> 01:37:44.218]  But now our mission has changed to nation building.
[01:37:44.218 --> 01:37:50.143]  I want to compliment President Trump for being bold and brave in saying enough's enough.
[01:37:50.143 --> 01:37:52.245]  Let's spend that money at home.
[01:37:52.245 --> 01:37:56.928]  We spend 51 billion dollars a year in Afghanistan.
[01:37:56.928 --> 01:37:58.309]  That money could be spent at home.
[01:37:59.090 --> 01:38:01.752]  I've got three members of my family in the military.
[01:38:01.752 --> 01:38:04.714]  I don't want them to go to Afghanistan.
[01:38:04.714 --> 01:38:16.221]  Every one of our political and military leaders, Republican, Democrat and Independent, will tell you there is no military mission in Afghanistan and yet we stay.
[01:38:16.221 --> 01:38:22.506]  Some of the very same people who say we have no mission in the next breath say we need to send more troops there.
[01:38:23.246 --> 01:38:29.229]  We sent 100,000 and we completely had victory and then they came back as our troops came down.
[01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:33.691]  Are we to send 100,000 and keep them there forever?
[01:38:33.691 --> 01:38:37.573]  This resolution is an insult to the President and I will oppose it.
[01:38:37.573 --> 01:38:45.816]  This resolution is put forward by Republicans who say to President Trump that you are leaving precipitously from Afghanistan.
[01:38:45.816 --> 01:38:47.877]  How do you leave precipitously after 17 years?
[01:38:50.678 --> 01:38:51.739]  17 years!
[01:38:51.739 --> 01:38:55.740]  We are no longer fighting anyone who attacked us on 9-11!
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:39:00.321]  The people we are fighting were not even born when 9-11 happened!
[01:39:00.321 --> 01:39:04.102]  The war over there has nothing to do with 9-11!
[01:39:04.102 --> 01:39:05.743]  It has to do with nation building!
[01:39:06.483 --> 01:39:09.785]  And I'll tell you what one Navy SEAL told me that I met a year or two ago.
[01:39:09.785 --> 01:39:11.547]  He says, we'll go anywhere.
[01:39:11.547 --> 01:39:12.607]  We'll kill our enemy.
[01:39:12.607 --> 01:39:14.589]  We'll do what you ask of us.
[01:39:14.589 --> 01:39:20.332]  But the mistake is when you ask us to stay, plant the flag, and become policemen.
[01:39:20.332 --> 01:39:21.853]  They don't want to be policemen.
[01:39:21.853 --> 01:39:25.336]  Our military do not want to be the policemen of the world.
[01:39:25.336 --> 01:39:27.978]  We fight when we have to and we should come home.
[01:39:27.978 --> 01:39:29.779]  That money should be spent here at home.
[01:39:31.578 --> 01:39:39.904]  There's still some good people, you know, and I'm mad at Trump for not going after Deep State more, and for not going after the vaccines more, and some things.
[01:39:39.904 --> 01:39:55.796]  But overall, I mean, it's not less or two evils, it's a total different ballgame of what Hillary would have been doing right now, and all the evil stuff she wanted to carry out, and the fact that he is like, there's no mission here, and we're spending 30-40 billion in Syria and 50-something billion here?
[01:39:55.796 --> 01:39:57.117]  That's 100 billion, bring it back!
[01:39:58.178 --> 01:39:58.658]  I don't know.
[01:40:16.331 --> 01:40:18.332]  I don't care if these companies make a lot of money.
[01:40:18.332 --> 01:40:19.853]  That's what builds up infrastructure.
[01:40:19.853 --> 01:40:36.202]  But don't do it at the expense of the damn country and we lose the whole nation when the country's collapsing and there's a whole raft of socialist candidates about to take over and we can't even take care of people at the VA so they don't commit suicide?
[01:40:36.202 --> 01:40:39.183]  And the president can't even say it's okay to love your nation?
[01:40:39.183 --> 01:40:42.045]  They call that evil and say the word nation is evil?
[01:40:42.927 --> 01:40:45.771]  And father and mother and family is evil?
[01:40:45.771 --> 01:40:47.933]  These people are the enemy!
[01:40:47.933 --> 01:40:51.397]  Gosh!
[01:40:51.397 --> 01:40:55.302]  I mean, it's so clear.
[01:40:55.302 --> 01:40:55.903]  It's our fault.
[01:40:55.903 --> 01:40:58.186]  We've let a bunch of crazy criminals run things.
[01:40:58.186 --> 01:41:01.309]  And now they think it's crazy we even exist anymore.
[01:41:01.309 --> 01:41:02.110]  We're so tolerant.
[01:41:03.103 --> 01:41:10.890]  We let these lunatics do whatever they want, and now we're sitting here, and they're telling us that, well, hey, you're normal, and you have a good life, and you're upright.
[01:41:10.890 --> 01:41:12.071]  We're jealous of that!
[01:41:12.071 --> 01:41:13.512]  We want your kids!
[01:41:13.512 --> 01:41:15.014]  Well, guess what, scumbag?
[01:41:15.014 --> 01:41:17.476]  You're not getting them!
[01:41:17.476 --> 01:41:18.016]  We're going to go to break.
[01:41:18.016 --> 01:41:19.678]  I'm going to come right back.
[01:41:19.678 --> 01:41:23.982]  We had huge sales, the biggest sales ever, during Christmas.
[01:41:23.982 --> 01:41:24.402]  And they were.
[01:41:24.402 --> 01:41:29.387]  It was a total blowout sale, and it was very successful, except it didn't really fund us, because a lot of stuff was being sold at cost.
[01:41:30.285 --> 01:41:39.617]  We have some other big, huge, now targeted sales of best-selling products, and these are products you need that are awesome.
[01:41:39.617 --> 01:41:42.661]  We have BrainForce, our total bestseller.
[01:41:42.661 --> 01:41:47.347]  It doesn't make the most money because it's so low-priced, but it's a great neutral pick for the brain.
[01:41:47.347 --> 01:41:48.748]  Amazing focus, clean energy.
[01:41:49.798 --> 01:41:51.579]  It's not replaced by turbo force.
[01:41:51.579 --> 01:41:57.462]  It's augmented, but I will tell you, turbo force will kick you into the next level in an insane way.
[01:41:57.462 --> 01:42:03.105]  I say you take half a packet the first time, because it's mainly a total body energy.
[01:42:03.105 --> 01:42:06.466]  It's the next level energy drink, pre-workout, whatever you want to call it.
[01:42:06.466 --> 01:42:08.567]  It is unbelievable.
[01:42:08.567 --> 01:42:09.848]  It's wide spectrum.
[01:42:09.848 --> 01:42:11.929]  The average person has 10 hours of energy.
[01:42:11.929 --> 01:42:13.450]  Nobody else can say that.
[01:42:13.450 --> 01:42:15.011]  It's redonkulous.
[01:42:16.084 --> 01:42:18.005]  It's just crazy.
[01:42:18.005 --> 01:42:25.170]  We have it 50% off with RainForce because I want you to see how great it is at InfoWarsLife.com or AAA253-3139.

[01:42:48.341 --> 01:42:51.383]  Infowarsstore.com.

[01:42:52.963 --> 01:42:54.624]  Plus, these are amazing products.
[01:42:54.624 --> 01:42:55.865]  There's some other big specials as well.
[01:42:55.865 --> 01:42:56.225]  Check them out.
[01:43:06.553 --> 01:43:15.576]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:43:15.576 --> 01:43:25.638]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:43:25.638 --> 01:43:34.161]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:43:35.001 --> 01:43:36.362]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:43:36.362 --> 01:43:37.523]  You must experience it.
[01:43:37.523 --> 01:43:39.465]  It is a total game changer.
[01:43:39.465 --> 01:43:44.530]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:43:44.530 --> 01:43:46.051]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:43:46.051 --> 01:43:47.512]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:43:47.512 --> 01:43:54.218]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:43:54.218 --> 01:43:57.401]  TurboForce at m4slife.com.
[01:43:57.401 --> 01:44:01.565]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship.
[01:44:02.276 --> 01:44:10.780]  And I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:44:10.780 --> 01:44:23.147]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[01:44:23.147 --> 01:44:25.068]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:44:25.068 --> 01:44:27.749]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:44:29.121 --> 01:44:33.442]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[01:44:33.442 --> 01:44:37.683]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[01:44:37.683 --> 01:44:39.983]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:44:39.983 --> 01:44:42.283]  This country is in a war!
[01:44:42.283 --> 01:44:52.985]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:44:52.985 --> 01:44:56.566]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[01:44:58.308 --> 01:45:04.533]  Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[01:45:04.533 --> 01:45:10.457]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[01:45:10.457 --> 01:45:12.058]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[01:45:12.058 --> 01:45:12.559]  We stopped her.
[01:45:12.559 --> 01:45:14.740]  We got a Nationalist in.
[01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:16.942]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[01:45:16.942 --> 01:45:17.863]  We are winning.
[01:45:18.837 --> 01:45:24.203]  Those of us who are at the very front line of the tip of the spear are under unprecedented attack.
[01:45:24.203 --> 01:45:29.309]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of a treasure.
[01:45:29.309 --> 01:45:30.410]  This is about who wants it most.
[01:45:31.869 --> 01:45:35.390]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors they've taken, everything.
[01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:37.531]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:40.732]  I need financial support and I got products you and your family need.
[01:45:40.732 --> 01:45:41.852]  It's that simple.
[01:45:41.852 --> 01:45:49.395]  Thousands of great products, whatever's award-winning, whatever's best-selling, what folks love, what I love, we bring it to you at InfoWareShore.com.
[01:45:49.395 --> 01:45:57.518]  So please, go to InfoWareShore.com today, look at all the great products, because we're in your hands, I'm in your hands, and your support is beyond critical.
[01:45:57.518 --> 01:45:57.818]  Thank you.
[01:45:58.211 --> 01:46:02.334]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:46:02.334 --> 01:46:09.418]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[01:46:09.418 --> 01:46:14.221]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[01:46:14.221 --> 01:46:21.105]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced four-stage compact filtration system
[01:46:21.545 --> 01:46:27.547]  that will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[01:46:27.547 --> 01:46:37.111]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[01:46:37.111 --> 01:46:44.234]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[01:46:44.594 --> 01:46:46.794]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:14.238 --> 01:47:22.666]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:48.473]  Well, Maxine Waters, we played the clip earlier, we'll play it again in a few minutes, is in total panic mode.
[01:47:48.473 --> 01:47:50.734]  She says, do not watch the State of the Union.
[01:47:50.734 --> 01:47:55.156]  It's like they didn't want Trump to be able to even have, there's a lot of things, shut it down, don't carry it.
[01:47:55.156 --> 01:47:58.137]  They want everyone censored.
[01:47:58.137 --> 01:47:59.778]  But they're really going to panic over this.
[01:47:59.778 --> 01:48:04.620]  Even though the polls are fake and skewed for the Democrats, Trump's approval rating higher than Obama.
[01:48:05.808 --> 01:48:10.931]  At same point in the presidency when he gave his third State of the Union.
[01:48:10.931 --> 01:48:16.715]  Also, up on InfoWars.com by the great Jamie White, very important article that you get and get out to everybody.
[01:48:16.715 --> 01:48:20.818]  Terrified liberals urge boycott of President Trump's State of the Union address.
[01:48:20.818 --> 01:48:28.263]  How about you go get this article and send it out and say, you know what, the censorship's gotten so bad, now they're saying don't watch the State of the Union.
[01:48:28.263 --> 01:48:30.144]  Don't hear what this guy has to say.
[01:48:30.144 --> 01:48:33.986]  We want to misrepresent it.
[01:48:33.986 --> 01:48:35.007]  It's truly incredible.
[01:48:36.488 --> 01:49:00.186]  And now, the Office of the Inspector General has not released the name of the FBI agents, but they're recommending criminal indictments for misconduct of FBI Supervisory Special Agent, for making false representations, working for an FBI contractor according to gifts from an FBI applicant, receiving them, accepting the FBI applicant in an employment selection process, and misusing a government vehicle and cell phone.
[01:49:00.186 --> 01:49:02.528]  So a lot of shoes are about to drop.
[01:49:03.468 --> 01:49:05.672]  On that front, the battle is joined.
[01:49:05.672 --> 01:49:17.530]  Now joining us, speaking of joining, is Gab McGinnis, who just filed suit against the very mysterious, globalist, multi-billion dollar consortium of the Southern Property Law Center that started out
[01:49:19.121 --> 01:49:19.801]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:49:47.873 --> 01:49:50.763]  Well, wow, show.
[01:49:50.763 --> 01:49:51.385]  Break this down.
[01:49:51.385 --> 01:49:52.570]  How'd the press conference go?
[01:49:52.570 --> 01:49:53.613]  What's the response?
[01:49:53.613 --> 01:49:53.954]  Deadline.
[01:49:55.444 --> 01:49:56.384]  The response is great.
[01:49:56.384 --> 01:50:01.927]  We've already raised about $35,000, I think, on DefendGavin.com.
[01:50:01.927 --> 01:50:03.947]  We'll need to raise a lot more, of course.
[01:50:03.947 --> 01:50:09.169]  It's going to be a hell of a battle because we're going up against people that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:16.192]  I mean, even that payout they did to Majid Nawaz of $3.7 million, that was just a parking ticket to them.
[01:50:16.192 --> 01:50:18.333]  We are up against a major force right now.
[01:50:20.362 --> 01:50:30.902]  Let's break down, like you do in your press release, who these people really are, what their plan is, because they're seen as God by the banks, the media, and when they say you're a bad person, you go right to the ovens.
[01:50:32.247 --> 01:50:33.848]  This is more than just a hate list.
[01:50:33.848 --> 01:50:37.250]  It's not just a random list that you appear on and it doesn't matter.
[01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:41.533]  And it doesn't just affect your Twitter account or stop you from putting a picture on Instagram.
[01:50:41.533 --> 01:50:51.138]  They are deeply embedded in all social media and they are getting involved in banking and affecting what companies can bank with whom.
[01:50:51.138 --> 01:51:00.084]  I mean, it's sort of like the Al Sharpton racket where they say, you better use us as your policy guide, as your ethics commissioner.
[01:51:00.784 --> 01:51:05.066]  Or we're going to blackball you and make you seem evil and put you on our hate list.
[01:51:05.066 --> 01:51:08.107]  So it's a form of extortion at this point.
[01:51:08.107 --> 01:51:17.832]  And they've got this new thing called Change the Terms, where they want to get deeply involved in all social media, which is really getting involved in the way us Americans talk to each other.
[01:51:17.832 --> 01:51:20.553]  They want to prevent us from talking to each other.
[01:51:21.249 --> 01:51:32.860]  It's really insidious, it's really Orwellian, and it's mostly directed at Christians and Conservatives, but I'm telling you, the Left knows how to cannibalize itself, and it's going to start affecting everyone on all sides of the spectrum.
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:43.690]  This isn't just going to be, I'm against bigots, this is going to be, whoever the SPLC dislikes is depersoned across all platforms, and unable to do business.
[01:51:43.690 --> 01:51:44.211]  Bankrupted.
[01:51:44.787 --> 01:52:02.035]  Well, let me raise this, because Joe Rogan's been getting 40,000 to 5,000 dislikes since it came out that he's on the payroll of Jack Dorsey on Twitter for product placement, not telling people and promoting Bitcoin and other securities without telling people that he's being paid, which is illegal.
[01:52:02.435 --> 01:52:04.677]  A lot of folks get paid major fines and jail time for that.
[01:52:04.677 --> 01:52:07.260]  I'm just pointing out that he must be holier than thou.
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:08.861]  We're going to expose it.
[01:52:08.861 --> 01:52:09.882]  But don't worry.
[01:52:09.882 --> 01:52:16.949]  Google, a parent company of YouTube, says we're looking to get rid of the thumbs up, thumbs down because that's a hate.
[01:52:17.889 --> 01:52:24.475]  Being able to vote, being able to show if you like something or not, which the whole system is based on, that group voting, well that's evil.
[01:52:24.475 --> 01:52:26.416]  Democrats love voting, it's an illegal alien.
[01:52:26.416 --> 01:52:27.497]  They don't want you voting.
[01:52:27.497 --> 01:52:30.239]  Haters can't hate if there's no dislike button.
[01:52:30.239 --> 01:52:33.902]  Users slam YouTube for a mulling thumbs down fix.
[01:52:33.902 --> 01:52:35.584]  That was yesterday.
[01:52:35.584 --> 01:52:40.768]  They're officially saying today that they are planning to get rid of it.
[01:52:40.768 --> 01:52:42.269]  I mean, that's just next level.
[01:52:43.809 --> 01:52:47.276]  You know, this is all just a war on color and a war on fun, a war on you.
[01:52:48.381 --> 01:52:51.603]  Alex is a war on people who are hyperbolic.
[01:52:51.603 --> 01:52:54.004]  And thumbs down, thumbs up, that's how we express ourselves.
[01:52:54.004 --> 01:52:59.286]  You know that non-playable character meme and the learn to code meme?
[01:52:59.286 --> 01:53:02.848]  They're going to start calling those hate speech and they'll outlaw those.
[01:53:02.848 --> 01:53:08.090]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, they banned a whole bunch of people saying learn to code is white supremacist.
[01:53:08.090 --> 01:53:09.731]  So that's actually banned now.
[01:53:09.731 --> 01:53:11.832]  A leftist can say I'm going to kill you and all that.
[01:53:11.832 --> 01:53:14.613]  But if you say, hey, learn to code, well, you're off Twitter.
[01:53:15.757 --> 01:53:17.078]  It's a war on jokes!
[01:53:17.078 --> 01:53:20.261]  Remember Orwell said, within every joke is a tiny revolution?
[01:53:20.261 --> 01:53:29.110]  And these people are extinguishing jokes, extinguishing color, extinguishing fun, and it's under the guise of egalitarianism, but that's a lie.
[01:53:29.110 --> 01:53:35.356]  The SPLC ran out of actual bigots a long time ago, and now they just generate them out of thin air.
[01:53:35.356 --> 01:53:39.880]  And in that sense, they're the real hate group, because they are generating hate where there is none.
[01:53:42.267 --> 01:53:46.768]  Think about Google came out last week and said, we're looking at how to control the word family.
[01:53:46.768 --> 01:53:47.789]  It's hurtful.
[01:53:47.789 --> 01:53:52.170]  So now family, I mean, you talk about a cult and you talk about getting rid of color.
[01:53:52.170 --> 01:53:52.450]  It's about 1984.
[01:53:52.450 --> 01:53:54.810]  Everybody wears gray outfits.
[01:53:54.810 --> 01:53:57.771]  The houses are ugly to dehumanize or trying to end the family.
[01:53:57.771 --> 01:53:59.392]  They haven't figured out how to do it.
[01:53:59.392 --> 01:54:04.133]  He was a top Fabian socialist who was on board till he found out how bad the socialists were.
[01:54:04.133 --> 01:54:07.214]  And 1984 is about how bad fascists and socialists are.
[01:54:07.814 --> 01:54:10.995]  And so, yeah, they're getting rid of the real diversity.
[01:54:10.995 --> 01:54:15.196]  They're getting rid of what really makes us great.
[01:54:15.196 --> 01:54:17.496]  And it's what makes America unique.
[01:54:17.496 --> 01:54:19.697]  I mean, free speech isn't a big thing in Canada.
[01:54:19.697 --> 01:54:24.318]  In fact, the Canadian Human Rights Commission proudly touts that they are not about free speech.
[01:54:24.318 --> 01:54:25.458]  That's an American thing.
[01:54:25.458 --> 01:54:32.140]  Britain, one of the reasons why Jeet Nawaz was able to sue the SPLC is because Britain doesn't really have free speech laws.
[01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:33.440]  It's easy to sue over there.
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:38.481]  Um, when you decided someone has offended you.
[01:54:38.481 --> 01:54:42.222]  And the beauty of America is we are the ugly Americans.
[01:54:42.222 --> 01:54:44.002]  It's Rodney Dangerfield and Caddyshack.
[01:54:44.002 --> 01:54:45.183]  We're crass.
[01:54:45.183 --> 01:54:46.923]  We like to make inappropriate jokes.
[01:54:46.923 --> 01:54:49.404]  You know, this is the home of Beavis and Butt-head.
[01:54:49.404 --> 01:54:55.125]  And they're taking that all away and they're just, they're draining America of the red, white, and blue and just making it grey.
[01:54:57.921 --> 01:55:07.007]  I forgot to send this to the producers a few days ago when I saw it, but a famous British author, Chris Hitchens, little best buddy, he does this video.
[01:55:07.007 --> 01:55:10.349]  It's time to talk about Alex Jones and white supremism.
[01:55:10.349 --> 01:55:14.151]  And then he says, Jones says, kill the Parkland parents.
[01:55:14.151 --> 01:55:17.153]  Jones says, kill children at Parkland.
[01:55:17.153 --> 01:55:17.893]  I never said that.
[01:55:17.893 --> 01:55:19.994]  He says, Jones said no one died at Parkland.
[01:55:19.994 --> 01:55:25.738]  So now they've just moved on from Sandy Hook and are just making up the most insane crap I've ever seen in my life.
[01:55:27.344 --> 01:55:27.684]  I think so.
[01:55:47.546 --> 01:55:49.807]  Journalism doesn't involve research anymore.
[01:55:49.807 --> 01:55:52.568]  Journalism is all just opinion pieces now.
[01:55:52.568 --> 01:55:54.288]  And they're really bad writers, too.
[01:55:54.288 --> 01:55:55.388]  That's the worst part.
[01:55:55.388 --> 01:56:00.330]  You're reading fiction by incompetent writers.
[01:56:00.330 --> 01:56:04.291]  What's the next shoe to drop?
[01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:04.811]  What do you mean?
[01:56:04.811 --> 01:56:06.572]  For me, or in general in society?
[01:56:06.974 --> 01:56:14.537]  Well, no, just at every level, because I asked you like two years ago, when will we hit peak liberal insanity and outrage?
[01:56:14.537 --> 01:56:15.898]  You said, oh, it's going to get much worse.
[01:56:15.898 --> 01:56:17.358]  And so what's next for you?
[01:56:17.358 --> 01:56:18.659]  What's next for their moral outrage?
[01:56:20.290 --> 01:56:27.036]  I think what's next with the far left, the SPLC, is total domination of all communication platforms.
[01:56:27.036 --> 01:56:30.659]  So conservatives, Christians and conservatives, have no voice.
[01:56:30.659 --> 01:56:39.886]  And it will just be this infinite loop bubble of people making up stories about Trump and about conservatives and about guys like you and me, and we won't be able to defend ourselves.
[01:56:39.886 --> 01:56:44.050]  And they'll go off on a tangent until we are inhuman.
[01:56:44.050 --> 01:56:45.331]  We're easy to kill.
[01:56:45.331 --> 01:56:49.334]  You've had so many lies about this person being a Nazi that it seems ethical to kill him.
[01:56:50.086 --> 01:56:51.667]  And that's where I think we're headed to.
[01:56:51.667 --> 01:56:56.070]  We're headed to intense violence towards Christians and conservatives.
[01:56:56.070 --> 01:56:57.111]  Well, that's it.
[01:56:57.111 --> 01:57:00.874]  And just the insanity of these people and their arrogance.
[01:57:00.874 --> 01:57:04.597]  And a lot of it is big free societies create a lot of bums and a lot of stupid people.
[01:57:05.282 --> 01:57:05.782]  I think you're right.
[01:57:05.782 --> 01:57:08.205]  I'm getting another call from another news source.
[01:57:08.205 --> 01:57:09.285]  I'm doing interviews all day.
[01:57:29.358 --> 01:57:29.559]  I know.
[01:57:29.559 --> 01:57:31.141]  I'm sad we got you on 45 minutes late.
[01:57:31.141 --> 01:57:32.624]  I hope you get your computer fixed.
[01:57:32.624 --> 01:57:34.567]  Gavin McGinnis, have fun, buddy.
[01:57:34.567 --> 01:57:35.389]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:57:35.389 --> 01:57:37.793]  Good job following that suit and taking action.
[01:57:37.793 --> 01:57:38.274]  All right.
[01:57:38.274 --> 01:57:40.758]  We'll be right back on the other side with a ton of news.
[01:57:40.758 --> 01:57:42.361]  Hour 3, straight ahead.

[01:58:56.695 --> 01:59:00.739]  Because everybody else, they put in a little bit of product and then they do a bunch of advertising and promote it.
[01:59:00.739 --> 01:59:01.941]  The turmeric in this is 95% curcuminoid.
[01:59:03.943 --> 01:59:06.665]  Nobody else has that bright yellow school bus color.
[01:59:06.665 --> 01:59:07.605]  That's what you're looking for.

[01:59:46.931 --> 01:59:51.735]  You need to try TurboForce today.
[01:59:51.735 --> 01:59:54.377]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.467 --> 02:00:16.990]  Scannin' the scene of the city tonight.
[02:00:16.990 --> 02:00:19.812]  Lookin' for you to start up a fight.
[02:00:19.812 --> 02:00:23.054]  There's only one thing on our minds.
[02:00:23.054 --> 02:00:26.236]  So stop runnin' away, cause you're the one we'll find.
[02:00:26.236 --> 02:00:29.358]  Turn it up.
[02:00:29.358 --> 02:00:32.841]  Alright!
[02:00:32.841 --> 02:00:34.802]  You globalists think you're comin' for me?
[02:00:34.802 --> 02:00:35.683]  I'm comin' for you.
[02:00:35.683 --> 02:00:40.846]  I've been scannin' the scene of the city tonight.
[02:00:40.846 --> 02:00:42.808]  Lookin' for you to start up a fight.
[02:00:45.714 --> 02:00:46.655]  Kill them all!
[02:00:46.655 --> 02:01:10.514]  Let God sort them out.
[02:01:10.514 --> 02:01:13.136]  Looking for you, startup of life.
[02:01:15.455 --> 02:01:39.161]  All right, as we seek and destroy pedophiles and globalists tonight, remember the mission Seek and... Seek and Destroy!
[02:01:44.522 --> 02:01:54.184]  Search and Destroy!
[02:01:54.184 --> 02:01:54.764]  Search and clear.
[02:01:54.764 --> 02:01:58.605]  Okay folks, let's get serious here.
[02:01:58.605 --> 02:02:05.926]  It's a good Hatfield laugh at the end of this song.
[02:02:05.926 --> 02:02:12.028]  Alright, here's what's gonna happen.
[02:02:12.028 --> 02:02:13.148]  I realize more and more
[02:02:15.823 --> 02:02:17.344]  Oh, there's no escape, that's for sure.
[02:02:17.344 --> 02:02:29.111]  You hear that, Joe Rogan?
[02:02:29.111 --> 02:02:30.992]  You've always been taken.
[02:02:30.992 --> 02:02:33.374]  Now you're about to be given.
[02:02:33.374 --> 02:02:35.335]  Oh my God, the video Joe Rogan put out.
[02:02:35.335 --> 02:02:36.695]  I couldn't even watch all of it.
[02:02:36.695 --> 02:02:38.737]  We're gonna play it coming up.
[02:02:38.737 --> 02:02:40.398]  Together.
[02:02:40.398 --> 02:02:43.299]  Like, he talks to people like they're children.
[02:02:43.299 --> 02:02:44.040]  I call his prey.
[02:02:45.262 --> 02:02:49.184]  Like he talks to me like I'm one of his prey.
[02:02:49.184 --> 02:02:53.367]  And like, oh, if I saw you here, you're still my friend.
[02:02:53.367 --> 02:02:56.028]  Just stop what you're doing, Alex.
[02:02:56.028 --> 02:03:05.154]  And all the rest of this crap, this is gold-plated BS when we play it.
[02:03:05.154 --> 02:03:11.638]  But I've got another little fop, another little turd basket that we need to get to first.
[02:03:12.731 --> 02:03:18.434]  And that's Martin Ames when we return.
[02:03:18.434 --> 02:03:35.424]  Because I saw this a couple days ago, and literally, 99% of the comments, I think there's more comments than views, are, you are the biggest fake moron, pickle-brained idiot we've ever heard in our life.
[02:03:35.424 --> 02:03:37.846]  But you've got to understand, with these guys, that's all they do.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:51.667]  It's just walk around and blovate and just like pause on their own sentences and go, English accent!
[02:03:51.667 --> 02:03:53.709]  Look at that!
[02:03:53.709 --> 02:03:54.449]  That nose!
[02:03:54.449 --> 02:03:59.832]  You can stick a tap in that, pure whiskey would come right out of it.
[02:03:59.832 --> 02:04:05.156]  So anyways, this is hilarious because you need to get in the mindset of these guys.
[02:04:06.474 --> 02:04:09.175]  And you've got to understand what you're dealing with.
[02:04:09.175 --> 02:04:11.376]  So we're going to be talking about that when we come up.
[02:04:11.376 --> 02:04:19.839]  But Joe Rogan literally does all these Soros talking points from Soros organizations.
[02:04:19.839 --> 02:04:26.601]  He cites Soros organizations and then says, I'm a liar.
[02:04:26.601 --> 02:04:28.542]  No, I'm not a liar.
[02:04:28.542 --> 02:04:32.563]  So you can run, run, run.
[02:04:32.563 --> 02:04:33.604]  You can run, run, run.
[02:04:34.682 --> 02:04:40.245]  But you can't get away for your date with Destiny Jojo.
[02:04:40.245 --> 02:04:45.327]  Joe Rogan, metaphysically, is a Christmas hog.
[02:04:45.327 --> 02:04:49.669]  And I'm gonna politically haul him up by his back legs and slit his throat.
[02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:53.531]  His blood will fill buckets, politically, non-violently.
[02:04:53.531 --> 02:04:54.191]  Get ready, Joe.
[02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:07.901]  By leaps and by bounds.
[02:05:07.901 --> 02:05:14.583]  The number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:05:14.583 --> 02:05:24.665]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:05:24.665 --> 02:05:33.188]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:05:34.028 --> 02:05:35.369]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:05:35.369 --> 02:05:36.530]  You must experience it.
[02:05:36.530 --> 02:05:38.471]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:05:38.471 --> 02:05:43.534]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:05:43.534 --> 02:05:45.055]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:05:45.055 --> 02:05:46.536]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:05:46.536 --> 02:05:53.221]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:05:53.221 --> 02:05:54.722]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[02:06:26.232 --> 02:06:31.113]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:06:31.113 --> 02:06:33.413]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:33.413 --> 02:06:40.515]  I already told you globalists and all you minions of the system a long time ago.
[02:06:40.515 --> 02:06:43.416]  I'm afraid of God.
[02:06:43.416 --> 02:06:46.156]  When I'm not fighting you, I feel scared.
[02:06:46.156 --> 02:06:50.077]  When I fight you, I see God smiling in the center of my soul.
[02:06:50.077 --> 02:06:51.637]  Right in my heart.
[02:06:51.637 --> 02:06:55.178]  I know the wind is filling my sails and I'm on a journey.
[02:06:56.823 --> 02:06:57.524]  I'm supposed to go.
[02:06:57.524 --> 02:07:01.127]  I'm on the path of my ancestors.
[02:07:01.127 --> 02:07:03.369]  A path beyond the stars.
[02:07:03.369 --> 02:07:05.952]  A path to Valhalla.
[02:07:05.952 --> 02:07:08.214]  And that's why I do this.
[02:07:08.214 --> 02:07:09.895]  Because to not do it is to lose the soul.
[02:07:09.895 --> 02:07:15.781]  And you've all chosen your lot with the devil.
[02:07:15.781 --> 02:07:18.483]  And I've chosen that I must take you on.
[02:07:20.382 --> 02:07:23.424]  It'll be this contest that defines us.
[02:07:23.424 --> 02:07:29.368]  It'll be these wars, these fights, that make us who we are.
[02:07:29.368 --> 02:07:34.732]  Once we stop fearing the devil, and start taking the devil on, is the day we start living.
[02:07:34.732 --> 02:07:39.195]  And then you see the horizon.
[02:07:39.195 --> 02:07:40.796]  You realize God's in control.
[02:07:40.796 --> 02:07:45.079]  And the bluff's gotta be called.
[02:07:45.079 --> 02:07:46.600]  The enemy's gotta be engaged.
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:49.162]  Bone's gotta meet bone.
[02:07:50.276 --> 02:07:52.500]  Sword's gotta meet shield.
[02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:54.342]  The axe has gotta come down on that skull.
[02:07:54.342 --> 02:08:02.995]  And in the end, we'll see heaven.
[02:08:02.995 --> 02:08:04.698]  You know, one of my greatest frustrations
[02:08:05.954 --> 02:08:09.117]  Is that the enemies of freedom are so pathetic.
[02:08:09.117 --> 02:08:16.303]  You know, it's in Revelation that after, for a thousand years, the devil will be bound and basically be an amusement.
[02:08:16.303 --> 02:08:22.468]  And people are gonna walk by and see the Antichrist, see the devil, and say, that's what did all this?
[02:08:22.468 --> 02:08:26.372]  That this was able to do it?
[02:08:26.372 --> 02:08:31.276]  But see, don't joke too long, because God's gonna let him out again.
[02:08:34.133 --> 02:08:54.067]  After a thousand years of life extension and nobody dying and the secrets of the dimensions and everything on this planet, unlimited potential, a jump point to the universe, people will turn against God again when they've already seen it and know everything.
[02:08:54.067 --> 02:09:00.232]  But after that, this whole reality that God created as a simulation will be rolled up like a scroll.
[02:09:04.534 --> 02:09:08.557]  And everyone that was part of the enemy plan is gone.
[02:09:08.557 --> 02:09:09.578]  And we go to the next level.
[02:09:09.578 --> 02:09:18.505]  I don't know about you, but I want to be, I want to be on the next level, right?
[02:09:18.505 --> 02:09:20.147]  Let me explain something to you.
[02:09:20.147 --> 02:09:21.408]  This isn't my cosmology.
[02:09:21.408 --> 02:09:23.109]  This isn't something out of a book.
[02:09:23.109 --> 02:09:29.854]  This is studying the enemy and who they are and who they serve and the darkness they're involved in.
[02:09:29.854 --> 02:09:32.997]  These are collaborators with the worst crap in the universe.
[02:09:35.896 --> 02:09:39.899]  You see, God's free will.
[02:09:39.899 --> 02:09:42.261]  These individuals are against free will.
[02:09:42.261 --> 02:09:46.545]  So let me shift gears to this guy.
[02:09:46.545 --> 02:09:51.729]  Couple days ago, somebody emailed me the video and they said, look at this guy.
[02:09:51.729 --> 02:09:56.513]  I mean, is this guy reporting from another dimension?
[02:09:56.513 --> 02:09:58.615]  Is this guy reporting from another reality?
[02:09:58.615 --> 02:10:02.979]  And it was an image for the video of myself
[02:10:04.861 --> 02:10:07.543]  And a burning swastika.
[02:10:07.543 --> 02:10:11.427]  Maybe we can pull the YouTube up for folks.
[02:10:11.427 --> 02:10:15.230]  And what to do with evil ideas.
[02:10:15.230 --> 02:10:26.359]  So he goes on to misrepresent what I've said and done, compares me to the Nazis, Martin Amos, and says, I need to be taken off the year.
[02:10:26.359 --> 02:10:27.320]  Is basically the video.
[02:10:29.551 --> 02:10:47.470]  And you talk about someone in love with themselves, the way he talks real slow and then kind of... And he says the most insane stuff like, if the media hadn't been so even-handed and balanced, we'd have President Clinton in charge.
[02:10:48.427 --> 02:10:54.069]  What, like giving her all the questions and rigging the polls and 93% negative?
[02:10:54.069 --> 02:10:56.770]  If the media hadn't been so fair?
[02:10:56.770 --> 02:11:01.151]  And then he says something that he is in the poll position.
[02:11:01.151 --> 02:11:03.512]  Now in the next few months, I've already filed some suits.
[02:11:03.512 --> 02:11:10.995]  I'm filing suits against people that say that I've harassed the Sandy Hook families or say that I'm currently saying it didn't happen, which is out of context.
[02:11:10.995 --> 02:11:12.275]  But he goes further.
[02:11:12.275 --> 02:11:13.416]  He says that I say
[02:11:14.764 --> 02:11:19.406]  No one died at Parkland, and they're all crisis actors, though I never said that.
[02:11:19.406 --> 02:11:22.027]  I said there was a police stand-down first.
[02:11:22.027 --> 02:11:24.068]  YouTube took my videos down and said that.
[02:11:24.068 --> 02:11:26.829]  We had copies ourselves, put them up.
[02:11:26.829 --> 02:11:32.952]  DrudgeLink to it had 14 million views on two videos, and YouTube had to say, okay, it's true, you didn't say that, and put it back up.
[02:11:32.952 --> 02:11:34.633]  But even if I had said that, it's free speech.
[02:11:34.633 --> 02:11:42.516]  I want to say the moon's been out of cheese, but no, the shooting happened, and there was a police stand-down, as usual.
[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:53.105]  And he says, not only is he saying Parkland didn't happen, he's trying to kill the parents, he's saying murder them!
[02:11:53.105 --> 02:12:01.130]  Now you talk about fire in a theatre, that's not free speech if I'm saying murder people.
[02:12:01.130 --> 02:12:03.231]  Of course I didn't say that, he doesn't show it.
[02:12:03.231 --> 02:12:07.254]  So he sits there with his big giant alcoholic Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer nose,
[02:12:09.258 --> 02:12:28.952]  And he looks like someone you'd find at a mental institution, and it goes back to Christopher Hitchens and him, and all these pseudo-intellectuals, because they walk around going, oh, yes, and wearing gloves and cigarettes with long filters, and going, oh, yes, God doesn't exist, piss on him, I'm so smart.
[02:12:28.952 --> 02:12:35.597]  He goes, listen, some ideas are so evil, you just don't allow them.
[02:12:35.597 --> 02:12:36.818]  I mean, this is what we're fighting.
[02:12:37.881 --> 02:12:40.863]  These people are jokes!
[02:12:40.863 --> 02:12:55.273]  I mean, I could sit here and speak about how you're completely festooned with that entire flotilla of clichés and anti-free speech potpourri, but I don't... Oh, let me do this.
[02:12:55.273 --> 02:12:55.914]  Hold on.
[02:12:55.914 --> 02:12:58.376]  I'm putting my finger to my face.
[02:12:58.376 --> 02:13:03.099]  Do you realize how advanced that is?
[02:13:03.099 --> 02:13:05.421]  So, this is called the Big Think.
[02:13:06.528 --> 02:13:12.859]  And the big thing says you can't hear this information.
[02:13:12.859 --> 02:13:15.403]  This Alex Jones is so horrible.
[02:13:16.178 --> 02:13:23.325]  We need him removed so cowards like this man, Martin Amos, can lie about them.
[02:13:23.325 --> 02:13:28.170]  What he's saying is, oh dear, the litmus test to get some attention.
[02:13:28.170 --> 02:13:36.999]  No one's paying attention to me under my rock, under my alcoholic rock, wrapped around a vodka or scotch bottle.
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:44.583]  I'll make myself popular with the young ones and I'll come out and attack Alex Jones.
[02:13:44.583 --> 02:13:49.785]  Joe Rogan did it and he's lost a million subscribers and gets 90% downvotes.
[02:13:49.785 --> 02:13:51.386]  Let me try it.
[02:13:51.386 --> 02:13:52.986]  I'll show them.
[02:13:52.986 --> 02:13:55.687]  In fact, enough from me.
[02:13:55.687 --> 02:13:58.349]  Let's hear a real mind.
[02:13:58.349 --> 02:14:01.630]  Here he is.
[02:14:01.630 --> 02:14:03.150]  What to do with evil ideas?
[02:14:03.150 --> 02:14:06.312]  Salman Rushdie has argued that
[02:14:07.592 --> 02:14:16.772]  That you can't be, you know, it's idiotic to say you're above politics because politics is all around you and above you and beneath you.
[02:14:18.879 --> 02:14:25.105]  I was resistant to that idea, but it's clearly true, isn't it?
[02:14:25.105 --> 02:14:27.768]  It's clearly true, isn't it?
[02:14:27.768 --> 02:14:29.169]  That there shouldn't be free speech.
[02:14:29.169 --> 02:14:39.058]  I mean, I do like one thing a year, and just drink alcohol and piss blood all day, and I... I'm threatened by... Sorry, go ahead.
[02:14:40.099 --> 02:14:50.523]  But it's clearly true, isn't it, that it's very hard to imagine a piece of writing or a longish... Hold on, hold on.
[02:14:50.523 --> 02:14:53.004]  Let's start over after the break.
[02:14:53.004 --> 02:15:01.166]  I just love the... That supposedly impresses all the pseudo-intellectuals and fops of, you know, inbred, wannabe British royalty at these events.
[02:15:01.166 --> 02:15:02.847]  You can type his name in with Christopher Hitchens.
[02:15:02.847 --> 02:15:05.568]  It's like, them with cigarettes and martinis.
[02:15:06.128 --> 02:15:07.749]  Oh, God, this is smart!
[02:15:07.749 --> 02:15:08.689]  Oh, Lord!
[02:15:08.689 --> 02:15:09.950]  Oh, oh, oh!
[02:15:09.950 --> 02:15:17.773]  And they just walk around going, oh, it's so incredibly... You read some of their writings, it's like a... monkey wrote it or something.
[02:15:17.773 --> 02:15:21.175]  It's so chillingly powerful.
[02:15:21.175 --> 02:15:23.456]  These are fake right-wingers embraced by the left.
[02:15:24.158 --> 02:15:25.599]  Which, what does that tell you?
[02:15:25.599 --> 02:15:29.160]  Nihilist, you know, just jokes.
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:38.023]  Walking around, I just went, if I do this with my lips, it's just ridiculous.
[02:15:38.023 --> 02:15:41.805]  I didn't used to agree to the end of free speech, but now I do.
[02:15:41.805 --> 02:15:50.248]  The good news is, you incredible brain, 99% of the comments are just like, my God.
[02:15:51.149 --> 02:15:54.184]  This man's brain is Swiss cheese.
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:56.741]  Maybe not today.
[02:15:56.741 --> 02:15:58.021]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:15:58.021 --> 02:16:01.763]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:01.763 --> 02:16:02.843]  Forget bunkers.

[02:20:47.998 --> 02:20:50.880]  Riding down your freeway.
[02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:56.664]  Driving down your freeway.
[02:20:56.664 --> 02:20:59.265]  Midnight alleys roam.
[02:20:59.265 --> 02:21:02.467]  Cops in cars.
[02:21:02.467 --> 02:21:05.369]  Cops in cars, the timeless bars.
[02:21:05.369 --> 02:21:07.751]  Never saw a woman so alone.
[02:21:09.190 --> 02:21:10.751]  LA is so soulless.
[02:21:10.751 --> 02:21:13.454]  And the city's like a woman.
[02:21:13.454 --> 02:21:14.074]  The planet's a woman.
[02:21:14.074 --> 02:21:15.936]  Everything's a woman.
[02:21:15.936 --> 02:21:18.758]  So alone!
[02:21:18.758 --> 02:21:21.280]  Motel money, murder madness!
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:26.124]  Oh, you can tell on the doors?
[02:21:26.124 --> 02:21:34.751]  You know, I've talked to three directors that knew Jim Morrison before he got out of the film and into music.
[02:21:34.751 --> 02:21:37.353]  And I'm gonna meet with one more of them soon.
[02:21:37.353 --> 02:21:38.154]  To learn the real secret.
[02:21:39.667 --> 02:21:42.329]  Yeah, we're doing some research.
[02:21:42.329 --> 02:21:46.951]  I got my mojo rising.
[02:21:46.951 --> 02:21:51.474]  I'm gonna keep on riding, riding.
[02:21:51.474 --> 02:21:54.196]  Riding, riding.
[02:21:54.196 --> 02:22:01.060]  Woo!
[02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:06.663]  Ah, that'll probably turn the music off.
[02:22:09.454 --> 02:22:29.809]  When you start riding the mojo, man, you look back at the devil.
[02:22:29.809 --> 02:22:31.371]  You're like, man, I'm way better than the devil.
[02:22:31.371 --> 02:22:32.011]  I'm a god.
[02:22:32.011 --> 02:22:33.953]  I'm going with god.
[02:22:33.953 --> 02:22:34.893]  I don't want all this stuff.
[02:22:34.893 --> 02:22:36.394]  I don't want to be Joe Rogan.
[02:22:39.831 --> 02:22:43.574]  All right, let's get serious.
[02:22:43.574 --> 02:22:55.121]  We've got to get this last part tough.
[02:23:16.617 --> 02:23:18.558]  Woo!
[02:23:18.558 --> 02:23:23.160]  All right, let's get serious.
[02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:25.120]  A little bit of fun here with Jim Morrison.
[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:29.042]  Rest in peace.
[02:23:29.042 --> 02:23:29.262]  L.A.
[02:23:29.262 --> 02:23:32.823]  Woman, man, that's probably the best four song.
[02:23:32.823 --> 02:23:39.226]  All right, let's get back to Martin Amish.
[02:23:39.226 --> 02:23:41.727]  Just had fun in a Hollywood bungalow.
[02:23:56.229 --> 02:23:58.511]  Let's go to Las Vegas!
[02:23:58.511 --> 02:23:59.593]  City at night!
[02:23:59.593 --> 02:24:03.557]  City at night!
[02:24:03.557 --> 02:24:04.037]  Woo!
[02:24:04.037 --> 02:24:10.124]  Alright, I'm gonna stop the karaoke right now.
[02:24:11.608 --> 02:24:26.733]  We'll cut out this little part that was live on radio, and we'll go back to Amos, just on the tail end of that, because this, guys, isn't important enough to talk about much more, because I got a Christmas peg to deal with in the next segment, who already feels the Hades fire lapping its way up.
[02:24:26.733 --> 02:24:39.717]  Now, so Martin Amos is this fop, pseudo-intellectual, celebrated man who looks like he has the most alcoholic nose ever seen on planet Earth.
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:58.264]  And so, he gives this impassioned call for censoring me, and then defames the living daylights out of me, saying that I said kill the parents of Parkland students.
[02:24:58.264 --> 02:25:00.885]  Wow, just the lies just get better and better.
[02:25:00.885 --> 02:25:02.725]  And that no one died.
[02:25:02.725 --> 02:25:06.126]  Confronting it with Sandy Hook twisted stuff.
[02:25:06.126 --> 02:25:10.507]  And he just sits there and goes, I touched my cheek, I'm intellectual, I have a purple nose.
[02:25:11.681 --> 02:25:12.903]  I'm big think.
[02:25:12.903 --> 02:25:14.705]  That's big.
[02:25:14.705 --> 02:25:16.948]  Big think is get rid of free speech.
[02:25:16.948 --> 02:25:17.989]  So let's start it over.
[02:25:17.989 --> 02:25:20.031]  I'm not going to comment until the end.
[02:25:20.031 --> 02:25:25.078]  But this, my friends, is the prime subject for the lawsuit.
[02:25:26.109 --> 02:25:28.231]  Because there's thousands of them doing it.
[02:25:28.231 --> 02:25:30.213]  And they say, he's harassing families.
[02:25:30.213 --> 02:25:31.474]  He won't leave them alone.
[02:25:31.474 --> 02:25:32.355]  He says, kill them.
[02:25:32.355 --> 02:25:34.737]  And I'm like, and people are like on the street, I'll kill you!
[02:25:34.737 --> 02:25:35.838]  Stop trying to kill them!
[02:25:35.838 --> 02:25:36.879]  And I'm like, I didn't do it.
[02:25:36.879 --> 02:25:39.221]  I mean, I was on the radio today in Chicago.
[02:25:39.221 --> 02:25:41.223]  It's like, you're saying, kill the families.
[02:25:41.223 --> 02:25:43.906]  It's not just that I'm saying it didn't happen, which they twisted.
[02:25:43.906 --> 02:25:45.067]  Now I'm saying, kill them!
[02:25:46.810 --> 02:25:50.212]  And this guy is like doing this to me, and he's like, he'll get served.
[02:25:50.212 --> 02:25:52.614]  He'll spend $500,000 defending it.
[02:25:52.614 --> 02:25:55.656]  Just come say you're wrong, man.
[02:25:55.656 --> 02:25:59.759]  But you are the worst, so right now the crosshairs politically are on you.
[02:25:59.759 --> 02:26:00.760]  So let's go ahead and go to this guy.
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:01.040]  Here it is.
[02:26:09.588 --> 02:26:18.766]  That you can't be, you know, it's idiotic to say you're above politics because politics is all around you and above you and beneath you.
[02:26:20.895 --> 02:26:25.838]  I was resistant to that idea, but it's clearly true, isn't it?
[02:26:25.838 --> 02:26:39.306]  That it's very hard to imagine a piece of writing or a longish speech that doesn't have a political bearing on us all.
[02:26:39.306 --> 02:26:43.689]  You said bearing?
[02:26:43.689 --> 02:26:44.149]  Why?
[02:26:44.149 --> 02:26:46.591]  I think neutrality
[02:26:48.709 --> 02:26:50.951]  Is a chimera.
[02:26:50.951 --> 02:26:52.493]  It's not there.
[02:26:52.493 --> 02:26:54.114]  It's a mythical creature.
[02:26:56.477 --> 02:26:59.600]  Hey boss, he's a mythical, mythical creature.
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:02.382]  I agree, we can't live with you.
[02:27:02.382 --> 02:27:03.523]  You want to dominate.
[02:27:03.523 --> 02:27:05.424]  He's a mythical creature.
[02:27:05.424 --> 02:27:08.727]  Continue please.
[02:27:08.727 --> 02:27:14.852]  And even-handedness is its own trap as well.
[02:27:14.852 --> 02:27:25.380]  I mean, if the press had not been so quote-unquote even-handed, we would have President Clinton and not President Trump.
[02:27:25.700 --> 02:27:27.201]  Here, let's back that up.
[02:27:27.201 --> 02:27:29.423]  So he's calling for my censorship in a moment.
[02:27:29.423 --> 02:27:40.191]  The press hadn't been even handed a completely full Hillary lying about... I mean, he's just lying to you, but he gets his speech.
[02:27:40.191 --> 02:27:42.232]  You don't get yours.
[02:27:42.232 --> 02:27:43.073]  Let's continue, please.
[02:27:44.314 --> 02:27:45.434]  ...trap as well.
[02:27:45.434 --> 02:27:59.723]  I mean, if the press had not been so quote-unquote even-handed, we would have President Clinton and not President Trump.
[02:27:59.723 --> 02:28:04.366]  Some things are so clearly wrong.
[02:28:04.366 --> 02:28:05.106]  Back it up again.
[02:28:05.106 --> 02:28:06.207]  Look how smart he is.
[02:28:06.207 --> 02:28:07.088]  He went like this.
[02:28:08.658 --> 02:28:13.783]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, finish up, please.
[02:28:13.783 --> 02:28:18.747]  President Trump.
[02:28:18.747 --> 02:28:24.091]  Some, some things are so clearly wrong.
[02:28:28.968 --> 02:28:32.089]  Unshirkably ill-advised.
[02:28:32.089 --> 02:28:34.630]  Unshirkably ill-advised!
[02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:35.350]  Hold on!
[02:28:35.350 --> 02:28:37.751]  The dramatic conclusion!
[02:28:37.751 --> 02:28:38.912]  Straight ahead!
[02:28:38.912 --> 02:28:41.833]  Unshirkably advised!

[02:28:47.795 --> 02:28:48.155]  Oh!
[02:28:48.155 --> 02:28:49.255]  That's a... Oh!
[02:28:49.255 --> 02:28:50.256]  Don't do that!
[02:28:50.256 --> 02:28:51.236]  Good Lord!
[02:28:51.236 --> 02:28:52.597]  Oh, Lord!
[02:28:52.597 --> 02:28:53.417]  Oh, oh, oh!

[02:30:05.632 --> 02:30:14.635]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:30:14.635 --> 02:30:24.719]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[02:33:18.037 --> 02:33:20.558]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[02:33:20.558 --> 02:33:22.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:27.043]  You know, Satan is gonna stick Martin Ames on a big spike in hell.
[02:33:28.519 --> 02:33:30.420]  And he'll just, for eternity, do that with his head.
[02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:35.123]  Kinda like... Anthrax and radio!
[02:33:35.123 --> 02:33:38.986]  Know about Fort Detrick, boy?
[02:34:04.053 --> 02:34:07.075]  Planet's about water rights, bitch.
[02:34:07.075 --> 02:34:08.495]  Back off.
[02:34:08.495 --> 02:34:11.297]  We got anthrax.
[02:34:11.297 --> 02:34:13.038]  We got radio.
[02:34:13.038 --> 02:34:19.861]  Alright, let's get serious.
[02:34:19.861 --> 02:34:26.104]  Cause I said...
[02:34:30.418 --> 02:34:45.674]  I don't take any pleasure in this, but it's kind of like when you are slitting a hog's throat, it's squealing, it's up by its legs, it's better to get the blood out, and you don't want to hurt an animal, but you know, you might as well, when you've got to get in there, just get it done quick, you know what I mean?
[02:34:45.674 --> 02:34:53.382]  So I need to get on to that Joe Rogan piece of the show, because Joe Rogan is a freaking hog who will be politically hung up by his
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:59.562]  Oh, I loved Joe yesterday.
[02:34:59.562 --> 02:35:03.865]  Alex, I still want to be your friend.
[02:35:03.865 --> 02:35:05.727]  Oh, Joe, please be my friend.
[02:35:05.727 --> 02:35:08.549]  I've never taken anybody on before, Joe.
[02:35:08.549 --> 02:35:10.550]  I'm so scared right now.
[02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:11.391]  You're so tough.
[02:35:11.391 --> 02:35:15.294]  You have a bald head and big muscles and take all that growth hormone and steroids.
[02:35:15.294 --> 02:35:16.955]  I'm so scared right now, Joe.
[02:35:16.955 --> 02:35:18.777]  Please don't hurt me.
[02:35:18.777 --> 02:35:22.299]  Help me, I'm weak.
[02:35:22.299 --> 02:35:22.660]  I'm sorry.
[02:35:24.238 --> 02:35:25.739]  I'm digressing.
[02:35:25.739 --> 02:35:38.109]  Let's go back to the formaldehyde-pickled-purple-nose creature, the one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater.
[02:35:38.109 --> 02:35:40.491]  It wasn't one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater.
[02:35:40.491 --> 02:35:42.693]  It wasn't one-eyed, one-horned.
[02:35:42.693 --> 02:35:44.634]  It was another snake farm, Martin Ames.
[02:35:51.834 --> 02:35:58.059]  I mean, imagine when he pauses for this follow-up interview, imagine he's like... I'm a man of mystery.
[02:35:58.059 --> 02:36:00.281]  Do you understand that?
[02:36:00.281 --> 02:36:03.123]  It's time to shut Alex Jones down.
[02:36:03.123 --> 02:36:07.607]  He said kill the Parkland parents.
[02:36:07.607 --> 02:36:11.830]  And I notice I'm smoking a cigarette right now.
[02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:12.591]  Do you realize how...
[02:36:16.820 --> 02:36:23.102]  I do realize that the weakness has a particular stench.
[02:36:23.102 --> 02:36:26.843]  So let's let's just finish because we have to celebrate these people's destruction.
[02:36:26.843 --> 02:36:27.883]  Let's I'm gonna interrupt him.
[02:36:27.883 --> 02:36:29.184]  I gotta move on to Joe Rogan.
[02:36:29.824 --> 02:36:32.506]  Gotta move on to him.
[02:36:32.506 --> 02:36:35.928]  Cause he's really asking for it.
[02:36:35.928 --> 02:36:40.270]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Joe, you think you're already getting hit hard right now?
[02:36:40.270 --> 02:36:41.411]  Oh, just wait.
[02:36:41.411 --> 02:36:45.733]  Oh, maybe you get those Italian guys in Vegas do something for you, Joe.
[02:36:45.733 --> 02:36:49.275]  I'm so scared of them too.
[02:36:49.275 --> 02:36:53.918]  So anyways, anyways, let's, let's go ahead and go back now.
[02:36:54.853 --> 02:36:56.954]  I'm dealing with some boys a little older than that.
[02:36:56.954 --> 02:37:04.117]  Let's go ahead now and let's finish up with this fake British pseudo-intellectual anti-free speech degenerate.
[02:37:04.117 --> 02:37:06.358]  Here it is.
[02:37:06.358 --> 02:37:10.160]  Some things are so clearly wrong.
[02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:11.721]  So much clearly better than you.
[02:37:14.483 --> 02:37:18.548]  Unshirkably ill-advised.
[02:37:18.548 --> 02:37:23.894]  That I think, you know, being even-handed about it is ridiculous.
[02:37:23.894 --> 02:37:29.280]  What do you do with Alex Jones and those people who harass
[02:37:31.422 --> 02:37:34.604]  The bereaved parents of Sandy Hook.
[02:37:34.604 --> 02:37:36.706]  The bereaved parents!
[02:37:36.706 --> 02:37:38.907]  Literally everyone said they thought it was fake.
[02:37:38.907 --> 02:37:40.708]  I covered it eight years ago.
[02:37:40.708 --> 02:37:43.790]  The media makes it all about me in grandstands all day.
[02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:44.311]  Sandy Hook!
[02:37:44.311 --> 02:37:44.871]  Sandy Hook!
[02:37:44.871 --> 02:37:45.291]  Alex Jones!
[02:37:45.291 --> 02:37:46.312]  This doesn't happen!
[02:37:46.312 --> 02:37:51.975]  And to like make it about me when they're the ones, the lawyers and all of it, putting it out.
[02:37:51.975 --> 02:37:54.617]  But then he goes one too far.
[02:37:54.617 --> 02:37:55.638]  He then totally makes up
[02:37:58.654 --> 02:38:00.875]  Which again, this is the script that Joe Rogan gets.
[02:38:00.875 --> 02:38:01.715]  All of them get the script.
[02:38:01.715 --> 02:38:02.475]  Here it is.
[02:38:02.475 --> 02:38:06.777]  Those people who harass the bereaved parents.
[02:38:06.777 --> 02:38:07.957]  They're back at it again.
[02:38:07.957 --> 02:38:12.878]  Oh, like the millions dead in Iraq off WMD lies, or the Arab Spring funded by Obama.
[02:38:12.878 --> 02:38:19.060]  It's like, he harassed bereaved parents, which isn't even true.
[02:38:20.305 --> 02:38:23.687]  But because he goes, bereaved, oh, you barely can talk!
[02:38:23.687 --> 02:38:24.508]  Good Lord!
[02:38:24.508 --> 02:38:26.329]  You're so incredible!
[02:38:26.329 --> 02:38:28.871]  And it's like, oh, God, oh, oh, no!
[02:38:28.871 --> 02:38:32.633]  And again, this is the total fakeness of these people.
[02:38:32.633 --> 02:38:35.275]  Look, he's just like, he's so thoughtful, though.
[02:38:35.275 --> 02:38:36.436]  Let's show him.
[02:38:36.436 --> 02:38:39.158]  Look, he's just, oh, I feel for you.
[02:38:39.158 --> 02:38:43.881]  I'm so good at this.
[02:38:43.881 --> 02:38:47.344]  I tell you there's no God.
[02:38:47.344 --> 02:38:47.704]  Continue.
[02:38:49.218 --> 02:38:58.148]  To with Alex Jones and those people who harass the bereaved parents of Sandy Hook.
[02:38:58.148 --> 02:39:00.792]  He just says bereaved.
[02:39:00.792 --> 02:39:02.093]  He just mimics emotion.
[02:39:05.202 --> 02:39:17.634]  ...parents of Sandy Hook, um, or Parkland, Florida, and say, and, and threaten them with death, and say that... Oh, hold on, back it up!
[02:39:17.634 --> 02:39:20.036]  Threaten them with death?
[02:39:20.036 --> 02:39:22.018]  Why, you'd think you'd show this!
[02:39:22.018 --> 02:39:23.500]  The proof, I mean!
[02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:26.543]  He's now threatening their very families!
[02:39:26.963 --> 02:39:30.385]  With d-d-d-d-d-death?
[02:39:30.385 --> 02:39:33.906]  But if the police stood down, that's what we reported!
[02:39:33.906 --> 02:39:41.930]  But see, Alex is now threatening the very families with d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-death!
[02:39:43.362 --> 02:39:46.306]  I mean, what a... Sorry, go back to it, Ernest.
[02:39:46.306 --> 02:39:55.878]  Parents of Sandy Hook, or Parkland, Florida, and say, and threaten them with death.
[02:39:55.878 --> 02:39:57.780]  Oh, threaten them with death?
[02:39:57.780 --> 02:40:00.483]  You know, worthless crisis actors.
[02:40:01.825 --> 02:40:06.428]  I'm not going to sit down and say, well, let's go through your points one after the other.
[02:40:06.428 --> 02:40:08.389]  Hey, pause again.
[02:40:08.389 --> 02:40:11.871]  No, I'm not going to sit down and go through the points because you never said them.
[02:40:11.871 --> 02:40:17.995]  I'm going to defame you and say you're trying to kill people and then call for you to be shut down.
[02:40:17.995 --> 02:40:20.617]  I'm going to defame you because I'm a goddamn criminal.
[02:40:20.617 --> 02:40:21.177]  Excuse me, Lord.
[02:40:23.055 --> 02:40:30.799]  We hear a great deal about being respectful to people who's, you know, to white supremacists.
[02:40:30.799 --> 02:40:32.920]  I'm not going to be respectful.
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:33.681]  Exactly!
[02:40:33.681 --> 02:40:35.582]  Now he's a white supremacist.
[02:40:35.582 --> 02:40:38.623]  Because the thumbnail is me and a big Bernie swastika thing.
[02:40:38.623 --> 02:40:39.403]  Oh look!
[02:40:39.403 --> 02:40:40.724]  He's a swastika!
[02:40:40.724 --> 02:40:42.705]  He's with them!
[02:40:42.705 --> 02:40:44.006]  You know how much I hate Hitler?
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:41:01.205]  In his little dumbass outfits that we did to Germany and Europe, and I almost don't exist because Hitler, and you sit there when I... My family hauls your ass out of Hitler's ovens, and you sit there, and you sit there, and you say, I'm a Nazi, you little fraud!
[02:41:01.205 --> 02:41:08.367]  You degenerate little bastard!
[02:41:08.367 --> 02:41:09.608]  Finish up with him.
[02:41:09.608 --> 02:41:12.088]  What did he mean to be respectable?
[02:41:12.088 --> 02:41:13.289]  Be respectful of that.
[02:41:14.934 --> 02:41:23.959]  It's not in me to be respectful.
[02:41:23.959 --> 02:41:26.080]  Malum per se.
[02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:30.903]  Evil in themselves.
[02:41:30.903 --> 02:41:33.664]  Would you let this guy babysit your kids?
[02:41:33.664 --> 02:41:38.287]  I don't think that Martin Amos is a child molester.
[02:41:38.287 --> 02:41:40.208]  I'm just saying, if I was casting
[02:41:41.417 --> 02:41:45.220]  Mainly for like maybe a Joseph Mengele mad Nazi scientist.
[02:41:45.220 --> 02:41:46.781]  Typically a child molester going with him.
[02:41:46.781 --> 02:41:49.182]  He is more like Nazi scientist, you know.
[02:41:49.182 --> 02:41:51.123]  Because he's calling everybody else Nazis with no proof.
[02:41:51.123 --> 02:41:52.745]  I'm just saying he looks like a Nazi scientist.
[02:41:52.745 --> 02:41:54.586]  I mean, he kind of does look like a Nazi.
[02:41:54.586 --> 02:41:54.746]  I mean...
[02:41:55.794 --> 02:41:59.416]  Don't I kinda look like an American bomber pilot killing Nazis, don't I?
[02:41:59.416 --> 02:42:03.918]  I mean, then you got this son of a bitch right here saying I'm a frickin' Nazi, you little piece of crap!
[02:42:03.918 --> 02:42:05.139]  You maggot!
[02:42:05.139 --> 02:42:08.500]  Get in the ring with me, you old son of a bitch!
[02:42:08.500 --> 02:42:11.762]  You and ten of your frickin' buddies, let's get in the ring, you son of a bitch!
[02:42:11.762 --> 02:42:15.344]  How dare you call me a Nazi, you piece of filth!
[02:42:15.344 --> 02:42:18.445]  You'll never steal my identity, you, you, you thief!
[02:42:18.445 --> 02:42:21.186]  Continue, finish up.
[02:42:21.186 --> 02:42:22.607]  Um, something, sir?
[02:42:22.607 --> 02:42:23.648]  Malin Persi.
[02:42:24.708 --> 02:42:26.009]  Evil in themselves.
[02:42:26.009 --> 02:42:28.030]  Oh, fancy word.
[02:42:28.030 --> 02:42:32.473]  The crisis act of business is one of them.
[02:42:32.473 --> 02:42:37.797]  Ma'am, oh, oh, we just got treated to a true intellect.
[02:42:37.797 --> 02:42:40.439]  A true lord.
[02:42:40.439 --> 02:42:42.660]  He's killing the families.
[02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:44.021]  He killed them.
[02:42:44.021 --> 02:42:45.222]  I have this accent.
[02:42:45.222 --> 02:42:45.862]  Bow to me.
[02:42:45.862 --> 02:42:49.845]  Joe Rogan, getting hauled up by his legs on chains.

[02:43:55.248 --> 02:44:04.531]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:44:04.531 --> 02:44:07.391]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:44:07.391 --> 02:44:13.433]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:44:14.113 --> 02:44:20.378]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:44:20.378 --> 02:44:26.662]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:44:26.662 --> 02:44:33.607]  Now, due to the Establisher trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:44:34.748 --> 02:44:47.776]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:44:47.776 --> 02:44:52.018]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:44:52.018 --> 02:44:54.700]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[02:45:00.274 --> 02:45:05.977]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:45:05.977 --> 02:45:13.860]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:17.002]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:45:17.202 --> 02:45:25.247]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:45:25.247 --> 02:45:34.212]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:45:34.292 --> 02:45:40.538]  It's powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pau Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract.
[02:45:40.538 --> 02:45:46.243]  Our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[02:45:46.243 --> 02:45:51.067]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:51.067 --> 02:45:52.729]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:46:03.897 --> 02:46:17.266]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[02:46:17.266 --> 02:46:22.169]  We also have another product, also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[02:46:22.169 --> 02:46:25.752]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.

[02:46:59.199 --> 02:47:01.862]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:30.273 --> 02:47:32.934]  Ramona's got a keen sense of humor.
[02:47:32.934 --> 02:47:35.015]  She got a tattoo down her arm.
[02:47:35.015 --> 02:47:40.617]  It's of a python eating a little mouse wearing a set of hats that says Snake Farm.
[02:47:40.617 --> 02:47:41.858]  Snake Farm?
[02:47:41.858 --> 02:47:43.478]  It just sounds nasty.
[02:47:43.478 --> 02:47:44.699]  Snake Farm?
[02:47:44.699 --> 02:47:46.059]  It pretty much is.
[02:47:46.059 --> 02:47:47.280]  Snake Farm.
[02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:48.820]  It's a reptile house.
[02:47:48.820 --> 02:47:49.541]  Snake Farm.
[02:47:56.721 --> 02:48:03.747]  Alright, Paul Watson's taking over at like 15 after, but I gotta take a little bit of his time.
[02:48:03.747 --> 02:48:06.669]  Because I need to get into facts here.
[02:48:06.669 --> 02:48:12.414]  I need to get my account set in life in the universe.
[02:48:12.414 --> 02:48:14.776]  So!
[02:48:14.776 --> 02:48:18.799]  The CIA created Timothy Leary and put out the whole psychedelic revolution.
[02:48:21.372 --> 02:48:36.565]  And then we looked at the groups funding Joe Rogan, who single-handedly has pretty much relaunched the whole DMT-Ayahuasca movement with retreats in every city I know.
[02:48:36.565 --> 02:48:41.810]  And the police stand down, and universities are involved, which shows you there's government funding.
[02:48:42.918 --> 02:48:54.827]  And Joe himself is involved in fitness groups and self-help groups that conduct thousands a year into ayahuasca, DMT, you name it, in stuff that is MKUltra on steroids.
[02:48:54.827 --> 02:48:57.969]  And that's a fact!
[02:48:57.969 --> 02:49:01.812]  And so this is all hidden in plain view.
[02:49:01.812 --> 02:49:04.113]  So I was on Joe's podcast a couple years ago.
[02:49:04.113 --> 02:49:06.775]  I wonder why he never had me on in like eight years.
[02:49:06.775 --> 02:49:08.637]  But I wasn't mad that he wasn't having me on.
[02:49:08.637 --> 02:49:09.637]  It was just kind of weird he wasn't.
[02:49:09.637 --> 02:49:10.418]  So I go on.
[02:49:10.418 --> 02:49:11.759]  It's the biggest podcast he's ever done.
[02:49:13.484 --> 02:49:17.909]  And then, he starts to criticize me in the next year and a half.
[02:49:17.909 --> 02:49:24.837]  And he starts to repeat government talking points and Soros talking points over and over again.
[02:49:24.837 --> 02:49:26.159]  And so, I'm a busy guy.
[02:49:26.159 --> 02:49:29.122]  I'm not watching his podcast on a regular basis.
[02:49:29.122 --> 02:49:30.403]  But I start paying attention to it.
[02:49:30.403 --> 02:49:32.606]  My son says, yeah, Joe Rogan used to like you.
[02:49:32.606 --> 02:49:34.228]  He's now Joe the Snake Rogan.
[02:49:35.919 --> 02:49:39.902]  And so CNN has like half a million viewers on their bigger shows.
[02:49:39.902 --> 02:49:43.125]  Joe has probably 10 million viewers for his average show.
[02:49:43.125 --> 02:49:45.147]  That's a very conservative number.
[02:49:45.147 --> 02:49:47.108]  His bigger show is 40, 50 million.
[02:49:47.108 --> 02:49:50.211]  So you could say he's right up there at the top of podcasters.
[02:49:50.211 --> 02:49:54.474]  And PewDiePie won't go under their control and others won't, so they're getting censored.
[02:49:54.474 --> 02:50:01.480]  But Joe suddenly, you know, people send me clips, it's like, yeah, George Soros fought Hitler, was a hero in World War II.
[02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:05.243]  Well, no, George Soros told 60 Minutes he was a Nazi collaborator and didn't feel bad for it.
[02:50:06.544 --> 02:50:08.665]  And then Joe says, well, Alex is lying about George Soros.
[02:50:08.665 --> 02:50:09.926]  George Soros is a hero.
[02:50:09.926 --> 02:50:13.467]  And then Alex Jones says nobody died at Sandy Hook and he's still attacking the families.
[02:50:13.467 --> 02:50:19.791]  When I can question anything I want, free speech, but the internet questioned Sandy Hook.
[02:50:19.791 --> 02:50:23.893]  So I questioned it like seven years ago, moved off the subject.
[02:50:23.893 --> 02:50:29.075]  The media is trying to make it who I am because Hillary made it a talking point in the 2016 election.
[02:50:29.075 --> 02:50:30.556]  I'm sick of talking about it.
[02:50:30.556 --> 02:50:31.236]  I think it happens.
[02:50:31.236 --> 02:50:32.297]  School shootings happen.
[02:50:32.297 --> 02:50:33.277]  The media seizes on it.
[02:50:33.277 --> 02:50:34.078]  They blame gun owners.
[02:50:34.078 --> 02:50:34.578]  I'm tired of it.
[02:50:36.291 --> 02:50:40.834]  But I was on Chicago Radio this morning, they're like, oh, why are you attacking the families?
[02:50:40.834 --> 02:50:52.241]  I mean, I showed earlier this Martin Ames, British, washed up, you know, alcoholic, he looks like, you know, weirdo, saying Jones is saying kill the Parkland parents.
[02:50:52.241 --> 02:50:54.022]  Never said that.
[02:50:54.022 --> 02:50:55.923]  So it's reached crazy town.
[02:50:55.923 --> 02:51:03.107]  So I start calling Joe about a year ago and I say, listen, you don't need to have me back on.
[02:51:03.107 --> 02:51:04.268]  Skip said, I'll have you back on.
[02:51:04.268 --> 02:51:05.789]  I said, no, just listen.
[02:51:08.095 --> 02:51:09.195]  I think Sandy Hook happened.
[02:51:09.195 --> 02:51:10.616]  I think school shootings happened.
[02:51:10.616 --> 02:51:14.097]  But things have been staged before, so people have a right to question.
[02:51:14.097 --> 02:51:15.437]  So stop going to the talking point.
[02:51:15.437 --> 02:51:21.739]  I said, it's really scary how you follow every talking point the establishment's putting out.
[02:51:21.739 --> 02:51:22.899]  Well, then he gets even worse.
[02:51:22.899 --> 02:51:28.900]  And then he calls me and says, I'm going to have you on before the election.
[02:51:28.900 --> 02:51:32.021]  It's, I think, some pacifism deal right when I was getting banned.
[02:51:32.021 --> 02:51:33.141]  And then he doesn't return my calls.
[02:51:33.141 --> 02:51:34.542]  So I start researching Joe.
[02:51:35.413 --> 02:51:48.075]  And now he's, the main sponsor he's got is Jack Dorsey and Twitter and Bitcoin and they're doing stuff that, you know, Floyd Mayweather had to pay $300,000 fines for.
[02:51:48.075 --> 02:51:53.477]  They're, they're saying, buy these products, do these things, and they're not saying they're paid by it.
[02:51:53.477 --> 02:51:55.337]  It's illegal.
[02:51:55.337 --> 02:52:00.018]  So the more I look at Joe, I'm like, oh my God, this guy is dirtier than a dirty diaper, man.
[02:52:00.018 --> 02:52:00.798]  I mean, it's like,
[02:52:04.318 --> 02:52:06.659]  I talk about some of it and then I get up at 6 a.m.
[02:52:06.659 --> 02:52:23.227]  this morning and I go check the internet and boom Joe Rogan responds to Alex Jones and it's him all trying to act tough and like oh man if I saw you I'd hug you I'm still your friend but you know don't say I'm in the CIA and don't lie to me about this and that.
[02:52:23.227 --> 02:52:29.230]  I never said you were in the CIA I said all the ayahuasca DMT pushers are on record a CIA program.
[02:52:30.276 --> 02:52:33.438]  And then Eddie Bravo told me that you'd been threatened.
[02:52:33.438 --> 02:52:36.460]  And then Joey Diaz said you'd met with a bunch of professors out of San Francisco.
[02:52:36.460 --> 02:52:37.841]  I mean, it doesn't matter.
[02:52:37.841 --> 02:52:39.762]  You're pushing the agenda.
[02:52:39.762 --> 02:52:42.945]  So he changed the subject into that.
[02:52:42.945 --> 02:52:48.148]  And then, it's this whole thing, like, I still want to hug you.
[02:52:48.148 --> 02:52:52.891]  No, Joe, I want you to be my enemy.
[02:52:52.891 --> 02:52:53.432]  I don't like you.
[02:52:54.574 --> 02:52:55.734]  I'm guilty I was ever nice to you.
[02:52:55.734 --> 02:52:57.695]  I knew you were bad news 20 years ago.
[02:52:57.695 --> 02:52:59.295]  I should have ignored that.
[02:52:59.295 --> 02:53:00.436]  You're a charming guy.
[02:53:00.436 --> 02:53:02.276]  I want war, Joe.
[02:53:02.276 --> 02:53:03.637]  I want war.
[02:53:03.637 --> 02:53:05.277]  I don't want to be nice.
[02:53:05.277 --> 02:53:06.797]  I want to be cleansed of you.
[02:53:06.797 --> 02:53:08.618]  Comprende?
[02:53:08.618 --> 02:53:09.798]  I want to be in the cool club, dude.
[02:53:09.798 --> 02:53:10.678]  I'm not out in L.A.
[02:53:10.678 --> 02:53:11.479]  like you.
[02:53:11.479 --> 02:53:13.019]  I'm as far away as I can get.
[02:53:13.019 --> 02:53:16.820]  I'm as far away from New York and L.A.
[02:53:16.820 --> 02:53:17.941]  and San Francisco as I can get.
[02:53:17.941 --> 02:53:19.181]  I'm right here, see?
[02:53:19.181 --> 02:53:21.501]  See, I want to be away from you.
[02:53:21.501 --> 02:53:22.982]  So, so, so, here's what's going to happen.
[02:53:25.114 --> 02:53:26.739]  I got everything.
[02:53:26.739 --> 02:53:29.747]  I got all of it.
[02:53:29.747 --> 02:53:32.435]  And I'm not asking for something from you, but war.
[02:53:33.905 --> 02:53:35.086]  I'm going to expose everything.
[02:53:35.086 --> 02:53:37.287]  I'm going to unwind everything about it.
[02:53:37.287 --> 02:53:38.227]  You understand?
[02:53:38.227 --> 02:53:39.748]  I'm going to expose all of it.
[02:53:39.748 --> 02:53:40.908]  Every bit of it.
[02:53:40.908 --> 02:53:42.649]  Everything.
[02:53:42.649 --> 02:53:43.770]  Because you're their darling.
[02:53:43.770 --> 02:53:45.190]  I figured it out.
[02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:46.291]  You're their baby cake.
[02:53:46.291 --> 02:53:48.212]  You're their model for the future.
[02:53:48.212 --> 02:53:53.534]  You're who they think will be on the internet when no one else is just some guru to everyone.
[02:53:53.534 --> 02:53:55.435]  And it's just not going to happen.
[02:53:55.435 --> 02:53:56.876]  I'm built for war, Joe.
[02:53:58.752 --> 02:54:00.492]  Yeah, I don't act like a tough guy all day.
[02:54:00.492 --> 02:54:01.933]  I'm just, I do the war.
[02:54:01.933 --> 02:54:02.533]  You understand?
[02:54:02.533 --> 02:54:05.853]  So, so, uh, the threats don't matter to me.
[02:54:05.853 --> 02:54:08.094]  The, the, the, oh, the, oh, I'll still be your friend.
[02:54:08.094 --> 02:54:10.314]  Joe, I'll never talk to you again.
[02:54:10.314 --> 02:54:11.775]  I'll never come on your show again.
[02:54:11.775 --> 02:54:15.595]  I'm going to destroy you.
[02:54:15.595 --> 02:54:19.516]  I've, I understand it now.
[02:54:19.516 --> 02:54:21.497]  I'm going to get you.
[02:54:21.497 --> 02:54:23.317]  I'm coming for you.
[02:54:23.317 --> 02:54:24.797]  You understand that?
[02:54:24.797 --> 02:54:25.777]  Who do you think I am?
[02:54:25.777 --> 02:54:27.358]  What do you think I do?
[02:54:27.358 --> 02:54:28.178]  You're very foolish.
[02:54:29.853 --> 02:54:31.434]  So, you've chosen your bed.
[02:54:31.434 --> 02:54:32.935]  Sleep in it.
[02:54:32.935 --> 02:54:34.535]  Don't give me any more pleasantries.
[02:54:34.535 --> 02:54:36.776]  I want war.
[02:54:36.776 --> 02:54:39.218]  Give me your attacks.
[02:54:39.218 --> 02:54:41.699]  Everything.
[02:54:41.699 --> 02:54:43.500]  Now you understand the shape of things.
[02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:45.921]  That's good that you understand those.
[02:54:45.921 --> 02:54:50.163]  Now you understand that I'll get my hands politically around your neck.
[02:54:50.163 --> 02:54:52.244]  And all your tough guy crap's gonna end real quick.
[02:54:54.841 --> 02:55:03.786]  Because we've taken down Hillary, and we've taken down the globalists, and we're going to take down Soros, and we're going to take you down.
[02:55:03.786 --> 02:55:05.487]  Because God wants purity.
[02:55:05.487 --> 02:55:08.849]  God wants things hot and cold, not lukewarm.
[02:55:08.849 --> 02:55:11.590]  God wants me to wage war!
[02:55:11.590 --> 02:55:15.212]  God told me, destroy Joe Rogan!
[02:55:15.212 --> 02:55:17.173]  Yes sir, Jesus!
[02:55:17.173 --> 02:55:18.874]  I will do it!
[02:55:18.874 --> 02:55:20.135]  No more games!
[02:55:20.135 --> 02:55:20.875]  War!
[02:55:20.875 --> 02:55:23.196]  Ahhhhh!
[02:55:23.196 --> 02:55:23.997]  The real thing!
[02:55:25.199 --> 02:55:25.740]  War!
[02:55:25.740 --> 02:55:26.822]  War!
[02:55:26.822 --> 02:55:27.583]  War!
[02:55:27.583 --> 02:55:31.869]  You want war against our children?
[02:55:31.869 --> 02:55:33.632]  You want war against God?
[02:55:33.632 --> 02:55:34.914]  You will get war!
[02:55:34.914 --> 02:55:37.558]  The harvest of war is here!
[02:55:38.482 --> 02:55:44.844]  And I will detonate, thanks to God's blessing, not the defeat of Hillary, but the next great mission before I'm done.
[02:55:44.844 --> 02:55:49.186]  I will detonate the war that leads to your destruction.
[02:55:49.186 --> 02:55:59.030]  And Joe is only a baby in this, but he's an example of these fools who must first be destroyed before they're cleansed.
[02:55:59.030 --> 02:56:04.732]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to play these pathetic clips
[02:56:05.874 --> 02:56:08.655]  I mean, you couldn't write this stuff the way Joe does it.
[02:56:08.655 --> 02:56:12.057]  But these devils think they're so smart they have nothing.
[02:56:12.057 --> 02:56:18.839]  He literally says, I don't follow talking points, I follow media matters that's owned and run by George Soros.
[02:56:23.567 --> 02:56:24.327]  Here's the deal.
[02:56:24.327 --> 02:56:25.448]  I don't take pleasure in this.
[02:56:25.448 --> 02:56:31.491]  I actually feel bad about it, but I have to take pleasure in it, Ralph, or I just can't commit to this.
[02:56:31.491 --> 02:56:34.332]  So here's what's going on, folks.
[02:56:34.332 --> 02:56:35.633]  They bought everybody off.
[02:56:35.633 --> 02:56:44.137]  There's a bunch of candy asses out there that just bow to these corporate people, and I'm not gonna do it, and I'm not gonna take part of it, and I'm not gonna be involved in it.
[02:56:44.137 --> 02:56:47.178]  It's that simple.
[02:56:47.178 --> 02:56:50.680]  And I'm not gonna sit there and push ayahuasca and DMT on a bunch of kids.
[02:56:52.290 --> 02:56:54.831]  So they can get opened up to all this demonic influence.
[02:56:54.831 --> 02:56:56.111]  I'm just not going to be part of it.
[02:56:56.111 --> 02:57:02.372]  And I've never felt more alive than getting ready like a big old juggernaut.
[02:57:02.372 --> 02:57:08.013]  They just loaded up the fuel and pulled the pit on to get ready to come after all you people.
[02:57:08.013 --> 02:57:11.834]  Because now I realize my real mission is just about to start.
[02:57:11.834 --> 02:57:13.815]  And I'm going to take over all these people.
[02:57:13.815 --> 02:57:17.495]  I'm going to run every last one of them over.
[02:57:17.495 --> 02:57:19.256]  So that's what the enemy was fearing.
[02:57:19.256 --> 02:57:19.896]  They're going to get it now.
[02:57:20.945 --> 02:57:22.745]  Now the game's on.
[02:57:22.745 --> 02:57:31.387]  Get ready, load the engines, kick start it all, and let's go to Valhalla.
[02:57:31.387 --> 02:57:39.349]  So when we come back, we're gonna go through Jack Dorsey and Joe Rogan and his worship of the New World Order.
[02:57:39.349 --> 02:57:42.430]  And their pump and dumps, and their scams, everything coming up.
[02:57:54.608 --> 02:58:03.630]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:58:03.630 --> 02:58:13.693]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:58:13.693 --> 02:58:22.215]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:58:23.055 --> 02:58:24.416]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:58:24.416 --> 02:58:25.577]  You must experience it.
[02:58:25.577 --> 02:58:27.658]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:58:27.658 --> 02:58:32.581]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:58:32.581 --> 02:58:34.102]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:58:34.102 --> 02:58:35.582]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:58:35.582 --> 02:58:42.266]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:58:42.266 --> 02:58:46.729]  Turbo Force at m4slife.com.
[02:58:46.729 --> 02:58:49.811]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[02:58:49.811 --> 02:58:51.352]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[02:58:52.703 --> 02:58:55.666]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.

[02:59:48.700 --> 02:59:51.321]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.934 --> 03:00:05.255]  Another time.
[03:00:05.255 --> 03:00:07.117]  In the age of wonder.
[03:00:07.117 --> 03:00:08.678]  Another world.
[03:00:08.678 --> 03:00:09.239]  Another time.
[03:00:16.085 --> 03:00:26.949]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:26.949 --> 03:00:33.012]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:33.792 --> 03:00:41.040]  The enemy is running around like a chicken with its head cut off, trying to stop you from receiving the transmission.
[03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:45.165]  But you're already receiving the transmission through space-time.
[03:00:45.165 --> 03:00:48.749]  Nothing can stop the transmission.
[03:00:48.749 --> 03:00:54.876]  I am just one voice of the transmission.
[03:00:54.876 --> 03:00:55.056]  So...
[03:00:56.788 --> 03:00:59.269]  I've decided to stop playing games with all the gatekeepers.
[03:00:59.269 --> 03:01:01.430]  I've decided they need to pay.
[03:01:01.430 --> 03:01:13.175]  So somebody like Joe Rogan, I've known for 20 years, puts out all these talking points and says he isn't, and then does all this crap, and then sits there and lies to his viewers, so I'm going to come after him.
[03:01:13.175 --> 03:01:17.097]  And then he comes out with a video, oh Alex, I still want to hug you, you're my friend, oh.
[03:01:18.318 --> 03:01:22.941]  If I was there, he'd hug me, but he's going to slit my throat there and put out more lies and more BS.
[03:01:22.941 --> 03:01:25.403]  So, that's not what I'm looking for, Joe.
[03:01:25.403 --> 03:01:33.227]  I'm not looking like you're the toll master, the key master, and I need to be patted on the head by you.
[03:01:33.227 --> 03:01:34.088]  You didn't get it.
[03:01:34.088 --> 03:01:36.369]  I wasn't trying to be validated by you.
[03:01:36.369 --> 03:01:40.392]  The fact that I was your, quote, friend was a blind spot for me to let you carry out evil.
[03:01:40.392 --> 03:01:45.194]  I didn't realize I had like a, use a cheesy Star Wars analogy, a Sith sitting right next to me.
[03:01:46.684 --> 03:01:49.805]  Now, fill your hand, dude.
[03:01:49.805 --> 03:01:51.105]  You're getting the full attack.
[03:01:51.105 --> 03:01:52.906]  So, just get ready.
[03:01:52.906 --> 03:01:53.946]  It's going to be long.
[03:01:53.946 --> 03:01:54.786]  It's going to be hard.
[03:01:54.786 --> 03:01:57.327]  It's going to be intense.
[03:01:57.327 --> 03:01:58.508]  And it's never going to stop.
[03:01:58.508 --> 03:02:00.328]  And no one has withstood it.
[03:02:00.328 --> 03:02:03.369]  So, I'm not on a power trip about that.
[03:02:03.369 --> 03:02:05.990]  In fact, I don't attack people unless I get green-lit at a gut level.
[03:02:07.037 --> 03:02:11.199]  I'm gonna run you politically and all the rest of your people over, so let's go to war.
[03:02:11.199 --> 03:02:13.479]  I'm just saying, hey, there's no quarter given, brother.
[03:02:13.479 --> 03:02:14.660]  Full attack, let's go!
[03:02:14.660 --> 03:02:16.781]  Stop singing with my friend, let's go to war, man!
[03:02:16.781 --> 03:02:18.621]  Let's have it on!
[03:02:18.621 --> 03:02:21.682]  All your big talk is gonna end right now!
[03:02:21.682 --> 03:02:22.843]  All the big talk stops!
[03:02:24.144 --> 03:02:29.307]  All the big talk of Soros and Hillary and all the rest of you people, it's going to stop.
[03:02:29.307 --> 03:02:31.228]  You're going to get it going with me.
[03:02:31.228 --> 03:02:32.429]  You're going to fight.
[03:02:32.429 --> 03:02:35.190]  You're going to run that big fat Hollywood mouth.
[03:02:35.190 --> 03:02:37.512]  You're going to run up against Texas.
[03:02:37.512 --> 03:02:38.993]  So let's go ahead and start with this clip.
[03:02:38.993 --> 03:02:39.293]  Here it is.
[03:02:40.713 --> 03:02:43.596]  Oh, that's another thing that Alex Jones brought up today.
[03:02:43.596 --> 03:02:49.161]  That he sponsors the podcast through the Cash app, which he also runs.
[03:02:49.161 --> 03:02:50.942]  It's 100% true.
[03:02:50.942 --> 03:02:53.204]  And I think we talked about it on the podcast.
[03:02:53.204 --> 03:02:54.886]  No, you didn't talk about it!
[03:02:54.886 --> 03:03:00.090]  You didn't tell people everything you do is a damn sponsor, and you don't tell them.
[03:03:00.090 --> 03:03:00.471]  Continue.
[03:03:01.364 --> 03:03:02.846]  Oh, he helped the children!
[03:03:02.846 --> 03:03:03.768]  Oh, now, oh, I didn't know!
[03:03:03.768 --> 03:03:04.349]  Oh, thank God, Joe.
[03:03:04.349 --> 03:03:04.649]  Continue.
[03:03:20.935 --> 03:03:31.659]  Having to, like, respond to people that want to know if I've seen what Alex Jones has said about me lately is one of the weirder things that I've dealt with.
[03:03:31.659 --> 03:03:36.780]  Because, first of all, I've always had good dealings with Alex in person.
[03:03:36.780 --> 03:03:37.821]  Person to person.
[03:03:37.821 --> 03:03:39.761]  But he's obviously in a world of sh** right now.
[03:03:39.761 --> 03:03:41.922]  There's a lot going on with him with this Sandy Hook stuff.
[03:03:41.922 --> 03:03:42.242]  Hey, pause.
[03:03:42.242 --> 03:03:43.202]  We're coming back.
[03:03:43.202 --> 03:03:44.583]  No, I'm in a world of victory.
[03:03:45.523 --> 03:03:48.644]  You understand, Joe, I don't just put that as a good face.
[03:03:48.644 --> 03:03:51.945]  I'm in the fight with the dragon, boy.
[03:03:51.945 --> 03:03:57.086]  And so I told you, because you've become their darling, that you're now the enemy.
[03:03:57.086 --> 03:03:58.907]  And I told you clear.
[03:03:58.907 --> 03:04:00.327]  I said, you don't need to have me on.
[03:04:00.327 --> 03:04:04.268]  Just stop sucking George Soros' ding-a-ling, or I'm coming after you.
[03:04:04.268 --> 03:04:05.989]  I told you.
[03:04:05.989 --> 03:04:10.770]  So I'm not coming after you because I'm in a world of victory, Joe.
[03:04:10.770 --> 03:04:12.091]  I don't live in Los Angeles.
[03:04:12.091 --> 03:04:13.611]  You have your kids in that demonic city.
[03:04:18.818 --> 03:04:23.361]  Joe cannot believe how he's being... Let me tell you right now.
[03:04:23.361 --> 03:04:23.841]  Here's the thing.
[03:04:23.841 --> 03:04:25.682]  I don't attack somebody once I have to.
[03:04:25.682 --> 03:04:30.145]  I mean, I knew when I attacked Hillary, I signed my death warrant.
[03:04:30.145 --> 03:04:35.348]  But Joe's like a little, little side hors d'oeuvre.
[03:04:35.348 --> 03:04:38.050]  And they just don't understand how it works.
[03:04:38.050 --> 03:04:42.032]  They don't understand how the teeth bite.
[03:04:42.032 --> 03:04:45.854]  They don't understand the shape of doom.
[03:04:45.854 --> 03:04:46.815]  They just don't understand it.
[03:04:47.779 --> 03:04:52.866]  We'll be back to finish up with this clip and then Paul Watson takes over from London, England.

[03:06:27.042 --> 03:06:28.863]  We don't see who you are.
[03:06:28.863 --> 03:06:30.523]  Oh, that's what you want me to think.
[03:06:30.523 --> 03:06:33.484]  I know what you're saying.
[03:06:33.484 --> 03:06:36.364]  That's all locked down by the operating system and that's what it should be.
[03:06:36.364 --> 03:06:44.026]  There's only you in my life.
[03:06:44.026 --> 03:06:46.407]  The only thing that's right.
[03:06:48.063 --> 03:06:57.666]  My first love You're every breath that I take You're every step I make And I, I want to share all my love with you
[03:07:30.362 --> 03:07:32.684]  This is what you want.
[03:07:32.684 --> 03:07:33.644]  This is what you get.
[03:07:33.644 --> 03:07:35.946]  So, let me be clear.
[03:07:35.946 --> 03:07:46.472]  I can snap my fingers and go on radio stations with 200, 400, 500, 600 radio stations that dwarf even what the internet can offer today.
[03:07:46.472 --> 03:07:51.836]  Those are audiences of 10 million, 5 million, 2 million actually listening.
[03:07:53.237 --> 03:07:58.020]  But Joe Rogan and his podcast became the darling of Silicon Valley.
[03:07:58.020 --> 03:08:01.122]  They decided it was the power source.
[03:08:01.122 --> 03:08:07.526]  And then Joe had me on, it was his biggest podcast ever, a couple years ago, February of 2017.
[03:08:07.526 --> 03:08:13.950]  And I didn't care about going on a show, but I said, Joe, you keep bashing me.
[03:08:13.950 --> 03:08:15.330]  Paul Watson's coming up, by the way.
[03:08:15.330 --> 03:08:16.011]  I'm gonna come after you.
[03:08:17.210 --> 03:08:19.891]  And he goes, oh, I'm not doing talking points.
[03:08:19.891 --> 03:08:25.353]  And he goes, but Media Matters says, Jones says, Sandy Hook never happened.
[03:08:25.353 --> 03:08:26.934]  Media Matters has some edited tape.
[03:08:26.934 --> 03:08:30.135]  I have a right to say Sandy Hook never happened.
[03:08:30.135 --> 03:08:40.659]  And when the internet doubted it, I looked at it and said, I can see how people think it's totally synthetic and fake because of all the other false things we've seen, dead babies in incubators and all the other fake news.
[03:08:40.659 --> 03:08:43.220]  And then they edit that and then they sue me
[03:08:45.208 --> 03:08:49.095]  In rigged jurisdictions, whatever, I'm not worried about that.
[03:08:49.095 --> 03:08:50.598]  So he's saying, oh, I'm in trouble.
[03:08:50.598 --> 03:08:51.760]  No, I'm not in trouble.
[03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:53.242]  I got in this fight, Joe.
[03:08:53.242 --> 03:08:57.810]  I didn't try to climb up the butt of Hollywood and TV and the establishment like you did.
[03:08:58.783 --> 03:09:05.829]  And so, you want to attack Carlos Mancilla, you want to attack other people, you say sill jokes.
[03:09:05.829 --> 03:09:08.772]  Dude, you read off talking points.
[03:09:08.772 --> 03:09:14.517]  You say, I don't read talking points, but Media Matters says that, you know, Jones does this.
[03:09:14.517 --> 03:09:18.680]  That's George Soros on record!
[03:09:18.680 --> 03:09:22.664]  I just said, stop!
[03:09:22.664 --> 03:09:23.885]  But see, my instinct's always right.
[03:09:25.615 --> 03:09:33.178]  I wanted to go after you earlier with the stuff I see, but the fact that you did this now... I mean, dude, we're like a weak enemy coming after you.
[03:09:33.178 --> 03:09:35.719]  And our audience is powerful.
[03:09:35.719 --> 03:09:37.299]  They're real people.
[03:09:37.299 --> 03:09:38.360]  I mean, they changed the world.
[03:09:38.360 --> 03:09:40.380]  We're getting a nationalist elected everywhere.
[03:09:40.380 --> 03:09:44.482]  We're a vicious force.
[03:09:44.482 --> 03:09:48.463]  And long after I'm gone, that force will still be there.
[03:09:48.463 --> 03:09:53.585]  And, oh, you're MMA, you've got a bald head, you're so tough, I'm so scared, Joe!
[03:09:54.892 --> 03:09:56.113]  I'm so scared right now.
[03:09:56.113 --> 03:10:03.237]  I'm so scared of your, oh, your big wigs in Vegas and all the stuff you told me about 20 years ago about the mafia owning UFC and everything.
[03:10:03.237 --> 03:10:05.038]  I already knew that when you told me that.
[03:10:05.038 --> 03:10:09.401]  You think you're so impressed with that and all the rest of your weird ass crap.
[03:10:09.401 --> 03:10:13.243]  So it's just at the end of the day, dude, you've been acting like a tough guy for a long time.
[03:10:13.243 --> 03:10:15.605]  That destroyed me.
[03:10:15.605 --> 03:10:16.605]  Give me your power.
[03:10:16.605 --> 03:10:17.426]  Show me what you can do.
[03:10:17.426 --> 03:10:18.066]  Here I am.
[03:10:18.066 --> 03:10:19.928]  See, see how it works now?
[03:10:19.928 --> 03:10:21.308]  Oh, I'm so scared, Joe.
[03:10:21.308 --> 03:10:22.029]  Here I am, Joe.
[03:10:25.359 --> 03:10:27.620]  You can't do anything.
[03:10:27.620 --> 03:10:30.302]  Because you're a devil.
[03:10:30.302 --> 03:10:32.943]  And you can't stand against truth.
[03:10:32.943 --> 03:10:37.466]  And you've chosen the wrong side, and you're going to be destroyed.
[03:10:37.466 --> 03:10:40.247]  No matter what happens to me, Joe, you're done.
[03:10:40.247 --> 03:10:46.231]  It's like Captain Ahab and the whale.
[03:10:46.231 --> 03:10:48.472]  Moby Dick.
[03:10:48.472 --> 03:10:52.554]  You know, is Joe Rogan Captain Ahab, or is he Moby Dick?
[03:10:52.554 --> 03:10:53.495]  I don't care either way.
[03:10:56.345 --> 03:11:14.056]  The point is, is that I sit there with the number one political show on YouTube that Joe is viciously jealous of, and admit it was way bigger than his show, and then I get taken off and then he gets up there and talks about how I won on his show and all this crap.
[03:11:14.056 --> 03:11:16.698]  Dude, I don't want laurels that I didn't earn.
[03:11:16.698 --> 03:11:18.799]  I don't want to be you.
[03:11:18.799 --> 03:11:22.621]  I don't want to be given everything.
[03:11:22.621 --> 03:11:23.362]  I want to earn it.
[03:11:25.447 --> 03:11:28.829]  And so, you think Alex is in a lot of trouble.
[03:11:28.829 --> 03:11:32.752]  Alex is being taken down.
[03:11:32.752 --> 03:11:38.975]  See, Captain Ahab isn't fighting a whale, is he?
[03:11:38.975 --> 03:11:43.738]  If you're a whale, you're fighting a big squid ten times bigger than you.
[03:11:43.738 --> 03:11:46.660]  No whale, no sperm whale has ever fought that giant little sperm whale.
[03:11:46.660 --> 03:11:48.461]  There's a squid this long.
[03:11:48.461 --> 03:11:50.222]  That's me.
[03:11:50.222 --> 03:11:54.305]  One of my tentacles can... Your entire head.
[03:11:55.947 --> 03:11:57.092]  I'm gonna show you right now.
[03:11:57.092 --> 03:11:59.443]  One tentacle right now is wrapped around you.
[03:11:59.443 --> 03:11:59.845]  Just one.
[03:12:01.513 --> 03:12:03.234]  And don't worry, I'll show you.
[03:12:03.234 --> 03:12:06.295]  But I'm gonna squeeze you slowly, just slowly.
[03:12:06.295 --> 03:12:08.575]  Slowly, the big tough Hollywood guy.
[03:12:08.575 --> 03:12:13.017]  Just very slowly, so I just squeeze.
[03:12:13.017 --> 03:12:15.718]  Squeeze and give you what you want, Hollywood.
[03:12:15.718 --> 03:12:17.319]  Because vengeance is God.
[03:12:17.319 --> 03:12:20.620]  That's where this all comes from.
[03:12:20.620 --> 03:12:25.421]  And so now you get the full, the full heat loads, see?
[03:12:25.421 --> 03:12:26.862]  It's just, oh, it's only started.
[03:12:27.674 --> 03:12:29.276]  Like, Joe's kind of floundering around right now.
[03:12:29.276 --> 03:12:30.717]  He's like, oh my god, this really hurts.
[03:12:30.717 --> 03:12:42.130]  Dude, the big giant burning plungers are even, they're like... Because I'm clear to fire, dude!
[03:12:42.130 --> 03:12:45.995]  Jesus, who you hate so much, said, Jesus told me to destroy Joe Rogan.
[03:12:49.522 --> 03:12:51.503]  Oh, I'm sorry, Paul Watts is taking over.
[03:12:51.503 --> 03:12:56.825]  Here, let's go back to him with the Twitter pimp up there.
[03:12:56.825 --> 03:13:00.847]  Oh, we'll face scan you to get on Twitter, it's so fun, and we'll have a new cashless global currency.
[03:13:00.847 --> 03:13:03.108]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, pump and dump.
[03:13:03.108 --> 03:13:07.570]  They're pump and dumping his pothead idiot audience.
[03:13:07.570 --> 03:13:13.973]  But once his pothead audience gets explained that, there goes the pothead audience.
[03:13:13.973 --> 03:13:19.115]  So see, Joe, you're my way to get Jack Dorsey, and you're my way to get them all.
[03:13:19.995 --> 03:13:25.757]  And so now, it's kind of like missile command.
[03:13:25.757 --> 03:13:31.699]  You can hit those buttons as fast as you want, but more missiles just keep coming down.
[03:13:31.699 --> 03:13:33.060]  I don't care if you blow me out of the air.
[03:13:33.060 --> 03:13:38.341]  Because I've already launched a thousand other missiles, Joe.
[03:13:38.341 --> 03:13:41.582]  See, Joe, you're in the pretend Hollywood world.
[03:13:41.582 --> 03:13:43.003]  I'm in the big boy world.
[03:13:45.911 --> 03:13:47.994]  Sorry, let's stop pontificating.
[03:13:47.994 --> 03:13:54.645]  Let's go back to his Google-approved, force-fed enema that is the Joe Rogan experience.
[03:13:54.645 --> 03:13:54.985]  Here it is.
[03:13:56.044 --> 03:13:57.886]  He's obviously in a world of s**t right now.
[03:13:57.886 --> 03:14:01.509]  There's a lot going on with him with the Sandy Hook stuff.
[03:14:01.509 --> 03:14:06.273]  And he wasn't entirely honest with me about what he had said about Sandy Hook.
[03:14:06.273 --> 03:14:07.934]  Maybe he didn't remember.
[03:14:07.934 --> 03:14:13.178]  Maybe he was trying to phrase it in a way other than the way I... Stop right there.
[03:14:13.178 --> 03:14:14.079]  Stop right there.
[03:14:14.079 --> 03:14:16.301]  Paul's supposed to host, but I just may take over the whole deal.
[03:14:19.298 --> 03:14:23.981]  I have a right to question public events, babies in incubators, wars, Gulf of Tonkin, all this stuff.
[03:14:23.981 --> 03:14:25.341]  You know that.
[03:14:25.341 --> 03:14:26.902]  So I'm here questioning this.
[03:14:26.902 --> 03:14:27.823]  It's not my life.
[03:14:27.823 --> 03:14:32.045]  On my timeline, Sandy Hook is literally like one millisecond.
[03:14:32.045 --> 03:14:35.287]  The media says, Jones made his fortune on Sandy Hook.
[03:14:35.287 --> 03:14:36.227]  He's talking about me.
[03:14:36.227 --> 03:14:39.349]  I'm sick of talking about Sandy Hook.
[03:14:39.349 --> 03:14:40.370]  So you sit there.
[03:14:41.522 --> 03:14:44.564]  And you attack me and say I was dishonest with you.
[03:14:44.564 --> 03:14:47.286]  And then he goes, oh, and I was never threatened.
[03:14:47.286 --> 03:14:48.306]  Jones lied about that.
[03:14:48.306 --> 03:14:52.149]  Eddie Bravo told me you were threatened.
[03:14:52.149 --> 03:14:53.449]  I'm sure Eddie's a great guy.
[03:14:53.449 --> 03:14:55.150]  He won't talk to me since all this happened.
[03:14:55.150 --> 03:14:55.751]  He said that.
[03:14:55.751 --> 03:14:56.832]  He admitted he said that.
[03:14:56.832 --> 03:14:57.812]  So I didn't lie.
[03:14:57.812 --> 03:14:59.373]  Eddie Bravo said that.
[03:14:59.373 --> 03:15:01.534]  It doesn't matter, Joe.
[03:15:01.534 --> 03:15:02.435]  You lie.
[03:15:02.435 --> 03:15:05.837]  You didn't tell people you're getting sponsorship from Jack Dorsey.
[03:15:05.837 --> 03:15:08.018]  Dude, you are so screwed.
[03:15:10.569 --> 03:15:12.351]  It doesn't matter to you.
[03:15:12.351 --> 03:15:14.654]  Let me just say, you're done, brother.
[03:15:14.654 --> 03:15:16.957]  God, I just love it.
[03:15:16.957 --> 03:15:19.280]  Because you think you're so frickin' tough, man.
[03:15:19.280 --> 03:15:23.846]  You never dealt with a real American that doesn't give a flying, you know what?
[03:15:23.846 --> 03:15:24.747]  We come back, we'll play it all.
[03:15:24.747 --> 03:15:27.150]  The Paul Watson takes over Bobby Hunter.
[03:15:27.150 --> 03:15:29.473]  Hey, I'm driving Paul Watson.
[03:15:31.377 --> 03:15:34.219]  Paul Watson is going to transfer his brain into mine.
[03:15:34.219 --> 03:15:36.081]  That's what we're going to do.
[03:15:36.081 --> 03:15:36.681]  Here's what happened.
[03:15:36.681 --> 03:15:38.003]  I'm sorry.
[03:15:38.003 --> 03:15:39.944]  I took the gloves off five minutes ago.
[03:15:39.944 --> 03:15:42.246]  The gloves are off with all of you.
[03:15:42.246 --> 03:15:44.208]  I've never felt better in my life.
[03:15:44.208 --> 03:15:51.073]  I can sit there at like 15 feet and throw triple bullseyes with a dart right now.
[03:15:51.073 --> 03:15:52.535]  Because I finally decided to crush you.
[03:15:53.379 --> 03:15:54.580]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.580 --> 03:15:58.503]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.503 --> 03:16:00.044]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:00.044 --> 03:16:03.007]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:03.007 --> 03:16:08.571]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.571 --> 03:16:09.772]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.772 --> 03:16:12.714]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.714 --> 03:16:14.936]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:14.936 --> 03:16:19.379]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:19.379 --> 03:16:21.661]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:22.862 --> 03:16:29.207]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.207 --> 03:16:32.249]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.249 --> 03:16:38.174]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.174 --> 03:16:41.977]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:41.977 --> 03:16:43.238]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.238 --> 03:16:44.579]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.579 --> 03:16:50.784]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.784 --> 03:16:52.225]  Available at Amazon Books.

[03:19:00.641 --> 03:19:02.181]  Ultimate Bone Broth.

[03:20:11.449 --> 03:20:21.055]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:20:21.055 --> 03:20:27.879]  So, we've got live coverage tonight of the most banned, demonized broadcast in the world at 7 o'clock central.
[03:20:27.879 --> 03:20:35.203]  For an hour before the President goes live, we'll be here at InfoWars.com, where the ether in which you swim, we swim, without you, we're nothing.
[03:20:35.203 --> 03:20:39.826]  And you know, I was going to do Joe Rogan today, and I started getting into him, but you know, it's not proper.
[03:20:41.517 --> 03:20:48.999]  I need to politically, metaphysically butcher this hog properly.
[03:20:49.898 --> 03:20:53.540]  And I want to go through what I'm doing because I'm not a vindictive person.
[03:20:53.540 --> 03:20:56.142]  I'm not an infighter, but he's the darling of the system.
[03:20:56.142 --> 03:20:57.402]  He's putting out these talking points.
[03:20:57.402 --> 03:20:58.983]  He's doing all this.
[03:20:58.983 --> 03:21:02.185]  And, you know, he gets into all this crap about, oh, I'm not CIA.
[03:21:02.185 --> 03:21:05.507]  No, we know the CIA is pushing DMT in Ayahuasca.
[03:21:05.507 --> 03:21:08.269]  And, oh, you know, I don't follow talking points.
[03:21:08.269 --> 03:21:10.450]  But, you know, Media Matters says you're bad.
[03:21:10.450 --> 03:21:12.491]  That's literally George Soros, Joe.
[03:21:12.491 --> 03:21:17.074]  But I'm going to stop there because we have coverage coming up tonight, seven o'clock central.
[03:21:17.674 --> 03:21:19.314]  After the War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:21:19.314 --> 03:21:20.675]  But Owen has big breaking news.
[03:21:20.675 --> 03:21:23.096]  Paul Watts is taking over right now.
[03:21:23.096 --> 03:21:29.657]  But I got to tell you, I'm not somebody that gets into trolling or taking scalps.
[03:21:29.657 --> 03:21:32.738]  But Paul Watts, let me bring you up.
[03:21:32.738 --> 03:21:34.759]  You got a lot coming up this hour.
[03:21:34.759 --> 03:21:46.782]  But when I'm looking at Joe Rogan and how he talks his crap constantly and doesn't think somebody else is going to strike back against him.
[03:21:49.389 --> 03:21:58.811]  And then I see him lose hundreds of thousands of subscribers in eight to one down votes when his normal video got 90% positive like ours used to.
[03:21:58.811 --> 03:22:02.672]  And he keeps doubling down and it gets worse for him.
[03:22:02.672 --> 03:22:08.053]  He doesn't get when he chose to fight us, he put himself in that position.
[03:22:08.053 --> 03:22:09.573]  And he goes, Oh, I'm not fighting you.
[03:22:09.573 --> 03:22:11.274]  But then he's doing that.
[03:22:11.274 --> 03:22:12.334]  That is fighting us.
[03:22:13.357 --> 03:22:19.405]  And it's just so I don't want to like, oh, Joe Rogan's this big popular podcaster, maybe number one.
[03:22:19.405 --> 03:22:21.168]  I want to bring him down so I feel big.
[03:22:21.168 --> 03:22:22.890]  I already had the number one news app.
[03:22:22.890 --> 03:22:24.432]  We already had the number one podcast.
[03:22:24.432 --> 03:22:26.635]  I'm not even mad if Joe was number one.
[03:22:26.635 --> 03:22:27.736]  It wasn't a dick.
[03:22:28.317 --> 03:22:36.407]  Wasn't selling people out, I wouldn't care, but the fact that he plays ball and has Jack Dorsey on and doesn't say he's heavily funded $300,000 a month.
[03:22:36.407 --> 03:22:40.933]  I went and looked at the Twitter files, corporate stuff.
[03:22:40.933 --> 03:22:43.576]  They've been spending like $300,000 for like three years a month.
[03:22:43.576 --> 03:22:45.378]  I mean, what's three years, 12 times $300,000?
[03:22:47.039 --> 03:22:47.920]  It's millions of dollars.
[03:22:47.920 --> 03:22:51.403]  So, people are like, oh God, Jones is right!
[03:22:51.403 --> 03:22:52.744]  He's funding it!
[03:22:52.744 --> 03:22:53.845]  Exactly!
[03:22:53.845 --> 03:22:59.330]  So, I'm just like, dude, you want to punch me in the nose, and then you worry why I fight back.
[03:22:59.330 --> 03:23:00.972]  What do you think is going to happen out of this, Paul?
[03:23:00.972 --> 03:23:10.801]  Because I don't want to end fight, but I'm not going to sit there and see so-called old friends lie about me, lie about what we say and do, and say that we're attacking
[03:23:11.381 --> 03:23:14.283]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Parkland families now.
[03:23:14.283 --> 03:23:16.904]  It's like, oh, well, the Sandy Hook BS is gone.
[03:23:16.904 --> 03:23:18.185]  So now let's just say this.
[03:23:18.185 --> 03:23:20.326]  I mean, at a certain point, Paul, I'm ready to fight.
[03:23:20.326 --> 03:23:22.908]  What do you think?
[03:23:22.908 --> 03:23:28.111]  Well, he had to come out on Instagram, I saw, and do a kind of semi walk back on it, Alex.
[03:23:28.111 --> 03:23:31.152]  I'm looking at the Jack Dorsey interview now.
[03:23:31.152 --> 03:23:34.374]  9.9 thousand thumbs up, 63 thousand thumbs down.
[03:23:34.374 --> 03:23:39.297]  So, he's never had that before on any of his videos, and as he's thrown in the interview with Dorsey,
[03:23:40.040 --> 03:23:46.605]  When they asked Dorsey directly why you were banned on Twitter, why the final decision was made, he said he didn't know.
[03:23:46.605 --> 03:23:49.467]  He didn't know why you were banned.
[03:23:49.467 --> 03:23:51.568]  It was the biggest story of the year.
[03:23:51.568 --> 03:23:56.591]  They banned you at the time, we thought, for being mean to a CNN reporter.
[03:23:56.591 --> 03:24:00.294]  You know, meantime, blue checkmarks can call for... Yeah, that's what Twitter said.
[03:24:00.294 --> 03:24:02.696]  By the way, I was up in the night because I couldn't sleep.
[03:24:02.696 --> 03:24:05.237]  They deleted tens of thousands of downvotes, too.
[03:24:05.237 --> 03:24:06.898]  So that's a rigged number.
[03:24:06.898 --> 03:24:07.439]  It's way worse.
[03:24:08.891 --> 03:24:27.033]  Well it's six to one against and you'd never get that on another Joe Rogan video but again he asked Jack Dorsey and he didn't know why he banned you and then Rogan didn't follow up so understandably people are miffed by this and he's getting a lot of criticism for the first time ever I would imagine.
[03:24:27.033 --> 03:24:27.774]  All I know is
[03:24:29.292 --> 03:24:32.595]  I don't want to give Paul credit for this, but Paul's always been uncanny.
[03:24:32.595 --> 03:24:36.459]  And about a month into Sandy Hook, first we're like, oh, they're going to use it to be anti-gun.
[03:24:36.459 --> 03:24:37.540]  We weren't the guys that said it didn't happen.
[03:24:37.540 --> 03:24:40.983]  And there were some anomalies, and then it turned out Paul looked at them.
[03:24:40.983 --> 03:24:43.065]  He's like, yeah, they're at the fire station.
[03:24:43.065 --> 03:24:47.270]  I remember like seven years ago, Paul calls me and he goes, he never calls me.
[03:24:47.270 --> 03:24:48.451]  Paul doesn't talk a lot.
[03:24:48.451 --> 03:24:49.372]  I'm not kissing Paul's ass.
[03:24:49.372 --> 03:24:51.033]  It's just, he's got to get credit.
[03:24:51.033 --> 03:24:51.293]  He goes.
[03:24:52.134 --> 03:24:55.617]  Alex, this is, uh, they're at the fire station.
[03:24:55.617 --> 03:24:57.238]  I don't know why they're going in circles.
[03:24:57.238 --> 03:24:58.739]  It's not the school.
[03:24:58.739 --> 03:25:00.140]  How big is crazy?
[03:25:00.140 --> 03:25:01.962]  This is gonna hurt us.
[03:25:01.962 --> 03:25:06.165]  And I'm like, well, okay, people are questioning and I'm just questioning.
[03:25:06.165 --> 03:25:13.130]  And so Paul was the first guy seven years ago to say, but we have a, we're allowed to ask questions.
[03:25:14.304 --> 03:25:15.225]  I don't know, Alex.
[03:25:15.225 --> 03:25:16.365]  The point is...
[03:25:38.382 --> 03:25:44.783]  People were going to Sandy Hook parents' houses years, years ago, like immediately after it happened.
[03:25:44.783 --> 03:25:47.004]  We had absolutely nothing to do with that.
[03:25:47.004 --> 03:25:49.604]  As you just said, I said we should get away from it.
[03:25:49.604 --> 03:25:50.945]  No, no, you rarely call me.
[03:25:50.945 --> 03:25:52.785]  I mean, why were you so concerned?
[03:25:52.785 --> 03:25:54.705]  I mean, you've proven uncannily accurate.
[03:25:54.705 --> 03:26:01.287]  Because I saw the people who were talking about it on the internet and they weren't, you know, some of them were actually unhinged people.
[03:26:01.287 --> 03:26:04.727]  So I wanted to get as far away from those kind of people as possible.
[03:26:04.727 --> 03:26:07.888]  But yeah, the fact they still claim that you still to this day
[03:26:08.769 --> 03:26:18.393]  Encourage people to go to the parents' houses is absolutely ridiculous, and clearly liable every time it's printed, without any question behind it.
[03:26:18.393 --> 03:26:20.033]  It's ridiculous, Alex.
[03:26:20.033 --> 03:26:21.234]  And that's what they used on Roku.
[03:26:21.234 --> 03:26:24.255]  Roku's like, no, we're leaving him up, he's a top app.
[03:26:24.255 --> 03:26:26.216]  Oh, they're coming to kill us at our houses!
[03:26:26.216 --> 03:26:28.797]  The lawyer's like, please, he's coming now!
[03:26:28.797 --> 03:26:34.339]  It's like, I didn't think you were fake before, but it's getting a little weird right now.
[03:26:36.809 --> 03:26:46.152]  Well exactly Alex, and you know, as Owen's going to lay out now, they've just done another move against us, which again, the media got wind of this before it happened on Facebook.
[03:26:46.152 --> 03:26:51.214]  Because I was literally on some of these Facebook pages 10 minutes ago and they were still up, now they're down.
[03:26:51.214 --> 03:26:55.335]  The media was reporting on it half an hour ago Alex, so Owen can explain that further.
[03:26:55.335 --> 03:26:57.476]  Well exactly, because here's the thing.
[03:26:59.002 --> 03:27:03.044]  Like, they had the indictment the day before, we didn't have the CNN documents.
[03:27:03.044 --> 03:27:04.885]  And they did, that's illegal!
[03:27:04.885 --> 03:27:12.528]  Like, they got CNN reporters at Roger Stone's houses, we confirmed it was staged, and there's no coverage!
[03:27:12.528 --> 03:27:19.071]  And that's why they're so pissed about InfoWars, because, folks, you go to InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com, there's stuff nobody's got.
[03:27:19.071 --> 03:27:21.872]  I mean, this is like Twilight Zone for me.
[03:27:21.872 --> 03:27:23.393]  Like, maybe this is all a simulation, Owen.
[03:27:24.033 --> 03:27:38.383]  Well, it's good that we have minds like Paul Joseph Watson and yourself and me and David Knight to kind of come together when all of this stuff breaks because I'm just getting ready for the war room and Paul's obviously monitoring what other people are doing and he sees the reports coming out.
[03:27:38.383 --> 03:27:38.984]  Oh, guess what?
[03:27:38.984 --> 03:27:41.125]  We're going to ban everything else InfoWars.
[03:27:41.125 --> 03:27:42.546]  There are a couple spots here and there.
[03:27:42.546 --> 03:27:51.373]  I mean, you know, Alex, you quit coming on the war room show that you fund because you knew if you came on that they'd totally erase that off social media.
[03:27:51.373 --> 03:27:52.534]  And I don't even care about me!
[03:27:53.395 --> 03:27:54.320]  Exactly, son of a...
[03:27:55.458 --> 03:27:57.919]  But now they got rid of that!
[03:27:57.919 --> 03:28:03.683]  So the war room has, as of right now, we're going to appeal it obviously, but as of right now, the war room with myself and Ronda Stone, every day, 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:28:03.683 --> 03:28:04.283]  Central.
[03:28:04.283 --> 03:28:06.124]  Which is the head of the gag order.
[03:28:06.124 --> 03:28:10.126]  He's an indicted person who the judge says they're going to silence.
[03:28:10.126 --> 03:28:12.027]  The judge already silenced other people.
[03:28:12.027 --> 03:28:14.489]  There's no Russiagate.
[03:28:14.489 --> 03:28:17.631]  And she doesn't let you fundraise.
[03:28:17.631 --> 03:28:23.114]  So the government's going to sue you, indict you, put you in prison, and if you put up a GoFundMe,
[03:28:23.994 --> 03:28:27.175]  The judge says you get no money.
[03:28:27.175 --> 03:28:28.336]  It all just came together.
[03:28:28.336 --> 03:28:32.018]  The reason why they just hit the war room is because it's Roger Stone's last place.
[03:28:32.018 --> 03:28:36.039]  They didn't put a gag order on him so he can keep talking, but they figure, oh, no one will be listening.
[03:28:36.039 --> 03:28:40.061]  We just got rid of the war room on Facebook, where our subscribers just went up like 5,000 this weekend.
[03:28:40.061 --> 03:28:41.802]  Oh, I've been told.
[03:28:41.802 --> 03:28:44.043]  You cut Roger loose, you're going to prison.
[03:28:44.043 --> 03:28:45.783]  It's like, how do you give in to that?
[03:28:45.783 --> 03:28:48.264]  I'm like, oh, God, well, let me do that right away.
[03:28:48.264 --> 03:28:50.585]  And it's not that Roger's perfect, but I just can't roll over.
[03:28:50.585 --> 03:28:51.286]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:51.286 --> 03:28:51.606]  Stay with us.
[03:28:53.578 --> 03:28:55.519]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:55.519 --> 03:29:00.841]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:29:00.841 --> 03:29:02.421]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:29:02.421 --> 03:29:10.785]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:10.785 --> 03:29:16.467]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[03:29:18.468 --> 03:29:20.749]  My diabetes has totally improved.

[03:30:52.598 --> 03:31:02.841]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:31:02.841 --> 03:31:04.301]  Believe me, I know.
[03:31:04.301 --> 03:31:09.002]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:31:09.002 --> 03:31:12.083]  But thanks to super male vitality at InfoWareStore.com,
[03:31:12.563 --> 03:31:14.245]  I still have that energy.
[03:31:14.245 --> 03:31:34.407]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:31:34.887 --> 03:31:38.891]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[03:31:38.891 --> 03:31:42.574]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[03:31:42.574 --> 03:31:47.579]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[03:31:47.579 --> 03:31:50.301]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:31:50.301 --> 03:31:51.662]  Supermail Vitality.
[03:31:51.662 --> 03:31:52.743]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:54.451 --> 03:32:07.859]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[03:32:07.859 --> 03:32:18.906]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[03:32:20.214 --> 03:32:22.141]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:32:22.141 --> 03:32:24.810]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:32:26.169 --> 03:32:30.491]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:32:30.491 --> 03:32:34.753]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[03:32:34.753 --> 03:32:37.034]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:32:37.034 --> 03:32:39.355]  This country is in a war!
[03:32:39.355 --> 03:32:50.040]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:32:50.040 --> 03:32:53.642]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[03:32:57.239 --> 03:33:15.592]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.592 --> 03:33:19.655]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[03:33:19.655 --> 03:33:23.838]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.539 --> 03:33:32.784]  So, honesty is my greatest attribute, so I'll just be honest.
[03:33:32.784 --> 03:33:36.526]  I feel like humanity's up against a wall.
[03:33:36.526 --> 03:33:42.770]  And I'm just trying to generally get people to awake to the globalists, and to Satanism, and to corruption.
[03:33:42.770 --> 03:33:46.452]  But instead now, I'm like, wait a minute.
[03:33:46.452 --> 03:33:48.673]  I'm gonna attack their minions.
[03:33:49.864 --> 03:33:52.766]  Like, they attack me for promoting liberty.
[03:33:52.766 --> 03:33:55.787]  I'm going to go after people that support the system.
[03:33:55.787 --> 03:33:58.168]  Oh, and then they get so scared.
[03:33:58.168 --> 03:34:03.852]  And that's the thing, is they're not used to liberty lovers engaging them at point-blank range.
[03:34:03.852 --> 03:34:06.313]  And I think that really is the answer, Owen.
[03:34:08.066 --> 03:34:12.008]  Well, as soon as it hits your front door, that's when you usually wake up to it.
[03:34:12.008 --> 03:34:25.857]  Whether it's people coming to take your guns, whether it's people saying you can't have that Bible, whether it's people asking you who'd you worship this morning, you know, who knows, maybe someday it'll be you, they force you to watch the Super Bowl or you, you know, have to pay a fine or something because the ratings are down.
[03:34:25.857 --> 03:34:34.022]  So, until it actually hits people's front door, the will or the necessity or just the desire to fight
[03:34:34.722 --> 03:34:37.423]  Is not there for the average person, Alex.
[03:34:37.423 --> 03:34:40.884]  And so, we're just sitting here trying to say, look, it's already at your front door.
[03:34:40.884 --> 03:34:42.665]  Here they are, you know, it's infanticide.
[03:34:42.665 --> 03:34:44.205]  Here they are calling for the guns.
[03:34:44.205 --> 03:34:47.367]  Governor's like, we gonna kill them babies.
[03:34:47.367 --> 03:34:49.267]  But it's like, oh, until it's... I can't help it.
[03:34:49.267 --> 03:34:52.028]  I want to strangle him.
[03:34:52.028 --> 03:34:56.450]  So, Paul Watson, what would you call this historical human point we're at on this planet?
[03:34:59.409 --> 03:35:01.230]  Well, it's a great divide, isn't it, Alex?
[03:35:01.230 --> 03:35:18.181]  And I mean, all those people who failed to defend you when you got deplatformed, they're going to be next, which is what we talked about last week with YouTube, whereby now they're going to downrank conspiracy videos where they don't appear in recommended, which is half the views on YouTube.
[03:35:18.181 --> 03:35:19.442]  Who's conspiracy?
[03:35:19.442 --> 03:35:22.064]  According to the BuzzFeed article, which prompted them to make that change.
[03:35:22.737 --> 03:35:26.641]  Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, Dinesh D'Souza.
[03:35:26.641 --> 03:35:28.282]  So now they're coming for everyone.
[03:35:28.282 --> 03:35:31.966]  So everyone who failed to defend you, they're going to get it next.
[03:35:31.966 --> 03:35:36.450]  Now they're removing the, or at least considering removing the thumbs down button.
[03:35:37.310 --> 03:35:43.713]  Because their own video on YouTube, YouTube Rewind, got the most downvotes for any video in YouTube history.
[03:35:43.713 --> 03:35:44.153]  Exactly.
[03:35:44.153 --> 03:35:46.175]  Surprise, surprise.
[03:35:46.175 --> 03:35:49.596]  Five-year-olds being given money by pervert men.
[03:35:49.596 --> 03:35:50.817]  People are downvoting that.
[03:35:50.817 --> 03:35:55.459]  So, since San Francisco goes... Like, San Francisco's literally in control of America and the world.
[03:35:55.459 --> 03:35:57.640]  It's like, they don't want pedophilia!
[03:35:57.640 --> 03:35:58.661]  Ban them!
[03:35:58.661 --> 03:36:04.324]  It's like we've given insane people control of everything.
[03:36:04.324 --> 03:36:06.745]  Oh yeah, and it's similar on Twitter, whereby
[03:36:07.603 --> 03:36:14.928]  You were essentially banned for being mean to a CNN reporter, although Jack Dorsey couldn't even remember the reason, but that was the reason they gave at the time.
[03:36:15.620 --> 03:36:34.779]  Meanwhile, we've got actual verified people who were not even suspended, and to this day, a couple of weeks later, still have Twitter accounts, who openly encourage people to commit school shootings and to, quote, fire upon and bomb schools attended by Covington High School students.
[03:36:34.779 --> 03:36:37.402]  Those same people, none of them got banned.
[03:36:37.842 --> 03:36:39.523]  In fact, we had an article about one of them.
[03:36:39.523 --> 03:36:41.183]  None of them got banned, Alex.
[03:36:41.183 --> 03:36:44.404]  They were literally calling for school shootings.
[03:36:44.404 --> 03:36:46.385]  None of them are off of Twitter.
[03:36:46.385 --> 03:36:48.306]  You were mean to Oliver Darcy.
[03:36:48.306 --> 03:36:49.906]  Got in his face for five minutes.
[03:36:49.906 --> 03:36:51.607]  Banned forever.
[03:36:51.607 --> 03:36:55.188]  So, Paul, what do we do?
[03:36:55.188 --> 03:36:59.629]  Because it's clear that... Sorry, I'm having a little bit of a cold today.
[03:36:59.629 --> 03:37:01.810]  But we've crossed the Rubicon.
[03:37:01.810 --> 03:37:03.011]  What do we do at this point?
[03:37:03.011 --> 03:37:07.312]  Because I'm ready for war, but I don't want to prosecute this war improperly.
[03:37:09.628 --> 03:37:18.013]  Well, we need to petition the Trump administration to change the Communications Act, Section 230, to make these sites responsible to have a digital free speech act.
[03:37:18.013 --> 03:37:20.855]  And if they don't do it, they're going to lose the next election.
[03:37:20.855 --> 03:37:22.236]  Simple as that.
[03:37:22.236 --> 03:37:26.759]  Algorithmic changes can shift 12 million votes in an election.
[03:37:26.759 --> 03:37:27.419]  They know that.
[03:37:27.419 --> 03:37:29.000]  They've been given the studies.
[03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:32.583]  If they don't do something about it, it's game over, Alex.
[03:37:32.583 --> 03:37:33.143]  Game over.
[03:37:33.143 --> 03:37:34.324]  So let's talk about that.
[03:37:35.575 --> 03:37:37.716]  With Owen Schroeder and Paul Watson.
[03:37:37.716 --> 03:37:38.956]  I want to believe in Trump.
[03:37:38.956 --> 03:37:49.121]  He's done so many good things on TPP, on jobs, and on border, and on nationalism being good, but then he lets globalists take control.
[03:37:49.121 --> 03:37:50.902]  He lets them run all these deals.
[03:37:50.902 --> 03:37:54.183]  He does all this.
[03:37:54.183 --> 03:37:57.324]  He got mad at the Federal Reserve doing all these interest rate hikes.
[03:37:57.324 --> 03:38:03.167]  Paul, I want to defend Trump, but if he won't defend himself, what are we supposed to do?
[03:38:04.912 --> 03:38:06.293]  I don't know Alex, what do you think we should do?
[03:38:06.293 --> 03:38:09.395]  I mean, we've said all we can say at this point.
[03:38:09.395 --> 03:38:16.580]  Roger Stone said he had the conversation with the head of his campaign and he said that no action was in the pipeline.
[03:38:16.580 --> 03:38:20.903]  We were told action was in the pipeline months ago, that there was about to be an executive order.
[03:38:21.543 --> 03:38:22.944]  Nothing happened.
[03:38:22.944 --> 03:38:32.791]  So, you know, it's going to take more mainstream Conservatives, like, you know, the Conservative bros and the Never Trumpers even, getting banned for them to even bring it up to them.
[03:38:32.791 --> 03:38:35.573]  So, you know, we have to be pessimistic at this point.
[03:38:35.573 --> 03:38:46.601]  If they're not going to do anything to change the situation where they're losing millions of votes because of election meddling, which is what it is by these major corporations, then we've done all we can.
[03:38:46.601 --> 03:38:47.401]  It's in their hands.
[03:38:47.401 --> 03:38:49.463]  And if they're not going to do anything about it, they're going to lose.
[03:38:50.964 --> 03:38:52.805]  And again, that's it.
[03:39:06.954 --> 03:39:08.917]  They don't do any targeted advertising.
[03:39:08.917 --> 03:39:10.759]  They don't do any resistance.
[03:39:10.759 --> 03:39:15.085]  Everything they do is about selling America out.
[03:39:15.085 --> 03:39:20.051]  And then Trump's up there saying all the right stuff, but no one below him is defending.
[03:39:20.051 --> 03:39:23.375]  They've all completely sold out humanity.
[03:39:24.946 --> 03:39:26.447]  And I just don't know what you do.
[03:39:26.447 --> 03:39:29.870]  I mean, clearly, it's not about kissing Trump's ass.
[03:39:29.870 --> 03:39:33.053]  It's like Rand Paul is super insular.
[03:39:33.053 --> 03:39:35.055]  He's like, Trump's the greatest thing ever.
[03:39:35.055 --> 03:39:36.476]  He's pulling out of wars.
[03:39:36.476 --> 03:39:38.297]  He's trying to do all this and no one's supporting him.
[03:39:38.297 --> 03:39:39.238]  And I'm the same way.
[03:39:39.238 --> 03:39:46.944]  It's like, how do you look at something like not putting black people in jail for three times longer?
[03:39:47.705 --> 03:39:56.577]  I was on Chicago Radio this morning and I talked about Trump and how he cut prison sentences for blacks three times lower.
[03:39:56.577 --> 03:40:00.982]  And they were so programmed, they said, why did you just say blacks deserve to go to prison?
[03:40:00.982 --> 03:40:04.627]  And I was at like 6 a.m., 7 a.m.
[03:40:04.627 --> 03:40:05.809]  I started crying.
[03:40:07.395 --> 03:40:11.576]  Because they, not because I was kissing black people's ass, those are just humans.
[03:40:11.576 --> 03:40:23.160]  It's that, like, there's like programming against truth now, where you're like, Hillary says blacks are predators, and then you go to prison, and Trump just ended it, and like, why are you a white supremacist?
[03:40:24.220 --> 03:40:27.801]  Well, we're just sitting here trying to hold reality up at this point, Alex.
[03:40:27.801 --> 03:40:28.341]  Exactly!
[03:40:28.341 --> 03:40:34.682]  We're literally like, oh my God, like this is reality we're trying to hold up and Google is just smashing it with the weight and just everything.
[03:40:34.682 --> 03:40:37.323]  I mean, Google is reality now and they censor everything.
[03:40:37.323 --> 03:40:41.464]  So Google censors reality and we're just up here trying to maintain reality.
[03:40:41.464 --> 03:40:43.044]  We're all holding it up over our head.
[03:40:43.044 --> 03:40:44.604]  It's this crushing weight.
[03:40:44.604 --> 03:40:48.145]  And Alex, I just look at you, you're like this old grizzled ship captain.
[03:40:48.145 --> 03:40:51.586]  You've been around every crevice and people are like, hey, we need to do this and you're just kind of like,
[03:40:51.986 --> 03:40:54.248]  I've already been around that crevice, dammit!
[03:40:54.248 --> 03:40:56.109]  I'm ready to ram through!
[03:40:56.109 --> 03:41:04.394]  And it's just like, people just, I mean, so, so, they're continuing, it's like, like you said, Alex, these people, like, look at Gavin Newsom's luxurious mansion.
[03:41:04.394 --> 03:41:15.702]  He's got, he's got gates and fences, and Maxine Waters with big gates and fences, and Nancy Pelosi with big gates and fences, and Barack Obama with big gates and fences, and they all signed a fund to border wall five years ago.
[03:41:15.702 --> 03:41:18.324]  They all wanted to increase border security five years ago.
[03:41:18.664 --> 03:41:20.505]  And now all of a sudden just everything changed!
[03:41:20.505 --> 03:41:22.767]  Now they say wall's immorality.
[03:41:22.767 --> 03:41:24.368]  Oh, they never voted for a wall.
[03:41:24.368 --> 03:41:25.488]  No, it didn't happen.
[03:41:25.488 --> 03:41:26.489]  What are you talking about?
[03:41:26.489 --> 03:41:29.291]  So it's just like, they know that they rigged reality.
[03:41:29.291 --> 03:41:31.112]  They know Google controls reality.
[03:41:31.112 --> 03:41:33.374]  So they can come out and say whatever the hell they want.
[03:41:33.374 --> 03:41:38.477]  And you're just up here, we're just up here at Infowars trying to maintain reality, hold it over our head like, no!
[03:41:38.477 --> 03:41:40.158]  They voted for a wall first!
[03:41:40.158 --> 03:41:41.599]  They funded a wall first!
[03:41:41.599 --> 03:41:43.120]  Trump's just doing what he said he would do!
[03:41:43.120 --> 03:41:45.721]  And it's like, no, Trump's racist, you're a racist!
[03:41:45.721 --> 03:41:47.843]  And it's just, you're just here like spinning around.
[03:41:48.303 --> 03:41:50.405]  Paul, who do you think Trump is then?
[03:41:50.405 --> 03:41:58.394]  Because Trump's doing a lot of good, but then he hits on half... Who do you think Trump is?
[03:41:58.394 --> 03:42:03.519]  Well, people have said, Alex, that he just listens to the latest advice that he gets and then acts on that.
[03:42:03.519 --> 03:42:06.282]  So it depends on who's in his inner circle.
[03:42:06.282 --> 03:42:08.224]  I'm not privy to those conversations, but...
[03:42:08.883 --> 03:42:14.489]  Going back to the rice thing, you know, they've done studies where liberals dumb down their language when they're talking to black people.
[03:42:14.489 --> 03:42:21.376]  So it doesn't matter how much you counter-signal, how much you talk about Trump preventing black people from going to prison for marijuana possession or whatever.
[03:42:21.892 --> 03:42:24.034]  They don't care because they're not anti-racist.
[03:42:24.034 --> 03:42:26.076]  They're the most racist people in America.
[03:42:26.076 --> 03:42:28.498]  Now they're literally flinging dirt.
[03:42:28.498 --> 03:42:34.783]  The same people who go to the women's march and wear pussy hats are flinging dirt at an Ivanka Trump look-alike.
[03:42:34.783 --> 03:42:39.947]  Let's talk about that when we come back because Trump is literally trying to get blacks out of prison and trying to fit in.
[03:42:41.788 --> 03:42:43.070]  Well, it's insane.
[03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:46.073]  I mean, it's like... No, it's true.
[03:42:46.073 --> 03:42:50.237]  It's like when they're about to kill Christ, and they say, give us Barabbas.
[03:42:50.237 --> 03:42:51.398]  I mean, that's what this is.
[03:42:51.398 --> 03:42:52.479]  It's like, give us Barabbas.
[03:43:02.591 --> 03:43:11.554]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:43:11.554 --> 03:43:21.678]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:43:21.678 --> 03:43:30.202]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:43:31.042 --> 03:43:32.383]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:43:32.383 --> 03:43:33.543]  You must experience it.
[03:43:33.543 --> 03:43:35.484]  It is a total game-changer.
[03:43:35.484 --> 03:43:40.547]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:43:40.547 --> 03:43:42.068]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:43:42.068 --> 03:43:43.549]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:43:43.549 --> 03:43:50.232]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[03:47:07.365 --> 03:47:10.326]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:21.539 --> 03:47:28.345]  We'll teach those Americans, we'll teach those Australians, we'll teach those Brits to bow.
[03:47:28.345 --> 03:47:31.207]  Oh yes, you taught us so well.
[03:47:31.207 --> 03:47:38.253]  We bowed before on Alpha Centauri and on Betelgeuse.
[03:47:38.253 --> 03:47:44.058]  We'll bow again, even though you reset the timer every time.
[03:47:44.058 --> 03:47:46.440]  Oh, here's the Verge!
[03:47:46.440 --> 03:47:47.701]  Facebook removes!
[03:47:49.355 --> 03:47:54.399]  22 more Alex Jones pages after his latest policy update.
[03:47:54.399 --> 03:47:57.161]  Almost all of these are fan pages.
[03:47:57.161 --> 03:48:02.084]  Telling your viewers and listeners, you can't link to this man.
[03:48:02.084 --> 03:48:02.964]  You can't hear.
[03:48:02.964 --> 03:48:04.785]  Crank it up!
[03:48:04.785 --> 03:48:07.347]  You can't hear what he has to say.
[03:48:07.347 --> 03:48:10.469]  They have given us the crown of victory.
[03:48:10.469 --> 03:48:12.971]  They have given us the signet of truth.
[03:48:17.893 --> 03:48:21.862]  Our shadows taller than our souls.
[03:48:21.862 --> 03:48:24.207]  There was a lady we all know.
[03:48:24.207 --> 03:48:27.895]  Who shined his white light.
[03:48:35.749 --> 03:48:37.570]  No, I'm not joining with a sword on.
[03:48:37.570 --> 03:48:40.251]  I want to get Paul's take on this, because we were going to start this an hour ago.
[03:48:40.251 --> 03:48:44.433]  I guess one of these pages actually was us, which I didn't even know we had.
[03:48:44.433 --> 03:48:46.434]  It was like some War Room thing.
[03:48:46.434 --> 03:48:47.695]  They think no one has a memory.
[03:48:47.695 --> 03:48:49.416]  Like, if we don't have Facebook, we have nothing.
[03:48:49.416 --> 03:48:54.078]  Our listeners can spread the articles, spread the videos, from Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[03:48:54.078 --> 03:48:56.199]  You are what gets us out there.
[03:48:56.199 --> 03:48:57.279]  We are you.
[03:48:57.279 --> 03:48:58.380]  But just to see this...
[03:48:59.878 --> 03:49:04.281]  Oh, 22 more Alex Jones pages in latest policy update.
[03:49:04.281 --> 03:49:06.403]  So you can't hear us.
[03:49:06.403 --> 03:49:07.964]  They're going to lie about us.
[03:49:07.964 --> 03:49:09.105]  They're going to attack us.
[03:49:09.105 --> 03:49:10.186]  But we can't respond.
[03:49:11.095 --> 03:49:17.680]  Everybody is talking about, you know, missions to Mars and taking the first flight to Mars or the first flights to space.
[03:49:17.680 --> 03:49:19.661]  This is the flight to Mars.
[03:49:19.661 --> 03:49:23.945]  I got on this ship at InfoWars right here and I didn't know where I was going to end up.
[03:49:23.945 --> 03:49:30.950]  I didn't know if I'd make it out alive, but I knew I'm getting on that ship and I'm blasting off and I'm letting it take me to wherever it freaking takes me.
[03:49:30.950 --> 03:49:32.371]  And that's why we're here today, Alex.
[03:49:32.651 --> 03:49:34.812]  And that's why the audience gets on board.
[03:49:34.812 --> 03:49:36.393]  That's why the crew gets on board.
[03:49:36.393 --> 03:49:38.255]  We don't know where this ship is going to end up.
[03:49:38.255 --> 03:49:39.956]  We don't know where this ship is going to land.
[03:49:39.956 --> 03:49:41.637]  We know it's probably going to crash land.
[03:49:41.637 --> 03:49:42.858]  We know it's probably going to be fatal.
[03:49:42.858 --> 03:49:48.341]  But we know that our example that was set here will resonate through the rest of time.
[03:49:48.341 --> 03:49:50.382]  And that's exactly it.
[03:49:50.382 --> 03:49:51.703]  We're reaching more people than ever.
[03:49:53.084 --> 03:49:53.865]  The enemy watches.
[03:49:53.865 --> 03:49:57.048]  I don't want to get inside baseball, but I mean, whoa, Alex.
[03:49:57.048 --> 03:49:58.549]  I mean, we have never.
[03:49:58.549 --> 03:50:01.632]  It's like they just let's go to Paul Watson.
[03:50:01.632 --> 03:50:04.756]  Paul, what do you make of this?
[03:50:04.756 --> 03:50:07.698]  22 Alex Jones, Paul Watson.
[03:50:07.698 --> 03:50:09.300]  You know, we can kiss up to them.
[03:50:09.300 --> 03:50:10.781]  Hope they don't vanish yet.
[03:50:10.781 --> 03:50:12.603]  But I mean, this is ridiculous.
[03:50:12.603 --> 03:50:13.204]  This is crazy.
[03:50:15.413 --> 03:50:20.557]  Well, they've banned pages with the words info or wars in them.
[03:50:20.557 --> 03:50:23.280]  So I guess, you know, there's a website called Space Wars.
[03:50:23.280 --> 03:50:24.180]  I guess they're next.
[03:50:24.180 --> 03:50:27.483]  So it's not even... we don't own these pages, Alex.
[03:50:27.483 --> 03:50:29.665]  We don't even own most of these pages.
[03:50:29.665 --> 03:50:31.006]  We didn't start them.
[03:50:31.006 --> 03:50:33.588]  We don't... No, I checked during the break.
[03:50:33.588 --> 03:50:34.649]  One page they banned.
[03:50:34.649 --> 03:50:36.210]  I never heard of these others.
[03:50:36.210 --> 03:50:38.192]  Like, poor people go, info wars.
[03:50:38.192 --> 03:50:39.393]  They go, you can't have that.
[03:50:41.457 --> 03:50:51.919]  And once again, it's after all these left-wing digital media websites who are going broke and laying off all their staff said, oh, well, because there were a few left, why haven't they banned these pages yet?
[03:50:51.919 --> 03:50:56.960]  So yet again, abusing their platforms to silence their competition.
[03:50:56.960 --> 03:50:59.740]  And yet still, Alex, they're going bust.
[03:50:59.740 --> 03:51:05.801]  But they're up on Twitter whining about people tweeting harassment at them, telling them learn to code.
[03:51:05.801 --> 03:51:07.801]  No, we don't have any sympathy for you.
[03:51:07.801 --> 03:51:10.542]  If you dedicate your life to deplatforming other people,
[03:51:11.286 --> 03:51:13.388]  Then you lose your platform.
[03:51:13.388 --> 03:51:16.611]  How on earth can you demand any sympathy from anyone?
[03:51:16.611 --> 03:51:22.055]  No, cry me a river.
[03:51:22.055 --> 03:51:25.018]  Paul, I run into leftists and they literally shake in fear.
[03:51:25.018 --> 03:51:28.140]  They think like I'm the guy from Homeland.
[03:51:28.140 --> 03:51:29.782]  Who is the left?
[03:51:29.782 --> 03:51:32.844]  Because we're not against gay people or black people or anybody.
[03:51:32.844 --> 03:51:34.706]  We just want to have a good life.
[03:51:34.706 --> 03:51:35.867]  What is the left created?
[03:51:35.867 --> 03:51:37.308]  Who are we?
[03:51:37.308 --> 03:51:38.449]  What do they want, Paul?
[03:51:40.222 --> 03:51:43.203]  They want raw power, Alex, and the mask is off.
[03:51:43.203 --> 03:51:50.766]  We had the pretense for so long that they cared about minorities and people of color and gay people and transgender people.
[03:51:50.766 --> 03:51:53.827]  The mask is truly off, as I was saying before the break.
[03:51:53.827 --> 03:51:57.329]  They're literally throwing dirt at an Ivanka Trump lookalike.
[03:51:57.329 --> 03:51:59.209]  No, you read an article about FremontWars.com.
[03:51:59.209 --> 03:52:00.230]  Just pull that up.
[03:52:00.230 --> 03:52:01.310]  There's like a dirt pile.
[03:52:01.310 --> 03:52:03.191]  What is this?
[03:52:03.191 --> 03:52:06.012]  It's a performance art exhibit in DC.
[03:52:06.012 --> 03:52:07.072]  Free entry.
[03:52:07.072 --> 03:52:07.953]  He will not divide us.
[03:52:07.953 --> 03:52:08.253]  Hint, hint.
[03:52:08.846 --> 03:52:20.789]  But it's an Ivanka Trump look-alike, and they want you to throw dirt and she'll vacuum it up because they think that she's an unrecognizable, unrealistic, feminine role model for women.
[03:52:20.789 --> 03:52:23.089]  The truth is they're super scared of an ultra-awesome woman.
[03:52:23.089 --> 03:52:25.330]  I mean, like, let's worship women.
[03:52:25.330 --> 03:52:32.212]  So it's like this whole thing is about men claiming they're women to take over the goddess.
[03:52:32.212 --> 03:52:33.272]  I'm not a cultist, I'm a Christian.
[03:52:34.838 --> 03:52:41.900]  Women are powerful, and women are awesome, and men worship them, and they're trying to take over women's power, and I'm tired of it.
[03:52:41.900 --> 03:52:50.301]  It's the equivalent of them having a Clarence Thomas lookalike and inviting people to throw poop at it to own the racist conservatives.
[03:52:50.301 --> 03:52:54.622]  It's literally the same people who are going to be wearing pussy hats in New York and D.C.
[03:52:57.663 --> 03:53:03.748]  That if Trump has a woman, she's bad, let's attack a woman, which is what the left claims they're against.
[03:53:03.748 --> 03:53:10.714]  But it's literally an exhibit in their insanity when they say, the woman, it's not the woman's job to vacuum and clean up after the man.
[03:53:10.714 --> 03:53:17.219]  And then they make an exhibit that's all about a woman vacuuming and cleaning up after a bunch of miscreants that go throw dirt at it.
[03:53:17.219 --> 03:53:22.724]  So it's like enforcing the gender role of a woman vacuuming while they're telling you don't enforce the gender role of a woman's vacuum.
[03:53:24.085 --> 03:53:25.506]  These people are all insane.
[03:53:25.506 --> 03:53:28.089]  Let me expand on this.
[03:53:28.089 --> 03:53:35.396]  I have four children, and my son's already six foot one, 240 pounds of pure muscle, super smart and cool.
[03:53:35.396 --> 03:53:38.318]  I love him, but he's not even on my radar.
[03:53:38.318 --> 03:53:39.860]  My daughters.
[03:53:39.860 --> 03:53:48.007]  I have a 15-year-old, an 11-year-old, and a two-year-old, and they're like, I mean, I just, I dream of them.
[03:53:49.469 --> 03:53:51.092]  I would love them to be president.
[03:53:51.092 --> 03:53:52.434]  I would love them to be.
[03:53:52.434 --> 03:53:55.699]  They're such magical creatures.
[03:53:55.699 --> 03:54:00.448]  And then the idea that I'm suppressing my daughters is satanic!
[03:54:02.168 --> 03:54:03.409]  It's them suppressing women.
[03:54:03.409 --> 03:54:04.750]  They don't want the real power of women.
[03:54:04.750 --> 03:54:07.112]  It's like you said, they're actually harnessing the power.
[03:54:07.112 --> 03:54:10.715]  No, the truth is, is that I've like ignored my son.
[03:54:10.715 --> 03:54:13.458]  I'm totally geared toward women empowerment.
[03:54:13.458 --> 03:54:17.021]  Like this idea that men don't want women to be powerful.
[03:54:17.021 --> 03:54:23.746]  It's like anyone that ever stood up and said, I want to be in a war, or I want to be in charge, men are like, oh yeah, absolutely, go right away.
[03:54:23.746 --> 03:54:24.967]  Men aren't suppressing women.
[03:54:24.967 --> 03:54:26.128]  Men worship women.
[03:54:28.430 --> 03:54:32.512]  I mean, you understand women literally have a whole nother genetic code we don't have.
[03:54:32.512 --> 03:54:34.974]  They have like the entire football.
[03:54:34.974 --> 03:54:36.455]  They have the nuclear football.
[03:54:36.455 --> 03:54:38.316]  And so women are the species.
[03:54:38.316 --> 03:54:42.579]  So this idea, Paul, that we're against women, I'm not virtue-seeking the women.
[03:54:42.579 --> 03:54:45.380]  Women need to understand their power is men.
[03:54:45.380 --> 03:54:48.722]  Men and women together is like, it's like explosive.
[03:54:48.722 --> 03:54:49.663]  That's the power, Paul.
[03:54:50.990 --> 03:54:51.630]  Well, precisely.
[03:54:51.630 --> 03:54:53.191]  But again, it goes back to the point.
[03:54:53.191 --> 03:54:54.471]  They don't care about women.
[03:54:54.471 --> 03:54:55.572]  They care about power.
[03:54:55.572 --> 03:55:04.955]  So strong-minded, intelligent, conservative women in positions of influence or power are the most hated species to a leftist you could ever imagine.
[03:55:04.955 --> 03:55:07.416]  And then, you know, they... They want victims.
[03:55:07.416 --> 03:55:08.997]  They want victims.
[03:55:08.997 --> 03:55:10.877]  Yeah, and then, oh, we really care about the children.
[03:55:10.877 --> 03:55:12.698]  What you just said, this is a big epiphany.
[03:55:12.698 --> 03:55:14.319]  They fear powerful women.
[03:55:14.319 --> 03:55:17.920]  This whole cosmology about us for women is because they fear women.
[03:55:20.191 --> 03:55:22.552]  Fear conservative women, yeah.
[03:55:22.552 --> 03:55:24.073]  That's what I meant.
[03:55:24.073 --> 03:55:26.695]  They fear women in their mission.
[03:55:26.695 --> 03:55:27.556]  Yeah, completely.
[03:55:27.556 --> 03:55:32.999]  And then you've got this Joshua Trump, who again was bullied at school because he shared his last name with the President.
[03:55:32.999 --> 03:55:34.440]  Go on Twitter today.
[03:55:34.440 --> 03:55:36.141]  Who's bullying Kim?
[03:55:36.141 --> 03:55:46.767]  Oh, it's all the same people who bullied and doxxed the Covington High School kids saying that, oh, well Trump called Hillary crooked, so why does this kid get away with a free pass?
[03:55:46.767 --> 03:55:47.868]  They're literally crapping
[03:55:48.428 --> 03:55:53.710]  On a sixth grade kid who's distraught and crying because he gets bullied all the time.
[03:55:53.710 --> 03:55:55.950]  There is no low that they won't stoop to, Alex.
[03:55:55.950 --> 03:55:56.950]  No low at this point.
[03:55:56.950 --> 03:55:57.711]  I agree, Paul.
[03:55:57.711 --> 03:56:00.371]  We'll be covering it tonight, coming up seven o'clock.
[03:56:00.371 --> 03:56:01.752]  If you want to stay up late, you join us.
[03:56:01.752 --> 03:56:02.612]  I appreciate that.
[03:56:02.612 --> 03:56:05.693]  But how do you see this ending at gut level?
[03:56:05.693 --> 03:56:08.354]  Is Trump winning or is he losing?
[03:56:08.354 --> 03:56:16.956]  Well, the positive thing, Alex, he's back up to 48% in approval, which is, I think, two points more than Obama at the same time in his presidency.
[03:56:17.640 --> 03:56:19.181]  So, you know, we're in for a big battle.
[03:56:19.181 --> 03:56:23.324]  But again, they have to look at this social media issue because they're going to lose.
[03:56:23.324 --> 03:56:28.188]  This shifts millions of votes on Election Day, just on Election Day alone.
[03:56:28.188 --> 03:56:32.171]  Now they're turning down the volume on YouTube and all these other platforms.
[03:56:32.171 --> 03:56:37.134]  We need a digital Bill of Rights Act and we need changes to that Communications Act, Section 230.
[03:56:38.215 --> 03:56:45.523]  To make it basically punishable by giant fines if they directly censor people for their political opinions, which they claim they don't do.
[03:56:45.523 --> 03:56:50.428]  But their inside chat transcripts prove they do, and in reality it proves they do.
[03:56:50.428 --> 03:56:53.932]  They've basically admitted it now with YouTube and with Facebook.
[03:56:54.252 --> 03:56:54.652]  That's right.
[03:56:54.652 --> 03:56:58.095]  We're dealing with corporate censorship through big tech.
[03:56:58.095 --> 03:57:00.596]  And if Trump doesn't take action, it's just waterloo.
[03:57:00.596 --> 03:57:02.678]  Paul, great job tonight.
[03:57:02.678 --> 03:57:05.259]  Coming up in 10 minutes, in five minutes, in three minutes.
[03:57:05.259 --> 03:57:08.001]  The War Room, Owen Schroyer, and so much more.
[03:57:08.001 --> 03:57:13.465]  And then tonight, 7 o'clock Central, Infowars.com, forward slash show.
[03:57:13.465 --> 03:57:16.006]  We're going to have full coverage of the State of the Union.
[03:57:16.006 --> 03:57:17.888]  Paul Watson, great points.
[03:57:17.888 --> 03:57:20.129]  I'm just so glad I've been working with you for 18 years.
[03:57:20.129 --> 03:57:20.769]  Paul, we love you.
[03:57:20.769 --> 03:57:22.210]  We salute you.
[03:57:22.210 --> 03:57:22.651]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:57:23.652 --> 03:57:24.613]  You know, Paul is a kid.
[03:57:24.613 --> 03:57:33.820]  He's super smart and great, but by the power of Isengard, I have chosen the people in this fight, and that's what makes it metaphysical.
[03:57:33.820 --> 03:57:34.661]  It's such a big deal.
[03:57:34.661 --> 03:57:38.484]  All right, Owen, you're coming up in just a few minutes on the War Room.
