[00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:30.815]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the most banned broadcast in the free world.
[00:00:32.596 --> 00:00:33.676]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:35.117 --> 00:00:42.181]  And we are live from the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas on this May 24th, 2019.
[00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:42.721]  And I've got a
[00:00:50.586 --> 00:01:16.663]  Message coming up in the next segment that I think you need to hear But before we get to that You know they call Donald Trump Especially over there at CNN whose ratings are have just totally bottomed out if it wasn't for airports and hotels and bars CNN would have no audience
[00:01:19.224 --> 00:01:32.592]  But so they call Trump the Infowars president, and the last couple days we've been highlighting how Nancy Pelosi has been a jibbering fool, embarrassing herself.
[00:01:32.832 --> 00:01:37.175]  I made the comment the other day, if she's not drunk, this is actually really sad.
[00:01:37.755 --> 00:01:45.380]  You're watching an elderly woman disintegrate mentally right in front of your very eyes.
[00:01:47.344 --> 00:01:52.706]  But she keeps going after Trump and lying about Trump, so she wants to play hardball.
[00:01:53.186 --> 00:02:04.430]  And so the InfoWars president, much like InfoWars, decided to put out a video of Nancy and said, stammering Nancy, so crazy.
[00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.811]  And they try to claim the video is doctored, but we'll get to that fake news story.
[00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:14.533]  Here is the clip, though, that President Trump tweeted out of crazy Nancy.
[00:02:16.212 --> 00:02:20.234]  We had a little, it took a little longer on the floor.
[00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:23.235]  Custody of the border.
[00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:27.657]  Everyone started sending signals.
[00:02:27.857 --> 00:02:29.478]  The US, Mexico, Canada.
[00:02:31.346 --> 00:02:32.847]  That's not the accurate character.
[00:02:32.887 --> 00:02:35.669]  Some people call it AFTA-NAFTA, some call it NAFTA 2.0.
[00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.993]  We're working together to make past that.
[00:02:41.013 --> 00:02:45.316]  There's three things.
[00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:46.236]  There's three things.
[00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:47.177]  There's three things.
[00:02:47.337 --> 00:02:48.098]  There's three things.
[00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:49.579]  We're very busy people.
[00:02:50.882 --> 00:02:54.063]  Okay, last time I checked, this is three, not this.
[00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:55.824]  It was worse yesterday.
[00:02:55.864 --> 00:02:57.024]  We played another clip.
[00:02:57.044 --> 00:02:59.945]  She could not put a subject with a predicate in the same sentence.
[00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:00.686]  What's going on?
[00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:03.967]  You know, obviously, I'm 76 years old.
[00:03:04.047 --> 00:03:07.328]  She's a couple years older than I am, and we all age a little differently.
[00:03:07.748 --> 00:03:09.429]  My sense is she has a very big job.
[00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.629]  I think she's getting worn down.
[00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.650]  She's always very neat, very proper.
[00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.312]  I think she's very inarticulate, which she's never been in the past, and I think to a certain extent
[00:03:18.153 --> 00:03:20.895]  She needs to step in the background and not be out front as much.
[00:03:21.095 --> 00:03:23.957]  She could be the point person leading the Democrats.
[00:03:24.017 --> 00:03:32.925]  Nancy Pelosi now being actually controlled and whipped by her own radical branch of the Democratic Party.
[00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:33.865]  She's here.
[00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:36.527]  Go ahead and give her the entire handle of Everclear.
[00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.629]  She'll be fine.
[00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.270]  Don't go along with her.
[00:03:40.891 --> 00:03:43.493]  This is just the clip from Lou Dobbs.
[00:03:43.513 --> 00:03:44.194]  You saw the video.
[00:03:47.716 --> 00:03:49.918]  Trump tweets out Pelosi stammers through news conference.
[00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:50.358]  I mean, look.
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.800]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.781]  You feel bad.
[00:03:56.141 --> 00:04:03.845]  You feel bad, I guess, poking fun at a deranged old lady who clearly is not mentally fit.
[00:04:03.865 --> 00:04:05.887]  I mean, you know, she's not all there.
[00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:13.571]  She needs really... We need to have drug testing for our congressmen and women is what we need.
[00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:15.327]  And it doesn't even matter.
[00:04:15.347 --> 00:04:17.548]  You can get busted having cocaine or whatever.
[00:04:17.588 --> 00:04:18.128]  It doesn't matter.
[00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:20.808]  But we need to know what the hell's wrong with Nancy Pelosi.
[00:04:20.908 --> 00:04:21.968]  She's not all there.
[00:04:22.048 --> 00:04:23.549]  She's mentally gone.
[00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:24.649]  And you can see it.
[00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:30.090]  In fact, at the end of this press conference, she like begins to walk off the set and she starts like talking to people all awkwardly.
[00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:40.892]  So either Nancy Pelosi is a severe alcoholic who hasn't been sober in decades or I really honestly feel bad for this woman because she gone.
[00:04:43.117 --> 00:04:44.919]  But this is the third in line to be president.
[00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:46.561]  This is the leader of the Democrat Party.
[00:04:47.582 --> 00:04:50.726]  And then they take that video and they say Trump doctored it.
[00:04:51.467 --> 00:04:53.409]  Can you believe the nerve of these people?
[00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:56.513]  Washington Post saying they doctored it to make Pelosi look bad.
[00:04:57.013 --> 00:04:58.735]  No, you just edit the clips together.
[00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:00.718]  It's a common tactic.
[00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:06.879]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.641]  That what God gave us from Mother Nature is incredible.
[00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:12.403]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[00:05:12.723 --> 00:05:13.924]  And the globalists are so upset.
[00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:17.527]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[00:05:18.783 --> 00:05:23.427]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[00:05:23.848 --> 00:05:24.688]  So we looked at that.
[00:05:24.829 --> 00:05:26.410]  We made the very best a.m.
[00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.830]  and p.m.
[00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:35.058]  packets out there with an incredible spectrum of 13 different capsules that you take in two servings a day that are game-changing a.m.
[00:05:35.178 --> 00:05:35.859]  and p.m.

[00:05:58.026 --> 00:06:03.229]  We looked at the best-selling products out there, and we made it even better, and we lowered the price.
[00:06:05.558 --> 00:06:07.059]  News out of Silicon Valley.
[00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:11.883]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[00:06:11.903 --> 00:06:15.566]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[00:06:15.606 --> 00:06:19.590]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.712]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[00:06:22.832 --> 00:06:29.938]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous.
[00:06:29.998 --> 00:06:30.558]  Dangerous.
[00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:31.159]  Dangerous.
[00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:31.659]  Dangerous.
[00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:32.280]  Dangerous.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.980]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:06:34.001 --> 00:06:35.121]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:37.322]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:40.503]  Basically they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[00:06:42.263 --> 00:06:43.344]  They call me dangerous.
[00:06:43.444 --> 00:06:44.844]  Danger is my middle name.
[00:06:45.064 --> 00:06:46.925]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[00:06:47.145 --> 00:06:50.386]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:55.108]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[00:06:55.188 --> 00:06:56.669]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[00:06:56.869 --> 00:07:01.370]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.971]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[00:07:04.172 --> 00:07:06.032]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:08.393]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:11.254]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[00:07:11.374 --> 00:07:12.395]  I want them shut down.
[00:07:12.455 --> 00:07:13.375]  I want them silenced.
[00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:14.116]  I want them muted.
[00:07:14.136 --> 00:07:16.076]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:17.457]  I want them shut down!
[00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.098]  I want them silenced!
[00:07:19.178 --> 00:07:19.939]  I want them muted!
[00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:23.342]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal few.
[00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:34.193]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content.
[00:07:34.213 --> 00:07:42.040]  And we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:47.263]  Through your rules, your rules go against our values, and they are patently un-American.
[00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:49.924]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[00:07:50.444 --> 00:07:54.426]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[00:07:54.646 --> 00:07:57.067]  We need a digital Bill of Rights.
[00:07:57.187 --> 00:08:00.848]  They're becoming the public square, and they control how we interact with each other.
[00:08:01.068 --> 00:08:08.111]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane, and you are part of the problem.
[00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:09.391]  You are a bad person.
[00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:10.792]  You should be censored off the internet.
[00:08:10.852 --> 00:08:11.492]  Bad, yes!
[00:08:12.032 --> 00:08:13.033]  Get out of here, Alex!
[00:08:13.293 --> 00:08:17.674]  InfoWars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[00:08:17.794 --> 00:08:26.597]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[00:08:26.897 --> 00:08:31.039]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.560]  Meanwhile, over there at CNN,
[00:08:37.128 --> 00:08:38.729]  Ratings are way down.
[00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:45.991]  As the InfoWars president tweets out, Wow, CNN ratings are way down.
[00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:47.392]  Record lows.
[00:08:48.212 --> 00:08:52.113]  People are getting tired of so many fake stories and anti-Trump lies.
[00:08:52.833 --> 00:09:04.197]  Chris Cuomo was rewarded for lowest morning ratings with a primetime spot, which is failing badly and not helping the dumbest man on television, Don Lamon.
[00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:06.218]  Savage.
[00:09:09.909 --> 00:09:12.450]  That wasn't all the president tweeted out last night.
[00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:21.295]  He also said, when is Twitter going to allow the very popular conservative voices that it has so viciously shut down back into the open?
[00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:23.616]  It is time.
[00:09:25.437 --> 00:09:33.361]  So as we begin the Alex Jones Show here today on this Friday, I've got great guests coming up.
[00:09:33.422 --> 00:09:36.023]  Dan Lyman in the second hour to talk about
[00:09:37.253 --> 00:09:40.074]  The May ouster and the Brexit vote.
[00:09:41.674 --> 00:09:53.077]  I've got Stephan Arneo from StephanArneo.com, HardTimeStrongMen.com joining me in the third hour to talk about the attack on men and toxic masculinity.
[00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:59.739]  And then Tom Pappert will be taking over in the fourth hour.
[00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:05.260]  Here is how, here is the message that needs to be conveyed
[00:10:06.658 --> 00:10:07.619]  To the audience today.
[00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:10.540]  And we'll get to all the news and video clips and guests and everything.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:18.584]  But... We're about... Three weeks away.
[00:10:19.684 --> 00:10:20.325]  Maybe two.
[00:10:22.966 --> 00:10:32.811]  Give or take, let's say, two to four weeks away from the 2020 presidential campaign cycle finally really hitting us.
[00:10:34.232 --> 00:10:34.492]  And then...
[00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:39.182]  Once August and September come around, it's full swing.
[00:10:42.063 --> 00:10:44.784]  You know, I've been noticing something lately.
[00:10:46.184 --> 00:10:47.004]  Just in general.
[00:10:47.925 --> 00:10:54.527]  It's been going on for a while, but you notice that people just walk around with their heads down.
[00:10:54.847 --> 00:10:55.327]  You notice that?
[00:10:56.206 --> 00:10:59.408]  They don't even look where they're going, where they're walking.
[00:10:59.468 --> 00:11:00.909]  They have no idea of their surroundings.
[00:11:00.929 --> 00:11:01.750]  It's really incredible.
[00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:11.937]  You'll see people fumble into stuff, stumble into things, walk in the wrong direction, get confused, almost walk into traffic, walk and almost get hit by an electric scooter.
[00:11:12.037 --> 00:11:16.620]  I mean, so people don't even look where they're going anymore.
[00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:25.006]  And the reason why I use this analogy is we need to have our heads up
[00:11:26.147 --> 00:11:28.128]  And on a swivel right now.
[00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:35.392]  Because you are a month away from the 2020 elections really getting going.
[00:11:37.393 --> 00:11:38.393]  And so what does that mean?
[00:11:39.113 --> 00:11:41.655]  That means you're going to see more domestic leftist hair.
[00:11:42.975 --> 00:11:47.538]  And it's going to get more organized and then more violent once we get closer to the election.
[00:11:47.718 --> 00:11:49.699]  And it's more obvious that the Democrats have nothing.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:52.200]  Once
[00:11:53.581 --> 00:12:04.168]  These intel agencies that put out the fake Russian collusion narrative and engaged in the illegal spying, once those investigations come out again before the election, the left is going to get wild.
[00:12:04.728 --> 00:12:07.930]  The Democrats are going to call for violence and insurrection in this country.
[00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:11.272]  You better have your head up.
[00:12:12.393 --> 00:12:15.115]  Americans better have their heads up.
[00:12:16.857 --> 00:12:19.399]  There is a national emergency.
[00:12:19.479 --> 00:12:20.800]  This is not a debate.
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.001]  It is a crisis.
[00:12:22.181 --> 00:12:23.742]  It is a humanitarian crisis.
[00:12:24.162 --> 00:12:26.764]  It is out of control what's happening at the southern border.
[00:12:29.506 --> 00:12:34.489]  And this is all going to come to a head in 2020.
[00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:38.152]  So you better have your head up.
[00:12:39.433 --> 00:12:40.934]  You better know where you're walking.
[00:12:42.135 --> 00:12:43.716]  And you better know your surroundings.
[00:12:44.674 --> 00:12:47.336]  Or you're going to get run over.
[00:12:51.018 --> 00:13:02.544]  Now, I also suspect we're about to see another wave of social media censorship within the next month.
[00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:14.171]  Because what's key is, again, the 2020 elections and they cannot have conservative voices and Trump supporters on social media.
[00:13:15.868 --> 00:13:22.670]  And so the Krasenstein brothers got kicked off, ironically, for using a bunch of bots.
[00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:42.837]  Now, I was discussing this with some people last night and the opinion of a lot of people, they're connected in DC and talk to these social media people, is that this is a head fake.
[00:13:44.537 --> 00:13:51.959]  They took down the Krasensteins so that they can now come after another wave of Trump supporters.
[00:13:53.139 --> 00:14:03.782]  And whether the Krasensteins were using bots, I mean, maybe they were, maybe they weren't, the narrative is important because that's the narrative they're going to use when they come after all these Trump supporters.
[00:14:04.382 --> 00:14:08.483]  Remember the old, uh, I'm not a hot Russian bot meme?
[00:14:09.063 --> 00:14:10.523]  They're going to come after it again.
[00:14:11.564 --> 00:14:12.484]  And they're gonna say bots.
[00:14:13.803 --> 00:14:23.708]  And they're gonna say, but we got the Krasensteins, we got, uh, we got Faircon, we got Havanetti, who's now facing up to, what, like 400 years in jail?
[00:14:24.028 --> 00:14:25.149]  Nice endorsement, Stelter.
[00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:33.453]  So... Enjoy this Memorial Day weekend.
[00:14:36.135 --> 00:14:36.855]  Enjoy the summer.
[00:14:38.676 --> 00:14:38.836]  But...
[00:14:39.594 --> 00:14:45.216]  You better have your head up as we go into 2020 because it is about to get wild.
[00:14:46.797 --> 00:14:49.798]  It is about to get wild.
[00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:51.879]  The censorship will increase.
[00:14:51.899 --> 00:15:00.623]  The illegal immigration pouring over the southern border is going to increase, which means the disease and the violence is going to increase.
[00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.972]  Leftist domestic terror is going to increase.
[00:15:04.912 --> 00:15:06.314]  The censorship is going to increase.
[00:15:07.134 --> 00:15:08.715]  It's all coming.
[00:15:08.936 --> 00:15:13.339]  The fake news, the attacks against Trump, the attacks against Trump supporters, it's all coming.
[00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:18.183]  And then also though, the investigations, the declassification.
[00:15:21.845 --> 00:15:22.686]  Better have your head up.
[00:15:24.327 --> 00:15:28.590]  If for nothing else, just to enjoy the show,
[00:15:30.834 --> 00:15:34.036]  That you're about to witness for about the next year and a half.
[00:15:35.777 --> 00:15:37.458]  You thought 2016 was crazy?
[00:15:39.319 --> 00:15:46.304]  Well it was, but it will pale in comparison to what we're going to witness over the next year and a half.
[00:15:46.524 --> 00:15:51.327]  Which will most likely inevitably end up with Trump being re-elected.
[00:15:52.088 --> 00:15:56.811]  Which will then again infuriate the left, causing them to go into more hysterics.
[00:15:57.671 --> 00:16:00.013]  Have your head up folks, it's about to get wild out there.
[00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:06.870]  The Global Controllers are very smart in some ways, very ignorant in others.
[00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.410]  But they understand the power of archetypes.
[00:16:10.651 --> 00:16:18.352]  And I never knew when I started out on my quest 25 years ago to restore the American Republic that I would end up being a major leader in it.
[00:16:18.972 --> 00:16:24.673]  I just simply thought I'd be one more voice calling on the people to stand up and get involved in their own destinies.
[00:16:26.514 --> 00:16:27.234]  But it became clear
[00:16:28.908 --> 00:16:35.293]  Eight, nine years ago, even in Newsweek and Time Magazine, they said, Alex Jones is the mad prophet of the Tea Party.
[00:16:36.094 --> 00:16:40.178]  In the wilderness, he must be stopped.
[00:16:40.238 --> 00:16:45.802]  And all these years later, I realized that I didn't invent the ideas I'm promoting.
[00:16:46.943 --> 00:16:55.451]  I'm simply promoting free market, Renaissance, Americana, and ideas that are
[00:16:57.125 --> 00:17:03.327]  Diametrically opposed to authoritarian systems, whether they be fascist, communist, or socialist.
[00:17:05.688 --> 00:17:14.612]  But nevertheless, Infowars has been chosen by the enemy as the symbol of Americana, as the card.
[00:17:15.752 --> 00:17:24.056]  And if they can demonize it, if they can lie about it, and if they can destroy it, they believe they can demoralize you and make you give up.
[00:17:24.776 --> 00:17:24.936]  So,
[00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:28.413]  Please hold InfoWars up.
[00:17:29.034 --> 00:17:29.835]  Please promote it.
[00:17:29.895 --> 00:17:30.596]  Please support it.
[00:17:31.457 --> 00:17:34.081]  I personally hope that we can survive this.
[00:17:35.383 --> 00:17:36.205]  But even if we don't...
[00:17:37.403 --> 00:17:47.626]  Don't think a defeat of an individual or an organization is an expression of who you are, because you are the listeners and viewers that actually made InfoWars the success it is.
[00:17:48.306 --> 00:18:01.050]  Yes, I selfishly want to continue on with the future, but I don't want you to ever think that if I'm set up, killed, destroyed, imprisoned, lied about with their fake narratives, that we're losers.
[00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.411]  We did the right thing and told the truth, and we've already changed the world.
[00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:06.792]  So you need to continue on.
[00:18:07.674 --> 00:18:08.795]  But we're at that fork in the road.
[00:18:09.416 --> 00:18:13.760]  Will InfoWars continue on to fight more battles and win more battles thanks to your support?
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.642]  Or will we be destroyed?
[00:18:16.202 --> 00:18:18.645]  And then you have to move on and not be demoralized.
[00:18:19.285 --> 00:18:19.866]  We're at that point.
[00:18:21.385 --> 00:18:22.065]  It's financial.
[00:18:22.546 --> 00:18:25.467]  At the end of the day, money talks, BS walks.
[00:18:26.207 --> 00:18:30.449]  Funding allows us to operate and expand and defeat the enemy.
[00:18:31.169 --> 00:18:33.911]  Not having money shuts us down and we're defeated.
[00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:37.052]  And once we've been silenced, the enemy can lie about us all they want.
[00:18:37.752 --> 00:18:41.094]  We're running Memorial Day specials right through next week.
[00:18:41.754 --> 00:18:43.115]  Some of the biggest sales we've ever done.
[00:18:43.135 --> 00:18:46.997]  60% off, extend-a-wise, for cardiovascular and heart.
[00:18:47.777 --> 00:18:48.938]  It's the best formula out there.
[00:18:49.819 --> 00:18:50.599]  MycoZX.
[00:18:50.719 --> 00:18:54.742]  Instead of just a probiotic, it's anti-fungus, anti-candida molds for your guts.
[00:18:55.062 --> 00:18:55.482]  Amazing.
[00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:56.523]  Try it for yourself.
[00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:57.584]  60% off.
[00:18:58.565 --> 00:19:05.810]  50% off our new 8-pack Power Stack Bodies Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Vitamin Refusion, Ultimate Bone Broth, Super Metal Vitality.
[00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.591]  That's 50% off.
[00:19:07.611 --> 00:19:09.072]  40% off Turbo Force back in stock.
[00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:14.215]  And the chocolate and vanilla protein bars are the best out there.
[00:19:14.536 --> 00:19:17.458]  There's a bunch of other specials as well, but we try to make it symbiotic.
[00:19:17.518 --> 00:19:21.720]  Great products at great prices that make your life better within funder operation.
[00:19:21.981 --> 00:19:25.203]  Whatever you do, commit now like you've already done.
[00:19:26.448 --> 00:19:32.174]  To take action, whether it's word of mouth, or praying for us, or buying the products, or all three, you've already changed the world.
[00:19:32.654 --> 00:19:47.069]  And I humbly come to you with respect, and thank you again for what you've done for myself, for my children, and for your children, and for all of our own destinies, because this is an incredible time in humanity at that fork in the road, or at that crossroads.
[00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:48.330]  But whatever you do,
[00:19:49.111 --> 00:19:50.252]  Never give in to the globalist.
[00:19:50.752 --> 00:19:52.112]  Never give in to your humanity.
[00:19:52.533 --> 00:19:53.853]  Never believe you're a piece of crap.
[00:19:54.353 --> 00:19:55.814]  Never believe that humanity sucks.
[00:19:56.294 --> 00:19:59.215]  Because that is a lie of the old serpent, Satan.
[00:20:06.018 --> 00:20:09.140]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:18.028 --> 00:20:18.469]  I'm good.
[00:20:31.204 --> 00:20:38.487]  This video is just for the Jews who don't like Tommy Robinson, and especially those Jews who say he's anti-Semitic.
[00:20:38.507 --> 00:20:44.990]  Because I hear it all the time, not just from fringe media, but from the mainstream and Jewish media as well.
[00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:49.792]  They call him a racist, a fascist, and often even a Nazi.
[00:20:50.812 --> 00:21:02.360]  Here in Australia, the chairman of the Australian Defamation Commission, Dvir Abramovich, was reported in news.com.au calling Tommy Robinson a white supremacist and anti-Semite.
[00:21:03.321 --> 00:21:05.282]  So, is it true?
[00:21:06.383 --> 00:21:10.025]  Well, first let's look at his close friends and work colleagues.
[00:21:11.206 --> 00:21:16.009]  We have Ezra Levan from Rebel Media, who has worked with Tommy for years now.
[00:21:16.289 --> 00:21:16.750]  Guess what?
[00:21:17.899 --> 00:21:18.400]  He's a Jew.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:24.966]  His current campaign manager for today's election is a Jew.
[00:21:25.767 --> 00:21:29.950]  Brian London, one of Tommy's closest friends for many years now, is a Jew.
[00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:34.154]  And myself, I am Australia's proudest Jew.
[00:21:35.155 --> 00:21:37.057]  That's just to give you, name a few, but...
[00:21:38.479 --> 00:21:43.364]  By the way, Drew from the ADC, he's never met Tommy in real life.
[00:21:43.845 --> 00:21:48.450]  He just likes to make headlines and I don't blame him because that was an easy opportunity.
[00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:53.776]  The fact is, Tommy Robinson is the furthest thing from a Nazi.
[00:21:54.237 --> 00:21:55.298]  Let me give you a couple of examples.
[00:21:55.898 --> 00:22:01.462]  In November 2016, Tommy travelled to Israel to witness the conflict for himself.
[00:22:02.002 --> 00:22:03.563]  He'd wanted to make this trip for ages.
[00:22:04.484 --> 00:22:11.229]  When he was there, he fell in love with the people, he fell in love with the land, and he declared himself publicly a Zionist.
[00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:18.613]  The trip confirmed to him what he already understood about the jihadi threat Israel faces on a daily basis.
[00:22:19.493 --> 00:22:21.955]  You often see Israeli flags at all these rallies.
[00:22:22.635 --> 00:22:26.256]  They were even present back in the EDL days, next to gay flags.
[00:22:27.177 --> 00:22:35.721]  Neither of those flags would be accepted at any real far-right event, which his followers and him himself love.
[00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.931]  The backlash from Jew haters has never bothered Tommy Robinson.
[00:22:40.111 --> 00:22:49.656]  The former leader of Britain's racist British National Party hates Tommy because of his love of Israel and because he doesn't have any problem with gay people.
[00:22:51.237 --> 00:22:57.780]  Whenever you read an article on Tommy, they generally describe him as the founder of the EDL, just to vilify him.
[00:22:58.812 --> 00:23:03.317]  But they never tell you why Tommy left the EDL, that he himself found it.
[00:23:04.198 --> 00:23:11.825]  And I will, because it's the perfect example of how not anti-Semitic Tommy really is.
[00:23:12.946 --> 00:23:18.992]  When Tommy was sent to prison, the EDL was hijacked by actual Jew haters, and Tommy wanted no part in it.
[00:23:19.873 --> 00:23:22.054]  He tried to push him out from within, but he couldn't.
[00:23:22.655 --> 00:23:25.296]  So he publicly walked away.
[00:23:26.217 --> 00:23:31.900]  Now just imagine how much easier would it have been for Tommy to embrace anti-Semitism at the time.
[00:23:32.521 --> 00:23:36.203]  But he didn't, because he's not what they call him.
[00:23:36.723 --> 00:23:38.004]  He's not an anti-Semite.
[00:23:38.805 --> 00:23:42.367]  He has always stood on principle, no matter the personal cost.
[00:23:42.607 --> 00:23:49.171]  And we know, boy, the personal cost has often been extremely, extremely high.
[00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:54.849]  The media also love to define Tommy as a violent, convicted criminal.
[00:23:55.249 --> 00:23:56.630]  Again, just smearing.
[00:23:57.731 --> 00:24:07.159]  But they don't tell you that Tommy has never, ever been charged with any race-related or hate-related crimes.
[00:24:07.859 --> 00:24:13.644]  Most of his criminal history has literally been trumped-up charges designed to silence him.
[00:24:14.064 --> 00:24:17.307]  He's still dealing with that type of persecution today.
[00:24:17.347 --> 00:24:19.829]  I was in court with him last week.
[00:24:21.232 --> 00:24:26.034]  When the media include the word violent in their description, they don't explain the charge.
[00:24:26.054 --> 00:24:27.574]  So let me tell you what really happened.
[00:24:28.814 --> 00:24:33.616]  At one of his rallies, a real, proud, Hitler-loving neo-Nazi attended.
[00:24:34.816 --> 00:24:39.798]  When Tommy saw the man in the crowd, he asked the scumbag to leave, as Tommy does.
[00:24:40.982 --> 00:24:43.983]  When he refused to leave, Tommy walked up to him and knocked him out.
[00:24:44.584 --> 00:24:59.169]  Now, I'm not going to sit here and condone violence, but as a Jew, when I hear about someone that not only stands with me in theory, and my people in theory, but when we're not even around, he will literally fight for us.
[00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.070]  It makes me feel protected.
[00:25:01.971 --> 00:25:02.571]  The truth is, if
[00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:11.855]  If you really want to understand how Tommy ever managed to be labelled an anti-Semite, look no further than the people who created that narrative.
[00:25:12.815 --> 00:25:21.060]  Far-left organisations often create narrative based on falsehoods to smear people of influence that don't share their outlook on life.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.221]  It doesn't only happen to Tommy.
[00:25:23.982 --> 00:25:27.524]  In fact, it happens to me all the time.
[00:25:28.444 --> 00:25:29.945]  Take a look at this site for example.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.072]  This so-called Jewish organisation published this article seven plus times.
[00:25:37.292 --> 00:25:39.958]  Avi Yamini consorted with Neo-Nazis.
[00:25:40.965 --> 00:25:43.446]  Now, the article is full of baseless lies.
[00:25:43.506 --> 00:25:46.647]  I've never even met most of the people listed here.
[00:25:47.367 --> 00:25:53.329]  And the ones I have are either not Nazis, for example, Milo, who also happens to be a Jew.
[00:25:53.989 --> 00:25:55.669]  Just the wrong type of Jew for them.
[00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:01.791]  Or it's just some random guy I didn't know who walked up to me, shook my hand, snap, they got a photo.
[00:26:02.692 --> 00:26:05.072]  And I would hardly call that consortium.
[00:26:06.073 --> 00:26:07.893]  In Australia, we have this custom.
[00:26:07.913 --> 00:26:10.474]  If someone walks up to you, puts out their hand, we shake.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:18.856]  But that doesn't stop the mainstream media from republishing those lies and spreading the fake news from that article.
[00:26:20.456 --> 00:26:27.918]  More irony for you, this same organisation, for example, and most of the organisations that create these narratives are anti-Israel.
[00:26:28.458 --> 00:26:33.079]  They're the kind of people that we call in our community as self-hating Jews.
[00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:44.562]  If you for a second believe I, or the many who volunteer to serve on the front line of the IDF in the Golani Brigades, is in any way associated to Nazis, well...
[00:26:45.462 --> 00:26:46.803]  You, my friend, are an idiot.
[00:26:47.564 --> 00:26:48.365]  Nazis hate me.
[00:26:48.765 --> 00:26:50.867]  Just go online and read what they write about me.
[00:26:51.667 --> 00:26:52.328]  And guess what?
[00:26:53.288 --> 00:26:54.589]  The same goes for Tommy.
[00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.372]  But Tommy doesn't have the same defence I have.
[00:26:57.452 --> 00:27:00.134]  He's not Jewish, and he never served in the IDF.
[00:27:01.595 --> 00:27:08.901]  But as one of my closest friends, I can promise you, Tommy is our most loyal ally.
[00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:18.222]  He is what literally stands between our community and the far left, the far right and Islamic extremists.
[00:27:19.002 --> 00:27:26.544]  He's put his life on the line to defend Britain and especially communities like ours from the real threats those three groups pose.
[00:27:28.085 --> 00:27:36.348]  Now he wants to defend us in the Jew-hating EU by serving in the European Parliament.
[00:27:37.628 --> 00:27:39.669]  So I'm asking you to put your trust in him.
[00:27:41.058 --> 00:27:42.360]  Give him your vote today.
[00:27:43.481 --> 00:27:51.452]  If all you know of the man is what you've read in the mainstream newspaper, well, I guess you now understand why people hate Israel so much.
[00:27:52.893 --> 00:27:59.382]  If I relied on the mainstream media to get my info on Israel, I too would hate her with all my heart.
[00:28:00.438 --> 00:28:01.359]  But we know better.
[00:28:01.859 --> 00:28:03.741]  We know better than to take their word for it.
[00:28:04.482 --> 00:28:07.925]  We know better than to believe their fake news when it comes to Israel.
[00:28:07.945 --> 00:28:15.451]  So I'm asking you to ignore the fake news, as you do with Israel, and instead believe one of his closest friends, a proud Jew.
[00:28:16.372 --> 00:28:23.138]  Make this lad, Moammar, truly rejoiceful by helping to elect a real defender of the Jewish people.
[00:28:24.459 --> 00:28:28.481]  Only two weeks ago, Tommy took me to a local restaurant in Manchester called Ta'am.
[00:28:29.042 --> 00:28:29.662]  Best food.
[00:28:30.202 --> 00:28:34.084]  So glad to see authentic Israeli food in Manchester.
[00:28:34.104 --> 00:28:39.387]  But what was really great to see there was how much the Frum community embraced him.
[00:28:39.427 --> 00:28:44.870]  When Tommy walked in there, every religious man with payas, tzitzis, came and shook his hand.
[00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:49.012]  Today, I'm going to ask all of you on Lag Bahama, please,
[00:28:49.759 --> 00:28:52.381]  Share this message with all your family and friends.
[00:28:52.441 --> 00:28:53.602]  Spread it around the community.
[00:28:54.383 --> 00:28:55.964]  Tell them not to waste their votes today.
[00:28:56.645 --> 00:28:59.127]  Tell them to vote Tommy Robinson.
[00:28:59.147 --> 00:29:00.248]  Hug some out.
[00:29:03.846 --> 00:29:10.512]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[00:29:11.253 --> 00:29:15.037]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[00:29:15.537 --> 00:29:19.240]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[00:29:24.912 --> 00:29:26.553]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[00:29:26.613 --> 00:29:27.574]  This is racketeering.
[00:29:27.834 --> 00:29:28.654]  This is cartels.
[00:29:28.955 --> 00:29:31.056]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[00:29:31.376 --> 00:29:32.717]  We need it now.
[00:29:33.237 --> 00:29:34.518]  You can take on Big Ten.
[00:29:34.938 --> 00:29:43.324]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[00:29:43.884 --> 00:29:51.689]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else, like Domino's, would fall.
[00:29:51.929 --> 00:29:52.790]  The way to fight back
[00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:58.140]  is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.028]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[00:30:03.123 --> 00:30:12.687]  Sometimes in life, your pipes just get a little clogged up, a little backed up, and you just can't get that clearance and that push that you need.
[00:30:13.287 --> 00:30:19.790]  But with Oxy-Powder from InfowarsStore.com, that will no longer be an issue.
[00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.751]  But watch out, because this stuff is powerful.

[00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:25.009]  You found it.
[00:33:25.369 --> 00:33:26.850]  The tip of the spear.
[00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:32.213]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:33:32.873 --> 00:33:33.434]  All right.
[00:33:34.674 --> 00:33:40.398]  President Trump has just done a brief statement to the press.
[00:33:41.836 --> 00:33:44.338]  On the White House lawn, I want to go to this now.
[00:33:44.758 --> 00:33:51.103]  There's a couple very important aspects to this, but I do want to say something because I'm getting a lot of complaints that we haven't mentioned Julian Assange.
[00:33:51.884 --> 00:33:54.826]  So, we'll go ahead and just do that right now.
[00:33:56.508 --> 00:34:05.495]  Julian Assange has been charged with 18 federal charges in a new indictment, violating the Espionage Act.
[00:34:06.535 --> 00:34:08.297]  This is a terrible attack on free speech.
[00:34:09.517 --> 00:34:11.678]  This is a terrible attack on the press.
[00:34:12.539 --> 00:34:25.346]  This is a terrible attack on truth, on journalism, and a shame, a shame on the federal government and the President of the United States if Julian Assange gets locked up and the key thrown away.
[00:34:25.386 --> 00:34:37.473]  They need to reach a deal with him, and I think there needs to be cooperation both ways, but Julian Assange does not deserve to rot in jail the rest of his life.
[00:34:37.633 --> 00:34:38.514]  Hillary Clinton does.
[00:34:40.003 --> 00:34:43.624]  So Hassan should not be punished for exposing the crimes of Hillary Clinton.
[00:34:45.485 --> 00:34:52.388]  But we'll talk about that later, maybe take some calls on that, but listen to what the President is going to say in this clip.
[00:34:53.468 --> 00:35:02.212]  There's actually, he says some good things and he says something that I'm not so happy about, but... Well, just take a listen for yourself.
[00:35:04.676 --> 00:35:05.796]  Very transparent.
[00:35:06.116 --> 00:35:10.857]  So as you know, I declassified everything, everything they want.
[00:35:11.477 --> 00:35:14.598]  I put it under the auspices of the Attorney General.
[00:35:14.638 --> 00:35:15.878]  He's going to be in charge of it.
[00:35:16.438 --> 00:35:19.579]  He's a great gentleman and a highly respected man.
[00:35:20.339 --> 00:35:29.841]  So everything that they need is declassified and they'll be able to see how this hoax, how the hoax or witch hunt started and why it started.
[00:35:30.781 --> 00:35:31.621]  It was a
[00:35:32.541 --> 00:35:34.522]  Now we'll get to what he's about to say after this.
[00:36:03.976 --> 00:36:06.457]  So here's what you're going to find out, and we already know it.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:17.044]  The Barack Obama administration was illegally spying on Donald Trump's campaign.
[00:36:19.605 --> 00:36:30.892]  They needed an excuse for the illegal spying when it became a reality that Trump might actually win and Hillary couldn't get in there to cover up their crimes, so they had to make up Russian collusion.
[00:36:32.699 --> 00:36:57.710]  They then colluded with British intelligence using Fusion GPS and Perkins Coie as the financial conduit for Hillary Clinton to make up false Russian intelligence known as the Trump dossier which was according to Steele and Mueller even
[00:37:00.219 --> 00:37:02.920]  Came from five Russian intelligence sources.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.821]  Now, whether you trust those Russian intelligence sources are irrelevant.
[00:37:07.162 --> 00:37:08.342]  There's your Russian collusion.
[00:37:08.702 --> 00:37:09.482]  But it's all fake.
[00:37:09.622 --> 00:37:10.623]  It's all manufactured.
[00:37:11.263 --> 00:37:15.224]  It was a cover-up of the illegal spy.
[00:37:17.685 --> 00:37:18.826]  And so it's all gonna come out.
[00:37:20.446 --> 00:37:21.387]  People are cooperating.
[00:37:23.227 --> 00:37:27.649]  And you're gonna find out that they used the dossier for the FISA warrants to illegally spy.
[00:37:29.645 --> 00:37:31.706]  And they knew it was bad intelligence.
[00:37:33.226 --> 00:37:49.550]  And that'll be the narrative which is kind of a softball because the real narrative is Barack Obama and his cohorts in the CIA, in the FBI, in the DOJ, probably in the NSA, maybe in the FISA courts, committed treason.
[00:37:53.211 --> 00:37:58.813]  Now Trump has alluded to this multiple times about the treason.
[00:38:02.762 --> 00:38:10.726]  The real question is, what are the American people going to do and think and say when all of this comes out?
[00:38:15.248 --> 00:38:24.452]  Because I don't think the President goes after Obama unless he knows the public has his back if he does so.
[00:38:26.493 --> 00:38:26.853]  But you know,
[00:38:30.936 --> 00:38:41.021]  Trump's biggest problem is he is one man against an entire infrastructure of corruption.
[00:38:44.663 --> 00:38:52.888]  One man against an entire infrastructure of corruption and treason.
[00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.491]  So that's good news for Americans.
[00:38:59.625 --> 00:39:01.685]  But it comes with the bad news on Assange.
[00:39:01.865 --> 00:39:12.147]  So, good news, we're going to get the declassification, we're going to see all the crimes of the Obama administration when it came to the illegal spying on Donald Trump and the treasonous coup that Obama and his cohorts engaged in.
[00:39:13.428 --> 00:39:19.609]  Bad news is, right now, Julian Assange, great journalist, is looking at life in jail.
[00:39:19.709 --> 00:39:24.470]  Now, let's go back to the President for what, in my mind, is more bad news.
[00:39:27.612 --> 00:39:28.872]  We want to have protection.
[00:39:29.092 --> 00:39:34.814]  The Middle East, we're going to be sending a relatively small number of troops, mostly protective.
[00:39:35.694 --> 00:39:39.955]  And some very talented people are going to the Middle East right now.
[00:39:40.415 --> 00:39:41.275]  And we'll see how.
[00:39:41.975 --> 00:39:43.115]  And we'll see what happens.
[00:39:46.876 --> 00:39:48.136]  So I think he's about to go on.
[00:39:49.877 --> 00:39:52.557]  So we're about to send thousands of troops to the Middle East.
[00:39:55.278 --> 00:39:55.858]  To what?
[00:39:57.346 --> 00:39:58.327]  Protect Israel.
[00:39:59.807 --> 00:40:02.669]  Puff our chest out against Iran and China.
[00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:05.691]  Because the military-industrial complex.
[00:40:05.731 --> 00:40:06.651]  Because we want to.
[00:40:06.732 --> 00:40:10.454]  Because we're getting ready to stage, or somebody's getting ready to stage a false flag in Syria.
[00:40:10.494 --> 00:40:12.395]  We need to have ground forces ready to invade.
[00:40:12.975 --> 00:40:13.435]  I don't know.
[00:40:13.676 --> 00:40:14.616]  None of it's good news.
[00:40:15.056 --> 00:40:19.119]  We have a damn invasion on our southern border right now.
[00:40:19.339 --> 00:40:20.300]  An invasion.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.641]  And we're sending troops to the Middle East?
[00:40:25.463 --> 00:40:25.943]  I'm sorry.
[00:40:28.083 --> 00:40:31.024]  I'm sorry, that's not a priority right now.
[00:40:34.726 --> 00:40:37.808]  That's not why we elected Trump.
[00:40:39.128 --> 00:40:54.336]  But again, this is one man going against an entire infrastructure of corruption that has been growing and metastasizing for decades.
[00:40:55.397 --> 00:40:56.037]  Decades.
[00:40:58.434 --> 00:41:01.796]  And you can tell, the President's picking and choosing his battles.
[00:41:03.897 --> 00:41:05.658]  Said he wanted to get all the troops out of the Middle East.
[00:41:06.759 --> 00:41:08.860]  Well, hasn't really gone so smoothly.
[00:41:09.861 --> 00:41:12.942]  And he even had to call out the military and industrial complex on air.
[00:41:12.982 --> 00:41:13.843]  So just get ready.
[00:41:13.863 --> 00:41:16.624]  In the next week or two, you'll have more troops over there.
[00:41:16.684 --> 00:41:19.086]  They'll fire off a couple billion dollars worth of rockets.
[00:41:19.626 --> 00:41:21.227]  Weapons manufacturers will get rich.
[00:41:21.567 --> 00:41:22.608]  Wall Street will get rich.
[00:41:22.988 --> 00:41:24.729]  Military-industrial complex rolls on.
[00:41:27.338 --> 00:41:33.461]  That's how the story goes in the Big Game of War.
[00:41:34.842 --> 00:41:35.883]  A World Racket.
[00:41:38.764 --> 00:41:39.645]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:41.386 --> 00:41:42.446]  We're going to take a break here.
[00:41:42.927 --> 00:41:46.229]  In this four-minute break, please go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:41:46.249 --> 00:41:50.951]  Now, you may notice that Alex is not with us today, and he will be back next week.
[00:41:50.971 --> 00:41:53.833]  We may be hearing from him, but do me a favor.
[00:41:56.178 --> 00:42:01.699]  In this short break, let's send a message to Alex Jones.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:13.262]  Let's send a message to Alex Jones by going to Infowarsstore.com and just committing to buying the super blue fluoride free toothpaste.
[00:42:13.462 --> 00:42:14.362]  Put it on auto ship.
[00:42:14.762 --> 00:42:18.483]  If you do it every 60 days, it comes out to like five bucks a month.
[00:42:19.758 --> 00:42:24.243]  So you're paying five bucks a month, you get toothpaste all the time from InfoWareStore.com.
[00:42:24.683 --> 00:42:35.715]  It's great toothpaste, you support what we do here, and maybe Alex can quit pulling his hair out around here when it comes to making sure we're financially ready to expand.
[00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:41.631]  So just do me a favor here, as Alex is off today, and I'm honored to be filling in.
[00:42:42.552 --> 00:42:50.174]  Show Alex your appreciation for everything he's done with InfoWars, and instead of buying jets and exotic cars, he built this platform.
[00:42:50.814 --> 00:42:55.516]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, sign up for AutoShip for the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste.
[00:42:55.556 --> 00:42:57.016]  Get it shipped to you every 60 days.
[00:42:57.036 --> 00:42:58.617]  It'll come out to about five bucks a month.
[00:42:58.977 --> 00:43:01.418]  It's a total win-win, and you support the InfoWar.
[00:43:02.758 --> 00:43:05.259]  Remember just...
[00:43:06.832 --> 00:43:20.176]  Four or five years ago, they would have articles in the New York Times, the Washington Post, saying that globalists didn't exist, and that no one wanted global government.
[00:43:20.276 --> 00:43:34.740]  Well, as soon as Hillary lost, they came out and said, okay, global government's real, globalists are real, but they're the good guys, and everyone against globalism is a white supremacist.
[00:43:38.479 --> 00:43:40.621]  You know where globalism came from?
[00:43:43.823 --> 00:43:46.385]  It came from the Nazis.
[00:43:48.046 --> 00:43:50.448]  They wanted a system to counter the British Empire.
[00:43:51.469 --> 00:43:55.532]  That was the global power at that time.
[00:43:55.812 --> 00:44:00.195]  The old saying was, the sun never set on the British Empire.
[00:44:00.695 --> 00:44:02.316]  And Hitler gave speeches.
[00:44:02.617 --> 00:44:03.958]  Hitler wrote articles.
[00:44:04.018 --> 00:44:05.339]  It was all over the news at the time.
[00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:15.429]  That he wanted a European Union that would then dominate the globe in a form of globalism.
[00:44:16.209 --> 00:44:18.691]  So the term globalism actually comes from the Nazis.
[00:44:19.271 --> 00:44:24.474]  The modern Olympics symbols, the VW, the highways, NASA.
[00:44:24.794 --> 00:44:28.196]  I mean, they definitely innovated some stuff in their power grant.
[00:44:30.165 --> 00:44:32.746]  And I'm not saying this is a German or Nazi conspiracy.
[00:44:32.786 --> 00:44:34.526]  Hell, I'm half German myself.
[00:44:34.646 --> 00:44:35.466]  Germans are great people.
[00:44:36.246 --> 00:44:42.228]  But when harnessed by evil, good people can be like horses drawing the devil's carriage.
[00:44:43.588 --> 00:44:53.090]  And so ideas of the Nazis and ideas of the British Empire competed with each other, and big corporations picked up those ideas, and that's modern globalism.
[00:44:54.477 --> 00:45:01.561]  So InfoWars is seen as the most pure strain of Americana by the globalists.
[00:45:02.381 --> 00:45:12.067]  I've talked to top people in Hollywood, in entertainment, and in media, and in government, and they've said, Jones, you're seen as Americana.
[00:45:12.847 --> 00:45:23.733]  But they say, as beautiful as Americana is, and I'm not saying I'm beautiful, but Americana's beautiful, it stands in the way of the larger ideas of the planet and a one world government system.
[00:45:25.236 --> 00:45:32.059]  Well, humans are revolting against that one world government system, and are saying they don't want to be under its hegemonic control.
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:37.142]  Their great truth that they're so sure is, for us, isn't for us.
[00:45:37.162 --> 00:45:42.164]  In different countries and parts of the world, we don't want to be under their control.
[00:45:42.204 --> 00:45:44.125]  We don't want to carry out their vision.
[00:45:44.685 --> 00:45:46.826]  We want to live our own lives.
[00:45:47.046 --> 00:45:51.709]  And that's what Infowars represents, and that's why they've set up a system to demonize us.
[00:45:52.861 --> 00:45:54.402]  They've set up a system to lie about us.
[00:45:55.142 --> 00:45:58.624]  They've set up a system to create this strawman of who we are.
[00:45:58.645 --> 00:46:06.369]  Because they understand that people don't do things for money or power at the end of the day.
[00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:09.011]  They do it because of narratives.
[00:46:09.431 --> 00:46:10.592]  They do it because of culture.
[00:46:10.892 --> 00:46:13.934]  They do it because of ethos and what they stand for.
[00:46:16.635 --> 00:46:20.738]  Oh, some people may sell out for money, but people that really count do it for ideology.
[00:46:21.892 --> 00:46:26.336]  And the system knows that I'm trying to reboot, that you're trying to reboot.
[00:46:27.598 --> 00:46:30.420]  A system that competes with the British Empire.
[00:46:30.681 --> 00:46:33.443]  The British Empire called it the American system 200 years ago.
[00:46:33.684 --> 00:46:37.227]  They said our system of empire will fail in competition with this.
[00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:38.969]  Hitler said the same thing.
[00:46:40.168 --> 00:46:43.031]  The truth is our system was the best and the greatest because it empowered individuals.
[00:46:43.812 --> 00:46:48.076]  And now it's fighting the very same systems of tyranny today.
[00:46:48.697 --> 00:46:50.118]  Join us at InfoWars.com.
[00:46:50.478 --> 00:46:57.065]  Join the human community and spread the word against the censorship and know we will prevail as we've done in the past.
[00:46:57.525 --> 00:47:01.670]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:47:06.619 --> 00:47:09.244]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:37.622 --> 00:47:42.086]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:44.527]  There's so much to get to I don't even know where to begin.
[00:47:44.687 --> 00:47:45.868]  There's more video clips.
[00:47:47.229 --> 00:47:50.992]  But let me just get into some news here.
[00:47:51.012 --> 00:47:53.214]  I'm just gonna pick a stack and I'm just gonna dive in.
[00:47:54.675 --> 00:47:57.617]  Look at the total hypocrisy right now of the Democrat Party.
[00:47:57.657 --> 00:47:59.979]  I mean this is unbelievable.
[00:47:59.999 --> 00:48:01.140]  This comes from Adam Schiff.
[00:48:03.359 --> 00:48:11.562]  He tweets out, while Trump stonewalls the public from learning the truth about his obstruction of justice, he literally just announced he's going to declassify everything, you pencil-necked freak.
[00:48:12.322 --> 00:48:17.143]  Trump and Barr conspired to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies.
[00:48:17.324 --> 00:48:22.585]  Now, do you realize the hyperbole here?
[00:48:24.746 --> 00:48:31.028]  That is quite literally what Obama did, and it's all on record.
[00:48:33.186 --> 00:48:36.288]  He says the cover-ups have entered a new dangerous phase.
[00:48:36.308 --> 00:48:36.968]  This is un-American.
[00:48:37.408 --> 00:48:38.509]  So here's Adam Schiff.
[00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:39.550]  He knows damn well.
[00:48:45.153 --> 00:48:45.473]  Man.
[00:48:47.935 --> 00:48:52.337]  I just remember a little tweet from Donald Trump about Adam Schiff.
[00:48:53.398 --> 00:48:54.919]  About little Adam Schiff.
[00:48:57.659 --> 00:49:03.342]  How can Adam Schiff be such a corrupt, lying dirtbag?
[00:49:04.742 --> 00:49:12.686]  How can somebody be projecting in such an extreme manner?
[00:49:14.427 --> 00:49:15.788]  What's in Adam Schiff's closet?
[00:49:18.469 --> 00:49:20.350]  What does Adam Schiff do behind closed doors?
[00:49:21.851 --> 00:49:24.552]  Who does Adam Schiff like to hang out with in Hollywood?
[00:49:26.373 --> 00:49:26.473]  Hmm.
[00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:29.439]  Mm-hmm.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:38.421]  So here you have Obama and his cohorts caught red-handed conspiring to weaponize law enforcement.
[00:49:38.481 --> 00:49:42.442]  It's all about to be declassified and Adam Schiff says that it's Trump and Barr that did it.
[00:49:46.803 --> 00:49:50.263]  What does Adam Schiff do behind closed doors, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:49:51.183 --> 00:49:53.884]  That he has to be such a bold-faced liar.
[00:49:55.629 --> 00:49:58.173]  Because he's so afraid that he may be discovered.
[00:49:59.356 --> 00:50:04.004]  Little Adam Schiff.
[00:50:04.024 --> 00:50:06.748]  So, you've been seeing the Trump and Pelosi spat.
[00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.770]  In fact...
[00:50:08.663 --> 00:50:09.744]  Let's go to some of these videos.
[00:50:10.705 --> 00:50:13.427]  Trump-Pelosi trade insults as their feud heats up.
[00:50:14.088 --> 00:50:20.253]  Washington Post says, faked Pelosi videos slowed to make her appear drunk spread across social media.
[00:50:20.273 --> 00:50:21.774]  Uh, no.
[00:50:21.794 --> 00:50:21.834]  No.
[00:50:22.054 --> 00:50:28.420]  People edit the videos and then just compilation style put it together.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:31.142]  That's not doctoring the videos.
[00:50:31.182 --> 00:50:32.523]  Nobody's slowing anything down.
[00:50:33.344 --> 00:50:36.566]  And quite frankly, I hope Pelosi's drunk.
[00:50:37.415 --> 00:50:42.657]  NBC News, in latest attack, Trump tweets edited video of Pelosi tripping over words.
[00:50:42.817 --> 00:50:43.777]  No, it's not edited.
[00:50:43.957 --> 00:50:45.057]  It's the real video.
[00:50:45.417 --> 00:50:46.858]  They just take out clips.
[00:50:48.438 --> 00:50:50.359]  So this is the deception that they engage in.
[00:50:51.559 --> 00:51:02.903]  So here's Nancy Pelosi, who is either, you know, how far into dementia or Alzheimer's or whatever is she suffering from, or she's just a flat-out drunk.
[00:51:02.923 --> 00:51:06.464]  I mean, take your pick.
[00:51:08.476 --> 00:51:16.201]  And then you have President Trump, who's clearly with it, drug-free, never had a drop of alcohol, and they're gonna sit here and point the finger at him?
[00:51:16.461 --> 00:51:18.723]  A bunch of pill-popping drug addicts?
[00:51:23.326 --> 00:51:28.710]  You know, I was actually really... I'm actually really proud of two young conservatives right now.
[00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:32.192]  One of them works for us, Caitlin Bennett.
[00:51:32.813 --> 00:51:33.933]  Drug-free her whole life.
[00:51:34.394 --> 00:51:34.574]  She's...
[00:51:36.128 --> 00:51:36.529]  23 years old.
[00:51:37.509 --> 00:51:37.850]  C.J.
[00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:38.310]  Pearson.
[00:51:39.331 --> 00:51:44.675]  Young conservative from, I think he's from Georgia or Alabama, somewhere in the South.
[00:51:44.795 --> 00:51:45.576]  Maybe Louisiana.
[00:51:45.596 --> 00:51:48.118]  I believe he's 17, 18 years old.
[00:51:48.518 --> 00:51:49.019]  Drug free.
[00:51:49.799 --> 00:51:50.440]  Smart as a whip.
[00:51:52.101 --> 00:51:57.745]  There isn't a damn Democrat in this Congress or a damn Democrat voter, I bet you they could say that.
[00:51:59.327 --> 00:52:00.107]  I know I couldn't say it.
[00:52:00.848 --> 00:52:03.150]  Hell, I probably couldn't have said it when I was 16 years old.
[00:52:04.616 --> 00:52:07.357]  But you notice that we don't, we don't uplift those people.
[00:52:07.617 --> 00:52:08.437]  Who do we uplift?
[00:52:08.697 --> 00:52:10.078]  We uplift the drug addicts.
[00:52:10.318 --> 00:52:11.658]  We uplift the alcoholics.
[00:52:11.858 --> 00:52:13.439]  We uplift the degenerative behavior.
[00:52:13.619 --> 00:52:19.000]  But if you're an actual solid human being with a good foundation that's drug-free, eh.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.441]  People make fun of you for that.
[00:52:21.541 --> 00:52:22.421]  You're a square.
[00:52:23.881 --> 00:52:32.084]  But getting back to the important matters, the fact that they sit here and they point the finger at Trump for being mentally unstable is so laughable.
[00:52:34.437 --> 00:52:46.380]  The average American is in a trance, not paying attention, has no idea, totally deceived by the media, and so they actually see this and they're like, oh, Trump's doctoring video to make Pelosi look bad.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:47.940]  Oh my gosh, how dare he?
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:53.302]  No, Pelosi needs to be removed from office.
[00:52:53.482 --> 00:52:57.143]  She's either dead drunk or suffering from dementia.
[00:52:57.163 --> 00:52:58.103]  This is not a joke!
[00:52:59.278 --> 00:53:00.039]  This is not a joke!
[00:53:00.439 --> 00:53:02.001]  In fact, let's go to the video clips.
[00:53:02.121 --> 00:53:05.845]  First, let's go to Trump in clip 8.
[00:53:08.087 --> 00:53:10.289]  Again, this is just calling it like it is, folks.
[00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:13.613]  Nancy Pelosi is disintegrating before our eyes.
[00:53:14.804 --> 00:53:19.768]  Well, they're being very nice to her because they really, you know, she's a mess.
[00:53:19.828 --> 00:53:22.410]  Look, let's face it, she doesn't understand it.
[00:53:35.181 --> 00:53:37.983]  And they sort of feel she's disintegrating before the rush.
[00:53:38.023 --> 00:53:39.084]  She does not understand it.
[00:53:39.124 --> 00:53:42.446]  They want to have her understand it before we... It's finished.
[00:53:42.546 --> 00:53:43.027]  It's signed.
[00:53:43.087 --> 00:53:45.508]  As you know, Mexico's approved the deal.
[00:53:45.949 --> 00:53:47.190]  Canada's approved the deal.
[00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:51.412]  And they're waiting to get a signal for her.
[00:53:52.273 --> 00:53:56.817]  Now I would say this, the farmers should start talking to the Democrats in the House.
[00:53:56.997 --> 00:54:01.982]  The Senate's ready to approve it, the Republican Senate, but the Democrat House is not.
[00:54:02.682 --> 00:54:04.424]  Pelosi does not understand the bill.
[00:54:04.584 --> 00:54:05.625]  She doesn't understand it.
[00:54:05.765 --> 00:54:10.669]  Even though unions are in favor of it, farmers, manufacturers, everybody just about is in favor of it.
[00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:14.673]  It's a replacement for, as I said, the worst trade deal ever made.
[00:54:15.333 --> 00:54:17.655]  So she's got to get up to snuff, learn the bill,
[00:54:18.835 --> 00:54:20.636]  And by the way, I think she wants to approve it.
[00:54:20.956 --> 00:54:21.236]  I think.
[00:54:22.017 --> 00:54:28.099]  But so Bob Lighthizer, who you can speak to if you want, he's waiting to get the okay from her to send it in.
[00:54:28.139 --> 00:54:30.740]  So, he goes on and talks about this.
[00:54:31.281 --> 00:54:36.803]  One of the great crew here makes a joke, says the video of Nancy Pelosi isn't doctored, she needs a doctor.
[00:54:37.183 --> 00:54:38.224]  No, look, here's the deal.
[00:54:39.616 --> 00:54:41.457]  I mean, she's in the political arena.
[00:54:41.617 --> 00:54:42.077]  I feel bad.
[00:54:42.358 --> 00:54:44.299]  She's, what, like 79 or something.
[00:54:44.419 --> 00:54:45.559]  She's clearly losing it.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:51.703]  Every press conference and speech she gives now, she's slowly and slowly disintegrating before our eyes, as Trump said.
[00:54:52.183 --> 00:54:53.364]  She's whacked out.
[00:54:54.205 --> 00:54:55.325]  I want to know what her deal is.
[00:54:55.425 --> 00:54:57.066]  I want to know, what drugs is she on?
[00:54:57.787 --> 00:54:59.588]  She's clearly on some pharmaceutical drugs.
[00:54:59.948 --> 00:55:01.529]  Or is she just dead drunk all the time?
[00:55:02.813 --> 00:55:05.415]  And I don't care, I mean, you can be dead drunk and be a congressman, fine.
[00:55:05.875 --> 00:55:08.237]  You can do cocaine all day and be a congressman.
[00:55:08.437 --> 00:55:09.397]  Honestly, I don't care!
[00:55:09.417 --> 00:55:15.381]  If people want to vote a meth head in, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, if people want to vote a meth head in, then they can do that!
[00:55:17.322 --> 00:55:17.763]  But you see...
[00:55:19.022 --> 00:55:21.103]  They make Trump release his physicals.
[00:55:21.383 --> 00:55:23.764]  They make Trump's doctor put out a national statement.
[00:55:23.964 --> 00:55:25.785]  They attack Trump for his mental health.
[00:55:25.985 --> 00:55:27.306]  They say Trump's unstable.
[00:55:27.566 --> 00:55:28.627]  And then what do they give you?
[00:55:29.207 --> 00:55:38.051]  Bumbling, fumbling, can't-keep-her-dentures-in-her-mouth, can't-keep-her-eyes-open, can't-count-to-three, can't-even-remember-who-the-president-is, Nancy Pelosi.
[00:55:47.176 --> 00:55:47.496]  You know,
[00:55:49.022 --> 00:55:59.448]  They believe that the first wave of AI robots are going to be used to help elderly people in homes?
[00:56:01.489 --> 00:56:01.809]  Mm-hmm.
[00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:05.171]  Nancy, I think it's time.
[00:56:07.653 --> 00:56:08.573]  I think it's time, Nancy.
[00:56:09.154 --> 00:56:16.278]  But here's Nancy, either clearly drunk or whacked out of her head on pills because she's suffering from dementia.
[00:56:18.365 --> 00:56:21.247]  And nobody is going to call her on this except the President?
[00:56:21.868 --> 00:56:23.269]  The media is not going to call her on this?
[00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:28.393]  The Democrats aren't going to look at her and say that's the leader of the Democrat Party?
[00:56:29.974 --> 00:56:31.275]  One flew over the cuckoo's nest?
[00:56:34.398 --> 00:56:36.700]  In fact, I'll make a prediction right now.
[00:56:40.083 --> 00:56:47.749]  There's going to be a moment where Nancy Pelosi is in a press conference or something and she's going to just totally fall apart.
[00:56:49.036 --> 00:56:51.458]  Now, I don't know what that means, because she was on the verge yesterday.
[00:56:51.538 --> 00:56:55.161]  I mean, she was bumbling, fumbling.
[00:56:55.181 --> 00:56:57.082]  I mean, couldn't count to three.
[00:56:57.903 --> 00:57:00.665]  Halfway walked off the stage and then started, like, rambling.
[00:57:00.685 --> 00:57:05.128]  I mean, these are the ramblings of a drunken old haggard.
[00:57:10.552 --> 00:57:12.313]  It's just ridiculous that this is what we deal with.
[00:57:12.333 --> 00:57:13.354]  All right.
[00:57:14.015 --> 00:57:16.717]  Now, on the other side, in the second hour, Dan Lyman is going to be joining me.
[00:57:16.737 --> 00:57:17.857]  We're going to be discussing
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:24.570]  The Brexit vote that just happened and the ouster of Theresa May in the UK.
[00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:27.394]  Folks, please go to Infowarsstore.com this break.
[00:57:27.414 --> 00:57:28.316]  I barely even plugged this hour.
[00:57:28.336 --> 00:57:29.878]  We need your support at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:41.784]  They're gonna have a big wave of censorship, folks, and InfoWars platform is gonna be even more important so that voices can come on here and have free speech.
[00:57:41.984 --> 00:57:48.346]  So please support InfoWars, support free speech, go to InfoWarsStore.com, take advantage of the massive Memorial Day sale.
[00:57:48.606 --> 00:57:50.647]  You won't believe these savings at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:52.807 --> 00:57:56.489]  InfoWars.
[00:57:59.656 --> 00:58:02.358]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.781]  This is CNN.
[00:58:08.502 --> 00:58:12.785]  You see Apple making these decisions, you know, based on, you know, if this is impacting us.
[00:58:13.225 --> 00:58:18.929]  Do you think that tech companies are in a position right now where they can self-regulate with some of these more sticky issues?
[00:58:20.251 --> 00:58:21.273]  Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[00:58:21.493 --> 00:58:26.200]  I run the richest company in the world, and I pay Chinese slave laborers, you know, a dollar a day.
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:33.470]  I've moved Apple to China and given your iCloud keys to their government, and now I'm bringing Chinese censorship here to America and working with Google to do it.
[00:58:33.571 --> 00:58:34.752]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:58:35.876 --> 00:58:50.382]  Do you think, I mean it's interesting to hear you say that, I, just having covered a lot of this over the last months, I keep coming back to this fundamental question, and you can tell me if this is too philosophical for you, but I come back to this fundamental question, do we as users just have to re-envision the idea of privacy?
[00:58:50.462 --> 00:58:51.843]  Is it a luxury at this point?
[00:58:52.043 --> 00:58:53.083]  Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[00:58:53.403 --> 00:58:56.465]  The New York Times says, quote, I lead the moral high ground.
[00:58:56.525 --> 00:58:59.566]  That Apple, via Tim Cook, leads the moral high ground.
[00:59:00.575 --> 00:59:07.277]  So, our company pays zero taxes in China, and we run slave factories, but I'm helping shut down free speech in America.
[00:59:07.578 --> 00:59:09.458]  That makes me liberal.
[00:59:09.878 --> 00:59:19.342]  One of the interesting points today, and I know this is an issue near and dear to you and to Apple, you guys created a pride feature for Apple Watch.
[00:59:19.922 --> 00:59:28.065]  You know, just this morning the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to bake a cake in celebration of a same-sex couple.
[00:59:29.265 --> 00:59:36.291]  As a leader in the community, as Apple has, you know, continuously stood in front of LGBTQ rights, what's your reaction?
[00:59:36.311 --> 00:59:37.652]  Hi, I'm Tim Cook.
[00:59:37.893 --> 00:59:44.098]  I'm gay, but I don't say a word to China, even though I'm the biggest company in China, about how they execute gays.
[00:59:57.142 --> 01:00:03.904]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:06.945 --> 01:00:12.107]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Owen Schroer.
[01:00:12.447 --> 01:00:15.248]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.268 --> 01:00:21.910]  Alright, Dan Lyman is about to join me.
[01:00:26.058 --> 01:00:30.159]  To talk about the Brexit, the Theresa May ouster.
[01:00:30.319 --> 01:00:33.680]  But first, Theresa May gave her resignation speech.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.240]  I believe, yes, it's June 7th is the final day.
[01:00:37.061 --> 01:00:41.722]  And, well, it wasn't too pretty for Theresa May today.
[01:00:41.782 --> 01:00:43.342]  Here is that clip of her resigning.
[01:00:46.683 --> 01:00:50.744]  I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honor of my life to hold.
[01:00:52.503 --> 01:00:56.806]  The second female Prime Minister, but certainly not the last.
[01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:08.415]  I do so with no ill will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.
[01:01:11.577 --> 01:01:13.479]  She starts crying and walks off.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:14.840]  Yeah.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.801]  Well, a Prime Minister...
[01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:31.645]  Actually a lot of people are saying that the reason why she stepped down is because the MI6 and MI5 involvement in the fake Russian collusion narrative is about to come out and she just doesn't want to be around.
[01:01:32.626 --> 01:01:35.048]  So they kind of just shuffled her aside.
[01:01:35.068 --> 01:01:38.291]  So there she goes.
[01:01:38.972 --> 01:01:41.955]  She didn't do one of those awkward dance moves off the stage though.
[01:01:42.895 --> 01:01:43.475]  That's too bad.
[01:01:43.515 --> 01:01:50.299]  We could have used one of the worst dance moves in the history of humanity one more time before she finally resigned.
[01:01:50.319 --> 01:01:53.501]  But that Skeletor creature finally ousted.
[01:01:53.982 --> 01:01:55.122]  I guess will be June 7th.
[01:01:55.142 --> 01:01:56.963]  So what damage will she cause in the next two weeks?
[01:01:56.983 --> 01:01:57.564]  We'll find out.
[01:01:58.164 --> 01:02:02.707]  Here is Nigel Farage responding to the results of the vote.
[01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:11.860]  She said she would step aside as leader of the Conservative Party June the 7th, but remain as Prime Minister until a successor is chosen.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:14.543]  Joining us now on the phone, Nigel Farage.
[01:02:14.983 --> 01:02:18.988]  Right, Nigel, Brexit has taken out two Prime Ministers.
[01:02:19.548 --> 01:02:20.570]  How many more do you think?
[01:02:21.707 --> 01:02:22.927]  Well, that's a very good question.
[01:02:22.987 --> 01:02:29.089]  And don't forget, we're going to get on Sunday night, we will get the results of the European elections that were contested yesterday.
[01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:37.511]  And the polls are showing that the Conservative Party under Theresa May will not even achieve 10% in those elections.
[01:02:38.652 --> 01:02:42.973]  Whereas the Brexit Party, which I set up six weeks ago today, is projected to get 35%.
[01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:45.994]  So you can see that in their millions,
[01:02:46.674 --> 01:02:48.615]  Voters have deserted the Conservative Party.
[01:02:48.635 --> 01:02:51.857]  They've come to my new vehicle because they want Brexit delivered.
[01:02:52.017 --> 01:02:54.258]  So this then poses a very big question.
[01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:56.979]  What ticket does Boris Johnson run on?
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:03.202]  Is he going to be clear, unequivocal about the fact we absolutely have to leave the EU this year?
[01:03:03.923 --> 01:03:08.705]  If he is, then well, maybe there's someone there that we can talk to and perhaps do business with.
[01:03:09.165 --> 01:03:15.389]  If not, I think you could be witnessing the death of a political party that has dominated the UK for over 200 years.
[01:03:16.529 --> 01:03:18.090]  All right, Nigel, we'll leave it at that.
[01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:22.032]  Good luck in the elections, which are still taking place for the European Parliament.
[01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:25.975]  Get back to us soon about those results, Nigel, and we will talk to you later.
[01:03:25.995 --> 01:03:26.215]  I sure will.
[01:03:26.515 --> 01:03:26.875]  Thanks, Nigel.
[01:03:26.895 --> 01:03:27.175]  Thank you.
[01:03:27.215 --> 01:03:27.676]  See you soon.
[01:03:27.856 --> 01:03:28.116]  Bye.
[01:03:28.236 --> 01:03:42.244]  So this is the just absolute rejection of globalism worldwide, but you have to understand, if or when Britain leaves the EU, the EU is pretty much done.
[01:03:43.325 --> 01:03:45.326]  Because everybody's going to want to pull out of the EU after that.
[01:03:47.188 --> 01:03:57.832]  Italy will want to pull out, Spain will want to pull out, and it'll just go on and on and on until you have nobody left but like Brussels and Germany.
[01:04:01.233 --> 01:04:03.614]  And that's why they can't have it.
[01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:10.976]  Because the EU was the foundation of globalism by design.
[01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:16.298]  You bring in the EU, you use it as an example for the West,
[01:04:18.339 --> 01:04:35.294]  To take nation-states sovereignty and take it from them as nation-states and then give it to the larger body of a one-government system in control of all the nation-states.
[01:04:37.836 --> 01:04:43.642]  But you see, as soon as you vote to get out of that and people see it, they're gonna want out too.
[01:04:46.295 --> 01:04:48.718]  That's why they haven't let Britain leave.
[01:04:51.261 --> 01:04:59.931]  But if Britain leaves the EU, the EU will be dead within 10 years, because nobody else will want to stay.
[01:05:07.367 --> 01:05:10.429]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.

[01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:17.226]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:17.566 --> 01:06:20.788]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:31.735 --> 01:06:38.180]  Folks, we expanded InfoWars with EuropeWars.com, Dan Lyman at the helm,
[01:06:40.292 --> 01:06:41.693]  Over a year ago now, I believe.
[01:06:43.234 --> 01:06:48.858]  And that's what we do here at InfoWars with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:49.178 --> 01:06:51.480]  You know, Alex Jones doesn't buy private jets.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.301]  He flies commercial.
[01:06:53.921 --> 01:06:56.643]  Alex Jones doesn't have a bunch of exotic cars.
[01:06:56.924 --> 01:06:58.305]  He has some American-made cars.
[01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:04.246]  And Alex Jones doesn't line his pockets with all the money that you flood us with.
[01:07:04.746 --> 01:07:07.046]  He builds the InfoWars platform.
[01:07:07.267 --> 01:07:08.567]  He hires Dan Lyman.
[01:07:08.847 --> 01:07:10.407]  He expands to InfoWars Europe.
[01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:13.128]  He has Paul Joseph Watson expand to Summit News.
[01:07:13.448 --> 01:07:17.128]  He hires me to host the War Room three hours a day from three to six.
[01:07:17.488 --> 01:07:21.329]  He has the morning show, the David Knight show morning for three hours.
[01:07:21.849 --> 01:07:23.410]  Whole crews on each of those shows.
[01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:25.430]  So that's what you get.
[01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:26.670]  We're good to go.
[01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:27.211]  We're good to go.
[01:07:27.231 --> 01:07:27.651]  We're good to go.
[01:07:27.671 --> 01:07:28.351]  We're good to go.
[01:07:29.071 --> 01:07:29.452]  We're good to go.
[01:07:29.472 --> 01:07:29.892]  We're good to go.
[01:07:29.912 --> 01:07:30.532]  We're good to go.
[01:07:30.552 --> 01:07:31.112]  We're good to go.
[01:07:31.452 --> 01:07:31.893]  We're good to go.
[01:07:31.913 --> 01:07:32.433]  We're good to go.
[01:07:32.493 --> 01:07:33.213]  We're good to go.
[01:07:33.233 --> 01:07:33.974]  We're good to go.
[01:07:33.994 --> 01:07:34.374]  We're good to go.
[01:07:34.394 --> 01:07:35.434]  We're good to go.
[01:07:35.454 --> 01:07:35.974]  We're good to go.
[01:07:36.034 --> 01:07:36.435]  We're good to go.
[01:07:36.555 --> 01:07:36.915]  We're good to go.
[01:07:36.975 --> 01:07:37.955]  We're good to go.
[01:07:37.975 --> 01:07:39.036]  We're good to go.
[01:07:39.076 --> 01:07:40.716]  We're good to go.
[01:07:40.737 --> 01:07:41.277]  We're good to go.
[01:07:41.297 --> 01:07:41.797]  We're good to go.
[01:07:41.817 --> 01:07:42.737]  We're good to go.
[01:07:42.817 --> 01:07:44.378]  We're good to go.
[01:07:44.418 --> 01:07:45.258]  We're good to go.
[01:07:45.299 --> 01:07:45.999]  We're good to go.
[01:07:46.099 --> 01:07:46.619]  We're good to go.
[01:07:46.639 --> 01:07:47.179]  We're good to go.
[01:07:47.219 --> 01:07:48.060]  We're good to go.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:48.500]  We're good to go.
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.380]  We're good to go.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:49.720]  We're good to go.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:50.261]  We're good to go.
[01:07:50.281 --> 01:07:51.181]  We're good to go.
[01:07:51.221 --> 01:07:51.621]  We're good to go.
[01:07:51.661 --> 01:07:52.122]  We're good to go.
[01:07:52.142 --> 01:07:52.482]  We're good to go.
[01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:52.662]  We're
[01:07:55.623 --> 01:08:01.586]  So that we can hire people like Dan Lyman to cover the news going on in Europe, and then bring them on to the show to discuss it.
[01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:03.587]  So, Dan Lyman joins me now.
[01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:09.009]  The latest poll shows Europeans strongly oppose mass migration, EU's handling of crisis.
[01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:20.255]  And Dan, really this poll, I think, reflects kind of every other poll that is anti-globalism, anti-open borders, and back towards nationalism and state sovereignty.
[01:08:21.724 --> 01:08:25.506]  That's absolutely correct, Owen, and things are definitely very interesting this weekend.
[01:08:25.906 --> 01:08:27.046]  Obviously, we have the elections.
[01:08:27.086 --> 01:08:30.688]  We've had the UK and Netherlands went to the polls yesterday.
[01:08:31.108 --> 01:08:34.269]  The Czechs and Ireland are in the polls today.
[01:08:34.769 --> 01:08:37.270]  Tomorrow, I believe, Slovakia goes to the polls.
[01:08:37.431 --> 01:08:43.093]  And then on Sunday, everyone else will head to the polls and cast their votes for the European Parliament.
[01:08:43.633 --> 01:09:03.130]  And by Sunday night we'll start getting unofficial election results and of course we've had some exit polling that kind of indicates where things are headed and some polling ahead of time but of course we take that all with a grain of salt because we never know how things are going to turn out as we saw with the 2016 presidential election in the US, as we saw with Brexit and even the recent Australian election.
[01:09:03.190 --> 01:09:09.336]  So polling should always be taken with a grain of salt but I think things do look good for the populist nationalist
[01:09:09.796 --> 01:09:16.438]  So you are expecting these voter turnouts to show a nationalist result and you think they have some, we'll say protest, ready to go?
[01:09:40.136 --> 01:09:41.678]  Protests are certainly possible.
[01:09:41.978 --> 01:09:45.701]  Today we have protests going on in Switzerland and Germany actually.
[01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:47.903]  They call them climate strikes.
[01:09:48.043 --> 01:09:58.652]  So in my town and across Switzerland and Germany and probably some neighboring countries as well, we have some pretty radical environmentalists out just chanting for climate justice.
[01:09:59.372 --> 01:10:05.738]  Apparently that's a big issue in Germany, especially with the the city dwellers that they're very concerned about climate change.
[01:10:06.538 --> 01:10:16.760]  So maybe that could sway the votes in Germany, certainly, but I don't think that that's as big of an issue continent-wide as the press would like people to think that it is.
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:25.521]  When you're looking at these elections, what countries do you think will be the first ones to go nationalist?
[01:10:25.601 --> 01:10:29.962]  Obviously, you know, you're looking at Britain right now with the Brexit, but who do you think follows?
[01:10:32.023 --> 01:10:32.623]  In terms of
[01:10:34.739 --> 01:10:37.964]  Who could be more dominoes to fall in the EU?
[01:10:38.265 --> 01:10:41.189]  There's some really interesting things happening in Denmark right now.
[01:10:41.269 --> 01:10:44.394]  They are really working towards hardening their borders.
[01:10:44.855 --> 01:10:49.763]  One of the biggest parties there just introduced a resolution they'd like to see a full asylum stop.
[01:10:50.343 --> 01:11:03.427]  Stopped through 2025 and they want to basically solidify the borders between themselves in Germany and also themselves in Sweden and Those those kinds of things are very hard to accomplish unless you get the EU's permission.
[01:11:03.467 --> 01:11:11.950]  So they've said that they want to move forward and introduce Referendums based on EU's internal border policy in the Shenzhen area.
[01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:14.191]  So I think there's very interesting things happening in
[01:11:14.711 --> 01:11:23.055]  In Denmark, we have in the Netherlands the possibility that the populists take the vote there, although that's kind of up in the air, but it's definitely trending in that direction.
[01:11:23.375 --> 01:11:30.298]  Every time there's an election now in the Netherlands, the press loves to say that Gert Wilders fell on his face, and they're still saying that even today.
[01:11:30.818 --> 01:11:39.242]  But every election he seems to gain seats in the Netherlands and also on the EU stage, and then also we have some other newcomers.
[01:11:39.702 --> 01:11:40.222]  I don't know.
[01:11:58.088 --> 01:12:04.050]  The support is swinging in the favor of Marine Le Pen and her new party, the National Rally.
[01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:09.412]  As of right now, they are leading the polls and so those are really the big countries that everyone's keeping an eye on.
[01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:17.035]  I don't think things will change too much in Germany, although I think AFD continues to gain ground, of course.
[01:12:17.735 --> 01:12:30.322]  And then also there is talk that when Angela Merkel is completed with her term as Chancellor of Germany, she may move into European government at the super state level.
[01:12:30.422 --> 01:12:33.123]  So it's all interesting to see where it's all going to go from here for sure.
[01:12:33.643 --> 01:12:39.246]  Now, does the media have the same role in these elections as they do in the West?
[01:12:39.866 --> 01:12:46.850]  Total leftist, total globalism to try to keep the people from voting nationalist and for their own state sovereignty?
[01:12:48.141 --> 01:12:48.641]  Absolutely.
[01:12:48.681 --> 01:12:52.004]  The media is just as bad here as it is in the U.S., in some cases worse.
[01:12:53.024 --> 01:13:00.689]  But, you know, they take all of these movements, for instance, the Brexit Party, which I would consider a mainstream conservative party.
[01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:04.752]  The actual conservative party there, the Tories, they are not faring well at all.
[01:13:04.812 --> 01:13:11.637]  Obviously, we just saw the Prime Minister just step down and their support has just plummeted at one of the lowest it's been in decades.
[01:13:12.517 --> 01:13:14.679]  Because I don't think that they're an actual conservative party.
[01:13:14.699 --> 01:13:16.561]  They're not conserving anything in Britain, of course.
[01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:18.162]  Britain is going by the wayside.
[01:13:18.202 --> 01:13:23.126]  The Brexit party would be considered at this point just an anti-globalist party.
[01:13:23.466 --> 01:13:27.869]  There's all sorts of, all shapes and colors of people running as Brexit candidates.
[01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:32.273]  But of course, they get smeared as far right and you see that happening across Europe.
[01:13:32.513 --> 01:13:35.636]  And I think people are starting to become immune to that label.
[01:13:35.676 --> 01:13:37.237]  They see that and they just roll their eyes.
[01:13:37.857 --> 01:13:41.738]  The only people that really buy that now are just, they're just, they're lost anyways.
[01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:45.839]  So, the media has not done itself any service in Europe.
[01:13:45.919 --> 01:13:57.963]  If you want to know what it's like, just picture how much fools of themselves CNN has made of themselves in recent years and you can imagine how people are feeling about their particular outlets across the countries in Europe.
[01:13:58.769 --> 01:14:00.210]  Do you agree with my analysis?
[01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:10.038]  The reason why the EU cannot have the Brexit happen is they realize if the Brexit happens, that's the first domino to fall and then other countries are going to want to get out.
[01:14:10.478 --> 01:14:12.419]  I think if Brexit happens, the EU is done.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:12.860]  Do you agree?
[01:14:13.943 --> 01:14:15.065]  I think absolutely.
[01:14:15.105 --> 01:14:16.367]  It's trending in that direction.
[01:14:16.767 --> 01:14:18.750]  It's all a matter of how they execute it.
[01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:29.786]  Of course Farage is taking the reins again with the Brexit movement and if he can pull them out by sheer will and with this great surge of support behind him and his candidates.
[01:14:30.206 --> 01:14:33.448]  Then I think, you know, the EU is, of course, they're terrified of that.
[01:14:33.909 --> 01:14:39.752]  And we saw interesting comments recently from Jean-Claude Juncker, who is the head of the EU.
[01:14:40.133 --> 01:14:42.835]  He basically, I mean, this guy just shoots himself in the foot.
[01:14:43.135 --> 01:14:45.756]  I think he drinks way too much and says things that he probably shouldn't.
[01:14:45.817 --> 01:14:53.141]  But he went on record with CNN saying that populist nationalists, he called them stupid nationalists, they are in love with their own countries.
[01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:54.482]  And he was ridiculing that.
[01:14:54.742 --> 01:14:58.085]  I don't think people take too well to that if they happen to catch that news.
[01:14:58.125 --> 01:14:59.746]  And they kind of realize at this point.
[01:15:02.469 --> 01:15:12.639]  Well, it was literally Hitler's brainchild was the EU, so it's kind of ironic that that's where we're at here.
[01:15:13.039 --> 01:15:21.528]  But yeah, Jean-Claude Juncker says you're stupid if you're a nationalist, so he's literally insulting people if they love their country, but that's...
[01:15:22.409 --> 01:15:23.990]  That's like a weird trend now, Dan.
[01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:28.012]  I mean, you see it from journalists in the West that hate America.
[01:15:28.432 --> 01:15:38.237]  You see it about, in fact, there was something, there was, I believe it was a Russian diplomat or someone just received an award and she gave a speech and she was like, yeah, I really love Russia.
[01:15:38.517 --> 01:15:42.519]  And the media attacked her like, oh, yeah, you love authoritarian Russia.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:43.720]  You love corruption.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:44.861]  You're a statist.
[01:15:44.901 --> 01:15:47.022]  And it's just like, no, she's just saying she loves her country.
[01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.042]  She loves representing the country.
[01:15:48.062 --> 01:15:49.023]  She's going to work hard for Russia.
[01:15:49.383 --> 01:15:51.404]  These people want everybody to hate their country.
[01:15:51.444 --> 01:15:57.247]  It's very strange that they think globalism is the answer for all of their shortcomings.
[01:15:57.287 --> 01:15:59.849]  Dan Lyman from Europe Wars with us.
[01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:00.509]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:16:07.633 --> 01:16:08.874]  The United States
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:26.434]  ...has been the apple of the world's eye for 244 years because our electoral system fused ancient Roman, ancient Greek, ancient Judaic law, ancient British common law systems from the Iroquois Federation in the Northwest into Canada.
[01:16:26.534 --> 01:16:27.495]  That is the system.
[01:16:27.715 --> 01:16:29.076]  It had checks and balances.
[01:16:29.096 --> 01:16:31.098]  It didn't allow for dictators.
[01:16:31.678 --> 01:16:33.740]  It didn't allow for too much concentration of power.
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:39.844]  And what were you going to do if the North of the United States had three times the population of the South?
[01:16:40.345 --> 01:16:42.766]  Geographically, the South was much larger.
[01:16:42.887 --> 01:16:53.074]  You didn't want to have the majority of the North be able to set all the laws for the South because you'd just be replacing King George III with Northern voters.
[01:16:54.055 --> 01:16:56.457]  It's called the tyranny of the majority.
[01:16:57.592 --> 01:17:03.896]  In a classic democracy, if 51% vote to kill you, it happens.
[01:17:04.216 --> 01:17:11.301]  Actually, in ancient Greece, when they had original pure democracy in one particular city-state, they had black stones for no, white stones for yes.
[01:17:11.561 --> 01:17:14.163]  And only the gentry elite could vote, but it was a pure democracy.
[01:17:14.283 --> 01:17:17.205]  And if they didn't like what you said, there was no judge or jury.
[01:17:17.305 --> 01:17:18.205]  There was the people's jury.
[01:17:18.286 --> 01:17:23.509]  And they would put rocks in the bucket saying, kill you, and you would be thrown off a cliff or given hemlock.
[01:17:23.729 --> 01:17:27.312]  And most of the famous philosophers actually were ordered to kill themselves.
[01:17:27.452 --> 01:17:28.733]  That was, of course, Athens.
[01:17:28.973 --> 01:17:31.655]  You might want to look into pure democracy.
[01:17:32.416 --> 01:17:34.697]  51% said, kill somebody?
[01:17:35.018 --> 01:17:37.259]  You are double dead.
[01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:42.823]  Now, we have a constitutional republic, or a liberal democracy.
[01:17:42.843 --> 01:17:45.806]  So, imagine you're somebody in Wyoming.
[01:17:45.906 --> 01:17:48.708]  You only get three members of the House of Representatives.
[01:17:48.948 --> 01:17:50.349]  California, how many do they have?
[01:17:50.369 --> 01:17:50.829]  50-something?
[01:17:50.869 --> 01:17:51.770]  It's an incredible number.
[01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:52.110]  Look it up.
[01:17:52.170 --> 01:17:52.491]  I forget.
[01:17:53.291 --> 01:17:53.812]  I don't know.
[01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:11.032]  Still has those two Senators.
[01:18:11.572 --> 01:18:20.602]  And previous to the 17th Amendment from 1913, the same day we got the Federal Reserve, same day we got the IRS, our new system, they took the Senators away.
[01:18:20.742 --> 01:18:25.528]  The Senators weren't just a check on the House, they were a check on the executive.
[01:18:25.748 --> 01:18:27.710]  Senators were from the state.
[01:18:27.850 --> 01:18:31.234]  So that you have 50 states in a confederation, 13 states at that time,
[01:18:31.374 --> 01:18:36.897]  And they foresaw a civil war if you could have the tyranny of the majority vote away the rights of others.
[01:18:36.977 --> 01:18:39.979]  And that kind of still happened with the Civil War that came up in the 1860s.
[01:18:40.059 --> 01:18:41.160]  So our system isn't perfect.
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:46.703]  And so you don't want two or three states in a popular vote being able to presidentially outvote everybody else.
[01:18:46.883 --> 01:18:49.044]  But getting rid of the Electoral College goes far beyond that.
[01:18:49.244 --> 01:18:59.871]  It completes what the globalists tried to do in 1913 with the Federal Reserve and the 17th Amendment, where senators used to be elected by the House or the legislature in their state.
[01:18:59.931 --> 01:19:00.591]  Let me explain that again.
[01:19:00.731 --> 01:19:09.856]  They would have votes in the state legislatures over who their senator was they were going to send so that it was a federal office.
[01:19:11.257 --> 01:19:20.123]  But it was a creature of the state giving the state direct veto power into the Senate in case those senators got bought off.
[01:19:20.723 --> 01:19:23.985]  So checks and balances inside checks and balances.
[01:19:24.366 --> 01:19:27.908]  The world envy of the planet.
[01:19:28.468 --> 01:19:32.511]  The closest to perfection you're going to find.
[01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:33.632]  No one has denied it.
[01:19:34.492 --> 01:19:36.133]  Easy to rig parliamentary systems.
[01:19:36.754 --> 01:19:37.935]  Easy to rig other systems.
[01:19:38.275 --> 01:19:39.356]  Very hard to rig this one.
[01:19:39.836 --> 01:19:43.959]  And that's why they want to get rid of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:44.059 --> 01:19:45.019]  And they're very close.
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:45.900]  They're very close.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.362]  They've gotten most of the blue wall states to pass it.
[01:19:48.482 --> 01:19:59.790]  And then we'll have the tyranny, just like in science fiction, you know, movies out there, where you've got the different districts, and the one big powerful district, like in Hunger Games, rules all the others, because it has the big population.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:26.453]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.774 --> 01:20:29.255]  This is an info war, folks.
[01:20:30.275 --> 01:20:32.817]  Let me tell you something right now.
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:39.343]  If you've got excuses in life, you're probably a loser.
[01:20:39.363 --> 01:20:40.464]  Okay?
[01:20:41.765 --> 01:20:42.686]  I don't want excuses anymore.
[01:20:43.807 --> 01:20:45.229]  I want victory.
[01:20:45.249 --> 01:20:46.250]  Okay?
[01:20:47.674 --> 01:20:51.816]  Now luckily, this audience is full of winners.
[01:20:52.437 --> 01:20:53.858]  This staff is full of winners.
[01:20:53.898 --> 01:20:56.979]  Just look at what Dan Lyman has done with Europe Wars.
[01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:58.600]  Look at the great work.
[01:20:59.201 --> 01:21:00.641]  Listen to the last segment with Dan.
[01:21:01.282 --> 01:21:03.163]  You're not going to get this kind of coverage anywhere else.
[01:21:03.703 --> 01:21:06.185]  Thank God for your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:21:07.165 --> 01:21:08.386]  We would not be here without you.
[01:21:09.987 --> 01:21:13.148]  And, we've got a bunch of InfoWarriors in town this weekend.
[01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:16.110]  Because we take action.
[01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:17.271]  The InfoWars Army.
[01:21:18.459 --> 01:21:23.382]  And I want to apologize because I know you guys are blowing me up pretty much nonstop.
[01:21:23.902 --> 01:21:31.486]  You're trying to use InfoComms to organize and to get in touch with people for the protests coming up at Planned Parenthood here on Sunday.
[01:21:31.946 --> 01:21:33.127]  But InfoComms is down.
[01:21:33.747 --> 01:21:36.589]  I don't know if or when it'll be back up, so I apologize for that.
[01:21:37.769 --> 01:21:44.153]  But we will be out there on Sunday, Planned Parenthood in Austin, Texas, 7th Street at noon.
[01:21:44.793 --> 01:21:45.594]  I'm giving a speech at 2.
[01:21:47.409 --> 01:21:49.550]  And so I'm looking forward to seeing you all out there.
[01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:51.851]  Sorry you can't communicate on InfoComms.
[01:21:51.951 --> 01:21:52.491]  It's down.
[01:21:53.712 --> 01:21:55.513]  You know, we deal with a lot of sabotage here.
[01:21:55.573 --> 01:21:57.614]  People trying to take our servers, shutting us down.
[01:21:57.634 --> 01:21:59.415]  Obviously the censorship.
[01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:02.796]  So I apologize that that's going on.
[01:22:02.816 --> 01:22:06.538]  I wish it wasn't the case, but we will be out there Sunday.
[01:22:06.618 --> 01:22:09.660]  So this is not a sign that we're not going to be there.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.281]  This is not a sign that we're canceling the event or anything.
[01:22:13.328 --> 01:22:14.608]  We're just dealing with some tech issues.
[01:22:16.429 --> 01:22:20.149]  So I don't know if InfoComms will be up, but we're still going to be out there.
[01:22:20.189 --> 01:22:22.450]  So the people asking me, hey, are you still going out there Sunday?
[01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:23.710]  I can't see anything on InfoComms.
[01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:25.070]  We are still going out there.
[01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:27.091]  We're just dealing with some technical issues.
[01:22:27.631 --> 01:22:31.651]  And so I get your messages about the videos not working.
[01:22:31.911 --> 01:22:32.712]  We get all your messages.
[01:22:32.752 --> 01:22:33.972]  We're trying our best here, folks.
[01:22:35.532 --> 01:22:38.033]  You can just imagine the type of sabotage that we have to endure.
[01:22:38.693 --> 01:22:40.033]  Now, Dan Lyman.
[01:22:41.949 --> 01:22:48.614]  It's really incredible here because globalism has been exposed and that was its real Achilles heel.
[01:22:49.414 --> 01:22:54.818]  Globalism had to be brought on in the shadows because as soon as people learned about it, they didn't want it.
[01:22:54.938 --> 01:23:01.723]  As soon as you have Jean-Claude Juncker saying you're stupid if you're a nationalist, people started raising their eyebrow.
[01:23:02.123 --> 01:23:06.587]  As soon as you had people saying you're a bigot if you're a nationalist, people started
[01:23:07.347 --> 01:23:08.228]  Scratching their heads.
[01:23:08.348 --> 01:23:11.049]  So, globalism has been completely unmasked.
[01:23:11.369 --> 01:23:16.352]  The media is trying to keep the mask on and tell you that nationalism is the enemy.
[01:23:16.892 --> 01:23:18.373]  I don't see it working right now, Dan.
[01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:20.694]  I think that Europe is going the way of the Brexit.
[01:23:20.754 --> 01:23:23.295]  They're going to do everything they can to stop it, but they won't be able to.
[01:23:23.315 --> 01:23:27.897]  I think we're starting to see, I would say, if, I think, what would you give it?
[01:23:28.057 --> 01:23:32.540]  If Brexit happens, I think the EU has less than 20 years, probably.
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:32.980]  What do you think?
[01:23:34.105 --> 01:23:35.926]  I think that's certainly a fair assessment.
[01:23:36.246 --> 01:23:40.449]  It's kind of unprecedented, this whole situation, as to how it will pan out.
[01:23:41.089 --> 01:23:43.510]  But, you know, I mean, it could happen quickly.
[01:23:43.971 --> 01:23:49.033]  The USSR fell pretty quickly when it looked pretty strong just a few years before.
[01:23:49.173 --> 01:23:52.195]  So we will see how things do pan out in that regard.
[01:23:52.235 --> 01:23:55.377]  But I think 20 years is definitely a very safe prediction.
[01:23:55.677 --> 01:23:58.779]  And as you were saying about globalism in general, that it's kind of been
[01:23:59.199 --> 01:24:07.284]  It's been masked, and even the term globalist five years ago, when I would use that term with normal friends, they would have no idea what I was talking about.
[01:24:07.324 --> 01:24:11.607]  It sounded like some crazy code word that, you know, some crazy Illuminati code word.
[01:24:12.127 --> 01:24:21.614]  And now, I mean, the word is used openly in mainstream publications by the President of the United States and even by, you know, politicians around the world and the media.
[01:24:21.654 --> 01:24:24.896]  So that is out in the open, and that agenda is out in the open.
[01:24:25.596 --> 01:24:45.903]  And I kind of want to I want to touch a couple of stories here that give people an idea of what's going on on the ground that is influencing the way people feel because the number one issue facing Europe and the voters will say this in general is migration and the effects of it, illegal migration in particular.
[01:24:46.323 --> 01:24:49.624]  And then, of course, terrorism is a concern in some of the countries.
[01:24:50.145 --> 01:24:51.905]  Economics are a big concern as well.
[01:24:51.965 --> 01:24:53.986]  So like in Greece and Italy and Portugal,
[01:24:54.366 --> 01:24:54.546]  I think?
[01:25:12.809 --> 01:25:14.530]  And it's influencing votes for sure.
[01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:19.033]  So just a few minutes ago, earlier today, a bomb just went off in Lyon, France.
[01:25:19.413 --> 01:25:21.874]  They're still getting information about that, but it's a parcel bomb.
[01:25:21.894 --> 01:25:25.857]  They're calling it an attack, and at least eight people were injured, including a child.
[01:25:25.917 --> 01:25:31.400]  So that's just like one little snapshot of what happened in France today, right before they go to the polls.
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:35.942]  So you know that's going to influence a few people in Lyon when they head to the polls, maybe nationwide.
[01:25:36.282 --> 01:25:37.123]  That's one example.
[01:25:37.503 --> 01:25:57.547]  Another example is that in the Netherlands, the migration minister just had to resign in the middle of a scandal because it was uncovered that the immigration ministry was hiding details about crimes being committed by migrants and that was unearthed actually by De Telegraaf, which is a mainstream publication.
[01:25:57.967 --> 01:26:07.340]  They discovered that the figures that were being put out were masking really heinous crimes such as rape, murder, child abuse, child sexual abuse by migrants.
[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:12.566]  And this all came out just a couple days ago and the migration minister had to step down.
[01:26:12.627 --> 01:26:14.950]  That has rocked Dutch politics.
[01:26:16.074 --> 01:26:16.294]  I think?
[01:26:35.385 --> 01:26:50.512]  Now, things got so bad, as you and I discussed a couple weeks ago, that the bus drivers stopped stopping at this station and it came out that some of the cleaning staff were getting, they were getting vaccines for hepatitis and things were so bad there.
[01:26:50.893 --> 01:26:57.476]  Things looked so bad just days before the election that they made a big deal about clearing all of the migrants out of this park.
[01:26:57.976 --> 01:27:08.922]  So they're trying to clean up their image right before the vote so that when Brussels people are riding on the trains and they pass through the station, they don't see this testament to globalism with just migrants laying all over the place.
[01:27:09.322 --> 01:27:12.764]  Now what has come out since then is that it's just a temporary fix.
[01:27:12.864 --> 01:27:18.727]  A lot of the migrants have just moved over to this park, Maximilian Park nearby, where hundreds of them loitered during the day.
[01:27:19.547 --> 01:27:20.908]  And right now they're sleeping there.
[01:27:20.948 --> 01:27:22.109]  They're not welcome in the station.
[01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:25.410]  But police are saying, just wait until a few days after the election.
[01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:26.611]  They'll all be allowed back in.
[01:27:27.171 --> 01:27:30.512]  So these are things that people are seeing in their everyday lives.
[01:27:30.832 --> 01:27:31.712]  Now, hold on a second.
[01:27:31.772 --> 01:27:33.012]  This is actually amazing.
[01:27:34.193 --> 01:27:35.833]  Who is making this order?
[01:27:35.873 --> 01:27:41.534]  Because you're now saying that the police are essentially engaged in a political cover-up.
[01:27:43.855 --> 01:27:48.856]  Well, there are police officers who have spoken and a chief inspector in Brussels who have spoken.
[01:27:48.896 --> 01:27:50.836]  Well, yeah, I'm not blaming the individual policemen.
[01:27:50.856 --> 01:27:54.237]  I'm saying that they're getting orders to engage in a political cover-up.
[01:27:55.006 --> 01:27:55.866]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:27:56.006 --> 01:28:05.390]  And this is just a little band-aid right before the election just to keep people, you know, tied it over and say, oh, we're making it, you know, we're making things better and we'll solve this all.
[01:28:05.850 --> 01:28:07.911]  And that doesn't look like what's happening.
[01:28:07.971 --> 01:28:15.274]  And I think people, if they see that and they know what's going on just in Brussels, for instance, they're going to say, you know, these people are not serious about solving the issues.
[01:28:15.654 --> 01:28:20.296]  We have in Germany, Merkel has said migration must continue.
[01:28:20.336 --> 01:28:21.757]  We must continue to accept more.
[01:28:21.877 --> 01:28:23.137]  Sweden is saying the same thing.
[01:28:23.177 --> 01:28:24.478]  We must continue to accept more.
[01:28:24.878 --> 01:28:26.761]  The backlash is coming this weekend.
[01:28:27.261 --> 01:28:31.367]  Maybe it's not the final straw for some of these countries, but it's definitely the tide is turning.
[01:28:32.742 --> 01:28:33.963]  Well, there's no doubt about that.
[01:28:34.283 --> 01:28:40.187]  And again, this is why they're trying to stop Brexit with everything they got.
[01:28:40.647 --> 01:28:46.731]  Because I'm telling you, folks, if Brexit happens, every other country is going to be looking at it and saying, wow, well, we don't want to be involved in this either.
[01:28:46.851 --> 01:28:48.012]  This doesn't help our country.
[01:28:48.532 --> 01:28:50.514]  All right, Dan Lyman, if you can, stick around for another segment.
[01:28:50.554 --> 01:28:54.797]  I'd like to get into the social media censorship with you, if you can do another segment with us.
[01:28:55.017 --> 01:28:58.559]  But just amazing coverage from Dan Lyman at EuropeWars.com, folks.
[01:28:58.979 --> 01:28:59.700]  Just great stuff.
[01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:09.891]  I didn't go to college for marketing.
[01:29:10.752 --> 01:29:13.054]  I don't sit around and have traditional marketing meetings.
[01:29:13.554 --> 01:29:16.336]  I go with my gut and how I want to be treated.
[01:29:17.597 --> 01:29:18.658]  So I do market research.
[01:29:18.858 --> 01:29:19.979]  What's already the highest rated?
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.721]  What already is the best selling?
[01:29:23.262 --> 01:29:24.122]  And then we go look at it.
[01:29:24.803 --> 01:29:27.185]  We make it better and sell it for a lower price.
[01:29:27.905 --> 01:29:29.647]  Viewers and listeners understand my philosophy.
[01:29:30.027 --> 01:29:30.808]  And you've responded.
[01:29:30.888 --> 01:29:37.493]  We have a very large successful supplement company because the quality is amazing and because of your support.
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:46.683]  Looking into this a few years ago, I was like, you know, I forget to take supplements myself, and our listeners forget.
[01:29:47.304 --> 01:29:49.765]  How do I get myself and others to remember to take it?
[01:29:50.706 --> 01:29:55.209]  And my crew, who was just getting into marketing, goes, it's funny you say that, boss.
[01:29:56.530 --> 01:29:59.792]  Everything for 20 years, and now more than ever, is PAX.
[01:30:01.169 --> 01:30:03.350]  One pack a day, two packs a day, three packs a day.
[01:30:03.670 --> 01:30:04.550]  So it's all there.
[01:30:04.810 --> 01:30:05.411]  You don't forget.
[01:30:05.431 --> 01:30:06.331]  It's not a bunch of bottles.
[01:30:06.691 --> 01:30:07.591]  You put it in your pocket.
[01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:08.352]  You put it in your purse.
[01:30:08.372 --> 01:30:09.052]  You put it in your wallet.
[01:30:09.072 --> 01:30:10.413]  You put it in your car, your truck.
[01:30:10.493 --> 01:30:10.913]  It's ready.
[01:30:11.533 --> 01:30:13.554]  That's the eight-pack PowerStack.

[01:30:27.299 --> 01:30:29.460]  And 13 pills, eight new formulas,
[01:30:30.442 --> 01:30:31.263]  It's amazing.

[01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:57.791]  All those work together synergistically.

[01:31:09.378 --> 01:31:09.999]  Ladies and gentlemen,

[01:31:17.062 --> 01:31:19.924]  This is retail up there like a hundred bucks.

[01:31:25.685 --> 01:31:31.189]  A major gamble for us because I believe you're going to reorder it close to the regular price and support the M4 after.
[01:31:31.749 --> 01:31:34.791]  This is total health and performance.
[01:31:35.592 --> 01:31:36.953]  I treat my body like hell.
[01:31:37.073 --> 01:31:38.674]  I work 18 hours a day many days.
[01:31:39.015 --> 01:31:40.256]  I take on the weight of the world.
[01:31:40.376 --> 01:31:45.660]  I focus on the injustice and I face the enemy and I fight them at every level.
[01:31:46.414 --> 01:31:51.036]  And there's no way, without the supplements from InFoolishLife.com, I could do it.

[01:33:24.008 --> 01:33:25.430]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:25.690 --> 01:33:26.831]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:27.392 --> 01:33:28.814]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.354 --> 01:33:32.418]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:32.438 --> 01:33:34.921]  You know, I forgot to ask Dan Lyman.
[01:33:35.382 --> 01:33:37.985]  Hey Dan, have you taken your honk pill today?
[01:33:38.005 --> 01:33:41.349]  Oh, I overload on those every day.
[01:33:41.409 --> 01:33:43.812]  It's the only way to cope with the madness.
[01:33:45.329 --> 01:33:46.290]  I'm overdosed right now.
[01:33:46.730 --> 01:33:47.990]  The clown world order, man.
[01:33:48.211 --> 01:33:48.891]  It's here for us.
[01:33:49.151 --> 01:33:50.171]  It's trying to take us over.
[01:33:50.232 --> 01:33:51.672]  DanLymanEuropeWars.com.
[01:33:52.553 --> 01:33:54.033]  So yes, the honk pill, folks.
[01:33:54.494 --> 01:33:57.075]  That's how you survive in the clown world without going insane.
[01:33:57.475 --> 01:33:57.695]  But!
[01:33:57.775 --> 01:34:01.437]  I'm very thankful for the clown, the clown, the honk pills because...
[01:34:02.197 --> 01:34:19.763]  When I first started, you know, figuring out everything that was going on years ago, it would just make me so mad and to try to like channel that and not become an angry person is hard and the honk pill definitely helps you to just turn your anger and nihilism into, you know, just have a bit of fun with it because there's only so much you can do about it at the moment.
[01:34:20.393 --> 01:34:25.234]  Yes, and unfortunately the Honk Pill is not something that we can sell at the InfoWars store.
[01:34:25.314 --> 01:34:30.536]  You have to find it within yourself and out there in the ether, if you will.
[01:34:31.116 --> 01:34:33.837]  But we do have great supplements at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:33.857 --> 01:34:38.978]  Now, we just came out with a brand new 8-pack PowerStack.
[01:34:39.038 --> 01:34:39.899]  It's 50% off.
[01:34:40.039 --> 01:34:41.099]  So here's the story with this.
[01:34:42.259 --> 01:34:55.832]  If you are somebody that's curious about supplements or you've never supplemented or you're thinking about starting but you really don't know what to do because you're new to it, this is the perfect combo for you.
[01:34:55.852 --> 01:34:56.913]  The 8-pack Power Stack.
[01:34:56.933 --> 01:35:04.660]  So basically what you have here is you have the morning time supplement case and then the evening time.
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:05.581]  I got them both right here.
[01:35:07.008 --> 01:35:12.534]  So you've got your AM, you take these in the morning, and then you've got your PM, and you take these at night.
[01:35:12.554 --> 01:35:23.025]  So again, if you're new to supplementing, and you just haven't done all the research, but you're interested and you're curious and want to see how it affects you, the 8-pack PowerStack is the best way to start.
[01:35:23.065 --> 01:35:28.250]  Because we put the great supplements in here that we think are the best that you need,
[01:35:29.071 --> 01:35:38.202]  And then you don't even have to worry about figuring out, you know, what supplements are best or going through the process of picking out eight or nine different supplements to figure out what you want to take in the morning or the night.
[01:35:39.043 --> 01:35:40.765]  We've done that all for you.
[01:35:41.125 --> 01:35:42.286]  And so this is the perfect
[01:35:43.123 --> 01:35:48.669]  If you're a beginner or even if you're an expert and you just want to simplify things, the 8-Pack Power Stack.

[01:36:17.266 --> 01:36:21.928]  So you cannot beat that deal at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:36:22.428 --> 01:36:25.288]  Alright, Dan Lyman, I want to talk censorship with you here.
[01:36:25.528 --> 01:36:28.609]  Oh, and by the way, coming up next, I can't even believe this, folks.
[01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:30.409]  This is actually next level.
[01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:32.170]  Because I was actually wrong.
[01:36:33.570 --> 01:36:34.130]  I will admit it.
[01:36:34.731 --> 01:36:41.074]  I'm big enough to admit, when I was wrong, it wasn't Nancy Pelosi that was gonna pass out on a camera live.
[01:36:41.594 --> 01:36:44.956]  It actually was Jerry Nadler and he literally just did it.
[01:36:45.636 --> 01:36:46.596]  We've got the footage.
[01:36:47.677 --> 01:36:51.139]  Democrat douchebag Jerry Nadler literally just passed out.
[01:36:52.799 --> 01:36:53.300]  On camera.
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:59.683]  And so, I thought Nancy would be first, but Nancy's next.
[01:37:01.374 --> 01:37:11.005]  So, you know, I don't wanna... I mean, he could be seriously ill, so I'm not trying to... I'm not trying to make fun of him or anything, but this is the state of the Democrat Party, folks.
[01:37:11.486 --> 01:37:14.049]  The Jerry Nadlers and Nancy Pelosi's, they're gone.
[01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:15.791]  They're not even there.
[01:37:16.632 --> 01:37:18.054]  They don't belong in office.
[01:37:18.294 --> 01:37:19.555]  They're the ones that are unfit.
[01:37:19.916 --> 01:37:21.318]  They're the ones that are unhealthy.
[01:37:22.443 --> 01:37:24.585]  Okay, so we've got that coming up.
[01:37:24.625 --> 01:37:25.126]  It's unbelievable.
[01:37:25.146 --> 01:37:27.588]  But Dan, President Trump tweets this out.
[01:37:28.128 --> 01:37:34.314]  When is Twitter going to allow the very popular conservative voices that it has so viciously shut down back into the open?
[01:37:34.795 --> 01:37:35.355]  It is time.
[01:37:35.956 --> 01:37:41.941]  You also have Senator Josh Hawley saying he wants to shut down Facebook and Instagram, which I actually agree with.
[01:37:42.001 --> 01:37:42.802]  I'd say just shut them down.
[01:37:42.822 --> 01:37:43.283]  Just screw them.
[01:37:44.384 --> 01:37:45.705]  But Dan, what do you think about this?
[01:37:47.125 --> 01:37:49.227]  I saw the Krassensteins get banned from Twitter.
[01:37:49.828 --> 01:37:51.269]  I think that there's a head fake there.
[01:37:51.449 --> 01:37:53.151]  I don't really buy that as an organic thing.
[01:37:53.732 --> 01:37:55.654]  So where do you think the censorship is at right now?
[01:37:56.635 --> 01:37:59.618]  What do you take of the Krassenstein ban and the President's tweet?
[01:38:01.269 --> 01:38:03.190]  The Krasnostine ban is so strange.
[01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:18.500]  Something about it, like, I agree with you, something about it is, um, something, something strange, like, is going on behind the scenes because they've been allowed to operate the way that they have for so long, um, and they are such a, uh, they're such icons in the resistance movement.
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:23.123]  And they just pulled that stunt a few days ago where they, where they pulled their accounts for five hours.
[01:38:23.183 --> 01:38:26.004]  So, uh, I, I'd love to know what's going on there.
[01:38:26.104 --> 01:38:28.746]  I'm hesitant to jump on any conclusions.
[01:38:29.466 --> 01:38:30.167]  Um, I did,
[01:38:30.487 --> 01:38:40.915]  You know, there was some people on our side of the ball that used that opportunity to take a stand for free speech and say that they do have a right to be on the platform and shouldn't be kicked off.
[01:38:41.295 --> 01:38:48.541]  By all means, if it's a matter of free speech and them being suppressed in that way, then I'm all for that too.
[01:38:48.861 --> 01:38:57.948]  However, I feel that there's more going on behind the scenes and either they became a liability or there's something else in store or they're, like you said, is a head fake in play.
[01:38:58.570 --> 01:39:06.812]  I think it's a head fake, and I think what they've done is they've taken the two Krasatins, obviously like you said, very popular for the anti-Trumpers on Twitter.
[01:39:07.212 --> 01:39:09.953]  I mean, I think they reply a dozen times to every Trump tweet.
[01:39:10.713 --> 01:39:13.614]  Trump farts and they sniff the air to think if they can tweet something.
[01:39:14.374 --> 01:39:17.875]  So I think that this was a planned ban.
[01:39:18.835 --> 01:39:24.396]  And they went with the bot angle, because I mean, anybody... I mean, I've had people come up to me and say, hey man, I can bot.
[01:39:24.416 --> 01:39:25.057]  You want to pay me?
[01:39:25.097 --> 01:39:26.537]  I'll get you a million followers on Twitter.
[01:39:26.557 --> 01:39:28.297]  So these programs are already out there.
[01:39:28.497 --> 01:39:29.698]  It's very mainstream, actually.
[01:39:30.138 --> 01:39:38.520]  In fact, there's the Twitter audit, where you can go audit people's followers, and you can find out pretty easily if their follow count is actually fake bots or real accounts.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:41.261]  And so this is something that's been going on for a while.
[01:39:41.361 --> 01:39:42.681]  Twitter obviously knows about it.
[01:39:43.401 --> 01:39:46.722]  The Krasensteins, if they were doing it, I mean, who knows if you believe it or not,
[01:39:47.362 --> 01:39:49.363]  Uh, probably have been doing it for a long time.
[01:39:49.764 --> 01:39:50.704]  Twitter would have known that.
[01:39:51.085 --> 01:40:03.133]  So I think that they hit the Krasensteins to say, see, we're censoring both sides, and then they used the bot angle so that they can then use that narrative to say, oh, it's the bots that are showing Trump is so popular.
[01:40:03.193 --> 01:40:03.953]  It's not organic.
[01:40:03.993 --> 01:40:14.060]  So to me, it's Twitter signaling we're getting ready for another wave of censorship against conservatives, and we're going to use bots as the excuse.
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:16.682]  And I think the president is privy to it.
[01:40:17.322 --> 01:40:19.344]  And I think that's why he put this tweet out, Dan.
[01:40:20.746 --> 01:40:21.787]  That's certainly possible.
[01:40:21.927 --> 01:40:24.430]  And, you know, people have been clamoring for a while now.
[01:40:24.490 --> 01:40:25.791]  When is Trump going to do something?
[01:40:26.232 --> 01:40:27.153]  Donald Trump Jr.
[01:40:27.213 --> 01:40:28.814]  is really on top of this situation.
[01:40:28.854 --> 01:40:30.116]  He talks about it all the time.
[01:40:30.696 --> 01:40:33.339]  And so they know what's going on.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:38.685]  And my hope is that there's something in the works that they're taking their time with.
[01:40:39.369 --> 01:40:47.719]  Before they comprehensively go after the issue, because if they're not, then this is definitely a huge problem.
[01:40:47.799 --> 01:40:56.929]  It's a problem across the world with all these elections, the way that parties are being censored, the way that important figures are being censored, members of the media, the conservative media.
[01:40:56.969 --> 01:40:58.511]  Raheem Kassam was just taken down.
[01:40:59.091 --> 01:40:59.432]  I think?
[01:41:15.808 --> 01:41:16.128]  I think?
[01:41:33.682 --> 01:41:38.286]  So, he definitely needs to make a move and needs to make a move soon in order to protect free speech.
[01:41:38.446 --> 01:41:40.507]  And I do love this Josh Hawley.
[01:41:40.588 --> 01:41:41.708]  I've watched some of his speeches.
[01:41:41.728 --> 01:41:42.769]  The guy's fantastic.
[01:41:42.789 --> 01:41:46.432]  So, I mean, if that's the future of this movement, then we're moving in a good direction.
[01:41:46.452 --> 01:41:59.082]  We just need more of him and we need some more time to build up, you know, our momentum as well and to be able to speak when we feel like we should be able to speak on social media or in public without being milkshakes being thrown on us, etc.
[01:41:59.975 --> 01:42:04.840]  Yeah, Josh Hawley from Missouri has turned out to be quite an all-star of a senator.
[01:42:05.661 --> 01:42:08.364]  So, yeah, I mean, we'll have to find out, you know.
[01:42:09.666 --> 01:42:12.389]  Snapchat employees abuse data access to spy on users.
[01:42:12.469 --> 01:42:15.953]  Facebook fake account removal doubles in six months to three billion.
[01:42:15.973 --> 01:42:19.436]  I mean, so these companies are, they're having their problems.
[01:42:20.475 --> 01:42:23.718]  But you know, think about it, Dan, if you know, because who pays for these?
[01:42:24.278 --> 01:42:25.079]  Nobody pays for these.
[01:42:25.099 --> 01:42:26.520]  They got to get money from you somehow.
[01:42:26.841 --> 01:42:28.282]  So they're selling your data.
[01:42:28.302 --> 01:42:35.408]  I mean, and that's that's the big hit that I think you can go after these people on is, you know, but but here's the king, too.
[01:42:35.488 --> 01:42:39.512]  It's like this is all about stopping Trump from getting reelected.
[01:42:39.532 --> 01:42:47.079]  This is like if all the rideshare applications said, OK, we're going to give free rides to people who want to go to the polls unless they're voting Trump.
[01:42:48.015 --> 01:42:50.416]  I mean, that's basically what social media is saying.
[01:42:50.456 --> 01:42:54.659]  Like, we're going to allow you to engage in speech, but only if you're anti-Trump.
[01:42:54.679 --> 01:42:56.620]  Dan Lyman from EuropeWars.com.
[01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:57.380]  Always great work.
[01:42:57.701 --> 01:42:59.802]  Go to EuropeWars.com to follow his great work.
[01:43:02.555 --> 01:43:05.197]  I'm gonna grow a magnificent pair of breasts.
[01:43:06.117 --> 01:43:08.819]  I'm going to transition into a woman.
[01:43:09.219 --> 01:43:09.899]  It'll be great!
[01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:22.827]  You should crawl back into your mother's rancid womb, gestate for a few more hours, slime back out, and then learn something about not being an entitled, white, piece of s***!
[01:43:22.847 --> 01:43:24.068]  This is Trump, people!
[01:43:24.848 --> 01:43:26.230]  When the rubber meets the road?
[01:43:26.971 --> 01:43:27.471]  Pussies!
[01:43:27.531 --> 01:43:28.813]  Yeah, you're a f***ing idiot.
[01:43:28.833 --> 01:43:29.774]  F*** you, capitalism!
[01:43:29.794 --> 01:43:30.995]  F*** you, f***ing president!
[01:43:31.275 --> 01:43:33.438]  He's a racist, stupid piece of s***!
[01:43:33.838 --> 01:43:37.542]  If you guys are working for Alex Jones, you're working for a murderer!
[01:43:37.682 --> 01:43:39.784]  Alex Jones is an a**hole.
[01:43:40.005 --> 01:43:42.387]  Danfoe Wards is fake news!
[01:43:45.728 --> 01:43:46.649]  I got a chair going.
[01:43:46.829 --> 01:43:51.831]  If you had to choose one prominent person to be banned next, who would you choose?
[01:43:52.272 --> 01:43:53.012]  You.
[01:43:53.052 --> 01:43:55.093]  Give me my money back.
[01:43:55.113 --> 01:43:56.754]  Excuse me, sir.
[01:43:56.854 --> 01:43:58.095]  Excuse me, it's ma'am.
[01:43:58.235 --> 01:44:00.316]  This is what's happening to the men in our country.
[01:44:00.396 --> 01:44:01.657]  Where are the men?
[01:44:01.677 --> 01:44:03.137]  Stop touching my stuff.
[01:44:03.197 --> 01:44:04.218]  I'm backing away.
[01:44:04.318 --> 01:44:04.938]  Stop.
[01:44:05.198 --> 01:44:06.339]  Relax, that tells me everything.
[01:44:06.359 --> 01:44:06.979]  Dude, stop!
[01:44:09.542 --> 01:44:11.846]  Why are you doing that?
[01:44:12.006 --> 01:44:13.769]  Get the f***ing stuff in and don't film me!
[01:44:13.789 --> 01:44:14.570]  You're not allowed!
[01:44:14.610 --> 01:44:15.271]  You can't use it!
[01:44:19.075 --> 01:44:20.435]  Please do not touch me.
[01:44:20.455 --> 01:44:21.876]  Please do not touch me.
[01:44:22.176 --> 01:44:23.136]  Once again, it's Mayer.
[01:44:23.396 --> 01:44:25.277]  Mayer, she said both of you guys.
[01:44:25.337 --> 01:44:27.577]  Right beforehand, you f***ing said, sir!
[01:44:27.697 --> 01:44:30.078]  Trump supporters are pussies!
[01:44:30.118 --> 01:44:30.918]  Pussies!
[01:44:31.038 --> 01:44:32.779]  Motherf***ing pussies!
[01:44:32.859 --> 01:44:33.439]  Motherf***er!
[01:44:33.459 --> 01:44:34.319]  Take it outside!
[01:44:34.919 --> 01:44:40.181]  If you don't call me, sir, again, I will show you who the f*** you, sir!
[01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:42.321]  Motherf***er!
[01:44:42.981 --> 01:44:44.502]  Get the f*** out of my face!
[01:44:44.562 --> 01:44:45.722]  Go home!
[01:44:45.742 --> 01:44:46.522]  Go home!
[01:44:46.863 --> 01:44:47.383]  Go home!
[01:44:47.483 --> 01:44:48.603]  What's your f***ing problem?
[01:44:50.285 --> 01:44:50.906]  Film it, bro.
[01:44:50.966 --> 01:44:51.606]  Film it.
[01:44:51.646 --> 01:44:56.029]  Yeah, I'm filming it.
[01:44:56.089 --> 01:44:57.590]  What the f*** did you do to me?
[01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:58.870]  Watch this.
[01:44:59.050 --> 01:45:00.091]  Did you farted at me?
[01:45:00.171 --> 01:45:05.494]  Get the hell out of here!
[01:45:05.754 --> 01:45:08.216]  Get these people the hell out of here right now!
[01:45:08.456 --> 01:45:09.737]  F*** off!
[01:45:09.797 --> 01:45:11.578]  I don't give a f***!
[01:45:12.398 --> 01:45:14.419]  Get out!
[01:45:14.499 --> 01:45:14.940]  Oh, s***!
[01:45:24.861 --> 01:45:25.226]  Wee!
[01:45:44.512 --> 01:45:51.998]  Yeah, I really appreciate you, and it's an honor to talk to you, and I do, before I start, I also wanted to do a plug for a couple of your products that I really love.
[01:45:52.058 --> 01:45:52.719]  Changed my life.
[01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:55.221]  The DNA Force is one, and X2.
[01:45:55.261 --> 01:45:57.002]  Yeah, I do a lot of construction.
[01:45:57.182 --> 01:46:04.548]  Using the tools that you're using, it just really wreaks havoc on your body, and I had three of my fingers starting to go numb, and I didn't think there was anything going to work on it.
[01:46:06.188 --> 01:46:11.310]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:18.852]  I mean, we want to sell you stuff that works.
[01:46:18.892 --> 01:46:25.454]  You want to order it again, but PQQ CoQ10 has been proven to make telomeres last longer, to make nerves regrow.
[01:46:25.594 --> 01:46:27.775]  It really is an amazing product for anybody above 40.
[01:46:28.015 --> 01:46:31.136]  Young people can take it as well, but yes, DNA Force Plus is amazing.
[01:46:31.156 --> 01:46:32.256]  What did you think of the X2?
[01:46:32.856 --> 01:46:33.897]  I love that too.
[01:46:34.117 --> 01:46:37.960]  After a few months of being on that, I felt like I wasn't searching for words.
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:47.026]  There was a time in my life where I felt like, man, I don't know if I'm just too exhausted or what, but you feel like you want to get in a conversation and you're pausing and you can't find the word to say.
[01:46:47.166 --> 01:46:50.288]  And I swear, man, that X2 really helps with cognition.
[01:46:50.328 --> 01:46:53.090]  Well, that's because the synapses in the brain operate off of it.
[01:46:53.130 --> 01:46:53.831]  It's electrochemical.
[01:46:53.851 --> 01:46:54.631]  You're absolutely right.
[01:46:54.671 --> 01:46:58.374]  When I forget to take X2 every couple of days, sometimes I forget for like a week because I get busy.
[01:46:58.494 --> 01:47:01.036]  Then I feel it and I take it, and it really is amazing.
[01:47:01.116 --> 01:47:02.237]  So thank you for the support, brother.
[01:47:06.914 --> 01:47:09.676]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:10.517 --> 01:47:22.205]  You may be an ambassador to England or France
[01:47:35.405 --> 01:47:36.326]  Alright.
[01:47:36.386 --> 01:47:41.110]  Kellen McBreen has the story at InfoWars.com.
[01:47:41.130 --> 01:47:44.073]  This just happened, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:44.233 --> 01:47:45.234]  All you gotta do is...
[01:48:03.493 --> 01:48:04.394]  Look around, folks.
[01:48:04.454 --> 01:48:05.094]  Pick your head up.
[01:48:06.075 --> 01:48:06.615]  Look around.
[01:48:07.316 --> 01:48:09.237]  It's not too hard to see what's going on right now.
[01:48:10.978 --> 01:48:18.243]  You've got a bunch of demon-possessed people that don't even realize it gnashing out against humanity.
[01:48:19.644 --> 01:48:25.087]  And then you have the leaders of the Democrat Party that get their energy from the devil.
[01:48:26.028 --> 01:48:29.130]  They're now losing that energy as the devil is waning now.
[01:48:31.011 --> 01:48:31.392]  And so,
[01:48:32.648 --> 01:48:34.890]  The story at Infowars.com from Cullen McBreen.
[01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:38.652]  Disoriented Democrat Jerry Nadler nearly passes out during presser.
[01:48:38.672 --> 01:48:40.433]  I mean, he really does pass out.
[01:48:42.294 --> 01:48:43.555]  And he's kind of nodding his head.
[01:48:43.575 --> 01:48:44.396]  He's clearly ill.
[01:48:45.977 --> 01:48:50.220]  And look, I'm not here celebrating the fact that Jerry Nadler almost died on camera today.
[01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:53.182]  But this is a corrupt Democrat.
[01:48:53.742 --> 01:48:54.603]  This is a dirtbag.
[01:48:54.643 --> 01:48:55.483]  This is a scumbag.
[01:48:56.644 --> 01:49:00.767]  And so... I wish him the best.
[01:49:02.762 --> 01:49:03.442]  In God's plan.
[01:49:08.084 --> 01:49:14.225]  But we thought it was Nancy Pelosi that would be the one that passed out drunk on a podium.
[01:49:14.866 --> 01:49:18.127]  It ended up being the Rapscallion Jerry Nadler.
[01:49:18.447 --> 01:49:21.168]  Here is the video that just broke.
[01:49:21.928 --> 01:49:24.068]  Jerry Nadler passes out.
[01:49:24.248 --> 01:49:25.209]  He's clearly ill.
[01:49:25.309 --> 01:49:28.730]  I don't know what's going on in the middle of a Democrat press conference.
[01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:32.191]  I said one time, who's in charge here?
[01:49:32.927 --> 01:49:36.029]  And I think the congressman's right about that fact.
[01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.830]  Jerry, you want some?
[01:49:38.291 --> 01:49:39.011]  Yeah, I got some.
[01:49:39.351 --> 01:49:39.952]  Here, Jerry.
[01:49:41.253 --> 01:49:41.693]  Take a drink.
[01:49:42.513 --> 01:49:43.994]  You're a little dehydrated, brother.
[01:49:45.035 --> 01:49:50.519]  Crowded room full of people, and he is just gone.
[01:49:50.559 --> 01:49:55.282]  Here's bundling Pelosi, fried drunk, high on pills, maybe both.
[01:49:55.902 --> 01:50:00.746]  He started sending signals to US, Mexico, Canada,
[01:50:02.592 --> 01:50:04.013]  That's not the accurate character.
[01:50:04.133 --> 01:50:06.914]  Some people call it AFTA-NAFTA, some call it NAFTA 2.0.
[01:50:07.475 --> 01:50:11.777]  We're working together to make past that.
[01:50:12.257 --> 01:50:16.140]  You want to take a drink of this to give yourself some?
[01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:18.181]  How you feel, man?
[01:50:18.221 --> 01:50:19.221]  Nadler is not well.
[01:50:19.441 --> 01:50:21.823]  He is not well.
[01:50:21.863 --> 01:50:22.943]  He can't even see his back.
[01:50:27.967 --> 01:50:29.088]  How you feel, ma'am?
[01:50:29.208 --> 01:50:29.428]  Oh, boy.
[01:50:29.888 --> 01:50:30.289]  You feel okay?
[01:50:30.349 --> 01:50:31.569]  Mm-hmm.
[01:50:31.769 --> 01:50:36.312]  Not... If we... We're... We're the fat... There's three things.
[01:50:36.492 --> 01:50:37.253]  There's three things.
[01:50:37.413 --> 01:50:38.173]  There's three things.
[01:50:38.274 --> 01:50:39.114]  There's three things.
[01:50:39.314 --> 01:50:40.715]  We're very busy people.
[01:50:41.496 --> 01:50:43.617]  I said one time, who's in charge here?
[01:50:45.898 --> 01:50:46.299]  You are, Nan.
[01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:54.714]  Look, again, you know, I don't get pleasure out of the fact that Jerry Nadler looks like he just had, like, a stroke or something.
[01:50:54.734 --> 01:50:55.615]  That's serious.
[01:50:55.855 --> 01:50:58.016]  I feel bad for him as a person and for his family.
[01:50:59.257 --> 01:51:07.062]  But, you know, sometimes the world has a funny way, universe
[01:51:08.294 --> 01:51:10.537]  Universal Karma has a funny way of coming back to you.
[01:51:11.237 --> 01:51:17.945]  So you have all these Democrats saying Trump is unfit, Trump is unhealthy, Trump can't sit up straight, Trump's sleepy, he's this, he's that.
[01:51:18.045 --> 01:51:19.106]  No, that's the Democrats.
[01:51:19.347 --> 01:51:22.410]  That's Joe Biden falling asleep before he has speeches.
[01:51:22.650 --> 01:51:24.352]  That's Jerry Nadler passing out.
[01:51:24.473 --> 01:51:28.557]  It looks like having a serious health problem in the middle of a Democrat press conference.
[01:51:29.494 --> 01:51:34.337]  Nancy Pelosi fumbling and bumbling through multiple press conferences every day like a drunkard.
[01:51:34.877 --> 01:51:42.401]  That's Hillary Clinton literally passing out and had to be hucked into a car because she was like a wet noodle.
[01:51:42.741 --> 01:51:45.983]  And then they say, oh, she just had a spout of pneumonia.
[01:51:46.383 --> 01:51:47.184]  She got cold.
[01:51:47.924 --> 01:51:50.705]  It was like 80 degrees in New York that day, she had a jacket on.
[01:51:50.885 --> 01:51:53.565]  She comes out the next day and hugs a child.
[01:51:54.185 --> 01:51:54.485]  Really?
[01:51:54.525 --> 01:51:56.566]  She had a pneumonia and then she went out and hugged a child?
[01:51:57.026 --> 01:52:00.187]  While she's wearing her seizure glasses.
[01:52:02.147 --> 01:52:08.448]  And so, this is literally the party of sickly, ill, deranged people.
[01:52:08.508 --> 01:52:10.389]  The Democrat party, the Nancy Pelosi's.
[01:52:14.450 --> 01:52:15.930]  And, what do they do?
[01:52:17.256 --> 01:52:27.204]  They point the finger at Trump, who's got more energy than all of them combined.
[01:52:27.525 --> 01:52:35.612]  In fact, if you look at most presidents, when they get in office and then after they've been in office for a while, they usually age pretty quickly and not so well.
[01:52:36.072 --> 01:52:42.898]  This president, as Maxine Waters says, has, he's like, he's glowing!
[01:52:42.918 --> 01:52:45.280]  It's like he's gotten younger!
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:48.120]  And then what do you have?
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:59.123]  They say he's unfit, he's unhealthy, Jerry Nadler passes out, Hillary Clinton falls down, Nancy Pelosi, if she's not drunk, then there's seriously something wrong with her.
[01:53:00.604 --> 01:53:02.204]  So, there you go folks.
[01:53:04.005 --> 01:53:05.585]  Very interesting right there.
[01:53:06.706 --> 01:53:07.106]  Alright.
[01:53:08.506 --> 01:53:09.547]  Do we have these videos ready?
[01:53:09.567 --> 01:53:10.607]  I'm not sure how long they are.
[01:53:13.066 --> 01:53:14.526]  From Paul Joseph Watson, U.S.
[01:53:14.586 --> 01:53:17.547]  Cardinal says Islam attempting to take over the West.
[01:53:18.567 --> 01:53:20.447]  You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see what's happened.
[01:53:20.868 --> 01:53:21.088]  U.S.
[01:53:21.128 --> 01:53:28.969]  Cardinal Raymond Burke says that resisting large-scale immigration from Muslim countries is the responsible exercise of one's patriotism.
[01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:38.531]  And so, here is Cardinal Burke on large-scale Muslim immigration.
[01:53:39.889 --> 01:53:41.890]  Since I don't dispense papal blessings, I won't
[01:53:56.617 --> 01:54:12.117]  I think the fundamental question here is someone who resists large-scale Muslim immigration committing an immoral act and therefore should be, let's say, denied Holy Communion or in some way
[01:54:13.319 --> 01:54:14.199]  We're good to go.
[01:54:35.871 --> 01:54:36.191]  I don't
[01:54:55.004 --> 01:54:58.985]  It's a very interesting book written called No Go Zones, which records
[01:55:21.693 --> 01:55:21.913]  Okay.
[01:55:51.813 --> 01:55:57.776]  So there's Cardinal Raymond Burke, actually had the opportunity to meet him when he served in the Archdiocese of St.
[01:55:57.796 --> 01:55:58.397]  Louis from 2004 to 2008.
[01:56:19.781 --> 01:56:24.582]  So, it's glad to see that not everyone from the Catholic Church is pro-globalism.
[01:56:26.102 --> 01:56:29.723]  And so, you won't hear that from the Pope, and you kind of heard him joking about it.
[01:56:30.363 --> 01:56:42.786]  And you're starting to actually see signs inside of the ministry now that are kind of going against the Pope, who's clearly open borders, one world government, globalist.
[01:56:43.928 --> 01:56:50.451]  And so we've got another video of another Cardinal coming up in the next hour warning of the same thing.
[01:56:50.491 --> 01:56:54.093]  Vatican Cardinal warns West will disappear because of mass migration.
[01:56:54.173 --> 01:56:56.755]  But it's already happening.
[01:56:58.255 --> 01:57:00.637]  It's already happening.
[01:57:03.458 --> 01:57:10.782]  I said this yesterday and the only chance there is to stop it from happening is the Brexit.
[01:57:10.822 --> 01:57:12.943]  But if they don't
[01:57:14.002 --> 01:57:14.482]  I don't know.
[01:57:35.575 --> 01:57:48.061]  The European Union will have wide open borders, Islam will move in, it'll take over Europe, turn it into the Middle East, and that'll be it for Europe.
[01:57:49.022 --> 01:57:50.822]  So, they have a choice to make right now.
[01:57:52.483 --> 01:57:57.206]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted, I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:57:57.566 --> 01:58:03.329]  Banning people, they're dictating the opinions that everyone on the platform is allowed to have.
[01:58:07.515 --> 01:58:11.676]  I'm a conservative Jew, so I guess that makes me such a dangerous person.
[01:58:14.717 --> 01:58:16.877]  Spreading articles, spreading videos, spreading links.
[01:58:16.897 --> 01:58:17.697]  You're going to get demonized.
[01:58:17.717 --> 01:58:18.437]  You're going to get attacked.
[01:58:18.738 --> 01:58:22.138]  You're going to get hate.
[01:58:22.158 --> 01:58:25.239]  It's going to do something terrible like help Trump get re-elected.
[01:58:25.259 --> 01:58:28.620]  That's really what all this is about.
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:33.741]  They say that they deem our content and our brand unsafe.
[01:58:36.668 --> 01:58:39.670]  Is the right to be, do, and say whatever you want.
[01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:43.613]  It's about freedom of expression.
[01:58:43.713 --> 01:58:44.373]  I'm a journalist.
[01:58:44.433 --> 01:58:50.717]  I'm a left not interested in telling the truth about me because I don't fit the stereotype.
[01:58:50.817 --> 01:58:54.219]  They can say whatever they think and I respect their constitutional right to do it.
[01:58:54.239 --> 01:58:55.500]  I hope they respect my...
[01:59:13.667 --> 01:59:17.636]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.

[01:59:54.935 --> 02:00:00.881]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.307 --> 02:00:08.809]  It's mind control.
[02:00:08.949 --> 02:00:10.751]  Mind control.
[02:00:10.971 --> 02:00:14.635]  Corruption of your thoughts.
[02:00:14.675 --> 02:00:16.177]  Destruction of your soul.
[02:00:23.490 --> 02:00:26.592]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have the video.
[02:00:26.612 --> 02:00:31.955]  This is horrifying, shocking stuff that we're about to air for you here.
[02:00:32.035 --> 02:00:49.124]  But two of the top Democrats that criticized Trump for his mental health and his fitness, Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler, you've got Pelosi either drunkenly babbling or she's seriously mentally ill during a press conference.
[02:00:49.244 --> 02:00:50.905]  And then Nadler today, I mean,
[02:00:51.874 --> 02:00:52.775]  We try not to joke.
[02:00:52.855 --> 02:00:56.778]  I mean, it looks like he may have had a stroke or something today during a press conference.
[02:00:57.338 --> 02:01:05.564]  So, uh, just look at the Democrats who claim Trump is mentally unfit, who can't even get through a press conference.
[02:01:06.725 --> 02:01:08.886]  I said one time, who's in charge here?
[02:01:09.587 --> 02:01:12.669]  And I think the congressman's right about that fact.
[02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:14.490]  Jerry, you want some?
[02:01:14.971 --> 02:01:15.671]  Yeah, I got some.
[02:01:16.211 --> 02:01:16.632]  Here, Jerry.
[02:01:17.733 --> 02:01:18.333]  Take a drink.
[02:01:19.194 --> 02:01:20.595]  You look a little dehydrated, brother.
[02:01:21.929 --> 02:01:23.371]  You seem a little dehydrated.
[02:01:23.411 --> 02:01:23.892]  Are you okay?
[02:01:23.912 --> 02:01:32.083]  It took a little longer on the floor than I had anticipated in the custody of the Border Patrol.
[02:01:32.684 --> 02:01:36.730]  Everyone started sending signals.
[02:01:36.910 --> 02:01:38.532]  The US, Mexico, Canada.
[02:01:40.273 --> 02:01:45.136]  If that's not the accurate... Some people call it AFTA-NAFTA, some call it NAFTA 2.0.
[02:01:45.276 --> 02:01:49.559]  We're working together to pass that.
[02:01:49.599 --> 02:01:51.120]  You seem a little dehydrated.
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:53.081]  Are you okay?
[02:01:53.101 --> 02:01:53.601]  Oh boy.
[02:01:53.641 --> 02:01:54.962]  So here's Pelosi and Nadler.
[02:01:55.002 --> 02:01:57.824]  They can't even finish their thought at a press conference here.
[02:01:57.844 --> 02:01:58.984]  They're fumbling and bumbling.
[02:02:00.485 --> 02:02:04.449]  You wish they were drunk, but this is just the lack of brain power that they have.
[02:02:04.529 --> 02:02:06.491]  There's three things.
[02:02:06.531 --> 02:02:06.992]  Three things.
[02:02:07.372 --> 02:02:07.672]  Three things.
[02:02:07.712 --> 02:02:12.277]  You want to take a drink of this to give yourself some?
[02:02:12.297 --> 02:02:13.618]  How do you feel, ma'am?
[02:02:14.679 --> 02:02:16.040]  You feel okay?
[02:02:16.781 --> 02:02:17.922]  I'm okay.
[02:02:17.982 --> 02:02:19.504]  You all right?
[02:02:20.044 --> 02:02:22.667]  Okay, do you want to drink some of this and give you some?
[02:02:23.664 --> 02:02:29.367]  Now, folks, you wish that you were watching Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler drunk, unable to think.
[02:02:29.547 --> 02:02:32.688]  But the truth is, they just have no brain force.
[02:02:32.728 --> 02:02:48.075]  So, I want to just put out a message right now to the Democrats, because, look, your leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler, are struggling.

[02:03:53.014 --> 02:03:54.295]  You don't want to look like Nadler.
[02:03:54.635 --> 02:03:55.496]  You want to look sharp.
[02:03:55.636 --> 02:03:56.716]  You want your mind to be sharp.

[02:04:11.404 --> 02:04:12.085]  But, you know,
[02:04:14.070 --> 02:04:20.014]  I mean, if you watch these videos of Pelosi and Nadler, I mean, you would say those people are drunk.
[02:04:21.796 --> 02:04:23.497]  You'd say, okay, Pelosi's drunk.
[02:04:24.438 --> 02:04:25.258]  Nadler's drunk.
[02:04:25.318 --> 02:04:27.700]  I mean, he looks like he's passed out drunk at a party or something.
[02:04:28.161 --> 02:04:31.963]  Now, we're not told that they have major health problems.
[02:04:32.204 --> 02:04:32.844]  Maybe they do.
[02:04:33.525 --> 02:04:36.187]  Maybe Nancy Pelosi has some serious mental health problems.
[02:04:37.051 --> 02:04:40.913]  Maybe Jerry Nadler's having some serious health problems, because it looks that way.
[02:04:41.553 --> 02:04:50.276]  Either these people are dead drunk, or they're having serious, serious health problems, just like Hillary Clinton.
[02:04:50.556 --> 02:04:51.717]  Just like Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[02:04:51.917 --> 02:04:59.400]  So the Democrat Party is not only falling apart intellectually, literally the health of all of their leaders is deteriorating.
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:00.640]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:06.804 --> 02:05:09.845]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.

[02:06:17.328 --> 02:06:18.752]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.293 --> 02:06:22.321]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:46.454 --> 02:06:51.438]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show at Infowars.com slash show, the most banned broadcast in the world.
[02:06:52.558 --> 02:06:54.400]  Stefan Arnio is my guest.
[02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:56.421]  StefanArnio.com.
[02:06:56.861 --> 02:07:10.711]  His book Hard Times Strong Men.com is a book that highlights masculinity and how important it is to civilization, which of course is why they want it demonized and removed, unless of course you're a
[02:07:11.932 --> 02:07:16.636]  A female that wants to be a male, then it's all good to go.
[02:07:17.156 --> 02:07:18.357]  So, Stefan joins me.
[02:07:18.957 --> 02:07:23.300]  What is the purpose of your book, Hard Times Create Strong Men?
[02:07:24.701 --> 02:07:28.504]  So, Owen, about a year and a half ago, I was in the jungle fasting.
[02:07:29.064 --> 02:07:30.405]  Just water, no food.
[02:07:31.026 --> 02:07:35.189]  I came home to my business with about eight employees at the time.
[02:07:35.877 --> 02:07:44.630]  And the young men, 20 years old, 21, 22 years old, they said, you're mean, I don't like you, I don't like working here, this isn't my dream, all these kind of effeminate...
[02:07:45.445 --> 02:07:47.045]  Girl complaints coming from these young men.
[02:07:47.065 --> 02:07:48.226]  And I said, what's wrong with these young men?
[02:07:48.266 --> 02:07:51.527]  So I sat them down and I had a six hour how to be a man talk over the week.
[02:07:52.087 --> 02:07:53.007]  And I got tired of doing that.
[02:07:53.047 --> 02:07:57.168]  So I started writing down how to be a man in a book, which became hard times create strong men.
[02:07:57.188 --> 02:07:58.948]  And I realized these young men don't have fathers.
[02:07:59.229 --> 02:08:00.389]  They don't have male influence.
[02:08:00.989 --> 02:08:05.310]  And our young men have essentially turned into badly behaved teenage girls.
[02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:12.732]  So in the book, I write about what is a man in money, sex, religion, politics, in regards to history and how strong men used to be.
[02:08:14.025 --> 02:08:28.277]  Well and you know that's an interesting take because I see, I mean you know what they do is they sit here and they try to make everything sexist if you point out the differences between men and women but you know I look at men
[02:08:29.875 --> 02:08:42.022]  As a man, and I hear what you're saying, and I'm saying, yeah, men that give me excuses instead of action, you know, that's not the type of men that build society, that's not the type of men that build anything, really.
[02:08:42.622 --> 02:08:53.148]  And so, but that's the type of men that they want, and that's why they run to the state, or that's why they run to AI, or that's why, heck, they run to their computer instead of, you know, trying to meet a woman.
[02:08:53.248 --> 02:08:54.388]  I think you know where I'm going with this.
[02:08:55.009 --> 02:08:57.110]  So, I mean, do you think that just
[02:08:57.970 --> 02:09:03.800]  What do you think is behind kind of the... ...unmasculinity of men?
[02:09:05.984 --> 02:09:06.765]  Well, it's very simple.
[02:09:06.825 --> 02:09:12.769]  I mean, the demasculization of men, I think, started in the 1960s and it was with the rise of feminism.
[02:09:13.349 --> 02:09:15.610]  And you had the Soviets in the Cold War.
[02:09:16.271 --> 02:09:22.435]  They sent over their agents and their propaganda to bring communism, atheism and feminism over.
[02:09:22.535 --> 02:09:34.343]  And that's the opposite of what the United States has been for a long time and made the USA the greatest country in the world, which was capitalism, gender differences and a Judeo-Christian tradition.
[02:09:34.363 --> 02:09:35.884]  So they've subverted the values
[02:09:36.485 --> 02:09:36.745]  We're good.
[02:09:47.746 --> 02:09:59.390]  And now these men have been weakened, they've been homogenized, and the cycles of history go hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times.
[02:09:59.430 --> 02:10:07.433]  And we're going into that part of the cycle where the men are weak, the culture is falling apart, the culture is built with the men, and it falls with the men.
[02:10:07.513 --> 02:10:11.674]  So right now we're, oh there you got the soy boys up on the screen, I mean we're at this point where
[02:10:12.154 --> 02:10:21.600]  The good times have created weak men, and coming in 2020, this is the point in the cycle, it's an 80-year cycle, where hard times are coming, and we're going to need those strong men more than ever before.
[02:10:23.301 --> 02:10:30.005]  Well, and they've blurred the lines of what, you know, a man and a woman are meant to be, because they just call it sexist.
[02:10:31.106 --> 02:10:38.070]  And, you know, it's funny to me because these people, they don't even really follow their own logic.
[02:10:38.850 --> 02:10:40.551]  There's this thing called a two-spirit.
[02:10:40.651 --> 02:10:41.712]  Are you familiar with the two-spirit?
[02:10:42.662 --> 02:10:48.566]  Well, I've got the 63 genders, the official genders in my book, and like, it just goes on and on.
[02:10:48.586 --> 02:10:55.310]  Like, when I was reading the audiobook, I had to stop three times because I was laughing so hard at the 63, you know, mutant genders out there.
[02:10:55.330 --> 02:11:02.034]  And like, I don't want to hate on people, but that's just pure insanity, and those people would be in the mental institution if it was, you know, 50 years ago.
[02:11:02.515 --> 02:11:05.036]  Oh, well, yeah, but I figured out how we can break this matrix.
[02:11:05.096 --> 02:11:07.498]  So here's what somebody can do.
[02:11:08.687 --> 02:11:13.892]  One of like the biggest, I'm dead serious, if we can destroy this whole thing with one man.
[02:11:15.314 --> 02:11:29.868]  The biggest bodybuilder in the world that's a man who has all the strongman records, needs to have all the records for the strongman, and then declare he's a woman, break every female lifting record, and then declare he's a man again, and retire from being a woman.
[02:11:29.908 --> 02:11:30.629]  He's a two-spirit.
[02:11:31.169 --> 02:11:32.470]  And so, what are you gonna do?
[02:11:32.530 --> 02:11:33.850]  I mean, this is what they promote.
[02:11:34.431 --> 02:11:35.571]  This is what they practice.
[02:11:35.591 --> 02:11:36.992]  This is what they say is normal behavior.
[02:11:37.012 --> 02:11:37.992]  So, that's all you gotta do.
[02:11:38.012 --> 02:11:42.154]  You just have to act out the behavior they claim is normal to show how insane it is.
[02:11:42.354 --> 02:11:43.275]  So, I'm dead serious.
[02:11:43.315 --> 02:11:50.738]  You know, there's a guy, Zuby, who got real... He was a rapper, but he got real famous after he faked being a woman and did a deadlift record.
[02:11:50.778 --> 02:11:51.738]  Or, excuse me, I'm sexist.
[02:11:51.758 --> 02:11:52.379]  He is a woman.
[02:11:52.859 --> 02:11:56.621]  Somebody needs to claim to be a two-spirit, a man that holds all...
[02:11:57.421 --> 02:12:03.047]  Uh, weightlifting records, and then shift and be a woman, break every weightlifting- I mean, literally, every one.
[02:12:03.368 --> 02:12:12.217]  Rewrite the whole book on women's weightlifting, so it's just you, and keep your male name, and then just say, no, I'm a two-spirit, and then go back to lifting as a man.
[02:12:12.578 --> 02:12:13.379]  What are they gonna do then?
[02:12:13.419 --> 02:12:16.162]  Are they gonna re- are they gonna admit that their whole ideology is fake?
[02:12:17.902 --> 02:12:18.823]  We should get that going.
[02:12:18.863 --> 02:12:20.364]  I mean, it is a fake ideology.
[02:12:20.384 --> 02:12:23.266]  It's subjectivism versus objectism.
[02:12:23.346 --> 02:12:27.009]  And, you know, we have men as men and we have women as women.
[02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:33.374]  And that's what built this entire Western free society is objectivism and men are men and women are women.
[02:12:33.735 --> 02:12:36.217]  And now when you make everybody the same, the whole thing just loses meaning.
[02:12:36.237 --> 02:12:37.377]  So I love what you're saying there, Owen.
[02:12:37.417 --> 02:12:38.478]  I think we should do it.
[02:12:38.498 --> 02:12:40.160]  Let's find a guy and get that going right now.
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:47.805]  Did you hear about the MMA fighter, biological man transitioned to woman that got in the ring with a woman and crushed her skull?
[02:12:49.586 --> 02:12:57.552]  I didn't hear about that but I heard about a lot of different men wrestling women and beating them in running races and all sorts of races and I don't think there's any U.S.
[02:12:57.592 --> 02:12:58.873]  Navy SEALs as women, is there?
[02:13:00.561 --> 02:13:07.051]  There may have been one that passed the test, but they were thinking about changing the test so that they could perhaps get women to pass it.
[02:13:07.812 --> 02:13:10.416]  Hey, if a woman can pass the SEALS test, I believe that's the hardest one.
[02:13:11.238 --> 02:13:11.959]  More power to them.
[02:13:12.119 --> 02:13:13.661]  But that's not even what this is about, because
[02:13:15.404 --> 02:13:17.446]  I don't even know what this is about.
[02:13:17.486 --> 02:13:21.049]  It's literally just about destroying human roles is really what it's about.
[02:13:21.069 --> 02:13:24.892]  I mean, it's insane to say you can be a man and a woman on the same day.
[02:13:24.912 --> 02:13:29.997]  I mean, that's literally insane, but it's like we have to practice this to show them how insane it is.
[02:13:30.017 --> 02:13:37.283]  Like, yeah, all these men should just start playing women's rugby and just join one team and crush their skulls and say, what?
[02:13:37.364 --> 02:13:37.844]  We're women.
[02:13:37.984 --> 02:13:38.645]  What's wrong with this?
[02:13:40.427 --> 02:13:55.554]  Well, it really is about power and control because when you can take your men, you know, these dangerous young men that could rise up and start a revolution, you feminize them and pump them full of soy and give them porno and video games and all these distractions and take away God and take away religion.
[02:13:56.034 --> 02:13:57.755]  Well, the viral video was a guy
[02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:28.873]  Who, you've probably seen it, he's definitely a soy boy and he kind of sticks his tongue out and he's got a purple hood on and he does like a 360 kick to a woman.
[02:14:28.913 --> 02:14:31.774]  He kicks a woman because she's pro-life.
[02:14:33.195 --> 02:14:38.496]  And recently, and he actually regrets it, but recently the video kind of resurfaced and went viral.
[02:14:38.516 --> 02:14:41.477]  Someone tweeted out, I still stand with this king.
[02:14:42.137 --> 02:14:42.818]  This king.
[02:14:42.938 --> 02:14:43.918]  And I'm looking at it and I'm like,
[02:14:45.353 --> 02:14:45.894]  Let me tell you something.
[02:14:46.715 --> 02:14:57.607]  That individual right there, the loins of that individual, will never be a king, have never been a king, and could never even hold any position of earned power.
[02:14:58.228 --> 02:14:59.430]  And so it's just the funniest thing.
[02:14:59.470 --> 02:15:03.174]  They take the weakest, most pathetic men, and they say, that's a king.
[02:15:03.494 --> 02:15:05.297]  But in the old, like,
[02:15:05.837 --> 02:15:09.099]  Old kings used to ride into battle on the front line.
[02:15:09.379 --> 02:15:11.139]  Like, that's how they became king.
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:13.560]  That little sucker would never be a king.
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:16.722]  He'd be on the back line picking up the rest of their extrament.
[02:15:18.706 --> 02:15:20.686]  Well, this is what the cycles of history are.
[02:15:20.706 --> 02:15:27.448]  I mean, we're going from good times create weak men since 2000 to 2020, and then we're going to go back into hard times create strong men.
[02:15:27.468 --> 02:15:27.848]  And you know what?
[02:15:27.888 --> 02:15:32.609]  Oh, and I think there's hope, because we will have a pretty hard event coming up, I think, in 2020.
[02:15:32.669 --> 02:15:36.570]  Between 2020 and 2026, I think there's going to be a pretty hard time happening.
[02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:42.351]  And I think it's going to snap a lot of these guys out of this, and I think we're going to throw a lot of this nonsense away at some point.
[02:15:42.791 --> 02:15:45.192]  Because it just can't last on its own in nature.
[02:15:45.312 --> 02:15:47.614]  So, hard times do create strong men.
[02:15:47.634 --> 02:16:00.861]  Alright, if you're a, if you are a competitive weightlifter and you hold world records as a male weightlifter, please just, just go to spirit, break every women's weightlifting record just to show how insane it is.
[02:16:03.100 --> 02:16:09.485]  Global controllers are very smart in some ways, very ignorant in others, but they understand the power of archetypes.
[02:16:10.726 --> 02:16:18.452]  And I never knew when I started out on my quest 25 years ago to restore the American Republic that I would end up being a major leader in it.
[02:16:19.052 --> 02:16:24.777]  I just simply thought I'd be one more voice calling on the people to stand up and get involved in their own destinies.
[02:16:26.618 --> 02:16:27.339]  But it became clear
[02:16:28.993 --> 02:16:35.654]  Eight, nine years ago, even in Newsweek and Time Magazine, they said, Alex Jones is the mad prophet of the Tea Party.
[02:16:36.175 --> 02:16:39.415]  In the wilderness, he must be stopped.
[02:16:40.296 --> 02:16:45.877]  And all these years later, I realized that I didn't invent the ideas I'm promoting.
[02:16:47.017 --> 02:16:55.539]  I'm simply promoting free market, Renaissance, Americana, and ideas that are
[02:16:57.210 --> 02:17:03.455]  Diametrically opposed to authoritarian systems, whether they be fascist, communist, or socialist.
[02:17:05.797 --> 02:17:14.704]  But nevertheless, Infowars has been chosen by the enemy as the symbol of Americana, as the card.
[02:17:15.845 --> 02:17:24.152]  And if they can demonize it, if they can lie about it, and if they can destroy it, they believe they can demoralize you and make you give up.
[02:17:24.893 --> 02:17:25.053]  So,
[02:17:26.155 --> 02:17:28.498]  Please hold InfoWars up.
[02:17:29.118 --> 02:17:29.859]  Please promote it.
[02:17:29.979 --> 02:17:30.680]  Please support it.
[02:17:31.541 --> 02:17:34.184]  I personally hope that we can survive this.
[02:17:35.466 --> 02:17:36.287]  But even if we don't...
[02:17:37.489 --> 02:17:47.716]  Don't think a defeat of an individual or an organization is an expression of who you are, because you are the listeners and viewers that actually made InfoWars the success it is.
[02:17:48.397 --> 02:17:59.185]  Yes, I selfishly want to continue on with the future, but I don't want you to ever think that if I'm set up, killed, destroyed, imprisoned, lied about with their fake narratives,
[02:18:00.421 --> 02:18:01.141]  That we're losers.
[02:18:01.981 --> 02:18:04.502]  We did the right thing and told the truth and we've already changed the world.
[02:18:05.122 --> 02:18:06.923]  So you need to continue on.
[02:18:07.763 --> 02:18:08.863]  But we're at that fork in the road.
[02:18:09.523 --> 02:18:13.844]  Will Infowars continue on to fight more battles and win more battles thanks to your support?
[02:18:14.385 --> 02:18:15.725]  Or will we be destroyed?
[02:18:16.285 --> 02:18:18.726]  And then you have to move on and not be demoralized.
[02:18:19.366 --> 02:18:19.946]  We're at that point.
[02:18:21.471 --> 02:18:22.132]  It's financial.
[02:18:22.632 --> 02:18:25.555]  At the end of the day, money talks, BS walks.
[02:18:26.295 --> 02:18:30.539]  Funding allows us to operate and expand and defeat the enemy.
[02:18:31.259 --> 02:18:34.002]  Not having money shuts us down and we're defeated.
[02:18:34.022 --> 02:18:37.144]  And once we've been silenced, the enemy can lie about us all they want.
[02:18:37.845 --> 02:18:41.188]  We're running Memorial Day specials right through next week.
[02:18:41.848 --> 02:18:43.229]  Some of the biggest sales we've ever done.

[02:18:49.895 --> 02:18:54.821]  Micro ZX instead of just a probiotic, it's anti-fungus, anti-candida mold for your guts.
[02:18:55.141 --> 02:18:55.582]  Amazing.
[02:18:55.942 --> 02:18:56.603]  Try it for yourself.
[02:18:56.623 --> 02:18:57.684]  60% off.

[02:19:14.625 --> 02:19:17.549]  There's a bunch of other specials as well, but we try to make it symbiotic.
[02:19:17.609 --> 02:19:21.815]  Great products at great prices that make your life better than funder operation.
[02:19:22.075 --> 02:19:25.300]  Whatever you do, commit now like you've already done.
[02:19:26.530 --> 02:19:32.252]  To take action, whether it's word of mouth, or praying for us, or buying the products, or all three, you've already changed the world.
[02:19:32.732 --> 02:19:47.135]  And I humbly come to you with respect, and thank you again for what you've done for myself, for my children, and for your children, and for all of our own destinies, because this is an incredible time in humanity at that fork in the road, or at that crossroads.
[02:19:47.756 --> 02:19:48.396]  But whatever you do,
[02:19:49.196 --> 02:19:50.338]  Never give in to the globalist.
[02:19:50.838 --> 02:19:52.220]  Never give in to your humanity.
[02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:53.942]  Never believe you're a piece of crap.
[02:19:54.442 --> 02:19:55.904]  Never believe that humanity sucks.
[02:19:56.385 --> 02:19:59.308]  Because that is a lie of the old serpent, Satan.
[02:20:06.356 --> 02:20:08.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:28.948 --> 02:20:30.250]  Stephan Arnio is my guest.
[02:20:30.270 --> 02:20:32.553]  His book, Hard Times, Strong Men.
[02:20:33.073 --> 02:20:34.475]  I love his foundational precept.
[02:20:34.715 --> 02:20:36.057]  Strong men create good times.
[02:20:36.217 --> 02:20:37.298]  Good times create weak men.
[02:20:37.418 --> 02:20:38.540]  Weak men create hard times.
[02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:40.182]  Hard times create strong men.
[02:20:40.202 --> 02:20:42.405]  And the cycle begins.
[02:20:45.148 --> 02:20:46.850]  And so, we're discussing...
[02:20:47.987 --> 02:20:53.050]  How masculinity has been under attack, and in many cases destroyed, in the West.
[02:20:53.670 --> 02:21:00.514]  You know, we recognize that here at InfoWars, and we know why this is going on.
[02:21:00.674 --> 02:21:07.698]  It's the media, it's the chemicals in the food and water, it's the pornography, it's all of it.
[02:21:08.278 --> 02:21:09.339]  It really is all of it.
[02:21:09.739 --> 02:21:16.223]  And you know, in fact, you know, I'll just say this because it's not said enough, and I understand why.
[02:21:17.475 --> 02:21:24.302]  And I'm not attacking the porn industry because actually there's actually a lot of good people that are woke and listen to InfoWars, believe it or not.
[02:21:24.682 --> 02:21:25.122]  Good people.
[02:21:26.984 --> 02:21:28.786]  And, you know, they're just making a living.
[02:21:30.816 --> 02:21:38.478]  Honestly, if there's young men listening to this, you need to just avoid pornography at all costs.
[02:21:38.838 --> 02:21:39.718]  Just avoid it.
[02:21:40.358 --> 02:21:41.639]  Do not masturbate.
[02:21:41.819 --> 02:21:42.539]  It's bad.
[02:21:43.239 --> 02:21:44.319]  It is bad for you.
[02:21:44.859 --> 02:21:46.380]  It destroys your masculinity.
[02:21:46.780 --> 02:21:48.660]  It destroys your testosterone levels.
[02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:54.282]  And it kills your instinct to procreate and to find a woman.
[02:21:54.702 --> 02:21:54.962]  Okay?
[02:21:55.842 --> 02:21:57.302]  And the science is out there.
[02:21:57.322 --> 02:21:58.943]  The numbers are out there.
[02:21:59.803 --> 02:22:00.223]  It's bad.
[02:22:01.633 --> 02:22:04.976]  Okay, now I'm not, again, I'm not saying you're saying you're bad if you do that.
[02:22:05.396 --> 02:22:16.464]  I'm just telling young men out there, you're handicapping your masculinity big time when you engage in pornography and watching pornography.
[02:22:16.784 --> 02:22:20.087]  It kills your masculinity, it kills your testosterone, it kills your drive.
[02:22:21.428 --> 02:22:25.971]  And that's just one aspect of society
[02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:27.821]  That's great.
[02:22:47.498 --> 02:22:50.320]  Other people have found this to be an incredible product, and it is.
[02:22:51.221 --> 02:22:55.124]  But I do take the Super Male Vitality from Infowarshore.com twice a day.
[02:22:55.344 --> 02:22:58.647]  Once in the morning, and then once in the evening before my workout.
[02:22:59.148 --> 02:23:02.791]  So, I highly recommend both of these products.
[02:23:02.891 --> 02:23:05.713]  Again, the Alpha Power, for me, it's too powerful.
[02:23:06.013 --> 02:23:08.836]  I don't necessarily need that much male vitality.
[02:23:08.996 --> 02:23:09.956]  I'll just put it to you that way.
[02:23:10.897 --> 02:23:13.618]  But the super male vitality, amazing.
[02:23:13.758 --> 02:23:14.718]  Infowarshore.com.
[02:23:14.778 --> 02:23:15.379]  It's 50% off.
[02:23:15.479 --> 02:23:16.419]  I take it twice a day.
[02:23:16.739 --> 02:23:17.659]  It's just great.
[02:23:17.759 --> 02:23:21.261]  It gives you that extra energy and that vitality that you've been missing.
[02:23:21.301 --> 02:23:25.282]  So, Stephan Arneal, my guest, he wrote the book, Hard Times, Strong Men.
[02:23:26.042 --> 02:23:27.383]  You know, you said something the last second.
[02:23:27.703 --> 02:23:30.924]  I'd like you to kind of keep going down that road.
[02:23:30.944 --> 02:23:35.526]  You said you're expecting some hard times coming for 2020 to 2016 to create some strong men.
[02:23:36.186 --> 02:23:38.887]  What do you envision or see coming?
[02:23:40.410 --> 02:23:46.037]  So there's two historical cycles that are converging between 2020 and 2026.
[02:23:46.217 --> 02:23:49.882]  One is the 80-year cycle of war.
[02:23:50.663 --> 02:23:56.209]  And the last time we had hard times create strong men, that was in 1940 in World War II.
[02:23:58.146 --> 02:24:05.332]  And so 20 years, 20 years, 20 years, 20 years, four sets of 20, that's four generations later, is 2020.
[02:24:06.273 --> 02:24:08.054]  And so every eight years we have a big war.
[02:24:08.274 --> 02:24:14.559]  And if you don't believe that, you can look at eight years before World War II was the American Civil War, about 1860.
[02:24:15.980 --> 02:24:19.043]  So, we've got about an 80-year cycle there.
[02:24:19.083 --> 02:24:25.689]  So, 80 years added on to 1940 is 2020, and that could be the next global conflict.
[02:24:25.709 --> 02:24:30.494]  So, that cycle is coming to an end right now, pretty much, in the next year.
[02:24:31.184 --> 02:24:38.486]  And then the other cycle that's converging about the same time is the 250-year lifespan of democracy.
[02:24:39.026 --> 02:24:43.887]  And America started in 1776, and 250 years added onto that is 2026.
[02:24:44.847 --> 02:24:49.268]  So that's usually where we turn into a tyranny.
[02:24:49.288 --> 02:24:53.269]  You know, in Rome, it went from a republic to an empire.
[02:24:53.289 --> 02:24:54.869]  You know, Julius Caesar took over.
[02:24:55.389 --> 02:24:57.450]  So we might end up with an emperor
[02:24:58.311 --> 02:25:00.956]  And not even know it.
[02:25:01.076 --> 02:25:09.251]  So there's two major things happening there, and I hope they don't happen, but that's history and it repeats itself over and over again.
[02:25:09.778 --> 02:25:14.120]  Well, this is actually crazy to kind of go off the deep end into the occult, if you will.
[02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:21.642]  You know, there's the old internet, I guess you could call it a meme or theory, that Donald Trump is a time traveler.
[02:25:21.722 --> 02:25:22.323]  Have you seen this?
[02:25:22.783 --> 02:25:25.384]  Oh yeah, from the Simpsons and stuff?
[02:25:25.544 --> 02:25:28.425]  No, the Ingersoll-Lockwood novels.
[02:25:28.445 --> 02:25:30.666]  Have you seen these Ingersoll-Lockwood novels?
[02:25:31.366 --> 02:25:32.266]  I think I heard about them.
[02:25:32.567 --> 02:25:33.187]  So there's one of them.
[02:25:33.247 --> 02:25:35.308]  Anyway, Ingersoll-Lockwood was writing in the late 1800s.
[02:25:37.093 --> 02:25:37.333]  I don't know.
[02:25:51.181 --> 02:25:53.684]  A fire to Trump Tower in New York.
[02:25:53.724 --> 02:25:56.988]  It literally mentions the address of Trump Hotel in New York.
[02:25:57.708 --> 02:26:01.693]  It talks about the kid that Ingersoll Lockwood originally wrote about, Barron Trump.
[02:26:02.273 --> 02:26:09.401]  Anyway, I'm going off on a jag, but my point is that's wild that you say that because I think that everybody's kind of on that same path.
[02:26:09.482 --> 02:26:11.143]  I was actually talking about this last night too.
[02:26:12.162 --> 02:26:15.507]  Where I think once 2020 hits, it's like a flashpoint.
[02:26:16.008 --> 02:26:23.760]  And I think between 2020 to 2030, the world is going to change so drastically, once 2030 gets here, we're not even going to recognize it.
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:25.823]  I can't even envision 2030, to be honest with you.
[02:26:27.887 --> 02:26:29.269]  Well, there's a lot of things changing.
[02:26:29.309 --> 02:26:31.171]  I mean, technology is going fast.
[02:26:31.571 --> 02:26:32.452]  That's changing.
[02:26:32.552 --> 02:26:34.734]  You've got the society changing.
[02:26:34.754 --> 02:26:38.939]  I mean, I wouldn't have even written a book like Hard Times Create Strong Men five years ago.
[02:26:38.959 --> 02:26:40.100]  I wouldn't even imagine it.
[02:26:40.461 --> 02:26:42.243]  I wouldn't imagine this 10 years ago.
[02:26:42.503 --> 02:26:48.810]  But the rate of change is just happening so fast that we can't even really see what's coming.
[02:26:49.090 --> 02:26:49.811]  I think you're right, Owen.
[02:26:50.984 --> 02:26:54.988]  Now what do you see in the new youth that's kind of coming up right now?
[02:26:55.008 --> 02:27:01.615]  The Gen Z's that seem to not be buying into the liberal indoctrination seem to be going the opposite direction.
[02:27:02.416 --> 02:27:04.438]  What do you see in the development of those males?
[02:27:06.243 --> 02:27:16.072]  Well, I think that there's always a backlash with generations, you know, things go one way and then they go the other way and then they go back and forth like a pendulum.
[02:27:16.553 --> 02:27:21.497]  So, you know, it's kind of like when I was when I was younger, my dad was a downhill skier.
[02:27:21.778 --> 02:27:23.860]  Well, we rejected downhill skiing.
[02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:30.306]  My generation became snowboarders and now the young kids are rejecting snowboarding, going back to skiing.
[02:27:30.926 --> 02:27:41.537]  So, whatever the liberalism being so popular, if that's popular now, the next generation is going to find all the holes in it, and we're going to go back in the other direction.
[02:27:41.637 --> 02:27:48.764]  So, I think it's actually pretty hopeful, and the Gen Z's are pretty smart young people, and I've actually got a lot of them hired in my company.
[02:27:48.784 --> 02:27:50.065]  Alright, final question.
[02:27:50.085 --> 02:27:50.946]  We've got 60 seconds.
[02:27:51.006 --> 02:27:54.390]  If you could give young men listening to the show a bit of advice, what would it be?
[02:27:56.104 --> 02:28:03.091]  Well, I think that they have to define what it means to be a man, and number one is, your purpose is your work.
[02:28:03.231 --> 02:28:08.576]  So, find your purpose, find your work, and read hard times, create strong men.
[02:28:08.716 --> 02:28:12.640]  It'll straighten you out in money, sex, religion, and politics.
[02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:22.807]  Yeah, and they try to make it like this bad thing if you write about being a man, and it's just like, what, men aren't allowed to have, it's like, men aren't allowed to have men's clubs or go to a cigar club.
[02:28:23.247 --> 02:28:24.668]  It's like, but no, that's, they don't want it.
[02:28:24.728 --> 02:28:27.651]  They, you know, they don't want that anymore, and you know why.
[02:28:27.691 --> 02:28:28.771]  You highlight it in your book.
[02:28:28.811 --> 02:28:31.173]  Hardtimesstrongmen.com is the website.
[02:28:31.193 --> 02:28:31.794]  Stephan Arnio.
[02:28:32.074 --> 02:28:33.335]  Hey, thank you so much for joining me today.
[02:28:34.138 --> 02:28:35.318]  I think so, and a great beard.
[02:28:36.199 --> 02:28:37.399]  Why, thank you.
[02:28:37.439 --> 02:28:42.681]  Does this pass the Strong Times Great Hard Men test, this beard?
[02:28:42.741 --> 02:28:44.681]  Yeah, bro, you got better sides than me.
[02:28:44.701 --> 02:28:45.782]  My sides are kind of patchy.
[02:28:45.802 --> 02:28:47.462]  I need some of that to supplement yourself.
[02:28:47.482 --> 02:28:49.383]  Yeah, you gotta get the super male vitality.
[02:28:49.403 --> 02:28:50.783]  Alright, I'll give my secret away.
[02:28:51.223 --> 02:28:52.604]  I just rub it all over my face.
[02:28:53.044 --> 02:28:53.624]  That's what it is.
[02:28:54.384 --> 02:28:55.785]  I actually shaved this morning.
[02:28:56.465 --> 02:29:00.486]  I shaved this morning, I had a bare face, and then I just rubbed super male vitality, and this is what I got.
[02:29:00.626 --> 02:29:01.347]  I don't know how it happened.
[02:29:01.387 --> 02:29:01.747]  It's crazy.
[02:29:02.367 --> 02:29:03.108]  FULLY CONFIDENT!
[02:30:43.704 --> 02:30:51.633]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[02:31:06.468 --> 02:31:07.449]  Marcos, thanks for holding.
[02:31:07.469 --> 02:31:09.590]  I really appreciate you joining us on this Friday edition.
[02:31:09.630 --> 02:31:10.210]  What's your view?
[02:31:10.250 --> 02:31:10.871]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[02:31:10.951 --> 02:31:12.051]  I appreciate you having me on.
[02:31:12.091 --> 02:31:13.872]  First off, I wanted to thank you for the body.
[02:31:13.932 --> 02:31:25.199]  I've been using it for a while, but I sent a bottle to my mom, and after taking it for a few days, she called me literally in tears, saying that she could see the knuckles on her fingers again and, like, the bones in her knees again.
[02:31:25.219 --> 02:31:26.159]  She was ecstatic.
[02:31:26.219 --> 02:31:32.823]  So, personal thank you to you for that, because anybody who makes my mom's life a little bit easier has a special place in my heart.
[02:31:32.983 --> 02:31:33.484]  Tumor-y.
[02:31:34.426 --> 02:31:37.207]  Curry in India is powerful.
[02:31:37.248 --> 02:31:39.509]  The average turmeric product is about 3-5%.
[02:31:39.569 --> 02:31:39.929]  Ours is 95%.
[02:31:39.969 --> 02:31:42.950]  The strongest curcuminoid out there.
[02:31:43.551 --> 02:31:46.152]  So, Advil works great when I got twisted ankle.
[02:31:46.532 --> 02:31:49.934]  This is nature's Advil to the next level.
[02:31:50.514 --> 02:31:52.435]  So that's why Bodies is so incredible.
[02:31:52.475 --> 02:31:54.777]  People should really check it out and support the InfoWars.
[02:31:54.797 --> 02:31:58.238]  So thank you for giving us your testimony about your mother because Bodies is amazing.
[02:31:58.338 --> 02:31:59.119]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[02:32:03.365 --> 02:32:14.394]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[02:32:14.454 --> 02:32:23.060]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[02:32:23.341 --> 02:32:27.364]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[02:32:28.004 --> 02:32:34.373]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[02:32:34.473 --> 02:32:36.556]  And you may be experiencing backup too.
[02:32:36.656 --> 02:32:42.544]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to Infowarsstore.com and get Oxy-Powder.
[02:32:42.584 --> 02:32:45.167]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.
[02:32:45.828 --> 02:32:55.717]  If you're experiencing some cloggage, some backup of your own, Oxy-Powder from InfowarsStore.com will clear it out, guaranteed.
[02:32:56.238 --> 02:33:01.282]  So go to InfowarsStore.com, take care of your clogged plumbing with Oxy-Powder.
[02:33:06.367 --> 02:33:09.009]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.377 --> 02:33:26.100]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:29.382]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:29.642 --> 02:33:32.564]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:32.784 --> 02:33:35.886]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, this is the final segment where I'm gonna be live.
[02:33:36.387 --> 02:33:45.693]  In the next segment, I'm pitching to a breakdown I did of an Ilhan Omar statement on the Hill.
[02:33:46.693 --> 02:33:49.354]  And then Tom Pappert is going to be taking over for the fourth hour.
[02:33:49.854 --> 02:33:54.835]  I've got some news I want to get to here, but first, we've got powerful footage.
[02:33:56.295 --> 02:33:58.715]  This is an incredible video we have right here.
[02:34:00.116 --> 02:34:10.698]  They were airing Theresa May's resignation video live at a popular bar in Britain, and let's see the results.
[02:34:20.803 --> 02:34:22.264]  That pretty much says it all right there.
[02:34:23.085 --> 02:34:30.950]  So May steps down and Britain celebrates its independence from a pathetic weak leader.
[02:34:31.630 --> 02:34:32.010]  All right.
[02:34:34.212 --> 02:34:38.895]  Let's do some news here before Tom Pappert takes over in the fourth hour.
[02:34:39.978 --> 02:34:48.641]  Oh, speaking of Jerry Nadler, who passed out during a press conference today, he says Mueller wants to testify in private.
[02:34:48.821 --> 02:34:50.422]  Oh, imagine my shock.
[02:34:51.402 --> 02:34:54.463]  Oh, you're telling me that they don't want Mueller to testify in public?
[02:34:54.983 --> 02:34:56.043]  Oh, wow, shocking.
[02:34:56.584 --> 02:35:02.766]  You're telling me they're delaying Mueller's testimony because they're trying to get all their ducks in a row for all the crime and treason they committed?
[02:35:03.106 --> 02:35:04.486]  Oh, shocking.
[02:35:07.762 --> 02:35:10.645]  The bad news for them is, it's not going to work.
[02:35:10.705 --> 02:35:16.189]  But, you know, speaking of the Mueller Report, journalist Tim Young pointed this out.
[02:35:16.890 --> 02:35:19.833]  From the Mueller Report, not only did it find no collusion,
[02:35:20.831 --> 02:35:24.373]  They found Putin complaining that it was difficult for Russian government to get in touch with the Trump admin.
[02:35:25.133 --> 02:35:27.354]  A quote from the Mueller report.
[02:35:27.874 --> 02:35:32.517]  Putin spoke of the difficulty faced by the Russian government in getting in touch with the incoming Trump administration.
[02:35:32.977 --> 02:35:41.321]  According to Avon, Putin indicated that he did not know with whom formally to speak and generally did not know the people around the President-elect.
[02:35:41.741 --> 02:35:46.163]  So they want to create a wedge in between the United States and Russia which should be natural allies.
[02:35:48.765 --> 02:35:49.165]  And of course,
[02:35:51.331 --> 02:35:54.232]  It's all ridiculous because they use the whole WikiLeaks angle.
[02:35:55.913 --> 02:35:56.793]  Think about this actually.
[02:35:56.893 --> 02:35:57.513]  Oh my gosh!
[02:35:58.734 --> 02:36:04.275]  So, first they said that WikiLeaks was the connection between Trump and Russia.
[02:36:05.116 --> 02:36:10.057]  Well, Trump is about to have the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange thrown in jail for the rest of his life.
[02:36:10.638 --> 02:36:12.158]  So does that bury that narrative?
[02:36:13.599 --> 02:36:20.601]  But of course, it already should have been buried because why would Trump have to be
[02:36:22.884 --> 02:36:27.189]  Communicating with Wikileaks or working with Wikileaks if he's in direct contact with Putin.
[02:36:27.910 --> 02:36:29.031]  Of course, none of it makes sense.
[02:36:31.794 --> 02:36:34.838]  Trump moves to escalate investigation of intel agencies.
[02:36:34.898 --> 02:36:40.084]  Trump orders intel agencies to assist Barr with review of Russia probe and today he announced he's declassifying all of it.
[02:36:40.104 --> 02:36:41.466]  So they're all going to get exposed.
[02:36:42.082 --> 02:36:43.463]  Now, we've seen this in the past.
[02:36:43.523 --> 02:36:44.764]  This is why Trey Gowdy resigned.
[02:36:45.365 --> 02:36:50.609]  You can point out all the crimes of these people, but if there's no prosecutor willing to prosecute, nothing happens.
[02:36:50.809 --> 02:36:52.550]  And it looks like Joe Biden is going to be involved in this.
[02:36:52.570 --> 02:36:56.973]  Joe Biden reportedly involved in controversial early stages of 2016 rush probe.
[02:36:57.014 --> 02:36:57.634]  Yeah, of course.
[02:36:57.734 --> 02:36:58.915]  He was Obama's vice president.
[02:36:58.935 --> 02:36:59.676]  What do you think this is?
[02:37:01.317 --> 02:37:02.618]  Biden knew everything that was going on.
[02:37:02.658 --> 02:37:04.059]  That's why he's running.
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:06.721]  He's running as a cover-up.
[02:37:07.121 --> 02:37:11.725]  In fact, the entire Biden campaign is a cover-up.
[02:37:12.827 --> 02:37:15.408]  There is no legitimate chance Joe Biden can win.
[02:37:15.748 --> 02:37:16.308]  Let me tell you something.
[02:37:16.748 --> 02:37:25.950]  These polls that they're running, these polls that they're running that say Biden is ahead of anybody are all fake.
[02:37:26.631 --> 02:37:28.891]  And so that tells you that they want Biden.
[02:37:29.391 --> 02:37:33.592]  And so that tells you Biden's in it to cover up for the crimes of Obama.
[02:37:33.873 --> 02:37:35.633]  Or they might do a bait-and-switch at the last minute.
[02:37:35.713 --> 02:37:39.094]  But right now, the establishment is clearly pushing Biden
[02:37:41.826 --> 02:37:44.829]  The egregiousness of even a Fox News.
[02:37:45.130 --> 02:37:49.274]  They put out a poll saying in Pennsylvania Biden is ahead of Trump by five points.
[02:37:49.815 --> 02:37:57.122]  Biden went to Pennsylvania at a crowded park on a beautiful day in Philadelphia and got a couple hundred people to show up to his event.
[02:37:57.443 --> 02:37:59.685]  Most people were just there at the park that day and walked over.
[02:38:00.697 --> 02:38:01.638]  And that was in Philadelphia.
[02:38:01.978 --> 02:38:08.883]  Trump goes to the middle of Pennsylvania, not in a major city, has a rally, 30,000 people.
[02:38:09.563 --> 02:38:10.744]  And then Fox News!
[02:38:10.764 --> 02:38:18.429]  I mean, obviously the fake news, CNN, MSNBC, all of them are gonna... But even Fox News puts out polls saying Biden is ahead of Trump.
[02:38:21.171 --> 02:38:24.273]  I guess some at Fox News are hedging their bets.
[02:38:26.354 --> 02:38:29.797]  You know, most people that go on Fox News just read off a teleprompter.
[02:38:30.933 --> 02:38:32.694]  I don't want to name names because I think they're good people.
[02:38:34.935 --> 02:38:55.887]  And then you have the actual patriots, like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, who are... and then you could throw Lou Dobbs in there, Laura Ingraham at times, who are just committed to exposing the deep state and exposing the left.
[02:38:57.188 --> 02:38:58.789]  Most other people that are in it, it's a job.
[02:38:59.770 --> 02:39:00.990]  They read off the teleprompter.
[02:39:01.410 --> 02:39:03.411]  Some of them are anti-Trump, like a Shep Smith.
[02:39:03.771 --> 02:39:05.551]  Some of them will say what they're told to.
[02:39:06.652 --> 02:39:10.312]  Most of them won't cross any lines they're not supposed to.
[02:39:12.833 --> 02:39:18.114]  So I just wonder, though, is Fox News really hedging their bet in case they don't think Trump wins?
[02:39:18.414 --> 02:39:20.855]  But remember, Fox News didn't support Trump, again.
[02:39:20.875 --> 02:39:26.896]  I mean, look, we're not in a popularity contest here, so we don't care that
[02:39:27.892 --> 02:39:33.036]  You know, if you want to compare us to Fox News, we were responsible for getting Trump in office.
[02:39:33.637 --> 02:39:36.039]  If it was Fox, Trump would have never been president.
[02:39:38.081 --> 02:39:40.022]  Now, who does Trump give the time of day to?
[02:39:40.223 --> 02:39:40.703]  Fox News.
[02:39:42.004 --> 02:39:42.645]  But that's fine.
[02:39:44.286 --> 02:39:45.187]  We know we're the Dark Knight.
[02:39:47.062 --> 02:39:53.963]  But the president is starting to see how Fox is hedging their bets and putting out fake polls to try and destroy him.
[02:39:54.783 --> 02:39:56.784]  All right, let's look at some crazy culture news here.
[02:39:57.324 --> 02:40:01.585]  Teachers slammed for donning sombreros and mustaches in yearbook photo.
[02:40:02.305 --> 02:40:04.585]  So you're just, you're not allowed to have any fun at school anymore.
[02:40:04.805 --> 02:40:08.306]  So the World Language Facility, obviously they teach Spanish.
[02:40:09.126 --> 02:40:14.687]  One of them dressed up like a madame and the rest of them dressed up as seniors or senioritas.
[02:40:17.185 --> 02:40:20.026]  And they put on sombreros and a mustache and had some fun.
[02:40:20.346 --> 02:40:22.867]  You're not allowed to have fun, racist!
[02:40:24.108 --> 02:40:24.968]  Wait, what a joke.
[02:40:24.988 --> 02:40:26.209]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:40:26.709 --> 02:40:28.149]  Ten years ago you'd do something like that.
[02:40:28.650 --> 02:40:29.650]  Nobody blinks an eye.
[02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:31.411]  Now all of a sudden it's racist?
[02:40:32.831 --> 02:40:33.732]  Thanks, left.
[02:40:33.792 --> 02:40:34.452]  Thanks, Obama.
[02:40:35.052 --> 02:40:36.953]  Here's a... This shocked me.
[02:40:38.479 --> 02:40:41.741]  Powder Keg and Dayton, Ohio City braces for KKK rally.
[02:40:41.821 --> 02:40:45.583]  I really couldn't believe this, but there's actually a KKK rally happening in Ohio.
[02:40:45.923 --> 02:40:48.444]  And I'm sitting here thinking to myself, how does this happen?
[02:40:49.945 --> 02:40:53.287]  How can the KKK actually get away with having a rally?
[02:40:53.427 --> 02:40:53.847]  Think about it.
[02:40:55.608 --> 02:41:06.114]  If you plan a rally to support Trump, if you plan a rally to support Trump, leftists are going to show up and violently attack you, okay?
[02:41:07.208 --> 02:41:08.389]  I'm wondering if anybody's going to show up.
[02:41:08.569 --> 02:41:12.111]  Seriously, the KKK should not be able to have a rally.
[02:41:12.131 --> 02:41:12.752]  I mean, this is nuts.
[02:41:13.072 --> 02:41:15.033]  If I lived in Ohio, I would be going to this.
[02:41:15.153 --> 02:41:16.174]  Because here's my theory.
[02:41:17.055 --> 02:41:20.757]  I think that these people claiming to be in the KKK are just agitators.
[02:41:22.038 --> 02:41:25.140]  Who in their right mind goes out in a KKK outfit?
[02:41:27.042 --> 02:41:31.685]  So, you know, I don't condone political violence, but like,
[02:41:33.882 --> 02:41:35.803]  I mean, they're gonna have a KKK march?
[02:41:36.083 --> 02:41:38.004]  I would go out there with a microphone and I'd say, really dude?
[02:41:38.044 --> 02:41:39.124]  You're here with the KKK?
[02:41:40.225 --> 02:41:41.785]  Really dude?
[02:41:42.065 --> 02:41:42.285]  Really?
[02:41:42.305 --> 02:41:44.947]  Or are you just an instigator?
[02:41:45.327 --> 02:41:46.927]  Are you just an agitator?
[02:41:48.688 --> 02:41:49.408]  That's my guess.
[02:41:50.089 --> 02:41:55.471]  Senator Mazie Hirono says she spoke to 8th graders about how abortion rights are under attack.
[02:41:56.198 --> 02:41:59.040]  Oh, really becoming of Maisie Hirono from Hawaii.
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:05.564]  Again, there is no bill of right that you can cite that says you're allowed to have an abortion.
[02:42:07.665 --> 02:42:09.506]  But the right to life, liberty, and happiness?
[02:42:11.487 --> 02:42:13.288]  That is a founding principle.
[02:42:13.769 --> 02:42:14.969]  But the right to an abortion is not.
[02:42:15.530 --> 02:42:16.610]  But not if you ask the Democrats.
[02:42:17.911 --> 02:42:19.072]  Alright, this story was just handed to me.
[02:42:21.308 --> 02:42:26.450]  From Kellen McBreen at Infowars.com, Vietnam War Memorial vandalized on Memorial Day weekend.
[02:42:26.490 --> 02:42:31.312]  Swastikas drawn on monuments, flags thrown into puddles, and bushes ripped from earth.
[02:42:31.332 --> 02:42:35.895]  So, there you go, a bunch of leftists are out desecrating war memorials now.
[02:42:36.195 --> 02:42:37.815]  Which, of course, they've been doing for a while.
[02:42:37.835 --> 02:42:44.278]  You know, the last guest talked about a tough time coming for men.
[02:42:45.819 --> 02:42:47.400]  Folks, I don't want to say it, but...
[02:42:49.514 --> 02:42:54.578]  Let me tell you something, if you're going to be going around desecrating war memorials, someone's going to pop you in the mouth.
[02:42:55.078 --> 02:42:56.619]  So, you better watch out.
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:02.764]  Alright, my breakdown of Ilhan Omar on the other side, and then Tom Pappert.
[02:43:04.305 --> 02:43:18.356]  Remember just four or five years ago, they would have articles in the New York Times, the Washington Post, saying that globalists didn't exist, and that no one wanted global government.
[02:43:20.182 --> 02:43:36.677]  Well, as soon as Hillary lost, they came out and said, okay, global government's real, globalists are real, but they're the good guys, and everyone against globalism is a white supremacist.
[02:43:36.757 --> 02:43:37.138]  Wow!
[02:43:38.439 --> 02:43:40.621]  You know where globalism came from?
[02:43:43.764 --> 02:43:45.005]  It came from the Nazis.
[02:43:47.952 --> 02:43:55.457]  They wanted a system to counter the British Empire that was the global power at that time.
[02:43:55.717 --> 02:43:59.320]  The old saying was, the sun never set on the British Empire.
[02:44:00.621 --> 02:44:02.242]  And Hitler gave speeches.
[02:44:02.682 --> 02:44:03.883]  Hitler wrote articles.
[02:44:03.943 --> 02:44:15.331]  It was all over the news at the time that he wanted a European Union that would then dominate the globe in a form of globalism.
[02:44:16.283 --> 02:44:18.625]  The term globalism actually comes from the Nazis.
[02:44:19.206 --> 02:44:21.428]  The modern Olympics symbols, Dutch.
[02:44:21.508 --> 02:44:24.390]  The VW, the highways, NASA.
[02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:28.234]  I mean, they definitely innovated some stuff in their power grant.
[02:44:30.115 --> 02:44:32.697]  And I'm not saying this is a German or Nazi conspiracy.
[02:44:32.737 --> 02:44:34.059]  Hell, I'm half German myself.
[02:44:34.599 --> 02:44:35.440]  Germans are great people.
[02:44:36.201 --> 02:44:42.146]  But when harnessed by evil, good people can be like horses drawing the devil's carriage.
[02:44:43.533 --> 02:44:53.059]  And so ideas of the Nazis and ideas of the British Empire competed with each other, and big corporations picked up those ideas, and that's modern globalism.
[02:44:54.420 --> 02:45:01.544]  So Infowars is seen as the most pure strain of Americana by the globalists.
[02:45:02.325 --> 02:45:12.051]  I've talked to top people in Hollywood and entertainment and in media and in government, and they've said, Jones, you're seen as Americana.
[02:45:12.790 --> 02:45:23.665]  But they say, as beautiful as Americana is, and I'm not saying I'm beautiful, but Americana's beautiful, it stands in the way of the larger ideas for the planet and a one world government system.
[02:45:25.148 --> 02:45:31.994]  Well, humans are revolting against that one-world government system, and are saying they don't want to be under its hegemonic control.
[02:45:32.715 --> 02:45:37.099]  Their great truth that they're so sure is, for us, isn't for us.
[02:45:37.799 --> 02:45:42.103]  In different countries and parts of the world, we don't want to be under their control.
[02:45:42.143 --> 02:45:44.065]  We don't want to carry out their vision.
[02:45:44.625 --> 02:45:46.787]  We want to live our own lives.
[02:45:46.987 --> 02:45:51.651]  And that's what Infowars represents, and that's why they've set up a system to demonize us.
[02:45:52.773 --> 02:45:54.334]  They've set up a system to lie about us.
[02:45:55.075 --> 02:45:58.557]  They've set up a system to create this strawman of who we are.
[02:45:58.577 --> 02:46:06.323]  Because they understand that people don't do things for money or power at the end of the day.
[02:46:07.183 --> 02:46:08.944]  They do it because of narratives.
[02:46:09.365 --> 02:46:10.526]  They do it because of culture.
[02:46:10.826 --> 02:46:13.868]  They do it because of ethos and what they stand for.
[02:46:16.570 --> 02:46:20.673]  Oh, some people may sell out for money, but people that really count do it for ideology.
[02:46:21.823 --> 02:46:26.268]  And the system knows that I'm trying to reboot, that you're trying to reboot.
[02:46:27.550 --> 02:46:30.353]  A system that competes with the British Empire.
[02:46:30.634 --> 02:46:33.377]  The British Empire called it the American system 200 years ago.
[02:46:33.617 --> 02:46:37.141]  They said our system of empire will fail in competition with this.
[02:46:37.962 --> 02:46:38.904]  Hitler said the same thing.
[02:46:40.060 --> 02:46:42.981]  The truth is, our system was the best and the greatest because it empowered individuals.
[02:46:43.741 --> 02:46:48.002]  And now it's fighting the very same systems of tyranny today.
[02:46:48.642 --> 02:46:50.043]  Join us at Infowars.com.
[02:46:50.423 --> 02:46:51.543]  Join the human community.
[02:46:52.143 --> 02:46:54.284]  And spread the word against the censorship.
[02:46:54.364 --> 02:46:57.005]  And know, we will prevail as we've done in the past.
[02:46:57.445 --> 02:47:01.726]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[02:47:05.867 --> 02:47:08.488]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:22.432 --> 02:47:29.138]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:29.458 --> 02:47:32.781]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:47:45.234 --> 02:47:54.977]  I am frustrated every single time I hear people speaking about their faith and pushing that onto other people.
[02:47:54.997 --> 02:47:55.617]  Pause it!
[02:47:56.918 --> 02:48:00.879]  Is that not what she does with Islam all the time?
[02:48:01.019 --> 02:48:04.360]  I mean, so, so, just again, I want you to just keep this, this is a pattern here.
[02:48:04.881 --> 02:48:06.381]  She's projecting everything.
[02:48:06.841 --> 02:48:09.542]  She's reverse engineering everything and then projecting it.
[02:48:10.342 --> 02:48:11.223]  This is a method.
[02:48:11.303 --> 02:48:12.183]  This is a mechanism.
[02:48:16.607 --> 02:48:21.312]  Alright, I want to play this clip of Ilhan Omar here.
[02:48:25.256 --> 02:48:39.671]  And I realized something about Ilhan Omar hearing this clip that I will explain at the conclusion of it, but here is Ilhan Omar on the House floor yesterday.
[02:48:40.814 --> 02:48:50.818]  Religious fundamentalists are currently trying to manipulate state laws in order to impose their beliefs on an entire society.
[02:48:52.738 --> 02:48:57.620]  All with complete disregard for voices and the rights of American women.
[02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:09.805]  Their recent efforts, like those in Alabama, in Georgia, are only the latest in a long history of efforts to criminalize women.
[02:49:09.825 --> 02:49:10.245]  Pause it real quick.
[02:49:11.853 --> 02:49:13.354]  And rewind it five seconds.
[02:49:14.776 --> 02:49:15.697]  That's not your state.
[02:49:16.878 --> 02:49:19.200]  Let them decide what they want to do in their own state.
[02:49:19.900 --> 02:49:24.464]  But listen to her go on here as she tries to incite civil war in this country.
[02:49:25.085 --> 02:49:34.092]  Are only the latest in a long history of efforts to criminalize women for simply existing.
[02:49:34.373 --> 02:49:35.013]  Pause it right there.
[02:49:35.454 --> 02:49:39.237]  Why don't you go to Iran and take your hijab off?
[02:49:41.288 --> 02:49:44.609]  You want to talk about a country that punishes women for existing?
[02:49:44.829 --> 02:49:50.370]  Why don't you go to Saudi Arabia and walk around without your hijab or your man?
[02:49:51.170 --> 02:49:54.871]  Why don't you go to Somalia without your hijab and walk around on the beach?
[02:49:54.931 --> 02:49:57.071]  How long before you're turned into a sex slave, you think?
[02:49:57.391 --> 02:50:05.293]  And then she's going to come here as a Somalian refugee and talk to us about female oppression.
[02:50:06.533 --> 02:50:08.534]  But I realized something after this speech.
[02:50:08.594 --> 02:50:09.674]  I'll explain, so go on.
[02:50:11.977 --> 02:50:15.519]  When we don't conform to their attempts to control us.
[02:50:16.099 --> 02:50:17.439]  No, that's literally Islamic countries.
[02:50:17.459 --> 02:50:21.521]  But because it's happening here, with the support of the ultra-conservative... I'm sorry, pause right there.
[02:50:21.541 --> 02:50:22.021]  Pause right there.
[02:50:22.061 --> 02:50:22.842]  Rewind it ten seconds.
[02:50:22.862 --> 02:50:24.723]  Because, I'm sorry, I kind of cut that off at a bad time.
[02:50:25.143 --> 02:50:25.723]  Listen, listen.
[02:50:26.163 --> 02:50:27.344]  Listen to what she says here.
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:38.045]  She's actually describing Muslim countries and the oppression of women, and then projecting that onto the West that liberated women, including women such as herself.
[02:50:38.105 --> 02:50:40.426]  But there's a reason why she still wears the hijab.
[02:50:40.626 --> 02:50:42.227]  There's a reason why she projects that.
[02:50:42.247 --> 02:50:43.007]  I'm going to explain at the end.
[02:50:43.087 --> 02:50:43.487]  Alright, go back.
[02:50:45.936 --> 02:50:50.860]  To punish us when we don't conform to their attempts to control us.
[02:50:51.641 --> 02:50:59.267]  But because it's happening here, with the support of the ultra-conservative religious right, we call it religious freedom.
[02:50:59.968 --> 02:51:01.469]  It's simply unthinkable.
[02:51:02.049 --> 02:51:03.210]  Let's just be honest.
[02:51:04.511 --> 02:51:11.757]  For the religious right, this isn't simply about their care or concern for life.
[02:51:13.038 --> 02:51:14.279]  If they cared about
[02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:17.681]  Or we're concerned about children.
[02:51:17.701 --> 02:51:28.864]  They would be concerned about the children that are being detained and those that are dying in camps across our borders.
[02:51:30.464 --> 02:51:36.366]  Or the children who are linguishing in hunger and facing homelessness.
[02:51:37.415 --> 02:51:37.755]  Pause it.
[02:51:38.516 --> 02:51:40.479]  As if that's our responsibility now.
[02:51:40.779 --> 02:51:44.123]  So anyone from any country, if you're hungry, just come on up.
[02:51:44.183 --> 02:51:45.204]  You're our responsibility.
[02:51:45.365 --> 02:51:50.150]  If you need clothes, if you need a home, you got ten kids that need mouths to feed, just come on up.
[02:51:50.391 --> 02:51:51.952]  Somehow that's our responsibility now.
[02:51:52.213 --> 02:51:54.596]  Which, by the way, again, we do the most humanitarian aid in the world.
[02:51:54.656 --> 02:51:55.276]  It's not even close.
[02:51:55.417 --> 02:51:56.438]  We do take a lot of these people.
[02:51:56.578 --> 02:52:06.249]  We can't afford it, it's killing our economy, it's killing our culture, it's making a more third world population, disease is spreading, but that's our responsibility to do that, you see?
[02:52:06.510 --> 02:52:08.772]  That's what we have to do, according to Ilhan.
[02:52:08.852 --> 02:52:09.313]  Alright, go on.
[02:52:10.454 --> 02:52:12.977]  Just morality or conviction.
[02:52:13.945 --> 02:52:30.016]  Because we've seen time and time again those that talk about their faith and want to push policies because of their faith are the ones that simply are caught with the hypocrisy of not living it out in their personal lives.
[02:52:31.197 --> 02:52:40.923]  I am frustrated every single time I hear people speaking about their faith and pushing that onto other people.
[02:52:40.943 --> 02:52:41.504]  Pause it!
[02:52:42.836 --> 02:52:46.798]  Is that not what she does with Islam all the time?
[02:52:46.938 --> 02:52:50.279]  I mean, so, so, just again, I want you to just keep this, this is a pattern here.
[02:52:50.799 --> 02:52:55.461]  She's projecting everything, she's reverse engineering everything, and then projecting it.
[02:52:56.261 --> 02:52:58.162]  This is a method, this is a mechanism.
[02:52:58.182 --> 02:52:59.822]  Alright, finish it.
[02:53:01.023 --> 02:53:03.644]  Those so-called religious politicians
[02:53:05.097 --> 02:53:10.521]  When it comes to their life, their choices, they want to talk about freedom.
[02:53:11.421 --> 02:53:17.486]  But when it comes to other people's lives and other people's choices, they want to talk about religion.
[02:53:19.207 --> 02:53:23.250]  So, here's what you can learn from that, or here's what I learned from that.
[02:53:24.090 --> 02:53:30.735]  There's two things that are conclusively true about that, perhaps either both things or at least one of the two.
[02:53:32.665 --> 02:53:34.747]  Ilhan Omar has an extremely low IQ.
[02:53:35.968 --> 02:53:37.650]  And, I mean, extremely low.
[02:53:38.151 --> 02:53:40.693]  And, you know, part of that's probably not her fault.
[02:53:40.813 --> 02:53:45.618]  She grew up in Somalia, obviously didn't get a good education, learned English at an older age.
[02:53:46.619 --> 02:53:47.220]  So, you know.
[02:53:48.837 --> 02:53:56.461]  We try not to hold that against her so much, but you can tell, but even probably just IQ ability wise, she's very, very low on the scale.
[02:53:56.821 --> 02:54:01.103]  She's in the same IQ category as a Don Lemon, per se.
[02:54:01.443 --> 02:54:02.744]  Very low wattage light bulb.
[02:54:03.584 --> 02:54:15.790]  So that could be true, and this, or perhaps just this, but I'm more convinced of this now than ever after hearing this clip and kind of actually breaking it down.
[02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.911]  Ilhan Omar
[02:54:19.611 --> 02:54:21.152]  I don't know what that means.
[02:54:37.731 --> 02:54:45.815]  I don't know, you'll have people say she's an Israeli operative, you'll have people say she's an operative of Hamas, operative of the Muslim Brotherhood, this, that, or the other thing, radical Islam.
[02:54:46.596 --> 02:54:47.316]  I don't know what it is.
[02:54:47.676 --> 02:54:53.860]  She is clearly trying to incite civil war in this country with her rhetoric every day.
[02:54:55.301 --> 02:55:05.246]  When you twist reality like that, and when you project that out to the public, you are openly engaging in sedition against this country.
[02:55:07.392 --> 02:55:09.994]  And I realize that now, more than ever, that's what's happening here.
[02:55:10.014 --> 02:55:16.739]  Because, I've always asked, why does Ilhan Omar wear the hijab, but not Rashida Tlaib?
[02:55:17.379 --> 02:55:19.161]  Because Ilhan Omar is an operative.
[02:55:19.461 --> 02:55:21.602]  Ilhan Omar is literally there to anger you.
[02:55:21.882 --> 02:55:25.665]  Ilhan Omar is literally there to tell you, you lost to Muslims.
[02:55:26.186 --> 02:55:29.188]  Ilhan Omar is literally here to say, we're coming to your country.
[02:55:29.248 --> 02:55:30.068]  And she tells you it!
[02:55:30.989 --> 02:55:36.073]  But see, she blames you for being hateful and Islamophobic, if you don't like it, when
[02:55:37.503 --> 02:55:44.049]  You know, you've got this story today that's been going for mainstream for the last two days, I think.
[02:55:44.589 --> 02:55:48.353]  American Taliban Lend Released As Afghan War Still Boils.
[02:55:48.413 --> 02:55:51.015]  So, you know, any of the stories you read about this, it's the same thing.
[02:55:52.557 --> 02:55:55.659]  You know, this guy converted to a radical Muslim.
[02:55:56.770 --> 02:56:01.913]  And this is all happening during the Afghan wars, which was a result of what?
[02:56:02.534 --> 02:56:05.496]  September 11, 2001, which was blamed on what?
[02:56:05.956 --> 02:56:10.439]  Radical Islamic terrorists that hate the West, hate our way of life, and want us all to die.
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:15.482]  That narrative has never been changed.
[02:56:16.243 --> 02:56:18.544]  The 9-11 Commission has never been changed.
[02:56:18.945 --> 02:56:22.427]  We're still told we're at war with radical Islamic terror.
[02:56:22.787 --> 02:56:24.829]  Yet, if you say that, though,
[02:56:25.765 --> 02:56:27.506]  You're now considered Islamophobic.
[02:56:27.526 --> 02:56:28.286]  So do you see?
[02:56:28.966 --> 02:56:35.668]  How can you actually have those co-existing truths and consider yourself a logical human being?
[02:56:35.708 --> 02:56:36.209]  You can't.
[02:56:36.609 --> 02:56:37.269]  It's ridiculous.
[02:56:37.589 --> 02:56:41.190]  But the problem is most people have zero logic or reasoning anymore, so they don't even think that much.
[02:56:41.230 --> 02:56:44.972]  But you read all the stories about the American Taliban Lin guy.
[02:56:44.992 --> 02:56:47.452]  He just got released early.
[02:56:47.513 --> 02:56:48.573]  He'll be under strict watch.
[02:56:49.929 --> 02:56:52.111]  And it's all about radical Islamic terror on September 11, 2001.
[02:56:53.232 --> 02:57:00.337]  But if you say that outside of the context of September 11, 2001, somehow you're Islamophobic, somehow you're bigoted against Islam.
[02:57:01.618 --> 02:57:05.841]  These are the logical incongruencies that drive me crazy.
[02:57:06.302 --> 02:57:07.623]  A couple more stories here on that.
[02:57:07.823 --> 02:57:10.245]  Iraq's Christians close to extinction.
[02:57:11.065 --> 02:57:16.510]  And, you know, you can blame this on whatever you want, but the numbers actually decreased after the U.S.
[02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:17.010]  intervention.
[02:57:18.539 --> 02:57:21.620]  Iran's youth will witness the demise of America and Israel.
[02:57:21.780 --> 02:57:25.681]  Ayatollah Khamenei vows as commander, boasts Trump wouldn't dare attack.
[02:57:25.761 --> 02:57:31.583]  Boy, he wouldn't say that unless he knew he had Russia and China having his back, but I don't know.
[02:57:31.603 --> 02:57:37.965]  They've always kind of been extremely harsh with their rhetoric, so that's just him probably trying to be a tough guy against Trump.
[02:57:38.586 --> 02:57:42.527]  But make no mistake, I mean, they don't like Israel and they don't like America.
[02:57:57.240 --> 02:57:59.182]  The dodo is an extinct bird.
[02:57:59.482 --> 02:58:02.385]  Big, fat, juicy, delicious birds the size of a turkey.
[02:58:02.525 --> 02:58:03.646]  They never had a predator.
[02:58:03.666 --> 02:58:06.348]  There weren't any wolves, there weren't any foxes, there weren't any dogs.
[02:58:06.428 --> 02:58:08.410]  There's nothing but these birds running around on this island.
[02:58:08.590 --> 02:58:12.973]  And within just a few years of sailors finding the island, whaling ships would go stop there.
[02:58:13.974 --> 02:58:17.596]  They just walk up with an oar and just club them in the head and eat them.
[02:58:17.616 --> 02:58:18.577]  Big ol' fat juicy meal.
[02:58:18.757 --> 02:58:21.358]  So the dodo... People call people a dodo.
[02:58:21.398 --> 02:58:24.240]  They're stupid and don't care about themselves and fall off the edge of a cliff.
[02:58:24.260 --> 02:58:24.720]  They're stupid.
[02:58:24.780 --> 02:58:26.741]  But it was they'd never seen humans.
[02:58:26.801 --> 02:58:27.982]  They'd never had a predator.
[02:58:28.002 --> 02:58:29.343]  They had no fear.
[02:58:29.423 --> 02:58:30.223]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:58:30.523 --> 02:58:33.165]  If I was a chicken, I'm running around like my head's cut off.
[02:58:33.325 --> 02:58:34.425]  And you know why I feel like that?
[02:58:34.465 --> 02:58:35.065]  Why I'm pissed?
[02:58:35.285 --> 02:58:37.406]  Because my instincts are lined up in normal.
[02:58:37.466 --> 02:58:38.606]  We have world government.
[02:58:38.646 --> 02:58:40.866]  We have Democrats saying they're killing babies after they're born.
[02:58:40.966 --> 02:58:42.927]  We have sex education to five-year-olds.
[02:58:43.027 --> 02:58:45.947]  We have total evil Hollywood demoralizing us.
[02:58:45.987 --> 02:58:47.167]  They attack on the family.
[02:58:47.247 --> 02:58:47.988]  All these lies.
[02:58:48.128 --> 02:58:52.668]  We have criminal collapse news networks calling anyone that doesn't submit to them Nazis.
[02:58:52.808 --> 02:58:56.669]  And then using their fake claim that you're a Nazi to have your bank accounts taken.
[02:58:56.729 --> 02:58:57.689]  That's what the Nazis did.
[02:58:57.849 --> 02:59:01.210]  And as a man, I become physically angry at this point.
[02:59:01.630 --> 02:59:03.793]  You don't fundamentally get pissed at that.
[02:59:03.893 --> 02:59:04.934]  You're a dodo bird.
[02:59:05.094 --> 02:59:06.315]  Folks, I'm not a dodo bird.
[02:59:06.436 --> 02:59:07.977]  And I'm not going to compare myself to an eagle.
[02:59:08.097 --> 02:59:10.200]  Let me just compare myself to a chicken.
[02:59:10.580 --> 02:59:13.684]  Chicken sees a hawk fly over, that chicken runs for the bushes.
[02:59:14.605 --> 02:59:17.528]  That chicken goes... To tell others, hey...
[02:59:18.169 --> 02:59:19.950]  The hawk that eats us, he just flew over.
[02:59:20.171 --> 02:59:27.596]  You see, the Dodos were on that island for probably millions of years and nothing ever ate them, at least hundreds of thousands, so they didn't have a race memory.
[02:59:27.656 --> 02:59:35.562]  But you can take a chicken or any other creature that's ever been around predators and they know about predators, they know what they look like, even though they never
[02:59:41.237 --> 02:59:41.857]  They have instincts.
[02:59:42.437 --> 02:59:43.198]  They have soul.
[02:59:43.718 --> 02:59:44.458]  They have spirit.
[02:59:44.878 --> 02:59:46.579]  Those are transference of the genetic memory.
[02:59:47.419 --> 02:59:50.580]  Those who aren't upset, you do not have soul.
[02:59:55.382 --> 03:00:01.304]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.895 --> 03:00:11.379]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:00:11.919 --> 03:00:13.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.862 --> 03:00:18.724]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:18.804 --> 03:00:20.786]  I am Tom Papert filling in for Alex today.
[03:00:20.806 --> 03:00:24.268]  He'll be back on Sunday with the afternoon broadcast there.
[03:00:24.749 --> 03:00:32.635]  Today is kind of a massive day not just here in the United States where you have massive leftists passing out and that is not an unintentional pun.
[03:00:32.995 --> 03:00:34.176]  You have leftists passing out.
[03:00:34.196 --> 03:00:38.339]  You have Nancy Pelosi doddering across the pond in the United Kingdom.
[03:00:38.379 --> 03:00:41.641]  Theresa May, Prime Minister, is stepping down.
[03:00:41.982 --> 03:00:53.470]  The public is overjoyed, shouting, crying tears of joy as this woman who has essentially blocked Brexit, covered up pedophile scandals, she is finally, finally, finally getting out of power there.
[03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:56.873]  But also in Europe, there's been a massive attack
[03:00:57.473 --> 03:01:20.266]  We do not yet know the circumstances, the perpetrators, the reason behind it, but I like to point to Coulter's Law in this type of situation, where the longer we go without finding the name, identity, religion of the perpetrator, the more likely it is to be radical Islam attacking poor, innocent people yet again.
[03:01:20.746 --> 03:01:24.547]  So we're going to get into that more in the next segment, but there is a lot to talk about today.
[03:01:24.587 --> 03:01:28.048]  There is more going on with the Facebook and tech censorship angle.
[03:01:28.328 --> 03:01:43.051]  CrossFit now, believe it or not, CrossFit, of all people, are now boycotting Facebook and Instagram after one of their massive groups, it was an affiliate group with 1.65 million users in it, was banned without reason.
[03:01:43.857 --> 03:01:50.139]  It's absolutely baffling to see our big tech overlords begin to extend this beyond just conservatives.
[03:01:50.500 --> 03:02:04.265]  They've realized doing it to Alex Jones, doing it to Infowars, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, Milo Yiannopoulos, Gavin McKenna, so many other names, I could go into my own little Jerry Nadler dehydration fit if I were to name them all.
[03:02:04.745 --> 03:02:09.027]  But it's fascinating to me that they are using this as their opportunity.
[03:02:09.307 --> 03:02:11.909]  They saw nobody came to the rescue with InfoWars.
[03:02:12.189 --> 03:02:13.370]  President Trump is tweeting.
[03:02:13.630 --> 03:02:14.970]  The President's son is tweeting.
[03:02:15.211 --> 03:02:19.613]  People are trying, but nobody in Congress is doing anything meaningful.
[03:02:19.973 --> 03:02:22.695]  Nobody is going to hold these powers accountable.
[03:02:22.755 --> 03:02:23.195]  So now...
[03:02:24.055 --> 03:02:33.403]  If you run a health and fitness program that goes contrary to the establishment agenda for what that should look like, you too can be taken down.
[03:02:33.984 --> 03:02:48.176]  And we've seen this on Twitter now as well, where the Krasenstein brothers, the two never-Trump resistance twins who are always in the president's subtweets, anytime he tweets they issue a response, well now they've been banned.
[03:02:48.786 --> 03:02:52.629]  For, allegedly, having fake engagement.
[03:02:52.689 --> 03:02:54.971]  They pay people to boost their Twitter profile.
[03:02:54.991 --> 03:02:57.393]  Which is wrong, and it's against Twitter's rules.
[03:02:58.273 --> 03:03:03.337]  But I think what it is, is somebody at Twitter HQ decided that they make the left look bad.
[03:03:03.697 --> 03:03:12.784]  Because they're hysterical, they're never Trump, they don't want to push any type of actual meaningful change, they just want to say, orange man bad.
[03:03:13.365 --> 03:03:14.726]  And so I think what we're gonna see here,
[03:03:15.530 --> 03:03:24.119]  As we go into the 2020 election and then beyond, we're going to see social media and big tech flexing its muscles like never before.
[03:03:24.559 --> 03:03:29.204]  If you say anything contrary to what they believe in, they are coming after you.
[03:03:29.784 --> 03:03:33.148]  And of course, they're nothing but the globalist propaganda outlet.
[03:03:33.448 --> 03:03:39.154]  They're nothing but the ideological masters who served the left and are served by the left.
[03:03:39.734 --> 03:03:41.696]  So we know exactly what that's going to look like.
[03:03:41.836 --> 03:03:45.159]  Anybody who is even somewhat of a nationalist is going to be hurt.
[03:03:45.799 --> 03:03:55.228]  I believe Bernie Sanders of all people is being shadow banned because he goes against the wishes of his Democrat paymasters, the real people in charge.
[03:03:56.128 --> 03:03:58.309]  So, all this and more is coming up in the next segment.
[03:03:58.349 --> 03:03:59.529]  Again, I am Tom Pappert.
[03:03:59.569 --> 03:04:01.869]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:01.909 --> 03:04:10.551]  Before we take off for a brief break, I do want to remind everybody, this channel, InfoWars, this platform depends directly on your support.
[03:04:10.591 --> 03:04:13.252]  There are some amazing Memorial Day sales going on right now.
[03:04:13.652 --> 03:04:16.252]  InfoWarsStore.com is the website.
[03:04:16.552 --> 03:04:24.314]  If you get value out of this programming, you owe it to the team, the wonderful people making this show happen right now who are behind the scenes working.
[03:04:24.694 --> 03:04:28.596]  You owe it to everyone involved to show your support financially, if at all possible.
[03:04:28.736 --> 03:04:36.521]  Share the links, go to the store, go out on the street corner and yell at the top of your lungs, his name is Alex Jones.
[03:04:36.961 --> 03:04:37.922]  We're going to be right back.
[03:04:38.182 --> 03:04:39.022]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[03:04:39.122 --> 03:04:40.923]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:40.943 --> 03:04:44.065]  We're going to break down what's happening in France on the other side of the break.
[03:04:44.425 --> 03:04:46.987]  Coming up here in just a couple minutes.
[03:04:47.047 --> 03:04:50.369]  Thank you all so much for watching and thank you all for supporting this broadcast.
[03:04:50.870 --> 03:04:55.390]  We will be back momentarily here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:02.944 --> 03:06:13.590]  I think it's official.
[03:06:13.710 --> 03:06:18.633]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:21.624 --> 03:06:25.327]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:25.467 --> 03:06:28.249]  I'm Tom Papert, Facebook's God Emperor Trump.
[03:06:28.750 --> 03:06:32.432]  Let's talk about what's happening across the pond today.
[03:06:32.472 --> 03:06:33.633]  There's been another attack.
[03:06:34.354 --> 03:06:41.099]  We do not yet know if it's a terrorist attack, but does it not seem likely based on what's been going on in that poor, poor nation of France?
[03:06:41.699 --> 03:06:48.124]  Donald Trump said in July of 2016, France is no longer France.
[03:06:48.825 --> 03:06:51.067]  And he took a lot of flack for it, but at the time,
[03:06:52.259 --> 03:06:54.343]  A priest was just stabbed!
[03:06:55.224 --> 03:06:57.729]  And it was just shortly after a truck attack.
[03:06:57.749 --> 03:06:59.191]  You remember that's how it was described.
[03:06:59.251 --> 03:07:00.113]  A truck attack!
[03:07:01.260 --> 03:07:02.301]  And it was horrifying.
[03:07:02.741 --> 03:07:06.182]  And then the media seemed to get tired of talking about terrorism.
[03:07:06.463 --> 03:07:13.686]  In fact, we had a top-down order from the Joe Biden, I believe it was, who said the media should stop talking about terrorism.
[03:07:13.726 --> 03:07:16.808]  The media should stop reporting on all terrorist activities.
[03:07:17.128 --> 03:07:18.188]  It just encourages them.
[03:07:18.228 --> 03:07:21.470]  So as a result, we the people have not really known what's been happening.
[03:07:21.490 --> 03:07:24.792]  But today, there has been another attack, as I said a moment ago.
[03:07:24.892 --> 03:07:27.533]  Several injured in parcel bomb attack.
[03:07:27.973 --> 03:07:31.114]  In France, we've got an article up at BigLeaguePolitics.com.
[03:07:31.474 --> 03:07:38.996]  At least eight people were injured today in a parcel bomb attack in Lyon, France, according to multiple sources.
[03:07:39.136 --> 03:07:47.338]  According to NBC, the explosion happened near Rue Victor Hugo and Sala Street in the third largest city in France, about 300 miles southeast of Paris.
[03:07:47.798 --> 03:07:49.898]  And that is according to the national police.
[03:07:50.639 --> 03:07:51.479]  French President
[03:07:52.459 --> 03:07:59.322]  And universally loathed person Emmanuel Macron described the incident as an attack and has provided no further details.
[03:08:00.043 --> 03:08:03.344]  And again, this is France's third largest city.
[03:08:04.042 --> 03:08:06.624]  The timing is also suspicious, is it not?
[03:08:06.924 --> 03:08:14.969]  We are in the month of Ramadan, the holy month for Islam, which just for some strange reason seems to result in all kinds of terrorist activity.
[03:08:15.029 --> 03:08:17.851]  People being bombed, people being stabbed, people being shot.
[03:08:18.312 --> 03:08:23.315]  And of course, it is worth repeating, we do not yet know the motives behind this attack.
[03:08:23.615 --> 03:08:27.638]  And it will be fascinating to see what comes out of this, exactly what comes
[03:08:28.198 --> 03:08:30.162]  Of this to learn, whether or not it is Muslim.
[03:08:30.182 --> 03:08:33.727]  But as I said in the last segment, if you happen to be watching, I believe in culture's law.
[03:08:33.767 --> 03:08:40.538]  The longer we go without hearing who the perpetrator is, what their motivation was, what their religion might have been, what their name was...
[03:08:41.550 --> 03:08:43.892]  The more likely it is to be Islamic terror.
[03:08:44.512 --> 03:08:46.313]  One witness was a block away.
[03:08:46.574 --> 03:08:48.995]  He said, I was a block away when I heard it.
[03:08:49.756 --> 03:08:50.897]  They locked us in the store.
[03:08:50.957 --> 03:08:53.999]  I came out ten minutes later and the police, etc., were arriving.
[03:08:54.039 --> 03:08:57.502]  She described the witness, the explosion as like a bomb.
[03:08:57.842 --> 03:08:59.023]  Extremely loud.
[03:08:59.523 --> 03:09:00.824]  We know that it's a nail bomb.
[03:09:01.825 --> 03:09:03.326]  We know that ISIS
[03:09:04.031 --> 03:09:06.212]  Completely out of its territory.
[03:09:06.292 --> 03:09:11.054]  It's been totally recaptured by President Trump and turned over to slightly less insane people, I would hope.
[03:09:11.654 --> 03:09:17.077]  We know that ISIS is telling its adherents across the globe that now is the time to attack.
[03:09:17.137 --> 03:09:23.140]  They've previously said, run over the people with your vehicle, build a homemade bomb, splash them with acid.
[03:09:23.260 --> 03:09:27.202]  All of this that is happening as we speak across Europe.
[03:09:27.922 --> 03:09:28.022]  And
[03:09:29.005 --> 03:09:38.851]  It is almost sad to think of the poor French people, where they tried, they tried to elect someone, they tried to elect their own version of President Trump, and instead they got the globalist.
[03:09:39.551 --> 03:09:49.217]  Instead they got Macron, who went before global leaders and said, while America is suffering through President Trump, I will take the place of the United States of America.
[03:09:49.577 --> 03:09:50.317]  Macron!
[03:09:50.698 --> 03:09:51.258]  France!
[03:09:51.618 --> 03:09:56.401]  We will be the new world leader when it comes to fighting right-wing extremism.
[03:09:57.392 --> 03:09:58.713]  France will lead the way.
[03:09:58.753 --> 03:10:03.736]  Well, France has been rocked, rocked, rocked, rocked by Yellow Vest protests.
[03:10:04.417 --> 03:10:06.278]  Macron is universally hated among his people.
[03:10:06.298 --> 03:10:09.260]  He has some of the lowest approval ratings in the nation's history.
[03:10:09.622 --> 03:10:10.803]  The country is falling apart.
[03:10:10.843 --> 03:10:12.044]  There's attack after attack.
[03:10:12.084 --> 03:10:17.729]  Of course, the great cathedral, Notre Dame, just had a strange fire.
[03:10:18.070 --> 03:10:19.211]  Electrical issue, apparently.
[03:10:19.451 --> 03:10:20.752]  Electrical issue, would you believe that?
[03:10:21.232 --> 03:10:24.195]  Electrical fire last month, or maybe it was the month before.
[03:10:24.455 --> 03:10:26.597]  And again, President Trump predicted all of this.
[03:10:26.637 --> 03:10:31.942]  I want to turn back to this Politico article from 2016 because he was absolutely right!
[03:10:33.232 --> 03:10:36.315]  And he said something that I think is very important.
[03:10:36.675 --> 03:10:38.336]  He said, you see what happened to the French priest?
[03:10:38.376 --> 03:10:40.998]  A friend of mine, he said he was going to France three or four months ago.
[03:10:41.058 --> 03:10:41.899]  I saw him yesterday.
[03:10:41.919 --> 03:10:43.000]  I said, how did he like France?
[03:10:43.340 --> 03:10:45.342]  He said, I wouldn't go to France because France.
[03:10:46.207 --> 03:10:47.128]  Is no longer France.
[03:10:47.849 --> 03:10:52.473]  President Trump also said, then candidate Trump, they won't like me for saying that, but you see what happened in Nice.
[03:10:52.513 --> 03:10:55.696]  You see what happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man.
[03:10:55.776 --> 03:11:06.385]  France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and they'll never do it with Hillary Clinton.
[03:11:07.844 --> 03:11:11.068]  We haven't really had much terrorism in the United States, have we?
[03:11:11.129 --> 03:11:23.646]  Now, there are certainly lots of questions that may never be answered about what happened in the Las Vegas shooting and other shootings, but we haven't had a large-scale terrorist attack since President Trump got into office, and that's not for lack of trying.
[03:11:24.264 --> 03:11:27.707]  But I think these people are realizing that it's going to be a whole lot harder nowadays.
[03:11:27.767 --> 03:11:31.890]  Now, as I say that, we have terrorists trying to get through our poorest southern border.
[03:11:32.190 --> 03:11:33.971]  We have ISIS saber-rattling.
[03:11:34.211 --> 03:11:39.995]  We have John Bolton in the White House urging President Trump to go to war just about everywhere in the globe.
[03:11:40.136 --> 03:11:42.437]  Syria, Iran, Venezuela.
[03:11:42.797 --> 03:11:45.479]  If it even looks like he's got an opening, he wants war.
[03:11:46.160 --> 03:11:46.820]  He wants war.
[03:11:46.920 --> 03:11:48.842]  But still, the United States
[03:11:49.657 --> 03:11:51.939]  Sharp decline in terrorist attacks, it would seem.
[03:11:52.520 --> 03:11:55.943]  And I wonder, would we have enjoyed that under Hillary Clinton?
[03:11:55.983 --> 03:12:02.549]  But this latest attack in France comes only days after a Parisian airport was stormed by migrants.
[03:12:03.490 --> 03:12:03.910]  Migrants.
[03:12:03.950 --> 03:12:06.753]  The migrants of peace, in protest of deportation.
[03:12:07.854 --> 03:12:11.878]  And is this not the most ironic thing you've ever heard in your life?
[03:12:12.358 --> 03:12:14.320]  France, with the globalist Macron.
[03:12:15.390 --> 03:12:17.071]  Well, the migrants are mad at him, too.
[03:12:17.111 --> 03:12:20.512]  It just goes to show there is no way you can make these people happy.
[03:12:20.572 --> 03:12:29.096]  You cannot be a fence-sitter and attempt to make all the leftists and the populists and the migrants and all of these different elements.
[03:12:29.116 --> 03:12:30.677]  You just can't make them all happy.
[03:12:31.117 --> 03:12:32.998]  And so it pays to be like President Trump.
[03:12:33.058 --> 03:12:34.638]  It pays to take a hard-line stance.
[03:12:35.359 --> 03:12:37.980]  This is what someone, one of the migrants, yelled.
[03:12:38.040 --> 03:12:40.501]  France does not belong to the French.
[03:12:40.781 --> 03:12:42.662]  Everyone has a right to be here.
[03:12:43.356 --> 03:12:45.318]  Well, President Trump said it in 2016.
[03:12:45.998 --> 03:12:47.099]  France is no longer France.
[03:12:47.119 --> 03:12:49.481]  Well, France is no longer French, according to this migrant.
[03:12:49.921 --> 03:12:57.727]  The protest was organized by an open borders group called Collectif de Chapelle-de-Boue, which streamed the event live on its Facebook.
[03:12:58.027 --> 03:12:58.948]  They're allowed to Facebook.
[03:12:59.669 --> 03:13:05.053]  The protesters referred to Air France as the official deporter of the French state and demanded to speak with Edouard Philippe,
[03:13:05.333 --> 03:13:18.568]  French President Emmanuel Macron's Prime Minister quotes several hundred undocumented migrants invade Terminal 2 at Royce Airport to denounce evictions and the treatment of undocumented migrants, use of tear gas by police officers.
[03:13:18.868 --> 03:13:24.655]  They want to talk to the CEO of Air France and the Prime Minister, said French journalist Rami Bassin.
[03:13:26.713 --> 03:13:28.114]  I just think it's so precious.
[03:13:28.594 --> 03:13:30.675]  These global estates are crumbling.
[03:13:30.955 --> 03:13:32.656]  And it's their own destruction.
[03:13:32.716 --> 03:13:33.716]  It's their own undoing.
[03:13:34.257 --> 03:13:38.839]  Remember, we have to bring the migrants in because populations are declining and we need a new tax base.
[03:13:38.859 --> 03:13:41.560]  So you bring these people in, you get totally overrun.
[03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:43.521]  You realize that they have no skills.
[03:13:43.581 --> 03:13:44.902]  They bring nothing to the table.
[03:13:44.942 --> 03:13:46.943]  They want your handouts and nothing else.
[03:13:47.543 --> 03:13:54.026]  And then, when you don't give them the handouts, tell them you might just have to go back home, they get violent.
[03:13:54.527 --> 03:13:55.307]  They get angry.
[03:13:55.814 --> 03:13:57.155]  They storm an airport.
[03:13:57.955 --> 03:14:01.497]  And what is the humor in that they are allowed to stream that?
[03:14:01.597 --> 03:14:03.218]  That is something special in and of itself.
[03:14:03.658 --> 03:14:06.139]  Now, this does hearken back.
[03:14:06.200 --> 03:14:11.863]  The American media, the globalist media in general, Fox News, I heard Owen talking about Fox News just before I came on.
[03:14:12.263 --> 03:14:14.604]  They're not doing any favors to France or Europe.
[03:14:15.433 --> 03:14:25.059]  When the Notre Dame Cathedral was still burning, they ended interviews prematurely with two different Fox guests who brought up the pattern of church fires in France.
[03:14:25.519 --> 03:14:31.382]  France had, in the month of March, I think 10 or 15 churches, Catholic churches, attacked in various ways.
[03:14:31.462 --> 03:14:39.567]  In some instances, they smeared excrement onto crosses and put communion wafers on them.
[03:14:40.723 --> 03:14:41.863]  Stunning and brave.
[03:14:41.963 --> 03:14:43.284]  Absolutely stunning and brave.
[03:14:43.504 --> 03:14:46.704]  And you notice the American media has not been really covering this.
[03:14:47.224 --> 03:14:53.586]  And especially if the name comes out and it turns out to be one of these poor, peaceful migrants, I think that we will never hear anything from it.
[03:14:53.646 --> 03:14:57.587]  And the likes of Shep Smith, who is an alleged sexual predator.
[03:14:57.627 --> 03:15:03.588]  He allegedly got a man drunk, took him to his apartment, and attempted to kiss him and maybe grope him.
[03:15:04.268 --> 03:15:05.588]  Disgusting people, if true.
[03:15:06.608 --> 03:15:07.449]  He has no interest.
[03:15:07.809 --> 03:15:08.249]  No interest.
[03:15:08.269 --> 03:15:09.029]  He's going to parrot
[03:15:09.687 --> 03:15:11.970]  He's gonna parrot whatever the left wing says.
[03:15:12.250 --> 03:15:15.554]  There was also a jihadi who planned a bombing of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.
[03:15:15.594 --> 03:15:16.895]  He got eight years in prison.
[03:15:16.935 --> 03:15:18.397]  Thankfully, that wasn't successful.
[03:15:18.697 --> 03:15:21.761]  And a freak electrical incident did his job for him anyway.
[03:15:22.341 --> 03:15:23.503]  It is absolutely fascinating.
[03:15:23.523 --> 03:15:27.988]  And of course, as I mentioned, France has been absolutely shook.
[03:15:28.854 --> 03:15:39.500]  By the Yellow Vest protests, who are tired of socialism, tired of migrants getting a free pass, and it really is from all walks of life, people coming forward to say that this globalist system does not work for the people.
[03:15:40.201 --> 03:15:43.223]  So, as we learn more about this attack, we'll be sure to update you.
[03:15:43.503 --> 03:15:45.424]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:45.604 --> 03:15:51.888]  I'm Tom Papert, Facebook's God Emperor Trump, filling in for the fourth hour, and thank you to Alex, and thank you to the crew for making that possible.
[03:15:52.228 --> 03:15:55.010]  We're going to be right back after this next commercial break.
[03:15:55.311 --> 03:15:57.412]  Again, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:57.713 --> 03:15:59.034]  I am Tom Pappert.
[03:15:59.054 --> 03:16:02.516]  We'll see you in a minute.
[03:16:08.621 --> 03:16:10.082]  I didn't go to college for marketing.
[03:16:10.963 --> 03:16:13.265]  I don't sit around and have traditional marketing meetings.
[03:16:13.745 --> 03:16:16.548]  I go with my gut and how I want to be treated.
[03:16:17.809 --> 03:16:18.870]  So I do market research.
[03:16:19.050 --> 03:16:20.171]  What's already the highest rated?
[03:16:20.856 --> 03:16:22.837]  What already is the best-selling?
[03:16:23.437 --> 03:16:27.378]  And then we go look at it, we make it better, and sell it for a lower price.
[03:16:28.079 --> 03:16:29.799]  Viewers and listeners understand my philosophy.
[03:16:30.200 --> 03:16:30.960]  And you've responded.
[03:16:31.060 --> 03:16:37.722]  We have a very large, successful supplement company because the quality is amazing, and because of your support.
[03:16:39.383 --> 03:16:46.866]  But looking into this a few years ago, I was like, you know, I forget to take supplements myself, and our listeners forget.
[03:16:47.486 --> 03:16:49.927]  How do I get myself and others to remember to take it?
[03:16:50.902 --> 03:16:55.412]  And my crew, who was just getting into marketing, goes, it's funny you say that, boss.
[03:16:56.735 --> 03:16:59.962]  Everything for 20 years, and now more than ever, is PAX.
[03:17:01.357 --> 03:17:03.538]  One pack a day, two packs a day, three packs a day.
[03:17:03.858 --> 03:17:04.738]  So it's all there.
[03:17:05.018 --> 03:17:05.618]  You don't forget.
[03:17:05.638 --> 03:17:06.518]  It's on a bunch of bottles.
[03:17:06.879 --> 03:17:07.779]  You put it in your pocket.
[03:17:07.799 --> 03:17:08.539]  You put it in your purse.
[03:17:08.559 --> 03:17:09.259]  You put it in your wallet.
[03:17:09.459 --> 03:17:10.600]  You put it in your car, your truck.
[03:17:10.680 --> 03:17:11.100]  It's ready.
[03:17:11.720 --> 03:17:13.720]  That's the 8-pack Power Stack.
[03:17:14.541 --> 03:17:19.082]  And out of the gates, we're offering it at 50% off.
[03:17:19.242 --> 03:17:22.923]  Very close to what it costs us to make.
[03:17:22.983 --> 03:17:24.583]  There is a lot of money in this.
[03:17:25.044 --> 03:17:26.344]  These are all the very best.
[03:17:27.484 --> 03:17:29.645]  And 13 pills, 8 new formulas.
[03:17:30.629 --> 03:17:31.470]  It's amazing.
[03:17:32.612 --> 03:17:35.877]  InfoWorksStore.com, InfoWorksLife.com.
[03:17:36.358 --> 03:17:42.467]  50% off because I want you to get it, I want you to see how great it is, and then I want you to sign up for auto shipping if you need to get it.
[03:17:43.869 --> 03:17:44.310]  50% off!
[03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:56.258]  The AM Wake Up and Work Pack includes a Flex and Joint Support Formula, an Energy Kickstart Formula, a Krill Oil Formula, a Nootropic Brain Formula, and a Greens Detox Formula.
[03:17:56.699 --> 03:17:58.000]  All those work together synergistically.
[03:17:58.420 --> 03:18:08.848]  The PM Rest and Recover Pack includes Immune Support Formula, Sound Sleep Formula, Krill Oil Formula, that's good day and night, and Bone Support Formula.
[03:18:09.568 --> 03:18:10.189]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:18:11.724 --> 03:18:15.010]  Comparable packs that aren't even as good are retail $125.
[03:18:15.050 --> 03:18:15.411]  This is retail.
[03:18:19.133 --> 03:18:20.153]  Up there like a hundred bucks.
[03:18:21.333 --> 03:18:25.294]  It is, right now ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[03:18:25.854 --> 03:18:31.356]  A major gamble for us because I believe you're going to reorder it close to the regular price and support the info we're after.
[03:18:31.936 --> 03:18:34.976]  This is total health and performance.
[03:18:35.777 --> 03:18:37.137]  I treat my body like hell.
[03:18:37.237 --> 03:18:39.077]  I work 18 hours a day many days.
[03:18:39.197 --> 03:18:40.418]  I take on the weight of the world.
[03:18:40.558 --> 03:18:45.819]  I focus on the injustice and I face the enemy and I fight them at every level.
[03:18:46.599 --> 03:18:51.223]  And there's no way, without the supplements from InForestLife.com, I could do it.
[03:18:51.764 --> 03:19:00.132]  And now, we have, of all our products that are amazing, the ultimate new Farming & Living 8-Pack Power Stack at InForestWare.com.
[03:19:00.992 --> 03:19:02.214]  Total health and performance.

[03:19:10.041 --> 03:19:12.003]  In a world of phonies, folks, InForest is real.

[03:19:22.949 --> 03:19:23.829]  You are tied to mine.
[03:19:23.849 --> 03:19:26.831]  You need to get the 8-pack Power Stack today at m4restore.com.
[03:19:26.851 --> 03:19:28.872]  You need to fund the M4 into the future.
[03:19:29.672 --> 03:19:30.593]  Now the choice is up to you.
[03:19:31.581 --> 03:19:37.844]  Total health and performance in two different packets, AM and PM.
[03:19:38.404 --> 03:19:42.606]  This is the 8-pack PowerStack Daily Care System.
[03:19:43.086 --> 03:19:44.867]  These are the very best
[03:19:46.690 --> 03:19:55.575]  13 capsules, 8 new formulas that we could bring you that just does things for every part of your body, every part of your system.
[03:19:56.456 --> 03:20:01.679]  We looked at the best selling products out there and we made it even better and we lowered the price.
[03:20:06.301 --> 03:20:08.962]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.714 --> 03:20:15.139]  I don't know.
[03:20:29.614 --> 03:20:31.755]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:31.875 --> 03:20:34.177]  I'm Tom Pafford, guest hosting for this fourth hour.
[03:20:34.197 --> 03:20:36.098]  We're going to change gears just slightly.
[03:20:36.118 --> 03:20:42.741]  We're going to talk tech censorship, because there is a development today that I did not honestly expect.
[03:20:42.801 --> 03:20:44.262]  I cover this stuff nonstop.
[03:20:44.582 --> 03:20:48.264]  My Facebook page, God Emperor Trump, has been banned six different times.
[03:20:48.384 --> 03:20:53.707]  And like a phoenix, we rise from the dead, largely with the help of our friends over at InfoWars.
[03:20:53.807 --> 03:20:54.768]  Fantastic people.
[03:20:55.308 --> 03:20:57.269]  But today, a company.
[03:20:57.927 --> 03:21:02.928]  A fitness company announced their decision to boycott Facebook and Instagram.
[03:21:02.948 --> 03:21:04.369]  They're done with the platforms.
[03:21:04.769 --> 03:21:08.390]  And the reasons why, it sounds like they've been watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:21:08.410 --> 03:21:10.530]  We're going to break some of that down, but it's CrossFit.
[03:21:11.091 --> 03:21:12.631]  Who the heck saw this one coming?
[03:21:12.711 --> 03:21:19.493]  CrossFit boycotts Facebook after 1.65 million strong Facebook group is banned.
[03:21:20.322 --> 03:21:25.625]  Who would have thought it would be CrossFit, of all people, that actually takes the stand against Facebook?
[03:21:25.645 --> 03:21:27.467]  I know, I had no idea this was coming.
[03:21:27.507 --> 03:21:34.171]  Who would have thought that this would be the one that actually would step away from these big tech platforms and call them out for what they are?
[03:21:34.531 --> 03:21:35.992]  A globalist spy network!
[03:21:36.556 --> 03:21:37.577]  It's truly astounding.
[03:21:38.497 --> 03:21:49.244]  After the banting seven-day meal plan Facebook group was banned without an explanation, CrossFit announced its decision to end all use of both Facebook and Instagram in an apparent boycott.
[03:21:49.264 --> 03:21:58.530]  According to CrossFit, the group was used by 1.65 million users to share advice, testimonials, and to provide encouragement to users pursuing the CrossFit health plan.
[03:21:58.570 --> 03:22:00.511]  Something Jerry Nadler might want to check out.
[03:22:00.551 --> 03:22:01.472]  I think they could help him.
[03:22:01.512 --> 03:22:02.112]  The poor guy.
[03:22:02.432 --> 03:22:03.193]  I hope he's okay.
[03:22:03.813 --> 03:22:09.496]  So, let's just cross over to their website, because their reasons for doing this are absolutely stunning.
[03:22:09.536 --> 03:22:12.938]  They said, Facebook deleted without warning or explanation our group.
[03:22:13.178 --> 03:22:16.540]  The group had 1.65 million users who post testimonials and other information.
[03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:30.668]  While the site has subsequently reinstated, also without warning or explanation, Facebook's actions should give any serious person reason to pause, especially those of us engaged with activities contrary to the prevailing opinion.
[03:22:31.906 --> 03:22:37.115]  Facebook and its properties host and oversee a significant share of the marketplace of public thought.
[03:22:37.896 --> 03:22:42.964]  In other words, this is me saying this, Tom Pappard, they are the modern public square.
[03:22:43.647 --> 03:22:47.011]  And if you do not agree with what they believe, then you are not welcome in the public square.
[03:22:47.051 --> 03:22:48.833]  That is a direct violation of the First Amendment.
[03:22:48.853 --> 03:22:56.262]  But of course, their lawyers and Mark Zuckerberg in his booster seat, they do a very good job of dancing playfully around that.
[03:22:56.322 --> 03:22:58.965]  They refuse to call themselves the public square.
[03:22:59.145 --> 03:23:01.508]  They also refuse to call themselves a publisher.
[03:23:01.788 --> 03:23:04.491]  They're walking a very thin line to avoid
[03:23:04.551 --> 03:23:06.072]  Let's continue reading from CrossFit.
[03:23:34.400 --> 03:23:36.801]  Which they obviously do not have.
[03:23:37.321 --> 03:23:40.363]  But then Crossfoot does something absolutely fascinating.
[03:23:40.383 --> 03:23:43.524]  And I swear, you read this and it's like you're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:23:43.564 --> 03:23:45.945]  It's like you're reading InfoWars.com.
[03:23:46.485 --> 03:23:54.369]  You are hearing from normal people, totally uninvolved with politics at this point, exactly what's going on.
[03:23:54.429 --> 03:23:56.610]  And I want to turn to point number
[03:23:57.570 --> 03:23:58.790]  One, two, honestly all of them.
[03:23:58.810 --> 03:24:02.211]  They put up a bullet point, eight bullet points of what they believe Facebook is doing.
[03:24:02.251 --> 03:24:08.792]  Facebook collects and aggregates user information and shares it with state and federal authorities, as well as security organizations from other countries.
[03:24:08.852 --> 03:24:09.352]  We know this.
[03:24:09.832 --> 03:24:20.334]  Two, Facebook collaborates with government security agencies on massive civilian surveillance programs such as PRISM.
[03:24:21.634 --> 03:24:26.435]  Did you ever think you would hear a massive truth bomb like this coming from an exercise website?
[03:24:27.489 --> 03:24:35.671]  Facebook censors and removes user accounts based on unknown criteria and at the request of third parties including government and foreign government agencies.
[03:24:36.531 --> 03:24:49.635]  Remember, the reason why Alex Jones' personal Facebook account is gone, the reason why you're not allowed to post a link to InfoWars.com on Facebook, the reason why you're not allowed to post a meme video featuring Alex Jones is because Alex Jones is a hate figure.
[03:24:50.339 --> 03:24:52.460]  And they determined this, so it must be true.
[03:24:52.540 --> 03:24:54.561]  Facebook is judge, jury, and executioner.
[03:24:54.781 --> 03:24:56.482]  They don't have any laws that govern them.
[03:24:57.002 --> 03:24:57.903]  That's the way it works.
[03:24:58.823 --> 03:25:04.506]  So, and by the way, this whole bit about it's unknown, Facebook really gets mad when you talk about that.
[03:25:04.566 --> 03:25:06.226]  I've emailed with top Facebook people.
[03:25:06.266 --> 03:25:11.249]  In fact, I was the first one who really got them to admit straight up what they were doing.
[03:25:11.289 --> 03:25:13.550]  That you can no longer post links to Alex Jones.
[03:25:13.570 --> 03:25:16.031]  You can say, I think Alex Jones is a wonderful person.
[03:25:16.696 --> 03:25:20.999]  But you can't say that very statement and then have a link to an InfoWars video below it.
[03:25:21.039 --> 03:25:22.100]  That gets you banned!
[03:25:22.880 --> 03:25:26.163]  Total, total, absolute insanity.
[03:25:26.483 --> 03:25:33.888]  But they maintain that all of this is publicly available on their public-facing community standards section of the website.
[03:25:33.988 --> 03:25:34.689]  And it's not!
[03:25:35.592 --> 03:25:40.216]  Now, what they need to do, if they're going to seriously go down this rabbit hole, is put up a list.
[03:25:40.737 --> 03:25:41.898]  These are all the hate figures.
[03:25:41.918 --> 03:25:44.020]  You're not allowed to post links to these people's videos.
[03:25:44.040 --> 03:25:46.242]  You're not allowed to say anything too complimentary of them.
[03:25:46.262 --> 03:25:52.267]  And if you post a photo, well, we might remove that too, as Instagram has done in several different instances, and I believe Facebook as well.
[03:25:52.608 --> 03:25:53.989]  But they don't have anything like that.
[03:25:54.029 --> 03:25:58.173]  In fact, they only discuss hate figures in the context of terrorism.
[03:25:59.042 --> 03:26:00.965]  So Alex Jones is essentially a terrorist.
[03:26:01.346 --> 03:26:03.469]  Paul Joseph Watson, the mild-mannered Brit.
[03:26:03.709 --> 03:26:05.372]  Summit.News is his new website.
[03:26:05.713 --> 03:26:08.697]  Well, he's essentially a terrorist.
[03:26:08.978 --> 03:26:10.020]  He's Osama Bin Laden.
[03:26:10.580 --> 03:26:12.744]  Alex Jones is Osama Bin Laden, according to Facebook.
[03:26:13.484 --> 03:26:14.644]  So let's keep reading this list.
[03:26:14.684 --> 03:26:16.065]  It's absolutely fascinating.
[03:26:16.385 --> 03:26:19.826]  Facebook collects, aggregates, and sells user information as a matter of business.
[03:26:20.166 --> 03:26:29.428]  Its business model allows governments and businesses alike to use its algorithmically configured advertising categories as sophisticated data mining and surveillance tools.
[03:26:30.008 --> 03:26:31.169]  Facebook is spying on you.
[03:26:31.209 --> 03:26:32.309]  Facebook is selling you.
[03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:33.249]  You are the product.
[03:26:33.870 --> 03:26:37.110]  And, of course, there are all the conspiracies, and I have no doubt in my mind that it's true.
[03:26:37.130 --> 03:26:40.991]  Facebook listens to you on these little rectangles we have and on your Amazon Echo.
[03:26:41.632 --> 03:26:42.812]  It needs your mic for a reason.
[03:26:43.223 --> 03:26:44.744]  It's not just for Siri.
[03:26:46.225 --> 03:27:00.934]  Facebook's news feeds, get a load of this, are censored and crafted to reflect the political leanings of Facebook's utopian socialists, while remaining vulnerable to misinformation campaigns designed to stir up violence and prejudice.
[03:27:02.011 --> 03:27:15.534]  I just have to stress, folks, this is an exercise website calling out Facebook for being a bunch of utopian socialists who are censoring and crafting their news feed to be all the information they want.
[03:27:16.434 --> 03:27:18.154]  And I get pinged about this all the time.
[03:27:18.194 --> 03:27:25.715]  We have an official group on Facebook where if one user posts fake news, and it can be something that's completely accurate, but Facebook thinks it's fake.
[03:27:26.276 --> 03:27:28.216]  Very rare is it actual fake news.
[03:27:29.275 --> 03:27:34.020]  But they will threaten you with, well, we're not going to put your group in the newsfeed anymore.
[03:27:34.040 --> 03:27:36.703]  We're going to put you at the very bottom of the page so nobody sees you.
[03:27:36.723 --> 03:27:38.785]  We're not going to tell people to join your group anymore.
[03:27:38.805 --> 03:27:39.906]  You're going to be shadow banned.
[03:27:40.347 --> 03:27:44.411]  They're essentially, without using the words, admitting, yes, we're going to shadow ban you.
[03:27:45.020 --> 03:27:46.401]  So you have Facebook admitting this.
[03:27:46.781 --> 03:27:47.562]  Absolutely admitting this.
[03:27:47.922 --> 03:27:54.265]  Facebook, as a matter of business and principle, has weak intellectual property protections and has slowed to close down IP theft accounts.
[03:27:54.566 --> 03:27:56.287]  Facebook has poor security protocols.
[03:27:56.627 --> 03:28:03.651]  And Facebook is acting in the service and food beverage industry interests by banning people like CrossFit.
[03:28:04.424 --> 03:28:12.308]  So, this is a brave stand taken by a massive, massive organization that I think is going to rock Facebook.
[03:28:12.388 --> 03:28:17.010]  I think that this is going to raise some heads in the business world, especially in the health and fitness world.
[03:28:17.470 --> 03:28:23.193]  And I think, even though my revenue, my business depends directly on Facebook, it's the right move.
[03:28:23.883 --> 03:28:24.523]  It's the right move.
[03:28:24.563 --> 03:28:29.425]  If I didn't have to be on Facebook, if I had been as smart as Alex Jones, I might not be there anymore.
[03:28:29.885 --> 03:28:30.725]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[03:28:30.745 --> 03:28:32.786]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:32.806 --> 03:28:35.547]  We're going to be back in just a couple minutes after a short break.
[03:28:36.127 --> 03:28:39.608]  Just to give you an idea of where we're going after this, we've got some more Facebook.
[03:28:39.968 --> 03:28:46.530]  Rufio Panman, the Antifa-smashing, Proud Boy-affiliated individual, his podcast has been banned from Facebook.
[03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:50.491]  We're going to talk and get into great detail about what happened to the Krasenstein brothers.
[03:28:50.831 --> 03:28:52.612]  We're going to talk about how the media
[03:28:53.152 --> 03:28:53.854]  It's a pass.
[03:28:53.914 --> 03:28:55.837]  They do exactly what Alex Jones is accused of doing.
[03:28:56.218 --> 03:28:56.939]  Don't get any blame.
[03:28:57.280 --> 03:28:58.021]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:58.242 --> 03:28:59.424]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:59.444 --> 03:29:00.325]  See you after the break.
[03:29:05.675 --> 03:29:08.738]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[03:29:08.898 --> 03:29:11.921]  Now, we're bringing you an all-new version to help you reach your energy peak.
[03:29:12.101 --> 03:29:19.428]  Ultra 12 from InfoWars Life takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available, methylcobalamin, to provide you with twice the B12.
[03:29:19.608 --> 03:29:26.034]  Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production, and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[03:29:26.155 --> 03:29:29.838]  Take advantage of the superior form of B12 and head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[03:29:38.976 --> 03:29:43.619]  We are launching one of the biggest sales ever on these key particular products.
[03:29:43.879 --> 03:29:44.980]  This is a huge sale.
[03:30:08.956 --> 03:30:09.656]  We're good to go.
[03:30:25.723 --> 03:30:28.906]  Beyond energy drink, beyond pre-workout, beyond post-workout.
[03:30:29.046 --> 03:30:33.750]  Five different types of energy that are healthy and slow burn to hit at different times.
[03:30:33.770 --> 03:30:35.871]  10 hours, really should call it 10 hour energy.
[03:30:35.931 --> 03:30:38.113]  Turbo force on average lasts about 10 hours.
[03:30:38.213 --> 03:30:39.935]  Doesn't have the hangover that others do.
[03:30:39.995 --> 03:30:41.356]  Doesn't have the toxic additives.
[03:30:41.816 --> 03:30:43.037]  40% off TurboForce.
[03:30:43.117 --> 03:30:44.958]  And we have the Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:30:44.978 --> 03:30:46.199]  Again, that's so good for you and your family.
[03:30:46.219 --> 03:30:47.040]  That is a fruit punch.
[03:30:47.080 --> 03:30:47.760]  It's all natural.
[03:30:47.920 --> 03:30:50.482]  And we have chocolate and vanilla bars.
[03:30:50.742 --> 03:30:55.445]  The Vanilla Coconut and Peanut Butter Chocolate Protein Bars that are back in stock.
[03:30:56.066 --> 03:31:00.048]  40% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:00.489 --> 03:31:04.952]  50% off the new 8-pack PowerStack next to DNA Force+.
[03:31:05.132 --> 03:31:06.873]  It has the most product in it.
[03:31:06.933 --> 03:31:11.136]  But quite frankly, all my funding problems would be solved if I dumbed the products down.
[03:31:11.616 --> 03:31:16.358]  Like everybody else does, or almost everybody else does, and then sold stuff for really low prices with almost nothing in them.
[03:31:17.419 --> 03:31:19.080]  Or for higher prices with nothing in them.
[03:31:19.900 --> 03:31:23.402]  This new 8-pack PowerStack is 13 pills.
[03:31:24.042 --> 03:31:26.023]  You take half in the morning, half in the evening.
[03:31:26.083 --> 03:31:34.527]  It's got two different nice packets for each day, so that you have what you need in the morning and what you need in the evening, and it's very easy and portable, and you don't forget to use it.
[03:31:34.667 --> 03:31:35.708]  Everything is in there.
[03:31:35.768 --> 03:31:36.488]  It's incredible.
[03:31:36.588 --> 03:31:38.049]  Document Cam shot, please, for a team of viewers.
[03:31:39.249 --> 03:31:41.391]  And it's got everything in it.
[03:31:41.431 --> 03:31:42.591]  And this way you don't forget it.
[03:31:42.611 --> 03:31:43.732]  This way you can carry it with you.
[03:31:43.832 --> 03:31:47.234]  There is a lot of money that goes in to each one of these boxes.
[03:31:47.434 --> 03:31:48.275]  And they're all in there.
[03:31:48.775 --> 03:31:49.395]  You just boom.
[03:31:49.736 --> 03:31:50.416]  Got your AM.
[03:31:50.876 --> 03:31:51.557]  Got your PM.
[03:31:52.097 --> 03:31:53.658]  It's all right there.
[03:31:54.058 --> 03:31:54.859]  That's our newest product.
[03:31:54.919 --> 03:31:55.939]  I'm very excited about it.
[03:31:56.059 --> 03:31:58.681]  If you're like me, you keep forgetting to take the things you're supposed to take.
[03:31:58.821 --> 03:31:59.602]  It's incredible.
[03:31:59.642 --> 03:32:01.403]  I'm not going to go over everything that's in it.
[03:32:01.503 --> 03:32:04.104]  Flex & Joint Support Energy Kickstart Formula.
[03:32:04.164 --> 03:32:05.085]  Krill Oil Formula.
[03:32:05.185 --> 03:32:13.034]  Nutropic Brain Formula, Green Detox Formula in the AM, the PM, Rest and Recovery, Immune Support Formula, Shown Sleep Formula, Krill Oils.
[03:32:13.054 --> 03:32:13.794]  That's a good day and night.
[03:32:13.874 --> 03:32:15.036]  Bone Support Formula.
[03:32:15.116 --> 03:32:15.476]  Boom!
[03:32:15.616 --> 03:32:16.177]  We're excited.
[03:32:16.357 --> 03:32:16.918]  It's amazing.
[03:32:17.018 --> 03:32:17.899]  Thank you for your support.
[03:32:17.919 --> 03:32:19.180]  50% off so much more.
[03:32:19.300 --> 03:32:20.802]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:32.748 --> 03:32:42.714]  Sometimes in life, your pipes just get a little clogged up, a little backed up, and you just can't get that clearance and that push that you need.
[03:32:42.914 --> 03:32:49.438]  But with Oxy-Powder from InfowarsStore.com, that will no longer be an issue.
[03:32:49.798 --> 03:32:53.380]  But watch out, because this stuff is powerful.
[03:32:53.980 --> 03:33:00.224]  Oxy-Powder from InfowarsStore.com clears those pipes that have been giving you all that backup.
[03:33:06.249 --> 03:33:08.970]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.375 --> 03:33:19.576]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:20.056 --> 03:33:25.199]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:33:28.960 --> 03:33:32.123]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.203 --> 03:33:34.325]  I'm Tom Paffert, guest hosting this hour.
[03:33:34.365 --> 03:33:35.766]  Facebook's gone and pre-Trumped.
[03:33:35.826 --> 03:33:45.114]  At the tail end of the last segment, I mentioned that, you know, I am largely dependent on Facebook and social media, something that Matt Grudge has warned against heavily.
[03:33:45.674 --> 03:33:48.337]  And Alex Jones, he had the means
[03:33:48.977 --> 03:33:55.001]  And the capability and the intelligence to take that warning from Mad Drudge a few years ago here on the broadcast.
[03:33:55.422 --> 03:34:01.886]  And he created, well he already had it, but he doubled down on his own website, InfoWars.com.
[03:34:01.906 --> 03:34:04.969]  And you can watch all the videos at InfoWars.com slash show.
[03:34:05.349 --> 03:34:09.912]  There's still an app for Android if you're lucky and you got it before Apple took it out of the App Store.
[03:34:09.992 --> 03:34:12.714]  It's on some Apple devices, some.
[03:34:12.814 --> 03:34:13.395]  I've still got it.
[03:34:13.515 --> 03:34:14.155]  Lucky, lucky me.
[03:34:14.195 --> 03:34:15.196]  Never gonna get rid of this phone.
[03:34:15.676 --> 03:34:16.737]  It's a collector's item now.
[03:34:17.438 --> 03:34:17.638]  But,
[03:34:18.354 --> 03:34:20.996]  In order to do this, I can speak from experience.
[03:34:21.056 --> 03:34:23.377]  I work in television, KCTU-TV 5.
[03:34:23.717 --> 03:34:25.759]  It's the affiliate I'm affiliated with.
[03:34:26.859 --> 03:34:33.703]  And it takes so much financial giving to make this work, to have your own hosting.
[03:34:33.743 --> 03:34:35.064]  YouTube has never turned a profit.
[03:34:35.765 --> 03:34:38.446]  YouTube is a loss leader for Google.
[03:34:38.646 --> 03:34:39.327]  Doesn't make money.
[03:34:39.707 --> 03:34:40.648]  Does not make money.
[03:34:41.608 --> 03:34:43.349]  And that's because of the video hosting.
[03:34:43.569 --> 03:34:45.230]  That's because it costs a fortune.
[03:34:45.811 --> 03:34:45.951]  So
[03:34:46.644 --> 03:34:52.766]  Now more than ever, Alex Jones, InfoWars, everybody on this fantastic platform, the crew, they need your support.
[03:34:52.826 --> 03:34:56.247]  And there are some tremendous Memorial Day sales going on right now.
[03:34:56.627 --> 03:34:58.687]  I was just looking them over during the commercial break.
[03:34:58.727 --> 03:35:04.469]  They've got 60% off ExtendoWise, 60% off MycoZX Plus.
[03:35:04.709 --> 03:35:07.370]  They've got an all-new 8-pack PowerStack.
[03:35:08.131 --> 03:35:08.752]  50% off.
[03:35:08.972 --> 03:35:13.219]  Super Male Vitality, which is probably my favorite product, is 50% off.
[03:35:13.340 --> 03:35:16.605]  Ultimate Bone Broth Bodies, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, all 50% off.
[03:35:16.946 --> 03:35:18.449]  Turbo Force, which I think
[03:35:19.258 --> 03:35:23.582]  It's almost, I don't know, it's either as good or maybe a little bit better than BrainForce.
[03:35:23.602 --> 03:35:24.683]  But I do love BrainForce.
[03:35:24.703 --> 03:35:26.865]  I would not have graduated college without BrainForce.
[03:35:26.905 --> 03:35:28.106]  I stand by that statement.
[03:35:28.606 --> 03:35:29.307]  But it's 50% off.
[03:35:29.907 --> 03:35:31.989]  Bodies is 50, I'm sorry, 40% off.
[03:35:32.109 --> 03:35:36.072]  And the chocolate, peanut butter, and vanilla coconut protein bars are 40% off.
[03:35:36.112 --> 03:35:36.873]  I'd love to try those.
[03:35:36.933 --> 03:35:38.094]  Super Silver Wound Gel is 40% off.
[03:35:39.455 --> 03:35:43.100]  You can get $50 off an Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:35:43.621 --> 03:35:46.024]  Let me tell you folks, I live in a dusty old building.
[03:35:46.044 --> 03:35:48.087]  There may or may not be some asbestos.
[03:35:48.147 --> 03:35:49.849]  They didn't rip up the floor, so they don't know.
[03:35:50.410 --> 03:35:51.231]  Very old building.
[03:35:51.251 --> 03:35:56.378]  I am terrible, terribly allergic to everything that grows in God's green earth.
[03:35:56.858 --> 03:36:01.762]  And without an Alexa Pure Breeze, I don't know if I'd be able to do this show right now.
[03:36:02.103 --> 03:36:04.965]  I'd be blowing my nose in every commercial break, and the crew can back me up.
[03:36:05.465 --> 03:36:06.826]  Haven't had to do it once.
[03:36:07.167 --> 03:36:07.907]  Haven't had to do it once.
[03:36:07.947 --> 03:36:11.370]  So take advantage of these tremendous sales this Memorial Day.
[03:36:11.670 --> 03:36:15.273]  Celebrate Memorial Day by helping lead the fight.
[03:36:15.554 --> 03:36:21.819]  InfoWars is the tip of the spear, and with great deals like these, it makes it easy, easy, easy to do so.
[03:36:24.855 --> 03:36:26.036]  You keep InfoWars going.
[03:36:26.176 --> 03:36:29.640]  You keep Owen Schreier, who's going to be hosting the War Room coming up in the next hour.
[03:36:29.940 --> 03:36:30.881]  You keep him going.
[03:36:30.901 --> 03:36:32.062]  You keep David Knight going.
[03:36:32.082 --> 03:36:34.945]  You keep the crew well-fed and happy.
[03:36:35.586 --> 03:36:50.521]  And it's a whole lot better, I speak from experience, to know that you are helping the people who help this country than when you go to Whole Foods or you go to Costco or you go to the local GNC or whatever your supplement store is and stock up there.
[03:36:50.961 --> 03:36:55.946]  I know that sometimes I cheat and I'll get the Alexa Pure Breeze filters.
[03:36:56.684 --> 03:36:57.525]  From Amazon.
[03:36:57.845 --> 03:36:59.526]  And when I do it, you just feel dirty.
[03:36:59.746 --> 03:37:01.087]  You don't save hardly any money.
[03:37:01.287 --> 03:37:03.849]  You get maybe a little bit faster shipping, if you're lucky.
[03:37:04.169 --> 03:37:05.570]  And the UPS knows where you live.
[03:37:06.030 --> 03:37:07.431]  Maybe a little bit faster shipping.
[03:37:07.471 --> 03:37:08.612]  Costs the same amount of money.
[03:37:08.952 --> 03:37:11.093]  And I'm giving my money to Jeff Bezos.
[03:37:11.614 --> 03:37:15.176]  Why would you want to give your money to the guy who owns the Washington Compost?
[03:37:15.376 --> 03:37:17.017]  It totally baffles me.
[03:37:17.438 --> 03:37:18.438]  And so I try not to do it.
[03:37:18.458 --> 03:37:19.619]  Maybe once or twice I have.
[03:37:19.699 --> 03:37:22.481]  But we're going to talk Facebook censorship.
[03:37:22.921 --> 03:37:24.402]  And social media censorship.
[03:37:24.442 --> 03:37:25.183]  And tech censorship.
[03:37:26.391 --> 03:37:28.533]  Really, Alex Jones is a genius.
[03:37:28.893 --> 03:37:29.874]  He's like President Trump.
[03:37:29.914 --> 03:37:34.758]  He is a very stable genius to have his own platform where nobody can shut him down.
[03:37:35.018 --> 03:37:37.920]  The only way they can shut him down is by driving him out of business.
[03:37:38.461 --> 03:37:39.121]  And they're trying.
[03:37:39.201 --> 03:37:40.142]  I have no doubt in my mind.
[03:37:40.182 --> 03:37:41.663]  They want us all out of business.
[03:37:41.703 --> 03:37:43.565]  They want us all dead, if they could get it.
[03:37:43.625 --> 03:37:45.286]  But they'll settle for bankrupt.
[03:37:45.894 --> 03:37:57.823]  So as I said, it's very important to go to InfoWarsStore.com, take advantage of the Memorial Day Sale, but let's talk about the people who didn't have the ability, the intelligence, the financial backing that Alex Jones does.
[03:37:58.183 --> 03:38:02.527]  Let's talk about the Titans of Liberty with Rufio Panman and Jason Lowe.
[03:38:02.927 --> 03:38:09.072]  I know you've probably heard about them if you've been watching The War Room, but they've now been taken off of Facebook.
[03:38:09.332 --> 03:38:14.336]  I hesitate to even call it a ban because it wasn't a ban as much as it was an outright purge.
[03:38:15.410 --> 03:38:17.172]  So they host this conservative podcast.
[03:38:17.212 --> 03:38:18.454]  Rufio Panman is the guy.
[03:38:18.514 --> 03:38:26.664]  You can't really do it justice in a suit, but he decked that Antifa loser, allegedly, and the glasses, they say, are still in orbit.
[03:38:26.864 --> 03:38:31.951]  His sunglasses went flying off his face, and they say that it is in a low Earth orbit after Rufio Panman.
[03:38:33.968 --> 03:38:36.750]  What Facebook did is something fairly unique.
[03:38:36.810 --> 03:38:39.832]  It happened to me once, and again, thanks to my friends at InfoWars.
[03:38:39.912 --> 03:38:41.032]  I still have a Facebook page.
[03:38:41.052 --> 03:38:41.873]  God, Emperor Trump.
[03:38:41.913 --> 03:38:50.658]  But instead of, okay, you're going to get hit with a 30-day ban because you said something bad that we disagree with, you put a little wrong thing out there.
[03:38:51.078 --> 03:38:53.259]  Instead of doing that, just poof!
[03:38:54.200 --> 03:38:54.760]  Totally gone!
[03:38:55.020 --> 03:38:55.901]  Gone from the platform.
[03:38:56.601 --> 03:38:57.422]  Nobody was punished.
[03:38:57.962 --> 03:38:59.783]  The users, the admins, they didn't get a ban.
[03:39:00.804 --> 03:39:02.545]  Nobody explained what they did wrong.
[03:39:03.200 --> 03:39:05.601]  Instead, the page just no longer exists.
[03:39:06.342 --> 03:39:08.083]  It's been shoved down the memory hole.
[03:39:09.784 --> 03:39:13.386]  And this is the type of thing that we have to hold these people accountable.
[03:39:13.906 --> 03:39:17.348]  And so I'm glad that I could get in touch with Mr. Lowe, the co-host of the podcast.
[03:39:17.708 --> 03:39:21.170]  I'm happy I could get in touch with him and discuss this, but this is absolutely baffling.
[03:39:21.210 --> 03:39:24.992]  He said to us, the page disappeared out of thin air and it's just gone.
[03:39:25.012 --> 03:39:29.534]  No warning, no nothing, no reason at all.
[03:39:30.855 --> 03:39:32.616]  And I hope that these individuals have used
[03:39:33.471 --> 03:39:38.852]  President Trump's new tech censorship reporting tool.
[03:39:40.112 --> 03:39:41.773]  And I hope that everybody out there is.
[03:39:42.233 --> 03:39:46.454]  Because this is just one story out of probably tens or even hundreds of thousands at this point.
[03:39:46.814 --> 03:39:47.894]  And it happens every day.
[03:39:48.694 --> 03:39:53.575]  This is another just call and begging to my fellow people on social media.
[03:39:53.915 --> 03:39:56.276]  If this happens to you, tell everybody.
[03:39:56.956 --> 03:40:00.957]  Don't just shrug and say, well, guess I'm not allowed on Facebook anymore.
[03:40:01.929 --> 03:40:04.431]  Be as Alex Jones-ian as you can.
[03:40:04.711 --> 03:40:11.636]  Not everybody can go to the White House with a bullhorn and shout directly at the President as he meets with Twitter Jack.
[03:40:12.877 --> 03:40:14.319]  Not everybody has that capability.
[03:40:14.639 --> 03:40:18.161]  Not everybody has the guts to do what Alex Jones does, and that's perfectly fine.
[03:40:18.201 --> 03:40:21.744]  But we in the conservative media, we want to tell your story.
[03:40:22.144 --> 03:40:24.306]  We want to put a magnifying glass on this.
[03:40:25.107 --> 03:40:26.888]  And the President now wants to hear it as well.
[03:40:27.829 --> 03:40:30.611]  Because this is the crisis of our time.
[03:40:31.653 --> 03:40:46.299]  The First Amendment, when you put Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey and the Vijaya woman, whatever her name is over at Twitter, when you put them in the judge, jury, and executioner seats, there is no justice.
[03:40:46.339 --> 03:40:47.299]  There is no process.
[03:40:47.319 --> 03:40:51.421]  There is literally no process for the Titans of Liberty podcast run by Panman and Lowe.
[03:40:51.881 --> 03:40:53.822]  There's no process whatsoever.
[03:40:53.882 --> 03:40:56.623]  Just one day they wake up and the Facebook page is gone.
[03:40:57.424 --> 03:40:58.184]  Kind of like one day
[03:40:58.911 --> 03:41:02.033]  Facebook decides Alex Jones is a hate figure!
[03:41:02.653 --> 03:41:03.633]  And Alex Jones is gone.
[03:41:04.814 --> 03:41:19.241]  One day I wake up, I swear that if I were a lefty, if I were one of these triggered, blue-haired, insane people, I would be screaming that I have PTSD because rarely does a day go by where I don't wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning out of breath and the first thing I do is, where's my phone?
[03:41:19.261 --> 03:41:19.661]  Where's my phone?
[03:41:19.681 --> 03:41:20.542]  Do I have a Facebook page?
[03:41:21.302 --> 03:41:23.462]  And Paul Joseph Watson says he does the same exact thing.
[03:41:23.502 --> 03:41:32.864]  He wakes up every morning and the first thing he does before he combs his hair, before he talks to his family, before he returns any calls or checks his emails, is the YouTube page still there.
[03:41:32.904 --> 03:41:34.144]  Do I still have a YouTube channel?
[03:41:34.164 --> 03:41:35.405]  Okay, we've got a YouTube channel.
[03:41:35.445 --> 03:41:36.125]  Still in business.
[03:41:36.765 --> 03:41:38.645]  And this is a terrible, terrible paradigm.
[03:41:39.205 --> 03:41:41.446]  And I'm very encouraged that President Trump is acting.
[03:41:41.466 --> 03:41:47.727]  And I do wonder, and we're going to be getting into this more in the next segment, but I do wonder if
[03:41:48.365 --> 03:41:49.646]  The Krasenstein Brothers?
[03:41:50.066 --> 03:41:51.567]  Are they a sacrificial lamb?
[03:41:52.528 --> 03:41:54.510]  Are they Twitter flexing its power?
[03:41:55.170 --> 03:41:56.851]  Are they seeing what they can get away with?
[03:41:58.012 --> 03:41:59.693]  Or did these guys actually break the rules?
[03:42:00.834 --> 03:42:01.234]  I don't know.
[03:42:02.235 --> 03:42:02.575]  I don't know.
[03:42:02.595 --> 03:42:07.479]  I'm going to share some of my theories and we're going to give you the facts that we know because Twitter has banned the Krasenstein Brothers.
[03:42:07.519 --> 03:42:15.365]  And for those who don't know, they're these two little trolls who, they're brothers, and they are in every single one of President Trump's tweets.
[03:42:17.384 --> 03:42:19.725]  It's their full 9-to-5 job!
[03:42:20.165 --> 03:42:23.906]  They respond to President Trump's tweets to say something derogatory whenever possible.
[03:42:24.326 --> 03:42:25.247]  And now they've been banned!
[03:42:25.907 --> 03:42:31.649]  Allegedly, they bought fake engagement, and they might have fake people following their now-defunct accounts.
[03:42:32.349 --> 03:42:37.170]  And so, on one hand, if they broke this rule, well, you know, that's a real rule.
[03:42:37.710 --> 03:42:40.991]  They didn't just get named a hate figure and shove down the memory hole.
[03:42:41.492 --> 03:42:45.533]  But on the other hand, the First Amendment and freedom of speech
[03:42:46.332 --> 03:42:47.233]  Should be for everyone.
[03:42:48.455 --> 03:42:51.939]  Even these two strange looking little losers.
[03:42:52.500 --> 03:42:53.441]  So I'm Tom Paffert.
[03:42:53.481 --> 03:42:54.723]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:54.743 --> 03:42:55.644]  We're in the fourth hour.
[03:42:55.664 --> 03:42:56.585]  I'm going to be right back.
[03:42:56.605 --> 03:42:59.589]  We're going to talk more tech censorship and some other news of the day.
[03:43:05.999 --> 03:43:10.685]  Just into CNN, Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platforms.
[03:43:10.705 --> 03:43:16.151]  Among them, right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, as well as his media outlet, InfoWars.
[03:43:16.452 --> 03:43:25.343]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[03:43:26.175 --> 03:43:33.739]  Yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[03:43:33.979 --> 03:43:35.019]  I want them shut down.
[03:43:35.079 --> 03:43:36.000]  I want them silenced.
[03:43:36.040 --> 03:43:36.820]  I want them muted.
[03:43:36.860 --> 03:43:38.701]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:43:38.981 --> 03:43:46.285]  Why is there this unprecedented feeding frenzy happening when it comes to InfoWars and yours truly?
[03:43:46.925 --> 03:43:48.346]  Why is there this pile on?
[03:43:49.606 --> 03:43:54.128]  Well, it's not because Trump is the InfoWars presidency.
[03:43:55.209 --> 03:43:55.329]  No.
[03:43:56.540 --> 03:44:02.082]  It's because Trump is trying to execute the Americana presidency.
[03:44:02.702 --> 03:44:03.663]  He's trying to reboot it.
[03:44:03.803 --> 03:44:04.603]  And yes, it's true.
[03:44:06.064 --> 03:44:15.407]  InfoWars, and my syndicated radio and TV show, and our internet reach, literally thanks to you, you're 90% of it.
[03:44:15.907 --> 03:44:20.389]  You have relaunched a global populist movement.
[03:44:21.576 --> 03:44:28.548]  And the establishment thinks if they can destroy me and my name, they can discredit the liberty movement, the populist movement.
[03:44:28.848 --> 03:44:29.770]  That's not going to happen.
[03:44:31.092 --> 03:44:32.514]  But I will be honest with you.
[03:44:33.527 --> 03:44:47.659]  Selfishly, I would like to continue this operation and I'd like to continue to keep our crew members employed and I would like to stay in the fight and keep taking the globalist on and hopefully contribute meaningfully again in the future.
[03:44:48.841 --> 03:44:53.264]  I understand that just to have the success we've had relaunching Americana
[03:44:54.205 --> 03:45:00.651]  And Liberty Worldwide, once in a lifetime, that was hitting the lottery culturally, politically, spiritually.
[03:45:00.951 --> 03:45:01.972]  I'm very thankful to God.
[03:45:02.092 --> 03:45:02.693]  I'm not bitching.
[03:45:03.273 --> 03:45:03.974]  I'm not a victim.
[03:45:04.554 --> 03:45:05.275]  I'm not a loser.
[03:45:06.316 --> 03:45:07.257]  I signed on to this.
[03:45:07.417 --> 03:45:08.218]  I knew the dangers.
[03:45:09.839 --> 03:45:10.980]  I just want to stay in the fight.
[03:45:12.041 --> 03:45:18.707]  It's like saying to the coach, coach, please put me into the game and I'll do a great job.
[03:45:18.727 --> 03:45:20.509]  I don't want to use a
[03:45:22.014 --> 03:45:27.817]  Parallel to the greatest player of all time in the NFL, a certain quarterback with the New England Patriots.
[03:45:28.738 --> 03:45:31.780]  But, you know, he could barely get put in in college.
[03:45:31.800 --> 03:45:36.622]  And even when he finally was put in and did nothing but win, they still weren't sure about it.
[03:45:38.043 --> 03:45:38.764]  That's football.
[03:45:40.024 --> 03:45:42.686]  When it comes to Americana and anti-globalism,
[03:45:43.843 --> 03:45:49.409]  InfoWars, as an operation, is the greatest player of all time.
[03:45:50.029 --> 03:45:52.412]  It's not me, it's all of us together.
[03:45:53.053 --> 03:45:58.158]  And the globalists recognize that, and they want to keep us out of the game.
[03:45:59.639 --> 03:46:02.863]  So please, for yourself, for myself, for everybody.
[03:46:04.404 --> 03:46:06.565]  I don't want them to be successful shutting us down.
[03:46:06.585 --> 03:46:09.607]  I don't want them to be successful having them take us off the air.
[03:46:10.528 --> 03:46:14.770]  You can stop their deplatforming with text messages, with emails, with word of mouth.
[03:46:15.250 --> 03:46:18.292]  It makes them so angry because they can't silence you.
[03:46:19.133 --> 03:46:20.914]  The fact that you're resisting them and winning.
[03:46:21.654 --> 03:46:28.158]  And they can't stop you supporting the broadcast financially, which so many of you have done.
[03:46:30.213 --> 03:46:33.036]  Please, we have the best supplements.
[03:46:33.717 --> 03:46:36.219]  We have great t-shirts, we have great books, we have great films.
[03:46:36.600 --> 03:46:38.422]  We have great products, thousands of them.
[03:46:38.962 --> 03:46:48.292]  And if you'll just go check out the air filtration, the water filtration, all good things you need, and buy some of the products and try them out, that will change the world.
[03:46:49.486 --> 03:46:52.028]  I am in your hands, and you are in your hands.
[03:46:52.729 --> 03:46:56.011]  We'll hang together or hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said.
[03:46:56.551 --> 03:47:01.235]  Please visit infowarestore.com today, and please continue to support the InfoWar.
[03:47:01.395 --> 03:47:01.755]  Thank you.
[03:47:06.278 --> 03:47:08.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:28.200 --> 03:47:30.220]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:30.260 --> 03:47:31.341]  This is the fourth hour.
[03:47:31.441 --> 03:47:36.862]  I'm your guest host, Tom Pappard, Facebook's God-Emperor Trump, and we've been talking tech censorship.
[03:47:36.902 --> 03:47:38.222]  I want to do a little bit more of that.
[03:47:38.522 --> 03:47:49.865]  We'll talk about the media, a well-known leftist media outlet allegedly doing exactly what everyone says they banned Alex Jones for, and then I want to talk a little bit about what's going on with the left.
[03:47:49.925 --> 03:47:54.286]  These poor, sick, sick people, and I don't mean even necessarily mentally sick.
[03:47:54.346 --> 03:47:56.006]  I mean physically ill.
[03:47:56.767 --> 03:47:59.548]  My heart would go out to them if they weren't so dang evil.
[03:48:00.748 --> 03:48:03.189]  So, Twitter has banned the Krasenstein brothers.
[03:48:03.509 --> 03:48:04.349]  The two twins.
[03:48:04.689 --> 03:48:10.031]  The Twitter trolls who haunt President Trump's Twitter, saying anything they can to make him look bad.
[03:48:10.351 --> 03:48:10.831]  Impleech.
[03:48:11.131 --> 03:48:11.491]  Blumpf.
[03:48:11.932 --> 03:48:14.472]  Seems to be their rallying cry.
[03:48:14.692 --> 03:48:16.493]  They were banned yesterday evening.
[03:48:16.733 --> 03:48:21.115]  The accounts of the well-known Twitter trolls Ed and Brian Krasenstein were both suspended.
[03:48:21.135 --> 03:48:27.717]  The two became famous and infamous for their constant replies to President Donald Trump's Twitter feed, usually with calls for his impeachment.
[03:48:27.737 --> 03:48:32.899]  And between the two, they had nearly 2 million Twitter followers and were often the top response.
[03:48:33.499 --> 03:48:34.319]  To Trump's tweets.
[03:48:34.920 --> 03:48:38.721]  And now with their suspensions we may know why they were always those top response.
[03:48:38.961 --> 03:48:45.744]  People would be baffled and scratching their heads and how come there is always a leftist who gets the top response to President Trump's tweet?
[03:48:45.764 --> 03:48:54.487]  They can respond five minutes after Trump's tweet, there can be a conservative with twice the number of engagements and then BAM there's the Krasenstein brothers with their 50,000 likes.
[03:48:56.747 --> 03:49:01.450]  Twitter says they bought that engagement, which is a well-known practice.
[03:49:01.971 --> 03:49:02.711]  A lot of people do it.
[03:49:03.192 --> 03:49:12.358]  There's a fake or real thing you can use, a tool that's been released, where you can actually see how many Twitter users on any given account, how many followers, are fake versus real.
[03:49:12.378 --> 03:49:14.640]  And President Trump scores quite well in that, by the way.
[03:49:14.700 --> 03:49:17.362]  He has a lot of very real Twitter followers.
[03:49:18.129 --> 03:49:20.950]  But according to a Twitter spokesperson, this is what Twitter had to say.
[03:49:20.970 --> 03:49:21.790]  Let's just read it that way.
[03:49:22.190 --> 03:49:26.492]  Operating multiple fake accounts and purchasing accounts interactions are strictly prohibited.
[03:49:27.072 --> 03:49:31.053]  Engaging in these behaviors will result in permanent suspension from the service.
[03:49:31.693 --> 03:49:33.854]  The Krasenstein brothers specifically denied this.
[03:49:34.614 --> 03:49:38.875]  They said they never purchased accounts interactions and never sold usernames or bought usernames.
[03:49:38.895 --> 03:49:44.817]  They said they did operate multiple accounts because they had multiple businesses, but they were not used to mislead or manipulate Twitter.
[03:49:46.010 --> 03:49:55.032]  And they said that over the last two and a half years, as their tweets became more and more political in nature, people began posting their phone numbers and doxing them and issuing death threats.
[03:49:55.752 --> 03:50:00.873]  And so they had to use these fake accounts because they wanted to keep tabs on the people who were threatening them.
[03:50:00.913 --> 03:50:03.254]  That, to me, sounds like an exercise in masochism.
[03:50:03.294 --> 03:50:13.996]  But I just want to point out that a week or two ago, the very popular Twitter meme lord, Carpe Danktum, was banned from Twitter.
[03:50:14.036 --> 03:50:14.476]  Suspended.
[03:50:15.222 --> 03:50:25.009]  Because he posted a video that showed President Donald Trump and Jim Acosta of CNN in a Old West style shootout scene.
[03:50:25.029 --> 03:50:28.392]  It was obviously a funny meme and it was posted originally in January.
[03:50:29.072 --> 03:50:36.858]  But the Krasenstein brothers put it within their crosshairs and they decided to encourage their followers to report it and get it gone.
[03:50:36.918 --> 03:50:38.039]  Remove it from the platform.
[03:50:39.100 --> 03:50:40.261]  And they were successful.
[03:50:41.035 --> 03:50:42.236]  They're pretty much successful.
[03:50:42.276 --> 03:50:43.636]  Carpe Donctum was suspended.
[03:50:44.017 --> 03:50:45.718]  The tweet later disappeared.
[03:50:46.018 --> 03:50:48.139]  I don't think he deleted it, but the tweet disappeared.
[03:50:48.599 --> 03:50:50.200]  The video is no longer available.
[03:50:50.860 --> 03:50:52.701]  And the Krasenstein brothers were gloating over it.
[03:50:52.741 --> 03:50:55.243]  And so that just makes one wonder.
[03:50:56.483 --> 03:50:59.245]  This targeted harassment campaign that they led
[03:51:00.140 --> 03:51:04.583]  Were they aiding it with the help of purchased engagement?
[03:51:05.123 --> 03:51:15.569]  Were they paying somebody to mass report this video so Twitter would take it down and punish the meme maker that President Trump retweets all the time?
[03:51:16.250 --> 03:51:17.290]  It does make you wonder.
[03:51:18.171 --> 03:51:21.473]  But I also wonder, is this the right way to handle it?
[03:51:22.042 --> 03:51:23.243]  I mean, they broke Twitter's rules.
[03:51:23.283 --> 03:51:25.024]  They did something that was objectively wrong.
[03:51:25.084 --> 03:51:26.465]  Nobody's going to argue against that.
[03:51:27.005 --> 03:51:29.867]  But do they lose their First Amendment because of that?
[03:51:30.107 --> 03:51:31.628]  Is that the right way to handle it?
[03:51:32.509 --> 03:51:45.878]  Maybe instead, delete some of their more egregious examples of using this, delete some of their very popular tweets that were artificially boosted, make them agree to never do it again, and let them have their dang First Amendment.
[03:51:46.536 --> 03:51:53.021]  But on the other hand, these are the people who gloat every single time a conservative, a real Republican is banned or shadow banned.
[03:51:53.041 --> 03:51:54.221]  They're very happy about it.
[03:51:54.261 --> 03:51:56.443]  They think it's the best thing in the world.
[03:51:56.523 --> 03:51:58.584]  So I'm not too broken up.
[03:51:58.945 --> 03:51:59.865]  I'm just not.
[03:51:59.925 --> 03:52:00.666]  Maybe that's wrong.
[03:52:00.986 --> 03:52:01.627]  Maybe that's wrong.
[03:52:01.667 --> 03:52:02.647]  But I'm not too broken up.
[03:52:02.707 --> 03:52:04.529]  So let's turn now to
[03:52:05.863 --> 03:52:06.263]  8chan.
[03:52:06.684 --> 03:52:09.445]  It's a free speech image board.
[03:52:10.026 --> 03:52:12.407]  Sometimes people will post zany things on there.
[03:52:13.328 --> 03:52:14.989]  Things that I don't necessarily agree with.
[03:52:15.029 --> 03:52:16.289]  Things that Alex wouldn't agree with.
[03:52:16.509 --> 03:52:18.631]  But, you know, they also post things that we would agree with.
[03:52:18.651 --> 03:52:20.672]  They also post things that the left might agree with.
[03:52:21.853 --> 03:52:29.917]  And the 8chan founder is speaking out after photos appear to show Vice News reporters breaking into his home.
[03:52:31.178 --> 03:52:34.300]  Now, remember what they said about Alex Jones.
[03:52:34.946 --> 03:52:38.448]  Just rewind your timeline a little bit if you can.
[03:52:38.949 --> 03:52:46.333]  And remember, they said that Alex Jones is sending people to houses of shooting survivors with guns to attack them.
[03:52:48.314 --> 03:52:51.757]  Well, that's exactly what Vice News is accused of doing.
[03:52:51.897 --> 03:52:55.539]  Except instead of guns, they brought cameras going to people's houses.
[03:52:56.800 --> 03:53:03.064]  Alex Jones was totally unpersoned, totally deplatformed for this, but when Vice News is alleged to have done it,
[03:53:04.042 --> 03:53:04.583]  That's fine.
[03:53:05.063 --> 03:53:06.624]  We don't like that 8chan guy.
[03:53:06.664 --> 03:53:08.406]  He's an enemy of the Deep State.
[03:53:08.446 --> 03:53:10.368]  He's a First Amendment advocate.
[03:53:10.408 --> 03:53:11.469]  So get him gone.
[03:53:11.489 --> 03:53:12.209]  That's fine.
[03:53:12.229 --> 03:53:12.590]  That's fine.
[03:53:12.650 --> 03:53:13.330]  Dox him.
[03:53:13.651 --> 03:53:15.512]  Go to his house with his kids there.
[03:53:15.773 --> 03:53:16.533]  Take photos.
[03:53:16.593 --> 03:53:17.514]  Bring a camera crew.
[03:53:17.574 --> 03:53:19.035]  Break your way into his bedroom.
[03:53:19.296 --> 03:53:19.936]  It's fine.
[03:53:20.297 --> 03:53:21.077]  It's just fine.
[03:53:21.778 --> 03:53:24.240]  The thing is, nobody can ever substantiate that with Alex Jones.
[03:53:24.280 --> 03:53:25.621]  He never said to do that.
[03:53:26.322 --> 03:53:27.083]  Never said to do that.
[03:53:28.144 --> 03:53:28.364]  But...
[03:53:29.212 --> 03:53:33.373]  This actually is alleged to have happened, and there's surveillance footage.
[03:53:33.973 --> 03:53:41.055]  The guy put up a tweet saying, this person with a filmmaking crew just broke and entered into Jim's bedroom and were ordered out of the property.
[03:53:41.415 --> 03:53:44.236]  She and her producer have now protected their tweets.
[03:53:44.276 --> 03:53:49.598]  In other words, they got allegedly caught, and now they're scared.
[03:53:49.638 --> 03:53:51.518]  They realize that this doesn't look good for them.
[03:53:51.578 --> 03:53:54.439]  They realize that this is something that crazy people do.
[03:53:55.802 --> 03:53:57.143]  That Alex Jones says to do.
[03:53:57.503 --> 03:53:58.483]  Except he never did.
[03:53:58.923 --> 03:54:07.106]  So Jim Watkins, the owner of the controversial free speech 8chan, has released a video on YouTube accusing liberal journalists from Vice News of illegally entering his home in the Philippines.
[03:54:07.486 --> 03:54:19.591]  He talked about Nazi Germany and the US treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II in the video as examples similar to the crime committed by these so-called journalists, who he called the equivalent of the brown shirt... brown shirts...
[03:54:20.412 --> 03:54:21.373]  At his domicile, he said,
[03:54:30.353 --> 03:54:32.834]  He also said, when I confronted them, I was completely shocked!
[03:54:33.555 --> 03:54:37.937]  I had already told the same employees of Vice News that, quote, no, I did not want to be interviewed by them.
[03:54:38.197 --> 03:54:39.938]  They had no right to be in my home.
[03:54:39.958 --> 03:54:44.200]  And he also said he is apparently a staunch supporter of firearm owning.
[03:54:44.840 --> 03:54:50.383]  He's an American citizen living in the Philippines, so they don't quite have a First Amendment, but Rodrigo Duterte definitely likes guns.
[03:54:50.443 --> 03:54:51.243]  We'll just put it that way.
[03:54:51.263 --> 03:54:59.407]  So he said they were lucky to be alive, because he may have reacted incredibly differently had his children not been in the home
[03:55:00.342 --> 03:55:02.443]  When this alleged breaking and entering occurred.
[03:55:03.404 --> 03:55:05.926]  And so, this should infuriate people.
[03:55:05.986 --> 03:55:12.029]  You have Vice News accused of doing what they accused Alex Jones of doing.
[03:55:12.470 --> 03:55:13.350]  Well, ban Vice News.
[03:55:13.410 --> 03:55:15.131]  Vice News must be taken off the internet now.
[03:55:15.151 --> 03:55:15.872]  That is the rule.
[03:55:16.412 --> 03:55:17.152]  That is the rule.
[03:55:17.193 --> 03:55:18.313]  Where is Oliver Darcy?
[03:55:18.794 --> 03:55:19.414]  Oliver Darcy.
[03:55:19.434 --> 03:55:20.795]  We're paging Oliver Darcy.
[03:55:21.075 --> 03:55:24.197]  Where is your campaign to get Vice News taken off the internet?
[03:55:24.277 --> 03:55:25.718]  I demand it now!
[03:55:27.078 --> 03:55:28.785]  No, Vice News is one of the good ones.
[03:55:28.826 --> 03:55:31.196]  They're a good little progressive leftist outlet.
[03:55:31.880 --> 03:55:33.441]  So, they're protected.
[03:55:33.481 --> 03:55:34.142]  They're just fine.
[03:55:34.162 --> 03:55:35.323]  They can do whatever they want.
[03:55:35.423 --> 03:55:42.109]  So, with our last couple minutes here, I want to turn over and show what's going on with these crazy, crazy leftists.
[03:55:42.129 --> 03:55:49.955]  We already had Nashie Haloshi, who talks like she's either drunk, on pills, dentures falling out, or has Alzheimer's.
[03:55:50.416 --> 03:55:53.078]  Or, as a great friend of mine said, maybe all.
[03:55:53.178 --> 03:55:53.939]  Maybe all of the above.
[03:55:54.079 --> 03:55:55.000]  Check all the boxes.
[03:55:55.280 --> 03:55:56.241]  Perhaps check all the boxes.
[03:55:56.261 --> 03:55:58.463]  Well, now, Jerry Nadler, today,
[03:55:59.352 --> 03:56:08.458]  Another insane leftist passed out, or at least appeared to pass out, and they said, oh, it was stuffy in the room and he was dehydrated.
[03:56:08.658 --> 03:56:09.039]  Stuffy.
[03:56:09.079 --> 03:56:10.439]  Just a little hot.
[03:56:10.580 --> 03:56:11.140]  Just a little hot.
[03:56:11.500 --> 03:56:19.646]  It harkens back to when Hillary Clinton got overheated in a horrible, scorching 68 degree day.
[03:56:20.186 --> 03:56:20.626]  Overheated.
[03:56:21.367 --> 03:56:22.868]  There's something wrong with these leftists.
[03:56:22.908 --> 03:56:23.428]  Just look at him.
[03:56:23.588 --> 03:56:25.430]  He looks sickly and green.
[03:56:26.090 --> 03:56:27.371]  He doesn't look well.
[03:56:27.958 --> 03:56:33.904]  And all of them are like this and their health, it just appears to be plummeting during the Trump administration.
[03:56:33.964 --> 03:56:36.387]  Almost like hatred is bad for the body.
[03:56:37.248 --> 03:56:41.272]  And I do want to say this is my olive branch to Mr. Nadler.
[03:56:42.033 --> 03:56:43.054]  This is the olive branch.
[03:56:43.835 --> 03:56:46.097]  I invite him and Nancy Pelosi.
[03:56:46.727 --> 03:56:48.868]  To go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:56:49.308 --> 03:56:53.070]  Because there are tremendous deals happening right now with the Memorial Day Sale.
[03:56:53.610 --> 03:56:58.552]  And they can stock up on some of the supplements that could perhaps give them a little bit of vitality.
[03:56:58.572 --> 03:57:01.473]  Mr. Nadler, Super Male Vitality helped me lose a lot of weight.
[03:57:02.073 --> 03:57:03.234]  Almost 100 pounds.
[03:57:03.754 --> 03:57:04.414]  Just saying.
[03:57:04.895 --> 03:57:07.016]  It may be able to do the same for you, my friend.
[03:57:07.296 --> 03:57:10.817]  And Nancy Pelosi, might I suggest TurboForce.
[03:57:11.357 --> 03:57:14.859]  It will give you the acuity, the mental fitness of perhaps
[03:57:15.760 --> 03:57:17.021]  Oh, a 60-year-old.
[03:57:17.041 --> 03:57:24.163]  I mean, you're 79, Miss Pelosi, so I understand you may never be a young person mentally ever again, but we can at least get you back into the 60s.
[03:57:24.383 --> 03:57:25.364]  Maybe, maybe, maybe.
[03:57:25.424 --> 03:57:27.085]  Just a little bit of turbo force in the morning.
[03:57:27.365 --> 03:57:30.826]  Maybe before your next press conference, pop a brain force or two.
[03:57:31.306 --> 03:57:32.727]  We'll get you back into this morning.
[03:57:32.907 --> 03:57:33.467]  We can do it.
[03:57:33.667 --> 03:57:35.869]  InfoWars has the power.
[03:57:36.709 --> 03:57:38.150]  So, I am Tom Pappard.
[03:57:38.170 --> 03:57:39.351]  Facebook's got Emperor Trump.
[03:57:39.371 --> 03:57:42.153]  It's looking like I'll be back on Monday to guest host the fourth hour.
[03:57:42.393 --> 03:57:44.554]  You can, of course, catch my show every night, 8 p.m.
[03:57:44.614 --> 03:57:45.295]  on Facebook.
[03:57:45.915 --> 03:57:48.437]  And make sure to catch War Room, coming up next.
[03:57:48.737 --> 03:57:49.478]  We'll see you next time.
[03:57:56.059 --> 03:58:11.703]  What it really is, Alex, is I'm getting sick and tired of liberals with their arguments trying to push absolute untruths and illogical conclusions and think that we're just going to have to believe them because they resort to emotional appeals to try to make everyone feel uncomfortable.
[03:58:11.963 --> 03:58:12.844]  That's what they try to do.
[03:58:13.104 --> 03:58:16.105]  Resort to emotional appeals so that people feel uncomfortable.
[03:58:16.126 --> 03:58:22.729]  They can shut down dialogue, and then we can't reach the factual, logical conclusion that they're wrong.
[03:58:22.870 --> 03:58:26.332]  You know what the best way to refute liberal arguments is?
[03:58:26.792 --> 03:58:31.315]  You just go out there, and you put a microphone in front of their face, and you let them speak.
[03:58:31.715 --> 03:58:40.320]  And ask them to essentially tell you why they support what they support, and you will just get a bunch of jibber jabber, cussing, yelling.
[03:58:40.540 --> 03:58:43.942]  You've been interviewing people six, seven years, but intensely the last four.
[03:58:44.943 --> 03:58:46.884]  Obviously, it's getting more extreme.
[03:58:46.924 --> 03:58:50.026]  How would you describe the tenor in the last few years?
[03:58:50.267 --> 03:58:59.633]  There's definitely an uptick in violence and hostility, and it's not just InfoWars, because I've seen other journalists out there, Breitbart, other media companies, get the same vitriol.
