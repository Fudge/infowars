[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.351]  Let's say I told a chicken-cross-the-road joke one time, and if the news put it on every channel in the country, you'd think that's the chicken and the road guy.
[00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:07.411]  Call it the gay frogs deal.
[00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:11.473]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:00:11.513 --> 00:00:13.093]  Do you understand that?
[00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.874]  Turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:00:15.374 --> 00:00:16.414]  It's crap!
[00:00:16.774 --> 00:00:23.337]  So, Sean used to be a looser, but he's mad that I'm a big Trump supporter, which is fine, but he's got a peace hat saying, people for peace, and Trump's the only one trying to pull us out of wars.
[00:00:23.697 --> 00:00:24.177]  Says Kennedy.
[00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:29.149]  I get that, and I'm all for peace everywhere.
[00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:40.716]  I don't like war, and I don't promote... I was a huge Rand Paul supporter, and I just kind of got turned off by his promoting of Trump.
[00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:46.239]  I know he's a Republican, I know he has to toe the party line, but I think that he's just become too much of a sucker.
[00:00:48.038 --> 00:00:49.099]  Yes, exactly.
[00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:55.843]  With the impeachment investigation, everything that's been leading up to the open hearings that are going to start on Wednesday
[00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:25.135]  Quid pro quo, unless you're personally making money, is not illegal.
[00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:31.457]  Because that's what people all the time, like Kennedy says, we'll take our missiles out of Turkey, you take your missiles out of Cuba.
[00:01:31.817 --> 00:01:34.697]  We have a treaty with Ukraine, they're supposed to go after corruption.
[00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:35.518]  Yes, correct.
[00:01:35.618 --> 00:01:37.098]  So this is all just spin.
[00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:40.380]  And, you know, and I'm all for them going after corruption.
[00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:42.422]  I have zero problem with that.
[00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:48.808]  But I do have a problem with holding up the aid for that.
[00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:51.730]  You know, for them to say... Well, that's in a treaty, though.
[00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.711]  Yes.
[00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:59.376]  No, what I'm saying is for them to hold up the funds in order for them to do the investigation into Biden and Burisma... They never held up and they got them.
[00:01:59.416 --> 00:01:59.977]  ...and Burisma.
[00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:03.160]  When you said you had a clear understanding that
[00:02:05.182 --> 00:02:12.066]  President Zelensky had to commit to an investigation of Biden's before the aid got released, and the aid got released and he didn't commit to an investigation.
[00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:16.689]  Mr. I was not wrong about what I told you, which is what I heard.
[00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.870]  That's all I've said.
[00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.231]  I've told you what I heard.
[00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:20.371]  And that's the point.
[00:02:20.912 --> 00:02:22.793]  What you heard did not happen.
[00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:24.434]  It didn't happen.
[00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:30.818]  We got six people having four conversations in one sentence, and you just told me this is where you got your clear understanding.
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.262]  Says declaration of Ambassador Gordon Sondland.
[00:02:35.282 --> 00:02:48.655]  Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yarmack on September 1st 2019 in connection with Vice President Pence's visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President Zelensky.
[00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:55.843]  We know that from your deposition in those 55 days that aid is delayed you met with President Zelensky three times.
[00:02:56.837 --> 00:03:01.359]  The first one was July 26th, the day after the famous call now between President Trump and President Zelensky.
[00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.141]  President Zelensky meets with you, Ambassador Volker and Ambassador Sondland.
[00:03:05.941 --> 00:03:13.925]  And again, according to your deposition, your testimony, there was no linkage of security assistance dollars to investigating Burisma or the Bidens.
[00:03:14.905 --> 00:03:16.326]  Second meeting is August 27th.
[00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:19.487]  Again, in this 55 day time frame, second meeting is August 27th.
[00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:22.449]  President Zelensky meets with you and Ambassador Bolton and others.
[00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.331]  And again, there's no linkage of dollars, security assistance dollars, to an investigation of the Bidens.
[00:03:30.072 --> 00:03:31.852]  Then, of course, the third meeting is September 5th.
[00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:35.694]  President Zelensky meets with you and Senators Johnson and Murphy.
[00:03:36.554 --> 00:03:42.656]  And once again, there is no linkage of security assistance dollars to an investigation of Burisma or the Bidens.
[00:03:43.457 --> 00:03:47.718]  Three meetings with the president of Ukraine, the new president, and no linkage.
[00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:48.799]  That's accurate?
[00:03:52.145 --> 00:04:08.009]  Mr. Jordan, it's certainly accurate on the first two meetings, because to my knowledge, the Ukrainians were not aware of the hold on assistance until the 29th of August.
[00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.809]  The Politico article.
[00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.350]  The Politico article.
[00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:21.453]  The third meeting that you mentioned with the Senators, Senator Murphy and Senator Johnson, there was discussion of the security assistance, but... The linkage.
[00:04:22.993 --> 00:04:25.914]  There was not, there was not discussion of linkage.
[00:04:26.254 --> 00:04:27.935]  Yeah, but they never did, they were held up and they got them.
[00:04:27.955 --> 00:04:31.536]  That's, that is what the Prime Minister is saying, the President of Ukraine is saying.
[00:04:31.596 --> 00:04:33.056]  But do you see how they changed the subject?
[00:04:33.616 --> 00:04:37.297]  What about the child kidnapping rings and the blackmail rings in Hillary?
[00:04:37.737 --> 00:04:42.159]  What about, what about Hillary and Uranium One and the Russians and China and the selling of the missiles?
[00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.739]  My God!
[00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.819]  We're talking about the President going, yeah, that corruption!
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.281]  To the other President, I mean... No, I get that, and those are, and those are two entirely different things, you know.
[00:04:51.607 --> 00:04:59.892]  The investigation into the quid pro quo is completely different than the Jeffrey Epstein situation.
[00:05:00.212 --> 00:05:02.834]  I mean, me personally, I believe that he was killed.
[00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:05.636]  I think that he was killed because he knew too much.
[00:05:05.976 --> 00:05:08.157]  He was about to expose way too many people.
[00:05:08.617 --> 00:05:09.238]  Prince Andrew.
[00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:17.769]  The problem was the fact that once he had been convicted, I stayed with him.
[00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:28.437]  And that's the bit that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis, because it was not something that was becoming a member of the royal family.
[00:05:28.597 --> 00:05:35.322]  And we try and uphold the highest standards and practices, and I let the side down.
[00:05:35.743 --> 00:05:36.143]  Simple as that.
[00:05:36.872 --> 00:05:41.815]  One of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts, has made allegations against you.
[00:05:42.635 --> 00:05:44.857]  She says she met you in 2001.
[00:05:45.417 --> 00:05:49.679]  She says she dined with you, danced with you at Tramp Nightclub in London.
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.363]  She went on to have sex with you in a house in Belgravia belonging to Gerlaine Maxwell, your friend.
[00:05:57.164 --> 00:05:57.804]  Your response?
[00:05:59.665 --> 00:06:02.527]  I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady.
[00:06:03.728 --> 00:06:04.308]  None whatsoever.
[00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:06.872]  You don't remember meeting her.
[00:06:07.392 --> 00:06:08.932]  Over in the UK, he was about to expose him.
[00:06:09.972 --> 00:06:10.932]  The royals aren't going to have that.
[00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:12.193]  I mean, look what they did to Diana.
[00:06:13.033 --> 00:06:17.214]  For me, personally, at Google, we're not involved in that.
[00:06:17.234 --> 00:06:18.454]  You know, we're not involved in it.
[00:06:18.474 --> 00:06:25.296]  Google is deplatforming everyone that there's been covering how they're using sex trafficking to control people.
[00:06:25.576 --> 00:06:26.876]  That's one of the reasons Google gave.
[00:06:28.502 --> 00:06:29.423]  Thanks for deplatforming me.
[00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:41.530]  And I really, really oppose them taking you off the air, you know, and Facebook, and everybody who was censoring you, you know, because I think that you have a right to say whatever you'd like, just as I do.
[00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.350]  Well, here's what happens.
[00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:46.333]  Once they silence you, then the people can say whatever lies they want.
[00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:50.335]  Almost everything they said I said was made up, even though I have a First Amendment right to say that before.
[00:06:50.876 --> 00:06:52.857]  Once they take you off something, they can make up whatever they want.
[00:06:54.264 --> 00:06:54.824]  No, no, I get that.
[00:06:54.864 --> 00:06:58.105]  I mean, once I got deplatformed on those things, they said that I said there's slave colonies on Mars.
[00:06:58.125 --> 00:06:58.746]  I never said that.
[00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:00.886]  They say that I get into the lizard people stuff.
[00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:01.667]  That's not me saying that.
[00:07:01.967 --> 00:07:03.087]  The people have a right to say that stuff.
[00:07:03.147 --> 00:07:03.808]  It's not true.
[00:07:04.688 --> 00:07:08.289]  But I said real stuff in federal court cases about Epstein and the Clintons.
[00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:15.352]  That's why they wanted me deplatformed, because the same reason ABC spiked the story, because there's powerful groups that don't want that information out.
[00:07:15.612 --> 00:07:25.383]  Well, I think another thing that had to do with that, you know, with you getting the platform removed from you, was... I think the biggest contributing factor was the Sandy Hook thing.
[00:07:26.204 --> 00:07:29.408]  You know, I think that that was a huge contributing factor.
[00:07:29.428 --> 00:07:30.549]  And again, they used the misrepresentation.
[00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:31.049]  We're good to go.
[00:07:52.461 --> 00:08:02.832]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[00:08:04.113 --> 00:08:15.124]  He even said, and this really just is so disgusting, he even said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors.
[00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.732]  And no one was actually killed there.
[00:08:18.852 --> 00:08:25.458]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be.
[00:08:35.492 --> 00:08:40.774]  All I can do is give you my word and tell you, if there's one thing about me, I do what I say I'm gonna do.
[00:08:40.814 --> 00:08:45.155]  And I don't double-cross, so... You know, you just became very fascinating to me.
[00:08:45.215 --> 00:08:47.276]  I just sort of thought you were this...
[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:10.365]  My goal is for your listeners and the left, you know, who will be watching some on NBC to say, wow, that was really interesting.
[00:09:10.625 --> 00:09:14.526]  And then the next time I want to get somebody, they're going to say, look what you did to Alex Jones.
[00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:16.907]  It's not going to be some gotcha hit piece.
[00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:17.887]  I promise you that.
[00:09:18.387 --> 00:09:19.448]  You see how edited it was?
[00:09:19.648 --> 00:09:20.088]  Yeah, no.
[00:09:20.128 --> 00:09:21.088]  I'm telling you, these are all edited.
[00:09:22.609 --> 00:09:23.509]  I did a whole rant about it.
[00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:35.355]  I don't know if Hillary is guilty of any child kidnapping rings at this pizza place, but I know that she funded the Arab Spring and the ISIS takeovers where hundreds of thousands died, tens of thousands of women and children in sex slavery, and I showed articles on video.
[00:09:35.795 --> 00:09:42.358]  Megyn Kelly edited audio of that before she left Fox, played it, and said I was talking about child trafficking with that to discredit it.
[00:09:42.698 --> 00:09:46.300]  Did you know, or did your producers do that to you, where I said Hillary Clinton
[00:09:47.686 --> 00:09:57.615]  Um, you know, personally, and it was tongue-in-cheek, so I can get the satire out of you guys, took it out of context, but did personally kill kids by the Iraq war, the Syria war, or the Libya situation.
[00:09:57.955 --> 00:10:00.517]  And you guys cut the, you know, like, the back off of that.
[00:10:00.537 --> 00:10:06.823]  I mean, it was in the same 30 seconds where I said I'm not talking about the pizza place, I'm talking about, uh, in the Middle East.
[00:10:07.263 --> 00:10:11.867]  The first thing we need is Gallagher in our West Coast newsroom on how this whole thing got started.
[00:10:12.088 --> 00:10:12.308]  Trace?
[00:10:14.312 --> 00:10:17.794]  Megan, as many controversies do these days, it began with a tweet.
[00:10:18.174 --> 00:10:38.927]  On October 30th, days after the FBI announced they'd be reopening an investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails, someone on Twitter, whose name remains unverified but has several thousand followers, posted that new emails found on Anthony Weiner's computer confirmed that Hillary Clinton was involved in a pedophilia ring.
[00:10:39.467 --> 00:10:45.755]  Infowars Alex Jones, a far-right web host, posted a YouTube video seen almost 500,000 times.
[00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:09.860]  The rumors spread, inspiring some newfound internet sleuths to start digging around in John Podesta's hacked emails, searching for proof and location of the so-called sex ring.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.883]  What they found were numerous references to pizza,
[00:11:16.966 --> 00:11:19.727]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:11:19.787 --> 00:11:20.767]  It's a message to Hillary.
[00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:22.847]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:11:23.827 --> 00:11:36.850]  When I think about all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped, I have zero fear standing up against her.
[00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.150]  Yeah, you heard me right.
[00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.611]  Hillary Clinton has personally murdered children.
[00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:45.532]  I just can't hold back the truth anymore.
[00:11:46.933 --> 00:11:51.476]  Hillary Clinton is one of the most vicious serial killers the planet's ever seen.
[00:11:52.077 --> 00:11:55.799]  Now there's a twist to that.
[00:11:55.819 --> 00:12:01.063]  Am I talking about the devil worship story with her chief of staff, her campaign chairman?
[00:12:01.143 --> 00:12:06.407]  Looking at the menu of blood and semen and body parts at the Alistair Crowley event?
[00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:07.427]  The private event?
[00:12:07.948 --> 00:12:09.148]  Oh no, I'm not talking about that.
[00:12:09.609 --> 00:12:13.551]  I mean 200,000 plus dead Christians with her operation with Syria.
[00:12:14.412 --> 00:12:30.645]  And our operation in Libya and not let the Christians get out and directing Al Qaeda and ISIS who target and murder children and put them through sex slavery and throw Catholic priests off cliffs and kill people in mass and murder gays and everything else you can imagine because they don't like peaceful people.
[00:12:31.726 --> 00:12:32.667]  And they con everybody.
[00:12:32.767 --> 00:12:35.469]  They're for open society and they love everybody.
[00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.891]  Anything they do is for degradation.
[00:12:38.512 --> 00:12:40.774]  That's total fake news like ABC showing.
[00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:54.472]  This video right here appearing to show Turkey's military bombing Kurd civilians in a Syrian border town.
[00:12:54.812 --> 00:12:57.113]  The Kurds who fought alongside the U.S.
[00:12:57.213 --> 00:12:58.073]  against ISIS.
[00:12:58.593 --> 00:13:03.915]  Now horrific reports of atrocities committed by Turkish back fighters on those very allies.
[00:13:04.195 --> 00:13:07.178]  Do you believe that the Sandy Hook Massacre happened?
[00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:39.137]  I was reading an article out of like Berkeley Science Journal out of the university and then I was covering Democracy Now about the male frogs being attracted to other male frogs and the numbers plummeting.
[00:13:39.497 --> 00:13:42.017]  Here at Berkeley I was a new assistant professor.
[00:13:42.477 --> 00:13:57.140]  I was already studying the effects of hormones and the effects of chemicals that interfere with hormones on amphibian development and I was approached by the manufacturer and asked to study the effects of atrazine, the herbicide, on frogs and after I discovered that it
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.581]  interfered with male development and caused males to turn into females to develop eggs.
[00:14:03.061 --> 00:14:09.942]  The company tried to prevent me from publishing and from discussing that work with other scientists outside of their panel.
[00:14:10.483 --> 00:14:23.025]  And eventually they moved to asking me to manipulate data or to misrepresent data and ultimately they told me I could not publish or could not talk about the data outside of their closed panel.
[00:14:23.567 --> 00:14:26.330]  And I said, I don't want to put chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay.
[00:14:26.871 --> 00:14:28.773]  That becomes who I am, out of context.
[00:14:29.174 --> 00:14:30.756]  When the actor's in it, all that's 100% real.
[00:14:31.276 --> 00:14:33.239]  And that becomes my identity, just like the Sandy Hook.
[00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:35.261]  I like the gay frog thing better than Sandy Hook.
[00:14:35.482 --> 00:14:36.683]  Because it's not my identity.
[00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:40.147]  And these families go on the news, they go, he's sitting in our house last week.
[00:14:40.788 --> 00:14:41.789]  We just hope he stops.
[00:14:41.849 --> 00:14:42.249]  It's rough.
[00:14:42.309 --> 00:14:44.011]  It's like five years that we're talking about it.
[00:14:44.311 --> 00:14:46.252]  And it's like, it's not true.
[00:14:46.793 --> 00:14:50.836]  And so, you know, it's just, it's all about a bunch of fundraising and all the rest of it.
[00:14:51.136 --> 00:14:53.758]  The families are in lawsuits with each other, fighting over the money and all that.
[00:14:54.018 --> 00:14:55.079]  They sued the dead teacher.
[00:14:55.319 --> 00:14:56.160]  They sued the school.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.321]  They sued Remington.
[00:14:57.621 --> 00:14:58.722]  And their suits are getting thrown out.
[00:14:59.523 --> 00:15:01.805]  Well, I'm glad that I got to hear you say that.
[00:15:01.885 --> 00:15:03.866]  Sure, I said it on Joe Rogan.
[00:15:04.146 --> 00:15:05.307]  That's what I've seen 30 million times.
[00:15:05.327 --> 00:15:05.988]  People still say it.
[00:15:06.008 --> 00:15:06.808]  I've never heard you say it.
[00:15:07.569 --> 00:15:09.950]  Well, you know, for me personally, I'm glad.
[00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:14.131]  And you know, I respect your First Amendment right to be out here and protesting.
[00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:17.831]  And you know, like I said, I used to watch your show for a long time.
[00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:19.872]  And I still respect you.
[00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:22.332]  Tune back in to InfoWars.com or Band.Video.
[00:15:22.352 --> 00:15:24.873]  You're going to find it right on the platform and see what I'm actually saying.
[00:15:25.153 --> 00:15:25.893]  And call in sometime.
[00:15:25.913 --> 00:15:26.093]  All right.
[00:15:26.113 --> 00:15:26.973]  And we're going to put this out, man.
[00:15:26.993 --> 00:15:27.213]  All right.
[00:15:27.253 --> 00:15:27.414]  Thanks.
[00:15:27.454 --> 00:15:27.614]  Thanks.
[00:15:27.634 --> 00:15:27.954]  Appreciate it.
[00:15:27.974 --> 00:15:29.014]  Anybody else want to jump in here real quick?
[00:15:29.854 --> 00:15:31.735]  Pardon me?
[00:15:32.455 --> 00:15:36.117]  Did you know the media misrepresents what I actually say?
[00:15:36.357 --> 00:15:37.977]  Like, give me an example of one of my conspiracies.
[00:15:44.761 --> 00:15:52.763]  It might look like we're out in a bush somewhere, but 15 feet on either side, we're surrounded by agriculture, and the runoff ends up in this river.
[00:15:53.563 --> 00:15:58.585]  All of the algae is the result of all the nutrients, because a lot of fertilizers are used in agriculture.
[00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:02.526]  And once those fertilizers get into the water, you get these blooms of algae.
[00:16:03.306 --> 00:16:09.068]  Our data so far suggests that the mixture of pesticides causes an increase in stress hormones.
[00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:15.831]  And those stress hormones cause immunosuppression, which leads to the inability to respond to any kind of disease pathogen.
[00:16:16.771 --> 00:16:20.513]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:16:21.253 --> 00:16:25.795]  It seems that even the tough bullfrog isn't doing so well with the toxins in this water.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.901]  I got a chair going.
[00:16:32.921 --> 00:16:34.842]  I got a chair going.
[00:16:35.242 --> 00:16:36.143]  What about gay frogs?
[00:16:36.403 --> 00:16:37.124]  It's not funny!
[00:16:37.184 --> 00:16:40.005]  I'm gonna say it real slow for you.
[00:16:40.025 --> 00:16:40.886]  GAY FROGS!
[00:16:41.326 --> 00:16:45.469]  Hayes is testing the effects of chemicals like atrazine, a common herbicide.
[00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.773]  We have a whole family of animals where we've eliminated the female chromosome.
[00:16:51.113 --> 00:16:52.354]  Specimen zero one.
[00:16:53.612 --> 00:16:57.835]  These animals that we know are genetic males have been exposed to atrazine for their entire life.
[00:16:58.516 --> 00:17:02.459]  And many of these genetic males now are turning into females.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.083]  And quite frankly, if you're a genetic male, it'd be nice if you developed as a genetic male.
[00:17:08.103 --> 00:17:12.627]  And now we have a chemical very common in the environment that's effectively sex-reversing animals.
[00:17:13.147 --> 00:17:17.090]  Now obviously it's not fair to judge a guy on one isolated dumbass clip.
[00:17:17.751 --> 00:17:18.752]  So here's a bunch of them.
[00:17:19.472 --> 00:17:20.933]  Alex is anti-gay.
[00:17:20.953 --> 00:17:23.615]  He's saying the chemicals are making people gay.
[00:17:24.075 --> 00:17:26.117]  Folks, it's making the frogs gay.
[00:17:26.417 --> 00:17:29.719]  Two-thirds of the frogs down in Houston are bisexual.
[00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:31.600]  Do you understand that?
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.342]  Turn the freaking frogs gay!
[00:17:33.422 --> 00:17:33.722]  Boom!
[00:17:33.822 --> 00:17:34.102]  Boom!
[00:17:34.142 --> 00:17:34.923]  Serious crap!
[00:17:42.288 --> 00:17:44.009]  The one that's sort of remarkable is this pair.
[00:17:46.226 --> 00:17:47.027]  These are both males.
[00:17:47.588 --> 00:17:52.133]  The one on the bottom, acting as the female, we affectionately refer to as Darnell.
[00:17:52.834 --> 00:17:57.740]  He's a genetic male that not only acts like a female, he lays eggs like a female.
[00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:01.084]  He, she has been exposed to atrazine.
[00:18:02.501 --> 00:18:05.222]  All of her, his, her life and I don't even really know how to reference it.
[00:18:05.582 --> 00:18:07.103]  This is Darnell's third clutch.
[00:18:07.663 --> 00:18:10.304]  So Darnell has sons and daughters that we've grown up.
[00:18:11.025 --> 00:18:12.405]  You can see eggs in the bottom.
[00:18:13.025 --> 00:18:14.726]  This is actually her second clutch for today.
[00:18:15.286 --> 00:18:18.588]  He, she has been copulating for getting close to 24 hours now.
[00:18:20.379 --> 00:18:23.981]  This is probably one of the most remarkable things I've seen in my work.
[00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:34.626]  Jones has argued that the government has the ability to control tornadoes, and that tap water is a gay bomb, and that they are putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay.
[00:18:35.366 --> 00:18:36.847]  I'm gonna say it real slow for you.
[00:18:37.727 --> 00:18:38.087]  FROGS!
[00:18:40.695 --> 00:18:41.696]  I am worried.
[00:18:41.756 --> 00:18:45.378]  This is the most common contaminant in ground and surface water and drinking water.
[00:18:45.818 --> 00:18:53.182]  And the level of atrocine that it took to make this male turn into a female is three times less than what's allowed in our drinking water.
[00:18:53.202 --> 00:18:54.543]  You know what?
[00:18:55.123 --> 00:18:58.285]  I guess it makes sense that Donald Trump wants to impress Alex Jones.
[00:18:58.565 --> 00:19:02.287]  Why would you want to drain the swamp if not to eradicate all those gay frogs?
[00:19:03.287 --> 00:19:04.128]  You stay there.
[00:19:04.288 --> 00:19:05.629]  You two stay where you are.
[00:19:06.509 --> 00:19:08.771]  It's not just a problem with frogs we should be concerned about.
[00:19:09.251 --> 00:19:13.574]  The water that's causing their problems is the same water that we're drinking and using to water our crops.
[00:19:16.476 --> 00:19:18.057]  Do you understand that?
[00:19:18.097 --> 00:19:19.799]  Turn the freaking frogs gay!
[00:19:19.839 --> 00:19:20.199]  Boo!
[00:19:20.219 --> 00:19:20.559]  Boo!
[00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:21.400]  Serious crap!
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:21.860]  Gay!
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.220]  Frogs!
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.061]  Freaking frogs!
[00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:23.521]  Boo!
[00:19:23.581 --> 00:19:24.242]  It's not funny!
[00:19:24.322 --> 00:19:26.303]  I'm gonna say it real slow for you.
[00:19:29.427 --> 00:19:32.749]  Infowars.com!
[00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:38.692]  Infowars life has done it again with undoubtedly our biggest breakthrough yet.

[00:19:52.699 --> 00:19:53.560]  It's called whitening
