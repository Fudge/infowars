[00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:12.397]  George Soros is banned in his home country of Hungary, the Philippines, Turkey, Russia, Poland, and Pakistan, but his presence in the United States, and more importantly, its elections, couldn't be stronger.
[00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:29.507]  During the 2016 presidential elections, we discovered that Lord Mark Malik Brown, chairman of the company Smartmatics, which caused voting machine chaos in countries all over the world, served on Soros' Open Society Foundation's global board.
[00:00:29.747 --> 00:00:54.442]  Not satisfied with simply rigging the voting machines, Soros is renting Christian evangelicals, as the Washington Times reported, and the National Review reported all the way back in 2010 that the progressive evangelical organization Sojourners, headed by Jim Wallace, had received grants from the Open Society Institute, the foundation of left-wing billionaire George Soros.
[00:00:54.742 --> 00:01:03.566]  Is it any wonder that Christianity Today, which wrote a glowing article of Soros' immigration strategy, savagely attacked President Trump?
[00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:13.349]  The question is, when does his behavior, which is described as immoral, accurately rise to the level where he's no longer fit to serve office?
[00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:17.491]  And to me, we crossed that line with the impeachment hearings.
[00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:28.894]  So it's better late than never that Attorney General Barr is commenting on the damage to our criminal justice system that Soros-backed district attorneys are waging across the United States.
[00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:34.635]  You talked in your piece about social justice DAs, and you put social justice in quotes.
[00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:36.675]  What do you mean by that?
[00:01:36.976 --> 00:01:38.596]  What does that mean, social justice DAs?
[00:01:39.156 --> 00:02:05.601]  Well, there's been this recent development where George Soros has been coming in largely in Democratic primaries where there's not going to be much voter turnout and putting in a lot of money to elect people who are not very supportive of law enforcement and don't view the office as bringing to trial and prosecuting criminals.
[00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:16.068]  Pursuing other social agendas, and they have started to win in a number of cities, and they have, in my view, not given the proper support to the police.
[00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.874]  And they're following policies that are ultimately going to lead to an increase in violent crime and more victims.
[00:02:25.254 --> 00:02:35.165]  The pushback on Rudy Giuliani's investigation into Soros and the Obama administration's back ties in the Ukraine has been branded a bumbling scavenger hunt.
[00:02:35.325 --> 00:02:46.398]  But as The Hill previously reported, it turns out that the group that Ukrainian law enforcement was probing was co-founded by the Obama administration and liberal mega-donor George Soros.
[00:02:46.578 --> 00:02:46.798]  I think?
[00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.570]  We're good.
[00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:26.467]  I don't know.
[00:03:47.113 --> 00:03:53.116]  We'll continue to deflect all of the blame on a duly elected president that did nothing wrong.
[00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:54.497]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:03:54.797 --> 00:04:06.484]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, December 23rd, 2019 transmission.
[00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:13.568]  You know, one of my greatest frustrations is one of my greatest joys.
[00:04:15.003 --> 00:04:24.786]  It's that my crew, our reporters, our researchers, just churn out five-star research and information like that John Bowne report.
[00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.807]  That is so incredibly important.
[00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:28.927]  Shadowband everywhere.
[00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:33.569]  The only place you're going to find it is at band.video, and if you get excited and share it, millions will see it.
[00:04:33.609 --> 00:04:34.729]  If not, the enemy will win.
[00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:36.210]  We'll be right back with the full launch.
[00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.352]  I made a promise to you on air, and I intend to keep it.
[00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:51.575]  I made a promise to my family, and my friends, and my neighbors, and my community, and I intend to keep it.
[00:04:52.655 --> 00:04:57.137]  I made a promise to myself, and I intend to keep it.
[00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:02.939]  But I'll tell you who I really made a promise to a long time ago, and that was God.
[00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:12.723]  I've experienced God's presence, and I keep my personal experiences to myself.
[00:05:14.096 --> 00:05:14.776]  At least for now.
[00:05:17.477 --> 00:05:23.119]  But I take that pledge to God very, very serious.
[00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:33.682]  But it's in pledging yourself to a worthy cause that God is able to enter your life.
[00:05:34.362 --> 00:05:37.983]  Because God isn't a rapist like the devil.
[00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:51.085]  And the Bible and Christ talks about we are the bride and God is the groom.
[00:05:54.928 --> 00:06:04.976]  And to say that it's physically sexual is not correct, but it is spiritual union with God and a marriage.
[00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:19.463]  Just as Adam created Eve, God created us so that God would not be lonely in the universe.
[00:06:21.184 --> 00:06:24.125]  It's all hidden right there on the face of it.
[00:06:24.705 --> 00:06:26.565]  But the profane cannot understand it.
[00:06:33.568 --> 00:06:38.469]  And they work around the clock trying to keep you from learning those secrets.
[00:06:43.991 --> 00:06:45.392]  I'm really proud of this whole crew.
[00:06:48.073 --> 00:06:49.994]  They're present, they're conscious, they're focused.
[00:06:51.375 --> 00:07:06.403]  But my greatest frustration is that we have so much incredible information, and then we get it out, but then if we don't promote it, and if we don't point out how important it is, you don't promote it and point out how important it is, and it dies on the vine.
[00:07:07.404 --> 00:07:09.185]  Because as much as I love our core audience,
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.082]  You're the jump point to everybody else to win this fight.
[00:07:15.222 --> 00:07:17.163]  You're the gun with the bullets loaded in it.
[00:07:18.924 --> 00:07:20.524]  InfoWars is the ammunition.
[00:07:20.805 --> 00:07:21.745]  You are the gun.
[00:07:22.285 --> 00:07:23.426]  You are the artillery.
[00:07:24.686 --> 00:07:25.727]  You're the missile launcher.
[00:07:26.007 --> 00:07:27.007]  You're the particle beam.
[00:07:27.628 --> 00:07:28.448]  You're the bomber.
[00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:37.072]  You fire the weapon, the truth.
[00:07:38.985 --> 00:07:40.985]  That's why I'm always trying to explain, hey, you're really critical.
[00:07:41.325 --> 00:07:43.566]  Hey, you're as important as I am or more.
[00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:45.966]  That's not to make you feel important.
[00:07:45.986 --> 00:07:47.266]  It's because you are important.
[00:07:50.947 --> 00:07:53.808]  And so I see these reports like the one John Bowne just put out.
[00:07:54.888 --> 00:07:57.468]  That's only on Banned.Video in the John Bowne section.
[00:07:57.908 --> 00:07:59.049]  It needs to be shared everywhere.
[00:08:00.829 --> 00:08:02.429]  Banned Soros from the USA.
[00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.990]  By the way, he's banned in a whole bunch of countries.
[00:08:11.414 --> 00:08:12.195]  Look at those reports.
[00:08:12.275 --> 00:08:13.936]  Those need to get out to everybody.
[00:08:18.119 --> 00:08:23.202]  Those are bullets, politically, spiritually, that need to be fired at the enemy.
[00:08:25.244 --> 00:08:28.066]  And you do that by getting them out to people that don't know what's going on.
[00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:42.319]  When Fox News even tries to have Judicial Watch on, Lou Dobbs, they go, hey, he still has these people in the State Department, here's their names, and they're still getting $5 billion a year on average to fund international operations and then to work against America's interests.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:52.624]  Fox News threatened to fire Dobbs, they threatened to cancel his show, they said we'll never have Judicial Watch's head on again.
[00:08:53.284 --> 00:08:55.585]  Because what he said was true, it's what we were saying.
[00:08:58.174 --> 00:09:00.696]  So if you ever say the truth, it's game over.
[00:09:03.277 --> 00:09:23.831]  That's why when the Attorney General came out on Fox News three days ago, they did an interview a week ago, but they've been doling out the clips, when they released the second tranche of the interview this weekend, last weekend,
[00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:38.258]  He said Soros is basically putting district attorneys in so they can have organized crime takeover, which is true, which is outrageous, which is sensational.
[00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:41.541]  So it's those great truths that aren't supposed to be said.
[00:09:42.302 --> 00:09:47.547]  They're trying to shut us down, namely for exposing Soros, and now the Attorney General's doing it.
[00:09:48.516 --> 00:09:50.637]  You don't just think he's saying that for no reason.
[00:09:50.697 --> 00:09:52.138]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:59.182]  Just like when he called Comey a liar last week and said Comey ran the illegal investigations and perjured himself to Congress.
[00:09:59.662 --> 00:10:00.863]  We all know that.
[00:10:03.004 --> 00:10:08.327]  But to have the Attorney General say it lets you know they are preparing to take action.
[00:10:08.767 --> 00:10:13.189]  He also said last week that they're preparing criminal action against Big Tech.
[00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:15.491]  That they may not go with the antitrust.
[00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:17.732]  And of course they know the crimes they've been committing.
[00:10:20.012 --> 00:10:21.453]  Stealing advertising money.
[00:10:21.553 --> 00:10:22.934]  Spying on people illegally.
[00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:25.815]  Inflating numbers.
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.981]  So, the fight's on.
[00:10:38.043 --> 00:10:38.203]  Now...
[00:10:40.031 --> 00:10:41.633]  My frustration is we get behind.
[00:10:41.713 --> 00:10:48.999]  We have a piece about homeless being confirmed to be microchipped that we've just been so busy adding some things to and some research we haven't aired.
[00:10:49.059 --> 00:10:50.080]  Should have been out two weeks ago.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:50.901]  Nobody's fault.
[00:10:54.865 --> 00:10:56.466]  Lost another pin somehow.
[00:10:56.486 --> 00:10:58.168]  It keeps happening on my hand.
[00:11:02.772 --> 00:11:04.954]  So we have all those big developments unfolding.
[00:11:09.704 --> 00:11:23.370]  We are going to release either late tonight, because I'm not going to sit on this, or tomorrow morning, the next big information deluge on Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:11:25.311 --> 00:11:37.837]  And just as we've been trailblazers on that from the beginning, we are going to trailblaze the new big path into the ongoing media cover-up, the same organizations and groups engage in the same type of procurement,
[00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:46.080]  And just exactly what Epstein really was doing, and what he's a window into.
[00:11:47.261 --> 00:12:02.328]  I'm going to tape this special report this afternoon, and then if it's ready tonight, I'm gonna stay up here late tonight, with the individual I'm putting it together with, Rob Dew, and the whistleblower.
[00:12:06.957 --> 00:12:10.438]  And then we're either going to release it tonight or early tomorrow morning.
[00:12:12.479 --> 00:12:21.783]  Then we've shot, over three days, a big vaccine danger special that just shows the admissions, the total proof, what everybody needs to see.
[00:12:23.384 --> 00:12:28.346]  That's going to be posted to InfoWars.com and Band.Video on Christmas morning.
[00:12:28.846 --> 00:12:31.307]  And I hope everybody on Christmas morning
[00:12:32.944 --> 00:12:35.286]  We'll go to Bandot video, it'll be right there as a featured video.
[00:12:35.906 --> 00:12:40.169]  And I hope you'll share that with everyone you know, because it's what they don't want you to know.
[00:12:40.349 --> 00:12:47.354]  Cut and dry, total proof that the vaccines are being spiked by design, on purpose, as population control.
[00:12:48.394 --> 00:12:49.655]  That is coming up.
[00:12:50.276 --> 00:12:54.198]  So today we just posted part one of the Clinton body count film.
[00:12:55.299 --> 00:12:59.322]  I had one of my best researchers spend a month of his time, we don't have an extra crew,
[00:13:00.862 --> 00:13:02.663]  Greg Reese to put this out.
[00:13:02.843 --> 00:13:03.763]  Very well produced.
[00:13:03.983 --> 00:13:04.844]  Very powerful.
[00:13:05.224 --> 00:13:06.825]  Ties into the whole deep state today.
[00:13:07.225 --> 00:13:07.885]  Part 1.
[00:13:08.506 --> 00:13:09.446]  That's out today.
[00:13:09.646 --> 00:13:12.307]  I'm going to air it for TV and radio stations today.
[00:13:12.367 --> 00:13:13.088]  Commercial free.
[00:13:13.668 --> 00:13:14.308]  6pm Central.
[00:13:14.348 --> 00:13:17.390]  And I'll be here introducing it and then commenting afterwards.
[00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.511]  In between shooting the big report on Epstein.
[00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:22.572]  Then I'm going to do that at 6pm tonight.
[00:13:23.693 --> 00:13:25.334]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:13:25.654 --> 00:13:29.656]  It just went up late last night.
[00:13:30.515 --> 00:13:31.256]  It needs to be shared.
[00:13:31.276 --> 00:13:32.937]  It's on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:13:33.258 --> 00:13:33.998]  Must watch film.
[00:13:34.078 --> 00:13:35.339]  New look at the Clinton body count.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.140]  Part one.
[00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:44.968]  So I committed to you to work even harder in the waning hours of 2019 and 2020, and we're doing it.
[00:13:47.622 --> 00:13:57.368]  But you have to understand, you are not the other half of the equation, you are 99.999999999999% of it.
[00:13:58.769 --> 00:14:04.853]  Just like when a sperm and egg come together, it's the womb and the placenta that are 99.9% of it.
[00:14:05.833 --> 00:14:11.757]  I'm interviewing Dr. Steve Pichinik, who really was a spy chief, really did overthrow governments on record.
[00:14:11.777 --> 00:14:14.959]  The character Jack Ryan's based on.
[00:14:16.752 --> 00:14:17.792]  For 18 years.
[00:14:19.593 --> 00:14:19.753]  Since 2002.
[00:14:20.093 --> 00:14:20.953]  Since early 2002.
[00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:24.814]  February 2002 is the first time I've ever interviewed him.
[00:14:25.474 --> 00:14:28.615]  He's going to be on with us for an hour and a half, starting at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:14:29.515 --> 00:14:30.595]  To cover the waterfront.
[00:14:30.615 --> 00:14:34.676]  A lot of stuff he just wants to get out there before this year ends.
[00:14:36.956 --> 00:14:40.017]  And he's ready to release a lot of information.
[00:14:43.098 --> 00:14:43.958]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.931]  But he is a patriot, he does care about the country, and he has a wide spectrum understanding of what's going on.
[00:14:51.731 --> 00:14:53.732]  So just a lot coming out today.
[00:14:55.732 --> 00:15:01.534]  Now, I'm gonna take off a few days, but we have some really powerful rebroadcasts lined up for you.
[00:15:02.434 --> 00:15:07.115]  I'm gonna be spending some time with the family, but other time getting other projects done and completed.
[00:15:08.896 --> 00:15:11.296]  And I'll be back Friday live.
[00:15:13.337 --> 00:15:13.977]  We're live right now.
[00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:16.830]  And there'll be other reports coming out as well.
[00:15:18.011 --> 00:15:21.073]  And if big events take place, you can just go to InfoWars, I'll be live.
[00:15:21.794 --> 00:15:22.375]  One way or another.
[00:15:27.079 --> 00:15:29.060]  Because we're living in a quickening right now.
[00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:39.450]  Now, I want to cover some of the contemporaneous news when we come back, but I just want to finish up here.
[00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:45.787]  Speaking to something.
[00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:54.817]  The establishment knows they can't hide the evil things they're into and that they do.
[00:15:57.279 --> 00:16:04.006]  And so they want to normalize all of it and that's what you see desperately going on with infanticide and
[00:16:07.213 --> 00:16:17.056]  Pedophilia and Satanism being mainlined is because they know there's a big pushback against them and they're just trying to condition us to accept it.
[00:16:18.196 --> 00:16:26.799]  That's why it's critical that this broadcast particularly never act as a desensitizer.
[00:16:28.302 --> 00:16:35.964]  They miscalculated many years ago, and I've confirmed this, and they've admitted it, because they believe my broadcast was acting as a desensitizer.
[00:16:36.904 --> 00:16:44.526]  And they believe that I would scare people by telling them the truth, but at a limited scale.
[00:16:44.606 --> 00:16:49.687]  Not that I was limiting the truth, but that it wasn't getting out on what they saw as a credible national scale.
[00:16:50.988 --> 00:16:55.769]  So they believe it would psychologically inoculate people to not think it was a big deal when it officially came out.
[00:16:57.131 --> 00:17:03.355]  And they thought I would scare people that were in the know, who weren't part of it, to then not oppose it.
[00:17:03.975 --> 00:17:05.716]  Well, I believe people had courage.
[00:17:06.616 --> 00:17:08.157]  I believe people cared about their children.
[00:17:08.918 --> 00:17:12.039]  I believe people were just distracted and busy and asleep.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:18.903]  And that if you were told the truth, you were going to be just like me and get pissed off and angry and want to do something about it.
[00:17:20.244 --> 00:17:25.107]  And of course, I bet on your red blood, and I bet right, didn't I?
[00:17:26.803 --> 00:17:32.067]  You know, it was 3% started and saw through the Revolutionary War against an empire never been defeated.
[00:17:33.368 --> 00:17:41.235]  Ladies and gentlemen, we probably got 30% of the public hardcore aware now and know how the system works.
[00:17:43.777 --> 00:17:47.500]  It was probably 10% five years ago.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.624]  When you got 30% aware of what's going on,
[00:17:54.534 --> 00:18:02.237]  If they decide to move and take action, economically, militarily, spiritually, it's over.
[00:18:03.778 --> 00:18:05.099]  So I'm gonna explain something here.
[00:18:05.739 --> 00:18:09.481]  This isn't an overly positive statement, it's the truth.
[00:18:10.061 --> 00:18:11.142]  We have won.
[00:18:12.882 --> 00:18:18.625]  And we won back at Calvary with Jesus Christ, when God took on our sins as a sacrifice.
[00:18:22.594 --> 00:18:24.555]  And gave us an example to live by.
[00:18:24.915 --> 00:18:31.918]  But, we've really won now, and the globalists know that, they just want to take as many innocent people with them as they can.
[00:18:31.938 --> 00:18:33.838]  As many souls.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:45.163]  Unless, we just get normalized that okay, all this devil worship and evil stuff's going on, Satanism,
[00:18:47.694 --> 00:18:49.415]  And then we don't do anything about it.
[00:18:49.835 --> 00:18:55.699]  If it just comes out in the open and then nothing happens to them, well then they could grab victory from the jaws of defeat.
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:03.545]  And that's why they're putting satanic altars at major capitals.
[00:19:05.906 --> 00:19:08.388]  That's why they're teaching all the occultism in schools.
[00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:10.669]  Saying you can't hand out Christmas cards.
[00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:15.573]  That's why they're saying mothers and fathers are a bad word.
[00:19:16.596 --> 00:19:19.938]  That's why the ACLU is pushing for tampon machines in all men's bathrooms.
[00:19:20.458 --> 00:19:22.600]  It's an overthrow of common sense and reality.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.801]  And that's why I'm not going to do it again today.
[00:19:24.821 --> 00:19:25.542]  I did it yesterday.
[00:19:25.562 --> 00:19:37.369]  I'm not going to air five-minute compilations of mainstream TV saying, kill babies, it's fun, it's empowering for women, it'll make you God.
[00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:39.311]  We do it for Satan.
[00:19:39.611 --> 00:19:41.132]  They're not doing that to just shock us.
[00:19:41.152 --> 00:19:44.294]  They're doing that to overwhelm us because they know that's coming out.
[00:19:48.456 --> 00:19:56.177]  But I can show you all the feminist magazines and the universities saying it's sexually pleasurable to kill your child, which of course it's not.
[00:19:57.018 --> 00:19:58.078]  Increases cancer risk.
[00:19:58.858 --> 00:19:59.478]  It's fun.
[00:19:59.898 --> 00:20:00.798]  It makes you God.
[00:20:00.818 --> 00:20:07.500]  I could sit there and put this up on screen.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:14.521]  The so-called tranny that simulates murdering babies and is a witch in a Satanism coven.
[00:20:16.547 --> 00:20:19.988]  And then this gets promoted by the left and funded by city programs in New York.
[00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:27.329]  This is cancer.
[00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:29.890]  And it wants to normalize itself to you.
[00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:42.393]  But here is Michelle Wolf in her latest event, on stage in front of a couple thousand people, cheering, talking about a mother killing her baby.
[00:20:43.999 --> 00:20:46.000]  So that she has power and plays God.
[00:20:46.481 --> 00:20:49.803]  There's never been a more satanically pure statement made.
[00:20:50.163 --> 00:20:53.865]  This is the definition of satanism.
[00:20:53.925 --> 00:20:54.345]  Here it is.
[00:20:54.986 --> 00:21:00.769]  You know, we talk about it so negatively that you feel like you should have this sense of shame after you get an abortion.
[00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.771]  Well, you can feel any way you want after you get an abortion.
[00:21:04.251 --> 00:21:04.692]  Get one!
[00:21:05.532 --> 00:21:06.373]  See how you feel!
[00:21:06.393 --> 00:21:10.776]  You know how my abortion made me feel?
[00:21:11.616 --> 00:21:12.457]  Very powerful.
[00:21:13.393 --> 00:21:15.034]  You know how people say you can't play God?
[00:21:16.674 --> 00:21:27.957]  I walked out of there being like, move over Morgan Freeman, I am God!
[00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:29.718]  Don't knock it till you try it.
[00:21:29.778 --> 00:21:32.839]  And when you do try it, really knock it.
[00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:35.400]  You know, you gotta get that baby out of there.
[00:21:39.261 --> 00:21:42.022]  Normalizing that a mother's power
[00:21:43.371 --> 00:21:58.960]  Is killing her baby for her own satanic selfishness, and enjoying it, and cheering it, and then having men pose as women and take over the powerful role, the magic role, of the woman, and then saying, in that role, I kill babies.
[00:22:00.421 --> 00:22:01.141]  This is their religion.
[00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:04.984]  This is what goes on in these cults of selfishness.
[00:22:06.324 --> 00:22:10.687]  Imagine how selfish you gotta be to torture a baby to death, to rape it, to drink its blood.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.101]  And boy, you feel powerful, they say, after you do it.
[00:22:16.161 --> 00:22:18.422]  No, you feel damned and cut off from God.
[00:22:20.162 --> 00:22:25.664]  And that's why these enemies want to shut us down so that when they try to normalize all this, we can't call out the elephant in the room.
[00:22:26.124 --> 00:22:27.765]  But because of you, we're still on air.
[00:22:27.925 --> 00:22:30.405]  Remember, it's all because of you.
[00:22:34.087 --> 00:22:41.249]  I once had an off-record discussion with the head
[00:22:42.594 --> 00:22:45.415]  of one of the four largest banks in the United States.
[00:22:47.155 --> 00:22:48.896]  And I'm not going to tell the whole story again.
[00:22:48.936 --> 00:22:49.916]  I've told it many times.
[00:22:51.436 --> 00:22:57.238]  But that was probably wasn't probably that was about 14 years ago.
[00:23:01.099 --> 00:23:03.100]  And what they told me I already knew.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:08.621]  But I didn't understand that it was the foundation of everything they've launched against us.
[00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:11.722]  And it's what I was just covering.
[00:23:14.448 --> 00:23:15.128]  Last segment.
[00:23:16.609 --> 00:23:19.391]  Now they're going, yeah, we kill babies because we enjoy it.
[00:23:19.991 --> 00:23:20.752]  And they are humans.
[00:23:20.892 --> 00:23:27.236]  And we love snuffing out their whole future and stealing the essence of their life force.
[00:23:32.779 --> 00:23:35.641]  And they have top environmentalists go, yeah, we love nuclear reactors.
[00:23:35.661 --> 00:23:36.161]  They're leaking.
[00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:37.062]  They're going to kill the earth.
[00:23:38.003 --> 00:23:39.243]  We want to kill the earth for the earth.
[00:23:40.424 --> 00:23:41.805]  And the post-human world is here.
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:44.601]  And all the rest of it.
[00:23:47.383 --> 00:23:55.668]  Because these are desperate people that have sold out to evil, and they are trying to get us to go with them because misery loves company.
[00:23:55.688 --> 00:23:58.550]  We already know the reason for all of this.
[00:24:01.272 --> 00:24:10.459]  All over the world, civilizations are discovered that had plenty of water and plenty of food when they collapsed, and there's not even signs of disease, but they're all gone.
[00:24:12.398 --> 00:24:13.459]  And you know what they always find?
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:24.467]  Giant masses of skeletons that have been eaten.
[00:24:27.109 --> 00:24:32.713]  Just a few months ago, archaeologists in Germany found a town in Germany that's about 8,000 years old.
[00:24:32.733 --> 00:24:39.679]  And they found tens of thousands of skeletons
[00:24:40.711 --> 00:24:55.786]  That had been butchered and eaten, and the scientists studied it and found out they were people from all over Europe, some of them over 2,000 miles away, that had been taken there to be eaten.
[00:24:56.847 --> 00:24:58.108]  I meant to cover that story on air.
[00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:00.190]  You can just type it in.
[00:25:01.372 --> 00:25:04.114]  Stone Age town found.
[00:25:05.498 --> 00:25:08.019]  In Germany, it was based on cannibalism.
[00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:09.180]  You're like, why would they do that?
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:17.984]  And why were people getting hauled there from a thousand miles away or more?
[00:25:20.925 --> 00:25:21.885]  Before recorded history?
[00:25:24.066 --> 00:25:25.387]  Well, it's as in the days of Noah.
[00:25:25.807 --> 00:25:27.848]  So shall it be in the days of the Antichrist.
[00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.711]  I mean, you don't think Robert E. Howard living in Texas
[00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:48.779]  Just wrote all those Conan books where Thulsa Dooms riding around kidnapping barbarian kids to take them to a faraway kingdom to be gladiators.
[00:25:52.982 --> 00:25:56.606]  Before recorded history and then they actually find villages the exact same thing.
[00:25:57.206 --> 00:25:58.427]  Well, that guy was a Mason.
[00:25:58.727 --> 00:26:01.390]  He'd be that they have the secret knowledge handed down.
[00:26:04.949 --> 00:26:06.130]  He wasn't just any mason.
[00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:10.133]  Before he committed suicide, he was basically the heavyweight champion of the world.
[00:26:10.753 --> 00:26:11.154]  Boxer.
[00:26:11.814 --> 00:26:13.535]  The Conan the Barbarian character was him.
[00:26:13.555 --> 00:26:26.925]  And then they go find villages, basically find the same thing.
[00:26:27.986 --> 00:26:29.027]  How'd he put that in a book?
[00:26:30.248 --> 00:26:31.469]  How'd he know about stuff like that?
[00:26:33.137 --> 00:26:36.539]  Because the establishment knows all of this and knows the real history.
[00:26:36.919 --> 00:26:37.700]  And we don't.
[00:26:44.043 --> 00:26:50.507]  And the sooner we start figuring out how things really work and the real history of this planet, the sooner we can get about having a future together.
[00:26:51.088 --> 00:26:59.893]  But if we don't admit who these globalists are, and what they're doing, and who they're working with that's anti-human, we don't have a chance in hell.
[00:27:05.111 --> 00:27:07.012]  By the way, I'm not attacking masons in general.
[00:27:07.052 --> 00:27:08.272]  George Washington was a mason.
[00:27:09.153 --> 00:27:11.654]  And he wrote about the Illuminati taking over masonry.
[00:27:11.894 --> 00:27:15.536]  And devil worship taking it over in letters that are in the National Archive.
[00:27:18.837 --> 00:27:19.638]  You can pull them up and read them.
[00:27:21.739 --> 00:27:23.400]  Sounds like the Alex Jones Show when you read them.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.802]  Evil secret society organizations trying to take over Christianity.
[00:27:29.182 --> 00:27:30.303]  Trying to take over masonry.
[00:27:36.513 --> 00:27:37.775]  These groups will take anything over.
[00:27:37.835 --> 00:27:39.497]  Protestants, Catholics, Muslims.
[00:27:40.378 --> 00:27:41.380]  But it's all the same group.
[00:27:44.504 --> 00:27:49.130]  Masonry is just... old-fashioned colleges.
[00:27:50.031 --> 00:27:52.775]  They didn't just teach anybody mathematics or carpentry or...
[00:27:57.958 --> 00:28:01.739]  Astrophysics, under other names, it was done in secret societies.
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.241]  And so you have the mystery cults, the mystery schools, the mystery religions.
[00:28:05.261 --> 00:28:06.281]  That's all this is.
[00:28:08.122 --> 00:28:11.343]  And then there's the lore that goes back into those mystery schools.
[00:28:12.444 --> 00:28:15.465]  And some of the lore is true, some of the lore isn't true.
[00:28:17.045 --> 00:28:22.807]  But all the books weren't destroyed in Alexandria, at the fire at the Great Library.
[00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:26.389]  They were hauled back to places like Rome.
[00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:34.443]  You don't just think Christopher Columbus knew about the New World because he just dreamed it up in a crystal ball.
[00:28:39.007 --> 00:28:40.028]  Sir Francis Bacon.
[00:28:41.009 --> 00:28:41.949]  All of them knew about it.
[00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:43.751]  They had a plan.
[00:28:46.553 --> 00:28:48.475]  They were already sending people to the New World.
[00:28:49.596 --> 00:28:54.720]  The Mayflower was a mission that came hundreds of years after missions previously.
[00:28:57.056 --> 00:28:58.177]  And the system all knows that.
[00:29:06.242 --> 00:29:07.923]  And so there's a decision we all have to make.
[00:29:07.943 --> 00:29:10.204]  Do we want a pro-human future or an anti-human future?
[00:29:10.224 --> 00:29:12.405]  Now I'm going to be a good boy when we come back.
[00:29:15.047 --> 00:29:15.807]  And I'll hit the news.
[00:29:17.708 --> 00:29:19.269]  And then Dr. Steve Pucinich is joining us.
[00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:26.674]  And then as I said, 6 o'clock tonight, I'm going to do a special report and then air the new film, The Clinton Body Count.
[00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.152]  It's posted at InfoWars.com, but with more info.
[00:29:30.352 --> 00:29:31.392]  Very important information.
[00:29:33.674 --> 00:29:37.917]  And then as I said, we'll play it by ear.
[00:29:37.957 --> 00:29:41.019]  It'll probably either be like 8 or 9 tonight, or it'll be tomorrow morning early.
[00:29:41.399 --> 00:29:46.963]  But we're gonna get out the Epstein New Revelations tonight or tomorrow.
[00:29:47.624 --> 00:29:50.385]  But I'll be up here late working on that with the Skeleton Crew.
[00:29:50.405 --> 00:29:55.149]  We've got a lot of folks who are on well-deserved time with their family, and you gotta turn a car's engine off occasionally.
[00:30:01.823 --> 00:30:02.723]  You've got my commitment.
[00:30:04.444 --> 00:30:14.425]  You see the energy level and your prayers and the discernment and the providence we've got because of all of us together praying to God with what Owen's doing and the rest of the crew.
[00:30:14.605 --> 00:30:21.227]  Everything we're doing right now is coming up, if you're playing blackjack, 21-21-21-21-21.
[00:30:21.347 --> 00:30:22.507]  And that's not us, that's God.
[00:30:22.547 --> 00:30:23.547]  That's not you, that's God.
[00:30:29.898 --> 00:30:32.361]  I know you know that, but we've got to strike while the iron's hot.
[00:30:32.681 --> 00:30:37.506]  God isn't giving us this type of providence and protection because we're so great.
[00:30:38.467 --> 00:30:43.172]  It's happening because we're willing to do it and God will use these imperfect vessels.
[00:30:45.054 --> 00:30:51.000]  But we have been given the commission to fight the enemy and we will carry it out.
[00:30:54.428 --> 00:30:57.791]  And I'll tell you this, a lot of people can see that I've lost a lot of weight.
[00:30:57.811 --> 00:30:59.032]  It's almost 40 pounds now.
[00:31:00.092 --> 00:31:05.997]  I'm eating the same way I was, everything, except I am religiously taking the supplements.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:23.150]  And when I take the krill oil, when I take the fish oil, when I take the Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, when I do all of this, my life is so much better and my focus is so much clearer, as you can see in here.
[00:31:24.127 --> 00:31:26.983]  And that's why you should give yourself the gifts.
[00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:36.112]  This Christmas, if you haven't ordered yet, with some of the biggest specials of the year, with storewide free shipping and double Patriot points, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:36.152 --> 00:31:41.336]  Take advantage of the big Christmas specials right now, and stock up on everything you need, or give it as gifts.
[00:31:41.837 --> 00:31:47.982]  Doesn't need to be Christmas to do it, but without your funds, we won't be here, so please take action at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:48.002 --> 00:31:57.029]  60% off RainForce Plus, 60% off Ultimate Krill Oil, 50% off Fluoride Free Super Blue Toothpaste, 60% off Vazo Beats, and so much more.
[00:31:59.036 --> 00:32:02.838]  Everywhere Christmas is under attack because at its heart is Christ.
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.760]  And it brings light into the darkness.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.301]  They don't like it.
[00:32:13.043 --> 00:32:14.864]  All right, let me start racing through the news now.
[00:32:16.865 --> 00:32:18.545]  Look at this story from Infowars.com.
[00:32:19.826 --> 00:32:25.629]  Christmas cards from China halted after slave labor in prison factory begs for help.
[00:32:26.009 --> 00:32:27.590]  This is mainstream news is covering this.
[00:32:29.161 --> 00:32:32.644]  And these are political prisoners in a prison that have to work.
[00:32:33.745 --> 00:32:35.186]  And they're working up to 18 hours a day.
[00:32:35.786 --> 00:32:40.250]  They put a letter inside the Christmas cards saying we are foreign prisoners being held.
[00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.090]  They list the prison.
[00:32:41.491 --> 00:32:42.652]  Forced to work against our will.
[00:32:42.712 --> 00:32:44.513]  Please help us and notify the Human Rights Commission.
[00:32:45.294 --> 00:32:55.322]  The girl had accidentally uncovered the chilling connection between British Christmas festivities and how Chinese prisoners are working factories to supply Western countries with holiday goods.
[00:32:57.421 --> 00:33:00.942]  Tesco said it was absolutely appalled on the reports of Christmas cards.
[00:33:01.463 --> 00:33:03.083]  We abhor the use of prison labor.
[00:33:03.763 --> 00:33:05.864]  Would never allow it in our supply chain.
[00:33:07.025 --> 00:33:08.145]  You're shocked and it goes on.
[00:33:09.626 --> 00:33:12.407]  My mom would always joke, we were at a Chinese restaurant when I was a kid.
[00:33:12.427 --> 00:33:19.909]  I don't know where she got it, I should ask her, but we'd be open to the fortune cookies and she'd say, help, I'm locked in a Chinese fortune cookie factory.
[00:33:22.811 --> 00:33:23.891]  You'd ask her where she got that.
[00:33:24.511 --> 00:33:26.272]  But now it's really happening.
[00:33:27.185 --> 00:33:29.306]  So art imitates life, or life imitates art.
[00:33:29.926 --> 00:33:30.446]  Here's another one.
[00:33:30.466 --> 00:33:33.447]  This is a Paul Joseph Watson article up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:33:34.407 --> 00:33:40.949]  In Europe, in the UK, they make children go to mosques and bow to Allah, but not churches.
[00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:43.510]  So it's a forcing you into it.
[00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:46.870]  It's in the German after-school programs.
[00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:50.572]  They tell 14-year-old girls to marry a 25-year-old Muslim man, even though it's illegal.
[00:33:50.592 --> 00:33:51.772]  I mean, this is all goes on.
[00:33:52.812 --> 00:33:54.573]  They let Muslims rape women and get away with it.
[00:33:54.593 --> 00:33:55.533]  I've got articles on that today.
[00:33:56.892 --> 00:33:57.832]  Teachers at U.S.
[00:33:57.873 --> 00:34:01.975]  school threatened to tell Muslim girls' parents after she removes a jib.
[00:34:04.236 --> 00:34:05.636]  She could have been stoned or killed.
[00:34:07.677 --> 00:34:12.520]  The teacher was going to do it, but after the principal heard, he said, no, no, no, as long as it's the dress codes being followed.
[00:34:15.041 --> 00:34:22.625]  That's the left trying to enforce Sharia law, which they fetishize because they see it as anti-Christian.
[00:34:27.264 --> 00:34:28.645]  Gotta read the article and get the details.
[00:34:31.368 --> 00:34:33.349]  Now here's an important Michael Schneider article.
[00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.931]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:34:36.993 --> 00:34:37.833]  This is America.
[00:34:37.893 --> 00:34:40.716]  Ten examples that show how dramatically the U.S.
[00:34:40.776 --> 00:34:42.558]  has changed as we approach 2020.
[00:34:42.818 --> 00:34:46.901]  The change our country needs is not going to happen in Washington.
[00:34:47.902 --> 00:34:48.503]  I agree with Michael.
[00:34:52.062 --> 00:34:55.105]  And then he goes over just some of the changes.
[00:34:55.125 --> 00:35:01.311]  Number one, the ACLU has started a campaign to make tampons available in all men's restrooms across America.
[00:35:02.371 --> 00:35:03.452]  Now, I mean, what is that saying?
[00:35:04.794 --> 00:35:14.703]  It's saying we're going to impose this ubiquitously and then make you do it and then make any privacy you have null and void as a form of dominance.
[00:35:20.302 --> 00:35:24.084]  Number two, senseless violence is all over the country.
[00:35:24.665 --> 00:35:30.909]  On Sunday, we witnessed the worst mass shooting in the city of Chicago, but it's black on black, so CNN's been ordered to cover it up.
[00:35:30.929 --> 00:35:31.909]  We're going to cover that next hour.
[00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:36.653]  Number three, it has been another banner year for homicides in Baltimore.
[00:35:36.833 --> 00:35:41.896]  Seven more people shot dead Sunday.
[00:35:43.655 --> 00:35:52.807]  State legislators in California keep talking about how much they love education, but once California has the highest percentage of residents that have never completed the ninth grade.
[00:35:56.231 --> 00:35:57.012]  It's all about design.
[00:35:58.714 --> 00:36:00.096]  Speaking of California, number five.
[00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:03.130]  Mark Siegel says the U.S.
[00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:15.554]  San Francisco has become a city that's awash in human waste because of all the drug addicts that are pooping wherever they feel like, and the new red diaper doper baby son of the Weatherman heads says it's freedom and he backs it.
[00:36:18.215 --> 00:36:24.637]  Number six, in our feels-good-do-it society of the traditional rules regarding sex, marriage and family have been discarded.
[00:36:25.353 --> 00:36:30.314]  This has paved the way for completely new arrangements that have seemed extremely bizarre to past generations of Americans.
[00:36:30.334 --> 00:36:37.397]  For example, the polyamorous woman in Florida has decided to raise her coming baby with all four of her partners.
[00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:47.199]  Number seven, last week the fact that a man was just sentenced to 15 years in prison for burning an LGBTQ flag.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.000]  Now where's your free speech go there?
[00:36:50.199 --> 00:37:00.266]  Number eight, meanwhile, illegal immigrants can commit serious crimes, a serious crime in the state of California, and just keep getting released, including arson, rape, and armed robbery.
[00:37:01.026 --> 00:37:07.951]  Number nine, in a brand new Netflix stand-up special, Michelle Wolf told Americans to get an abortion made her feel like a god.
[00:37:08.491 --> 00:37:09.492]  You gotta get that baby.
[00:37:09.512 --> 00:37:18.838]  Number ten, thirty years ago, two-thirds of the population of the country attended church services, at least somewhere regularly, but today, only about one-third do.
[00:37:20.097 --> 00:37:21.918]  And it goes on from there.
[00:37:25.001 --> 00:37:26.582]  And with it, the prosperity goes away.
[00:37:26.602 --> 00:37:26.802]  L.A.
[00:37:27.022 --> 00:37:27.283]  Times.
[00:37:27.323 --> 00:37:30.585]  California population growth slowest since 1900 as residents leave.
[00:37:31.326 --> 00:37:34.669]  Immigration decelerates because, see, the land of the free isn't there anymore.
[00:37:35.789 --> 00:37:39.232]  So it decelerates down as we settle into being third world.
[00:37:39.292 --> 00:37:42.755]  No more need to flood in because the country's been destroyed.
[00:37:46.701 --> 00:37:53.803]  Meanwhile, Christianity Today editor says his call for impeachment was hyperbole, now that it's totally backfired on them.
[00:37:54.783 --> 00:37:58.744]  Dr. Steve Pucinich wants to talk about that as well, when he joins us bottom of the next hour.
[00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:03.065]  Clinton impeachment judge, Trump impeachment is phony.
[00:38:07.206 --> 00:38:12.667]  Well, of course, it's completely and absolutely phony.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.281]  Now I want to get into the gun news when we start the next hour.
[00:38:17.321 --> 00:38:20.001]  There's quite a bit of that, how it ties into Virginia.
[00:38:27.482 --> 00:38:30.643]  But something I want to get into right now is some very good news.
[00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:39.085]  Young people in major polls, I got several articles on it, are against abortion of any type.
[00:38:39.885 --> 00:38:40.985]  And it's accelerating.
[00:38:42.398 --> 00:38:46.980]  The younger people get into teenage years of over 70% in most polls.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.341]  Some are in the 60s.
[00:38:49.221 --> 00:38:57.685]  And it's women, girls that are leading the charge in that, which shows all their propaganda is backfiring.
[00:38:58.845 --> 00:39:01.786]  And so the attempt to say, oh, it's fun to kill babies, try it out.
[00:39:01.826 --> 00:39:03.047]  Well, that's not going to work either.
[00:39:03.687 --> 00:39:06.248]  So there's a real revulsion happening.
[00:39:07.789 --> 00:39:10.050]  And that's the blind spot these Satanists have.
[00:39:11.889 --> 00:39:13.350]  And there's another big article, Bloomberg.
[00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:15.732]  The year socialism became a dirty word again.
[00:39:15.752 --> 00:39:20.376]  It was a bad year to be any kind of socialist in Europe.
[00:39:21.136 --> 00:39:26.440]  And then it just goes through how socialism is imploding and people are turning against globalism in general.
[00:39:27.181 --> 00:39:31.544]  We will get more into that coming up in the next hour.
[00:39:34.046 --> 00:39:34.747]  Please remember
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:41.021]  That we have put up part one of the Clinton Body Count, a documentary film.
[00:39:41.081 --> 00:39:42.182]  It's about 30 minutes long.
[00:39:42.562 --> 00:39:44.002]  It's extremely powerful.
[00:39:45.142 --> 00:39:46.823]  Looks like something you'd see on HBO.
[00:39:47.343 --> 00:39:48.303]  Gregg Rees put it together.
[00:39:48.323 --> 00:39:49.583]  Everybody really admires his work.
[00:39:50.144 --> 00:39:51.444]  It's featured at Man.Video.
[00:39:51.484 --> 00:39:52.664]  It just went live last night.
[00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:57.686]  Please send it out to everyone you know because you may know all about this, but a lot of other people don't.
[00:39:57.766 --> 00:39:58.926]  It ties into Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:40:00.666 --> 00:40:16.830]  And again, either tonight or tomorrow, we're going to release the latest Epstein information in a big special report, and then the big vaccine special report, proving it's deadly by design and so critical to get out to everyone you know, especially those that have children, and how they're coming with forced inoculation.
[00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:19.050]  That'll be out Christmas morning.
[00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:21.791]  And share the truth Christmas morning.
[00:40:22.111 --> 00:40:22.531]  Email it.
[00:40:22.791 --> 00:40:23.491]  Text message it.
[00:40:23.551 --> 00:40:24.092]  Facebook it.
[00:40:24.172 --> 00:40:24.652]  YouTube it.
[00:40:24.992 --> 00:40:25.832]  Get it out to everyone.
[00:40:26.912 --> 00:40:32.536]  And you won't get shadow banned for it because, or probably won't because it's not Alex Jones in the reports.
[00:40:32.716 --> 00:40:33.517]  And it's powerful.
[00:40:34.057 --> 00:40:35.358]  Rob has been working on it for three weeks.
[00:40:42.023 --> 00:40:44.965]  Also, the Attorney General is talking about the criminal activity of Soros.
[00:40:45.005 --> 00:40:46.206]  That is a major sea change.
[00:40:46.646 --> 00:40:53.711]  We will get into that and the latest on the coup against the President in the next hour.
[00:40:54.031 --> 00:40:56.133]  Please don't forget that
[00:40:57.247 --> 00:41:00.763]  You can still order Christmas presents anywhere in the continental U.S.
[00:41:03.015 --> 00:41:06.578]  You will get it, unless you're in a few mountain regions, but that isn't the reason to order this stuff.
[00:41:06.959 --> 00:41:09.201]  You should do it for your own Christmas gift of your own health.
[00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:20.331]  Everybody's seen how much healthier and focused I am, and it's because I'm taking the BioTrue Selenium, I'm taking the Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, I'm taking the X2 and X3, I'm taking the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I'm taking the fish oil.
[00:41:20.371 --> 00:41:22.593]  In fact, I've forgotten today, I want to take some krill oil.
[00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:23.534]  I took fish oil last night.
[00:41:23.554 --> 00:41:24.795]  It's so good for your heart.
[00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:25.595]  That's a new bottle.
[00:41:25.615 --> 00:41:26.656]  Where's my bottle I've been eating out of?
[00:41:26.696 --> 00:41:26.957]  Here it is.
[00:41:28.138 --> 00:41:29.419]  These are my little babies right here.
[00:41:30.836 --> 00:41:30.876]  Mm.
[00:41:30.956 --> 00:41:34.018]  I'm going to have two of these bad boys right now.
[00:41:35.679 --> 00:41:35.900]  Mm.
[00:41:38.521 --> 00:41:44.085]  Highest quality krill oil you're going to find, and what it does for your brain, what it does for your body, is spectacular.
[00:41:44.105 --> 00:41:49.209]  I take it before I go to sleep, too.
[00:41:49.489 --> 00:41:49.989]  60% off right now.
[00:41:50.009 --> 00:41:50.870]  I'm going to sell out quick.
[00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.652]  Infowarrestore.com is one of the biggest specials of the year.
[00:41:53.932 --> 00:41:56.154]  Double page repoints and free shipping, and it's going to end soon.
[00:41:56.474 --> 00:41:57.595]  Infowarrestore.com.
[00:42:08.385 --> 00:42:16.831]  Now, they call it an art project and admit it's all about Satanism and death.
[00:42:16.911 --> 00:42:21.954]  And then they're promoted by the entire power structure.
[00:42:23.215 --> 00:42:27.578]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's what it's all about.
[00:42:28.959 --> 00:42:29.979]  Searing our conscience.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.123]  Having all the simulated murder on TV and then when they do it for real, we don't care anymore.
[00:42:36.167 --> 00:42:37.450]  Assaulting our psyche.
[00:42:38.292 --> 00:42:43.102]  Sean Bowne filed a powerful report on this and we'll come back again with the latest assault of the second amendment.
[00:42:43.463 --> 00:42:44.365]  Here's Sean Bowne's report.
[00:42:44.923 --> 00:42:54.073]  We were missing something in our life, like, we didn't know what, and we started kind of exploring, and there were people on my side of the family that were like, you need to open your heart to Christ.
[00:42:54.273 --> 00:42:59.799]  And that means, you know, just asking Him and not opening your heart, you're not going to get an answer.
[00:42:59.839 --> 00:43:04.684]  You have to open your heart and open your mind to receiving Him.
[00:43:05.125 --> 00:43:06.706]  And when we did that, it was like,
[00:43:07.887 --> 00:43:08.628]  I knew it was true.
[00:43:08.868 --> 00:43:11.589]  It's going to get a lot better, but a lot of the churches are corrupt.
[00:43:11.649 --> 00:43:16.311]  The devil sends his people in there to do bad things to you, to turn you off to Christ.
[00:43:16.351 --> 00:43:17.091]  That's not Christ.
[00:43:17.151 --> 00:43:18.552]  Christ talked about that extensively.
[00:43:18.632 --> 00:43:25.335]  Pope Francis is taking major new steps to open up the Roman Catholic Church's handling of alleged sexual abuse by priests.
[00:43:25.495 --> 00:43:31.578]  The Vatican has announced that clergy abuse cases will no longer be handled as so-called pontifical secrets.
[00:43:32.058 --> 00:43:35.780]  Officials say that will allow bishops to cooperate more openly with police,
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:37.381]  And alleged victims.
[00:43:38.001 --> 00:43:41.304]  Just go directly to God, and it just gets stronger, it just gets better.
[00:43:41.624 --> 00:43:47.048]  The church has faced challenges over the centuries, and the latest could be one of its biggest.
[00:43:47.508 --> 00:43:48.289]  Abandonment.
[00:43:48.969 --> 00:43:53.633]  Studies show almost 6 in 10 millennials raised in the church have left.
[00:43:54.273 --> 00:44:00.238]  The background radiation of God's transmission is strong, but it doesn't force its way.
[00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:03.182]  The enemy forces its way in.
[00:44:03.362 --> 00:44:12.407]  You argue that evangelicals like yourself may like the president's platform, but you think he's grossly immoral.
[00:44:12.527 --> 00:44:18.691]  You described him as a near-perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused.
[00:44:19.071 --> 00:44:23.954]  He's abused his authority for personal gain, betrayed his constitutional oath.
[00:44:24.674 --> 00:44:32.919]  Other members of the evangelical community, including Billy Graham, your founder's grandson, have denounced this.
[00:44:34.599 --> 00:44:37.021]  Is the call for President Trump's removal growing?
[00:44:37.751 --> 00:44:38.151]  I don't know.
[00:44:38.171 --> 00:44:44.955]  I mean, in one sense, my call for his removal was on the order of hyperbole.
[00:44:45.495 --> 00:44:54.961]  In this regard, the odds of that happening either by election or Senate are actually probably fairly slim at this point.
[00:44:55.401 --> 00:45:00.184]  What I'm really arguing in the piece, fundamentally, is that the president is unfit for office.
[00:45:00.224 --> 00:45:02.065]  Now, that may be a distinction without a difference.
[00:45:04.306 --> 00:45:11.793]  But once you're aware of that, you can then, with your will, your consciousness, that's free will, tune to the channel.
[00:45:12.373 --> 00:45:17.518]  Even if you're in solitary confinement, being tortured, you can tune that out and tune right to Christ.
[00:45:17.958 --> 00:45:18.899]  And that's the secret.
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.341]  They train you to think third dimensional.
[00:45:21.361 --> 00:45:27.447]  You've got to go to a church, you've got to go to a leader, a priest, who then, on average, is a Satanist.
[00:45:28.268 --> 00:45:34.752]  In searing, damning language, the grand jury report revealed the dark secrets of the Catholic Church in Pennsylvania.
[00:45:35.173 --> 00:45:40.376]  Priests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them did nothing.
[00:45:40.736 --> 00:45:41.737]  They hid it all.
[00:45:42.017 --> 00:45:49.702]  It was child sexual abuse, including rape, committed by grown men.
[00:45:50.482 --> 00:45:50.963]  Priests
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:53.360]  against children.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:58.722]  The report found over a thousand child victims identified in the church's own records.
[00:45:59.063 --> 00:46:03.884]  The alleged crimes often described as inappropriate contact or boundary issues.
[00:46:04.144 --> 00:46:12.768]  It names more than 300 predator priests in six dioceses from one end of the state to the other, home to more than 1.7 million Catholics.
[00:46:12.948 --> 00:46:18.370]  And make you think that you found Christ so they can mislead you so you turn against Christ and don't believe in Christ.
[00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:20.391]  That's the devil's biggest trick and I would say
[00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:25.412]  Eighty percent of the churches in the world now, in big industrialized areas, are globalist-run.
[00:46:25.432 --> 00:46:27.293]  The World Council of Churches is run by the Rockefellers.
[00:46:28.274 --> 00:46:32.276]  And they're either worldly or they're secret atheists or leftists who went to the seminary.
[00:46:32.316 --> 00:46:33.097]  That's all been admitted.
[00:46:33.657 --> 00:46:35.218]  But then the higher-up ones are Satanists.
[00:46:35.278 --> 00:46:36.939]  People like the Pope and his deputy Pope.
[00:46:36.959 --> 00:46:37.679]  They're not Catholics.
[00:46:37.699 --> 00:46:38.319]  They're not Christians.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.501]  And that's their plan.
[00:46:40.881 --> 00:46:41.901]  That's how they mislead you.
[00:46:41.921 --> 00:46:46.284]  And Christ spent most of his time looking at the Pharisees and saying, they're the ones misleading you.
[00:46:46.304 --> 00:46:47.625]  They're not the real leaders.
[00:46:48.385 --> 00:46:49.786]  They are the synagogue of Satan.
[00:46:51.038 --> 00:46:52.318]  The clock is ticking.
[00:46:53.299 --> 00:46:56.820]  The globalists are scientifically moving against us.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:03.142]  Now, I've probably told this story a hundred times.
[00:47:03.782 --> 00:47:04.943]  It's definitely approaching that.
[00:47:05.023 --> 00:47:15.346]  And I'm going to tell it again, not because I have lack of news, because if you understand this, you understand the globalist mindset and how they're targeting everyone.
[00:47:18.527 --> 00:47:19.408]  Thank you for joining us again.
[00:47:19.428 --> 00:47:21.889]  We're into the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.831 --> 00:47:43.103]  A program that is dreaded, that is hated, that is reviled, that is lied about, that is demonized by the establishment, by the corrupt powers in control of this planet, by the countless twisted minions who serve the fraud.
[00:47:44.324 --> 00:47:45.025]  And why is that?
[00:47:47.066 --> 00:47:48.047]  Because I'm authentic.
[00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:49.972]  My crew is authentic.
[00:47:51.493 --> 00:47:52.733]  We're genuine.
[00:47:53.414 --> 00:47:53.814]  We're real.
[00:47:54.194 --> 00:47:54.795]  It's not a game.
[00:47:54.815 --> 00:47:55.415]  It's not a joke.
[00:47:55.735 --> 00:47:56.656]  We're not putting on airs.
[00:47:56.696 --> 00:48:02.099]  We're just real people who know what we're talking about and that work hard in defense of liberty, who are committed.
[00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.382]  And it's the journey of fighting corruption that has been so empowering.
[00:48:08.503 --> 00:48:12.045]  But the corrupt think cheating and stealing and lying is going to get them ahead.
[00:48:13.566 --> 00:48:16.908]  Now, many years ago, I was on an airplane flying to New York City.
[00:48:18.009 --> 00:48:18.509]  Beyond the view.
[00:48:21.357 --> 00:48:23.559]  They invited me back, but I didn't go.
[00:48:24.019 --> 00:48:25.361]  Beer on those hard pieces is a joke.
[00:48:28.423 --> 00:48:33.929]  And I was sitting next in first class to this individual.
[00:48:33.949 --> 00:48:34.889]  I said, I've seen you before.
[00:48:34.929 --> 00:48:37.131]  And he goes, yeah, I'm the head of this big bank.
[00:48:37.732 --> 00:48:38.693]  And he knew who I was.
[00:48:38.713 --> 00:48:44.138]  He'd been visiting his dad, who was a former army general in a nursing home in San Antonio.
[00:48:49.267 --> 00:48:51.929]  And we talked off and on for the three-hour flight.
[00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:54.251]  We talked more intensely the last hour.
[00:48:57.774 --> 00:49:03.639]  And towards the end, he said, listen, people adapt to being slaves.
[00:49:08.683 --> 00:49:09.683]  And he said, is this off-record?
[00:49:09.703 --> 00:49:11.385]  I'm not going to tell you this if it's off-record.
[00:49:11.665 --> 00:49:13.206]  I mean, obviously, you can say what I tell you.
[00:49:13.226 --> 00:49:14.227]  It's not going to matter.
[00:49:14.287 --> 00:49:16.449]  But just don't say who I am, and I'll tell you this.
[00:49:17.432 --> 00:49:23.793]  And he was very arrogant about it and very, you know, trying to size me up, like, project that he was powerful and dominant and the boss.
[00:49:30.355 --> 00:49:31.755]  And he said, you don't get it.
[00:49:31.815 --> 00:49:34.396]  You think they adapt and overcome like the Marines.
[00:49:37.137 --> 00:49:37.497]  No, no.
[00:49:37.777 --> 00:49:39.317]  People adapt to being slaves.
[00:49:42.518 --> 00:49:43.418]  And we're in full control.
[00:49:46.687 --> 00:49:49.248]  And technocrats are going to take over all the governments.
[00:49:50.688 --> 00:50:12.955]  Well that was about 10 years before at Davos they actually said with Zuckerberg and Bloomberg and Xi Jinping and Juncker and all of them and Gordon Brown that we're going to get rid of governments entirely and have the EU appoint leaders of governments and that we are technocrats and want a global technocracy.
[00:50:13.375 --> 00:50:15.596]  What an incredible statement!
[00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:18.211]  A planetary world government.
[00:50:21.372 --> 00:50:41.020]  But it's true that if we submit to them, and if we don't fight back, and we just give in to the poison, and just accept that we're all going to die early of cancer, and all going to have neurological disorders, and our IQ is going to go straight down, and that humans are obsolete, then if we just give in to it,
[00:50:43.004 --> 00:50:48.169]  And just accept it, then we are evolving, devolving, adapting to our own destruction.
[00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.432]  That's not improvising, that's not overcoming.
[00:50:56.577 --> 00:51:00.420]  But if you now look all these years later, they didn't believe that humanity could rally.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.362]  They didn't believe in human empowerment.
[00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:06.105]  But we only need a few percentage points to understand what's happening to defeat them.
[00:51:06.426 --> 00:51:07.487]  And we've got way more than that.
[00:51:09.062 --> 00:51:11.184]  And so now they could never see Hillary being defeated.
[00:51:11.224 --> 00:51:15.788]  They could never see all over the world populists winning election after election.
[00:51:16.229 --> 00:51:20.713]  And as they take away those elections, people demand even more destruction of the globalist system.
[00:51:21.173 --> 00:51:27.339]  And here's this big, long Bloomberg report from yesterday.
[00:51:30.021 --> 00:51:32.764]  The Year Socialism Became a Dirty Word Again.
[00:51:32.784 --> 00:51:35.246]  It's an eight-page article.
[00:51:37.492 --> 00:51:43.874]  And it says the technocrats of Europe, who were so cool just a few years ago, are now hated.
[00:51:44.374 --> 00:51:46.274]  And no matter where they are, they're being thrown out.
[00:51:46.794 --> 00:51:50.955]  And people that had accepted socialism as the future, now are rejecting it everywhere.
[00:51:56.117 --> 00:51:58.297]  They're losing everywhere where there's a real election.
[00:51:59.097 --> 00:52:03.598]  And the people now... You know, I told this story a couple years ago.
[00:52:04.679 --> 00:52:05.339]  My parents...
[00:52:06.892 --> 00:52:15.337]  We're in England, and multiple times when they heard they were from Texas, the taxi drivers said, oh Alex Jones, we love him, you know him.
[00:52:15.357 --> 00:52:18.758]  And when they'd say, well that's our son, well then everything was free.
[00:52:19.219 --> 00:52:20.159]  It happened in France.
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:24.742]  Now that's not me here going, oh look, I'm so cool.
[00:52:25.502 --> 00:52:27.183]  I'm saying that's a gauge.
[00:52:30.359 --> 00:52:36.104]  And I know a lot of people that live over in the UK, when they tried to stop Brexit the last four years, it only pissed people off more.
[00:52:36.465 --> 00:52:37.826]  And I predicted all of that.
[00:52:39.487 --> 00:52:43.291]  That, oh, they're going to hold it back and not give it to them, just like they never voted to enter the EU.
[00:52:43.611 --> 00:52:45.613]  So the same tyrants are going to try to block all of that.
[00:52:47.875 --> 00:52:49.696]  And that's just going to enrage people more.
[00:52:50.717 --> 00:52:54.361]  Because this is a long-term fight, and once people get into fighting,
[00:52:55.814 --> 00:52:56.634]  It's kind of like hiking.
[00:52:56.654 --> 00:52:57.895]  The first few times you do it, you get sore.
[00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:00.856]  Pretty soon you catch yourself hiking 10 miles, 15 miles, loving it.
[00:53:00.876 --> 00:53:02.116]  You're addicted to it.
[00:53:02.736 --> 00:53:03.337]  It's like fighting.
[00:53:03.357 --> 00:53:04.117]  You get addicted to that.
[00:53:05.777 --> 00:53:12.960]  Once you get into overcoming them, and you adapt to winning instead of adapting to be a loser, it's incredible.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:16.461]  So see, the world is telling you to adapt to being a loser.
[00:53:16.961 --> 00:53:19.482]  That's how you get patted on the head, but that's a false currency.
[00:53:19.762 --> 00:53:21.623]  You don't go anywhere with that except more slavery.
[00:53:22.998 --> 00:53:31.160]  You need to adapt to being a winner, and that starts with not letting them grind you down, and not submitting to them, and in little ways sabotaging them.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:47.763]  Whether it's sticking an InfoWars sticker in a bathroom stall, or calling into a talk show, or speaking out at your church, or buying a product at InfoWarsStore.com, or praying to God at night, or running for political office, or just being a good dad or mom.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.842]  Not buying from the globalist corporations?
[00:53:54.743 --> 00:53:56.004]  That's how you change the world.
[00:53:56.044 --> 00:53:58.467]  And you read this big long article, I could do the whole show just on this.
[00:53:59.888 --> 00:54:02.531]  And they admit they're being routed.
[00:54:10.179 --> 00:54:13.022]  Because you see, the world was asleep.
[00:54:14.175 --> 00:54:18.619]  And so that banker could make fun of everybody when they were asleep, but see, they're not asleep now.
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.602]  You may have masses of people that are basically gone.
[00:54:22.022 --> 00:54:23.063]  We're very sad for them.
[00:54:24.985 --> 00:54:27.667]  We're going to triage them, but we're moving forward.
[00:54:28.788 --> 00:54:29.789]  The whole article goes through it.
[00:54:31.131 --> 00:54:34.033]  It was a bad year to be any kind of socialist in Europe.
[00:54:34.153 --> 00:54:38.097]  The decline has been long and agonizing for the once dominant force, but in 2019,
[00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:47.235]  Falling popularity reached new depths and raised questions over whether reinvention could lead to revival.
[00:54:47.656 --> 00:54:48.356]  It's globalism.
[00:54:48.416 --> 00:54:49.677]  It's establishmentism.
[00:54:50.218 --> 00:54:50.999]  Everybody's done with it.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:55.803]  A decade ago, the Prime Ministers of Britain, Spain, Greece, and even Hungary
[00:54:56.513 --> 00:54:57.934]  We're from the center left.
[00:54:58.494 --> 00:55:02.556]  Many went on to swiftly lose power, but then socialist governments emerged in France and Italy.
[00:55:03.156 --> 00:55:06.118]  Now the political brand looks like an anachronism.
[00:55:06.738 --> 00:55:09.200]  But really it's open borders, Soros, globalism.
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.121]  And then it goes through how they're losing on every front.
[00:55:13.422 --> 00:55:15.123]  We'll talk more about this with Dr. Steve Pchenik.
[00:55:16.503 --> 00:55:19.285]  Coming up, I want to hit the gun control too.
[00:55:20.005 --> 00:55:21.506]  And the fake numbers they're putting out there.
[00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:27.340]  And more, and I also want to give you a little prelude to what's coming up on the Jeffrey Epstein special.
[00:55:29.921 --> 00:55:32.161]  It's going to be new revelations, really a big deal.
[00:55:32.902 --> 00:55:37.803]  And that's either going to be tonight, it'll be released, or it'll be tomorrow morning at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:55:38.463 --> 00:55:40.603]  And of course, Band.Video.
[00:55:41.704 --> 00:55:43.964]  We have the new film, The Clinton Body Count, out.
[00:55:44.064 --> 00:55:44.924]  It's live right now.
[00:55:45.545 --> 00:55:45.905]  It's free.
[00:55:46.105 --> 00:55:46.505]  Please spread it.
[00:55:47.725 --> 00:55:50.706]  We are back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:55:52.384 --> 00:55:57.366]  On this Monday, December 23rd, 2019 transmission.
[00:55:59.267 --> 00:56:06.070]  Now I wanted to get to a few of these stories here and tie it into what's really, really happening.
[00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:10.872]  Remember the Project Veritas CNN clip?
[00:56:10.912 --> 00:56:14.134]  We're going to play that here for you in just a second.
[00:56:14.674 --> 00:56:20.957]  Project Veritas, where they're talking to one of the producers and they say, oh, well, when there's a shooting in Chicago,
[00:56:22.264 --> 00:56:23.484]  And it's black on black.
[00:56:24.605 --> 00:56:27.125]  We don't cover it because white people don't care.
[00:56:28.466 --> 00:56:30.847]  Well, no, that's not really true.
[00:56:31.767 --> 00:56:32.887]  That's you saying that.
[00:56:35.608 --> 00:56:36.548]  That's the chicken or the egg.
[00:56:53.988 --> 00:56:58.110]  Meanwhile, Michael Bloomberg claims 21 students are shot every day.
[00:56:58.370 --> 00:57:00.631]  Anyone 18 or younger, he calls a student.
[00:57:00.792 --> 00:57:01.752]  It's not true.
[00:57:01.772 --> 00:57:04.273]  It's a totally fake number.
[00:57:04.313 --> 00:57:14.318]  And even the Washington Post and others admitted that Pelosi and he and others are putting out this info, giving her four Pinocchios.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:22.443]  So that's what they're doing, is they're lying about all this.
[00:57:23.442 --> 00:57:25.784]  There are about 23,000 deaths a year from guns.
[00:57:26.425 --> 00:57:28.406]  More than half of those are people committing suicide.
[00:57:29.247 --> 00:57:33.671]  And then you've still got more than 10,000 people being killed by guns.
[00:57:34.612 --> 00:57:37.774]  And most of those then are police and citizens killing criminals.
[00:57:38.295 --> 00:57:41.798]  But you end up with about 3,000 people or so that are usually innocent.
[00:57:41.818 --> 00:57:43.960]  You look at the numbers we've had Professor Lott on.
[00:57:45.216 --> 00:57:46.476]  One of the top status issues in the world.
[00:57:47.077 --> 00:57:50.898]  And so it's very rare for an innocent person compared to other deaths to be killed by a gun.
[00:57:51.358 --> 00:57:51.958]  It still happens.
[00:57:52.379 --> 00:57:55.360]  And when it happens, the media plays it up like it's the end of the world.
[00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:00.241]  It's like shark attacks are pretty rare, but you hear about them all the time because they hype them up.
[00:58:03.442 --> 00:58:05.723]  But it's way down the list of ways you're going to die.
[00:58:09.084 --> 00:58:11.845]  Do people blame baseball bats or hammers when people use them in murders?
[00:58:11.905 --> 00:58:12.085]  No.
[00:58:12.526 --> 00:58:12.946]  Or knives?
[00:58:13.826 --> 00:58:13.986]  No.
[00:58:14.227 --> 00:58:16.070]  Well, in England they are trying to do that.
[00:58:18.593 --> 00:58:21.919]  So here's from the vault back when Project Veritas caught this on tape.
[00:58:25.991 --> 00:58:36.018]  I think that shootings in poor areas or minority communities don't get as much coverage as if they were to happen in a white area.
[00:58:36.078 --> 00:58:40.781]  So CNN doesn't cover a shooting that happened in a black neighborhood the same that they would cover a shooting in a white neighborhood?
[00:58:41.101 --> 00:58:48.146]  I think unless if it were like a mass, if it were a mass shooting, like if there were like 20 people killed they would cover it, but if there were like two people
[00:58:54.775 --> 00:59:05.523]  And so that's why they play down the Democrat-controlled cities that literally have almost all the crime in the United States taking place in them, almost all the violent crime, because they've always been set up for that.
[00:59:06.544 --> 00:59:08.605]  The Democrats are an organized crime group.
[00:59:11.707 --> 00:59:14.669]  The movie The Gangs of New York's based on a composite of true stories.
[00:59:16.471 --> 00:59:17.431]  It's historical fiction.
[00:59:18.853 --> 00:59:19.533]  That's Democrats.
[00:59:21.675 --> 00:59:22.155]  In the movie.
[00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:27.212]  Using crime to control the city and racial division.
[00:59:27.952 --> 00:59:28.653]  Read the WikiLeaks.
[00:59:28.753 --> 00:59:29.413]  It's reality.
[00:59:32.695 --> 00:59:36.658]  Now, Howard Stern has had Jimmy Kimmel on and done big pieces attacking me.
[00:59:38.979 --> 00:59:40.800]  And he reportedly is doing pieces every week.
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:42.401]  And some of these are really funny.
[00:59:43.262 --> 00:59:47.344]  And I think the stuff you see on Stern's show is some pretty good comedy.
[00:59:47.364 --> 00:59:49.966]  I don't agree with the really vulgar stuff, but he's obviously a funny guy.
[00:59:52.547 --> 00:59:53.448]  And this latest piece
[00:59:54.702 --> 00:59:59.444]  Overall, I think it helps get the word out about Epstein, even though it makes a joke out of it.
[01:00:00.144 --> 01:00:03.025]  Except at the end when I talk about, oh, they want to kill white Christians.
[01:00:03.065 --> 01:00:05.846]  Well, the left does say white people are bad and the Christians are bad.
[01:00:05.866 --> 01:00:06.747]  I mean, that's a fact.
[01:00:07.067 --> 01:00:08.828]  And that's a problem of the left doing that.
[01:00:08.848 --> 01:00:14.510]  It's like Sacha Baron Cohen saying that replacement migration doesn't exist when it's official.
[01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:17.311]  But here's what Stern's been up to.
[01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.550]  Oh, Alex Jones wants to talk to us.
[01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:24.392]  He's upset that he is not going to be on Holly Weird Squares tomorrow.
[01:00:25.253 --> 01:00:26.133]  You want to talk to him?
[01:00:26.774 --> 01:00:27.534]  Why not?
[01:00:29.976 --> 01:00:34.659]  InfoWars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[01:00:36.747 --> 01:00:37.228]  That's right.
[01:00:37.548 --> 01:00:38.449]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:41.172]  Tomorrow's news today, InfoWars.com.
[01:00:41.212 --> 01:00:44.335]  We have been shadow banned by Google, Apple, YouTube, Facebook.
[01:00:44.715 --> 01:00:48.319]  And now, gloveless pedophile friend of Hillary Clinton, Howard Stern, good morning.
[01:00:48.539 --> 01:00:50.441]  Good morning, Mr. Jones.
[01:00:50.741 --> 01:00:51.762]  What's it say on your sweater?
[01:00:51.802 --> 01:00:52.383]  I can't read it.
[01:00:52.823 --> 01:00:55.144]  It says Epstein didn't kill himself.
[01:00:55.164 --> 01:00:56.925]  This is from our winter Epstein collection.
[01:00:56.945 --> 01:00:58.406]  We got tees, long sleeves, hoodies.
[01:00:58.666 --> 01:01:00.247]  Defend the resistance in style.
[01:01:00.447 --> 01:01:01.287]  Infowars.com.
[01:01:01.307 --> 01:01:03.068]  Infowars.com.
[01:01:03.108 --> 01:01:05.850]  I gotta tell you, your sweater is actually very attractive.
[01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:07.991]  I would imagine that's a big item.
[01:01:08.091 --> 01:01:08.751]  I would wear that.
[01:01:09.191 --> 01:01:09.992]  It's a big item.
[01:01:10.052 --> 01:01:15.795]  Our prices are as low as Jeffrey Epstein's heart rate after the Clintons killed him and executed him in his jail cell.
[01:01:15.815 --> 01:01:16.575]  Infowars.com.
[01:01:17.055 --> 01:01:21.318]  Yeah, now I understand you're upset because you're not going to be on Hollyweird Squares tomorrow.
[01:01:21.438 --> 01:01:32.205]  Howard, I was going to come on, I was going to expose the Prime Controllers and the Grays, and I was going to give you a side copy of my book, Alex Jones Exposes Globalist Pedophile Cults Again, which by the way, is the perfect stocking stuffer.
[01:01:32.485 --> 01:01:36.248]  We just went to number one on Roger Stone's prison reading list, and it looks great on a coffee table.
[01:01:36.468 --> 01:01:36.908]  Wow.
[01:01:37.149 --> 01:01:39.170]  Number one on Roger Stone's prison reading list.
[01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:40.631]  That's awesome.
[01:01:41.692 --> 01:01:43.973]  I am sorry about the mix-up with Hollywood Squares.
[01:01:44.113 --> 01:01:50.157]  You go have your Illuminati Antichrist holiday show, because I've got the InfoWars Christmas Spectacular.
[01:01:50.177 --> 01:01:52.519]  We have huge celebrity guests, giant games.
[01:01:52.539 --> 01:01:53.599]  You want to hear a quick preview?
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:54.080]  Yeah.
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:54.360]  Sure.
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:55.561]  All right, listen to this.
[01:01:56.902 --> 01:02:01.705]  It's the InfoWars Christmas Spectacular, starring Alex Jones.
[01:02:07.003 --> 01:02:09.164]  Come in!
[01:02:10.485 --> 01:02:14.527]  I've come to put gifts in your stocking and fluoride in your water.
[01:02:14.547 --> 01:02:15.848]  Hail Soros!
[01:02:16.948 --> 01:02:18.889]  And appearances by Arab Obama.
[01:02:22.418 --> 01:02:25.179]  What day do you celebrate, Arab Obama?
[01:02:25.719 --> 01:02:33.421]  And you won't want to miss Hollywood Pedophile Occult Squares.
[01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:37.982]  Center Square for the block, let's go to the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:43.003]  The Clintons killed me.
[01:02:43.023 --> 01:02:45.643]  The Infowars Christmas Spectacular, coming soon.
[01:02:45.664 --> 01:02:50.265]  If they'll march you into FEMA camps here, you're going to get all white bridges.
[01:02:52.857 --> 01:02:54.619]  Boy, I would watch that.
[01:02:54.639 --> 01:02:55.480]  Where's that going to be?
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.564]  Yeah, by the way, that sounds way more exciting than our Christmas special, honestly.
[01:02:59.664 --> 01:03:00.885]  InfoWars.com.
[01:03:00.905 --> 01:03:02.406]  Listen, Howard, my next guest is here.
[01:03:02.486 --> 01:03:04.488]  We have a known reptilian, Hillary Clinton, coming in.
[01:03:04.508 --> 01:03:06.050]  We're going to play Guess What's In My Gills.
[01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:12.676]  But before I go, Howard, what's your one-stop holiday shop for turbo health supplements at discount prices?
[01:03:12.736 --> 01:03:13.056]  I don't know.
[01:03:13.096 --> 01:03:14.198]  What is it?
[01:03:14.338 --> 01:03:15.619]  InfoWars.com.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.281]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:03:18.341 --> 01:03:20.102]  We got the Santa sale.
[01:03:20.122 --> 01:03:22.903]  60% off Turbo Force, Super Lume, Mind Milk, Eggnog, Fish Oil.
[01:03:23.223 --> 01:03:24.243]  I'm on all these products.
[01:03:24.484 --> 01:03:28.465]  And to you globalists who tell me I can't take my shirt off, well it's coming off!
[01:03:28.846 --> 01:03:30.966]  The battlefield is made in Hollywood, can't tell me what to do.
[01:03:31.187 --> 01:03:33.608]  The spirit of 1976 is alive!
[01:03:33.848 --> 01:03:36.249]  This is what optimal mail form looks like.
[01:03:36.529 --> 01:03:39.510]  SuperchargedMailVitalityInfoWars.com
[01:03:49.432 --> 01:03:51.153]  Do you really want to look like that?
[01:03:51.393 --> 01:03:52.014]  Yeah, I do.
[01:03:52.034 --> 01:03:53.475]  All right, well, thank you, Alex.
[01:03:53.515 --> 01:03:56.997]  I'm sorry about the mix-up, and we'll have you on for another show, okay?
[01:03:57.358 --> 01:03:58.739]  InfoWars.com, thank you very much.
[01:03:58.999 --> 01:04:00.740]  InfoWars.com.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.741]  I think he's right to be upset.
[01:04:03.622 --> 01:04:04.903]  We're not supposed to exist.
[01:04:06.684 --> 01:04:08.466]  This broadcast is not supposed to be here.
[01:04:10.507 --> 01:04:15.350]  But thanks to something called free association and human will, thanks to you,
[01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:25.018]  We are broadcasting on hundreds of radio stations, over 100 TV and cable stations, and with our own large audience at BandOnVideo.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:31.825]  But you are the wind in the sails, viewers and listeners, the men and women in the arena.
[01:04:31.845 --> 01:04:36.230]  It's your word of mouth that is the only currency of the realm.
[01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:40.132]  Well, Dr. Steve Pachetnik's been coming on the show 18 years.
[01:04:40.192 --> 01:04:47.277]  He's got a new, very censored book, and I've been interviewing him 18 years, and he never wants to come on about one of his books.
[01:04:48.518 --> 01:04:51.120]  I try to bring his books up, and he's just, no, I'm not going to get into it.
[01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:51.840]  I've got other stuff to do.
[01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:54.302]  He, of course, has written dozens of bestsellers.
[01:04:54.362 --> 01:05:01.387]  He was the main source for Tom Clancy, wrote a bunch of big books with him, was the Jack Ryan source in the book.
[01:05:01.688 --> 01:05:04.270]  Clancy openly talked about that.
[01:05:05.513 --> 01:05:07.275]  And now he does want to talk about this book.
[01:05:07.315 --> 01:05:08.817]  We're going to do it extensively in the next hour.
[01:05:08.957 --> 01:05:14.704]  American Warrior in Crisis, Tales of a Political Psychiatrist.
[01:05:14.745 --> 01:05:17.228]  He is a psychiatrist and a lot of other things.
[01:05:18.812 --> 01:05:24.435]  And he's gotten his other books made into big films, but boy, Hollywood will not touch this.
[01:05:24.495 --> 01:05:31.578]  So we're going to get to the book because it ties into all of this, but didn't need to talk to Dr. Pachinic before we got him on because he's a smart guy.
[01:05:32.058 --> 01:05:34.459]  He wants to get into exactly what I wanted to get into.
[01:05:34.479 --> 01:05:35.100]  Didn't even tell him this.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:48.366]  The impeachment coup, what's behind that, where we're going, and how to counter this corrupt, damaged, deep state that is losing power and what is emerging out of that.
[01:05:49.701 --> 01:05:58.193]  The big conflict with China and, of course, Jeffrey Epstein and really what Epstein was doing and really what he was up to.
[01:05:59.735 --> 01:06:04.041]  And I'm going to shoot a special report this evening that we're going to put up in the morning.
[01:06:04.101 --> 01:06:05.102]  I may put it up tonight.
[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:19.546]  Um, with a individual who wants to go on air and say who they are, but I'm going to tell them when they get here this afternoon that I really think that they might want to literally stay in the shadows just because they're still investigating and they've gotten a lot of stuff.
[01:06:19.626 --> 01:06:24.708]  I mean, you wouldn't believe what they've got.
[01:06:25.588 --> 01:06:26.409]  It'll make you lose sleep.
[01:06:27.572 --> 01:06:29.512]  But very dangerous stuff.
[01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:30.693]  I don't say that to act cool.
[01:06:30.733 --> 01:06:32.253]  I mean, this is really dangerous stuff.
[01:06:32.653 --> 01:06:36.754]  It's why I want to just get this out as soon as possible, because the danger is holding on to it.
[01:06:39.415 --> 01:06:40.695]  But everybody else is scared.
[01:06:42.235 --> 01:06:44.276]  So it's our job to do this.
[01:06:44.316 --> 01:06:45.236]  I've committed to do this.
[01:06:45.756 --> 01:06:50.157]  And so we're going to release this.
[01:06:51.328 --> 01:06:54.909]  The big stuff tonight or tomorrow and then more is coming.
[01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:56.689]  And by the way, this is all known.
[01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:59.430]  We won't get any attention for it.
[01:06:59.470 --> 01:06:59.930]  That's fine.
[01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.870]  We'll probably get death-threatened sued some more.
[01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:06.371]  But you'll see all this then on the national news in about a month is how it works.
[01:07:06.391 --> 01:07:09.332]  So it's our job to put it out to then force them to cover it.
[01:07:10.052 --> 01:07:15.673]  And it gets into the whole Project Veritas type stuff where the media knows and there's recordings of that and screenshots and all of it.
[01:07:15.713 --> 01:07:18.113]  And let's just say the Epstein stuff is still ongoing.
[01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:20.394]  He was only one guy and basically the fall guy.
[01:07:21.417 --> 01:07:28.299]  So Dr. Steve Pucinich has the floor for the rest of the hour and twenty-something minutes until Gerald Cilente takes over.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:33.301]  And I want to say Merry Christmas to all of our audience and to Dr. Steve Pucinich.
[01:07:33.621 --> 01:07:36.822]  I'm not going to get into his whole bio, but he helped run the Camp David Accords.
[01:07:36.842 --> 01:07:37.782]  That's how long he's been around.
[01:07:37.822 --> 01:07:38.762]  Helped found Delta Force.
[01:07:39.223 --> 01:07:40.643]  Done a whole bunch of stuff since then.
[01:07:41.083 --> 01:07:43.404]  He's on record, you know, overthrowing governments.
[01:07:43.464 --> 01:07:46.245]  He's talked about it on air before and gotten called into federal court over it.
[01:07:46.285 --> 01:07:49.126]  I mean, so he's got to be careful about the type of stuff he gets to hear on air.
[01:07:49.146 --> 01:07:50.026]  But you talk about a source.
[01:07:50.646 --> 01:07:52.168]  There's all these Q fantasies and stuff.
[01:07:52.188 --> 01:07:54.911]  I mean, this is a real guy that's been around a long time and knows a lot of stuff.
[01:07:54.931 --> 01:07:55.812]  This is a real deal here.
[01:07:56.392 --> 01:07:57.693]  And that's why he's showing his face.
[01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:00.376]  Didn't do that, you know, until the last few years.
[01:08:00.416 --> 01:08:01.918]  That's how serious the time is.
[01:08:01.938 --> 01:08:11.068]  So, Doc, tell us where we are right now from your perspective, how the coup against Trump's going, curveballs we should expect, and then what Epstein really is.
[01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:13.182]  Ah, this is great.
[01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:17.464]  Thank you for coming on and Merry Christmas to everybody and Happy Hanukkah.
[01:08:17.524 --> 01:08:26.246]  The reality of the coup is that when it fails, it fails quite prominently.
[01:08:26.526 --> 01:08:27.386]  And what is a coup?
[01:08:27.466 --> 01:08:29.487]  Let me explain to the audience several coups.
[01:08:30.127 --> 01:08:32.049]  I was involved in what you call a soft coup.
[01:08:32.069 --> 01:08:33.691]  That means we don't use military.
[01:08:33.751 --> 01:08:36.113]  We basically transfer power very quickly.
[01:08:36.233 --> 01:08:43.040]  It occurred during the Nixon administration when Nixon gave the rights over to Ford.
[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:48.766]  And in fact, the man who was important in that was Kissinger because he maintained the stability of the country.
[01:08:49.486 --> 01:09:00.415]  I was involved in other coups that were hard coups, which was in Italy, which means we use force or force had been used, or in Cambodia, where I had to disarm the Khmer Rouge.
[01:09:00.915 --> 01:09:10.863]  And ironically, now I can say because an Israeli operative died, I was involved in a coup, which Israelis did not know, the assassination of Rabin.
[01:09:11.063 --> 01:09:17.748]  This is the first ever heard of, because I had interviewed Rabin and I found him to be exceedingly depressed.
[01:09:17.848 --> 01:09:18.969]  I related to one of
[01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:25.216]  The other coups have to do with the Bush senior administration and the Bush junior administration where we transferred power.
[01:09:40.211 --> 01:09:41.732]  So what happens in a coup?
[01:09:42.033 --> 01:09:46.637]  In a coup, what happens, power is transferred very quickly and it's done quietly.
[01:09:47.197 --> 01:10:00.688]  What happened in this case was that Brennan and Clapper and Comey, that was the CIA and the FBI, got together from the very beginning under the auspices of Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[01:10:00.708 --> 01:10:02.970]  The Clinton administration would say, we don't want Trump.
[01:10:03.191 --> 01:10:04.512]  It was as simple as that.
[01:10:05.132 --> 01:10:11.835]  They then instituted what they called a hard and soft coup because they literally wanted to get rid of him.
[01:10:12.315 --> 01:10:29.702]  In turn, the FBI, which is a highly compromised institution, I mean highly, from the very beginning when it was created by a homosexual who, you know, J Edgar Hoover, they love to talk about him, but he was a cross-dresser, he was a nasty man.
[01:10:29.762 --> 01:10:33.104]  It wasn't the issue of cross-dressing, it was the issue that he had
[01:10:33.404 --> 01:10:33.964]  I think so.
[01:10:58.727 --> 01:11:03.808]  And it's an organization which has to be stripped down or literally taken apart.
[01:11:03.948 --> 01:11:05.389]  Comey is a disaster.
[01:11:05.889 --> 01:11:11.670]  He was a failed individual, as was Brennan, who was a CIA and director of the CIA.
[01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:14.831]  But he came out of what we call the analyst group, not the DDO.
[01:11:15.251 --> 01:11:16.471]  He created a company.
[01:11:16.511 --> 01:11:17.472]  He failed at that.
[01:11:17.572 --> 01:11:18.352]  And he kind of
[01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:31.852]  What I would say worked its way up the CIA hierarchy where he took care of a young African-American by the name of Obama, who was really a CIA operative, and his mother, Ann Dunham.
[01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:39.037]  So we're permeated with CIA, and it's not a conspiracy issue as much as it is.
[01:11:39.418 --> 01:11:40.719]  There are real problems.
[01:11:40.859 --> 01:11:47.684]  When you have somebody who comes totally out of the paradigm of the CIA or the intelligence network,
[01:11:48.144 --> 01:11:53.186]  And out of the paradigm of a politician like Trump, forget what Trump accomplished.
[01:11:53.226 --> 01:12:08.694]  The point is a man like Trump, who is a businessman, who doesn't really care about politics, who really cares about implementing outcomes, and he cares about building an ice skating rink, Walt the Memorial, as he did for my kids.
[01:12:09.094 --> 01:12:13.936]  He built 42nd Street, Fifth Avenue, Trump Towers, then the casinos.
[01:12:13.956 --> 01:12:16.057]  He likes to execute tangible things.
[01:12:16.906 --> 01:12:17.446]  Exactly.
[01:12:17.786 --> 01:12:21.327]  What he says in between is not as relevant as the end product.
[01:12:21.367 --> 01:12:28.069]  But we have never, never had a president of the United States who was that efficient and that much of a businessman.
[01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:30.370]  They like to say they were businessmen.
[01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:33.611]  The Bush seniors like to say they were in Zapata oil, but they weren't.
[01:12:34.051 --> 01:12:43.078]  They went down all the way from the Wasp Anglo-Saxons Northeast and went down to Texas to make believe they were oil diggers.
[01:12:43.178 --> 01:12:44.480]  And that's where Bush Jr.
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:44.880]  came out.
[01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:45.921]  He was an artifact.
[01:12:45.941 --> 01:12:51.125]  They were creating a Texas legend because nobody trusted the guys from Kennebugport, Maine.
[01:12:51.989 --> 01:12:52.690]  Now you got it.
[01:12:52.870 --> 01:13:00.157]  So you had that type of individual created by the agency, a product of the agency, and came out of the Northeast.
[01:13:00.517 --> 01:13:04.461]  Then we started having a power shift down to the South, as I told you.
[01:13:04.841 --> 01:13:11.728]  To Texas, down to North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, New York was losing power, Illinois.
[01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:12.489]  I want to keep you there.
[01:13:12.509 --> 01:13:13.049]  We've got to go to break.
[01:13:13.069 --> 01:13:14.611]  If you're giving a big picture, we'll get into Epstein.
[01:13:15.151 --> 01:13:15.891]  What is the United States of America?
[01:13:15.911 --> 01:13:18.452]  Well, we're told its existence is bad now by the Democratic Party and others.
[01:13:18.472 --> 01:13:20.053]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[01:13:42.745 --> 01:13:43.425]  What will we be?
[01:13:43.465 --> 01:13:44.185]  What is our culture?
[01:13:44.205 --> 01:13:44.705]  Hollywood?
[01:13:44.765 --> 01:13:45.786]  The Communist Chinese?
[01:13:45.826 --> 01:13:50.847]  The out-of-control John Paul Junkers of Europe?
[01:13:51.767 --> 01:13:52.767]  And their sickening past?
[01:13:52.827 --> 01:13:55.728]  I mean, we're being told to give up our identity because it's bad.
[01:13:58.169 --> 01:13:59.109]  And didn't become what?
[01:13:59.129 --> 01:14:01.870]  The truth is our real identity challenges tyranny.
[01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:08.771]  And so they want us to hate ourselves, but there's a rebirth of nationalism, of patriotism.
[01:14:09.371 --> 01:14:11.572]  Globalism is in crisis everywhere.
[01:14:13.066 --> 01:14:14.006]  They're going to strike back.
[01:14:14.807 --> 01:14:31.795]  But first we've got to set the table with the massive migration away from the blue cities, their death throes they're in right now, and what comes out of that, and then what we see happening in Israel, happening in Europe, happening here.
[01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:34.342]  Why they're so scared of Epstein?
[01:14:34.402 --> 01:14:35.922]  Who was Epstein really?
[01:14:36.342 --> 01:14:38.323]  What was he really doing?
[01:14:38.343 --> 01:14:39.644]  What was the Zorro Ranch?
[01:14:39.984 --> 01:14:40.884]  What was the eugenics?
[01:14:40.904 --> 01:14:42.385]  What was the breeding program?
[01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:46.607]  Well, we know pet projects of some of these globalists and their eugenics.
[01:14:47.287 --> 01:14:49.248]  I knew that before I read about Epstein and the sex stuff.
[01:14:49.288 --> 01:14:52.669]  I'd seen him involved with some of these globalists in bizarre behavior.
[01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:54.450]  So, Dr. Pachinik, we'd run into break.
[01:14:54.710 --> 01:15:00.993]  You had predicted here, been on air 18 years with us, but you predicted, I remember 15 years ago, you'd say, oh, the Northeast and
[01:15:02.335 --> 01:15:17.101]  You know, the blue cities in the west, it's all going to collapse, it's all going to move there, and there's going to be a, the EU is going to fall, they're finished, and the CHICOMs are going to, we're going to have a big war with them, economic, maybe physical, in the next 20 years, they're going to lose, and I mean, that's all moving that direction, so please continue.
[01:15:18.479 --> 01:15:19.360]  Here's what happens.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:23.324]  Epstein is an example of what happened in an institution.
[01:15:23.404 --> 01:15:24.445]  We're a republic.
[01:15:24.566 --> 01:15:28.209]  And Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats have had a real hard problem.
[01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:32.073]  And I had to instruct her through my videos that this is a republic.
[01:15:32.374 --> 01:15:33.976]  We are not a democracy.
[01:15:34.316 --> 01:15:36.338]  That means we're representational government.
[01:15:36.378 --> 01:15:38.020]  We have constantly had
[01:15:38.806 --> 01:15:42.849]  All kinds of factors within our republic that we've had to fight against.
[01:15:42.949 --> 01:15:44.089]  And that's correct, Alex.
[01:15:44.169 --> 01:15:48.852]  The reason we're very strong is that we're not really a soft nation.
[01:15:48.952 --> 01:15:53.315]  We're a very ruthless, tough, no-nonsense nation.
[01:15:53.815 --> 01:16:03.361]  Part of that is the fact that within our own governments, as a republic, we have to clean out those elements which are destructive to the people.
[01:16:03.841 --> 01:16:06.923]  For example, Epstein or the CIA, as I said.
[01:16:07.003 --> 01:16:13.526]  For a long time, I have been against the CIA only because they have served the purpose in the 1940s and 50s.
[01:16:13.947 --> 01:16:16.548]  And I will get to the history because it relates to Epstein.
[01:16:16.588 --> 01:16:22.311]  The CIA had to have a very close collaboration with another organization called the Mossad.
[01:16:22.732 --> 01:16:23.592]  Why the Mossad?
[01:16:23.672 --> 01:16:27.234]  Because the CIA was created by Philby, the Cambridge Five.
[01:16:27.574 --> 01:16:32.477]  Within the Cambridge Five, they were all homosexuals who had been at the University of Cambridge in England.
[01:16:33.187 --> 01:16:46.794]  One day, a gentleman by the name of Moshe Dayan came in and walked with James Jesus Angleton, who was head of our counterintelligence, and he said, excuse me, but do you understand that your whole CIA has been infiltrated and created by communists?
[01:16:47.374 --> 01:16:56.799]  As a result of that, the Mossad helped the CIA clean out all of the Cambridge Five and then came in the WASP, the White Anglo-Saxon Protestants.
[01:16:57.239 --> 01:16:57.339]  Yes.
[01:17:13.799 --> 01:17:28.271]  What we call doubling behavior, that is to compromise major politicians here and overseas and Prince Andrew and use a man like Epstein, who was a little Jewish man of no significance from Brooklyn.
[01:17:28.571 --> 01:17:31.053]  The same thing we had with Dershowitz.
[01:17:31.094 --> 01:17:34.817]  These were all Brooklyn Jews who thought they were smarter than they were.
[01:17:34.877 --> 01:17:36.478]  They had no real education.
[01:17:36.918 --> 01:17:40.380]  Epstein had never gone to MIT, never gone to Harvard.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:45.823]  But what happened was the Mossad really used him in conjunction with the CIA.
[01:17:46.283 --> 01:17:48.144]  That's why he has never been touched.
[01:17:48.284 --> 01:18:05.874]  And basically what he did, and this is what I was against for 40 years, and I warned the CIA, and I warned the Mossad, and I had arrested one of their operatives for two years after 9-11, that if you continue to infiltrate and destroy our republic, I will go after the Israeli operatives.
[01:18:06.514 --> 01:18:08.375]  And here is where the problem became.
[01:18:08.395 --> 01:18:10.076]  Epstein never died.
[01:18:10.216 --> 01:18:11.496]  He was never in prison.
[01:18:11.716 --> 01:18:12.817]  None of that is real.
[01:18:13.377 --> 01:18:24.402]  Unfortunately, Barr, who was our Attorney General, it was his father that gave Epstein the job at the Dalton School, which was an all-girls school, and he taught mathematics.
[01:18:24.862 --> 01:18:34.104]  The rest is up to conjecture, but it's not, because I've been involved with the CIA and knew that they were highly compromised because of the Mossad.
[01:18:34.384 --> 01:18:53.208]  And as a result of that, the Israeli Mossad has used Epstein to compromise MIT professors, George Church, Minsky, even the president of MIT, Raphael Rafe, whom I said to him repeatedly, how can you still remain as president of MIT when you were compromised and you would end the program?
[01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:54.228]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:18:54.688 --> 01:19:09.478]  I mean, you've got Epstein advertising that he's got these advanced research programs, getting Bill and Melinda Gates, getting Warren Buffett, getting Oprah Winfrey, getting Ted Turner at these secret institute meetings that came out in the news 15 years ago.
[01:19:09.518 --> 01:19:10.618]  That's how I knew about Epstein.
[01:19:11.259 --> 01:19:14.721]  And then Zorro Ranch and these breeding programs.
[01:19:15.181 --> 01:19:17.963]  I mean, there's a lot of stuff this guy was on top of.
[01:19:17.983 --> 01:19:18.844]  A lot of weirdness.
[01:19:19.929 --> 01:19:23.791]  Well, the weirdness was, part of it was created, he himself was weird.
[01:19:23.911 --> 01:19:33.837]  But the key element here to understand in our business of compromising people or doubling them up is that you never, never use children underage.
[01:19:33.877 --> 01:19:43.683]  When you double up in operatives and you use a honey trap, which is usually a woman for a man or a man for a homosexual, you do not use underage children.
[01:19:43.803 --> 01:19:46.425]  And this is where the CIA has to be held accountable.
[01:19:46.425 --> 01:19:46.906]  Thank you.
[01:20:02.942 --> 01:20:04.624]  I find him highly compromised.
[01:20:04.764 --> 01:20:07.446]  I find the Department of Justice highly compromised.
[01:20:07.766 --> 01:20:12.991]  So they can go all play around and make believe that they're indicting the FBI or Comey.
[01:20:13.031 --> 01:20:17.775]  But the reality is once you're implicated in a problem, you can't get out of it.
[01:20:17.835 --> 01:20:23.060]  When Barr said, oh, my God, Epstein committed suicide in the cell by himself.
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:24.101]  Give me a break.
[01:20:25.361 --> 01:20:32.563]  There's no such thing as committing suicide in a cell by yourself, and then in turn the story even got more absurd.
[01:20:32.683 --> 01:20:36.965]  That's why you become important as the alternative media, but it's the real media.
[01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:38.625]  So where did Epstein go?
[01:20:38.825 --> 01:20:48.068]  Usually we take these operatives and we send them off to Paraguay or wherever else, but he will never be held accountable, nor will the CIA, nor will the Mossad.
[01:20:48.468 --> 01:20:51.369]  And that's where people like myself come in and say, uh-uh.
[01:20:52.156 --> 01:20:53.337]  These days are finished.
[01:20:53.417 --> 01:20:55.799]  You can't get into this kind of stuff anymore.
[01:20:55.879 --> 01:21:01.504]  And then they'll say, oh, well, he's a Trumpite, or he believes in conspiracies.
[01:21:01.564 --> 01:21:03.526]  And that's why my book couldn't be published.
[01:21:03.806 --> 01:21:05.487]  I have the William Morris Agency.
[01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:06.208]  They're nice people.
[01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:07.189]  We're going to get to that next hour.
[01:21:07.209 --> 01:21:09.251]  I don't want to spend a lot of time on your book, but let's just go back.
[01:21:09.291 --> 01:21:11.693]  It is true that the body they took out of the stretcher
[01:21:12.333 --> 01:21:16.676]  And this was mainline photos, AP, you name it, is not the same ear.
[01:21:16.716 --> 01:21:18.497]  The ear doesn't even look halfway the same.
[01:21:18.697 --> 01:21:19.958]  Put that back on screen, please, guys.
[01:21:19.998 --> 01:21:22.219]  That's from the photo the Daily Mail everybody ran.
[01:21:22.539 --> 01:21:27.002]  That is a real photo, and it's not even the same ear.
[01:21:27.102 --> 01:21:29.303]  Looks nothing like it.
[01:21:29.383 --> 01:21:31.705]  I mean, for a man, I mean, think of it for a minute.
[01:21:31.765 --> 01:21:34.506]  You know, you know the dynamics of suicide and other people.
[01:21:34.586 --> 01:21:36.948]  You can't commit suicide by yourself.
[01:21:37.409 --> 01:21:37.990]  In a cell.
[01:21:38.130 --> 01:21:41.155]  I've run the Kremlin singing wards at St.
[01:21:41.216 --> 01:21:41.616]  Elizabeth's.
[01:21:41.676 --> 01:21:42.758]  Not with the paper sheets.
[01:21:44.375 --> 01:21:45.395]  No, of course not.
[01:21:45.515 --> 01:21:54.717]  And for William Barr to come up and pronounce these nonsense, and then say there was a storm of circumstances, this compromises Trump.
[01:21:55.037 --> 01:22:01.198]  So I would fire Barr, and I've said all along, where I find Trump is weak is he's not tough enough.
[01:22:01.699 --> 01:22:07.580]  I do not think he has people within the White House— Well, you said that about all of them two and a half years ago, so stay there.
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:09.280]  This is what I want to get into, because you mentioned it.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:13.261]  I want to finish up with the impeachment coup, what you think Trump needs to do.
[01:22:14.241 --> 01:22:16.922]  And then I want to get into your book, because people aren't supposed to hear this.
[01:22:17.543 --> 01:22:20.464]  The big publishers that have published your other stuff, they wouldn't even touch it.
[01:22:21.064 --> 01:22:23.105]  This is just all part of the censorship and control.
[01:22:23.145 --> 01:22:24.666]  Dr. Steve Pachinick is our guest.
[01:22:24.686 --> 01:22:26.987]  StevePachinick.com is his website.
[01:22:27.007 --> 01:22:29.348]  We'll put a link to that up on InfoWars.com.
[01:22:29.388 --> 01:22:30.789]  Some of the other issues he's going to cover.
[01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:33.170]  Christianity Today, that's blown up in their face.
[01:22:33.230 --> 01:22:34.191]  Facebook fascism.
[01:22:34.651 --> 01:22:36.932]  Mike Rogers, former NSA chief, he's got comments on that.
[01:22:37.272 --> 01:22:38.693]  John Durham and that investigation.
[01:22:39.093 --> 01:22:40.333]  Pelosi's downfall.
[01:22:40.774 --> 01:22:41.654]  Corruption of Hollywood.
[01:22:41.694 --> 01:22:43.235]  Mockingbird Media and how no one
[01:22:43.815 --> 01:22:44.175]  We're good to go.
[01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:06.787]  Thank you for your support.
[01:23:06.807 --> 01:23:07.448]  That's why we're here.
[01:23:07.728 --> 01:23:09.408]  But you need to support yourself.
[01:23:09.508 --> 01:23:11.229]  You really need to get the products we've got.
[01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:17.192]  The reason our products have five stars on third-party review sites is we've got the best turmeric bodies.
[01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:24.675]  We've got really high-end fish oil and krill oil, really good nootropic brain force, amazing 10-hour clean energy in turbo force.
[01:23:25.355 --> 01:23:30.757]  We really have great tooth whitening and remineralization toothpaste, super silver.
[01:23:31.038 --> 01:23:34.159]  We have the super blue with the tea tree, the coalital silver, and the iodine fluoride-free.
[01:23:35.148 --> 01:23:35.668]  We're good to go.
[01:24:03.246 --> 01:24:06.307]  A big eight-page cover story this weekend from Bloomberg.
[01:24:06.647 --> 01:24:08.367]  Socialism, it's a dirty word again.
[01:24:08.387 --> 01:24:12.608]  Globalism, EU elites, technocracy falling apart.
[01:24:13.789 --> 01:24:15.469]  And falling apart very, very quickly.
[01:24:15.929 --> 01:24:17.049]  Dr. Steve Macinnis, our guest.
[01:24:17.069 --> 01:24:18.410]  This is a short five-minute segment.
[01:24:18.730 --> 01:24:19.870]  A little one-minute break coming up.
[01:24:19.890 --> 01:24:30.893]  I want to get back into Epstein and the impeachment in that segment, but let me go back to really toot your horn, because it was at least 15 years ago, I've been interviewing you four or five years, that you were coming on going,
[01:24:32.031 --> 01:24:33.172]  And the EU is going to fall apart.
[01:24:33.192 --> 01:24:34.694]  It'll be a giant movement to topple that.
[01:24:34.714 --> 01:24:40.781]  And then, you know, the East Coast cities are going to start collapsing, and then they'll saturate with immigrants, but then that'll collapse.
[01:24:40.821 --> 01:24:41.342]  That's in L.A.
[01:24:41.362 --> 01:24:41.863]  Times today.
[01:24:41.883 --> 01:24:44.245]  And then there'll be a huge rebuilding.
[01:24:44.265 --> 01:24:50.553]  And at a certain point, states like Texas will start dictating to Washington, and if they do things we don't like, we'll just not follow it.
[01:24:50.773 --> 01:24:51.714]  Well, I was having dinner.
[01:24:52.675 --> 01:24:53.236]  I don't think so.
[01:25:13.194 --> 01:25:17.036]  And are already linking up to just not go along with the Blue Cities.
[01:25:17.096 --> 01:25:20.839]  So you have the Blue Cities and the Globalists trying to impose power on everybody.
[01:25:21.339 --> 01:25:22.500]  Really is an act of weakness.
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:27.223]  How are you, in the few minutes we have to break, able to accurately chart that and what do you chart coming next?
[01:25:28.571 --> 01:25:37.915]  It was very easy for me to chart it because number one, the worst thing that the Northeast had in the Midwest and California was huge taxes.
[01:25:37.955 --> 01:25:51.361]  So what happened is the hedge fund guys, the multimillionaires and the middle class all moved down to Florida, they moved down to Tennessee, they moved down to the South, they moved down to Texas where there were no taxes and it was easier lifestyle.
[01:25:51.841 --> 01:25:56.804]  Number two, the power systems in Washington DC were no longer relevant.
[01:25:56.924 --> 01:26:01.987]  I've said for a long time, if Trump hadn't been there, we really wouldn't have needed a president.
[01:26:02.107 --> 01:26:11.693]  And the reality of what you're seeing now, forget the Epstein phenomenon, because that's the end of the CIA, the FBI, and a whole bunch of people who attempted to have a coup there.
[01:26:12.033 --> 01:26:12.694]  It didn't work.
[01:26:13.114 --> 01:26:14.855]  The other part is the impeachment part.
[01:26:15.075 --> 01:26:15.355]  We're
[01:26:32.789 --> 01:26:33.069]  Yeah.
[01:26:51.015 --> 01:26:51.395]  I think?
[01:27:06.258 --> 01:27:10.663]  How does she explain 85,000 homeless in San Francisco?
[01:27:10.823 --> 01:27:14.287]  Even the New York Times went out of its way to say this is disgraceful.
[01:27:14.607 --> 01:27:15.568]  Look at the video.
[01:27:15.909 --> 01:27:19.112]  Then they have 85,000 homeless in Los Angeles.
[01:27:19.173 --> 01:27:23.557]  And now all the industry's pulling out and now no one's having conferences there.
[01:27:23.597 --> 01:27:27.261]  I mean, this is redline cardiac arrest.
[01:27:28.035 --> 01:27:28.475]  Correct.
[01:27:28.575 --> 01:27:30.797]  It's not only cardiac arrest, Alex.
[01:27:31.017 --> 01:27:35.619]  It's a self-destructive impulse that kept coming in again and again.
[01:27:35.659 --> 01:27:40.942]  You have multi-billionaires out of, you know, the high-tech areas in the Hollywoods.
[01:27:40.982 --> 01:27:42.243]  The Hollywood is finished.
[01:27:42.643 --> 01:27:46.626]  When you get a movie like The Irishman, which cost $180 million and it's junk,
[01:27:49.427 --> 01:27:54.250]  I vote for the Academy Awards, and I'll vote for a movie like Harriet that costs $3 million.
[01:27:54.630 --> 01:28:13.259]  But $180 million for Robert De Niro, who doesn't even serve our country, who shoots his mouth off against the president, a man who's never had a formal education, a man who went to the Red School, which is a communist school, never really could articulate anything or write anything decent, shoots his mouth off.
[01:28:13.579 --> 01:28:17.601]  Or Robert Redford, who had no education and comes out of Santa Monica.
[01:28:18.081 --> 01:28:19.922]  This is what we had out of Hollywood.
[01:28:20.063 --> 01:28:20.803]  It's finished.
[01:28:21.083 --> 01:28:21.744]  It's gone.
[01:28:22.204 --> 01:28:23.285]  We have the Roku.
[01:28:23.385 --> 01:28:24.746]  We have streaming.
[01:28:24.926 --> 01:28:26.307]  So Hollywood is finished.
[01:28:26.587 --> 01:28:27.988]  California is finished.
[01:28:28.088 --> 01:28:29.289]  What's becoming important?
[01:28:29.569 --> 01:28:30.050]  Texas.
[01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:35.653]  I've always said Texas, in and of itself, could secede from the Union and wouldn't need the rest of the Union.
[01:28:36.074 --> 01:28:39.596]  Florida can secede from the Union and wouldn't need the rest of the Union.
[01:28:40.036 --> 01:28:44.760]  In effect, what I'm saying, de facto, the South has risen again.
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:51.544]  It has risen in a way that belies the lies of Abraham Lincoln and the Northeast establishment.
[01:28:51.564 --> 01:28:52.484]  Hold on, we gotta go to break.
[01:28:52.504 --> 01:29:08.934]  Back in the 60s, the corrupt in New York, a lot of great people lived there, but the establishment, the corrupt in Los Angeles and San Francisco are like dying cobras, fat on the blood of America, now angry that we're removing them from our throats so they just bite us again and again.
[01:29:08.954 --> 01:29:11.695]  We already took the full load of poison.
[01:29:11.715 --> 01:29:14.337]  We've kind of grown used to it.
[01:29:16.015 --> 01:29:17.415]  In fact, it's what gets us out of bed in the morning.
[01:29:18.636 --> 01:29:23.117]  And all the intimidation, all the threats, it just doesn't work anymore because we were asleep.
[01:29:24.197 --> 01:29:25.037]  Now we're awake.
[01:29:25.457 --> 01:29:26.857]  They thought we were intimidated.
[01:29:27.317 --> 01:29:31.298]  No, we were just mesmerized by Hollywood, mesmerized by the left.
[01:29:31.358 --> 01:29:34.959]  And now, people can't run away from it fast enough.
[01:29:35.959 --> 01:29:38.340]  All the metrics show the really young people, Generation Z,
[01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:44.634]  Not the Millennials, some of them are awake, but mainly the new Generation Z, people under 20.
[01:29:45.294 --> 01:29:47.476]  They don't buy anything the system says.
[01:29:47.536 --> 01:29:49.718]  They can't stand the establishment.
[01:29:50.018 --> 01:29:51.519]  They want authenticity.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:52.860]  They want real.
[01:29:53.681 --> 01:29:56.363]  And the establishment's now hitting all their emergency buttons.
[01:29:56.423 --> 01:30:02.128]  They admit that what Dr. Steve Pchenik's been saying on this show for 15 years isn't just wishful thinking.
[01:30:02.248 --> 01:30:03.229]  It's unfolding.
[01:30:03.429 --> 01:30:04.310]  So continue.
[01:30:05.506 --> 01:30:20.104]  Wherever you want to go now, I want to finish up with Epstein, and for me the big story is the corporate media knew about Epstein, knew what was going on, pliantly covered it up for 13 years, and that still the same groups are doing the same crap.
[01:30:21.411 --> 01:30:27.613]  The same payloads, the same procurement, that's what I'm going to be exposing tonight, and they're doing nothing!
[01:30:28.133 --> 01:30:33.095]  And the media has this, and they're not just scared, they know you don't touch it.
[01:30:33.775 --> 01:30:38.697]  And so it's very, very shameful, and it'll be the nails in their political coffins.
[01:30:39.017 --> 01:30:50.741]  Anything else in that whole area of Epstein that I want to get into impeachment, the death throes of the Dems, but I don't want to be too confident because they could certainly try to, like a giant squid, take us down with them.
[01:30:52.243 --> 01:30:52.744]  Not really.
[01:30:52.764 --> 01:30:57.368]  I mean, the Democratic Party, as it is now, is in the throes of death.
[01:30:57.468 --> 01:31:01.271]  I mean, Nancy Pelosi is really singing a swan song.
[01:31:01.711 --> 01:31:05.314]  Her manipulation to try to get it into the Senate is not working.
[01:31:05.775 --> 01:31:10.619]  And basically, that was her last swan song to say to somebody, I have no more power.
[01:31:11.019 --> 01:31:13.521]  And I'm playing the game and I'm playing bluffing.
[01:31:14.742 --> 01:31:35.363]  The real issue right now is that we will continue to exist, as you said General Zee, whatever the Millennials are, but here in the South I have young men and women who are in the Christian movement at the same time they serve in our National Guard, at the same time they teach, so there's a whole generation of young men and women here in the South
[01:31:35.683 --> 01:31:39.985]  That will become our new leaders, very much like DeSantis, who was in the military.
[01:31:40.345 --> 01:31:43.367]  You're seeing more CIA operatives going into Congress.
[01:31:43.427 --> 01:31:48.149]  You see more military individuals, as I predicted, would go into the Congress and Senate.
[01:31:48.389 --> 01:31:52.811]  Once we have that, we have people who understand we can no longer go to wars.
[01:31:52.891 --> 01:31:54.271]  We can't go to Vietnam.
[01:31:54.311 --> 01:31:55.432]  We can't go to Korea.
[01:31:55.492 --> 01:31:56.592]  We can't go to Iraq.
[01:31:56.913 --> 01:32:02.295]  We can't go to Afghanistan and listen to all these chicken hawks like the Bush Juniors or the Obama
[01:32:02.355 --> 01:32:06.320]  Elaborate on that because it's not combat veterans and people that want to start senseless wars.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.822]  They want to get things fixed before that.
[01:32:08.223 --> 01:32:16.293]  It's only the chicken hawks that have never been in combat who are obsessed with it because they believe it's manly and tough and they make huge amounts of money out of directing it.
[01:32:17.199 --> 01:32:17.539]  Correct.
[01:32:17.719 --> 01:32:30.886]  And so we go back to, let's say, John F. Kennedy, who was totally psychotic, had Addison's disease, had the greatest number of wars that anybody had ever seen, and of course, he was taken care of by a guy named Fort Myer and others, Alan Dulles.
[01:32:31.186 --> 01:32:34.308]  We had LBJ, who had increased the war presence.
[01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:41.531]  And let me ask you that question, because I want you to, because you're a psychiatrist, you've studied JFK, you have the medical records and, you know, run major memo awards, and then look at Bobby.
[01:32:42.012 --> 01:32:43.973]  Why would the mafia put them in power?
[01:32:45.113 --> 01:32:47.135]  And then why would they instantly turn on them?
[01:32:48.216 --> 01:33:09.797]  Because, number one, you gotta understand, Joe Kennedy and what's happening now with the Epsteins, the Bronfmans and the Maxwells, were all part of the Jewish-Italian-Irish gang that came out of the Bronfmans making alcohol in Canada, transporting it through Joe Kennedy's trucks into Cleveland with Luciano,
[01:33:10.357 --> 01:33:16.481]  And Meyer Lansky were then distributing it out to all of the distribution channels.
[01:33:16.641 --> 01:33:21.265]  And basically, that type of coalition has been there for years.
[01:33:21.425 --> 01:33:24.887]  That's why you had the Maxwells involved in the Epstein case.
[01:33:25.227 --> 01:33:27.949]  You had the Brothmans involved in the Epstein case.
[01:33:28.289 --> 01:33:33.293]  It was an antiquated system that was reignited by the CIA and the Mossad.
[01:33:33.693 --> 01:33:34.754]  Those days are gone.
[01:33:35.214 --> 01:33:41.404]  That's finished because the CIA and our intelligence systems really isn't all that good anymore.
[01:33:41.964 --> 01:33:46.211]  Gina Haskell has never been held accountable for torturing people.
[01:33:46.511 --> 01:33:50.798]  In other words, we have a system that really holds nobody accountable for anything.
[01:33:51.198 --> 01:33:53.479]  Gina Haskell has not been accountable for this.
[01:33:53.759 --> 01:33:55.180]  Epstein was not accountable.
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:57.921]  The people who ran Epstein is not accountable.
[01:33:58.261 --> 01:34:06.424]  The presidents who ran 9-11 and did false flags into Iraq and Afghanistan, Cheney, Bush Jr., Obama.
[01:34:09.585 --> 01:34:18.849]  It's obviously being used as a set piece to try to blackmail in different power structures, but it is a big detonator that could blow them up because it obviously feeds into a whole bunch of different networks and groups.
[01:34:18.909 --> 01:34:20.610]  What are you expecting to happen with that?
[01:34:20.630 --> 01:34:21.530]  Where do you think that's going?
[01:34:21.570 --> 01:34:23.071]  And what would you advise Trump to do?
[01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:26.872]  What I would advise Trump to do is fire half of the people.
[01:34:27.013 --> 01:34:31.795]  I've never seen so many people in the White House, particularly 2,000 people on the NSC.
[01:34:32.155 --> 01:34:33.055]  That is absurd.
[01:34:33.075 --> 01:34:34.936]  I would start, you know,
[01:34:35.658 --> 01:34:41.819]  Getting rid of all of these people in the White House, decrease it from about thousands to a couple of hundred.
[01:34:41.879 --> 01:34:48.401]  The way James Baker ran it, the way it was run under the Shultz administration, a very tight administration.
[01:34:48.441 --> 01:34:50.181]  The Epstein's of the world are finished.
[01:34:50.241 --> 01:34:53.762]  There's no accountability and they're not going to go back to an accountability.
[01:34:54.122 --> 01:35:00.704]  Because if they start that accountability, a lot of people would be in prison and they can't do it and nor do they have the guts to do it.
[01:35:01.384 --> 01:35:09.794]  And Barr is going to be one of those people who would have to be held accountable for this nonsense to say, oh, yeah, well, we had a prison guards, but they were asleep.
[01:35:10.215 --> 01:35:11.056]  That's nonsense.
[01:35:11.176 --> 01:35:16.983]  So what we have right now is we have to keep going on and say, all right, where are we going from here?
[01:35:17.043 --> 01:35:19.626]  Well, Brexit, I got to give credit to Boris Johnson.
[01:35:20.126 --> 01:35:23.250]  He really came to a point that I didn't think was possible.
[01:35:23.370 --> 01:35:31.999]  And the reason Brexit occurred and I could predict it was that France was trying to neutralize Germany in the 1950s and they created the EU.
[01:35:32.459 --> 01:35:39.386]  The fact is that Germany was in two world wars, had really defeated France in two world wars, and once again in the 2020s
[01:35:41.308 --> 01:35:41.649]  Thank you.
[01:36:02.421 --> 01:36:08.663]  Angela Merkel, a PhD in nuclear physics, can run Germany because Germany is a very tough country.
[01:36:08.964 --> 01:36:11.164]  It doesn't matter where they are and what they're going to do.
[01:36:11.204 --> 01:36:14.166]  They're going to be the primary force in the EU.
[01:36:14.526 --> 01:36:16.086]  But England will break away.
[01:36:16.206 --> 01:36:19.007]  Boris Johnson has been more effective than anybody else.
[01:36:19.047 --> 01:36:20.468]  He'll make an alliance with
[01:36:20.988 --> 01:36:21.348]  Trump.
[01:36:21.448 --> 01:36:31.032]  Trump, in turn, will bring him into the Canadian and Mexican agreement, and then he will bring him into the China agreement, where everybody said he couldn't do it.
[01:36:31.372 --> 01:36:33.053]  We're going to have an agreement with China.
[01:36:33.193 --> 01:36:40.376]  At the same time, we do have tensions with China, and I predicted that in one of my books, Pax Pacifica, Blood Heat.
[01:36:40.436 --> 01:36:45.318]  I said that the Spratly Islands would be populated by the Chinese 20, 30 years ago.
[01:36:46.178 --> 01:36:48.761]  Well, the Chinese are all over South China Sea.
[01:36:49.181 --> 01:36:56.350]  And now they went into a country that I helped to create through the Bush administration, and that was Cambodia.
[01:36:56.450 --> 01:37:00.694]  It was I who put Aung San, who's now been a leader there for 37 years.
[01:37:00.754 --> 01:37:06.341]  And we used to say then, 37 years ago, that the warmest part of Aung San was his glass eye.
[01:37:06.781 --> 01:37:18.484]  But he was a Khmer Rouge, I had Pol Pot, I had Q Sao Pong, and we had to make a deal, which was called the Paris Peace Accord 1991, which I write all about in the book in detail.
[01:37:18.704 --> 01:37:27.066]  I had to bring back criminals to put them into a peace treaty, along with Claude Martin from France, the Russians who were very helpful.
[01:37:27.546 --> 01:37:27.626]  Yes.
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.801]  Then Pompeo.
[01:37:48.322 --> 01:37:51.163]  He's supposedly smart, but I haven't seen it.
[01:37:51.904 --> 01:37:57.487]  He tends to go into every field, he tends to have a short attention span in these fields, and then he leaves.
[01:37:57.807 --> 01:37:59.568]  He's not a strategist, although he is number one.
[01:37:59.588 --> 01:38:00.189]  All right, stay there.
[01:38:00.249 --> 01:38:01.890]  I want to get into this whole list of things.
[01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:07.893]  I want to get into your book, and I want to get into more of how you see the election and the impeachment and coup unfolding.
[01:38:07.913 --> 01:38:08.433]  We'll be right back.
[01:38:09.314 --> 01:38:12.636]  I'm Alex Jones, Dr. Steve McChinney, our guest, InfoWars.com.
[01:38:12.676 --> 01:38:14.017]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:38:16.971 --> 01:38:24.695]  All right, I've got a lot of questions for our guest, and in the last segment of this hour, I'm going to open the phones up for like five, six people just to ask a quick question.
[01:38:24.715 --> 01:38:25.615]  It's Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[01:38:26.196 --> 01:38:26.896]  The number's 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:38:26.916 --> 01:38:28.357]  This is a short segment, longer segment coming up.
[01:38:28.377 --> 01:38:31.598]  I got so much to get into, and I am going to read your book.
[01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:50.937]  Let's plow into your new book and why Hollywood tried to suppress it and block it and why they're scared of it.
[01:38:50.957 --> 01:38:51.998]  I mean, I can't wait to read it.
[01:38:52.338 --> 01:38:57.102]  American Warrior in Crisis, Tales of a Political Psychiatrist.
[01:38:57.162 --> 01:38:58.723]  And it's got a wild cover.
[01:38:59.364 --> 01:38:59.984]  Dr. Pachetnik?
[01:39:01.025 --> 01:39:06.810]  The cover was done by a very talented woman by the name of Renee.
[01:39:07.882 --> 01:39:11.624]  She was the granddaughter of Adrian Rogers, Renee Rogers.
[01:39:11.844 --> 01:39:18.148]  And Adrian Rogers, as many of you would know, was one of the premier Southern Baptists in this country.
[01:39:18.528 --> 01:39:21.470]  And one of the things that I think is important to understand is that
[01:39:22.276 --> 01:39:27.677]  Christianity is the fundamental concept or overlay faith in the United States.
[01:39:27.937 --> 01:39:31.358]  It's Judeo-Christian concepts that created this country.
[01:39:31.798 --> 01:39:32.798]  We're not Muslims.
[01:39:32.838 --> 01:39:34.019]  We're not Hindus.
[01:39:34.059 --> 01:39:34.419]  We're not.
[01:39:34.559 --> 01:39:35.879]  We welcome everybody.
[01:39:35.999 --> 01:39:38.600]  But you have to come in here and pay the price.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:39.800]  So why did I write the book?
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:42.761]  I wrote a book about a kid who came from Cuba.
[01:39:42.801 --> 01:39:46.802]  He's Jewish from the Holocaust and comes into Harlem.
[01:39:46.902 --> 01:39:47.622]  And what does he do?
[01:39:47.822 --> 01:39:48.782]  I mean, does he either
[01:39:49.622 --> 01:39:50.203]  I think so.
[01:40:14.662 --> 01:40:15.463]  Well, I think
[01:40:32.283 --> 01:40:37.929]  And they're discriminatory and at the same time they are ruthless and sadistic.
[01:40:37.969 --> 01:40:50.102]  So Cornell Medical School suddenly becomes from an anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, anti-woman, anti-black school, becomes the wild medical school by Sandy Weil, who is a corrupt
[01:40:51.372 --> 01:40:54.974]  A banker of Citibank and gives hundreds of millions of dollars?
[01:40:55.014 --> 01:41:00.557]  You got a real education about how crazy parts of the establishment had been because they they weren't people that built the country.
[01:41:00.877 --> 01:41:03.419]  They had just taken over the power and you saw the megalomania.
[01:41:04.386 --> 01:41:05.007]  Exactly.
[01:41:05.087 --> 01:41:15.218]  And to this day, I still say to the President Pollack, you know, why don't you come and do something honest instead of propagating the nonsense that you're doing at Cornell University?
[01:41:15.258 --> 01:41:17.340]  Well, suddenly I'm going to Harvard.
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:19.182]  And who was compromised at Harvard?
[01:41:19.362 --> 01:41:19.822]  Epstein.
[01:41:19.883 --> 01:41:25.829]  And a guy, the president of Harvard, is named Beko, who went to MIT and served under Rafael Reif.
[01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:39.019]  And when I go to MIT, it was a formidable school because I was trained by Lucian Pye, by people like Howard Laswell, politics and psychology, and by an institution called the CIA and Defense Advanced Research Project.
[01:41:39.459 --> 01:41:41.561]  I was trained by them, but I never belonged to them.
[01:41:41.661 --> 01:41:44.063]  So in the military, they made me a captain.
[01:41:44.523 --> 01:41:47.265]  And at the same time, I was a DAS and a medical doctor.
[01:41:47.285 --> 01:41:55.812]  But it allowed me, because I tend to be bold and not self-righteous, I can come in and say to Jimmy Carter, look, you're not running the Hanafi
[01:41:56.032 --> 01:41:56.092]  Yes.
[01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:13.741]  Thank you.
[01:42:31.113 --> 01:42:34.576]  But he warned me that there's going to be an invasion and Bush Sr.
[01:42:34.936 --> 01:42:35.777]  was going to do that.
[01:42:35.857 --> 01:42:36.538]  And guess what?
[01:42:36.638 --> 01:42:41.162]  There was an invasion and it was useless for the same reason that Bush Sr.
[01:42:41.202 --> 01:42:42.183]  went into Iraq.
[01:42:42.543 --> 01:42:42.983]  Useless!
[01:42:43.544 --> 01:42:44.665]  And what happens then?
[01:42:44.905 --> 01:42:54.433]  I go from Noriega and then I go on to the Maryland Savings and Loan where I see none other than Pelosi's family, a corrupt father, a corrupt brother,
[01:42:54.853 --> 01:42:58.836]  Corrupt governor, corrupt bankers, corrupt SNLs.
[01:42:58.896 --> 01:43:01.577]  I take them all over and guess what happens?
[01:43:01.637 --> 01:43:11.043]  The guys from Drexel and others become, again, they reconstituted through MIT and Harvard and all the institutions, but we don't hold anybody accountable.
[01:43:11.423 --> 01:43:12.624]  Nobody goes to jail!
[01:43:13.264 --> 01:43:16.586]  And I'm saying to myself, wow, this is amazing, this country.
[01:43:16.967 --> 01:43:18.648]  You can commit all kinds of crimes.
[01:43:18.748 --> 01:43:24.751]  But if you say anything about Obama, which I said on the radio, yeah, he's a CIA operative.
[01:43:24.952 --> 01:43:25.872]  That's fine with me.
[01:43:25.952 --> 01:43:26.433]  I don't care.
[01:43:26.453 --> 01:43:28.454]  But why don't you tell that to the American public?
[01:43:28.774 --> 01:43:32.757]  By the way, his mother's Ann Danham, who was also a CIA operative.
[01:43:32.817 --> 01:43:40.241]  And by the way, his maternal grandmother and grandfather worked for me at the East West Center in Hawaii, and they were CIA bankers.
[01:43:40.361 --> 01:43:41.222]  And guess what I get?
[01:43:41.682 --> 01:43:46.845]  A $20,000 subpoena saying I've got to go see the prosecutor in Florida.
[01:43:47.185 --> 01:44:01.493]  It cost me $20,000 and lawyers who were incompetent to address the fact that I had to deal with something called the Aldamaro kidnapping, which I had to deal with the fact that Aldamaro was assassinated by the Red Brigade.
[01:44:01.993 --> 01:44:03.194]  Was I involved in that?
[01:44:03.254 --> 01:44:06.196]  I won't go into the details, but I did what I had to do.
[01:44:06.997 --> 01:44:09.298]  And in fact, that was only the beginning of it.
[01:44:09.358 --> 01:44:11.299]  And then I had to take down the Soviet Union.
[01:44:11.319 --> 01:44:13.100]  Well, how do you take down the Soviet Union?
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:20.423]  Do you suddenly make expansive statements or do you become like the CIA and make believe you're shooting and non-shooting?
[01:44:20.463 --> 01:44:30.348]  Well, I turned out to spend a lot of time in the Soviet Union in the 70s because I was director of the National Institute of Mental Health International Division, which was one position, me.
[01:44:30.728 --> 01:44:34.530]  But I spent a lot of time with the KGB and I spent a lot of time with
[01:44:35.050 --> 01:44:44.536]  People in the psychiatric hospitals and Kachenko and I write about that and what the Soviets were doing was exactly what's happening to Christians all over the world.
[01:44:44.976 --> 01:44:47.137]  We talk about Jews having been persecuted.
[01:44:47.217 --> 01:44:53.681]  I keep saying about Christians and why I spent my life trying to save them from barbaric institutions.
[01:44:54.041 --> 01:45:04.347]  The Kachenko Psychiatric Hospital put away Christians as political dissidents and what I did was to commoditize those Christians and say to the head of this who was
[01:45:05.207 --> 01:45:09.149]  Stalin's right hand man, I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna commoditize Christianity.
[01:45:09.449 --> 01:45:15.972]  I'm gonna give you five wank computers for one Christian, six wank computers for another, but I'm gonna take out 20 different Christians.
[01:45:16.012 --> 01:45:22.115]  We're not gonna say they're Christians, we're not gonna say they're dissidents, but I'm gonna give you wank computers, and that's how it worked.
[01:45:22.475 --> 01:45:26.797]  Then eventually I saw the fact that the Soviet Union wasn't really producing any.
[01:45:26.837 --> 01:45:33.440]  So you're saying underground Christian networks were key to the taking of the Soviet Union, and now Russia's becoming very Christian right now,
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:35.761]  And that enrages Hollywood.
[01:45:36.641 --> 01:45:43.325]  Well, what should enrage Hollywood and should enrage all the Democrats is that they're too stupid to understand.
[01:45:43.805 --> 01:45:45.806]  We put in Vladimir Putin.
[01:45:46.186 --> 01:45:48.967]  I was involved in the takedown of the Soviet Union.
[01:45:49.528 --> 01:45:55.391]  And part of the Soviet Union, it's in the agreement 20 years ago, is Crimea.
[01:45:55.971 --> 01:45:58.252]  Russia did not invade Crimea.
[01:45:58.312 --> 01:45:59.993]  Crimea belongs to Russia.
[01:46:00.393 --> 01:46:01.554]  For hundreds of years.
[01:46:01.594 --> 01:46:12.184]  So all this nonsense about the invasion of Crimea or the Ukraine... A lot of this sounds like to people like, this guy sounds crazy, all these exaggerations, but I've actually looked at the history books.
[01:46:12.224 --> 01:46:14.366]  You did run the Camp David Accords, the only successful deal.
[01:46:14.666 --> 01:46:16.188]  You were involved with the Pol Pot stuff.
[01:46:16.488 --> 01:46:17.849]  You were involved with the Soviet Union.
[01:46:18.069 --> 01:46:25.977]  You've done all this stuff because you actually do work instead of sit around and talk about how you're an intelligence op and sit around in a bar bragging and patting each other on the back.
[01:46:26.337 --> 01:46:29.739]  Let's come back and talk about all this straight ahead and get into what's coming next.
[01:46:30.079 --> 01:46:31.340]  So much more with Dr. Steve Pacheco.
[01:46:33.461 --> 01:46:35.062]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:46:35.082 --> 01:46:35.543]  to 3 p.m.
[01:46:35.563 --> 01:46:36.183]  we're here live.
[01:46:36.203 --> 01:46:37.524]  David Knight, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[01:46:37.564 --> 01:46:39.805]  Owen Schroer, The War Room, 3 p.m.
[01:46:39.825 --> 01:46:40.466]  Central, every day.
[01:46:41.046 --> 01:46:48.611]  Tonight, 6 o'clock, we're going to air extended coverage of the Clinton Body Count documentary film at Bandai Video and on the radio and TV satellite feeds.
[01:46:49.431 --> 01:46:50.332]  And I'll be there with you.
[01:46:51.653 --> 01:46:55.155]  And then sometime tonight or tomorrow morning, I'm going to release this bombshell FC information
[01:46:56.927 --> 01:46:57.653]  All right, Dr. Puccini.
[01:46:58.906 --> 01:46:59.767]  Very interesting book.
[01:47:00.347 --> 01:47:14.096]  You've got a lot of best-selling books and never wanted to promote them on air, so I'm kind of picking up from this book that I haven't read yet that it's a memoir of a lot of the amazing things you witnessed, that you saw from your very varied life and all the interesting places you've gone.
[01:47:14.116 --> 01:47:25.964]  And I would guess, you know, a lot of this bird's-eye but also fly-on-the-wall level view is information that really nobody outside of a very few people has ever been privy to.
[01:47:25.984 --> 01:47:27.485]  So this is really a groundbreaking book.
[01:47:29.804 --> 01:47:31.605]  It's in many ways, it's groundbreaking.
[01:47:31.685 --> 01:47:40.508]  It really is just a simple story, which I wanted to say, look, I'm a refugee, came to the United States, and I was asked to serve in this country.
[01:47:41.108 --> 01:47:43.909]  And I said, fine, I'm more than happy to serve.
[01:47:44.449 --> 01:47:48.691]  I was the only one who was drafted out of 88 doctors in my medical school.
[01:47:49.211 --> 01:47:49.831]  And I knew that.
[01:47:50.172 --> 01:47:56.254]  And I said, fine, if I'm going to serve, let me tell you what, I want to be the best educated cadaver on any battlefield.
[01:47:56.474 --> 01:48:00.636]  And they sent me to med school, residency, and MIT.
[01:48:00.956 --> 01:48:03.277]  And as a result, I served the military.
[01:48:03.418 --> 01:48:06.279]  I was at a rank for about 10 seconds of rear admiral.
[01:48:06.639 --> 01:48:08.420]  But I never accepted a uniform.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.640]  I never accepted a rank.
[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:10.881]  And I didn't want to get paid.
[01:48:11.642 --> 01:48:18.410]  And to this day, I still work with different elements of the intelligence community because that's my service and I'm proud to get it.
[01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:19.551]  And here's the next thing I want to get at.
[01:48:19.691 --> 01:48:28.121]  Give us your gestalt or approximation of the current battlefield state, who the main blocks are, what Trump's doing right and wrong because
[01:48:28.982 --> 01:48:30.303]  This is beyond censorship.
[01:48:30.383 --> 01:48:36.548]  Big Tech now has AI in control, blocking photos of Melania saying it's hate, blocking photos of yours truly.
[01:48:37.069 --> 01:48:41.232]  Women at the shooting range, women saying they like Trump, they're being blocked, they're being told you'll be banned.
[01:48:41.993 --> 01:48:45.836]  So there's real, beyond 1984 surveillance in place.
[01:48:46.336 --> 01:48:51.700]  They're blocking the political advertising while letting Democrats operate advertising under the guise of news.
[01:48:52.841 --> 01:48:55.443]  Sure, the Republicans have raised more money, but they can't spend it.
[01:48:56.243 --> 01:48:57.083]  Because they won't let them.
[01:48:57.504 --> 01:48:58.764]  This is fundamental tyranny.
[01:48:58.824 --> 01:49:01.205]  So I get you don't interrupt your enemy when they're destroying themselves.
[01:49:01.605 --> 01:49:02.626]  The Democrats are in trouble.
[01:49:02.686 --> 01:49:03.566]  It's blowing up in their face.
[01:49:03.686 --> 01:49:04.326]  I understand that.
[01:49:04.686 --> 01:49:10.469]  But we're barely able to stay on air, and we were a bigger organization that had other ways of getting stuff out.
[01:49:10.529 --> 01:49:12.209]  Everybody else is being destroyed.
[01:49:12.710 --> 01:49:16.251]  Trump keeps saying he's going to do something, but we're not seeing that.
[01:49:16.271 --> 01:49:18.172]  Meanwhile, Big Tech, as you know, has moved to China.
[01:49:18.652 --> 01:49:18.872]  I don't
[01:49:30.131 --> 01:49:37.158]  We're talking about a national security crisis, and of course I'm sure there's some plan to have stuff that sets the Chinese up within that.
[01:49:37.178 --> 01:49:37.918]  I'm sure it's a trap.
[01:49:38.579 --> 01:49:41.282]  But still, this is all just incredibly out of control.
[01:49:41.982 --> 01:49:44.605]  And I get we're going into a war footing with China, that's good.
[01:49:45.245 --> 01:49:52.032]  But beyond Huawei, Apple basically acts worse than Huawei, and Trump's parading around with Tim Cook.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:54.901]  I don't disagree with you.
[01:49:55.001 --> 01:50:03.751]  And that's one of the problems I've had with Trump, that he isn't strong enough to demand new personnel in the White House and fewer.
[01:50:04.637 --> 01:50:16.201]  One of the elements that's coming to the forefront in our administration and in the Trump administration, I can't go into detail for other reasons, is the fact that we're getting into Cyber Command and Cyber Control.
[01:50:16.922 --> 01:50:27.746]  In the beginning, for the past 10 years before, I was involved with a gentleman by the name of Keith Alexander, who was really the father of Cyber Control and Cyber Command at the NSA.
[01:50:28.406 --> 01:50:32.289]  Then it was given over to Admiral Mike Rogers who did a brilliant job.
[01:50:32.349 --> 01:50:37.392]  He came out of the Navy and he was the one who said, look, this is what the reality is.
[01:50:37.472 --> 01:50:39.653]  This is where we're headed and this is where we're going.
[01:50:39.713 --> 01:50:43.856]  And now we have a General Nakasone who's involved in Cyber Command.
[01:50:44.016 --> 01:50:55.323]  I can't go into the total details, but I can say this, that the problem of the present companies that are too large and too big and out of control is real.
[01:50:55.951 --> 01:51:01.353]  And if they continue, there will be legislation and there will be demands from within the government.
[01:51:01.533 --> 01:51:15.278]  And it will come from the military side of the government, which is also civilian, because Cyber Command now brings in both civilian and military elements to say, OK, you guys have too much power and we're going to start breaking it up.
[01:51:15.902 --> 01:51:19.725]  And that's what you can expect to see in terms of Facebook.
[01:51:19.865 --> 01:51:21.706]  That's what Zuckerberg has to face.
[01:51:21.726 --> 01:51:26.490]  You're going to see that with respect to Google, which is totally out of control.
[01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:33.194]  And the irony was I brought in the founders of it from the Soviet Union when they were just kids, seven years old.
[01:51:36.015 --> 01:51:38.416]  I'm demonetized as you are.
[01:51:38.436 --> 01:51:39.496]  And here's the irony.
[01:51:39.796 --> 01:51:46.237]  You bring in those very people who are now going to create the very element that might destroy me or you.
[01:51:46.337 --> 01:51:53.578]  But at the same time, I have full faith that we can continue now and that Trump will be stronger in the next administration.
[01:51:53.738 --> 01:51:55.159]  I believe he will be elected.
[01:51:55.599 --> 01:51:58.279]  I believe the impeachment has no relevance whatsoever.
[01:51:58.299 --> 01:51:59.379]  There's a lot of noise.
[01:51:59.839 --> 01:52:03.320]  But at the same time, we do have to deal with the Chinese
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:05.741]  Sure, what's the Space Force?
[01:52:19.079 --> 01:52:22.520]  And what you're saying is there's a million people with the top security clearance in our corporations.
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:27.581]  Just like William Benny says, the NSA's built for everybody to go into it secretly.
[01:52:27.641 --> 01:52:29.262]  That's the big national security threat.
[01:52:29.562 --> 01:52:35.023]  Sure, it lets the bureaucracy play God, but now they've given up any real power they have to centralize state actors.
[01:52:35.563 --> 01:52:39.925]  And why the hell would they build a Swiss cheese, you know, backdoor labyrinth into everything?
[01:52:39.945 --> 01:52:40.965]  It needs to be reversed.
[01:52:42.546 --> 01:52:43.166]  I agree with you.
[01:52:43.206 --> 01:52:46.148]  Number one, the NSA is not the predominant power anymore.
[01:52:46.188 --> 01:52:51.311]  You have to go to an institution that's been created about nine to ten years ago.
[01:52:51.431 --> 01:52:54.692]  Clapper, ironically, was the first director, but he's not anymore.
[01:52:55.053 --> 01:52:57.334]  And that is the National Geospatial Agency.
[01:52:57.574 --> 01:53:01.435]  And that brings us next to Space Force, which is really Space Command.
[01:53:02.396 --> 01:53:06.597]  And of course, that's really a whole other separate, I would say, breakaway government or shadow government.
[01:53:06.998 --> 01:53:09.959]  I mean, from my perspective, what is Space Force?
[01:53:09.979 --> 01:53:16.501]  We know it's a bunch of different elements that Trump is trying to now make into a new branch of the military.
[01:53:16.801 --> 01:53:18.542]  How would you quantify what Space Force is?
[01:53:20.017 --> 01:53:25.140]  I would quantify it as saying it's the counterforce to the civilian equivalent of NASA.
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:37.568]  NASA was a primary base under which guys like, you know, Boeing could come in and create their starship, but it didn't work.
[01:53:37.628 --> 01:53:43.932]  And that was a basis for which private corporations, even some government corporations, could send up a rocket.
[01:53:44.432 --> 01:53:48.415]  But Space Force has a very strong element of the military aspect.
[01:53:48.455 --> 01:53:58.901]  And what I mean by military is, right now we have in space all kinds of satellites really shooting and attacking each other for quite some time.
[01:53:59.542 --> 01:54:01.283]  And we don't talk about it.
[01:54:01.563 --> 01:54:06.266]  But honestly, we do need a component where we have our own rockets.
[01:54:06.286 --> 01:54:07.387]  We're not as dominant as we were.
[01:54:07.467 --> 01:54:09.448]  The Chi-Coms are destroying our satellites.
[01:54:09.568 --> 01:54:11.830]  We need to have somebody go out there and wipe a bunch of them out.
[01:54:12.782 --> 01:54:14.924]  Well, we were not dominant for many years.
[01:54:15.024 --> 01:54:25.972]  As a matter of fact, I was shocked that for 20 years, from Montana onward, in order to launch a satellite into space, we had to pay the Russians about $75 million.
[01:54:26.312 --> 01:54:27.713]  And again, that's sabotage.
[01:54:27.793 --> 01:54:30.876]  Why did we get rid of the Saturn rocket plans and all that?
[01:54:30.896 --> 01:54:32.397]  There's been clear sabotage at NASA.
[01:54:34.409 --> 01:54:36.530]  I can't tell you the specifics of it.
[01:54:36.610 --> 01:54:42.413]  NASA has its own bureaucracy, which is quite huge, and it's located in Titusville.
[01:54:43.493 --> 01:54:47.915]  I know something about it, but I can't pretend to say that I really know a lot about it.
[01:54:48.176 --> 01:54:59.681]  And at this particular point, I do know that we're shifting over to the NGA, we're shifting over to Cyber Command, we're shifting over to a militarized space unit, which is not related.
[01:54:59.741 --> 01:55:02.022]  So that's one way for Trump not to just fire everybody.
[01:55:05.804 --> 01:55:06.905]  Well, that's correct.
[01:55:06.965 --> 01:55:10.106]  But at the same time, he does have to start firing.
[01:55:10.246 --> 01:55:16.750]  And that cannot... He has to have somebody inside who can say, no, no, no, this has to be cut.
[01:55:17.050 --> 01:55:21.012]  You can't have 75,000 people at the State Department.
[01:55:21.292 --> 01:55:23.413]  It's an antiquated institution.
[01:55:23.793 --> 01:55:28.756]  Even though I enjoy the Foreign Service officer, I really don't need political ambassadors.
[01:55:28.956 --> 01:55:34.040]  Well, sir, anybody knows, even in their business or their household or anywhere, if you get too many people, no work gets done.
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:36.982]  They all just have bureaucratic meetings and mess with each other all day.
[01:55:37.002 --> 01:55:40.345]  We're going to come back and take calls with great questions for Dr. Steve Machinigan.
[01:55:40.365 --> 01:55:47.370]  I'm going to ask him more about, because he's not a guy to make stuff up, about having a hand taking out that particular Israeli Prime Minister back in the early 1990s.
[01:55:47.451 --> 01:55:50.413]  I'm going to ask him about that a little bit more.
[01:55:50.533 --> 01:55:53.956]  And then, Gerald Solente, always informative, is coming up.
[01:55:54.496 --> 01:55:54.796]  And then...
[01:55:55.837 --> 01:56:02.938]  Six o'clock tonight, I'm going to be back live with the Clinton body count documentary, and then we're going to drop the big Epstein bombshells.
[01:56:03.058 --> 01:56:03.399]  Stay with us.
[01:56:26.508 --> 01:56:28.130]  Well, the statement is this.
[01:56:29.331 --> 01:56:36.939]  I had gone to see him as an officer of the State Department because I was a psychiatrist and I was with someone else I don't want to identify.
[01:56:36.959 --> 01:56:44.626]  I basically saw clinically that he was exceedingly depressed and I asked him, is there anything we can do to help you?
[01:56:44.746 --> 01:56:45.467]  And he was just
[01:56:47.462 --> 01:57:15.162]  Slow talking slow movement and all that and I mentioned it to somebody I do not want to identify who's who's dead now who was one of the Key operatives in the Mossad and he worked in the United States and I said, you know, you've got to deal with this Prime minister and it wasn't an assassination that I had in mind on the contrary I was thinking of you know, asking him to leave and then treating him but the reality was that I
[01:57:15.971 --> 01:57:30.958]  Ishaq Rabin knew very well that he was totally depressed and when he was asked actually by the Shin Bet, the head of the Shin Bet, as I understand, you know, do you want anything to protect you or, you know, any bodyguards?
[01:57:31.438 --> 01:57:36.300]  And it was revolving around the Oslo Agreement and I was not involved in the Oslo Agreement.
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:37.801]  I didn't think it was much of anything.
[01:57:38.281 --> 01:57:45.829]  It was just a lot of hoo-ha that Clinton and Dennis Ross and others created, which wasn't equal to what was done in Camp David Accord.
[01:57:46.710 --> 01:57:52.096]  And Rabin said no, he didn't want bodyguards and he didn't want a bulletproof vest.
[01:57:52.577 --> 01:57:55.460]  And that was the last I had heard about it.
[01:57:56.281 --> 01:58:05.977]  And I knew very well when the assassination occurred and it was supposedly over the Oslo Agreement in support, I knew that wasn't really the case.
[01:58:06.297 --> 01:58:07.719]  But be it as it may,
[01:58:08.479 --> 01:58:15.803]  That was an indirect way of saying, you know, there was a problem in Israel and they had to deal with it.
[01:58:15.923 --> 01:58:21.987]  Now Israel has this problem right now with Bibi and I've said it many times before.
[01:58:22.467 --> 01:58:26.109]  His father was one of my teachers at Cornell University.
[01:58:26.590 --> 01:58:28.891]  He was, I think, totally out of control.
[01:58:29.411 --> 01:58:32.793]  Bibi is a total narcissist, self-aggrandizing.
[01:58:32.833 --> 01:58:33.474]  He's kind of a
[01:58:33.994 --> 01:58:41.060]  Quasi-terrorist who's holding Israel hostage to his narcissism and the fact that he's fearful he's going to go to prison.
[01:58:41.421 --> 01:58:42.201]  Well, he's corrupt.
[01:58:42.341 --> 01:58:43.302]  His wife is corrupt.
[01:58:43.362 --> 01:58:44.724]  That's obvious.
[01:58:45.324 --> 01:58:55.093]  And Benny Getz, who is the far more serious candidate and is a general in the Israeli army, was the chief of the Israeli army, should have really been the leader.
[01:58:55.133 --> 01:58:59.797]  But Bibi is so self-centered that he realizes that only his
[01:59:01.218 --> 01:59:15.726]  Narcissism is what's key to the state of Israel and in fact the state of Israel really has to get rid of BB and continue to be what it was and and is a formidable high-tech company which produces an incredible amount.
[01:59:16.346 --> 01:59:19.788]  Why then do we see like the Rothschild economists everybody want BB out?
[01:59:19.808 --> 01:59:21.009]  I mean what's the fight going on there?
[01:59:23.576 --> 01:59:25.197]  I didn't know the Rothschilds want him out.
[01:59:25.237 --> 01:59:36.162]  I don't know very much about the Rothschilds per se, but basically the people who want him out is the fact that he is a corrupt individual and he doesn't want to face that.
[01:59:36.423 --> 01:59:38.624]  What about Ehud Barak hanging out with Epstein?
[01:59:39.304 --> 01:59:40.385]  Was he managing Honey Trap?
[01:59:41.466 --> 01:59:43.528]  Now we have a very interesting story.
[01:59:43.668 --> 01:59:48.473]  Ehud Barak was highly compromised and he had been in intelligence, he was in the military.
[01:59:48.894 --> 01:59:58.765]  And once again, when you are dealing with the Israeli Mossad and you're dealing with Maxwell, who was a Jewish immigrant from the Holocaust,
[01:59:59.245 --> 02:00:08.416]  And basically was one of the key elements in the Mossad working with Epstein as his daughter, Giselle McKenzie, who they can't find.
[02:00:08.517 --> 02:00:12.942]  I mean, in all of America, the woman who pimps for Epstein, you can't find her.
[02:00:12.982 --> 02:00:14.444]  That's an amazing phenomenon.
[02:00:14.924 --> 02:00:19.525]  That has the credibility of the fact that Epstein, you know, killed himself.
[02:00:19.585 --> 02:00:22.566]  So again, we have this issue of credibility.
[02:00:22.626 --> 02:00:25.406]  We have this issue of, you know, consequences.
[02:00:25.566 --> 02:00:27.647]  And we're not a country who follows through.
[02:00:28.187 --> 02:00:32.208]  And in a way, Israel is trying to follow through because they're saying, you know what?
[02:00:32.588 --> 02:00:34.448]  You're going to jail, Bibi, no matter what.
[02:00:34.588 --> 02:00:37.169]  You're going to end up in jail and we're going to throw you out.
[02:00:37.409 --> 02:00:44.590]  So eventually, I predict that Bibi is going to leave and Benny Gantz will take over and hopefully Israel can
[02:00:44.710 --> 02:00:46.612]  All right, let's take a phone call here.
[02:00:46.732 --> 02:00:47.993]  Sean in New Jersey.
[02:00:48.673 --> 02:00:49.774]  You've got a question for Machanik.
[02:00:49.794 --> 02:00:50.135]  Go ahead.
[02:00:51.916 --> 02:00:52.577]  Thank you, brother.
[02:00:52.617 --> 02:00:57.161]  I would like to say Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah and God bless the both of you, sir.
[02:00:57.341 --> 02:00:59.382]  I thank you so much for coming forward.
[02:00:59.422 --> 02:01:02.645]  You have no idea what it means to have us here from you.
[02:01:03.646 --> 02:01:05.307]  Go ahead and get your questions.
[02:01:06.408 --> 02:01:08.150]  Thanks, Sean.
[02:01:08.230 --> 02:01:13.014]  My question is, is there anything that we the people, the Oath Keepers,
[02:01:13.737 --> 02:01:25.763]  Former military, law enforcement, is there anything we can do to come together to show President Trump that no matter what, we're with him so he can start expediting his actions?
[02:01:25.823 --> 02:01:30.605]  Yeah, what do we do to get Trump to get tough and go after the deep state and not just put up with their crap?
[02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:33.051]  That's an excellent point.
[02:01:33.171 --> 02:01:42.920]  I think you should all get together within your own groups and start writing letters and, you know, sending Twitter or however you want to communicate to Trump that.
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:47.944]  We support him, but we need to have a tougher approach in the next administration.
[02:01:47.984 --> 02:01:50.406]  We have to start cleaning up the West.
[02:01:50.426 --> 02:01:53.569]  And by the way, he does listen to the people and a lot of it gets to him.
[02:01:53.609 --> 02:01:56.091]  So everybody, I mean, you have a chance with this president.
[02:01:56.131 --> 02:01:57.932]  He actually values what the general public says.
[02:01:57.972 --> 02:01:58.513]  That's a fact.
[02:01:59.113 --> 02:02:04.078]  And so absolutely, you gotta go bullhorn the White House, go to his events, stand in line, hand him a letter.
[02:02:04.098 --> 02:02:04.879]  It really works.
[02:02:05.660 --> 02:02:06.240]  It does work.
[02:02:06.301 --> 02:02:09.464]  And I think what Alex said to you is exactly correct.
[02:02:09.524 --> 02:02:16.311]  And I know people here in the South who do go to his rallies and they do attend and they do send in messages.
[02:02:16.771 --> 02:02:21.316]  But I think the Oath Keepers should get together and as an entity to really say, look,
[02:02:21.796 --> 02:02:23.257]  We want a tougher government.
[02:02:23.277 --> 02:02:24.657]  We want a smaller government.
[02:02:24.697 --> 02:02:25.818]  We're paying our taxes.
[02:02:25.838 --> 02:02:27.099]  We want fewer taxes.
[02:02:27.619 --> 02:02:30.000]  And we don't want as many people in the government.
[02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:31.360]  So let's start firing.
[02:02:31.501 --> 02:02:38.504]  And one of the things we do want is an infrastructure capacity where we're repairing our bridges and we're repairing our roads.
[02:02:38.524 --> 02:02:41.325]  He's been trying that and the Democrats have literally been blocking it.
[02:02:41.625 --> 02:02:42.325]  Thank you, Sean.
[02:02:42.445 --> 02:02:43.106]  Great question.
[02:02:43.606 --> 02:02:45.047]  Jeff's got a question in Texas.
[02:02:45.067 --> 02:02:47.348]  Jeff, you're on the air with Dr. Steve Pachinick of stevepachinick.com.
[02:02:47.368 --> 02:02:47.828]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:02:48.604 --> 02:02:51.129]  Hey, yeah, I just want to say I love listening when Dr. Paternick's on.
[02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:52.692]  I think he's the best guest you got, Alex.
[02:02:53.133 --> 02:03:00.207]  Anyway, if we get rid of the CIA like you were talking about, Dr. Paternick, what do we do in terms of
[02:03:01.098 --> 02:03:05.041]  Knowing what other nations are doing, since other nations are going to continue to spy on us.
[02:03:05.241 --> 02:03:20.110]  Wouldn't you just have a unified presidential and congressional directive of the mission, then have it through the five different military agencies, and then basically scale it back and then actually only act on real issues instead of trying to be a huge bureaucratic control arm and be snooping on everything?
[02:03:20.973 --> 02:03:22.493]  Well, you have a point.
[02:03:22.673 --> 02:03:24.414]  It's not just getting rid of the CIA.
[02:03:24.454 --> 02:03:28.395]  We have 16 different intelligence units that really don't work together.
[02:03:28.415 --> 02:03:32.516]  And then we have a 17th element, the DNI, that was created after 9-11.
[02:03:32.876 --> 02:03:33.557]  We don't need that.
[02:03:34.057 --> 02:03:39.258]  What I need is one integrated force which really brings it all together and uses human.
[02:03:39.398 --> 02:03:40.919]  We're not very good in human.
[02:03:41.019 --> 02:03:41.899]  I have to tell you that.
[02:03:42.559 --> 02:03:53.452]  Over the years after about the Reagan administration, we really did not concentrate on our ability to understand dynamics and possible outbreaks.
[02:03:57.176 --> 02:04:05.385]  The professionals, the corporate people, the doctors, everything was leveraged into HUMET against the Soviets and others, and we were dominant because our professionals were all doing stuff.
[02:04:05.726 --> 02:04:16.058]  Now, literally, the so-called intelligence class is a bunch of delusional, like you said, narcissists on power trips, imagining themselves like some fictitious James Bond character.
[02:04:16.098 --> 02:04:16.799]  It's ridiculous.
[02:04:17.759 --> 02:04:18.459]  I agree with you.
[02:04:18.939 --> 02:04:20.120]  Let me give you an example.
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:35.424]  The reason I was trained in both psychiatry and in politics was because Harold Laszlo, Lucien Pai and others at MIT and elsewhere, University of Chicago and Yale, had created a specialty called political psychology or political psychiatry.
[02:04:35.764 --> 02:04:37.364]  We need more of those people.
[02:04:37.625 --> 02:04:46.447]  And ironically, Yale University, which comes back and always criticizes the president, is the very source of that political psychology, but they don't even
[02:04:46.567 --> 02:04:47.267]  And let me stop you there.
[02:04:47.287 --> 02:04:49.368]  We may have to do two more segments if you can stay to get to all these calls.
[02:04:49.388 --> 02:04:50.248]  We've got to go, I understand.
[02:04:51.168 --> 02:04:59.010]  But just pulling back, so much of America's power is exporting our good ideas and then helping build infrastructure and really helping people.
[02:04:59.290 --> 02:05:03.531]  It's not acting tough and killing people and, you know, all of this stuff.
[02:05:03.611 --> 02:05:05.792]  It's actually promoting Americana.
[02:05:06.012 --> 02:05:11.213]  But if we lose that Americana and that pioneering spirit and don't export that, we're dead.
[02:05:11.293 --> 02:05:14.154]  It's our spirit that's dominant that we need to rekindle.
[02:05:15.225 --> 02:05:26.912]  Well, I agree with you, but I see that, again, I see it within the Christian fundamentalist community, and that's why when I saw the comment from one of Billy Graham's magazines, I knew that was not the Graham family.
[02:05:26.932 --> 02:05:31.415]  That's where I wanted to go next, because it was the Christian evangelicals that helped bring down the Soviet Union, as you know.
[02:05:32.115 --> 02:05:35.998]  When I was a kid, I watched them being leveraged in Dallas against the Soviet Union to great effect.
[02:05:36.018 --> 02:05:43.062]  I didn't know you were on the other end of that, but I saw that as a child growing up, and that's why the globalists fear Christians so much, is they know we'll kick their ass.
[02:05:44.366 --> 02:05:45.847]  Well, it's not only that.
[02:05:45.908 --> 02:05:49.451]  There is a real problem of Christianity being killed.
[02:05:49.791 --> 02:05:52.354]  There are over 2 million Christians who have been slaughtered.
[02:05:52.774 --> 02:05:55.277]  Chaldeans, Assyrians, Coptic.
[02:05:55.377 --> 02:06:03.725]  I go into Egypt, I remember years ago, and I would say to the Egyptian leaders, this is 10, 20 years ago, you've destroyed 10 Coptic
[02:06:04.389 --> 02:06:04.949]  Yeah.
[02:06:22.779 --> 02:06:23.259]  Stay right there.
[02:06:23.279 --> 02:06:26.461]  Let's come back and talk about that and this Christians Today attack that blew up.
[02:06:26.862 --> 02:06:27.582]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:06:27.642 --> 02:06:30.164]  Christians, even the UN admits, are the majority of persecuted groups.
[02:06:30.564 --> 02:06:33.306]  How do we get America to start defending Christians?
[02:06:33.606 --> 02:06:36.688]  That is so critical to the future of the whole planet, not just America.
[02:06:36.708 --> 02:06:38.389]  Hour number four is two minutes away.
[02:06:40.150 --> 02:06:43.032]  And we're doing two more segments and then Gerald Cilente, always informative.
[02:06:43.968 --> 02:06:44.849]  It's going to be taken over.
[02:06:44.869 --> 02:06:50.676]  We're going to go to Jack and Gene and Joe and Derek and Alex and David and Carlos and many others here in a moment.
[02:06:51.396 --> 02:06:59.385]  But getting back to the fact that it was missionaries and Christian groups in East Germany and the Soviet Union that helped bring that down.
[02:07:01.047 --> 02:07:03.609]  You're talking about the Christians, the majority of those being persecuted.
[02:07:04.370 --> 02:07:10.674]  Hollywood admits they're pissed at the Russians because they're becoming really Christian again and really promoting things that will have them be a good stable country.
[02:07:11.255 --> 02:07:19.181]  Why would the elite, so many of them, want to destroy fundamental Christian ethos that's made this country so successful?
[02:07:19.221 --> 02:07:19.381]  Why?
[02:07:21.107 --> 02:07:23.251]  First of all, they don't understand Christianity.
[02:07:23.391 --> 02:07:32.106]  Secondly, let me put a lot of the blame on many of the ministers whom I've talked to, including, and I will be very frank, I've talked to fundamentalists
[02:07:32.828 --> 02:07:41.713]  And I won't name who they are, across from Baptists to CMA, Christian Missionary Alliances, to different leaders within the Christian community.
[02:07:42.373 --> 02:07:46.195]  And what I hear is, oh, well, you know, we just talk about our sermons.
[02:07:46.475 --> 02:07:53.119]  And so I don't have a focal point for which I have been trying to proselytize to say for 20 years,
[02:07:54.159 --> 02:07:58.483]  It's Christianity that is being slaughtered all over the world.
[02:07:58.563 --> 02:08:00.924]  Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan.
[02:08:00.964 --> 02:08:02.986]  You want to send a missionary to Pakistan?
[02:08:03.266 --> 02:08:04.627]  Good luck.
[02:08:04.727 --> 02:08:08.530]  You want to send missionaries to different parts of Asia and China?
[02:08:08.791 --> 02:08:09.231]  Good luck.
[02:08:09.827 --> 02:08:17.992]  And what I'm trying to say, and I'm trying to convene all of these missionaries and these leaders of different groups into one group, but they don't want to do it.
[02:08:18.432 --> 02:08:21.814]  So part of it is our own problem within Christianity.
[02:08:21.934 --> 02:08:26.517]  Even as a Jew, I can say, look, I have a spirit of the Christianity.
[02:08:26.597 --> 02:08:36.523]  I understand what it takes to do this type of solidification within America to make it an export.
[02:08:37.003 --> 02:08:39.325]  China prosecutes Christians.
[02:08:40.553 --> 02:08:42.555]  Africa prosecutes Christians.
[02:08:42.996 --> 02:08:44.938]  The Muslim countries prosecute.
[02:08:45.018 --> 02:08:54.289]  Go to Saudi Arabia, to the great Mohammed bin Salman, who just did an IPO for $2 trillion, and ask the great Mohammed bin Salman, the prince, you know what?
[02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:57.133]  I want to set up a church near Mecca and Medina.
[02:08:57.553 --> 02:08:58.935]  Let's hear what he has to say.
[02:08:59.648 --> 02:09:04.149]  You can go to Iran and I can tell you that the Christians are treated well.
[02:09:04.509 --> 02:09:08.870]  Not incredibly well, but the Persians have no problems with the Christians.
[02:09:09.170 --> 02:09:10.331]  Go to Saudi Arabia.
[02:09:10.851 --> 02:09:13.071]  Go somewhere to Jordan and see what happens.
[02:09:13.432 --> 02:09:17.833]  Israel has to protect Christian sites because it's its Israeli boys who protect it.
[02:09:17.873 --> 02:09:21.133]  And go to Israel to see the beginnings of Christianity.
[02:09:21.253 --> 02:09:27.095]  But I have to lay fault with the different leaders with the different sects of Christianity here.
[02:09:27.335 --> 02:09:47.792]  They're ashamed of the faith, they bought into the whole ecumenical thing, and they don't get that Texas was founded by Christians that were sent in a decade before by the president at the time, and it's always been Christians expanding the West and building real civilizations at work, and all these other groups know it and go exterminate these people because the leadership
[02:09:48.052 --> 02:09:49.293]  Well, let me put it this way, so let's be fair.
[02:10:09.548 --> 02:10:10.529]  We have a problem.
[02:10:10.930 --> 02:10:13.253]  I've had a problem with the Catholicism.
[02:10:13.473 --> 02:10:14.975]  Not that I'm anti-Catholic.
[02:10:15.035 --> 02:10:20.563]  On the contrary, my aunt was a Catholic and I used to go to a church in Albion, Toulouse.
[02:10:21.104 --> 02:10:23.887]  But I have a real problem because Pope Francis
[02:10:24.628 --> 02:10:45.261]  Had been involved with the junta in Argentina in the 1970s and I had asked Vance to go down and either arrest him or deal with him as a terrorist because he worked with the junta in Argentina and allowed and supported the death of three to four of our nuns, American nuns, and two of our American Jesuit priests.
[02:10:45.621 --> 02:10:48.343]  From that point on, the church was already
[02:10:49.183 --> 02:10:50.224]  I think so.
[02:11:09.097 --> 02:11:12.519]  But the fundamentalist Christians can't get along with each other.
[02:11:12.919 --> 02:11:18.521]  There has to be an ecumenical council wherein, in America, they get together and understand it.
[02:11:18.941 --> 02:11:32.447]  One of the most powerful tools I had in the Soviet Union was not my ability to manipulate, it was my ability to insert Christianity through Pope John and the Greek Orthodox Church and the Russians.
[02:11:32.467 --> 02:11:33.348]  Stay there, back in 60 seconds.
[02:11:34.188 --> 02:11:35.048]  And who's in command?
[02:11:35.068 --> 02:11:37.689]  The American people and their will to not be slaves.
[02:11:37.749 --> 02:11:39.250]  And we're just a focal point of all that.
[02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:40.770]  Our Steve Pachinick is our guest.
[02:11:41.351 --> 02:11:42.271]  Got his new book out.
[02:11:42.331 --> 02:11:44.032]  Find out more details at stevepachinick.com.
[02:11:44.432 --> 02:11:45.452]  It'll come back during the new year.
[02:11:45.732 --> 02:11:47.153]  Let's run through a bunch of calls here.
[02:11:47.933 --> 02:11:48.413]  Here's one.
[02:11:48.433 --> 02:11:54.055]  He's a psychiatrist and we can't diagnose him in a FAR here, violate the... violate what is it?
[02:11:54.075 --> 02:11:55.235]  The Goldwater Rule.
[02:11:55.255 --> 02:11:58.056]  But Jack in Wisconsin, you got a question for Dr. Pachinick.
[02:11:58.076 --> 02:11:58.376]  Go ahead.
[02:11:58.396 --> 02:12:00.137]  Okay.
[02:12:02.058 --> 02:12:02.398]  Hey Jack.
[02:12:03.157 --> 02:12:05.639]  Hi, Dr. P. I got two questions for you.
[02:12:05.679 --> 02:12:14.906]  The first one is, last time you were on with Owen, you were on this great talk about how a majority of U.S.
[02:12:14.986 --> 02:12:17.808]  presidents were under one form of mind control or another.
[02:12:17.828 --> 02:12:22.932]  Do you believe President Trump is under any form of mind control?
[02:12:23.392 --> 02:12:24.513]  And if so, what type?
[02:12:25.450 --> 02:12:26.690]  No, no, no, no.
[02:12:26.710 --> 02:12:30.472]  What I said, basically, is that the presidents had different illnesses.
[02:12:30.612 --> 02:12:32.792]  John F. Kennedy had Asten's disease.
[02:12:33.713 --> 02:12:39.435]  A few of the others, Reagan had dementia, which was earlier than anybody thought.
[02:12:39.975 --> 02:12:42.636]  Trump is, quite frankly, quite healthy.
[02:12:42.756 --> 02:12:49.798]  And as a physician, I'm amazed that he can eat what he does, and ostensibly doesn't even exercise.
[02:12:49.818 --> 02:12:52.319]  He does have incredible genetics, and the family's known for those.
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:54.101]  Yeah, I understand.
[02:12:54.141 --> 02:12:55.602]  I mean, as a German loading.
[02:12:55.722 --> 02:13:02.467]  And also, what people don't understand, and he doesn't say much about it, his uncle was a famous MIT professor.
[02:13:03.107 --> 02:13:04.748]  And he never talks about him.
[02:13:05.169 --> 02:13:06.850]  And I'm just amazed.
[02:13:06.890 --> 02:13:08.751]  He's quite modest about his family.
[02:13:09.131 --> 02:13:09.872]  So the answer is no.
[02:13:09.892 --> 02:13:10.753]  What about the effects?
[02:13:10.893 --> 02:13:11.933]  I mean, I know that
[02:13:12.734 --> 02:13:23.159]  Roy Cohn was a bad guy and had some problems, but the whole House Un-American Activities Committee, the whole situation with McCarthy, who it turned out was right in many ways.
[02:13:23.559 --> 02:13:33.043]  I mean, Trump sat around in the middle of that as a young adult, and really the John Birch Society and all that, and really got a conspiratorial view, which is how things work.
[02:13:33.063 --> 02:13:35.064]  I think that really shaped Trump as well.
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:37.781]  Well, I think many things did.
[02:13:37.961 --> 02:13:45.525]  One of the things that, as a New Yorker, I understood about Trump, and I didn't know him personally, but we were very impressed, and I've said it a long time ago.
[02:13:46.169 --> 02:13:58.072]  When a man builds a skating rink for the city of New York for young kids because Koch couldn't do it in eight years and doesn't charge anything, that tells you a lot about his character.
[02:13:58.192 --> 02:13:59.412]  I don't care what he says.
[02:13:59.872 --> 02:14:01.973]  I don't care about his tweets.
[02:14:02.373 --> 02:14:08.114]  What I care about, what the American public has to understand, Democrats, Republicans are independent.
[02:14:09.176 --> 02:14:16.925]  You have to look at the outcome of what he's done, the Doral, the casinos, the condominiums.
[02:14:17.105 --> 02:14:19.208]  You do not create assets
[02:14:20.004 --> 02:14:25.428]  Which are viable and make a living and you cannot be ineffectual.
[02:14:25.728 --> 02:14:26.869]  It just doesn't happen.
[02:14:27.249 --> 02:14:29.851]  Mike Bloomberg has the same attitude.
[02:14:29.951 --> 02:14:32.853]  He created an asset which was very valuable.
[02:14:33.394 --> 02:14:35.615]  Maybe he's worth more or less than Trump.
[02:14:35.735 --> 02:14:36.836]  I don't particularly care.
[02:14:37.216 --> 02:14:42.880]  But among all of the candidates in the Democratic Party, you have another businessman there.
[02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:44.982]  You're saying you want new blood and things.
[02:14:45.002 --> 02:14:45.542]  We've got to jump.
[02:14:45.562 --> 02:14:46.023]  Good point.
[02:14:46.063 --> 02:14:47.864]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[02:14:49.768 --> 02:14:55.391]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Joe in Texas.
[02:14:55.411 --> 02:14:55.971]  Joe, go ahead.
[02:14:55.991 --> 02:14:58.332]  Hi, Alex.
[02:14:58.412 --> 02:14:59.253]  It's nice to talk to you.
[02:14:59.273 --> 02:15:02.234]  I want to say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and Dr. Pachink.
[02:15:02.254 --> 02:15:03.054]  You too.
[02:15:03.575 --> 02:15:05.316]  I didn't know a lot about politics before 2015.
[02:15:05.396 --> 02:15:11.679]  When Hillary said you was a dark heart, that legitimized you and everything, you know, what you're talking about.
[02:15:11.879 --> 02:15:13.980]  You know, I knew you.
[02:15:14.060 --> 02:15:15.801]  I did love it when Hillary called me dark heart.
[02:15:15.861 --> 02:15:16.781]  That's a good nickname.
[02:15:17.061 --> 02:15:18.522]  That had me like, I'm like, okay.
[02:15:19.133 --> 02:15:19.633]  That's the truth.
[02:15:19.853 --> 02:15:24.334]  She's the most evil woman to ever walk this planet with the rest of the Democrats.
[02:15:24.454 --> 02:15:26.235]  That's why I call her a pack of lying demons.
[02:15:28.155 --> 02:15:34.456]  I want to know what Dr. McCain thought about Q. I like Dr. McCain.
[02:15:36.177 --> 02:15:43.098]  He got more experience in life than I ever have, but I just want to ask him about the comment about Ilhan Omar that one time.
[02:15:43.798 --> 02:15:46.739]  I know you said she was right about talking about Israel, but
[02:15:47.398 --> 02:15:47.918]  Absolutely.
[02:15:47.958 --> 02:15:48.539]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:15:48.579 --> 02:15:49.079]  Great question.
[02:15:49.099 --> 02:15:49.920]  Sorry, I've got to move quick.
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:54.703]  Yeah, I mean, the whole Q thing, I mean, I don't want to poo-poo folks that like that and everything.
[02:15:55.363 --> 02:15:58.746]  It's just that we'll talk about things that are confirmed and real.
[02:15:58.766 --> 02:16:01.748]  They're like, oh, well, then if it's like something on 4chan, it must be.
[02:16:02.268 --> 02:16:03.429]  What's your view on that, Doc?
[02:16:04.301 --> 02:16:09.164]  Well, you know, again, ironically, I don't have a conspiratorial mind.
[02:16:09.224 --> 02:16:11.366]  I mean, I believe in what I know and what are facts.
[02:16:11.426 --> 02:16:13.187]  When I went on your show, it was simple.
[02:16:13.387 --> 02:16:15.529]  You understood what 9-11 was about.
[02:16:15.869 --> 02:16:18.151]  From that day on, we've never really deviated.
[02:16:18.171 --> 02:16:19.471]  We may have some differences.
[02:16:19.972 --> 02:16:21.133]  I don't know what Q is.
[02:16:21.153 --> 02:16:22.654]  I have an idea of what it is.
[02:16:22.714 --> 02:16:27.057]  But again, you have to understand, in the world of intelligence, forget the CIA,
[02:16:28.104 --> 02:16:29.425]  We play everything.
[02:16:29.825 --> 02:16:36.591]  We play it as dialectics, meaning we take one side and then we take the other and we play it together at the same time.
[02:16:37.051 --> 02:16:46.218]  So you don't know whether Q is a product of any one of the 16 or 17 intelligence app organizations or whatever it is that we do in games.
[02:16:46.258 --> 02:16:53.303]  Because it's anonymous, it's perfect for cutouts and countergroups and it just, you know, becomes like jumping into black water.
[02:16:53.343 --> 02:16:54.084]  You don't know what's in there.
[02:16:54.324 --> 02:16:54.544]  Correct.
[02:16:54.764 --> 02:16:55.785]  That's exactly right.
[02:16:55.985 --> 02:16:57.767]  And that's a good analogy.
[02:16:57.787 --> 02:17:01.850]  But on this show, it's like 35,000 foot view, crystal clear, mountaintop air.
[02:17:02.650 --> 02:17:04.031]  We're very straight up about everything.
[02:17:04.772 --> 02:17:15.320]  Well, InfoWars has been around a long time, and it's very rare when you have a man like Alex Jones who can predict four months or six months before 9-11 that we were going to have 9-11.
[02:17:15.480 --> 02:17:18.583]  And when I heard that, I said, God bless this individual.
[02:17:18.723 --> 02:17:19.823]  I'm going to get to know him.
[02:17:19.884 --> 02:17:20.564]  And that was it.
[02:17:20.684 --> 02:17:21.765]  It's as simple as that.
[02:17:21.825 --> 02:17:23.086]  It's not that complicated.
[02:17:23.166 --> 02:17:23.326]  I bet.
[02:17:23.346 --> 02:17:24.187]  It wasn't that complicated.
[02:17:24.207 --> 02:17:25.307]  They were priming us for it.
[02:17:25.347 --> 02:17:27.848]  You know, when the big buildings blow up, we take your rights.
[02:17:27.868 --> 02:17:29.549]  I mean, it was all just, they had it all lined up.
[02:17:29.569 --> 02:17:30.070]  You could see it.
[02:17:30.450 --> 02:17:30.670]  All right.
[02:17:30.690 --> 02:17:31.690]  Thank you so much, caller.
[02:17:31.890 --> 02:17:33.111]  I can't get to all these.
[02:17:33.131 --> 02:17:34.232]  That's why I said only take six calls.
[02:17:34.332 --> 02:17:34.912]  You're all great.
[02:17:35.252 --> 02:17:36.193]  But Pchenik's got to go.
[02:17:36.213 --> 02:17:37.153]  We got other guests coming up.
[02:17:38.194 --> 02:17:44.297]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Texas has a question.
[02:17:44.317 --> 02:17:44.797]  Go ahead, Steve.
[02:17:46.038 --> 02:17:46.918]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[02:17:46.938 --> 02:17:47.518]  Good to see you.
[02:17:47.538 --> 02:17:49.079]  I consider you an awesome legend.
[02:17:49.099 --> 02:17:50.460]  We're out there with Stevie Ray Vaughan.
[02:17:51.138 --> 02:17:52.119]  Well, we love you too, brother.
[02:17:52.319 --> 02:17:53.120]  I see your question.
[02:17:53.140 --> 02:17:54.741]  Should we take on some dim strategies?
[02:17:55.242 --> 02:17:56.543]  I mean, specify that.
[02:17:56.943 --> 02:17:58.164]  Yeah, so let me elaborate on that.
[02:17:58.264 --> 02:18:06.251]  So I see that the Democrats have obviously made a push to persuade our black Americans or Latino Americans or Asian Americans that they are the party for them.
[02:18:06.291 --> 02:18:14.078]  And I don't hear enough Republicans, conservatives, libertarians talking about how, especially with the demographic change, this is going to be a serious win for us if we tell them about
[02:18:15.139 --> 02:18:21.163]  Well, I mean, I try to do that, but I mean, the media, I don't know how to make things racially based.
[02:18:21.223 --> 02:18:26.827]  I'm like Martin Luther King and then I'm a junior that I think just should be the ideas and, you know, I'm not going to say, hey, it's for a black person.
[02:18:26.847 --> 02:18:27.688]  It's good for you too.
[02:18:27.708 --> 02:18:31.851]  Uh, you know, the left, that's really what's racist to me is making everything about what color you are.
[02:18:32.211 --> 02:18:37.335]  But, but, but I mean, obviously the Democratic Party want domesticated enslaved people that they can control and dumb down.
[02:18:37.835 --> 02:18:39.236]  And I think we should talk more about that.
[02:18:39.597 --> 02:18:40.638]  A great question, Steve.
[02:18:41.178 --> 02:18:42.459]  Dr. Pacino, can you comment on that?
[02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:43.580]  Sure.
[02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:45.101]  I happen to be Hispanic.
[02:18:45.141 --> 02:18:49.783]  When you're born in Cuba and you grow up and you speak Spanish and that's your native language, that's Hispanic.
[02:18:49.883 --> 02:18:57.166]  So I assume, like many others, that America will be, it's good for everyone.
[02:18:57.666 --> 02:19:04.869]  And contrary to the Democrats or anybody else who tries to fractionalize us or put us into categories, it doesn't work.
[02:19:05.450 --> 02:19:08.611]  What works is the opportunity to make mistakes here.
[02:19:08.852 --> 02:19:10.632]  Not just success, but mistakes.
[02:19:11.032 --> 02:19:17.155]  There's no other country where I can make mistakes, and as many as I have, and come back and be successful.
[02:19:17.435 --> 02:19:21.117]  Whether you're black, Hispanic, Asian, Hindu, it doesn't really matter.
[02:19:21.137 --> 02:19:27.720]  That's really our power, is it is the experiment, it is the Wild Wild West, and let's admit, we're the crazy diverse pirates we've always been, and embrace it.
[02:19:28.567 --> 02:19:30.268]  And that's basically, I agree.
[02:19:30.768 --> 02:19:34.290]  I don't think we have to be all that sane and we don't have to be all that... I mean, of course we're violent!
[02:19:34.350 --> 02:19:35.270]  Of course we're crazy!
[02:19:35.290 --> 02:19:36.491]  Everybody wants to come here!
[02:19:36.571 --> 02:19:37.271]  That's who we are!
[02:19:37.311 --> 02:19:37.991]  Let's embrace it!
[02:19:38.071 --> 02:19:38.832]  We're maniacs!
[02:19:39.929 --> 02:19:41.090]  Well, I would agree with that.
[02:19:41.310 --> 02:19:45.334]  I would agree we're rational maniacs who basically don't mess with us.
[02:19:45.815 --> 02:19:51.820]  We're going to come in and if you think we're weak or something is happening like China does, think again.
[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:55.884]  Because the Japanese made that mistake, the Germans made that mistake.
[02:19:56.264 --> 02:20:02.010]  Many countries make the mistake that because we're compliant, we're nice, that we cannot be ruthless.
[02:20:02.490 --> 02:20:06.711]  I will refer you back to the Civil War by Abraham Lincoln.
[02:20:06.791 --> 02:20:09.932]  It was not civil, and it was an auto genocide.
[02:20:10.453 --> 02:20:17.395]  And the South was beaten for reasons that had nothing to do with slavery, but had to do with commerce, business.
[02:20:17.695 --> 02:20:18.355]  That's right.
[02:20:18.415 --> 02:20:22.577]  It was about the urban controlling the rural, just like is happening again.
[02:20:22.877 --> 02:20:24.957]  We really appreciate you coming back in the new year.
[02:20:25.237 --> 02:20:26.078]  Have a great Christmas.
[02:20:26.118 --> 02:20:27.358]  God bless you, Dr. Pchenik.
[02:20:27.538 --> 02:20:28.999]  God bless and Happy New Year.
[02:20:30.779 --> 02:20:33.720]  I'm sorry to David, Alex, Derek, Gene, and Carlos.
[02:20:33.740 --> 02:20:35.321]  That's why I told them, only take five, six calls.
[02:20:35.721 --> 02:20:36.601]  They put you all on the board.
[02:20:36.681 --> 02:20:37.141]  I'm sorry.
[02:20:37.181 --> 02:20:37.641]  Great crew.
[02:20:37.741 --> 02:20:39.222]  I try to get to everybody now.
[02:20:39.262 --> 02:20:40.522]  I'm doing a better job, but we're out of time.
[02:20:40.942 --> 02:20:43.283]  Please don't forget, you can still get Christmas for Yourself.
[02:20:43.323 --> 02:20:43.923]  Great products.
[02:20:44.383 --> 02:20:45.384]  Some of the best sales of the year.
[02:20:45.444 --> 02:20:46.364]  Double patriot points.
[02:20:46.664 --> 02:20:47.204]  Free shipping.
[02:20:47.264 --> 02:20:48.425]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:20:48.685 --> 02:20:54.767]  Last chance to get the Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself shirt and others at Infowarstore.com.
[02:20:55.027 --> 02:20:58.368]  And coming up, Gerald Salente from Kingston, New York.
[02:20:59.008 --> 02:20:59.908]  Hey, hey, hey!
[02:21:00.149 --> 02:21:03.590]  Thank you for having me on the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:21:03.610 --> 02:21:05.411]  And what are we?
[02:21:05.491 --> 02:21:06.771]  Two days before Christmas.
[02:21:06.951 --> 02:21:09.192]  I want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas.
[02:21:09.252 --> 02:21:10.153]  Buon Natale.
[02:21:11.233 --> 02:21:13.774]  And also a time to celebrate.
[02:21:14.934 --> 02:21:17.175]  Celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace.
[02:21:19.116 --> 02:21:24.758]  And as founder of Occupy Peace, the Prince of Peace is my kind of guy.
[02:21:25.579 --> 02:21:26.379]  Peace on Earth.
[02:21:27.740 --> 02:21:28.620]  Goodwill to men.
[02:21:29.918 --> 02:21:32.739]  And we need peace on earth.
[02:21:34.779 --> 02:21:35.219]  Murder.
[02:21:36.719 --> 02:21:37.220]  Violence.
[02:21:38.380 --> 02:21:39.000]  Corruption.
[02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:40.620]  Misery.
[02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:42.401]  Poverty.
[02:21:43.801 --> 02:21:44.421]  Wars.
[02:21:45.521 --> 02:21:46.201]  Protests.
[02:21:47.882 --> 02:21:48.382]  Riots.
[02:21:50.162 --> 02:21:50.722]  Strikes.
[02:21:54.283 --> 02:21:55.763]  I've been at this for 40 years.
[02:21:55.783 --> 02:21:58.284]  2020 will be my 40th year.
[02:21:58.584 --> 02:21:59.604]  Take a look around the world.
[02:22:00.723 --> 02:22:01.584]  Afghanistan.
[02:22:02.444 --> 02:22:02.865]  Iraq.
[02:22:04.026 --> 02:22:04.486]  Iran.
[02:22:05.227 --> 02:22:05.727]  Syria.
[02:22:06.367 --> 02:22:06.748]  Yemen.
[02:22:08.009 --> 02:22:08.449]  Libya.
[02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.910]  Algeria.
[02:22:11.832 --> 02:22:12.452]  Sudan.
[02:22:13.293 --> 02:22:13.793]  Mali.
[02:22:14.414 --> 02:22:14.954]  Niger.
[02:22:15.415 --> 02:22:15.855]  Guinea.
[02:22:16.435 --> 02:22:17.076]  Cameroon.
[02:22:17.456 --> 02:22:18.277]  South Africa.
[02:22:18.297 --> 02:22:20.118]  Oh, let's see.
[02:22:20.499 --> 02:22:21.459]  Oh, Zimbabwe.
[02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:24.382]  Oh, forgot about Hong Kong.
[02:22:25.442 --> 02:22:26.003]  Yeah.
[02:22:26.763 --> 02:22:27.864]  Oh, Chile.
[02:22:29.065 --> 02:22:29.526]  Colombia.
[02:22:29.586 --> 02:22:29.866]  Peru.
[02:22:30.538 --> 02:22:31.058]  Bolivia.
[02:22:31.959 --> 02:22:32.719]  Venezuela.
[02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:35.981]  Look what's going on around the world.
[02:22:38.363 --> 02:22:38.783]  War.
[02:22:41.365 --> 02:22:42.265]  Demonstrations.
[02:22:44.246 --> 02:22:44.927]  Protests.
[02:22:47.609 --> 02:22:49.170]  Never seen again anything like this.
[02:22:51.811 --> 02:22:59.316]  I will not die in murderous wars started by murderous leaders
[02:23:01.010 --> 02:23:02.731]  of murderous political gangs.
[02:23:02.891 --> 02:23:04.152]  Will you or your children?
[02:23:06.313 --> 02:23:11.696]  As the founder of Occupy Peace, I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[02:23:12.596 --> 02:23:13.597]  It's Christmas time.
[02:23:15.137 --> 02:23:18.119]  Celebrating the birth of the Prince of Peace.
[02:23:18.999 --> 02:23:20.440]  As I said, my kind of guy.
[02:23:22.581 --> 02:23:24.042]  Let's give peace a chance.
[02:23:25.443 --> 02:23:30.025]  Please, consider giving a Christmas gift
[02:23:31.454 --> 02:23:31.934]  Of peace.
[02:23:32.775 --> 02:23:33.775]  To occupy peace.
[02:23:34.775 --> 02:23:40.938]  Because, united in peace, we will defeat evil.
[02:23:43.499 --> 02:23:46.961]  So, my trip is to occupy peace.
[02:23:47.961 --> 02:23:48.621]  Is it yours?
[02:23:49.041 --> 02:23:50.362]  If so, please join me.
[02:23:51.102 --> 02:23:55.164]  I was just thinking, where are all the religions right now?
[02:23:56.004 --> 02:23:57.445]  I don't care whatever one you believe in.
[02:23:59.190 --> 02:24:05.933]  We're all the leaders of those religions saying we need peace on earth.
[02:24:07.194 --> 02:24:12.336]  We are not going to evolve to a higher level if we live in fear and terror.
[02:24:13.797 --> 02:24:22.541]  And I don't want you got I don't these people that say, well, you know, we need another war.
[02:24:22.601 --> 02:24:24.362]  We could do this and we could save it.
[02:24:24.422 --> 02:24:25.542]  Don't want to hear it.
[02:24:26.403 --> 02:24:27.263]  Just for the record.
[02:24:28.251 --> 02:24:31.153]  America hasn't won a war since World War II.
[02:24:33.094 --> 02:24:35.496]  And they won World War II with the help of the Russians.
[02:24:35.656 --> 02:24:46.642]  Now that we've learned to hate so much because of the Democrats putting out all that propaganda as to why Hillary Clinton lost against Donald Trump.
[02:24:47.923 --> 02:24:50.725]  Well, clearly she lost because people couldn't stand her.
[02:24:51.766 --> 02:24:57.309]  And when you look at her unpopularity rating prior to the election,
[02:24:59.008 --> 02:25:01.349]  In 2016, it couldn't have been clearer.
[02:25:01.769 --> 02:25:05.391]  But yet, they've taught us how to hate the Russians.
[02:25:07.072 --> 02:25:12.355]  And now Trump just signed the biggest military bill in our history.
[02:25:14.196 --> 02:25:21.840]  And only 48 people in the House of Representatives voted against it.
[02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:23.241]  48 people.
[02:25:26.138 --> 02:25:27.819]  Those liberal demo-craps, huh?
[02:25:28.199 --> 02:25:29.579]  Yeah, forget about it.
[02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:32.641]  I don't want my money going to war.
[02:25:33.841 --> 02:25:35.022]  I want it going to peace.
[02:25:36.542 --> 02:25:38.683]  This whole thing about the impeachment.
[02:25:39.924 --> 02:25:50.408]  Ah, Trump was holding back $400 million in military aid for the Ukrainians so they could keep the war going against the Russians.
[02:25:52.369 --> 02:25:53.950]  I don't want my money going there.
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:58.821]  I work very hard and so does everybody listening to make a buck.
[02:26:00.201 --> 02:26:05.022]  I don't want them stealing my money to give it to the military-industrial complex.
[02:26:05.963 --> 02:26:06.923]  And the facts are there.
[02:26:06.943 --> 02:26:14.565]  Defense stocks could soar again in 2020 after massive defense spending.
[02:26:15.605 --> 02:26:16.805]  Oh, you know where this is coming from?
[02:26:18.206 --> 02:26:19.166]  CNBC.
[02:26:19.686 --> 02:26:21.246]  Not the World Socialist website.
[02:26:24.502 --> 02:26:27.703]  Geopolitical uncertainty coupled with a colossal uptick in U.S.
[02:26:27.743 --> 02:26:33.085]  military spending could make defense stocks a winning trade once again in 2020.
[02:26:34.225 --> 02:26:39.847]  Under the Trump administration, the space has left the broader stock market in the dust.
[02:26:40.707 --> 02:26:42.908]  The iShares, U.S.
[02:26:43.048 --> 02:26:53.071]  aerospace and defense exchange-traded funds, ITA, has rallied more than 70 percent since Trump
[02:26:54.141 --> 02:26:55.742]  won the election back in 2016.
[02:26:55.802 --> 02:27:04.069]  The S&P 500, meanwhile, is up 50% from that time.
[02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:07.091]  This year has been no different.
[02:27:07.532 --> 02:27:11.695]  The ITA ETFs have surged more than 30% in 2019, while the S&P 500 has gained 27%.
[02:27:11.835 --> 02:27:13.756]  Also, a historic boost to U.S.
[02:27:13.776 --> 02:27:15.178]  defense budget should be a boom
[02:27:23.766 --> 02:27:25.367]  For the defense stocks in 2020.
[02:27:25.847 --> 02:27:27.567]  The article goes on and on and on.
[02:27:28.628 --> 02:27:31.368]  So, this is where your money's going.
[02:27:31.989 --> 02:27:34.789]  Not going to build an hour-rodded infrastructure.
[02:27:35.250 --> 02:27:37.250]  Not going to create jobs.
[02:27:37.950 --> 02:27:40.351]  Going to the military-industrial complex.
[02:27:40.411 --> 02:27:41.251]  Not my trip.
[02:27:41.852 --> 02:27:47.493]  And again, anybody that wants to go to war, any leader out there, lead the charge.
[02:27:48.254 --> 02:27:48.854]  That's right.
[02:27:49.614 --> 02:27:52.655]  Get dressed up in your uniform and lead the charge.
[02:27:53.379 --> 02:27:57.081]  And send your kids, send your wife, and send your money.
[02:27:57.101 --> 02:27:58.822]  Ain't my trip.
[02:27:59.723 --> 02:28:00.823]  I am an American.
[02:28:00.843 --> 02:28:11.890]  I am a believer of the real men who brought us liberty, love, and freedom like the founding fathers.
[02:28:12.851 --> 02:28:14.772]  And you go back to George Washington.
[02:28:14.832 --> 02:28:16.973]  Hey, Christmas Eve is tomorrow.
[02:28:17.994 --> 02:28:21.876]  I guess Sir Washington wasn't spending Christmas Eve under the Christmas tree.
[02:28:22.714 --> 02:28:24.015]  With gifts for his family.
[02:28:24.455 --> 02:28:29.438]  No, Washington was crossing the Delaware to fight for freedom.
[02:28:30.599 --> 02:28:32.100]  And what's his farewell address?
[02:28:34.061 --> 02:28:37.443]  No foreign entanglements.
[02:28:38.283 --> 02:28:38.844]  Got it?
[02:28:41.185 --> 02:28:44.507]  Look what just came out with the Afghanistan papers.
[02:28:45.708 --> 02:28:51.191]  Totally, totally shut down by the mainstream media.
[02:28:52.915 --> 02:28:54.355]  Don't even see it.
[02:28:55.976 --> 02:28:57.636]  They were out and they're gone.
[02:28:58.716 --> 02:29:00.297]  How they lied to us.
[02:29:02.377 --> 02:29:06.819]  How they lied to us about what was going on in Afghanistan.
[02:29:08.559 --> 02:29:09.699]  It's a time for truth.
[02:29:10.420 --> 02:29:11.340]  It's Christmas time.
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:15.281]  The Prince of Peace, my kind of guy.
[02:29:15.821 --> 02:29:16.921]  We'll be back in just a few.
[02:29:19.162 --> 02:29:19.882]  Hello, hello, hello.
[02:29:20.748 --> 02:29:33.055]  Rating on the Alex Jones Show, remember, extended the 12 Days of Christmas Super Sale at InfoWarsStores.com, free shipping, double patriot points.
[02:29:34.356 --> 02:29:43.481]  As the globalists make their desperate last stand against InfoWars and the Liberty Movement, we need your support now more than ever.
[02:29:44.461 --> 02:29:49.544]  So InfoWars is extending the 12 Days of Christmas Sale until they run out.
[02:29:50.532 --> 02:29:53.473]  Some products may not make it into the new year.
[02:29:54.113 --> 02:29:59.535]  So make sure you get yours before it's too late.
[02:29:59.555 --> 02:30:13.559]  12 day specials include 60% off Brain Force Plus, 30% off Super Blue Singles, and 50% off Super Blue Combo Packs, 60% off Knockout, on and on and on.
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:15.300]  Great deals here.
[02:30:15.400 --> 02:30:18.801]  And remember, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:30:20.390 --> 02:30:21.571]  Let freedom ring.
[02:30:22.191 --> 02:30:27.314]  And you know, one of our top trends for 2019 was censorship 2019.
[02:30:28.374 --> 02:30:31.716]  And boy, do we have it.
[02:30:32.356 --> 02:30:34.077]  And it's only going to get worse.
[02:30:34.898 --> 02:30:44.783]  You know, I was talking before about the Afghan war, the longest war in American history, and how they've lied to us about this war.
[02:30:46.431 --> 02:30:50.534]  The facts are there in the Pentagon, or excuse me, the Pentagon Papers.
[02:30:50.574 --> 02:30:52.056]  Yeah, the other Pentagon Papers.
[02:30:52.576 --> 02:30:54.297]  The Afghanistan Papers.
[02:30:55.038 --> 02:31:00.502]  They just had an election in Afghanistan.
[02:31:01.383 --> 02:31:02.604]  You know when the election was over?
[02:31:05.506 --> 02:31:06.327]  Let's see.
[02:31:07.768 --> 02:31:08.389]  September.
[02:31:09.189 --> 02:31:09.670]  That's right.
[02:31:12.092 --> 02:31:12.652]  September.
[02:31:14.314 --> 02:31:15.775]  You know when they finished counting the votes?
[02:31:18.899 --> 02:31:19.919]  A couple of days ago.
[02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:26.462]  Afghanistan struggles to declare a winner in disputed September vote.
[02:31:29.603 --> 02:31:33.305]  So the guy who's been running the show for five years, he's back.
[02:31:36.266 --> 02:31:38.527]  They had a very, very low turnout.
[02:31:39.147 --> 02:31:41.408]  The turnout was a historic low.
[02:31:42.648 --> 02:31:47.150]  As about a third of the country's polling centers did not open.
[02:31:49.932 --> 02:31:53.313]  A country of 35 million people?
[02:31:54.933 --> 02:31:57.514]  First they said 2.2 million people voted.
[02:31:57.534 --> 02:32:10.937]  And then, without giving them another reason why, they said, well, only 1.8 million voted.
[02:32:10.957 --> 02:32:11.637]  1.8 million.
[02:32:12.838 --> 02:32:17.259]  That's like almost as bad as the stupid Democrat debates.
[02:32:18.643 --> 02:32:22.305]  That they had last week.
[02:32:22.325 --> 02:32:23.266]  8.2 million people.
[02:32:25.067 --> 02:32:36.994]  8.2 million people from a voting age in this country of 275 million people.
[02:32:39.015 --> 02:32:41.356]  So our elections are as worthless as theirs.
[02:32:42.577 --> 02:32:47.780]  And again, what this I mentioned about the military-industrial complex.
[02:32:48.899 --> 02:32:53.440]  And with all this moronic talk about impeachment, what was it about?
[02:32:54.161 --> 02:33:13.807]  Trump holding back 400 million bucks of our money so he could find out the dirt on Biden's son and how the boy got that money along with John Kerry's stepson-in-law's partner for Burisma Energy, and they know nothing about energy, never been to Ukraine, and don't speak the lingo.
[02:33:15.868 --> 02:33:16.048]  So.
[02:33:18.049 --> 02:33:29.437]  What I'm saying here is, the people have no clue what's going on, they're lying about this war, and they're wasting our money while we need to rebuild America.
[02:33:32.439 --> 02:33:40.105]  So, do what you can to support InfoWars, so we can give peace a chance, and of course occupied peace.
[02:33:40.125 --> 02:33:45.429]  I just want to stay on this, Afghan papers, Afghanistan papers,
[02:33:46.121 --> 02:33:46.481]  U.S.
[02:33:46.521 --> 02:33:49.743]  denies public was lied about Afghanistan.
[02:33:51.463 --> 02:33:55.425]  And this is from the Defense Secretary, Mark Esper.
[02:34:00.107 --> 02:34:07.931]  Between all the folks looking at this conflict over the years, some type of insinuation
[02:34:08.524 --> 02:34:13.306]  That there's been large-scale conspiracy is just, to me, ridiculous.
[02:34:14.266 --> 02:34:19.709]  Hey, Junior, maybe to you it's ridiculous, not to me.
[02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:34.235]  I know how to read, and I read what they said in that 400 pages of generals, of colonels, of sergeants,
[02:34:35.546 --> 02:34:39.747]  And many, many other people saying how they lied to us.
[02:34:40.187 --> 02:34:45.749]  So maybe ridiculous to you, but keep it to yourself, Junior.
[02:34:46.209 --> 02:34:50.170]  Don't try to shove it on me, boy.
[02:34:50.190 --> 02:35:00.994]  I know there's an assertion out there of some sort of coordinated lie over the course of 18 years.
[02:35:03.246 --> 02:35:05.729]  I find that a mischaracterization!
[02:35:06.790 --> 02:35:13.357]  And that's according to... General Mark Millery!
[02:35:13.377 --> 02:35:16.500]  Hey General!
[02:35:17.482 --> 02:35:18.703]  Say the Jack!
[02:35:20.244 --> 02:35:20.385]  Hey!
[02:35:21.297 --> 02:35:22.777]  You can't win a war.
[02:35:22.797 --> 02:35:25.078]  You guys haven't won the war.
[02:35:25.458 --> 02:35:29.360]  Killed over a couple of hundred thousand of them maybe.
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:30.740]  Destroyed the country.
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:32.320]  Cost us trillions of dollars.
[02:35:32.681 --> 02:35:33.561]  And how many U.S.
[02:35:33.621 --> 02:35:35.301]  soldiers are dead because of this?
[02:35:35.902 --> 02:35:36.542]  General?
[02:35:38.102 --> 02:35:38.522]  Got it.
[02:35:39.923 --> 02:35:41.723]  Not a mischaracterization.
[02:35:42.123 --> 02:35:46.905]  You are the character that's missing it, man.
[02:35:50.367 --> 02:35:51.388]  What else do we have here?
[02:35:51.408 --> 02:35:59.655]  And those were honest assessments, and they were never intended to deceive either the Congress or the American people.
[02:36:00.115 --> 02:36:01.516]  They're lies, man.
[02:36:01.536 --> 02:36:03.958]  They're lies, and you guys is liars.
[02:36:04.559 --> 02:36:11.125]  Covering up the losing war that you can't win, going on 19 years.
[02:36:11.425 --> 02:36:13.827]  Hey, General, could you count that high?
[02:36:15.619 --> 02:36:16.800]  I am an American!
[02:36:17.261 --> 02:36:34.113]  I am not a traitor like all you people that are traitors against General Washington, the first President of the United States, a real fighting man, who warned us of no foreign entanglements.
[02:36:36.455 --> 02:36:37.516]  Let's see over here.
[02:36:37.536 --> 02:36:38.336]  What else do we have?
[02:36:38.356 --> 02:36:40.017]  U.S.
[02:36:40.077 --> 02:36:44.561]  newspaper, The Post, sent the documents which it called the Afghanistan Papers.
[02:36:45.925 --> 02:36:49.728]  Contradicted, quote, a chorus of public statements from U.S.
[02:36:49.828 --> 02:36:55.132]  presidents, military commanders, and dip-low-mats.
[02:36:55.472 --> 02:36:56.733]  And that's what they are, man.
[02:36:57.114 --> 02:37:03.158]  They dip real low on that mat, bend over, and you know what else.
[02:37:03.579 --> 02:37:06.221]  Those are our dip-low-mats.
[02:37:07.101 --> 02:37:15.508]  Well, diplomats who assured Americans year after year that they were making progress in Afghanistan
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:19.301]  And the war was worth fighting.
[02:37:24.462 --> 02:37:28.283]  And you know what this General Millery said?
[02:37:33.204 --> 02:37:35.404]  That these documents were backwards looking.
[02:37:39.565 --> 02:37:40.265]  And that U.S.
[02:37:40.305 --> 02:37:43.446]  troops have been successful in ruining out Al Qaeda.
[02:37:44.318 --> 02:37:46.460]  And punishing their protectors, the Taliban.
[02:37:46.820 --> 02:37:50.143]  Hey, the Taliban were not their protectors.
[02:37:50.523 --> 02:37:53.486]  I wrote about this as it was happening in our Trends Journal.
[02:37:56.689 --> 02:38:00.852]  They asked for proof that Osama bin Laden had anything to do with this.
[02:38:01.473 --> 02:38:02.614]  Bush wouldn't give it to them.
[02:38:05.637 --> 02:38:08.339]  Hey, they got bin Laden, how come the war's still going on?
[02:38:11.747 --> 02:38:14.868]  It's a losing war, losing money, immoral.
[02:38:15.488 --> 02:38:17.048]  It's Christmas time.
[02:38:18.268 --> 02:38:21.869]  Time to celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace.
[02:38:22.289 --> 02:38:24.470]  Hey, General, could you add that up?
[02:38:24.870 --> 02:38:25.710]  Prince of Peace.
[02:38:25.810 --> 02:38:26.550]  Capisce?
[02:38:27.310 --> 02:38:29.471]  We're going to be back in just a few.
[02:38:30.551 --> 02:38:32.511]  We wish you a Merry Christmas.
[02:38:32.671 --> 02:38:34.512]  We wish you a Merry Christmas.
[02:38:35.072 --> 02:38:39.993]  Wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year and a year ahead.
[02:38:41.567 --> 02:38:44.389]  We're in for a wild ride into the future.
[02:38:45.130 --> 02:38:49.294]  Just came out with our 2020 Top Trends.
[02:38:50.134 --> 02:38:53.737]  I hit some of them on InfoWars, and I'm going to give you some more today.
[02:38:53.757 --> 02:38:58.421]  Of course, the first one is Election 2020.
[02:38:59.042 --> 02:39:00.363]  Trump by default.
[02:39:01.164 --> 02:39:02.485]  The fault are the Democrats.
[02:39:03.246 --> 02:39:05.648]  They got nobody that could run against them that's going to beat them.
[02:39:07.549 --> 02:39:09.231]  Again, it's about to swing states.
[02:39:10.809 --> 02:39:18.894]  And Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren ain't going to swing in the swing states.
[02:39:19.035 --> 02:39:20.516]  I mean, ain't going to happen.
[02:39:21.196 --> 02:39:30.962]  And Biden, this impeachment thing is really going to hurt him as more and more dirt comes out if he's the cat that's going to be running against Trump.
[02:39:31.583 --> 02:39:36.566]  About all the dirty deals that the Biden did to his boys.
[02:39:37.287 --> 02:39:37.927]  That's right.
[02:39:38.768 --> 02:39:39.308]  The Hunter.
[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:44.042]  They're hunting for free jobs and free money because daddy got the inside deal.
[02:39:44.883 --> 02:39:45.863]  Plus, plus, plus.
[02:39:45.903 --> 02:39:47.604]  So I think, not going to beat them.
[02:39:48.085 --> 02:39:50.166]  And what's that guy?
[02:39:50.226 --> 02:39:51.026]  Bloomberg?
[02:39:51.687 --> 02:39:52.507]  Bloomberg?
[02:39:53.247 --> 02:39:54.288]  The billionaire?
[02:39:54.708 --> 02:39:55.589]  Running them ads?
[02:39:56.009 --> 02:39:57.590]  Bloomberg's going nowhere.
[02:39:58.330 --> 02:39:59.971]  Nowhere, no how, no way.
[02:40:00.031 --> 02:40:01.032]  I don't see it happening.
[02:40:01.532 --> 02:40:04.194]  The guy with that arrogant personality of his?
[02:40:04.214 --> 02:40:06.635]  Ain't going to happen.
[02:40:07.596 --> 02:40:07.676]  Oh!
[02:40:09.704 --> 02:40:12.265]  The blacks and Latinos are gonna love him.
[02:40:12.285 --> 02:40:19.307]  Yeah, the guy that gave you a stop and frisk in New York City.
[02:40:20.228 --> 02:40:22.829]  Millions don't like the way you look.
[02:40:23.269 --> 02:40:24.129]  Get over here.
[02:40:24.949 --> 02:40:27.010]  Oh, I found a joint on you.
[02:40:27.030 --> 02:40:28.090]  You're going to jail.
[02:40:30.031 --> 02:40:31.732]  And B.S.
[02:40:31.832 --> 02:40:37.934]  Bloomberg defended the violation of our rights with a stop and frisk.
[02:40:40.396 --> 02:40:43.257]  Up until he announced he's running for president.
[02:40:44.337 --> 02:40:44.657]  Yeah.
[02:40:45.558 --> 02:40:49.059]  What a low-life garbage man.
[02:40:49.079 --> 02:40:52.360]  Or I should say Bloomberg boy.
[02:40:52.660 --> 02:40:55.681]  Because all these guys are so tough.
[02:40:56.301 --> 02:41:00.943]  When they got their big guys around them to protect them.
[02:41:01.863 --> 02:41:04.544]  Couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag.
[02:41:05.044 --> 02:41:05.885]  Like most of them.
[02:41:06.385 --> 02:41:08.105]  Like that Schiffer guy too, right?
[02:41:08.546 --> 02:41:09.986]  Yeah, can't spell it the way I want.
[02:41:10.316 --> 02:41:12.857]  But take out that other words and put a T at the end.
[02:41:13.718 --> 02:41:14.758]  Little boys!
[02:41:16.820 --> 02:41:23.983]  Anyway, and when I talk about Bloomberg, one of our other big trends is off with their heads 2.0.
[02:41:24.564 --> 02:41:27.205]  You got riots going on around the world.
[02:41:27.265 --> 02:41:28.666]  I mentioned some of them before.
[02:41:28.686 --> 02:41:30.907]  You know what the big issue is?
[02:41:31.828 --> 02:41:34.069]  Hey, they got all the dough and we got none.
[02:41:34.978 --> 02:41:36.638]  Income inequality.
[02:41:36.978 --> 02:41:40.579]  That's the one thing that the Occupy Wall Street brought out.
[02:41:41.779 --> 02:41:47.300]  That the few cats got all the dough and the rest of us, we got to keep working and working to get everything that we have.
[02:41:48.380 --> 02:41:49.721]  And it's just us.
[02:41:50.181 --> 02:41:53.081]  They commit the crimes of trillions.
[02:41:54.561 --> 02:41:56.402]  And it is too big to jail.
[02:41:56.902 --> 02:41:57.962]  Yeah, you remember that?
[02:41:58.342 --> 02:41:59.902]  Eric Holder, you remember that?
[02:41:59.982 --> 02:42:00.603]  Holder this.
[02:42:01.743 --> 02:42:02.863]  Another low life.
[02:42:04.449 --> 02:42:05.130]  Slimer.
[02:42:05.971 --> 02:42:06.992]  Too big to jail.
[02:42:07.012 --> 02:42:09.916]  Hey, you went over the speed limit.
[02:42:09.936 --> 02:42:11.898]  You're 10 miles over the speed limit.
[02:42:12.398 --> 02:42:13.880]  Didn't have your parking light on.
[02:42:14.401 --> 02:42:17.244]  Yeah, the light over your, uh, license plate is off.
[02:42:17.284 --> 02:42:17.945]  Where were you?
[02:42:17.965 --> 02:42:18.806]  Get out of the car.
[02:42:18.826 --> 02:42:19.667]  Stand on your head.
[02:42:21.008 --> 02:42:22.590]  Repeat the alphabet backwards.
[02:42:23.451 --> 02:42:23.972]  Just us.
[02:42:24.722 --> 02:42:25.662]  Off with their heads.
[02:42:25.982 --> 02:42:30.543]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it and they're losing it around the world.
[02:42:30.723 --> 02:42:31.603]  They're losing it in Lebanon.
[02:42:31.623 --> 02:42:32.724]  They're losing it in Algeria.
[02:42:32.764 --> 02:42:33.784]  They're losing it in France.
[02:42:34.184 --> 02:42:35.264]  They're losing it in Chile.
[02:42:35.284 --> 02:42:37.825]  They're losing it in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru.
[02:42:38.565 --> 02:42:40.145]  They're losing it around the world.
[02:42:42.186 --> 02:42:47.687]  So, these cats are going to get more than bodyguards around them and find safe haven places to go to.
[02:42:48.887 --> 02:42:50.127]  Some other trends.
[02:42:51.007 --> 02:42:52.048]  Some other trends.
[02:42:53.508 --> 02:42:54.108]  Independence.
[02:42:54.758 --> 02:42:55.278]  That's right.
[02:42:56.019 --> 02:42:57.340]  Follow no leader.
[02:42:58.281 --> 02:43:05.346]  It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.
[02:43:06.466 --> 02:43:07.447]  Samuel Adams.
[02:43:08.087 --> 02:43:09.749]  And that's what's going on around the world.
[02:43:10.229 --> 02:43:11.590]  Every place that I mentioned.
[02:43:12.290 --> 02:43:13.351]  All those places.
[02:43:13.892 --> 02:43:17.614]  Hong Kong, France, Bolivia, Chile.
[02:43:17.934 --> 02:43:18.775]  One after another.
[02:43:19.656 --> 02:43:20.376]  No leaders.
[02:43:21.277 --> 02:43:22.838]  The people are leading themselves.
[02:43:23.436 --> 02:43:26.417]  I don't need anybody to lead me, Gabishen.
[02:43:29.218 --> 02:43:31.098]  I was not put on this earth to take orders.
[02:43:32.319 --> 02:43:32.859]  I don't give them.
[02:43:33.239 --> 02:43:33.819]  I don't take them.
[02:43:34.980 --> 02:43:36.120]  Do I follow instructions?
[02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:36.960]  Of course I do.
[02:43:37.460 --> 02:43:40.201]  Doctor tells me to do this or that, and I believe in what they're saying.
[02:43:41.141 --> 02:43:42.822]  I'm all ears and an open mind.
[02:43:43.402 --> 02:43:47.043]  Anybody that knows more than I do about different fields, love to listen.
[02:43:47.563 --> 02:43:49.304]  And a lot of fields I don't know anything about.
[02:43:50.264 --> 02:43:51.665]  But I don't follow orders.
[02:43:51.765 --> 02:43:52.465]  I salute.
[02:43:55.310 --> 02:43:57.911]  Independence and a big one.
[02:43:58.571 --> 02:44:00.872]  This is for the entrepreneurs.
[02:44:01.572 --> 02:44:03.613]  The Roaring 2020s.
[02:44:04.113 --> 02:44:05.054]  People are down.
[02:44:06.194 --> 02:44:08.075]  Look at all these movies they put out.
[02:44:09.075 --> 02:44:10.436]  Ah, Star Wars again.
[02:44:10.516 --> 02:44:11.196]  Oh, yeah.
[02:44:11.776 --> 02:44:15.838]  The cat, the kitten, the this, the that, all this.
[02:44:16.978 --> 02:44:21.260]  No happiness, no joy, no feeling up, no feeling high.
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:23.421]  The Roaring 2020s.
[02:44:25.066 --> 02:44:26.867]  The people are ready to break loose.
[02:44:28.347 --> 02:44:31.568]  The smart entrepreneurs that give them that with elegance.
[02:44:32.568 --> 02:44:35.009]  And it doesn't take a lot to be elegant.
[02:44:35.589 --> 02:44:39.931]  You can buy stuff online secondhand from the highest levels.
[02:44:40.651 --> 02:44:41.851]  The pennies on the dollar.
[02:44:43.292 --> 02:44:44.832]  Go back to the Great Depression.
[02:44:45.873 --> 02:44:48.193]  Hottest, happiest music America ever knew.
[02:44:48.553 --> 02:44:49.654]  It was swing time.
[02:44:49.674 --> 02:44:52.054]  I have a photo of my parents' wedding.
[02:44:52.094 --> 02:44:53.475]  May their souls rest in peace.
[02:44:54.005 --> 02:44:54.866]  Italian immigrants.
[02:44:57.008 --> 02:44:58.029]  Dressed to the nines, 1934.
[02:44:58.349 --> 02:45:00.971]  They were laborers.
[02:45:01.512 --> 02:45:02.693]  Worked in factories.
[02:45:04.835 --> 02:45:05.616]  Fish stores.
[02:45:06.436 --> 02:45:07.517]  Vegetable stores.
[02:45:09.980 --> 02:45:12.162]  Dressed beautifully.
[02:45:13.363 --> 02:45:13.823]  Elegance.
[02:45:14.324 --> 02:45:15.585]  This thing's going down.
[02:45:15.645 --> 02:45:17.567]  Not next year, but 2021's my year for the down.
[02:45:20.243 --> 02:45:21.583]  People ask me, what could I do?
[02:45:21.844 --> 02:45:24.824]  Get in the best shape you can, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[02:45:25.345 --> 02:45:26.205]  Raise the level.
[02:45:27.165 --> 02:45:27.745]  Step it up.
[02:45:28.145 --> 02:45:30.986]  Hey, you know that saying, pigs can't fly?
[02:45:32.307 --> 02:45:32.967]  You've heard that.
[02:45:33.767 --> 02:45:35.328]  Been to the airport lately?
[02:45:36.288 --> 02:45:37.368]  Look at the way people look.
[02:45:38.829 --> 02:45:41.169]  People from around the world come in and can't believe it.
[02:45:41.930 --> 02:45:42.990]  How low can you go?
[02:45:44.370 --> 02:45:45.131]  Not in the roaring 2020s.
[02:45:46.670 --> 02:45:50.752]  These are the entrepreneur opportunities.
[02:45:51.532 --> 02:45:54.213]  And again, you can get all this in your Trends Journal.
[02:45:55.074 --> 02:45:59.296]  It's the only magazine in the world that tells you what's going on.
[02:46:01.857 --> 02:46:03.498]  What it means and where it's going.
[02:46:07.940 --> 02:46:11.081]  Time Magazine, last week's news next week.
[02:46:11.141 --> 02:46:12.782]  Trends Journal, tomorrow's news today.
[02:46:13.562 --> 02:46:14.883]  And again, remember,
[02:46:15.782 --> 02:46:22.646]  Do what you can to support InfoWars this year, next year, and many years to come.
[02:46:24.647 --> 02:46:33.952]  Because InfoWars is putting out information that's the truth and helps you prepare.
[02:46:35.232 --> 02:46:37.754]  The mainstream media is a stupid, wasted joke.
[02:46:39.054 --> 02:46:44.277]  Again, a couple of people die, five, ten people die in a
[02:46:45.285 --> 02:46:46.965]  Volcano in New Zealand.
[02:46:47.005 --> 02:46:47.926]  Terrible story.
[02:46:48.006 --> 02:46:49.166]  Very sad for the people.
[02:46:49.906 --> 02:46:51.266]  But that's not going to help me.
[02:46:52.266 --> 02:46:55.507]  Learn about what's going on in the world and how to prepare for it.
[02:46:56.667 --> 02:46:56.927]  So.
[02:46:59.908 --> 02:47:00.548]  Real estate.
[02:47:02.689 --> 02:47:04.029]  This is going to be the peak year.
[02:47:04.769 --> 02:47:06.129]  You're going to lower interest rates.
[02:47:07.169 --> 02:47:12.911]  By this time next year, we believe we're going to see them down to zero to negative percent.
[02:47:13.491 --> 02:47:14.931]  So it's going to keep boosting the market.
[02:47:15.350 --> 02:47:17.450]  But in the big cities, it's already slowing down.
[02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:19.511]  New York, New York, New York.
[02:47:20.131 --> 02:47:26.232]  One more rent sign on Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue.
[02:47:26.672 --> 02:47:26.992]  Yeah.
[02:47:28.352 --> 02:47:28.893]  It's peaked.
[02:47:29.713 --> 02:47:31.293]  Overseas, forget about it.
[02:47:31.753 --> 02:47:32.853]  Melbourne, Sydney.
[02:47:34.454 --> 02:47:34.814]  Down.
[02:47:35.934 --> 02:47:36.234]  So.
[02:47:38.514 --> 02:47:41.595]  What you can do is profit from the future.
[02:47:42.398 --> 02:47:44.019]  That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy real estate.
[02:47:44.059 --> 02:47:45.501]  I don't tell anybody what to do.
[02:47:45.961 --> 02:47:48.824]  And gold, I still see gold being golden.
[02:47:49.725 --> 02:47:57.011]  Even with the markets going up and they keep hitting new highs because all that cheap money coming into the repo markets, gold is still doing well.
[02:47:57.972 --> 02:48:00.074]  So, remember, has to break below $14.50.
[02:48:00.154 --> 02:48:00.855]  From there I see it at $13.90.
[02:48:00.895 --> 02:48:01.795]  Breaks above $15.70, I see it headed to a $2,000.
[02:48:10.031 --> 02:48:11.892]  So this is a wild ride into the future.
[02:48:11.932 --> 02:48:12.813]  Prepare yourself.
[02:48:13.433 --> 02:48:14.034]  Step it up.
[02:48:14.454 --> 02:48:16.175]  It's the roaring 2020s.
[02:48:16.696 --> 02:48:22.420]  Feel good about you, about yourself, and about everything else that could bring you higher.
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:24.341]  The future's in your hands.
[02:48:24.922 --> 02:48:25.782]  Don't drop it.
[02:48:27.063 --> 02:48:28.404]  You create the future.
[02:48:28.704 --> 02:48:36.230]  The people of InfoWars, the people who subscribe to the Trends Journal, the people that want freedom, justice, and the American way.
[02:48:37.130 --> 02:48:38.031]  You're the future.
[02:48:39.707 --> 02:48:44.919]  Don't let anybody tell you differently, because if they do, you're out of luck.
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:46.222]  Thank you very much.
[02:48:46.823 --> 02:48:47.585]  See you next time.
[02:48:59.690 --> 02:49:03.452]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[02:49:03.992 --> 02:49:07.213]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[02:49:07.473 --> 02:49:10.134]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[02:49:10.755 --> 02:49:13.616]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[02:49:14.296 --> 02:49:15.957]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:49:16.537 --> 02:49:17.998]  I suggest BAN.VIDEO.
[02:49:18.619 --> 02:49:23.723]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:49:24.103 --> 02:49:32.030]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:49:32.570 --> 02:49:38.955]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:49:39.276 --> 02:49:42.098]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[02:49:48.968 --> 02:49:55.512]  There's a war on Christmas, there's a war on America, there's a war on our free speech, there's a war on the family's very existence.
[02:49:56.012 --> 02:49:59.114]  And all over the world, Christians are being persecuted.
[02:49:59.915 --> 02:50:04.918]  But Hollywood and the corporate media promote it like it doesn't happen, or that it's something cute, it's something funny.
[02:50:05.799 --> 02:50:06.759]  But it really is a sick.
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:13.664]  And those very same forces that have it out for Christianity, have it out for Infowars, and have it out for you and your family.
[02:50:14.394 --> 02:50:21.619]  But bottom line, when you spread the word about Infowars, when you spread the word about the videos and the articles, you make these scumbags so damn angry.
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:27.644]  Just like when you use the term Merry Christmas, they absolutely hate that because they want to make you say Happy Holidays.
[02:50:28.124 --> 02:50:30.646]  They want to make you talk like they want you to talk.
[02:50:30.666 --> 02:50:32.447]  They want to make you their puppets.
[02:50:32.507 --> 02:50:34.929]  Well, I'm not their puppet, and I know you're not their puppet.
[02:50:35.469 --> 02:50:38.932]  And once we're awake, and once we're pissed off, and once we're not submitting to them,
[02:50:40.211 --> 02:50:42.815]  Once we start exercising our speech, we start winning.
[02:50:42.856 --> 02:50:45.019]  And that's what's been happening, that's why they've been censoring us.
[02:50:45.760 --> 02:50:47.143]  But they can't stop you from getting the word out.
[02:50:48.433 --> 02:50:50.854]  If you fund InfoWars, there's really nothing they can do.
[02:50:50.874 --> 02:50:51.894]  We're going to stay on the air.
[02:50:51.914 --> 02:50:53.235]  We're going to expand in 2020.
[02:50:53.795 --> 02:50:56.576]  But we need you to go to InfoWarsStore.com this Christmas.
[02:50:56.716 --> 02:50:59.257]  We need you to fund InfoWars by getting great products you need.
[02:50:59.297 --> 02:51:00.898]  We've got huge sales going right now.
[02:51:00.998 --> 02:51:03.019]  Double Patriot points, the 12 days of Christmas.
[02:51:03.159 --> 02:51:07.261]  Some of these are the biggest sales we've ever offered, and you're truly investing in your future when you do it.
[02:51:07.281 --> 02:51:08.781]  So go check out the Patriot apparel.
[02:51:08.861 --> 02:51:10.922]  Go check out the Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[02:51:11.002 --> 02:51:13.163]  He's like Christmas lights, they don't hang themselves shirt.
[02:51:13.243 --> 02:51:14.283]  Check out the ball caps.
[02:51:14.343 --> 02:51:16.044]  Check out the air filtration, the water filtration.
[02:51:16.144 --> 02:51:17.807]  And give yourself the gift of great products.
[02:51:17.827 --> 02:51:23.154]  Give your family and friends and neighbors and co-workers the gift of great products, books, films, you name it, thousands of items.
[02:51:23.255 --> 02:51:29.504]  And then also give yourself the gift of information warfare and putting your money on an organization that will not back down, that will not give in.
[02:51:29.564 --> 02:51:30.145]  You're amazing.
[02:51:30.165 --> 02:51:31.547]  I want to thank you all for putting up with me.
[02:51:31.667 --> 02:51:39.490]  I want to just encourage you with this Christmas and the New Year coming up to redouble your efforts to exercise your free speech or lose it and don't let the authoritarians bully you into submission.
[02:51:39.710 --> 02:51:44.752]  Whatever your speech is, whatever your ideas are, whatever your religion is or lack of, it doesn't matter.
[02:51:44.812 --> 02:51:55.075]  You should exercise what you believe and what you stand for and not go with the corporate media or the universities or any of these institutions that are attacking your right to say what you want.
[02:51:55.315 --> 02:51:59.657]  There are a lot of countries where you don't have free speech and people can move to those but they don't want to.
[02:52:00.461 --> 02:52:06.042]  They want to come here because America was known for freedom, but we're losing that freedom and we need to stand up for it now.
[02:52:06.642 --> 02:52:09.143]  So again, we need funds to keep our organization on air.
[02:52:09.163 --> 02:52:11.163]  We're not funded by Soros and billionaires and globals.
[02:52:11.183 --> 02:52:13.684]  We're funded by viewers and listeners just like you.
[02:52:13.704 --> 02:52:14.404]  They're just like us.
[02:52:14.744 --> 02:52:16.465]  So thank you for your support in the last few years.
[02:52:17.005 --> 02:52:19.505]  And for some of you going back 25 years, we've come so far together.
[02:52:19.905 --> 02:52:22.306]  Let's see how far we come together in the future.
[02:52:22.326 --> 02:52:27.147]  Let's see how far we go, because we've already done some incredible things, but we're going to do even more amazing things.
[02:52:27.634 --> 02:52:34.558]  There's a lot of talk out there in the world about, do this and you'll get results or support us and you're going to see amazing things happen.
[02:52:34.598 --> 02:52:35.819]  And most of it's talk.
[02:52:57.648 --> 02:52:59.949]  Almost none of these groups or organizations ever deliver.
[02:53:00.369 --> 02:53:01.890]  InfoWars does deliver.
[02:53:02.390 --> 02:53:07.653]  And that's why they're trying to destroy us, that's why they're trying to put me in prison, that's why they're trying to shut us down so we can't stay on air.
[02:53:08.413 --> 02:53:14.356]  So when I tell you something, I've done research and I really believe it, and I'm almost always right, and you know that.
[02:53:14.376 --> 02:53:19.438]  And you give us intel, and you're part of our eyes and ears, and I appreciate you, and we're in this together.
[02:53:19.899 --> 02:53:20.279]  But listen.
[02:53:20.959 --> 02:53:22.900]  There's a globalist system that's got to come down.
[02:53:23.321 --> 02:53:24.882]  And we're going to beat their ass politically.
[02:53:25.262 --> 02:53:28.785]  But I need your support now more than ever and we make it so easy.
[02:53:29.625 --> 02:53:35.329]  We've got really amazing products at Enforgedore.com, particularly the supplements at Enforged Life.
[02:53:36.590 --> 02:53:41.994]  And I work all the time, I eat the wrong foods, I get back in shape, I get out of shape.
[02:53:42.394 --> 02:53:44.916]  And the fastest way I get out of shape is forgetting to take the supplements.
[02:53:45.276 --> 02:53:48.258]  So I religiously, starting about 95 days ago or so,
[02:53:49.790 --> 02:53:55.735]  Little over three months began to take our mainline supplements every day religiously and it's been the best ever.
[02:53:56.055 --> 02:54:00.599]  And not just physically losing weight, but the clarity and the focus and the energy.
[02:54:00.739 --> 02:54:03.161]  I mean, it's hard for me not to work 20 hours a day.
[02:54:03.321 --> 02:54:04.802]  It's simply incredible.
[02:54:05.543 --> 02:54:09.186]  And more than just stuff that has energy like Brain Force Plus, that's great.
[02:54:09.686 --> 02:54:10.567]  It's the iodine.
[02:54:10.867 --> 02:54:11.748]  It's the fish oil.
[02:54:11.888 --> 02:54:13.750]  It's taking the knockout to sleep better at night.
[02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:15.631]  It's taking the bone broth.
[02:54:15.831 --> 02:54:17.092]  It's taking the DNA Force Plus.
[02:54:17.112 --> 02:54:17.693]  That's number one.
[02:54:18.133 --> 02:54:20.273]  All of that together, it's just been explosive.
[02:54:20.634 --> 02:54:33.296]  And we also have the great Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste with Iodine and Colloidal Silver, and now the new Super Silver Toothpaste that doesn't just have the silver saw, but it also has a remineralization system in it as well.
[02:54:33.316 --> 02:54:34.656]  We're very, very proud of that toothpaste.
[02:54:34.976 --> 02:54:42.957]  But the bottom line is this, your purchase of the products fund our operation and make it all possible, and they really do work, and so it's a win-win for everybody.
[02:54:43.238 --> 02:54:45.638]  Please do your Christmas shopping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:54:48.536 --> 02:54:52.019]  InfoWars is hiring for the 2020 election.
[02:54:52.399 --> 02:54:53.740]  We need camera operators.
[02:54:53.820 --> 02:54:55.141]  We need radio producers.
[02:54:55.501 --> 02:54:56.462]  We need journalists.
[02:54:56.522 --> 02:54:57.683]  We need researchers.
[02:54:58.003 --> 02:55:01.866]  We need people that want to take America back from the globalists.
[02:55:01.906 --> 02:55:04.068]  Now, here's how you get a shot at that.
[02:55:04.328 --> 02:55:05.929]  We can't wait to meet you and work with you.
[02:55:06.350 --> 02:55:11.454]  Send a PDF resume with at least three online links
[02:55:12.094 --> 02:55:24.258]  Two, jobs at Infowars.com and do it in the next few weeks because we want to be hiring new folks to join the team by early next year.
[02:55:24.278 --> 02:55:33.442]  2020 is so critical, ladies and gentlemen, and we need the best people with the best minds that want to stand in the face of the tyrants and take action.
[02:55:33.502 --> 02:55:34.042]  So again,
[02:55:34.562 --> 02:55:43.512]  Please send your PDF resume with at least three online links of your work to jobs at Infowars.com.
[02:55:43.812 --> 02:55:47.657]  We're looking for men and women that want to live in a free country and a free world.
