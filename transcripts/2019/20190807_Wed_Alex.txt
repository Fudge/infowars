[00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.711]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:16.421]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.912 --> 00:00:30.654]  So I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos of these Facebooks and these tweets and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[00:00:31.034 --> 00:00:37.296]  Now four media giants are banding together to take down controversial InfoWars content from their site.
[00:00:37.456 --> 00:00:44.377]  YouTube, Facebook, and Apple all announcing they're removing his content from their platforms.
[00:00:44.557 --> 00:00:47.339]  Yesterday, Alex Jones became an un-person.
[00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.303]  Apple last night removed the entire library of Alex Jones' podcasts from their store.
[00:00:53.403 --> 00:00:59.827]  The conspiracy theories are beyond the realm, are not only beyond being offensive, they're dangerous.
[00:00:59.907 --> 00:01:09.353]  And we don't do enough in telling people out there right now this morning, people who read newspapers, exactly who these people are and what they believe.
[00:01:09.993 --> 00:01:21.899]  I am here because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead of this critical midterm election.
[00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.723]  And the big tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner, who's running this whole thing,
[00:01:29.463 --> 00:01:30.744]  The idea of a shadow ban is that
[00:01:54.938 --> 00:02:00.343]  You ban someone but they don't know they've been banned because they keep posting but no one sees their content.
[00:02:00.663 --> 00:02:08.270]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other.
[00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:18.220]  Just like communist China, this is dangerous authoritarianism and they've packaged silencing Americans who are popular and well-spoken, as Tucker Carlson said about me on Fox News,
[00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.983]  Not because what I say is bad, but because what I say is effective, and true, and popular.
[00:02:23.083 --> 00:02:27.807]  Hey, Jackson, I appreciate your First Amendment, but I have a right to face my accusers, Jack.
[00:02:28.387 --> 00:02:30.849]  You are incredibly shameful.
[00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:32.550]  Look at you.
[00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:37.054]  You are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech coward.
[00:02:37.354 --> 00:02:37.834]  Who are you?
[00:02:37.894 --> 00:02:39.115]  I swear to God I don't know who you are, man.
[00:02:39.135 --> 00:02:40.476]  Yeah, you better hope you can be platforming.
[00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:41.457]  Tens of billions of views.
[00:02:41.977 --> 00:02:43.378]  InfoWars.
[00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:44.858]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[00:02:44.978 --> 00:02:46.059]  He's playing this joke over here.
[00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:53.502]  If at that point somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones, well, they were looking for him speaking with anyone.
[00:02:54.302 --> 00:03:06.267]  And they tell Congress that they're not censoring anybody, even though we have all the Google documents, we have internal Google videos, we have internal Twitter videos, where their executives talk about how they're censoring everyone.
[00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:07.748]  I think as someone with
[00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:15.491]  A PhD in computer science and five years of working at one of the world's top computer science companies.
[00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.513]  I don't see any doubt that it's very politically biased.
[00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:22.094]  Your censorship will not work anymore, Sundar.
[00:03:22.554 --> 00:03:27.536]  We're aware of your activities, trying to muzzle the American people and gaming your search results.
[00:03:28.137 --> 00:03:29.717]  Google is evil.
[00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:31.758]  Google is evil.
[00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:33.059]  Google is...
[00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:45.747]  In 2016, Google's search algorithm likely impacted undecided voters in a way that shifted at least 2.6 million votes to Hillary Clinton, whom I supported.
[00:03:46.688 --> 00:03:54.153]  I know this because I preserved more than 13,000 election-related searches prior to Election Day.
[00:03:54.753 --> 00:04:00.618]  And Google's search results were significantly biased in favor of Secretary Clinton.
[00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:09.766]  When I joined Google, I saw a lot of employees being mistreated and abused and harassed for sharing conservative views or just for questioning company policies.
[00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:11.407]  I don't get a day in court.
[00:04:11.447 --> 00:04:12.168]  They lie about me.
[00:04:12.368 --> 00:04:13.990]  Google only puts lies up.
[00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.192]  All the top searches are lies about me and my family.
[00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:23.940]  And that guy helps round up political dissidents, and then his people come to lie to Congress over and over and over again, and we don't get to respond to them.
[00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:32.189]  So Google is helping build censorship systems in China for a global social score they've tested there to totally control every aspect of our lives.
[00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:40.975]  There's this very peculiar background where Google is working with the Chinese Communist government and not with the U.S.
[00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:41.435]  military.
[00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:44.757]  So the Project Maven decision was a decision not to work with AI.
[00:04:45.338 --> 00:04:50.762]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back on this Wednesday, August 7th, 2019, Global Transmission.
[00:04:52.603 --> 00:04:57.666]  As I warned, Pakistan is now announcing that they intend to go to war with India.
[00:04:58.747 --> 00:04:59.468]  This is huge.
[00:04:59.488 --> 00:04:59.868]  Stay with us.

[00:06:12.573 --> 00:06:14.074]  ...want us to speak.
[00:06:14.114 --> 00:06:15.195]  Think, just let me think!
[00:06:15.255 --> 00:06:20.438]  ...even now, orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:06:20.478 --> 00:06:22.120]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.480]  Damn it!
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.840]  Why?
[00:06:23.581 --> 00:06:29.645]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:33.328]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen,
[00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:40.942]  The truth is, sir, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:06:40.962 --> 00:06:41.922]  You designed it, sir.
[00:06:41.982 --> 00:06:42.903]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:06:42.923 --> 00:06:44.264]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:06:44.584 --> 00:06:48.026]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[00:06:48.486 --> 00:06:57.931]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[00:06:57.991 --> 00:06:58.311]  Cameras.
[00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.051]  We need cameras.
[00:06:59.332 --> 00:07:00.092]  How did this happen?
[00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:01.533]  Who's to blame?
[00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:05.158]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:07:05.178 --> 00:07:07.062]  They will be held accountable.
[00:07:07.102 --> 00:07:12.972]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:07:14.173 --> 00:07:15.894]  I know why you did it.
[00:07:16.154 --> 00:07:17.174]  I know you were afraid.
[00:07:17.674 --> 00:07:18.375]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:19.395]  War?
[00:07:19.655 --> 00:07:20.035]  Terror?
[00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:20.956]  Disease?
[00:07:21.576 --> 00:07:27.398]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:07:28.038 --> 00:07:33.820]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:40.603]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:07:47.298 --> 00:07:48.499]  There is a war.
[00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:49.980]  It's happening now.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.661]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:55.023]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:07:55.803 --> 00:07:57.284]  We are the Resistance.
[00:07:57.725 --> 00:07:59.346]  We are the Infowar.
[00:08:12.654 --> 00:08:19.240]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.622]  You better believe you got one!
[00:08:23.764 --> 00:08:29.029]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:06.496]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:09:06.556 --> 00:09:06.916]  Welcome.
[00:09:06.956 --> 00:09:09.839]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live worldwide transmission.
[00:09:10.439 --> 00:09:14.903]  Wednesday, August 7th, 2009.
[00:09:18.706 --> 00:09:25.752]  Pakistan warns of war after India's move to end Kashmir's special status.
[00:09:26.573 --> 00:09:28.695]  And the entire leftist to globalist media
[00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:40.376]  ...decries India taking back roughly 20% of their nation that was taken by Islamists from them with the UN's backing.
[00:09:41.957 --> 00:09:44.119]  All of Pakistan was once India.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:50.204]  India once stretched all the way to where Iran is today and then into the middle of China.
[00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:52.805]  But it's been taken.
[00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:55.948]  And the Communist Chinese have invaded
[00:09:57.332 --> 00:10:15.836]  With paramilitary playing close people, they've been aiding the Islamicists and working with Pakistan, and Modi has been telling them, since he got into office, that they better stop or he's going to stop letting it be an autonomous zone and is going to invade.
[00:10:19.897 --> 00:10:26.898]  Local governments will still be in control there, but Indian citizens will be allowed to move there.
[00:10:28.186 --> 00:10:29.307]  You know why that's important?
[00:10:30.688 --> 00:10:48.178]  There are millions and millions and millions and millions of Indians who are Hindus or who are Buddhist or who are Christians who were driven out of Kashmir in the last 70 years.
[00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:56.123]  By a strange twist of fate, yesterday I was with my wife shopping
[00:10:59.372 --> 00:11:01.353]  Replacing something that she lost.
[00:11:03.013 --> 00:11:08.215]  And the man helping us was a gentleman from Kashmir.
[00:11:10.235 --> 00:11:12.816]  Basically, a refugee from Kashmir.
[00:11:12.836 --> 00:11:16.077]  And we talked about 20 minutes about the situation.
[00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:18.538]  So you think about that.
[00:11:18.618 --> 00:11:28.921]  The Muslims made India make a deal where people that aren't Muslims can't move, even if they lived there previously, to Kashmir.
[00:11:32.176 --> 00:11:33.117]  But see, that's how it works.
[00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:37.279]  Once the Muslims become a majority, they say, hey, hit the road, Jack.
[00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:42.102]  And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.
[00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:43.803]  Hit the road, Jack.
[00:11:44.343 --> 00:11:47.986]  And don't you come back no more, no more, no more.
[00:11:49.747 --> 00:12:01.434]  And so CNN, the Associated Press, and all of them are, oh, Indian, Hindu, extremist, supremacist, nationalist,
[00:12:03.089 --> 00:12:04.990]  Have gone into Kashmir.
[00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.771]  And it could cause world war.
[00:12:09.432 --> 00:12:10.852]  The most dangerous place in the world.
[00:12:10.892 --> 00:12:11.612]  The flashpoint.
[00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:19.736]  Now again, notice this all started Monday, when China devalued their currency that also screws over India.
[00:12:20.896 --> 00:12:25.118]  And China is taking about 30% of the country without asking.
[00:12:25.358 --> 00:12:26.839]  They were never even in the deal!
[00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:29.660]  The autonomous UN 1949, original deal 1947.
[00:12:34.594 --> 00:12:39.998]  And now, suicide bombers every week are blowing people up at military bases.
[00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:43.922]  They're driving trucks into military bases all over India.
[00:12:45.603 --> 00:12:56.512]  And Modi said, listen, I know the Khani Network and all you guys are behind it, so we're gonna send in, the word is, the real word is, a half a million troops.
[00:12:56.652 --> 00:12:58.433]  That's the numbers I've got from inside sources.
[00:12:58.934 --> 00:13:00.095]  A half a million.
[00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:08.162]  Or roughly 40% of India's military has rotated into Kashmir.
[00:13:09.783 --> 00:13:11.544]  So yeah, this is the stuff World War is made of.
[00:13:11.784 --> 00:13:13.745]  So there's a lot of other incredible breaking news.
[00:13:14.246 --> 00:13:18.708]  But I kind of obsessed on this for three, four hours yesterday, because it is a big deal.
[00:13:18.768 --> 00:13:23.391]  And obviously any of our military listeners or folks that are into history know how serious this is.
[00:13:24.092 --> 00:13:29.435]  But I'm going to suspend coverage of it until
[00:13:33.797 --> 00:13:38.498]  Later in the second hour, because I really want to be able to cover all the other big stuff that's been breaking, and take your calls.
[00:13:38.558 --> 00:13:40.839]  But nothing is as big as this.
[00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:56.543]  And it all ties in to the proxy war, World War IV that started, with China devaluing the currency, with the economic warfare going on, and with Trump increasing the tariffs another $300 billion on top of the other $300 billion.
[00:13:59.324 --> 00:14:01.545]  China, again, was given a one-sided deal
[00:14:03.206 --> 00:14:12.572]  Allowing all of this, and there's another very important paper out today that I'll be hitting next hour from the National Endowment of Democracy.
[00:14:12.632 --> 00:14:17.916]  The National Endowment of Democracy, it's really a think tank CIA group, is a U.S.
[00:14:17.976 --> 00:14:20.197]  nonprofit soft power organization.
[00:14:21.438 --> 00:14:28.463]  And then it just goes into how they are trying to establish a peaceful world government.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.206]  And the reason this is so important is this is the establishment.
[00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:40.302]  And you read their testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
[00:14:43.078 --> 00:14:52.826]  It is word for word, word for word, what I've been telling you about China for at least 15 years that I've been hot on the China issue.
[00:14:53.466 --> 00:15:03.914]  That they've infiltrated the media, the colleges, the high schools, that they're buying off the reporters and that they're the ones funding all the social warfare breakdown.
[00:15:03.974 --> 00:15:09.618]  Yeah, when you see people saying the president's a white supremacist and that he's directly responsible,
[00:15:10.486 --> 00:15:12.447]  For the deaths in El Paso?
[00:15:13.348 --> 00:15:14.828]  And that he better not show his face there?
[00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:20.691]  Those people are getting money from companies that are multinational, that are Chi-Com owned.
[00:15:22.212 --> 00:15:27.635]  And the Chi-Coms have a term they use called sharp power.
[00:15:30.737 --> 00:15:34.219]  And that's a nice word for absolute criminal mafia activity.
[00:15:37.623 --> 00:15:39.084]  No holds barred warfare.
[00:15:39.684 --> 00:15:43.267]  Economically, culturally, and this whole thing breaks it down.
[00:15:43.827 --> 00:15:47.909]  So when I tell you the Democrats are CHICOM operatives, they are.
[00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.330]  Now let that sink in.
[00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:57.555]  That's why they're distracting with this Russia stuff that I'll tell you, Russia can't tie its shoelaces, man.
[00:15:58.416 --> 00:16:01.518]  Russia is teetering on the verge of having the globalists overthrow it.
[00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:15.135]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[00:16:15.635 --> 00:16:18.196]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:16:18.557 --> 00:16:21.538]  No one can doubt that InfoWars has changed the world.
[00:16:22.058 --> 00:16:31.723]  The globalists give us credit for discrediting their world government system, their neoliberal fascist plan, and infecting, in their words,
[00:16:32.663 --> 00:16:35.365]  The entire world was nationalism.
[00:16:35.645 --> 00:16:37.146]  Now, how did I do that?
[00:16:38.307 --> 00:16:39.427]  I did that because of you.
[00:16:40.008 --> 00:16:40.548]  We did that.
[00:16:41.048 --> 00:16:41.609]  You did that.
[00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:44.330]  We're either going to have freedom or we're going to have slavery.
[00:16:45.031 --> 00:16:48.493]  And these corporatists play nation states off against each other.
[00:16:49.053 --> 00:16:50.474]  They play men and women off against each other.
[00:16:50.494 --> 00:16:53.055]  They play people off against each other for what color their skin is.
[00:16:54.156 --> 00:16:57.318]  But the people of the world more and more are seeing through it.
[00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:00.240]  And that's why I want all of you right now
[00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:16.521]  As the world government falls apart, as the New World Order hits the panic button and tries to start a race war, to realize that we have come so far, and that all these globalists have now is trying to stir up internal information warfare fights.
[00:17:17.522 --> 00:17:28.465]  But we knew history, and knew that these globalists are arrogant, and there would come a time when their system would enter a crisis, when it actually tried to implement
[00:17:29.733 --> 00:17:33.839]  It's incredibly anti-human agenda.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.024]  You know, I don't spend valuable time on air.
[00:17:38.288 --> 00:17:49.955]  Showing you the infrastructure here, showing you what goes into it, showing you how much money it costs to run this and do this, especially since we were deplatformed one year ago today.
[00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:56.458]  That's why we're calling it the one-year anniversary of the first domino to be unpersoned, to be sent into a black hole, the Phantom Zone.
[00:17:56.518 --> 00:17:58.459]  But the globalists did it too early.
[00:17:58.479 --> 00:18:05.944]  There's still talk radio, there's still TV, there's still independent websites like Infowars.com and Newswars.com that are on the air.
[00:18:07.084 --> 00:18:18.049]  And people have word of mouth to say, hey, just because you can't say Alex Jones's name on Facebook, unless it's a negative statement, or can't show InfoWars.com, you can tell your office about InfoWars.com.
[00:18:18.569 --> 00:18:20.470]  You can tell your neighbors about NewsWars.com.
[00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.071]  You can share our videos and our articles.
[00:18:23.091 --> 00:18:23.791]  We have our own site.
[00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:24.551]  We have our own platform.
[00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:28.233]  That's the beauty of what's happening here.
[00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:31.454]  That's the beauty of what's unfolding.
[00:18:32.154 --> 00:18:33.215]  And it's a real fight.
[00:18:34.369 --> 00:18:39.691]  And things aren't going to go the way this whole synthetic technocracy want them to go, because you've been standing in the gap.
[00:18:40.511 --> 00:18:41.411]  You've been spreading the word.
[00:18:41.992 --> 00:18:42.632]  You've been praying.

[00:18:57.117 --> 00:18:57.977]  Double Patriot points.

[00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.650]  Every time you stand up to leftist police.
[00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.010]  Every time you tell the truth.
[00:19:24.171 --> 00:19:28.672]  Every time you keep this symbol of free speech and pro-human values alive.
[00:19:28.692 --> 00:19:31.733]  The enemy comes one step closer to their system falling.
[00:19:31.893 --> 00:19:35.494]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[00:19:36.274 --> 00:19:40.355]  And now we've got a fighting chance, if we all take action, of defeating the globalists.
[00:19:40.775 --> 00:19:41.235]  Stay with us.
[00:19:41.455 --> 00:19:42.075]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:42.476 --> 00:19:43.696]  But please take advantage of the sale.
[00:20:05.948 --> 00:20:18.499]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:24.685 --> 00:20:26.166]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:26.987 --> 00:20:32.191]  India is now in a proxy war with the United States against China, as China threatens to invade
[00:20:33.311 --> 00:20:35.572]  Taiwan is invading with paramilitary forces.
[00:20:36.052 --> 00:20:36.632]  Hong Kong.
[00:20:39.213 --> 00:20:46.536]  We have the deep state here openly trying to trigger an open civil war and they're actually starting to get some traction.
[00:20:49.297 --> 00:20:55.339]  It's now emerged that the shooter in Ohio was basically responding to what he thought was a right-wing attack in
[00:20:56.505 --> 00:21:02.788]  El Paso and so a avowed devil worshipper and a worshipper of Antifa and the rape of women.
[00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:09.992]  He actually was in a cult that had a rock band that was into the direct rape of women and torture of women.
[00:21:10.032 --> 00:21:10.973]  He loved Bernie Sanders.
[00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:15.475]  This is the standard meth-head, woman-hating demon we've described for you.
[00:21:15.495 --> 00:21:16.076]  He was an incel.
[00:21:17.307 --> 00:21:17.948]  Incel demon.
[00:21:18.589 --> 00:21:22.195]  And so he went out in a blaze of blood and death killing his own sister.
[00:21:22.716 --> 00:21:23.737]  And now it's our fault.
[00:21:23.757 --> 00:21:26.181]  We've got to turn our guns in so this guy can come kill us.
[00:21:26.602 --> 00:21:27.243]  Our people like him.
[00:21:28.456 --> 00:21:31.479]  The same spirit just jumps out of him into somebody else and goes and has some fun.
[00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:34.141]  So we've got that all coming up.
[00:21:34.221 --> 00:21:41.468]  We've got Boy Scouts have a pedophile epidemic, MSM reports, and are hiding hundreds in its ranks.
[00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:43.029]  They're not hiding anything.
[00:21:43.069 --> 00:21:45.672]  They hand out the condoms and tell people to have sex with five-year-olds.
[00:21:45.712 --> 00:21:46.272]  That's official.
[00:21:47.033 --> 00:21:52.698]  So I was on an airplane with one of the Boy Scouts of America leaders.
[00:21:53.679 --> 00:22:00.925]  And I guess he didn't know who I was, and he was talking on the phone when we landed about how they were going to cover it up.
[00:22:01.406 --> 00:22:03.127]  I didn't even say anything, but sorry.
[00:22:03.347 --> 00:22:04.408]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:22:04.748 --> 00:22:08.331]  Oh, and don't forget, we've got all these other shows that are tomorrow's news today.
[00:22:09.252 --> 00:22:13.095]  We've got Owen Schroyer, weekdays, 3 p.m., with The War Room.
[00:22:13.115 --> 00:22:17.659]  We've got David Knight, weekday mornings, 8 a.m., with The David Knight Show, and so much more.
[00:22:17.719 --> 00:22:21.763]  Also, the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m., and there are those times for you on screen.
[00:22:23.101 --> 00:22:27.565]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:22:28.306 --> 00:22:30.628]  Let me make a few announcements here in this shorter segment.
[00:22:32.009 --> 00:22:33.891]  I told you that we were going to be suing folks.
[00:22:34.692 --> 00:22:35.712]  And I'm not happy about that.
[00:22:35.752 --> 00:22:36.333]  It takes money.
[00:22:36.493 --> 00:22:37.994]  We're not going to file fake lawsuits.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:45.062]  They spent over $2 million trying to get $15,000 from us for the Peppy the Frog situation.
[00:22:45.423 --> 00:22:52.765]  The judge basically ordered them to settle and told us, too, if you go to trial, it's not going to go well.
[00:22:53.186 --> 00:22:55.967]  So we said, OK, when the judge tells you, that will do it.
[00:22:56.567 --> 00:22:58.828]  So they got $15,000 for $2 million.
[00:22:59.688 --> 00:23:00.548]  That's how we operate.
[00:23:01.069 --> 00:23:02.089]  And I spent $100,000 of your money fighting.
[00:23:05.512 --> 00:23:07.192]  So I try to be judicious about all this.
[00:23:07.252 --> 00:23:09.113]  I work as hard as I can to keep this place afloat.
[00:23:09.153 --> 00:23:12.253]  But we've defeated over 30 plus of the lawsuits that are filed.
[00:23:12.293 --> 00:23:13.374]  We've defeated over 20 of the 30.
[00:23:15.374 --> 00:23:21.695]  And the Supreme Court of Connecticut did a public interest event.
[00:23:21.915 --> 00:23:24.236]  These are like one out of 5,000 or more, I'm told.
[00:23:24.876 --> 00:23:29.897]  Where they came in, stayed the persecution I'm going through in New Haven, Connecticut.
[00:23:30.197 --> 00:23:31.297]  They're in Skull and Bones country.
[00:23:31.317 --> 00:23:33.978]  I mean, the tomb is right down the road.
[00:23:35.811 --> 00:23:37.252]  One of the big Illuminati secret societies.
[00:23:37.852 --> 00:23:40.013]  And the Supreme Court came in and said, this is unprecedented.
[00:23:40.073 --> 00:23:45.616]  We're going to have hearings on this, on what you're doing to Mr. Jones, because it's just incredible.
[00:23:46.677 --> 00:23:50.859]  I mean, the judge will say stuff like, we know you've got marketing and made money off Sandy Hook.
[00:23:50.879 --> 00:23:52.360]  And we go, there is no marketing.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.781]  And they go, sanctions!
[00:23:54.922 --> 00:23:55.442]  We know!
[00:23:56.182 --> 00:23:59.124]  What, because Blumenthal and his sons say?
[00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:00.485]  Our listeners know.
[00:24:00.545 --> 00:24:01.685]  We've hardly ever talked about it.
[00:24:01.885 --> 00:24:02.686]  I can't stand it!
[00:24:03.749 --> 00:24:07.310]  Google Analytics shows 0.2 coverage of it.
[00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.651]  And that's with the media attacking me, being forced to cover it.
[00:24:12.692 --> 00:24:13.412]  But I digress.
[00:24:14.792 --> 00:24:19.834]  I knew a month before Barnes had intel that the Covington Kid suits were going to be thrown out.
[00:24:20.234 --> 00:24:23.175]  And I'm not going to say what he told me off record, but he was dead on.
[00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:25.396]  It was thrown directly out.
[00:24:26.836 --> 00:24:31.818]  And that's why he was waiting for it to be thrown out until he filed his.
[00:24:32.807 --> 00:24:34.008]  You notice he filed that last week.
[00:24:35.249 --> 00:24:36.430]  There's more about to be filed.
[00:24:36.751 --> 00:24:37.151]  A bunch.
[00:24:38.052 --> 00:24:39.253]  And it's being worked on right now.
[00:24:39.353 --> 00:24:41.675]  I've got 10 lawsuits to choose from.
[00:24:42.416 --> 00:24:50.683]  That's what I've been doing in my extra time is looking at 10 lawsuits with Barnes and which ones we're going to pull the trigger on first.
[00:24:51.864 --> 00:24:52.685]  We have to do this.
[00:24:57.827 --> 00:25:01.829]  You know, the CIA calls up and they say, well, don't sue this group.
[00:25:02.049 --> 00:25:02.689]  We're going to fix it.
[00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:04.590]  OK, we'll see if you're going to fix it.
[00:25:05.351 --> 00:25:08.952]  The point is, is that I'm not going to sit here and take this crap anymore.
[00:25:10.053 --> 00:25:14.915]  From G2 in Boston or any of these other people, we've got all the dirt on you.
[00:25:16.256 --> 00:25:21.318]  And I'm not going to sit here and be deplatformed and unpersoned like the Nazis did to the Jews.
[00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:22.999]  I am not going to take it lying down.
[00:25:23.079 --> 00:25:24.080]  So get that through your head.
[00:25:25.114 --> 00:25:27.575]  So I've got 10 groups we're looking to sue.
[00:25:28.895 --> 00:25:32.196]  And Barnes with his lawyers are going to do it at cost for the filings and things.
[00:25:32.276 --> 00:25:35.738]  Once you get into depositions and all that, it's astronomical the amount of money.
[00:25:37.358 --> 00:25:39.959]  So we're a year behind launching new shows.
[00:25:40.459 --> 00:25:42.880]  We're a couple months behind following the law since we told you we were going to file.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:49.782]  But we're going to do everything we said that we are going to do.
[00:25:50.863 --> 00:25:54.544]  Because I don't know how this is going to end, but they started the fight.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.002]  If they want to fight, they better believe they got one.
[00:25:59.442 --> 00:26:00.183]  It's all on God.
[00:26:00.583 --> 00:26:02.985]  I give it all to God, which really means you.
[00:26:03.405 --> 00:26:04.526]  God works through you.
[00:26:04.606 --> 00:26:05.787]  God works in mysterious ways.
[00:26:05.807 --> 00:26:09.829]  I'm going to cover all the news when we come back, but we're fighting hard here, folks.
[00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:18.335]  Our secret weapon is you, the listeners, prayer, this great crew, and people like Matt Drudge and others that aren't cowards and haven't turned their back on us.
[00:26:21.015 --> 00:26:24.776]  And you really find out who the men are from the boys when things get rough.
[00:26:24.796 --> 00:26:25.837]  That's what's always been said.
[00:26:26.197 --> 00:26:28.458]  When times get rough, you find out who your friends are and who aren't.
[00:26:28.638 --> 00:26:29.958]  You find out who people really are.
[00:26:30.699 --> 00:26:42.843]  We've seen a lot of folks out there that have gotten better under the pressure, like Tucker Carlson, instead of worse under the pressure, like a lot of people we could name, that run for the exits as soon as stuff gets tough.
[00:26:42.883 --> 00:26:44.364]  So, I'm not a victim.
[00:26:44.664 --> 00:26:45.304]  I'm a warrior.
[00:26:45.364 --> 00:26:46.605]  I'm an activist on the front lines.
[00:26:48.171 --> 00:26:50.852]  And I couldn't have done any of this without you, so I'm just going to say this right now.
[00:26:51.572 --> 00:27:05.116]  If you want to bet on your future, if you want to bet on Americana, if you want to bet on not being run by the shycoms, with Senate and House hearings now on how they literally fund the Democrats and MSM and CNN, the Chinese government does.
[00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:06.016]  It's all coming out.
[00:27:07.116 --> 00:27:08.057]  It's so devastating.
[00:27:08.617 --> 00:27:11.477]  And the government isn't even sure how to bring this out.
[00:27:11.497 --> 00:27:13.498]  They're starting to bring it out, going, Democrats, stop!
[00:27:13.758 --> 00:27:14.818]  Democrats aren't going to stop!
[00:27:15.319 --> 00:27:16.619]  They're trying to cause a civil war right now.
[00:27:17.506 --> 00:27:18.787]  Like we're starting to get some purchase.
[00:27:19.468 --> 00:27:20.208]  Try to start a fire?
[00:27:20.248 --> 00:27:21.209]  They got some fire going.
[00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:27.794]  All the physical attacks, shootings, bombings, ice facilities getting attacked, dead people everywhere.
[00:27:28.235 --> 00:27:29.036]  It's on, folks.
[00:27:30.757 --> 00:27:34.160]  And if you think it's bad now, if they really get traction, it's gonna go insane.
[00:27:35.424 --> 00:27:51.181]  So now, more than you've ever done, for yourself, for me, for everybody, spread the word about this broadcast on your local station, radio TV, tell folks about InfoWars.com forward slash show, and let them know, hey, they wanted to shut this guy down because he exposed the Chinese government funding and controlling Hollywood.
[00:27:51.221 --> 00:27:52.883]  You wonder why Hollywood's anti-American?
[00:27:53.183 --> 00:27:55.926]  It's literally owned by the Chinese military.
[00:27:59.412 --> 00:28:01.032]  UT is basically run by China now.
[00:28:01.713 --> 00:28:02.493]  It's unbelievable.
[00:28:02.533 --> 00:28:04.373]  It's all coming out in Senate and House reports.
[00:28:04.633 --> 00:28:05.654]  We'll cover that next hour.
[00:28:06.514 --> 00:28:08.174]  But listen, everybody else is scared.
[00:28:08.614 --> 00:28:10.515]  Everybody else ran for the exits a long time ago.
[00:28:10.835 --> 00:28:18.897]  We knew if we told the truth, bet on you, you'd stand up, you'd see what happened, good people in government would see what happened, and that we would finally get people to take action.
[00:28:19.077 --> 00:28:20.777]  But somebody's got to make that first example.
[00:28:20.938 --> 00:28:22.538]  So I am honored to be in the position.
[00:28:23.663 --> 00:28:23.843]  I've got
[00:28:46.381 --> 00:28:46.441]  Yes.
[00:28:46.461 --> 00:28:59.410]  Storewide free shipping, double patriot points, get all the great products you need, and no, you are funding not just the Second American Revolution, but a pro-human future against the devil-worshipping Satanists and their off-world controllers.
[00:29:07.022 --> 00:29:08.443]  Let's go with Aaron in Alabama.
[00:29:08.463 --> 00:29:09.143]  Thanks for calling, Aaron.
[00:29:09.163 --> 00:29:09.703]  You're on the air.
[00:29:09.823 --> 00:29:10.364]  Hey, Alex.
[00:29:10.464 --> 00:29:14.465]  I want to say I've been in broadcasting, or I was, for about 15 years as a programmer.
[00:29:14.565 --> 00:29:17.027]  And to be honest, I hadn't heard of you until about six months ago.
[00:29:17.067 --> 00:29:18.747]  And I'm very thankful that I found you.
[00:29:18.807 --> 00:29:22.329]  You touch on a lot of stuff that I've felt in my heart and soul for my whole life.
[00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:23.330]  We really are.
[00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.290]  We really are.
[00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:28.033]  And listen, I've got a couple of points to make.
[00:29:28.073 --> 00:29:30.715]  But first, I've had body pain all over my entire life.
[00:29:30.875 --> 00:29:33.156]  And you know the product better than anybody there, I think.
[00:29:33.396 --> 00:29:34.277]  What would you recommend?
[00:29:34.437 --> 00:29:37.079]  I mean, literally, it's joints, it's muscle, it's everything.
[00:29:37.139 --> 00:29:38.920]  What would you recommend to me to purchase?
[00:29:52.489 --> 00:29:52.849]  I don't know.
[00:30:07.705 --> 00:30:13.448]  I think you should go through the products, everybody is different, and test stuff out for yourself, and then just see what works best for you.
[00:30:13.488 --> 00:30:21.533]  But they're all super game-changing, the best we can get, the best labs, the cleanest, just like whatever is the most proven, the best, I go produce it.
[00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:22.173]  That's it.
[00:30:22.193 --> 00:30:25.435]  Because I would, I'm gonna say this again, I'm a very superstitious person.
[00:30:26.215 --> 00:30:27.216]  And by that, I'm God-fearing.
[00:30:27.857 --> 00:30:29.159]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:30:29.199 --> 00:30:30.260]  You've got my total commitment.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.964]  Anything I do, information, any of it, of products.
[00:30:34.044 --> 00:30:37.508]  Like, they went out and tested, third parties did, Alexa Pure and Pro Pure.
[00:30:37.648 --> 00:30:39.070]  Some are better at this, some are better at that.
[00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:43.234]  People are like, wow, we tested 30 gravity-fed filters and you have, like, the two best.
[00:30:43.515 --> 00:30:44.496]  Why'd I do that?
[00:30:44.636 --> 00:30:46.178]  What the hell do you think I'm doing?
[00:30:46.258 --> 00:30:49.501]  I go out and find out what is the best price for the best quality.
[00:30:49.521 --> 00:30:52.704]  Cause there's always like some space age $5,000 thing that's better.
[00:30:52.725 --> 00:30:55.808]  But I look at a line of like, what is the lowest price for the best benefit?
[00:30:55.928 --> 00:30:57.229]  And that's what I promote.
[00:30:57.329 --> 00:30:59.111]  So, so that's my advice on that.
[00:30:59.211 --> 00:30:59.492]  Go ahead.
[00:30:59.512 --> 00:30:59.712]  Sorry.
[00:31:00.092 --> 00:31:06.435]  Well, and I appreciate that, and I can tell just from the way you talk about the product, I feel like I can trust you that you kind of do things the way I do.
[00:31:06.475 --> 00:31:08.396]  You either do it right the first time, or just don't do it.
[00:31:08.517 --> 00:31:10.578]  And I feel like I can trust you on your product.
[00:31:10.638 --> 00:31:17.201]  Well, listen, don't trust me, because here's the deal, is you need to talk to a physician, you need to research, because the iodine conspiracy is everything.
[00:31:17.421 --> 00:31:22.004]  Most people have almost none of it, but if you've had none of it for 20 years, you take a bunch, you could have some issues.
[00:31:22.164 --> 00:31:23.324]  Detoxing, you name it.
[00:31:23.384 --> 00:31:26.046]  I mean, this stuff, this is it, man.
[00:31:26.186 --> 00:31:27.587]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[00:31:27.727 --> 00:31:28.347]  It's dangerous.
[00:31:28.567 --> 00:31:31.248]  Because it's an element you've got to have, they've taken away from you.
[00:31:31.328 --> 00:31:33.189]  Well, what happens when you finally get it?
[00:31:33.229 --> 00:31:33.929]  You've got to be careful.
[00:31:33.989 --> 00:31:37.811]  Because if you've not had this, your body will take in bromine, chloride, fluoride.
[00:31:37.891 --> 00:31:39.411]  There's a whole bunch of bad halogens.
[00:31:40.612 --> 00:31:42.132]  Your organs, everything operates.
[00:31:42.332 --> 00:31:44.473]  Your hormones are produced with halogen.
[00:31:44.593 --> 00:31:48.195]  And so the globalists have been targeting that with bad halogens that block it.
[00:31:48.255 --> 00:31:49.215]  So this is the good thing.
[00:31:49.255 --> 00:31:52.216]  But like anybody knows, it's like being punched in the kick in the head by a mule.
[00:31:52.236 --> 00:31:53.497]  It's like, oh, that's the real thing.
[00:31:53.537 --> 00:31:54.397]  Yeah, that's the mule.
[00:31:54.537 --> 00:31:56.418]  So I'm just telling people, this X2 isn't a joke.
[00:31:56.578 --> 00:31:58.200]  We just researched what the globalists are doing.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.161]  We do the opposite.
[00:31:59.201 --> 00:32:04.908]  But yes, everyone with X2, X3, you need to consult a physician, because you're like, oh, that's just Mother Nature.
[00:32:04.968 --> 00:32:05.929]  Yeah, Mother Nature.
[00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:10.054]  The drug companies and all the stuff they do is a counterfeit of what God's already given us, okay?
[00:32:10.094 --> 00:32:10.855]  So let me explain it again.
[00:32:11.616 --> 00:32:13.058]  Iodine, you die.
[00:32:13.078 --> 00:32:14.639]  The fields are depleted.
[00:32:14.779 --> 00:32:15.560]  Everything's depleted.
[00:32:15.741 --> 00:32:21.247]  Most iodine is bound to iron or copper or lead or something else.
[00:32:21.307 --> 00:32:22.147]  You don't get it.
[00:32:22.248 --> 00:32:24.870]  Pure iodine is explosive.
[00:32:25.131 --> 00:32:26.152]  So yeah, be careful.
[00:32:26.312 --> 00:32:27.613]  Iodine, you have to have.
[00:32:28.334 --> 00:32:30.076]  It's just paramount.
[00:32:30.677 --> 00:32:32.539]  And so, that's why we sell it.
[00:32:32.599 --> 00:32:36.102]  That's why we've hyped it up, because it's what they don't want you to have.
[00:32:36.142 --> 00:32:45.372]  But yeah, if you've been off of it and not had an eye on it for your whole life, it's like if you've ever been in a boxing ring and you get the ring with Mike Tyson, your body's gonna be like, what the hell is that?
[00:32:45.672 --> 00:32:46.953]  Because you've never had it.
[00:32:47.173 --> 00:32:48.074]  It's just iodine.
[00:32:48.134 --> 00:32:49.875]  It's the magic sauce, folks.
[00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:52.837]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:32:52.977 --> 00:32:56.759]  Thank you for shopping and getting great products, and it helps fund this operation.
[00:32:56.899 --> 00:32:59.521]  A total 360 win, and you know I love those.
[00:33:06.906 --> 00:33:09.568]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.419 --> 00:33:26.341]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:26.601 --> 00:33:33.563]  Alright, let's launch right into it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:34.243 --> 00:33:44.005]  On the Russiagate front, the fact that Mueller lied, the fact that Strzok lied, the fact that all of them were in a conspiracy to frame the President is coming out.
[00:33:44.724 --> 00:33:54.766]  There is an entire stack of news and information on that front that we are going to be getting to here today.
[00:33:55.406 --> 00:33:56.566]  We obviously have the huge news.
[00:33:56.626 --> 00:34:01.648]  Pakistan warns of war after India's move to end Kashmir's special status.
[00:34:02.408 --> 00:34:09.649]  Special status is Pakistan's cutting it away with the Chinese and ethnically cleansing Hindus and other folks.
[00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:12.070]  So it's just absolutely horrible.
[00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.030]  And Modi
[00:34:14.142 --> 00:34:18.324]  After 140 million dead Hindus that Islamic Hands is not putting up with it.
[00:34:18.884 --> 00:34:20.385]  Gotta admire the fighting spirit.
[00:34:21.245 --> 00:34:25.066]  Both countries have over 100 hydrogen bombs and are threatening to nuke each other right now.
[00:34:25.887 --> 00:34:27.207]  This is a proxy war with China.
[00:34:27.287 --> 00:34:29.788]  Like I said, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:32.409]  We're gonna be breaking that down.
[00:34:32.769 --> 00:34:38.092]  We're gonna be breaking down the incredible developments on the mass shootings and the way the media has been handling that.
[00:34:38.152 --> 00:34:41.253]  And then more on Amazon's Alexa.
[00:34:42.834 --> 00:34:58.170]  And Google's assistant and all of these major systems are listening to you in your house and they're primed when they hear sex terms to particularly record you having sex with your wife or husband.
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:05.844]  And doggone it, I'm sitting there this morning and I look over and there's the damn phone on the nightstand.
[00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:18.032]  I mean, think about how we just bring these Trojan horses into your house and you look over and you're having sex with your wife and there's a robot sitting right there listening to you.
[00:35:18.112 --> 00:35:19.033]  And you know it's listening.
[00:35:19.914 --> 00:35:29.861]  And even Alex Jones is so stupid and so habituated that I can't even control myself and keep the damn robot away.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.642]  You imagine the intelligence power that the globalists get?
[00:35:33.662 --> 00:35:37.384]  And you know, I don't tell those type of stories to be crass here.
[00:35:39.245 --> 00:35:45.928]  I tell it because I want you to think about what we've done and what we've put up with and how insane this has gotten.
[00:35:47.549 --> 00:35:54.012]  Amazon Alexa captured audio of people having sex sends those reports back to the HQ Newsweek.
[00:35:54.933 --> 00:35:58.815]  I told you that about smart TVs and
[00:36:00.862 --> 00:36:04.004]  The video cams on Apple computers 20 years ago.
[00:36:05.285 --> 00:36:11.330]  Amazon forced to give Alexa users the option to stop staff listening to recordings of them having sex.
[00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.611]  They now have a flag button you click.
[00:36:14.392 --> 00:36:15.633]  Hey, you think Jeff Bezos?
[00:36:17.034 --> 00:36:21.677]  You think Jeff Bezos has an Alexa on his yacht?
[00:36:22.598 --> 00:36:24.800]  You think Jeff Bezos has one in his bedroom?
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.381]  You can bet he doesn't.
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:40.545]  And I'm not even blaming Jeff Bezos here, because of all the big tech guys, he's, you know, actually works with our country, and, you know, I mean, Google's helping run death camps, basically, in China.
[00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:45.706]  I mean, Apple gave all the code keys to the Chinese government last year, and admitted it, and said, well, that's what you do when you move to China.
[00:36:45.947 --> 00:36:47.507]  Yeah, they have the keys to everybody's iPhone.
[00:36:49.128 --> 00:36:53.329]  But let me just take Bezos, since he's the one in the news about this, all these assistants to it.
[00:36:53.689 --> 00:36:54.730]  Their argument is, well,
[00:36:56.357 --> 00:37:00.518]  Everybody is just doing this, so we've got to do it, too, to get our market share.
[00:37:01.218 --> 00:37:07.340]  So you go to Whole Foods, it says on the side of the free bag they give you, because, you know, Austin banned plastic bags.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.721]  So they have the bags that you've got to buy if you forgot a bag.
[00:37:10.001 --> 00:37:13.502]  And it says, oh, Alexa, order my avocados.
[00:37:16.683 --> 00:37:18.263]  That's at my house, by the way.
[00:37:18.283 --> 00:37:24.105]  I mean, I've got a bag from Whole Foods, and it's like, I'm looking at it, and it says, hey, Alexa, order me
[00:37:25.973 --> 00:37:27.513]  Avocados and have them delivered to my house.
[00:37:30.294 --> 00:37:33.475]  But see, it's also, listen to me, having sex with my wife.
[00:37:35.435 --> 00:37:36.835]  But see, oh, Alexa isn't in my house.
[00:37:36.875 --> 00:37:38.496]  But let me tell you what's been in your house, folks.
[00:37:39.136 --> 00:37:50.398]  The Phones and the Telecommunications Act of 96 said that by law, they're triangulated by satellite and cell tower for location.
[00:37:51.505 --> 00:37:55.207]  And they can be remotely turned on, even when off, to listen to you.
[00:37:55.947 --> 00:37:56.848]  The FBI asked for that.
[00:37:56.888 --> 00:38:05.152]  So see, the FBI, our domestic security force, lobbied to have all phones in the future.
[00:38:05.793 --> 00:38:06.753]  Talk about visionaries, 1996.
[00:38:06.793 --> 00:38:07.133]  By 2000, all phones.
[00:38:13.237 --> 00:38:14.598]  Would be remotely accessible.
[00:38:15.278 --> 00:38:16.639]  That's why the headlines are out.
[00:38:16.859 --> 00:38:20.361]  One text to your iPhone turns on the microphone.
[00:38:20.441 --> 00:38:21.321]  Hackers found out.
[00:38:21.441 --> 00:38:21.861]  Yeah!
[00:38:22.582 --> 00:38:25.083]  Because the system built all these back doors.
[00:38:25.123 --> 00:38:27.124]  So, yeah, Jeff Bezos is doing this too.
[00:38:27.644 --> 00:38:29.845]  Jeff Bezos is doing it in 2019.
[00:38:30.265 --> 00:38:31.466]  Because that's the architecture.
[00:38:32.026 --> 00:38:33.207]  Like a plug in the wall.
[00:38:36.329 --> 00:38:37.169]  Like a plug in the wall.
[00:38:39.471 --> 00:38:40.672]  It's like, well, why do we have a plug in the wall?
[00:38:40.692 --> 00:38:41.533]  Well, that's standardized.
[00:38:41.813 --> 00:38:43.074]  Why are the power lines there?
[00:38:43.374 --> 00:38:44.936]  Why are the street signs green?
[00:38:45.516 --> 00:38:47.218]  Because it was all standardized.
[00:38:49.299 --> 00:38:53.963]  You know, the metric system, the... And now, we're here.
[00:38:55.165 --> 00:39:03.111]  And it's just part of the system that all these devices, and now they're coming out with refrigerators.
[00:39:04.192 --> 00:39:05.193]  And coffee makers.
[00:39:06.034 --> 00:39:07.075]  And washing machines.
[00:39:08.871 --> 00:39:12.712]  And you try to go and buy new washing machines.
[00:39:13.973 --> 00:39:15.513]  And they don't have the old-fashioned ones that work.
[00:39:15.533 --> 00:39:22.055]  They've got all these fancy ones with all this computerized crap in it that never works and breaks constantly because it's listening to you.
[00:39:23.055 --> 00:39:23.736]  And how do I know that?
[00:39:24.836 --> 00:39:30.138]  The CIA director at the time, ten years ago, said, your dishwasher is listening to you.
[00:39:32.978 --> 00:39:35.259]  They've got microphones on.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:36.940]  And you ask,
[00:39:38.274 --> 00:39:39.215]  Why do you need a microphone?
[00:39:40.095 --> 00:39:55.704]  Why did Scientific Atlantic Cableboxes, when I was first told about this 20 years ago by a high-level engineer who'd worked for the NSA and major corporations, he said, because they're already listening to everybody and they're training the AI on voice print and voice recognition for the rollout.
[00:39:55.924 --> 00:39:59.806]  And I broke one open on AXS TV in like 1998 and then
[00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:10.111]  As best I could tell, they started having the army follow me around for a while.
[00:40:11.331 --> 00:40:12.711]  And I said, go ahead, do whatever you're going to do.
[00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:13.472]  I'm not going to shut up.
[00:40:14.292 --> 00:40:16.772]  But see, back then, that was a big national security secret.
[00:40:18.213 --> 00:40:24.174]  The Time Warner cable boxes nationwide had a microphone in them and were listening to every damn thing you said.
[00:40:25.254 --> 00:40:32.836]  That was over 15 years before people now know to talk, do voice, and talk to the cable box.
[00:40:33.803 --> 00:40:35.483]  Now it's like, oh my kill box, I talked the whole time.
[00:40:35.723 --> 00:40:36.263]  Exactly!
[00:40:37.324 --> 00:40:43.125]  But when I told you it was listening to you 22 years ago, man, time's flying.
[00:40:45.005 --> 00:40:46.205]  Oh, I'm that cook.
[00:40:46.625 --> 00:40:48.066]  Oh, I'm that bad guy.
[00:40:48.086 --> 00:40:57.447]  You know, I saw an AP report about how nice these emergency centers are for all the immigrants to process them.
[00:40:57.507 --> 00:40:59.348]  And all these pieces came together yesterday.
[00:41:00.788 --> 00:41:01.728]  And I went and looked it up.
[00:41:02.918 --> 00:41:04.519]  And sure enough, there it all was.
[00:41:05.019 --> 00:41:06.520]  And sure enough, we were right.
[00:41:09.181 --> 00:41:15.385]  And it was that key piece of evidence that now they're willing to admit that I'd never reported on.
[00:41:15.405 --> 00:41:18.406]  So let me just tell you that piece of news right now, because I'm just gonna be all over the map today.
[00:41:19.607 --> 00:41:30.953]  We had listeners freaking out all over Texas, all over Florida, all over New Mexico, all over Arizona, all over California, saying, listen, they're closing Walmarts.
[00:41:31.997 --> 00:41:35.500]  And they're building basically containment areas, showers.
[00:41:36.781 --> 00:41:38.423]  They are putting in all this stuff.
[00:41:39.944 --> 00:41:43.187]  And then when we cover it, they'd say it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:41:43.447 --> 00:41:45.288]  And we're like, are they concentration camps?
[00:41:45.609 --> 00:41:46.910]  Which the Democrats are now calling them.
[00:41:48.114 --> 00:41:59.779]  Because for whatever reason, when Obama was building these to process the people they were saying come to the U.S., back then they were even a little more reasonable ten years ago, they were going to get the criminals out of the group and ship them back.
[00:41:59.839 --> 00:42:00.880]  But you've got to process people.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.882]  So Obama wanted to bring in replacement labor, new voting population.
[00:42:05.542 --> 00:42:09.024]  They were going to, but they did say, well what do we got in the Southwest?
[00:42:09.064 --> 00:42:09.884]  What do we got in Texas?
[00:42:10.104 --> 00:42:12.045]  We've got a bunch of older Walmarts we can close.
[00:42:12.485 --> 00:42:14.066]  Walmart's opening Super Walmarts.
[00:42:14.546 --> 00:42:16.147]  And so Walmart did this deal.
[00:42:18.968 --> 00:42:24.909]  Special Forces was involved, the Army was involved as a national security emergency as Rex 84, but under Obama.
[00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:33.751]  And now I'm watching a Navy report and it's like, these are converted Walmarts that in the last decade were turned into emergency centers in case we had this crisis.
[00:42:36.871 --> 00:42:38.691]  And I'm going, wow, bingo, we were right.
[00:42:39.451 --> 00:42:48.033]  Because people are like, the people working in them are like, yeah, we're putting showers in and toilets and there are locked up areas and some areas are like jail cells for criminals that are caught.
[00:42:48.993 --> 00:42:53.356]  And we go, hey, Walmart's putting jails in, and it turns out it's all true!
[00:42:55.157 --> 00:42:56.118]  It's incredible!
[00:42:56.998 --> 00:42:57.659]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:03.322 --> 00:43:13.049]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on air 25 years, and I've never, at a gut level, felt the fire of war.
[00:43:14.033 --> 00:43:16.558]  Like I do right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.363]  So many incredible things are happening.
[00:43:20.004 --> 00:43:21.827]  So many dangerous things are unfolding.
[00:43:22.449 --> 00:43:25.714]  And at a cellular level, at a spiritual gut level.
[00:43:27.082 --> 00:43:44.998]  At the heart of my gut, the heart of my mind, at every level, I can just feel the evil rage of the globalists, knowing that their plan for world government, and their plan for total censorship, and their plan for human-animal clones, and sex with children, and Satanism is in trouble.
[00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:48.402]  It can feel the spirit of Christ coming back into the world.
[00:43:48.522 --> 00:43:49.583]  There's gonna be a tribulation.
[00:43:50.123 --> 00:43:53.445]  During this fight, the devil knows he's going to lose.
[00:43:53.706 --> 00:43:57.168]  The devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows his time is short.
[00:43:57.288 --> 00:43:59.590]  And I can feel Satan's rage.
[00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:00.590]  I know you can feel it.
[00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:02.592]  And they are planning a bloody revolution here.
[00:44:02.752 --> 00:44:05.614]  They're planning massive censorship across the country and the world.
[00:44:05.694 --> 00:44:09.277]  This is a time to be praying to Christ for justice and for freedom.
[00:44:09.397 --> 00:44:12.239]  And that God's spirit come into you and lead God and direct you.
[00:44:12.279 --> 00:44:15.281]  But it's also time to be politically and culturally active.
[00:44:15.441 --> 00:44:27.384]  And it's time to spread the word about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and override the AI sensors to override their systems and to let people know, hey, here's the name that must not be spoken.
[00:44:27.644 --> 00:44:28.884]  Here's what the world fears.
[00:44:29.084 --> 00:44:34.785]  Here's the guest and the information and the history and the analysis that is the cure to the globalist poison.
[00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:35.686]  InfoWars.
[00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:39.767]  Strength lies entirely with you and the action you take.
[00:44:40.007 --> 00:44:41.347]  You are the InfoWars.
[00:44:41.587 --> 00:44:48.009]  You are the resistance, and everything you do now will affect the battle space for billions of lives going to the future.
[00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:51.071]  The war has already begun, to quote Patrick Henry.
[00:44:51.611 --> 00:44:53.251]  It's an information and spiritual war.
[00:44:54.132 --> 00:44:56.833]  The enemy's losing that war, so they want to make it a physical war.
[00:44:57.393 --> 00:44:58.553]  So prepare yourselves.
[00:44:59.214 --> 00:44:59.974]  You have been warned.
[00:45:02.755 --> 00:45:06.776]  Let's go to James in Massachusetts.
[00:45:07.156 --> 00:45:07.817]  James, you're on the air.
[00:45:07.837 --> 00:45:08.397]  Thanks for calling.
[00:45:10.115 --> 00:45:11.076]  Hello, Alex.
[00:45:11.316 --> 00:45:13.177]  God bless General Jones.
[00:45:13.237 --> 00:45:15.418]  May you live in peace and love forever.
[00:45:15.478 --> 00:45:16.519]  In Christ's name, we pray.
[00:45:16.639 --> 00:45:17.380]  God bless you, brother.
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:18.880]  And I'd like to thank you also.
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.222]  You know, my wife and I have been married for 17 years, and we were never able to have kids.
[00:45:22.323 --> 00:45:31.428]  And after a couple years of taking the B12 and the iodine, and knowing about not using fluoride and not having vaccines, we have a great, healthy, vibrant, six-year-old boy.
[00:45:31.568 --> 00:45:32.829]  And I thank you very much for that.
[00:45:33.029 --> 00:45:35.611]  Well, you know, fluoride is meant to block fertility.
[00:45:36.072 --> 00:45:39.054]  It's the bad halogen, but iodine is associated with fertility.
[00:45:39.514 --> 00:45:40.615]  So that's a beautiful story.
[00:45:40.635 --> 00:45:41.656]  That's exciting, my friend.
[00:45:41.796 --> 00:45:46.000]  And I've got all the articles right here about IQ, fertility, being boosted on iodine.
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:47.021]  You name it.
[00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:51.344]  That's why the system fights to keep people from getting good iodine and other things that we talk about here.
[00:45:51.404 --> 00:45:53.646]  Even though you don't get it from InfoWarsTore.com, it doesn't matter to me.
[00:45:53.706 --> 00:45:55.988]  Just research what deficiencies are doing.
[00:45:56.128 --> 00:45:59.271]  But get back to you and your wife and recap the story you were telling.
[00:45:59.451 --> 00:46:23.000]  So we've been married for 17 years and we never had any children and we bought the water filter first and we got out the fluoride and the glyphosate and then we started taking X2 and B12 and about a year or so later my wife got pregnant with our baby boy and with the iodine that she was taking and everything he's so bright and you can just see the glow in his face and he's always smiling and we just owe it all to you and you're our hero Alex.
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.462]  Well, that's just beautiful, brother.
[00:46:24.762 --> 00:46:27.905]  And again, it shows the system knows all this.
[00:46:28.246 --> 00:46:32.591]  And it works to keep the people from just getting basic things the body has to have.
[00:46:32.631 --> 00:46:35.174]  You have to have vitamin C. You have to have iodine.
[00:46:35.514 --> 00:46:36.375]  You have to have water.
[00:46:36.695 --> 00:46:37.677]  You have to have oxygen.
[00:46:38.097 --> 00:46:40.438]  Instead, the whole system works to block that.
[00:46:40.558 --> 00:46:41.598]  It's just so powerful.
[00:46:41.678 --> 00:46:42.738]  It's what we're made of.
[00:46:42.879 --> 00:46:45.159]  And I'm sitting here trying to explain this to people.
[00:46:45.179 --> 00:46:46.580]  We're not just making this stuff up.
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:47.840]  It's just everything.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.761]  But again, the other iodines are bound.
[00:46:49.781 --> 00:46:50.901]  You don't absorb them.
[00:46:51.321 --> 00:46:52.742]  Everyone calls their iodine atomic.
[00:46:52.982 --> 00:46:55.422]  I wish everyone else was selling atomic iodine.
[00:46:55.522 --> 00:46:55.903]  They're not.
[00:46:56.083 --> 00:46:57.723]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA2533139.
[00:47:06.312 --> 00:47:10.835]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:22.043 --> 00:47:31.429]  When the bullet hits the bone, I'm Alex Jones, your host, waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:47:35.136 --> 00:48:03.167]  I'm gonna post this congressional testimony at Infowars.com and then at the bottom of the next hour I'm gonna cover it on how the Chinese government controls the universities, Hollywood, and the Democratic Party.
[00:48:04.833 --> 00:48:09.236]  And this is congressional testimony of the National Endowment for Democracy.
[00:48:09.837 --> 00:48:13.039]  Now, who's the National Endowment for Democracy?
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:24.887]  It's the voice of the major foundations that admit their world government plan is in shambles, and that the Chinese have double dealt, and that it's over.
[00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:30.131]  It gets its funding from the Department of State, the U.S.
[00:48:30.211 --> 00:48:31.512]  Agency for International Development,
[00:48:32.847 --> 00:48:36.368]  And it's subject to congressional oversight as a non-governmental organization.
[00:48:37.329 --> 00:48:38.989]  It gets $135 million a year.
[00:48:39.009 --> 00:48:43.091]  And then it goes into the United States Information Agency.
[00:48:45.532 --> 00:48:46.912]  That's above the CIA.
[00:48:48.693 --> 00:48:49.633]  And what are they saying?
[00:48:50.213 --> 00:48:52.574]  Well, you might want to go read the report.
[00:48:52.614 --> 00:48:58.036]  I'm going to get one of the guys to post both that information from the National Endowment for Democracy who funds them.
[00:48:58.376 --> 00:48:59.517]  It's the voice of the government.
[00:49:00.322 --> 00:49:07.487]  The voice of the real deep state, the deep, deep state, and the actual report.
[00:49:08.608 --> 00:49:14.533]  This is all going to get posted on Infowars.com and Newswars.com in the next 10-15 minutes.
[00:49:15.133 --> 00:49:20.617]  You want to go read this congressional report for yourself, because you're going to read it and go, is that a transcript of the Alex Jones Show?
[00:49:22.399 --> 00:49:29.444]  No, it's, we're taking our government back, they made a deal to sell us out to China completely and collapse us, and that deal's been revoked.
[00:49:30.811 --> 00:49:31.992]  Piss up a rope, New World Order.
[00:49:33.053 --> 00:49:34.674]  Telling you, this is unbelievable.
[00:49:34.694 --> 00:49:36.195]  This is just happening right now.
[00:49:38.257 --> 00:49:42.380]  This testimony... We need to pull this testimony from C-SPAN.
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.061]  We need to air this.
[00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:46.924]  I mean, this... This is coffin nails, the New World Order, folks.
[00:49:46.964 --> 00:49:49.006]  This is... This is gold.
[00:49:50.767 --> 00:49:51.348]  That's coming up.
[00:49:53.149 --> 00:49:55.711]  And like I said, I just digressed from something I noticed yesterday.
[00:49:55.731 --> 00:49:57.092]  I didn't even prepare it for the show.
[00:49:57.192 --> 00:49:58.974]  I can get you the report where AP's saying,
[00:49:59.895 --> 00:50:06.181]  In the last decade, they converted all these Walmarts in the Southwest in case emergency migrant waves came in.
[00:50:07.162 --> 00:50:15.730]  Well, yeah, because Obama knew they were triggering it, and the UN was building the refugee centers in Central and South America, and building up to this, and then they handed Trump the problem.
[00:50:16.571 --> 00:50:17.933]  But all those Walmarts
[00:50:19.525 --> 00:50:34.195]  That we would have guests on saying, listen Alex, I'm a truck driver, I delivered the sheetrock in there, and they're building toilets, and they've got jail cells, and part of it's like open living areas, part of it's jail areas, because yeah, you're processing people, there's gonna be criminals.
[00:50:34.835 --> 00:50:44.142]  The point is, is that they, this has all been built, and so all the people saying Walmarts are being converted to some type of jail facility, it's true!
[00:50:46.448 --> 00:50:46.708]  I don't know.
[00:51:06.516 --> 00:51:16.180]  We had callers from Alabama and Florida and truck drivers and construction workers that would, you know, travel to Texas and give me a file and say, I've been working at three Walmarts last year.
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:16.800]  I'm a foreman.
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:23.103]  But they are putting in areas with fences and areas for living areas and families.
[00:51:23.603 --> 00:51:24.823]  Who do you think this is for?
[00:51:25.644 --> 00:51:27.344]  And I'm like, I have no damn idea.
[00:51:28.265 --> 00:51:31.046]  Because Obama was planning to collapse the economy, start race wars.
[00:51:31.066 --> 00:51:31.946]  We got those documents.
[00:51:32.366 --> 00:51:33.667]  We were like, oh, it's for us.
[00:51:35.506 --> 00:51:35.726]  No.
[00:51:36.506 --> 00:51:52.830]  It was Democrat Party officials given the hundreds of millions in contracts to run these now private facilities, and then they caused the crisis, tell the illegals to come here, and then blame Trump when they're in facilities that the Democrats are making the money off of!
[00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:54.331]  And that's all been confirmed!
[00:51:55.151 --> 00:52:00.252]  All these facilities, it turns out, Democrat donors own the lease on and own the building.
[00:52:02.403 --> 00:52:08.545]  And then the Border Patrol sent in there with all this lavish care and taking care of everybody with all these aides.
[00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:12.606]  They have one aide for every five people in there.
[00:52:13.447 --> 00:52:14.187]  AP showed it.
[00:52:14.247 --> 00:52:20.309]  It's like Candace Owens went to these and said, this is nicer than where my kids or my cousins would ever go to school.
[00:52:22.159 --> 00:52:25.442]  But imagine the Patriots, our listeners, are in these Walmarts building this.
[00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:26.603]  They're told keep quiet.
[00:52:27.684 --> 00:52:28.765]  They're calling in freaking out.
[00:52:29.325 --> 00:52:30.226]  Well now we know.
[00:52:30.906 --> 00:52:32.608]  Obama was triggering the whole thing.
[00:52:33.128 --> 00:52:34.730]  And it's in the AP report.
[00:52:37.412 --> 00:52:38.793]  I just sprung this on them last segment.
[00:52:39.194 --> 00:52:40.194]  This wasn't all pre-planned.
[00:52:40.234 --> 00:52:42.156]  I just remembered this was telling the story.
[00:52:42.536 --> 00:52:47.501]  Where they admit, oh, Walmarts were converted in the last decade by Obama.
[00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:50.130]  We're good to go.
[00:53:14.352 --> 00:53:15.712]  Mr. Jones, here's a photo.
[00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:17.233]  Some areas are like for families.
[00:53:17.313 --> 00:53:20.454]  Bunk beds, kitchens, everything.
[00:53:20.514 --> 00:53:22.054]  It's next to a soccer field.
[00:53:22.074 --> 00:53:23.335]  They're putting in soccer fields.
[00:53:23.775 --> 00:53:25.555]  They're putting up barbed wire around that.
[00:53:25.575 --> 00:53:28.356]  And then they got jail cell areas and shackles.
[00:53:28.416 --> 00:53:29.977]  And I don't know what it is.
[00:53:31.077 --> 00:53:34.938]  That's where they'll separate the patriot men and ship us to the death camp.
[00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:37.319]  And then the women and children will be in this area.
[00:53:37.919 --> 00:53:40.320]  And we got FEMA documents that even admitted plans for that.
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:45.603]  With social security numbers, now they process the resistors, so they do have it as dual use.
[00:53:46.764 --> 00:53:51.928]  So when the Democrats call these concentration camps, it's because they have a dual use for that for us!
[00:53:53.229 --> 00:54:04.897]  And so yesterday I was re-watching that Candace Owens piece, where we put video over what she said she saw with the AP, and it was like click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[00:54:05.398 --> 00:54:06.679]  All the tumblers went into place.
[00:54:08.234 --> 00:54:22.619]  Because imagine, you're an InfoWars listener, and the military's running, Walmart refurbishing, and saying, keep your mouth shut, you're signing nondisclosures, and you're putting in these security facilities that look like jails.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:27.541]  Because they are, people are there illegally, and we've got to process them.
[00:54:27.561 --> 00:54:31.483]  But 90% are being released, so they're not concentration camps, they're not death camps.
[00:54:33.504 --> 00:54:34.464]  But, they could be.
[00:54:35.524 --> 00:54:36.145]  And who built them?
[00:54:36.505 --> 00:54:36.885]  Obama.
[00:54:38.689 --> 00:54:47.933]  Obama built these emergency centers, and when Trump saw them two and a half years ago, it's on record, he flipped out, got more funding, and said, clean this up.
[00:54:50.155 --> 00:54:54.216]  That's because Democratic contractors were stealing all the money and not providing the services.
[00:54:54.477 --> 00:54:56.738]  That's why there were kids sitting in their feces.
[00:54:57.998 --> 00:54:59.979]  Elijah Cummings is talking about four-year-old video.
[00:55:00.219 --> 00:55:01.680]  That's Barack Obama!
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:05.502]  Just like the Democrats run all the cities like that, because they're stealing the money!
[00:55:07.967 --> 00:55:09.528]  You think Trump runs stuff?
[00:55:09.868 --> 00:55:12.110]  Has kids sitting in their feces?
[00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:14.071]  Like Elijah Cummings said, no.
[00:55:16.013 --> 00:55:17.694]  So this is a big bombshell development.
[00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:33.345]  This is a live show, but in post, have Marcos or somebody, I gave you guys the report, you found it, add some of the Walmart clips from 10 years ago, 8 years ago, and then we'll add the AP saying, oh, these were refurbished Walmarts, which again, they put fences around them.
[00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:35.190]  They've got docking bays.
[00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:36.771]  They've got jail cells.
[00:55:37.051 --> 00:55:38.311]  They've got family living areas.
[00:55:38.351 --> 00:55:39.111]  They've got kitchens.
[00:55:39.151 --> 00:55:40.472]  They look like a prison!
[00:55:41.332 --> 00:55:42.792]  Because they are dual use.
[00:55:42.852 --> 00:55:43.693]  They are a prison.
[00:55:45.113 --> 00:55:47.654]  A nice one, but still a nice gilded cage.
[00:55:50.174 --> 00:55:51.315]  We did our job again.
[00:55:51.755 --> 00:55:53.275]  We didn't know exactly what was going on.
[00:55:57.256 --> 00:56:00.317]  I later had some folks in the Army come visit.
[00:56:01.564 --> 00:56:08.109]  And they said, all we know is, we understand that stuff can be used for bad Alex, but it's really just used for collapse of civilization, which I understand as well.
[00:56:08.129 --> 00:56:09.110]  And that's what they were being told.
[00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:10.251]  Hey, don't scare people.
[00:56:10.731 --> 00:56:12.612]  This is for collapsing border.
[00:56:12.632 --> 00:56:16.675]  This is for a migrant surge, which Obama was engineering with Soros and the UN.
[00:56:16.916 --> 00:56:20.298]  The military's just there in plain clothes, making sure everybody keeps their mouth shut.
[00:56:20.458 --> 00:56:20.959]  I get that.
[00:56:20.979 --> 00:56:21.999]  I'm not saying they're villains.
[00:56:22.199 --> 00:56:22.840]  In fact, they're not.
[00:56:23.841 --> 00:56:26.623]  But they had all the intel at the time and did not give it to us.
[00:56:28.737 --> 00:56:36.705]  And so I ran around going, hey, I've had like 10 different contractors on that say they're building damn prisons, and they're not lying.
[00:56:37.666 --> 00:56:44.713]  And I've had them visit me with tears in their eyes, scared, with their wife in the parking lot coming in, giving me videos they shot, going, am I going to get hurt?
[00:56:45.073 --> 00:56:45.894]  Army's running this.
[00:56:46.295 --> 00:56:47.776]  All I know is it's what you said.
[00:56:48.236 --> 00:56:50.439]  And I'm going, I don't know what the hell's going on.
[00:56:55.757 --> 00:56:57.198]  It's the way this stuff clicks now.
[00:56:57.338 --> 00:56:58.820]  Everything's coming into focus right now.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:56:59.860]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:57:03.303 --> 00:57:04.444]  I want to take a lot of calls, too.
[00:57:05.645 --> 00:57:07.046]  I haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:57:07.066 --> 00:57:07.927]  There's so much news.
[00:57:08.287 --> 00:57:09.468]  It'll make your head explode.
[00:57:09.488 --> 00:57:11.890]  But I'm going to try my best next hour.
[00:57:13.251 --> 00:57:16.754]  Please don't forget, without your financial support, plus these are great products you already need, we won't be here.
[00:57:17.254 --> 00:57:18.635]  We have the Banniversary Sale.
[00:57:18.695 --> 00:57:21.117]  It's an extension of last week's Mega Sale.
[00:57:21.157 --> 00:57:22.418]  Some of the water filters have sold out.
[00:57:22.438 --> 00:57:23.419]  A lot of other stuff is selling out.
[00:57:25.299 --> 00:57:29.880]  Everything's 50 60% off store wide free shipping double paid reappoints while supplies last.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.540]  And I've got to end this special soon.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.101]  You've got to try real red pill.
[00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:35.681]  Plus, if you don't know what it does for you, read about it.
[00:57:35.701 --> 00:57:38.041]  50% off all the storeable food and so much more.
[00:57:38.061 --> 00:57:40.202]  50% off Ultra 12.
[00:57:40.442 --> 00:57:42.022]  That's already the now the best sellers.
[00:57:42.042 --> 00:57:43.202]  People use it, love it so much.
[00:57:44.302 --> 00:57:46.363]  Infowarsstore.com or triple 8 2 5 3 3 1 3 9.
[00:57:48.403 --> 00:57:49.923]  Hour number 2 straight ahead.
[00:57:56.098 --> 00:57:57.299]  William in Florida.
[00:57:57.860 --> 00:57:58.781]  William, you're on the air.
[00:57:58.821 --> 00:57:59.181]  Go ahead.
[00:57:59.261 --> 00:58:00.002]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:58:00.062 --> 00:58:00.963]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:58:01.043 --> 00:58:01.724]  Thanks for calling.
[00:58:01.744 --> 00:58:04.427]  Before I get into my points, I want to plug a couple of products.
[00:58:04.487 --> 00:58:05.828]  First off, the Immune Wall.
[00:58:05.848 --> 00:58:06.969]  You don't mention it very much.
[00:58:07.009 --> 00:58:08.231]  It helps keep me healthy.
[00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:13.436]  I work in an environment where I'm exposed to the public, and of course, you know, everything that comes along with that.
[00:58:13.456 --> 00:58:14.217]  I stay healthy with that.
[00:58:16.697 --> 00:58:17.258]  Well, thank you.
[00:58:17.578 --> 00:58:25.419]  For those that don't know, you've got things like emergency and you've got things like airport or whatever it's called that, you know, that people take and those things have some good things in them.
[00:58:25.519 --> 00:58:30.920]  When we did immune wall, I'm like, what's three times stronger than any other immune support formula?
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.581]  They're like, okay, we can make this.
[00:58:33.121 --> 00:58:36.701]  And so anything we make is just chocked full of the very best things.
[00:58:37.081 --> 00:58:40.282]  And yes, the super silver wound gel is a natural
[00:58:40.302 --> 00:58:46.808]  National brand, patented, FDA approved, used at hospitals, used over the counter, $40 a tube.
[00:58:46.968 --> 00:58:49.451]  We have to pay like $13 or something a tube.
[00:58:49.531 --> 00:58:51.372]  For folks who don't know, it's like gloves.
[00:58:51.513 --> 00:58:58.199]  Put a tiny bit on your hands, rub it, and then it's a preemptive wall of the strongest silver allowed by the FDA over the counter.
[00:58:58.419 --> 00:58:59.100]  I'll be very clear.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.002]  Do not ingest it, okay?
[00:59:01.062 --> 00:59:02.444]  It's very toxic.
[00:59:02.564 --> 00:59:03.805]  But, I mean, it's weaponized.
[00:59:03.905 --> 00:59:05.407]  It's the strongest silver over-the-counter.
[00:59:05.507 --> 00:59:09.912]  But bacteria viruses, it's approved and proven to kill them better than a hammer.
[00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:14.638]  Since you mentioned it, my friend, what experience have you had with a super silver wound gel?
[00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:23.501]  Everything from minor burns to actually take out a little sloppy in the kitchen one day and I normally turn my, when I'm chopping stuff, I turn the knife away from me.
[00:59:23.621 --> 00:59:24.181]  I didn't do that.
[00:59:24.201 --> 00:59:28.283]  I was in a hurry and I reached for the knife and I cut my finger right down to the bone.
[00:59:28.523 --> 00:59:35.665]  It was bleeding pretty good and I put the super-silver wound gel on that and wrapped it, of course, and in less than four hours, the pain was gone.
[00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:38.666]  In a day, the deepest part of the cut was already healing up.
[00:59:38.926 --> 00:59:48.472]  It is the best wound gel out there, and I've tried to haggle them down on the price, but after the patents and the FDA approval took them like nine years, this is the thing used in hospitals.
[00:59:48.512 --> 00:59:49.893]  So we're very, very proud of it.
[00:59:49.973 --> 00:59:51.093]  So thanks for the plug, William.
[00:59:57.037 --> 01:00:00.979]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:26.503]  Now I've already covered a ton of news in the first hour.
[01:00:28.264 --> 01:00:31.165]  But I need to drill down into a lot of this.
[01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:39.867]  And I also need to carry out some of the things that I've already been talking about.
[01:00:41.033 --> 01:00:43.975]  And I'll get this posted to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:00:44.095 --> 01:00:45.536]  So I'm going to go work on that right now, actually.
[01:00:46.857 --> 01:00:56.364]  But when we come back in the next segment, I am going to get into the latest on the mass shootings and how they're trying to start a civil war.
[01:00:56.944 --> 01:00:59.787]  And it's starting to get some purchase.
[01:00:59.827 --> 01:01:01.448]  It's starting to get some traction.
[01:01:02.188 --> 01:01:03.409]  And we've got to stop this.
[01:01:03.449 --> 01:01:04.430]  It's extremely serious.
[01:01:05.967 --> 01:01:09.849]  And then we're going to get more into Kashmir and that proxy war that the U.S.
[01:01:09.909 --> 01:01:15.812]  is now in with China, and just how incredible this time and point is in human history.
[01:01:17.093 --> 01:01:29.080]  But I want to air this John Bowne report, FBI Deems Conspiracy Theorist the New Terrorist, because this was all said right before this event took place.
[01:01:30.922 --> 01:01:40.139]  And right after I said they're planning to frame Q movement followers with events, because you can clearly see the cutouts and how this is working.
[01:01:40.179 --> 01:01:43.825]  I'm not saying anybody that's part of the Q thing is a bad person, but here's John Bowne's report.
[01:01:44.747 --> 01:01:54.089]  Recently, an FBI bulletin dated May 30th, 2019 identified conspiracy theory-driven domestic extremists as a terror threat.
[01:01:54.189 --> 01:02:08.113]  The bulletin states, the FBI assesses these conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace, occasionally driving both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts.
[01:02:08.393 --> 01:02:24.441]  However, the Bureau said another factor driving the mounting threat is the uncovering of real conspiracies, or cover-ups, involving illegal, harmful, or unconstitutional activities by government officials or leading political figures.
[01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:28.563]  Ten to twelve men, three teams, three shooters.
[01:02:28.583 --> 01:02:32.965]  The triangulation of five, Clay Shaw and David Barry discussed too much before.
[01:02:33.365 --> 01:02:36.807]  They calibrated their sights, they practiced on moving targets.
[01:02:38.207 --> 01:02:39.407]  They're ready.
[01:02:39.547 --> 01:02:41.068]  It's gonna be a turkey shoot.
[01:02:41.268 --> 01:02:44.708]  Beware those that question the manufactured narrative.
[01:02:45.008 --> 01:02:48.269]  The military-industrial complex is watching you.
[01:02:48.569 --> 01:02:53.550]  Sierra Nevada Corporation, an aerospace and defense company in conjunction with U.S.
[01:02:53.610 --> 01:03:03.412]  military at South Com, is conducting surveillance tests across six Midwestern states using high-altitude balloons, according to documents filed with the FCC.
[01:03:04.332 --> 01:03:15.737]  The Guardian reports, the Pentagon claims the balloons are intended to provide a persistent surveillance system to locate and deter narcotic trafficking and homeland security threats.
[01:03:15.938 --> 01:03:19.379]  The surveillance was authorized to be carried out from July 12, 2019 to 3 a.m.
[01:03:19.399 --> 01:03:20.540]  Eastern Standard Time, September 1, 2019.
[01:03:25.362 --> 01:03:31.047]  And they are currently surveying South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Illinois.
[01:03:31.327 --> 01:03:48.702]  The balloons are connected through a mesh network which allows them to share data, possibly using a video capture system called Gorgon Stare, a surveillance system comprised of nine cameras capable of recording panoramic images across an entire city simultaneously.
[01:03:49.062 --> 01:03:51.484]  Jay Stanley of the ACLU says
[01:03:51.764 --> 01:03:59.693]  We do not think the American city should be subject to wide area surveillance in which every vehicle could be tracked wherever they go.
[01:03:59.934 --> 01:04:09.365]  We should not go down the road of allowing this to be used in the United States, and it's disturbing to hear that these tests are being carried out by the military, no less.
[01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:15.372]  There has been no response from the Pentagon, DARPA, South Com, or the Sierra Nevada Corporation.
[01:04:15.612 --> 01:04:23.821]  None of the parties involved would say whether the Midwest vehicle data would be deleted, stored, or passed on to other federal or local agencies.
[01:04:24.582 --> 01:04:33.510]  Stanley of the ACLU says we would like to know what they are doing with that data, how they are storing it, and whether they are contemplating deploying this in the United States.
[01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:39.255]  Because if they decide that it's usable domestically, there's going to be enormous pressure to deploy it.
[01:04:39.535 --> 01:04:44.840]  Even more disturbing is that Sierra Nevada Corporation isn't the only company doing the tests.
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:58.836]  Worldview recently did a dozen tests for a client they won't name, gathering data they won't reveal, protecting the privacy of the client while preying on the privacy of millions of average American citizens.
[01:04:59.277 --> 01:05:00.478]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:05:05.663 --> 01:05:09.369]  Well today, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:14.899]  I just devoured your cousin, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[01:05:36.423 --> 01:06:00.709]  What in the world's going on here?
[01:06:14.972 --> 01:06:20.053]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:24.014 --> 01:06:32.155]  I am posting on Infowars.com right now congressional testimony by U.S.
[01:06:32.195 --> 01:06:40.376]  intelligence agencies that the United States has been completely penetrated by the Communist Chinese and is basically under their control to a great extent.
[01:06:41.557 --> 01:06:43.417]  Now this was all done by design by the globalists.
[01:06:44.923 --> 01:06:48.844]  And it's a big deal for the government to go ahead and start announcing it to lawmakers to prepare themselves.
[01:06:49.924 --> 01:06:55.245]  Many of the lawmakers who are in the committee are actually Chinese Communist agents, fully compromised.
[01:06:56.185 --> 01:06:57.046]  Dianne Feinstein.
[01:06:57.826 --> 01:06:58.506]  Chuckie Schumer.
[01:07:02.307 --> 01:07:03.227]  Many of the other senators.
[01:07:05.227 --> 01:07:05.608]  Wyden.
[01:07:08.188 --> 01:07:08.568]  Murphy.
[01:07:09.908 --> 01:07:12.109]  They're all on the payroll, literally.
[01:07:12.878 --> 01:07:15.459]  And that's why they're so damn scared, and that's why they want me off the air.
[01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:16.699]  But too late.
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:18.280]  Too late.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.181]  Because if you talked about this, folks, they would come after you like a ton of bricks.
[01:07:23.201 --> 01:07:23.642]  But we did!
[01:07:24.982 --> 01:07:29.684]  And now it's all popularized, and others have the courage to speak, and you are screwed.
[01:07:31.444 --> 01:07:33.145]  So enjoy yourselves, big boys.
[01:07:33.785 --> 01:07:37.206]  Treason is quite a big deal.
[01:07:39.027 --> 01:07:40.087]  So good luck, buckos.
[01:07:41.448 --> 01:07:42.248]  You'll be lucky.
[01:07:45.287 --> 01:07:46.708]  You'll be lucky to go canoeing.
[01:07:46.728 --> 01:07:48.589]  Or maybe kayaking.
[01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:52.171]  While you're in prison.
[01:07:53.332 --> 01:07:56.834]  There's some nice prisons with water sports.
[01:07:58.795 --> 01:07:59.636]  Swimming in the ocean.
[01:08:00.997 --> 01:08:01.797]  Swimming in the creeks.
[01:08:02.117 --> 01:08:03.218]  Swimming in the pools.
[01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.000]  Bubbles and fishies.
[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:09.282]  A lot of beautiful things out there.
[01:08:10.456 --> 01:08:17.979]  Oh, but you're hoping the Chaikoms can defeat America, so you've been giving them the green light to cause a race war in America.
[01:08:17.999 --> 01:08:28.163]  Now seriously, all these Chaikom media operatives, CNN, MSNBC, Hollywood, on the Chaikom payroll, they really are sick freaks.
[01:08:29.363 --> 01:08:32.865]  Lecturing Americans how we're Nazis and how America's bad and how we're evil.
[01:08:34.363 --> 01:08:42.045]  Well, they are on the literal military and corporate and financial mammary gland of the communist Chinese.
[01:08:43.866 --> 01:08:50.988]  That they fence American technology and money and investment through, which is engraved back on top of them.
[01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:58.391]  No wonder they're so scared.
[01:09:00.431 --> 01:09:01.912]  Because they've reached and gone
[01:09:03.294 --> 01:09:04.194]  So incredibly far.
[01:09:04.254 --> 01:09:05.455]  So what is their only hope?
[01:09:07.695 --> 01:09:11.376]  Their only hope is to cause a civil war in this country.
[01:09:11.857 --> 01:09:16.538]  Oh, and that's exactly what's in the report for the U.S.
[01:09:16.578 --> 01:09:19.159]  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:32.863]  Studies and analysis of international threats and how the Communist Chinese have penetrated the entire United States.
[01:09:39.636 --> 01:09:42.139]  They were given the keys to everything.
[01:09:45.203 --> 01:09:45.804]  But not anymore.
[01:09:47.626 --> 01:09:52.572]  And their whole ruse to get us obsessed with the Russians is a distraction.
[01:09:55.116 --> 01:09:58.460]  When Russia, like the US, teeters back and forth under globalist control.
[01:09:59.687 --> 01:10:08.052]  With all the same attack on the family, attack on God, attack on the culture, attack on the borders, attack on the currency, all the same stuff.
[01:10:08.093 --> 01:10:15.237]  Russia has the same enemies that are in bed with China.
[01:10:16.418 --> 01:10:28.206]  So I want to go to your phone calls on the geopolitical insanity of this, the fact that the CFR and Trilateral Commission and their mouthpieces, like the Wall Street Journal and
[01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:39.797]  The New York Times and Atlantic Monthly and the Financial Times of London and the Foreign Affairs are all saying the international order that we've always known is dead and that war is now going to start.
[01:10:41.538 --> 01:10:43.940]  And that's because you're triggering the Chai Kams to start wars.
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.341]  They started it in the South China Sea.
[01:10:46.361 --> 01:10:47.362]  They started it in Hong Kong.
[01:10:47.642 --> 01:10:49.063]  They started it in Vietnam.
[01:10:49.083 --> 01:10:50.484]  They're at war with Vietnam right now.
[01:10:50.865 --> 01:10:55.528]  They've had massive battles going on.
[01:10:57.708 --> 01:10:59.028]  You don't hear about it on our news.
[01:10:59.508 --> 01:11:04.230]  Just like the first two days when India invaded Kashmir, you didn't hear anything about it.
[01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:08.991]  There was no coverage because the system was shocked by it and was like waiting to get the word.
[01:11:10.731 --> 01:11:19.873]  But now you go to CNN, MSNBC, Trump's bad, Modi's bad, the poor Muslims are being ethnically cleansed by the Hindus.
[01:11:21.714 --> 01:11:25.615]  That's like saying the Jews were ethnically cleansing the Germans in World War II.
[01:11:26.355 --> 01:11:27.195]  It's ass backwards.
[01:11:30.233 --> 01:11:32.396]  But meanwhile, at the same time, what's happening?
[01:11:32.976 --> 01:11:36.060]  Four former Fed chiefs issue stark warning.
[01:11:37.161 --> 01:11:37.381]  U.S.
[01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:39.544]  Central Bank must be independent.
[01:11:39.564 --> 01:11:43.309]  Even though the Federal Reserve Act usurped much of our
[01:11:44.775 --> 01:11:47.036]  National sovereignty to private European banks.
[01:11:47.316 --> 01:11:54.259]  They still have the provision that the President could remove people from the Board of Governors of New York and put new people on.
[01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:58.501]  So President Trump is exercising that power, saying China's devaluing the currency.
[01:11:59.162 --> 01:12:01.743]  You've been making major investments with our treasuries in China.
[01:12:02.043 --> 01:12:02.963]  You've been setting policy.
[01:12:04.424 --> 01:12:04.924]  That's over.
[01:12:05.184 --> 01:12:10.647]  And then four former Fed chiefs, because Trump's been removing three members of the board the last year.
[01:12:13.143 --> 01:12:14.685]  Everything you always wanted Ron Paul to do.
[01:12:14.925 --> 01:12:15.966]  Everything we always talked about.
[01:12:16.827 --> 01:12:17.968]  Take over the Federal Reserve.
[01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:19.490]  Abolish it.
[01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:20.571]  Well, it's just easier to take it over.
[01:12:21.853 --> 01:12:22.634]  That's the infrastructure.
[01:12:22.654 --> 01:12:26.057]  We're like Siamese twins with it now, after 104 years.
[01:12:26.077 --> 01:12:26.578]  105 years.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:28.520]  This is 1913.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.723]  Hard to believe it's been that long.
[01:12:32.404 --> 01:12:34.507]  And so crawling out from under their rocks,
[01:12:37.005 --> 01:12:55.219]  The heads of the private bank consortium that hijacked this country in 1913, that have sold out our power for their own personal power to China, come out and say, well, the Federal Reserve shouldn't be for America, and what Trump's doing with it is very dangerous.
[01:12:55.399 --> 01:12:57.341]  Who died and made you God?
[01:12:58.822 --> 01:13:01.004]  So, you want to know if Trump's for real?
[01:13:02.185 --> 01:13:05.047]  This is the biggest proof in the pudding you're ever going to see.
[01:13:06.576 --> 01:13:07.096]  CNN.
[01:13:07.837 --> 01:13:11.139]  Four former Fed chiefs issue stark warning U.S.
[01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:13.061]  Central Bank must be independent.
[01:13:16.043 --> 01:13:19.265]  In an apparent public rebuke of President Donald Trump, Paul Volcker.
[01:13:20.526 --> 01:13:21.967]  That fossil's around under Nixon.
[01:13:23.308 --> 01:13:28.632]  Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen wrote in an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal that the U.S.
[01:13:28.672 --> 01:13:32.115]  Central Bank must be able to make decisions based on best interest of the nation.
[01:13:34.653 --> 01:13:36.735]  Not the interest of a small group of politicians.
[01:13:38.036 --> 01:13:41.899]  Some of the Federal Reserve Act says the President's the only person that has veto over your ass.
[01:13:42.579 --> 01:13:46.463]  After 105 years or whatever it is, he's 106 years.
[01:13:46.543 --> 01:13:47.684]  Are you running us in the ground?
[01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:51.467]  And China?
[01:13:53.909 --> 01:13:56.090]  And unfair trade and devaluing their currency?
[01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:57.792]  And then you're going to tell us that
[01:13:59.414 --> 01:14:02.795]  You never raised interest rates on Obama, but you raised them a bunch under Trump.
[01:14:03.415 --> 01:14:08.977]  And now that Trump says, don't kill our economy, when we're in a trade war, you call, oh, that's not in the interest of the country.
[01:14:09.757 --> 01:14:17.179]  As the Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and all the big banks run around bad-mouthing the dollar and saying it's going down, America's going down.
[01:14:17.399 --> 01:14:20.920]  They're all cheerleading against America and against our president.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.361]  And the politicians they own tell us America was never great.
[01:14:24.841 --> 01:14:25.661]  It'll never be great.
[01:14:26.321 --> 01:14:27.061]  America sucks.
[01:14:27.522 --> 01:14:28.642]  Take down the American flag.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.101]  The Border Patrol are Nazis?
[01:14:32.921 --> 01:14:35.163]  We're killing the children, they're drinking out of toilets!
[01:14:36.563 --> 01:14:39.925]  And magically, two Antifa guys, and it's turned out both of them are Antifa.
[01:14:40.526 --> 01:14:41.466]  They tried to expunge it.
[01:14:42.066 --> 01:14:44.208]  Didn't work in Ohio or in Texas.
[01:14:46.169 --> 01:14:52.652]  Two mentally ill devil worshippers stroll in and do all this, and I tell you, it's the American people's fault.
[01:14:55.414 --> 01:14:56.675]  Why are they always devil worshippers?
[01:14:57.415 --> 01:14:58.756]  Because that's who Democrats are.
[01:15:01.101 --> 01:15:17.888]  But here are these private bankers, all telling us that the economy's going down, we're all dead ducks, right in the middle of Trump removing us from the globalist position that was designing us for economic and cultural collapse and the demoralization.
[01:15:18.128 --> 01:15:22.250]  And there's no doubt Trump's doing it, and there's no doubt that this is amazing.
[01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:26.412]  And there's no doubt what he did with India, and what Modi did is super dangerous, but
[01:15:27.603 --> 01:15:29.824]  India has lost more than half its territory.
[01:15:30.384 --> 01:15:36.086]  The UN tried to take a third of it, but India said we'll go to war unless you leave it autonomous, and then the Chinese rolled in.
[01:15:36.766 --> 01:15:38.207]  So, the Chinese rolled in.
[01:15:38.247 --> 01:15:39.627]  The Indians rolled in to stop that.
[01:15:40.908 --> 01:15:42.448]  And that's where we're at, folks.
[01:15:42.468 --> 01:15:46.750]  This is how World Wars start, and we're in the middle of the beginning of World War IV.
[01:15:48.106 --> 01:15:50.208]  And it's starting right there in Kashmir.
[01:15:50.508 --> 01:15:51.308]  You heard it here first.
[01:15:52.249 --> 01:15:52.810]  Stay with us.
[01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:53.910]  I'm gonna give the number out.
[01:15:53.991 --> 01:16:00.355]  I'm gonna hit the latest on the mass shooting and the Democrats blaming Trump, saying he better not come to Texas.
[01:16:03.218 --> 01:16:03.918]  This is important.
[01:16:05.239 --> 01:16:06.420]  I'm 45 years old.
[01:16:07.541 --> 01:16:10.543]  When I was 35, I swam to two miles a day sometimes.
[01:16:11.184 --> 01:16:12.084]  And would jog.
[01:16:12.785 --> 01:16:13.566]  And couldn't lose weight.
[01:16:14.451 --> 01:16:17.013]  Because I didn't have the missing links.
[01:16:17.193 --> 01:16:21.796]  I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[01:16:22.456 --> 01:16:27.640]  I knew all about the private Federal Reserve, the Trilateral Commission, the New World Order, Jeffrey Epstein, and the pedophile rings.
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:32.883]  I knew all about geopolitical systems, and the old Soviet Union, and how the globals put the shycoms in.
[01:16:33.083 --> 01:16:34.824]  But I didn't know about PQQ.
[01:16:35.505 --> 01:16:36.825]  I didn't know about CoQ10.
[01:16:37.986 --> 01:16:39.347]  I didn't know about all this.
[01:16:40.148 --> 01:16:41.789]  And I didn't know about clean iodine.
[01:16:42.893 --> 01:16:44.454]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation.
[01:16:45.574 --> 01:16:53.819]  I want you to get products that have changed my life, and changed so many other people's lives, that have 98% reviews, and then experience that I'm not BSing you.
[01:16:54.619 --> 01:17:00.702]  So that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated.
[01:17:00.722 --> 01:17:02.243]  Let me tell you something right now.
[01:17:03.543 --> 01:17:04.344]  You see DNA Force?
[01:17:05.464 --> 01:17:18.769]  I went out to top manufacturers that are the most respected, most highly tested, and I said, I want the strongest PQQ CoQ10 overall formula that has pure, non-synthetic stuff in it that's ever been put on the market.
[01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:22.210]  And they said, well, that's like a $22 each bottle.
[01:17:22.710 --> 01:17:23.811]  I said, I want to put $50 a bottle in it.
[01:17:25.441 --> 01:17:27.062]  They said nobody's ever done that.
[01:17:27.122 --> 01:17:29.824]  Then I signed a contract to double the amount I was gonna buy.
[01:17:30.064 --> 01:17:33.326]  I got it down to thirty-something dollars a bottle for what it cost me to make this.
[01:17:34.027 --> 01:17:35.027]  Nobody does that!
[01:17:35.908 --> 01:17:42.192]  Ladies and gentlemen, you read what's in this and you research every ingredient in this and then you experience it for yourself.
[01:17:43.052 --> 01:17:43.753]  It's incredible.
[01:17:45.692 --> 01:17:56.456]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[01:17:57.056 --> 01:17:59.497]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:18:09.326 --> 01:18:11.467]  We're going to talk to Jason in Florida.
[01:18:12.147 --> 01:18:13.368]  Jason, thanks for calling in.
[01:18:13.648 --> 01:18:15.049]  What's your view on the situation?
[01:18:15.269 --> 01:18:16.269]  How should Trump take action?
[01:18:16.289 --> 01:18:16.489]  Mr. Jones.
[01:18:16.949 --> 01:18:17.230]  Go ahead.
[01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:18.970]  First of all, I'd like to plug products.
[01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:21.772]  My son and I are both big Super Blue fans.
[01:18:21.832 --> 01:18:26.033]  My son also takes the Honor Roll, which is a fantastic product.
[01:18:26.094 --> 01:18:28.775]  Originally, they wanted to test him for ADHD.
[01:18:28.855 --> 01:18:30.375]  Well, that wasn't the case at all.
[01:18:30.395 --> 01:18:31.976]  He's just a really smart kid.
[01:18:32.076 --> 01:18:36.338]  So the Honor Roll product, amazing, amazing results from that product.
[01:18:36.398 --> 01:18:38.399]  Mr. Jones, thank you very much for everything.
[01:18:38.459 --> 01:18:41.902]  Since you raise it, it's doing our research with top companies.
[01:18:42.002 --> 01:18:52.933]  It's one of the highest rated blends of fish oil, particularly with small caplets for children, and it's had the mercury taken out of it, and they found that it's really a missing link in a lot of young people's brains.
[01:18:53.373 --> 01:18:54.254]  What effect did it have?
[01:18:54.494 --> 01:18:56.495]  I actually allowed him to focus.
[01:18:56.555 --> 01:19:00.497]  As a five-year-old kid, he was having a little trouble staying in his seat and things like that.
[01:19:00.657 --> 01:19:02.338]  And, you know, I feed him well.
[01:19:02.398 --> 01:19:03.319]  He exercises.
[01:19:03.359 --> 01:19:05.120]  We swim every day and things like that.
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:12.104]  But the reality is, I just think his diet was missing something that over the last year of using the Honor Lowell product off the charts.
[01:19:12.184 --> 01:19:16.947]  He's testing in the top percentages of his class, and it's just people are beside themselves.
[01:19:17.047 --> 01:19:18.908]  And, you know, I swear by the product.
[01:19:19.128 --> 01:19:19.488]  I wouldn't
[01:19:19.548 --> 01:19:19.768]  I think.
[01:19:19.808 --> 01:19:20.088]  I think.
[01:19:20.108 --> 01:19:20.349]  I think.
[01:19:20.369 --> 01:19:20.649]  I think.
[01:19:38.444 --> 01:19:39.805]  Jason, thank you for your support.
[01:19:40.006 --> 01:19:42.188]  Good, clean fish oil or krill oil.
[01:19:42.508 --> 01:19:43.189]  There's nothing better.
[01:19:43.249 --> 01:19:49.875]  I mean, with my own children, one of my daughters, she can kind of get up, low blood sugar, be a little bit grumpy, get her to eat some basic food, then she's not grumpy.
[01:19:49.895 --> 01:19:53.178]  But when she takes her fish oil, she goes, Daddy, I feel so much better after I take it.
[01:19:53.198 --> 01:19:54.019]  I'm like, absolutely.
[01:19:54.059 --> 01:19:54.720]  So thank you, Jason.
[01:20:06.323 --> 01:20:10.368]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:25.164 --> 01:20:26.025]  We found it!
[01:20:26.798 --> 01:20:28.460]  Public Enemy Numero Uno!
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:34.345]  Whether you happen to be a communist or a mega-billionaire or an anti-American scumbag, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:35.286 --> 01:20:41.673]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com are the verboten, forbidden websites you're not supposed to visit and you're not supposed to share.
[01:20:42.619 --> 01:20:45.060]  You're not supposed to listen to David Knight, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:47.201]  Infowars.com, Ford's Class Show.
[01:20:47.761 --> 01:20:51.723]  You're not supposed to listen to Owen Schroyer, weekday afternoons, 3 p.m.
[01:20:51.743 --> 01:20:53.364]  Central, after the broadcast, either.
[01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:55.205]  You're not supposed to share it, definitely.
[01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:56.845]  You're supposed to sit down and shut up.
[01:20:56.886 --> 01:20:57.846]  Mark Zuckerberg said so.
[01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:05.389]  Just a few months ago, he said, don't share Alex Jones's name, his photo, or his websites in any positive vein, or you'll be banned.
[01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:08.591]  And since then, thousands of people have posted where they're told just that.
[01:21:09.864 --> 01:21:12.586]  And any Infowars.com or Alex Jones photo is blurred out.
[01:21:12.606 --> 01:21:16.009]  The old Soviet Union used to do that too in newspapers.
[01:21:16.029 --> 01:21:18.591]  They'd go back and airbrush out people that had been disappeared.
[01:21:19.491 --> 01:21:22.914]  Very, very dangerous and Congress needs to act.
[01:21:22.934 --> 01:21:25.016]  But first we've got to cut off the funding.
[01:21:25.316 --> 01:21:26.317]  The Chai Coms, they're doing it.
[01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:30.460]  Now, the fact that we've gotten to the point that this is coming out is incredible.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:41.284]  And just praise God and thank you Jesus and pass the ammunition because, figuratively in the info war, because this is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:21:42.424 --> 01:21:48.247]  And you see the squealing and the squawking and the freaking out and the chicken with the head cut off behavior.
[01:21:48.867 --> 01:21:53.069]  And that's because these criminal networks are having their money cut off right now.
[01:21:53.869 --> 01:21:57.931]  And for everything you see Trump doing, there is a lot going on behind the scenes.
[01:21:58.051 --> 01:22:00.812]  And Trump defeated the witch hunt.
[01:22:02.145 --> 01:22:05.747]  He was bought for over two years, and now we're really starting to move in the right direction.
[01:22:06.327 --> 01:22:15.932]  He's doing some frightening things on guns with rhetoric, which is meant to take the wind out of their sails and kill their arguments, and then encourage them to say, ban all the guns.
[01:22:16.292 --> 01:22:18.353]  Like Joe Biden said last night, we'll play that coming up.
[01:22:19.714 --> 01:22:20.414]  It's still dangerous.
[01:22:21.194 --> 01:22:26.777]  Very dangerous game to intellectually cede anything to these people when it's all fraud, but still.
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:30.441]  It's an amazing time.
[01:22:30.961 --> 01:22:35.345]  I want to get your take on, do you agree with me about this historical time that World War IV has begun?
[01:22:35.365 --> 01:22:37.366]  It's an economic culture war.
[01:22:38.367 --> 01:22:41.269]  Do you think we're going to win this thing?
[01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:42.370]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:43.311]  What are you doing?
[01:22:43.751 --> 01:22:45.012]  What do you make of the mass shootings?
[01:22:45.052 --> 01:22:50.277]  What do you make of the private fellow reserve not doing what Trump wanted?
[01:22:50.337 --> 01:22:53.599]  So he started removing members of the board a few months ago.
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:56.802]  He's removed three, nominated new people.
[01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:03.754]  And now the private Federal Reserve comes out, the former directors, and say, you're not a good American.
[01:23:03.774 --> 01:23:07.635]  You need to stop exercising authority when it's in the Federal Reserve Act.
[01:23:08.095 --> 01:23:08.995]  But no president.
[01:23:10.375 --> 01:23:11.015]  No president.
[01:23:12.856 --> 01:23:16.456]  No president except Nixon kind of made some noises and they removed him quickly.
[01:23:17.037 --> 01:23:18.877]  Nobody's gone up against the big banks.
[01:23:19.497 --> 01:23:19.937]  Nobody.
[01:23:22.078 --> 01:23:23.898]  But see, Trump has an ace in the hole.
[01:23:26.837 --> 01:23:32.920]  The Pentagon, the thinkers, the people and the public, they know China was given the upper hand and we were sold out to them.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:36.541]  So there's an ace of spades that this is treason.
[01:23:37.121 --> 01:23:39.542]  There's an ace of spades that we're going to kill our prosperity.
[01:23:40.503 --> 01:23:45.885]  It was one thing to be selling out to the Chinese for 30 years when we were all getting a bunch of money and the country was still doing okay.
[01:23:47.126 --> 01:23:54.549]  But now that we're the fattened Christmas hog getting walked in to have our throats slit, a lot of folks that kind of turned a blind eye are going,
[01:23:55.404 --> 01:23:57.025]  Why should we give up all our power?
[01:23:58.145 --> 01:23:59.646]  See, it's a separation of power issue.
[01:23:59.666 --> 01:24:00.447]  The founders knew this.
[01:24:01.587 --> 01:24:09.992]  They knew bad, corrupt men would get in government at some point, but if they all had three branches of government fighting with each other for power, no branch would ever get an upper hand.
[01:24:11.773 --> 01:24:12.353]  Smart guys.
[01:24:12.893 --> 01:24:14.134]  Thomas Jefferson, pretty smart.
[01:24:14.694 --> 01:24:15.875]  Probably one of the smartest ever lived.
[01:24:17.316 --> 01:24:23.379]  And also head of the Illuminati, but then he got out of it.
[01:24:26.274 --> 01:24:27.775]  That's in George Washington's letters, too.
[01:24:28.336 --> 01:24:32.999]  You know what's so amazing about history is that it's all right there for everybody to see.
[01:24:33.019 --> 01:24:35.121]  It's actually all right there.
[01:24:36.722 --> 01:24:44.928]  And so I want to take some of your phone calls, and I said yesterday I'd take like ten, but a bunch more came in and then I didn't get to four callers, so ten only till I get to you.
[01:24:45.188 --> 01:24:45.809]  I got to the ten.
[01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:50.405]  I didn't get to the others, and I apologize.
[01:24:50.425 --> 01:24:50.785]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:24:51.605 --> 01:24:56.208]  First-time callers, long-time callers, whatever.
[01:24:56.228 --> 01:24:56.548]  877-789-2539.
[01:24:57.969 --> 01:25:01.491]  Specifically on this incredible historical time that we're alive in.
[01:25:03.472 --> 01:25:06.593]  Remember we said, Walmart's building makeshift.
[01:25:07.254 --> 01:25:11.736]  Prisons that looked like they had prisons next to family areas that aren't prisons.
[01:25:12.136 --> 01:25:13.237]  And now it's all in the news.
[01:25:13.577 --> 01:25:15.058]  There was a secret program under Obama.
[01:25:15.865 --> 01:25:20.128]  To prepare for mass immigration that Obama was preparing with the UN, and we were right about it all.
[01:25:21.388 --> 01:25:22.269]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:31.034]  Trump to visit El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, testing his ability to heal, says the Wall Street Journal, his supposed friend.
[01:25:32.976 --> 01:25:35.417]  Same Wall Street Journal, you know, telling us Trump's doing a bad job.
[01:25:36.758 --> 01:25:39.700]  And oh, you've got Democrats saying, you better not come here, Trump.
[01:25:42.028 --> 01:25:43.229]  Better not come here, Trump.
[01:25:43.929 --> 01:25:44.149]  Why?
[01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:45.130]  You're the reason this happened.
[01:25:45.650 --> 01:25:48.332]  They want to lie about Trump, put words in his mouth?
[01:25:48.392 --> 01:25:50.953]  No, he should go, just like he's gone to other events.
[01:25:51.633 --> 01:25:52.094]  It's healing.
[01:25:52.114 --> 01:25:54.535]  A lot of the families are saying, we absolutely want him here.
[01:25:54.835 --> 01:25:56.556]  How dare the media say we don't want him here?
[01:25:57.156 --> 01:25:59.278]  They're just trying to put salt in the wounds.
[01:25:59.718 --> 01:26:08.443]  But here's a clip of Trump critic, Representative Veronica Escobar, saying, do not come to El Paso.
[01:26:10.103 --> 01:26:12.704]  I live in an extraordinary community.
[01:26:13.385 --> 01:26:16.306]  People have come together like never before.
[01:26:16.827 --> 01:26:19.408]  People are wrapping their arms around one another.
[01:26:19.448 --> 01:26:21.569]  We had two beautiful vigils last night.
[01:26:22.049 --> 01:26:25.631]  We are the epitome of goodness as a community.
[01:26:25.731 --> 01:26:27.212]  We welcome the stranger.
[01:26:27.652 --> 01:26:29.273]  We take care of the vulnerable.
[01:26:30.333 --> 01:26:32.415]  And that is who El Paso is.
[01:26:32.455 --> 01:26:35.896]  And I'm so proud to be a member of this community.
[01:26:36.797 --> 01:26:38.658]  Words have consequences.
[01:26:39.438 --> 01:26:45.621]  And the President has made my community and my people the enemy.
[01:26:46.402 --> 01:26:52.725]  He has told the country that we are people to be feared, people to be hated.
[01:26:53.245 --> 01:26:54.906]  He has done that at his rallies.
[01:26:55.326 --> 01:26:57.047]  He has done that through his Twitter.
[01:26:57.648 --> 01:27:01.370]  I heard earlier someone mention that he may be coming here.
[01:27:02.370 --> 01:27:18.599]  I hope that he has the self-awareness to understand that we are in pain and we are mourning and we are doing our very best in our typical, beautiful, graceful El Paso way to continue to be resilient.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:28.488]  And so I would ask his staff and his team to consider the fact that his words and his actions have played a role in this.
[01:27:28.508 --> 01:27:32.271]  Alright, enough of Veronica Escobar going on to say don't come here.
[01:27:32.291 --> 01:27:34.353]  Mexico, again, 200,000 dead in the last 10 years.
[01:27:37.406 --> 01:27:38.707]  Millions unaccounted for.
[01:27:39.567 --> 01:27:41.048]  Massive collapse and corruption.
[01:27:41.108 --> 01:27:45.191]  Coyotes raping 80% of the women and young children that come across.
[01:27:45.331 --> 01:27:46.112]  Sex slavery.
[01:27:46.432 --> 01:27:47.132]  Senate reports.
[01:27:48.133 --> 01:27:49.894]  Obama builds the emergency centers.
[01:27:50.414 --> 01:27:52.055]  Democrats run and get the money off of them.
[01:27:52.075 --> 01:27:53.656]  That's even been in mainstream news.
[01:27:54.597 --> 01:27:55.718]  The people pour across.
[01:27:57.039 --> 01:27:58.860]  We catch and release 90% of them.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.861]  The others, our criminal records are sent back.
[01:28:01.341 --> 01:28:02.322]  Our border's wide open.
[01:28:03.082 --> 01:28:06.665]  And then Trump simply tries to secure it and say it's okay to have a border.
[01:28:07.639 --> 01:28:10.761]  And she says being a nationalist at all is racist.
[01:28:10.781 --> 01:28:13.503]  I mean, that's what they're saying about Italy's president.
[01:28:14.743 --> 01:28:18.746]  Saying that having a country itself, believing in your nation, is supremist.
[01:28:19.126 --> 01:28:21.127]  Like the Indians don't want to lose part of their country.
[01:28:21.507 --> 01:28:22.408]  The UN tried to take.
[01:28:23.128 --> 01:28:24.789]  So they're taking it back because China moved in.
[01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.411]  China moved in with paramilitary.
[01:28:28.311 --> 01:28:28.952]  With Pakistan.
[01:28:29.432 --> 01:28:31.313]  They've been attacking, killing Indians every day.
[01:28:31.333 --> 01:28:33.715]  So they roll in and say it's our country.
[01:28:33.755 --> 01:28:33.935]  No.
[01:28:34.395 --> 01:28:37.057]  Oh, you're a Hindu supremist.
[01:28:38.604 --> 01:28:44.890]  Meanwhile, the Hindu guys look just like the Muslims, because the Muslims used to be Hindus or Buddhists.
[01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:48.333]  They just got converted to Islam, because Islam's taken over half of India.
[01:28:48.513 --> 01:28:49.394]  And that's not enough!
[01:28:50.035 --> 01:28:53.618]  The Muslims are bombing all over India, and India's supposed to sit there and take it.
[01:28:53.678 --> 01:28:56.060]  It's like America's supposed to take a collapsing border.
[01:28:56.541 --> 01:28:57.682]  No, Trump's our president.
[01:28:57.902 --> 01:28:58.823]  He's going to the border.
[01:28:58.883 --> 01:28:59.183]  Which?
[01:28:59.483 --> 01:29:00.384]  And that's the way it is.
[01:29:00.424 --> 01:29:01.145]  Your call's coming up.
[01:29:03.138 --> 01:29:18.040]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com, and there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force+.
[01:29:18.641 --> 01:29:22.204]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests.
[01:29:22.564 --> 01:29:26.027]  Telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:34.833]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[01:29:34.853 --> 01:29:36.975]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but
[01:29:37.495 --> 01:29:38.175]  It's expensive.
[01:29:38.255 --> 01:29:38.515]  Why?
[01:29:38.575 --> 01:29:41.076]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[01:29:41.356 --> 01:29:48.298]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support, and they came and they went.
[01:29:48.639 --> 01:29:51.339]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[01:29:51.699 --> 01:29:52.940]  It is the elite supplement.
[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:57.001]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[01:29:57.041 --> 01:30:02.883]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:30:03.163 --> 01:30:11.930]  Let me get into something briefly that is so paramount that it deals with the very essence of the soul and the spark of consciousness and creation.
[01:30:12.190 --> 01:30:15.993]  Every study documents what we already know in our heart and minds to be true.
[01:30:16.133 --> 01:30:19.236]  That apathy leads to entropy, leads to collapse.
[01:30:19.456 --> 01:30:24.200]  And that if you don't have a purpose-driven life, you will die before your body fails.
[01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:31.305]  Apathy, most common symptom of dementia, science daily, distinct from depression, present in nearly half of patients.
[01:30:31.485 --> 01:30:33.046]  This is out of the University of Exeter.
[01:30:33.226 --> 01:30:43.213]  Apathy is the most common neuropsychiatric symptom of dementia, with a bigger impact on the functioning than memory loss, yet is under-researched and often forgotten.
[01:30:43.373 --> 01:30:49.137]  And our very way of life is now sitting in front of screens, clicking on things to get dopamine rushes.
[01:30:49.397 --> 01:30:54.100]  And so when you go out in the real world, you don't get a dopamine rush off an owl flying over.
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:59.063]  Hawk, or the moon, or airplanes flying in the sky like we're in a science fiction movie.
[01:30:59.123 --> 01:31:00.765]  We are science fiction reality.
[01:31:00.845 --> 01:31:09.991]  And just the magic of the universe and these experiences of falling off your bike, or jumping a dirt hill, or getting in a fist fight, or kissing that girl for the first time.
[01:31:10.111 --> 01:31:19.878]  These are deep experiences that our ancestors experienced that are rituals within us that open up the gateways to perception in the universe.
[01:31:20.018 --> 01:31:21.620]  We must go through the rituals.
[01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:23.541]  That's why the enemy tries to domesticate people
[01:31:23.541 --> 01:31:28.884]  Well, nobody knows how to do math anymore because we use calculators, and soon we won't know how to drive cars anymore because they're all going to be self-driving.
[01:31:29.104 --> 01:31:42.733]  This system is designed to dehumanize us, and the people that run it admit they're doing it to dehumanize us, because they want us out of the way so the globalists can control the future, and so they can dictate the new architecture.
[01:31:42.853 --> 01:31:50.878]  And so instead of just physically killing us right away, they kill our intellect, they kill our spark, they kill that which makes us higher than the animals.
[01:31:51.118 --> 01:31:57.943]  That we can control our own environments, and that we can control our own destinies to a certain extent, and that we can envision things, and then build those things.
[01:31:58.163 --> 01:31:59.204]  That we're master builders.
[01:31:59.404 --> 01:32:10.051]  But when you dial into the universe, and the mystic secrets, and all the magic, and the real potential, and the ancestral memories, and the ancestral will, that is, again, electromagnetic,
[01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:23.600]  Electrochemical from you to your most ancient ancestor is an unbroken electromagnetic chain of genetic information that operates as an antenna to receive and transmit as a transceiver into higher dimensions.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:25.161]  This has all been proven scientifically.
[01:32:25.301 --> 01:32:33.987]  The enemy can't stand it when I get on air because I already know all their equations, their operations, and then of course later I can go out and research and they've written and said exactly this, but in their more secretive reports.
[01:32:34.247 --> 01:32:38.070]  Let me just tell you, I'm giving you the big enchilada, okay?
[01:32:38.710 --> 01:32:39.411]  Oh, we're real.
[01:32:39.731 --> 01:32:40.511]  Oh, we're eternal.
[01:32:41.472 --> 01:32:44.133]  And they don't want you to know that because you're awesome.
[01:32:44.314 --> 01:32:51.198]  And they want to lead you with them into their creation that is a leaking, stinking hellhole.
[01:32:51.458 --> 01:32:54.320]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[01:32:54.460 --> 01:33:00.564]  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:33:00.844 --> 01:33:02.465]  It's all in plain view, people.
[01:33:05.737 --> 01:33:08.330]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:34.426]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:33:35.407 --> 01:33:39.310]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:43.573]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:33:43.934 --> 01:33:45.615]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:46.916 --> 01:33:53.001]  Now we've reached the halfway point in the global broadcast, and I've only scratched the surface.
[01:33:53.721 --> 01:33:54.982]  We're going to get to as much as we can.
[01:33:56.164 --> 01:34:14.595]  We have the war room with Owen Schroeder today that's going to have coverage of Air Force One stepping, landing, setting down, and then Trump going to the site of what happened and comforting those who lost loved ones and those that are injured in El Paso.
[01:34:15.555 --> 01:34:18.757]  And the Democrats are telling him that when he sets down, you know, he shouldn't do that.
[01:34:18.797 --> 01:34:22.980]  He shouldn't dare do that because they're just going to call him a Nazi and make up more lies about it.
[01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:27.211]  But Trump's not going to go along with that and let them put words in his mouth.
[01:34:27.251 --> 01:34:34.513]  Now, I've got a whole crew in there trying to get Dayton, Ohio coverage, and the media's not covering Trump in Dayton.
[01:34:34.773 --> 01:34:36.154]  They're just covering the protesters.
[01:34:37.074 --> 01:34:41.435]  And they're covering the protesters, I've got satellite feeds, of people in El Paso.
[01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:45.717]  That's how controlled all of this is.
[01:34:46.277 --> 01:34:48.338]  Don't let you hear what the President actually said.
[01:34:49.298 --> 01:34:50.718]  Just put words in his mouth.
[01:34:50.798 --> 01:34:52.339]  That's what happens when they deplatform you.
[01:34:53.131 --> 01:34:55.793]  And more and more, they're not covering his speeches, they're not covering his quotes.
[01:34:56.354 --> 01:35:01.958]  The corporate media is so scared, they are absolutely blocking what the President said in Dayton.
[01:35:01.978 --> 01:35:06.902]  But we're getting that video for you, and we're going to have it for you.
[01:35:07.623 --> 01:35:12.707]  But when he is there, they're going to do their best to not let you see him bring people together.
[01:35:13.848 --> 01:35:22.735]  All they do is give the little inflatable Trump baby balloon coverage, no matter where he goes in the world.
[01:35:23.689 --> 01:35:31.235]  And we are showing you again satellite footage of some of what's going on and also what happened earlier in Dayton.
[01:35:32.355 --> 01:35:42.663]  We have to go through a lot of trouble to blur these events out because there's so many cuss words by the Democrats on the signs and being said, you know, I never got to the Cheshire State.
[01:35:42.683 --> 01:35:47.006]  I was so busy covering Kashmir and the fact that this global crisis has intensified.
[01:35:47.967 --> 01:35:48.828]  We didn't get to the
[01:35:49.912 --> 01:35:56.115]  Mitch McConnell's house in Kentucky with a bunch of people coming to his house saying, we're going to stab you in the heart, we're going to kill you.
[01:35:56.836 --> 01:35:59.977]  DrugsReport.com, link to our article, when we first broke it.
[01:36:00.077 --> 01:36:02.599]  And of course, Tucker Carlson covered it last night.
[01:36:02.619 --> 01:36:04.040]  He's had them come to his house as well.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.343]  But what was crazy about the videos that we have time later on play, we have a guest joining us.
[01:36:11.744 --> 01:36:22.929]  Is that they have small children with them, and the small children have signs saying F. McConnell, the murderer turtle, as they're calling him.
[01:36:23.289 --> 01:36:26.230]  They're in front of his house saying, we're going to stab you in the heart.
[01:36:28.712 --> 01:36:34.274]  We're going to stab you in the heart.
[01:36:36.656 --> 01:36:38.177]  And you just look at these scum.
[01:36:38.197 --> 01:36:49.540]  They're so full of themselves using what happened at these shootings to then project it on anybody else out of 340 million Americans and say that people deserve to die.
[01:36:51.321 --> 01:36:55.762]  Dayton shooter Connor Betts is America's first Antifa killer.
[01:36:57.363 --> 01:37:04.065]  Mainstream media AP reports Dayton mass shooter attended Antifa rally armed with guns similar to one used in massacre.
[01:37:05.572 --> 01:37:15.456]  Turned out he loved Satan and couldn't wait to be in hell with Satan, and was in a new popular liberal movement where you sing about raping and killing women.
[01:37:15.516 --> 01:37:17.697]  It's the super hot thing with the left.
[01:37:18.197 --> 01:37:22.379]  Women are involved in it as well, because degrading themselves is the best thing.
[01:37:22.799 --> 01:37:24.220]  Celebrate killing babies as well.
[01:37:25.421 --> 01:37:30.863]  Dayton mass shooter attended an anti-war rally armed with guns, similar to the one used in Massacre, was in a music band
[01:37:32.264 --> 01:37:35.187]  That celebrated defiling Christ and women.
[01:37:35.867 --> 01:37:36.808]  And raping women.
[01:37:38.630 --> 01:37:40.071]  Bernie Sanders campaign.
[01:37:40.131 --> 01:37:41.393]  Don't blame us for Dayton.
[01:37:41.413 --> 01:37:42.634]  Blame Trump for El Paso.
[01:37:42.654 --> 01:37:48.680]  Even though the psychotic devil worshipper from Dayton was a huge Bernie-tender-to-putter.
[01:37:50.241 --> 01:37:50.922]  Squad leader.
[01:37:51.843 --> 01:37:52.483]  AOC.
[01:37:53.004 --> 01:37:56.667]  Trump is directly responsible for the mass shootings in El Paso.
[01:37:56.687 --> 01:37:57.108]  That's right.
[01:37:59.793 --> 01:38:06.555]  Continuing, 2019 data shows 51% of mass shooters were black, only 29% were white.
[01:38:07.055 --> 01:38:09.976]  Paul Joseph Watson article, Infowars.com.
[01:38:10.016 --> 01:38:11.536]  That's not laying blame on black people.
[01:38:11.556 --> 01:38:22.979]  It's still a very small percentage of black people that commit crime, but half of the mass shootings in this country is black on black.
[01:38:23.479 --> 01:38:24.640]  You know who kills black people?
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:25.420]  Black people.
[01:38:28.063 --> 01:38:29.604]  Number one killer of white people is white people.
[01:38:29.624 --> 01:38:30.985]  We killed people we know.
[01:38:31.125 --> 01:38:32.046]  People we're pissed off at.
[01:38:32.066 --> 01:38:35.389]  That's who's killing who.
[01:38:37.630 --> 01:38:38.431]  There's another big article.
[01:38:38.471 --> 01:38:40.713]  The National Review does an occasional good job.
[01:38:40.753 --> 01:38:41.954]  Mass murder without guns.
[01:38:42.034 --> 01:38:47.438]  The fact that cars, planes, trucks, knives, baseball bats are way more common than guns.
[01:38:47.818 --> 01:38:55.124]  And that in areas like China and areas in Europe, there are more people killed with knives and hatchets and things than there are with guns and mass deaths.
[01:38:56.795 --> 01:38:58.916]  Yeah, some of these truck attacks kill over 100 people.
[01:38:59.376 --> 01:39:01.017]  Do we go, we need to ban trucks!
[01:39:04.819 --> 01:39:06.859]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:06.979 --> 01:39:07.500]  Ahead of...
[01:39:08.621 --> 01:39:10.082]  A very interesting fellow joining us.
[01:39:11.062 --> 01:39:15.404]  My wife's a fan of his work and listens to it, and so I've listened to it on some road trips and things.
[01:39:16.144 --> 01:39:21.726]  And I noticed when I was Googling him, he's a listener of the show and has, you know, the Answer 1984, 7076 shirts and stuff.
[01:39:22.226 --> 01:39:24.287]  So he's got WhatOnEarthIsHappening.com.
[01:39:24.327 --> 01:39:25.948]  Mark Passio has been rescheduled twice.
[01:39:25.968 --> 01:39:27.408]  It's all the big crises going on.
[01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:28.249]  He's a really smart guy.
[01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:30.950]  Hope he'll be a regular guest getting into natural law.
[01:39:31.570 --> 01:39:33.991]  Kind of his view on fake Christians, how the cult works.
[01:39:34.291 --> 01:39:35.891]  He says a lot of stuff that I think is really smart.
[01:39:36.291 --> 01:39:39.312]  We're going to get him to be able to show this next hour as well.
[01:39:39.732 --> 01:39:40.913]  So that's all coming up.
[01:39:42.033 --> 01:39:43.794]  Let's go to your phone calls now.
[01:39:44.514 --> 01:39:51.476]  We got Kenneth, John, Pastor Sam, Tracy, Carlos, Bill, Chase the Patriot, Rick, Brad, and Kevin.
[01:39:52.239 --> 01:39:53.640]  So I don't say first-time callers.
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.121]  These guys get in, but they're all great callers.
[01:39:55.161 --> 01:39:55.622]  That's okay.
[01:39:56.062 --> 01:39:58.584]  Pastor Sam's been calling in for 20 years or something.
[01:39:58.884 --> 01:39:59.965]  He's in El Paso.
[01:40:00.446 --> 01:40:02.407]  He says he's at the anti-Trump protest.
[01:40:02.687 --> 01:40:03.908]  What are you seeing, Pastor Sam?
[01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:08.092]  All kinds of fat liberal chicks.
[01:40:08.352 --> 01:40:16.278]  It's hard to tell for sure that they're chicks, but we are talking about thousands of milkshakes went into the making of some of these protesters.
[01:40:16.718 --> 01:40:18.480]  I came up from Mexico for this.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:24.382]  I'm really happy that Trump has pushed a pawn in Guatemala.
[01:40:24.683 --> 01:40:30.386]  And then, I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop, and chaos breaks out all over the world.
[01:40:30.806 --> 01:40:31.667]  You're right, Alex.
[01:40:31.787 --> 01:40:33.388]  The Chinese are furious.
[01:40:33.968 --> 01:40:35.829]  They're causing military attack.
[01:40:36.809 --> 01:40:38.110]  That's right.
[01:40:38.130 --> 01:40:39.791]  You're a pastor, a missionary.
[01:40:39.811 --> 01:40:41.272]  You've been calling for many years in Mexico.
[01:40:41.552 --> 01:40:45.915]  You've called in about the Chinese communist presence and how they're trying to foment Mexico.
[01:40:46.015 --> 01:40:46.535]  All this stuff.
[01:40:47.990 --> 01:41:07.561]  Yes, and about the communist president in Mexico, and the fall of country after country, getting communist presidents in, like the newest one in Panama got elected with 33% of the vote, so he's the one in charge now, Nino Cortizo, and that's another country that's very unlikely that we can count on.
[01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:14.965]  So Trump finally came in and signed this agreement with Guatemala, and this is, deportation is the law.
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:22.969]  Anybody from Africa, anybody from South America that goes through Guatemala and then sets foot in the USA goes directly to Guatemala.
[01:41:23.269 --> 01:41:29.656]  And that's why AOC is in Guatemala right now with Nancy Pelosi for a huge event tomorrow.
[01:41:29.937 --> 01:41:30.237]  That's right.
[01:41:30.257 --> 01:41:33.000]  They're in another country trying to break our border.
[01:41:33.301 --> 01:41:34.202]  You talk about treason.
[01:41:35.236 --> 01:41:47.785]  The whole Mod Squad is down there, the Broad Squad or whatever they call themselves, plus Nancy Pelosi, plus Norma J. Torres, the Guatemalan-born California Congresswoman that I have broadcasted about before on your show.
[01:41:48.225 --> 01:41:57.572]  She was in an interview at least six months ago, it's up on my YouTube channel in Spanish, where in the interview it's clearly admitted that many of the migrants are from Venezuela.
[01:41:57.792 --> 01:41:59.513]  And that's back when they were denying it.
[01:42:00.262 --> 01:42:01.723]  So, they're all down there.
[01:42:02.023 --> 01:42:04.425]  They're trying to stop what Trump has done.
[01:42:04.565 --> 01:42:06.667]  But the fact is, it is law now.
[01:42:06.687 --> 01:42:07.507]  That's right.
[01:42:07.547 --> 01:42:08.108]  Let's be clear.
[01:42:08.168 --> 01:42:10.109]  Guatemala got paid off by the U.N.
[01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:19.256]  and Soros to set up giant refugee camps to stage people to then flood and then go to the Democrat facilities built by Obama that Democrats literally own.
[01:42:19.356 --> 01:42:23.439]  Rich donors own these camps that were putting the old Walmarts they kept secret.
[01:42:24.059 --> 01:42:34.161]  And then Trump's just trying to fix the problem, and they're calling him a Nazi, saying people drink out of toilets, and AOC's donors literally, it's been in the news, own the facilities, brother!
[01:42:35.965 --> 01:42:37.586]  Seriously, it's unreal.
[01:42:37.766 --> 01:42:40.827]  If somebody does not believe it, just look at the newspaper.
[01:42:40.847 --> 01:42:41.688]  It's in Breitbart.
[01:42:42.048 --> 01:42:43.889]  She is in Guatemala.
[01:42:44.129 --> 01:42:44.389]  I know.
[01:42:44.449 --> 01:42:44.949]  I saw that.
[01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:49.011]  Listen, Pastor Sam, I've never done it, but we're going to launch that podcast with callers.
[01:42:49.251 --> 01:42:50.151]  Get his name and number.
[01:42:50.372 --> 01:42:51.432]  He'll be one of the guys that does it.
[01:42:51.752 --> 01:42:53.433]  We're going to do it soon, but I've been a little busy.
[01:42:53.753 --> 01:42:55.194]  Believe me, I'm trying to get it done here.
[01:42:55.554 --> 01:42:58.275]  I'm busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.
[01:42:59.356 --> 01:42:59.796]  Stay with us.
[01:43:03.374 --> 01:43:14.241]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.

[01:43:17.704 --> 01:43:20.686]  No one can doubt that InfoWars has changed the world.
[01:43:21.226 --> 01:43:32.634]  The globalists give us credit for discrediting their world government system, their neoliberal fascist plan, and infecting, in their words, the entire world
[01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:34.515]  With nationalism.
[01:43:34.795 --> 01:43:36.297]  Now, how did I do that?
[01:43:37.458 --> 01:43:38.559]  I did that because of you.
[01:43:39.159 --> 01:43:39.700]  We did that.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:40.741]  You did that.
[01:43:40.761 --> 01:43:44.184]  We're either going to have freedom or we're going to have slavery.
[01:43:44.204 --> 01:43:47.627]  And these corporatists play nation states off against each other.
[01:43:48.188 --> 01:43:49.629]  They play men and women off against each other.
[01:43:49.649 --> 01:43:52.211]  They play people off against each other for what color their skin is.
[01:43:53.292 --> 01:43:56.475]  But the people of the world more and more are seeing through it.
[01:43:57.536 --> 01:43:59.398]  And that's why I want all of you right now
[01:44:00.583 --> 01:44:15.676]  As the world government falls apart, as the New World Order hits the panic button and tries to start a race war, to realize that we have come so far, and that all these globalists have now is trying to stir up internal information warfare fights.
[01:44:16.677 --> 01:44:25.364]  But we knew history, and knew that these globalists are arrogant, and there would come a time when their system would enter a crisis.
[01:44:26.144 --> 01:44:27.626]  When it actually tried to implement
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.106]  It's incredibly anti-human agenda.
[01:44:33.188 --> 01:44:36.173]  You know, I don't spend valuable time on air.
[01:44:37.435 --> 01:44:49.102]  Showing you the infrastructure here, showing you what goes into it, showing you how much money it costs to run this and do this, especially since we were deplatformed one year ago today.
[01:44:49.382 --> 01:44:55.605]  That's why we're calling it the one-year anniversary of the first domino to be unpersoned, to be sent into a black hole, the Phantom Zone.
[01:44:55.665 --> 01:44:57.606]  But the globalists did it too early.
[01:44:57.626 --> 01:45:05.091]  There's still talk radio, there's still TV, there's still independent websites like Infowars.com and Newswars.com that are on the air.
[01:45:06.231 --> 01:45:17.198]  And people have word of mouth to say, hey, just because you can't say Alex Jones's name on Facebook, unless it's a negative statement, or can't show InfoWars.com, you can tell your office about InfoWars.com.
[01:45:17.719 --> 01:45:19.620]  You can tell your neighbors about NewsWars.com.
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:22.221]  You could share our videos and our articles.
[01:45:22.241 --> 01:45:22.942]  We have our own site.
[01:45:22.962 --> 01:45:23.702]  We have our own platform.
[01:45:24.923 --> 01:45:27.385]  That's the beauty of what's happening here.
[01:45:27.425 --> 01:45:30.607]  That's the beauty of what's unfolding.
[01:45:31.307 --> 01:45:32.368]  And it's a real fight.
[01:45:33.516 --> 01:45:38.859]  And things aren't going to go the way this whole synthetic technocracy want them to go, because you've been standing in the gap.
[01:45:39.639 --> 01:45:40.559]  You've been spreading the word.
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:41.780]  You've been praying.
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:43.761]  You've been supporting this transmission.
[01:45:43.841 --> 01:45:44.981]  You've been buying products from us.
[01:45:45.001 --> 01:45:47.242]  So it's the one-year anniversary.
[01:45:47.362 --> 01:45:48.823]  It's storewide, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:48.903 --> 01:45:49.463]  Free shipping.
[01:45:49.663 --> 01:45:52.185]  It's double Patriot points on your next order.

[01:45:54.366 --> 01:45:55.166]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:45:55.986 --> 01:45:56.187]  56% off.
[01:45:56.267 --> 01:45:57.127]  Double Patriot points.
[01:45:57.247 --> 01:45:59.508]  And there's a bunch of other big specials on storable food.
[01:45:59.528 --> 01:46:02.429]  The anniversary sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:04.550]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the site.

[01:46:11.254 --> 01:46:14.095]  It is such a revolutionary act to keep this broadcast on air.
[01:46:14.275 --> 01:46:15.515]  It is such a revolutionary act.
[01:46:15.655 --> 01:46:30.880]  Every time you put a bumper sticker on your car, or paintinfowars.com on the side of your barn, every time you stand up to leftist police, every time you tell the truth, every time you keep this symbol of free speech and pro-human values alive, the enemy comes one step closer to their system falling.
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:34.641]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[01:46:35.421 --> 01:46:39.502]  And now we've got a fighting chance, if we all take action, of defeating the globalists.
[01:46:39.922 --> 01:46:40.382]  Stay with us.
[01:46:40.602 --> 01:46:41.202]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:41.222 --> 01:46:42.843]  But please take advantage of the sale.
[01:47:06.678 --> 01:47:09.419]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:17.521 --> 01:47:28.225]  Alright, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:47:28.245 --> 01:47:31.966]  If you're a TV viewer, you see a live set feed coming into our news center in Central Texas.
[01:47:33.291 --> 01:47:36.793]  From far, far west Texas, El Paso.
[01:47:38.054 --> 01:47:40.236]  Talk about a romantic looking town and area.
[01:47:40.256 --> 01:47:42.517]  It looks like the wild, wild west when you're there.
[01:47:43.858 --> 01:47:45.840]  I think you're in the middle of an old western.
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:52.064]  And right over that border is the most dangerous city in all of Mexico.
[01:47:53.645 --> 01:47:56.047]  And Trump thinks we should have a wall there.
[01:47:56.867 --> 01:47:57.768]  Well, there is a wall there.
[01:47:57.788 --> 01:48:00.350]  It was there before he ever got in office.
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:04.021]  Obama and all of them said the exact same things Trump said.
[01:48:05.042 --> 01:48:07.623]  Now that Trump's in, oh no, he's evil.
[01:48:08.564 --> 01:48:11.826]  I want to rush through your calls because there's a lot of them and I'm sure they're all excellent.
[01:48:11.866 --> 01:48:19.670]  Just briefly, seriously, I don't want to say we're treading water because I've found ways to cut things and do certain things.
[01:48:21.187 --> 01:48:26.209]  Do this and that to still fund our operation, but man, if we had more money, we could sure hurt the globalists a lot worse.
[01:48:26.329 --> 01:48:28.850]  Plus, our supplements are the very best.
[01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:32.191]  Our water filtration, our air filtration, it's all really excellent.
[01:48:32.531 --> 01:48:39.873]  The non-human heirloom seeds, the shortwave radios, the t-shirts, the books, the films, the Betsy Ross flag shirts, all of it is at mfullmorestore.com.
[01:48:39.993 --> 01:48:45.195]  And we're extending last week's big sale because they reminded me, they said, hey,
[01:48:47.574 --> 01:48:54.557]  The 6th, yesterday, is the anniversary of you getting banned to set the precedent for the Global Chinese Social Credit Score.
[01:48:55.537 --> 01:48:56.418]  You ought to make that point.
[01:48:57.258 --> 01:48:58.758]  Here we are, a year later, still fighting.
[01:48:58.778 --> 01:48:59.499]  Thanks for your support.
[01:49:00.219 --> 01:49:01.960]  Let me tell you, these are products you need.
[01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:04.401]  So get your Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:49:05.061 --> 01:49:05.181]  60% off.
[01:49:05.201 --> 01:49:05.841]  We've never done that.
[01:49:05.861 --> 01:49:06.942]  Even though it's a great seller.
[01:49:08.019 --> 01:49:17.423]  I want you to experience how amazing the stuff is, and I'm not going to get into everything it's in, but Real Red Pill Plus, Survival Shield X2, DNA Force Plus back in stock.
[01:49:17.503 --> 01:49:18.404]  It's massively discounted.
[01:49:18.784 --> 01:49:20.965]  Ultra 12, Turbo Force is amazing.
[01:49:21.345 --> 01:49:22.465]  The protein bars are back.
[01:49:22.926 --> 01:49:23.786]  The coffee's great.
[01:49:24.266 --> 01:49:26.387]  Just find out about each and every one of them for yourself.
[01:49:26.647 --> 01:49:35.391]  I had an earache this weekend because I didn't wash my ears out after I swam in the lake, and it's the hot part of the summer.
[01:49:36.764 --> 01:49:43.010]  And I just went and found some cologne, because I didn't have any alcohol, poured it in my ear.
[01:49:43.150 --> 01:49:44.612]  It only partially killed the bacteria.
[01:49:46.073 --> 01:49:55.763]  I got home the next day, because I was out at the lake, and I found a little silver from Infowarsstore.com, a little quarter bottle we had left, dumped it in my ear.
[01:49:56.324 --> 01:49:59.026]  Within 10 minutes, the bacteria were dead.
[01:49:59.046 --> 01:50:00.688]  The pain was gone, baby.
[01:50:01.690 --> 01:50:04.151]  And I'm not a tough guy, but I can handle a little pain.
[01:50:04.471 --> 01:50:09.053]  Well, maybe I am a little tough, but the point is, is that I was taking Advil.
[01:50:09.293 --> 01:50:10.433]  It was hurting so bad that night.
[01:50:12.754 --> 01:50:15.415]  And, I mean, 10 minutes, just bye-bye, dead.
[01:50:16.295 --> 01:50:18.876]  The cologne, you know, that has alcohol in it, didn't do it.
[01:50:19.176 --> 01:50:21.837]  It knocked it about halfway out, then later it came back.
[01:50:21.877 --> 01:50:23.217]  The bacteria, like, powered through it.
[01:50:23.638 --> 01:50:26.258]  That silver hit him, double X's, baby.
[01:50:26.519 --> 01:50:27.439]  Dead as a doornail.
[01:50:29.614 --> 01:50:33.255]  InfoWarshore.com has what is rated the safest 30 parts per million.
[01:50:33.555 --> 01:50:34.615]  You can get it even stronger.
[01:50:34.635 --> 01:50:36.056]  I don't recommend you take that.
[01:50:37.656 --> 01:50:38.456]  You shouldn't ingest it.
[01:50:38.996 --> 01:50:40.777]  It kills bacteria and viruses for a reason.
[01:50:41.357 --> 01:50:41.817]  It's poison.
[01:50:42.737 --> 01:50:45.178]  It's good poison, but it's poison.
[01:50:45.858 --> 01:50:52.860]  So we sell what is the studied most recommended to be that good medium between 30 parts per million from the top lab in the country.
[01:50:54.875 --> 01:50:56.336]  Like super silver wound gel.
[01:50:56.896 --> 01:50:59.117]  That is the strongest over-the-counter silver you can get.
[01:50:59.297 --> 01:51:03.039]  Do not ingest that if you value your kidneys and your liver.
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:10.243]  But let me tell you, it works like a ton of bricks on topical stuff.
[01:51:10.704 --> 01:51:11.804]  It's strong.
[01:51:12.785 --> 01:51:13.745]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[01:51:14.406 --> 01:51:19.949]  John in Delaware, Kenneth, Tracy, Carlos, Bill, Chase the Patriot, Rick, Brad, who's been home the longest here?
[01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:23.521]  That would be John in Delaware.
[01:51:23.541 --> 01:51:24.241]  Thanks for calling, sir.
[01:51:24.261 --> 01:51:24.622]  Go ahead.
[01:51:26.222 --> 01:51:26.843]  Hey, Alex.
[01:51:26.923 --> 01:51:27.383]  Can you hear me?
[01:51:27.683 --> 01:51:28.043]  Yes, sir.
[01:51:29.304 --> 01:51:30.405]  I just want to start off.
[01:51:30.505 --> 01:51:40.310]  I'm just I'm absolutely disgusted and pissed off with these people and this stuff with all this, you know, gun control stuff.
[01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:46.733]  And I just think that we have to find a way to get the real facts out there.
[01:51:47.853 --> 01:51:50.815]  Yet, you know, somehow just with the
[01:51:52.064 --> 01:51:56.725]  The amount of long guns that are used, you know, it's 3.7 percent.
[01:51:56.765 --> 01:51:58.786]  Oh, that's the whole other area.
[01:51:58.806 --> 01:52:01.006]  200,000 dead in Mexico.
[01:52:01.106 --> 01:52:03.707]  Thousands of mass graves right across the border in El Paso.
[01:52:04.307 --> 01:52:06.428]  Heads dumped off at the police station all the time.
[01:52:06.708 --> 01:52:07.588]  Reporters killed.
[01:52:07.748 --> 01:52:08.808]  None of it gets covered.
[01:52:09.268 --> 01:52:09.788]  Oh, no.
[01:52:09.808 --> 01:52:11.629]  Go ahead.
[01:52:14.009 --> 01:52:20.531]  No, I mean, Beto's out on the news saying that the United States, that we lead the world in gun deaths,
[01:52:21.135 --> 01:52:28.041]  And we have .6 per 100,000, you know, dying of murder.
[01:52:28.081 --> 01:52:31.023]  No, we're not even in the top 20 countries for gun deaths.
[01:52:31.183 --> 01:52:32.785]  I mean, my God, that is asinine.
[01:52:32.825 --> 01:52:33.425]  And they know that.
[01:52:33.465 --> 01:52:38.730]  What we have is a gang problem in certain areas, and we have about 100 people a year getting killed in mass shootings.
[01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:42.292]  It's a tragedy, but the media hypes it, just like shark attacks.
[01:52:42.673 --> 01:52:44.915]  The average person, as I've said, is scared to death.
[01:52:45.535 --> 01:52:45.655]  Right.
[01:52:45.675 --> 01:52:47.256]  Well, my question to you is, what can we do
[01:53:14.687 --> 01:53:18.110]  To just stop these people.
[01:53:18.651 --> 01:53:27.261]  I think maybe if Trump even came out and laid out the real statistics in this country with the gun stuff,
[01:53:28.056 --> 01:53:34.179]  I mean, there's got to be some way where these people, you know, all these Democrats, they go on all these shows.
[01:53:34.239 --> 01:53:41.043]  Well, they know what they're doing, and Trump knows it's all emotional, so he doesn't want to get in a statistic fight with them, because it'll sound like he doesn't care about the 20 dead.
[01:53:41.063 --> 01:53:44.324]  I mean, it was your mama or your brother that got killed by this guy.
[01:53:44.545 --> 01:53:50.668]  By the way, this guy is autistic, didn't know where he was, told police he went to Walmart,
[01:53:51.601 --> 01:53:52.282]  To get food.
[01:53:52.522 --> 01:53:55.405]  They all report other shooters in solid black.
[01:53:55.725 --> 01:53:57.527]  Didn't have any other clips on him.
[01:53:58.148 --> 01:54:01.771]  And then he turned himself into police down the road.
[01:54:02.112 --> 01:54:03.673]  And that's why they didn't beat the hell out of him.
[01:54:03.693 --> 01:54:07.177]  Because they weren't even sure it was him when he walked up to him.
[01:54:07.897 --> 01:54:10.320]  So does any of that sound like it's legitimate to you?
[01:54:12.325 --> 01:54:13.707]  It's the same old story.
[01:54:13.807 --> 01:54:15.349]  It's the crazy-looking guy.
[01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:19.294]  It's, you know, reports of one thing from the people that were on the ground.
[01:54:19.655 --> 01:54:22.098]  Then you hear a whole different spin.
[01:54:22.138 --> 01:54:23.680]  Sure, and they'll argue.
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:24.581]  They'll argue well.
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:26.381]  No, I sure don't.
[01:54:26.401 --> 01:54:27.982]  I mean, and it's going to keep
[01:54:51.863 --> 01:54:52.423]  Happening.
[01:54:52.464 --> 01:54:53.704]  They keep hyping it up.
[01:54:53.765 --> 01:54:54.785]  They keep hyping it up.
[01:54:55.106 --> 01:54:56.386]  We're up here in Delaware.
[01:54:56.767 --> 01:54:59.949]  We just fought a big gun ban thing a few months ago.
[01:55:00.289 --> 01:55:09.797]  Now, we already have some of our representatives after this, you know, calling to call to reintroduce it again this year when it just all got voted down.
[01:55:09.837 --> 01:55:17.983]  We all went exactly we put up and they're just using it and using it and I just think that there we have to find a way
[01:55:18.652 --> 01:55:22.794]  To just shut their argument down and just stick it right up their ass.
[01:55:23.215 --> 01:55:23.715]  No, I agree.
[01:55:23.875 --> 01:55:24.655]  God bless you, brother.
[01:55:26.436 --> 01:55:27.737]  Let me just say this about all this.
[01:55:28.978 --> 01:55:29.838]  And I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:55:30.699 --> 01:55:33.781]  And I hate to give my ideas, but believe me, they're run by Alexander Soros.
[01:55:34.361 --> 01:55:35.141]  We've got the documents.
[01:55:35.161 --> 01:55:36.142]  That's who funds Antifa.
[01:55:39.244 --> 01:55:46.728]  If they're smart, and these guys are nihilistic suicide heads, that the guy that attacked the ICE facility said he wanted to die three weeks ago,
[01:55:49.562 --> 01:55:51.884]  They will go and attack and say they're right wingers.
[01:55:53.205 --> 01:55:55.487]  Well, they first said the guy in Dayton was a right winger.
[01:55:55.527 --> 01:55:59.450]  No, he was an avowed lover of Satan.
[01:55:59.470 --> 01:56:04.634]  He had lyrics about wanting to have sex with Satan and how to rape women and drink women's blood.
[01:56:04.714 --> 01:56:06.315]  I mean, I'm not going to read all this to you on air.
[01:56:06.395 --> 01:56:07.536]  It's bad.
[01:56:08.016 --> 01:56:09.017]  They took all the videos down.
[01:56:10.258 --> 01:56:13.821]  But he had a devil worship band about raping women.
[01:56:14.764 --> 01:56:17.426]  And drinking menstrual fluid and just stuff I'm not gonna even say.
[01:56:18.067 --> 01:56:18.987]  I'm already saying some of it.
[01:56:19.327 --> 01:56:22.050]  And of course it was screwing kids and it's all the same crap.
[01:56:22.110 --> 01:56:22.690]  It's the spirit.
[01:56:23.070 --> 01:56:25.012]  Take one damn look at that guy's eyes.
[01:56:25.372 --> 01:56:27.734]  I said the first day, that's a devil worshipper.
[01:56:28.434 --> 01:56:31.757]  I went on air Sunday and I said, that's a devil worshipper.
[01:56:32.297 --> 01:56:33.698]  And he's a devil worshipper.
[01:56:34.399 --> 01:56:36.260]  You know what devil worshippers look like?
[01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:39.543]  Weak little pieces of crap with demon eyes.
[01:56:42.267 --> 01:56:46.428]  He was a porno grind band that released songs about raping and killing women.
[01:56:46.448 --> 01:56:47.248]  Yeah, there's the headlines.
[01:56:47.308 --> 01:56:48.908]  I'm not even going to read the transcripts of this.
[01:56:50.049 --> 01:56:52.609]  Look, these people want to rape babies, okay?
[01:56:52.769 --> 01:56:53.789]  I mean, it's real simple.
[01:56:54.089 --> 01:56:54.910]  They love Satan.
[01:56:55.150 --> 01:56:56.190]  They want to kill babies.
[01:56:56.230 --> 01:56:57.710]  They've told me this to my face.
[01:56:57.970 --> 01:57:02.331]  I go to Democrat events, they walk up and go, I love Satan, I'm going to kill you to kill babies.
[01:57:03.731 --> 01:57:05.752]  And you're like, oh, they're just doing that to freak me out.
[01:57:05.932 --> 01:57:08.232]  No, we've infiltrated their groups.
[01:57:10.073 --> 01:57:11.113]  That's what they do at the meetings.
[01:57:12.329 --> 01:57:12.469]  I don't
[01:57:30.839 --> 01:57:32.380]  I haven't even gotten to the big story.
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:36.763]  They have that FBI guy who goes on TV and says that Trump is a white supremacist.
[01:57:36.783 --> 01:57:39.966]  He says Trump lowered the flags for Hitler.
[01:57:40.466 --> 01:57:41.307]  I'm not joking.
[01:57:41.767 --> 01:57:43.128]  That clip and your calls is coming up.
[01:57:43.168 --> 01:57:45.490]  And then our special guest, Mr. Passio.
[01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:47.411]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:57:47.852 --> 01:57:48.732]  Infowars.com.
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:58:08.348]  You know, the top Nazi, Wernher von Braun, wrote a 1959 book, or 1949 book, I'm going for memory here, called Project Mars, where the Elons are the aliens who end up taking over the Earth.
[01:58:08.528 --> 01:58:11.970]  Beware the Elon and the Elon invasion.
[01:58:12.230 --> 01:58:13.571]  Dr. Wernher von Braun.
[01:58:13.731 --> 01:58:14.392]  Wonder what he knew.
[01:58:14.552 --> 01:58:21.276]  When I watched his promo about this with executives from his company, they all look like they're on hardcore drugs.
[01:58:21.356 --> 01:58:24.198]  I mean, they're like sweating, their eyes are like lit up, like,
[01:58:25.836 --> 01:58:27.156]  I mean, they look nuts.
[01:58:27.537 --> 01:58:28.717]  You know when somebody's on drugs.
[01:58:28.837 --> 01:58:32.378]  You know, they admit Silicon Valley is into hardcore speed and hallucinogens.
[01:58:32.518 --> 01:58:35.959]  They're taking IV drips at work of DMT.
[01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:41.141]  They're taking LSD microdoses and psilocybin mushrooms and peyote every day!
[01:58:41.521 --> 01:58:42.782]  Who in the hell...
[01:58:43.382 --> 01:58:44.622]  would want to join with these people.
[01:58:44.722 --> 01:58:47.203]  I've seen people take like three hits of acid, their eyes aren't that big.
[01:58:47.263 --> 01:58:48.123]  What the hell are they on?
[01:58:48.263 --> 01:59:02.946]  And one of the crew members said maybe they've already got this whole Neuralink virus hooks in their brain because as PKD pointed out, Philip K. Dick back in the 70s, the cyberpunk future is where you can get any type of pleasure you want, just plug in, but no one wants to even get up or eat for weeks or days.
[01:59:02.966 --> 01:59:06.466]  You just die because you just plug all this in and it's the Matrix.
[01:59:06.687 --> 01:59:08.907]  And now the Matrix is here and you look at Tim Cook,
[01:59:09.147 --> 01:59:13.669]  Or Elon Musk or any of his executives when they're up there on that stage, they'll be under white lights.
[01:59:13.869 --> 01:59:16.330]  Their pupils are 90% open.
[01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:19.271]  Zuckerberg, all of them, these people either have brain chips.
[01:59:19.491 --> 01:59:19.951]  That's it.
[01:59:20.331 --> 01:59:22.432]  These guys are wireheads.
[01:59:22.612 --> 01:59:24.113]  Something's going on.
[01:59:24.393 --> 01:59:28.535]  I'm in here underneath bright lights and my pupils are very little.
[01:59:28.655 --> 01:59:29.515]  Now zoom in if you can.
[01:59:29.555 --> 01:59:31.436]  My pupils are tiny because I'm not on drugs.
[01:59:32.136 --> 01:59:33.417]  I've had two cups of coffee today.
[01:59:33.577 --> 01:59:35.277]  So here, let me show you my pupils, okay?
[01:59:35.477 --> 01:59:36.698]  My pupils are little.
[01:59:36.758 --> 01:59:37.898]  They're supposed to close!
[01:59:38.058 --> 01:59:40.979]  That's what happens under the sun or under bright lights, but not these guys.
[01:59:41.039 --> 01:59:46.601]  These are drug addicts, and they want the hit of wires in their brains, and all of them got those giant pupils.
[01:59:47.782 --> 01:59:50.003]  Because they've been there, and they ain't coming back.
[01:59:55.365 --> 02:00:01.287]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.302 --> 02:00:18.863]  Woo!
[02:00:18.883 --> 02:00:19.543]  We're live!
[02:00:19.784 --> 02:00:21.766]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:00:22.086 --> 02:00:23.888]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[02:00:24.508 --> 02:00:26.130]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.091 --> 02:00:28.653]  It's alive!
[02:00:28.773 --> 02:00:30.775]  It's alive!
[02:00:31.275 --> 02:00:32.977]  It's alive!
[02:00:33.878 --> 02:00:36.080]  One year after their total war against us.
[02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:41.466]  Hell, I've been antagonist forever, but... One year after their mega-massive offensive.
[02:00:42.657 --> 02:00:43.077]  We're here.
[02:00:43.577 --> 02:00:44.558]  Still on air, thanks to you.
[02:00:44.578 --> 02:00:46.078]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[02:00:46.518 --> 02:00:47.679]  Taking your calls throughout the hour.
[02:00:48.079 --> 02:00:50.639]  First visit of Mark Passi, a really smart guy.
[02:00:50.659 --> 02:00:57.702]  I enjoyed some of his shows and research, and I don't do a lot of research myself, so I know a lot of it's very accurate, as I know it, and I've learned some stuff as well.
[02:00:58.162 --> 02:01:04.184]  So he's going to be riding shotgun with us, and hopefully come down to town sometime to be in studio with us, because I want to get more and more guests in studio.
[02:01:04.444 --> 02:01:05.684]  He's going to be joining us coming up.
[02:01:06.084 --> 02:01:07.925]  Let's go back to your phone calls right now.
[02:01:07.945 --> 02:01:11.926]  I'm also going to play this deep state FBI agent, former agent.
[02:01:12.566 --> 02:01:15.168]  Who just ups the ante every day with outrageous stuff.
[02:01:15.208 --> 02:01:20.772]  He says Trump lowered the flags to half-mast to hail Hitler.
[02:01:21.613 --> 02:01:22.193]  Don't believe me?
[02:01:22.213 --> 02:01:23.675]  Gonna show you the clip.
[02:01:23.715 --> 02:01:24.195]  Next segment.
[02:01:25.656 --> 02:01:26.937]  I'm wondering where I'm gonna go next with this.
[02:01:26.977 --> 02:01:27.998]  This is just getting insane.
[02:01:28.498 --> 02:01:36.244]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to... Hmm... Kevin in New Hampshire.
[02:01:36.284 --> 02:01:37.065]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[02:01:37.165 --> 02:01:37.425]  Thanks.
[02:01:37.445 --> 02:01:37.825]  Go ahead.
[02:01:39.767 --> 02:01:40.147]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:40.608 --> 02:01:41.428]  Great job for taking my call.
[02:01:43.359 --> 02:01:44.260]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call.
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:47.801]  First thing I want to say is thanks a lot for your smile shield, X2, man.
[02:01:47.962 --> 02:01:52.624]  I try to take it every day, sometimes I forget, but every time I do, I feel great.
[02:01:52.724 --> 02:01:54.805]  Sometimes that actually works better than a cup of coffee.
[02:01:54.845 --> 02:01:55.346]  It's amazing.
[02:01:57.107 --> 02:02:04.831]  Well, I got to tell you, I got told by Dr. Group eight years ago, when he first visited here, he goes, listen, I'm working on this special isolated type.
[02:02:04.851 --> 02:02:05.551]  We actually absorb it.
[02:02:05.571 --> 02:02:07.292]  It's from, you know, nobody else has it.
[02:02:07.312 --> 02:02:10.634]  And if you take it, you'll go through a big detox and all this stuff, but it'll change your life.
[02:02:11.094 --> 02:02:11.935]  And I actually took it.
[02:02:12.987 --> 02:02:13.608]  Absolutely.
[02:02:13.628 --> 02:02:16.511]  Quick question before I get to what I'm calling about.
[02:02:16.551 --> 02:02:18.593]  Are you guys going to be at the Manchester-New Hampshire rally on the 15th?
[02:02:33.911 --> 02:02:38.913]  We've got four reporters that rove the U.S., and they're at most events, and I believe they will be there.
[02:02:38.933 --> 02:02:40.113]  We're trying to hire more.
[02:02:40.153 --> 02:02:42.034]  We've actually hired three more reporters.
[02:02:42.054 --> 02:02:43.295]  They're getting trained and ready right now.
[02:02:43.315 --> 02:02:51.358]  We've got a bunch of expansions that are going to be announced very soon, including lawsuits against the globalists, new shows, and then a bunch of covert operations we're running that we can't talk about.
[02:02:53.553 --> 02:02:54.994]  Right, I understand, and that's awesome.
[02:02:55.034 --> 02:02:55.894]  I'll be looking for you guys.
[02:02:56.335 --> 02:03:00.757]  Brother, you are, you understand, you are, without you, you are the operation.
[02:03:01.297 --> 02:03:02.238]  You are doing this.
[02:03:02.718 --> 02:03:05.380]  So don't say, hey, thank you guys, thank you.
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.941]  You understand, don't get this ass backwards, Kevin.
[02:03:08.281 --> 02:03:09.562]  You are the reason we're here.
[02:03:09.582 --> 02:03:14.244]  All right, and I appreciate that, Alex.
[02:03:15.105 --> 02:03:15.965]  Here's my theory.
[02:03:15.985 --> 02:03:22.269]  I was both listening yesterday, and I also played back, just in case I missed anything, your show from yesterday.
[02:03:23.368 --> 02:03:28.529]  And you're asking, how do you think they're going to strike back with this proxy war we got with China?
[02:03:28.609 --> 02:03:36.812]  Well, we know now, Alex, that the Chi-Coms are the ones behind Antifa, and both of these shooters were Antifa.
[02:03:36.832 --> 02:03:43.133]  They used that through the Confucius Institute, radicalizing our professors and students, and all Antifa are college professors and students.
[02:03:44.133 --> 02:03:45.974]  So do you think it's possible
[02:03:46.913 --> 02:03:47.834]  Absolutely.
[02:03:47.874 --> 02:03:51.976]  I mean, we know our own CIA is compromised by the globalists, which all connects back to China, and...
[02:04:16.443 --> 02:04:17.404]  Absolutely.
[02:04:17.464 --> 02:04:22.888]  And, you know, I don't know how much stock you put in this guy, but I mean, he wrote a lot of good stuff and he did come out against you.
[02:04:22.948 --> 02:04:23.629]  He's dead now.
[02:04:23.649 --> 02:04:26.651]  That Bill Cooper guy, he talked about this, how they would be all be on SSRIs.
[02:04:45.643 --> 02:04:51.804]  And on that same page, it's now a meme now all over the internet, that paragraph out of his book, Behold a Pale Horse.
[02:04:51.984 --> 02:04:53.645]  No, I think William Cooper did a lot of great stuff.
[02:04:54.445 --> 02:04:56.905]  He talked about the Chi-Coms, SSRIs, a lot of smart stuff.
[02:04:57.205 --> 02:04:58.006]  I was ever against Cooper.
[02:04:58.026 --> 02:04:58.806]  I interviewed him a few times.
[02:04:59.206 --> 02:05:00.786]  He just got jealous of the show.
[02:05:01.226 --> 02:05:01.806]  And that's okay.
[02:05:04.867 --> 02:05:07.367]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor.
[02:05:08.088 --> 02:05:09.648]  But I still need my morning coffee.
[02:05:11.027 --> 02:05:19.612]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:05:20.433 --> 02:05:31.380]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[02:05:32.060 --> 02:05:36.263]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[02:05:37.183 --> 02:05:40.384]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[02:05:41.204 --> 02:05:46.285]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[02:05:48.106 --> 02:05:50.226]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[02:05:51.026 --> 02:06:00.729]  Sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:05.316 --> 02:06:09.362]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:06:10.143 --> 02:06:11.585]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:11.845 --> 02:06:13.027]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:13.488 --> 02:06:18.134]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:27.845 --> 02:06:35.787]  By the way, playing this song from the Motor City Madman, now in transplant in Texas, reminds me it's time to get Uncle Ted back on.
[02:06:35.807 --> 02:06:36.888]  He says he'll come in studio.
[02:06:37.928 --> 02:06:40.268]  Let's go pick him up north of Austin and drive his ass down here.
[02:06:41.169 --> 02:06:42.909]  He's amazing in person, Ted Nugent.
[02:06:44.410 --> 02:06:46.010]  I think we got the Globalist in a stranglehold.
[02:06:46.110 --> 02:06:49.971]  Okay, so I've known about Mark Passer a couple years, watching his stuff.
[02:06:50.391 --> 02:06:52.852]  My wife listens to it a lot, and I was listening to it a few weeks ago in the car.
[02:06:52.872 --> 02:06:54.252]  I said, well, I gotta get that guy on.
[02:06:54.292 --> 02:06:56.053]  And then by the time I got a hold of him,
[02:06:57.273 --> 02:06:59.814]  All hell broke loose last week, so we rescheduled him twice.
[02:07:00.154 --> 02:07:04.877]  And I've canceled most guests, by the way, because obviously they're trying to trigger a civil war right now.
[02:07:04.917 --> 02:07:06.878]  But I wanted to get into natural law.
[02:07:07.398 --> 02:07:10.759]  And I want to get him back on about his view on fake Christians, because it's lined up with mine.
[02:07:10.779 --> 02:07:12.100]  And he's just a smart guy.
[02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:13.541]  WhatOnEarthIsHappening.com.
[02:07:14.101 --> 02:07:17.082]  He's an independent researcher, public speaker from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
[02:07:17.443 --> 02:07:24.206]  The past 12 years, his work has been to teach the universal spiritual laws of morality, upon which all human freedom depends.
[02:07:24.706 --> 02:07:26.007]  So it's a good point just to ask,
[02:07:26.767 --> 02:07:27.827]  What is natural law?
[02:07:27.987 --> 02:07:30.828]  And then just project it onto what's happening now.
[02:07:31.309 --> 02:07:33.289]  The Democrats are breaking natural law.
[02:07:33.329 --> 02:07:35.090]  They're at war with natural law.
[02:07:35.550 --> 02:07:44.413]  They're at war with the very reality of the universe, like the French Revolution claimed it was to enlighten, but it was really trying to bring in a total dark age.
[02:07:44.433 --> 02:07:46.014]  And what does it do to natural law?
[02:07:46.034 --> 02:07:47.614]  We'll play this at the end of the segment.
[02:07:48.135 --> 02:07:51.776]  Have former high-level FBI agent, counter-terrorism,
[02:07:53.240 --> 02:08:02.660]  Come out fig-la-zoo-zy or however you say his name, every day it's a new thing, and say that Trump lowered the flags to say, Howl Hitler!
[02:08:04.412 --> 02:08:25.085]  And then what he does is he projects mental illness onto it, knowing the type of mentally ill people out there who now don't have any consciousness, don't have any rudder, don't have any basis in reality, don't have any natural law, don't have any compass, don't have any ways to differentiate, now just look for fantasy land because, oh, the flags go up on one day,
[02:08:25.825 --> 02:08:35.291]  And they go down a few days later on 8-8, that means Heil Hitler, because some weird obscure group said that in prison.
[02:08:35.952 --> 02:08:45.578]  And so now the FBI is popularizing not just mom and dad is bad, not just the American flag is racist, not just nationalism is evil, but now
[02:08:46.894 --> 02:08:49.138]  Now the word 88 is bad.
[02:08:49.159 --> 02:08:55.030]  You know we got a crew member named Drew and he wears a Drew Pearson Dallas Cowboys 88.
[02:08:55.872 --> 02:08:57.815]  Was Drew Pearson a worshipper of Hitler?
[02:08:59.815 --> 02:09:12.062]  It's this mind control of projecting onto everything that this symbol, which means everything's going well, in scuba diving or in welding or in, you know, for astronauts, this means A-OK.
[02:09:13.123 --> 02:09:13.563]  OK.
[02:09:13.983 --> 02:09:16.245]  Well, that's now, you know, white supremism.
[02:09:16.605 --> 02:09:19.867]  This attempt to attack language and to destroy language.
[02:09:20.347 --> 02:09:22.268]  Where do you think it's all going?
[02:09:22.308 --> 02:09:24.009]  So, Mark Passio, thanks for joining us.
[02:09:24.029 --> 02:09:28.552]  I apologize for rescheduling you, but it's been a crazy period.
[02:09:29.423 --> 02:09:29.884]  No worries.
[02:09:29.944 --> 02:09:31.146]  I completely understand, Alex.
[02:09:31.206 --> 02:09:33.329]  I want to say thank you for bringing me onto the show.
[02:09:33.369 --> 02:09:34.290]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[02:09:36.694 --> 02:09:39.758]  What you talk about natural law is so simple but also so complex.
[02:09:40.079 --> 02:09:41.481]  Quantify why it's so important.
[02:09:42.796 --> 02:09:52.903]  Well, I mean, the first thing is I'd like to clear up what natural law is not, because a lot of people have a, you know, mental definition that's quite different than what it really is.
[02:09:53.723 --> 02:09:58.887]  Natural law is definitely not and has absolutely nothing to do with Darwinism.
[02:09:59.507 --> 02:10:10.175]  It has absolutely nothing to do with the so-called survival of the fittest, or the so-called law of the jungle, or what people often term as the so-called natural order.
[02:10:10.755 --> 02:10:15.043]  You know, these have nothing to do with what I'm referring to when I talk about natural law.
[02:10:15.543 --> 02:10:23.597]  Natural law is cosmic spiritual law of creation that is all about objective morality.
[02:10:24.207 --> 02:10:40.860]  It's a set of universal, inherent, objective, non-man-made, eternal and unchangeable conditions that actually govern the consequences of the behaviors that we choose through our own free will.
[02:10:41.601 --> 02:10:43.242]  That's what natural law really is.
[02:10:43.262 --> 02:10:44.283]  So it's God's law?
[02:10:45.003 --> 02:10:46.905]  It's absolutely God's law.
[02:10:47.125 --> 02:10:51.228]  That's probably the best term for it that it's been called over human history.
[02:10:51.308 --> 02:10:53.230]  This is God's law, not man's law.
[02:10:54.867 --> 02:10:59.790]  And, you know, freedom depends on whether we understand it objectively or not.
[02:11:00.170 --> 02:11:04.593]  Whether we understand which behaviors are actually moral behaviors.
[02:11:04.653 --> 02:11:12.778]  Why is Satan, or why are these evil people at war with natural law when it gives you freedom and prosperity and empowerment?
[02:11:13.530 --> 02:11:18.976]  Well, as you know, the highest level globalists and social engineers of our world are Satanists.
[02:11:19.116 --> 02:11:21.179]  They are Satanists and dark Luciferians.
[02:11:21.219 --> 02:11:24.362]  They are dark occultists, as I refer to them.
[02:11:24.763 --> 02:11:27.326]  And they want to turn God's law on its head.
[02:11:27.546 --> 02:11:30.670]  They want to reign in hell rather than rule in heaven.
[02:11:31.190 --> 02:11:42.717]  What they want to do is become the actual rulers of Earth and turn Earth into a prison and then rule over that prison because they don't want to abide by the laws of morality.
[02:11:43.077 --> 02:11:44.278]  They want to be God.
[02:11:44.378 --> 02:11:46.159]  That's what Satanism is actually really about.
[02:11:46.179 --> 02:11:50.242]  And that's incredibly key because they know other people are going to escape it and find natural law.
[02:11:50.722 --> 02:11:52.123]  That's why I call it a prison planet.
[02:11:52.143 --> 02:11:56.846]  They're obsessed with building a prison of false reality, hoping they can trick us to serve them.
[02:11:57.566 --> 02:12:00.969]  That is absolutely what they are doing, without a doubt.
[02:12:01.109 --> 02:12:06.474]  And see, it all hinges on confusing people about what objective morality is.
[02:12:06.975 --> 02:12:13.441]  See, if people are confused about objective morality, then they can't bring their behavior into alignment with natural law.
[02:12:13.601 --> 02:12:14.902]  So describe that for people.
[02:12:14.942 --> 02:12:15.463]  That's critical.
[02:12:16.112 --> 02:12:20.413]  Yeah, there's a law in the universe known as the Law of Freedom, as I refer to it.
[02:12:20.834 --> 02:12:39.780]  And it's very simply that as the aggregate or collective morality of a species increases, as we collectively become more moral people because we're aligning our behavior to objective rights, meaning we are not doing actions that cause harm to other people, that's what wrongdoings are.
[02:12:40.300 --> 02:12:48.103]  And rights, which very few people can even define, are actions which do not initiate harm or violence to other beings.
[02:12:48.123 --> 02:12:52.284]  You know, most people can't even give the definition, a simple definition of a right.
[02:12:52.324 --> 02:12:53.725]  That's why we're losing our rights.
[02:12:54.185 --> 02:12:54.405]  Okay?
[02:12:54.465 --> 02:13:01.888]  So, if we don't bring our behavior into alignment with natural law, that becomes a complete source of chaos and disorder in the world.
[02:13:02.288 --> 02:13:04.310]  And we eventually go into enslavement.
[02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:14.297]  The law of freedom is basically that as the collective morality of a species increases, their collective freedom as a species increases.
[02:13:14.597 --> 02:13:26.505]  And as the collective morality of a species declines, and we go into immoral behaviors as an entire race of beings, then we go deeper and deeper into bondage and enslavement.
[02:13:26.545 --> 02:13:29.548]  This is what I refer to as the natural law of freedom.
[02:13:30.628 --> 02:13:34.451]  And the enemy knows that, and everything is set up to trick people into that process.
[02:13:34.891 --> 02:13:41.155]  And when you become corrupt, you can see people spiritually lose that spark in the eye and become like dumb slaves.
[02:13:41.415 --> 02:13:43.517]  The Bible talks about they're given over to great delusion.
[02:13:44.890 --> 02:13:55.156]  Without a doubt, and this is all about confusing people as to the actual behaviors that are moral versus the behaviors that are actually immoral.
[02:13:55.937 --> 02:14:05.903]  Most people have taken on the mindset of these dark occultists and Satanists by buying into what is known as moral relativism.
[02:14:06.423 --> 02:14:06.503]  It's
[02:14:24.821 --> 02:14:25.181]  Thank you.
[02:14:37.538 --> 02:14:38.038]  Exactly.
[02:14:38.158 --> 02:14:40.060]  They want to give us their mindset.
[02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:55.369]  Their mindset is this totally degraded, immoral mindset, and they want to spread that mindset through society, because only when people buy into a lesser version of these high-level, satanist mindsets, can they actually be controlled by them.
[02:14:55.529 --> 02:15:03.275]  And I've also noticed when I've had the top Democrats sue me and things, they really believe that we're evil like them and running scams.
[02:15:04.255 --> 02:15:06.277]  I've also noticed that that's how twisted they are.
[02:15:06.537 --> 02:15:08.218]  They really believe that all there is is evil.
[02:15:08.278 --> 02:15:08.799]  It's bizarre.
[02:15:09.778 --> 02:15:12.579]  Well, part of like what you said, it's about projection.
[02:15:12.999 --> 02:15:22.603]  The enemy always wants to project their own mindset onto other people and say that they're doing the same thing that they're actually doing and try to turn the tables like that.
[02:15:23.004 --> 02:15:32.147]  And they're going to be able to get away with that as long as the public doesn't wake up to the dangers of moral relativism and learn natural law.
[02:15:32.167 --> 02:15:33.608]  You know, it is not about
[02:15:34.588 --> 02:15:37.549]  We are not the arbitrators of what right and wrong are.
[02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:44.150]  We should be discovering those principles as they exist in nature, because they are inherent to nature.
[02:15:44.730 --> 02:15:46.331]  And all the occultists talk about magic.
[02:15:46.531 --> 02:15:47.591]  That's all a twisted form.
[02:15:47.611 --> 02:15:50.592]  If you really follow God's laws, the magic is immediate.
[02:15:51.112 --> 02:15:52.872]  And it's not magic, it's the way the universe works.
[02:15:52.912 --> 02:15:54.793]  It's the keys to destiny.
[02:15:54.813 --> 02:15:57.213]  We'll be back with Mark Passie of WhatOnEarthIsHappening.com.
[02:15:57.333 --> 02:15:59.314]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:15:59.374 --> 02:16:00.014]  Really smart guy.
[02:16:00.034 --> 02:16:01.054]  We're going to hear a lot more from him.
[02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:15.540]  There's this theory, I think it's called scatastic terrorism, which is the idea of a leader using the mass media to demonize a particular group, whether it's Jews or immigrants or whomever.
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:20.323]  And then what appears to be lone wolf
[02:16:21.244 --> 02:16:31.568]  Individual psychotics attacking that one group, where the individual attack is not predictable, but the general trend of it is predictable.
[02:16:31.748 --> 02:16:43.192]  I think that at the end of the day, especially because this was a white supremacist manifesto, that I want to say with more moral clarity that Donald Trump is responsible for this.
[02:16:43.832 --> 02:16:56.484]  I think the president has to bear some responsibility for creating a culture in the United States around race-baiting, around demonizing people of color, around demonizing immigrants.
[02:16:56.604 --> 02:17:00.568]  We have a president of the United States who has embraced white nationalism.
[02:17:00.728 --> 02:17:04.754]  And now, America is under attack from domestic white nationalist terror.
[02:17:04.894 --> 02:17:05.816]  White nationalist.
[02:17:05.856 --> 02:17:06.857]  White supremacist.
[02:17:07.017 --> 02:17:08.099]  Racist hatred.
[02:17:08.219 --> 02:17:09.100]  White nationalism.
[02:17:09.441 --> 02:17:10.302]  White nationalist violence.
[02:17:10.342 --> 02:17:12.125]  White nationalist terrorism.
[02:17:12.185 --> 02:17:13.066]  White nationalists.
[02:17:13.247 --> 02:17:14.028]  White nationalism.
[02:17:14.068 --> 02:17:15.590]  White nationalism.
[02:17:15.630 --> 02:17:16.632]  White nationalism.
[02:17:16.852 --> 02:17:18.493]  The president has stoked the flames.
[02:17:18.553 --> 02:17:19.613]  He has emboldened it.
[02:17:19.713 --> 02:17:21.154]  He has given it power.
[02:17:21.234 --> 02:17:22.315]  He has elevated it.
[02:17:23.135 --> 02:17:24.516]  He has coddled it.
[02:17:25.356 --> 02:17:26.717]  And he's got to stop.
[02:17:26.797 --> 02:17:29.498]  This is the environment that the president has created.
[02:17:29.538 --> 02:17:30.598]  He's made it okay.
[02:17:30.698 --> 02:17:40.583]  He is responsible for what is going on and is doing nothing, nothing to stop the carnage and the chaos.
[02:17:40.943 --> 02:17:44.445]  I'm incredibly saddened and it's very hard to think about this.
[02:17:46.326 --> 02:17:53.733]  Our president right now is using the same language of racism, of bigotry, and white supremacy.
[02:17:54.094 --> 02:17:54.834]  He is a racist.
[02:17:55.015 --> 02:17:59.599]  Donald Trump talks like a racist, thinks like a racist, makes statements like a racist.
[02:17:59.879 --> 02:18:02.962]  Yeah, he's a racist because racism is as racism does.
[02:18:03.222 --> 02:18:05.665]  He must be held responsible.
[02:18:05.845 --> 02:18:07.046]  It's a national embarrassment.
[02:18:07.066 --> 02:18:13.572]  I mean, who cares how strong our economy is, or how strong our military is, if Americans are killing Americans?
[02:18:13.592 --> 02:18:17.996]  When you read that manifesto, it looked like it could have been written by a Trump speechwriter.
[02:18:34.255 --> 02:18:36.016]  Laura in Alabama.
[02:18:36.096 --> 02:18:37.077]  Laura, you're on the air.
[02:18:37.137 --> 02:18:37.397]  Go ahead.
[02:19:04.155 --> 02:19:04.536]  Thank you, everybody.
[02:19:04.556 --> 02:19:09.845]  And everyone who wants to see this info war actually happen, have to put their money where their mouth is.
[02:19:09.905 --> 02:19:13.211]  So I ask everyone right now to go online and order some products.
[02:19:14.409 --> 02:19:17.212]  Well, thank you for your kind words, because take that wound gel.
[02:19:17.272 --> 02:19:19.053]  We're the only other company in the U.S.
[02:19:19.194 --> 02:19:23.317]  that has licensed it from the Colorado company that's very famous, that has FDA approval.
[02:19:23.457 --> 02:19:35.048]  It's used in hospitals, it's sold in pharmacies, and then we private label it as silver wound gel, which is a pre-gel, tiny bit, covers your hands, everything, and then disinfects all day long or put it on once
[02:19:35.408 --> 02:19:36.569]  You have a cut or something now.
[02:19:36.689 --> 02:19:39.850]  It's so super strong you can't take it internally or it's poisonous.
[02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:43.972]  But yes, it is the strongest FDA over-the-counter silver there is.
[02:19:44.032 --> 02:19:45.473]  So that is one of our best sellers.
[02:19:45.513 --> 02:19:46.453]  People absolutely love it.
[02:19:46.613 --> 02:19:46.933]  Thank you.
[02:19:47.073 --> 02:19:49.615]  And I can tell you this, my neighbor burned his finger a little bit.
[02:19:49.635 --> 02:19:56.378]  We're building a fire outside and I ran inside and got it and put it on his finger and he said to me, is this supposed to work instantly and like this?
[02:19:56.558 --> 02:19:57.658]  And I said, yep, sure does.
[02:19:57.758 --> 02:19:59.579]  So it's fantastic stuff.
[02:19:59.639 --> 02:20:00.680]  I highly recommend it.
[02:20:06.195 --> 02:20:08.796]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:21.912 --> 02:20:37.123]  Okay, let's go right back to Mark Passio, who we'll have back again, too, to get really into natural law and why the system is trying to overthrow it because they can't rule unless they sabotage you and basically cut your legs off to your psychological, spiritual cripple so they can rule over you.
[02:20:37.143 --> 02:20:38.925]  But I want to get his take on world events.
[02:20:38.965 --> 02:20:39.845]  Some of your calls coming up.
[02:20:39.865 --> 02:20:42.007]  Carlos Bill, Chase the Patriot, Rick Bradd.
[02:20:42.027 --> 02:20:44.068]  I promise before this hour ends, we'll get to you.
[02:20:45.229 --> 02:20:50.136]  Then coming up today in the fourth hour is Mike Adams of naturalnews.com.
[02:20:50.156 --> 02:20:52.139]  We might go ten minutes in or so with Mark if he can do it.
[02:20:52.660 --> 02:20:59.809]  Mike's always fine with that because he'll have plenty of time to talk to Mr. Passio of, again, the website whatonearthishappening.com.
[02:21:00.953 --> 02:21:03.676]  I always just type in Mark Passio and go listen to what he's saying and doing.
[02:21:03.776 --> 02:21:07.060]  And the reason I like it is that I've done a lot of historical research and he's really a smart guy.
[02:21:07.080 --> 02:21:07.821]  He knows what he's talking about.
[02:21:08.301 --> 02:21:12.406]  So many other people, which I'm not saying this with pleasure, don't know what they're talking about.
[02:21:13.167 --> 02:21:21.055]  And truth is so on its face when you know it, but then you run into other people that have never discovered it or never even experienced God's laws.
[02:21:22.193 --> 02:21:25.535]  Universal law that they are at war with it.
[02:21:25.555 --> 02:21:30.197]  They get angry that you possess it and there's like a spiritual envy.
[02:21:30.277 --> 02:21:43.244]  I would almost describe evil or Satanism or the demonic forces is they're upset by the very existence of the spirit of natural law that I guess almost like a prism comes down from God and almost beams out from us.
[02:21:43.284 --> 02:21:46.846]  I don't mean that to sound New Agey, but more and more I go to Democrat events.
[02:21:47.867 --> 02:21:51.589]  I've even gone there, you know, disguised with a cap on and whatever, and not let them know.
[02:21:51.829 --> 02:21:57.233]  And you hear these people, and they... Democrats didn't used to act like demonic goblins 20 years ago.
[02:21:57.673 --> 02:21:58.614]  Something's happening.
[02:21:58.674 --> 02:22:02.116]  People are either getting more demonic, more fallen, or more awake.
[02:22:03.236 --> 02:22:05.778]  How does that fit into what's happening on the planet, in your view?
[02:22:06.604 --> 02:22:16.087]  Well, I would say that there are spiritually fallen individuals that have really a very degraded sense of self and they're in a deep state of self-loathing.
[02:22:16.787 --> 02:22:22.128]  Only self-loathing people would want more control and violence in the world through government.
[02:22:22.448 --> 02:22:28.230]  You know, only self-loathing people become authoritarians and support authoritarianism.
[02:22:28.750 --> 02:22:28.950]  I think?
[02:22:49.151 --> 02:22:49.912]  We're good to go.
[02:23:18.999 --> 02:23:22.841]  Information in the universe that either destroys you or information that empowers you.
[02:23:23.582 --> 02:23:24.603]  That's exactly right.
[02:23:24.843 --> 02:23:32.768]  And you know what they're doing is they are confusing everybody about what the actual difference between right and wrong are.
[02:23:32.788 --> 02:23:44.075]  You know, they're trying to tell people that, you know, vices are crimes instead of actually really understanding the true wrongdoings that we should not be enacting or initiating toward our fellow beings.
[02:23:44.395 --> 02:23:44.675]  You know, the
[02:23:44.775 --> 02:23:54.959]  They focus on sins that almost everybody's involved in that aren't good, that aren't the fount of where it comes from, the breaking of the original laws from which all the other vice comes from.
[02:23:54.999 --> 02:24:04.582]  So, because I've always inherently said that, like not standing up against evil, or killing a baby, or being a coward, or lying to people to get ahead, that's a real sin.
[02:24:04.962 --> 02:24:12.525]  Smoking cigarettes, you know, having a, whatever, I mean, that's not good, but you always notice the churches they assess on that.
[02:24:12.765 --> 02:24:15.327]  They obsess on that because they don't want you to go address the big stuff.
[02:24:15.947 --> 02:24:18.669]  Yes, those are vices at best, not crimes.
[02:24:18.689 --> 02:24:28.295]  They're not actual transgressions against natural law because the transgressions against natural law are those things that initiate aggression and violence against others.
[02:24:28.475 --> 02:24:31.377]  So list some of the things, I mean the big ones, that really break God's law.
[02:24:31.397 --> 02:24:31.617]  Yes.
[02:24:32.138 --> 02:24:38.742]  The real seven deadly sins that are transgressions against all of natural law are murder, assault, rape,
[02:24:39.262 --> 02:24:43.184]  Theft, trespass, coercion, and willfully lying.
[02:24:43.204 --> 02:24:45.625]  And these are all forms of theft.
[02:24:45.725 --> 02:24:48.406]  If you really... Which willfully lying would be like a form of conspiracy.
[02:24:48.726 --> 02:24:50.786]  Cooking up new forms of inventing evil.
[02:24:51.507 --> 02:24:56.689]  Yeah, like, I mean, not telling someone there's a carcinogenic substance in something that you gave them to eat.
[02:24:56.869 --> 02:24:57.809]  You know, something like that.
[02:24:57.889 --> 02:25:08.153]  I mean, you're obviously, you know, holding back necessary information and knowledge that someone needs to know that if they don't... No, really, the withholding of knowledge, the attempt to keep people in the dark is a big sin.
[02:25:08.959 --> 02:25:10.500]  Yes, and that's what these people are.
[02:25:10.540 --> 02:25:11.541]  They are occultists.
[02:25:11.661 --> 02:25:14.503]  And what occult means is hidden knowledge.
[02:25:14.563 --> 02:25:22.468]  It means hiding knowledge that people need to understand, because if they don't understand it, it's going to open up a huge power differential through their ignorance.
[02:25:22.688 --> 02:25:24.790]  And that's what these dark occultists have done.
[02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:29.253]  They've wielded knowledge as a weapon over other people about how these laws of nature work.
[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:32.802]  And you just said it all.
[02:25:33.002 --> 02:25:38.150]  They are keeping us stunted like children so they can rule over a bunch of brain damaged children.
[02:25:38.590 --> 02:25:39.933]  That is the ultimate sin.
[02:25:40.837 --> 02:25:45.378]  I give an example like, imagine if someone didn't know how to do basic arithmetic.
[02:25:45.798 --> 02:25:49.319]  How much would a merchant be able to take advantage of them?
[02:25:49.659 --> 02:25:53.440]  You know, they would convert that ignorance into their advantage.
[02:25:53.460 --> 02:26:06.484]  And that's when Christ pulled out the whip and overturned the tables and beat the Pharisees, because they were making you pay ten times more for a certain coin to buy the sacrifice, and were engaged in a manipulation and ripping people off that were faithful.
[02:26:07.327 --> 02:26:08.888]  And it's all forms of theft.
[02:26:09.088 --> 02:26:12.071]  Every wrongdoing under natural law is a form of theft.
[02:26:12.111 --> 02:26:16.113]  If you break them all down, murder, the theft of life without just cause.
[02:26:16.734 --> 02:26:22.398]  Assault, taking someone else's well-being without, you know, the physical health of their body without right.
[02:26:22.878 --> 02:26:26.301]  Rape, the theft of someone's free will sexual association.
[02:26:26.801 --> 02:26:29.042]  Theft is the taking of property that's not yours.
[02:26:29.123 --> 02:26:34.366]  Trespass, the taking of security in another's dwelling place, which doesn't belong to you to take.
[02:26:34.646 --> 02:26:38.908]  Coercion is taking of someone's free will, the theft of free will, which isn't yours.
[02:26:39.288 --> 02:26:43.231]  And then lying is taking necessary knowledge from people, withholding necessary knowledge.
[02:26:43.611 --> 02:26:49.434]  You could boil natural law down in its most simplistic form to one overarching principle.
[02:26:49.775 --> 02:26:50.535]  Don't steal.
[02:26:50.835 --> 02:26:52.456]  Theft is the ultimate sin.
[02:26:52.496 --> 02:26:55.218]  It's the ultimate form of wrongdoing against natural law.
[02:26:55.458 --> 02:27:02.779]  And we even see plants and things that live in harmony versus things that come in and don't live in harmony and that are destructive.
[02:27:02.799 --> 02:27:04.840]  I mean, you see this as above, so below.
[02:27:05.980 --> 02:27:06.560]  Without a doubt.
[02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:20.043]  I mean, that's the principle of correspondence, that this is going on across all scales of creation and that as our behavior, as we put our behavior out into the universe, it is going to be reflected back to us as the shared human experience.
[02:27:20.063 --> 02:27:20.583]  You're a smart guy.
[02:27:20.743 --> 02:27:22.443]  Why do you think the globalists are so scared?
[02:27:22.803 --> 02:27:25.866]  Give me your honest opinion on Trump, on Infowars, on the censorship.
[02:27:26.166 --> 02:27:36.574]  They really dread, and I'm not trying to make ourselves the center of this, they fear, I get around senators and others, they shake in fear like we're a guillotine or something.
[02:27:36.875 --> 02:27:38.036]  Why do you think they're so scared?
[02:27:38.976 --> 02:27:44.942]  They fear any exposure of their criminal activity and of their complete deception.
[02:27:45.102 --> 02:27:53.891]  And anything that brings people closer into harmony with understanding truth, they want to shut down because the works of evil are always done in darkness.
[02:27:54.331 --> 02:27:57.114]  They can't deceive people if people are in full knowledge.
[02:27:57.534 --> 02:28:02.219]  They want to maintain their power differential by maintaining their knowledge differential.
[02:28:02.299 --> 02:28:03.300]  And as long as the main
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:06.881]  Do you agree with me that they're super scared right now?
[02:28:06.901 --> 02:28:07.661]  They seem really scared.
[02:28:31.841 --> 02:28:38.586]  I think that they are worried about the possibility of this type of knowledge breaking out and becoming more mainstream.
[02:28:39.046 --> 02:28:45.850]  I don't know if I would go so far as to say that they're shaking in their boots because they still have a lot of systems in place that are controlling the situation.
[02:28:45.870 --> 02:28:46.391]  Oh, no, I agree.
[02:28:46.471 --> 02:28:55.877]  Their systems are in place, but their big master plan, the more they try to birth it, the more there's rumblings and earthquakes, the more they have problems, but they still steam ahead.
[02:28:56.297 --> 02:28:56.918]  Stay right there.
[02:28:56.958 --> 02:28:59.880]  We'll get into some of the contemporary stuff with you and take some calls.
[02:28:59.900 --> 02:29:01.361]  We're going to get back more into this later, too.
[02:29:03.544 --> 02:29:14.469]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[02:29:14.969 --> 02:29:17.530]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:29:17.891 --> 02:29:20.852]  No one can doubt that InfoWars has changed the world.
[02:29:21.392 --> 02:29:31.057]  The globalists give us credit for discrediting their world government system, their neoliberal fascist plan, and infecting, in their words,
[02:29:31.997 --> 02:29:34.699]  The entire world was nationalism.
[02:29:34.979 --> 02:29:36.480]  Now, how did I do that?
[02:29:37.641 --> 02:29:38.741]  I did that because of you.
[02:29:39.342 --> 02:29:39.882]  We did that.
[02:29:40.382 --> 02:29:40.922]  You did that.
[02:29:40.943 --> 02:29:44.345]  We're either going to have freedom or we're going to have slavery.
[02:29:44.365 --> 02:29:47.807]  And these corporatists play nation states off against each other.
[02:29:48.367 --> 02:29:49.808]  They play men and women off against each other.
[02:29:49.828 --> 02:29:52.429]  They play people off against each other for what color their skin is.
[02:29:53.470 --> 02:29:56.652]  But the people of the world more and more are seeing through it.
[02:29:57.713 --> 02:29:59.574]  And that's why I want all of you right now
[02:30:00.754 --> 02:30:15.865]  As the world government falls apart, as the New World Order hits the panic button and tries to start a race war, to realize that we have come so far, and that all these globalists have now is trying to stir up internal information warfare fights.
[02:30:16.846 --> 02:30:27.794]  But we knew history, and knew that these globalists are arrogant, and there would come a time when their system would enter a crisis, when it actually tried to implement
[02:30:29.048 --> 02:30:32.353]  It's incredibly anti-human agenda.
[02:30:33.354 --> 02:30:36.338]  You know, I don't spend valuable time on air.
[02:30:37.603 --> 02:30:49.270]  Showing you the infrastructure here, showing you what goes into it, showing you how much money it costs to run this and do this, especially since we were deplatformed one year ago today.
[02:30:49.290 --> 02:30:55.775]  That's why we're calling it the one-year anniversary of the first domino to be unpersoned, to be sent into a black hole, the Phantom Zone.
[02:30:55.855 --> 02:30:57.796]  But the globalists did it too early.
[02:30:58.116 --> 02:31:05.281]  There's still talk radio, there's still TV, there's still independent websites like Infowars.com and Newswars.com that are on the air.
[02:31:06.421 --> 02:31:17.386]  And people have word of mouth to say, hey, just because you can't say Alex Jones' name on Facebook, unless it's a negative statement, or can't show Infowars.com, you can tell your office about Infowars.com.
[02:31:17.886 --> 02:31:19.807]  You can tell your neighbors about Newswars.com.
[02:31:20.427 --> 02:31:22.388]  You can share our videos and our articles.
[02:31:22.428 --> 02:31:23.128]  We have our own site.
[02:31:23.148 --> 02:31:23.888]  We have our own platform.
[02:31:25.089 --> 02:31:27.570]  That's the beauty of what's happening here.
[02:31:27.610 --> 02:31:30.791]  That's the beauty of what's unfolding.
[02:31:31.471 --> 02:31:32.552]  And it's a real fight.
[02:31:33.686 --> 02:31:39.051]  And things aren't going to go the way this whole synthetic technocracy want them to go, because you've been standing in the gap.
[02:31:39.832 --> 02:31:40.753]  You've been spreading the word.
[02:31:41.313 --> 02:31:41.974]  You've been praying.

[02:31:56.468 --> 02:31:57.309]  Double Patriot points.

[02:32:11.447 --> 02:32:14.291]  It is such a revolutionary act to keep this broadcast on air.
[02:32:14.491 --> 02:32:31.063]  It is such a revolutionary act, every time you put a bumper sticker on your car, or paintinfowars.com on the side of your barn, every time you stand up to leftist police, every time you tell the truth, every time you keep this symbol of free speech and pro-human values alive, the enemy comes one step closer to their system falling.
[02:32:31.223 --> 02:32:34.825]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[02:32:35.626 --> 02:32:39.709]  And now we've got a fighting chance, if we all take action, of defeating the globalists.
[02:32:40.109 --> 02:32:41.390]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:32:41.410 --> 02:32:43.031]  But please take advantage of the sale.
[02:33:06.175 --> 02:33:10.278]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.047 --> 02:33:23.889]  Alright, it's Mark Passio.
[02:33:25.762 --> 02:33:26.763]  With his great website.
[02:33:26.923 --> 02:33:34.267]  Coming to you live from the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[02:33:34.807 --> 02:33:36.588]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:37.408 --> 02:33:38.129]  Okay, Mark.
[02:33:39.109 --> 02:33:40.330]  Again, you can talk for 10 hours.
[02:33:40.370 --> 02:33:41.991]  You do great online conferences.
[02:33:42.271 --> 02:33:43.392]  I've watched lots of the DVDs.
[02:33:43.432 --> 02:33:43.912]  I've watched them.
[02:33:46.177 --> 02:33:49.619]  And I want to have you come to Austin sometime and do a whole presentation here, and I won't be here interrupting.
[02:33:49.639 --> 02:33:51.439]  It won't be radio and TV breaks interrupting.
[02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:53.580]  We've got a bunch of callers on a bunch of the subjects.
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:34:02.064]  You said you were happy to get into whatever and kind of apply your research and the way things are working to it, but I wanted to just bring this up real quick.
[02:34:02.644 --> 02:34:05.005]  The Bible says the wicked flee when none pursue.
[02:34:05.545 --> 02:34:11.608]  One of my favorite Bible verses, and they use that at the beginning of True Grit, the remake of it, that's excellent in my view.
[02:34:13.442 --> 02:34:16.983]  But there was a motorcycle backfire last night in New York.
[02:34:17.883 --> 02:34:19.923]  People totally panicked like it was the end of the world.
[02:34:20.724 --> 02:34:22.664]  And a gun hadn't even gone off.
[02:34:24.004 --> 02:34:25.324]  You pull up DrudgeReport.com.
[02:34:25.545 --> 02:34:33.246]  USA Today has evacuated because someone thought they might have seen someone with a gun.
[02:34:33.826 --> 02:34:39.948]  Now this shows the hysteria of still maybe a hundred people a year get killed in a mass shooting.
[02:34:41.008 --> 02:34:41.868]  Extremely rare.
[02:34:44.653 --> 02:34:47.274]  But still, it's this perception.
[02:34:50.255 --> 02:35:03.301]  So, fitting that into natural law, when people I've noticed are brought up in cities and haven't been out in the real world, or haven't done carpentry, or hunting, or done whatever, they don't have any smarts, even street smarts.
[02:35:04.081 --> 02:35:07.162]  And they seem to just take whatever mainstream news tells them.
[02:35:07.182 --> 02:35:10.524]  They're so soft, they're so domesticated, that
[02:35:12.148 --> 02:35:14.268]  If I were to backfire, I wouldn't even pay attention.
[02:35:15.089 --> 02:35:20.850]  But these people are so primed, there's mass shooters everywhere, that when they're out in public, they think they're about to die.
[02:35:20.890 --> 02:35:24.810]  Even though, statistically, taxis run over hundreds of people a year.
[02:35:25.170 --> 02:35:26.631]  I've almost been hit in New York by a taxi.
[02:35:26.931 --> 02:35:32.392]  But they don't have that common sense or natural law sense or differential.
[02:35:33.112 --> 02:35:37.312]  Whatever the system wants to project onto them, it's like they're almost a clean slate.
[02:35:37.372 --> 02:35:38.333]  Like they're soulless.
[02:35:38.913 --> 02:35:40.233]  And I don't want to say they're soulless.
[02:35:41.013 --> 02:35:44.038]  But it seems like they've already almost given over the ghost.
[02:35:44.159 --> 02:35:53.836]  How would you, in your system of studying natural law, which I think is a nice unifying field theory, how would you speak to that?
[02:35:54.847 --> 02:36:04.496]  Well, I would say it's absolutely true that they are domesticated and they do not understand the self-defense principle, which is one of the biggest aspects of natural law.
[02:36:04.956 --> 02:36:13.024]  You know, there's two unifying, overarching principles that one must understand if we're going to understand the totality of natural law.
[02:36:13.484 --> 02:36:16.167]  And that is, first, the non-aggression principle.
[02:36:17.047 --> 02:36:21.171]  The non-aggression principle just simply states that it is always immoral.
[02:36:21.291 --> 02:36:28.298]  It is morally wrong to initiate violence and aggression against other sentient beings.
[02:36:28.818 --> 02:36:34.063]  But we have to combine that non-aggression principle with the masculine aspect.
[02:36:34.503 --> 02:36:47.615]  Which is the self-defense principle and this means that we have the inherent right to defend our rights to defend ourselves and our property against people who are coming at us with violence and aggression.
[02:36:48.075 --> 02:36:49.657]  So self-defense.
[02:36:50.397 --> 02:37:05.358]  Is an inherent human right and what they've done is they have socially engineered the vast majority of people, especially people in urban environments to not understand, especially the self-defense principle.
[02:37:05.678 --> 02:37:14.005]  You know, we generally, as people, want to live in an environment that's not aggressive and violent, okay?
[02:37:14.365 --> 02:37:22.012]  But we think there's exceptions to that rule of the non-aggression principle for people in government, and that's a big morally relativistic problem.
[02:37:22.472 --> 02:37:39.388]  But the people in urban environments in particular, really most of them do not understand the self-defense principle, which is we always maintain the right, the inherent human right, to defend ourselves with weaponry against people who are initiating violence against us.
[02:37:39.708 --> 02:37:47.175]  And that's why the ownership of arms is absolutely so important and can never be given up if we're going to maintain our freedom.
[02:37:47.715 --> 02:37:53.459]  And shifting into the next subject, the left is everywhere going to Mitch McConnell's house, saying they're going to stab him to death.
[02:37:53.479 --> 02:38:01.565]  I mean, I don't want to kill anybody offensively, but let me tell you, if I went to Mitch McConnell's house or anybody's house and said, I'm going to stab a senator, I should get arrested.
[02:38:02.086 --> 02:38:05.028]  They're at his house at midnight with little kids yelling and cussing.
[02:38:05.268 --> 02:38:10.612]  They're breaking that natural law of you would never bring kids to a gunfight, never bring kids or something or cuss in front of them.
[02:38:11.453 --> 02:38:15.196]  They're about overriding every basic norm that we laid down of chivalry.
[02:38:15.836 --> 02:38:21.642]  Which I would say is a form of natural law being projected into man's law of, hey, let's not involve women and children in this.
[02:38:22.503 --> 02:38:25.065]  And then somebody's putting up flyers all over New York.
[02:38:25.085 --> 02:38:27.248]  DrudgeReport.com has the articles, InfoWars article.
[02:38:28.396 --> 02:38:30.297]  Saying we're going to put Republicans in death camps.
[02:38:30.377 --> 02:38:32.017]  Well, that's just somebody saying that.
[02:38:32.137 --> 02:38:37.939]  Well, everywhere the Democrats are saying, it's time to get violent, it's time to start killing, it's time to go after people.
[02:38:38.259 --> 02:38:46.281]  And then when some wound up white supremacist, if we even believe that, kills some poor Hispanic people, they then project it onto all Trump supporters.
[02:38:46.682 --> 02:38:49.662]  Again, it's like a death of logic, a death of common sense.
[02:38:50.003 --> 02:38:54.124]  They're the ones constantly saying, let's be dirty, let's not follow the rules, let's get violent.
[02:38:54.994 --> 02:39:02.876]  And then when somebody gets violent, they flip out and go, oh my gosh, you can't declare a war, and then when it starts, say, hey, you're not allowed to punch back.
[02:39:03.136 --> 02:39:08.297]  Which I'm not in any way defending whoever did that down there to those great people.
[02:39:08.337 --> 02:39:21.120]  It's evil, it's horrible, but even in the synthetic sea, they've created this idea where the left can attack, the left can censor the left-hand path, but no one else can stand against it.
[02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:22.381]  It's like a protected group.
[02:39:22.901 --> 02:39:24.101]  And they're at war with logic.
[02:39:25.009 --> 02:39:29.615]  If you study it historically, this is how all authoritarian regimes actually begin.
[02:39:29.675 --> 02:39:38.888]  There's always some sort of violent political group that is positioned as, you know, the favored people of the party that is taking over.
[02:39:38.908 --> 02:39:39.388]  The Brownshirts!
[02:39:40.149 --> 02:39:44.492]  Yeah, this was the brown shirts or the Sturmabteilung in Nazi Germany.
[02:39:45.152 --> 02:39:52.416]  And then they had the Night of the Long Knives in which those people were double-crossed and thrown under the bus and then the SS came to power.
[02:39:52.897 --> 02:39:56.819]  So, you know, it's always a matter of these authoritarianisms.
[02:39:57.179 --> 02:39:58.400]  I was about to say, there's always
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:28.805]  Whether it's fascism or communism, a useful idiot group that helps the evil guys come to power, and the globalists I've noticed, the satanists, always are very OCD.
[02:40:28.845 --> 02:40:30.006]  They follow exact plans.
[02:40:30.066 --> 02:40:31.387]  It's almost robotic.
[02:40:31.487 --> 02:40:32.348]  A. Do you agree with that?
[02:40:32.428 --> 02:40:35.469]  And B. Why do they throw their own minions under the bus?
[02:40:35.870 --> 02:40:38.011]  And then B. Why are they so robotic, or am I wrong?
[02:40:38.675 --> 02:40:53.243]  They are absolutely robotic and follow very stringent guidelines in their approaches, in their whole formula that they follow, because they are trapped in the reptilian mind, the reptilian or reactive part of the brain.
[02:40:53.804 --> 02:40:56.805]  And this part of the brain does not allow for creation.
[02:40:57.306 --> 02:41:04.870]  It is simply fight-or-flight mechanisms, and it sticks to the same plan as long as that plan continues to work, like repetition.
[02:41:05.510 --> 02:41:07.432]  And, you know, they don't really create.
[02:41:07.553 --> 02:41:10.636]  All they do is take things and twist them and distort them and invert them.
[02:41:11.177 --> 02:41:17.183]  And, you know, they absolutely follow a script because, unfortunately, it has always worked.
[02:41:17.584 --> 02:41:24.752]  They haven't had to deviate from their plan because the public is still in a very deep level of trance and ignorance.
[02:41:24.912 --> 02:41:25.152]  I agree.
[02:41:25.192 --> 02:41:28.075]  We'll come back and we'll take calls and talk about how we get out of that trance in your view.
[02:41:28.095 --> 02:41:29.776]  But I know Trump's not perfect.
[02:41:29.796 --> 02:41:30.937]  If you don't like Trump, that's fine.
[02:41:31.537 --> 02:41:32.578]  Give us your honest assessment.
[02:41:32.658 --> 02:41:34.460]  Why are they so enraged by Trump?
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:36.001]  Or are they not enraged by him?
[02:41:36.041 --> 02:41:36.862]  Is Trump a Trojan horse?
[02:41:37.577 --> 02:41:42.541]  No, they absolutely are, and I think it's because the last election represented archetypes.
[02:41:43.782 --> 02:41:51.808]  The mother authoritarian figure, you know, versus the father figure of the older man, you know, heterosexual man.
[02:41:52.109 --> 02:41:57.413]  And they know that they are trying to socially engineer a gender divide and start a gender war.
[02:41:57.793 --> 02:42:06.120]  And this last election represented the whole concept of the two archetypal principles, the feminine and masculine, pitted against each other.
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:08.381]  As if Hillary represents the feminine.
[02:42:08.681 --> 02:42:10.882]  As if, like you said, everything is twisted.
[02:42:10.902 --> 02:42:11.422]  That is not a woman.
[02:42:34.793 --> 02:42:41.095]  But to the leftists, obviously, you know, this is their archetypal mother figure that they got behind.
[02:42:41.115 --> 02:42:48.816]  So are you hinting that there's a deeper plan, not that Trump's bad or rigged, but there's a deeper plan to create the global revolution by bringing Trump in?
[02:42:48.836 --> 02:42:49.837]  Let me see what you say about that.
[02:42:50.057 --> 02:42:54.078]  And I promise, Carlos, Bill, Chase the Patriot, Rick, Brad, we're coming to your next segment.
[02:42:54.518 --> 02:42:59.059]  I haven't gotten to the FBI agent saying Trump's idling Hitler by lowering the flags.
[02:42:59.079 --> 02:42:59.879]  It's all coming up.
[02:43:03.860 --> 02:43:17.111]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on air 25 years and I've never, at a gut level, felt the fire of war like I do right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:18.171 --> 02:43:19.913]  So many incredible things are happening.
[02:43:20.553 --> 02:43:22.375]  So many dangerous things are unfolding.
[02:43:22.995 --> 02:43:26.238]  And at a cellular level, at a spiritual gut level,
[02:43:27.628 --> 02:43:45.542]  At the heart of my gut, the heart of my mind, at every level, I can just feel the evil rage of the globalists, knowing that their plan for world government, and their plan for total censorship, and their plan for human-animal clones, and sex with children, and Satanism is in trouble.
[02:43:45.662 --> 02:43:48.945]  It can feel the spirit of Christ coming back into the world.
[02:43:49.065 --> 02:43:50.126]  There's gonna be a tribulation.
[02:43:50.666 --> 02:43:53.989]  During this fight, but the devil knows he's going to lose.
[02:43:54.249 --> 02:43:57.712]  The devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows his time is short.
[02:43:57.832 --> 02:44:00.154]  And I can feel Satan's rage.
[02:44:00.294 --> 02:44:01.135]  I know you can feel it.
[02:44:01.215 --> 02:44:03.136]  And they are planning a bloody revolution here.
[02:44:03.317 --> 02:44:06.159]  They're planning massive censorship across the country and the world.
[02:44:06.239 --> 02:44:12.784]  This is a time to be praying to Christ for justice and for freedom and that God's spirit come into you and lead God and direct you.
[02:44:12.824 --> 02:44:15.827]  But it's also time to be politically and culturally active.
[02:44:15.987 --> 02:44:27.930]  And it's time to spread the word about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and override the AI sensors to override their systems and to let people know, hey, here's the name that must not be spoken.
[02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:29.430]  Here's what the world fears.
[02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:35.331]  Here's the guest and the information and the history and the analysis that is the cure to the globalist poison.
[02:44:35.451 --> 02:44:36.232]  InfoWars.
[02:44:36.552 --> 02:44:40.333]  Strength lies entirely with you and the action you take.
[02:44:40.553 --> 02:44:41.913]  You are the InfoWars.
[02:44:42.113 --> 02:44:48.555]  You are the resistance, and everything you do now will affect the battle space for billions of lives going to the future.
[02:44:49.235 --> 02:44:51.636]  The war has already begun, to quote Patrick Henry.
[02:44:52.156 --> 02:44:53.777]  It's an information and spiritual war.
[02:44:54.677 --> 02:44:57.378]  The enemy's losing that war, so they want to make it a physical war.
[02:44:57.938 --> 02:44:59.098]  So prepare yourselves.
[02:44:59.759 --> 02:45:00.499]  You have been warned.
[02:45:12.919 --> 02:45:14.540]  Joe in California, then Kevin.
[02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:15.200]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:45:15.241 --> 02:45:15.641]  Thanks for holding.
[02:45:15.781 --> 02:45:16.201]  Hey, Alex.
[02:45:16.341 --> 02:45:27.368]  I wanted to say to you that when history presents itself, that you are one of the most important people that this country's ever had, as far as getting the word out, making the truth of what's going on in our country.
[02:45:27.608 --> 02:45:32.991]  And I want to thank you for that, because 15 years ago, when I started listening to you, I had no idea what was going on.
[02:45:33.271 --> 02:45:37.554]  And now people, when I talk to people, they think I'm crazy, and I just tell them, here's the fact.
[02:45:37.714 --> 02:45:38.935]  And I'm educating people.
[02:45:39.035 --> 02:45:42.497]  My family thought I was crazy for a long time, but now they're really educated.
[02:45:42.597 --> 02:45:43.037]  We're good to go.
[02:45:43.057 --> 02:45:43.578]  We're good to go.
[02:45:43.598 --> 02:45:44.178]  We're good to go.
[02:45:44.198 --> 02:45:44.679]  We're good to go.
[02:45:44.719 --> 02:45:45.339]  We're good to go.
[02:45:45.359 --> 02:45:45.980]  We're good to go.
[02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:46.660]  We're good to go.
[02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:47.521]  We're good to go.
[02:45:47.541 --> 02:45:48.081]  We're good to go.
[02:45:48.101 --> 02:45:48.822]  We're good to go.
[02:45:48.842 --> 02:45:49.642]  We're good to go.
[02:45:49.682 --> 02:45:50.183]  We're good to go.
[02:45:50.203 --> 02:45:50.763]  We're good to go.
[02:45:50.803 --> 02:45:51.904]  We're good to go.
[02:45:51.924 --> 02:45:52.384]  We're good to go.
[02:45:52.424 --> 02:45:52.985]  We're good to go.
[02:45:53.005 --> 02:45:53.485]  We're good to go.
[02:45:53.525 --> 02:45:54.025]  We're good to go.
[02:45:54.045 --> 02:45:54.526]  We're good to go.
[02:45:54.546 --> 02:45:55.026]  We're good to go.
[02:45:55.086 --> 02:45:55.566]  We're good to go.
[02:45:55.586 --> 02:45:56.407]  We're good to go.
[02:45:56.427 --> 02:45:57.048]  We're good to go.
[02:45:57.088 --> 02:45:57.968]  We're good to go.
[02:45:58.008 --> 02:45:58.729]  We're good to go.
[02:45:58.749 --> 02:45:59.689]  We're good to go.
[02:45:59.709 --> 02:46:00.330]  We're good to go.
[02:46:00.350 --> 02:46:01.010]  We're good to go.
[02:46:01.090 --> 02:46:01.611]  We're good to go.
[02:46:01.631 --> 02:46:02.231]  We're good to go.
[02:46:02.251 --> 02:46:02.752]  We're good to go.
[02:46:02.772 --> 02:46:03.212]  We're good to go.
[02:46:03.232 --> 02:46:03.692]  We're good to go.
[02:46:03.712 --> 02:46:04.073]  We're good to go.
[02:46:04.113 --> 02:46:04.593]  We're good to go.
[02:46:04.613 --> 02:46:05.374]  We're good to go.
[02:46:05.394 --> 02:46:05.834]  We're good to go.
[02:46:05.854 --> 02:46:05.994]  We're
[02:46:07.535 --> 02:46:10.138]  It's super male, the bone broth, the colloidal silver.
[02:46:10.378 --> 02:46:13.322]  I give my kids colloidal silver if they got a cold within a day or so.
[02:46:13.362 --> 02:46:14.683]  They don't have that cold anymore.
[02:46:14.763 --> 02:46:18.788]  My blood pressure has went from high to low, and the doctors keep asking me what I'm taking.
[02:46:18.828 --> 02:46:21.551]  So I want to commend you on making the best product out there.
[02:46:21.671 --> 02:46:24.715]  And I went through a lot of products, and I don't think anything's better than yours.
[02:46:24.855 --> 02:46:27.377]  Well, I appreciate your support, and again, I'll just tell people the truth.
[02:46:27.577 --> 02:46:29.358]  I know supplements work if they're high quality.
[02:46:29.919 --> 02:46:31.260]  I'm the worst at not taking.
[02:46:31.961 --> 02:46:36.104]  And so I go through cycles where I take them, and then I lose all this weight and get healthy, and then I stop taking them.
[02:46:36.384 --> 02:46:39.226]  And I'm like, how do I get myself to take my own supplements?
[02:46:39.386 --> 02:46:43.229]  And then as soon as I go back on supplements, like I did two weeks ago, things start getting better again.
[02:46:43.249 --> 02:46:46.632]  So yes, these are the very best supplements out there, and they fund the Second American Revolution.
[02:46:46.732 --> 02:46:48.473]  So thank you so much, Joe, for those kind words.
[02:46:48.593 --> 02:46:50.215]  That's what funds the InfoWar.
[02:46:50.295 --> 02:46:52.536]  At InfoWarStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:47:05.689 --> 02:47:08.550]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:08.790 --> 02:47:14.992]  Rising up, straight to the top.
[02:47:15.052 --> 02:47:16.333]  Left the guts, got the glory.
[02:47:16.393 --> 02:47:20.074]  Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop.
[02:47:20.134 --> 02:47:24.276]  Just a man, acting his real
[02:47:40.692 --> 02:47:45.155]  So, Figla Uzi spews more lies out of his mouth than an Uzi.
[02:47:46.516 --> 02:47:52.741]  I didn't even cover him the last few days, just with outrageous statements about Trump wanting a race war and Trump's Hitler.
[02:47:53.662 --> 02:47:55.083]  But now he's gone even further.
[02:47:55.963 --> 02:47:58.225]  I just keep wondering how the lies are going to escalate.
[02:47:58.245 --> 02:48:00.547]  Because used to, people got in trouble.
[02:48:00.767 --> 02:48:07.292]  You know, saying the world's going to end in 12 years like AOC or... AOC, you know, stealing $2 million out of the campaign money.
[02:48:07.632 --> 02:48:08.773]  Maybe she will get in trouble, but...
[02:48:09.807 --> 02:48:30.307]  And another bizarre performance, this is on Infowars.com, on NBC News Programming, former FBI assistant director, assistant director for counterterrorism, Frank Figliuzzi, claimed that President Trump may have ordered flags down at half-staff, not to honor the victims of the Dayton or El Paso shootings, but rather to collaborate and celebrate Hitler.
[02:48:30.367 --> 02:48:33.611]  Now, this is a very obscure thing.
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:41.838]  That I barely knew about, but some prison folks and like some kind of prison gang think about 88 as in the alphabet, Heil Hitler.
[02:48:42.827 --> 02:48:51.090]  But it's this bigger attack on language and words that Ingsoc and George Orwell, Eric Blair wrote about because he was actually a top propagandist for them.
[02:48:51.130 --> 02:48:53.151]  Winston Smith is an allegory of him.
[02:48:53.211 --> 02:48:55.592]  He wrote essays admitting this.
[02:48:55.652 --> 02:49:03.736]  He said they want to destroy language and create emotional responses to it and then reduce the language after you've made the language toxic.
[02:49:04.236 --> 02:49:06.317]  And so that's part of this process of just removing language.
[02:49:07.117 --> 02:49:08.618]  And well, I mean, here's the clip.
[02:49:08.978 --> 02:49:12.560]  Now, now remember, all these famous football players have had 88.
[02:49:14.221 --> 02:49:22.887]  But I personally am not a huge football guy, but I owned a Drew Pearson, because Drew Pearson is a great guy, is a great family guy, has a great record.
[02:49:22.907 --> 02:49:25.308]  That's the kind of football player I like to, you know, emulate.
[02:49:25.768 --> 02:49:27.670]  I mean, years ago, I had an 88 jersey.
[02:49:28.170 --> 02:49:31.112]  And I was just teasing Drew that works in the office, who's Hispanic.
[02:49:32.102 --> 02:49:36.528]  Last week, because he was wearing a Drew Pearson, obviously, Drew, Drew Pearson.
[02:49:37.029 --> 02:49:38.510]  And I said, oh look, you're a Nazi.
[02:49:38.530 --> 02:49:40.273]  So we come and I said, well the left now says 88.
[02:49:42.472 --> 02:49:43.073]  Is Hitler.
[02:49:43.713 --> 02:49:44.814]  And he went, oh, I never heard that.
[02:49:44.854 --> 02:49:48.937]  And then now in the news, it's this week, they're externalizing the method.
[02:49:48.957 --> 02:49:55.801]  They're popularizing the demonization of letters and numbers and mother and father and the OK symbol.
[02:49:56.041 --> 02:49:57.302]  This is part of a larger plan.
[02:49:58.143 --> 02:50:00.284]  So no, Drew Pearson's not a Nazi, neither is Trump.
[02:50:00.504 --> 02:50:03.967]  And this is even more esoteric or even more ridiculous or even more made up.
[02:50:05.808 --> 02:50:08.910]  They're saying because he ordered him down on one day and to go back up on 8-8,
[02:50:15.034 --> 02:50:17.556]  We have to understand the adversary and the threat we're dealing with.
[02:50:18.336 --> 02:50:21.998]  And if we don't understand how they think, we'll never understand how to counter them.
[02:50:22.358 --> 02:50:25.320]  So it's the little things and language and messaging that matters.
[02:50:25.660 --> 02:50:29.442]  The President said that we will fly our flags at half-mast.
[02:50:30.282 --> 02:50:31.983]  Until August 8th.
[02:50:32.383 --> 02:50:33.103]  That's 8-8.
[02:50:34.663 --> 02:50:42.926]  Now, I'm not going to imply that he did this deliberately, but I am using it as an example of the ignorance of the adversary that's being demonstrated by the White House.
[02:50:42.946 --> 02:50:47.987]  The numbers 8-8 are very significant in neo-Nazi and white supremacy movement.
[02:50:48.147 --> 02:50:48.227]  Why?
[02:50:50.208 --> 02:50:53.390]  The letter H is the 8th letter of the alphabet.
[02:50:53.450 --> 02:50:57.893]  And to them, the numbers 8-8 together stand for Heil Hitler.
[02:50:58.313 --> 02:51:03.476]  So we're going to be raising the flag back up at dusk on 8-8.
[02:51:04.397 --> 02:51:05.837]  We also understand the adversaries.
[02:51:07.517 --> 02:51:09.278]  His daughter is married to an Orthodox Jew.
[02:51:09.318 --> 02:51:11.400]  That's why he moved the embassy back to Jerusalem.
[02:51:11.901 --> 02:51:22.289]  This is the biggest load of BS, but it's this FBI agent that is invoking this, and that is now making the symbol that.
[02:51:22.849 --> 02:51:24.931]  They're taking over every symbol, Mark Passio.
[02:51:24.951 --> 02:51:25.792]  What do you think's behind it?
[02:51:26.755 --> 02:51:35.985]  Well, I think symbology is very important to understand and what he's referring to there is gematria or some type of occult or hidden symbolism.
[02:51:36.045 --> 02:51:36.205]  Exactly.
[02:51:36.245 --> 02:51:38.347]  You speak extensively how they communicate with this.
[02:51:38.988 --> 02:51:41.891]  Yeah, but it doesn't mean we're into it, but they're communicating with it.
[02:51:42.763 --> 02:51:44.524]  You can't take a pattern.
[02:51:44.564 --> 02:51:49.566]  Patterns are very important to recognize, but you can't apply them to instances where they don't actually apply.
[02:51:49.606 --> 02:51:54.248]  You have to apply them where they really do apply, and I think that is a tremendous stretch.
[02:51:54.408 --> 02:51:57.030]  It's sort of ridiculous what he's trying to apply it to there.
[02:51:57.470 --> 02:51:59.951]  Well, it'd be one thing if Trump was actually a Nazi.
[02:52:00.651 --> 02:52:01.892]  Maybe then, but I mean...
[02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:06.562]  That's the normal times to take a flag down for, what, four to seven days.
[02:52:07.062 --> 02:52:08.683]  So, I mean, I don't know what to say anymore.
[02:52:09.864 --> 02:52:16.847]  As you know, anybody that doesn't agree with the narrative coming out of the authoritarian left is going to be applied a Nazi.
[02:52:16.887 --> 02:52:23.631]  This is a communist technique straight out of Stalin's playbook to attack anyone that, you know, opposed communism.
[02:52:23.651 --> 02:52:28.013]  That was my next point, because they're saying, the leader of Italy, they're saying we're nationalists as a Nazi.
[02:52:28.434 --> 02:52:30.855]  Why are they using a Stalinist or Maoist handbook?
[02:52:32.347 --> 02:52:33.928]  Because to this point it has worked.
[02:52:34.208 --> 02:52:36.129]  You know, the people haven't wised up to it.
[02:52:36.189 --> 02:52:38.951]  They haven't really studied what socialism is.
[02:52:38.991 --> 02:52:46.255]  They don't understand that it's control of resources in the hands of the state and distribution of them as they will see fit.
[02:52:46.275 --> 02:52:47.756]  And that's how they can control people.
[02:52:48.437 --> 02:52:53.299]  They haven't historically studied communism and what it has produced societally.
[02:52:53.500 --> 02:52:55.961]  So like Dodo Birds, we don't know that we haven't been through it.
[02:52:56.361 --> 02:52:57.382]  Let me ask you this then.
[02:52:59.019 --> 02:53:00.180]  Because I forgot the question for the break.
[02:53:01.341 --> 02:53:02.783]  You're real gut level on Trump.
[02:53:02.803 --> 02:53:04.204]  I mean, I think he means well.
[02:53:04.244 --> 02:53:05.065]  He's done a lot of good.
[02:53:05.085 --> 02:53:06.967]  And we see nationalism spreading.
[02:53:06.987 --> 02:53:11.091]  But at the same time, I do see the division that they've used him to create.
[02:53:11.111 --> 02:53:15.055]  It's not his fault that I agree that there's some larger alchemy going on here.
[02:53:15.916 --> 02:53:18.479]  I think they studied it actuarially.
[02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:20.401]  Actuarial studies.
[02:53:20.441 --> 02:53:21.262]  Like an insurance.
[02:53:21.969 --> 02:53:25.172]  Yeah, like insurance companies, high-level financial companies.
[02:53:25.513 --> 02:53:35.302]  They run a lot of complex variables through supercomputers, and obviously intelligence agencies do this all the time, to predict human behavior through trends, through current trends.
[02:53:35.923 --> 02:53:44.612]  And, you know, I think they saw the type of political polarization that would occur if they allowed Trump to take the presidency, and that's why I think he was actually put in there.
[02:53:45.392 --> 02:53:48.374]  I don't necessarily believe that he's evil himself.
[02:53:48.554 --> 02:53:50.415]  I just think that he's not enlightened.
[02:53:50.555 --> 02:53:55.838]  He has to really wake up to a higher level of true enlightenment and spirituality.
[02:53:55.878 --> 02:54:01.681]  If he did, I think maybe he'd be a motivational force for good if he really understood natural law at a deep level.
[02:54:02.141 --> 02:54:04.762]  So, you know, that's sort of my personal take on that.
[02:54:04.782 --> 02:54:05.623]  I try to stay faithful.
[02:54:05.643 --> 02:54:06.203]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:54:06.323 --> 02:54:07.764]  What did they think running Hillary?
[02:54:08.684 --> 02:54:10.205]  I know they ran it through supercomputers.
[02:54:10.225 --> 02:54:12.406]  They really thought she was going to win at least one faction.
[02:54:12.806 --> 02:54:17.908]  But I agree, there's another faction that definitely wants U.S.
[02:54:17.988 --> 02:54:19.388]  power to come up on top.
[02:54:19.488 --> 02:54:25.371]  Not even so much for the people, but it sees us as... Basically, it's like Sauron.
[02:54:25.391 --> 02:54:28.412]  It hands out the rings of power, but it's got the one held back.
[02:54:29.418 --> 02:54:39.726]  They ran Clinton because they knew she would be the totalitarian sprint, you know, but some factions prefer the totalitarian tiptoe, as David Icke likes to call it.
[02:54:40.047 --> 02:54:52.697]  It's getting from, you know, a state of, you know, alleged freedom to a state of total lockdown in society very slowly, so that it's like the frog in the boiling pot, you know, allegory.
[02:54:52.997 --> 02:54:56.560]  That if they do it slowly over a period of time, people won't recognize it.
[02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:15.909]  And I think what they saw with the whole Clinton vs. Trump thing in the last election is it would create such overwhelming polarization in society that when the pendulum swings back the other way in a future election, they're going to be able to take it in the direction that they want in a much faster speed.
[02:55:15.949 --> 02:55:24.933]  Let's go further down that route because I think that's, I'm not saying that's the current reality, but that's possibly what's been going on at least at some levels in a possible future being looked at.
[02:55:26.141 --> 02:55:32.065]  Hillary was advised by some of the nastiest satanists and globalists out there who I know don't associate with Trump and don't like him.
[02:55:32.706 --> 02:55:34.207]  But there are people up even above them.
[02:55:34.567 --> 02:55:43.053]  She kept saying to the network she controlled, only give Trump attention and ignore everyone else because she thought he was the easiest to beat.
[02:55:43.113 --> 02:55:48.717]  Now she was being advised by people that knew damn well he had more charisma on his pinky than she had in her whole body.
[02:55:49.417 --> 02:55:52.679]  And so and then once she finally figured it out by the
[02:55:54.016 --> 02:56:00.301]  inauguration or by the nomination in July of 2016, it was too late.
[02:56:00.822 --> 02:56:08.748]  But yes, there was, you call it the Hand of Providence or maybe the Black Hand of the New World Order, but definitely there was a hand moving there.
[02:56:09.975 --> 02:56:10.455]  I agree.
[02:56:10.475 --> 02:56:19.118]  I think they position this like a chess strategist would position themselves several moves ahead.
[02:56:19.138 --> 02:56:27.460]  And I think again, you know, I'll reiterate that I think it was really done to create this social divide and social polarization that we're seeing.
[02:56:27.540 --> 02:56:36.623]  Political social polarization is at an all-time high, almost to the point of it feels like a pressure cooker out there in society, especially in urban environments.
[02:56:37.143 --> 02:56:41.106]  And I think they saw that that was a very real possibility that they could create.
[02:56:41.566 --> 02:56:45.970]  And that's how these strategists, these social engineers, play their long-term game.
[02:56:47.050 --> 02:56:48.071]  It's an amazing time.
[02:56:48.291 --> 02:56:49.872]  If you can do 15 more minutes, we'll take some calls.
[02:56:49.892 --> 02:56:50.973]  You gotta go, you gotta go.
[02:56:51.594 --> 02:56:53.595]  Whatsonearthishappening.com.
[02:56:53.655 --> 02:56:54.336]  Mark Passio.
[02:56:54.436 --> 02:56:55.557]  I promise now.
[02:56:56.317 --> 02:56:56.858]  Two-minute break.
[02:56:57.398 --> 02:57:00.800]  We're gonna go to Carlos, Bill, Chase the Patriot, Rick, Brad, and then...
[02:57:02.216 --> 02:57:05.458]  He's taken over, always informative, one of the most popular guests we have.
[02:57:05.478 --> 02:57:06.998]  We've even done national studies.
[02:57:07.038 --> 02:57:07.959]  I didn't used to do surveys.
[02:57:08.019 --> 02:57:10.960]  We've paid for big scientific ones, real ones, not the fake ones.
[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:15.162]  And we know that my show's most popular, close second, Paul Watson and Mike Adams.
[02:57:15.542 --> 02:57:17.163]  Everybody loves the rest of the crew, obviously.
[02:57:17.663 --> 02:57:20.605]  David Knight, unsurprisingly, has the highest IQ audience.
[02:57:21.365 --> 02:57:23.167]  They're almost all engineers and scientists.
[02:57:23.627 --> 02:57:25.128]  And he has the most government people listening.
[02:57:25.148 --> 02:57:26.910]  He's on weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[02:57:26.990 --> 02:57:29.052]  Owen Schroer is just popular across the board.
[02:57:29.432 --> 02:57:30.873]  He's coming up, 3 o'clock.
[02:57:30.933 --> 02:57:33.275]  But, you know, it's kind of what we already thought was going to be going on.
[02:57:33.856 --> 02:57:37.399]  I have the most minorities listening, which, welcome, folks from all over the world.
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:39.781]  But we're here with Mark Passio, Smart Cookie.
[02:57:40.101 --> 02:57:43.765]  Fourth hour, straight ahead with, I got it, First Year Calls.
[02:57:43.785 --> 02:57:48.048]  And a couple of special videos we've got that haven't aired yet, we're going to premiere.
[02:57:48.088 --> 02:57:48.469]  Stay with us.
[02:57:53.594 --> 02:57:57.118]  Alex, I got a plug for the Patriot Points.
[02:57:57.438 --> 02:58:01.382]  I got $180 so far this year, the Patriot Points, and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[02:58:02.023 --> 02:58:05.086]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[02:58:05.146 --> 02:58:09.511]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in, so I'd rather give that money to
[02:58:09.631 --> 02:58:10.672]  Let me break this down for you.
[02:58:10.732 --> 02:58:12.293]  I've never really done marketing, but I did
[02:58:30.629 --> 02:58:34.972]  Bring in a few advertising people a few years ago who knew how to advertise online.
[02:58:34.992 --> 02:58:37.513]  And they said, Mr. Jones, they said, what's your markup?
[02:58:37.633 --> 02:58:38.454]  And I said, 150%.
[02:58:39.134 --> 02:58:40.095]  But we always discount 25%.
[02:58:40.395 --> 02:58:41.315]  So that's 100%.
[02:58:41.355 --> 02:58:42.736]  And they said, yeah.
[02:58:42.856 --> 02:58:44.077]  And then you're always discounting 20, 30%.
[02:58:44.197 --> 02:58:46.919]  And then we notice you only sell stuff when it's at 50%.
[02:58:47.739 --> 02:58:49.200]  And then you're barely making any money.
[02:58:49.360 --> 02:58:50.541]  You need to stop that.
[02:58:50.622 --> 02:58:53.644]  And they looked at our data and they said, oh, your audience would buy it if it was even more.
[02:58:53.664 --> 02:58:55.406]  And I said, I want high quality stuff in there.
[02:58:55.846 --> 02:58:56.647]  I want a good price.
[02:58:57.167 --> 02:59:02.832]  But I've kind of habituated everybody, trained everybody, myself done this, to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[02:59:03.012 --> 02:59:05.134]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off.
[02:59:05.154 --> 02:59:08.157]  Because there's no fillers, it's concentrated, it's got iodine, a little silver.
[02:59:08.317 --> 02:59:11.820]  And so it's the same thing with like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[02:59:11.920 --> 02:59:18.406]  I mean, DNA Force, I signed a multi-year contract on that, so I was able to cut the price about 40% of what we were paying.
[02:59:18.546 --> 02:59:21.429]  It's still got 30-something dollars of product in it.
[02:59:21.509 --> 02:59:26.374]  I mean, you talk about cleaning your cells out, you talk about energy stamina, you talk about letting the telomeres last longer.
[02:59:26.494 --> 02:59:31.279]  This is patented to do that, and nobody puts this much of the real organic stuff in it.
[02:59:31.459 --> 02:59:33.201]  Oh yes, DNA Force is amazing.
[02:59:33.341 --> 02:59:34.282]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[02:59:34.302 --> 02:59:38.387]  But listen, when people get the Patriot Points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[02:59:38.507 --> 02:59:47.017]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, and then we're getting 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot Points, we lose money.
[02:59:47.037 --> 02:59:47.618]  But that's okay.
[02:59:47.678 --> 02:59:48.298]  Thanks for the support.
[02:59:56.505 --> 03:00:03.609]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:05.710 --> 03:00:16.876]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[03:00:17.356 --> 03:00:18.697]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:20.978 --> 03:00:21.939]  Well, I can tell you this.
[03:00:23.556 --> 03:00:25.937]  A lot of people can say, hey, we think Trump got installed.
[03:00:25.957 --> 03:00:27.798]  There was massive election fraud against him.
[03:00:27.858 --> 03:00:31.180]  I don't think it's bad to ask that question, because there's always different factions and groups.
[03:00:31.820 --> 03:00:34.181]  But I can tell you, nobody's telling me what to say.
[03:00:35.282 --> 03:00:39.924]  And I've talked to Trump many times, and I've gotten information to Trump, and I've seen him act on it.
[03:00:40.464 --> 03:00:42.945]  And that's why they're pissed, is he's really trying to be the president.
[03:00:43.846 --> 03:00:50.069]  Now, I agree there are people that thought, okay, let him get in, it'll create such a civil war that we'll get our Hegelian dialectic out of this.
[03:00:51.556 --> 03:00:56.981]  I've experienced Trump, after I talk to him, go and say word for word the next day.
[03:00:57.961 --> 03:01:01.724]  I've experienced getting reports from him from law firms and you name it and seeing him take action.
[03:01:05.290 --> 03:01:19.621]  I think Trump overall is for real, but I think it's legitimate to ask the question, how is the power structure going to try to use the climate he is creating, or they're trying to create with him, against him, for their greater agenda?
[03:01:20.102 --> 03:01:28.268]  But I have, Mark, I have witnessed Trump literally be the president, actually be in command, actually do real things.
[03:01:29.109 --> 03:01:33.332]  But at the same time, sometimes I see him, the last person he talks to is kind of what he goes with.
[03:01:34.451 --> 03:01:39.733]  Yeah, I'm watching his behavior cautiously regarding the whole censorship issue.
[03:01:39.873 --> 03:01:41.913]  I think that's going to be very telling.
[03:01:42.433 --> 03:01:51.356]  And I think, like, I'm definitely not happy regarding some of the things he said regarding gun control and none regarding gun control.
[03:01:51.576 --> 03:01:55.858]  So, you know, I will watch it cautiously, optimistically at best.
[03:01:56.318 --> 03:01:56.678]  I agree.
[03:01:57.378 --> 03:02:00.219]  OK, let's go ahead and talk to
[03:02:02.500 --> 03:02:04.043]  What you just mentioned, Rick in Indiana.
[03:02:04.464 --> 03:02:06.829]  Rick is concerned about red flag laws in Trump.
[03:02:06.870 --> 03:02:07.310]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:02:07.972 --> 03:02:10.056]  Yes, it's a great honor to speak with you, Alex.
[03:02:10.417 --> 03:02:13.424]  Again, I am calling about the red flag gun control laws.
[03:02:14.013 --> 03:02:19.755]  And I would say to our great president, who's done so much for the American people, be careful what you ask for, President Trump.
[03:02:20.116 --> 03:02:23.417]  The difficulty with these laws is who decides what is mental illness.
[03:02:23.917 --> 03:02:27.018]  It's kind of like who decides what is hate speech on the big tech platform.
[03:02:27.038 --> 03:02:27.639]  It's the Democrats.
[03:02:27.659 --> 03:02:28.219]  They're going to decide.
[03:02:28.239 --> 03:02:28.719]  Sure, yeah!
[03:02:29.099 --> 03:02:36.642]  Yeah, and it's possible that if enacted and enforced with equal justice, the red flag laws President Trump has called for, for all U.S.
[03:02:36.662 --> 03:02:42.425]  citizens... Yeah, if you're a devil worshipper saying, I want to murder people in hundreds of places, then yeah, yeah.
[03:02:42.845 --> 03:02:48.851]  Yeah, but they could be used to unconstitutionally end President Donald J. Trump's own Second Amendment rights.
[03:02:48.911 --> 03:02:49.872]  Now let me explain that.
[03:02:50.252 --> 03:02:50.672]  No, you're right.
[03:02:50.712 --> 03:02:52.314]  They've already been saying 22nd Amendment.
[03:02:52.754 --> 03:02:54.416]  Yeah, the 25th Amendment hoax.
[03:02:54.496 --> 03:02:55.156]  This big hoax.
[03:02:55.196 --> 03:02:57.178]  They said he's mentally ill.
[03:02:57.619 --> 03:02:59.240]  Okay, now let's look at this.
[03:02:59.340 --> 03:03:02.143]  Look at the red flags against Trump and the warning signs.
[03:03:02.583 --> 03:03:13.290]  There were 70,765 mental health professionals who signed a petition titled, Mental Health Professionals Declared Trump is Mentally Ill and Must Be Removed.
[03:03:13.730 --> 03:03:14.571]  April 21st, 2017.
[03:03:14.731 --> 03:03:16.212]  Oh my God, there's your headlines.
[03:03:16.392 --> 03:03:19.654]  Would red flag laws remove Trump under the 25th Amendment?
[03:03:19.694 --> 03:03:20.354]  Right, right!
[03:03:20.654 --> 03:03:24.797]  April 21st, 2017, UK independent newspaper headline reads,
[03:03:25.157 --> 03:03:30.581]  Donald Trump has dangerous mental illness, say psychiatry experts at the Yale conference.
[03:03:30.901 --> 03:03:33.183]  Now, listen to what some of these folks said.
[03:03:33.423 --> 03:03:34.624]  Now, don't get me wrong.
[03:03:35.310 --> 03:03:52.282]  Trump's a great president, and I don't believe any of this, but these highly decorated, distinguished, degreed medical experts came out and they said the president was paranoid and delusional, and it was their ethical responsibility to warn the American public about the dangers.
[03:03:52.623 --> 03:03:54.704]  Now, let's get real.
[03:03:54.844 --> 03:04:04.231]  I mean, when the average guy goes into court, OK, it's not going to take 70,000 mental health professionals if you have one.
[03:04:04.798 --> 03:04:09.922]  That says that you're mentally ill, even if it's totally untrue for any other citizen.
[03:04:09.942 --> 03:04:12.203]  Sure, he called it accelerated.
[03:04:12.284 --> 03:04:14.105]  He called it accelerated due process.
[03:04:14.125 --> 03:04:14.965]  There's no such thing.
[03:04:15.246 --> 03:04:15.726]  So it's true.
[03:04:15.766 --> 03:04:20.309]  They're saying red flag law, the president under the 25th Amendment, remove him from office.
[03:04:20.650 --> 03:04:22.011]  And now here he is saying, oh.
[03:04:22.631 --> 03:04:25.012]  Look, we already have the Baker Act and other things.
[03:04:25.032 --> 03:04:26.312]  This guy's saying, I'm a devil worshipper.
[03:04:26.352 --> 03:04:27.093]  I want to go to hell.
[03:04:27.413 --> 03:04:29.033]  I'm going to kill a fascist.
[03:04:29.073 --> 03:04:29.834]  He's an antifa.
[03:04:30.194 --> 03:04:31.874]  He's saying, I'm in a terrorist organization.
[03:04:31.914 --> 03:04:32.775]  I'm going to kill people.
[03:04:33.195 --> 03:04:34.736]  He certainly could have been examined.
[03:04:34.776 --> 03:04:35.216]  But no.
[03:04:35.596 --> 03:04:36.356]  Now he does this.
[03:04:36.376 --> 03:04:37.877]  Now all of us lose our due process.
[03:04:38.177 --> 03:04:38.597]  And you're right.
[03:04:38.617 --> 03:04:43.579]  The Democrats are saying they want to red flag law the presidency with the 25th Amendment.
[03:04:43.799 --> 03:04:44.319]  Great points.
[03:04:44.339 --> 03:04:44.719]  Thank you.
[03:04:44.979 --> 03:04:46.540]  Mark Passio, you want to comment on that caller?
[03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:47.641]  Absolutely.
[03:04:47.681 --> 03:04:55.231]  I mean, this is why I am such a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and just in general, the self-defense principle under natural law.
[03:04:55.571 --> 03:04:59.997]  The Second Amendment says that our right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:05:00.057 --> 03:05:01.619]  It's very unambiguous.
[03:05:01.659 --> 03:05:02.661]  Shall not be infringed.
[03:05:04.580 --> 03:05:08.304]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[03:06:05.430 --> 03:06:18.796]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[03:06:19.696 --> 03:06:23.538]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistant
[03:06:28.335 --> 03:06:33.817]  So many great minds like that last caller.
[03:06:33.837 --> 03:06:38.819]  The whole psychiatric system is leftist run, 90% of it.
[03:06:39.719 --> 03:06:41.500]  The old Soviet Union used that to oppress people.
[03:06:41.520 --> 03:06:44.441]  So here's Trump saying, oh yeah, we need to get people
[03:06:45.851 --> 03:06:48.233]  You know, under these red flag laws, they get rid of due process.
[03:06:48.574 --> 03:06:55.480]  When these guys are running around openly saying what they're gonna do on Facebook, Twitter, they're gonna kill people with guns and nobody's stopping them.
[03:06:55.741 --> 03:06:57.522]  The existing laws deal with that.
[03:06:57.582 --> 03:07:01.146]  Almost all these shooters have been in the psychiatric system and on these drugs.
[03:07:01.166 --> 03:07:04.149]  So you want to put a bookend on what you were just talking about?
[03:07:04.833 --> 03:07:22.342]  Yeah, I've done two pretty extensive presentations called The True Meaning and Purpose of the Second Amendment, in which I break down the Second Amendment extensively and explain how the right to keep and bear arms is an essential property of natural law principles, namely the self-defense principle.
[03:07:22.822 --> 03:07:25.324]  And that's why it says shall not be infringed.
[03:07:25.424 --> 03:07:37.593]  It's very unambiguous and clear that that is an absolute and any gun control laws are not only unconstitutional according to you know the Constitution itself if you even accept
[03:07:37.933 --> 03:07:42.556]  You know, constitutionalism as the supreme law of the land, but it's against natural law.
[03:07:42.676 --> 03:07:54.084]  It is against our own inherent right that we have under God's laws to protect ourselves, namely from a rogue government that has gone criminal and is trying to take our rights away.
[03:07:54.144 --> 03:07:58.046]  That's why the right of self-defense should never be infringed in any way.
[03:07:58.266 --> 03:08:00.127]  And that's exactly how you talk to Trump.
[03:08:00.448 --> 03:08:03.069]  We'll put an article out, we'll put this video out, I guarantee you it'll get to him.
[03:08:05.026 --> 03:08:08.887]  Because Trump knows he's not supposed to look at him for it, so he looks at it daily, I'm told.
[03:08:10.507 --> 03:08:20.289]  Hey, Mr. President, the 25th Amendment is a red flag law on you, so remember due process and watch out the Pandora's boxes you open here.
[03:08:20.589 --> 03:08:30.090]  Mark Passio is our guest, really well-spoken historical speaker, smart guy on natural law, not the survival of the fittest social Darwinism, but the real natural law, God's law.
[03:08:30.711 --> 03:08:32.631]  Let's go ahead and go to Carlos in Canada.
[03:08:33.131 --> 03:08:36.013]  Well, if you will allow me for a second because your guest brought up an important point.
[03:08:36.033 --> 03:08:37.294]  This FBI agent that made this association
[03:08:59.272 --> 03:09:10.701]  I want to debunk it right off the bat because it is really evil for people like that who are really conspirators, okay, real conspirators, to do this information on otherwise uninformed people.
[03:09:11.122 --> 03:09:17.667]  You could have said very easily, if you look at the clock right now in Japan, it's the 8th, Thursday the 8th.
[03:09:18.368 --> 03:09:21.070]  The 8th in the United States will be the 9th.
[03:09:21.971 --> 03:09:27.295]  On the 7th, on the 6th, sorry, yesterday at 8.15 in the morning US time,
[03:09:29.229 --> 03:09:37.435]  100,000 people were afflicted at 8.15 in the morning by a nuclear blast.
[03:09:37.455 --> 03:09:40.918]  100,000 out of 350,000 lost their life.
[03:09:40.978 --> 03:09:44.021]  Approximately 80,000 lost it in the first 11 seconds.
[03:09:44.841 --> 03:09:50.366]  Subsequent to that, the rest were increased to almost half of the population.
[03:09:50.386 --> 03:09:52.447]  All right, Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[03:09:52.707 --> 03:09:55.650]  So he could have spun it that Trump did it to commemorate bombing Japanese?
[03:09:56.485 --> 03:09:57.065]  Precisely.
[03:09:57.446 --> 03:10:03.429]  And if the flags have half-mast, even if it wasn't intended to be so, why don't we look at the positive side of things?
[03:10:03.929 --> 03:10:04.389]  Exactly.
[03:10:04.409 --> 03:10:06.931]  He lowered them for the Japanese, but exactly.
[03:10:06.971 --> 03:10:10.253]  It's like they just distort everything instead of just straight messaging.
[03:10:11.173 --> 03:10:11.473]  That's right.
[03:10:11.714 --> 03:10:13.194]  Also, segue to that.
[03:10:14.255 --> 03:10:16.536]  Pakistan and India are nuclear powers.
[03:10:17.997 --> 03:10:21.579]  Right now, Pakistan is in no position to fight a war with India.
[03:10:22.340 --> 03:10:23.040]  India is
[03:10:23.703 --> 03:10:24.184]  I think?
[03:10:48.470 --> 03:11:04.100]  This will affect all future development in the area, especially if India is part of the BRICS and is part of... Well, I mean, you sound like you're uninformed on this, but under that agreement, Indians, even that have been refugees, can't move back if they're not basically Muslims.
[03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:04.921]  That's outrageous.
[03:11:05.721 --> 03:11:06.121]  That's right.
[03:11:06.161 --> 03:11:07.622]  So it will be stabilizing.
[03:11:08.143 --> 03:11:11.445]  It'll be a head-to-head, nose-to-nose confrontation.
[03:11:11.765 --> 03:11:13.026]  But these are nuclear powers.
[03:11:13.066 --> 03:11:15.207]  They're grown-up societies.
[03:11:15.467 --> 03:11:16.248]  They're not foolish.
[03:11:16.852 --> 03:11:27.197]  And I think, you know, again, to these conspirators, be careful, because we're here trying to assess the truth, not to engage in fanciful thinking.
[03:11:27.637 --> 03:11:36.882]  And in this case, we pray that, you know, wiser people, guided people, not guided missiles, will be the ruling class in this area of the world.
[03:11:37.222 --> 03:11:38.583]  Because I think if we don't,
[03:11:39.065 --> 03:11:40.886]  We will be making very foolish mistakes.
[03:11:41.146 --> 03:11:44.067]  I talk to your listeners like I would talk to my family, you know?
[03:11:44.587 --> 03:11:47.668]  And I mean, with all respect, okay, information is power.
[03:11:47.728 --> 03:11:51.369]  And InfoWars is information challenging ignorance.
[03:11:51.710 --> 03:11:52.590]  That's the way I see it.
[03:11:53.610 --> 03:11:55.671]  Well, you're always a great caller, Carlos, a smart guy.
[03:11:56.631 --> 03:12:00.493]  Most experts agree this is the place World War III or World War IV, if you call it that, could start.
[03:12:00.913 --> 03:12:03.174]  Marc Passio, what do you think about the situation in Kashmir?
[03:12:03.594 --> 03:12:04.174]  It's a big deal.
[03:12:05.091 --> 03:12:11.853]  I think that all of the globalists right now want to create as much geopolitical instability as possible.
[03:12:11.913 --> 03:12:14.754]  That's part of their long-term plan of divide and conquer.
[03:12:15.375 --> 03:12:23.057]  So, you know, it's not so much to analyze the very particulars of every single situation... No, I agree.
[03:12:23.097 --> 03:12:24.618]  It's all part of a larger proxy war.
[03:12:24.898 --> 03:12:35.803]  Their long-term thinking is what we really have to understand is that they want to create chaos out of which they can come in and then impose their predetermined solution of that chaos.
[03:12:36.203 --> 03:12:41.025]  That's why they want geopolitical stability in all different regions of the world.
[03:12:41.505 --> 03:12:49.032]  But again, the people have to, like McCuller said very, very well, that this is about knowledge versus ignorance.
[03:12:49.572 --> 03:12:52.675]  And an ignorant people can never be a free people.
[03:12:52.935 --> 03:12:54.617]  Thomas Jefferson basically said that.
[03:12:54.977 --> 03:13:04.285]  That, you know, if people expect to be ignorant and free simultaneously in a state of civilization, they expect what never has been and what never will be.
[03:13:04.306 --> 03:13:05.166]  That's right.
[03:13:05.366 --> 03:13:06.187]  So, Carlos, Bill...
[03:13:08.268 --> 03:13:08.888]  You're right, smart.
[03:13:09.408 --> 03:13:11.189]  Bill, Bill in Las Vegas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:13:11.209 --> 03:13:16.811]  Hey Alex, the last time you had Lord Monckton on, he said something that kind of struck a chord with me.
[03:13:17.331 --> 03:13:22.573]  He said that this hell was starting to bloom on its own because of the increase in carbon in the atmosphere.
[03:13:23.514 --> 03:13:31.237]  And if you go back, watch Quantum of Solace, the second Daniel Craig James Bond film again, it was all about control of water.
[03:13:32.297 --> 03:13:37.519]  And it was control of water by a world-renowned developer of green technology, Dominic Green.
[03:13:38.593 --> 03:13:48.121]  If you put that together with the last 10 or so minutes of the big short, what was the guy who made the most money off the housing crisis going to invest in next?
[03:13:48.502 --> 03:13:48.782]  Water.
[03:13:50.874 --> 03:13:55.276]  Well, it's true that if carbon dioxide even goes up a little bit, plants need half as much water on average.
[03:13:55.856 --> 03:13:57.357]  And so yields massively explode.
[03:13:57.377 --> 03:13:58.237]  So they're really pissed.
[03:13:58.257 --> 03:14:05.860]  That's why Soros and all of them are doing this thing to try to reduce water with the now declassified massive geoengineering project.
[03:14:06.080 --> 03:14:07.741]  Hey, what do you make of that, Mark Pacio?
[03:14:08.401 --> 03:14:11.202]  How they're just admitting now that, oh yeah, we are spraying the atmosphere.
[03:14:12.851 --> 03:14:37.165]  I've been following the geoengineering agenda for over 20 years now, and they are absolutely trying to affect not only the atmosphere, but the soil, which these chemicals that they're spraying from these tanker planes come down to the earth, go into the soil, alkalize it, because they're largely comprised of metals from the alkaline earth metal group on the periodic table.
[03:14:37.205 --> 03:14:39.607]  Don't worry, Monsanto's got seeds that'll still grow in that.
[03:14:40.447 --> 03:14:40.948]  Oh, sure.
[03:14:41.428 --> 03:14:50.492]  You know, so they want to affect the nutrient quality and content of our food, and that will weaken people by weakening their minds.
[03:14:50.512 --> 03:14:50.732]  Absolutely.
[03:14:50.752 --> 03:14:51.433]  We're almost out of time.
[03:14:51.453 --> 03:14:52.393]  I've got to have Mark back.
[03:14:52.413 --> 03:14:52.894]  Thank you, Bill.
[03:14:53.254 --> 03:14:54.474]  Brad in Texas.
[03:14:54.514 --> 03:14:54.995]  Real fast.
[03:14:55.015 --> 03:14:55.495]  Go ahead, Brad.
[03:14:55.515 --> 03:14:57.356]  Hey, Alex.
[03:14:57.976 --> 03:15:07.821]  I wanted to say real quick, I really agree with what your guest is saying, because as a matter of fact, I'm an Orthodox Jew, and I do Kabbalah classes every night.
[03:15:08.246 --> 03:15:11.127]  And we discussed everything that you and the guests are talking about.
[03:15:11.147 --> 03:15:13.948]  So, I mean, you guys sounded just like my rabbi.
[03:15:15.508 --> 03:15:22.650]  Kabbalah is one of the traditions that I've studied for a number of years, and I break it down on my show, What on Earth is Happening, quite often.
[03:15:22.690 --> 03:15:29.252]  I actually just went through a series where I compared Kabbalah and Kabbalistic teachings to the teachings of the Tarot.
[03:15:29.672 --> 03:15:36.614]  So, I get into spiritual teachings like that, and if it's used properly and properly understood, it's a powerful force for understanding natural law.
[03:15:38.030 --> 03:15:41.251]  I mean, common sense is universal.
[03:15:41.551 --> 03:15:44.433]  The difference is the priest class and the different people who are trying to control it.
[03:15:44.473 --> 03:15:45.133]  I'm out of time, Brad.
[03:15:45.153 --> 03:15:45.493]  I'm out of time.
[03:15:45.733 --> 03:15:46.213]  Chase the Patriot.
[03:15:46.233 --> 03:15:46.613]  I apologize.
[03:15:46.633 --> 03:15:47.474]  I'll try to get to everybody.
[03:15:48.314 --> 03:15:50.715]  Mark Passio, WhatOnEarthIsHappening.com.
[03:15:51.015 --> 03:15:51.776]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:15:51.816 --> 03:15:52.636]  Really interesting interview.
[03:15:52.656 --> 03:15:54.397]  Look forward to having you back again soon.
[03:15:55.337 --> 03:15:56.257]  Alex, thank you so much.
[03:15:56.898 --> 03:15:57.238]  All right.
[03:15:57.618 --> 03:15:59.719]  He's coming up next, and he's ready.
[03:16:03.650 --> 03:16:09.704]  The Democrats are making it no secret that they're trying to take away our freedom and they're trying to take away our flag.
[03:16:15.914 --> 03:16:17.775]  But we can't let them get away with it.
[03:16:18.335 --> 03:16:26.978]  That's why you need to go to Infowarestore.com right now and get yourself a limited edition Betsy Ross flag t-shirt, which is on sale for $17.76.

[03:16:51.250 --> 03:16:53.892]  God bless America, and God bless InfoWars.
[03:16:56.834 --> 03:16:58.256]  Flawless victory.
[03:17:02.839 --> 03:17:03.520]  This is important.
[03:17:04.901 --> 03:17:05.341]  I'm 45 years old.
[03:17:07.196 --> 03:17:10.177]  When I was 35, I swam to 2 miles a day sometimes.
[03:17:10.798 --> 03:17:11.698]  And would jog.
[03:17:12.398 --> 03:17:13.219]  And couldn't lose weight.
[03:17:14.079 --> 03:17:16.640]  Because I didn't have the missing links.
[03:17:16.840 --> 03:17:21.422]  I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[03:17:22.083 --> 03:17:27.265]  I knew all about the private Federal Reserve, the Trilateral Commission, the New World Order, Jeffrey Epstein, the pedophile rings.
[03:17:27.585 --> 03:17:32.507]  I knew all about geopolitical systems, and the old Soviet Union, and how the globals put the Chai Kams in.
[03:17:32.727 --> 03:17:34.448]  But I didn't know about PQQ.
[03:17:35.148 --> 03:17:36.009]  I didn't know about CoQ10.
[03:17:37.611 --> 03:17:41.454]  I didn't know about all this, and I didn't know about Clean Iodine.
[03:17:42.535 --> 03:17:44.096]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation.
[03:17:45.217 --> 03:17:53.463]  I want you to get products that have changed my life, and changed so many other people's lives, that have 98% reviews, and that experience that I'm not BSing you.
[03:17:54.263 --> 03:18:00.348]  So that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated.
[03:18:00.368 --> 03:18:01.869]  Let me tell you something right now.
[03:18:03.210 --> 03:18:03.991]  You see DNA Force?
[03:18:05.106 --> 03:18:18.393]  I went out to top manufacturers that are the most respected, most highly tested, and I said, I want the strongest PQQ CoQ10 overall formula that has pure, non-synthetic stuff in it that's ever been put on the market.
[03:18:19.353 --> 03:18:21.855]  And they said, well, that's like a $22 each model.
[03:18:22.355 --> 03:18:24.016]  I said, I want to put $50 a bottle on it.
[03:18:25.056 --> 03:18:26.097]  They said, nobody's ever done that.
[03:18:26.764 --> 03:18:29.446]  Then I signed a contract to double the amount I was going to buy.
[03:18:29.706 --> 03:18:32.968]  I got it down to $37 a bottle for what it cost me to make this.
[03:18:33.669 --> 03:18:34.669]  Nobody does that!
[03:18:35.550 --> 03:18:41.834]  Ladies and gentlemen, you read what's in this and you research every ingredient in this and then you experience it for yourself.
[03:18:42.694 --> 03:18:43.395]  It's incredible.
[03:18:45.313 --> 03:18:56.118]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[03:18:56.698 --> 03:18:59.139]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:19:03.058 --> 03:19:14.060]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[03:19:14.120 --> 03:19:22.722]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[03:19:22.982 --> 03:19:27.003]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[03:19:27.683 --> 03:19:34.032]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[03:19:34.152 --> 03:19:36.235]  And you may be experiencing backup too.
[03:19:36.335 --> 03:19:42.203]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to InfoWarsStore.com and get OxyPowder.
[03:19:42.263 --> 03:19:44.826]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.
[03:19:45.507 --> 03:19:55.391]  If you're experiencing some cloggage, some backup of your own, Oxy-Powder from InfowarsStore.com will clear it out, guaranteed.
[03:19:55.891 --> 03:20:02.334]  So go to InfowarsStore.com, take care of your clogged plumbing with Oxy-Powder.
[03:20:06.056 --> 03:20:08.697]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.815 --> 03:20:25.377]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:25.517 --> 03:20:29.279]  The poets tell how Poncho fell.
[03:20:30.519 --> 03:20:32.180]  Alright, I covered a lot of the news.
[03:20:33.080 --> 03:20:35.441]  I didn't get to a bunch of it.
[03:20:35.481 --> 03:20:38.422]  I think I'm just going to stay here today and probably go to this war room with Owen Schroeder.
[03:20:38.822 --> 03:20:40.423]  That's in 40 minutes from now.
[03:20:40.623 --> 03:20:42.984]  Mike Adams always does a great job as a guest or a co-host.
[03:20:43.024 --> 03:20:44.945]  He's taking over here in just a moment.
[03:20:46.308 --> 03:20:47.449]  I didn't even plug last hour.
[03:20:47.489 --> 03:20:48.890]  I get so busy and so focused.
[03:20:48.930 --> 03:20:52.313]  And if I don't plug, we don't get funding and we go bye-bye on the Globalist win.
[03:20:52.713 --> 03:20:56.256]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50-60% off.
[03:20:56.416 --> 03:20:58.198]  The biggest sale we've done since last Christmas.
[03:21:00.051 --> 03:21:04.695]  It's last week's big sale, extended banniversary, when we got banned.
[03:21:04.975 --> 03:21:05.956]  These are great products.
[03:21:05.976 --> 03:21:10.940]  Thank you all for your support, whether it's Ultra 12, whether it's Real Red Pill Plus, whether it's the high-quality swearable foods.
[03:21:11.501 --> 03:21:13.282]  It's all there at mfullworksstore.com.
[03:21:13.382 --> 03:21:14.483]  Thank you for your support.
[03:21:14.883 --> 03:21:16.825]  Thank you for those out there that have made this possible.
[03:21:17.265 --> 03:21:17.926]  Mike's taking over.
[03:21:17.946 --> 03:21:19.207]  I wanted to play this piece, though.
[03:21:19.667 --> 03:21:22.289]  Robert Barnes was on national television, our lawyer.
[03:21:23.346 --> 03:21:26.628]  And he did file suit against the Covington folks that did that.
[03:21:27.048 --> 03:21:29.590]  He told me privately this other suit's going to be dismissed.
[03:21:29.950 --> 03:21:31.811]  I'm not going to tell you what he told me, but he was dead on.
[03:21:32.312 --> 03:21:34.553]  Let's just say there's a lot of stuff going on.
[03:21:34.933 --> 03:21:36.174]  But his real suits have been filed.
[03:21:36.194 --> 03:21:38.055]  We've got our suits getting filed very soon.
[03:21:38.516 --> 03:21:40.457]  We're about a month behind, but that was a month ago.
[03:21:40.537 --> 03:21:41.878]  It's next week or the week after.
[03:21:41.898 --> 03:21:44.480]  And we're not litigious, but it's got to be done.
[03:21:44.640 --> 03:21:46.621]  And that's why our fight is your fight.
[03:21:46.641 --> 03:21:49.323]  We need financial support because we're swinging for the fences here.
[03:21:50.060 --> 03:21:52.343]  I don't know how it's going to end, but if they want to fight, they're going to get one.
[03:21:52.764 --> 03:21:53.445]  But here he was.
[03:21:53.465 --> 03:21:56.349]  So I saw this piece he put out on Twitter a few hours ago.
[03:21:56.389 --> 03:22:02.158]  I said, why don't we add video for folks so they can see what he's talking about being true?
[03:22:02.479 --> 03:22:05.443]  So we've just augmented him live on this television program.
[03:22:05.463 --> 03:22:05.804]  Here it is.
[03:22:06.855 --> 03:22:10.561]  When we say Google manipulation, I mean, what exactly does that mean?
[03:22:10.601 --> 03:22:15.769]  Tulsi says that Google didn't run her ads after the first debate at a time when she was trending.
[03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:17.972]  Google said that was a mistake, as we mentioned.
[03:22:17.992 --> 03:22:22.118]  But give us the ways that Google can, in fact, manipulate the elections.
[03:22:23.777 --> 03:22:26.879]  So what happens is Google basically manipulates which stories show up.
[03:22:27.139 --> 03:22:29.861]  So I'll give you a real live time example of how that's happening right now.
[03:22:30.262 --> 03:22:40.269]  People at home could go and search, say, Alex Jones, a prominent Infowars.com media broadcaster, big on the political right and with swing political constituencies.
[03:22:40.709 --> 03:22:46.133]  If you go to DuckDuckGo, or you go to Bing, and you search Alex Jones, you'll find InfoWars in a mix of articles.
[03:22:46.553 --> 03:22:50.356]  If you go to Google, you won't even find his main broadcasting station, InfoWars.
[03:22:50.436 --> 03:22:52.617]  Instead, you'll just find a bunch of negative hit pieces.
[03:22:53.078 --> 03:22:55.079]  So this is just the little way they can do so.
[03:22:55.459 --> 03:23:00.683]  Alex Jones influences maybe three to four percent of the vote, but that can be enough to swing the elections in the upper Midwest.
[03:23:00.983 --> 03:23:09.669]  They could do the same thing as to other people who are amplifying Donald Trump, whether a conservative message or a Tulsi Gabbard and her anti-war, anti-establishment message.
[03:23:10.029 --> 03:23:19.941]  They can do it to anybody, anywhere, anyplace, anytime, because right now there have been no legal remedies for this true election meddling between big tech and big media when they collude together.
[03:23:21.042 --> 03:23:22.363]  That is powerful.
[03:23:22.844 --> 03:23:24.886]  We're going to put that up on Infowars.com.
[03:23:24.906 --> 03:23:26.909]  Sorry Mike, I said I was throwing it to you and then I took over.
[03:23:27.189 --> 03:23:28.651]  Go ahead my friend, that's pretty powerful info.
[03:23:29.813 --> 03:23:30.494]  No, I was just saying that.
[03:23:30.514 --> 03:23:39.684]  That was attorney Robert Barnes, Infowars attorney, really explaining exactly how Google can control the outcomes of elections with selective mental focus.
[03:23:40.104 --> 03:23:46.251]  I didn't mean to take it from you there, Alex, but, you know, selective mental focus is how Google will try to steal the next election.
[03:23:48.027 --> 03:23:53.989]  And so what they're going to do is they're going to encourage Democrats to go out and vote, but not conservatives.
[03:23:54.310 --> 03:23:56.130]  So anyway, I've got a lot lined up here.
[03:23:56.410 --> 03:23:59.332]  Alex, should I just jump right into it?
[03:23:59.352 --> 03:23:59.572]  Yes, sir.
[03:23:59.592 --> 03:24:00.372]  You take over, my friend.
[03:24:01.926 --> 03:24:02.487]  Okay, all right.
[03:24:02.507 --> 03:24:03.408]  It's great to join you.
[03:24:03.628 --> 03:24:08.954]  Welcome, InfoWarriors, to the Mike Adams segment of the 4th Hour here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:08.994 --> 03:24:11.917]  I really appreciate all your support and your support of InfoWars Store.
[03:24:12.357 --> 03:24:15.000]  And also know that I always come prepared.
[03:24:15.761 --> 03:24:19.085]  When I do this show, which is roughly about once a week or so,
[03:24:19.725 --> 03:24:22.787]  I always come prepared because I want you to understand what's coming.
[03:24:22.807 --> 03:24:28.932]  I do a lot of deep analysis and looking at trends and looking at the playbook of what globalists are doing.
[03:24:29.092 --> 03:24:33.996]  And today I'm going to give you, I think, a lot of practical information about what you can do to prepare for what's coming.
[03:24:34.536 --> 03:24:37.878]  But first, the analysis of where this is going.
[03:24:38.399 --> 03:24:39.720]  Now, red flag laws.
[03:24:40.333 --> 03:24:41.674]  Let me talk about that for a second.
[03:24:42.194 --> 03:24:52.803]  Trump is at least voicing some support for red flag laws, but that might just be, you know, saying he's supporting it now, but he won't really sign a bill on that.
[03:24:53.223 --> 03:25:01.369]  Nevertheless, the idea of a red flag law is so incredibly dangerous to our republic for this very reason.
[03:25:02.330 --> 03:25:07.314]  Once it is passed, either at a state level or a federal level, if it is passed,
[03:25:08.311 --> 03:25:19.137]  Leftists will claim that anybody who wants to own a gun is mentally unstable and therefore anybody who wants to own a gun should not be allowed to own a gun because of red flag laws.
[03:25:19.617 --> 03:25:21.018]  So you see this is a catch-22.
[03:25:21.798 --> 03:25:29.342]  If you want to own a gun you're obviously mentally unstable and should not be allowed to own a gun and the only people that should be allowed to own guns are people who don't want to own guns.
[03:25:30.062 --> 03:25:33.544]  This will be the talking point of the delusional left.
[03:25:34.185 --> 03:25:34.885]  But I say
[03:25:35.916 --> 03:25:39.678]  We the people should have red flag laws for journo-terrorists.
[03:25:40.658 --> 03:25:51.942]  Why can't we remove from power, through some red flag means, a journalist or so-called journalist that goes out there and lies and says that all Trump supporters are white supremacists?
[03:25:52.683 --> 03:25:54.183]  Or that all white people are bad?
[03:25:54.763 --> 03:25:56.104]  Or that all gun owners are bad?
[03:25:57.104 --> 03:26:01.526]  Those people are abusing their positions of power in a dangerous way.
[03:26:02.282 --> 03:26:13.566]  And if they're saying that gun owners should have their guns taken away, shouldn't journo terrorists who are pushing hatred and pushing violence and celebrating Antifa, shouldn't they lose their platform?
[03:26:13.766 --> 03:26:19.268]  I mean, really, if we're going to have red flag laws here, let's go after those who are the most dangerous in society.
[03:26:19.648 --> 03:26:25.550]  And that's not law-abiding gun owners who are just, they just want self-defense against violence.
[03:26:25.570 --> 03:26:26.470]  They want to stop violence.
[03:26:27.156 --> 03:26:29.037]  But journo-terrorists, i.e.
[03:26:29.057 --> 03:26:33.358]  these radical left-wing journalists, they want to promote violence.
[03:26:33.998 --> 03:26:39.960]  So if we're going to have red flag laws, let's go after those who are actually a danger to this society.
[03:26:40.780 --> 03:26:45.222]  And also, Trump says he might support expanded background checks.
[03:26:45.782 --> 03:26:47.242]  Okay, that's great.
[03:26:47.342 --> 03:26:49.743]  Let's have background checks for all members of Congress.
[03:26:50.383 --> 03:26:52.624]  Let's have background checks and drug tests
[03:26:53.283 --> 03:27:00.474]  And let's look into the backgrounds of people in Congress who have met with Communists, who are influenced by Communist China.
[03:27:01.135 --> 03:27:05.562]  Let's look at the backgrounds of these people and how they've been radicalized to hate this country.
[03:27:06.246 --> 03:27:14.372]  Let's look at the background of Ilhan Omar, because there's a fascinating background of marriage fraud and immigration fraud and campaign finance fraud.
[03:27:14.912 --> 03:27:16.554]  Let's look at the background of AOC and others.
[03:27:17.094 --> 03:27:18.055]  You want background checks?
[03:27:18.495 --> 03:27:19.976]  Alright, let's make it universal.
[03:27:20.577 --> 03:27:21.437]  Starting with Congress.
[03:27:21.537 --> 03:27:22.038]  How about that?
[03:27:22.538 --> 03:27:23.499]  Drug test those people.
[03:27:23.859 --> 03:27:24.920]  And by the way, while we're at it...
[03:27:25.894 --> 03:27:33.939]  Let's have a red flag law that says if you have Alzheimer's or dementia and you're senile and you're on Alzheimer's drugs, you don't get to serve in Congress anymore.
[03:27:33.979 --> 03:27:34.499]  How about that?
[03:27:34.919 --> 03:27:35.760]  Nancy Pelosi?
[03:27:35.940 --> 03:27:36.320]  Gone.
[03:27:36.640 --> 03:27:37.621]  Dianne Feinstein?
[03:27:38.061 --> 03:27:38.441]  Gone.
[03:27:38.761 --> 03:27:45.965]  If you've lost the capacity to function in a normal cognitive way, why should you be deciding laws for our country?
[03:27:46.446 --> 03:27:50.708]  And how about red flag laws for states that are allowing illegals to vote?
[03:27:51.420 --> 03:27:59.544]  Let's have a red flag law that says if your state, i.e., California, allows illegals to vote in elections, then your Electoral College votes don't count.
[03:28:00.265 --> 03:28:00.665]  That's right.
[03:28:01.025 --> 03:28:10.610]  Eliminate California from the Electoral College until they have voter ID laws so that only legal American citizens can vote in their elections.
[03:28:11.290 --> 03:28:19.695]  We should also nullify California senators and members of Congress because they were elected by illegals voting with the advocacy of the state of California.
[03:28:20.771 --> 03:28:23.613]  Now, of course, I'm kidding about a little bit of that.
[03:28:23.633 --> 03:28:24.594]  That's never going to happen.
[03:28:25.034 --> 03:28:26.455]  But that's the argument here.
[03:28:26.895 --> 03:28:28.096]  You want to have red flag laws?
[03:28:28.636 --> 03:28:29.857]  You want to have background checks?
[03:28:30.217 --> 03:28:30.558]  Okay.
[03:28:31.338 --> 03:28:32.399]  Let's background check
[03:28:33.118 --> 03:28:35.198]  Democrats and their corruption.
[03:28:35.499 --> 03:28:40.920]  Let's have red flag laws against the journo terrorists and the corrupt criminals in the deep state.
[03:28:41.520 --> 03:28:43.040]  Let's make it really universal.
[03:28:43.460 --> 03:28:45.641]  Don't just target conservatives and Trump supporters.
[03:28:46.061 --> 03:28:50.902]  Let's have laws and background checks that affect all these people who are trying to destroy America.
[03:28:51.642 --> 03:28:54.423]  Much more straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:54.443 --> 03:28:55.223]  This is Mike Adams.
[03:28:55.343 --> 03:28:55.883]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:05.267 --> 03:29:07.068]  Let's go to James in Massachusetts.
[03:29:07.448 --> 03:29:08.129]  James, you're on the air.
[03:29:08.149 --> 03:29:08.689]  Thanks for calling.
[03:29:10.230 --> 03:29:11.011]  Hello, Alex.
[03:29:11.631 --> 03:29:13.493]  God bless General Jones.
[03:29:13.553 --> 03:29:15.734]  May you live in peace and love forever.
[03:29:15.774 --> 03:29:16.835]  In Christ's name, we pray.
[03:29:16.955 --> 03:29:17.695]  God bless you, brother.
[03:29:17.916 --> 03:29:19.196]  And I'd like to thank you also.
[03:29:19.217 --> 03:29:22.519]  You know, my wife and I have been married for 17 years and we were never able to have kids.
[03:29:22.639 --> 03:29:31.765]  And after a couple of years of taking the B12 and the iodine and knowing about not using fluoride and not having vaccines, we have a great, healthy, vibrant, six-year-old boy.
[03:29:31.885 --> 03:29:33.126]  And I thank you very much for that.
[03:29:33.226 --> 03:29:35.907]  Well, you know, fluoride is meant to block fertility.
[03:29:36.367 --> 03:29:39.348]  It's the bad halogen, but iodine is associated with fertility.
[03:29:39.808 --> 03:29:40.909]  So that's a beautiful story.
[03:29:40.949 --> 03:29:41.949]  That's exciting, my friend.
[03:29:42.089 --> 03:29:46.310]  And I've got all the articles right here about IQ, fertility, being boosted on iodine.
[03:29:46.871 --> 03:29:47.331]  You name it.
[03:29:47.591 --> 03:29:51.632]  That's why the system fights to keep people from getting good iodine and other things that we talk about here.
[03:29:51.692 --> 03:29:53.933]  Even though I get it from InfoWarsTore.com, it doesn't matter to me.
[03:29:53.993 --> 03:29:56.274]  Just research what deficiencies are doing.
[03:29:56.434 --> 03:29:59.575]  But get back to you and your wife and recap the story you were telling.
[03:29:59.775 --> 03:30:23.307]  So we've been married for 17 years and we never had any children and we bought the water filter first and we cut out the fluoride and the glyphosate and then we started taking X2 and B12 and about a year or so later my wife got pregnant with our baby boy and with the iodine that she was taking and everything he's so bright and you can just see the glow in his face and he's always smiling and we just owe it all to you and you're our hero Alex.
[03:30:23.447 --> 03:30:24.769]  Well, that's just beautiful, brother.
[03:30:25.069 --> 03:30:28.212]  And again, it shows the system knows all this.
[03:30:28.553 --> 03:30:32.898]  And it works to keep the people from just getting basic things the body has to have.
[03:30:32.938 --> 03:30:35.481]  You have to have vitamin C. You have to have iodine.
[03:30:35.821 --> 03:30:36.702]  You have to have water.
[03:30:37.002 --> 03:30:37.984]  You have to have oxygen.
[03:30:38.404 --> 03:30:40.746]  Instead, the whole system works to block that.
[03:30:40.866 --> 03:30:41.907]  It's just so powerful.
[03:30:41.987 --> 03:30:43.067]  It's what we're made of.
[03:30:43.187 --> 03:30:45.349]  And I'm sitting here trying to explain this to people.
[03:30:45.369 --> 03:30:46.890]  We're not just making this stuff up.
[03:30:47.070 --> 03:30:48.171]  It's just everything.
[03:30:48.191 --> 03:30:50.072]  But again, the other iodines are bound.
[03:30:50.092 --> 03:30:51.213]  You don't absorb them.
[03:30:51.654 --> 03:30:53.075]  Everyone calls their iodine atomic.
[03:30:53.315 --> 03:30:55.736]  I wish everyone else was selling atomic iodine.
[03:30:55.837 --> 03:30:56.217]  They're not.
[03:30:56.397 --> 03:30:58.118]  Impolwarestore.com or AAA2533139.
[03:31:09.122 --> 03:31:11.344]  We're going to talk to Jason in Florida.
[03:31:12.004 --> 03:31:13.225]  Jason, thanks for calling in.
[03:31:13.505 --> 03:31:14.886]  What's your view on the situation?
[03:31:15.126 --> 03:31:16.347]  How should Trump take action?
[03:31:16.807 --> 03:31:18.829]  First of all, I'd like to plug products.
[03:31:19.129 --> 03:31:21.571]  My son and I are both big Super Blue fans.
[03:31:21.691 --> 03:31:25.894]  My son also takes the Honor Roll, which is a fantastic product.
[03:31:25.954 --> 03:31:28.615]  Originally, they wanted to test him for ADHD.
[03:31:28.735 --> 03:31:30.236]  Well, that wasn't the case at all.
[03:31:30.297 --> 03:31:31.858]  He's just a really smart kid.
[03:31:31.938 --> 03:31:36.221]  So the Honor Roll product, amazing, amazing results from that product.
[03:31:36.261 --> 03:31:38.262]  Mr. Jones, thank you very much for everything.
[03:31:38.322 --> 03:31:41.786]  Since you raised it, it's doing our research with top companies.
[03:31:41.866 --> 03:31:47.293]  It's one of the highest rated blends of fish oil, particularly with small caplets for children.
[03:31:47.313 --> 03:31:49.515]  And it's had the mercury taken out of it.
[03:31:49.996 --> 03:31:52.799]  And they found that it's really a missing link in a lot of young people's brains.
[03:31:53.240 --> 03:31:54.101]  What effect did it have?
[03:31:54.361 --> 03:31:56.342]  I actually allowed him to focus.
[03:31:56.422 --> 03:32:00.343]  As a five-year-old kid, he was having a little trouble staying in his seat and things like that.
[03:32:00.523 --> 03:32:02.204]  And, you know, I feed him well.
[03:32:02.224 --> 03:32:03.185]  He exercises.
[03:32:03.225 --> 03:32:04.985]  We swim every day and things like that.
[03:32:05.085 --> 03:32:11.968]  But the reality is, I just think his diet was missing something that over the last year of using the Honor Roll product off the charts.
[03:32:12.048 --> 03:32:16.790]  He's testing in the top percentages of his class, and it's just people are beside themselves.
[03:32:16.910 --> 03:32:18.931]  And, you know, I swear by the product.
[03:32:18.991 --> 03:32:19.331]  I wouldn't
[03:32:19.411 --> 03:32:19.951]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:32:19.971 --> 03:32:21.553]  I mean, you know, I'm not going to turn him away from it.
[03:32:21.573 --> 03:32:22.733]  He even tells me every morning he doesn't have it.
[03:32:22.753 --> 03:32:22.854]  Daddy.
[03:32:22.874 --> 03:32:36.624]  I just don't feel as well as I did the other day, and I think a lot of it has to do with the young developing mind and body and without the you know the product, I will say that on my own personal experience, I will say these products work and that I thank you and my son.
[03:32:36.664 --> 03:32:37.805]  Also, thank you for him as
[03:32:38.305 --> 03:32:39.666]  Jason, thank you for your support.
[03:32:39.867 --> 03:32:42.049]  Good, clean fish oil, or krill oil.
[03:32:42.369 --> 03:32:43.070]  There's nothing better.
[03:32:43.110 --> 03:32:49.737]  I mean, with my own children, one of my daughters, she can kind of get up, low blood sugar, be a little bit grumpy, get her to eat some basic food, then she's not grumpy.
[03:32:49.757 --> 03:32:53.041]  But when she takes her fish oil, she goes, Daddy, I feel so much better after I take it.
[03:32:53.061 --> 03:32:53.882]  I'm like, absolutely.
[03:32:53.922 --> 03:32:54.603]  So thank you, Jason.
[03:33:06.041 --> 03:33:08.742]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.509 --> 03:33:23.409]  You found it.
[03:33:23.730 --> 03:33:25.250]  The tip of the spear.
[03:33:25.791 --> 03:33:30.473]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:33:32.708 --> 03:33:34.930]  Joe Biden says he's coming for your guns.
[03:33:34.990 --> 03:33:41.334]  He wants federal agents to go door-to-door and confiscate your legal firearms at gunpoint.
[03:33:41.935 --> 03:33:45.957]  This came out during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper today.
[03:33:46.998 --> 03:33:54.023]  And he said, bingo, when Anderson Cooper said, you mean you want federal agents basically to go door-to-door and confiscate guns?
[03:33:54.484 --> 03:33:56.485]  I mean, I'm paraphrasing, but that's essentially what he said.
[03:33:56.805 --> 03:33:59.007]  And Joe Biden says, yes, that's exactly what he wants.
[03:33:59.527 --> 03:34:00.608]  So let's have no illusions.
[03:34:01.593 --> 03:34:14.335]  The Democrats, if any of them get into power, they are planning to go door-to-door, essentially with guns in your face, either shooting you or arresting you, or maybe just mass-executing you.
[03:34:14.375 --> 03:34:20.076]  That's what the Democrats seem to want, if you don't turn in your guns, your legal guns.
[03:34:20.717 --> 03:34:28.438]  Meanwhile, the criminals will have all the guns, you know, in the world, because of course they don't follow the laws, and they're not going to turn them in, and so on and so forth.
[03:34:29.210 --> 03:34:38.594]  So this is at the same time that leftists are now posting posters and flyers in New York City now that call for death camps for Trump supporters.
[03:34:39.434 --> 03:34:40.855]  Death camps for Trump supporters.
[03:34:41.595 --> 03:34:43.536]  So these two things go together.
[03:34:43.976 --> 03:34:49.658]  And by the way, those flyers have been posted on the vehicles of a GOP staffer that has now been reported.
[03:34:49.698 --> 03:34:54.900]  I don't have the name of that staffer, but that just came out a few minutes ago before I went on the show here live.
[03:34:55.999 --> 03:35:01.470]  So, of course they want to put you in death camps, but to do that they have to take your guns first, right?
[03:35:02.131 --> 03:35:06.780]  Because, of course, the radical left is following in the footsteps of Adolf Hitler.
[03:35:07.805 --> 03:35:13.550]  And as you know, if you've studied history at all, you know that Adolf Hitler passed the Gun Control Act.
[03:35:13.611 --> 03:35:30.186]  I think it was 1933 was the big gun control act that he passed to take away guns from his political enemies, making it all the easier to round them up and put them on the railroad cars and ship them off to concentration camps
[03:35:30.746 --> 03:35:33.609]  You're not just fighting for a political outcome here.
[03:35:49.992 --> 03:35:55.814]  If you support Trump and you support the Constitution, you support the Bill of Rights, you're not just fighting for a political situation.
[03:35:56.354 --> 03:36:01.235]  You are, at this point, from this day forward, you are fighting for your very life.
[03:36:01.976 --> 03:36:04.116]  You are fighting for your survival.
[03:36:04.576 --> 03:36:10.738]  And by fighting, I mean defending America, defending your life, defending your right to speak.
[03:36:11.478 --> 03:36:14.899]  You are fighting for your right to exist.
[03:36:15.679 --> 03:36:17.240]  And note that
[03:36:18.001 --> 03:36:30.129]  Twitter has now allowed a former CNN journalist to call for the eradication of all Trump supporters along with Conway there.
[03:36:30.669 --> 03:36:34.552]  And Twitter thinks there's no problem with that quote.
[03:36:35.032 --> 03:36:37.754]  The eradication of all Trump supporters.
[03:36:38.114 --> 03:36:39.035]  Now think about this.
[03:36:40.356 --> 03:36:53.860]  If you say, if you were to switch that around and let's just say you called for the eradication of all Obama supporters or the eradication of all transgenders, let's say, oh my gosh, you would be accused of massive hate speech and genocide.
[03:36:54.320 --> 03:36:55.800]  You would be the worst person in the world.
[03:36:55.820 --> 03:36:57.701]  There'd be stories about you nationwide.
[03:36:58.241 --> 03:37:03.822]  But if you call for the eradication of Trump supporters, you are celebrated by Twitter.
[03:37:04.383 --> 03:37:05.963]  You are celebrated by Facebook.
[03:37:06.043 --> 03:37:09.684]  You are celebrated by Google, which just proves that the radical left,
[03:37:10.313 --> 03:37:14.055]  Has become now in favor of death camps.
[03:37:14.735 --> 03:37:16.136]  They're in favor of death camps.
[03:37:16.216 --> 03:37:18.697]  They want death camps for all Trump supporters.
[03:37:18.998 --> 03:37:20.598]  They are openly calling for it.
[03:37:20.638 --> 03:37:24.981]  This is a former CNN journalist that's openly calling for this eradication.
[03:37:25.481 --> 03:37:26.401]  This is what they want.
[03:37:27.002 --> 03:37:31.844]  And Joe Biden says they're going to go door to door and put guns in your faces with federal agents.
[03:37:32.024 --> 03:37:35.486]  And they're going to essentially either take your guns or shoot you in the process.
[03:37:36.126 --> 03:37:36.947]  This is no longer
[03:37:38.522 --> 03:37:41.144]  Just a guess of what the Democrats want.
[03:37:41.564 --> 03:37:44.527]  This is their game plan, and they now openly admit it.
[03:37:45.207 --> 03:37:48.470]  I'm going to give you a couple of practical things here that you can do.
[03:37:48.610 --> 03:37:56.435]  So if they come for your guns, then the government has become an Orwellian, tyrannical, authoritarian society.
[03:37:57.056 --> 03:38:05.702]  And according to the Founding Fathers, it is your duty to resist that tyranny, in fact, to overcome that tyranny, to defeat that tyranny.
[03:38:05.742 --> 03:38:07.664]  That is your duty as an American.
[03:38:08.374 --> 03:38:14.499]  And there are some ways to do that that you can start to prep right now using legal means.
[03:38:14.519 --> 03:38:16.860]  I'm going to cover a couple of those real quick here.
[03:38:17.941 --> 03:38:25.286]  It is legal in almost everywhere in America to manufacture your own firearm for your own personal use and for your self-defense.
[03:38:26.047 --> 03:38:27.788]  And some of you may recognize this right here.
[03:38:28.328 --> 03:38:30.170]  This is a Polymer 80.
[03:38:30.990 --> 03:38:37.195]  This is the shell of a Polymer 80 handgun that you can purchase this Polymer 80 shell
[03:38:38.044 --> 03:38:44.050]  And just using a drill, a drill bit, you can drill the holes in here for the pins.
[03:38:44.350 --> 03:38:46.512]  This is basically a Glock clone.
[03:38:47.033 --> 03:38:54.079]  And then using a drill press, just a simple drill press, you drill off a few parts and you are manufacturing your own handgun.
[03:38:54.780 --> 03:38:59.144]  And then you assemble it using a Glock slide and Glock slide parts.
[03:38:59.965 --> 03:39:03.048]  And you have yourself a legal pistol.
[03:39:04.068 --> 03:39:06.029]  And you can use this for self-defense.
[03:39:06.069 --> 03:39:06.990]  You can own it yourself.
[03:39:07.390 --> 03:39:09.751]  You can make as many of these as you want for yourself.
[03:39:10.252 --> 03:39:12.253]  You can't sell them to others, obviously.
[03:39:12.673 --> 03:39:14.134]  You can't give them to others.
[03:39:14.794 --> 03:39:16.235]  But you can make them for yourself.
[03:39:16.315 --> 03:39:17.556]  It's legal almost everywhere.
[03:39:17.576 --> 03:39:18.857]  But of course, check your local laws.
[03:39:18.917 --> 03:39:20.798]  I always encourage you to keep it legal.
[03:39:21.539 --> 03:39:23.640]  Now, you should be doing this right now.
[03:39:24.081 --> 03:39:25.221]  I've done this myself.
[03:39:25.441 --> 03:39:26.482]  It works very well.
[03:39:26.922 --> 03:39:27.683]  And here's a tip.
[03:39:28.243 --> 03:39:32.966]  When you do that, the gun won't cycle very well at first because the parts are quite tight.
[03:39:33.406 --> 03:39:34.366]  So you're going to need this.
[03:39:34.987 --> 03:39:37.608]  A mag, magnesium and aluminum polish.
[03:39:38.089 --> 03:39:46.934]  And what you do with this polish is you kind of you kind of smother this polish in the rails where the rails, the Glock slide has
[03:39:49.693 --> 03:40:03.817]  You put this polish in there, and then you fire about 20, 30, 40 rounds through there, and what's happening is the 9mm rounds are cycling the slide and polishing that down, giving it that broken-in kind of function.
[03:40:04.057 --> 03:40:08.878]  You clean off the polish, you clean off the gun, and then you now have a functioning pistol.
[03:40:08.898 --> 03:40:14.200]  Now, if you're watching, you're also seeing on screen there the Defense Distributed Ghost Gunner.
[03:40:14.918 --> 03:40:25.224]  Which is a system that can be used to automate the manufacture of these polymer 80 pistols, as well as AR-15 receivers.
[03:40:26.065 --> 03:40:29.067]  Now, I've used the Ghost Gunner for both functions.
[03:40:29.427 --> 03:40:30.247]  I own a Ghost Gunner.
[03:40:30.648 --> 03:40:31.248]  I think it's great.
[03:40:31.977 --> 03:40:42.685]  And Defense Distributed, by the way, I think sent an email out this morning saying that they only have 120 of those machines left for sale here in this year.
[03:40:43.285 --> 03:40:45.006]  So there's not a lot of those machines available.
[03:40:45.026 --> 03:40:49.410]  If you want one, you might want to get one now because they're going to be impossible to get.
[03:40:50.090 --> 03:40:51.491]  But I've owned one for quite some time.
[03:40:51.911 --> 03:40:58.656]  I've used that Ghost Gunner to work on the Polymer 80 pistols, but I found it's actually easier just to use a drill press for the pistols.
[03:40:59.277 --> 03:41:00.858]  When it comes to aluminum
[03:41:01.972 --> 03:41:06.055]  AR-15 lowers, as they're called, or lower receivers.
[03:41:07.216 --> 03:41:08.597]  The Ghost Gunner works very, very well.
[03:41:09.218 --> 03:41:12.300]  Now, I've been able to make it work with anodized lowers.
[03:41:12.741 --> 03:41:16.283]  Most people think it only works with raw aluminum, but that's not true.
[03:41:16.784 --> 03:41:18.645]  You can use it with anodized lowers.
[03:41:19.105 --> 03:41:23.429]  All you have to do is Dremel off six areas of that lower receiver.
[03:41:24.469 --> 03:41:32.997]  And the six areas are the areas where the bit of that machine makes contact with the receiver to complete a circuit of conductivity.
[03:41:33.017 --> 03:41:43.506]  That's how it it knows the X, Y and Z positions of your lower receiver so that it can drill the pinholes, you know, the trigger hole, you know, everything in the appropriate place.
[03:41:43.526 --> 03:41:45.128]  So you can put the trigger group in there and so on.
[03:41:45.828 --> 03:41:46.589]  And it works great.
[03:41:47.310 --> 03:41:48.831]  I'm telling you, the Ghost Gunner work.
[03:41:49.131 --> 03:41:49.772]  It's fantastic.
[03:41:50.589 --> 03:42:03.751]  The reason I mention both of these things, the Polymer 80 and the Ghost Gunner, is because this is a legal way to manufacture firearms that are not on anybody's books somewhere.
[03:42:05.086 --> 03:42:07.367]  And again, follow all your local laws.
[03:42:07.707 --> 03:42:08.347]  I always do.
[03:42:08.887 --> 03:42:10.247]  I don't own any illegal weapons.
[03:42:10.287 --> 03:42:12.408]  I don't own any automatic weapons, nothing like that.
[03:42:12.448 --> 03:42:13.248]  I keep it all legal.
[03:42:13.728 --> 03:42:16.089]  But the Founding Fathers gave you the right to do this.
[03:42:16.529 --> 03:42:29.352]  You should exercise those rights so that if Joe Biden, God forbid, were elected president and he were to send federal agents to your door and they put a gun in your face and say, give us all your guns and you were forced to do that.
[03:42:29.772 --> 03:42:34.493]  Well, you give them the guns they know about and then you keep the guns they don't because guess what?
[03:42:35.279 --> 03:42:43.184]  The Founding Fathers already gave us permission to defeat tyranny, and you're going to need legal firearms in order to get that done if it goes to that point.
[03:42:43.684 --> 03:42:45.766]  So follow the law, but be prepared.
[03:42:46.446 --> 03:42:50.269]  Make sure that you have the gear that you need to defend your nation against tyranny.
[03:42:51.109 --> 03:42:52.110]  Much more straight ahead.
[03:42:52.130 --> 03:42:54.371]  This is Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:54.391 --> 03:42:55.332]  We'll be back after this break.
[03:43:01.872 --> 03:43:02.792]  The globalists are.
[03:43:21.380 --> 03:43:31.724]  Individual psychotics attacking that one group, where the individual attack is not predictable, but the general trend of it is predictable.
[03:43:31.904 --> 03:43:43.349]  I think that at the end of the day, especially because this was a white supremacist manifesto, that I want to say with more moral clarity that Donald Trump is responsible for this.
[03:43:43.989 --> 03:43:56.643]  I think the president has to bear some responsibility for creating a culture in the United States around race-baiting, around demonizing people of color, around demonizing immigrants.
[03:43:56.763 --> 03:44:00.728]  We have a president of the United States who has embraced white nationalism.
[03:44:00.888 --> 03:44:04.912]  And now, America is under attack from domestic white nationalist terror.
[03:44:05.032 --> 03:44:05.952]  White nationalist.
[03:44:05.992 --> 03:44:07.093]  White supremacist.
[03:44:07.153 --> 03:44:08.214]  Racist hatred.
[03:44:08.355 --> 03:44:09.235]  White nationalism.
[03:44:09.576 --> 03:44:10.456]  White nationalist violence.
[03:44:10.496 --> 03:44:12.258]  White nationalist terrorism.
[03:44:12.318 --> 03:44:13.199]  White nationalists.
[03:44:13.399 --> 03:44:14.160]  White nationalism.
[03:44:14.220 --> 03:44:15.721]  White nationalism.
[03:44:15.761 --> 03:44:16.822]  White nationalism.
[03:44:17.022 --> 03:44:18.622]  The president has stoked the flames.
[03:44:18.702 --> 03:44:19.763]  He has emboldened it.
[03:44:19.863 --> 03:44:21.283]  He has given it power.
[03:44:21.383 --> 03:44:22.464]  He has elevated it.
[03:44:23.284 --> 03:44:24.664]  He has coddled it.
[03:44:25.484 --> 03:44:26.825]  And he's got to stop.
[03:44:26.945 --> 03:44:29.646]  This is the environment that the president has created.
[03:44:29.686 --> 03:44:30.746]  He's made it okay.
[03:44:30.846 --> 03:44:40.729]  He is responsible for what is going on and is doing nothing, nothing to stop the carnage and the chaos.
[03:44:41.089 --> 03:44:44.590]  I'm incredibly saddened and it's very hard to think about this.
[03:44:46.491 --> 03:44:53.855]  Our president right now is using the same language of racism, of bigotry, and white supremacy.
[03:44:54.255 --> 03:44:54.975]  He is a racist.
[03:44:55.155 --> 03:44:59.738]  Donald Trump talks like a racist, thinks like a racist, makes statements like a racist.
[03:45:00.038 --> 03:45:03.099]  Yeah, he's a racist because racism is as racism does.
[03:45:03.360 --> 03:45:05.801]  He must be held responsible.
[03:45:05.981 --> 03:45:07.182]  It's a national embarrassment.
[03:45:07.202 --> 03:45:13.707]  I mean, who cares how strong our economy is, or how strong our military is, if Americans are killing Americans?
[03:45:13.727 --> 03:45:18.151]  When you read that manifesto, it looked like it could have been written by a Trump speechwriter.
[03:45:33.041 --> 03:45:35.322]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[03:45:35.722 --> 03:45:41.744]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[03:45:42.084 --> 03:45:43.824]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[03:47:05.971 --> 03:47:09.973]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.996 --> 03:47:19.016]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:19.396 --> 03:47:23.338]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:47:24.659 --> 03:47:35.403]  Okay, I have the name now of the GOP representative in New York whose staffers have been targeted with those death camp
[03:47:36.121 --> 03:47:37.445]  Uh, posters and flyers.
[03:47:38.166 --> 03:47:44.101]  That GOP rep is named Lee Zeldin of New York, Republican New York.
[03:47:44.953 --> 03:47:51.215]  And staff members are having their homes and cars targeted with death camps for Trump supporters, flyers.
[03:47:51.735 --> 03:48:02.117]  So this is yet another indication of the radicalization of the lunatic left and how their agenda, which they used to try to hide, is now right out in the open.
[03:48:02.597 --> 03:48:12.800]  This is really a milestone day where Joe Biden says, yes, he's going to send armed federal agents to your house, door to door, to take your guns at gunpoint and
[03:48:13.507 --> 03:48:18.271]  Then a GOP rep in New York has staffers, you know, threatened with death camps.
[03:48:18.911 --> 03:48:21.173]  So it's time to ask yourself a question.
[03:48:21.974 --> 03:48:33.063]  The question is, if for some reason Joe Biden were to become president, or some other Democrat, because of course Google's trying to steal the election, there's going to be massive voter fraud in places like California and New York.
[03:48:34.604 --> 03:48:40.389]  Are you willing to lay down your arms and go to a left-wing death camp?
[03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:41.790]  I'm serious.
[03:48:42.446 --> 03:48:43.807]  It's time to ask yourself this question.
[03:48:44.548 --> 03:48:57.277]  Because if your answer is that you don't want to rock the boat and you just want to go along and get along, then you might as well, of course I don't mean this literally, but you might as well just, you know, kill yourself right now because that's what they're going to do to you.
[03:48:57.918 --> 03:48:58.718]  That's what they're going to do.
[03:48:59.399 --> 03:49:01.340]  They want you dead.
[03:49:02.221 --> 03:49:06.324]  So if they come for your guns, understand that they are the criminals.
[03:49:07.245 --> 03:49:09.347]  They are violating the law of the land.
[03:49:09.647 --> 03:49:12.770]  They are violating the Second Amendment.
[03:49:13.110 --> 03:49:24.479]  And it is your job to say, no, no, we will not go along with your Third Reich regime, your death camps, your Zyklon B gas chambers.
[03:49:25.039 --> 03:49:30.303]  We're not going to give you our guns so that you can then come back and murder all of us, which is exactly what the left wants to do.
[03:49:30.323 --> 03:49:36.168]  I mean, they put out a new, you see that trailer, that new movie where they're just running around hunting Trump supporters and killing them.
[03:49:36.846 --> 03:49:45.493]  I think, uh, and then Netflix has a new series called Dear White People that just basically says all white people are KKK members and racist and implies they all need to be killed.
[03:49:45.513 --> 03:49:52.298]  I mean, this is, this is becoming dangerously insane, but that's exactly the point.
[03:49:52.758 --> 03:49:56.821]  Let me tell you the big secret about what the globalists and the left-wing media are trying to do.
[03:49:57.422 --> 03:50:03.807]  They're trying to get you, a conservative or a Trump supporter, they're trying to get you to shoot first.
[03:50:04.551 --> 03:50:11.353]  Because they know, what I've told you many times, that in the coming Civil War, whoever shoots first, loses.
[03:50:12.333 --> 03:50:16.134]  They want to drive you to the point of you carrying out a mass shooting.
[03:50:16.915 --> 03:50:24.897]  And I don't mean like a mass shooting run by an FBI recruiting some person to go shoot up some retail establishment, because they're going to do that, of course, as many times as they can.
[03:50:25.557 --> 03:50:28.258]  I'm talking about they want to drive you
[03:50:29.133 --> 03:50:30.594]  A real conservative.
[03:50:30.614 --> 03:50:34.317]  They want to drive you to a mass shooting because they want to drive you crazy.
[03:50:34.377 --> 03:50:35.638]  They want to weaponize you.
[03:50:35.658 --> 03:50:37.479]  They want to get you angry and get you to act.
[03:50:38.254 --> 03:50:41.335]  Your job is to not initiate violence.
[03:50:41.815 --> 03:50:43.135]  Do not initiate violence.
[03:50:43.195 --> 03:50:47.256]  Even when you're manufacturing your own firearms for self-defense, like I covered in the last section.
[03:50:47.856 --> 03:50:49.996]  That is to defend yourself.
[03:50:50.396 --> 03:50:52.016]  That is to stop violence.
[03:50:52.456 --> 03:50:53.497]  Not to start violence.
[03:50:53.837 --> 03:50:54.917]  Not to initiate violence.
[03:50:55.257 --> 03:50:56.977]  Whoever shoots first loses.
[03:50:57.537 --> 03:50:59.878]  They're trying to whip you up into that condition.
[03:51:00.378 --> 03:51:06.939]  Now, if they can't do that, if they can't get a bunch of conservatives to open fire first, then they're going to stage it themselves.
[03:51:07.594 --> 03:51:12.598]  So I would expect to see in the next big Antifa gathering, guess what?
[03:51:13.118 --> 03:51:19.863]  Gonna be possibly a false flag event that would target and kill a whole lot of Antifa people to be blamed on a conservative.
[03:51:19.883 --> 03:51:24.426]  Because they can't get conservatives to do that organically, so they have to fake it.
[03:51:24.466 --> 03:51:27.128]  I mean, real violence, fake narrative.
[03:51:27.408 --> 03:51:28.309]  They have to whip it up.
[03:51:28.369 --> 03:51:29.370]  They have to pretend.
[03:51:29.910 --> 03:51:33.332]  You know, or they have an MKUltra person or a sock puppet person or what have you.
[03:51:33.372 --> 03:51:34.273]  You know the story.
[03:51:34.813 --> 03:51:35.494]  You know how this works.
[03:51:36.417 --> 03:51:40.043]  But they're going to have to try to pretend that conservatives are opening fire.
[03:51:40.905 --> 03:51:46.976]  Now, as all of this is happening, the goal of the radical left is to burn this country down.
[03:51:47.802 --> 03:51:48.723]  This is what they want.
[03:51:48.903 --> 03:51:51.305]  Mass violence on the streets of America.
[03:51:51.865 --> 03:51:54.527]  They want people to kill each other.
[03:51:54.547 --> 03:51:55.948]  They want blood running in the streets.
[03:51:55.988 --> 03:51:57.609]  They want the economy to melt down.
[03:51:58.029 --> 03:51:59.791]  They want the rule of law to collapse.
[03:52:00.291 --> 03:52:01.091]  This is what they want.
[03:52:01.412 --> 03:52:10.118]  Because the left is so dangerous, and so radical, and so unhinged, that in their minds they've decided, hey, if they can't run it, they're going to burn it down.
[03:52:10.738 --> 03:52:11.259]  You understand?
[03:52:11.799 --> 03:52:13.020]  They want to burn this country down.
[03:52:13.855 --> 03:52:14.395]  Or rule it.
[03:52:14.515 --> 03:52:15.736]  One or the other.
[03:52:15.956 --> 03:52:16.977]  They're fine either way.
[03:52:17.037 --> 03:52:20.619]  They want to rule it like the globalists rule Mexico.
[03:52:20.659 --> 03:52:36.388]  They want to have the ruling elite and the impoverished, disarmed masses with a bunch of drug cartels paying off the corrupt officials to traffic narcotics and traffic human children and whatever else they're doing across the border, which is all sick stuff.
[03:52:37.348 --> 03:52:38.429]  But if they can't have that,
[03:52:39.341 --> 03:52:44.604]  If there's a country that's anything resembling freedom, they want to burn it down.
[03:52:45.124 --> 03:52:46.905]  And that is their goal.
[03:52:47.345 --> 03:52:57.090]  So what they're doing now, think about how they're blaming guns, and they're calling for red flag laws, but they won't look at the causes of so-called mental illness.
[03:52:57.650 --> 03:53:00.412]  They try to blame mental illness, but they never mention what?
[03:53:01.665 --> 03:53:09.647]  SSRI drugs, antidepressant drugs, which are the true cause of mental illness in so many of these young shooters.
[03:53:10.028 --> 03:53:15.469]  In fact, SSRI drugs have been linked to nearly every mass shooting in the last 30 years.
[03:53:15.769 --> 03:53:18.210]  Not 100% of them, but the vast majority.
[03:53:18.795 --> 03:53:18.935]  I don't
[03:53:38.174 --> 03:53:48.839]  There is a genetic difference in young white males where they are unable to break down some of these SSRI drugs or similar medications.
[03:53:48.899 --> 03:53:52.761]  They're unable to break them down because they're lacking a certain enzyme.
[03:53:53.562 --> 03:54:01.045]  And because of this, those drugs have a heightened response in certain individuals that have this particular genetic predisposition.
[03:54:01.946 --> 03:54:03.947]  So how do we really solve that problem?
[03:54:03.967 --> 03:54:04.607]  It's very simple.
[03:54:05.293 --> 03:54:10.139]  You do genetic testing before you put people on antidepressant drugs.
[03:54:11.360 --> 03:54:12.141]  It's a simple thing.
[03:54:12.261 --> 03:54:13.443]  You do genetic testing first.
[03:54:13.463 --> 03:54:15.625]  You make sure they don't have this genetic difference.
[03:54:15.966 --> 03:54:16.967]  Maybe you call it a defect.
[03:54:17.628 --> 03:54:23.495]  But you can't put people on SSRI drugs if they have this genetic difference because then their brains go crazy.
[03:54:24.068 --> 03:54:27.833]  And then they think that they're playing out a video game, you know, like the Columbine shooters.
[03:54:27.873 --> 03:54:33.961]  They think they're in an artificial reality, in many cases, and they're carrying out this shooting, and their mind is not even real.
[03:54:34.422 --> 03:54:42.212]  And when they come down off the drugs, they're shocked and surprised at what happened, because it wasn't even their conscious will to do what they...
[03:54:43.092 --> 03:54:43.272]  I'm good.
[03:54:58.396 --> 03:54:59.236]  You know, give me a break.
[03:54:59.656 --> 03:55:04.438]  There's nothing wrong with the brains of most of these kids until they get put on these psychiatric drugs.
[03:55:05.018 --> 03:55:12.801]  And then when they turn into mass shooters because the psych drugs have been combined with the hatred of the left-wing media, what does the radical left say?
[03:55:12.961 --> 03:55:14.461]  Oh, it's the fault of the guns.
[03:55:15.341 --> 03:55:16.442]  No, no, wait, wait a second.
[03:55:16.522 --> 03:55:17.002]  Wait a second.
[03:55:18.303 --> 03:55:23.384]  Maybe leftists have never looked at a gun, but a gun has a trigger that has to be pulled by a finger, right?
[03:55:23.424 --> 03:55:24.344]  You have to pull it with a finger.
[03:55:24.764 --> 03:55:26.385]  The finger is attached to the arm.
[03:55:26.685 --> 03:55:28.105]  The arm is attached to the shoulder.
[03:55:28.405 --> 03:55:32.706]  Shoulder is attached to the torso, through the neck, attached to the brain, right?
[03:55:33.106 --> 03:55:41.688]  Oh, the brain makes the decision to pull the trigger, and the brain is on psychiatric drugs in so many cases with these young shooters.
[03:55:42.328 --> 03:55:43.829]  That's the core issue here.
[03:55:44.149 --> 03:55:48.232]  There's no finger that pulls a trigger on its own without the brain being involved.
[03:55:49.113 --> 03:55:52.435]  And if you don't believe me, you know, go look around.
[03:55:52.455 --> 03:55:54.656]  There are no headless shooters in the world.
[03:55:54.716 --> 03:55:55.917]  Headless mass shooters!
[03:55:55.997 --> 03:55:57.378]  Oh my god, it's a zombie fest!
[03:55:57.438 --> 03:55:58.178]  It's a horror movie!
[03:55:58.479 --> 03:55:59.519]  The headless shooter!
[03:55:59.739 --> 03:56:00.740]  No, doesn't exist.
[03:56:01.541 --> 03:56:06.143]  There are also no guns that break into Walmart stores and shoot themselves.
[03:56:06.784 --> 03:56:09.045]  You don't see guns running down the aisles of the stores.
[03:56:09.105 --> 03:56:10.426]  Oh my god, there's an AK-47 with feet!
[03:56:12.256 --> 03:56:12.857]  It's running!
[03:56:13.257 --> 03:56:14.198]  The rifle is running!
[03:56:14.258 --> 03:56:15.360]  It's reloading itself!
[03:56:15.420 --> 03:56:17.222]  Look, it's aiming and firing itself!
[03:56:17.842 --> 03:56:18.463]  Never happens.
[03:56:18.843 --> 03:56:20.625]  Has never happened and never will happen.
[03:56:21.606 --> 03:56:24.449]  It takes a brain to decide to pull the trigger.
[03:56:24.850 --> 03:56:33.299]  When that brain is bathed in toxic medication chemicals, you get violence because you get a brain that's dissociated from reality.
[03:56:33.908 --> 03:56:49.053]  And then those brains are further brainwashed by the left-wing media, so you get massive hatred, you get a weaponization of the psychology of the country, and you get the left-wing media's successful PSYOP being run on the entire country.
[03:56:49.473 --> 03:57:00.477]  They want to weaponize people because they hate America, they want to burn this country down, and most of the left-wing media gets paid by Big Pharma to promote antidepressant drugs with advertising money.
[03:57:01.112 --> 03:57:02.253]  So is it starting to make sense now?
[03:57:02.814 --> 03:57:04.595]  You see how all the pieces really fit together?
[03:57:05.196 --> 03:57:07.358]  But of course they say, no, it's the fault of Trump.
[03:57:07.678 --> 03:57:07.958]  Really?
[03:57:08.459 --> 03:57:14.804]  It's the fault of Trump that all these psych drugs are being handed out like candy to all these young white males, typically?
[03:57:15.865 --> 03:57:22.031]  It's the fault of Trump that the media is spewing hatred and even calling for terrorism and calling for violence?
[03:57:22.371 --> 03:57:23.412]  How is that Trump's fault?
[03:57:23.732 --> 03:57:24.413]  Of course it isn't.
[03:57:25.111 --> 03:57:26.612]  And Tucker Carlson is right, by the way.
[03:57:26.652 --> 03:57:30.894]  It's a massive media hoax to claim that white supremacy is taking over this country.
[03:57:30.914 --> 03:57:33.095]  It's a hoax, just like the Russia collusion hoax.
[03:57:34.115 --> 03:57:37.817]  In any case, you're going to get the truth by tuning in here at Infowars.com.
[03:57:38.197 --> 03:57:40.358]  Owen Schroer is coming up next on The War Room.
[03:57:40.758 --> 03:57:42.699]  Alex may be stepping in to co-host that.
[03:57:43.199 --> 03:57:44.840]  I appreciate you tuning in today.
[03:57:44.880 --> 03:57:46.841]  This is Mike Adams for The Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:47.061 --> 03:57:47.801]  Thanks for watching.
[03:57:47.982 --> 03:57:48.702]  Talk to you next time.
[03:57:53.792 --> 03:57:54.513]  I'm good.
[03:58:09.815 --> 03:58:11.276]  Now the Democrats are coming.
[03:58:11.876 --> 03:58:17.600]  Now to Decision 2020 as the Democratic candidates for president descend on Detroit.
[03:58:17.620 --> 03:58:19.862]  20 presidential candidates will head to Detroit.
[03:58:20.162 --> 03:58:22.104]  Democratic presidential primary debates.
[03:58:22.144 --> 03:58:25.286]  This time the candidates are making their case in Detroit.
[03:58:25.406 --> 03:58:28.868]  Tonight, Democratic presidential debate event in Detroit.
[03:58:40.614 --> 03:58:43.076]  This moment will define us forever.
[03:58:43.096 --> 03:58:46.577]  I'm running for president because our country is running out of time.
[03:58:47.018 --> 03:58:49.179]  And I'm here to say this isn't about left or right.
[03:58:49.859 --> 03:58:52.080]  This is about new and better.
[03:58:52.600 --> 03:58:53.381]  Free everything.
[03:58:53.981 --> 03:58:56.622]  Our problems didn't start with Donald Trump.
[03:58:56.943 --> 03:58:59.044]  You're going to hear a lot of promises up here.
