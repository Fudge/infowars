[00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:03.010]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are already in a civil war.
[00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.812]  The globalists do plan to overthrow Trump.
[00:00:07.352 --> 00:00:08.953]  Rush Limbaugh knocks it out of the park Friday.
[00:00:08.973 --> 00:00:09.673]  Here's a clip of him.
[00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.754]  There really is no whistleblower.
[00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:14.976]  This is just a leaker who followed
[00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:20.808]  Procedures that have been established to give whistleblowers protection.
[00:00:20.848 --> 00:00:22.069]  The whole thing is a sham.
[00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.034]  It's nothing more than the Steele dossier 2.0.
[00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:29.960]  As I have been saying all week, there are a couple of people now have come to this conclusion.
[00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:31.443]  It's the same people.
[00:00:31.943 --> 00:00:41.110]  It's the same scam, it's the same objective, and I'm going to add a name to potential Democrat presidential nominees coming up soon.
[00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:47.655]  And now, from sunny South Florida, it's Open Line Friday!
[00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:50.637]  Bottom line, there isn't anything really new here.
[00:00:50.698 --> 00:00:53.740]  This is just the next phase of Get Trump.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.005]  This is the next phase of the operation to overturn the election results of 2016.
[00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:01.486]  It's the same players.
[00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:03.908]  It's the same technique.
[00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:05.629]  It's the same play.
[00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.956]  The whistleblower report, it was probably prepared with the assistance of House Intelligence Committee staffers.
[00:01:16.898 --> 00:01:18.519]  Nothing about this is genuine.
[00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:24.524]  There's no real whistleblower who's terribly alarmed and upset over what Trump said on the phone call.
[00:01:24.564 --> 00:01:26.125]  The whistleblower didn't even hear it.
[00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:29.602]  It's just the next phase.
[00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:32.823]  It's the same play, run to the different side of the line.
[00:01:32.863 --> 00:01:33.764]  Let's put it that way.
[00:01:35.244 --> 00:01:39.066]  And the whistleblower report is the steel dossier all over again.
[00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:44.749]  Some people think that it is the same technique, Christine Bolsey Ford, but she was.
[00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.410]  That whole thing was an extension of the original play.
[00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.831]  What is this really all about?
[00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.900]  What is this really, really all about?
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.141]  It's all about overturning the election results of 2016.
[00:01:57.741 --> 00:02:00.682]  Why is that so important?
[00:02:02.382 --> 00:02:06.384]  It goes beyond just the fact that the deep state lost.
[00:02:08.084 --> 00:02:11.685]  I think what it's about is what I have long thought it's about.
[00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:16.187]  It's about making sure the American people do not learn.
[00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:31.489]  The extent of the corruption in the Obama administration and the Democrat Party at large, and particularly among these people in the deep state who did what they did to deny Trump his election victory.
[00:02:32.543 --> 00:02:37.127]  And that's why Pelosi's out there today saying that Bill Barr has gone rogue.
[00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:50.817]  If you need any evidence that they are scared to death of what Barr and his team are investigating, as to the origins of all of this, Pelosi out of the blue saying that Barr has gone rogue.
[00:02:50.857 --> 00:02:52.758]  They are doing everything they can
[00:02:53.988 --> 00:02:57.430]  To destroy everybody on the other side of this.
[00:02:57.891 --> 00:02:59.172]  There's nothing that's true.
[00:02:59.192 --> 00:03:02.254]  You know what really is hard about this?
[00:03:02.934 --> 00:03:06.217]  Is that we're dealing with nothing but a series of abject lies.
[00:03:06.517 --> 00:03:08.038]  Everybody on the left is lying.
[00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:10.460]  Every allegation about this is a lie.
[00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:13.642]  Trump hasn't broken any laws.
[00:03:13.742 --> 00:03:16.324]  Trump has not engaged in any corruption.
[00:03:16.944 --> 00:03:22.208]  In fact, Trump is the most investigated president in the history of the country and they still haven't found a crime.
[00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:27.294]  They're still looking for a crime, they haven't found a crime, so they're making things up!
[00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:39.278]  The media is not media, it's just Democrats who work in the media, and the whole group of them is aligned, and what we are in the middle of now, folks, is a cold civil war.
[00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.939]  It has begun.
[00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.571]  It is a cold civil war as opposed to hot.
[00:03:47.631 --> 00:03:50.593]  There's no hostilities declared.
[00:03:51.213 --> 00:03:53.614]  There's no two clear sides of this.
[00:03:54.695 --> 00:03:57.597]  And certainly no shots have been fired.
[00:03:58.157 --> 00:04:01.840]  But nevertheless, we're in the midst of a cold civil war.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.461]  And it has taken the
[00:04:05.248 --> 00:04:06.969]  Well, it encompasses a lot of things.
[00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.211]  It encompasses overturning the election results of 2016.
[00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:19.657]  It is about protecting and defending the deep state, the Washington establishment, going forward, their careers, their fortunes, their corruption.
[00:04:21.258 --> 00:04:24.240]  There are terribly big stakes involved here for these people.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.982]  And Trump is on the cusp of overturning it and exposing it.
[00:04:28.062 --> 00:04:29.463]  They cannot allow that to happen.
[00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:31.224]  That is absolutely what's happening.
[00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:31.865]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:31.885 --> 00:04:32.285]  Stay with us.
[00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.531]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, September 30th, 2019.
[00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.572]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:04:42.413 --> 00:04:46.615]  We're going to cover the astounding developments, not just here, but around the world.
[00:04:46.635 --> 00:04:53.378]  We're going to open the phones up as well throughout the transmission today, the entire four hours of my broadcast.
[00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.399]  And then we have Owen Schroer.
[00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:07.711]  From right here in Austin, Texas, in the studio next door to me, I'll be broadcasting and transmitting out on TV and radio and the internet with The War Room, and then 7 to 9, Will Johnson and Tom Papert with Firepower.
[00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:10.413]  And of course, David Knight, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:10.793]  Central.
[00:05:15.478 --> 00:05:22.744]  If I just get up here and chatter off all the news, it really, I think, just becomes part of the background noise, doesn't it?
[00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:44.841]  President Trump tweeted out a couple days ago on Saturday that the United States is in danger of being in a new civil war.
[00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:53.204]  And Rush Limbaugh said that we're in a cold civil war.
[00:05:56.445 --> 00:05:59.928]  Well, both of those statements, depending on your perspective, are true.
[00:05:59.988 --> 00:06:09.435]  But let me tell you from the broadcast that first said this back in July of 2016, when Trump became the nominee.
[00:06:11.617 --> 00:06:13.178]  I said, I believe Trump's going to win.
[00:06:13.198 --> 00:06:19.183]  And I believe that there then is going to be a civil war of some type in this country.
[00:06:19.723 --> 00:06:24.367]  And how politically active we are will depend on how bad the crash landing is going to be.
[00:06:25.896 --> 00:06:30.777]  Because if you study history, dug-in, corrupt individuals like this have nothing to lose.
[00:06:32.117 --> 00:06:35.718]  And they will end up trying to turn over the chessboard when they realize they're losing.
[00:06:38.978 --> 00:06:54.401]  Now, I harped on that ad nauseum, and I've probably aired it since 20 times on election night, when Trump won, Roger Stone looked at me in the studio next door and said, you look like you've been punched in the stomach.
[00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:54.941]  What's wrong?
[00:06:55.947 --> 00:06:58.208]  And I said, Roger, we just got the beachhead.
[00:06:58.248 --> 00:07:00.249]  We just got on the beach at Normandy here.
[00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:02.070]  This country did.
[00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.592]  And the machine guns are about to open up on us.
[00:07:07.492 --> 00:07:11.734]  And the howitzers, the big guns, are about to open up.
[00:07:13.334 --> 00:07:18.437]  And no sooner had that night ended, but the orders went into
[00:07:19.861 --> 00:07:23.664]  Place to trigger total civil war in this country.
[00:07:23.965 --> 00:07:28.408]  And we have it in the WikiLeaks, and we have it from the admissions of what's funding Hollywood.
[00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:43.601]  And the mere fact that the communist Chinese and others are allowed to spend billions per quarter funding civil war mass death movies, new Netflix shows every couple days.
[00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:51.104]  About murdering Trump supporters in mass and killing gun owners and putting us in forced labor camps.
[00:07:53.746 --> 00:07:55.187]  I'll be covering some of that today.
[00:07:55.207 --> 00:08:01.632]  That's some of the stories right here.
[00:08:03.093 --> 00:08:12.060]  In my stack, Netflix movie depicts time-traveling liberals carrying out pre-crime murder of patriots to prevent America uprising against globalism.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.502]  In the year 2020, if you go into the show.
[00:08:16.963 --> 00:08:23.887]  And they're saying you've got to go out and kill all the conservative leaders before they stop the utopia world government that's being built.
[00:08:24.408 --> 00:08:31.673]  That's a highly funded, pushed, recommended by Netflix show with a star studded cast.
[00:08:33.594 --> 00:08:38.417]  And you look at who owns a large portion of the production house?
[00:08:38.477 --> 00:08:39.618]  The Chinese Communist government.
[00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:45.313]  You see, you can't make that up, can you?
[00:08:48.975 --> 00:08:58.780]  And they've got all these movies and all these shows, like The Purge and The Hunt, where the evil right-wingers have got to be killed.
[00:09:01.361 --> 00:09:06.524]  And then President Trump comes out and says, if you do that, it's going to trigger a civil war.
[00:09:09.026 --> 00:09:11.207]  And the usual suspects come out and say,
[00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:14.206]  Oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:15.666]  Nobody's calling for violence.
[00:09:15.906 --> 00:09:20.508]  Oh, Governor Weld called for Trump to be arrested and killed for treason.
[00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:25.650]  All these other Democrats are saying similar things.
[00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:35.834]  And then Trump goes, well, what you're doing is treason through a, quote, whistleblower who's really just a third-party storyteller, not even a leaker.
[00:09:39.016 --> 00:09:41.557]  None of the people that actually heard the phone call did a whistleblower.
[00:09:41.737 --> 00:09:42.397]  It's all made up.
[00:09:44.127 --> 00:09:59.015]  They then turn around and say that when Trump says, you try this, it'll cause a civil war, that he's trying to invoke a civil war, trying to intimidate them, when all Trump's doing is pointing out what's going to happen.
[00:10:00.076 --> 00:10:04.979]  Now, when Trump means a civil war, he means a big, bloody, millions dead.
[00:10:06.749 --> 00:10:25.480]  Because believe me, once the veneer of civilization peels off, and once the shooting war starts, there's been a lot of Santa Clauses that have been making lists and checking it twice, and no one who's naughty and nice, and all the meth-head devil worshippers, and Congress people, and globalists, I mean, the globalists have got their jets all warmed up on the tarmac.
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.321]  This is on record.
[00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:28.402]  They're gonna not be here when this goes down.
[00:10:29.523 --> 00:10:31.204]  And that's what's so dangerous about this is,
[00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:36.907]  The globalists and the CHICOMs funding all this really think they're going to get away with this.
[00:10:37.487 --> 00:10:39.968]  It's very important that they know they're not going to get away with it.
[00:10:44.549 --> 00:10:47.750]  When we come back, I'll play Governor Weld saying he wants to kill the President.
[00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:56.613]  We can also play Phil Mudd, former Deputy Director of the CIA, saying we're going to kill this guy.
[00:10:56.653 --> 00:11:00.974]  Or Chuckie Schumer saying the intelligence agencies have six ways this Sunday to get back at you.
[00:11:03.251 --> 00:11:04.152]  And that's what's going on.
[00:11:04.812 --> 00:11:09.015]  But we should talk about how we counter this, and how we stop this, and how we deal with it.
[00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:15.879]  Now, I said, three plus years ago, we were in a cold civil war, and it was beginning to get hot.
[00:11:15.939 --> 00:11:22.123]  You can just type in coldcivilwarinfowars.com into a search engine, it'll pull up dozens of shows and articles with that in them.
[00:11:22.803 --> 00:11:25.525]  And I described it on a Richter scale of a one to 10.
[00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:28.246]  I said on a civil war, we're at about a three in 2016.
[00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.092]  It's a civil war inside the government, inside the deep state.
[00:11:35.753 --> 00:11:42.257]  And now we're at about a six in a cold civil war.
[00:11:42.317 --> 00:11:49.021]  But when it gets up to a seven, eight, or nine, it then starts cooking off, popping off, and then you get a hot civil war.
[00:11:50.202 --> 00:11:53.404]  And I don't have any dreams or wishes for that.
[00:11:54.344 --> 00:11:55.905]  I'd like to fix everything peacefully.
[00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:58.127]  I'd like to stop all this, but
[00:11:59.773 --> 00:12:01.815]  The globalists are in a mad frenzy.
[00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:16.966]  They smell their own blood, their own piss, and they understand that the clock is running out on them, and that they've committed all these crimes, and that they're going to be defeated.
[00:12:17.907 --> 00:12:28.215]  And so like a giant squid trying to take its prey to the bottom of the ocean with it, it's wrapped around us like a face sucker from Alien, and is not going to go down without a fight.
[00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:37.953]  So we ought to have discussions about the most judicious, proper response to this, as a nation, as a planet, and how we're going to deal with it.
[00:12:37.973 --> 00:12:40.554]  Because these people are psychotic control freaks.
[00:12:41.114 --> 00:12:47.177]  And Thomas Jefferson was once asked, what is the limit to which tyrants will go?
[00:12:47.837 --> 00:12:50.878]  And Jefferson rightfully said, whatever level you will accept.
[00:12:51.259 --> 00:12:53.480]  Because there's no end to these people's depravity.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.521]  There's no giving in, there's no making deals with them.
[00:12:58.766 --> 00:13:12.084]  These are a bunch of people who've had power for a long time, intergenerationally, who just don't know what they're doing, and just can't stop, and can't back down, and they want to be caught, and they want to be destroyed, and they're just power men!
[00:13:12.565 --> 00:13:13.466]  It's called megalomania.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.260]  So what are we going to do?
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.801]  They're not going to stop.
[00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:23.081]  They want to fight.
[00:13:23.301 --> 00:13:24.141]  It's existential.
[00:13:24.201 --> 00:13:26.242]  They believe they must dominate us.
[00:13:26.282 --> 00:13:27.382]  They must absorb us.
[00:13:28.082 --> 00:13:31.743]  They must mount our head on the wall to finally be successful.
[00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:35.864]  It's a little peepee syndrome.
[00:13:37.585 --> 00:13:39.045]  It's a Napoleon syndrome.
[00:13:39.065 --> 00:13:39.885]  A Hitler syndrome.
[00:13:40.225 --> 00:13:41.406]  Call it whatever you want.
[00:13:41.506 --> 00:13:42.486]  It's pure evil.
[00:13:43.257 --> 00:13:47.939]  Jack Dorsey, the head of Twitter's old messages worshiping Lucifer have come out.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.540]  That's getting a lot of traction.
[00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:51.481]  We'll talk about that more coming up.
[00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:59.365]  But first, I want to get to the type of civil war we're already in and what it's probably going to degenerate into if we don't do XYZ.
[00:13:59.746 --> 00:14:00.426]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:01.487]  NewsWars.com.
[00:14:01.587 --> 00:14:02.307]  Band on video.
[00:14:04.568 --> 00:14:05.429]  All right, my friends.
[00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:22.515]  When you study history, you look back at all the huge wars, and the hundreds of millions dead, and the horrible, corrupt, evil groups that would rise up and try to take power, and who would then burn across the planet's surface like a plague of locusts, and then finally would be met.
[00:14:23.816 --> 00:14:25.437]  And then you'd have a new golden age.
[00:14:25.558 --> 00:14:29.821]  Once people had faced down evil again, they would get back to God, get back to morality.
[00:14:30.942 --> 00:14:32.724]  They'd try to change the world.
[00:14:36.857 --> 00:14:58.507]  And now here we are as a civilization and as a society, and we see all the classical evil growing up all around us, openly coming for our children, openly coming for our birthrights, openly telling us that they serve the devil.
[00:15:02.654 --> 00:15:11.941]  You know, I don't normally air a report twice in a row, but at the end of the Sunday show, I aired a special report that Paul Watson has tweeted out.
[00:15:12.221 --> 00:15:17.485]  Some of the greatest battles will be fought within the silent chambers of your own soul.
[00:15:18.345 --> 00:15:21.948]  Ezra Taft Benson learned who sold their soul to Satan.
[00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:25.070]  Very important report I put out.
[00:15:26.371 --> 00:15:30.234]  And that ties together with this tweet from 2006 by Jack
[00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:35.790]  From Twitter.
[00:15:39.193 --> 00:15:46.698]  Making the good pasta, reading through some amazing parts of the satanic verses, the golden threads begin to intertwine.
[00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:48.720]  How beautiful.
[00:15:51.022 --> 00:15:51.942]  Sweet, sweet Satan.
[00:15:56.626 --> 00:15:57.206]  Jack Dorsey.
[00:15:59.608 --> 00:16:00.589]  They sold their soul.
[00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:03.510]  Because they would carry out evil.
[00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.432]  They always tell you they're the good guys.
[00:16:05.472 --> 00:16:06.532]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:16:08.974 --> 00:16:11.156]  We're gonna open the phones up throughout the broadcast after that.
[00:16:12.557 --> 00:16:16.941]  But let's play Governor Weld, just last week, saying Trump's guilty of treason.
[00:16:17.241 --> 00:16:18.922]  Turns out all this is made up, but they don't care.
[00:16:18.942 --> 00:16:19.963]  They've got their impeachment going.
[00:16:20.163 --> 00:16:24.347]  They say they'll find something, no matter how much corruption they're involved in.
[00:16:24.387 --> 00:16:28.490]  It's always about the people trying to get the country back under their control.
[00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:31.813]  When the left doesn't just not care about America, they hate it.
[00:16:32.995 --> 00:16:34.157]  And they hate the unborn.
[00:16:35.199 --> 00:16:36.981]  But they're the moral authority because they said so.
[00:16:38.704 --> 00:16:39.525]  So here's Governor Weld.
[00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:49.037]  He called up the president of Ukraine and pressed him eight times to investigate Joe Biden, who the president thinks is going to be running against him.
[00:16:49.418 --> 00:16:54.602]  Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S.
[00:16:54.682 --> 00:16:55.162]  election.
[00:16:55.663 --> 00:16:56.703]  It couldn't be clearer.
[00:16:56.763 --> 00:16:59.806]  And that's not just undermining democratic institutions.
[00:17:00.406 --> 00:17:01.367]  That is treason.
[00:17:01.707 --> 00:17:03.269]  It's treason, pure and simple.
[00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:05.831]  And the penalty for treason under the U.S.
[00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:06.971]  Code is death.
[00:17:07.392 --> 00:17:08.372]  That's the only penalty.
[00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:14.485]  So Trump said in that speech to the diplomats on Friday, to the U.S.
[00:17:14.505 --> 00:17:21.830]  diplomats at the U.N., it was surreptitiously filmed, you know, in the past, you know how we dealt with people engaged in treason.
[00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:22.510]  This is crazy.
[00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.312]  And they're openly working against the country.
[00:17:24.512 --> 00:17:25.412]  That's what globalists are.
[00:17:26.373 --> 00:17:28.294]  And against the person, the people elected.
[00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:33.017]  And Schiff's putting out fake transcripts and reading them like they're real.
[00:17:33.057 --> 00:17:33.978]  And Trump's right.
[00:17:33.998 --> 00:17:34.898]  He needs to be impeached.
[00:17:35.479 --> 00:17:37.160]  Schiff is the one engaged in treason.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.402]  Trying to overthrow our elected system.
[00:17:42.865 --> 00:17:50.375]  But remember what Mudd said, a protege of Mueller, from the CIA brought over to the FBI.
[00:17:52.118 --> 00:17:54.661]  The intelligence community is going to kill this guy.
[00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:55.822]  Talking about Trump, here it is.
[00:17:57.218 --> 00:18:00.460]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.581]  He defends Vladimir Putin.
[00:18:02.621 --> 00:18:05.242]  Their State Department and CIA offers are coming home.
[00:18:05.342 --> 00:18:09.464]  And at Langley and in Foggy Bottom, CIA and State, they're saying, this is how you defend us?
[00:18:11.405 --> 00:18:12.806]  Government's gonna kill this guy.
[00:18:15.393 --> 00:18:16.293]  See, they're the government.
[00:18:16.313 --> 00:18:18.895]  That's what Tucker Carlson rightfully said in a piece Friday.
[00:18:19.475 --> 00:18:21.796]  That the bureaucracy thinks it's the government.
[00:18:21.836 --> 00:18:23.357]  And they don't care how you elect.
[00:18:23.697 --> 00:18:27.238]  They've been overthrowing all these other foreign countries, starting all these wars so long.
[00:18:27.578 --> 00:18:28.859]  Trump says, hey, we're not doing that anymore.
[00:18:28.879 --> 00:18:30.880]  And they say, you know what, we'll overthrow you.
[00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:35.322]  Because they've been the ones parlaying and selling the country out.
[00:18:35.342 --> 00:18:40.724]  Remember, just like Schumer said when President Trump was about to be inaugurated.
[00:18:40.764 --> 00:18:42.505]  This was two days before Trump got inaugurated.
[00:18:43.673 --> 00:18:48.377]  He's taking these shots, this antagonism, this taunting to the intelligence community.
[00:18:48.397 --> 00:18:53.440]  Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:18:54.001 --> 00:18:59.445]  So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[00:18:59.665 --> 00:19:02.386]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were murdered?
[00:19:02.406 --> 00:19:09.149]  I don't know, but from what I am told, they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.
[00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:11.370]  And we need the intelligence community.
[00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.291]  We don't know what's... Look at the Russian hacking!
[00:19:14.144 --> 00:19:17.346]  Without the intelligence community, we wouldn't have discovered.
[00:19:17.826 --> 00:19:25.790]  The intelligence community we have has been brokering and selling this country out for 50 years and shipping narcotics in and covering up giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:26.611]  It's all coming out.
[00:19:27.011 --> 00:19:32.054]  The intelligence community is a bunch of blue-blood leftist and globalist that hate this nation.
[00:19:33.875 --> 00:19:35.696]  The same sickos that run England.
[00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:39.354]  Here's Trump, Saturday, telling it like it is.
[00:19:39.394 --> 00:19:42.178]  They're coming after me, he says, because I'm representing you.
[00:19:42.479 --> 00:19:44.342]  And Trump's betting on you and believes on you.
[00:19:44.402 --> 00:19:44.763]  Here it is.
[00:19:46.087 --> 00:19:51.568]  What's going on now is the single greatest scam in the history of American politics.
[00:19:52.048 --> 00:19:54.449]  The Democrats want to take away your guns.
[00:19:54.849 --> 00:19:56.529]  They want to take away your health care.
[00:19:56.889 --> 00:19:58.289]  They want to take away your vote.
[00:19:58.349 --> 00:19:59.750]  They want to take away your freedom.
[00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.390]  They want to take away your judges.
[00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.450]  They want to take away everything.
[00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.151]  We can never let this happen.
[00:20:05.611 --> 00:20:09.131]  We're fighting to drain the swamp, and that's exactly what I'm doing.
[00:20:09.512 --> 00:20:11.272]  And you see why we have to do it.
[00:20:11.792 --> 00:20:15.216]  Because our country is at stake, like never before.
[00:20:15.576 --> 00:20:16.577]  It's all very simple.
[00:20:17.298 --> 00:20:20.561]  They're trying to stop me, because I'm fighting for you.
[00:20:21.222 --> 00:20:22.543]  And I'll never let that happen.
[00:20:23.624 --> 00:20:24.865]  Now, let's expand on that.
[00:20:24.985 --> 00:20:32.113]  If you read the emails Trump's sending out, or get the text messages he's sending out, people that sign up for the alerts on the campaign site, it sounds like InfoWars.
[00:20:32.133 --> 00:20:34.755]  If you listen to Rush Limbaugh, it sounds like InfoWars.
[00:20:35.711 --> 00:20:38.693]  But it's not that Trump or Limbaugh are plagiarizing what I'm saying.
[00:20:39.213 --> 00:20:41.235]  Historically, this is what's really happening.
[00:20:42.055 --> 00:20:43.196]  And now it's all out in the open.
[00:20:43.236 --> 00:20:43.857]  It's not debated.
[00:20:45.177 --> 00:20:49.140]  So yes, it's great that Trump's raising $15, $20 million a week.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:49.801]  That's wonderful.
[00:20:50.001 --> 00:20:51.282]  But what we need is courage.
[00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:53.823]  And what we need is action in Congress.
[00:20:53.843 --> 00:21:03.210]  And what we need is to go out to all the Democrat events and legally and lawfully, but loudly and sternly, bring up real issues of their criminal activity and their treason.
[00:21:04.335 --> 00:21:04.395]  And
[00:21:25.401 --> 00:21:25.741]  We're good to go.
[00:21:45.444 --> 00:21:47.426]  And I count that as the toothpaste.
[00:21:47.466 --> 00:21:57.116]  It's fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, all the great fish oil and krill oil, TurboForce, BrainForce, so many amazing products.
[00:21:57.717 --> 00:22:02.201]  The Lung Cleanze, we've got so many things that are great there.
[00:22:02.261 --> 00:22:04.644]  And when you sign up for AutoShip, you can cancel anytime for free.
[00:22:04.764 --> 00:22:06.706]  One click, you get an additional 10% off on
[00:22:08.287 --> 00:22:08.908]  The next order.
[00:22:09.408 --> 00:22:12.791]  So please realize that we are standing up to the globalists.
[00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:13.691]  We're not backing down.
[00:22:14.232 --> 00:22:18.735]  But if you don't buy the products steadfastly, we won't be able to run this operation.
[00:22:18.755 --> 00:22:20.576]  So we need more support now than ever.
[00:22:20.636 --> 00:22:21.397]  It's so critical.
[00:22:21.657 --> 00:22:23.398]  Just like the country is in crisis.
[00:22:23.979 --> 00:22:25.760]  Infowars mirrors that just exactly.
[00:22:26.421 --> 00:22:27.501]  Our ideology is winning.
[00:22:27.882 --> 00:22:28.482]  It's popular.
[00:22:28.522 --> 00:22:30.444]  But because of that, we're under attack.
[00:22:31.124 --> 00:22:32.045]  We're fighting for you.
[00:22:32.405 --> 00:22:33.286]  But I need you to step up.
[00:22:34.741 --> 00:22:39.004]  The head of Twitter talked about the beautiful threads of the satanic verses.
[00:22:39.865 --> 00:22:47.131]  He was talking about Salman Rushdie's book, but it is passages, reportedly, inspired by Satan.
[00:22:48.109 --> 00:22:49.110]  This is par for the course.
[00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.151]  These people are looking for dark power.
[00:22:51.832 --> 00:23:08.744]  Here's a special report I filed yesterday, then I'm going to hit the latest breaking news next segment, and then give the number out to take your calls about what do we do about this push for civil war to overturn the 2016 election and then cause a race and culture war so vicious and violent that the globalists finally conquer this country.
[00:23:09.364 --> 00:23:12.707]  This is the most important point in our history since July 4, 1776.
[00:23:30.096 --> 00:23:34.238]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:23:35.219 --> 00:23:36.139]  There is a saying.
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.701]  No one knows who first coined it.
[00:23:38.721 --> 00:23:40.542]  It's been around for thousands of years.
[00:23:41.182 --> 00:23:42.163]  But it goes like this.
[00:23:43.063 --> 00:23:45.125]  The devil's greatest trick
[00:23:46.015 --> 00:23:46.175]  I think?
[00:24:05.691 --> 00:24:14.096]  But then I began to notice when I was going to college that a lot of the professors teaching that, when I went and looked them up, were actually into the occult.
[00:24:14.876 --> 00:24:28.724]  There's a lot of examples of this, but there was a professor at the University of Texas who was the head of the biology department, Dr. Eric Pianka, and he said on his own website that he was a druid practitioner and believed in the occult.
[00:24:29.761 --> 00:24:37.588]  And was even on the UT website, him dressed up as an occultist that's in my film, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement, that I made 12 years ago.
[00:24:38.749 --> 00:24:40.291]  He wants global depopulation.
[00:24:40.331 --> 00:24:42.533]  He thinks humans are inherently just bad.
[00:24:43.233 --> 00:24:44.414]  And he believes in the spirit world.
[00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:47.937]  But if you go back to what he would teach in class, we're just machines.
[00:24:47.957 --> 00:24:48.558]  There is no God.
[00:24:48.598 --> 00:24:49.259]  There is no devil.
[00:24:49.479 --> 00:24:55.845]  The truth is, examples of the establishment and the left's obsession with the occult and straight-up devil worship
[00:24:56.425 --> 00:25:00.246]  is historically all over the place and happening now, every day.
[00:25:00.606 --> 00:25:17.311]  In fact, just this weekend in Portland, Antifa had a city-sponsored event that the mayor supports, where they came out and did black magic rituals against the Patriot Prayer March that's happened there the last few years, trying to exercise it and keep it from even taking place in the city.
[00:25:18.232 --> 00:25:22.075]  If you agree with me, if you agree, repeat after me.
[00:25:22.275 --> 00:25:23.136]  Hail Satan!
[00:25:23.276 --> 00:25:24.317]  Hail Satan!
[00:25:24.378 --> 00:25:27.240]  Hail Satan!
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.084]  Hail Satan!
[00:25:31.244 --> 00:25:32.205]  Hail Satan!
[00:25:32.806 --> 00:25:37.550]  The French Revolution itself was occultic, luciferian, satanic.
[00:25:37.791 --> 00:25:39.833]  It was the left-hand path.
[00:25:40.543 --> 00:25:44.384]  Which means the sinister side following the devil.
[00:25:45.165 --> 00:25:50.787]  It didn't just want to overthrow the church and the royalty, it wanted to overthrow the family itself.
[00:25:51.287 --> 00:25:52.947]  And it wanted to target children.
[00:25:53.568 --> 00:26:07.693]  If you go back thousands of years ago, all across the Middle East, all across Africa, all across what's Western Europe today, or Mesoamerica, human sacrifice of women and children, virgins demanded by these dark, wicked gods.
[00:26:08.598 --> 00:26:22.309]  Bob Dylan, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, almost every quote pop or rock star that you see making the top of the charts will tell you they made a deal with the literal devil in this world for success.
[00:26:22.589 --> 00:26:24.791]  Well, it goes back to the destiny thing.
[00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:32.817]  I made a bargain with it, you know, a long time ago and I'm holding up my hand.
[00:26:33.037 --> 00:26:33.918]  What was your bargain?
[00:26:34.418 --> 00:26:35.039]  To get where?
[00:26:38.574 --> 00:26:42.717]  Should I ask who you made the bargain with?
[00:26:42.757 --> 00:26:45.459]  With the chief commander.
[00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:46.620]  On this earth?
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.583]  On this earth and in a world we can't see.
[00:26:51.183 --> 00:27:02.131]  Bob Dylan told 60 Minutes and other national TV programs that he was given magical enlightenment by the devil himself to be able to come up with the rhymes and the music that he developed.
[00:27:02.631 --> 00:27:10.376]  And all of it when he went to the crossroads in the South, where his idol admitted that he himself had sold his soul to the devil.
[00:27:10.717 --> 00:27:13.439]  That's when I went to the crossroads and made a big deal.
[00:27:14.119 --> 00:27:18.622]  You know, like... Yeah.
[00:27:19.123 --> 00:27:19.643]  One night.
[00:27:19.903 --> 00:27:25.127]  And then I went back to Minneapolis and I was like, hey, where's this guy been?
[00:27:26.545 --> 00:27:27.605]  He went to the crossroads.
[00:27:28.166 --> 00:27:42.131]  If I even tried to scratch the surface in this report of not just top musicians, but top entertainers, movie stars, scientists, world leaders, saying that they owe their success to the devil, this would be a 10-hour report.
[00:27:42.771 --> 00:27:56.181]  Just this week, Eddie Murphy came out in an interview with Jerry Seinfeld on the program Comedians and Cards and Coffee, and talked about Sammy Davis Jr., who was serious as the devil, saying he owed his allegiance to Satan.
[00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:58.042]  Sammy told me he worshiped the devil.
[00:27:58.162 --> 00:28:03.206]  We were in, uh, Dan Tana's on that restaurant with all the pictures of him.
[00:28:03.246 --> 00:28:06.148]  Sammy was like, you know, Satan is as powerful as God.
[00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:10.492]  Mae West, Charlie Manson, and countless others
[00:28:11.232 --> 00:28:14.093]  Believe they were following the directives of Satan.
[00:28:14.554 --> 00:28:36.744]  The Bohemian Grove in Northern California admits in their own internal annals that I got from a member's widow that they are recreating Faust-type rituals in the Redwoods that they are mimicking from ancient German satanic death cults, going back directly to Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Illuminati.
[00:28:37.484 --> 00:28:45.649]  Skull and Bones in New Haven, Connecticut initiates the sons and daughters of powerful elites into what can only be called a satanic religion.
[00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:47.330]  Now to the heart of the matter.
[00:28:48.571 --> 00:28:58.738]  I personally have been offered by these power networks to join them if I will join with Lucifer and be given incredible power in the world government system.
[00:28:59.608 --> 00:29:03.892]  I've been offered this for more than 25 years, and I've always said no.
[00:29:04.732 --> 00:29:09.676]  Mark Dice was offered a national TV program with some household names.
[00:29:10.397 --> 00:29:14.640]  But first, they asked him to pledge himself to Lucifer.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.362]  So I take you back full circle.
[00:29:17.783 --> 00:29:20.927]  The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[00:29:21.487 --> 00:29:24.531]  The entire power structure of the world is satanic.
[00:29:25.012 --> 00:29:28.075]  They now admit they're keeping babies alive and harvesting their organs.
[00:29:28.376 --> 00:29:31.680]  Human-animal clones have been created for more than 30 years.
[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.682]  They're just now admitting it to the public.
[00:29:34.503 --> 00:29:49.402]  This world government system is targeting Christians by design and creating a world cashless society or world social score where conservatives, nationalists, Christians and others who won't allow their children to be indoctrinated into the world government system.
[00:29:50.322 --> 00:29:53.406]  Will be targeted and their right to buy and sell taken away.
[00:29:54.067 --> 00:29:55.849]  Prophecy is being manifest.
[00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:03.919]  In summation, there is a God that created the universe that wants us to use our free will to choose to join Him.
[00:30:04.622 --> 00:30:06.043]  But we have been given free will.
[00:30:06.143 --> 00:30:08.564]  We are the seed of the universe, as Gandhi said.
[00:30:08.664 --> 00:30:09.465]  Incredible potential.
[00:30:09.665 --> 00:30:10.626]  We're made in the image of God.
[00:30:11.006 --> 00:30:12.707]  So we can choose to go with the devil.
[00:30:13.327 --> 00:30:13.727]  It's true.
[00:30:13.787 --> 00:30:16.449]  God created the devil and has allowed the devil to be our tester.
[00:30:17.049 --> 00:30:17.870]  This is real.
[00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.551]  This entire life is only a flash.
[00:30:20.872 --> 00:30:21.652]  It's boot camp.
[00:30:22.112 --> 00:30:22.733]  It's a test.
[00:30:24.053 --> 00:30:24.414]  Faust!
[00:30:25.464 --> 00:30:32.087]  Many historians now believe it did exist, but regardless, the legend of Faust gives us the keys to understand what's happening.
[00:30:32.768 --> 00:30:35.869]  Faust could have gotten out of his deal with the devil anytime he wanted.
[00:30:36.309 --> 00:30:38.230]  The devil didn't give Faust all those skills.
[00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:41.932]  God gave Faust, and all of us, gifts.
[00:30:43.033 --> 00:30:52.077]  The devil is older than us and is able to show us some of the gifts and convince us that he gave us the gifts, so we believe we are trapped under his control.
[00:30:52.797 --> 00:30:53.658]  It's a giant fraud.
[00:30:54.522 --> 00:30:57.443]  These people that serve Satan have been deceived.
[00:30:58.024 --> 00:31:00.665]  And that's why they later learned it isn't about money and power.
[00:31:00.685 --> 00:31:03.806]  It isn't about being cool or being a great poet or an artist.
[00:31:04.486 --> 00:31:09.469]  Once the devil tricks you to become his slave, then you must carry out evil against the innocents.
[00:31:09.989 --> 00:31:14.851]  Or the devil will use his worldly power against you to bring you down.
[00:31:15.091 --> 00:31:19.333]  That's why Christ said, when I am in you, the world will hate you and will come after you.
[00:31:20.322 --> 00:31:22.224]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a test.
[00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:23.065]  This is real.
[00:31:23.325 --> 00:31:27.188]  And those of you that have served Satan can leave the devil anytime you want.
[00:31:27.408 --> 00:31:29.570]  But you've got to allow God's Spirit to come into you.
[00:31:30.051 --> 00:31:32.193]  And God doesn't do that unless you've asked God in.
[00:31:33.234 --> 00:31:34.375]  Humble yourself before God.
[00:31:34.755 --> 00:31:37.718]  Go to the quiet place, the Most High, and ask for the Holy Spirit to enter your body.
[00:31:39.775 --> 00:31:43.458]  The only thing you should fear, as one of our presidents said, is fear itself.
[00:31:43.918 --> 00:31:50.863]  You should not fear he who can take your physical body away, but he who can damn you to hell for eternity.
[00:31:51.143 --> 00:31:52.484]  Don't make the wrong choice.
[00:31:53.465 --> 00:31:54.186]  Renounce Satan.
[00:31:54.706 --> 00:31:55.366]  Join Christ.
[00:31:55.827 --> 00:31:57.868]  The devil's real, but Christ is real.
[00:31:58.449 --> 00:32:00.330]  You're real, and your free will is real.
[00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.632]  Make the right decision, and join God.
[00:32:04.994 --> 00:32:13.458]  There is a lot more at stake, ladies and gentlemen, than just the United States or just Christians.
[00:32:14.879 --> 00:32:21.643]  The entire future of the planet and our trajectory into the future is being decided.
[00:32:21.763 --> 00:32:23.544]  I'm a very empathic person.
[00:32:24.568 --> 00:32:36.671]  I pick up on people's emotions, energy, and I undoubtedly have the touch, as everyone has, but I've got a particular touch too much.
[00:32:37.691 --> 00:32:44.193]  And I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the energy level on the planet right now is explosive.
[00:32:44.353 --> 00:32:47.554]  I've never felt anything like it.
[00:32:50.663 --> 00:32:52.144]  It's hard for me to even be on air.
[00:32:52.984 --> 00:32:56.046]  And I can tell you, the deep state is making their move on Trump.
[00:32:57.427 --> 00:32:58.828]  This is 100% real.
[00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:04.752]  And if they're unable to remove him, they're going to try to assassinate the president.
[00:33:05.192 --> 00:33:07.193]  I guarantee you they're trying to poison his food.
[00:33:09.474 --> 00:33:10.755]  Trump feeds off this.
[00:33:11.416 --> 00:33:12.576]  He's very, very excited.
[00:33:12.596 --> 00:33:16.879]  He realizes he's living in a real action-adventure movie.
[00:33:18.843 --> 00:33:19.583]  I'm very similar.
[00:33:19.603 --> 00:33:21.443]  I know a lot of you are similar.
[00:33:25.364 --> 00:33:33.666]  But we now have Democrats and Republicans saying it feels like a 1776 kind of fight.
[00:33:33.786 --> 00:33:35.006]  We'll tell you about that more coming up.
[00:33:37.826 --> 00:33:38.967]  But that's what this is.
[00:33:39.047 --> 00:33:44.428]  And so you notice every talking point, everything we say, it's as if it magically all became reality.
[00:33:44.768 --> 00:33:46.028]  It didn't become reality.
[00:33:46.966 --> 00:33:50.107]  It was already reality right below the surface!
[00:33:53.209 --> 00:33:56.210]  I just put on my mask and snorkel and dive down a little bit.
[00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:00.672]  And let me tell you, the deeper you get, the worse it gets.
[00:34:01.172 --> 00:34:02.373]  And I want to point something out.
[00:34:02.453 --> 00:34:08.815]  The people trying to conquer our civilization, from the top to the bottom, are the scum of the earth.
[00:34:09.436 --> 00:34:11.657]  The most nasty, evil people you can imagine.
[00:34:11.917 --> 00:34:14.398]  When you watch Antifa across the United States,
[00:34:16.033 --> 00:34:19.075]  Attack women, children, old people in wheelchairs.
[00:34:20.176 --> 00:34:21.517]  You think they have no chivalry?
[00:34:22.298 --> 00:34:23.059]  What's wrong with them?
[00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:27.702]  Why do they do things that to any normal person is the most outrageous thing you could do?
[00:34:28.202 --> 00:34:30.044]  Because they're into killing babies!
[00:34:30.124 --> 00:34:31.625]  They're into killing them after they're born!
[00:34:32.045 --> 00:34:35.088]  They're almost all on hardcore drugs and into the occult!
[00:34:37.029 --> 00:34:40.372]  They are the servants of Satan!
[00:34:44.514 --> 00:34:49.675]  We're gonna show you a four-minute compilation of Antifa being mean to men, women, and children, and old people.
[00:34:51.016 --> 00:34:52.816]  There's a new video by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:34:52.836 --> 00:34:55.857]  He's got an article about it on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:34:55.897 --> 00:34:56.797]  It needs to go viral.
[00:34:56.817 --> 00:34:58.758]  People need to see this video.
[00:34:58.898 --> 00:35:02.679]  Antifa protesters scream and block elderly woman.
[00:35:03.559 --> 00:35:12.622]  They're simply going across the street, and there's all these other people walking across, but the Antifa targets a woman that looks like she's at least 85 years old.
[00:35:15.851 --> 00:35:21.114]  If I had to do an analysis, it looks like it's either her son or younger brother taking care of her.
[00:35:21.134 --> 00:35:24.456]  You know, we've all seen the older son taking care of the elderly mother.
[00:35:26.918 --> 00:35:29.419]  But all the body language, everything is, that's his mother.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.882]  And scum of the earth in mass come over and scream and yell at her.
[00:35:34.122 --> 00:35:37.624]  She's obviously pretty much deaf, can't even hear what they're saying.
[00:35:38.705 --> 00:35:40.246]  She just keeps trying to move across the street.
[00:35:40.846 --> 00:35:43.488]  But like wolves that pick out a hurt lamb,
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:45.921]  They go for her.
[00:35:46.481 --> 00:35:51.584]  We've got footage of this where we'll be out in Antifa, we'll go over to some old guy on a walker.
[00:35:52.125 --> 00:35:54.927]  We've got footage of this and start knocking him into traffic.
[00:35:55.487 --> 00:35:57.228]  You go, why would you target the weak?
[00:35:57.328 --> 00:36:01.231]  See, if I was gonna fight somebody who was the enemy, I'd take out their strongest person first.
[00:36:01.251 --> 00:36:01.951]  That's my instinct.
[00:36:02.111 --> 00:36:03.352]  I'd go for the biggest, meanest guy.
[00:36:03.632 --> 00:36:05.273]  I'd go for whoever was supposedly in charge.
[00:36:06.454 --> 00:36:07.455]  That's instinctive.
[00:36:07.735 --> 00:36:09.516]  Well, for them, they go after the weakest.
[00:36:09.556 --> 00:36:10.197]  It's what they do.
[00:36:10.217 --> 00:36:11.317]  The children.
[00:36:11.578 --> 00:36:12.018]  The old.
[00:36:14.445 --> 00:36:15.245]  And look at these articles.
[00:36:16.566 --> 00:36:24.430]  Netflix movie depicts futuristic Antifa that time travels back to kill Trump supporters in the year 2000 to stop world government from being defeated.
[00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:25.811]  You actually have to read this!
[00:36:25.871 --> 00:36:26.611]  The show's out!
[00:36:27.032 --> 00:36:27.672]  It's unbelievable!
[00:36:29.013 --> 00:36:39.218]  ADL says Antifa are wonderful people and anyone criticizing them is basically a Nazi and that any Antifa anti-images are hate symbols.
[00:36:39.538 --> 00:36:42.920]  How sick of the Anti-Defamation League.
[00:36:45.558 --> 00:36:53.384]  The truth is Antifa is an anti-American, globalist, Maoist organization that again is the scum of the earth and is anti-free speech.
[00:36:53.985 --> 00:36:57.187]  Let's go ahead and roll a four-minute compilation of this.
[00:36:57.507 --> 00:36:58.748]  For radio listeners, I'll narrate.
[00:36:58.969 --> 00:37:07.735]  Here is the old woman just yesterday in Canada as she tries to walk across the street.
[00:37:07.775 --> 00:37:08.136]  Here it is.
[00:37:10.405 --> 00:37:12.506]  Off our streets, Nazi scum!
[00:37:12.906 --> 00:37:14.846]  Off our streets, Nazi scum!
[00:37:14.886 --> 00:37:17.707]  Off our streets, Nazi scum!
[00:37:17.747 --> 00:37:18.287]  Now, now, now.
[00:37:18.347 --> 00:37:19.308]  Hit pause and back this back up.
[00:37:19.328 --> 00:37:20.068]  We're going to play it again.
[00:37:20.328 --> 00:37:20.748]  From the start.
[00:37:21.288 --> 00:37:21.989]  The whole compilation.
[00:37:23.629 --> 00:37:27.250]  They just pick old white people and think, you must be Nazi scum.
[00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.311]  They're not wearing any identifying stuff.
[00:37:29.631 --> 00:37:30.811]  She's wearing baby blue.
[00:37:31.251 --> 00:37:32.152]  She's on a walker.
[00:37:32.692 --> 00:37:36.373]  These people are so cowardly, ooh, I can scare an old woman.
[00:37:37.608 --> 00:37:41.851]  They leave big men, women, people walking across the busy city street alone.
[00:37:42.251 --> 00:37:45.133]  They swarm a woman on a walker.
[00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:53.218]  And look, I'm not being Mr. Tough Guy, but I mean, you gotta hand it to this guy for not decking him.
[00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:56.019]  But that's what they're paid to do is to start a riot.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.462]  Let's go back to the scum of the earth, who the media says are heroes.
[00:37:59.502 --> 00:37:59.842]  Here they are.
[00:38:01.964 --> 00:38:03.505]  Blocking her walker.
[00:38:03.585 --> 00:38:05.406]  Bumping up against him.
[00:38:24.031 --> 00:38:24.651]  I can't hear you.
[00:38:24.891 --> 00:38:26.272]  You're a f***ing anti-American!
[00:38:26.732 --> 00:38:28.013]  I'm an anti-American?
[00:38:28.233 --> 00:38:29.694]  You stupid bastard!
[00:38:30.294 --> 00:38:31.754]  I'm a f***ing patriot!
[00:38:33.635 --> 00:38:35.536]  I think we should classify them as a gang.
[00:38:36.236 --> 00:38:41.299]  You know, they come dressed in uniforms, they have weapons, they're almost a militia.
[00:38:42.179 --> 00:38:45.400]  I think we need to think about that in terms of our law enforcement approach.
[00:38:45.621 --> 00:38:48.322]  We condemn in the strongest possible terms
[00:38:49.693 --> 00:38:54.655]  This egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.
[00:38:55.355 --> 00:38:56.055]  On many sides.
[00:38:56.796 --> 00:38:58.977]  Wait, on many sides?
[00:38:59.557 --> 00:39:01.938]  This was a white nationalist rally.
[00:39:01.978 --> 00:39:03.878]  You have to call that out by name.
[00:39:03.999 --> 00:39:04.699]  Many sides?
[00:39:08.257 --> 00:39:12.518]  Mr. President, Mr. President, this is terrorism, not your order at KFC.
[00:39:12.818 --> 00:39:17.819]  Prior to the unrest, police banned sticks, masks, and any other potential weapons.
[00:39:17.859 --> 00:39:21.000]  However, dozens of anti-fascist protesters broke those rules, it appears.
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.840]  They also pepper-sprayed the leader of the conservative group.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:30.101]  One left-wing demonstrator attacked a photographer, and others reportedly threatened people who were trying to film the violence.
[00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:34.562]  What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?
[00:39:35.002 --> 00:39:37.703]  Do they have any semblance of guilt?
[00:39:38.503 --> 00:39:40.904]  Let me ask you this.
[00:39:40.944 --> 00:39:45.467]  What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs?
[00:39:46.027 --> 00:39:48.048]  Do they have any problem?
[00:39:48.108 --> 00:39:48.788]  I think they do.
[00:39:48.948 --> 00:40:02.215]  And they are just beating people, ganging up, men and women, ganging up on lone individuals and just beating them in a wanton, savage, brown shirt, Nazi operation.
[00:40:02.295 --> 00:40:10.240]  They don't want to mention Antifa and how Antifa literally came trained, militarized, doing war-like maneuvers.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.402]  You know, they bring coolers and you think, oh, it's to stay hydrated.
[00:40:14.502 --> 00:40:20.706]  No, it's filled with water balloons, filled with feces, urine, just disgusting things that will pop and explode on people.
[00:40:21.026 --> 00:40:23.347]  And water bottles filled with the same substances.
[00:40:23.568 --> 00:40:25.008]  I don't like being filmed!
[00:40:33.115 --> 00:40:35.277]  Yeah, he just got struck with pepper spray.
[00:40:36.999 --> 00:40:39.021]  By some irrational... Is the liberal helping him?
[00:40:39.341 --> 00:40:40.102]  When I don't like this?
[00:40:40.262 --> 00:40:42.544]  No, you see, the guy that attacked him is not a liberal.
[00:40:42.564 --> 00:40:43.345]  He's a Marxist.
[00:40:43.525 --> 00:40:47.509]  Every time one of these situations happens, you know, you see the worst of people sometimes.
[00:40:47.549 --> 00:40:48.770]  I think we saw it out of the left.
[00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:55.092]  You just saw those videos of them chasing and beating people, people in black clothing, black masks.
[00:40:55.232 --> 00:40:58.853]  Over a hundred of them broke through the lines and attacked stragglers who were there.
[00:40:58.873 --> 00:41:01.033]  For the most part, the event was shut down.
[00:41:01.113 --> 00:41:09.316]  Now, what the media's done, and we take the bait every time, is focused on Charlottesville, where they also funded the white supremacist the left did to create the clash.
[00:41:09.756 --> 00:41:17.198]  We're going to put a report out at the end of the show today where I'm going to show you what happened in San Francisco when they just attacked families at the park.
[00:41:18.118 --> 00:41:22.781]  And all the other attacks around the country that they don't want you to see, you see.
[00:41:23.101 --> 00:41:24.362]  But that's why I decided to show you that.
[00:41:24.402 --> 00:41:25.823]  Charlottesville is coming up.
[00:41:25.843 --> 00:41:29.805]  We're going to show you what they're really doing all over the country and how they're carrying it out.
[00:41:30.485 --> 00:41:31.226]  Please stay with us.
[00:41:31.626 --> 00:41:32.647]  We're going to give the number out.
[00:41:32.667 --> 00:41:33.707]  We're going to take your calls.
[00:41:34.007 --> 00:41:35.188]  We're already in a civil war.
[00:41:35.228 --> 00:41:36.389]  They want a violent civil war.
[00:41:36.669 --> 00:41:38.030]  They intend to impeach the president.
[00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:39.971]  They're openly saying they want to kill him.
[00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:41.511]  That's Democrats.
[00:41:41.631 --> 00:41:43.292]  That's CFR members.
[00:41:43.312 --> 00:41:45.093]  That's the governor of Massachusetts.
[00:41:45.633 --> 00:41:46.833]  That's who these people are.
[00:41:46.953 --> 00:41:48.374]  What are we going to do about it?
[00:41:48.874 --> 00:41:49.514]  Because it's here.
[00:41:49.554 --> 00:41:52.956]  They're making their move because Trump's really trying to clean up the swamp.
[00:41:53.176 --> 00:41:55.697]  He's really going after the corruption and they don't know what to do.
[00:41:57.017 --> 00:41:58.058]  Trump's betting on America.
[00:41:58.178 --> 00:41:58.998]  I'm betting on America.
[00:41:59.058 --> 00:42:00.118]  Are you betting on America?
[00:42:00.458 --> 00:42:01.399]  We don't have a choice now.
[00:42:02.259 --> 00:42:03.059]  They're going for broke.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:03.660]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.100]  Stay with us.
[00:42:05.984 --> 00:42:18.273]  Well, I'm trying to not just explode in spontaneous combustion here because the energy level, the good and evil that's rising right now on this planet is just palpable.
[00:42:19.594 --> 00:42:24.398]  We're going to go over all the attempts to impeach the president, the game plan, and then I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:42:24.438 --> 00:42:25.718]  How do you think we stop this?
[00:42:25.779 --> 00:42:31.543]  What do we do to not just be spectators, but to take action and say no to this whole operation?
[00:42:32.585 --> 00:42:33.245]  It's all coming up.
[00:42:33.885 --> 00:42:34.946]  A toll-free number to join us.
[00:42:35.106 --> 00:42:36.686]  First-time callers in the first round.
[00:42:36.706 --> 00:42:37.487]  877-789-2539.
[00:42:38.367 --> 00:42:41.928]  If you called in, never got on, we'd love to hear from you.
[00:42:41.968 --> 00:42:43.469]  That counts as first-time caller as well.
[00:42:43.489 --> 00:42:43.649]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:42:43.669 --> 00:42:43.729]  877-789-2539.
[00:42:43.769 --> 00:42:46.090]  But first off, let's play this important special report.
[00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:56.512]  We could not ignore what the president did.
[00:42:56.812 --> 00:42:58.054]  He gave us no choice.
[00:42:58.555 --> 00:43:00.317]  So it wasn't any change of mind.
[00:43:00.858 --> 00:43:04.743]  I always said, we will follow the facts where they take us.
[00:43:04.984 --> 00:43:06.385]  They just prepared this lie.
[00:43:06.426 --> 00:43:10.912]  That's why Pelosi went ahead with the impeachment press conference before she ever read the transcript.
[00:43:12.188 --> 00:43:13.629]  The two are night and day different.
[00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:15.891]  The president did absolutely nothing wrong.
[00:43:16.251 --> 00:43:17.672]  We can never let this happen.
[00:43:18.133 --> 00:43:21.635]  We're fighting to drain the swamp, and that's exactly what I'm doing.
[00:43:22.036 --> 00:43:23.817]  And you see why we have to do it.
[00:43:24.297 --> 00:43:27.720]  Because our country is at stake, like never before.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:34.105]  We've got Obama on the stage with the Russian Prime Minister Medvedev, remember, saying, oh, after the election, I can do a lot more.
[00:43:34.125 --> 00:43:36.106]  This is my last election, yeah.
[00:43:36.126 --> 00:43:37.207]  And after my election, I have more flexibility.
[00:43:44.661 --> 00:43:45.122]  Well guess what?
[00:43:45.162 --> 00:43:46.343]  That's not an impeachable offense.
[00:43:47.444 --> 00:43:49.266]  The president is the executive branch.
[00:43:49.327 --> 00:43:54.893]  He's allowed to make deals with foreign powers as long as they're not selling the country out.
[00:43:55.888 --> 00:44:04.090]  The Chinese communists have bought this nation off, and the Russians bought off Hillary to a great extent with the Uranium One and so many other issues.
[00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:07.551]  I mean, Trump is the stalwart for this nation.
[00:44:08.111 --> 00:44:11.772]  And then Paul Krugman comes out from the New York Times and says, soon we'll all be in FEMA camps.
[00:44:12.712 --> 00:44:14.152]  Trump's going to put journalists in camps.
[00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:18.353]  It's Obama went after the whistleblowers, and Obama went after the press.
[00:44:18.513 --> 00:44:21.837]  Agents monitored Rosen's movements in and out of the State Department.
[00:44:22.057 --> 00:44:26.382]  They searched his personal emails and combed through his cell phone records.
[00:44:26.542 --> 00:44:31.287]  The subpoena says James Rosen is a potential criminal because he's a reporter.
[00:44:32.128 --> 00:44:37.554]  Is the White House comfortable with that standard, never before seen, in a leak investigation?
[00:44:37.674 --> 00:44:41.495]  The investigation into Rosen has sparked a rare thing in Washington.
[00:44:41.675 --> 00:44:46.677]  Bipartisan outrage over what some are calling Obama's war on journalism.
[00:44:46.997 --> 00:44:51.959]  It's conservatives being kicked off the air, and being sued, and lied about, and arrested, and persecuted.
[00:44:52.539 --> 00:45:03.223]  And the Democratic Party, and the corporate media, and the Hollywood scum, bought and paid for by the chi-coms, who literally own the majority of six of the eight big Hollywood production firms,
[00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:23.269]  Now know that no one believes them other than their own cult followers, maybe 20% of the public, who knows it's all a lie, but goes with it because they still think they can fool somebody or they can at least disrupt the country and cause a stock market crash.
[00:45:24.209 --> 00:45:29.534]  Remember last year, Bill Maher came out and said, I want to crash the economy so that Trump doesn't win.
[00:45:29.574 --> 00:45:30.454]  He said it again this year.
[00:45:31.115 --> 00:45:34.198]  And then the private Federal Reserve raised interest rates a bunch to do that.
[00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:40.383]  I mean, we're watching groups openly try to sabotage the country at the behest of foreign powers.
[00:45:41.926 --> 00:45:51.949]  While telling us continually the president's a traitor and he's selling us out to the Russians and the Ukrainians and everybody else when he's the America first president, everybody knows it.
[00:45:52.570 --> 00:46:07.375]  Paul Krugman won a Nobel Prize for economics for supporting and pushing Obama-era type economic propaganda, which is de-industrialization of the West, screwing America over garbage.
[00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:13.300]  And then Krugman famously, of course, said that Trump would never get the growth rate up to 3%.
[00:46:13.361 --> 00:46:16.944]  Remember Obama said Trump doesn't have a magic wand, you can't do it.
[00:46:17.244 --> 00:46:18.205]  Obama could never do it.
[00:46:18.346 --> 00:46:18.906]  Trump got it up to 3.8.
[00:46:20.953 --> 00:46:35.878]  They're making their move on America right now, and they've got your kids at the public schools, they've got your money where you sent your young people to these colleges, almost all the degrees are worthless, by design, and then they promise them, oh, once the utopia takes over of communism, then you're gonna have a place in it.
[00:46:36.499 --> 00:46:45.282]  And so that's why the millennials, more than half of them are working for a communist utopia, is because they've been told that they're the ruling class by con artists like Paul Krugman.
[00:46:46.164 --> 00:46:50.025]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, September 20th, 2019.
[00:46:50.645 --> 00:46:59.708]  We're already into hour number two, and I intend, starting at the bottom of the hour for the rest of the broadcast, to take your phone calls on one big issue.
[00:47:00.768 --> 00:47:04.369]  This country's already in a cold civil war, as I've been saying for three years.
[00:47:05.444 --> 00:47:14.030]  Now the President says we're going out of a cold civil war into a hot civil war, and the Democrats are pushing that, and they're openly funded by the Communist Chinese.
[00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:15.931]  Even the Secretary General of the U.N.
[00:47:15.951 --> 00:47:20.535]  last week said, there is a world war going on between China and America.
[00:47:20.855 --> 00:47:23.617]  It's economic, it's cultural, and it's becoming military.
[00:47:24.557 --> 00:47:28.200]  Now, I've been saying that really for 20 years.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:28.740]  I've been on air 25 years.
[00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:36.613]  And I used to get Bill Gertz on from the Washington Times about China, the big threat in the future, and how the Clintons sold us out with the missile secrets.
[00:47:36.893 --> 00:47:39.974]  So we've been on it for most of the time I've been on air.
[00:47:41.835 --> 00:47:45.396]  But now it's the elephant sitting on us, not the elephant in the room.
[00:47:45.916 --> 00:47:51.018]  And that's who the Democrats can basically go to to fund whatever they want.
[00:47:51.319 --> 00:47:56.901]  And the Democrats can get investments in China that the Communist Party backs and absolutely pay them off.
[00:47:57.867 --> 00:48:00.309]  And Ukraine's been paying off Democrats and Republicans.
[00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:03.591]  And so has Russia has been using the Democrats.
[00:48:04.092 --> 00:48:06.173]  And the Democrats have been using them like a cash machine.
[00:48:07.274 --> 00:48:09.896]  And so Trump comes in and he did fire all the lobbyists.
[00:48:10.696 --> 00:48:14.779]  Now he said some of his staff secretly become lobbyists and run their own scams.
[00:48:14.879 --> 00:48:15.880]  That's been a big problem.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.763]  Because just because Trump won't do it and makes his own decisions.
[00:48:22.662 --> 00:48:25.403]  It doesn't matter because the people under him are running all sorts of scams.
[00:48:25.443 --> 00:48:28.425]  So a lot of them are bought off, a lot of them are paid off, a lot of them take money.
[00:48:28.845 --> 00:48:33.627]  Then they can be compromised and they're told, you better go in and take out Trump.
[00:48:33.907 --> 00:48:36.688]  You better find some reason or we're going to burn you and put you in prison.
[00:48:38.189 --> 00:48:45.712]  And it's because Trump's never gotten full control of the Justice Department that they're making this move right now because they've still got some of their people in there.
[00:48:45.772 --> 00:48:46.633]  But now Barr
[00:48:48.962 --> 00:48:56.126]  Has convened the grand juries, both informational and to indict, and it's confirmed that McCabe has been indicted for several months.
[00:48:57.547 --> 00:49:04.211]  And they brought the appeal to the Deputy Attorney General, that's how it works, to be able to kill that prosecution, and they said no!
[00:49:04.651 --> 00:49:12.216]  That means the prosecution is like a barracuda, just right out of vision, in the water, about to swoop in and eat the little fishy.
[00:49:12.556 --> 00:49:13.997]  That's McCabe, and McCabe has said,
[00:49:15.658 --> 00:49:18.140]  If I go down, everyone's gonna go down with me.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.022]  Well, the last person to say that was Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.
[00:49:22.143 --> 00:49:28.347]  And the Air Force colonel that did his autopsy said he'd been shot through the head by a .45, through the head.
[00:49:29.748 --> 00:49:37.493]  They had troops on board, killed everybody on board, blew the hatch, heloed, high-lowed out, crashed a plane in the mountain.
[00:49:38.334 --> 00:49:39.114]  One woman lived.
[00:49:39.514 --> 00:49:40.595]  She was really not even hurt.
[00:49:41.836 --> 00:49:44.218]  She didn't make it back until by the time the ambulance got to the base.
[00:49:46.035 --> 00:49:51.100]  They killed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown when he shot his mouth off and said, I go down, everybody goes down.
[00:49:53.583 --> 00:49:56.085]  It was the same corruption using commerce and U.S.
[00:49:56.125 --> 00:49:58.868]  government deals to line their pockets with billions of dollars.
[00:49:59.128 --> 00:50:01.591]  Hell, Bill Clinton would have Chinese generals at the White House.
[00:50:02.932 --> 00:50:03.773]  It was on C-SPAN!
[00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:09.593]  Ended up releasing the footage in plainclothes with big square briefcases.
[00:50:10.414 --> 00:50:11.935]  Somebody's got that footage, send it to us.
[00:50:12.675 --> 00:50:15.918]  I aired it years ago on AXS TV, like 22 years ago.
[00:50:16.518 --> 00:50:18.339]  And man, I got death threats when I did that.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:19.760]  It was incredible.
[00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:23.183]  I've never been able to find that footage since, but it was put on C-SPAN.
[00:50:23.243 --> 00:50:26.165]  It came out as part of the impeachment hearings.
[00:50:28.188 --> 00:50:31.870]  And they were in there with big square briefcases full of $100 bills, giving them to Bill Clinton.
[00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.231]  And he was on tape going, Oh, thanks a lot.
[00:50:34.291 --> 00:50:35.072]  I appreciate it.
[00:50:35.112 --> 00:50:37.693]  I'll take, I'm going to get you those missile secrets now.
[00:50:38.814 --> 00:50:40.855]  And so this has been ongoing for a while.
[00:50:41.375 --> 00:50:50.060]  And now Trump's in there and just looks at the numbers, makes the best decisions of what's good for industry, what's good for families, what's good for our defense, what's good for our future.
[00:50:51.301 --> 00:50:53.062]  And they're going crazy.
[00:50:54.497 --> 00:50:58.322]  So the toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:50:59.504 --> 00:51:00.486]  How bad's it gonna get?
[00:51:00.506 --> 00:51:03.450]  I mean, gut level and also just looking at it.
[00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:05.453]  The Democrats don't have a case to get Trump.
[00:51:05.673 --> 00:51:06.354]  They don't care!
[00:51:06.654 --> 00:51:09.038]  They have the votes in the House to impeach the President.
[00:51:10.626 --> 00:51:11.707]  Will the Senate remove?
[00:51:12.488 --> 00:51:14.370]  Kavanaugh barely got approved, folks.
[00:51:14.631 --> 00:51:16.793]  They're gonna have women come out and say Trump raped them.
[00:51:17.614 --> 00:51:18.896]  Kavanaugh was just a dry run of that.
[00:51:19.276 --> 00:51:26.024]  They're gonna bring out all these lawyers that work for Trump that are getting indicted for not paying their taxes or beating their wife or whatever.
[00:51:26.385 --> 00:51:29.448]  They're all being told, you come out against Trump or you're going.
[00:51:30.011 --> 00:51:30.551]  To go to jail.
[00:51:30.691 --> 00:51:33.232]  And they've got all these indictments in the Southern District ready.
[00:51:33.453 --> 00:51:35.193]  And all the indictments in Chicago ready.
[00:51:35.414 --> 00:51:36.934]  And all the indictments in D.C.
[00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:38.055]  and Maryland ready.
[00:51:38.235 --> 00:51:39.816]  And indictments in Florida ready.
[00:51:40.196 --> 00:51:41.937]  They've got all these kept prosecutors.
[00:51:42.217 --> 00:51:43.877]  And it's all just going to come out.
[00:51:45.578 --> 00:51:48.700]  During the six committees by Thanksgiving.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:49.140]  Watch.
[00:51:51.343 --> 00:51:53.384]  You see Pelosi, she's all freaked out, she's shaking.
[00:51:53.404 --> 00:51:54.605]  The Democrats are all whacked out.
[00:51:54.785 --> 00:51:58.227]  Because they're making their criminal move right now, and their hands are shaking while they do it.
[00:51:58.567 --> 00:52:05.590]  Because behind them, the Chi-coms, the globalists, the multinationals, they're saying, do whatever it takes, even if it's a civil war, we'll protect you.
[00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:07.551]  But deep down the left knows they're not going to be protected.
[00:52:09.332 --> 00:52:11.333]  This is going to be explosive.
[00:52:12.394 --> 00:52:14.635]  And hitting theaters this weekend, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:25.356]  The joker about a guy living in his mom's basement who's the leftist washed-up comedian who goes out and commits mass shootings and bombings and all the rest of it.
[00:52:25.596 --> 00:52:28.657]  And I told you, it's tailor-funded to trigger mass shootings.
[00:52:29.097 --> 00:52:39.701]  And two weeks after I did a big report on it, the Pentagon came out and said, we've got intel that there are groups planning organized mass shootings dressed as jokers.
[00:52:41.942 --> 00:52:44.403]  Antifa, folks, knows how to false flag.
[00:52:45.472 --> 00:52:47.994]  And they've got mentally ill meth heads ready to do it.
[00:52:48.094 --> 00:52:51.976]  And they're loading their social media with Trump and Alex Jones support right now.
[00:52:52.617 --> 00:52:54.638]  And they're going to march into those movie theaters.
[00:52:54.938 --> 00:52:56.619]  And they're going to gun people down.
[00:52:56.639 --> 00:52:59.742]  And they're going to blame you, the gun owner.
[00:53:00.502 --> 00:53:00.942]  It's coming.
[00:53:01.703 --> 00:53:02.063]  It's coming.
[00:53:04.124 --> 00:53:04.545]  It's coming.
[00:53:04.705 --> 00:53:07.687]  I wouldn't get anywhere near those Joker screenings.
[00:53:08.027 --> 00:53:09.608]  If you want to get shot up, go to them.
[00:53:10.329 --> 00:53:11.209]  And what did the director say?
[00:53:11.229 --> 00:53:13.391]  He said, this is a reflection of culture.
[00:53:13.451 --> 00:53:15.092]  I don't apologize for whatever it does.
[00:53:16.664 --> 00:53:18.845]  Because they know damn well what they're doing.
[00:53:19.865 --> 00:53:23.206]  Just like all the news shows about hunting and killing Trump supporters.
[00:53:23.806 --> 00:53:30.668]  Netflix movie depicts time-traveling liberals carrying out pre-crime murder of patriots to prevent American uprising against globalism.
[00:53:31.108 --> 00:53:35.049]  Hollywood continues peddling fantasies of killing Trump supporters and conservatives.
[00:53:39.591 --> 00:53:41.071]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:53:41.111 --> 00:53:43.432]  They know in all the studies that when you hype mass shootings,
[00:53:46.044 --> 00:53:55.107]  It causes mentally ill people to go out and commit mass shootings and they know these are all trench coat wearing, white male, incel, devil worshippers that can't get a girl.
[00:53:55.508 --> 00:53:59.329]  Texas, the last three times, trench coat, devil worshippers can't get a girl.
[00:53:59.969 --> 00:54:02.090]  Ohio, trench coat, devil worshipper can't get a girl.
[00:54:03.831 --> 00:54:06.111]  Florida, Parkland, trench coat, devil worshipper can't get a girl.
[00:54:07.152 --> 00:54:09.513]  Sandy Hook, trench coat, devil worshipper can't get a girl.
[00:54:10.013 --> 00:54:12.794]  Harrison Kleibel, the original beta test, trench coat,
[00:54:13.979 --> 00:54:16.720]  Incel, devil whisperer, can't get a girl.
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:21.542]  And then the media hypes it and hypes it until it becomes an option.
[00:54:22.662 --> 00:54:23.522]  Don't commit suicide.
[00:54:23.562 --> 00:54:24.523]  Don't have suicide by cop.
[00:54:24.743 --> 00:54:25.663]  Don't jump off a bridge.
[00:54:26.343 --> 00:54:27.604]  Go kill people at a school!
[00:54:27.644 --> 00:54:28.584]  They're disarmed!
[00:54:29.004 --> 00:54:31.365]  And the demon in them directs them to do it.
[00:54:31.885 --> 00:54:40.908]  And then disarm the American people so the Red Terror can have its way with us in a full-long protracted civil war where America finally has its will broken.
[00:54:41.909 --> 00:54:42.629]  Not gonna happen.
[00:54:43.803 --> 00:54:45.083]  Because we've got the jump on you.
[00:54:46.964 --> 00:54:48.785]  We've got the jump on you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:50.425 --> 00:54:52.286]  We're gonna defeat the Globalists together.
[00:54:52.486 --> 00:55:03.769]  We're gonna go to break, come back with some good news about everything they're doing, falling on their face, their minions being exposed, from Trudeau to Thunberg, and then we'll take your phone calls.
[00:55:04.369 --> 00:55:08.071]  But this is the big push by the Globalists, this is the big fight, this is history.
[00:55:08.551 --> 00:55:09.231]  Please don't forget,
[00:55:10.313 --> 00:55:12.054]  We don't have Globalist or Soros funding.
[00:55:12.634 --> 00:55:16.835]  We're funded by listeners, viewers like you, and we make it easy with amazing products.
[00:55:17.195 --> 00:55:26.018]  We have store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points for your next order, and 50% off all of the award-winning high-quality supplements and preparedness items.
[00:55:26.038 --> 00:55:34.681]  That shortwave emergency radios, high-quality water filtration, air filtration, super good storable food, the very best you're going to get at this price, all of it.
[00:55:34.761 --> 00:55:37.562]  And with the free shipping on stuff like storable food, that's an amazing deal.
[00:55:40.697 --> 00:55:41.958]  Black Friday comes early.
[00:55:42.038 --> 00:55:52.988]  We've got to end this sale, though, in the next four or five days because a lot of things have already sold out and so things are going to be going off the list the next few days and we're going to have to end the sale by next weekend at the latest.
[00:55:53.388 --> 00:55:58.933]  We also have the new Beto Knott Try to Take Our Assault Weapon shirt that's now in, along with, guess what just got in?
[00:55:58.973 --> 00:56:00.574]  I got to shoot ads wearing these babies.
[00:56:01.595 --> 00:56:05.258]  That's right, the 51st state of America, the moon!
[00:56:05.819 --> 00:56:06.539]  No reviews yet.
[00:56:06.559 --> 00:56:08.221]  Nobody's done reviews of the shirts, but hey, look at them.
[00:56:09.238 --> 00:56:10.118]  Beauty's in the eye of the holder.
[00:56:10.138 --> 00:56:11.139]  I think it's an amazing design.
[00:56:11.199 --> 00:56:13.840]  Beto Knott, designed by a veteran, printed right here in Texas.
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:15.601]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:56:15.621 --> 00:56:16.621]  Whatever you do, take action.
[00:56:16.641 --> 00:56:20.543]  That's the only way we're going to win, is when you take action.
[00:56:22.204 --> 00:56:22.764]  Welcome back.
[00:56:22.804 --> 00:56:24.325]  Your phone calls are next segment.
[00:56:24.845 --> 00:56:26.706]  We'll continue right through the end of the show.
[00:56:26.906 --> 00:56:28.587]  Andrew Torb is going to pop in for two segments.
[00:56:28.607 --> 00:56:37.991]  The head of Gab to talk about the latest on the attacks and attempts to shut down any alternative media or organizational group that resists corporate world government.
[00:56:41.377 --> 00:56:50.099]  We have the deep state, we have the folks that have hijacked and taken over this nation, openly trying to remove our elected president.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:54.120]  And they have the money, they have the power.
[00:56:57.001 --> 00:57:07.924]  But they also have the slaves, the type of antifa that go and beat up old ladies or attack women and children who aren't even part of another demonstration, but just because they're white.
[00:57:08.735 --> 00:57:15.659]  White people scream effing Nazi pig and spit in their faces and spray pepper spray on them and beat them!
[00:57:16.319 --> 00:57:17.520]  And the left praises this!
[00:57:20.582 --> 00:57:23.163]  They hate the unborn, they hate the born, they hate the old.
[00:57:23.343 --> 00:57:26.045]  Every sign of evil is upon them.
[00:57:28.326 --> 00:57:29.927]  But we look at people like Greta Thunberg.
[00:57:30.127 --> 00:57:33.189]  She was in a press conference Friday.
[00:57:34.412 --> 00:57:36.393]  And she couldn't answer questions about anything.
[00:57:36.413 --> 00:57:37.573]  She kept looking at her handler.
[00:57:38.134 --> 00:57:39.054]  She doesn't run her Twitter.
[00:57:39.774 --> 00:57:40.575]  She's autistic.
[00:57:40.655 --> 00:57:41.455]  I feel sorry for her.
[00:57:42.896 --> 00:57:46.217]  She's literally another mentally ill person they use as a meat puppet.
[00:57:46.697 --> 00:57:52.540]  Just like half of the transsexual children in the UK and the US have serious autism.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:58.583]  They're poor little brain damaged children from the vaccines and the glyphosate and the pesticide and the food.
[00:57:58.603 --> 00:58:01.264]  And nobody's coming to help them.
[00:58:02.276 --> 00:58:07.038]  No, the system's coming to convince them to chop their genitals off as a sacramental Lucifer.
[00:58:07.058 --> 00:58:10.779]  You can't physically sacrifice them.
[00:58:10.799 --> 00:58:17.462]  You can destroy their ability to ever grow and have love and have children of their own.
[00:58:19.663 --> 00:58:20.983]  Oh, how they prey on our children.
[00:58:22.044 --> 00:58:28.727]  But here's a little piece put together, I guess, in the line of a Miller Lite ad from the 1990s about cuck life.
[00:58:29.227 --> 00:58:29.567]  Here it is.
[00:58:32.691 --> 00:58:36.596]  InfoWars presents Real Stable Genius.
[00:58:36.716 --> 00:58:39.359]  Real Stable Genius.
[00:58:39.599 --> 00:58:44.184]  Today we salute you, Mr. Climate Change Activist.
[00:58:44.364 --> 00:58:46.567]  Mr. Climate Change Activist!
[00:58:46.827 --> 00:58:52.053]  You tirelessly and fearlessly warn the world how the world is ending.
[00:58:52.253 --> 00:58:55.476]  Without a single pause to do any research.
[00:58:55.516 --> 00:58:57.298]  No time to study!
[00:58:57.318 --> 00:59:00.280]  50 years, 10 years, 10 months, 10 minutes.
[00:59:00.561 --> 00:59:03.303]  I'm surprised this commercial is still running.
[00:59:03.323 --> 00:59:04.604]  It's all over!
[00:59:04.785 --> 00:59:08.888]  You'll chain yourself to anything just to stop a cow fart.
[00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:11.531]  Climb a tower to fight the power.
[00:59:11.771 --> 00:59:15.515]  Superglue your tit to the street to stop the heat.
[00:59:15.735 --> 00:59:16.536]  I lost my nickel!
[00:59:17.156 --> 00:59:18.037]  Wow, that is funny.
[00:59:18.057 --> 00:59:20.079]  They tell me that came out last week.
[00:59:20.099 --> 00:59:23.682]  There's so much great information.
[00:59:23.802 --> 00:59:28.266]  Hardcore, serious, funny, in-depth, piercing.
[00:59:42.128 --> 00:59:45.510]  At Band.Video and InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:47.031]  You gotta check Band.Video every hour.
[00:59:47.091 --> 00:59:48.812]  There's just new amazing stuff there.
[00:59:48.872 --> 00:59:50.973]  Promos, memes, special reports.
[00:59:51.453 --> 00:59:52.033]  It's all there.
[00:59:52.053 --> 00:59:54.555]  And please share the links.
[00:59:54.575 --> 00:59:55.615]  That's how we reach new people.
[00:59:55.635 --> 00:59:56.616]  That's how you reach new people.
[00:59:56.656 --> 00:59:57.576]  We're all in this together.
[00:59:57.596 --> 01:00:00.298]  We've come a long way together.
[01:00:00.318 --> 01:00:01.699]  That's why they're trying to shut us all down.
[01:00:02.319 --> 01:00:03.740]  Now, here's just a short clip of this.
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:09.403]  I ended up watching a 21-minute clip on InfoWars Friday of Greta Thunberg
[01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:15.508]  And there were four or five questions to her where she just said, I can't answer your question.
[01:00:16.568 --> 01:00:17.809]  Here's just one of those.
[01:00:19.691 --> 01:00:27.136]  And again, if you're a radio listener, you can't see her, but she keeps looking at her handler who admittedly, again, is being funded by George Soros.
[01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:33.761]  And it came out the whole climate strike thing worldwide was funded by, of course, George Soros, which is just the front man for the globalist deep state.
[01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:34.982]  So here it is.
[01:00:37.927 --> 01:00:38.267]  I think...
[01:01:08.092 --> 01:01:09.833]  I'm sorry, what was the first question?
[01:01:11.314 --> 01:01:14.557]  What's the message you would like to send to our leaders by doing what you are doing?
[01:01:16.238 --> 01:01:22.383]  I think what we want to send is... The message we want to send is to say that we have had enough.
[01:01:23.543 --> 01:01:27.446]  And... Anyone else want to answer their question?
[01:01:28.347 --> 01:01:29.668]  I can't speak on behalf of everyone.
[01:01:31.249 --> 01:01:33.571]  Anyone wants to answer about the message to world leaders?
[01:01:39.887 --> 01:01:41.048]  What about President Trump?
[01:01:41.088 --> 01:01:42.009]  He's here today.
[01:01:42.049 --> 01:01:45.753]  Do you think he should respond?
[01:01:45.833 --> 01:01:48.776]  I think maybe you should give some questions to the others as well.
[01:01:57.555 --> 01:02:01.699]  And people are groveling to her, and she wouldn't answer any questions.
[01:02:02.059 --> 01:02:03.000]  She doesn't run her Twitter.
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:03.600]  She doesn't run anything.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.381]  It's totally fake.
[01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:05.422]  We all know that.
[01:02:05.802 --> 01:02:11.247]  And it fell flat on its face, which again, these people don't get the fact that no one is listening to them.
[01:02:11.907 --> 01:02:14.609]  Now, John Coleman was the founder of the Weather Channel.
[01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:16.031]  He came on our show several times.
[01:02:16.751 --> 01:02:18.072]  In fact, he came on my show once.
[01:02:18.453 --> 01:02:19.914]  It was like a dead a month later.
[01:02:20.394 --> 01:02:24.298]  So he was very well-spoken until the very end, very smart guy, and was a meteorologist.
[01:02:24.838 --> 01:02:29.380]  Here he is a few years ago, tearing little Brian Stelter a new boo-boo.
[01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:34.183]  A denier, that is a word meant to put me down.
[01:02:34.663 --> 01:02:36.584]  I'm a skeptic about climate change.
[01:02:36.944 --> 01:02:39.666]  And I want to make it darn clear, Mr. Kennedy is not a scientist.
[01:02:39.926 --> 01:02:40.266]  I am.
[01:02:40.586 --> 01:02:42.847]  He's the CEO of the Weather Channel now.
[01:02:43.448 --> 01:02:45.849]  I was the founder of the Weather Channel, not the co-founder.
[01:02:46.149 --> 01:02:48.551]  And I'm glad you did, because I am addicted to the Weather Channel.
[01:02:48.591 --> 01:02:49.232]  I watch a lot of cable news.
[01:02:49.272 --> 01:02:49.912]  You're not talking now.
[01:02:49.952 --> 01:02:50.853]  Hold on just a minute.
[01:02:50.893 --> 01:02:51.453]  I'm not done.
[01:02:52.214 --> 01:02:59.940]  And CNN has taken a very strong position on global warming that it is a consensus.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.162]  Well, there is no consensus in science.
[01:03:02.202 --> 01:03:03.263]  Science isn't a vote.
[01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:05.064]  Science is about facts.
[01:03:05.685 --> 01:03:07.827]  And if you get down to the hard, cold facts,
[01:03:09.311 --> 01:03:10.512]  There's no question about it.
[01:03:11.012 --> 01:03:12.812]  Climate change is not happening.
[01:03:13.212 --> 01:03:17.794]  There is no significant man-made global warming now.
[01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:21.775]  There hasn't been any in the past, and there's no reason to expect any in the future.
[01:03:22.195 --> 01:03:36.060]  There's a whole lot of baloney, and yes, it has become a big political point of the Democratic Party and part of their platform, and I regret it's become political instead of scientific, but the science is on my side.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.083]  I don't think we're going to come to a conclusion about the topic right here.
[01:03:39.543 --> 01:03:48.031]  I know we're not because you wouldn't allow it to happen on CNN, but I'm happy that I got on the air and got a chance to talk to your viewers.
[01:03:48.071 --> 01:03:49.032]  Hello everybody.
[01:03:49.052 --> 01:03:51.314]  There is no global warming.
[01:03:51.414 --> 01:03:53.856]  Let's stop right there.
[01:03:53.916 --> 01:03:57.419]  I'm going to play more of this later, but you know that he made the rounds.
[01:03:58.416 --> 01:04:02.258]  A decade ago or so, about a few years ago, and they banned him.
[01:04:02.559 --> 01:04:04.760]  He was a guy they wouldn't have on anymore because he's just too good.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.382]  Because they're saying there's a total consensus.
[01:04:08.282 --> 01:04:10.023]  And that he's a scientist and there's not a consensus.
[01:04:10.284 --> 01:04:12.405]  And then the majority of scientists say it's a total fraud.
[01:04:12.805 --> 01:04:14.486]  The only constant is climate change.
[01:04:15.787 --> 01:04:18.549]  But a volcano is more than all humans on Earth in a year.
[01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:21.711]  And it's good to have more carbon in the atmosphere, it turns out.
[01:04:23.729 --> 01:04:33.794]  But here's Trudeau, the leader of Canada, as we go out with another four-second clip, a new blackface video, where he has a giant zucchini in his pants.
[01:04:34.154 --> 01:04:35.115]  Let's go out with this.
[01:04:35.215 --> 01:04:38.517]  I mean, I've never been in blackface, but that's who these people are.
[01:04:38.557 --> 01:04:39.997]  Go ahead and roll Trudeau, please, as we go to break.
[01:04:42.819 --> 01:04:43.839]  I mean, look at him, folks.
[01:04:46.241 --> 01:04:48.702]  I mean, these people are insane.
[01:04:50.521 --> 01:05:01.747]  I only talk about the thought processes I'm going through on air because I'm empathetic and I see how I feel about things as the way you feel about them.
[01:05:02.627 --> 01:05:14.113]  And I think I pretty much am dead on that the audience of this show are activists that want to be free, that recognize evil for what it is, and that are trying to oppose it just from an instinctive and spiritual level.
[01:05:14.633 --> 01:05:16.514]  You can't help it but say no to this.
[01:05:17.895 --> 01:05:22.959]  And then it's very frustrating to see other people think it's a joke or think it's funny.
[01:05:23.779 --> 01:05:33.827]  I mean, I played football and I used to like to go over to my friends' houses from the time I was, you know, in elementary school to the time I was probably about 25 years old.
[01:05:34.467 --> 01:05:39.491]  And I'd watch the Super Bowl or I'd watch playoffs or I'd watch, you know, the World Series in baseball.
[01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:40.371]  I like baseball.
[01:05:41.252 --> 01:05:42.052]  I like the Olympics.
[01:05:42.113 --> 01:05:42.473]  It's great.
[01:05:44.537 --> 01:05:56.127]  But I see people get obsessed and angry and depressed if their team loses, or be super happy for a week when their team wins, when it doesn't matter.
[01:05:58.028 --> 01:06:00.771]  We have children being kept alive and their organs harvested.
[01:06:01.271 --> 01:06:06.495]  We have the Chi-Coms taking Christians and Buddhists and taking their organs by the millions.
[01:06:06.636 --> 01:06:07.977]  That's actually in the news today.
[01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:10.419]  A big whitewash, but they admit it's going on.
[01:06:12.116 --> 01:06:16.319]  And if we aren't empathetic for those people, it's going to happen to us.
[01:06:16.379 --> 01:06:22.482]  If we don't care what comes around, goes around, you reap what you sow, that's a law of the universe.
[01:06:24.223 --> 01:06:36.411]  And so, I was down in the break room getting a little cup of coffee during the break, and I just was standing there waiting for the coffee to finish making.
[01:06:37.191 --> 01:06:41.634]  Somebody started a new pot, and I
[01:06:43.692 --> 01:06:46.614]  Psychoanalyze myself that I was just very angry.
[01:06:50.676 --> 01:06:55.238]  And I just had to say to myself, listen, you're doing the best job you can.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.941]  But then I really sat back and said, no, you're not.
[01:07:00.201 --> 01:07:02.702]  We need to have people take action.
[01:07:03.523 --> 01:07:06.204]  And we need to develop a plan of how to take action.
[01:07:07.485 --> 01:07:09.626]  And we need to all really do it.
[01:07:10.643 --> 01:07:21.745]  That means I need to scan the internet to find out when Democrats are coming to Austin or San Antonio or Dallas or Houston.
[01:07:24.606 --> 01:07:25.526]  Democrat candidates.
[01:07:25.626 --> 01:07:33.028]  And I need to go to those events and I need to let the Democrats go crazy and make a big scene and have my talking points go viral.
[01:07:34.508 --> 01:07:36.749]  Now, if you aren't a known person,
[01:07:37.819 --> 01:07:44.983]  You're going to be able to go get right in the front row and bring up key points and take over national television on whatever points you think are important.
[01:07:46.884 --> 01:07:48.685]  Or you can get on an airplane and go to D.C.
[01:07:48.725 --> 01:07:52.268]  when they go back into session and they're going to try to impeach the president.
[01:07:52.308 --> 01:07:53.148]  We should be there.
[01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:57.831]  You go to D.C., there'll be maybe 20 Soros-funded people.
[01:07:59.429 --> 01:08:03.432]  At the most important hearings you could ever imagine and they all get the press coverage.
[01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:04.593]  I walk right up, boom.
[01:08:05.174 --> 01:08:06.535]  I get massive press coverage.
[01:08:07.195 --> 01:08:08.997]  People go, oh great job going and doing that.
[01:08:09.177 --> 01:08:10.157]  I'm in a war!
[01:08:12.439 --> 01:08:17.243]  But the average conservative or Christian is so humble, you're like, well it's not really my place to go do that.
[01:08:17.483 --> 01:08:18.304]  Hey, you better do it!
[01:08:21.334 --> 01:08:28.340]  And you better set your alarm and watch C-SPAN in the morning and call into Washington Journal and call into local talk radio when you're driving to work.
[01:08:28.801 --> 01:08:29.801]  You better do it at lunch.
[01:08:30.042 --> 01:08:32.864]  You better go eat your lunch in the parking lot and call talk radio.
[01:08:37.568 --> 01:08:39.490]  You better go speak to the legislature.
[01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:42.533]  You better take your neighbors out shooting and deprogram them.
[01:08:42.853 --> 01:08:44.154]  We're in a culture war.
[01:08:44.214 --> 01:08:47.177]  And listen, if we don't win this thing, it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:08:49.687 --> 01:08:54.809]  These people have a hunger for power because they want to control the future of the species.
[01:08:54.849 --> 01:08:56.850]  They want control over children.
[01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:01.291]  That's the payola they want.
[01:09:02.351 --> 01:09:08.874]  The whole cult is about hurting children and draining off their potential and their energy.
[01:09:09.134 --> 01:09:10.734]  The whole thing orbits that.
[01:09:14.816 --> 01:09:17.797]  And we must defend the children, born, unborn,
[01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:22.002]  And we've got to get aggressive in these bullies' faces.
[01:09:23.002 --> 01:09:27.984]  I mean, every day I see new videos of anti-foot bullying and beating up old women on walkers and wheelchairs.
[01:09:28.004 --> 01:09:31.165]  And you go, why would they attack out of a whole crowd of people?
[01:09:32.786 --> 01:09:34.986]  Why would they go target just an old woman going across the street?
[01:09:35.907 --> 01:09:45.250]  Because when you are a Satanist, you instinctively do the most wicked thing you can because it feels good.
[01:09:46.150 --> 01:09:47.671]  A normal person would be embarrassed
[01:09:48.601 --> 01:09:49.041]  For weeks.
[01:09:49.862 --> 01:09:53.905]  Would struggle with it for the rest of their lives, bullying an old woman for no reason.
[01:09:54.365 --> 01:09:56.026]  These people don't have consciences.
[01:09:56.346 --> 01:09:56.927]  They love it.
[01:09:57.807 --> 01:10:02.370]  And when you and I stand down, they take the field and they rule everything.
[01:10:04.752 --> 01:10:06.393]  The latest footage is on Infowars.com.
[01:10:06.453 --> 01:10:07.274]  It needs to get out.
[01:10:09.435 --> 01:10:11.496]  Now there's a lot of other geopolitical news.
[01:10:11.877 --> 01:10:13.778]  Huge fires engulfed New Saudi.
[01:10:14.458 --> 01:10:16.460]  High-speed rail station, it got blown up.
[01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:21.205]  Their press is so controlled, you're not going to hear that it's a terror attack.
[01:10:22.126 --> 01:10:24.348]  They had half their oil capacity blown up.
[01:10:26.429 --> 01:10:29.812]  The King's bodyguard got killed yesterday.
[01:10:30.112 --> 01:10:31.093]  They say it's an accident.
[01:10:31.153 --> 01:10:32.214]  Move along, no big deal.
[01:10:37.198 --> 01:10:39.639]  The Crown Prince came out and said, we don't want war with Iran.
[01:10:39.679 --> 01:10:41.080]  That would cause a world depression.
[01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:44.503]  Iran came out and said, we're going to blow up Israel and Saudi Arabia.
[01:10:44.543 --> 01:10:45.204]  Those are statements.
[01:10:46.385 --> 01:10:46.965]  There it is right here.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:52.981]  Destroying Israel is an achievable goal.
[01:10:54.782 --> 01:10:56.623]  Why do you think Iran is so bold?
[01:10:57.603 --> 01:11:01.225]  Because they're working with the globalist deep state that believes they're going to have Trump out soon.
[01:11:02.486 --> 01:11:04.407]  And they've been greenlit to do whatever they want.
[01:11:07.645 --> 01:11:10.047]  And now there's a civil war again in Saudi Arabia.
[01:11:10.828 --> 01:11:13.490]  By the way, this week, what, tomorrow, isn't it?
[01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:15.611]  Is the two-year anniversary of Vegas.
[01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.333]  They still won't tell you what happened there.
[01:11:17.353 --> 01:11:19.094]  It's a Saudi civil war.
[01:11:19.755 --> 01:11:22.697]  They had 10,000 Saudi military there for a conference.
[01:11:25.139 --> 01:11:28.662]  They used a gunrunner from the CIA to bring them weapons because they couldn't bring them into the country.
[01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:34.166]  And the group against Trump did all that to embarrass Trump.
[01:11:37.796 --> 01:11:39.477]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff going on.
[01:11:39.517 --> 01:11:41.557]  That's just one little stack here.
[01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:44.738]  Massive crackdowns in Hong Kong.
[01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:51.760]  More military pouring in on the 70th anniversary coming up of Mao's takeover and mass murder in China.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:03.944]  And I see articles all over the news praising Mao and celebrating 70 years of communism like they're talking about, you know, 70 years of the World's Fair or something.
[01:12:05.145 --> 01:12:14.833]  We're going to go to break, I promise, and come back with Jayvon and Brandon and Josh and Lillian and Frank and Jack and Kirby and Kim and Peter and Luke and I'm just going to move the person and move to the next.
[01:12:16.154 --> 01:12:17.716]  What do you think about their move to impeach Trump?
[01:12:18.356 --> 01:12:19.357]  Are they going to try to kill him?
[01:12:19.978 --> 01:12:21.319]  What should we do to counter this?
[01:12:22.119 --> 01:12:26.083]  Because I don't want to just sit here like a spectator while history is happening.
[01:12:26.964 --> 01:12:30.847]  Don't just go to live Democratic events and legally and lawfully take them over in a peaceful way.
[01:12:32.486 --> 01:12:33.146]  What else are you going to do?
[01:12:33.186 --> 01:12:36.668]  Are you going to pay for airplanes to drag messages around towns and cities?
[01:12:38.789 --> 01:12:51.697]  We've got to get the message out that we know the corporate media is a bunch of liars, and this country isn't a civil war, but the people running this civil war are anti-Americans that say our country shouldn't even exist, and our president's bad for saying it shouldn't even exist.
[01:12:52.757 --> 01:12:53.798]  But what are your other ideas?
[01:12:53.898 --> 01:12:56.359]  What do we do now to not be spectators?
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.922]  Before this gets pushed into a physical civil war, and we wish we would have worked
[01:13:01.721 --> 01:13:03.621]  Back when we had a chance to fix things peacefully.
[01:13:03.941 --> 01:13:05.582]  Let me tell you something.
[01:13:05.602 --> 01:13:13.083]  If you're not going to knock on doors now, if you're not going to fly airplane banners now, if you're not going to go speak at the State House now, if you're not going to travel to D.C.
[01:13:13.103 --> 01:13:20.444]  and go to these congressmen's offices and speak to them now, you'll never do it later.
[01:13:21.544 --> 01:13:22.605]  Look at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:13:23.745 --> 01:13:28.246]  The head of the committee, Schiff, came out and said impeachment vote by end of the year.
[01:13:28.266 --> 01:13:30.066]  I already told you, Pelosi announced it.
[01:13:31.223 --> 01:13:36.765]  They're gonna have the articles by Thanksgiving, and they intend to impeach him by Christmas!
[01:13:37.405 --> 01:13:37.985]  It's real!
[01:13:38.265 --> 01:13:39.245]  They're making their move!
[01:13:39.565 --> 01:13:40.346]  This isn't a joke!
[01:13:40.726 --> 01:13:44.367]  This is as important as 1776 and the Civil War in the 1860s.
[01:13:44.867 --> 01:13:48.568]  And everybody better get ready and get in position, because this is it, boys!
[01:13:51.243 --> 01:13:53.505]  The United States was founded by Christians.
[01:13:53.525 --> 01:13:58.269]  It was also founded by people that wanted to get away from royalty and be able to set up their own thing.
[01:13:58.970 --> 01:14:02.353]  We've been the Wild Wild West for really 400 years.
[01:14:03.173 --> 01:14:05.095]  Hundreds of years before we became a nation.
[01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:06.316]  We were colonies.
[01:14:07.377 --> 01:14:09.018]  And now history is repeating itself.
[01:14:09.799 --> 01:14:14.303]  Powerful globalist combines that came in and took control of the U.S.
[01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:17.626]  and used our power to expand their world empire.
[01:14:18.539 --> 01:14:18.719]  Are you
[01:14:40.779 --> 01:14:42.340]  That Trump's going to win in 2020.
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.782]  They see all these federal judges he's appointing.
[01:14:45.282 --> 01:14:52.147]  They know Ruth Bader Ginsburg has got patriotic cancer and it's hanging on by her little fingernails.
[01:14:53.187 --> 01:14:55.089]  And they intend to remove him.
[01:14:55.769 --> 01:14:58.111]  People say, well, this is preposterous, the reason they're going to use.
[01:14:58.931 --> 01:15:04.255]  They're going to have just whistleblower after whistleblower and rape victims come forward.
[01:15:04.335 --> 01:15:07.918]  And it's going to be a hailstorm of lies by a pack of known liars.
[01:15:08.786 --> 01:15:10.927]  They're going to threaten the Senators.
[01:15:13.107 --> 01:15:27.632]  And there's a good chance the Senators are going to buckle unless we reach out to all those Senators and all those new freshman Democrats in swing states in the Midwest, and unless we go to all their public events, and unless we absolutely get on their tails.
[01:15:28.188 --> 01:15:30.109]  And let the Democrats know we're not intimidated.
[01:15:30.409 --> 01:15:31.809]  They're going to rampage forward.
[01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:43.292]  All of this letting them try to engineer civil war and all of them letting Antifa attack people has encouraged them and the IRS being sick on conservatives and not even being stopped.
[01:15:44.273 --> 01:15:46.493]  All of this has made them think they can do anything.
[01:15:49.094 --> 01:15:51.395]  So we have to get back in their faces right now.
[01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:54.101]  Yes, cyberspace is great.
[01:15:54.701 --> 01:15:58.702]  Spreading the live links to Infowars.com forward slash show and band dot video is wonderful.
[01:15:59.742 --> 01:16:01.723]  Word of mouth telling people that the broadcast is wonderful.
[01:16:01.763 --> 01:16:02.823]  Donating to Trump's wonderful.
[01:16:02.863 --> 01:16:03.463]  Buying products.
[01:16:03.723 --> 01:16:05.444]  Infowars store is key to keep us on air.
[01:16:05.844 --> 01:16:08.084]  They want us off the air as much as they want Trump out of office.
[01:16:08.404 --> 01:16:10.645]  We come together like a horse and carriage.
[01:16:13.525 --> 01:16:14.906]  But I'm going to open the phones up now.
[01:16:16.086 --> 01:16:17.226]  What do you think we should do?
[01:16:18.286 --> 01:16:20.327]  How do we strike back legally and lawfully?
[01:16:21.226 --> 01:16:23.328]  You know they're winding up more mass shootings to blame us.
[01:16:24.789 --> 01:16:26.851]  You know they're getting ready to bomb buildings and blame it on us.
[01:16:28.532 --> 01:16:29.253]  You can smell it.
[01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:29.853]  You can see it.
[01:16:29.893 --> 01:16:32.856]  You know what they did in Oklahoma City in 1995.
[01:16:32.916 --> 01:16:33.556]  They got caught.
[01:16:33.837 --> 01:16:34.517]  Clinton got caught.
[01:16:34.697 --> 01:16:35.198]  He didn't care.
[01:16:35.218 --> 01:16:36.899]  He got re-elected on it.
[01:16:39.321 --> 01:16:44.646]  They're gonna use their censorship system in your emails, and in your voicemail, and in your text messages.
[01:16:44.686 --> 01:16:45.707]  They're in everything.
[01:16:47.025 --> 01:16:51.848]  Big Tech was built by the globalists for this move against America, and they're making their move!
[01:16:53.129 --> 01:16:58.813]  Alright, we're gonna go to Luke, Jayvon, Brandon, Josh, Lillian, Frank, Kirby, Kim, Peter, and others.
[01:16:59.693 --> 01:17:01.134]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:17:01.154 --> 01:17:07.278]  Let's go to Jayvon in New Jersey.
[01:17:07.618 --> 01:17:08.579]  Jayvon, you're first up.
[01:17:08.599 --> 01:17:08.919]  Welcome.
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:11.581]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:17:11.981 --> 01:17:13.082]  I just wanted to
[01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:19.557]  No, why isn't the church standing up and hitting the streets first?
[01:17:21.018 --> 01:17:30.240]  If our nation is built on Christendom, and that's the foundation of this country, why aren't the men going out and standing up?
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:34.361]  What is it going to take for that to happen?
[01:17:35.014 --> 01:17:39.221]  Well, the IRS went after churches and told them they don't have any free speech, which they do.
[01:17:39.601 --> 01:17:41.424]  Trump reversed that illegal law.
[01:17:42.145 --> 01:17:45.370]  But still, the average glitterbug preacher just wants to be a movie star.
[01:17:46.457 --> 01:17:50.559]  You know, like ugly people going to talk radio, people that can't get into Hollywood become newscasters.
[01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:54.661]  A lot of these people, again, just want to be movie stars.
[01:17:55.081 --> 01:17:57.602]  And so they don't really want a church, they want a social club.
[01:17:58.703 --> 01:18:03.685]  And so they become 501c3, they follow the World Council of Churches directives.
[01:18:03.725 --> 01:18:04.666]  We've lost the churches.
[01:18:05.006 --> 01:18:07.247]  But I agree, patriots should go into the churches.
[01:18:08.328 --> 01:18:10.810]  And decide to speak up and to ask to speak before the church.
[01:18:11.351 --> 01:18:14.574]  And any half-decent church should have people doing that.
[01:18:15.414 --> 01:18:23.461]  And so, the salt of the earth, we have to go into these churches that have become dens of devils, and we have to say, hey, how about you march for life?
[01:18:24.042 --> 01:18:26.364]  Or how about you speak up for our president?
[01:18:26.404 --> 01:18:30.167]  If churches don't, it's a litmus test, everyone should leave those churches.
[01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:34.091]  Because they're not churches, they're nothing but waiting rooms for hell.
[01:18:36.388 --> 01:18:36.848]  I agree.
[01:18:37.889 --> 01:18:48.378]  It's only one person I hear talking closely related to things that you say on your show is Dr. Perry Stone and his church is in Cleveland, Tennessee.
[01:18:48.458 --> 01:18:51.861]  He's the only one that really speaks about this, and I think you should have him on your show.
[01:18:52.401 --> 01:18:58.226]  But Abraham Lincoln said that this should be talked about on every pulpit.
[01:18:59.247 --> 01:19:02.109]  I mean, God didn't give us a spirit of fear.
[01:19:02.129 --> 01:19:03.130]  Fear is of the devil.
[01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:05.872]  So why are everybody being afraid
[01:19:07.225 --> 01:19:07.785]  Talk about this.
[01:19:07.825 --> 01:19:09.706]  Nobody's talking about the Trump.
[01:19:10.466 --> 01:19:14.087]  If we allow this to get too far, it'll be our fault.
[01:19:14.947 --> 01:19:16.628]  Honestly, because God is watching us.
[01:19:16.688 --> 01:19:17.968]  What are we willing to put up for?
[01:19:18.549 --> 01:19:20.309]  We are not meant to be passive.
[01:19:20.429 --> 01:19:23.790]  We're not meant to be so humble that we don't stand for anything.
[01:19:25.151 --> 01:19:25.691]  Well, exactly.
[01:19:25.891 --> 01:19:34.033]  We're supposed to be humble about our strengths and gifts God gave us, but we're not supposed to be humble and let them rape children or devil worship and openly take over society.
[01:19:34.053 --> 01:19:36.174]  We're supposed to go out and we're supposed to conquer them.
[01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:37.630]  Exactly.
[01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:39.070]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:39.451]  You're right.
[01:19:39.731 --> 01:19:44.472]  We need the churches to take action, and we need the people to go into the churches and demand they take action.
[01:19:44.492 --> 01:19:44.972]  Anything else?
[01:19:45.012 --> 01:19:45.352]  He's gone.
[01:19:45.812 --> 01:19:46.612]  Okay, thank you, sir.
[01:19:47.412 --> 01:19:49.373]  Let's talk to Brandon in Montana.
[01:19:49.433 --> 01:19:50.753]  Thank you for holding her on the air, Brandon.
[01:19:51.933 --> 01:19:53.814]  Hey, hi Alex.
[01:19:53.854 --> 01:19:54.814]  Yeah, my name is Brandon.
[01:19:54.854 --> 01:19:55.614]  I'm from Montana.
[01:19:55.734 --> 01:19:58.135]  I've been listening to your show for several years.
[01:19:58.155 --> 01:19:59.595]  I'm a supporter of
[01:20:00.177 --> 01:20:01.257]  I'm listening to you, sir.
[01:20:19.924 --> 01:20:30.171]  Okay, instead of just calling in our shows and asking what we need to do, we all need to band together, in a peaceful manner, by the way, and go to Washington, D.C., and we need to make a statement.
[01:20:30.751 --> 01:20:34.854]  You know, we need to sit there and say, you are not removing our president, Nancy.
[01:20:35.154 --> 01:20:36.315]  You're not going to do this.
[01:20:36.575 --> 01:20:37.816]  He is lawfully elected.
[01:20:38.156 --> 01:20:39.657]  He won the electoral college.
[01:20:39.717 --> 01:20:41.078]  There was no Russian collusion.
[01:20:41.498 --> 01:20:42.879]  Mueller's report proved that.
[01:20:43.299 --> 01:20:44.060]  This is a lie.
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:44.961]  This is treason.
[01:20:45.001 --> 01:20:47.402]  And we all need to go there with a statement.
[01:20:47.682 --> 01:20:48.543]  Wear a Trump hat.
[01:20:49.218 --> 01:20:56.043]  Literally take a chain, go to a Home Depot, buy a chain, buy a padlock, put your own key with the padlock in your pocket as a symbol.
[01:20:56.063 --> 01:21:08.831]  When we say we are chained to the Constitution, he is our president, he was elected, and Trump himself, if he's listening to this message, because I know you've said that he listens to Infowars, he needs to go on national television.
[01:21:09.252 --> 01:21:13.253]  And ask the American people, and I'll be honored to go to Washington D.C.
[01:21:13.273 --> 01:21:14.814]  myself with my family.
[01:21:14.854 --> 01:21:16.535]  I got a two-year-old daughter to worry about.
[01:21:16.795 --> 01:21:23.417]  And I'll be honored to skip work, lose money out of my paycheck, and I'd be honored to sit there and protest.
[01:21:23.457 --> 01:21:24.277]  And he needs to hear it.
[01:21:24.297 --> 01:21:25.157]  Well, I'll go further.
[01:21:25.298 --> 01:21:32.840]  Employers that are patriots should let their employees be paid if the employees will spend the money for a hotel and everything to go to D.C.
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:36.261]  We've all got to chip in however we can or we're going to lose everything.
[01:21:36.301 --> 01:21:36.881]  God bless you.
[01:21:36.941 --> 01:21:37.802]  And another great idea.
[01:21:38.598 --> 01:21:43.064]  We need President Trump to do televised remarks to the nation about what's happening.
[01:21:43.304 --> 01:21:51.414]  It's one thing to tweet that they want to have martial law and they want to have a civil war and they want to overthrow the election and that they're coming after him because he's standing up for us.
[01:21:51.454 --> 01:21:52.035]  That's all true.
[01:21:53.490 --> 01:22:06.857]  But we need President Trump to come out from the Oval Office and address the criminals and the deep state that have sold this nation out and use the power of the presidency to absolutely annihilate them with the spoken word.
[01:22:07.098 --> 01:22:08.779]  And then he needs to do an emergency...
[01:22:09.659 --> 01:22:10.159]  We're good.
[01:22:35.091 --> 01:22:36.031]  State of the Union, remember?
[01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:38.212]  Because they were saying he wasn't really president and all that crap.
[01:22:38.772 --> 01:22:39.712]  He needs to do it again.
[01:22:39.732 --> 01:22:41.633]  He needs to do it right now.
[01:22:42.713 --> 01:22:43.293]  Great points.
[01:22:43.433 --> 01:22:44.273]  We only took two calls.
[01:22:44.333 --> 01:22:45.173]  I'm gonna go fast.
[01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:50.234]  Lillian, Frank, everybody, Peter, when we come back next hour, I'm going right to your calls.
[01:22:51.795 --> 01:22:52.915]  We're gonna get your ideas.
[01:22:52.935 --> 01:22:54.155]  We've already have some amazing ideas.
[01:22:54.195 --> 01:22:55.436]  Get the churches taking action.
[01:22:56.716 --> 01:23:00.717]  We need to get Trump to do more televised address, not just little
[01:23:01.786 --> 01:23:05.287]  Two minute things or minute long things or 45 second long things from the Rose Garden.
[01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:10.027]  He needs to absolutely let the globalists know that we're taking action.
[01:23:10.067 --> 01:23:10.828]  And you know what he is.
[01:23:11.408 --> 01:23:13.488]  They wouldn't be saying, oh Barr's a traitor.
[01:23:13.768 --> 01:23:14.488]  He's compromised.
[01:23:14.508 --> 01:23:18.489]  The Attorney General must step down if they didn't know the indictments are coming.
[01:23:18.689 --> 01:23:19.169]  Trump did it.
[01:23:19.269 --> 01:23:19.809]  He didn't blink.
[01:23:20.029 --> 01:23:20.829]  The indictments are there.
[01:23:21.289 --> 01:23:21.809]  It's confirmed.
[01:23:23.490 --> 01:23:30.351]  They don't have the Deputy Attorney General say no to stopping prosecution unless they've greenlit it.
[01:23:30.431 --> 01:23:30.791]  It's done.
[01:23:31.667 --> 01:23:32.807]  You want somebody to take action?
[01:23:33.067 --> 01:23:33.648]  He's doing it!
[01:23:34.128 --> 01:23:37.029]  And he's got all these cowards under him that are scared to implement it.
[01:23:37.569 --> 01:23:42.190]  All these people surrounding him, lying, leaking, blocking, surprised he can get anything done.
[01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:47.071]  All he can do is put the info out, be stalwart, and stand while he's surrounded, just like InfoWars.
[01:23:49.192 --> 01:23:51.393]  America and the world is surrounded by evil, but you know what?
[01:23:51.413 --> 01:23:52.933]  That means we can attack in all directions.
[01:23:52.973 --> 01:23:53.413]  Stay with us.
[01:23:55.154 --> 01:23:59.295]  Well, we were supposed to be off the air by now when they made their move to impeach Trump, but we're still here.
[01:24:00.265 --> 01:24:04.007]  You're spreading the word and getting the Paul Revere message out as modern Paul Revere's.
[01:24:04.027 --> 01:24:11.071]  No matter what color you are, where you came from, if you love freedom and justice, you're red-blooded, you're my brother, you're my sister, and I salute you.
[01:24:13.352 --> 01:24:24.598]  Hillary's been running around making the rounds saying that there's a clear and present danger what Trump's done to America when she's been overseeing the destruction of our sovereignty.
[01:24:24.638 --> 01:24:25.038]  Here she is.
[01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:33.855]  This occupant of the Oval Office poses a clear and present danger to our future, to our democracy.
[01:24:33.875 --> 01:24:38.818]  Yeah, lady, you're so mad you lost that election.
[01:24:38.858 --> 01:24:39.259]  Incredible.
[01:24:39.299 --> 01:24:40.559]  Going back to your phone calls now.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:42.341]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:24:42.441 --> 01:24:43.241]  Is it Lillian?
[01:24:43.361 --> 01:24:44.162]  Is it Peter?
[01:24:44.182 --> 01:24:48.605]  It's Peter, then it's Lillian, then Frank and others.
[01:24:49.265 --> 01:24:50.426]  Peter in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:24:50.526 --> 01:24:55.169]  What do we do to stop the impeachment, the hot civil war they're trying to start?
[01:24:56.704 --> 01:24:58.447]  Hey, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:24:58.707 --> 01:25:05.258]  I just wanted to say thank you to Owen as well for making those comedic pieces with Real Stable Genius.
[01:25:05.318 --> 01:25:09.165]  They're really funny and we need a little bit of laughter in these troubled times.
[01:25:09.445 --> 01:25:09.646]  We do!
[01:25:10.908 --> 01:25:11.248]  Yeah.
[01:25:11.808 --> 01:25:13.889]  I just want to thank you for waking me up.
[01:25:14.009 --> 01:25:26.031]  I do want to plug the products, but I honestly think the best thing that anyone can do right now in this sort of hysterical situation is get a Trump t-shirt, get a hat, go out there and represent no matter where you're going.
[01:25:26.092 --> 01:25:27.152]  I totally agree.
[01:25:27.252 --> 01:25:28.332]  Even if you're going downstairs.
[01:25:29.692 --> 01:25:29.932]  Sorry.
[01:25:30.352 --> 01:25:31.253]  Keep going.
[01:25:32.793 --> 01:25:36.774]  I wanted to plug the products too, but I want to just say all you single men out there,
[01:25:37.461 --> 01:25:38.244]  Get a t-shirt.
[01:25:38.525 --> 01:25:40.310]  Get Trump is my president t-shirt.
[01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:43.801]  I've been, I live in the bluest county there is.
[01:25:44.383 --> 01:25:45.045]  Coward County.
[01:25:45.632 --> 01:25:47.073]  And I'm not leaving.
[01:25:47.173 --> 01:25:48.193]  I'm here to change mine.
[01:25:48.453 --> 01:25:50.734]  I wear Trump Is My President t-shirt proudly.
[01:25:51.214 --> 01:25:54.176]  And for the single guys, take it to the store.
[01:25:54.276 --> 01:25:55.196]  Take it to the gym.
[01:25:55.256 --> 01:25:56.697]  You know you're going to be there for a few hours.
[01:25:56.897 --> 01:25:58.777]  My wife hates it when I wear that shirt.
[01:25:59.017 --> 01:26:01.158]  And it's not because I get the bad attention.
[01:26:01.198 --> 01:26:02.479]  It's because I get good attention.
[01:26:02.779 --> 01:26:04.240]  I've had women brush up on me.
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:07.621]  Black women, Spanish women, just wanting to talk to me about
[01:26:09.262 --> 01:26:13.666]  I want to be clear.
[01:26:13.806 --> 01:26:14.907]  The polls are all fake.
[01:26:14.947 --> 01:26:16.008]  That's been proven right.
[01:26:16.288 --> 01:26:17.589]  The movie reviews are fake.
[01:26:17.689 --> 01:26:18.390]  It's all fake.
[01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:19.751]  I get...
[01:26:21.078 --> 01:26:25.882]  I shake 50 hands for every person that flips me off or says F you, literally.
[01:26:26.542 --> 01:26:33.308]  And Trump is super popular, Infowars is super popular, the two are interchangeable, with minorities everywhere.
[01:26:33.328 --> 01:26:35.850]  Again, that's why the left's so panicked.
[01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:37.391]  Everyone is turning against them.
[01:26:37.871 --> 01:26:39.973]  All they have is election fraud to stay in power.
[01:26:41.465 --> 01:26:44.367]  They want us to be afraid of not wearing our true colors.
[01:26:44.427 --> 01:26:45.787]  And that's all it comes down to, Alex.
[01:26:45.827 --> 01:26:47.748]  And I want to say thank you again for the products, too.
[01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.949]  Especially the shirts.
[01:26:49.049 --> 01:26:49.429]  Thank you.
[01:26:49.489 --> 01:26:50.410]  Thank you for everything.
[01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:52.651]  Brother, we're in this together.
[01:26:52.711 --> 01:26:55.012]  And listen, it's a spiritual thing.
[01:26:55.352 --> 01:27:01.736]  We can't sign on to these devil worshippers and human sacrifice and killing babies after they're born.
[01:27:02.256 --> 01:27:03.777]  I mean, they're out in the open now.
[01:27:03.817 --> 01:27:09.400]  They're coming out in the open and admitting they want a world government, cashless society, end of the human race as we know it.
[01:27:10.545 --> 01:27:11.527]  I want to thank you.
[01:27:11.587 --> 01:27:12.889]  I keep trying to explain this, Peter.
[01:27:13.810 --> 01:27:16.333]  Without the listeners taking action, we're nothing.
[01:27:16.454 --> 01:27:17.635]  It's just symbiotic, brother.
[01:27:17.996 --> 01:27:18.777]  We're in this together.
[01:27:20.099 --> 01:27:21.180]  I know you were talking about Greta.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.122]  I'm going to make this quick.
[01:27:22.382 --> 01:27:25.767]  All the listeners out there, research her name called Severin.
[01:27:26.548 --> 01:27:27.849]  I remember that.
[01:27:27.889 --> 01:27:29.070]  What was her name?
[01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:29.530]  Suzuki?
[01:27:47.563 --> 01:27:50.224]  It was Severin, Severin Suzuki.
[01:27:50.625 --> 01:27:59.869]  And her dad, David Suzuki, he's a complete hypocrite, who told that the world population is going to die, that we should stop having children, but yet he has five children.
[01:28:00.389 --> 01:28:03.571]  And Severin Suzuki is wealthy beyond any measure now.
[01:28:03.831 --> 01:28:05.472]  So, I just want to say thank you, Alex.
[01:28:05.492 --> 01:28:07.953]  Thank you for everything, and God bless you, okay?
[01:28:08.353 --> 01:28:08.674]  Be safe.
[01:28:08.714 --> 01:28:09.454]  Wow, thank you.
[01:28:09.474 --> 01:28:10.915]  Again, that's why I love the callers.
[01:28:10.975 --> 01:28:13.436]  I'd totally forgotten about Severin Suzuki.
[01:28:13.496 --> 01:28:14.596]  I barely remembered that.
[01:28:14.657 --> 01:28:15.337]  That was Greta.
[01:28:16.971 --> 01:28:17.992]  We're good to go.
[01:28:38.388 --> 01:28:45.133]  20 years ago, it was a totally call-driven broadcast, but I've just gotten so many guests and so much info that I've shifted away from calls, but we're bringing calls back.
[01:28:45.193 --> 01:28:49.856]  It's a big part of this show and the other shows that we're producing here live on air.
[01:28:51.497 --> 01:28:51.857]  I love it.
[01:28:51.877 --> 01:28:57.701]  I get these questions from mainstream media, but also people on the street, and they say, are you really for real?
[01:28:57.721 --> 01:28:59.122]  Do you really believe all this?
[01:29:00.963 --> 01:29:02.424]  Of course I believe all this.
[01:29:03.805 --> 01:29:04.746]  Of course I'm for real.
[01:29:06.479 --> 01:29:09.741]  And the establishment media constantly tells you that, oh, I'm an actor.
[01:29:10.282 --> 01:29:11.663]  Oh, Jones says he's fake.
[01:29:11.723 --> 01:29:12.884]  Jones says he's not for real.
[01:29:13.284 --> 01:29:13.584]  Really?
[01:29:13.804 --> 01:29:14.545]  Where did I say that?
[01:29:15.186 --> 01:29:15.986]  Show me the video.
[01:29:17.107 --> 01:29:18.008]  Show me where I said it.
[01:29:18.068 --> 01:29:18.888]  Show me the audio.
[01:29:19.849 --> 01:29:20.389]  You can't do it.
[01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.931]  It's lies.
[01:29:23.272 --> 01:29:24.072]  It's all lies.
[01:29:29.556 --> 01:29:31.398]  We told you they're going to start a civil war.
[01:29:31.478 --> 01:29:33.139]  We told you they're going to try to kill the president.
[01:29:33.379 --> 01:29:34.800]  We told you they're going to start impeachment.
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:35.681]  It's all happening.
[01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:38.131]  And everybody's like, yeah, but there's nothing there.
[01:29:38.711 --> 01:29:39.852]  It doesn't matter!
[01:29:43.034 --> 01:29:45.955]  Because the Congress, on average, are a bunch of cowards.
[01:29:46.015 --> 01:29:46.896]  Jim Jordan's great.
[01:29:47.436 --> 01:29:48.557]  Kevin Nunes is amazing.
[01:29:48.577 --> 01:29:52.659]  A lot of those guys are great, but there's not that many of them.
[01:29:52.759 --> 01:29:57.962]  And, you know, the Democrats sent a Bernie supporter to try to kill them all at a baseball game.
[01:29:57.982 --> 01:29:58.422]  Remember that?
[01:30:02.844 --> 01:30:03.285]  But there was...
[01:30:04.594 --> 01:30:12.298]  One security officer there with a gun who shot the shooter in one second.
[01:30:13.418 --> 01:30:22.403]  The guy opened up, shot Scalise in the hip, through the guts, and was down within one second.
[01:30:23.303 --> 01:30:26.665]  If that wouldn't have happened, they could have killed a lot of those members.
[01:30:28.578 --> 01:30:30.479]  Don't think they won't fly a plane into the Capitol.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:34.883]  Don't think they won't blow up a Republican train when they're going to one of their yearly retreats.
[01:30:35.303 --> 01:30:37.105]  Remember last year, it got blown up?
[01:30:37.345 --> 01:30:39.606]  And the news just said, oh, the train got stopped.
[01:30:39.887 --> 01:30:41.428]  No, the tracks got blown up!
[01:30:42.168 --> 01:30:45.191]  Just like they blew up the trains in Saudi Arabia today.
[01:30:45.751 --> 01:30:48.673]  And the King's bodyguard got shot yesterday.
[01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:51.215]  And the oil fields blew up two weeks ago.
[01:30:52.957 --> 01:30:55.579]  The world is in a war between different factions.
[01:30:57.449 --> 01:30:58.850]  Between China and America.
[01:30:59.110 --> 01:31:02.171]  I've been telling you that for years and now the UN head came out and said it.
[01:31:02.731 --> 01:31:03.152]  Last week.
[01:31:04.672 --> 01:31:06.613]  But our president gave a speech that was incredible.
[01:31:07.374 --> 01:31:10.095]  Just the things he said are devastating to the globalists.
[01:31:13.516 --> 01:31:15.117]  And so I'm going to ask you, what do we do?
[01:31:15.137 --> 01:31:17.098]  I don't want to just sit here and take it.
[01:31:19.719 --> 01:31:21.480]  I'm going to be getting on airplanes to DC.
[01:31:22.621 --> 01:31:22.881]  Oh yeah.
[01:31:23.541 --> 01:31:25.662]  And I'm going to be going out and confronting these people.
[01:31:27.039 --> 01:31:29.840]  But I can't get up close like you can't.
[01:31:31.141 --> 01:31:34.283]  And just simply hit them with whatever their corruption is.
[01:31:34.923 --> 01:31:36.064]  Every Democratic candidate.
[01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:37.184]  Every operative.
[01:31:37.224 --> 01:31:38.005]  Every live show.
[01:31:38.665 --> 01:31:39.165]  Get in there.
[01:31:39.385 --> 01:31:39.986]  Take them over.
[01:31:40.126 --> 01:31:40.546]  It's legal.
[01:31:40.586 --> 01:31:41.046]  It's lawful.
[01:31:41.547 --> 01:31:45.269]  It's what they've got the left doing, except they're beating up old people in wheelchairs and walkers.
[01:31:45.549 --> 01:31:46.109]  Don't do that!
[01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:49.171]  Help the little old ladies across the street.
[01:31:50.751 --> 01:31:55.414]  Go around the Antifa, that's a decoy for us to clash with, and go find the Democrats
[01:31:57.185 --> 01:32:02.388]  And take over those live TV programs like we did in 2016 with Bill Clinton's rapist.
[01:32:04.949 --> 01:32:06.470]  Hillary for prison, lock her up.
[01:32:06.490 --> 01:32:09.912]  Because it's all a confidence battle now.
[01:32:10.172 --> 01:32:21.918]  The President's being super confident, but he is surrounded by traitors and cowards and people that have been threatened and people that have been told, when Trump goes down, if you haven't joined us, we're going to destroy you.
[01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:24.572]  Well, why the hell do you want to live like that?
[01:32:24.952 --> 01:32:29.856]  America was about standing up for what you believed in, even if it got you killed.
[01:32:30.156 --> 01:32:36.442]  And because people are willing to die, we had incredible wealth and freedom, because tyrants and the corrupt lived in fear.
[01:32:41.506 --> 01:32:46.190]  The creed of slaves is bowing down and hoping that evil passes you over.
[01:32:50.009 --> 01:32:52.410]  We've gotten in this position by licking their boots.
[01:32:52.670 --> 01:32:54.530]  I won't sit here and be part of it anymore.
[01:32:54.550 --> 01:33:08.954]  And I'm going to tell you as God is my witness, if you don't get politically involved and really aggressive now, and if I don't do it, this is not business as usual.
[01:33:08.994 --> 01:33:10.335]  This is not status quo.
[01:33:14.336 --> 01:33:16.876]  It's 100% chance there's going to be a bloody civil war.
[01:33:18.217 --> 01:33:18.977]  And it's going to be dirty.
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:24.303]  They're going to false flag and do massacres you've never even imagined and blame it on us.
[01:33:25.624 --> 01:33:27.585]  And it's going to test the very mettle of this country.
[01:33:28.566 --> 01:33:32.849]  So we're up to the edge of the cliff right now, and if you don't feel it, there's something wrong with you.
[01:33:34.610 --> 01:33:40.495]  Let me tell you folks, people better get on their knees and pray, and then you better hit the streets and get active.
[01:33:41.576 --> 01:33:43.777]  And I mean get real active and real aggressive.
[01:33:44.798 --> 01:33:46.639]  And yeah, it's great to give Trump donations.
[01:33:46.699 --> 01:33:49.361]  It's great to buy products at InfoWare store to keep us on air.
[01:33:49.401 --> 01:33:49.942]  That's critical.
[01:33:51.852 --> 01:34:18.391]  But it's just as critical that when Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff and all these horrible, dirty criminals are in their congressional offices, that you be there, and that you go there, and you bring your children with you, and you go in there and you tell them, I know who you are, you dirty rat, and you're gonna be brought to justice for what you've done, and you just need to know in the name of Jesus Christ,
[01:34:19.531 --> 01:34:21.392]  That all servants of Satan are going to be defeated.
[01:34:21.452 --> 01:34:22.712]  And believe me, they know who they serve.
[01:34:22.732 --> 01:34:23.232]  They're scared.
[01:34:23.512 --> 01:34:24.433]  They will shake.
[01:34:25.413 --> 01:34:27.654]  And I want everybody to pray for justice.
[01:34:28.454 --> 01:34:29.175]  God's justice.
[01:34:30.035 --> 01:34:35.357]  God's perfect justice to be brought against Pelosi and all these type people.
[01:34:37.038 --> 01:34:38.258]  That's whatever God's justice is.
[01:34:38.298 --> 01:34:41.419]  I don't wish any harm upon them, especially because that would make them martyrs.
[01:34:41.919 --> 01:34:45.781]  But justice that corruption and the evils they've done be brought to light.
[01:34:45.841 --> 01:34:46.821]  And it is going to be brought to light.
[01:34:47.061 --> 01:34:48.782]  You're going to see incredible corruption come out.
[01:34:50.353 --> 01:34:51.714]  You're going to see them exposed.
[01:34:51.734 --> 01:34:53.634]  You're going to see how pathetic they are.
[01:34:54.975 --> 01:34:56.815]  Because there's not just evil in the universe, there's good.
[01:34:56.835 --> 01:35:01.097]  And as long as we hold the line and don't back down, God will take us the rest of the way.
[01:35:01.417 --> 01:35:03.198]  But God wants to see action.
[01:35:06.319 --> 01:35:08.760]  When they go to their districts, you need to be there.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.022]  When they go to their offices, you need to be there.
[01:35:14.642 --> 01:35:15.462]  They're your servants.
[01:35:15.782 --> 01:35:16.603]  Not the Chi-Coms.
[01:35:16.843 --> 01:35:17.583]  Not the globalists.
[01:35:17.843 --> 01:35:19.324]  And we've got a real servant in Trump.
[01:35:20.253 --> 01:35:23.175]  And if we don't defend him, we get what we deserve.
[01:35:25.137 --> 01:35:28.239]  If you think you're safer hiding out during this, you're a fool.
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:30.601]  They're coming for everybody.
[01:35:32.622 --> 01:35:34.784]  Lillian in South Carolina, thanks for holding.
[01:35:34.804 --> 01:35:36.645]  You're on the air worldwide on this Monday edition.
[01:35:36.825 --> 01:35:37.846]  Thank you so much for calling.
[01:35:39.908 --> 01:35:42.770]  Hi Alex, I would like to just speak to the listeners.
[01:35:43.567 --> 01:35:47.869]  I listened to the other two callers and they were great.
[01:35:48.329 --> 01:35:53.371]  And I want to encourage them to speak, to continue speaking the truth.
[01:35:54.471 --> 01:35:57.532]  Not only speaking the truth, but being the truth, living it.
[01:35:58.313 --> 01:36:05.735]  And continue to speak the truth and be the truth to the churches and in the streets, everywhere you are.
[01:36:06.396 --> 01:36:12.598]  But also know that Christ said, God said that it would be a remnant.
[01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.209]  Okay.
[01:36:43.402 --> 01:36:55.407]  That is a regular listening...listener to your show would commit to give just $5 a month faithfully every month until this thing is over.
[01:36:55.527 --> 01:36:58.408]  And again, it's not going to be over until Jesus comes again.
[01:36:58.828 --> 01:37:07.011]  But if they would commit to just giving $5 a month, let's say there's 2 million of us faithful listeners out there.
[01:37:07.411 --> 01:37:09.112]  If you multiply $5 times 2 million,
[01:37:11.906 --> 01:37:19.147]  That would be $10 million a month that Alex would be getting in that he could count on.
[01:37:19.187 --> 01:37:20.067]  Well, I promise this.
[01:37:20.147 --> 01:37:22.488]  If we get $10 million a month, there won't be any private jets.
[01:37:22.528 --> 01:37:23.368]  I'll be flying coach.
[01:37:23.848 --> 01:37:29.149]  I could absolutely change history with $10 million a month actual money to run things.
[01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:31.689]  My God, $10 million extra a year, we could do incredible things.
[01:37:32.109 --> 01:37:35.790]  And I know only a fraction go and get things, but the people got their toothpaste from us.
[01:37:36.710 --> 01:37:40.831]  It's filler-free with colloidal silver and iodine, fluoride-free.
[01:37:41.471 --> 01:37:43.716]  But there's not the silicate in it and all the rest of that, folks.
[01:37:43.776 --> 01:37:44.858]  It's just pure toothpaste.
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:49.989]  And if people just got their toothpaste and their coffee from us every month, we would be able to do it all.
[01:37:50.049 --> 01:37:51.312]  So I want to thank you so much.
[01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:52.454]  You want to add anything else, Lillian?
[01:37:53.490 --> 01:37:54.530]  Yes, Alex, I do.
[01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:55.291]  We'll stay there.
[01:37:55.311 --> 01:37:58.231]  We've got Andrew Torba popping in for a segment or so or two.
[01:37:58.431 --> 01:38:01.592]  Then we'll go back to all your calls and Gerald Cilente coming up.
[01:38:01.612 --> 01:38:08.094]  But I'm going to come right back to you, Lillian, and then Frank and Kirby and Kim and Micah and Jack and Luke.
[01:38:08.114 --> 01:38:08.794]  We'll get to everybody.
[01:38:08.834 --> 01:38:10.875]  Bobby, we'll get to everybody.
[01:38:10.895 --> 01:38:11.315]  Stay with us.
[01:38:12.416 --> 01:38:13.516]  From this day onward.
[01:38:16.357 --> 01:38:19.338]  You know, I know how serious the Globalists are.
[01:38:19.358 --> 01:38:20.558]  I've been out to many of their events.
[01:38:22.090 --> 01:38:25.992]  From very high levels of their system down to the lowest, I've seen who they serve.
[01:38:27.212 --> 01:38:39.378]  And that's why when callers call in and tell me what a great job I'm doing, it's... It's a weird feeling, because I know how bad these people are, and I'm really mad at myself for not fighting hard enough, and not doing enough.
[01:38:40.418 --> 01:38:47.021]  I mean, we're dealing with absolute pure evil, and the way we've all just been desensitized and put into this comfort zone to live right next to it.
[01:38:48.161 --> 01:38:49.922]  And then quite frankly, I think about other options.
[01:38:50.763 --> 01:38:51.403]  That info war.
[01:38:52.352 --> 01:39:01.078]  And on every path with the brainwashing they've run, that'll only turn out against us, even though it's spiritually right at this point to physically remove these people from power.
[01:39:02.099 --> 01:39:04.641]  And President Trump's the leader to give those orders.
[01:39:04.681 --> 01:39:05.642]  He is the Commander-in-Chief.
[01:39:05.662 --> 01:39:06.302]  We elected him.
[01:39:06.863 --> 01:39:08.304]  He's now pointing out this is treason.
[01:39:08.364 --> 01:39:13.708]  He's saying we may have to physically move against them because they're going to physically move on him and you and your family and mine.
[01:39:14.787 --> 01:39:18.068]  And it's a very big time to be alive here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:18.148 --> 01:39:23.431]  I just cannot stress on you enough the incredible urgency that we are now in.
[01:39:24.611 --> 01:39:33.055]  And it's so good how God is helping us in so many ways, and the goodness we see across the world, and good rising to the challenge of evil.
[01:39:33.655 --> 01:39:40.978]  But then it makes it that much more serious when I think about my children, and my three daughters especially, how innocent they are.
[01:39:40.998 --> 01:39:43.779]  And I think about how good they are.
[01:39:45.247 --> 01:39:50.791]  You know, God created them and I will not turn them over to Satan.
[01:39:50.911 --> 01:39:51.632]  I will not do it.
[01:39:51.752 --> 01:39:52.673]  I will lead them to light.
[01:39:55.055 --> 01:40:00.299]  But the stress of this is I'm really mad at myself because I don't feel like I'm doing enough.
[01:40:01.351 --> 01:40:03.192]  And I know how you are as well, listeners.
[01:40:03.252 --> 01:40:07.694]  You feel like you're humble and you feel like you're not doing enough, but just ask God to lead God and direct you.
[01:40:08.814 --> 01:40:09.834]  And together we're going to do it.
[01:40:09.854 --> 01:40:12.876]  But, you know, we're going to be talking to Andrew Torba and he'll take calls with us as well.
[01:40:13.696 --> 01:40:16.097]  And then Salenti's coming up, but I'm going to take some of that time as well.
[01:40:16.957 --> 01:40:18.898]  And I just want to encourage all of you to realize that
[01:40:20.307 --> 01:40:21.447]  There is a God in the universe.
[01:40:21.467 --> 01:40:22.328]  There's not just evil.
[01:40:22.368 --> 01:40:23.608]  And we're going to come through this together.
[01:40:23.668 --> 01:40:26.129]  But the deep state is moving on the president.
[01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:34.192]  And the fact that he is for real, the fact that he has so much courage and is so surrounded, it's a microcosm of our own lives and our children who are surrounded.
[01:40:34.692 --> 01:40:36.713]  And it just makes me beyond angry.
[01:40:36.753 --> 01:40:40.314]  It makes me completely driven to beat these people.
[01:40:41.323 --> 01:40:45.166]  And I think we're going to do it, but it's going to take getting in their faces.
[01:40:45.266 --> 01:40:48.569]  Not the way they do it, beating up old people and stuff, but I mean rebuking them.
[01:40:49.049 --> 01:40:54.073]  And I don't mean like some fake church glitter bug, I mean the real fire of God type stuff.
[01:40:54.634 --> 01:40:56.555]  And that's going to come by asking God into you.
[01:40:56.775 --> 01:40:58.236]  This is good versus evil.
[01:40:58.757 --> 01:41:02.560]  Let's go to that caller and then I'll go to Mr. Torba and then we'll continue with calls on here.
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:06.142]  Lillian, you were making some points though about what Trump should do, what we should do.
[01:41:07.003 --> 01:41:10.665]  And as the darkness settles in, we can really see it is good versus evil.
[01:41:11.846 --> 01:41:14.868]  You know, we see all the occultism of Jack Dorsey coming out.
[01:41:15.008 --> 01:41:16.088]  Everything's being revealed.
[01:41:16.569 --> 01:41:18.090]  At the base of this is Satanism.
[01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:19.671]  Yes.
[01:41:20.411 --> 01:41:22.932]  Yes.
[01:41:22.952 --> 01:41:28.276]  I didn't mean to say this was or infer that this would be a substitute.
[01:41:28.456 --> 01:41:28.836]  I am
[01:41:29.588 --> 01:41:32.950]  I love the products that you have.
[01:41:33.051 --> 01:41:36.873]  I buy them, my husband and I both take the supplements every day.
[01:41:36.893 --> 01:41:42.717]  I give them as Christmas gifts, birthday gifts, everything I can think of.
[01:41:43.238 --> 01:41:44.118]  Thank you.
[01:41:44.238 --> 01:41:47.100]  And I love them and particularly I do like a pee.
[01:41:48.321 --> 01:41:56.467]  It kind of gives a little bit of relief from that stress.
[01:41:57.626 --> 01:41:59.207]  You like the what particularly, ma'am?
[01:42:00.228 --> 01:42:01.188]  The appeased.
[01:42:02.189 --> 01:42:03.730]  Oh, absolutely, yes.
[01:42:04.710 --> 01:42:08.573]  Or the happy, I forget the name of it.
[01:42:09.433 --> 01:42:09.993]  Happies.
[01:42:10.073 --> 01:42:10.414]  Yes.
[01:42:10.514 --> 01:42:11.474]  It's not a sedative.
[01:42:12.035 --> 01:42:17.798]  It's just mild herbs associated with, by every culture that uses them, with being calm.
[01:42:17.838 --> 01:42:24.362]  It's particularly good for children because it's not a depressant, but it's something that I take at night sometimes when I'm too wound up.
[01:42:26.333 --> 01:42:36.920]  It's excellent, but I feel like God did give me this idea about especially people that can't do other things.
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:48.667]  I also tell my children about what's going on, about what the world is like that they're going to grow up in, and I don't want them one day to ask me, but, Grandma, what did you do?
[01:42:49.988 --> 01:42:55.511]  And something as simple as giving $5 faithfully each month
[01:42:56.528 --> 01:42:59.191]  Would just make such a big difference.
[01:42:59.211 --> 01:43:01.054]  Yes ma'am.
[01:43:01.594 --> 01:43:03.697]  2% of the people that visit the site have ever bought anything.
[01:43:04.037 --> 01:43:04.758]  If just 2% more...
[01:43:06.956 --> 01:43:13.019]  And the reason I hate to get to this point, because gosh, five years ago I could make any amount of money I wanted and I would stop plugging when I had enough money.
[01:43:13.059 --> 01:43:14.360]  I wish I had saved a bunch of money.
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:17.182]  But now you've seen what they've done and that's why it's so critical.
[01:43:17.202 --> 01:43:18.402]  So God bless you and I appreciate it.
[01:43:18.642 --> 01:43:22.665]  But your word of mouth, thank you Lillian, your word of mouth is paramount.
[01:43:22.705 --> 01:43:24.165]  That's more important than even buying the product.
[01:43:24.185 --> 01:43:24.646]  So thank you.
[01:43:24.666 --> 01:43:27.427]  But yes, folks, just get your toothpaste, your coffee from InfoWars.
[01:43:28.007 --> 01:43:32.250]  And folks that have never bought anything from us at InfoWarsStore.com will just do that every month.
[01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:37.992]  Then we are sitting pretty to give them one hell of a fight because I've got big plans.
[01:43:38.052 --> 01:43:47.276]  But speaking of one hell of a fight, I like Andrew Torba because he's got a lot of courage and he's a great Silicon Valley programmer who was rising up the ranks at the very top.
[01:43:47.956 --> 01:43:49.817]  He's a very skilled individual.
[01:43:50.217 --> 01:43:53.759]  He set up Gab with massive users.
[01:43:53.799 --> 01:43:55.560]  They've tried to set him up, tried to take him down.
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:57.320]  They always say, build your own thing.
[01:43:57.860 --> 01:43:58.761]  Well, he's done it.
[01:43:59.738 --> 01:44:00.558]  And they're coming after him.
[01:44:00.638 --> 01:44:01.619]  InfoWars is on there.
[01:44:01.639 --> 01:44:07.241]  Well, now they've launched Dissenter, that its own free speech web browser, which is critical.
[01:44:07.661 --> 01:44:14.123]  These Google web browsers, particularly, but the Microsoft ones as well, spy on you and now control what you can see and do.
[01:44:14.623 --> 01:44:19.045]  So I couldn't think of a better time than to have Andrew Torobut launch Dissenter.
[01:44:19.445 --> 01:44:21.626]  And again, this is not an infomercial, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:22.186 --> 01:44:26.510]  I'm doing this because I support everyone else who is supporting freedom.
[01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:29.172]  And so everyone should go download The Center.
[01:44:29.672 --> 01:44:30.193]  It's free.
[01:44:30.593 --> 01:44:31.494]  There's so much more.
[01:44:32.054 --> 01:44:34.356]  People should all get their own social media on Gab.
[01:44:34.716 --> 01:44:36.037]  Thank you for joining us, Andrew.
[01:44:36.317 --> 01:44:37.859]  You haven't been on probably in six months.
[01:44:38.699 --> 01:44:45.444]  And of course you had the firestorm with the guy going into the Jewish Center and shooting people ten seconds after he posted on your site.
[01:44:45.804 --> 01:44:57.073]  When the guy went and shot up Christchurch and then streamed live on Facebook, they didn't blame Zuckerberg, but Zuckerberg and all of them piled on you and wanted you shut down just like Zuckerberg killed Google Chrome.
[01:44:57.193 --> 01:44:58.534]  They don't want any competition.
[01:44:59.921 --> 01:45:00.601]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:45:00.621 --> 01:45:02.282]  You know, you got me worked up here.
[01:45:02.302 --> 01:45:14.386]  I just became a father, so I just had my daughter in July, and it makes this war that much more important to me, and it centers my focus, and God has been working in my life.
[01:45:14.426 --> 01:45:17.367]  God has been working, you know, on Gab.
[01:45:17.387 --> 01:45:22.429]  I like to say God is on Gab, and that's what we have to keep in mind here is that God is on our side.
[01:45:22.869 --> 01:45:28.891]  We are on the side of good, and this really is a spiritual war that we are in, as you say, of good versus evil.
[01:45:29.391 --> 01:45:31.073]  As you mentioned, I was in Silicon Valley.
[01:45:31.113 --> 01:45:32.274]  I was in the belly of the beast.
[01:45:32.354 --> 01:45:40.001]  I was right next to these people and I know how they think and I know what their next move is before they make it and that is something that we've used to our advantage.
[01:45:40.061 --> 01:45:46.748]  So while Gab started off as just trying to be an alternative to Twitter, we are quickly becoming the Silicon Valley alternative.
[01:45:47.468 --> 01:45:55.233]  You know, after last October, after the shooting, we were no platform from payment processors, hosting providers, domain services, you name it, everything.
[01:45:55.313 --> 01:45:59.175]  Probably 30 plus different services, which of course you know all too well yourself.
[01:45:59.636 --> 01:46:04.799]  And we had no choice but to build all of these things from the ground up, including a web browser.
[01:46:05.159 --> 01:46:06.640]  And that's what we've done now with the center.
[01:46:07.912 --> 01:46:12.396]  Let's come back and talk about it, because you've been through the fire, and it's made you stronger.
[01:46:12.456 --> 01:46:15.659]  And if it wasn't for the listeners of this show and others, you would not be there.
[01:46:15.699 --> 01:46:17.300]  But you have been through living hell.
[01:46:18.321 --> 01:46:21.003]  And again, what they've done to you is the model for everyone else.
[01:46:21.023 --> 01:46:24.246]  They're now coming after the NRA with the exact same terrorist tactics.
[01:46:24.566 --> 01:46:26.908]  Ladies and gentlemen, hang together or hang separate.
[01:46:26.928 --> 01:46:29.611]  We'll be back with Andrew Torba, your phone calls and more.
[01:46:30.071 --> 01:46:31.672]  Whatever you do, spread the links.
[01:46:32.313 --> 01:46:33.214]  Ban.video.
[01:46:33.234 --> 01:46:34.435]  Can you feel the energy?
[01:46:37.199 --> 01:46:43.101]  Evil has a hunger and it'll never stop until we stop it.
[01:46:46.401 --> 01:46:48.022]  Look at the Politico headlines.
[01:46:48.982 --> 01:46:53.143]  It feels like a 1776 kind of fight.
[01:46:54.103 --> 01:46:54.463]  It is.
[01:46:54.483 --> 01:46:58.705]  We're going to your phone calls with Andrew Torba, founder of Gab here, but talk about solutions.
[01:46:59.065 --> 01:47:02.286]  I'm going to ask him too what he thinks Trump should do about impeachment and all the rest of it.
[01:47:02.306 --> 01:47:03.866]  But I want to raise this point to you.
[01:47:06.497 --> 01:47:18.689]  Reddit landed $150 million funding from a Chinese Communist government-run operation, and within two months they banned the Donald and froze it.
[01:47:19.970 --> 01:47:22.132]  I happen to know the inside baseball about it all.
[01:47:22.172 --> 01:47:28.318]  I'm not at liberty to tell anybody yet, but I'm working like a little busy beaver to get this to the President.
[01:47:29.319 --> 01:47:30.280]  You talk about criminal.
[01:47:31.789 --> 01:47:36.354]  Now, Torba, and the people he has with him, have been through hell.
[01:47:36.694 --> 01:47:40.658]  I know because I was interviewing him a lot behind the scenes when this stuff went down last year.
[01:47:41.519 --> 01:47:44.082]  And I don't blame some of the folks that were with him, they tapped out.
[01:47:45.483 --> 01:47:49.267]  But he hasn't tapped out, and now he's found folks to go to the next level, and we're going to talk about that.
[01:47:49.287 --> 01:47:54.072]  But I talked to Torba, and I said, hey, let me guess, I bet you've been offered a bunch of money to sell out Gab.
[01:47:54.132 --> 01:47:54.893]  He goes, yeah, of course.
[01:47:55.865 --> 01:47:56.706]  And see, that's the thing.
[01:47:57.206 --> 01:47:58.327]  Not everybody sells out.
[01:47:58.608 --> 01:47:59.509]  There is good in the world.
[01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:06.956]  And when I shot that video yesterday, and we put it out, Learn Who Sold Their Soul to Satan, it's gone viral since.
[01:48:07.797 --> 01:48:14.123]  People are blown away when I show clips of all these Hollywood people saying they sold their soul to the devil, and people like Bob Dylan.
[01:48:16.646 --> 01:48:18.428]  Well, in blues itself,
[01:48:19.488 --> 01:48:21.308]  It's like a form of voodoo.
[01:48:21.328 --> 01:48:22.529]  You're supposed to sell your soul.
[01:48:22.749 --> 01:48:23.629]  So that's the whole point.
[01:48:24.769 --> 01:48:25.369]  That's what he did.
[01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:28.450]  What I'm talking about is really going on.
[01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:36.292]  Whether you believe it's archetypal or whether it's physical or real spirit, these people have signed on to something very bad.
[01:48:38.632 --> 01:48:41.113]  And people are like, oh my gosh, you know.
[01:48:42.918 --> 01:48:44.599]  You turn down $10 million a year.
[01:48:44.619 --> 01:48:45.759]  People say, well, why don't you tell us?
[01:48:45.899 --> 01:48:46.239]  Oh, no one.
[01:48:46.339 --> 01:48:48.240]  You have those agreements with people and it's off record.
[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:49.340]  What they're doing is not criminal.
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:51.461]  And you say, I'm not going to ever talk about this meeting.
[01:48:51.481 --> 01:48:53.022]  I mean, I've signed nondisclosures, you name it.
[01:48:53.882 --> 01:48:58.044]  I mean, I've even signed nondisclosures recently with some of the most powerful people in the world because they wanted to talk to me.
[01:49:00.805 --> 01:49:02.105]  And then I told them, piss up a rope.
[01:49:04.266 --> 01:49:05.306]  And then the pressure came again.
[01:49:06.827 --> 01:49:09.328]  But you need to understand this is real.
[01:49:10.618 --> 01:49:13.099]  And Mark Dice was offered, because I know the people involved.
[01:49:13.379 --> 01:49:13.980]  I called him up.
[01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:16.081]  I said, I heard you're getting the show with these people.
[01:49:17.001 --> 01:49:18.102]  I mean, we mean household names.
[01:49:18.142 --> 01:49:20.443]  He said, no, I wouldn't pledge to Lucifer.
[01:49:21.263 --> 01:49:22.904]  He goes, I used to think you were crazy about that.
[01:49:22.924 --> 01:49:30.127]  They actually asked me, the head of the company, in a boardroom, said, I worship Lucifer, and I want you to hold my hand and pledge to Lucifer, and then we'll give you this big contract.
[01:49:32.668 --> 01:49:33.669]  It's in the game, folks.
[01:49:34.749 --> 01:49:35.730]  I've had them do that to me.
[01:49:35.930 --> 01:49:36.690]  This is real.
[01:49:36.710 --> 01:49:37.791]  OK?
[01:49:38.885 --> 01:49:41.486]  And it's not like they're just trying to keep Christians out of the organization or something.
[01:49:41.626 --> 01:49:42.126]  They mean it.
[01:49:44.086 --> 01:49:44.486]  They mean it.
[01:49:46.747 --> 01:49:49.027]  Corbin, let's go back to you, and I appreciate you joining us from Gab.
[01:49:49.808 --> 01:49:52.608]  You're launching this new incredible browser.
[01:49:52.708 --> 01:49:53.949]  I'm going to load it on everything.
[01:49:54.049 --> 01:49:54.689]  I've been so busy.
[01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:57.990]  I knew you had new stuff going on, and I'm going to get it loaded on everything.
[01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:58.630]  Tell us about it.
[01:49:58.670 --> 01:49:59.410]  Tell us how people get it.
[01:50:00.655 --> 01:50:07.763]  Sure, you go to Decenter.com, D-I-S-S-E-N-T-R, and it is one of the fastest, probably the fastest web browser.
[01:50:07.783 --> 01:50:13.489]  And the reason for that is because we're automatically blocking all of big tech's trackers, all of their ads.
[01:50:14.130 --> 01:50:17.694]  So a lot of the stuff that is slowing down your web browsing is going to be blocked.
[01:50:17.734 --> 01:50:21.939]  And not only that, Alex, the most important thing about Decenter is that it is cutting off
[01:50:22.279 --> 01:50:23.440]  The enemy's funds.
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:33.266]  It's cutting off the enemy's access to your data, which they then turn around and sell for advertisements, which then they make billions of dollars on that you get nothing back in return for.
[01:50:33.686 --> 01:50:36.388]  So that is one of the biggest things is that it's cutting them off.
[01:50:36.628 --> 01:50:38.890]  It's cutting them off their access to your data.
[01:50:39.190 --> 01:50:42.232]  It's cutting off access to them making money off of your browsing history.
[01:50:42.532 --> 01:50:43.293]  So that's number one.
[01:50:43.373 --> 01:50:49.477]  But the second layer of this is that it also has our browser extension built in, which is a free speech comment section.
[01:50:49.557 --> 01:50:49.677]  So
[01:50:50.117 --> 01:50:58.482]  You can go to places like CNN or Fox News or places that have comment sections turned off, and using your Gab account, you can now comment and see what other people are commenting.
[01:50:58.502 --> 01:51:02.944]  And I know when you announced you were building this six months ago, they flipped out and said, should that even be legal?
[01:51:03.344 --> 01:51:05.986]  For them to create a comment section that overlays it?
[01:51:06.046 --> 01:51:06.967]  I mean, how dare them?
[01:51:06.987 --> 01:51:10.328]  Because, again, everybody knows comment section is the most popular thing of any news site.
[01:51:10.649 --> 01:51:14.671]  The fact in the last five years they've been getting rid of them really is them running up the white flag.
[01:51:15.911 --> 01:51:20.672]  Yeah, as soon as we launched this, that's actually when Apple banned our App Store developer account.
[01:51:20.792 --> 01:51:26.214]  We tried submitting the Decentre browser as an iOS app, and it was just a simple web browsing app.
[01:51:26.294 --> 01:51:34.956]  But that's when they said, no, you're getting kicked off of not only rejecting the app, but we're kicking you off as a developer completely so you can no longer submit.
[01:51:35.136 --> 01:51:37.777]  That is pure monopoly behavior textbook example.
[01:51:38.362 --> 01:51:38.762]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:51:38.923 --> 01:51:39.363]  Absolutely.
[01:51:39.783 --> 01:51:40.164]  Absolutely.
[01:51:40.204 --> 01:51:43.366]  No, Apple and Google have a duopoly on mobile app distribution.
[01:51:43.406 --> 01:51:45.488]  They control 98% market share.
[01:51:45.548 --> 01:51:49.251]  So, you know, you have a company like ours that isn't doing anything illegal.
[01:51:49.291 --> 01:51:50.172]  We're following U.S.
[01:51:50.252 --> 01:51:58.299]  law and they won't let us participate in the marketplace because, frankly, we compete with them and we compete with companies that they're partnered with, like Twitter.
[01:51:58.499 --> 01:52:05.064]  You know, I got reminded of this today watching David Knight's show with Harrison Smith, who's really a smart guy.
[01:52:05.084 --> 01:52:07.826]  I mean, everybody's smart around here, but he's really smart for his age.
[01:52:08.407 --> 01:52:10.969]  He brought up the Jones Act that was passed like 40 years ago.
[01:52:11.009 --> 01:52:11.970]  I'd forgotten about this.
[01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:14.151]  You know why we get everything from China?
[01:52:14.572 --> 01:52:16.133]  There's a federal law that U.S.
[01:52:16.213 --> 01:52:17.694]  ships can't dock at a U.S.
[01:52:17.754 --> 01:52:19.515]  port and then go to another U.S.
[01:52:19.575 --> 01:52:20.716]  port if it's for commerce.
[01:52:20.997 --> 01:52:22.298]  They have to go to a foreign port.
[01:52:23.018 --> 01:52:25.280]  It's designed so we don't have any industry.
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:28.502]  I mean, my God, Trump's trying to get rid of the Jones Act right now.
[01:52:29.543 --> 01:52:29.803]  Right.
[01:52:29.903 --> 01:52:31.845]  Yeah, I mean, it's the same thing with big tech, right?
[01:52:31.925 --> 01:52:32.585]  It's all rigged.
[01:52:32.625 --> 01:52:35.207]  There's this facade, this illusion of choice.
[01:52:35.668 --> 01:52:37.149]  Oh, there's, you know, a hundred different apps.
[01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:40.631]  But the reality is, is that they're all owned by two or three companies, right?
[01:52:40.671 --> 01:52:44.674]  So you have Facebook that owns Instagram and WhatsApp and Messenger and all of the top 20 apps.
[01:52:45.815 --> 01:52:50.097]  On the app stores are basically owned by two or three companies and that's one of the reasons why I started cap.
[01:52:50.537 --> 01:52:58.680]  I personally as a consumer just want it choice and you know, we you know, they told they told us to build our own and we did and you see how that worked out.
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:04.382]  We've been no platform from everything and now again and instead of us just being, you know, a social networking alternative.
[01:53:04.402 --> 01:53:06.483]  We're now going to be releasing this browser.
[01:53:06.543 --> 01:53:08.204]  We have an email service coming up.
[01:53:08.844 --> 01:53:10.605]  We had to build our own payments infrastructure.
[01:53:10.685 --> 01:53:23.253]  So, you know, we have everything and ideally we're going to partner and offer this infrastructure with other folks who are also being no platform like yourselves and others and build this ecosystem that can't be touched and cannot be stopped.
[01:53:23.293 --> 01:53:24.894]  That's what we're doing now.
[01:53:25.234 --> 01:53:28.437]  My great crew, hey, we've got to promote Gab.
[01:53:28.477 --> 01:53:30.539]  We've got to promote Telegram and other systems.
[01:53:30.559 --> 01:53:31.380]  We've got to do it right now.
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:38.866]  And I've just been very pleased to see you explode and it seems to get stronger after, you know, it looked like you might have to shut down last year.
[01:53:38.926 --> 01:53:39.707]  How the hell did you do it?
[01:53:39.747 --> 01:53:40.508]  How'd you power through?
[01:53:41.607 --> 01:53:42.047]  It's people.
[01:53:42.307 --> 01:53:43.828]  It's our community, just like you.
[01:53:44.408 --> 01:53:46.949]  We depend on our people, and they make it happen.
[01:53:46.989 --> 01:53:50.110]  They are our investors, they are our customers, they are our donors.
[01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:53.151]  Without them, Gab would have been dead years ago.
[01:53:53.931 --> 01:54:04.315]  Thankfully, we have a very strong core community that keeps Gab going and believes in Gab, believes in me, believes in what we're doing, and knows the importance of what we're doing as well.
[01:54:05.035 --> 01:54:07.957]  We literally have no other choices out there.
[01:54:08.858 --> 01:54:13.340]  It's use Silicon Valley tech or you're not allowed to be a person on the internet.
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:15.242]  You're not allowed to engage in commerce on the internet.
[01:54:15.262 --> 01:54:16.743]  You're not allowed to speak on the internet.
[01:54:16.823 --> 01:54:20.425]  And that's not a world that I want my daughter to grow up in.
[01:54:20.525 --> 01:54:26.649]  I want the internet to be preserved and conserved as the free and open web for all people.
[01:54:26.729 --> 01:54:31.032]  And I want to export American liberties and American values of
[01:54:31.152 --> 01:54:31.593]  1776 worldwide.
[01:54:40.834 --> 01:54:42.235]  Yes, exactly, exactly.
[01:54:42.916 --> 01:54:44.898]  You know, a lot of these things, this is scary, right?
[01:54:44.938 --> 01:54:52.584]  We have New York City this week coming out and saying you're going to get fined $250,000 if you call someone an illegal alien, if you ask them to speak English.
[01:54:52.644 --> 01:54:55.987]  And by the way, I totally forgot to cover that the last three days and I went and read it.
[01:54:56.007 --> 01:54:57.269]  I thought, oh, this is a fake headline.
[01:54:57.629 --> 01:55:05.195]  It says, if our hate board of leftists decide in any way, and they gave examples,
[01:55:06.397 --> 01:55:11.302]  If you kick illegals out because they didn't pay the rent, $250,000 fine!
[01:55:11.843 --> 01:55:14.666]  I mean, this is like the Soviet Union!
[01:55:15.086 --> 01:55:16.628]  And again, it has nothing to do with illegal aliens.
[01:55:16.888 --> 01:55:19.191]  It's all about globalists getting fines in their names.
[01:55:20.464 --> 01:55:22.085]  Right, it's criminalizing speech.
[01:55:22.425 --> 01:55:25.006]  And this is sure to be challenged in the courts.
[01:55:25.127 --> 01:55:29.529]  This is a blatant, flagrant violation of the First Amendment of the United States of America.
[01:55:29.929 --> 01:55:36.353]  And I wouldn't be surprised, Alex, if we see other cities like San Francisco, Chicago, and others start to follow this trend of policing speech.
[01:55:36.373 --> 01:55:37.413]  Oh yeah, it's all written up by the U.N.
[01:55:37.433 --> 01:55:38.274]  and then deployed against us.
[01:55:38.294 --> 01:55:39.314]  It's called munialization.
[01:55:39.334 --> 01:55:40.875]  Stay there, we're going to take some calls, Andrew Dorba.
[01:55:41.255 --> 01:55:47.138]  And folks, he's been busy building all this stuff and busy having a baby with his wonderful wife and finally able to get him back on.
[01:55:47.178 --> 01:55:47.919]  This is awesome.
[01:55:48.459 --> 01:55:53.123]  And I'm telling you, it's so exciting, and we've just all got to get out there and use Gab.
[01:55:53.143 --> 01:55:54.664]  We've got to use Dissenter.
[01:55:54.684 --> 01:55:56.445]  And we'll give you those URLs when we come back.
[01:55:56.465 --> 01:56:03.271]  We're going to go right to your calls, though, because he'll want to talk about how do we stop impeachment or how do we counter how they're trying to openly cause a hot civil war.
[01:56:03.311 --> 01:56:05.653]  I mean, everything we've talked about is now mainstream news.
[01:56:05.693 --> 01:56:06.493]  It's all happening.
[01:56:07.274 --> 01:56:09.236]  But we're not being caught flat-footed.
[01:56:09.876 --> 01:56:12.298]  But I'm telling you, my spidey sense is off the chain right now.
[01:56:12.338 --> 01:56:13.239]  Something big is about to happen.
[01:56:14.844 --> 01:56:15.184]  All right.
[01:56:15.964 --> 01:56:18.165]  Gerald Salente is a heavy hitter, a great guest host.
[01:56:18.205 --> 01:56:23.926]  He understands sometimes I preempt a few segments because I will get to everybody holding.
[01:56:24.186 --> 01:56:29.228]  Mika, Kim, Kirby, Julian, Frank, Antonio, Josh, Bobby, Luke, and Jack before it ends.
[01:56:30.268 --> 01:56:31.868]  We got Andrew Torba of Gab.
[01:56:32.108 --> 01:56:33.149]  He's launched the center.
[01:56:33.249 --> 01:56:34.109]  It's already exploding.
[01:56:34.689 --> 01:56:37.270]  It makes me sleep good at night knowing there's all these other great people out there.
[01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:38.190]  It's absolutely free.
[01:56:38.210 --> 01:56:38.710]  You'll get it today.
[01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.261]  But I want to just say something up front here.
[01:56:42.321 --> 01:56:51.884]  The fact that Gab is still out there, the fact that InfoWars is out there, the fact that Band.Video is out there, the fact that we're still on talk radio enrages the globalists.
[01:56:53.245 --> 01:57:00.187]  And the fact that our talking points that are based purely in reality are now the talking points of Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson, you name it, is incredible.
[01:57:00.788 --> 01:57:05.429]  Now I'm not going to name drop here, it's not bragging, but to show you how effective we are.
[01:57:06.770 --> 01:57:09.331]  This weekend, I talked to not one, not two,
[01:57:10.322 --> 01:57:16.987]  But three different very prominent people that reached out to me just separately.
[01:57:17.968 --> 01:57:29.437]  And it was all the same narrative because they tend to think like I'm the most vanguard of this and they want to know what I think is going on even though these people are very smart and very articulate.
[01:57:30.718 --> 01:57:32.499]  So that just shows you where InfoWars is.
[01:57:34.673 --> 01:57:36.234]  You know Stephen Miller's listening every day.
[01:57:36.454 --> 01:57:40.556]  You know that the president understands what's going on.
[01:57:41.236 --> 01:57:42.017]  And we're still here.
[01:57:42.097 --> 01:57:44.057]  There's not just evil in the world, there's good as well.
[01:57:45.598 --> 01:57:55.203]  Now that said, it's like knowing, like you ever heard like your cousin or someone in your family, you hear about them getting carjacked or robbed and you physically feel pissed?
[01:57:55.603 --> 01:57:57.704]  You feel empathy and you want to hurt who's doing it.
[01:57:59.298 --> 01:58:04.481]  And it'd be one thing if the Democrats were just the old-fashioned corrupt Democrats, and okay, yeah, they're gonna try to steal things.
[01:58:04.981 --> 01:58:09.263]  These people know we're kicking their ass, and they want full control for authoritarianism.
[01:58:09.483 --> 01:58:10.524]  You think stuff's bad now?
[01:58:11.444 --> 01:58:13.645]  I'm physically in total fight mode.
[01:58:13.665 --> 01:58:14.706]  I'm not gonna do anything physical.
[01:58:15.146 --> 01:58:23.310]  But intellectually, my brain has done the math, I've looked at it, and I can't help my brain now not going into combat mode.
[01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:24.731]  Doesn't mean I'm gonna do anything, I'm not.
[01:58:25.657 --> 01:58:27.978]  They're starting combat mode because they're losing the info war.
[01:58:28.218 --> 01:58:29.339]  But I'm here to tell you, folks.
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:34.702]  I've been on air 25 years, and you could take 25 of the years.
[01:58:34.842 --> 01:58:37.644]  They don't compete with what's happening now, energetically.
[01:58:39.245 --> 01:58:39.625]  Woo!
[01:58:40.025 --> 01:58:40.966]  I mean, man.
[01:58:41.926 --> 01:58:44.688]  And I'm telling you, they're doing some bad stuff right now, folks.
[01:58:47.389 --> 01:58:50.151]  But it's all going to come out, and it's going to be one hell of a fight.
[01:58:50.231 --> 01:58:51.532]  And in the end, we're going to win this thing.
[01:58:52.372 --> 01:58:53.653]  The devil only rules for one hour.
[01:58:56.394 --> 01:58:58.495]  Corba, I want to go to these calls with you for a couple of seconds.
[01:58:58.515 --> 01:58:58.895]  We've got to go.
[01:58:58.915 --> 01:59:00.235]  I understand you're on a tight schedule.
[01:59:00.695 --> 01:59:01.595]  We're just in closing.
[01:59:01.615 --> 01:59:02.836]  Please come back soon for a full hour.
[01:59:04.836 --> 01:59:06.156]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:59:06.777 --> 01:59:08.777]  What would you call this period of history we're in right now?
[01:59:09.637 --> 01:59:16.579]  And I just, I mean, you're doing a lot, and I know I'm doing a lot, and the listeners are doing a lot, but I just feel like we should do more.
[01:59:17.179 --> 01:59:19.280]  What would you call this period of time, and what do you think Trump should do?
[01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:19.760]  What should we do?
[01:59:21.947 --> 01:59:27.092]  We are in a war for the soul of this country, and in a war for freedom.
[01:59:27.533 --> 01:59:28.914]  And this is a spiritual war.
[01:59:29.455 --> 01:59:31.076]  We need to pray, first and foremost.
[01:59:31.857 --> 01:59:32.658]  Get closer to God.
[01:59:32.758 --> 01:59:33.258]  Go to church.
[01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:36.181]  Bring God into your family.
[01:59:36.301 --> 01:59:36.962]  That's number one.
[01:59:36.982 --> 01:59:41.947]  Because that's how we're going to be stable and secure with our actions going forward.
[01:59:42.487 --> 01:59:53.176]  So number two is we need to wake people up who are sleepwalking through history, and we need to have empathy and understand that a lot of them are just going about their day-to-day day.
[01:59:53.256 --> 01:59:54.256]  Maybe they don't watch the news.
[01:59:54.276 --> 01:59:57.379]  They're not following on what's going on in politics or what's happening with
[01:59:57.839 --> 02:00:01.000]  These Silicon Valley tyrants silencing people on the internet.
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:07.022]  But just educate them and have an open conversation and wake people up one by one and that's how we're going to win.
[02:00:07.602 --> 02:00:12.504]  As far as this impeachment stuff, I think it's ultimately going to play into Trump's hand.
[02:00:12.944 --> 02:00:14.404]  The Democrats are clearly desperate.
[02:00:14.904 --> 02:00:18.505]  You look at any of the candidates that they have, you watch these debates and it's like a clown show.
[02:00:18.926 --> 02:00:21.806]  Not one person on that stage is going to beat Trump.
[02:00:22.186 --> 02:00:24.247]  Andrew, let me give you the bad equation though.
[02:00:24.307 --> 02:00:24.967]  I agree with you 100%.
[02:00:25.007 --> 02:00:25.287]  100% you're right.
[02:00:28.328 --> 02:00:31.892]  But they've got the votes in the House, and they can twist out of the Senate.
[02:00:32.132 --> 02:00:33.394]  They think they're getting rid of him.
[02:00:33.414 --> 02:00:35.676]  And I agree with you, it's making Trump stronger.
[02:00:35.696 --> 02:00:36.978]  That's why this is so explosive.
[02:00:37.538 --> 02:00:40.402]  I mean, this is the immovable object runs into the unstoppable force.
[02:00:41.385 --> 02:00:42.506]  Right, right, exactly.
[02:00:42.526 --> 02:00:44.227]  I don't think he's going to get impeached.
[02:00:44.267 --> 02:00:45.168]  I think they're going to try.
[02:00:45.328 --> 02:00:49.451]  And again, it's only going to play into his hand with this anti-establishment narrative.
[02:00:49.771 --> 02:00:57.417]  Because now, once again, just like during the 2016 election, he's up against the establishment of Congress and the establishment of Beltway, D.C.
[02:00:58.077 --> 02:00:59.298]  and the establishment media.
[02:00:59.718 --> 02:01:00.839]  And he's winning, right?
[02:01:01.159 --> 02:01:03.221]  And things are coming out and proving that he's right.
[02:01:03.241 --> 02:01:05.963]  That's why they're in panic mode, but that's what makes him so dangerous.
[02:01:06.917 --> 02:01:07.798]  Right, exactly.
[02:01:08.058 --> 02:01:09.720]  And this is why speech is so important, too.
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:12.723]  And this is why they're cracking down, is because people are getting the truth out.
[02:01:13.063 --> 02:01:14.945]  People aren't reliant on the media anymore.
[02:01:15.226 --> 02:01:20.311]  They're getting their information from other sources, from individuals, from places like Infowars, from places like Gab.
[02:01:20.831 --> 02:01:22.533]  And isn't that the good news?
[02:01:22.553 --> 02:01:27.939]  That whether it's Thornburg, or whether it's Trudeau, everything they do falls on its face.
[02:01:29.158 --> 02:01:29.918]  Well, yeah, of course.
[02:01:29.978 --> 02:01:34.761]  I mean, all these people have skeletons in their closet, and it's just inevitable that it eventually comes out.
[02:01:35.341 --> 02:01:37.702]  And this is karma, and this is God at work, right?
[02:01:37.722 --> 02:01:39.963]  A lot of Democrats are liberals, even in Europe.
[02:01:39.983 --> 02:01:41.183]  They're constantly in blackface.
[02:01:41.243 --> 02:01:42.324]  I've never been in blackface.
[02:01:43.324 --> 02:01:43.805]  Never, yeah.
[02:01:43.905 --> 02:01:45.185]  No, I don't understand it.
[02:01:45.205 --> 02:01:46.286]  You'd think that they would understand.
[02:01:46.346 --> 02:01:53.389]  And, you know, some of the people that project anti-racism or social justice ironically end up being the most racist people, right?
[02:01:53.449 --> 02:01:57.631]  Oh, I never heard the N-word until I was in college.
[02:01:58.371 --> 02:01:59.611]  And then I went on road trips.
[02:01:59.671 --> 02:02:00.972]  And Northerners are great.
[02:02:01.052 --> 02:02:01.712]  Most wonderful people.
[02:02:01.732 --> 02:02:04.432]  But I mean, that's when I heard N-word and stuff was in the North.
[02:02:04.452 --> 02:02:06.453]  And I'm just, I mean, the people in the South?
[02:02:07.133 --> 02:02:08.653]  Get your ass killed doing that, man.
[02:02:09.033 --> 02:02:10.474]  I mean, people don't play games down here.
[02:02:10.514 --> 02:02:13.854]  I mean, I never heard anybody talk bad about black people.
[02:02:14.334 --> 02:02:17.695]  I mean, you know, because we're Christians and we don't put people down to make ourselves bigger.
[02:02:17.735 --> 02:02:21.296]  And it's just this idea of the South's a bunch of racists is a load of crap.
[02:02:22.483 --> 02:02:23.103]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:02:23.143 --> 02:02:33.527]  I mean, if you're a Christian, if you're a straight white male, if you're, you know, someone who's off the plantation or the Democrat plantation or thinking for yourself, you know, you're going to get attacked.
[02:02:33.547 --> 02:02:34.467]  You're going to get smeared.
[02:02:34.527 --> 02:02:36.388]  And we are the great oppressors.
[02:02:36.488 --> 02:02:40.449]  But, you know, the reality is, is that we're the ones that are speaking the truth, right?
[02:02:40.549 --> 02:02:42.992]  We're speaking truth to power, and we're winning.
[02:02:43.192 --> 02:02:47.698]  And again, like I said earlier, we have God on our side, so no matter what happens, we can't lose.
[02:02:47.778 --> 02:02:50.602]  But, you know, I get emotional, too, now that I'm a father.
[02:02:51.002 --> 02:02:52.805]  This stuff is so crucial.
[02:02:53.285 --> 02:02:55.408]  What happened once you saw that baby?
[02:02:57.030 --> 02:02:58.432]  Some switches got thrown, didn't they?
[02:02:59.363 --> 02:03:00.284]  Big time, big time.
[02:03:00.504 --> 02:03:04.768]  And just like you said, you know, I went into full-on, you know, fight or flight.
[02:03:04.848 --> 02:03:05.549]  It's time.
[02:03:05.949 --> 02:03:06.730]  This is the time.
[02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:07.971]  We have to rise now.
[02:03:08.011 --> 02:03:13.316]  We have to fight back against this because we're going to wake up one day and we're not going to be able to say anything on the internet.
[02:03:13.336 --> 02:03:15.418]  We're not going to be able to open a bank account.
[02:03:16.078 --> 02:03:18.240]  You know, the mark of the beast stuff is coming.
[02:03:19.001 --> 02:03:24.265]  And, you know, we better be prepared for it and we better have alternative infrastructure in place for before that happens.
[02:03:24.326 --> 02:03:25.707]  And that's why they taught the rapture.
[02:03:26.948 --> 02:03:28.589]  Any fool could read Revelation.
[02:03:29.169 --> 02:03:31.311]  Christ comes back, then the dead of Christ are risen.
[02:03:31.471 --> 02:03:33.892]  Then there's a thousand years of Christ, and it all makes perfect sense.
[02:03:34.273 --> 02:03:35.173]  Now there's a world government.
[02:03:35.734 --> 02:03:37.595]  The world government takes over for a little while.
[02:03:38.215 --> 02:03:41.177]  A day, an hour, and in time it's probably not even like a year.
[02:03:41.417 --> 02:03:45.160]  They're gonna get their total AI hell system, and then it's all gonna fall!
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:46.741]  It's all gonna get powered down.
[02:03:46.801 --> 02:03:47.902]  It's all gonna get wiped out.
[02:03:48.162 --> 02:03:50.884]  And so these churches and everybody are thinking they're gonna get raptured.
[02:03:51.124 --> 02:03:52.845]  It's not in the Bible!
[02:03:53.165 --> 02:03:53.926]  It's a lie!
[02:03:54.906 --> 02:03:57.487]  Well, the other thing too is that there are multiple Antichrists, right?
[02:03:57.527 --> 02:03:57.987]  And they're here.
[02:03:58.007 --> 02:03:59.427]  Spirit of Antichrist, yes.
[02:03:59.487 --> 02:04:00.107]  Many Antichrists.
[02:04:00.147 --> 02:04:00.287]  Right.
[02:04:01.167 --> 02:04:01.588]  Exactly.
[02:04:01.628 --> 02:04:04.568]  And who's to say that the AI isn't Antichrist, right?
[02:04:04.808 --> 02:04:05.829]  And that's what their ultimate goal is.
[02:04:05.849 --> 02:04:06.749]  Well, that's the image of the beast.
[02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.529]  Exactly.
[02:04:07.829 --> 02:04:22.492]  Yeah, that's their ultimate goal is to have us all policed and, you know, controlled with this AI, using the data that they have to control what we can say, what we can share, who can engage in commerce, what is news, what isn't, you know, who you're supposed to vote for, who you're not supposed to vote for.
[02:04:22.513 --> 02:04:24.513]  And if not, then your life is going to be destroyed.
[02:04:24.853 --> 02:04:29.519]  You're not going to be able to make any money, you're not going to be able to get a job, you're not going to be able to have a presence on the internet.
[02:04:29.859 --> 02:04:31.982]  That is totalitarian control.
[02:04:34.921 --> 02:04:37.062]  No, I was just going to say the only way that we beat it is by building.
[02:04:37.682 --> 02:04:38.702]  We can't rely on government.
[02:04:38.763 --> 02:04:41.884]  We can't rely on, you know, anyone to come and save us.
[02:04:41.924 --> 02:04:43.004]  We have to save ourselves.
[02:04:43.044 --> 02:04:45.105]  And the only way that we save ourselves is by building.
[02:04:45.405 --> 02:04:47.546]  And that's exactly what we've been doing for three years now.
[02:04:47.586 --> 02:04:49.827]  And that's exactly what we're going to continue to do going forward.
[02:04:49.867 --> 02:04:51.948]  It's what you've been doing for 25 plus years as well.
[02:04:52.368 --> 02:04:52.748]  Exactly.
[02:04:52.788 --> 02:04:56.429]  So again, where do people go to download the browser?
[02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:58.690]  Decentre.com.
[02:04:58.830 --> 02:05:00.611]  And of course, get on Gab, Gab.com.
[02:05:01.011 --> 02:05:02.852]  All right, Andrew, thank you so much for the time.
[02:05:02.892 --> 02:05:03.332]  God bless you.
[02:05:04.363 --> 02:05:04.663]  Thank you.
[02:05:04.683 --> 02:05:05.224]  God bless, Alex.
[02:05:28.874 --> 02:05:30.736]  I guarantee you, it's all happening, just get ready.
[02:05:31.537 --> 02:05:33.899]  And you can see it, and you know it, and there's no doubt about it.
[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:39.164]  And I'm just going to tell everybody, if you climb under the bed, they're going to dig your ass out of there.
[02:05:40.085 --> 02:05:45.971]  We're going to ride out, we're going to face these people politically, and we're going to have victory, the likes of which we've never seen.
[02:05:46.512 --> 02:05:49.475]  Then there's going to be a long AI takeover after that.
[02:05:51.411 --> 02:05:54.252]  But this is getting the groundwork to go through the next big challenge.
[02:05:54.552 --> 02:06:00.693]  Once we've beaten these little globalists, we're going to look at the next level we've got to face and go, man, wow, we wish we had them as enemies.
[02:06:01.573 --> 02:06:03.353]  I'm telling you, I've foreseen it.
[02:06:03.513 --> 02:06:04.014]  I've studied it.
[02:06:04.154 --> 02:06:04.994]  I know it's going to happen.
[02:06:05.254 --> 02:06:06.394]  It's going to be rough, folks.
[02:06:06.914 --> 02:06:10.875]  But on the other side of this is going to be real human potential.
[02:06:10.915 --> 02:06:16.896]  You look at how far we've come in our species and where we're at now, just a few more inches and we are, I mean, it is amazing.
[02:06:17.176 --> 02:06:20.137]  But you don't get all that power without being tested.
[02:06:21.284 --> 02:06:24.485]  And the power we're going to be given, we're going to throw it back at God and say, we don't want this.
[02:06:25.405 --> 02:06:32.748]  I mean, it's amazing, but you cannot be given more power than Satan ever imagined if you haven't been tested.
[02:06:33.648 --> 02:06:35.469]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back on the other side.
[02:06:35.509 --> 02:06:37.910]  Please don't forget, Black Friday has come two months early.
[02:06:38.450 --> 02:06:42.091]  Storewide free shipping, 50% off all the supplements and more, and double Patreon points.
[02:06:42.351 --> 02:06:43.512]  Without you, we'll be shut down.
[02:06:43.532 --> 02:06:44.632]  With your help, we will dominate.
[02:06:46.058 --> 02:06:47.279]  All right, we're taking your phone calls.
[02:06:47.339 --> 02:06:51.683]  I really appreciate folks holding, but we got 20-something phone lines, so it's a catch-22 to get on.
[02:06:51.703 --> 02:06:53.804]  Sometimes you gotta hold over an hour, and I apologize.
[02:06:53.824 --> 02:06:58.608]  We're gonna go to Frank, and then Julie, and Kirby, and everybody.
[02:06:59.489 --> 02:07:00.850]  Frank, thanks for holding from Georgia.
[02:07:00.870 --> 02:07:01.811]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:07:03.092 --> 02:07:03.892]  Alex, you're a patriot.
[02:07:03.932 --> 02:07:04.473]  You're awesome.
[02:07:04.633 --> 02:07:08.916]  The one thing we could do, as a minimum, is stay vocal for our support for Trump.
[02:07:09.257 --> 02:07:09.957]  We can't hide it.
[02:07:10.938 --> 02:07:13.160]  Additionally, use Gap, not Facebook.
[02:07:13.300 --> 02:07:14.040]  Don't use Chrome.
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:14.701]  Get to center.
[02:07:15.359 --> 02:07:20.384]  I mean, could you imagine if you had a pervert mailman that read all your mail and then stole your information?
[02:07:20.404 --> 02:07:21.305]  It's ridiculous.
[02:07:21.885 --> 02:07:23.206]  Oh, you'd be pissed!
[02:07:23.627 --> 02:07:27.070]  But because you opt in to the Roach Motel, people think it's okay.
[02:07:28.191 --> 02:07:28.672]  Absolutely.
[02:07:28.692 --> 02:07:32.475]  I mean, everyone listening right now should text five people the link to Bandot Video.
[02:07:33.276 --> 02:07:33.776]  Seriously.
[02:07:34.397 --> 02:07:36.099]  I mean, the word can spread fast.
[02:07:36.359 --> 02:07:37.320]  We just have to take action.
[02:07:38.459 --> 02:07:40.841]  By the way, I was talking to Kaitlin Bennett last night.
[02:07:41.421 --> 02:07:48.265]  She doesn't get my BandDot video text on her Droid Galaxy 7, or Galaxy 10, excuse me.
[02:07:49.306 --> 02:07:50.927]  And I started talking to other people.
[02:07:50.967 --> 02:07:52.328]  They're not getting BandDot video.
[02:07:52.628 --> 02:07:58.512]  And that's the new thing they say is they're going to block it at the browser level in the phones, in the operating system.
[02:07:58.572 --> 02:08:01.994]  So, folks, they're getting ready to make their move.
[02:08:02.034 --> 02:08:02.855]  That's all I can say.
[02:08:02.935 --> 02:08:04.256]  And we have a chance to stop it.
[02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:08.733]  That's why I'm desperate to try to figure out what it is we do to reverse it.
[02:08:09.013 --> 02:08:09.754]  And I think you're right.
[02:08:10.194 --> 02:08:13.177]  They're trying to intimidate Trump and people around him to think he's going to lose.
[02:08:13.577 --> 02:08:14.818]  We have to swarm DC.
[02:08:14.858 --> 02:08:23.446]  But instead of always swarming, you know, the mall and then nobody covers it, the halls of the Senate and the House, you go right through, you go right to their damn offices.
[02:08:24.006 --> 02:08:26.949]  Get in there and get in their faces in a legal and lawful way.
[02:08:28.806 --> 02:08:29.246]  Anything else?
[02:08:29.346 --> 02:08:29.727]  Frank?
[02:08:30.527 --> 02:08:30.967]  Oh, yes, sir.
[02:08:31.768 --> 02:08:35.690]  Trump's going toe-to-toe with these bloodthirsty anti-American globalists.
[02:08:35.710 --> 02:08:42.513]  The least we can do to fight these Epsteins, these Ed Bucks, these Bidens, these Zuckerbergs, is support animal wars, support local business.
[02:08:42.793 --> 02:08:48.917]  I can tell you firsthand that as an antibacterial, antiviral, the X2 is as effective on animals as it is on people.
[02:08:49.337 --> 02:08:50.638]  My family and I went on vacation.
[02:08:50.698 --> 02:08:51.438]  We had to board our dog.
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:52.540]  God bless you.
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:57.943]  You know, I don't want to say iodine is a miracle, but if you don't have water in the desert and you find an oasis and get a bunch of water, it's a miracle.
[02:08:58.283 --> 02:08:58.984]  You die without iodine.
[02:08:59.004 --> 02:09:01.265]  There's almost none of it in the soil.
[02:09:19.363 --> 02:09:20.905]  What's in the ocean is contaminated.
[02:09:21.085 --> 02:09:21.966]  Still better than nothing.
[02:09:22.907 --> 02:09:24.869]  We have pure, real atomic iodine.
[02:09:24.909 --> 02:09:30.034]  And by the way, nobody else goes out and goes to the DEA to get it and have it DEA-stored in a facility.
[02:09:30.094 --> 02:09:31.515]  I'd go to the top lab in the country.
[02:09:31.536 --> 02:09:33.538]  Everybody else just says they have atomic.
[02:09:33.598 --> 02:09:34.098]  No they don't!
[02:09:34.318 --> 02:09:34.839]  No they don't!
[02:09:35.059 --> 02:09:35.560]  No they don't!
[02:09:36.581 --> 02:09:39.163]  If you take regular iodine, it'll eat a whole damn hole in your stomach.
[02:09:39.484 --> 02:09:40.825]  Because it's bound to a bunch of crap.
[02:09:40.865 --> 02:09:41.546]  It's not iodine.
[02:09:43.218 --> 02:09:49.003]  And again, it freaks me out, folks, that we've been selling this seven years and that nobody went out and did it.
[02:09:49.063 --> 02:09:50.144]  I'm telling you how you do it.
[02:09:51.706 --> 02:09:53.087]  Nobody else goes out and does it.
[02:09:53.127 --> 02:09:56.230]  Nobody else goes to the oil companies and gets it from 12,000 feet.
[02:09:56.290 --> 02:09:57.891]  Nobody goes to the DEA paperwork.
[02:09:58.271 --> 02:09:58.612]  We did.
[02:09:59.853 --> 02:10:00.173]  We did.
[02:10:00.854 --> 02:10:01.895]  Let's go to another caller here.
[02:10:01.915 --> 02:10:03.716]  He's been holding the longest now.
[02:10:03.776 --> 02:10:06.298]  Kim, thanks for holding your ear on the air from Arkansas.
[02:10:06.338 --> 02:10:06.759]  Thank you, Kim.
[02:10:08.033 --> 02:10:09.254]  Yes Alex, thank you.
[02:10:09.314 --> 02:10:12.997]  I think there's been a special anointing on today's show.
[02:10:13.078 --> 02:10:14.259]  I think we all sense it.
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:17.281]  Let me tell you sir, absolutely.
[02:10:18.042 --> 02:10:20.764]  This whole weekend, just God is moving.
[02:10:20.784 --> 02:10:21.284]  Can you feel it?
[02:10:22.125 --> 02:10:24.587]  He really is and that's the purpose of my call.
[02:10:24.627 --> 02:10:25.328]  It's interesting.
[02:10:25.368 --> 02:10:31.033]  I've been trying to reach out to you for several months and Lillian has said it all.
[02:10:33.395 --> 02:10:33.595]  Alex,
[02:10:34.748 --> 02:10:37.049]  You're a modern-day Apostle Paul.
[02:10:37.269 --> 02:10:39.449]  You're fighting the same fight he fought.
[02:10:39.509 --> 02:10:42.890]  You understand, as he did, our real enemy.
[02:10:43.590 --> 02:10:51.152]  You always, every show, you mention our God and Savior and Jesus Christ as our only solution.
[02:10:52.352 --> 02:10:59.214]  You should—you're obligated, Alex, to ask for contributions
[02:11:00.123 --> 02:11:09.569]  That would be graciously given if you would set up an organized way so that we your listeners, millions of Christians around the world,
[02:11:10.703 --> 02:11:13.625]  Those that are conservative, we would support you.
[02:11:13.826 --> 02:11:15.427]  Well stay there, let's come back and talk about that.
[02:11:15.927 --> 02:11:21.932]  And Trump's taking some of the heat off of it, but you do a 501 whatever and then they can control what you do, but yes we need to do it.
[02:11:22.452 --> 02:11:26.675]  And listen, just as we get deeper into this, I've always been a Christian, now it's totally obvious, you can see it.
[02:11:26.976 --> 02:11:28.377]  The devil's real, God's real.
[02:11:28.737 --> 02:11:35.382]  They're killing children after they're born now, so people are all, look at Kanye West has found Christ.
[02:11:36.203 --> 02:11:36.963]  It's going to happen.
[02:11:36.983 --> 02:11:38.765]  You're going to join Satan or you're going to join God?
[02:11:42.776 --> 02:11:47.279]  We could definitely set up just a pro-Christ, pro-free speech organization.
[02:11:47.939 --> 02:11:50.560]  I'm never like a Pharisee trying to claim I'm Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:51.561]  I have my problems.
[02:11:51.601 --> 02:11:52.141]  I get angry.
[02:11:52.902 --> 02:11:54.643]  But this is a good versus evil fight.
[02:11:54.723 --> 02:11:57.464]  And you don't see most of the churches actually getting into what's happening.
[02:11:58.245 --> 02:11:59.345]  Prophecy being fulfilled.
[02:11:59.385 --> 02:12:00.126]  It's all happening.
[02:12:00.166 --> 02:12:00.786]  It's all real.
[02:12:01.166 --> 02:12:02.847]  The Satanists, the whole nine yards.
[02:12:03.788 --> 02:12:05.629]  And so the caller's right.
[02:12:07.537 --> 02:12:12.701]  People either need to find a church that's fighting the New World Order, or they need to donate to something like InfoWars.
[02:12:13.241 --> 02:12:22.088]  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[02:12:22.128 --> 02:12:29.034]  You can go on basically, you know, talking about in the cosmos, in space, this evil, you know, the prince power of the air.
[02:12:29.054 --> 02:12:31.296]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[02:12:31.616 --> 02:12:32.777]  And it's very, very real.
[02:12:34.594 --> 02:12:36.516]  It wants your children for eternity.
[02:12:37.177 --> 02:12:39.359]  So Kim, what else do you think Trump needs to do?
[02:12:39.379 --> 02:12:40.380]  What do you think is about to happen?
[02:12:41.551 --> 02:12:50.153]  First of all, Alex, nobody says it better than you, including 99% of the pastors in this country, okay?
[02:12:50.473 --> 02:12:52.973]  Nobody says it clearer than you do.
[02:12:53.493 --> 02:12:55.393]  I think we're in the kingdom of God.
[02:12:55.833 --> 02:12:58.854]  I think Trump is going to be victorious.
[02:12:58.994 --> 02:13:01.875]  I think the American people are going to be victorious.
[02:13:02.315 --> 02:13:07.315]  I know Christians will be victorious, and that's why you need us behind you.
[02:13:07.736 --> 02:13:10.016]  We need to be giving to your
[02:13:10.956 --> 02:13:21.145]  Efforts on a monthly basis, a commitment, a commitment to your ministry, and we will definitely defeat Satan.
[02:13:22.106 --> 02:13:35.071]  I'll say Trump definitely used to be worldly.
[02:13:35.091 --> 02:13:37.952]  But like he said, he's changed and I know people that know him well.
[02:13:38.332 --> 02:13:39.793]  Trump really has seen some things.
[02:13:39.833 --> 02:13:40.733]  God's used Trump.
[02:13:41.053 --> 02:13:42.514]  And that's what the Bible shows in history.
[02:13:42.654 --> 02:13:44.775]  God doesn't usually pick some perfect goody two-shoes.
[02:13:45.115 --> 02:13:46.376]  God picks all sorts of people.
[02:13:46.436 --> 02:13:46.896]  God bless you.
[02:13:46.916 --> 02:13:47.636]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:48.396 --> 02:13:49.737]  I just want to get back to this.
[02:13:51.277 --> 02:13:56.441]  If you go out to Democratic events or you go behind the scenes with them and you get around Hollywood, they're a bunch of devil worshippers.
[02:13:57.202 --> 02:13:58.083]  They're not atheists.
[02:13:58.523 --> 02:14:01.165]  They tell you they're atheists because they don't want you to know there's a spirit world.
[02:14:01.586 --> 02:14:02.266]  It's real, folks.
[02:14:02.326 --> 02:14:03.768]  We only see a limited amount.
[02:14:04.008 --> 02:14:06.850]  Can you guys queue up from yesterday, Bob Dylan on 60 Minutes?
[02:14:09.933 --> 02:14:11.814]  And he's in larger interviews talking about it.
[02:14:12.635 --> 02:14:19.741]  And again, folks, here's a clip of Bob Dylan talking about making a deal with the devil.
[02:14:20.802 --> 02:14:22.162]  Are you still out here doing these songs?
[02:14:22.322 --> 02:14:23.623]  You know, you're still on tour.
[02:14:24.783 --> 02:14:26.524]  I do, but I don't take it for granted.
[02:14:27.464 --> 02:14:28.324]  Why do you still do it?
[02:14:28.404 --> 02:14:29.284]  Why are you still out here?
[02:14:29.784 --> 02:14:31.845]  Well, it goes back to that Destiny thing.
[02:14:31.865 --> 02:14:39.347]  You know, I made a bargain with it, you know, a long time ago, and I'm holding up my hand.
[02:14:40.227 --> 02:14:41.167]  What was your bargain?
[02:14:41.608 --> 02:14:42.228]  To get where?
[02:14:45.772 --> 02:14:49.674]  Should I ask who you made the bargain with?
[02:14:49.954 --> 02:14:52.655]  With the chief commander.
[02:14:53.195 --> 02:14:53.796]  On this earth?
[02:14:54.296 --> 02:14:57.657]  On this earth and in a world we can't see.
[02:15:11.443 --> 02:15:17.884]  I'm personally not going to get into all this, because it's so fantastical, it just sounds like a movie.
[02:15:18.624 --> 02:15:30.626]  But let me tell you, the stuff you see in movies is from real stuff, and the devil isn't omnipresent like God, but the devil can follow families and groups and people and knows, and understands potentials of individuals.
[02:15:31.106 --> 02:15:37.787]  And I had, like I told you in Dallas, real Satanists, not your folks killing their dog in the back of the trailer park.
[02:15:38.448 --> 02:15:40.168]  The real thing tried to recruit me, okay?
[02:15:40.948 --> 02:15:41.549]  The real deal.
[02:15:42.611 --> 02:15:51.886]  And so, I realize all along my life, as all of our lives, has been training and preparation so that when the real weight gets put on me, I don't think I'm gonna falter.
[02:15:53.061 --> 02:15:55.462]  And, you know, that's really what this is.
[02:15:55.582 --> 02:15:56.822]  And that's it.
[02:15:57.202 --> 02:15:58.382]  I mean, the devil's real.
[02:15:58.923 --> 02:16:02.504]  It's a fallen entity on this planet, trying to destroy us before we go to the next level.
[02:16:02.824 --> 02:16:06.285]  And once you think of it from a science fiction perspective, it's like, oh, that makes perfect sense.
[02:16:06.765 --> 02:16:11.206]  You think of this big universe, this awesome planet, and our awesome species isn't going to get fed on?
[02:16:12.486 --> 02:16:14.067]  And by the way, the globalists all believe that.
[02:16:14.107 --> 02:16:15.447]  They just think they're working with the winner.
[02:16:15.647 --> 02:16:16.887]  They're like, hey, you're this entity?
[02:16:17.188 --> 02:16:18.348]  You bet we'll do whatever you say.
[02:16:19.482 --> 02:16:20.343]  Piss on Satan!
[02:16:20.543 --> 02:16:22.484]  I am not gonna be serving this creature!
[02:16:23.285 --> 02:16:24.266]  It's real, okay?
[02:16:24.646 --> 02:16:26.408]  It's a frickin' space alien, man!
[02:16:26.828 --> 02:16:28.129]  And it's all right there!
[02:16:28.149 --> 02:16:31.051]  A fallen creature!
[02:16:31.332 --> 02:16:32.633]  He can't even get off the planet!
[02:16:33.473 --> 02:16:35.435]  But he sure knows how to screw us up, doesn't he?
[02:16:37.256 --> 02:16:39.298]  It's all right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:39.518 --> 02:16:40.299]  It's all right there.
[02:16:40.439 --> 02:16:41.060]  It's all real.
[02:16:44.662 --> 02:16:46.124]  Alright, who's been holding along us now?
[02:16:47.637 --> 02:16:48.998]  Luke in Texas, thanks for holding.
[02:16:49.159 --> 02:16:49.639]  Go ahead, Luke.
[02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:52.141]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:16:52.502 --> 02:16:53.262]  Good to talk to you.
[02:16:53.282 --> 02:16:57.887]  I've been a listener since I was 11, so about 10 years now.
[02:16:58.187 --> 02:17:02.271]  And I just want to start saying your products are amazing.
[02:17:02.351 --> 02:17:03.372]  Thank you.
[02:17:04.593 --> 02:17:11.260]  I take the iodine, fish oil, krill oil, vitamin mineral fusion doesn't get talked about enough.
[02:17:13.171 --> 02:17:14.692]  Just lots of great stuff.
[02:17:15.412 --> 02:17:20.375]  Well, most supplements weren't really good because supplements are amazing things out of medicine chests that God gave us.
[02:17:20.695 --> 02:17:22.757]  We just go give you the strongest, the best.
[02:17:24.037 --> 02:17:26.459]  And, you know, the whole supplement industry has come a long way.
[02:17:26.479 --> 02:17:33.363]  30, 40 years ago, with people like Winder and Schwarzenegger, in my view, were, you know, running some pretty big scams on people with fillers and crap.
[02:17:33.763 --> 02:17:37.985]  But in general, supplements and things are really kick-ass nowadays, and ours are the very best, so thank you, sir.
[02:17:39.226 --> 02:17:39.666]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:40.107 --> 02:17:42.408]  I just wanted to call in and
[02:17:43.021 --> 02:17:45.604]  Oh yeah, anybody can just walk up to a group of leftists
[02:18:04.704 --> 02:18:05.104]  Yes, sir.
[02:18:05.124 --> 02:18:07.725]  We just need to get out there, be vigilant, like you said.
[02:18:34.708 --> 02:18:39.895]  They will, but Trump needs to have the Justice Department go after these people.
[02:18:39.935 --> 02:18:42.257]  They know that the indictments are there.
[02:18:42.277 --> 02:18:43.679]  That's confirmed.
[02:18:53.527 --> 02:18:53.707]  Hey, Alex.
[02:19:22.392 --> 02:19:25.194]  I've been born and raised here in the belly of the beast over in New York City.
[02:19:25.374 --> 02:19:26.254]  I'm a Hispanic man.
[02:19:26.274 --> 02:19:31.077]  I was born to be, you know, proud of myself and then taught to be a victim after that.
[02:19:31.678 --> 02:19:38.062]  First woke up with your work with Jason Burmiss and Blue Change 9-11 because people here were really from New York.
[02:19:38.582 --> 02:19:40.623]  They really, really were affected by that even to this day.
[02:19:40.983 --> 02:19:46.206]  And then I became a supporter of you right after I realized Obama was fake and purchased your stuff.
[02:19:46.326 --> 02:19:49.889]  I had the first bottle of Survival Shield and now I have a subscription to
[02:19:50.834 --> 02:19:53.036]  Let's see, about 10 or 11 products in here.
[02:19:53.096 --> 02:19:55.598]  So thank you very much for all that.
[02:19:55.718 --> 02:20:05.425]  The reason why I bring that up is because I work in nightlife and I'm constantly around both the, you know, people who grew up in the city and the people who moved over here.
[02:20:05.605 --> 02:20:07.847]  And I know what turned the city blue.
[02:20:08.087 --> 02:20:09.988]  And I see the, you talk about good and evil.
[02:20:10.028 --> 02:20:10.889]  I see the devil.
[02:20:10.929 --> 02:20:12.830]  I see evil around me all the time.
[02:20:12.951 --> 02:20:20.136]  And I want to talk directly to the people that like, from the blue city, like me, who grew up in the hood, who now got out of the hood.
[02:20:20.655 --> 02:20:22.876]  And now realizing what the world is really about.
[02:20:23.356 --> 02:20:25.316]  We need to wake up our family members.
[02:20:25.336 --> 02:20:26.777]  We need to wake up everybody else.
[02:20:26.797 --> 02:20:31.958]  And the way you do it is by going directly at their G. I saw your clip with T.I.
[02:20:31.978 --> 02:20:36.179]  I haven't heard the whole thing yet, but the clip that they chose to put online looks like T.I.
[02:20:36.599 --> 02:20:39.860]  owns you, so-and-so, even though it's ridiculous with his argument.
[02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:41.561]  I want to talk directly to him, too.
[02:20:41.921 --> 02:20:43.681]  Hey, T.I., where's your G?
[02:20:44.321 --> 02:20:49.943]  Do you see that you're getting work, the Democrats are working you, that you're going against the people who are against
[02:20:50.427 --> 02:20:55.968]  You're with the people who are against the guy who's trying to point out that you've been getting worked your whole life.
[02:20:56.508 --> 02:21:02.849]  Like, when you see people on the street, and they're ignorant, and they don't understand God, talk directly to their pride.
[02:21:03.170 --> 02:21:05.130]  Be like, you're getting worked.
[02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:06.190]  You're getting rolled.
[02:21:06.570 --> 02:21:11.671]  You know, I said all that to him, and I tried to be friendly, but of course they edited it to make it look like he won the debates.
[02:21:12.051 --> 02:21:12.771]  It's all about that.
[02:21:12.811 --> 02:21:13.872]  But in the end, they'll come to the show.
[02:21:13.892 --> 02:21:14.552]  They'll find the truth.
[02:21:14.592 --> 02:21:15.132]  God bless you, sir.
[02:21:16.590 --> 02:21:26.516]  All right, Gerald Cilente is taking over right now, and I was already going to go a little bit into this segment to ask him a question, because he's a smart guy, best-selling author, researcher, one of the top trends researchers out there.
[02:21:27.357 --> 02:21:36.463]  I wanted to ask him, as he joins us from Kingston, New York, birthplace of the colonial revolution, what he would call this period, because Russell Limbaugh is saying we've been in a soft civil war.
[02:21:36.483 --> 02:21:37.343]  I've been saying that for years.
[02:21:37.763 --> 02:21:39.224]  Trump says they're trying to start a civil war.
[02:21:40.385 --> 02:21:42.907]  Regardless, what he did with Ukraine, there's nothing there.
[02:21:43.047 --> 02:21:44.688]  We've got Schiff putting out fake
[02:21:45.580 --> 02:21:47.942]  Transcripts, but they're moving forward with it.
[02:21:47.962 --> 02:21:59.029]  They're moving forward with the articles by Thanksgiving and they want him out by the year because he's going after the deep state in my view and pointing out that China has sold this country out.
[02:21:59.910 --> 02:22:06.174]  And now we have the former governor of Massachusetts saying we need to kill him for treason.
[02:22:07.215 --> 02:22:13.359]  You've got just Saturday night, Saturday Night Live making jokes about killing him.
[02:22:14.796 --> 02:22:18.218]  And just gut level and also looking at, they're making their move right now.
[02:22:18.258 --> 02:22:22.060]  And I wanted to ask Joel Celente if he thinks that's right, A and B, why are they doing it?
[02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:26.142]  But here's the clip from Saturday Night Live.
[02:22:26.162 --> 02:22:27.603]  See the full clip on InfoWars.com.
[02:22:27.623 --> 02:22:28.564]  Here it is.
[02:22:28.624 --> 02:22:33.586]  Well, because when they said Trump is getting impeached, I immediately thought, great, Trump's fired.
[02:22:33.606 --> 02:22:34.327]  Let's get drunk.
[02:22:35.507 --> 02:22:37.729]  But they're like, no, he's just being impeached.
[02:22:38.149 --> 02:22:39.850]  But he ain't exactly peached yet.
[02:22:40.610 --> 02:22:42.211]  It's still going to take another year or so.
[02:22:42.231 --> 02:22:43.372]  And I'm like, well, damn, that sucks.
[02:22:43.412 --> 02:22:43.952]  Let's get drunk.
[02:22:45.413 --> 02:22:50.275]  I mean, President's only a four-year job, but it feels like it's taken him five years to just fire his ass.
[02:22:50.915 --> 02:22:51.775]  It's frustrating.
[02:22:51.915 --> 02:22:57.918]  You know, I bet somebody explained how long impeachment takes to John Wilkes Booth, and he was like, okay, well, where's he at right now?
[02:23:02.959 --> 02:23:05.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, the corporate media is out of bullets.
[02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:07.361]  Nobody listens to them, nobody believes them.
[02:23:08.281 --> 02:23:12.683]  Antifa's beating up old ladies in the, you know, in the street, and the left's praising it for no reason.
[02:23:13.703 --> 02:23:22.986]  It's a collective madness, and this existential crisis is only expanding, and Schiff's not gotten in trouble for putting out fake transcripts.
[02:23:24.727 --> 02:23:26.147]  Where does this end, Gerald Celente?
[02:23:26.607 --> 02:23:27.868]  What would you call this period we're in?
[02:23:29.228 --> 02:23:34.310]  I'd call it the decline of the Empire of America.
[02:23:34.490 --> 02:23:36.171]  I mean, we're going down so quick.
[02:23:36.231 --> 02:23:42.673]  I mean, you put that clown on, that so-called comic, there wasn't a funny line that he said
[02:23:43.336 --> 02:23:45.937]  There was no real laughter coming out of the audience.
[02:23:46.857 --> 02:23:51.798]  And secondly, what do I care what what clowns and comics have to say?
[02:23:52.619 --> 02:23:56.060]  And you really nailed it when you said about the mainstream media.
[02:23:56.980 --> 02:24:00.461]  We're doing our, you know, the Trends Journal now is a weekly.
[02:24:01.161 --> 02:24:05.262]  And the top story, of course, is what's going on with this impeachment.
[02:24:06.142 --> 02:24:08.523]  And we end the first part of it by saying,
[02:24:10.572 --> 02:24:31.717]  CNN, Fox, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, CBS, NPR, Washington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and the rest of America's junk news media spewing the party line propaganda for the junk food addicted culture to swallow.
[02:24:32.758 --> 02:24:37.639]  That's how stupid you have to be to listen to one word that they're saying.
[02:24:38.297 --> 02:24:48.639]  If you're hooked on junk food and you can't control your eating habits, your mind is gone when you listen to the stupid crap that they're shoveling down your throat with this.
[02:24:49.559 --> 02:24:57.861]  When they're calling what's going on with the impeachment, they're calling it a constitutional crisis.
[02:24:58.881 --> 02:25:03.642]  Oh yeah, it wasn't a constitutional crisis that
[02:25:04.404 --> 02:25:11.870]  George, may he rot in hell before he dies, Bush, led us to war based on lies.
[02:25:12.665 --> 02:25:16.586]  That Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda.
[02:25:16.987 --> 02:25:19.007]  That's not a constitutional crisis.
[02:25:19.507 --> 02:25:37.434]  It's not a constitutional crisis that we got the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, Homeland Security, every one of these low-life, quote, intelligence people, with not an ounce of brains, spying on us constantly, listening to every word we say.
[02:25:38.459 --> 02:25:40.239]  Watching everything that we do.
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:41.900]  Facial recognition.
[02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:44.220]  That's not a constitutional crisis.
[02:25:44.701 --> 02:25:55.583]  Alex Jones, it is not a constitutional crisis that you do not have freedom of speech or anybody else that they don't want to listen to.
[02:25:56.043 --> 02:25:58.124]  That's not a constitutional crisis.
[02:25:58.684 --> 02:26:04.745]  Ladies and gentlemen, and children of all ages, tune into the mainstream media.
[02:26:05.105 --> 02:26:07.026]  The constitutional crisis is
[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:30.493]  Did Joe Biden's son, Hunter, get $50,000 a month out on a board of directors for Burisma Energy when the little boy knows nothing about energy, probably never been to the Ukraine, yet think daddy got him the job?
[02:26:30.874 --> 02:26:37.618]  Oh, he'd just been thrown out of the Navy for cocaine use and was dishonorably discharged, so he was good at snorting cocaine.
[02:26:38.575 --> 02:26:51.365]  But again, looking at the issue, this is a constitutional crisis because Trump wants to find out why they got rid of that guy that was the prosecutor that was looking into this.
[02:26:51.806 --> 02:26:57.030]  And we got people like Dingell over there shooting up Dingell Berry.
[02:26:57.090 --> 02:26:57.931]  How about that?
[02:26:58.451 --> 02:27:03.857]  Another woman, another person, born on third base, thought they hit a home run.
[02:27:04.157 --> 02:27:17.511]  Her old man was congressman, never worked a day in his life, sucking off the public tit like Biden has all his life, and they're telling me that this is a constitutional crisis?
[02:27:17.831 --> 02:27:19.433]  What am I, six years old?
[02:27:20.053 --> 02:27:23.675]  Yes you are if you listen to the mainstream media.
[02:27:23.936 --> 02:27:27.318]  Because this is the crap that they're shoving down our throat.
[02:27:27.618 --> 02:27:28.698]  The prostitutes.
[02:27:29.279 --> 02:27:34.542]  The media whores that get paid to put out by their Washington whore masters.
[02:27:34.602 --> 02:27:35.643]  And have you heard the latest?
[02:27:35.823 --> 02:27:41.706]  Biden is demanding, they sent a letter to all the networks saying Giuliani's a liar, you're not allowed to interview him.
[02:27:41.746 --> 02:27:43.467]  But Giuliani's a freak too.
[02:27:43.868 --> 02:27:47.110]  Oh I know, but I mean imagine them saying who can go on air and who can't.
[02:27:47.130 --> 02:27:49.051]  I mean that's the level the Democrats... Of course I can.
[02:27:49.671 --> 02:27:49.831]  Yeah.
[02:27:49.891 --> 02:27:53.713]  No, of course I can, because they don't have me on the air anymore.
[02:27:54.013 --> 02:27:58.155]  Because they don't like what I have to say when I disagree with them economically, politically.
[02:27:58.795 --> 02:27:59.695]  Of course this is who they are!
[02:27:59.715 --> 02:28:02.056]  So let me ask you this when you're taking over, but I really want to get your take on it.
[02:28:02.756 --> 02:28:04.217]  I smell they're really going after him.
[02:28:04.257 --> 02:28:07.378]  They say they are, because they know that there are corruptions coming out.
[02:28:07.819 --> 02:28:10.079]  And I agree, they're crazy, it's not going to go well.
[02:28:10.340 --> 02:28:12.620]  But I just smell big explosions.
[02:28:13.441 --> 02:28:14.201]  Yo, you're right.
[02:28:14.441 --> 02:28:14.821]  It is.
[02:28:14.901 --> 02:28:18.483]  Look, this might bring down Trump because they're going to find other things.
[02:28:19.198 --> 02:28:21.359]  It'll probably bring down Biden too.
[02:28:22.079 --> 02:28:26.741]  You're probably setting it up for one of the other freaks to win.
[02:28:27.221 --> 02:28:28.821]  Maybe, what's her name there?
[02:28:29.802 --> 02:28:30.762]  Elizabeth Warren.
[02:28:30.782 --> 02:28:31.142]  Pocahontas.
[02:28:32.162 --> 02:28:33.223]  Yeah, Pocahontas.
[02:28:33.743 --> 02:28:34.503]  And I love these people.
[02:28:34.743 --> 02:28:35.884]  Oh, I'm so sorry.
[02:28:35.984 --> 02:28:39.305]  I hate these people who say I'm sorry after they get caught.
[02:28:39.745 --> 02:28:41.626]  Anyway, here's the deal with Trump.
[02:28:41.666 --> 02:28:42.606]  It's very simple.
[02:28:43.666 --> 02:28:45.807]  He's never been a member he wanted to be.
[02:28:46.207 --> 02:28:48.768]  He can never be a member of the White Shoe Boy Club.
[02:28:49.341 --> 02:28:53.063]  Remember, he brought Mar-a-Lago over there because they wouldn't let him into the other club.
[02:28:53.463 --> 02:28:55.684]  He wasn't a Harvard, Princeton, Yale guy.
[02:28:55.704 --> 02:28:58.386]  He didn't go to the party.
[02:28:58.446 --> 02:29:01.147]  He's not a member of the gang.
[02:29:01.167 --> 02:29:03.549]  And he's taking over the gang.
[02:29:03.569 --> 02:29:04.609]  You got it?
[02:29:04.869 --> 02:29:06.670]  So the gang wants to get rid of him.
[02:29:07.551 --> 02:29:09.412]  That's how I look at it.
[02:29:09.732 --> 02:29:11.193]  No, you're right.
[02:29:11.233 --> 02:29:11.673]  Say what you want.
[02:29:11.713 --> 02:29:15.655]  He's a maverick who came in and isn't running things the way they used to run it.
[02:29:15.735 --> 02:29:16.956]  And they believe they own this country.
[02:29:17.998 --> 02:29:18.519]  You got it.
[02:29:19.060 --> 02:29:21.545]  And look, here's my question.
[02:29:22.026 --> 02:29:25.112]  Who's going to be the next Jeffrey Epstein?
[02:29:25.614 --> 02:29:28.079]  Because you're going to see that one happen from this, too.
[02:29:30.086 --> 02:29:34.347]  Ed Buck, you know, and by the way, I agree with you, and you're going to take over right now.
[02:29:34.407 --> 02:29:35.687]  Thank you, Gerald Cilente, for being here with us.
[02:29:35.727 --> 02:29:40.829]  But you notice it came out in the news that, sure enough, guess who has been staying at Epstein's house and covering it up?
[02:29:40.949 --> 02:29:41.709]  Bill Gates.
[02:29:42.309 --> 02:29:46.350]  I mean, these guys are a bunch of sick freaks, and their whole house of cards is coming down.
[02:29:46.370 --> 02:29:48.331]  We'll be right back with Gerald Cilente, Trends Research.
[02:29:48.351 --> 02:29:48.711]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.851 --> 02:29:51.951]  Hey, hey, hey!
[02:29:52.091 --> 02:29:55.032]  Great to be here on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:29:55.892 --> 02:29:58.373]  Yep, what a time we're going through over here.
[02:29:59.728 --> 02:30:12.233]  On the impeachment, first before I get to that, you know, Alex was talking a lot about, with the person on earlier, about Jesus Christ, and as I say, I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[02:30:14.134 --> 02:30:17.495]  I won't die for war, but I'll fight for peace.
[02:30:18.475 --> 02:30:20.956]  And that's why I launched Occupy Peace.
[02:30:22.677 --> 02:30:28.059]  Close those bases overseas, bring home the troops, secure the homeland,
[02:30:28.908 --> 02:30:33.430]  Put them to work rebuilding our third world rotted infrastructure.
[02:30:34.531 --> 02:30:38.273]  WPA program, Work Progress Administration of 1930s.
[02:30:39.153 --> 02:30:41.294]  Bring it into the 21st century.
[02:30:41.394 --> 02:30:53.660]  Troops Progress Administration will give these troops skills that we need to build this country that they don't have and we can't find.
[02:30:53.680 --> 02:30:56.842]  A lot of the contractors out there, you can't find skilled labor.
[02:30:57.697 --> 02:31:01.898]  We'll give them skills to rebuild this rotted infrastructure.
[02:31:02.158 --> 02:31:03.799]  You saw the study that just came out.
[02:31:04.779 --> 02:31:18.463]  The Pentagon's worried about the high suicide rate that's going on of enlisted people, not to mention the 22 a day of veterans that are committing suicide.
[02:31:20.004 --> 02:31:27.186]  And many of them are probably committing suicide because of the conditions that they're being subjected to.
[02:31:29.599 --> 02:31:30.439]  They're immoral.
[02:31:31.519 --> 02:31:34.460]  Fighting wars in foreign countries that have done nothing to us.
[02:31:35.240 --> 02:31:36.701]  Against the Constitution.
[02:31:38.441 --> 02:31:43.762]  And when you take that pledge of allegiance, that's what you're fighting for.
[02:31:44.122 --> 02:31:45.183]  The Constitution.
[02:31:45.963 --> 02:31:48.643]  And they have us fighting in nations we have no right being in.
[02:31:49.424 --> 02:31:50.264]  Like Syria.
[02:31:50.964 --> 02:31:51.344]  Yemen.
[02:31:52.244 --> 02:31:52.684]  Iraq.
[02:31:53.365 --> 02:31:54.125]  Afghanistan.
[02:31:54.765 --> 02:31:55.205]  Libya.
[02:31:55.905 --> 02:31:56.545]  Somalia.
[02:31:57.105 --> 02:31:57.666]  Sudan.
[02:31:58.506 --> 02:31:59.186]  And on and on.
[02:32:01.019 --> 02:32:06.422]  So, when we talk about Jesus Christ, let's remember, it's the Prince of Peace.
[02:32:07.282 --> 02:32:09.223]  And I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[02:32:09.303 --> 02:32:10.303]  I'll fight for peace.
[02:32:11.244 --> 02:32:12.785]  But again, I won't die for war.
[02:32:14.125 --> 02:32:20.668]  And ironically, it was in this Trends Journal, going back to the fall of 2014, I wrote about it right here.
[02:32:31.072 --> 02:32:31.372]  Yep.
[02:32:32.432 --> 02:32:33.012]  Here we go.
[02:32:35.153 --> 02:32:52.076]  How many recall that not long after the speech, this is a Victoria Nuland, our Assistant Secretary of State, her husband Kagan, the head of that right-wing group, Secretary of State under Hillary Clinton.
[02:32:52.776 --> 02:32:55.056]  She was the Assistant Secretary under Hillary Clinton.
[02:32:56.036 --> 02:33:00.597]  She gave a speech at the National Press Club.
[02:33:01.886 --> 02:33:02.787]  About Ukraine.
[02:33:03.828 --> 02:33:08.251]  On one side Chevron, the other side Exxon Mobil.
[02:33:08.271 --> 02:33:14.716]  A number of months later, this is what happened.
[02:33:17.438 --> 02:33:29.408]  How many recall that not long after her speech, Vice President Joseph Biden's boy, Hunter Biden, was appointed to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings Limited,
[02:33:30.626 --> 02:33:32.928]  That's Ukraine's largest energy company.
[02:33:34.408 --> 02:33:49.618]  Also saddling up on the Burisma board was Devon Archer, a business partner of Christopher Hines, the Hines of 57 Varieties, who is, coincidentally, the stepson of U.S.
[02:33:49.658 --> 02:33:53.861]  Secretary of State John Kerry.
[02:33:55.282 --> 02:33:56.703]  We have to ask ourselves,
[02:33:58.325 --> 02:34:01.688]  How low have our moral standards sunk?
[02:34:02.949 --> 02:34:25.287]  When did it become routine, expected, and business as usual that we are led down such destructive roads with so little accountability and no regard for the history that's so obviously and indisputably repeating itself?
[02:34:26.496 --> 02:34:30.017]  The history repeating itself, of course, is corruption and war.
[02:34:30.037 --> 02:34:33.878]  The United States launched a coup attempt.
[02:34:34.778 --> 02:34:45.380]  A coup wasn't an attempt against the ruling leader that was democratically elected in Ukraine, Yanukovych.
[02:34:48.401 --> 02:34:49.982]  But those are only details.
[02:34:50.802 --> 02:34:56.183]  So now we're having wasting our time, wasting our money.
[02:34:58.041 --> 02:35:23.247]  Wasting our energy in an impeachment process that's coming about because Trump wanted to find out what the dirty deal was that Biden's son got to be on the board of directors of Ukraine's
[02:35:23.922 --> 02:35:31.768]  Largest energy company when the cat never been there before and knows nothing about energy.
[02:35:33.269 --> 02:35:35.671]  That, you cannot make this up.
[02:35:36.291 --> 02:35:39.413]  That's how desperate the Dumbo Craps are.
[02:35:40.274 --> 02:35:45.758]  And again, to me, this is a fight between the Dumbo Craps and the Repulsive Kings.
[02:35:45.778 --> 02:35:47.459]  I have nothing to do with either of them.
[02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:49.741]  But I am an American.
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:54.041]  And I don't want my energy and resources wasted on that.
[02:35:54.921 --> 02:35:57.922]  And by the way, the other two elements of Occupy Peace.
[02:35:59.082 --> 02:36:03.163]  Force Congress to vote to go to war, which they have not done since World War II.
[02:36:03.643 --> 02:36:09.625]  Who made up this stuff that we're giving El Presidente the power to do what they want?
[02:36:11.165 --> 02:36:15.546]  And finally, to put a referendum on each state ballot where we'll tell Congress how to vote.
[02:36:16.106 --> 02:36:18.827]  Because we're the ones that pay for it with our money and our lives.
[02:36:20.069 --> 02:36:25.313]  So, as I mentioned to Alex earlier, this is not a constitutional crisis.
[02:36:25.333 --> 02:36:35.460]  This has nothing to do with national security, as the Democrats are repeating and the media propagandizes for them.
[02:36:36.961 --> 02:36:41.525]  All this has to do with the presidential reality show and who's going to win it in 2020.
[02:36:41.725 --> 02:36:45.748]  And they're going to do everything they can to get Trump out.
[02:36:49.952 --> 02:36:57.637]  And as I said, Trump is not a member of the white shoe boy gang, even though he wanted to join.
[02:36:58.037 --> 02:37:00.719]  He's an outsider and they don't want him there.
[02:37:01.939 --> 02:37:02.980]  They don't want him there.
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.301]  He's not a member of the club.
[02:37:05.401 --> 02:37:12.426]  You know, when I was down in DC and I used to go to all these groups, I was a chief government affairs specialist and I used to go to these meetings.
[02:37:13.386 --> 02:37:14.247]  I never fit in.
[02:37:15.327 --> 02:37:16.848]  I was never a member of the club.
[02:37:17.649 --> 02:37:18.609]  They didn't want me in.
[02:37:18.669 --> 02:37:19.550]  I'm an outsider.
[02:37:22.296 --> 02:37:25.819]  And look at the club of freaks that are running and ruining our lives.
[02:37:26.879 --> 02:37:29.001]  Maybe you look up to Nancy Pelosi.
[02:37:29.681 --> 02:37:30.162]  I got it.
[02:37:30.202 --> 02:37:31.262]  Little Chuckie Schumer.
[02:37:31.302 --> 02:37:32.163]  He's your boy.
[02:37:33.024 --> 02:37:34.745]  Diane Notso Feinstein.
[02:37:35.365 --> 02:37:37.066]  Maybe little Lindsey Graham.
[02:37:37.827 --> 02:37:39.408]  How about Mitch McConnell?
[02:37:41.009 --> 02:37:45.292]  Look at the freaks running and ruining our lives.
[02:37:46.493 --> 02:37:48.254]  How could people tolerate this?
[02:37:50.496 --> 02:37:50.676]  But
[02:37:51.420 --> 02:37:52.200]  Most will.
[02:37:53.361 --> 02:37:55.541]  They'll tune into the mainstream media.
[02:37:57.342 --> 02:37:59.083]  You think they're stupid already?
[02:38:00.663 --> 02:38:08.286]  Stay tuned to the mainstream media, listen to what's going on, and get dumbed down with their junk news.
[02:38:09.066 --> 02:38:09.907]  That's all it is.
[02:38:10.807 --> 02:38:14.348]  If you eat junk food, you'll love junk news.
[02:38:14.968 --> 02:38:16.449]  They go hand in hand.
[02:38:17.789 --> 02:38:19.450]  And that's why you need to support
[02:38:20.217 --> 02:38:21.077]  InfoWars.
[02:38:22.017 --> 02:38:23.958]  Do what you can to buy their products.
[02:38:25.078 --> 02:38:26.358]  Keep the truth alive.
[02:38:26.398 --> 02:38:29.359]  And of course, consider subscribing to the Trends Journal.
[02:38:29.419 --> 02:38:30.319]  It's a weekly now.
[02:38:30.899 --> 02:38:32.780]  From a quarterly to a monthly to a weekly.
[02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:36.961]  Because demand is so high for the truth.
[02:38:39.261 --> 02:38:41.902]  So, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:38:42.562 --> 02:38:43.822]  They have these sales on.
[02:38:44.542 --> 02:38:45.402]  Great products.
[02:38:45.462 --> 02:38:47.903]  And by the way, we're going into the Greatest Depression.
[02:38:48.726 --> 02:38:51.108]  Now it's the time for independence.
[02:38:51.988 --> 02:38:55.230]  And when I say that, you better be independently prepared.
[02:38:55.971 --> 02:38:57.892]  The future is going to be in your hands alone.
[02:38:58.693 --> 02:39:05.637]  And they have a number of products out there that will help you get through the rough times when the system goes down.
[02:39:05.657 --> 02:39:08.219]  We're going to be back in a few.
[02:39:08.820 --> 02:39:09.340]  Stay tuned.
[02:39:12.423 --> 02:39:12.943]  Hello.
[02:39:12.983 --> 02:39:13.404]  Hello.
[02:39:13.444 --> 02:39:13.884]  Hello.
[02:39:13.904 --> 02:39:15.745]  Hope you like the show.
[02:39:16.426 --> 02:39:20.449]  And if you do, remember to support InfoWars.
[02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:24.331]  They're running out of stock on some top selling products.
[02:39:24.932 --> 02:39:32.997]  50% off all InfoWars life products and up to 50% off preparedness products.
[02:39:33.598 --> 02:39:34.779]  And that's what I was
[02:39:40.157 --> 02:39:42.899]  The greatest depression is coming.
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:46.382]  Everyone's talking about recession, recession.
[02:39:46.422 --> 02:39:48.404]  Yeah, it doesn't happen all at once.
[02:39:48.984 --> 02:39:50.505]  It slows down and goes down.
[02:39:51.046 --> 02:39:52.627]  And the slowdown is going down.
[02:39:53.187 --> 02:39:54.648]  So you want to be prepared.
[02:39:55.189 --> 02:39:56.170]  Prepare now.
[02:39:57.290 --> 02:40:00.873]  As I say, prepare for the worst under these conditions.
[02:40:01.494 --> 02:40:04.116]  If the worst doesn't happen and you're prepared for it, what did you lose?
[02:40:04.136 --> 02:40:04.916]  You lost nothing.
[02:40:05.957 --> 02:40:09.380]  If the worst happens and you're not prepared, you can lose everything.
[02:40:10.703 --> 02:40:11.744]  So stay prepared.
[02:40:13.245 --> 02:40:14.426]  The worst is yet to come.
[02:40:14.446 --> 02:40:20.471]  As a matter of fact, here's the headline in the Financial Times today.
[02:40:22.612 --> 02:40:34.061]  Draghi backs calls for fiscal union to bolster Eurozone against rivals.
[02:40:34.181 --> 02:40:36.343]  Need for higher spending urgent.
[02:40:38.024 --> 02:40:39.245]  Need for higher spending?
[02:40:41.004 --> 02:40:42.005]  You're deep in debt already?
[02:40:42.025 --> 02:40:43.646]  Want to go deeper in debt?
[02:40:43.686 --> 02:40:45.627]  Of course, Germany isn't, but the others are.
[02:40:46.687 --> 02:40:52.871]  Spend more money, because our monetary methadone that we're shooting into the system, not going to work that well this time.
[02:40:53.551 --> 02:40:58.574]  We're already in negative rates over here in Europe, and we're only down 0.5%.
[02:40:58.634 --> 02:41:00.355]  Put your money in that Swiss bank.
[02:41:00.815 --> 02:41:05.938]  Yep, we'll give you a negative 0.75% for putting your dough in there.
[02:41:06.558 --> 02:41:09.200]  Denmark, one country after another, negative rates.
[02:41:11.735 --> 02:41:12.916]  Japan, negative rates.
[02:41:14.056 --> 02:41:15.197]  This thing's going down.
[02:41:15.277 --> 02:41:16.137]  Be prepared.
[02:41:17.038 --> 02:41:24.961]  And again, 50% off all InfoWars Life products and up to 50% off Preparedness products.
[02:41:25.061 --> 02:41:30.064]  Plus, free shipping and double Patriot points.
[02:41:31.405 --> 02:41:33.406]  So, staying on the economy.
[02:41:33.606 --> 02:41:34.846]  Outer markets are up a little bit.
[02:41:34.906 --> 02:41:36.167]  Gold took a big hit today.
[02:41:36.267 --> 02:41:36.527]  Boof!
[02:41:37.267 --> 02:41:39.909]  Down to the 1470s mark from the high of 15.
[02:41:41.718 --> 02:41:44.720]  32 little while ago a couple of weeks week or so.
[02:41:46.881 --> 02:41:47.961]  You know my forecasts.
[02:41:49.322 --> 02:41:55.545]  I said the low for gold and now that it broke by the way between below 1480 that's significant.
[02:41:56.366 --> 02:41:58.227]  That was one of our resistance points.
[02:41:59.187 --> 02:42:00.808]  You can see it going down to 1450 goes below 1450.
[02:42:00.868 --> 02:42:04.970]  We see 1390 around there is being the bottom to bring down of gold.
[02:42:11.727 --> 02:42:16.649]  From there, we see it going back up to the $2,000 and above mark.
[02:42:17.449 --> 02:42:18.309]  I'm saying above $2,000.
[02:42:18.609 --> 02:42:24.432]  There are a lot of people saying in the business $10,000 an ounce, $25,000 an ounce.
[02:42:26.052 --> 02:42:31.354]  But I'm sticking with where I'm looking at now, within the next year or so, over $2,000.
[02:42:31.414 --> 02:42:37.096]  This is very important about the fiscal stimulus going on.
[02:42:39.189 --> 02:42:40.590]  There's a global slowdown.
[02:42:40.890 --> 02:42:42.291]  Has nothing to do with trade.
[02:42:43.392 --> 02:42:47.915]  You think India's car sales were down last month 41% because of a trade war?
[02:42:48.435 --> 02:42:49.716]  They're not in a trade war.
[02:42:50.196 --> 02:42:51.357]  The people got no dough.
[02:42:52.158 --> 02:42:54.459]  Hey, look what's going over there in Indonesia.
[02:42:55.199 --> 02:42:56.360]  Riots on the streets.
[02:42:57.301 --> 02:42:57.561]  Yeah.
[02:42:58.422 --> 02:42:59.823]  Take a trip around the world.
[02:43:01.584 --> 02:43:02.644]  One after another.
[02:43:04.726 --> 02:43:06.527]  Look what's going on every day.
[02:43:08.237 --> 02:43:09.678]  You see more and more people.
[02:43:09.778 --> 02:43:11.499]  It's going on now again in Egypt.
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:13.821]  Yep, Arab Spring 2.0.
[02:43:15.783 --> 02:43:17.284]  What are they rising up against?
[02:43:17.964 --> 02:43:22.508]  Eh, about a third of the population is living in poverty or more than that.
[02:43:24.269 --> 02:43:27.211]  They're living under the dictatorship rule of El-Sisi.
[02:43:29.573 --> 02:43:31.354]  Look what's going on in Argentina.
[02:43:33.896 --> 02:43:34.897]  Third unemployment.
[02:43:36.069 --> 02:43:38.750]  Peso not worth anything compared to what it used to be?
[02:43:40.591 --> 02:43:46.393]  You're about $57 billion in debt by the International Monetary Fund?
[02:43:48.814 --> 02:43:50.434]  Look what's going on in the UK.
[02:43:50.494 --> 02:43:52.175]  See the numbers that just came out today?
[02:43:52.195 --> 02:43:54.096]  Economy down.
[02:43:55.336 --> 02:43:55.616]  Minus 0.2%.
[02:43:56.057 --> 02:43:59.978]  It's a global slowdown.
[02:44:00.598 --> 02:44:02.519]  It's going to go into the Greatest Depression.
[02:44:04.180 --> 02:44:04.940]  Very important.
[02:44:05.948 --> 02:44:15.492]  If this impeachment process continues to escalate, which it will, against Trump, go back to what happened when Bill Clinton was impeached.
[02:44:16.753 --> 02:44:21.474]  You saw the equity markets go down almost 20%.
[02:44:21.715 --> 02:44:24.556]  And then you know what happened?
[02:44:26.016 --> 02:44:28.477]  It reversed quickly during the impeachment process.
[02:44:29.998 --> 02:44:31.078]  It's different this time.
[02:44:31.779 --> 02:44:32.079]  This isn't 1998.
[02:44:32.139 --> 02:44:32.219]  It's 2020.
[02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:39.583]  19.
[02:44:37.422 --> 02:44:39.583]  The markets have been artificially propped up.
[02:44:40.324 --> 02:44:44.748]  They weren't artificially propped up when Bill Clinton was being impeached.
[02:44:46.029 --> 02:44:48.951]  We have a P.E.
[02:44:49.011 --> 02:44:54.355]  ratio, the solid one's around 16, 16 times price earnings.
[02:44:55.897 --> 02:44:58.158]  We're now 10 points above that, above 26.
[02:45:01.721 --> 02:45:03.603]  So now when the markets go down,
[02:45:04.687 --> 02:45:12.553]  Because of this moronic impeachment process, which is a waste of time, a waste of energy, and is dividing the country even more.
[02:45:12.573 --> 02:45:17.757]  When these markets go down, they're going to crash out.
[02:45:19.738 --> 02:45:20.239]  That's right.
[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:22.981]  Globally.
[02:45:25.322 --> 02:45:26.603]  They're playing with fire.
[02:45:26.623 --> 02:45:34.169]  They're too stupid, too arrogant, too self-serving to understand that.
[02:45:35.029 --> 02:45:36.970]  They're only interested in themselves.
[02:45:38.291 --> 02:45:49.097]  All what's going on now with this impeachment is a setup, nothing more than the 2020 race to the White House, the presidential reality show.
[02:45:51.958 --> 02:45:53.259]  They know Trump can't win.
[02:45:53.919 --> 02:45:55.860]  I mean, excuse me, they know Biden can't win.
[02:45:56.561 --> 02:45:59.082]  As I've been saying, if the election were held now, Trump would win.
[02:46:01.123 --> 02:46:04.285]  They know that Biden's going to keep stepping on his tongue.
[02:46:05.572 --> 02:46:06.733]  Forgetting what he said?
[02:46:09.615 --> 02:46:11.037]  People aren't nuts about him.
[02:46:12.978 --> 02:46:15.721]  Again, I think it's a setup for one of the other candidates.
[02:46:17.582 --> 02:46:20.104]  But the bigger picture is not them.
[02:46:21.245 --> 02:46:33.756]  And the more people that stay tuned to this and waste their time getting involved in it, the less they know what's going on in the world that's going to affect their jobs, their businesses,
[02:46:34.841 --> 02:46:35.721]  Your families.
[02:46:37.542 --> 02:46:38.363]  Your lives.
[02:46:39.904 --> 02:46:40.924]  It won't be the news.
[02:46:42.865 --> 02:46:44.806]  You'll be consumed with this other stuff.
[02:46:46.647 --> 02:46:50.729]  So what we're recommending is that you stay on top of the news and ahead of the trends.
[02:46:53.650 --> 02:46:59.753]  And by watching the mainstream media news, you just get dumbed down lower.
[02:47:00.654 --> 02:47:02.815]  And it's going to go much lower than it is now.
[02:47:04.639 --> 02:47:15.324]  So on to some other things to look at is also what's going on with the war talk against Iran.
[02:47:16.204 --> 02:47:32.812]  We saw the clown prince of Saudi Arabia on 60 Minutes this weekend blaming Iran for the drone strikes against the Saudi oil fields and refinery.
[02:47:33.803 --> 02:47:35.384]  The Houthis are claiming they did it.
[02:47:38.225 --> 02:47:47.629]  And the American media is saying and repeating what the Washington Hallmasters are telling him to say, that the Houthis don't have the technology.
[02:47:49.009 --> 02:47:49.549]  Guess what?
[02:47:50.290 --> 02:47:51.030]  Yes, they do.
[02:47:52.010 --> 02:47:59.113]  A new study just came out by Bard College about all the countries that have drones.
[02:47:59.133 --> 02:48:01.194]  You know how many drones they got out there?
[02:48:02.423 --> 02:48:02.683]  About 30,000.
[02:48:03.243 --> 02:48:04.224]  Yeah.
[02:48:07.084 --> 02:48:09.025]  This is new millennium warfare.
[02:48:09.285 --> 02:48:09.845]  Part of it.
[02:48:10.865 --> 02:48:12.206]  Hypersonic weapons.
[02:48:12.866 --> 02:48:13.466]  Imagine.
[02:48:14.206 --> 02:48:14.847]  Imagine.
[02:48:17.567 --> 02:48:18.828]  You're in New York.
[02:48:20.968 --> 02:48:23.709]  All of a sudden, drones come flying in.
[02:48:27.130 --> 02:48:29.331]  Thousands of them.
[02:48:29.371 --> 02:48:30.471]  With chemical weapons.
[02:48:31.328 --> 02:48:32.209]  With bombs?
[02:48:33.129 --> 02:48:33.970]  With who knows what?
[02:48:35.551 --> 02:48:39.394]  You think any defense is going to stop them?
[02:48:40.395 --> 02:48:42.697]  That's what the Third World War will look like.
[02:48:43.317 --> 02:48:44.899]  And that's why we need peace.
[02:48:44.979 --> 02:48:46.059]  It'll be worse than that.
[02:48:46.820 --> 02:48:49.782]  If we go to war with Iran, it'll be the beginning of World War III.
[02:48:51.964 --> 02:48:59.610]  And as Einstein said, I don't know how World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.
[02:49:01.411 --> 02:49:07.032]  Please help us Occupy Peace, because with peace comes beauty, joy, love, and liberty.
[02:49:07.592 --> 02:49:12.254]  You can't create that in a time of fear and terror.
[02:49:13.294 --> 02:49:27.697]  So do what you can to support InfoWars, Occupy Peace, and remember the Trends Journal Weekly, from a quarterly to a monthly to a weekly, the only place you read history before it happens.
[02:49:28.317 --> 02:49:30.478]  Thanks for tuning in, and thanks for having me.
[02:49:46.875 --> 02:49:51.036]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:49:53.917 --> 02:50:05.220]  In the next two minutes, I am asking you very respectfully for your attention, because these two products go together like a horse and carriage, and they can change your life in so many ways.
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:11.802]  And they also fund the Infowar, which certainly changes all our lives for the better, because if we weren't here fighting back,
[02:50:13.254 --> 02:50:15.375]  The globalists probably would have already had things sewn up.
[02:50:15.395 --> 02:50:25.519]  I mean, they legitimately think that InfoWars has been instrumental in spreading rebellion against their globalist operation and the explosion of populism and nationalism because it's true.
[02:50:25.879 --> 02:50:28.160]  Our guests, our listeners, we the people,
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:36.523]  Have absolutely challenged their corrupt narrative on man-made global warming, on their attacks on the family, their attacks on the Second Amendment.
[02:50:37.003 --> 02:50:39.944]  It is an incredibly beautiful time to be alive right now.
[02:50:40.344 --> 02:50:42.285]  And that's because you've been taking action.
[02:50:42.645 --> 02:50:44.446]  But we need funding and you need these products.
[02:50:45.478 --> 02:50:51.404]  Now our ultimate bone broth is the strongest, best formula out there at half the price of leading competitors.
[02:50:52.204 --> 02:50:56.809]  It has great high quality bone broth concentrate from chicken.
[02:50:57.389 --> 02:50:58.771]  It then has the chaga mushroom.
[02:50:58.871 --> 02:51:01.974]  It has bee pollen, turmeric, and so much more.
[02:51:02.394 --> 02:51:03.095]  So strength,
[02:51:03.715 --> 02:51:06.176]  Stamina, your bones, your muscles, your tendons.
[02:51:06.376 --> 02:51:07.996]  It really is the essence.
[02:51:08.316 --> 02:51:15.398]  As all the ancients, every culture knew, they would boil down bones for health and for life and for comfort and just for focus.
[02:51:15.898 --> 02:51:16.498]  It's incredible.
[02:51:17.179 --> 02:51:21.460]  Now, we also have Gut Fusion, which is an amazing product I never promote.
[02:51:21.760 --> 02:51:29.522]  We set out to look at top selling brands of high quality fiber to help flush your guts out, but also other key ingredients that are known for
[02:51:29.802 --> 02:51:31.924]  The gentleman just walked up to me in his picture line.
[02:51:31.944 --> 02:51:32.944]  He says, I have an AR-15.
[02:51:55.919 --> 02:51:59.482]  And I will turn this in if it means saving the lives of our kids.
[02:51:59.822 --> 02:52:01.063]  People want to do the right thing.
[02:52:01.183 --> 02:52:04.766]  Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, non-gun owners alike.
[02:52:05.046 --> 02:52:07.969]  I think we're naive to think that we can just maintain the status quo.
[02:52:08.769 --> 02:52:10.691]  Beto knows what he's doing.
[02:52:12.272 --> 02:52:15.715]  He's sitting there telling you that, oh, a man just walked up to me.
[02:52:15.855 --> 02:52:16.636]  It's a total lie.
[02:52:17.236 --> 02:52:21.840]  And said, oh, I'm going to turn in my AR-15 so people don't get hurt.
[02:52:22.841 --> 02:52:24.242]  That's selling the idea.
[02:52:25.322 --> 02:52:30.366]  That if you own a gun, you're responsible for what criminals do with a gun.
[02:52:31.147 --> 02:52:33.389]  That is such a fraud.
[02:52:33.449 --> 02:52:35.190]  It's so anti-American.
[02:52:35.951 --> 02:52:37.592]  Now, you can always tell him Beto's lying.
[02:52:37.652 --> 02:52:38.593]  His lips are moving.
[02:52:39.935 --> 02:52:41.276]  Or his brain's thinking.
[02:52:41.957 --> 02:52:42.978]  The man's a total fraud.
[02:52:43.638 --> 02:52:49.603]  His father-in-law's worth $28 billion, a big anti-American globalist, gave a billion dollars to Beto's wife.
[02:52:50.184 --> 02:52:55.608]  The guy wrote papers fantasizing about killing children, running them over with cars.
[02:52:56.149 --> 02:52:57.730]  He got arrested for a hit-and-run.
[02:52:58.271 --> 02:52:59.812]  He got arrested for burglary.
[02:53:00.192 --> 02:53:02.234]  The man isn't allowed to own a gun.
[02:53:02.494 --> 02:53:03.975]  He is a deranged criminal.
[02:53:04.895 --> 02:53:07.036]  But of course, deranged criminals want your guns.
[02:53:07.416 --> 02:53:16.361]  They're now turning their guns and are facing five years in jail in New Zealand, even though the man that shot those people wasn't from New Zealand and got the guns illegally.
[02:53:16.581 --> 02:53:22.203]  The globalists want to have a revolution against America, and they want us disarmed before they do it.
[02:53:22.544 --> 02:53:26.786]  1776 could commence again at any time, because they're losing their information war.
[02:53:27.626 --> 02:53:28.947]  Against us, because we're telling the truth.
[02:53:29.627 --> 02:53:34.451]  And so now, Beto is making his move with others, and he has to be rebuked.
[02:53:34.951 --> 02:53:35.912]  He has to be exposed.
[02:53:36.012 --> 02:53:42.556]  And the way to do it is not be intimidated about your Second Amendment, and let them know that you're fully aware of what they're trying to do.
[02:53:43.037 --> 02:53:47.480]  Beto's campaign says, if you want to prove you're not a bad person, turn your guns in.
[02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:49.301]  Hey, Beto, you turn your guns in.
[02:53:49.921 --> 02:53:53.504]  It's a campaign slogan where he says, turn them in to show you're good.
[02:53:53.664 --> 02:53:55.125]  Lay down your arms, you damn
[02:53:55.779 --> 02:53:56.340]  Hands up!
[02:53:56.520 --> 02:53:56.880]  Come out!
[02:53:57.441 --> 02:53:59.604]  And we'll take you away to the gulag.
[02:54:00.304 --> 02:54:02.667]  They're literally trying to disarm us.
[02:54:03.428 --> 02:54:06.412]  They openly say they want to put conservatives in forced labor camps.
[02:54:06.432 --> 02:54:07.533]  They openly say they want to kill us.
[02:54:08.094 --> 02:54:12.219]  They openly say they want to destroy us because we support Trump or America.
[02:54:13.166 --> 02:54:14.646]  We've got to stand up and say no.
[02:54:14.767 --> 02:54:16.847]  And you've got to fund those that are fighting.
[02:54:17.147 --> 02:54:19.468]  Because we're pro-Second Amendment, we're under massive attack.
[02:54:19.948 --> 02:54:21.309]  Hack attack, lawsuits, you name it.
[02:54:21.709 --> 02:54:30.071]  But you can help us stand against this and spread the word on the street against these bullies with a great shirt like Beto Nye, available at Infowarshore.com.
[02:54:30.451 --> 02:54:34.913]  Whether it's supplements or a Betsy Ross flag or a water filter or a book or a film,
[02:54:35.433 --> 02:54:40.957]  These are products that are great, that you need, and shopping with us helps us continue to fight for all of our basic freedoms.
[02:54:41.378 --> 02:54:43.059]  Infowarestore.com.
[02:54:43.319 --> 02:54:44.160]  Thank you for your support.
[02:54:44.420 --> 02:54:44.880]  Hell yes!
[02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:49.904]  We're gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47... And it is very hard to think about this.
[02:54:51.105 --> 02:54:55.829]  Um... Bill Gates and his father, who ran Planned Parenthood, are right.
[02:54:57.450 --> 02:55:02.174]  We need to dumb down, sterilize, and abort as many people as we can.
[02:55:03.319 --> 02:55:11.073]  We need to put as much fluoride in the water of those that are born to dumb them down as much as possible so they're more easily managed.
[02:55:11.674 --> 02:55:15.481]  You see, I've decided to try to join Bill Gates and try to start thinking like him.
[02:55:16.263 --> 02:55:21.007]  Worldwide, he directed genetically engineered mosquitos to bite us and give us diseases.
[02:55:21.507 --> 02:55:23.589]  But he said it was in the name of helping people.
[02:55:24.169 --> 02:55:32.156]  Just like he funded the projects of these, quote, sterilized male mosquitos that would go out in Brazil and cause the other mosquito populations to implode.
[02:55:32.176 --> 02:55:35.558]  But now they mutated and the numbers exploded!
[02:55:36.059 --> 02:55:39.261]  And suddenly the mosquitos are making people much sicker.
[02:55:40.042 --> 02:55:42.784]  Oh, it wasn't a mistake, none of it was!
[02:55:42.824 --> 02:55:43.385]  Now, Malarius,
[02:55:44.085 --> 02:55:45.746]  Of course, transmitted by mosquitoes.
[02:55:46.227 --> 02:55:47.127]  I brought some here.
[02:55:47.568 --> 02:55:54.093]  There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
[02:55:54.193 --> 02:55:56.955]  Let me tell you, except 5G, 4G, 3G, it's killing us all.
[02:55:56.975 --> 02:55:57.355]  We deserve to die.
[02:55:58.176 --> 02:56:00.417]  And don't go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:56:00.657 --> 02:56:01.118]  Oh, no.
[02:56:01.678 --> 02:56:04.200]  Don't get high-quality fish oil or turmeric.
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:05.661]  It fights inflammation.
[02:56:05.901 --> 02:56:07.923]  Don't get any of the great antioxidants we have.
[02:56:08.223 --> 02:56:11.786]  Don't get ultimate bone broth that's selling out at 50% off.
[02:56:11.826 --> 02:56:12.706]  It's the last week to get it.
[02:56:13.387 --> 02:56:19.091]  We don't support organizations and institutions that are independent and fighting for a pro-human future.
[02:56:19.972 --> 02:56:24.756]  Roll over to Bella Melinda Gates, the rightful rulers of this earth.
[02:56:25.576 --> 02:56:29.099]  Do not go to Infowarsstore.com and support me.
[02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:32.141]  And do not spread the articles and videos.
[02:56:32.602 --> 02:56:33.983]  Just give up and submit.
[02:56:34.303 --> 02:56:36.044]  Give your children over to Billy Boy.
[02:56:36.705 --> 02:56:37.786]  Truth is Satan's good.
[02:56:41.041 --> 02:56:43.948]  Alright, thanks for watching, and thank you Bill Gates for all you do.
[02:56:44.008 --> 02:56:45.111]  Thanks for those mosquitoes.
[02:56:45.452 --> 02:56:46.414]  Thanks for 5G.
[02:56:46.735 --> 02:56:47.658]  Thanks for the chemtrails.
