[00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:24.296]  The most banned of the most banned of the big megatech titans and the corrupt armies of anti-free speech SJWs.
[00:00:24.296 --> 00:00:37.186]  Facebook put out a statement yesterday and they said, of the four people we've banned, three being conservatives, Farrakhan was the cover to make it not look political, Alex Jones is a new category.
[00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:40.009]  His name and his website
[00:00:40.976 --> 00:00:44.059]  Will not be spoken or texted.
[00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.783]  They even got live systems now on their apps where they're going to listen to what you're saying in live time.
[00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:55.790]  And if you speak the word, Alex Jones, you will be banned.
[00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.732]  Unbelievable.
[00:00:57.732 --> 00:01:01.735]  20,000 Southern Poverty Law Center operatives now inside Facebook.
[00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:03.277]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:10.894]  Ladies and gentlemen, it all crystallized at about 5.30 in the morning.
[00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:12.595]  I went to bed last night at about 10.
[00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:17.198]  I got up at 5.30, took a shower, had some coffee at about 5.45.
[00:01:17.198 --> 00:01:19.739]  Everything crystallized.
[00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:28.243]  And then I got on the phone with three different lawyers this morning and discussed it all with them and they said, absolutely, this is the lawsuit.
[00:01:28.243 --> 00:01:31.405]  We have them.
[00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:33.186]  You remember a month ago, back in late March,
[00:01:34.224 --> 00:01:49.615]  A little over a month ago, those internal emails came out in Business Insider of Facebook, and their own people saying, Jones is not making anti-Semitic remarks, and so we can't take him down.
[00:01:49.615 --> 00:01:56.220]  And then that was leaked out to the press, and they put pressure on him, so they went ahead with it and said I was anti-Semitic and banned me.
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.982]  It'd be one thing if you argue you're a private company, you can ban somebody.
[00:01:59.738 --> 00:02:13.349]  But you're going to surveil your users in real time and tell them what words they can use or what they can discuss, and you're then going to put out a giant press release saying that I'm a hate leader when your own internal findings were it wasn't true.
[00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.249]  And so what if I was?
[00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.290]  Everybody deserves free speech.
[00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.331]  But I'm not.
[00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:21.975]  So you have defamed me while trying to bankrupt me and stop my free speech.
[00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:25.098]  This is authoritarianism writ large.
[00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.087]  And when it rains, it pours.
[00:02:28.087 --> 00:02:29.489]  Paul Watson was supposed to be on today.
[00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.751]  He's got a very ill family member.
[00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:37.296]  So I'm going to be private about that, but pray for Paul and his parents and Steve.
[00:02:37.296 --> 00:02:39.078]  Paul, I wouldn't even say is devastated.
[00:02:39.078 --> 00:02:41.000]  He's really upset about humanity.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.882]  People are calling me saying, how are you handling this?
[00:02:42.882 --> 00:02:46.005]  I mean, I'm fine.
[00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:49.569]  I'm not any of these things they say, but we've got some serious criminals here.
[00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:55.089]  And MasterCard's announcing they're going to monitor all your purchases now.
[00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.311]  And if they think you buy at a hate site, you're going to be banned from using it.
[00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:01.213]  This is the Chinese social credit score.
[00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:04.615]  And so many people I know are deciding to just say, well, I'm going to submit to it.
[00:03:04.615 --> 00:03:09.058]  My God, are we Americans or what the hell are we?
[00:03:09.058 --> 00:03:11.700]  Well, Alex, these are mobsters.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.501]  We better back down.
[00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.017]  Wow, we've really turned into a nation of chicken necks.
[00:03:18.017 --> 00:03:21.524]  Not this great audience though, they fear you because of your strength and your will, but...
[00:03:23.607 --> 00:03:25.488]  I fired the bat signal out yesterday.
[00:03:25.488 --> 00:03:28.070]  Halfway through the show, I found out this was happening.
[00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.852]  We had important coverage of it, but I was still floundering around.
[00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:34.814]  Met three hours with Robert Barnes, a great lawyer who was here.
[00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:39.316]  We figured a lot of this out, going over the documents together until about nine at night.
[00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:40.477]  And then it all hit this morning.
[00:03:40.477 --> 00:03:41.918]  So I'm going to fire the bat signal again.
[00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:44.079]  I'm not mad if Drudge doesn't link the top again.
[00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:50.763]  But I'm going to lay out for you, total smoking gun, their internal emails.
[00:03:51.923 --> 00:03:56.525]  Which their own people leaked, but I'm now going to bite them in the ass royal.
[00:03:56.525 --> 00:03:59.966]  Where they said, this man has done nothing, like Pontius Pilate said.
[00:03:59.966 --> 00:04:02.387]  I'm not comparing myself to Christ, but it's the same deal.
[00:04:02.387 --> 00:04:08.269]  They said, we don't like him, we're liberals, but he's not done anything they say he's done.
[00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.190]  And they said, you will crucify him.
[00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.951]  And they washed their hands.
[00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:15.391]  It's all
[00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:17.670]  Right here.
[00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.591]  This is incredible.
[00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:23.953]  So they go after Farrakhan, who has said anti-Jewish stuff.
[00:04:23.953 --> 00:04:25.014]  That's his right to say it.
[00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:27.195]  I don't agree with it, but that's his right.
[00:04:27.195 --> 00:04:30.417]  To throw him in the grab bag.
[00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:31.958]  And you had all the concerted media.
[00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:32.819]  They jumped the gun.
[00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.161]  Hundreds of papers an hour before said, Jones has been taken down.
[00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:38.242]  It's like, oh, you went an hour early.
[00:04:38.242 --> 00:04:39.783]  All coordinated by Oliver Darcy.
[00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:50.649]  And then Oliver Darcy says that he wants conservatives banned off of any texting app where you can't even text your family.
[00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:56.094]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarians are here and they're moving against humanity.
[00:04:56.094 --> 00:04:57.336]  Trump must take action.
[00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.512]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:14.076]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:05:14.076 --> 00:05:17.058]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:05:17.058 --> 00:05:18.798]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:05:18.798 --> 00:05:25.081]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[00:05:27.162 --> 00:05:32.505]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[00:05:32.505 --> 00:05:35.447]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[00:05:35.447 --> 00:05:39.329]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[00:05:39.329 --> 00:05:43.371]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:05:43.371 --> 00:05:45.172]  I've got two in my home.
[00:05:45.172 --> 00:05:51.275]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:52.136]  Don't live
[00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:57.018]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[00:05:57.018 --> 00:06:03.560]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.241]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:11.343]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:34.475 --> 00:06:40.276]  Well, I don't want to say that I'm pleased as punch today, but I'm pretty darn close.
[00:06:40.276 --> 00:06:53.318]  The globalists are already censoring and surveilling and big-brothering everybody at levels lightyears down a black hole compared to 1984 and George Orwell's nightmare vision.
[00:06:53.318 --> 00:07:02.140]  They're just rolling the censorship out and letting you know about the control and the surveillance using straw men that they've built up
[00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:12.237]  Louis Farrakhan's, Alex Jones's, so they can then have you accept it when you're really accepting your own fate and your own doom.
[00:07:12.237 --> 00:07:31.333]  Now, I've been on the air 24 and a half years, and I'm about to lay out for you, ladies and gentlemen, information that is hands down the most important information I've ever covered.
[00:07:34.411 --> 00:07:52.320]  You ever been driving through the fog in the mountains and you come around a turn and the fog's gone and you see the sun rising and you can see 50 miles and it's just incredibly clear and you can look down in the valleys and you can see the stars still out even though the sun's coming up?
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.001]  You ever have one of those magic moments?
[00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:56.482]  This is the opposite of that.
[00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:04.833]  I've got all the pieces, and I've been too close to the problem for a while, but last night and this morning, it all crystallized.
[00:08:04.833 --> 00:08:26.623]  We have their exact battle plan, how they're going to roll it out, but you would only know this if you were engrossed in it, if you were focused on it, and if you were experiencing the attacks and in legal battles with these individuals and all of their different operatives to then see the scripting, the coordination, and then even get the documents where they're coordinating it.
[00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:30.531]  The live feed is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:33.273]  It's titled, Smoking Gun.
[00:08:33.273 --> 00:08:39.198]  Internal Facebook docs reveal plan to muzzle conservatives ahead of 2020.
[00:08:39.198 --> 00:08:44.382]  Facebook admits Jones banned for political reasons, not anti-Semitism.
[00:08:44.382 --> 00:08:49.005]  Now I want to explain to everybody listening.
[00:08:49.005 --> 00:08:51.567]  Please, this is not about Alex Jones.
[00:08:51.567 --> 00:08:53.108]  This is not about Louis Farrakhan.
[00:08:53.108 --> 00:08:55.010]  This is not about Milo Yiannopoulos.
[00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.091]  This is not about Laura Loomer.
[00:08:57.674 --> 00:09:02.816]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[00:09:02.816 --> 00:09:12.260]  It is being announced in the name of defeating me and you, the populist, that they're going to ban links in live time.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:25.106]  They're going to have moderators on your phone when you have a app through any of these companies, including Facebook, that are going to be watching what you're watching and doing and reading your text messages.
[00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.867]  You're like, well yeah, they already have Alexa in my house.
[00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.588]  Listen to me.
[00:09:29.588 --> 00:09:32.709]  Think about the magnitude of that.
[00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:42.831]  Remember Oliver Darcy two years ago was inside my YouTube account and was reporting on who our sponsors were and how much I was being paid.
[00:09:42.831 --> 00:09:50.293]  Just like Facebook is giving all their internal documents to Business Insider and Atlantic Monthly to talk about all this private stuff.
[00:09:50.293 --> 00:09:52.374]  This is criminal!
[00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:53.454]  These are corporations
[00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:01.953]  With your information, teamed up with big tech to slaughter free speech and surveil people.
[00:10:01.953 --> 00:10:17.443]  And Oliver Darcy said yesterday, we're going to play the clip, get ready for this, that they're going to ban people talking to each other over the phone in live time and text messages.
[00:10:17.443 --> 00:10:20.185]  He said, we're looking to see if Jones has an iPhone right now.
[00:10:20.185 --> 00:10:22.686]  We're in his iPhone.
[00:10:22.686 --> 00:10:23.287]  He says it's on air.
[00:10:26.573 --> 00:10:32.060]  And we're seeing if he's got WhatsApp, which is just where you text, message, or call people.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.324]  See, now it's down to you talking to your mama.
[00:10:35.324 --> 00:10:42.032]  And he's on there saying, well, we know he's got an iPhone, but we're checking into it right now to see what he's doing.
[00:10:46.018 --> 00:10:50.320]  Because Brazil got their new great president elected via text messages.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.501]  I've been telling you folks, circumnavigate them with text messages.
[00:10:53.501 --> 00:10:56.202]  Now they want your text messages!
[00:10:56.202 --> 00:10:57.943]  The arrogance of CNN!
[00:10:57.943 --> 00:11:03.145]  So let me lay out the big quadrants here of bombshell info.
[00:11:03.145 --> 00:11:12.869]  Number one, they admit AI is now censoring in live time with machine learning, working with 20,000 SJW Southern Poverty Law Center trained individuals.
[00:11:12.869 --> 00:11:13.449]  This is all public.
[00:11:14.178 --> 00:11:21.301]  They've now turned AI on, with humans working with it, to train it to know what a satire is.
[00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:24.203]  Because the machine still can't tell if something's satire.
[00:11:24.203 --> 00:11:28.545]  Like, everybody's now saying, Alex Jones is deplorable, Alex Jones is evil, and then putting my stuff out.
[00:11:28.545 --> 00:11:32.646]  Because Facebook said, as long as you decry him and say he's bad, you can talk about him.
[00:11:32.646 --> 00:11:35.048]  Any positive, you are banned.
[00:11:35.048 --> 00:11:35.848]  Or it's removed.
[00:11:35.848 --> 00:11:38.309]  And it's currently happening, it's all over the news.
[00:11:38.309 --> 00:11:41.510]  Where thousands of emails are coming in, it's happening to everyone.
[00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.251]  It's in live time.
[00:11:43.459 --> 00:11:50.585]  But the computers can't tell if you say, he's a child molester, I hate Alex Jones, he's worse than Satan.
[00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:51.786]  They let it go through.
[00:11:51.786 --> 00:11:59.473]  And you all have my permission, you can say, Jones is Satan, he's the scum of the earth, here's a link to his show, and listen to this devil.
[00:11:59.473 --> 00:12:02.995]  But that's why there's still the humans overseeing it.
[00:12:02.995 --> 00:12:10.322]  It flags by the AI, they go in, this is all admitted, and then they decide, is that satire or is that serious?
[00:12:12.022 --> 00:12:13.984]  But they're SJWs.
[00:12:13.984 --> 00:12:14.704]  They're sociopaths.
[00:12:14.704 --> 00:12:17.027]  They're lacking souls, we've kind of figured out.
[00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:20.550]  They can't tell either, because they're not human either.
[00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.572]  Ooh, that's a big secret, isn't it?
[00:12:22.572 --> 00:12:24.593]  Yeah, they don't have their humanity.
[00:12:24.593 --> 00:12:27.256]  It's very sad, but see, this is happening.
[00:12:27.256 --> 00:12:28.697]  Now, let's get into this right now.
[00:12:28.697 --> 00:12:29.358]  That's why they can't meme.
[00:12:32.608 --> 00:12:34.449]  This is so incredible.
[00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:42.733]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're saying if you say my name or InfoWars in even just a neutral light, this is an official press release, you will be banned.
[00:12:42.733 --> 00:12:44.814]  The outrageousness of that is next level.
[00:12:44.814 --> 00:12:47.776]  And of course that will be deployed against everybody.
[00:12:47.776 --> 00:12:48.616]  That's the rollout.
[00:12:48.616 --> 00:12:50.677]  I'm just the rollout, first domino.
[00:12:50.677 --> 00:13:00.763]  Then, they admit that they're surveilling all of you in live time while they do that and are in your phone and in your computer and in your devices.
[00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.210]  This is just Facebook.
[00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:03.931]  They're all doing it.
[00:13:03.931 --> 00:13:05.731]  All the big tech giants.
[00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:06.491]  This is the architecture.
[00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:09.192]  This is the plan.
[00:13:09.192 --> 00:13:22.557]  And on top of it, in their own internal documents, they admit that they are censoring conservatives, and framing them, and designating them so they can be banned, and admitting that I'm really not an anti-Semite.
[00:13:22.557 --> 00:13:26.478]  So they say, he's not guilty of this, but we'll just say he is, and so then there's the defamation.
[00:13:31.738 --> 00:13:35.946]  So there's so many angles to this that it's just incredible.
[00:13:35.946 --> 00:13:36.908]  They're surveilling you.
[00:13:36.908 --> 00:13:40.676]  They're going to control who you can call and who you can text message.
[00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.229]  Oh, it's a private company, though.
[00:13:45.229 --> 00:13:47.030]  No, folks, there's Supreme Court rulings.
[00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.991]  They can't do this.
[00:13:47.991 --> 00:13:49.272]  It's all illegal.
[00:13:49.272 --> 00:13:50.353]  It's surveillance.
[00:13:50.353 --> 00:13:51.514]  It's immoral.
[00:13:51.514 --> 00:13:52.754]  And it's so horrible.
[00:13:52.754 --> 00:14:04.163]  And the dying corporate media is basically blackmailing the big tech giants to let them share the power and let them be part of the mop-up crew ending freedom in the West.
[00:14:04.163 --> 00:14:09.407]  And so for a season or so, a few years, they'll still have jobs, but they're all going to be out of jobs, too.
[00:14:09.407 --> 00:14:10.968]  I mean, this is such a betrayal.
[00:14:12.313 --> 00:14:16.174]  of humanity, but they trained the anti-free speech people at the colleges.
[00:14:16.174 --> 00:14:39.319]  Now they're deploying what the Associated Press is calling today, human rights committees into every major corporation like MasterCard, like a bioethics board that decides, you know, who lives, who dies, to where they're going to surveil with AI your purchases on MasterCard, and if they don't like what you're buying, they'll turn customers' cards off now.
[00:14:39.319 --> 00:14:40.119]  It's not take
[00:14:40.939 --> 00:14:46.045]  MasterCard away from Alex Jones, or take it away from Laura Loomer, that's already happening.
[00:14:46.045 --> 00:14:49.108]  It's take MasterCard from you.
[00:14:49.108 --> 00:14:52.372]  You're like, well I'll go to something else.
[00:14:52.372 --> 00:14:54.414]  No, they're buying it all up.
[00:14:54.414 --> 00:14:54.775]  It's here.
[00:14:54.775 --> 00:14:55.996]  Mark of the Beast, folks.
[00:14:55.996 --> 00:14:59.040]  Whether you believe in God or not, it's happening.
[00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:10.394]  And these people are reading Revelation, the last book of the New Testament, and they've decided that it's an owner's manual, that it's an operations guide, that it's a blueprint for something they're building.
[00:15:10.394 --> 00:15:11.295]  And they're doing it.
[00:15:11.295 --> 00:15:12.656]  They're manifesting it.
[00:15:12.656 --> 00:15:14.498]  They're building the system.
[00:15:14.498 --> 00:15:18.180]  And the churches won't say a word because they like all their digital stuff.
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.582]  They like being on Facebook.
[00:15:19.582 --> 00:15:21.483]  See how the Antichrist works?
[00:15:21.483 --> 00:15:22.944]  You see how it works?
[00:15:24.611 --> 00:15:28.453]  So, this is unbelievable.
[00:15:28.453 --> 00:15:30.954]  All premeditated political setup.
[00:15:30.954 --> 00:15:32.634]  You say, well why is it happening?
[00:15:32.634 --> 00:15:33.675]  Why won't Trump stop it?
[00:15:33.675 --> 00:15:37.596]  Because it's all the banks, it's all the corporations, the NSA runs it all.
[00:15:37.596 --> 00:15:39.477]  It's the architecture of the future.
[00:15:39.477 --> 00:15:43.519]  The big digital brain we all interface with and upload to.
[00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:46.060]  DARPA admits that's the plan, so that's what they built.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.741]  That's what it is.
[00:15:47.741 --> 00:15:49.161]  It's always going to be that way.
[00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:50.382]  It was never not going to be that way.
[00:15:51.508 --> 00:15:55.613]  And now, I am patient zero.
[00:15:55.613 --> 00:15:58.016]  I'm actually honored to have the antichrist system ban me first.
[00:15:59.269 --> 00:16:01.149]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.

[00:20:03.389 --> 00:20:06.005]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:29.694 --> 00:20:44.152]  I want to thank Matt Drudge, DrudgeReport.com, the second largest site in the world, the largest news site in the world.
[00:20:49.483 --> 00:20:54.264]  For standing up for free speech when so many other people have abandoned it.
[00:20:54.264 --> 00:20:57.805]  And so many so-called conservatives are celebrating Farrakhan being censored.
[00:20:57.805 --> 00:21:04.006]  Farrakhan was thrown in because he's a hated figure by conservatives, so that you would then accept censorship.
[00:21:04.006 --> 00:21:05.046]  It's a total trap!
[00:21:05.046 --> 00:21:08.807]  But let's go back to DrudgeReport.com.
[00:21:08.807 --> 00:21:10.928]  There's the headline, Alex Jones fights back.
[00:21:10.928 --> 00:21:13.128]  And that's exactly what's happening here.
[00:21:13.128 --> 00:21:15.829]  This evil system is going to come and go.
[00:21:15.829 --> 00:21:16.529]  When we look back,
[00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:28.620]  On this time, people are going to be amazed that we ever let these companies put surveillance systems with microphones and cameras in our houses.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.325]  I told you that was the plan 20 years ago.
[00:21:32.325 --> 00:21:36.330]  Almost everything we've talked about has turned out to be right because we're going off their own blueprints.
[00:21:38.345 --> 00:21:40.746]  And so I'm going to now lay out the facts here.
[00:21:40.746 --> 00:21:43.788]  And I need people to send this link to the WhiteHouse.gov.
[00:21:43.788 --> 00:21:49.430]  I need people to tweet the link that's at DrudgeReport.com from Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:21:49.430 --> 00:22:00.516]  I need people to tweet the article that's posted on the page where we explain that we have the bombshell internal documents where they admit that I didn't do anything anti-Semitic.
[00:22:01.894 --> 00:22:10.240]  And that for political reasons, they needed to designate me as a hate member, whatever that means, a hate leader, so I could be unpersoned.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:31.455]  Proof that I didn't even do what they said according to their rules, and then instead of just banning me, they defamed me with an evil press release, and said that I am the worst of the worst, at a new level, where anyone saying my name, or my website, will be banned or punished.
[00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:41.012]  That's like a movie where the evil guy takes away somebody and if you ever say his name again, you'll go to the gulag.
[00:22:41.012 --> 00:22:44.155]  Good Lord!
[00:22:44.155 --> 00:22:52.982]  They have totally converted the colleges into authoritarian bastions.
[00:22:52.982 --> 00:22:55.024]  This country is dangerous now.
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.801]  And I'll say this.
[00:22:57.801 --> 00:22:59.002]  I like President Trump a lot.
[00:22:59.002 --> 00:22:59.803]  He's done a lot of good.
[00:22:59.803 --> 00:23:01.344]  And the enemy sure hates him.
[00:23:01.344 --> 00:23:03.826]  He's trying to get rid of him, but he's not done enough.
[00:23:03.826 --> 00:23:09.550]  And on this situation with the draconian censorship, he's only taken action at the colleges.
[00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.373]  And I'm yet to see the government lawsuits over that when they ban people's speech.
[00:23:13.373 --> 00:23:14.834]  But it's already had some effect.
[00:23:14.834 --> 00:23:17.696]  We need relief, Mr. President.
[00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:18.337]  We need it now.
[00:23:19.984 --> 00:23:22.506]  I am pro-Israel.
[00:23:22.506 --> 00:23:23.967]  Everybody's always known that.
[00:23:23.967 --> 00:23:32.474]  I've been on air 24 years, and I think that Israel's a better nation than a lot of those other nations, and there's no reason to turn it over to the Islamics.
[00:23:32.474 --> 00:23:33.714]  They'll blow it up.
[00:23:33.714 --> 00:23:35.696]  They'll fight over it, like they always do.
[00:23:35.696 --> 00:23:38.978]  But the point is to say that I'm anti-Semitic.
[00:23:38.978 --> 00:23:40.359]  It's in all the news.
[00:23:40.359 --> 00:23:45.924]  It says Jones banned Washington Post, New York Times, everywhere, for anti-Semitic posts, and he's anti-Semitic.
[00:23:46.807 --> 00:23:48.688]  is really sick.
[00:23:48.688 --> 00:24:01.638]  You know, I was so colorblind or blind to all that, when I got married to my first wife, who's half-Jewish, I had no idea what I was getting myself into with a white supremacist, with the things they'd said about my children.
[00:24:01.638 --> 00:24:13.086]  And it's really evil of the leftist media and of leftist Jews in the media to call me an anti-Semite and then defend Ilhar Omar and all these real anti-Semites
[00:24:14.008 --> 00:24:16.330]  And all these other people that literally want to get rid of Israel.
[00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.633]  You guys are the scum of the earth.
[00:24:18.633 --> 00:24:22.817]  I don't care if you're black, white, old, young, Jewish, Christian, whatever.
[00:24:22.817 --> 00:24:25.319]  You know you're lying about me in the press.
[00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:30.724]  And it just shows me what dirty sacks of garbage you are.
[00:24:30.724 --> 00:24:33.247]  What dirty sacks of garbage you are.
[00:24:40.285 --> 00:24:46.795]  You know, that's what they called me in a bunch of headlines was Alex Jones is a sack of garbage.
[00:24:46.795 --> 00:24:47.396]  Really.
[00:24:47.396 --> 00:24:49.139]  Well, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:24:49.139 --> 00:24:49.880]  I got a lot done.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.861]  I have a lot of energy.
[00:24:50.861 --> 00:24:51.502]  I have a great life.
[00:24:51.502 --> 00:24:52.544]  I have a great family.
[00:24:52.544 --> 00:24:54.787]  I look at you leftists, man, and I'm telling you, I didn't know they could stack.
[00:24:56.755 --> 00:24:57.736]  Trash that high.
[00:24:57.736 --> 00:24:58.876]  And I don't feel good about that.
[00:24:58.876 --> 00:25:01.317]  I look at you and you don't have any honor.
[00:25:01.317 --> 00:25:02.178]  You don't have any will.
[00:25:02.178 --> 00:25:04.259]  You don't have any compassion.
[00:25:04.259 --> 00:25:08.601]  And everything you say we are is what you are.
[00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:09.582]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:25:09.582 --> 00:25:10.962]  I believe in real freedom.
[00:25:10.962 --> 00:25:12.903]  I believe in egalitarianism.
[00:25:12.903 --> 00:25:14.464]  I believe in the West.
[00:25:14.464 --> 00:25:15.385]  I'm a liberal.
[00:25:15.385 --> 00:25:16.085]  You're not.
[00:25:16.085 --> 00:25:25.030]  You're leftist, left-hand path, power mongering, power cult of control freaks that are dangerous, that are classical authoritarians.
[00:25:26.912 --> 00:25:33.534]  And you've been created on these universities and created through the television system in Hollywood.
[00:25:33.534 --> 00:25:34.215]  Unbelievable.
[00:25:34.215 --> 00:25:35.375]  So we're going to go to break.
[00:25:35.375 --> 00:25:38.056]  Longer segment coming up and I'm going to go through it all.
[00:25:38.056 --> 00:25:46.079]  CNN now says they want conservatives banned off of using text and phone call apps that are digital.
[00:25:46.079 --> 00:25:48.119]  This is all NSA technology.
[00:25:48.119 --> 00:25:48.860]  They can listen to you.
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:49.580]  They can control you.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.780]  They can pop in.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.021]  And they're now just telling you they are.
[00:25:53.951 --> 00:26:05.836]  They're now saying they're going to take your credit cards away and they're going to watch the purchases you make and punish you with committees of human rights right out of Maoist China.
[00:26:05.836 --> 00:26:08.497]  I mean, folks, this is the Chinese model.
[00:26:08.497 --> 00:26:14.720]  Google and Apple and others went over there and set it up for them.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.041]  These people are so dangerous.
[00:26:17.041 --> 00:26:22.343]  And look at Zuckerberg and the power trip he's on and his testimony and just who he is.
[00:26:22.343 --> 00:26:23.224]  It's disgusting.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.741]  So these organizations are enemies of the people.
[00:26:28.741 --> 00:26:30.983]  They're enemies of open free societies.
[00:26:30.983 --> 00:26:33.705]  And they're the ones that are dangerous.
[00:26:33.705 --> 00:26:36.446]  And they're the ones that have a monopoly over the transfer of information.
[00:26:36.446 --> 00:26:38.888]  They almost have a monopoly.
[00:26:38.888 --> 00:26:41.930]  And God help us if they get their monopoly.
[00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.052]  So again, I'm going to break this down.
[00:26:45.052 --> 00:26:51.836]  They are saying that if you share InfoWars or my name, unless it's negative, you'll be punished.
[00:26:54.366 --> 00:26:57.307]  That is re-education camp behavior.
[00:26:57.307 --> 00:26:58.447]  By the way, I didn't see it in my stacks.
[00:26:58.447 --> 00:27:00.968]  Will you pull me the InfoWars article?
[00:27:00.968 --> 00:27:02.569]  It's up on InfoWars.
[00:27:02.569 --> 00:27:04.630]  I'm sure it's here, but I missed it.
[00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:12.272]  He's now going to convert you to group living rooms where you won't be able to have your own private Facebook, because they're already in it anyways.
[00:27:12.272 --> 00:27:13.333]  They're already in your living room.
[00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:14.373]  They're already in your photos.
[00:27:14.373 --> 00:27:15.573]  They're already got your passcodes.
[00:27:15.573 --> 00:27:17.174]  They're already shelling your dad and everybody.
[00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:20.952]  In an orgy free-for-all.
[00:27:20.952 --> 00:27:27.954]  Now you're going to be in these living rooms with other people that they put you with for social engineering, like a dorm.
[00:27:27.954 --> 00:27:34.257]  And they're going to re-educate you, and then they're going to decide, your friends are going to decide what gets boosted and what doesn't.
[00:27:34.257 --> 00:27:38.238]  Again, that's literally a re-education camp model.
[00:27:38.238 --> 00:27:41.679]  Facebook CEO promotes group living rooms.
[00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:43.340]  What's Zuckerberg really after?
[00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:47.821]  People can have more revealing, intimate conversations.
[00:27:47.821 --> 00:27:58.647]  Yeah, how about you just take us over to the local sports stadium and play movies all night telling us how much America sucks and people that give in and turn against their families and tattle and join the club next week and be a guard inside the facility.
[00:27:58.647 --> 00:28:02.569]  I mean, we're getting classical re-education camp garbage.
[00:28:02.569 --> 00:28:06.611]  Remember that was in the Army manual that Obama put out eight years ago?
[00:28:06.611 --> 00:28:11.994]  Classical re-education camp garbage projected through the internet.
[00:28:11.994 --> 00:28:13.935]  This is beyond authoritarian.
[00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:31.876]  So they're gonna surveil you, they're gonna watch you, they're gonna track you, and then they're gonna defame you, and tell lies about you, and they want your car, they want your house, they want your bank account, they want your mind, they want your children, they want your soul, they want it all.
[00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:33.398]  We want your soul.
[00:28:33.398 --> 00:28:34.359]  That's it.
[00:28:36.462 --> 00:28:38.383]  Because after all, let him into your living room.
[00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:41.646]  He already gives you devices where they listen and watch you.
[00:28:41.646 --> 00:28:45.508]  Little camera devices in your house for your family that track you.
[00:28:45.508 --> 00:28:48.891]  Now he's in your living room and he's going to tell you how to live.
[00:28:48.891 --> 00:28:49.952]  He's going to run your life.
[00:28:49.952 --> 00:28:52.313]  He's your cult leader.
[00:28:52.313 --> 00:28:53.254]  This is what Big Tech is.
[00:28:53.254 --> 00:28:58.458]  It's a big giant cult leader takeover with four companies bidding for command of the cult.
[00:28:59.498 --> 00:29:06.681]  Hey guys, it's Scott Bauer here, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.
[00:29:06.681 --> 00:29:08.542]  Are you looking for a super hot stock tip?
[00:29:08.542 --> 00:29:12.424]  Here at Prosper, we are always looking for exciting opportunities in the markets.
[00:29:12.424 --> 00:29:16.246]  And right now, all my students are salivating over this stock we are watching.

[00:29:22.388 --> 00:29:23.729]  I just need to know where to send it.

[00:29:30.254 --> 00:29:32.156]  How do I know this stock is so hot?
[00:29:32.156 --> 00:29:41.624]  Well, I'm a former CBOE market maker for Amazon Options, former Vice President of Goldman Sachs, and I have over 25 years of professional trading experience.
[00:29:41.624 --> 00:29:43.626]  I'm telling you, this stock is hot.
[00:29:43.626 --> 00:29:47.349]  But be warned, the stock may move soon, so you need to claim it before it does.
[00:29:47.349 --> 00:29:48.050]  Text HOT.
[00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:53.712]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:29:53.712 --> 00:29:54.032]  It's you!
[00:30:09.551 --> 00:30:11.733]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:30:11.733 --> 00:30:20.439]  It is you, the info warriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:30:20.439 --> 00:30:25.043]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:30:25.043 --> 00:30:26.504]  You are the info war.
[00:30:26.504 --> 00:30:30.027]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:30:30.707 --> 00:30:33.108]  We are the renaissance and we are winning!
[00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:04.283]  BrainForce Plus is a top-tier nootropin.
[00:31:04.283 --> 00:31:07.386]  Focus, clarity, energy.

[00:32:00.276 --> 00:32:04.238]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:04.238 --> 00:32:07.520]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:13.783]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:13.783 --> 00:32:16.565]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:17.285 --> 00:32:21.108]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:21.108 --> 00:32:27.593]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:27.593 --> 00:32:32.557]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:33.294 --> 00:32:37.217]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:37.217 --> 00:32:44.421]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:44.421 --> 00:32:49.645]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:49.645 --> 00:32:55.348]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:55.348 --> 00:32:59.311]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:11.244]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.244 --> 00:33:13.304]  We want your soul!
[00:33:13.304 --> 00:33:16.646]  We want your soul!
[00:33:16.646 --> 00:33:20.608]  We want your soul!
[00:33:20.608 --> 00:33:25.490]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.070]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:11.881 --> 00:34:12.747]  Here's Britney.
[00:34:12.747 --> 00:34:13.271]  Here's Cole.
[00:34:41.542 --> 00:34:48.948]  And all the studies, all of them show that people's IQs are dropping, their brainwaves are dropping, they're not vigorous, they're not alive.
[00:34:48.948 --> 00:34:52.511]  The more you spend time on social media, the more depressed you are.
[00:34:52.511 --> 00:35:00.658]  And Sean Parker, the former deputy head of Facebook, came out last year and said, we designed it to make you depressed and to run your life.
[00:35:00.658 --> 00:35:05.001]  And now we're going to replace real people with bots that control your life.
[00:35:05.001 --> 00:35:07.663]  And he said, I think it's immoral and people better watch out.
[00:35:08.544 --> 00:35:19.590]  So even forerunners in this, who are pretty sociopathic, have come out and said, you're in a lot of danger, you better watch out.
[00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.011]  Think about that.
[00:35:21.011 --> 00:35:25.273]  So, I need everybody to go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:35:25.273 --> 00:35:32.337]  I need everybody to go to DrudgeReport.com, and right there on the left hand side is the links, and send out that link.
[00:35:32.337 --> 00:35:33.638]  This could backfire on them.
[00:35:33.638 --> 00:35:35.159]  We need to fight back against it and say,
[00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.751]  Oh Alex Jones?
[00:35:36.751 --> 00:35:37.933]  You can't say the name Alex Jones?
[00:35:37.933 --> 00:35:40.096]  You can't say the name Infowars.com?
[00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:42.099]  Well then we're going to say it.
[00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:43.441]  And play along with their sick game.
[00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:51.193]  I'm going to read the press release in a moment where it says you can only say his name or his website if it is to condemn him and say he's bad.
[00:35:52.566 --> 00:35:54.927]  If you study authoritarian regimes, that's what they do.
[00:35:54.927 --> 00:36:04.233]  They make the public start decrying one person first, then it's another person, then it's a group, then it's everybody, then it's their own family, their own parents, their own children.
[00:36:04.233 --> 00:36:05.374]  This is 1984.
[00:36:05.374 --> 00:36:19.642]  If you just joined us, leaked emails reveal Facebook's intense internal discussions over Alex Jones' anti-Semitic post.
[00:36:19.642 --> 00:36:20.663]  That's from back in March.
[00:36:20.663 --> 00:36:20.983]  Remember that?
[00:36:26.084 --> 00:36:27.625]  Said, well, he didn't say anything anti-semitic.
[00:36:27.625 --> 00:36:29.887]  They go, well, the comments are anti-semitic.
[00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:33.791]  We have these outside leftist publications wanting him banned.
[00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:35.652]  They're reporting we're not doing enough.
[00:36:35.652 --> 00:36:36.393]  What do we do?
[00:36:36.393 --> 00:36:39.596]  And, of course, they're playing a game with the media.
[00:36:39.596 --> 00:36:42.298]  It's Facebook directing the thing from the top.
[00:36:42.298 --> 00:36:43.439]  And we've got the internal documents.
[00:36:43.439 --> 00:36:44.380]  It's all coordinated.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.243]  They go, well, if we could designate him a hate figure, we could ban him, but there's no evidence.
[00:36:48.243 --> 00:36:51.426]  They go, well, the comments, there's a few anti-semitic comments in here.
[00:36:52.918 --> 00:36:56.142]  So they reviewed 560 comments in one post and said, well, only 4% are, and the threshold is 30%.
[00:37:06.277 --> 00:37:09.379]  So they told everybody the threshold to then go make comments.
[00:37:09.379 --> 00:37:18.744]  So the SJWs then all, from their college dormitories, their little jobs they've got interfaced with the Southern Poverty Law Center, their little computer interfaces, they all then go make their anti-semitic comments.
[00:37:18.744 --> 00:37:20.105]  And we've run our own comments before.
[00:37:20.105 --> 00:37:21.526]  We can see the IP addresses.
[00:37:21.526 --> 00:37:23.387]  One guy will say he's black and hates white people.
[00:37:23.387 --> 00:37:25.588]  Another guy says he's white and hates black people.
[00:37:25.588 --> 00:37:26.729]  It's the same IP address.
[00:37:26.729 --> 00:37:27.830]  It's the same person.
[00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.491]  It's the SJWs.
[00:37:29.491 --> 00:37:33.813]  Remember they tried to trick Candace Owens into joining them by having white supremacists threaten her.
[00:37:33.813 --> 00:37:34.454]  It turned out it was
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.642]  It was C.I.A.
[00:37:38.642 --> 00:37:40.583]  people.
[00:37:40.583 --> 00:37:41.104]  And C.I.A.
[00:37:41.104 --> 00:37:43.225]  is not like James Bond or something.
[00:37:43.225 --> 00:37:43.905]  The C.I.A.
[00:37:43.905 --> 00:37:49.509]  are just horrible, evil leftists who want to run the country and terrorize people and run false flags all day.
[00:37:49.509 --> 00:37:52.151]  That's who they are.
[00:37:52.151 --> 00:37:58.475]  Not all the C.I.A., but the bureaucratic ones that interface with the colleges and the infrastructures
[00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:06.014]  People like Balazi Ford's family, and the CIA program she runs.
[00:38:06.014 --> 00:38:07.395]  That's what they do.
[00:38:07.395 --> 00:38:09.437]  They all play damsel in distress.
[00:38:09.437 --> 00:38:14.001]  They all play little victims, but really they're managing the herd.
[00:38:14.001 --> 00:38:17.504]  They're very horrible people.
[00:38:17.504 --> 00:38:23.650]  So they say, if he can be designated a hate figure, we could ban him.
[00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:24.511]  And then a month later,
[00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:32.487]  They get it all packaged, all ready, and roll out with the anti-Semitic angle in their press release, but never show proof because it wasn't there.
[00:38:32.487 --> 00:38:41.834]  So, see, this got countermanded by mid-level managers a month ago, but then it went up the flagpole, and folks said, just go ahead and go with the plan.
[00:38:41.834 --> 00:38:45.237]  They go, well, he never said anything that we could lie about.
[00:38:45.237 --> 00:38:46.378]  Put Louis Faircon in there.
[00:38:48.131 --> 00:38:49.652]  Put Louis Farrakhan in there.
[00:38:49.652 --> 00:38:50.832]  He said stuff.
[00:38:50.832 --> 00:38:52.153]  Which I believe, by the way, he has a right to say.
[00:38:52.153 --> 00:38:53.933]  I'm not saying ban him.
[00:38:53.933 --> 00:38:55.454]  And then they'll just kind of buy it.
[00:38:55.454 --> 00:38:56.254]  But people aren't buying it.
[00:38:56.254 --> 00:38:58.175]  They're like, right-wing figure?
[00:38:58.175 --> 00:39:00.656]  Louis Farrakhan?
[00:39:00.656 --> 00:39:01.856]  So there's all these corrections.
[00:39:01.856 --> 00:39:04.417]  Oh, he's not a right-wing figure.
[00:39:04.417 --> 00:39:06.658]  But it's all pre-packaged.
[00:39:06.658 --> 00:39:10.680]  One hour before all the stuff was taken down, on Instagram and Facebook, it was already published early.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.761]  They jumped the gun.
[00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:16.182]  And Oliver Darcy was coordinating the whole thing again.
[00:39:19.356 --> 00:39:25.057]  Organized slander, libel, and defamation.
[00:39:25.057 --> 00:39:32.959]  And then going all over CNN, all over Fox News, all over MSNBC, all over the place saying Jones was banned for anti-Semitism.
[00:39:32.959 --> 00:39:43.861]  I have a stack of news articles where they've got the media matters and the Washington Post and Care, the Muslim group saying, yeah, Jones is anti-Semitic.
[00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:52.153]  Jones is anti-Semitic and so we had to ban him.
[00:39:52.153 --> 00:40:01.598]  So they don't just ban you, they defame you and lie about you and then don't even care to show their stupid readers and viewers that they were lied to.
[00:40:01.598 --> 00:40:10.264]  So when we come back, I just went through how they premeditated this, how it's the smoking gun, that it's political, that it wasn't done because I'm an anti-Semite.
[00:40:10.264 --> 00:40:12.425]  And again, once you say ban the anti-Semites, then it's everybody.
[00:40:13.234 --> 00:40:14.676]  That's what MasterCard's saying.
[00:40:14.676 --> 00:40:27.290]  Well, if you're going to right-wing or anti-Semitic or anti-Muslim sites, or if you're buying things we think are connected to white supremacists or anybody else we don't like, we're gonna pull your bank account.
[00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.891]  That's right.
[00:40:27.891 --> 00:40:30.153]  They're saying they're gonna surveil your purchases.
[00:40:30.153 --> 00:40:32.456]  They're already surveilling them, but now it's not for fraud!
[00:40:33.564 --> 00:40:35.165]  You bought the wrong magazine.
[00:40:35.165 --> 00:40:37.146]  These people are some crooks, man.
[00:40:37.146 --> 00:40:41.990]  You know, they tried three years ago demonetizing people that criticized Hillary on YouTube.
[00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:43.231]  That didn't work, did it?
[00:40:43.231 --> 00:40:44.712]  So now they moved to banning people.
[00:40:44.712 --> 00:40:46.473]  And now they're saying, we're in your phones.
[00:40:46.473 --> 00:40:51.837]  And now Oliver Darcy, when we come back, says, we're going to control who you can text message on your phone.
[00:40:51.837 --> 00:40:55.019]  We're watching you Americans, so you better shut up!
[00:40:57.222 --> 00:40:59.463]  I actually can't believe they've jumped the shark like this.
[00:40:59.463 --> 00:41:00.984]  I think America's going to reject this.
[00:41:00.984 --> 00:41:01.705]  But you know what?
[00:41:01.705 --> 00:41:06.528]  Trump hasn't done anything yet, so I'm really starting to get suspect to old Trumpy.
[00:41:06.528 --> 00:41:10.690]  I'm really starting to really get worried here at this point.
[00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.532]  And by suspect, I mean either he's got a blind spot, or this is a triple game, or something.
[00:41:14.532 --> 00:41:18.455]  But let me tell you, this is evil and this can't be allowed.
[00:41:18.455 --> 00:41:18.855]  Now listen.
[00:41:20.203 --> 00:41:24.365]  I am, I've sued a few other people, PayPal and others, and we're getting some lawsuits ready.
[00:41:24.365 --> 00:41:30.348]  I have to sue Facebook now, and I have to sue some of the media, and I already warned Business Insider and told them to retract and they didn't.
[00:41:30.348 --> 00:41:40.213]  So, we are going to sue Business Insider, and we are going to sue the writer personally, and we're going to get, we're also going to sue Facebook.
[00:41:40.213 --> 00:41:42.955]  We already have their internal documents submitted and they set me up.
[00:41:42.955 --> 00:41:44.195]  So, they're in a lot of trouble.
[00:41:44.195 --> 00:41:45.336]  It's going to take a lot of money though.
[00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.851]  So listen, I sell high-quality products.
[00:41:48.851 --> 00:41:50.892]  T-shirts, books, films, great supplements.
[00:41:50.892 --> 00:41:56.795]  I need everybody listening to just go to InfoWarstore.com and try our Great Wake of America coffee.
[00:41:56.795 --> 00:42:03.459]  Try our fish oil, try our turmeric bodies, try our great X2, the cleanest iodine out there that's a missing link.
[00:42:03.459 --> 00:42:06.460]  If you're a new viewer or listener, you don't know about the iodine conspiracy, learn about it.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.882]  It's incredible, changed my life, changed so many others.
[00:42:08.882 --> 00:42:11.323]  It has a 98% review rate on Power Reviews.
[00:42:11.323 --> 00:42:12.764]  You get a free bottle of X3 with X2.
[00:42:15.043 --> 00:42:17.564]  Go there and spend money.
[00:42:17.564 --> 00:42:18.864]  I'm going to sue them.
[00:42:18.864 --> 00:42:20.525]  I'm not just going to fight news-wise.
[00:42:20.525 --> 00:42:22.265]  I have to, man.
[00:42:22.265 --> 00:42:29.467]  They say I'm a hate leader and hate Jews when my children have Jewish backgrounds.
[00:42:29.467 --> 00:42:31.608]  I just cannot put up with this crap anymore.
[00:42:31.608 --> 00:42:32.988]  I just can't do it.
[00:42:32.988 --> 00:42:35.629]  And by the way, Zuckerberg, I'm coming to your house with helicopters.
[00:42:35.629 --> 00:42:36.889]  Not over it, but near it.
[00:42:36.889 --> 00:42:38.070]  I'm going to bullhorn your ass.
[00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:39.290]  I'm coming after you.
[00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:40.891]  So you want the gloves off?
[00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:42.151]  Gloves are off, you son of a bitch.
[00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:46.112]  You're a Nazi.
[00:42:46.112 --> 00:42:48.674]  You're just as bad as Hitler.
[00:42:48.674 --> 00:42:53.198]  And so, I'm coming after you, and I'm coming after all of you scumbags.
[00:42:53.198 --> 00:42:54.239]  But hey!
[00:42:54.239 --> 00:42:55.159]  Flood me with money!
[00:42:55.159 --> 00:42:56.821]  You want to make me strong?
[00:42:56.821 --> 00:42:59.603]  Turn me into a giant!
[00:42:59.603 --> 00:43:11.873]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:25.342]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[00:43:25.342 --> 00:43:27.284]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[00:43:27.284 --> 00:43:29.947]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[00:43:31.288 --> 00:43:35.652]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[00:43:35.652 --> 00:43:39.895]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[00:43:39.895 --> 00:43:42.177]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[00:43:42.177 --> 00:43:44.499]  This country is in a war!
[00:43:44.499 --> 00:43:55.209]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[00:43:55.209 --> 00:43:58.792]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[00:43:59.699 --> 00:44:05.729]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:44:05.729 --> 00:44:08.654]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[00:44:08.654 --> 00:44:12.701]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patriotic supply.
[00:44:14.266 --> 00:44:23.412]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[00:44:23.412 --> 00:44:28.775]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[00:44:28.775 --> 00:44:31.036]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[00:44:31.036 --> 00:44:34.558]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[00:44:34.558 --> 00:44:36.039]  They've got special diet foods.
[00:44:36.039 --> 00:44:40.022]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[00:44:40.022 --> 00:44:42.243]  They've got so many great products there.
[00:44:42.243 --> 00:44:43.324]  Have you got a three-year supply?
[00:44:43.784 --> 00:44:45.766]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:48.289]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[00:44:48.289 --> 00:44:53.293]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[00:44:53.293 --> 00:44:58.679]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[00:45:00.267 --> 00:45:10.855]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:45:10.855 --> 00:45:12.917]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:45:12.917 --> 00:45:15.799]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:45:15.799 --> 00:45:17.280]  It's made in the USA.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.423]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:45:20.643 --> 00:45:24.106]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:45:24.106 --> 00:45:26.187]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:45:26.187 --> 00:45:35.894]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:45:35.894 --> 00:45:48.463]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[00:45:48.643 --> 00:45:52.691]  To reignite those rush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:45:52.691 --> 00:45:55.998]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together we're changing the world.
[00:45:55.998 --> 00:45:59.605]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:00.922 --> 00:46:08.286]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[00:46:08.286 --> 00:46:11.368]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:12.989]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[00:46:12.989 --> 00:46:15.670]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:17.151]  You're our only sponsors.
[00:46:17.151 --> 00:46:23.635]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[00:46:23.635 --> 00:46:26.136]  So remember, you are the InfoWar.
[00:46:26.136 --> 00:46:27.957]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.
[00:46:27.957 --> 00:46:29.518]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[00:46:29.918 --> 00:46:35.320]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com that are unprecedented.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:43.043]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:46:43.043 --> 00:46:45.885]  So I want to thank you for your support, and I want to encourage you again.
[00:46:45.885 --> 00:46:50.787]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[00:46:50.787 --> 00:46:53.948]  We have thousands of them, and it makes this all possible.
[00:46:53.948 --> 00:46:56.069]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.509]  God bless you.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:21.063]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.063 --> 00:47:26.804]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:26.804 --> 00:47:31.665]  Strange days have found us
[00:47:34.517 --> 00:47:38.580]  I got a little bit hot there at the end of the segment.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:47.148]  I don't know if Zuckerberg's actually pulling the shots or pulling the punches or doing whatever he's doing there at Facebook, but I tell you this.
[00:47:47.148 --> 00:48:01.219]  I'm sick of them surveilling us, manipulating our lives, telling us what we can read and see, and then they're all with big 20-foot walls around their houses and huge kawaii areas they've taken from natives and just all their arrogance.
[00:48:01.219 --> 00:48:03.141]  There's going to be human action on the ground.
[00:48:04.445 --> 00:48:08.948]  Because it's the left and the globalists trying to harass us in the street and make us uncomfortable.
[00:48:08.948 --> 00:48:13.652]  People like Zuckerberg are going to be made very, very uncomfortable very, very quickly.
[00:48:13.652 --> 00:48:21.197]  Because there is a thing called Newtonian physics, and for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[00:48:21.197 --> 00:48:24.800]  And so I'll just say this to Zuckerberg, and I've got a message for him later.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:29.143]  If this isn't you doing this, then stop it and turn it around.
[00:48:30.444 --> 00:48:37.967]  But if it doesn't get turned around, and I know damn well you end up getting my information from the show, you've talked about it before, then the gloves are off, buddy!
[00:48:37.967 --> 00:48:52.534]  You're not going to sit there and say I was taken off Facebook because I'm an anti-Semite, and all these publications, and then say that if anyone says my name, they get in trouble, without a fight, politically, economically, and legally.
[00:48:52.534 --> 00:48:55.055]  And again, I've already talked to three top lawyers today.
[00:48:55.055 --> 00:48:58.437]  It doesn't matter how much money you have, what you've done, everybody's sick of you.
[00:49:00.572 --> 00:49:13.782]  The fact that you would have internal emails that I haven't done anything anti-semitic a month ago, and then there's a decision by managers not to ban the pages that were still there.
[00:49:13.782 --> 00:49:15.744]  The media put out the lie that I'm supposed to be banned everywhere.
[00:49:15.744 --> 00:49:17.385]  That's not true.
[00:49:17.385 --> 00:49:20.107]  You took me down last year for fake reasons, a few of the pages.
[00:49:20.107 --> 00:49:20.988]  I didn't care about that.
[00:49:20.988 --> 00:49:21.729]  Fine.
[00:49:21.729 --> 00:49:23.090]  It's a bunch of bull.
[00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.612]  But now you're going to take me down because I'm a Nazi?
[00:49:28.021 --> 00:49:32.985]  And then you're going to sit there and say that I'm the worst of the worst in your press release?
[00:49:32.985 --> 00:49:36.728]  That's endangering me and my family, and I'm tired of it.
[00:49:36.728 --> 00:49:44.034]  I'm really sick of the left lying about everybody and being bullies, and you're just not going to get away with it.
[00:49:44.034 --> 00:49:49.879]  But I'll tell listeners again, we need to depose Facebook.
[00:49:49.879 --> 00:49:51.120]  We need to have the court battles.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.862]  We need to be able to go through the motions.
[00:49:52.862 --> 00:49:54.143]  We just have to go ahead and do it.
[00:49:54.143 --> 00:49:54.964]  I have to say, hey,
[00:49:56.593 --> 00:49:59.676]  I have your internal proof you did this to me.
[00:49:59.676 --> 00:50:07.141]  And you're not going to get away with internally saying Jones has done nothing wrong, and then a month later banning me.
[00:50:07.141 --> 00:50:13.066]  If you would have just banned me, I'd say, well, they're censors, this is what they're doing, it needs to be stopped.
[00:50:13.066 --> 00:50:13.967]  They're election meddling.
[00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:20.754]  But when you do it on a mass scale, it's not just me but others.
[00:50:20.754 --> 00:50:24.477]  It just has to stop.
[00:50:24.477 --> 00:50:29.421]  And then you lie to Congress about it, and then there's all the other news.
[00:50:29.421 --> 00:50:42.072]  Not just that you're caught removing me for political purposes and caught lying in your own internal documents, but that now you've got these human rights boards run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a criminal offshore group,
[00:50:44.213 --> 00:50:47.175]  Running around deciding who can have Facebook accounts, who can't.
[00:50:47.175 --> 00:50:48.856]  Put everybody in Facebook jail.
[00:50:48.856 --> 00:50:55.760]  And then you're sharing all the information with people like Oliver Darcy inside people's accounts.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:04.125]  And now you're setting up these group living rooms where it's other people that you go then and share all your stuff together with them.
[00:51:04.125 --> 00:51:07.807]  That's classic re-education camp.
[00:51:07.807 --> 00:51:08.508]  It's mind-blowing.
[00:51:10.993 --> 00:51:17.697]  And it shows you what they're doing ahead of the 2020 election, but it's a lot bigger than the 2020 election, isn't it?
[00:51:17.697 --> 00:51:23.961]  It's about getting everybody used to being surveilled and being controlled.
[00:51:23.961 --> 00:51:39.051]  And at the end of this piece on CNN yesterday, where Oliver Darcy looks like some Winfield gremlin out of a movie, talking about strict action,
[00:51:40.325 --> 00:51:55.773]  And then at the end he says, oh and we need to see if Alex Jones, that means getting to my internal phone, he's finding out with Apple if, and with Facebook and all those other places, if I've got WhatsApp.
[00:51:55.773 --> 00:51:56.453]  Guess that's Facebook.
[00:51:58.499 --> 00:51:59.539]  And I didn't.
[00:51:59.539 --> 00:52:04.981]  But that's like Signal or another dozen things where it's just a digital phone call or a text message.
[00:52:04.981 --> 00:52:09.723]  They now want to get involved in your personal text messages and are surveilling what you're doing.
[00:52:09.723 --> 00:52:11.063]  And he's on national news.
[00:52:11.063 --> 00:52:12.844]  See, that's the next phase.
[00:52:12.844 --> 00:52:13.584]  The next phase is...
[00:52:15.029 --> 00:52:20.492]  On your browser, in your phone, with NewsGuard, and that's a neocon run group, and all this.
[00:52:20.492 --> 00:52:41.683]  So you have the Republican establishment, the Democrat establishment, all moving for censorship, fighting for control of this NSA technology that's been rolled out to the public in the name of Facebook, Twitter, and Google, and we're really involved in private NSA interfaces that are really meant to surveil and control us, and they're unveiling it all now and saying, well, it's because Alex Jones is an anti-Semite.
[00:52:41.683 --> 00:52:42.364]  We've got to do it.
[00:52:42.944 --> 00:52:44.545]  Don't say his name.
[00:52:44.545 --> 00:52:47.026]  We're watching you in live time.
[00:52:47.026 --> 00:52:51.029]  And we've got 20,000 minders at Facebook with AI watching you.
[00:52:51.029 --> 00:52:53.790]  That is beyond Black Mirror episode.
[00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:55.752]  That's beyond 1984.
[00:52:55.752 --> 00:52:56.692]  And they're doing it.
[00:52:56.692 --> 00:52:57.132]  Why not?
[00:52:57.132 --> 00:53:00.755]  You accepted Amazon's Alexa in your house.
[00:53:00.755 --> 00:53:04.337]  You accepted the surveillance cameras where they admit they're watching you.
[00:53:04.337 --> 00:53:08.339]  What's the name of the Facebook system where it watches you in live time?
[00:53:08.339 --> 00:53:11.361]  But it's got a little shutter you can close, but it's still got a microphone.
[00:53:14.673 --> 00:53:16.474]  And again, you're like, why doesn't it hide?
[00:53:16.474 --> 00:53:17.555]  It doesn't matter.
[00:53:17.555 --> 00:53:19.396]  They want your data.
[00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:21.858]  They manipulate the data against you.
[00:53:21.858 --> 00:53:24.159]  Here's an example that came out 10 years ago.
[00:53:24.159 --> 00:53:33.445]  If you have money and you buy first class or they know you're wealthy, when you go to these big travel sites and hotel sites, they charge you more.
[00:53:33.445 --> 00:53:35.387]  That's a cookie that knows you're wealthy.
[00:53:35.387 --> 00:53:36.127]  It rips you off.
[00:53:36.127 --> 00:53:38.429]  That's an example of what this is doing to you.
[00:53:42.068 --> 00:53:46.239]  So again, the big question, why isn't Trump doing anything?
[00:53:46.239 --> 00:53:48.225]  It's because he's surrounded by neocons and lobbyists.
[00:53:49.218 --> 00:53:54.259]  And he's speaking out against the censorship, but it's the architecture of the system that keeps saying it's a private company, sir.
[00:53:54.259 --> 00:53:58.320]  It's like a telecom or a highway saying certain groups can't drive down it.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.920]  They're openly discriminating against.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:01.741]  They're illegally spying.
[00:54:01.741 --> 00:54:02.801]  They're violating their own terms.
[00:54:02.801 --> 00:54:16.204]  I have a Supreme Court case I'll dig out here in the stack where they just ruled this year that they couldn't let child molesters not be on Facebook because it's a communication system and so it's ubiquitous in a monopoly, so they've got to let you on Facebook.
[00:54:18.288 --> 00:54:19.929]  Now they try to target kids, arrest them.
[00:54:19.929 --> 00:54:26.994]  But the point is, child molesters can be on Facebook, but Alex Jones can't, and you can't say what's happening to him is wrong.
[00:54:26.994 --> 00:54:37.902]  They say in their press release, I'm going to read in a moment, I can't believe I'm reading this, that is, if you say anything nice to your band, you must, you must, what's the exact term they use?
[00:54:39.125 --> 00:54:41.667]  InfoWars is subject to the strictest ban.
[00:54:41.667 --> 00:54:50.034]  Facebook and Instagram will remove any content containing InfoWars videos, radio segments, or articles unless the post is explicitly condemning the content.
[00:54:50.034 --> 00:54:53.617]  This is just their internal stuff they've been sending out for years.
[00:54:53.617 --> 00:55:01.843]  And Facebook will also remove any groups set up to share InfoWars content and events promoting any of the banned extremist figures, according to a company spokesperson.
[00:55:01.843 --> 00:55:04.686]  Twitter, YouTube, and Apple have also banned Jones.
[00:55:04.686 --> 00:55:05.827]  And then we've got their press release.
[00:55:05.827 --> 00:55:08.409]  They sent a local TV station we're on in Kansas.
[00:55:09.943 --> 00:55:11.024]  Papert got the full letter.
[00:55:11.024 --> 00:55:12.285]  In fact, that's in the other studio.
[00:55:12.285 --> 00:55:13.486]  Please bring it to me.
[00:55:13.486 --> 00:55:14.787]  The full letter.
[00:55:14.787 --> 00:55:36.403]  They're sending letters out to the media telling TV stations, if you have Alex Jones on your commercial TV station... I was on radio in DC this morning and they said we had to have a managerial meeting whether you could even come on and then they made the decision to take the risk even though Facebook told us we'll ban you on Facebook to a radio station.
[00:55:37.335 --> 00:55:39.317]  They sent press releases out!
[00:55:39.317 --> 00:55:47.304]  They said, you promote this guy, you have him on, we're gonna knock your teeth out!
[00:55:47.304 --> 00:55:48.585]  Gangsters, man.
[00:55:48.585 --> 00:55:53.249]  This is the land of the cowards and home of the slaves if we put up with this crap.
[00:55:53.249 --> 00:55:56.111]  What the hell have we turned into?
[00:55:56.111 --> 00:55:58.033]  What planet did we wake up in, huh?
[00:56:00.749 --> 00:56:03.951]  And I'm saying to these radio and TV stations, hey, give me that letter.
[00:56:03.951 --> 00:56:05.232]  We're not supposed to.
[00:56:05.232 --> 00:56:06.132]  We got the letter!
[00:56:06.132 --> 00:56:07.353]  I forgot it.
[00:56:07.353 --> 00:56:08.994]  Owen had it on yesterday.
[00:56:08.994 --> 00:56:12.156]  Because of a station manager, Tom Pappard.
[00:56:12.156 --> 00:56:13.437]  And banks get these letters too.
[00:56:13.437 --> 00:56:18.000]  They tell them, oh, you can't have Alex Jones with a bank account.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.201]  They're in your business, folks.
[00:56:20.201 --> 00:56:25.624]  They're telling TV and radio stations what they can do in America.
[00:56:25.624 --> 00:56:29.207]  And can you imagine once they get a fully cashless society, what they're going to do?
[00:56:30.748 --> 00:56:32.549]  Can you imagine this?
[00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:36.433]  And it's run by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:56:36.433 --> 00:56:39.135]  Laura Loomer's coming up.
[00:56:39.135 --> 00:56:41.156]  We got a bunch of other people.
[00:56:41.156 --> 00:56:43.198]  Robert Barnes is coming in studio.
[00:56:43.198 --> 00:56:44.259]  Paul Watson couldn't make it.
[00:56:44.259 --> 00:56:45.760]  He's got a family emergency.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.361]  He's been banned.
[00:56:47.361 --> 00:56:49.403]  All because he's branching out on his own.
[00:56:49.403 --> 00:56:51.164]  Doing his own thing.
[00:56:51.164 --> 00:56:51.805]  He's popular.
[00:56:51.805 --> 00:56:53.246]  He gets millions of viewers a day.
[00:56:53.246 --> 00:56:54.147]  He's a good guy.
[00:56:54.147 --> 00:56:55.528]  No, you don't get speech, Paul.
[00:56:56.758 --> 00:57:13.885]  So I'll tell you again, we have the highest rated, best gravity fed filters that have been tested by top labs to be one of the only ones in the country that cut out glyphosates and everything else and it's half the cost of leading competitors because they do a 300% markup and all we do is about a 60% markup and that's when it's not on sale.
[00:57:13.885 --> 00:57:18.887]  $50 off the Alexa Pure Pro, their biggest stainless steel model.
[00:57:18.887 --> 00:57:19.587]  Ladies and gentlemen,

[00:57:45.926 --> 00:57:47.868]  Hour number two straight ahead!

[00:58:50.692 --> 00:58:53.414]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[00:58:53.414 --> 00:58:59.757]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[00:58:59.757 --> 00:59:01.498]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[00:59:14.465 --> 00:59:14.865]  I think so.
[00:59:34.187 --> 00:59:36.649]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:01.281 --> 01:00:09.584]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.584 --> 01:00:14.305]  In times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:00:14.305 --> 01:00:18.526]  I gave you a little bit too much truth and now I must be silenced.
[01:00:18.526 --> 01:00:24.208]  Banned by Facebook, banned by Instagram, and now the media says Louis Farrakhan is far right.
[01:00:24.668 --> 01:00:25.288]  What?!
[01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:30.249]  They obviously banned Farrakhan at the same time to give them the excuse that this wasn't political.
[01:00:30.249 --> 01:00:31.909]  It was totally political.
[01:00:31.909 --> 01:00:34.830]  This is nothing less than election meddling.
[01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:39.611]  Everyone Facebook has banned was instrumental in getting Donald Trump elected.
[01:00:39.611 --> 01:00:40.771]  This is punishment.
[01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:42.452]  This is a political purge.
[01:00:42.452 --> 01:00:46.932]  This has nothing to do with hate or violating terms of service.
[01:00:46.932 --> 01:00:49.033]  Russians buy a few Facebook ads.
[01:00:49.033 --> 01:00:49.593]  Leftists.
[01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:50.694]  This is horrendous!
[01:00:50.694 --> 01:00:51.935]  This is election meddling!
[01:00:51.935 --> 01:00:53.856]  Democracy's at stake!
[01:00:53.856 --> 01:00:57.439]  Facebook bans most of the people who helped get Trump elected.
[01:00:57.439 --> 01:00:59.280]  Leftists and boomers.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.922]  Herd herm a private company can do what it likes.
[01:01:01.922 --> 01:01:03.984]  The creepiest thing is not the bans.
[01:01:03.984 --> 01:01:09.068]  It's the threat that anyone else will be banned for talking about the people who were banned.
[01:01:09.068 --> 01:01:09.928]  That's chilling.
[01:01:09.928 --> 01:01:15.913]  That's giant corporations enforcing their own communist Chinese style social credit system.
[01:01:15.913 --> 01:01:17.474]  And leftists love it.
[01:01:17.754 --> 01:01:22.395]  I was given no reason whatsoever for being banned by Facebook or Instagram.
[01:01:22.395 --> 01:01:23.876]  So I'm dangerous.
[01:01:23.876 --> 01:01:27.676]  Someone who makes meme videos laughing at social justice warriors.
[01:01:27.676 --> 01:01:35.098]  Or is handing the power to decide who gets to have free speech to a handful of giant politically partisan corporations dangerous.
[01:01:35.098 --> 01:01:36.619]  What's more dangerous?
[01:01:36.619 --> 01:01:41.620]  They put me on a list with terrorists, human traffickers and serial killers.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.581]  Because I criticise modern art and modern architecture.
[01:01:44.581 --> 01:01:46.841]  Because I dare criticise mass immigration.
[01:01:46.841 --> 01:01:49.682]  Because I dare criticise a belief system.
[01:01:49.682 --> 01:01:54.244]  Yet you still host Antifa accounts which threaten to assassinate the President.
[01:01:54.244 --> 01:01:59.405]  You still host accounts belonging to the sicko who sent death threats to Ben Shapiro's family.
[01:01:59.585 --> 01:02:02.869]  This is truly, truly clown world.
[01:02:02.869 --> 01:02:07.013]  And notice how the media were tipped off over an hour in advance of me getting banned.
[01:02:07.013 --> 01:02:13.821]  The same media that's been lobbying for conservatives to be silenced, censored and deplatformed for the past two years.
[01:02:13.821 --> 01:02:16.424]  There are barely any real journalists left.
[01:02:16.604 --> 01:02:23.428]  They're all activists, abusing their power, working hand-in-hand with big tech to eliminate their competition.
[01:02:23.428 --> 01:02:28.251]  When are we going to see any kind of sensible regulations or laws to stop this?
[01:02:28.251 --> 01:02:34.234]  They're now removing people's ability to have bank accounts and credit cards because they have the wrong opinions.
[01:02:34.234 --> 01:02:38.016]  They're literally trying to remove your right to buy and sell.
[01:02:38.016 --> 01:02:39.537]  This is biblical.
[01:02:39.537 --> 01:02:42.979]  No right to commerce unless you have the mark.
[01:02:42.979 --> 01:02:44.040]  And what is the mark?
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.141]  Total intellectual castration and obedience.
[01:02:48.141 --> 01:02:50.022]  So this looks like it's the end.
[01:02:50.022 --> 01:02:52.562]  I'll still be at summit.news while that exists.
[01:02:52.562 --> 01:02:57.724]  While I exist as my entire purpose for existing is snuffed out.
[01:02:57.724 --> 01:03:05.847]  While society is handed over to deranged infantilized crybabies who think hate speech is challenging their stupid opinions.
[01:03:05.847 --> 01:03:13.549]  Hysterical authoritarian clowns have seized control of the new public square and conservatives did nothing to stop
[01:03:13.869 --> 01:03:16.870]  The Trump administration did nothing to stop it.
[01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:18.571]  You thought it would stop at Alex Jones?
[01:03:18.571 --> 01:03:20.091]  You think it's gonna stop at me?
[01:03:20.091 --> 01:03:22.952]  You think it's gonna stop at Facebook accounts?
[01:03:22.952 --> 01:03:26.134]  They even demanded YouTube remove Ben Shapiro!
[01:03:26.134 --> 01:03:31.175]  They want your bank accounts, they want your home, they want you disappeared.
[01:03:31.175 --> 01:03:37.698]  If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led like sheep to the slaughter.
[01:03:43.661 --> 01:03:45.103]  Alright, folks.
[01:03:45.103 --> 01:03:48.007]  I've blown off some steam in the first hour.
[01:03:48.007 --> 01:03:54.875]  Constitutional lawyer, very successful litigator, civil rights lawyer, Robert Barnes just happens to be in town while all this is happening.
[01:03:54.875 --> 01:03:58.119]  He predicted a month ago on air they were about to set me up for anti-Semitism.
[01:03:58.119 --> 01:03:58.880]  It happened.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.223]  We issued a legal warning to these groups.
[01:04:01.223 --> 01:04:02.265]  They just went ahead with a lie.
[01:04:03.391 --> 01:04:04.832]  But remember, this isn't about me.
[01:04:04.832 --> 01:04:07.112]  I'm not here talking about how I'm being censored.
[01:04:07.112 --> 01:04:09.573]  They're coming after everybody right now.
[01:04:09.573 --> 01:04:13.695]  This is a major rollout, and they've told us the next architecture.
[01:04:13.695 --> 01:04:15.015]  The president tweeted about this.
[01:04:15.015 --> 01:04:25.679]  They're going to control the links you can send out, and in live time, they've got watchers through these apps on your phone watching what you're doing in text messages and phone calls.
[01:04:25.679 --> 01:04:31.761]  When we come back, CNN's Oliver Darcy says that's next, and they're trying to stop me from sending text messages now.
[01:04:32.381 --> 01:04:32.882]  Exactly.
[01:04:32.882 --> 01:04:34.724]  I mean, you see it with WhatsApp.
[01:04:34.724 --> 01:04:38.369]  It's just broad-scale, wholesale censorship, suppression of speech.
[01:04:38.369 --> 01:04:44.919]  It's an attempt to, you know, say, hey, everybody create a group living room on your Facebook page, and once you do, we're going to decide what you can talk about.
[01:04:44.919 --> 01:04:46.821]  Yeah, once you do, we're going to tie you up and rape you.
[01:04:46.821 --> 01:04:48.143]  Oh, I mean, effectively.
[01:04:48.143 --> 01:04:49.004]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:49.004 --> 01:04:49.345]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.284 --> 01:05:00.685]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:05:00.685 --> 01:05:02.586]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:05:02.586 --> 01:05:03.206]  It is.
[01:05:03.206 --> 01:05:08.068]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:05:08.068 --> 01:05:09.429]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:05:09.429 --> 01:05:11.250]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:13.731]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:05:13.731 --> 01:05:15.352]  Brain, body, heart.
[01:05:15.352 --> 01:05:16.812]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[01:05:16.812 --> 01:05:18.193]  You've got the children's.
[01:05:18.193 --> 01:05:19.314]  You've got the adults.
[01:05:19.314 --> 01:05:20.314]  You've got the krill oil.
[01:05:20.314 --> 01:05:23.696]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[01:05:23.696 --> 01:05:26.057]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[01:05:26.277 --> 01:05:27.618]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:05:27.618 --> 01:05:28.378]  And I'm sorry.
[01:05:28.378 --> 01:05:29.479]  You want something like this?
[01:05:29.479 --> 01:05:30.440]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:32.381]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:05:32.381 --> 01:05:33.082]  It's so good.
[01:05:33.082 --> 01:05:33.582]  In my view.
[01:05:33.582 --> 01:05:35.623]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:05:35.623 --> 01:05:42.008]  When I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:05:42.008 --> 01:05:46.571]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:05:49.517 --> 01:05:55.422]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:05:55.422 --> 01:05:59.825]  I just can't do it!
[01:05:59.825 --> 01:06:06.070]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:26.906]  There are thousands of channels out there, millions of people on the internet talking, but folks, this is the most banned, most demonized, most lied about broadcast in the world.
[01:06:26.906 --> 01:06:33.071]  Facebook, when they banned Farrakhan to try to cover up they were banning conservatives, they just threw him in.
[01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:46.702]  Said, I'm the most banned person, and a new special class of hate leader, and that you're not allowed to say my name or my website, InfoWars.com, I'm gonna read the press release, unless, this is being sent out to TV stations.
[01:06:48.122 --> 01:06:50.083]  Our stations are getting these.
[01:06:50.083 --> 01:06:51.664]  They're sending them out to everybody.
[01:06:51.664 --> 01:06:55.625]  Telling them, you don't have them on you.
[01:06:55.625 --> 01:06:57.666]  We'll take this away from you.
[01:06:57.666 --> 01:06:59.187]  This is racketeering.
[01:06:59.187 --> 01:07:02.888]  This is tortious interference.
[01:07:02.888 --> 01:07:08.091]  Trump has green-lighted them doing this by his lack of resisting, and so has Congress.
[01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:11.412]  And so now we see the dam breaking.
[01:07:11.412 --> 01:07:13.693]  And we're going to play a clip in a moment I've been mentioning for an hour.
[01:07:13.693 --> 01:07:15.754]  And Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, is here with us.
[01:07:17.079 --> 01:07:23.687]  Where this app, WhatsApp, that's been bought up by Facebook, they're buying thousands of companies a year.
[01:07:23.687 --> 01:07:25.029]  Thousands.
[01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:27.071]  Hundreds of big ones.
[01:07:27.071 --> 01:07:30.596]  It's some popular thing for text messages and phone calls, just to individuals.
[01:07:30.596 --> 01:07:31.316]  Kind of like Signal.
[01:07:32.176 --> 01:07:34.759]  I mean, I still use regular phones, even though they don't seem to work good.
[01:07:34.759 --> 01:07:37.483]  I don't know why these apps work so well, because they're digital.
[01:07:37.483 --> 01:07:39.666]  Because the phone company can't do that.
[01:07:39.666 --> 01:07:41.889]  But it's NSA-level technology.
[01:07:41.889 --> 01:07:45.213]  Now they're saying, we're going to watch what you're doing and who you're calling.
[01:07:45.213 --> 01:07:48.637]  And then MasterCard said, we're not just going to ban extremist bank accounts.
[01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:54.573]  We're having shopping carts, or people that criticize radical Islam, or open borders.
[01:07:54.573 --> 01:08:02.057]  We're going to watch who you visit and who you're supporting, and if you buy something from someone we don't like, you're banned.
[01:08:02.057 --> 01:08:03.598]  That's in the newscast!
[01:08:03.598 --> 01:08:05.699]  That's mainstream news!
[01:08:05.699 --> 01:08:11.142]  I mean, this is Mark of the Beast on PCP, steroids, and nitrous oxide.
[01:08:12.273 --> 01:08:16.738]  I mean, this is leaping faster than I thought.
[01:08:16.738 --> 01:08:21.362]  And people always said Facebook's the most evil, and I'm like, well, really, I kind of think Google is.
[01:08:21.362 --> 01:08:24.906]  No, no, they've proven this is the next level.
[01:08:24.906 --> 01:08:26.607]  And it's just insane.
[01:08:26.607 --> 01:08:29.550]  We're going to play these clips, but, I mean, I don't know what the bigger deal is.
[01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:31.150]  You were here a month ago.
[01:08:31.150 --> 01:08:36.372]  The admission that I didn't do anything anti-Semitic, even if I did, I should have free speech.
[01:08:36.372 --> 01:08:44.275]  They found me not guilty of it, but a month later still go with the story and ban me, coordinated with Business Insider and a bunch of others who all publish at the same time.
[01:08:44.275 --> 01:08:50.136]  Or, them saying, yeah, we're going to be in your text messages and listening to your phone calls now with AI.
[01:08:50.136 --> 01:08:52.337]  Really the big announcement is the AI's gone live.
[01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:54.378]  They had a congressional hearing last year where
[01:08:55.379 --> 01:08:58.524]  The Islamic guy had run over people in New York screaming Allah Akbar with a truck.
[01:08:58.524 --> 01:09:03.151]  Paul wrote that an imam had warned the week before that the guy was at the mosque saying he'd do this.
[01:09:03.151 --> 01:09:04.172]  That was the top story on Twitter.
[01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:06.824]  And they complained at lunch.
[01:09:06.824 --> 01:09:14.946]  Congressman Quigley said to the technical head of Twitter, he said, in the hearing, he played it 50 times probably, he said, I saw Paul Watson Infowars was number one at lunch.
[01:09:14.946 --> 01:09:16.967]  He goes, sir, we banned it.
[01:09:16.967 --> 01:09:19.728]  And soon we'll have AI in control in a few months.
[01:09:19.728 --> 01:09:20.689]  It's here.
[01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:22.029]  And they've announced it's here.
[01:09:22.029 --> 01:09:27.651]  But see, AI can't control memes or satire or comedy.
[01:09:27.651 --> 01:09:30.432]  So everyone's saying, oh, we deplore Alex Jones.
[01:09:30.432 --> 01:09:31.152]  He's horrible.
[01:09:31.152 --> 01:09:32.893]  You can only say his name if you say he's a horrible person.
[01:09:33.993 --> 01:09:37.237]  So now everybody's saying he's a real piece of filth, we hate him.
[01:09:37.237 --> 01:09:39.901]  Look what this evil man said, and it's a link.
[01:09:39.901 --> 01:09:41.363]  Well, that's why they've got the 20,000 censors.
[01:09:43.874 --> 01:09:50.658]  Part of this Human Rights Board, that's what they call it, MasterCard's doing it now too, they're in your bank account right now.
[01:09:50.658 --> 01:09:56.362]  It was me last year with Oliver Darcy in my bank account, you know, in my YouTube account.
[01:09:56.362 --> 01:09:57.082]  Now, why not?
[01:09:57.082 --> 01:09:57.743]  Hell, it worked.
[01:09:57.743 --> 01:09:59.284]  Why not your account?
[01:09:59.284 --> 01:10:01.005]  And a lot of people say, well, I better bend over.
[01:10:01.005 --> 01:10:04.627]  Folks, you bend over to these people, the slippery slope is immediate.
[01:10:06.277 --> 01:10:08.439]  Robert Barnes, I can't believe it's gotten this crazy.
[01:10:08.439 --> 01:10:10.820]  You're a constitutional lawyer, you have a way of crystallizing it.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:11.661]  What's the biggest story?
[01:10:11.661 --> 01:10:12.141]  The A.I.'
[01:10:12.121 --> 01:10:19.607]  's turned on, they're watching everything you do, now they're telling people, with me as a test case, don't share his name, it'll be something new next week?
[01:10:19.607 --> 01:10:22.649]  Or them admitting it's all political, or that Trump's not doing anything?
[01:10:23.129 --> 01:10:34.427]  I think the biggest thing is that they've now jumped the shark in terms of, they're no longer saying, here's who can be on the social media, here's who can use social media, here's who can use PayPal, here's who can use payment processors.
[01:10:34.427 --> 01:10:38.173]  They're now saying, here's who you, the ordinary person out there, can talk about.
[01:10:38.513 --> 01:10:43.915]  Here's whose names you can reference, here's what links you can share, but it goes beyond that.
[01:10:43.915 --> 01:10:46.136]  You literally cannot say the name Alex Jones now.
[01:10:46.136 --> 01:10:51.139]  You cannot say the name Infowars or you're subject to censorship, subject to suppression, subject to being banned.
[01:10:51.139 --> 01:10:58.242]  And this happens literally two days after Zuckerberg says, hey, I want everybody to use Facebook to become your everyday living room.
[01:10:58.602 --> 01:10:59.043]  Alex Jones is filth!
[01:10:59.043 --> 01:10:59.143]  Good!
[01:10:59.143 --> 01:10:59.643]  I like Alex Jones!
[01:10:59.643 --> 01:11:00.604]  Take her to the gulag!
[01:11:22.302 --> 01:11:22.663]  Exactly.
[01:11:22.663 --> 01:11:30.591]  And clearly, for example, here he was at the same time saying he's going to promote privacy again after he's been caught violating privacy rules repeatedly again and again and again.
[01:11:30.591 --> 01:11:31.532]  He surveils everyone.
[01:11:31.532 --> 01:11:31.932]  Exactly.
[01:11:31.932 --> 01:11:33.534]  Now it's obvious that's what he's doing here.
[01:11:33.534 --> 01:11:37.918]  How does he know whether someone is talking about InfoWars or Alex Jones in these private chat rooms?
[01:11:38.599 --> 01:11:39.920]  Unless he's monitoring him.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.120]  Oh, they say!
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.341]  They say right here in the press release!
[01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:46.983]  You can only talk about him if you explicitly condemn him.
[01:11:46.983 --> 01:11:47.863]  Exactly.
[01:11:47.863 --> 01:11:48.843]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:11:48.843 --> 01:11:51.264]  That's like a Twilight Zone episode!
[01:11:51.264 --> 01:12:00.648]  Even past that, there's not a Twilight Zone episode, an Orwellian book, an actual historical example of this really ever happening, other than the closest you would get is the Man in the Iron Mask story.
[01:12:00.648 --> 01:12:03.629]  That's the most analogous through any part of fictional history.
[01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:07.111]  For folks that don't know that, it's classical literature that's gone the way of the Goonie Bird.
[01:12:07.111 --> 01:12:07.551]  Tell them about it.
[01:12:07.691 --> 01:12:08.131]  Sure.
[01:12:08.131 --> 01:12:19.595]  So what happened was there was someone who was the actual king, and they were locked up in a prison, and they were put in an iron mask so that even other people in the jail, jailers, other people who visited the jail, wouldn't know who he was.
[01:12:19.595 --> 01:12:22.376]  That the real king had been locked up.
[01:12:22.376 --> 01:12:27.298]  Because if they recognized him and saw him, they would realize that there was a fake king, a pretender king, who had the crown.
[01:12:27.298 --> 01:12:27.718]  Precisely.
[01:12:27.978 --> 01:12:29.600]  And so that's the same dynamic here.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.982]  So here, I mean, that's the closest example.
[01:12:31.982 --> 01:12:33.783]  Otherwise, we've never had anything like this.
[01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:35.345]  Even Orwell didn't predict this.
[01:12:35.345 --> 01:12:39.048]  I mean, of all the people who fore... even Scott Adams didn't forecast this.
[01:12:39.048 --> 01:12:47.195]  So some of the best predictors in the world, some of the most aggressive science fiction writers, some of the most... the most... Aldous Huxley didn't predict this.
[01:12:47.555 --> 01:12:57.046]  Nobody even got to the point where they said, you know in the future there's going to be a point and place in time where in your own living room, the Facebook living room, you can't mention someone's name.
[01:12:57.046 --> 01:13:00.369]  And they're surveilling you and you take little robots into your house.
[01:13:00.369 --> 01:13:01.310]  What's the name of Facebook?
[01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:05.515]  I know there's Google Assist, there's Alexa with Amazon.
[01:13:05.515 --> 01:13:05.915]  What's the name?
[01:13:06.906 --> 01:13:07.826]  We're good to go.
[01:13:25.711 --> 01:13:26.371]  Well, absolutely.
[01:13:26.371 --> 01:13:27.612]  That's where it's going.
[01:13:27.612 --> 01:13:28.673]  It's already there digitally.
[01:13:28.673 --> 01:13:36.078]  They're saying in your own digital personal private space that you carve off for your personal private space, that they ask you to carve off as your personal private space.
[01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.339]  They're going to monitor it, surveil it.
[01:13:37.339 --> 01:13:39.100]  He says, let us into your living room.
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:39.720]  Absolutely.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:42.322]  And let us be your living room.
[01:13:42.322 --> 01:13:46.104]  Let us create a digital living room that substitutes for your real living room.
[01:13:46.104 --> 01:13:51.588]  But just in case you don't do that, we're going to put a little device in there to monitor what you are saying.
[01:13:51.588 --> 01:13:52.969]  We're living in science fiction.
[01:13:52.969 --> 01:13:54.150]  And this is the dystopia.
[01:13:55.003 --> 01:13:57.784]  And it's a dystopia beyond even the wildest imagination.
[01:13:57.784 --> 01:13:58.824]  How did they choose us, though?
[01:13:58.824 --> 01:14:00.545]  Because, obviously, I was the target a month ago.
[01:14:00.545 --> 01:14:03.165]  We got the secret documents that are now public.
[01:14:03.165 --> 01:14:04.586]  And then they just threw Farrakhan in.
[01:14:04.586 --> 01:14:05.686]  But, I mean, this is crazy.
[01:14:05.686 --> 01:14:06.946]  It's the highest level of success.
[01:14:06.946 --> 01:14:12.668]  So they were trying to go at you and trying to attack you by trying to find some term of service that you had violated.
[01:14:12.668 --> 01:14:13.028]  They couldn't.
[01:14:13.568 --> 01:14:14.729]  Every time they tried, they couldn't.
[01:14:14.729 --> 01:14:22.875]  I mean, even years ago, the Anti-Defamation League, which is not exactly a politically neutral organization, looked at all the allegations of anti-Semitism against you and said they're false.
[01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:25.397]  They said, in fact, that Alex Jones is not anti-Semitic at all.
[01:14:25.397 --> 01:14:26.498]  And that's ADL.
[01:14:26.498 --> 01:14:33.063]  That's a far-left organization that doesn't have any problem over-accusing people of being anti-Semitic.
[01:14:33.323 --> 01:14:34.384]  So they couldn't go there.
[01:14:34.384 --> 01:14:35.185]  They looked at the post.
[01:14:35.185 --> 01:14:39.949]  They realized the post didn't violate any rules because their own people looking at it said this didn't violate any rules.
[01:14:39.949 --> 01:14:45.694]  So they're in a place where they're like, okay, we've just got to create our own Orwellian world and we got to go further than Orwell even imagined going.
[01:14:45.694 --> 01:14:52.681]  And we got to just ban not only him, but ban anyone ever talking about him, referring to him, referencing him, sharing his content, or just saying his name.
[01:14:52.681 --> 01:14:57.505]  You know, literally create the Voldemort Harry Potter fiction and make it a literal legal political
[01:14:57.645 --> 01:14:59.326]  And that's what Wired Magazine said three months ago.
[01:14:59.326 --> 01:15:01.688]  They said, no one should be able to say his name.
[01:15:01.688 --> 01:15:04.110]  Maybe we should put that up on screen.
[01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:05.450]  And people thought it was a joke.
[01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:06.191]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:08.412]  I mean, when I first heard about it, I thought, that's just too insane.
[01:15:08.412 --> 01:15:09.934]  That's too insane, even for big tech.
[01:15:09.934 --> 01:15:13.076]  They're not going to do something that tells everybody it's something that's so obvious.
[01:15:13.076 --> 01:15:18.720]  Because if I was somebody, and I didn't even know Alex Jones or InfoWars, I would immediately be curious if I was somebody.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.121]  Well, yeah, what is it about InfoWars?
[01:15:20.121 --> 01:15:21.682]  Is it guests like you?
[01:15:22.442 --> 01:15:23.983]  I think it's a combination.
[01:15:23.983 --> 01:15:28.606]  It's the success rate at getting attention of independent ideas outside... Well, they know we kick their ass.
[01:15:28.606 --> 01:15:29.067]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:29.067 --> 01:15:32.489]  We just keep firing proton torpedoes down the reactor shaft.
[01:15:32.489 --> 01:15:34.030]  We blow up like 15 Death Stars.
[01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.370]  Precisely.
[01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:36.732]  And they're seeing it translate to people's everyday activity.
[01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:40.934]  They're seeing it translate to political success from US to Brazil to Hungary.
[01:15:40.934 --> 01:15:43.696]  It's changing the world because of what ordinary everyday people are doing.
[01:15:43.696 --> 01:15:44.317]  Precisely.
[01:15:45.397 --> 01:15:47.919]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide.
[01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:54.964]  I gotta say, I feel good to have scum like this attacking us because I believe in you and I believe you're going to defeat them with HUMET.
[01:15:54.964 --> 01:15:55.505]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:57.448 --> 01:15:58.288]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.288 --> 01:15:59.989]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:03.730]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:04.811]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.811 --> 01:16:06.631]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.631 --> 01:16:08.352]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:26.997 --> 01:16:33.339]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:36.379]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.379 --> 01:16:42.301]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.301 --> 01:16:46.082]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.082 --> 01:16:47.362]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.362 --> 01:16:48.702]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.702 --> 01:16:54.904]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:54.904 --> 01:16:56.324]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.242 --> 01:16:59.204]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:59.204 --> 01:17:04.527]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:04.527 --> 01:17:06.109]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.109 --> 01:17:14.455]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:17:22.141 --> 01:17:24.424]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:24.424 --> 01:17:28.810]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:31.012]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:20:01.262 --> 01:20:03.904]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.796 --> 01:20:16.980]  On corruption.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:20.587]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:20:20.587 --> 01:20:22.691]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:22.691 --> 01:20:25.376]  That's what we do, we crash through folks.
[01:20:27.707 --> 01:20:29.829]  People are calling me like, how are you handling this?
[01:20:29.829 --> 01:20:32.691]  And I'm like, I'm worried about the country and the world, but me particularly.
[01:20:32.691 --> 01:20:34.733]  It's like I'm in a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:20:34.733 --> 01:20:38.297]  Robert Barnes, you just won a huge case in Milwaukee.
[01:20:38.297 --> 01:20:42.681]  Highly respected tax lawyer.
[01:20:42.681 --> 01:20:44.322]  Highly respected civil rights lawyer.
[01:20:45.283 --> 01:20:47.025]  I mean, you're up there as a super lawyer.
[01:20:47.025 --> 01:20:48.487]  Nobody denies it.
[01:20:48.487 --> 01:20:52.591]  And of course then, they're trying to keep you out of the case in Connecticut.
[01:20:52.591 --> 01:20:55.174]  They're trying to keep you out of the case in Austin.
[01:20:55.174 --> 01:20:58.857]  And all because you said these suits are politically motivated.
[01:20:58.857 --> 01:21:00.019]  They tried to have a hearing yesterday.
[01:21:00.019 --> 01:21:00.940]  The judge pushed it off.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:01.660]  I don't
[01:21:19.057 --> 01:21:20.417]  They're just out of control.
[01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:20.978]  Oh, completely.
[01:21:20.978 --> 01:21:23.258]  I mean, it's one thing to try to suppress your speech.
[01:21:23.258 --> 01:21:27.199]  It's another thing to try to suppress the speech of ordinary people across the country.
[01:21:27.199 --> 01:21:32.601]  But it's really extraordinary to try to suppress the speech of the lawyer advocating on a client's behalf.
[01:21:32.601 --> 01:21:37.522]  While the other side lawyers run around like chickens with their heads cut off all over television slandering me.
[01:21:37.822 --> 01:21:41.967]  Well, I mean, the case started out with the lawyer being on NBC and reaching tens of millions of people.
[01:21:41.967 --> 01:21:42.628]  Megyn Kelly.
[01:21:42.628 --> 01:21:43.489]  Exactly.
[01:21:43.489 --> 01:21:46.792]  Leaking all kinds of stories, leaking the deposition, creating a YouTube page.
[01:21:46.792 --> 01:21:51.678]  And then all we do is raise the shield in defense on our own show, and it's like, don't you raise the shield?! !
[01:21:53.015 --> 01:21:53.636]  Correct, exactly.
[01:21:53.636 --> 01:21:58.280]  And not only that, it's clear that people are politically misusing and abusing this suit.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.603]  Senator Murphy's comments have no business in this country, period.
[01:22:01.603 --> 01:22:10.512]  To say he wants to have someone banned from being able to speak ever, anywhere, anyplace, anytime, which is what he did, based on his misusing and abusing that lawsuit to do so.
[01:22:10.512 --> 01:22:18.079]  So, the I'm entitled to my First Amendment rights, I'm going to continue to express my First Amendment rights, they're not going to stop me from doing that, they're going to have to put me six feet under before that happens.
[01:22:18.499 --> 01:22:23.526]  So it's a waste of time for the most part, but it shows the degree of insanity that is taking place here.
[01:22:23.526 --> 01:22:31.137]  They don't want anyone to be able to talk about you, reference you, defend you, even a lawyer whose constitutional duty and obligation is to do precisely that.
[01:22:31.137 --> 01:22:32.138]  And it shows the scope of it.
[01:22:32.138 --> 01:22:33.199]  And it's ironic.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:40.346]  That all of this is happening, like when you look at what Zuckerberg said just two days before he decided, by the way, nobody can talk about Alex Jones.
[01:22:40.346 --> 01:22:41.987]  He said the future is private.
[01:22:41.987 --> 01:22:50.115]  And don't worry, we're going to create digital families, digital private spaces, digital living rooms for you to talk about, and private chat rooms, whatever you want to talk about.
[01:22:50.515 --> 01:23:01.709]  And then two days later says, by the way, we're actually monitoring this on a real-time basis with algorithms and artificial intelligence, and we're going to actually suppress and censor anything you say in your actual room.
[01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:04.352]  I mean, even the Soviets didn't do this, right?
[01:23:04.352 --> 01:23:05.754]  Oh, let's just be honest.
[01:23:05.934 --> 01:23:06.874]  Oh, completely.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.562]  Try to delete her Facebook.
[01:23:31.562 --> 01:23:32.182]  Try to get rid of it.
[01:23:32.182 --> 01:23:33.143]  It won't go away.
[01:23:33.143 --> 01:23:34.485]  And then it sends her messages.
[01:23:34.485 --> 01:23:36.407]  Oh, here's a memory of you five years ago.
[01:23:36.407 --> 01:23:38.008]  Yes, exactly.
[01:23:38.008 --> 01:23:39.990]  There's my old ex-boyfriend seven years ago.
[01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.571]  Well, not only that.
[01:23:40.571 --> 01:23:43.614]  Here I am in a swimsuit in Cancun nine years ago.
[01:23:43.614 --> 01:23:45.316]  Here I am with my mom ten years ago.
[01:23:45.316 --> 01:23:47.118]  And it's just like it's stolen her identity!
[01:23:47.338 --> 01:23:47.798]  Precisely.
[01:23:47.798 --> 01:23:49.079]  And it won't go away?
[01:23:49.079 --> 01:23:49.559]  Exactly.
[01:23:49.559 --> 01:24:02.024]  It's one of the reasons why they have such strong opposition to things like alternative methods of currency, things like blockchain, because those could allow ordinary individuals to reassert ownership over their own identity, because they would own those little pieces of themselves in social media.
[01:24:02.024 --> 01:24:02.444]  No, I agree.
[01:24:02.444 --> 01:24:06.646]  I never got into blockchain and all that because I knew it would be a pump and dump, but I believe the technology itself now...
[01:24:07.766 --> 01:24:09.487]  You should advise me the cleanest, best systems.
[01:24:09.487 --> 01:24:10.528]  We should get into this immediately.
[01:24:10.528 --> 01:24:15.631]  Absolutely, because I think there's a wide range of systems out there that are useful that people need to fully pursue.
[01:24:15.631 --> 01:24:31.842]  What they're doing is forcing people to use alternative systems, alternative mechanisms, alternative ways of communicating, because the mechanisms that they have monopolistic control over, they're going to use to... And of course they would abuse it, but imagine Ma Bell had like 90% of telephones in 1973, or whatever, they broke up a few years later.
[01:24:32.062 --> 01:24:40.807]  Exactly, or remove your ability to use your phone to talk to anybody because you talked about an impermissible topic, or you referenced an impermissible person, or you referenced an impermissible news site.
[01:24:50.933 --> 01:24:52.054]  And of course, you know what's going to happen.
[01:24:52.054 --> 01:24:54.857]  They get weak-minded, mentally ill people to be the SJWs.
[01:24:54.857 --> 01:24:55.598]  They interface with us.
[01:24:55.598 --> 01:24:59.342]  There's 70,000 of them admittedly trained by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:24:59.342 --> 01:25:00.203]  They have a background.
[01:25:00.203 --> 01:25:00.844]  They're a leftist.
[01:25:00.844 --> 01:25:01.765]  They're a failed professor.
[01:25:01.765 --> 01:25:02.546]  They're not getting a job.
[01:25:02.546 --> 01:25:03.887]  They're a failed media person.
[01:25:03.887 --> 01:25:04.788]  They give them an interface.
[01:25:04.788 --> 01:25:06.070]  They give them directives.
[01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:07.811]  They go out and help the AI censors.
[01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:08.052]  70,000 total.
[01:25:08.052 --> 01:25:08.352]  20,000 at Facebook.
[01:25:11.195 --> 01:25:16.238]  They're ramping it up, and then these people are giving access to your accounts, your photos.
[01:25:16.238 --> 01:25:18.679]  They're in your life, writing reports on you.
[01:25:18.679 --> 01:25:20.400]  They're watching you jerk off, man.
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:22.041]  They're watching you have sex with your wife.
[01:25:22.041 --> 01:25:23.502]  They're dialed into the Alexa.
[01:25:23.502 --> 01:25:25.503]  They're dialed into the portal.
[01:25:25.503 --> 01:25:29.566]  This is admitted, and you understand the cultural jump this is.
[01:25:30.206 --> 01:25:45.782]  Of AI learning using human traders as its collaborators, big tech traders with AI, with a bunch of collaborators, literally watching you cook that ham, watching you take a dump while you're on your phone, looking at photos of your kids, indexing and all.
[01:25:45.782 --> 01:25:50.127]  This is like an alien invasion, but it's big tech and a bunch of Silicon Valley psychopaths.
[01:25:50.427 --> 01:25:51.167]  Precisely.
[01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:56.209]  And for it to be so blatant and to be so bold, I think, is what shocked people yesterday.
[01:25:56.209 --> 01:26:00.330]  To go out there and say, hey, by the way, we're banning these people simply because we think they're dangerous.
[01:26:00.330 --> 01:26:13.573]  Not because they violated any terms of service, not because they violated any contractual terms, not because they did anything wrong at all, but simply because we think their ideas and their speech is scary for people to hear and listen to because it changes our ways.
[01:26:13.573 --> 01:26:13.853]  Oh my God.
[01:26:13.853 --> 01:26:15.614]  Think of the elitism of that.
[01:26:16.556 --> 01:26:23.243]  To say, oh, come to your digital bedroom or living room, you have all your speech, and then they totally do a 180.
[01:26:23.243 --> 01:26:25.525]  And then they go, but we know best.
[01:26:25.525 --> 01:26:29.348]  We're all the college professors that are in your life now.
[01:26:29.348 --> 01:26:30.450]  We're watching you.
[01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:35.655]  And NewsGuard announced six months ago, they're going to be at browser level in your phone.
[01:26:35.655 --> 01:26:40.279]  If you have a Microsoft phone, this is so criminal.
[01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:40.820]  This is like.
[01:26:41.744 --> 01:26:43.525]  But it's like, too criminal to fail.
[01:26:43.525 --> 01:26:51.307]  It's so big, so organized, so insane, and our instinct, like goonie birds, as Americans is, this can't happen, but it did happen.
[01:26:51.307 --> 01:26:52.227]  It is happening.
[01:26:52.227 --> 01:26:52.627]  Precisely.
[01:26:52.627 --> 01:26:59.029]  It's stuff that even the people who had the most fantastical, fictional view of what could happen, thought could not happen.
[01:26:59.029 --> 01:27:03.650]  They're like, okay, I mean, nobody was saying, okay, what's going to happen a year ago, two years ago, five years ago, 20, 50 years ago.
[01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:12.137]  Nobody was saying you're going to have a time and place where there's certain people's names who you cannot talk about, certain networks who you cannot reference by name.
[01:27:12.137 --> 01:27:18.403]  I mean, not just you can't reference their content, can't link them, can't talk about them, can't mention them, or you'll be said...
[01:27:20.325 --> 01:27:24.568]  I never thought stuff was a simulation, but this is getting, like, this is not real.
[01:27:24.568 --> 01:27:26.049]  It's a very bad simulation.
[01:27:26.049 --> 01:27:28.190]  And everybody knows I'm, like, pro-Israel.
[01:27:28.190 --> 01:27:29.411]  I'm vehemently pro-Israel.
[01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:30.212]  Israel's got its own problems.
[01:27:30.212 --> 01:27:31.313]  Like, I'm pro-America.
[01:27:31.313 --> 01:27:36.056]  America's not perfect, but, you know, it's better than, it's like, you know, Israel's better than the countries around it.
[01:27:36.056 --> 01:27:38.477]  But I'm not against it because they're Jewish.
[01:27:38.477 --> 01:27:43.241]  To say I'm an anti-Semite in thousands of articles, it's just, it shows they have no bottom.
[01:27:43.241 --> 01:27:45.022]  The system will do anything.
[01:27:45.362 --> 01:27:48.544]  And basically they're testing out what they can get away with.
[01:27:48.544 --> 01:27:56.469]  If they can completely remove any positive content, any positive reference by any ordinary person, any member of the media, any member of the press... They're getting rid of their competition.
[01:27:56.469 --> 01:27:57.510]  Absolutely they are.
[01:27:57.510 --> 01:28:00.532]  They can also defame and libel them without consequence.
[01:28:00.532 --> 01:28:01.953]  Because there's nobody to answer.
[01:28:01.953 --> 01:28:02.673]  And people don't get that.
[01:28:02.673 --> 01:28:04.574]  They go, so what, let them censor you.
[01:28:04.574 --> 01:28:05.235]  No!
[01:28:05.235 --> 01:28:08.056]  That's where 90% of the communication is going on.
[01:28:08.056 --> 01:28:11.899]  And then they can say whatever they want, but I can't even have my name unless it's negative?
[01:28:12.299 --> 01:28:12.779]  Oh, exactly.
[01:28:12.779 --> 01:28:14.520]  I think somebody put it well yesterday.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:21.204]  They're like, OK, if the explanation is, hey, don't worry, you can just go and create your own system, your own social media.
[01:28:21.204 --> 01:28:27.327]  Well, now you have to create your own social media, your own banking system, your own government effectively, your own economic system, your own phone system.
[01:28:27.327 --> 01:28:29.008]  And they're fighting to take all that away from us.
[01:28:29.008 --> 01:28:29.529]  Precisely.
[01:28:29.529 --> 01:28:32.070]  And they already have de facto monopolies in that market space.
[01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:34.031]  That's not a practical opportunity.
[01:28:34.031 --> 01:28:41.993]  Only the power of ordinary people exercising the rights of individual conscience that they are born with and given by God are the only way to resist this system effectively.
[01:28:41.993 --> 01:28:45.134]  Precisely.
[01:28:45.134 --> 01:28:50.796]  He's either precisely or... That's good.
[01:28:50.796 --> 01:28:55.618]  Oh my God, I just thank God I'm not Zuckerberg or these other weird skegsy people.
[01:28:55.618 --> 01:28:56.298]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:57.697 --> 01:29:02.778]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:02.778 --> 01:29:08.120]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:16.182]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[01:29:16.182 --> 01:29:21.623]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.

[01:29:47.826 --> 01:29:50.127]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:09.952]  By leaps and by bounds.
[01:30:09.952 --> 01:30:16.614]  The number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:30:16.614 --> 01:30:26.696]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:30:26.696 --> 01:30:35.239]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:30:36.059 --> 01:30:37.399]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:30:37.399 --> 01:30:38.560]  You must experience it.
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.520]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:45.561]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:30:45.561 --> 01:30:47.082]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:30:47.082 --> 01:30:48.562]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:30:48.562 --> 01:30:55.244]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:30:55.244 --> 01:30:56.744]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[01:30:58.373 --> 01:31:00.735]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:31:00.735 --> 01:31:07.359]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[01:32:02.119 --> 01:32:03.320]  Focus.
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:04.281]  Clarity.

[01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:03.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.503 --> 01:33:20.085]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:20.085 --> 01:33:34.335]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.335 --> 01:33:35.635]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:33:35.635 --> 01:33:37.076]  Robert Barnes riding shotgun with us.
[01:33:37.076 --> 01:33:45.442]  Laura Loomer also banned for precisely the reason that she is so effective at exposing the censorship that's going on.
[01:33:46.618 --> 01:33:48.258]  Let me throw this out there.
[01:33:48.258 --> 01:33:50.079]  I got a bunch of great crew.
[01:33:50.079 --> 01:33:51.079]  We're doing amazing things.
[01:33:51.079 --> 01:33:52.560]  We got amazing reporters out there.
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:53.300]  We don't give in.
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:54.800]  We don't back down.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:56.420]  We keep dominating.
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:59.261]  One big reason they ended up banning us, Facebook said no a month ago.
[01:33:59.261 --> 01:34:01.762]  I guess Zuckerberg just kind of gave up.
[01:34:01.762 --> 01:34:03.002]  I don't even really blame him at the end of the day.
[01:34:03.002 --> 01:34:07.303]  The more we think about it, I got mad at him earlier, but that's just mad at the general system.
[01:34:07.303 --> 01:34:08.463]  He just said, fine, regulate it.
[01:34:08.463 --> 01:34:09.664]  Take all the speech away.
[01:34:09.664 --> 01:34:12.064]  He just kind of gave in knowing they'd go too far.
[01:34:12.064 --> 01:34:13.485]  I think there's some of that going on here.
[01:34:14.813 --> 01:34:15.854]  This is like the Ring of Mordor.
[01:34:15.854 --> 01:34:19.177]  It's just too dangerous to use.
[01:34:19.177 --> 01:34:21.218]  The censorship is just so out of control.
[01:34:21.218 --> 01:34:24.341]  But I'm going to say this right now.
[01:34:24.341 --> 01:34:27.644]  We have great products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:34:27.644 --> 01:34:31.087]  And we have great information.
[01:34:31.087 --> 01:34:32.168]  And the listeners are awesome.
[01:34:33.271 --> 01:34:45.214]  But yeah, them cutting us out, not letting us have advertising, not letting us advertise, not letting us do so many things, taking our bank accounts away where we had to get higher rate banks to even process orders.
[01:34:45.214 --> 01:34:47.175]  It's been rough.
[01:34:47.175 --> 01:34:50.956]  And I've had a lot of expansion I wanted to do that we weren't able to do because of the attacks.
[01:34:50.956 --> 01:34:54.057]  And I really think America instinctively and the world should double down.
[01:34:55.239 --> 01:34:57.220]  And just say, you know, we're going to back Alex Jones.
[01:34:57.220 --> 01:35:01.502]  My God, they're banning his name and saying you're only allowed to talk about him if it's negative.
[01:35:01.502 --> 01:35:02.483]  Can you imagine that?
[01:35:02.483 --> 01:35:05.064]  And I'm not a victim.
[01:35:05.064 --> 01:35:12.388]  We're obviously doing things here on air that scare the living bejesus out of the enemy.
[01:35:12.388 --> 01:35:22.473]  And so whether you share the links in your own private text, your own private email, or by word of mouth, or on local talk radio, or whether you buy products, whether you pray for us, just keep doing all those things.
[01:35:25.646 --> 01:35:31.567]  Because ladies and gentlemen, I was trying to wolf down some Mexican food during the break.
[01:35:31.567 --> 01:35:32.808]  Mexican food is just too good in Austin.
[01:35:32.808 --> 01:35:36.328]  Even though there's a bunch of commies running around here, they've taken over the Mexican food.
[01:35:36.328 --> 01:35:37.369]  It's like delightful.
[01:35:37.369 --> 01:35:40.409]  Anyways, back to what I was saying.
[01:35:40.409 --> 01:35:43.510]  We need your financial support, and you need the products.
[01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:47.311]  The best fish oil, the best turmeric, the best bone broth, the best...
[01:35:48.942 --> 01:35:58.507]  Things that nobody else is promoting, like Pure Clean Iodine, the very best t-shirts, the very best books, the very best films, whatever the hottest, coolest things are, we have it.
[01:35:58.507 --> 01:36:13.974]  And we have a big special that will have to end soon, our newest special, Survival Shield X2, back in stock, deep-earth crystal, the good halogen, learn why it's so important, learn why it's got thousands and thousands of five-star reviews, 98% reviews, the combo has no reviews because it's brand new.
[01:36:15.387 --> 01:36:23.401]  And X3, a different proprietary iodine with deep-earth crystal, and two other types that some scientists believe is even better and more absorbable.
[01:36:23.401 --> 01:36:24.263]  Try it for yourself.
[01:36:24.263 --> 01:36:25.605]  It's excellent.
[01:36:25.605 --> 01:36:27.629]  Free bottle of X3 with a bottle of X2.
[01:36:29.025 --> 01:36:32.968]  Twenty-five percent off X2, and you get a free bottle.
[01:36:32.968 --> 01:36:36.310]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:46.917]  And everybody knows that I'm so busy that I tend to say a special's over and then it's not over, and I don't throw fits anymore because I just kind of shout orders.
[01:36:46.917 --> 01:36:49.779]  The marketing's like one-minute meetings, you know, twice a week.
[01:36:49.779 --> 01:36:51.801]  They're like, do this, do that, and this and that.
[01:36:51.801 --> 01:36:53.442]  They're like, well, sir, we're about to sell out of...
[01:36:55.734 --> 01:37:01.685]  Rainforest Plus, our top-selling nootropic, and we've got about two weeks left of that, so we probably want to end this free bottle of...
[01:37:03.115 --> 01:37:03.495]  Not yet.
[01:37:34.055 --> 01:37:39.237]  Look at the reviews of X2, look at the reviews of X3, look at the reviews of Knockout and check that out.
[01:37:49.741 --> 01:38:01.974]  Then there was another one before that, 2008 North Carolina law barring registered sex offenders from accessing commercial social media sites was overturned this year, saying it amounts to the public's square.
[01:38:01.974 --> 01:38:03.676]  So we have Supreme Court rulings, don't we?
[01:38:04.264 --> 01:38:06.365]  Well, basically, the original U.S.
[01:38:06.365 --> 01:38:17.572]  Supreme Court logic was that if a company took over the public square and became a company town, then they were obligated to abide by the same First Amendment restrictions as any governmental entity would be.
[01:38:17.572 --> 01:38:20.313]  And so that was originally established by the Supreme Court almost 100 years ago.
[01:38:21.434 --> 01:38:26.339]  Then what happened is the California Supreme Court went further and said that applies to shopping malls.
[01:38:26.339 --> 01:38:31.364]  So if you're in the context of shopping malls, you have to go forward and you have to produce that information and intel.
[01:38:31.364 --> 01:38:34.827]  But in fact, what would happen is that the U.S.
[01:38:34.827 --> 01:38:40.553]  Supreme Court did not extend it ultimately to shopping malls and so what happened after that is that the U.S.
[01:38:40.553 --> 01:38:43.616]  Supreme Court, while it keeps saying in various formats
[01:38:44.036 --> 01:38:48.980]  That there's constitutional protection for the private ownership of the public square.
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:52.703]  They have yet to enforce it against any of the private companies themselves.
[01:38:52.703 --> 01:38:55.085]  And that's the big question, is when will that happen?
[01:38:55.085 --> 01:39:11.879]  Because right now, if we don't move forward, if we don't go forward, if we don't do something significant and substantial, then what's going to happen is that the private monopolies that own the public square are going to be able to control, censor, surveil, and suppress speech in any manner they want, which is what currently is taking place in Transpire.
[01:39:12.299 --> 01:39:29.188]  So the only way to defeat that and overturn that is to say, if you choose to have Section 230 immunity, if you choose to be a public monopoly, effectively is what they are, then you should be obligated to abide by the same First Amendment limits and restrictions as everyone else, as any other governmental entity would be.
[01:39:29.648 --> 01:39:38.882]  So, for example, that's how it was because people had a constitutional right to engage President Trump on Twitter that President Trump is not allowed to black people on Twitter.
[01:39:38.882 --> 01:39:44.590]  Now, apparently some Democratic congressmen haven't got this message, so they're going to be subject to suit about it, but that was the legal premise for it.
[01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:54.293]  So given that same legal premise should apply, unfortunately the courts have yet to apply it to the big tech companies, to the big tech oligopolies.
[01:39:54.293 --> 01:40:12.398]  So Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube have been able to avoid and evade these First Amendment restrictions because the Supreme Court has yet to extend the common sense doctrine they originally imposed on private ownership of the public square to the modern equivalent of private ownership.
[01:40:12.398 --> 01:40:14.499]  President Matt Rudd's a trailblazer for 10 years.
[01:40:14.499 --> 01:40:16.761]  He warned, get out of these ghettos.
[01:40:16.761 --> 01:40:17.762]  We need to surf the web.
[01:40:17.762 --> 01:40:18.622]  We need homepages.
[01:40:18.622 --> 01:40:19.343]  We need individuals.
[01:40:19.343 --> 01:40:20.303]  We need groups.
[01:40:20.303 --> 01:40:21.824]  We don't need these big megacorporations.
[01:40:21.824 --> 01:40:23.205]  They're going to take advantage of you.
[01:40:23.205 --> 01:40:24.606]  They're going to abuse you.
[01:40:24.606 --> 01:40:26.147]  They're going to put you in ghettos.
[01:40:26.147 --> 01:40:26.948]  They've done it now.
[01:40:26.948 --> 01:40:28.429]  He's been proven prophetic.
[01:40:28.429 --> 01:40:29.410]  Absolutely.
[01:40:29.410 --> 01:40:32.592]  Everything he was predicting on that side of the scale was completely true.
[01:40:32.592 --> 01:40:39.537]  And originally what was anticipated, and he was right about this, was that if Hillary had won, they were going to institutionalize these things through the FCC.
[01:40:39.537 --> 01:40:41.418]  But even though Trump won, they're just still going ahead with it.
[01:40:41.678 --> 01:40:41.958]  They are.
[01:40:41.958 --> 01:40:46.560]  I mean, what is is Trump delayed their ability to do so, but also motivated them to do so.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:53.343]  So when it kept expanding, when elections in Hungary and elections in Brazil kept reinforcing it, that's why they're obsessed now with WhatsApp.
[01:40:53.343 --> 01:40:59.806]  It's because WhatsApp was effectively used to circumvent big media censorship and surveillance of the Brazilian election.
[01:41:00.026 --> 01:41:01.767]  We got Laura Loomer coming up.
[01:41:01.767 --> 01:41:02.507]  We got her on.
[01:41:02.507 --> 01:41:04.188]  I haven't played this clip yet.
[01:41:04.188 --> 01:41:05.429]  We only have two minutes to break.
[01:41:05.429 --> 01:41:08.050]  Can you guys go to the end of the Oliver Darcy clip from yesterday?
[01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:09.611]  I'll play the whole thing coming up.
[01:41:09.611 --> 01:41:14.373]  But just the last 30 seconds or so, where he goes, and now we're seeing if Jones is on WhatsApp.
[01:41:14.373 --> 01:41:16.715]  That's a text message phone call system.
[01:41:16.715 --> 01:41:25.599]  So they're saying, well, it's new and it's digital and Facebook owns it, so it can watch what you're doing when you download the app, they give you ads, and now we're going to watch what you say and do.
[01:41:25.599 --> 01:41:27.160]  I mean, this is criminal.
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.721]  The NSA can go to jail for that.
[01:41:29.346 --> 01:41:31.208]  Not only that, you look at Facebook's Messenger app.
[01:41:31.208 --> 01:41:38.035]  Facebook's Messenger app was designed to be able to tap into your phone contacts, tap into your text messages, tap into your private... And that's what they're doing.
[01:41:38.035 --> 01:41:38.696]  Here's that clip.
[01:41:38.696 --> 01:41:41.999]  We'll come back with Laura Loomer, another political prisoner of Freeloomer.com.
[01:41:41.999 --> 01:41:44.742]  Here he is saying, get rid of your right to text message.
[01:41:44.742 --> 01:41:45.103]  Here it is.
[01:41:46.007 --> 01:42:02.639]  Yes, Facebook obviously owns Instagram, and so someone like Alex Jones, who had been banned from Facebook a while back, last year in the summer, but he was still having a presence on Instagram, and that had drawn a lot of scrutiny from people who were saying, hey, you know, you guys banned him from one of your platforms, why are you allowing him to have a presence on Instagram?
[01:42:02.639 --> 01:42:11.205]  And so, yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[01:42:11.205 --> 01:42:15.628]  I checked in also to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook.
[01:42:16.048 --> 01:42:23.792]  And a spokesperson cannot say immediately because it's, I guess, unclear whether some of these people have WhatsApp accounts, according to the spokesperson.
[01:42:23.792 --> 01:42:30.235]  So now they want to get rid of us individually having text message accounts, okay, and phone, so you can call your mommy.
[01:42:30.235 --> 01:42:32.316]  And again, notice they use this thing, oh, he was banned.
[01:42:32.316 --> 01:42:34.497]  Yeah, fake reasons to take down some accounts last year.
[01:42:35.177 --> 01:42:36.037]  So now that's the president.
[01:42:36.037 --> 01:42:37.038]  We'll take him off everything.
[01:42:37.038 --> 01:42:38.038]  We'll put him in a gulag.
[01:42:38.038 --> 01:42:39.279]  We'll put him in a prison.
[01:42:39.279 --> 01:42:40.940]  We'll take away his phones.
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:42.020]  I mean, take away his tech.
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:44.202]  Don't let him write letters out of the prison.
[01:42:44.202 --> 01:42:46.883]  God, what do we let these Americans do next?
[01:42:46.883 --> 01:42:48.904]  Call their children on the phone?
[01:42:48.904 --> 01:42:53.246]  God Almighty, CNN, making sure you can't call your family.
[01:42:53.246 --> 01:42:55.487]  CNN, what good people.
[01:42:55.487 --> 01:42:56.628]  These are good people.
[01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:04.905]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[01:43:04.905 --> 01:43:08.568]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[01:43:08.568 --> 01:43:10.190]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:12.892]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[01:43:12.892 --> 01:43:14.373]  You're our only sponsors.
[01:43:14.373 --> 01:43:20.838]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[01:43:20.838 --> 01:43:22.780]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:24.341]  I'm not the leader.
[01:43:24.341 --> 01:43:25.143]  You are the leader.
[01:43:25.143 --> 01:43:27.125]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[01:43:27.125 --> 01:43:32.532]  We've got giant specials running right now at m4wrestore.com that are unprecedented.
[01:43:32.532 --> 01:43:39.982]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[01:43:40.262 --> 01:43:43.084]  So I want to thank you for your support, and I want to encourage you again.
[01:43:43.084 --> 01:43:48.007]  Go to infowarestore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[01:43:48.007 --> 01:43:51.168]  We have thousands of them, and it makes this all possible.
[01:43:51.168 --> 01:43:53.270]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.730]  God bless you.
[01:43:57.176 --> 01:44:02.377]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:44:02.377 --> 01:44:10.939]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:44:10.939 --> 01:44:13.920]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:15.660]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:21.942]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[01:44:24.042 --> 01:44:29.364]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[01:44:29.364 --> 01:44:32.306]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:44:32.306 --> 01:44:35.907]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:44:35.907 --> 01:44:40.229]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:42.050]  I've got two in my home.
[01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:48.132]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:44:48.132 --> 01:44:48.973]  Don't live
[01:44:49.793 --> 01:44:53.874]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[01:44:53.874 --> 01:44:58.276]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:58.276 --> 01:45:03.718]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[01:45:03.718 --> 01:45:05.498]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[01:45:05.498 --> 01:45:07.259]  Now I can be there for my children.
[01:45:07.259 --> 01:45:09.080]  Now I can make them strong.
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:10.740]  Now I can instruct them.
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:13.461]  Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[01:45:13.561 --> 01:45:18.684]  You think in this digital age, your word's going forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:45:18.684 --> 01:45:24.288]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:45:24.288 --> 01:45:27.931]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:45:27.931 --> 01:45:28.951]  I can't be destroyed now.
[01:45:28.951 --> 01:45:34.295]  As long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth, and you can't be destroyed either.
[01:45:34.295 --> 01:45:43.461]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it, and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[01:45:43.561 --> 01:45:51.164]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:45:51.164 --> 01:45:58.887]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[01:45:58.887 --> 01:46:04.889]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:04.889 --> 01:46:07.850]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:12.412]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of MyPatriotSupply, one of the top
[01:46:13.484 --> 01:46:22.609]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:27.971]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:46:27.971 --> 01:46:30.253]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:46:30.253 --> 01:46:33.754]  MFORESTORE.com on MFORESELECT storable foods.
[01:46:33.754 --> 01:46:35.235]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:46:35.235 --> 01:46:39.217]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:46:39.217 --> 01:46:41.438]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:46:41.438 --> 01:46:42.519]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:46:42.979 --> 01:46:44.961]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:46:44.961 --> 01:46:47.483]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:46:47.483 --> 01:46:52.507]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:46:52.507 --> 01:47:01.255]  InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWars Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:47:01.255 --> 01:47:03.937]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.783 --> 01:47:25.464]  You walk into this room.
[01:47:25.464 --> 01:47:29.864]  You know, Laura Loomer's with us the next few segments.
[01:47:29.864 --> 01:47:33.745]  We've got Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, riding shotgun with us.
[01:47:33.745 --> 01:47:49.848]  If you just tuned in, CNN is now trying to get into the accounts of Laura Loomer, Alex Jones, and others to see if we have apps that allow us to text people WhatsApp.
[01:47:49.848 --> 01:47:50.988]  That's private phone calls.
[01:47:52.555 --> 01:47:56.436]  And they admit in their own review of me a month ago that I didn't say any semitic stuff.
[01:47:56.436 --> 01:47:58.896]  And by the way, if I did, people have a right to say that.
[01:47:58.896 --> 01:48:01.017]  That's the open marketplace if I did.
[01:48:01.017 --> 01:48:02.077]  Everybody knows that's not true.
[01:48:02.077 --> 01:48:02.937]  But what about Laura Lummer?
[01:48:02.937 --> 01:48:04.177]  She's Jewish.
[01:48:04.177 --> 01:48:05.298]  She's pro-Israel.
[01:48:05.298 --> 01:48:07.358]  She goes to Israel.
[01:48:07.358 --> 01:48:08.658]  She's been called a white supremacist.
[01:48:08.658 --> 01:48:11.499]  I remember when she was in Congress yelling about censorship last year.
[01:48:11.499 --> 01:48:15.880]  They said, oh, the white supremacist, Laura Lummer, the defamation is cuckoo land.
[01:48:16.673 --> 01:48:18.534]  Well, you go, oh, well, they're the mainstream media.
[01:48:18.534 --> 01:48:19.635]  They don't, no one believes them.
[01:48:19.635 --> 01:48:20.596]  It doesn't matter.
[01:48:20.596 --> 01:48:22.157]  They say it, it becomes reality.
[01:48:22.157 --> 01:48:28.762]  And here's their internal documents, Mr. Barnes, we'll go to Loomer, saying, we know these people aren't these things, they still ban us.
[01:48:28.762 --> 01:48:31.865]  That's a big deal we have that, because this is for political purposes.
[01:48:32.245 --> 01:48:32.866]  Oh, no question.
[01:48:32.866 --> 01:48:42.016]  I mean, so their own internal protocols, their own internal procedures, their own internal people looked at this, investigated it, and determined there was no basis to find any violation of the terms of service.
[01:48:42.016 --> 01:48:49.604]  And then they put out there, hey, by the way, if a bunch of people comment on someone's Instagram to a certain number, then maybe we can use that to ban it.
[01:48:49.604 --> 01:48:52.507]  Well, that was unsuccessful, too, because there were too many positive followers.
[01:48:52.507 --> 01:48:54.009]  Hang on, it's only 4% anti-Semitic!
[01:48:54.409 --> 01:48:55.049]  Exactly.
[01:48:55.049 --> 01:48:56.550]  They wanted more, but they couldn't get more.
[01:48:56.550 --> 01:49:08.458]  And even when they had the troll farms on the left trying to barrage people to try to create a fake story that didn't otherwise exist, they were not successful because there were too many good followers and positive followers who were like, this is, this is, who supported it.
[01:49:08.458 --> 01:49:09.039]  It's incredible.
[01:49:09.039 --> 01:49:13.662]  We're going to get where you think this is going, but Laura Loomer, what do you think they're doing here?
[01:49:13.662 --> 01:49:14.683]  Obviously you're effective.
[01:49:14.683 --> 01:49:17.124]  You're out exposing the attack on free speech.
[01:49:17.124 --> 01:49:17.985]  What is Trump doing?
[01:49:17.985 --> 01:49:19.186]  I mean, you've obviously got a lot of points.
[01:49:19.186 --> 01:49:21.727]  You're one of the four people banned.
[01:49:21.727 --> 01:49:23.849]  Obviously we're all nationalistic conservatives.
[01:49:24.889 --> 01:49:27.551]  I think they threw Farrakhan in just to make it not look political.
[01:49:27.551 --> 01:49:29.693]  But what's your take on this, Laura Loomer?
[01:49:29.693 --> 01:49:32.375]  Fellow thought criminal, you're in a very elite group.
[01:49:32.375 --> 01:49:34.436]  Now, they said, I'm the most fan, though.
[01:49:34.436 --> 01:49:38.940]  You're not allowed to say my name or in force unless it's negative.
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:41.962]  So, Laura, you're not as powerful as me yet.
[01:49:41.962 --> 01:49:43.463]  You're working your way up there, though.
[01:49:45.123 --> 01:49:46.544]  Yeah, thanks for having me on Alex.
[01:49:46.544 --> 01:49:47.985]  Well, they're just trying to kill us.
[01:49:47.985 --> 01:49:49.245]  You want to know what they're trying to do?
[01:49:49.245 --> 01:49:50.526]  They want us dead.
[01:49:50.526 --> 01:49:59.531]  That's why yesterday Facebook literally designated me and you and Milo and Paul Joseph Watson and others as designated terrorists.
[01:49:59.531 --> 01:50:04.273]  If you look at their description of us on their website, they called us dangerous individuals.
[01:50:04.273 --> 01:50:05.574]  And if you go to the Facebook
[01:50:06.275 --> 01:50:09.317]  Uh, description of what it means to be a dangerous individual.
[01:50:09.317 --> 01:50:15.102]  Well, you have to be promoting mass murder or violence or be a terrorist or be encouraging mass violence.
[01:50:15.102 --> 01:50:15.782]  I have never done that.
[01:50:15.782 --> 01:50:16.422]  No, no, no, you're right.
[01:50:16.422 --> 01:50:21.706]  I laugh about this and the whole, the whole name of the show is journalists designated as terrorists.
[01:50:21.706 --> 01:50:23.808]  Facebook tries to kill journalists.
[01:50:23.808 --> 01:50:25.089]  I mean, no, no, no, you're right.
[01:50:25.089 --> 01:50:28.331]  In fact, Watson looked it up and it's actually in the filing.
[01:50:28.331 --> 01:50:29.552]  They normally only would say that.
[01:50:29.552 --> 01:50:32.234]  I mean, Hezbollah and Hamas still have accounts we don't.
[01:50:32.972 --> 01:50:38.395]  Right, yeah, and that's the basis of my lawsuit against Twitter, which people have been so reluctant to share.
[01:50:38.395 --> 01:50:39.155]  I don't know why.
[01:50:39.155 --> 01:50:41.136]  You know, look, Alex, I'm going to be very frank with you.
[01:50:41.136 --> 01:50:46.059]  I am so sick and tired of watching conservatives complain about social media.
[01:50:46.059 --> 01:50:47.319]  You have two choices.
[01:50:47.319 --> 01:50:48.880]  You either fight or you don't fight.
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:51.802]  And if you don't want to fight, then stay the hell away from me.
[01:50:51.802 --> 01:50:53.002]  No, I totally agree!
[01:50:53.002 --> 01:50:55.824]  A lot of conservatives are glad Farrakhan's being censored.
[01:50:55.824 --> 01:50:56.244]  No!
[01:50:56.244 --> 01:50:57.905]  They're censoring everybody, you idiots!
[01:50:59.286 --> 01:51:04.067]  Every single time someone gets banned, it turns into a circus and everyone says, oh, oh, everyone's banned.
[01:51:04.067 --> 01:51:05.368]  Oh, President Trump, help us.
[01:51:05.368 --> 01:51:07.048]  Please do something, okay?
[01:51:07.048 --> 01:51:08.129]  But what are they doing?
[01:51:08.129 --> 01:51:12.750]  Is anyone giving me money to fund my lawsuit in which I'm suing Twitter and Care?
[01:51:12.750 --> 01:51:20.392]  Because Care, which is a designated Islamic terrorist organization tied to Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, lobbied Facebook and Twitter to ban me.
[01:51:20.392 --> 01:51:25.734]  Like, do people not understand that those of us who have been silenced have actually taken legal action?
[01:51:25.854 --> 01:51:27.396]  I don't think they get it's a total war.
[01:51:27.396 --> 01:51:28.458]  No, I totally agree.
[01:51:28.458 --> 01:51:30.401]  People need to pony up and support you.
[01:51:30.401 --> 01:51:31.041]  They need to support us.
[01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:35.372]  I want people to actually do something.
[01:51:35.372 --> 01:51:35.612]  Okay?
[01:51:35.612 --> 01:51:36.452]  We need your money.
[01:51:36.452 --> 01:51:37.633]  We need your support.
[01:51:37.633 --> 01:51:38.994]  Help fund my lawsuit.
[01:51:38.994 --> 01:51:42.896]  Give me some money to fund my lawsuit so I can take these people and defeat them in court.
[01:51:42.896 --> 01:51:43.476]  Okay?
[01:51:43.476 --> 01:51:50.800]  Where were all the conservatives the other night when I projected your name and InfoWars and everybody who has been banned onto the home of Jack Dorsey?
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:53.441]  Not a single conservative tweeted my video.
[01:51:53.441 --> 01:51:55.682]  Not a single conservative tweeted my video.
[01:51:55.682 --> 01:51:57.243]  And two days later, we were all banned.
[01:51:57.583 --> 01:51:58.623]  So I don't want to hear it.
[01:51:58.623 --> 01:52:06.365]  I don't want to hear all these people complain about censorship, because when I text them, when I'm literally standing at Jack Dorsey's house in San Francisco... No, I agree.
[01:52:06.365 --> 01:52:07.485]  They're all a bunch of cowards.
[01:52:07.485 --> 01:52:14.127]  They want to wait and watch you and I and others go out and fight, and then we get banned, and they sit back, and then, of course, they get banned later.
[01:52:14.127 --> 01:52:15.907]  And, of course, I was just talking to Bob while you were talking.
[01:52:15.907 --> 01:52:16.567]  He's a good lawyer.
[01:52:16.567 --> 01:52:18.068]  He says your lawyer's really good.
[01:52:18.068 --> 01:52:19.228]  Your lawsuit against Twitter's good.
[01:52:19.748 --> 01:52:22.070]  We're suing PayPal and others.
[01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:23.811]  We are going to sue Facebook now.
[01:52:23.811 --> 01:52:25.712]  We are going to sue the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:52:25.712 --> 01:52:27.113]  Because we have to.
[01:52:27.113 --> 01:52:29.795]  They're the ones that create the list saying we're Nazis.
[01:52:29.795 --> 01:52:32.457]  They're the ones that create the TV shows that say come out and attack us.
[01:52:32.457 --> 01:52:35.199]  They're the ones saying take our bank accounts, don't let us travel.
[01:52:35.199 --> 01:52:38.762]  They're the ones now that won't let you use Airbnb or Uber.
[01:52:38.762 --> 01:52:40.203]  And it's happening to me now.
[01:52:40.203 --> 01:52:44.486]  These leftists are in our accounts terrorizing us and Trump... Let me tell you something.
[01:52:45.066 --> 01:52:46.467]  I like Trump because he's not Hillary Clinton.
[01:52:46.467 --> 01:52:47.348]  He's done some good.
[01:52:47.348 --> 01:52:49.169]  But I'm starting to get pissed.
[01:52:49.169 --> 01:52:55.374]  I'm starting to get pissed at him and Jared Kushner, who I know meets with Google, and everybody else.
[01:52:55.374 --> 01:52:57.255]  They better do something.
[01:52:57.255 --> 01:52:59.117]  What the hell is their problem?
[01:52:59.117 --> 01:53:00.478]  This isn't about censorship now.
[01:53:00.478 --> 01:53:01.559]  It's racketeering.
[01:53:01.559 --> 01:53:02.740]  They're in our bank accounts.
[01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:06.823]  They're saying conservatives won't be able to send text messages because Trump's done nothing.
[01:53:06.823 --> 01:53:07.964]  He's green-lighted this.
[01:53:09.292 --> 01:53:11.313]  Well, I've given my life for President Trump.
[01:53:11.313 --> 01:53:12.774]  I mean, how do you think I feel?
[01:53:12.774 --> 01:53:16.256]  You know, from the time I was 20 years old, I started working for Project Veritas.
[01:53:16.256 --> 01:53:22.360]  I was undercover in the Hillary Clinton campaign, exposing the Hillary Clinton campaign, and exposing them for voter fraud.
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:27.983]  President Trump tweeted my undercover videos, probably without even knowing who I was, when he was running for president.
[01:53:27.983 --> 01:53:31.025]  Rosanna, for a long time, you've been a dangerous frontline activity.
[01:53:32.056 --> 01:53:35.997]  I've given my life and my career for President Trump and not once has he called me.
[01:53:35.997 --> 01:53:37.678]  Not once has he tweeted me.
[01:53:37.678 --> 01:53:39.699]  Not once has he said thank you.
[01:53:39.699 --> 01:53:40.679]  Because they don't get it.
[01:53:40.679 --> 01:53:45.021]  We're the battle-hardened people with blood and guts hanging out because we're on the front line.
[01:53:45.021 --> 01:53:49.342]  And all these little pretty ninnies go, don't get involved with the combat troops.
[01:53:49.342 --> 01:53:50.403]  Stand back from them.
[01:53:50.403 --> 01:53:52.103]  They've been attacked by the system.
[01:53:52.103 --> 01:53:53.784]  Yeah, because we're up front.
[01:53:53.784 --> 01:53:55.725]  We're fighting fire-breathing dragons.
[01:53:55.725 --> 01:53:57.005]  We're bleeding.
[01:53:57.005 --> 01:54:00.066]  And then everybody sits back as we've been demonized and go, stay away from them.
[01:54:00.066 --> 01:54:00.987]  They've been in combat.
[01:54:03.168 --> 01:54:04.809]  Why not stay away from Trump then?
[01:54:04.809 --> 01:54:06.190]  All the lies they tell about him.
[01:54:06.190 --> 01:54:08.191]  Trump has to get this.
[01:54:08.191 --> 01:54:11.073]  They just read my Wikipedia page and they call me crazy.
[01:54:11.073 --> 01:54:17.217]  You know, I'm so sick and tired of seeing conservatives online like the Ben Shapiro types and all these establishment types mock me and call me crazy.
[01:54:17.217 --> 01:54:19.079]  They're playing it safe, Laura.
[01:54:19.079 --> 01:54:20.500]  They don't have the huevos you've got.
[01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:21.560]  They're playing it safe.
[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:31.207]  These are pretenders that were even against Trump who jumped on the bandwagon and now they're all cozied up to Trump and everybody because they're the little cutesies that Google leaves alone.
[01:54:32.352 --> 01:54:37.294]  Yeah, well, I don't need all these men who sit behind their Twitter accounts talking crap about me.
[01:54:37.294 --> 01:54:39.796]  Because, first of all, I have bigger balls than all these men combined.
[01:54:39.796 --> 01:54:45.779]  And if they want to talk about me and call me crazy, then they can go confront Jack Dorsey in front of Congress.
[01:54:45.779 --> 01:54:50.601]  Or they can go confront, like we did together, or they can go to Nancy Pelosi's house like you did.
[01:54:50.601 --> 01:54:51.502]  Absolutely.
[01:54:51.502 --> 01:54:52.642]  No, you're an example, Lauren.
[01:54:52.642 --> 01:54:53.362]  It's true.
[01:54:53.362 --> 01:54:57.745]  That's why you always get criticized and attacked by all the backbenchers and all the people that aren't in the damn arena.
[01:54:57.745 --> 01:54:58.865]  I don't want to hear their crap.
[01:54:58.865 --> 01:54:59.646]  They need to be in the arena.
[01:54:59.646 --> 01:54:59.886]  Barnes?
[01:55:00.806 --> 01:55:01.487]  No question about it.
[01:55:01.487 --> 01:55:06.449]  I mean, the suit that's been brought on her behalf by Ron Coleman, who's one of the best lawyers in the country, good in this area.
[01:55:06.449 --> 01:55:10.732]  He's also doing the suit for Gavin McInnes against the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:55:10.732 --> 01:55:21.198]  It's brought in Florida, and it's brought on some legal theories that Ron and I have discussed for several years, which is to how to go at social media in ways to get past the sense of immunity that judges think they have.
[01:55:21.198 --> 01:55:22.319]  Because they don't!
[01:55:22.319 --> 01:55:24.220]  They're acting like horrible racketeers!
[01:55:24.620 --> 01:55:25.641]  Oh, no question.
[01:55:25.641 --> 01:55:30.564]  And the interesting thing is some of the suits they're bringing against other people are going to establish the precedent to bring suits against them.
[01:55:30.564 --> 01:55:32.685]  Probably they didn't think that through all the way.
[01:55:32.685 --> 01:55:43.593]  But so, for example, he's pursuing things like tortious interference because the allegation is that essentially CARE, which is an organization that has been designated... CARE is in the Washington Post saying, I'm an anti-Semite.
[01:55:43.593 --> 01:55:45.013]  And her name's there too!
[01:55:45.013 --> 01:55:47.635]  A bunch of Islamists saying that she's anti-Israel.
[01:55:47.635 --> 01:55:48.656]  This is a load of crap!
[01:55:49.216 --> 01:55:56.462]  And what he identifies in the suit is that CARE has been previously identified as affiliated with various actual terrorist causes and cases.
[01:55:56.462 --> 01:55:57.382]  Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:55:57.382 --> 01:55:58.323]  Correct.
[01:55:58.323 --> 01:56:06.369]  So when you look at that, what you have is CARE using their political power and their economic connections with Facebook and social media to try to target certain people.
[01:56:07.089 --> 01:56:10.072]  The new thing is if you criticize radical Islam, you're banned.
[01:56:10.072 --> 01:56:11.653]  They say that in the Washington Post.
[01:56:11.653 --> 01:56:17.858]  What they've done is they did what Loomer's case is about in Florida against CARE and against Twitter.
[01:56:17.858 --> 01:56:19.800]  They've taken to an entirely new level now.
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:29.488]  Because now they have CNN, you have guys like Oliver Darcy going on CNN saying, hey, by the way, I'm basically trying to cause you to not be able to use WhatsApp.
[01:56:29.488 --> 01:56:31.670]  The way he puts it is... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:56:32.657 --> 01:56:34.098]  No, we're gonna hold you over.
[01:56:34.098 --> 01:56:34.819]  Go ahead.
[01:56:34.819 --> 01:56:36.020]  Go ahead, Laura.
[01:56:36.020 --> 01:56:38.161]  This is why I'm so curious.
[01:56:38.161 --> 01:56:43.205]  Why are people, and I hate to make it all about myself, but I have been defamed, okay?
[01:56:43.205 --> 01:56:44.887]  My life has been destroyed.
[01:56:44.887 --> 01:56:49.070]  My life has been ruined, Alex, by people who have defamed me online.
[01:56:49.070 --> 01:56:53.593]  I am 25 years old, and it will probably be like this for the rest of my life.
[01:56:53.593 --> 01:56:55.155]  I confronted Oliver Darcy.
[01:56:55.155 --> 01:56:57.657]  Do you remember when I chased him at CPAC down the hallway?
[01:56:57.657 --> 01:56:57.977]  Yes.
[01:56:58.677 --> 01:57:02.921]  I said, Oliver, why are you working with Twitter and Facebook to ban people like Alex Jones?
[01:57:02.921 --> 01:57:05.263]  How much are you getting paid to ban conservatives?
[01:57:05.263 --> 01:57:06.424]  And then what happened?
[01:57:06.424 --> 01:57:10.847]  Matt Schlapp, okay, he had me banned from CPAC right before... Let's expand on that.
[01:57:10.847 --> 01:57:11.828]  We're gonna hold you over.
[01:57:11.828 --> 01:57:17.933]  Oliver Darcy on CNN yesterday, when we were banned, you were banned, looked like he was having an orgasm.
[01:57:17.933 --> 01:57:23.417]  And he had to hold his, he was like crazed, like, we've got them, and now we need to take, and they can't make phone calls!
[01:57:24.858 --> 01:57:27.779]  I mean, it's like, God, that's the villain, man!
[01:57:27.779 --> 01:57:28.619]  That's the enemy!
[01:57:28.619 --> 01:57:33.240]  This un-American rat is on TV saying, they shouldn't be able to make phone calls now.
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:34.641]  I'm in their phones, though.
[01:57:34.641 --> 01:57:35.441]  Look at them band.
[01:57:35.441 --> 01:57:41.443]  I mean, what planet are we on?
[01:57:41.443 --> 01:57:43.263]  Is this still America?
[01:57:43.263 --> 01:57:45.724]  And Trump, get off your ass!

[01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:53.196]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA Region 6.
[01:58:53.196 --> 01:58:55.219]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[01:58:55.219 --> 01:58:56.300]  Good to talk to you.
[01:58:56.300 --> 01:59:00.946]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[01:59:00.946 --> 01:59:02.888]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[01:59:02.888 --> 01:59:07.454]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[01:59:07.714 --> 01:59:13.700]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:14.480]  I appreciate that.
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:16.082]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:16.682]  Tell us about it.
[01:59:16.682 --> 01:59:17.443]  Well, it's really great.
[01:59:17.443 --> 01:59:18.744]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:59:18.744 --> 01:59:19.265]  I take it.
[01:59:19.265 --> 01:59:20.005]  It tastes good.
[01:59:20.005 --> 01:59:21.867]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:59:21.867 --> 01:59:23.809]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[01:59:23.809 --> 01:59:27.292]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[01:59:27.312 --> 01:59:30.133]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:59:30.133 --> 01:59:31.893]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[01:59:31.893 --> 01:59:33.974]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:59:33.974 --> 01:59:37.335]  So yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[01:59:37.335 --> 01:59:40.156]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[01:59:40.156 --> 01:59:41.296]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[01:59:41.296 --> 01:59:42.016]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:42.016 --> 01:59:43.797]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:04.002 --> 02:00:04.086]  Yeah.
[02:00:27.149 --> 02:00:44.195]  He's been banned too as a hate leader and it's in their emails that Facebook put out that well we can call people hate leaders then we can just ban them outright.
[02:00:44.195 --> 02:00:52.138]  So it's this designation, this literal yellow star that they put on you, this scarlet letter and we're talking right out of Laura Loomer.
[02:00:53.180 --> 02:00:58.084]  With a t-shirt of FreeLumer.com.
[02:00:58.084 --> 02:01:00.545]  Why do you think they've done this?
[02:01:00.545 --> 02:01:03.207]  I guess because they see Trump greenlighting it?
[02:01:03.207 --> 02:01:07.090]  Not doing anything so far?
[02:01:07.090 --> 02:01:07.950]  I get you're pissed off.
[02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:08.831]  You're fighting hard.
[02:01:08.831 --> 02:01:10.272]  Every time I'm in the trenches I see you there.
[02:01:14.658 --> 02:01:16.119]  What do you think Trump should do?
[02:01:16.119 --> 02:01:17.220]  What should we do?
[02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:18.261]  Where do you see this going?
[02:01:18.261 --> 02:01:22.846]  Because Trump doesn't get his own videos get banned and shadow banned and blocked when we promote them.
[02:01:22.846 --> 02:01:25.088]  I mean, Trump just thinks, well, I can overpower this myself.
[02:01:25.088 --> 02:01:25.969]  No, you can't.
[02:01:25.969 --> 02:01:31.754]  Plus, if he doesn't do something, he's aiding and abetting this.
[02:01:31.754 --> 02:01:33.416]  What do you think, Laura?
[02:01:33.416 --> 02:01:33.616]  Yeah.
[02:01:35.558 --> 02:01:37.198]  Well, I wish that he would do something.
[02:01:37.198 --> 02:01:45.520]  Like I said, I confronted Congress, and when Jack Dorsey was testifying in September, and I begged President Trump, I begged him to do something before it was too late.
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:50.221]  And that was when I still had access to my Twitter account, right?
[02:01:50.221 --> 02:01:51.781]  But I was mocked, right?
[02:01:51.781 --> 02:01:55.862]  Look at that asshole, Billy Long, in Congress, who decided to do an auction call over me.
[02:02:00.185 --> 02:02:02.927]  It's mocked me and called me crazy, but what are they doing?
[02:02:02.927 --> 02:02:06.290]  I want to know what people are actually going to do!
[02:02:06.290 --> 02:02:08.172]  My life is ruined!
[02:02:08.172 --> 02:02:12.355]  Does anybody understand how ruined my life is?
[02:02:12.355 --> 02:02:13.176]  I'm sick of it!
[02:02:13.176 --> 02:02:16.779]  I don't want to listen to people tell me that I'm a conspiracy theorist!
[02:02:16.779 --> 02:02:18.861]  They don't know what it's like to be me!
[02:02:18.861 --> 02:02:21.083]  My fucking life is ruined, Alex!
[02:02:22.725 --> 02:02:23.466]  No, I understand.
[02:02:23.466 --> 02:02:26.288]  I just think you need to go with it.
[02:02:26.288 --> 02:02:27.008]  I understand.
[02:02:27.008 --> 02:02:28.629]  I've been through this myself.
[02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:29.730]  But realize, these are wars.
[02:02:29.730 --> 02:02:30.751]  These are hard.
[02:02:30.751 --> 02:02:31.952]  But I know your frustration, Lori.
[02:02:31.952 --> 02:02:34.794]  You wouldn't feel bad if more men were standing up.
[02:02:34.794 --> 02:02:36.275]  You know, Drudge Report promotes what you're doing.
[02:02:36.275 --> 02:02:36.775]  Others do.
[02:02:36.775 --> 02:02:39.977]  The President actually did tweet about you.
[02:02:39.977 --> 02:02:44.801]  And I don't know if you knew this, about you and Watson being banned.
[02:02:44.801 --> 02:02:46.682]  I mean, I agree.
[02:02:46.682 --> 02:02:49.444]  Tweeting isn't enough, but at least the President is concerned about it.
[02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:55.871]  Okay, he's concerned about it, but that's not going to stop the fact that I've lost 90% of my income.
[02:02:55.871 --> 02:03:01.252]  That's not going to stop the fact that I literally can't make a living anymore, even though I have a degree.
[02:03:01.252 --> 02:03:03.133]  I was valedictorian in college.
[02:03:03.133 --> 02:03:06.674]  I graduated top of my class in my journalism program.
[02:03:06.674 --> 02:03:07.894]  And I can't have- No, I get it.
[02:03:07.894 --> 02:03:16.597]  You've been in the trenches six years and delivered nothing but the goods, and then now you're wondering, as a soldier in this fight, why nobody even will give you a can of beans.
[02:03:18.032 --> 02:03:18.492]  Nobody!
[02:03:18.492 --> 02:03:19.253]  And I'm sick of it!
[02:03:19.253 --> 02:03:21.333]  I'm fighting harder than most conservatives!
[02:03:21.333 --> 02:03:23.374]  I'm fighting harder than anybody!
[02:03:23.374 --> 02:03:24.555]  And I'm being destroyed!
[02:03:24.555 --> 02:03:27.376]  And they mock me and they say I'm some crazy conspiracy!
[02:03:27.376 --> 02:03:30.217]  Well, that's what happens, Laura, to leaders.
[02:03:30.217 --> 02:03:31.918]  But I hear you.
[02:03:31.918 --> 02:03:35.499]  And Trump's been so surrounded by the Russiagate thing that he's been paralyzed by that.
[02:03:35.499 --> 02:03:38.040]  But he better do something now.
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:39.521]  No, I agree with you.
[02:03:39.521 --> 02:03:43.163]  I'm sick of watching all this stuff go on.
[02:03:43.163 --> 02:03:45.644]  And I'm pissed, too.
[02:03:45.644 --> 02:03:46.284]  I hear what you're saying.
[02:03:47.009 --> 02:03:50.970]  These people don't understand, like, my life is unlivable at this point in time.
[02:03:50.970 --> 02:03:52.851]  Like, what is the point?
[02:03:52.851 --> 02:03:53.611]  What is the point?
[02:03:53.611 --> 02:03:54.571]  Don't say that, Laura.
[02:03:54.571 --> 02:03:56.852]  You're a hero to a lot of people.
[02:03:56.852 --> 02:04:01.733]  I'm 25 years old and I don't want to live the rest of my life.
[02:04:01.733 --> 02:04:04.734]  I could potentially live 75 more years, you know what I'm saying?
[02:04:04.734 --> 02:04:10.456]  And like, my life now, I have to worry about getting murdered by leftists and Muslims every single time I go outside.
[02:04:10.456 --> 02:04:10.736]  Oh, I know.
[02:04:10.736 --> 02:04:11.716]  It's disgusting.
[02:04:11.716 --> 02:04:12.316]  Oh, I know.
[02:04:12.316 --> 02:04:12.556]  I know.
[02:04:12.556 --> 02:04:13.477]  They're so protected.
[02:04:13.477 --> 02:04:14.237]  It's so sick.
[02:04:15.177 --> 02:04:16.478]  I've reached out to people.
[02:04:16.478 --> 02:04:18.740]  I've reached out to people in the Trump administration.
[02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:22.342]  I've reached out to people like Charlie... Well, most of them are cowards.
[02:04:22.342 --> 02:04:23.903]  They're just hangers-on.
[02:04:23.903 --> 02:04:26.185]  We got Trump elected and all the parasites came in.
[02:04:26.185 --> 02:04:28.687]  And just remember, it's better than Hillary, but I understand.
[02:04:28.687 --> 02:04:30.088]  Well, keep doing it.
[02:04:30.088 --> 02:04:31.388]  Let's get you back on soon.
[02:04:31.388 --> 02:04:35.551]  Get you back on the mark about what you're doing next, how folks support you, and we'll track this as it unfolds.
[02:04:35.551 --> 02:04:37.113]  But I know being called an anti-Semite...
[02:04:37.913 --> 02:04:45.567]  My Zuckerberg and all them is painful, and I know it hurts, and I know it's a lie, and I know you feel alone right now, but it's always darkest before the dawn, Laura.
[02:04:45.567 --> 02:04:46.348]  God bless you.
[02:04:46.348 --> 02:04:47.170]  Laura Loomer, folks.
[02:04:47.170 --> 02:04:48.492]  FreeLoomer.com.
[02:04:48.492 --> 02:04:49.274]  Support her.
[02:04:49.274 --> 02:04:50.416]  We'll come back with Mr. Barnes.
[02:04:50.416 --> 02:04:50.856]  Thank you, Laura.
[02:04:56.081 --> 02:05:01.283]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:05:01.283 --> 02:05:09.847]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:05:09.847 --> 02:05:12.829]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:05:12.829 --> 02:05:14.569]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:05:14.569 --> 02:05:20.852]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[02:05:22.933 --> 02:05:28.257]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[02:05:28.257 --> 02:05:31.219]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:05:31.219 --> 02:05:34.821]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:05:34.821 --> 02:05:39.124]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:05:39.124 --> 02:05:40.945]  I've got two in my home.
[02:05:40.945 --> 02:05:47.049]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[02:05:47.049 --> 02:05:47.890]  Don't live
[02:05:48.730 --> 02:05:52.413]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[02:05:52.413 --> 02:06:08.543]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:06:08.543 --> 02:06:12.946]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[02:06:12.946 --> 02:06:14.407]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.787 --> 02:06:21.369]  Folks, we think we've been winning.
[02:06:21.369 --> 02:06:22.910]  We think Trump's turned a lot of stuff around.
[02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:23.671]  You've turned a lot of stuff around.
[02:06:23.671 --> 02:06:26.474]  But the enemy is striking back.
[02:06:26.474 --> 02:06:28.976]  They've got leftists embedded all over the Republican Party.
[02:06:28.976 --> 02:06:30.257]  They've got them in the media and all.
[02:06:30.257 --> 02:06:32.920]  The average Republican leader is like 70-something years old.
[02:06:32.920 --> 02:06:34.581]  They still believe CNN.
[02:06:34.581 --> 02:06:38.085]  They don't know CNN has 100,000 viewers on average.
[02:06:38.085 --> 02:06:40.487]  Then we've got, you know, a million per hour.
[02:06:40.487 --> 02:06:44.171]  But Candace Owens, great lady, so awesome.
[02:06:46.152 --> 02:06:48.955]  It's really discovered by Paul Watson and Infowars.
[02:06:48.955 --> 02:06:54.201]  Resigns from Turning Point USA after calls for her to be fired.
[02:06:54.201 --> 02:07:02.250]  And people inside Turning Point USA, literally going along with the mainstream media, and that out of context thing about Hitler is that a black woman likes Hitler.
[02:07:02.250 --> 02:07:05.053]  She's talking about nationalists versus non-nationalists who said he wasn't a nationalist.
[02:07:06.698 --> 02:07:10.619]  And she resigned from her position, even though she knocked it out of the park in Congress.
[02:07:10.619 --> 02:07:12.280]  She's so beautiful, so smart.
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:15.540]  Hey Candace, now that you get it, go get a job here.
[02:07:15.540 --> 02:07:19.402]  We tried to hire her and she got busy and they all swooped in on her.
[02:07:19.402 --> 02:07:21.222]  So just come back to Papa.
[02:07:21.222 --> 02:07:23.243]  You know, I mean, we won't censor you.
[02:07:23.243 --> 02:07:26.163]  We know you're not this BS.
[02:07:26.163 --> 02:07:27.084]  It's just incredible.
[02:07:27.084 --> 02:07:27.964]  I was scheduled to be on her
[02:07:29.414 --> 02:07:29.694]  I don't
[02:07:53.388 --> 02:07:56.412]  Turning Point USA, that's all they had was Candace Owens.
[02:07:56.412 --> 02:07:59.256]  So they were saying she's an anti-Semite.
[02:07:59.256 --> 02:07:59.957]  Everyone in D.C.
[02:07:59.957 --> 02:08:04.022]  wants to roll over to corporate media and roll over to Democrats as double agents.
[02:08:04.022 --> 02:08:04.663]  They come and they say...
[02:08:06.943 --> 02:08:12.847]  We're going to audit you and destroy you unless you give us intel on Trump, unless you sabotage new whisper campaigns.
[02:08:12.847 --> 02:08:17.870]  And then people that roll over, they go, now we know that you sold out the president, we're going to tell him if you don't.
[02:08:17.870 --> 02:08:19.070]  That's how they compromise you.
[02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:21.372]  And they're all little kids.
[02:08:21.372 --> 02:08:22.593]  They're all little kids.
[02:08:22.593 --> 02:08:24.073]  Like, people call me up and they go,
[02:08:25.174 --> 02:08:28.116]  Yeah, we're probably, you're not going to be living long if you don't turn against Trump.
[02:08:28.116 --> 02:08:30.157]  I go, well get ready to go to war.
[02:08:30.157 --> 02:08:31.678]  Or, you know, the games they play.
[02:08:31.678 --> 02:08:33.099]  And then they leave you alone.
[02:08:33.099 --> 02:08:38.023]  People don't get, like, when you start bending over to these wolves, they rape the daylights out of you.
[02:08:38.023 --> 02:08:40.885]  So you don't want to be where everybody's shiny and telling you you're good.
[02:08:40.885 --> 02:08:41.985]  You want to be in the war.
[02:08:41.985 --> 02:08:46.048]  And Candace, you're good looking, you're smart, you're authentic, you're real.
[02:08:46.048 --> 02:08:46.909]  They're scared of you.
[02:08:47.569 --> 02:08:51.592]  And the fact that this shows the disease inside the Trump operation.
[02:08:51.592 --> 02:08:52.733]  And I'm not saying they're all bad.
[02:08:52.733 --> 02:08:53.934]  I don't know who's good and who's bad.
[02:08:53.934 --> 02:08:55.455]  I don't get into inner fights.
[02:08:55.455 --> 02:08:56.676]  I just know this.
[02:08:56.676 --> 02:08:58.617]  This country's getting screwed over.
[02:08:58.617 --> 02:09:01.680]  And the president figured out that the private Federal Reserve was killing the recovery.
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:03.341]  He told them to stop it and they stopped it.
[02:09:03.341 --> 02:09:09.165]  And the damn big tech is raping everybody's rights, openly saying whose name you can say.
[02:09:09.165 --> 02:09:12.608]  It's not just un-American, it's anti-human.
[02:09:12.608 --> 02:09:14.349]  It's Twilight Zone on PCP.
[02:09:15.390 --> 02:09:16.871]  It's crazy town!
[02:09:16.871 --> 02:09:19.372]  And I want action, and I want it now!
[02:09:19.372 --> 02:09:20.212]  Go ahead.
[02:09:20.212 --> 02:09:24.154]  Well, it's really sort of out as Huxley, but even Huxley didn't imagine this kind of world.
[02:09:24.154 --> 02:09:26.155]  It's Orwellian beyond Orwell.
[02:09:26.155 --> 02:09:27.655]  It's basically, it's beyond 1984.
[02:09:27.655 --> 02:09:38.600]  It would be like if you wrote a sequel to Beyond 1984, the first chapter would be they ban the name of a person from being used in the social or public media discourse, or even in their own private conversation.
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:39.941]  Because that's effectively what's happening.
[02:09:39.941 --> 02:09:43.222]  When you're saying that private chat groups, that's what Facebook is doing now.
[02:09:43.522 --> 02:09:53.570]  They're saying you cannot use the name of Alex Jones or InfoWars in private chat groups that just two days ago Zuckerberg promised was going to be private.
[02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:55.571]  And they just think that's going to wear off.
[02:09:55.571 --> 02:09:56.712]  We're not going to accept it.
[02:09:56.712 --> 02:10:00.195]  You put damn robots in our house that watch us and now tell us what we can say!
[02:10:00.675 --> 02:10:01.375]  Completely.
[02:10:01.375 --> 02:10:07.637]  And at some point, well, it goes back to the old Panopticon system that Bentham talked about, that how do you create... Occult.
[02:10:07.637 --> 02:10:08.457]  Exactly.
[02:10:08.457 --> 02:10:12.579]  How do you create a system where people are going to monitor themselves?
[02:10:12.579 --> 02:10:24.142]  When Foucault was doing his entire study of how the prison system and the mental health systems had changed over time, over societies and over history, what he was identifying, and there's a lot of things about Foucault I don't agree with, but here his analysis was excellent.
[02:10:24.142 --> 02:10:30.284]  Yeah, the gay gangbangs run into that, but the whole point is getting into Panopticonic where you surveil yourself, you censor yourself.
[02:10:30.464 --> 02:10:34.087]  Exactly, that's the goal, is to have surveillance trigger self-censorship.
[02:10:34.087 --> 02:10:43.894]  Punishment, an economic punishment of someone's actions that is allowing a civil tort to go forward, or a civil suit to go forward, when they're in ways that are going to self-censor speech.
[02:10:43.894 --> 02:10:46.956]  The whole point of the First Amendment rules is to not allow that to happen.
[02:10:46.956 --> 02:10:54.082]  Here what's happening is they're using surveillance to suppress, using surveillance to censor, but now they're going further, they're being the actual censor.
[02:10:54.082 --> 02:10:55.223]  How would you quantify
[02:10:56.368 --> 02:11:06.096]  This period in history, with the left being so insane, so bullish, their minions being so weak, but they've got so much corporate power, and they're allied with the Chi-Coms and EU.
[02:11:06.096 --> 02:11:16.244]  I mean, they're a formidable force, but they're like a giant rotting Hydra, that as it stumbles forward, it's dying, but more heads grow out of the scrofulous mass.
[02:11:16.244 --> 02:11:21.329]  And then meanwhile, we put up with it, because we're not used to censorship like this, and we still believe we're free.
[02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:23.891]  Well, how would you describe the gestalt?
[02:11:40.603 --> 02:11:41.224]  And so that's it.
[02:11:41.224 --> 02:11:42.005]  That's the dichotomy.
[02:11:42.005 --> 02:11:42.526]  That's the choice.
[02:11:42.526 --> 02:11:43.006]  Absolutely.
[02:11:43.006 --> 02:11:45.349]  And Big Tech is pursuing the Chinese social credit system.
[02:11:45.349 --> 02:11:46.851]  I mean, I guarantee you that China won't.
[02:11:46.851 --> 02:11:49.254]  MasterCard says they're going to watch what you buy.
[02:11:49.254 --> 02:11:50.396]  Not the host.
[02:11:50.396 --> 02:11:52.058]  They're going to watch what you do, buddy.
[02:11:52.058 --> 02:11:52.599]  Not only that.
[02:11:52.599 --> 02:11:54.781]  You might buy a Nazi book to see what they're saying.
[02:11:54.781 --> 02:11:56.804]  You don't agree with it, you're getting hurt.
[02:11:56.804 --> 02:11:57.345]  Absolutely.
[02:11:57.345 --> 02:11:57.946]  That's evil.
[02:11:59.247 --> 02:12:03.911]  Any of you people scared to say, oh, I can't say Alex Jones's name or something bad might happen to me.
[02:12:03.911 --> 02:12:06.933]  I can't say Infowars name or something bad might happen to me.
[02:12:06.933 --> 02:12:18.101]  It's trying to create a culture of self-censorship to where ordinary, everyday people are afraid to talk about what they want to talk about, have their own... A chilling effect, a stifling, but here's the good news.
[02:12:18.101 --> 02:12:20.683]  They failed, failed, failed, failed, failed, failed, failed.
[02:12:20.683 --> 02:12:26.247]  We failed to realize how serious it is to get even more angry, but we have enough of our instincts to where we've kind of halfway gotten up, we're beating them.
[02:12:27.279 --> 02:12:29.940]  So they've just gone to their endgame 20 years from now.
[02:12:29.940 --> 02:12:40.402]  Surveillance and real-time of links, watching everything you do, everyone having to go into a Facebook bedtime story where the police officer asks you all, the Commissar asks all the questions.
[02:12:40.402 --> 02:12:46.724]  They've accelerated to their final black hole destination in a hope that will rook us out of our victory.
[02:12:46.724 --> 02:12:47.784]  I see this as desperation.
[02:12:48.064 --> 02:12:56.467]  Oh, absolutely, because the main thing they underestimated, because of their echo chamber existence, is the two great schools of learning that can never be closed.
[02:12:56.467 --> 02:13:05.350]  Years ago, a great scholar said back during the Dark Ages, so there's two great scholars at the church, the state, nobody can suppress, and those are the archives of nature and the rights of man.
[02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:09.131]  The conscience of ordinary people and their ability to use their own faculty of reason and their own...
[02:13:09.531 --> 02:13:09.611]  Sure.
[02:13:28.353 --> 02:13:29.814]  Trick they're counting on is this.
[02:13:29.814 --> 02:13:38.557]  They hear about bands so long that when the super band comes, people already heard about the earlier bands, they're kind of like, eh, because I would think we'd see massive financial spike in support.
[02:13:38.557 --> 02:13:39.737]  We're not really seeing that right now.
[02:13:39.737 --> 02:13:44.399]  Because people are kind of used to, yeah, old Alex, you know, Godzilla's out there fighting Megalon.
[02:13:44.399 --> 02:13:45.479]  He'll win, don't worry.
[02:13:45.479 --> 02:13:46.379]  No.
[02:13:46.379 --> 02:13:50.941]  Godzilla's like bleeding and like flopping around being bitten by seven-headed monsters.
[02:13:50.941 --> 02:13:52.581]  I need some damn money, OK?
[02:13:52.581 --> 02:13:57.143]  And by the way, one sick part of me wants this to fail and go away and give up, but my guts can't quit.
[02:13:57.683 --> 02:14:00.204]  So I'm just telling you, man, we need some damn money here.
[02:14:00.204 --> 02:14:01.805]  And I'll sell you the best products anyways.
[02:14:01.805 --> 02:14:04.326]  Get in there, buy them, and sign up for AutoShip.
[02:14:04.326 --> 02:14:06.127]  There's a total war, and I don't want to give up.
[02:14:06.127 --> 02:14:07.147]  I can't give up.
[02:14:07.147 --> 02:14:20.933]  And that's the main thing they've underestimated is the power of the ordinary person to use their own faculties of reason and act on their own conscience to do as they see fit, to support whom they want, to back whom they want, to make sure certain voices are heard against the attempts at censorship and suppression.
[02:14:20.933 --> 02:14:21.833]  Bob, I can't believe it.
[02:14:22.073 --> 02:14:23.054]  It's so archetypal.
[02:14:23.054 --> 02:14:25.077]  It's like a cartoon tyranny.
[02:14:25.077 --> 02:14:28.322]  It's so flaming and ridiculous and crazy.
[02:14:28.322 --> 02:14:35.613]  We're going to kill babies after they're born and families are bad and big dudes can compete in women's contests and be all the power lifting champions.
[02:14:35.613 --> 02:14:37.977]  It's like upside down Easter Bunny world.
[02:14:38.337 --> 02:14:40.760]  It's completely, it's Stranger Things on steroids.
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:47.847]  So it's a completely different world and a completely different reality they're trying to create and they really believe because they operate too much in the Hollywood space.
[02:14:47.847 --> 02:14:50.330]  And so I think they really believe... So they're delusional?
[02:14:50.330 --> 02:14:50.930]  Completely.
[02:14:50.930 --> 02:14:52.993]  And they keep trying to project what they want.
[02:14:53.803 --> 02:14:55.163]  And they think they can create their own reality.
[02:14:55.163 --> 02:14:59.044]  They think they can script their own story, no matter how insane, no matter how crazy, no matter how lunatic.
[02:14:59.044 --> 02:15:02.785]  So, I mean, half of them think they actually are living in a simulation.
[02:15:02.785 --> 02:15:08.726]  And so they want to make us, that shows how crazy Silicon Valley is, they want to make us comport as NPCs.
[02:15:08.726 --> 02:15:09.026]  Precisely.
[02:15:09.026 --> 02:15:17.888]  They want to make us, it's just like Tron, the original Tron, the master program, you're going to join me, and it's like... I mean, these are people who grew up on Tron, who really think, oh,
[02:15:18.228 --> 02:15:26.670]  Rather than looking at Tron or Orwell or Huxley as a dangerous thing to be afraid of, to fear, to want to resist, they saw them as things to embrace and emulate.
[02:15:26.670 --> 02:15:27.030]  Exactly.
[02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:28.271]  Let me use a Tron analogy.
[02:15:28.271 --> 02:15:32.032]  Like when the main system says, all my systems are yours.
[02:15:32.032 --> 02:15:33.392]  That's the systems all in.
[02:15:33.392 --> 02:15:34.872]  I need your systems.
[02:15:34.872 --> 02:15:35.913]  And that doesn't mean to enslave you.
[02:15:35.913 --> 02:15:37.613]  I just need your prayers and financial support.
[02:15:37.613 --> 02:15:39.914]  Because, like, I'll grow 100 feet tall and take these guys on.
[02:15:39.914 --> 02:15:44.895]  But, I mean, that's literally, when you give us money and you spread the word, I get stronger, they get weaker.
[02:15:45.916 --> 02:15:47.377]  I need your will.
[02:15:47.377 --> 02:15:49.460]  I need you to support me.
[02:15:49.460 --> 02:15:50.681]  I need it now!
[02:15:55.635 --> 02:16:00.697]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[02:16:26.457 --> 02:16:30.358]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.358 --> 02:16:31.899]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:31.899 --> 02:16:34.860]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:40.422]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:16:54.748 --> 02:17:01.112]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:01.112 --> 02:17:04.154]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:04.154 --> 02:17:10.078]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:10.078 --> 02:17:13.861]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:13.861 --> 02:17:15.122]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:15.122 --> 02:17:16.483]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:16.483 --> 02:17:22.687]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[02:19:59.580 --> 02:20:02.262]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:25.856 --> 02:20:26.877]  Alex Jones here.
[02:20:26.877 --> 02:20:27.757]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:20:27.757 --> 02:20:32.881]  We have another guest coming on with Robert Barnes.
[02:20:32.881 --> 02:20:38.105]  That's the Attorney General with Robert Barnes riding shotgun with us.
[02:20:38.105 --> 02:20:40.547]  And we also have a journalist that heads up human events.
[02:20:42.156 --> 02:20:45.078]  Raheem Kassam joining us to get into all this censorship.
[02:20:45.078 --> 02:20:50.503]  But I actually feel like I'm doing a terrible job today, even though the show, people say, is really informative and powerful.
[02:20:50.503 --> 02:20:58.149]  The magnitude of CNN saying, yeah, we just banned all these people, and we're going to now ban them having text messages or phone calls.
[02:20:59.386 --> 02:21:26.102]  And we're now in their phones looking at it, and he's trying to fight, not smiling, just the demoniac, criminal energy, the anti-Americanism, the clawing desire to shut down competition with CNN with almost no viewers, dwarfing them, but they have the huge intelligence agency funding, CNN is state-run media, and Trump has not stopped Obama and Hillary, who still control much of the government.
[02:21:26.562 --> 02:21:27.163]  Well, you have Darcy.
[02:21:27.163 --> 02:21:30.966]  I mean, Darcy's actually up on Twitter today complaining because Donald Trump Jr.
[02:21:30.966 --> 02:21:41.175]  also tweeted out that this is a dangerous threat, an imminent threat, that the banning of you, the banning of Infowars, that this banning is escalating to a whole new level and everybody else is next.
[02:21:41.175 --> 02:21:44.198]  And so Darcy responded, oh no, no, but these are radicals.
[02:21:44.198 --> 02:21:45.659]  Radicals, whatever that means.
[02:21:45.659 --> 02:21:49.842]  Well, Darcy's a radical against the free speech of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
[02:21:49.842 --> 02:21:52.405]  He's the high priest of killing America.
[02:21:52.865 --> 02:21:58.351]  I mean, he's a guy who does not believe in free speech, does not believe in free press, does not believe in free thought, does not believe in free debate.
[02:21:58.351 --> 02:22:03.217]  He's a greater threat to the fundamental values of American liberty in terms of his activities than anyone else.
[02:22:03.217 --> 02:22:07.302]  And I believe he has the full, complete right to participate in the public square.
[02:22:07.722 --> 02:22:09.724]  He has a right to say get rid of free speech.
[02:22:09.724 --> 02:22:11.845]  And then he runs around foaming at the mouth.
[02:22:11.845 --> 02:22:13.567]  You know, let's play the whole piece.
[02:22:13.567 --> 02:22:17.530]  This is him yesterday looking like he's just having an orgasm every five seconds.
[02:22:17.530 --> 02:22:18.531]  He's sweating.
[02:22:18.531 --> 02:22:20.372]  His eyes are bulging out.
[02:22:20.372 --> 02:22:21.693]  He's finally somebody.
[02:22:21.693 --> 02:22:23.354]  He's suppressing people.
[02:22:23.354 --> 02:22:24.135]  He's involved.
[02:22:24.135 --> 02:22:25.096]  He's coordinating this.
[02:22:25.096 --> 02:22:26.817]  He's a big man.
[02:22:26.817 --> 02:22:28.538]  He's going to shut Americans up.
[02:22:28.538 --> 02:22:29.719]  He's going to teach them.
[02:22:29.719 --> 02:22:30.120]  Here it is.
[02:22:32.842 --> 02:22:37.644]  Just into CNN, Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platforms.
[02:22:37.644 --> 02:22:45.487]  Among them, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, as well as his media outlet InfoWars.
[02:22:45.487 --> 02:22:49.729]  They're being banned for spreading, quote, dangerous ideology.
[02:22:49.729 --> 02:22:53.051]  CNN Business Senior Media Reporter Oliver Darcy joins me now.
[02:22:53.051 --> 02:22:55.852]  So what more do we know about this ban and who else is included?
[02:22:56.485 --> 02:22:59.767]  Yeah, this is a very strict action from Facebook, Erica.
[02:22:59.767 --> 02:23:03.790]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous, is what Facebook is saying.
[02:23:03.790 --> 02:23:15.837]  Those individuals include Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who has a history of anti-Semitic remarks, people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, and then also some right-wing media personalities who are pretty popular online.
[02:23:15.837 --> 02:23:20.340]  People like Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, Paul Joseph Watson, those people are banned.
[02:23:20.620 --> 02:23:25.602]  As well as a failed congressional candidate, Paul Nyland, who had made a number of anti-Semitic remarks.
[02:23:25.602 --> 02:23:33.484]  Facebook has given us a statement, and they do say in their statement, I'll read part of it to you right now, they say that we... Well, hold your pause.
[02:23:33.484 --> 02:23:35.905]  Again, Ilhan Omar, all of them say stuff way worse than that.
[02:23:35.905 --> 02:23:37.445]  I say that because they have a right to say it.
[02:23:37.445 --> 02:23:45.708]  But the way CNN and them ignore it, and then ban Laura Loomer for criticizing Ilhan Omar's anti-Semitic comments, and then say she's an anti-Semite...
[02:23:46.388 --> 02:23:48.830]  The brazen lies!
[02:23:48.830 --> 02:23:51.052]  It's so bizarre!
[02:23:51.052 --> 02:23:54.355]  They want to be able to have the sole platform.
[02:23:54.355 --> 02:24:03.363]  I mean, it's very much taking the safe space ideology that took off on college campuses over the past half decade and making it the ideology across the board.
[02:24:03.363 --> 02:24:05.545]  And he's saying, you will watch me!
[02:24:05.545 --> 02:24:05.925]  I am God!
[02:24:07.886 --> 02:24:09.567]  How do they get so pretentious?
[02:24:09.567 --> 02:24:13.749]  Like, what is the gene to think you're in charge, everyone must do what you say?
[02:24:13.749 --> 02:24:27.574]  It's an ideology that they've grown up with of the way the academy and the public schools and universities have been teaching people is not to defend and be a guardian of free speech, free thought and free ideas, but to be a guardian of the right thought and to prohibit wrong think.
[02:24:27.574 --> 02:24:28.554]  And that's their mentality.
[02:24:28.554 --> 02:24:33.336]  They think they are the guardians, the special guardians chosen to make sure that only the right ideas are accepted.
[02:24:33.336 --> 02:24:34.516]  They're the intellectuals.
[02:24:34.516 --> 02:24:34.876]  Exactly.
[02:24:34.876 --> 02:24:35.717]  Let's finish up with the club.
[02:24:35.717 --> 02:24:35.997]  Here it is.
[02:24:37.565 --> 02:24:39.727]  I'll read part of it to you right now.
[02:24:39.727 --> 02:24:43.190]  They say that we've always banned individuals or organizations... Oh, we've always!
[02:24:43.190 --> 02:24:44.571]  That's a complete lie.
[02:24:44.571 --> 02:24:52.357]  Regardless of ideology, the process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.
[02:24:52.357 --> 02:24:57.502]  Facebook told me that the process they use is to engage a number of factors.
[02:24:57.502 --> 02:25:00.504]  Have they promoted hate speech on Facebook?
[02:25:00.504 --> 02:25:02.926]  Have they been banned for violating the rules in the past?
[02:25:03.106 --> 02:25:07.647]  Have they self-described themselves as part of a hate movement or hate ideology?
[02:25:07.647 --> 02:25:12.749]  Those are the factors that Facebook was weighing, and, you know, they're taking this really strict action moments ago.
[02:25:12.749 --> 02:25:13.389]  Pause again.
[02:25:13.389 --> 02:25:20.211]  We've had a secret star chamber, and we just say so, and I've got bug eyes like Cookie Monster, so it's okay.
[02:25:20.211 --> 02:25:23.632]  And then now he says they shouldn't be able to use telephones.
[02:25:23.632 --> 02:25:25.233]  That's right, text messages.
[02:25:25.233 --> 02:25:25.613]  It's coming.
[02:25:27.427 --> 02:25:29.588]  And banning him from Facebook and Instagram, correct?
[02:25:29.588 --> 02:25:46.214]  Yes, Facebook obviously owns Instagram, and so someone like Alex Jones had been banned from Facebook a while back, last year in the summer, but he was still having a presence on Instagram, and that had drawn a lot of scrutiny from people who were saying, hey, you know, you guys banned him from one of your platforms, why are you allowing him to have a presence on Instagram?
[02:25:46.214 --> 02:25:54.237]  And so, yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[02:25:54.757 --> 02:25:59.800]  I checked in also to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook.
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:07.344]  And a spokesperson cannot say immediately because it's, I guess, unclear whether some of these people have WhatsApp accounts, according to the spokesperson.
[02:26:07.344 --> 02:26:09.225]  So they own thousands of companies.
[02:26:09.225 --> 02:26:12.227]  I guess they buy my water company.
[02:26:12.227 --> 02:26:14.908]  We're checking to see if he's getting water from Facebook.
[02:26:14.908 --> 02:26:16.549]  We turned his water off.
[02:26:16.549 --> 02:26:18.050]  We own the oxygen now.
[02:26:18.050 --> 02:26:19.831]  We're seeing if he got the oxygen from us.
[02:26:20.191 --> 02:26:23.876]  Well, knowing that, Facebook's announcing today that they plan on exploring cryptocurrency.
[02:26:23.876 --> 02:26:26.158]  That they want to have their own currency.
[02:26:26.158 --> 02:26:27.901]  And so, ultimately, they would control everything.
[02:26:27.901 --> 02:26:32.286]  They would control your ability to buy anything, to sell anything, to receive anything, all of it.
[02:26:32.286 --> 02:26:34.088]  They would have complete monopoly.
[02:26:34.088 --> 02:26:36.031]  And Oliver Dossi will decide.
[02:26:36.491 --> 02:26:38.393]  Well, I love the way he said he checked in.
[02:26:38.393 --> 02:26:39.374]  Checked in, right?
[02:26:39.374 --> 02:26:44.318]  And not, I made a investigative inquiry and called someone.
[02:26:44.318 --> 02:26:48.101]  I checked in, as if he was complicit and part of the system.
[02:26:48.101 --> 02:26:49.222]  That's an interesting choice.
[02:26:49.222 --> 02:27:00.672]  Although they have a whole system under the Countering Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act, run by the CIA, with the media recruiting everyone with interfaces and 70,000 Southern Poverty Law Center-trained SJWs.
[02:27:00.672 --> 02:27:01.433]  That's their new job.
[02:27:01.673 --> 02:27:05.896]  We've had former employees here that go, that's the jobs they get, they become leftists.
[02:27:05.896 --> 02:27:12.339]  They go have little terminal jobs, and they're in your email, your photos, it's like, oh, we write everything, oh, so liberal.
[02:27:12.339 --> 02:27:13.260]  Yeah, I mean, it's amazing.
[02:27:13.260 --> 02:27:14.981]  They're Stasi agents.
[02:27:14.981 --> 02:27:15.461]  Absolutely.
[02:27:15.461 --> 02:27:18.723]  I mean, it's what ultimately drove- They try to come to our events, our meetings, and spy on us.
[02:27:18.723 --> 02:27:20.284]  It's just like, God, you're pathetic.
[02:27:20.404 --> 02:27:22.486]  We'll just show the degree of coordination.
[02:27:22.486 --> 02:27:24.048]  It's the real collusion that's taking place.
[02:27:24.048 --> 02:27:43.048]  The real collusion is between big media and big tech to silence and suppress both competitors and conservatives and independent dissident voices that are on the populist side of the political spectrum, that helped elect President Trump, that helped elect Bolsonaro in Brazil, that helped elect people all across the world in the populist movement that's spreading literally across the world.
[02:27:43.428 --> 02:27:51.910]  And they're doing so in order to be able to not only coordinate and control what happens, I mean, this is real collusion, this is real, as Paul referred to it, real election meddling.
[02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:57.691]  Unlike, you know, a few Facebook ads that nobody ever saw, read, or reviewed, and when they did this, found them funny and weird.
[02:27:57.691 --> 02:28:04.052]  This is actual attempts to coordinate and to manipulate the election results by not allowing you to hear the independent voices.
[02:28:04.052 --> 02:28:06.092]  You are totally correct, Mr. Barnes.
[02:28:06.092 --> 02:28:09.893]  We come back, we've got the, they've relaunched Human Events, which is always a great publication.
[02:28:10.453 --> 02:28:13.234]  Raheem Kassam is going to join us about free speech and where this is going.
[02:28:13.234 --> 02:28:14.675]  We'll open the phones up tomorrow.
[02:28:14.675 --> 02:28:17.076]  I'll be back Saturday with a special emergency report.
[02:28:17.076 --> 02:28:20.838]  I don't know what time, but it'll be the afternoon and the regular Sunday show 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:28:20.838 --> 02:28:26.241]  But we're going to come back and get to all this because folks, this is unprecedented.
[02:28:26.241 --> 02:28:33.284]  They don't want us to physically get upset about this and understand how bad it is to say you're not going to use text messages.
[02:28:33.284 --> 02:28:34.445]  We're watching what you say and do.
[02:28:35.545 --> 02:28:38.829]  And we're, and we're buying up your telecoms, we're listening to your messages.
[02:28:38.829 --> 02:28:45.515]  This is the NSA leftist movement rolling out, getting you to opt into their systems and then surveilling you.
[02:28:45.515 --> 02:28:47.437]  This is criminal activity.
[02:28:47.437 --> 02:28:51.421]  This is them saying, you will not say the name Alex Jones.
[02:28:51.421 --> 02:28:53.363]  Think about that in a science fiction movie.
[02:28:53.363 --> 02:28:53.924]  It's incredible.
[02:28:55.034 --> 02:28:56.936]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:28:56.936 --> 02:29:00.158]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[02:29:00.158 --> 02:29:01.759]  Savory and delicious.
[02:29:01.759 --> 02:29:04.602]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[02:29:04.602 --> 02:29:05.262]  Awesome!
[02:29:05.262 --> 02:29:08.345]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[02:29:08.345 --> 02:29:09.906]  NASA PAC Technology.
[02:29:09.906 --> 02:29:10.527]  Bacon.
[02:29:10.527 --> 02:29:14.690]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:16.131]  Or warm and served.
[02:29:16.131 --> 02:29:18.173]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:29:18.173 --> 02:29:20.114]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[02:30:57.113 --> 02:30:58.513]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:30:58.513 --> 02:31:00.414]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:31:00.414 --> 02:31:01.034]  It is.
[02:31:01.034 --> 02:31:05.915]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:31:05.915 --> 02:31:07.255]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:31:07.255 --> 02:31:09.016]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:31:09.016 --> 02:31:11.556]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[02:31:11.556 --> 02:31:13.197]  Brain, body, heart.
[02:31:13.197 --> 02:31:14.637]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[02:31:14.637 --> 02:31:16.017]  You've got the children's.

[02:31:17.138 --> 02:31:18.138]  You've got the krill oil.
[02:31:18.138 --> 02:31:21.519]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[02:31:21.519 --> 02:31:23.279]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the
[02:31:23.439 --> 02:31:24.540]  We're good to go.
[02:31:47.366 --> 02:31:53.393]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:31:53.393 --> 02:31:54.134]  I just can't do it!

[02:32:59.143 --> 02:33:01.965]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:20.214 --> 02:33:25.145]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:53.934 --> 02:33:55.717]  Well, we've been seduced by the big tech.
[02:33:55.717 --> 02:33:59.081]  We're getting ahead of human events on a relaunched important conservative newspaper.
[02:33:59.081 --> 02:34:02.486]  Robert Barnes riding shotgun here, constitutional lawyer.
[02:34:02.486 --> 02:34:03.467]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:34:06.653 --> 02:34:20.067]  This is so reckless, so brazen, so naked, so crazy, so over the top, but I guess we've been acquiescing so long that we've allowed this type of extreme behavior by our acquiescence.
[02:34:20.067 --> 02:34:28.515]  What comes next if we submit to them live time in our text messages, in our phone calls, and banning words we can use?
[02:34:28.515 --> 02:34:29.536]  I mean, what comes next?
[02:34:29.636 --> 02:34:30.456]  Well that's what's going to happen.
[02:34:30.456 --> 02:34:41.420]  So something will be a trending topic and they'll use AI if it's a trending topic that favors the political right or favors the independent left or favors the independent political press or challenges any institutional or established narrative.
[02:34:41.420 --> 02:34:41.880]  Bam!
[02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:42.720]  Just ban it.
[02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:43.320]  Suppress it.
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:46.802]  And maybe only do it for 24 hours or 48 hours over a critical time period.
[02:34:46.802 --> 02:34:47.882]  But that effectively would do it.
[02:34:47.882 --> 02:34:52.944]  They actually tested this in the French elections when they wanted to make sure Le Pen lost.
[02:34:52.944 --> 02:34:56.645]  But for 48 hours they banned certain kind of activities on social media.
[02:34:56.645 --> 02:34:57.105]  And they saw the
[02:34:57.185 --> 02:34:57.625]  No, you won't!
[02:34:57.625 --> 02:34:58.486]  Get rid of it!
[02:34:58.486 --> 02:34:58.786]  Stop it!
[02:35:18.954 --> 02:35:19.414]  Precisely.
[02:35:19.414 --> 02:35:24.277]  It's a direct threat to the core foundational fundamental freedoms of the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[02:35:24.277 --> 02:35:35.244]  So if you go back to Rhode Island, where all of my Barnes family members are from back in the time of the Constitution, you go and you look at the old voting rolls, and you say they all voted no against the Constitution because it did not yet include the Bill of Rights.
[02:35:35.244 --> 02:35:37.485]  They would only approve of it once it had the Bill of Rights in it.
[02:35:37.785 --> 02:35:48.091]  And the very first amendment, the very first part of that first Bill of Rights is that no law can pass or nothing should happen in civil society that abridges the freedom of press or freedom of speech.
[02:35:48.091 --> 02:35:49.712]  So what is it in individuals?
[02:35:49.712 --> 02:35:55.496]  Because I've found powerful, smart, cool people always believe in free speech because they're so confident.
[02:35:55.496 --> 02:35:58.898]  There's always kind of weird technocrat serpent people that don't.
[02:35:58.898 --> 02:36:01.759]  And there's kind of dumbed down folks that don't agree on speech either.
[02:36:01.759 --> 02:36:04.741]  But I just don't get why other people don't value it.
[02:36:04.741 --> 02:36:06.342]  It obviously creates a better civilization.
[02:36:06.522 --> 02:36:13.367]  What's happened, I think there's a lot of good professors in sociology and other areas who have described it, it's basically a safe space culture.
[02:36:13.367 --> 02:36:20.571]  That due to the media overreacting to kidnapping stories in the 80s and the 90s, what happened was an entire generation... We're wimps now.
[02:36:20.571 --> 02:36:21.032]  Absolutely.
[02:36:21.032 --> 02:36:27.676]  And now even lawyers that are suing us and saying horrible things about me, they're like, but you can't talk about me, you're making me not safe.
[02:36:27.676 --> 02:36:28.957]  We're not saying anything violent to them.
[02:36:28.957 --> 02:36:30.598]  That's the entitlement.
[02:36:30.598 --> 02:36:33.960]  I'm going to sue you and destroy you, and you don't say I'm a bad person.
[02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:34.921]  You take it!
[02:36:34.921 --> 02:36:36.302]  I'm in a safe space!
[02:36:36.562 --> 02:36:42.544]  The entire safe space culture has embraced that.
[02:36:42.544 --> 02:36:49.386]  You can be a lawyer, have a different point of view, a different perspective, and nobody wants anything bad to happen to anybody out there, period.
[02:36:49.386 --> 02:36:51.606]  That's a big story out right now.
[02:36:51.606 --> 02:36:54.807]  How dare Alex Jones' lawyer fight back?
[02:36:54.807 --> 02:36:56.348]  He needs to be banned!
[02:36:56.348 --> 02:36:58.908]  Do you believe people think they get oxygen next?
[02:36:58.908 --> 02:36:59.208]  Exactly.
[02:36:59.208 --> 02:37:05.170]  You have Daily Beast and other people out there promoting the idea that I should not be allowed to defend you in the public arena.
[02:37:05.430 --> 02:37:07.732]  I should not be allowed to defend you in the court of public opinion.
[02:37:07.732 --> 02:37:11.576]  I should not be allowed to speak my own state of mind, my own point of view on this.
[02:37:11.576 --> 02:37:15.620]  Because I've been speaking about this- Well, they run around like rabid dogs attacking us.
[02:37:15.620 --> 02:37:17.121]  Oh, no, I mean all kinds of attacks.
[02:37:17.121 --> 02:37:21.926]  Attacks coming all over the place from the institutional press and from powerful politicians.
[02:37:21.926 --> 02:37:28.092]  When you have someone like Senator Murphy going on Meet the Press to say you should be banned from being- To save America!
[02:37:28.092 --> 02:37:28.753]  Exactly.
[02:37:29.193 --> 02:37:31.695]  Which is, I mean, the degree of double deception there.
[02:37:31.695 --> 02:37:34.077]  You cannot save America by banning anyone's speech.
[02:37:34.077 --> 02:37:36.019]  You kill America by banning anyone's speech.
[02:37:36.019 --> 02:37:41.484]  Let's bring in Raheem Kassam, great researcher, great journalist.
[02:37:41.484 --> 02:37:44.907]  He's been on the show before, at Raheem Kassam for Now on Twitter.
[02:37:44.907 --> 02:37:47.048]  They've relaunched a Human Events.
[02:37:47.048 --> 02:37:49.470]  I was in high school and had my job
[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:57.962]  at the golf course after hours and I remember ordering human events and it came, I guess, every week or something in the mailbox.
[02:37:57.962 --> 02:37:59.062]  But they've relaunched it.
[02:37:59.062 --> 02:37:59.883]  Congratulations on that.
[02:37:59.883 --> 02:38:00.683]  We'll talk about it.
[02:38:00.683 --> 02:38:03.884]  But what do you make of this, the mass censorship?
[02:38:03.884 --> 02:38:06.184]  Because, again, we have the smoking gun, my friend.
[02:38:06.184 --> 02:38:10.325]  We have a month ago, I hope you'll write about this, them saying, we studied Jones, I think anti-Semitic.
[02:38:10.325 --> 02:38:12.906]  Well, even if it is anti-Semitic, we have a free speech, but I didn't.
[02:38:12.906 --> 02:38:14.627]  Then they still run with this ban.
[02:38:14.627 --> 02:38:15.307]  Laura Loomer,
[02:38:16.147 --> 02:38:25.834]  And Milo Yiannopoulos, who happens to be Jewish, and me, mix in Farrakhan to make it look reasonable, and then just go ahead with the defamation and then say you can't say Alex Jones's name.
[02:38:25.834 --> 02:38:27.415]  What are you?
[02:38:27.415 --> 02:38:29.336]  I mean, maybe this is a simulation.
[02:38:29.336 --> 02:38:32.898]  We're playing the 1984 game on steroids?
[02:38:32.898 --> 02:38:33.559]  I mean, what is this?
[02:38:34.639 --> 02:38:44.426]  You know, whenever people have made historical comparisons to 1984, I've typically balked because it tends to be a little bit trite and it tends to be a little bit shoehorned in.
[02:38:44.426 --> 02:38:58.195]  But the fact of the matter is, when people are posting pictures, a picture of you, a picture of Milo, a picture of Laura, just pictures, not saying anything to their Instagram accounts, those pictures are being blurred and removed today.
[02:38:58.195 --> 02:39:03.718]  If that's not the memory hole, if that's not Winston Smith's memory hole from Orwell's 1984, then I don't know what is.
[02:39:04.659 --> 02:39:05.340]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:39:05.340 --> 02:39:09.543]  Tell us about this as a journalist, because I got thousands, I say thousands, hundreds are coming in an hour.
[02:39:09.543 --> 02:39:11.884]  People saying, I try to even say your name, it's banned.
[02:39:11.884 --> 02:39:14.947]  It's not just on Facebook, it's happening everywhere on these big platforms.
[02:39:14.947 --> 02:39:17.689]  You're saying they're blurring images of us now.
[02:39:18.817 --> 02:39:20.579]  Yeah, that's absolutely right.
[02:39:20.579 --> 02:39:38.919]  A friend of mine was showing me pictures earlier where she was trying to post pictures of her friends with you guys, whether it was in, you know, the Trump Hotel in Washington DC or CPAC or whatever it was, and the pictures were being blurred and removed and they were getting a notification that said this has to come down off your page now or you'll be banned as well.
[02:39:39.019 --> 02:39:39.399]  Wow!
[02:39:39.399 --> 02:39:43.902]  So even people that take a picture in public, that, oh my God!
[02:39:43.902 --> 02:39:44.683]  Wow!
[02:39:44.683 --> 02:39:46.704]  And Trump doesn't take action on that!
[02:39:46.704 --> 02:39:50.086]  A private citizen can't put up a, wow!
[02:39:50.086 --> 02:39:50.507]  There it is!
[02:39:51.587 --> 02:39:53.548]  You know, and that's what you've got on the screen there now.
[02:39:53.548 --> 02:39:56.290]  It's exactly what I'm talking about.
[02:39:56.290 --> 02:40:05.256]  This is now gone from the position of, you know, these boomer conservatives saying, oh yeah, but these are private platforms, they can do whatever they want.
[02:40:05.256 --> 02:40:08.118]  What they're actually doing now is erasing you people.
[02:40:08.118 --> 02:40:10.300]  They are trying to erase all of us.
[02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:14.423]  This is the Soviet airbrushing and it shows the surveillance that's going on.
[02:40:14.423 --> 02:40:16.204]  Like, they're surveilling everything you do.
[02:40:17.017 --> 02:40:18.377]  And it's not algorithmic.
[02:40:18.377 --> 02:40:19.658]  It cannot be algorithmic.
[02:40:19.658 --> 02:40:29.019]  So you know there are armies of people in there now looking for your face, Alex, on the internet in order so they can censor you.
[02:40:29.019 --> 02:40:35.521]  I got an email from Facebook yesterday saying, we looked through your page and this post from 11 years ago constitutes hate speech.
[02:40:35.521 --> 02:40:38.201]  Well, no algorithm is picking up something from 11 years ago.
[02:40:38.201 --> 02:40:42.282]  That means somebody is sitting there scrolling through my page 11 years ago.
[02:40:42.282 --> 02:40:43.822]  How many people have they hired?
[02:40:43.822 --> 02:40:46.403]  I heard it's 70,000 between the four companies.
[02:40:47.358 --> 02:40:49.799]  Yeah, it's much more than that.
[02:40:49.799 --> 02:40:52.381]  It's going to be 70,000 here in the United States.
[02:40:52.381 --> 02:40:55.282]  You're going to have many, many more people across Europe.
[02:40:55.282 --> 02:41:00.425]  And of course, don't forget, they've got all the bureaucrats and apparatchiks in the European Union helping them with all of this as well.
[02:41:00.425 --> 02:41:02.166]  This is a state-corporate nexus.
[02:41:02.166 --> 02:41:06.828]  And I have to say, if President Trump doesn't do something about this, this will be his greatest failure as president.
[02:41:07.148 --> 02:41:10.832]  This is his supporters that are coming under attack daily, routinely.
[02:41:10.832 --> 02:41:17.198]  And it's not just so that you can't make as much money as you were making before, Alex, or that I can't monetize my platforms.
[02:41:17.198 --> 02:41:19.300]  This is about erasing us from existence.
[02:41:19.300 --> 02:41:21.962]  Wow, it's not just my face.
[02:41:21.962 --> 02:41:23.084]  Now my image.
[02:41:24.565 --> 02:41:25.165]  Exactly.
[02:41:25.165 --> 02:41:27.427]  Your name, image, nothing that's connected.
[02:41:27.427 --> 02:41:29.188]  It's like you're being un-person.
[02:41:29.188 --> 02:41:32.051]  It is the memory hole that Rahim is talking about.
[02:41:32.051 --> 02:41:33.111]  Stick a fork in me.
[02:41:33.111 --> 02:41:34.733]  I'm not giving up at this point.
[02:41:34.733 --> 02:41:38.996]  I'm just like, I can't believe Rahim that they found this many evil people.
[02:41:38.996 --> 02:41:40.397]  What the hell happened here?
[02:41:42.256 --> 02:41:48.640]  Well, I suspect Facebook especially knows that fewer and fewer people are losing its platform.
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:52.122]  And what do you do when you're trying to hold on to something in the palm of your hand?
[02:41:52.122 --> 02:41:57.365]  You hold it up like this, but if you feel like you're losing grip, you clutch your fist around like that.
[02:41:57.365 --> 02:42:03.208]  Well, what they're doing is they're losing the grains of sand between their fingertips, and they know more and more that they're losing power.
[02:42:03.208 --> 02:42:06.030]  And so that's why, like a wounded animal, they're latching out now.
[02:42:07.028 --> 02:42:07.708]  Well, you're a smart guy.
[02:42:07.708 --> 02:42:08.689]  I remember when you came on before.
[02:42:08.689 --> 02:42:09.509]  We've got to get you on routinely.
[02:42:09.509 --> 02:42:10.949]  I'm glad you relaunched Human Events.
[02:42:10.949 --> 02:42:12.990]  We'll do a few more segments with you and Bob.
[02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:13.970]  And then Owen's taking over.
[02:42:13.970 --> 02:42:14.831]  He'll keep riding the shotgun.
[02:42:14.831 --> 02:42:15.151]  That's fine.
[02:42:15.151 --> 02:42:18.432]  I've got to take my younger daughter to the doctor with a middle daughter, so I've got to leave.
[02:42:18.432 --> 02:42:19.272]  I'm coming back today.
[02:42:19.272 --> 02:42:20.613]  We're going to do a lot today.
[02:42:20.613 --> 02:42:21.093]  But it's just...
[02:42:23.192 --> 02:42:24.473]  I'm not even freaked out anymore.
[02:42:24.473 --> 02:42:27.814]  I'm like, in a Twilight Zone episode, I've never felt like this.
[02:42:27.814 --> 02:42:31.835]  It's just like, and then he, and then they'll tell me, oh, you don't know what's all over the news?
[02:42:31.835 --> 02:42:33.235]  They're banning your picture?
[02:42:33.235 --> 02:42:35.396]  My image?
[02:42:35.396 --> 02:42:37.117]  It's living 1984 in real time.
[02:42:37.117 --> 02:42:38.117]  It's really beyond 1984.
[02:42:38.117 --> 02:42:39.197]  It's a sequel.
[02:42:39.197 --> 02:42:42.098]  It involves things that even Orwell never predicted or forecast.
[02:42:42.098 --> 02:42:44.399]  I mean, aspects of this are extraordinary.
[02:42:44.399 --> 02:42:46.120]  Let me ask both of you as we come back.
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:48.080]  What have they got next in store?
[02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:49.461]  Because you know they've got something more.
[02:42:49.461 --> 02:42:52.022]  I guess it's like arresting us and killing us or something?
[02:42:53.578 --> 02:42:54.839]  Well, they just don't exist.
[02:42:54.839 --> 02:42:54.959]  Yeah.
[02:43:10.749 --> 02:43:17.094]  And when you get a bottle of it at 25% off, you get a free bottle of what is our total bestseller.
[02:43:17.094 --> 02:43:21.158]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.
[02:43:21.158 --> 02:43:23.860]  And that, of course, is knockout, the ultimate sleep aid.

[02:43:55.162 --> 02:44:08.590]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[02:44:08.590 --> 02:44:19.637]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[02:44:20.951 --> 02:44:22.858]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[02:44:22.858 --> 02:44:25.547]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[02:44:26.903 --> 02:44:31.244]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[02:44:31.244 --> 02:44:35.485]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[02:44:35.485 --> 02:44:37.766]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[02:44:37.766 --> 02:44:40.086]  This country is in a war!
[02:44:40.086 --> 02:44:50.789]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[02:44:50.789 --> 02:44:54.370]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[02:44:56.980 --> 02:45:04.324]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[02:45:04.324 --> 02:45:07.426]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.

[02:45:09.027 --> 02:45:11.728]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[02:45:11.728 --> 02:45:13.209]  You're our only sponsors.
[02:45:13.209 --> 02:45:19.693]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[02:45:19.693 --> 02:45:22.194]  So remember, you are the InfoWar.
[02:45:22.194 --> 02:45:23.995]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.
[02:45:23.995 --> 02:45:25.576]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[02:45:25.976 --> 02:45:31.360]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com that are unprecedented.
[02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:39.107]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[02:45:39.107 --> 02:45:41.949]  So I want to thank you for your support, and I want to encourage you again.
[02:45:41.949 --> 02:45:46.853]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.

[02:46:59.122 --> 02:47:01.725]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:17.059 --> 02:47:25.607]  Well, I'm really glad to hear that Human Events, which is a great newspaper, has been re-launched by Raheem Kassam and others in D.C.
[02:47:25.607 --> 02:47:26.648]  Robert Barnes is driving a shotgun.
[02:47:26.648 --> 02:47:28.450]  Well, this is going to the next hour.
[02:47:28.450 --> 02:47:30.372]  We've got Owen Shorter coming in here.
[02:47:30.372 --> 02:47:32.534]  I'm taking my middle daughter to the doctor.
[02:47:32.534 --> 02:47:33.174]  Even though the media
[02:47:34.454 --> 02:47:36.135]  He says that I had my children taken two years ago.
[02:47:36.135 --> 02:47:37.535]  I have my children 90% of the time.
[02:47:37.535 --> 02:47:38.835]  I have primary custody.
[02:47:38.835 --> 02:47:39.295]  Doesn't matter.
[02:47:39.295 --> 02:47:40.336]  They just sat around and had my children.
[02:47:40.336 --> 02:47:42.656]  People go on the street, F you, you don't have your kids.
[02:47:42.656 --> 02:47:46.297]  I'll be on airplanes with my kids coming back from a ski resort or wherever.
[02:47:46.297 --> 02:47:48.818]  They go, F you and your family and you don't have your kids.
[02:47:48.818 --> 02:47:50.139]  And I'm like, okay.
[02:47:50.139 --> 02:47:53.019]  Again, it's just all this fake news that we're this incompetence.
[02:47:53.019 --> 02:47:53.640]  We're failing.
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:54.460]  They're winning.
[02:47:54.460 --> 02:47:57.381]  No, the globalists are losing.
[02:47:57.381 --> 02:48:01.582]  I think we're winning, but I don't want to even just bash Trump for no reason, but
[02:48:02.714 --> 02:48:10.976]  The censorship, the racketeering, the coordination of it, of the now saying you can't say somebody's name and we're surveilling you in live time.
[02:48:10.976 --> 02:48:13.497]  Rahim, you're a smart cookie.
[02:48:13.497 --> 02:48:14.937]  You're up there in DC.
[02:48:14.937 --> 02:48:19.498]  What do you think is going on currently and where do you think this is going to go if Trump doesn't take action?
[02:48:19.498 --> 02:48:21.259]  And what action do you think Trump should take?
[02:48:22.378 --> 02:48:37.510]  Look, here's why I think they've done it to you guys now, because you've been the tip of the spear in terms of not just the support for President Trump, but your support for constitutional principles, support for libertarian, conservative, nationalist principles, all of those over the course of the years.
[02:48:37.510 --> 02:48:42.093]  You, Laura, Milo, Paul Joseph Watson, everybody who's been banned yesterday.
[02:48:42.093 --> 02:48:51.861]  And here's why I think they did it to you guys first, because actually they want to come after more mainstream conservatives, but they know that they have to shift the Overton window a little bit in order to go after that.
[02:48:52.461 --> 02:48:54.002]  And make it look like it's Farrakhan.
[02:48:54.002 --> 02:48:54.342]  Exactly.
[02:48:54.342 --> 02:48:55.823]  It's Farrakhan and then us.
[02:48:55.823 --> 02:49:01.586]  And Drudge has the articles linked where Southern Poverty Law Center is listing hundreds of sites, including you, they want banned.
[02:49:02.645 --> 02:49:10.615]  Yeah, and people like myself and Jack Posobiec are next, but the people who are actually complaining that we're complaining, i.e.
[02:49:10.615 --> 02:49:14.940]  the Ben Shapiros of the world, they're next after that, and they don't realize it.
[02:49:14.940 --> 02:49:15.481]  Bingo!
[02:49:15.481 --> 02:49:18.464]  I'm interrupting because you're so on target, I should have opened the show with that.
[02:49:18.464 --> 02:49:22.409]  The way they've tricked conservatives to go, I'm glad Farrakhan, nobody's listening to Farrakhan
[02:49:23.250 --> 02:49:24.771]  He's got his people and that's it.
[02:49:24.771 --> 02:49:28.033]  So the idea of, well, I'm glad you're finally getting new sensor 2.
[02:49:28.033 --> 02:49:32.096]  We just bought into it when it's going to be mainline conservatives that are real targets.
[02:49:32.096 --> 02:49:36.439]  So I'm interrupting, but yeah, restart what you're saying is the smartest thing we've said all day.
[02:49:36.439 --> 02:49:37.600]  That's exactly it.
[02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:39.061]  This is the Trojan horse.
[02:49:39.061 --> 02:49:41.063]  The conservatives accept the total collapse.
[02:49:42.045 --> 02:49:51.978]  That's right, and it pains me greatly that there are these sort of mainstream establishment Republicans going, oh my free market, my free market, these companies can do what they want.
[02:49:51.978 --> 02:49:56.665]  The fact is there is no difference, there is no distinction between the digital space and the public space.
[02:49:57.005 --> 02:49:57.505]  I don't think so.
[02:50:16.314 --> 02:50:19.016]  You know, Mark Zuckerberg is not the be-all and end-all of Facebook.
[02:50:19.016 --> 02:50:23.078]  It is an army of people that they have there, an army of enforcers that they have in there.
[02:50:23.078 --> 02:50:29.842]  This lady who emailed me yesterday telling me that I wasn't allowed to say something 11 years ago because it offended a protected class of people.
[02:50:29.842 --> 02:50:36.827]  Look, the fact is, I'm afraid, that for anybody who ostensibly is on our side, i.e.
[02:50:36.827 --> 02:50:40.309]  you believe in the Constitution, you believe in conservatism, you believe in small government,
[02:50:40.629 --> 02:50:41.729]  All of those things.
[02:50:41.729 --> 02:50:45.891]  If you are now making excuses for Facebook, then you're going to be banned next.
[02:50:45.891 --> 02:50:49.873]  And don't blame me for dancing on your digital grave when it happens.
[02:50:49.873 --> 02:50:53.714]  I have no reason to feel sorry for you in that regard when that happens to you.
[02:50:53.714 --> 02:51:00.817]  Alex, look, we have a real crisis situation now because it's not about just what's going on to you.
[02:51:00.817 --> 02:51:06.439]  This is about the greatest country this world has ever seen is being assailed.
[02:51:06.439 --> 02:51:07.139]  It's principles
[02:51:07.199 --> 02:51:22.302]  It's falling to a bunch of control freaks that trick people to get into their digital lives and are now spying and using it against us with an army of SJWs trained in universities engaging in Stasi-level crimes to the next... And I agree, it's not about me.
[02:51:22.302 --> 02:51:25.082]  I'm flamboyant, they've demonized me, they've built a straw man.
[02:51:25.082 --> 02:51:29.923]  They're using me as the demon to destroy everybody else's freedom.
[02:51:29.923 --> 02:51:30.944]  I'm saying this.
[02:51:30.944 --> 02:51:32.244]  I am not the issue, people.
[02:51:32.924 --> 02:51:35.587]  In fact, at the end of the day, I'll probably get bigger!
[02:51:35.587 --> 02:51:37.629]  But there'll be no country left!
[02:51:37.629 --> 02:51:38.550]  So stop it!
[02:51:38.550 --> 02:51:40.612]  Stop it, people!
[02:51:40.612 --> 02:51:41.013]  Right.
[02:51:41.013 --> 02:51:42.775]  That's exactly right, Alex.
[02:51:42.775 --> 02:51:43.535]  So what do we do?
[02:51:43.535 --> 02:51:43.856]  What do we do?
[02:51:44.921 --> 02:51:48.685]  Well, first things first, I think we have to now organize en masse.
[02:51:48.685 --> 02:51:53.129]  You know, we have to, all of us, come together in the same place at the same time.
[02:51:53.129 --> 02:51:57.714]  You know, it's no good Laura Loomer just being herself outside Jack Dorsey's house.
[02:51:57.714 --> 02:51:59.135]  We all need to be doing that.
[02:51:59.135 --> 02:52:02.578]  We're going to go back to old school public protests and make sure that the news covers it.
[02:52:02.578 --> 02:52:02.899]  You're right.
[02:52:02.899 --> 02:52:04.000]  She's like Spartacus.
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:05.041]  Everybody's got to be Spartacus.
[02:52:05.771 --> 02:52:10.915]  Everybody must be Spartacus at this point, and all credit to her for sticking her neck out and doing this way before anybody else was.
[02:52:10.915 --> 02:52:12.797]  I think we all need to start following in her footsteps.
[02:52:12.797 --> 02:52:19.782]  The other thing we need to do is stop electing these crappy conservatives who don't actually believe in defending their own people that vote for them.
[02:52:19.782 --> 02:52:20.403]  Okay?
[02:52:20.403 --> 02:52:23.866]  And if President Trump wants to put himself amongst those people, then so be it.
[02:52:23.866 --> 02:52:25.327]  He needs to act on this as well.
[02:52:25.327 --> 02:52:28.870]  Robert will tell you, from a legal perspective, there are many avenues we can pursue here.
[02:52:28.870 --> 02:52:31.592]  From a legislative perspective, there are a lot of avenues we can have here.
[02:52:31.872 --> 02:52:38.879]  I know you have a big audience and you have very, very, you know, people who are willing to fund fights like this going ahead right now.
[02:52:38.879 --> 02:52:47.366]  We need to build our own sort of platform whereby we can one-click let everybody in that Congress know who's ostensibly on our side.
[02:52:47.366 --> 02:52:49.148]  We need our own Sleeping Giants.
[02:52:49.148 --> 02:52:51.950]  We need our own database of folks ready to go to war.
[02:52:52.631 --> 02:52:53.132]  Well, precisely.
[02:52:53.132 --> 02:52:55.275]  There needs to be a sort of coordinated collective action.
[02:52:55.275 --> 02:52:57.578]  I mean, it's great that Human Events is restarting.
[02:52:57.578 --> 02:53:07.894]  Will Chamberlain, who works also with Rahim, went into detail about how basically there needs to be a civil right access to a digital public square.
[02:53:08.234 --> 02:53:14.536]  And particularly when these big companies have chosen to be monopolies, this is what I've explained to other people, that's what makes them different than the ordinary free market.
[02:53:14.536 --> 02:53:16.777]  This isn't some little guy competing on the street corner.
[02:53:16.777 --> 02:53:19.458]  This is a big giant that's decided to be a monopoly.
[02:53:19.458 --> 02:53:23.259]  With a monopoly comes obligations, particularly when you decide to monopolize the public space.
[02:53:23.259 --> 02:53:25.320]  And when you advertise that you're open and free, but you're not.
[02:53:25.320 --> 02:53:31.903]  We're going to, as you finish up next hour, you're going to co-host with Owen when I go meet with my imaginary children that the media says were taken away.
[02:53:31.903 --> 02:53:32.323]  But Rahim,
[02:53:33.143 --> 02:53:38.746]  Because I've heard from Bob, and he's a smart guy, what do you think the solutions are Trump needs to do?
[02:53:38.746 --> 02:53:43.569]  But other than that, obviously the ace of spades is Trump needs to do something on this.
[02:53:43.569 --> 02:53:48.091]  This is racketeering, this is criminal, Section 230 violation, election meddling.
[02:53:48.091 --> 02:53:52.113]  I mean, I like Trump on a bunch of other issues, but man, I gotta be honest.
[02:53:52.113 --> 02:53:55.655]  I mean, it's like, he's not this stupid.
[02:53:55.655 --> 02:53:57.036]  So what's really going on?
[02:53:57.036 --> 02:54:01.178]  Are they behind the scenes battling over who gets control of the NSA system?
[02:54:01.178 --> 02:54:02.279]  Because that's what this really is.
[02:54:03.393 --> 02:54:11.359]  You know, I couldn't tell you what's going on in the President's mind at the moment, but I certainly hope he's not just being distracted by trying to run Venezuela instead of running the United States right now.
[02:54:11.359 --> 02:54:13.161]  I hope that's not the case.
[02:54:13.161 --> 02:54:27.712]  For me, if I were him right now, I would immediately assemble an executive task force to look into this, report back to the White House within a month with its findings, and then you put together on Capitol Hill a group of legislators who are willing to draft the legislation
[02:54:28.312 --> 02:54:39.938]  To redraft the Communications Decency Act, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, strip these platforms of their protections under the law, whereby they can't be sued by ordinary people for the actions that are being taken against them.
[02:54:39.938 --> 02:54:50.643]  And at that point, you've got not just the moral right on your side, you actually have a pretty good campaign platform for going into the next election.
[02:54:50.643 --> 02:54:53.765]  It is ordinary people versus the would-be masters of the universe.
[02:54:53.985 --> 02:54:56.247]  And that's what the 2020 election is going to be about.
[02:54:56.247 --> 02:54:59.109]  It's back to the old deplorables mantra and mindset.
[02:54:59.109 --> 02:55:00.250]  I totally agree.
[02:55:00.250 --> 02:55:04.254]  And it's a unifying thing, even on some of the left, to get behind free speech.
[02:55:04.254 --> 02:55:08.057]  And Trump's looking for that perfect thing to fix it.
[02:55:08.057 --> 02:55:10.779]  All he's got to do is tell big tech, I know what you're doing.
[02:55:10.779 --> 02:55:13.442]  I know Clinton and Obama stay behind networks have you doing this.
[02:55:14.142 --> 02:55:15.903]  No doubt, I mean he's got to take action.
[02:55:33.621 --> 02:55:35.203]  No, I was going to say that's exactly right.
[02:55:35.203 --> 02:55:46.454]  And even when we relaunched Human Events earlier this week, we knew that if we tried to make money through advertising or anything like that, it's just not going to happen.
[02:55:46.454 --> 02:55:52.880]  So instead, we set up a membership way of doing things where people can actually join us and contribute to us and know that they're helping keeping
[02:55:53.240 --> 02:55:53.520]  You're insane!
[02:56:23.721 --> 02:56:24.801]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[02:56:24.801 --> 02:56:28.845]  I mean, I'm one of the founding people involved in supporting human events.
[02:56:28.845 --> 02:56:29.445]  Does great work.
[02:56:29.445 --> 02:56:37.952]  But if people don't coordinate action and don't support the legal action that you're taking, that other people are taking, then what's going to happen is they're going to be able to shut down and silence everybody.
[02:56:37.952 --> 02:56:38.272]  I agree.
[02:56:38.272 --> 02:56:39.233]  Let's cover when we come back.
[02:56:39.233 --> 02:56:46.178]  Raheem, please come back and talk about the big cover stories about the new type of woman the Democrats are trying to run with this division politics.
[02:56:46.178 --> 02:56:47.299]  So please join us next week.
[02:56:47.299 --> 02:56:47.799]  God bless you.
[02:56:47.799 --> 02:56:48.280]  Thanks for the time.
[02:56:49.022 --> 02:56:50.064]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:56:50.064 --> 02:56:51.206]  Bob, you'll have the floor.
[02:56:51.206 --> 02:56:52.008]  You're a machine.
[02:56:52.008 --> 02:56:55.514]  I'm gonna take a drink of water, you go to the bathroom, you wanna host the next hour of that one, you're doing it.
[02:56:55.514 --> 02:56:58.800]  I'm gonna take one of my imaginary children out of custody to the doctor.
[02:56:59.710 --> 02:56:59.910]  I don't
[02:57:21.001 --> 02:57:22.221]  We're good to go.
[02:57:44.992 --> 02:57:50.554]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[02:58:46.189 --> 02:58:52.078]  Grandparents and great-grandparents knew they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.

[02:59:49.030 --> 02:59:51.693]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.496 --> 03:00:02.917]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:00:02.917 --> 03:00:06.938]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.938 --> 03:00:09.780]  Okay, coming up, we've got a Mark Geiss report.
[03:00:09.780 --> 03:00:10.540]  We haven't aired yet.
[03:00:10.540 --> 03:00:12.040]  It's extremely informative.
[03:00:12.040 --> 03:00:12.901]  Let's just say that.
[03:00:12.901 --> 03:00:14.841]  Everything on this show is powerful.
[03:00:14.841 --> 03:00:15.922]  I want to say powerful.
[03:00:15.922 --> 03:00:16.542]  It is powerful.
[03:00:43.922 --> 03:00:44.823]  Welcome back, folks.
[03:00:44.823 --> 03:00:49.785]  We are the Godzilla of news and information, the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:00:49.785 --> 03:00:51.486]  They say he's got to go.
[03:00:51.486 --> 03:00:56.149]  Alex Jones!
[03:00:56.149 --> 03:01:00.611]  Oh, they say he's got to go.
[03:01:00.611 --> 03:01:01.972]  There goes your new world order.
[03:01:01.972 --> 03:01:05.294]  All right, I'm going to start having some fun with this.
[03:01:06.542 --> 03:01:11.125]  We got the report coming up and then Barnes and Owen Schwartz will be here together.
[03:01:11.125 --> 03:01:13.727]  I am taking my daughter to the doctor.
[03:01:13.727 --> 03:01:16.910]  I'll have to go to their medical appointments even though it's no big deal.
[03:01:16.910 --> 03:01:18.931]  And then I'm going to come back up here tonight.
[03:01:18.931 --> 03:01:20.613]  I'll be back up here in the saddle.
[03:01:20.613 --> 03:01:22.454]  I'm going on Newsmax TV.
[03:01:22.454 --> 03:01:23.775]  I'm going on Gavin McGinnis' show.
[03:01:23.775 --> 03:01:25.376]  I'm doing some other shows.
[03:01:25.376 --> 03:01:31.280]  And I just, I think a little pixie told me, a little sprite told me we'll probably do a live show tonight.
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:32.942]  So look for that coming up.
[03:01:34.005 --> 03:01:35.966]  than the war rooms at three o'clock.
[03:01:35.966 --> 03:01:38.668]  But I just want to say something about DrudgeReport.com.
[03:01:38.668 --> 03:01:44.571]  I mean, I never ask Drudge to link to our stories, unless we're in an emergency.
[03:01:44.571 --> 03:01:52.656]  And it's just so good, because we'll do the regular show, a couple million tune in, and hundreds of thousands watch the streams, but, over the day.
[03:01:52.656 --> 03:01:56.619]  But when Drudge links to it, sometimes it's millions.
[03:01:56.619 --> 03:01:59.180]  Sometimes even 14, 15 million.
[03:01:59.180 --> 03:02:03.243]  And so it just feels good to know there's a place out there like DrudgeReport.com
[03:02:05.461 --> 03:02:08.782]  That isn't under intimidation, isn't under their control.
[03:02:08.782 --> 03:02:12.042]  And look at this link banning, latest censorship tool.
[03:02:12.042 --> 03:02:16.423]  Journalism Institute tries to blacklist conservative outlets as un-news.
[03:02:16.423 --> 03:02:22.224]  This fake news got put back by the president on them, so now it's false news and un-news.
[03:02:22.224 --> 03:02:23.744]  There's an old Backlash article.
[03:02:23.744 --> 03:02:33.346]  People are seeing right through this, the elitism of telling you what you can visit and what you can do and what you can read.
[03:02:33.346 --> 03:02:34.086]  Again, I'll never forget
[03:02:36.124 --> 03:02:40.908]  I was like 14, I'd read a bunch of books on World War II, thought they were really interesting that my parents had.
[03:02:40.908 --> 03:02:46.273]  So I went to the local bookstore back when the mall had little bookstores that, you know, and I'd go in and I'd get Mein Kampf.
[03:02:46.273 --> 03:02:47.714]  It was a big orange copy.
[03:02:47.714 --> 03:02:48.936]  My struggle.
[03:02:48.936 --> 03:02:51.278]  Unreadable gibberish once I got it.
[03:02:51.278 --> 03:02:55.902]  I was reading like Old Man and the Sea and For Whom the Bell Tolls and all this other stuff.
[03:02:55.902 --> 03:02:57.083]  I thought it was beautiful literature.
[03:02:57.083 --> 03:02:58.764]  I was reading The Odyssey.
[03:02:58.764 --> 03:02:59.685]  I read Hitler's book.
[03:02:59.685 --> 03:03:01.387]  I was like, this is crap.
[03:03:01.387 --> 03:03:02.228]  But regardless.
[03:03:03.390 --> 03:03:06.151]  The woman asked because I was blonde-haired, blue-eyed, are you a Nazi?
[03:03:06.151 --> 03:03:08.272]  And I said, are you a Nazi?
[03:03:08.272 --> 03:03:09.652]  Selling this book?
[03:03:09.652 --> 03:03:10.973]  You idiot!
[03:03:10.973 --> 03:03:14.374]  I was 14 light-years smarter than her!
[03:03:14.374 --> 03:03:17.735]  I've read Das Kapital!
[03:03:17.735 --> 03:03:19.976]  Written by Karl Marx!
[03:03:19.976 --> 03:03:21.937]  And Engels!
[03:03:21.937 --> 03:03:25.998]  So, and boy, that was a bunch of crap too!
[03:03:25.998 --> 03:03:27.579]  So, there's this mindset
[03:03:28.610 --> 03:03:31.191]  Where if you read something, you're what you read.
[03:03:31.191 --> 03:03:35.294]  Or if I look at something, I become that thing.
[03:03:35.294 --> 03:03:37.755]  And maybe for followers, that's the case, but it's not here.
[03:03:37.755 --> 03:03:43.378]  It's just so crazy that this is brazen tyranny.
[03:03:43.378 --> 03:03:48.321]  This is butt-naked, flaming death.
[03:03:48.321 --> 03:03:49.421]  Cancer.
[03:03:49.421 --> 03:03:52.183]  It should be rejected by everybody, but it's not being.
[03:03:53.683 --> 03:03:56.604]  And that shows you people have become domesticated.
[03:03:56.604 --> 03:03:58.224]  They've become stupid.
[03:03:58.224 --> 03:03:59.924]  And not all of us, but a large portion.
[03:03:59.924 --> 03:04:02.885]  And so we're in a crisis.
[03:04:02.885 --> 03:04:07.846]  So we have a very powerful report with Mark Dice coming up and then Paul Watson.
[03:04:07.846 --> 03:04:09.386]  And you know they're going to ban Mark Dice too.
[03:04:09.386 --> 03:04:15.728]  They're just going to go right down the line like Matt Grudge said at these offices three years ago.
[03:04:15.728 --> 03:04:16.908]  Three and a half years ago.
[03:04:16.908 --> 03:04:19.568]  Come back and see us, Matt.
[03:04:19.568 --> 03:04:20.469]  Can't bitch.
[03:04:20.469 --> 03:04:21.729]  He's in one other interview since then.
[03:04:23.909 --> 03:04:28.011]  But the point is, is that it all happened.
[03:04:28.011 --> 03:04:31.093]  And we should have even more earnestly set up backups.
[03:04:31.093 --> 03:04:32.654]  But we did set up the backups.
[03:04:32.654 --> 03:04:34.675]  Our own video, our own audio, our own websites.
[03:04:34.675 --> 03:04:36.236]  And they're trying to take those away.
[03:04:36.236 --> 03:04:37.997]  And our bank accounts, and our servers.
[03:04:37.997 --> 03:04:39.778]  I mean, it's a daily warrior.
[03:04:39.778 --> 03:04:42.739]  But we're not victims, it's made us stronger.
[03:04:42.739 --> 03:04:44.941]  But our power is you.
[03:04:44.941 --> 03:04:47.282]  You're the oxygen in our lungs.
[03:04:47.282 --> 03:04:50.284]  So please financially support us and great products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:04:50.284 --> 03:04:50.744]  Stay with us.

[03:04:59.065 --> 03:05:07.629]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:05:07.629 --> 03:05:10.611]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:05:10.611 --> 03:05:12.351]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:05:12.351 --> 03:05:18.634]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[03:05:20.715 --> 03:05:26.037]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[03:05:26.037 --> 03:05:28.998]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:05:28.998 --> 03:05:32.940]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:05:32.940 --> 03:05:36.901]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:05:36.901 --> 03:05:38.722]  I've got two in my home.
[03:05:38.722 --> 03:05:44.824]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:05:44.824 --> 03:05:45.665]  Don't live
[03:05:46.505 --> 03:05:50.568]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[03:05:50.568 --> 03:05:51.828]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:06:05.564 --> 03:06:10.425]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:06:10.425 --> 03:06:12.085]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:12.085 --> 03:06:13.746]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:13.746 --> 03:06:20.387]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:20.387 --> 03:06:34.590]  Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, and Bob Loganopoulos were just unpersoned by Facebook yesterday in the latest purge of prominent conservative voices, and they were labeled dangerous people and then lumped in with Louis Farrakhan, who was also banned.
[03:06:34.590 --> 03:06:35.330]  Of course, Facebook
[03:06:35.350 --> 03:06:53.777]  Trump did not ban the Smash Racism DC page, the Antifa DC page, which organized that harassment campaign against Tucker Carlson by literally creating an event for it, posting his home address surrounding his home, and then telling him that, quote, he's not safe and they know where he sleeps.

[03:07:17.751 --> 03:07:27.657]  What else is interesting is that the reports were already published and circulating from CNN, of course, and others, saying that they were banned before they were actually banned.
[03:07:27.657 --> 03:07:45.249]  It looks like CNN had their article written and ready to publish for the moment the ban took place, and then once they were given a heads up from their Facebook contact, yep, we're gonna ban them right now, they published the article, but it took Facebook a few minutes to finally get around to actually deleting the accounts.
[03:07:45.709 --> 03:07:57.954]  The Atlantic is reporting that if anybody posts any InfoWars articles or videos on their Facebook page, those posts will be removed and repeat offenders will also be banned.
[03:07:57.954 --> 03:08:11.020]  TechCrunch is reporting that Facebook may start engaging in pre-crime detection, like the Tom Cruise movie Minority Report, and it may just start deleting people's pages before they actually violate the policies.
[03:08:11.340 --> 03:08:36.481]  In her book, Hate, Why We Should Resist It With Free Speech, Not Censorship, by Nadine Strassman, the former president of the ACLU, she quotes George Washington University professor Jeffrey Rosen, who says that social media platforms, although not formally bound by the First Amendment, since they are technically private corporations, right, they have a democratic obligation to embrace something close to the constitutional standard.
[03:08:36.601 --> 03:08:42.328]  Like universities and media outlets, online speech platforms should not be safe spaces.
[03:08:42.328 --> 03:08:50.056]  They should be democratic spaces with the ultimate victors in the clash of ideas determined by reason and deliberation.
[03:08:51.578 --> 03:09:13.338]  Prior to the Civil War, many southern states made it illegal for people to actually denounce slavery because they didn't want abolitionist ideas to spread, saying, quote, the leading pro-slavery advocate, Senator John C. Calhoun, argued that abolitionists who criticized slavery libeled the South and inflicted emotional injury.
[03:09:13.638 --> 03:09:27.870]  During the 1830s, many southern states enacted laws suppressing abolitionist speech, which was feared to spur violence, in particular, slave rebellions, and indeed, to threaten the nation's very survival.
[03:09:27.870 --> 03:09:33.575]  So, one time it was actually illegal in certain states to say that you were against slavery.
[03:09:33.575 --> 03:09:38.320]  Kind of like today how it's a violation of big tax terms of service to say that there are only two genders.
[03:09:38.880 --> 03:09:46.086]  But Congressman Jamie Raskin and other Democrats say that it's just a conspiracy theory that conservatives are being censored on social media.
[03:09:46.086 --> 03:09:54.472]  So today, we resume consideration of the entirely imaginary narrative that social media companies are biased against conservatives.
[03:09:54.472 --> 03:10:02.619]  Companies, I should add, whose platforms were used to spread vicious Russian propaganda that helped to elect Donald Trump president.
[03:10:02.819 --> 03:10:06.542]  Oh, I'm just imagining that Paul Joseph Watson's Facebook page has been deleted.
[03:10:06.542 --> 03:10:09.364]  Did you want to say something stupid, Jabba the Hutt Nadler?
[03:10:09.364 --> 03:10:21.932]  Before we delve into these questions, I must first dispense with a completely illegitimate issue, which is the fantasy, dreamed up by some conservatives, that Google and other online platforms have an anti-conservative bias.
[03:10:21.932 --> 03:10:26.916]  As I've said repeatedly, no credible evidence supports this right-wing conspiracy theory.
[03:10:27.236 --> 03:10:34.678]  It's actually a conspiracy fact, sir, and speaking of conspiracies, here's a clip from G. Edward Griffin from 50 years ago.
[03:10:34.678 --> 03:10:43.101]  He's the author of the fantastic book, The Creature from Jekyll Island, exposing the Federal Reserve banking cartel, warning about just this kind of thing.
[03:10:43.101 --> 03:10:50.303]  In 1943, the following directive was issued from party headquarters to all communists in the United States.
[03:10:50.303 --> 03:10:54.885]  It read, when certain obstructionists become too irritating,
[03:10:55.698 --> 03:11:07.422]  Label them, after suitable build-ups, as fascist, or Nazi, or anti-semitic, and use the prestige of anti-fascist and tolerance organizations to discredit them.
[03:11:07.422 --> 03:11:13.924]  In the public mind, constantly associate those who oppose us with those names which already have a bad smell.
[03:11:14.739 --> 03:11:19.722]  The association will, after enough repetition, become fact in the public mind.
[03:11:44.759 --> 03:11:54.588]  At this rate it won't be much longer until the big tech companies start banning people for saying that abortion is murder because they'll consider it to be hateful against the people who murder their babies.
[03:11:54.588 --> 03:12:09.442]  I'm getting really sick of this censorship so I want every single one of you to create a new contact in your phone and save the number to the United States Capitol switchboard in there and call them as soon as this video is done and call them every time somebody new gets censored.
[03:12:09.762 --> 03:12:18.068]  All you need to do is call this number and they will forward your call to your senator or your member in the House of Representatives and you tell them what's going on.
[03:12:18.068 --> 03:12:26.694]  From now on, instead of just posting about it on social media or making YouTube videos about it, every time somebody new gets censored, we're gonna start calling Congress.
[03:12:27.034 --> 03:12:28.654]  And there's the number to the White House, guys!
[03:12:28.654 --> 03:12:35.216]  I want every single one of you to save it in your phones, and it's time to start making our voices heard loud and clear.
[03:12:35.216 --> 03:12:39.937]  In times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[03:12:39.937 --> 03:12:44.138]  I gave you a little bit too much truth, and now I must be silenced.
[03:12:44.138 --> 03:12:49.839]  Banned by Facebook, banned by Instagram, and now the media says Louis Farrakhan is far right.
[03:12:50.299 --> 03:12:50.919]  What?!
[03:12:50.919 --> 03:12:55.880]  They obviously banned Farrakhan at the same time to give them the excuse that this wasn't political.
[03:12:55.880 --> 03:12:57.540]  It was totally political.
[03:12:57.540 --> 03:13:00.441]  This is nothing less than election meddling.
[03:13:00.441 --> 03:13:05.242]  Everyone Facebook has banned was instrumental in getting Donald Trump elected.
[03:13:05.242 --> 03:13:06.402]  This is punishment.
[03:13:06.402 --> 03:13:08.063]  This is a political purge.
[03:13:08.063 --> 03:13:12.563]  This has nothing to do with hate or violating terms of service.
[03:13:12.563 --> 03:13:14.664]  Russians buy a few Facebook ads.
[03:13:14.664 --> 03:13:15.224]  Leftists.
[03:13:15.444 --> 03:13:16.325]  This is horrendous!
[03:13:16.325 --> 03:13:17.566]  This is election meddling!
[03:13:17.566 --> 03:13:19.487]  Democracy's at stake!
[03:13:19.487 --> 03:13:23.070]  Facebook bans most of the people who helped get Trump elected.
[03:13:23.070 --> 03:13:24.911]  Leftists and boomers.
[03:13:24.911 --> 03:13:25.492]  Herd him!
[03:13:25.492 --> 03:13:27.553]  A private company can do what it likes!
[03:13:27.553 --> 03:13:29.615]  The creepiest thing is not the bans.
[03:13:29.615 --> 03:13:34.699]  It's the threat that anyone else will be banned for talking about the people who were banned.
[03:13:34.699 --> 03:13:35.559]  That's chilling.
[03:13:35.559 --> 03:13:41.544]  That's giant corporations enforcing their own communist Chinese-style social credit system.
[03:13:41.544 --> 03:13:43.105]  And leftists love it.
[03:13:43.385 --> 03:13:48.027]  I was given no reason whatsoever for being banned by Facebook or Instagram.
[03:13:48.027 --> 03:13:49.508]  So I'm dangerous.
[03:13:49.508 --> 03:13:53.289]  Someone who makes meme videos laughing at social justice warriors.
[03:13:53.289 --> 03:14:00.732]  Or is handing the power to decide who gets to have free speech to a handful of giant politically partisan corporations dangerous.
[03:14:00.732 --> 03:14:02.253]  What's more dangerous?
[03:14:02.253 --> 03:14:07.255]  They put me on a list with terrorists, human traffickers and serial killers.
[03:14:07.415 --> 03:14:10.218]  Because I criticise modern art and modern architecture.
[03:14:10.218 --> 03:14:12.460]  Because I dare criticise mass immigration.
[03:14:12.460 --> 03:14:15.323]  Because I dare criticise a belief system.
[03:14:15.323 --> 03:14:19.868]  Yet you still host Antifa accounts which threaten to assassinate the President.
[03:14:19.868 --> 03:14:25.033]  You still host accounts belonging to the sicko who sent death threats to Ben Shapiro's family.
[03:14:25.213 --> 03:14:28.497]  This is truly, truly clown world.
[03:14:28.497 --> 03:14:32.643]  And notice how the media were tipped off over an hour in advance of me getting banned.
[03:14:32.643 --> 03:14:39.452]  The same media that's been lobbying for conservatives to be silenced, censored and deplatformed for the past two years.
[03:14:39.452 --> 03:14:42.056]  There are barely any real journalists left.
[03:14:42.236 --> 03:14:49.059]  They're all activists, abusing their power, working hand-in-hand with big tech to eliminate their competition.
[03:14:49.059 --> 03:14:53.861]  When are we going to see any kind of sensible regulations or laws to stop this?
[03:14:53.861 --> 03:14:59.864]  They're now removing people's ability to have bank accounts and credit cards because they have the wrong opinions.
[03:14:59.864 --> 03:15:03.645]  They're literally trying to remove your right to buy and sell.
[03:15:03.645 --> 03:15:05.166]  This is biblical.
[03:15:05.166 --> 03:15:08.587]  No right to commerce unless you have the mark.
[03:15:08.587 --> 03:15:09.668]  And what is the mark?
[03:15:10.268 --> 03:15:13.770]  Total intellectual castration and obedience.
[03:15:13.770 --> 03:15:15.651]  So this looks like it's the end.
[03:15:15.651 --> 03:15:18.193]  I'll still be at summit.news while that exists.
[03:15:18.193 --> 03:15:23.356]  While I exist as my entire purpose for existing is snuffed out.
[03:15:23.356 --> 03:15:31.481]  While society is handed over to deranged infantilized crybabies who think hate speech is challenging their stupid opinions.
[03:15:31.481 --> 03:15:39.326]  Hysterical authoritarian clowns have seized control of the new public square and conservatives did nothing to stop it.
[03:15:39.486 --> 03:15:42.511]  The Trump administration did nothing to stop it.
[03:15:42.511 --> 03:15:44.213]  You thought it would stop at Alex Jones?
[03:15:44.213 --> 03:15:45.736]  You think it's gonna stop at me?
[03:15:45.736 --> 03:15:48.419]  You think it's gonna stop at Facebook accounts?
[03:15:48.419 --> 03:15:51.604]  They even demanded YouTube remove Ben Shapiro!
[03:15:52.961 --> 03:15:56.842]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[03:17:23.772 --> 03:17:27.693]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:27.693 --> 03:17:29.233]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.233 --> 03:17:32.194]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.194 --> 03:17:37.755]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[03:19:56.515 --> 03:19:59.197]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:07.366 --> 03:20:12.849]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Troyer.
[03:20:12.849 --> 03:20:16.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.892 --> 03:20:32.102]  I think the ACLU needs to take a look in the mirror, because remember what happened when private bakeries, private businesses, small businesses,
[03:20:33.095 --> 03:20:39.599]  Specifically bakeries that didn't want to custom make a gay wedding cake.
[03:20:39.599 --> 03:20:44.843]  Remember the ACLU came out and the left came out and said, you're not allowed to do that.
[03:20:44.843 --> 03:20:57.131]  We as progressive liberal Democrats, we as bureaucrats, we as lawyers, dirtbags over at the ACLU, we decide.
[03:20:57.131 --> 03:20:58.832]  We decide who you can serve.
[03:21:00.242 --> 03:21:07.945]  So they didn't care about the sanctity of private businesses then.
[03:21:07.945 --> 03:21:17.369]  It's funny that they should care about it now, when they ban conservatives off of their platforms.
[03:21:17.369 --> 03:21:28.773]  So I just have to ask the ACLU if they retract their 2012 article, businesses do not have a license to discriminate.
[03:21:31.254 --> 03:21:36.318]  Because isn't that what this really is at the end of the day?
[03:21:36.318 --> 03:21:43.743]  And I think it's pathetic that you have what would be considered... I mean, if you make it on MSNBC or CNN, right?
[03:21:43.743 --> 03:21:45.705]  I mean, you're considered the best, right?
[03:21:45.705 --> 03:21:49.848]  I mean, Fox News, I mean, those are the big TV cable news networks.
[03:21:49.848 --> 03:21:50.849]  They make the big money.
[03:21:50.849 --> 03:21:54.091]  Like, you've got to be the best to get on a TV news network, right?
[03:21:54.091 --> 03:21:58.234]  Well, do you see what MSNBC and CNN puts on air?
[03:21:58.234 --> 03:21:58.935]  That's their best.
[03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:08.576]  And so it's like they just go along with this whole thing like, oh yeah, they censored Alex Jones because he's bad.
[03:22:08.576 --> 03:22:09.897]  He's violent.
[03:22:09.897 --> 03:22:12.079]  He's stirring up political hatred.
[03:22:12.079 --> 03:22:14.121]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:22:14.121 --> 03:22:16.302]  Yeah, there's Cassie Casey Hill with...
[03:22:17.263 --> 03:22:19.264]  Ben Collins yesterday.
[03:22:19.264 --> 03:22:21.885]  Both of them watch InfoWars 24-7.
[03:22:21.885 --> 03:22:24.207]  So I had to give Ben Collins a little fashion advice.
[03:22:24.207 --> 03:22:25.947]  By the way, I invited him on the show.
[03:22:25.947 --> 03:22:28.669]  I said, hey, you just did a segment on MSNBC yesterday.
[03:22:28.669 --> 03:22:30.670]  Yeah, that was the look on his face when we covered him.
[03:22:30.670 --> 03:22:35.392]  He finally actually had somebody watching his content because we covered it on InfoWars.
[03:22:35.392 --> 03:22:41.635]  And I said, hey, you just did a segment on InfoWars and on Alex Jones there on the old MSNBC.
[03:22:41.635 --> 03:22:43.256]  Why don't you come on InfoWars and discuss it?
[03:22:46.929 --> 03:22:50.051]  And that was pretty much the response I got from Ben.
[03:22:50.051 --> 03:22:56.094]  But hey, he gets more love here than he ever does at MSNBC.
[03:22:56.094 --> 03:23:03.498]  It's like these Huffington Post writers that follow us around and it's like that's their victory.
[03:23:03.498 --> 03:23:10.082]  It's just being little gnats in our ear when they have no audience.
[03:23:10.082 --> 03:23:11.062]  But congratulations!
[03:23:11.062 --> 03:23:13.463]  I mean, look, you guys did it.
[03:23:13.463 --> 03:23:15.965]  You guys are killing free speech in America.
[03:23:17.366 --> 03:23:19.387]  Kudos to you!
[03:23:19.387 --> 03:23:20.527]  Good for you!
[03:23:20.527 --> 03:23:25.249]  The liberals and progressives and democrats and the left used to be about free speech.
[03:23:25.249 --> 03:23:27.149]  What happened?
[03:23:27.149 --> 03:23:28.810]  What happened?
[03:23:28.810 --> 03:23:30.971]  That happened right there.
[03:23:30.971 --> 03:23:40.254]  That rat, turd-eating CNN host, Oliver Darcy, who applied for a job here and is so bitter
[03:23:41.479 --> 03:23:45.661]  Because the truth is, it doesn't take much to work at CNN.
[03:23:45.661 --> 03:23:48.422]  Oliver Darcy couldn't handle working here.
[03:23:48.422 --> 03:23:53.625]  He'd be wearing Depends around this office if he had a job here.
[03:23:53.625 --> 03:23:58.607]  He might be wearing pull-ups now, as he's probably tuned into this.
[03:23:58.607 --> 03:24:04.670]  So, bitter little Oliver Darcy, with a you-know-what eating grin on his face.
[03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:07.631]  This is a 40-year-old plus man, I think, here.
[03:24:07.631 --> 03:24:08.912]  And he's so immature,
[03:24:10.629 --> 03:24:17.275]  He spends his entire life trying to get InfoWars banned.
[03:24:17.275 --> 03:24:21.238]  What a sad existence.
[03:24:21.238 --> 03:24:24.661]  What a sad existence for these people.
[03:24:24.661 --> 03:24:33.549]  So congratulations though, you guys have killed free speech in the West, and you've now made it almost official policy.
[03:24:33.549 --> 03:24:36.972]  This will come up in the 2020 campaign cycle.
[03:24:38.223 --> 03:24:45.473]  And if there's a smart Democrat out there, they'll actually bring up the censorship issue.
[03:24:45.473 --> 03:24:48.737]  And then, what is the left gonna do?
[03:24:48.737 --> 03:24:50.840]  They're gonna have to own that they're the side of censorship.
[03:24:50.840 --> 03:24:51.722]  They're gonna have to own
[03:24:52.830 --> 03:24:54.891]  That they are against free speech.
[03:24:54.891 --> 03:24:58.934]  Just like they now have owned that they like abortion.
[03:24:58.934 --> 03:25:01.015]  They actually celebrate abortion.
[03:25:01.015 --> 03:25:02.896]  Yeah, abortion is legal in this country.
[03:25:02.896 --> 03:25:05.358]  That's a sad thing that people have abortions.
[03:25:05.358 --> 03:25:06.318]  But it happens, okay?
[03:25:06.318 --> 03:25:07.079]  It's legal.
[03:25:07.079 --> 03:25:09.140]  They love it.
[03:25:09.140 --> 03:25:10.861]  They celebrate it.
[03:25:12.523 --> 03:25:14.404]  They get off to it.
[03:25:14.404 --> 03:25:15.864]  And it's all about deception.
[03:25:15.864 --> 03:25:19.306]  It's the deception that they can tell you it's not a kid.
[03:25:19.306 --> 03:25:23.267]  It's the deception that they can tell you that's not another human being.
[03:25:23.267 --> 03:25:27.309]  It's the deception that they can tell you InfoWars is an extremist group.
[03:25:27.309 --> 03:25:29.910]  It's the deception that they can say...
[03:25:31.653 --> 03:25:33.014]  Trump colluded with Russia.
[03:25:33.014 --> 03:25:34.415]  It's all about deception.
[03:25:34.415 --> 03:25:39.098]  The deception that they can say there's 76 different genders, and if you don't agree with that, you're a bigot.
[03:25:39.098 --> 03:25:42.461]  It's all about rubbing the deception in your face.
[03:25:42.461 --> 03:25:47.905]  See, they know the whole thing has been twisted upside down on its head.
[03:25:47.905 --> 03:25:54.490]  And so they just, in the clown world as clowns, use the clown system.
[03:25:54.490 --> 03:25:58.613]  It's like, oh yeah, 76 genders, like, that'll really tick them off, let's go with that.
[03:26:03.030 --> 03:26:08.998]  So, who knows how much longer even anyone will be able to exist on these things.
[03:26:08.998 --> 03:26:12.143]  I mean, they're going to mitigate themselves into oblivion.
[03:26:12.143 --> 03:26:17.790]  They won't even allow political discourse on there at this rate in a couple years.
[03:26:17.790 --> 03:26:19.553]  Or that'll even be the angle that they go with.
[03:26:21.860 --> 03:26:29.423]  And you know what, I'll just go ahead and say this now, and I haven't even done my due diligence with the tech people, just because there's so much else going on here.
[03:26:29.423 --> 03:26:35.226]  But, I mean, we created a platform, Infocomms.org, and
[03:26:36.403 --> 03:26:37.443]  It's totally free speech.
[03:26:37.443 --> 03:26:42.786]  And I mean, we even go there because, look, we have people that go in there and try to post things to make us look bad.
[03:26:42.786 --> 03:26:44.406]  And we know that that's what happens.
[03:26:44.406 --> 03:26:47.788]  And so we are trying to moderate it and censor that stuff.
[03:26:47.788 --> 03:26:49.308]  But it's just so out of control now.
[03:26:49.308 --> 03:26:53.190]  And I'm just like, I'm just telling the IT people, I'm saying, just leave it open.
[03:26:53.190 --> 03:26:56.851]  People want to go on there and post whatever garbage they're going to do it.
[03:26:56.851 --> 03:26:58.452]  Let's actually be free speech.
[03:26:58.452 --> 03:27:01.273]  Let's actually be the public forum that they claim to be.
[03:27:04.454 --> 03:27:09.176]  But none of it's possible without your support at InfoWarsTore.com, and I know you know that.
[03:27:09.176 --> 03:27:23.122]  And so now that they're suffocating all of our ability to reach the internet market, all of our ability to market on social media, now that they're sucking all the wind out of our sails for that, all we have is this platform.
[03:27:24.577 --> 03:27:28.419]  All we can do is market to the people who know about this platform.
[03:27:28.419 --> 03:27:36.122]  So, the least you can do is tell people about InfoWars, tell people why we're so censored, tell them where they can find this broadcast.
[03:27:36.122 --> 03:27:38.163]  And there's a reason why the young people like us.
[03:27:38.163 --> 03:27:43.186]  It's because we have that mystique.
[03:27:43.186 --> 03:27:44.546]  Well, why are they censored everywhere?
[03:27:44.546 --> 03:27:45.707]  Why is it banned?
[03:27:45.707 --> 03:27:47.288]  What makes them so bad?
[03:27:47.288 --> 03:27:52.830]  They keep saying they're doing hate speech and encouraging violence, then they tune in, they hear none of it, and they're like, what is this?
[03:27:52.830 --> 03:27:53.991]  There must be something else here.
[03:27:54.915 --> 03:27:57.278]  So take advantage of the specials at Infowarsstore.com.

[03:32:57.487 --> 03:33:00.089]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[03:33:16.198 --> 03:33:17.899]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:17.899 --> 03:33:19.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.880 --> 03:33:23.241]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:33:23.241 --> 03:33:27.404]  Alright, we've got 30 minutes left of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:27.404 --> 03:33:29.565]  I've got Robert Barnes in studio.
[03:33:29.565 --> 03:33:38.569]  I'm gonna have a couple of important conversations with him that I've just been seeing people having amongst themselves that we're gonna get Robert Barnes' expertise on.
[03:33:38.569 --> 03:33:39.310]  And then here's the deal.
[03:33:41.094 --> 03:33:52.941]  We did not take overall much phone calls this week so when I jump over into the other studio here in 30 minutes on the war room that I normally host from 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:33:52.941 --> 03:34:00.785]  Central at Infowars.com slash show I'm gonna open up the phone lines now I do have a couple important guests including Laura Luma Laura Loomer and and a few others but
[03:34:02.544 --> 03:34:02.784]  All right.
[03:34:23.157 --> 03:34:29.601]  Robert Barnes' take on just a few of the issues here before I ask him a question that I've just been seeing a lot of people talk about.
[03:34:29.601 --> 03:34:33.264]  So we have the ACLU putting out this story in 2012.
[03:34:33.264 --> 03:34:38.827]  And as you recalled when you saw the headline, the headline is, businesses do not have a license to discriminate.
[03:34:38.827 --> 03:34:40.949]  That's literally from the ACLU.org.
[03:34:40.949 --> 03:34:44.431]  Now we'll see if they print that same headline to stand up for enforce.
[03:34:44.431 --> 03:34:45.352]  I doubt it.
[03:34:45.352 --> 03:34:50.055]  But the whole case that they make, and people will recall it was a national case, was that
[03:34:51.013 --> 03:35:02.487]  If you're a bakery, a small town bakery in Colorado, I believe there were a couple of them though, but that was the big one, and the story was a gay couple goes in and says, hey, I want you to make me this cake.
[03:35:02.487 --> 03:35:09.035]  And it's not like they're ordering a pre-made cake or pointing out to this, it's a custom made cake, they'd have to make it themselves to do the whole design.
[03:35:09.615 --> 03:35:12.856]  And the bakery, they said, no, we don't want to design the gay wedding cake.
[03:35:12.856 --> 03:35:14.736]  It became a national suit, national story.
[03:35:14.736 --> 03:35:18.577]  ACLU got involved, said you cannot discriminate if you're a private business.
[03:35:18.577 --> 03:35:19.817]  So that was a big deal.
[03:35:19.817 --> 03:35:25.238]  And even back then, I think most conservatives said, no, you can't do that.
[03:35:25.238 --> 03:35:26.459]  That's not free speech.
[03:35:26.459 --> 03:35:34.440]  So it was then, I think, when we started to see the left kind of go to anti-free speech, and now the right being the party or the side of free speech in this country.
[03:35:34.440 --> 03:35:36.661]  That's like a flip from the 70s, like a reversal.
[03:35:38.681 --> 03:35:41.023]  But how is it that the ACLU can look in the mirror?
[03:35:41.023 --> 03:35:42.604]  I mean, these are attorneys.
[03:35:42.604 --> 03:35:43.985]  They've passed the bar.
[03:35:43.985 --> 03:35:52.871]  I mean, they can go and practice in a court of law, but yet they're going to say that businesses do not have a license to discriminate and then ignore all the discrimination happening against conservatives.
[03:35:52.871 --> 03:36:05.380]  One of the great tragedies in civil rights law over the past five years has been the complete decline of the ACLU from being, I mean, I remember growing up as a kid and my conservative friends called them the American Commie Loving Union and the Anti-Christian Liberties Union and all the rest.
[03:36:05.640 --> 03:36:10.123]  But I was a champion of the ACLU because the ACLU was a champion of the First Amendment.
[03:36:10.123 --> 03:36:14.426]  And now what's happened is the ACLU has abandoned that to become SJW occupied.
[03:36:14.426 --> 03:36:20.789]  To have these sort of young lawyers who have grown up in a political culture that believes in safe space is not the First Amendment to the United States.
[03:36:20.789 --> 03:36:27.994]  The only safe space for democracy, the only safe space for thought, the only safe space for idea is the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
[03:36:28.354 --> 03:36:37.142]  And those ideas of free speech, those ideas of free press are cultural values that we share across the political and ideological spectrum in America's history.
[03:36:37.142 --> 03:36:42.767]  And that means respecting them and protecting them even in the private workspace to the degree that's practicable or achievable.
[03:36:42.767 --> 03:36:51.154]  And so here where you have a public monopoly that has effectively a public monopoly over the public square, even though they're a private company,
[03:36:51.534 --> 03:36:57.401]  Historically, we've understood that to be someone who has the same obligations under the First Amendment as anyone else.
[03:36:57.401 --> 03:37:00.405]  At a minimum, they have the same obligations as any publisher.
[03:37:00.405 --> 03:37:10.878]  And yet, right now, because of a combination of Section 230 and the Supreme Court abdicating its duties and obligations, and this disparate discriminatory use of when private businesses are subject to discrimination laws,
[03:37:11.578 --> 03:37:14.821]  Where, if you're conservative, you are, but if you're liberal, you're not.
[03:37:14.821 --> 03:37:24.368]  Then the net effect of it is that we have a situation where the public square is being monopolized, and even though it's being monetized by these private companies for their personal gain and profit... Billions.
[03:37:24.368 --> 03:37:37.118]  Billions and billions of dollars, it's now being monopolized for thought control, for speech control, for idea control, to such a degree that it's no longer just about, does Alex Jones or InfoWars or Owen Schroer have access to speak their mind?
[03:37:37.118 --> 03:37:38.199]  It's, can you talk about them?
[03:37:38.519 --> 03:37:40.760]  I'm like, right now it's Alex Jones at InfoWars.
[03:37:40.760 --> 03:37:43.282]  Tomorrow it's going to be, and Paul Joseph, well, it's there.
[03:37:43.282 --> 03:37:48.045]  Then it's going to be Paul Joseph Watson and Owen Schroyer, and it's going to be a bunch of David Knight and a bunch of other people.
[03:37:48.045 --> 03:37:49.345]  And they're not going to stop there.
[03:37:49.345 --> 03:37:52.067]  Does anybody really think they're going to stop with InfoWars?
[03:37:52.067 --> 03:37:58.210]  InfoWars happens to be one of the most effective independent press organizations in the world, but they're not going to stop at the most effective.
[03:37:58.210 --> 03:38:07.456]  If they can achieve suppression and censorship of this speech, if they can get customers and supporters and the audience to not be involved, not be connected, not share links, not talk about it,
[03:38:07.836 --> 03:38:09.918]  Then they can be effective against anybody.
[03:38:09.918 --> 03:38:17.604]  That's why they've chosen Alex Jones and Infowars as the tip of the spear, as the initial target, as the template, as the example for future use.
[03:38:17.604 --> 03:38:20.947]  And it's going to keep going, and it's going to keep rolling, and it's not going to stop.
[03:38:20.947 --> 03:38:25.811]  This is the most fundamental time that our First Amendment liberties are at risk.
[03:38:25.811 --> 03:38:28.453]  More so even than in World War I or World War II or Civil War.
[03:38:28.453 --> 03:38:33.317]  Whenever we've had war, there's been a historic use or misuse of the free speech laws to try to suppress it or censor it.
[03:38:33.837 --> 03:38:41.884]  But now we're talking about systematic control of speech by private companies acting outside of the constitutional limitation and against its purposes and intentions.
[03:38:41.884 --> 03:38:48.209]  And if that Chinese social credit model becomes the American model, we're a techopoly, not a democracy.
[03:38:48.209 --> 03:38:48.989]  And where does this end?
[03:38:49.810 --> 03:38:52.212]  Where does censorship end?
[03:38:52.212 --> 03:38:56.736]  Is it going to come to a point where I have to be, like, hiding in a cave to listen to Alex Jones?
[03:38:56.736 --> 03:39:01.701]  Like, I have to get off the grid to even go to Infowars.com, or are they going to come after me?
[03:39:01.701 --> 03:39:13.011]  They're literally, it's like people who watch the movie The Matrix, and these big tech people, you know, Red Orwell, Red Huxley, watch The Matrix, and they thought, not, that's a world to fear, that's a world to oppose, we want to be Neo, we want to be the red pill.
[03:39:13.411 --> 03:39:15.732]  No, it was, man, everybody should take the blue pill.
[03:39:15.732 --> 03:39:17.693]  In fact, we need to create a world that looks like the Matrix.
[03:39:17.693 --> 03:39:19.194]  And that's basically what they're creating.
[03:39:19.194 --> 03:39:22.856]  To where you're so scared and so afraid, they're getting people to self-censor.
[03:39:22.856 --> 03:39:27.819]  So the goal is not just, hey, whenever you say Alex Jones' name now on social media, we're going to censor you.
[03:39:27.819 --> 03:39:30.621]  I mean, what's happening now is people are simply sharing photographs.
[03:39:31.221 --> 03:39:35.606]  Photographs of them and other people with Alex, with Paul Joseph Watson, with other people.
[03:39:35.606 --> 03:39:39.529]  And they were told to not only remove the photos or the... Oh, that was stunning!
[03:39:39.529 --> 03:39:43.614]  Just somebody who had selfies, basically, with Laura Loomer and Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:39:43.614 --> 03:39:45.495]  They had their photos removed.
[03:39:45.495 --> 03:39:48.418]  But here's the thing that I wonder, too, because that's a perfect analogy.
[03:39:49.099 --> 03:39:52.300]  It's like, do they realize they are the bad guys in the Matrix?
[03:39:52.300 --> 03:39:54.942]  Like, do they realize they're the bad guys in 1984?
[03:39:54.942 --> 03:39:56.182]  Like, they're the ones bringing that?
[03:39:56.182 --> 03:39:57.923]  It's like, I think that they like it though.
[03:39:57.923 --> 03:39:59.464]  There's something sick that they like it.
[03:39:59.464 --> 03:40:07.467]  And then, like you said too, I noticed, and this was kind of the original self-censorship, there's a lot of great journalists out there, but they will never come on InfoWars.
[03:40:07.467 --> 03:40:08.328]  And you know why.
[03:40:08.328 --> 03:40:08.488]  Yes.
[03:40:09.188 --> 03:40:09.608]  Oh, precisely.
[03:40:09.608 --> 03:40:17.629]  I mean, it's this, it's, what I was told, for example, there are other lawyers and there are other people to be careful about representing InfoWars and representing Alex.
[03:40:17.629 --> 03:40:18.510]  Yeah, you gotta be careful.
[03:40:18.510 --> 03:40:20.530]  Don't go on InfoWars like, oh, you're bad now.
[03:40:20.530 --> 03:40:20.830]  Exactly.
[03:40:20.830 --> 03:40:24.931]  I mean, you're going to be politically attacked, you're going to be economically attacked, you're going to be professionally attacked.
[03:40:24.931 --> 03:40:26.551]  It's already happening.
[03:40:26.551 --> 03:40:37.093]  You have people trying to kick me out of cases, people trying to remove me from cases, people trying to defame me in other ways, all just because I'm doing my job and doing my advocacy and doing my own First Amendment.
[03:40:37.093 --> 03:40:37.933]  Lawyers, and it's like...
[03:40:38.493 --> 03:40:39.654]  Lawyers!
[03:40:39.654 --> 03:40:40.994]  Murderers get lawyers!
[03:40:40.994 --> 03:40:41.575]  Like, what is it?
[03:40:41.575 --> 03:40:42.595]  Rapists get lawyers!
[03:40:42.595 --> 03:40:45.136]  I mean, it's like... So, of course!
[03:40:45.136 --> 03:40:45.897]  Well, I mean, look at it.
[03:40:45.897 --> 03:40:50.479]  There's a Fundamentals of the United States Supreme Court case, 1991, Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada.
[03:40:50.479 --> 03:40:55.541]  And what happened, what he did is really, you know, was arguably scandalous, but in fact was important for him to do for his client.
[03:40:55.541 --> 03:40:56.662]  Client gets indicted.
[03:40:56.662 --> 03:41:04.866]  He comes out and says, the prosecutor's corrupt, and they should have indicted the corrupt cops who completely framed my client, and he's being used as a scapegoat.
[03:41:04.866 --> 03:41:06.907]  And he was just a few months away from jury trial at that time.
[03:41:07.447 --> 03:41:11.128]  So that was, if anything was scurrilous or scandalous, that was.
[03:41:11.128 --> 03:41:11.308]  U.S.
[03:41:11.308 --> 03:41:16.470]  Supreme Court unanimously comes in and says that's completely protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
[03:41:16.470 --> 03:41:23.251]  Not only that, the famous quote, it said, the duty of an attorney does not start at the inside of the courtroom door.
[03:41:23.251 --> 03:41:32.294]  It starts in the courtroom of the public opinion, where part of your duty, your obligation, your ethical duty, your ethical obligation to your client is to advocate in the court of public opinion why the case shouldn't be here.
[03:41:32.734 --> 03:41:49.471]  So the fact that people are saying not only should InfoWars not have free speech to talk about its ideas of things in the past, not only should Alex Jones not have free speech to talk about his opinions about things, but the lawyers shouldn't even have free speech and free press to talk about defending Alex Jones in the courts of law and the court of public opinion.
[03:41:49.471 --> 03:41:56.018]  Which again, so now they're not only attacking the First Amendment, they're attacking your right to an attorney, they're attacking your right to a fair trial!
[03:41:56.158 --> 03:42:03.886]  Precisely, they're trying to dictate who you can pick as your lawyer, trying to dictate what your lawyer can say in public, trying to dictate what your lawyer can say in court.
[03:42:03.886 --> 03:42:06.029]  It's frightening, and it's very Orwellian.
[03:42:06.029 --> 03:42:09.092]  So, I mean, in terms of your question, where does it ultimately go?
[03:42:09.092 --> 03:42:15.419]  It goes to a place where we're not allowed to think our own thoughts, we're not allowed to express our own ideas, we're not allowed to share our own ideas.
[03:42:15.419 --> 03:42:16.720]  I mean, here you have Facebook.
[03:42:16.840 --> 03:42:20.141]  Just two days ago, said, hey, let's bring everybody into the living room.
[03:42:20.141 --> 03:42:22.642]  Let's create a digital living room in your space.
[03:42:22.642 --> 03:42:24.262]  And these will be private chats.
[03:42:24.262 --> 03:42:27.023]  In fact, as exact words were, we're going to bring back privacy.
[03:42:27.023 --> 03:42:33.605]  Well, let's actually talk about the difference here between a small-time bakery and these tech giants and where the difference is.
[03:42:33.605 --> 03:42:40.307]  But here's the incredible thing, because I was actually talking to someone recently, and they were like, hey, you're talking a lot differently than you were like an hour ago.
[03:42:40.307 --> 03:42:42.408]  And I was like, guess how many phones are in this room now?
[03:42:43.448 --> 03:42:44.949]  And they were like, oh.
[03:42:44.949 --> 03:42:47.931]  And I was like, yeah, dude, that phone is literally listening to you.
[03:42:47.931 --> 03:42:49.592]  So better watch out what you say.
[03:42:49.592 --> 03:42:50.812]  But they tell you they're listening now.
[03:42:50.812 --> 03:42:52.974]  At least they're honest about it.
[03:42:52.974 --> 03:43:02.259]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:43:02.259 --> 03:43:05.140]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:43:05.140 --> 03:43:11.184]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:43:11.844 --> 03:43:18.107]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:43:18.107 --> 03:43:24.371]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:43:24.371 --> 03:43:31.334]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:43:32.475 --> 03:43:45.507]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:43:45.507 --> 03:43:49.751]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:43:49.751 --> 03:43:53.174]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[03:43:53.174 --> 03:43:56.237]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[03:43:56.237 --> 03:43:57.799]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[03:43:59.166 --> 03:44:02.111]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.

[03:46:57.056 --> 03:46:59.738]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.657 --> 03:47:17.885]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:47:17.885 --> 03:47:22.657]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[03:47:26.420 --> 03:47:28.921]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:28.921 --> 03:47:32.482]  Robert Barnes in studio with this final segment here on this Friday.
[03:47:32.482 --> 03:47:37.264]  In fact, we're gonna have a couple special broadcasts live this weekend as well.
[03:47:37.264 --> 03:47:40.726]  So be sure to tune in to Infowars.com slash show over the weekend.
[03:47:40.726 --> 03:47:42.446]  I'll just leave it there.
[03:47:42.446 --> 03:47:47.108]  I got two big questions for Robert Barnes here as we close us out in regards to the censorship.
[03:47:47.108 --> 03:47:51.130]  Now we were discussing this off-air, but the big difference, I think this is obvious now,
[03:47:52.600 --> 03:48:06.891]  I'm not sure what type of investigations are going on, what type of information Trump has, or other people might have, but I think it's safe to assume that these big tech companies, Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, have gotten government contracts somewhere down the road.
[03:48:06.891 --> 03:48:08.432]  What we would call black contracts.
[03:48:08.432 --> 03:48:14.257]  You're not going to see them, you're not going to hear about them, but they're there, and it's for, you know, quote-unquote security purposes, we'll say.
[03:48:14.257 --> 03:48:15.778]  So say, let's say then,
[03:48:17.085 --> 03:48:21.247]  That Twitter or Facebook or YouTube has some sort of government contract.
[03:48:21.247 --> 03:48:25.849]  Well, some small-time bakery in Colorado doesn't have a government contract.
[03:48:25.849 --> 03:48:32.411]  But, what we saw happen is the ACLU, everybody got involved, they tell the baker, you have to bake this gay cake, he cannot discriminate.
[03:48:32.411 --> 03:48:42.676]  So, if you apply that same logic, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube cannot discriminate against conservatives, which they're so clearly doing, they've been caught on, you know, undercover cameras admitting all this.
[03:48:43.456 --> 03:48:48.918]  Okay, so maybe you'll say, like the ACLU said in 2012, private businesses have the right to discriminate.
[03:48:48.918 --> 03:48:52.358]  Which I would actually think that that's a fair argument to have.
[03:48:52.358 --> 03:48:56.860]  But if they're getting government contracts, does that change the game?
[03:48:56.860 --> 03:48:57.780]  Change rules?
[03:48:57.780 --> 03:48:58.200]  Absolutely.
[03:48:58.200 --> 03:49:00.681]  You compare the baker to Facebook.
[03:49:00.681 --> 03:49:04.002]  The baker is not offering a platform for public communication.
[03:49:04.002 --> 03:49:06.242]  The baker is simply making cakes.
[03:49:06.242 --> 03:49:07.222]  And that was the point that the U.S.
[03:49:07.222 --> 03:49:08.043]  Supreme Court made.
[03:49:08.043 --> 03:49:11.324]  The baker is not required to offer a platform for publication of speech.
[03:49:12.984 --> 03:49:14.365]  That's precisely what Facebook is.
[03:49:14.365 --> 03:49:18.167]  Facebook provides a platform for the publication of speech.
[03:49:18.167 --> 03:49:22.029]  So that makes it very different, legally, from the Baker.
[03:49:22.029 --> 03:49:25.391]  The second aspect is they are a federal contract recipient.
[03:49:25.391 --> 03:49:29.814]  And so once you saw the president go out and say that because colleges and universities receive federal funds,
[03:49:30.314 --> 03:49:31.035]  I forgot about that.
[03:49:31.035 --> 03:49:37.419]  Trump already made the initiative with colleges to stop the attack on free speech because they're getting, you know, government stimulus, obviously.
[03:49:55.390 --> 03:49:55.730]  Exactly.
[03:49:55.730 --> 03:49:58.413]  That same practice principle can be applied to social media.
[03:49:58.413 --> 03:49:58.733]  Precisely.
[03:49:58.733 --> 03:49:59.755]  He can do that tomorrow.
[03:49:59.755 --> 03:50:14.410]  Tomorrow he can go out and say, anybody that is involved in the social media space or provides a platform for the publication of either private press or private speech of any kind, cannot discriminate on a viewpoint basis if they receive any federal funding of any kind.
[03:50:14.410 --> 03:50:17.413]  And that's every single major social media giant that exists.
[03:50:18.373 --> 03:50:21.594]  So effectively, that would require them to enforce it tomorrow.
[03:50:21.594 --> 03:50:23.914]  So that's the second big distinction between them.
[03:50:23.914 --> 03:50:25.535]  The third big distinction that the U.S.
[03:50:25.535 --> 03:50:44.859]  Supreme Court has drawn in the past, that the California Supreme Court has drawn repeatedly, and that and all of these big tech giants are located in California, so governed by California law, is that if they choose to become a public monopoly, if they choose to monopolize the public square, then they have obligations that are different than someone who does not monopolize the public square.
[03:50:45.279 --> 03:50:49.541]  So the equivalent would be, let's say you're in the public square, but you have just one little corner of it.
[03:50:49.541 --> 03:50:53.723]  Well, you're not under the same obligation as somebody who owns the entire public square.
[03:50:53.723 --> 03:51:10.650]  Once you own the public square and you want the benefits of that monopoly, a monopoly you acquired through special congressional immunity in section 230, a benefit you, a monopoly you acquired by lying to people about promising to protect free speech, then you should be obligated to keep your promises and be obligated, just like any governmental entity.
[03:51:10.650 --> 03:51:12.711]  So would that be like saying, Twitter
[03:51:13.391 --> 03:51:18.752]  He owns the public square of Twitter, so therefore they have to allow anybody on there.
[03:51:18.752 --> 03:51:24.394]  But, once you get on there, say Donald Trump, you can block whoever you want.
[03:51:24.394 --> 03:51:33.196]  You can have terms of service that allow different, like right now it's interestingly enough, they have said that, the courts have said, under First Amendment standards, the President can't block anyone.
[03:51:33.196 --> 03:51:36.697]  So it's ironic, the President can't block anyone on Twitter, but Twitter can.
[03:51:36.997 --> 03:51:38.178]  Twitter can block whomever they want.
[03:51:38.178 --> 03:51:39.739]  This doesn't really make sense.
[03:51:39.739 --> 03:51:50.065]  That we have the ultimate censor, the ultimate controller, suppressor of speech, already surveilling people's speech, and intruding and invading on their privacy on a regular basis.
[03:51:50.065 --> 03:51:59.310]  So if we're going to make this meaningful, Twitter basically says, if you want to be Twitter, and you in that particular form of social media space, like they have Gab and other competitors, but they have 90-95% of that space.
[03:52:01.051 --> 03:52:01.311]  Of course!
[03:52:22.076 --> 03:52:29.357]  They're never going to plug Bridie on, they're never going to plug Mines, they're never going to plug Swiss Cows, they're never going to plug DuckDuckGo, so that's how they have total control.
[03:52:29.357 --> 03:52:35.059]  Exactly, and so when people say, oh, just go out there and create your own, that is not an effective alternative in the economic space.
[03:52:35.059 --> 03:52:38.419]  It would be like saying in the railroad era, well, go out and do your own railroad.
[03:52:38.419 --> 03:52:46.541]  Well, that's just not going to work, because the best railroad tracks have already been laid, the best railroad tracks have already been established, the best railroads already exist, so you're not going to be able to meaningfully compete with them.
[03:52:46.681 --> 03:52:46.921]  I think so.
[03:53:03.220 --> 03:53:17.124]  It's the same thing that the California court said in the Pruner decision about shopping malls and the public area component of shopping malls, that if you're going to benefit and profit from monopolizing the public square, you should be under the same obligations as the First Amendment.
[03:53:17.124 --> 03:53:24.305]  And that doesn't stop you from including in your terms of service compliance standards that prohibit obscenity, prohibit stalking, prohibit harassing.
[03:53:24.305 --> 03:53:26.706]  All those things are outside First Amendment protection.
[03:53:26.706 --> 03:53:30.107]  It's just incorporate the First Amendment, don't engage in viewpoint discrimination,
[03:53:30.527 --> 03:53:30.787]  I think so.
[03:53:48.923 --> 03:53:49.383]  And that's why
[03:54:14.429 --> 03:54:24.912]  You know, the Jack Dorsey's and the Mark Zuckerberg's are the jewel in the eye of the Obama types because they know they have that control and that's an ultimate power to them to shut down free speech.
[03:54:24.912 --> 03:54:26.292]  That's what a tyrant wants.
[03:54:26.292 --> 03:54:27.433]  They need to shut down free speech.
[03:54:27.433 --> 03:54:28.433]  I mean, look at China.
[03:54:28.433 --> 03:54:29.253]  All right, final question.
[03:54:29.253 --> 03:54:30.313]  We've got three minutes left here.
[03:54:30.313 --> 03:54:32.974]  So this is what people are saying.
[03:54:32.974 --> 03:54:40.036]  And I mean, you have to probably do a lot of the math and crunch the data for this, but it could be, you know, people want to know
[03:54:41.320 --> 03:54:55.273]  Would it be viable, or would it be, like could you basically, could Alex Jones crush the numbers from the Google censorship and everything, look at it all, and then in a defamation suit, sue for a billion dollars?
[03:54:55.273 --> 03:54:59.017]  These days, when you look at the kind of lawsuits that have been filed, the amounts of money being around,
[03:54:59.537 --> 03:55:05.064]  He would have a potential claim, particularly if he brings what I think is under consideration as a class action.
[03:55:05.064 --> 03:55:06.546]  Brings it on behalf of everybody.
[03:55:06.546 --> 03:55:15.136]  Brings it that this is a common pattern, common practice, common targeting, and bring it on behalf of Laura Loomer, bring it on behalf of Paul Watson, bring it on behalf of a wide range of people.
[03:55:15.136 --> 03:55:17.419]  Or all the people that share our videos and they get banned.
[03:55:17.419 --> 03:55:17.840]  Exactly.
[03:55:18.120 --> 03:55:22.103]  Bring it on behalf of all ordinary everyday people who no longer have free speech and free press.
[03:55:22.103 --> 03:55:29.348]  And he's willing to be the tip of the spear, willing to be the front of the operation, willing to help raise the funds to make it a meaningful suit that can be effective.
[03:55:29.348 --> 03:55:35.113]  We will bring in all the best legal team across the country to achieve it, much like we're doing in the Covington cases.
[03:55:35.113 --> 03:55:42.138]  So the effect would be to go after him, and they could clearly, it could re-script the entire landscape of speech and press in America.
[03:55:42.478 --> 03:55:51.908]  Now the hard part is it's getting it through judges that are going to be the court systems that have to date believe immunity is so broad that they're not supposed to hold big tech responsible or accountable.
[03:55:51.908 --> 03:55:59.576]  But maybe now this is the only time and the only opportunity to do so because otherwise we're not going to have free press or free speech in America moving forward.
[03:55:59.576 --> 03:56:00.777]  Well and I think that they see
[03:56:01.778 --> 03:56:10.007]  With 2020 getting closer, I mean, I don't know, everyday I'm convinced that I don't even realize how delusional these people are.
[03:56:10.007 --> 03:56:16.335]  So they might actually think they can pull something off here with the social media censorship and maybe somehow take
[03:56:17.576 --> 03:56:18.697]  Absolutely.
[03:56:18.697 --> 03:56:22.220]  I mean, the logical thing to do, there was a great professor, Professor Epstein, did a study.
[03:56:22.220 --> 03:56:30.447]  His survey was that 2018 may have been the outcome of manipulation of news stories by the AI algorithms of Facebook, YouTube, Google, and Twitter.
[03:56:30.447 --> 03:56:36.532]  So imagine what they can do in 2020 if they can make sure that the best, most effective voices out there
[03:56:36.932 --> 03:56:40.394]  Are not heard and can't even be spoken, can't even be talked about.
[03:56:40.394 --> 03:56:42.975]  I mean, literally, they think Alex Jones has the power of Voldemort.
[03:56:42.975 --> 03:56:48.158]  And people love their social media accounts, so they're like, oh, well, I'm not going to do it then.
[03:56:48.158 --> 03:56:49.499]  I want to keep my social media.
[03:56:49.499 --> 03:56:49.879]  Exactly.
[03:56:49.879 --> 03:56:51.380]  Then that's the goal and that's the objective.
[03:56:51.380 --> 03:56:56.282]  And if they can achieve that, then they'll be able to dictate the outcome of the election, because they've already done from political surveys.
[03:56:56.282 --> 03:56:58.264]  Professor Epstein and others have looked at it.
[03:56:58.264 --> 03:57:04.347]  You can completely dictate the outcome of an election just by manipulating the what stories people see on social media alone.
[03:57:04.347 --> 03:57:04.667]  Just that.
[03:57:04.827 --> 03:57:16.875]  And I feel that there's a large portion of the country that doesn't really take this seriously because, and it is the older generations, because they didn't grow up with social media, but that's the key here, is they are targeting the younger generations.
[03:57:16.875 --> 03:57:20.277]  This is what they want the younger generations to get up used to.
[03:57:20.277 --> 03:57:22.019]  Oh yeah, censorship here?
[03:57:22.019 --> 03:57:22.979]  That's normal.
[03:57:22.979 --> 03:57:24.300]  No, that's not normal.
[03:57:24.300 --> 03:57:25.421]  And so that's why we have to fight it.
[03:57:25.421 --> 03:57:27.762]  Robert Barnes, always doing great stuff.
[03:57:27.762 --> 03:57:32.746]  You can follow him at BarnesLaw on Twitter, until they'll probably find a way to ban him next.
[03:57:32.746 --> 03:57:33.766]  We'll all be banned!
[03:57:34.667 --> 03:57:36.271]  They're gonna have to ban themselves, probably.
[03:57:36.271 --> 03:57:38.577]  Alright, I'm gonna take over the War Room here.
[03:57:38.577 --> 03:57:39.459]  I'm gonna switch studios.
[03:57:39.459 --> 03:57:40.461]  We're gonna take your phone calls.
[03:57:40.461 --> 03:57:42.727]  Great guests coming up on the warroominfowars.com slash show.
[03:57:43.843 --> 03:57:51.189]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[03:57:51.189 --> 03:57:54.251]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[03:57:54.251 --> 03:57:55.892]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[03:57:55.892 --> 03:57:58.574]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[03:57:58.574 --> 03:58:00.055]  You're our only sponsors.
[03:58:00.055 --> 03:58:06.540]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[03:58:06.540 --> 03:58:08.502]  So remember, you are the InfoWarrant.
[03:58:09.022 --> 03:58:10.043]  I'm not the leader.
[03:58:10.043 --> 03:58:10.843]  You are the leader.
[03:58:10.843 --> 03:58:12.805]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[03:58:12.805 --> 03:58:18.229]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.
[03:58:18.229 --> 03:58:25.674]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[03:58:25.674 --> 03:58:26.995]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[03:58:27.375 --> 03:58:28.776]  I want to encourage you again.
[03:58:28.776 --> 03:58:33.699]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[03:58:33.699 --> 03:58:36.841]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[03:58:36.841 --> 03:58:38.963]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[03:58:38.963 --> 03:58:45.107]  God bless you.
[03:58:45.107 --> 03:58:46.568]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:58:46.568 --> 03:58:48.469]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:58:48.469 --> 03:58:49.070]  It is!
[03:58:49.070 --> 03:58:50.631]  But if you took it with bish oil...
[03:58:51.896 --> 03:58:53.938]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[03:58:53.938 --> 03:58:55.279]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:58:55.279 --> 03:58:57.101]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:58:57.101 --> 03:58:59.583]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:58:59.583 --> 03:59:01.224]  Brain, body, heart.
[03:59:01.224 --> 03:59:02.666]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[03:59:02.666 --> 03:59:04.047]  You've got the children's.
[03:59:04.047 --> 03:59:05.148]  You've got the adults.
[03:59:05.148 --> 03:59:06.169]  You've got the krill oil.
[03:59:06.169 --> 03:59:09.552]  If you're gonna get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[03:59:09.552 --> 03:59:10.913]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil.
[03:59:10.913 --> 03:59:12.675]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:59:35.384 --> 03:59:41.411]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:59:41.411 --> 03:59:47.118]  I just can't do it!
[03:59:47.118 --> 03:59:49.721]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
