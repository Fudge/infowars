[00:00:03.394 --> 00:00:06.038]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:11.166]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:32.248 --> 00:00:38.592]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a World Exclusive with Roger Stone coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:00:38.592 --> 00:00:39.853]  He's on the line right now.
[00:00:39.853 --> 00:00:52.481]  In fact, we have the World Exclusive, his response to Mueller putting out a request for a Star Chamber, where the trial will be secret.
[00:00:53.706 --> 00:00:58.472]  So the public can't see how kangaroo it is, according to many people's concerns.
[00:00:58.472 --> 00:01:06.583]  This judge has been very kangaroo-ish before, giving Mueller whatever he wants, gagging people, not letting them defend themselves, not letting them even raise money for their defense.
[00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:09.046]  I mean, we're talking Soviet-level type stuff.
[00:01:10.027 --> 00:01:17.952]  That was going to be big news, and he should have covered it at the start of the next segment, but you'll definitely have a Don or somebody email Drudge, who's been very gracious.
[00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:21.854]  This is big news, to pick up the last two exclusive interviews with Roger.
[00:01:21.854 --> 00:01:28.098]  This could be his last interview before going in at 2 o'clock today, Eastern, where he may be gagged.
[00:01:28.098 --> 00:01:29.418]  Yes, it's un-American.
[00:01:29.418 --> 00:01:32.480]  Yes, it's unprecedented, but it's what this judge has been doing.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.721]  And InfoWars will fight it.
[00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:35.322]  Let me also announce we're going to file a lawsuit.
[00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:39.828]  Uh, if, uh, they try to keep the press out.
[00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:42.189]  The press always files lawsuits when things like this happen.
[00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.110]  They're usually successful.
[00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.350]  Don't tell it this time.
[00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.551]  The press is the murderer of truth now.
[00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:50.493]  The mainstream press, they want the news shut down.
[00:01:50.493 --> 00:01:58.576]  Well, Roger just learned from his lawyers and just learned from security cameras and just confirmed he's going to be a world exclusive.
[00:01:59.793 --> 00:02:07.678]  In fact, I know the crew is in there watching and listening right now, but we probably need to go ahead and change the headline on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:15.865]  Also guys, please print me the New York Times article where the president praises Roger Stone.
[00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:18.808]  That's one thing I forgot to get here in my stack.
[00:02:18.808 --> 00:02:24.432]  So a lot of times I'm so busy before I get on air, this first five minutes is kind of us organizing things.
[00:02:24.432 --> 00:02:30.857]  You're watching how the sausage is getting made because things are breaking up to the minute.
[00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:37.742]  But when we come back, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone has the proof that CNN broke the law
[00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:59.613]  And that CNN was specifically told by the FBI to be there, and that they set up 30 minutes before, pulling their cameras right at his door, in another example of how they are nothing but a propaganda bureau of the Deep State, and the Globalist, and any other foreign government like the Chinese, or Qatar, or Saudi Arabia, that pay them money.
[00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:05.555]  So, that is all coming up as well, after this quick break.
[00:03:05.555 --> 00:03:06.756]  In other news today,
[00:03:08.693 --> 00:03:21.187]  The New York Times is reporting on award-winning journalist and witnesses admitting to spreading HIV and so-called inoculations to Africans as part of a bioweapons program.
[00:03:21.187 --> 00:03:25.872]  And guess the name of the CIA operative who admits to it?
[00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.195]  Alexander Jones, no relation to me.
[00:03:29.454 --> 00:03:37.299]  Truth is stranger than fiction, CIA-backed mercenaries spread HIV in South Africa, ex-member claims.
[00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.781]  So, that is all coming up.
[00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:43.143]  Of course, that's what my dad always told me, that HIV was actually introduced in the 60s.
[00:03:43.143 --> 00:03:46.966]  It's race-specific for Africans.
[00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:50.088]  It can kill others, but it's more deadly in blacks, obviously.
[00:03:50.088 --> 00:03:51.809]  Easier to spread.
[00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:56.553]  Whites don't even have the receptor sites on their T-lymphocytes to take in the virus.
[00:03:57.642 --> 00:04:02.106]  But basically a black person just gets touched by an HIV virus.
[00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:03.407]  It's bye-bye.
[00:04:03.407 --> 00:04:06.329]  It's terrible, but you're not going to hear any black leaders warning you about that.
[00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.252]  They want to make sure you get aborted before you ever get out of your mommy.
[00:04:10.252 --> 00:04:16.317]  So we're going to be going over all that.
[00:04:16.317 --> 00:04:19.139]  So that is all coming up as well.
[00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.342]  And then there's those type of stories that catch everybody's attention.
[00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:37.942]  There's those type of stories that really crystallize things and really allow people to understand what's going on and what's happening.
[00:04:37.942 --> 00:04:40.083]  And that's one of these right here.
[00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:48.630]  We're going to get to after Roger leaves us where over the different security cameras and Amazon systems, hackers are trying to kill people's babies.
[00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:56.355]  Burn people's houses down and talking smack to their husbands and wives.
[00:04:56.355 --> 00:04:56.996]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:57.417]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:06.093]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:05:06.093 --> 00:05:12.515]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[00:06:04.822 --> 00:06:16.829]  We're good to go.
[00:06:31.403 --> 00:06:32.544]  Big Brother.
[00:06:32.544 --> 00:06:34.305]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:34.305 --> 00:06:36.207]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:36.207 --> 00:06:37.908]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:37.908 --> 00:06:39.590]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.293]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:02.570]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:10.392]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Friday, February 1st, 2019 global broadcast and we're joined by Roger Stone exclusively.
[00:07:10.392 --> 00:07:24.477]  He's not talking to any other media today because they fear that he may be gagged by the same judge that magically is getting all the Mueller cases and who has gagged other individuals and then also not allowed them to fundraise.
[00:07:25.501 --> 00:07:29.325]  A new level of draconian oppression.
[00:07:29.325 --> 00:07:33.449]  So Roger has not been unable to have press conferences.
[00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:39.575]  Roger has been unable to go out in public because he gets physically attacked and shouted down.
[00:07:39.575 --> 00:07:44.419]  So this is the place here at Infowars where he is able to do that and will be doing that.
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:56.571]  Now Mueller's also announced a protective order that turns the court into a star chamber so that no media can be there and so only Mueller and his people can leak out whatever disinformation they want.
[00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:57.912]  So that's a tactic they've been using.
[00:07:57.912 --> 00:08:04.097]  Now that was going to be the big exclusive news and we're going to get into that with Roger here in the next segment.
[00:08:04.838 --> 00:08:16.262]  But right now, ladies and gentlemen, the huge exclusive that's going to get them in hot water is what Roger Stone is about to break down concerning CNN being tipped off to that raid and then caught lying about it.
[00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:20.783]  That is a felony for the FBI to have leaked that to the media.
[00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:24.005]  Also, it shows that the raid was not needed if Stone's so deadly.
[00:08:24.005 --> 00:08:26.045]  Why would they let CNN be there?
[00:08:26.045 --> 00:08:30.567]  Why would they then shut the street down around CNN, allowing them to be there?
[00:08:30.567 --> 00:08:33.448]  This is unbelievable breaking
[00:08:34.088 --> 00:08:37.270]  Huge news right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.093]  Absolutely huge news.
[00:08:40.093 --> 00:08:58.326]  And Roger's going to give you the specifics on how he learned it and how bombshell this is, literally hours before he could be judicially silenced so that he can be the sacrificial goat in this whole fake Russiagate witch hunt, now turned into literal inquisition.
[00:08:58.326 --> 00:09:00.788]  Roger Stone, thank you for joining us.
[00:09:00.788 --> 00:09:02.329]  Alex, thank you very much.
[00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:03.170]  First of all,
[00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:18.395]  I want to thank the point I think millions of people who are praying for me because God is powerful and God is my protector and I feel your prayers and I appreciate your prayers.
[00:09:18.395 --> 00:09:25.542]  I also want to thank Alex Jones and InfoWars for providing the infrastructure so I could do a press availability yesterday because
[00:09:26.343 --> 00:09:34.866]  I couldn't speak coming out of the courthouse, which was literally a tsunami, a torrent of hate.
[00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:41.609]  Pushing, shoving, screaming, spitting, pounding on my car, trying to rock my car.
[00:09:41.609 --> 00:09:44.910]  I felt like Vice President Richard Nixon in Caracas in 1958.
[00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.610]  Crazed leftists.
[00:09:48.845 --> 00:10:02.041]  Assaulting my supporters who were there, including several African-American ministers who are friends of mine, who were literally assaulted by crazed leftists.
[00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:07.968]  It was chilling, and I pray for God's protection today as I go to the courthouse.
[00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:23.999]  Because, you know, the death threats have now reached a crescendo and I don't want to, you know, I don't want to be injured or killed in my attempts to adhere to the orders of the court.
[00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:30.261]  The judge has ordered my presence today for a status conference.
[00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:31.341]  We had asked
[00:10:32.191 --> 00:10:36.852]  That I not have to attend because this is really just the lawyers wrangling.
[00:10:36.852 --> 00:10:45.034]  The Mueller team did not object to my not attending, but the judge ordered my attendance anyway, which is her right.
[00:10:45.034 --> 00:10:48.415]  We don't know whether there will be a gag order issued today.
[00:10:48.415 --> 00:10:59.697]  The government has not asked for one, at least not yet, but the judge again has that authority and I would have to adhere to the order of the court and I will, subject obviously to appeal.
[00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:03.993]  But they also entered a protective order.
[00:11:03.993 --> 00:11:07.975]  I don't know all of the aspects of that, and I really cannot discuss it.
[00:11:07.975 --> 00:11:20.520]  But it does, as I understand it, keep the three terabytes, as the media has reported, of data that they turned over confidential.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:29.183]  This, of course, proves what I have said for two years, that my emails, text messages, and phone calls have been entirely monitored and collected.
[00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:45.506]  No answer as to whether that was also true in 2016, as reported by the New York Times, when I believe I was subject to government surveillance during Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
[00:11:45.506 --> 00:11:54.689]  Alex, one of my neighbors has now signed an affidavit because they were walking their dog and they saw the CNN truck.
[00:11:55.606 --> 00:12:03.111]  Pull up and position itself across from my house just 30 minutes before the FBI strike force arrived.
[00:12:03.111 --> 00:12:08.135]  So the idea that I was staked out on a hunch is disproved.
[00:12:08.135 --> 00:12:19.923]  Senator Lindsey Graham is now actively looking into precisely what CNN knew and when it knew it, as are a valiant group of House Republicans.
[00:12:19.923 --> 00:12:23.966]  I believe there's additional evidence that will prove CNN was tipped off.
[00:12:24.835 --> 00:12:38.206]  I do not know definitively that the producer on the ground with the CNN crew is a former Special Assistant to FBI Director James Comey and a former FBI employee.
[00:12:38.206 --> 00:12:52.078]  If I am dangerous, which was the presumption of the raid, even though I did not have a firearm in the house and it did not have a valid passport, so I couldn't get very far if I were a flight risk, which I am not.
[00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:59.507]  Thanks to CNN and MSNBC, I probably have one of the most recognizable faces on the face of the planet.
[00:13:00.311 --> 00:13:02.433]  Why was CNN put in harm's way?
[00:13:02.433 --> 00:13:06.678]  Why were they allowed to be 25 feet from my door?
[00:13:06.678 --> 00:13:09.120]  Well, Roger, let's expand on this.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.422]  This is really scandalous.
[00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:14.325]  It's sensationally corrupt.
[00:13:14.325 --> 00:13:19.130]  Obviously, as I've talked to you about this, there's hardly ever before CNN staked out the house.
[00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:23.434]  Magically, the morning it happens, 30 minutes before,
[00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:32.523]  This guy shows up, sets up, they block off both sides of the street, block off the canal, and then let the CNN reporter sit right there.
[00:13:32.523 --> 00:13:44.976]  I can tell you, with a situation like this, if the police were doing this, the first thing they'd do is come up to a reporter and quietly say, get the hell out of here, and lead him off to the point, where's your vehicle, get in it, leave.
[00:13:45.496 --> 00:13:46.157]  That's what they would do.
[00:13:46.157 --> 00:13:56.945]  They would not just suddenly have him there, 20 feet behind him, supposedly going into El Chapo's lair with 29 people with their assault rifles.
[00:13:56.945 --> 00:14:03.411]  The whole thing was obviously false from the beginning, is fake news, but as Lindsey Graham and others have pointed out, it's illegal.
[00:14:03.931 --> 00:14:06.193]  Well, I trust Senator Graham to get to the bottom of it.
[00:14:06.193 --> 00:14:10.296]  I think there's a great deal more we're going to learn about this setup.
[00:14:28.007 --> 00:14:42.092]  The obvious reason why they wanted CNN to film this is to make me look like public enemy number one, to taint the jury pool and make it appear that I'm guilty before I have a chance to go to trial.
[00:14:42.092 --> 00:14:45.173]  I mean, these are police state tactics.
[00:14:45.173 --> 00:14:53.856]  As the Libertarian Party of Florida said today, police state denies using police state tactics in police state raid on Stone's home.
[00:14:55.345 --> 00:14:57.906]  It's really, you know, it's something I hate to say.
[00:14:57.906 --> 00:15:04.527]  You would see in Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany, the idea that I'm dangerous.
[00:15:04.527 --> 00:15:06.128]  I'm politically dangerous, perhaps.
[00:15:06.128 --> 00:15:10.389]  I'm dangerous with a pen and a microphone, but I am not physically dangerous.
[00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:14.490]  And I've been under investigation for two years.
[00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.731]  They have an enormous amount of data seizing all my electronic equipment.
[00:15:19.406 --> 00:15:23.590]  It was not going to get them anything that they don't already have.
[00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:31.878]  This is more of the show in order, obviously, to pressure me into pleading guilty, which I don't intend to do.
[00:15:31.878 --> 00:15:34.861]  I entered a not guilty plea, as you know.
[00:15:34.861 --> 00:15:39.586]  I have to literally beg people to go to stonedefensefund.com
[00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:48.410]  StoneDefenseFund.com because they have unlimited funds and four platoons of Ivy League left-wing warriors.
[00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.511]  Roger, stay there.
[00:15:49.511 --> 00:15:51.852]  I know you've got to go soon, but this is an exclusive interview on what's happening.
[00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:55.694]  We'll come back and talk about how they've tried to ruin you, now they're trying to gag you.
[00:15:55.694 --> 00:15:57.735]  The so-called press is calling for that.
[00:15:59.332 --> 00:16:02.054]  Bacon lovers, we ship free!

[00:17:04.293 --> 00:17:09.355]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[00:17:09.355 --> 00:17:16.537]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[00:17:16.537 --> 00:17:21.079]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:25.322]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[00:17:25.322 --> 00:17:28.425]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[00:17:28.425 --> 00:17:31.067]  It hit me when I was arrested.

[00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:13.153]  Big Brother.
[00:20:13.153 --> 00:20:14.954]  Mainstream media.
[00:20:14.954 --> 00:20:16.875]  Government cover-ups.
[00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:18.535]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:20:18.535 --> 00:20:20.196]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:20.196 --> 00:20:30.020]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.261]  Lookin' for adventure?
[00:20:32.922 --> 00:20:37.003]  And whatever comes our way!
[00:20:37.003 --> 00:20:48.506]  Ain't nothing gonna make it happen!
[00:20:48.506 --> 00:20:52.207]  Explode into space!
[00:20:52.207 --> 00:20:53.827]  Steppenwolf, that is some good stuff right there.
[00:20:57.415 --> 00:21:00.477]  I remember being about four years old and listening to this.
[00:21:00.477 --> 00:21:10.362]  I was always a big party entertainer at my parents' house to crank up the speakers on the turntable and put on some Rolling Stones or Steppenwolf and start going crazy.
[00:21:10.362 --> 00:21:11.983]  All right, let's get serious.
[00:21:11.983 --> 00:21:16.045]  We've got Roger Stone here with us with Global Exclusives right now.
[00:21:16.045 --> 00:21:21.848]  And I don't know how much of the inside baseball he wants to give out, but it's devastating.
[00:21:21.848 --> 00:21:25.150]  They don't just have the neighbor's affidavit.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:41.062]  Since day one, they thought this was an important piece of information to the public about the deception, the mass media working with Mueller, how the whole thing's synthetic and rigged, how they're seeking to gag Roger and others that they persecuted, and now, um...
[00:21:42.203 --> 00:21:50.732]  Regardless what happens to Roger, obviously I need to talk to you more today, Roger, about, you know, I've got your wife's contact, your daughter, your son, who's a well-spoken sheriff's deputy.
[00:21:50.732 --> 00:21:53.094]  We need to be able to get them ready as spokespersons as well.
[00:21:53.094 --> 00:21:54.936]  They're not going to stop you one way or the other.
[00:21:54.936 --> 00:22:00.642]  I'm going to file a lawsuit, obviously, over these Star Chamber proceedings if the judge grants that, saying it's going to be a secret court.
[00:22:01.042 --> 00:22:04.827]  I mean, this is really just astonishing, astounding, the word you like to use.
[00:22:04.827 --> 00:22:07.390]  This really is epic, un-American garbage.
[00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:15.559]  So just recap, the Star Chamber, the latest though that you can tell people about CNN caught red-handed staging this with the FBI.
[00:22:15.559 --> 00:22:18.503]  Just incredible, jack-boot theater.
[00:22:19.568 --> 00:22:32.179]  Well, you know, CNN continues to maintain the fiction that they were just operating on a hunch, that they just happened to be there, and that a producer just happened to fly from Washington, D.C.
[00:22:32.179 --> 00:22:41.868]  to Fort Lauderdale to bring a full truck and crew to my house, arriving only 30 minutes before the FBI strike force.
[00:22:41.868 --> 00:22:46.612]  If anybody believes that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I want to talk to you about selling.
[00:22:48.182 --> 00:22:52.467]  It just blows the mind, but we see the purpose of it.
[00:22:52.467 --> 00:22:58.294]  It was to humiliate me publicly, to pressure me into pleading guilty to something I didn't do.
[00:22:58.294 --> 00:23:06.785]  I was very gratified to see the President's quote about me in today's New York Times, where he said, he's always liked me, I'm a character.
[00:23:07.726 --> 00:23:16.577]  And that a lot of people respect what I've said about not bearing false witness against him, because Alex, I'm not going to make up lies about the president.
[00:23:16.577 --> 00:23:26.389]  I'm not going to, as I say, bear false witness against him, as I think others have done, just because I am in this politically created bind.
[00:23:28.709 --> 00:23:32.593]  I am not knowledgeable enough to know what will happen in court today.
[00:23:32.593 --> 00:23:42.985]  I would obviously adhere to the orders of the court, subject to my lawyer's recommendations as to how we go forward.
[00:23:42.985 --> 00:23:47.671]  The government has not asked for a gag, but that doesn't mean the judge won't gag me.
[00:23:47.671 --> 00:23:48.412]  She has that right.
[00:23:49.747 --> 00:23:55.568]  But we also have the right of appeal, obviously, at least the right to be heard on the question.
[00:23:55.568 --> 00:23:58.209]  I approach this, you know, soberly.
[00:23:58.209 --> 00:24:05.770]  On the other hand, my greatest concern is that is for my personal safety, the safety of my family.
[00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:15.612]  I can't even imagine, you cannot even imagine the raw hate that we saw outside that courthouse.
[00:24:16.506 --> 00:24:23.312]  I've just never, in 50 years in American politics, I've never experienced anything like that.
[00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:27.842]  And therefore I ask for people's prayers today.
[00:24:27.842 --> 00:24:35.047]  That's right and Roger this is where I wanted to segue in and I asked you to wait to the end of the interview because I wanted to raise this with you and I want to explain something.
[00:24:35.047 --> 00:24:36.187]  Roger's a tough guy.
[00:24:36.187 --> 00:24:37.028]  I'm a tough guy.
[00:24:37.028 --> 00:24:39.510]  We're both under the same crosshairs.
[00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:45.194]  Because they want to shut us down as the precedent for everyone else.
[00:24:45.194 --> 00:24:49.276]  I'll be covering that and some documents that have come out next segment with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:24:49.276 --> 00:24:50.777]  So you have to understand our
[00:24:51.963 --> 00:25:00.389]  Our travails, our dire straits we're in, by choice, is a microcosm of the country.
[00:25:00.389 --> 00:25:07.093]  And these hellish evil bullies and governors saying, I don't apologize, saying we keep babies alive and sell their organs.
[00:25:07.093 --> 00:25:09.695]  You know, he's doubled down.
[00:25:09.695 --> 00:25:15.219]  Or Bill Maher promoting pedophilia between 12-year-old children and 35-year-old adults saying it's love.
[00:25:15.219 --> 00:25:16.520]  They're coming out of the closet.
[00:25:17.674 --> 00:25:24.604]  The evil of the globalists are being spilled out into the land against us.
[00:25:24.604 --> 00:25:33.136]  And so the fact that they try to create a star chamber and not let the media in so they can only leak out this info because their case is so piss fake, piss thin.
[00:25:33.917 --> 00:25:34.817]  Paper thin.
[00:25:34.817 --> 00:25:42.161]  The fact that they've got all these globalist groups shooing us and demonizing us and taking our sponsors and deplatforming us everywhere.
[00:25:42.161 --> 00:25:50.545]  And when I go out on the street, people either love me, which is great, most of them see through it, or they physically want to come after me because the globalists have whipped the public up.
[00:25:51.045 --> 00:25:51.665]  We're good to go.
[00:26:14.455 --> 00:26:16.376]  They're calling for Sharia law.
[00:26:16.376 --> 00:26:21.800]  They're already shutting down swimming pools all over the country for whole days out of the week so Muslims can use it.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.042]  Sharia law is coming into the schools and the lunch programs.
[00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:26.042]  It's here.
[00:26:26.042 --> 00:26:27.783]  We're being drugged through the mud.
[00:26:27.783 --> 00:26:29.824]  Europe's being drugged through the mud.
[00:26:29.824 --> 00:26:34.267]  The Islamists are calling for 90% taxes on the rich, which the rich are offshore.
[00:26:34.267 --> 00:26:35.488]  They're the ones lobbying for it.
[00:26:36.658 --> 00:26:43.563]  This is a criminal takeover and they don't want Roger and I and others to be victorious folk heroes that got Trump in.
[00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:55.451]  They want to destroy us and demonize us, and if they can, we'll then be used, our shrunken heads, stuck on pikes as enemy standards in their army.
[00:26:55.451 --> 00:27:05.554]  So that's why this is like a famous battle that we've got to win, like Trenton, or the battles in Russia, in places like Stalingrad, okay?
[00:27:05.554 --> 00:27:07.414]  We have to win this battle.
[00:27:07.414 --> 00:27:11.895]  This is where the line has to be held, ladies and gentlemen, and the enemy knows it.
[00:27:12.495 --> 00:27:16.096]  That's why all I have to say to you is we need your financial support.
[00:27:16.096 --> 00:27:18.476]  InfoWars has 100 crew members.
[00:27:18.476 --> 00:27:21.297]  We're in the face, still reaching hundreds of millions of people.
[00:27:21.297 --> 00:27:26.018]  We had videos this last week that reached 30, 40 million people that the enemy couldn't stop.
[00:27:26.018 --> 00:27:27.719]  And they're around the clock trying to stop us.
[00:27:27.719 --> 00:27:31.800]  And we need you to go to InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.121]  And we need you to go get the last run of Super Mel Vitality this weekend.
[00:27:35.121 --> 00:27:36.701]  It's the last time it's 50% off.
[00:27:36.701 --> 00:27:38.401]  Our body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:27:38.401 --> 00:27:39.222]  Our turbo force.
[00:27:40.842 --> 00:27:43.224]  The incredible X3.
[00:27:43.224 --> 00:27:46.626]  X2, by the way, it will be sold out by this weekend, the final run.
[00:27:46.626 --> 00:27:48.627]  So it's all there at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:27:48.627 --> 00:27:50.829]  And then by word of mouth, spread the word.
[00:27:50.829 --> 00:27:51.429]  Pray for us.
[00:27:51.429 --> 00:27:52.930]  Thank the local station owners.
[00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:55.091]  And yes, go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:27:55.091 --> 00:27:56.892]  There's other fake ones out there.
[00:27:56.892 --> 00:27:59.034]  I know Roger doesn't have health insurance.
[00:27:59.034 --> 00:28:01.716]  I know he had to sell one of his places.
[00:28:01.716 --> 00:28:06.799]  I know that he only makes a couple hundred thousand dollars a year and lost all his lobbying gigs.
[00:28:07.179 --> 00:28:09.141]  So, again, we are all Roger Stone.
[00:28:09.141 --> 00:28:10.482]  We are all Alex Jones.
[00:28:10.482 --> 00:28:12.123]  That's how the enemy made it.
[00:28:12.123 --> 00:28:22.873]  But InfoWarsTore.com is so critical that we have one of these last places where we can have a real press conference, or put the truth out, or even let you know what's happening and what is unfolding.
[00:28:22.873 --> 00:28:25.295]  But more important than anything is your prayers.
[00:28:25.295 --> 00:28:27.917]  Roger, 30-second closing comment, and good luck today at the hearing.
[00:28:28.737 --> 00:28:38.039]  You know, everybody needs to understand that the survival of InfoWars is a crucial part of my strategy for victory.
[00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:43.220]  It's the only place I can go where you will hear the unvarnished truth about what's really going on.
[00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:51.222]  So yes, I ask people to go to the InfoWars.com store now and just make a contribution if you're not in the market for one of our great products.
[00:28:51.222 --> 00:28:57.404]  Without this platform, without the support of Alex Jones and everyone at InfoWars, we cannot possibly win.
[00:28:59.309 --> 00:29:02.891]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[00:29:02.891 --> 00:29:06.473]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[00:29:06.473 --> 00:29:08.594]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.
[00:29:08.594 --> 00:29:10.615]  So what's so good about Sunny Bay Heating Pads?

[00:31:00.163 --> 00:31:02.424]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[00:31:02.424 --> 00:31:04.165]  There is no set stasis.
[00:31:04.165 --> 00:31:05.406]  There is no managed system.
[00:31:05.406 --> 00:31:07.047]  There is no un-continuum.
[00:31:07.047 --> 00:31:10.269]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:13.631]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[00:31:13.631 --> 00:31:14.871]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[00:31:14.871 --> 00:31:15.672]  We'll be here forever.
[00:31:15.672 --> 00:31:16.912]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[00:31:16.912 --> 00:31:23.796]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[00:31:23.796 --> 00:31:24.376]  We made it.
[00:31:24.376 --> 00:31:26.538]  And that's really where this goes.
[00:31:26.538 --> 00:31:28.359]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[00:31:28.359 --> 00:31:28.719]  And so,
[00:31:28.919 --> 00:31:35.386]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[00:31:35.386 --> 00:31:40.451]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[00:31:40.451 --> 00:31:43.315]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[00:31:43.315 --> 00:31:45.697]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[00:31:45.697 --> 00:31:49.201]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[00:31:49.201 --> 00:31:50.242]  I want to go to the next level.
[00:31:50.482 --> 00:31:57.646]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers that are cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[00:31:57.646 --> 00:31:58.706]  I want life!
[00:31:58.706 --> 00:31:59.907]  I want Jesus!
[00:31:59.907 --> 00:32:07.071]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it,
[00:32:07.671 --> 00:32:09.192]  That it lowers IQ.
[00:32:09.192 --> 00:32:12.053]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:32:12.053 --> 00:32:18.777]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:32:18.777 --> 00:32:25.061]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:30.644]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:32:31.324 --> 00:32:38.370]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:52.461]  But, chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:32:52.461 --> 00:32:56.705]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:32:56.705 --> 00:32:59.407]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[00:33:03.361 --> 00:33:05.956]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.822]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:26.822 --> 00:33:28.843]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.843 --> 00:33:38.749]  Now Paul Joseph Watson and Mark Dice are on to something really big and really important that could stop the censorship if the public figures out what's actually happening.
[00:33:38.749 --> 00:33:44.832]  Because now they're going after mainline popular people who they want to muscle under their control.
[00:33:44.832 --> 00:33:50.615]  And this is the model that the Wall Street Journal 10 months ago, two months before my deplatforming, admitted.
[00:33:51.377 --> 00:33:55.461]  They said, first we're getting Jones, then we're getting everybody.
[00:33:55.461 --> 00:33:58.804]  Because they knew that most people would say, oh, let them get Jones.
[00:33:58.804 --> 00:34:03.948]  And then, oh, let them get Franklin Graham.
[00:34:03.948 --> 00:34:06.350]  And let them get Stephen Crowder.
[00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.972]  And see, then it'll be everybody.
[00:34:07.972 --> 00:34:09.253]  Let them get Gavin McInnes.
[00:34:09.253 --> 00:34:09.993]  It's here, folks.
[00:34:09.993 --> 00:34:11.515]  It's a total takeover plan.
[00:34:12.597 --> 00:34:25.788]  So Paul Watson joins us coming up here in about two minutes, but I wanted to hold Roger over because this could be one of the last times we get to talk to Roger if this judge that's gagged other people does indeed gag him today at about two o'clock.
[00:34:25.788 --> 00:34:32.854]  And just finishing up, absolutely folks, you have to understand it's a statement of free speech like Laura Ingraham said to wear Make America Great Again hat.
[00:34:34.472 --> 00:34:38.093]  We have Make America Free Again red hats at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:34:38.093 --> 00:34:47.756]  It is a statement to wear InfoWars.com verboten information or to get a Roger Stone did nothing wrong shirt at his site StoneColdTruth.com.
[00:34:47.756 --> 00:34:52.537]  And again we are figureheads in the fight against this and I'm literally in your hands.
[00:34:53.457 --> 00:34:54.937]  Literally in your hands.
[00:34:54.937 --> 00:34:55.878]  I want to thank you all.
[00:34:55.878 --> 00:34:59.619]  I want to let you know I really appreciate everything that you've done.
[00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:06.461]  But just to understand that InfoWars as the mothership really needs your support now more than ever.
[00:35:06.461 --> 00:35:14.643]  But going back just for closing comments from Roger Stone about any other points you'd like to make before you're potentially gagged and before the court becomes a star chamber.
[00:35:16.021 --> 00:35:25.947]  Well, Alex, I was actually wearing the Roger Stone Did Nothing Wrong t-shirt when I was arrested because I was sleeping in it in a pair of cut-off sweatshorts.
[00:35:25.947 --> 00:35:31.831]  The FBI allowed me to change my shirt and put on a pair of long pants and a pair of shoes.
[00:35:31.831 --> 00:35:33.151]  They did take my St.
[00:35:33.151 --> 00:35:34.792]  Michael's medal off of me.
[00:35:34.792 --> 00:35:35.433]  I pray to St.
[00:35:35.433 --> 00:35:37.474]  Michael every day.
[00:35:37.474 --> 00:35:40.656]  And I wasn't allowed to have shoes with shoelaces or a belt, of course.
[00:35:41.785 --> 00:35:46.649]  But I appreciate everything you and the Infowars community have done for me.
[00:35:46.649 --> 00:35:48.710]  I intend to fight to the bitter end.
[00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.212]  I smell victory.
[00:35:51.212 --> 00:35:53.214]  I believe I will be exonerated.
[00:35:53.214 --> 00:35:54.895]  I won't be vindicated.
[00:35:54.895 --> 00:35:57.337]  I'm very proud of the President's support today.
[00:35:57.337 --> 00:36:08.805]  And we'll call in after court today, and of course the War Room later today, to keep you up to date on what the latest is, assuming I am not gagged.
[00:36:09.544 --> 00:36:17.456]  And if I am gagged, I think my daughter will probably be calling into the war room to say a few words.
[00:36:17.456 --> 00:36:18.737]  Roger, Godspeed and God bless.
[00:36:18.737 --> 00:36:20.280]  We'll be praying for you.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.122]  Many thanks, Alex.
[00:36:22.122 --> 00:36:23.364]  All right.
[00:36:23.364 --> 00:36:24.445]  We're going to introduce
[00:36:25.751 --> 00:36:41.119]  This piece with Paul Watson live joining us with a clip from Mark Dice's video that's posted in full on NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com, an article titled, YouTube Broke Its Own Search Engine to Rig the Algorithm for the Corporate Media.
[00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:44.781]  Now, I don't know where to begin with this.
[00:36:44.781 --> 00:36:54.866]  Sundar Pichai, the CEO, lying a few months ago to Congress when I was sitting three rows behind him, there was something about being there and him saying, we've never rigged a search result.
[00:36:55.626 --> 00:36:59.068]  We've never tailored them for anybody.
[00:36:59.068 --> 00:37:00.889]  We don't control anything.
[00:37:00.889 --> 00:37:03.310]  You pay them with advertisement to control results.
[00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:04.670]  That's their business.
[00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.172]  Now they're just doing it with news and information.
[00:37:07.172 --> 00:37:13.154]  And there's all the Hillary emails of them controlling what was in the search results and burying stuff in the campaign.
[00:37:13.154 --> 00:37:14.515]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:37:14.515 --> 00:37:18.257]  You've got Eric Schmidt admitting it a decade ago and two years ago that they do it.
[00:37:19.119 --> 00:37:26.565]  So the level now of perjury on serious issues is stratospheric.
[00:37:26.565 --> 00:37:28.827]  It's out of this world.
[00:37:28.827 --> 00:37:39.976]  But then I see people like this DeFranco guy criticize me, put me down on YouTube, routinely going with the talking point of how I'm a bad guy.
[00:37:39.976 --> 00:37:41.477]  And I'm not against this guy.
[00:37:41.477 --> 00:37:42.558]  I've seen some of his pieces that are good.
[00:37:42.558 --> 00:37:44.059]  He's a well-spoken fellow.
[00:37:44.059 --> 00:37:47.342]  He's got hundreds of millions of viewers overall, billions of views.
[00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:50.571]  And he does reviews of other people.
[00:37:50.571 --> 00:38:05.854]  But what YouTube and Google wanted to do, they told the Wall Street Journal 10 months ago, is they were just going to start going in to all the private popular channels and muscling them under their control to pay them less or just get rid of them entirely with demonetization, like PewDiePie.
[00:38:05.854 --> 00:38:13.896]  And that's what this is, is the old Hollywood guard, it's like the old record company guard, muscling in to take over, all thought.
[00:38:13.896 --> 00:38:15.997]  But they start with somebody they demonize, like myself,
[00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:24.317]  They put out a bunch of strongmen, they removed me off air, and then people don't stand up, so then the precedent's set.
[00:38:24.317 --> 00:38:28.902]  And so I see people now being criticized, and even shout out for Paul.
[00:38:30.339 --> 00:38:36.181]  Where if PewDiePie shouts out Paul or myself, then oh my God, take him off, you know, he's supporting these evil people.
[00:38:36.181 --> 00:38:41.423]  This is total thought control with these brigades running around doing this and then having them deny.
[00:38:41.423 --> 00:38:48.746]  You can put in the exact headline for videos Paul does, or other people do, or even our articles, and they won't come up.
[00:38:48.746 --> 00:38:50.407]  They're being blocked.
[00:38:50.407 --> 00:38:51.528]  The engine is rigged.
[00:38:51.528 --> 00:38:52.408]  And it's not just us now.
[00:38:54.286 --> 00:39:00.250]  Suddenly, if you won't pay Google whatever they want for your car dealership or your restaurant, they won't even list you now.
[00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.511]  Forget that you're 20 pages deep.
[00:39:02.511 --> 00:39:06.414]  So they are abusing the fact that they have 90 plus percent of search engine control.
[00:39:06.414 --> 00:39:08.535]  It's beyond monopoly and it's got to be dealt with.
[00:39:08.535 --> 00:39:16.961]  But Congress sits there with their thumbs, you know, where either paid off by these people or completely and totally ignorant.
[00:39:16.961 --> 00:39:19.182]  So let's play this Mark Dice clip and then go to Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:39:19.182 --> 00:39:19.723]  Here's Mark Dice.
[00:39:20.518 --> 00:39:36.970]  And speaking of YouTube manipulating the search results, if you type in the exact title of one of my most popular videos, Celebrities React to Hillary Clinton Losing Election, a video which has over 6 million views, it's nowhere to be found.
[00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:43.515]  Instead, you get results from places like Entertainment Tonight for their video, 61,000 views, or Business Insider with 70,000 views.
[00:39:47.458 --> 00:39:54.904]  CNN with 67,000 views, Wall Street Journal, Inside Edition, CBS, ABC.
[00:39:54.904 --> 00:40:02.109]  My video has more views than all of these videos combined, but it still is nowhere to be found.
[00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:06.172]  Oh where, oh where could my YouTube video be?
[00:40:07.233 --> 00:40:11.897]  How many pages have you buried it so people can't see?
[00:40:11.897 --> 00:40:16.260]  Let's try another one of my popular videos which has almost 2 million views.
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.143]  Michelle Obama trashes Hillary Clinton.
[00:40:19.143 --> 00:40:22.726]  Oh look, the top search result is from Hillary's YouTube channel.
[00:40:22.726 --> 00:40:25.648]  NBC News ABC Inside Edition.
[00:40:25.648 --> 00:40:26.869]  Where's my video?
[00:40:26.869 --> 00:40:34.655]  Wow, CBS News' video about Michelle Obama's 23,000 views definitely deserves to be ranked above mine.
[00:40:34.655 --> 00:40:35.916]  Maybe it's on page 2.
[00:40:38.268 --> 00:40:40.070]  Nope, don't see it there either.
[00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:43.194]  How about page 3?
[00:40:43.194 --> 00:40:45.236]  Nope, not there either.
[00:40:45.236 --> 00:40:47.638]  Oh, here it is on page 4!
[00:40:47.638 --> 00:40:53.004]  Buried under such popular videos like this one from KGUN Channel 9 with 750 views.
[00:40:57.358 --> 00:40:58.919]  So the alliance has been made.
[00:40:58.919 --> 00:41:06.843]  We've got undercover video showing it with big tech and old dying media to shut everybody else down so they can then lie about us and then put us in prison.
[00:41:06.843 --> 00:41:07.943]  It's also happening in Europe.
[00:41:07.943 --> 00:41:13.266]  Remember, he said on a hot mic, Zuckerberg, two years ago, don't worry, I'll start censoring all Germans that criticize you.
[00:41:13.266 --> 00:41:14.226]  And he did.
[00:41:14.226 --> 00:41:15.867]  Paul, you'll be with us for two more segments.
[00:41:15.867 --> 00:41:16.567]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:41:16.567 --> 00:41:18.048]  Tell us what the hell's going on here.
[00:41:19.335 --> 00:41:21.036]  Well, this is important, Alex.
[00:41:21.036 --> 00:41:23.097]  People need to realise how important this is.
[00:41:23.097 --> 00:41:26.018]  YouTube is the second biggest search engine in the world.
[00:41:26.018 --> 00:41:27.359]  It's owned by Google.
[00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:37.043]  Okay, Google gets criticism for potentially building a censored search engine in China that will digitally disappear political dissidents.
[00:41:37.043 --> 00:41:42.146]  Yet they're already doing it in the United States and nobody bats an eyelid.
[00:41:42.146 --> 00:41:43.586]  It's already happening.
[00:41:43.586 --> 00:41:44.607]  Okay, we've had studies.
[00:41:45.552 --> 00:41:54.697]  by Robert Epstein that show algorithmic changes in search results can shift millions of votes up to 12 million votes in elections.
[00:41:54.697 --> 00:42:06.464]  He said it personally shifted 2 to 3 million votes in Hillary Clinton's favour just with ranking certain search results above others exactly as he saw right there in that Mark Dice clip.
[00:42:06.464 --> 00:42:09.686]  So then the new aspect to this which we can delve into more after the break
[00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:22.198]  Is YouTube caving in within hours to a BuzzFeed article that whined and complained about, quote, conspiracy theory videos appearing in recommended videos on YouTube.
[00:42:22.198 --> 00:42:32.505]  So within hours they vowed to change their algorithm again and then you check what they consider to be conspiracy theory content and it's like mainstream immigration groups.
[00:42:32.505 --> 00:42:38.108]  It's Dinesh D'Souza, PragerU, Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson.
[00:42:38.108 --> 00:42:38.989]  This is not about
[00:42:39.614 --> 00:42:41.977]  You know, tamping down on conspiracy theories.
[00:42:41.977 --> 00:42:45.260]  Again, it's about censoring their political opposition.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:49.565]  And of course, they're moving towards the next level, censoring the left as well.
[00:42:49.565 --> 00:42:52.348]  This is a total and complete information control.
[00:42:52.348 --> 00:42:57.293]  And once these black holes start, like in Eastern Europe, under the Soviets, there's no end to it.
[00:42:57.293 --> 00:42:58.014]  Total censorship.
[00:43:02.014 --> 00:43:05.055]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:43:05.055 --> 00:43:11.496]  While coffee, candy and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[00:43:11.496 --> 00:43:26.940]  TurboForce from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity and a boost of energy on the go.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.701]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water and enjoy!
[00:43:32.512 --> 00:43:34.373]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars
[00:44:03.843 --> 00:44:10.446]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:44:10.446 --> 00:44:19.131]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:44:19.131 --> 00:44:23.733]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:44:23.733 --> 00:44:25.194]  You are the info war.
[00:44:25.194 --> 00:44:28.716]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:44:29.396 --> 00:44:34.220]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email.
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:40.784]  So there's no way the census can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.

[00:45:00.066 --> 00:45:10.676]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:45:10.676 --> 00:45:12.738]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:45:12.738 --> 00:45:15.600]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.102]  It's made in the USA.
[00:45:17.102 --> 00:45:23.928]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:45:23.928 --> 00:45:25.189]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:35.697]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[00:47:03.368 --> 00:47:18.696]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:18.696 --> 00:47:23.639]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:32.134 --> 00:47:33.655]  Infowars.com.
[00:47:33.655 --> 00:47:37.176]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:47:37.176 --> 00:47:46.720]  So, you've got all these really cool, trendy, awesome YouTube guys, and they're talented.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:55.905]  And they are reaching tens of millions of subscribers, billions of views, and they're making millions of dollars.
[00:47:55.905 --> 00:47:59.066]  But YouTube is making billions of dollars.
[00:48:01.056 --> 00:48:13.964]  And instead of YouTube and the whole Hollywood crowd and big tech coming in and treating people with respect, they're coming in to muscle and take over everything with what Paul Watson just broke down.
[00:48:13.964 --> 00:48:24.871]  Google's in big trouble, YouTube's parent company, Alphabet, its parent company, for running tests for censorship in China with Operation Dragonfly, which they should be.
[00:48:26.206 --> 00:48:27.647]  Helping the authoritarian regime oppress.
[00:48:27.647 --> 00:48:31.549]  But here, YouTube and Google are in the WikiLeaks already doing stuff like that.
[00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:36.493]  And now years later, they are blocking everybody who isn't establishment.
[00:48:36.493 --> 00:48:45.238]  If you're a big corporate establishment group, you get put in a list, this is racketeering, that you are favored and you are promoted to the top.
[00:48:45.238 --> 00:48:46.939]  It started when Hillary lost.
[00:48:46.939 --> 00:48:47.339]  It's been
[00:48:48.504 --> 00:48:49.765]  I'd say perfected.
[00:48:49.765 --> 00:48:53.688]  I mean, it's like total now in the last six months.
[00:48:53.688 --> 00:49:03.556]  And it's getting more and more intense where we can put a video up on a YouTube page as a test, and it gets 10,000 views on our page.
[00:49:03.556 --> 00:49:09.521]  And we can look, because we have Google Analytics still, it's getting zero on YouTube.
[00:49:09.521 --> 00:49:12.704]  All of it's watched on our platform using their bandwidth.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:18.411]  But understand, no one else can see it.
[00:49:18.411 --> 00:49:20.558]  No one is promoting it or sharing it on YouTube.
[00:49:20.558 --> 00:49:21.962]  It is locked in.
[00:49:23.336 --> 00:49:24.857]  Purgatory.
[00:49:24.857 --> 00:49:28.958]  It's locked in a phantom zone, you know, where they send General Zod.
[00:49:28.958 --> 00:49:33.239]  And then I start talking to other people, business owners and others that own nurseries.
[00:49:33.239 --> 00:49:39.842]  And others, they said, yeah, the last year my nursery videos used to get 100,000 views or so, how to plant this, how to do that.
[00:49:39.842 --> 00:49:44.283]  Now they get 10,000 views and none of it gets shared.
[00:49:44.283 --> 00:49:45.924]  And they used to have a bunch of mail order stuff.
[00:49:47.009 --> 00:49:49.051]  And now that's all gone suddenly.
[00:49:49.051 --> 00:49:56.236]  So you built YouTube, folks, and now they've rolled up the carpet and are exploiting it just like Facebook and it's criminal.
[00:49:56.236 --> 00:50:03.641]  Back to Paul Joseph Watson with this incredible news and some of the controversies that have come out of even some of these YouTube folks giving you a shout-out.
[00:50:03.641 --> 00:50:05.062]  Well, that gets them demonetized.
[00:50:05.062 --> 00:50:09.265]  That's how incredible the draconian control has gotten.
[00:50:09.265 --> 00:50:15.409]  Yeah, and let's not forget, Alex, the other aspect of this which is still a burgeoning story is NewsGuard.
[00:50:16.087 --> 00:50:21.729]  partnered with Microsoft to designate what is a trusted news source and what isn't.
[00:50:21.729 --> 00:50:39.714]  Even though they were caught the other day giving their little green verified tick on the UVA campus rape hoax, remember the 2014 Rolling Stone story, which was a proven hoax, they've given that story a tick of verification simply because it's in the Huffington Post.
[00:50:39.714 --> 00:50:42.775]  This again is a partisan bias organisation
[00:50:43.215 --> 00:50:47.617]  That is intended to, you know, manipulate the algorithm for search results.
[00:50:47.617 --> 00:50:51.338]  So, is Google going to partner with NewsGuard as well?
[00:50:51.338 --> 00:50:53.639]  So we've got that going on at the same time.
[00:50:53.639 --> 00:51:03.522]  And then, yeah, as you mentioned, the big YouTubers, one of them Shane Dawson, he put out a video called Conspiracy Theories with Shane Dawson, a 1 hour 45 minute documentary.
[00:51:03.522 --> 00:51:08.444]  This is a guy with 20 million subscribers, tens of millions of views on all his videos.
[00:51:08.444 --> 00:51:11.145]  He did a big series with Jake Paul a few months back.
[00:51:12.077 --> 00:51:16.280]  And for the first few hours, his video was completely demonetized.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:24.505]  Again, probably, although they deny it, although they also deny, Alex, that they don't manipulate search results for partisan ends, even though they clearly do.
[00:51:24.505 --> 00:51:25.306]  We've just proven that.
[00:51:26.184 --> 00:51:28.725]  So they denied that they demonetized his video.
[00:51:28.725 --> 00:51:31.306]  He lost tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:51:31.306 --> 00:51:35.607]  And I warned him about it the night before it happened on Twitter.
[00:51:35.607 --> 00:51:36.927]  You can see the tweet right there.
[00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.648]  I said, is he going to get punished?
[00:51:38.648 --> 00:51:42.729]  The next day, yes, he got punished and he lost tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:51:42.729 --> 00:51:45.610]  And that, of course, caused a furore.
[00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:48.651]  Him merely coming back and responding and saying that he liked my stuff.
[00:51:49.341 --> 00:51:52.884]  Caused a meltdown from the blue checkmarks on Twitter.
[00:51:52.884 --> 00:51:54.164]  So we had that going on.
[00:51:54.164 --> 00:51:57.427]  But again, this was in response to the BuzzFeed story.
[00:51:57.427 --> 00:52:07.514]  And that's not the first time that a left-wing digital news outlet, most of which are obviously collapsing, having to sack 15% of their workforce like BuzzFeed because nobody reads them anymore.
[00:52:07.514 --> 00:52:09.756]  It wasn't the first time it happened, Alex.
[00:52:09.756 --> 00:52:18.762]  Back a few weeks ago, Slate wrote an article complaining that the top search results on YouTube about abortion were mainly pro-life.
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:24.546]  Within hours, the search results were changed to be mainly pro-abortion.
[00:52:24.546 --> 00:52:32.496]  They replaced the pro-life Conservative videos with videos from BuzzFeed, Vice, CNN, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.
[00:52:32.496 --> 00:52:34.999]  And then Breitbart asked them about it.
[00:52:35.985 --> 00:52:45.776]  And again, they denied that they did that, although then a leaked chat transcript from within Google came out which said, quote, this was them talking to each other.
[00:52:45.776 --> 00:52:53.224]  Seems like we are pretty eager to cater our search results to the social and political agenda of left wing journalists.
[00:52:53.224 --> 00:52:54.285]  So yet again, Alex.
[00:52:55.347 --> 00:53:06.844]  Just as they conspired to abuse their platforms to de-platform you, they're doing it once again, not just with individuals, but with news events, with search terms, and with political issues like abortion.
[00:53:09.164 --> 00:53:10.945]  Well, they're only covering their tracks here.
[00:53:10.945 --> 00:53:15.247]  We have the Project Veritas videos, we have the documents, we have the congressional hearings.
[00:53:15.247 --> 00:53:29.694]  Going back about three years ago, they began to coordinate top media with big tech to control and manipulate, and then they expanded it down even to mid-level employees, and now trusted flaggers like Joe Rogan's people are given YouTube-level access
[00:53:30.414 --> 00:53:38.320]  Uh, to the accounts, to systems, to everything, and then they can go in and literally, like the Young Turks did to us that time, and just delete whole channels if they want to.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:45.905]  So, they're giving their political leftist class this weaponized power, and then denying it and playing stupid even before Congress.
[00:53:45.905 --> 00:53:58.333]  So, as a class, they're combining with big tech and other companies to literally engage in a reign of terror like locusts that fly from one media institution to the next, that's successful, eating it to the bone.
[00:53:58.333 --> 00:53:59.774]  I mean, this is organized, my friend.
[00:54:01.124 --> 00:54:05.548]  Yeah, and what they do is they get their own organisations with their own people and their own allies.
[00:54:05.548 --> 00:54:12.095]  They get institutions, Soros funded groups, to write reports saying that YouTube is causing radicalisation.
[00:54:12.095 --> 00:54:18.521]  Then they cite those reports in their articles and then bring them to YouTube and say, look, this is hate.
[00:54:18.521 --> 00:54:22.385]  In fact, one of the groups mentioned in this BuzzFeed article
[00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:30.596]  is the Center for Immigration Studies and they said, oh well the SPLC says it's a hate group so surely YouTube should ban this.
[00:54:30.596 --> 00:54:33.799]  Again, it's all the same people and everyone's a hate group.
[00:54:33.799 --> 00:54:39.464]  They conflate conspiracy content with hyper-partisan and misogynist videos, okay?
[00:54:39.464 --> 00:54:44.388]  If you criticize the Women's March, you're a misogynist, bye-bye goes your video.
[00:54:44.388 --> 00:54:45.889]  So I contacted BuzzFeed
[00:54:46.784 --> 00:55:03.195]  Charlie Warzel, who is one of your stalkers, Alex, one of the guys who de-platformed you, again wrote articles about it for months on end, and he said, oh, YouTube would never de-platform people like Ben Shapiro or Jordan Peterson because their followings are too large.
[00:55:03.195 --> 00:55:06.117]  Well, you know who had a bigger following on YouTube than both of them?
[00:55:06.909 --> 00:55:08.231]  It was you, Alex!
[00:55:08.231 --> 00:55:09.792]  And look what happened to you!
[00:55:09.792 --> 00:55:13.577]  So again, they're coming back to me with complete... Oh, they have scripts of deception.
[00:55:13.577 --> 00:55:18.562]  That whole Soy Boy fake thing is a cover for really alpha male criminal activity.
[00:55:18.562 --> 00:55:21.946]  These guys all are given battle scripts, propaganda terms.
[00:55:21.946 --> 00:55:23.988]  It's a unified criminal operation.
[00:55:23.988 --> 00:55:26.011]  And then they go right before Congress and lie, Paul.
[00:55:27.984 --> 00:55:35.849]  Oh yeah, of course it was Deutsche and all those other Democrat congressmen, lawmakers that pressured Facebook, YouTube to ban you before it happened.
[00:55:35.849 --> 00:55:36.850]  Which is the point.
[00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:38.691]  This is election meddling.
[00:55:38.691 --> 00:55:43.494]  They changed the search results on YouTube before the abortion referendum in Ireland.
[00:55:43.494 --> 00:55:44.975]  That is clear election meddling.
[00:55:44.975 --> 00:55:45.676]  The point is this.
[00:55:46.613 --> 00:55:48.474]  We need executive action, Alex.
[00:55:48.474 --> 00:55:55.400]  We need Section 230 of the Communications Act changed, which makes it a criminal offence for them to censor content.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:57.641]  It needs to be called election meddling.
[00:55:57.641 --> 00:55:58.882]  It needs to be made illegal.
[00:55:58.882 --> 00:56:01.284]  They need to be held responsible.
[00:56:01.284 --> 00:56:06.648]  But from what Roger Stone said when he talked to Brad Parscale, it's not at the top of the Trump administration's agenda.
[00:56:07.008 --> 00:56:16.348]  Well, Newsflash, you're going to lose the next election because you're going to lose millions and millions of votes because algorithmic changes change millions of votes.
[00:56:16.348 --> 00:56:16.949]  That's a fact.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:27.970]  Paul, we'll do one more segment when we come back and get into more solutions of what you see coming next, but it's the lying to Congress, it's the collusion, it's the organized list they have.
[00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:37.600]  Again, the Wall Street Journal 10 months ago in a 30-page report that you cited and then others picked up, the headlines were, hold on to your tinfoil hat, Alex Jones, YouTube's about to ban you.
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:44.042]  And it said in there, don't worry to the corporations, invest in old newspapers, invest in old TV.
[00:56:44.042 --> 00:56:45.563]  We're working with big tech.
[00:56:45.563 --> 00:56:46.883]  We're going to remove everyone.
[00:56:46.883 --> 00:56:49.725]  We're going to start with WikiLeaks and Alex Jones.
[00:56:49.725 --> 00:56:52.806]  And by 2019, we're going to start banning everybody.
[00:56:52.806 --> 00:56:54.046]  Well, guess what, boys?
[00:56:54.046 --> 00:56:55.407]  It's already happening.
[00:56:56.047 --> 00:56:58.509]  And the last standing will be Joe Rogan.
[00:56:58.509 --> 00:56:59.170]  Literally.
[00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:00.411]  That's all they're going to leave on.
[00:57:00.411 --> 00:57:01.331]  That's the plan.
[00:57:01.331 --> 00:57:03.073]  They're going to take PewDiePie off.
[00:57:03.073 --> 00:57:04.954]  They're going to take Sean Dawson off.
[00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:09.018]  They're going to take all these people off because they're independent and they're popular.
[00:57:09.018 --> 00:57:10.078]  And they're not political.
[00:57:10.078 --> 00:57:11.900]  These people see you as properties.
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.641]  They want control.
[00:57:13.641 --> 00:57:15.203]  They want control.
[00:57:15.203 --> 00:57:16.624]  They want control.
[00:57:16.624 --> 00:57:21.408]  And so if you question anything, global warming, vaccine dangers, anything,
[00:57:22.148 --> 00:57:23.469]  You will be banned.
[00:57:23.469 --> 00:57:25.350]  And that's the new global social score.
[00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:27.611]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:30.473]  Remember, that's where you gotta go to find the streams.
[00:57:30.473 --> 00:57:33.675]  That's where you gotta go to spread the word and tell folks, hey, it's still there.
[00:57:33.675 --> 00:57:34.675]  The enemy isn't winning.
[00:57:34.675 --> 00:57:36.096]  They're standing up against it.
[00:57:36.096 --> 00:57:37.357]  We're standing together.

[00:58:50.519 --> 00:58:56.548]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:58:56.548 --> 00:58:59.492]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:58:59.492 --> 00:59:04.078]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply on the top.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:14.245]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[00:59:14.245 --> 00:59:19.608]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.

[00:59:36.619 --> 00:59:39.141]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.

[00:59:53.351 --> 00:59:56.153]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.667 --> 01:00:30.461]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:32.542]  Paul Joseph Watson's here, in case you just joined us.
[01:00:33.604 --> 01:00:37.026]  Huge breaking news on the censorship control fronts.
[01:00:37.026 --> 01:00:50.555]  I want Paul to have the floor the next five minutes and really lay out exactly what's happening, exactly what we're facing, and how huge this is, and how if people just wake up, this could really explode in Big Tech's face.
[01:00:50.555 --> 01:00:51.276]  Paul, take it away.
[01:00:52.822 --> 01:00:55.343]  Yeah, people need to realise how important this is.
[01:00:55.343 --> 01:01:01.526]  Google gets criticised for potentially building a dragonfly-censored search engine in China.
[01:01:01.526 --> 01:01:04.047]  People lose their minds over that, and rightly so.
[01:01:04.047 --> 01:01:09.509]  People criticise Google for working in China to digitally disappear political dissidents.
[01:01:09.509 --> 01:01:10.909]  Yes, that's outrageous.
[01:01:10.909 --> 01:01:16.432]  But it's already happening in the United States, and nobody bats an eyelid.
[01:01:16.432 --> 01:01:17.212]  We've had studies
[01:01:18.078 --> 01:01:25.700]  By Dr. Robert Epstein, which have shown algorithmic manipulation by big tech and shift millions of votes during elections.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.981]  He said it could shift up to 12 million votes.
[01:01:27.981 --> 01:01:34.523]  He said it did shift 2 to 3 million votes in Hillary Clinton's favor with bias search algorithms.
[01:01:34.523 --> 01:01:38.184]  So the Trump administration needs to take it may put the tension to this.
[01:01:38.184 --> 01:01:42.946]  They need to put it top of their agenda because otherwise they're going to lose in 2020.
[01:01:42.946 --> 01:01:44.066]  This is absolutely massive.
[01:01:44.818 --> 01:01:49.622]  You can change the minds of people by putting certain search results over others.
[01:01:49.622 --> 01:02:01.632]  YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, and we've proven for a fact that they are now placing mainstream media outlet results above independent content creator results.
[01:02:01.632 --> 01:02:11.421]  Even when you search the direct search term, videos with six million views are buried beneath dozens and dozens of mainstream media videos.
[01:02:12.213 --> 01:02:15.336]  In one case, a Mark Dice video was on page 4.
[01:02:15.336 --> 01:02:16.837]  It had 2 million views.
[01:02:16.837 --> 01:02:24.184]  It was below another video produced by a mainstream news station which had a paltry 750 views.
[01:02:24.184 --> 01:02:29.228]  This is open, brazen, partisan election meddling.
[01:02:29.228 --> 01:02:35.054]  They've been caught doing this in Ireland with the abortion referendum in Ireland putting pro-abortion content above
[01:02:36.915 --> 01:02:40.318]  Pro-life content to change the minds of people during an election.
[01:02:40.318 --> 01:02:41.839]  That is election meddling.
[01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:47.825]  Slate wrote an article complaining that pro-life content was appearing at the top of search results.
[01:02:47.825 --> 01:02:52.349]  Within hours, YouTube changed it to relegate that pro-life content.
[01:02:52.349 --> 01:02:55.171]  Again, clear partisan meddling.
[01:02:55.171 --> 01:03:01.877]  Now BuzzFeed writes an article saying that YouTube needs to tamp down on conspiracy theory content.
[01:03:02.137 --> 01:03:04.699]  Oh, what do they define as conspiracy theory content?
[01:03:04.699 --> 01:03:08.542]  Hyper-partisan and misogynistic videos, okay?
[01:03:08.542 --> 01:03:12.966]  A misogynistic video could be somebody criticizing the Women's March.
[01:03:12.966 --> 01:03:19.671]  A hyper-partisan video could be someone criticizing, you know, Cortez or Cory Booker.
[01:03:19.671 --> 01:03:21.292]  This is election meddling.
[01:03:21.292 --> 01:03:21.893]  They talk about
[01:03:22.745 --> 01:03:25.406]  Anti-social justice warrior or misogynist clips.
[01:03:25.406 --> 01:03:26.626]  They want those censored.
[01:03:26.626 --> 01:03:36.509]  And once again, the very next day, YouTube caved, came back and said, yes, we will now implement controls where we censor this conspiracy content.
[01:03:36.509 --> 01:03:38.630]  In the BuzzFeed article, what's conspiracy content?
[01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:42.832]  Again, it's Dinesh D'Souza, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson.
[01:03:42.832 --> 01:03:44.152]  They conflate all of it.
[01:03:44.492 --> 01:04:02.239]  So again, this is just another excuse for them to silence their political opposition, to silence their adversaries, by abusing their platforms to pressure Big Tech, not even pressure them, they're both working hand-in-hand, to again censor any content that goes against the progressive dogma.
[01:04:02.239 --> 01:04:03.500]  That's why this is important.
[01:04:04.153 --> 01:04:04.554]  You're right, Paul.
[01:04:19.492 --> 01:04:24.735]  And in closing, Big Tech, above all, is a psychological advertising operation and control system.
[01:04:24.735 --> 01:04:25.916]  They know what they're doing.
[01:04:25.916 --> 01:04:28.918]  So they picked us off, picked others off, set the precedent.
[01:04:28.918 --> 01:04:30.959]  Now it's turned into a giant snowball.
[01:04:30.959 --> 01:04:40.304]  And because other people wouldn't stand up and wouldn't resist it, and Congress has done nothing, it's green-lit total censorship, where now it's going to be Ben Shapiro, and now it's going to be President Trump.
[01:04:40.304 --> 01:04:42.065]  They're talking about taking Trump off Twitter.
[01:04:42.065 --> 01:04:43.086]  This is now here.
[01:04:43.086 --> 01:04:44.307]  It's the big crisis.
[01:04:44.307 --> 01:04:47.769]  But you're at NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and fighting on.
[01:04:48.149 --> 01:04:48.911]  And we salute you.
[01:04:48.911 --> 01:04:51.535]  Everybody should take this video, once we post it, and share it.
[01:04:51.535 --> 01:04:52.617]  Thank you, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:04:52.617 --> 01:04:53.378]  Great job.
[01:04:53.378 --> 01:04:55.803]  We'll be back with more Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:05:01.024 --> 01:05:04.046]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:05:04.046 --> 01:05:10.490]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:25.960]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[01:05:47.995 --> 01:05:50.858]  Perk up with TurboForce at infowarrestore.com.
[01:06:14.173 --> 01:06:15.274]  InfoWars.
[01:06:15.274 --> 01:06:23.259]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[01:06:23.259 --> 01:06:31.445]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[01:06:31.445 --> 01:06:33.146]  Alex Jones?
[01:06:33.146 --> 01:06:35.407]  The far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently...
[01:06:42.679 --> 01:06:43.560]  Alex Jones!
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.941]  Scum!
[01:06:44.941 --> 01:06:47.984]  Russian scum!
[01:06:47.984 --> 01:06:57.674]  It always comes to mind.
[01:06:57.674 --> 01:06:59.495]  Reputation's amazing.
[01:06:59.495 --> 01:07:01.017]  I will not let you down.
[01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.819]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:13.476]  You know, I'm very frustrated with Roger Stone.
[01:07:13.476 --> 01:07:14.836]  I'm very angry at him.
[01:07:14.836 --> 01:07:19.098]  I'm very frustrated and I'm very angry at Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:07:19.098 --> 01:07:24.200]  I'm very frustrated and I'm very angry at my wife.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.481]  I'm very frustrated and I'm very angry with the crew in here.
[01:07:26.481 --> 01:07:32.143]  And I'm very, very frustrated and angry with myself.
[01:07:32.143 --> 01:07:34.424]  And I'm very frustrated and I'm very angry with you.
[01:07:34.424 --> 01:07:38.666]  And I'm very frustrated and angry with our local radio and TV stations.
[01:07:39.733 --> 01:07:43.075]  I'm frustrated with our sponsors.
[01:07:43.075 --> 01:07:50.259]  Because despite the fact that we know the truth and we know how serious and dangerous things are, we don't act like it's dangerous.
[01:07:50.259 --> 01:07:52.661]  And we don't take the proper actions like it's dangerous.
[01:07:52.661 --> 01:07:59.925]  And I've been wrapping my mind around something here that a very high-level globalist told me off-record.
[01:08:01.331 --> 01:08:14.302]  And I think listeners and viewers have figured out now, if I tell you I've got something big off record, and I can't tell you, that's the journalistic hat I'm wearing, that's how people tell me things, because they know I then will not release the information, unless it's criminal.
[01:08:14.302 --> 01:08:20.027]  But you know, some of the stuff they told me years ago, I've thought about it, it really is criminal.
[01:08:20.027 --> 01:08:28.395]  Because their whole program is criminal, and I've told this story probably a hundred times in the last decade.
[01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:31.749]  Hard to believe it happened a decade ago.
[01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:43.973]  I can't even find the date of when it happened because I was flying on American Airlines First Class on ABC's Dime to be on The View for my first and only time.
[01:08:43.973 --> 01:08:45.033]  They invited me back last year.
[01:08:45.033 --> 01:08:46.073]  I refused to go.
[01:08:46.073 --> 01:08:52.395]  It's just a bunch of harpies lying.
[01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:54.676]  And I'm on the plane First Class with the head
[01:08:56.266 --> 01:08:57.847]  Of the third largest bank in the U.S.
[01:08:57.847 --> 01:08:59.847]  and I'm like, I recognize you.
[01:08:59.847 --> 01:09:03.008]  He goes, yeah, I recognize you too.
[01:09:03.008 --> 01:09:10.111]  And so we talked a little bit in the three hour flight about his dad, who's a retired general.
[01:09:10.111 --> 01:09:19.334]  He was visiting in San Antonio and hell yeah, he can fly on one of the company jets, but he just likes to fly because it's easier, because the jets can't always be there.
[01:09:19.334 --> 01:09:23.355]  And he was talking about the economic crisis that had just happened.
[01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:26.771]  2008, I guess about 2009.
[01:09:26.771 --> 01:09:44.082]  And when I started talking about nationalism and the family and how we defeat globalism and all the rest of it, instead of me kind of being a distraction, he took his glasses off and he said, you want to know something off the record?
[01:09:44.082 --> 01:09:45.243]  This is off the record, right?
[01:09:45.243 --> 01:09:48.705]  You can tell your people about it because you're not going to stop us.
[01:09:48.705 --> 01:09:51.367]  But it was just like out of network.
[01:09:51.367 --> 01:09:52.928]  In fact, let's cue that up if we can.
[01:09:55.043 --> 01:10:09.108]  But he didn't get as upset, but he had that whole corporate alpha male thing down, like, I'd only experienced like a few times, like my dad's dad was that type of alpha male, where they can just turn it on like that, and it's like, whoa, and they're not even trying to do it.
[01:10:09.108 --> 01:10:16.351]  And, you know, I can turn it on if I'm unscrewing somebody's head, but these guys just, like a faucet, they have it.
[01:10:16.351 --> 01:10:24.494]  And it was as the plane was landing, and it's taxiing, and he finished his statement as he got up, perfectly dressed, in a three-hour flight in his suit, got his black trench coat out,
[01:10:25.563 --> 01:10:36.666]  I'm all slobbed out sitting there, nervous about being on The View, drinking a vodka and a screwdriver at 10 in the morning, which I don't normally do.
[01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:44.988]  And he pointed right at me and he just said, you'll never beat us because of this.
[01:10:44.988 --> 01:10:48.329]  And he laid it all out to me.
[01:10:48.329 --> 01:10:53.471]  And he said, you think people adapt and overcome, like the Marines say.
[01:10:54.588 --> 01:11:02.451]  You think to the adversity of what we're doing to you that you're going to adapt and that you're going to overcome?
[01:11:02.451 --> 01:11:03.492]  And he goes, no.
[01:11:03.492 --> 01:11:09.154]  People adapt to what we take away from them and what we do to them.
[01:11:09.154 --> 01:11:15.917]  And he goes, the public will never really want your help in the end.
[01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:20.298]  And if they were in the positions we're in, they would tear all of us apart.
[01:11:20.298 --> 01:11:23.920]  And he said, you'd be advised, son, to get on the right team.
[01:11:25.168 --> 01:11:30.450]  And he got his jacket out, perfectly put it on, and walked off the plane.
[01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:33.752]  And that's the same speech I've gotten from other ones.
[01:11:33.752 --> 01:11:34.812]  And that's the attitude.
[01:11:34.812 --> 01:11:41.295]  And their attitude is, hey, this stuff's all going on out in the open.
[01:11:41.295 --> 01:11:45.276]  And the people put up with it.
[01:11:45.276 --> 01:11:48.258]  And notice how the public didn't stand up for me when I got censored.
[01:11:48.258 --> 01:11:49.238]  Our audience did.
[01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.899]  The best people out there, literally.
[01:11:50.899 --> 01:11:51.539]  That's the core.
[01:11:51.539 --> 01:11:52.259]  They want shut down.
[01:11:52.259 --> 01:11:53.540]  They don't want you communicating with each other.
[01:11:55.353 --> 01:12:04.560]  You're who they fear, but for the general public, they didn't have the instinct that Americans used to have that, hey, if we're taking one person's free speech, we're about to take it all.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:18.350]  I mean, you can have pedophile shows on Netflix and praise devil worship everywhere, but you can't have Alex Jones on the air questioning public events.
[01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:21.793]  Our Congress doesn't care that Google's helping set up total slavery in China.
[01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:28.088]  So, see, the establishment says, hey, you're an alpha that's smart.
[01:12:28.088 --> 01:12:31.230]  You should join us, the other alphas, instead of trying to help these people.
[01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:33.272]  But, you see, you look at these globalists.
[01:12:33.272 --> 01:12:34.853]  A lot of their kids commit suicide.
[01:12:34.853 --> 01:12:36.274]  They're really unhappy.
[01:12:36.274 --> 01:12:37.235]  They're real robotic.
[01:12:37.235 --> 01:12:39.637]  They're all about power and control and about how they
[01:12:42.827 --> 01:12:43.847]  Are these incredible people?
[01:12:43.847 --> 01:12:45.268]  But they're not, really.
[01:12:45.268 --> 01:12:47.028]  Because, yeah, I know the world's fallen.
[01:12:47.028 --> 01:12:50.028]  I know the general public's got problems.
[01:12:50.028 --> 01:12:52.489]  But they're a mirror of the establishment.
[01:12:52.489 --> 01:12:58.050]  And now the establishment acts, they then repeat, and they become that because they're followers.
[01:12:58.050 --> 01:13:03.971]  And it's because of the globalist bad leadership that they just think it's survival of the fittest.
[01:13:03.971 --> 01:13:11.053]  That they've cut off the Christian ethos that was the engine and the fount, the headwaters, of everything good.
[01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:11.753]  And that's a fact!
[01:13:16.502 --> 01:13:18.444]  And so that's really what this comes down to.
[01:13:18.444 --> 01:13:27.492]  But, you know, we all just are adopting and adapting to being killed.
[01:13:27.492 --> 01:13:36.220]  We're just opting in to be dehumanized and demoralized and to hate our life force and to hate our mission and to not believe we have some greater goal in the universe.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:40.443]  In just the last 40 years, they've turned the whole seafaring
[01:13:41.761 --> 01:13:50.648]  Wagon train, expansionist idea of the Christian Western ethos into we're horrible, we're bad, we've got to roll over and die.
[01:13:50.648 --> 01:13:54.051]  And everything being established is the end of humans as we know it.
[01:13:54.051 --> 01:13:57.874]  It's the post-human era that the globalists are pushing for.
[01:13:57.874 --> 01:13:59.736]  And they all believe they're going to have it.
[01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:02.038]  They all believe they're going to get it.
[01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:08.303]  And they're biblically buying into this devilish lie that if they'll just come in and play God on earth and do all these terrible, horrible things,
[01:14:09.744 --> 01:14:17.190]  Somehow then they'll transcend their humanity and their fallenness by becoming even more fallen.
[01:14:17.190 --> 01:14:19.773]  They've been in the dark so long, they don't know what light is.
[01:14:19.773 --> 01:14:24.156]  They've been upside down so long, they think down is up.
[01:14:24.156 --> 01:14:34.325]  They think crawling down into Hades, down a trillion miles of the devil's intestines, is finding God.
[01:14:34.325 --> 01:14:37.368]  When no, you're not finding God, you're finding destruction.
[01:14:39.312 --> 01:14:49.134]  So when I see some dim-witted, wannabe priesthood leftist who's into controlling people, and even knows the whole narrative is a fraud, cuss and yell at me, it doesn't get me down.
[01:14:49.134 --> 01:14:53.274]  They're cussing and yelling at me as a person.
[01:14:53.274 --> 01:14:56.515]  In fact, at a bestial level, the energy jacks me up.
[01:14:56.515 --> 01:15:02.696]  But I feel sorry that they're an agent of evil, and that they've consciously made the decision.
[01:15:02.696 --> 01:15:07.917]  And that's what's happening in the world right now, is that people are making the conscious decision to join with evil.
[01:15:08.953 --> 01:15:15.596]  And that's why you see governors coming out and saying, yeah, I said we keep babies alive and kill them after they're born, big deal.
[01:15:15.596 --> 01:15:19.337]  I don't apologize.
[01:15:19.337 --> 01:15:27.441]  And Vice doesn't apologize for all their pro pedophile shows in the New York Times because, hey, they think we're weak and they're making their move.
[01:15:28.544 --> 01:15:33.387]  They've got all their followers put in place, and they're making their move on us, so we come back.
[01:15:33.387 --> 01:15:37.390]  Do you want to adapt to being a slave, or do you want to adapt and overcome?
[01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:41.673]  Because I am about adapting by overcoming.
[01:15:41.673 --> 01:15:54.703]  By building our future, by deciding what it will be, not adapting to the architecture and the false paradigm they put us into, but by doing what humans do in the image of God, building our environment, deciding our destiny.
[01:15:54.703 --> 01:15:56.164]  I am creating new destinies!

[01:16:27.011 --> 01:16:33.355]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:36.398]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.398 --> 01:16:42.322]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.322 --> 01:16:46.104]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.104 --> 01:16:47.385]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.385 --> 01:16:48.726]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.726 --> 01:16:54.931]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[01:18:01.075 --> 01:18:04.116]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.

[01:18:58.174 --> 01:19:01.635]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:19:01.635 --> 01:19:05.417]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:19:05.417 --> 01:19:11.679]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:19:11.679 --> 01:19:14.460]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:19.024]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:19:19.024 --> 01:19:25.511]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:30.456]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:19:31.212 --> 01:19:35.135]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:19:35.135 --> 01:19:42.339]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:19:42.339 --> 01:19:47.563]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:19:47.563 --> 01:19:53.246]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:19:53.246 --> 01:19:57.209]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:20:00.859 --> 01:20:09.665]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:09.665 --> 01:20:25.356]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:40.565]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:40.565 --> 01:20:42.907]  So I have fought with the devil.
[01:20:42.907 --> 01:20:50.052]  I got down on his level, but thanks to Jesus Christ, I never gave in, so he gave up on me to quote Keith Whitley.
[01:20:50.052 --> 01:21:00.239]  But I just spent a whole segment getting into the globalist ace in the hole, they believe, that you don't adapt and overcome to tyranny, you learn to submit to it.
[01:21:01.224 --> 01:21:11.187]  It was done by increment, by successive approximation, or the frog in the pot of water that's slowly taken up to boil.
[01:21:11.187 --> 01:21:22.051]  So I'm going to hit two stories, one this segment, one next, that are completely illustrative of this, and just really sit back, because I have to do this too.
[01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:22.851]  I'm not lecturing here.
[01:21:24.073 --> 01:21:28.376]  You have to really sit back and let it sink in what's going on.
[01:21:28.376 --> 01:21:48.649]  Now imagine if you were coming out with telecommunications equipment 40 years ago that was developed, where you would have a portal or a hub or a managing robot in the house that would control and manipulate all the devices, all pre-programmed with a universal remote, and that that system, like a Palantir,
[01:21:49.858 --> 01:21:51.358]  Let's see what the NSA program is called.
[01:21:51.358 --> 01:22:00.140]  A crystal ball that you can ask questions to, you can look into, but the problem is it's two-way.
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:04.941]  Now, why on earth would you bring something into your house that's two-way?
[01:22:04.941 --> 01:22:11.062]  Because it's not just like a telephone where you dial the number and it goes out and somebody wants to tap it, they got to break in on that line.
[01:22:11.062 --> 01:22:17.163]  This is a system where the whole world and five billion people that are on the internet
[01:22:18.973 --> 01:22:28.255]  Out of seven and a half billion and all these computers and all these hackers, why on earth would you ever?
[01:22:28.255 --> 01:22:31.775]  Why would you ever put something like that in your house?
[01:22:31.775 --> 01:22:32.315]  We'll see.
[01:22:32.315 --> 01:22:35.476]  Here's the normalcy bias.
[01:22:35.476 --> 01:22:37.196]  You're not a killer.
[01:22:37.196 --> 01:22:39.136]  You're not a murderer.
[01:22:39.136 --> 01:22:40.897]  You're not any of these things.
[01:22:40.897 --> 01:22:47.038]  So you project onto it that it's good
[01:22:48.058 --> 01:22:49.058]  Because you're good.
[01:22:49.058 --> 01:22:54.741]  That's why so many people get in the yellow Volkswagen with Ted Bundy and they get raped and tortured for three days.
[01:22:54.741 --> 01:22:59.443]  That's why so many people can get conned or get scammed.
[01:22:59.443 --> 01:23:03.464]  Because that's what they do.
[01:23:03.464 --> 01:23:04.325]  That's how they operate.
[01:23:04.325 --> 01:23:06.786]  They play on you projecting that.
[01:23:06.786 --> 01:23:11.808]  So, a family was watched through national security cameras.
[01:23:12.827 --> 01:23:19.990]  You know, when these things came out a few years ago, I said, all these wireless systems, anybody can grab into them, whatever they want.
[01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:25.132]  Amazon's already watching you with live AI systems, already gathering data for sales.
[01:23:25.132 --> 01:23:26.093]  There is a race.
[01:23:26.093 --> 01:23:32.236]  Imagine if this was coming out 20, 30 years ago, which it did, these systems, into corporate understanding.
[01:23:32.236 --> 01:23:42.240]  There would be a race, wouldn't there, by all the tech companies, big and small, to see who can get an autonomous surveillance pod
[01:23:43.433 --> 01:23:45.454]  An Imperial Probe Droid.
[01:23:45.454 --> 01:23:47.295]  Let's not use the Palantir analogy.
[01:23:47.295 --> 01:23:52.457]  Let's use an Imperial Probe Droid analogy.
[01:23:52.457 --> 01:23:58.660]  Imperial Probe Droids, they're not too powerful themselves, but they'll call in some really big bad guys.
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:01.662]  Here's a microcosm example of this.
[01:24:01.662 --> 01:24:12.387]  A lot of folks, until they figured out how to do it, would post on Facebook where they lived, geolocated, didn't know it was doing it on the photos, of what they got for Christmas and they were going to go to Cancun.
[01:24:13.476 --> 01:24:25.061]  They come home a week later and their entire house had been robbed and someone had been living in it and had been there until the very day they flew back because they were broken into your computers through Facebook.
[01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:26.482]  They knew everything about you.
[01:24:26.482 --> 01:24:36.327]  They were watching you post photos of yourself that morning having a last pina colada in Cancun.
[01:24:38.143 --> 01:24:43.930]  So, you put these things in, and they're so convenient for you, but they're all two-way.
[01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:56.765]  Let's play a clip from Lord of the Rings, where Gandalf's like, why do you have this two-way camera system, this computer system, that's the archetypal, you know, the ancients envisioned something like this, almost like they'd been through this before.
[01:24:57.648 --> 01:25:03.034]  Erase memory, because in the future, that's what they say, it'll actually be a ball that projects into your house everything.
[01:25:03.034 --> 01:25:05.277]  In fact, that's the new designs they plan in about 10 years.
[01:25:05.277 --> 01:25:07.400]  It'll actually be a crystal ball.
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.142]  Oh, wow, strange.
[01:25:09.142 --> 01:25:14.788]  Every culture said that they'd seen those or heard of those, and now there'll be crystal balls for everyone that are two-way.
[01:25:15.729 --> 01:25:20.211]  But, see, you go where you want, but you don't control who comes in.
[01:25:20.211 --> 01:25:22.272]  It's a big doorway into your life.
[01:25:22.272 --> 01:25:26.294]  Who would put a big black ball in your house that anything could come through?
[01:25:26.294 --> 01:25:30.616]  Oh, and it turns out some folks came through on their little kids.
[01:25:30.616 --> 01:25:36.379]  Tried to kill them with the computer that was controlling their house, see?
[01:25:36.379 --> 01:25:42.422]  You set up a robot, because you trust big tech, because they just run slave camps in China.
[01:25:44.082 --> 01:25:47.284]  So, Gandalf knew it was a problem, but Saruman didn't think it was a problem.
[01:25:47.284 --> 01:25:48.584]  Here it is.
[01:25:48.584 --> 01:25:52.486]  A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.
[01:25:52.486 --> 01:25:54.387]  Why?
[01:25:54.387 --> 01:25:59.810]  Why should we fear to use it?
[01:25:59.810 --> 01:26:03.891]  They are not all accounted for, the Lost Seeing Stones.
[01:26:03.891 --> 01:26:06.393]  We do not know who else may be watching.
[01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:12.352]  The hour is later than you think.
[01:26:12.352 --> 01:26:17.195]  Sauron's forces are already moving.
[01:26:17.195 --> 01:26:20.397]  The Nine have left Minas Morgul.
[01:26:20.397 --> 01:26:21.437]  The Nine?
[01:26:21.437 --> 01:26:27.401]  They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve, disguised as riders in black.
[01:26:27.401 --> 01:26:29.062]  They've reached the Shire.
[01:26:29.062 --> 01:26:33.365]  They will find the Ring.
[01:26:33.365 --> 01:26:36.087]  And kill the one who carries it.
[01:26:36.087 --> 01:26:36.367]  Frodo.
[01:26:42.715 --> 01:26:43.636]  Join with Google.
[01:26:43.636 --> 01:26:45.277]  Join with Facebook.
[01:26:45.277 --> 01:26:47.619]  Everyone else is?
[01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:50.241]  No one can stop the power of Sauron.
[01:26:50.241 --> 01:26:55.224]  You do not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron?
[01:26:55.224 --> 01:27:00.568]  There are none who can.
[01:27:00.568 --> 01:27:08.173]  Against the power of Mordor, there can be no victory.
[01:27:08.173 --> 01:27:09.354]  We must join with
[01:27:12.495 --> 01:27:13.876]  We must join with Saruman.
[01:27:13.876 --> 01:27:20.723]  It would be wise, my friend.
[01:27:20.723 --> 01:27:24.326]  Tell me, friend.
[01:27:24.326 --> 01:27:28.450]  When did Saruman, the wise of Batman, reason for madness?
[01:27:42.464 --> 01:27:46.468]  Everybody's joining with Solaron, but nine have left.
[01:27:46.468 --> 01:27:48.669]  Google and Apple have already moved to China.
[01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:51.712]  The pedophiles are making their move, announcing themselves.
[01:27:51.712 --> 01:27:52.192]  The A.I.
[01:27:52.192 --> 01:27:53.313]  is rolling out.
[01:27:53.313 --> 01:27:55.756]  They're letting you know your phones are watching you.
[01:27:55.756 --> 01:27:57.237]  They keep your mouth shut or we'll censor you!
[01:27:59.235 --> 01:28:00.215]  Yes, my friends.
[01:28:00.215 --> 01:28:01.616]  We come back, though.
[01:28:01.616 --> 01:28:14.499]  Imagine that voice coming through over the Palantir and threatening your children, and then learning about it, and then learning that they were trying to burn your house down, trying to destroy your thermostat, trying to sabotage.
[01:28:14.499 --> 01:28:20.701]  And that was just one evildoer using the Palantir.
[01:28:20.701 --> 01:28:27.463]  When we return, you bring the Trojans in, and then you wonder when they were designed as weapons,
[01:28:28.444 --> 01:28:33.226]  By the AI global takeover that someone else jumped the gun.
[01:28:33.226 --> 01:28:37.007]  That someone else used the Nest.
[01:28:37.007 --> 01:28:38.707]  The Alexa.
[01:28:38.707 --> 01:28:40.628]  The system.
[01:28:40.628 --> 01:28:42.849]  Too early.
[01:28:42.849 --> 01:28:44.889]  Yeah, someone jumped the gun.
[01:28:44.889 --> 01:28:47.450]  Don't let them know yet!
[01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:48.770]  The attack!
[01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:49.911]  In the dead of night!
[01:28:49.911 --> 01:28:50.531]  En masse!
[01:28:57.113 --> 01:28:59.496]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[01:28:59.496 --> 01:29:02.359]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[01:29:02.359 --> 01:29:07.424]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[01:29:07.424 --> 01:29:14.612]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[01:29:14.612 --> 01:29:19.177]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[01:29:19.759 --> 01:29:23.401]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[01:29:23.401 --> 01:29:26.502]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[01:29:26.502 --> 01:29:29.143]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[01:29:29.143 --> 01:29:30.644]  Get sober now.
[01:29:30.644 --> 01:29:33.985]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[01:29:33.985 --> 01:29:34.785]  It's simple.

[01:29:59.933 --> 01:30:05.818]  I think our best products are Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with a 95% curcuminoid level that no other company got.
[01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:06.519]  Nobody else did.
[01:30:06.519 --> 01:30:10.583]  Because everybody else, they put in a little bit of product and then they do a bunch of advertising and promote it.
[01:30:10.583 --> 01:30:11.864]  The turmeric in this is 95% curcuminoid.
[01:30:13.786 --> 01:30:16.488]  Nobody else has that bright yellow school bus color.
[01:30:16.488 --> 01:30:17.449]  That's what you're looking for.
[01:30:17.449 --> 01:30:18.049]  It's got it.

[01:32:00.428 --> 01:32:02.169]  There is no set stasis.
[01:32:02.169 --> 01:32:03.390]  There is no managed system.
[01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:05.051]  There is no un-continuum.
[01:32:05.051 --> 01:32:08.273]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[01:32:08.273 --> 01:32:11.635]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[01:32:11.635 --> 01:32:12.876]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[01:32:12.876 --> 01:32:13.677]  We'll be here forever.
[01:32:13.677 --> 01:32:14.918]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[01:32:14.918 --> 01:32:21.802]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:22.363]  We made it.
[01:32:22.363 --> 01:32:24.544]  And that's really where this goes.
[01:32:24.544 --> 01:32:26.346]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[01:32:26.346 --> 01:32:26.726]  And so,
[01:32:26.926 --> 01:32:33.393]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[01:32:33.393 --> 01:32:38.438]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[01:32:38.438 --> 01:32:41.321]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[01:32:41.321 --> 01:32:43.703]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[01:32:43.703 --> 01:32:47.207]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[01:32:47.207 --> 01:32:48.228]  I want to go to the next level.
[01:32:48.468 --> 01:32:52.751]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[01:32:52.751 --> 01:32:55.473]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[01:32:55.473 --> 01:32:56.714]  I want life!
[01:32:56.714 --> 01:33:01.758]  I want Jesus!
[01:33:01.758 --> 01:33:04.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:16.389 --> 01:33:21.793]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[01:33:21.793 --> 01:33:24.014]  I'm a friend of thunder.
[01:33:24.014 --> 01:33:26.416]  Friend as in any wonder.
[01:33:26.416 --> 01:33:32.260]  Lightning strikes me.
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:34.942]  I fought with the devil.
[01:33:34.942 --> 01:33:37.623]  Got down on his level.
[01:33:37.623 --> 01:33:39.184]  But I never gave in.
[01:33:39.184 --> 01:33:40.726]  So he gave up on me.
[01:33:40.726 --> 01:33:42.166]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:44.141]  3 p.m.
[01:33:44.141 --> 01:33:44.783]  I'm here live.
[01:33:44.783 --> 01:33:48.332]  Very honored to be here, very thankful for all your support, your prayers.
[01:33:52.483 --> 01:33:54.624]  I'll be back this Sunday live as well, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:54.624 --> 01:33:56.305]  Don't forget The War Room, live from D.C.
[01:33:56.305 --> 01:33:56.646]  today.
[01:33:56.646 --> 01:34:01.709]  We'll have Roger Stone either gagged or un-gagged by this nightmare judge that's creating a star chamber.
[01:34:01.709 --> 01:34:04.070]  At least that's what Mueller's requesting.
[01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:07.092]  She's done that so far with other cases.
[01:34:07.092 --> 01:34:15.638]  He gags people from speaking out in the press so the press can destroy him, and she doesn't let them do fundraising.
[01:34:15.638 --> 01:34:20.161]  I mean, you talk about Soviet, that puts the S in Soviet big time.
[01:34:21.949 --> 01:34:24.990]  And of course, uh, we're being targeted right along with Roger.
[01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:28.232]  People say, well, why would you do that, dummy?
[01:34:28.232 --> 01:34:32.154]  Oh, like the whole world's about trying to get out of confrontation.
[01:34:32.154 --> 01:34:34.815]  Listen, I'm not looking for any confrontation.
[01:34:34.815 --> 01:34:40.778]  I like to be out on a little aluminum boat with a 20 horsepower motor with my kids.
[01:34:40.778 --> 01:34:43.479]  That's about as close to heaven as you're going to get.
[01:34:43.479 --> 01:34:50.322]  But I can't sit there and ride around on a boat all day and have a good time while the enemy's coming down on us.
[01:34:51.414 --> 01:34:52.454]  And it's really that simple.
[01:34:52.454 --> 01:34:55.255]  This is, that's why I do not like listeners saying, Oh, you're so great.
[01:34:55.255 --> 01:34:56.036]  You're such a hero.
[01:34:56.036 --> 01:35:10.721]  Listen, if I was in a truck and flipped off the road and it went into a river and let's say my two year old was in a, God forbid, was in a,
[01:35:13.989 --> 01:35:16.390]  Their safety seat and we were going underwater.
[01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:20.891]  It wouldn't be heroic that I'd climb in the back and make damn sure she got out.
[01:35:20.891 --> 01:35:21.672]  That's my baby.
[01:35:21.672 --> 01:35:22.792]  That's mine.
[01:35:22.792 --> 01:35:24.052]  I want that.
[01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:27.534]  He didn't heroic to try to save my baby.
[01:35:27.534 --> 01:35:31.115]  That isn't something special to do.
[01:35:31.115 --> 01:35:36.476]  I'll do a lot more than climb in the back of some flooding out car to get my baby.
[01:35:36.476 --> 01:35:37.857]  And I just don't understand.
[01:35:39.349 --> 01:35:41.332]  How people don't have will.
[01:35:41.332 --> 01:35:52.390]  Like used to, I used to go a long time ago and swim laps back when I was in better shape like 20 years ago at a place called Deep Eddy and it's got an Olympic sized pool and I could swim from one end
[01:35:53.874 --> 01:36:04.804]  to the other underwater and they had these Olympic, former Olympic athletes that were there and most of them couldn't do it and I'd have bets with them and beat them and they said how do you do that because you're not even like I said it's will.
[01:36:04.804 --> 01:36:11.630]  I had to turn my brain off and decide that I'm dead if I don't do this and then it's easy.
[01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:15.813]  I can still do like a length and a half I just don't have that will like I used to.
[01:36:15.813 --> 01:36:19.717]  Plus my heart starts beating way too fast but the point is
[01:36:21.365 --> 01:36:27.288]  That people don't understand deciding you're going to do something.
[01:36:27.288 --> 01:36:29.870]  They don't get it.
[01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:36.413]  And if you want to know why the globalists are so scared of this broadcast, it's because they don't have will.
[01:36:36.413 --> 01:36:40.775]  At the top, they've got evil will to dominate, but their minions are a bunch of followers.
[01:36:40.775 --> 01:36:48.279]  And just the idea of someone having will scares the hell out of them.
[01:36:48.279 --> 01:36:50.881]  But so much of will is deciding something's right.
[01:36:52.369 --> 01:36:55.571]  And then flipping a switch.
[01:36:55.571 --> 01:37:00.213]  Flipping a switch saying, I made a decision that I'm not going to roll over to what you're doing.
[01:37:00.213 --> 01:37:02.094]  And it's that spirit that they fear.
[01:37:02.094 --> 01:37:06.616]  It's that idea that the enemy wants to stop because they want to rule your life.
[01:37:06.616 --> 01:37:07.916]  They want to run your life.
[01:37:07.916 --> 01:37:09.277]  They think you're a bunch of morons.
[01:37:12.912 --> 01:37:21.035]  Now I just spent a whole segment getting into the tech we've brought into our houses and our worlds and how great it works and how wonderful it is.
[01:37:21.035 --> 01:37:36.082]  It's not bad itself, but it was designed and built in a corporate rollout where they're all competing with each other over who can get the most AI in your house to watch and listen to everything you do to control your life and then manipulate decisions you make to run your life.
[01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:49.960]  I mean, you wouldn't let some Senate committee in your house to live there and tell you how to cook dinner or what to watch on television, and you sure as hell wouldn't want them in your bedroom.
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:38:06.013]  But on record, and we first broke this, since these things came out, it's been their business model to listen to every damn thing you say.
[01:38:06.013 --> 01:38:07.434]  It's not just when you hit the button.
[01:38:10.549 --> 01:38:14.973]  It's not just when you hit the button, and you ask it a question.
[01:38:14.973 --> 01:38:18.195]  That's, that's, you get to, oh, you get to look in the crystal ball.
[01:38:18.195 --> 01:38:20.657]  It's watching you, Jack.
[01:38:20.657 --> 01:38:23.179]  And do you know who's on the other end of that?
[01:38:23.179 --> 01:38:25.701]  Not a very nice feller.
[01:38:25.701 --> 01:38:29.324]  So I said I'd get to it with this segment, but we gotta get to it next because I want to play the whole CBS news piece.
[01:38:29.324 --> 01:38:35.849]  But here's this family, and they hear their little kid being talked to by a man.
[01:38:35.849 --> 01:38:36.790]  And they keep wondering why.
[01:38:38.204 --> 01:39:02.676]  The heat's turned up to 90 on the baby's room and stuff's going crazy because you've got some lower-level psychotic that knows it's easy to grab through the transmissions or other systems the code to your nest or any other of these smart meters or any of them because they're all designed to steal your data!
[01:39:02.676 --> 01:39:04.817]  That's what they're designed to do, Jack!
[01:39:09.281 --> 01:39:13.723]  So it's like, oh, these devices are vulnerable!
[01:39:13.723 --> 01:39:22.328]  They're designed... It's like saying, a Roman short sword is vulnerable to being a very effective weapon at killing people.
[01:39:22.328 --> 01:39:26.490]  It's not vulnerable, it's designed.
[01:39:26.490 --> 01:39:32.033]  Wood chippers are vulnerable to being able to chew up lots of wood.
[01:39:32.033 --> 01:39:36.055]  Lighters are vulnerable towards combustion.
[01:39:36.055 --> 01:39:36.836]  Forty-five
[01:39:39.616 --> 01:39:47.122]  9-11 cults are vulnerable to firing seven shots.
[01:39:47.122 --> 01:39:51.005]  It's designed to do it.
[01:39:51.005 --> 01:40:03.495]  It's the big global corporate system, and it's what they're providing, and what they're rolling out, and they go before Congress and say, we're not watching or listening to anybody, and it's in their own corporate minutes they're doing it, but here's the deal.
[01:40:03.495 --> 01:40:05.677]  We know this.
[01:40:05.677 --> 01:40:06.438]  We know this.
[01:40:09.546 --> 01:40:18.529]  And when somebody gave, some family member last Christmas gave one of my daughters one of these damn things.
[01:40:18.529 --> 01:40:25.711]  And I hear something up in her room and I go in there and there is, there is a Lexus set up and my daughter's talking to it, my middle daughter.
[01:40:25.711 --> 01:40:29.633]  And I didn't act like Moses that found a golden calf and go crazy, I should have.
[01:40:29.633 --> 01:40:33.734]  I took it and I said, I'll take evil and turn it to good.
[01:40:33.734 --> 01:40:36.015]  I took it to the office, we did a piece with it here and the thing.
[01:40:38.095 --> 01:40:43.238]  I must not be doing a good enough job that my own family buys my children these damn things.
[01:40:43.238 --> 01:40:44.818]  You can say, well, the phone is the same deal.
[01:40:44.818 --> 01:40:47.340]  I get it.
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:48.440]  But it can be locked up.
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.822]  It can be put in a lead container in your purse.
[01:40:51.822 --> 01:40:53.142]  It can be put away.
[01:40:53.142 --> 01:40:56.004]  It can be... No, this is supposedly in the center of your life.
[01:40:56.912 --> 01:41:05.484]  Like Daddy and Mommy used to be a big evil robot spying on everybody and that everybody else can then jump into and dial into.
[01:41:05.484 --> 01:41:08.548]  Imagine the left in Apple, what jerks they are there.
[01:41:08.548 --> 01:41:11.212]  None of their kids are allowed to use iPads any of it ever.
[01:41:11.212 --> 01:41:13.135]  Back to Steve Jobs, because that's for you.
[01:41:14.176 --> 01:41:17.359]  With a back door, two buttons they call, any phone number they want.
[01:41:17.359 --> 01:41:18.179]  Bloop, bloop.
[01:41:18.179 --> 01:41:29.108]  Keep wondering how BuzzFeed and the Washington Post can break into anybody's phone or anything, and how they know everything, and how CNN knew how much money we were making at YouTube, and what videos we had, and what we were saying in private emails.
[01:41:29.108 --> 01:41:32.791]  Because it came out, they were given access.
[01:41:32.791 --> 01:41:36.614]  Oliver Darcy, Ryan Stelter, to my private account!
[01:41:38.001 --> 01:41:51.435]  These people are brazen and they do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want, and they've got crystal balls in your car, in your hand, in your living room, in your bathroom.
[01:41:51.435 --> 01:41:54.458]  I remember years ago,
[01:41:55.836 --> 01:41:58.797]  My wife would be crawling all over me, which is good.
[01:41:58.797 --> 01:42:00.878]  And I'd say, hey, put the phones in the bathroom.
[01:42:00.878 --> 01:42:02.298]  She's like, oh, no one's listening.
[01:42:02.298 --> 01:42:04.459]  Well, number one, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:42:04.459 --> 01:42:06.680]  And number two, sweetheart, I'm pulling up Patton's.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.380]  Well, that kind of kills my mood.
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:10.981]  I go, here's the Patton's.
[01:42:10.981 --> 01:42:11.702]  2004, we first broke it.
[01:42:11.702 --> 01:42:13.022]  They're listening and watching everything.
[01:42:13.022 --> 01:42:15.723]  The whole business model is that, you know how valuable that is?
[01:42:15.723 --> 01:42:23.886]  They know with these ion waves they send out now, and this is really high tech, if you've got a brain tumor or cancer now, they don't just,
[01:42:24.826 --> 01:42:27.467]  It's like, well, what do we have to hide we're having sex?
[01:42:27.467 --> 01:42:30.729]  I don't need a damn robot in the room while I'm having sex!
[01:42:30.729 --> 01:42:32.449]  That's my whole point!
[01:42:32.449 --> 01:42:33.770]  Geez, I mean, why?
[01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:36.351]  See, it's weird to talk about having sex with your wife on air.
[01:42:36.351 --> 01:42:37.752]  That's kind of misogynistic.
[01:42:37.752 --> 01:42:38.852]  That's kind of, ugh, ugh.
[01:42:38.852 --> 01:42:40.273]  Humans having babies.
[01:42:40.273 --> 01:42:47.156]  But, if you got a robot and a whole tech company can dial in with two buttons and listen, well, that's just fine!
[01:42:47.156 --> 01:42:49.377]  See?
[01:42:49.377 --> 01:42:52.058]  Teach your kids pedophilia's good, just don't have sex with your wife.
[01:42:53.456 --> 01:42:53.916]  Oh, maybe.
[01:42:53.916 --> 01:42:54.396]  We'll be right back.

[01:47:01.301 --> 01:47:18.932]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:21.993]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[01:47:21.993 --> 01:47:25.095]  In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[01:47:25.095 --> 01:47:27.417]  The only problem with playing a Hank Williams Jr.
[01:47:27.417 --> 01:47:29.538]  song is that it's pumper music, we gotta cut it off.
[01:47:30.433 --> 01:47:39.428]  Alright, let me get serious because there's a lot of news I haven't gotten to.
[01:47:39.428 --> 01:47:40.790]  We have a special guest joining us.
[01:47:42.751 --> 01:48:06.696]  It's just this whole idea of bringing tech in from evil companies whose business model is watching and listening and using NSA software from the Echelon program in the 70s and 80s, that's just old school stuff, to track everything you say and then put it into a computer algorithm where if you talk about Louis Vuitton handbags, two hours later it's all over your phone because they're listening!
[01:48:08.407 --> 01:48:11.067]  And then people say, oh, well, that's AI.
[01:48:11.067 --> 01:48:12.068]  I'm not worried about it.
[01:48:12.068 --> 01:48:15.988]  Well, you better be worried about the companies and what they use that information for.
[01:48:15.988 --> 01:48:19.149]  Meanwhile, family was watched through Nest security cameras.
[01:48:19.149 --> 01:48:23.730]  I'm gonna get to this and then do a story.
[01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:27.990]  But when I saw it a few days ago, I said, I'm always the guy that says this stuff first.
[01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:29.451]  And every once in a while, I'm wrong.
[01:48:29.451 --> 01:48:33.351]  I said, let me let everybody else find out.
[01:48:33.351 --> 01:48:35.372]  Just showing the establishment, doesn't matter what you do to me.
[01:48:35.372 --> 01:48:36.592]  People are onto your crap now.
[01:48:37.862 --> 01:48:40.723]  And the police aren't buying it, no one's buying it.
[01:48:40.723 --> 01:48:46.945]  This Empire actor where the guys at Ski Mask called him the n-word and said you're a queer and all this stuff.
[01:48:46.945 --> 01:48:48.966]  And everybody's saying it's a false flag.
[01:48:48.966 --> 01:48:51.347]  There's no video, even though there's cameras of it.
[01:48:52.888 --> 01:48:54.470]  It's millions of these shows.
[01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:56.831]  Everybody's a star that's got some show.
[01:48:56.831 --> 01:49:01.135]  And then now they've got people crying on TV saying Trump's behind it.
[01:49:01.135 --> 01:49:04.338]  So you at least know the response to it is a false flag.
[01:49:04.338 --> 01:49:12.764]  But oh, if it turns out it was real, which maybe this is the one out of a thousand hate crimes that's real, then it's like, oh, Alex is evil for questioning it.
[01:49:12.764 --> 01:49:14.746]  No, I'm not.
[01:49:14.746 --> 01:49:16.027]  It's my first minute, right?
[01:49:16.027 --> 01:49:17.648]  And I've been proven right over and over again.
[01:49:17.648 --> 01:49:20.491]  But we'll go over some of their hundreds of fake hate crimes.
[01:49:22.125 --> 01:49:26.506]  Because you know, there's not a lot of folks spray painting queers on people's walls.
[01:49:26.506 --> 01:49:32.767]  You know, we're not that interested in what you do in your bedroom, bro.
[01:49:32.767 --> 01:49:35.328]  Oh, I'm so sick of it.
[01:49:35.328 --> 01:49:42.909]  Yeah, you're in Chicago where blacks kill 2,000 blacks a year, and whites might kill five blacks a year, but whites are evil, and oh, you're a poor victim.
[01:49:42.909 --> 01:49:46.210]  We're gonna look at it all.
[01:49:46.210 --> 01:49:47.550]  But first, since I mentioned it,
[01:49:49.142 --> 01:49:58.628]  Family was watched through Nest security cameras, and they hear this man's voice, they feel crazy, they hear it again, then they capture it.
[01:49:58.628 --> 01:50:06.073]  And then the guy's jacking with everything in the house, trying to kill the baby with 90 degree turned up heater, turning the power off, or messing with everything.
[01:50:06.073 --> 01:50:11.377]  This is what you brought into your house, so that even if there were system-wide bugs or problems, everything goes down.
[01:50:11.377 --> 01:50:14.339]  Why would you want ubiquitous systems like this?
[01:50:14.339 --> 01:50:18.522]  Well, because, you know, I can then watch my house remotely.
[01:50:20.114 --> 01:50:22.777]  Really, what about knowing your neighbors?
[01:50:22.777 --> 01:50:24.139]  Besides, what are you going to do all day then?
[01:50:24.139 --> 01:50:27.643]  You know, we've got these on the office, similar systems.
[01:50:27.643 --> 01:50:29.746]  It's like, oh, we got an alert.
[01:50:29.746 --> 01:50:31.728]  Oh, a deer walked by, or a stray dog.
[01:50:31.728 --> 01:50:34.792]  You know, you spend your whole life just watching and watching and watching.
[01:50:34.792 --> 01:50:38.477]  Don't have guns, but, oh, have lots of cameras, lots of cameras, which don't actually cut crime.
[01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:47.363]  I'm not saying cameras in themselves are bad, but these are two-way digital cameras that anybody can jump on and then use against you.
[01:50:47.363 --> 01:50:55.366]  It turns out thieves are casing joints, breaking in instantly to these, and using things like Nest systems, because they're the most ubiquitous.
[01:50:55.366 --> 01:50:57.607]  Like, whatever the biggest system is, always the worst.
[01:50:57.607 --> 01:50:59.348]  Whatever's the biggest.
[01:50:59.348 --> 01:51:03.529]  Like, PC always had all the viruses because it was the biggest, and Mac was small, so they weren't.
[01:51:03.529 --> 01:51:04.770]  Now that they're big, they have viruses.
[01:51:05.765 --> 01:51:08.046]  It's like, oh, I've got the biggest, I've got the best.
[01:51:08.046 --> 01:51:12.787]  You mean a big, giant, red X on your ass?
[01:51:12.787 --> 01:51:15.388]  So let's go to this CBS News report out of Chicago.
[01:51:15.388 --> 01:51:17.028]  Here it is.
[01:51:17.028 --> 01:51:27.671]  As I approached the baby's room and stood outside, I was shocked to hear a deep, manly voice talking to my seven-month-year-old son.
[01:51:27.671 --> 01:51:28.871]  My blood ran cold.
[01:51:28.871 --> 01:51:31.372]  Arjun Sood was standing outside Oliver's door.
[01:51:32.145 --> 01:51:32.945]  Back it up.
[01:51:32.945 --> 01:51:33.846]  I agree with the father.
[01:51:33.846 --> 01:51:34.346]  That's not good.
[01:51:34.346 --> 01:51:35.706]  But Bill Maher would say it's love.
[01:51:35.706 --> 01:51:39.248]  I mean, Bill Maher says a 12-year-old should have sex with 35-year-olds.
[01:51:39.248 --> 01:51:39.668]  It's love.
[01:51:39.668 --> 01:51:41.529]  So, hey!
[01:51:41.529 --> 01:51:42.789]  We gotta hate crime.
[01:51:42.789 --> 01:51:46.911]  The father is trying to stop his baby, who's consensual of age.
[01:51:47.967 --> 01:51:50.208]  To have a conversation with whoever this person is.
[01:51:50.208 --> 01:51:51.709]  I mean, that's the leftist view.
[01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:55.812]  I'm just kind of bringing you fair and balanced, like, what would BuzzFeed or Vice say?
[01:51:55.812 --> 01:51:56.493]  I'm not saying that.
[01:51:56.493 --> 01:51:57.914]  The father's absolutely right.
[01:51:57.914 --> 01:52:01.356]  But I'm going to be cutting in as if I was Vice with the other side of the story.
[01:52:01.356 --> 01:52:02.537]  Let's continue.
[01:52:02.537 --> 01:52:04.378]  To my seven-month-year-old son.
[01:52:04.378 --> 01:52:05.999]  My blood grandpa.
[01:52:05.999 --> 01:52:06.759]  Hold on.
[01:52:06.759 --> 01:52:07.700]  That's pedophobia.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:09.001]  Back it up.
[01:52:09.001 --> 01:52:10.162]  We got our thought crime.
[01:52:10.162 --> 01:52:11.302]  I hate crime here.
[01:52:11.302 --> 01:52:12.023]  Back it up to the beginning.
[01:52:13.103 --> 01:52:16.946]  You don't like some... Hello, little baby.
[01:52:16.946 --> 01:52:19.148]  How are you doing tonight?
[01:52:19.148 --> 01:52:21.830]  How dare you not want that in your house?
[01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:24.732]  It's like Cuomo said on CNN.
[01:52:24.732 --> 01:52:31.497]  He said, if your daughter is at the public school and ten years old and a dude comes in who thinks she's a woman, she should rejoice looking at his genitals.
[01:52:31.497 --> 01:52:32.618]  Your daughter's a hate monger.
[01:52:33.724 --> 01:52:34.985]  Let's continue.
[01:52:53.494 --> 01:53:01.061]  An unseen intruder talking to them through their Nest security camera using obscenities including the n-word.
[01:53:01.061 --> 01:53:09.069]  Asking me, you know, why I'm looking at him because he saw obviously that I was looking back and continuing to taunt me.
[01:53:09.069 --> 01:53:12.672]  It was terrifying.
[01:53:12.672 --> 01:53:15.294]  We just want to talk to your babies.
[01:53:15.294 --> 01:53:18.898]  We have drag king days with your elementary students teaching about this.
[01:53:19.855 --> 01:53:20.596]  It's ma'am!
[01:53:20.596 --> 01:53:22.878]  All I'm trying to do is talk to your baby!
[01:53:22.878 --> 01:53:24.699]  It's ma'am!
[01:53:24.699 --> 01:53:29.724]  It's Kid Love, the production company, you know, of Bill Maher!
[01:53:29.724 --> 01:53:30.584]  It's ma'am!
[01:53:30.584 --> 01:53:32.306]  What are you looking at?
[01:53:32.306 --> 01:53:37.330]  I'm having a conversation with your baby right now, and that's these people, they're very... It's city council-like.
[01:53:37.330 --> 01:53:40.333]  We're gonna have conversations with your five-year-olds, and you're not gonna stop us.
[01:53:41.834 --> 01:53:42.555]  It was terrifying.
[01:53:42.555 --> 01:53:43.395]  What's that?
[01:54:01.471 --> 01:54:08.955]  Sude believes the hacker also turned their upstairs thermostat to 90 degrees, noticing that the same night.
[01:54:08.955 --> 01:54:10.836]  A potential danger to their baby.
[01:54:10.836 --> 01:54:12.457]  And then they mess with our thermostat.
[01:54:12.457 --> 01:54:15.338]  Give me your child.
[01:54:15.338 --> 01:54:19.660]  We didn't break through thousands of dimensions to not sue this planet of pieces.
[01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:20.821]  Get us control now!
[01:54:22.659 --> 01:54:25.420]  We've almost got our... See, this is all tentacles for them.
[01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:26.241]  That's what you're going to see.
[01:54:26.241 --> 01:54:32.663]  All the devices are going to be used for all these demonically possessed people to then interface with them, and then the real hell's going to begin.
[01:54:32.663 --> 01:54:38.646]  But all their tentacles, all their weapons, all their surveillance is being put in, and then all you're going to see is demonic manifestation.
[01:54:38.646 --> 01:54:39.786]  Demonic manifestation.
[01:54:39.786 --> 01:54:41.387]  This is the invasion.
[01:54:41.387 --> 01:54:42.307]  This is the invasion.
[01:54:42.307 --> 01:54:44.968]  Take the chip and join us now.
[01:54:44.968 --> 01:54:46.249]  Please give us our children.
[01:54:46.249 --> 01:54:47.169]  Oh, it's liberal.
[01:54:47.169 --> 01:54:48.390]  We give us our children!
[01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:50.291]  It's kid love productions!
[01:54:53.536 --> 01:54:55.599]  Sorry, I'm just dialing into the transmission.
[01:54:55.599 --> 01:54:56.199]  Sorry.
[01:54:56.199 --> 01:54:57.421]  It's not healthy to do that, is it?
[01:54:57.421 --> 01:55:00.364]  Here, let's just go back to this transmission.
[01:55:00.364 --> 01:55:00.885]  Who does that?
[01:55:00.885 --> 01:55:01.846]  Again, who does that?
[01:55:01.846 --> 01:55:07.913]  The suits unplugged their interior cameras, called police, and soon after, NEST itself.
[01:55:07.913 --> 01:55:08.875]  Did you hear that?
[01:55:10.319 --> 01:55:12.280]  Nest-a-phobic thing.
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:17.203]  A loving person wants to burn the baby up and is wanting to have a little... Get out of my way.
[01:55:17.203 --> 01:55:19.305]  I'm having a discussion with your child.
[01:55:19.305 --> 01:55:21.266]  How dare you interfere with me!
[01:55:21.266 --> 01:55:23.867]  I'm grooming your baby.
[01:55:23.867 --> 01:55:25.588]  I've been grooming it for a while.
[01:55:25.588 --> 01:55:29.291]  I'm a liberal.
[01:55:29.291 --> 01:55:33.393]  Children, we need to go to the toilet!
[01:55:33.393 --> 01:55:34.934]  Families are bad, Google said!
[01:55:34.934 --> 01:55:35.595]  Destroy!
[01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:36.515]  Destroy the family!
[01:55:36.515 --> 01:55:37.216]  Hail Satan!
[01:55:37.216 --> 01:55:38.336]  Hail Satan!
[01:55:38.336 --> 01:55:38.917]  Let's continue.
[01:55:38.917 --> 01:55:39.157]  Go ahead.
[01:55:39.571 --> 01:55:45.033]  The Suds unplugged their interior cameras, called police, and soon after, Nest itself.
[01:55:45.033 --> 01:55:53.816]  And then they said, well, you should have used a unique password and two-factor authentication, and if you did, you know, that would be that.
[01:55:53.816 --> 01:55:58.978]  Sud's been using Nest for years, sinking thousands of dollars into the system to help secure his home.
[01:55:58.978 --> 01:55:59.718]  Pause again.
[01:55:59.718 --> 01:56:00.618]  But it's your fault.
[01:56:00.618 --> 01:56:01.439]  See, you didn't know.
[01:56:01.439 --> 01:56:03.259]  Let me explain something, Bubba.
[01:56:03.259 --> 01:56:05.300]  Amazon's got AI watching your butt.
[01:56:06.417 --> 01:56:11.685]  So you think that low-level demon that got in on there so he could stare at your baby is a problem?
[01:56:11.685 --> 01:56:14.929]  Buddy, that is the least of your problems.
[01:56:14.929 --> 01:56:20.357]  Real devils don't show their tails until they got you hanging up by your toes.
[01:56:21.793 --> 01:56:23.775]  Um, that's it for this hour.
[01:56:23.775 --> 01:56:34.206]  Remember, make sure you trust the government, take all the vaccines, so if you don't end up with a brain-damaged child, you end up with one that's dead.
[01:56:34.206 --> 01:56:38.470]  And when you talk about it, they'll call you a hate monger.
[01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:42.475]  Just remember, Cuomo on CNN says, let your daughter
[01:56:43.942 --> 01:56:48.525]  Unaccompanied, by herself, be with men in showers that are 30 years old.
[01:56:48.525 --> 01:56:50.867]  Because... He's Cuomo.
[01:56:50.867 --> 01:56:52.428]  And you're not.
[01:56:52.428 --> 01:56:56.311]  And his brother legalized killing babies after birth and harvesting them.
[01:56:56.311 --> 01:57:00.054]  He's so with the program.
[01:57:00.054 --> 01:57:01.575]  We love Cuomo!
[01:57:01.575 --> 01:57:02.796]  We love him down here!
[01:57:02.796 --> 01:57:04.957]  We can't wait till he's in here with us!
[01:57:04.957 --> 01:57:09.581]  Anyways, there you go.
[01:57:10.646 --> 01:57:12.667]  Well, a little blip into Cuomo.
[01:57:12.667 --> 01:57:16.088]  Cuomo's like, will I feel good, Master, if I do bad things?
[01:57:16.088 --> 01:57:17.829]  Yes, you will, Cuomo.
[01:57:17.829 --> 01:57:19.630]  Be bad like your family.
[01:57:19.630 --> 01:57:21.450]  Be bad like your family.
[01:57:21.450 --> 01:57:22.451]  I will be.
[01:57:22.451 --> 01:57:25.252]  I want to be bad.
[01:57:25.252 --> 01:57:27.913]  Good, good.
[01:57:27.913 --> 01:57:32.675]  You may now arrive, Darth Cuomo.
[01:57:32.675 --> 01:57:37.017]  A powerful Sith you will become.
[01:57:41.650 --> 01:57:43.172]  Yes!
[01:57:43.172 --> 01:57:45.314]  Your children are ours!
[01:57:50.051 --> 01:57:53.072]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:57:53.072 --> 01:57:59.515]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[01:57:59.515 --> 01:58:14.980]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:18.722]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[01:58:20.546 --> 01:58:28.593]  With 14 servings per box for a two-week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[01:58:28.593 --> 01:58:34.998]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[01:58:34.998 --> 01:58:37.019]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[01:58:37.019 --> 01:58:39.582]  Perk up with TurboForce at infowarrestore.com.
[01:58:49.952 --> 01:58:55.574]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:58:55.574 --> 01:58:58.715]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:58:58.715 --> 01:59:01.376]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:59:01.376 --> 01:59:05.678]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:59:05.678 --> 01:59:13.181]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[01:59:13.181 --> 01:59:15.602]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[01:59:19.019 --> 01:59:20.880]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:21.681]  They called it U.N.
[01:59:21.681 --> 01:59:23.982]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[01:59:23.982 --> 01:59:24.683]  2030 Agenda.
[01:59:24.683 --> 01:59:36.190]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[01:59:36.190 --> 01:59:38.472]  It's the David Knight Show!
[01:59:38.472 --> 01:59:40.953]  Never miss your show, any day.
[01:59:40.953 --> 01:59:41.814]  I mean, what?
[01:59:41.814 --> 01:59:42.374]  I mean, never!
[01:59:51.317 --> 02:00:03.425]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:03.425 --> 02:00:08.549]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.107 --> 02:00:20.309]  Ain't no stinkin' robot singin' like Merle Haggard.
[02:00:20.309 --> 02:00:21.510]  The desert's quiet.
[02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:24.652]  Cleveland's cold.
[02:00:24.652 --> 02:00:27.314]  And so the story is we're told.
[02:00:27.314 --> 02:00:32.436]  I don't need your prayers, it's true.
[02:00:32.436 --> 02:00:36.379]  But save a few for the lefty too.
[02:00:36.379 --> 02:00:40.201]  He only did what he had to do.
[02:00:40.201 --> 02:00:41.822]  And now he's grown old.
[02:00:43.155 --> 02:00:54.119]  You know, I don't hate humanity.
[02:00:54.119 --> 02:00:58.541]  As fallen as we are, I can see our real form.
[02:00:58.541 --> 02:00:59.261]  Incredible.
[02:00:59.261 --> 02:01:00.542]  Light.
[02:01:00.542 --> 02:01:01.282]  And so...
[02:01:07.305 --> 02:01:20.632]  Everything you're seeing is a multi-thousand year plan to try to sucker us before we get our birthright, before we cross the River Jordan into the real promised land.
[02:01:20.632 --> 02:01:24.054]  Everything is an attempt to steal that because that's powerful.
[02:01:24.054 --> 02:01:27.996]  The only power the devil has is to try to swindle our free will to join him.
[02:01:31.192 --> 02:01:36.276]  I'm not going to play this until after our guest is gone, because I've got to find the right clip to do it for some comic relief here.
[02:01:36.276 --> 02:01:38.477]  This is how my weird brain works.
[02:01:38.477 --> 02:01:46.943]  Remember in Caddyshack, which is the greatest film ever made, from a joke perspective, it's intentional, unintentional comedy.
[02:01:46.943 --> 02:01:52.647]  You've got the crazy greenskeeper, and he says, I want you to go kill all the gophers.
[02:01:52.647 --> 02:01:54.988]  And he says, I can't do that, I'll go to prison.
[02:01:54.988 --> 02:01:56.029]  Not golfers, gophers!
[02:01:59.730 --> 02:02:06.314]  He's there dropping rabbits and squirrels that are actually C4 into the holes.
[02:02:06.314 --> 02:02:12.097]  He's saying, hello Mr. Golfer, Mr. Squirrel here, not plastic explosive or anything.
[02:02:12.097 --> 02:02:17.300]  Excuse me.
[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:19.021]  And then it comes to this point.
[02:02:24.246 --> 02:02:38.174]  That fit into the last thing I just covered with the Nest, the Amazon Nest, the AI Nest in your house, spying on you that other hackers can then jump in on.
[02:02:38.174 --> 02:02:41.936]  Floor lamp sparks privacy concerns.
[02:02:41.936 --> 02:02:43.517]  Back of the camera shot, please.
[02:02:43.517 --> 02:02:45.098]  Of course.
[02:02:45.098 --> 02:02:48.520]  It's not a floor lamp.
[02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:59.637]  It's an I-G-I-G-A, we're going to use a Star Wars analogy, assassination droid.
[02:02:59.637 --> 02:03:00.397]  I'm sorry.
[02:03:00.397 --> 02:03:08.063]  You know, I bragged the other day that I haven't gotten sick in years, but everybody's got this mold and cedar allergy.
[02:03:08.063 --> 02:03:12.206]  The headlines are, Austin schools closed due to flu, but I talked to the parents.
[02:03:12.206 --> 02:03:14.308]  There's no flu to speak of.
[02:03:14.308 --> 02:03:18.451]  It's all the horrible allergies that are being triggered by the fact that our
[02:03:19.642 --> 02:03:24.446]  Immune systems are in such problems, such crises, that it's been triggering a larger crisis.
[02:03:24.446 --> 02:03:25.947]  But let me compose myself.
[02:03:25.947 --> 02:03:28.009]  Here's a good break.
[02:03:28.009 --> 02:03:45.624]  Again, you just go to buy a lamp, but it's actually a camera and microphone watching everything you do with a predisposed system to jack into your Wi-Fi, which you allow it to do, to then send back your entire room in HD.
[02:03:48.663 --> 02:03:53.744]  But that's what you call a lamp now, where you won't be able to go out and get a lamp or get a toaster.
[02:03:53.744 --> 02:03:58.786]  Remember what the director of the CIA seven years ago in Wired Magazine said?
[02:03:58.786 --> 02:04:02.787]  He said, in the future, your toaster will be spying on you.
[02:04:02.787 --> 02:04:04.467]  People said, oh, that's insane.
[02:04:04.467 --> 02:04:05.267]  Jones is insane.
[02:04:05.267 --> 02:04:06.408]  He said that was coming.
[02:04:06.408 --> 02:04:07.208]  That's the plan.
[02:04:08.544 --> 02:04:13.367]  There's going to be a whole new market in trying to get things that aren't washing and controlling you.
[02:04:13.367 --> 02:04:25.674]  It's like, you know, they've attacked the same... Jones says that... No, I don't say that... They tested in Minnesota like six years ago, in the police department of all places.
[02:04:25.674 --> 02:04:31.298]  Lights that flicker at a rate that interface with a computer device that then sends data over power lines.
[02:04:33.740 --> 02:04:38.765]  And of course it uses like a radar system to then give them a 360 view of what's happening inside the police station.
[02:04:38.765 --> 02:04:43.690]  You know, why would the police take... see... Does it sound like humans cooked this up, does it?
[02:04:43.690 --> 02:04:45.372]  I don't think so.
[02:04:45.372 --> 02:04:47.494]  I'm not sure exactly what's going on.
[02:04:47.494 --> 02:04:50.978]  But I think it's got little horns and a little forked tail.
[02:04:50.978 --> 02:04:53.020]  At least that's what they see on TNT.
[02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:54.661]  These little buggers are giving us a problem.
[02:04:59.062 --> 02:05:02.084]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:05:02.084 --> 02:05:08.529]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[02:05:08.529 --> 02:05:24.000]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.743]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!

[02:05:37.603 --> 02:05:44.008]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[02:05:44.008 --> 02:05:46.010]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[02:05:46.010 --> 02:05:48.592]  Perk up with TurboForce at Infowarestore.com.
[02:06:49.926 --> 02:07:00.292]  Seems like it happened yesterday, but it happened almost two weeks ago.
[02:07:00.292 --> 02:07:07.857]  The Covington Catholic School was there at the DC mall for the giant... In fact, I saw them on the war room this morning playing it.
[02:07:07.857 --> 02:07:15.281]  Can somebody find that huge footage of like a million people marching for life, got almost no corporate coverage.
[02:07:15.281 --> 02:07:17.843]  And then there was that local Catholic school from Kentucky.
[02:07:19.451 --> 02:07:25.593]  They screamed at by the black Israelites that they were subhuman garbage, wouldn't have their organs harvested, that the black kids with them were going to go to hell.
[02:07:25.593 --> 02:07:32.735]  They had the Native American elder, the professional troublemaker, going over in the middle trying to get a fight going.
[02:07:32.735 --> 02:07:34.036]  And that was a false flag.
[02:07:34.036 --> 02:07:36.417]  That was a staged event.
[02:07:36.417 --> 02:07:43.439]  One of the thousands of hate crimes that happen every year and 99% where the police just by default
[02:07:44.215 --> 02:07:44.795]  No, it's fake.
[02:07:44.795 --> 02:07:54.161]  When there's a cross burning, or someone spray paints queer on someone's dorm wall, or the Naval Academy, or the Air Force Academy.
[02:07:54.161 --> 02:07:56.783]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[02:07:56.783 --> 02:08:01.446]  So you've got the Catholic School folks and others out there for the March for Life.
[02:08:01.446 --> 02:08:04.328]  Big, giant, some say a million people, who knows.
[02:08:04.328 --> 02:08:08.430]  But there's the footage of the March for Life, if you're a TV viewer.
[02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:09.051]  It's massive.
[02:08:09.051 --> 02:08:12.133]  If you're a radio listener, we have live streams at infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:08:13.849 --> 02:08:18.330]  I started hearing about this three days ago, and I see the media all breathless about it.
[02:08:18.330 --> 02:08:24.732]  And I look how it's a guy who's not even really a B-list actor, and they're trying to hype him up, and it's Chicago where it came out of.
[02:08:24.732 --> 02:08:40.417]  And if 99% of these are fake, I think it's pretty fair, you know, to question that Jesse Mullet, I'm sorry, his name is Schmuttmullet, declares justice will be served as probe into attack continues.
[02:08:42.617 --> 02:08:43.818]  And the police went and got the footage.
[02:08:43.818 --> 02:08:45.720]  There's no guys in Ski Mask.
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:47.981]  There's no one attacking him where he said it happened.
[02:08:47.981 --> 02:08:49.202]  And they're certainly not white.
[02:08:49.202 --> 02:08:59.330]  And he didn't tell them up front with, you know, standard mugging there in Chicago, Muggerland, in the South Side.
[02:08:59.330 --> 02:09:05.175]  He didn't first say it was white guys that called him the N-word and then said, you know, make America great or whatever.
[02:09:06.172 --> 02:09:09.354]  But see, oh, he's black, and it's homophobic.
[02:09:09.354 --> 02:09:20.320]  So, it's like the tribal elder, the elder, was surrounded by a mob of white supremist demons.
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:21.741]  But he stood his ground.
[02:09:21.741 --> 02:09:24.602]  Actually, he went over and confronted them, and they were being really, really nice to him.
[02:09:26.152 --> 02:09:33.318]  I'm questioning if this is part two of all of that, when we have such a long history of that.
[02:09:33.318 --> 02:09:48.750]  But regardless, it's certainly a false flag now when leftist woman in training to appear and act like a delusional crack whore, Ellen Page, says Trump pints responsible for attack on Empire actor.
[02:09:49.753 --> 02:09:55.116]  Because you know, 98% of blacks are killed by other black people, that's if they get out of the womb.
[02:09:55.116 --> 02:10:01.780]  Half of the poor folks are killed before they ever get out of the womb, usually by white doctors, but no one seems to think that's racist.
[02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:08.604]  Okay, I don't want to kill black people or anybody else, but I sure as hell don't like blacks being turned into political weapon against me, and like the new KKK on PCP!
[02:10:10.831 --> 02:10:15.833]  But I mean, you know, again, so she's crying, you've got this poor man!
[02:10:15.833 --> 02:10:22.396]  He's being attacked like the native elder!
[02:10:22.396 --> 02:10:26.217]  He's an elder!
[02:10:26.217 --> 02:10:29.198]  And then you've got Bill Maher like, who wants to screw these kids?
[02:10:29.198 --> 02:10:30.239]  I like to screw other kids.
[02:10:30.239 --> 02:10:31.860]  They're like, screw kids!
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:33.060]  Yeah, screw kids!
[02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:33.980]  Abort them all!
[02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:34.941]  Kill them after they're born!
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.581]  If you look at her, she's an actress.
[02:10:38.581 --> 02:10:40.922]  She's up there.
[02:10:40.922 --> 02:10:43.063]  She's taking her dead grandmother out.
[02:10:43.063 --> 02:10:45.884]  Can you imagine what it's like?
[02:10:45.884 --> 02:10:48.486]  Black people are under total siege by the KKK.
[02:10:48.486 --> 02:10:55.649]  It's terrible.
[02:10:55.649 --> 02:10:56.710]  This is serious, folks.
[02:10:58.200 --> 02:11:02.782]  So, see, when I'm sincere, it's totally sincere, it looks awesome because it's real.
[02:11:02.782 --> 02:11:06.524]  But when I'm trying to be insincere, fake, I can't be fake like her.
[02:11:06.524 --> 02:11:07.985]  Just look at this crap!
[02:11:07.985 --> 02:11:10.506]  If you're a TV viewer, this is unbelievable garbage.
[02:11:10.506 --> 02:11:14.809]  So I thought I would just mention that here's just the latest.
[02:11:14.809 --> 02:11:17.750]  There have been over 100 hate crime hoaxes in the past decade.
[02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:19.051]  These are documented ones.
[02:11:19.051 --> 02:11:26.855]  Remember some guy was trumping over Jewish tombstones in New Jersey and spray-painting Nazi crap, and I said, you're in the wrong team as a liberal.
[02:11:27.662 --> 02:11:29.403]  Trump said, I bet it's staged.
[02:11:29.403 --> 02:11:32.985]  He had to have a State of the Union early and say, I believe Jews get attacked.
[02:11:32.985 --> 02:11:35.667]  Of course there's real people attacking Jews, but this one was staged.
[02:11:35.667 --> 02:11:37.128]  It was staged.
[02:11:37.128 --> 02:11:38.668]  But no one got into the retraction.
[02:11:38.668 --> 02:11:44.552]  Or the Air Force Cadet Commandant going, we don't put up with the racism of America.
[02:11:44.552 --> 02:11:46.333]  America sucks!
[02:11:46.333 --> 02:11:47.714]  And our Air Force sucks!
[02:11:49.031 --> 02:11:52.072]  But I'm here to demoralize you so autonomous weapons systems can take over.
[02:11:52.072 --> 02:11:57.194]  The larger global plan I've been promised, AI superstructure, once I've sold you out to the interdimensional forces we're working with.
[02:11:57.194 --> 02:11:59.555]  Excuse me, I'm sorry.
[02:11:59.555 --> 02:12:04.977]  We've got someone who put an N-word on the water cooler down there at the vending machine.
[02:12:04.977 --> 02:12:09.019]  The entire Air Force sucks, and humans in control of machines suck.
[02:12:09.019 --> 02:12:10.719]  Give full AI control.
[02:12:10.719 --> 02:12:12.000]  Yes, Lord, I've got your back.
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.380]  Thank you, sir.
[02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:16.161]  I'm a general now, but not for you.
[02:12:16.161 --> 02:12:17.382]  So, that's what this is.
[02:12:19.039 --> 02:12:23.602]  And that's all this is, is a bunch of traitors working with the devil.
[02:12:23.602 --> 02:12:24.702]  It's all there in the Bible.
[02:12:24.702 --> 02:12:26.143]  Interdimensional attack.
[02:12:26.143 --> 02:12:28.945]  And notice, they won't criticize me in the media for this.
[02:12:28.945 --> 02:12:36.189]  Oh, they make up all this wild stuff I've never said, but they won't touch this because they're on their knees taking hallucinogens every day.
[02:12:37.229 --> 02:12:38.830]  To just get the next message.
[02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:40.671]  Oh, please give me another transmission.
[02:12:40.671 --> 02:12:43.332]  Oh, oh, Vathomet, please.
[02:12:43.332 --> 02:12:45.393]  Oh, I just took 20 hits of acid.
[02:12:45.393 --> 02:12:46.973]  Please, Lord.
[02:12:46.973 --> 02:12:49.334]  Please give me the next vision.
[02:12:49.334 --> 02:12:51.235]  That's their Holy Ghost.
[02:12:51.235 --> 02:12:54.336]  And they get more and more captured by this, but they're also scared.
[02:12:54.336 --> 02:13:01.139]  You don't think the devil with his invasion force has generals that have souls or are in command?
[02:13:01.139 --> 02:13:02.760]  All their generals are pathetic worms.
[02:13:04.144 --> 02:13:06.186]  Because they're not leaders.
[02:13:06.186 --> 02:13:07.788]  The devil has slaves.
[02:13:07.788 --> 02:13:10.510]  God produces leaders.
[02:13:10.510 --> 02:13:12.953]  See, I want to join that operation.
[02:13:12.953 --> 02:13:15.796]  And I have joined the operation, don't worry.
[02:13:15.796 --> 02:13:19.580]  But, you have to understand, you have to face evil if you're going to do that.
[02:13:20.752 --> 02:13:23.313]  And I will tell you a little bit of rubs off on you.
[02:13:23.313 --> 02:13:27.094]  I hope at some point I'll be cleansed of the memories of this.
[02:13:27.094 --> 02:13:30.515]  If I go to the next level, I really do not like rubbing up against these people.
[02:13:30.515 --> 02:13:32.676]  It's not been fun.
[02:13:32.676 --> 02:13:34.537]  But we've done it.
[02:13:34.537 --> 02:13:36.937]  And I'm jacked into what they're doing right now.
[02:13:36.937 --> 02:13:38.118]  And let me just say.
[02:13:39.568 --> 02:13:41.590]  They want your kids.
[02:13:41.590 --> 02:13:45.353]  The demon, it wants pure energy.
[02:13:45.353 --> 02:13:47.455]  It wants pure God potential.
[02:13:47.455 --> 02:13:48.475]  Blueprint of the universe.
[02:13:48.475 --> 02:13:50.317]  God puts in every soul of a human.
[02:13:50.317 --> 02:13:53.299]  And a child is so innocent and so powerful.
[02:13:53.299 --> 02:13:55.581]  It's like zombies want brains.
[02:13:55.581 --> 02:13:57.483]  Globalists want children.
[02:13:57.483 --> 02:13:59.044]  It's just how it works.
[02:13:59.044 --> 02:14:01.646]  Because they don't have brains, they want brains.
[02:14:01.646 --> 02:14:03.007]  They don't have innocence, they want innocence.
[02:14:03.007 --> 02:14:04.208]  You understand?
[02:14:04.208 --> 02:14:04.929]  Like Moth to Flame.
[02:14:06.454 --> 02:14:19.918]  So, let's go out to break with this terrible actress, Ellen Page, launching a false flag that even if this black guy got attacked, which obviously looks like it's fake, she is, oh my God, there's this epidemic.
[02:14:19.918 --> 02:14:21.179]  She knows full well what she's doing.
[02:14:21.179 --> 02:14:22.519]  So the false flag is blaming Trump.
[02:14:22.519 --> 02:14:23.539]  Here it is.
[02:14:23.539 --> 02:14:26.100]  I'm like really fired up tonight.
[02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:27.280]  This is how you have to be fired.
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:30.041]  It feels impossible to not feel this way right now.
[02:14:30.041 --> 02:14:31.262]  My God, yeah.
[02:14:31.262 --> 02:14:34.363]  Vice President Mike Pence who like wishes I couldn't be married.
[02:14:34.363 --> 02:14:35.263]  Let's just be clear.
[02:14:36.519 --> 02:14:37.660]  Oh my God, he's stopping me!
[02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:38.440]  Oh, give me a break!
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:40.001]  As if anybody gives a damn about you, lady.
[02:14:40.001 --> 02:14:40.301]  Nooooo!
[02:14:40.301 --> 02:14:43.082]  What she wants is you not to have kids.
[02:14:59.633 --> 02:15:00.934]  How many SSRIs do you think she's on?
[02:15:00.934 --> 02:15:01.395]  She's so unattractive.
[02:15:15.559 --> 02:15:17.580]  You want to cause suffering to them?
[02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:19.481]  Like newborn, unborn babies?
[02:15:19.481 --> 02:15:22.223]  You spend your career trying to cause suffering.
[02:15:22.223 --> 02:15:23.024]  Well I guess newborn babies.
[02:15:23.024 --> 02:15:24.224]  What do you think is going to happen?
[02:15:30.788 --> 02:15:35.230]  She doesn't say a word about Google running slave camps in China, or funding the Arab Spring.
[02:15:35.230 --> 02:15:39.391]  She doesn't care about radical Muslims cutting millions of women's genitals off, throwing gays off buildings.
[02:15:39.391 --> 02:15:42.393]  She's just like, Trump wants to rape gay people!
[02:15:42.393 --> 02:15:45.494]  That's why he waved rainbow flags at the convention!
[02:15:45.494 --> 02:15:47.335]  Help us, please!
[02:15:47.335 --> 02:15:50.336]  Trump's here, he's attacking me!
[02:15:50.336 --> 02:15:51.796]  Help me, I'm a wiener!
[02:15:55.268 --> 02:15:59.131]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[02:15:59.131 --> 02:16:04.114]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[02:16:04.114 --> 02:16:08.937]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[02:16:15.982 --> 02:16:18.283]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[02:16:25.228 --> 02:16:26.449]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:26.449 --> 02:16:30.371]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.371 --> 02:16:31.912]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:31.912 --> 02:16:34.874]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:34.874 --> 02:16:40.438]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:40.438 --> 02:16:41.639]  I can help you, too.

[02:19:05.976 --> 02:19:10.258]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:19:10.258 --> 02:19:13.739]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.

[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:36.074]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:20:07.116 --> 02:20:14.241]  We've got it.
[02:20:14.241 --> 02:20:18.624]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:18.624 --> 02:20:24.928]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:24.928 --> 02:20:27.589]  Alright, joining us for the next few segments is...
[02:20:28.850 --> 02:20:30.111]  The Bulldog!
[02:20:30.111 --> 02:20:31.332]  I'm taking action, Laura Loomer.
[02:20:31.332 --> 02:20:33.193]  By the way, my nickname with George Norris is the Bulldog.
[02:20:33.193 --> 02:20:34.994]  I kind of look like a bulldog, too.
[02:20:34.994 --> 02:20:37.295]  She doesn't look like a bulldog, but today she's like a bulldog.
[02:20:37.295 --> 02:20:40.597]  We'll talk to her in a moment about her latest exploits in the fight for freedom.
[02:20:40.597 --> 02:20:42.078]  But first, they're telling me to play this.
[02:20:42.078 --> 02:20:47.281]  We're trying to bring back some of the old school stuff from 77 trillion years ago, two years ago.
[02:20:47.281 --> 02:20:52.904]  One of the fidget spinner videos that got over 100 million views total, which they've deleted off the internet now because...
[02:20:53.484 --> 02:20:55.165]  You know, it's funny and they like it.
[02:20:55.165 --> 02:20:56.567]  This had over 100 million views.
[02:20:56.567 --> 02:20:57.307]  It's been deleted.
[02:20:57.307 --> 02:20:59.289]  So here it is from the vault.
[02:20:59.289 --> 02:21:02.932]  It's a little shortened piece about, we love our Somalis.
[02:21:02.932 --> 02:21:04.974]  We love our Muslims too.
[02:21:04.974 --> 02:21:05.914]  Oh, they so good.
[02:21:05.914 --> 02:21:06.655]  Oh, they so sweet.
[02:21:22.772 --> 02:21:23.697]  I'm good.
[02:21:45.518 --> 02:21:46.139]  I think?
[02:22:07.378 --> 02:22:21.282]  Now, that's fun to cover, but Laura Loomer going to Nancy Pelosi's house and then going to, I guess, her nephew's house, who is the true American psycho, way beyond Christian Bale and Bill Hemmer, who also looks like an American psycho.
[02:22:21.282 --> 02:22:25.303]  I mean, and I got to tell you about the new governor of California.
[02:22:25.303 --> 02:22:28.784]  Reportedly, because, you know, I know this from
[02:22:30.580 --> 02:22:31.560]  From his ex-wife.
[02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:34.642]  He has a two foot long, you know what?
[02:22:34.642 --> 02:22:38.663]  So, I'm not really, this is a family show, but now they can cuss on national TV, let me tell you.
[02:22:38.663 --> 02:22:41.644]  So I guess psychopaths also have like elephant trunk proboscises.
[02:22:41.644 --> 02:22:45.506]  I don't know why I'm telling this now, but I guess that's what psychopaths have, I'm sorry.
[02:22:45.506 --> 02:22:47.627]  She went to his house, not in search of that.
[02:22:47.627 --> 02:22:51.909]  She went to his house because, well, he says no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[02:22:51.909 --> 02:22:59.812]  Here is Laura Loomer getting arrested there, near the lair of the male genitals known as Godzilla.
[02:22:59.812 --> 02:23:00.132]  Here it is.
[02:23:01.627 --> 02:23:02.608]  He wants to protect illegals?
[02:23:02.608 --> 02:23:05.930]  He wants to give aid and comfort to illegals?
[02:23:05.930 --> 02:23:09.572]  How much money is spent on illegal immigration here in California?
[02:23:09.572 --> 02:23:10.273]  $22 billion?
[02:23:10.273 --> 02:23:10.653]  $23 billion?
[02:23:10.653 --> 02:23:11.694]  It's $23 billion.
[02:23:11.694 --> 02:23:12.634]  $23 billion a year?
[02:23:12.634 --> 02:23:13.395]  In California?
[02:23:13.395 --> 02:23:14.035]  In California.
[02:23:14.035 --> 02:23:22.041]  So what I want to know is why is it not okay to come over Gavin Newsom's fence, but it's okay to come over
[02:23:23.024 --> 02:23:25.926]  The United States border.
[02:23:25.926 --> 02:23:27.827]  Seems kind of hypocritical, right?
[02:23:27.827 --> 02:23:35.513]  You guys, Gavin Newsom is arresting me.
[02:23:35.513 --> 02:23:39.756]  So I've been arrested here at Gavin Newsom's mansion, the governor's mansion.
[02:23:39.756 --> 02:23:42.598]  Gavin Newsom is Nancy Pelosi's nephew.
[02:23:42.598 --> 02:23:44.819]  And look, I thought that everyone was welcome here.
[02:23:44.819 --> 02:23:52.385]  They spend $23 billion a year on illegal immigration here in California alone, over $220 billion nationally, illegally.
[02:23:52.685 --> 02:23:58.087]  You're welcome here and the Democrats will give you free health care, free housing on the taxpayer dime, right?
[02:23:58.087 --> 02:24:01.389]  We just wish we could do that job for all the illegals that are coming into our country.
[02:24:01.389 --> 02:24:01.669]  Right.
[02:24:01.669 --> 02:24:02.709]  That'd be awesome.
[02:24:02.709 --> 02:24:08.151]  As an American, you're not allowed to hop over Gavin Newsom's fence or Nancy Pelosi's fence to get handcuffed and arrested.
[02:24:08.151 --> 02:24:16.975]  But if you're an illegal alien or you're a rapist or you kill innocent police officers or you murder and rape women here, you have to be welcomed here.
[02:24:17.555 --> 02:24:23.159]  So look at guys, look, this is a perfect example of what Donald Trump is trying to champion, all right?
[02:24:23.159 --> 02:24:24.740]  America first, right?
[02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:29.804]  You have an American citizen, a journalist being arrested outside Gavin Newsom's yard.
[02:24:29.804 --> 02:24:36.569]  But then all the illegal aliens here, the illegal aliens who hopped the fence at Nancy Pelosi's place last week were not arrested.
[02:24:36.569 --> 02:24:37.569]  And they're here illegally.
[02:24:37.569 --> 02:24:37.749]  My hat.
[02:24:40.211 --> 02:24:41.732]  Illegals hop our borders.
[02:24:41.732 --> 02:24:43.494]  Put my hat back on.
[02:24:43.494 --> 02:24:46.977]  And you know, look, the Democrats, they don't want to compromise with Donald Trump.
[02:24:46.977 --> 02:24:51.281]  They don't want to compromise with our great president, Donald Trump, who's trying to improve border security.
[02:24:51.281 --> 02:24:52.302]  Yeah, that's my ID.
[02:24:52.302 --> 02:24:54.244]  You can put all my stuff back in.
[02:24:54.244 --> 02:24:57.186]  They don't want to compromise, but they're hypocrites, you guys.
[02:24:57.186 --> 02:24:59.989]  Democrats didn't want to compromise.
[02:24:59.989 --> 02:25:02.471]  We spent $23 billion a year on illegal debris.
[02:25:02.651 --> 02:25:04.832]  So that's lauraloomer.us for radio listeners.
[02:25:04.832 --> 02:25:16.458]  And I don't usually get crude about things, but I know, you know, reportedly the ex-wife of this American psycho Gavin Newsom, the new governor, that he literally was genetically engineered to rape America.
[02:25:16.458 --> 02:25:19.919]  So that's why I brought that whole allegory up to troll the media.
[02:25:19.919 --> 02:25:21.320]  But seriously, Laura, we're going to go to break.
[02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:21.920]  Come back in a minute.
[02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:23.281]  You got like four minutes here.
[02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:23.561]  Wow.
[02:25:23.561 --> 02:25:30.124]  You went to Pelosi's house, didn't have a problem, but you went to the American psycho's facility, went over the little three foot fence.
[02:25:30.124 --> 02:25:31.405]  The police immediately responded.
[02:25:32.065 --> 02:25:34.600]  Pelosi and others have said walls are immoral.
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:35.304]  They shouldn't exist.
[02:25:37.392 --> 02:25:46.180]  Yeah, it's really interesting to show that comparison, and there's a reason why I didn't bring illegal aliens with me to Gavin Newsom's home at the Governor's Mansion in California.
[02:25:46.180 --> 02:25:53.307]  It's because I wanted to show the difference, to prove that illegal aliens matter more than American citizens.
[02:25:53.307 --> 02:26:02.496]  A week and a half ago, I went to Nancy Pelosi's mansion in Napa Valley and hopped over her fence with actual illegal aliens from Guatemala and Mexico who I picked up at the Home Depot.
[02:26:03.096 --> 02:26:10.419]  And when the police showed up, right, they said that Nancy Pelosi was going to have us cited for trespassing, but we weren't arrested.
[02:26:10.419 --> 02:26:14.881]  And I said all along it was probably because the optics of it were so bad.
[02:26:14.881 --> 02:26:24.686]  And Nancy Pelosi, who always says everyone's welcome here and that a wall is an immorality, didn't want to have the optics of having three illegal aliens arrested at her multi-million dollar mansion.
[02:26:25.246 --> 02:26:29.689]  So then I thought I said to myself, well, what's going to happen if I go to Casa de Gavin?
[02:26:29.689 --> 02:26:34.992]  Because Gavin Newsom, for those of you who don't know, is Nancy Pelosi's nephew by marriage.
[02:26:34.992 --> 02:26:38.375]  And so there's a lot of incest in the Democrat Party, right?
[02:26:38.375 --> 02:26:46.200]  You have a lot of these politicians who are connected through marriages or some relationship whatsoever.
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:50.763]  And then that's why you you have a lot of this
[02:26:52.369 --> 02:26:52.549]  Yes.
[02:27:04.462 --> 02:27:10.526]  So when I went to Gavin Newsom's home, I set up a sanctuary state fair and I brought some people with me.
[02:27:10.526 --> 02:27:19.171]  I was with Ben Burquam from Frontline America, which is a group, of course, that exposes a lot of these immigration issues across our country.
[02:27:19.171 --> 02:27:26.896]  And we hopped over Gavin Newsom's fence after we brought the infamous immorality tent and placed it in his lawn.
[02:27:26.896 --> 02:27:33.881]  And what happened is he not only had a fence, but he had armed guards, police officers on his property because, well, he is the governor of California.
[02:27:34.561 --> 02:27:35.822]  And I was arrested.
[02:27:35.822 --> 02:27:44.906]  You can see in the video I was handcuffed and I was taken away to the Sacramento County Jail, which is one of the, from what I'm told, one of the top worst jails in America.
[02:27:44.906 --> 02:27:46.227]  And it's funny, right?
[02:27:46.227 --> 02:27:52.550]  It's funny how illegal aliens were not arrested, but then I get arrested simply for standing on some grass.
[02:27:53.414 --> 02:27:54.975]  And I want to know, right?
[02:27:54.975 --> 02:28:06.485]  I really want to know when Gavin Newsom is finally going to take care of American citizens, because the cost of illegal immigration alone in California every year is $23 billion and climbing, alright?
[02:28:06.485 --> 02:28:08.967]  No, I agree with you, and I shouldn't even have joked up front.
[02:28:08.967 --> 02:28:11.570]  We post a video later, I may even edit that out because the crew's teasing me.
[02:28:12.170 --> 02:28:34.191]  Because I know inside baseball about him and Gilfoyle and all these other women and it's like it's the big joke that he literally wants to rape America and it's like he literally looks like what what American psycho wishy looks like I mean I would run from that dude I mean I'm like not afraid of dudes but I would actually be afraid to run away he's so evil it's like like this I think he may actually be Satan what do you think?
[02:28:35.410 --> 02:28:40.072]  I mean, I don't really care how big a schlong is, because if you're a D, I don't want your D, right?
[02:28:40.072 --> 02:28:41.752]  I mean, I would never... No, I understand.
[02:28:41.752 --> 02:28:49.715]  The whole schlong thing is only because it's not been reported yet, and we have broken that a schlong is actually codenamed Godzilla, and that it wants to rape America.
[02:28:49.715 --> 02:28:50.255]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:50.255 --> 02:28:50.755]  Stay with us.

[02:32:04.024 --> 02:32:08.006]  Because everybody else, they put in a little bit of product and then they do a bunch of advertising and promote it.
[02:32:08.006 --> 02:32:09.226]  The turmeric in this is 95% curcuminoid.

[02:32:54.226 --> 02:32:58.708]  You need to try TurboForce today!
[02:32:58.708 --> 02:33:01.329]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.680 --> 02:33:21.750]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:25.941]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:45.524 --> 02:33:55.936]  Alright, um, Harrison Smith, one of our great researchers, and one of the film hosts here, just brought me intel that I actually thought about last week.
[02:33:55.936 --> 02:33:58.259]  And it's just totally profound, and it's true.
[02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:03.781]  And it's so big, I have trouble even just kind of even covering it here on air.
[02:34:03.781 --> 02:34:11.723]  I'm like, wow, this should take months of research and should be presented at the National Archives or at the Press Club and with great officiation.
[02:34:11.723 --> 02:34:14.104]  But I'm going to do it next segment after Laura Loomer leaves.
[02:34:14.104 --> 02:34:15.284]  And I apologize to listeners.
[02:34:15.284 --> 02:34:17.085]  And I mean that.
[02:34:17.085 --> 02:34:18.245]  You get the truth out of me.
[02:34:18.245 --> 02:34:19.345]  There's no teleprompters.
[02:34:19.345 --> 02:34:21.186]  There's no producers controlling me.
[02:34:21.186 --> 02:34:25.827]  Sometimes I careen off course like a runaway train that's jumped the tracks.
[02:34:27.338 --> 02:34:33.144]  Because I just know so much stuff I can't even tell you, and I really do want to.
[02:34:33.144 --> 02:34:37.989]  But Laura Loomer, who, again, I call the bulldog.
[02:34:37.989 --> 02:34:39.451]  She doesn't look like a bulldog.
[02:34:39.451 --> 02:34:40.332]  I look like a bulldog.
[02:34:40.332 --> 02:34:42.154]  I've been called the bulldog by George Floyd and others.
[02:34:42.154 --> 02:34:43.015]  But she's intrepid.
[02:34:43.015 --> 02:34:49.882]  I don't know anybody that's got the bravado.
[02:34:51.401 --> 02:34:55.886]  To go out there and do it, but it's not born out of the gut of confidence, it's born out of necessity.
[02:34:55.886 --> 02:35:00.169]  Being censored, being lied about, being demonized, she has a lot of tenacity.
[02:35:00.169 --> 02:35:07.036]  Going to Pelosi's house, where they have all these walls and gates, and going to Twitter, all the things she's done.
[02:35:07.036 --> 02:35:10.139]  Going up there when they're having plays about killing Trump and jumping up on stage.
[02:35:10.139 --> 02:35:12.921]  I mean, there's too much to mention.
[02:35:12.921 --> 02:35:15.283]  You should go to her website, you should support her.
[02:35:15.283 --> 02:35:16.645]  We try to support her as much as we can.
[02:35:19.046 --> 02:35:22.790]  But just getting back to the issue, Ron, I shouldn't make jokes about Newsom, which is actually a true joke.
[02:35:22.790 --> 02:35:24.792]  I was told by multiple women.
[02:35:24.792 --> 02:35:29.216]  It's interesting to let him know that I'm inside his head, I'm inside his life, I know everything.
[02:35:29.216 --> 02:35:31.338]  That was really a little shot across the bow to him.
[02:35:31.338 --> 02:35:32.539]  Because I know about the other stuff too, buddy.
[02:35:32.539 --> 02:35:33.400]  Get ready.
[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:36.302]  You know Stone already took down the governor of New York.
[02:35:36.302 --> 02:35:37.323]  Get ready, buddy, buddy.
[02:35:37.323 --> 02:35:37.824]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:35:37.824 --> 02:35:38.664]  Control yourself.
[02:35:38.664 --> 02:35:40.106]  Please control yourself.
[02:35:40.765 --> 02:35:42.687]  Control yourself.
[02:35:42.687 --> 02:35:43.348]  Sorry!
[02:35:43.348 --> 02:35:45.550]  Can you make a Laura Loomer?
[02:35:45.550 --> 02:35:56.001]  So, Laura, you did a great job, and you got arrested, so I know they can charge you with, uh, with, uh, well, with what?
[02:35:56.001 --> 02:35:57.903]  With trespassing in America, I guess.
[02:35:59.534 --> 02:36:02.635]  Yeah, I was charged with trespassing by a misdemeanor.
[02:36:02.635 --> 02:36:07.978]  So I have to actually go back to court on February 28th in Sacramento.
[02:36:07.978 --> 02:36:09.198]  And who knows what's going to happen?
[02:36:09.198 --> 02:36:09.538]  I don't know.
[02:36:09.538 --> 02:36:14.181]  But they actually held me inside this jail cell for about eight hours.
[02:36:14.181 --> 02:36:17.002]  And so it was pretty gross because the cell was really dirty.
[02:36:17.002 --> 02:36:25.025]  I was surrounded by a bunch of drug addicts, people who were having withdrawals from heroin, which probably came across our southern border if you want to get down to it.
[02:36:25.025 --> 02:36:28.347]  And, you know, there wasn't any toilet paper and people were like,
[02:36:29.113 --> 02:36:29.454]  I don't
[02:36:47.157 --> 02:36:51.720]  I guess acceptable to the Democrats here for people to just pop a squat and poop on the sidewalk.
[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:59.465]  So they now have cleanup crews in San Francisco because people are pooping all over the streets and Gavin Newsom isn't doing anything about it.
[02:36:59.465 --> 02:37:06.249]  And you are also now legally allowed to shoot a heroin on the side of the street and the Democrats will provide you free needles on behalf.
[02:37:06.249 --> 02:37:07.370]  Well, they're not really free, right?
[02:37:07.370 --> 02:37:11.433]  Because there's no such thing as free like the socialists would like you to believe.
[02:37:11.433 --> 02:37:13.694]  Let me talk about the amazing.
[02:37:13.694 --> 02:37:14.275]  Who are these?
[02:37:14.995 --> 02:37:19.842]  Really cool, like, great-looking ladies, awesome, you know, handsome black dudes.
[02:37:19.842 --> 02:37:21.784]  Who is this crew of fans you had out there?
[02:37:21.784 --> 02:37:25.329]  Because I saw the longer, like, hours of video before and after.
[02:37:25.329 --> 02:37:28.413]  These are some really talented, smart people you had with you.
[02:37:28.413 --> 02:37:29.074]  Who are these folks?
[02:37:30.417 --> 02:37:33.199]  Yeah, so my crew, of course, I have a camera crew.
[02:37:33.199 --> 02:37:35.681]  I work with guys from Folklore Americana.
[02:37:35.681 --> 02:37:42.225]  And then there's another girl from Instagram I know, a great girl, FogCityMidge, if you're not already following her.
[02:37:42.225 --> 02:37:46.548]  She is, well, was the Nancy Pelosi impersonator.
[02:37:46.548 --> 02:37:52.832]  And you may have seen one of her recent videos where she went to the Women's March with another guy, David Harris, who was also there.
[02:37:52.832 --> 02:37:53.932]  And they wore MAGA hats.
[02:37:53.932 --> 02:37:59.336]  And they got some feminists on camera who were basically going crazy over the MAGA hats, these bald feminists.
[02:37:59.776 --> 02:38:00.096]  I think so.
[02:38:21.986 --> 02:38:23.367]  Latin America is collapsing.
[02:38:23.367 --> 02:38:24.508]  All this is happening.
[02:38:24.508 --> 02:38:26.369]  We're just pointing out that walls work.
[02:38:26.369 --> 02:38:28.371]  It's okay to have walls or doors.
[02:38:28.371 --> 02:38:32.914]  All these politicians calling for no wall are obsessed with security and walls.
[02:38:32.914 --> 02:38:35.116]  How are the cops behaving once you got in a squad car with them?
[02:38:36.044 --> 02:38:40.129]  Oh, they were apologizing for arresting me because they're like, look, we just have to do our job.
[02:38:40.129 --> 02:38:40.910]  But they were fans.
[02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:46.057]  And actually, when I got to the when I got to the police station, some of the officers were like, Oh, my God, it's Laura Loomer.
[02:38:46.057 --> 02:38:48.140]  I follow you on Instagram and Facebook.
[02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:49.922]  And so some of these officers were my fans.
[02:38:49.922 --> 02:38:52.966]  And they were telling me how much they thought my video at Nancy Pelosi places.
[02:38:53.306 --> 02:38:53.887]  Hilarious.
[02:38:53.887 --> 02:38:58.651]  And then when Ben and I were in jail getting booked, you know, they were like, oh, what are these guys here for?
[02:38:58.651 --> 02:39:00.773]  Oh, why is he wearing a Trump is your president shirt?
[02:39:00.773 --> 02:39:01.954]  What they do.
[02:39:01.954 --> 02:39:05.217]  And then I was still wearing my poncho, of course.
[02:39:05.217 --> 02:39:15.226]  And then when the officers told them that we hopped over Gavin Newsom's fence and we're protesting illegal immigration, all of the officers in the booking area in the jail started chanting, build a wall.
[02:39:15.626 --> 02:39:19.307]  I wish I had a camera to record this, but can you imagine this?
[02:39:19.307 --> 02:39:25.710]  I'm in handcuffs and I'm getting booked in jail, and the officers are telling us, good job, good job, and they're chanting, build the wall.
[02:39:25.710 --> 02:39:31.272]  See, Laura, that's the angle that you're a smart lady, smarter than I am anyways, but that's like all the angles are.
[02:39:31.272 --> 02:39:36.413]  The cops on average get the BS because they get lied about constantly because the left wants control of them.
[02:39:36.413 --> 02:39:43.716]  Not that cops are perfect, they're like everybody else, they're multifaceted, but the left wants to bully police to get control of it because then we get a Soviet Union.
[02:39:44.336 --> 02:39:45.997]  And they get the crime.
[02:39:45.997 --> 02:39:49.379]  The Mexicans that are Americans, they get that they want people vetted.
[02:39:49.379 --> 02:39:51.000]  They don't want their kids in schools.
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.902]  You know, they're 90% Hispanic and half the folks are citizens.
[02:39:53.902 --> 02:39:56.383]  The other half aren't with TB and all this crap.
[02:39:56.383 --> 02:39:57.704]  I mean, people get it.
[02:39:57.704 --> 02:40:00.986]  They came here to get away from the worst dregs.
[02:40:00.986 --> 02:40:05.849]  And then people that came here legally are like called collaborators and stuff.
[02:40:05.849 --> 02:40:06.570]  Well, no, we want
[02:40:07.210 --> 02:40:13.895]  The coal miners, and the scientists, and the doctors, and the farmers, and the school teachers from Mexico or Guatemala.
[02:40:13.895 --> 02:40:16.497]  We don't want your meth-head lazy-asses.
[02:40:16.497 --> 02:40:19.279]  And most of the folks doing this, this whole caravan, are.
[02:40:19.279 --> 02:40:23.202]  Most of them are muelling drugs while they're at it.
[02:40:23.202 --> 02:40:26.804]  Right, but it's not even just about Mexicans and Guatemalan people.
[02:40:26.804 --> 02:40:29.046]  That's why I wore the sombrero and the poncho.
[02:40:29.046 --> 02:40:35.250]  It's because the Democrats have turned this into a, oh, well, if you oppose... No, like 20% is other than Mexican in the filing.
[02:40:35.250 --> 02:40:35.971]  They're Islamists.
[02:40:37.337 --> 02:40:47.540]  There's a lot of Muslims in the caravan too, and they're finding prayer rugs and Qurans in the desert, and there's a lot of ISIS terrorists and Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists who are working with the cartel.
[02:40:47.540 --> 02:40:50.321]  And by the way, finding a Quran, I'm done.
[02:40:50.321 --> 02:40:51.461]  I didn't want to have the wars.
[02:40:51.461 --> 02:40:54.482]  I'm not against the Muslims, but they take over countries.
[02:40:54.482 --> 02:40:55.983]  They don't let us live in their countries.
[02:40:55.983 --> 02:40:59.304]  So if you find a Quran, it's like finding a cancer cell.
[02:41:00.956 --> 02:41:01.656]  Right.
[02:41:01.656 --> 02:41:03.417]  I mean, look, we shouldn't be allowing this.
[02:41:03.417 --> 02:41:11.963]  And so by polarizing this issue and making it all about the Mexicans and trying to accuse Trump of being racist, right, they're ignoring.
[02:41:11.963 --> 02:41:16.185]  You saw Nancy Pelosi- Oh, by the way, Mexico is one of the richest countries in Latin America.
[02:41:16.185 --> 02:41:17.126]  It's on the upper end.
[02:41:17.126 --> 02:41:18.947]  I love Mexico.
[02:41:18.947 --> 02:41:21.028]  I wish Mexico was richer than the U.S.
[02:41:21.028 --> 02:41:22.409]  It's beautiful, great people.
[02:41:22.409 --> 02:41:23.229]  I love Mexicans.
[02:41:23.229 --> 02:41:23.910]  I love their food.
[02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:24.590]  I love it all.
[02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:25.531]  I love the vibe.
[02:41:25.531 --> 02:41:29.433]  I just wish they didn't have this 1% that are murdering killers that nobody can stop.
[02:41:30.438 --> 02:41:45.403]  Yeah, and so that's why we wear ponchos and stuff to poke fun at the left, because they're obsessed with this idea that it's just Mexicans, and they don't seem to understand that people from all backgrounds and all countries around the world, especially Islamic terrorists, are using our border to come in and bomb America.
[02:41:45.403 --> 02:41:46.003]  Well, let's just admit it.
[02:41:46.003 --> 02:41:49.784]  Wearing a festive sombrero, it just, it means you're about to have some fun.
[02:41:49.784 --> 02:41:53.005]  I mean, let's, the Mexicans know how to have fun, let's not lie.
[02:41:54.376 --> 02:42:08.180]  We had a fiesta in La Casa De Nancy and I told people, I told you Alex live on the show about what a week and a half ago I said we were gonna go to La Casa De Gavin and have another fiesta and I invited you so maybe next time you'll come and hang out with me.
[02:42:08.180 --> 02:42:09.221]  Believe me I want to.
[02:42:09.221 --> 02:42:12.962]  The enemy has me pinned down here which is a real joy let me tell you.
[02:42:13.642 --> 02:42:14.783]  And so we'll do it.
[02:42:14.783 --> 02:42:16.524]  Laura Loomer, we salute you.
[02:42:16.524 --> 02:42:23.088]  And I want to invite you with your great work on the War Room today when Roger Stone comes out exclusively, whether he's gagged or not.
[02:42:23.088 --> 02:42:25.990]  And then I want to invite you on the David Knight Show.
[02:42:25.990 --> 02:42:29.993]  He's out with a heart attack, but he'll be back soon with some of the crew in the morning.
[02:42:29.993 --> 02:42:30.793]  We salute you.
[02:42:30.793 --> 02:42:32.054]  And so I know you have your main site.
[02:42:32.054 --> 02:42:33.435]  Is the new site Laura Loomer?
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:38.904]  Yeah, it's LauraLoomer.us and I have been permanently banned from Twitter, of course.
[02:42:38.904 --> 02:42:40.665]  So if you want to follow me, you can follow me.
[02:42:40.665 --> 02:42:46.410]  I'm on Instagram, at Loomer, but I want people to subscribe to my website if you scroll down to the bottom.
[02:42:46.410 --> 02:42:47.150]  Sure, absolutely.
[02:42:47.150 --> 02:42:49.793]  Listen, we need more people like you.
[02:42:49.793 --> 02:42:52.235]  You are definitely the cutting edge.
[02:42:52.235 --> 02:42:53.716]  You are the devil's spear, bulldog.
[02:42:57.970 --> 02:43:01.011]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:43:01.011 --> 02:43:07.453]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[02:43:07.453 --> 02:43:22.899]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[02:43:22.899 --> 02:43:26.640]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[02:43:28.464 --> 02:43:36.511]  With 14 servings per box for a two-week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[02:43:36.511 --> 02:43:42.916]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[02:43:42.916 --> 02:43:44.937]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[02:43:44.937 --> 02:43:47.500]  Perk up with TurboForce at infowarrestore.com.
[02:43:54.932 --> 02:44:04.237]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:44:04.237 --> 02:44:07.099]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:44:07.099 --> 02:44:13.143]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:44:13.803 --> 02:44:20.069]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:44:20.069 --> 02:44:26.354]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:44:26.354 --> 02:44:33.300]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:44:34.441 --> 02:44:47.452]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:44:47.452 --> 02:44:51.715]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:44:51.715 --> 02:44:56.119]  X3, now available at mfortworthslife.com.
[02:44:56.119 --> 02:44:59.982]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[02:45:01.351 --> 02:45:10.034]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[02:45:10.034 --> 02:45:12.015]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[02:45:12.015 --> 02:45:15.476]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[02:45:15.476 --> 02:45:18.097]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[02:45:18.097 --> 02:45:20.378]  So we've already had incredible success.
[02:45:20.378 --> 02:45:27.341]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[02:45:27.901 --> 02:45:37.685]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[02:45:37.685 --> 02:45:38.845]  We'll win.
[02:45:38.845 --> 02:45:41.766]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[02:45:41.766 --> 02:45:48.909]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart, get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce, and your right to the market.
[02:45:48.909 --> 02:45:52.610]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[02:45:52.610 --> 02:45:53.830]  This is InfoWars' Darkness Howard.
[02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:55.031]  We need your support.
[02:45:55.031 --> 02:45:55.571]  I'm counting on you.
[02:45:56.071 --> 02:46:00.313]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:46:00.313 --> 02:46:03.795]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:46:03.795 --> 02:46:05.556]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:46:05.556 --> 02:46:08.838]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:46:08.838 --> 02:46:15.621]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:46:15.621 --> 02:46:20.704]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[02:46:21.044 --> 02:46:27.147]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:46:27.147 --> 02:46:30.128]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:46:30.128 --> 02:46:31.228]  I want to keep going.
[02:46:31.228 --> 02:46:35.050]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:46:35.050 --> 02:46:37.071]  I want to push all the way.
[02:46:37.071 --> 02:46:38.352]  I've committed to do that.
[02:46:38.352 --> 02:46:39.432]  I've prayed for that.
[02:46:39.432 --> 02:46:41.073]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:46:41.073 --> 02:46:43.514]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:46:44.014 --> 02:46:45.314]  I will never falter.
[02:46:45.314 --> 02:46:47.655]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:46:47.655 --> 02:46:48.595]  I physically will.
[02:46:48.595 --> 02:46:59.677]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then 444.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:46:59.677 --> 02:47:07.858]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:07.858 --> 02:47:11.859]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[02:47:13.834 --> 02:47:18.538]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[02:47:18.538 --> 02:47:24.104]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[02:47:24.104 --> 02:47:28.888]  He said, it's a long walk to Nashville, would you like to ride?
[02:47:28.888 --> 02:47:31.551]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:31.551 --> 02:47:36.696]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:47:38.980 --> 02:47:41.521]  Oh yeah, there's something strange.
[02:48:05.566 --> 02:48:09.108]  Can you make folks feel what they feel inside?
[02:48:09.108 --> 02:48:13.290]  See, all I'm doing is making you feel what you feel inside.
[02:48:23.083 --> 02:48:25.464]  It's all I tell you, it's what you already know.
[02:48:25.464 --> 02:48:28.226]  I'm just here to say, you know it's the right thing to do.
[02:48:28.226 --> 02:48:28.767]  To this.
[02:48:28.767 --> 02:48:28.967]  Ha!
[02:48:28.967 --> 02:48:31.748]  The whole world calls me Hank!
[02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:57.371]  Have you paid your dues?
[02:48:57.371 --> 02:49:07.417]  Can you bend them guitar strings?
[02:49:07.417 --> 02:49:08.938]  Is your big star bound?
[02:49:08.938 --> 02:49:10.699]  Let me warn you, it's a long, hard drive.
[02:49:10.699 --> 02:49:13.740]  Alright, that's enough of that.
[02:49:13.740 --> 02:49:16.602]  Here's what's gonna happen.
[02:49:16.602 --> 02:49:20.704]  Let me tell you, Nick Begich has been on fire in Fuego.
[02:49:20.704 --> 02:49:21.925]  Absolutely dominating.
[02:49:23.078 --> 02:49:29.542]  And I don't like to take his time up when he's all linebackered up and ready to really take it to the enemy.
[02:49:29.542 --> 02:49:31.204]  But I'm going to do it.
[02:49:31.204 --> 02:49:42.051]  Because in all of my puling and mumbling, which does happen in all of the inane babble, there's some key words they do pick up in there.
[02:49:42.051 --> 02:49:46.114]  I needed some documents printed before I covered this and that has not happened yet.
[02:49:46.114 --> 02:49:49.796]  Because you know I neurotically do not want to just tell you something.
[02:49:49.796 --> 02:49:52.098]  I want to show you part of where I got it.
[02:49:54.551 --> 02:50:02.417]  So, I've already said this to the President in person, and he didn't listen to me.
[02:50:02.417 --> 02:50:05.859]  Or maybe he did, but they didn't do what he said once he gave the orders.
[02:50:05.859 --> 02:50:19.348]  But there's nothing more frustrating than sitting here with platinum victory in your little hands.
[02:50:19.348 --> 02:50:20.229]  In your hands.
[02:50:20.229 --> 02:50:21.210]  In your hands, thank you.
[02:50:22.625 --> 02:50:23.985]  I want to come back to all the other articles.
[02:50:23.985 --> 02:50:25.346]  Thanks.
[02:50:25.346 --> 02:50:31.008]  Having platinum victory in your hands and everybody just thinks it's more of the chatter.
[02:50:31.008 --> 02:50:40.211]  But you notice the globalists are crapping themselves to use family parlance to get me off the air.
[02:50:40.211 --> 02:50:43.792]  And I'm going to say it again.
[02:50:43.792 --> 02:50:49.133]  I don't believe the globalists are that smart.
[02:50:49.133 --> 02:50:51.134]  I don't believe you're that stupid.
[02:50:53.510 --> 02:51:11.286]  That we have this information and that if they shut me down, it's shut down when these pieces of crap are executing this information in front of everybody.
[02:51:11.286 --> 02:51:15.209]  But I'll cover it at the start of the next hour.
[02:51:15.209 --> 02:51:16.290]  And I'm going to go through it all.
[02:51:16.290 --> 02:51:19.253]  But you've already heard it before.
[02:51:19.253 --> 02:51:20.594]  But the stars just aligned.
[02:51:22.073 --> 02:51:35.440]  Do you know why there have been layoffs at more than 20 major leftist fake news publications from BuzzFeed to Newsweek to Vice?
[02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:38.421]  Why did it all happen this week?
[02:51:38.421 --> 02:51:41.743]  Why didn't it happen a month ago or a month from now?
[02:51:41.743 --> 02:51:43.464]  Why wasn't it doled out?
[02:51:43.464 --> 02:51:46.485]  Because it's concerted.
[02:51:49.162 --> 02:51:56.113]  It's like a bombing run with a group of bombers flying in and they've all got targets.
[02:51:56.113 --> 02:51:58.276]  And they're all commanded by their HQ.
[02:51:58.276 --> 02:51:58.496]  See?
[02:52:01.733 --> 02:52:04.775]  And by the way, I don't just think that.
[02:52:04.775 --> 02:52:06.016]  I have their blueprint.
[02:52:06.016 --> 02:52:07.296]  I have their bombing run.
[02:52:07.296 --> 02:52:09.457]  I have their attack profile.
[02:52:09.457 --> 02:52:12.839]  I have their Achilles.
[02:52:12.839 --> 02:52:18.883]  And I'm here telling you their Achilles.
[02:52:18.883 --> 02:52:20.724]  I'm here telling you how to defeat them.
[02:52:23.399 --> 02:52:29.344]  Because I learned to study what the actual controllers do.
[02:52:29.344 --> 02:52:33.988]  And you say, well, they shouldn't make it public then.
[02:52:33.988 --> 02:52:42.715]  But something that big has a structure.
[02:52:42.715 --> 02:52:46.278]  Something that big has a wavelength.
[02:52:46.278 --> 02:52:50.522]  Something that big has a signature.
[02:52:50.522 --> 02:52:51.623]  A slither.
[02:52:53.550 --> 02:52:56.412]  Real intelligence is observation.
[02:52:56.412 --> 02:52:58.994]  Real intelligence is infiltration.
[02:52:58.994 --> 02:53:04.897]  Real intelligence is interfacing, banging heads with your enemy.
[02:53:04.897 --> 02:53:12.022]  Because you begin to know your enemy better than the enemy knows you.
[02:53:12.022 --> 02:53:17.726]  All real warfare that's victorious is psychic.
[02:53:17.726 --> 02:53:20.808]  It can be physical, but that's only to draw out
[02:53:21.954 --> 02:53:27.417]  Essence of the enemy's goals and their fears.
[02:53:27.417 --> 02:53:35.022]  And then the commitment to meet your enemy with your goals and your love.
[02:53:35.022 --> 02:53:36.243]  Love trumps all.
[02:53:37.403 --> 02:53:43.626]  But you have to realistically have the template of victory to be able to take it on.
[02:53:43.626 --> 02:54:00.753]  You can't counter a civilizational ending event, a planned viral demolition of humanity, a Earth-ending termination of the birth of a new species, a new vision, a new world, a new galaxy, a new universe.
[02:54:00.753 --> 02:54:06.616]  You can't counter something like that with lack of vision.
[02:54:07.930 --> 02:54:09.651]  Simply countering their program.
[02:54:09.651 --> 02:54:21.756]  You must offer the world that you see and see if others believe in that world and see how they will then offer information to that world to build a new, better world.
[02:54:21.756 --> 02:54:24.937]  You have to recruit in a war.
[02:54:24.937 --> 02:54:32.040]  And to do that, you need to look for people that aren't just trying to be in charge of something.
[02:54:32.040 --> 02:54:35.422]  You need to look for people that want to be involved in something.
[02:54:36.678 --> 02:54:43.500]  Involved in something bigger than them, not because they want to rule people, but because they love people.
[02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:53.382]  Because they love their ancestors, and they love humanity, and they have a vision that they want to add to in the future.
[02:54:53.382 --> 02:54:58.464]  So that all the victories and the successes of our progeny, when we're the ancestors,
[02:55:02.090 --> 02:55:19.761]  To those people in the future and the incredible challenges they face and the struggles and the love and the passion and the will as we become stronger and stronger and stronger, but then face greater and greater obstacles.
[02:55:19.761 --> 02:55:21.762]  Can you imagine that?
[02:55:21.762 --> 02:55:25.965]  I want my guts, my will,
[02:55:28.752 --> 02:55:30.353]  To be with those people.
[02:55:30.353 --> 02:55:31.815]  It's not out of some arrogance.
[02:55:31.815 --> 02:55:32.675]  It's out of love.
[02:55:32.675 --> 02:55:35.377]  It's not wanting to be in a tomb forever and dead.
[02:55:35.377 --> 02:55:39.341]  It's wanting to be with my family forever.
[02:55:39.341 --> 02:55:41.583]  It's wanting to be with you forever.
[02:55:41.583 --> 02:55:42.904]  I want to live with you forever.
[02:55:43.712 --> 02:56:04.929]  I want my genetics and my will and my spirit to commune with you forever and to experience all the majesty, all the things God has planned for us in that banquet that goes on, but the challenges that God faces and the missions God has for us in this little tinker toy level of a joke, just the first level.
[02:56:04.929 --> 02:56:10.633]  I'm not even sure that we get to higher levels that I'll even make the grade to be with you.
[02:56:10.633 --> 02:56:11.294]  That's a big deal.
[02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:16.623]  I'm too much like the enemy, the final equation.
[02:56:16.623 --> 02:56:23.588]  In fact, I predict that at the end of the final analysis, I may not even be with you, but it doesn't matter.
[02:56:23.588 --> 02:56:25.010]  God uses evil for good.
[02:56:26.198 --> 02:56:28.359]  As the propulsion system of the future.
[02:56:28.359 --> 02:56:30.780]  And that's why these Satanists fear me so much.
[02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:33.060]  Because they've bet on this planet.
[02:56:33.060 --> 02:56:34.881]  And they've bet on their takeover.
[02:56:34.881 --> 02:56:36.122]  And they think they're victorious.
[02:56:36.122 --> 02:56:40.363]  And that's why I hate to plug products and the things we sell.
[02:56:40.363 --> 02:56:42.704]  But everything we sell is good.
[02:56:42.704 --> 02:56:45.805]  It's the best there is at the price it's at.
[02:56:45.805 --> 02:56:54.148]  And it funds what we're doing that's so fundamentally radical against the spirit of this world that it shakes the enemies of humanity to their very core.
[02:56:59.406 --> 02:57:03.010]  And that's why I know we're going to win in the end.
[02:57:03.010 --> 02:57:07.015]  But I want to ask you to commit by word of mouth and by prayer.
[02:57:07.995 --> 02:57:32.076]  In the public realm and in personal soul, but also in the physical, the energy you expend every day in the system to transfer part of that to us, to know that there is a full commitment to push our will against the enemy with everything we've got and to lean in when their knives are stabbing into our guts, to lean into their hate and just lean in and take it.
[02:57:32.837 --> 02:57:33.978]  I'm ready.
[02:57:33.978 --> 02:57:35.539]  And I'll lean in and I'll take it.
[02:57:35.539 --> 02:57:41.644]  But I need your backing so that when I swing my sword, it'll absolutely devastate the enemy.
[02:57:41.644 --> 02:57:44.626]  When I raise my shield, it's your will that empowers it.
[02:57:47.984 --> 02:57:51.025]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:57:51.025 --> 02:57:57.466]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[03:00:05.086 --> 03:00:09.471]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:09.471 --> 03:00:14.918]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:14.918 --> 03:00:18.202]  Is this some conspiracy?
[03:00:18.202 --> 03:00:20.384]  Crucified for no sins!
[03:00:29.278 --> 03:00:35.080]  I was rereading these documents last week, up here late at night.
[03:00:35.080 --> 03:00:38.121]  And I meant to do a whole show on it.
[03:00:38.121 --> 03:00:40.842]  But I got distracted.
[03:00:40.842 --> 03:00:43.143]  I got diverted.
[03:00:43.143 --> 03:00:45.444]  And I didn't cover it.
[03:00:45.444 --> 03:00:50.786]  And then, Harrison Smith has been hosting David Knight's show, Great Research Reporter.
[03:00:50.786 --> 03:00:54.728]  He came to me about 45 minutes ago and he said, have you seen this?
[03:00:54.728 --> 03:00:55.368]  Have you seen this?
[03:00:56.868 --> 03:01:00.830]  And I said, yeah, I actually have seen that.
[03:01:00.830 --> 03:01:03.791]  And he said, nobody's talking about this.
[03:01:03.791 --> 03:01:05.952]  And that's so frustrating.
[03:01:05.952 --> 03:01:12.254]  Because we have their program in our hands.
[03:01:12.254 --> 03:01:15.075]  And we know what they did.
[03:01:15.075 --> 03:01:16.775]  We know how they ran it.
[03:01:16.775 --> 03:01:21.697]  We know the scandal of Obama putting billions
[03:01:24.963 --> 03:01:34.230]  Billions of dollars into the Defense Department before he left.
[03:01:34.230 --> 03:01:38.173]  A time bomb to do what you've seen happen.
[03:01:38.173 --> 03:01:38.954]  And you know what?
[03:01:38.954 --> 03:01:44.158]  I am so glad they expended 80% of their propellant on me.
[03:01:44.158 --> 03:01:47.321]  Let me tell you, I feel damn good right now.
[03:01:48.393 --> 03:01:55.502]  That they spent most the money and that's all they could do was get us off all these.
[03:01:55.502 --> 03:02:00.629]  But see that shows how scared they are because the old days they could send hitmen around to kill people, but they know everything surveilled.
[03:02:00.629 --> 03:02:01.650]  They're all dishonorable.
[03:02:01.650 --> 03:02:05.495]  They all tattle on each other and they know how other things work.
[03:02:07.073 --> 03:02:09.195]  People do things if they do things.
[03:02:09.195 --> 03:02:16.081]  And so, they tried to assassinate my name and my character, and now you see the layoffs.
[03:02:16.081 --> 03:02:22.486]  And they happened the week that the funding ended.
[03:02:22.486 --> 03:02:23.807]  And that's why funding's so important.
[03:02:23.807 --> 03:02:30.493]  You know, I did two hours, and I just, you know, I can't do it.
[03:02:30.493 --> 03:02:33.315]  Because you have ads that come on for radio networks and all the rest of it.
[03:02:33.315 --> 03:02:34.476]  That doesn't bring in any of our funding.
[03:02:36.205 --> 03:02:38.847]  I'm covering some super hardcore thing.
[03:02:38.847 --> 03:02:42.909]  I just can't go, oh, by the way, let me tell you about fish oil.
[03:02:42.909 --> 03:02:47.371]  Even though, fundamentally, I want to say brain force is great.
[03:02:47.371 --> 03:02:50.473]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:02:50.473 --> 03:02:52.754]  It is.
[03:02:52.754 --> 03:03:00.598]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:03:00.598 --> 03:03:01.879]  The fish oil's better than it.
[03:03:03.632 --> 03:03:06.333]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:03:06.333 --> 03:03:09.555]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:03:09.555 --> 03:03:12.036]  Brain, body, heart.
[03:03:12.036 --> 03:03:15.658]  And we've got the best without all the mercury.
[03:03:15.658 --> 03:03:19.079]  Very expensive to produce to have the mercury taken out.
[03:03:19.079 --> 03:03:21.140]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[03:03:21.140 --> 03:03:23.762]  We've got the children's.
[03:03:23.762 --> 03:03:25.402]  We've got the adults.
[03:03:25.402 --> 03:03:26.243]  We've got the krill oil.
[03:03:27.806 --> 03:03:30.128]  And yeah, you know, they have the denatured stuff.
[03:03:30.128 --> 03:03:31.909]  They claim it doesn't give you burpees.
[03:03:31.909 --> 03:03:36.032]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[03:03:36.032 --> 03:03:40.895]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:03:40.895 --> 03:03:43.237]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this?
[03:03:43.237 --> 03:03:45.538]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:03:45.538 --> 03:03:47.700]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:03:47.700 --> 03:03:49.601]  It's so good in my view.
[03:03:49.601 --> 03:03:52.743]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:03:52.743 --> 03:03:53.864]  I eat five capulets.
[03:03:56.783 --> 03:04:02.728]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:04:02.728 --> 03:04:10.254]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:04:10.254 --> 03:04:16.298]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:04:16.298 --> 03:04:18.380]  I just can't do it!
[03:04:18.380 --> 03:04:19.901]  See, there's evil that lies constantly.
[03:04:19.901 --> 03:04:21.622]  I can't lie.
[03:04:21.622 --> 03:04:22.003]  Seriously.
[03:04:23.035 --> 03:04:29.016]  And I was telling you, fish oil is like, everybody knows it, everybody's like, God, I ate a big fish tonight, I had some incredible dreams, I feel great.
[03:04:29.016 --> 03:04:30.657]  Fish is magic.
[03:04:30.657 --> 03:04:33.677]  Fish is incredible, and this is concentrated.
[03:04:33.677 --> 03:04:40.499]  Ultimate krill oil, explosive, insane, psychoactive to the maximum, it is next level.
[03:04:40.499 --> 03:04:47.001]  And then you've got the well-crafted ultimate fish oil, it's amazing, and you've got, you've got the honor roll for children, which...
[03:04:56.909 --> 03:04:59.950]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:04:59.950 --> 03:05:06.391]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[03:05:06.391 --> 03:05:21.855]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[03:05:21.855 --> 03:05:25.596]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[03:05:27.409 --> 03:05:35.471]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.

[03:05:41.852 --> 03:05:43.872]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[03:05:43.872 --> 03:05:46.413]  Perk up with TurboForce at infowarrestore.com.
[03:06:08.317 --> 03:06:13.274]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:31.306 --> 03:06:33.647]  It's Friday, February 1st, 2019.
[03:06:33.647 --> 03:06:45.492]  Dr. Nick Begich, one of the top scientists out there exposing the globalists, decades before it became cool, takes over in the next segment.
[03:06:45.492 --> 03:06:49.214]  But, I'll tell you why I love our crew.
[03:06:49.214 --> 03:06:52.816]  Because I'm about to break down something that is beyond central.
[03:06:53.922 --> 03:07:07.665]  Beyond core, it's key, meaning it turns the lock, it changes the paradigm, it is victory.
[03:07:07.665 --> 03:07:12.606]  Trump's strength is also his greatest weakness.
[03:07:12.606 --> 03:07:14.707]  That's how paradoxes work.
[03:07:14.707 --> 03:07:16.247]  He never ran for political office.
[03:07:21.064 --> 03:07:24.806]  He aspired to the highest position in the land.
[03:07:24.806 --> 03:07:27.648]  He was able to make a lot of major deals work.
[03:07:27.648 --> 03:07:29.509]  He turned the country around.
[03:07:29.509 --> 03:07:30.790]  He got us out of the TPP.
[03:07:30.790 --> 03:07:33.572]  He got some decent judges appointed.
[03:07:33.572 --> 03:07:40.597]  He got millions of jobs back, but they raised the interest rates and killed the recovery.
[03:07:40.597 --> 03:07:47.341]  But my biggest frustration is in my conversations with the president.
[03:07:47.341 --> 03:07:50.083]  And if I brought it up, man, the lawyers break in on the phone.
[03:07:51.397 --> 03:07:52.918]  That's all our phone calls been monitored.
[03:07:52.918 --> 03:07:56.099]  He's like, just a minute, please.
[03:07:56.099 --> 03:07:58.540]  Comes back a minute later.
[03:07:58.540 --> 03:08:01.202]  That's when I say, Mr. President.
[03:08:01.202 --> 03:08:03.663]  Embedded stay behind networks by Obama.
[03:08:03.663 --> 03:08:04.583]  Two billion dollars.
[03:08:04.583 --> 03:08:07.785]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act were established.
[03:08:07.785 --> 03:08:12.347]  Hundreds of millions of dollars was paid to operations against you.
[03:08:12.347 --> 03:08:16.629]  It is the scandal that will bring them down, sir.
[03:08:16.629 --> 03:08:17.530]  Very interesting, Alex.
[03:08:17.530 --> 03:08:18.770]  How do you know that, sir?
[03:08:18.770 --> 03:08:19.931]  It's in the legislation.
[03:08:22.523 --> 03:08:24.744]  People around you are scared.
[03:08:24.744 --> 03:08:27.306]  They're hedging their bets for their families.
[03:08:27.306 --> 03:08:31.508]  Your only way out of this is to go completely at them head on.
[03:08:31.508 --> 03:08:33.270]  Well, Alex, I just wanted to thank you.
[03:08:33.270 --> 03:08:34.911]  And can I talk to your wife?
[03:08:34.911 --> 03:08:36.552]  I just got remarried.
[03:08:36.552 --> 03:08:38.132]  Sir, we're talking about your life here.
[03:08:38.132 --> 03:08:41.815]  And then we have a 10 minute conversation when you actually like, let's cut through it.
[03:08:41.815 --> 03:08:43.196]  This is a real conversation.
[03:08:43.196 --> 03:08:44.196]  I'm not here trying to go.
[03:08:44.196 --> 03:08:45.237]  I'm talking to the president.
[03:08:45.237 --> 03:08:47.078]  I'm talking to you about what's about to happen.
[03:08:49.298 --> 03:08:57.851]  And then Trump went and did research and found out I was telling the truth and began demanding briefings daily within six months into office of everything on InfoWars.
[03:08:59.554 --> 03:09:19.806]  That's when Kelly came in and they said we're quote banning Infowars at the White House and that's when the craziness started all the lawsuits and things because they're like what are we gonna do it's like Ronald Reagan when he was reading what people like Congressman McDonald were saying well they just killed McDonald and they killed
[03:09:22.082 --> 03:09:28.324]  At the same time, basically, the father of the man we're about to have on, a famous congressman, who also stood up to this.
[03:09:28.324 --> 03:09:35.386]  So, I want listeners to understand, this isn't Netflix, this isn't movies, this isn't Winnie the Pooh, okay?
[03:09:35.386 --> 03:09:41.608]  This isn't Star Wars.
[03:09:41.608 --> 03:09:47.090]  Luke Skywalker and Han Solo weren't really at Los Elysees Spaceport having that shootout.
[03:09:47.090 --> 03:09:49.951]  But this, this is happening.
[03:09:51.618 --> 03:09:57.565]  So I'm going to have baggage takeover, and I'm going to cover this more in shows tomorrow, emergency broadcasts that are important.
[03:10:00.111 --> 03:10:04.695]  But I noticed this last week when the layoff started and then I forgot to cover it.
[03:10:04.695 --> 03:10:09.900]  And then Harrison Smith, one of our researchers, came to me and he said, have you noticed this?
[03:10:09.900 --> 03:10:11.322]  The Internet's talking about this.
[03:10:11.322 --> 03:10:24.914]  Well, my God, I'm glad they're finally talking about it because they didn't just illegally spy on Trump as a candidate or as the nominee or as president-elect or as president and got caught doing it and got caught trying to wear wires and all this crap.
[03:10:25.891 --> 03:10:29.013]  And lied to Congress, lied to him, lied to the courts.
[03:10:29.013 --> 03:10:30.094]  That's jail time.
[03:10:30.094 --> 03:10:34.477]  Cut and dry.
[03:10:34.477 --> 03:10:37.939]  They didn't just do that.
[03:10:37.939 --> 03:10:48.467]  They put $2 billion in the kitty for all the race war stuff and everything you're seeing.
[03:10:48.467 --> 03:10:53.610]  And $160 million in one fund just to BuzzFeed and CNN.
[03:10:55.091 --> 03:10:57.292]  And they went to these trusted, quote, reporters.
[03:10:57.292 --> 03:10:58.333]  They lined them up.
[03:10:58.333 --> 03:10:59.974]  I talked to folks that were there.
[03:10:59.974 --> 03:11:03.936]  That's why they got so scared and banned me off Twitter when I confronted Oliver Darcy.
[03:11:03.936 --> 03:11:08.278]  And I said, I know you're part of an InfraGard infrastructure.
[03:11:08.278 --> 03:11:16.523]  And I know you've been given a code key and national security clearance into Google, which is really run by the CIA and the NSA.
[03:11:16.523 --> 03:11:17.744]  That's on record.
[03:11:17.744 --> 03:11:18.984]  And I told him the Capitol.
[03:11:18.984 --> 03:11:20.565]  I said, I know you're doing this against me.
[03:11:20.565 --> 03:11:23.807]  And you're a rogue group, which was criminal because it's in the law.
[03:11:26.032 --> 03:11:41.525]  Well it was pointed out to me that last week, and it's in the New York Times right here, document cam shot please, that those billions of dollars divvied up in 150 and 200 million dollar groups was divvied up and ended last week.
[03:11:44.517 --> 03:11:51.079]  The funding all started in late January 2017 and ran for two years.
[03:11:51.079 --> 03:11:52.559]  Trump wouldn't listen.
[03:11:52.559 --> 03:11:54.040]  Trump wouldn't kill it.
[03:11:54.040 --> 03:11:56.101]  He couldn't get the bureaucracy to kill it.
[03:11:56.101 --> 03:12:04.883]  We know they're in full mutiny against him, but still they didn't get the funding re-upped.
[03:12:04.883 --> 03:12:13.826]  So the funding to CNN and BuzzFeed and a bunch of other groups, think of that list, because that's under national security.
[03:12:15.219 --> 03:12:16.500]  That's in defense authorization.
[03:12:16.500 --> 03:12:17.901]  That's secret who the money went to.
[03:12:17.901 --> 03:12:20.643]  We just know who they admitted.
[03:12:20.643 --> 03:12:21.784]  Think about the scandal.
[03:12:21.784 --> 03:12:25.447]  Richard Nixon had a list of 100 people, never used it with the IRS.
[03:12:25.447 --> 03:12:27.348]  They did this.
[03:12:27.348 --> 03:12:29.270]  So here it is.
[03:12:29.270 --> 03:12:30.391]  This is the New York Times.
[03:12:30.391 --> 03:12:30.671]  U.S.
[03:12:30.671 --> 03:12:33.373]  Senate panel okays funds to fight online propaganda.
[03:12:33.373 --> 03:12:36.476]  United States bolters fight against foreign-owned propaganda.
[03:12:36.476 --> 03:12:40.259]  Major Congress passed a portion of the National Defense Authorization Act to poor.
[03:12:42.048 --> 03:12:44.309]  160 million into the effort over two years.
[03:12:44.309 --> 03:12:45.210]  That was two years ago.
[03:12:45.210 --> 03:12:46.670]  There's a glitch today showing the new date.
[03:12:46.670 --> 03:12:49.031]  That's the New York Times, two years ago.
[03:12:49.031 --> 03:12:52.072]  So that funding in H.R.
[03:12:52.072 --> 03:12:54.954]  5181 just ended.
[03:12:54.954 --> 03:12:59.496]  There's the article that Zero Hedge reported on it back in December 2016.
[03:12:59.496 --> 03:13:03.237]  Obama quietly signs the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act.
[03:13:03.237 --> 03:13:09.480]  Because see, the outgoing president, he signs the bill for the next two years.
[03:13:10.754 --> 03:13:14.015]  It always staggers the next two years.
[03:13:14.015 --> 03:13:16.555]  So see?
[03:13:16.555 --> 03:13:17.876]  So that's what you've seen.
[03:13:17.876 --> 03:13:35.500]  This whole thing has been our military interfacing with the newspapers and others to put out all this crazy crap with an elected president fighting propaganda funding
[03:13:37.503 --> 03:13:46.886]  That was put in place in December of 2016 that was enacted three days after he was elected January 23rd, 2017.
[03:13:46.886 --> 03:13:50.327]  This is so epic.
[03:13:50.327 --> 03:13:56.709]  This story that's hiding in plain view that if Trump takes hold of this and takes action and wonders
[03:13:57.349 --> 03:14:00.451]  Because he wouldn't stop it, it was too complex, he wouldn't do it.
[03:14:00.451 --> 03:14:06.094]  But the fact now, that this is known, and that's why the layoffs are happening, it's all confirmed.
[03:14:06.094 --> 03:14:15.239]  Nick Vegas, you're about to take over, but your brother, senator, your father, congressman, you a scientist, just looking at this, how incredible is this?
[03:14:15.239 --> 03:14:20.482]  That Trump didn't take action, but they didn't get it refunded, because Obama wasn't there.
[03:14:20.482 --> 03:14:22.643]  They can't believe they got away with this.
[03:14:22.643 --> 03:14:24.985]  Trump has the keys to victory right here.
[03:14:26.092 --> 03:14:48.100]  Yeah, you know, the whole issue of propaganda, you know, and here it is, you know, in plain sight, like you say, Alex, and, you know, this is the simplest form of manipulation of behavior, mind control, if you will, you know, is the idea that you can use the government, the power of government, to create propaganda.
[03:14:48.100 --> 03:14:50.381]  What does propaganda mean in the 21st century?
[03:14:50.381 --> 03:14:53.662]  It's not just advertising and sloganeering
[03:14:54.282 --> 03:14:59.226]  It's the deeper aspects of manipulating and moving the crowd, so to speak.
[03:14:59.226 --> 03:15:02.269]  So you have the manipulation of big data.
[03:15:02.269 --> 03:15:08.935]  You have the manipulation of information itself and deciding what audiences are going to hear.
[03:15:08.935 --> 03:15:14.460]  All of this sort of feeds that machine.
[03:15:14.460 --> 03:15:17.262]  Sure, but there's the arrogance that they would get away with it.
[03:15:17.262 --> 03:15:21.606]  I mean, the fact that they did it is their waterloo if we just take action.
[03:15:22.788 --> 03:15:41.602]  Right, and you know, the illusion of all this, as we're going into the break, is they created the panic over international terrorism, international drug trafficking, as the prelude, as the precursor to the invasion of this republic through the invasion of our privacy.
[03:15:41.602 --> 03:15:46.726]  EarthPulse.com, EarthPulse.com, Nick Baggage responds to this huge breaking news.

[03:17:22.808 --> 03:17:24.029]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:24.029 --> 03:17:27.951]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:27.951 --> 03:17:29.491]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.491 --> 03:17:32.453]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.453 --> 03:17:38.015]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:38.015 --> 03:17:39.216]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:39.216 --> 03:17:42.137]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[03:19:09.527 --> 03:19:10.767]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:19:10.767 --> 03:19:17.651]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[03:19:17.651 --> 03:19:18.231]  We made it.
[03:19:18.231 --> 03:19:20.392]  And that's really where this goes.
[03:19:20.392 --> 03:19:22.213]  God's got a big war for you, Revy.
[03:19:22.213 --> 03:19:22.573]  And so
[03:19:22.773 --> 03:19:29.379]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[03:19:29.379 --> 03:19:34.303]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[03:19:34.303 --> 03:19:37.166]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:19:37.166 --> 03:19:39.568]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:19:39.568 --> 03:19:43.071]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[03:19:43.071 --> 03:19:44.092]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:19:44.332 --> 03:19:48.594]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[03:19:48.594 --> 03:19:51.495]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[03:19:51.495 --> 03:19:52.575]  I want life!
[03:19:52.575 --> 03:19:57.177]  I want Jesus!
[03:19:57.177 --> 03:19:59.798]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:12.964 --> 03:20:20.593]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:20.593 --> 03:20:26.419]  Alright, you know, you can say people that get too close to the problem, and we're here.
[03:20:26.419 --> 03:20:30.303]  Because we almost become comfortable where we're at, even though it's terrible.
[03:20:30.303 --> 03:20:31.364]  We adapt to being slaves.
[03:20:32.335 --> 03:20:34.316]  As a globalist once told me.
[03:20:34.316 --> 03:20:37.439]  Oh, you won't adapt to defeat us, you'll adapt to being slaves.
[03:20:37.439 --> 03:20:39.881]  Roger Stone has a judge that magically in D.C.
[03:20:39.881 --> 03:20:43.243]  out of 30 judges or so keeps getting chosen.
[03:20:43.243 --> 03:20:47.146]  She gag orders people, she doesn't let them fundraise.
[03:20:47.146 --> 03:20:47.866]  She does all this.
[03:20:47.866 --> 03:20:48.927]  Let me fix my toupee.
[03:20:48.927 --> 03:20:52.910]  I don't actually have a toupee, but might as well.
[03:20:52.910 --> 03:20:56.293]  Judge considers gag order in Roger Stone case.
[03:20:56.293 --> 03:21:00.136]  Roger couldn't believe that actually tried that.
[03:21:00.947 --> 03:21:02.610]  Because he makes a living as a commentator.
[03:21:02.610 --> 03:21:03.932]  He used to be a commentator at Fox News.
[03:21:03.932 --> 03:21:05.695]  He was paid.
[03:21:05.695 --> 03:21:11.184]  Till I hired him a year and a half ago.
[03:21:11.184 --> 03:21:11.584]  So now...
[03:21:13.308 --> 03:21:17.431]  Judge says she's considering imposing a gag order, but hasn't made up her mind yet.
[03:21:17.431 --> 03:21:17.951]  Oh, great.
[03:21:17.951 --> 03:21:19.312]  Yeah, great.
[03:21:19.312 --> 03:21:24.235]  She says she understood Stowe's desire to tell a story, but she had to ensure a fair trial.
[03:21:24.235 --> 03:21:24.755]  That's right.
[03:21:24.755 --> 03:21:27.337]  Let the whole corporate media lie about him.
[03:21:27.337 --> 03:21:31.480]  This is a criminal proceeding and not a public relations campaign.
[03:21:31.480 --> 03:21:36.843]  Well, she could put a gag order on the trial, which is what Mueller is asking for.
[03:21:36.843 --> 03:21:39.205]  But I'm going to go back to this with
[03:21:41.018 --> 03:21:50.665]  Dr. Nick Begich, and I'll let him take over, but it's not like there's all these trillions of voices and all the stuff, and everybody's like, oh, this is that, this is it, whatever.
[03:21:50.665 --> 03:21:52.586]  We're actually in the zeitgeist.
[03:21:52.586 --> 03:21:54.888]  We're what they want shut down.
[03:21:54.888 --> 03:22:01.472]  And you have billions of dollars spent, hundreds of millions per news agency, to put out fake news.
[03:22:01.472 --> 03:22:07.917]  The money ran out last week, so all the layoffs are happening for folks that are on the anti-America beat.
[03:22:09.125 --> 03:22:11.786]  And that's sensational!
[03:22:11.786 --> 03:22:15.908]  We have the keys to their defeat.
[03:22:15.908 --> 03:22:20.830]  And now, we've got... That's why they want us off the air.
[03:22:20.830 --> 03:22:22.811]  They can't believe we have all this proof.
[03:22:22.811 --> 03:22:24.912]  And they can't believe we're still on air.
[03:22:24.912 --> 03:22:30.595]  And then, I told Roger and his lawyers, I said, they're gonna gag your ass, brother.
[03:22:30.595 --> 03:22:32.656]  They said, oh, I can't believe that's so un-American.
[03:22:32.656 --> 03:22:35.597]  Well, get your butt ready.
[03:22:35.597 --> 03:22:37.218]  Get your ass ready.
[03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.570]  Come on in.
[03:22:39.570 --> 03:22:42.052]  Somebody wants to come in the studio?
[03:22:42.052 --> 03:22:43.333]  Come on in.
[03:22:43.333 --> 03:22:46.736]  I know this is used as a pathway in here.
[03:22:46.736 --> 03:22:52.881]  Might as well be the... What old I-35 used to have a name?
[03:22:52.881 --> 03:22:54.122]  The Chisholm Trail.
[03:22:55.478 --> 03:22:57.679]  Right here in the studio is the Chisholm Trail.
[03:22:57.679 --> 03:23:01.880]  Everybody should just march up and down the Chisholm Trail while I'm live on air.
[03:23:01.880 --> 03:23:05.681]  Because hell, the average person is unconscious and half-dead anyways.
[03:23:05.681 --> 03:23:11.342]  So, beyond Roger Stone, beyond all this, I'm going to let you take over, and I appreciate you being here, Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:23:13.857 --> 03:23:19.920]  We just broke how they're laying everybody off because Obama's funding to do this.
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:28.063]  Obama funded, Obama funding, Obama had defense funding to attack Trump just ended.
[03:23:28.063 --> 03:23:32.645]  Obama's Defense Department anti-Trump funding just ended.
[03:23:32.645 --> 03:23:34.006]  And that's gotta be big news.
[03:23:34.006 --> 03:23:35.387]  But no one gives a damn!
[03:23:35.387 --> 03:23:36.927]  It's just here on our show.
[03:23:36.927 --> 03:23:37.568]  Who gives a hell?
[03:23:38.388 --> 03:23:40.209]  Meanwhile, Roger is about to be gagged.
[03:23:40.209 --> 03:23:42.371]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:23:42.371 --> 03:23:45.393]  So you take over for the rest of the hour from EarthPulse.com.
[03:23:45.393 --> 03:23:46.374]  We really appreciate you.
[03:23:46.374 --> 03:23:47.875]  Go ahead.
[03:23:47.875 --> 03:23:48.676]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:23:48.676 --> 03:23:51.098]  And you know, this is the root of it.
[03:23:51.098 --> 03:24:02.726]  You know, when you start thinking about information and the age we're in, the very control of information at the level in which it's manipulated today, you know, we talked about this decades ago.
[03:24:03.743 --> 03:24:08.687]  You know, I was thinking about this today as we went into this program, you know, and it really began with this guy.
[03:24:08.687 --> 03:24:12.229]  You know, you remember this guy's book, Between Two Ages.
[03:24:12.229 --> 03:24:23.438]  This is 49 years old, almost a half a century day, and it's the blueprint for the way in which the world has reformed around technology.
[03:24:23.438 --> 03:24:27.721]  The technocracy that exists today was predicted and ushered in
[03:24:28.221 --> 03:24:28.662]  I think?
[03:24:46.523 --> 03:25:00.841]  The socioeconomic breakdowns, the rise of technologies, the direction in which personal privacy would be shattered, and you know, going back even further, you know, back to the 50s and the predictions in things like 1984, right?
[03:25:00.841 --> 03:25:01.441]  I mean, it's worse.
[03:25:03.804 --> 03:25:06.086]  Than anything anyone ever imagined.
[03:25:06.086 --> 03:25:10.210]  And so Obama leaves sort of the advanced funding for the deep state.
[03:25:10.210 --> 03:25:24.984]  And I thought about, too, why are the social media and what I call the new age corporations, the new ones, the big mega trillion, kazillion corporations, the Apples, the Googles, the Facebooks, why are they attacking
[03:25:26.025 --> 03:25:26.926]  Donald Trump.
[03:25:26.926 --> 03:25:29.690]  Well, think about the Tax Reform Act that he just did.
[03:25:29.690 --> 03:25:35.176]  For corporations that are domiciled and make most of their money in America, it was a great deal, right?
[03:25:35.176 --> 03:25:39.402]  I mean, you lowered the tax rate to 20%, made them more competitive.
[03:25:39.402 --> 03:25:45.209]  They're making record profits as they file their taxes right now, you know, the next couple of months.
[03:25:45.749 --> 03:25:48.051]  And corporate taxes should do the 15th of March.
[03:25:48.051 --> 03:25:49.592]  So that's all being done right now.
[03:25:49.592 --> 03:25:51.393]  People are going, Yahoo!
[03:25:51.393 --> 03:26:03.543]  Except for the Googles and the Facebooks and the Apples, because they had their profit centers out of America, where Trump's tax law is now getting 15% of their foreign income.
[03:26:03.543 --> 03:26:04.643]  And that's the big market.
[03:26:04.643 --> 03:26:06.345]  We're $300 million in the U.S.
[03:26:06.345 --> 03:26:10.768]  as a market, and there's, you know, billions and billions, you know, to be served elsewhere.
[03:26:10.848 --> 03:26:11.468]  We're good to go.
[03:26:35.234 --> 03:26:35.454]  We're good.
[03:26:51.810 --> 03:27:02.417]  And so they're the ones now with the trillion dollar companies putting the screws to Donald Trump because he actually made them treated corporations like people, right?
[03:27:02.417 --> 03:27:02.777]  The U.S.
[03:27:02.777 --> 03:27:04.638]  Supreme Court gave them free speech.
[03:27:04.638 --> 03:27:10.122]  They can buy off elections now all over the country and influence our government even more.
[03:27:10.122 --> 03:27:13.724]  But hey, they don't want to pay the same deal on taxes.
[03:27:13.724 --> 03:27:19.308]  And when the Trump administration got that through the biggest tax reform act since Ronald Reagan,
[03:27:19.947 --> 03:27:24.670]  Hey, let's wait and see what the tax take is at the end of the year.
[03:27:24.670 --> 03:27:28.112]  Because people who really do work in America save some money.
[03:27:28.112 --> 03:27:31.875]  And when you get right down to it, maybe that's why the attack is on.
[03:27:31.875 --> 03:27:33.836]  In the other book I looked up recently,
[03:27:34.411 --> 03:27:35.771]  Before the show was this one.
[03:27:35.771 --> 03:27:37.492]  Many people remember this one.
[03:27:37.492 --> 03:27:38.872]  America, what went wrong?
[03:27:38.872 --> 03:27:42.073]  And this was the Philadelphia's Enquirer stuff.
[03:27:42.073 --> 03:27:46.714]  This was like the blueprint for Ross Perot's campaign in the early 90s.
[03:27:46.714 --> 03:27:48.114]  This was done in 92.
[03:27:48.114 --> 03:27:48.954]  27 years old.
[03:27:48.954 --> 03:27:55.896]  Now all the stuff that says in here about America, what went wrong, are all the same issues we have right now.
[03:27:55.896 --> 03:27:58.657]  27 years later.
[03:27:58.657 --> 03:27:59.437]  Still not change.
[03:27:59.437 --> 03:28:00.357]  In fact, worse.
[03:28:01.232 --> 03:28:02.613]  Worse.
[03:28:02.613 --> 03:28:17.405]  You know, when you look at it, the biggest reversal in the tax take to kind of equalize it is right now going on, you know, and it's going on with what Trump did in the tax reform that took place.
[03:28:17.405 --> 03:28:19.086]  Let's let that play out.
[03:28:19.086 --> 03:28:21.488]  You know, job numbers just came out today.
[03:28:21.488 --> 03:28:26.633]  The highest growth month in 100 months of job growth running in the U.S.
[03:28:26.633 --> 03:28:26.833]  of A.
[03:28:27.677 --> 03:28:32.621]  Hey, hurrah for Donald Trump and the administration that made it happen.
[03:28:32.621 --> 03:28:34.802]  And the momentum is just beginning.
[03:28:34.802 --> 03:28:36.263]  We're headed into the break.
[03:28:36.263 --> 03:28:39.726]  I see the clock ticking away.
[03:28:39.726 --> 03:28:45.050]  But there's a lot more going on in the propaganda wars of the 21st century.
[03:28:45.050 --> 03:28:47.652]  And when we get in the next section, we'll get more into that.
[03:28:47.652 --> 03:28:51.094]  This is Dr. Nick Begich on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:51.094 --> 03:28:52.095]  Shaking it up today.
[03:28:53.200 --> 03:28:56.782]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.782 --> 03:29:00.364]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.364 --> 03:29:02.485]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:33:30.882 --> 03:33:34.905]  You know, InfoWars is under attack.
[03:33:34.905 --> 03:33:38.166]  It's part of the propaganda wars that we're talking about today.
[03:33:38.166 --> 03:33:39.567]  The things that are really going on
[03:33:40.368 --> 03:33:42.410]  And you're the tip of the sword.
[03:33:42.410 --> 03:33:45.312]  I mean, you're the only reason we can even do this.

[03:34:15.393 --> 03:34:21.557]  A lot of people there doing good work and working hard to keep you informed.
[03:34:21.557 --> 03:34:22.977]  And really, you know, think about it again.
[03:34:22.977 --> 03:34:26.580]  InfoWars, you know, this was like where Alex began.
[03:34:27.260 --> 03:34:27.721]  Thank you.
[03:34:40.302 --> 03:34:45.385]  You know, my saying was, my slogan was, uh, changing the way we see the world.
[03:34:45.385 --> 03:34:45.785]  Okay?
[03:34:45.785 --> 03:34:49.667]  Because I looked at it as, hey, same concept.
[03:34:49.667 --> 03:34:58.271]  You know, we need to take another look at what we're seeing and kind of do our own interpretation because the one we were getting officially wasn't working.
[03:34:58.271 --> 03:35:02.133]  And three generations in government, my family in government,
[03:35:03.371 --> 03:35:06.574]  You know, I mean, the obvious was, you know, in our faces.
[03:35:06.574 --> 03:35:12.438]  And the difference is, you know, when you're, you know, Alex is going through a lot right now in terms of attack.
[03:35:12.438 --> 03:35:14.440]  You know, people are attacking him and it hurts.
[03:35:14.440 --> 03:35:15.221]  I mean, it hurts.
[03:35:15.221 --> 03:35:17.142]  You're not invincible.
[03:35:17.142 --> 03:35:22.566]  You know, when people start beating you up, it takes its toll.
[03:35:22.566 --> 03:35:30.293]  But at the same time, three generations of training, you know, you get what's called scar tissue for that.
[03:35:31.557 --> 03:35:42.405]  And you have to get beyond it because what's important is the information and keeping us on message and not responding to every single attack.
[03:35:42.405 --> 03:35:50.992]  But at some point this has got to go to the Supreme Court because what we're talking about here is silencing the very public debate
[03:35:51.838 --> 03:35:55.422]  That made America what it is today.
[03:35:55.422 --> 03:35:59.827]  And you can argue, because I hear these liberals arguing about whether it was ever great.
[03:35:59.827 --> 03:36:01.549]  I think it was always great.
[03:36:01.549 --> 03:36:07.616]  And because of the nature of the population, we've become better as a nation, I would say.
[03:36:07.616 --> 03:36:08.898]  You know, I mean, we did things.
[03:36:08.898 --> 03:36:12.302]  I mean, in 200 years, besides breaking free,
[03:36:12.922 --> 03:36:22.090]  You know, we got rid of things like indentured servitude, slavery, women's suffrage.
[03:36:22.090 --> 03:36:28.035]  You know, all these things happened around the world and in America in a really good way.
[03:36:28.035 --> 03:36:31.478]  And here we are several hundred years later, still a country, still together.
[03:36:31.978 --> 03:36:35.141]  But it was through discourse and sometimes really nasty.
[03:36:35.141 --> 03:36:40.547]  We don't want to go back there to the 1860s, for goodness sake.
[03:36:40.547 --> 03:36:44.490]  We've, I think, grown beyond that.
[03:36:44.490 --> 03:36:47.814]  But there's a lot to be debated in the way the country goes today.
[03:36:47.814 --> 03:36:51.177]  When you think about the blueprints, I had mentioned before the break,
[03:36:51.781 --> 03:36:58.009]  We were talking about Between Two Ages by Zbigniew Brzezinski, and we popped that cover up on the screen.
[03:36:58.009 --> 03:37:08.122]  And it's so timely, because here we are, 50 years, a half a century later, with his blueprint for the world, which it really was, because it's all happened.
[03:37:09.003 --> 03:37:18.727]  You could read it today like it was a history book, not realizing it was written 50 years ago, predictably accurate on what would happen with technology and the rise of it.
[03:37:18.727 --> 03:37:36.514]  And the use of technology to manipulate human behavior specifically, the ultimate propaganda tool, being able to enter the awareness of people and manipulate you through your data feeds to the information about you that's readily and easily available.
[03:37:36.514 --> 03:37:37.015]  And if you look
[03:37:38.579 --> 03:37:44.981]  At the work that we did identifying this going back now a couple of decades.
[03:37:44.981 --> 03:37:49.982]  Earth Rising, the revolution is carried by the InfoStorm.
[03:37:49.982 --> 03:37:54.223]  This book, written in 2000, was the blueprint for what's happening.
[03:37:54.223 --> 03:38:04.226]  Over 650 sources talking about privacy, talking about biometrics, voice recognition, all of the things that you read about today in the mainstream media.
[03:38:04.226 --> 03:38:05.747]  We reported on now 19 years ago.
[03:38:06.927 --> 03:38:12.950]  And document it with 650 footnotes that make the case for where this would go.
[03:38:12.950 --> 03:38:14.630]  Well, we're here now.
[03:38:14.630 --> 03:38:14.990]  Okay?
[03:38:14.990 --> 03:38:17.151]  The warning is over.
[03:38:17.151 --> 03:38:18.492]  We are here now.
[03:38:18.492 --> 03:38:21.913]  There's been many signaling this warning from every quarter.
[03:38:21.913 --> 03:38:23.734]  You know, Alex has been at it.
[03:38:23.734 --> 03:38:25.015]  We've been at it.
[03:38:25.015 --> 03:38:30.577]  Many, many people around the world have been at it in terms of breaking the alternative story.
[03:38:30.577 --> 03:38:32.858]  And this guy, you know, when you look at
[03:38:33.878 --> 03:38:41.083]  Bartlett and Steele at the Philadelphia Enquirer, when they put together that series of articles, it became the book, America, What Went Wrong.
[03:38:41.083 --> 03:38:49.909]  You know, what was powerful in that was it really laid out in plain language, sort of the blueprint for what happened and where we were today.
[03:38:49.909 --> 03:38:51.390]  I think we need another one of those.
[03:38:51.390 --> 03:38:53.171]  In fact, I've started drafting one.
[03:38:53.171 --> 03:38:57.714]  I'm going to put that book together here in the next few months, because I think it's important.
[03:38:57.714 --> 03:38:59.555]  You know, something simple and direct
[03:39:00.035 --> 03:39:11.681]  That says, here's the problem, here's a set of solutions that are real solutions that we could actually debate, maybe get somewhere on, and get that back out there, you know, approach it the same way.
[03:39:11.681 --> 03:39:24.268]  Have the information, graphically make it available, keep it simple so the message is clear on what we can do, and then let's have a fight over the solution, rather than just keep pointing out the problem, you know?
[03:39:24.268 --> 03:39:27.170]  And that's what we hear too much of, all the way around.
[03:39:28.300 --> 03:39:39.521]  I know one thing about this country, and I know one thing that made this country great from the very beginning, was there are a lot of very, very smart people.
[03:39:40.814 --> 03:39:44.335]  And there are a lot of very smart people in this listening audience.
[03:39:44.335 --> 03:39:55.179]  And every one of us has the power and capacity to create change in our neighborhoods, our communities, our families, with our circle of influence, whatever that is.
[03:39:55.179 --> 03:39:59.640]  Some people think theirs is small, and some people think theirs is really huge.
[03:39:59.640 --> 03:40:01.221]  But let me tell you something.
[03:40:01.221 --> 03:40:02.621]  It only takes one
[03:40:04.233 --> 03:40:10.400]  Message at the right moment to the right person and every one of us could be delivering that, not even realize it.
[03:40:10.400 --> 03:40:13.764]  In fact, I bet you we do every day.
[03:40:13.764 --> 03:40:22.755]  So as an encouraging word in this matrix of nonsense and propaganda, the Infowars know the power of one.
[03:40:23.856 --> 03:40:26.040]  That's what this country was based on.
[03:40:26.040 --> 03:40:29.585]  The sovereignty of the individual living soul.
[03:40:29.585 --> 03:40:31.428]  Not a squishy collective.
[03:40:31.428 --> 03:40:34.313]  But then out of that sovereignty came this great thing.
[03:40:34.313 --> 03:40:35.775]  This great thing.
[03:40:38.348 --> 03:40:49.233]  That we call the American experience, the experience we've had on this continent, quite different than what was happening and what is happening in Europe.
[03:40:49.233 --> 03:40:59.858]  My friend finally escaped from Germany, my business partner, finally escaped, I say escaped from Germany because his tax rate there as a living soul was 70%. 70%!
[03:41:05.225 --> 03:41:10.667]  You got to keep three cents, you know, out of every dime, you know, I mean, come on.
[03:41:10.667 --> 03:41:20.810]  But that's, you know, that he at least had the privilege and ability to leave because in Europe you can actually leave most of those places, go down the south somewhere else and pay the taxes in the place you live.
[03:41:20.810 --> 03:41:23.451]  You can't do that as an American.
[03:41:23.451 --> 03:41:24.751]  Many people don't realize this.
[03:41:24.751 --> 03:41:27.692]  You cannot leave the United States for tax reasons.
[03:41:28.493 --> 03:41:36.019]  And the reason you can't leave for tax reasons is because the State Department will not grant you permission.
[03:41:36.019 --> 03:41:42.904]  And most Americans don't realize that the State Department, to give up your citizenship, should you ever want to, you have to have permission.
[03:41:42.904 --> 03:41:44.866]  You just can't do it.
[03:41:44.866 --> 03:41:46.647]  You just can't say, oh, I don't want to do this anymore.
[03:41:46.647 --> 03:41:49.109]  No, you don't get the right to do that.
[03:41:49.109 --> 03:41:51.151]  You are chattel.
[03:41:54.813 --> 03:41:55.173]  I think so.
[03:42:14.992 --> 03:42:15.312]  I think?
[03:42:33.556 --> 03:42:41.825]  He needs to light it up and start issuing some subpoenas, getting some records, finding out what's going on, cracking the secrecy syndrome.
[03:42:41.825 --> 03:42:44.768]  Donald, we're relying on you, Mr. President.
[03:42:44.768 --> 03:42:46.950]  This is Nick Begich on the InfoWars.
[03:42:46.950 --> 03:42:49.813]  Time to end the propaganda and get the information.
[03:42:49.813 --> 03:42:50.494]  We're ready for it.
[03:42:55.922 --> 03:42:58.943]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:42:58.943 --> 03:43:05.385]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[03:43:53.261 --> 03:43:58.909]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:43:58.909 --> 03:44:02.234]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.

[03:44:53.934 --> 03:44:56.175]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:44:56.175 --> 03:44:57.916]  There is no set stasis.
[03:44:57.916 --> 03:44:59.157]  There is no managed system.
[03:44:59.157 --> 03:45:00.818]  There is no un-continuum.
[03:45:00.818 --> 03:45:04.040]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[03:45:04.040 --> 03:45:07.402]  So, you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[03:45:07.402 --> 03:45:08.643]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[03:45:08.643 --> 03:45:09.423]  We'll be here forever.
[03:45:09.423 --> 03:45:10.684]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:45:10.684 --> 03:45:18.128]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[03:45:18.128 --> 03:45:19.889]  And that's really where this goes.
[03:45:19.889 --> 03:45:22.111]  I tell you, God's got a big war for you ready.
[03:45:22.111 --> 03:45:22.491]  And so,
[03:45:22.691 --> 03:45:29.157]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[03:45:29.157 --> 03:45:34.201]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[03:45:34.201 --> 03:45:37.084]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:45:37.084 --> 03:45:39.466]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:45:39.466 --> 03:45:42.969]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[03:45:42.969 --> 03:45:43.990]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:45:44.230 --> 03:45:48.514]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[03:45:48.514 --> 03:45:51.396]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[03:45:51.396 --> 03:45:52.477]  I want life!
[03:45:52.477 --> 03:45:53.618]  I want Jesus!
[03:45:53.618 --> 03:45:55.419]  Listen, I'm just going to tell this for something right now.
[03:45:55.419 --> 03:46:01.284]  I think our best products are Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with a 95% curcuminoid level that no other company got.
[03:46:01.284 --> 03:46:02.004]  Nobody else did.
[03:46:02.004 --> 03:46:06.048]  Because everybody else, they put in a little bit of product and then they do a bunch of advertising and promote it.
[03:46:06.048 --> 03:46:07.229]  The turmeric in this is 95% curcuminoid.
[03:46:09.250 --> 03:46:11.971]  Nobody else has that bright yellow school bus color.
[03:46:11.971 --> 03:46:12.912]  That's what you're looking for.
[03:46:12.912 --> 03:46:13.512]  It's got it.

[03:46:56.744 --> 03:46:59.387]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:09.827 --> 03:47:16.249]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:16.249 --> 03:47:22.830]  And now your host, Nick Vagich.
[03:47:22.830 --> 03:47:25.731]  And welcome back to InfoWars.com.
[03:47:25.731 --> 03:47:33.193]  You know, again, I want to go back sort of again, you know, history always repeats itself.
[03:47:33.193 --> 03:47:37.354]  And I referenced a book so far in this program this Friday.
[03:47:38.892 --> 03:47:41.874]  That's 49 years old.
[03:47:41.874 --> 03:47:44.136]  Another one, 27 years old.
[03:47:44.136 --> 03:47:45.918]  The America What Went Wrong.
[03:47:45.918 --> 03:47:50.101]  And this one I'm going to reference now.
[03:47:50.101 --> 03:47:54.284]  This book is A New American History by W.E.
[03:47:54.284 --> 03:47:55.985]  Woodard that I'm holding up.
[03:47:55.985 --> 03:47:57.046]  This one's hard to find.
[03:47:57.046 --> 03:47:59.248]  This was 1936.
[03:47:59.248 --> 03:48:08.035]  And why it's important, it's like pre-World War II, pre-super industrial steroids, on steroids revolution in the United States.
[03:48:08.955 --> 03:48:19.421]  In this, you go back to the beginning of income tax as a concept and taxation and what the debates were in banking and what was happening and it was what were called the trusts.
[03:48:19.421 --> 03:48:30.488]  The Morgan Trust and others just referred to in those days as the trust included people like the Guggenheims and the Vanderbilts and the Morgans and all these wealthy families that had
[03:48:31.167 --> 03:48:42.772]  Basically figured out ways to carry black bags full of money into the Congress and bribe them and get huge amounts of public good transferred their way.
[03:48:42.772 --> 03:48:49.375]  In the case of the railroads, you know, one mile wide railroad easements all the way to the West Coast.
[03:48:49.375 --> 03:48:53.817]  And then they control all the grain elevators and everything that farmers needed.
[03:48:53.817 --> 03:48:57.399]  So they just broke the backs of these homesteaders that went out there.
[03:48:58.179 --> 03:48:59.000]  We're good to go.
[03:49:21.101 --> 03:49:21.741]  We're good to go.
[03:49:49.282 --> 03:49:52.848]  And my brother said, hey, if you don't have anything to hide, what's your problem, you know?
[03:49:52.848 --> 03:49:54.390]  And that was the end of the call.
[03:49:54.390 --> 03:49:56.433]  But they never did it, you know, and it still isn't done.
[03:49:56.433 --> 03:49:58.636]  That's something Donald Trump should have done.
[03:49:58.636 --> 03:49:59.978]  A full audit of the Federal Reserve.
[03:49:59.978 --> 03:50:00.579]  Where'd the money go?
[03:50:01.525 --> 03:50:03.186]  You know, where's the money?
[03:50:03.186 --> 03:50:04.206]  How much money was made?
[03:50:04.206 --> 03:50:05.167]  How is it distributed?
[03:50:05.167 --> 03:50:06.588]  What's the story?
[03:50:06.588 --> 03:50:07.788]  American public needs to know.
[03:50:07.788 --> 03:50:11.690]  This is our economy, not the Federal Reserve's, not 300 member bankers.
[03:50:11.690 --> 03:50:14.512]  A hundred years is too long to not be accountable.
[03:50:14.512 --> 03:50:23.517]  But when you look at the situation with the banking and the multinationals, the big guys of the day, it's the same equation repeating itself.
[03:50:23.517 --> 03:50:24.557]  This book, 72 years.
[03:50:26.833 --> 03:50:28.615]  And it's iterated.
[03:50:28.615 --> 03:50:41.168]  The guy who wrote it was in his 50s, 60s, interviewing people firsthand who remembered the Civil War, remembered the post-revolutionary period of the United States from the 1820s.
[03:50:41.168 --> 03:50:43.731]  He interviewed the guys when they were still breathing.
[03:50:43.731 --> 03:50:45.753]  That's why these older texts are so important.
[03:50:46.153 --> 03:50:48.155]  They're not sanitized, watered down.
[03:50:48.155 --> 03:50:56.384]  You want to talk about propaganda, look at the Texas book repository and the way in which textbooks are developed.
[03:50:56.384 --> 03:51:03.392]  You want to read propaganda, go read a modern history book for high school and then read this.
[03:51:04.477 --> 03:51:19.031]  This is the one you should teach your children, A New World History, 1936 as a starting point, because this is a really different way to see the world from the context of where people were living at the time.
[03:51:19.031 --> 03:51:27.439]  You know, when I look back at, again, when Ross Perot ran, you know, which is the same sentiment, people were sick and tired, you know, and then we got the watered-down nonsense.
[03:51:29.302 --> 03:51:36.910]  27 years from Ross Perot's run in the 90s to Trump all those years later.
[03:51:36.910 --> 03:51:45.358]  And when you think about Ross, he was a quirky character, really not fitting the normal mode, but he was successful business.
[03:51:45.358 --> 03:51:48.041]  He was way polite, you know, very polite man.
[03:51:48.041 --> 03:51:50.323]  And I appreciate that about Mr. Perot.
[03:51:52.549 --> 03:51:56.392]  But God, we need someone like that again, who's sharp.
[03:51:56.392 --> 03:51:59.594]  It would be nice to see Donald Trump carry through on the rest of it.
[03:51:59.594 --> 03:52:04.217]  You know, what happened when America What Went Wrong was published is it's just continued.
[03:52:04.924 --> 03:52:14.586]  The amount of the corporate take and the amount of the average guy and the decrease of the middle class, it's just gotten significantly worse in that 27 years.
[03:52:14.586 --> 03:52:20.828]  And when you look at some of this, again, simple solutions for this age, that's what's needed.
[03:52:20.828 --> 03:52:31.950]  Because right now, you know, Abraham Lincoln became a lawyer by just taking the bar exam because in those days, a little over 150 years ago, you could carry the law under one arm and a couple of all of you.
[03:52:32.671 --> 03:52:34.031]  And you could learn that.
[03:52:34.031 --> 03:52:37.753]  Today, it's a three-story library called the Law Library.
[03:52:37.753 --> 03:52:39.373]  Nobody can know that.
[03:52:39.373 --> 03:52:52.798]  How is a sovereign soul in America supposed to get justice when the regulations and laws that govern us are so complex that unless you have a Master's or a PhD, you're probably not going to be able to figure it out?
[03:52:54.810 --> 03:52:56.271]  That is not justice.
[03:52:56.271 --> 03:53:02.112]  You know, if you want to talk about socializing something, how about access to justice?
[03:53:02.112 --> 03:53:03.373]  You know, forget about medicine.
[03:53:03.373 --> 03:53:20.218]  It's not enshrined in the Constitution, but think about, and I don't mean that really to forget about medicine, but as a primary thing, how about equal access to the courts and justice and lawyers, where you don't have to give up everything you've ever worked for and everything you'll ever make to defend yourself?
[03:53:20.618 --> 03:53:31.667]  Why should Alex Jones, to defend his right to free speech, have to spend what's going to turn into millions by the time it gets to the US Supreme Court and this stuff gets unraveled?
[03:53:31.667 --> 03:53:38.552]  Why should an individual ever have to do that to get justice in America?
[03:53:38.552 --> 03:53:46.639]  Why should we have to fight so hard for the fundamentals of who we are, granted to us and enshrined in our Constitution?
[03:53:46.639 --> 03:53:48.020]  But if you're a corporation,
[03:53:49.039 --> 03:53:54.023]  You get a proportional measure of justice directly proportioned to the stack of money next to you.
[03:53:54.023 --> 03:53:57.185]  And that is not justice, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:53:57.185 --> 03:54:04.070]  That is not liberty, that is not freedom, and that is not a reflection of our founding fathers in the 21st century.
[03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:13.676]  We sit over two centuries of separation between the beginning and where we are today, and we have drifted too far the wrong direction.
[03:54:13.676 --> 03:54:16.798]  And the Googles and the Facebooks are now the tools
[03:54:18.470 --> 03:54:38.684]  The tools for a technocracy that couldn't do it on their own, because every time they got caught with things like programs like Total Awareness, where the Pentagon wanted to look at every aspect of your life, everything in your life, with the big data that was being developed way before it became public.
[03:54:38.684 --> 03:54:45.909]  Instead, they turned it over to the private sector, co-opted them and these very companies that enjoy the tax benefits of globalists.
[03:54:46.860 --> 03:54:57.829]  Who have picked your pocket and now picked your privacy and have locked you in to the gulag of the 21st century, which is a gulag of privacy.
[03:54:57.829 --> 03:55:09.418]  Where your information is taken from you, stripped from you, as if the Gestapo had just kicked in your doorway and took all of your files.
[03:55:09.418 --> 03:55:12.721]  Because more data about you exists in the public sector.
[03:55:13.499 --> 03:55:18.180]  Out there in the public domain, and then what government has collected.
[03:55:18.180 --> 03:55:38.886]  It'll blow your mind, and what it allows for is not just propaganda, but full-on manipulation of public opinion to the point that without stripping this down and changing it, this is going to end freedom and liberty as we know it in the 21st century.
[03:55:38.886 --> 03:55:40.887]  This generation must decide
[03:55:41.573 --> 03:55:54.142]  The listeners up to this program must decide whether we are going to be free or in a digital slavery, unlike anything we've ever experienced, because we're headed that direction.
[03:55:54.142 --> 03:55:55.563]  We can undo this.
[03:55:55.563 --> 03:56:05.550]  We can undo this by insisting that we own our data, that big companies no longer able to sell it or ask or even ask your permission.
[03:56:05.550 --> 03:56:11.134]  You should not be able to be asked, well, will you give up your rights today?
[03:56:11.906 --> 03:56:19.492]  No, you don't get the option, you don't get to just throw them away, you don't get to leave them at the doorstep of democracy in this republic.
[03:56:19.492 --> 03:56:20.533]  Nope!
[03:56:20.533 --> 03:56:24.876]  Can't happen, you can't ask, and you can't do it.
[03:56:24.876 --> 03:56:33.883]  Because this is so much fundamental to who we are as sovereign human beings, this strips us of our human dignity on every level.
[03:56:33.883 --> 03:56:34.163]  Nope!
[03:56:34.995 --> 03:56:35.917]  Not allowed.
[03:56:35.917 --> 03:56:39.203]  You cannot kick in our digital doorways anymore.
[03:56:39.203 --> 03:56:41.207]  This is what needs to change.
[03:56:41.207 --> 03:56:43.091]  We need to strip out.
[03:56:43.803 --> 03:57:09.988]  Of these mega corporations that use the very information that we are to compile profiles just like in China for a social score that then is fed back to us in propaganda on steroids by those selling us soap or those selling us crummy ideas and crummy concepts that we don't get to debate in the full light of day.
[03:57:09.988 --> 03:57:12.488]  It's in the open debate that things change.
[03:57:12.908 --> 03:57:14.929]  We can turn off the station.
[03:57:14.929 --> 03:57:16.870]  We can change the channel.
[03:57:16.870 --> 03:57:18.130]  That's our prerogative.
[03:57:18.130 --> 03:57:23.993]  But we should never silence the voice of our opposition, no matter who they are.
[03:57:23.993 --> 03:57:25.674]  This is the InfoWars.
[03:57:25.674 --> 03:57:28.595]  This is the InfoWars of the 21st century.
