[00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:09.255]  President Trump is being spied on by the permanent deep state that has presided over the sellout of this nation in the last 50 years.
[00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:16.057]  All of the trade deals have been one-sided to de-industrialize this nation and bring us to our knees.
[00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:18.158]  David Rockefeller bragged about that.
[00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:25.200]  He wrote articles in the New York Times praising Mao Zedong and saying someday China would defeat America.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.321]  That's what the CFR openly preaches.
[00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:47.931]  These people are America haters, but now Attorney General Barr has criminal probes going of Robert Mueller, of McCabe, of Comey, of Hillary, and Fox News is reporting Barr asked Trump to reach out to other countries for Durham probe.
[00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:52.973]  Official says source pushes back on New York Times reporting.
[00:00:54.127 --> 00:00:56.870]  Wasn't Trump calling up pressuring foreign leaders?
[00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.953]  He barely even mentioned Joe Biden's son.
[00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:04.037]  And just said, Joe Biden's been on the news bragging he made this prosecutor resign.
[00:01:04.357 --> 00:01:05.839]  Gosh, that's crazy arrogance.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.345]  He said it at the CFR, pissing in America's face.
[00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:12.926]  I said, we're leaving in six hours.
[00:01:13.447 --> 00:01:15.809]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.371]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:23.571]  But shouldn't the president be trying to expose corruption?
[00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:25.212]  He's the executive branch.
[00:01:25.232 --> 00:01:26.073]  He's doing his job.
[00:01:26.493 --> 00:01:33.237]  The idea that he can't fight any corruption, the Democratic Party, because it's an election year is absurd.
[00:01:33.518 --> 00:01:40.042]  They're trying to impeach President Trump going into an election year for fighting their corruption.
[00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:41.143]  It's hidden in plain view.
[00:01:41.803 --> 00:01:45.105]  But now they're saying, oh, he talked to the Australian leader.
[00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:48.207]  Oh, he asked about this, he asked about that.
[00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:59.455]  The truth is, the Bushes, the Clintons, the Obamas, the Bushes, all these people have been getting away with murder, selling this country out.
[00:02:00.216 --> 00:02:02.417]  And they thought it always would be them in power.
[00:02:02.457 --> 00:02:03.958]  So they were very ruthless about it.
[00:02:04.198 --> 00:02:05.519]  They were very arrogant about it.
[00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:06.660]  They were very public about it.
[00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:13.029]  Hillary brags about going and wrecking Libya and hundreds of thousands dying.
[00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.314]  Madeleine Albright, who worked for the Clintons, bragged about a half million kids starving to death when the Clintons tripled sanctions on Iraq.
[00:02:19.374 --> 00:02:22.437]  I mean, these people are monsters that hate this country.
[00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:26.960]  But now they're going to guard the country because Trump's going after their corruption.
[00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:33.706]  I've got to tell you, I've been upset with Trump not fighting censorship and not exposing the dangers of vaccines like he promised.
[00:02:34.526 --> 00:02:45.069]  Since I read these transcripts and I see the hard work he's doing and how he's going up against these criminals that make the mafia look like choir boys, I'm really proud of President Trump.
[00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.409]  This is a big deal.
[00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:51.270]  And they wanted us censored off the air ahead of this attempted takeover.
[00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:59.772]  But we're still on air at Band.Video and Infowars.com forward slash show and on radio stations and TV stations across this country, thanks to your support.
[00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:03.973]  So please understand we're going to be here, Lord willing, because of your prayers and support.
[00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:15.946]  Throughout all of this as it unfolds, but history's happening now, and your action, your word of mouth, is what is going to defeat these people.
[00:03:16.106 --> 00:03:17.666]  America is hanging in the balance.
[00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:22.528]  Some really bad people thought we were done, but we showed them in the last minute that we're going to fight back.
[00:03:22.888 --> 00:03:24.149]  Now let's defeat them.
[00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:32.171]  Let's not let them impeach Trump, and let's make sure his criminal investigations of them are followed through on, which we now know is happening.
[00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:33.752]  That's why the globalists are so scared.
[00:03:34.517 --> 00:03:36.899]  Your word of mouth, your prayers are central to all of this.
[00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.360]  And we're right there with President Trump, so we're under attack.
