[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:04.853]  Gavin McInnes is back with his all-new online network, Freespeech.tv.
[00:00:04.853 --> 00:00:10.877]  Gavin McInnes, Joe Biggs, Miley Yiannopoulos, and Soph, all at Freespeech.tv.
[00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:14.480]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.354 --> 00:00:41.484]  And we are live on this October 22nd, 2019 edition with me, your host, Paul Joseph Watson, filling in for Alex Jones for the first two hours.
[00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:47.570]  In the second hour, we're going to talk to Laura Loomer, who has made the comeback of all comebacks, basically.
[00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.136]  Banned off of every social media platform, banned off of numerous other company platforms.
[00:00:53.849 --> 00:01:02.632]  She's outraised the Democratic incumbent there in South Florida and she's outraised the combined total of the GOP candidates.
[00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:12.875]  All of them put together from zero platform whatsoever, from all media, social media platforms because of course she's been banned on everything else.
[00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:18.597]  So we're going to talk to her in the second hour about her campaign, what she foresees, how she can win that campaign.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.341]  It's a very democratically held seat.
[00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:24.502]  It's a very tight seat there in Florida.
[00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:27.983]  I think they voted for Hillary over Trump 69%.
[00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:33.984]  So it's going to be an uphill task, but she has outraised the Democratic incumbent.
[00:01:33.984 --> 00:01:37.245]  So we're going to talk to her about her plans to win that race.
[00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:46.148]  Meanwhile, I'm looking at the Drudge Report and his top headline, Dem Halloween, Hillary leaves door open.
[00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:48.589]  Yes, the witch is back.
[00:01:49.272 --> 00:01:58.896]  And this is a story which is also replicated basically it's the same story up on summit.news which is Hillary laughs with delight after audience member suggests she run for president.
[00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:08.189]  Now, we've had several indications over the last few weeks that yes, indeed, Hillary is aiming for a third failed presidential run.
[00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:14.133]  Of course, former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon thinks that that's exactly what she's waiting for.
[00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.555]  She's primed to get in at the right moment.
[00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:20.218]  Whether that moment is imminent remains to be seen.
[00:02:20.218 --> 00:02:27.063]  But of course, she also appeared on Stephen Colbert's show a few weeks ago and refused to endorse any of the Democratic candidates.
[00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:28.164]  She was asked again
[00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:42.309]  During this event in Portland, Oregon, who she was going to endorse, she was up on a panel with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, and basically somebody in the audience, she said, we have a list of candidates, we have to nominate the best.
[00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:47.253]  As soon as Hillary said that, somebody in the audience shouted out, you.
[00:02:47.253 --> 00:02:52.437]  Hillary reacted with a big smile and a laugh before saying, oh my, well, thank you.
[00:02:52.437 --> 00:02:54.959]  And again, it's up on top of the Drudge Report right now.
[00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.180]  Of course, we had predicted
[00:02:57.173 --> 00:03:08.039]  The big political website for predicting future presidential candidates, future democratic candidates, suggesting that she was the third favourite and that was about two weeks ago.
[00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.799]  She's slipped down since.
[00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.222]  But again, more indications that Hillary Clinton might be preparing to run.
[00:03:15.222 --> 00:03:16.623]  Of course, the meme makers are
[00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:25.467]  Licking their chops at the prospect of that is going to be very exciting indeed if she does in fact take on a third failed presidential candidacy.
[00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:29.672]  But it ties in with this headline which was also linked up on the Drudge Report earlier.
[00:03:29.672 --> 00:03:34.376]  Anxious democratic establishment asks, is there anybody else?
[00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:40.102]  The candidates, the paucity of candidates, the paucity of quality candidates is so self-evident.
[00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:51.387]  But this article asks, when half a dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked.
[00:03:51.387 --> 00:04:00.889]  But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race, but who could be lured in.
[00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.930]  So they're not satisfied with whoever they've got up there at the moment.
[00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:16.068]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton continues to bash Tulsi Gabbard, and in fact she cancelled a planned appearance at a speaking event where Tulsi Gabbard would be attending.
[00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:27.910]  So we're going to get into that because Trump himself, of course, yesterday came out and branded Hillary's Russia asset conspiracy theory, which she leveled at Tulsi Gabbard, quote, sick.
[00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.831]  We're going to get into that.
[00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:30.571]  We're going to get into the New York Times saying
[00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:44.914]  From before that the Deep State didn't exist and that anyone who talked about a Deep State was a racist right-wing conspiracy theorist, now they say it's here, it's real, and it's here to rescue the Republic from President Trump.
[00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:54.097]  So before you were a dangerous conspiracy theorist for even mentioning the term Deep State, now the New York Times says it's real and it's good.
[00:04:54.097 --> 00:05:04.380]  Just like they said back in the day that global government didn't exist and it became so obvious that that was the agenda they had to admit it was real but that it was a benign positive force.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.700]  We'll be back in the next segment.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.741]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:08.261]  Don't go away.
[00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.471]  Hello today on All Things Considered.
[00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:13.332]  I'm Wilbur Snakely.
[00:05:13.332 --> 00:05:20.995]  Here to tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[00:05:20.995 --> 00:05:31.079]  Now sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that it's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:31.979]  That's right.
[00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.180]  Drink the fluoride.
[00:05:33.857 --> 00:05:40.381]  Don't visit Infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen, I mean the bad halogen, iodine.
[00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:43.903]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[00:05:43.903 --> 00:05:50.327]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us.
[00:05:50.327 --> 00:05:52.008]  We don't want to compete with you.
[00:05:52.008 --> 00:05:54.670]  Just drink the fluoride.
[00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.911]  Don't learn about
[00:05:56.491 --> 00:06:00.574]  How deadly it is, and whatever you do, don't support Alex Jones.
[00:06:00.574 --> 00:06:05.017]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm liberal.
[00:06:05.017 --> 00:06:07.719]  Oh, and let Nambla have access to your children, huh?
[00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:25.234]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:25.234 --> 00:06:26.937]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:26.937 --> 00:06:28.599]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:33.306]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.555 --> 00:06:44.821]  So the effort to topple a democratically elected president, which has been an effort that's been ongoing for three years plus now, continues apace.
[00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.822]  The impeachment bandwagon rolls on.
[00:06:46.822 --> 00:06:50.944]  Of course, the Democrats have just 47 seats in the Senate.
[00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:54.046]  They need 67 votes to convict Trump.
[00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:58.529]  But according to a strategist, a GOP strategist called Mike Murphy,
[00:06:59.412 --> 00:07:06.396]  He says there may be 30 Senate Republicans who would vote to convict Trump if the vote was held in secret.
[00:07:06.396 --> 00:07:10.038]  How many of those can be turned around to do so publicly?
[00:07:10.038 --> 00:07:25.906]  And at the same time, we have Hillary Clinton once again making every indication that she's going to make her venture into the Democratic field at this relatively late stage, given that most, or at least numerous, debates have already happened.
[00:07:27.094 --> 00:07:29.016]  It's up on the Drudge Report as a top headline.
[00:07:29.016 --> 00:07:30.397]  It's also at summit.news.
[00:07:30.397 --> 00:07:34.680]  Hillary laughs with delight after audience members suggest she run for president.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:45.067]  She was doing a forum event with her daughter and said, we have to nominate, cough, of course she's coughing already, get ready for that again, the best.
[00:07:45.067 --> 00:07:53.534]  And then somebody in the audience shouted out, you, as Hillary was about to say the word candidate.
[00:07:53.534 --> 00:07:56.256]  And again, she appeared earlier this month on PBS NewsHour
[00:07:57.313 --> 00:08:03.537]  Taunting Trump saying obviously I can beat him again because yeah she beat him the first time didn't she?
[00:08:03.537 --> 00:08:08.821]  She also failed to beat Barack Obama or even run against him in 2008 of course.
[00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:17.727]  She also fanned the flames of speculation when she tweeted at Trump a week ago quote don't tempt me so again all indications suggest that Hillary
[00:08:18.703 --> 00:08:32.850]  Probably the most arrogant politician in American history, still completely oblivious to the degree with which she's absolutely hated by huge numbers of Americans, still might throw her hat into the ring.
[00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:38.773]  Because as I pointed out with this article before, anxious Democratic establishment asked, is there anybody else?
[00:08:38.773 --> 00:08:46.976]  They had a meeting with a bunch of donors at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan, and they asked, would Hillary Clinton get in?
[00:08:46.976 --> 00:08:48.137]  The contributors wondered.
[00:08:48.897 --> 00:08:50.277]  How about Michael Bloomberg?
[00:08:50.277 --> 00:08:52.618]  How about Michelle Obama?
[00:08:52.618 --> 00:08:55.398]  Would she consider entering at this late stage?
[00:08:55.398 --> 00:09:03.960]  Of course, her approval ratings are far better than Hillary Clinton's, but she's said over and over again that she's not going to get involved.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:04.860]  This is a quote.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:14.282]  Since the last debate, just anecdotally, I've had five or six people ask me, is there anybody else said Leah Doherty, a longtime Democrat who has run two of the party's recent conventions,
[00:09:15.234 --> 00:09:22.917]  So they're not satisfied with anyone who's running and Hillary Clinton could be about to step into that vacuum.
[00:09:22.917 --> 00:09:35.302]  But she's still getting a lot of bad press, a lot of heat for her treatment of Tulsi Gabbard, who of course is probably the only authentic politician within that entire democratic field.
[00:09:35.302 --> 00:09:38.504]  We had this article up yesterday on summit.news.
[00:09:38.504 --> 00:09:41.745]  Hillary Clinton cancels appearance at event where Tulsi Gabbard is speaking.
[00:09:43.146 --> 00:09:47.347]  This is a 2019 Fortune Most Powerful Women's Summit.
[00:09:47.347 --> 00:09:54.729]  She claimed she had, quote, a scheduling conflict that would prevent her from attending this forum.
[00:09:54.729 --> 00:10:00.310]  But of course, this was announced after it was revealed that Tulsi Gabbard would be attending.
[00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:08.992]  A source close to Clinton told Slate that Hillary dropped out because Kirsten Nielsen, the former Secretary of Homeland Security, is also scheduled to speak at the event.
[00:10:10.074 --> 00:10:16.377]  However, some speculate the real reason Hillary got cold feet is because Tulsi Gabbard will be attending.
[00:10:16.377 --> 00:10:24.762]  Of course, she claimed that Russia was grooming Tulsi Gabbard to be a spoiler to help President Trump, with absolutely no evidence whatsoever.
[00:10:24.762 --> 00:10:27.543]  Everybody I don't like is a Russian asset.
[00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:29.784]  We've had that narrative for three and a half years.
[00:10:29.784 --> 00:10:36.808]  No matter how many times it gets debunked and discredited, that is their go-to excuse for everything under the sun.
[00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:39.423]  This is a quote.
[00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:45.005]  I think they've got their eye on somebody who's currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third party candidate.
[00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:47.286]  That's what Clinton said about Tulsi Gabbard.
[00:10:47.286 --> 00:10:49.947]  She's the favourite of the Russians.
[00:10:49.947 --> 00:10:52.068]  Gabbard hit back.
[00:10:52.068 --> 00:11:06.153]  And we played that video, that viral video of her hitting back at Hillary Clinton, saying that Clinton represented the queen of warmongers, the embodiment of corruption, the personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.
[00:11:06.747 --> 00:11:16.053]  And if you look at her social media metrics over the past five days or so since that confrontation with Clinton, Tulsi Gabbard is going through the roof.
[00:11:16.053 --> 00:11:24.739]  Tends to be the fact that if you go up against Clinton, who is universally hated by a lot of people, it makes you look quite good.
[00:11:24.739 --> 00:11:28.561]  So Tulsi Gabbard is definitely playing off of that.
[00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:31.123]  And in fact, Donald Trump himself
[00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:39.658]  Spoke out in defense of Tulsi Gabbard during his cabinet meeting yesterday and we have that clip right now.
[00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:43.142]  Trump brands Hillary and Russia conspiracy theorists as sick.
[00:11:43.142 --> 00:11:45.065]  Let's go ahead and play President Trump.
[00:11:45.908 --> 00:11:52.132]  Hillary Clinton, if you've heard of her, she's the one that's accusing everybody of being a Russian agent.
[00:11:52.132 --> 00:11:54.994]  Anybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent.
[00:11:54.994 --> 00:11:59.398]  So that's a scam that was pretty much put down.
[00:11:59.398 --> 00:12:02.760]  Tulsi, I don't know Tulsi, but she's not a Russian agent.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.201]  I don't know Jill Stein.
[00:12:04.201 --> 00:12:06.202]  I know she likes environment.
[00:12:06.202 --> 00:12:08.624]  I don't think she likes Russians.
[00:12:08.624 --> 00:12:10.946]  If she does like them, I know she's not an asset.
[00:12:10.946 --> 00:12:12.407]  She called her an asset of Russia.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.341]  These people are sick.
[00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:17.083]  There's something wrong with them.
[00:12:17.083 --> 00:12:23.709]  But I think that Tulsi Gabbard probably got helped quite a bit by this.
[00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:27.492]  I think we were helped because it shows for two and a half years, we end up winning.
[00:12:27.492 --> 00:12:29.234]  I had to go through two and a half years.
[00:12:29.234 --> 00:12:32.757]  If she would have done this earlier, people would have realized what a scam it is.
[00:12:32.757 --> 00:12:36.081]  Everybody's a Russian or a Russian agent or a Russian asset.
[00:12:37.918 --> 00:12:38.518]  So there you have it.
[00:12:38.518 --> 00:12:41.000]  Of course, Trump mentioned Jill Stein there.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.881]  And that is the fear.
[00:12:41.881 --> 00:12:50.467]  If Tulsi Gabbard runs as a third-party candidate, she could take away, you know, 4, 5, 6 percent of the vote from the Democratic candidate.
[00:12:50.467 --> 00:12:56.892]  And she may indeed run as a third-party candidate, given that she's the only authentic candidate in the field of Democrats thus far.
[00:12:56.892 --> 00:13:01.095]  Maybe you could make the argument for Andrew Yang, but that is a potential spoiler.
[00:13:01.095 --> 00:13:03.256]  Does it mean that Russia is behind it?
[00:13:03.256 --> 00:13:06.859]  No, that's completely ridiculous, the same way they said it about Jill Stein.
[00:13:07.831 --> 00:13:09.592]  No evidence to back it up whatsoever.
[00:13:09.592 --> 00:13:18.516]  Talking about no evidence, the New York Times, for basically the past three and a half years, has said there's no evidence that a deep state even exists.
[00:13:18.516 --> 00:13:23.139]  Well now they say it does exist, but it's a good thing.
[00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:32.003]  Headline on Infowars.com, New York Times shifts from the deep state doesn't exist to it's real and it's here to rescue the Republic from Trump.
[00:13:32.003 --> 00:13:33.864]  Yes, you can trust them.
[00:13:33.864 --> 00:13:37.286]  You can trust them now, even though we said they didn't exist for three and a half years.
[00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:48.852]  The New York Times has gone from insisting the Deep State doesn't exist to admitting it's real, but insisting it's totally awesome and here to rescue the Republic from Dronald Blumph.
[00:13:48.852 --> 00:13:53.133]  The Deep State is alive and well composed of patriotic public servants.
[00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:57.835]  This is a New York Times opinion, and that's how they pass it off.
[00:13:57.835 --> 00:14:04.097]  Often they put opinion pieces as actual news, so the line between those two has been completely blurred anyway.
[00:14:04.097 --> 00:14:04.837]  But this is a tweet.
[00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.252]  Put out by an official New York Times account.
[00:14:08.252 --> 00:14:11.154]  Their aim is not to bring down President Trump.
[00:14:11.154 --> 00:14:18.879]  Oh no, that's not what they've been doing relentlessly for the past three and a half years at every possible turn.
[00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:25.324]  But it's out of personal and political animus, but to rescue the Republic from his excesses.
[00:14:25.324 --> 00:14:31.248]  Michelle Collette writes in the New York Times, they are not the resistance, they are not a cabal, they are public servants.
[00:14:31.248 --> 00:14:33.810]  Let us now praise these not silent heroes.
[00:14:34.731 --> 00:14:35.699]  And that goes on and on.
[00:14:35.699 --> 00:14:37.352]  You can go and read the New York Times article.
[00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:56.959]  Chris Menehan comments, unselected, unelected intelligence agents like the phony CIA whistleblower are here to rescue us through an administrative coup to ensure President Trump cannot follow through on the campaign promises he was democratically elected on such as pulling out the Middle East or making peace with Russia.
[00:14:56.959 --> 00:15:01.021]  So now the Deep State exists, it's good, it's going to tear down Trump.
[00:15:01.021 --> 00:15:04.743]  Externalisation of the method, if you please,
[00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:10.912]  Meanwhile, racist watch website outs Trump donors goes offline.
[00:15:10.912 --> 00:15:12.993]  This is out Zero Hedge.
[00:15:12.993 --> 00:15:17.214]  Apparently it's not enough for the leftists to spit on supporters of President Donald Trump.
[00:15:17.214 --> 00:15:19.575]  Of course, he played that video last week.
[00:15:19.575 --> 00:15:27.739]  For an apparent activist group called Public Service Media Group, outing Trump donors across America is what really makes the difference.
[00:15:27.739 --> 00:15:33.901]  It's triggered leftist panic that all they have is hashtag not Trump as they head into the 2020 election campaign.
[00:15:34.807 --> 00:15:57.840]  So with all this partisan bickering, with all this tension, with all this call from people like Maxine Waters and others within the Democratic establishment to go out and confront Trump supporters, members of Trump's cabinet, and of course not only shout them down, get in their face, in some cases violently attack them, as we've seen on multiple occasions, especially with anyone daring to wear a MAGA hat,
[00:15:58.401 --> 00:16:02.749]  Now they're outing where these Trump donors live in New York.
[00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:05.454]  What do you think is going to happen next?
[00:16:05.454 --> 00:16:06.376]  We'll be back.
[00:16:06.376 --> 00:16:06.937]  Don't go away.
[00:16:08.365 --> 00:16:19.551]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:28.876]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[00:16:28.876 --> 00:16:33.939]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:38.361]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location.
[00:16:38.361 --> 00:16:46.325]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood water's backstory.
[00:16:46.325 --> 00:16:47.586]  So here's what you should do right now.
[00:16:47.586 --> 00:16:49.587]  Check out the PPX Microgrid system

[00:16:58.238 --> 00:16:58.919]  And the best part?
[00:16:58.919 --> 00:17:00.040]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500, $300 or even $200.

[00:17:08.138 --> 00:17:10.098]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:17:10.098 --> 00:17:15.400]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.980]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:25.342]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:17:25.342 --> 00:17:31.023]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:17:31.203 --> 00:17:33.044]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:17:33.044 --> 00:17:35.205]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:17:35.205 --> 00:17:39.688]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:17:39.688 --> 00:17:41.889]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:17:41.889 --> 00:17:49.733]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:18:09.116 --> 00:18:18.618]  Look, I'm not trying to discourage other best-selling bone broth formulas that sell for 35, 40, 50, 60 bucks retail and are discounted for like $39.95.
[00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:24.721]  But they don't have as much pure concentrated bone broth as we do.
[00:18:24.721 --> 00:18:26.602]  They don't have as much chocolate mushroom.
[00:18:26.602 --> 00:18:28.623]  They don't have as much bee pollen.
[00:18:28.623 --> 00:18:32.365]  They don't have as much of these amazing ingredients.
[00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:37.127]  And yes, we've gone out and just made a stronger version of other bestsellers.
[00:18:37.127 --> 00:18:37.828]  And it's selling out.
[00:18:38.408 --> 00:18:46.158]  Unlock the ancient power of bone broth in Ultimate Bone Broth for 50% off at infowrestore.com for a limited time.

[00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.871]  InfoWars presents
[00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:12.751]  Alex Jones.
[00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:28.030]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious, came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies die in the womb, and it causes cancer.
[00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.653]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[00:19:31.093 --> 00:19:37.956]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[00:19:37.956 --> 00:19:46.579]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children.
[00:19:46.579 --> 00:19:52.402]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:53.542 --> 00:19:56.184]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:26.633 --> 00:20:49.728]  I think it's vital to understand the stakes and why the deep state that's hijacked this nation is so panicked right now because they see their power and their control slipping away.
[00:20:49.728 --> 00:20:54.111]  Because if you control the United States, you control the world.
[00:20:55.819 --> 00:21:04.846]  If Trump is impeached and convicted in the Senate, his first term appointments to the Supreme Court of the United States will be assailed.
[00:21:04.846 --> 00:21:11.691]  Getting rid of Trump means they will impeach Kavanaugh next, which they've already been promoting and getting ready.
[00:21:11.691 --> 00:21:16.855]  And they will try to nullify all federal judges, hundreds of them, that he's put in.
[00:21:16.855 --> 00:21:21.358]  This is way bigger than one man, as my friend Mike Adams points out.
[00:21:23.058 --> 00:21:26.523]  It's time, ladies and gentlemen, to wake up.
[00:21:26.523 --> 00:21:37.380]  It's time to realize this is literally the future of humanity we're talking about because the globalists are technocrats who want a post-human world.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.902]  They've thrown down the gauntlet.
[00:21:40.003 --> 00:21:49.590]  GOP be warned, impeachment will set off democratic push to reverse Trump's Supreme Court appointments, tax cuts, and regulatory reforms.
[00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.832]  Again, Mike Adamson, NaturalNews.com has written an excellent article.
[00:21:52.832 --> 00:21:57.616]  I suggest you share it from there or NewsWars.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:58.797]  But whatever you do,
[00:22:00.026 --> 00:22:04.811]  Whether you're watching a live feed, or whether you see this posted as a video report later, share it!
[00:22:04.811 --> 00:22:09.836]  It's that human action, the globalist dread, and hey, they want you to feel powerless.
[00:22:09.836 --> 00:22:11.598]  You are not powerless.
[00:22:11.598 --> 00:22:13.860]  You have incredible power.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:19.566]  Remember the stakes, and remember that your financial support of InfoWars is paramount.
[00:22:19.566 --> 00:22:21.187]  We're running a super sale right now.

[00:22:52.587 --> 00:22:57.151]  I've got more special reports as well, and I'll be back in the office later this afternoon.
[00:22:57.151 --> 00:22:57.772]  Please take action.
[00:23:02.535 --> 00:23:05.778]  That was Alex Jones talking about the impeachment bandwagon.
[00:23:05.778 --> 00:23:11.624]  Of course, there's also a great article which everyone should read up on InfoWars.com right now by Michael Snyder.
[00:23:11.624 --> 00:23:17.029]  If Donald Trump is impeached, that will be a sign that all hell is about to break loose in America.
[00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:22.594]  We've had warnings of civil war, warnings of riots, warnings of civil unrest.
[00:23:22.594 --> 00:23:24.636]  Of course, we had that after Trump was elected.
[00:23:24.636 --> 00:23:27.479]  We had Hillary Clinton supporters rioting in the streets.
[00:23:28.214 --> 00:23:35.760]  They're probably going to do so again if Trump wins re-election, which the polls suggest he will if we have an average or a low turnout.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.464]  But also, what will the reaction be of Trump supporters if indeed Trump is impeached?
[00:23:40.464 --> 00:23:46.169]  We're going to go back to Alex Jones now, talking about the leftist, socialist, globalist conspiracy.
[00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:47.891]  Here is Alex Jones once again.
[00:23:49.522 --> 00:23:55.066]  What do socialism, communism, and globalism all have in common?
[00:23:55.066 --> 00:24:05.213]  They're all command and control, centralized systems that have a Politburo, or a group of bureaucrats, technocrats that run them.
[00:24:05.213 --> 00:24:12.198]  And if you study the top Fortune 100 companies, the big banks, to a company, they finance
[00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:18.302]  The move towards centralization and towards world government.
[00:24:18.302 --> 00:24:29.386]  So when President Trump gets up there and says, socialism, communism and globalism are our enemies, he is singling out the true enemy of humanity.
[00:24:29.386 --> 00:24:33.287]  And that's why the system is so incredibly scared.
[00:24:33.287 --> 00:24:37.269]  The 20th century industrialized and computerized everything.
[00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:41.130]  And humanity really got sucker punched by these guys with all the Hollywood propaganda.
[00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:58.091]  But 19 years into the 21st century, humanity is coming back from the dead and really realizing what's happening and understanding how these big multinational corporations aren't liberal, they're fascistic, they're authoritarian, but they package themselves as liberal and loving.
[00:24:58.091 --> 00:25:00.233]  The truth is they're trying to create a planet
[00:25:00.874 --> 00:25:02.395]  That's post-human.
[00:25:02.395 --> 00:25:08.257]  Where normal natural human activity has been basically outlawed, and everything is artificiality.
[00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:14.599]  Where you've got to get government and corporate approval to even have a child, because we've been so poisoned it's impossible to have a child.
[00:25:14.599 --> 00:25:17.120]  That's their final revolution.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.481]  Ending what we are as a species forever.
[00:25:19.481 --> 00:25:22.402]  That's what the Carnegie Endowment was tasked to do at the end of World War II.
[00:25:22.402 --> 00:25:24.022]  And that's their plan.
[00:25:24.022 --> 00:25:26.663]  And that's why they're so upset at President Trump.
[00:25:26.663 --> 00:25:28.224]  That's why they're so upset at Infowars.
[00:25:29.392 --> 00:25:42.141]  Infowars is credited by the leftist-run CIA, and by the Ford Foundation, and by Media Matters, and by all these different globalist organs, as launching Trump, and as writing the talking points for the global resistance.
[00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:43.322]  But we really didn't do that.
[00:25:43.322 --> 00:25:57.312]  We simply studied the white papers of the Chi-Coms, and the EU, and the Council on Foreign Relations, and the transhumanist movements, and understood what their real sneak attack revolution against humanity was, and decided to say,
[00:25:58.072 --> 00:26:04.059]  I bet folks will want to hear about this, especially as it begins to actually manifest and emerge.
[00:26:04.059 --> 00:26:06.663]  And I bet people will resist it.
[00:26:06.663 --> 00:26:07.844]  And you know what?
[00:26:07.844 --> 00:26:12.570]  My basic understanding of reality and history turned out to be damn right.
[00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:20.094]  And so I want the enemy to know, I didn't bring this resistance, I simply helped point it out, and I bet on humanity.
[00:26:20.094 --> 00:26:21.975]  Something you haven't been doing.
[00:26:21.975 --> 00:26:30.659]  So if you want to stand with humanity, and stand with InfoWars, and stand with President Trump, spread the word about this live broadcast, spread the word about the articles, and buy some products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:26:30.659 --> 00:26:32.921]  Because without you supporting us, the enemy will win.
[00:26:32.921 --> 00:26:38.844]  You take action, we are going to kick some major globalist ass into the future, and have a pro-human future.
[00:26:39.304 --> 00:26:52.138]  We're fighting a campaign against leftists, socialists, and globalists who want to return to reckless wars, open borders, rampant crime, and totally disastrous one-way trade deals.
[00:26:52.138 --> 00:26:54.180]  We're changing that one around very quickly.
[00:26:56.758 --> 00:27:08.492]  They believe America is the world's piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy, military, and defense of every other nation in the world but our own.
[00:27:08.492 --> 00:27:11.876]  It's not happening anymore.
[00:27:11.876 --> 00:27:13.518]  Our political opposition
[00:27:14.412 --> 00:27:35.172]  made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens and you know that's what's been happening and that's why 2016 was so important and that's why 2020 I can never say it's more important but you know it's like the roots of a tree you plant the baby tree it's got a catch
[00:27:36.053 --> 00:27:37.735]  Get that extra time.
[00:27:37.735 --> 00:27:39.598]  We'll have more tax cuts.
[00:27:39.598 --> 00:27:42.001]  We'll have even... I'll tell you what.
[00:27:42.001 --> 00:27:44.124]  We have rebuilt our military.
[00:27:44.124 --> 00:27:49.811]  What we've done has never been done before.
[00:27:49.811 --> 00:27:53.336]  They had President Trump talking about how important 2016 was and how important 2020 will be.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:05.586]  You know, one of the main reasons why he won or why his base was so energized, especially online back in 2016, was the power of memes.
[00:28:05.586 --> 00:28:10.989]  In fact, there were studies done into the effectiveness of memes, one in particular by University College London.
[00:28:11.693 --> 00:28:19.238]  Which found that the most effective memes spread in two places back in 2016 to help propel Trump to victory.
[00:28:19.238 --> 00:28:24.561]  One of them was the subreddit, The Donald, which of course has since been quarantined by Reddit.
[00:28:24.561 --> 00:28:28.043]  And the other one was of course 4chan.
[00:28:28.043 --> 00:28:39.631]  Now in the months and the years since that time, we've seen Instagram, Facebook and Twitter try in a myriad of different ways to crack down and censor political memes.
[00:28:40.194 --> 00:28:44.796]  And when we get back, I'm going to explain the latest offensive on that front.
[00:28:44.796 --> 00:28:56.721]  As 4chan itself prepares to relaunch their It's Okay To Be White stunt, we're going to talk about what Twitter is doing to once again censor and ban memes.
[00:28:56.721 --> 00:29:04.424]  Wait until you hear this new language that they've come out with, which is blatantly targeted towards banning memes.
[00:29:04.424 --> 00:29:07.326]  This is the Alex Jones Show live breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[00:29:07.326 --> 00:29:07.766]  We'll be back.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:14.023]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[00:29:14.023 --> 00:29:19.126]  Now, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[00:29:19.126 --> 00:29:26.850]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:34.735]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[00:29:34.895 --> 00:29:36.696]  Not a security IPO or note.
[00:29:36.696 --> 00:29:46.221]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[00:29:46.221 --> 00:29:47.062]  Don't miss this one.

[00:29:48.943 --> 00:29:51.064]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[00:29:51.064 --> 00:29:51.284]  Call now.
[00:29:51.284 --> 00:29:51.344]  800-600-3388.
[00:29:51.344 --> 00:29:51.384]  800-600-3388.
[00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:14.676]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[00:30:14.676 --> 00:30:17.717]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[00:30:17.717 --> 00:30:22.139]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[00:30:22.139 --> 00:30:28.742]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:35.207]  They might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[00:30:35.207 --> 00:30:40.592]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[00:30:40.592 --> 00:30:48.179]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[00:30:48.359 --> 00:30:49.260]  It's that simple.
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:55.443]  Find out about the iodine conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[00:30:55.443 --> 00:30:59.246]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research iodine deficiency.
[00:30:59.246 --> 00:31:01.187]  It's the key to everything.
[00:31:01.187 --> 00:31:10.753]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality iodine and bio-crystallinium at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[00:31:10.753 --> 00:31:12.494]  Here are the facts.
[00:31:13.775 --> 00:31:22.865]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies including the American Medical Journal.
[00:31:22.865 --> 00:31:29.292]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility.
[00:31:29.292 --> 00:31:29.613]  That's
[00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:33.480]  Conspiracy.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.583]  And then once you've learned about it, protect yourself and your family.
[00:31:36.583 --> 00:31:42.729]  The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine.
[00:31:42.729 --> 00:31:48.754]  In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people under their control.
[00:31:48.754 --> 00:31:50.916]  The globalists are targeting us here.
[00:31:50.916 --> 00:31:52.838]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:52.838 --> 00:31:56.642]  Experience iodine and biotruth selenium that goes with it together.
[00:31:56.642 --> 00:31:58.063]  And then once you see the great results,
[00:31:58.283 --> 00:31:59.324]  Warn others.
[00:31:59.324 --> 00:32:01.445]  This is the Achilles heel of the globalist.
[00:32:01.445 --> 00:32:02.686]  It's a win-win situation.
[00:32:02.686 --> 00:32:04.407]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[00:32:04.407 --> 00:32:05.028]  Take action now.
[00:32:09.537 --> 00:32:11.659]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[00:32:11.659 --> 00:32:14.441]  I'm Wilbur Snakeland.
[00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:36.139]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro to the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:49.123]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad.
[00:32:49.123 --> 00:32:52.464]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[00:32:52.464 --> 00:32:53.664]  There's no medical journals.
[00:32:53.664 --> 00:32:55.144]  There's no facts.
[00:32:55.144 --> 00:32:56.605]  You need fluoride.
[00:32:56.605 --> 00:33:05.427]  Just drink extra fluoride and then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[00:33:12.239 --> 00:33:14.884]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:34.884 --> 00:33:47.871]  We're live, and there's a headline up on summit.news, a story that I wrote yesterday, which ties into this whole effort, this affront to ban memes, which has restarted in anticipation of the 2020 election.
[00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:52.713]  Headline, 4chan trolls planning to relaunch it's okay to be white stunt.
[00:33:52.713 --> 00:34:03.139]  Of course, they first did this back in 2017 as a way to troll the media and progressives into revealing the fact that they are in fact the true racists, which you saw again.
[00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:15.414]  With the election of Canada's first black president, Justin Trudeau, last night, who of course is the number one black-faced enthusiast across the entire planet.
[00:34:15.414 --> 00:34:25.681]  Progressives re-elected him, he's got a minority government, but he has been re-elected, proving once again that they don't care if somebody is a racist, so long as that racist is on their team.
[00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:41.464]  Well, that's similar to what 4chan did back in 2017 when they tried to highlight the bigotry of the left by posting these flyers across major cities and campuses that merely say it's okay to be white.
[00:34:41.464 --> 00:34:46.509]  Of course, if anyone is triggered by that, if they have a bad reaction to it, it only shines a light on them.
[00:34:46.509 --> 00:34:48.011]  It only puts up a mirror to their face.
[00:34:48.795 --> 00:34:55.497]  Reveals their own anti-white bigotry because in essence they're saying no it's not okay to be white.
[00:34:55.497 --> 00:35:04.419]  Well now 4chan trolls are planning to repeat the stunt in order to force the media into generating a fresh moral panic about racism.
[00:35:04.419 --> 00:35:09.820]  So a bunch of posts which are featured in this article have appeared on 4chan over the past week or so.
[00:35:11.138 --> 00:35:21.262]  About these posters, and it says that they're going to try the same stunt again on October 31st, Halloween, and try to cause a, quote, media freakout.
[00:35:21.262 --> 00:35:24.243]  They say that it should be even crazier this time.
[00:35:24.243 --> 00:35:29.706]  They're encouraging people to print the posters, to wear costumes, to plaster them everywhere.
[00:35:29.706 --> 00:35:32.447]  And in fact, another post that appeared on 4chan
[00:35:33.834 --> 00:35:43.360]  It was about an unnamed school which has already alerted students and faculty as to the prospect of these deadly posters appearing on campus.
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:55.308]  Yes, the deadly, dastardly threat, posed by pieces of paper with words on them, because of course in clown world everything is a hysterical dog whistle to racism now.
[00:35:55.308 --> 00:35:59.391]  Many have commented the stunt is particularly cunning because it forces the left
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:07.386]  To adopt the ideologically bigoted view that it isn't okay to be white, thus revealing them to be the actual racist.
[00:36:07.386 --> 00:36:10.588]  That is the power of this meme.
[00:36:10.588 --> 00:36:22.758]  And we had a story out of Emmes, Pennsylvania last year, where they had an absolute freak-out after these posters appeared in a few places across the town of Emmes, Pennsylvania.
[00:36:22.758 --> 00:36:24.880]  They were called a distasteful act of vandalism.
[00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:37.393]  In fact, one resident, or I think he may have even been on the board of the council there, Joshua Westbrook, told a local news agency, quote, I mean, we're surrounded by white privilege nowadays.
[00:36:37.393 --> 00:36:38.734]  It's just a fact.
[00:36:38.734 --> 00:36:43.816]  So it is completely racist to say it's OK to be white.
[00:36:43.816 --> 00:36:46.577]  So they're actually preparing to pull the same stunt once again.
[00:36:47.811 --> 00:36:49.672]  On October 31st.
[00:36:49.672 --> 00:36:51.874]  Because that was a very powerful meme.
[00:36:51.874 --> 00:36:57.097]  You can judge that it was a powerful meme by the way the left, by the way the media reacted to it.
[00:36:57.097 --> 00:36:59.439]  Of course completely falling for the bait.
[00:36:59.439 --> 00:37:01.841]  As they did with the OK hand sign.
[00:37:01.841 --> 00:37:04.402]  Being another dog whistle for white supremacy.
[00:37:04.402 --> 00:37:07.044]  Well now we have this headline.
[00:37:07.044 --> 00:37:11.948]  And I'm going to preface it actually before by flashing back to a headline we had on InfoWars.
[00:37:11.948 --> 00:37:15.090]  From May, Instagram to fact check and remove memes.
[00:37:16.047 --> 00:37:20.330]  And that is when Instagram announced that it would begin fact-checking and removing memes.
[00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:25.374]  They would be using 52 global fact-checking partners.
[00:37:25.374 --> 00:37:35.642]  Even though memes aren't even supposed to be factual, they're satirical illustrations or cartoons mainly, to censor false photos and memes on its platform.
[00:37:35.642 --> 00:37:37.684]  That was happening back in May.
[00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:48.506]  And as I wrote in the article at the time, quite why memes have to be fact-checked at all, given they're almost always satirical, and are not intended to be statements of fact may be a mystery to some.
[00:37:48.506 --> 00:38:08.722]  It's actually not a mystery at all, because even a vice write-up of a study by the University College London found that the most effective memes in 2016 that helped propel Donald Trump to election originated in two places, the subreddit The Donald, which has now been castrated and quarantined by Reddit,
[00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:13.973]  And, of course, the poll forum on 4chan.
[00:38:13.973 --> 00:38:19.376]  And then you had BuzzFeed lobbying Twitter to ban a meme which made fun of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
[00:38:19.376 --> 00:38:33.065]  You had Facebook announcing the deployment of a large-scale AI program called Rosetta, which would, quote, automatically proactively identify inappropriate or harmful content in images on social networks.
[00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:54.384]  The left can't meme, so it's so much easier to ban memes, and academic studies have proven that those memes were really successful in energising Trump's base, helping him build that enthusiasm during 2016, which is why the left, the progressive networks, are in a blind panic about the power of memes.
[00:38:54.384 --> 00:38:58.969]  Remember on Twitter, they were banning people, in fact that's why James Woods
[00:38:59.815 --> 00:39:00.716]  Was suspended.
[00:39:00.716 --> 00:39:15.067]  I can't recall if he ever actually came back to Twitter after this for posting a satirical meme which encouraged male democratic voters to stay at home during the 2018 midterms to allow women to express their voice.
[00:39:15.067 --> 00:39:16.068]  Of course, that's a joke.
[00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:20.152]  Making them stay at home would make Democrats lose the election.
[00:39:20.152 --> 00:39:21.993]  That's a point, it's a joke.
[00:39:21.993 --> 00:39:30.719]  But Twitter and Facebook then embarked on a program of not only taking those memes down, but suspending and banning users who posted them.
[00:39:30.719 --> 00:39:36.543]  I remember I was suspended back when I had a Facebook account, before they banned me entirely for being a dangerous person.
[00:39:36.543 --> 00:39:39.185]  Suspended for a month for posting that very meme.
[00:39:40.532 --> 00:39:57.042]  There's a war on memes because the left can't meme, and because memes are entirely effective and dangerous to their agenda, because they have no sense of humour, because they're permanently walking on eggshells, petrified of offending anybody with humour, which is why they're so terrible at memes.
[00:39:57.042 --> 00:40:00.424]  We have this headline out of nationalfile.com.
[00:40:00.424 --> 00:40:05.607]  Twitter gears up for meme ban ahead of 2020.
[00:40:05.607 --> 00:40:08.809]  They announced yesterday Twitter safety.
[00:40:08.809 --> 00:40:10.030]  Keeping everyone safe?
[00:40:10.686 --> 00:40:22.675]  That for everyone's safety, because they really care about you, they will soon be limiting, quote, synthetic and manipulated media, otherwise known as memes, on the social platform.
[00:40:22.675 --> 00:40:25.017]  Bear in mind, that's not just memes.
[00:40:25.017 --> 00:40:36.866]  When they say manipulated media, that is anything that they claim was manipulated by the political right to negatively impact Democrats, Progressives or Left.
[00:40:36.866 --> 00:40:37.627]  You will remember,
[00:40:38.263 --> 00:40:40.605]  The Jim Acosta hand slap.
[00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:46.570]  The infamous hand slap against the White House intern back in, I think it was November last year.
[00:40:46.570 --> 00:41:01.241]  They had an entire media narrative that I had personally faked a video of Jim Acosta slapping down an intern's hand or at least sped it up or manipulated the footage to try and paint a different narrative.
[00:41:01.241 --> 00:41:02.362]  That wasn't true.
[00:41:02.362 --> 00:41:03.964]  Never manipulated the footage.
[00:41:03.964 --> 00:41:06.225]  Stood by that from day one to the end.
[00:41:06.225 --> 00:41:06.746]  Didn't matter.
[00:41:07.478 --> 00:41:12.203]  They claimed it was manipulated, so that's why they're doing this.
[00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:22.074]  Synthetic and manipulated media is any media that they claim has been altered, so then they can immediately remove it before it goes viral.
[00:41:22.074 --> 00:41:25.978]  Now yes, obviously that includes deepfake technology.
[00:41:26.812 --> 00:41:28.914]  Which many people have said is a threat to democracy.
[00:41:28.914 --> 00:41:30.475]  Yes, that will get removed.
[00:41:30.475 --> 00:41:32.756]  But again, it's this broad brush.
[00:41:32.756 --> 00:41:34.998]  It's this pushing the boundaries.
[00:41:34.998 --> 00:41:36.779]  What is deemed synthetic?
[00:41:36.779 --> 00:41:38.561]  What is deemed fake news?
[00:41:38.561 --> 00:41:44.905]  Beforehand, they never said they would remove quote fake news because fake news is entirely subjective.
[00:41:44.905 --> 00:41:49.749]  You've seen how many times Snopes gets it wrong because they have a biased partisan left-wing agenda.
[00:41:50.501 --> 00:41:52.882]  Fake news to some people is reality to other people.
[00:41:52.882 --> 00:41:54.143]  Doesn't mean there isn't fake news.
[00:41:54.143 --> 00:41:55.004]  There is.
[00:41:55.004 --> 00:41:58.846]  But again, it's degrees of variation and it's degrees of subjectivity.
[00:41:58.846 --> 00:42:02.608]  So of course this is going to be abuse to ban memes.
[00:42:02.608 --> 00:42:04.629]  Article continues.
[00:42:04.629 --> 00:42:15.975]  After Donald Trump's unprecedented 2016 victory against Hillary Clinton, against mammoth odds, most right-leaning Twitter users have witnessed a severe backlash in the form of censorship and shadow banning on major social media platforms.
[00:42:16.949 --> 00:42:24.037]  But now Twitter has announced, and this is their quote from Twitter safety yesterday, what is synthetic and manipulated media?
[00:42:24.037 --> 00:42:33.108]  It's media that's been significantly altered or created in a way that changes the original meaning purpose, makes it seem like certain events took place that didn't actually happen.
[00:42:34.085 --> 00:42:36.086]  That describes memes!
[00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:45.688]  That describes the Nickelback video where they held up the photograph and it was Joe Biden and his son doing corrupt business dealings with Ukrainians.
[00:42:45.688 --> 00:42:58.272]  Twitter took that down as a result of a claimed copyright violation, but that would fit entirely into this new definition of manipulated media, when of course it wasn't manipulated, it was a satirical meme
[00:42:58.892 --> 00:43:00.713]  ...meant to make a point.
[00:43:00.713 --> 00:43:06.458]  Now with this new announcement, that gives them carte blanche to ban that precise kind of thing.
[00:43:06.458 --> 00:43:08.979]  We'll be back, InfoWars.com, don't go away.
[00:43:08.979 --> 00:43:19.987]  ...on all things considered, I'm Wilbur Snakely, to tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[00:43:19.987 --> 00:43:23.770]  Now sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that
[00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:30.058]  It's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[00:43:30.058 --> 00:43:30.959]  That's right.
[00:43:30.959 --> 00:43:31.920]  Drink the fuck up.
[00:43:32.813 --> 00:43:39.337]  Don't visit Infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen, I mean the bad halogen, iodine.
[00:43:39.337 --> 00:43:42.858]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[00:43:42.858 --> 00:43:49.302]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us.
[00:43:49.302 --> 00:43:50.983]  We don't want to compete with you.
[00:43:50.983 --> 00:43:53.624]  Just drink the fluoride.
[00:43:53.624 --> 00:43:54.865]  Don't learn about
[00:43:55.465 --> 00:43:59.549]  How deadly it is and whatever you do, don't support Alex Jones.
[00:43:59.549 --> 00:44:03.974]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal.
[00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:06.537]  Oh, and let NAMBLA have access to your children, huh?
[00:44:08.391 --> 00:44:19.599]  Again, I'm not talking down to the InfoWars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride, and I'm talking about iodine.
[00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:29.727]  Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an old Glastron boat, and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[00:44:29.727 --> 00:44:32.049]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live.
[00:44:33.041 --> 00:44:34.602]  Okay, it's the same thing.
[00:44:34.602 --> 00:44:37.665]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride.
[00:44:37.665 --> 00:44:40.527]  That's why, in every western nation, they put it in the water.
[00:44:40.527 --> 00:44:42.668]  They're going to teach us Christians to lay down and die.
[00:44:42.668 --> 00:44:44.510]  The Chai Kams don't put it in the water.
[00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:46.031]  They'd execute you if you did that.
[00:44:46.031 --> 00:44:53.997]  They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility, and lifespan, and intelligence, and everything else.
[00:44:53.997 --> 00:44:57.940]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at infowarestore.com.
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.541]  We have all the documents and articles linked.
[00:44:59.841 --> 00:45:04.248]  And then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[00:45:04.248 --> 00:45:06.872]  Again, get iodine at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:45:09.432 --> 00:45:13.474]  InfoWars presents Alex Jones.
[00:45:13.474 --> 00:45:28.279]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious, came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies die in the womb, and it causes cancer.
[00:45:28.279 --> 00:45:30.880]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:38.224]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[00:45:38.224 --> 00:45:46.848]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children.
[00:45:46.848 --> 00:45:53.232]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:45:53.232 --> 00:45:53.512]  Drink
[00:45:53.812 --> 00:45:55.795]  Fluoride and die!
[00:45:55.795 --> 00:45:59.099]  Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over!
[00:45:59.099 --> 00:46:02.663]  Do not visit InfoWarsTore.com and get high poly iodine to counter it.
[00:46:02.663 --> 00:46:02.983]  No!
[00:46:02.983 --> 00:46:05.446]  Roll over and die, dirty Americans!
[00:46:05.446 --> 00:46:08.370]  InfoWars.com forward slash show
[00:46:11.115 --> 00:46:14.817]  Hello here, my name is Bethelme.
[00:46:14.817 --> 00:46:27.262]  I work for my father, Lucifer, and he doesn't like the fact that God gave you all families and children, and so we want to tell you something right now, Christian countries.
[00:46:27.262 --> 00:46:29.723]  We took control of you over a hundred years ago.
[00:46:29.723 --> 00:46:34.745]  We've been spiking your water with fluoride to lower your fertility and to hurt you.
[00:46:35.645 --> 00:46:47.031]  It's worked so well, but now because of liability, and because of people warning inside the government what's happening, the Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done.
[00:46:47.031 --> 00:46:50.912]  It makes me so angry, so whatever you do, just stay in that haze.
[00:46:50.912 --> 00:46:53.153]  You can drink fluoride and give it to your children.
[00:46:55.393 --> 00:47:04.936]  And don't visit InfoWarsTore.com and learn about the Iodine Conspiracy and get 60% off on X2 and X3 together with bio-true selenium from the mustard seed.
[00:47:04.936 --> 00:47:07.577]  Submit to us.
[00:47:07.577 --> 00:47:14.839]  InfoWarsTore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.133 --> 00:47:28.139]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:28.139 --> 00:47:36.030]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:48:06.910]  In Hollywood, in the comic books growing up, the supervillains always hold the world hostage and promise to destroy it if you don't give in to their demands to let them rule the planet.
[00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:10.153]  Because, again, like thinking the brain says, everybody wants to rule the world.
[00:48:11.345 --> 00:48:23.455]  Well, the Club of Rome, a group of powerful robber barons and billionaires, back in the 60s got together and they publicly wrote articles about this and said, we want a way to unify the world into a world government.
[00:48:23.455 --> 00:48:27.979]  And to do that, we're going to make people the bad guys and carbon the bad guy.
[00:48:27.979 --> 00:48:35.225]  And then we'll get everyone to accept paying us carbon taxes and following all of our orders because we're the saviors of the earth.
[00:48:35.785 --> 00:48:36.846]  That's so sick.
[00:48:36.846 --> 00:48:44.254]  When somebody tells you, do what I say or the world's gonna end, they're a cult leader, they're a criminal, they're a threat to everybody.
[00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:54.965]  And they use the whole attack on carbon dioxide and the carbon taxes they want us to pay them as a way to divert away from the genetic engineering, the terminator seeds, the toxic waste dumping, all of it.
[00:48:56.041 --> 00:48:58.803]  These people know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:58.803 --> 00:49:00.484]  They want a post-human world.
[00:49:00.484 --> 00:49:04.666]  And one of their adherents, of course, is Ted Turner, the founder of CNN.
[00:49:04.666 --> 00:49:09.729]  And he set up the Georgia Guidestones that calls for reducing the world down to 500 million people.
[00:49:09.729 --> 00:49:13.732]  And of course, these authoritarians, these savers of the earth, they're going to oversee it all.
[00:49:14.292 --> 00:49:18.235]  Here at InfoWars, we're fighting back against this cult.
[00:49:18.235 --> 00:49:35.306]  We're fighting back against these people that are telling you that you're the bad guys, you've been cast as that, I've been cast as that, and they are the saviors of the earth who are going to fly around on their private jets and live in palaces and have five kids, but you can't have a car, you can't have air conditioning, and you can't have children.
[00:49:35.746 --> 00:49:38.587]  This is a way to make slavery cool again!
[00:49:38.587 --> 00:49:40.007]  Surf them cool again!
[00:49:40.007 --> 00:49:41.947]  And Infowars stands firmly against it.
[00:49:41.947 --> 00:49:44.768]  So whatever you do, remember, your destiny's in your hands.
[00:49:44.768 --> 00:49:52.070]  And when you spread the word about Infowars.com for its last show, and Banned.video, you shake these criminals to their very foundations.
[00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:53.350]  We've reached a tipping point.
[00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:54.450]  Press the attack.
[00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.571]  We will have a pro-human future.
[00:49:57.571 --> 00:50:02.652]  I don't think that we are discussing climate change the way we need to be discussing it.
[00:50:06.437 --> 00:50:11.261]  We are in the midst of climate change right now, and it is only going to get worse.
[00:50:11.261 --> 00:50:14.544]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:20.009]  The scientists also tell us, have 12 years in which to answer that question.
[00:50:20.009 --> 00:50:22.392]  12 years within which to act.
[00:50:22.392 --> 00:50:25.014]  Like, this is the war, this is our World War II.
[00:50:25.014 --> 00:50:28.097]  We have 12 years to turn this around.
[00:50:28.097 --> 00:50:32.701]  We are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes.
[00:50:33.081 --> 00:50:34.482]  10 years that we have left to us.
[00:50:34.482 --> 00:50:40.366]  Within the 10 years that we have left to us, we don't have more than 10 years to get this right.
[00:50:40.366 --> 00:50:42.688]  A little more than 10 years from now.
[00:50:42.688 --> 00:50:50.073]  There is no justice and there is no combating climate change without addressing what has happened to indigenous communities.
[00:50:50.073 --> 00:50:51.534]  I speak to you as a human being.
[00:50:52.435 --> 00:50:59.100]  A woman whose dreams of motherhood now taste bittersweet because of what I know about our children's future.
[00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:03.583]  You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.
[00:51:03.583 --> 00:51:05.124]  This is about our lives.
[00:51:05.124 --> 00:51:07.066]  This is about American lives.
[00:51:07.386 --> 00:51:12.690]  That our community will be uninhabitable, will not sustain human life along this current trajectory.
[00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:15.012]  I am here to say our house is on fire.
[00:51:15.012 --> 00:51:18.454]  It's a crisis that could, at its worst, lead to extinction.
[00:51:18.454 --> 00:51:21.857]  We are in the beginning of a mass extinction.
[00:51:21.857 --> 00:51:23.358]  People are dying.
[00:51:23.358 --> 00:51:25.300]  People are suffering.
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.081]  People are dying.
[00:51:27.081 --> 00:51:27.902]  How dare you?
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:42.324]  Barack and Michelle Obama, they are buying a house in Martha's Vineyard.
[00:51:42.324 --> 00:51:43.184]  I shouldn't say house.
[00:51:43.184 --> 00:51:53.374]  This is a massive, incredible beachfront estate.
[00:51:53.374 --> 00:51:59.239]  Well, you saw the Obama's beachfront estate there, and this ties into an article up on summit.news.
[00:51:59.239 --> 00:52:00.440]  It's top story right now.
[00:52:01.209 --> 00:52:02.689]  So shocking!
[00:52:02.689 --> 00:52:09.971]  Study finds the wealthy and celebrities aren't changing their flying habits to reduce CO2 emissions.
[00:52:09.971 --> 00:52:11.071]  Imagine my shock!
[00:52:11.071 --> 00:52:28.235]  A new study by Swedish Academics has found that most wealthy people and celebrities, such as Bill Gates, are not changing their flying habits to help reduce climate change, with some responsible for a thousand times more CO2 emissions than the average person.
[00:52:28.235 --> 00:52:29.035]  This is a study
[00:52:30.003 --> 00:52:42.546]  Carried out by researchers from Lund University in Sweden, which reviewed the social media accounts of well-known celebrities and wealthy philanthropists, many of whom relentlessly virtue-signal about climate change, you've got to change your life.
[00:52:42.546 --> 00:52:46.046]  Turns out, they're not really changing theirs.
[00:52:46.046 --> 00:52:56.848]  Based on the information posted relating to travel, the researchers calculated the starting point and destination for flights, and then worked out likely CO2 emissions.
[00:52:56.848 --> 00:52:59.129]  And take a rough guess at what they discovered.
[00:53:00.166 --> 00:53:09.771]  Of course, we've got the denizens of the climate change movement, people like Leonardo DiCaprio, literally flying tens of their friends from LA to Paris.
[00:53:09.771 --> 00:53:12.713]  He's taken a private jet to pick up the environmental award.
[00:53:12.713 --> 00:53:18.096]  He flies them all around the world on his private jet to watch his environmentalist documentaries.
[00:53:18.096 --> 00:53:26.140]  He hangs out on a 400-foot boat owned by a Middle Eastern oil sheikh, then goes to a People's Climate Change March.
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:27.721]  Well, he works out a similar situation.
[00:53:28.689 --> 00:53:46.981]  When you look at people like climate activist Bill Gates, who it turns out was responsible for approximately 1,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide, while flights used by Paris Hilton and Jennifer Lopez emitted 1,260 tonnes and 1,050 tonnes, respectively.
[00:53:46.981 --> 00:53:53.045]  These figures, compared to a global average of 100 kilos per person per year for air travel, or in other words,
[00:53:54.167 --> 00:54:03.335]  The CO2 emitted as a result of flights taken by celebrities and wealthy rich people like Bill Gates are more than a thousand times higher.
[00:54:03.335 --> 00:54:12.442]  Similar to Prince Harry, who is of course friends with DiCaprio as well, who is of course friends with Greta Thunberg, who we're going to get on to in a minute.
[00:54:12.442 --> 00:54:19.388]  Prince Harry took four private jet trips in the space of 11 days while lecturing everyone else about global warming.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.422]  Was he trying to save the planet when he was doing that?
[00:54:22.422 --> 00:54:26.005]  No, he was partying in Elton John's mansion!
[00:54:26.005 --> 00:54:31.629]  And then they get up on television, him and Meghan Markle, and say how much of a struggle their lives are.
[00:54:31.629 --> 00:54:32.850]  Such a struggle.
[00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:34.732]  Four private jet trips in 11 days.
[00:54:34.732 --> 00:54:35.232]  So hard.
[00:54:35.232 --> 00:54:37.014]  So hard for them.
[00:54:37.014 --> 00:54:39.416]  According to the researchers of this study in Sweden,
[00:54:40.598 --> 00:54:46.103]  Only a minority of the individuals studied had altered their behaviour to minimise or stop flying.
[00:54:46.103 --> 00:55:04.620]  So out of all the celebrities that they looked at, looked through their social media history, only a tiny amount in the past few years had actually made any effort to minimise flying while lecturing you all day long about, in the case of Prince Charles, infamously once said that you shouldn't take hot baths.
[00:55:05.996 --> 00:55:15.921]  These people are flying around the world to the extent of emitting a thousand times more CO2 than the normal person, but they're still going to wag their finger at you.
[00:55:15.921 --> 00:55:17.502]  And yeah, I get it.
[00:55:17.502 --> 00:55:20.984]  If you're famous, if you're a public figure, you need to travel a lot.
[00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:21.945]  That's fine.
[00:55:21.945 --> 00:55:26.247]  Just don't wag your finger at poor people and tell them they need to change their behaviour.
[00:55:26.849 --> 00:55:37.973]  Like the Extinction Rebellion activists who occupied the meat market in Smithfields in London, literally lecturing working-class people that they were bad for eating meat.
[00:55:37.973 --> 00:55:45.296]  Meanwhile, you know, jetting off to Daddy's Ski Lodge in Stade, Switzerland every six months.
[00:55:45.296 --> 00:55:51.819]  So the researchers themselves found, and by no means is this a right-wing study, it's academics in Sweden for God's sake,
[00:55:53.314 --> 00:55:58.878]  That they had not changed their behaviour at all in the vast majority of cases.
[00:55:58.878 --> 00:56:02.100]  Quote, their lifestyles are norm-setting and identity-building.
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:09.765]  Above all, young people dream of travelling around the world in a similar way, without having to worry about money, said one of the academics involved in the study.
[00:56:09.765 --> 00:56:15.428]  Once again, very much a case of do as we say, not as we do.
[00:56:15.428 --> 00:56:17.750]  And the backlash to this is getting more and more vehement.
[00:56:18.965 --> 00:56:24.348]  You saw Greta Thunberg, the patron saint of climate change, there in the video previously.
[00:56:24.348 --> 00:56:26.309]  Well, now we have this headline, Stop the Lies!
[00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:29.591]  Mural of Greta Thunberg defaced in Canada.
[00:56:29.591 --> 00:56:36.735]  Of course, six months ago, the Germans were putting stickers all over their cars saying, F. Greta Thunberg.
[00:56:36.735 --> 00:56:45.440]  Well, now a mural of eco-activist Greta Thunberg was defaced in Edmonton, Alberta, with the vandal telling Thunberg to stop lecturing him on how to live his life.
[00:56:46.252 --> 00:56:54.000]  So somebody painted a mural of Greta after her infamous, how dare you, rant in front of the UN in September.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:00.966]  Three days later it was defaced by a vandal who spray-painted over it with the words, stop the lies, this is oil country.
[00:57:00.966 --> 00:57:02.308]  This is what he said to CBC.
[00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:05.793]  My father has worked in the oil industry.
[00:57:05.793 --> 00:57:12.020]  We don't need foreigners coming in and telling us how to run our business, support our families, put food on our tables.
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:17.067]  It's absolutely intolerant of them, climate activists, to tell us how to change our lives and our people.
[00:57:17.067 --> 00:57:19.710]  She should go back to her country and try to make her country better.
[00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:22.994]  That would be an uphill task, given that her country is Sweden.
[00:57:24.036 --> 00:57:25.617]  The Progressive Utopia.
[00:57:25.617 --> 00:57:35.080]  But again, Greta Thunberg, when she wrote that letter to the UN, that letter of complaint, did not include India, did not include the biggest polluter in the world, China.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.682]  There's no Greta Thunberg tour of China taking place, is there?
[00:57:40.763 --> 00:57:45.970]  And again, as we previously highlighted, German drivers began displaying FU Greta bumper stickers on their cars.
[00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:47.973]  You've got the yellow vests in France.
[00:57:47.973 --> 00:57:54.442]  You've got the protesters in the Netherlands protesting against livestock reductions, again related to climate change regulation.
[00:57:54.442 --> 00:57:56.866]  The backlash is spreading.
[00:57:56.866 --> 00:57:57.687]  InfoWars.com
[00:57:58.287 --> 00:58:04.191]  What I'm about to say is incredibly obvious and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners.
[00:58:04.191 --> 00:58:05.452]  I'm just stating the facts.
[00:58:05.452 --> 00:58:06.652]  I own a chainsaw.
[00:58:06.652 --> 00:58:08.614]  I've had it since I was in college.
[00:58:08.614 --> 00:58:12.616]  And it's a great good old chainsaw and I've used it probably 500 times.
[00:58:12.616 --> 00:58:19.380]  But a few times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it.
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.502]  Now imagine if somebody told me to put
[00:58:22.262 --> 00:58:25.385]  Let's say superglue in the oil container on it.
[00:58:25.385 --> 00:58:26.826]  It would seize up forever.
[00:58:26.826 --> 00:58:28.607]  But only an evil person would do that.
[00:58:28.607 --> 00:58:31.570]  Well, fluoride's like putting superglue in a chainsaw.
[00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:32.791]  It's gonna make it seize up.
[00:58:32.791 --> 00:58:34.512]  And that's why they put it in the water.
[00:58:34.512 --> 00:58:36.714]  And they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family.
[00:58:36.714 --> 00:58:37.975]  Yes, they're really evil.
[00:58:37.975 --> 00:58:42.879]  Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication.
[00:58:42.879 --> 00:58:43.799]  It's that simple.
[00:58:43.799 --> 00:58:47.422]  I know you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late.
[00:58:47.422 --> 00:58:49.204]  It's part of the iodine conspiracy.

[00:58:51.926 --> 00:58:53.390]  Action against the globalists.
[00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:55.335]  Carbon's everywhere on this planet!
[00:58:55.335 --> 00:58:57.401]  It's almost like we're carbon-based platforms!
[00:58:59.434 --> 00:59:01.435]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[00:59:01.435 --> 00:59:04.336]  I'm Wilbur Snakeland.
[00:59:04.336 --> 00:59:26.025]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro to the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[00:59:27.065 --> 00:59:39.012]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad.
[00:59:39.012 --> 00:59:42.354]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[00:59:42.354 --> 00:59:43.574]  There's no medical journals.
[00:59:43.574 --> 00:59:45.055]  There's no facts.
[00:59:45.055 --> 00:59:46.496]  You need fluoride.
[00:59:46.496 --> 00:59:48.077]  Just drink extra fluoride.
[00:59:49.113 --> 01:00:01.636]  And then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[01:00:01.636 --> 01:00:04.276]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.801]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:22.801 --> 01:00:28.464]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.464 --> 01:00:30.886]  We are into the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:30.886 --> 01:00:43.213]  In the next segment, we're going to go to Laura Loomer, who has had the comeback of all comebacks, outraising the Democratic incumbent there in South Florida and all the GOP candidates combined in her attempted run for Congress.
[01:00:43.213 --> 01:00:46.154]  So we're going to get into that in the next segment.
[01:00:46.154 --> 01:00:48.756]  Meanwhile, back in Clown World UK, which is where I live,
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:01:11.894]  Where we have a 19% increase in violent crime over the course of the last year, where we have acid attacks, where people literally five minutes from where I live get stabbed to death on a weekly basis, it seems almost at this point, where we have chronically underfunded police forces, they are tackling the real problem, which is racist toddlers.
[01:01:11.894 --> 01:01:18.659]  Headline, UK Police Force highlights problem of racist toddlers as part of Hate Crime Awareness Week.
[01:01:19.324 --> 01:01:21.866]  Because of course now everything's a hate crime.
[01:01:21.866 --> 01:01:40.300]  Reports of hate crime are going up just by coincidence which allows the media to create this moral panic hysteria that the UK is a racist country and basically that we've seen the return of fascism when it's one of the most welcoming countries in terms of immigration in the entire world.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:40.701]  Well now
[01:01:41.696 --> 01:01:50.363]  A UK police force created a video which portrayed a white toddler being racist towards another toddler in kindergarten as part of Hate Crime Awareness Week.
[01:01:50.363 --> 01:01:52.705]  This was Devon and Cornwall Police.
[01:01:52.705 --> 01:01:55.247]  They came out with a series of these videos.
[01:01:55.247 --> 01:02:00.812]  In every single video, the bigoted racist person was, you guessed it, white.
[01:02:00.812 --> 01:02:08.859]  Devon and Cornwall Police posted a cartoon video to their official Twitter account, which features a blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl racially abusing a dark-skinned boy.
[01:02:10.228 --> 01:02:12.029]  And the video is in this article.
[01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:21.191]  In the cartoon, the white girl sees a brown boy playing with a toy before walking up to him and telling him, quote, stop playing with those, you're going to make the toys dirty like your skin.
[01:02:21.191 --> 01:02:24.633]  The brown boy immediately starts crying before the teacher intervenes.
[01:02:24.633 --> 01:02:29.954]  The white girl then says, my father said we should not play with people like him because they are different.
[01:02:29.954 --> 01:02:31.855]  It's one of numerous cartoons.
[01:02:31.855 --> 01:02:36.456]  Another one features a white guy grabbing a hijab off of a Muslim woman.
[01:02:36.456 --> 01:02:38.597]  Posted to Twitter by Devon and Cornwall Police.
[01:02:39.252 --> 01:02:43.475]  Where in every case, the racist protagonist is white.
[01:02:43.475 --> 01:02:52.921]  And as Jack Montgomery points out in an article for Breitbart, the cartoons urge the public to report, quote, hateful behaviour, even if it isn't a crime.
[01:02:52.921 --> 01:02:55.202]  So again, it's all in the eye of the beholder.
[01:02:55.202 --> 01:03:00.686]  A lot of people on the left think that voting Leave and supporting Brexit is a hate crime.
[01:03:00.686 --> 01:03:02.387]  They're going to report that too?
[01:03:03.121 --> 01:03:03.762]  Oh, probably.
[01:03:03.762 --> 01:03:16.894]  And then you'll get the hate crime report statistics going up and up and up, which allows the media to create this narrative that there's a massive problem with it, even though it's their own hysteria causing the problem in the first place.
[01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:21.398]  They also offer assurances that, quote, you don't even need evidence.
[01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:24.000]  Just denunciations like we had in Nazi Germany.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:24.380]  Great.
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.302]  No evidence required.
[01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:29.365]  Last week, we highlighted how a chief of police in Britain chose to recognize
[01:03:30.029 --> 01:03:38.775]  International Pronouns Day, which is trending on Twitter all day, by putting out a video warning people that misgendering transgender people was a form of abuse.
[01:03:38.775 --> 01:03:47.840]  We've had people, women, mothers, arrested in their own kitchens and locked up for hours and hours for calling a man a man on the internet.
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:54.945]  And all this is occurring while police budgets are stretched to breaking point and the UK's violent crime rate continues to soar.
[01:03:55.928 --> 01:03:57.969]  What else are UK police investigating?
[01:03:57.969 --> 01:04:04.353]  Well, they're investigating a transgender person being turned down for a porn role as a hate crime.
[01:04:04.353 --> 01:04:11.137]  This is 25-year-old Rhea Cooper, who became the UK's youngest transgender person 10 years ago.
[01:04:11.137 --> 01:04:13.559]  Stunning and brave.
[01:04:13.559 --> 01:04:18.202]  Received messages on WhatsApp from an anonymous photographer who wanted to have sex on camera and sell the tape.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.361]  Lovely stuff.
[01:04:21.361 --> 01:04:27.810]  However, when the photographer found out that Cooper still had male reproductive organs, he said he couldn't work with her because she has a C.
[01:04:28.928 --> 01:04:47.221]  This prompted Cooper to alert Humberside Police to this transphobic behavior and authorities are now investigating whether a hate crime was committed and they did indeed confirm that a potential hate crime is now being investigated because this man, this photographer, didn't want to have sex with somebody who had a penis.
[01:04:47.221 --> 01:04:55.887]  Is that going to extend out to, maybe, dating websites where you have biological men confronting as transgender women
[01:04:56.696 --> 01:05:05.398]  Who come up on dating websites and then maybe if you don't select them, maybe if you're not interested, maybe if you have a little chat with them and say, sorry, I'm not interested, maybe you committed a hate crime.
[01:05:05.398 --> 01:05:05.879]  We'll be back.
[01:05:07.093 --> 01:05:12.636]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[01:05:12.636 --> 01:05:15.657]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[01:05:15.657 --> 01:05:20.080]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:26.683]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[01:05:27.143 --> 01:05:33.166]  They might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[01:05:33.166 --> 01:05:38.528]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[01:05:38.528 --> 01:05:46.111]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[01:05:46.311 --> 01:05:47.191]  It's that simple.
[01:05:47.191 --> 01:05:53.415]  Find out about the Iodine Conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[01:05:53.415 --> 01:05:57.197]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research Iodine Deficiency.
[01:05:57.197 --> 01:05:59.138]  It's the key to everything.
[01:05:59.138 --> 01:06:06.742]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality Iodine and BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:06:18.467 --> 01:06:24.590]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:24.590 --> 01:06:32.395]  Well, the Daily Caller came out with a big article earlier today, which we also posted up on Infowars.com.
[01:06:32.395 --> 01:06:38.318]  Experts explain possible reasons behind a 56% jump in youth suicide rate in 10 years.
[01:06:38.318 --> 01:06:44.081]  Absolute explosion of suicides amongst young people in America, and generally across the country there's been a 30% increase in suicides.
[01:06:46.815 --> 01:06:52.939]  What are the reasons and what impact has social media had on that dramatic spike in suicides?
[01:06:52.939 --> 01:06:56.321]  It's a problem that the mainstream media is not talking about.
[01:06:56.321 --> 01:07:06.387]  They bang on all day about a stigma around depression and people not being able to talk about it, even though people talk about it more than ever.
[01:07:06.387 --> 01:07:09.829]  And yet depression and suicide seems to be going up more than ever.
[01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:11.490]  There was a clip
[01:07:12.555 --> 01:07:21.818]  Jordan Peterson, who's had many personal problems of his own over the past six months or so, of course his wife nearly died, crying during an interview.
[01:07:21.818 --> 01:07:27.260]  Of course his haters mobbed onto that and basically said, oh poor baby, why are you crying?
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:38.184]  These are the same people, the same progressives, who bang on all day about mental health awareness, bang on all day about how depressed they are and how you can't criticize them because it triggers their depression.
[01:07:38.604 --> 01:07:49.212]  As soon as anyone shows emotional vulnerability on the political right, they steam in and mob attack them and viciously savage them as they did with Dr. Jordan Peterson yesterday.
[01:07:49.212 --> 01:07:53.114]  So I'm going to get into that later on in this hour.
[01:07:53.114 --> 01:07:57.517]  But for the time being, we're joined by Laura Loomer and this is a headline out of the Epoch Times.
[01:07:57.517 --> 01:08:02.641]  Florida congressional candidate Laura Loomer outraises incumbent Lois Frankel in third quarter.
[01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:09.870]  She's outraised, not only outraised the incumbent, she's outraised all the GOP candidates combined.
[01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:14.353]  Frankel, aged 71, the incumbent Democrat, raised around $104,000 in the third quarter.
[01:08:14.353 --> 01:08:19.517]  Record show, Luma raised $154,000 in the third quarter, despite being without a platform on major social media websites.
[01:08:28.388 --> 01:08:31.032]  Laura, it's the comeback of all comebacks.
[01:08:31.032 --> 01:08:35.557]  The enemies of free speech say de-platforming works.
[01:08:35.557 --> 01:08:37.300]  Hasn't really worked on you, has it?
[01:08:39.372 --> 01:08:40.553]  No, it's not really working.
[01:08:40.553 --> 01:08:42.774]  And thanks so much for having me on, Paul.
[01:08:42.774 --> 01:08:44.416]  Pleasure to be back on InfoWars.
[01:08:44.416 --> 01:08:52.601]  And, you know, when I filed my candidacy and my congressional race on August 2nd, people on the right and the left mocked me.
[01:08:52.601 --> 01:08:56.944]  People said, oh, this is just an attempt for Laura Loomer to get back on Twitter.
[01:08:56.944 --> 01:08:58.445]  She won't raise a dime.
[01:08:58.445 --> 01:09:02.228]  And not only have I raised more than a dime, but I raised more than all of my
[01:09:02.668 --> 01:09:10.593]  GOP primary opponents and the four-term Democrat incumbents whose best friends with Nancy Pelosi combined.
[01:09:10.593 --> 01:09:18.619]  And I did so while being banned on every single social media platform and while being completely defamed and maligned by the press.
[01:09:18.619 --> 01:09:27.605]  Every single week since I filed my candidacy, there have been articles in the local paper calling me a far-right member of the alt-right.
[01:09:27.605 --> 01:09:29.566]  You know, things that are just not true.
[01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:30.887]  They say I'm anti-Muslim.
[01:09:30.887 --> 01:09:31.888]  They say I'm a racist.
[01:09:32.907 --> 01:09:37.350]  They called me a troll and said that my candidacy had no legitimacy.
[01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:39.811]  But look, I'm on a mission to win and I'm in this to win.
[01:09:39.811 --> 01:09:43.133]  And I am going to win and flip this district red.
[01:09:43.133 --> 01:09:45.295]  And when I get elected, I'm going to break up big tech.
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.362]  Now, just explain to people how you've done this.
[01:09:49.362 --> 01:09:58.808]  How have you whipped up this enthusiasm and raised such a substantial sum of money with no quote-unquote mainstream social media presence?
[01:09:58.808 --> 01:10:03.311]  Is it just, you know, relentless campaigning, canvassing, doing interviews?
[01:10:03.311 --> 01:10:07.414]  How have you done it without the big networks, Twitter and Facebook?
[01:10:08.294 --> 01:10:09.955]  Well, I'm working very hard.
[01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:16.077]  You know, people, believe it or not, people in this country won elections without social media.
[01:10:16.077 --> 01:10:17.557]  And politics is local.
[01:10:17.557 --> 01:10:24.380]  And the left and, you know, these fake news media reporters, they seem to think that the world revolves around Twitter.
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:30.602]  They seem to think that there is no life outside of Twitter and there is no life offline.
[01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:33.343]  But the fact of the matter is only a small portion
[01:10:34.537 --> 01:10:38.962]  of the country is using Twitter on a daily basis.
[01:10:38.962 --> 01:10:45.648]  And while it is a lot, and while a lot of discussion is taking place on Twitter, you have to go out and talk to people.
[01:10:45.648 --> 01:10:47.150]  You have to meet people.
[01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:52.936]  And the Twitter trolls and the left-wing media reporters aren't the people who are voting for me, right?
[01:10:52.936 --> 01:10:55.138]  There is a whole entire base of constituents
[01:10:55.638 --> 01:11:08.608]  And so they can convince themselves that I'm not going to win and they can convince themselves that I'm a loser and they can trash me in their inner circles and get off on banning people, but they're not in my district.
[01:11:08.608 --> 01:11:13.292]  And I'm getting a lot of support from people in my district, including Democrats and Independents.
[01:11:13.692 --> 01:11:14.072]  Thank you.
[01:11:31.519 --> 01:11:38.040]  You know, when I'm elected to Congress, and I will be elected to Congress, I'm going to fight for all Americans and their free speech.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.761]  Not just Republicans, but Democrats as well.
[01:11:40.761 --> 01:11:42.541]  Because that's what being an American is.
[01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:53.263]  It's about standing up for speech that you disagree with, even if you don't like the person who is saying that speech, for the sake of having a diverse array of thoughts and conversation.
[01:11:53.263 --> 01:11:57.864]  And so I'm really excited, and I'm looking forward to continuing to outrace my opponents.
[01:11:58.644 --> 01:12:06.509]  I'm really looking forward to meeting more of my constituents, and shocking the nation, and shocking big tech, and flipping this district red.
[01:12:06.509 --> 01:12:12.253]  And if you want to be a part of my historic campaign, you can go to LauraLumerForCongress.com and you can support me.
[01:12:12.253 --> 01:12:14.935]  It's a grassroots initiative, so every dollar counts.
[01:12:14.935 --> 01:12:18.037]  Whether it's $1, $5, $10, $20, or the max donation for an individual of $5,600.
[01:12:18.037 --> 01:12:18.977]  We can all make a difference.
[01:12:23.941 --> 01:12:27.283]  And, you know, you have to be a United States citizen to donate.
[01:12:27.283 --> 01:12:35.750]  But, you know, regardless of where you are in the world, you can share my links and post it all over social media, since I can't.
[01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:41.214]  Yeah, I was looking at the numbers about the number of active Americans on Twitter a few weeks ago.
[01:12:41.214 --> 01:12:43.396]  I think it came down to about 10%.
[01:12:43.396 --> 01:12:46.918]  Only about 10% of Americans are actually active on Twitter.
[01:12:46.918 --> 01:12:47.359]  And, of course,
[01:12:48.304 --> 01:12:56.409]  Only a fraction of those are actually going to be politically engaged, so it really is a small bubble when you extrapolate it out to the total population.
[01:12:56.409 --> 01:13:00.671]  Should you win though, and obviously it's going to be a task, I'm going to get onto that in a minute,
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:05.165]  What measures are you going to take against big tech giants who ban you?
[01:13:05.165 --> 01:13:08.669]  Are you going to go down the Elizabeth Warren route of trying to break them up?
[01:13:08.669 --> 01:13:17.339]  Or are you just going to apply Section 230 or amend Section 230 to make them legally culpable for what users post on their websites?
[01:13:17.339 --> 01:13:20.483]  What route are you going to take in your action against big tech?
[01:13:22.102 --> 01:13:23.463]  Well, that's a great question.
[01:13:23.463 --> 01:13:26.444]  And look, the fact is that we already have laws on the books.
[01:13:26.444 --> 01:13:33.067]  We don't necessarily need to create new laws or legislation to deal with big tech and the tyrants who control these companies.
[01:13:33.067 --> 01:13:38.969]  I think that, you know, we all know that there are two sets of rules in this country as to whether you're a Republican or a Democrat.
[01:13:38.969 --> 01:13:41.930]  And if a Republican were to lie to Congress, they would be jailed.
[01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:44.111]  They would be locked up for committing perjury.
[01:13:44.111 --> 01:13:46.012]  And we have the evidence to show that
[01:13:46.372 --> 01:13:57.519]  Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai all committed perjury when they lied to Congress when they testified under oath and said that they were not censoring conservatives and trying to influence and interfere in U.S.
[01:13:57.519 --> 01:13:58.319]  elections.
[01:13:58.319 --> 01:13:59.780]  We've caught them on hidden camera.
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:01.381]  Project Veritas has the tapes.
[01:14:01.801 --> 01:14:02.021]  Right.
[01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:05.723]  We have statements from Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg himself.
[01:14:05.723 --> 01:14:08.023]  All you have to do is really watch the Joe Rogan interview.
[01:14:08.023 --> 01:14:12.645]  And Jack Dorsey, you know, has has has perjured himself time over.
[01:14:12.645 --> 01:14:16.347]  And again, I mean, he told Joe Rogan that social media is a human right.
[01:14:16.347 --> 01:14:22.009]  So by his own words, his own statements, he's committed millions of human rights violations by banning people.
[01:14:22.489 --> 01:14:31.684]  You know, you have executives caught on camera at Google and Twitter admitting to Veritas undercover reporters where I used to work.
[01:14:31.684 --> 01:14:33.106]  Yeah, we censored conservatives.
[01:14:33.106 --> 01:14:34.428]  Yeah, we censored Laura Loomer.
[01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:35.991]  Yeah, we're censoring President Trump.
[01:14:37.828 --> 01:14:42.273]  As a member of Congress, I'm going to make sure that Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg are jailed.
[01:14:42.273 --> 01:14:45.156]  Because they deserve to go to jail because they have committed perjury.
[01:14:45.156 --> 01:14:47.739]  And it's time that we uphold the law equally.
[01:14:47.739 --> 01:14:52.184]  Because as Nancy Pelosi always says, nobody is above the law.
[01:14:52.184 --> 01:14:52.745]  And you know what?
[01:14:52.745 --> 01:14:54.507]  I agree with Nancy Pelosi on that.
[01:14:54.507 --> 01:14:58.071]  So let's hold Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sundar accountable.
[01:15:00.461 --> 01:15:02.684]  Yeah, you mentioned Pikai there.
[01:15:02.684 --> 01:15:08.171]  He got up in front of Congress and said Google doesn't manually intervene, that they're non-partisan.
[01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:17.622]  Google also came out with a statement at the time, quote, Google has never manipulated or modified the search results or content in any of its products to promote a particular political ideology.
[01:15:18.323 --> 01:15:36.611]  On its face, a bald-faced lie, they amended the search results on YouTube days before the referendum on banning abortion in Ireland to make the anti-abortion results, to bury the anti-abortion results and to make the pro-abortion results higher in the search results.
[01:15:36.611 --> 01:15:43.074]  That's a direct example of them manipulating their own algorithm to swing the result of a referendum.
[01:15:43.454 --> 01:15:47.857]  We've also seen it elsewhere, you know, the very fact that they promote authoritative sources.
[01:15:47.857 --> 01:15:49.398]  Who is authoritative?
[01:15:49.398 --> 01:15:53.401]  CNN, ABC News, CBS, anyone who tows the line.
[01:15:53.401 --> 01:15:55.562]  So they've been caught doing it over and over again.
[01:15:55.562 --> 01:16:03.447]  When we get back after the break, I want to talk about how you're going to win this race and what you plan to do campaign-wise to be successful.

[01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:36.930]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:40.852]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:40.852 --> 01:17:42.392]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:42.392 --> 01:17:45.354]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:45.354 --> 01:17:50.916]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:52.117]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:52.117 --> 01:17:55.038]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:55.038 --> 01:17:57.259]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:57.259 --> 01:18:01.701]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:18:01.701 --> 01:18:04.003]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:18:08.724 --> 01:18:12.405]  Hello here, my name is Bethelme.
[01:18:12.405 --> 01:18:15.246]  I work for my father, Lucifer.
[01:18:15.246 --> 01:18:24.869]  And he doesn't like the fact that God gave you all families and children and so... We want to tell you something right now, Christian countries.
[01:18:24.869 --> 01:18:27.310]  We took control of you over a hundred years ago.
[01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:32.332]  We've been spiking your water with fluoride to lower your fertility and to hurt you.
[01:18:33.092 --> 01:18:44.645]  And it's worked so well, but now because of liability and because of people warning inside the government what's happening, the Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done.
[01:18:44.645 --> 01:18:46.007]  And it makes me so angry.
[01:18:46.007 --> 01:18:50.752]  So whatever you do, just stay in that haze and drink fluoride and give it to your children.
[01:18:52.987 --> 01:19:02.546]  And go visit InfoWarsTore.com and learn about the Iodine Conspiracy and get 60% off on X2 and X3 together with BioCrew Selenium from the mustard seed.
[01:19:02.546 --> 01:19:03.367]  Submit to us!
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.681]  Infowarstore.com!
[01:19:23.408 --> 01:19:29.152]  It's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[01:19:29.152 --> 01:19:31.934]  That's right, drink the fluoride.
[01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:37.738]  Don't visit Infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen, I mean the bad halogen.
[01:19:37.738 --> 01:19:41.241]  Iodine, don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[01:19:41.981 --> 01:19:48.405]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us.
[01:19:48.405 --> 01:19:50.086]  We don't want to compete with you.
[01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:52.747]  Just drink the fluoride.
[01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:56.510]  Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do.
[01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:58.671]  Don't support Alex Jones.
[01:19:58.671 --> 01:20:03.093]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal.
[01:20:03.093 --> 01:20:05.235]  Oh, and let Nambla have access to your children.
[01:20:10.603 --> 01:20:20.132]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.132 --> 01:20:27.159]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.159 --> 01:20:30.843]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:20:33.775 --> 01:20:38.119]  We're live with Laura Luton, the website is LauraLutonCongress.com.
[01:20:38.119 --> 01:20:39.340]  Go there and donate.
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:43.043]  I'm going to ask Laura about her lawsuit against Facebook later on.
[01:20:43.043 --> 01:20:46.987]  $3 billion, which is 5% of their entire net worth.
[01:20:46.987 --> 01:20:49.249]  We're going to get into that.
[01:20:49.249 --> 01:20:54.433]  Basically everybody who helped Trump get elected was punished in one way or another, weren't they, after 2016.
[01:20:54.433 --> 01:21:00.699]  Whether it was lawsuits, whether it was mass social media banning, whether it was in fact jail time for some people.
[01:21:01.443 --> 01:21:05.986]  I would say that Laura, as I said at the start of this interview, has made the comeback of all comebacks.
[01:21:05.986 --> 01:21:11.749]  Many people reacted to those bans by just going behind paywalls and so forth.
[01:21:11.749 --> 01:21:18.033]  Laura said, no, I'm going to get back at you by actually running for Congress, winning and changing the law.
[01:21:18.033 --> 01:21:27.659]  Now, Laura, as far as I understand, correct me if I'm wrong, they can't prevent elected members of Congress from having a social media presence.
[01:21:27.659 --> 01:21:29.420]  Correct me if I'm wrong on that.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:30.281]  But if you win,
[01:21:30.875 --> 01:21:32.236]  Do you think they'll let you back on?
[01:21:34.158 --> 01:21:46.848]  Well, they should have already let me back on, and this is what's so egregious about it, Paul, is that I am a declared candidate now outperforming the sitting four-term Democrat incumbent who's best friends with Pelosi, okay?
[01:21:46.848 --> 01:21:48.710]  And I don't have social media.
[01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:51.372]  So I did all this while having no social media.
[01:21:51.372 --> 01:21:53.273]  I can't use PayPal for my campaign.
[01:21:53.273 --> 01:21:55.595]  I can't use Twitter.
[01:21:55.595 --> 01:21:56.636]  I can't use Facebook.
[01:21:56.636 --> 01:21:57.356]  I don't have anything.
[01:21:57.356 --> 01:21:58.237]  I don't have Instagram.
[01:21:58.237 --> 01:22:01.760]  And every other candidate in this country has access to all those platforms.
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:11.069]  I'm the only candidate in this country running for office who has completely denied equal access to the Internet, which has a monetary value.
[01:22:11.069 --> 01:22:21.700]  And I would argue that this is an FEC violation, because what you have here is essentially an in-kind contribution from these big tech social media companies to the Democrat Party.
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:38.749]  And I don't know why the Republican Party or the Republican Party of Florida hasn't filed a massive lawsuit against these companies or filed an FEC complaint because this is going to affect fundraising for all Republican candidates across the country because we're being shadow banned.
[01:22:38.749 --> 01:22:41.511]  Those who have social media, I don't have any.
[01:22:41.511 --> 01:22:49.375]  And think of all the millions of dollars in money that Republican candidates across the board are missing out on due to social media censorship.
[01:22:49.375 --> 01:22:50.496]  So this is going to have
[01:22:50.856 --> 01:22:51.276]  I think so.
[01:23:17.946 --> 01:23:26.435]  If you are silenced and your voice is suppressed by these fascists and big tech, then you can't talk about these other issues.
[01:23:26.435 --> 01:23:27.716]  You can't talk.
[01:23:27.716 --> 01:23:29.037]  You can't talk.
[01:23:29.037 --> 01:23:31.299]  So we really need to do something about it.
[01:23:32.498 --> 01:23:49.917]  I don't know why people like Roger Stone and General Flynn are being threatened with being imprisoned for many years to come and having to sell their homes in order to pay for their legal fees when people like Jack Dorsey, Zuckerberg, and Sundar Pichai are getting away.
[01:23:50.437 --> 01:23:52.278]  They lied to Congress.
[01:23:52.278 --> 01:23:56.980]  And so when I'm elected, like I said, I'm going to make sure that the law is upheld equally.
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:24:00.101]  And I do believe that they need to be prosecuted for committing perjury.
[01:24:00.101 --> 01:24:03.763]  And another thing, too, you mentioned my lawsuit.
[01:24:03.763 --> 01:24:11.867]  In Facebook's response to my defamation lawsuit, they admitted they perjured themselves even more because they said that they're a publisher.
[01:24:11.867 --> 01:24:14.868]  Well, they testified under oath and said that they're a platform.
[01:24:14.868 --> 01:24:15.468]  So what is it?
[01:24:15.468 --> 01:24:16.329]  Are you a platform?
[01:24:16.329 --> 01:24:17.149]  Are you a publisher?
[01:24:17.629 --> 01:24:26.208]  And so if they truly are a publisher, then it should open the floodgates for every American who has been wrongfully terminated by Facebook to sue them.
[01:24:26.208 --> 01:24:27.491]  But what we need to understand here...
[01:24:28.735 --> 01:24:37.459]  Is that Facebook is trying to gaslight the press and gaslight the judges by bringing the Section 230 argument into my defamation lawsuit.
[01:24:37.459 --> 01:24:39.579]  Because I'm not suing for being banned.
[01:24:39.579 --> 01:24:44.501]  I sued Facebook for defamation because you and I were both defamed, Paul.
[01:24:44.501 --> 01:24:48.123]  They banned us, and then they said that we were dangerous individuals.
[01:24:48.123 --> 01:24:56.026]  And if you look at the classification and the breakdown for what it means to be a dangerous individual, you're either a terrorist... Some child sex traffickers, right?
[01:24:56.887 --> 01:24:59.209]  Yeah, a sex trafficker or a serial killer.
[01:24:59.209 --> 01:25:07.098]  And then on top of that, I remember it was like 2 o'clock in the morning and I get a message from you on WhatsApp and you're like, oh my God, they want us dead.
[01:25:07.098 --> 01:25:08.259]  And I was like, what do you mean?
[01:25:08.259 --> 01:25:10.001]  And you told me to click the link.
[01:25:10.001 --> 01:25:13.025]  And they literally declared open season on our lives.
[01:25:13.025 --> 01:25:17.550]  They said that it was okay to post death threats against me and you because we were dangerous individuals.
[01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:21.792]  And they did that the day that I filed my $3 billion lawsuit.
[01:25:21.792 --> 01:25:23.193]  So, Facebook is a bully.
[01:25:23.193 --> 01:25:29.716]  They think that as a form of retaliation, they can just say, go murder Laura Loomer and Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:25:29.716 --> 01:25:34.779]  If they're going to take legal action against us, then we're going to declare that it's okay to murder them.
[01:25:34.779 --> 01:25:42.843]  And so that's why, you know, I amended my lawsuit and now it's amended to include damages for them inciting violence against my life.
[01:25:43.323 --> 01:25:49.946]  And my lawyers just about four days ago, they filed a response to Facebook's motion to have my case dismissed.
[01:25:49.946 --> 01:25:53.207]  And I do believe that this is going to go to trial.
[01:25:53.207 --> 01:25:59.170]  It already has a date set for next October, three weeks before my election here in Florida.
[01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:00.590]  So you're invited.
[01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:01.711]  Alex Jones is invited.
[01:26:02.685 --> 01:26:06.569]  And on top of that lawsuit, I also have a case that is going to be heard in the D.C.
[01:26:06.569 --> 01:26:10.893]  Circuit Court of Appeals that is an antitrust case.
[01:26:10.893 --> 01:26:17.440]  And so hopefully we can get all types of patriots from across this country who have been banned to show up to the D.C.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.445]  Circuit Court of Appeals when my lawyer and I get to deliver our oral appeal.
[01:26:22.445 --> 01:26:26.449]  Because it's going to be historic and I'm willing to take this all the way to the Supreme Court need be.
[01:26:27.069 --> 01:26:36.835]  And, you know, for anyone out there who thinks that one person can't make a difference, I want you to know that, you know, I'm one person and I'm taking on big tech and, you know, I'm going to do it.
[01:26:36.835 --> 01:26:42.359]  I'm going to do it no matter how much people mock me or how much they try to shut me down.
[01:26:42.359 --> 01:26:48.603]  Yeah, just to remind people, this was a few months ago, Facebook literally updated their terms of service to include language where they said,
[01:26:49.429 --> 01:27:04.901]  It's not allowed to violently threaten anyone on our platform, unless we've defamed them, basically, as a dangerous individual, a dangerous person, and then it's completely fine to target these people with death threats and to actually organise violence against them.
[01:27:04.901 --> 01:27:09.765]  They had to remove it a couple of days later, but as he said, it was out there for anyone to see.
[01:27:09.765 --> 01:27:11.327]  Completely defamatory.
[01:27:11.327 --> 01:27:12.768]  Going back to your campaign though,
[01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:18.537]  This seat in South Florida, it's considered safe for Democrats, that's what the media says anyway.
[01:27:18.537 --> 01:27:19.679]  They voted 59-39% for Hillary in 2016.
[01:27:19.679 --> 01:27:20.420]  Frankel ran unopposed in 2018.
[01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:21.823]  How are you going to flip the seat?
[01:27:26.872 --> 01:27:28.772]  Well, it's a D plus 9 seat.
[01:27:28.772 --> 01:27:36.214]  So, Frankel ran unopposed because there wasn't anybody who was probably willing to give her the fight that she should have against her.
[01:27:36.214 --> 01:27:39.895]  So, look, I wouldn't say that I'm a typical candidate, right?
[01:27:39.895 --> 01:27:49.537]  And for anybody who has been following me over the last few years prior to me being banned, if there's one thing to know about me, it's that I accomplished the impossible.
[01:27:49.537 --> 01:27:52.517]  I accomplished that which people say can't be done.
[01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:55.338]  Whether it's putting illegal aliens on Nancy Pelosi's lawn or
[01:27:55.678 --> 01:28:00.379]  Dropping Twitter stock by 8% and handcuffing myself and trending number one multiple times.
[01:28:00.379 --> 01:28:04.640]  I mean, you know, confronting Hillary Clinton and James Comey at their book signing.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:10.181]  I am able to do that which your regular average person, you know, probably couldn't do.
[01:28:10.181 --> 01:28:17.522]  And so I'm not going to give away my campaign strategy because, you know, the left doesn't deserve to know my game plan.
[01:28:17.522 --> 01:28:23.163]  But just know that on election day, they're going to be saying the words, Congresswoman Laura Loomer.
[01:28:23.163 --> 01:28:23.543]  You'll see.
[01:28:24.901 --> 01:28:26.242]  All right, Laura, stay there.
[01:28:26.242 --> 01:28:28.542]  We'll do one more quick segment on the other side.
[01:28:28.542 --> 01:28:33.384]  I also want to ask you about if there's any pushback from the GOP establishment.
[01:28:33.384 --> 01:28:37.025]  Of course, you're running against five other Republican candidates in this race.
[01:28:37.025 --> 01:28:38.306]  Also want to ask you about the
[01:28:38.999 --> 01:28:53.164]  The psychological impact of being basically one of the primary, one of the biggest victims of Social Credit Score USA, with your banning, which is not just, you know, restricting you from social media use, this is what people don't understand.
[01:28:53.164 --> 01:29:02.788]  You're literally, when you do that, cutting someone else from the rest of humanity, when you withdraw their access to what has become the new town square, the public commons.
[01:29:02.788 --> 01:29:05.689]  We'll be back with Laura Loomer, InfoWars.com, don't go away.
[01:29:06.669 --> 01:29:11.731]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[01:30:07.059 --> 01:30:13.203]  Now what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners.
[01:30:13.203 --> 01:30:14.464]  I'm just stating the facts.
[01:30:14.464 --> 01:30:15.665]  I own a chainsaw.
[01:30:15.665 --> 01:30:17.586]  I've had it since I was in college.
[01:30:17.586 --> 01:30:20.468]  And it's a great good old chainsaw and I've used it probably 500 times.
[01:30:20.468 --> 01:30:28.373]  But a few times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it.
[01:30:28.373 --> 01:30:30.515]  Now imagine if somebody told me to put
[01:30:31.255 --> 01:30:34.376]  Let's say superglue in the oil container on it.
[01:30:34.376 --> 01:30:35.817]  It would seize up forever.
[01:30:35.817 --> 01:30:37.598]  But only an evil person would do that.
[01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:40.559]  Well, fluoride's like putting superglue in a chainsaw.
[01:30:40.559 --> 01:30:41.780]  It's going to make it seize up.
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:43.500]  And that's why they put it in the water.
[01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.701]  And they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family.
[01:30:45.701 --> 01:30:46.962]  Yes, they're really evil.
[01:30:46.962 --> 01:30:51.884]  Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication.
[01:30:51.884 --> 01:30:52.785]  It's that simple.
[01:30:52.785 --> 01:30:56.426]  I know you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late.
[01:30:56.426 --> 01:30:58.187]  It's part of the iodine conspiracy.
[01:30:58.187 --> 01:31:00.428]  Find out more at Infowarsstore.com and take
[01:31:00.948 --> 01:31:02.389]  Action against the globalists.
[01:31:02.389 --> 01:31:04.311]  Carbon's everywhere on this planet!
[01:31:04.311 --> 01:31:07.234]  It's almost like we're carbon-based lifeforms!
[01:31:07.234 --> 01:31:18.424]  Again, I'm not talking down to the InfoWars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride, and I'm talking about iodine.
[01:31:18.424 --> 01:31:27.492]  Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an old Glastron boat, and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[01:31:28.525 --> 01:31:30.880]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live.
[01:31:31.866 --> 01:31:33.427]  Okay, it's the same thing.
[01:31:33.427 --> 01:31:36.489]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride.
[01:31:36.489 --> 01:31:39.350]  That's why, in every western nation, they put it in the water.
[01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:41.491]  They're going to teach us Christians to lay down and die.
[01:31:41.491 --> 01:31:43.332]  The Chai Kams don't put it in the water.
[01:31:43.332 --> 01:31:44.853]  They'd execute you if you did that.
[01:31:44.853 --> 01:31:52.818]  They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility, and lifespan, and intelligence, and everything else.
[01:31:52.818 --> 01:31:56.740]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at Infowarstore.com.
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:58.341]  We have all the documents and articles linked.
[01:31:58.661 --> 01:32:03.062]  And then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[01:32:03.062 --> 01:32:08.663]  Again, get iodine at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:32:08.663 --> 01:32:11.724]  Here are the facts.
[01:32:11.724 --> 01:32:20.786]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies, including the American Medical Journal.
[01:32:20.786 --> 01:32:27.227]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer, and destroys fertility.
[01:32:27.227 --> 01:32:27.927]  That's the facts.
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:31.421]  Conspiracy.
[01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:34.523]  And then once you've learned about it, protect yourself and your family.
[01:32:34.523 --> 01:32:40.646]  The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine.
[01:32:40.646 --> 01:32:46.670]  In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people under their control.
[01:32:46.670 --> 01:32:48.831]  The globalists are targeting us here.
[01:32:48.831 --> 01:32:50.772]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:50.772 --> 01:32:54.554]  Experience iodine and biotruth selenium that goes with it together.
[01:32:54.554 --> 01:32:55.975]  And then once you see the great results,
[01:32:56.215 --> 01:32:57.276]  Warn others.
[01:32:57.276 --> 01:32:59.377]  This is the Achilles heel of the globalist.
[01:32:59.377 --> 01:33:00.617]  It's a win-win situation.
[01:33:00.617 --> 01:33:02.338]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[01:33:02.338 --> 01:33:10.222]  Take action now.
[01:33:10.222 --> 01:33:12.843]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:27.697 --> 01:33:33.322]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:33.322 --> 01:33:38.106]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:38.106 --> 01:33:41.029]  We are back with Laura Loomer, lauraloomer4congress.com.
[01:33:41.029 --> 01:33:44.692]  We've got banned by Instagram, banned by Facebook, banned by Twitter.
[01:33:45.894 --> 01:33:49.297]  And the point is, the internet is now basically the public commons.
[01:33:49.297 --> 01:33:51.198]  It is the new town square.
[01:33:51.198 --> 01:33:54.921]  Banning somebody from those platforms is more than just censorship.
[01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:58.743]  In my eyes, it is a form of psychological torture.
[01:33:58.743 --> 01:34:02.026]  You're literally cutting someone else from the rest of humanity.
[01:34:02.026 --> 01:34:07.029]  And we know from the Chinese example, the social credit score, where it's going.
[01:34:07.029 --> 01:34:09.591]  Bank accounts being de-platformed, banned.
[01:34:09.591 --> 01:34:12.193]  We've already had that in the US to some extent.
[01:34:12.193 --> 01:34:14.615]  Not being able to buy plane and train tickets.
[01:34:15.194 --> 01:34:16.194]  This is where it's going.
[01:34:16.194 --> 01:34:19.295]  It's going into a very dark direction.
[01:34:19.295 --> 01:34:24.516]  Laura, you're one of the primary victims of this social credit score USA tyranny.
[01:34:24.516 --> 01:34:42.519]  Despite your success with fundraising for this campaign, out fundraising the incumbent Democrat there in South Florida, just tell us briefly about, you know, some of the more personal life struggles and the psychological impact of being banned by all these different companies, by all these different platforms.
[01:34:44.105 --> 01:34:47.687]  Yeah, it's a really good question and something that nobody really talks about.
[01:34:47.687 --> 01:34:50.868]  And look, I'm not going to lie and pretend like it's been easy.
[01:34:50.868 --> 01:34:52.149]  It's been really hard.
[01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:58.892]  And you of all people know, I mean, when I got banned, the day I got banned, I came on InfoWars and everybody saw me crying.
[01:34:59.412 --> 01:35:08.894]  And just like you were talking beforehand, the left that likes to talk about helping people and how you shouldn't bully people online and how bad it is for mental health, what did they do?
[01:35:08.894 --> 01:35:12.335]  They plastered that interview and they mocked me until it went viral.
[01:35:12.335 --> 01:35:17.436]  And the Young Turks were showing me on screen crying because my bank shut me down too.
[01:35:17.436 --> 01:35:22.517]  I mean, to the point where, you know, I can't even get a cab or anything.
[01:35:22.517 --> 01:35:23.617]  And they're trying to mock me.
[01:35:23.677 --> 01:35:24.237]  We're good to go.
[01:35:54.184 --> 01:35:56.968]  When they shut me off, I wasn't able to communicate with them.
[01:35:56.968 --> 01:35:59.552]  It cut off my ability to communicate with my family.
[01:35:59.552 --> 01:36:06.261]  I was communicating with some of my family members on Facebook and, you know, it makes you feel very lonely.
[01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:10.267]  And for a time, I did feel very down and depressed about it.
[01:36:10.928 --> 01:36:15.870]  You know, you can't just wallow in sadness and you can't allow them to win and that's what they want.
[01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:27.155]  They want you to feel so helpless and alone and that's why they shut people off because they hope that they can ban you and silence you and make you go crazy or think that you're alone to the point where you just give up.
[01:36:27.735 --> 01:36:32.442]  And yeah, like I said, it's definitely hard some days and I feel really lonely most of the time.
[01:36:32.442 --> 01:36:41.175]  But I know that not many people would be able to do what I'm doing and it takes a special kind of person who is able to handle a lot.
[01:36:41.175 --> 01:36:43.578]  And I know that this is my struggle.
[01:36:44.577 --> 01:36:45.538]  We're good to go.
[01:37:06.232 --> 01:37:09.253]  I'm gonna win, and I'm gonna fight for all Americans, right?
[01:37:09.253 --> 01:37:10.914]  Not just the people here in District 21.
[01:37:10.914 --> 01:37:12.555]  I'm fighting for everybody.
[01:37:12.555 --> 01:37:25.801]  And that's one of the main reasons why I decided to run for Congress, too, is because when I was banned and when Chase Banks shut down my online account, I contacted my representative, who is Lois Frankel, and I asked her for help, and she wouldn't help me.
[01:37:25.801 --> 01:37:33.745]  And here I am, I had millions of followers, and nobody has helped me, nobody has helped Alex Jones, and we're international figures, right?
[01:37:33.745 --> 01:37:34.165]  And I thought,
[01:37:34.801 --> 01:37:38.985]  What on earth would the average American do if what has happened to me has happened to them?
[01:37:38.985 --> 01:37:43.109]  And so I don't want what has happened to me to happen to anybody else here.
[01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:50.797]  I don't want what has happened to you or Alex Jones or Gavin McGinnis or Tommy Robinson and Milo Yiannopoulos to happen to anybody else.
[01:37:50.797 --> 01:37:51.678]  Not here.
[01:37:51.678 --> 01:37:52.519]  Not in the UK.
[01:37:52.519 --> 01:37:53.700]  Not in Hong Kong.
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:54.421]  Nowhere.
[01:37:54.421 --> 01:37:56.463]  And so I'm running to make sure that
[01:37:57.143 --> 01:37:57.903]  We're good to go.
[01:38:21.491 --> 01:38:23.433]  The Communist Chinese.
[01:38:23.433 --> 01:38:27.016]  And so that's what keeps me going on the days when I feel really down and out.
[01:38:27.016 --> 01:38:43.130]  That's what keeps me going on days when I feel kind of sad about being banned and shut down is that there are people all around the world in worse situations than mine who are hoping that I pull through so that they can too.
[01:38:44.861 --> 01:38:45.742]  Inspiring stuff!
[01:38:45.742 --> 01:38:47.003]  Laura Loomer going to leave it there.
[01:38:47.003 --> 01:38:48.704]  Lauraloomer4Congress.com.
[01:38:48.704 --> 01:38:50.365]  Go there, donate to Laura's campaign.
[01:38:50.365 --> 01:38:52.867]  Absolutely amazing efforts with the fundraising.
[01:38:52.867 --> 01:38:56.309]  Go and support Laura Loomer for Congress at that website.
[01:38:56.309 --> 01:38:57.210]  We're going to wrap it up there.
[01:38:57.210 --> 01:38:59.491]  Thanks for joining us, Laura Loomer.
[01:38:59.491 --> 01:38:59.831]  Thanks.
[01:38:59.831 --> 01:39:01.553]  Thanks for having me.
[01:39:01.553 --> 01:39:05.876]  We're going to go straight to a clip now from Alex Jones, the AJ Iodine conspiracy.
[01:39:05.876 --> 01:39:07.817]  Here is the clip.
[01:39:07.817 --> 01:39:10.399]  It is fulfilling to be informed.
[01:39:10.399 --> 01:39:13.061]  It is fulfilling to know there are serious challenges
[01:39:14.255 --> 01:39:18.158]  Our individual lives and to our species in general.
[01:39:18.158 --> 01:39:29.546]  It's fulfilling to face the hard facts because we are designed to take on a challenge when we decide to actually engage and be involved and have purpose-driven lives.
[01:39:29.546 --> 01:39:39.093]  So many people are completely empty no matter how much money or how much success they have because they did it only for themselves not for
[01:39:39.813 --> 01:39:41.934]  The greater connectivity.
[01:39:41.934 --> 01:39:43.595]  Now the globalists understand this.
[01:39:43.595 --> 01:39:47.018]  The social engineers know how we tick.
[01:39:47.018 --> 01:39:58.124]  And so they will create an artificial system of collectivism where a centralized corporate board collectivizes us for the so-called good of the people.
[01:39:58.124 --> 01:40:05.109]  But really we're being collectivized so we can be controlled and engineered and further dumbed down and turned into slaves.
[01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:06.790]  That's the admitted globalist program.
[01:40:08.243 --> 01:40:15.412]  So I like to pull back and look at things that are really hard to change versus things that are really easy to change.
[01:40:15.412 --> 01:40:23.222]  And InfoWars has been instrumental, thanks to your support, in launching major initiatives against the anti-human forces of the NWO.
[01:40:24.946 --> 01:40:34.153]  That said though, electromagnetic radiation from 5G, what they're doing to us through the vaccines, all of this is a real challenge.
[01:40:34.153 --> 01:40:43.359]  The brainwashing of our children, the sexualization of our children, all of this is done to sabotage the species so we don't go to the next level.
[01:40:43.359 --> 01:40:47.723]  But one of the ways we can really, really take action is with
[01:40:48.855 --> 01:40:53.256]  Things that our bodies absolutely have to have to live and survive.
[01:40:53.256 --> 01:41:09.321]  And these are things that the globalists have very quietly, but in a steady way, focused on to make sure that we don't get them in our diets so that we are dumb, so that we are slow, so that we are lethargic, so that we don't have that initiative.
[01:41:09.321 --> 01:41:18.583]  Because if we have the initiative, well, then we will make choices in our lives and be involved in ways that take control away from the control freak social engineer.
[01:41:18.903 --> 01:41:22.268]  Globalists, the mad scientists, that think they're God.
[01:41:22.268 --> 01:41:26.393]  Now that said, this is how we fund our operation.
[01:41:26.393 --> 01:41:31.881]  And I fund our operation with things that I believe in, that I know are good, and that I use.
[01:41:31.881 --> 01:41:33.523]  And I cannot tell you enough.
[01:41:34.853 --> 01:41:40.980]  How important it is to realize that almost all the soils on the planet are depleted of iodine.
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:44.484]  If you don't have iodine, you will get deficiencies, you will end up dying.
[01:41:44.484 --> 01:41:45.806]  That's a fact.
[01:41:45.806 --> 01:41:52.173]  And there's all the big studies, Europe, US, China, Mexico, there's thousands of them, that iodine deficiency causes
[01:41:52.734 --> 01:41:53.395]  We're good to go.
[01:42:11.329 --> 01:42:13.351]  We are getting stupider and stupider.
[01:42:13.351 --> 01:42:14.973]  Our IQs are plunging.
[01:42:14.973 --> 01:42:27.464]  And ladies and gentlemen, this is being done by the cold-blooded establishment to create a system where the West falls and then there'll be nobody to oppose their authoritarianism because all the other nations accept it.
[01:42:27.464 --> 01:42:31.448]  They never had the revolutions that we had in America and areas of England and Europe.
[01:42:31.448 --> 01:42:32.830]  And so it's a big deal.
[01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:36.073]  So I want to just encourage you to understand this isn't just some pitch to fund InfoWars.
[01:42:37.148 --> 01:42:40.911]  We have the Iodine Challenge at MFORESTORE.COM.
[01:42:40.911 --> 01:42:44.853]  X2 and X3 and Biotrue Selenium, the very best out there.
[01:42:44.853 --> 01:42:46.854]  It goes very well with the iodine.
[01:42:46.854 --> 01:42:49.937]  To supercharge the electrochemical activities in your body.
[01:42:49.937 --> 01:42:52.238]  Your body makes hormones off of iodine.
[01:42:52.238 --> 01:42:53.239]  It's just incredible.
[01:42:53.239 --> 01:42:56.701]  And find out what the good halogen does versus the bad halogen.
[01:42:56.701 --> 01:42:58.822]  Go to MFORESTORE.COM.
[01:42:58.822 --> 01:43:01.044]  60% off on the Iodine Global Challenge.
[01:43:01.044 --> 01:43:06.668]  And please tell others about this information and give them the facts because this is key to stopping the globalist agenda.
[01:43:07.769 --> 01:43:09.510]  Hello, here.
[01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:11.492]  My name is Bethelme.
[01:43:11.492 --> 01:43:14.475]  I work for my father, Lucifer.
[01:43:14.475 --> 01:43:23.964]  He doesn't like the fact that God gave you all families and children, and so... We want to tell you something right now, Christian countries.
[01:43:23.964 --> 01:43:26.386]  We took control of you over a hundred years ago.
[01:43:26.386 --> 01:43:31.410]  We've been spiking your water with fluoride to lower your fertility and to hurt you.
[01:43:32.331 --> 01:43:43.725]  It's worked so well, but now because of liability, and because of people warning inside the government what's happening, the Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done.
[01:43:43.725 --> 01:43:49.832]  And it makes me so angry, so whatever you do, just stay in that haze, and drink fluoride and give it to your children.
[01:43:52.069 --> 01:44:01.625]  And go visit InfoWarsTore.com and learn about the Island Conspiracy and get 60% off on X2 and X3 together with BioCrew Selenium from the mustard seed.
[01:44:01.625 --> 01:44:04.149]  Submit to us.

[01:44:06.581 --> 01:44:08.601]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[01:44:08.601 --> 01:44:11.482]  I'm Wilbur Snakeland.
[01:44:11.482 --> 01:44:33.166]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro to the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[01:44:34.226 --> 01:44:46.172]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad.
[01:44:46.172 --> 01:44:49.514]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[01:44:49.514 --> 01:44:50.715]  There's no medical journals.
[01:44:50.715 --> 01:44:52.195]  There's no facts.
[01:44:52.195 --> 01:44:53.656]  You need fluoride.
[01:44:53.656 --> 01:45:02.481]  Just drink extra fluoride and then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[01:45:06.382 --> 01:45:18.327]  Hello today on All Things Considered, I'm Wilbur Snakely here to tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[01:45:18.327 --> 01:45:22.129]  Now sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that
[01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:28.392]  It's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[01:45:28.392 --> 01:45:31.174]  That's right, drink the fluoride.
[01:45:31.174 --> 01:45:36.977]  Don't visit infowarestore.com and get the good halogen, I mean the bad halogen.
[01:45:36.977 --> 01:45:40.459]  Iodine, don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[01:45:41.219 --> 01:45:47.664]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us.
[01:45:47.664 --> 01:45:49.325]  We don't want to compete with you.
[01:45:49.325 --> 01:45:51.987]  Just drink the fluoride.
[01:45:51.987 --> 01:45:55.749]  Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do.
[01:45:55.749 --> 01:45:57.911]  Don't support Alex Jones.
[01:45:57.911 --> 01:46:02.334]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal.
[01:46:02.334 --> 01:46:04.475]  Oh, and let Nambla have access to your children.
[01:46:06.687 --> 01:46:12.233]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[01:46:12.233 --> 01:46:15.257]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[01:46:15.257 --> 01:46:19.682]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[01:46:19.682 --> 01:46:26.290]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:32.756]  They might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[01:46:32.756 --> 01:46:38.121]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[01:46:38.121 --> 01:46:45.708]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[01:46:45.908 --> 01:46:46.788]  It's that simple.
[01:46:46.788 --> 01:46:52.990]  Find out about the Iodine Conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com and find out why the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:56.790]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research Iodine Deficiency.
[01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:58.731]  It's the key to everything.
[01:46:58.731 --> 01:47:10.193]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality Iodine and BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:47:10.193 --> 01:47:12.814]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.036 --> 01:47:25.257]  You found it!
[01:47:25.257 --> 01:47:27.318]  The tip of the spear!
[01:47:27.318 --> 01:47:30.320]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:36.083]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson!
[01:47:36.083 --> 01:47:45.829]  Well, the media and progressives have banged on all day about mental health awareness, well, and cyberbullying, while literally cyberbullying people on the internet if they're on the political right.
[01:47:45.829 --> 01:47:48.631]  We saw a case with Jordan Peterson yesterday
[01:47:49.409 --> 01:47:51.990]  He appeared in a news interview obviously very upset.
[01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.850]  He was crying.
[01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:57.572]  He's been through a lot of personal turmoil over the last few months with his wife nearly dying.
[01:47:57.572 --> 01:48:01.634]  He cries during an interview and he wasn't like roaring crying.
[01:48:01.634 --> 01:48:06.096]  He just had tears rolling down his cheeks and they absolutely crucified him.
[01:48:06.096 --> 01:48:08.597]  It's like Laura was saying in the previous segment.
[01:48:08.597 --> 01:48:14.419]  Anyone who betrays any emotional vulnerability on the right is immediately viciously mob attacked.
[01:48:14.972 --> 01:48:20.337]  By the same people who virtue signal all day about how much they care about mental health awareness.
[01:48:20.337 --> 01:48:26.243]  Unless you have a different opinion to them politically, then they will viciously attack you like nothing else.
[01:48:26.243 --> 01:48:31.628]  So we've got this entire narrative about people need to talk about their feelings more.
[01:48:31.628 --> 01:48:34.851]  When anyone does on the right, they're crucified.
[01:48:34.851 --> 01:48:35.232]  But again,
[01:48:35.942 --> 01:48:39.144]  They say there's a stigma around talking about depression.
[01:48:39.144 --> 01:48:46.509]  There is no stigma talking about it so long as you separate it from politics and suddenly there is for some reason.
[01:48:46.509 --> 01:48:53.873]  But what they're not talking about is social media and what impact social media addiction has on mental health and depression.
[01:48:53.873 --> 01:48:59.717]  And that is studied, that is considered in this article out of the Daily Caller which is also up on InfoWars.com.
[01:49:00.772 --> 01:49:08.059]  Experts explain possible reasons behind a 56% jump in youth suicide rate in 10 years.
[01:49:08.059 --> 01:49:09.220]  Listen to these stats.
[01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:17.788]  The national youth suicide rate in the US has increased 56% in 10 years according to data from the CDC.
[01:49:19.204 --> 01:49:29.308]  This is from 2007 to 2017, just by coincidence, the same time period when social media skyrocketed.
[01:49:29.308 --> 01:49:32.309]  Social media use skyrocketed.
[01:49:32.309 --> 01:49:37.331]  The suicide rate among young people ages 10 to 24 increased from 6.8 per 100,000 people in 2007 to 10.6 per 100,000 people in 2017.
[01:49:37.331 --> 01:49:39.852]  Get this, among youth ages 10 to 14, the suicide rate nearly tripled
[01:49:49.355 --> 01:50:03.623]  From 2007 to 2017, for all age groups between 10 and 24 years old, studied by the CDC, suicide rates surpassed homicide rates from 2011 to 2017, the report notes.
[01:50:03.623 --> 01:50:08.685]  Additionally, the suicide rate in the US in general has increased 30%.
[01:50:08.685 --> 01:50:15.269]  The chances of a person in this age range dying by suicide is greater than homicide, when it used to be the reverse.
[01:50:16.198 --> 01:50:20.942]  They talk about antidepressant use in this article, but they also talk about social media.
[01:50:20.942 --> 01:50:21.863]  It's a long article.
[01:50:21.863 --> 01:50:23.925]  I'm not going to go through it all.
[01:50:23.925 --> 01:50:30.011]  But they make the point that a Pew Research Center study found 86% of adults between the ages of 18 and 24 use some form of social media.
[01:50:30.011 --> 01:50:32.113]  95% of children ages 13 through 17 have a smartphone.
[01:50:38.783 --> 01:50:47.412]  So that boom started after Facebook was invented in 2004 and then of course you had Twitter, you had Instagram after that.
[01:50:47.412 --> 01:50:50.235]  Just three years before the beginning of the CDC study.
[01:50:50.235 --> 01:50:56.922]  The same year the first iPhone was released and the FDA applied the black box label to antidepressant medications for children.
[01:50:58.846 --> 01:51:00.167]  Now this is what an expert says.
[01:51:00.167 --> 01:51:01.969]  Certainly the timing is impressive.
[01:51:01.969 --> 01:51:08.034]  The invention of the iPhone, Facebook and the withdrawal of antidepressants as a mainstream intervention by pediatricians.
[01:51:08.034 --> 01:51:11.317]  These are all correlations.
[01:51:11.317 --> 01:51:15.601]  Another expert said, I think we're going to reflect on this time and think, what were we thinking?
[01:51:15.601 --> 01:51:23.548]  When a child between the ages of 6 and 16 has a computer powerful enough to run a small country, they can end up with serious issues.
[01:51:23.548 --> 01:51:25.050]  And again, it goes back to this point.
[01:51:26.036 --> 01:51:45.870]  If you're a naturally lonely person who feels ostracized, atomized by society, and you're sat there on your computer, on Facebook, on Snapchat, on Instagram, seeing what all your contemporaries, what your peers are doing, seeing that they're all having fun, they're all at the parties, that is only going to drag you down further.
[01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:52.495]  There is a direct correlation between social media use, social media addiction, and depression, and eventually suicide, because again,
[01:51:53.075 --> 01:52:03.784]  People are seeing the feeds, the social media feeds of their friends and of their acquaintances and not realizing that it's a highlights reel and in many cases it's manipulated.
[01:52:03.784 --> 01:52:06.266]  They're not having extravagant fun lives.
[01:52:06.266 --> 01:52:12.752]  They're just having these individual moments which seem like it's their entire existence when it's not.
[01:52:12.752 --> 01:52:20.358]  In many cases the same people posting those images, those videos are just as lonely as the other people sitting at home viewing them
[01:52:21.098 --> 01:52:23.662]  I'm wondering why they didn't get invited to the party.
[01:52:23.662 --> 01:52:27.349]  So it's all a massive negative feedback loop.
[01:52:27.349 --> 01:52:30.875]  The media will not talk about this connection to any great degree.
[01:52:31.624 --> 01:52:38.448]  They'll only talk about other factors which may or may not even be as directly related.
[01:52:38.448 --> 01:52:49.094]  Because again, as Laura was saying in the interview, most of these leftists, these progressives, live on Twitter and they do not want to see it condemned or criticised in any way.
[01:52:49.094 --> 01:52:52.136]  That is a long article but it's really worth a read.
[01:52:52.136 --> 01:52:58.120]  About the 56% jump in youth suicide rate in 10 years, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:52:58.120 --> 01:52:58.540]  Meanwhile,
[01:52:59.423 --> 01:53:07.547]  Justin Trudeau, Canada's first black president, wants to censor the internet if he wins re-election, which of course he did last night.
[01:53:07.547 --> 01:53:12.990]  Not with a majority government, with a minority government, but he's still back in power.
[01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:23.575]  That's right, the world's number one blackface enthusiast will decide what constitutes, quote, harmful content in a bid to tackle online hate and disinformation.
[01:53:23.575 --> 01:53:27.357]  Unless it's hatred against Jordan Peterson for crying in a video, then it's perfectly fine.
[01:53:28.439 --> 01:53:33.463]  So they were asked a question, Trudeau's Liberal Party, which is now back in power.
[01:53:33.463 --> 01:53:39.887]  Does your party support the development of a national strategy to combat online hate and disinformation?
[01:53:39.887 --> 01:53:40.727]  They said yes.
[01:53:40.727 --> 01:53:47.792]  They will start fining social media companies if they don't remove, quote, hate speech within 24 hours.
[01:53:47.792 --> 01:53:52.916]  If they don't do that, they will face massive financial penalties.
[01:53:52.916 --> 01:53:57.419]  As I point out in this article, according to progressives, hate speech is anything that contradicts their dogma.
[01:53:58.010 --> 01:54:05.775]  Giving Trudeau the power to censor such content is a trapdoor to the widespread evisceration of free speech online.
[01:54:05.775 --> 01:54:10.477]  Mark Stein said, ultimately, free speech is hate speech and hate speech is free speech.
[01:54:10.477 --> 01:54:13.279]  It's for the speech you hate, the speech you revile.
[01:54:13.279 --> 01:54:14.600]  And that is the exact point.
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:19.663]  If you don't defend the speech of the most vile people imaginable, you don't defend free speech at all.
[01:54:20.307 --> 01:54:23.809]  He continues, the alternative to free speech is approved speech.
[01:54:23.809 --> 01:54:27.471]  And that necessarily means approved by whom?
[01:54:27.471 --> 01:54:32.634]  Well, in this case, it is the world's number one blackface enthusiast, Justin Trudeau.
[01:54:32.634 --> 01:54:37.556]  He is going to decide what is hateful, at least in Canada.
[01:54:37.556 --> 01:54:44.060]  Meanwhile, on the subject of free speech, Nick Cave slams woke culture as an assault on free speech.
[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:45.921]  This is the music icon, Nick Cave.
[01:54:46.997 --> 01:54:55.979]  Who has slammed woke culture as an assault on free speech, asserting that it's self-righteous and inflicts suppression on contrary systems of thought.
[01:54:55.979 --> 01:55:00.679]  So yet again, this is another successful, famous celebrity.
[01:55:00.679 --> 01:55:08.581]  The only ones who speak out, the only ones who are immune to cancel culture, are the people who have already had their success.
[01:55:08.581 --> 01:55:15.042]  The people who are so big, so revered, so well-loved, that they can't be toppled by cancel culture.
[01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:17.731]  They feel free to speak out.
[01:55:17.731 --> 01:55:32.488]  Isn't the case of course for the vast majority of celebrities who are coming up and are absolutely petrified of offending woke mobs who then get them cancelled on the internet for transgressing the boundaries of political correctness.
[01:55:32.488 --> 01:55:33.549]  Nick Cave said quote
[01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:49.925]  Some of us are of the generation that believed that free speech was a clear-cut and uncontested virtue, yet within a generation this concept is seen by many as a dog whistle to the far right and is rapidly being consigned to the left's ever-expanding ideological junk pile.
[01:55:49.925 --> 01:55:55.207]  He also made some other comments in that article, which I encourage you to read.
[01:55:55.207 --> 01:56:00.289]  Meanwhile, Kanye West says rap is the devil's music.
[01:56:00.289 --> 01:56:03.270]  Of course, Kanye West recently converted to Christianity,
[01:56:04.272 --> 01:56:15.643]  He told his pastor, Adam Tyson, that he wasn't going to rap anymore because, quote, according to the pastor, Kanye told him, that's the devil's music.
[01:56:15.643 --> 01:56:18.125]  He then convinced him that he could use his talents for God.
[01:56:18.125 --> 01:56:20.007]  He could rap for God instead.
[01:56:20.007 --> 01:56:26.834]  Yeezy also confided in him that the fame had exacerbated his problems with sinful behavior.
[01:56:27.679 --> 01:56:30.080]  He said, quote, the guilt of sin brought him down low.
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:35.881]  He would say the devil basically brought him to a place where he just felt like he was in bondage to his sin.
[01:56:35.881 --> 01:56:38.962]  So he said, I got delivered.
[01:56:38.962 --> 01:56:44.323]  Is there any reason why they hate Kanye West so much?
[01:56:44.323 --> 01:56:48.164]  Chinese Communist Party says criticizing LeBron James is racist.
[01:56:48.164 --> 01:56:51.025]  You knew that was going to happen.
[01:56:51.025 --> 01:56:55.286]  Of course, he denounced Rockets, Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey.
[01:56:56.004 --> 01:56:56.184]  I think?
[01:57:14.918 --> 01:57:15.599]  We're good to go.
[01:57:32.122 --> 01:57:40.827]  That wrote an editorial saying that LeBron James' detractors were using quote, nasty racial connotations to attack him.
[01:57:40.827 --> 01:57:44.630]  Yes, this is one of the biggest human rights abusers on the planet.
[01:57:44.630 --> 01:57:52.075]  A country that literally puts Muslims in concentration camps lecturing people on being bigoted and racist.
[01:57:52.075 --> 01:57:52.575]  Incredible.
[01:57:53.295 --> 01:57:54.016]  InfoWars.com.
[01:57:54.016 --> 01:57:55.577]  We'll be back in the next segment.
[01:57:55.577 --> 01:57:56.238]  Don't go away.
[01:57:56.238 --> 01:57:59.801]  InfoWars presents Alex Jones.
[01:57:59.801 --> 01:58:15.075]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious, came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies die in the womb, and it causes cancer.
[01:58:15.075 --> 01:58:17.698]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[01:58:18.138 --> 01:58:25.020]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:33.621]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children.
[01:58:33.621 --> 01:58:39.803]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:40.603 --> 01:58:42.586]  Fluoride and die!
[01:58:42.586 --> 01:58:45.911]  Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over!
[01:58:45.911 --> 01:58:49.455]  Do not visit InfoWarsTore.com and get high-quality iodine to counter it.
[01:58:49.455 --> 01:58:49.776]  No!
[01:58:49.776 --> 01:58:51.739]  Roll over and die, dirty Americans!
[01:58:57.478 --> 01:59:01.624]  You probably never heard of preglanone, but you need to learn about it, believe me.
[01:59:01.624 --> 01:59:11.256]  As we age, preglanone levels decrease with age inside the body as much as 60% between the ages of 20 and 75, making you tired and lazy.
[01:59:11.256 --> 01:59:12.158]  This is a missing link.
[01:59:12.398 --> 01:59:25.162]  With the Real Red Pill formula and Real Red Pill Plus that has added energy, you can defy that test of time and keep your pergolinone up for hormone balance, healthy aging, and optimal cognitive function daily.
[01:59:25.162 --> 01:59:30.884]  Believe me, folks, all of our information is game-changing, but Real Red Pill and Red Pill Plus are incredible.
[01:59:30.884 --> 01:59:36.345]  They're both available right now, even though they're fan favorites, at InfoWarsTore.com for 50% off.
[01:59:36.345 --> 01:59:37.046]  This is an
[01:59:38.266 --> 01:59:41.088]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:16.528 --> 02:00:27.410]  Medical Progress is fighting an uphill battle after they exposed Planned Parenthood's trafficking of the hearts, brains, lungs, livers, and limbs of developing infants.
[02:00:27.410 --> 02:00:36.472]  In graphic detail, Planned Parenthood's Senior Director of Medical Services described how to preserve valuable fetal tissue during an abortion.
[02:00:36.472 --> 02:00:41.773]  We've been very good at getting parts off of our fetus because we know that we, so I'm not going to crush that part.
[02:00:41.773 --> 02:00:46.094]  I'm going to basically crush below, I'm going to crush above, and I'm going to sort of get it all intact.
[02:00:46.553 --> 02:00:56.876]  Following in the footsteps of Kamala Harris, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is dangling 15 felony counts against CMP's David Daleiden.
[02:00:56.876 --> 02:01:05.518]  And the corporate monstrosity also launched a $7 million racketeering lawsuit against Daleiden and the investigators that aided him.
[02:01:05.518 --> 02:01:10.679]  Daleiden is charged with tampering with a government document and offering to buy human body parts.
[02:01:11.279 --> 02:01:17.686]  One a felony, the other a misdemeanor charge that on conviction carried punishment of up to 20 years behind bars.
[02:01:17.686 --> 02:01:20.970]  His attorneys say they'll ask to have those charges thrown out.
[02:01:20.970 --> 02:01:30.681]  The sworn testimony that is now coming out where they admit that the videos are true and admit that they've been harvesting and selling baby body parts for money for years.
[02:01:31.241 --> 02:01:43.226]  That's all coming out documented and sworn under oath as evidence and testimony in the courtroom and I think that's going to have serious repercussions for Planned Parenthood and their business partners as this process continues.
[02:01:43.226 --> 02:01:45.747]  Planned Parenthood is a strange animal.
[02:01:45.747 --> 02:01:49.109]  A hybrid of a political network and a network of healthcare.
[02:01:49.229 --> 02:02:04.637]  But as testimony during the CMP versus Planned Parenthood trial reveals, Planned Parenthood is nothing short of a corporatic sacrificial temple with FedEx trucks trucking out baby parts as if Planned Parenthood was simply a grocery store butcher.
[02:02:04.637 --> 02:02:12.421]  As CMP board member Alvin Romberg revealed, in some cases, the people noticed that the parts went out before the mother went out.
[02:02:12.421 --> 02:02:18.404]  She would come staggering out later, typically throwing up in the bushes and being helped out of the place.
[02:02:18.724 --> 02:02:30.350]  After the baby parts had already gone into the FedEx truck, Romberg then dropped a gruesome bombshell, testifying, We realized that one, for example, was a research being done on baldness.
[02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:44.077]  They were scalping the babies and taking their scalps and grafting them onto immune-suppressed mice, and then using various pharmaceuticals on these humanized mice to test the effect upon preventing, or I suppose you might say,
[02:02:44.617 --> 02:02:45.978]  Treating Baldness.
[02:02:45.978 --> 02:02:54.263]  As Town Hall reported, Planned Parenthood violently ends the lives of more than 332,000 unborn children every year.
[02:02:54.263 --> 02:02:59.846]  Their health care offerings have long been declining, yet their financials have never looked better.
[02:02:59.846 --> 02:03:04.829]  Something to keep in mind when they cry poor over the Title X funds they chose to forego.
[02:03:05.089 --> 02:03:08.392]  During fiscal year 2017 to 2018, they reported a record income of $1.67 billion with $244.8 million in excess revenue.
[02:03:08.392 --> 02:03:11.494]  $563.8 million of that revenue, or more than $1.5 million per day, came from the American taxpayer.
[02:03:26.246 --> 02:03:48.381]  Not to mention, George Soros has flooded the coffers of Planned Parenthood with approximately $30 million, and Soros recently launched a political action committee that has given Planned Parenthood Virginia its record largest outside contribution of $350,000, according to the Virginia Public Access Project's website.
[02:03:48.381 --> 02:03:56.186]  On top of their mounting legal costs, CMP faces a biased Judge Orrick, whose ties to Planned Parenthood are well known.
[02:03:56.186 --> 02:03:59.887]  The trial between CMP and Planned Parenthood will wrap up sometime in early November.
[02:04:26.224 --> 02:04:31.568]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:04:31.568 --> 02:04:46.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, when we get back from this short break, we will be joined by Alex Jones with the latest breaking news, as always.
[02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:48.422]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:48.422 --> 02:04:50.283]  Owen Troyer now in the driver's seat.
[02:04:50.283 --> 02:04:51.725]  Alex Jones coming up.
[02:04:51.725 --> 02:04:53.086]  Mike Adams coming up.
[02:04:53.086 --> 02:04:54.267]  Carpe Doctum coming up.
[02:04:55.031 --> 02:04:56.355]  Maybe a couple of your phone calls, too.
[02:04:56.355 --> 02:04:57.478]  We'll see what happens.
[02:04:57.478 --> 02:04:59.845]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:04:59.845 --> 02:05:01.831]  Unless it's Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:05.424 --> 02:05:07.444]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[02:05:07.444 --> 02:05:10.325]  I'm Wilbur Snakeland.
[02:05:10.325 --> 02:05:32.029]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro to the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[02:05:33.070 --> 02:05:45.022]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad.
[02:05:45.022 --> 02:05:48.366]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[02:05:48.366 --> 02:05:49.567]  There's no medical journals.
[02:05:49.567 --> 02:05:51.069]  There's no facts.
[02:05:51.069 --> 02:05:52.510]  You need fluoride.
[02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:54.092]  Just drink extra fluoride.
[02:05:55.113 --> 02:06:01.298]  And then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:36.665]  In 2014, 40 defendants in the Eastern District of California have received sentences of 15 years to life for crimes against children.
[02:06:36.665 --> 02:06:41.928]  16 have received sentences of 25 years to life for crimes against children.
[02:06:41.928 --> 02:06:45.250]  These are the worst of the worst.
[02:06:45.250 --> 02:06:54.274]  This morning, Judge John Mendez of the Eastern District Court here in Sacramento sentenced Michael Clemens to life.
[02:06:55.478 --> 02:07:11.447]  We are very proud to add Mr. Clemens to the totals that I just described through the investigation, prosecution, conviction, and sentencing of him of some of the most egregious conduct imaginable.
[02:07:11.447 --> 02:07:24.094]  Specifically, Clemens pled guilty prior to trial to conspiracy to produce child pornography, attempted production and production of child pornography, and receipt of child pornography.
[02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:31.312]  He then went to trial before a jury on three remaining counts in the indictment.
[02:07:31.312 --> 02:07:43.035]  And that jury, after hearing all the evidence and the laws provided by Judge Mendez, found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of these three crimes.
[02:07:43.035 --> 02:07:46.436]  The buying of children for sexual purposes.
[02:07:46.436 --> 02:07:48.196]  Let me say that again.
[02:07:48.196 --> 02:07:52.558]  The buying of children for sexual purposes.
[02:07:52.558 --> 02:07:54.078]  Travel and attempted travel.
[02:07:54.625 --> 02:08:04.568]  With intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct and conspiracy to travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct.
[02:08:04.568 --> 02:08:12.570]  The only way to ensure for all time that Clemens could not harm any more young girls was a life sentence.
[02:08:13.777 --> 02:08:27.721]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with a shocking report for you on serious discrimination and human rights violations that are going on here in the United States that are just stunning.
[02:08:27.721 --> 02:08:35.603]  Now, again, these violations aren't what's happening in Sudan or Somalia or the recently liberated by Hillary, Libya.
[02:08:36.443 --> 02:08:45.714]  Where hundreds of thousands of women have been kidnapped and put into sex slavery and where blacks are seen as subhuman by the Arabs and sold into slavery as well.
[02:08:45.714 --> 02:08:53.403]  That's mainstream news, but if you talk about it on Twitter, you get banned because any criticism of the wondrous Islam is wrong.
[02:08:54.438 --> 02:08:54.718]  I agree.
[02:09:16.215 --> 02:09:26.520]  Jack Dorsey to know that I agree with his defense of the satanic verses as well, and Salman Rushdie, and that I'm ready to embrace Islam.
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:31.403]  Now, I digress folks, I want to get back to the live show here.
[02:09:31.403 --> 02:09:35.445]  The main reason I called is extreme, extreme discrimination.
[02:09:37.009 --> 02:09:37.309]  I think?
[02:09:50.106 --> 02:09:55.208]  Where you have convicted pedophiles, and that's a discriminatory term according to the left, and I agree with them.
[02:09:55.208 --> 02:10:13.156]  You have these pedophiles, ladies and gentlemen, who are convicted pedophiles, and they are there with the children at the events, and now some of these evil discriminators want to do background checks, ladies and gentlemen, before children sit on their laps and quote, ride horsey.
[02:10:14.196 --> 02:10:26.446]  In fact, there was even a local Wichita, Kansas paper that they're saying it's discriminatory to try to do backgrounds at the schools and libraries when these men dressed as women in big clown outfits come to touch their children.
[02:10:26.446 --> 02:10:35.254]  I mean, think of the just extremism and bizarre evil of these right-wing extremists who say there's only two genders and also say that men can't have babies.
[02:10:36.821 --> 02:10:42.164]  That's also being taught in textbooks to young children now that, again, men can't have babies.
[02:10:42.164 --> 02:10:43.624]  And I totally agree with that.
[02:10:43.624 --> 02:10:47.466]  Also, water can be lit on fire and grass is not green.
[02:10:47.466 --> 02:10:50.308]  But listen, let me get serious here.
[02:10:50.308 --> 02:11:05.776]  The real discrimination that's going on is part of this larger, giant pedophile sting and arrest that just happened all over the world with hundreds and hundreds of children being saved who were actually in the dungeon pits.
[02:11:06.556 --> 02:11:14.700]  Well, you see, they were being enlightened and educated and shown something new and shown some new culture when they were grabbed out of their parents' backyard and disappeared.
[02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:20.963]  That's what the moms say when they go to Drag Queen Storytime and have their kids ride horsey, in some cases on convicted pedophiles' laps.
[02:11:20.963 --> 02:11:23.725]  And that's why the story of Sacramento Bee is so important.
[02:11:23.725 --> 02:11:29.188]  This individual, reportedly, arrested for all this child porn, he worked at a, uh,
[02:11:30.817 --> 02:11:41.107]  Baby, a toddler school, a preschool, and he would run events where he would dress like a My Little Pony, and the little boys and girls would ride Pony.
[02:11:41.107 --> 02:11:42.568]  Well, isn't that interesting?
[02:11:42.568 --> 02:11:47.173]  Because at Drag Queen Storytime now, around the world, it's all run by Nambla, publicly.
[02:11:47.173 --> 02:11:49.876]  Another good organization, according to the left, which I agree with, of course.
[02:11:49.876 --> 02:11:50.736]  I don't want to be extreme.
[02:11:50.736 --> 02:11:54.140]  I don't want to be patted on the head by the thought police, who are good people.
[02:11:55.401 --> 02:11:57.283]  They now ride horsey.
[02:11:57.283 --> 02:12:00.707]  We can show you some photos of riding horsey.
[02:12:00.707 --> 02:12:11.538]  So you see, ladies and gentlemen, if a man comes up to you dressed like a clown or in a My Little Pony outfit at a park, well, by all means, show that you're not hateful and just turn your kids over to him.
[02:12:11.538 --> 02:12:15.562]  And again, if you see him grabbing your kid out of the back of the yard, as long as you're dressed like a big fat demon clown,
[02:12:16.403 --> 02:12:22.306]  As long as these high priests of satanism inducting children into torture... I'm sorry, excuse me.
[02:12:22.306 --> 02:12:24.267]  I was having a momentary lapse of hate.
[02:12:24.267 --> 02:12:26.007]  Excuse me, don't protect children.
[02:12:26.007 --> 02:12:27.228]  Abort them, kill them after they're born.
[02:12:27.228 --> 02:12:28.168]  Liberal, liberal, liberal.
[02:12:28.168 --> 02:12:29.229]  I now follow Obama.
[02:12:29.229 --> 02:12:30.289]  I now follow Hillary.
[02:12:30.289 --> 02:12:31.930]  Oh, he'll say to those... Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[02:12:32.410 --> 02:12:33.651]  Okay, back to being liberal and trendy.
[02:12:33.651 --> 02:12:35.913]  Back to being loving and a guardian of the children.
[02:12:35.913 --> 02:12:43.641]  As long as they're big fat men in clown outfits or in little horsey outfits, just when you're at the park, let your children ride horsey.
[02:12:43.641 --> 02:12:48.305]  And if you see them grabbing your child out of the backyard, it's a holy moment.
[02:12:48.305 --> 02:12:52.229]  It's a moment of man-boy love association.
[02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.849]  And just remember,
[02:12:53.650 --> 02:13:00.875]  In public schools from Australia to the U.S., they actually teach in the public schools and in the elementary schools.
[02:13:00.875 --> 02:13:08.440]  They have books in the library about children and sex capades with men that abuse them.
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:10.001]  Oh, it's so wonderful.
[02:13:10.001 --> 02:13:14.584]  Not dangerous at anything to have your child grabbed and taken to the back of a van or anything.
[02:13:17.006 --> 02:13:20.407]  So again, I believe in being fair and balanced.
[02:13:20.407 --> 02:13:32.093]  So more and more here on air, we're going to give equal time to the whole NPR leftist devil worshipper set and just kind of channel what they stand for and who they are.
[02:13:32.093 --> 02:13:34.114]  So listen to Greta Thunberg.
[02:13:35.354 --> 02:13:38.896]  And just turn off your power and die in the freezing dark.
[02:13:38.896 --> 02:13:43.539]  I mean, excuse me, drink fluoride.
[02:13:43.539 --> 02:13:44.079]  Die.
[02:13:44.079 --> 02:13:46.561]  And give us your children.
[02:13:46.561 --> 02:13:51.384]  Because the gates of hell have been opened and your planet is now ours.
[02:13:51.384 --> 02:13:53.745]  Nothing can stand against us.
[02:13:53.745 --> 02:13:55.026]  Give yourself to Hillary.
[02:13:58.831 --> 02:14:02.912]  Bring us to your children when we dress up like ponies.
[02:14:02.912 --> 02:14:04.973]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's how sick this has gotten.
[02:14:04.973 --> 02:14:06.313]  That's how evil this has gotten.
[02:14:06.313 --> 02:14:08.034]  But again, they hide it all in plain view.
[02:14:08.034 --> 02:14:09.514]  So you turn off your instincts.
[02:14:09.514 --> 02:14:14.696]  So you turn off your basic survival mechanism to protect your children.
[02:14:14.696 --> 02:14:18.097]  And then these monsters just come in and they're war on reality.
[02:14:18.097 --> 02:14:19.857]  And they're war on the family.
[02:14:19.857 --> 02:14:21.457]  And they're war on God.
[02:14:21.457 --> 02:14:24.258]  And the answer to this is loving Christ.
[02:14:24.258 --> 02:14:26.099]  And the answer is asking Christ into you.
[02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:30.602]  Because Christ totally trumps all of this.
[02:14:30.602 --> 02:14:33.884]  And it just comes down to the fact that there are no atheists in foxholes.
[02:14:33.884 --> 02:14:41.410]  And again, I'm not criticizing you if you are an atheist, but I'm just telling you, the enemy has an operating system, and it's Satanism, and we've got to have an operating system to counter it.
[02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:43.492]  And it's just getting worse and worse.
[02:14:43.492 --> 02:14:48.118]  There's a revolution of pedophiles and sickos who want to screw up children.
[02:14:48.118 --> 02:14:50.041]  They don't want to just have sex with them.
[02:14:50.041 --> 02:14:51.283]  They want to destroy their innocence.
[02:14:51.283 --> 02:14:52.925]  They want to take over their lives.
[02:14:52.925 --> 02:14:57.211]  And if you don't stand up to them, if you don't speak out against it, then you're signing on to it.
[02:14:58.192 --> 02:14:59.653]  And it is a satanic ritual.
[02:14:59.653 --> 02:15:00.873]  It is pure evil.
[02:15:00.873 --> 02:15:03.774]  All right, back to Owen Schroer, who's hosting in the next two hours.
[02:15:03.774 --> 02:15:07.456]  I'll be back in the office later, working on some big stories.
[02:15:07.456 --> 02:15:11.737]  And we've got so much more coming up as well here in the next few days.
[02:15:11.737 --> 02:15:15.679]  So please keep it locked to m4wars.com and newswars.com and band.video.
[02:15:15.679 --> 02:15:25.782]  And please don't get this report out to everybody you know, because these people, these men, these sickos, are literally wearing the disguise of women, clowns, and My Little Ponies when they come for your children.
[02:15:25.782 --> 02:15:26.863]  They're trying to make it trendy.
[02:15:27.885 --> 02:15:30.858]  To have you again lower your defenses and let them do it.
[02:15:30.858 --> 02:15:32.385]  It is absolutely an abomination.
[02:15:34.611 --> 02:15:41.876]  And folks, that is just one element of the abuse that the left and the Democrats put on children.
[02:15:41.876 --> 02:15:48.821]  There's also the psychological abuse with all the lies that they tell them, all the fear-mongering about the planet ending in 10 years.
[02:15:48.821 --> 02:16:02.370]  So, it really just goes to show you the psychosis and the sickness, the disease, that is modern-day liberalism, that they will go as far as to abuse children to make their political agenda complete.
[02:16:02.370 --> 02:16:03.150]  Really sick stuff.
[02:16:03.150 --> 02:16:03.731]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:04.471 --> 02:16:05.732]  Maybe not today.
[02:16:05.732 --> 02:16:07.013]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:16:07.013 --> 02:16:10.757]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:10.757 --> 02:16:11.837]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:11.837 --> 02:16:13.679]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:16:13.679 --> 02:16:15.380]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:23.187]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[02:16:23.187 --> 02:16:24.187]  Bold statement?
[02:16:24.187 --> 02:16:25.188]  You bet.
[02:16:25.188 --> 02:16:27.670]  See them now at survivalistcamps.com.
[02:16:27.670 --> 02:16:29.872]  That's survivalistcamps.com.
[02:16:29.872 --> 02:16:33.035]  Trust your family's survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[02:16:34.212 --> 02:16:35.433]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:35.433 --> 02:16:39.354]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:39.354 --> 02:16:40.895]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:40.895 --> 02:16:43.857]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:43.857 --> 02:16:49.419]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:49.419 --> 02:16:50.620]  I can help you, too.
[02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:53.541]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:16:53.541 --> 02:16:55.762]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:16:55.762 --> 02:17:00.204]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:17:00.204 --> 02:17:02.505]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:17:04.156 --> 02:17:06.117]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:17:06.117 --> 02:17:11.420]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:13.021]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:17:13.021 --> 02:17:21.366]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:17:21.366 --> 02:17:27.050]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:17:27.250 --> 02:17:29.052]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:17:29.052 --> 02:17:31.334]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:17:31.334 --> 02:17:35.738]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:17:35.738 --> 02:17:37.920]  I recommend Heart Body Extract to everyone.
[02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:45.648]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:17:45.808 --> 02:17:48.150]  Order your two month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.490]  That's 866-295-5305.
[02:17:48.490 --> 02:17:50.531]  Or order online at hbextract.com.
[02:17:50.531 --> 02:17:53.193]  Heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[02:18:05.234 --> 02:18:16.424]  Again, I'm not talking down to the InfoWars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride, and I'm talking about iodine.
[02:18:16.424 --> 02:18:26.553]  Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an old Glastron boat, and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[02:18:26.553 --> 02:18:28.895]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live.
[02:18:29.867 --> 02:18:31.448]  Okay, it's the same thing.
[02:18:31.448 --> 02:18:34.489]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride.
[02:18:34.489 --> 02:18:37.351]  That's why in every Western nation, they put it in the water.
[02:18:37.351 --> 02:18:39.492]  They're going to teach us Christians to lay down and die.
[02:18:39.492 --> 02:18:41.333]  The Chai Kams don't put it in the water.
[02:18:41.333 --> 02:18:42.854]  They'd execute you if you did that.
[02:18:42.854 --> 02:18:50.818]  They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else.
[02:18:50.818 --> 02:18:54.760]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:56.341]  We have all the documents and articles linked.
[02:18:56.681 --> 02:19:01.065]  And then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[02:19:01.065 --> 02:19:06.709]  Again, get iodine at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:08.471]  Here are the facts.
[02:19:09.748 --> 02:19:18.839]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies including the American Medical Journal.
[02:19:18.839 --> 02:19:25.267]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility.
[02:19:25.267 --> 02:19:26.288]  That's the facts.
[02:19:26.869 --> 02:19:32.553]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy, and then once you've learned about it, protect yourself and your family.
[02:19:32.553 --> 02:19:38.698]  The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine.
[02:19:38.698 --> 02:19:44.722]  In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people under their control.
[02:19:44.722 --> 02:19:46.864]  The globalists are targeting us here.
[02:19:46.864 --> 02:19:48.805]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:48.805 --> 02:19:52.428]  Experience iodine and biotruth selenium that goes with it together.
[02:19:52.708 --> 02:19:55.310]  Then once you see the great results, warn others.
[02:19:55.310 --> 02:19:57.411]  This is the Achilles heel of the globalist.
[02:19:57.411 --> 02:19:58.652]  It's a win-win situation.
[02:19:58.652 --> 02:20:00.393]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[02:20:00.393 --> 02:20:07.657]  Take action now.
[02:20:07.657 --> 02:20:10.299]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.632 --> 02:20:22.533]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:20:22.533 --> 02:20:29.339]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:29.339 --> 02:20:33.582]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:20:33.582 --> 02:20:48.153]  It's been well documented that leftists for over a hundred years in America have been writing about, talking about,
[02:20:49.468 --> 02:20:55.472]  Doing documentaries on how the planet is going to end in 10 years.
[02:20:55.472 --> 02:20:57.773]  Of course, it never does.
[02:20:57.773 --> 02:21:06.998]  Greta Thunberg will be 80 years old, doing speeches at the UN, telling you how the planet is going to die next year.
[02:21:06.998 --> 02:21:09.720]  And so it's really just a cult.
[02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:14.743]  So Alex Jones breaks down what is the climate change cult.
[02:21:16.457 --> 02:21:30.240]  In Hollywood, in the comic books growing up, the supervillains always hold the world hostage and promise to destroy it if you don't give in to their demands to let them rule the planet.
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:34.661]  Because, again, like thinking the brain says, everybody wants to rule the world.
[02:21:34.661 --> 02:21:40.822]  Well, the Club of Rome, a group of powerful robber barons and billionaires, back in the 60s got together and they publicly wrote
[02:21:41.678 --> 02:21:41.978]  I think so.
[02:21:57.054 --> 02:21:59.155]  Because we're the saviors of the Earth.
[02:21:59.155 --> 02:22:00.215]  That's so sick.
[02:22:00.215 --> 02:22:07.617]  When somebody tells you, do what I say or the world's gonna end, they're a cult leader, they're a criminal, they're a threat to everybody.
[02:22:07.617 --> 02:22:18.301]  And they use the whole attack on carbon dioxide and the carbon taxes they want us to pay them as a way to divert away from the genetic engineering, the terminator seeds, the toxic waste dumping, all of it.
[02:22:19.403 --> 02:22:22.166]  These people know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:22.166 --> 02:22:23.848]  They want a post-human world.
[02:22:23.848 --> 02:22:28.033]  And one of their adherents, of course, is Ted Turner, the founder of CNN.
[02:22:28.033 --> 02:22:33.098]  And he set up the Georgia Guidestones that calls for reducing the world down to 500 million people.
[02:22:33.098 --> 02:22:37.103]  And of course, these authoritarians, these savers of the earth, they're going to oversee it all.
[02:22:37.663 --> 02:22:41.607]  Here at InfoWars, we're fighting back against this cult.
[02:22:41.607 --> 02:22:58.665]  We're fighting back against these people that are telling you that you're the bad guys, you've been cast as that, I've been cast as that, and they are the saviors of the earth who are going to fly around in their private jets and live in palaces and have five kids, but you can't have a car, you can't have air conditioning, and you can't have children.
[02:22:59.125 --> 02:23:01.946]  This is a way to make slavery cool again.
[02:23:01.946 --> 02:23:02.927]  Surf them cool again.
[02:23:02.927 --> 02:23:05.308]  And InfoWars stands firmly against it.
[02:23:05.308 --> 02:23:08.129]  So whatever you do, remember, your destiny's in your hands.
[02:23:08.129 --> 02:23:15.433]  And when you spread the word about InfoWars.com for its last show and Banned.video, you shake these criminals to their very foundations.
[02:23:15.433 --> 02:23:16.713]  We've reached a tipping point.
[02:23:16.713 --> 02:23:17.834]  Press the attack.
[02:23:17.834 --> 02:23:20.715]  We will have a pro-human future.
[02:23:20.715 --> 02:23:26.038]  I don't think that we are discussing climate change the way we need to be discussing it.
[02:23:29.798 --> 02:23:34.619]  We are in the midst of climate change right now, and it is only going to get worse.
[02:23:34.619 --> 02:23:37.880]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:43.361]  The scientists also tell us, have 12 years in which to answer that question.
[02:23:43.361 --> 02:23:45.741]  12 years within which to act.
[02:23:45.741 --> 02:23:48.882]  Like, this is the war, this is our World War II.
[02:23:48.882 --> 02:23:51.422]  We have 12 years to turn this around.
[02:23:51.422 --> 02:23:56.043]  We are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes.
[02:23:57.845 --> 02:24:03.732]  Within the 10 years that we have left to us, we don't have more than 10 years to get this right.
[02:24:03.732 --> 02:24:06.055]  A little more than 10 years from now.
[02:24:06.055 --> 02:24:13.423]  There is no justice and there is no combating climate change without addressing what has happened to indigenous communities.
[02:24:13.423 --> 02:24:14.905]  I speak to you as a human being.
[02:24:15.786 --> 02:24:22.448]  A woman whose dreams of motherhood now taste bittersweet because of what I know about our children's future.
[02:24:22.448 --> 02:24:26.930]  You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.
[02:24:26.930 --> 02:24:28.450]  This is about our lives.
[02:24:28.450 --> 02:24:30.431]  This is about American lives.
[02:24:30.731 --> 02:24:36.053]  That our community will be uninhabitable, will not sustain human life along this current trajectory.
[02:24:36.053 --> 02:24:38.394]  I'm here to say our house is on fire.
[02:24:38.394 --> 02:24:41.795]  It's a crisis that could, at its worst, lead to extinction.
[02:24:41.795 --> 02:24:45.236]  We are in the beginning of a mass extinction.
[02:24:45.236 --> 02:24:46.716]  People are dying.
[02:24:46.716 --> 02:24:48.657]  People are suffering.
[02:24:48.657 --> 02:24:50.438]  People are dying.
[02:24:50.438 --> 02:24:51.238]  How dare you?
[02:25:01.621 --> 02:25:05.706]  Barack and Michelle Obama, they are buying a house in Martha's Vineyard.
[02:25:05.706 --> 02:25:10.733]  I shouldn't say house, this is a massive, incredible beachfront estate.
[02:25:10.733 --> 02:25:13.656]  Yeah, and of course, if the Obamas really believed in...
[02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:23.923]  Global warming or climate change or mass flooding or the boogeyman.
[02:25:23.923 --> 02:25:37.512]  They wouldn't have bought that mansion on the coast of California because it's going to be underwater in 10 years according to Beto and according to Ayok, the bartender.
[02:25:37.512 --> 02:25:40.774]  Now imagine if a bartender was telling you that stuff.
[02:25:40.774 --> 02:25:43.216]  You'd slap it off.
[02:25:43.216 --> 02:25:45.537]  Well, she still is, but people are taking her seriously.
[02:25:45.537 --> 02:25:48.119]  You know, it's funny because
[02:25:49.721 --> 02:25:58.407]  If you wanted to bring up man-made climate change or let's say man-made global surface change, I mean, there's obviously a certain element of truth to that.
[02:25:58.407 --> 02:26:03.671]  I mean, we build massive cities with concrete and steel structures and everything.
[02:26:03.671 --> 02:26:04.872]  I mean, that's not natural.
[02:26:04.872 --> 02:26:08.194]  That's not built by nature.
[02:26:08.194 --> 02:26:10.456]  So there is like an element of that if you want to sit here and say,
[02:26:12.171 --> 02:26:17.632]  Uh, maybe when human population reaches 500 billion, we can't really sustain the Earth anymore.
[02:26:17.632 --> 02:26:20.033]  That's not 10 years away.
[02:26:20.033 --> 02:26:21.133]  We're nowhere near that point.
[02:26:21.133 --> 02:26:23.874]  These people want to live on Mars in the next 10 years.
[02:26:23.874 --> 02:26:27.894]  I mean, heck, if we can't even sustain life here, how are we going to live on Mars?
[02:26:27.894 --> 02:26:33.356]  I don't know if they ever thought about that one.
[02:26:33.356 --> 02:26:34.916]  But again, it's been well documented.
[02:26:37.065 --> 02:26:47.454]  How this scare tactic of the world is going to end because of man-made weather changes has been going on for a hundred years.
[02:26:47.454 --> 02:26:53.900]  They don't show the Al Gore documentary anymore in public schools, do they?
[02:26:53.900 --> 02:26:55.682]  They don't show that, no.
[02:26:55.682 --> 02:26:59.405]  They show AOC, the new Al Gore.
[02:26:59.405 --> 02:27:02.268]  Al Gore was a white man.
[02:27:03.837 --> 02:27:09.160]  And it turned out that his documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, was all wrong.
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:14.422]  They did show it to kids in schools, though, when it came out.
[02:27:14.422 --> 02:27:16.644]  Mandatory viewing.
[02:27:16.644 --> 02:27:19.185]  Make sure you propagandize those kids.
[02:27:19.185 --> 02:27:20.806]  But now that's a thing of the past.
[02:27:20.806 --> 02:27:24.287]  The old white man, he's a demon.
[02:27:24.287 --> 02:27:29.770]  You can't promote the old white Al Gore, so you bring in the young.
[02:27:29.770 --> 02:27:31.211]  You bring in the brown lady.
[02:27:32.398 --> 02:27:39.562]  You bring in the bartender and you say, go get him.
[02:27:39.562 --> 02:27:39.962]  She does.
[02:27:39.962 --> 02:27:43.424]  She starts crying.
[02:27:43.424 --> 02:27:50.288]  She starts crying because she can't, she thinks, have kids because the world's gonna end.
[02:27:50.288 --> 02:27:58.372]  I don't think she planned on having kids anyway, if we're being perfectly honest.
[02:27:58.372 --> 02:27:59.493]  But that's neither here nor there.
[02:28:00.276 --> 02:28:07.078]  They know it's all a lie, they know it's all a front, but they get off on the fear porn.
[02:28:07.078 --> 02:28:09.819]  But the sad thing is, they target the youth.
[02:28:09.819 --> 02:28:14.820]  And that is the criminal act that they're engaged in.
[02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:17.061]  Because you go around, and what do the kids think?
[02:28:17.061 --> 02:28:20.202]  The world's gonna end in 10 years, AOC told me.
[02:28:20.202 --> 02:28:23.562]  Just like the world's gonna end in 10 years, Al Gore told me.
[02:28:23.562 --> 02:28:27.143]  And yet, here we are.
[02:28:27.143 --> 02:28:28.884]  And so that is the climate change cult.
[02:28:31.246 --> 02:28:43.383]  Maybe if they wanted to get into real issues with how to treat the land, take care of the land, raise cattle, be a rancher, be a farmer, but they're not.
[02:28:44.616 --> 02:28:46.358]  They hang out in the cities.
[02:28:46.358 --> 02:28:47.759]  They're bug people.
[02:28:47.759 --> 02:28:50.622]  They have their cell phones attached to their retinas.
[02:28:50.622 --> 02:29:01.372]  These are the cockroaches that will live in the major metropolitan cities forever, but then cry about climate change and then take your money and say they're fighting it.
[02:29:01.372 --> 02:29:02.734]  Mike Adams joins us on the other side.
[02:29:04.139 --> 02:29:08.700]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:29:08.700 --> 02:29:10.780]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:10.780 --> 02:29:12.521]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:12.521 --> 02:29:19.062]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:19.062 --> 02:29:24.143]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:24.143 --> 02:29:28.844]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:29.284 --> 02:29:32.406]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[02:29:32.406 --> 02:29:39.411]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[02:29:39.411 --> 02:29:44.594]  And if you have PPO private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[02:29:44.594 --> 02:29:47.896]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[02:29:47.896 --> 02:29:48.837]  Get clean.
[02:29:48.837 --> 02:29:50.678]  Call now and learn more.
[02:29:50.678 --> 02:29:50.718]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:54.701 --> 02:29:54.962]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:54.962 --> 02:29:55.162]  That's 800-506-6740.
[02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:08.782]  InfoWars presents Alex Jones.
[02:30:08.782 --> 02:30:24.052]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious, came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies die in the womb, and it causes cancer.
[02:30:24.052 --> 02:30:26.674]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[02:30:27.114 --> 02:30:34.001]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[02:30:34.001 --> 02:30:42.610]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children.
[02:30:42.610 --> 02:30:49.017]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:49.017 --> 02:30:49.297]  Drink
[02:30:49.497 --> 02:30:51.559]  Drink fluoride and die!
[02:30:51.559 --> 02:30:54.882]  Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over!
[02:30:54.882 --> 02:30:58.426]  Do not visit InfoWarsTore.com and get high-quality iodine to counter it.
[02:30:58.426 --> 02:30:58.746]  No!
[02:30:58.746 --> 02:31:00.708]  Roll over and die, dirty Americans!
[02:31:05.293 --> 02:31:10.836]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[02:31:10.836 --> 02:31:13.858]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[02:31:13.858 --> 02:31:18.281]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[02:31:18.281 --> 02:31:24.885]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[02:31:25.345 --> 02:31:31.350]  They might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[02:31:31.350 --> 02:31:36.735]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[02:31:36.735 --> 02:31:44.322]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[02:31:44.502 --> 02:31:45.403]  It's that simple.
[02:31:45.403 --> 02:31:51.610]  Find out about the Iodine Conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[02:31:51.610 --> 02:31:55.394]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research Iodine Deficiency.
[02:31:55.394 --> 02:31:57.336]  It's the key to everything.
[02:31:57.336 --> 02:32:04.945]  And then, go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality Iodine and BioTruth Selenium at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[02:32:05.205 --> 02:32:11.328]  Now what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners.
[02:32:11.328 --> 02:32:12.588]  I'm just stating the facts.
[02:32:12.588 --> 02:32:13.789]  I own a chainsaw.
[02:32:13.789 --> 02:32:15.729]  I've had it since I was in college.
[02:32:15.729 --> 02:32:19.751]  And it's a great good old chainsaw and I've used it probably 500 times.
[02:32:19.751 --> 02:32:26.514]  But a few times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it.
[02:32:26.514 --> 02:32:28.635]  Now imagine if somebody told me to put
[02:32:29.395 --> 02:32:33.958]  Let's say superglue in the oil container on it, it would seize up forever.
[02:32:33.958 --> 02:32:35.740]  But only an evil person would do that.
[02:32:35.740 --> 02:32:38.702]  Well, fluoride's like putting superglue in a chainsaw.
[02:32:38.702 --> 02:32:39.923]  It's going to make it seize up.
[02:32:39.923 --> 02:32:41.644]  And that's why they put it in the water.
[02:32:41.644 --> 02:32:43.845]  And they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family.
[02:32:43.845 --> 02:32:45.106]  Yes, they're really evil.
[02:32:45.106 --> 02:32:50.030]  Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication.
[02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:50.930]  It's that simple.
[02:32:50.930 --> 02:32:54.573]  I know you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late.
[02:32:54.573 --> 02:32:56.334]  It's part of the iodine conspiracy.
[02:32:56.334 --> 02:32:59.016]  Find out more at Infowarsstore.com and take action.
[02:32:59.216 --> 02:33:01.059]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:20.576 --> 02:33:27.020]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:33:27.020 --> 02:33:29.361]  It's Owen Troyer.
[02:33:29.361 --> 02:33:36.906]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:36.906 --> 02:33:42.049]  Mike Adams joins me now, and there is a lot of news we can get to here.
[02:33:44.656 --> 02:33:46.918]  I'm not sure where Mike Adams wants to go.
[02:33:46.918 --> 02:33:52.142]  Let me just quickly lay a few things out.
[02:33:52.142 --> 02:34:08.416]  You've got the left, which I'm going to really delve deep into in the first hour of the war room today at three o'clock at Infowars.com slash Owen Bandot video now calling for direct attacks on individuals that donate to Donald Trump.
[02:34:11.553 --> 02:34:13.617]  I feel remissed not telling you this.
[02:34:13.617 --> 02:34:15.100]  It just needs to be said.
[02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:17.625]  If we ever get the credit, we probably never will.
[02:34:18.931 --> 02:34:22.312]  InfoWars has been telling you that this is going to happen for months.
[02:34:22.312 --> 02:34:29.133]  And in fact, I went back and got the clips that I'm going to air on The War Room today just to show that we told you this was happening.
[02:34:29.133 --> 02:34:33.454]  Because they want to make fun of InfoWars and say we're fake news or conspiracy theorists and all that.
[02:34:33.454 --> 02:34:34.735]  We just continue to get proven right.
[02:34:34.735 --> 02:34:38.175]  But, you know, maybe we should just start proving how we're right all the time.
[02:34:38.175 --> 02:34:42.216]  Showing the clips from months ago when we're next month's news today.
[02:34:42.216 --> 02:34:43.577]  Mike Adams has been covering this.
[02:34:45.197 --> 02:34:50.239]  And so part of that includes Barack Obama being at a Soros fundraiser yesterday.
[02:34:50.239 --> 02:34:58.582]  The racist watch that is literally targeting individuals for violence if they support Trump.
[02:34:58.582 --> 02:35:07.425]  And of course you have the news today in an absolute uproar over President Trump using the phrase lynching because somehow that's racist now.
[02:35:09.737 --> 02:35:12.360]  They'll change the name of a building if it says Lynch on it, I guess.
[02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:16.364]  Even though I think that's like Irish, actually.
[02:35:16.364 --> 02:35:19.487]  Like Mediterranean, maybe, even.
[02:35:19.487 --> 02:35:30.218]  But it turns out that phrase was actually used by CNN in 2015 to describe what Republicans were doing to Hillary Clinton!
[02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:34.783]  And in fact, if you pull that tweet up, here it is, CNN.
[02:35:34.783 --> 02:35:37.506]  The high-tech lynching of Hillary Clinton.
[02:35:37.506 --> 02:35:39.007]  Benghazi hearings.
[02:35:39.007 --> 02:35:46.193]  Ooh, but you know Mike, that's actually odd because Judicial Watch just got brand new emails yesterday.
[02:35:46.193 --> 02:35:49.717]  New Benghazi documents confirm Clinton email cover-up.
[02:35:50.217 --> 02:35:53.619]  Her, Obama, they all knew about what was going on at Benghazi.
[02:35:53.619 --> 02:36:04.364]  It really looks like it was actually, they were dealing arms illegally through Benghazi, and the terrorists that attacked Benghazi were trying to stop Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama from moving those arms.
[02:36:04.364 --> 02:36:12.768]  They were high-crime arms dealers in the region, and so the terrorists got word of it, found out that it was Clinton and Obama targeted the embassy.
[02:36:12.768 --> 02:36:13.968]  Clinton knew it was going to happen.
[02:36:13.968 --> 02:36:14.849]  She stood down.
[02:36:14.849 --> 02:36:16.209]  She deleted the evidence.
[02:36:16.209 --> 02:36:17.270]  Judicial Watch now has it.
[02:36:18.050 --> 02:36:22.091]  So, Mike, this is just some of the news that's going around right now.
[02:36:22.091 --> 02:36:31.574]  But isn't it really incredible that the left is now openly targeting conservatives for violent attack as they're getting caught up in all their crimes?
[02:36:31.574 --> 02:36:34.254]  And I think that that's really what this is all about, Mike.
[02:36:34.254 --> 02:36:42.317]  The Democrats are getting caught up in all their crimes in Ukraine, which is where the Democrat and Hillary Clinton's servers are being held illegally right now.
[02:36:42.317 --> 02:36:43.337]  They don't report on that.
[02:36:44.709 --> 02:36:50.112]  Whatever we can get from Judicial Watch, it turns out the Democrats are just guilty of all of it.
[02:36:50.112 --> 02:36:59.216]  And then Trump says lynch, saying they're politically lynching me, which he's absolutely correct about, and it's the end of the world, we have to remove Trump.
[02:36:59.216 --> 02:37:02.097]  So Mike Adams joins me from NaturalNews.com.
[02:37:02.097 --> 02:37:03.838]  Mike, how do you sum all of this up?
[02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:07.814]  Well, make no mistake, this is more faux outrage.
[02:37:07.814 --> 02:37:10.058]  As Rush Limbaugh says, they're the drive-by media.
[02:37:10.058 --> 02:37:15.426]  They engage in these drive-by shootings of sorts to try to attack Trump over really non-issues.
[02:37:15.426 --> 02:37:19.552]  Remember, it's the left that calls everybody who's a conservative a Nazi.
[02:37:20.272 --> 02:37:29.937]  And, of course, no one on the left gets banned from Facebook or Twitter or Google, you know, for calling Trump supporters Nazis, even though it's absurd.
[02:37:29.937 --> 02:37:40.381]  There's no evidence whatsoever to suggest that anyone... Yeah, my Facebook said that they're done policing political speech, and I assumed that meant I could be back on the platform, and then they banned me yesterday!
[02:37:40.381 --> 02:37:42.662]  Good luck with that, right.
[02:37:42.662 --> 02:37:45.244]  Yeah, well, of course, you know, Zuckerberg is lying.
[02:37:45.244 --> 02:37:47.905]  He's trying to position himself as being pro-free speech as he's
[02:37:48.805 --> 02:37:49.766]  Destroying free speech.
[02:37:49.766 --> 02:38:04.231]  But look, what's important to understand here, the Racism Watch website, or Racist Watch, whatever it's called, this is the transition of the left's war against America now becoming a war against the American people.
[02:38:04.231 --> 02:38:05.792]  So they are now distributing
[02:38:06.392 --> 02:38:11.055]  The home addresses and names of people who have donated to President Trump.
[02:38:11.055 --> 02:38:14.958]  This is an attack list, a kill list, if you will.
[02:38:14.958 --> 02:38:28.507]  Remember when they went after Sarah Palin for just showing a crosshairs target over the districts that she was targeting to win in her campaign efforts, and she was assaulted verbally by the media for that.
[02:38:28.507 --> 02:38:34.851]  Well, now the left is actually pushing out the names and addresses of Trump supporters, and there's no outcry from the left.
[02:38:35.191 --> 02:38:49.267]  So they can call you a Nazi, Owen, but you can't say that Trump is being lynched, and you can't ever publish a list of where Hillary Clinton supporters live, or you'd be accused, you'd probably be arrested.
[02:38:49.267 --> 02:38:50.889]  Hey, rightfully so!
[02:38:50.889 --> 02:38:51.129]  Yeah!
[02:38:52.328 --> 02:38:55.051]  Of course, it's totally illegally obtained information.
[02:38:55.051 --> 02:38:57.032]  We're not going to get any investigations, by the way.
[02:38:57.032 --> 02:39:01.676]  I mean, I'm not going to bash Trump on this, but there's going to be no investigations.
[02:39:01.676 --> 02:39:05.279]  There's no local police, no local law enforcement, no FBI, most likely.
[02:39:05.279 --> 02:39:07.802]  And so, yeah, this is why they want to disarm us.
[02:39:07.802 --> 02:39:09.603]  Ah, you see how that works.
[02:39:09.603 --> 02:39:11.885]  But Mike, you've been reporting on this.
[02:39:11.885 --> 02:39:12.606]  I've been reporting on this.
[02:39:12.606 --> 02:39:13.827]  I'm going to play the clips in the War Room.
[02:39:16.307 --> 02:39:18.208]  I was saying, and they're also taking down the power grid.
[02:39:18.208 --> 02:39:23.712]  Remember, California just announced they're going to have up to 10 years of deliberate power outages in the future.
[02:39:23.712 --> 02:39:28.335]  Let's get into that, because this is actually a huge story.
[02:39:28.335 --> 02:39:37.581]  Because it felt to me like the PG&E representatives or president or whoever is sitting here saying, look, the demands you're putting on us are impossible.
[02:39:37.581 --> 02:39:43.205]  We'll have to shut down the power grid for 10 years to meet these demands because they're getting complaints about these fires and everything.
[02:39:43.945 --> 02:39:52.005]  And so it's really a convoluted situation happening up there, and it kind of just emphasizes, yeah, you know, when you start to move towards communism and socialism, guess what?
[02:39:52.005 --> 02:39:53.488]  You literally don't have power.
[02:39:54.468 --> 02:39:54.928]  Well, right.
[02:39:54.928 --> 02:39:57.451]  I mean, this is Calizuela unfolding.
[02:39:57.451 --> 02:39:59.012]  It's the California version of Venezuela.
[02:39:59.012 --> 02:40:03.916]  Remember when the Venezuelan government took over all the factories, the bread factories, the toilet paper factories?
[02:40:03.916 --> 02:40:07.939]  They all stopped producing products because socialists and communists don't know how to produce anything.
[02:40:07.939 --> 02:40:09.841]  All they do is consume and destroy.
[02:40:09.841 --> 02:40:12.824]  So PG&E is really an extension of the California government.
[02:40:12.824 --> 02:40:14.205]  It's heavily regulated.
[02:40:14.205 --> 02:40:20.090]  It's essentially controlled by the corrupt criminal cartel known as Governor Newsom and Nancy Pelosi and all these other people.
[02:40:20.730 --> 02:40:22.711]  And they will destroy California.
[02:40:22.711 --> 02:40:24.271]  It will become Calizuela.
[02:40:24.271 --> 02:40:25.391]  It's already happening.
[02:40:25.391 --> 02:40:33.014]  It's collapsing into a third world infrastructure with third world diseases now breaking out on the streets of San Francisco, Los Angeles and other places.
[02:40:33.014 --> 02:40:39.916]  This is what they're gonna do to the entire nation if Democrats seize power and eliminate Trump.
[02:40:39.916 --> 02:40:40.516]  And by the way,
[02:40:41.354 --> 02:40:48.141]  The other reason they want to impeach Trump is because they know it will crater the stock market, and they want a market crash.
[02:40:48.141 --> 02:40:50.123]  They want to destroy this economy.
[02:40:50.123 --> 02:40:55.769]  They are willing to destroy this entire nation if they can get rid of Trump in the process, Owen.
[02:40:55.769 --> 02:41:03.557]  Well, and it looks like, to me, and again, this isn't, I mean, you can criticize Trump, you can compliment Trump, you know, we just want to call it fair here.
[02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:09.285]  Trump has all the dirt on these Democrats, and I think it's more obvious than ever.
[02:41:09.285 --> 02:41:21.040]  I don't know if you saw his interview on Hannity last night, but he's basically signaling to the American people is, look, we're dealing with corrupt criminal people that really, I couldn't even begin to explain.
[02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:24.971]  And he's basically given him three years to just leave him alone.
[02:41:24.971 --> 02:41:35.634]  I mean, beyond that, he's even let them abuse him and torture him and his family politically, legally, and all of his supporters, and he even said it, they've ruined people's lives.
[02:41:35.634 --> 02:41:37.774]  So he's allowed all this to go on.
[02:41:37.774 --> 02:41:44.516]  I think kind of like a noble, I guess, leader, if you will, it's reaching a point.
[02:41:44.516 --> 02:41:47.597]  And I think the president is signaling to America, hey, look, you know,
[02:41:49.070 --> 02:41:50.411]  They're the ones in trouble here.
[02:41:50.411 --> 02:41:53.732]  All the accusations they're making are only going to end up back on them.
[02:41:53.732 --> 02:41:57.294]  Now, will AG Barr take action?
[02:41:57.294 --> 02:41:59.275]  Will there be any action in Congress?
[02:41:59.275 --> 02:42:02.776]  Will there be any action by the FBI, DOJ, and whoever?
[02:42:02.776 --> 02:42:03.097]  I don't know.
[02:42:03.097 --> 02:42:05.418]  That's a different question.
[02:42:05.418 --> 02:42:12.641]  But I think the President signaled, yeah, we know that they're the ones that are actually involved in all this stuff, and if we have to, we will expose them.
[02:42:13.666 --> 02:42:18.488]  Well, it is absolutely time for the President to have these documents released.
[02:42:18.488 --> 02:42:22.430]  Of course, he's waiting on William Barr, waiting on Durham.
[02:42:22.430 --> 02:42:26.352]  You know, they're trying to dot all the I's and cross their T's and so on.
[02:42:26.352 --> 02:42:32.094]  And sadly, they keep finding more and more corruption, which seems to be extending the investigation.
[02:42:32.094 --> 02:42:33.455]  Well, that's exactly it.
[02:42:33.455 --> 02:42:36.276]  Let's focus on that in the next segment with Mike Adams from Natural News.
[02:42:36.276 --> 02:42:38.357]  We're going to break here, but that's it exactly.
[02:42:38.357 --> 02:42:40.578]  And there's two things that are the key here, which we'll discuss.
[02:42:41.613 --> 02:42:44.255]  Joseph Misfood is still missing.
[02:42:44.255 --> 02:42:44.815]  Or dead.
[02:42:44.815 --> 02:42:46.557]  Nobody knows.
[02:42:46.557 --> 02:43:00.947]  And, as Mike Adams said, they keep having to expand this probe because it keeps getting deeper and deeper and more intertwined with other foreign intelligence agencies, more intertwined with domestic intelligence agencies and names like Obama and Brennan and Clapper.
[02:43:00.947 --> 02:43:05.710]  We break it all down on the other side with Mike Adams.
[02:43:05.710 --> 02:43:07.452]  Here are the facts.
[02:43:08.724 --> 02:43:17.811]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies including the American Medical Journal.
[02:43:17.811 --> 02:43:24.236]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility.
[02:43:24.236 --> 02:43:25.077]  That's the fact.
[02:43:27.619 --> 02:43:27.919]  I think?
[02:43:53.231 --> 02:43:54.291]  Warn others.
[02:43:54.291 --> 02:43:56.392]  This is the Achilles heel of the globalist.
[02:43:56.392 --> 02:43:57.612]  It's a win-win situation.
[02:43:57.612 --> 02:43:59.352]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[02:43:59.352 --> 02:44:00.632]  Take action now.
[02:44:00.632 --> 02:44:06.493]  Hello today on All Things Considered.
[02:44:06.493 --> 02:44:16.015]  I'm Wilbur Snakely here to tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[02:44:16.015 --> 02:44:19.796]  Now sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that
[02:44:20.336 --> 02:44:26.080]  It's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:27.000]  That's right.
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:28.881]  Drink the fluoride.
[02:44:28.881 --> 02:44:33.224]  Don't visit Infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen.
[02:44:33.224 --> 02:44:34.665]  I mean the bad halogen.
[02:44:34.665 --> 02:44:35.385]  Iodine.
[02:44:35.385 --> 02:44:38.167]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[02:44:38.907 --> 02:44:45.333]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us.
[02:44:45.333 --> 02:44:46.995]  We don't want to compete with you.
[02:44:46.995 --> 02:44:49.678]  Just drink the fluoride.
[02:44:49.678 --> 02:44:53.441]  Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do.
[02:44:53.441 --> 02:44:55.603]  Don't support Alex Jones.
[02:44:55.603 --> 02:45:00.047]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm liberal.
[02:45:00.047 --> 02:45:02.169]  Oh, and let Nambla have access to your children.
[02:45:07.492 --> 02:45:08.753]  Hello, here.
[02:45:08.753 --> 02:45:10.734]  My name is Bethelme.
[02:45:10.734 --> 02:45:13.575]  I work for my father, Lucifer.
[02:45:13.575 --> 02:45:23.179]  And he doesn't like the fact that God gave you all families and children, and so... We want to tell you something right now, Christian countries.
[02:45:23.179 --> 02:45:25.620]  We took control of you over a hundred years ago.
[02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:30.663]  We've been spiking your water with fluoride to lower your fertility and to hurt you.
[02:45:31.423 --> 02:45:42.975]  And it's worked so well, but now because of liability, and because of people warning inside the government what's happening, the Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done.
[02:45:42.975 --> 02:45:49.081]  And it makes me so angry, so whatever you do, just stay in that haze, and drink fluoride and give it to your children.
[02:45:51.295 --> 02:46:00.875]  And go visit InfoWarsTore.com and learn about the Iodine Conspiracy and get 60% off on X2 and X3 together with BioCrew Selenium from the mustard seed.
[02:46:00.875 --> 02:46:01.656]  Submit to us!
[02:46:03.551 --> 02:46:05.712]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:05.712 --> 02:46:16.917]  Again, I'm not talking down to the Infowars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride, and I'm talking about iodine.
[02:46:16.917 --> 02:46:27.041]  Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an old Blastron boat, and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[02:46:27.041 --> 02:46:29.362]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live.
[02:46:30.345 --> 02:46:31.927]  Okay, it's the same thing.
[02:46:31.927 --> 02:46:34.991]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride.
[02:46:34.991 --> 02:46:37.855]  That's why, in every western nation, they put it in the water.
[02:46:37.855 --> 02:46:39.978]  They're gonna teach us Christians to lay down and die.
[02:46:39.978 --> 02:46:41.820]  The Chai Kams don't put it in the water.
[02:46:41.820 --> 02:46:43.342]  They'd execute you if you did that.
[02:46:43.342 --> 02:46:44.925]  They put iodine in the water,
[02:46:45.285 --> 02:46:46.825]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:20.845 --> 02:47:21.966]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:21.966 --> 02:47:24.669]  Owen Troyer, Mike Adams with you.
[02:47:24.669 --> 02:47:31.697]  And before the break, I was saying how we're going to get into how the Democrats engaged in so many crimes.
[02:47:31.697 --> 02:47:33.800]  I mean, folks, and it's not just the Democrats.
[02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:36.443]  I mean, the Bush administration before that, too.
[02:47:36.443 --> 02:47:41.549]  But we tend to view things in a narrow scope, a more direct approach.
[02:47:42.793 --> 02:47:46.355]  And you just look back and think about all the corruption, Mike.
[02:47:46.355 --> 02:47:56.559]  Benghazi, Fast and Furious, the IRS scandal, the Spygate, all the political laundering that was happening in Ukraine.
[02:47:56.559 --> 02:48:03.683]  I mean, just all the stuff the deep state Democrats have been involved in to try to keep Trump out of office and now try to get him out of office.
[02:48:04.690 --> 02:48:20.314]  And we were discussing how now that the Democrats are closer to being pushed over the ledge politically than ever before for all their crimes, they're invoking their militant wing, Nazifa, to go out and start engaging in attacks.
[02:48:20.314 --> 02:48:22.635]  And that's really what it is.
[02:48:22.635 --> 02:48:26.796]  Quote-unquote Antifa is really the brown shirt Nazis, so it's Nazifa.
[02:48:27.887 --> 02:48:36.912]  But Mike, I'm sitting here thinking about all that, and then I get back into where they're going with this whole man-made climate change thing, and Alex Jones really hit it on the head.
[02:48:36.912 --> 02:48:41.674]  I almost want to go into that, where they're trying to make slavery cool.
[02:48:41.674 --> 02:48:48.637]  Like, oh, you're giving everything up for the greater good of the planet, or you're giving everything up for the greater good of humanity.
[02:48:48.637 --> 02:48:49.698]  No, you're not!
[02:48:49.698 --> 02:48:51.739]  You're giving everything up for the greater good of the elite!
[02:48:52.745 --> 02:48:54.546]  And again, South Park just nails it out of the park.
[02:48:54.546 --> 02:48:59.088]  I don't know if you saw their last episode about meatless burgers, but it's the same thing.
[02:48:59.088 --> 02:49:00.088]  Make it trendy.
[02:49:00.088 --> 02:49:02.289]  Oh, here's your meatless burger.
[02:49:02.289 --> 02:49:03.970]  Oh, I'm sustainable.
[02:49:03.970 --> 02:49:05.090]  I'm trendy.
[02:49:05.090 --> 02:49:08.332]  It's the same garbage you were eating before.
[02:49:08.332 --> 02:49:12.213]  It's just trendy and cool now, and then they get all the red meat.
[02:49:12.213 --> 02:49:15.014]  They get all the ranch, the cattle, and everything for themselves.
[02:49:15.014 --> 02:49:17.475]  So, Mike, just two paths right there.
[02:49:17.475 --> 02:49:18.596]  You choose which one to go down.
[02:49:19.281 --> 02:49:20.782]  Well, let's talk about the food issue.
[02:49:20.782 --> 02:49:26.365]  Yeah, this processed vegan burger junk food.
[02:49:26.365 --> 02:49:31.428]  You know, ten years ago or even five years ago, everybody was saying it's bad to eat processed food.
[02:49:31.428 --> 02:49:41.414]  Now they're positioning processed food loaded with GMOs and glyphosate herbicide and other toxic processed ingredients and taste enhancers and so on.
[02:49:41.414 --> 02:49:43.676]  Now they're saying this is green and this is eco-friendly.
[02:49:44.416 --> 02:49:45.257]  This is insane.
[02:49:45.257 --> 02:49:52.042]  It's just as insane as a biological male winning the gold medal for the women's cycling team.
[02:49:52.042 --> 02:50:03.729]  Let's get into the psychology of this, Mike, because it's something really hard to tap into unless you can really get into this deep psychological level and study it.
[02:50:03.729 --> 02:50:09.493]  But the elite see the mass population eating junk food.
[02:50:09.493 --> 02:50:10.674]  Just total garbage food.
[02:50:10.674 --> 02:50:12.736]  Call it a Whopper, call it a Big Mac, whatever.
[02:50:13.456 --> 02:50:23.382]  And so, they figure, well you know what, the process of making all this junk food is no good for our bottom line here, and our bottom line here.
[02:50:23.382 --> 02:50:34.208]  And so we can make it trendy, and say, oh, you're eating junk food, but no, it's not meat, so you're not killing the planet now, you're saving the planet, even though it's the same junk food.
[02:50:34.208 --> 02:50:36.630]  So it's really just an insult to the peasants,
[02:50:37.290 --> 02:50:40.554]  So, soybeans, which are one of the main ingredients in those fake meat burgers, soybeans,
[02:50:54.259 --> 02:51:02.829]  Are linked to massive deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest, which the left is going insane over deforestation.
[02:51:02.829 --> 02:51:03.489]  But guess what?
[02:51:03.489 --> 02:51:08.295]  That's how their soybeans are grown in their meatless veggie patties.
[02:51:09.214 --> 02:51:21.762]  And so they're actually encouraging financially, they're voting for ecological destruction by eating this fake meat, which by the way is trucked from thousands of miles away, its ingredients are.
[02:51:21.762 --> 02:51:27.646]  So you have all of the fossil fuel footprint that the left is so insane about as well.
[02:51:27.646 --> 02:51:30.628]  You know what's ecologically sustainable?
[02:51:30.628 --> 02:51:32.850]  Cows on a ranch in Texas.
[02:51:33.550 --> 02:51:34.832]  They go get their own water.
[02:51:34.832 --> 02:51:36.133]  They go find their own food.
[02:51:36.133 --> 02:51:38.496]  That's beyond ecologically sustainable!
[02:51:38.496 --> 02:51:40.358]  That IS ecology!
[02:51:40.358 --> 02:51:42.360]  That literally is the lifeblood of Earth!
[02:51:43.959 --> 02:51:47.120]  Yes, look, you don't even have to pump water to the cows.
[02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:49.621]  You just have like a pond or a tank.
[02:51:49.621 --> 02:51:50.982]  They're all over the ranches of Texas.
[02:51:50.982 --> 02:51:52.683]  The cows go there and get their own water.
[02:51:52.683 --> 02:51:57.044]  You don't even have to bring them food most of the time, except when it gets a little cold outside.
[02:51:57.044 --> 02:51:59.665]  So, you know, cows go gather their own food.
[02:51:59.665 --> 02:52:06.528]  Cows can turn barren land that is useless for agriculture into an actual food source.
[02:52:06.528 --> 02:52:13.551]  Now, look, I'm not a fan of some of the factory farming situations, but free-range cows,
[02:52:14.191 --> 02:52:17.132]  Totally ecologically sustainable.
[02:52:17.132 --> 02:52:24.375]  It is a food source for humanity, and these fake meat burgers are an insult to ecology and an insult to humanity.
[02:52:24.375 --> 02:52:26.295]  I've looked at this extensively, Owen.
[02:52:26.295 --> 02:52:31.837]  You know, in fact, we're going to be running some lab tests on some of these fake meat burgers soon, so maybe we'll break some of that news for you.
[02:52:31.837 --> 02:52:32.878]  Yeah, no, that'd be great.
[02:52:32.878 --> 02:52:37.299]  You should keep us informed on that if you want us to send a reporter down there too, because this is going to be key.
[02:52:37.299 --> 02:52:42.061]  Because I'm telling you, this is, and I don't even know if I'm explaining it well, but it's like,
[02:52:43.556 --> 02:52:53.503]  A super elitist looks down on humanity, looks down on the droves of humanity, obsessing over fake boobs and fake butts and their favorite sports teams.
[02:52:53.503 --> 02:52:54.523]  They're rigging markets.
[02:52:54.523 --> 02:52:55.524]  They're rigging countries.
[02:52:55.524 --> 02:52:56.925]  They're fighting for battle lines.
[02:52:56.925 --> 02:52:58.906]  They're engaged in warfare.
[02:52:58.906 --> 02:53:06.731]  So the little peasants over here eating their Burger King or whatever, that's just cannon fodder for them.
[02:53:06.731 --> 02:53:10.553]  So they figure, you're already eating crap.
[02:53:10.553 --> 02:53:12.575]  I'm trying to figure out a way to explain this.
[02:53:13.803 --> 02:53:19.064]  The elite that disdain humanity are looking at the masses saying, you're already eating garbage.
[02:53:19.064 --> 02:53:21.204]  You're literally eating garbage all day long.
[02:53:21.204 --> 02:53:34.527]  So, we might as well just give you our garbage, and we'll say, oh, this is environmentally friendly, and now we're saving you from the cows, even though, again, like, you need to have ranchers, you need to have farms, you need to have cattle.
[02:53:34.527 --> 02:53:35.987]  It's necessary.
[02:53:35.987 --> 02:53:40.748]  So it's like this weird double timing, it's like this weird double rape of reality,
[02:53:41.548 --> 02:53:50.951]  And they get rid of the ecology, they get rid of the healthy diet, and then really what they're thinking is, you already eat garbage, peasant, so you're gonna eat this garbage now.
[02:53:50.951 --> 02:53:54.973]  I know, it's so bad you could almost call it a lynching of the ecosystem, couldn't you?
[02:53:56.804 --> 02:53:58.905]  If you dared, if you were to say such a thing.
[02:53:58.905 --> 02:54:01.966]  No, but it's, look, it's about an attack on everything that is sustainable.
[02:54:01.966 --> 02:54:05.767]  So the attack on heterosexuality is part of this as well.
[02:54:05.767 --> 02:54:11.068]  The attack on normal sexual reproduction, which is the continuation of the species.
[02:54:11.068 --> 02:54:17.550]  Let's be honest, every species that's living out there, mammals, is a male and female based reproduction.
[02:54:17.550 --> 02:54:19.331]  And that's under attack by the radical left.
[02:54:19.711 --> 02:54:31.218]  You know, they're now saying that chemically castrating children is required by the jury in Dallas, Texas, you know, and that if you try to protect a child from being chemically assaulted, then you're intolerant.
[02:54:31.218 --> 02:54:33.699]  But you have to take the vaccine, though, because of freedom.
[02:54:34.841 --> 02:54:43.404]  Well, right, and the vaccine, of course, contains genetically modified cancer-causing human aborted fetal cells and genes.
[02:54:43.404 --> 02:54:46.526]  So, to give you cancer, because that's good, according to the left.
[02:54:46.526 --> 02:54:50.407]  So, you know, it's about killing everything that is sustainable.
[02:54:50.407 --> 02:54:56.349]  Isn't it, Mike, isn't it like a Mad Max thing, where, again, the elite are going to hoard all this for themselves.
[02:54:56.349 --> 02:54:58.870]  They want you to think there's no such thing as two genders.
[02:54:58.870 --> 02:55:02.452]  They want you to think, oh, you can't have a cow or a chicken, you're killing the earth.
[02:55:02.972 --> 02:55:07.396]  They're going to have whole ranches and farms with cows and chickens and men and women!
[02:55:07.396 --> 02:55:09.317]  And they're going to hide it all from the masses!
[02:55:09.317 --> 02:55:10.938]  That's really what this is about!
[02:55:10.938 --> 02:55:14.381]  And people tend to live in a bubble, Mike.
[02:55:14.381 --> 02:55:15.802]  We live in a linear timeline.
[02:55:15.802 --> 02:55:18.544]  It's a blink of an eye in God's creation here.
[02:55:18.544 --> 02:55:20.226]  So we don't tend to understand where it goes.
[02:55:21.155 --> 02:55:24.356]  Don't forget about the cannibalism factor here.
[02:55:24.356 --> 02:55:29.838]  They are putting us on the pathway to Soylent Green, actual Soylent Green, which is, of course, human burgers.
[02:55:29.838 --> 02:55:39.922]  And remember, they've been talking about human composting for years now, putting that out there, where they want to compost all the dead humans and feed them back into the food gardens.
[02:55:39.922 --> 02:55:41.682]  And now they're talking about cannibalism.
[02:55:41.682 --> 02:55:45.224]  The left-wing media is saying that it's okay to eat fellow human beings.
[02:55:45.224 --> 02:55:46.324]  I mean, gosh, why not?
[02:55:46.324 --> 02:55:48.345]  Their demons are already eating all the babies.
[02:55:48.345 --> 02:55:49.245]  I mean, they're sickos.
[02:55:49.705 --> 02:55:51.567]  But there's nothing they won't push.
[02:55:51.567 --> 02:55:56.832]  But this is, look, they want depopulation, mass death, mass genocide.
[02:55:56.832 --> 02:55:58.974]  And what are they going to do with all that flesh?
[02:55:58.974 --> 02:56:05.200]  Of course, they're going to turn it into their way, way, way beyond anything related to meat.
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:07.162]  It's going to be Soylent Green, man.
[02:56:07.162 --> 02:56:08.363]  It's not science fiction anymore.
[02:56:08.363 --> 02:56:09.004]  That's where they're going.
[02:56:09.605 --> 02:56:25.224]  Look, I mean seriously though, if you put this on a timetable where kids grow up only eating fake beef, never seen a cow, never seen a chicken, men and women don't exist anymore, babies don't even exist anymore, they come from the stork at the hospital or something.
[02:56:25.925 --> 02:56:29.987]  I mean, seriously, on this timeline, we're 50 to 100 years away from that, Mike.
[02:56:29.987 --> 02:56:31.448]  And that's what they want to push.
[02:56:31.448 --> 02:56:42.495]  It's a 1984 psychological brainwashing enslavement of humanity where we're totally detached from everything that made us what we are.
[02:56:42.495 --> 02:56:43.936]  It's demonic.
[02:56:43.936 --> 02:56:46.237]  There are true demons walking among us.
[02:56:46.237 --> 02:56:48.698]  It's not a joke, not a metaphor.
[02:56:48.698 --> 02:56:51.180]  They're trying to turn our world into Sodom and Gomorrah.
[02:56:52.060 --> 02:57:03.062]  And they are hoping that they can destroy everything that is good about humanity, from healthy babies, to logic and reason, to the entire planetary ecosystem.
[02:57:03.062 --> 02:57:05.863]  That is going to be collapsed if they succeed.
[02:57:05.863 --> 02:57:16.565]  Remember the stratospheric aerosol injection, the chemtrailing, the fluoride, the mass pollution, the bio-sludge, putting human waste on food crops, the gender-bender chemicals now being prescribed to children.
[02:57:16.565 --> 02:57:18.406]  It's sick, it is demonic.
[02:57:18.406 --> 02:57:19.546]  That's what's behind all this, Owen.
[02:57:20.691 --> 02:57:24.616]  Let's do five more minutes with Mike Adams before Carpe D'Anthem joins me.
[02:57:24.616 --> 02:57:30.082]  It's just, it is 1984 in the flesh and I don't know Mike, I mean maybe it's something that...
[02:57:31.243 --> 02:57:32.864]  I mean, I just see it in my head, Mike.
[02:57:32.864 --> 02:57:34.424]  I literally see where it's going.
[02:57:34.424 --> 02:57:38.525]  I can doctor-strange this out, and I see where it goes from here.
[02:57:38.525 --> 02:57:51.589]  Children will grow up thinking we saved the planet because we quit eating cows or chickens, and so now they don't exist anymore, and we saved the planet and got rid of bigotry because there's no sexes or genders or babies anymore.
[02:57:51.589 --> 02:57:54.410]  I mean, that's where it goes.
[02:57:54.410 --> 02:57:55.691]  It is now an admitted fact
[02:57:56.627 --> 02:58:04.189]  Fluoride added to the water has caused tens of millions of Americans to be brain damaged and to have infertility and low IQs.
[02:58:04.189 --> 02:58:10.350]  And it doesn't matter if the Journal of American Medical Association comes out and says it's terrible, still the cities put it in the water.
[02:58:10.350 --> 02:58:14.451]  Because the ruling globalists want you and your family poisoned and stupid.
[02:58:14.451 --> 02:58:17.152]  And they sure don't want you to know about the good allergen.
[02:58:17.692 --> 02:58:26.736]  Iodine that absolutely increases IQ and fertility and makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything.
[02:58:26.736 --> 02:58:27.676]  Thank God!
[02:58:27.676 --> 02:58:28.376]  Thank God!
[02:58:28.376 --> 02:58:29.957]  I discovered this eight years ago.
[02:58:29.957 --> 02:58:33.018]  Of course, the enemy knows all about it and they hope you don't discover it.
[02:58:33.018 --> 02:58:34.739]  They hope you just roll over and die.

[02:58:48.524 --> 02:58:49.705]  Just give up America.
[02:58:49.705 --> 02:58:50.685]  Give up Christians.
[02:58:50.685 --> 02:58:52.366]  Drink your fluoride and die!
[02:58:52.366 --> 02:58:53.486]  Give in to Satan!
[02:58:53.486 --> 02:58:55.547]  Give in!

[02:59:01.070 --> 02:59:04.091]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[02:59:04.091 --> 02:59:08.533]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[02:59:08.533 --> 02:59:15.116]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[02:59:15.576 --> 02:59:21.598]  They might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[02:59:21.598 --> 02:59:26.959]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[02:59:26.959 --> 02:59:34.541]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[02:59:34.741 --> 02:59:35.642]  It's that simple.
[02:59:35.642 --> 02:59:41.825]  Find out about the Iodine Conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com and find out why the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[02:59:41.825 --> 02:59:45.628]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research Iodine Deficiency.
[02:59:45.628 --> 02:59:47.569]  It's the key to everything.
[02:59:47.569 --> 02:59:58.215]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality Iodine and BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[02:59:58.215 --> 03:00:00.857]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.595 --> 03:00:12.078]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:00:12.078 --> 03:00:14.660]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:00:14.660 --> 03:00:28.587]  Alright, I just want to get Mike Adams' take on this without me interrupting.
[03:00:28.587 --> 03:00:35.070]  It's just, it's so frustrating because I don't even think I can coherently or eloquently put into words
[03:00:37.170 --> 03:00:47.515]  The vision's in my head for where this goes, Mike, but it's been written in 1984, it's been written in Animal Farm, it's been written by A Brave New World, A Brave New World Revisited.
[03:00:47.515 --> 03:00:58.380]  I mean, so, so, the visions are already out there, and we've already, we've all been through this, we're all connected, Mike, so, so, we're just tapping into that, I guess you could say, because we're healthy individuals that
[03:00:59.634 --> 03:01:08.320]  We have connection to our pineal gland, we have connection to our gut, and the history of our lineage, and so we remember all of that.
[03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:11.103]  But, Mike, we see what they're doing.
[03:01:11.103 --> 03:01:12.904]  Oh, the planet's gonna end in 10 years.
[03:01:12.904 --> 03:01:17.928]  Oh, cows and farmers, they're the problem, so eat fake beef.
[03:01:17.928 --> 03:01:21.790]  You know, oh, there's 76 genders.
[03:01:21.790 --> 03:01:23.171]  Oh, men can have babies.
[03:01:23.171 --> 03:01:24.613]  Men can have periods.
[03:01:24.613 --> 03:01:27.635]  It's all distorting, blurring the lines of reality.
[03:01:28.871 --> 03:01:34.896]  And I'm just trying to envision what is the world going to be like for a kid growing up in 50 years?
[03:01:34.896 --> 03:01:36.798]  And it's not going to be the world.
[03:01:36.798 --> 03:01:44.925]  It's going to be if the leftist trend catches ground and goes global like the plan was, and we don't resist this,
[03:01:45.791 --> 03:01:51.158]  In 50 years, children are not going to hear, they're not going to know anything, what a boy is, what a girl is, what a cow is.
[03:01:51.158 --> 03:01:52.239]  It'll all be demonized.
[03:01:52.239 --> 03:01:53.802]  There'll be no such thing as pregnancies.
[03:01:53.802 --> 03:01:56.285]  I mean, you say, oh, that's extreme.
[03:01:56.285 --> 03:01:57.767]  Well, that's where this goes, Mike.
[03:01:57.767 --> 03:01:58.828]  That's the trend.
[03:01:58.828 --> 03:02:00.130]  These things don't just stop.
[03:02:01.237 --> 03:02:02.998]  They won't even know what human is.
[03:02:02.998 --> 03:02:06.099]  So here's a little snippet of what you're going to see in the near future.
[03:02:06.099 --> 03:02:15.262]  You'll have a woke progressive couple that has a baby and they claim the baby is a panda because pandas are an endangered species.
[03:02:15.262 --> 03:02:20.264]  So they will raise a human boy as a female panda.
[03:02:20.264 --> 03:02:23.705]  So you'll have actual transgender, trans-species children.
[03:02:24.389 --> 03:02:30.972]  Who are raised by progressive parents who think they're saving the world from species extinction.
[03:02:30.972 --> 03:02:33.773]  And what they're doing is, of course, completely insane.
[03:02:33.773 --> 03:02:44.297]  They should be in insane asylums, but they will treat their human child as a panda, and they will feed it like a panda's diet, you know, and they'll have it injected with panda hormones.
[03:02:44.297 --> 03:02:44.977]  You see where I'm going?
[03:02:44.977 --> 03:02:51.640]  This is exactly what's happening right now, just one step further with cross-speciesism, if you will.
[03:02:52.180 --> 03:02:53.561]  That's what's coming.
[03:02:53.561 --> 03:02:58.763]  And if you are opposed to it, Owen, you are an intolerant anti-panda bigot.
[03:02:58.763 --> 03:03:02.465]  Just, by the way, I'm the first to tell you that, by the way.
[03:03:02.465 --> 03:03:03.765]  You are an anti-panda bigot.
[03:03:03.765 --> 03:03:05.406]  I can see it in your future.
[03:03:05.406 --> 03:03:07.807]  You're opposed to turning human babies into pandas.
[03:03:07.807 --> 03:03:09.167]  Shame on you.
[03:03:09.167 --> 03:03:11.508]  But that's kind of what's coming.
[03:03:11.508 --> 03:03:17.411]  And the ones that don't turn into pandas and eagles and field mice and whatever, they will just eat them.
[03:03:18.109 --> 03:03:20.210]  For the non-meat burgers.
[03:03:20.210 --> 03:03:22.132]  So, Soylent Green is coming.
[03:03:22.132 --> 03:03:23.532]  Mass insanity.
[03:03:23.532 --> 03:03:25.113]  Dogs and cats living together.
[03:03:25.113 --> 03:03:25.374]  Right?
[03:03:25.374 --> 03:03:26.054]  Total chaos.
[03:03:26.054 --> 03:03:26.895]  That's what's coming.
[03:03:26.895 --> 03:03:27.975]  It's no joke.
[03:03:27.975 --> 03:03:30.897]  We can make fun of it, but it's really happening.
[03:03:30.897 --> 03:03:31.998]  It's coming, Owen.
[03:03:31.998 --> 03:03:33.379]  And that's the thing, too.
[03:03:33.379 --> 03:03:38.982]  They'll roll out the microchips and make that trendy, and whatever they release to the public won't be the real thing.
[03:03:38.982 --> 03:03:46.127]  You'll just die and get logged into some machine, you know, for your energy or whatever it is.
[03:03:47.148 --> 03:03:56.574]  But Mike, I'm sitting here, I don't know if you... Matt Groening has an unbelievable ability to somehow predict the future in his cartoons.
[03:03:56.574 --> 03:03:58.915]  And hearing you talk about that, I'm thinking about Futurama.
[03:03:58.915 --> 03:04:00.376]  I don't know if you've ever seen it.
[03:04:01.664 --> 03:04:06.671]  You know, there's all these different species on Earth in Futurama in the year 3000.
[03:04:06.671 --> 03:04:16.725]  I'm beginning to think, maybe they're all just human, but they're just cross-species so genetically modified in a thousand years, a human will be such a rare thing, it'll be almost extinct.
[03:04:16.725 --> 03:04:18.207]  You won't even be able to find a human anymore.
[03:04:19.677 --> 03:04:22.081]  Yeah, well, they despise humanity.
[03:04:22.081 --> 03:04:23.403]  This is what's key to understand.
[03:04:23.403 --> 03:04:28.731]  Because they are demonic, they despise any biological being who is created in the image of God.
[03:04:28.731 --> 03:04:34.319]  So this is about destroying life, destroying God, destroying creativity, light, and truth.
[03:04:34.319 --> 03:04:35.821]  Ultimately, this is very philosophical.
[03:04:36.536 --> 03:04:37.457]  But I know you know that.
[03:04:37.457 --> 03:04:41.319]  Yeah, and at a deeper level, Mike, I mean, look, I've only been on this planet 30 years.
[03:04:41.319 --> 03:04:48.603]  I just wonder, how many lines of reality have been distorted on this Earth to get us where we're at now?
[03:04:48.603 --> 03:04:51.384]  Like, I mean, I can't even, I can't even fathom.
[03:04:51.384 --> 03:04:52.305]  I really can't even fathom.
[03:04:52.305 --> 03:04:55.507]  I don't think it's as bad as it could be, but... Alright, Mike, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:04:55.507 --> 03:04:57.188]  Mike Adams, great stuff as always.
[03:04:57.188 --> 03:05:00.750]  You can find his content at bandopvideonaturalnews.com
[03:05:03.291 --> 03:05:05.433]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[03:05:05.433 --> 03:05:08.194]  I'm Wilbur Snakeland.
[03:05:08.194 --> 03:05:29.910]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro to the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[03:05:30.951 --> 03:05:42.901]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad.
[03:05:42.901 --> 03:05:46.244]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[03:05:46.244 --> 03:05:47.445]  There's no medical journals.
[03:05:47.445 --> 03:05:48.926]  There's no facts.
[03:05:48.926 --> 03:05:50.387]  You need fluoride.
[03:05:50.387 --> 03:05:51.268]  Just drink extra
[03:05:53.478 --> 03:05:59.189]  Then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[03:06:14.451 --> 03:06:16.132]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:16.132 --> 03:06:17.852]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:17.852 --> 03:06:19.793]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:19.793 --> 03:06:25.175]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:06:25.175 --> 03:06:29.957]  We're into the fourth and final hour of the Alex Jones Show today.
[03:06:29.957 --> 03:06:32.918]  We're about to be joined by Carpe Donctum.
[03:06:32.918 --> 03:06:34.799]  I'll hop over to the war room to do one hour.
[03:06:36.045 --> 03:06:37.806]  I'm going to be breaking something down.
[03:06:37.806 --> 03:06:38.806]  Very, very important.
[03:06:38.806 --> 03:06:44.209]  You're not going to want to miss that, but you're not going to want to miss Carpe Dankum joining me in just a second either.
[03:06:44.209 --> 03:06:49.331]  And you're really not going to want to miss out on the specials at InfowarsStore.com right now.

[03:08:18.754 --> 03:08:20.434]  Okay.
[03:08:20.434 --> 03:08:23.095]  Carpe Dantum!
[03:08:23.095 --> 03:08:27.896]  Always a pleasure to be joined by Carpe Dantum here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:29.298 --> 03:08:34.342]  And he makes the memes that make the left go bananas.
[03:08:34.342 --> 03:08:38.505]  And so right now, they're obsessing over some meme now, saying it's hateful.
[03:08:38.505 --> 03:08:39.486]  So what is the latest?
[03:08:39.486 --> 03:08:44.189]  What is the latest thought crime you have engaged in, Carpe?
[03:08:44.189 --> 03:08:47.692]  So, uh, the latest thing is, uh, Media Matters.
[03:08:47.692 --> 03:08:51.675]  Uh, Media Matters wrote a hit piece on, um, on Meme World.
[03:08:51.675 --> 03:08:53.876]  Um, they're accusing... Congrats!
[03:08:53.876 --> 03:08:54.076]  Like, wow!
[03:08:54.076 --> 03:08:55.878]  Hey guys, actually, let's give them a round of applause!
[03:08:58.226 --> 03:08:59.246]  Great job!
[03:08:59.246 --> 03:09:01.327]  Great job to MemeWorld.com.
[03:09:01.327 --> 03:09:03.548]  Great job to CarpeDoctum.
[03:09:03.548 --> 03:09:06.529]  Who else makes the memes over there?
[03:09:06.529 --> 03:09:12.432]  You know, we've got Mad Liberals, we've got Soul Memes, we've got Trollosaurus Rex.
[03:09:12.432 --> 03:09:13.873]  Give them all the shouts.
[03:09:13.873 --> 03:09:14.913]  Give them all the love.
[03:09:14.913 --> 03:09:16.434]  Let's see.
[03:09:16.434 --> 03:09:18.374]  We've got Ben Garrison over there.
[03:09:18.374 --> 03:09:18.895]  We've got...
[03:09:20.649 --> 03:09:24.570]  Let's see, Geek Squad, or the Geeks team that got in so much trouble.
[03:09:24.570 --> 03:09:26.591]  I got my stuff, everybody else.
[03:09:26.591 --> 03:09:30.212]  Congratulations to everybody over at memeworld.com for making this possible.
[03:09:30.212 --> 03:09:33.233]  Once you get the Media Matters hit piece, you know you've made it.
[03:09:33.233 --> 03:09:34.453]  Exactly.
[03:09:34.453 --> 03:09:38.714]  If you're not getting attacked by Media Matters, you're not doing your job, is what I say.
[03:09:38.714 --> 03:09:41.375]  Yeah, go harder if you haven't got attacked by Media Matters.
[03:09:42.614 --> 03:10:08.489]  So they're accusing the website of, well, first of all, being filled with violent content, which, I mean, there's some violent content on there, but they're attacking, one of my favorite part of the article is when they talk about how the site is anti-Semitic, because I have a video up there of a rat stealing someone's wallet, and Bernie Sanders' head is put on the rat.
[03:10:08.489 --> 03:10:10.490]  So apparently, since he's Jewish, that's
[03:10:11.471 --> 03:10:14.393]  That's clearly an anti-Semitic trope or whatever.
[03:10:14.393 --> 03:10:21.478]  So it has nothing to do with him being socialist and stealing money from people for himself.
[03:10:21.478 --> 03:10:26.361]  Wait a second, they're the anti-Semites for associating that with Jews.
[03:10:26.361 --> 03:10:26.901]  Exactly.
[03:10:26.901 --> 03:10:32.005]  So that's like Media Matters is anti-Semitic towards Jews.
[03:10:32.005 --> 03:10:32.545]  Apparently.
[03:10:32.545 --> 03:10:36.027]  I mean, like, how else could you take that?
[03:10:36.027 --> 03:10:36.588]  No, seriously.
[03:10:36.588 --> 03:10:36.968]  No, no, no.
[03:10:36.968 --> 03:10:39.490]  Corby, why does Media Matters hate Jewish people?
[03:10:40.547 --> 03:10:41.167]  I don't know.
[03:10:41.167 --> 03:10:45.749]  I mean, I can't see a good reason why they would.
[03:10:45.749 --> 03:10:53.653]  I'm devastated right now by Media Matters' blatant bigotry towards Jewish people to even compare the plights of socialism to Jews.
[03:10:53.653 --> 03:10:54.893]  I'm not mad.
[03:10:54.893 --> 03:10:55.474]  I'm not mad.
[03:10:55.474 --> 03:10:56.814]  I'm just disappointed.
[03:10:56.814 --> 03:10:58.575]  I'm disappointed in Media Matters.
[03:10:58.575 --> 03:11:03.737]  I just have to say that I really thought they were better than this, but apparently not.
[03:11:03.737 --> 03:11:04.878]  Media Matters?
[03:11:04.878 --> 03:11:05.878]  You're better than that.
[03:11:05.878 --> 03:11:06.859]  Your mother used to tell you that.
[03:11:06.859 --> 03:11:07.539]  You're better than that.
[03:11:08.867 --> 03:11:09.868]  Be best.
[03:11:09.868 --> 03:11:11.650]  Be best, Media Matters.
[03:11:11.650 --> 03:11:13.791]  Well, I'm glad we got that out of the way.
[03:11:13.791 --> 03:11:15.273]  So you're not even allowed.
[03:11:15.273 --> 03:11:15.873]  But here's the thing.
[03:11:15.873 --> 03:11:18.775]  See, it's like you said, like, OK, yeah, there's there's some violent content on there.
[03:11:18.775 --> 03:11:20.757]  You're not you're not denying reality.
[03:11:20.757 --> 03:11:23.279]  They put out crap showing Trump getting killed.
[03:11:23.279 --> 03:11:26.462]  It's like an annual ritual for them.
[03:11:26.462 --> 03:11:29.384]  But oh, my God, it's a weekly, weekly ritual.
[03:11:29.384 --> 03:11:31.626]  It's it's not annual, but they deny it.
[03:11:31.626 --> 03:11:32.627]  They act like they don't do it.
[03:11:33.914 --> 03:11:39.579]  Right, I mean, last week we had, uh, I think there was two really solid instances.
[03:11:39.579 --> 03:11:47.946]  One was, uh, um... Oh, uh, Tom... Nancy Pelosi's, uh, high-heeled shoe.
[03:11:47.946 --> 03:11:57.974]  Right, and then Tom, Tom Arnold, uh, was talking about the JFK assassinations... Oh, Hillary Clinton also sent that fake JFK letter?
[03:11:58.769 --> 03:12:07.893]  Right, but well, Thomas was worse because he was like, people showed up for JFK too, and you know, this is when Trump is in Dallas.
[03:12:07.893 --> 03:12:11.235]  Seriously, you know, Tom Arnold, I almost feel like we should say a prayer.
[03:12:11.235 --> 03:12:15.237]  I mean, heroin or whatever this guy's on, he needs help.
[03:12:15.237 --> 03:12:16.658]  He does, he really does need help.
[03:12:16.658 --> 03:12:21.360]  Yeah, see, what you're showing right now, this is anti-Semitism, and now you're guilty of it too.
[03:12:22.668 --> 03:12:23.748]  I get it though.
[03:12:23.748 --> 03:12:24.289]  I get it.
[03:12:24.289 --> 03:12:25.289]  But that's the funny thing.
[03:12:25.289 --> 03:12:32.531]  It's Media Matters that sees this and they think, wow, you just depicted a Jew going into your purse and stealing a dollar.
[03:12:32.531 --> 03:12:34.291]  Right.
[03:12:34.291 --> 03:12:36.612]  But really, it's a socialist.
[03:12:36.612 --> 03:12:39.093]  The title even says socialist.
[03:12:39.093 --> 03:12:44.114]  It's not like it even... Like if we were trying to be anti-Semitic, it would say, Jew steals money or something.
[03:12:44.114 --> 03:12:45.414]  Like, what is this?
[03:12:45.414 --> 03:12:47.155]  Let's say you even did do that.
[03:12:47.155 --> 03:12:47.635]  So what?
[03:12:49.921 --> 03:12:54.084]  Socialist Bernie Sanders will steal your money right out of your purse.
[03:12:54.084 --> 03:12:55.425]  You can't make jokes anymore?
[03:12:55.425 --> 03:12:56.866]  No, and he can't.
[03:12:56.866 --> 03:12:58.067]  He can't.
[03:12:58.067 --> 03:13:01.669]  You know who does a lot of good Jew jokes?
[03:13:01.669 --> 03:13:03.451]  Who's that?
[03:13:03.451 --> 03:13:05.392]  South Park?
[03:13:05.392 --> 03:13:07.754]  Oh God, we're back to that already.
[03:13:07.754 --> 03:13:10.736]  Before we do that, I want to show you this.
[03:13:10.736 --> 03:13:13.738]  A friend of mine made this.
[03:13:13.738 --> 03:13:16.660]  Meme America great again.
[03:13:16.660 --> 03:13:17.621]  That's what we're going to do.
[03:13:18.925 --> 03:13:20.927]  Is that a new hat you've made?
[03:13:20.927 --> 03:13:23.789]  It's a brick suit made it.
[03:13:23.789 --> 03:13:25.170]  Have you seen that guy?
[03:13:25.170 --> 03:13:30.915]  He runs around, goes to Trump rallies, and he wears this suit that looks like a brick wall.
[03:13:30.915 --> 03:13:32.216]  I don't think I have.
[03:13:32.216 --> 03:13:34.838]  I'm surprised, but I don't believe I have.
[03:13:34.838 --> 03:13:38.261]  At some point, he was up on stage with Trump.
[03:13:38.261 --> 03:13:39.262]  Oh, sometime in the last year.
[03:13:39.262 --> 03:13:42.005]  But anyway, he's one of the contributors at the site, too.
[03:13:43.234 --> 03:13:44.756]  Hey, what do you think about this?
[03:13:44.756 --> 03:13:47.739]  You've already been targeted by the left.
[03:13:47.739 --> 03:13:48.820]  Have you seen this new thing?
[03:13:48.820 --> 03:13:53.946]  They've launched a website now where they're literally doxing people publicly.
[03:13:53.946 --> 03:13:55.948]  Oh, I know.
[03:13:55.948 --> 03:13:56.889]  You've seen this?
[03:13:56.889 --> 03:13:57.509]  I've seen it.
[03:13:57.509 --> 03:13:57.950]  I've seen it.
[03:13:57.950 --> 03:13:59.011]  It's insane.
[03:13:59.011 --> 03:14:00.653]  I was just talking to Jack about that yesterday.
[03:14:02.739 --> 03:14:12.043]  Like, I think we're all surprised that it took this long for them to make a website where they just, you know, blatantly dox anybody that's ever donated to Trump.
[03:14:12.043 --> 03:14:13.984]  Well, it's been in the works for a while.
[03:14:13.984 --> 03:14:22.427]  I think that right now the Democrats are so desperate now, and really their plans have actually been exposed so many times, I think they've been putting it off.
[03:14:22.427 --> 03:14:29.390]  But you had Obama at the Soros fundraiser yesterday, the same day they announced their website, so it's all very coordinated.
[03:14:30.396 --> 03:14:35.638]  Yeah, he was at Alex Soros or whatever, his fundraiser.
[03:14:35.638 --> 03:14:36.838]  Yeah, he's there.
[03:14:36.838 --> 03:14:45.021]  It's Alex Soros, Terry McAuliffe, Eric Holder, and so they're all at the Soros fundraiser.
[03:14:45.021 --> 03:14:46.301]  Do you know what the fundraiser was for?
[03:14:49.125 --> 03:14:50.247]  Evil and bigotry?
[03:14:50.247 --> 03:14:50.567]  I don't know.
[03:14:50.567 --> 03:14:51.608]  No, no, no, but get this.
[03:14:51.608 --> 03:14:54.392]  It's for redistricting New York.
[03:14:54.392 --> 03:14:58.957]  So why do McAuliffe or Holder or Obama even have any interest in that?
[03:14:58.957 --> 03:14:59.758]  So there's something else.
[03:14:59.758 --> 03:15:02.762]  Why would you need to redistrict New York?
[03:15:02.762 --> 03:15:03.643]  There's something else.
[03:15:03.643 --> 03:15:06.006]  Well, the Democrats are constantly engaged in gerrymandering.
[03:15:07.413 --> 03:15:10.694]  I mean, they have solid control over New York.
[03:15:10.694 --> 03:15:12.135]  I don't even know why they would need to bother.
[03:15:12.135 --> 03:15:16.977]  Maybe they're afraid of Trump getting some New York votes or something.
[03:15:16.977 --> 03:15:20.038]  Or maybe they're trying to keep AOC in office by redistricting.
[03:15:20.038 --> 03:15:20.678]  I don't know.
[03:15:20.678 --> 03:15:22.439]  The point is, I don't think that's really what it's about.
[03:15:22.439 --> 03:15:24.379]  I think that's a front.
[03:15:24.379 --> 03:15:25.840]  Yeah.
[03:15:25.840 --> 03:15:31.722]  To have Obama and Holder and McAuliffe there for redistricting of New York, it doesn't add up to me.
[03:15:32.401 --> 03:15:39.122]  You know, we're not allowed to have this conversation right now because this is an anti-Semitic conversation because George Soros is Jewish.
[03:15:39.122 --> 03:15:41.163]  Oh my gosh, that's true.
[03:15:41.163 --> 03:15:43.863]  So, I mean, you've just completely just killed the show.
[03:15:43.863 --> 03:15:47.784]  Hold on guys, show that picture again with Obama and Soros.
[03:15:47.784 --> 03:15:48.704]  This is unbelievable.
[03:15:48.704 --> 03:15:49.625]  Look at this.
[03:15:49.625 --> 03:15:50.865]  Two white guys.
[03:15:50.865 --> 03:15:53.945]  Two white guys meeting in New York.
[03:15:53.945 --> 03:15:56.306]  And now it's a racist show.
[03:15:56.306 --> 03:15:59.367]  No, no, look, there's two white guys right there to redistrict New York.
[03:15:59.367 --> 03:16:00.567]  I'm sick of these white guys.
[03:16:00.567 --> 03:16:01.287]  I'm sick of all of them.
[03:16:02.281 --> 03:16:03.501]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:03.501 --> 03:16:07.422]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:07.422 --> 03:16:08.962]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:08.962 --> 03:16:11.923]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:11.923 --> 03:16:17.464]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:17.464 --> 03:16:18.684]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:18.684 --> 03:16:21.605]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:21.605 --> 03:16:23.825]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:23.825 --> 03:16:28.266]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:28.266 --> 03:16:30.567]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:31.787 --> 03:16:38.132]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:38.132 --> 03:16:41.174]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:41.174 --> 03:16:47.099]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:47.099 --> 03:16:50.882]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:50.882 --> 03:16:52.163]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:52.163 --> 03:16:53.504]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:53.504 --> 03:16:59.709]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:59.709 --> 03:17:01.130]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:07.115]  One of the most frequently asked questions we get in customer service is, what is the Real Red Pill?
[03:17:07.115 --> 03:17:09.237]  And what is the Real Red Pill Plus?
[03:17:09.237 --> 03:17:15.142]  Well, Real Red Pill is a vitamin, mineral, multivitamin, high quality with preglanone.
[03:17:15.142 --> 03:17:21.488]  Real Red Pill Plus is the same thing with a little bit of clean added energy on top of it as well.
[03:17:21.488 --> 03:17:23.149]  That kicks in in 30 minutes.
[03:17:23.149 --> 03:17:26.352]  But the preglanone kicks in in about a week or so.
[03:17:27.313 --> 03:17:29.455]  Folks, look into preglanone for yourself.
[03:17:29.455 --> 03:17:39.844]  Look into high-end sources of it, like Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus, and then you'll definitely want to try it out and see the effects you get within about seven days to two weeks, generally.
[03:17:39.844 --> 03:17:41.786]  But believe me, it's a missing link.
[03:17:41.786 --> 03:17:42.827]  You need to find out about it.
[03:17:43.587 --> 03:17:45.689]  As we age, preglanone levels go down.
[03:17:45.689 --> 03:17:49.873]  All of our hormones in our body are manufactured by the body using preglanone.
[03:17:49.873 --> 03:17:56.359]  You need to learn about preglanone and then you need to get the Real Red Pill or the Real Red Pill Plus.

[03:18:03.405 --> 03:18:04.666]  It is now an admitted fact.
[03:18:05.586 --> 03:18:13.148]  Fluoride added to the water has caused tens of millions of Americans to be brain damaged and to have infertility and low IQs.
[03:18:13.148 --> 03:18:19.329]  And it doesn't matter if the Journal of American Medical Association comes out and says it's terrible, still the city's put it in the water.
[03:18:19.329 --> 03:18:23.410]  Because the ruling globalists want you and your family poisoned and stupid.
[03:18:23.410 --> 03:18:26.111]  And they sure don't want you to know about the good allergen.
[03:18:26.651 --> 03:18:35.695]  Iodine that absolutely increases IQ and fertility and makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything.
[03:18:35.695 --> 03:18:36.635]  Thank God!
[03:18:36.635 --> 03:18:37.335]  Thank God!
[03:18:37.335 --> 03:18:38.676]  I discovered this eight years ago.
[03:18:38.676 --> 03:18:41.977]  Of course, the enemy knows all about it, and they hope you don't discover it.
[03:18:41.977 --> 03:18:43.698]  They hope you just roll over and die.

[03:18:57.484 --> 03:18:58.665]  Just give up, America.
[03:18:58.665 --> 03:18:59.646]  Give up, Christians.
[03:18:59.646 --> 03:19:01.348]  Drink your fluoride and die!
[03:19:01.348 --> 03:19:02.469]  Give in to Satan!
[03:19:02.469 --> 03:19:03.310]  Give in!
[03:19:03.310 --> 03:19:06.893]  InfoWars presents Alex Jones.
[03:19:06.893 --> 03:19:13.339]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious came out
[03:19:13.539 --> 03:19:16.303]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water.
[03:19:28.641 --> 03:19:32.084]  In places like California, unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[03:19:32.084 --> 03:19:38.789]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you!
[03:19:38.789 --> 03:19:40.710]  And they want to sexualize your children!
[03:19:40.710 --> 03:19:47.115]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:47.115 --> 03:19:49.677]  Drink fluoride and die!
[03:19:49.677 --> 03:19:52.999]  Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over!
[03:19:52.999 --> 03:19:56.382]  Do not visit Infowarsstore.com and get high quality iodine to counter it.
[03:19:56.522 --> 03:19:56.843]  No!
[03:19:56.843 --> 03:19:59.286]  Roll over and die, dirty Americans!
[03:19:59.286 --> 03:20:06.136]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:20:06.136 --> 03:20:08.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:27.296 --> 03:20:28.876]  And gals.
[03:20:28.876 --> 03:20:30.497]  Must not discriminate.
[03:20:30.497 --> 03:20:34.057]  And all the other 95,000 genders.
[03:20:34.057 --> 03:20:37.538]  Halloween is coming up.
[03:20:37.538 --> 03:20:38.898]  Have you got your costume yet?
[03:20:38.898 --> 03:20:45.820]  If not, we've got your costume at Infowarsstore.com.

[03:20:52.221 --> 03:20:53.081]  Imagine.
[03:20:53.081 --> 03:20:56.822]  Imagine how scared your liberal neighbors will be when you show up dressed as Alex Jones.
[03:20:58.220 --> 03:20:59.681]  They might lock their doors and hide.
[03:20:59.681 --> 03:21:02.982]  You'll never see them again.
[03:21:02.982 --> 03:21:07.844]  So, get your Halloween costume from InfoWarsStore.com, the Alex Jones mask.
[03:21:07.844 --> 03:21:11.246]  Ladies and gentlemen, be Alex Jones for Halloween.
[03:21:11.246 --> 03:21:14.788]  What will scare your liberal neighbors more?
[03:21:14.788 --> 03:21:16.789]  InfoWarsStore.com, everything must go to sale.
[03:21:16.789 --> 03:21:17.329]  Check it out.
[03:21:17.329 --> 03:21:20.110]  Alright, Carpe Dantum, meme legend.
[03:21:20.110 --> 03:21:21.291]  I've got to just do this on air.
[03:21:21.291 --> 03:21:22.331]  I'm going to be that guy.
[03:21:22.331 --> 03:21:23.892]  Can I be that guy for a segment, Carpe?
[03:21:25.742 --> 03:21:26.783]  Go ahead and be that guy.
[03:21:26.783 --> 03:21:27.824]  I gotta be that guy.
[03:21:27.824 --> 03:21:31.527]  He already knows that guy because he deals with that guy all the time.
[03:21:31.527 --> 03:21:35.690]  Guys, I've got a new meme idea for Carpe Doctum.
[03:21:35.690 --> 03:21:39.773]  So the Democrats are all panicked over this lynching comment.
[03:21:39.773 --> 03:21:42.735]  There's a whole ABC News thread.
[03:21:42.735 --> 03:21:49.721]  It's like 30 tweets long of all the Republicans and Democrats and all these people disavowing Trump's lynching comment.
[03:21:49.721 --> 03:21:53.163]  So there's memes galore to be made, I think, here.
[03:21:53.163 --> 03:21:54.404]  But I've got the meme for you.
[03:21:54.404 --> 03:21:54.825]  Are you ready?
[03:21:56.465 --> 03:21:57.406]  I'm so ready.
[03:21:57.406 --> 03:21:58.447]  I'm going to be that guy.
[03:21:58.447 --> 03:21:59.508]  I know you love this.
[03:21:59.508 --> 03:22:01.810]  It's your favorite part of the day.
[03:22:01.810 --> 03:22:09.415]  So I don't know if you've seen the movie The Ridiculous Six, but there's a scene where Taylor Lautner's character is being lynched and they can't kill him.
[03:22:09.415 --> 03:22:16.481]  And so he's literally swinging from the noose, dancing, doing the running man, laughing, having a good time.
[03:22:16.481 --> 03:22:20.263]  So I think, play the video, you put Trump's face
[03:22:21.204 --> 03:22:30.474]  On Taylor Lautner's character and then you have Pelosi and Schumer and Schiff all next to him doing the hanging and Brennan and so there's Trump right there.
[03:22:30.474 --> 03:22:39.123]  He's laughing, having a good time and Schiff pulls the lever and all the Democrats and media cheer and they're all happy and oh my gosh, they got Trump!
[03:22:39.844 --> 03:22:42.547]  Except no, he's laughing.
[03:22:42.547 --> 03:22:43.789]  They can't get him.
[03:22:43.789 --> 03:22:44.630]  And so now they're shocked.
[03:22:44.630 --> 03:22:46.052]  They're like, what's going on here?
[03:22:46.052 --> 03:22:47.814]  And then Trump does a dance.
[03:22:47.814 --> 03:22:49.616]  He's making jokes.
[03:22:49.616 --> 03:22:51.879]  And the media doesn't know what to do.
[03:22:51.879 --> 03:22:54.382]  The Democrats don't know what to do.
[03:22:54.382 --> 03:22:55.023]  So there you go.
[03:22:55.023 --> 03:22:56.725]  So I just was that guy.
[03:22:56.725 --> 03:22:57.646]  Now Trump's swinging.
[03:22:57.646 --> 03:22:58.327]  Go back, guys.
[03:22:58.327 --> 03:22:58.947]  What are you doing?
[03:22:59.793 --> 03:23:06.855]  Now you see Trump swinging, having a good time with the political lynching, showing them his karate moves.
[03:23:06.855 --> 03:23:07.475]  So there you go.
[03:23:07.475 --> 03:23:13.337]  So that's just a meme idea for you there from the Ridiculous Six.
[03:23:13.337 --> 03:23:14.638]  I will consider that.
[03:23:14.638 --> 03:23:17.199]  I was just that guy.
[03:23:17.199 --> 03:23:22.580]  And if I ever want to be banned from social media, I will definitely do that.
[03:23:22.580 --> 03:23:24.401]  It depicts Trump being hung!
[03:23:24.401 --> 03:23:26.682]  That'll be promoted!
[03:23:26.682 --> 03:23:27.002]  You know what?
[03:23:28.416 --> 03:23:31.217]  They would be the type that would come after me because of that.
[03:23:31.217 --> 03:23:34.018]  They'd be like, oh, this is an incitement of violence against Trump.
[03:23:34.018 --> 03:23:35.519]  Just because they know it would get me in trouble.
[03:23:35.519 --> 03:23:38.780]  But that gives you even more reason to do it.
[03:23:38.780 --> 03:23:40.201]  I will look at it very seriously.
[03:23:40.201 --> 03:23:41.302]  Do you see what I just did here?
[03:23:41.302 --> 03:23:48.525]  I just put so much pressure on him live on air, and now if he doesn't take my meme, like, oh my gosh, does he hate me?
[03:23:48.525 --> 03:23:49.465]  Is he even my friend?
[03:23:49.465 --> 03:23:54.507]  I'm pretty sure if I don't do the meme, it means I'm not your friend.
[03:23:54.507 --> 03:23:55.468]  I think that's what that means.
[03:23:57.017 --> 03:23:58.938]  Well, I'll be very... I'm feeling the pressure.
[03:23:58.938 --> 03:24:00.799]  I mean, I'm sweating bullets over here.
[03:24:00.799 --> 03:24:01.439]  Oh my God.
[03:24:01.439 --> 03:24:04.200]  It'll be like a lynching if you don't do it.
[03:24:04.200 --> 03:24:07.742]  Yeah, I will be lynched if I don't do it.
[03:24:07.742 --> 03:24:08.882]  Here's the amazing thing, though.
[03:24:08.882 --> 03:24:14.004]  Again, they are the ones who are engaging in violence.
[03:24:14.004 --> 03:24:16.385]  They are the ones now doxing people.
[03:24:16.385 --> 03:24:18.926]  Of course, they all brag about how they doxed you.
[03:24:18.926 --> 03:24:20.147]  Everybody loves to do that now.
[03:24:20.147 --> 03:24:21.847]  It's like a scalp to them, right?
[03:24:21.847 --> 03:24:22.888]  It's like, ah-ha-ha!
[03:24:22.888 --> 03:24:23.508]  We got him!
[03:24:23.508 --> 03:24:25.189]  And they hold up your name like it's a scalp.
[03:24:26.201 --> 03:24:26.621]  Right.
[03:24:26.621 --> 03:24:28.663]  Kathy Griffin did it the other day.
[03:24:28.663 --> 03:24:34.147]  She said she was going to come to... She was going to see me in Kansas City or something.
[03:24:34.147 --> 03:24:35.788]  I don't know.
[03:24:35.788 --> 03:24:37.350]  What?
[03:24:37.350 --> 03:24:39.491]  Yeah, Kathy Griffin.
[03:24:39.491 --> 03:24:44.475]  She was mad about the Kingsman video.
[03:24:44.475 --> 03:24:47.858]  And someone said that I made it.
[03:24:47.858 --> 03:24:50.640]  And then they said my name.
[03:24:50.640 --> 03:24:53.162]  So she called out my name and said something about
[03:24:54.691 --> 03:24:58.192]  Seeing me in Kansas City sooner rather than later or something like that.
[03:24:58.192 --> 03:24:58.472]  I don't know.
[03:24:58.472 --> 03:25:00.332]  It was crazy.
[03:25:00.332 --> 03:25:03.773]  Maybe she's going there for the barbecue.
[03:25:03.773 --> 03:25:04.754]  I kind of doubt it.
[03:25:04.754 --> 03:25:14.236]  This is the same lady who holds up, who physically did a photo shoot with a decapitated Trump head, who's triggered over a cartoon?
[03:25:14.236 --> 03:25:16.577]  No, she was mad.
[03:25:16.577 --> 03:25:20.498]  She's mad because she's actually in the video, I think.
[03:25:20.498 --> 03:25:21.638]  Oh, you know what, Carb-
[03:25:22.918 --> 03:25:24.539]  I think it's time for us to go next level.
[03:25:24.539 --> 03:25:27.141]  Are you ready for this?
[03:25:27.141 --> 03:25:30.483]  Even more next level than the last next level we just did?
[03:25:30.483 --> 03:25:31.403]  Yeah.
[03:25:31.403 --> 03:25:32.404]  Okay, I'm ready.
[03:25:32.404 --> 03:25:34.365]  In fact, we're actually like skipping two levels.
[03:25:34.365 --> 03:25:35.826]  We're going into like warp zone here.
[03:25:35.826 --> 03:25:48.334]  I think it's time for us, live on the Alex Jones Show, to disavow all Looney Tunes because they depict violence against animals.
[03:25:48.334 --> 03:25:51.897]  They depict violence against animals of color.
[03:25:53.980 --> 03:26:08.926]  And so I think it's time for us to disavow Looney Tunes, disavow Warner Brothers, and this is just the beginning, but I disavow Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck and Yosemite Sam and Marvin the Martian and Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner.
[03:26:08.926 --> 03:26:12.508]  There's so much bigotry and discrimination and violence in Looney Tunes.
[03:26:12.508 --> 03:26:14.269]  I disavow.
[03:26:14.269 --> 03:26:16.950]  I disavow as well, but I want to go a step further.
[03:26:16.950 --> 03:26:19.251]  I believe that Wile E. Coyote
[03:26:20.429 --> 03:26:22.994]  Uh, and the Roadrunner is a racist cartoon.
[03:26:22.994 --> 03:26:26.863]  It's, it's obviously, I mean, the coyote... Don't even get me started on Speedy Gonzales!
[03:26:27.615 --> 03:26:30.598]  Speedy Gonzales, well clearly, clearly.
[03:26:30.598 --> 03:26:39.826]  But Wiley, all of the violence is directed towards people of color or animals of color, whatever they may be.
[03:26:39.826 --> 03:26:46.292]  So yeah, I totally disavow all Warner Brothers products and all cartoons, including the ones that I've got.
[03:26:46.292 --> 03:26:49.574]  The crew also just pointed me, how about the bigotry with Pepe Le Pew?
[03:26:49.574 --> 03:26:52.257]  Like every French person is a serial rapist?
[03:26:53.797 --> 03:26:54.297]  Exactly.
[03:26:54.297 --> 03:26:55.657]  It's unbelievable.
[03:26:55.657 --> 03:27:01.918]  Can you imagine the womanization of a Pepe Le Pew?
[03:27:01.918 --> 03:27:05.219]  I think Pepe Le Pew is one of the craziest things.
[03:27:05.219 --> 03:27:05.519]  Don't laugh!
[03:27:05.519 --> 03:27:07.039]  You think this is funny?
[03:27:07.039 --> 03:27:11.300]  Are you laughing at the abuse of Pepe Le Pew?
[03:27:11.300 --> 03:27:18.341]  I'm thinking back to my childhood watching those cartoons.
[03:27:18.341 --> 03:27:20.282]  How did those cartoons even make it on the air?
[03:27:20.282 --> 03:27:21.962]  Think about Foghorn and Leghorn.
[03:27:23.759 --> 03:27:27.262]  Like, he scares that cat to death every single time.
[03:27:27.262 --> 03:27:29.683]  Like, that cat is, like, terrified of him.
[03:27:29.683 --> 03:27:31.584]  No, but you're right!
[03:27:31.584 --> 03:27:36.007]  These cartoons wouldn't even be allowed on television in this day and age.
[03:27:36.007 --> 03:27:36.527]  Right.
[03:27:36.527 --> 03:27:37.888]  And they're, like, the greatest ever!
[03:27:37.888 --> 03:27:42.031]  Like, it's well known, like, the Looney Tunes broke ground for cartoons.
[03:27:42.031 --> 03:27:42.531]  Oh, yeah.
[03:27:42.531 --> 03:27:44.012]  I mean, yeah.
[03:27:44.012 --> 03:27:52.538]  The Bugs Bunny ones are usually my favorite, but just thinking back on some of them, man, times have changed just a little bit since then.
[03:27:53.781 --> 03:28:00.525]  I feel that the depiction of Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam is racist against white people.
[03:28:00.525 --> 03:28:01.446]  Oh, what?
[03:28:01.446 --> 03:28:02.327]  Hold on.
[03:28:02.327 --> 03:28:03.367]  This is a real story.
[03:28:03.367 --> 03:28:04.348]  They just found it.
[03:28:04.348 --> 03:28:08.290]  Exploring the hidden racist past of Looney Tunes.
[03:28:08.290 --> 03:28:10.752]  I didn't even know this was out there.
[03:28:10.752 --> 03:28:11.432]  Oh, I'm sure.
[03:28:11.432 --> 03:28:15.755]  Yeah, that doesn't surprise me at all.
[03:28:15.755 --> 03:28:17.056]  Now listen, boy.
[03:28:17.056 --> 03:28:18.377]  Now listen good, boy.
[03:28:19.306 --> 03:28:23.217]  I've never heard of a boy that doesn't know how to play baseball, son!
[03:28:25.743 --> 03:28:27.744]  Gender stereotypes.
[03:28:27.744 --> 03:28:28.904]  It's a killer, man.
[03:28:28.904 --> 03:28:29.705]  That's it!
[03:28:29.705 --> 03:28:35.267]  Seriously, like, I'll play a... We should almost just play a Looney Tunes cartoon and just, like, break down all the bigotry.
[03:28:35.267 --> 03:28:36.048]  Let's do a breakdown.
[03:28:36.048 --> 03:28:41.690]  I want to get your take, not to go back to South Park, but here we go, back to South Park.
[03:28:41.690 --> 03:28:46.412]  I want to get your take on the first three episodes or four episodes of... It's been brilliant.
[03:28:46.412 --> 03:28:47.673]  Let's do that.
[03:28:47.673 --> 03:28:54.596]  And, you know, I just want to diss about Looney Tunes, too, for having the first gay frog ever on air, dancing about like a dandy.
[03:28:55.457 --> 03:28:57.341]  Singing show tunes?
[03:28:57.341 --> 03:29:00.950]  I mean, to stereotype gay frogs like that is just rude.
[03:29:02.421 --> 03:29:04.381]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:29:04.381 --> 03:29:09.683]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:29:09.683 --> 03:29:11.283]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:29:11.283 --> 03:29:19.625]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:19.625 --> 03:29:25.306]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:29:25.486 --> 03:29:27.308]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:29:27.308 --> 03:29:29.470]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:29.470 --> 03:29:33.975]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:29:33.975 --> 03:29:36.177]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:29:36.177 --> 03:29:43.925]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:30:03.183 --> 03:30:14.388]  Again, I'm not talking down to the InfoWars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride, and I'm talking about iodine.
[03:30:14.388 --> 03:30:24.512]  Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an old Blastron boat, and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[03:30:24.512 --> 03:30:26.833]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live.
[03:30:27.836 --> 03:30:29.398]  Okay, it's the same thing.
[03:30:29.398 --> 03:30:32.462]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride.
[03:30:32.462 --> 03:30:35.166]  That's why, in every western nation, they put it in the water.
[03:30:35.166 --> 03:30:37.469]  They're gonna teach us Christians to lay down and die.
[03:30:37.469 --> 03:30:39.311]  The Chai Kams don't put it in the water.
[03:30:39.311 --> 03:30:40.813]  They'd execute you if you did that.
[03:30:40.813 --> 03:30:42.416]  They'd put iodine in the water,
[03:30:42.756 --> 03:30:48.779]  Because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else.
[03:30:48.779 --> 03:30:52.700]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at Infowarstore.com.
[03:30:52.700 --> 03:30:54.641]  We have all the documents and articles linked.
[03:30:54.641 --> 03:30:59.043]  And then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[03:30:59.043 --> 03:31:04.665]  Again, get iodine at Infowarstore.com.
[03:31:04.665 --> 03:31:06.406]  Here are the facts.
[03:31:07.700 --> 03:31:16.790]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies including the American Medical Journal.
[03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:23.217]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility.
[03:31:23.217 --> 03:31:24.419]  That's the facts.
[03:31:24.419 --> 03:31:24.599]  Learn
[03:31:25.766 --> 03:31:26.567]  I don't know.
[03:31:53.282 --> 03:32:15.028]  Hello today on All Things Considered, I'm Wilbur Snakely here to tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[03:32:15.028 --> 03:32:18.809]  Now sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that
[03:32:19.329 --> 03:32:25.073]  It's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[03:32:25.073 --> 03:32:25.993]  That's right.
[03:32:25.993 --> 03:32:27.894]  Drink the fluoride.
[03:32:27.894 --> 03:32:32.237]  Don't visit Infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen.
[03:32:32.237 --> 03:32:33.678]  I mean the bad halogen.
[03:32:33.678 --> 03:32:34.398]  Iodine.
[03:32:34.398 --> 03:32:37.180]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[03:32:37.920 --> 03:32:44.366]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us.
[03:32:44.366 --> 03:32:46.028]  We don't want to compete with you.
[03:32:46.028 --> 03:32:48.691]  Just drink the fluoride.
[03:32:48.691 --> 03:32:52.454]  Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do.
[03:32:52.454 --> 03:32:54.616]  Don't support Alex Jones.
[03:32:54.616 --> 03:32:59.040]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal.
[03:32:59.040 --> 03:33:01.182]  Oh, and let Nambla have access to your children.
[03:33:05.610 --> 03:33:08.181]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.455 --> 03:33:25.678]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:33:25.678 --> 03:33:30.363]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.

[03:34:22.491 --> 03:34:27.255]  Alright, Carpe, we were just calling out the blatant bigotry of Looney Tunes cartoons.
[03:34:27.255 --> 03:34:27.936]  I mean, how dare you?
[03:34:27.936 --> 03:34:28.436]  Yes.
[03:34:28.436 --> 03:34:29.397]  If you're Looney Tunes.
[03:34:29.397 --> 03:34:31.899]  But you had a question for me, so go ahead.
[03:34:33.542 --> 03:34:39.624]  Oh, my question was just what you thought of the first three or four episodes of South Park.
[03:34:39.624 --> 03:34:42.645]  They've been going after China really hard.
[03:34:42.645 --> 03:34:47.647]  The last one, Let Them Eat Goo, is that the fourth or third episode?
[03:34:47.647 --> 03:34:48.807]  I feel like it's the fourth.
[03:34:48.807 --> 03:34:49.427]  I think it's the fourth.
[03:34:49.427 --> 03:34:50.448]  Okay, yeah, the crew.
[03:34:50.448 --> 03:34:59.571]  I gotta say, South Park has always been ahead of its time, but now it's reached this weird
[03:35:00.990 --> 03:35:04.411]  Crucible, where it used to be they're like 10 years ahead of their time.
[03:35:04.411 --> 03:35:07.172]  Now they're like 10 minutes ahead of their time.
[03:35:07.172 --> 03:35:07.432]  Right.
[03:35:07.432 --> 03:35:12.333]  And it's like they put out an episode and then reality follows almost immediately.
[03:35:12.333 --> 03:35:14.634]  We saw that with the China episodes.
[03:35:14.634 --> 03:35:18.936]  So to me, it's really just that South Park is doing what South Park has always done.
[03:35:18.936 --> 03:35:29.439]  It's just either they're so good or they're so keyed in on being ahead of their time that they've narrowed their linear scale to being immediate.
[03:35:30.819 --> 03:35:39.382]  It's like they told the story of America, like before it happened, and they're finally catching up with it now.
[03:35:39.382 --> 03:35:40.122]  You know what I mean?
[03:35:40.122 --> 03:35:42.602]  And I love the fact they have no fear.
[03:35:42.602 --> 03:35:46.043]  And they're really, they're kind of like the whole too big to fail notion.
[03:35:46.043 --> 03:35:47.864]  I mean, you can't get rid of South Park.
[03:35:47.864 --> 03:35:49.684]  It's way too popular.
[03:35:49.684 --> 03:35:55.666]  And I guess they just love, they still love doing it enough to keep making new content that is just incredible.
[03:35:55.666 --> 03:35:57.787]  But I think the Let Them Eat Goo episode,
[03:35:58.689 --> 03:36:12.700]  That this one might take a little bit longer to age but but it's it's it they nailed it and all these people that are promoting these uh meatless burgers need to see that episode and and maybe get a little taste of what they're actually eating.
[03:36:12.700 --> 03:36:19.205]  Right yeah I like uh I I like the part where he's uh
[03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:23.691]  He says, this tastes awful.
[03:36:23.691 --> 03:36:24.091]  This tastes awful.
[03:36:24.091 --> 03:36:25.691]  And he's like, wait for it, wait for it.
[03:36:25.691 --> 03:36:30.112]  And he's like, oh, tastes good.
[03:36:30.112 --> 03:36:31.212]  The Tegrity Burger?
[03:36:31.212 --> 03:36:32.492]  Yeah, the Tegrity Burger.
[03:36:32.492 --> 03:36:33.333]  Oh, man.
[03:36:33.333 --> 03:36:35.893]  They've gone so hard against China.
[03:36:35.893 --> 03:36:39.614]  And I think it's great.
[03:36:39.614 --> 03:36:42.574]  They've had some shocking moments, like where Randy
[03:36:45.965 --> 03:36:48.388]  Randy kills Pooh Bear.
[03:36:48.388 --> 03:36:51.030]  I mean, that was just over the top.
[03:36:51.030 --> 03:36:51.831]  I need some honey.
[03:36:51.831 --> 03:36:56.115]  There's a jar of honey sitting in an alley.
[03:36:56.115 --> 03:36:57.957]  Right, right.
[03:36:57.957 --> 03:37:08.388]  But again, South Park, it's like, that's what I'm saying, it's like South Park called out China the minute before calling out China became a crime in the NBA.
[03:37:09.369 --> 03:37:09.629]  Right.
[03:37:09.629 --> 03:37:09.769]  Right.
[03:37:24.062 --> 03:37:30.927]  They've been very prophetic in the past, and I think this is just another one of those things.
[03:37:30.927 --> 03:37:41.094]  I think it's funny also that they've made this whole side plot of the Tegrity Farms thing, going after the fight between marijuana growers and big
[03:37:45.791 --> 03:37:46.051]  Marijuana!
[03:38:04.571 --> 03:38:14.877]  So no one else, you know what the thing is though, and it's almost like South Park has an obligation to stick around because no one else is allowed, South Park is grandfathered into making these jokes.
[03:38:14.877 --> 03:38:17.679]  Nobody else can make these jokes anymore on television.
[03:38:17.679 --> 03:38:18.559]  They wouldn't get a season.
[03:38:18.559 --> 03:38:20.520]  They wouldn't get a pilot.
[03:38:20.520 --> 03:38:31.226]  No, and you know, I think, I think that Matt Stone and Trey are, they're probably at the point now where they're like, if we get canceled, we just get canceled.
[03:38:31.226 --> 03:38:33.688]  Like we've been doing this for like 20 years and
[03:38:34.711 --> 03:38:38.094]  Uh, they don't, they're not really beholden to anybody.
[03:38:38.094 --> 03:38:46.822]  I don't think that this is... Well, if you recall, they've actually reached, I would say, probably twice in their careers making South Park where they've wanted to be canceled.
[03:38:46.822 --> 03:38:53.908]  Right, well, wasn't it last season that they had, like, hashtag cancel South Park as, like, the ending frame of every episode?
[03:38:53.908 --> 03:38:55.650]  Yeah, it was the last season of the year before it, but yeah.
[03:38:57.048 --> 03:39:00.270]  Yeah, but they've always pushed the envelope.
[03:39:00.270 --> 03:39:08.096]  I still remember the first season, or one of the first seasons, they were feeding bacon to a pig on camera.
[03:39:11.076 --> 03:39:16.258]  On their DVD extras and just saying, oh, you taste so good, don't you?
[03:39:16.258 --> 03:39:20.320]  And it's like they're always been like way out there, but hilarious at the same time.
[03:39:20.320 --> 03:39:24.082]  Yeah, they showed up to the those film awards or whatever, Tripping Acid.
[03:39:24.082 --> 03:39:39.629]  And then, of course, they had the entire they had they had the entire theater industry, live theater industry hating them because their their show, Book of Mormon, is the most successful musical ever on Broadway by far.
[03:39:39.629 --> 03:39:39.809]  Right.
[03:39:40.948 --> 03:39:44.211]  Well, did you ever see their old musical they did?
[03:39:44.211 --> 03:39:45.372]  Cannibal the Musical?
[03:39:45.372 --> 03:39:47.534]  Did you ever see that?
[03:39:47.534 --> 03:39:48.495]  No, was that before?
[03:39:48.495 --> 03:39:50.877]  It was a movie.
[03:39:50.877 --> 03:39:52.298]  It was a movie.
[03:39:52.298 --> 03:39:57.223]  I don't think it was ever performed, but it's called Cannibal the Musical and it's crazy.
[03:40:00.930 --> 03:40:06.333]  I just wonder where, because again, South Park is like, nobody else can really make jokes like they can.
[03:40:06.333 --> 03:40:07.854]  They're kind of grandfathered in.
[03:40:07.854 --> 03:40:20.501]  It's like the last relic of 90s pop culture entertainment, that thread of not giving a you-know-what and giving the middle finger to PC.
[03:40:20.501 --> 03:40:25.104]  It's like they're the last bastion of that, so now they almost have a duty to stick around.
[03:40:25.104 --> 03:40:27.786]  But I love the fact, because really, here's what it is to me.
[03:40:31.561 --> 03:40:34.283]  They've made plenty of money making South Park, millions of dollars.
[03:40:34.283 --> 03:40:35.945]  They don't need money.
[03:40:35.945 --> 03:40:39.447]  And so they sit here and give the middle finger like, yeah, we don't care, ban us in China.
[03:40:39.447 --> 03:40:41.609]  We'd rather have American freedom than Chinese money.
[03:40:41.609 --> 03:40:47.974]  But then you have the NBA, these spoiled rotten brats making $20 million a year, who still want that Chinese money.
[03:40:47.974 --> 03:40:55.200]  And it just goes to show you the difference in the philosophical approach of what being happy is and what being American is.
[03:40:56.223 --> 03:41:11.946]  Well, and you know, South Park, and like you said, there's very few shows out there like it, but South Park has done a really good job over the course of its runtime of making fun of everybody.
[03:41:11.946 --> 03:41:19.408]  And they get away with how far they go on certain things because they are guilty of making fun of everyone equally.
[03:41:19.408 --> 03:41:20.548]  I mean, they'll go after
[03:41:22.012 --> 03:41:30.074]  You know, Mormons, they've gone after Scientologists, they've gone after Christians, they've gone after like every group that you can think of.
[03:41:30.074 --> 03:41:37.596]  Rich black Democrats, they've gone after rich white Republicans, they've gone after rich white black people.
[03:41:37.596 --> 03:41:40.657]  I mean, they've gone all over the gambit.
[03:41:40.657 --> 03:41:43.838]  Yeah, they parody Trump all the time, and I think it's funny!
[03:41:44.642 --> 03:41:47.264]  Yeah, a lot of their parodies are funny.
[03:41:47.264 --> 03:41:51.208]  Now, contrast that with the way that The Simpsons went.
[03:41:51.208 --> 03:41:54.611]  The Simpsons have gone full social justice warrior.
[03:41:54.611 --> 03:42:00.656]  I watched part of an episode, I think it was a couple weeks ago, and it's
[03:42:02.762 --> 03:42:04.563]  It's just one of the worst travesties.
[03:42:04.563 --> 03:42:10.108]  Yeah, they had the whole Jihad squad featured in an episode taking Trump out.
[03:42:10.108 --> 03:42:13.530]  I'm not even sure if Matt Groening is even involved really in that show anymore.
[03:42:13.530 --> 03:42:17.093]  I think it's just kind of just a Fox staple now.
[03:42:17.093 --> 03:42:19.875]  Because Matt's writing his own show for Netflix, Disenchantment.
[03:42:19.875 --> 03:42:21.116]  Right.
[03:42:21.116 --> 03:42:22.677]  Which isn't bad.
[03:42:22.677 --> 03:42:26.560]  But yeah, I don't know if he really has any say in The Simpsons anymore.
[03:42:26.560 --> 03:42:28.161]  Hey, final 30 seconds, Carpe.
[03:42:28.161 --> 03:42:29.162]  Take us a break.
[03:42:29.162 --> 03:42:30.343]  Plug anything you got coming up.
[03:42:31.744 --> 03:42:33.447]  So I don't have anything specific coming up.
[03:42:33.447 --> 03:42:36.453]  I've always got got meme world calm
[03:42:38.809 --> 03:42:41.470]  The site is updated, you know, daily.
[03:42:41.470 --> 03:42:45.410]  We've got 15, 16 contributors that are constantly putting new content up there.
[03:42:45.410 --> 03:42:50.152]  Go over to memeworld.com, check that out.
[03:42:50.152 --> 03:42:54.813]  You can always find all of the newest stuff from me and all of my friends there.
[03:42:54.813 --> 03:43:01.314]  And obviously you'll find terrible, terrible stuff there, so don't actually take my advice, don't go there, right?
[03:43:02.318 --> 03:43:04.439]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[03:43:04.439 --> 03:43:07.219]  I'm Wilbur Snakeland.
[03:43:07.219 --> 03:43:28.905]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro to the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[03:43:29.965 --> 03:43:41.915]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad.
[03:43:41.915 --> 03:43:45.237]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[03:43:45.237 --> 03:43:46.458]  There's no medical journals.
[03:43:46.458 --> 03:43:47.940]  There's no facts.
[03:43:47.940 --> 03:43:49.401]  You need fluoride.
[03:43:49.401 --> 03:43:49.821]  Just drink it.
[03:43:51.994 --> 03:44:01.222]  And then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[03:44:01.222 --> 03:44:06.746]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[03:44:06.746 --> 03:44:09.789]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[03:44:09.789 --> 03:44:14.212]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[03:44:14.212 --> 03:44:20.818]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[03:44:21.258 --> 03:44:27.261]  They might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[03:44:27.261 --> 03:44:32.643]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[03:44:32.643 --> 03:44:40.426]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[03:44:40.426 --> 03:44:41.326]  It's that simple.
[03:44:41.326 --> 03:44:47.229]  Find out about the iodine conspiracy at Infowarstore.com, and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[03:44:47.509 --> 03:44:51.311]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research iodine deficiency.
[03:44:51.311 --> 03:44:53.232]  It's the key to everything.
[03:44:53.232 --> 03:45:00.855]  And then, go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality iodine and biotruth selenium at InfoWareStore.com today.
[03:45:02.313 --> 03:45:05.896]  InfoWars presents Alex Jones.
[03:45:05.896 --> 03:45:21.168]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious, came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies die in the womb, and it causes cancer.
[03:45:21.168 --> 03:45:23.790]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[03:45:24.230 --> 03:45:31.114]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[03:45:31.114 --> 03:45:39.720]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children.
[03:45:39.720 --> 03:45:45.423]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:45.423 --> 03:45:45.964]  Drink fluoride.
[03:45:46.704 --> 03:45:48.686]  Drink fluoride and die!
[03:45:48.686 --> 03:45:51.990]  Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over!
[03:45:51.990 --> 03:45:55.534]  Do not visit InfoWarsTore.com and get high quality iodine to counter it.
[03:45:55.534 --> 03:45:55.874]  No!
[03:45:55.874 --> 03:45:57.836]  Roll over and die, dirty Americans!
[03:46:02.361 --> 03:46:08.487]  Now what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners.
[03:46:08.487 --> 03:46:09.748]  I'm just taking the facts.
[03:46:09.748 --> 03:46:10.950]  I own a chainsaw.
[03:46:10.950 --> 03:46:12.872]  I've had it since I was in college.
[03:46:12.872 --> 03:46:16.896]  And it's a great good old chainsaw and I've used it probably 500 times.
[03:46:16.896 --> 03:46:23.682]  But a few times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it.
[03:46:23.682 --> 03:46:25.804]  Now imagine if somebody told me to put
[03:46:26.565 --> 03:46:29.666]  Let's say superglue in the oil container on it.
[03:46:29.666 --> 03:46:31.107]  It would seize up forever.
[03:46:31.107 --> 03:46:32.888]  But only an evil person would do that.
[03:46:32.888 --> 03:46:35.849]  Well, fluoride's like putting superglue in a chainsaw.
[03:46:35.849 --> 03:46:37.070]  It's going to make it seize up.
[03:46:37.070 --> 03:46:38.790]  And that's why they put it in the water.
[03:46:38.790 --> 03:46:41.011]  And they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family.
[03:46:41.011 --> 03:46:42.252]  Yes, they're really evil.
[03:46:42.252 --> 03:46:47.174]  Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication.
[03:46:47.174 --> 03:46:48.094]  It's that simple.
[03:46:48.094 --> 03:46:51.716]  I know you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late.
[03:46:51.716 --> 03:46:53.477]  It's part of the iodine conspiracy.
[03:46:53.477 --> 03:46:55.718]  Find out more at Infowarsstore.com and take
[03:46:56.238 --> 03:46:57.679]  Action against the globalists.
[03:46:57.679 --> 03:46:59.621]  Carbon's everywhere on this planet!
[03:46:59.621 --> 03:47:06.526]  It's almost like we're carbon-based lifeforms!
[03:47:06.526 --> 03:47:09.148]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:33.516 --> 03:47:49.265]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left in America has aligned itself with the anti-American, communist, globalist, criminal confab that they hate!
[03:47:49.265 --> 03:47:57.330]  And they don't realize how they're being used like pawns in a game of global chess, geopolitical chess.
[03:47:57.330 --> 03:48:00.932]  And they have a very short-sighted vision of history and the future.
[03:48:03.373 --> 03:48:10.521]  And so they're openly engaging in all this right now, and they don't realize how they're their own worst enemy.
[03:48:10.521 --> 03:48:19.010]  Alex Jones breaks down how the leftists are being used like pawns in chess.
[03:48:19.010 --> 03:48:23.555]  What do socialism, communism, and globalism all have in common?
[03:48:24.551 --> 03:48:34.723]  They're all command-and-control centralized systems that have a Politburo or a group of bureaucrats, technocrats that run them.
[03:48:34.723 --> 03:48:41.692]  And if you study the top Fortune 100 companies, the big banks, to a company, they finance
[03:48:43.669 --> 03:48:47.792]  The move towards centralization and towards world government.
[03:48:47.792 --> 03:48:56.618]  So when President Trump gets up there and says, socialism, communism, and globalism are our enemies, he is singling out
[03:48:57.765 --> 03:49:02.908]  The true enemy of humanity, and that's why the system is so incredibly scared.
[03:49:02.908 --> 03:49:11.213]  The 20th century industrialized and computerized everything, and humanity really got sucker punched by these guys with all the Hollywood propaganda.
[03:49:11.213 --> 03:49:27.063]  But 19 years into the 21st century, humanity is coming back from the dead and really realizing what's happening and understanding how these big multinational corporations aren't liberal, they're fascistic, they're authoritarian, but they package themselves as liberal and loving.
[03:49:27.563 --> 03:49:31.886]  The truth is they're trying to create a planet that's post-human.
[03:49:31.886 --> 03:49:37.751]  Where normal natural human activity has been basically outlawed and everything is artificiality.
[03:49:37.751 --> 03:49:44.095]  Where you've got to get government and corporate approval to even have a child because we've been so poisoned it's impossible to have a child.
[03:49:44.095 --> 03:49:46.617]  That's their final revolution.
[03:49:46.617 --> 03:49:48.479]  Ending what we are as a species forever.
[03:49:48.959 --> 03:49:51.885]  That's what the Carnegie Endowment was tasked to do at the end of World War II.
[03:49:51.885 --> 03:49:53.528]  And that's their plan.
[03:49:53.528 --> 03:49:56.153]  And that's why they're so upset at President Trump.
[03:49:56.153 --> 03:49:57.716]  That's why they're so upset at Infowars.
[03:49:58.883 --> 03:50:11.648]  Infowars is credited by the leftist-run CIA, and by the Ford Foundation, and by Media Matters, and by all these different globalist organs, as launching Trump, and as writing the talking points for the global resistance.
[03:50:11.648 --> 03:50:12.829]  But we really didn't do that.
[03:50:12.829 --> 03:50:26.795]  We simply studied the white papers of the shycoms, and the EU, and the Council on Foreign Relations, and the transhumanist movements, and understood what their real sneak attack revolution against humanity was, and decided to say,
[03:50:27.595 --> 03:50:33.539]  I bet folks will want to hear about this, especially as it begins to actually manifest and emerge.
[03:50:33.539 --> 03:50:36.141]  And I bet people will resist it.
[03:50:36.141 --> 03:50:37.321]  And you know what?
[03:50:37.321 --> 03:50:42.545]  My basic understanding of reality and history turned out to be damn right.
[03:50:42.545 --> 03:50:46.027]  And so I want the enemy to know, I didn't bring this resistance.
[03:50:46.027 --> 03:50:49.589]  I simply helped point it out and I bet on humanity.
[03:50:49.589 --> 03:50:51.491]  Something you haven't been doing.
[03:50:51.491 --> 03:50:55.173]  So if you want to stand with humanity and stand with Infowars and stand with President Trump,
[03:50:55.493 --> 03:51:00.156]  Spread the word about this live broadcast, spread the word about the articles, and buy some products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:51:00.156 --> 03:51:02.417]  Because without you supporting us, the enemy will win.
[03:51:02.417 --> 03:51:08.800]  You take action, we are gonna kick some major globalist ass into the future and have a pro-human future.
[03:51:08.800 --> 03:51:21.627]  We're fighting a campaign against leftists, socialists, and globalists who want to return to reckless wars, open borders, rampant crime, and totally disastrous one-way trade deals.
[03:51:21.627 --> 03:51:23.688]  We're changing that one around very quickly.
[03:51:26.249 --> 03:51:37.742]  They believe America is the world's piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy, military, and defense of every other nation in the world but our own.
[03:51:37.742 --> 03:51:41.366]  It's not happening anymore.
[03:51:41.366 --> 03:51:43.028]  Our political opposition
[03:51:43.900 --> 03:52:04.677]  made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens and you know that's what's been happening and that's why 2016 was so important and that's why 2020 I can never say it's more important but you know it's like the roots of a tree you plant the baby tree it's got a catch
[03:52:05.538 --> 03:52:07.239]  Get that extra time.
[03:52:07.239 --> 03:52:09.080]  We'll have more tax cuts.
[03:52:09.080 --> 03:52:13.622]  We'll have even, I'll tell you what, we have rebuilt our military.
[03:52:13.622 --> 03:52:19.885]  What we've done has never been done before.
[03:52:19.885 --> 03:52:29.669]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, last five minutes of the Alex Jones Show here at Infowars.com slash show and band dot video.
[03:52:29.669 --> 03:52:31.150]  And where do we really go from here?
[03:52:31.917 --> 03:52:38.423]  What do I want to use this final five minutes for until I take over the war room from 3 to 4 p.m.
[03:52:38.423 --> 03:52:42.847]  Central and then Harrison finishes it off for me till 6 p.m.
[03:52:42.847 --> 03:52:52.356]  normally where I'm at but you know ever since coming on board here at InfoWars and being a part of it what we see is
[03:52:53.973 --> 03:53:03.633]  We are tomorrow's news today, sometimes next month's news today, sometimes next year's news today, sometimes next decade's news today.
[03:53:03.633 --> 03:53:04.034]  And so...
[03:53:04.980 --> 03:53:13.443]  When you see stories like Obama going to a Soros fundraiser, you're not surprised because we told you Obama was working with Soros.
[03:53:13.443 --> 03:53:32.210]  When you see stories about a website being launched called Racist Watch that literally maps out and names, with addresses, names of individuals who donated to Trump's campaign in 2016, which is of course an intimidation factor to try to stop you from donating again,
[03:53:33.237 --> 03:53:35.299]  Which ultimately probably won't matter.
[03:53:35.299 --> 03:53:40.104]  It's just this is the left engaged in domestic terror and now openly and publicly doxxing people.
[03:53:40.104 --> 03:53:41.225]  Well, you're not surprised.
[03:53:41.225 --> 03:53:44.349]  We told you that as well.
[03:53:44.349 --> 03:53:47.712]  And it's a weird habit.
[03:53:47.712 --> 03:53:49.795]  It's not even a habit.
[03:53:49.795 --> 03:53:52.638]  It's just we're focused.
[03:53:52.638 --> 03:53:54.840]  Like if you're an athlete,
[03:53:56.693 --> 03:54:09.936]  In competition, you don't dwell on the play from four plays ago, or from two series ago, or the shot from last quarter, or the last hole, or whatever sport you're playing.
[03:54:09.936 --> 03:54:11.296]  You have to move on.
[03:54:11.296 --> 03:54:12.136]  You're in a competition.
[03:54:12.136 --> 03:54:13.736]  You're in a battle.
[03:54:13.736 --> 03:54:14.597]  You have to win.
[03:54:14.597 --> 03:54:15.937]  You can't dwell on the past.
[03:54:15.937 --> 03:54:19.998]  You have to move forward and continue for victory.
[03:54:19.998 --> 03:54:21.498]  But I'm trying to make it a habit.
[03:54:22.588 --> 03:54:26.411]  Because we pick up new audience members every day that don't get to see all the InfoWars content.
[03:54:26.411 --> 03:54:31.734]  They don't see all the content that was erased off YouTube proving how right we were about all this stuff.
[03:54:31.734 --> 03:54:33.296]  So I went into the archives today.
[03:54:33.296 --> 03:54:36.078]  I had to go back months to find it.
[03:54:36.078 --> 03:54:41.341]  But... We... And I explained it in the clip.
[03:54:41.341 --> 03:54:45.184]  I'm gonna air it on The War Room coming up here at 3 p.m.
[03:54:45.184 --> 03:54:50.468]  But there's a reason why a lot of times when Alex comes on air and has intel
[03:54:52.711 --> 03:55:01.535]  And he goes with it, it sounds crazy at the time, and you don't see until months later how accurate it actually was.
[03:55:01.535 --> 03:55:03.896]  And we have to do a lot of that around here.
[03:55:03.896 --> 03:55:06.337]  And there's a reason why other people don't do it.
[03:55:06.337 --> 03:55:17.422]  They're afraid, for multiple reasons, and they want to fit in to the D.C., and really by extension, New York establishment.
[03:55:19.414 --> 03:55:24.935]  That doesn't like the way we do things here at InfoWars.
[03:55:24.935 --> 03:55:41.279]  But we are just a representation, a manifestation of the Republic screaming, fighting all the corruption that has now come full circle and we're seeing it aimed at Donald Trump.
[03:55:44.844 --> 03:55:47.906]  We see they complain about lynching.
[03:55:47.906 --> 03:55:52.430]  They literally depict Trump being lynched at leftist protests.
[03:55:52.430 --> 03:56:02.898]  They literally put up whole nooses and everything and guillotines or whatever to pretend here we are killing Trump in our weird ritual.
[03:56:02.898 --> 03:56:09.263]  But then Trump says a political lynching is happening to him, which is 100% accurate, and all of a sudden he's the worst guy in the world.
[03:56:09.263 --> 03:56:10.744]  How dare he say lynching?
[03:56:10.744 --> 03:56:12.806]  So Trump has to walk on a tightrope.
[03:56:14.827 --> 03:56:22.029]  But everyone else on the left, they can just run around on a big wide open field and do whatever the hell they want.
[03:56:22.029 --> 03:56:26.291]  Depict lynching Trump, depict chopping Trump's head off.
[03:56:26.291 --> 03:56:32.833]  CNN literally writes a thing about Hillary Clinton being lynched politically, and that's okay.
[03:56:32.833 --> 03:56:40.375]  But if Trump does it, well, it's the end of the world, isn't it?
[03:56:40.375 --> 03:56:41.856]  So this is just what you get.
[03:56:43.083 --> 03:56:43.683]  From the left.
[03:56:43.683 --> 03:56:48.065]  It's really amazing what the left has become, honestly.
[03:56:48.065 --> 03:56:49.506]  It's mind-boggling.
[03:56:49.506 --> 03:56:56.409]  What they embrace, what they endorse, what they promote, and just what they do on the streets.
[03:56:56.409 --> 03:56:58.930]  It's sick.
[03:56:58.930 --> 03:57:00.570]  It is sick.
[03:57:00.570 --> 03:57:08.814]  So, we just cover it, give you the inside information, that's why they hate us, that's why they ban us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:57:09.887 --> 03:57:14.850]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, but support yourself, get the great products, get the great supplements.
[03:57:14.850 --> 03:57:16.150]  It's all at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:57:16.150 --> 03:57:20.773]  The everything must go sale is happening now.
[03:57:20.773 --> 03:57:24.495]  And you see the censorship runner, folks.
[03:57:25.678 --> 03:57:27.859]  And 2020 is now.
[03:57:27.859 --> 03:57:28.399]  It is 2020.
[03:57:28.399 --> 03:57:33.680]  The calendars may not have flipped yet, but for all intents and purposes, it's already 2020.
[03:57:33.680 --> 03:57:44.043]  So fill our engines with fuel by going to InfoWarsStore.com so that we can launch into this 2020 election cycle and get total victory for free speech in America.
[03:57:44.043 --> 03:57:45.343]  That does it for the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:45.343 --> 03:57:48.924]  I'm going to go sit in and host the War Room for an hour.
[03:57:48.924 --> 03:57:51.305]  Stay tuned to Band.Video and InfoWars.com slash show.
