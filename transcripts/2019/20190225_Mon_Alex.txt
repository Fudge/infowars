[00:00:09.858 --> 00:00:10.880]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.204]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:43.580]  We're live February 25th 2019 and we've got an amazing raft of guests in studio and not in studio and incredible breaking news that we're going to go over all of it on the other side.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.421]  You won't believe what AOC said next but first I want to go to this important
[00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:49.761]  Report.
[00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:53.102]  Californians can't name the 45th president.
[00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:57.804]  This shows the incredible ignorance of blue areas.
[00:00:57.884 --> 00:00:58.364]  Here it is.
[00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:00.565]  You don't know who the 45th president is?
[00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:01.105]  No.
[00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:02.045]  Is it Bush?
[00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:02.525]  Trump.
[00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:03.866]  It's Donald Trump.
[00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:05.026]  Oh yeah, f*** that guy.
[00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:07.807]  How many presidents do we have?
[00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:08.747]  We've had 45.
[00:01:08.807 --> 00:01:11.368]  Alright, so Obama.
[00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.169]  Do you know who the current president is?
[00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:14.729]  Uh, Obama.
[00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:28.299]  You're watching InfoWars.com in Venice Beach in California.
[00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.660]  We're asking people one simple question.
[00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:33.122]  Who is the 45th President of the United States?
[00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:42.408]  Hey guys, can you tell me who the 45th President of the United States is?
[00:01:43.352 --> 00:01:49.654]  Barack Obama.
[00:01:49.894 --> 00:01:52.255]  Who's the 45th president of the United States?
[00:01:52.435 --> 00:01:53.275]  I have no idea.
[00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:54.696]  Can you name the 45th president?
[00:01:54.716 --> 00:01:55.476]  Obama?
[00:01:55.736 --> 00:01:56.196]  Do you know?
[00:01:56.256 --> 00:01:58.137]  Do you know who the 45th president of the United States is?
[00:01:59.277 --> 00:02:00.177]  Barack Obama.
[00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:03.058]  Do you know?
[00:02:03.078 --> 00:02:07.400]  Can you tell me who the 45th president of the United States is?
[00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.940]  George Washington.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.361]  Do you guys know who the 45th president of the United States is?
[00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:14.148]  There isn't a 45th.
[00:02:14.228 --> 00:02:15.629]  Do you know who the 45th president is?
[00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.290]  Negative, Ghostwriter, I do not.
[00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:18.851]  You don't?
[00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:19.571]  Any guesses?
[00:02:20.412 --> 00:02:20.632]  None.
[00:02:21.032 --> 00:02:22.533]  It's Donald Trump, but okay.
[00:02:23.634 --> 00:02:28.077]  Anyone want to tag team help him out here?
[00:02:28.097 --> 00:02:29.017]  Let's phone a friend.
[00:02:29.198 --> 00:02:29.458]  No.
[00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:32.460]  No intelligent life.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.861]  Next question, do you vote?
[00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:35.522]  No.
[00:02:35.562 --> 00:02:37.803]  By the way, this is not Cherry Face.
[00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:39.784]  Do you know who the 45th president is?
[00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:43.033]  No, no idea.
[00:02:43.053 --> 00:02:43.913]  This is not Cherry Fifth.
[00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:44.073]  The 44th?
[00:02:44.353 --> 00:02:44.553]  No.
[00:02:45.434 --> 00:02:45.874]  Really?
[00:02:45.894 --> 00:02:46.934]  Almost no one knew.
[00:02:47.374 --> 00:02:48.054]  What are we on now?
[00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:50.875]  You tell me, who's the 45th president?
[00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:52.015]  I don't f***ing know.
[00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:54.615]  And I guarantee you, they're all Democrats.
[00:02:56.756 --> 00:02:59.216]  Earlier than now.
[00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:00.177]  We've had 45.
[00:03:00.217 --> 00:03:02.017]  Alright, so Obama.
[00:03:02.237 --> 00:03:05.678]  It's not George Washington, George Bush?
[00:03:06.398 --> 00:03:06.998]  No emotion.
[00:03:07.058 --> 00:03:07.518]  Bill Clinton?
[00:03:08.832 --> 00:03:09.613]  No life force.
[00:03:10.654 --> 00:03:10.894]  Who?
[00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:12.976]  It's Donald Trump.
[00:03:13.837 --> 00:03:15.198]  Nope, no fire in the eyes.
[00:03:15.218 --> 00:03:17.581]  Do you guys know who the 45th president of the United States is?
[00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:18.201]  No, I do not.
[00:03:18.442 --> 00:03:18.842]  No, you don't?
[00:03:18.862 --> 00:03:19.563]  It was one of them.
[00:03:20.103 --> 00:03:20.504]  What'd you say?
[00:03:20.524 --> 00:03:21.464]  It was the president.
[00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:22.205]  It was the president.
[00:03:22.906 --> 00:03:25.328]  Do you know the 16th?
[00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:26.870]  Lincoln.
[00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.410]  Lincoln.
[00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.872]  Wow, I thought you said you didn't know any of them.
[00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:31.150]  Okay.
[00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.431]  Do you know who the current president is?
[00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:34.052]  Uh, Obama.
[00:03:34.252 --> 00:03:36.735]  Do you guys know who the 45th president of the United States is?
[00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:37.235]  There isn't one.
[00:03:37.996 --> 00:03:38.576]  There isn't one?
[00:03:38.596 --> 00:03:39.277]  Donald Trump.
[00:03:39.757 --> 00:03:40.278]  Donald Trump?
[00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:40.899]  Is that his name?
[00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.560]  You don't know who the 45th president is?
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.081]  No.
[00:03:43.561 --> 00:03:44.041]  Is it Bush?
[00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:45.863]  It's Donald Trump.
[00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:46.824]  Oh yeah, f**k that guy.
[00:03:46.864 --> 00:03:47.965]  You don't like him?
[00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:49.286]  Nah, I'm a socialist.
[00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:51.248]  Oh, you're a socialist!
[00:03:51.308 --> 00:03:53.530]  Cool, alright, well enjoy your capitalism here.
[00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.133]  Yeah, no star in Venezuela, fat ass.
[00:03:56.598 --> 00:03:59.160]  Can you tell me who the 45th President of the United States is?
[00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.781]  Nope.
[00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:01.461]  No, just one guess.
[00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:01.981]  One guess.
[00:04:03.923 --> 00:04:04.663]  President Trump.
[00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:05.423]  It is!
[00:04:05.804 --> 00:04:07.725]  Do you know who the 45th President of the United States is?
[00:04:11.427 --> 00:04:12.068]  Trumpy!
[00:04:12.128 --> 00:04:12.848]  Trump, there you go!
[00:04:13.048 --> 00:04:13.348]  Who?
[00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:14.329]  Barack Obama.
[00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:15.430]  It's Trump.
[00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.952]  So if the 44th President was Obama, who's the 45th?
[00:04:21.013 --> 00:04:21.633]  Donald Trump.
[00:04:21.653 --> 00:04:22.854]  Good job.
[00:04:22.874 --> 00:04:25.396]  Can you tell me who the 45th President of the United States is?
[00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:26.791]  No.
[00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:29.412]  No.
[00:04:30.292 --> 00:04:31.112]  Ding, ding, ding!
[00:04:31.132 --> 00:04:36.093]  Who's the 45th president of the United States?
[00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:36.913]  The current one.
[00:04:37.693 --> 00:04:38.573]  You got it right.
[00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:41.074]  What do you think about people who don't know the answer to that question?
[00:04:41.094 --> 00:04:46.295]  Uh, we got a problem with the education system in this country, don't we?
[00:04:46.615 --> 00:04:49.276]  Can you tell me who the 45th president of the United States is?
[00:04:50.096 --> 00:04:51.536]  I don't care for presidents.
[00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:53.196]  Did you say George Washington?
[00:04:54.797 --> 00:04:55.757]  No, it's Trump.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.500]  I'm Alex.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.161]  I'm Kate.
[00:04:58.301 --> 00:04:58.821]  And I'm Allie.
[00:04:59.061 --> 00:05:00.602]  And you're watching InfoWars.com!
[00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:13.792]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:15.532]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:05:15.612 --> 00:05:17.353]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:19.754]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:05:19.914 --> 00:05:21.475]  Brain, body, heart.
[00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:22.935]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[00:05:23.015 --> 00:05:24.236]  You've got the children's.
[00:05:24.376 --> 00:05:25.356]  You've got the adults.
[00:05:25.456 --> 00:05:26.377]  You've got the krill oil.
[00:05:26.397 --> 00:05:29.858]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[00:05:29.878 --> 00:05:32.259]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.501]  It'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry.
[00:05:34.581 --> 00:05:35.582]  You want something like this?
[00:05:35.682 --> 00:05:36.542]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:05:36.643 --> 00:05:38.504]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:05:38.564 --> 00:05:39.725]  It's so good, in my view.
[00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:41.987]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:05:42.007 --> 00:05:46.451]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:52.777]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:05:55.728 --> 00:06:01.709]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:02.529]  I just can't do it!
[00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:19.673]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:44.767 --> 00:07:00.701]  If we don't turn the ship around and so it's basically like there's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult and it does lead I think young people to have a legitimate question you know should
[00:07:02.043 --> 00:07:03.944]  Is it okay to still have children?
[00:07:04.405 --> 00:07:22.395]  And, I mean, not just financially, because people are graduating with 20, 30, $100,000 worth of student loan debt, and so they can't even afford to have kids in the house, but also just this basic moral question, like, what do we do?
[00:07:22.555 --> 00:07:24.757]  And even if you don't have kids,
[00:07:25.894 --> 00:07:31.757]  There are still children here in the world and we have a moral obligation to them and to leave a better world for them.
[00:07:32.198 --> 00:07:38.521]  And this idea that if we just, you know, I've been working on this for X amount of years.
[00:07:39.962 --> 00:07:41.443]  It's like not good enough.
[00:07:41.703 --> 00:07:44.585]  We need a universal sense of urgency.
[00:07:45.806 --> 00:07:51.389]  And people are trying to like introduce watered down proposals that are frankly going to kill us.
[00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:54.246]  A lack of urgency is going to kill us.
[00:07:54.306 --> 00:08:00.048]  It doesn't matter if you agree that climate change is an important issue.
[00:08:00.608 --> 00:08:01.648]  At this point, it doesn't matter.
[00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:07.310]  If you believe climate change is a problem, that's not even the issue.
[00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.971]  So, there she is on Instagram Live.
[00:08:12.511 --> 00:08:18.033]  Of course, the evil Alex Jones isn't allowed on Instagram Live or Periscope or YouTube or any of those places.
[00:08:19.585 --> 00:08:41.318]  Because you can't have me go, oh look, I made a film called Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement 11 years ago with their own documents, admitting they want a planetary government, that you'll have a world ID card tied to a planetary social score, algorithm profiles, what I called it, and it'll track everything you do in live time with your carbon credits and tax and control you.
[00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:43.800]  Forced inoculations.
[00:08:46.059 --> 00:08:50.202]  Sex education of five-year-olds, teaching them to be homosexual.
[00:08:50.942 --> 00:08:51.603]  All of it's here.
[00:08:52.383 --> 00:08:56.486]  The state coming in to reduce population by design.
[00:08:58.167 --> 00:09:13.477]  And now it's all mainstream news, and AOC can sit up there unopposed, in these cheesy, look I'm a regular person, I'm chopping up sweet potatoes, here in my kitchen.
[00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:19.527]  She probably should have a big rail of methamphetamine right before it.
[00:09:21.568 --> 00:09:25.970]  So is it okay to have kids in the face of climate change?
[00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.633]  This is their religion and you notice she said there's a consensus of scientists.
[00:09:31.854 --> 00:09:33.475]  Turned out that's all been proven to be a fraud.
[00:09:33.755 --> 00:09:37.636]  First it was the world's gonna freeze in the 60s and 70s and 80s.
[00:09:38.416 --> 00:09:41.437]  The new ice age caused by carbon dioxide.
[00:09:41.797 --> 00:09:45.298]  Then it was going to be warming, because we did warm for a while.
[00:09:45.598 --> 00:09:48.279]  And then when it started cooling off again, well now it's just change.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.520]  A legitimate question.
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.621]  Is it okay to still have children?
[00:09:55.241 --> 00:09:58.282]  Well let me see, the Japanese have 1.1 child for every 2 adults.
[00:09:59.302 --> 00:10:00.303]  The Italians have 1.2 children.
[00:10:02.025 --> 00:10:02.686]  The United States has 1.6.
[00:10:03.066 --> 00:10:08.092]  The third world on average has about 4.
[00:10:12.056 --> 00:10:13.978]  And so don't worry, Europe is dying.
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.021]  Japan's dying.
[00:10:17.703 --> 00:10:21.247]  And most indigenous groups around the world are also dying.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:31.344]  But what's not dying is terrible populations out of Latin America and Africa, and then of course the slave population of China and India.
[00:10:32.085 --> 00:10:34.246]  Those populations are exploding.
[00:10:35.847 --> 00:10:37.748]  And they're going under a total authoritarianism.
[00:10:40.789 --> 00:10:45.331]  It's mind-blowing that we've gotten to this point.
[00:10:46.472 --> 00:10:47.753]  But there's AOC.
[00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.091]  She wears $3,000, $5,000 outfits.
[00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:53.631]  She wears $1,000 shoes.
[00:10:56.712 --> 00:10:59.032]  But that's okay if she earned it.
[00:10:59.852 --> 00:11:13.836]  The problem is she then badmouths people that have a carbon footprint or have children when it's people like her that fly around on private jets that have carbon footprints hundreds of times bigger than regular persons.
[00:11:13.856 --> 00:11:15.816]  By the way, a carbon footprint's wonderful.
[00:11:17.657 --> 00:11:19.177]  They believe Mars once had water.
[00:11:20.831 --> 00:11:26.913]  They know it has ice caps, but flowing water, but somehow lost its atmosphere.
[00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:30.955]  Well, we're losing our atmosphere.
[00:11:31.595 --> 00:11:32.075]  That's a fact.
[00:11:33.256 --> 00:11:43.220]  The atmosphere was much thicker in all the ice core and all the mud studies and other deep core studies they've done, where carbon dioxide was hundreds of times higher than it is now.
[00:11:44.841 --> 00:11:45.761]  To trace gas now.
[00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:56.153]  Plants and animals live off two gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, in a symbiotic relationship.
[00:11:57.274 --> 00:12:02.357]  And carbon dioxide levels are way lower than they were a million years ago.
[00:12:03.978 --> 00:12:07.761]  And now a little bit of human activity puts a little bit more atmosphere out there.
[00:12:09.502 --> 00:12:14.046]  And governments respond with a global secret covert operation.
[00:12:15.936 --> 00:12:30.101]  Much of which has now been declassified to spray barium salts, aluminum dioxide, and radioactive isotopes into the air, which are actually stripping the atmosphere and thinning the ozone layer.
[00:12:34.063 --> 00:12:41.586]  So this is the standard talking point of the World Population Group and all the rest that are just eugenics groups.
[00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.811]  And you can argue, okay, maybe some places are overpopulated.
[00:12:47.511 --> 00:12:58.293]  But the issue is, is the globalists then target the highest IQ areas, the highest IQ demographics, and tell them not to have children.
[00:12:58.313 --> 00:13:03.534]  It's like the movie Idiocracy, this genius that my good friend Mike Judge wrote.
[00:13:05.554 --> 00:13:06.954]  Literally just a couple days he wrote that.
[00:13:08.034 --> 00:13:10.695]  And it was a 200 years of the future, people are so stupid.
[00:13:11.721 --> 00:13:14.703]  From inbreeding of dumb people that the average person can hardly talk.
[00:13:15.244 --> 00:13:17.165]  He said, you know, who knew it would actually come in 20 years?
[00:13:22.089 --> 00:13:23.310]  Oh, that's another interview you can't see.
[00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.972]  I forgot YouTube, you know, had millions of views, took it down.
[00:13:25.992 --> 00:13:28.494]  So you can't hear Mike Judge be interviewed.
[00:13:29.795 --> 00:13:31.256]  You can only hear AOC, right?
[00:13:35.336 --> 00:14:02.749]  And that's what's happening is the dumbest, laziest people, they can be white, they can be black, but the lowest IQ people are having the most children, and the government and the system pushes that and promotes it, but in idiocracy it shows the two really smart people, the couple, who both have 160 IQs, but they're a little nervous, want to save some more money first, and not sure it's good for the earth, so they don't have any kids, but the dumb people have kids, and so the population gets stupider and stupider.
[00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:14.057]  Of course, remember, she also just said a month ago, or I guess three weeks ago, that all human life will be dead in 12 years from climate change.
[00:14:15.678 --> 00:14:20.041]  Now, obviously, she thinks in 12 years, well, that doesn't happen.
[00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:20.781]  You won't remember.
[00:14:22.803 --> 00:14:23.323]  Here she is.
[00:14:23.343 --> 00:14:31.729]  And I think that the part of it that is generational is that
[00:14:32.811 --> 00:14:44.278]  Millennials and people and, you know, Gen Z and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like, the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[00:14:44.398 --> 00:14:49.922]  And your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it?
[00:14:49.942 --> 00:14:50.863]  And like, this is the war.
[00:14:50.883 --> 00:14:52.283]  This is our World War II.
[00:15:01.932 --> 00:15:02.612]  I'm speechless.
[00:15:04.834 --> 00:15:13.859]  The unintentional comedy here is stunning until you watch the video with Caitlin Bennett, Infowars.com reporter out in California.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.800]  She wasn't cherry-picking.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.261]  She talks to 50 people.
[00:15:18.202 --> 00:15:19.462]  Everybody she talked to is in the tape.
[00:15:20.043 --> 00:15:23.965]  And two of them out of 50 know that the 45th president is Trump.
[00:15:24.866 --> 00:15:25.346]  Two people!
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:34.142]  These folks, white, black, old, young, Hispanic, they don't know what planet they're on.
[00:15:34.923 --> 00:15:38.084]  They can't find their asses with both hands.
[00:15:39.224 --> 00:15:39.924]  But you know what?
[00:15:40.524 --> 00:15:45.026]  They hear AOC, the world's gonna end if you don't let me run everything!
[00:15:46.266 --> 00:15:48.707]  It's like Joy Behar, we caught Trump, he's a Russian agent!
[00:15:48.927 --> 00:15:49.527]  Yay!
[00:15:49.607 --> 00:15:51.628]  Even if that's true, you don't go yay, you go that's horrible.
[00:15:51.748 --> 00:15:52.428]  But it's not true.
[00:15:52.788 --> 00:15:54.169]  These are just scum!
[00:15:55.558 --> 00:15:59.225]  They are absolute mindless idiots led by demons!
[00:15:59.706 --> 00:16:00.808]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:16:05.854 --> 00:16:08.535]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:14.777]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[00:16:15.317 --> 00:16:27.321]  TurboForce from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[00:17:03.837 --> 00:17:05.178]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:17:05.258 --> 00:17:07.039]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:07.579]  It is!
[00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:12.161]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:17:12.642 --> 00:17:13.922]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:17:14.002 --> 00:17:15.743]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:17:15.803 --> 00:17:18.124]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:19.845]  Brain, body, heart.
[00:17:19.925 --> 00:17:21.326]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[00:17:21.386 --> 00:17:22.607]  You've got the children's.
[00:17:22.767 --> 00:17:23.707]  You've got the adults.
[00:17:23.847 --> 00:17:24.768]  You've got the krill oil.
[00:17:24.868 --> 00:17:28.230]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.631]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[00:17:30.991 --> 00:17:32.872]  It'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry.
[00:17:32.952 --> 00:17:33.953]  You want something like this?
[00:17:34.033 --> 00:17:34.913]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:17:35.013 --> 00:17:36.874]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:17:36.934 --> 00:17:38.075]  It's so good, in my view.
[00:17:38.155 --> 00:17:40.156]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:17:40.196 --> 00:17:44.818]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:17:46.579 --> 00:17:51.141]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:17:54.087 --> 00:17:59.900]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.862]  I just can't do it!
[00:18:03.706 --> 00:18:07.569]  Getting your protein has never been easier with InfoWars Life Protein Bars.

[00:19:02.912 --> 00:19:07.916]  Wars are like 12-round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[00:19:09.136 --> 00:19:13.900]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[00:19:15.031 --> 00:19:15.912]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[00:19:16.652 --> 00:19:17.113]  We stopped her.
[00:19:17.133 --> 00:19:18.053]  We got a nationalist in.
[00:19:19.315 --> 00:19:21.396]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[00:19:21.516 --> 00:19:22.457]  We are winning.
[00:19:23.278 --> 00:19:28.342]  But those of us who are at the very front line, at the tip of the spear, are under unprecedented attack.
[00:19:28.822 --> 00:19:33.346]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[00:19:33.886 --> 00:19:35.007]  This is about who wants it most.
[00:19:36.437 --> 00:19:39.558]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors, they've taken everything.
[00:19:39.998 --> 00:19:41.478]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands.

[00:20:02.123 --> 00:20:02.403]  Thank you.
[00:20:06.507 --> 00:20:09.137]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:41.977 --> 00:20:49.243]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:20:50.724 --> 00:20:56.709]  President Trump is preparing to depart to Vietnam to meet with Kim Jong-un.
[00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:02.774]  And Chuck Todd and others are saying it's all just PR to make the president look good.
[00:21:02.834 --> 00:21:03.255]  Well, no.
[00:21:04.457 --> 00:21:12.600]  Getting Kim Jong-un for over a year to not test any more missiles and destroy major nuclear sites, even though he hasn't destroyed them all, is a big step in the right direction.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:21.504]  And cutting North Korea out from China, who hasn't let them develop, and getting them to go the way of South Korea would be good for everybody.
[00:21:22.404 --> 00:21:23.924]  Obviously, I don't like Kim Jong-un.
[00:21:23.964 --> 00:21:24.905]  I don't like communists.
[00:21:24.925 --> 00:21:32.908]  But if Trump can get him to stop being part of the Chai Kom oppression of the North Korean people,
[00:21:33.755 --> 00:21:40.238]  That would be a great victory, and is bold, and I think has less than a 50-50 chance of succeeding.
[00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:58.107]  But those that are criticizing it, like Chuck Todd connected to the Clintons and the Obamas, when the Clintons helped give the reactors and real systems of oppression to the North, and actually aided the North in its oppression in many ways, it's just truly disgusting.
[00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:03.005]  Something else that's disgusting I'm going to put up on screen for you is Marco Rubio.
[00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:05.226]  I don't like Marco Rubio.
[00:22:06.146 --> 00:22:07.466]  You know, I was there.
[00:22:07.546 --> 00:22:08.807]  They were having press conferences.
[00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:11.107]  He walked over to the press conference I was already at.
[00:22:12.008 --> 00:22:13.128]  Wouldn't answer my questions.
[00:22:13.688 --> 00:22:14.428]  Was very rude.
[00:22:14.749 --> 00:22:17.529]  The media edited it to make it look like I got in his face.
[00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.890]  He started threatening to physically attack me.
[00:22:23.171 --> 00:22:24.311]  Well, Marco Rubio.
[00:22:24.391 --> 00:22:25.152]  Little Marco.
[00:22:25.352 --> 00:22:26.272]  Bathhouse Marco.
[00:22:27.386 --> 00:22:28.486]  Nothing wrong with him being gay.
[00:22:28.526 --> 00:22:31.227]  It's just that, you know, Bathhouse Marco is compromised.
[00:22:32.647 --> 00:22:41.709]  Little Marco tweeted, Rubio threatening Qaddafi style ending for Venezuela's Maduro.
[00:22:43.609 --> 00:22:44.990]  He tweeted that at Maduro.
[00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:46.790]  Do you know what that is?
[00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.931]  That's us getting down to Maduro's level.
[00:22:50.831 --> 00:22:54.952]  I know there's bipartisan support to remove the dictator of Venezuela.
[00:22:55.012 --> 00:22:55.652]  I hate his guts.
[00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:03.676]  They blow up food convoys, they shoot people in the streets, they purposely starve their population for political control.
[00:23:04.757 --> 00:23:08.160]  I don't want war with Russia, but Russia and China are both moving weapons into there.
[00:23:08.601 --> 00:23:10.062]  We're trying to move food convoys in.
[00:23:10.523 --> 00:23:13.585]  Trump is moving to remove Maduro.
[00:23:14.406 --> 00:23:19.711]  Pence is in Colombia meeting with the individual that most people believe really won the last election.
[00:23:20.391 --> 00:23:21.092]  So the U.S.
[00:23:21.232 --> 00:23:22.573]  is getting ready for regime change.
[00:23:23.376 --> 00:23:25.957]  And it's extremely dangerous, and I normally don't like it.
[00:23:26.097 --> 00:23:28.078]  Why go overthrow Saddam and put something in worse?
[00:23:29.619 --> 00:23:30.240]  Things like that.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:35.482]  But with Venezuela, it's destabilizing the entire of South America, Brazil, Colombia.
[00:23:35.962 --> 00:23:37.243]  Everyone's begging the U.S.
[00:23:37.263 --> 00:23:37.863]  to do something.
[00:23:38.224 --> 00:23:39.724]  Brazil's put troops on their borders.
[00:23:40.565 --> 00:23:44.307]  Five million people have already left in the last year, marching north.
[00:23:44.407 --> 00:23:45.707]  It's a national security crisis.
[00:23:48.089 --> 00:23:50.570]  And, you know, if America was better,
[00:23:51.809 --> 00:23:59.496]  Like some of the regime change we did in the 50s and things, where we didn't put pure evil in, or didn't remove one evil and put something in just as bad.
[00:24:00.336 --> 00:24:04.060]  By the 60s, our government supported dictators and fascists and murderers.
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.522]  We weren't doing that before, to a great extent.
[00:24:06.902 --> 00:24:13.828]  So I don't trust the neocons that are running this and the Democrats to have regime change, because they'll put something worse in!
[00:24:14.068 --> 00:24:19.313]  I don't trust them to have real elections there, because people like Marco Rubio
[00:24:21.212 --> 00:24:25.318]  And the neocons are just as bad as Maduro.
[00:24:25.338 --> 00:24:30.685]  I mean, you don't tweet something like that.
[00:24:31.507 --> 00:24:36.514]  Muammar Gaddafi, eight years before he was killed, made a deal with the US and with Obama.
[00:24:37.853 --> 00:24:40.734]  And invested 50 plus billion dollars in the U.S.
[00:24:40.774 --> 00:24:41.134]  and Europe.
[00:24:41.934 --> 00:24:44.135]  And he was giving almost all the money to the people.
[00:24:44.455 --> 00:24:45.435]  And he was helping Africa.
[00:24:45.495 --> 00:24:46.415]  I've studied the situation.
[00:24:46.915 --> 00:24:50.876]  And he really thought we were his friend after decades of him fighting with the West.
[00:24:51.116 --> 00:24:53.697]  He didn't blow up the Lockerbie-Scotland plane, all that stuff.
[00:24:53.717 --> 00:24:55.377]  That's been confirmed to be BS.
[00:24:55.897 --> 00:24:57.238]  Mueller was involved covering that up.
[00:24:58.518 --> 00:25:06.040]  And so they cold-bloodedly set him up and sent Al-Qaeda in to murder him and destabilize the whole country and kill hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:20.316]  So that's not good to have somebody that's already open to the West, wants to build up Africa, wants to work with us, and we set him up and kill him, and Hillary says, I came, I saw, he died?
[00:25:20.336 --> 00:25:25.199]  And then she, ha ha ha, ha ha ha, like a witch!
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.622]  So I get why Trump's leaning towards regime change, because it's a failed regime.
[00:25:31.382 --> 00:25:32.503]  A thousand starve a week.
[00:25:32.923 --> 00:25:34.744]  The government makes it illegal to even talk about it.
[00:25:35.124 --> 00:25:37.185]  They're mowing down crowds, they're blowing up food trucks.
[00:25:37.225 --> 00:25:38.326]  Maduro is a joke!
[00:25:39.841 --> 00:25:42.522]  But I'll tell you this, more Russian troops are going in there.
[00:25:43.262 --> 00:25:44.483]  Chinese are going in there.
[00:25:44.863 --> 00:25:46.863]  If Trump's gonna move, he's gotta do it right now.
[00:25:48.444 --> 00:25:59.348]  And Marco Rubio sure shouldn't be out there sending images of Qaddafi dead and comparing it to Maduro.
[00:26:04.597 --> 00:26:05.318]  It makes me sick.
[00:26:05.338 --> 00:26:06.919]  It makes me totally sick.
[00:26:06.939 --> 00:26:15.588]  I'm going to use this Chuck Todd clip in a minute, but it's two different issues, and I am leaning towards supporting regime change because there is no regime.
[00:26:15.648 --> 00:26:16.308]  It's collapsed.
[00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:17.269]  It's a hellhole.
[00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:18.150]  It's nightmarish.
[00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.411]  I want Venezuela to be free.
[00:26:19.692 --> 00:26:25.798]  It has incredible wealth and a lot of good people, but I have no faith in the globalists.
[00:26:26.178 --> 00:26:28.340]  If they get control, they'll make it just as bad or worse.
[00:26:29.645 --> 00:26:41.428]  It's just a real shame you've got bloodthirsty things like this being sent out by Marco Rubio that lowers us to Maduro's level and then will only make Maduro fight harder.
[00:26:41.948 --> 00:26:48.530]  Sending crap like that to Maduro and his regime only will embolden them and makes us lose the moral high ground.
[00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.551]  You know, on Friday when we saw those food convoys get burnt up, I thought maybe that's a false flag.
[00:26:54.514 --> 00:27:01.899]  Because Maduro really is an idiot if he thinks he can just burn up a couple hundred trucks or whatever of aid coming in out of Colombia.
[00:27:02.139 --> 00:27:08.104]  Then he came out and said, we blew them up, we burned them, we're not beggars, and blah blah blah.
[00:27:09.064 --> 00:27:10.365]  So we had the moral high ground.
[00:27:10.565 --> 00:27:12.066]  The Russians are sending troops.
[00:27:12.567 --> 00:27:14.028]  The Iranians are sending ships.
[00:27:15.129 --> 00:27:16.610]  The Chinese are sending weapons.
[00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:18.131]  We're sending food.
[00:27:18.351 --> 00:27:21.173]  And then Marco Rubio sends out that damn tweet.
[00:27:22.295 --> 00:27:22.916]  He's a punk!
[00:27:23.296 --> 00:27:24.277]  A little fake wimp!
[00:27:25.198 --> 00:27:26.059]  Who's full of himself!
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:27.421]  Thinks he's so damn cool!
[00:27:28.502 --> 00:27:29.283]  He's the problem.
[00:27:29.523 --> 00:27:32.727]  The Trotskyites were the people kicked out by Stalin.
[00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:35.730]  Marco Rubio is the Trotskyite darling.
[00:27:36.712 --> 00:27:38.033]  The Ferengi ambassador.
[00:27:39.255 --> 00:27:41.817]  Gosh, I wish I would have said, oh, it's the Ferengi ambassador.
[00:27:43.049 --> 00:27:44.369]  When he said, I don't know who you are.
[00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:44.990]  Who are you?
[00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.010]  Like, I'd go, oh, you don't know who I am?
[00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:48.371]  You're saying I don't exist.
[00:27:48.411 --> 00:27:49.251]  I'm deplatformed.
[00:27:49.531 --> 00:27:50.751]  You've sent me to the Phantom Zone.
[00:27:50.831 --> 00:27:55.753]  Oh my god, Marco, I'm a frat boy like you that goes to gay bubble parties.
[00:27:57.533 --> 00:28:02.055]  I'm going to fall down and cry in the corner because I didn't get gangbanged by 50 dudes at a time.
[00:28:02.995 --> 00:28:04.875]  No, I should have said, I know who you are.
[00:28:05.175 --> 00:28:06.536]  You're the Ferengi ambassador.
[00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:08.513]  But anyways, let's get serious.
[00:28:08.773 --> 00:28:10.114]  Here is Chuck Todd.
[00:28:10.134 --> 00:28:10.974]  We'll go out to break with it.
[00:28:11.435 --> 00:28:14.677]  Talking about Trump just wants a PR victory with North Korea.
[00:28:14.877 --> 00:28:16.538]  He's already had a victory, dumb butt.
[00:28:16.698 --> 00:28:17.079]  Here it is.
[00:28:17.819 --> 00:28:19.800]  I think the president's just looking for good press.
[00:28:20.181 --> 00:28:21.261]  I mean, let's just be frank.
[00:28:21.622 --> 00:28:27.866]  He felt like he got a good press after the last one, and he figures another photo op might do that.
[00:28:27.946 --> 00:28:32.929]  But it does look like there's really not a lot to... I mean, I think he wants to be able to say something.
[00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:34.671]  I ended the Korean War, right?
[00:28:34.691 --> 00:28:36.071]  That's technically not happened.
[00:28:37.292 --> 00:28:43.997]  Maybe he walks away from that, but I'll be honest, Willie, it is telling to me that the National Security Advisor John Bolton is not even going.
[00:28:44.057 --> 00:28:44.317]  Right.
[00:28:45.298 --> 00:28:47.840]  Now, he says he's staying back to monitor events in Venezuela.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.061]  Not an insignificant thing going on there.
[00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:50.862]  Don't get me wrong.
[00:28:50.882 --> 00:28:52.483]  Oh, that's enough of this bull.
[00:28:52.503 --> 00:28:55.365]  Yeah, because he's not going because he's not in charge of that.
[00:28:56.346 --> 00:28:59.808]  He is in charge, which is unfortunate of the Venezuela situation.
[00:28:59.848 --> 00:29:00.308]  Stay with us.
[00:29:00.328 --> 00:29:00.809]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:03.027 --> 00:29:08.269]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[00:31:00.061 --> 00:31:01.142]  I want to produce articles.
[00:31:01.322 --> 00:31:05.925]  I want to fight them and not run around trying to make money to fund the operation.

[00:32:04.804 --> 00:32:06.926]  At its regular price, it's a little over $3.
[00:32:07.887 --> 00:32:11.029]  When we have it discounted, it's about $2.50 a piece.
[00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:16.373]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece at Whole Foods.
[00:32:16.754 --> 00:32:17.494]  This is high-end.

[00:32:21.417 --> 00:32:25.521]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[00:32:26.121 --> 00:32:34.550]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[00:32:35.011 --> 00:32:37.253]  It's available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:37.433 --> 00:32:37.814]  It's simple.

[00:33:16.128 --> 00:33:27.892]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:31.753]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.053 --> 00:33:42.916]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see our satellite link to Air Force One taxiing to the main runway to blast off to Southeast Asia.
[00:33:44.668 --> 00:33:47.389]  To Vietnam to meet with Kim Jong-un.
[00:33:48.849 --> 00:33:51.850]  Try to finish this deal to end the Korean War.
[00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:54.971]  To end the armistice, the ceasefire.
[00:33:54.991 --> 00:34:05.314]  And to get him to give up his nuclear weapons so we can free his people and build some hotels and some factories.
[00:34:07.095 --> 00:34:10.676]  South Korea is the most productive country in the world.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:17.243]  Per capita, their citizens are the most wealthy in the world, the most employed in the world.
[00:34:17.523 --> 00:34:19.885]  They have a lot of some of the top statistics.
[00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:28.890]  They also follow rules and take every vaccine recommended, which is about 70 over there, and they have the highest rate of autism.
[00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:31.131]  One in 23.
[00:34:31.351 --> 00:34:36.454]  Might want to know that little fact.
[00:34:37.215 --> 00:34:39.476]  But there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:42.262 --> 00:35:03.821]  Air Force One is in the air and Chuck Todd, I don't normally play clips twice back-to-back, but let's do this one more time because Chuck Todd is beside himself, the Clinton-Obama operative, trying to act like Trump's doing a terrible job on North Korea, trying to act like that this is all just a stunt.
[00:35:05.222 --> 00:35:08.585]  Trump is looking for good press and then he says because Bolton
[00:35:11.826 --> 00:35:14.107]  Man, looks like he has a dust broom for a mustache.
[00:35:17.929 --> 00:35:23.691]  Bolton, the neocon, is staying behind to try to get Venezuelan regime change going.
[00:35:24.952 --> 00:35:27.033]  So because Bolton's not going, this means nothing.
[00:35:27.453 --> 00:35:36.657]  We've already gotten Kim Jong-un to destroy major nuclear sites and to not fire missiles over Japan with Japan-threatening military action.
[00:35:36.897 --> 00:35:38.998]  That's why the Japanese president
[00:35:40.649 --> 00:35:43.390]  has nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.
[00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.431]  And I think Trump does deserve one for trying and getting some success.
[00:35:48.752 --> 00:35:54.013]  I mean, especially if Obama wasn't even in office yet when he was given the Nobel Prize.
[00:35:54.053 --> 00:35:57.894]  And then, of course, Henry Kissinger got one, a warmonger.
[00:35:57.914 --> 00:36:04.356]  I mean, I think President Trump really ought to probably turn it down because they've turned it into a joke, giving one to Al Gore, you name it.
[00:36:04.396 --> 00:36:08.898]  But finally, they could reprieve themselves being avant-garde
[00:36:10.606 --> 00:36:16.228]  And actually supporting someone who's actually trying to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
[00:36:17.289 --> 00:36:18.289]  But I wouldn't hold your breath.
[00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:24.312]  But here's Chuck Todd really having trouble getting it out because he knows it's such bull.
[00:36:24.332 --> 00:36:28.514]  He knows what Trump is doing is so bold, here he is trying to invert reality.
[00:36:29.563 --> 00:36:31.504]  I think the president's just looking for good press.
[00:36:31.905 --> 00:36:32.985]  I mean, let's just be frank.
[00:36:33.325 --> 00:36:44.653]  He felt like he got a good press after the last one, and he figures another photo op might do that, but it does look like there's really not a lot to... I mean, I think he wants to be able to say something.
[00:36:44.773 --> 00:36:46.374]  I ended the Korean War, right?
[00:36:46.394 --> 00:36:47.775]  That's technically not happened.
[00:36:49.015 --> 00:36:49.276]  Notice...
[00:37:17.921 --> 00:37:19.584]  Chuck Todd said, let's be frank.
[00:37:19.704 --> 00:37:20.626]  They always have these little tricks.
[00:37:20.907 --> 00:37:22.069]  Let me be frank with you.
[00:37:23.211 --> 00:37:24.754]  Which means I'm gonna completely lie to you.
[00:37:26.497 --> 00:37:28.641]  Okay, there's almost too much news here for me to cover.
[00:37:29.583 --> 00:37:30.485]  One big tidbit.
[00:37:32.537 --> 00:37:55.897]  That I'm not going to have time to air here today, but that I would direct you to is InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, where our great reporter and her team, Caitlin Bennett, have been truly on fire with two or three big viral reports a day, just going out and doing what Jay Walking did, or doing what Mark Dice did, or doing what I've done and others have done before.
[00:37:55.977 --> 00:37:59.060]  But just illustrating how out of control Democrats are.
[00:38:00.563 --> 00:38:03.425]  There's a new video that's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:38:03.925 --> 00:38:07.568]  Student support concentration camps for Trump supporters.
[00:38:08.709 --> 00:38:12.351]  Almost all of them at the California University she visits.
[00:38:12.912 --> 00:38:21.278]  But there's two new videos today that are even more insane that I'm going to have added to that article that Drudge is linked to.
[00:38:23.342 --> 00:38:24.463]  He played at the start of the show.
[00:38:24.523 --> 00:38:27.965]  She goes out and talks to, looks like 50 people or so.
[00:38:28.265 --> 00:38:30.486]  I didn't count them up, but it's dozens and dozens and dozens.
[00:38:31.547 --> 00:38:34.128]  None of them know who the 45th president is out of 50.
[00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:35.669]  Only two of them do.
[00:38:37.991 --> 00:38:46.476]  And there's another video of standard black Israelite movement that she goes and interviews on the street in California.
[00:38:47.056 --> 00:38:49.938]  And I've been in Houston and I've been in Dallas and I've heard the same group.
[00:38:50.834 --> 00:38:51.774]  For 20, 30 years.
[00:38:52.435 --> 00:38:54.075]  And I was in high school running into these guys.
[00:38:54.735 --> 00:38:57.956]  You'd walk out of the shopping mall and they'd say, It's a white devil!
[00:38:58.917 --> 00:39:04.299]  God will soon kill him soon, the devil seed, the white devil, the cave dweller.
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:17.163]  And when you watch this 10 minute video of them saying this to her, that she needs to die, that she's inherently evil because her skin is pink, and calling her cave dweller,
[00:39:19.226 --> 00:39:38.917]  You have to understand, this is the same religion, or same cult, that was screaming for up to 30 minutes at the Covington kids, and they move away from where they were at the bus stop to another area, and they come over and confront them, and then the media interviews the quote, native elder, who says,
[00:39:40.094 --> 00:39:46.175]  I saw the African-American gentleman and I wanted to protect them from these evil white people.
[00:39:46.735 --> 00:39:47.275]  That's a quote.
[00:39:48.316 --> 00:39:49.036]  He's aggressive.
[00:39:49.776 --> 00:39:56.737]  Meanwhile, he's on the tape with them telling him that he's going to hell.
[00:39:56.757 --> 00:39:59.398]  Because he's not a black Israelite.
[00:40:01.118 --> 00:40:04.899]  So they're on the tape telling the Native Americans and Mexicans and people out there they suck.
[00:40:06.707 --> 00:40:12.869]  And saying we're gonna kill you to the white kids and the media takes that and turns them into the bad guys.
[00:40:13.009 --> 00:40:16.431]  Look, I know you already know all this.
[00:40:17.891 --> 00:40:34.217]  It's just crazy when you actually listen to 10 minutes of them calling her a cave dweller and a subhuman devil and all the rest of it and it just illustrates this whole leftist ideology of saying whites are inherently bad but we've got
[00:40:35.814 --> 00:40:43.557]  MSNBC host will play next segment saying Camilla Harris isn't black enough because her husband's white.
[00:40:46.679 --> 00:40:51.240]  That's like the Nazis saying, you know, well, you're not Jewish, but your husband is.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:53.121]  So you're both going to the concentration camp.
[00:40:53.721 --> 00:40:56.283]  The left is involved right now.
[00:40:56.343 --> 00:40:57.083]  I know you know this.
[00:40:58.971 --> 00:41:00.093]  But it bears repeating.
[00:41:00.153 --> 00:41:08.246]  They're literally converting to the most hardcore, race-based insanity I've ever seen, and it's getting worse by the day.
[00:41:08.266 --> 00:41:10.971]  We're gonna go to Brett and come back with all of that.
[00:41:12.418 --> 00:41:16.081]  Please remember, listeners, that without you supporting us, we won't be here.
[00:41:16.862 --> 00:41:21.946]  And we have a lot of really amazing products at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com that takes you right to the supplements.
[00:41:22.706 --> 00:41:31.353]  And we have some new big specials that we've launched that are very, very exciting, very, very good, high quality products.
[00:41:31.514 --> 00:41:32.354]  Two of our best sellers.
[00:41:32.955 --> 00:41:38.880]  Alpha Power is basically super male vitality, but it's not cold pressed.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.263]  It's a stronger dose, but it is organic.
[00:41:42.303 --> 00:41:43.144]  It's just not cold-pressed.
[00:41:43.984 --> 00:41:46.747]  It technically is way stronger than Supramel Vitality.
[00:41:47.007 --> 00:41:48.529]  A lot of folks still love Supramel Vitality.
[00:41:48.549 --> 00:41:49.049]  I understand why.
[00:41:49.089 --> 00:41:49.690]  It works really good.
[00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:54.695]  But Alpha Power is something really, really strong, really, really good for libido, energy, stamina.
[00:41:54.955 --> 00:41:56.777]  I suggest you get some, men or women.
[00:41:58.479 --> 00:42:01.020]  So we have the InfoWars Life Strength and Recovery Combo.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.241]  InfoWars Life Strength and Recovery Combo.
[00:42:27.881 --> 00:42:35.771]  Containing two of our best-selling products, the InfoWars Life Strength and Recovery Combo is here to help you maximize your workout and support your overall health and wellness.
[00:42:35.791 --> 00:42:36.652]  You really should try it.
[00:42:38.171 --> 00:42:39.912]  Both are good for pre- and post-workout.
[00:42:39.972 --> 00:42:48.974]  M4's Life Strength Recovery Combo contains Alpha Power, the Powerhouse Testosterone Support Formula, and Bodies, our incredible Turmeric Whole Body Support Formula.
[00:42:49.034 --> 00:42:50.074]  Available 50% off.
[00:42:50.414 --> 00:42:51.655]  Did I tell you?
[00:42:51.675 --> 00:42:59.117]  50% off on Alpha Power and Bodies Ultimate Turmeric Formula when you get them together in the combo at m4workshore.com.
[00:42:59.297 --> 00:43:00.817]  No reviews yet on the combo.
[00:43:07.336 --> 00:43:09.118]  Let's go to Megan in Texas.
[00:43:09.158 --> 00:43:09.919]  Megan, you're on the air.
[00:43:09.959 --> 00:43:10.460]  Thanks for holding.
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:10.740]  Go ahead.
[00:43:10.941 --> 00:43:11.301]  Hi, Alex.
[00:43:11.321 --> 00:43:11.842]  How are you today?
[00:43:11.982 --> 00:43:12.383]  I'm awesome.
[00:43:12.403 --> 00:43:13.103]  Thank you for calling.
[00:43:13.143 --> 00:43:14.966]  I'm gonna give you a little bit of my background.
[00:43:14.986 --> 00:43:16.548]  I was born and raised in California.
[00:43:16.688 --> 00:43:18.751]  I lived through the downfall of California.
[00:43:18.891 --> 00:43:24.558]  My husband and I got out of there as soon as we graduated from school, came to Texas because to us it was a passion of freedom.
[00:43:24.718 --> 00:43:29.402]  Man, I'm looking at what's happening to Trump right now, and I'm telling you right now, this whole country's going the way of California.
[00:43:29.422 --> 00:43:30.643]  We're going to be disenfranchised.
[00:43:30.723 --> 00:43:32.825]  If they get him out, that's the gateway right there.
[00:43:32.865 --> 00:43:34.986]  There's no more middle of the country anymore.
[00:43:35.007 --> 00:43:35.967]  We're not going to have a say.
[00:43:35.987 --> 00:43:38.509]  I mean, we're killing babies, and we're poisoning the ones we're not killing.
[00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:45.535]  We're just here in Texas trying to raise our three little girls, and I just... What do you think we're going to... If they manage to get him out, what's our contingency plan?
[00:43:45.555 --> 00:43:46.376]  Where do we go from there?
[00:43:46.536 --> 00:43:50.297]  Megan, I hear the earnestness in your voice, the concern, and I absolutely agree with you.
[00:43:50.617 --> 00:43:53.098]  They hit Europe with 15 million military-age men.
[00:43:53.198 --> 00:43:53.838]  It's collapsed.
[00:43:53.979 --> 00:43:54.839]  They broke their borders.
[00:43:54.879 --> 00:43:55.839]  They're breaking ours.
[00:43:56.019 --> 00:43:56.719]  It's treason.
[00:43:56.839 --> 00:44:00.701]  The governor of New Mexico, the governor of California has pulled National Guard off.
[00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:03.082]  We have tens of thousands, four caravans coming.
[00:44:03.322 --> 00:44:06.543]  Five million have announced they're coming in a major gallop pull.
[00:44:06.723 --> 00:44:08.283]  This is insane.
[00:44:08.463 --> 00:44:09.664]  I mean, it is on.
[00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:12.365]  And again, they're using these people as weapons.
[00:44:12.405 --> 00:44:13.005]  They're saying,
[00:44:13.505 --> 00:44:19.149]  No deal on government shutdown unless you get rid of the 100,000 beds and only make it 16,500.
[00:44:19.389 --> 00:44:22.231]  They're literally saying you can't hold rapists and murderers.
[00:44:22.611 --> 00:44:25.933]  They're saying you can't check who the kids are with or what diseases they have.
[00:44:26.314 --> 00:44:31.677]  This is the lawless, world government breaking of America with the Democrat collaborators running it all.
[00:44:31.957 --> 00:44:32.778]  You're absolutely right.
[00:44:32.878 --> 00:44:47.383]  Yeah, um, I just, I feel like, not only that, my husband and I are both business owners, and I hate to say this, but the brain-dead masses, you try to get through to these people, they're so asleep and zombified, and I just want to say, the people who don't live in border states, they have no clue.
[00:44:47.403 --> 00:44:51.145]  They have no clue what's gonna happen when all these people come in and overrun us.
[00:44:51.225 --> 00:44:52.105]  I've seen it happen.
[00:44:52.145 --> 00:44:55.386]  You can go to the downtown area I grew up in, and it's nothing but Spanish.
[00:44:55.426 --> 00:44:57.507]  You go to the Walmart, everything's in Spanish.
[00:44:57.527 --> 00:44:59.308]  If you didn't know Spanish, you didn't get a job.
[00:44:59.448 --> 00:45:02.690]  This is the globalist plan, and it's absolutely two minutes to midnight.
[00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.792]  California used to be just like Texas.
[00:45:04.872 --> 00:45:06.593]  It's now a collapsing hellhole.
[00:45:06.613 --> 00:45:07.434]  God bless you, Megan.
[00:45:08.594 --> 00:45:11.897]  Megan was on fire, ladies and gentlemen, and her warning is absolutely true.
[00:45:11.917 --> 00:45:12.637]  Are you gonna listen to her?
[00:45:13.738 --> 00:45:17.561]  Because a lot of Texans, a lot of Oklahomans went out to California.
[00:45:19.014 --> 00:45:23.220]  And now they've come back because the state is gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:23.461 --> 00:45:27.186]  We have some affiliates out there, a lot of great people, a beautiful state, but it's gone.
[00:45:27.226 --> 00:45:30.451]  We have to admit, this is the mindset, this is the program into the future.
[00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:37.670]  Well, here's the thing.
[00:45:37.731 --> 00:45:38.491]  I'm not giving up.
[00:45:39.232 --> 00:45:41.093]  Because I know we've got truth and justice on our side.
[00:45:41.133 --> 00:45:43.856]  But it takes money to wage this war.
[00:45:44.236 --> 00:45:45.477]  You're spreading the word.
[00:45:45.517 --> 00:45:46.378]  You're praying for us.
[00:45:46.458 --> 00:45:47.939]  And you're financially supporting us.
[00:45:48.019 --> 00:45:48.840]  It's key.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.560]  It's essential.
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.302]  It's absolute like oxygen.
[00:45:51.602 --> 00:45:52.282]  We have to have it.
[00:45:52.302 --> 00:45:54.484]  And we've got great products you already need.
[00:45:54.504 --> 00:45:55.565]  I mean, take fish oil.
[00:45:55.625 --> 00:45:57.687]  What it does for your heart, your brain, energy.
[00:45:57.787 --> 00:45:59.368]  I don't even usually take a nootropic.
[00:45:59.508 --> 00:46:05.133]  If I'm up at 10 o'clock at night and I've got to work till 3am on Coast to Coast AM or some show, I pop five fish oils.
[00:46:05.433 --> 00:46:06.914]  Nobody calls fish oil nootropic.
[00:46:07.474 --> 00:46:08.655]  Your brain's electrochemical.
[00:46:08.775 --> 00:46:10.996]  It's basically made out of what fish oil is.
[00:46:11.216 --> 00:46:12.576]  Fish oil is what floats my boat.
[00:46:13.497 --> 00:46:14.817]  I mean, I take it every morning right now.
[00:46:15.037 --> 00:46:16.458]  First thing I get up at 6 a.m.
[00:46:16.558 --> 00:46:19.719]  with my coffee, I bang back three big old fat juicy fish oils.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:25.262]  And so our ultimate krill oil is even better than the fish oil, what it does for your brain, but there's no way to denature it.
[00:46:25.322 --> 00:46:26.082]  It gives you the burps.
[00:46:26.102 --> 00:46:28.684]  I'm not gonna lie to you, but if you can deal with it, it's it's it.
[00:46:28.724 --> 00:46:30.844]  The ultimate krill oil is rocket fuel, baby.
[00:46:30.985 --> 00:46:32.005]  I mean, it's the next level.
[00:46:32.365 --> 00:46:33.206]  Ultimate fish oil.
[00:46:33.346 --> 00:46:34.547]  All crafted out of fjords.
[00:46:34.647 --> 00:46:35.087]  Amazing.
[00:46:35.107 --> 00:46:36.188]  Doesn't give you the burpees.
[00:46:36.308 --> 00:46:37.469]  Neither does Honor Roll.
[00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:38.450]  It's amazing for your kids.
[00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:39.171]  Small caplets.
[00:46:39.191 --> 00:46:40.332]  But I tend to like Honor Roll.
[00:46:40.412 --> 00:46:41.673]  Okay, I'm a fish oil addict.
[00:46:41.693 --> 00:46:42.253]  I'm not gonna lie.
[00:46:42.373 --> 00:46:43.214]  I gobble the stuff.
[00:46:43.454 --> 00:46:44.595]  Coffee's a thing of the past now.
[00:46:45.236 --> 00:46:46.477]  Brainforce is a thing of the past.
[00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:48.258]  And for different people, different things.
[00:46:49.119 --> 00:46:52.221]  I'm just telling you, fish oil is numero uno.
[00:46:52.702 --> 00:46:55.824]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or AAA253-3139.
[00:47:07.088 --> 00:47:09.810]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:10.711 --> 00:47:21.660]  He stands like a statue.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.602]  Becomes part of the machine.
[00:47:24.662 --> 00:47:26.083]  Kneeling on the bumpers.
[00:47:26.784 --> 00:47:28.065]  Always playing clean.
[00:47:28.545 --> 00:47:29.946]  Plays by intuition.
[00:47:30.287 --> 00:47:31.908]  The digit counts as four.
[00:47:32.208 --> 00:47:34.730]  That depth of a magnitude.
[00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.191]  Sure plays a mean game.
[00:47:49.162 --> 00:47:50.684]  Money through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:47:50.704 --> 00:47:51.364]  to 3 p.m.
[00:47:51.885 --> 00:48:01.035]  We're here, the most dreaded, most demonized, most lied about broadcast in the world by pirates, by authoritarians, by communists, by socialists, by Hollywood trash, by devil worshipers.
[00:48:02.093 --> 00:48:02.753]  We're hated by them.
[00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:11.196]  I want to get into the Democratic Party, though, and how it mirrors other authoritarian, socialist, and fascist and communist regimes.
[00:48:11.396 --> 00:48:12.296]  Because it's always the same.
[00:48:12.657 --> 00:48:14.637]  It's a cult of power, a cult of dependence.
[00:48:15.177 --> 00:48:16.478]  They want you stupid, they want you done.
[00:48:17.218 --> 00:48:17.478]  Dumb.
[00:48:18.518 --> 00:48:25.641]  Kamala Harris is in a lot of trouble for being a vicious prosecutor in the vein of Hillary Clinton.
[00:48:26.755 --> 00:48:35.951]  Who specifically in the 1990s when they passed the Clinton crime bill would give black people three times the sentences of white people.
[00:48:36.572 --> 00:48:40.539]  Now Trump is reversing that and the media gives him no credit for it.
[00:48:41.701 --> 00:48:45.425]  But Hillary said black people are super predators.
[00:48:46.186 --> 00:48:47.127]  They're like dogs.
[00:48:47.168 --> 00:48:48.549]  They must be brought to heel.
[00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:50.351]  I could play the video clip if you'd like.
[00:48:50.371 --> 00:48:51.633]  She's played it many times.
[00:48:51.693 --> 00:48:52.794]  But she did that.
[00:48:53.295 --> 00:48:56.579]  So if you call blacks dogs, you're loved by the media.
[00:48:56.739 --> 00:48:58.501]  And they try to keep blacks from finding that out.
[00:48:58.521 --> 00:49:00.623]  But people know about Kamala Harris.
[00:49:01.687 --> 00:49:11.080]  And a lot of folks that were out in San Francisco and around her have criticized her, that worked with her, and said she was a vicious authoritarian who really had a mean streak against black people.
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:18.290]  Well, her family was one of the most powerful families of slave owners in Jamaica.
[00:49:19.304 --> 00:49:25.487]  And you do know the first person to get a license in Virginia by the British government for slaves was a black man.
[00:49:26.107 --> 00:49:31.930]  I mean, the idea that only blacks have been slaves or that blacks didn't have black slaves is absolute horse manure.
[00:49:33.191 --> 00:49:39.234]  You read any of the history books, some of the biggest plantation owners in the Caribbean with sugar cane.
[00:49:39.734 --> 00:49:41.915]  That's where you really had the big black slave populations.
[00:49:42.276 --> 00:49:44.657]  Why do you think when you go to the Caribbean there's black people everywhere?
[00:49:45.657 --> 00:49:48.818]  Or you go to Brazil, because they were brought there as slaves!
[00:49:50.778 --> 00:49:52.799]  And a lot of them were owned by black people!
[00:49:53.939 --> 00:49:58.141]  So, that's what we're talking about here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:59.341 --> 00:50:02.482]  And one of the most powerful families in Jamaica is who she comes from.
[00:50:02.522 --> 00:50:06.523]  So it's just, she's married to a white guy, she's a hardcore prosecutor,
[00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:14.215]  And in the age of race baiting that the left pushes, it's all supposed to be about optics.
[00:50:14.235 --> 00:50:24.583]  So here's an MSNBC pundit, full videos up on Infowars.com, saying that, well, you know, she does have a problem because her husband is white.
[00:50:24.663 --> 00:50:25.024]  Here it is.
[00:50:26.584 --> 00:50:26.804]  Okay.
[00:50:53.447 --> 00:50:59.391]  Now let's go to Merman, who is head of a major committee over banking.
[00:50:59.431 --> 00:51:00.271]  I'm sorry, not Merman.
[00:51:02.272 --> 00:51:03.373]  What's its name?
[00:51:04.134 --> 00:51:04.434]  Oh, yeah.
[00:51:05.174 --> 00:51:09.737]  Its husband got tens of millions of dollars stolen from her as a banker bailout.
[00:51:10.237 --> 00:51:11.838]  Maxine Waters.
[00:51:13.559 --> 00:51:16.361]  Maxine Waters says, a black woman's got the gavel.
[00:51:16.901 --> 00:51:17.502]  Look out!
[00:51:17.942 --> 00:51:19.463]  It's going to be heard around the world.
[00:51:19.543 --> 00:51:22.145]  Well, lady, you don't look like a black woman to me.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:28.463]  I mean, you look like the creature from the Black Lagoon, but it had green skin.
[00:51:29.944 --> 00:51:35.529]  So, again, I'm not saying you're the creature because the Black Lagoon's black.
[00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:36.750]  It's a green creature.
[00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:38.471]  But you do look like its cousin.
[00:51:38.491 --> 00:51:41.173]  I mean, you do look like the creature from the Black Lagoon.
[00:51:41.213 --> 00:51:44.756]  I'm sorry, can we pull up the creature from the Black Lagoon and play it next to her?
[00:51:44.776 --> 00:51:46.558]  I mean, I'm not being mean here.
[00:51:46.838 --> 00:51:48.479]  It's just she's so crazy looking.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.442]  Who's the famous black singer?
[00:51:52.671 --> 00:51:55.092]  Who are coming to America!
[00:51:55.212 --> 00:51:56.253]  Yeah, coast to coast!
[00:51:57.794 --> 00:51:58.554]  James Brown!
[00:51:58.915 --> 00:52:02.837]  She looks like a cross between the Creature from the Black Lagoon and James Brown.
[00:52:02.977 --> 00:52:03.697]  It's a fact!
[00:52:04.878 --> 00:52:05.858]  That's what she looks like!
[00:52:06.519 --> 00:52:07.699]  I look like a sea captain!
[00:52:07.719 --> 00:52:11.281]  I mean, that's just... When somebody looks like something, it's... There you go!
[00:52:13.042 --> 00:52:13.663]  There you go!
[00:52:13.843 --> 00:52:17.925]  So... Let's be fair.
[00:52:17.945 --> 00:52:19.126]  She looks more like James Brown.
[00:52:20.711 --> 00:52:21.994]  But James Brown's a little more lovable.
[00:52:22.295 --> 00:52:28.311]  He was a super anti-white racist, but, you know, who else takes five hits to LSD and drives 150 miles an hour in an F-150 pickup?
[00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:30.511]  You kind of got to love that a little bit, don't you?
[00:52:30.531 --> 00:52:33.312]  All right, I'm digressing and I really apologize for getting silly here.
[00:52:35.053 --> 00:52:40.176]  If you did put that wig on the creature from the Black Lagoon's head, it would be a spitting image.
[00:52:40.617 --> 00:52:46.000]  But here she is, she says, she doesn't say the jig is up, she says the gig is up.
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.741]  I don't know who's more senile, her or Nancy Pelosi.
[00:52:49.442 --> 00:52:54.745]  You know, Nancy Pelosi kind of looks like the creature from the Black Lagoon meets It the Clown, right?
[00:52:55.802 --> 00:52:56.903]  Sorry, I'm digressing.
[00:52:57.203 --> 00:52:58.644]  It's not what they look like, it's how they act.
[00:52:58.884 --> 00:53:00.385]  So here she is saying, look out!
[00:53:01.045 --> 00:53:02.566]  A black woman's got the gavel!
[00:53:04.147 --> 00:53:05.208]  The gig is up!
[00:53:06.048 --> 00:53:07.149]  Today is it!
[00:53:19.257 --> 00:53:24.020]  I want this day to go down in honor of Reverend Jesse Jackson.
[00:53:25.464 --> 00:53:28.625]  In ways that is described as this is a new day.
[00:53:28.645 --> 00:53:34.508]  This is a new day and we're not simply begging.
[00:53:35.348 --> 00:53:36.828]  We're not simply pleading.
[00:53:37.249 --> 00:53:39.129]  A black woman has the gavel now.
[00:53:39.149 --> 00:53:41.790]  Yeah, I feel good.
[00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.131]  I got something.
[00:53:44.912 --> 00:53:46.252]  Something that tells me what to do.
[00:53:46.272 --> 00:53:47.673]  Something that tells me what it's all about.
[00:53:47.693 --> 00:53:53.095]  I've been too long, experienced too much, struggled too hard not to use it.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:58.424]  They will hear the sound of my gavel all over the world.
[00:54:00.365 --> 00:54:02.307]  So there you go, we the bosses, we the bosses.
[00:54:02.867 --> 00:54:05.470]  I wish we had a black lady that was pro-gun, pro-free market.
[00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:06.751]  I know lots of black ladies like that.
[00:54:07.171 --> 00:54:09.113]  You are a monster.
[00:54:09.593 --> 00:54:11.295]  Not because you're black, because you're a monster.
[00:54:12.318 --> 00:54:13.739]  Hitler wasn't bad because he was white.
[00:54:14.039 --> 00:54:15.040]  He was bad because he was Hitler.
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:20.565]  Now here's another power-crazed minion saying, hey, I got the gavel and you don't.
[00:54:21.045 --> 00:54:22.026]  I got the microphone.
[00:54:22.306 --> 00:54:23.127]  I'm in charge.
[00:54:23.427 --> 00:54:24.468]  What you gonna do about that?
[00:54:24.948 --> 00:54:26.590]  Talking about AOC, baby.
[00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:30.072]  It's like, you know, it's your worst fear.
[00:54:30.773 --> 00:54:33.175]  It's especially when you feel like imposter syndrome.
[00:54:33.575 --> 00:54:37.699]  It was your worst fear, feeling like someone was going to find you out as like a fraud.
[00:54:38.159 --> 00:54:39.720]  And I read it and I was like, you know what?
[00:54:41.001 --> 00:54:41.862]  I don't care anymore.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:44.180]  I don't care anymore.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.741]  Because, again, I'm at least trying.
[00:54:47.981 --> 00:54:49.721]  And I take methamphetamine every day.
[00:54:50.081 --> 00:54:55.342]  So, the power is in the person who's trying, regardless of the success.
[00:54:55.842 --> 00:54:58.163]  If you're trying, you've got all the power.
[00:54:58.443 --> 00:54:59.743]  You're driving the agenda.
[00:55:00.043 --> 00:55:01.003]  You're doing all this stuff.
[00:55:01.023 --> 00:55:06.824]  Like, I just introduced Green New Deal two weeks ago, and it's creating all of this conversation.
[00:55:07.004 --> 00:55:07.344]  Why?
[00:55:07.645 --> 00:55:09.425]  Because no one else has even tried.
[00:55:10.225 --> 00:55:11.725]  Because no one else has even tried.
[00:55:12.026 --> 00:55:13.866]  So people are like, oh, it's unrealistic.
[00:55:14.306 --> 00:55:15.086]  Oh, it's vague.
[00:55:15.306 --> 00:55:17.567]  Oh, it doesn't address this little minute thing.
[00:55:17.867 --> 00:55:19.307]  And I'm like, you try.
[00:55:19.327 --> 00:55:21.708]  You do it.
[00:55:21.748 --> 00:55:23.549]  Because you're not.
[00:55:24.189 --> 00:55:25.029]  Because you're not.
[00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:28.310]  So until you do it, I'm the boss.
[00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:29.470]  How about that?
[00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:30.491]  I'm the boss.
[00:55:30.751 --> 00:55:31.451]  We the bosses.
[00:55:32.151 --> 00:55:32.911]  Think about that.
[00:55:33.391 --> 00:55:34.492]  We're going to get rid of airplanes.
[00:55:34.572 --> 00:55:35.132]  We don't want to work.
[00:55:35.152 --> 00:55:36.072]  You don't have to work.
[00:55:36.412 --> 00:55:39.333]  And then she tried to say she didn't say that or didn't write that.
[00:55:40.902 --> 00:55:46.865]  And the world's going to end in 12 months, and we can't have kids anymore, and you can't have hamburgers, and Cory Booker's like, listen!
[00:55:47.205 --> 00:55:49.206]  You're not going to be eating meat anymore!
[00:55:49.367 --> 00:55:49.947]  I'm telling you!
[00:55:50.107 --> 00:55:50.747]  Just get ready!
[00:55:52.508 --> 00:55:53.849]  You talk about control freaks!
[00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:56.010]  But that is what socialists do.
[00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:56.751]  They take your food.
[00:55:57.111 --> 00:56:05.275]  So here's actual footage inside the Democratic Party as Maxine Waters and others like AOC announce their takeover.
[00:56:05.435 --> 00:56:08.177]  Here's actual coup discussion footage.
[00:56:08.217 --> 00:56:08.537]  Here it is.
[00:56:14.251 --> 00:56:16.433]  Carlos, what are you up to?
[00:56:17.254 --> 00:56:23.059]  It's called a coup d'etat, which is a French for coup d'etat.
[00:56:23.099 --> 00:56:26.642]  But Carlos, you've been my most trusted number two for years.
[00:56:26.742 --> 00:56:27.262]  Well, guess what?
[00:56:27.443 --> 00:56:29.184]  I am sick of doing number two.
[00:56:29.665 --> 00:56:32.267]  It is our time for number one, yeah?
[00:56:32.547 --> 00:56:33.328]  Oui, dear bosses!
[00:56:33.528 --> 00:56:35.950]  Oui, dear bosses!
[00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:36.711]  Oui, dear bosses!
[00:56:39.136 --> 00:56:44.660]  Okay, I wish you were a boss that believed in lower taxes for the average person, less regulation.
[00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:48.763]  Oh, but China has lower taxes than us, and no regulation.
[00:56:49.023 --> 00:56:50.264]  And you wonder why they're so successful.
[00:56:51.545 --> 00:57:03.232]  We've been set up, we've been sold out, and this woman's offering people free healthcare, free school, free reparations, and quote, if you're unable to work or don't want to work, you get a free paycheck.
[00:57:03.993 --> 00:57:06.014]  Wow, that sounds like a disaster, doesn't it?
[00:57:07.515 --> 00:57:08.096]  Oh my gosh.
[00:57:10.273 --> 00:57:14.498]  Don't worry though, she says eat fewer hamburgers and she's backed by people like Bloomberg.
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.222]  And yeah, a lot of us probably should eat fewer hamburgers.
[00:57:18.242 --> 00:57:20.004]  I had one for breakfast, I can't help it.
[00:57:20.425 --> 00:57:21.025]  But you know what?
[00:57:21.206 --> 00:57:26.412]  I don't need you, Mrs. Meth Mouth, to tell me you could eat a few more hamburgers, lady.
[00:57:27.072 --> 00:57:27.893]  You used to look good.
[00:57:28.154 --> 00:57:29.796]  You look like a damn crack whore now.
[00:57:30.916 --> 00:57:31.736]  Get yourself together!
[00:57:31.756 --> 00:57:34.798]  All right, we'll be right back with our number two big guest lined up.
[00:57:35.038 --> 00:57:36.078]  Haven't told you about those yet.
[00:57:36.139 --> 00:57:36.819]  Summon Studio.
[00:57:37.139 --> 00:57:38.540]  Big surprises coming up in the next two days.
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:42.942]  And don't forget, a bunch of big super combo deals at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:57:43.162 --> 00:57:45.983]  Get some t-shirts, get some water filters, support the InfoWar.
[00:57:46.223 --> 00:57:48.084]  We are fighting the globalists toe-to-toe.
[00:57:48.304 --> 00:57:49.425]  Without you, they're gonna win.
[00:57:49.605 --> 00:57:51.366]  With your help, we all win together!
[00:57:52.944 --> 00:57:54.264]  Patriots are on the go.
[00:57:54.865 --> 00:57:59.046]  Hard-working Americans need high-quality energy when they're on the run.
[00:57:59.587 --> 00:58:09.890]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with the highest quality protein bar in vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter at InfoWorksLife.com.
[00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:13.852]  This is a high-end bar sold for up to six, seven dollars at Whole Foods.
[00:58:14.112 --> 00:58:15.332]  Similar bars, it's high-end.
[00:58:15.933 --> 00:58:18.814]  Normally we sell it for three dollars a piece when you get it in the box.
[00:58:19.474 --> 00:58:22.915]  But with the discount we're running right now as an introductory offer, it's $2.40 a bar.
[00:58:23.215 --> 00:58:24.095]  No one can top that.
[00:58:24.455 --> 00:58:26.556]  And it funds liberty and the fight against the globalists.
[00:58:26.896 --> 00:58:36.859]  Get your InfoWarsLife protein bars today with 15 grams of protein and so much more at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:58:37.039 --> 00:58:37.619]  They're amazing.
[00:58:38.159 --> 00:58:41.860]  America is under globalist attack, but we've been having major victories.
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:45.501]  Their criminal EU is on the verge of literally collapsing.
[00:58:46.081 --> 00:58:50.363]  But the globalists are attempting to shut down independent media here in the United States.
[00:58:50.724 --> 00:58:54.186]  They're trying to shut down InfoWars as their number one enemy because we're so effective.
[00:58:54.586 --> 00:58:58.148]  And when you buy products at InfoWarsLife.com, you fund the whole operation.

[00:59:07.233 --> 00:59:12.476]  They're high-end bars that would be sold for six, seven bucks at Whole Foods for as low as $2.40 a piece at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:15.037 --> 00:59:22.101]  Take advantage of this, see how great they are, and help fund the InfoWar to take down the globalists all at the same time at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:24.642]  Go get your high-quality coffee at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:59:25.243 --> 00:59:31.126]  Go get the things that you need for you and your family, like high-quality fish oil, or these protein bars, or Toe Burger Force, and then...
[00:59:31.946 --> 00:59:36.852]  You get great products at great prices and stop the globalists from shutting us down in our critical fight against them.
[00:59:37.092 --> 00:59:37.833]  It's that simple.
[00:59:38.053 --> 00:59:41.557]  I'm very, very proud of the M4's Life protein bars that we've launched.
[00:59:41.838 --> 00:59:43.440]  Again, they are the highest quality.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:44.601]  It's a total win-win.
[00:59:44.621 --> 00:59:45.402]  M4slife.com.
[00:59:57.046 --> 01:00:01.327]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:02.027 --> 01:00:03.808]  Wow!
[01:00:04.908 --> 01:00:08.629]  I feel good!
[01:00:08.649 --> 01:00:11.930]  I knew that I wouldn't.
[01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:15.251]  I feel good!
[01:00:15.271 --> 01:00:16.972]  I knew that I wouldn't.
[01:00:16.992 --> 01:00:18.532]  So good!
[01:00:18.552 --> 01:00:19.612]  So good!
[01:00:28.387 --> 01:00:29.827]  That's Maxine Waters.
[01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:39.970]  If she wants you to know, she's getting close to the nuclear weapons arsenal.
[01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:43.750]  Alright, let's get serious.
[01:00:56.545 --> 01:01:04.109]  You know, we can look at AOC, we can look at Maxine Waters, we can look at Nancy Pelosi, and we can say, what planet do people like Michael Morgan and these folks come from?
[01:01:04.529 --> 01:01:05.690]  And we know where they come from.
[01:01:07.591 --> 01:01:08.831]  Big blue toilet bowls.
[01:01:11.593 --> 01:01:25.520]  Every statistic on the planet is socialist and communist and leftist areas have super ultra rich perched on top of them with mindless mobs of drug addicts, needles and human feces and bankruptcy all around them.
[01:01:28.322 --> 01:01:52.462]  And then I do need to go tell some of the video researchers and editors, we've got to take that six minute piece I never got to yesterday of Bill Maher putting down flyover country as a hellhole and saying that everyone in flyover country wants to live in California or in New York.
[01:01:54.005 --> 01:01:55.506]  Total inversion of reality.
[01:01:55.726 --> 01:01:57.488]  Because all the statistics show the opposite.
[01:01:57.528 --> 01:02:06.955]  Everyone's fleeing from the East Coast and the West Coast, the Northeast, to the South, and to the Midwest, and to Texas.
[01:02:07.836 --> 01:02:12.219]  And everyone's fleeing from the West Coast towards Texas.
[01:02:12.239 --> 01:02:15.742]  I mean, hell, they're having booms in Nebraska.
[01:02:17.664 --> 01:02:20.266]  I left for Nebraska to visit my wife's dad.
[01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:28.932]  And the people are all super nice, and they've got big, nice houses on lakes, and they're just middle-class people.
[01:02:30.152 --> 01:02:35.494]  And, you know, you look over and their neighbors have got a big, nice house, and they're black, and other neighbors are, you know, Chinese.
[01:02:35.514 --> 01:02:36.735]  They're all just Americans.
[01:02:37.255 --> 01:02:40.836]  And there's just highways being built, and businesses and factories everywhere.
[01:02:41.156 --> 01:02:47.798]  And that's all because, oh yeah, everybody's fleeing here from New Jersey, New York, California.
[01:02:50.745 --> 01:02:52.126]  And they're having a boom up there.
[01:02:53.347 --> 01:02:55.128]  And you go other places and they're having booms.
[01:02:55.548 --> 01:03:02.092]  Because people are getting the hell out of California especially.
[01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:04.353]  You're like, well California's population keeps going.
[01:03:04.433 --> 01:03:08.736]  Oh no, they're replacing it with the lowest skilled, lowest IQ people.
[01:03:10.555 --> 01:03:13.277]  There's not a brain drain happening out of Latin America.
[01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:16.659]  There's rich ruling class there, super rich people, the whole place.
[01:03:16.979 --> 01:03:25.786]  I mean, you go to Mexico, you go to the nice areas, there's all these rich people, and they're all, you know, living better than rich people in the U.S., but there's a giant permanent underclass.
[01:03:28.627 --> 01:03:30.429]  And that's the system we're moving into.
[01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:36.293]  And so the permanent underclass is moving here.
[01:03:38.152 --> 01:03:39.832]  Or we're just purely exploited, you know.
[01:03:39.852 --> 01:03:42.033]  I mean, I talk about this a lot, but it's incredible.
[01:03:42.653 --> 01:03:46.054]  For at least five years, the number one group coming to the U.S.
[01:03:46.274 --> 01:03:49.954]  legally is not Mexicans.
[01:03:51.035 --> 01:03:52.375]  It's Chinese women.
[01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:54.395]  Maybe we'll clash.
[01:03:55.336 --> 01:04:01.757]  Their government encourages them to fly here a month before they give birth, check into a hotel,
[01:04:02.759 --> 01:04:15.513]  They'll have the baby, have it all paid for as an anchor baby, say, I don't have insurance, I'm just here visiting, and then the baby, the $30,000 birth is paid for on average, and the kid is a U.S.
[01:04:15.533 --> 01:04:15.973]  citizen.
[01:04:19.137 --> 01:04:24.483]  And then they sign up for a bunch of welfare, and the woman stays here.
[01:04:25.615 --> 01:04:32.737]  And usually the Chinese businessman goes back and forth doing his Chinese business, and then his house, and his car, and his U.S.
[01:04:32.797 --> 01:04:33.958]  base is all paid for.
[01:04:34.378 --> 01:04:36.559]  And it's a subsidy the Chinese government has.
[01:04:36.579 --> 01:04:47.142]  I remember like six, seven years ago, Walmart internal memo came out where they told employees, oh no, we don't pay you enough to actually be out of poverty because we want you to be able to get welfare too, and then you'll have a better life.
[01:04:47.202 --> 01:04:50.223]  No, Walmart subsidized by food stamps and welfare.
[01:04:51.164 --> 01:04:51.864]  It's the same crap!
[01:04:53.072 --> 01:04:55.998]  That's why all these big billionaires are for socialism and communism.
[01:04:56.479 --> 01:04:58.544]  It's because they all get government incentives.
[01:04:59.105 --> 01:05:00.748]  They all get government kickbacks.
[01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:01.630]  It's all rigged.
[01:05:04.085 --> 01:05:09.307]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[01:05:09.647 --> 01:05:11.728]  Alpha Power at 50% off.

[01:06:06.572 --> 01:06:12.730]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:56.931 --> 01:06:58.051]  Okay, here's what I want to do.
[01:06:58.071 --> 01:07:05.154]  I got a ton of news, a bunch of clips I want to get to on this Monday, February 25th, 2019, global transmission.
[01:07:06.035 --> 01:07:11.657]  But I want to open the phones up specifically on Trump and the North Korea second summit.
[01:07:13.021 --> 01:07:16.222]  Do you think it's a victory for America and for Trump?
[01:07:17.482 --> 01:07:19.422]  Do you think Kim Jong-un is playing us?
[01:07:20.942 --> 01:07:30.124]  I just know the globalists have that ongoing strategy of, quote, patience, where they want to keep the peninsula locked up, let China take control of North Korea, keep it suppressed.
[01:07:31.544 --> 01:07:31.984]  If the U.S.
[01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:41.566]  could cut North Korea out from the CHICOMS and industrialize it and get their establishment to free their people and become incredibly rich in the process,
[01:07:45.302 --> 01:07:59.552]  Then even a crony capitalist model like that would be light years better than living under a Stalinist nightmare that's 50 years in the past with abuse and torture and things just unprecedented.
[01:08:00.813 --> 01:08:05.676]  So I see this as a big gamble of the president and I see it as him being a trailblazer.
[01:08:09.189 --> 01:08:10.270]  Do you think it'll be successful?
[01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:13.672]  He's already got them to stop firing the missiles and at least destroy some nuclear sites.
[01:08:14.093 --> 01:08:14.913]  That's a big start.
[01:08:15.714 --> 01:08:18.816]  Now we don't have, you know, the North and the South shooting at each other every few days.
[01:08:18.836 --> 01:08:23.440]  So there's already been a giant de-escalation 50 plus years after the ceasefire.
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:28.864]  And to see Chuck Todd and others saying, oh, this is just Trump grandstanding for publicity, that's not true.
[01:08:28.924 --> 01:08:30.325]  He's taking a major risk here.
[01:08:33.347 --> 01:08:34.388]  So we'll talk about that subject.
[01:08:34.428 --> 01:08:35.689]  What do you think about Venezuela?
[01:08:35.909 --> 01:08:38.211]  That's probably even more important in the immediate future.
[01:08:39.113 --> 01:08:41.755]  Maduro has staged these elections.
[01:08:41.795 --> 01:08:42.476]  He's been caught.
[01:08:42.496 --> 01:08:47.099]  Hugo Chavez robbed the population, destroyed the country.
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:50.382]  Now you've got food convoys that Maduro took credit for.
[01:08:50.402 --> 01:08:54.745]  I thought it could have been a false flag by Colombia or something.
[01:08:54.765 --> 01:09:01.710]  Because Colombia really doesn't like, you know, its neighbor Venezuela flooding them with crime and refugees and all the rest of it.
[01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:07.615]  So Maduro has Russian troops, Chinese troops, Iranian ships coming in.
[01:09:07.655 --> 01:09:08.816]  This is a big escalation.
[01:09:10.877 --> 01:09:14.818]  And Maduro's taking credit saying, we will not be beggars.
[01:09:15.358 --> 01:09:16.719]  We blew up these trucks.
[01:09:16.759 --> 01:09:18.259]  We're not taking America's food.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:24.421]  So he deserves just for that to be removed.
[01:09:24.481 --> 01:09:27.842]  But you've seen how regime change always goes bad.
[01:09:27.862 --> 01:09:33.224]  Because the neocons who are involved in this with the Democrats, they never want to see something fixed.
[01:09:34.517 --> 01:09:35.777]  They like a strategy of tension.
[01:09:35.817 --> 01:09:36.918]  They like to stir the pot.
[01:09:37.358 --> 01:09:40.859]  They want the crisis to continue, like what they've done in the Middle East and North Africa.
[01:09:41.999 --> 01:09:43.199]  And the whole Arab Spring.
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:52.042]  So I don't trust Bolton and some of these other guys that are involved.
[01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:55.223]  But regardless, Maduro is so bad.
[01:09:56.243 --> 01:10:02.165]  That's why it's a terrible thing that the Ferengi ambassador, Marco Rubio,
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.604]  Tweeted at Maduro.
[01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:12.754]  And basically put out a tweet showing Gaddafi alive.
[01:10:12.774 --> 01:10:15.559]  And then Gaddafi being tortured to death.
[01:10:18.117 --> 01:10:24.843]  By the Al-Qaeda forces that, as a neocon, he supported Hillary in sending in to blow that country up and have regime change.
[01:10:25.383 --> 01:10:31.248]  After he'd made a deal with us eight years before, invested in the West, and opened himself up to the West, and thought Obama was his friend.
[01:10:31.708 --> 01:10:32.729]  Total betrayal.
[01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:33.670]  That was evil.
[01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:35.031]  That's bad regime change.
[01:10:35.332 --> 01:10:43.178]  And so when the same people, like Marco Rubio, are supporting getting rid of Maduro, it just makes me wonder.
[01:10:44.099 --> 01:10:45.460]  Because I want to see Maduro gone.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:46.321]  Venezuela.
[01:10:48.629 --> 01:10:57.773]  Was always in first or second place in the world, or in this hemisphere, as the richest country in the Americas.
[01:10:58.733 --> 01:11:04.456]  From Alaska down to the tip of Chile, it was as wealthy as the U.S.
[01:11:04.516 --> 01:11:05.496]  or wealthier on average.
[01:11:05.516 --> 01:11:10.278]  The average person had an income higher than the people in the U.S.
[01:11:10.578 --> 01:11:11.359]  until the 60s.
[01:11:12.279 --> 01:11:16.381]  Same thing for Argentina, the Argentines.
[01:11:19.099 --> 01:11:32.247]  And Argentina now has been wrecked and never came out of it because the bankers come in, they get you in their monetary fractional reserve system, they set you up, they destroy middle classes to control and dominate and vertically integrate society.
[01:11:34.368 --> 01:11:37.530]  And so I want to see Maduro gone.
[01:11:39.551 --> 01:11:41.792]  It's a horrible communist regime, not just socialist.
[01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:44.554]  But I don't know.
[01:11:45.754 --> 01:11:46.574]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:11:46.614 --> 01:11:47.515]  Here's some of these headlines.
[01:11:47.535 --> 01:11:53.258]  After Venezuelan troops block aid, Maduro faces diplomatic siege.
[01:11:55.499 --> 01:11:56.359]  Shocking intel.
[01:11:57.019 --> 01:12:01.141]  U.S., and this is true, is mashing troops and weapons in Colombia.
[01:12:01.461 --> 01:12:04.363]  That's why Mike Pence, the vice president, is there right now.
[01:12:04.383 --> 01:12:06.884]  That's just some.
[01:12:08.379 --> 01:12:08.639]  Of course.
[01:12:29.076 --> 01:12:30.157]  And then make them come to you.
[01:12:30.177 --> 01:12:35.540]  I mean, Venezuela has volcanic soil, all the timber, all the minerals, the oil.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.482]  It's one of the richest countries in the world.
[01:12:40.143 --> 01:12:40.823]  For resources.
[01:12:42.004 --> 01:12:43.565]  That's why its people were so wealthy.
[01:12:44.225 --> 01:12:46.146]  But that's all in the past now, isn't it?
[01:12:47.107 --> 01:12:51.409]  And don't worry, Maduro and all these guys and Chavez sold out to big multinationals.
[01:12:51.469 --> 01:12:53.711]  Big companies came in and extracted it all.
[01:12:53.951 --> 01:12:55.512]  They got rid of the local rich people.
[01:12:56.377 --> 01:13:01.861]  And they brought in the multinationals and they've all got their Swiss chateaus and their Luxembourg castles.
[01:13:04.782 --> 01:13:08.205]  And if Maduro makes it out of there alive, Rubio's saying he won't.
[01:13:09.625 --> 01:13:10.646]  He'll run off to Switzerland.
[01:13:11.667 --> 01:13:16.590]  Just like all these other Latin American presidents who you always find out get hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes.
[01:13:19.372 --> 01:13:21.093]  So here's some of that carnage.
[01:13:22.942 --> 01:13:32.299]  Friend of MTN24, at this moment, a humanitarian aid gondola is being set on fire after the Bolivarian National Police has detonated tear gas bombs at the gondola and they are being set on fire.
[01:13:37.737 --> 01:13:40.179]  And then Maduro took credit for this.
[01:13:40.219 --> 01:13:41.540]  By the way, I don't just believe CNN.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.703]  I went to the Venezuelan newspapers, and he took credit.
[01:13:44.743 --> 01:13:46.885]  You got trucks with red crosses on them,
[01:14:06.721 --> 01:14:07.862]  Let's burn these up.
[01:14:09.602 --> 01:14:17.086]  You've got the truck drivers trying to get the tractors unhooked from the trailers before they burn up.
[01:14:18.667 --> 01:14:22.169]  And then the scenes, there's more scenes of the military shooting people.
[01:14:23.549 --> 01:14:25.410]  So yeah, this is like Ceaușescu's Romania.
[01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:33.294]  It's like Russia before its revolution in 91, under Gorbachev, who was a globalist puppet.
[01:14:33.934 --> 01:14:34.855]  It's like any of these countries.
[01:14:35.731 --> 01:14:36.972]  The people deserve freedom.
[01:14:38.252 --> 01:14:39.633]  But I want to know listeners' views.
[01:14:39.773 --> 01:14:41.794]  I want to get your view on all of this.
[01:14:41.814 --> 01:14:49.317]  Yeah, show them the footage of the Venezuelan troops kicking the truck drivers out and then burning them down.
[01:14:52.078 --> 01:15:03.984]  And think of the courage it would take out of Colombia to drive in to Venezuela knowing that the military is waiting to burn up your vehicle or shoot you.
[01:15:06.567 --> 01:15:07.568]  And you gotta hand it to Venezuela.
[01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:08.748]  They didn't even steal the food.
[01:15:08.789 --> 01:15:10.209]  They just blew it up and burned it.
[01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:12.091]  There's hours of this footage.
[01:15:13.272 --> 01:15:14.192]  I wanna get your take on it all.
[01:15:14.232 --> 01:15:15.113]  What do we do about Venezuela?
[01:15:15.853 --> 01:15:21.037]  I mean, it's immoral if we don't do something because it's causing the collapse of Latin America into the U.S.
[01:15:22.455 --> 01:15:26.457]  Long before globalism, we sent troops into Mexico repeatedly when it was collapsing into us.
[01:15:26.597 --> 01:15:30.079]  I don't want this to happen, but, I mean, we're in an emergency here.
[01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:33.541]  But do you feel good with John Bolton and the neocons like flying monkeys?
[01:15:34.121 --> 01:15:34.862]  Flying around up there?
[01:15:34.922 --> 01:15:36.643]  I don't feel good about it.
[01:15:36.723 --> 01:15:39.004]  I've got a bad feeling.
[01:15:39.024 --> 01:15:39.224]  800-259-9231.
[01:15:39.444 --> 01:15:40.305]  Because they're evil.
[01:15:40.685 --> 01:15:42.946]  And they always have to take one thing and make it worse.
[01:15:43.466 --> 01:15:44.107]  Like the Middle East.
[01:15:44.127 --> 01:15:44.647]  800-259-9231. 800.
[01:15:49.781 --> 01:15:50.843]  Phone you the number when we come back.
[01:15:50.923 --> 01:15:51.584]  I'm so out of touch.
[01:15:51.605 --> 01:15:52.326]  Give me the old DC number.
[01:15:52.687 --> 01:15:53.027]  It's 877-789-ALEX.
[01:15:53.047 --> 01:15:53.328]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:53.628]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:15:53.648 --> 01:15:54.470]  That's the right number.

[01:18:56.314 --> 01:18:56.454]  Yep!
[01:19:03.547 --> 01:19:04.888]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:19:04.968 --> 01:19:06.749]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:19:06.869 --> 01:19:07.290]  It is.
[01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:11.873]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:19:12.353 --> 01:19:13.634]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:19:13.714 --> 01:19:15.455]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:19:15.515 --> 01:19:17.837]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:19:18.017 --> 01:19:21.039]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:19:21.099 --> 01:19:22.320]  You've got the children's.
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:23.421]  You've got the adults.
[01:19:23.581 --> 01:19:24.482]  You've got the krill oil.
[01:19:24.582 --> 01:19:27.944]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[01:19:27.984 --> 01:19:30.346]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[01:19:30.606 --> 01:19:31.747]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:19:31.887 --> 01:19:32.568]  And I'm just sorry.
[01:19:32.668 --> 01:19:33.648]  You want something like this?
[01:19:33.749 --> 01:19:34.609]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:36.591]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:19:36.651 --> 01:19:37.171]  It's so good.
[01:19:37.251 --> 01:19:37.772]  In my view.
[01:19:37.872 --> 01:19:40.074]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[01:19:40.094 --> 01:19:44.517]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:19:46.299 --> 01:19:50.843]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:19:53.803 --> 01:19:59.629]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:00.610]  I just can't do it!
[01:20:06.477 --> 01:20:09.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:28.587 --> 01:20:30.768]  Alex Jones here, back live, about to go to your phone calls.
[01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:38.673]  The United States is on the verge of war with the communist dictatorship of Venezuela.
[01:20:38.713 --> 01:20:39.954]  It's already a failed state.
[01:20:40.494 --> 01:20:44.096]  Over a thousand a week, according to Amnesty International, starved to death.
[01:20:44.837 --> 01:20:49.680]  Three years ago, a Venezuelan dictator made it illegal to report on the starvation.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:54.523]  They use starvation and lack of medicine as a tool of control and loyalty to the party.
[01:20:55.876 --> 01:20:59.697]  Now the poorest areas that were under their control have been rebelling.
[01:20:59.717 --> 01:21:04.079]  They've been torturing and shooting and killing the indigenous peoples.
[01:21:05.199 --> 01:21:07.300]  I want Maduro to be removed.
[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:09.661]  I know they staged these elections.
[01:21:11.414 --> 01:21:23.440]  There's Vice President Mike Pence just hours ago meeting with the man that many polls showed was the real winner of the last election who's had to flee the country because there's a death warrant out for him by the dictator Maduro.
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.461]  So I want Maduro out.
[01:21:26.101 --> 01:21:27.042]  I hate communism.
[01:21:27.522 --> 01:21:31.204]  I can't stand people like Sean Penn talking about how great Venezuela is.
[01:21:31.424 --> 01:21:33.945]  Then go live down there, you horrible little bastard!
[01:21:34.906 --> 01:21:36.327]  You little spoiled rotten rat!
[01:21:37.107 --> 01:21:38.608]  You and AOC and the rest of you!
[01:21:39.858 --> 01:21:42.118]  Michael Moore, go to Venezuela, they'll probably eat you!
[01:21:42.138 --> 01:21:43.999]  You can feed a family for a month!
[01:21:45.479 --> 01:21:46.119]  Land whale!
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:50.380]  I'm not fat shaming, I'm saying they're starving to death.
[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:59.062]  I saw a UN number, which are pretty accurate on the ground, that the average Venezuelan last year lost 26 pounds.
[01:21:59.822 --> 01:22:00.182]  Is it 23 or 26?
[01:22:00.662 --> 01:22:01.142]  Pull that up.
[01:22:01.682 --> 01:22:03.723]  How much weight the average Venezuelan lost in 2018?
[01:22:06.141 --> 01:22:11.125]  And man, you look at the videos of the protest, I mean, these are some skinny people now.
[01:22:12.587 --> 01:22:20.373]  You look at who's arriving here, and a lot of these caravans, they look like they didn't ever miss an all-you-could-eat buffet three times a day.
[01:22:24.077 --> 01:22:25.458]  I went from memory, I said 26 or 23, it's 24 pounds.
[01:22:25.478 --> 01:22:28.901]  24 pounds, Reuters reports, from poverty studies.
[01:22:34.901 --> 01:22:36.341]  That's what communism is.
[01:22:36.741 --> 01:22:38.262]  That's what it always ends up doing.
[01:22:38.482 --> 01:22:38.962]  Always!
[01:22:41.402 --> 01:22:47.864]  But, John Bolton's a neocon who helped engineer all the failures in Iraq and the Arab Spring with the Democrats.
[01:22:48.484 --> 01:22:49.884]  John Bolton's is bad!
[01:22:51.304 --> 01:22:53.865]  With some of the policies he's pushed, it's people like Maduro.
[01:22:54.825 --> 01:22:56.685]  And John Bolton's not even one of the worst neocons.
[01:22:57.926 --> 01:22:59.966]  You get into David Frum,
[01:23:01.438 --> 01:23:09.421]  And you get into Max Boot, and you get into Crystal, and you get into all of these other Creepozoids.
[01:23:09.741 --> 01:23:15.964]  They're the ones involved with the Democrats running the internet censorships, and NewsGuard, and all the police state crap.
[01:23:17.284 --> 01:23:20.445]  They're the more competent group in the government of carrying out tyranny.
[01:23:20.545 --> 01:23:21.526]  They're the problem!
[01:23:24.127 --> 01:23:24.447]  And so...
[01:23:27.325 --> 01:23:34.550]  I care about the President, I like Pence, and I think they're a governing force over the neocons, because that's who's in charge in government, so they might as well co-opt the neocons.
[01:23:34.971 --> 01:23:39.274]  But I don't want the neocons co-opting Trump.
[01:23:41.436 --> 01:23:53.406]  And so I like what Trump said, an aid package, an emergency system to go in, if they accept it, which Maduro's going to give an ultimatum, let an international peace group in.
[01:23:53.786 --> 01:23:55.828]  I don't like the UN, but it's better than a war.
[01:23:56.946 --> 01:24:02.850]  And come in, stabilize, and have a new election.
[01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:05.391]  But you know, Maduro's not going to do that.
[01:24:06.232 --> 01:24:07.873]  And the Russian troops are pouring in.
[01:24:10.814 --> 01:24:12.155]  The Cuban troops are already there.
[01:24:12.815 --> 01:24:14.316]  The Chinese weapons are coming in.
[01:24:14.897 --> 01:24:16.658]  The Iranian gunboats are arriving.
[01:24:16.738 --> 01:24:19.579]  And now they're in our hemisphere, in our backyard.
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:20.820]  I know Trump.
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:21.981]  I know the Pentagon.
[01:24:23.464 --> 01:24:31.869]  I think within a week you're going to have C-130s going around with their howitzers hanging out the windows and their miniguns vaporizing Maduro's people.
[01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:40.094]  And if the Russians follow their previous activity, which is not in their hemisphere, they will probably withdraw and only be advisors.
[01:24:40.154 --> 01:24:42.255]  But a bunch of Russians are about to get killed.
[01:24:42.595 --> 01:24:43.355]  You can bet that.
[01:24:44.676 --> 01:24:47.038]  You can bet the satellites have already picked all the targets.
[01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:50.980]  But I would expect this will not go as well as
[01:24:52.475 --> 01:24:53.856]  Removing Manuel Noriega.
[01:24:54.857 --> 01:25:00.702]  And that was done purely because he was threatening to expose CIA drug trafficking if they cut his money out.
[01:25:01.842 --> 01:25:04.805]  And they said some women at a U.S.
[01:25:04.865 --> 01:25:05.986]  university got kidnapped.
[01:25:06.066 --> 01:25:06.826]  None of it was true.
[01:25:07.207 --> 01:25:08.568]  Panama deception, it tells it all.
[01:25:09.569 --> 01:25:10.970]  I was not for the Panama War.
[01:25:11.730 --> 01:25:12.951]  This, though, will be different.
[01:25:12.971 --> 01:25:14.312]  There will be casualties.
[01:25:14.773 --> 01:25:15.593]  There will be U.S.
[01:25:15.613 --> 01:25:16.234]  troops killed.
[01:25:17.395 --> 01:25:18.456]  This will be a bloodbath.
[01:25:19.355 --> 01:25:29.357]  And it looks like the deal's been made, at least on the surface, between Pence and the opposition leader who's living in exile in Colombia.
[01:25:30.097 --> 01:25:31.778]  So we'll see how all this unfolds.
[01:25:32.118 --> 01:25:33.278]  I want to get your take on it.
[01:25:34.998 --> 01:25:38.239]  When we come back, on the other side, Putin has issued a warning.
[01:25:38.799 --> 01:25:41.200]  Russia TV lists nuclear targets in the U.S.
[01:25:42.216 --> 01:25:43.617]  That's after his warning on this.
[01:25:44.117 --> 01:25:48.159]  So things are deteriorating very, very, very, very quickly.
[01:25:48.199 --> 01:25:50.020]  In fact, I saw that this morning.
[01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:50.620]  I forgot to cover it.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.360]  Please print me that.
[01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:53.481]  That should be our top story at Infowars.com.
[01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:57.943]  After Putin warning, Russia TV lists nuclear targets in the U.S.
[01:25:57.983 --> 01:26:03.946]  So Russia is now broadcasting targets for nuclear war inside the U.S.
[01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:08.108]  See, we're not really just at war with Venezuela.
[01:26:10.282 --> 01:26:11.722]  Wow, that's a whole other subject right there.
[01:26:12.382 --> 01:26:13.043]  Holy Toledo.
[01:26:13.163 --> 01:26:14.463]  It's just, it's all unraveling.
[01:26:15.223 --> 01:26:20.004]  It's out of control and Trump's trying to get peace over in Vietnam while all this is unfolding.
[01:26:21.364 --> 01:26:31.306]  And imagine the mindset of people that are starving to death and willing to stand up to soldiers with guns.
[01:26:32.147 --> 01:26:33.867]  This is just unraveling very, very quickly.
[01:26:34.087 --> 01:26:35.047]  We'll talk about when we come back.
[01:26:35.067 --> 01:26:35.107]  877-789-2539.
[01:26:41.206 --> 01:26:52.053]  We have joining us in studio, Robert Barnes, who is the lead lawyer here in our operations now, really tightening a bead on the globalists for a stratagem of victory.
[01:26:53.914 --> 01:26:59.037]  And he's going to be talking to a man that he repeatedly got found not guilty.
[01:27:00.078 --> 01:27:04.881]  Joe Bannister, former Treasury agent, they tried to put in prison for exposing the IRS's crimes.
[01:27:06.052 --> 01:27:10.055]  Well, liberal juries repeatedly found him not guilty, thanks to Robert Barnes.
[01:27:10.595 --> 01:27:12.897]  And the truth, they'll both be with us today.
[01:27:12.997 --> 01:27:17.680]  Joe via Skype, Robert Barnes in studio, then Owen Benjamin will also be joining us.
[01:27:18.461 --> 01:27:32.491]  Now, please don't forget that we're an information war, and the globalists are trying as hard as they can to keep you from communicating, and to keep you from speaking out, and to keep you from involving yourself in the community.
[01:27:33.362 --> 01:27:36.124]  And there's a continuum here, kind of like choose your own adventure.
[01:27:36.485 --> 01:27:46.032]  If you want to wear a red Make America Great Again hat, you might get your lunch bought for you in red areas, but you might get stabbed or hit over the head with a 2x4 in blue areas.
[01:27:46.733 --> 01:27:59.844]  But if you wear a Molon Lobby shirt, or a Don't California My Texas shirt, or Don't Venezuela My USA shirt, we've got that shirt coming in, or you get a woman's Molon Lobby, you're just going to meet other patriots.
[01:28:00.785 --> 01:28:02.206]  And still spread the word about
[01:28:04.312 --> 01:28:05.894]  Basic maxims of freedom.
[01:28:06.955 --> 01:28:08.196]  Get a t-shirt today.
[01:28:08.236 --> 01:28:10.558]  We've got a wide spectrum of shirts.
[01:28:10.578 --> 01:28:12.160]  Some of the best shirts we've ever had.
[01:28:13.991 --> 01:28:19.954]  And InfoWarsTore.com, and that's one of our biggest outreaches too, are these InfoWars.com shirts.
[01:28:20.655 --> 01:28:29.060]  We're also going to come out with a NewsWars.com shirt, where again, if you don't want to get in a blue area and get stabbed or shot, just wear a NewsWars.com.
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:34.323]  The average Libtar doesn't know what that is, but you still spread the word about the website, and you still meet like-minded people.
[01:28:35.163 --> 01:28:36.303]  And we've got some other great shirts.
[01:28:36.343 --> 01:28:37.884]  We've got the Tiananmen Square shirt.
[01:28:37.944 --> 01:28:38.784]  It's one of my favorites.
[01:28:39.384 --> 01:28:42.125]  It shows the tanks of big tech rolling up against free speech.
[01:28:42.305 --> 01:28:44.966]  We've got the George Washington shirt.
[01:28:45.026 --> 01:28:46.407]  We've got so many great shirts.
[01:28:46.447 --> 01:28:46.967]  Ball caps.
[01:28:47.407 --> 01:28:51.389]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.

[01:28:57.110 --> 01:29:01.492]  Get the highest quality toothpaste, the best coffee, the best protein bars.
[01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:07.806]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[01:30:04.177 --> 01:30:07.339]  Family was watched through Nest security cameras.
[01:30:07.499 --> 01:30:11.722]  And they hear this man's voice, they feel crazy, they hear it again, then they capture it.
[01:30:11.742 --> 01:30:13.983]  And then the guy's jacking with everything in the house.
[01:30:14.184 --> 01:30:18.546]  Trying to kill the baby with 90 degree turned up heat, or turning the power off, or messing with everything.
[01:30:18.666 --> 01:30:20.167]  This is what you brought into your house.
[01:30:20.307 --> 01:30:22.549]  Why would you want ubiquitous systems like this?
[01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:25.851]  Well, because, you know, I can then watch my house remotely.
[01:30:25.911 --> 01:30:26.771]  What are you gonna do all day?
[01:30:26.892 --> 01:30:27.532]  Oh, he got an alert.
[01:30:27.712 --> 01:30:29.593]  Oh, a deer walked by, or a stray dog.
[01:30:29.653 --> 01:30:30.354]  He's been your whole life.
[01:30:30.874 --> 01:30:32.116]  Watching and watching and watching.
[01:30:32.296 --> 01:30:35.820]  Don't have guns, but, oh, have lots of cameras, lots of cameras, which don't actually cut crime.
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:40.906]  I'm not saying cameras in and of themselves are bad, but these are two-way digital cameras that anybody can jump on.
[01:30:41.026 --> 01:30:42.888]  Like, whatever the biggest system is, always the worst.
[01:30:42.988 --> 01:30:45.030]  It's like, oh, I've got the biggest, I've got the best.
[01:30:45.291 --> 01:30:48.735]  You need a big, giant, red X on your ass.
[01:30:49.375 --> 01:30:59.885]  As I approached the baby's room and stood outside, I was shocked to hear a deep manly voice talking to my seven-month-year-old son.
[01:31:00.026 --> 01:31:00.986]  My blood ran cold.
[01:31:01.227 --> 01:31:05.391]  Arjun Sood was standing outside his son Oliver's door Sunday when he heard that voice.
[01:31:05.711 --> 01:31:06.412]  He burst in.
[01:31:06.672 --> 01:31:07.573]  The voice stopped.
[01:31:07.873 --> 01:31:09.174]  See, this is all tentacles for them.
[01:31:09.434 --> 01:31:10.154]  That's what you're going to see.
[01:31:10.254 --> 01:31:16.477]  All the devices are going to be used for all these demonically possessed people to then interface with them, and then the real hell's going to begin.
[01:31:16.917 --> 01:31:22.479]  All their tentacles, all their weapons, all their surveillance is being put in, and then all you're going to see is demonic manifestation.
[01:31:22.559 --> 01:31:23.580]  Demonic manifestation.
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:24.600]  This is the invasion.
[01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:25.520]  This is the invasion.
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:28.482]  He and his wife chalked it up to baby monitor interference.
[01:31:28.722 --> 01:31:31.463]  But once downstairs... Oh man, I was standing right about here.
[01:31:31.603 --> 01:31:32.623]  They heard the voice again.
[01:31:32.723 --> 01:31:33.204]  Who is this?
[01:31:34.404 --> 01:31:40.007]  An unseen intruder talking to them through their Nest security camera using obscenities.
[01:31:40.287 --> 01:31:48.252]  Asking me, you know, why I'm looking at him because he saw obviously that I was looking back and continuing to taunt me.
[01:31:48.452 --> 01:31:49.232]  It was terrifying.
[01:31:49.312 --> 01:31:55.276]  Sud says once his shocks subsided, he composed himself enough to record part of the ominous exchange.
[01:31:55.456 --> 01:31:56.416]  What's that?
[01:31:59.562 --> 01:32:05.265]  Sude believes the hacker also turned their upstairs thermostat to 90 degrees, noticing that the same night.
[01:32:07.046 --> 01:32:08.866]  A potential danger to their baby.
[01:32:08.946 --> 01:32:10.387]  And then they mess with our thermostat?
[01:32:10.827 --> 01:32:11.027]  Why?
[01:32:11.087 --> 01:32:11.528]  Who does that?
[01:32:11.588 --> 01:32:12.488]  Again, who does that?
[01:32:12.548 --> 01:32:13.429]  Get out of my way.
[01:32:13.449 --> 01:32:15.169]  I'm having a discussion with your child.
[01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:17.150]  How dare you interfere with me?
[01:32:17.570 --> 01:32:19.872]  I'm grooming your baby.
[01:32:20.152 --> 01:32:21.732]  I've been grooming it for a while.
[01:32:21.872 --> 01:32:24.073]  I'm a liberal.
[01:32:25.594 --> 01:32:27.255]  Children, we need to have a nurse.
[01:32:28.524 --> 01:32:33.806]  The suits unplugged their interior cameras, called police, and soon after, Nest itself.
[01:32:34.006 --> 01:32:42.530]  And then they said, well, you should have used a unique password and two-factor authentication, and if you did, you know, that would be that.
[01:32:42.710 --> 01:32:44.451]  But it's your fault, see, you didn't know.
[01:32:44.471 --> 01:32:45.552]  Let me explain something, Bubba.
[01:32:46.112 --> 01:32:48.213]  Amazon's got AI watching your butt.
[01:32:48.273 --> 01:32:52.935]  So you think that low-level demon that got in on there so it could stare at your baby is a problem?
[01:32:52.995 --> 01:32:55.056]  Buddy, that is the least of your problems.
[01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:57.237]  Real devils don't show their tails.
[01:32:57.877 --> 01:33:00.678]  Until they got you hanging up by your toes.
[01:33:06.461 --> 01:33:10.583]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.888 --> 01:33:26.890]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.963 --> 01:33:35.464]  There must be some way out of here, said the joker to the thief.
[01:33:37.405 --> 01:33:42.926]  There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
[01:33:44.847 --> 01:33:50.668]  Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth.
[01:33:52.349 --> 01:33:57.070]  None of them are along the line, nobody of it
[01:34:00.811 --> 01:34:01.952]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:34:03.553 --> 01:34:04.193]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:34:04.233 --> 01:34:05.874]  We're at the Midway Point, the broadcast today.
[01:34:07.355 --> 01:34:17.140]  I want to illustrate, before you go to your phone calls, just how insane all the globalist divide-and-conquer race-baiting is.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:26.825]  When it's all of our children being hit by genetically modified crops and food that on record are causing mutations and cancer, it's all of our children
[01:34:27.756 --> 01:34:28.436]  We're good to go.
[01:34:52.079 --> 01:34:56.942]  destruction on the doomsday clock than we've ever been since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1961.
[01:34:57.182 --> 01:35:01.024]  This is out of Reuters.
[01:35:02.225 --> 01:35:06.607]  After Putin's warning, Russian TV lists nuclear targets in the U.S.
[01:35:09.909 --> 01:35:20.135]  So while our government's been funding the Arab Spring, and Trump tried to stop that, Maduro's running around blowing up and burning down food trucks,
[01:35:23.584 --> 01:35:25.405]  Russian state television has listed U.S.
[01:35:25.425 --> 01:35:33.827]  military facilities that Moscow would target in the event of a nuclear strike, and said that hypersonic missile Russia's developing would be able to hit them in less than five minutes.
[01:35:38.948 --> 01:35:41.749]  And in the media, as always, Russia's got faster missiles than us.
[01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:43.890]  And that's so the Pentagon gets more funding.
[01:35:44.010 --> 01:35:44.570]  Yeah, right.
[01:35:46.571 --> 01:35:47.731]  But let's just put it to you this way.
[01:35:48.571 --> 01:35:50.172]  Nobody wins in this.
[01:35:50.512 --> 01:35:51.772]  We'll all destroy the planet.
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:54.320]  The U.S.
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:55.701]  has the most advanced weapons.
[01:35:57.281 --> 01:36:02.343]  But we should not have given even the 1970s technology we've got to the CHICOMs.
[01:36:02.803 --> 01:36:04.023]  That's really stupid.
[01:36:06.244 --> 01:36:12.486]  And the Russians have got their own technology that is extremely deadly, and we're not going to be able to stop hardly any of it.
[01:36:13.886 --> 01:36:16.467]  Not the sea-launched cruise missiles, especially.
[01:36:18.287 --> 01:36:23.389]  You know, half our population lives on the eastern seaboard, and the western seaboard, more than half,
[01:36:24.892 --> 01:36:26.793]  There are submarines 12 miles off the shore.
[01:36:28.435 --> 01:36:29.996]  Nothing's gonna stop the cruise missiles.
[01:36:31.357 --> 01:36:40.924]  All those cities, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, particularly, will be vaporized.
[01:36:43.186 --> 01:36:43.947]  Vaporized.
[01:36:43.967 --> 01:36:49.991]  Why don't you pull up Terminator Judgment Day, that shows Los Angeles being nuked.
[01:36:50.032 --> 01:36:50.952]  That's pretty accurate.
[01:36:51.753 --> 01:36:52.814]  See if you can find that on YouTube.
[01:36:53.908 --> 01:37:00.249]  Terminator 2 Judgment Day nuke scene for TV viewers.
[01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:03.810]  And Hillary wanted all these wars.
[01:37:05.231 --> 01:37:06.471]  And Trump's are trying to get us out of it.
[01:37:10.172 --> 01:37:16.393]  But crisis with Russia is escalating because Trump has allowed the neocons to push troops onto the borders with Russia.
[01:37:18.114 --> 01:37:19.854]  And so Russia's like, well, we'll put troops in your backyard.
[01:37:21.325 --> 01:37:22.926]  Troops in Cuba?
[01:37:23.487 --> 01:37:24.407]  Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:37:25.548 --> 01:37:26.469]  Troops in Venezuela?
[01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:28.771]  The Venezuela Missile Crisis.
[01:37:31.433 --> 01:37:36.116]  See, they don't need to put tube-launched missile launchers in Cuba now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:36.817 --> 01:37:39.339]  They've got sea-launched cruise missiles.
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:44.643]  The equivalent of Trident intermediate-range missiles.
[01:37:47.551 --> 01:37:51.213]  But the thing about a cruise missile is it flies below the radar.
[01:37:54.115 --> 01:37:55.576]  And you're not going to stop it.
[01:37:58.217 --> 01:38:01.760]  Especially if you fire, say, five of them off a sub at L.A.
[01:38:03.561 --> 01:38:05.342]  One about a minute out from the last.
[01:38:06.002 --> 01:38:12.026]  And sure, they start shooting missiles, they start shooting, you know, high-powered projectile weapons at it.
[01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:18.053]  All they do is detonate one to scramble all the electronics so the other cruise missiles come in right behind it.
[01:38:18.273 --> 01:38:19.053]  And that's the doctrine.
[01:38:19.073 --> 01:38:25.818]  By the way, if you're ever sitting at the beach and you see a nuke go off a couple miles out, you better believe more nukes are coming right behind that one.
[01:38:26.378 --> 01:38:30.160]  That's a tactic you use, is you detonate nukes ahead as you come in.
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:31.061]  Nothing's gonna stop that.
[01:38:32.242 --> 01:38:32.962]  Scrambles everything.
[01:38:35.704 --> 01:38:37.545]  So if you're ever like, oh look, looks like a missile!
[01:38:37.585 --> 01:38:40.106]  You see that missile shot out of the air, you're like, oh we stopped it!
[01:38:40.647 --> 01:38:42.508]  Four or five more are coming that same direction.
[01:38:54.150 --> 01:39:00.032]  So AOC says if we don't pay Al Gore and Lord Rothschild everything we do, carbon taxes, we're all going to hell.
[01:39:00.392 --> 01:39:00.832]  But you know what?
[01:39:00.872 --> 01:39:06.073]  We could see the end of the world if this brinksmanship with Russia just continues when Russia's not even our enemy.
[01:39:06.313 --> 01:39:08.454]  The Chai Koms are the ones encircling us.
[01:39:09.014 --> 01:39:11.255]  The Chai Koms are the ones pushing us all around.
[01:39:13.255 --> 01:39:19.297]  But because we're pushing Russia even stronger than China now, Russia is going into a militaristic posture.
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:31.223]  Because Russia's been invaded and attacked many times and knows that lying down only encourages an aggressor.
[01:39:32.263 --> 01:39:34.184]  So, you know, Trump thinks he's going to make his deal on the peninsula.
[01:39:34.204 --> 01:39:34.584]  That's great.
[01:39:34.964 --> 01:39:35.945]  How about we make the deal with Russia?
[01:39:35.985 --> 01:39:37.165]  You see, the neocons were smart.
[01:39:37.645 --> 01:39:38.966]  They're the ones that were running the Democrats.
[01:39:39.526 --> 01:39:46.609]  They always called Trump a Russian agent, knowing that if he ever made a deal with Russia, that would end their world government system.
[01:39:51.092 --> 01:40:00.483]  And so that's why they've strategically positioned themselves that way in the media to always say if Trump even meets with Putin, he's a bad guy.
[01:40:02.245 --> 01:40:04.427]  And they're just maneuvering us towards destruction.
[01:40:05.649 --> 01:40:06.149]  They're crazy.
[01:40:08.072 --> 01:40:10.374]  Now, let's go ahead and play a clip.
[01:40:11.218 --> 01:40:11.799]  Of Spike Lee.
[01:40:11.819 --> 01:40:14.240]  Because, you know, nuclear war or the Russia, it doesn't matter.
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:18.884]  You know, everything's just America and the left trying to stir black people up against white people.
[01:40:19.724 --> 01:40:26.930]  And the reason the left's panicking is numbers show more than double the number of blacks support Republicans now because they're figuring out the scam.
[01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:33.494]  So Spike Lee, who can't even seem to read off his piece of paper, dressed up in his stupid pimp outfit.
[01:40:35.376 --> 01:40:36.717]  I mean, what a joke.
[01:40:37.477 --> 01:40:38.999]  I mean, what a joke.
[01:40:40.148 --> 01:40:50.713]  Worth hundreds of millions of dollars, tool of Hollywood to create racial division, and he's up there talking about how, for his KKK movie, and we gotta get Trump out of office, here it is.
[01:40:57.477 --> 01:40:57.897]  All right.
[01:41:02.779 --> 01:41:05.741]  Sometimes our computers have a little bit of a hiccup.
[01:41:05.761 --> 01:41:08.282]  Let's just stop it right there, it's okay, let's stop it, stop it.
[01:41:08.842 --> 01:41:09.843]  Nope, nope, nope, nope, stop it.
[01:41:12.802 --> 01:41:14.244]  We're gonna start it over at the beginning.
[01:41:14.664 --> 01:41:15.686]  Computers have hiccups.
[01:41:15.806 --> 01:41:16.507]  It's not a big deal.
[01:41:16.527 --> 01:41:19.490]  But once they start train wrecking, we're gonna stop it.
[01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:20.691]  It's just gonna happen.
[01:41:21.132 --> 01:41:21.712]  The way it is.
[01:41:22.753 --> 01:41:24.656]  Let's go ahead and start it over now.
[01:41:24.676 --> 01:41:25.256]  Here's Spike Lee.
[01:41:27.178 --> 01:41:27.579]  All right.
[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:35.940]  No, we're not playing it.
[01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:36.440]  I'm done.
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:37.201]  Terminate!
[01:41:37.301 --> 01:41:37.721]  Terminate!
[01:41:37.981 --> 01:41:38.401]  Terminate!
[01:41:38.661 --> 01:41:39.101]  Terminate!
[01:41:39.341 --> 01:41:39.761]  Terminate!
[01:41:40.001 --> 01:41:40.422]  Terminate!
[01:41:40.662 --> 01:41:41.062]  Terminate!
[01:41:41.142 --> 01:41:41.662]  I'm not mad.
[01:41:42.262 --> 01:41:43.102]  It's a corrupted clip.
[01:41:43.162 --> 01:41:44.743]  Now understand, we're not playing that clip.
[01:41:46.243 --> 01:41:46.683]  I understand.
[01:41:46.863 --> 01:41:49.104]  Oh, they dumped it live because he was cussing too.
[01:41:49.384 --> 01:41:50.324]  Well, I didn't know that.
[01:41:50.925 --> 01:41:52.365]  I saw the clip at home and it wasn't like that.
[01:41:52.765 --> 01:41:54.166]  So it's not a big deal, guys.
[01:41:54.366 --> 01:41:57.967]  The audience doesn't care that the clip's having a problem or that I don't understand it.
[01:41:58.127 --> 01:41:58.727]  It's not a big deal.
[01:42:01.211 --> 01:42:01.811]  Everything's great.
[01:42:01.831 --> 01:42:03.372]  You have to understand, they're talking to me in the ear, folks.
[01:42:03.432 --> 01:42:04.893]  I'm not just talking to the wall here.
[01:42:05.213 --> 01:42:08.354]  They're talking to me in my ear, and they're not just talking to the wall here.
[01:42:09.234 --> 01:42:09.755]  Everything's good.
[01:42:09.795 --> 01:42:10.675]  We're done talking about Spike Lee.
[01:42:11.875 --> 01:42:13.356]  Everybody knows what Spike Lee said.
[01:42:13.376 --> 01:42:14.777]  Everybody knows what Spike Lee did.
[01:42:15.217 --> 01:42:18.898]  We'll fix this in post when we re-upload it, when we're not live, and we'll get to it later.
[01:42:20.379 --> 01:42:27.742]  My point in getting to that, though, was if you want to see some real racist, and you want to see some really bad stuff, it's the black Israelites
[01:42:28.703 --> 01:42:35.047]  That we're attacking the Covington kids, our reporter talked to them, and they say, yeah, you're a white person, you deserve to die, and God's gonna kill you.
[01:42:35.727 --> 01:42:53.457]  None of that's in the Bible, it's totally insane, but that's what every twisted cult group believes, is that they are the master race, whether it's the black Israelites, or the Nazis, or, you know, there's extremist groups all over the place, but in this climate, more and more minorities are acting like this, because they've been taught it's impossible for them to be racist.
[01:42:54.821 --> 01:42:58.163]  Alright, your phone calls, I promise, are straight ahead when we come back.
[01:42:58.183 --> 01:42:58.824]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:43:15.393 --> 01:43:16.693]  This is the channel they're trying to shut down.
[01:43:17.114 --> 01:43:18.074]  This is what they don't want on there.
[01:43:18.214 --> 01:43:19.494]  This is the wild card.
[01:43:19.654 --> 01:43:23.015]  Time and time again, when nobody else is covering it, we're covering it.
[01:43:23.155 --> 01:43:24.656]  It breaks out, and it defeats them.
[01:43:24.816 --> 01:43:28.317]  So, if you want to defeat the globalists, just keep doing what you've already been doing.
[01:43:28.357 --> 01:43:33.699]  Remember that, yeah, you can get censored or banned on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook for promoting it at fullwars.com links.
[01:43:33.719 --> 01:43:34.339]  We make it easier.
[01:43:34.419 --> 01:43:35.299]  Promote a News Wars link.
[01:43:35.399 --> 01:43:37.840]  That doesn't get you banned 10% as much, but who cares?
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:40.841]  They built these platforms to get us in there like a web.
[01:43:41.661 --> 01:43:47.607]  So the spiders would have us caught and come up and say, do what we say or we'll not let you talk to people.
[01:43:48.648 --> 01:43:50.570]  And you go, okay, and they get you tied around the web.
[01:43:51.411 --> 01:43:53.873]  And then pretty soon it's like, you can't get free now.
[01:43:54.333 --> 01:43:55.775]  Mmm, delicious.
[01:43:56.315 --> 01:44:05.364]  And that's exactly who Jack Dorsey and all these people are, smart ass spiders that all screw each other and lie and just, oh yeah.
[01:44:06.951 --> 01:44:09.555]  We've got a Bitcoin pump and dump.
[01:44:09.675 --> 01:44:13.902]  I dumped my stock before it plunged, and now I'm gonna sucker you back in.
[01:44:20.565 --> 01:44:21.866]  That's how the spider operates.
[01:44:21.986 --> 01:44:23.668]  We gotta learn to recognize the spider.
[01:44:23.788 --> 01:44:25.049]  It's in love with itself.
[01:44:25.349 --> 01:44:26.670]  It's fallen.
[01:44:26.891 --> 01:44:30.134]  And it's so sure of itself and how it can destroy everything around it.
[01:44:30.194 --> 01:44:31.815]  But we're here to say no.
[01:44:32.035 --> 01:44:40.664]  InfoWars has been chosen out of the spectrum of resistance because it's one of the leading lights.
[01:44:42.247 --> 01:44:43.708]  The spiders don't like light.
[01:44:43.968 --> 01:44:44.529]  They like dark.
[01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:48.311]  And so, if they're able, they believe, to shut us down.
[01:44:48.491 --> 01:44:52.554]  They believe they've killed a major nexus point for human expression and human freedom.
[01:44:52.954 --> 01:44:54.975]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:44:55.516 --> 01:44:56.396]  I can tell you this.
[01:44:56.597 --> 01:44:58.838]  The fact that we're persecuted shows we're over the target.
[01:44:59.018 --> 01:45:08.565]  And we just have to hold on a few more years into the future for things we're going to do that don't just give us the big victories that you've already delivered by supporting us.
[01:45:08.665 --> 01:45:09.385]  We're all in this together.
[01:45:09.465 --> 01:45:12.087]  But to even bigger victories that make
[01:45:12.607 --> 01:45:14.749]  Once you're mad, he's got to go through a lot easier.
[01:45:14.849 --> 01:45:16.570]  And I realize that's the commitment.
[01:45:16.630 --> 01:45:23.715]  If I'm willing to go all the way, and if you're willing to go all the way, there's going to be major dividends for our children and for society and culture.
[01:45:23.835 --> 01:45:29.519]  Where, you know, only a billion people are going to die in this Armageddon instead of like seven billion.
[01:45:30.139 --> 01:45:32.401]  I mean, seriously, like, it's kind of choose your adventure.
[01:45:33.181 --> 01:45:40.887]  If we really get involved now and say no to all this up front, then we're going to go through this metamorphosis and it's going to be rough, but it'll be okay.
[01:45:41.687 --> 01:45:46.730]  If we don't, I tell you, it's a very, very hard road we're going down.
[01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:51.692]  And so, I would just ask everybody to really search their heart and soul and commit to this fight.
[01:45:51.752 --> 01:45:52.993]  Thank you all for your financial support.
[01:45:53.253 --> 01:45:54.213]  That's beyond critical.
[01:45:54.614 --> 01:45:59.036]  And forward to where I come.
[01:46:04.599 --> 01:46:11.182]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:15.912]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:46:16.032 --> 01:46:18.053]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:46:18.694 --> 01:46:22.516]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:46:22.997 --> 01:46:30.381]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[01:46:30.481 --> 01:46:32.903]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[01:46:36.343 --> 01:46:38.524]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:46:38.564 --> 01:46:39.264]  They called it U.N.
[01:46:39.424 --> 01:46:40.764]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[01:46:40.784 --> 01:46:41.724]  2030 Agenda.
[01:46:41.984 --> 01:46:52.727]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[01:46:55.168 --> 01:46:57.928]  Never missed your show, any day.
[01:46:57.988 --> 01:47:00.109]  I mean, what?
[01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.969]  I mean, never!
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:12.005]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:27.856 --> 01:47:32.800]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:39.432 --> 01:47:43.355]  All right, I'm gonna go bam, bam, bam, bam through your calls, okay?
[01:47:43.395 --> 01:47:47.517]  And we'll go right into the next hour as well with special guests joining us in studio and out.
[01:47:48.198 --> 01:47:51.080]  Robert Barnes will be in studio and of course Joe Bannister, they both know each other.
[01:47:52.461 --> 01:47:54.882]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls right now.
[01:47:55.583 --> 01:47:58.905]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:47:58.945 --> 01:48:01.807]  Let's talk to Pastor Sam in Texas.
[01:48:01.867 --> 01:48:05.349]  Pastor Sam, what do you think we should do about Venezuela?
[01:48:07.742 --> 01:48:08.523]  Oh my goodness.
[01:48:09.044 --> 01:48:10.906]  It's cracking open.
[01:48:11.646 --> 01:48:18.234]  First, I'd like to say that all of your analysis that you just shot from the hip on is 100% correct.
[01:48:18.895 --> 01:48:21.537]  I have a lot more information to support those points.
[01:48:22.699 --> 01:48:25.802]  One thing, for example, we don't need the UN at all.
[01:48:26.303 --> 01:48:28.225]  The Organization of American States
[01:48:28.681 --> 01:48:40.468]  It's already set up to go in with our Latin American allies, to include Canada, to go in and manage the reconstruction or the transition, the establishment of free election.
[01:48:41.029 --> 01:48:43.350]  So the UN can just be cut out completely.
[01:48:43.690 --> 01:48:47.412]  That's part of the reason that the globalists are so angry about this.
[01:48:48.533 --> 01:48:50.794]  They're still trying to make their inroads.
[01:48:51.275 --> 01:48:56.598]  They're still trying to go in first with vaccinations and first with a coalition of churches.
[01:48:57.058 --> 01:48:58.159]  I'm really not for that.
[01:48:59.096 --> 01:49:08.721]  That was what was wrong with Joplin, Missouri, if anybody wonders why the hand of God came in and destroyed that, because all the churches were united, and the Roman ones were running it.
[01:49:09.142 --> 01:49:16.486]  You're absolutely correct in all of your points, everything that you laid out, including your mistrust of Marco Rubio.
[01:49:16.846 --> 01:49:18.127]  I don't like Marco Rubio.
[01:49:18.387 --> 01:49:22.990]  I don't like his de facto position as the answer man for Latin America.
[01:49:23.410 --> 01:49:27.172]  It's just a good thing that we fought hard for Cruz, because otherwise,
[01:49:27.802 --> 01:49:38.507]  Marco Rubio and Beto O'Rourke would be down tiptoeing through the tulips together and making sure that whatever happens in there is a globalist government.
[01:49:38.648 --> 01:49:39.668]  Sure, I don't want the U.N.
[01:49:39.708 --> 01:49:47.052]  in Venezuela, but if the U.N., if Trump gets involved with the U.N., then that'll make Russia and China stand down because it'll be done at the U.N.
[01:49:47.072 --> 01:49:48.412]  I don't like the U.N.
[01:49:48.433 --> 01:49:49.213]  I can't stand the U.N.
[01:49:49.313 --> 01:49:51.954]  And you're right, the Organization of American States would be a great way to do it.
[01:49:52.254 --> 01:49:54.756]  All I know is it's already a failed state.
[01:49:55.396 --> 01:49:56.777]  Venezuela is already a failed state.
[01:49:56.817 --> 01:49:59.719]  It's collapsing into Central America now.
[01:50:00.179 --> 01:50:01.580]  It's destabilizing the whole area.
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:03.601]  Actually, I don't know how the U.S.
[01:50:03.661 --> 01:50:04.402]  doesn't act.
[01:50:04.842 --> 01:50:06.343]  It is in our sphere of influence.
[01:50:06.643 --> 01:50:11.026]  And I don't know how Maduro would torch all those trucks and then take credit.
[01:50:11.046 --> 01:50:14.788]  I thought, that's got to be a false flag by Colombia because it makes Maduro look so bad.
[01:50:14.828 --> 01:50:23.554]  No, Maduro is so disconnected from reality, he doesn't know how crazy he looks in those military training videos where the military is looking at him like he's a moron.
[01:50:23.834 --> 01:50:25.836]  I mean Maduro literally I think has like a 70 IQ.
[01:50:43.601 --> 01:50:48.585]  There was a constitutional provision for him to take power in the event of an absence or of fraud.
[01:50:49.085 --> 01:50:49.506]  No, no, no.
[01:50:49.606 --> 01:50:55.310]  I know he got in after being the minion of Chavez, but since then the elections have been fraudulent.
[01:50:55.691 --> 01:50:58.473]  They've gone in, they've changed the rules in the legislature.
[01:50:58.513 --> 01:50:59.373]  I appreciate your call.
[01:51:00.134 --> 01:51:02.156]  Most evidence points towards him being a dictator.
[01:51:02.216 --> 01:51:03.937]  Hell, he's machine-gunning people on the streets now.
[01:51:04.457 --> 01:51:05.839]  All I know is the place is collapsing.
[01:51:06.539 --> 01:51:07.200]  Who's up next?
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:08.841]  Let's talk to Alex in Michigan.
[01:51:08.901 --> 01:51:09.702]  Alex, thanks for calling.
[01:51:09.722 --> 01:51:10.022]  Go ahead.
[01:51:12.242 --> 01:51:12.844]  Alex Jones.
[01:51:13.044 --> 01:51:14.227]  It's good to talk to you again.
[01:51:14.247 --> 01:51:15.289]  Good to talk to you, Alex.
[01:51:16.632 --> 01:51:18.517]  I just wanted to plug the fish oil.
[01:51:18.858 --> 01:51:20.602]  The fish oil has iodine in it.
[01:51:20.662 --> 01:51:21.403]  I don't know if you knew that.
[01:51:23.067 --> 01:51:27.730]  I know that we go out to the top firms in the country and say, what is the highest rated, cleanest, best fish oil?
[01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:29.671]  And then we private label it and sell it for less.
[01:51:29.711 --> 01:51:34.674]  So a lot of our products, half our products or more, are private labeled, top brands.
[01:51:35.514 --> 01:51:40.457]  That way we already get the top testing, already, you know, loved by a bunch of people.
[01:51:40.837 --> 01:51:43.138]  And so, yes, all three of our fish oils are top of the line.
[01:51:44.539 --> 01:51:45.460]  Yeah, they're great products.
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:46.860]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:51:47.101 --> 01:51:47.561]  Thank you, brother.
[01:51:49.062 --> 01:51:56.627]  You know, Venezuela, it's kind of a pickle here, because, you know, I don't trust Bolton or the deep state false flaggers.
[01:51:56.647 --> 01:51:58.969]  It's like the boy who cried wolf.
[01:51:59.029 --> 01:52:00.250]  Like, how can you trust these guys?
[01:52:00.290 --> 01:52:05.113]  But at the same time, Venezuela is a hellhole.
[01:52:05.813 --> 01:52:08.335]  And I think we should invade Mexico, too.
[01:52:08.395 --> 01:52:09.556]  Mexico's a failed state.
[01:52:10.196 --> 01:52:16.921]  We should, you know, if we didn't have all these deep state traders running things, we could really liberate these people.
[01:52:19.524 --> 01:52:21.485]  It's kind of a shame, you know?
[01:52:21.505 --> 01:52:23.806]  You can't trust these people to actually do the job.
[01:52:26.808 --> 01:52:28.069]  That's where I'm coming from.
[01:52:28.469 --> 01:52:29.530]  We can't even pull out of Syria.
[01:52:31.417 --> 01:52:36.139]  Exactly, and if we cherry-picked people out of Latin America or anywhere else, they'd be great for our country.
[01:52:36.659 --> 01:52:38.759]  Instead, the UN sets up these refugee bases.
[01:52:38.799 --> 01:52:45.721]  They indoctrinate, you know, the most poor, unskilled people to come here expecting a free lunch and to be socialists.
[01:52:46.102 --> 01:52:47.442]  That's a recipe for disaster.
[01:52:47.462 --> 01:52:49.443]  It's a total recipe for disaster.
[01:52:49.463 --> 01:52:49.943]  God bless you.
[01:52:49.963 --> 01:52:50.563]  Appreciate the call.
[01:52:51.183 --> 01:52:53.764]  We're going to Carlos and Josh and a bunch of others here.
[01:52:55.188 --> 01:52:57.189]  Let's go ahead, though, and take a call on North Korea.
[01:52:57.210 --> 01:52:59.251]  Let's talk to Peter in Chicago.
[01:52:59.271 --> 01:53:02.693]  He wants to compare North Korea to Venezuela.
[01:53:05.956 --> 01:53:06.696]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[01:53:06.736 --> 01:53:08.678]  It's an honor to be able to speak on your show.
[01:53:08.698 --> 01:53:09.859]  Honor to talk to you, sir.
[01:53:09.899 --> 01:53:10.239]  Thank you.
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:19.766]  I would first like to say that I've lived in both South Korea and in northern China, and that is where I'm facing my observations from.
[01:53:20.887 --> 01:53:21.047]  Wow.
[01:53:21.087 --> 01:53:23.709]  Inasmuch, yeah, it wasn't fun.
[01:53:25.151 --> 01:53:29.913]  I was making money, good enough, doing help over there.
[01:53:29.953 --> 01:53:48.079]  But when I visited both Dandong, which is on the border between China and North Korea, and I've seen the DMZ down in South Korea, what Donald Trump is doing in order to foster through capitalism a method of bridging peace between North and South Korea is amazing, first and foremost.
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:52.641]  However, to compare this to how his political policies with Venezuela
[01:53:53.738 --> 01:53:55.819]  It's going to have to look at it from a cultural standpoint.
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:54:03.244]  The main reason why North Korea and South Korea are better off to do peace is because they have a shared culture that goes back thousands of years, a shared language.
[01:54:03.965 --> 01:54:11.089]  And in that regard, it incentivizes North Korea to just kind of see, look at what America has done for South Korea.
[01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:14.532]  You know what I mean?
[01:54:14.552 --> 01:54:15.132]  No, I agree.
[01:54:15.152 --> 01:54:20.275]  I mean, even even liberal publications like the Huffington Post say we've got to have regime change in Venezuela.
[01:54:20.616 --> 01:54:22.377]  They're saying it can become the next North Korea.
[01:54:23.504 --> 01:54:23.784]  Right.
[01:54:24.224 --> 01:54:37.769]  And also, because of its area, its actual strategic area, it is similar to how Cuba could be used as a staging ground for potential warfare, if you think about it.
[01:54:38.049 --> 01:54:39.589]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:54:39.649 --> 01:54:44.531]  I mean, it's right there in northeast South America, surrounded by four countries.
[01:54:44.611 --> 01:54:45.531]  It's very strategic.
[01:54:45.952 --> 01:54:47.492]  And it's very, very rich in oil.
[01:54:47.912 --> 01:54:49.853]  I mean, Venezuela's got more oil than Texas.
[01:54:50.931 --> 01:54:51.452]  Exactly.
[01:54:51.752 --> 01:54:55.855]  And if you think about it like this, it's not just Russia that's going to be interested in getting a foothold there.
[01:54:55.875 --> 01:54:56.576]  It's going to be China.
[01:54:57.056 --> 01:55:02.800]  China's already interested in a huge foothold in South America because of all the blast oil reserves off the coast of Argentina.
[01:55:03.081 --> 01:55:08.705]  You know, I forgot to add, you know, China is testing its social credit surveillance score, oh, in Venezuela.
[01:55:09.526 --> 01:55:17.172]  I've been following you in China before you got deplatformed there, before you got a part of the ad block with Facebook and everything eight, ten years ago.
[01:55:17.352 --> 01:55:17.552]  Wow.
[01:55:17.892 --> 01:55:19.754]  I mean, I found you out back then.
[01:55:20.336 --> 01:55:23.959]  And I love what you had to expose with Prison Planet and with Infowars.
[01:55:24.439 --> 01:55:37.549]  And I want to let you know that some of the information that they're blocking there and they're testing out there with the facial recognition software, the social credit scores, we have something similar, but it's through the corporate crony system of the capitalist tech companies, obviously.
[01:55:38.590 --> 01:55:39.351]  With that being said,
[01:55:40.211 --> 01:55:46.256]  Going back to the difference between North Korea and Venezuela is that, remember, North Korea is a dictatorship.
[01:55:46.696 --> 01:55:49.759]  And the thing is that Kim Jong-un is like Ocasio-Dede.
[01:55:49.819 --> 01:55:50.339]  He's like 35.
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:54.243]  And the thing is that he knows he can get overthrown and end up like Gaddafi.
[01:55:55.003 --> 01:56:00.688]  And the thing is that he understands that once he visited South Korea, he saw the high speed internet better than in America.
[01:56:01.474 --> 01:56:01.874]  We're good to go.
[01:56:27.546 --> 01:56:28.406]  Oh, exactly.
[01:56:28.447 --> 01:56:30.548]  And people don't know about the cultures.
[01:56:31.148 --> 01:56:32.629]  China's in all these wars with Japan.
[01:56:33.029 --> 01:56:35.650]  Japan's in all these wars with China and the Koreans.
[01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:39.572]  And the Chinese, historically, really have had big wars with the Koreans.
[01:56:40.033 --> 01:56:46.236]  And China has helped keep communism in charge and to make sure that there's no development in North Korea.
[01:56:46.276 --> 01:56:50.858]  The best move would be North Korea to merge with South Korea and to make a deal with the United States.
[01:56:50.898 --> 01:56:54.060]  But again, Kim Jong-un, as you said very astutely, because you've lived there,
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:57.883]  Trump knows the minute he really tries that, the Chinese will kill his ass.
[01:56:58.223 --> 01:57:00.225]  So Trump is putting pressure on the Chinese.
[01:57:00.305 --> 01:57:00.986]  Don't do that.
[01:57:02.387 --> 01:57:06.571]  And we're going to put major pressure on you if you don't let us do this with North Korea.
[01:57:06.771 --> 01:57:10.635]  That's why what Trump is doing is very sophisticated, but also very hard.
[01:57:10.695 --> 01:57:11.876]  I mean, Trump is bold.
[01:57:13.078 --> 01:57:13.898]  It is a bold move.
[01:57:13.958 --> 01:57:15.079]  I think it's a beautiful move.
[01:57:15.119 --> 01:57:15.819]  It's a bold move.
[01:57:16.259 --> 01:57:21.201]  And the thing is that the difference between how Venezuela is being helped with, you got to look at it from a cultural standpoint.
[01:57:21.462 --> 01:57:28.264]  Colombia, the surrounding areas around it, like Brazil, these countries have a shared Latin American culture with Venezuela.
[01:57:28.584 --> 01:57:34.447]  And I feel that it's probably going to be more interested, even though that Brazil is a part of the BRIC of Russia, India, and China.
[01:57:35.077 --> 01:57:37.539]  The fact is that they just now allowed guns in Brazil.
[01:57:37.979 --> 01:57:41.221]  You know, for the average person, the populist government there is taking foothold.
[01:57:41.602 --> 01:57:48.967]  I guarantee you, there's going to be significant arms trafficking that America's not going to need to do in order for the revolution to be able to take foothold there.
[01:57:48.987 --> 01:57:50.908]  Alright, hey, Peter, smart guy.
[01:57:51.008 --> 01:57:52.369]  Thanks for giving us all your information.

[01:59:55.003 --> 01:59:59.106]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.627 --> 02:00:00.968]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:04.831 --> 02:00:15.219]  Tense meeting with Guaido in Colombia right now.
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:16.440]  The U.S.
[02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:18.022]  is recognizing Ash.
[02:00:19.930 --> 02:00:26.354]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.055 --> 02:00:30.116]  You better believe that the U.S.
[02:00:30.136 --> 02:00:35.879]  is about to move militarily against Venezuela.
[02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:39.982]  The tea leaves are very, very clear.
[02:00:42.123 --> 02:00:43.144]  And the sky is gray.
[02:00:45.092 --> 02:00:49.735]  And the Russians and the Iranians moving in there is going to elicit military attacks.
[02:00:50.416 --> 02:00:55.339]  You just bet your bottom dollar it's gonna happen next week, next month, maybe tomorrow.
[02:00:56.760 --> 02:00:58.261]  Like, night following day.
[02:01:00.503 --> 02:01:03.905]  And I don't sit there and go, oh yeah, great, get to watch some war on TV.
[02:01:04.565 --> 02:01:05.906]  We shouldn't be in Ukraine.
[02:01:06.146 --> 02:01:07.808]  We shouldn't have overthrown their country.
[02:01:08.088 --> 02:01:13.852]  We shouldn't have moved troops in to battle Russians in areas that are 90% Russian, where Russia was founded.
[02:01:14.892 --> 02:01:17.094]  I'm not a Russophile, I'm a survival file.
[02:01:17.695 --> 02:01:19.757]  And I don't like starting wars with people for no reason.
[02:01:21.439 --> 02:01:23.301]  Now I know Trump inherited all these messes.
[02:01:23.642 --> 02:01:26.605]  And I get that he's trying to do the peace deal right now and it's a beautiful thing.
[02:01:27.786 --> 02:01:28.968]  With what's happened with North Korea.
[02:01:32.113 --> 02:01:36.116]  It's been said that more happens historically sometimes in a year that happens in the next 50.
[02:01:36.777 --> 02:01:41.600]  And we're entering that zone now of everything being compressed and accelerated.
[02:01:42.301 --> 02:01:49.907]  And you can look at the body language of Guadarro and all the rest of it and just bottom line.
[02:01:52.423 --> 02:02:02.611]  Guido and others know that they tried the olive branch with Madero and he was dumb enough to have his military attack those convoys and then admitted he did it?
[02:02:08.135 --> 02:02:10.517]  That is not going to go well for him.
[02:02:12.398 --> 02:02:19.444]  And I guarantee you the US has all its different operatives in there trying to get somebody to kill the Venezuelan
[02:02:21.863 --> 02:02:22.143]  Leader.
[02:02:23.043 --> 02:02:26.204]  So that a big war isn't needed, but regardless, it's all about to happen.
[02:02:27.104 --> 02:02:29.145]  You can just tell the body language, the whole deal.
[02:02:29.225 --> 02:02:31.045]  It's on, in my opinion.
[02:02:31.425 --> 02:02:36.567]  Things may pull back, things may change, but currently, we are about to go to war with Venezuela.
[02:02:36.887 --> 02:02:42.388]  That means with the dictatorship, with the regime that's teetering on the edge of collapse right now.
[02:02:44.352 --> 02:02:45.192]  I want to go to phone calls.
[02:02:45.232 --> 02:02:45.993]  We will the next hour.
[02:02:46.013 --> 02:02:48.254]  We have two guests joining us as well, but I'll get to everybody that's on the board.
[02:02:48.834 --> 02:02:51.455]  Can we turn up audio from this raw satellite feed from Columbia?
[02:02:52.216 --> 02:02:53.016]  Again, bordering Venezuela.
[02:02:53.036 --> 02:02:54.637]  Let's try to turn that up.
[02:02:56.238 --> 02:02:58.319]  Vice President Mike Pence is giving a speech.
[02:02:59.275 --> 02:03:02.779]  Again, most of this is not on US television.
[02:03:27.637 --> 02:03:29.999]  By the way, if your TV viewer
[02:03:56.246 --> 02:03:57.367]  Radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[02:03:57.867 --> 02:03:58.508]  It's U.S.
[02:03:58.728 --> 02:03:58.908]  aid.
[02:03:59.028 --> 02:04:00.909]  That's State Department money to the U.N.
[02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:03.751]  That's what Soros gets the money for that.
[02:04:03.771 --> 02:04:04.612]  He doesn't give his own money.
[02:04:04.912 --> 02:04:09.575]  He gets the money because Hillary put his people in, and then he funds the caravans.
[02:04:10.496 --> 02:04:11.757]  This is Trump using U.S.
[02:04:11.857 --> 02:04:13.058]  aid to actually help Venezuelans.
[02:04:13.738 --> 02:04:15.099]  And of course, so the communists burn it.
[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:16.700]  Stand strong.
[02:04:18.881 --> 02:04:25.146]  With the only legitimate president of Venezuela, President Juan Guaido.
[02:04:25.751 --> 02:04:29.073]  We will continue to support you and stand with you.
[02:04:29.153 --> 02:04:37.959]  But at the same time, we will also remain firm in our support for the only legitimate president of Venezuela, President Juan Guaido.
[02:04:42.372 --> 02:04:43.393]  All right, we're going to get a break.
[02:04:43.413 --> 02:04:44.814]  We've got more of your calls coming up.
[02:04:44.854 --> 02:04:45.454]  Stay with us.
[02:04:45.915 --> 02:04:46.735]  So much to cover.
[02:04:46.876 --> 02:04:58.705]  If you didn't know, basically Russia is openly threatening nuclear war now with the United States over all this, because nuclear weapons have been moved into Ukraine, to the Russian border, and the Polish border.
[02:04:59.025 --> 02:05:00.346]  So the Russians are now escalating.
[02:05:00.466 --> 02:05:04.729]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:04.749 --> 02:05:06.070]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:05:06.130 --> 02:05:07.932]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:05:08.052 --> 02:05:08.452]  It is.
[02:05:08.652 --> 02:05:10.214]  But if you took it with bish oil,
[02:05:11.469 --> 02:05:13.031]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[02:05:13.491 --> 02:05:14.772]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:05:14.852 --> 02:05:16.593]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:05:16.674 --> 02:05:18.995]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[02:05:19.156 --> 02:05:20.697]  Brain, body, heart.
[02:05:20.797 --> 02:05:22.178]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[02:05:22.238 --> 02:05:23.459]  You've got the children's.
[02:05:23.619 --> 02:05:24.620]  You've got the adults.
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:25.641]  You've got the krill oil.
[02:05:25.741 --> 02:05:28.183]  If you're gonna get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's
[02:05:28.203 --> 02:05:29.944]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:05:54.963 --> 02:06:00.776]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:06:00.977 --> 02:06:01.718]  I just can't do it!
[02:06:04.801 --> 02:06:06.001]  In the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[02:06:06.021 --> 02:06:14.125]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[02:06:14.585 --> 02:06:17.046]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[02:06:17.086 --> 02:06:18.566]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[02:06:18.886 --> 02:06:20.787]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[02:06:21.047 --> 02:06:23.168]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[02:06:23.388 --> 02:06:24.468]  This is all confirmed.
[02:06:24.488 --> 02:06:25.429]  This is not a drill.
[02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:29.510]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[02:06:29.870 --> 02:06:31.171]  They've officially become state-run.
[02:06:31.911 --> 02:06:32.492]  Apple 100%.
[02:06:32.712 --> 02:06:37.916]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[02:06:38.356 --> 02:06:43.119]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[02:06:43.419 --> 02:06:44.280]  This is happening.
[02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:52.226]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[02:06:52.326 --> 02:06:58.230]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[02:06:58.650 --> 02:07:06.676]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[02:07:07.357 --> 02:07:11.060]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:14.562]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[02:07:14.863 --> 02:07:21.848]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[02:07:22.108 --> 02:07:24.790]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[02:07:25.111 --> 02:07:28.353]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score,
[02:07:28.373 --> 02:07:35.821]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[02:07:52.632 --> 02:08:01.360]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:06.284]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[02:08:06.665 --> 02:08:11.529]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[02:08:11.849 --> 02:08:19.552]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[02:08:20.072 --> 02:08:26.815]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[02:08:26.935 --> 02:08:32.617]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[02:08:32.857 --> 02:08:37.559]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[02:08:37.579 --> 02:08:39.580]  I have given you the transmission!
[02:08:44.458 --> 02:08:53.704]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:08:53.724 --> 02:08:55.265]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:08:56.506 --> 02:09:00.448]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:09:10.063 --> 02:09:14.394]  Josh and Carlos and Grant and Douglas and Mitchell and Freedom and Griffin.
[02:09:15.745 --> 02:09:17.185]  We're all riding shotgun together.
[02:09:17.266 --> 02:09:18.526]  Owen Benjamin's in the next hour.
[02:09:19.026 --> 02:09:21.927]  We may take a little bit of that time to make sure I get even more calls in.
[02:09:21.947 --> 02:09:25.988]  In fact, we've got a bunch of calls on the board, but I'm up to the phone's backup on any subject you want to discuss.
[02:09:26.429 --> 02:09:30.350]  The Robert Barnes, or Joe Bannister, or myself, or Venezuela, or Trump's trip to North Korea.
[02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:33.411]  It's a free-for-all, as our good friend Ted Nugent would say.
[02:09:33.431 --> 02:09:33.611]  877-789-2539.
[02:09:33.631 --> 02:09:34.771]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:09:35.111 --> 02:09:43.934]  We're going to go to John, and Josh, and Carlos, and Grant, and Douglas, and Mitchell, and Freedom Fighter, and Griffin.
[02:09:43.974 --> 02:09:45.075]  I will at least get to those calls.
[02:09:46.081 --> 02:09:47.022]  How to do this on purpose.
[02:09:47.062 --> 02:09:54.867]  I know you guys know each other from the big legal dream team he had when they were trying to put him in jail for his free speech as a former treasury agent.
[02:09:55.267 --> 02:09:59.230]  And then a San Francisco liberal jury said, no, Joe Bannister is a patriot.
[02:10:00.571 --> 02:10:01.892]  And that's kind of the discussion today.
[02:10:01.932 --> 02:10:08.396]  But you are already going to be here in town on separate issues with what we're doing versus that.
[02:10:08.456 --> 02:10:10.717]  So you're not even so much here to talk about his case.
[02:10:10.758 --> 02:10:11.698]  He's here to talk about his case.
[02:10:11.998 --> 02:10:13.139]  His book just now came out.
[02:10:13.179 --> 02:10:15.281]  It's available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:10:16.862 --> 02:10:28.298]  Investigating the federal income tax, a report to the American people, Joseph R. Bannister, former IRS special agent, meaning he was actually a badge and a gun, and that's a whole other story.
[02:10:29.767 --> 02:10:30.567]  Interviewing Joe.
[02:10:30.587 --> 02:10:33.748]  Gosh, it's gotta be, it feels like 20 years ago.
[02:10:33.968 --> 02:10:37.669]  He remembers all the dates as a smart CPA and former federal agent.
[02:10:38.529 --> 02:10:42.950]  But you look at all the things he went through in trying to take his CPA license, trying to put him in prison.
[02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:44.491]  It's just been incredible.
[02:10:44.511 --> 02:10:48.832]  And then contemporarily, Lois Lerner getting away with all the persecution.
[02:10:48.872 --> 02:10:53.213]  I mean, back when people talk about IRS persecution 20 years ago, when Joe was, and you were,
[02:10:54.158 --> 02:10:56.302]  From the outside to the inside, it was like, oh, is that really happening?
[02:10:56.322 --> 02:11:00.990]  Now, it's just, oh yeah, we targeted tens of thousands of conservatives and Christian groups and...
[02:11:02.153 --> 02:11:03.553]  MSNBC says they deserve it.
[02:11:03.573 --> 02:11:04.314]  They're racist.
[02:11:04.814 --> 02:11:06.734]  You know, Trump's a KKK member.
[02:11:07.154 --> 02:11:09.395]  Michael Cohen, he's not getting in trouble for any Russiagate.
[02:11:09.435 --> 02:11:11.336]  It's for supposedly not paying taxes.
[02:11:11.376 --> 02:11:12.196]  He's pled guilty to that.
[02:11:12.236 --> 02:11:17.337]  So good to have you here with us in studio, Robert Barnes.
[02:11:17.397 --> 02:11:20.718]  And of course, good to have Joe Bannister here with us as well.
[02:11:21.018 --> 02:11:26.160]  So Joe, Agent4TruthJB.Webley.com.
[02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:28.420]  We'll just link to it up on Infowars.com.
[02:11:28.681 --> 02:11:29.541]  Good to have you here with us.
[02:11:29.581 --> 02:11:30.241]  So much happening.
[02:11:31.345 --> 02:11:31.945]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:11:31.985 --> 02:11:33.166]  Hi, Robert.
[02:11:33.266 --> 02:11:35.368]  Agentfortruth.com will work just fine.
[02:11:35.488 --> 02:11:38.690]  There's a little issue, but if people type that in, that'll work just fine.
[02:11:38.710 --> 02:11:40.812]  Just type that into the search engine or Joe Bannister will find it.
[02:11:41.533 --> 02:11:42.473]  Yeah, great.
[02:11:42.513 --> 02:11:43.174]  Great to see you.
[02:11:43.194 --> 02:11:44.274]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:11:44.674 --> 02:11:46.135]  Real excited about the new book.
[02:11:47.236 --> 02:11:57.180]  The original book, of course, 20 years ago, just just before you interviewed me when I resigned from the IRS, was investigating the federal income tax, a preliminary report.
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.061]  I tend to be pretty humble.
[02:12:00.201 --> 02:12:03.743]  And of course, I wasn't sure at the time if maybe I had missed something.
[02:12:03.763 --> 02:12:08.125]  Of course, I'm not a superior court judge or Supreme Court justice.
[02:12:09.185 --> 02:12:16.890]  But I did the best that I could, being a CPA at the time and an IRS criminal investigator who had taken an oath to support and defend the Constitution.
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:25.826]  And so I called it a preliminary report 20 years ago, and I think I've certainly reached the point where I can call it a report to the American people.
[02:12:26.467 --> 02:12:36.114]  I've been trying to tell the American people about this issue for 20 years, and the person that's helped me get that message out really the best has been you, Alex, and of course your whole crew.
[02:12:36.134 --> 02:12:38.917]  Well, I appreciate that, but Joe, let's talk about
[02:12:39.767 --> 02:12:40.287]  Your findings.
[02:12:40.307 --> 02:12:42.329]  We're gonna go break in a moment, come back in a longer segment.
[02:12:42.729 --> 02:12:43.830]  What is the IRS?
[02:12:44.050 --> 02:12:45.471]  What is the 1913 Act?
[02:12:45.891 --> 02:12:47.012]  What is the Federal Reserve?
[02:12:47.052 --> 02:12:53.316]  I mean, just in a three-minute summation of all your deep research on the inside and the outside, what is it and what are they hiding?
[02:12:54.497 --> 02:13:02.962]  What the people need to know is that in 1913, both the Federal Reserve Act and the 16th Amendment came into existence.
[02:13:03.142 --> 02:13:04.703]  And that wasn't a coincidence.
[02:13:05.624 --> 02:13:08.966]  The monetary system and the income tax are joined at the hip.
[02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:18.065]  They're married they have to be because one can't really function without the other So people need to understand that that coincidence.
[02:13:18.125 --> 02:13:37.036]  It's not a coincidence 1913 some very significant things happened to our country and that was the start of You know now over a hundred years of fraud and deceit I know a lot of your listeners are well familiar with the Federal Reserve the you know creation of fiat money and
[02:13:38.231 --> 02:13:45.594]  But the thing is, our founders, you know, they tried to protect us from the dystopia that we now find ourselves living in.
[02:13:46.614 --> 02:13:54.397]  And so, thankfully, the income tax and the Federal Reserve are like these square pegs that they try to put into the round hole.
[02:13:54.858 --> 02:13:55.778]  They just don't fit.
[02:13:56.790 --> 02:14:04.575]  So, of course, that's why I would encourage people to check out the book, check out my website, and look at old videos.
[02:14:05.055 --> 02:14:09.938]  Unfortunately, a lot of them have been banned, right, thanks to YouTube.
[02:14:10.118 --> 02:14:13.580]  Good information, truthful information, gets banned and censored.
[02:14:15.215 --> 02:14:16.275]  Well, that's my next point.
[02:14:16.335 --> 02:14:25.977]  I mean, they tried to put you in prison for your speech as a CPA, and now it's just widespread, just censorship, control everywhere, Robert.
[02:14:26.198 --> 02:14:26.738]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:14:26.778 --> 02:14:42.781]  I mean, in the 20 years that I've been involved in these issues with people I've represented, the person I've met of the most highest character, if I was in any kind of trouble, if I needed someone to look after my daughter, if I needed someone to look after everything related to me financially, if I needed anything like that, Joe Bannister would be at the top of that list.
[02:14:43.141 --> 02:14:46.183]  Talk about a man with an exceptional character, exceptional history.
[02:14:46.463 --> 02:14:47.203]  He won awards.
[02:14:47.403 --> 02:14:49.084]  He goes down to Glencoe to get training.
[02:14:49.284 --> 02:14:50.445]  They make him class president.
[02:14:50.645 --> 02:14:51.705]  That's who Joe Bannister is.
[02:14:52.005 --> 02:14:56.687]  And all he did, and you can tell by his demeanor and disposition, he's not some flamboyant person.
[02:14:57.048 --> 02:14:58.108]  He's not grandstanding.
[02:14:58.148 --> 02:14:59.489]  If anything, he tends to understate.
[02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:01.990]  And what he did is he just asked some questions.
[02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:07.053]  And people who had given him awards, given him honors, given him recognition, wouldn't answer those questions.
[02:15:07.353 --> 02:15:16.837]  Instead, they were so scared of the questions, they targeted him to take away his license, take away his right to practice, take away ultimately his freedom, and now they're trying to take away his speech.
[02:15:17.298 --> 02:15:22.060]  And it's been a pattern of, there's no reason to fear the speech if the speech is obviously false.
[02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:23.921]  We're going to go to break, but let's separate this.
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:28.704]  Let's say the income tax is legal and lawful, we know it's a fraud, makes you waive your Fourth Amendment, all that.
[02:15:29.025 --> 02:15:42.399]  Let's just say for the sake of debate, okay fine, it's selectively enforced, 50 CPAs give you a different answer, 50 lawyers give you a different answer, and then now it's a group that persecutes people for their political views, now it's over our healthcare records.
[02:15:42.919 --> 02:15:44.321]  It's like, it's the Gestapo!
[02:15:44.861 --> 02:15:47.482]  And so we'll get Joe Bannister's take on that and more.
[02:15:47.522 --> 02:15:51.123]  His new book just came out, Investigating the Federal Income Tax.
[02:15:51.183 --> 02:15:53.784]  It's the report to the American people, not the preliminary.
[02:15:53.804 --> 02:15:55.224]  20 years in the works.
[02:15:55.845 --> 02:15:56.925]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:15:56.985 --> 02:15:58.045]  Get your copy today, folks.
[02:15:58.325 --> 02:15:58.986]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:59.026 --> 02:15:59.746]  Just came out today.
[02:15:59.806 --> 02:16:00.286]  Stay with us.

[02:17:08.093 --> 02:17:09.074]  Debbie in New Jersey.
[02:17:09.114 --> 02:17:09.895]  Debbie, thanks for calling.
[02:17:09.915 --> 02:17:10.736]  I really appreciate you.
[02:17:11.076 --> 02:17:11.557]  Go ahead, Debbie.
[02:17:11.717 --> 02:17:17.683]  The shifting of Nancy Pelosi with those dentures, I wanted to just slap that bitch right across the mouth.
[02:17:17.783 --> 02:17:19.245]  I'm so sick of her ugly face.
[02:17:19.545 --> 02:17:20.026]  I am too.
[02:17:20.066 --> 02:17:20.866]  God, she's a demon.
[02:17:20.967 --> 02:17:22.628]  It's not about hating them.
[02:17:22.668 --> 02:17:24.310]  For me, it's about, it's embarrassing.
[02:17:24.350 --> 02:17:29.796]  Like, how do we have a group of people this bad, this evil, this stupid ruling over us?
[02:17:30.076 --> 02:17:31.057]  It makes me feel like crap.
[02:17:31.257 --> 02:17:31.897]  You know what, Alex?
[02:17:31.917 --> 02:17:34.859]  It's because we're on such an elevated plane.
[02:17:35.139 --> 02:17:42.763]  The people who are awake, we're so elevated in this dimension that it sickens us and makes us so ill, physically.
[02:17:42.903 --> 02:17:50.287]  It's just, it's so hard to look at people like that and want to even be kind to them because they just turn your frickin' stomach.
[02:17:50.347 --> 02:17:57.291]  But, um, the other thing I wanted to say is, Cortez, she looks like a rabid Boston carrier with those bulging eyeballs of hers, too.
[02:17:57.871 --> 02:17:58.952]  She really is demonic.
[02:17:59.352 --> 02:18:07.664]  You know, we can laugh about her, and I do, but it's like Beto and that, in his fake voice and how corrupt he is, it's like, this is their superstars?
[02:18:07.684 --> 02:18:10.929]  Beto O'Rourke and Alexandria Cortez?
[02:18:10.969 --> 02:18:12.210]  These people are idiots!
[02:18:12.671 --> 02:18:14.614]  And I'm not trying to be mean, it's just true!
[02:18:15.835 --> 02:18:16.255]  Yeah, no, it is.
[02:18:16.295 --> 02:18:16.496]  It is.
[02:18:16.796 --> 02:18:31.003]  Um, Alex, I'm gonna let you go, but I wanna let you know that my husband and I have every t-shirt, every product, because we love you, we love the Info Warriors, and everybody there that works there, we really thank the world to you people, and we are also lifetime Oath Keepers.
[02:18:31.223 --> 02:18:32.083]  Thank you, Stuart Rose.
[02:18:32.143 --> 02:18:32.564]  We love you.
[02:18:32.604 --> 02:18:32.844]  Thank you.
[02:18:32.864 --> 02:18:33.904]  Well, God bless you, Debbie.
[02:18:33.984 --> 02:18:34.865]  And let me just say this.
[02:18:35.065 --> 02:18:41.788]  I was in meetings this morning with accountants at the lawsuits they've got against us, and we beat, like, 15 of them, so they filed, like, five more.
[02:18:41.808 --> 02:18:44.750]  And I was just looking at this, and it was like,
[02:18:45.914 --> 02:18:50.798]  The enemy turns up the heat, you give us product purchases that just meet the level we need.
[02:18:50.818 --> 02:18:52.299]  We need financial support, folks.
[02:18:52.339 --> 02:18:55.601]  So I need everybody to go to m4restore.com and just realize that it's a war.

[02:21:04.099 --> 02:21:08.460]  I'm here live.
[02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:11.860]  They got War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:14.961]  with Owen Schroyer, David Knight, David Knight Show, 8 a.m.
[02:21:14.981 --> 02:21:15.401]  every morning.
[02:21:16.381 --> 02:21:19.882]  Well, I can say to an old friend, Joe Bannister, former Treasury agent,
[02:21:21.098 --> 02:21:27.905]  The whole story of how this happens is amazing, but we don't have time to tell today about listening to local radio, Federal Reserve is private, the income tax is a fraud.
[02:21:27.925 --> 02:21:29.246]  Well, I'm going to prove them wrong.
[02:21:29.286 --> 02:21:31.549]  Those researchers that ask questions, they say resign.
[02:21:32.830 --> 02:21:35.533]  Years later, he's just doing radio interviews and stuff.
[02:21:35.573 --> 02:21:36.634]  They indict him.
[02:21:37.775 --> 02:21:38.676]  The jury says no.
[02:21:38.696 --> 02:21:39.036]  So, Joe?
[02:21:41.781 --> 02:21:53.571]  Looking at the persecution the IRS has been involved in now, as I said before the break, and jump in Mr. Barnes, anytime you want, we'll go to Paul's next segment, all over the map.
[02:21:54.051 --> 02:21:55.893]  I know you're a smart guy, you can talk to any of these issues.
[02:21:58.875 --> 02:22:10.005]  Separate from debating whether the income tax is constitutional or not, what about it being this giant arm of persecution and being above the law and admitting it's doing it and not getting in trouble?
[02:22:12.170 --> 02:22:13.131]  That's absolutely right.
[02:22:13.311 --> 02:22:18.393]  I mean, I don't quite get why the American people aren't more incensed about this.
[02:22:18.473 --> 02:22:32.741]  I mean, if one of their neighbors was trying to control them or even a sibling or anyone, people would come unglued if they knew that somebody was trying to manipulate their thinking and swindle them.
[02:22:33.565 --> 02:22:44.114]  And yet, we have a federal government that over a span of 100 years has figured out a way to swindle, you know, hundreds of millions of people.
[02:22:44.894 --> 02:22:47.256]  By the way, I'm going to interrupt you because that was so profound.
[02:22:47.276 --> 02:22:54.562]  I mean, I'm sweet to my wife, she's sweet to me, but if I even joke around or she jokes around, hey, you're not going to tell me what to do.
[02:22:54.602 --> 02:22:55.403]  My kids are the same way.
[02:22:55.903 --> 02:22:58.866]  But if it's government or corrupt agencies, we just accept it.
[02:22:59.867 --> 02:23:00.988]  How is there that paradox?
[02:23:02.594 --> 02:23:11.840]  Well, like I said before, it's amazing to me that our founders knew what to protect against as best they could in the 1700s.
[02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:15.082]  And they gave us those protections.
[02:23:15.122 --> 02:23:26.609]  But of course, the missing link or the variable that's up to us is what we do to protect and to promote, preserve what they left to us.
[02:23:27.683 --> 02:23:32.104]  And that's that's where that variable hasn't been in the equation as much as it should be.
[02:23:32.504 --> 02:23:36.525]  And so it really is up to us to say we're tired of this.
[02:23:36.805 --> 02:23:38.385]  We've endured it for a long time.
[02:23:38.925 --> 02:23:47.007]  You've often said, Alex, about how people take our demeanor, our truthfulness, our humbleness, humility to be a weakness.
[02:23:47.847 --> 02:23:52.368]  And I think that's the way that the federal government, especially the taxing apparatus, views the public.
[02:23:53.789 --> 02:23:55.471]  It's very predatory.
[02:23:55.491 --> 02:23:57.733]  Because America is exceptional, it was exceptional.
[02:23:57.753 --> 02:24:00.176]  4% of the population had half the wealth in 1954.
[02:24:00.256 --> 02:24:11.608]  Now a lot of it's been stolen now, but it doesn't mean we're perfect, but compared to other nations, other systems, what was, to Joe and then to Robert Barnes, what is the American exceptionalism?
[02:24:11.628 --> 02:24:16.273]  Because all the media and Hollywood does is tell us how much we suck, how bad we are.
[02:24:16.693 --> 02:24:17.974]  Well, they own this country.
[02:24:17.994 --> 02:24:21.817]  Why would they devalue their own product because they're threatened by something?
[02:24:21.857 --> 02:24:23.899]  I think it's spiritual at the end of the day.
[02:24:24.359 --> 02:24:24.620]  Robert?
[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:25.080]  Sure.
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:35.548]  Well, I mean, I think at a certain core foundational level, the reason why Joe's questions raised such a stir was because it goes to the core of almost every political revolt and revolution that's ever happened in the history of the world.
[02:24:35.949 --> 02:24:39.191]  We'll start with a tax as its basis of a political revolt.
[02:24:39.432 --> 02:24:40.773]  That there's something that's wrong.
[02:24:40.833 --> 02:24:43.355]  And usually what they're complaining about is not monetary.
[02:24:43.595 --> 02:24:45.196]  They're not saying, oh, I want X amount of money.
[02:24:45.416 --> 02:24:49.720]  For example, in Joe's case, he put money aside for the trust in case there was any taxes actually.
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:51.581]  No, it says, this government doesn't represent me.
[02:24:51.741 --> 02:24:52.162]  Precisely.
[02:24:52.322 --> 02:24:52.942]  No, exactly.
[02:24:53.062 --> 02:24:54.123]  It goes to a spiritual issue.
[02:24:54.363 --> 02:24:57.166]  They're objecting not because they don't want to pay a certain amount of money.
[02:24:57.446 --> 02:25:00.368]  They're objecting because they're saying what's happening here is immoral.
[02:25:00.568 --> 02:25:01.789]  What's happening here is illegal.
[02:25:01.989 --> 02:25:03.531]  What's happening here is anti-democratic.
[02:25:03.771 --> 02:25:05.432]  What's happening here is against our founding principles.
[02:25:05.452 --> 02:25:07.213]  Because people will give if they think it's for good.
[02:25:07.534 --> 02:25:08.114]  Absolutely.
[02:25:08.134 --> 02:25:08.895]  They'll be happy to.
[02:25:09.215 --> 02:25:12.378]  In fact, we're the most charitable country in the world, by far.
[02:25:12.638 --> 02:25:15.380]  Our people are the most charitable country in the world, by far.
[02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:22.646]  So what they were scared of and what they're worried about is people saying, there's something about this system that's not being done consistent with our founding principles.
[02:25:23.026 --> 02:25:27.089]  And it's those founding, the people who have power, want to have that power without restraint.
[02:25:27.710 --> 02:25:28.310]  Exactly.
[02:25:28.450 --> 02:25:31.873]  The fact that we have so much freedom gets in the way of a vertical command.
[02:25:32.113 --> 02:25:32.613]  Precisely.
[02:25:32.634 --> 02:25:36.977]  They don't have the oligarchic, monopolistic, uniform control that they want.
[02:25:37.298 --> 02:25:46.346]  And people like Joe, who just took his obligation to the Constitution seriously, took what his duties were to the public seriously, is the one that has to be... And I want to be clear.
[02:25:46.666 --> 02:25:49.529]  The Pentagon has good people, but the globalists run it.
[02:25:50.049 --> 02:25:55.574]  And if you go back to Abel Daines and other documents, they said, we're not worried about bad people, we're worried about interesting people, and we're worried about
[02:25:56.215 --> 02:26:00.399]  Powered individuals that can motivate others and that would be a Joe Bannister.
[02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:03.142]  They're worried about people that actually have a compass.
[02:26:03.363 --> 02:26:08.908]  So Barnes has given his expert view on that and you've got an expert view on that as well.
[02:26:09.269 --> 02:26:11.431]  What is the lightning in a bottle they're so scared of?
[02:26:13.133 --> 02:26:17.117]  Well, as you pointed out, you and Infowars, Alex had pointed out,
[02:26:18.849 --> 02:26:28.775]  The deep state, the term deep state is understood by so many more Americans, and I've referred to the IRS and the Department of Justice as the original deep state operations.
[02:26:30.436 --> 02:26:36.700]  As Robert pointed out, you really can't orchestrate the level of tyranny
[02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:48.810]  That they are attempting to and succeeding in orchestrating if you do not have people by the you-know-what and that is done with the income tax and the monetary system.
[02:26:49.523 --> 02:26:59.088]  So, I'd hate to, you know, advocate to put, you know, this issue at the top because the priority list has thousands of... No, no, the power of the purse is the power of the power to tax, power to destroy.
[02:26:59.328 --> 02:27:01.629]  Well, look, they give the IRS all the jobs.
[02:27:02.109 --> 02:27:12.554]  I mean, I'm not supposed to say this shit because we're going to file lawsuits, but, well, I'll get to it later, but no, it's the IRS that's tasked with putting on your bank account, you're a hater now, so my A++ rating went to zero.
[02:27:13.034 --> 02:27:14.475]  And they take my bank accounts away, Joe.
[02:27:15.872 --> 02:27:31.061]  Well Alex, I'm glad you're at least telling people what's happening to you personally and to InfoWars because the fact of the matter is American people better start getting more active soon because as we go to a cashless society there will be no turning back.
[02:27:31.121 --> 02:27:37.385]  You will have no property that you can call your own that you have in your possession and they'll flick a switch and you'll be done.
[02:27:37.405 --> 02:27:42.128]  It won't even be done talking to people and exercising your First Amendment right.
[02:27:42.468 --> 02:27:43.509]  You're going to be done eating.
[02:27:45.038 --> 02:27:45.819]  That's so profound.
[02:27:45.839 --> 02:27:49.203]  I was going to bring that up today because you're a CPA accountant or a treasury agent.
[02:27:49.223 --> 02:27:50.544]  You're a lawyer, tax expert.
[02:27:51.445 --> 02:27:53.687]  They're already abusing the cashless system.
[02:27:53.988 --> 02:27:55.569]  A bunch of countries are going cashless.
[02:27:55.850 --> 02:27:57.712]  They can already control what I can type on my phone.
[02:27:59.213 --> 02:28:04.018]  And so now they're going to have control at the level of your phone of what news you look at.
[02:28:04.378 --> 02:28:07.141]  And now they're saying, you don't play ball, we'll just...
[02:28:07.822 --> 02:28:11.605]  Your credit card, even though you paid that money, you worked, you put it in the bank, it's worthless.
[02:28:11.666 --> 02:28:12.206]  It's all gone.
[02:28:12.466 --> 02:28:12.947]  Precisely.
[02:28:12.967 --> 02:28:14.528]  And it relates to what Joe talks about.
[02:28:14.788 --> 02:28:19.933]  Their method of controlling speech is through the same banking financial system predicated upon the Federal Reserve.
[02:28:20.293 --> 02:28:23.556]  And the Federal Reserve is the banking elite which uses the IRS as its enforcer.
[02:28:23.576 --> 02:28:24.157]  So Joe's like...
[02:28:24.517 --> 02:28:26.618]  I don't want to say my issue is the king of the hill.
[02:28:26.758 --> 02:28:27.358]  No, it is.
[02:28:27.698 --> 02:28:28.078]  Yeah, it is.
[02:28:28.298 --> 02:28:32.320]  Because at the core of it, there's no political... Noam Chomsky said this back in the 1960s.
[02:28:32.540 --> 02:28:38.982]  He said if you seriously want to change the Vietnam War, then don't pay income tax and challenge how the income tax is being used for the war.
[02:28:39.302 --> 02:28:41.403]  He said because that's the only thing that would actually be successful.
[02:28:41.623 --> 02:28:43.583]  All the war protests in the world ain't gonna do nothing.
[02:28:43.824 --> 02:28:49.105]  You get 10-20% of the people to look at the tax system as a way of war protest, you're gonna shut down a war tomorrow.
[02:28:49.325 --> 02:28:52.166]  The tax system, the financial system, is the key to everything.
[02:28:52.306 --> 02:28:53.627]  Let's talk about it with Joe Bannister.
[02:28:54.227 --> 02:28:56.450]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:28:56.470 --> 02:28:57.711]  I talk about voting with your dollars.
[02:29:15.686 --> 02:29:18.248]  And I talk about the power of you taking action.
[02:29:18.308 --> 02:29:26.674]  But if you'll just buy... We already go out and get the very best Chiapas, High Mountain, Southern Mexico, around the border of Guatemala coffee.
[02:29:26.694 --> 02:29:29.055]  And we sell it for $10 less a pound than Whole Foods does.
[02:29:29.136 --> 02:29:30.456]  Make like $8, they make like $20.
[02:29:31.017 --> 02:29:33.719]  If you'll just go get our fluoride-free toothpaste, Coil Silver Iodine, 4 to 5.
[02:29:34.019 --> 02:29:39.004]  You'll just get our protein bars that are $2.40 a piece instead of $7 like Whole Foods sells them.
[02:29:39.105 --> 02:29:40.826]  It's the same bar, private label.
[02:29:40.907 --> 02:29:42.769]  This is the best high-end bar.
[02:29:42.789 --> 02:29:44.170]  15 grams of amazing proteins.
[02:29:44.210 --> 02:29:44.771]  Tastes so good.
[02:29:44.791 --> 02:29:45.371]  It's amazing.
[02:29:45.532 --> 02:29:48.034]  Vanilla, coconut, chocolate, peanut butter.
[02:29:48.275 --> 02:29:49.156]  Get it today.
[02:29:49.356 --> 02:29:50.257]  InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:29:50.277 --> 02:29:53.060]  If you'll just get your coffee, your toothpaste, and your bars from us.
[02:29:53.240 --> 02:29:55.301]  And sign up for auto-ship, conditional 10% off.
[02:29:55.501 --> 02:29:58.222]  Our problems fighting Hillary and Soros are over.
[02:29:58.342 --> 02:29:59.603]  I want to produce news reports.
[02:30:00.063 --> 02:30:01.143]  I want to produce articles.
[02:30:01.323 --> 02:30:05.925]  I want to fight them and not run around trying to make money to fund the operation.
[02:30:05.945 --> 02:30:10.727]  So thank you for your support, but commit today to MFORWARDSHOW.COM and get those
[02:30:11.567 --> 02:30:19.873]  What you're doing with offering these various products, you're really revolutionizing the entire business model of where people get the daily consumption products that they need.
[02:30:20.413 --> 02:30:21.734]  People do vote with their dollars.
[02:30:21.894 --> 02:30:28.899]  Well, as you keep rolling out products, and your team is doing such an amazing job of doing that, people are going to keep shifting to you.
[02:30:29.139 --> 02:30:35.763]  And your long-term strategy, it's obvious this isn't insider information, it's just to offer more and more products that people use every day.
[02:30:35.924 --> 02:30:38.225]  And so people can vote for freedom and vote for liberty.
[02:30:41.528 --> 02:30:46.234]  Protein bar, and then it's all handled, and I get the best deal out there, and then I fund freedom.
[02:30:46.575 --> 02:30:46.976]  It's simple.
[02:30:47.096 --> 02:30:49.299]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsTore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:31:07.069 --> 02:31:10.331]  This is a solution for you and your family.
[02:31:10.651 --> 02:31:15.555]  This is something guaranteed, like oxygen and water, to sustain life.
[02:31:15.735 --> 02:31:17.456]  There are a bunch of bad halogens.
[02:31:17.556 --> 02:31:21.258]  There is one good halogen in the body, and it's pure atomic iodine.
[02:31:21.398 --> 02:31:23.400]  Most forms are bound, so you don't absorb them.
[02:31:23.480 --> 02:31:34.527]  But even microscopic amounts of the broken-down type are better than nothing, because your body recognizes it and takes it on, and tries to use it instead of bromine, chloride, fluorine, and the other bad ones.
[02:31:34.867 --> 02:31:37.510]  And there's a lot of things better than just wealth in this world.
[02:31:37.630 --> 02:31:38.731]  How about physical wealth?
[02:31:39.071 --> 02:31:41.133]  When I forget to take my iodine, I'm an idiot.
[02:31:41.633 --> 02:31:42.694]  We have X2.
[02:31:42.794 --> 02:31:48.059]  It's selling out because a company tried to put me over the barrel from the oil well company that drills to get it to 12,000 feet.
[02:31:48.500 --> 02:31:50.041]  We ended up finding an even better company.
[02:31:50.221 --> 02:31:56.207]  Their chemist said, you can put this in the way you have it, but you should add a little bit of vitamin C to stabilize it so it doesn't oxidize.
[02:31:56.347 --> 02:31:59.650]  And this other form of iodine, and the other form, all three, so that it's
[02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:00.490]  We're good to go.
[02:32:15.197 --> 02:32:17.559]  Raising the world's IQ, the secret is salt.
[02:32:17.639 --> 02:32:18.080]  But it's not.
[02:32:18.100 --> 02:32:18.680]  It says right here.
[02:32:18.860 --> 02:32:21.282]  Adding ionized iodine to the salt.
[02:32:21.343 --> 02:32:23.104]  Boosted IQ 10 to 20 points.
[02:32:23.304 --> 02:32:24.245]  Increased fertility.
[02:32:24.345 --> 02:32:27.688]  They put it in the water the kids are given at school in China.
[02:32:28.008 --> 02:32:28.869]  Why do I say that?
[02:32:29.009 --> 02:32:35.335]  Because in the 20s, we had major reproductive problems, major deformities, major retardation.
[02:32:35.715 --> 02:32:42.459]  Major IQ reduction, not on the coastal areas, where people got fresh fish that had some iodine in it, but in the Midwest.
[02:32:42.499 --> 02:32:47.922]  You fund us, and you get atomic iodine with the other two types of iodine, so it's fully absorbable.
[02:32:48.043 --> 02:32:50.404]  That's why we have Survival Shield X3.
[02:32:50.504 --> 02:32:53.006]  I can keep selling X2 until the cows come home, and it's there.
[02:32:53.126 --> 02:32:54.466]  But this, this is the best.
[02:32:54.667 --> 02:32:57.768]  X3, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:33:06.334 --> 02:33:09.057]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.463 --> 02:33:19.549]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:43.514 --> 02:33:56.185]  Joe Bannister, a fellow I've known for at least 20 years, former Treasury agent.
[02:33:56.966 --> 02:34:00.308]  Just asked questions, they told him to resign, he went public, spoke out about it.
[02:34:00.849 --> 02:34:02.771]  Boom, they tried to put him in prison repeatedly.
[02:34:04.053 --> 02:34:10.798]  One of the lawyers that worked with him on some of these cases, Robert Barnes, just happens to be here working on some of my First Amendment cases right now and doing a great job.
[02:34:12.279 --> 02:34:13.400]  I promise to go to your call.
[02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:23.107]  So we're going to keep Bannister and you guys about 15 minutes to the next hour so we can get more into the things that both you guys want to get into, which is Joe Bannister's dealing for the deep state.
[02:34:24.289 --> 02:34:30.693]  Joe's message to President Trump and so much more in his new book, Investigating the Federal Income Tax Reports the American People.
[02:34:31.214 --> 02:34:33.675]  When he first issued one 20 years ago, it was called the Preliminary Report.
[02:34:33.735 --> 02:34:34.116]  I remember that.
[02:34:34.456 --> 02:34:36.737]  Well, now this is the report.
[02:34:37.918 --> 02:34:38.759]  It's very, very important.
[02:34:38.779 --> 02:34:42.021]  Everybody get it at InfowarsTor.com to understand what you're dealing with.
[02:34:42.061 --> 02:34:52.228]  Now, before we go any further, speaking of the devil, which is money, we have
[02:34:53.866 --> 02:34:58.149]  A bigger audience than we've ever had when it comes to actual movers and shakers.
[02:34:59.330 --> 02:35:00.490]  And activists, smart people.
[02:35:01.451 --> 02:35:05.473]  Our influence, and I don't just say this to act cool or powerful, it's actually scary.
[02:35:06.194 --> 02:35:08.395]  Our influence is greater than it's ever been.
[02:35:10.377 --> 02:35:12.658]  I told you the people that have called me the last week.
[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:16.560]  Basically threatening me.
[02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:17.541]  In a very loving way.
[02:35:18.482 --> 02:35:20.543]  I mean, it's household names beyond that.
[02:35:20.963 --> 02:35:21.844]  People I thought
[02:35:23.148 --> 02:35:25.849]  We're on board with never backing down.
[02:35:26.249 --> 02:35:32.412]  The globalists are behind the scenes running intelligence operations, threatening everyone, and seeing who they can get.
[02:35:33.273 --> 02:35:34.954]  Well, if you don't want money, how about fear?
[02:35:35.614 --> 02:35:41.917]  And you're going to lose, because they're getting their move ready on Trump, because he's shaking up the entire system.
[02:35:42.917 --> 02:35:48.260]  But when it comes down to financially supporting InfoWars, it's not critical, it's essential.
[02:35:49.471 --> 02:35:53.693]  So I know the vast majority of you spread the articles, you tell folks about the show, that's great.
[02:35:55.714 --> 02:36:09.161]  But if you'll just get your toothpaste from us, if you'll just get your coffee from us, if you'll just get your protein bars from us, they're all the highest quality, at lower prices than you'll get at Whole Foods, and you just get staples from us, and it funds the operation.
[02:36:10.062 --> 02:36:12.203]  And we have the new Strength and Recovery Combo.
[02:36:12.283 --> 02:36:17.846]  Our Turmeric Bodies Ultimate Turmeric Formula is 95% curcuminoid, leading competitors 5%.
[02:36:19.781 --> 02:36:21.003]  And people get a good result on that.
[02:36:21.203 --> 02:36:24.046]  Everybody knows about turmeric for inflammation, all of it.
[02:36:24.106 --> 02:36:32.677]  And then of course, we also have alpha power that goes with it, that has all the natural healthy herbs for stamina, libido, energy.
[02:36:33.318 --> 02:36:34.840]  Quite frankly, I can't even take it.
[02:36:36.203 --> 02:36:38.224]  Because I actually, for my age, have a high testosterone level.
[02:36:38.645 --> 02:36:45.490]  I've had my blood tested and things, and the problem is it retrogrades and turns into estrogen too quickly, and there's things like that.
[02:36:45.530 --> 02:36:48.472]  But the point is, I take Alpha Power, I bounce off the walls.
[02:36:48.592 --> 02:36:52.535]  The average person, though, has way low testosterone, all sorts of issues.
[02:36:52.595 --> 02:36:55.917]  We went out and said, what is the ultimate formula?
[02:36:55.957 --> 02:36:56.918]  And we just made it stronger.
[02:36:56.958 --> 02:36:57.579]  That's Alpha Power.
[02:36:57.859 --> 02:37:01.762]  They're both together, 50% off, at InfoWorksStore.com, right now, today.
[02:37:02.953 --> 02:37:04.274]  And it'll blow you away.
[02:37:04.654 --> 02:37:07.075]  So take advantage of that at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:37:07.616 --> 02:37:11.338]  We're going to go to phone calls for this segment and the next, which will be all over the map.
[02:37:11.358 --> 02:37:12.399]  But you guys are both smart.
[02:37:12.419 --> 02:37:13.599]  You can chime in on it.
[02:37:13.619 --> 02:37:18.162]  And then we'll get into the IRS and Bannister's message to Trump.
[02:37:18.182 --> 02:37:21.744]  We'll get your message to Trump, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer as well.
[02:37:22.104 --> 02:37:25.166]  But because people have been holding so long, who's been holding the longest?
[02:37:25.186 --> 02:37:27.867]  We've got Mitchell is an hour and 12 minutes.
[02:37:28.788 --> 02:37:29.949]  Freedom Fighter, an hour and 20 minutes.
[02:37:31.471 --> 02:37:36.755]  Hey Alex McMahon, first of all I want to say Brainforce is the best investment you can make in yourself and your career.
[02:37:36.795 --> 02:37:37.355]  I take it every day.
[02:38:01.495 --> 02:38:05.176]  We went out and found the top nootropic and just discounted the price, but thank you, sir.
[02:38:05.456 --> 02:38:06.456]  Shoshua, what do you disagree with?
[02:38:06.496 --> 02:38:06.796]  Go ahead.
[02:38:08.156 --> 02:38:17.018]  What you said about Rubio earlier in the Kagame tweet, I am very close to somebody who is in the media business quite a lot.
[02:38:17.098 --> 02:38:20.979]  And they would be kind of on the entertainment side, like a capricious or tappy.
[02:38:22.379 --> 02:38:23.740]  And they've talked to these politicians.
[02:38:23.860 --> 02:38:24.940]  They've talked to the generals.
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:26.680]  They've talked to people in the military.
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:28.861]  And they're scared.
[02:38:29.301 --> 02:38:30.781]  And they could end this right now.
[02:38:31.414 --> 02:38:32.895]  They could kill Maduro and end it.
[02:38:33.976 --> 02:38:36.177]  But they don't think America's going to come.
[02:38:36.377 --> 02:38:38.019]  They don't think there's going to be a war.
[02:38:39.279 --> 02:38:41.001]  And they think this is going to go on forever.
[02:38:41.601 --> 02:38:45.804]  There's some 1% that controls all the wealth.
[02:38:47.125 --> 02:38:50.087]  So I kind of get what Rubio was doing.
[02:38:50.127 --> 02:38:52.909]  By the way, Rubio, if you're listening, you know who this is.
[02:38:52.989 --> 02:38:58.753]  Alex, you probably know who it is because I've sent you videos through Showtips that they have sent me.
[02:38:59.781 --> 02:39:02.084]  Since the 23rd of last month.
[02:39:03.185 --> 02:39:05.307]  Gateway Pundit has published on the Miami Herald.
[02:39:06.128 --> 02:39:09.331]  But yeah, it's pretty bad down there.
[02:39:09.391 --> 02:39:11.734]  This is about the closest you can come to the Holocaust.
[02:39:12.294 --> 02:39:14.717]  And whatever we're seeing in the news, it's even worse.
[02:39:16.239 --> 02:39:17.380]  And something's got to be done.
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:19.262]  And I hope, I hope Mr. Maduro
[02:39:21.009 --> 02:39:33.055]  Well, the word is, it is societal collapse in the midst of volcanic soil, the best growing area, oil, diamonds, everything is collapsing.
[02:39:33.435 --> 02:39:35.036]  I appreciate your call.
[02:39:35.056 --> 02:39:36.617]  Let's get Joe Bannister's take on that.
[02:39:37.157 --> 02:39:41.959]  Everywhere we see socialism failing, communism failing, but then AOC's promoting it.
[02:39:42.239 --> 02:39:44.620]  What do you think should be done about Venezuela?
[02:39:45.021 --> 02:39:49.543]  Because I don't want to do regime change, because usually the neocons just make it worse, but what do we do about this?
[02:39:51.325 --> 02:39:59.669]  Well, I'm certainly concerned about the America's track record for intervening in other quagmires.
[02:39:59.869 --> 02:40:05.612]  And of course, I'm also concerned about the excuses that are used to bring us into those quagmires.
[02:40:06.613 --> 02:40:10.835]  And now those excuses don't generally turn out to be truthful.
[02:40:11.815 --> 02:40:12.856]  So I don't know.
[02:40:13.076 --> 02:40:16.598]  But as far as the socialism goes, you know, Venezuela is certainly a good
[02:40:18.624 --> 02:40:33.699]  A good illustration of where it goes, and I again would like the American people to recognize that the income tax and the Federal Reserve are the mechanisms that can take a country into socialism and has gone quite a ways.
[02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:43.647]  By the way, exactly, there's a monetary global system in the last hundred years that puts in the exact things the fellow deserve in these countries before they take them from wealthy to poor.
[02:40:44.068 --> 02:40:44.628]  Oh, precisely.
[02:40:44.688 --> 02:40:53.236]  And it's also now become the tools and the primary means and mechanism by which you can control speech, censor speech, shame speech, isolate speech.
[02:40:53.416 --> 02:40:59.741]  They started this out on people like Joe, where the IRS was bringing special actions to prevent him from being able to fundraise in his own defense.
[02:41:01.622 --> 02:41:06.285]  So they tested it out against Joe, and now they're doing it more broad scale, more wholesale.
[02:41:06.625 --> 02:41:08.807]  And what you see in Venezuela... By the way, you're not just saying that.
[02:41:08.847 --> 02:41:09.767]  He was a famous case.
[02:41:09.787 --> 02:41:10.828]  He was patient zero.
[02:41:11.068 --> 02:41:11.829]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:41:12.069 --> 02:41:14.010]  It was a huge privilege to represent Joe.
[02:41:14.310 --> 02:41:18.313]  And that was a liberal jury that said not guilty of all charges, period.
[02:41:18.573 --> 02:41:20.314]  That he didn't have any fraudulent intent.
[02:41:20.334 --> 02:41:21.775]  That he didn't have any criminal intent.
[02:41:21.955 --> 02:41:25.257]  In fact, what the jury said was that the con was on the side of the prosecution.
[02:41:25.557 --> 02:41:28.739]  That was the closing argument that I co-wrote with Jeffrey Dickstein.
[02:41:29.079 --> 02:41:30.941]  Which was, which side is the con on?
[02:41:31.441 --> 02:41:35.986]  And I remember brainstorming it in a decent little hotel in Sacramento, which otherwise I don't recommend.
[02:41:36.026 --> 02:41:36.726]  God bless the city.
[02:41:37.067 --> 02:41:46.816]  But basically led to that outcome, but the effect of that outcome stayed the government's hand and stayed the system's hand, but it didn't stop them from going on their ultimate path.
[02:41:47.116 --> 02:41:47.176]  And
[02:42:02.073 --> 02:42:02.553]  I was about to say!
[02:42:27.014 --> 02:42:28.815]  Venezuela 10 years ago wasn't this bad.
[02:42:29.175 --> 02:42:31.817]  It incrementally just gets worse as they need more control.
[02:42:31.977 --> 02:42:32.357]  Precisely.
[02:42:32.377 --> 02:42:35.359]  Because the other back story here is this is really a proxy war with China.
[02:42:35.859 --> 02:42:37.740]  Because it's China that's deeply embedded.
[02:42:37.780 --> 02:42:43.524]  As you noted earlier, China was using Venezuela as a test case for their social media crediting policies.
[02:42:43.904 --> 02:42:44.764]  So that's what's happening.
[02:42:44.804 --> 02:42:49.687]  Venezuela was sort of like a proxy of China in the way Cuba used to be a proxy of the Soviet Union.
[02:42:49.707 --> 02:42:51.068]  And it looks like it's not going too well.
[02:42:51.368 --> 02:42:52.669]  Oh no, it's completely failed.
[02:42:52.889 --> 02:42:55.090]  The only thing it's holding... Oh, we'll take your credit away.
[02:42:55.190 --> 02:42:56.091]  I'll just burn everything down.
[02:42:56.591 --> 02:42:56.972]  Exactly.
[02:42:56.992 --> 02:42:57.953]  It didn't function at all.
[02:42:58.134 --> 02:42:58.815]  People are starving.
[02:42:59.155 --> 02:43:01.158]  So the... it doesn't ultimately... Hold on, hold on.
[02:43:01.178 --> 02:43:01.459]  Stay there.
[02:43:01.479 --> 02:43:02.360]  We'll be right back with Joe Bannon.
[02:43:03.237 --> 02:43:08.461]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[02:43:38.184 --> 02:43:44.870]  Alpha Power can help boost performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[02:43:45.410 --> 02:43:48.693]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.

[02:43:52.136 --> 02:43:59.543]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power at 50% off only at the Info Wars store.
[02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:07.101]  This bar, at its regular price, is a little over $3.
[02:44:08.061 --> 02:44:11.222]  When we have it discounted, it's about $2.50 a piece.
[02:44:12.963 --> 02:44:16.543]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece at Whole Foods.
[02:44:16.924 --> 02:44:17.664]  This is high-end.
[02:44:18.344 --> 02:44:21.565]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.
[02:44:21.605 --> 02:44:25.686]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[02:44:26.306 --> 02:44:34.734]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturing developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[02:44:35.194 --> 02:44:37.416]  It's available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:44:37.616 --> 02:44:37.997]  It's simple.
[02:44:38.017 --> 02:44:43.622]  You get the highest quality protein bars in two different flavors and you fund the war against the globalists.
[02:44:44.142 --> 02:44:46.163]  And the attempt that we're engaged in to take the country back.
[02:44:46.503 --> 02:44:46.904]  It's simple.
[02:44:47.424 --> 02:44:53.087]  Go shop with the good guys at InfoWarsStore.com and break the back of the globalists and get high quality super discounts.
[02:44:53.387 --> 02:45:00.391]  Or keep shopping with Jeff Bezos and Amazon and keep going to Whole Foods that are actually funding the Washington Post and the globalists attempt to destroy this country.
[02:45:00.731 --> 02:45:01.271]  It's that simple.
[02:45:01.731 --> 02:45:02.612]  InfoWarsLive.com
[02:45:05.291 --> 02:45:08.732]  I cannot say enough nice things about Super Male Vitality right here.
[02:45:09.032 --> 02:45:10.373]  I actually have three of them on my desk.
[02:45:10.413 --> 02:45:11.233]  This is my favorite.
[02:45:11.253 --> 02:45:13.794]  It's heartbreaking that it's going away, I really think.
[02:45:14.194 --> 02:45:15.095]  I mean, really, it's true.
[02:45:15.155 --> 02:45:18.176]  Ever since I've tried these two here, I've also got another one sitting here.
[02:45:18.336 --> 02:45:20.277]  Alpha Power, Super Male Vitality.
[02:45:20.397 --> 02:45:23.338]  They have given me the energy that I did not have.
[02:45:23.418 --> 02:45:26.479]  I mean, my God, I didn't realize how little I was doing before.
[02:45:26.519 --> 02:45:30.521]  With these two here, I have the energy to go to the gym at the end of a long day of working.
[02:45:30.561 --> 02:45:33.262]  At the end of doing a broadcast, I have the energy to go to a gym.
[02:45:33.362 --> 02:45:33.922]  And frankly,
[02:45:34.182 --> 02:45:36.843]  I really think this is better than anything you're going to get in the store.
[02:45:36.883 --> 02:45:39.924]  It's heartbreaking that Super Male Vitality is about to go away.
[02:45:39.964 --> 02:45:43.465]  And again, it's just because you can't find the herbs and you don't want to sell us crap.
[02:45:43.505 --> 02:45:44.605]  But that's what it's all about.
[02:45:44.625 --> 02:45:45.826]  This is the real deal.
[02:45:45.866 --> 02:45:50.587]  You take two droplets of this a couple times a day and all of a sudden it's like, whoa, I'm a man again.
[02:45:50.847 --> 02:45:55.989]  I have all the power that a steady diet of soy fed through government schools robbed me of.
[02:45:56.049 --> 02:45:56.629]  It's back.
[02:45:57.049 --> 02:45:59.691]  So between that, I've got my X2 right here.
[02:45:59.832 --> 02:46:04.636]  Everything else I've tried, I have a filter in my house, a water filter I just bought for my family.
[02:46:04.756 --> 02:46:07.078]  Everybody loves everything in the InfoWars store.
[02:46:07.198 --> 02:46:08.819]  Everything is very reasonably priced.
[02:46:08.939 --> 02:46:10.020]  You're supporting the show.
[02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:11.321]  You're supporting the InfoWars.
[02:46:11.421 --> 02:46:14.544]  And really, as conservatives, who are you going to give your money to?
[02:46:14.604 --> 02:46:19.949]  Are you going to go to the supplement store and give it to somebody who probably advertises on Roku?
[02:46:20.089 --> 02:46:22.531]  Or are you going to give your money directly to Alex Jones?
[02:46:22.631 --> 02:46:23.912]  It's an easy choice, I think.
[02:46:23.972 --> 02:46:29.737]  These are exciting times we live in, and yes, super male vitality versus female vitality is an aging process.
[02:46:29.797 --> 02:46:30.458]  It's cold-pressed.
[02:46:30.558 --> 02:46:36.023]  It takes three to four times more of the herbs to do it, and it's super, super strong for libido, stamina, energy.
[02:46:36.103 --> 02:46:41.868]  When I first heard about it, like, six, seven years ago that it was being developed, and I actually tried it, I was like, okay, this actually works.
[02:46:42.188 --> 02:46:46.150]  I mean, I lost 60, 70 pounds with the X2 and with the SuperMetal Vitality.
[02:46:46.270 --> 02:46:48.310]  I've gained a few pounds back because I barely work out anymore.
[02:46:48.410 --> 02:46:54.573]  And if I wasn't taking it and wasn't taking the X2 and X3, I would definitely be pushing 300 pounds right now.
[02:46:54.833 --> 02:46:59.674]  So get your SuperMetal Vitality, the final run, unless me squeezing them makes it way down on the price.
[02:46:59.754 --> 02:47:01.035]  So get it today while you still can.
[02:47:06.357 --> 02:47:09.118]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:53.843 --> 02:47:55.304]  Joe Bannister is our guest.
[02:47:56.165 --> 02:48:01.609]  I want to invite him back up for a full hour in the near future, just he and I, to take IRS questions for folks.
[02:48:01.649 --> 02:48:06.793]  But his new book is out, Investigating the Federal Income Tax, at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:48:06.813 --> 02:48:09.716]  It's also on his website, Asia for Truth.
[02:48:10.937 --> 02:48:16.341]  And this isn't somebody saying if there's gold fringe on the flag, that it means... I'm not knocking people to think that.
[02:48:17.362 --> 02:48:18.343]  My point is, this is not
[02:48:20.373 --> 02:48:24.725]  It's not hyperbole, it's not rumors, it's not... because here's the deal.
[02:48:26.004 --> 02:48:31.789]  People want to believe, hey, the law says this, as you said last night, so government's breaking it, there must be a second set of law.
[02:48:31.849 --> 02:48:32.749]  No, they're just breaking it.
[02:48:33.310 --> 02:48:34.851]  And that's why I'm not against the QAnon thing.
[02:48:34.891 --> 02:48:45.840]  Oh, it's great to believe there's a great secret group and everything's fixed and everything's wonderful and, you know, BuzzFeed is, you know, outing some pastry maker at the President's Mar-a-Lago, wanting her fired, being bullies.
[02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:49.643]  Great, QAnon, wonderful, okay, the government's all wonderful, we're gonna fix it.
[02:48:50.103 --> 02:48:51.425]  The point is, is that
[02:48:52.369 --> 02:49:05.546]  People need to know what's really the research is, 20 years like Joe Bannister's done, like you've done, versus what some guy just claims, oh, this is how it is, just do this, you'll be fine.
[02:49:05.566 --> 02:49:10.593]  Because nine times out of ten, you go to prison with the made up gold fringe flag thing.
[02:49:11.499 --> 02:49:12.059]  Correct, exactly.
[02:49:12.079 --> 02:49:16.401]  In fact, a lot of those ideas came into marginalized people who had serious and sincere questions.
[02:49:16.801 --> 02:49:19.943]  You had a lot of people who said... They're like, why am I waiving my 5th Amendment or 4th Amendment?
[02:49:20.283 --> 02:49:20.703]  Exactly.
[02:49:20.723 --> 02:49:22.504]  I mean, why is the law written this way?
[02:49:22.524 --> 02:49:24.505]  I mean, why can't you answer just this basic question?
[02:49:24.765 --> 02:49:26.085]  Why can't you just respond to me?
[02:49:26.685 --> 02:49:31.267]  90% of the people that are targeted in this area just asked questions that the IRS refused to answer.
[02:49:31.548 --> 02:49:31.968]  That's all.
[02:49:32.308 --> 02:49:34.809]  And all Joe did was go through and he's just sharing his experience.
[02:49:35.069 --> 02:49:39.913]  Here's what happened, here's what I researched, here's the techniques I have, and you draw your own conclusions.
[02:49:40.154 --> 02:49:45.158]  You empower ordinary people to make decisions, to take political action based on your political speech.
[02:49:45.459 --> 02:49:49.162]  And yet he was targeted, and they tried to lock him up in prison for more than a decade.
[02:49:49.502 --> 02:49:54.367]  I mean, that was the goal and objective, and it was a liberal lefty jury who found him not guilty of all charges.
[02:49:54.727 --> 02:49:56.888]  They were the ones who said, this should never have happened.
[02:49:57.128 --> 02:49:59.450]  They thought our legal team, actually, they thought all of us were lefties.
[02:49:59.790 --> 02:50:02.011]  I mean, because that was the nature of the case.
[02:50:02.312 --> 02:50:06.154]  Because what we presented is, Joe is being targeted purely for political reasons.
[02:50:06.474 --> 02:50:09.996]  No one could be around Joe and come to the conclusion that he was anything other than honest.
[02:50:10.076 --> 02:50:13.178]  Well, as bad as the old left was, they were still for free speech and things.
[02:50:13.658 --> 02:50:20.482]  The new left, Joe Bannister, what would you call the new left and what they've kind of morphed into or mutated into?
[02:50:23.306 --> 02:50:29.312]  Why are you saying the IRS is the deep state?
[02:50:29.432 --> 02:50:32.815]  The left of today is just tyrants.
[02:50:34.137 --> 02:50:35.258]  You've put it very well.
[02:50:35.718 --> 02:50:38.381]  I have 20 years of hindsight to look back at.
[02:50:39.159 --> 02:50:48.442]  And so hopefully people will believe me when I say that Alex Jones has been telling you this stuff since the very beginning.
[02:50:49.163 --> 02:50:51.964]  You've been painting the picture for the public, Alex.
[02:50:52.304 --> 02:50:55.965]  And that's why I'm not just a guest, occasional guest on your show.
[02:50:55.985 --> 02:50:58.346]  I am a fan.
[02:50:58.386 --> 02:51:06.709]  I mean, I'm religiously following what you guys put out because it's important and it all ties together.
[02:51:08.001 --> 02:51:17.926]  So, um, that, you know, and the left of today is a lot scarier than the left of, you know, 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago, because they're not the left.
[02:51:19.226 --> 02:51:25.069]  But I'm, you know, it's, it's preaching to the choir, because you do so well.
[02:51:25.089 --> 02:51:25.730]  You're a smart guy.
[02:51:26.010 --> 02:51:26.550]  What are they?
[02:51:26.570 --> 02:51:29.451]  They're more like a, like, they're more pro-war than Republicans now.
[02:51:29.491 --> 02:51:29.952]  They don't care.
[02:51:29.972 --> 02:51:30.472]  They want war.
[02:51:30.752 --> 02:51:31.832]  They're anti-free speech.
[02:51:33.033 --> 02:51:36.715]  All the so-called minority groups are now led by like people that sound like Nazis.
[02:51:37.395 --> 02:51:39.837]  I mean, they're so bad, I can't believe it.
[02:51:40.338 --> 02:51:40.838]  Oh, precisely.
[02:51:40.858 --> 02:51:46.844]  I mean, really, the birth of the left was in the approach of the Stassi-style approach that they took to Joe.
[02:51:46.864 --> 02:51:59.537]  I mean, here are people that were his supervisors who knew his honesty, knew his character, would vouch for his character, and yet felt coerced to this blackmail and this campaign to try to blacklist him and to try to literally put him in a black hole.
[02:52:00.317 --> 02:52:03.240]  So what the left is now is just media stampeding.
[02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:04.601]  It's not left, it's not right.
[02:52:04.661 --> 02:52:07.343]  It's like hysteria, witch hunts, stampeding.
[02:52:07.543 --> 02:52:08.784]  It's 1920s left.
[02:52:09.324 --> 02:52:10.705]  It's 1920s communist left.
[02:52:11.326 --> 02:52:13.167]  1920s Stasi-style left.
[02:52:13.508 --> 02:52:15.649]  1920s street violence Antifa-style left.
[02:52:16.470 --> 02:52:23.375]  When they had the black shirts and the rest who were roaming the streets with fighting people just sort of randomly targeted for political purposes.
[02:52:23.635 --> 02:52:24.196]  That's who they are.
[02:52:24.356 --> 02:52:26.097]  They're the secret police left.
[02:52:26.498 --> 02:52:27.919]  They're not the free speech left.
[02:52:27.939 --> 02:52:29.260]  They're the secret police left.
[02:52:29.580 --> 02:52:31.401]  So they're the enforcers.
[02:52:31.421 --> 02:52:35.484]  Joe, what would you quantify, Joe Bannister, at the time we're in today in the world?
[02:52:35.604 --> 02:52:36.345]  What would you call this?
[02:52:38.946 --> 02:52:39.987]  We're on the edge of a cliff.
[02:52:41.368 --> 02:52:53.797]  I'm very grateful that President Trump was elected and I think that he's not controlled in the way that presidents throughout my lifetime and certainly the lifetimes before that that I wasn't alive.
[02:52:55.033 --> 02:52:57.336]  Uh, so I'm really encouraged by what I see.
[02:52:57.356 --> 02:53:09.809]  But the thing I'm scared about most is that if President Trump is in for four or even eight years, what is, what are the, what does the opposition got planned for us when he leaves?
[02:53:09.869 --> 02:53:13.713]  And that's why I think that this issue, you know, as I try to lay out in my book,
[02:53:14.748 --> 02:53:29.507]  Why it's so critical that we follow up on the income tax and the Federal Reserve because and the cashless society and all these things because even if President Trump cleans up the swamp as much as he thinks he can in eight years, we're done for.
[02:53:30.430 --> 02:53:36.914]  When it comes to the cashless society and the way that... In fact, I wanted to bring that up when we came out from break, and I'm glad you described it.
[02:53:36.934 --> 02:53:40.617]  It's not that we're against cashless, except then it lets them turn us off.
[02:53:40.877 --> 02:53:45.420]  We're not against technology, and they're abusing tech already.
[02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:49.062]  Imagine once there's no more cash, things are all tracked.
[02:53:49.362 --> 02:53:52.084]  They're already coming after everybody's bank accounts.
[02:53:52.444 --> 02:53:53.665]  This is the total control.
[02:53:54.571 --> 02:54:09.499]  Well, as an illustration, you know, this is anecdotal, but when you're at the coffee shop and you see a 20-something paying for something with their card and then it doesn't work and they're like, you know, and then I'm in line behind them and I've got cash.
[02:54:10.871 --> 02:54:12.272]  And I walk out with my coffee.
[02:54:12.573 --> 02:54:15.475]  So it's just people have no idea.
[02:54:15.855 --> 02:54:21.841]  It takes away the options and when you're cashless, it gives total surveillance and the total push.
[02:54:22.181 --> 02:54:23.182]  You have no choice.
[02:54:23.382 --> 02:54:24.263]  Now we control you.
[02:54:24.603 --> 02:54:25.043]  Absolutely.
[02:54:25.283 --> 02:54:28.406]  So it's why, like, they perceive threats like Bitcoin.
[02:54:28.726 --> 02:54:31.589]  The cashless society they're predicting is not a Bitcoin society.
[02:54:31.909 --> 02:54:37.514]  It is a society where the banks control the information and where the banks monopolize even more and more information against you.
[02:54:37.834 --> 02:54:41.757]  So it's like when the IRS started maintaining medical records, it's going to be an extension.
[02:54:41.797 --> 02:54:44.038]  The financial system is going to know your speech records.
[02:54:44.299 --> 02:54:52.084]  There was a great book years ago that Joe cited called Confessions of a Tax Collector, where an IRS agent just details, it was almost like Lord Conrad going into the heart of the jungle.
[02:54:52.444 --> 02:54:57.368]  And what he describes is all the intimate information about an individual he can do with one little pen stroke.
[02:54:57.748 --> 02:55:03.076]  That's part of what Joe talks about in his book is that much of the tax laws have nothing to do with revenue raising whatsoever.
[02:55:03.396 --> 02:55:07.542]  They have to do with social control, political control, state surveillance.
[02:55:07.883 --> 02:55:13.390]  I was talking to somebody that works for a major director, one of the top directors, one of the top three directors.
[02:55:14.696 --> 02:55:17.278]  They kept telling the directors, their business partners, well this will make more money.
[02:55:17.338 --> 02:55:20.279]  It's not about money, it's about power and control of perception.
[02:55:20.319 --> 02:55:22.180]  We want control of our souls.
[02:55:23.281 --> 02:55:23.641]  What do you mean?
[02:55:23.661 --> 02:55:24.662]  Well, I'll tell you later.
[02:55:25.202 --> 02:55:26.423]  But that's really what this is.
[02:55:26.583 --> 02:55:29.905]  Well, think about it as the most powerful self-confessional tool in the world.
[02:55:30.905 --> 02:55:42.132]  Your tax form discloses who are your personal relationships with, who are your family members, what church do you go to, what schools are you associated with, what political causes do you care about, who can you contribute to.
[02:55:42.472 --> 02:55:47.677]  The IRS agent pointed out he could know everything about your life by just a couple of keystrokes on their computer system.
[02:55:48.097 --> 02:55:52.721]  That's why there's First Amendment issues with it, Fourth Amendment issues with it, Fifth Amendment issues with it.
[02:55:53.162 --> 02:55:53.922]  So Joe's right.
[02:55:54.022 --> 02:55:55.143]  It's the original Google.
[02:55:55.484 --> 02:55:57.105]  Absolutely.
[02:55:57.265 --> 02:55:58.827]  You're confessing to it, Joe.
[02:56:01.127 --> 02:56:01.607]  That's right.
[02:56:01.767 --> 02:56:04.868]  I've been whistling the same tune for many years.
[02:56:04.928 --> 02:56:12.030]  I mean, one of the first things you do as a special agent was to order up all the tax returns from the people that, you know, had filed.
[02:56:12.530 --> 02:56:15.451]  And you've got all this information that they voluntarily gave you.
[02:56:15.531 --> 02:56:18.092]  And I realize, you know, it's intimidation.
[02:56:18.112 --> 02:56:18.872]  It's force.
[02:56:19.913 --> 02:56:22.916]  But, you know, they've volunteered all this information to you.
[02:56:23.596 --> 02:56:27.801]  And that was back in 1993 to 1999.
[02:56:28.482 --> 02:56:30.404]  So imagine what they have today.
[02:56:30.624 --> 02:56:33.066]  And, of course, you've probably heard of FinCEN.
[02:56:33.967 --> 02:56:35.369]  Financial Crimes Enforcement.
[02:56:36.297 --> 02:56:41.984]  Yeah, have people, have your listeners Google FinCEN to see where we stand today.
[02:56:42.004 --> 02:56:43.706]  Alex, I'd like to just point out.
[02:56:43.986 --> 02:56:51.895]  They use FinCEN outside of law to just, if the Southern Primary Law Center says you're hateful, you can have an A++, no criminal record, perfect credit with banks.
[02:56:52.416 --> 02:56:56.100]  Suddenly your bank accounts, because they put in FinCEN, hate.
[02:56:57.176 --> 02:56:57.716]  Well, precisely.
[02:56:57.736 --> 02:56:59.597]  And you can add to that the Michael Avenatti story.
[02:56:59.877 --> 02:57:03.678]  So some high-ranking IRS official connected to FinCEN... By the way, you said this months ago.
[02:57:03.758 --> 02:57:04.178]  It's confirmed.
[02:57:04.198 --> 02:57:04.978]  They raided the guy.
[02:57:04.998 --> 02:57:06.398]  He gave it to Avenatti.
[02:57:06.859 --> 02:57:07.199]  Exactly.
[02:57:07.219 --> 02:57:15.021]  What happened to you is a high-ranking IRS agent was using access to FinCEN records to disclose all the private bank records of even the wrong Michael Cohen.
[02:57:15.081 --> 02:57:16.681]  And so that's the power they have.
[02:57:17.001 --> 02:57:19.802]  And so when they can leak that information, they can destroy your life overnight.
[02:57:20.102 --> 02:57:23.463]  Why are the Democratic Party obsessed with President Trump's tax returns?
[02:57:23.703 --> 02:57:25.663]  Not because they think there's anything wrong on those returns.
[02:57:25.683 --> 02:57:27.024]  They want to find out his intimates.
[02:57:27.244 --> 02:57:27.744]  Exactly.
[02:57:27.844 --> 02:57:30.924]  Every little private piece of his life over the past 20 years.
[02:57:31.224 --> 02:57:31.865]  That's what they are.
[02:57:31.905 --> 02:57:34.385]  They're the Stasi in disguise.
[02:57:34.505 --> 02:57:37.366]  And Joe's been one of the leaders at outing them for the last 20 years.
[02:57:37.426 --> 02:57:38.066]  No, Joe's right.
[02:57:38.126 --> 02:57:39.426]  It's the heart of the deep state.
[02:57:39.646 --> 02:57:39.926]  Correct.
[02:57:40.186 --> 02:57:41.106]  It's the nexus point.
[02:57:41.586 --> 02:57:43.247]  And it gives them legal cover to do it.
[02:57:43.907 --> 02:57:45.867]  Because Google and Facebook and Twitter don't have it yet.
[02:57:46.347 --> 02:57:48.428]  We'll be right back on the other side with your phone calls.
[02:57:48.808 --> 02:57:49.868]  I promise, straight ahead.
[02:57:50.068 --> 02:57:50.528]  Stay with us.

[02:58:51.553 --> 02:58:56.136]  I want to fight them and not run around trying to make money to fund the operation.

[02:59:56.332 --> 03:00:05.934]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:07.975 --> 03:00:11.315]  Let me tell you how it will be.
[03:00:14.956 --> 03:00:18.017]  There's one for you, nineteen for me.
[03:00:32.271 --> 03:00:41.880]  Look at these headlines.
[03:00:41.980 --> 03:00:42.561]  AP News.
[03:00:42.721 --> 03:00:43.361]  Trump Jr.
[03:00:43.401 --> 03:00:46.645]  Feds Using Stalinist Tactics Against His Family.
[03:00:47.505 --> 03:00:48.306]  They absolutely are.
[03:00:48.627 --> 03:00:55.874]  There's a story on Infowars.com where there's a nice lady, a pastry maker, that's worked at Mar-a-Lago for years.
[03:00:57.304 --> 03:00:59.085]  And they found out that she's a Trump supporter.
[03:00:59.745 --> 03:01:01.707]  And they found out that she's in a QAnon conspiracy.
[03:01:01.727 --> 03:01:02.447]  Well, that's her right.
[03:01:02.787 --> 03:01:03.968]  So now they want her fired.
[03:01:03.988 --> 03:01:05.869]  I mean, that's the level.
[03:01:05.929 --> 03:01:16.115]  So Joe Bannister, it seems like they're just conditioning us to be persecuted and bullied by big tech, the IRS, and the rest of it.
[03:01:17.516 --> 03:01:19.437]  Yeah, including the President of the United States.
[03:01:19.617 --> 03:01:22.379]  And that's why I'd like to take this opportunity to
[03:01:23.226 --> 03:01:30.588]  Just let President Trump know that I know at least a couple dozen attorneys and experts.
[03:01:30.988 --> 03:01:35.189]  Hold on, I'm not interrupting you, but let's take a call because I want to drumbeat this up.
[03:01:35.469 --> 03:01:41.291]  Your message to the President, former Treasury agent, great patriot, found not guilty in two show trials.
[03:01:41.691 --> 03:01:44.552]  When we come back from break, it'll be your message to the President.
[03:01:44.572 --> 03:01:46.912]  I have a sneaking suspicion we might be able to get it to him.
[03:01:47.212 --> 03:01:48.653]  Carlos in Montreal, Canada.
[03:01:48.673 --> 03:01:49.153]  You're on the air.
[03:01:49.193 --> 03:01:49.453]  Go ahead.
[03:01:50.489 --> 03:01:51.249]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:01:51.510 --> 03:01:52.370]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:01:52.470 --> 03:01:54.671]  It dovetails perfectly with what I was going to say.
[03:01:55.792 --> 03:02:05.077]  The Federal Reserve is effectively taking out $500 billion, as it did last year, from the currency, from liquidity.
[03:02:05.737 --> 03:02:06.497]  It's not helping.
[03:02:07.118 --> 03:02:09.519]  It was an instrument in 1913 that introduced
[03:02:12.304 --> 03:02:12.625]  Thank you.
[03:02:27.799 --> 03:02:42.970]  When the people revolted against the central banking, making a few oligarchs very wealthy, whitish in color because they were European with credit, well the ones who were Indians were left behind, you know, to mend the environment that they were destroying in the oil industry.
[03:02:43.430 --> 03:02:44.371]  And when you look at
[03:02:45.254 --> 03:02:51.618]  The, what I call the Chavez revolt, the rebellion of Chavez, is coming to the United States, because it's the same principle.
[03:02:51.858 --> 03:02:55.400]  You have a bunch of oligarchs, and the rest of the people are left behind.
[03:02:55.640 --> 03:02:57.861]  They are left behind with very little wealth.
[03:02:58.422 --> 03:03:04.325]  And when you have this imbalance in the few and the many, what happens is you have the Robin Hood candidates.
[03:03:04.645 --> 03:03:14.751]  You have candidates like Chavez, who come out of basically a bus driver, like Maduro, you know, who basically come forward and offer the public, you know, free this, free that, free that, because it is
[03:03:15.450 --> 03:03:17.631]  Taxation without representation, effectively.
[03:03:18.031 --> 03:03:20.333]  So what the founding fathers... Exactly!
[03:03:20.373 --> 03:03:31.719]  We better offer real jobs and real capitalism, because either fascism or communism or socialism will produce a bunch of AOCs coming in, promising people free lunches, and then this nightmare starts.
[03:03:33.413 --> 03:03:38.499]  And there's a number one, Robin Hood, and number two is the elements that follow.
[03:03:38.799 --> 03:03:46.607]  And you know, by telling blacks that you're going to give them reparations for the very many years of slavery, basically you're doing what Chavez was saying to the poor.
[03:03:46.788 --> 03:03:49.350]  Hey, forever reparations for many years of poverty.
[03:03:49.651 --> 03:03:54.456]  You know, vote for me and you will have Robin Hood candidate and, you know, the world's an oyster.
[03:03:55.009 --> 03:04:05.358]  And of course, those who were with credit, who had oil companies that they invested in, those people were saying, hey, hey, listen, we put our money, our work, and everything, but what did these people with no credit?
[03:04:05.899 --> 03:04:11.424]  You see, the Federal Reserve creates people with credit and gives them, you know, eternal money.
[03:04:11.826 --> 03:04:16.189]  But the people with no credit, obviously the bankers, bankerism doesn't give poor people money.
[03:04:16.689 --> 03:04:20.432]  So what happens is that effectively, the poor get poorer and the rich get richer.
[03:04:20.612 --> 03:04:22.213]  Any new money... No, exactly.
[03:04:22.233 --> 03:04:26.716]  It's a predatory system where they promise them pie in the sky, and they use the fact that...
[03:04:27.748 --> 03:04:30.391]  Real free market folks don't recognize this and block it to take over.
[03:04:30.751 --> 03:04:31.872]  Carlos, amazing points.
[03:04:31.892 --> 03:04:43.344]  We're going to come back, and we're going to have Joe Bannister's message to the President, and then I want to get your message to the President, because a lot of these messages to the President, they love it when we say this, it somehow gets to Trump.
[03:04:43.945 --> 03:04:49.771]  So we'll have Joe give a three-minute message to the President, we'll have you give one, and we'll take a few calls straight ahead.
[03:04:50.231 --> 03:04:53.515]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:04:53.575 --> 03:04:55.517]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[03:04:56.138 --> 03:04:59.761]  What is it about this broadcast they fight so hard to shut it down?
[03:05:12.012 --> 03:05:13.574]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[03:05:14.055 --> 03:05:15.316]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:05:15.396 --> 03:05:17.138]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:05:17.218 --> 03:05:19.541]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:05:19.701 --> 03:05:21.243]  Brain, body, heart.
[03:05:21.323 --> 03:05:22.724]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[03:05:22.784 --> 03:05:24.006]  You've got the children's.
[03:05:24.166 --> 03:05:25.127]  You've got the adults.
[03:05:25.287 --> 03:05:26.168]  You've got the krill oil.
[03:05:26.288 --> 03:05:29.652]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[03:05:29.672 --> 03:05:32.035]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[03:05:32.395 --> 03:05:34.276]  It'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry.
[03:05:34.336 --> 03:05:35.356]  You want something like this?
[03:05:35.436 --> 03:05:36.316]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:05:36.416 --> 03:05:38.277]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:05:38.337 --> 03:05:39.477]  It's so good, in my view.
[03:05:39.557 --> 03:05:41.758]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:05:41.778 --> 03:05:46.219]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:05:47.980 --> 03:05:52.541]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:05:55.492 --> 03:06:01.298]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:06:01.398 --> 03:06:02.319]  I just can't do it!
[03:06:09.727 --> 03:06:11.749]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:12.109 --> 03:06:13.431]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:27.093 --> 03:06:29.535]  We're good to go.
[03:06:54.500 --> 03:06:56.982]  Robert Barnes and Joe Bannister, our guests, coming up.
[03:06:58.042 --> 03:06:59.403]  Owen Benjamin takes over.
[03:06:59.944 --> 03:07:11.751]  Had a bunch of calls to get to him, trying my best to get to him, but Joe Bannister, former Treasury agent, whistleblower, tried to put him in prison twice for his free speech about the private Federal Reserve and the IRS corruption.
[03:07:12.212 --> 03:07:14.873]  He's here and he's got a message to President Trump.
[03:07:14.893 --> 03:07:16.935]  So Joe, give President Trump that message.
[03:07:18.973 --> 03:07:24.558]  Well, I feel a little awkward in thinking that any message that I could give would be worthy of the president's ears.
[03:07:24.659 --> 03:07:26.160]  But here goes.
[03:07:26.741 --> 03:07:35.189]  I just hope that President Trump realizes that he's done amazing things, but please don't leave us with a leaky lifeboat.
[03:07:36.093 --> 03:07:45.619]  When you finally have to leave office, please build us a battleship so that we can continue the fight and I can.
[03:07:45.999 --> 03:07:53.543]  I know of at least a couple dozen attorneys and experts who can show him where all the bodies are buried at the IRS.
[03:07:54.644 --> 03:07:57.306]  So just would love the opportunity.
[03:07:57.326 --> 03:08:02.569]  I know he's got a long priority list and that's my that's my short and sweet message.
[03:08:03.604 --> 03:08:06.366]  But I mean, specifically, Loris Lerner got caught.
[03:08:07.387 --> 03:08:10.148]  MSNBC and others bragged, oh yeah, we're targeting conservatives.
[03:08:10.669 --> 03:08:12.870]  This is way beyond anything Nixon ever dreamed of.
[03:08:12.890 --> 03:08:17.033]  So I think one of Trump's biggest failures is not going after the IRS.
[03:08:17.713 --> 03:08:21.475]  And I know he's got a lot of things going on, but... Oh, absolutely.
[03:08:21.495 --> 03:08:28.120]  And one of the things he has to do is not have the IRS allowed to be able to control people's medical records.
[03:08:28.780 --> 03:08:34.044]  So years ago I brought one of the biggest class actions in the country that disclosed that the IRS was gathering people's medical records.
[03:08:34.525 --> 03:08:37.567]  Over 60 million medical records of over 10 million Americans.
[03:08:37.927 --> 03:08:45.333]  This included medical records of judges, baseball players, the Screen Actors Guild, the Directors Guild, some of the most high-profile people in the country.
[03:08:45.353 --> 03:08:48.656]  So they know if you've got HIV, they know if you've got a heart problem.
[03:08:49.196 --> 03:08:50.997]  They know if your kid's in drug rehab.
[03:08:51.277 --> 03:08:53.219]  They know if your wife has a certain issue.
[03:08:53.459 --> 03:08:56.240]  They know if you're a baseball player you have an undisclosed medical ailment.
[03:08:56.461 --> 03:09:02.904]  Or maybe you're a prominent Hollywood actor who has medical conditions that would make you unbondable for films and thus uncastable.
[03:09:03.245 --> 03:09:10.149]  So they know, I mean, it would be Hoover's wet dream of a black male file is what the IRS is gathering on every single... And Obama did that how many years ago?
[03:09:11.269 --> 03:09:12.229]  It started eight years ago.
[03:09:12.569 --> 03:09:16.931]  And so what Joe is talking about... I mean, how in the world do they get away with the IRS?
[03:09:16.951 --> 03:09:17.471]  I remember that.
[03:09:17.851 --> 03:09:19.611]  Oh, the IRS is now over your medical records.
[03:09:19.791 --> 03:09:20.031]  What?
[03:09:20.331 --> 03:09:20.711]  Exactly.
[03:09:20.731 --> 03:09:24.912]  I mean, in my suit, they folded completely because they didn't want it to go to trial.
[03:09:25.172 --> 03:09:29.333]  So they deleted all records, destroyed all records, made certain specific promises to my clients.
[03:09:29.673 --> 03:09:31.614]  But that doesn't mean they're not doing it to everybody else.
[03:09:31.954 --> 03:09:35.018]  And so what Joe's talking about is critical, necessary, and essential.
[03:09:35.439 --> 03:09:38.743]  And Joe's been in the leader of that and has taken a lot of hits for that.
[03:09:39.143 --> 03:09:47.093]  So that's why, you know, I think people supporting Joe is critical and essential because he's been a sacrificial lamb and a martyr for a cause that mostly benefits all the rest of us.
[03:09:47.614 --> 03:09:48.094]  Well, you're right.
[03:09:48.134 --> 03:09:55.940]  He was a patient zero because that was one of the first times, oh, we're going to indict you because you're a former Treasury agent doing radio interviews.
[03:09:55.960 --> 03:09:58.822]  It was like in the indictment, saying that it could be a fraud.
[03:09:59.223 --> 03:09:59.603]  Absolutely.
[03:09:59.823 --> 03:10:12.153]  And what happened in that case was Joe was indicted for using the IRS's own rules, the IRS's own procedures, the IRS's own protocols, following them to a T, even filed a special form that red flagged the position he was taking.
[03:10:12.473 --> 03:10:14.815]  So he just wanted an honest answer for his client.
[03:10:14.835 --> 03:10:15.155]  That's it.
[03:10:15.655 --> 03:10:17.877]  Which used to be the American way of advocacy.
[03:10:17.897 --> 03:10:22.100]  Well, it's like, meanwhile, Smollett just got caught staging all this, Joe.
[03:10:22.140 --> 03:10:23.181]  We have all these false flags.
[03:10:23.601 --> 03:10:25.823]  They lie and say that I ever said it was completely fake.
[03:10:25.863 --> 03:10:26.563]  I looked at both sides.
[03:10:26.944 --> 03:10:28.585]  I have a right to say Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[03:10:28.865 --> 03:10:31.407]  Later I looked at Anomaly and said, yes, mass shootings probably happened.
[03:10:31.787 --> 03:10:39.493]  The point is, is their idea is to take me off the air because I questioned it, which they admit they want to get rid of New York Times versus Sullivan and end the First Amendment.
[03:10:39.833 --> 03:10:44.257]  Clarence Thomas, God bless him, wrote a big piece last week saying get rid of the First Amendment, basically.
[03:10:44.637 --> 03:10:45.137]  Oh, exactly.
[03:10:45.157 --> 03:10:47.499]  And it's designed to suppress independent speech.
[03:10:47.779 --> 03:10:50.041]  They never expected Donald Trump to get elected.
[03:10:50.281 --> 03:10:56.706]  They now realize the true scope and pervasiveness of the power of independent, honest voices like Joe.
[03:10:56.726 --> 03:10:58.107]  Well, let me raise that to Joe.
[03:10:58.487 --> 03:10:59.949]  How big is it, though, that...
[03:11:00.851 --> 03:11:05.452]  Most of the women have admitted they made up the sexual assaults on Kavanaugh.
[03:11:06.472 --> 03:11:07.932]  The Covington kids, that was staged.
[03:11:08.413 --> 03:11:09.233]  Smollett staged.
[03:11:09.293 --> 03:11:10.473]  People are really getting now.
[03:11:10.753 --> 03:11:12.073]  I get a lot of apologies in the street.
[03:11:12.133 --> 03:11:14.154]  Wow, I see why you question things.
[03:11:14.614 --> 03:11:16.114]  And now we burst broke last week.
[03:11:16.134 --> 03:11:19.875]  The FBI is looking at people handling Smollett, telling him what to say.
[03:11:20.335 --> 03:11:24.816]  Now it's come out that the heads of the show had put out scripts.
[03:11:25.356 --> 03:11:29.197]  Well, as I say on my website, you know, a lie needs another lie in order to stand, but the truth stands by itself.
[03:11:53.508 --> 03:12:00.012]  And, of course, the paper trail always kills these liars and their lies.
[03:12:00.393 --> 03:12:04.475]  And so, I just encourage people to learn how to follow the paper trail.
[03:12:05.076 --> 03:12:07.757]  The best place to get that education is Infowars.com.
[03:12:07.797 --> 03:12:08.358]  No, no, no.
[03:12:08.778 --> 03:12:11.380]  How do people, because your website's awesome, but it's got a long URL and a short one.
[03:12:11.700 --> 03:12:13.701]  How do people best find your website and find the book?
[03:12:13.941 --> 03:12:14.602]  They can buy it from me.
[03:12:14.622 --> 03:12:15.182]  They should buy it from you.
[03:12:15.202 --> 03:12:15.883]  I don't carry it away.
[03:12:16.203 --> 03:12:17.504]  How do people find your great work, Joe?
[03:12:18.893 --> 03:12:24.355]  Agentfortruth.com, what's that all about, is a great section to get started on.
[03:12:24.555 --> 03:12:27.516]  Agentfortruth.com, but you just hit a key point there.
[03:12:30.658 --> 03:12:38.781]  Why does the establishment, because I always watch old movies where the villain brags, and I think that's dumb, but it's true in criminology.
[03:12:38.861 --> 03:12:44.703]  Villains love to tell you what they've done, they love to brag about it, and look at the globalists, they've told us everything they're doing, Joe.
[03:12:45.973 --> 03:12:54.157]  Well, and as I mentioned before, you know, our founders put together an amazing framework unseen in human history.
[03:12:54.877 --> 03:12:59.979]  And so there are things like the Freedom of Information Act and our own constitutional protections.
[03:12:59.999 --> 03:13:10.224]  I mean, I lament about how corrupt our government is, but if it wasn't for my right to a jury trial, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, I would have spent quite a few years in club fed.
[03:13:10.304 --> 03:13:11.825]  So we do still have rights.
[03:13:12.792 --> 03:13:16.475]  We just need to exercise them as frequently as possible.
[03:13:16.795 --> 03:13:20.238]  How pissed were they when they didn't get the convictions?
[03:13:20.258 --> 03:13:21.439]  You were tried twice, right?
[03:13:23.180 --> 03:13:30.486]  The second one was a criminal investigation that they terminated, which there's more information about that in the Investigating the Federal Income Tax book.
[03:13:31.767 --> 03:13:34.629]  But yeah, it's been non-stop.
[03:13:34.689 --> 03:13:37.352]  Just kind of another full-time job for me.
[03:13:38.399 --> 03:13:43.422]  You know, again, the truth, the truth always comes out and deceivers get found out.
[03:13:43.782 --> 03:13:48.805]  And so it's my position that the IRS and the DOJ are deceivers.
[03:13:49.225 --> 03:13:50.746]  And people say that I am.
[03:13:50.906 --> 03:13:52.947]  And I just invite people to look at both.
[03:13:53.688 --> 03:14:04.674]  Don't forget, Alex, that America... Why would you throw away your career that was rising just to challenge all this unless you... Don't forget that America, freedom to fascism is a great educational tool.
[03:14:04.714 --> 03:14:05.174]  Right, Alex?
[03:14:06.573 --> 03:14:07.794]  You did a great job in that film.
[03:14:07.814 --> 03:14:10.016]  Well, Joe, come back soon, in the next few weeks.
[03:14:10.417 --> 03:14:13.620]  Do a whole hour and take calls on the IRS and what's happening.
[03:14:13.660 --> 03:14:14.201]  God bless you.
[03:14:14.241 --> 03:14:17.104]  The book is available at agentfortruth.com.
[03:14:17.124 --> 03:14:18.405]  We have it at infowarsstore.com.
[03:14:18.725 --> 03:14:20.867]  Investigating the Federal Income Tax.
[03:14:20.887 --> 03:14:22.088]  It reports the American people.
[03:14:22.449 --> 03:14:25.432]  Joseph R. Bannister, former IRS Special Agent.
[03:14:25.472 --> 03:14:25.952]  God bless you.
[03:14:26.813 --> 03:14:27.334]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:14:29.144 --> 03:14:47.450]  We've got a really smart, funny guy, Owen Benjamin, about to take over, but I promised I'd take all these calls, and Owen knows sometimes that I'll preempt when he's on, but I just, a few of these calls, I can't get to everybody, but my gosh, Josh has been holding for almost two hours, and so has Grant, so I'm sure Owen Benjamin's gonna be okay.
[03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:50.631]  We're gonna come back, hit two calls with you, then throw it to him.
[03:14:50.971 --> 03:14:54.812]  Everybody else, I apologize, I can't get to you, Mitchell and Freedom Fighter.
[03:14:54.832 --> 03:14:56.553]  The problem is, we have like 20 phone lines.
[03:14:57.333 --> 03:15:00.476]  So we take like 10 calls, the rest fill up, and I always feel bad hanging up on him.
[03:15:01.036 --> 03:15:01.716]  So it's kind of a catch-22.
[03:15:01.776 --> 03:15:06.120]  But we'll hit two of those, and then Owen Benjamin is going to take over.
[03:15:06.500 --> 03:15:07.401]  Huge pianist.
[03:15:08.061 --> 03:15:08.942]  That means piano.
[03:15:09.282 --> 03:15:09.923]  Huge pianist.
[03:15:09.943 --> 03:15:10.643]  He's like 6'8".
[03:15:12.825 --> 03:15:13.846]  He's almost as tall as I am.
[03:15:14.326 --> 03:15:14.806]  I'm joking.
[03:15:15.147 --> 03:15:16.888]  He's almost as tall as our friend in Connecticut.
[03:15:17.228 --> 03:15:18.830]  So that's all coming up.
[03:15:18.850 --> 03:15:25.034]  But just listening to Joe, Robert Barnes, turning it law, it's just crazy that he barely survived.
[03:15:25.154 --> 03:15:25.835]  The guy did nothing.
[03:15:26.195 --> 03:15:26.735]  Absolutely.
[03:15:26.755 --> 03:15:34.119]  I mean, this was one of the most honest, one of the most sincere people that I've ever met in my entire 20 years of doing this kind of legal work and these kind of cases.
[03:15:34.539 --> 03:15:36.840]  He's an extraordinary human being, a generous human being.
[03:15:37.381 --> 03:15:38.501]  He was generous with his time.
[03:15:38.541 --> 03:15:41.523]  He was generous with the risk he took for everybody else's freedom and liberty.
[03:15:41.923 --> 03:15:45.505]  He did so for their freedom and their liberty because he's one of the last true patriots.
[03:15:45.825 --> 03:15:52.088]  Most of his family members are law enforcement, they're fire department guys, they're police officers.
[03:15:52.389 --> 03:15:59.832]  He believed in the American Dream and he still believed in the American Dream even when the corrupt actors in our politicized system of justice tried to crush that American Dream.
[03:15:59.852 --> 03:16:00.593]  That's right, we'll be back.
[03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:08.093]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[03:18:12.096 --> 03:18:20.481]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:18:21.081 --> 03:18:30.946]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:18:31.186 --> 03:18:39.711]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:18:40.572 --> 03:18:41.513]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:18:41.893 --> 03:18:42.934]  You must experience it.

[03:18:45.015 --> 03:18:49.379]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:18:50.059 --> 03:18:51.500]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:18:51.580 --> 03:18:52.561]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[03:18:53.041 --> 03:18:59.186]  So take a half packet the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:18:59.746 --> 03:19:01.488]  TurboForce at MForceLife.com.
[03:19:03.649 --> 03:19:05.030]  I want to say BrainForce is great.
[03:19:05.090 --> 03:19:06.872]  I want to say TurboForce is amazing.
[03:19:07.012 --> 03:19:07.432]  It is.
[03:19:07.612 --> 03:19:09.193]  But if you took it with fish oil,
[03:19:10.425 --> 03:19:11.986]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[03:19:12.466 --> 03:19:13.726]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:19:13.806 --> 03:19:15.567]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:19:15.627 --> 03:19:17.948]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:19:18.108 --> 03:19:19.668]  Brain, body, heart.
[03:19:19.748 --> 03:19:21.149]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[03:19:21.209 --> 03:19:22.429]  You've got the children's.
[03:19:22.569 --> 03:19:23.550]  You've got the adults.
[03:19:23.670 --> 03:19:24.590]  You've got the krill oil.
[03:19:24.690 --> 03:19:26.971]  If you're gonna get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's
[03:19:26.971 --> 03:19:31.875]  Children's are really strong, they don't give you the burpees, but krill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:19:32.015 --> 03:19:34.737]  And I'm sorry, if you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[03:19:34.837 --> 03:19:37.920]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[03:19:37.980 --> 03:19:40.182]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:19:40.202 --> 03:19:44.645]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:19:46.407 --> 03:19:50.971]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:19:53.919 --> 03:19:59.885]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:19:59.945 --> 03:20:00.726]  I just can't do it!
[03:20:06.752 --> 03:20:09.355]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.563 --> 03:20:27.747]  Well, one of my favorite comedians and talk show host Owen Benjamin is about to take over, and I apologize for hijacking some of his time, but he's welcome anytime to come to host.
[03:20:28.067 --> 03:20:30.708]  He's coming up in just a few minutes, but I promised Josh and Grant.
[03:20:31.108 --> 03:20:32.209]  Yeah, there's Owen Benjamin right there.
[03:20:32.649 --> 03:20:35.351]  I promised Grant and Josh we'd go to him.
[03:20:35.391 --> 03:20:36.951]  So Josh in Indiana, go ahead.
[03:20:37.332 --> 03:20:38.972]  You're on the air with Alex Jones and Robert Barnes.
[03:20:40.033 --> 03:20:41.854]  Alex Jones of the modern day.
[03:20:42.154 --> 03:20:42.894]  Paul Revere.
[03:20:42.954 --> 03:20:44.375]  What an honor to speak with you, sir.
[03:20:44.655 --> 03:20:46.776]  Honor to take to you, and thanks for holding so long.
[03:20:47.797 --> 03:20:49.678]  Well, I called in about Venezuela.
[03:20:50.683 --> 03:20:52.765]  And I don't agree about getting involved in it.
[03:20:55.627 --> 03:21:06.816]  As you guys clearly pointed out, I think with Mr. Bannister and Mr. Barnes, we got to help you.
[03:21:07.916 --> 03:21:13.921]  We got to get together and, you know, support InfoWars.
[03:21:15.222 --> 03:21:18.665]  I mean, you're bringing all this for everybody to listen to.
[03:21:19.705 --> 03:21:24.731]  It just hurts my heart to see all this evil in the world.
[03:21:26.485 --> 03:21:28.166]  We've got to support him for worse.
[03:21:28.646 --> 03:21:31.728]  Well, I appreciate you, but you know if we weren't effective they wouldn't be trying that.
[03:21:31.748 --> 03:21:32.388]  No, I hear you.
[03:21:32.848 --> 03:21:37.711]  I don't like Maduro or what's happening, but I don't trust the neocons and our own government to not make it worse.
[03:21:38.071 --> 03:21:38.531]  Oh, precisely.
[03:21:38.551 --> 03:21:41.873]  There's just a long history of our direct involvement contaminating things.
[03:21:41.893 --> 03:21:53.779]  There's already people on the ground who believe that in fact Maduro's gotten a second life because of our such public affiliation with challenging him where he was probably... Well, one argument is they sold us out of the World Bank and that we're really propping Maduro up.
[03:21:54.019 --> 03:21:54.559]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:21:54.579 --> 03:21:55.680]  There's that problem as well.
[03:21:55.720 --> 03:21:58.121]  And then there's the issues of doubts about his supposed replacement.
[03:21:58.582 --> 03:21:59.622]  So there's a lot of issues.
[03:21:59.642 --> 03:22:07.586]  I think the less direct... Let the people of Venezuela, and give them the support necessary, but only let the people of Venezuela make their own decision to determine their own future.
[03:22:07.947 --> 03:22:09.908]  But what do we do about Russians and Chinese coming in?
[03:22:09.928 --> 03:22:10.628]  I don't like that either.
[03:22:10.768 --> 03:22:12.869]  Well, but what that really does is it elevates.
[03:22:13.170 --> 03:22:17.793]  They are a proxy for China and there's a whole lot of problems with Venezuela independent of their economic collapse.
[03:22:18.593 --> 03:22:22.216]  But the other part of that is do we want to escalate conflict with Russia?
[03:22:22.556 --> 03:22:31.902]  This is where Mueller's bogus probe and the media's manic conspiracy theory fantasy of Russia collusion delusion has led to major problems.
[03:22:32.143 --> 03:22:33.884]  Because Trump has escalated stuff with Russia.
[03:22:34.164 --> 03:22:34.424]  Correct.
[03:22:34.464 --> 03:22:36.026]  It's a show he's not a ruski.
[03:22:36.086 --> 03:22:36.666]  It's crazy.
[03:22:37.367 --> 03:22:38.207]  That's what I'm concerned about.
[03:22:38.227 --> 03:22:39.869]  But Josh, thanks for the support.
[03:22:39.889 --> 03:22:40.349]  God bless you.
[03:22:40.389 --> 03:22:42.811]  But you did have something to say about Venezuela.
[03:22:42.891 --> 03:22:43.432]  Oh, he's gone.
[03:22:43.512 --> 03:22:43.992]  God bless you.
[03:22:44.453 --> 03:22:45.314]  I wanted to hear what he had to say.
[03:22:45.394 --> 03:22:50.378]  Grant, real quick, and then Owen Benjamin, who is a very famous comedian.
[03:22:50.418 --> 03:22:51.479]  He's also a little person.
[03:22:52.700 --> 03:22:54.681]  Like Hank Johnson says, you don't call him midgets.
[03:22:55.122 --> 03:22:56.003]  He's a little person.
[03:22:56.383 --> 03:22:57.104]  He's two foot four.
[03:22:58.064 --> 03:22:59.546]  But he's got the heart of a lion.
[03:23:00.455 --> 03:23:03.837]  That's why he always has a fisheye lens very close to his face to look big.
[03:23:04.837 --> 03:23:05.998]  He's a little jealous of my height.
[03:23:06.218 --> 03:23:06.838]  I'm 5'2".
[03:23:07.978 --> 03:23:08.819]  He's a little jealous.
[03:23:08.899 --> 03:23:10.540]  Owen's taking over.
[03:23:11.660 --> 03:23:12.861]  Owen, I'm sorry to bring up your height.
[03:23:12.961 --> 03:23:13.541]  I apologize.
[03:23:13.881 --> 03:23:14.541]  Real fast though.
[03:23:14.581 --> 03:23:15.302]  Grant from Iowa.
[03:23:15.342 --> 03:23:15.802]  You're on the air.
[03:23:15.842 --> 03:23:16.102]  Go ahead.
[03:23:16.122 --> 03:23:16.602]  Last caller.
[03:23:17.923 --> 03:23:18.783]  Grant from Iowa.
[03:23:18.823 --> 03:23:19.103]  Yeah.
[03:23:19.123 --> 03:23:22.205]  You guys have traversed a plethora of topics since I called in.
[03:23:23.305 --> 03:23:30.271]  Pretty crazy timing with Putin issuing the nuclear threats while Maduro is supposedly burning trucks of aid.
[03:23:30.492 --> 03:23:34.175]  And then the other thing I wanted to throw in is the North Koreans.
[03:23:34.655 --> 03:23:44.084]  You guys had the story on the North Koreans denouncing the Democrats for trying to sabotage the peace talks, which is kind of crazy when you've got a communist North Koreans
[03:23:44.910 --> 03:23:48.432]  Even siding against the far-left Democrat Party in America.
[03:23:48.472 --> 03:23:49.693]  By the way, I meant Sunday.
[03:23:49.733 --> 03:23:50.653]  That'd be my lead story.
[03:23:50.693 --> 03:23:52.294]  Like, Twilight Zone is here.
[03:23:52.714 --> 03:23:54.195]  North Korea decries the Democrats.
[03:23:54.615 --> 03:23:54.995]  Exactly.
[03:23:55.216 --> 03:23:55.556]  Amazing.
[03:23:55.736 --> 03:24:01.099]  I mean, here you have the President of the United States trying to achieve the greatest peace involving the greatest nuclear threat in the modern world today.
[03:24:01.499 --> 03:24:02.099]  And what's happening?
[03:24:02.119 --> 03:24:05.541]  The Democratic Party, the purported peace party, is the one trying to undermine it.
[03:24:05.621 --> 03:24:09.343]  Now, if you study the Democratic Party historically, the Democratic Party is the war party.
[03:24:09.403 --> 03:24:11.384]  To quote old Bob Dole back in the 19th century.
[03:24:11.404 --> 03:24:12.005]  KKK.
[03:24:12.145 --> 03:24:12.485]  Exactly.
[03:24:12.745 --> 03:24:13.525]  Yeah, you go all the way back.
[03:24:13.565 --> 03:24:15.306]  Almost every war was started by a Democrat.
[03:24:15.346 --> 03:24:16.386]  It was often someone else.
[03:24:16.446 --> 03:24:24.689]  It wasn't a Democrat who stopped Vietnam, who ended World War... It was the Democrats who got us into World War I, World War II, Korea.
[03:24:24.709 --> 03:24:26.570]  They were over the Civil Rights Act anyway, exactly.
[03:24:26.610 --> 03:24:29.270]  So Koreans denouncing Democrats, what do you make of that?
[03:24:31.211 --> 03:24:33.872]  I mean, it's just, like you said, it's an upside-down world.
[03:24:34.112 --> 03:24:35.973]  It just goes along with everything else.
[03:24:36.053 --> 03:24:36.893]  It's backwards right now.
[03:24:37.557 --> 03:24:44.840]  The other thing I wanted to point out that you might have missed this weekend, Jesse Watters nominated you for the Best Fight with Little Bath House Marco there.
[03:24:45.500 --> 03:24:46.500]  I thought that was pretty hilarious.
[03:24:46.580 --> 03:24:48.361]  I was cheering you on, but they gave it to Trump.
[03:24:48.921 --> 03:24:50.222]  He gave the award to Trump.
[03:24:50.922 --> 03:24:52.923]  Oh, I missed Fox News.
[03:24:52.943 --> 03:24:55.544]  What did Jesse Watters say?
[03:24:55.604 --> 03:25:00.486]  He just did like a little Watters Award, you know, version of the Emmys for political Emmys.
[03:25:01.026 --> 03:25:06.488]  He nominated you for Best Fight, but he gave it to Trump with the Costa thing.
[03:25:07.529 --> 03:25:08.790]  No, I think Trump deserves it.
[03:25:08.850 --> 03:25:10.091]  I didn't know about that, but we'll do it.
[03:25:10.451 --> 03:25:11.172]  God bless you, Grant.
[03:25:11.212 --> 03:25:11.832]  Thanks for holding.
[03:25:12.233 --> 03:25:22.301]  I apologize to Owen Benjamin and even mentioning Kim Jong-un in front of him, because Kim Jong-un is like twice as tall as Owen Benjamin, so Owen gets really upset about that.
[03:25:23.101 --> 03:25:25.103]  So, I'm being sarcastic.
[03:25:25.623 --> 03:25:27.045]  Hey, Owen, thank you for being here.
[03:25:27.085 --> 03:25:27.885]  Tell us what's coming up.
[03:25:28.726 --> 03:25:31.108]  Well, we prefer to be called People McNuggets.
[03:25:32.561 --> 03:25:34.623]  So that's actually the PC term.
[03:25:34.883 --> 03:25:38.687]  Yeah, we're going to talk about the Oscars and why I didn't watch them.
[03:25:38.727 --> 03:25:42.370]  We're going to talk about UFC being potentially homoerotic.
[03:25:42.390 --> 03:25:44.932]  We're going to talk about vampires, all kinds of stuff.
[03:25:44.952 --> 03:25:45.733]  It's going to be a blast.
[03:25:46.113 --> 03:25:46.294]  All right.
[03:25:46.334 --> 03:25:48.035]  Take over, my friend, and thanks for being here with us.
[03:25:48.055 --> 03:25:49.276]  Thanks for having me.
[03:25:51.218 --> 03:25:52.159]  What's up, everybody?
[03:25:52.179 --> 03:25:52.880]  Hi.
[03:25:53.120 --> 03:25:57.544]  I'm honored to be guest hosting this hour of the Alex Jones.
[03:25:59.268 --> 03:26:07.173]  Uh, show and last night with the Oscars and everyone was asking me if I was going to live stream the Oscars and make fun of the Oscars and stuff.
[03:26:07.313 --> 03:26:11.176]  And I don't watch the Oscars because the Oscars are lame.
[03:26:11.976 --> 03:26:13.897]  I think that, uh, don't get me wrong.
[03:26:13.938 --> 03:26:24.124]  I've been a part of that many times where I have, uh, live stream something or just tweeted before I got kicked off Twitter permanently for being hilarious.
[03:26:25.425 --> 03:26:25.525]  Um,
[03:26:26.756 --> 03:26:28.637]  And I realized I was still engaging in it.
[03:26:29.137 --> 03:26:47.104]  And this is something that I'd like you guys to write to me or talk amongst yourselves on what you think, because as a comedian, I feel like sometimes when I mock something that I know I hate, that isn't gonna change, I'm still engaging in it for long periods of time.
[03:26:47.184 --> 03:26:55.807]  I think watching the Oscars and making fun of it at this point is almost like watching gay porn to mock it.
[03:26:56.886 --> 03:26:58.948]  It's like, oh, look at how gay these guys are.
[03:26:58.968 --> 03:27:00.669]  Oh, look at them.
[03:27:00.709 --> 03:27:02.511]  They're still being gay.
[03:27:02.531 --> 03:27:04.573]  Oh, how disgusting.
[03:27:04.613 --> 03:27:05.854]  Another guy's joining in.
[03:27:05.874 --> 03:27:09.757]  Oh, look, two hours deep and they're still being gay.
[03:27:09.837 --> 03:27:11.259]  How gross is that?
[03:27:12.059 --> 03:27:13.321]  They're so bad.
[03:27:13.761 --> 03:27:20.046]  And Hollywood, I used to be an actor in Hollywood and a comedian in Hollywood, and I was on a sitcom for three years.
[03:27:20.066 --> 03:27:21.688]  I've been in a bunch of Adam Sandler movies.
[03:27:21.828 --> 03:27:22.849]  Adam Sandler's a great guy.
[03:27:24.864 --> 03:27:29.870]  Some Comedy Central specials have done, you know, Leno and Fallon and all those shows.
[03:27:29.970 --> 03:27:32.573]  So I know that I know what that is.
[03:27:33.734 --> 03:27:37.999]  And somewhere along the way, I guess it's always been this way, but I didn't see it at the time.
[03:27:38.019 --> 03:27:43.406]  I think a lot of us have probably come to these realizations because of just the tightening of the screws.
[03:27:44.415 --> 03:27:55.862]  But it's gotten intolerable to the point where every single speech is just like, I'm here today to stand up for the people that were oppressed by the white man.
[03:27:56.882 --> 03:27:59.684]  I can't, there's no reason to watch it.
[03:28:00.624 --> 03:28:08.809]  And the way these narcissists work, and by the way, a lot of these communities, quote unquote, now that there is a black community or a gay community, that makes no sense.
[03:28:09.389 --> 03:28:11.050]  Communities are geographic.
[03:28:11.931 --> 03:28:12.311]  It's not,
[03:28:13.012 --> 03:28:15.674]  Or based on belief or based on culture.
[03:28:15.694 --> 03:28:18.095]  It's not based on skin color or where you put the ween.
[03:28:19.456 --> 03:28:37.286]  They don't, when you take these socialists and a lot of these revolutionary types, a lot of the oligarchs, they use something called proxy warriors, where they take these kind of weakened groups or these groups that are kind of all over the map.
[03:28:37.990 --> 03:28:44.675]  And they inflate them to destabilize the society, and you see that with homosexuals and Black America.
[03:28:44.695 --> 03:28:48.878]  Oh, oh, we'll be back in... Oh, we gotta take a break here.
[03:28:48.898 --> 03:28:51.260]  I was about to start really crushing some homers.
[03:28:51.880 --> 03:28:54.602]  I was about to start really just hitting the body and then a big hook.
[03:28:55.303 --> 03:28:56.323]  I'll see you guys in a second.
[03:28:56.343 --> 03:29:00.106]  And in the meantime, think about whether or not watching something is being a part of it, even if you mock it.
[03:29:00.726 --> 03:29:01.367]  Interesting stuff.
[03:29:06.889 --> 03:29:08.650]  Let's go to Megan in Texas.
[03:29:08.710 --> 03:29:09.470]  Megan, you're on the air.
[03:29:09.490 --> 03:29:10.010]  Thanks for holding.
[03:29:10.030 --> 03:29:10.290]  Go ahead.
[03:29:10.490 --> 03:29:10.830]  Hi, Alex.
[03:29:10.850 --> 03:29:11.371]  How are you today?
[03:29:11.531 --> 03:29:11.931]  I'm awesome.
[03:29:11.951 --> 03:29:12.611]  Thank you for calling.
[03:29:12.671 --> 03:29:14.512]  I'm gonna give you a little bit of my background.
[03:29:14.532 --> 03:29:16.092]  I was born and raised in California.
[03:29:16.212 --> 03:29:18.293]  I lived through the downfall of California.
[03:29:18.413 --> 03:29:24.095]  My husband and I got out of there as soon as we graduated from school, came to Texas because to us it was a passion of freedom.
[03:29:24.295 --> 03:29:28.939]  And I'm looking at what's happening to Trump right now, and I'm telling you right now, this whole country's going the way of California.
[03:29:28.959 --> 03:29:30.200]  We're going to be disenfranchised.
[03:29:30.280 --> 03:29:32.361]  If they get him out, that's a gateway right there.
[03:29:32.421 --> 03:29:34.523]  There's no more middle of the country anymore.
[03:29:34.543 --> 03:29:35.524]  We're not going to have a say.
[03:29:35.544 --> 03:29:38.066]  I mean, we're killing babies, and we're poisoning the ones we're not killing.
[03:29:38.086 --> 03:29:45.071]  We're just here in Texas trying to raise our three little girls, and I just... What do you think we're going to... If they manage to get him out, what's our contingency plan?
[03:29:45.091 --> 03:29:45.912]  Where do we go from there?
[03:29:46.092 --> 03:29:49.833]  Megan, I hear the earnestness in your voice, the concern, and I absolutely agree with you.
[03:29:50.153 --> 03:29:52.654]  They hit Europe with 15 million military-age men.
[03:29:52.754 --> 03:29:53.394]  It's collapsed.
[03:29:53.535 --> 03:29:54.395]  They broke their borders.
[03:29:54.435 --> 03:29:55.375]  They're breaking ours.
[03:29:55.555 --> 03:29:56.255]  It's treason.
[03:29:56.375 --> 03:30:00.257]  The governor of New Mexico, the governor of California has pulled National Guard off.
[03:30:00.397 --> 03:30:02.638]  We have tens of thousands, four caravans coming.
[03:30:02.858 --> 03:30:06.099]  Five million have announced they're coming in a major gallop pull.
[03:30:06.259 --> 03:30:07.839]  This is insane.
[03:30:07.999 --> 03:30:09.220]  I mean, it is on.
[03:30:09.600 --> 03:30:11.901]  And again, they're using these people as weapons.
[03:30:11.961 --> 03:30:12.541]  They're saying,
[03:30:13.061 --> 03:30:18.687]  No deal on government shutdown unless you get rid of the 100,000 beds and only make it 16,500.
[03:30:18.987 --> 03:30:21.770]  They're literally saying you can't hold rapists and murderers.
[03:30:22.150 --> 03:30:25.473]  They're saying you can't check who the kids are with or what diseases they have.
[03:30:25.854 --> 03:30:31.199]  This is the lawless world government breaking of America with the Democrat collaborators running it all.
[03:30:31.459 --> 03:30:33.019]  You're absolutely right.
[03:30:33.039 --> 03:30:36.720]  Yeah, I feel like not only that, my husband and I are both business owners.
[03:30:36.860 --> 03:30:43.502]  And I hate to say this, but the brain-dead masses, you try to get through to these people, they're so asleep and zombified.
[03:30:43.542 --> 03:30:46.922]  And I just want to say, the people who don't live in border states, they have no clue.
[03:30:46.942 --> 03:30:50.683]  They have no clue what's going to happen when all these people come in and overrun us.
[03:30:50.763 --> 03:30:51.643]  I've seen it happen.
[03:30:51.703 --> 03:30:54.924]  You can go to the downtown area I grew up in, and it's nothing but Spanish.
[03:30:54.984 --> 03:30:57.045]  You go to the Walmart, everything's in Spanish.
[03:30:57.065 --> 03:30:58.865]  If you didn't know Spanish, you didn't get a job.
[03:30:59.005 --> 03:31:02.248]  This is the globalist plan, and it's absolutely two minutes to midnight.
[03:31:02.268 --> 03:31:04.349]  California used to be just like Texas.
[03:31:04.429 --> 03:31:06.131]  It's now a collapsing hellhole.
[03:31:06.171 --> 03:31:06.991]  God bless you, Megan.
[03:31:08.152 --> 03:31:11.375]  Megan was on fire, ladies and gentlemen, and her warning is absolutely true.
[03:31:11.395 --> 03:31:12.196]  Are you going to listen to her?
[03:31:13.297 --> 03:31:17.120]  Because a lot of Texans, a lot of Oklahomans went out to California.
[03:31:18.550 --> 03:31:22.754]  And now they've come back because the state is gone, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:31:22.975 --> 03:31:25.597]  We have some affiliates out there, a lot of great people, a beautiful state.
[03:31:26.058 --> 03:31:29.982]  But it's gone, and we have to admit, this is the mindset, this is the program into the future.
[03:31:36.733 --> 03:31:37.213]  Here's the thing.
[03:31:37.273 --> 03:31:38.034]  I'm not giving up.
[03:31:38.794 --> 03:31:40.635]  Because I know we've got truth and justice on our side.
[03:31:40.675 --> 03:31:43.397]  But it takes money to wage this war.
[03:31:43.777 --> 03:31:45.038]  You're spreading the word.
[03:31:45.138 --> 03:31:45.919]  You're praying for us.
[03:31:45.999 --> 03:31:47.500]  And you're financially supporting us.
[03:31:47.580 --> 03:31:48.380]  It's key.
[03:31:48.420 --> 03:31:49.121]  It's essential.
[03:31:49.461 --> 03:31:50.842]  It's absolute like oxygen.
[03:31:51.142 --> 03:31:51.822]  We have to have it.
[03:31:51.862 --> 03:31:54.024]  And we've got great products you already need.
[03:31:54.044 --> 03:31:55.104]  I mean, take fish oil.
[03:31:55.164 --> 03:31:57.205]  What it does for your heart, your brain, energy.
[03:31:57.326 --> 03:31:58.906]  I don't even usually take a nootropic.
[03:31:59.047 --> 03:32:04.650]  If I'm up at 10 o'clock at night and I gotta work till 3am on Coast to Coast AM or some show, I pop five fish oils.
[03:32:04.970 --> 03:32:06.471]  Nobody calls fish oil nootropic.
[03:32:06.992 --> 03:32:08.173]  Your brain's electrochemical.
[03:32:08.333 --> 03:32:10.575]  It's basically made out of what fish oil is.
[03:32:10.755 --> 03:32:12.136]  Fish oil is what floats my boat.
[03:32:13.057 --> 03:32:14.338]  I mean, I take it every morning right now.
[03:32:14.578 --> 03:32:15.999]  First thing I get up at 6 a.m.
[03:32:16.119 --> 03:32:19.242]  with my coffee, I bang back three big old fat juicy fish oils.
[03:32:19.582 --> 03:32:21.444]  And so, our ultimate krill oil.
[03:32:21.664 --> 03:32:24.785]  It's even better than the fish oil, what it does for your brain, but there's no way to denature it.
[03:32:24.845 --> 03:32:28.207]  It gives you the burps, I'm not gonna lie to you, but if you can deal with it, it's it's it.
[03:32:28.267 --> 03:32:30.388]  The ultimate krill oil is rocket fuel, baby.
[03:32:30.528 --> 03:32:31.769]  I mean, it's the next level.
[03:32:31.889 --> 03:32:34.650]  Ultimate fish oil, all crafted out of fjords, amazing.
[03:32:34.670 --> 03:32:37.031]  Doesn't give you the burpees, neither does honor roll.
[03:32:37.171 --> 03:32:39.872]  It's amazing for your kids, small caplets, but I tend to like honor roll.
[03:32:39.972 --> 03:32:41.793]  Okay, I'm a fish oil addict, I'm not gonna lie.
[03:32:41.933 --> 03:32:42.773]  I gobble the stuff.
[03:32:43.014 --> 03:32:44.414]  Coffee's a thing of the past now.
[03:32:44.794 --> 03:32:45.995]  Brain force is a thing of the past.
[03:32:46.175 --> 03:32:47.776]  And for different people, different things.
[03:32:48.658 --> 03:32:51.661]  I'm just telling you fish oil is numero uno.
[03:32:52.241 --> 03:32:53.983]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or AAA253-3139.
[03:32:54.003 --> 03:32:56.085]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.262 --> 03:33:24.465]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:33:25.165 --> 03:33:33.971]  It's Alex Jones with Owen Benjamin.
[03:33:34.111 --> 03:33:37.574]  That little hook right there is DJ Shadow, Midnight in a Perfect World.
[03:33:38.194 --> 03:33:48.301]  And as they were just playing that, it dawned on me that I should do a whole music episode with you guys one day about the form of music, the logos of music.
[03:33:49.187 --> 03:33:50.968]  God's word in music.
[03:33:51.408 --> 03:34:03.654]  It's, and how it, you know, fusion jazz and John Cage and all these destructive forms of music were an attempt to rewrite the natural order of the universe.
[03:34:04.375 --> 03:34:06.436]  And it's pretty fascinating, but I'm gonna stay on topic.
[03:34:06.496 --> 03:34:10.978]  So we're talking about the Oscars and they're called proxy warriors, right?
[03:34:11.038 --> 03:34:17.181]  So people with real power will build up these smaller kind of
[03:34:18.300 --> 03:34:21.641]  Not, I wouldn't say fringe, but corruptible groups.
[03:34:22.261 --> 03:34:25.162]  And they build up their ego and they give them lots of money and weapons.
[03:34:25.422 --> 03:34:28.443]  And the weapons can be words or influence in media.
[03:34:29.083 --> 03:34:33.385]  And they do it to keep a society destabilized and to keep the family broken.
[03:34:33.905 --> 03:34:39.046]  And then, here's the punchline, a lot of times in history, they then kill those guys.
[03:34:39.967 --> 03:34:41.227]  So as you're watching
[03:34:42.319 --> 03:34:49.282]  This increase in LGBTQ AIP, you know, and all these additions to this ridiculous satanic alphabet.
[03:34:50.543 --> 03:34:58.746]  And as you watch these Hollywood elites push these agendas, and it's all about, you know, reparations for slavery, and it's all nonsense.
[03:34:58.786 --> 03:34:59.727]  We know it's all nonsense.
[03:35:00.087 --> 03:35:01.928]  Those people aren't going to benefit from it.
[03:35:02.628 --> 03:35:04.429]  It's just to destabilize the family.
[03:35:04.469 --> 03:35:04.609]  So
[03:35:05.734 --> 03:35:13.367]  You know, I've had friends that are still going to these type of events, like Oscars and stuff, and I'm, you know, starting a farm.
[03:35:13.828 --> 03:35:14.870]  I have two children.
[03:35:14.910 --> 03:35:15.872]  We're working on a third.
[03:35:16.152 --> 03:35:17.014]  I'm out in the country.
[03:35:17.054 --> 03:35:18.597]  I'm not connected to that at all.
[03:35:19.432 --> 03:35:26.835]  And it's insane to me when people think that you're jealous of something that you couldn't, there's no amount of money you would do for.
[03:35:26.855 --> 03:35:31.777]  You know, people are like, you're just jealous that you're not still on a TV show here in LA.
[03:35:32.397 --> 03:35:38.500]  That's literally like saying you're just jealous that you couldn't put a hot poker in your wiener hole.
[03:35:40.074 --> 03:35:41.014]  And let that sink in.
[03:35:41.074 --> 03:35:43.175]  Let that sink in how insane that is.
[03:35:43.215 --> 03:35:45.596]  Like, to me, the whole L.A.
[03:35:46.276 --> 03:35:56.960]  idol worship and, you know, the sodomy lobby is so horrifying, so soul-sucking, and so just... They're all on anxiety pills and depression pills.
[03:35:57.000 --> 03:36:00.502]  Half of them are just... One of my friends just hung himself last week.
[03:36:00.542 --> 03:36:01.742]  Brody Stevens, the comedian.
[03:36:02.282 --> 03:36:05.343]  One of the only sane, right-wing comedians in L.A.
[03:36:05.363 --> 03:36:07.104]  And he just... He tapped out.
[03:36:07.975 --> 03:36:09.436]  I mean, that's not a healthy environment.
[03:36:09.496 --> 03:36:13.960]  You know, it's like they're like, oh, you're just jealous.
[03:36:13.980 --> 03:36:18.244]  You're just making fun of Joe the Toe Rogan because you're jealous.
[03:36:19.184 --> 03:36:24.529]  That's literally like saying you would do anything to put a hot poker in your wean hole.
[03:36:27.111 --> 03:36:30.033]  So as I'm thinking about the Oscars, I
[03:36:31.417 --> 03:36:33.238]  Yeah, no, Hollywood is insane.
[03:36:33.258 --> 03:36:34.078]  You give up everything.
[03:36:34.098 --> 03:36:36.679]  And it's lured through sex, mostly.
[03:36:37.199 --> 03:36:38.100]  Sexual freedom.
[03:36:38.240 --> 03:36:41.401]  And that all started with, what was that guy's name?
[03:36:41.441 --> 03:36:42.001]  Foucault.
[03:36:43.402 --> 03:36:53.586]  Foucault and all those guys in the 70s that made that satanic deal where it's like the left will now no longer focus on economics or ending war or any of that stuff.
[03:36:53.626 --> 03:36:59.068]  It's only about turning your, being allowed to have sexual perversion to destabilize the,
[03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:03.570]  And Foucault, of course, died of AIDS in a San Francisco bathhouse.
[03:37:04.510 --> 03:37:05.630]  Because that's how that rolls.
[03:37:06.911 --> 03:37:08.231]  You know, sodomy is no joke, man.
[03:37:08.751 --> 03:37:16.213]  Sodomy, the reason sodomy is so powerfully evil is because it takes that which is fruitful and makes it sterile.
[03:37:16.793 --> 03:37:19.334]  The sex act is what gives you life.
[03:37:20.434 --> 03:37:25.995]  And so sodomy is taking that which gives you life and making it sterile, making it nothing.
[03:37:26.615 --> 03:37:28.916]  And in many times, that which gives you death.
[03:37:30.259 --> 03:37:34.881]  You know, it's the same with fiat debt-based usury currency.
[03:37:35.582 --> 03:37:38.703]  It's taking something dead and making it appear to create.
[03:37:39.764 --> 03:37:41.485]  And when it doesn't, it's the same with sodomy.
[03:37:41.525 --> 03:37:44.306]  It's taking something that creates and making it dead.
[03:37:45.227 --> 03:37:48.228]  And I'm not one of those people that's like, you're disgusting.
[03:37:48.268 --> 03:37:49.389]  Look at you, you sodomite.
[03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:50.229]  You're so disgusting.
[03:37:50.269 --> 03:37:51.810]  Those people I think are kind of projecting.
[03:37:52.290 --> 03:37:54.992]  I had some priests growing up that were like that and they were projecting.
[03:37:55.612 --> 03:37:59.174]  And so a good way to tell if someone is actually saying what's real
[03:37:59.947 --> 03:38:07.653]  Or if they're projecting their own inner demons that they haven't conquered yet, is are they like really into calling you names about it?
[03:38:08.174 --> 03:38:09.094]  Don't trust those guys.
[03:38:09.214 --> 03:38:15.580]  When it's like, look at you, you disgusting, look at you, like those guys are usually hiding a deep secret.
[03:38:15.840 --> 03:38:21.144]  That's why I just focus on the act itself and how gross it is.
[03:38:21.564 --> 03:38:27.189]  And the reason it's becoming a real situation is because they're now making it a brave act.
[03:38:27.887 --> 03:38:29.968]  It's one thing if a society tolerates it.
[03:38:30.768 --> 03:38:32.989]  It's another thing if a society elevates it.
[03:38:33.729 --> 03:38:44.373]  And the elevation of these lifeless acts, it's very similar to vampires.
[03:38:44.673 --> 03:38:48.335]  I know I'm all over the map right now, but, you know, it's Infowars.
[03:38:48.375 --> 03:38:50.035]  It's kind of part of it.
[03:38:50.055 --> 03:38:57.258]  That's one reason why I like this channel so much, is I'm allowed to just duck and throw some haymakers and then back off.
[03:38:58.030 --> 03:39:00.631]  Okay, like a vampire is the opposite of Jesus Christ, right?
[03:39:00.651 --> 03:39:03.671]  So Jesus Christ spills blood to give life.
[03:39:03.732 --> 03:39:06.452]  The vampire takes blood for his eternal life.
[03:39:06.472 --> 03:39:11.193]  Like, alright, so Jesus gives his blood for our eternal life.
[03:39:11.994 --> 03:39:14.334]  The vampire takes blood for his eternal life.
[03:39:14.854 --> 03:39:16.055]  It's a mathematical inverse.
[03:39:16.075 --> 03:39:23.557]  You know, that's why there's so much logo, so much God, God's Word in math, because it's that which is true, right?
[03:39:24.377 --> 03:39:24.577]  So,
[03:39:25.814 --> 03:39:34.925]  That's why sodomy is such an, just such a powerful act of defiance, because it takes that which creates life and makes it sterile.
[03:39:34.965 --> 03:39:36.847]  And that's what's happening with all of feminism.
[03:39:38.148 --> 03:39:42.273]  Because now the draft, and this is a valid, valid
[03:39:44.850 --> 03:39:48.353]  Thing that they're doing, they're saying that women now have to be drafted in the military.
[03:39:48.453 --> 03:39:49.914]  I find that horrifying, obviously.
[03:39:50.374 --> 03:40:00.001]  But if women and men are equal and men can be drafted in the military, it was just in USA Today that women are now going to be drafted into combat positions of the military.
[03:40:00.882 --> 03:40:02.243]  That is the upside down.
[03:40:02.283 --> 03:40:03.403]  See, that's the ultimate trick.
[03:40:03.464 --> 03:40:06.005]  The trick is that Jesus is a vampire.
[03:40:06.065 --> 03:40:07.306]  Vampire is Jesus, right?
[03:40:07.967 --> 03:40:10.889]  That sodomy is brave and families are bad.
[03:40:11.759 --> 03:40:13.200]  Our death, or cowardly.
[03:40:13.380 --> 03:40:15.881]  It couldn't be farther from the truth.
[03:40:16.342 --> 03:40:22.365]  The bravest act you can do is have a child in this world, protect that child, love that child, knowing what this world is.
[03:40:23.586 --> 03:40:32.871]  And abortion, you know, the killing of the woman's child is an act of strength to these people.
[03:40:32.911 --> 03:40:33.911]  It's all upside down.
[03:40:33.971 --> 03:40:40.235]  And when you enter that world of the upside down, you can't navigate it without
[03:40:41.178 --> 03:40:42.839]  Always saying what is true.
[03:40:43.879 --> 03:40:46.881]  And you don't fully know what is true.
[03:40:47.081 --> 03:40:48.061]  Like, we aren't God.
[03:40:48.161 --> 03:40:49.262]  We don't know the whole plan.
[03:40:49.542 --> 03:40:52.743]  We can only say what we believe to be true, what we see to be true.
[03:40:52.763 --> 03:40:55.264]  And I think that's really important in this time.
[03:40:55.284 --> 03:41:05.529]  You know, when we are entering this full inversion, this subversion, this upside down where life is death and death is life, black is, you know, darkness is light, light is darkness.
[03:41:07.090 --> 03:41:07.490]  Because
[03:41:08.408 --> 03:41:20.596]  The only way I the way I judge another human being isn't are they Christian or Catholic or Muslim or Jewish or atheist is what is yes mean yes and no means no.
[03:41:21.017 --> 03:41:21.737]  That's the question.
[03:41:22.798 --> 03:41:24.419]  If you're wrong, you apologize.
[03:41:24.439 --> 03:41:27.681]  Do you see apology as apology or do you see the submission?
[03:41:28.582 --> 03:41:32.845]  And if those things are what you are, I will trust you and I'll be your friend.
[03:41:34.506 --> 03:41:35.827]  But if not, I won't.
[03:41:36.791 --> 03:41:39.733]  And I don't know how I got on this topic.
[03:41:40.093 --> 03:41:42.314]  So I was talking about the Oscars and wiener holes.
[03:41:43.194 --> 03:41:47.537]  And oh yeah, and the father has been removed and it's for a very specific reason.
[03:41:47.577 --> 03:41:53.920]  I was looking at this image of all these parenting magazines and there was no father in any of them.
[03:41:54.620 --> 03:42:01.904]  It's just single women or there was one, there's two gay guys and that's the only representation of males.
[03:42:02.822 --> 03:42:10.428]  And it's for a reason, because the man is... A strong father figure is the connection to Logos, you know?
[03:42:11.789 --> 03:42:18.473]  And so you remove the father and you get a bunch of school shootings, you get a bunch of... Every school shooter in America has had no dad.
[03:42:19.154 --> 03:42:20.435]  No biological dad in the home.
[03:42:21.636 --> 03:42:27.240]  And so this demonizing of the male, of the masculine, this cucking, this soy boy
[03:42:28.363 --> 03:42:32.845]  Nature of the man now that's coming and happening is a way to create slaves.
[03:42:32.985 --> 03:42:35.566]  Because you don't have a father saying, don't do that, that's wrong.
[03:42:36.466 --> 03:42:36.746]  You know?
[03:42:36.866 --> 03:42:42.408]  And so these children grow up to become narcissists and slaves to their own appetites.
[03:42:42.568 --> 03:42:44.569]  And that's the future we have.
[03:42:44.769 --> 03:42:46.090]  All right, I'll be back in a little bit.
[03:42:46.190 --> 03:42:52.812]  I thought that was going to be a very cohesive segment on the Oscars, and I started talking about Jesus and vampires.
[03:42:53.532 --> 03:42:55.173]  But you know, it's InfoWars.
[03:42:55.673 --> 03:42:56.694]  I'll see you guys in a little bit.
[03:42:57.194 --> 03:42:57.474]  Cheers.

[03:44:09.036 --> 03:44:13.780]  I planned every segment today to wear a different t-shirt, and I just get too focused on the news and don't do it.
[03:44:14.561 --> 03:44:15.742]  But if you're a TV viewer, you can see it.
[03:44:15.782 --> 03:44:17.924]  It's Don't California, My USA.
[03:44:19.445 --> 03:44:21.127]  And it's got Infowars.com on the right.
[03:44:22.142 --> 03:44:22.462]  I think?
[03:44:41.988 --> 03:44:42.448]  I don't know.
[03:45:12.208 --> 03:45:14.171]  And then you're just getting the love, not the hate.
[03:45:14.251 --> 03:45:18.375]  Or if you wear a Molon Labe, you don't think leftists can speak Latin or know that means come and take it.
[03:45:18.496 --> 03:45:18.636]  No.
[03:45:18.756 --> 03:45:22.080]  All they do is talk about how smart they are and listen to NPR and the little snake voices all day.
[03:45:22.100 --> 03:45:23.541]  We've got over 100 t-shirts.
[03:45:23.842 --> 03:45:25.283]  Some are steadfast.
[03:45:25.464 --> 03:45:26.725]  One design I made 20 years ago.
[03:45:26.745 --> 03:45:27.366]  22 years ago now.
[03:45:28.447 --> 03:45:30.008]  Mass murderers of Greek uncontrolled works.
[03:45:30.188 --> 03:45:33.110]  I sat there on Photoshop and put Hitler, Stalin, and Mao by each other.
[03:45:33.170 --> 03:45:36.993]  On the back it says, politicians love disarmed peasants, which I got from a bumper sticker.
[03:45:37.013 --> 03:45:40.595]  Then we've got all these great designer shirts with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln on them.
[03:45:40.675 --> 03:45:42.336]  So we've got high-end shirts that are great.
[03:45:42.436 --> 03:45:43.717]  You know, it'd be $50 at the mall.
[03:45:43.937 --> 03:45:44.738]  They're $25 here.
[03:45:44.778 --> 03:45:46.178]  We've got other shirts that are as low as $9.95.
[03:45:47.079 --> 03:45:47.900]  It's all there.
[03:45:48.060 --> 03:45:48.600]  Trump 2020.
[03:45:48.700 --> 03:45:50.042]  Won't tread on me.
[03:45:50.222 --> 03:45:51.323]  Re-elect 45.
[03:45:51.483 --> 03:45:52.404]  Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[03:45:52.644 --> 03:45:53.725]  Hey, show them the George Washington.
[03:45:53.745 --> 03:45:55.766]  That's really good, soft, high-quality fabric.
[03:45:55.826 --> 03:45:58.288]  That's one of my favorite shirts I wear, is the George Washington.
[03:45:58.449 --> 03:46:05.334]  And it's him from his, before the French-Indian War, when he was a colonial scout, expanding the frontiers as a scientist.
[03:46:05.475 --> 03:46:07.456]  And as an engineer, he was out there surveying.
[03:46:07.576 --> 03:46:10.719]  And so that's kind of the George Washington without the tomahawk and a musket.
[03:46:10.779 --> 03:46:11.940]  It's an adventure.
[03:46:11.960 --> 03:46:12.640]  Don't California my USA.
[03:46:29.019 --> 03:46:30.220]  Who wouldn't want to wear a shirt like that?
[03:46:30.260 --> 03:46:33.082]  Or Alexandria Cortez as the dog?
[03:46:33.223 --> 03:46:38.967]  You know, she said, we'll have you subpoenaed or arrested, Donald Trump Jr., because you said, socialists eat their dogs, capitalists walk them.
[03:46:39.088 --> 03:46:40.829]  So I said, okay, well, we'll just put that shirt on.
[03:46:41.009 --> 03:46:42.691]  And I predict it to be a bestseller.
[03:46:42.771 --> 03:46:43.171]  It is.
[03:46:43.451 --> 03:46:44.252]  I've done two runs.
[03:46:44.272 --> 03:46:44.972]  This is the last run.
[03:46:44.992 --> 03:46:47.575]  We're going to come up with a new variant of the Cortez shirt.
[03:46:47.675 --> 03:46:51.298]  But this limited edition is about to go the way of the Goonie Bird, which means extinct.
[03:46:51.478 --> 03:46:53.319]  So if you want it, InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:47:06.201 --> 03:47:08.924]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.354 --> 03:47:25.204]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones with Owen Benjamin.
[03:47:29.428 --> 03:47:30.809]  Hi, everybody, I'm back.
[03:47:31.249 --> 03:47:42.393]  And so this episode, or this segment, I'd like to talk about, you know, everyone's been talking about the Jussie Smollett situation, and let's get to the root of it.
[03:47:43.354 --> 03:47:48.156]  My friend, Steven Crowder, and I made this sketch over a year ago.
[03:47:48.396 --> 03:47:50.496]  It's called Hate Crime Court, I believe.
[03:47:51.297 --> 03:47:52.497]  I'll play you guys a little piece of it.
[03:47:52.537 --> 03:47:59.180]  You can get, you can watch the rest of it at youtube.com slash Owen Benjamin comedy, but check this out and then we'll talk about it.
[03:48:00.649 --> 03:48:02.670]  Court, the people are real.
[03:48:02.990 --> 03:48:05.111]  The cases... maybe.
[03:48:05.131 --> 03:48:07.052]  This is Razzmatazz.
[03:48:07.272 --> 03:48:11.694]  He's accusing the defendant of striking him with a baseball bat twice in the ribs because he's a homosexual.
[03:48:11.974 --> 03:48:13.415]  This is Not-K-Jared.
[03:48:13.555 --> 03:48:16.056]  He claims Razzmatazz is full of shit.
[03:48:16.717 --> 03:48:19.178]  Honorable Judge Van Andel presiding, please rise.
[03:48:23.580 --> 03:48:28.182]  So, Jared, it appears you assaulted Razzmatazz.
[03:48:29.226 --> 03:48:32.573]  With a baseball bat striking him twice in the ribcage.
[03:48:32.673 --> 03:48:34.417]  Now you are being charged.
[03:48:35.219 --> 03:48:41.163]  With assault with a deadly weapon, which... Your Honor, as a gay man, I request that he gets, uh, the hate crime amount of years.
[03:48:41.883 --> 03:48:42.824]  Like, a lot of years.
[03:48:43.164 --> 03:48:45.046]  Not the normal amount you give normal people.
[03:48:45.666 --> 03:48:48.448]  I want you to, uh, you know, he hate-crimed me.
[03:48:48.588 --> 03:48:49.108]  Give him hell, Judge.
[03:48:49.128 --> 03:48:51.410]  Your Honor, this man is not gay!
[03:48:51.630 --> 03:48:53.511]  I caught him having sex with my wife!
[03:48:54.212 --> 03:48:56.853]  He just wants me to go to prison so he can... Hate crime, Your Honor.
[03:48:57.274 --> 03:48:59.115]  This man was motivated by pure homophobia.
[03:48:59.735 --> 03:49:04.679]  As he was striking me, he was saying stuff like, maybe this will teach you from being gay and sucking off dudes.
[03:49:05.399 --> 03:49:06.120]  Give him hell, your honor.
[03:49:06.320 --> 03:49:08.701]  He clearly just bought that wig today from Hot Topic.
[03:49:08.762 --> 03:49:09.862]  I can see the tag.
[03:49:09.882 --> 03:49:10.503]  No, it's not a wig.
[03:49:10.883 --> 03:49:11.403]  It's my hair.
[03:49:12.064 --> 03:49:13.925]  I also really like my chemical romance, your honor.
[03:49:14.165 --> 03:49:20.590]  Mr. Razmatez, you mean to tell me that you are a homosexual, but were engaging in relations with this man's wife?
[03:49:20.610 --> 03:49:22.411]  Sexuality is a very complicated thing, your honor.
[03:49:22.771 --> 03:49:26.074]  Yes, I'm gay, but I prefer to exclusively have sex with women.
[03:49:26.954 --> 03:49:27.615]  Give him hell, your honor.
[03:49:27.755 --> 03:49:28.295]  Hate crime me.
[03:49:28.676 --> 03:49:33.019]  Well, I'm quite certain he struck you because you were having sex with his wife.
[03:49:35.401 --> 03:49:35.881]  Look at my shirt.
[03:49:35.901 --> 03:49:37.121]  Look at my fanny pack.
[03:49:38.442 --> 03:49:40.262]  Dude, my name's Razzmatazz.
[03:49:40.562 --> 03:49:41.743]  I'm the gayest guy alive.
[03:49:41.863 --> 03:49:43.863]  No, he changed his name on his driver's license.
[03:49:44.023 --> 03:49:44.884]  His name is Dan.
[03:49:44.924 --> 03:49:45.324]  Says you.
[03:49:45.344 --> 03:49:46.824]  I own a f***ing smart car, dude.
[03:49:46.844 --> 03:49:50.985]  No, Mr. Razzmatazz, that's not how hate crimes work.
[03:49:51.285 --> 03:49:56.707]  Sentencing is required to determine motivation that the crime was committed because the victim is
[03:49:57.467 --> 03:49:59.128]  A part of a marginalized group.
[03:49:59.148 --> 03:49:59.968]  I just told you.
[03:50:00.328 --> 03:50:06.031]  He was hitting me because I'm a fairy and not because I was having sex with his wife.
[03:50:06.051 --> 03:50:07.131]  That never happened.
[03:50:07.611 --> 03:50:08.472]  It's true, Your Honor.
[03:50:08.632 --> 03:50:09.352]  I was there.
[03:50:09.792 --> 03:50:14.254]  He repeatedly beat him and called this man a faggot while we were doing it.
[03:50:14.274 --> 03:50:16.055]  Thanks, babe.
[03:50:16.115 --> 03:50:17.815]  All right.
[03:50:17.875 --> 03:50:26.839]  So the beauty of comedy, like honest comedy, is I think it was Tim Allen who said, I exaggerate to clarify.
[03:50:28.075 --> 03:50:34.819]  And that's why there's been such a horrible witch hunt against comedians.
[03:50:35.059 --> 03:50:39.982]  You know, you can get my specials at HugePianist.com because I have to self-produce them now.
[03:50:40.623 --> 03:50:46.386]  Because there's a witch hunt against comedians because we kind of show the future.
[03:50:46.406 --> 03:50:55.332]  Because while we're wrestling with these ideas, it's literally, no, not literally, it's metaphorically, it's metaphorical time travel.
[03:50:56.440 --> 03:51:02.245]  Because what we were mocking is now a story that people are finally talking about.
[03:51:02.325 --> 03:51:03.866]  Like, what is a hate crime?
[03:51:03.886 --> 03:51:04.787]  This is ridiculous.
[03:51:05.347 --> 03:51:09.150]  That is, aren't all acts of violence motivated by some form of hate?
[03:51:09.771 --> 03:51:19.459]  You know, how do you use someone's motivation to give them more or less years of a sentence based on their skin color or their sexual provocativities?
[03:51:19.799 --> 03:51:21.640]  How do you establish someone's gay?
[03:51:21.740 --> 03:51:24.703]  That was one of the, another one of the jokes that
[03:51:25.760 --> 03:51:30.082]  The underlying joke of that sketch was, how do you prove someone's gay?
[03:51:30.842 --> 03:51:38.566]  You know, Razzmatazz, the character I wrote for myself, was saying, listen, judge, I'm a gay guy who only has sex with women.
[03:51:39.866 --> 03:51:40.867]  You know, hate crime him.
[03:51:41.067 --> 03:51:43.288]  It was motivated by hate, not that I was with his wife.
[03:51:44.568 --> 03:51:47.190]  And do you have to be with one guy?
[03:51:47.210 --> 03:51:49.531]  Do you have to think about guys?
[03:51:49.591 --> 03:51:52.212]  Do you have to really like the song Rainbow Connection?
[03:51:53.126 --> 03:51:57.789]  Like, what qualifies someone as part of the gay community?
[03:51:58.570 --> 03:52:03.093]  You know, what if you wear a dress once a week?
[03:52:03.273 --> 03:52:04.113]  What if it's a kilt?
[03:52:05.514 --> 03:52:09.197]  What if you are a big UFC fan, but for the wrong reasons?
[03:52:11.238 --> 03:52:16.299]  And that is when you realize tyranny and an abandonment of truth and logos have taken over.
[03:52:16.939 --> 03:52:23.041]  And that's why I highly recommend focusing on things that you can control, your faith, your family, your food, you know, the three F's.
[03:52:24.341 --> 03:52:27.042]  But this isn't a new situation.
[03:52:27.082 --> 03:52:40.705]  As we watch this Jussie Smollett thing, the whole argument over him staging this to get attention, all that, it's going past the entire interesting meat of the situation, which is what is a hate crime?
[03:52:42.421 --> 03:52:48.326]  So if someone murders someone just because they hate them, but let's say someone hates people named Gary.
[03:52:48.787 --> 03:52:49.988]  You're like, ah, I hate Garys.
[03:52:50.528 --> 03:52:51.729]  My daddy hated Garys.
[03:52:52.210 --> 03:52:53.431]  His daddy hated Garys.
[03:52:53.491 --> 03:52:54.292]  I'm a Gary hater.
[03:52:55.212 --> 03:52:57.374]  And you murder everyone you know named Gary.
[03:52:58.475 --> 03:52:59.476]  Is that a hate crime?
[03:53:00.077 --> 03:53:09.225]  No, because being named Gary isn't a protected class, which brings us full circle to the beginning of what we're talking about with, um, uh,
[03:53:09.969 --> 03:53:13.071]  You know, proxy warriors, protected classes of people.
[03:53:13.271 --> 03:53:14.051]  It's an irony.
[03:53:14.131 --> 03:53:15.933]  It's one of Satan's punchlines.
[03:53:16.793 --> 03:53:21.116]  Not only are they not protected, they're set up for absolute disaster.
[03:53:22.897 --> 03:53:28.580]  Gays in this country with this protection legislation are not being protected.
[03:53:29.380 --> 03:53:35.264]  In fact, it is all just to subvert the family unit and take down the United States of America.
[03:53:37.060 --> 03:53:38.741]  It's insane.
[03:53:39.161 --> 03:53:42.122]  And you can see it now with the female draft coming up.
[03:53:42.142 --> 03:53:45.943]  Does that sound like the feminism that was preached by a CIA operative?
[03:53:45.963 --> 03:53:47.383]  What was that lady's name?
[03:53:47.723 --> 03:53:48.424]  Gloria Steinem?
[03:53:48.444 --> 03:53:49.684]  Of course not.
[03:53:50.784 --> 03:53:51.825]  You know, it starts small.
[03:53:51.865 --> 03:53:54.585]  It starts with like, women just want the right to wear pants.
[03:53:55.526 --> 03:53:57.566]  And then before you know it, they're cannon fodder.
[03:53:58.567 --> 03:54:05.929]  And the end game is always to destroy the family, because the family is where you get children that can withstand slavery.
[03:54:07.307 --> 03:54:09.329]  Freedom comes from responsibility.
[03:54:09.369 --> 03:54:14.993]  Freedom comes responsibility that you get from your father and compassion and survival that you get from your mother.
[03:54:15.013 --> 03:54:17.154]  Your mother creates the life.
[03:54:17.995 --> 03:54:19.756]  You know, your mother, the mother protects the life.
[03:54:19.796 --> 03:54:24.820]  The mother shows a compassionate view of the world, safety.
[03:54:24.920 --> 03:54:33.927]  And then the father shows the harsh realities of the world, shows work ethic, shows perseverance, shows national identity.
[03:54:35.592 --> 03:54:51.246]  And so without that unit, you have people with no identity, no family, no safety, no security, no context, no logos, no logic, no reason, nothing to allow them to survive in this world, this world that is designed to kill you.
[03:54:51.706 --> 03:54:53.067]  It's designed to enslave you.
[03:54:53.187 --> 03:54:54.088]  It's a fallen world.
[03:54:54.729 --> 03:54:59.993]  Whether you're Christian or not, you can look out the window and realize that the world is designed to kill you.
[03:55:01.234 --> 03:55:03.236]  And so without the family,
[03:55:04.776 --> 03:55:11.601]  Not only are these not protected classes, we are now honoring and celebrating the broken home.
[03:55:11.641 --> 03:55:17.645]  You know, when you have, I didn't watch the Oscars, but in all these award shows, you're like, why come from a single mother?
[03:55:17.665 --> 03:55:20.607]  And everyone's like, yeah, no, where was the dad?
[03:55:21.688 --> 03:55:22.548]  Where was the dad?
[03:55:24.290 --> 03:55:26.671]  It's like, I am gay and proud.
[03:55:26.731 --> 03:55:27.512]  It's like, no.
[03:55:28.897 --> 03:55:30.978]  No, and that isn't homophobia.
[03:55:31.078 --> 03:55:31.899]  That is insane.
[03:55:31.939 --> 03:55:33.279]  That's an insane word.
[03:55:33.439 --> 03:55:34.520]  That doesn't mean anything.
[03:55:35.901 --> 03:55:39.463]  It's one thing to be gay and have to wrestle with that lifestyle.
[03:55:39.523 --> 03:55:40.323]  It's not easy.
[03:55:40.763 --> 03:55:47.207]  And for people like me, and I'm sure a lot of you guys that have actually had long-term friends that are homosexual, it's hard.
[03:55:49.465 --> 03:55:50.686]  It's not an easy life.
[03:55:50.966 --> 03:55:53.286]  It's a life without a lot of stability.
[03:55:53.346 --> 03:55:58.728]  It's a life with a lot of chaos and upheaval and isolation.
[03:55:59.028 --> 03:56:01.489]  And it's not easy.
[03:56:02.550 --> 03:56:14.354]  And so to celebrate this new world of up is down and down is up, it has a purpose.
[03:56:14.394 --> 03:56:16.674]  And the purpose is to destroy the family and to make slaves.
[03:56:16.754 --> 03:56:18.515]  Because freedom of
[03:56:19.389 --> 03:56:21.511]  Responsibility is not freedom, that's slavery.
[03:56:22.211 --> 03:56:26.295]  You know, these are all inverse word tricks where you say, well, I am free.
[03:56:26.315 --> 03:56:33.441]  I am free to openly be trans and nude at an elementary school.
[03:56:34.082 --> 03:56:35.643]  Because they're not teaching this to kids.
[03:56:36.524 --> 03:56:38.265]  You know, in England, they teach
[03:56:40.209 --> 03:56:44.893]  LGBT sodomy stuff to kindergartners now, and you can't take your children out.
[03:56:45.413 --> 03:56:45.974]  It's illegal.
[03:56:46.074 --> 03:56:50.698]  Gay and trans sex education to be taught to five-year-olds in the UK and opting out is illegal.
[03:56:51.018 --> 03:56:51.839]  We all know that.
[03:56:51.979 --> 03:56:52.960]  That's happening in Canada.
[03:56:52.980 --> 03:56:54.001]  It's happening all over Europe.
[03:56:54.021 --> 03:56:55.162]  It's going to happen in America.
[03:56:57.323 --> 03:56:59.385]  That isn't tolerance.
[03:57:00.846 --> 03:57:02.508]  That isn't freedom.
[03:57:02.888 --> 03:57:04.049]  That's the absence of freedom.
[03:57:04.662 --> 03:57:07.744]  That's freedom from responsibility, and it's now finally hitting people.
[03:57:07.784 --> 03:57:12.607]  It's hitting people that were deluded into thinking that abortion is freedom.
[03:57:12.647 --> 03:57:18.771]  Now that it's 40 weeks, even the most hardcore pro-choice people that I've ever known are like, yeah, this is horrifying.
[03:57:18.791 --> 03:57:20.432]  And I'm like, this is just the beginning.
[03:57:22.013 --> 03:57:27.257]  Freedom from your own appetite, freedom from accountability of your own appetites is not freedom, that's slavery.
[03:57:27.637 --> 03:57:32.340]  Freedom comes from discipline, and discipline comes from the family.
[03:57:32.947 --> 03:57:41.553]  And so the way that I fight things that I can't control is to have a good marriage, to raise my kids right, and to do, you know, Info Wars every now and then so I can ramble.
[03:57:42.193 --> 03:57:46.656]  If you want to check me out, hugepianist.com or youtube.com slash OwenBenjaminComedy.
[03:57:47.056 --> 03:57:47.837]  I'll see you guys soon.
[03:57:47.877 --> 03:57:49.118]  It's been a good time.
[03:57:49.658 --> 03:57:49.918]  Peace!
[03:57:53.735 --> 03:57:55.076]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:57:55.156 --> 03:57:56.937]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:57:57.057 --> 03:57:57.478]  It is!
[03:57:57.658 --> 03:58:02.081]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:58:02.541 --> 03:58:03.822]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:58:03.882 --> 03:58:05.623]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:58:05.703 --> 03:58:08.025]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:58:08.205 --> 03:58:09.746]  Brain, body, heart.
[03:58:09.826 --> 03:58:11.227]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[03:58:11.287 --> 03:58:12.508]  You've got the children's.
[03:58:12.648 --> 03:58:13.609]  You've got the adults.
[03:58:13.749 --> 03:58:14.670]  You've got the krill oil.
[03:58:14.770 --> 03:58:18.132]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[03:58:18.172 --> 03:58:20.514]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[03:58:20.754 --> 03:58:21.935]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:58:22.075 --> 03:58:22.756]  And I'm sorry.
[03:58:22.956 --> 03:58:23.857]  You want something like this?
[03:58:23.937 --> 03:58:24.798]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:58:24.918 --> 03:58:27.360]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good.
[03:58:27.420 --> 03:58:27.961]  In my view.
[03:58:28.061 --> 03:58:30.263]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:58:30.403 --> 03:58:32.985]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:58:33.085 --> 03:58:34.727]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:58:36.488 --> 03:58:41.033]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:58:43.991 --> 03:58:49.979]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:58:50.019 --> 03:58:50.801]  I just can't do it!
[03:58:55.507 --> 03:58:58.191]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:58:58.531 --> 03:58:59.693]  While coffee, candy, and
