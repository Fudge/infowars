[00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:22.888]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:24.853]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:37.855]  And this shocking footage is even more painful when you see the albatrosses of CNN and other MSM outlets shearing on the rape.
[00:00:37.855 --> 00:00:48.222]  In fact, it's been found that these systems actually direct the monstrous CEO, Zuckerberg, against the free speech enemies and anyone that tries to not submit.
[00:00:48.982 --> 00:01:00.663]  But most sad of all is other penguins in the independent media simply looking up at the sky and ignoring the vicious rape of their own freedoms and birthright taking place right in front of them.
[00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.773]  We are in a complete war!
[00:01:06.773 --> 00:01:08.855]  And you idiots don't join with the Republic!
[00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:10.337]  You fools!
[00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:11.438]  I want them shut down.
[00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:12.399]  I want them silenced.
[00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:13.119]  I want them muted.
[00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.062]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:01:16.062 --> 00:01:23.510]  Yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[00:01:33.107 --> 00:01:35.929]  Please save the First Amendment!
[00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.651]  Please do the right thing and stand up against Big Ten!
[00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:42.733]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:47.156]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:48.737]  I want them shut down.
[00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:52.699]  We're losing the thread of the concepts that are important to this country.
[00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:56.661]  I don't like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak.
[00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:57.962]  Everybody gets to speak.
[00:01:57.962 --> 00:01:58.963]  I'm a bad person!
[00:01:58.963 --> 00:01:59.743]  I question things!
[00:01:59.743 --> 00:02:00.103]  I'm evil!
[00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:10.178]  How dangerous is Infowars?
[00:02:10.178 --> 00:02:14.420]  I am told this is a garbage disposal.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.942]  I've never seen a garbage disposal.
[00:02:16.942 --> 00:02:21.404]  I've never had one in any place I've ever lived.
[00:02:21.404 --> 00:02:22.744]  It is terrifying.
[00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:27.427]  I don't know what to use it for or what its purpose is.
[00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.330]  Like food scraps?
[00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.512]  Like is this environmentally sound?
[00:02:33.512 --> 00:02:35.134]  I don't know.
[00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:15.892]  Well, that's right.
[00:03:15.892 --> 00:03:18.794]  It's now all over the news.
[00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:45.977]  That there was a secret FISA ruling put out in the middle of 2017 that the Inspector General of the Federal Courts released saying that they were given false information and lied to in three cases.
[00:03:45.977 --> 00:03:58.086]  Now they knew this because the head of the National Security Agency went and warned Trump right after he got into office that the treason had been carried out and that he was unaware of it.
[00:04:01.954 --> 00:04:04.615]  We broke that information.
[00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:09.736]  It was not put in the Federal Register for several months.
[00:04:09.736 --> 00:04:20.319]  And then it was decided, kind of like Trump sometimes just declassifies things out into the open, but doesn't announce it, that we were given the exclusive on that.
[00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.180]  And again, I'm not here at the start of this broadcast bragging.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.461]  I'm explaining to you why they want us destroyed.
[00:04:28.461 --> 00:04:31.062]  Because that was released, that was declassified.
[00:04:33.326 --> 00:04:43.530]  And then no one else, I guess, would run with it, because we got the phone call from the former deputy head of the NSA, the actual technical head of it.
[00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.813]  So when we come back, I'm going to give you a ton of next year's news today, information straight ahead.
[00:04:49.813 --> 00:04:51.474]  By the way, a lot of this is public.
[00:04:51.474 --> 00:04:59.197]  The Democrats, every major Democrat candidate says ban all semiannos and confiscate them and come to your house and kill you if you don't turn them in.
[00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:06.816]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:20.788]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated prebiotic fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[00:05:20.788 --> 00:05:31.275]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[00:05:31.855 --> 00:05:39.240]  InfoWarsLife's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:53.890]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.572]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:27.131 --> 00:06:29.673]  It's Tuesday, May 7th, 2019.
[00:06:29.673 --> 00:06:33.075]  This is InfoWars.
[00:06:33.075 --> 00:06:37.978]  Tomorrow's news today, the most banned, the most hated.
[00:06:37.978 --> 00:06:43.762]  Broadcast the world, you're a tyrant, a pedophile, a communist, a chicken-neck control freak.
[00:06:44.718 --> 00:07:02.471]  But the most powerful broadcast in the world if you believe in renaissance, western culture, and Americana, and the family, and Christianity, and the right to self-defense, and rugged individualism, and the man and the woman in the arena.
[00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:09.536]  If that's what you believe, if that's what burns in your soul, then this broadcast is your destiny.
[00:07:09.536 --> 00:07:11.858]  Powerful new piece that just appeared on Twitter.
[00:07:13.226 --> 00:07:16.208]  Something Wicked is the name of the producer.
[00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:20.791]  Technology, intelligence, media equals tyranny.
[00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:22.112]  And then they came for me.
[00:07:22.112 --> 00:07:23.313]  Here it is.
[00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:26.015]  Eisenhower said, beware the military-industrial complex.
[00:07:26.015 --> 00:07:30.078]  And I would say that that needs to be updated to beware of what I call TIM.
[00:07:30.078 --> 00:07:31.979]  Technology, intelligence, and media.
[00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.832]  That's pretty powerful for radio.
[00:07:49.832 --> 00:07:53.835]  But for TV, it's a must-see.
[00:07:53.835 --> 00:07:59.039]  We've posted the video up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:04.423]  We're going to retweet it out for now on Rob Deuce Twitter.
[00:08:04.423 --> 00:08:09.767]  So if you want to see it, I think Paul Watson tweeted it as well.
[00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:14.150]  But it's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.831]  It tells it all.
[00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:53.361]  Everyone that's pro-America, everyone that stands against collectivism and the big megacorporations, everyone who believes in free speech is either being shadow banned or outright banned everywhere.
[00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:56.784]  And now they've announced they're coming for your bank accounts.
[00:08:56.784 --> 00:08:58.746]  Now they've announced they're going to take your phone service away.
[00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:00.508]  You won't be able to fly on airplanes.
[00:09:00.508 --> 00:09:05.572]  And I guess we're all just going to put up with big corporations using this big digital system where they steal
[00:09:05.572 --> 00:09:16.715]  Heal our data, and oppress us, and spy on us, and Alexa listens to us in our house, and Portal watches and listens to us, Google's Assist, it's all in the news!
[00:09:16.715 --> 00:09:21.296]  They're using it for data against you, and selling it to other companies!
[00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:23.717]  And people put up with that?
[00:09:23.717 --> 00:09:34.640]  So now Facebook's not just gonna watch you in your house, they're gonna tell you whose name you can say, or whose website you can say, and just a reminder, as Mark Dice tweeted,
[00:09:35.697 --> 00:09:41.719]  Mark Zuckerberg says you will not make any positive comments about Alex Jones, or you will be banned.
[00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:44.300]  That's in their official statement.
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.881]  Again, beyond 1984.
[00:09:46.881 --> 00:10:00.005]  We've got a ton of news today that ties into all this more, but the big issue that I just realized the last few days, we've not been beating the drum hard enough on, we have in the past.
[00:10:00.005 --> 00:10:02.726]  I have gone and looked at the, what is it, 22 Democrats running right now?
[00:10:03.982 --> 00:10:15.510]  And I just randomly, last night, went through more than 10 of them, and all of them say, ban semi-autos and confiscate them.
[00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:20.874]  And Cory Booker says, if you don't turn your guns in, we're going to come to your house and kill you!
[00:10:20.874 --> 00:10:22.255]  With a SWAT team.
[00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:24.056]  This is where these maniacs are going.
[00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:24.897]  Total Civil War.
[00:10:24.897 --> 00:10:29.060]  And you look at the looks on their faces and the power trips they're on.
[00:10:30.387 --> 00:10:32.888]  This is a clear and present danger.
[00:10:32.888 --> 00:10:36.750]  That story is a Steve Watson article on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.771]  Ring the alarm.
[00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:39.331]  Raise the alarm.
[00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:40.072]  Get that article out.
[00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:46.635]  But I've asked some of the writers to put together a compendium of quotes and statements because it's official.
[00:10:46.635 --> 00:10:48.496]  The Democratic Party's official
[00:10:51.121 --> 00:11:00.626]  Policy is repeal the Second Amendment and forcibly confiscate, and I'm going to read you the New York Times, the Washington Post, and play some of the quotes right now, but we could spend a whole hour on this.
[00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:02.587]  They're really coming after the guns.
[00:11:02.587 --> 00:11:04.648]  They're really coming with forced inoculations.
[00:11:04.648 --> 00:11:07.149]  They're really saying heterosexuality's bad.
[00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:08.730]  They're really saying the family's bad.
[00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:14.934]  They're really already killing babies after they're born in five states now.
[00:11:14.934 --> 00:11:15.474]  After they're born.
[00:11:16.897 --> 00:11:18.638]  I mean, what comes next?
[00:11:18.638 --> 00:11:23.000]  The bottom has fallen out in Dem-controlled areas.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.721]  And anywhere else Socialists control things, it's a nightmare.
[00:11:25.721 --> 00:11:27.201]  Because they're looters.
[00:11:27.201 --> 00:11:28.302]  They're pirates.
[00:11:28.302 --> 00:11:31.943]  Their operating system is El Diablo.
[00:11:31.943 --> 00:11:33.004]  The serpent.
[00:11:33.004 --> 00:11:34.124]  The snake.
[00:11:34.124 --> 00:11:35.285]  The devil.
[00:11:35.285 --> 00:11:36.065]  Satan.
[00:11:36.065 --> 00:11:37.485]  The Morning Star.
[00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:38.486]  Bacchomet.
[00:11:38.486 --> 00:11:40.187]  Beelzebub.
[00:11:40.187 --> 00:11:42.688]  You know?
[00:11:42.688 --> 00:11:43.028]  Moloch.
[00:11:43.973 --> 00:11:45.294]  The bad guy.
[00:11:45.294 --> 00:11:46.775]  Old Scratch.
[00:11:46.775 --> 00:11:50.118]  The devil.
[00:11:50.118 --> 00:11:51.879]  People say, why do they go out of their way to do that?
[00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:53.621]  They're evil!
[00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:55.122]  They're a crew of evil!
[00:11:55.122 --> 00:12:01.828]  You look at Booker, or Harris, or Hillary, they all look like psychopathic killers.
[00:12:01.828 --> 00:12:08.373]  If you walked into a store, and they came over to help you, you'd get the shivers and, whoa, I mean, these are scary people!
[00:12:08.373 --> 00:12:11.956]  Their eyes glow with evil!
[00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:17.896]  Because there's nobody home, folks.
[00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:22.536]  They're avatars.
[00:12:22.536 --> 00:12:25.057]  Look out.
[00:12:25.057 --> 00:12:26.557]  Look out.
[00:12:26.557 --> 00:12:28.878]  Here is a very important piece.
[00:12:28.878 --> 00:12:39.120]  I don't normally play something four or five times a day, but this is a compilation just of a few of the people on mainstream news saying, ban everybody with the most authoritarian relish you've ever seen.
[00:12:40.447 --> 00:12:42.449]  Why are they doing this now?
[00:12:42.449 --> 00:12:47.675]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[00:12:47.675 --> 00:12:56.304]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:12:56.304 --> 00:13:01.290]  Now that they kicked him off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.474]  You have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[00:13:05.474 --> 00:13:14.302]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[00:13:14.302 --> 00:13:15.864]  I have no issue with it at all.
[00:13:15.864 --> 00:13:16.965]  I want them shut down.
[00:13:16.965 --> 00:13:17.926]  I want them silenced.
[00:13:17.926 --> 00:13:18.747]  I want them muted.
[00:13:18.747 --> 00:13:23.471]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:25.233]  I want them shut down.
[00:13:25.233 --> 00:13:26.114]  I want them muted.
[00:13:27.395 --> 00:13:29.456]  I want them completely silenced.
[00:13:29.456 --> 00:13:32.698]  That's not creepy at all, is it?
[00:13:32.698 --> 00:13:37.860]  As Tucker Carlson famously said.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.621]  That's what's going on here.
[00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:42.642]  That's the plan.
[00:13:42.642 --> 00:13:44.343]  That's the program.
[00:13:44.343 --> 00:13:53.948]  Flaming, naked authoritarianism coming for you, and they believe you're weak, they look at you, and they think you're a pushover.
[00:13:53.948 --> 00:13:55.829]  They think they can completely dominate you.
[00:13:56.792 --> 00:14:05.382]  Now, we're going to go to break and come back with the plan to take your guns and you think Trump's going to protect you?
[00:14:05.382 --> 00:14:09.527]  We're two years out from him being gone if he doesn't wake up and defend the First Amendment.
[00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:14.090]  And I think right now, Trump's going to be removed from office.
[00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:15.470]  They're going to engage in election fraud.
[00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.531]  They're going to remove him.
[00:14:16.531 --> 00:14:17.251]  He's even said that.
[00:14:17.251 --> 00:14:18.571]  He said they can only win by cheating.
[00:14:18.571 --> 00:14:19.551]  And they're going to cheat.
[00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:20.392]  These are criminals.
[00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:21.852]  They've already been caught cheating.
[00:14:21.852 --> 00:14:24.533]  And then they're going to go to full civil war.
[00:14:24.533 --> 00:14:25.673]  You think, well, that's crazy.
[00:14:25.673 --> 00:14:27.494]  Yeah, they're crazy.
[00:14:27.494 --> 00:14:31.255]  So if you care about your family, your future, and I know you do, we're in a red-level emergency.
[00:14:31.255 --> 00:14:31.955]  Now we're going to break.
[00:14:33.834 --> 00:14:43.718]  But one reason we've had trouble funding ourselves the last five months is our third biggest seller is Secret 12, high quality, vitamin B12.
[00:14:43.718 --> 00:14:46.199]  Methylcobalamin.
[00:14:46.199 --> 00:14:50.881]  And people love it, it goes over the tongue, energy, stamina, focus, your whole body, it's a building block, everything.
[00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:52.122]  It's just as important as clean iodine.
[00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:54.510]  And it's just been really hard to get.
[00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.153]  We've had really problems sourcing it, but we were able to.
[00:14:58.153 --> 00:15:09.902]  And we were able to, with a new contract and a new company, to have the high quality organic methylcobalamin, highest quality out there, and to double the strength of it.
[00:15:09.902 --> 00:15:16.247]  So I'm changing the name of Secret 12 from Secret 12 to Ultra 12.
[00:15:16.247 --> 00:15:18.128]  Now, I know how people are.
[00:15:18.128 --> 00:15:19.409]  They always love the original name.
[00:15:19.409 --> 00:15:20.050]  Hey, guess what?
[00:15:22.896 --> 00:15:30.519]  Fun little gimmick, when you peel off the label of Ultra 12 under it, it says Secret 12 Plus.
[00:15:30.519 --> 00:15:35.862]  Truth is, they'd already labeled it Secret 12 Plus, and we thought, people don't even know what it means when we say plus, that means more.
[00:15:35.862 --> 00:15:37.562]  Call it Ultra 12.
[00:15:37.562 --> 00:15:43.325]  And so, I put the new label on it, so it becomes kind of a gimmick we didn't intend, but it'll be called Ultra 12 after that.
[00:15:44.225 --> 00:15:45.127]  And it's amazing.

[00:15:53.096 --> 00:15:53.597]  Just.
[00:15:53.597 --> 00:15:54.017]  Twice.
[00:15:54.017 --> 00:15:54.838]  As strong.
[00:15:54.838 --> 00:15:55.539]  Highest quality.
[00:15:55.539 --> 00:15:56.460]  Metal Kaballaman.

[00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:34.954]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:34.954 --> 00:17:37.996]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:37.996 --> 00:17:43.940]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.723]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.723 --> 00:17:48.984]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:48.984 --> 00:17:49.984]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:49.984 --> 00:17:56.529]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.529 --> 00:17:57.970]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:03.814]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.814 --> 00:18:05.575]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.575 --> 00:18:16.863]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.623 --> 00:18:26.826]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.826 --> 00:18:32.768]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.768 --> 00:18:37.870]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.491]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.491 --> 00:18:42.191]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.191 --> 00:18:47.013]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[00:18:47.233 --> 00:18:52.197]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:54.839]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.839 --> 00:19:00.424]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.424 --> 00:19:02.666]  Stacy in the great state of Texas.
[00:19:03.763 --> 00:19:06.846]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[00:19:19.557 --> 00:19:25.524]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[00:19:25.524 --> 00:19:26.304]  I appreciate that.
[00:19:26.304 --> 00:19:27.906]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[00:19:27.906 --> 00:19:28.507]  Tell us about it.
[00:19:28.507 --> 00:19:29.288]  Well, it's really great.
[00:19:29.288 --> 00:19:31.089]  You know, it's like a multivitamin, I take it.
[00:19:31.089 --> 00:19:31.830]  It tastes good.
[00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.672]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:35.634]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[00:19:35.634 --> 00:19:39.118]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[00:19:39.138 --> 00:19:41.959]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[00:19:41.959 --> 00:19:43.720]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.801]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[00:19:45.801 --> 00:19:46.722]  So, yeah.
[00:19:46.722 --> 00:19:49.163]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[00:19:49.163 --> 00:19:51.984]  These are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[00:19:51.984 --> 00:19:53.125]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.206]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:19:54.206 --> 00:19:55.626]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:17.197 --> 00:20:20.879]  Oh, there's a war on for your mind, alright.
[00:20:20.879 --> 00:20:22.600]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.522]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:40.722]  And there's a war out there to keep you from expressing what you have to say in the new telecommunications digital town square of the world.
[00:20:40.722 --> 00:20:47.943]  In the future, everything's digital apps, digital systems, Facebook, Google is buying up almost every company.
[00:20:47.943 --> 00:20:56.965]  And now they're saying, if you don't tell the line with us, we're going to turn your app off and not let you call people.
[00:20:58.114 --> 00:21:05.711]  CNN's licking their lips like something out of a nightmare dystopia novel, but it's really here.
[00:21:07.102 --> 00:21:11.065]  Because we've acquiesced to their criminal racketeering.
[00:21:11.065 --> 00:21:13.828]  And so they're getting you all ready for the civil war they have planned.
[00:21:13.828 --> 00:21:20.753]  They already had planned, once Hillary was in office, it was going to be women against men, minorities against whites.
[00:21:20.753 --> 00:21:26.899]  So they still followed that whole divide-and-conquer playbook and strategy and that leg of the globalist program.
[00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:28.120]  They admit it all.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.964]  In WikiLeaks and public statements, you can see almost every Hollywood movie, TV shows, everywhere, white people are the devil, on and on and on.
[00:21:34.805 --> 00:21:35.525]  Men are bad.
[00:21:35.525 --> 00:21:36.946]  Women are in charge of everything.
[00:21:36.946 --> 00:21:40.627]  It's just an attack on the human community, period.
[00:21:40.627 --> 00:21:41.748]  Nobody's a winner here.
[00:21:41.748 --> 00:21:42.848]  We're all being targeted.
[00:21:42.848 --> 00:21:45.609]  Only the globalists think they're winners, ruling over us.
[00:21:45.609 --> 00:21:47.950]  But they themselves lose their humanity in the process.
[00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:52.732]  But see, they project their own hatred of themselves onto us and say, oh, humanity's obsolete.
[00:21:52.732 --> 00:21:54.853]  We're going to merge with the AI gods.
[00:21:56.479 --> 00:21:59.784]  That's the mainline religion of the crazy tech owners.
[00:21:59.784 --> 00:22:04.911]  And I guess when the average tech owner is worth like 50 billion dollars, there's about a dozen of them.
[00:22:04.911 --> 00:22:08.736]  They got a bunch of underlings worth a billion or so, a couple thousand of them.
[00:22:08.736 --> 00:22:11.179]  They're all taking a bunch of hallucinogenic drugs and everything else.
[00:22:11.179 --> 00:22:12.761]  They really believe they're God!
[00:22:13.837 --> 00:22:21.700]  And so, of course, we can tell 2.2 billion users at Facebook, don't you use that name of Voldemort Jones!
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.521]  Don't you say his name!
[00:22:23.521 --> 00:22:28.503]  People say, yes, sir, boss, how do I jump?
[00:22:28.503 --> 00:22:31.065]  And, of course, they're always going to remember the old goalposts.
[00:22:31.065 --> 00:22:42.470]  But what's coming next when Trump loses in 2020 because they steal the election and because they've cut the legs out from under him and the grassroots is unable to communicate with others and magnify the message?
[00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.090]  What's going to happen?
[00:22:44.312 --> 00:22:47.354]  They're going to plunge the nation into physical civil war.
[00:22:47.354 --> 00:22:53.279]  And in blue state areas first, they're going to start gun confiscation, which has already begun with this red flag rule.
[00:22:53.279 --> 00:22:58.003]  And here's Cory Booker saying, oh yeah, when we say they're illegal, you better turn them in or you're going to jail.
[00:22:58.003 --> 00:23:00.986]  Well, that means the SWAT teams are coming.
[00:23:00.986 --> 00:23:03.167]  I hear the train a coming.
[00:23:03.167 --> 00:23:05.289]  It's rolling round the bend.
[00:23:05.289 --> 00:23:08.992]  And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when.
[00:23:08.992 --> 00:23:13.496]  I'm stuck in police state America, and time keeps dragging on.
[00:23:14.875 --> 00:23:17.778]  And they just keep coming to get my guns.
[00:23:17.778 --> 00:23:20.340]  And they just keep coming to get my kids.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.643]  And they just keep coming with all their GMO.
[00:23:23.643 --> 00:23:26.626]  They just keep coming to kill the newborn babies.
[00:23:26.626 --> 00:23:28.828]  Because they're so liberal.
[00:23:28.828 --> 00:23:30.029]  They're so loving.
[00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:32.571]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:23:32.571 --> 00:23:35.434]  Let's go ahead and hear from Corey Crazy Ice Booker.
[00:23:38.174 --> 00:23:40.915]  And I have a record on dealing with gun violence.
[00:23:40.915 --> 00:23:46.336]  We did a lot of gun buybacks and even other creative ideas that I think we should have.
[00:23:46.336 --> 00:23:48.396]  Oh hit pause and start it over.
[00:23:48.396 --> 00:23:52.997]  Creative ideas, that's how they ban guns in over 100 countries.
[00:23:52.997 --> 00:24:00.078]  Is first they have buybacks to get you used to turning guns in, in the news, for all the sheeple to see these people lined up turning guns in.
[00:24:00.078 --> 00:24:01.919]  Like that's something you do, you know.
[00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:02.899]  They're bad, they're evil.
[00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:08.342]  And then they register them and then they confiscate them.
[00:24:08.342 --> 00:24:13.446]  Buybacks, registration, forced confiscation, and those usually aren't even buybacks.
[00:24:13.446 --> 00:24:19.610]  And then they SWAT team a few people like the real Crocodile Dundee and kill them at their house to scare everybody else into it.
[00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.072]  So just everything he says is a lie.
[00:24:22.072 --> 00:24:23.813]  Original ideas.
[00:24:23.813 --> 00:24:25.214]  Just everything he says is a lie.
[00:24:25.214 --> 00:24:26.195]  I'm Cory Booker.
[00:24:26.195 --> 00:24:27.456]  I'm a real innovator.
[00:24:27.456 --> 00:24:33.100]  I'm not a total puppet carrying out a global program under the UN Small Arms Treaty that Trump's about to pull out of.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.721]  I'm not following a UNESCO script.
[00:24:35.721 --> 00:24:36.861]  I'm original.
[00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:38.022]  I just came up with this.
[00:24:38.022 --> 00:24:39.362]  Here, let's hear it.
[00:24:39.362 --> 00:24:42.084]  And I have a record on dealing with gun violence.
[00:24:42.084 --> 00:24:45.705]  We did a lot of gun buybacks and even other creative ideas.
[00:24:45.705 --> 00:24:48.266]  I'm sorry.
[00:24:48.266 --> 00:24:49.527]  Dealing with gun violence.
[00:24:49.527 --> 00:24:55.930]  All the blue cities have the highest crime rates because that's you people run them with the narcotics and all the prostitutes and it's allowed to operate.
[00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.811]  The Democratic Party does the child trafficking and the human trafficking.
[00:24:58.811 --> 00:25:00.692]  It's all on record senatorial reports.
[00:25:02.898 --> 00:25:15.836]  So you're not dealing with gun violence, you're disarming the general public so only criminal have them, so that you can have criminal rule over the streets, because you're like the Penguin, or the Joker, but in the real world!
[00:25:15.836 --> 00:25:18.380]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.001]  Let's go back to him.
[00:25:22.777 --> 00:25:24.498]  When I'm President of the United States.
[00:25:24.498 --> 00:25:32.004]  The critical thing is, I think most Americans agree that these weapons of war should not be on our streets.
[00:25:32.004 --> 00:25:34.386]  But would you prosecute people?
[00:25:34.386 --> 00:25:36.048]  Do you support the government buying them back?
[00:25:36.048 --> 00:25:39.431]  And if not, potentially people could go to jail if they don't want to sell them back.
[00:25:39.431 --> 00:25:39.911]  Yes or no?
[00:25:40.291 --> 00:25:48.693]  Again, we should have a law that bans these weapons and we should have a reasonable period in which people can turn in these weapons.
[00:25:48.693 --> 00:25:56.235]  Right now, we have a nation that allows, in streets and communities like mine, these weapons that should not exist.
[00:25:56.235 --> 00:26:01.397]  Weapons that should not exist except in your bodyguards and your SWAT teams and your system.
[00:26:02.216 --> 00:26:04.698]  So just everything he says is a distortion or a lie.
[00:26:04.698 --> 00:26:05.819]  So here's the New York Times.
[00:26:05.819 --> 00:26:06.740]  At least they're being honest.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:11.304]  I've got a bunch of four-minute, three-minute clips of just Democrats saying, we're going to confiscate your guns.
[00:26:11.304 --> 00:26:12.385]  We're going to take them.
[00:26:12.385 --> 00:26:14.807]  Mr. and Mrs. America, get ready to turn them in.
[00:26:14.807 --> 00:26:20.712]  But in the past, they would lie about it and say, oh, that's not really our plan.
[00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:23.895]  Now, here's the New York Times.
[00:26:23.895 --> 00:26:26.117]  John Paul Stevens, repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:26:26.117 --> 00:26:27.839]  That's a Supreme Court justice.
[00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:28.179]  Repeal it.
[00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:34.475]  Repeal the Second Amendment, another New York Times article.
[00:26:34.475 --> 00:26:35.436]  Repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:26:35.436 --> 00:26:40.041]  It's all over the news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:40.041 --> 00:26:51.993]  So this is the corrupt elite that control the crapple areas, once great cities, still have some great areas, but are being fought on by Democrats in New York.
[00:26:52.992 --> 00:26:58.758]  Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, they confiscate the guns, they ban most of the guns.
[00:26:58.758 --> 00:27:01.200]  DC, all hell breaks loose.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.143]  They have the highest crime rates because criminals don't follow the rules.
[00:27:04.143 --> 00:27:11.970]  But like a third world nation, all the Democrats have their own armed guards that follow them around and they drive around in armored vehicles and they live in gated communities.
[00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.171]  But you don't.
[00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:16.935]  You, the average person, just get fed on so the criminals can break in your house.
[00:27:17.535 --> 00:27:22.961]  and steal your jewelry, and steal your computer, so they can go to a pawn shop and sell it to buy drugs.
[00:27:22.961 --> 00:27:28.686]  The Democrats, most Democrats at a high level, are narcotics traffickers.
[00:27:28.686 --> 00:27:34.372]  Most Democrats actually run smuggling operations, even child kidnapping rings.
[00:27:34.372 --> 00:27:36.714]  And it's all come out in the news.
[00:27:36.714 --> 00:27:37.095]  Obama.
[00:27:39.013 --> 00:27:41.994]  Smuggled tens of thousands of small children into the U.S.
[00:27:41.994 --> 00:27:44.094]  that disappeared and were used for sex slavery.
[00:27:44.094 --> 00:27:46.735]  Washington Post even reported that.
[00:27:46.735 --> 00:27:47.575]  Senate report.
[00:27:47.575 --> 00:27:49.075]  Where'd the kids go?
[00:27:49.075 --> 00:27:50.415]  It's a perfect way.
[00:27:50.415 --> 00:27:51.976]  Hillary got busted.
[00:27:51.976 --> 00:27:52.256]  U.N.
[00:27:52.256 --> 00:27:53.276]  report.
[00:27:53.276 --> 00:27:53.636]  The U.N.
[00:27:53.636 --> 00:27:54.476]  report on itself.
[00:27:54.476 --> 00:27:55.397]  AP reported.
[00:27:55.397 --> 00:27:56.917]  Tens of thousands of missing kids.
[00:27:56.917 --> 00:27:58.417]  Hundreds dead in Haiti.
[00:27:58.417 --> 00:28:01.698]  Her own top people caught smuggling kids in.
[00:28:01.698 --> 00:28:02.198]  Look into it.
[00:28:04.426 --> 00:28:05.806]  So that's the reality here.
[00:28:05.806 --> 00:28:09.327]  The truth is, crime rate has been dropping with guns since 1992.
[00:28:09.327 --> 00:28:20.829]  And it went down 59% on some numbers, 61% if you look at Professor Lott's numbers.
[00:28:20.829 --> 00:28:26.830]  So it went down 60% or so, and then it went back up about 10 points in the last four years, five years.
[00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.410]  There's been some crime going back up.
[00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.470]  Well, there it is.
[00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.911]  So some crime's gone back up, it's true.
[00:28:31.911 --> 00:28:32.891]  But nothing like it was.
[00:28:34.395 --> 00:28:37.058]  And that's the truth.
[00:28:37.058 --> 00:28:41.482]  61% and now it's back to about 50% less than it was.
[00:28:41.482 --> 00:28:45.686]  But the media creates the perception that it's going on everywhere.
[00:28:45.686 --> 00:28:52.172]  But they don't report on little kidnapped Mexican kids getting gang raped by Democrats at sex parties.
[00:28:52.172 --> 00:28:53.373]  Oh yeah, that's why they're pissed.
[00:28:53.373 --> 00:28:55.314]  I'm talking about their favorite thing.
[00:28:55.314 --> 00:28:56.536]  These are devil worshipers.
[00:28:56.536 --> 00:28:58.718]  They kill already born babies and they want to kill you.
[00:28:59.338 --> 00:29:02.022]  Everyone knows, even good people fall on hard times.
[00:29:02.022 --> 00:29:05.426]  Your credit cards get maxed out, and you get behind on your taxes.
[00:29:05.426 --> 00:29:10.112]  Unfortunately, the IRS is not as understanding, and they won't stop until they collect.
[00:29:10.112 --> 00:29:14.758]  They have the power to take your paycheck, freeze your bank accounts, even your home or business could be at risk.
[00:29:14.958 --> 00:29:18.300]  It's simply not worth it to take on the IRS by yourself.
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.902]  You need to call the experts at Optima Tax Relief.
[00:29:20.902 --> 00:29:23.624]  When you call, be sure to ask about the Fresh Start Initiative.

[00:30:00.365 --> 00:30:03.147]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[00:30:03.147 --> 00:30:09.392]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[00:30:09.392 --> 00:30:11.394]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[00:30:43.755 --> 00:30:44.335]  I think so.
[00:31:00.307 --> 00:31:04.213]  Brain Force Plus is a top-tier nootropic.
[00:31:04.213 --> 00:31:05.435]  Focus.
[00:31:05.435 --> 00:31:06.397]  Clarity.
[00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:07.318]  Energy.
[00:31:07.318 --> 00:31:12.807]  But instead of having a 7x markup, we have a 150% markup.
[00:31:12.807 --> 00:31:14.970]  Right now, it's massively discounted.

[00:31:22.233 --> 00:31:26.295]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.
[00:31:26.295 --> 00:31:28.996]  And that, of course, is Knockout, the ultimate sleep aid.

[00:32:05.345 --> 00:32:13.908]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:32:13.908 --> 00:32:16.889]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:32:16.889 --> 00:32:18.629]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:24.911]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[00:32:27.012 --> 00:32:32.334]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[00:32:32.334 --> 00:32:35.275]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[00:32:35.275 --> 00:32:38.877]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[00:32:38.877 --> 00:32:43.198]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:32:43.198 --> 00:32:45.019]  I've got two in my home.
[00:32:45.019 --> 00:32:51.101]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:32:51.101 --> 00:32:51.962]  Don't live
[00:32:52.782 --> 00:32:56.846]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[00:32:56.846 --> 00:33:03.312]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:33:03.312 --> 00:33:05.955]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.948 --> 00:33:25.813]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:25.813 --> 00:33:27.274]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:00.117 --> 00:34:04.401]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:34:04.401 --> 00:34:05.002]  to 3 p.m.
[00:34:05.002 --> 00:34:06.604]  Central.
[00:34:06.604 --> 00:34:10.428]  Paul Joseph Watson's gonna be here in the fourth hour, always informative.
[00:34:12.794 --> 00:34:22.778]  And Owen Froyer and one of our reporters, Bill Johnson, are out in Austin to test the waters on free speech.
[00:34:22.778 --> 00:34:28.181]  So wait for that today, live here on the radio slash simulcast TV transmission.
[00:34:28.181 --> 00:34:33.463]  And of course, the war room's at three o'clock central today, maybe not every weekday morning, 8 a.m.
[00:34:33.463 --> 00:34:37.325]  As you now see, I know you know this, there is a giant war
[00:34:38.513 --> 00:34:47.996]  To misrepresent what Infowars is, build a strawman, then destroy us by any means necessary, and then setting the precedent to take everybody else down.
[00:34:47.996 --> 00:34:58.639]  But we've been chosen for virtual annihilation because we are rebooting a very pure form of Western Americana Renaissance system.
[00:35:00.433 --> 00:35:08.176]  A wavelength, an energy force, a spirit that will counter and defeat the globalist cold-blooded system.
[00:35:08.176 --> 00:35:16.418]  Our hot-blooded, fire-breathing system is unstoppable if people pick up the spirit.
[00:35:16.418 --> 00:35:21.980]  But if they don't pick up the spirit that comes from God, they will be slaves.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.841]  Now here's the good news and the bad news.
[00:35:23.841 --> 00:35:27.462]  Rumors swirl about huge layoffs at CNN.
[00:35:28.973 --> 00:35:31.615]  But Brian Stelter denies.
[00:35:31.615 --> 00:35:38.540]  Well, if Brian Stelter tells you something, he lies even when the truth would serve him well.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:41.221]  Or better.
[00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:44.884]  But here's the deal.
[00:35:44.884 --> 00:35:52.369]  CNN and all the rest of the corporate horror media are shadows of their former selves, and now still shadows of that.
[00:35:52.369 --> 00:35:54.370]  So I'll break down the numbers on that.
[00:35:57.958 --> 00:35:59.299]  Good thing to get into.
[00:35:59.299 --> 00:36:02.320]  Very, very important.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.322]  Also, there's a big league politics article out that's important.
[00:36:05.322 --> 00:36:10.885]  Facebook notified mainstream media ahead of Infowars ban, showing how it was a giant PR rollout.
[00:36:10.885 --> 00:36:13.146]  Also, the famous saying, we're white supremacists.
[00:36:13.146 --> 00:36:17.548]  You know, if you go anywhere on the Internet.
[00:36:17.548 --> 00:36:18.109]  Anywhere on the Internet.
[00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:23.031]  Let me show people this article, if you can.
[00:36:23.031 --> 00:36:24.072]  If you go anywhere on the Internet,
[00:36:26.929 --> 00:36:29.930]  YouTube, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.531]  Anything to do with Infowars.
[00:36:31.531 --> 00:36:33.912]  Anything.
[00:36:33.912 --> 00:36:35.853]  Anything.
[00:36:35.853 --> 00:36:46.597]  A third of the comments, many of them left as spam, are that Alex Jones is a Zionist shill who supports the censorship of people that are against Israel.
[00:36:48.851 --> 00:36:51.113]  Now, I'm not here talking about myself to defend myself.
[00:36:51.113 --> 00:36:55.876]  I'm here trying to reach out to people that aren't bots and who aren't mentally ill.
[00:36:55.876 --> 00:37:08.566]  I don't support censorship against anybody, and I stood up against censorship of people that don't like Israel, like David Duke and Minister Farrakhan.
[00:37:08.566 --> 00:37:11.568]  And I'm on record.
[00:37:11.568 --> 00:37:13.449]  So, that's not true.
[00:37:13.449 --> 00:37:15.291]  So see, that's mental illness.
[00:37:15.291 --> 00:37:15.651]  That's A.
[00:37:21.178 --> 00:37:28.407]  I don't hardly think about Israel except when I constantly, like the little one-trick pony, see people say this.
[00:37:28.407 --> 00:37:32.212]  You know how big a headache that gives me?
[00:37:32.212 --> 00:37:33.915]  When I study real geopolitical forces.
[00:37:35.492 --> 00:37:48.307]  And the Chai comms in the EU, and Latin America collapsing, and the mega banks in Hollywood, and of course Israel's got a big part of that, and of course there's a lot of leftist Jews that are involved with some of the big leftist groups trying to end free speech, and all that.
[00:37:48.307 --> 00:37:56.116]  And I'm just at war with corruption, whether it's Chai comms, or whether it's leftist Jews, or whether it's leftist Germans, or leftist Russians.
[00:37:58.021 --> 00:38:02.024]  There are leftist globalists around the world who all support the same ideologies.
[00:38:02.024 --> 00:38:03.785]  Radical Islam's in league with it.
[00:38:03.785 --> 00:38:09.630]  And then there are nationalists and capitalists and free marketers and pro-Christians and pro-Renaissance.
[00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:11.931]  And that's who I am.
[00:38:11.931 --> 00:38:16.575]  So see, the proof is in the pudding of what I do.
[00:38:16.575 --> 00:38:20.858]  And I don't respond to all the anti-Semites and people because they hurt me.
[00:38:20.858 --> 00:38:24.521]  I respond to you because it's not logical.
[00:38:26.789 --> 00:38:31.572]  To say that I support censorship when I don't.
[00:38:31.572 --> 00:38:35.995]  And it's not logical, you know, without evidence.
[00:38:35.995 --> 00:38:41.158]  And it's not logical to say that I work for Israel when I don't.
[00:38:41.158 --> 00:38:49.343]  But then the reason I raise this today is, thousands of articles with the headlines.
[00:38:49.343 --> 00:38:51.544]  Thousands.
[00:38:51.544 --> 00:38:53.225]  All over the world.
[00:38:53.225 --> 00:38:56.207]  Alex Jones removed with other anti-Semites.
[00:38:57.805 --> 00:39:01.086]  From Facebook.
[00:39:01.086 --> 00:39:02.847]  And they say David Duke was removed.
[00:39:02.847 --> 00:39:05.647]  He wasn't removed off YouTube or all those places.
[00:39:05.647 --> 00:39:07.508]  And that's a point I've made.
[00:39:07.508 --> 00:39:13.970]  I've said, why is David Duke and all these people able to operate on YouTube?
[00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:15.971]  And I say they should be able to.
[00:39:15.971 --> 00:39:19.012]  But then I'm not able to.
[00:39:19.012 --> 00:39:23.033]  And then I have the white supremacist literally obsessed with me and hating me.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.361]  And then I've got the left always saying I'm a white supremacist.
[00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:30.561]  It's just mental illness.
[00:39:30.561 --> 00:39:35.402]  It's not real.
[00:39:35.402 --> 00:39:44.204]  But you see, people that aren't really intellectual or informed, if they just, if you're on the left, you call somebody a Nazi.
[00:39:44.204 --> 00:39:54.426]  And if you're on the whatever Islam slash weird left wing, right wing, Jews run everything,
[00:39:55.737 --> 00:40:01.881]  Tangent, it's just easy to have a unified field theory that everything is Jews.
[00:40:01.881 --> 00:40:12.008]  You know, if you really want to get down to brass tacks, it's a lot of the groups trying to take us down are captained by leftist Jews.
[00:40:12.008 --> 00:40:15.730]  And man, they call me a Nazi and they're coming after me.
[00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:16.671]  They don't come after you.
[00:40:16.671 --> 00:40:17.851]  They don't take you off the Internet.
[00:40:17.851 --> 00:40:18.592]  They take me off.
[00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:19.831]  Because you know what?
[00:40:19.831 --> 00:40:23.313]  The Democratic Party is teaching racial division for control and power.
[00:40:23.313 --> 00:40:25.215]  They admit it in the WikiLeaks and their own statements.
[00:40:25.215 --> 00:40:28.097]  And I'm trying to create unity.
[00:40:28.097 --> 00:40:35.983]  I'm trying to bring people together, no matter what color they are or where they came from, around free market and good ideas and real open society.
[00:40:35.983 --> 00:40:40.166]  You know, you notice George Soros calls his group the Open Society Foundation because it's the opposite.
[00:40:40.166 --> 00:40:44.410]  He wants closed, controlled societies with authoritarianism where they control speech.
[00:40:45.856 --> 00:40:52.618]  And man, I've got him and all these other groups coming after me, financing lawsuits against me, breathing down my neck.
[00:40:52.618 --> 00:40:53.978]  And yeah, George Soros is a Jew.
[00:40:53.978 --> 00:40:58.600]  And he's a Jew that collaborated for Hitler.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.440]  So see how that works?
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:11.603]  It doesn't make any sense to just pull back and say Jews are all bad, or to say the Catholics are all bad, or to say the Masons are all bad, or to say that's mental illness.
[00:41:11.603 --> 00:41:13.584]  That's stupid.
[00:41:13.584 --> 00:41:14.444]  That's dumb.
[00:41:16.437 --> 00:41:23.022]  And you know, three years ago I went and met with Louis Farrakhan.
[00:41:23.022 --> 00:41:25.624]  Nation of Islam reached out.
[00:41:25.624 --> 00:41:26.785]  We reached out to them years before.
[00:41:28.516 --> 00:41:28.616]  And
[00:41:47.003 --> 00:41:50.684]  I've said some things that were probably taken out of context I didn't mean years ago.
[00:41:50.684 --> 00:42:03.209]  I realize the globals want a race war now, and there's still a lot of racism on both sides, but Islam needs a reformation, and so do other groups, and we need to come together, because he said, I really think Trump's probably good, but I don't know how to get my constituents to understand it.
[00:42:03.209 --> 00:42:04.730]  He's tried that.
[00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:05.690]  Where he said, isn't it funny?
[00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.551]  Trump's getting rid of all our enemies.
[00:42:08.551 --> 00:42:11.052]  Which is true.
[00:42:11.052 --> 00:42:14.714]  So see, I actually went and met with Farrakhan, I'm going to probably meet with him again soon,
[00:42:15.896 --> 00:42:21.262]  Because he invited me to meet with him again, but I was in the middle of a divorce and had all this crazy stuff and I couldn't even leave town when he wanted to meet.
[00:42:21.262 --> 00:42:24.145]  I had a trial coming up for custody of my kids, so I couldn't come then.
[00:42:24.145 --> 00:42:27.368]  So I've reached out, I want to speak to him again.
[00:42:27.368 --> 00:42:29.831]  But, think about that.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:38.501]  Now, when I tried to have David Duke on, to try to get him to go, hey, eugenics is hurting everybody, hey, abortion's hurting everybody, hey, everybody's being targeted by this.
[00:42:38.501 --> 00:42:42.942]  He just wanted to do talking points and score points on me, and I wasn't trying to score points, man.
[00:42:42.942 --> 00:42:45.283]  People go, oh, David Duke kicked your ass in that debate.
[00:42:45.283 --> 00:42:48.423]  I wasn't trying to debate David Duke.
[00:42:48.423 --> 00:42:54.784]  I was trying to talk about other issues other than what color somebody is.
[00:42:54.784 --> 00:42:55.824]  That's it.
[00:42:55.824 --> 00:42:57.665]  So the interview went nowhere.
[00:42:57.665 --> 00:42:58.225]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:58.225 --> 00:42:58.625]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:03.393]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:43:03.393 --> 00:43:06.675]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:43:06.675 --> 00:43:12.938]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:43:12.938 --> 00:43:15.720]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.284]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:43:20.284 --> 00:43:26.751]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:43:26.751 --> 00:43:31.716]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:43:32.458 --> 00:43:36.381]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:43:36.381 --> 00:43:43.586]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:43:43.586 --> 00:43:48.810]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:54.514]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:43:54.514 --> 00:43:58.477]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:44:00.458 --> 00:44:01.859]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:44:01.859 --> 00:44:03.780]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:04.380]  It is.
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:09.264]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:44:09.264 --> 00:44:10.604]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:44:10.604 --> 00:44:12.406]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:44:12.406 --> 00:44:14.907]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:44:14.907 --> 00:44:18.009]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[00:44:18.009 --> 00:44:19.370]  You've got the children's.
[00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:20.491]  You've got the adults.
[00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:21.491]  You've got the krill oil.
[00:44:21.491 --> 00:44:24.873]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[00:44:24.873 --> 00:44:27.235]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[00:44:27.455 --> 00:44:28.796]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[00:44:28.796 --> 00:44:29.677]  And I'm sorry.
[00:44:29.677 --> 00:44:30.658]  You want something like this?
[00:44:30.658 --> 00:44:31.618]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:44:31.618 --> 00:44:33.540]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.140]  It's so good.
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:34.761]  In my view.
[00:44:34.761 --> 00:44:36.822]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:44:36.822 --> 00:44:43.187]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:44:43.187 --> 00:44:47.751]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:44:50.714 --> 00:44:56.738]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:44:56.738 --> 00:44:57.439]  I just can't do it!
[00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:06.282]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[00:47:03.366 --> 00:47:06.028]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:31.297 --> 00:47:36.941]  From the front lines of the information war, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:38.302]  I'm your host.
[00:47:38.302 --> 00:47:52.791]  Well, if you were wondering, when you tune in on the radio or watching on television, how Joe Biden would come back from the hundreds of videos of him bizarrely groping children and hundreds of videos of him bizarrely groping women.
[00:47:53.752 --> 00:48:00.758]  Grabbing women in restaurants, pulling them down on his lap, running his hands through their hair, sniffing their ear, sniffing their hair.
[00:48:00.758 --> 00:48:04.981]  I mean, does this guy run a swingers club or something?
[00:48:04.981 --> 00:48:11.186]  And then the grabbing the kids and rubbing their necks and whispering in their ears and rubbing his torso into them.
[00:48:11.186 --> 00:48:14.509]  Hundreds of people have gone public.
[00:48:14.509 --> 00:48:17.331]  So, Creepy Joe, how's he going to come back from that?
[00:48:17.331 --> 00:48:22.836]  Well, he's got a way now that he says he's able to come back from it.
[00:48:23.581 --> 00:48:27.105]  We're gonna tell you about that here in just a moment.
[00:48:27.105 --> 00:48:33.011]  And I'm gonna put the phones up after that in the next two hours ahead of Paul Joseph Watson joining us.
[00:48:33.011 --> 00:48:33.792]  But before I get to that...
[00:48:36.178 --> 00:48:38.099]  The cavalry is here.
[00:48:38.099 --> 00:48:48.046]  You know, the last four months, InfoWars five months, has been in the red because of them cutting off our ability to even sponsor and sell our products outside of our radio and TV show.
[00:48:48.046 --> 00:48:54.290]  Our products are so popular, so highly rated, they sell well on the internet, on other sites, that that's getting blocked.
[00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:58.973]  We're having to pay for our own bandwidth, we're having to do everything ourselves, build our own infrastructure.
[00:48:58.973 --> 00:48:59.513]  It's been hard.
[00:49:00.774 --> 00:49:09.718]  We did an analysis, and we're like, yeah, we've been sold out of Secret 12, which is super high-quality methylcobalamin.
[00:49:09.718 --> 00:49:11.439]  Just does incredible things for the body.
[00:49:11.439 --> 00:49:13.440]  You have to have B12 to live.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:21.903]  And especially northern Europeans, Japanese are similar in that genetic trait, and other groups cannot absorb vitamin B12.
[00:49:21.903 --> 00:49:27.706]  So I went in separately since I was selling Secret 12, the highest rated in the country, private label by us.
[00:49:29.056 --> 00:49:34.618]  They've had BuzzFeed do a test and say, well, theirs is pure, but this is the best brand, and it was who we're private labeling.
[00:49:34.618 --> 00:49:37.420]  Well, we've now done that again, but made it twice as strong.
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:51.946]  I'll tell you about it in a moment, but I went in for my 40-year-old checkup five years ago, and at this nice clinic with a doctor that's a fan, he said, do you want to do genetic testing to see what you have proclivity for?
[00:49:51.946 --> 00:49:53.947]  And I said, no, no, I don't want to do it.
[00:49:53.947 --> 00:49:56.048]  Then about a year ago, I did it.
[00:49:56.048 --> 00:49:57.048]  It was a couple thousand dollars.
[00:49:57.048 --> 00:49:58.509]  This wasn't just my genetic background.
[00:49:59.949 --> 00:50:01.690]  I'd already done that years ago and knew what it was.
[00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:02.731]  I ought to publish that.
[00:50:02.731 --> 00:50:04.472]  Pretty interesting.
[00:50:04.472 --> 00:50:06.294]  If you believe me, I'm quite a bit Neanderthal.
[00:50:06.294 --> 00:50:06.974]  I'm proud of that.
[00:50:06.974 --> 00:50:08.255]  They're supposedly psychic.
[00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:15.981]  But expanding on that, I'm there, and a few months later, it comes in.
[00:50:15.981 --> 00:50:20.043]  So I went in for an hour with the doctor and went over what it all meant.
[00:50:20.043 --> 00:50:20.824]  Later, I went and looked it up.
[00:50:20.824 --> 00:50:22.265]  I didn't just believe him.
[00:50:22.265 --> 00:50:26.028]  And sure enough, because I'm a Northern European, almost completely other than some Native American,
[00:50:28.243 --> 00:50:33.807]  I cannot absorb, I have double jeans turned off for B12.
[00:50:33.807 --> 00:50:44.114]  And he was like, automatically, he's like, you need prescriptions for methylcobalamin injected twice a week into your stomach fat.
[00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:48.472]  And incredible what it does.
[00:50:48.472 --> 00:50:50.413]  If you can get it from a doctor, it's the same stuff we have.
[00:50:50.413 --> 00:50:51.073]  Don't inject this.
[00:50:51.073 --> 00:50:55.776]  It's not labeled for that, but basically it comes from the same place, the same thing.
[00:50:55.776 --> 00:50:59.619]  But again, those obviously with injection are another type of container, so don't inject this.
[00:50:59.619 --> 00:51:01.460]  It's front of the tongue.
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:09.304]  You get, the doctor said, depending on your genetics, when you inject it, something like 50% or more upload in your body.
[00:51:09.304 --> 00:51:10.445]  It's incredible.
[00:51:10.445 --> 00:51:13.087]  And by the way, that's what people get cancer, especially northern Europeans,
[00:51:14.762 --> 00:51:23.006]  Folks in Minnesota, mainly northern Europeans, they have one of the highest cancer rates in the country, different types of cancer, because if B12 goes out, you can't absorb it, you're bye-bye.
[00:51:23.006 --> 00:51:30.550]  B12 is only really naturally in some things like seal meat or things like mushrooms.
[00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:38.894]  But still, as you get older, you go from being able to absorb, the doctor told me, 3% if you're a northern European, to 1% or less.
[00:51:38.894 --> 00:51:39.855]  What happens under the tongue?
[00:51:40.657 --> 00:51:45.258]  Depending on the study, as high as 10%, all those blood vessels.
[00:51:45.258 --> 00:51:48.619]  So you take it, you put it under your tongue.
[00:51:48.619 --> 00:51:51.860]  It's good for children and very important for over 40s.
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:53.580]  And you put it under your tongue for about a minute.
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.281]  And the longer you can do it, the better.
[00:51:55.281 --> 00:52:02.543]  Because if you just drink it down, you don't get that much absorption in your intestines, in your stomach, in your upper and lower intestine.
[00:52:02.543 --> 00:52:03.543]  Of course, your stomach above that.
[00:52:04.787 --> 00:52:10.511]  So what I'm getting at here is B12, just like clean iodine, is essential.
[00:52:10.511 --> 00:52:14.374]  Just like oxygen, just like water.
[00:52:14.374 --> 00:52:17.997]  And so many types you go to the store are synthetic.
[00:52:17.997 --> 00:52:19.958]  They're not absorbable by the body.
[00:52:19.958 --> 00:52:24.822]  You take these pills and it doesn't do almost anything.
[00:52:24.822 --> 00:52:27.283]  If you're African American, you absorb a lot of it.
[00:52:27.283 --> 00:52:31.046]  If you have some of those backgrounds.
[00:52:31.046 --> 00:52:31.947]  But white people,
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.782]  Because we are a mutation.
[00:52:35.782 --> 00:52:40.206]  Redheads are a mutation of a mutation.
[00:52:40.206 --> 00:52:41.828]  They're just genetic facts.
[00:52:41.828 --> 00:52:43.589]  And it doesn't mean a mutation is bad.
[00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:46.151]  Just the point is that it's a mutation of a mutation.
[00:52:46.151 --> 00:52:48.093]  And so there's little quirks and things.
[00:52:48.093 --> 00:52:50.135]  Like black people can't drink fluoride.
[00:52:52.096 --> 00:52:53.477]  Four to five times worse for them.
[00:52:53.477 --> 00:52:54.638]  It's already super deadly.
[00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:55.259]  There's differences.
[00:52:55.259 --> 00:52:57.721]  Humans are humans, but we have differences.
[00:52:57.721 --> 00:52:59.202]  It's like Native Americans are well-known.
[00:52:59.202 --> 00:53:02.765]  They can't drink or eat a lot of sugar, or they get diabetes easier than anybody else.
[00:53:02.765 --> 00:53:07.108]  You drive down the street, my God, half the Mexicans you see sometimes have got their legs cut off.
[00:53:07.108 --> 00:53:08.789]  It's very sad.
[00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:11.231]  This is the reality of genetics, folks.
[00:53:11.231 --> 00:53:15.155]  Hispanics can't have a bunch of sugar, and white people better get B12.
[00:53:15.155 --> 00:53:17.697]  I mean, this is how the world works, and everybody needs
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:24.803]  Basic things like vitamin C, basic things like good iodine, but I'm digressing.
[00:53:24.803 --> 00:53:37.230]  So what happened is, I said, I want to come out with Secret 12 Plus, even stronger, because a new formulation came out, we can make it even stronger, in the same bottle.
[00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:38.711]  And it didn't cost even that much more.
[00:53:40.086 --> 00:53:44.050]  And by law, you have to call it something else once you change the formula.
[00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:51.176]  So we called it plus, but then we got data in, we're starting to finally do marketing data, you know, we have to, usually I just went by the seat of my pants.
[00:53:51.176 --> 00:53:54.619]  I'm just giving you the inside baseball here.
[00:53:54.619 --> 00:53:59.643]  That people, for some reason, don't get plus means more or better, which it really does.
[00:53:59.643 --> 00:54:02.145]  It'd just be better to call it something completely different.
[00:54:02.145 --> 00:54:05.308]  So I said, all right, and I told the Rabbits folks, call it ultra 12.
[00:54:06.497 --> 00:54:10.259]  Twice as much Methylcobalamin, twice as strong, for close to the same price.
[00:54:10.259 --> 00:54:13.000]  We're discounting it for the original price of Secret 12 right now.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.981]  50% off at InfoWartore.com.
[00:54:15.981 --> 00:54:28.406]  And there were mix-ups, and so they'd already labeled it with this beautiful Secret 12 Plus label, and they said, do you want us to pay $5,000 for the factory to take those back off?
[00:54:28.406 --> 00:54:30.766]  I said, no, just stick the new label over it.
[00:54:30.766 --> 00:54:31.647]  But it's kind of cool.
[00:54:32.705 --> 00:54:36.626]  Because you could peel it off and then it's Secret 12 Plus under it.
[00:54:36.626 --> 00:54:38.267]  I think that's a better label.
[00:54:38.267 --> 00:54:39.968]  We might have a vote on the site in a few weeks.
[00:54:39.968 --> 00:54:44.029]  Do you like the name Secret 12 Plus or do you like Ultra 12 better?
[00:54:44.029 --> 00:54:48.911]  The point is, it's amazing, you need it, it's awesome, and it's the absolute go-to.
[00:54:48.911 --> 00:54:51.212]  By the way, it tastes super sweet.
[00:54:51.212 --> 00:54:54.333]  It's nothing but pure methylcobalamin.
[00:54:54.333 --> 00:54:57.794]  That's what B12 in its real form tastes like.
[00:54:57.794 --> 00:55:00.255]  It's a reddish, beautiful, almost purple,
[00:55:01.195 --> 00:55:02.736]  I don't know what color it is.
[00:55:02.736 --> 00:55:03.836]  It's just an amazing color.
[00:55:03.836 --> 00:55:04.557]  It has its own.
[00:55:04.557 --> 00:55:07.598]  Maybe do a document cam shot for TV viewers.
[00:55:07.598 --> 00:55:08.319]  It's got its own.
[00:55:08.319 --> 00:55:12.601]  Look at that color.
[00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:13.762]  It's got its own.
[00:55:13.762 --> 00:55:16.243]  You've never seen a red like that.
[00:55:16.243 --> 00:55:18.664]  There's no coloring in that.
[00:55:18.664 --> 00:55:20.385]  There's nothing on there that's got that red color.
[00:55:20.385 --> 00:55:22.026]  I mean, you've got to see it for yourself.
[00:55:22.026 --> 00:55:23.106]  It's just amazing.
[00:55:26.714 --> 00:55:28.035]  It's incredible.
[00:55:28.035 --> 00:55:35.201]  And again, when I forget about this, and when I forget about taking the products, I feel like crap.
[00:55:35.201 --> 00:55:36.863]  But when I take it, I feel great.
[00:55:36.863 --> 00:55:39.785]  So get your X2 in a free bottle of X3 right now.
[00:55:39.785 --> 00:55:46.371]  Get the new Secret 12 Plus, or as it's known, Ultra 12 for 50% off at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:55:46.371 --> 00:55:54.298]  And for your wife, your husband, your family, for people that are out working in the fields, truck drivers, police officers, especially high stress folks, this is way better than an energy drink for me.
[00:55:55.302 --> 00:55:59.670]  And you take it with something like a turbo force or a brain force, it just makes it all better.
[00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:03.496]  But just experience this, it's right out of mother nature, folks.
[00:56:03.496 --> 00:56:04.538]  That's pure B12.
[00:56:04.538 --> 00:56:04.878]  Look at that.
[00:56:06.024 --> 00:56:07.225]  You just gotta experience it yourself.
[00:56:07.225 --> 00:56:08.006]  So beautiful.
[00:56:08.006 --> 00:56:09.527]  Show amazing.
[00:56:09.527 --> 00:56:17.333]  All right, I'll get into Joe Biden when we come back, but let me just give you the meat and potatoes right now, and then I'll play the clip showing him doing all the groping and all the bizarreness.
[00:56:17.333 --> 00:56:22.297]  Joe Biden says grandson asked him about internet meme accusing him of molesting a child.
[00:56:22.297 --> 00:56:25.680]  So his grandson asked him, are you a child molester, basically, he says.
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:31.985]  And he goes, oh, see, it was my son's funeral, and I was putting my hands and rubbing on my grandson.
[00:56:31.985 --> 00:56:34.287]  Still in the video, a little weird how he does it.
[00:56:35.131 --> 00:56:39.393]  I mean, I get kissing a baby's cheek or rubbing him on the hair or whatever, but he does it to everybody.
[00:56:39.393 --> 00:56:39.813]  It's weird.
[00:56:39.813 --> 00:56:41.414]  He does it to women, you name it.
[00:56:41.414 --> 00:56:46.576]  So he's trying to divert off on his grandson, him groping on his grandson, which I guess isn't groping with your grandson.
[00:56:46.576 --> 00:56:47.696]  I guess it's a funeral for your son.
[00:56:47.696 --> 00:56:49.397]  But he's trying to change the subject.
[00:56:49.397 --> 00:56:51.018]  So that was his grandson.
[00:56:51.018 --> 00:56:54.519]  No, that wasn't his grandson in all of these videos.
[00:56:54.519 --> 00:57:00.222]  Yes, that's him in there, grabbing him under the jaw and controlling him up.
[00:57:00.222 --> 00:57:02.422]  My kids wouldn't like it if I did that.
[00:57:02.422 --> 00:57:03.383]  My two-year-old daughter.
[00:57:04.844 --> 00:57:11.068]  I mean, she loves me when she wants to come over and talk to me or hug on me, but when she's with mama or something, this morning I came over to kiss her and she went, mm, mama.
[00:57:11.068 --> 00:57:17.292]  And the point is, if I grabbed her by the jaw and pulled her towards me, she'd slap me.
[00:57:17.292 --> 00:57:19.353]  But see, it's all about power with this guy.
[00:57:19.353 --> 00:57:22.395]  Let's go out to break for TV viewers with his real grubbing of children.
[00:57:22.395 --> 00:57:24.376]  Here it is.
[00:57:24.376 --> 00:57:26.657]  Troll some of that video for TV viewers.
[00:57:26.657 --> 00:57:32.601]  And again, radio listeners will post it up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[00:57:33.911 --> 00:57:35.733]  But I gotta tell you, the cavalry's here.
[00:57:35.733 --> 00:57:41.178]  People are going crazy over the new product, Ultra 12.
[00:57:41.178 --> 00:57:43.260]  At this rate, good lord, it'll be sold out in a month.
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:44.621]  But I tell you, people love it.
[00:57:44.621 --> 00:57:45.743]  It's fun in our operation.
[00:57:45.743 --> 00:57:47.104]  So thank you all for ordering.
[00:57:47.104 --> 00:57:47.885]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:50.154 --> 00:57:56.918]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[00:57:56.918 --> 00:58:00.580]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.201]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[00:58:02.201 --> 00:58:04.902]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[00:58:04.902 --> 00:58:06.383]  You're our only sponsors.
[00:58:06.383 --> 00:58:12.867]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.

[00:59:46.531 --> 00:59:53.336]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:53.336 --> 00:59:55.978]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.179 --> 01:00:12.643]  Mark Geiss is about to knock it out of the park again, that dirty American.
[01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:14.905]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.905 --> 01:00:27.033]  That's right, that dirty American Mark Geiss has really been thumbing his nose on Twitter and YouTube and Facebook, defending my free speech, knowing anybody that does it at his level gets vaporized.
[01:00:27.033 --> 01:00:30.876]  He's acting like that six-foot-four red-blooded American he is!
[01:00:30.876 --> 01:00:34.899]  He's standing up against tyrants with a spirit that actually founded this country!
[01:00:35.672 --> 01:00:40.295]  What if other people start doing what he's doing?
[01:00:40.295 --> 01:00:48.639]  Over the weekend, President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice and defended him after Facebook banned him for being a dangerous individual.
[01:00:48.639 --> 01:00:56.744]  He also retweeted Lauren Southern and a brief video by InfoWars' Millie Weaver showing her interviewing a bunch of black people who love President Trump.
[01:00:56.744 --> 01:00:58.925]  As you can imagine, social media's hall monitor
[01:01:00.986 --> 01:01:08.589]  A big move by Facebook, banning several accounts, and now there's new blowback from the Commander-in-Chief.
[01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:18.274]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:23.416]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as InfoWars and sharing videos from Republicans.
[01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:28.852]  Infowars, of course, is that web show, website, led by rageaholics Alex Jones.
[01:01:54.369 --> 01:01:58.451]  He was questioning why these news organizations have the ability to be on Twitter.
[01:01:58.451 --> 01:01:59.592]  Why are they not banned?
[01:01:59.592 --> 01:01:59.932]  Right.
[01:01:59.932 --> 01:02:03.033]  While saying that the Infowars should be reinstated.
[01:02:03.033 --> 01:02:04.214]  It's nuts.
[01:02:04.214 --> 01:02:11.858]  Well, CNN is the biggest purveyor of conspiracy theories and hatred in America, so if Facebook's gonna be fair, maybe you should be banned too.
[01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:22.864]  I did make a mistake in last week's video talking about this latest purge when I said that news reports from CNN and other outlets came out a few minutes before they were actually banned.
[01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:26.566]  It turns out that they came out an hour before they were banned.
[01:02:26.566 --> 01:02:32.589]  Once again, CNN's Oliver Darcy was personally working with the tech companies to facilitate the ban.
[01:02:33.169 --> 01:02:41.715]  And had his article already written and ready to go for the moment that they were banned, but he made a mistake and published it an hour early.
[01:02:41.715 --> 01:02:52.482]  Here he is admitting that he's also trying to determine whether or not Alex Jones uses WhatsApp, the text messaging application, which is also owned by Facebook, so he could get him banned over there too.
[01:02:52.862 --> 01:03:00.611]  Now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:12.905]  I checked in also to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook, and a spokesperson cannot say immediately because it's, I guess, unclear whether some of these people have WhatsApp accounts, according to the spokesperson.
[01:03:13.505 --> 01:03:15.086]  All right, but we know you'll continue to check on it.
[01:03:15.086 --> 01:03:16.007]  Oliver Darcy, good to see you.
[01:03:16.007 --> 01:03:16.727]  Thank you.
[01:03:16.727 --> 01:03:17.608]  Yes, thank you.
[01:03:17.608 --> 01:03:24.992]  I also checked with Costco to see if they would be banning Alex Jones's membership because we wouldn't want someone like him to be able to eat, now would we?
[01:03:24.992 --> 01:03:30.536]  Of course, CNN's Anna Navarro, the fake Republican commentator, is thrilled with the new censorship.
[01:03:30.536 --> 01:03:32.077]  I have no issue with it at all.
[01:03:32.077 --> 01:03:33.178]  I want them shut down.
[01:03:33.178 --> 01:03:34.138]  I want them silenced.
[01:03:34.138 --> 01:03:34.959]  I want them muted.
[01:03:34.959 --> 01:03:37.040]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.121]  I want them shut down.
[01:03:38.121 --> 01:03:39.081]  I want them silenced.
[01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:39.922]  I want them muted.
[01:03:39.922 --> 01:03:41.723]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:03:41.943 --> 01:04:01.443]  While Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, and others aren't allowed to have a Facebook page anymore because they're considered to be dangerous individuals, Facebook doesn't have a problem allowing the Muslim Brotherhood to have an official page, which has been designated a terrorist organization in multiple countries.
[01:04:01.883 --> 01:04:18.527]  There are also people saying that they're having photos taken down off of their Instagram account for violating the community standards because those pictures include those individuals having met with some of the people who apparently you're not supposed to even show pictures of online anymore.
[01:04:18.527 --> 01:04:30.050]  Rapper Snoop Dogg's upset about the latest round of censorship because included in this latest purge was Louis Farrakhan to try to give the impression that it wasn't just conservatives being censored.
[01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:31.050]  Facebook and Instagram?
[01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:36.534]  How the f**k y'all gonna ban Minister Louis Farrakhan for putting truth out there?
[01:04:36.534 --> 01:04:37.415]  I stand with him.
[01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:38.315]  I'm with him.
[01:04:38.315 --> 01:04:40.217]  Ban me, motherf**ker.
[01:04:40.217 --> 01:04:42.038]  Ban me.
[01:04:42.038 --> 01:04:44.440]  Because I'm gonna keep posting this s**t. Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.082]  The full reports at MarkDice.com.
[01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:48.344]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[01:04:48.344 --> 01:04:49.104]  Stay with us.
[01:04:49.104 --> 01:04:51.526]  Big Hour 2 starts right now.
[01:04:51.526 --> 01:04:53.528]  Please spread the links at local radio stations.
[01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:00.891]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:05:00.891 --> 01:05:07.495]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:05:07.495 --> 01:05:11.978]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[01:05:11.978 --> 01:05:17.962]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild anchovy fish oil,
[01:05:18.462 --> 01:05:24.943]  Ultra-purified krill oil and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[01:05:24.943 --> 01:05:36.925]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[01:05:36.925 --> 01:05:46.167]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[01:05:46.767 --> 01:05:51.091]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[01:05:51.091 --> 01:05:56.996]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWars Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:56.996 --> 01:06:04.963]  When I grow up, I want to relaunch America worldwide.
[01:06:04.963 --> 01:06:07.946]  I want to initiate Operation 1776.
[01:06:07.946 --> 01:06:12.109]  I want to take on the top globalists, and I want to win.
[01:06:19.827 --> 01:06:28.110]  We now take you live to the front lines of the Fortress on Fire!
[01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:34.593]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:34.593 --> 01:06:39.215]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:39.215 --> 01:06:46.038]  In 1943, the following directive was issued from party headquarters to all communists in the United States.
[01:06:46.038 --> 01:06:46.318]  It read,
[01:06:47.945 --> 01:07:03.138]  When certain obstructionists become too irritating, label them, after suitable build-ups, as fascist, or Nazi, or anti-Semitic, and use the prestige of anti-fascist and tolerance organizations to discredit them.
[01:07:03.138 --> 01:07:10.465]  In the public mind, constantly associate those who oppose us with those names which already have a bad smell.
[01:07:10.465 --> 01:07:15.449]  The association will, after enough repetition, become fact in the public mind.
[01:07:16.696 --> 01:07:18.698]  Why are they doing this now?
[01:07:18.698 --> 01:07:23.783]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[01:07:23.783 --> 01:07:32.551]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:07:32.551 --> 01:07:37.516]  Now that they kicked him off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[01:07:37.936 --> 01:07:41.717]  You have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[01:07:41.717 --> 01:07:50.560]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.101]  I have no issue with it at all.
[01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:53.201]  I want them shut down.
[01:07:53.201 --> 01:07:54.161]  I want them silenced.
[01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:54.981]  I want them muted.
[01:07:54.981 --> 01:07:58.142]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:07:58.142 --> 01:07:59.543]  I want them shut down.
[01:07:59.543 --> 01:08:01.103]  I want them silenced.
[01:08:01.103 --> 01:08:02.344]  I want them muted.
[01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:03.584]  But don't worry.
[01:08:03.584 --> 01:08:05.305]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:18.860]  Booze and ladies!
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:20.781]  We're an American band.
[01:08:20.781 --> 01:08:21.681]  They don't like that, do they?
[01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:22.102]  They're gloveless.
[01:08:23.314 --> 01:08:25.975]  They don't like the return of America.
[01:08:25.975 --> 01:08:32.838]  All of you amazing people, no matter what color you are or where you came from, you're red-blooded, you love liberty, you're not some chicken-neck globalist.
[01:08:32.838 --> 01:08:34.039]  You got a soul that loves freedom?
[01:08:34.039 --> 01:08:35.659]  We're brothers and sisters.
[01:08:35.659 --> 01:08:36.240]  And they know it.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.301]  And they can feel it.
[01:08:38.301 --> 01:08:45.664]  Brian Stelter and those View Harpies and all those other twits will always be scum.
[01:08:45.664 --> 01:08:47.665]  They'll always be weak.
[01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:50.166]  They'll always be trying to suppress better men.
[01:08:51.448 --> 01:08:55.912]  But as they say, they'll never get the best of better men.
[01:08:55.912 --> 01:08:57.794]  Let's go ahead and go to this little piece.
[01:08:57.794 --> 01:08:58.494]  It's a comedy piece.
[01:08:58.494 --> 01:08:59.395]  You know, I had this idea.
[01:08:59.395 --> 01:09:02.298]  We were in a I.T.
[01:09:02.298 --> 01:09:06.842]  writing meeting yesterday, and I said, you know, the globalists just want to dominate people.
[01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:11.165]  They want to, like, giant Jabba the Hutt sit on top of us and rape us.
[01:09:11.165 --> 01:09:18.432]  And Kent Daniels, one of our great writers, one of our great managers here, he said, you mean like sea lions raping penguins?
[01:09:20.098 --> 01:09:20.158]  I'm
[01:09:37.739 --> 01:09:40.661]  I don't want to say it's evil, but it's going viral on Twitter, viral on YouTube right now.
[01:09:40.661 --> 01:09:44.584]  It's titled on Infowars.com if you're a radio listener and want to see it.
[01:09:44.584 --> 01:09:45.125]  I'm going from memory.
[01:09:45.125 --> 01:09:45.565]  We can pull it up.
[01:09:45.565 --> 01:09:47.627]  It's on Infowars.com since last night.
[01:09:47.627 --> 01:09:50.909]  Video, Mark Zuckerberg rapes Americans' free speech.
[01:09:50.909 --> 01:09:52.230]  Hell, he rapes it worldwide.
[01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:57.494]  So it's Zuckerberg as a lion seal raping Mia Penguin.
[01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:59.976]  They put my head on a penguin.
[01:09:59.976 --> 01:10:01.397]  King penguins is what they're called.
[01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:02.939]  But what's very sad about this is
[01:10:04.643 --> 01:10:06.485]  It's so crazy because it's so funny.
[01:10:06.485 --> 01:10:07.605]  Not the raping.
[01:10:07.605 --> 01:10:10.868]  He put Brian Stelter and Oliver Darcy's heads on the albatrosses.
[01:10:11.772 --> 01:10:19.294]  They're just waiting for the seal to get, the seal to kill the penguin so they can eat its guts.
[01:10:19.294 --> 01:10:22.375]  That's what the birds do, eat the eyeballs and then pull the guts out.
[01:10:22.375 --> 01:10:23.496]  And that's how it is.
[01:10:23.496 --> 01:10:26.637]  I'm sitting here with Facebook on top of me, raping me.
[01:10:26.637 --> 01:10:29.217]  Because they didn't just kick me off, they said I'm a white supremacist while they did it.
[01:10:29.217 --> 01:10:36.680]  It's like, we're not just going to kick all your fans off and anybody supporting you off and say your name can only be said if it's attacked.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.260]  That's beyond 1984 if you believe this is happening.
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.781]  But that you're a white supremacist everywhere.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:44.641]  And that you're dangerous.
[01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:46.522]  So this is the crazy thing.
[01:10:46.522 --> 01:10:48.323]  It's on our own servers at Infowars.com.
[01:10:48.323 --> 01:10:50.945]  It's going crazy on Twitter right now.
[01:10:50.945 --> 01:10:53.466]  So let's go ahead and roll this for radio listeners.
[01:10:53.466 --> 01:10:55.107]  You can go find it at Infowars.com.
[01:10:55.107 --> 01:10:59.009]  But yes, I'm doing kind of a David Attenborough action here at the start.
[01:10:59.009 --> 01:10:59.289]  Here it is.
[01:11:00.249 --> 01:11:10.398]  And this shocking footage is even more painful when you see the albatrosses of CNN and other MSM outlets cheering on the rape.
[01:11:10.398 --> 01:11:20.747]  In fact, it's been found that these systems actually direct the monstrous CEO, Zuckerberg, against the free speech enemies and anyone that tries to not submit.
[01:11:21.508 --> 01:11:33.176]  But most sad of all is other penguins in the independent media simply looking up at the sky and ignoring the vicious rape of their own freedoms and birthright taking place right in front of them.
[01:11:37.677 --> 01:11:39.298]  We are in a complete war!
[01:11:39.298 --> 01:11:42.239]  And you idiots don't join with the Republic, you fools!
[01:11:42.239 --> 01:11:45.640]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.582]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:11:48.582 --> 01:11:56.025]  Yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[01:11:56.445 --> 01:12:00.668]  President Trump, please save the First Amendment!
[01:12:00.668 --> 01:12:04.371]  Please do the right thing and stand up against Big Tech!
[01:12:04.371 --> 01:12:07.454]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[01:12:07.454 --> 01:12:11.877]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[01:12:11.877 --> 01:12:13.478]  I want them shut down.
[01:12:13.478 --> 01:12:17.422]  We're losing the thread of the concepts that are important to this country.
[01:12:17.422 --> 01:12:21.385]  I don't like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak.
[01:12:21.385 --> 01:12:22.706]  Everybody gets to speak.
[01:12:22.706 --> 01:12:23.686]  I'm a bad person!
[01:12:23.686 --> 01:12:24.467]  I question things!
[01:12:24.467 --> 01:12:25.047]  I'm evil!
[01:12:25.047 --> 01:12:25.428]  I don't...
[01:12:30.123 --> 01:12:34.888]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[01:12:34.888 --> 01:12:36.089]  Alright folks, we're back live.
[01:12:36.089 --> 01:12:42.796]  I appreciate you joining us here on the transmission.
[01:12:42.796 --> 01:12:51.925]  I don't want to make myself the whole focus of this broadcast, but it's like when Rush Limbaugh said 12, 13 years ago,
[01:12:54.724 --> 01:13:02.727]  He said the NFL is pushing black guys into quarterback positions who aren't as good as part of political correctness.
[01:13:02.727 --> 01:13:04.388]  Now, that's his opinion.
[01:13:04.388 --> 01:13:07.829]  I'm not a big enough follower of the NFL and I don't have time to know if that's true.
[01:13:07.829 --> 01:13:08.530]  I really don't care.
[01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:11.631]  As long as they don't politicize the NFL, which they've done.
[01:13:11.631 --> 01:13:14.152]  But nobody can deny the NFL is like 80% black.
[01:13:14.152 --> 01:13:20.735]  So, I remember just when I was watching, they were in the news always pushing that.
[01:13:20.735 --> 01:13:23.616]  I don't care whether all the quarterbacks are black or none of them.
[01:13:24.735 --> 01:13:26.896]  But they tried to take Limbaugh off the air.
[01:13:26.896 --> 01:13:29.018]  They took most of his sponsors.
[01:13:29.018 --> 01:13:31.439]  And I'm a capitalist.
[01:13:31.439 --> 01:13:42.025]  And I thought, you know, Rush Limbaugh, with $12,000 a minute spots, when I knew good and well, even back then, my audience on radio was, you know, a third as big as his, on the internet, bigger than his.
[01:13:42.025 --> 01:13:47.008]  We were selling, like, $1,200 spots.
[01:13:47.008 --> 01:13:49.349]  When his spots went down to, like, $3,000, $4,000 a piece, I said, now that's more like it.
[01:13:52.216 --> 01:13:59.161]  So I said I'll run some ads for some of my films like Terror Storm, Exposing the Deep State, on Limbaugh's show.
[01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:03.684]  And I did that though because I thought, hey I'll get my money back, which I made some money.
[01:14:03.684 --> 01:14:06.746]  Not a lot, but it more than broke even.
[01:14:06.746 --> 01:14:09.348]  And I got to support Rush Limbaugh.
[01:14:09.348 --> 01:14:10.469]  See how that works?
[01:14:10.469 --> 01:14:20.076]  And even if I disagree with Rush Limbaugh on 90% of what he had to say, and I of course agree with him on about 95%, I would have advertised with him if it had been Bill Maher.
[01:14:21.297 --> 01:14:26.869]  And you know, I've had some guests on that have said some things about Bill Maher that I don't think have been proven.
[01:14:26.869 --> 01:14:27.550]  I think are wrong.
[01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:32.540]  And then I got a few phone calls from people that I know that know Bill Maher, other famous comedians saying, look, we know Bill Maher.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.221]  He's not into kids like the rest of Hollywood.
[01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:36.341]  He's into full-grown women.
[01:14:36.341 --> 01:14:37.562]  It's well known.
[01:14:37.562 --> 01:14:39.242]  And so I should apologize to Bill Maher.
[01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:40.543]  I didn't call him a pedophile.
[01:14:40.543 --> 01:14:45.224]  I just said it's a little weird his production company is called Kid Love, but there's a lot of reasons you could say that.
[01:14:45.224 --> 01:14:50.846]  The point is, is that at least Bill Maher did stand up and say Alex Jones deserves free speech.
[01:14:50.846 --> 01:14:52.827]  And you know, it's really that simple.
[01:14:52.827 --> 01:14:55.608]  Remember, everybody was supposed to get that in America.
[01:14:55.608 --> 01:14:55.928]  Everybody.
[01:14:56.875 --> 01:15:01.797]  And it's very, very dangerous when people do things like that.
[01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:03.538]  It's very, very dangerous.
[01:15:03.538 --> 01:15:09.300]  And so I'm just very, very thankful for the audience, for all your support, all your prayers, and this great crew.
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:16.143]  And I don't do this to kiss Drudge's ass, because Drudge only links to him if he wants to.
[01:15:16.143 --> 01:15:20.585]  I wouldn't be here, and I almost don't want to say this because it'll make him come after me more, but they already know this.
[01:15:20.585 --> 01:15:22.405]  We wouldn't have survived without Matt Drudge.
[01:15:25.717 --> 01:15:28.958]  Two plus years into just the total assault.
[01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:30.978]  And so thank you, Matt Drudge.
[01:15:30.978 --> 01:15:31.878]  Thank you.
[01:15:31.878 --> 01:15:34.599]  So everybody click on Matt Drudge's sponsor, support him.
[01:15:34.599 --> 01:15:39.500]  I know from people that know Drudge well, and I know him some, but he's gone through a lot too.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:41.781]  Everybody goes through a lot that stands up for what's right.
[01:15:41.781 --> 01:15:46.302]  But that's a process of radicalizing us up to the level of the globalists to counter him.
[01:15:46.302 --> 01:15:49.023]  We're all just nice guys, but we're not laying down.

[01:16:58.368 --> 01:17:02.290]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:03.830]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:06.791]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.

[01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:27.110]  You like Secret 12?
[01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:29.713]  This is Secret 12, but twice as strong.
[01:18:29.713 --> 01:18:31.375]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[01:18:31.375 --> 01:18:34.238]  And we decided, I like the Secret 12 Plus.
[01:18:34.238 --> 01:18:37.282]  But they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[01:18:37.282 --> 01:18:38.042]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[01:18:38.042 --> 01:18:38.803]  Well, you know what?
[01:18:38.803 --> 01:18:40.085]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[01:18:40.085 --> 01:18:42.087]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[01:18:42.087 --> 01:18:43.048]  We decided to change the name.
[01:18:43.048 --> 01:18:44.269]  So when you peel off the label...
[01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:55.854]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:19:11.624 --> 01:19:23.977]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[01:19:23.977 --> 01:19:25.919]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:19:25.919 --> 01:19:28.602]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:34.282]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[01:19:34.282 --> 01:19:38.524]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:40.805]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:19:40.805 --> 01:19:43.127]  This country is in a war!
[01:19:43.127 --> 01:19:53.832]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:19:53.832 --> 01:19:57.414]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[01:20:00.856 --> 01:20:03.540]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:23.437]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:20:23.437 --> 01:20:25.119]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:20:25.119 --> 01:20:26.901]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:26.901 --> 01:20:33.170]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.420]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:55.520]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.841]  We're gonna open the phones up.
[01:20:58.841 --> 01:21:04.102]  In the next segment, and covered a ton of news, obviously, that's breaking that I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:21:04.102 --> 01:21:12.804]  But just look at the latest information pouring in to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:21:12.804 --> 01:21:15.964]  You know, Germany has a parliamentary system.
[01:21:15.964 --> 01:21:18.685]  So they have a chancellor and they have a president.
[01:21:20.353 --> 01:21:24.376]  Just like you can have a president, you can have a premier, and there's different systems.
[01:21:24.376 --> 01:21:28.858]  But normally in the parliamentary system, we have an upper and lower house.
[01:21:28.858 --> 01:21:34.042]  And in Germany, they have a president over one of the houses and a chancellor over the other.
[01:21:34.042 --> 01:21:37.504]  The chancellor has veto powers, a little bit more powerful.
[01:21:37.504 --> 01:21:40.466]  That's why Hitler was the chancellor.
[01:21:40.466 --> 01:21:46.690]  But he was first elected by a minority, which again, parliamentary systems let happen.
[01:21:46.690 --> 01:21:47.851]  Internet regulation
[01:21:49.096 --> 01:21:54.538]  Could take the wind out of the sails of populist.
[01:21:54.538 --> 01:21:57.398]  What do you think's going on?
[01:21:57.398 --> 01:22:00.119]  What do you think's happening?
[01:22:00.119 --> 01:22:04.661]  What do you think is unfolding?
[01:22:04.661 --> 01:22:15.764]  If you go back to three years ago, top globalist at Davos, top globalist in the Financial Times of London, the New York Times, in establishment articles said, if we don't stop Trump,
[01:22:17.008 --> 01:22:19.049]  There will be populism spreading all over the world.
[01:22:19.049 --> 01:22:20.350]  It started with Brexit.
[01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:21.591]  We've got it happening all over Europe.
[01:22:21.591 --> 01:22:23.753]  We've got to start censoring.
[01:22:23.753 --> 01:22:26.735]  They're going to win.
[01:22:26.735 --> 01:22:31.958]  And they did censor, but the tidal wave was so big, it made it over the seawall.
[01:22:31.958 --> 01:22:38.422]  And so now, that's all going on here.
[01:22:38.422 --> 01:22:40.624]  It's all unfolding here.
[01:22:42.270 --> 01:23:00.344]  And it's happening in Brazil, and it's happening in Germany, and it's happening in Spain, and it's happening... And even in countries where we've gotten populist elected, they've still got globalist forces there, like Russia has globalists all over it, and Soros spending billions a year of State Department money to overthrow their elected government, just like they did in Ukraine.
[01:23:00.344 --> 01:23:09.952]  And so when they talk about meddling, and they claim Russians, that Russian troll farms meddled in the election, it came out in the FBI's own reports.
[01:23:12.793 --> 01:23:15.996]  80% of it.
[01:23:15.996 --> 01:23:20.399]  80% of it.
[01:23:20.399 --> 01:23:24.521]  Right at 80% was pro-Hillary.
[01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:27.123]  Well, of course, 80% of the money was spent by the Democrats.
[01:23:27.123 --> 01:23:28.964]  Isn't that funny?
[01:23:28.964 --> 01:23:38.631]  Again, everybody knows this, but you go to Russia and other countries because they'll let you buy a company, buy time in the company to influence something.
[01:23:38.631 --> 01:23:39.952]  And so Hillary's been using Russia
[01:23:40.916 --> 01:23:52.246]  Using Russia for the fake dossier and all the rest of it, but I only raise this point to show how you have multi-national globalists absolutely everywhere.
[01:23:53.806 --> 01:23:58.888]  Who know exactly what they're doing, who are calling for more censorship.
[01:23:58.888 --> 01:24:01.408]  So see, the censorship's already gotten massive.
[01:24:01.408 --> 01:24:02.329]  It's out of control.
[01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:14.872]  They arrest you in Germany if you criticize open borders, if you criticize radical Islam, if you criticize Muslims raping people, if you criticize communists and old people being thrown out of Section 8 housing to be given to islamicists.
[01:24:14.872 --> 01:24:19.774]  But now they're openly saying we're censoring people to stop the movement.
[01:24:21.069 --> 01:24:23.330]  We're censoring the populist.
[01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:25.612]  They're not calling you right-wing, they're not calling you Nazis.
[01:24:25.612 --> 01:24:32.256]  Because now the left all over Europe goes, our pension funds are not going to be here to pay for Muslims?
[01:24:32.256 --> 01:24:35.438]  Who are 90% on welfare?
[01:24:35.438 --> 01:24:35.738]  That's 90%.
[01:24:35.738 --> 01:24:38.099]  It was 80-something, now it's 90%.
[01:24:38.099 --> 01:24:40.521]  Just don't work, why should they?
[01:24:40.521 --> 01:24:43.643]  They sit around in leisure suits all day, for whatever reason.
[01:24:43.643 --> 01:24:50.067]  I don't know why Russians and Muslims all in Europe wear leisure suits, wear, you know, track outfits, jogging suits.
[01:24:51.766 --> 01:24:57.989]  But the culture of gangbang black gangster rap is the operating system of the world now.
[01:24:57.989 --> 01:25:00.171]  All from Japan to Russia to Germany.
[01:25:00.171 --> 01:25:01.111]  It doesn't matter if they're white.
[01:25:01.111 --> 01:25:02.912]  It doesn't matter if they're Arabic.
[01:25:02.912 --> 01:25:16.279]  You know, just all these kids on welfare just dress like gangsters and call women whores and... All of the chivalry, all the West is draining out of us like our legs are chopped off and the blood's like psst, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst, psst.
[01:25:16.279 --> 01:25:18.881]  And I'm not saying this to be negative.
[01:25:20.922 --> 01:25:26.184]  I'm saying this because it's the truth and it's what's going on.
[01:25:26.184 --> 01:25:39.747]  And he was quoted in major newspapers in a full speech that he gave, there's video of it, that it's time to shut down populists who are against globalism and the corrupt EU.
[01:25:39.747 --> 01:25:41.348]  See, now it's not that you're Nazis.
[01:25:41.348 --> 01:25:42.648]  They're dispensing with all that.
[01:25:42.648 --> 01:25:48.910]  They're saying you're not allowed to be against the EU expanding its power and having its own military so you can't get out of the European Union.
[01:25:52.964 --> 01:25:59.227]  States that never voted to be in it, they tricked them in a trade deal, just like NAFTA, GATT, or the TPP.
[01:25:59.227 --> 01:26:12.753]  In a speech delivered to Republica Internet Conference in Berlin, German President Frank Walter Steinmeier scolded big tech platforms for not doing enough.
[01:26:12.753 --> 01:26:14.954]  See, that's how all these fines work.
[01:26:14.954 --> 01:26:16.314]  I have an article right here.
[01:26:16.314 --> 01:26:17.535]  Five billion dollar fine
[01:26:18.851 --> 01:26:24.375]  That the Democrats want for Facebook illegally spying on Americans, and the Republicans think it should be $20 billion.
[01:26:24.375 --> 01:26:26.336]  But see how the Democrats work it.
[01:26:26.336 --> 01:26:32.960]  They get them to censor me and other conservatives, and now they've made hundreds of billions spying on people in America.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:34.941]  Now they've just got to pay a little fine of $5 billion.
[01:26:34.941 --> 01:26:42.706]  Kind of like banks that get caught money laundering $387 billion like Wells Fargo did, and they paid a billion dollar fine.
[01:26:42.706 --> 01:26:43.847]  It's like $998 million.
[01:26:43.847 --> 01:26:44.948]  Remember that 10 years ago?
[01:26:44.948 --> 01:26:46.449]  It was in Bloomberg everywhere?
[01:26:47.964 --> 01:26:50.945]  So if you rob a bank, you've got a whole truckload of stuff you just stole.
[01:26:50.945 --> 01:26:51.646]  The cops bust you.
[01:26:51.646 --> 01:26:56.188]  They go, just give us one bag of coins out of a hundred bags of coins and we'll let you go.
[01:26:56.188 --> 01:26:58.709]  And so it's the same thing here.
[01:26:58.709 --> 01:27:09.814]  He scolds social media like Merkel, the chancellor, did two years ago to Zuckerberg saying, you're not stopping Germans criticizing open borders and Islamic invasion.
[01:27:09.814 --> 01:27:12.015]  And he said, don't worry, I'll do it soon, which he's done.
[01:27:15.256 --> 01:27:17.420]  Yeah, you guys found $1 billion for their mortgage abuse.
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:22.328]  It was Wells Fargo, $300-and-something billion dollars in laundered money.
[01:27:22.328 --> 01:27:23.009]  They paid a $998 million fine.
[01:27:23.009 --> 01:27:23.429]  But, continuing.
[01:27:29.284 --> 01:27:38.127]  The president said the new internet regulation could be the most effective way to take the wind out of the sails of demagogues and populists.
[01:27:38.127 --> 01:27:48.730]  Those evil populists that don't want people running them, that are getting rid of their country, bankrupting them, bringing in foreign invaders that don't work, and who want to take your free speech.
[01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:54.532]  How dare you want to be involved and have speech against people that want to smuzzle you?
[01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:58.067]  Flaming authoritarians.
[01:27:58.067 --> 01:27:59.910]  I want them silenced.
[01:27:59.910 --> 01:28:01.332]  I want them muted.
[01:28:01.332 --> 01:28:03.375]  I want them shut up.
[01:28:03.375 --> 01:28:05.738]  Heil Hitler, he says.
[01:28:05.738 --> 01:28:07.561]  That's what Hitler did.
[01:28:07.561 --> 01:28:09.403]  That's what authoritarians do.
[01:28:12.133 --> 01:28:13.614]  Totally sick.
[01:28:13.614 --> 01:28:18.819]  Thumbing his nose at small groups, he calls, who cause a disproportionate amount of noise.
[01:28:18.819 --> 01:28:20.801]  He said the new liberties need new rules.
[01:28:20.801 --> 01:28:22.062]  The new liberties.
[01:28:22.062 --> 01:28:23.303]  Talk about 1984.
[01:28:23.303 --> 01:28:25.324]  Take your liberties away.
[01:28:25.324 --> 01:28:27.366]  Take your speech away.
[01:28:27.366 --> 01:28:31.009]  And call it a new liberty.
[01:28:31.009 --> 01:28:33.191]  The freedom of being a slave.
[01:28:33.191 --> 01:28:33.832]  War is peace.
[01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:39.479]  Freedom is slavery.
[01:28:39.479 --> 01:28:41.400]  Two plus two equals whatever we say it does.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.600]  Unbelievable.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.241]  Okay.
[01:28:43.241 --> 01:28:43.461]  Okay.
[01:28:43.461 --> 01:28:46.982]  I don't have time to tell you what's coming up next, but there's a bunch of it, and I'll give the number out.
[01:28:46.982 --> 01:28:47.742]  It's all coming up.
[01:28:47.742 --> 01:28:49.543]  This is the American Resistance.
[01:28:49.543 --> 01:28:51.003]  This is the Infowar.
[01:28:51.003 --> 01:28:52.203]  This is your voice.
[01:28:52.203 --> 01:28:54.644]  So amplify it or the enemy can win.
[01:28:54.644 --> 01:28:56.705]  Fight now or lose forever!
[01:28:57.485 --> 01:29:04.648]  Hey guys, it's Scott Bauer here, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.

[01:29:30.144 --> 01:29:39.613]  Well, I'm a former CBOE market maker for Amazon Options, former Vice President of Goldman Sachs, and I have over 25 years of professional trading experience.
[01:29:39.613 --> 01:29:41.615]  I'm telling you, this stock is hot.
[01:29:41.615 --> 01:29:45.339]  But be warned, the stock may move soon, so you need to claim it before it does.

[01:30:00.006 --> 01:30:01.727]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:30:01.727 --> 01:30:03.248]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[01:30:03.248 --> 01:30:05.289]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:30:05.289 --> 01:30:10.172]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:30:10.172 --> 01:30:13.994]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:30:13.994 --> 01:30:22.059]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:30:22.979 --> 01:30:25.781]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[01:30:25.781 --> 01:30:33.047]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:30:33.047 --> 01:30:36.991]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:30:36.991 --> 01:30:42.956]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:30:42.956 --> 01:30:45.978]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[01:30:45.978 --> 01:30:47.479]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:30:47.479 --> 01:30:50.522]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[01:30:53.203 --> 01:31:01.729]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[01:31:01.729 --> 01:31:04.671]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:31:04.671 --> 01:31:07.613]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[01:31:07.613 --> 01:31:12.176]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply, one of the top
[01:31:13.228 --> 01:31:22.371]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:31:22.371 --> 01:31:27.712]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:31:27.712 --> 01:31:29.993]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:31:29.993 --> 01:31:33.114]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[01:31:33.494 --> 01:31:34.995]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:31:34.995 --> 01:31:38.976]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:31:38.976 --> 01:31:41.176]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:31:41.176 --> 01:31:42.737]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:31:42.737 --> 01:31:44.737]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:31:44.737 --> 01:31:47.258]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:31:47.258 --> 01:31:52.259]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:31:52.259 --> 01:31:57.641]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:31:58.171 --> 01:32:08.759]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:08.759 --> 01:32:10.821]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:10.821 --> 01:32:13.683]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:13.683 --> 01:32:15.184]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:15.184 --> 01:32:18.307]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:32:18.527 --> 01:32:21.990]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:24.072]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:32:24.072 --> 01:32:33.780]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:46.350]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:47.851]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:20.151 --> 01:33:22.811]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:33:22.811 --> 01:33:25.792]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:25.792 --> 01:33:28.032]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.032 --> 01:33:30.773]  Lines fall on my face and hands.
[01:33:30.773 --> 01:33:33.833]  Lines fall from the ups and downs.
[01:33:33.833 --> 01:33:35.954]  I'm in the middle without any plans.
[01:34:01.989 --> 01:34:10.631]  All right, folks.
[01:34:10.631 --> 01:34:13.011]  I want to stop right there.
[01:34:13.011 --> 01:34:15.992]  And I want to give the number out, but it's hard to turn Alice Cooper off.
[01:34:15.992 --> 01:34:17.972]  So I'm going to play a little bit more Alice Cooper here in just a moment.
[01:34:17.972 --> 01:34:18.692]  You know, he's a patron.
[01:34:18.692 --> 01:34:20.072]  He's a listener.
[01:34:20.072 --> 01:34:21.473]  I've never been able to get a hold of him.
[01:34:21.473 --> 01:34:24.093]  I didn't really ask for his phone number from the folks that told me he was listeners.
[01:34:24.093 --> 01:34:26.134]  Two different major rock stars.
[01:34:26.134 --> 01:34:27.314]  But it's not about name dropping.
[01:34:27.314 --> 01:34:28.314]  Oh, Alice Cooper likes me.
[01:34:29.426 --> 01:34:34.848]  It's the fact that Alice Cooper, we know, is a Trump supporter and a patriot and just one more person.
[01:34:34.848 --> 01:34:43.752]  All the cool people like Bruce Willis or like Rowdy H, you know, in Rawhide, who's actually, you know who, right?
[01:34:43.752 --> 01:34:44.693]  Greatest actor in U.S.
[01:34:44.693 --> 01:34:47.434]  history because he's a real patriot in the Air Force.
[01:34:47.434 --> 01:34:49.275]  Veteran Clint Eastwood.
[01:34:49.275 --> 01:34:52.757]  All those folks are listeners.
[01:34:52.757 --> 01:34:53.637]  You know who else is a listener?
[01:34:55.421 --> 01:34:55.982]  You know who?
[01:34:55.982 --> 01:34:57.403]  Kurt Russell!
[01:34:57.403 --> 01:35:03.169]  It's like every person I actually like from Hollywood is a patriot.
[01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:07.074]  And all the others I could never care less about.
[01:35:07.074 --> 01:35:11.598]  And then you find out that they're patriots.
[01:35:11.598 --> 01:35:16.864]  And then you find out that they're so humble
[01:35:17.904 --> 01:35:21.225]  They don't see themselves as going out and saying something.
[01:35:21.225 --> 01:35:23.865]  Like it's arrogant if they get politically involved.
[01:35:23.865 --> 01:35:28.626]  Will all the leftists get politically involved all day and tell us how to live and tell us what to do?
[01:35:28.626 --> 01:35:32.267]  So we need all those people to go public.
[01:35:32.267 --> 01:35:38.168]  And some, that I won't name that I've talked to, have said some things after they've been challenged.
[01:35:38.168 --> 01:35:45.069]  But if you run into those people in Maui, let's say you're at the grocery store, like a lot of folks have done,
[01:35:46.554 --> 01:35:48.975]  Imagine if I went to Maui once and ran into Clint Eastwood.
[01:35:48.975 --> 01:35:52.656]  That'd be cool, but that would be a private matter.
[01:35:52.656 --> 01:36:01.958]  And then challenge them to say something and to do something, because everything is in the balance right now.
[01:36:01.958 --> 01:36:09.260]  Now, I'm gonna give the number out, and I have a few other things to hit on here, but I want everybody to understand something.
[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:10.080]  Hillary Clinton
[01:36:11.602 --> 01:36:14.603]  Sick the entire media on this audience, because she fears you.
[01:36:14.603 --> 01:36:16.743]  That's what she fears is a focal point.
[01:36:16.743 --> 01:36:20.204]  I'm just a focal point.
[01:36:20.204 --> 01:36:33.788]  And we know, and I'm not going to bring these big political guns out until it's time, we know George Soros and Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party are financing the lawsuits against us.
[01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:36.409]  I mean, we go to court hearings, sometimes there's eight lawyers.
[01:36:38.789 --> 01:36:40.670]  And many of them formerly worked for Hillary Clinton.
[01:36:40.670 --> 01:36:44.753]  Now, in the end, we know on appeals, even if they rig stuff, we're going to win.
[01:36:44.753 --> 01:36:49.636]  But we're going to fight every step of the way as they try to overturn the First Amendment.
[01:36:49.636 --> 01:36:54.879]  But here's a bigleagepolitics.com story by the great investigative journalist Tom Pappard.
[01:36:56.325 --> 01:37:00.666]  We're going to post to InfoWars.com and I hope you share, but share it from BigLeaguePolitics.com.
[01:37:00.666 --> 01:37:02.666]  That's not as censored as InfoWars.
[01:37:02.666 --> 01:37:11.568]  Facebook hired former Hillary press director to inform media of Alex Jones' ban.
[01:37:11.568 --> 01:37:22.949]  And you've heard Hillary is gearing up to run in this field of 20 plus.
[01:37:22.949 --> 01:37:24.850]  You say that's arrogant?
[01:37:24.850 --> 01:37:25.450]  That's insane.
[01:37:26.598 --> 01:37:28.560]  Well, she wants to keep getting money into her foundation.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:34.045]  She still wants to project her power so that people are scared to go after her for her criminal actions.
[01:37:34.045 --> 01:37:39.931]  She almost needs to run to stay out of prison, and now mainline pundits are actually saying that.
[01:37:39.931 --> 01:37:51.622]  I just know that I was authorized the first time a person in security
[01:37:52.728 --> 01:37:56.891]  Just like Secret Service at the RNC said, Hillary has a black ambulance.
[01:37:56.891 --> 01:38:02.694]  She's having convulsions on average every 45 minutes when they get her off the drugs so she can talk.
[01:38:02.694 --> 01:38:08.038]  She has to take, I guess it's Depakote and a bunch of other stuff that keeps you from having seizures.
[01:38:08.038 --> 01:38:09.779]  They got a mobile medical center that follows her around.
[01:38:09.779 --> 01:38:13.722]  Remember this three years ago?
[01:38:14.645 --> 01:38:29.122]  We had Millie Weaver shadowing her all over the country, and then she'd go to tent for an hour, and they'd have emergency, and they'd cancel her speeches, and then a fella visiting caught her collapsing on 9-11, 2016, in New York, and the media cut the tape and said, we made it up, fake news, that she only stumbled.
[01:38:29.122 --> 01:38:33.507]  No, she fell down like a sack of potatoes, like a side of beef.
[01:38:33.507 --> 01:38:34.589]  But the reason I'm getting at this is,
[01:38:36.442 --> 01:38:46.991]  The Secret Service told us, we can't tell you here at the RNC, you will be given a message in the next three weeks in Austin of the specifics.
[01:38:46.991 --> 01:38:50.955]  And they said, you've got to follow her everywhere.
[01:38:50.955 --> 01:38:53.797]  This is unprecedented in the annals of the Secret Service, but they knew how criminal she was.
[01:38:53.797 --> 01:38:56.860]  She's a foreign agent of the CHICOMS.
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:38:58.582]  Well, about a month later, we get the message.
[01:39:00.464 --> 01:39:06.728]  And they said, you gotta get her in Ohio, you gotta get her in New York, you gotta get her in D.C.
[01:39:06.728 --> 01:39:08.729]  And they said, why haven't you already gotten her?
[01:39:08.729 --> 01:39:13.653]  We already told you, she's already had convulsions repeatedly that could have been caught on tape.
[01:39:13.653 --> 01:39:16.014]  That's why they'll park in a remote area and sneak her in.
[01:39:16.014 --> 01:39:17.075]  They don't just pull right in.
[01:39:17.075 --> 01:39:19.216]  I mean, that lady was so sick back then.
[01:39:19.216 --> 01:39:21.958]  She probably had her third brain surgery since then, we don't know.
[01:39:21.958 --> 01:39:25.260]  We know she had two before, like Biden.
[01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:26.241]  She's always falling down.
[01:39:27.304 --> 01:39:36.151]  The reason I get it, that is, they don't want us on air the next time to deal that political death blow.
[01:39:36.151 --> 01:39:41.054]  And that's why they've got a raging hard-on to take us down.
[01:39:41.054 --> 01:39:42.755]  And then here's the article.
[01:39:42.755 --> 01:39:45.918]  Facebook press contact.
[01:39:45.918 --> 01:39:48.720]  Had extensive work with the Clinton family and Obama White House.
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:49.981]  Yeah.
[01:39:49.981 --> 01:39:51.122]  I'm saying every bit of this.
[01:39:51.122 --> 01:39:52.102]  They're breathing down my neck.
[01:39:52.102 --> 01:39:52.803]  And I'm not bitching.
[01:39:53.766 --> 01:39:57.008]  Other people aren't willing to take these monsters on.
[01:39:57.008 --> 01:39:58.569]  I am.
[01:39:58.569 --> 01:40:01.930]  That's why I'm thanking our AMNF affiliates and our TV affiliates.
[01:40:01.930 --> 01:40:03.551]  But they all get great ratings.
[01:40:03.551 --> 01:40:05.612]  And they get some threats, and they get some boycotts.
[01:40:05.612 --> 01:40:06.233]  So what?
[01:40:06.233 --> 01:40:07.754]  We're fighting for America.
[01:40:07.754 --> 01:40:09.555]  This is it.
[01:40:09.555 --> 01:40:11.676]  And so yes, I'm fighting for my identity.
[01:40:11.676 --> 01:40:12.676]  They say I'm a liar.
[01:40:12.676 --> 01:40:14.437]  They say I'm fake news.
[01:40:14.437 --> 01:40:18.759]  They say anything I've ever admitted we made a mistake on, that I did it on purpose.
[01:40:18.759 --> 01:40:21.081]  They never admit when they're wrong, because they do it on purpose.
[01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:21.361]  I don't.
[01:40:22.657 --> 01:40:26.138]  And that's why I'm saying we're fighting for our lives.
[01:40:26.138 --> 01:40:26.899]  And here it is.
[01:40:26.899 --> 01:40:27.239]  Huge!
[01:40:27.239 --> 01:40:33.881]  Facebook hired former Hillary Press Director to inform media of Alex Jones being taken off.
[01:40:33.881 --> 01:40:34.502]  And what do they want?
[01:40:34.502 --> 01:40:35.842]  My name not even mentioned.
[01:40:35.842 --> 01:40:37.663]  They're running it.
[01:40:37.663 --> 01:40:47.547]  When Big League Politics contacted Facebook to clarify why Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Warren Lummer, and Milo Yiannopoulos were banned by Facebook and Instagram, we discovered that Facebook employee... Oh, this has got to go on Drudge.
[01:40:47.547 --> 01:40:49.308]  I never tell Drudge what he needs to do, but my God.
[01:40:50.595 --> 01:40:57.259]  The Facebook employee assigned to handle these communications is a former press director of Hillary for America.
[01:40:57.259 --> 01:41:09.905]  Sarah Pollack, at the Policy Communications Management of Facebook, who responded to big league politics when we sought comment on Jones, Watson, Loomer, and Annapolis, were banned.
[01:41:09.905 --> 01:41:17.770]  She explains that users are no longer allowed to share videos or links, including videos of Jones, and explained that the decision was made in part because Jones interviewed Gab McGinnis,
[01:41:18.792 --> 01:41:40.084]  On his radio program, who they designated as a hate figure, because they falsely quoted the FBI saying it was a terror group, which was made up, but by using that, they then put it in Interpol that he's a terrorist, and then put a designation on my bank account at G2 that I'm a terrorist, and then because Paul Watson works with us, he was designated as a terrorist!
[01:41:40.084 --> 01:41:42.286]  It says terrorism!
[01:41:42.286 --> 01:41:43.446]  Child trafficking!
[01:41:43.446 --> 01:41:45.167]  Human trafficking!
[01:41:45.167 --> 01:41:46.168]  Kidnapping!
[01:41:46.168 --> 01:41:46.848]  Murder!
[01:41:46.848 --> 01:41:47.649]  Organized crime!
[01:41:50.146 --> 01:41:59.356]  All because a fake story out of Portland that the FBI, not a judge, not a jury, said that they're a terrorist group.
[01:41:59.356 --> 01:41:59.777]  Are we clear?
[01:41:59.777 --> 01:42:03.081]  The FBI said, we never said that.
[01:42:03.081 --> 01:42:04.562]  Does it matter?
[01:42:04.562 --> 01:42:10.209]  Now in Interpol, now in the banking system, now in G2 out of Boston that runs this all.
[01:42:11.468 --> 01:42:13.049]  And we send you two others nice things.
[01:42:13.049 --> 01:42:14.590]  Listen, I'm not a convicted criminal.
[01:42:14.590 --> 01:42:15.370]  I'm not a terrorist.
[01:42:15.370 --> 01:42:18.232]  I haven't gotten parking tickets in a decade.
[01:42:18.232 --> 01:42:19.533]  We have your documents.
[01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:19.913]  Call us.
[01:42:19.913 --> 01:42:20.673]  Please take it.
[01:42:20.673 --> 01:42:24.356]  They don't respond because they believe Hillary's still gonna win.
[01:42:24.356 --> 01:42:26.037]  They believe they'll defeat Trump.
[01:42:26.037 --> 01:42:28.818]  Think how sick that is!
[01:42:28.818 --> 01:42:30.219]  And it's all right here.
[01:42:30.219 --> 01:42:33.361]  And anybody, whether it's Joe Biden, anybody, even interviews a proud boy.
[01:42:34.403 --> 01:42:38.205]  Who interview someone who's never enlisted a terrorist, you get banned.
[01:42:38.205 --> 01:42:41.047]  If that isn't terrorizing us, I don't know what is.
[01:42:41.047 --> 01:42:44.048]  If that isn't fascism, what is it?
[01:42:44.048 --> 01:42:45.089]  Stand with us.
[01:42:45.089 --> 01:42:46.089]  Spread the links.
[01:42:46.089 --> 01:42:47.470]  Don't let them win.
[01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:48.951]  Because you're next.

[01:43:28.666 --> 01:43:30.347]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[01:43:30.347 --> 01:43:33.189]  And we decided, I like Secret 12 Plus.
[01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:36.251]  But they said, look, when you do plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[01:43:36.251 --> 01:43:37.012]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[01:43:37.012 --> 01:43:37.773]  Well, you know what?
[01:43:37.773 --> 01:43:39.053]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[01:43:39.053 --> 01:43:41.035]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[01:43:41.035 --> 01:43:41.996]  We decided to change the name.
[01:43:41.996 --> 01:43:43.217]  So when you peel off the label...
[01:43:44.438 --> 01:43:48.141]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[01:43:48.141 --> 01:43:50.944]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.
[01:43:50.944 --> 01:43:52.846]  Better than Secret 12 ever was.

[01:45:03.285 --> 01:45:11.847]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:45:11.847 --> 01:45:14.828]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:45:14.828 --> 01:45:16.568]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:45:16.568 --> 01:45:22.830]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:30.252]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[01:45:30.252 --> 01:45:33.213]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:45:33.213 --> 01:45:37.155]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:45:37.155 --> 01:45:41.116]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:45:41.116 --> 01:45:42.937]  I've got two in my home.
[01:45:42.937 --> 01:45:49.039]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:45:49.039 --> 01:45:49.880]  Don't live
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:54.766]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[01:45:54.766 --> 01:45:56.028]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:45:58.041 --> 01:46:02.162]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:46:02.162 --> 01:46:09.223]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[01:46:21.826 --> 01:46:22.507]  We're good to go!
[01:46:43.383 --> 01:46:45.865]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:15.659 --> 01:47:22.004]  So, I'm playing this song from Alice Cooper because, uh, how many people you think of can actually live by this song?
[01:47:22.004 --> 01:47:26.547]  I got no friends because they read the papers.
[01:47:26.547 --> 01:47:28.949]  They can't be seen with me.
[01:47:28.949 --> 01:47:30.350]  I'm feeling real shot down.
[01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:32.951]  I'm feeling me.
[01:47:32.951 --> 01:47:33.412]  Don't worry.
[01:47:36.889 --> 01:47:46.132]  All the little fake right-wingers can go on YouTube and Facebook and call me a Jewish agent and a traitor, and it gets boosted by Silicon Valley, because it's not true!
[01:47:46.132 --> 01:47:52.914]  I'm just an American patriot, attacking the actual globalists.
[01:47:52.914 --> 01:47:55.755]  So they attack me from every angle.
[01:47:55.755 --> 01:47:58.616]  There's a lot of mentally ill, weak people out there.
[01:47:58.616 --> 01:47:59.956]  But our listeners aren't.
[01:47:59.956 --> 01:48:01.677]  They're hardcore.
[01:48:01.677 --> 01:48:02.897]  And they're awesome.
[01:48:02.897 --> 01:48:04.958]  And they're strong.
[01:48:04.958 --> 01:48:05.858]  And we're moving forward.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.523]  And that's what's exciting.
[01:48:09.523 --> 01:48:11.887]  Alright.
[01:48:11.887 --> 01:48:17.494]  I want to open the phones up on a specific topic for first-time callers.
[01:48:17.494 --> 01:48:20.218]  That means if you've ever called but didn't get through or whatever, first-time callers.
[01:48:21.863 --> 01:48:23.483]  What does Trump need to do?
[01:48:23.483 --> 01:48:38.707]  What does Congress need to do to battle leftist organized racketeering to bully, intimidate, blacklist, take the bank accounts away, fire, censor, and then defame us once we're taken off big tech platforms?
[01:48:38.707 --> 01:48:40.227]  What does Congress need to do?
[01:48:40.227 --> 01:48:41.687]  What does the President need to do?
[01:48:41.687 --> 01:48:44.248]  But more importantly, that's only one part of the equation.
[01:48:45.376 --> 01:48:47.357]  What are you going to do?
[01:48:47.357 --> 01:48:51.620]  You start marching peacefully against these big tech companies, small or large.
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:59.606]  You start going to these 20-something Democratic events and bringing up their criminal activity and how they openly want to confiscate guns.
[01:48:59.606 --> 01:49:08.552]  You start hijacking, legally and lawfully, live TV feeds at public events, which is something I go out and do myself.
[01:49:08.552 --> 01:49:11.774]  It devastated the Clintons in 2016.
[01:49:11.774 --> 01:49:13.415]  Let's devastate them again.
[01:49:15.523 --> 01:49:18.244]  That fell on yesterday that didn't do a great job.
[01:49:18.244 --> 01:49:21.966]  These people are not used to anybody standing up to them.
[01:49:21.966 --> 01:49:23.867]  And now is the time.
[01:49:23.867 --> 01:49:30.510]  Or start a channel on YouTube or wherever and go out with a camera and just show the left and what crazies they are.
[01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:31.390]  Hell, go talk to them.
[01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:32.491]  They'll tell you, I love Satan.
[01:49:32.491 --> 01:49:35.092]  I love killing babies.
[01:49:35.092 --> 01:49:41.855]  You know, they did a Bon Iver takeoff during the campaign three years ago.
[01:49:41.855 --> 01:49:44.316]  Where I said, Hillary's into sick stuff, man.
[01:49:45.691 --> 01:49:52.614]  And I talked about how the left wants to keep babies alive and sell their body parts.
[01:49:52.614 --> 01:49:54.335]  What more do you know from these people?
[01:49:54.335 --> 01:49:57.416]  I go out and face these scum.
[01:49:57.416 --> 01:49:59.617]  They have green colored skins.
[01:49:59.617 --> 01:50:02.479]  They climb out from under rocks.
[01:50:02.479 --> 01:50:05.660]  And they say, we want to kill babies.
[01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:08.822]  I have them on video.
[01:50:08.822 --> 01:50:11.443]  And now you're like, my God, we had her on video now.
[01:50:11.443 --> 01:50:12.443]  That's all they do.
[01:50:12.443 --> 01:50:13.864]  You go to this week.
[01:50:15.285 --> 01:50:18.966]  We're only up to Tuesday, but Sunday and Monday, I never even got to it.
[01:50:18.966 --> 01:50:37.911]  Wait, I had two more videos today, so wait, that's... Six or seven videos since last Friday of Democrats, Democrat legislature members, you name it, coming up to conservative protest of nice people and saying, F you white people, F you, we're gonna kill the babies.
[01:50:40.626 --> 01:50:42.127]  I guess I could dig it out of the stack and start playing.
[01:50:42.127 --> 01:50:45.110]  I mean, that's the thing, I read all this news and I kind of forget about it.
[01:50:45.110 --> 01:50:48.492]  They're operating, by the way, it's a white guy.
[01:50:48.492 --> 01:50:49.493]  It's a white state rep.
[01:50:49.493 --> 01:50:56.279]  But he's gay, so it's like, I don't care if you're gay, but don't wear it like it's a freaking Superman cape.
[01:50:56.279 --> 01:51:04.406]  So you can walk up to some high school girls who aren't even white, who are at a pro-life event, and start screaming at them, you know, F you white people.
[01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:13.144]  And then there's some middle-aged woman or older lady, distinguished lady, and he's screaming at her, calling her a white scum!
[01:51:13.144 --> 01:51:20.750]  And it's, I'm telling you, it's like these weird white professor leader types who are the ones everywhere leading this.
[01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:23.592]  And I'm not like Virtue signaling, oh, it's white people leading this.
[01:51:23.592 --> 01:51:29.077]  It is white people leading this!
[01:51:29.077 --> 01:51:30.698]  Let me dig the article out.
[01:51:30.698 --> 01:51:32.920]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.361]  It's up on NewsWars.com.
[01:51:36.032 --> 01:51:37.532]  There's so many of them.
[01:51:37.532 --> 01:51:40.093]  I'll dig it out during the break and give you all the details of this guy.
[01:51:40.093 --> 01:51:46.054]  There's two videos of him, and then I've got the one of the women chanting, Hail Satan, we're gonna kill babies from yesterday.
[01:51:46.054 --> 01:51:55.236]  And there was another event where there was a pro-life event at a state house, and people spontaneously started saying, Hail Satan, we're gonna kill babies.
[01:51:55.236 --> 01:51:57.396]  That's not the one from the Texas house a few years ago.
[01:51:57.396 --> 01:52:00.157]  These are new.
[01:52:00.157 --> 01:52:01.037]  I'll never find it.
[01:52:01.037 --> 01:52:04.958]  People think I lay all these papers out as some type of
[01:52:06.519 --> 01:52:11.081]  Like, oh look, like Karl Rove said he used to go to debates and have like a stack of cue cards and intimidate the person.
[01:52:11.081 --> 01:52:14.563]  I don't like computers, since they were really slow, they still are.
[01:52:14.563 --> 01:52:17.565]  They change stories now, they take them down now especially.
[01:52:17.565 --> 01:52:20.746]  You couldn't have 300 tabs open like I have.
[01:52:20.746 --> 01:52:23.948]  This is 300 articles that I at least looked at today.
[01:52:23.948 --> 01:52:25.909]  Some I read part of, okay?
[01:52:25.909 --> 01:52:26.589]  Some I read all of.
[01:52:26.589 --> 01:52:31.792]  I probably read 10 of them, scanned through 50, just read the headlines of the others.
[01:52:31.792 --> 01:52:32.673]  But I looked at all this.
[01:52:33.493 --> 01:52:36.415]  Now, can you imagine having 300 and something tabs up?
[01:52:36.415 --> 01:52:37.736]  I bet this is 300 articles.
[01:52:37.736 --> 01:52:40.738]  Hell, I bet it's 500 articles!
[01:52:40.738 --> 01:52:46.002]  The end of the show today, let's do a Snapchat, one of the few places we can still put stuff out to everybody.
[01:52:46.002 --> 01:52:48.123]  They'll all attack that now.
[01:52:48.123 --> 01:52:50.205]  It's fine, whatever.
[01:52:50.205 --> 01:52:55.828]  And let's have one of the producers come in here and count the papers.
[01:52:55.828 --> 01:52:58.530]  I like, you know, look at the gumball thing, I'm trying to guess how many it is.
[01:52:58.530 --> 01:52:59.231]  I bet this is
[01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:05.431]  My gut's always closer to right.
[01:53:05.431 --> 01:53:09.853]  I bet it's 314 pieces, 314 individual articles.
[01:53:09.853 --> 01:53:13.915]  Those pieces of paper, it's probably 800.
[01:53:13.915 --> 01:53:14.936]  So 314 pieces of paper.
[01:53:14.936 --> 01:53:18.538]  We'll see you later today, after the show, we'll shoot a video, see if I'm right, how close I am.
[01:53:18.538 --> 01:53:19.438]  314 pieces, 314 articles here.
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:39.797]  And in here, without me even looking, are articles of people saying, we want to kill babies, hail Satan, we're gonna kill your children, I love to kill babies, F you white people, I hate babies, we're gonna get babies, F you kids, I'm gonna, oh, oh, I'm gonna dox you kids!
[01:53:39.797 --> 01:53:40.958]  He walks over to a...
[01:53:42.031 --> 01:53:47.352]  Looks like Hispanic young ladies who are anti-murdering babies, you know, just have their souls.
[01:53:47.352 --> 01:53:52.553]  And he starts screaming, you're a bunch of white people, I'm going to get you, I'm going to dox you.
[01:53:52.553 --> 01:53:57.654]  And he starts saying, anyone online, tell me their names so we can harass them.
[01:53:57.654 --> 01:54:03.276]  Twitter is treating this state rep, guys, I can't find the stack is why the problem, but there it is, his name is.
[01:54:03.276 --> 01:54:08.677]  Facebook takes no action against state rep, and enter to Twitter, who threatened to dox teenage pro-lifers on video.
[01:54:08.677 --> 01:54:08.997]  Scroll down.
[01:54:10.257 --> 01:54:11.758]  That's what, Paul Joseph Watson article.
[01:54:11.758 --> 01:54:21.041]  But then there's another one from another site of him, as there's hours of this, of him, go back to the top, I'll read his name, of him attacking other people.
[01:54:21.041 --> 01:54:28.164]  It's the first paragraph, yeah, thank you, I'll just, I can do it, first paragraph, thanks.
[01:54:28.164 --> 01:54:30.785]  That's Brian Sims.
[01:54:30.785 --> 01:54:36.347]  He brazenly tried to dox a group of teenage girls, screaming they were white people, when they weren't even, quote, white.
[01:54:36.347 --> 01:54:39.208]  This is the cuckoo level we've reached.
[01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:43.871]  But he hops around going, I'm gay, I'm gay, I'm gay!
[01:54:43.871 --> 01:54:47.953]  So you get to act like a total monster?
[01:54:47.953 --> 01:54:52.015]  What an accomplishment!
[01:54:52.015 --> 01:54:54.516]  Anybody could shove hot dogs up their ass.
[01:54:54.516 --> 01:54:58.658]  I mean, this is unbelievable!
[01:54:58.658 --> 01:55:03.200]  But he is royalty.
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.862]  I'm sorry to say, I apologize, family audience, I'm out of control, I'm really angry, I'm really sick of it.
[01:55:07.862 --> 01:55:10.283]  But remember, these are the type of folks who teach their kids at school, so whatever.
[01:55:11.616 --> 01:55:15.437]  The Democrats can cuss all over TV, all over the radio, and it's like, it's okay, but conservatives do it.
[01:55:15.437 --> 01:55:17.698]  It's the end of the world.
[01:55:17.698 --> 01:55:20.499]  So I'm gonna go to break, I'm gonna come back with him, I'm gonna give the number out.
[01:55:20.499 --> 01:55:23.660]  The number's 877-789-2539.
[01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:24.500]  877-789-2539.
[01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:31.743]  This is racketeering, this is bullying, this is assault on free speech, this is everything under the sun.
[01:55:31.743 --> 01:55:34.024]  How do we take action legally, lawfully, against it?
[01:55:34.024 --> 01:55:35.384]  And what does the President need to do?
[01:55:35.384 --> 01:55:37.265]  Let's form a battle plan straight ahead.
[01:55:37.265 --> 01:55:37.765]  That said,
[01:55:39.309 --> 01:55:45.022]  We now have, drumroll, Ultra 12, which is really Secret 12 Plus.
[01:55:45.022 --> 01:55:49.511]  It's twice as strong, twice as much of the highest quality methylcobalamin.
[01:55:50.635 --> 01:55:55.017]  It's been sold out for almost six months, five months, five and a half months.
[01:55:55.017 --> 01:55:59.499]  It is the highest grade you can get in the country.
[01:55:59.499 --> 01:56:02.300]  And it is twice as strong.
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:10.444]  And so when you make something even better, because you sign a longer contract, get a better deal, and, you know, really twist people's arms to get better deals.
[01:56:10.444 --> 01:56:13.226]  So the audience gets an even better deal.
[01:56:13.226 --> 01:56:13.946]  And so we get a better deal.
[01:56:15.902 --> 01:56:17.503]  You have to change the name when it's reformulated.
[01:56:17.503 --> 01:56:20.546]  So Ultra 12 is really Secret 12+.
[01:56:20.546 --> 01:56:24.029]  It's 50% off out of the gates because I want you to see how great it is.
[01:56:24.029 --> 01:56:25.170]  Take it under the tongue.
[01:56:25.170 --> 01:56:32.456]  It's the only way other than injections to absorb more of the vitamin B12 because most people cannot absorb almost any of it through the stomach itself.

[01:57:09.451 --> 01:57:18.997]  They had BuzzFeed and all the other criminal organizations try to harass the different third-party sites that test our stuff and threaten them, saying, we know Jones fakes all this.
[01:57:18.997 --> 01:57:20.038]  These aren't real people.
[01:57:20.038 --> 01:57:21.319]  No, they're real people.
[01:57:21.319 --> 01:57:22.039]  Many of you know.
[01:57:22.039 --> 01:57:22.640]  It's you.

[01:57:29.044 --> 01:57:29.985]  The highest quality.
[01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:34.981]  Fearless and double tough.
[01:57:34.981 --> 01:57:36.041]  Ultra 12.
[01:57:36.041 --> 01:57:37.782]  Advanced vitamin B12.

[01:59:51.324 --> 01:59:53.966]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:17.960]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:35.024]  So, your phone calls are coming up for the rest of the hour, but let me finish up with this, because I just remembered it was on my stack, and I was fumbling around for the four different articles the last two days of Democrats threatening and harassing and yelling at pro-lifers at pro-life rallies or conservative events.
[02:00:35.024 --> 02:00:39.564]  And again, the ones Friday, Sunday, and yesterday were all, hail Satan, and we love the devil.
[02:00:39.564 --> 02:00:40.985]  Can you guys pull those videos up too?
[02:00:40.985 --> 02:00:42.385]  They were in the last three days' list.
[02:00:43.971 --> 02:00:45.413]  Because again, that's what I'm saying.
[02:00:45.413 --> 02:00:47.235]  There's so much of this.
[02:00:47.235 --> 02:00:51.540]  There are so many Make America Great Again hat people.
[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:53.662]  People wearing the hats being beat up.
[02:00:53.662 --> 02:00:55.765]  I can't even watch the videos anymore.
[02:00:55.765 --> 02:00:57.487]  There's like 10 a day that I see.
[02:00:58.973 --> 02:01:02.756]  And that's... So you think the enemy attacking will make us fight back?
[02:01:02.756 --> 02:01:04.017]  No, no, no.
[02:01:04.017 --> 02:01:06.139]  There's a stratagem in different warfare systems.
[02:01:06.139 --> 02:01:15.926]  You can give it different names, but if you can get people to just get used to being attacked and submit, you can then ratchet up the attacks till they're fatal and no one cares.
[02:01:15.926 --> 02:01:17.728]  So it's getting bad, but this particular scumbag...
[02:01:19.244 --> 02:01:29.486]  This representative gets to be on Facebook, Twitter, everywhere, and publish video where he attacks young women, calling them all sorts of names, saying he's going to dox them and send people to his houses.
[02:01:29.486 --> 02:01:31.507]  What a pig creature.
[02:01:31.507 --> 02:01:36.107]  Brian Sims, this is a representative in Pennsylvania.
[02:01:36.107 --> 02:01:37.548]  Look at this bully.
[02:01:37.548 --> 02:01:38.988]  Look at this bully boy.
[02:01:38.988 --> 02:01:43.249]  But see, he's gay, so it's like Tim Cook's gay, so he can run slave factories in China.
[02:01:43.249 --> 02:01:46.930]  I don't give a rat's behind what you're shoving up your butt.
[02:01:46.930 --> 02:01:48.110]  The point is, is that
[02:01:49.503 --> 02:01:52.165]  Is it doesn't give you a little halo to harass people.
[02:01:52.165 --> 02:01:53.827]  Here it is.
[02:01:53.827 --> 02:01:59.492]  Representative Brian Sims here and I am outside the Planned Parenthood at Southeastern Pennsylvania.
[02:01:59.492 --> 02:02:00.773]  Oh no, they're leaving now.
[02:02:00.773 --> 02:02:01.434]  What we've got here...
[02:02:02.689 --> 02:02:04.871]  A bunch of protestors.
[02:02:04.871 --> 02:02:08.915]  A bunch of pseudo-christian protestors who've been out here hating young girls for being here.
[02:02:08.915 --> 02:02:09.816]  So here's the deal.
[02:02:09.816 --> 02:02:12.799]  I've got $100 to anybody who will identify any of these three.
[02:02:12.799 --> 02:02:14.661]  I'm going to donate to Planned Parenthood.
[02:02:14.661 --> 02:02:16.283]  I'm going to donate to Planned Parenthood.
[02:02:16.283 --> 02:02:23.130]  So look, a bunch of white people standing out in front of a Planned Parenthood, shaming people.
[02:02:23.130 --> 02:02:24.931]  Nothing Christian at all about what you're doing.
[02:02:25.952 --> 02:02:28.613]  Hi, nothing Christian or loving or godly about what you're doing.
[02:02:28.613 --> 02:02:40.279]  So I've got $100 to anybody who will identify $100 see if you got some friends out here 100 bucks It'd be easier if you just give me your name and your address Which way from
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:46.262]  Rich, what makes you think that it's your job to tell women what's right for their bodies?
[02:02:46.262 --> 02:02:47.663]  And the truth is, I'm not really asking.
[02:02:47.663 --> 02:02:49.404]  And now they want to kill the babies after they're born.
[02:02:49.404 --> 02:02:51.165]  Well, you have a free speech right.
[02:02:51.165 --> 02:02:52.645]  So, now he wants to dox people.
[02:02:52.645 --> 02:03:02.450]  So, here's another woman who's just coming in to talk to Planned Parenthood, where they can tell the women they can get hundreds of thousands of dollars for their babies on adoption, but they don't want you to know there's a bigger market for adoption than abortion.
[02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:03.211]  They want the babies dead.
[02:03:04.028 --> 02:03:09.794]  Like the black, uh, member of the Louisiana Senate said, we gotta kill these black babies before they get born!
[02:03:09.794 --> 02:03:11.216]  We'll have to kill them later!
[02:03:11.216 --> 02:03:12.477]  In fact, cue that up!
[02:03:12.477 --> 02:03:14.980]  But, uh, here he is going after the lady, calling her all sorts of names.
[02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:17.182]  About Planned Parenthood.
[02:03:17.182 --> 02:03:20.926]  Shaming people for something that they have a constitutional right to do.
[02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:21.227]  Huh?
[02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:21.387]  Huh?
[02:03:22.382 --> 02:03:23.483]  Yes, it's 1974.
[02:03:23.483 --> 02:03:25.284]  You can cry at home for children.
[02:03:25.284 --> 02:03:27.445]  It's probably the same place that you could feed a child.
[02:03:27.445 --> 02:03:28.686]  But you're not.
[02:03:28.686 --> 02:03:32.668]  Instead, you're out here shaming people for something that they have a constitutional right to do.
[02:03:32.668 --> 02:03:38.192]  Who would have thought that an old white lady would be out in front of a Planned Parenthood telling people what's right for their bodies?
[02:03:38.912 --> 02:03:39.272]  Shame on you.
[02:03:39.272 --> 02:03:40.993]  That evil white lady that wanted to kill all the black babies.
[02:03:40.993 --> 02:03:43.414]  Shame on you for hiding your face at the same time that you're shaming other people.
[02:03:43.414 --> 02:03:44.154]  Now here's the difference.
[02:03:44.154 --> 02:03:49.437]  Again, the same... This thug has a right to harass this lady on the street as free speech.
[02:03:49.437 --> 02:03:51.058]  She's involved in political action.
[02:03:51.058 --> 02:03:53.579]  She can be harassed to the point where she gets in her car.
[02:03:53.579 --> 02:04:02.443]  The young ladies he tried to dox, that's really a terroristic stalking event and is illegal in basically any jurisdiction.
[02:04:02.443 --> 02:04:04.344]  Especially if somebody gets hurt.
[02:04:04.344 --> 02:04:05.064]  That's what he acts on.
[02:04:07.145 --> 02:04:20.659]  But he's acting like they're bad for being out and if you try to go out to Planned Parenthood, I've seen this on Facebook or Twitter, and you try to just nicely talk about the babies and how they're viable, you get banned because that's hateful because you're trying to get rid of somebody's right.
[02:04:20.659 --> 02:04:22.241]  These authoritarians are incredible.
[02:04:22.241 --> 02:04:25.985]  The left wants children dead and wants their organs harvested.
[02:04:25.985 --> 02:04:27.407]  Let's go out to break with this thug.
[02:04:29.346 --> 02:04:30.746]  Does it protect me?
[02:04:30.746 --> 02:04:32.487]  Protect you, and that's okay.
[02:04:32.487 --> 02:04:33.807]  You're allowed to be out here.
[02:04:33.807 --> 02:04:37.187]  That doesn't mean you have any moral right to be out here.
[02:04:37.187 --> 02:04:37.828]  Shame on you.
[02:04:37.828 --> 02:04:39.828]  What you're doing here is disgusting.
[02:04:39.828 --> 02:04:40.788]  This is wrong.
[02:04:40.788 --> 02:04:42.949]  You have no business being out here.
[02:04:42.949 --> 02:04:46.009]  You have no business being out here.
[02:04:46.009 --> 02:04:48.890]  Yep, disgusting.
[02:04:48.890 --> 02:04:50.050]  So do me a favor, please.
[02:04:50.050 --> 02:04:55.371]  If you're watching this, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania is one of the most heavily protested- We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:04:56.274 --> 02:05:01.699]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[02:05:01.699 --> 02:05:03.480]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:05.242]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[02:05:05.242 --> 02:05:07.083]  Now, I can make them strong.
[02:05:07.083 --> 02:05:08.725]  Now, I can instruct them.
[02:05:08.725 --> 02:05:11.447]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[02:05:11.547 --> 02:05:16.670]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[02:05:16.670 --> 02:05:22.274]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[02:05:22.274 --> 02:05:25.917]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[02:05:25.917 --> 02:05:30.900]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:37.785]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[02:05:37.785 --> 02:05:41.447]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[02:05:41.547 --> 02:05:49.154]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[02:05:49.154 --> 02:05:55.781]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[02:06:12.853 --> 02:06:18.602]  From the front lines, from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:18.602 --> 02:06:27.495]  You know, I grabbed this off an old TV's greatest hits music that I bought in like 1990 or something.
[02:06:29.207 --> 02:06:31.347]  And it's not the best quality.
[02:06:31.347 --> 02:06:35.228]  I heard a Hawaii 5-0 of this on YouTube the other day.
[02:06:35.228 --> 02:06:38.669]  We should re-download and play it, where it just sounds so crisp and so good.
[02:06:38.669 --> 02:06:41.470]  Except that big band song.
[02:06:41.470 --> 02:06:44.110]  It's kind of a redo of the music they had in the 20s and 30s and 40s.
[02:06:44.110 --> 02:06:46.431]  Imagine a 30-piece band playing something like this.
[02:06:46.431 --> 02:06:51.172]  Crank it up.
[02:06:51.172 --> 02:06:52.232]  Camperson's Elma Garrett.
[02:07:02.856 --> 02:07:11.439]  See, everything in the news, and this is about you, it's not about me, is how I'm a loser, how I'm failing, how I'm being banned on this, how I'm being sued for that.
[02:07:11.439 --> 02:07:18.941]  All, like, if you're Americana, if you believe in freedom, if you believe in the right to keep and bear arms, if you believe in God and family, you're losing.
[02:07:18.941 --> 02:07:21.022]  No, I'm winning.
[02:07:21.022 --> 02:07:22.222]  And our audience is winning.
[02:07:22.222 --> 02:07:23.322]  We are the tip of the spear.
[02:07:23.322 --> 02:07:26.323]  We are the vaunted 1776 Worldwide.
[02:07:26.323 --> 02:07:27.984]  And I don't tell you that to puff you up, folks.
[02:07:29.542 --> 02:07:37.007]  Came out in big league politics 45 minutes ago that Hillary Clinton is quarterbacking my deplatforming.
[02:07:37.007 --> 02:07:38.188]  Her staff members.
[02:07:38.188 --> 02:07:40.109]  Of course she is.
[02:07:40.109 --> 02:07:43.491]  She's still planning to run.
[02:07:43.491 --> 02:07:46.233]  Or at least broker some convention deal like she's the kingmaker.
[02:07:48.956 --> 02:07:50.356]  That's why they're trying to shut us down.
[02:07:50.356 --> 02:07:53.017]  That's why they're censoring so much to kill populism.
[02:07:53.017 --> 02:07:57.319]  I've got the German president came out and said censor all the populists from America to Germany.
[02:07:57.319 --> 02:07:59.539]  Shut them up or our new world order is going to fail!
[02:07:59.539 --> 02:08:08.902]  Alright, I'm going to go to your phone calls for the rest of the hour, right now, asking what does Trump need to do, but what are we going to do?
[02:08:08.902 --> 02:08:16.785]  Because I can tell you right now, I got busy yesterday, didn't go in there with my writers, didn't get some of the older Infowars.com posters where we've had
[02:08:17.762 --> 02:08:31.553]  Operations where we put the posters up, people print them off, in black and white or in color, and just say, vaccines can kill, research it for yourself, InfoWars.com.
[02:08:31.553 --> 02:08:33.835]  Well, the insert says they can kill you.
[02:08:33.835 --> 02:08:36.797]  You put those up around town, it's gonna be on the news.
[02:08:36.797 --> 02:08:42.761]  You get people to read the inserts, you get people to visit InfoWars.com, you save lives.
[02:08:42.761 --> 02:08:45.664]  Or, it's okay to be Alex Jones, or free Alex Jones.
[02:08:46.758 --> 02:08:47.278]  Infowars.com
[02:09:05.706 --> 02:09:16.495]  I took a vaccine when I was 14 and it almost killed me, but despite that, we gave our newborn son rounds of shots and at 18 months, he went into convulsions and has been in a coma for two years.
[02:09:16.495 --> 02:09:20.998]  I wish I'd have seen your flyers before, but I put up 500 of them in St.
[02:09:20.998 --> 02:09:25.682]  Louis last week and I had some people thanking me and some threatening me.
[02:09:25.682 --> 02:09:27.804]  That's a real phone call I got.
[02:09:27.804 --> 02:09:32.147]  And you know, I've been asked by people around here not to tell these stories and I won't.
[02:09:32.147 --> 02:09:33.008]  But let me just tell you something.
[02:09:36.573 --> 02:09:44.319]  You need to stand up, and I know you are, but instead of just listening, I know most of you are taking action.
[02:09:44.319 --> 02:09:49.343]  You need to, we need to create a whole smattering, make it easy for you.
[02:09:49.343 --> 02:09:52.506]  Or maybe people can send in to showtipsatinfowars.com.
[02:09:52.506 --> 02:09:54.007]  Ooh, that's the answer.
[02:09:54.007 --> 02:09:56.629]  Images that are, what's the size of a piece of paper?
[02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:59.812]  I forget what these are, what are these?
[02:09:59.812 --> 02:10:00.672]  Eight and a half by 11.
[02:10:00.672 --> 02:10:03.054]  That's all you gotta do.
[02:10:03.054 --> 02:10:04.736]  And you can just say vaccines kill.
[02:10:06.038 --> 02:10:27.332]  And then just say, it's known that you can get learned immunity from attenuated viruses and bacteria, but it's admitted in the lengthy inserts that come with the shots that are never given to the patients by the nurses or doctors, that it can give you hundreds of different disorders, including cancer, Guillain-Barre, narcolepsy, and death.
[02:10:27.332 --> 02:10:29.553]  And it can cause type 1 diabetes.
[02:10:29.553 --> 02:10:30.534]  It eats your pancreas.
[02:10:34.428 --> 02:10:37.249]  I mean, that's in the damn inserts.
[02:10:37.249 --> 02:10:43.011]  Now, I mean, I'm not a Mr. Angel Cakes here.
[02:10:43.011 --> 02:10:43.531]  But you know what?
[02:10:43.531 --> 02:10:50.914]  When I see pregnant women in the grocery store with their husband, I have this thing about not messing with the woman when they're out with her husband.
[02:10:50.914 --> 02:10:53.115]  And, you know, obviously she's taken, she's pregnant.
[02:10:53.115 --> 02:10:58.336]  It's creepy if a guy walks over to some woman in the ice cream aisle, you know, and she's wanting some ice cream because she's nine months pregnant.
[02:10:58.336 --> 02:10:59.697]  And I just say, hey, listen.
[02:11:01.658 --> 02:11:05.880]  I'm not getting in your business because I want anything or I'm with any group.
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:10.521]  I've got children, and I wish somebody would have warned me and my family early on and warned others.
[02:11:10.521 --> 02:11:13.142]  I have a lot of friends that have had their kids hurt and died.
[02:11:13.142 --> 02:11:16.424]  Don't believe me, ask for the insert with the vaccines.
[02:11:16.424 --> 02:11:30.709]  And almost every time, the woman and their husband say, either, oh, we know you, we've actually, we're debating her mom or my dad about that, or no, no, we've got friends that, yeah, well, what, where, yeah, I went into Walgreens and they gave me a fact sheet.
[02:11:31.986 --> 02:11:34.528]  And it said it was fine, but you're right, there's an insert.
[02:11:34.528 --> 02:11:35.949]  I'm like, yeah!
[02:11:35.949 --> 02:11:41.814]  Well, do you know about the Vaccine Damage Court they set up in 1984 to cover up millions of brain damaged?
[02:11:41.814 --> 02:11:45.097]  And they're like, no!
[02:11:45.097 --> 02:11:58.087]  If there was a well out in the, let's say, the desert, and wagon trains were coming through, and there was a little town before you went into the desert, and you know, went down through Nevada into Utah, and you knew that 20 miles out there, there was a
[02:11:59.326 --> 02:12:07.988]  a spring that people might think was good that had arsenic in it, you'd probably ride out there and put a sign up saying don't drink that water.
[02:12:07.988 --> 02:12:10.389]  Just because it's a normal thing, it's what you do.
[02:12:10.389 --> 02:12:16.030]  And you'd be still worried when you saw a sweet family coming through that sometimes those signs blow over.
[02:12:16.030 --> 02:12:24.972]  And you'd say, hey listen, out at Dry Gulch, about 15 miles through the valley, off the road, you'll see water.
[02:12:24.972 --> 02:12:28.473]  Don't drink it or give it to your horses, it's bad water, bitter water.
[02:12:29.386 --> 02:12:35.807]  Make sure you take plenty of water with you before you go to the valley.
[02:12:35.807 --> 02:12:45.330]  Humans are supposed to not be busybodying, tattling on their neighbors for crap to the government, but you're supposed to be helping each other.
[02:12:45.330 --> 02:12:55.692]  And I get so exhausted, I'm going to your calls next segment, so exhausted being here on air and after I make all the decisions and do all these things.
[02:12:57.281 --> 02:13:04.249]  That I have only so many decisions I can make during the day and then my brain goes, it's done.
[02:13:04.249 --> 02:13:05.050]  But I commit.
[02:13:06.684 --> 02:13:09.185]  That just is a symbol of what needs to be done.
[02:13:09.185 --> 02:13:11.567]  We're going to put these posters up in the next few days.
[02:13:11.567 --> 02:13:16.210]  We're going to send in your posters, whatever political idea or slogan or thing you have.
[02:13:16.210 --> 02:13:19.331]  And we'll post them all up to InfoWars.com on a page.
[02:13:19.331 --> 02:13:20.992]  People can download them and print them.
[02:13:20.992 --> 02:13:30.138]  And then let's all just, whether small town, whether you're in England or New Zealand or Mexico or the US, wherever you are, let's go print those suckers off and let Zuckerberg
[02:13:30.538 --> 02:13:44.467]  And let Apple and all their slave factories in China, let them know, man, you may think you control this universe, but you don't control the third dimension and you're not gonna stop us from getting the truth out.
[02:13:44.467 --> 02:13:46.388]  Do you understand me?
[02:13:46.388 --> 02:13:54.513]  It's simple.
[02:13:54.513 --> 02:13:55.694]  When you go out to a lake,
[02:13:59.878 --> 02:14:04.800]  And there's rocks in certain spots, they place buoys on them.
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:08.402]  But in this modern world, they've removed all the buoys.
[02:14:08.402 --> 02:14:14.504]  And they tell you, take all the psychotropics, smoke all the marijuana, do whatever you want, have a good time.
[02:14:14.504 --> 02:14:16.005]  And I'm a libertarian.
[02:14:16.005 --> 02:14:23.568]  I think you shouldn't go to prison for it, but let me explain something.
[02:14:23.568 --> 02:14:25.209]  I have known in the last 30 years
[02:14:28.306 --> 02:14:35.928]  About a third of the people that smoke marijuana on a routine basis become schizophrenic.
[02:14:35.928 --> 02:14:39.169]  And I talked about that in court one time when they brought up, do I ever smoke marijuana?
[02:14:39.169 --> 02:14:41.610]  And I said, yeah, about once a year to test it.
[02:14:41.610 --> 02:14:43.450]  And everybody thought that was funny.
[02:14:43.450 --> 02:14:45.111]  I don't like it.
[02:14:45.111 --> 02:14:46.691]  I don't like feeling fear.
[02:14:46.691 --> 02:14:48.191]  I never feel fear unless I smoke marijuana.
[02:14:48.191 --> 02:14:48.992]  Then I get all paranoid.
[02:14:48.992 --> 02:14:51.852]  A lot of folks have that effect.
[02:14:51.852 --> 02:14:55.213]  But I said that marijuana in some studies is up to 60 to 70, sometimes 100 times stronger
[02:14:58.376 --> 02:15:01.817]  Let's say Mexican brown weed folks were smoking in the 60s.
[02:15:01.817 --> 02:15:04.818]  Had to smoke two joints to get a buzz.
[02:15:04.818 --> 02:15:07.939]  They said in the marijuana, George Washington was smoking his pipe for a toothache.
[02:15:07.939 --> 02:15:10.260]  It's got a lot of great effects.
[02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:15.142]  It is a brain damaging weapon now.
[02:15:15.142 --> 02:15:19.283]  Schizophrenia and marijuana, trigger or treatment.
[02:15:19.283 --> 02:15:21.984]  And folks, I know so many people
[02:15:23.331 --> 02:15:29.512]  Who become full-blown paranoid lunatics on marijuana.
[02:15:29.512 --> 02:15:32.213]  I'm going to take your calls in the last segment with the marijuana stuff.
[02:15:32.213 --> 02:15:35.133]  But just like I told you 20-something years ago, aspartame is eating people's brains.
[02:15:35.133 --> 02:15:36.334]  It was in the study.
[02:15:36.334 --> 02:15:37.374]  This is serious.
[02:15:37.374 --> 02:15:39.934]  And the marijuana is genetically engineered now.
[02:15:39.934 --> 02:15:41.175]  It's weaponized.
[02:15:41.175 --> 02:15:47.996]  And you can take one hit of the stuff they sell in California at corner stores, and you can't get out of your chair for an hour.
[02:15:47.996 --> 02:15:50.817]  This stuff is narcotics, period.
[02:15:55.299 --> 02:15:59.322]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[02:15:59.322 --> 02:16:02.665]  Hey guys, it's Scott Bauer here, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.

[02:16:55.307 --> 02:16:57.669]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[02:16:57.669 --> 02:17:00.531]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[02:17:00.531 --> 02:17:05.615]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:17:05.615 --> 02:17:12.801]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:17:12.801 --> 02:17:17.345]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:17:17.925 --> 02:17:21.588]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:17:21.588 --> 02:17:24.711]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:17:24.711 --> 02:17:27.333]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:17:27.333 --> 02:17:28.834]  Get sober now.
[02:17:28.834 --> 02:17:32.177]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[02:17:32.177 --> 02:17:32.977]  It's simple.

[02:17:38.962 --> 02:17:39.022]  800-213-9264.
[02:17:39.022 --> 02:17:39.102]  800-213-9264.
[02:17:39.102 --> 02:17:40.583]  Call right now before it's too late.
[02:17:40.583 --> 02:17:40.643]  800-213-9264.
[02:17:40.643 --> 02:17:42.765]  I wanna say brain force is great.
[02:17:42.765 --> 02:17:44.626]  I wanna say turbo force is amazing.
[02:17:44.626 --> 02:17:44.926]  It is!
[02:17:44.926 --> 02:17:46.467]  But if you took it with bish oil...
[02:18:04.094 --> 02:18:04.214]  It's
[02:18:20.461 --> 02:18:25.683]  Children's are really strong, they don't give you the burpees, but krill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:18:25.683 --> 02:18:28.504]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[02:18:28.504 --> 02:18:31.646]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[02:18:31.646 --> 02:18:33.967]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:18:33.967 --> 02:18:36.688]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[02:18:36.688 --> 02:18:40.069]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:18:40.069 --> 02:18:44.631]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:18:47.588 --> 02:18:53.471]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:18:53.471 --> 02:18:56.692]  I just can't do it!
[02:18:56.692 --> 02:19:01.274]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[02:19:01.274 --> 02:19:03.295]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[02:19:03.295 --> 02:19:04.395]  Good to talk to you.
[02:19:04.395 --> 02:19:09.037]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[02:19:09.037 --> 02:19:10.978]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[02:19:10.978 --> 02:19:13.699]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic.
[02:19:13.699 --> 02:19:15.520]  Root, things like that, that I trust.
[02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:22.566]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[02:19:22.566 --> 02:19:24.168]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[02:19:24.168 --> 02:19:24.768]  Tell us about it.
[02:19:24.768 --> 02:19:25.549]  Well, it's really great.
[02:19:25.549 --> 02:19:27.351]  You know, it's like a multivitamin, I take it.
[02:19:27.351 --> 02:19:28.091]  It tastes good.
[02:19:28.091 --> 02:19:29.953]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[02:19:29.953 --> 02:19:31.915]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[02:19:31.915 --> 02:19:35.358]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[02:19:35.418 --> 02:19:38.239]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[02:19:38.239 --> 02:19:39.999]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[02:19:39.999 --> 02:19:42.059]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[02:19:42.059 --> 02:19:45.420]  So yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[02:19:45.420 --> 02:19:48.260]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:49.401]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[02:19:49.401 --> 02:19:50.481]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:19:50.481 --> 02:19:51.881]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:16.941]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:16.941 --> 02:20:20.064]  We're going right to your phone calls right now.
[02:20:20.064 --> 02:20:22.987]  And then I'm going to get later in the next segment, just for a minute or so.
[02:20:22.987 --> 02:20:33.436]  Nigel Farage has been attacked all over the European Union, in the Financial Times of London, in The Guardian.
[02:20:33.436 --> 02:20:41.384]  That's right, for association with good old Alex Jones, because now that Facebook has waved their magic wand and said I'm a terrorist and anti-Semite,
[02:20:43.188 --> 02:20:44.549]  Well, anyone I ever talked to is.
[02:20:44.549 --> 02:20:46.429]  See how the lie just dominoes?
[02:20:46.429 --> 02:20:49.050]  What a criminal group of people.
[02:20:49.050 --> 02:20:50.591]  Right now, let's go to phone calls.
[02:20:50.591 --> 02:20:52.431]  We're going to get everybody on the board here.
[02:20:52.431 --> 02:20:53.952]  Let's go to Brie.
[02:20:53.952 --> 02:20:57.813]  Brie calling from the great state of Somalia.
[02:20:57.813 --> 02:21:01.895]  I'm sorry, the great state of Saudi Arabia.
[02:21:01.895 --> 02:21:04.216]  I'm sorry, the great state of Minnesota.
[02:21:04.216 --> 02:21:04.796]  You're on the air.
[02:21:04.796 --> 02:21:06.376]  Welcome, Brie.
[02:21:06.376 --> 02:21:07.777]  Thank you.
[02:21:07.777 --> 02:21:08.077]  Welcome.
[02:21:09.505 --> 02:21:20.955]  Yeah, so I think one thing that's really important here is we're trying to get people informed about what's going on between censorship and people not getting accurate information.
[02:21:20.955 --> 02:21:36.388]  I think it's really important for people to continue to connect with each other on an individual basis because part of achieving their agendas is people in power separating the people from each other and creating divisiveness.
[02:21:38.092 --> 02:21:40.213]  Is how they're going to get what they want.
[02:21:40.213 --> 02:21:45.836]  And I think in that too, there's a real opportunity to find common language.
[02:21:45.836 --> 02:21:53.100]  And specifically, you know, comes to mind when you have people advocating for abortion rights.
[02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:57.483]  There's the slogan of, you know, my body, my choice, hands off my body.
[02:21:57.483 --> 02:22:01.825]  Well, how about hands off my brain, hands off my mind?
[02:22:01.825 --> 02:22:06.908]  I have a real problem with people saying what ideas are appropriate.
[02:22:07.662 --> 02:22:10.525]  For my, you know, feeble lady brain to be consuming.
[02:22:10.525 --> 02:22:19.333]  I was about to say, how elitist, how cultic is it to have Facebook and others saying, you can't say Alex Jones, you can't look at his site unless it's negative.
[02:22:19.333 --> 02:22:20.454]  You're too weak minded.
[02:22:20.454 --> 02:22:23.336]  We, the elite, are going to tell you what you can see.
[02:22:23.336 --> 02:22:26.099]  That is so cultic.
[02:22:26.099 --> 02:22:30.443]  It's ridiculous and it's completely an affront
[02:22:30.871 --> 02:22:35.454]  To our freedom of speech and our constitution and what our country was built on.
[02:22:35.454 --> 02:22:40.556]  And a precious price has been paid for us to live in a land with those rights.
[02:22:40.556 --> 02:22:48.341]  I mean, every soldier, sailor and Marine who's ever sacrificed, served, has paid a price to uphold that for you.
[02:22:48.341 --> 02:22:55.945]  Every person in parts of the world who has been born, lived and died under bondage, true bondage and oppression.
[02:22:57.143 --> 02:23:00.566]  It's awful and we have to stand up for each other, not just
[02:23:21.132 --> 02:23:30.994]  Those that we agree with, but you have to reach out and express that you're standing up for all people's right to say what they want.
[02:23:30.994 --> 02:23:34.955]  Because it's... Well, Brie, it sounds like you're a classical Americana liberal.
[02:23:34.955 --> 02:23:35.955]  We don't have room for you.
[02:23:35.955 --> 02:23:37.335]  God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[02:23:37.335 --> 02:23:40.436]  It's just crazy how in America this is, how dangerous it is.
[02:23:40.436 --> 02:23:45.277]  Communist China last year, last January, almost a year and a half ago now, praised
[02:23:46.806 --> 02:23:49.869]  The quote, fake news movement and banning conservatives and people.
[02:23:49.869 --> 02:23:51.411]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:23:51.411 --> 02:23:55.796]  Again, the German president just came out and said, ban all populists.
[02:23:55.796 --> 02:23:59.280]  Just ban everybody.
[02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:01.102]  Incredible.
[02:24:01.102 --> 02:24:03.985]  Let's go ahead and talk to another fine lady.
[02:24:03.985 --> 02:24:07.809]  Kristen in the great state of Governor Cuomo.
[02:24:07.809 --> 02:24:08.110]  Go ahead.
[02:24:09.226 --> 02:24:10.347]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:10.347 --> 02:24:11.989]  I'm a listener for the last three years.
[02:24:11.989 --> 02:24:12.789]  I love your show.
[02:24:12.789 --> 02:24:13.310]  Thank you for calling.
[02:24:13.310 --> 02:24:14.451]  I love what you stand for.
[02:24:14.451 --> 02:24:15.872]  Thank you, ma'am.
[02:24:15.872 --> 02:24:17.173]  I just want to answer you.
[02:24:17.173 --> 02:24:19.756]  You put out the question about what can we do?
[02:24:19.756 --> 02:24:20.797]  How do we get to Trump?
[02:24:20.797 --> 02:24:25.861]  What do we need to get these techno crap companies under control?
[02:24:25.861 --> 02:24:32.928]  Well, one thing we need is term limits for all these people who make a life out of serving people that they don't serve.
[02:24:34.195 --> 02:24:34.996]  They get money.
[02:24:34.996 --> 02:24:36.677]  They have backdoor deals.
[02:24:36.677 --> 02:24:38.859]  We have no say in our government.
[02:24:38.859 --> 02:24:40.300]  I live in New York.
[02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:46.445]  I am surrounded by people who think that they know what the Constitution stands for.
[02:24:46.445 --> 02:24:47.766]  And it's a disgrace.
[02:24:47.766 --> 02:24:48.866]  And I'm ready to leave.
[02:24:48.866 --> 02:24:50.387]  But I have my family.
[02:24:50.387 --> 02:24:51.869]  I have my job.
[02:24:51.869 --> 02:24:53.570]  And it really... No, I understand.
[02:24:53.570 --> 02:24:54.430]  I saw numbers that...
[02:24:55.591 --> 02:24:59.953]  42% of people living in New York City, they said they want to get out in the next year.
[02:24:59.953 --> 02:25:02.254]  Something like 30% of the people in the state.
[02:25:02.254 --> 02:25:05.996]  It's a beautiful state in many areas, a great American pastime.
[02:25:05.996 --> 02:25:08.557]  New York, when I get there, I feel a lot of energy, I have a good feeling in the city.
[02:25:08.557 --> 02:25:12.159]  I feel like I'm going to die in LA and San Francisco.
[02:25:12.159 --> 02:25:14.920]  But I mean, New York has its evil, but it also has its good.
[02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:20.321]  And you saw Governor Cuomo say last year, if you're pro-life or pro-gun, get out of the state.
[02:25:20.321 --> 02:25:23.762]  What are they going to do as everybody that's a producer leaves?
[02:25:23.762 --> 02:25:25.142]  They admit it's already falling apart.
[02:25:25.142 --> 02:25:26.103]  What are they thinking?
[02:25:26.103 --> 02:25:28.703]  He just legalized killing already born babies.
[02:25:28.703 --> 02:25:29.263]  That's right.
[02:25:29.263 --> 02:25:31.204]  And we're a pro-gun family.
[02:25:31.204 --> 02:25:32.824]  We're a pro-Constitution family.
[02:25:32.824 --> 02:25:34.985]  My family's been here for generations.
[02:25:34.985 --> 02:25:36.605]  Why do I have to leave?
[02:25:36.605 --> 02:25:39.786]  Why doesn't he represent the people he's supposed to be serving?
[02:25:39.786 --> 02:25:40.646]  All of us.
[02:25:40.646 --> 02:25:44.627]  Not just the select that he takes money from and has deals with.
[02:25:44.847 --> 02:25:48.168]  Did you see when they signed that bill to kill babies after they're born?
[02:25:48.168 --> 02:25:51.909]  How he and others literally almost had an orgasm and smiled and laughed?
[02:25:51.909 --> 02:25:54.249]  They were clapping and cheering!
[02:25:54.249 --> 02:25:55.230]  What are they cheering for?
[02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:56.030]  The decimation of the human race?
[02:25:56.030 --> 02:25:57.590]  It was a demonic celebration!
[02:25:57.590 --> 02:26:00.451]  He looked like the Gremlins from I Am Legend.
[02:26:00.451 --> 02:26:02.551]  Remember that Tom Cruise movie?
[02:26:02.551 --> 02:26:03.051]  Yes.
[02:26:03.051 --> 02:26:11.754]  They literally go... It's gonna be sweet as pie when I kill that unicorn.
[02:26:11.754 --> 02:26:13.274]  And baby that Edison.
[02:26:15.290 --> 02:26:17.431]  I mean, they are the archetypal demons.
[02:26:17.431 --> 02:26:20.813]  You cannot... But you know, there's a consensus forming that they're demons.
[02:26:20.813 --> 02:26:23.755]  Everybody I know now, everybody, from you name it, goes, they're demons.
[02:26:23.755 --> 02:26:24.995]  They're literal demons.
[02:26:24.995 --> 02:26:35.321]  I know people that were atheists who now believe these people are demon-possessed, because they used to know people who were normal liberals, and now they're like, I like to kill babies.
[02:26:35.321 --> 02:26:37.422]  I mean, what do you think's happened to these people?
[02:26:38.446 --> 02:26:39.787]  I think that I agree with you.
[02:26:39.787 --> 02:26:40.908]  I think they are possessed.
[02:26:40.908 --> 02:26:46.894]  I think there's something really going on under the whole spiritual realm and we are in trouble.
[02:26:46.894 --> 02:26:57.263]  And if we don't stick together and we can't get the word to Trump, we need some kind of an executive order that puts some of these politicians will get on it and they will serve for term limits.
[02:26:57.263 --> 02:26:59.945]  But the rest of them will never vote for term limits.
[02:27:00.425 --> 02:27:01.327]  Oh, and here's the deal.
[02:27:01.327 --> 02:27:02.588]  We're not just demonizing them.
[02:27:16.445 --> 02:27:36.417]  I go to Democratic events, and I used to go to Democrat events when I was anti-war, which I still am if it's offensive, and I wasn't for the Republicans or the Democrats, and they were still a little neurotic and a little weird and worshipping radical Islam and still pro-abortion and like the men were all real weird and the women were weird, but still there wasn't an open demonicness.
[02:27:36.417 --> 02:27:37.697]  There were some nice people.
[02:27:37.697 --> 02:27:41.940]  You go to Democrat events now, you're like, are we at a body snatcher convention?
[02:27:42.881 --> 02:27:47.673]  Because, I mean, they're almost all look like they escaped from a mental institution.
[02:27:47.673 --> 02:27:49.437]  I don't feel good seeing them like that.
[02:27:49.437 --> 02:27:50.660]  I don't feel elitist.
[02:27:50.660 --> 02:27:52.044]  Something happened to them.
[02:27:52.995 --> 02:27:54.216]  I think they're all on medication.
[02:27:54.216 --> 02:27:59.199]  I think they're all on the pharmaceutical medication and they are being controlled.
[02:27:59.199 --> 02:28:01.741]  I can't even have conversation with some family members.
[02:28:01.741 --> 02:28:02.602]  They're out of control.
[02:28:02.602 --> 02:28:08.506]  They can't sit down and have a normal conversation based on facts, discussing things that are important.
[02:28:08.506 --> 02:28:11.828]  What if the founding fathers never sat down and had a conversation?
[02:28:11.828 --> 02:28:13.670]  Our country would never be what it is today.
[02:28:14.290 --> 02:28:16.472]  And this is what a disgrace it's become.
[02:28:16.472 --> 02:28:22.278]  It's become, oh, it's, you can't talk about politics, you can't talk about religion, you can't, what am I supposed to talk about?
[02:28:22.278 --> 02:28:23.659]  The Kardashians?
[02:28:23.659 --> 02:28:25.040]  This is important?
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:26.662]  This is not important?
[02:28:26.662 --> 02:28:28.683]  And this is what they've made our country into?
[02:28:28.683 --> 02:28:38.953]  It's almost a partial joke, and I'm sad to say that, because I love America, and I love my country, and I feel like we're, it's being stolen from us right from under our feet.
[02:28:38.953 --> 02:28:39.894]  Right from under our feet.
[02:28:40.879 --> 02:28:44.642]  And I'm fed up, and I know many people are fed up, but some people... No, I hear you, ma'am.
[02:28:44.642 --> 02:28:46.864]  Look, this is a power cult.
[02:28:46.864 --> 02:28:48.646]  They will end up getting defeated.
[02:28:48.646 --> 02:28:49.126]  There you go.
[02:28:49.126 --> 02:28:51.368]  That's what average Democrats look like right there on screen.
[02:28:51.368 --> 02:28:53.090]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:53.090 --> 02:28:55.212]  We must destroy the innocents.
[02:28:55.212 --> 02:28:59.776]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:59.776 --> 02:29:01.878]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:01.878 --> 02:29:03.199]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:03.579 --> 02:29:10.143]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:10.143 --> 02:29:15.225]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:15.225 --> 02:29:19.908]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:20.348 --> 02:29:23.469]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[02:33:17.657 --> 02:33:26.481]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.481 --> 02:33:27.842]  Last night a little angel
[02:33:29.065 --> 02:33:31.687]  I got a license for love.
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:34:00.063]  Rain hell from above!
[02:34:00.063 --> 02:34:01.523]  We're rebels.
[02:34:01.523 --> 02:34:07.685]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:34:07.685 --> 02:34:11.386]  It's good acoustic.
[02:34:11.386 --> 02:34:12.726]  Billy Idol's amazing in concert.
[02:34:12.726 --> 02:34:14.226]  Incredible.
[02:34:14.226 --> 02:34:16.307]  Alright, what should we go to here right now?
[02:34:18.431 --> 02:34:20.712]  Moe, Moe, Moe!
[02:34:20.712 --> 02:34:21.412]  Oh, he's a listener, too.
[02:34:21.412 --> 02:34:22.593]  I never told you that.
[02:34:22.593 --> 02:34:28.115]  I'm not going to get into the story, but I'm just telling you how popular Freedom is, folks.
[02:34:28.115 --> 02:34:30.976]  How popular Freedom is.
[02:34:30.976 --> 02:34:32.856]  You know, Matthew Bellamy's a huge listener.
[02:34:32.856 --> 02:34:33.897]  Woke him up.
[02:34:33.897 --> 02:34:35.617]  Had him on the show a few times.
[02:34:35.617 --> 02:34:40.379]  And then a couple years after that, it doesn't matter that he's a rock star, but they do make some great music.
[02:34:41.334 --> 02:34:45.015]  Like that one song he does about, uh, never use that as bumper music.
[02:34:45.015 --> 02:34:52.697]  What's that famous Bellamy song, Muse song, where it's about, uh, rise up, take the power back.
[02:34:52.697 --> 02:34:56.497]  That was all inspired by Infowars and his own great brain.
[02:34:56.497 --> 02:35:01.298]  Then they threatened his future record contracts and being able to sing at stadiums.
[02:35:01.298 --> 02:35:03.839]  So he renounced us.
[02:35:03.839 --> 02:35:04.659]  Not the mean wage.
[02:35:04.659 --> 02:35:07.120]  He said, well, I'm not that now.
[02:35:07.120 --> 02:35:07.600]  That's fine.
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:09.480]  But Ted Nugent didn't.
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:11.801]  Ted Nugent would make 15 to 20 million dollars more a year.
[02:35:11.801 --> 02:35:15.522]  He said he basically just breaks even and takes care of everybody.
[02:35:15.522 --> 02:35:17.983]  Because he can't sing at any corporate event.
[02:35:17.983 --> 02:35:23.565]  He has to go at VFWs or city-owned coliseums because he's pro-gun.
[02:35:23.565 --> 02:35:28.167]  And I'm just saying, think about what we have to pay in this country.
[02:35:28.167 --> 02:35:30.547]  How we have to be bankrupted to have free speech.
[02:35:30.547 --> 02:35:34.049]  So you can't blame Bellamy.
[02:35:34.049 --> 02:35:35.109]  What is that new song?
[02:35:36.354 --> 02:35:36.834]  Uprising.
[02:35:36.834 --> 02:35:40.217]  Let's play some of that when we come back in the next segment.
[02:35:40.217 --> 02:35:41.318]  But let's go to your calls right now.
[02:35:41.318 --> 02:35:43.800]  Now, I just took two calls, gave them both like 10 minutes.
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:44.681]  You're awesome, folks.
[02:35:44.681 --> 02:35:46.262]  You're great callers.
[02:35:46.262 --> 02:35:47.724]  We gotta give each person like a minute and a half.
[02:35:47.724 --> 02:35:49.885]  We won't get to everybody.
[02:35:49.885 --> 02:35:56.511]  So I'm gonna go to Nick, who's been holding the longest, then Dave, then Keith, and I'll just go right through who's been holding the longest.
[02:35:56.511 --> 02:35:58.032]  Nick in Michigan, thanks for calling.
[02:35:58.032 --> 02:35:58.633]  You're on the air.
[02:35:58.633 --> 02:35:59.714]  Welcome.
[02:35:59.714 --> 02:36:00.675]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[02:36:00.675 --> 02:36:01.956]  It's an honor to talk to you.
[02:36:01.956 --> 02:36:03.737]  It's a first-time caller as well.
[02:36:03.737 --> 02:36:04.578]  Honor to talk to you, man.
[02:36:05.559 --> 02:36:10.622]  Um, I just want to do, uh, you asked the question about what Trump and Congress is going to be doing.
[02:36:10.622 --> 02:36:13.464]  You think about this whole big tech situation.
[02:36:13.464 --> 02:36:18.647]  And in my honest opinion, I know it is, it is really, really messed up right now with it.
[02:36:18.647 --> 02:36:21.528]  Just every silencing and everything.
[02:36:21.528 --> 02:36:26.351]  But I'm telling you, I think it's going to get even worse within the next few years.
[02:36:26.351 --> 02:36:31.274]  And I think once, once Trump is reelected, which will God willing happen.
[02:36:31.923 --> 02:36:35.587]  I do think that that's when he is going to finally make a move on it.
[02:36:35.587 --> 02:36:42.093]  But right now, with everything else that's going on, I mean, there's just so much going on.
[02:36:42.093 --> 02:36:43.054]  Don't get me wrong.
[02:36:43.054 --> 02:36:43.614]  No, I agree.
[02:36:43.614 --> 02:36:45.116]  That's the thinking at the White House.
[02:36:45.116 --> 02:36:46.477]  It's starting to change.
[02:36:46.477 --> 02:36:49.400]  Because they run arrogant headlines in the Atlantic that Trump's too weak.
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:51.002]  Facebook doesn't listen to him.
[02:36:51.002 --> 02:36:53.224]  Facebook knows it can just ignore and push Trump around.
[02:36:53.224 --> 02:36:53.764]  That's the headline.
[02:36:54.585 --> 02:36:57.208]  This is not just censorship on private platforms.
[02:36:57.208 --> 02:36:58.410]  It's racketeering.
[02:36:58.410 --> 02:36:59.632]  It's intimidation.
[02:36:59.632 --> 02:37:02.836]  It's letting CNN into people's phones to see what apps they have.
[02:37:02.836 --> 02:37:12.368]  It's a leftist terrorism with privatized NSA interfaces through these big tech companies set up by the NSA and In-Q-Tel.
[02:37:13.188 --> 02:37:16.650]  Our government set these all up and let private people run them.
[02:37:16.650 --> 02:37:18.811]  Trump hasn't been given all that info.
[02:37:18.811 --> 02:37:25.214]  It's why they're scared he's starting to win, because once he gets full understanding, he'll understand we've not really been a free market economy.
[02:37:25.214 --> 02:37:26.034]  We are quasi.
[02:37:26.034 --> 02:37:29.215]  We're a controlled market free market economy.
[02:37:29.215 --> 02:37:32.437]  And our government and our people set all that up through DARPA.
[02:37:33.652 --> 02:37:38.957]  And when they become destructive of the aims of the internet and why DARPA set it up, they can be relinquished.
[02:37:38.957 --> 02:37:41.940]  So I hear you and I appreciate your call, but it's bigger than censorship.
[02:37:41.940 --> 02:37:45.143]  It's organized election meddling and rocketeering.
[02:37:45.143 --> 02:37:47.085]  And I'm asking, what do we do?
[02:37:47.085 --> 02:37:49.667]  Trump must make it the central issue.
[02:37:49.667 --> 02:37:55.693]  Or he's going to lose because they're going to engage in fraud and he won't have a grassroots to communicate when they steal it.
[02:38:00.191 --> 02:38:01.452]  Up next, Dave in Nevada.
[02:38:01.452 --> 02:38:02.732]  Dave, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:38:02.732 --> 02:38:03.813]  Go ahead.
[02:38:03.813 --> 02:38:05.094]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:38:05.094 --> 02:38:06.134]  Good, buddy.
[02:38:06.134 --> 02:38:13.318]  Hey, I just wanted to talk to you about maybe something he should do is call the bluff.
[02:38:13.318 --> 02:38:15.579]  Let's just let him put his tax returns out.
[02:38:15.579 --> 02:38:23.603]  If all these states want to let him be off the ballot because he won't return or put his tax returns out,
[02:38:24.249 --> 02:38:28.491]  Put them out there, and then call for everybody else, because fair game is fair game.
[02:38:28.491 --> 02:38:31.052]  Oh, that Democrat bill to do that's not going to go anywhere.
[02:38:31.052 --> 02:38:33.072]  People should be able to keep their tax returns private.
[02:38:33.072 --> 02:38:35.233]  They want to harass everybody he's ever done business with.
[02:38:35.233 --> 02:38:37.794]  He has complex tax returns because he owned real estate.
[02:38:37.794 --> 02:38:41.655]  Each one has to be to the jurisdiction, and it's just total harassment.
[02:38:41.655 --> 02:38:46.017]  What about Hillary and her foundation and $4 billion from foreign governments?
[02:38:46.017 --> 02:38:50.018]  How about you indict her ass, then let's talk about his tax returns from 20 years ago, Dave.
[02:38:50.018 --> 02:38:50.939]  Appreciate the call.
[02:38:51.883 --> 02:38:52.483]  We're moving faster.
[02:38:52.483 --> 02:38:53.343]  I'm sure everybody's calling in.
[02:38:53.343 --> 02:38:54.404]  Jennifer in Michigan.
[02:38:54.404 --> 02:38:54.944]  You're on the air.
[02:38:54.944 --> 02:38:56.524]  Go ahead.
[02:38:56.524 --> 02:38:57.765]  Hello, Alex.
[02:38:57.765 --> 02:38:58.105]  Good.
[02:38:58.105 --> 02:38:58.385]  Welcome.
[02:38:58.385 --> 02:38:59.645]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:38:59.645 --> 02:39:01.106]  Thank you.
[02:39:01.106 --> 02:39:03.147]  We are under spiritual attack.
[02:39:03.147 --> 02:39:09.048]  I believe that it has to be coming from the demon side, and it's a cult.
[02:39:09.048 --> 02:39:10.709]  I'm not joining their cult.
[02:39:10.709 --> 02:39:12.670]  I'm standing up with you, Alex.
[02:39:12.670 --> 02:39:14.990]  I think that what you're doing is spot on.
[02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:16.311]  You are telling the truth.
[02:39:16.311 --> 02:39:20.372]  I can't even imagine the attack that you must be under, but I believe that
[02:39:21.246 --> 02:39:25.891]  President Trump should attack with the law.
[02:39:25.891 --> 02:39:40.247]  We, as a country, agreed and we have a law as a spiritual being, as a people, and our third dimension, as you say, we must abide by certain laws and they are usurping the power in many ways, as you know.
[02:39:41.247 --> 02:39:54.971]  I've lived close to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and I'm going to go to as many democratic, all of these conventions I'm going to go, and I'm going to blast them with the Infowars.
[02:39:54.971 --> 02:39:56.631]  By the way, let me just say this over the years.
[02:39:56.631 --> 02:39:57.871]  I love all the states.
[02:39:57.871 --> 02:40:01.532]  We've always had disproportionate calls from Michigan for your population.
[02:40:01.532 --> 02:40:04.913]  Michigan's the second state we get calls from.
[02:40:04.913 --> 02:40:07.634]  Texas is the number one, but it's the second most populous, if that makes sense.
[02:40:08.354 --> 02:40:11.715]  Michigan is just full of good people outside of Detroit.
[02:40:11.715 --> 02:40:16.056]  Detroit's got some good people too, it's just look what the Democrats ruined that amazing city.
[02:40:16.056 --> 02:40:18.317]  And just God bless you, I hear what you're saying.
[02:40:18.317 --> 02:40:24.199]  It's all happening, and they're racketeering, they're organized censoring, that's illegal.
[02:40:24.199 --> 02:40:32.021]  And I've got an article here where they're gonna have a $5 billion fine, and then Facebook's allowed to spy forever illegally when they made hundreds of billions off Americans.
[02:40:32.021 --> 02:40:34.261]  And Republicans are saying, making a $20 billion fine.
[02:40:34.261 --> 02:40:35.742]  Who cares about the damn fine?
[02:40:36.602 --> 02:40:42.123]  Facebook is engaged, like they bragged three years ago, working for the Democratic Party and other governments.
[02:40:42.123 --> 02:40:43.584]  They're out of control.
[02:40:43.584 --> 02:40:45.284]  And they lie to Congress about it.
[02:40:45.284 --> 02:40:48.505]  There's a thousand ways to break their back.
[02:40:48.505 --> 02:40:50.165]  And it's time to happen.
[02:40:50.165 --> 02:40:51.426]  Well, thank you very much.
[02:40:51.426 --> 02:40:55.767]  Let's go to another caller here, going in the order people have called in.
[02:40:55.767 --> 02:40:57.467]  Let's go ahead and take Keith in Michigan.
[02:40:57.467 --> 02:40:59.107]  So what I mean, I got all these Michigan calls.
[02:40:59.107 --> 02:41:00.528]  Keith, you're on the air for Michigan.
[02:41:00.528 --> 02:41:00.888]  Thank you, sir.
[02:41:01.940 --> 02:41:04.102]  Alex Jones, it's great to talk to you.
[02:41:04.102 --> 02:41:05.424]  I finally got through.
[02:41:05.424 --> 02:41:07.866]  Why do I get so many calls from Michigan?
[02:41:07.866 --> 02:41:12.190]  Well, Michigan kicks butt with a lot of blue-collar people here, you know?
[02:41:12.190 --> 02:41:15.373]  Well, you just meet a lot of red-blooded folks like Ted Nugent.
[02:41:15.373 --> 02:41:16.094]  Oh, yeah.
[02:41:16.094 --> 02:41:16.414]  Yep.
[02:41:16.414 --> 02:41:17.615]  I've been down to Texas, too.
[02:41:17.615 --> 02:41:18.516]  It's awesome down there.
[02:41:18.516 --> 02:41:19.157]  I love Austin.
[02:41:19.835 --> 02:41:21.776]  I worked in all around Texas.
[02:41:21.776 --> 02:41:24.017]  But anyways, I want to do a plug real quick.
[02:41:24.017 --> 02:41:26.079]  I bought the Electra Pure Pro water filter.
[02:41:26.079 --> 02:41:30.861]  We've got that PFAS problem up here from the Wurtsmith Air Force Base.
[02:41:30.861 --> 02:41:31.782]  PFAS.
[02:41:31.782 --> 02:41:32.462]  It's a big deal.
[02:41:32.462 --> 02:41:34.083]  They're fighting it all over the country now.
[02:41:34.083 --> 02:41:37.365]  Oh yeah, there's a lot of toxic stuff around military bases.
[02:41:37.365 --> 02:41:39.807]  Yeah, and I use you guys' products every day.
[02:41:39.807 --> 02:41:45.290]  I use the Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Survival Shield, Supermil Vitality, Winter Sun every day.
[02:41:45.290 --> 02:41:46.310]  I've got the Alpha Power.
[02:41:46.310 --> 02:41:47.171]  I haven't tried it yet.
[02:41:47.171 --> 02:41:48.131]  I can't wait to try it.
[02:41:48.131 --> 02:41:48.972]  The Real Red Pill.
[02:41:49.654 --> 02:41:55.797]  I just ordered one of your hats, and I just gotta say, I was a little reluctant to order a hat online.
[02:41:55.797 --> 02:41:58.918]  I thought it would be all beat up, but no, it's got perfect form.
[02:41:58.918 --> 02:42:00.339]  It's the best looking hat I've ordered.
[02:42:01.980 --> 02:42:09.363]  Anyways, yeah, everybody needs to come out of the closet and start wearing your apparel and let it be known that you're in for warriors out there.
[02:42:09.363 --> 02:42:17.026]  Well, I'll be honest, used to our designs were pretty good, but I would go with, you know, not super cheap, but mid-level hats and shirts because it was inexpensive for us.
[02:42:17.026 --> 02:42:18.587]  We'd sell it to you inexpensive.
[02:42:18.587 --> 02:42:21.508]  Now, I get like hats that are $12 and sell them for $20.
[02:42:22.268 --> 02:42:26.669]  I get shirts that are $14 and sell them for $20 just because it's a good way to get the word out.
[02:42:26.669 --> 02:42:31.870]  So most of our apparel now is in the 90% premium range.
[02:42:31.870 --> 02:42:35.330]  Like at a mall or something, it'd cost $50 for these t-shirts.
[02:42:35.330 --> 02:42:37.391]  Because the t-shirts are costing them like $15.
[02:42:37.391 --> 02:42:38.231]  So thank you so much.
[02:42:38.231 --> 02:42:40.551]  Did you want to add something about tech censorship?
[02:42:40.551 --> 02:42:41.791]  We'll come back to Keith.
[02:42:41.791 --> 02:42:43.752]  On the other side, then we'll go to everybody else.
[02:42:43.752 --> 02:42:46.512]  Got a lot of crazy important points coming in about censorship.
[02:42:46.512 --> 02:42:49.093]  It's this big tech censorship in Texas.
[02:42:49.093 --> 02:42:50.673]  Got a bunch of calls coming up.
[02:42:50.673 --> 02:42:51.113]  Stay with us.
[02:42:55.393 --> 02:42:59.295]  BrainForce Plus is a top-tier nootropic.

[02:44:00.413 --> 02:44:08.976]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:44:08.976 --> 02:44:11.957]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:44:11.957 --> 02:44:13.697]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:44:13.697 --> 02:44:19.979]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.

[02:45:27.752 --> 02:45:29.414]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[02:45:29.414 --> 02:45:32.278]  And we decided, I like Secret 12 Plus.
[02:45:32.278 --> 02:45:35.322]  But they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[02:45:35.322 --> 02:45:36.082]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[02:45:36.082 --> 02:45:36.863]  Well, you know what?
[02:45:36.863 --> 02:45:38.125]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[02:45:38.125 --> 02:45:40.128]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[02:45:40.128 --> 02:45:41.089]  We decided to change the name.
[02:45:41.089 --> 02:45:42.311]  So when you peel off the label...
[02:45:43.508 --> 02:45:47.210]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[02:45:47.210 --> 02:45:50.011]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.
[02:45:50.011 --> 02:45:51.912]  Better than Secret 12 ever was.

[02:45:56.294 --> 02:45:59.356]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[02:45:59.356 --> 02:46:02.297]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:46:02.297 --> 02:46:05.259]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:46:10.854 --> 02:46:19.998]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[02:46:59.769 --> 02:47:02.472]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.670 --> 02:47:18.595]  Uprising by Muse.
[02:47:18.595 --> 02:47:21.001]  Matthew Bellamy's been on the show probably 10 years ago.
[02:47:21.001 --> 02:47:23.527]  He said the song is inspired by this broadcast.
[02:47:25.253 --> 02:47:26.674]  Made it even more popular.
[02:47:26.674 --> 02:47:30.837]  In the end, the record company said, boy, you're not going anywhere if you don't shut up.
[02:47:30.837 --> 02:47:33.479]  He shut up, and now he's not as popular as he used to be.
[02:47:33.479 --> 02:47:35.961]  Listen to this song, and we're going back to your phone calls.
[02:47:35.961 --> 02:47:37.662]  And Paul Joseph Watts is coming up.
[02:47:37.662 --> 02:47:42.085]  And I say with huge news, the next shoe to drop on censorship just dropped.
[02:47:42.085 --> 02:47:43.666]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:47:43.666 --> 02:47:45.708]  Here's Muse, powered by Infowars.
[02:47:54.465 --> 02:47:56.386]  Keep the truth confined?
[02:47:56.386 --> 02:47:59.989]  What's happening right now?
[02:47:59.989 --> 02:48:01.570]  They will not force us.
[02:48:28.117 --> 02:48:32.079]  You will not control us.
[02:48:32.079 --> 02:48:44.423]  The will is strong for one that's only living.
[02:48:44.423 --> 02:48:46.784]  We will be.
[02:48:46.784 --> 02:48:53.907]  We wrote this off of our V for Victor campaign.
[02:48:58.171 --> 02:49:17.059]  Our real power, the gift I was given by God, when I started this 25 years ago, God told me, you're gonna go out and speak the truth, there'll be attacks, you'll be destroyed in the end, but you will energize the next group of leaders to defeat the globalists.
[02:49:17.059 --> 02:49:17.419]  Crank it up.
[02:49:29.929 --> 02:49:32.190]  That's the real power of InfoWars, it's inspiration.
[02:49:32.190 --> 02:49:32.610]  We will be.
[02:49:32.610 --> 02:49:32.750]  The.
[02:49:32.750 --> 02:49:32.910]  Force.
[02:50:04.301 --> 02:50:06.683]  And there's all these idiots.
[02:50:06.683 --> 02:50:08.044]  Every symbol you use.
[02:50:08.044 --> 02:50:09.565]  They're like, oh, that's a culture.
[02:50:09.565 --> 02:50:12.387]  I take back the V. I take back the sunrise.
[02:50:12.387 --> 02:50:13.888]  I take back the rainbow.
[02:50:13.888 --> 02:50:15.229]  I take back the star.
[02:50:15.229 --> 02:50:16.570]  I take back the cross.
[02:50:16.570 --> 02:50:17.531]  Bull!
[02:50:17.531 --> 02:50:19.933]  It's your intent that matters.
[02:50:19.933 --> 02:50:25.817]  When Winston Churchill flashed the V, it was for victory.
[02:50:25.817 --> 02:50:28.099]  Alright, Paul Joseph Watson's coming up.
[02:50:30.458 --> 02:50:32.441]  You knew it was coming, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:32.441 --> 02:50:36.346]  You know, I was in an airport flying back from doing Joe Rogan's podcast in L.A.
[02:50:36.346 --> 02:50:42.394]  And it was early morning, I was getting some breakfast, waiting for the flight, and I heard that song come on.
[02:50:42.394 --> 02:50:43.716]  I'm like, man, what's that band?
[02:50:43.716 --> 02:50:44.137]  Who is that?
[02:50:45.128 --> 02:50:46.148]  That's from like 10 years ago.
[02:50:46.148 --> 02:50:47.029]  I'm like, oh, Matthew Bellamy.
[02:50:47.029 --> 02:50:48.129]  I talked to him on a bunch of the phone.
[02:50:48.129 --> 02:50:49.510]  He came on the show a few times.
[02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:50.930]  He listened to the show every day.
[02:50:50.930 --> 02:50:53.471]  He said, you inspire me to write this whole album, these songs.
[02:50:53.471 --> 02:50:55.112]  You know, Billy Corgan still is a fan.
[02:50:55.112 --> 02:50:56.493]  I inspired like four or five of his albums.
[02:50:56.493 --> 02:50:57.553]  He's a great guy.
[02:50:57.553 --> 02:51:07.957]  And I'm not bragging about that, but I'm saying it's continually going back and seeing how we, that's all of us, you have been the epicenter of the change.
[02:51:07.957 --> 02:51:09.498]  I'm a train wreck.
[02:51:09.498 --> 02:51:10.458]  Sometimes I'm unlistenable.
[02:51:10.458 --> 02:51:11.179]  It doesn't matter.
[02:51:11.179 --> 02:51:14.200]  We have been anointed by God for this mission.
[02:51:15.402 --> 02:51:23.750]  And I knew it, 30 years ago I had to get on air, 25 years ago I got on air, and I knew the mission was, I'm not going to be the leader.
[02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:25.312]  I don't want to be the leader.
[02:51:25.312 --> 02:51:27.794]  I'm preparing the way for the leaders.
[02:51:27.794 --> 02:51:31.978]  God was so clear, you will prepare the way for the leaders.
[02:51:31.978 --> 02:51:39.626]  You will lay the ground, you will take on the enemy, you will awaken the people, you will be the Paul Revere, and you will get other Paul Reveres to take action.
[02:51:40.376 --> 02:51:48.980]  And I just, and God literally told me, you execute this operation, if you're willing to get destroyed in the end, you will carry the shout and we will win.
[02:51:48.980 --> 02:51:52.262]  And it's happened.
[02:51:52.262 --> 02:51:54.243]  It is a William Barrett Travis type mission.
[02:51:54.243 --> 02:51:54.863]  That's a good point.
[02:51:54.863 --> 02:51:56.144]  I'm not bragging about this, folks.
[02:51:56.144 --> 02:52:01.647]  The enemy knows the office that we're all in, the office you're in as Americans, to the whole world.
[02:52:01.647 --> 02:52:04.608]  A message of freedom, a message the enemy wants to snuff out.
[02:52:04.608 --> 02:52:05.809]  This is powerful.
[02:52:07.677 --> 02:52:11.379]  And everything you do, like a rock and a pond, changes the world.
[02:52:11.379 --> 02:52:16.862]  You think Big Tech wants to silence you to make you feel weak?
[02:52:16.862 --> 02:52:18.442]  You're not weak because they've silenced you.
[02:52:18.442 --> 02:52:19.623]  You're powerful!
[02:52:19.623 --> 02:52:20.944]  That's why they've silenced you.
[02:52:20.944 --> 02:52:23.145]  Because you love God and justice!
[02:52:23.145 --> 02:52:24.586]  Alright Keith, sorry I'm ranting.
[02:52:24.586 --> 02:52:29.188]  Finish up your point about Big Tech, how should the President counter, how should we counter?
[02:52:30.818 --> 02:52:37.825]  Yeah, I think he definitely needs to do something hopefully by the end of this year because, you know, the election is next year.
[02:52:37.825 --> 02:52:43.950]  I know he planned on waiting until after the election, but he better not because we need all, we need infowars.
[02:52:43.950 --> 02:52:45.712]  The media is saying he's ahead in the polls.
[02:52:45.712 --> 02:52:47.273]  He was always ahead in the polls.
[02:52:47.273 --> 02:52:50.176]  The fact that they're saying he's invincible is to make him go to sleep.
[02:52:50.176 --> 02:52:51.217]  He knows that.
[02:52:51.217 --> 02:52:52.919]  He said the only way the Democrats can win is cheating.
[02:52:52.919 --> 02:52:53.459]  He knows that.
[02:52:53.459 --> 02:52:54.861]  Well, they're going to cheat, Mr. President.
[02:52:55.521 --> 02:52:59.282]  So you better give it to him with both political barrels now.
[02:52:59.282 --> 02:53:00.342]  Strike now.
[02:53:00.342 --> 02:53:03.183]  No more waiting.
[02:53:03.183 --> 02:53:03.963]  Yep.
[02:53:03.963 --> 02:53:04.643]  Alright.
[02:53:04.643 --> 02:53:06.184]  Well, thanks for taking my call, everybody.
[02:53:06.184 --> 02:53:10.285]  Buy his product, keep him online, and take care, Alex.
[02:53:10.285 --> 02:53:14.726]  Just keep us on air long enough to complete the mission, and I know we'll be here a while longer.
[02:53:14.726 --> 02:53:16.186]  But, and I don't just say this.
[02:53:16.186 --> 02:53:20.147]  People have heard me say this for like 15 years.
[02:53:20.147 --> 02:53:22.968]  God told me you will be destroyed in the end.
[02:53:24.986 --> 02:53:26.348]  I mean, that means physically.
[02:53:26.348 --> 02:53:29.712]  I'm not trying to make this come true.
[02:53:29.712 --> 02:53:31.213]  I just have known this.
[02:53:31.213 --> 02:53:35.919]  God said, you're going to do all this, but you're going to have to go through a lot of pain, and it's going to get real bad.
[02:53:35.919 --> 02:53:38.542]  But in the end, you're going to salt the earth.
[02:53:38.542 --> 02:53:39.843]  And that means our whole audience.
[02:53:39.843 --> 02:53:40.885]  Just like you've gone through a lot.
[02:53:41.385 --> 02:53:42.066]  This is a mission.
[02:53:42.066 --> 02:53:43.246]  This is a good mission.
[02:53:43.246 --> 02:53:51.213]  And we take the power from the enemy when they bankrupt us or kill us or imprison us when we still do it for God and the unborn for what's right.
[02:53:51.213 --> 02:53:57.397]  We circumnavigate their fraud and their worldly system and say, we don't care about what you do to this body.
[02:53:57.397 --> 02:54:03.042]  It's the soul right here that matters forever.
[02:54:03.042 --> 02:54:04.343]  All right, let's go back to the calls here.
[02:54:04.343 --> 02:54:06.785]  This is epic stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:06.785 --> 02:54:07.885]  Epic times to be alive.
[02:54:07.885 --> 02:54:09.667]  Incredible times to be alive.
[02:54:09.667 --> 02:54:10.968]  Who's been holding longest now?
[02:54:12.006 --> 02:54:15.588]  Let's go to Bob in New York.
[02:54:15.588 --> 02:54:16.448]  Bob, thanks for holding.
[02:54:16.448 --> 02:54:17.929]  Go ahead.
[02:54:17.929 --> 02:54:19.310]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:19.310 --> 02:54:19.790]  Welcome, brother.
[02:54:19.790 --> 02:54:20.531]  God bless you, man.
[02:54:20.531 --> 02:54:22.552]  God bless you, your staff.
[02:54:22.552 --> 02:54:25.793]  And thank you so much for the resources that you commit to this whole thing.
[02:54:25.793 --> 02:54:29.075]  That's really something that people don't... It's your resources, brother.
[02:54:29.075 --> 02:54:31.156]  I'm just trying to be a good steward of them.
[02:54:31.156 --> 02:54:32.657]  Yeah, you know, I support you.
[02:54:32.657 --> 02:54:34.538]  I buy a lot of stuff, but I didn't want to talk about that.
[02:54:34.538 --> 02:54:37.220]  I mean, I wanted to talk to you about a couple of things.
[02:54:37.220 --> 02:54:39.561]  I mean, Duke, when you had David Duke on,
[02:54:40.379 --> 02:54:42.483]  I can't believe you gave him that much air time.
[02:54:42.483 --> 02:54:44.647]  He just kept digging a hole for himself.
[02:54:44.647 --> 02:54:49.276]  And then when you went on Piers Morgan, I was like, that's how we're supposed to go on television.
[02:54:49.276 --> 02:54:51.841]  You're supposed to take over the airways.
[02:54:51.841 --> 02:54:52.923]  And that's the importance of
[02:54:53.843 --> 02:54:55.405]  of freedom of speech.
[02:54:55.405 --> 02:54:59.508]  I mean, if they take away your voice, you can't do that.
[02:54:59.508 --> 02:55:07.735]  I went to Duke to have him on because they were asking to come on the same way I went to Farrakhan to try to like create racial unity.
[02:55:07.735 --> 02:55:12.700]  And I was like saying, really, shouldn't we just, you know, the average Jew is not to get to the average black person.
[02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:15.260]  And I was just like, you know, this is all programmed.
[02:55:15.260 --> 02:55:17.721]  He just, he was robotic and wouldn't listen to me.
[02:55:17.721 --> 02:55:20.042]  Farrakhan was like, absolutely, let's do it all.
[02:55:20.042 --> 02:55:23.702]  That's why they ignored the Farrakhan interview and promoted the Duke interview.
[02:55:23.702 --> 02:55:26.923]  And I'm not promoting Farrakhan because he's black and Duke's a white guy.
[02:55:26.923 --> 02:55:29.744]  Duke's a very well spoken, very smart guy.
[02:55:29.744 --> 02:55:33.045]  The point is, is that it was very synthetic.
[02:55:33.045 --> 02:55:35.645]  It was like I was talking to a robot.
[02:55:35.645 --> 02:55:36.525]  I know.
[02:55:36.525 --> 02:55:38.546]  And, uh, you know, now we're at the point though, if they,
[02:55:39.150 --> 02:55:47.675]  If they cut off Twitter or if Facebook goes down for a little while, I mean, they can really enact like Operation Gladio in a bad way.
[02:55:47.675 --> 02:55:54.539]  And, you know, I mean, you're talking about eight minutes of something being misconstrued or delayed, I mean, or a day or three hours.
[02:55:54.539 --> 02:55:56.680]  You know, they can really start a race war.
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:55:58.841]  Oh, that's their plan.
[02:55:58.841 --> 02:56:00.262]  And Farrakhan's worried about that.
[02:56:00.262 --> 02:56:02.163]  And they take things he says out of context.
[02:56:02.163 --> 02:56:03.344]  And I'm not defending everything he ever said.
[02:56:03.344 --> 02:56:04.244]  I'm defending everything I ever said.
[02:56:06.946 --> 02:56:15.052]  He had a very strong will, very loving, and you couldn't help but, probably the most charming person, because you're one of those people that have those presents.
[02:56:15.052 --> 02:56:21.958]  He's an old guy now, still had a very powerful presence.
[02:56:21.958 --> 02:56:25.401]  He was looking for me for leadership and how to stop a race war.
[02:56:26.081 --> 02:56:31.044]  I was just there listening to him, and at the end he was kind of frustrated because I didn't tell him what I thought he should do.
[02:56:31.044 --> 02:56:33.786]  But it's kind of hard to sit there with a guy like that and tell him what he should do.
[02:56:33.786 --> 02:56:37.208]  That's why I'm going to go meet with Farrakhan again and have a real meeting with him.
[02:56:37.208 --> 02:56:39.870]  And again, I'm not defending some things he said, some of it's out of context.
[02:56:39.870 --> 02:56:43.572]  The point is, he is not even a closeted Trump supporter.
[02:56:43.572 --> 02:56:44.613]  He told me point blank.
[02:56:44.613 --> 02:56:45.994]  And I said, is that for public consumption?
[02:56:45.994 --> 02:56:47.155]  He said, yeah.
[02:56:47.155 --> 02:56:50.317]  But he said, I'll support Trump in some of his aspects if he does the right thing.
[02:56:50.317 --> 02:56:52.258]  I know the enemy hates him.
[02:56:52.258 --> 02:56:55.000]  And he thought that I could get a message to Trump.
[02:56:55.919 --> 02:57:01.482]  And the times I talked to Trump never brought up Louis Farrakhan, but imagine if Louis Farrakhan came out and supported Trump.
[02:57:01.482 --> 02:57:09.286]  You know, they didn't just throw him in as a token other person, you know, leftist or whatever, to make it look like the band wasn't of conservatives.
[02:57:09.286 --> 02:57:13.228]  They know he's behind Kanye West going public.
[02:57:13.228 --> 02:57:14.629]  I let out something big there.
[02:57:14.629 --> 02:57:16.229]  That's who's behind it, Louis Farrakhan.
[02:57:16.229 --> 02:57:22.012]  They know Louis Farrakhan is changing with the times.
[02:57:22.012 --> 02:57:22.973]  Doesn't mean he's selling out.
[02:57:22.973 --> 02:57:24.674]  And I'm not even defending Louis Farrakhan.
[02:57:25.655 --> 02:57:36.949]  I'm saying the enemy with their AI computers and their you-know-what systems have sat there and portended Jones must be shut down.
[02:57:36.949 --> 02:57:38.571]  Farrakhan must be shut down.
[02:57:38.571 --> 02:57:40.133]  Watson must be shut down.
[02:57:40.133 --> 02:57:41.514]  All the wildcards.
[02:57:41.514 --> 02:57:42.435]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:57:42.435 --> 02:57:43.116]  I'll go back to more calls.
[02:57:45.242 --> 02:57:48.844]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:57:48.844 --> 02:57:50.605]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:57:50.605 --> 02:58:02.671]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.671 --> 02:58:11.396]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:58:11.856 --> 02:58:17.823]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:58:17.823 --> 02:58:22.908]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:58:22.908 --> 02:58:25.531]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:58:25.531 --> 02:58:27.233]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:27.233 --> 02:58:32.058]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[02:58:32.278 --> 02:58:37.222]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:58:37.222 --> 02:58:39.865]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:58:39.865 --> 02:58:44.589]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[02:58:46.471 --> 02:58:51.334]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:58:51.334 --> 02:59:00.260]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[02:59:00.260 --> 02:59:05.584]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[02:59:05.584 --> 02:59:15.811]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support
[02:59:15.811 --> 02:59:16.131]  I think so.
[02:59:49.296 --> 03:00:06.350]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.350 --> 03:00:09.292]  Alright, let's go through as many of your calls as we can.
[03:00:09.292 --> 03:00:12.354]  And then Paul Watson's coming up with huge news on the First Amendment.
[03:00:12.354 --> 03:00:13.095]  We knew it was coming.
[03:00:13.095 --> 03:00:14.876]  Wait until you hear this next segment.
[03:00:14.876 --> 03:00:16.738]  Really important information.
[03:00:16.738 --> 03:00:17.678]  I told you their main enemy.
[03:00:18.917 --> 03:00:20.577]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[03:00:20.577 --> 03:00:21.017]  Good, brother.
[03:00:42.867 --> 03:00:52.692]  Hey, I want to point out that sometimes the obvious is not obvious, and I think that if people step back and think about what I'm about to say, it'll make perfect sense.
[03:00:52.692 --> 03:01:03.517]  You know, say Albert Pike had come up with the New World Order of 225 years ago, so all this stuff had been pre-written and pre-planned out, and what dawned on me the other day is that
[03:01:04.164 --> 03:01:07.606]  Big Tech was created by the Deep State.
[03:01:07.606 --> 03:01:12.708]  They've always been 10 steps ahead of us on the invention of the computer and the internet.
[03:01:12.708 --> 03:01:14.529]  The internet was created by the U.S.
[03:01:14.529 --> 03:01:15.630]  government.
[03:01:15.630 --> 03:01:22.573]  And they knew that they were gonna need programs where people would just put their information out there for free, where they could trap people.
[03:01:22.573 --> 03:01:25.475]  Which sets the precedent that you have no privacy, yes.
[03:01:25.475 --> 03:01:27.636]  Well, they created these spacemen, I call it.
[03:01:27.636 --> 03:01:32.138]  Zuckerberg, you know, it's just not coincidental that he's related to Soros, they say.
[03:01:32.719 --> 03:01:44.546]  I think that Dorsey and the guy that created YouTube, I think they're all fictitional people that are out there in front of the public to make the public believe that these people created... Oh, you're totally right.
[03:01:44.546 --> 03:01:48.608]  DARPA did all this, but now it's been hijacked and given to China, and that's why the U.S.
[03:01:48.608 --> 03:01:50.549]  government must take back control of it.
[03:01:50.549 --> 03:01:53.551]  Or is Trump really going along with this, and is he sandbagging us?
[03:01:54.377 --> 03:01:57.880]  Well, and they use the fact that these companies are private companies.
[03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:01.303]  That's an excuse for them to not regulate these companies.
[03:02:01.303 --> 03:02:03.485]  That way they're not under foyer, exactly.
[03:02:03.485 --> 03:02:04.245]  That's right.
[03:02:04.245 --> 03:02:11.872]  So whenever people know the gig is up, they've all been fooled into thinking that all of these websites were created by... Oh, that hoax!
[03:02:11.872 --> 03:02:16.996]  It's private, so we can spy on you and let Oliver Darcy in your phone and ban you making phone calls.
[03:02:16.996 --> 03:02:18.657]  We can spy on you because we're private.
[03:02:18.657 --> 03:02:19.618]  No, it's all illegal.
[03:02:19.618 --> 03:02:21.400]  It's all a load of crap.
[03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:21.640]  Right.
[03:02:22.435 --> 03:02:23.035]  Good deal.
[03:02:23.035 --> 03:02:23.996]  Well that's all I wanted to say.
[03:02:23.996 --> 03:02:25.817]  I wanted to say a couple things about the products.
[03:02:25.817 --> 03:02:27.178]  I've tried them all.
[03:02:27.178 --> 03:02:31.360]  One recommendation is I'd add some more paste to the toothpaste.
[03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:38.145]  Maybe put some baking powder in there because I think it liquefies a little before you're done brushing your teeth.
[03:02:38.145 --> 03:02:42.247]  And another thing is I think your best product by far is the knockout.
[03:02:42.247 --> 03:02:46.890]  And I think if you were able to get this product on the counters of every convenience store
[03:02:47.700 --> 03:02:58.815]  Um, in the country that not only would this drive people to the website by, you know, finding the info, info wars or.com, you know, on the back, but that product is so powerful.
[03:02:58.815 --> 03:03:02.079]  I think that that product alone would fund the operation.
[03:03:02.079 --> 03:03:02.920]  It's just amazing.
[03:03:04.488 --> 03:03:05.348]  No, I agree with you.
[03:03:05.348 --> 03:03:06.269]  We really should all do that.
[03:03:06.269 --> 03:03:08.829]  If somebody's a distributor to gas stations around the country, give us a call.
[03:03:08.829 --> 03:03:09.250]  We'll do it.
[03:03:09.250 --> 03:03:10.170]  God bless you.
[03:03:10.170 --> 03:03:19.273]  Yeah, I told the developers of the Coital Silver Iodine Fortified and Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, I said, I don't want any fillers.
[03:03:19.273 --> 03:03:22.074]  Because they're like, well, half of toothpaste is fillers.
[03:03:22.074 --> 03:03:23.254]  Silicate and all these other things.
[03:03:23.254 --> 03:03:27.656]  So people get used to sand in their toothpaste.
[03:03:27.656 --> 03:03:30.557]  And we don't put but a little bit of that in there.
[03:03:30.557 --> 03:03:31.257]  So you're actually getting
[03:03:32.472 --> 03:03:33.933]  Nothing but what's actually in toothpaste.
[03:03:33.933 --> 03:03:37.575]  So, but it is very concentrated, very strong, doesn't take very much of it.
[03:03:37.575 --> 03:03:47.521]  But I've actually, via request, just last week said to my dad, who's a retired oral surgeon and dentist, I said, let's put out a standard toothpaste with no flora, but ionic little silver.
[03:03:47.521 --> 03:03:50.963]  That's the classic paste, you know, thick, people like that.
[03:03:50.963 --> 03:03:52.403]  I'm getting requests for that.
[03:03:52.403 --> 03:03:54.845]  And, but technically, I guess we won't call.
[03:03:56.866 --> 03:04:02.428]  I guess calcium or silicate or sand a filler.
[03:04:02.428 --> 03:04:04.369]  We don't sell you a tube of sand.
[03:04:04.369 --> 03:04:07.991]  Like the average toothpaste is half of it sand.
[03:04:07.991 --> 03:04:09.691]  So I hear ya, it's a great point.
[03:04:09.691 --> 03:04:10.452]  Okay, here's the deal.
[03:04:10.452 --> 03:04:11.552]  We got 20 phone lines.
[03:04:11.552 --> 03:04:14.053]  I think I got to like 20 calls.
[03:04:14.053 --> 03:04:18.415]  And I want to get to Wendy, I want to get to Sean, I want to get to Patrick, Ken, and Chris, but Paul Watts is taking over.
[03:04:18.415 --> 03:04:20.236]  So if you guys, we'll have open phones again tomorrow.
[03:04:20.236 --> 03:04:23.297]  They call, head of the line, thank you for holding, I really appreciate that.
[03:04:24.602 --> 03:04:27.143]  Paul Watson is coming up on the other side.
[03:04:27.143 --> 03:04:32.784]  I'm going to introduce him and read some of the new articles that are on InfoWars.com and NewsWorks.com.
[03:04:32.784 --> 03:04:34.684]  I challenged Paul nine months ago.
[03:04:34.684 --> 03:04:35.324]  We were getting banned.
[03:04:35.324 --> 03:04:37.785]  I said, you need to start your own stuff.
[03:04:37.785 --> 03:04:41.566]  You need to, you need to not be, so he's totally loyal.
[03:04:41.566 --> 03:04:44.586]  He didn't leave to do his own thing because he wanted to.
[03:04:44.586 --> 03:04:46.827]  I mean, I thought that was a good idea.
[03:04:46.827 --> 03:04:47.327]  He did too.
[03:04:47.327 --> 03:04:48.227]  He still does work for us.
[03:04:48.227 --> 03:04:49.287]  He still works for us.
[03:04:49.287 --> 03:04:51.568]  He's doing his own thing at Summit.News.
[03:04:51.568 --> 03:04:52.608]  We're very excited about that.
[03:04:54.448 --> 03:05:07.856]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most oppressed.
[03:05:07.856 --> 03:05:18.903]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[03:05:20.214 --> 03:05:22.141]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:05:22.141 --> 03:05:24.810]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:05:26.186 --> 03:05:30.508]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:05:30.508 --> 03:05:34.770]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[03:05:34.770 --> 03:05:37.051]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:05:37.051 --> 03:05:39.372]  This country is in a war!
[03:05:39.372 --> 03:05:50.057]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:05:50.057 --> 03:05:53.639]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[03:05:56.283 --> 03:05:56.864]  We've got it.
[03:05:56.864 --> 03:06:03.389]  This transmission is coming to you.
[03:06:03.389 --> 03:06:07.773]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:07.773 --> 03:06:13.418]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:16.039 --> 03:06:19.221]  The last few hours we've learned a lot.
[03:06:19.221 --> 03:06:20.742]  The last few minutes we've learned even more.
[03:06:20.742 --> 03:06:24.843]  I'm going to have Paul Watson take over right now from Summit.News.
[03:06:24.843 --> 03:06:29.266]  He also does work for Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:06:29.266 --> 03:06:31.707]  But the mothership's got big gaping blast holes in it.
[03:06:31.707 --> 03:06:34.068]  It's important for folks to go out and
[03:06:35.865 --> 03:06:38.066]  Procreate and the Information War.
[03:06:38.066 --> 03:06:38.646]  Huge!
[03:06:38.646 --> 03:06:43.367]  Facebook hired former Hillary press director to inform media of Alex Jones' ban.
[03:06:43.367 --> 03:06:45.388]  That's bigleapolitics.com.
[03:06:45.388 --> 03:06:47.028]  Tom Papert, very important.
[03:06:47.028 --> 03:06:49.309]  Paul Watson's latest article on infowars.com.
[03:06:49.309 --> 03:06:56.750]  You want to share it from newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, or summit.news because those don't get censored by the filters as much.
[03:06:56.750 --> 03:06:58.271]  Alex Jones is a verboten word.
[03:06:59.071 --> 03:07:02.292]  According to Lord Zuckerberg and others, they all coordinate.
[03:07:02.292 --> 03:07:08.034]  InfoWars is verboten, so promote NewsWars.com, Shumit.News, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:07:08.034 --> 03:07:10.495]  Still gets all the same info out.
[03:07:10.495 --> 03:07:12.956]  Word of mouth, InfoWars is the battle cry.
[03:07:12.956 --> 03:07:13.416]  First Amendment.
[03:07:14.276 --> 03:07:16.778]  Instagram to fact-check memes.
[03:07:16.778 --> 03:07:19.779]  And Paul, I know you got a lot of stuff to cover, but I want you to get this first.
[03:07:19.779 --> 03:07:22.000]  Instagram to fact-check and remove memes.
[03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:26.403]  So, remember, they've got AI already at Facebook that owns Instagram.
[03:07:26.403 --> 03:07:30.565]  In live time, as soon as you say, I like Alex Jones, God bless Alex Jones, it's banned.
[03:07:30.565 --> 03:07:31.826]  Just like they said they'd do.
[03:07:31.826 --> 03:07:34.447]  Or an InfoWars link, then they threaten to ban you.
[03:07:34.447 --> 03:07:35.848]  And they ban the link.
[03:07:35.848 --> 03:07:38.570]  But people say, Jones, Alex.
[03:07:40.137 --> 03:07:43.160]  Or Info-Wars, you know, for Botan.
[03:07:43.160 --> 03:07:44.521]  They can still get it through.
[03:07:44.521 --> 03:07:48.946]  So they have 20,000 fact-checkers hired by Obama and Hillary from the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:07:48.946 --> 03:07:51.128]  This is mainline news, I'm not joking.
[03:07:51.128 --> 03:07:53.150]  In your computer, in your profile, watching you.
[03:07:53.150 --> 03:07:54.171]  It's totally criminal.
[03:07:54.171 --> 03:07:56.373]  But why not you put up with a Lex in your house listening to you?
[03:07:56.373 --> 03:07:57.534]  I mean, it's all over the news.
[03:07:57.534 --> 03:07:59.116]  They just do what they want.
[03:07:59.116 --> 03:08:00.897]  They rule you.
[03:08:00.897 --> 03:08:02.399]  And you put up with it, so they're doing it.
[03:08:04.568 --> 03:08:06.254]  AI can't understand memes.
[03:08:06.254 --> 03:08:08.039]  Well, you can't fact-check a meme.
[03:08:08.039 --> 03:08:09.042]  It's a joke.
[03:08:09.042 --> 03:08:11.490]  Let's play the penguin thing again and let Paul take over.
[03:08:12.418 --> 03:08:14.219]  A meme is a joke.
[03:08:14.219 --> 03:08:20.543]  I'm in the office in a meeting yesterday with some of the writers and crew, and I said, the globalists just want power to rape us.
[03:08:20.543 --> 03:08:22.345]  They just want to dominate us for no reason.
[03:08:22.345 --> 03:08:23.025]  They're mentally ill.
[03:08:23.025 --> 03:08:24.546]  They don't want to build a civilization.
[03:08:24.546 --> 03:08:29.389]  And Kent Daniels said, like lion seals rape penguins.
[03:08:29.389 --> 03:08:30.370]  And I said, is that a joke?
[03:08:30.370 --> 03:08:32.111]  He said, no, look it up.
[03:08:32.111 --> 03:08:34.392]  I said, God, we ought to put Zuckerberg's head on that and have it me.
[03:08:35.561 --> 03:08:37.722]  And, well, the rest is right there.
[03:08:37.722 --> 03:08:40.643]  Obviously, Zuckerberg's not a SEAL.
[03:08:40.643 --> 03:08:42.364]  He's obviously not physically raping me.
[03:08:42.364 --> 03:08:43.984]  I'm not a king penguin.
[03:08:43.984 --> 03:08:45.265]  It's a joke.
[03:08:45.265 --> 03:08:58.210]  Remember Trump said, three months ago, the first time he had football players at the White House, he said, because there was a government shutdown, he said, I have bought mile highs of hamburgers and cheeseburgers.
[03:08:58.210 --> 03:09:02.912]  Washington Post said there was only a thousand hamburgers or whatever, so it only went up a few hundred feet.
[03:09:02.912 --> 03:09:03.672]  It wasn't a mile high.
[03:09:04.514 --> 03:09:08.756]  It was hyperbole!
[03:09:08.756 --> 03:09:15.758]  Again, obviously they can fact check a meme and then say it's wrong.
[03:09:15.758 --> 03:09:21.140]  This is them trying to put their Snopes garbage onto jokes.
[03:09:21.140 --> 03:09:24.982]  But even when something is 100% real and confirmed, Snopes says it isn't happening.
[03:09:26.038 --> 03:09:30.701]  So we're going to play this piece and let Paul take over here as we go to break in a few minutes.
[03:09:30.701 --> 03:09:33.984]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, our new product, Zen.
[03:09:33.984 --> 03:09:38.927]  Twice as strong, same high-quality methylcobalamin, highest quality you can get.
[03:09:38.927 --> 03:09:42.610]  Ultra 12, twice as strong for the same price, 50% off right now.
[03:09:42.610 --> 03:09:44.872]  One of our top products, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:09:44.872 --> 03:09:47.093]  Go read the five-star reviews of Secret 12.
[03:09:47.093 --> 03:09:49.715]  Ultra 12 is the same thing, just twice as strong.
[03:09:49.715 --> 03:09:53.038]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, thumb it in
[03:09:53.798 --> 03:09:56.200]  Soros and Hillary's face, spread the links.
[03:09:56.200 --> 03:09:59.383]  But let's go to this satire piece.
[03:09:59.383 --> 03:10:01.244]  Satire piece.
[03:10:01.244 --> 03:10:04.167]  Zuckerberg's not a 3,000 pound seal.
[03:10:04.167 --> 03:10:05.828]  I'm not a King Penguin.
[03:10:05.828 --> 03:10:07.330]  This is an allegory.
[03:10:07.330 --> 03:10:08.451]  Here it is.
[03:10:08.451 --> 03:10:17.899]  And this shocking footage is even more painful when you see the albatrosses of CNN and other MSN outlets cheering on the rape.
[03:10:18.579 --> 03:10:29.684]  In fact, it's been found that these systems actually direct the monstrous seal, Zuckerberg, against the free speech enemies and anyone that tries to not submit.
[03:10:29.684 --> 03:10:41.910]  But most sad of all is other penguins in the independent media simply looking up at the sky and ignoring the vicious rape of their own freedoms and birthright taking place right in front of them.
[03:10:41.910 --> 03:10:43.111]  This is pure gold.
[03:10:43.951 --> 03:10:46.652]  It really is like bunker siege mentality at the moment, Alex.
[03:11:06.337 --> 03:11:17.366]  The point about that is you can have a Stephen Colbert or a Bill Maher that can have his serious news commentary and that's treated seriously and then the rest of the time he can joke and that's treated as satire.
[03:11:17.366 --> 03:11:28.296]  If you put out a joke or a meme or a piece of satire they treat that as serious and then when you have your serious separate opinion on the side of that they treat that as a joke.
[03:11:28.296 --> 03:11:29.857]  Anyone on the right can't joke.
[03:11:30.413 --> 03:11:35.234]  They make these accusations all day long about how the right is terrible at comedy.
[03:11:35.234 --> 03:11:40.116]  And when anyone on the right attempts to do comedy, they take that as serious.
[03:11:40.116 --> 03:11:52.280]  Like, Media Matters will probably be publishing an article within the hour saying that you seriously claimed that you got raped by Mark Zuckerberg after he transmogrified into a sea lion.
[03:11:52.280 --> 03:11:55.080]  Because we can't have jokes, we can't have our memes.
[03:11:55.080 --> 03:11:59.922]  And that's the point of this article, which is up on infowars.com and summit.news.
[03:12:00.615 --> 03:12:15.568]  Which is Instagram has now announced that it's going to fact-check memes, and by that they mean they're going to classify something as erroneous, misleading, and they're going to prevent it from appearing in people's feeds, people who are randomly on Facebook.
[03:12:15.568 --> 03:12:21.674]  Instagram has banned this meme, Zuckerberg is not a 3,000 pound seal raping a penguin.
[03:12:21.674 --> 03:12:23.455]  Zuckerberg did not rape a penguin.
[03:12:23.455 --> 03:12:23.796]  Yeah.
[03:12:25.231 --> 03:12:26.992]  No, they do it in Snopes.
[03:12:26.992 --> 03:12:30.975]  There was a, what was it, the Babylon Bee came out, which is a satire website.
[03:12:30.975 --> 03:12:39.662]  It says in its description, this is a satire website, and Snopes takes one of their articles and fact-checks it, and says this is fake news.
[03:12:39.662 --> 03:12:41.744]  Yeah, it's from a satire website.
[03:12:41.744 --> 03:12:44.586]  You're gonna start fact-checking theonion.com?
[03:12:44.586 --> 03:12:50.170]  This is the level, and they've hired 52 global fact-checking partners.
[03:12:50.771 --> 03:12:54.452]  To censor false photos and memes on the platform.
[03:12:54.452 --> 03:13:08.416]  And of course when you look into it, and this was in the Poynter Institute, which recently, just a few days ago, had to shut down its own database highlighting unreliable news sites, because that database was unreliable.
[03:13:08.416 --> 03:13:13.918]  So they claim that they've got all the credibility and they're going to be the judge, jury and executioner of your credibility.
[03:13:14.631 --> 03:13:23.516]  Listen, I had NewsGuard a couple of days ago saying, oh, we want to ask you a list of questions about how credible your news site is, talking about summit.news.
[03:13:23.516 --> 03:13:30.221]  Then they install the extension on the browser, and they're trying to get Windows to do it on the purchase of every new PC.
[03:13:30.221 --> 03:13:33.623]  They want you to bow to them like they're the judge and jury, they're the master.
[03:13:33.623 --> 03:13:39.286]  Oh, Neocons, the polls for WDs in Iraq that run NewsGuard, it's going to be on our browser controlling us.
[03:13:39.286 --> 03:13:42.668]  Yes, master, let me grovel to you and prove I'm good.
[03:13:44.952 --> 03:13:52.616]  Like, who would want another annoying browser extension anyway that told them what they needed to think about certain websites and certain news sources?
[03:13:52.616 --> 03:13:55.398]  Let people make their own damn mind up, for God's sake.
[03:13:55.398 --> 03:13:57.679]  So this is all going to backfire, Paul.
[03:13:57.679 --> 03:14:01.802]  Tell us what else is coming up when you take over in the next segment.
[03:14:01.802 --> 03:14:04.403]  Well, Vice Media was basically going bankrupt.
[03:14:04.403 --> 03:14:11.147]  In fact, they've had to amalgamate a bunch of their different sectors under one umbrella because they were going bankrupt, like BuzzFeed and CNN.
[03:14:11.997 --> 03:14:19.347]  So now it turns out that Vice Media has raised 250 million dollars in debt from investors including George Soros!
[03:14:20.245 --> 03:14:21.866]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:14:21.866 --> 03:14:26.908]  We don't get fat checks from George Soros to rescue us, do we Alex, when we have monetary problems?
[03:14:26.908 --> 03:14:36.713]  But Vice Media, despite the fact that it's a completely failing brand, yet again gets another safety net from George Soros, who you can't even name now.
[03:14:36.713 --> 03:14:38.214]  You can't even name George Soros.
[03:14:38.214 --> 03:14:39.575]  It means you're anti-Semitic.
[03:14:39.575 --> 03:14:45.918]  So we've even acknowledged that George Soros contributes money and finances political movements across the world.
[03:14:45.918 --> 03:14:47.279]  That's anti-Semitic.
[03:14:47.279 --> 03:14:48.479]  You can't say it.
[03:14:48.479 --> 03:14:49.720]  So we've got all these rumours
[03:14:50.635 --> 03:14:53.925]  This is, of course, after BuzzFeed had to lay off a bunch of people.
[03:14:53.925 --> 03:14:56.853]  Now rumours that CNN is about to lay off 300 people...
[03:14:59.511 --> 03:15:10.757]  Brian Stelter's out denying it, but the indications are not very good to CNN, especially given the fact that they've lost 26% of their audience in the last year alone.
[03:15:10.757 --> 03:15:17.860]  Isn't that a coincidence, given that they're now on the front lines of de-platforming, censoring and banning their competition?
[03:15:17.860 --> 03:15:28.246]  So we've got all these digital media outlets basically going bust, but as they collapse, they're trying to drag everyone else down with them by getting them banned on social media.
[03:15:28.886 --> 03:15:30.627]  So we've got that.
[03:15:30.627 --> 03:15:33.069]  Of course, we've got the big news about Instagram.
[03:15:33.069 --> 03:15:37.511]  We've got, uh, CNN headline asks, how black will the royal baby be?
[03:15:37.511 --> 03:15:39.553]  An absolute bizarre question.
[03:15:39.553 --> 03:15:44.316]  They're saying that people who take this as a sign that race relations are improving are wrong.
[03:15:44.316 --> 03:15:45.196]  It's not a good sign.
[03:15:45.196 --> 03:15:49.459]  We need to be constantly at each other's throats, constantly with that divisive rhetoric.
[03:15:49.459 --> 03:15:52.361]  We'll get into that and more on the next side of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:52.361 --> 03:15:53.461]  InfoWars.com.
[03:15:53.461 --> 03:15:54.442]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.662 --> 03:15:58.583]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.583 --> 03:16:00.124]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:00.124 --> 03:16:03.085]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:03.085 --> 03:16:08.647]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.647 --> 03:16:09.847]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.847 --> 03:16:12.768]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.768 --> 03:16:14.989]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[03:16:22.992 --> 03:16:29.337]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.337 --> 03:16:32.380]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.380 --> 03:16:38.324]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.324 --> 03:16:42.107]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.107 --> 03:16:43.368]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.368 --> 03:16:44.710]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.710 --> 03:16:50.915]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.915 --> 03:16:52.356]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:52.955 --> 03:16:55.157]  Okay, so a watch is good, and some jewelry.
[03:16:55.157 --> 03:16:56.459]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[03:16:56.459 --> 03:16:57.460]  Hey, whatcha doin'?

[03:19:57.295 --> 03:19:59.896]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.866 --> 03:20:24.355]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:24.355 --> 03:20:28.958]  We are back live, and one of the solutions to all this
[03:20:30.035 --> 03:20:38.361]  flagrant social media censorship right now, well for the moment at least, is a app called Telegram.
[03:20:38.361 --> 03:20:47.387]  Now I signed up for this app last night, so in less than 24 hours of signing up for this app, I've got over 6,000 followers.
[03:20:47.387 --> 03:20:56.614]  The link, and we're going to get a link up for Alex as well as soon as possible, I think there's already an InfoWars group on there, but the link for me on Telegram is
[03:20:57.398 --> 03:21:10.742]  t.me slash pjwnews t.me slash pjwnews So you can go there, you can download the desktop application and you can download the app on your phone.
[03:21:10.742 --> 03:21:15.203]  And it's basically like what Twitter was in 2014-2015.
[03:21:15.203 --> 03:21:16.484]  Fun!
[03:21:16.484 --> 03:21:18.944]  You can say whatever you like without fear of getting banned.
[03:21:18.944 --> 03:21:23.906]  And the reason for that is that it's owned by two Russians.
[03:21:24.648 --> 03:21:38.917]  And what a pathetic commentary that is on the state of free speech in the West, that the fact that one of the last remaining social media platforms available, where you can have actual free speech, is owned and run by Russians.
[03:21:38.917 --> 03:21:40.958]  Interesting that, isn't it?
[03:21:40.958 --> 03:21:45.701]  Similar to the VK website, which I don't even use anymore, but it's like the Russian Facebook.
[03:21:45.701 --> 03:21:48.383]  Never got banned on that!
[03:21:48.383 --> 03:21:52.926]  I'm thinking of downloading Weibo, which is literally the communist Chinese social media app.
[03:21:53.519 --> 03:21:57.601]  Probably be alright, as long as you don't criticise the communist Chinese government.
[03:21:57.601 --> 03:22:11.566]  So, a bunch of people, who've been completely banned by every other social media network, joined Telegram within the past few days, and their follower rates are absolutely skyrocketing for the limited time they've been on there.
[03:22:11.566 --> 03:22:14.788]  And guess what the Daily Beast did in response?
[03:22:14.788 --> 03:22:18.809]  They wrote an article demanding that Telegram ban these people.
[03:22:18.809 --> 03:22:22.971]  Headline, Laura Loomer and Milo Yiannopoulos find life after Facebook on Telegram.
[03:22:24.582 --> 03:22:28.863]  Will Sommer, who is basically the king of de-platforming.
[03:22:28.863 --> 03:22:44.007]  After Facebook cracked down on right-wing extremists last week, many of the far-right's loudest voices found themselves gravitating towards what appears to be their next digital home, an encrypted messaging app previously known as a haven for terrorist recruiters.
[03:22:44.007 --> 03:22:48.228]  So if you've used Telegram, you must be a terrorist recruiter, right?
[03:22:48.228 --> 03:22:52.129]  In the first paragraph, they smear the users of this app
[03:22:52.970 --> 03:22:59.192]  Who have been silenced on everything else, in the same breath as terrorist recruiters.
[03:22:59.192 --> 03:23:02.774]  These are the dirty smear merchants, this is what they do.
[03:23:02.774 --> 03:23:08.636]  Telegram is a platform that allows users to offer short, public-facing posts akin to a Twitter profile page, God forbid.
[03:23:08.636 --> 03:23:13.118]  It's universe of users is much smaller, however.
[03:23:13.118 --> 03:23:17.059]  Well, doesn't look to be that small given the amount of followers they've got in three days.
[03:23:17.059 --> 03:23:21.001]  It's user setup makes it harder for one to grow a following.
[03:23:21.593 --> 03:23:22.494]  Really?
[03:23:22.494 --> 03:23:27.016]  Well, I've grown 6,200 followers overnight, so it's not too bad.
[03:23:27.016 --> 03:23:39.103]  But for the purposes of those banished from the established platforms, figures like anti-Muslim activist Laura Loomer and right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos of Platforms Channels have had to do the trick.
[03:23:39.103 --> 03:23:41.724]  So, Laura Loomer's on there.
[03:23:41.724 --> 03:23:44.846]  Very interesting feed that Laura Loomer's got today.
[03:23:44.846 --> 03:23:48.608]  If you want to talk about how social media silencing
[03:23:49.306 --> 03:24:00.190]  Completely ruins people's lives then that seems to be what what's happened in the case of Laura Loomer Unfortunately, everybody shouldn't hold her in their best wishes So telegram is really popping off.
[03:24:00.190 --> 03:24:09.974]  It's like Twitter was four or five years ago It's actually fun and you can put your content on there without fear of being banned Nobody's been banned yet as far as I know that's been prominent.
[03:24:09.974 --> 03:24:16.157]  So that is a good way to go in terms of at least maintaining some kind of voice online and
[03:24:17.105 --> 03:24:20.546]  Now, of course, Alex was talking about this story before the break.
[03:24:20.546 --> 03:24:23.208]  It's up on Summit.News.
[03:24:23.208 --> 03:24:27.229]  Instagram to fact check and remove memes.
[03:24:27.229 --> 03:24:33.692]  Instagram has announced that it will begin fact checking and removing memes because you're a child and you can't handle memes.
[03:24:33.692 --> 03:24:35.513]  They may be offensive.
[03:24:35.513 --> 03:24:37.414]  You've got an infantilized mind.
[03:24:37.414 --> 03:24:43.796]  You've been told to be triggered by literally everything and break down in crying fits at the sight of something you disagree with.
[03:24:43.796 --> 03:24:45.437]  So it needs to be controlled.
[03:24:46.434 --> 03:24:56.979]  The social media giant, which is owned by Facebook, will use its 52 global fact-checking partners to censor false photos and memes on its platform.
[03:24:56.979 --> 03:25:00.620]  No doubt blurring out Alex Jones's face in his family photographs.
[03:25:00.620 --> 03:25:09.404]  Because during the two minutes of hate against Goldstein, unlike in 1984, where they could actually see Goldstein, you can't see Alex Jones.
[03:25:09.404 --> 03:25:11.045]  Because he's worse than Goldstein.
[03:25:11.974 --> 03:25:19.296]  Instagram is taking those fact checks and applying them to the same false photos and memes on its platform, according to the report.
[03:25:19.296 --> 03:25:22.417]  A meme isn't a statement of fact.
[03:25:22.417 --> 03:25:28.998]  In what universe do you need to fact check a meme, you authoritarian bastards?
[03:25:28.998 --> 03:25:32.619]  This is the level of control that they want.
[03:25:32.619 --> 03:25:33.700]  They're not content.
[03:25:33.700 --> 03:25:34.780]  They just keep going.
[03:25:36.405 --> 03:25:42.208]  Memes deemed factually incorrect will no longer appear under tabs where they can be discovered by random users.
[03:25:42.208 --> 03:25:45.629]  And that's the entire point.
[03:25:45.629 --> 03:25:50.432]  So you're always preaching to the choir even if you've got a platform remaining on Instagram.
[03:25:50.432 --> 03:25:53.473]  Only the people who choose to follow you can see what you post.
[03:25:53.473 --> 03:25:56.575]  You'll never appear under the other tabs.
[03:25:56.575 --> 03:26:00.897]  So new users, random users, will never see your content.
[03:26:00.897 --> 03:26:03.398]  The Poynter Institute, which partners with Facebook,
[03:26:04.181 --> 03:26:06.643]  And this is where the article came out about this.
[03:26:06.643 --> 03:26:12.146]  Recently had to shut down its own database highlighting unreliable news sites.
[03:26:12.146 --> 03:26:17.689]  After discovering inconsistencies between sources used to build the database in its final report.
[03:26:17.689 --> 03:26:25.614]  So the database which they built to target and highlight unreliable news sites was unreliable.
[03:26:25.614 --> 03:26:26.515]  So you can trust them.
[03:26:27.515 --> 03:26:30.197]  So again, the Poynter Institute is like Newsguard.
[03:26:30.197 --> 03:26:42.485]  It's like all these other fact-checking websites like Snopes, which is literally a far-left blog run by a cat lady and somebody who was accused of embezzling a bunch of money.
[03:26:42.485 --> 03:26:44.967]  But they're trustworthy, they're credible, you can trust them.
[03:26:44.967 --> 03:26:47.308]  Literally a mouthpiece to the Democratic Party.
[03:26:47.308 --> 03:26:48.549]  But they're neutral.
[03:26:48.549 --> 03:26:49.410]  They're neutral.
[03:26:49.410 --> 03:26:51.551]  Facebook will partner with them.
[03:26:51.551 --> 03:26:52.532]  They're going to be running this.
[03:26:54.019 --> 03:26:57.181]  And people may ask, why the need to fact-check memes?
[03:26:57.181 --> 03:27:07.126]  Well, it's not a mystery at all, because as I've proven and written about in the past, studies have repeatedly shown that the political right is far better at spreading memes.
[03:27:07.126 --> 03:27:11.509]  Of course, one of the reasons for that is that memes are generally a little bit offensive,
[03:27:12.125 --> 03:27:13.426]  Little bit cheeky.
[03:27:13.426 --> 03:27:15.347]  Little bit mischievous.
[03:27:15.347 --> 03:27:18.149]  And the political right is quite prepared to do that.
[03:27:18.149 --> 03:27:21.471]  Not the left because they're permanently walking on eggshells.
[03:27:21.471 --> 03:27:31.958]  Because, you know, anything humorous, anything satirical that isn't orange man bad might transgress some politically correct thought crime.
[03:27:31.958 --> 03:27:33.559]  So that's why the left sucks.
[03:27:33.559 --> 03:27:34.840]  That's why the left can't meme.
[03:27:35.925 --> 03:27:37.146]  And they've done studies on this.
[03:27:37.146 --> 03:27:45.894]  A study undertaken by researchers at University College London found that the most effective memes largely originated in two places.
[03:27:45.894 --> 03:27:59.025]  The subreddit, the Donald, which of course was a major online presence, major influence in rallying Trump's base and getting him elected, and 4chan's politically incorrect poll forum.
[03:27:59.025 --> 03:28:02.348]  So the best, the most effective memes usually
[03:28:03.101 --> 03:28:05.843]  As this last study showed, come out of those two places.
[03:28:05.843 --> 03:28:11.085]  Of course, those are typically right-wing content forums.
[03:28:11.085 --> 03:28:17.809]  A Vice write-up study acknowledges that the most effectively spread memes originated on the Donald and Paul.
[03:28:17.809 --> 03:28:24.733]  So, of course, if you can't create the memes, if you can't spread the memes, let's just ban memes!
[03:28:24.733 --> 03:28:27.754]  Of course, that's the new go-to solution.
[03:28:27.754 --> 03:28:29.055]  And in fact, there was another article
[03:28:30.197 --> 03:28:38.762]  Which was, I think it was during the State of the Union speech, headline, Buzzfeed lobbies Twitter to ban memes that make fun of blackface Democrats.
[03:28:38.762 --> 03:28:44.825]  That was obviously during the time when the Virginia Governor Ralph Northam scandal was emerging.
[03:28:44.825 --> 03:28:46.606]  And we had the meme of the
[03:28:47.726 --> 03:28:52.891]  When the women, the Democratic Congress women, wearing the white clothes in Klan hoods, BuzzFeed wanted to ban that.
[03:28:52.891 --> 03:28:54.072]  We'll get into it more after the break.
[03:28:54.072 --> 03:28:55.533]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:55.533 --> 03:29:02.438]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[03:29:02.438 --> 03:29:10.785]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:10.785 --> 03:29:16.470]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:29:16.630 --> 03:29:18.471]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:29:18.471 --> 03:29:20.633]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:20.633 --> 03:29:25.137]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:29:25.137 --> 03:29:27.319]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:29:27.319 --> 03:29:35.065]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:29:54.501 --> 03:29:57.543]  Our grandparents, great-grandparents, they canned food.
[03:29:57.543 --> 03:29:59.085]  During the fall, they'd have it during the winter.
[03:30:00.453 --> 03:30:03.415]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[03:30:03.415 --> 03:30:07.978]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply on the top.

[03:30:40.543 --> 03:30:43.065]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.

[03:30:54.252 --> 03:30:56.654]  Stacy in the great state of Texas.
[03:30:57.671 --> 03:31:00.754]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:31:13.448 --> 03:31:19.434]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[03:31:19.434 --> 03:31:20.194]  I appreciate that.
[03:31:20.194 --> 03:31:21.796]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:31:21.796 --> 03:31:22.396]  Tell us about it.
[03:31:22.396 --> 03:31:23.177]  Well, it's really great.
[03:31:23.177 --> 03:31:24.478]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:31:24.478 --> 03:31:24.979]  I take it.
[03:31:24.979 --> 03:31:25.739]  It tastes good.
[03:31:25.739 --> 03:31:27.581]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:31:27.581 --> 03:31:29.543]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:31:29.543 --> 03:31:33.026]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[03:31:33.046 --> 03:31:35.868]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:31:35.868 --> 03:31:37.629]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:31:37.629 --> 03:31:39.710]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:31:39.710 --> 03:31:40.611]  So, yeah.
[03:31:40.611 --> 03:31:43.052]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[03:31:43.052 --> 03:31:45.894]  These are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[03:31:45.894 --> 03:31:47.035]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[03:31:47.035 --> 03:31:48.836]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:31:53.593 --> 03:31:58.818]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[03:31:58.818 --> 03:32:07.385]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:32:07.385 --> 03:32:10.347]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:32:10.347 --> 03:32:12.109]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:32:12.109 --> 03:32:18.374]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[03:32:20.456 --> 03:32:25.778]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[03:32:25.778 --> 03:32:28.740]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:32:28.740 --> 03:32:32.661]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:32:32.661 --> 03:32:36.643]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:32:36.643 --> 03:32:38.464]  I've got two in my home.
[03:32:38.464 --> 03:32:44.586]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:32:44.586 --> 03:32:45.407]  Don't live
[03:32:46.247 --> 03:32:50.312]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[03:32:50.312 --> 03:32:57.241]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:57.241 --> 03:32:59.864]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:10.996 --> 03:33:12.236]  You found it.
[03:33:12.236 --> 03:33:14.277]  The tip of the spear.
[03:33:14.277 --> 03:33:17.278]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.278 --> 03:33:23.681]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:23.681 --> 03:33:33.344]  So back on the Alex Jones Show, before we get into some more news, I want to tell you about some of the great specials available right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:33:33.344 --> 03:33:36.885]  Because unlike Vice Media, which just received a $250 million check,
[03:33:39.318 --> 03:33:45.401]  From, amongst other people, George Soros, you don't get $250 million checks from anyone.
[03:33:45.401 --> 03:33:50.644]  Which is why we need to sell products, even though the media laughs at us and says, oh my God, how dare you sell products?
[03:33:50.644 --> 03:33:52.305]  How embarrassing is that?
[03:33:52.305 --> 03:34:00.189]  Even though most of them have got massive five-star reviews, everyone loves them, and we've got several great specials on offer again today.
[03:34:00.189 --> 03:34:06.373]  Of course, now that we've been completely de-platformed off of absolutely everything, we need your support more than ever.
[03:34:07.068 --> 03:34:10.652]  We have the InfoWars Life Protein Bars available right now.
[03:34:10.652 --> 03:34:14.435]  You can get a whole box for just $36.
[03:34:14.435 --> 03:34:16.777]  Protein-packed power on the go.
[03:34:16.777 --> 03:34:23.364]  The InfoWars Life Protein Bars are perfect as meal alternatives, pre- or post-workout snacks, or fuel for when you need it.
[03:34:23.364 --> 03:34:29.550]  These are, unlike some protein bars, which are obviously way for thin and flimsy,
[03:34:30.808 --> 03:34:33.969]  These are big chunky bars covered in chocolate.
[03:34:33.969 --> 03:34:40.471]  You can get the peanut butter one and you can get the vanilla coconut and chocolate.
[03:34:40.471 --> 03:34:43.492]  Protein bar available right now, whole box of them for $36.
[03:34:43.492 --> 03:34:50.614]  That's a saving of $12, 25% on the usual price.
[03:34:50.614 --> 03:34:53.475]  You can also get TurboForce right now for a massive 33% saving.
[03:34:56.365 --> 03:35:02.747]  With a long list of powerful time-tested ingredients, TurboForce will soon be your number one go-to source for quick, accessible energy.
[03:35:02.747 --> 03:35:05.747]  130 independent certified reviews.
[03:35:05.747 --> 03:35:11.089]  97% of respondents would recommend this to a friend.
[03:35:11.089 --> 03:35:13.549]  Ton of five-star reviews.
[03:35:13.549 --> 03:35:17.590]  And be careful, because it... it is powerful!
[03:35:17.590 --> 03:35:21.191]  I mean, you could only take half a sachet of this, so even if you got a box of it,
[03:35:21.832 --> 03:35:26.373]  Which is $39.95, again, a saving of $20, which is 33%.
[03:35:26.373 --> 03:35:28.913]  Even if you got a box of it, you could probably extend the life.
[03:35:28.913 --> 03:35:31.554]  Probably shouldn't even be telling you that because we make less money.
[03:35:31.554 --> 03:35:37.075]  But this is so powerful that just to start off with, you should probably take it steady.
[03:35:37.075 --> 03:35:43.236]  This will wake you up like nothing else and give you energy without that junky comedown.
[03:35:43.236 --> 03:35:48.998]  And you've also got, at InfoWarsStore.com, the Daily Support Combo Pack.
[03:35:48.998 --> 03:35:50.818]  That is Brain Force Plus.
[03:35:51.616 --> 03:35:57.833]  Available right now £29.95 you get the knockout free with that a massive 57% saving
[03:36:00.487 --> 03:36:02.288]  Knockout is, of course, the sleep support.
[03:36:02.288 --> 03:36:07.693]  Perhaps you should take the Knockout after you've taken the TurboForce because you may need it.
[03:36:07.693 --> 03:36:11.015]  But also the BrainForce, of course, for cognitive functioning.
[03:36:11.015 --> 03:36:15.238]  Clarity really helps you concentrate when you're doing any kind of mental work.
[03:36:15.238 --> 03:36:19.322]  It is available right now in the form of the Daily Support Combo Pack.
[03:36:19.322 --> 03:36:24.345]  That's BrainForce with the free bottle of Knockout for just £29.95.
[03:36:24.345 --> 03:36:27.488]  Available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:36:28.140 --> 03:36:30.322]  Please support us there today.
[03:36:30.322 --> 03:36:42.171]  Now, of course, the new reality of things is that allowing a billionaire oligarch monopolist to decide who has free speech and what opinions you can have is progressive.
[03:36:42.171 --> 03:36:55.562]  And the opinions that were expressed by this state representative, who literally went around on camera harassing old women and teenage girls, that's an acceptable opinion to have and to broadcast on Facebook.
[03:36:56.354 --> 03:36:56.935]  Headline!
[03:36:56.935 --> 03:37:02.819]  Facebook takes no action against State Rep who threatened to dox teenage pro-lifers on video.
[03:37:02.819 --> 03:37:05.282]  You can threaten to dox children.
[03:37:05.282 --> 03:37:12.047]  You can threaten to assassinate the President and the person who gets reported those threats gets banned from Facebook.
[03:37:12.047 --> 03:37:13.148]  You can support Hamas.
[03:37:13.148 --> 03:37:14.830]  You can support all kinds of terrorist groups.
[03:37:14.830 --> 03:37:18.172]  You can support Antifa, domestic terrorist groups.
[03:37:18.172 --> 03:37:19.453]  That's just fine.
[03:37:19.453 --> 03:37:23.577]  Facebook has taken no action against abortion activist and State Rep Brian Sims.
[03:37:24.571 --> 03:37:28.933]  After he brazenly tried to dox a group of teenage girls on video.
[03:37:28.933 --> 03:37:30.174]  The clip is in the article.
[03:37:30.174 --> 03:37:31.515]  He basically walks up to them.
[03:37:31.515 --> 03:37:38.798]  They're holding a small protest outside a planned parenthood clinic in southern Pennsylvania.
[03:37:38.798 --> 03:37:40.679]  And he says, on video, here's the deal.
[03:37:40.679 --> 03:37:44.741]  I've got $100 for anybody who will identify any of these three.
[03:37:44.741 --> 03:37:46.942]  He then uses white people as a slur.
[03:37:46.942 --> 03:37:49.083]  This is one of his favorite tactics.
[03:37:49.083 --> 03:37:50.184]  Despite the fact that
[03:37:50.939 --> 03:37:59.082]  One of the girls, the children that he's harassing and doxing, or threatening to dox, isn't even white!
[03:37:59.082 --> 03:38:08.584]  So this guy, who's white, continually uses the term white people as a slur, like it's automatically a pejorative, proving he's a racist.
[03:38:08.584 --> 03:38:19.888]  And then he, not only on camera, but in the Facebook post itself, as if there was any confusion about this, in the Facebook post itself, which has been up for over three weeks on Facebook,
[03:38:21.081 --> 03:38:23.803]  He says, so let's make the most of it!
[03:38:23.803 --> 03:38:32.450]  I'll donate $100 to Planned Parenthood if anyone who knows who these awful people are, who'll join me in that $100.
[03:38:32.450 --> 03:38:41.237]  So he's on tape harassing teenage girls who are staging what looks like a peaceful protest outside a Planned Parenthood clinic.
[03:38:41.237 --> 03:38:42.678]  They leave when he turns up.
[03:38:43.775 --> 03:38:46.656]  Not only is he harassing them, he's harassing another young man.
[03:38:46.656 --> 03:38:55.577]  He's offering, on camera, with his, I think he's got like 200,000 followers on Facebook, $100 for their identities to be revealed.
[03:38:55.577 --> 03:39:00.858]  That's doxing, but no, that's fine because he's an abortion activist, he's on the left.
[03:39:00.858 --> 03:39:03.379]  Different rules apply.
[03:39:03.379 --> 03:39:10.400]  Despite the post being reported numerous times after it received attention on Twitter yesterday, neither Twitter nor Facebook has taken any action against Sims.
[03:39:11.798 --> 03:39:21.806]  While myself and others were banned by Facebook for nebulous hate, Sims is allowed to deliberately break Facebook's terms of service with zero consequences.
[03:39:21.806 --> 03:39:28.831]  He also posted another video in which he harasses an old lady which could also be argued violates Facebook policies on bullying and harassment.
[03:39:28.831 --> 03:39:31.614]  But there's no political bias.
[03:39:31.614 --> 03:39:33.115]  Honest.
[03:39:33.115 --> 03:39:40.921]  So the way you're gonna get around this is by claiming that because he's an elected official, different rules apply to him.
[03:39:41.707 --> 03:39:50.054]  That he can get away with certain things because that behaviour needs to be seen by the voting public.
[03:39:50.054 --> 03:39:51.375]  That's not the case though, is it?
[03:39:51.375 --> 03:40:02.805]  When Paul Benjamin and when Tommy Robinson tried to sign up for accounts on Twitter to become elected representatives, their accounts were immediately banned.
[03:40:02.805 --> 03:40:07.309]  So this rule about what elected representatives or people running for office can get away with
[03:40:08.050 --> 03:40:14.376]  Seems to differ based on the political persuasion of who's doing it.
[03:40:14.376 --> 03:40:15.857]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:40:15.857 --> 03:40:19.120]  Once again, another giant double standard.
[03:40:19.120 --> 03:40:22.983]  Now, Stephen Crowder tweeted about this earlier.
[03:40:22.983 --> 03:40:31.411]  Dem Brian Sims claims to be a feminist while advocating for Sharia law, harassing young girls and offering money to dox them.
[03:40:31.411 --> 03:40:32.832]  That's liberal, that's progressive.
[03:40:33.579 --> 03:40:40.866]  Ensuring born male athletes can take athletic titles from biological women, which he also did in another post.
[03:40:40.866 --> 03:40:46.011]  How long will we pretend that Democrats care about women at all?
[03:40:46.011 --> 03:40:51.296]  So this guy is up harassing young teenage girls, harassing old ladies, threatening to dox them.
[03:40:51.296 --> 03:40:58.642]  His post, his video, has been on Twitter, on Facebook, but over three weeks absolutely nothing happens.
[03:40:58.642 --> 03:40:59.083]  Meanwhile,
[03:41:00.839 --> 03:41:05.263]  Twitter bans Jewish Trump supporter over AOC parody account.
[03:41:05.263 --> 03:41:08.847]  You can't make fun of Democrats.
[03:41:08.847 --> 03:41:21.560]  And it was interesting actually in relation to this, somebody posted a tweet from, I think it's a verified liberal, let's put it that way, whether it's a journalist, I haven't looked into it, but she's called Molly Jongfast.
[03:41:23.067 --> 03:41:35.320]  So when this Jewish Trump supporter, who by the way I met at CPAC, absolutely fun-loving, hilarious guy, nice guy to the nth degree, when he got banned for this AOC parody account,
[03:41:37.009 --> 03:41:39.891]  She said this, this is Molly Jongfast on Twitter.
[03:41:39.891 --> 03:41:44.915]  This AOC parody account was incredibly mean and often retweeted as fact.
[03:41:44.915 --> 03:41:48.177]  Now conservatives are absolutely furious that it's been taken down.
[03:41:48.177 --> 03:41:53.441]  Imagine if there was a parody account making fun of young conservative congressmen with the same zeal.
[03:41:53.441 --> 03:41:55.362]  They'd be apoplectic.
[03:41:55.362 --> 03:41:58.725]  But then he flashes back to a tweet from March last year.
[03:41:59.557 --> 03:42:12.687]  Where this same verified liberal on Twitter says, Oh, so again we see the double standard.
[03:42:12.687 --> 03:42:16.069]  Parody accounts targeting Conservatives, Republicans, that's just fine.
[03:42:16.069 --> 03:42:23.375]  Parody accounts targeting liberal leftist Democrat darlings like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that's verboten.
[03:42:24.005 --> 03:42:38.033]  And now, not only did Twitter ban the parody account, even though it said parody in the bio twice, conformed to all their rules, they banned the creator, Michael J. Morrison, just as a kind of another way to lash out.
[03:42:38.033 --> 03:42:39.314]  And he's been banned, he had
[03:42:40.462 --> 03:42:42.262]  50,000 followers.
[03:42:42.262 --> 03:42:43.363]  I think 60,000 followers.
[03:42:43.363 --> 03:42:43.763]  He's gone.
[03:42:43.763 --> 03:42:46.363]  The parody account had 85,000 followers.
[03:42:46.363 --> 03:42:49.204]  That's gone, even though parody accounts are completely allowed.
[03:42:49.204 --> 03:42:50.724]  He said it was a parody account.
[03:42:50.724 --> 03:42:51.584]  Doesn't matter.
[03:42:51.584 --> 03:42:52.264]  Bye-bye.
[03:42:52.264 --> 03:42:53.144]  You're gone.
[03:42:53.144 --> 03:42:58.345]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[03:42:58.345 --> 03:43:06.907]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:43:06.907 --> 03:43:09.467]  Some of the most polluted areas on Earth are major cities.
[03:43:09.887 --> 03:43:11.629]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:43:11.629 --> 03:43:25.342]  So we have air filters at InfowarsStore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.
[03:43:25.342 --> 03:43:28.284]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:43:28.284 --> 03:43:31.868]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:43:32.188 --> 03:43:36.172]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:43:36.172 --> 03:43:38.014]  I've got two in my home.
[03:43:38.014 --> 03:43:44.100]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:43:44.100 --> 03:43:48.765]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[03:43:48.765 --> 03:43:49.846]  Have clean air.
[03:43:49.846 --> 03:43:51.127]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:54.161 --> 03:43:55.582]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:43:55.582 --> 03:43:57.483]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:43:57.483 --> 03:43:58.083]  It is.
[03:43:58.083 --> 03:44:02.967]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:44:02.967 --> 03:44:04.307]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:44:04.307 --> 03:44:06.129]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:44:06.129 --> 03:44:08.610]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:44:08.610 --> 03:44:10.251]  Brain, body, heart.
[03:44:10.251 --> 03:44:11.692]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[03:44:11.692 --> 03:44:13.073]  You've got the children's.
[03:44:13.073 --> 03:44:14.174]  You've got the adults.
[03:44:14.174 --> 03:44:15.194]  You've got the krill oil.
[03:44:15.194 --> 03:44:18.576]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[03:44:18.576 --> 03:44:20.938]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[03:44:21.158 --> 03:44:22.499]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:44:22.499 --> 03:44:23.259]  And I'm sorry.
[03:44:23.259 --> 03:44:24.359]  You want something like this?
[03:44:24.359 --> 03:44:25.320]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:44:25.320 --> 03:44:27.240]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:44:27.240 --> 03:44:27.861]  It's so good.
[03:44:27.861 --> 03:44:28.481]  It might be.
[03:44:28.481 --> 03:44:30.802]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:44:30.802 --> 03:44:33.503]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:44:33.503 --> 03:44:36.884]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:44:36.884 --> 03:44:41.446]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:44:44.414 --> 03:44:50.453]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:44:50.453 --> 03:44:51.155]  I just can't do it!

[03:47:13.279 --> 03:47:26.385]  We're back live for the final segment of the Alex Jones Show in this fourth hour.
[03:47:26.385 --> 03:47:32.928]  Now remember, amidst all this de-platforming, there are some platforms left that actually believe in free speech.
[03:47:32.928 --> 03:47:35.850]  One of them is Telegram, and you can go and sign up.
[03:47:35.850 --> 03:47:36.430]  You can download
[03:47:37.222 --> 03:47:39.543]  The desktop version and the app.
[03:47:39.543 --> 03:47:41.283]  And it's basically a free speech platform.
[03:47:41.283 --> 03:47:48.665]  It's actually fun, because, you know, you're not gonna get banned for expressing an opinion or posting, God forbid, a meme.
[03:47:48.665 --> 03:47:51.646]  And Milo's on there, a bunch of people are on there.
[03:47:51.646 --> 03:47:56.307]  I'm on there at t.me slash pjwnews.
[03:47:56.307 --> 03:47:59.988]  t.me slash pjwnews.
[03:47:59.988 --> 03:48:06.330]  Uh, Rob Dew's got his own channel, which is just dark, which is t.me slash dewsnews, with a Z at the end.
[03:48:07.142 --> 03:48:09.643]  T dot me slash dudes news with a Z at the end.
[03:48:09.643 --> 03:48:11.124]  It's a lot of fun.
[03:48:11.124 --> 03:48:15.166]  I basically got like nearly 7,000 followers in less than 24 hours.
[03:48:15.166 --> 03:48:20.949]  So that is a platform which you can actually use with some element of confidence.
[03:48:20.949 --> 03:48:24.451]  I've also got a subscribe star if you want to support me.
[03:48:24.451 --> 03:48:27.292]  Obviously this deplatforming has led to a backlash.
[03:48:27.292 --> 03:48:28.793]  It will lead to a further backlash.
[03:48:30.277 --> 03:48:33.381]  And you can support me in that at Subscribestar.
[03:48:33.381 --> 03:48:35.423]  You just google Subscribestar.
[03:48:35.423 --> 03:48:37.285]  Paul Joseph Watson, that will come up.
[03:48:37.285 --> 03:48:39.067]  You can support me there.
[03:48:39.067 --> 03:48:48.577]  Very interesting feedback from the lawyers who said, and I quote, that it was, let me find the exact quote here,
[03:48:49.784 --> 03:48:53.868]  The decision for Facebook to ban me was, quote, fairly extraordinary.
[03:48:53.868 --> 03:48:59.433]  So looks like we might have an interesting avenue to pursue there with the best media lawyers in London.
[03:48:59.433 --> 03:49:03.677]  That's going to be interesting to find out exactly what information they had on me, isn't it?
[03:49:03.677 --> 03:49:12.926]  So please support me by going to Subscribestar, Paul Joseph Watson, and you can join the Telegram groups, t.me forward slash Dews News and

[03:49:17.306 --> 03:49:22.911]  There you see the subscribe star up on screen.
[03:49:22.911 --> 03:49:26.594]  Now CNN seems to be in trouble once again.
[03:49:26.594 --> 03:49:27.955]  This is up at summit.news.
[03:49:27.955 --> 03:49:30.057]  Rumors swirl about huge layoffs at CNN.
[03:49:30.057 --> 03:49:32.259]  Brian Stelter denies.
[03:49:32.259 --> 03:49:39.706]  After the network lost 26% of its audience in the past year, there are now rumors swirling that huge layoffs are about to hit CNN.
[03:49:40.760 --> 03:49:48.668]  FTV Live reports, quote, CNN will cut as many as 300 employees, many being older employees, with years at the network.
[03:49:48.668 --> 03:49:55.174]  So they allege that 200 people will be given a pink slip and 100 more will be offered a buyout, according to this report.
[03:49:55.174 --> 03:50:03.241]  It's being described as a brain drain because it will mainly impact veteran reporters and employees.
[03:50:03.241 --> 03:50:03.702]  However,
[03:50:04.602 --> 03:50:11.206]  CNN's Brian Stelter denied the story, tweeting, There's a rumor making the rounds today about big impending layoffs at CNN.
[03:50:11.206 --> 03:50:14.709]  Surely that's impossible, given that they've lost quarter of their audience in a year.
[03:50:14.709 --> 03:50:19.452]  The CNN spokeswoman is knocking it down on the record, no layoffs.
[03:50:19.452 --> 03:50:24.395]  There were voluntary buyouts throughout the organization, and about 100 people opted for it.
[03:50:24.395 --> 03:50:32.300]  Then Eric Erickson responded, With this, voluntary layoffs typically happen prior to a company doing layoffs.
[03:50:33.138 --> 03:50:37.839]  AT&T, which now owns CNN, is notorious for doing this.
[03:50:37.839 --> 03:50:41.901]  If enough volunteers walk the plank, no one else is forced to.
[03:50:41.901 --> 03:50:45.542]  So he's saying that they tried to get as many people to walk the plank as possible.
[03:50:45.542 --> 03:50:50.743]  If that number is not high enough, then the layoffs will follow.
[03:50:50.743 --> 03:50:55.185]  And as we report, of course, their viewership is down 26% in a year.
[03:50:55.185 --> 03:51:00.126]  The network's flagship primetime show, Cuomo Primetime, grew a total of just 917,000 views in April, which is
[03:51:02.916 --> 03:51:04.937]  It's worse performance ever.
[03:51:04.937 --> 03:51:23.104]  And it's just a coincidence that Brian Stelter and Oliver Doughty, who funnily enough used to send tweets bashing CNN back in 2014-2015, then he failed as a conservative commentator, joined CNN and devoted his career to de-platforming, dragging down everyone else.
[03:51:23.104 --> 03:51:25.085]  Interesting that they're now denying this.
[03:51:25.085 --> 03:51:28.046]  We shall see.
[03:51:28.046 --> 03:51:28.486]  Meanwhile,
[03:51:29.753 --> 03:51:35.295]  Vice commences master brand strategy, folding standalone Waypoint and Broadly brands.
[03:51:35.295 --> 03:51:41.097]  So of course we had massive layoffs from BuzzFeed a couple of months ago and then Vice had to follow suit.
[03:51:41.097 --> 03:51:52.542]  Well now Vice has started consolidating and rebranding its media verticals under Vice, folding the standalone Tonic, Noisy, Waypoint and Broadly brands.
[03:51:52.542 --> 03:51:53.082]  In fact I think
[03:51:54.381 --> 03:52:01.663]  Broadly had a YouTube channel and it was so pathetic it could barely get like a thousand views per video at one point.
[03:52:01.663 --> 03:52:08.764]  The digital media company aims to boost site traffic and cross pollinate readers across these once distinct and separate sections.
[03:52:08.764 --> 03:52:16.606]  In 2018 Vice Media missed its revenue goals and then months later cut staff by 10% which was around 250 people.
[03:52:16.606 --> 03:52:21.067]  But don't worry because guess who's riding to the rescue?
[03:52:21.067 --> 03:52:23.107]  It's he who shall not be named!
[03:52:24.187 --> 03:52:25.628]  Otherwise you're an anti-Semite.
[03:52:25.628 --> 03:52:26.929]  Yes, it's George Soros.
[03:52:26.929 --> 03:52:30.092]  It's a similar kind of situation to Facebook.
[03:52:30.092 --> 03:52:39.819]  You can only talk about, it's the flip side of the Alex Jones equation, you can only talk about George Soros if you're being polite and complimentary towards George Soros.
[03:52:39.819 --> 03:52:47.525]  Anything negative, because of course there'd be nothing negative about a billionaire philanthropist who funds political movements worldwide,
[03:52:48.174 --> 03:52:50.735]  There'd be nothing negative about that right now.
[03:52:50.735 --> 03:52:52.516]  It all has to be positive.
[03:52:52.516 --> 03:52:56.398]  Don't criticise George Soros or you hate Jewish people.
[03:52:56.398 --> 03:53:01.760]  Vice Media raises $250 million.
[03:53:01.760 --> 03:53:05.262]  God only knows how or why, given that it's a failing brand.
[03:53:05.262 --> 03:53:07.003]  Nobody's interested in it.
[03:53:07.003 --> 03:53:14.726]  But again, it's one of the pillars of the left-wing digital media establishment, so they have to rescue it.
[03:53:14.726 --> 03:53:15.847]  It's too big to fail.
[03:53:16.585 --> 03:53:33.355]  Now, Vice Media, the Canadian digital venture, formed out of Vice Magazine, of course by Gavin McInnes, who is now completely de-platformed off everything, has raised $250 million in debt from investors, including George Soros.
[03:53:33.355 --> 03:53:38.839]  The financier's company is one of a number of investors in the round that has been led by 23 Capital.
[03:53:38.839 --> 03:53:45.303]  So they've got a bunch of other investors, which include Shane Smith, obviously the co-founder, the Walt Disney Company,
[03:53:46.155 --> 03:53:49.379]  A&E Networks and TPG Capital.
[03:53:49.379 --> 03:53:56.446]  So the corporate behemoths are rushing with the safety net in which to catch vice as it crumbles and collapses.
[03:53:56.446 --> 03:54:03.353]  So with a $250 million injection, for the foreseeable future at least, they'll be just fine.
[03:54:03.353 --> 03:54:07.778]  We might not be fine, that's why you need to get the products right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:10.479 --> 03:54:14.381]  Now, we also have an article up on The Federalist.
[03:54:14.381 --> 03:54:22.246]  This is a long article, I'm not going to go through it all, but I really recommend you read it, because it's a great breakdown of what's happened over the past week with the de-platforming.
[03:54:22.246 --> 03:54:28.749]  Kicking people off online platforms is about control, not free speech.
[03:54:28.749 --> 03:54:33.052]  And this is a long article, but they go through it and they make the point.
[03:54:33.052 --> 03:54:37.354]  Those critiqued here who may dismiss the critique as whataboutism, basically he's saying
[03:54:38.101 --> 03:54:42.842]  No one need defend any of the people recently deplatformed by Facebook and Twitter.
[03:54:42.842 --> 03:54:55.684]  To understand that the debate is really about an establishment desperate to regain the gatekeeping power they believed they lost as a result of satellite technology and the internet.
[03:54:55.684 --> 03:54:59.545]  And of course, as a consequence of which led to Donald Trump's election in 2016.
[03:54:59.545 --> 03:55:07.206]  That is a key article to understand exactly why they're doing the deplatforming and why they're doing it now.
[03:55:08.783 --> 03:55:18.886]  Meanwhile in Europe, where you can increasingly not talk about any of these issues, otherwise you faced arrest and imprisonment, beyond even social media de-platforming.
[03:55:18.886 --> 03:55:20.046]  This is out of Breitbart.
[03:55:20.046 --> 03:55:23.728]  Television crew attacked while filming report on emerging migrant no-go zone.
[03:55:23.728 --> 03:55:31.270]  This is in Belgium, capital of Brussels, which we were chased out of a few years ago after the Paris massacre.
[03:55:31.974 --> 03:55:51.647]  A television crew working for Belgian broadcaster RTL was attacked by migrants at the Gare du Nord station in Brussels while they were filming an investigation on the refusal of bus drivers in the city to stop at the rapidly deteriorating location, which is something that we've seen before in two instances.
[03:55:51.647 --> 03:56:00.752]  One, the attacks on news reporters we saw in Malmo, Sweden, the vicious attack on the Australian news crew in a migrant hub.
[03:56:00.752 --> 03:56:01.273]  And of course,
[03:56:02.152 --> 03:56:14.539]  The issue of not only buses but postal services delivery companies refusing to deliver in these heavily migrant areas because of the rampant crime and the threat of theft.
[03:56:14.539 --> 03:56:20.462]  Some of the postal companies in Sweden have point-blank refused to even go to those areas.
[03:56:20.462 --> 03:56:22.943]  You can't even say that in Sweden, that's a hate crime basically.
[03:56:23.985 --> 03:56:39.128]  And now the television crew in Brussels were attacked on Sunday morning while the crew were trying to interview a bus driver and filming a bus belonging to the D-Legion company following a refusal of drivers to serve the major capital city transport interchange with their vehicles.
[03:56:39.128 --> 03:56:40.708]  So they were violently shoved.
[03:56:40.708 --> 03:56:45.669]  Again, same situation he had in Sweden is going on in Belgium.
[03:56:45.669 --> 03:56:50.130]  Meanwhile, Austrians say they're feeling like foreigners inside of their own country.
[03:56:50.130 --> 03:56:53.651]  Hundreds of working-class Austrians with real roots to the nation's culture and customs
[03:56:54.338 --> 03:57:02.981]  ...have expressed to one of the most popular newspapers their opinions on mass migration, with many saying they feel like outsiders in their own country.
[03:57:02.981 --> 03:57:05.862]  We also have this report, again out of Voice of Europe.
[03:57:05.862 --> 03:57:11.465]  Angela Merkel defends disastrous migrant policy, saying it was never a mistake to let in the millions of migrants.
[03:57:11.465 --> 03:57:17.587]  Well, it was a mistake for your political career, which was completely sunk as a result of that dreadful decision.
[03:57:19.511 --> 03:57:26.857]  Now Merkel said her migrant policy had been Germany's response to the exceptional situation generated by civil war in Syria and rampant ISIS terror threat in the Middle East.
[03:57:26.857 --> 03:57:35.343]  Now Germany's violent crime rate has skyrocketed and most of that is down to the migrants who came in since 2015.
[03:57:35.343 --> 03:57:38.506]  Not my opinion, German government statistics.
[03:57:38.506 --> 03:57:40.988]  Coming up next is War Room, breaking news at infowars.com.

[03:58:14.627 --> 03:58:16.289]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[03:58:16.289 --> 03:58:19.151]  And we decided, I like your Secret 12 Plus.
[03:58:19.151 --> 03:58:22.214]  But they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[03:58:22.214 --> 03:58:22.975]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[03:58:22.975 --> 03:58:23.696]  Well, you know what?
[03:58:23.696 --> 03:58:25.017]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[03:58:25.017 --> 03:58:26.999]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[03:58:26.999 --> 03:58:27.959]  We decided to change the name.
[03:58:27.959 --> 03:58:29.181]  So when you peel off the label...
[03:58:30.402 --> 03:58:34.109]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[03:58:34.109 --> 03:58:36.913]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.
