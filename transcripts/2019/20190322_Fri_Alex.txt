[00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:12.875]  You know about authoritarian regimes.
[00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:15.777]  They're lying about me and they're trying to de-platform me.
[00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:18.779]  26 companies working in concert violating the Sherman Antitrust Act.
[00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.863]  And now, Senator Warner and Senator Wyden have said, quote, there's thousands of sites worse than Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.383 --> 00:00:27.845]  So, we're becoming like Cuba, we're becoming like Vietnam, we're becoming like China.
[00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:37.592]  So regardless of what people think about me or the straw men, should I have a First Amendment or should these companies be able to violate the whole Safe Harbor Act and all that and then ban conservatives en masse?
[00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:40.374]  Yeah, I don't know anything about your site, man.
[00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:44.242]  The employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[00:00:44.663 --> 00:00:47.328]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:48.530]  It's fine.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.100]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.841]  Alex Jones.

[00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:11.394]  Alex Jones.
[00:01:11.414 --> 00:01:11.654]  Alex Jones.
[00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:11.914]  Alex Jones.
[00:01:11.974 --> 00:01:12.255]  Alex Jones.
[00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:12.635]  Alex Jones.
[00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:13.035]  Alex Jones.

[00:01:16.237 --> 00:01:16.577]  Alex Jones.
[00:01:16.597 --> 00:01:17.198]  Alex Jones
[00:01:17.738 --> 00:01:21.381]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:23.202]  It's time to stop submitting to this charity!
[00:01:23.222 --> 00:01:25.504]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:01:25.804 --> 00:01:27.125]  I heard that on Alex Jones!
[00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:28.946]  InfoWars went even further.
[00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:32.168]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:36.091]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:39.453]  Nobody can dispute the fact that you're a great...
[00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:43.960]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.501]  InfoWars.
[00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:45.501]  InfoWars.
[00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:48.023]  Right now the war is the InfoWars.
[00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:49.084]  You watch InfoWars?
[00:01:49.104 --> 00:01:49.745]  InfoWars!

[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.860]  InfoWars!
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.060]  InfoW
[00:02:15.794 --> 00:02:17.735]  You are receiving this transmission.
[00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:21.418]  You are the resistance.
[00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:32.245]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:36.204 --> 00:02:54.113]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I was already excited we were going to have a good day today and then Trump, out of the blue, finally delivered on one of his big promises to fight back against censorship and is threatening to pull tens of billions of dollars of federal funding from public
[00:02:54.953 --> 00:03:04.160]  Institutions of so-called higher learning, if they continue to resemble North Korean re-education camps or Maoist youth brigade re-education centers.
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.401]  Literally, that's the model they operate on.
[00:03:07.142 --> 00:03:11.645]  They say, I'm not just saying they operate like Maoist Red Guard.
[00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:12.485]  That's the model.
[00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:14.227]  You cannot make it up.
[00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:18.790]  That's the operating system of Antifa, the George Soros meth-head army.
[00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:25.449]  And so, just an hour ago or so, President Trump signed the executive order.
[00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.911]  This is devastating to the globalists.
[00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:29.751]  It is beautiful.
[00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:35.374]  It's going to get challenged, but you can't be a public higher education facility.
[00:03:35.394 --> 00:03:40.477]  We're supposed to have free, open debate of ideas, and they're calling for book burning.
[00:03:40.537 --> 00:03:42.478]  They're banning people coming and speaking.
[00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.860]  I probably should have taken the offer years ago in Cambridge.
[00:03:47.538 --> 00:03:52.668]  And others invited me to go speak at their famous forum and I just I didn't do it.
[00:03:52.688 --> 00:03:56.635]  And there was also another invitation hidden under it that was another
[00:03:57.861 --> 00:03:58.902]  Ploy, if I would have gone.
[00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:01.864]  So I didn't want to meet with that branch of the Illuminati.
[00:04:02.364 --> 00:04:03.665]  This is the Alex Jones Show, folks.
[00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:07.388]  I know it sounds insane, but that's the level and the fight we've gotten to.
[00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:10.330]  But now Jordan Peterson's banned from speaking there.
[00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.131]  And now they're banning his books.
[00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:13.592]  I mean, it's on, folks.
[00:04:13.652 --> 00:04:14.973]  These people mean business.
[00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:19.857]  And the head of YouTube bragged how she banned me last year because she didn't like me.
[00:04:20.137 --> 00:04:21.998]  And now she wants to ban Ben Shapiro.
[00:04:22.018 --> 00:04:23.139]  We played that clip yesterday.
[00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:25.881]  This is unbelievable.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.602]  And then they go to Congress and say, we're not censoring anybody.
[00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:35.047]  And then they're on television and on podcasts and on congressional hearings bragging how they're censoring us.
[00:04:35.527 --> 00:04:37.429]  And Democrats say they want more censorship.
[00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:42.493]  It's just the most flagrant... It'd be like if you're watching me on TV and I say I'm wearing a white shirt.
[00:04:42.513 --> 00:04:43.334]  You're like, no you're not.
[00:04:43.594 --> 00:04:44.855]  You're wearing a black shirt.
[00:04:45.836 --> 00:04:46.997]  This is a white coffee cup.
[00:04:47.317 --> 00:04:48.759]  It says DrudgeReport.com on it.
[00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:50.260]  It's not a black coffee cup.
[00:04:52.093 --> 00:04:54.094]  It doesn't say New York Times on it.
[00:04:54.314 --> 00:04:55.134]  It says Drudge Report.
[00:04:55.354 --> 00:04:56.234]  It's a white coffee cup.
[00:04:56.574 --> 00:04:58.695]  They tell you, though, don't believe your lying eyes.
[00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:01.855]  Oh, I got another big announcement, too, when we come back in 60 seconds.
[00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:07.037]  And now... There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[00:05:07.677 --> 00:05:09.177]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[00:05:09.657 --> 00:05:11.238]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:15.339]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:18.477]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[00:05:18.998 --> 00:05:20.198]  I didn't invent all this.
[00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:26.562]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[00:05:27.122 --> 00:05:29.924]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[00:05:31.004 --> 00:05:34.025]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:36.926]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[00:05:37.247 --> 00:05:38.487]  That sends chills up my spine.
[00:05:38.947 --> 00:05:52.213]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[00:05:52.493 --> 00:05:54.434]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[00:05:55.074 --> 00:05:59.899]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.842]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:14.675]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.407 --> 00:06:25.688]  It's March 22nd, 2019.
[00:06:26.188 --> 00:06:34.872]  We are smack dab in the middle of the emergency 50-hour global transmission.
[00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:38.134]  We'll be live until 10 a.m.
[00:06:38.154 --> 00:06:38.454]  tomorrow.
[00:06:38.894 --> 00:06:40.115]  I'll be back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:41.175 --> 00:06:50.980]  And the name of the emergency broadcast is hashtag stop the bias, save the First Amendment, stop big tech censorship.
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:07:12.005]  And we have been on Trump's tail to make the racketeering, to make the cartels that are bragging on TV and on podcast, the heads of Google, the heads of Twitter, the heads of Facebook, the head of YouTube, that, oh, we're going to censor everybody.
[00:07:12.585 --> 00:07:14.345]  We're going to shut people up.
[00:07:15.566 --> 00:07:19.287]  We don't want our 13-year-old sons, you know, listening to Alex Jones or Ben Shapiro.
[00:07:19.707 --> 00:07:20.607]  These are quotes.
[00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:23.621]  Played them yesterday.
[00:07:24.482 --> 00:07:25.483]  And they go lie to Congress.
[00:07:25.523 --> 00:07:26.423]  Well, Trump just did it.
[00:07:28.765 --> 00:07:32.087]  He's done so much good trying to get us out of these wars, pulling back 90%.
[00:07:33.488 --> 00:07:37.730]  He's gotten thousands of factories back in the country, thousands of companies back.
[00:07:38.611 --> 00:07:40.332]  Major tax cuts that help poor people.
[00:07:40.352 --> 00:07:44.875]  Actually raised taxes on middle class and rich people to try to pay some of the debts.
[00:07:45.936 --> 00:07:47.096]  Very Kennedy-esque.
[00:07:47.977 --> 00:07:48.897]  Got us out of the TPP.
[00:07:50.967 --> 00:07:55.751]  He's going after the private Federal Reserve, trying to secure our border, while all the globalists try to break our border.
[00:07:57.473 --> 00:08:02.718]  Listing the good things are good, but if he doesn't defend free speech, it doesn't matter.
[00:08:02.738 --> 00:08:09.744]  It's like if a submarine had ten bulkheads on it, and you close nine of them, but leave one open, the sub's gonna flood.
[00:08:10.925 --> 00:08:11.626]  Well, guess what?
[00:08:14.246 --> 00:08:23.229]  He had dangled last year that he was going to do a bunch of antitrust actions against the big tech companies, that's already begun, against Facebook.
[00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:34.794]  That was the only action so far, kind of the ganging up on Facebook, which I'm not defending Facebook, but it's nothing compared to Google and Apple and the true human rights abuses.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:57.889]  So then a few days ago, he tweeted out Laura Loomer's hashtag, StopTheBias, and today he signed an executive order to pull tens of billions of dollars from colleges where the arrogant deans and the frothing fascista so-called students and anti-fud professors say, we're not allowing free speech on our campuses.
[00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.491]  These are the places where supposedly the most protected
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.501]  These are the places where speech is absolutism.
[00:09:10.401 --> 00:09:23.144]  But now they've turned it totally on its head, and so the Free Speech Clinic at Georgetown is suing myself and getting ready to sue Google, demanding more censorship, they've announced.
[00:09:24.644 --> 00:09:29.225]  So that's what universities of free speech are now, is systems of destroying free speech.
[00:09:31.786 --> 00:09:36.027]  It'd be like saying a nanny for your baby, their job is strangling your child.
[00:09:36.327 --> 00:09:38.327]  No, the nanny's job is to take care of the child lovingly.
[00:09:38.907 --> 00:09:40.528]  So it's a total inversion of reality.
[00:09:41.128 --> 00:09:54.490]  Big Tech, the failed college professors, dying corporate media, with the Democratic Party, with an acquiescent Republican Party, working in tandem to completely overthrow free speech as we know it.
[00:09:56.411 --> 00:09:57.391]  And they've gone a long way.
[00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:58.711]  They've gotten away with a hell of a lot.
[00:10:00.694 --> 00:10:20.527]  Creating total anti-free speech zones in the colleges and the corporate workplaces and now they're expanding it into every aspect of our lives with millions of tech employees able to dial in and look at your photos, read what you're saying, see what you're reading in live time and put up messages saying you better watch what you're looking at.
[00:10:21.427 --> 00:10:22.528]  It's all happening.
[00:10:23.328 --> 00:10:27.171]  They're just racing like a fish on a line and the reel's going...
[00:10:28.833 --> 00:10:34.618]  And when are we going to plant the hook and try to stop this and reel this thing back in before they break the line?
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.062]  And it's all concerted worldwide.
[00:10:41.744 --> 00:10:48.370]  They're using the tragic events in New Zealand at Christchurch to openly demonize America and our speech as well.
[00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.453]  And the global Islamic groups are calling for an end to free speech.
[00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:51.833]  Wow!
[00:10:51.893 --> 00:10:52.473]  Big surprise!
[00:10:52.714 --> 00:10:53.815]  Islam's not for free speech!
[00:10:54.721 --> 00:11:04.343]  And every time it comes into your country, then when there's a clash with it, because 101, they kill us, if you don't comply to them, it's your fault.
[00:11:05.144 --> 00:11:05.904]  And that's in the news.
[00:11:06.424 --> 00:11:09.285]  So here's the president doing the right thing.
[00:11:09.685 --> 00:11:19.007]  A big, strong salvo right at the heart of the anti-American authoritarianism that would make Mao Zedong blush.
[00:11:19.247 --> 00:11:21.728]  Here's the president just a little while ago at the White House.
[00:11:22.858 --> 00:11:34.202]  To every student and young American here today, don't let anyone stop you from doing what you know is right, from asking questions, from challenging the powerful, or from speaking your mind.
[00:11:34.242 --> 00:11:36.383]  And that's the primary reason we're here right now.
[00:11:36.423 --> 00:11:37.483]  You're going to speak your mind.
[00:11:38.183 --> 00:11:39.024]  You're going to be fair.
[00:11:39.044 --> 00:11:40.104]  You're going to be reasonable.
[00:11:40.164 --> 00:11:41.084]  You're going to do it well.
[00:11:41.385 --> 00:11:42.605]  And you're going to speak your mind.
[00:11:43.765 --> 00:11:45.486]  Never, ever quit.
[00:11:46.346 --> 00:11:47.867]  Never give in.
[00:11:48.723 --> 00:11:50.865]  And never back down.
[00:11:51.445 --> 00:11:55.249]  Keep standing up for your values, for your classmates, and for your country.
[00:11:55.869 --> 00:12:03.496]  And you can be certain that every day of my presidency, we will always support your rights and your freedoms and your future.
[00:12:04.196 --> 00:12:05.878]  Thank you all for being here.
[00:12:05.898 --> 00:12:07.699]  This is a great honor for me.
[00:12:07.719 --> 00:12:09.261]  I've been watching this for too long.
[00:12:09.901 --> 00:12:13.485]  I've been watching things that are unwatchable, and I don't like it.
[00:12:13.945 --> 00:12:15.507]  But we're gonna do something about it.
[00:12:15.547 --> 00:12:19.311]  See, we like to act as opposed to just watching and saying, oh, isn't that a shame?
[00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:20.552]  We don't say that.
[00:12:21.292 --> 00:12:22.093]  We don't say that.
[00:12:26.217 --> 00:12:26.478]  Yes.
[00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:28.520]  I knew I'd bet on the live horse.
[00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:35.969]  And I want to congratulate everybody, everybody for being here.
[00:12:36.049 --> 00:12:43.497]  You have just a tremendous future ahead of you and this will make you a lot of reason to get that point of view across.
[00:12:43.598 --> 00:12:45.059]  And listen to the other point of view.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.462]  Maybe you can be changed and maybe not.
[00:12:47.962 --> 00:12:48.443]  I doubt it.
[00:12:50.762 --> 00:12:51.162]  But maybe.
[00:12:51.482 --> 00:12:52.203]  You never know.
[00:12:52.943 --> 00:12:53.403]  And you know what?
[00:12:53.443 --> 00:12:54.524]  If you can, that's okay.
[00:12:54.944 --> 00:12:56.225]  And you'll change them, too.
[00:12:56.585 --> 00:12:57.786]  You're gonna change them, too.
[00:12:58.426 --> 00:13:00.347]  But ultimately, it brings people together.
[00:13:00.427 --> 00:13:01.808]  So, congratulations.
[00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:02.988]  I'll sign right now.
[00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:04.169]  Thank you all for being here.
[00:13:04.249 --> 00:13:05.470]  Again, it pulls funding.
[00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:14.914]  Some estimates are up to $40 billion of federal money from these so-called colleges that are brainwashing camps.
[00:13:14.934 --> 00:13:16.215]  It's beautiful.
[00:13:18.316 --> 00:13:19.697]  The anti-free speech monsters.
[00:13:21.196 --> 00:13:32.501]  Alright, we've got more of this and some of the students coming up and what they've been through and the incredible persecution, physical assaults, being kicked out of college, having grades taken away, and the professors are so arrogant they admit it all.
[00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:33.871]  They admit it all.
[00:13:34.512 --> 00:13:44.100]  By the way, in all these lawsuits against us, they keep trying to get discovery and ask for my communications, you know, with the President or with non-governmental organizations or with the Pentagon.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.522]  Because they keep going, how is Jones synced with the President?
[00:13:47.863 --> 00:13:53.067]  He launches a free speech, 50-hour broadcast, and then the President suddenly out of the blue acts.
[00:13:54.171 --> 00:13:54.812]  It's spiritual.
[00:13:54.872 --> 00:13:55.732]  It's synced up.
[00:13:55.772 --> 00:14:01.115]  And they keep wondering how I said what Trump would say in his inaugural speech, and then he said exactly what I said.
[00:14:01.135 --> 00:14:04.837]  The New York Times came up shaking with anger, going, how did you know that?
[00:14:05.698 --> 00:14:07.819]  Because they'd been reading my tweets that day, and videos.
[00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:09.100]  And I said, I just knew.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.921]  Because it's a spirit.
[00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:14.660]  It's very, very exciting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:14.841 --> 00:14:16.622]  Okay.
[00:14:16.642 --> 00:14:17.543]  And you're the reason we're here.
[00:14:17.643 --> 00:14:19.044]  We're all synced up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:19.064 --> 00:14:20.705]  50-hour broadcast going.
[00:14:20.965 --> 00:14:23.667]  Joe Rogan is scheduled to be in studio today.
[00:14:23.687 --> 00:14:26.289]  If his plane doesn't get here on time, it'll be taped.
[00:14:26.369 --> 00:14:28.691]  But Joe Rogan is going to be here in just a few hours.
[00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:29.472]  Look forward to that.
[00:14:29.532 --> 00:14:34.456]  He's also planning to be here to just magically work to speak about free speech and how important that is.
[00:14:34.876 --> 00:14:35.737]  That's the synchronicity.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.341]  Talk to him this morning, that's what he wants to get into.
[00:14:38.881 --> 00:14:39.381]  Very interesting.
[00:14:40.282 --> 00:14:41.722]  So we'll talk about it all.
[00:14:42.022 --> 00:14:50.806]  Please don't forget, this is a fundraiser to fight the globalists and win and keep this amazing command base, this outpost, this firebase against the enemy in place.
[00:14:51.327 --> 00:15:00.651]  And we're completely surrounded by the enemy, which is perfect because that lets us target the enemy politically and stay inside their zone so that we get a 360 view of their operations.
[00:15:01.476 --> 00:15:03.356]  It's like sending a probe into the sun or something.
[00:15:03.396 --> 00:15:04.057]  But we're here.
[00:15:04.157 --> 00:15:04.697]  We're doing it.
[00:15:05.377 --> 00:15:06.577]  Free shipping storewide.

[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.841]  The Deep Earth Crystal Source.
[00:15:20.861 --> 00:15:21.761]  We'd sold out for months.
[00:15:22.001 --> 00:15:26.042]  We were able to actually get it again from the original manufacturer at the highest quality.
[00:15:26.242 --> 00:15:26.902]  Original formula.
[00:15:28.772 --> 00:15:29.375]  So it's back.
[00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:31.666]  55% off and free shipping.

[00:15:41.796 --> 00:15:53.906]  A bunch of other big specials on Brain Force Plus, on the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste, 4-5 Club of Silver and Iodine for adults, children, and the amazing mouthwash that nobody else has anything like it.
[00:15:54.406 --> 00:15:56.007]  Such an exciting time to be alive!
[00:15:56.167 --> 00:15:56.447]  Yes!
[00:15:56.888 --> 00:15:58.329]  Trump is coming through!
[00:15:58.349 --> 00:15:58.389]  Ha!
[00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.991]  Oh, I love it!
[00:16:02.977 --> 00:16:06.860]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[00:16:07.621 --> 00:16:11.444]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[00:16:11.864 --> 00:16:18.890]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.032]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[00:16:22.933 --> 00:16:26.416]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:30.711]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[00:16:30.871 --> 00:16:32.412]  We are the power structure.
[00:16:32.913 --> 00:16:33.953]  We are the inventors.
[00:16:34.534 --> 00:16:35.574]  We are the trailblazers.
[00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:39.157]  And the globalists understand that.
[00:16:39.697 --> 00:16:45.661]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:50.624]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[00:16:51.650 --> 00:17:00.642]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at m4store.com.
[00:17:00.782 --> 00:17:02.184]  Something everybody should take advantage of.
[00:17:04.026 --> 00:17:05.408]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[00:17:05.468 --> 00:17:07.250]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:07.771]  It is!
[00:17:07.971 --> 00:17:09.553]  But if you took it with fish oil...
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.362]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[00:17:12.842 --> 00:17:14.084]  The fish oil's better than it.
[00:17:14.184 --> 00:17:15.926]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:17:16.006 --> 00:17:18.328]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:17:18.488 --> 00:17:20.050]  Brain, body, heart.
[00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.511]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[00:17:21.571 --> 00:17:22.813]  You've got the children's.
[00:17:22.953 --> 00:17:23.914]  You've got the adults.
[00:17:24.054 --> 00:17:24.975]  You've got the krill oil.
[00:17:25.075 --> 00:17:28.438]  If you're gonna get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[00:17:28.458 --> 00:17:30.821]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[00:17:31.181 --> 00:17:33.062]  It'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry.
[00:17:33.162 --> 00:17:34.142]  You want something like this?
[00:17:34.222 --> 00:17:35.103]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:17:35.203 --> 00:17:37.063]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:17:37.123 --> 00:17:38.264]  It's so good, in my view.
[00:17:38.344 --> 00:17:40.545]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:17:40.645 --> 00:17:43.266]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:17:43.386 --> 00:17:45.006]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:17:46.767 --> 00:17:51.329]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:17:54.284 --> 00:18:00.087]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:18:00.187 --> 00:18:11.654]  I just can't do it!

[00:20:06.516 --> 00:20:09.178]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:23.035 --> 00:20:29.381]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:29.421 --> 00:20:41.253]  So, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:20:48.894 --> 00:20:51.577]  If you go to Infowars.com, you see the headline.
[00:20:52.217 --> 00:21:00.625]  Finally, Trump strikes back against leftist censorship in the United States.
[00:21:03.047 --> 00:21:03.768]  Think about that.
[00:21:05.069 --> 00:21:06.290]  That's exactly where you hit him.
[00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:07.472]  You want to hit George Soros?
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:18.405]  Remember what Lou Dobbs said back in December, when we had giant caravans smashing into the United States.
[00:21:18.465 --> 00:21:19.346]  Tens of thousands of people.
[00:21:19.366 --> 00:21:20.606]  They'd overrun the Mexicans.
[00:21:21.007 --> 00:21:23.368]  They had smuggled, kidnapped kids, drugs.
[00:21:24.248 --> 00:21:25.629]  First they said there is no caravan.
[00:21:25.649 --> 00:21:27.310]  Then they said, oh, they're all women and children.
[00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:27.730]  Let them in.
[00:21:28.911 --> 00:21:31.072]  And then they all had USAID bags.
[00:21:31.112 --> 00:21:35.775]  That's where our tax money goes to the State Department, to the UN, and then to George Soros.
[00:21:35.815 --> 00:21:36.755]  He never spends his own money.
[00:21:36.775 --> 00:21:38.136]  In fact, he takes a cut of it.
[00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:42.733]  And then Lou Dobbs had Judicial Watch on with the documents.
[00:21:43.293 --> 00:21:44.254]  They had a Judicial Watch.
[00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:48.875]  And it was Soros getting hundreds of millions of dollars the last few years.
[00:21:49.595 --> 00:21:56.978]  And he's in Visa commercials getting Visa to give the invaders multi-thousand dollar cards with no name on them.
[00:21:56.998 --> 00:21:57.558]  They just work.
[00:21:59.224 --> 00:22:11.529]  And the media said it was a conspiracy theory and didn't exist, even though it's official funding, even though it was NBC News, the Associated Press, praising George Soros for funding the migrants with our money.
[00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:17.131]  But then separately, when Judicial Watch gets the documents that it's worse than we knew, it doesn't exist.
[00:22:19.112 --> 00:22:21.012]  And Fox reprimanded Lou Dobbs.
[00:22:22.233 --> 00:22:24.354]  Remember, suddenly he wasn't on for a couple days.
[00:22:24.654 --> 00:22:25.334]  They suspended him.
[00:22:26.869 --> 00:22:33.372]  And Fox announced that the head of Judicial Watch, highly respected, was never to be on Fox News again.
[00:22:35.233 --> 00:22:42.936]  Because he brought out the steaks, the holy water, the garlic, high noon.
[00:22:46.538 --> 00:22:47.118]  Think about that.
[00:22:48.038 --> 00:22:48.899]  There's the LA Times.
[00:22:48.959 --> 00:22:51.280]  Fox bans Lou Dobbs tonight, guest over George Soros.
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.041]  Comment, you're saying, what's it have to do with Trump finally coming through on First Amendment?
[00:22:55.273 --> 00:23:04.137]  He's going to cut the tens of billions of dollars from any public college that bans speech and restricts it.
[00:23:05.197 --> 00:23:06.578]  Of course you should take their money.
[00:23:06.858 --> 00:23:08.398]  These are criminal organizations.
[00:23:08.898 --> 00:23:12.680]  Let them learn why they're publicly funded and why we believe in higher education.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:14.961]  They have inverted higher education.
[00:23:14.981 --> 00:23:16.141]  They are monsters!
[00:23:18.462 --> 00:23:22.524]  And they've gotten so arrogant, the head of YouTube went on one of the biggest podcasts
[00:23:24.798 --> 00:23:34.404]  At the Lesbians in Tech Convention in San Francisco, and they're all giggling and laughing and saying, we took Alex Jones off, we want Ben Shapiro off.
[00:23:34.444 --> 00:23:35.784]  And she goes, well I'm trying.
[00:23:36.065 --> 00:23:37.726]  I agree, we want him off.
[00:23:38.106 --> 00:23:40.287]  Ben Shapiro's a neocon milquetoast.
[00:23:40.647 --> 00:23:41.628]  He makes a lot of good points.
[00:23:41.908 --> 00:23:46.791]  I agree with about 80% of what he says, but my God, he's the darling of the neocons.
[00:23:47.071 --> 00:23:48.232]  Even a neocon
[00:23:49.525 --> 00:23:53.366]  Apprentice, the darling golden boy, is not good enough.
[00:23:53.586 --> 00:23:54.867]  They want it all gone!
[00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:56.467]  And why?
[00:23:56.487 --> 00:23:58.628]  Because she doesn't like her son having access to it.
[00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:09.312]  They're in public saying they want to control everything.
[00:24:11.332 --> 00:24:12.713]  And so you cut the money.
[00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:18.875]  George Soros, conservatively,
[00:24:20.905 --> 00:24:28.692]  Has gotten about, from the numbers we've seen, about $150 billion from the State Department in the last 30 years.
[00:24:30.414 --> 00:24:31.575]  And I'll give Soros this.
[00:24:33.336 --> 00:24:37.480]  He's an intelligence operative of the highest levels, above CIA, all that.
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:38.601]  He worked for the U.S.
[00:24:38.621 --> 00:24:38.901]  government.
[00:24:39.161 --> 00:24:41.383]  George Soros helped take down the USSR.
[00:24:42.084 --> 00:24:43.085]  I know people that worked with him.
[00:24:44.383 --> 00:24:50.764]  The point is, he's using all that now on us, like America's the USSR, and like Mom and Apple Pie is, and it isn't.
[00:24:52.005 --> 00:25:00.586]  We're facing the CIA, the NSA, the criminal elements of it, that are rolling out this civil emergency that Brett Hume talked about last week.
[00:25:00.986 --> 00:25:05.467]  He said the Democrats declared a secret emergency, and there's an emergency in the government against Trump.
[00:25:06.007 --> 00:25:06.687]  That's the truth!
[00:25:07.288 --> 00:25:11.809]  Now I know you heard that here years ago because it's in the executive orders of Obama, but that's a big deal.
[00:25:12.349 --> 00:25:13.909]  Cut the funding, Mr. President.
[00:25:15.185 --> 00:25:17.486]  Of the Countering Foreign Intelligence and Disinformation Act.
[00:25:17.786 --> 00:25:20.086]  It doesn't counter foreign intelligence and disinformation.
[00:25:20.146 --> 00:25:21.427]  It targets you!
[00:25:22.007 --> 00:25:22.927]  It targets me!
[00:25:23.407 --> 00:25:23.927]  Publicly!
[00:25:24.207 --> 00:25:25.068]  In the damn hearings!
[00:25:26.908 --> 00:25:28.148]  Saying I'm anti-American.
[00:25:28.388 --> 00:25:35.970]  No, I'm not Google helping build autonomous AI hunter-killer robots and drones and telling the Pentagon go fly a kite.
[00:25:37.811 --> 00:25:39.891]  I'm an American, period, and everybody knows it.
[00:25:40.151 --> 00:25:40.792]  You're the traitors.
[00:25:41.292 --> 00:25:42.172]  And it's all gonna come out.
[00:25:45.796 --> 00:25:47.037]  George Soros wants to work with the U.N.
[00:25:47.097 --> 00:25:50.839]  and the State Department to crush our borders, overwhelm our judges and courts and jails.
[00:25:52.459 --> 00:25:53.180]  Cut his funding!
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.320]  Jerking!
[00:25:55.141 --> 00:25:58.343]  Because when you see when they freak out, you know what hurts them.
[00:25:58.603 --> 00:25:59.363]  Cutting their funding?
[00:25:59.903 --> 00:26:01.064]  How they're using our money against us?
[00:26:02.085 --> 00:26:03.785]  Any type of criticism of pedophilia?
[00:26:04.226 --> 00:26:05.486]  And the left grooming your kids?
[00:26:05.526 --> 00:26:06.827]  That's their big sacrament?
[00:26:07.187 --> 00:26:08.308]  That's their biggest no-no?
[00:26:08.668 --> 00:26:09.668]  You don't talk about that.
[00:26:10.189 --> 00:26:10.689]  No, no, no.
[00:26:10.729 --> 00:26:11.649]  That's their religion.
[00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.090]  Is screwing your kids up.
[00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:14.211]  Vampiric.
[00:26:15.558 --> 00:26:16.362]  True vampirism.
[00:26:16.764 --> 00:26:17.206]  Spiritual.
[00:26:17.568 --> 00:26:17.830]  Energy.
[00:26:21.554 --> 00:26:25.598]  And they don't like open borders and the Islamic invasion being taken over.
[00:26:25.898 --> 00:26:31.663]  Because they're going to bring the Muslims in, it's not compatible with the West, and then we'll have to get rid of free speech and everything to be compatible for them.
[00:26:31.703 --> 00:26:40.631]  And now the global Islamic councils and all of them have come out and said, get rid of free speech in the West, and the police are putting hijabs on in Europe and New Zealand in solidarity.
[00:26:40.951 --> 00:26:45.315]  Hey, will the Muslims go put crosses on in solidarity the next time a church gets blown up?
[00:26:48.459 --> 00:26:54.425]  They've had NBC News, Media Matters, Southern Primary Law Center, all of them come out and say Jones is a liar.
[00:26:56.046 --> 00:27:00.590]  He says Muslims target churches on Easter and Palm Sunday.
[00:27:00.971 --> 00:27:01.171]  What?
[00:27:01.931 --> 00:27:08.197]  Hundreds of churches have been blown up the last few years in Egypt alone on Easter, Christmas, and Palm Sunday.
[00:27:08.958 --> 00:27:10.619]  It's like Jones claims that
[00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:13.572]  In Indianapolis, they have a race called the 500.
[00:27:14.873 --> 00:27:18.896]  Jones claims the New England Patriots are based in New England and have won six Super Bowls.
[00:27:21.017 --> 00:27:23.139]  Jones claims, again, 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:27:23.379 --> 00:27:28.423]  And they just state like... Jones wrongly claims there's only two genders.
[00:27:32.606 --> 00:27:33.787]  Jones claims water's wet.
[00:27:33.887 --> 00:27:36.970]  Again, it's an assault on reality.
[00:27:40.168 --> 00:27:41.568]  And so I feel bad for these Muslims.
[00:27:43.429 --> 00:27:50.191]  Even though local newspapers reported that there was radicalization of people that ended up getting captured and killed in Syria from that mosque.
[00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:54.672]  Still, it's a terrible thing that happened to those poor people.
[00:27:55.272 --> 00:27:55.912]  But you know what?
[00:27:56.012 --> 00:27:57.772]  Let's humanize some Christians.
[00:27:58.493 --> 00:28:07.575]  Because Christians are being driven out of their lands all over the world and the Islamic caliphate is expanding like a lymph node cancer.
[00:28:09.818 --> 00:28:11.018]  Racing throughout the body!
[00:28:12.459 --> 00:28:14.660]  And the biggest killer of Muslims is other Muslims!
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.661]  We need a reparation!
[00:28:18.381 --> 00:28:19.842]  A reformation in Islam!
[00:28:23.623 --> 00:28:28.025]  We need to come out of this mass Stockholm Syndrome!
[00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:34.664]  We need to understand the reality of how we're being conditioned, and they're trying to break our will.
[00:28:34.704 --> 00:28:35.544]  They think we're stupid.
[00:28:35.584 --> 00:28:36.405]  They think we're saps.
[00:28:36.665 --> 00:28:37.666]  They think we're followers.
[00:28:37.746 --> 00:28:39.968]  And there are a lot of people that are, but a bunch of us aren't!
[00:28:41.709 --> 00:28:42.630]  And it's not gonna work.
[00:28:44.011 --> 00:28:54.639]  In the middle of the 50-hour global transmission to save the First Amendment, to stop big tech censorship, and now Trump is fired right at the heart of the spider's nest of censorship.
[00:28:55.419 --> 00:28:57.221]  The once great universities now dens.
[00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:11.916]  There's been a paradox or a contradiction on the surface that many have noted in the last hundred years.
[00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:19.862]  Historians are confused by the fact that powerful British and European and U.S.
[00:29:20.102 --> 00:29:26.247]  robber barons of the 19th and 20th century almost to a man
[00:29:27.535 --> 00:29:29.638]  Funded Socialism and Communism.
[00:29:30.379 --> 00:29:31.701]  People say that that doesn't make sense.
[00:29:32.442 --> 00:29:39.712]  But Carol Quigley, the head of Georgetown Political Science, Bill Clinton's mentor back in the 1960s, wrote Tragedy and Hope.
[00:29:41.394 --> 00:29:42.295]  And in the 1100 page blueprint,
[00:29:44.935 --> 00:29:50.038]  He explains that we want fascism, we want communism, we want socialism, we want command and control.
[00:29:50.739 --> 00:29:55.082]  But our favorite system is socialism, because it domesticates the people.
[00:29:55.482 --> 00:29:59.064]  But we want to have the illusion of left and right, we want to control both parties.
[00:30:00.245 --> 00:30:05.429]  So that people think they're having change, but really, they move in the same direction, towards vertical integration.
[00:30:05.969 --> 00:30:11.853]  So you have the big billionaires, the people controlling trillion dollar companies like Tim Cook at Apple and others,
[00:30:13.226 --> 00:30:27.437]  Who literally run the equivalent of slave factories in China, who help round up political dissidents, but they're everywhere lecturing you about Black Lives Matter and about how Trump hates Muslims and how altruistic and loving they are.
[00:30:28.238 --> 00:30:32.401]  Because if you look into what they pay in taxes, it's almost zero.
[00:30:32.862 --> 00:30:40.268]  And it's all the big tech companies have set it up with offshore accounts and other systems where they legally pay almost no tax.
[00:30:41.368 --> 00:30:48.611]  And the very same people lecture you and I, how if you're making $100,000 a year, you're rich and you're not paying enough money.
[00:30:48.631 --> 00:30:51.032]  If you're making $200,000 a year, you're in the 1%.
[00:30:51.192 --> 00:30:53.793]  And you're guilty and you're bad.
[00:30:55.333 --> 00:30:59.315]  No, the globalists are in the .0000000042, depending on the analysis you do.
[00:30:59.335 --> 00:31:04.096]  That tiny percentage of a percentage controls over half wealth.
[00:31:09.699 --> 00:31:11.940]  And they're maneuvering things towards a monopoly.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.581]  They want to get rid of middle classes.
[00:31:13.601 --> 00:31:23.707]  They want to get rid of real free market systems that threaten them with innovation, and new companies, and new ideas, and new leaders, and new savants that come along.
[00:31:24.704 --> 00:31:32.206]  So they're creating a classical system, a two-tiered system, where the elite are on top, the people are on the bottom, and there's no middle class.
[00:31:32.806 --> 00:31:42.969]  That's the globalist aim, selling you on austerity, selling you on being poor, telling you your carbon footprint's evil, but AOC and the rest of them fly around on private jets and wear $3,000-plus outfits.
[00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.971]  All they tell us is capitalism is a failure.
[00:31:47.011 --> 00:31:48.772]  It isn't capitalism that's a failure.
[00:31:49.252 --> 00:31:59.237]  It's crony capitalism, using socialism and communism to control us, that is working beautifully for this world fascist system they've set up.
[00:31:59.758 --> 00:32:07.382]  It's corporate fascism using crony capitalism to dodge the taxes, to be above the law, diplomatic immunity, dominating humanity.
[00:32:07.922 --> 00:32:09.723]  And that's why they demonize info wars.
[00:32:10.243 --> 00:32:13.225]  If you read the Clinton Foundation documents, the Judicial Watch sued and died.
[00:32:15.146 --> 00:32:21.652]  They're talking in the early 90s about we can't let right-wingers or nationalists ever create their own economy.
[00:32:21.993 --> 00:32:27.098]  If they sell a book, or have a magazine, or open a company, we've got to say it's evil and shut it down.

[00:33:26.422 --> 00:33:29.943]  You keep sayin' you got somethin' for me.
[00:33:32.204 --> 00:33:35.465]  Somethin' you call love, but confess.
[00:33:38.086 --> 00:33:41.488]  You've been a messin' where you shouldn't have been a messin'.

[00:33:55.562 --> 00:34:03.106]  One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you.
[00:34:06.048 --> 00:34:09.530]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I have been really upset at Trump.
[00:34:14.702 --> 00:34:20.635]  Because we see massive concerted censorship against basically anybody who is an establishment now.
[00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:47.492]  And they're now banning books, and they're now on Amazon, and in New Zealand, Jordan Peterson books, and they're... Again, had the head of YouTube on a huge podcast in front of a huge crowd of people at the Lesbians in Tech Conference in San Francisco two days ago, and the head of YouTube said, yeah, we banned Alex Jones because we don't like him, because our kids are listening to him, and now we're gonna try to ban Ben Shapiro.
[00:34:48.713 --> 00:34:49.414]  There's no end!
[00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:50.675]  Cambridge had
[00:34:52.128 --> 00:34:53.329]  Jordan Peterson coming to speak.
[00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:55.031]  Canceled it!
[00:34:58.554 --> 00:35:01.677]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, you can go to the store and buy a Mein Kampf.
[00:35:01.737 --> 00:35:02.458]  Hitler wrote that.
[00:35:02.798 --> 00:35:03.779]  And you should be able to buy it.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.902]  You should be able to read what people say.
[00:35:07.022 --> 00:35:08.143]  Good people and bad people.
[00:35:09.264 --> 00:35:10.666]  Hitler, obviously, really bad.
[00:35:13.188 --> 00:35:15.911]  And I wanted to get Clyde Lewis on, who knows one of the biggest
[00:35:16.809 --> 00:35:18.610]  Radio shows in the country, it's definitely in the top 10.
[00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:22.911]  That's ground zero on the premier radio networks.
[00:35:22.931 --> 00:35:25.652]  It comes on right before George Noria was on with us yesterday.
[00:35:25.672 --> 00:35:31.794]  And I wanted to get his take on this, because I would call Clyde, you can tell me if I'm wrong, a classical liberal.
[00:35:31.814 --> 00:35:38.236]  In the Thomas Jefferson vein, the liberals we all liked at the universities that were pro-free speech or on radio.
[00:35:38.276 --> 00:35:39.596]  Everybody knows that's what America is.
[00:35:40.036 --> 00:35:41.057]  It's the soul of the country.
[00:35:42.877 --> 00:35:45.278]  I would call myself a classical liberal, but these terms don't mean anything.
[00:35:46.755 --> 00:35:53.200]  Because now it's just corporate fascists masquerading as liberals working with Republican establishment people for the censorship.
[00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.883]  And I love now how a lot of these big neocons that were for censorship, they're going to get censored.
[00:35:57.083 --> 00:36:02.027]  And the way it always works is even if they get down to just Democrats or liberals, they're going to start censoring each other.
[00:36:02.247 --> 00:36:03.648]  They're all going to want that top slot.
[00:36:04.509 --> 00:36:08.312]  They're all going to hate whoever's got the biggest podcast, the biggest radio show.
[00:36:08.692 --> 00:36:09.773]  Pootie Pie's not political.
[00:36:10.033 --> 00:36:12.235]  They're making him political because he has billions of viewers.
[00:36:12.475 --> 00:36:13.175]  Biggest thing in the world.
[00:36:13.576 --> 00:36:16.438]  The biggest serious show out there, you can't deny it, is Joe Rogan.
[00:36:17.932 --> 00:36:22.257]  And now they're trying to call him a white supremacist, even though he's pretty liberal, even in the modern sense.
[00:36:22.818 --> 00:36:23.419]  Not leftist.
[00:36:25.061 --> 00:36:27.684]  They're trying to say, hey, you're a white supremacist, have us on your show.
[00:36:28.425 --> 00:36:31.709]  That's where this is going, is terrorizing people.
[00:36:31.749 --> 00:36:32.530]  It never stops.
[00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.914]  And I was just on with Clyde Lewis on his syndicated show.
[00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:37.795]  I don't
[00:36:54.955 --> 00:36:55.315]  Public.
[00:36:55.596 --> 00:37:03.722]  You're not going to get federal funding if you just outright say, we're not going to have this speaker, we're not going to have that speaker, tell students they can't have certain speech.
[00:37:03.822 --> 00:37:05.063]  I mean, this is getting scary.
[00:37:05.364 --> 00:37:09.987]  So, Clyde Lewis of GroundZeroMedia.org, great to have you back, my friend.
[00:37:10.128 --> 00:37:10.908]  Things are getting crazy.
[00:37:10.948 --> 00:37:12.329]  What's your take on all this?
[00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.513]  Well, I did a show, and thank you, Alex, for having me on your show today.
[00:37:16.693 --> 00:37:20.056]  I did a show a while back where I was talking about there was a study that was
[00:37:20.954 --> 00:37:26.926]  I can't remember the university, but there was a study in the 1950s where social scientists were saying something to the effect that
[00:37:27.848 --> 00:37:45.540]  If any of its parties, a two-party system, if the two-party system decides that they don't want alternative views being expressed within the parties, then the parties would actually dovetail into something that would be, you know, we would see it dovetail into a lot of extremes.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.241]  We would see extremes within the parties.
[00:37:48.021 --> 00:37:53.625]  And I think we're seeing this now, where if they are going to censor alternative views, even views that sound outrageous,
[00:37:54.461 --> 00:37:57.824]  Uh, what we're going to be seeing is we're going to see a fragmenting of the parties.
[00:37:57.844 --> 00:38:11.293]  We're going to see, you know, because there are, I've noticed that, you know, when you have, uh, like, for example, Ocasio-Cortez, who is, uh, you know, screaming socialism and is saying that we should, you know, go with this new Green Deal.
[00:38:11.313 --> 00:38:15.877]  There are a lot of, uh, you know, Democrats that have said to themselves, well, I'm not, I didn't sign up for this.
[00:38:16.597 --> 00:38:17.198]  I don't know.
[00:38:31.463 --> 00:38:39.288]  It's because we get the extremes going on and, you know, people, like you say, you call me a classical liberal in a Jeffersonian sense.
[00:38:39.788 --> 00:38:51.716]  Well, you know, I kind of see myself as a fiscal, you know, Reagan type of Republican, but I'm also, like you say, a classical liberal in the sense that I'm socially liberal in a lot of respects.
[00:38:52.476 --> 00:38:56.557]  I keep myself in that position because I don't want to find myself leaning to the extremes.
[00:38:56.637 --> 00:38:58.478]  We are in extremes right now.
[00:38:58.618 --> 00:38:59.238]  Well, exactly.
[00:38:59.258 --> 00:39:00.138]  I mean, just throw this in.
[00:39:00.519 --> 00:39:02.499]  I'm socially liberal in Live and Let Live.
[00:39:03.279 --> 00:39:09.641]  And then the media goes, Alex Jones is against gay people and transgenders because he doesn't want them, you know, teaching five-year-olds.
[00:39:10.182 --> 00:39:12.122]  No, I don't care if you're heterosexual, whatever you are.
[00:39:12.482 --> 00:39:13.422]  Leave kids alone.
[00:39:13.462 --> 00:39:15.463]  I'm not against groups that are adults.
[00:39:15.563 --> 00:39:16.443]  Just leave kids alone.
[00:39:16.663 --> 00:39:18.004]  I don't care who you are.
[00:39:18.709 --> 00:39:28.035]  I'm saying, why don't we, okay, I had a person once call my program and this woman was telling me that she was a little upset of the fact that a drag queen was going to read to the kids in a library.
[00:39:28.596 --> 00:39:36.441]  And I said to her, I said, well, why don't you ask some of your gay friends or somebody that's gay, how they feel about that?
[00:39:37.201 --> 00:39:39.603]  What happens is the media focuses on the extremists.
[00:39:39.643 --> 00:39:43.746]  They don't focus on the, I mean, I have a neighbor who's gay and I told him about this.
[00:39:43.806 --> 00:39:45.047]  He said, it's just not right.
[00:39:45.087 --> 00:39:48.389]  You shouldn't have a drag queen in the library reading to five-year-olds.
[00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:50.612]  And I agreed with him.
[00:39:50.692 --> 00:39:51.993]  I said, this isn't cool.
[00:39:52.014 --> 00:39:52.734]  This isn't awesome.
[00:39:53.596 --> 00:39:59.043]  Oh, they had Desmond is Amazing last year to show up at a gay bar and dance for people.
[00:39:59.684 --> 00:40:01.987]  It was reported that half the people left.
[00:40:03.853 --> 00:40:10.978]  See, the thing is, is that this type of stuff, there are a lot of gay Americans that distance themselves from this, the sexualizing of children.
[00:40:11.358 --> 00:40:15.562]  I mean, they were most definitely against NAMBLA at one time.
[00:40:15.602 --> 00:40:17.663]  I don't know what the positions are now.
[00:40:17.743 --> 00:40:22.127]  I mean, I don't sit and talk about this with my gay friends and my gay associates.
[00:40:22.167 --> 00:40:24.248]  I just don't find it necessary to talk about it.
[00:40:24.268 --> 00:40:27.351]  But remember this, when you have a Luciferian system that's in dry dock,
[00:40:27.811 --> 00:40:30.832]  You have it eliminate any chance of real choice.
[00:40:30.852 --> 00:40:33.053]  You have extremists basically taking over.
[00:40:33.414 --> 00:40:35.274]  You're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.
[00:40:35.434 --> 00:40:41.657]  And you then find yourself rationalizing your lack of choice by claiming that you acted on what you felt was the lesser of two evils.
[00:40:42.097 --> 00:40:43.558]  And that is what pathocracy is.
[00:40:43.598 --> 00:40:48.981]  When you start saying to yourself, oh well, I'll just take the lesser of two evils, you're saying, well, I accept evil.
[00:40:49.241 --> 00:40:49.801]  That's okay.
[00:40:50.621 --> 00:40:52.282]  If it's lesser, it won't bother me that much.
[00:40:52.322 --> 00:40:54.383]  But it piles on itself.
[00:40:54.443 --> 00:40:55.323]  I mean, you allow
[00:40:56.544 --> 00:40:57.224]  I think so.
[00:41:14.855 --> 00:41:18.038]  If I say something against the party, then I'm a jerk!
[00:41:18.318 --> 00:41:25.726]  But no, if there's any kind of extremism going on, it would be wise for you to say, I can't handle the extremism here.
[00:41:26.006 --> 00:41:30.891]  We need to kind of focus on keeping ourselves aligned with what is right for America.
[00:41:31.551 --> 00:41:34.673]  And I mean, it's a survival mechanism where people do this.
[00:41:35.074 --> 00:41:36.835]  It's in response to trauma and abuse.
[00:41:36.875 --> 00:41:39.977]  When people feel traumatized and abused, they become chameleons.
[00:41:40.357 --> 00:41:47.542]  And so we say, well, our system isn't perfect, but, you know, there's punishment and reward involved here.
[00:41:47.562 --> 00:41:52.565]  I know we're always told the reward is coming and the reward doesn't come, but we still act as though the reward is happening.
[00:41:52.605 --> 00:41:58.769]  So the question is, what happens when you get the reward or the reward is no longer given?
[00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.211]  We're jumping through hoops like trained dogs.
[00:42:02.171 --> 00:42:08.733]  And so everybody who's extreme will get the limelight and you'll think that the whole world thinks like this, but they don't think like this at all.
[00:42:08.913 --> 00:42:13.455]  Clyde, you're right and you said something really deep there that I always want to articulate, but you just said it perfectly.
[00:42:13.995 --> 00:42:17.736]  People buy the lottery ticket for the dream of the money, not even the money.
[00:42:17.776 --> 00:42:26.319]  Everybody knows that, but like AOC and offering, you know, free stuff five times the entire gross domestic product, it's totally insane.
[00:42:26.339 --> 00:42:27.099]  It doesn't exist.
[00:42:27.859 --> 00:42:32.581]  But people like that idea that it's just all the light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:42:32.621 --> 00:42:34.882]  They just buy into the Froot Loop behavior.
[00:42:34.922 --> 00:42:35.102]  Right.
[00:42:35.622 --> 00:42:39.244]  I was learning, I've been learning a lot about how I feel regarding the president.
[00:42:39.304 --> 00:42:42.405]  And I remember when I first, I remember when Obama first became president.
[00:42:42.425 --> 00:42:47.127]  I said, well, he's my president, so I have to basically support him and see how he does.
[00:42:47.147 --> 00:42:48.708]  Then we started screwing up, I was thinking.
[00:42:49.188 --> 00:42:51.089]  Yeah, okay, well that happens all the time.
[00:42:51.129 --> 00:42:54.811]  Now with Trump, I'm getting the feeling that Donald Trump is the dream.
[00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:58.954]  The only thing is, the dream has not been completely realized.
[00:42:59.034 --> 00:42:59.954]  Stay there, Clyde Lewis.
[00:42:59.974 --> 00:43:00.555]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:05.932]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:12.196]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:43:12.616 --> 00:43:18.499]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:43:18.799 --> 00:43:21.441]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:43:21.721 --> 00:43:29.225]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:43:29.245 --> 00:43:37.449]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[00:43:38.049 --> 00:43:42.311]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[00:43:43.166 --> 00:43:46.788]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:43:46.988 --> 00:43:52.951]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[00:43:53.911 --> 00:44:02.796]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[00:44:03.316 --> 00:44:07.498]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[00:44:07.538 --> 00:44:09.299]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:12.195]  So the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[00:44:12.215 --> 00:44:13.499]  It was the last run.
[00:44:13.519 --> 00:44:14.462]  It's been sold out for two months.
[00:44:15.558 --> 00:44:16.439]  How is X2 back?
[00:44:16.919 --> 00:44:20.522]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[00:44:21.002 --> 00:44:24.065]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get any more.
[00:44:24.665 --> 00:44:34.713]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep-earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[00:44:34.773 --> 00:44:38.697]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[00:44:39.117 --> 00:44:40.258]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[00:44:40.678 --> 00:44:45.021]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[00:44:45.462 --> 00:44:47.263]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:48.985]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[00:44:49.505 --> 00:44:51.787]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[00:44:52.247 --> 00:44:54.589]  I want like a 4.9 star on power reviews.
[00:44:55.209 --> 00:44:58.712]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[00:44:59.533 --> 00:45:01.995]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[00:45:03.032 --> 00:45:05.595]  ...is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[00:45:05.816 --> 00:45:18.151]  So from our brain waves, to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[00:45:18.672 --> 00:45:21.073]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[00:45:21.754 --> 00:45:22.894]  So, iodine is amazing.
[00:45:22.934 --> 00:45:23.494]  It's important.
[00:45:23.514 --> 00:45:25.735]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[00:45:25.815 --> 00:45:26.336]  They'll hurt you.
[00:45:26.716 --> 00:45:27.396]  This is pure.
[00:45:27.696 --> 00:45:28.377]  This is clean.
[00:45:28.737 --> 00:45:29.517]  This is amazing.
[00:45:29.837 --> 00:45:32.499]  And it funds the InfoWars, a 360 win.
[00:45:32.519 --> 00:45:36.801]  So, X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[00:45:37.161 --> 00:45:41.883]  X2 original from the very first original manufacturer.
[00:45:42.303 --> 00:45:46.925]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or AAA253.
[00:45:48.507 --> 00:45:50.650]  3139.
[00:45:48.707 --> 00:45:50.650]  As I said, get your pre-orders in.
[00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:51.811]  A week, week and a half.
[00:45:52.091 --> 00:45:53.233]  It's being labeled right now.
[00:45:53.253 --> 00:45:54.034]  It's already been bottled.
[00:45:54.355 --> 00:46:00.863]  And we are going to have it for you, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWars4.com and InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:46:00.903 --> 00:46:01.885]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:46:12.003 --> 00:46:20.406]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:46:20.987 --> 00:46:30.850]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:46:31.091 --> 00:46:39.614]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:46:40.503 --> 00:46:41.424]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:46:41.784 --> 00:46:42.845]  You must experience it.
[00:46:42.965 --> 00:46:44.866]  It is a total game changer.
[00:46:44.946 --> 00:46:49.290]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you like.
[00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.411]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[00:46:51.472 --> 00:46:52.472]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:46:52.953 --> 00:46:59.118]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:46:59.638 --> 00:47:01.419]  Turbo Force at m4slive.com.
[00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:09.686]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.501 --> 00:47:29.424]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:47:29.904 --> 00:47:31.265]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:31.305 --> 00:47:44.274]  Well, we're in the middle of a 50-hour global broadcast.
[00:47:45.955 --> 00:47:47.977]  We've got every day
[00:47:50.362 --> 00:47:54.484]  Ten hours of live broadcasting on AM and FM and TV stations.
[00:47:55.025 --> 00:48:03.849]  Boy, just during the break, I walked back there in the Phillip Relations area, and there were four or five new radio stations, but there were a couple of new big TV stations.
[00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:08.692]  And I'm going to be announcing it next week, but a couple of them are like the big stations in big cities.
[00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:12.674]  All the stations are precious, but a lot of exciting things happening.
[00:48:13.395 --> 00:48:16.877]  That's why the Globals are working around the clock to shut us down, misrepresenting who we are.
[00:48:17.714 --> 00:48:19.515]  Trying to sue us into oblivion, Rel Rodas.
[00:48:20.456 --> 00:48:22.397]  But God keeps coming through, and you keep coming through.
[00:48:23.278 --> 00:48:27.540]  We have the Save the First Amendment massive specials, the biggest we've ever done.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.123]  I mean, they match the specials from Christmas that were our biggest ever.
[00:48:32.524 --> 00:48:39.208]  And then with this new deal, where for an hour each day, one of the items that's 50% off is 55 to 60% off.
[00:48:39.268 --> 00:48:45.232]  It's a little bit bigger discount with double Patriot points on your next order with your profile in FullerStore.com.
[00:48:46.559 --> 00:48:51.283]  Instead of getting $0.05 on the next dollar, for every dollar you spend, you get $0.05 on the next purchase.
[00:48:51.643 --> 00:48:52.223]  You get $0.10.
[00:48:54.085 --> 00:49:01.390]  You add to that signing up for auto-ship on things like Wake Up America Coffee, or the fish oil, or the protein bars, or the Super Bowl toothpaste.
[00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:04.292]  You can do it every 15 days, every month, every two months, every three months.
[00:49:04.633 --> 00:49:05.793]  You just set when you want it.
[00:49:06.114 --> 00:49:07.054]  It auto-ships to you.
[00:49:07.335 --> 00:49:08.455]  You get an additional 10% off.
[00:49:08.475 --> 00:49:12.418]  And you can just do one click any time and cancel the auto-ship.
[00:49:12.939 --> 00:49:15.661]  So everybody should sign up for auto-ship on the Staples.
[00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:21.062]  And you get great toothpaste, you get great coffee, you get great fish oil, you get amazing protein bars.
[00:49:21.423 --> 00:49:23.543]  Those are about to sell out, so we had to end the special on those.
[00:49:24.123 --> 00:49:27.344]  And you get to fund the revolution against the globalists.
[00:49:27.404 --> 00:49:28.204]  It's a win-win.
[00:49:28.585 --> 00:49:32.026]  They fear this model of direct sale to fund media.
[00:49:32.046 --> 00:49:35.146]  They always use boycotts to terrorize and control people.
[00:49:35.306 --> 00:49:38.187]  And that's why this model we've built is the maverick.
[00:49:38.487 --> 00:49:39.088]  It is the winner.
[00:49:39.548 --> 00:49:40.948]  And you are the reason we're here.
[00:49:41.028 --> 00:49:43.149]  So again, I don't just say that to pat you on the head.
[00:49:43.469 --> 00:49:44.009]  You're it!
[00:49:45.145 --> 00:49:46.426]  You're the oxygen I breathe.
[00:49:46.447 --> 00:49:51.012]  You're the ground under my feet and the sky above my head.
[00:49:51.072 --> 00:49:52.554]  I mean, we're all in this together.
[00:49:53.555 --> 00:49:54.916]  So when I thank you, I mean it.
[00:49:55.077 --> 00:49:55.877]  Thank you.
[00:49:56.738 --> 00:49:57.840]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:49:58.541 --> 00:50:00.062]  But you may not have a dime.
[00:50:00.984 --> 00:50:04.947]  You're just as important as Bill Gates, because you can spread the word and take action.
[00:50:04.967 --> 00:50:05.748]  You have a connection to God.
[00:50:06.028 --> 00:50:15.315]  Going back to Clyde Lewis, big syndicated host with Ground Zero, weeknights on over, what is it, 500 stations across the country, right before George Norie and Coast to Coast AM, Ground Zero media.
[00:50:15.375 --> 00:50:19.077]  You were getting into Trump, and then, I mean, I like this new move he's taken.
[00:50:19.858 --> 00:50:27.404]  Some of the things I don't like, like big tech immunity in the new North American Union renegotiation, but I think that'll get taken out in Congress.
[00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:30.246]  But getting back into Trump, then I want to ask you, you're a smart guy.
[00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:33.892]  Claude Lewis, where do you see all this going?
[00:50:33.952 --> 00:50:38.797]  Because the elite basically say in their own white papers, as you know, they believe civilization is going to collapse.
[00:50:39.238 --> 00:50:45.384]  So they're just helping it along and they want to have a controlled collapse, a controlled demolition.
[00:50:45.404 --> 00:50:47.586]  Well, I don't want them to control my destiny.
[00:50:47.986 --> 00:50:50.729]  And so far, a lot of their plans have not been carried out the way they thought.
[00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:53.272]  But they're still, I would say, in partial control.
[00:50:53.292 --> 00:50:54.072]  Do you disagree with that?
[00:50:54.092 --> 00:50:54.473]  Do you agree?
[00:50:55.396 --> 00:51:03.081]  I would say that if you take a look at how old the United States is, we're, what, 241 years old, and you look at the Roman Empire, it lasts about 300-some-odd years.
[00:51:03.101 --> 00:51:07.004]  I mean, that doesn't mean that our empire and our government is going to last that long, either.
[00:51:07.084 --> 00:51:12.607]  We have a lot of people pushing a new government that is un-American, and we allow it to happen.
[00:51:12.988 --> 00:51:19.052]  I mean, just to cite my source I was talking about earlier, it was a volume of the American Political Science Review in 1950.
[00:51:19.252 --> 00:51:22.074]  It was called Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System.
[00:51:22.774 --> 00:51:22.995]  We're good.
[00:51:39.197 --> 00:51:43.380]  And then the left and right orthodoxies, just like Islam only gets more extreme, the left only gets more extreme.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.641]  Yeah, they become sectarian and extreme.
[00:52:04.611 --> 00:52:04.751]  I don't
[00:52:23.611 --> 00:52:31.415]  And Clyde, don't you agree, it's in WikiLeaks too, that the globalists are destabilizing on purpose.
[00:52:31.435 --> 00:52:38.318]  They're trying to sabotage our system by playing it off against each other to bring in the corporate fascist technocracy model.
[00:52:39.167 --> 00:52:39.707]  Well, of course.
[00:52:40.307 --> 00:52:42.048]  It's the Chinese model, is what it is.
[00:52:42.088 --> 00:52:44.509]  They've been wanting the Chinese model for some time.
[00:52:44.529 --> 00:52:53.813]  They probably won't get it until 2030, because that would take time to create the frustration and division needed to create the schism, and that would breed extremism and radicalism.
[00:52:53.833 --> 00:52:56.534]  That's why we're seeing radicalism and extremism being focused upon.
[00:52:56.974 --> 00:52:58.134]  The system has gone rogue.
[00:52:58.415 --> 00:53:03.897]  The two-party system is fragmenting to the point that those who see the extremism with their own political parties are bowing out.
[00:53:03.917 --> 00:53:05.217]  They're saying, I didn't sign up for this.
[00:53:05.577 --> 00:53:07.658]  I didn't sign up for New Green Deal.
[00:53:07.718 --> 00:53:09.619]  I didn't sign up for this.
[00:53:09.699 --> 00:53:13.301]  I didn't sign up for these other, you know, ideas that are extreme.
[00:53:13.701 --> 00:53:22.064]  And I know it's uncomfortable to hear this, but it's becoming apparent that the two-party system can no longer be efficient because there's this massive split decision attitude with everything.
[00:53:22.284 --> 00:53:24.005]  We want to get rid of the electoral college.
[00:53:24.585 --> 00:53:26.327]  Wow, we want the 16-year-old vote.
[00:53:26.547 --> 00:53:32.995]  Think of these extreme ideas within the parties, and no one can no longer agree with every radical view that is expressed for the established agenda.
[00:53:33.015 --> 00:53:40.303]  So, it's impossible to identify or support every issue that's being drummed up or presented within the party, because your morals won't allow it.
[00:53:41.039 --> 00:53:46.482]  And you can't say you're morally straight if you're basically going after all these extreme views.
[00:53:46.542 --> 00:53:51.945]  It's like, how many people on the left support this new abortion law in New York?
[00:53:52.406 --> 00:53:54.427]  And if you do, are you sick?
[00:53:54.887 --> 00:54:02.491]  I mean, look, I've always been, like you say, I mean, I've been pretty fair with how I feel, and I've always said, well, it's not my decision to tell a woman what to do with her body.
[00:54:02.531 --> 00:54:03.372]  I'm not going to do that.
[00:54:03.732 --> 00:54:11.736]  But then when they talk about how on the day of birth they can kill a kid, come on, can you really, with moral values, support something like that?
[00:54:11.756 --> 00:54:23.401]  Exactly, they're now taking the woman's right and extending it at her birth in a new sick right, and Beto O'Rourke and all the people agree with it, and the Democrats all gleefully clap their hands.
[00:54:23.461 --> 00:54:28.203]  They've now been put into a position of like Jim Jones' cult.
[00:54:28.363 --> 00:54:31.585]  Now we're having a debate, let's not kill viable born babies?
[00:54:32.325 --> 00:54:40.587]  Right, and can you really support LGBTQ if all of the members there think that 11-year-olds can dance in strip clubs and drag?
[00:54:40.787 --> 00:54:41.528]  Give me a break.
[00:54:41.728 --> 00:54:50.050]  This is something that, you know, immediately the extremes are taking over, and if you say anything, people say, well, you know, I'm a liberal, so therefore I have to stick with this.
[00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:51.450]  No, you don't.
[00:54:51.611 --> 00:55:00.153]  Exactly, and let me ask this question, because it's only whoever leads your cult or your group, they define what you've now got to follow, and it just gets more crazy by the minute.
[00:55:01.027 --> 00:55:08.417]  Well, it got me feeling a little weird when I saw these kids who were striking and sitting out of classes saying they were all going to die in 12 years if we don't combat climate change.
[00:55:08.437 --> 00:55:09.158]  Are you kidding me?
[00:55:09.518 --> 00:55:15.947]  That's an extreme view presented by Ocasio-Cortez, and it's almost like all those children, and it was like all those children, were parents.
[00:55:15.947 --> 00:55:16.488]  We're good to go.
[00:55:35.447 --> 00:55:46.552]  Because there's old school Democrat, there's old school Republican, but we have neoliberals and neocons that are basically trying to take over the system and they're destabilizing the system and like I said it will clash with our constitutional republic.
[00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:55.773]  Well, when you get into the WikiLeaks and other documents, going back to WikiLeaks because it's their admissions, they want a civil war that they control.
[00:55:56.554 --> 00:56:01.256]  And then they claim that I want one when it's the opposite and then they misrepresent what I've said.
[00:56:01.736 --> 00:56:13.921]  So even though I'm not the extremist they claim I am, they build a straw man and put that out so that they can make their side more extreme by using me as the symbol of extremism to then actually radicalize their own people.
[00:56:14.764 --> 00:56:15.325]  Oh, exactly.
[00:56:15.345 --> 00:56:23.352]  They'll use their own straw men and they'll say, like, you're the extremist side of conservatism, while they'll have their extreme sides and get away with it.
[00:56:23.392 --> 00:56:34.262]  I mean, there was a time when our two-party system was praised for how it was moderate, unlike you see other dogmatic ideological parties in Europe.
[00:56:34.722 --> 00:56:43.729]  But now we have this winner-take-all attitude where we say, well, we'd rather see the vote go younger and we'd rather see electoral college go away.
[00:56:44.009 --> 00:56:44.250]  Why?
[00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:55.098]  Well, that gives us an advantage because we want to be able to, I mean, look, no party can convincingly win a majority by putting forward extremist anti-system candidates far outside the mainstream, but this is changing.
[00:56:55.118 --> 00:57:03.805]  This is bucking the trend because something has gone wrong instead of being, you know, rejected and saying, no, no, no, no, we're not going to allow the commentary about
[00:57:04.185 --> 00:57:04.926]  We're good to go.
[00:57:24.344 --> 00:57:27.746]  Well, we'll talk when we come back, but you just described the heart of it.
[00:57:28.447 --> 00:57:29.708]  Something's been abandoned.
[00:57:30.168 --> 00:57:30.668]  What is it?
[00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:35.131]  We're going to quantify that and get his really expert take on that.
[00:57:35.191 --> 00:57:37.253]  Clyde Lewis, RoundZeroMedia.org.
[00:57:37.313 --> 00:57:38.213]  A lot of great stuff there.
[00:57:38.694 --> 00:57:45.218]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWars.com, and the only way this gets out to new people is if you word of mouth tell people.
[00:57:45.478 --> 00:57:47.800]  They're even censoring email and text messages now.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:48.820]  Oh yeah, that's coming up.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:49.421]  I'll tell you about that.
[00:57:54.713 --> 00:57:55.715]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[00:57:55.935 --> 00:57:57.457]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:57:57.517 --> 00:57:57.858]  Hello.
[00:57:58.038 --> 00:58:02.925]  Alex, if I can just quickly, InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you for Polnblock.
[00:58:03.145 --> 00:58:03.786]  It's amazing.
[00:58:03.886 --> 00:58:09.655]  I've used so many different antihistamines over the years because I get really bad hay fever, and the antihistamines
[00:58:10.035 --> 00:58:13.977]  Sometimes work, sometimes don't, but they never quite work fully.
[00:58:14.017 --> 00:58:16.718]  They don't block all the symptoms, they just kind of dry you up.
[00:58:16.798 --> 00:58:18.979]  At least that's what they do for me, if they work at all.
[00:58:18.999 --> 00:58:20.520]  But pollen block, it works.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:21.701]  It stops everything.
[00:58:21.821 --> 00:58:25.843]  I don't get the itchy eyes, I'm not sneezing, and I don't get the irritation.
[00:58:25.983 --> 00:58:26.723]  It is amazing.
[00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:29.065]  This is a known patent out of France.
[00:58:29.085 --> 00:58:30.526]  You have to pay for the patent.
[00:58:31.006 --> 00:58:39.734]  They just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[00:58:39.914 --> 00:58:42.316]  How fast did it take for pollen block to kick in for you?
[00:58:42.776 --> 00:58:47.420]  Well, that's the great part about this, and for whatever reason, France discovered it like 50 years ago.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:49.482]  It's still got to be even in this region of France.
[00:58:49.582 --> 00:58:50.323]  It's very complex.
[00:58:50.363 --> 00:58:52.425]  They don't even know why, but they think it's
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:09.680]  I think?
[00:59:31.121 --> 00:59:33.902]  Or in Africa, where Latin America is already a best-seller.
[00:59:33.982 --> 00:59:35.622]  Because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason.
[00:59:35.702 --> 00:59:40.924]  And in Europe, and in Russia, and in Canada, there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs.
[00:59:41.444 --> 00:59:42.004]  It's not here.
[00:59:42.424 --> 00:59:45.845]  So we just made a souped-up version of it and discounted it, and it's Palm Block.
[00:59:45.905 --> 00:59:47.205]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:55.071 --> 00:59:59.172]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.672 --> 01:00:01.033]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:08.015 --> 01:00:11.836]  Yeah, they got some really nice girls down there.
[01:00:11.856 --> 01:00:13.037]  LaGrange?
[01:00:25.106 --> 01:00:25.787]  It's to my back.
[01:00:26.888 --> 01:00:28.269]  Lukenbach is to my front.
[01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:31.413]  Oh, I'm in Fable, Texas.
[01:00:31.713 --> 01:00:32.854]  What's left of it.
[01:00:33.214 --> 01:00:35.837]  Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha.
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.381]  Clyde Lewis is our guest.
[01:00:44.966 --> 01:00:47.929]  He said, basically, if you just tuned in,
[01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:53.291]  That they've abandoned all reason, they've abandoned any rules, win or take all.
[01:00:53.831 --> 01:00:59.372]  And you know, people think, oh, most cultures develop chivalry because they're wimps.
[01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:05.514]  No, the most aggressive, the highest IQ, the best warriors always have chivalry.
[01:01:05.534 --> 01:01:07.694]  Because we don't want to kill women and children.
[01:01:08.315 --> 01:01:10.655]  Because we know what happens once you go down that path.
[01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:13.976]  It brings things out in people that create dark ages.
[01:01:15.656 --> 01:01:18.237]  But the Democrats particularly now, and leftists all over the world,
[01:01:19.404 --> 01:01:24.928]  Are defending radical Islam, even though it's antithetical of their leftist views.
[01:01:25.289 --> 01:01:27.551]  They're cheating in elections.
[01:01:27.571 --> 01:01:29.052]  They're anti-free speech.
[01:01:29.092 --> 01:01:30.733]  They're lying about people.
[01:01:31.274 --> 01:01:37.619]  Alexandria Cortez came out and said, oh, Laura Ingraham says, you know, basically I'm a dumb Latino woman.
[01:01:38.339 --> 01:01:38.940]  Where's the clip?
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:39.720]  She didn't say it.
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:40.641]  You're the liar.
[01:01:40.701 --> 01:01:42.402]  You're the racist creating that.
[01:01:43.523 --> 01:01:45.225]  And so when there's no bottom,
[01:01:46.243 --> 01:01:48.386]  These people think, oh, I just took the bottom out from you.
[01:01:48.746 --> 01:01:58.138]  But more often than not, when you take away the guardrails in society that were put there by experience, you now go off the edge of the cliff, not your enemy.
[01:01:58.598 --> 01:02:01.582]  And I see this all the time where people throw caution to the wind.
[01:02:01.622 --> 01:02:02.182]  They don't care.
[01:02:02.583 --> 01:02:03.524]  They don't understand.
[01:02:03.584 --> 01:02:05.386]  Clyde, I think that's what you just hit.
[01:02:06.437 --> 01:02:07.639]  How would you quantify that?
[01:02:08.019 --> 01:02:09.000]  Just a recklessness?
[01:02:09.701 --> 01:02:11.063]  Only thinking one-dimensionally?
[01:02:11.083 --> 01:02:16.651]  Because I see more and more people aren't thinking five, six, seven steps out.
[01:02:17.913 --> 01:02:21.697]  I think it's the pyramid that's been upside down.
[01:02:21.717 --> 01:02:30.606]  All players are supporting the same policies of centralization, and many of them say, okay, we'll just give the elites the power to basically make decisions for me.
[01:02:30.986 --> 01:02:38.574]  But here we are at the bottom of the pyramid, and many people are at the bottom of the pyramid, and there are numerous legitimate divides among common citizens, and the divides are real, they're not false.
[01:02:39.134 --> 01:02:45.677]  And these divides that we're having right now, the elites seek to exploit in order to destabilize this country.
[01:02:46.037 --> 01:02:49.678]  And here's the thing, I know why you're the scapegoat, Alex, and this is why.
[01:02:49.698 --> 01:02:54.880]  We have one divide that we have here, and we hear a lot about it.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.402]  It's the cycle divide between old-school Democrats and the New Green Deal, okay?
[01:02:59.702 --> 01:03:08.306]  Those are the socialist communists, and they're the ones that are basically saying, oh, we're being pooed upon and picked on, and they should be, because what they're doing is they're proposing something that's anti-American.
[01:03:08.826 --> 01:03:17.753]  So, and then we have another vitriolic divide, and that one is between common-sense conservatives and the double-down socialist cult within the Republican Party.
[01:03:18.053 --> 01:03:30.222]  It's the double-down socialist cult within the Republican Party, conservatives and liberals, that are using you as a scapegoat, because there's this covert divide that has created another breed of conservatives.
[01:03:30.242 --> 01:03:32.184]  There are neocons and there are other conservatives.
[01:03:32.204 --> 01:03:36.387]  There are classic liberals and classic conservatives, but the pattern is usually observed.
[01:03:37.007 --> 01:03:44.272]  And when anyone says, well, I'm one of those people that's in the middle and I want to bow out, they say, well, that's conspiracy theory.
[01:03:44.292 --> 01:03:46.094]  You're not a conspiracy theorist.
[01:03:46.174 --> 01:03:46.774]  You're a radical.
[01:03:46.914 --> 01:03:47.314]  Exactly.
[01:03:47.334 --> 01:03:52.158]  If you don't buy into whatever the left or right orthodoxy is and you're asking questions, well, you're the devil.
[01:03:52.955 --> 01:03:56.258]  And that's why we have Q, that's why we have you, that's why we have me.
[01:03:56.619 --> 01:04:02.304]  I mean, you more than me, because I'm, I mean, you get out there in the trenches and you basically expose yourself.
[01:04:02.765 --> 01:04:09.651]  So, you know, we have these sovereignty activists that say, well, let's unseat the system and put in people that are outsiders.
[01:04:09.691 --> 01:04:10.672]  And that's why we got Trump.
[01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:16.198]  Well, then the Democrats took a cue from that and said, well, why don't we unseat the old school and put in these young,
[01:04:16.638 --> 01:04:17.218]  Well, you're right.
[01:04:17.298 --> 01:04:19.920]  It's all getting more volatile.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.241]  Very thought-provoking talk.
[01:04:21.261 --> 01:04:23.262]  Clyde Lewis, have a great weekend, great show tonight.
[01:04:23.282 --> 01:04:23.843]  10 o'clock.
[01:04:23.863 --> 01:04:25.103]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:25.143 --> 01:04:25.604]  GroundZeroMedia.org.
[01:04:25.664 --> 01:04:26.504]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:46.255 --> 01:04:53.942]  Alright folks, we'll be back with Jack Posobiec at OAN Network, also Naval Intelligence, big Trump booster, smart guy.
[01:04:54.282 --> 01:04:58.026]  We'll talk about all the big things happening and Trump striking back against censorship.
[01:04:58.306 --> 01:04:58.886]  Newswars.com.
[01:04:58.906 --> 01:05:00.348]  Spread that link, please.
[01:05:00.628 --> 01:05:01.229]  Newswars.com.
[01:05:04.147 --> 01:05:08.331]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[01:05:09.111 --> 01:05:12.914]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[01:05:13.354 --> 01:05:20.380]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:23.522]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[01:05:24.403 --> 01:05:27.885]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:32.178]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[01:05:32.358 --> 01:05:33.898]  We are the power structure.
[01:05:34.398 --> 01:05:35.419]  We are the inventors.
[01:05:35.999 --> 01:05:37.059]  We are the trailblazers.
[01:05:37.779 --> 01:05:40.620]  And the globalists understand that.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:47.122]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[01:05:48.282 --> 01:05:52.083]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[01:05:53.138 --> 01:06:02.090]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping and 50% off at importstore.com.
[01:06:02.251 --> 01:06:03.613]  Something everybody should take advantage of.
[01:06:20.718 --> 01:06:24.621]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:26.222 --> 01:06:30.966]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.776 --> 01:06:47.258]  Jack Wasowiec is an American News correspondent.
[01:06:48.126 --> 01:06:53.969]  For One American News Network, at Twitter, at Jack Posobiec, O-A-N-N dot com.
[01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:57.171]  I've got some exciting news that Jack brought to my attention.
[01:06:58.232 --> 01:07:08.618]  Cloud TV is one of those big, fast-growing systems like Roku, and it's got hundreds and hundreds of channels, and InfoWars is top-rated.
[01:07:09.631 --> 01:07:10.372]  On cloud TV.
[01:07:11.052 --> 01:07:12.213]  It is now the top rated one.
[01:07:12.694 --> 01:07:13.915]  They only put us on there a few months ago.
[01:07:13.935 --> 01:07:16.277]  Outranking the Blaze and Newsmax.
[01:07:17.018 --> 01:07:18.880]  CloudTV.com.
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:19.540]  Great system.
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:23.024]  I've replaced Roku at my house since they took me off.
[01:07:24.144 --> 01:07:32.346]  The Sandy Hook family lawyers went on the news and said, Jones is sending people to our houses on there right now, taking them off air.
[01:07:32.386 --> 01:07:33.106]  None of that was even true.
[01:07:33.146 --> 01:07:34.127]  Never sent anybody to their houses.
[01:07:34.447 --> 01:07:36.367]  They were back on NPR last weekend saying it.
[01:07:36.767 --> 01:07:38.688]  It's clear and present danger, like I'm Big Bad Wolf.
[01:07:39.708 --> 01:07:40.908]  But that's how they operate.
[01:07:40.928 --> 01:07:42.509]  But Cloud TV has stood up against that.
[01:07:43.769 --> 01:07:48.751]  And you learned why we're being taken down because we're number one, just like when we were number one on news.
[01:07:49.272 --> 01:07:59.697]  We just happened to launch our app two weeks before the big banning last August, and we were already in the top 50, and we shot to number one in news, so they delisted it and then removed it.
[01:07:59.957 --> 01:08:00.897]  You can still get it on Android.
[01:08:00.917 --> 01:08:02.138]  I don't want to talk about myself, but...
[01:08:02.938 --> 01:08:08.205]  This was pointed out by Jack Posobiec, so I appreciate him joining us.
[01:08:08.566 --> 01:08:13.612]  Jack Posobiec, of course, has run one of the biggest grassroots probe Trump sites.
[01:08:14.534 --> 01:08:17.618]  Originally from the Philadelphia area, Jack has worked for four presidential campaigns.
[01:08:17.938 --> 01:08:20.620]  Well, there's numerous candidates for Senate, Congress, and Governor.
[01:08:20.961 --> 01:08:21.922]  He's a veteran of the U.S.
[01:08:21.962 --> 01:08:23.623]  Navy with multiple deployments overseas.
[01:08:24.044 --> 01:08:25.445]  He's fluent in Mandarin Chinese.
[01:08:25.665 --> 01:08:26.606]  That's why I wanted to get him on.
[01:08:27.106 --> 01:08:28.227]  Weeks ago it was about China.
[01:08:28.608 --> 01:08:29.248]  He was too busy.
[01:08:29.548 --> 01:08:33.232]  But now Trump's signed this order to go after the universities, violating free speech.
[01:08:33.452 --> 01:08:34.973]  That's so smart.
[01:08:35.254 --> 01:08:35.974]  Best place to hit.
[01:08:36.274 --> 01:08:38.116]  He controls that funding via the executive order.
[01:08:38.316 --> 01:08:40.518]  There'll be a battle, but still it points out what's happening.
[01:08:40.538 --> 01:08:42.360]  This is the cavalry coming over the hill.
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.141]  I'm going to get his take on that.
[01:08:43.701 --> 01:08:48.265]  And then General Dunford, the chairman, saying, look, Google and others have just basically moved to China.
[01:08:48.565 --> 01:08:50.747]  It's beyond China stealing our stuff.
[01:08:51.268 --> 01:08:53.390]  They're just taking over our DARPA infrastructure.
[01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:54.991]  Obama set this in motion.
[01:08:55.311 --> 01:08:56.572]  And Jack's worked in China.
[01:08:56.933 --> 01:09:00.136]  Doesn't work there, obviously, classified work and other things you can't get into.
[01:09:00.176 --> 01:09:02.157]  But, Jack, it's good to have you here with us.
[01:09:02.618 --> 01:09:04.900]  And it's great to see your shining face there.
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:09.524]  Give us your take on either one of these issues first, and then whatever else is on your radar screen.
[01:09:10.851 --> 01:09:12.193]  Well, Alex, appreciate being on.
[01:09:12.213 --> 01:09:17.501]  Thanks for having me, as always, and I appreciate you standing up, of course, for freedom, standing up for the First Amendment.
[01:09:17.741 --> 01:09:20.966]  We're seeing it now on the college campuses, and it's fantastic.
[01:09:21.347 --> 01:09:26.194]  So much of the territory there, so much of what's going on on college campuses is
[01:09:26.954 --> 01:09:33.178]  It's a travesty and I've actually been something, this is something that I fought all the way going back to my own college days over a decade ago.
[01:09:33.459 --> 01:09:38.902]  I actually brought David Horowitz and the David Horowitz Freedom Center onto campus with me, Temple University, 2006.
[01:09:38.982 --> 01:09:46.767]  We sued, we actually sued our school over academic freedom because we received public funding, a little bit of public funding.
[01:09:46.807 --> 01:09:50.170]  And so you can go back and look at this, it's all news and local in Philadelphia.
[01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:53.312]  We sued, we brought in state legislators, we did
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:05.648]  All sorts of hearings on this, and we had students, myself included, give testimony over the bias of these professors talking about what they were talking about, pushing their politics in a classroom where you shouldn't be pushing politics at all.
[01:10:05.748 --> 01:10:11.092]  And back then, 2006, I was right when the global warming stuff was really, really kicking off, so that was a huge topic.
[01:10:11.472 --> 01:10:19.098]  But I think it's today, and it's great the president's doing this on campuses, but we also need to look to the social media censorship.
[01:10:19.638 --> 01:10:20.459]  And one thing
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:30.649]  That I've actually been in discussions with with Ron Coleman, who's a free speech lawyer and others about is not necessarily about what can be done at the federal level.
[01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:34.153]  But what's very interesting is he started to think about it in a different way.
[01:10:34.213 --> 01:10:44.203]  He said, what about if we looked at this from a state by state basis and actually used state legislation in some cases to make it possible?
[01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:50.987]  To bring legal action against these corporations for shutting people down.
[01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:58.516]  And here's the specific language that he was using, shutting them down without breaking their actual terms of service.
[01:10:58.536 --> 01:10:59.357]  So here's how it would go.
[01:11:00.293 --> 01:11:02.794]  And anyway, it's just really something that we're brainstorming right now.
[01:11:03.474 --> 01:11:06.495]  But it would basically be a Consumer Protection Act.
[01:11:06.575 --> 01:11:09.256]  It would be a consumer protection of digital rights.
[01:11:09.597 --> 01:11:11.637]  And essentially, it holds them to their own standards.
[01:11:11.677 --> 01:11:18.200]  It says, if you have terms of service on your service, right, on your platform, but they call them edge providers.
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.561]  So Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.
[01:11:21.001 --> 01:11:21.421]  YouTube.
[01:11:22.041 --> 01:11:25.823]  And this person has not broken that terms of service.
[01:11:26.488 --> 01:11:35.363]  Or you cannot provide any explanation as to why they actually have been banned or have been shut down without providing a specific break.
[01:11:35.885 --> 01:11:54.397]  And if you're not applying that across the board to all pushers and all users of your content, of people who put their content on these platforms, then it would create a mechanism by which people who have been wrongfully treated, and essentially because of what it is, it's discrimination against political orientation, right?
[01:11:54.437 --> 01:12:00.681]  We have gender discrimination, we have religious discrimination, but we don't have protection for political orientation yet.
[01:12:00.721 --> 01:12:03.623]  We don't have protection for political ideology yet in this country.
[01:12:03.903 --> 01:12:04.963]  And that's what this would set up.
[01:12:05.003 --> 01:12:08.224]  You'd be able to then bring forward a legal case on a state-by-state basis.
[01:12:08.284 --> 01:12:11.324]  Sure, we see Louisiana now moving in that direction.
[01:12:12.345 --> 01:12:19.066]  Right, and so we're looking at Louisiana, we're looking at Florida, other possible test states for this to be enacted and move forward.
[01:12:19.306 --> 01:12:25.287]  And then we're also going to be working with people who are big on those states and hopefully trying to find people that have been banned in those states.
[01:12:25.687 --> 01:12:26.448]  Donald Trump Jr.
[01:12:26.488 --> 01:12:28.808]  has been really big on this, pushing this fight back because
[01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:36.551]  And we think if we do it on a state-by-state level, obviously, it's going to be the more conservative states, conservative AGs are going to be on board with this.
[01:12:36.891 --> 01:12:40.732]  But then the other ones will have to join in.
[01:12:41.112 --> 01:12:47.315]  And if we can get enough support behind it, if we can get enough backing behind it, then it's going to end up being national anyway.
[01:12:47.335 --> 01:12:48.095]  No, I agree with you.
[01:12:48.115 --> 01:12:54.897]  Because folks aren't going to sit there and try to figure out one set of laws or 50 sets of laws for each of the 50 states.
[01:12:54.937 --> 01:12:56.418]  No, they're going to go with one standard.
[01:12:56.638 --> 01:12:59.319]  And they're going to use whatever the strongest standard is.
[01:12:59.359 --> 01:13:01.599]  So we set the standard with this legislation.
[01:13:02.099 --> 01:13:04.600]  Well, for 30 years, big tech has been treated like royalty.
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:05.480]  They can do whatever they want.
[01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:06.860]  That honeymoon is over.
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:11.321]  And their abuse of the people and all the things they've done has now left them open.
[01:13:11.381 --> 01:13:15.302]  So there's going to be a fight between the left, the right, and everybody else over the new architecture.
[01:13:15.322 --> 01:13:18.183]  And I just think the left and the universities
[01:13:20.223 --> 01:13:43.042]  Creating the propagandists who then people the big tech are just racing for the finish line But I think at an instinctive and also historical level and a gut level It's going to boomerang around and backfire on them in a big way And I think Trump going after the money to really the incubation center of the censorship and the tyranny the universities Is is a giant opening salvo.
[01:13:43.062 --> 01:13:44.062]  What do you have to say about that?
[01:13:44.102 --> 01:13:45.604]  And what's the word in DC Jack?
[01:13:46.937 --> 01:13:49.358]  I completely agree on that, and this is something in D.C.
[01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.919]  where it really caught them by surprise.
[01:13:51.979 --> 01:14:09.587]  They didn't see Trump moving on this front, and that's been something that the President has always been very careful to do and always been very smart to do, is that he doesn't approach these systems and he doesn't approach these issues the way they assume he will, so he doesn't attack things directly.
[01:14:10.027 --> 01:14:10.227]  Right?
[01:14:10.267 --> 01:14:18.150]  People don't realize, and as you've said, they don't realize that the universities are a pathway to Silicon Valley because so much of Silicon Valley is in bed with these universities.
[01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:34.015]  They don't realize that what he's doing is essentially, it's like when you're up against an enemy force and you're attacking their supply chains, he's going into the back end, figuring out how they work, figuring out where their weak spots are, and then using that against them instead of attacking them directly on the front.
[01:14:34.375 --> 01:14:36.336]  Sure, it's like blowing up Nazi tank factories.
[01:14:37.277 --> 01:14:41.360]  But instead, he's going to go in and say, the brainwashing stops, you're going to quit it, or I'm going to take your money.
[01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:47.344]  And again, just like the CIA, which is the same thing as Google, recruits out of the universities, that's what they're doing.
[01:14:47.384 --> 01:14:57.792]  And they use it as an incubation center to teach them there's no free speech, to teach them to censor, then they take them out of that cloistered group and put them in a command position as a censor, as a surveyor.
[01:14:58.492 --> 01:14:59.313]  It's really outrageous.
[01:14:59.333 --> 01:15:03.696]  They've built their own private intelligence agencies with SJWs within big tech.
[01:15:05.256 --> 01:15:10.022]  Yeah, we're actually seeing a lot of this in terms of what they're doing.
[01:15:10.063 --> 01:15:14.729]  They call them off-site contractors, third-party contractors.
[01:15:15.417 --> 01:15:23.902]  Jack Dorsey referred to them as off-site laboratories, which I thought was actually interesting, and it was something that he mentioned on a podcast recently.
[01:15:24.162 --> 01:15:30.886]  He talked about off-site laboratories, that specific phrase they used, that are being used to monitor this content.
[01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:37.490]  So because so much of it is done outside of house, we don't have the same protection, the same insight, and it gives implausible deniability.
[01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:43.355]  And next up, we know where a lot of it's being tested, China, where they can get away with it completely with Dragonfly and more.
[01:15:43.756 --> 01:15:47.459]  We'll talk about that with a China expert, Jack Posobiec, in our final segment with him.
[01:15:47.479 --> 01:15:48.320]  Really appreciate him joining us.
[01:15:48.821 --> 01:15:54.706]  Again, folks, CloudTV, K-L-O-W-D-TV.com.

[01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:39.213]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[01:17:39.434 --> 01:17:44.137]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[01:17:44.738 --> 01:17:50.602]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[01:17:51.002 --> 01:18:03.612]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[01:18:04.372 --> 01:18:05.933]  Unlike other systems.
[01:18:05.973 --> 01:18:11.478]  I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[01:18:11.498 --> 01:18:13.039]  He writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[01:18:13.059 --> 01:18:14.961]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[01:18:15.281 --> 01:18:16.462]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[01:18:16.482 --> 01:18:17.723]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[01:18:17.903 --> 01:18:19.084]  He doesn't drink anything.
[01:18:19.224 --> 01:18:20.764]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[01:18:21.284 --> 01:18:22.925]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[01:18:23.225 --> 01:18:24.685]  I only have to take one knockout.
[01:18:25.045 --> 01:18:27.646]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[01:18:27.686 --> 01:18:28.546]  This is insane.
[01:18:28.966 --> 01:18:30.586]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[01:18:30.826 --> 01:18:33.387]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[01:18:33.827 --> 01:18:37.208]  He says, this is totally free, but he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[01:18:37.228 --> 01:18:39.108]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:45.890]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:47.470]  All just moderate dose.
[01:18:49.002 --> 01:18:56.985]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[01:18:57.025 --> 01:18:59.405]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:18:59.445 --> 01:19:00.586]  But thank you for committing.
[01:19:04.662 --> 01:19:07.485]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[01:19:07.865 --> 01:19:10.467]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[01:19:10.487 --> 01:19:15.252]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[01:19:15.732 --> 01:19:21.857]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[01:19:21.877 --> 01:19:25.000]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[01:19:25.341 --> 01:19:26.642]  It's called reap what you show.
[01:19:34.372 --> 01:19:43.794]  We're going to do, this Thursday through Friday through Saturday, a 50-hour emergency Save the First Amendment broadcast with a bunch of special guests and a bunch of stuff we've never done before.
[01:19:43.934 --> 01:19:45.054]  Believe me, this is going to be special.
[01:19:45.154 --> 01:19:46.014]  Thursday 8 a.m.
[01:19:46.034 --> 01:19:49.615]  with David Knight, right through Saturday 10 a.m., 50 hours, a bunch of special guests.
[01:19:49.735 --> 01:19:55.476]  We're going to blur out the violence, but we're going to look at all the anomalies, not even saying there's anomalies.
[01:19:55.636 --> 01:19:56.876]  We have a right to.
[01:19:57.076 --> 01:20:01.777]  The truth is, governments do do stuff like this, and it's legitimate for anybody to ask those type of questions.
[01:20:06.454 --> 01:20:09.176]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:22.224]  So, Susan Wozinski,
[01:20:33.976 --> 01:20:39.519]  The head of YouTube was on with Kara Swisher at the Lesbians in Tech event in San Francisco.
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:50.485]  And... Swisher said my adopted 13-year-old son, you know, likes Ben Shapiro.
[01:20:52.046 --> 01:20:52.947]  And I want him banned.
[01:20:52.987 --> 01:20:54.688]  And the YouTube lady says, yeah, I want to ban him too.
[01:20:55.799 --> 01:20:57.701]  They go, yeah, well we banned Alex Jones, why can't you ban him?
[01:20:57.721 --> 01:20:59.384]  She says, I told you to ban him and you did.
[01:21:00.205 --> 01:21:01.286]  So they're out in the open.
[01:21:01.306 --> 01:21:02.427]  I didn't violate their terms.
[01:21:02.467 --> 01:21:03.909]  I didn't beat up a kid on a video.
[01:21:03.929 --> 01:21:04.950]  They just made that up.
[01:21:05.431 --> 01:21:07.874]  And there's this arrogance of these people.
[01:21:07.934 --> 01:21:11.378]  And now they're working with China, YouTube's parent company.
[01:21:13.161 --> 01:21:14.602]  They're lying to Congress about it.
[01:21:15.811 --> 01:21:22.440]  And now General Dunford has come out, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, and said they're really concerned because they won't even work with the Pentagon.
[01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:24.302]  And I've learned what's happening at Google and places.
[01:21:24.603 --> 01:21:28.268]  Their employees will even rebel against the owners and the managers, and they do whatever they want!
[01:21:28.288 --> 01:21:28.348]  And...
[01:21:31.098 --> 01:21:33.299]  It's literally this rogue, out-of-control group.
[01:21:33.339 --> 01:21:37.520]  It's one thing if they don't want to work with the Pentagon, when they were set up by the Pentagon, set up by DARPA.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:41.581]  But it's a whole other thing when they then run to China, who holds the world record in tyranny.
[01:21:41.861 --> 01:21:46.263]  Jack Posobiec, I know you've got a lot of inside baseball on this, and lived in China, but in naval intelligence.
[01:21:47.243 --> 01:21:48.183]  What's coming out of this?
[01:21:48.223 --> 01:21:48.864]  What's your take?
[01:21:48.884 --> 01:21:49.624]  And what needs to be done?
[01:21:50.504 --> 01:21:56.087]  It's like an outrageous crime, like Google moving to China and helping impress their people, helping build systems to censor us here.
[01:21:56.607 --> 01:22:01.489]  It's so big, it's almost like too evil to fail, because something should have already been done, Jack.
[01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:17.256]  Alex, to take this to a higher level, and to get at what I think General Dunford was talking about, and also what we're looking at at a macro level, and I appreciate that you do look at this in terms of a macro level, China has a 100-year outlook.
[01:22:19.244 --> 01:22:35.838]  On their their program right now they're pushing forward towards 2049 2049 is going to be the hundred years of their since they founded the Communist Republic People's Republic of China and so for them it's they want to take
[01:22:36.776 --> 01:22:51.780]  All of the power, the social, political and economic and military power of the world and shift that balance of power to China because in their mind, they're shifting it back to China because China at one point was the leader of all of Asia.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:55.701]  And so for them to do that, what they're actually doing is
[01:22:56.553 --> 01:22:57.814]  They're pushing forward.
[01:22:58.194 --> 01:23:00.316]  And you can see this in all the academic journals.
[01:23:00.376 --> 01:23:01.377]  Everybody, they're very open.
[01:23:01.457 --> 01:23:04.680]  Oh, the Chinese century, our so-called elite, hates America.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.821]  They've wedded this.
[01:23:05.921 --> 01:23:10.104]  And the Pentagon needs to know it's their job, A, to stop this, B, it's Congress' job.
[01:23:10.765 --> 01:23:12.606]  They disrespect America.
[01:23:12.646 --> 01:23:14.328]  They've used our open society against us.
[01:23:14.808 --> 01:23:18.971]  And so if our government doesn't stop this, they're aiding and abetting it, in my view.
[01:23:18.991 --> 01:23:20.032]  But you're absolutely right, Jack.
[01:23:20.232 --> 01:23:20.753]  Please continue.
[01:23:21.894 --> 01:23:26.778]  Yeah, so you're looking at it in terms of the investors, you're looking at it in terms of social media.
[01:23:26.839 --> 01:23:29.941]  Hollywood, you can already see, is completely bought out by China.
[01:23:30.602 --> 01:23:32.664]  It's basically run by China at this point.
[01:23:32.704 --> 01:23:34.786]  Half of California is run by China at this point.
[01:23:35.126 --> 01:23:43.554]  And so for the Chinese, they view it as their upsurge, their upswing in the world in terms of geopolitics.
[01:23:44.134 --> 01:23:49.295]  And it's also seen that way by the elites and by the investor class and by the ruling class.
[01:23:49.595 --> 01:23:55.857]  So they want to be in bed with China because they know that they have decided, essentially, that China is going to be the future.
[01:23:55.897 --> 01:23:58.137]  They've decided that China is the market to be in.
[01:23:58.538 --> 01:24:02.318]  And for various reasons, they basically see America as in downfall.
[01:24:02.338 --> 01:24:03.459]  America is in decline.
[01:24:03.699 --> 01:24:07.480]  Barack Obama used to say this publicly, that America is in decline.
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:08.820]  And you hear this around D.C.
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:12.661]  all the time, that America's decline just needs a soft landing.
[01:24:13.121 --> 01:24:19.303]  America just needs to be, you know, a failed experiment and we can go back to the way things used to be before 1776.
[01:24:19.643 --> 01:24:30.326]  This is the type of discussion that people used to make before Trump came around, before freedom fighters like yourself, like One American News and others came around.
[01:24:30.707 --> 01:24:34.548]  They thought that America was going to fall and that China was going to be the next future.
[01:24:34.588 --> 01:24:38.229]  Well, unfortunately, even though America is having its resurgence,
[01:24:38.863 --> 01:24:43.447]  The capital, the money markets, everything else is still moving in terms of China.
[01:24:43.467 --> 01:24:46.169]  It's still pushing in terms of China being that winner.
[01:24:46.469 --> 01:24:54.635]  Because even though Trump is doing so much and we're doing so much to fight what's happening, they still have that hundred year outlook that has not changed.
[01:24:55.083 --> 01:24:56.724]  I've never heard a better breakdown of this.
[01:24:56.845 --> 01:25:08.534]  And the CFR, all of them, set up China, gave them all our industry, propped them up because our corrupt elites wanted to work with an authoritarian system unencumbered by our republic, by our courts, by our rules.
[01:25:08.814 --> 01:25:14.739]  And so that's why they've made the deal, because the globalists are authoritarian, and they believe China is the model to leverage out everybody else.
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:18.182]  If we stop them in the middle of the process, they're very, very weak.
[01:25:18.462 --> 01:25:24.006]  You've lived over there, you know that they're teetering because of their oppression of their people, of the corrupt party system.
[01:25:24.827 --> 01:25:26.809]  So the elite over here are trying to export.
[01:25:28.295 --> 01:25:37.983]  The Chinese social score here as fast as possible and kind of line up with China before we take the country back and take Europe back and defeat them.
[01:25:38.803 --> 01:25:41.405]  So I want to ask you, how do we accelerate that?
[01:25:41.465 --> 01:25:42.906]  How do we make sure that happens?
[01:25:43.627 --> 01:25:49.651]  And how do they ever put the genie back in the bottle now that America understands that this double cross happened?
[01:25:49.671 --> 01:25:52.073]  Because they fought so hard to suppress this understanding.
[01:25:52.394 --> 01:25:56.637]  But once this understanding is there and now it's front and center, isn't it really game over?
[01:25:57.785 --> 01:26:06.856]  One of the biggest things that President Trump has done that actually affects this in terms of the macro level is actually his tariff scheme, his tariff agenda.
[01:26:07.257 --> 01:26:08.719]  By putting tariffs
[01:26:09.452 --> 01:26:13.373]  On those companies and on their supply chains that they had already set up.
[01:26:13.393 --> 01:26:25.235]  Look, these companies go global because they're looking for cheaper markets, they're looking for cheap labor, they're looking for lax environmental standards, they're looking for being able to get the biggest bang for their buck and they don't care who gets exploited by it.
[01:26:25.515 --> 01:26:37.118]  That's what goes on throughout Asia and specifically China because they have this massive labor pool of people that in some cases it's little more than slavery or indentured servitude.
[01:26:37.438 --> 01:26:38.479]  In terms of what they receive.
[01:26:38.519 --> 01:26:41.981]  And so that's where our that's where all of the tech is being made.
[01:26:42.361 --> 01:26:51.287]  And so with Trump putting tariffs on that, with Trump putting tariffs on those supply chains, he's directly impacting the bottom line, their bottom line.
[01:26:51.607 --> 01:26:58.432]  And by directly impacting our bottom line in every step along the process, he's not it's you know, you hear this this like,
[01:26:59.770 --> 01:27:00.170]  We're good to go.
[01:27:21.457 --> 01:27:25.738]  And until that regime is changed, we need to stop thinking about our own elites taking it over.
[01:27:25.758 --> 01:27:26.499]  It's never going to happen.
[01:27:26.739 --> 01:27:37.282]  We have to cut them off, bring them to heel, and then try to bring in an unauthoritarian system there, or we can't merge with something that's as bad as Hitler or worse, in my view.
[01:27:37.602 --> 01:27:39.963]  And I don't think Dumford talking to Google is enough.
[01:27:40.343 --> 01:27:43.804]  This is outrageous espionage, outrageous criminal activity.
[01:27:43.984 --> 01:27:45.104]  They've all lied to Congress.
[01:27:45.144 --> 01:27:46.125]  And I'm not an authoritarian.
[01:27:46.485 --> 01:27:47.105]  But this is a war.
[01:27:47.825 --> 01:27:58.792]  And I've told Google and Apple and all of them, they're lucky that we, because George Washington, you know what George Washington, he was alive today and saw them do this, what George Washington would do.
[01:27:59.152 --> 01:28:00.233]  It'd take about five minutes.
[01:28:00.974 --> 01:28:05.176]  And so that's the real response to this level of treason, Jack Pasovic.
[01:28:05.376 --> 01:28:06.437]  We've got 50 seconds left.
[01:28:06.477 --> 01:28:07.678]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:13.073]  Trump needs to do more and more to end these corrupt supply chains.
[01:28:13.293 --> 01:28:18.576]  He needs to cut off the ties to China that were in terms of spreading our wealth and sending our wealth to China.
[01:28:18.596 --> 01:28:19.597]  He needs to continue to do that.
[01:28:19.657 --> 01:28:21.398]  And they're foreign meddling in our media and elections?
[01:28:22.642 --> 01:28:26.824]  And we need to roll up the ongoing Chinese espionage operations.
[01:28:26.864 --> 01:28:31.586]  We saw that with this massage parlor scandal, the people that were actually penetrating the government.
[01:28:31.646 --> 01:28:32.527]  We saw it in the Senate.
[01:28:32.727 --> 01:28:33.667]  We saw it in the House.
[01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:37.749]  Dianne Feinstein, her driver, all of this, the Chinese spies, the operations, they're here.
[01:28:37.989 --> 01:28:39.750]  They're here now, and they need to be shut down.
[01:28:40.291 --> 01:28:40.551]  Wow.
[01:28:41.031 --> 01:28:44.873]  Jack, please come back soon and get into the espionage networks and what China's done to us.
[01:28:44.953 --> 01:28:46.954]  I'd say, what, it's 50 times worse than Russia?
[01:28:47.314 --> 01:28:48.074]  What's your number on that?
[01:28:48.094 --> 01:28:50.636]  I mean, how much bigger is their penetration of the U.S.
[01:28:50.656 --> 01:28:51.016]  than Russia?
[01:28:51.676 --> 01:28:52.298]  A thousand times.
[01:28:52.839 --> 01:28:53.461]  A thousand, yeah.
[01:28:53.741 --> 01:28:55.907]  All right, Jack Posobiec, One American News Network.
[01:28:56.228 --> 01:28:57.651]  Great job, Aaron, on Cloud TV.
[01:28:57.671 --> 01:28:58.212]  God bless you.
[01:28:59.055 --> 01:28:59.456]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:28:59.897 --> 01:29:00.959]  We'll be right back with Joel Celente.
[01:29:08.473 --> 01:29:13.817]  This is the Save the First Amendment, Stop Big Tech, Stop the Bias 50-hour broadcast.
[01:29:13.837 --> 01:29:16.639]  We've got everybody from Laura Loomer to Tommy Robinson joining us.
[01:29:16.819 --> 01:29:20.521]  I believe Joe said he could do it, but Joe is famously busy, okay?
[01:29:20.541 --> 01:29:21.682]  But regardless, I'm going to interview with him.
[01:29:21.762 --> 01:29:22.443]  He's coming to town.
[01:29:22.503 --> 01:29:24.004]  And there's a bunch of other surprise guests.
[01:29:24.124 --> 01:29:25.144]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:29:25.244 --> 01:29:31.689]  From now right through Saturday morning, 10 a.m., focal point on free speech and a focal point on what we're fighting and what the stakes are.

[01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:03.709]  And you fund an operation where we get up here and fight the pedophiles and fight people openly saying we're gonna kill babies after they're born and sell their goodies.
[01:30:04.150 --> 01:30:05.371]  Because they want their goodies.
[01:30:06.383 --> 01:30:09.685]  Hell, I mean, the pedophiles, I guess, just rape the kids.
[01:30:09.705 --> 01:30:12.206]  These folks want to kill them better than to hammer and sell their goods.
[01:30:12.727 --> 01:30:14.067]  So, you shell their innards.
[01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:16.629]  Shell what the womb God created made.
[01:30:16.809 --> 01:30:18.050]  They just think we're going to take it.
[01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:19.371]  Well, some of us aren't going to take it.
[01:30:19.471 --> 01:30:26.695]  So, again, ladies and gentlemen, humanize these babies and give them at least as much value as the governor when he's not wearing a KKK outfit.
[01:30:26.735 --> 01:30:27.275]  Blackface.
[01:30:27.475 --> 01:30:27.936]  Totally evil.
[01:30:28.136 --> 01:30:29.136]  These innocent little children.
[01:30:29.156 --> 01:30:30.257]  Suffer little children under me.
[01:30:30.337 --> 01:30:33.639]  Better for someone to throw themselves in the deepest ocean with a giant stone tied around their neck.
[01:30:33.679 --> 01:30:34.940]  A millstone would hurt one of these.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:35.480]  Think about that.
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:37.621]  Quite frankly, I'm proud of what we've done together.
[01:30:37.762 --> 01:30:39.683]  You, the audience, are the InfoWar.
[01:30:40.263 --> 01:30:41.244]  I'm not just saying that.

[01:31:00.678 --> 01:31:01.219]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:04.514 --> 01:31:08.701]  This young fella put himself in front of me and wouldn't move.
[01:31:09.582 --> 01:31:18.276]  So they get to go free and go about their life and possibly attack someone else and I'm here to left with the aftermath of this bullcrap.
[01:31:19.173 --> 01:31:23.257]  Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter.
[01:31:23.918 --> 01:31:35.931]  I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.
[01:31:36.351 --> 01:31:40.692]  This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an I Am Spartacus moment.
[01:31:40.712 --> 01:31:46.933]  You know, that whole, suddenly America's, like, the biggest oil producer and the biggest... That was me.
[01:31:47.333 --> 01:31:53.754]  His family was bitterly opposed to their relationship because she was part Native American.
[01:31:53.774 --> 01:31:59.755]  We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire.
[01:31:59.875 --> 01:32:02.455]  Why do we keep making the same mistake?
[01:32:03.436 --> 01:32:05.596]  Because we're desperate to get Trump out of office.
[01:32:05.936 --> 01:32:10.322]  The return address said in big red, you know, like caps, MAGA.
[01:32:11.083 --> 01:32:11.984]  Did I make that up too?
[01:32:13.246 --> 01:32:16.490]  Believe in something, even if it never happened.
[01:32:17.199 --> 01:32:20.922]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[01:33:24.539 --> 01:33:25.640]  Big Brother.
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:26.900]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:28.581]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:29.341 --> 01:33:30.822]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:31.062 --> 01:33:32.182]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:32.722 --> 01:33:37.404]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:54.567]  To every student and young American here today, don't let anyone stop you from doing what you know is right, from asking questions, from challenging the powerful, or from speaking your mind.
[01:33:54.607 --> 01:33:56.748]  And that's the primary reason we're here right now.
[01:33:56.768 --> 01:33:57.869]  You're going to speak your mind.
[01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:59.410]  You're going to be fair.
[01:33:59.450 --> 01:34:00.451]  You're going to be reasonable.
[01:34:00.471 --> 01:34:01.451]  You're going to do it well.
[01:34:01.752 --> 01:34:02.992]  And you're going to speak your mind.
[01:34:04.133 --> 01:34:05.854]  Never, ever quit.
[01:34:06.715 --> 01:34:08.236]  Never give in.
[01:34:09.102 --> 01:34:11.243]  And never back down.
[01:34:11.804 --> 01:34:15.606]  Keep standing up for your values, for your classmates, and for your country.
[01:34:16.227 --> 01:34:23.852]  And you can be certain that every day of my presidency, we will always support your rights and your freedoms and your future.
[01:34:24.552 --> 01:34:26.253]  Thank you all for being here.
[01:34:26.273 --> 01:34:28.075]  This is a great honor for me.
[01:34:28.095 --> 01:34:29.636]  I've been watching this for too long.
[01:34:30.276 --> 01:34:33.861]  I've been watching things that are unwatchable, and I don't like it.
[01:34:34.322 --> 01:34:35.884]  But we're going to do something about it.
[01:34:35.924 --> 01:34:39.670]  See, we like to act as opposed to just watching and saying, oh, isn't that a shame?
[01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:40.932]  We don't say that.
[01:34:41.673 --> 01:34:42.394]  We don't say that.
[01:34:52.423 --> 01:34:56.347]  And I want to congratulate everybody, everybody for being here.
[01:34:56.407 --> 01:35:01.732]  You have just a tremendous future ahead of you, and this will make it a lot easier.
[01:35:02.232 --> 01:35:03.874]  And you get that point of view across.
[01:35:03.954 --> 01:35:05.436]  And listen to the other point of view.
[01:35:06.096 --> 01:35:07.838]  Maybe you can be changed, and maybe not.
[01:35:08.338 --> 01:35:08.819]  I doubt it.
[01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:11.558]  But maybe.
[01:35:11.858 --> 01:35:12.539]  You never know.
[01:35:13.319 --> 01:35:13.759]  And you know what?
[01:35:13.799 --> 01:35:14.900]  If you can, that's okay.
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:16.601]  And you'll change them, too.
[01:35:16.941 --> 01:35:18.122]  You're gonna change them, too.
[01:35:18.142 --> 01:35:20.183]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:35:20.683 --> 01:35:22.044]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:35:22.404 --> 01:35:25.926]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:35:27.227 --> 01:35:29.008]  And here's Jeff Landry, the Attorney General.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:34.143]  Louisiana, with the big state attack that's about to pop up, I'm told, in over 30 states.
[01:35:34.223 --> 01:35:37.285]  They're going to be filing suit and taking action in the next month.
[01:35:37.325 --> 01:35:42.789]  So, people get the tech censorship with the CHICOMs is the literal takeover of this country.
[01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:48.893]  And now, suddenly, everything you heard on this show a couple years ago is coming out of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's mouth.
[01:35:48.913 --> 01:35:50.515]  It's coming out of the President's mouth.
[01:35:51.485 --> 01:35:57.428]  Because we're here covering what's really going on, but we make it safe for everybody else to come out and say it later.
[01:35:57.528 --> 01:35:58.868]  We hit the barbed wire.
[01:35:59.188 --> 01:36:01.249]  Gerald Salenti joins us for the next 45 minutes or so.
[01:36:01.269 --> 01:36:07.752]  I'm going to go to my good friend here in a moment, but first, since I mentioned Jeff Landry, here is the Attorney General making the announcement.
[01:36:08.530 --> 01:36:14.355]  We've seen what makes America great is the fact that no one is bigger than the people, right?
[01:36:14.815 --> 01:36:20.700]  No one is truly bigger than the government, which, of course, is a government of the people.
[01:36:21.321 --> 01:36:28.287]  And when corporations historically in this country, in our free market economy, have
[01:36:29.099 --> 01:36:32.320]  So, what type of action is on the table?
[01:36:53.789 --> 01:36:56.411]  Well, I think that all action is on top of the table.
[01:36:56.751 --> 01:37:16.967]  In a couple of weeks, in fact, I think it's next week on the 25th, there is a roundtable being conducted by attorney generals in front of the FTC to discuss this, to discuss, you know, the harm that it's placing on consumers, whether or not it's going to, it would lead to antitrust action against the companies.
[01:37:17.988 --> 01:37:25.214]  Or whether or not we should be looking more carefully on any mergers or consolidations or buyouts by these tech companies.
[01:37:36.103 --> 01:37:40.587]  It's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:40.607 --> 01:37:42.088]  People are waking up all over the world.
[01:37:42.188 --> 01:37:45.171]  Doesn't mean it's fun for those of us that just have the spare.
[01:37:46.448 --> 01:37:51.071]  Gerald Cilente's been on Oprah Winfrey, he's been on every show out there, best-selling author since the 80s.
[01:37:52.071 --> 01:37:56.934]  He was trending higher than I was just a few years ago on Google, but they just censored and shadow-banned him.
[01:37:57.495 --> 01:37:59.115]  Didn't matter, he just keeps beavering away.
[01:38:00.857 --> 01:38:01.517]  And that's what we do.
[01:38:02.778 --> 01:38:06.900]  Because when you're censored and you're blocked, that's the mark of your accuracy.
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:10.042]  We're going to talk to Gerald Cilente at TrendsResearch.com.
[01:38:10.542 --> 01:38:11.283]  She's still on Twitter.
[01:38:13.075 --> 01:38:14.016]  At Gerald Cilente.
[01:38:14.036 --> 01:38:15.637]  We're going to go to him in a moment.
[01:38:15.717 --> 01:38:19.259]  Please don't forget we're Lister Supported and I try to make it easy.
[01:38:19.319 --> 01:38:22.620]  I go out and say, what's the highest rated air filter that's at the lowest price?
[01:38:23.181 --> 01:38:23.621]  And I get it.
[01:38:24.041 --> 01:38:25.182]  And I've become the biggest seller of it.
[01:38:25.582 --> 01:38:28.904]  So I get even bigger discounts and pass that on to you.
[01:38:29.584 --> 01:38:33.386]  We go out and find out what's the best fish oil from the top maker that's certified organic.
[01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:42.655]  Been tested, because I know they're going to test it, and I want it to work good for you, but I know where we're going to be a target, so I go out and get whatever's the cleanest and best already, because I know I'm a target anyways.
[01:38:42.795 --> 01:38:43.916]  Plus, I want you to love the product.
[01:38:45.016 --> 01:38:50.881]  And it's the same for our turmeric, our bodies, or our happy formula, the natural herbs, to help calm and give focus.
[01:38:52.282 --> 01:38:56.685]  Or Survival Shield X2 that I thought we couldn't get more of, the pure iodine, the good halogen, the X2.
[01:38:56.965 --> 01:38:57.746]  It's back in stock.
[01:38:58.703 --> 01:38:59.964]  Knockout, the great sleep aid.
[01:39:00.004 --> 01:39:05.367]  You know, I talked to some of the developers about five years ago and I said, you know, it's $19.95 for a bottle of melatonin.
[01:39:06.468 --> 01:39:09.410]  How much melatonin does it actually cost in that bottle?
[01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:10.311]  They said probably a dollar.
[01:39:11.731 --> 01:39:12.772]  And they sell it for $19.95.
[01:39:13.393 --> 01:39:20.097]  I said, well, will it go good with all these other things like L-tryptophan and valerian root and chamomile and lemon balm?
[01:39:20.137 --> 01:39:22.478]  And they go, oh yeah, that all works synergistically together.
[01:39:22.498 --> 01:39:24.560]  Well, I'll just put all that in there.
[01:39:25.765 --> 01:39:27.126]  And then I'll sell it for $19.95.
[01:39:27.786 --> 01:39:31.228]  It sure will cost me five, six times more, but that's still like $6 or something.
[01:39:31.749 --> 01:39:32.789]  And we sell it for $20.
[01:39:34.250 --> 01:39:36.732]  It's 60% off right now, so it's even lower than that.
[01:39:36.812 --> 01:39:37.232]  It's $11.98.
[01:39:38.153 --> 01:39:41.054]  So, that's my philosophy.
[01:39:41.214 --> 01:39:42.355]  And it works really, really good.
[01:39:42.535 --> 01:39:43.116]  It's organic.
[01:39:43.376 --> 01:39:45.977]  Sometimes the batches are so strong, one pill will knock you out.
[01:39:45.997 --> 01:39:46.898]  Sometimes it takes two.
[01:39:46.918 --> 01:39:48.018]  Because it's organic.
[01:39:48.079 --> 01:39:49.559]  This is not a drug.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:50.480]  It's not a chemical.
[01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:51.521]  It's from Mother Nature.
[01:39:52.361 --> 01:39:54.823]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:39:58.702]  All right, going to Gerald Cilente of TrendsResearch.com.
[01:39:58.743 --> 01:40:03.227]  Gerald, you know, I could always ask a bunch of questions of you, but you've always got a lot on your radar screen.
[01:40:13.597 --> 01:40:21.708]  But I do want to get to your report card on Trump, which I think went up a notch with him going after these anti-free speech bastions that are called universities now.
[01:40:22.148 --> 01:40:24.451]  The supposed place of free speech has become the inverse.
[01:40:25.112 --> 01:40:29.377]  And also Trump trying to pull out of these wars, but the government, deep state trying to block him.
[01:40:29.777 --> 01:40:31.219]  Mueller's report about to come out.
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:35.881]  Trump going after the Federal Reserve, pointing out they're the ones trying to stagnate the economy.
[01:40:36.302 --> 01:40:38.602]  There's so many things to get to here.
[01:40:39.063 --> 01:40:40.803]  The culture clash, even Bloomberg.
[01:40:40.863 --> 01:40:44.164]  Michael Bloomberg said, what's all this thing that white men are inherently evil?
[01:40:44.465 --> 01:40:45.605]  The Democrats have gone crazy.
[01:40:45.665 --> 01:40:51.047]  I mean, this is getting, when Bloomberg's saying it's insane, we'll probably see the Southern Poverty Law Center call him a Nazi next.
[01:40:51.407 --> 01:40:52.587]  It's just a crazy world.
[01:40:52.667 --> 01:40:56.029]  What would you as a historian call this period we're in right now?
[01:40:56.049 --> 01:40:56.649]  Gerald Salenta.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:02.763]  Well, when I was a kid, they used to have a thing called the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.
[01:41:03.424 --> 01:41:05.025]  It was the greatest show on Earth.
[01:41:06.166 --> 01:41:14.331]  Now the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus is out of business because it's been taken over by the greatest freak show on Earth.
[01:41:14.932 --> 01:41:17.614]  Name the country, look what's going on around it.
[01:41:18.154 --> 01:41:19.735]  I've never seen anything like it.
[01:41:20.456 --> 01:41:27.781]  And, you know, the big issue, one of the very big issues, and Trump, what I was just listening to, is on censorship.
[01:41:28.462 --> 01:41:31.724]  I mean, this is supposed to be the country of freedom of speech.
[01:41:32.824 --> 01:41:36.346]  One of our top trends, Alex, for 2019.
[01:41:36.526 --> 01:41:39.888]  It's right here in your Trends Journal.
[01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:43.770]  Censorship 2019.
[01:41:45.391 --> 01:41:46.291]  Freedom of speech.
[01:41:46.751 --> 01:41:47.812]  Freedom of expression.
[01:41:48.732 --> 01:41:49.573]  Forget about it.
[01:41:50.073 --> 01:41:51.914]  From the United States to China.
[01:41:52.755 --> 01:41:55.376]  From New Zealand to Nepal.
[01:41:57.972 --> 01:41:59.052]  Is a mega trend.
[01:41:59.933 --> 01:42:02.653]  Now remember, we wrote this in December.
[01:42:03.594 --> 01:42:07.575]  What did they just do now in New Zealand?
[01:42:08.275 --> 01:42:11.636]  You're not allowed to put up anything the government doesn't want you to put up.
[01:42:12.576 --> 01:42:17.918]  And in one day, Zamboom, bring in all your arms that we don't want you to have.
[01:42:18.158 --> 01:42:20.219]  And now they're banning Jordan Peterson books.
[01:42:22.519 --> 01:42:23.480]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:42:23.820 --> 01:42:25.840]  It's getting word everywhere.
[01:42:26.381 --> 01:42:27.621]  And in the United States,
[01:42:28.203 --> 01:42:29.584]  Oh, you know, I mean here.
[01:42:30.545 --> 01:42:33.768]  Facebook curbs anti-vaccine posts.
[01:42:34.108 --> 01:42:34.989]  Oh, I wanted to go there.
[01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.750]  Oh, stay there.
[01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:36.270]  We'll come right back.
[01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:36.891]  You'll have the floor.
[01:42:37.792 --> 01:42:43.437]  If you even try to show an insert to a vaccine saying it can kill you, because the insert says it, they will take down videos of inserts.
[01:42:44.378 --> 01:42:44.798]  Incredible.
[01:42:44.818 --> 01:42:45.999]  Talk about that with Gerald Cilente.
[01:42:46.259 --> 01:42:47.240]  The medical tyranny.
[01:42:47.541 --> 01:42:49.863]  Think of all the stuff medical stuff's done in drug companies.
[01:42:50.143 --> 01:42:52.765]  Now they're saying you don't criticize them or you're shut down.
[01:42:52.905 --> 01:42:53.086]  Wow.
[01:42:54.375 --> 01:42:54.975]  Gerald's right.
[01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:56.556]  Censorship is on the offense.
[01:42:56.716 --> 01:42:57.136]  Stay with us.
[01:42:57.156 --> 01:42:58.557]  TrendsResearch.com.
[01:43:03.039 --> 01:43:18.826]  In previous revolutions, some good, some bad, the revolutionaries funded themselves by robbing stagecoaches full of gold or robbing trains full of silver or basically going through the countryside and pillaging.
[01:43:19.813 --> 01:43:24.298]  Well, we've been blessed the 21st century in this great free market system that we've got.
[01:43:26.060 --> 01:43:33.429]  To be able to just use the free market and high quality products and the rules of commerce to go out and get great products.
[01:43:34.893 --> 01:43:42.038]  That people get great results from and then discount those products to you so that it becomes a total 360 win.
[01:43:42.618 --> 01:43:48.121]  And I obsess over that term that I coined years ago because that's really what I believe in.
[01:43:48.201 --> 01:43:52.784]  It's a non-zero-sum game where everybody basically benefits.
[01:43:52.844 --> 01:43:57.987]  It's beyond just symbiotic where everybody kind of works with each other and everybody makes it.
[01:43:58.268 --> 01:44:00.749]  This is where we have an even better future together.
[01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:03.251]  And so we're not robbing banks here.
[01:44:04.249 --> 01:44:07.074]  We're not engaged in criminal activity to fund our operations.
[01:44:08.464 --> 01:44:11.505]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we are engaged in good old-fashioned free market.
[01:44:11.525 --> 01:44:15.046]  It doesn't mean the whole world's free market, it doesn't mean America's perfect free market.
[01:44:15.667 --> 01:44:22.389]  We have socialism, we have communist tendencies, we have these parasitic systems nesting inside the free market capitalist system.
[01:44:22.869 --> 01:44:33.593]  But Infowars itself is a pretty much pure form of Americana free market capitalism, and your participation in it is a beautiful part of that.
[01:44:34.253 --> 01:44:35.274]  So, throughout the month,
[01:44:36.634 --> 01:44:45.920]  Of March, in the few weeks we have left, we're offering store-wide free shipping and 50% off all our best-selling supplements and a bunch of other huge specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.982]  And again, InfoWarsStore.com is the main mothership site.
[01:44:49.562 --> 01:44:52.124]  InfoWarsLife.com will take you right to the supplement pages.
[01:44:52.404 --> 01:45:02.270]  Whether it's books, videos, non-gmo heirloom seeds, t-shirts, ball caps, whatever it is, it's high quality, it spreads the word, and it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:05.432]  We're living in incredibly historic times.
[01:45:06.348 --> 01:45:07.028]  No one can deny it.
[01:45:07.789 --> 01:45:09.150]  World government's out in the open.
[01:45:09.250 --> 01:45:14.292]  They're creating animal-human hybrid clones, and it's in the back of the newspaper.
[01:45:15.113 --> 01:45:16.854]  There's open attacks on the family.
[01:45:17.494 --> 01:45:28.060]  A convicted child rapist are brought in with no background checks to teach three-year-old children in Houston public facilities how to engage in sexual activities.
[01:45:29.441 --> 01:45:33.223]  Ladies and gentlemen, humanity itself is under siege.
[01:45:34.324 --> 01:45:42.417]  It's being scientifically deployed to demoralize us, to dumb us down, to poison us, to confuse us.
[01:45:43.459 --> 01:45:45.660]  The bad news is it's highly organized and focused.
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:46:05.229]  The good news is it's so compartmentalized, there's only a few thousand globalists, corporate fascists that actually are part of the program, that if we just awaken the general masses, and we awaken those right below the technocrats, many of the functionaries, we can blow their system politically out of the water.
[01:46:05.909 --> 01:46:07.930]  But right now they're pushing more than ever.
[01:46:08.905 --> 01:46:12.747]  To preemptively silence all speech that's not corporate.
[01:46:13.368 --> 01:46:20.872]  Just today, I randomly turned on CNN and Brian Stelter was talking about how evil free speech is and how we have to ban it for everybody but CNN.
[01:46:21.172 --> 01:46:22.873]  Then I got in the car and turned on NPR.
[01:46:23.213 --> 01:46:28.056]  They were attacking me, lying about Infowars, and saying that we need to be shut down and silenced.
[01:46:29.542 --> 01:46:36.705]  That's just today when I randomly turned on the television to work out and got in my car to drive to the studio.
[01:46:37.225 --> 01:46:38.366]  That's because they're scared of you.
[01:46:38.846 --> 01:46:39.646]  They're scared of me.
[01:46:40.187 --> 01:46:41.407]  They're scared of this huge awakening.
[01:46:41.847 --> 01:46:52.012]  That's why now more than ever, when you spread the articles from NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com, when you spread those videos, when you tell your friends, your neighbors, your family about the Vermont broadcast,
[01:46:52.432 --> 01:46:57.659]  You literally break the back of the globalists politically, metaphysically, and spiritually.
[01:46:57.679 --> 01:46:58.761]  So keep taking action.
[01:46:59.181 --> 01:46:59.742]  I salute you.
[01:46:59.902 --> 01:47:01.164]  But don't let them silence you.
[01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:08.454]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:42.977 --> 01:47:52.623]  So, Gerald Cilente, Trends Forecaster, Best-Selling Author, predicted last year it's only going to get worse this year on a global scale, and it has.
[01:47:53.666 --> 01:48:07.393]  And then every time a precedent's set, YouTube does some strikes, takes some of my videos down for false reasons, that then becomes, Jones is banned from the internet, and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and thousands of publications then ask other platforms, well why is he on?
[01:48:07.453 --> 01:48:08.013]  He's banned!
[01:48:09.874 --> 01:48:15.938]  And so now the head of YouTube said, oh I agree, we took Alex Jones down, we'd like to take down
[01:48:16.926 --> 01:48:17.307]  Ben Shapiro.
[01:48:17.327 --> 01:48:18.548]  I'm going to play that clip in a few minutes.
[01:48:18.588 --> 01:48:21.412]  Gerald Slint is going to be 15 minutes with us in the next hour.
[01:48:21.932 --> 01:48:23.654]  And I've gotten so punch drunk to all this.
[01:48:25.377 --> 01:48:28.661]  I saw this article last night.
[01:48:32.205 --> 01:48:34.047]  And I never even remembered it this morning.
[01:48:35.103 --> 01:48:43.508]  Brytian, that Mike Adams runs, that carries our show, they were threatened with criminal action by the Australian government if they didn't take everything down.
[01:48:43.868 --> 01:48:50.052]  Not that we're going to block your web address, like they've done to Zero Hedge and others in New Zealand, just we're going to come after you, quote, at gunpoint.
[01:48:52.193 --> 01:48:54.514]  With international force.
[01:48:56.115 --> 01:48:59.597]  Now remember, they said they took some of our fan channels down because we showed the video.
[01:48:59.617 --> 01:49:00.358]  We didn't show the video.
[01:49:01.681 --> 01:49:02.261]  Of them in the building.
[01:49:02.662 --> 01:49:07.385]  We showed him walking around with a gun and what it said on it, and him in his car, which some other media did.
[01:49:08.826 --> 01:49:15.770]  So as Gerald said, we just suddenly have gone to the point now, you can see there's a Bruder film, you can see Nazis killing Jews, who wants to, but you know, it's historical, it's on PBS.
[01:49:16.031 --> 01:49:17.111]  So now you can't see this.
[01:49:18.072 --> 01:49:23.356]  And Susan Wojcicki, is that how you say her name?
[01:49:23.816 --> 01:49:25.437]  Everybody else is like, yay, we're gonna do it!
[01:49:26.177 --> 01:49:27.839]  So Gerald, it's like the floor fell out.
[01:49:28.139 --> 01:49:29.740]  Get into this and where you think this is going.
[01:49:31.144 --> 01:49:33.025]  Well, you know, go back.
[01:49:33.946 --> 01:49:42.772]  Those of us who are old enough to remember when the Internet really became the Internet, this was going to be the place for free speech.
[01:49:43.473 --> 01:49:44.794]  Everybody was applauding it.
[01:49:45.574 --> 01:49:47.435]  And now, of course, they're closing it down.
[01:49:47.976 --> 01:49:55.081]  And we were just talking about how you can't run Facebook curbs, anti-vaccine posts.
[01:49:57.022 --> 01:49:59.584]  Pinterest is blocking search results about
[01:50:00.026 --> 01:50:06.087]  Vaccines to protest users from misinformation.
[01:50:06.587 --> 01:50:07.727]  So they're deciding it.
[01:50:08.187 --> 01:50:09.568]  But how about this story?
[01:50:09.688 --> 01:50:11.248]  Alex just came out yesterday.
[01:50:12.848 --> 01:50:14.649]  Medical News Today reports.
[01:50:16.469 --> 01:50:19.509]  That in 2011, doctors wrote 402 million prescriptions for drugs in America.
[01:50:19.629 --> 01:50:21.050]  In the US, there are 36 million serious
[01:50:29.483 --> 01:50:32.745]  Adverse reactions to medical drugs per year.
[01:50:34.686 --> 01:50:37.128]  Over two million serious side effects.
[01:50:39.069 --> 01:50:40.871]  On and on and on and on.
[01:50:41.131 --> 01:50:43.432]  But you're not allowed to say any of this.
[01:50:43.993 --> 01:50:45.474]  Talk about being banned.
[01:50:46.234 --> 01:50:53.819]  When we put up our Trends in the News videos or our TrendVision 2020 podcasts, they get flagged.
[01:50:54.298 --> 01:51:00.001]  By Google, because I called Beto O'Rourke the White Obama.
[01:51:00.281 --> 01:51:01.301]  Can't say that.
[01:51:02.081 --> 01:51:05.303]  I can't say Economic 9-11.
[01:51:05.843 --> 01:51:06.884]  Can't say that.
[01:51:07.624 --> 01:51:10.025]  Everything is being censored.
[01:51:11.044 --> 01:51:13.965]  This is, it's a fascism that's taken over.
[01:51:14.085 --> 01:51:24.190]  And by the way, you're right, Beto O'Rourke is literally, comes from nowhere, synthetic, toxin effect voice, powered by the same people, but you mentioned it before the break, the vaccines.
[01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:31.414]  The inserts of every vaccine, no matter what it says, can kill you, can give you cancer, can cause neurological disorders, can cause seizures.
[01:51:32.094 --> 01:51:33.055]  And what do they ban?
[01:51:33.115 --> 01:51:35.578]  They go, oh, you're giving out fake medical stuff.
[01:51:36.019 --> 01:51:42.326]  Meanwhile, as you said, the OxyContin company said, we're going to addict everybody and then have a bunch of slaves we control.
[01:51:43.066 --> 01:51:50.995]  And then you've got all these other, Bayer knowingly putting HIV in the Factor VIII, all the nightmares of all these companies and all the recalls, and they're telling consumers
[01:51:51.696 --> 01:51:55.478]  People who've had their kids die, you can't go on Facebook and say your kid died.
[01:51:55.798 --> 01:52:03.121]  You can't go on Facebook and say you had a bad reaction and your daughter got paralyzed from Gardasil, or show a local news article where the doctors admit it.
[01:52:03.461 --> 01:52:04.862]  No, we call that fake news.
[01:52:04.882 --> 01:52:05.682]  This is crazy.
[01:52:06.963 --> 01:52:15.286]  Again, it's to take over what was supposed to be the free internet by the monopolies, as that Louisiana, the fool from Louisiana was saying.
[01:52:15.687 --> 01:52:21.029]  And by the way, I just want to say that in these times, where people are being censored like this,
[01:52:21.522 --> 01:52:25.804]  Do what you can to support InfoWars, everyone listening out there.
[01:52:26.164 --> 01:52:31.146]  Because if you don't, all you're going to be getting is propaganda.
[01:52:31.586 --> 01:52:33.026]  Because that's all they're feeding us.
[01:52:33.046 --> 01:52:34.547]  Let's expand on that.
[01:52:34.647 --> 01:52:35.667]  You never plug yourself.
[01:52:35.767 --> 01:52:38.528]  And I put my money where my mouth is.
[01:52:38.989 --> 01:52:47.652]  Because I love the products that InfoWars has, whether it's the filters for water,
[01:52:48.514 --> 01:52:51.817]  One of my favorites, of course, is Supermail Vitality.
[01:52:51.877 --> 01:52:52.778]  Keeps me going.
[01:52:53.178 --> 01:53:02.025]  But people have to support those of us that are putting the truth out there that we can't be bought out and sold out.
[01:53:02.425 --> 01:53:04.427]  It's only going to get worse.
[01:53:04.867 --> 01:53:06.449]  It's happening around the world.
[01:53:06.509 --> 01:53:11.833]  Again, we didn't put it up as one of our top trends for 2019 by mistake.
[01:53:12.253 --> 01:53:13.534]  And it's not only the right.
[01:53:13.794 --> 01:53:16.677]  You look what happened during the midterm elections.
[01:53:17.594 --> 01:53:19.756]  It's not, this isn't a conspiracy theory.
[01:53:19.776 --> 01:53:24.361]  Google took down, Facebook took down over 800 sites.
[01:53:24.942 --> 01:53:26.103]  And you know what they were?
[01:53:26.463 --> 01:53:28.185]  Things about police brutality.
[01:53:28.666 --> 01:53:31.789]  Things about government that they didn't like, they didn't want to hear.
[01:53:32.250 --> 01:53:35.293]  You mentioned what's going on in Australia with Zero Hedge and others.
[01:53:35.713 --> 01:53:37.275]  It's one after another.
[01:53:37.927 --> 01:53:42.390]  And then you look at Google, they were behind Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:43.851]  I'm not making that up.
[01:53:44.691 --> 01:53:46.793]  That's not a conspiracy theory.
[01:53:47.093 --> 01:53:48.714]  They were doing the algorithms for her.
[01:53:48.994 --> 01:53:50.455]  They were feeding her the information.
[01:53:50.495 --> 01:53:53.357]  That guy, who was the CEO, that left.
[01:53:54.498 --> 01:53:58.881]  He heads up Alphabet, and that of course is Eric Schmidt.
[01:53:59.921 --> 01:54:00.241]  Schmidt.
[01:54:01.041 --> 01:54:02.162]  Words out of his mouth.
[01:54:02.442 --> 01:54:05.823]  And meeting with the Clinton people when they were in Brooklyn.
[01:54:05.843 --> 01:54:12.746]  Well he said, we will deliver the election to the one who deserves it and who has the superior leadership, President Clinton.
[01:54:12.766 --> 01:54:13.986]  He called her President Clinton.
[01:54:14.507 --> 01:54:17.748]  And then they looked bad when their cheating and their meddling didn't work.
[01:54:18.068 --> 01:54:21.709]  So they had to call an American grassroots movement Russian, which is asinine.
[01:54:22.970 --> 01:54:26.051]  Yeah, and I think you spelled Schmidt wrong.
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:29.541]  Well, you said it wrong.
[01:54:29.841 --> 01:54:33.684]  Because this has an S-H and you could get rid of some of those other letters in the middle.
[01:54:33.704 --> 01:54:34.565]  Exactly.
[01:54:34.585 --> 01:54:35.706]  Because that's all they are.
[01:54:36.286 --> 01:54:37.347]  You know what Google did to me?
[01:54:37.667 --> 01:54:48.695]  You remember when I had to take them to the New York, the Federal District Court in New York, it became a federal case because there were fake Gerald Cilenti websites out there that they wouldn't take down.
[01:54:49.095 --> 01:54:52.398]  Cost me over a hundred, almost a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
[01:54:53.198 --> 01:54:53.719]  Guess what?
[01:54:54.468 --> 01:54:57.409]  There are new fake Gerald Cilenti websites out there.
[01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:59.010]  I won the case.
[01:54:59.771 --> 01:55:01.892]  It was a federal district court case.
[01:55:02.472 --> 01:55:04.513]  It's there for everybody to look at.
[01:55:05.673 --> 01:55:08.675]  They refuse to take the new fake sites down.
[01:55:09.795 --> 01:55:11.096]  They won't take them down.
[01:55:11.116 --> 01:55:15.238]  And it's because of the same reason that they do to you.
[01:55:15.942 --> 01:55:27.106]  They censor me, they put fake Celenti information up there so people could attack me, and after taking them to court, winning it, they refuse to take it down.
[01:55:31.383 --> 01:55:32.623]  What do you expect to happen now?
[01:55:32.724 --> 01:55:36.685]  Because the so-called left worldwide is quarterbacking all this authoritarianism.
[01:55:37.325 --> 01:55:39.546]  Populists and nationalists are trying to resist it.
[01:55:39.566 --> 01:55:40.707]  Trump's starting to do something.
[01:55:40.727 --> 01:55:43.768]  But it's just, they're so arrogant.
[01:55:43.948 --> 01:55:44.988]  They're so entitled.
[01:55:45.668 --> 01:55:53.031]  When we come back, I'm going to play this clip of the CEO of YouTube admitting that she wants to ban basically even mainline conservatives.
[01:55:53.051 --> 01:55:55.192]  I mean, this is just open authoritarianism.
[01:55:56.488 --> 01:55:56.788]  It is.
[01:55:57.389 --> 01:55:59.832]  And again, you know, it's been coming along.
[01:55:59.892 --> 01:56:01.795]  We've been seeing it and talking about it.
[01:56:02.416 --> 01:56:10.506]  And, you know, again, that's why I'm saying to people, do what you can to buy the products from InfoWars to keep this going.
[01:56:10.916 --> 01:56:15.597]  You know, people say to me, you know, I'm on Alex Jones, I say what I want to say.
[01:56:15.877 --> 01:56:17.237]  Don't tell me what to do.
[01:56:17.317 --> 01:56:20.118]  I'll go anywhere I want to go and do anything I want to do.
[01:56:20.158 --> 01:56:21.739]  I've been on Alex a long time.
[01:56:22.039 --> 01:56:23.279]  I say what I want to say.
[01:56:23.299 --> 01:56:25.199]  I agree with a lot of what he says.
[01:56:25.459 --> 01:56:27.020]  We don't have to agree on everything.
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:28.400]  He doesn't have to agree with me.
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:30.200]  It's freedom of speech.
[01:56:30.341 --> 01:56:31.441]  Because we're not in a cult.
[01:56:31.481 --> 01:56:32.161]  We're not in a cult.
[01:56:32.541 --> 01:56:36.404]  And I love how everybody tries to police everybody and tell them who to talk to and what to do.
[01:56:36.844 --> 01:56:37.304]  Exactly.
[01:56:37.344 --> 01:56:38.325]  These are busybodies.
[01:56:38.365 --> 01:56:38.905]  They're sick.
[01:56:39.686 --> 01:56:40.546]  They're out of control.
[01:56:40.586 --> 01:56:41.907]  By the way, you never plug yourself.
[01:56:42.408 --> 01:56:48.832]  The power of people physically getting your magazine and after they read it, leaving it at the dental office or at the library or at the college.
[01:56:48.912 --> 01:56:50.293]  That's how you change the world.
[01:56:50.633 --> 01:56:54.836]  And now more than ever with the censorship, hard copies like your great magazine are precious.
[01:56:55.116 --> 01:56:57.758]  Tell folks how they get a subscription to the Trends Research.
[01:56:57.778 --> 01:56:59.059]  I know it's TrendsResearch.com.
[01:56:59.339 --> 01:57:00.620]  They can sign up for news alerts as well.
[01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:02.281]  That's right.
[01:57:05.396 --> 01:57:07.277]  And his Skype just broke up.
[01:57:07.578 --> 01:57:10.159]  Just go to TrendsResearch.com.
[01:57:10.659 --> 01:57:11.260]  Gerald, are you back?
[01:57:12.401 --> 01:57:12.561]  Yep.
[01:57:12.881 --> 01:57:13.221]  Okay, good.
[01:57:13.261 --> 01:57:14.302]  Sorry, you broke up there for a minute.
[01:57:14.322 --> 01:57:16.463]  Go ahead and tell us the easiest way to subscribe.
[01:57:17.624 --> 01:57:20.466]  Just TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com.
[01:57:20.726 --> 01:57:23.768]  The new edition's just out, and you should see the cover.
[01:57:24.505 --> 01:57:25.005]  It's time.
[01:57:58.490 --> 01:58:03.814]  This is the Save the First Amendment, Stop Big Tech, Stop the Bias 50-hour broadcast.
[01:58:03.854 --> 01:58:06.676]  We've got everybody from Laura Loomer to Tommy Robinson joining us.
[01:58:06.816 --> 01:58:10.538]  I believe Joe said he could do it, but Joe is famously busy, okay?
[01:58:10.558 --> 01:58:11.679]  But regardless, I'm going to interview with him.
[01:58:11.779 --> 01:58:12.440]  He's coming to town.
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:14.001]  And there's a bunch of other surprise guests.
[01:58:14.141 --> 01:58:15.141]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:58:15.261 --> 01:58:21.706]  From now right through Saturday morning, 10 a.m., focal point on free speech and a focal point on what we're fighting and what the stakes are.
[01:58:21.946 --> 01:58:24.287]  Please don't forget, store-wide free shipping right now.

[01:58:43.236 --> 01:58:46.700]  It's a supplement and double pay for your points and free shipping for a while.
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:53.709]  And you fund an operation where we get up here and fight the pedophiles and fight people openly saying we're gonna kill babies after they're born and sell their goodies.
[01:58:53.729 --> 01:58:55.411]  Because they want their goodies.
[01:58:56.412 --> 01:58:57.393]  Hell, I mean the pedophiles...
[01:58:58.414 --> 01:58:59.695]  I guess just rape the kids.
[01:58:59.735 --> 01:59:01.255]  These folks want to kill them better than they ever did.
[01:59:01.555 --> 01:59:02.215]  Sell their goods.
[01:59:03.256 --> 01:59:04.056]  Sell their innards.
[01:59:04.216 --> 01:59:06.637]  Sell what the womb God created, made.
[01:59:06.817 --> 01:59:08.057]  They just think we're going to take it.
[01:59:08.097 --> 01:59:09.378]  Well, some of us aren't going to take it.
[01:59:09.478 --> 01:59:17.300]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, humanize these babies and give them at least as much value as the governor who, when he's not wearing a KKK outfit, is a blackface.
[01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:18.101]  Totally evil.
[01:59:18.141 --> 01:59:20.261]  These innocent little children suffer little children under me.
[01:59:20.361 --> 01:59:22.582]  Better for someone to throw themselves in the deepest ocean with a giant
[01:59:25.003 --> 01:59:27.624]  I'm proud of what we've done together.
[01:59:27.765 --> 01:59:29.725]  You, the audience, are the InfoWar.
[01:59:30.286 --> 01:59:31.286]  I'm not just saying that.

[01:59:49.275 --> 01:59:50.676]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:59:50.696 --> 01:59:51.216]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:57.092 --> 02:00:01.035]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:01.235 --> 02:00:02.957]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[02:00:03.117 --> 02:00:06.900]  I'm a friend of thunder.
[02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:09.421]  Friend as in any wonder, lightning strikes me.
[02:00:09.481 --> 02:00:11.483]  I fought with the devil.
[02:00:28.706 --> 02:00:31.727]  I got down on his level.
[02:00:33.948 --> 02:00:35.429]  So he gave up on me.
[02:00:35.489 --> 02:00:38.070]  Yeah, I'm no stranger to the rain.
[02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:50.235]  Jones only has our guest for two more segments.
[02:00:50.795 --> 02:00:52.116]  I got some other news after he leaves us.
[02:00:52.736 --> 02:00:53.737]  I may even do it while he's with us.
[02:00:53.797 --> 02:00:54.777]  It's just so insane.
[02:00:54.957 --> 02:00:56.218]  We knew it was coming, but it's here.
[02:00:57.461 --> 02:01:03.903]  Foreign governments ordering content taken down here and saying, we're working with your government to shut you down if you don't.
[02:01:04.903 --> 02:01:07.824]  And then meanwhile, they can show it on mainstream news, but you can't.
[02:01:08.504 --> 02:01:10.824]  It's the total death of any due process, anything.
[02:01:11.344 --> 02:01:22.167]  Here is Susan Wojcicki, if I'm pronouncing that right, the CEO of YouTube, with Kara Swisher at the Lesbians in Tech Conference in San Francisco.
[02:01:22.987 --> 02:01:25.768]  And here she is, and they're talking about, hey, my son's looking at this video.
[02:01:26.750 --> 02:01:28.272]  I don't like him being able to see these people.
[02:01:28.292 --> 02:01:29.973]  He took Alex Jones off, take him off.
[02:01:30.174 --> 02:01:31.315]  She's like, well, I'd really like to.
[02:01:32.336 --> 02:01:34.958]  So they're admitting that they disagree with our politics.
[02:01:35.239 --> 02:01:37.581]  It's not about whatever reason they make up.
[02:01:38.122 --> 02:01:40.204]  Like that I beat up a kid, and then it's not even true.
[02:01:40.224 --> 02:01:41.805]  That's how YouTube took me down.
[02:01:42.466 --> 02:01:43.427]  It's just the arrogance.
[02:01:44.188 --> 02:01:46.590]  It's like royalty up in Cloud City.
[02:01:46.830 --> 02:01:47.151]  Here it is.
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:56.343]  My son, who's 13 years old, started watching Ben Shapiro videos, and he's like the gateway drug to the next group.
[02:01:56.383 --> 02:02:00.744]  And then it goes right to Jordan Peterson, and then it goes down, and in three clicks, he was at neo-Nazi stuff.
[02:02:01.164 --> 02:02:03.725]  It was like astonishing, and then I had to listen to it at dinner.
[02:02:04.365 --> 02:02:06.746]  And I was sort of like, I'm gonna kill Susan Wojcicki first.
[02:02:06.826 --> 02:02:08.927]  Okay, well, here I am.
[02:02:09.407 --> 02:02:24.214]  But it was sort of like, I was sort of like, is there anything, like, it feels like, as I said, I think you've heard me say this, it feels like all you tech companies have built cities, these beautiful cities, but you decided not to initially put in police, fire,
[02:02:24.934 --> 02:02:34.921]  And her brain damage behind the Nazi stuff are probably clips of Tucker Carlson or PewDiePie!
[02:02:41.725 --> 02:02:43.126]  He's clever, but he's an idiot.
[02:02:43.166 --> 02:02:45.107]  Anyway, it's just like, it's exhausting.
[02:02:45.287 --> 02:02:47.089]  But it has like a huge effect on them.
[02:02:47.449 --> 02:02:58.255]  Do you feel like the people, like on a bigger thing, and it's not your total responsibility, Susan, but it's, do you feel like the people still have a sense of this, of the impact they have?
[02:02:58.516 --> 02:02:59.916]  So, getting to your son.
[02:02:59.936 --> 02:03:01.277]  He's lost.
[02:03:01.858 --> 02:03:04.699]  No, we can work on your son here.
[02:03:04.799 --> 02:03:08.542]  I have a son too, and I get some of these discussions also at the dinner table.
[02:03:09.102 --> 02:03:23.925]  I mean, so... She just said that her 13-year-old son was lost because he's not a social justice warrior, and he's looking up conservative videos on YouTube, and maybe looking to Jordan Peterson as a father figure because he's being raised by two lesbians.
[02:03:25.365 --> 02:03:32.566]  And again, they go on to say, that's not the exact clip I wanted to play, but, you know, they say, we got Alex Jones off, why can't we get him off?
[02:03:32.606 --> 02:03:33.666]  And she says, well, I'd like to.
[02:03:34.386 --> 02:03:35.287]  We got part of that in there.
[02:03:35.587 --> 02:03:37.647]  These are just outrageous statements, Gerald.
[02:03:40.035 --> 02:03:41.576]  They are in the arrogance.
[02:03:42.016 --> 02:03:43.237]  Oh, you built the cities.
[02:03:43.517 --> 02:03:47.139]  You know, San Francisco wasn't there before tech came there.
[02:03:47.439 --> 02:03:48.640]  No, they just found it.
[02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:49.641]  They just built it.
[02:03:50.161 --> 02:03:52.122]  You know what the arrogance of these people are?
[02:03:52.622 --> 02:04:00.247]  That they accept the lies and BS from the political whores that they believe in.
[02:04:00.747 --> 02:04:05.170]  And I bring that into men and women to make it really clear.
[02:04:05.190 --> 02:04:07.551]  Hey, you know, I'm going to tell you something, Alex.
[02:04:09.389 --> 02:04:13.731]  Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction, and he has to go.
[02:04:14.311 --> 02:04:15.791]  I gotta tell you something, Alex.
[02:04:16.212 --> 02:04:17.872]  I'm Barack B.S.
[02:04:18.552 --> 02:04:20.853]  Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner.
[02:04:21.354 --> 02:04:23.154]  That Assad has to go.
[02:04:23.694 --> 02:04:26.816]  We're gonna destroy the richest country in Africa.
[02:04:27.256 --> 02:04:35.559]  We're gonna kill and give the weaponry to the Shiite ISIS that are destroying so much.
[02:04:36.277 --> 02:04:40.500]  But Obama says it, it's cool with these hypocrites.
[02:04:41.401 --> 02:04:45.964]  But when you come out against it, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:04:46.564 --> 02:04:49.006]  They gobble up conspiracy.
[02:04:49.746 --> 02:04:50.407]  It's crazy.
[02:04:50.467 --> 02:04:50.907]  Stay there.
[02:04:50.927 --> 02:04:53.289]  Gerald Celente back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:53.309 --> 02:04:58.352]  We're going to get into the hypocrisy straight ahead and then I'm going to play the whole Mark Dice piece with the whole thing in context.
[02:04:58.372 --> 02:04:59.233]  We're just going to play the whole thing.
[02:05:03.348 --> 02:05:07.972]  The globalists, the eugenicists are always talking down to us.
[02:05:08.733 --> 02:05:12.557]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[02:05:12.977 --> 02:05:20.024]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[02:05:20.924 --> 02:05:23.146]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[02:05:24.047 --> 02:05:27.530]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[02:05:28.856 --> 02:05:31.818]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[02:05:31.998 --> 02:05:33.539]  We are the power structure.
[02:05:34.039 --> 02:05:35.059]  We are the inventors.
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:36.680]  We are the trailblazers.
[02:05:37.421 --> 02:05:40.222]  And the globalists understand that.
[02:05:40.802 --> 02:05:46.765]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[02:05:47.926 --> 02:05:51.728]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[02:05:52.779 --> 02:06:03.281]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at Inforestore.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[02:06:03.301 --> 02:06:11.243]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:11.323 --> 02:06:14.643]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:15.244 --> 02:06:21.325]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:25.757 --> 02:06:27.398]  I want something to sink in out there.
[02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:31.081]  Think about how corporate media always frames us.
[02:06:33.102 --> 02:06:45.851]  If you question the chemical attacks in Syria, where even the UN and our own government admits three of the four attacks were staged by ISIS to try to bring the U.S.
[02:06:45.891 --> 02:06:47.633]  into the war to overturn Assad.
[02:06:48.133 --> 02:06:50.615]  Funny, they had the motive, they had the chemicals, and they're so lazy
[02:06:52.793 --> 02:07:00.236]  Not even lazy, they shot videos of themselves launching the attack, screaming Allah Akbar, because that makes them rock stars in the Middle East and the Islamic world.
[02:07:02.116 --> 02:07:12.800]  And then when Ron Paul came out against it a few years ago and said it was fake, and mentioned the UN report and our own report, they called him a Russian agent in a congressional report along with me.
[02:07:13.540 --> 02:07:20.343]  They said, well, Russian operatives like Ron Paul and Alex Jones, they get their marching orders from the Kremlin.
[02:07:21.795 --> 02:07:35.860]  I had Jack Posobiec, who's not just your average intelligence guy, he's been deep in China, deep in all over the place, heavily hooked up with the White House, did a great analysis of this last hour, and he said, China has a thousand times the infiltration Russia does.
[02:07:36.681 --> 02:07:38.241]  Russia is the biggest country in the world.
[02:07:38.641 --> 02:07:40.862]  They don't have electricity in many areas.
[02:07:41.363 --> 02:07:45.104]  They don't have, it's not that they're bad people, it's that it's so big!
[02:07:46.404 --> 02:07:47.485]  It's so gigantic!
[02:07:47.865 --> 02:07:48.745]  Imagine if the U.S.
[02:07:48.765 --> 02:07:50.146]  was three times the size it was.
[02:07:51.563 --> 02:07:53.484]  Most areas of the West we haven't even developed yet.
[02:07:55.264 --> 02:07:58.005]  Russia's almost, what is it, almost four times bigger?
[02:08:00.926 --> 02:08:06.187]  They're super rich with their resources and everything, but they are not expansionist.
[02:08:07.168 --> 02:08:11.509]  When the American globalist left took over Russia, they used it as an expansionist system.
[02:08:12.429 --> 02:08:13.869]  And I'm not defending Russia.
[02:08:14.250 --> 02:08:19.091]  The point is, is that our elite are allied with China, they're censoring the hell out of us,
[02:08:20.751 --> 02:08:27.514]  And then, it's consumers' rights to say, I took a vaccine and it hurt me, or my kid took it and got sick.
[02:08:27.674 --> 02:08:29.095]  They have a vaccine damage fund, they admit it.
[02:08:29.295 --> 02:08:29.996]  It's on the inserts.
[02:08:30.196 --> 02:08:31.917]  Or you have a right to say I had a bad interaction.
[02:08:32.517 --> 02:08:42.022]  But if you go complain on Facebook or Twitter, you say, hey, look out, my 18-month-old son got his third round of shots, he quit talking, and now sits in the corner crapping all over himself.
[02:08:42.582 --> 02:08:46.264]  You talk about autism, one from one in 35,000 to one in 58 in the last 30 years, they shut your ass down!
[02:08:50.302 --> 02:08:51.983]  Because we're reaching a critical mass.
[02:08:52.003 --> 02:08:54.604]  They're saying you don't have a right to have consumer reports.
[02:08:54.684 --> 02:08:55.905]  You don't have a right to comment.
[02:08:56.746 --> 02:08:59.867]  You don't have a right to say what you think, whether you're right or wrong.
[02:09:01.208 --> 02:09:03.790]  Then they misconstrue who you are and what you're saying.
[02:09:04.650 --> 02:09:10.854]  Their latest thing is they have troll bots going to harass moms whose kids have gotten sick from vaccines and then say that anti-vaxxers are saying it.
[02:09:11.054 --> 02:09:12.114]  I'm not anti-science.
[02:09:12.555 --> 02:09:14.556]  It's that these companies have liability protection.
[02:09:16.097 --> 02:09:18.198]  They're talking about giving it to all the drug companies now.
[02:09:19.864 --> 02:09:21.306]  That's something Trump's doing that's good.
[02:09:21.326 --> 02:09:26.413]  Gerald, you tried to get into this earlier and you mentioned it and we kind of got out of it, but all over the news here.
[02:09:27.605 --> 02:09:29.586]  They're just banning, criticizing vaccines, period.
[02:09:29.626 --> 02:09:33.728]  Like you said, if people thought the censorship was bad, we went off some cliff.
[02:09:34.449 --> 02:09:40.332]  So I want you to get into that and give us your expert view, the possible futures, and what we should do to counter it.
[02:09:40.352 --> 02:09:42.973]  Because, I mean, it's going so headlong, so fast.
[02:09:43.033 --> 02:09:44.434]  Is this ahead of some new war?
[02:09:44.774 --> 02:09:45.595]  Or some big event?
[02:09:45.955 --> 02:09:47.016]  Or Trump's assassination?
[02:09:47.036 --> 02:09:50.437]  Because, as you said, there is no bottom now to censorship.
[02:09:50.517 --> 02:09:53.099]  It's just, it's now gone to light speed.
[02:09:54.940 --> 02:10:04.164]  You know, they call the people socialists in the Democratic Party that are all in favor of more of this and have made it happen.
[02:10:04.464 --> 02:10:05.944]  How about calling them fascists?
[02:10:06.484 --> 02:10:08.245]  Because that's what this is.
[02:10:08.865 --> 02:10:10.966]  This is fascism that's taking over.
[02:10:11.646 --> 02:10:16.889]  You know, when you think of the word politically correct, I tell people to look up the definition of a politician.
[02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:23.091]  Someone that's manipulative and devious, typically to gain advancement within an organization.
[02:10:23.809 --> 02:10:28.693]  You mentioned about what was going on in Syria with the phony chemical attacks.
[02:10:29.433 --> 02:10:40.861]  There was a reporter, I believe it was either the BBC or The Guardian, that has proof that it was the White Helmets that pulled that stunt off.
[02:10:42.502 --> 02:10:47.226]  Not in the news, that arrogant woman that you played that clip from before,
[02:10:48.283 --> 02:10:58.186]  Telling, you know, that what great people the geeks are, and all that the geeks have given us, these passionate little people, the Suckerbergs.
[02:10:58.586 --> 02:11:01.686]  You know, from Suckerberg to Jobs.
[02:11:02.027 --> 02:11:03.267]  You look at these guys.
[02:11:03.667 --> 02:11:06.288]  Not an ounce of boogie, not a drop of jive.
[02:11:06.568 --> 02:11:11.469]  The only thing that changed is the color of their t-shirts from black to blue.
[02:11:12.424 --> 02:11:14.987]  And you can't say anything about them.
[02:11:15.007 --> 02:11:17.589]  The geeks are going to tell you what to think.
[02:11:17.989 --> 02:11:19.230]  So let's go back.
[02:11:20.392 --> 02:11:22.894]  Let's go back to what you said.
[02:11:23.755 --> 02:11:25.977]  We have to believe a lemon.
[02:11:26.787 --> 02:11:36.109]  We have to believe a little Anderson Cooper, a nobody, if his mama wasn't Gloria Vanderbilt.
[02:11:36.650 --> 02:11:45.012]  Hey, how about arrogant little Cuomo, another guy like his brother over there, Andy, that
[02:11:46.432 --> 02:11:50.474]  Thought they hit a home run because they were born on third base.
[02:11:51.155 --> 02:11:53.496]  Guys, that would be nowhere.
[02:11:53.916 --> 02:11:56.278]  We gotta listen to them.
[02:11:56.298 --> 02:12:02.841]  Yeah, you gotta listen to the sellouts, the suck-ups, and the prostitutes.
[02:12:03.262 --> 02:12:11.286]  The people that get paid to put out by their Corporate Johns and their Washington Whoremasters.
[02:12:11.806 --> 02:12:12.527]  Oh, by the way,
[02:12:13.237 --> 02:12:27.164]  I'm sorry for raising my voice and feeling my passion, but I also have to blame you, Alex Jones, and InfoWars, because I took a shot of male vitality, super male vitality, and it got me to go.
[02:12:27.184 --> 02:12:36.229]  Well, you're nice to say that, because you were a lobbyist, you were a best-selling author, you had a long career, and you're also an expert in martial arts.
[02:12:36.509 --> 02:12:38.290]  Aren't you also an expert in herbs or something?
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:40.982]  It's me and Ronald Reagan over here.
[02:12:41.022 --> 02:12:42.103]  I'm 30 years old.
[02:12:42.543 --> 02:12:44.105]  I was with him for an hour and a half.
[02:12:45.126 --> 02:12:49.210]  I picked him up at the Hilton Hotel when I used to work for the chemical industry.
[02:12:49.470 --> 02:12:51.792]  He's a speaker at the Chicago Hilton.
[02:12:51.812 --> 02:12:52.353]  I picked him up.
[02:12:52.633 --> 02:12:56.337]  We're going to... No, no, you've been around the block, but don't you also have a degree or something?
[02:12:56.437 --> 02:12:57.698]  You're like an herb expert, right?
[02:12:58.848 --> 02:13:08.015]  Well, I have an honorary doctor of law from the National University of Health Sciences, so the work I've done in complementary and integrated medicine.
[02:13:08.035 --> 02:13:10.877]  So it means a lot to me that you like our supplements, but that's what we got.
[02:13:10.897 --> 02:13:12.258]  Oh yeah!
[02:13:12.738 --> 02:13:17.542]  Alex, the first book I worked on was a big Warner book, Natural Healing.
[02:13:18.683 --> 02:13:20.084]  So I know about this stuff.
[02:13:20.104 --> 02:13:22.746]  You know, I'm 72 years old, I stay in shape.
[02:13:22.766 --> 02:13:24.487]  You don't look like you're 70, I need to do what you're doing.
[02:13:25.546 --> 02:13:31.029]  But again, so that's why I support your products, because of what they do and how they help me.
[02:13:31.490 --> 02:13:33.511]  I wouldn't say this if I didn't believe it.
[02:13:33.531 --> 02:13:35.392]  No, I totally understand and we really appreciate that.
[02:13:36.373 --> 02:13:43.497]  Gerald, I want to play this clip since you mentioned that we played a different part earlier, but here's the clips where she's specifically saying, I called for Alex Jones to be banned, and you did.
[02:13:43.597 --> 02:13:45.238]  Now ban Ben Shapiro.
[02:13:45.318 --> 02:13:46.539]  And again, Ben has his own problems.
[02:13:46.559 --> 02:13:47.580]  He can be a good guy or a bad guy.
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:49.101]  He is mainline.
[02:13:49.321 --> 02:13:51.682]  So they just want everybody they don't like off the air.
[02:13:52.823 --> 02:13:54.464]  Here's the CEO of YouTube.
[02:13:55.755 --> 02:13:58.456]  Two, look, there's a set of content that has to meet the community guidelines.
[02:13:58.516 --> 02:14:00.496]  Ben Shapiro's gonna meet the community guidelines.
[02:14:00.536 --> 02:14:03.717]  So I don't think you're suggesting that we remove him from the platform, are you?
[02:14:04.237 --> 02:14:05.278]  I would, but I can't.
[02:14:05.298 --> 02:14:05.618]  No, no.
[02:14:05.638 --> 02:14:06.358]  Okay, okay.
[02:14:06.418 --> 02:14:06.938]  But you know what?
[02:14:07.018 --> 02:14:13.420]  But no, you know, like, last time I saw you, I was like, get Alex Jones off that platform, and you're like, well, the community guidelines, and then you got him off.
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:14.440]  No, he's not on the platform.
[02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:17.461]  I know, so I was right, but that's just, that's enough.
[02:14:17.501 --> 02:14:23.503]  So, she's on a stage in front of a bunch of women, laughing and giggling about taking me off the air, Gerald.
[02:14:25.123 --> 02:14:26.883]  I mean, if they don't like it, I'll listen to you.
[02:14:27.183 --> 02:14:28.964]  This is supposed to be the Internet.
[02:14:29.244 --> 02:14:30.664]  This was supposed to be free.
[02:14:30.744 --> 02:14:45.667]  I'm telling you, the people that are our... the people that remember that were old enough, when the whole Internet revolution began, the purpose of it was that you could see and hear what you wanted to, and no one would censor you.
[02:14:45.987 --> 02:14:48.207]  And now it's total censorship.
[02:14:48.567 --> 02:14:50.167]  The fascists own it.
[02:14:50.468 --> 02:14:51.608]  The monopolies.
[02:14:51.628 --> 02:14:53.068]  The Googles.
[02:14:53.618 --> 02:14:57.462]  The Facebooks, the Twitters, all of them.
[02:14:57.782 --> 02:15:05.669]  We are controlled by fascist monopolies that are telling us how to live, what to do, and to obey orders.
[02:15:05.929 --> 02:15:15.618]  What would you say, in closing, is the Internet's not just been neutered, it's being butchered and dismembered and harvested, and it's turning into a glorified Netflix in front of our own eyeballs.
[02:15:15.638 --> 02:15:17.019]  I mean, what would you call this?
[02:15:17.239 --> 02:15:19.842]  The death, not just of free speech, but of the real Internet?
[02:15:21.112 --> 02:15:21.692]  Oh, it is!
[02:15:22.412 --> 02:15:23.893]  I'm telling you what's happening to me!
[02:15:23.913 --> 02:15:26.294]  I can't say anything bad.
[02:15:26.314 --> 02:15:31.555]  Again, I call the white Obama, white Obama, and I'm not allowed to say that?
[02:15:31.875 --> 02:15:33.456]  What do I got, some little clown?
[02:15:33.996 --> 02:15:36.156]  Telling me what I can say and what I can't?
[02:15:36.677 --> 02:15:40.918]  That they're deciding for me how I should have freedom of speech?
[02:15:41.378 --> 02:15:42.578]  And that's the big issue.
[02:15:43.078 --> 02:15:48.220]  Because when you lose freedom of speech, you lose your right to be an American.
[02:15:49.261 --> 02:15:49.781]  No, you're right.
[02:15:49.801 --> 02:15:52.822]  I mean, they're just... A lot of people fought and died for these rights, and they're just being pissed away.
[02:15:53.102 --> 02:15:54.022]  Gerald, I salute you.
[02:15:54.062 --> 02:15:54.623]  God bless.
[02:15:54.923 --> 02:15:55.543]  You're amazing.
[02:15:55.723 --> 02:15:56.943]  General Salente on Twitter.
[02:15:56.963 --> 02:15:58.024]  We'll talk to you soon, my friend.
[02:15:58.624 --> 02:15:58.884]  Thank you.
[02:15:58.904 --> 02:15:59.824]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:59.844 --> 02:16:02.565]  Stay with us.
[02:16:03.105 --> 02:16:05.386]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[02:16:06.006 --> 02:16:07.506]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[02:16:08.006 --> 02:16:09.547]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[02:16:10.916 --> 02:16:13.798]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[02:16:14.239 --> 02:16:16.820]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[02:16:17.341 --> 02:16:18.542]  I didn't invent all this.
[02:16:18.902 --> 02:16:24.906]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[02:16:25.467 --> 02:16:28.269]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[02:16:29.332 --> 02:16:32.373]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[02:16:32.673 --> 02:16:36.835]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[02:16:37.295 --> 02:16:50.561]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[02:16:50.821 --> 02:16:52.762]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[02:16:53.402 --> 02:16:58.249]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[02:16:58.670 --> 02:17:01.114]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[02:17:02.421 --> 02:17:07.843]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[02:18:07.699 --> 02:18:15.261]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:18:16.261 --> 02:18:18.842]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:18:19.262 --> 02:18:20.602]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:18:20.982 --> 02:18:27.264]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[02:18:29.364 --> 02:18:34.266]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[02:18:34.686 --> 02:18:37.587]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:18:37.647 --> 02:18:41.249]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:18:41.569 --> 02:18:45.130]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:18:45.550 --> 02:18:47.251]  I've got two in my home.
[02:18:47.371 --> 02:18:52.993]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[02:18:53.473 --> 02:18:54.314]  Don't live
[02:18:55.134 --> 02:18:58.856]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[02:18:59.216 --> 02:19:00.477]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:00.677 --> 02:19:07.400]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.

[02:19:13.083 --> 02:19:14.344]  Free shipping storewide.

[02:19:50.351 --> 02:19:51.312]  Voting with our dollars.
[02:19:51.332 --> 02:19:52.613]  Voting with our mouths.
[02:19:52.813 --> 02:19:53.653]  Voting with our speech.
[02:19:54.273 --> 02:19:55.534]  Voting with our action.
[02:19:55.554 --> 02:19:56.815]  Free shipping storewide.

[02:19:59.016 --> 02:20:01.337]  Free shipping storewide at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:20:06.300 --> 02:20:08.941]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:26.631 --> 02:20:30.773]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:20:31.513 --> 02:20:40.437]  It's Alex Jones live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:20:44.865 --> 02:20:51.469]  One time I was going about 180 miles an hour listening to this song, by myself, on a very lonely, stretchy highway.
[02:20:52.390 --> 02:20:54.031]  And I drove the whole song at about 180.
[02:20:54.531 --> 02:20:54.992]  Crank it up.
[02:21:00.095 --> 02:21:01.876]  I'd have tried that, too.
[02:21:01.956 --> 02:21:02.497]  I'd really do that.
[02:21:02.517 --> 02:21:04.158]  I don't do anything extreme.
[02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:13.704]  I'm stuffed, though, and those telephone poles are going...
[02:21:14.642 --> 02:21:15.082]  Crank it up!
[02:21:23.864 --> 02:21:32.987]  I'm gonna say this right now to not brag about the show but to quantify something so that people really get this and I know you get it.
[02:21:34.747 --> 02:21:42.009]  But we went to number one in news and we're gonna go total number one in a few months of all Apple apps and they just banned us.
[02:21:44.491 --> 02:21:45.911]  And it's happened everywhere else.
[02:21:45.951 --> 02:21:47.532]  This broadcast is not perfect.
[02:21:47.852 --> 02:21:48.932]  People are hungry for the truth, though.
[02:21:48.972 --> 02:21:50.573]  It shows freedom is popular.
[02:21:51.073 --> 02:21:52.153]  This show is just a gauge.
[02:21:53.954 --> 02:21:55.014]  Because you're this show.
[02:21:55.394 --> 02:21:57.635]  You're more this show than almost anything else out there.
[02:21:57.655 --> 02:21:58.455]  This is what you want.
[02:21:58.515 --> 02:21:59.296]  This is what you are.
[02:21:59.416 --> 02:22:00.176]  I'm just like you.
[02:22:03.117 --> 02:22:04.997]  And so, they put us on cloud TV a few months ago.
[02:22:05.017 --> 02:22:05.778]  It's been around for years.
[02:22:05.798 --> 02:22:06.978]  It's one of the bigger services.
[02:22:07.518 --> 02:22:08.178]  It's a good service.
[02:22:08.558 --> 02:22:09.019]  They correct me.
[02:22:09.059 --> 02:22:13.300]  They've got hundreds of channels, thousands of programs,
[02:22:14.568 --> 02:22:15.489]  And we're number one.
[02:22:18.190 --> 02:22:18.911]  Because you took action.
[02:22:18.931 --> 02:22:19.811]  Because you're number one.
[02:22:20.451 --> 02:22:21.672]  And it's the same thing over and over again.
[02:22:21.992 --> 02:22:23.653]  So that's why we got Trump elected.
[02:22:24.054 --> 02:22:24.854]  You got Trump elected.
[02:22:24.874 --> 02:22:25.875]  We're having all these victories.
[02:22:25.915 --> 02:22:27.456]  They can't let us celebrate that.
[02:22:27.816 --> 02:22:31.838]  That's why they got to make us the bad guys or the racist or all this crap.
[02:22:33.159 --> 02:22:34.680]  Because the truth is we just want to live in peace.
[02:22:35.761 --> 02:22:37.201]  Everybody loves red-blooded Americans.
[02:22:37.221 --> 02:22:39.243]  We've all got red blood no matter where we're from around the planet.
[02:22:40.223 --> 02:22:41.364]  And the globalists are a joke.
[02:22:42.944 --> 02:22:45.925]  They have to pay to put CNN on in the hotels and the bars.
[02:22:46.285 --> 02:22:48.046]  They have to pay to put it in the public schools.
[02:22:48.446 --> 02:22:49.186]  It's a joke!
[02:22:49.687 --> 02:22:53.068]  And they're all a bunch of rich billionaire kids who want to be somebody.
[02:22:53.088 --> 02:22:54.328]  It's a joke!
[02:22:56.069 --> 02:22:58.730]  Now, I don't ever play a report twice in two days.
[02:22:58.750 --> 02:22:59.831]  Rarely.
[02:23:01.254 --> 02:23:13.611]  But this Mark Dice piece is incredible because this is the top Silicon Valley reporter, Tara Swisher, with the CEO of YouTube, admitting they're censoring everybody because they don't like their views, and then they lie to Congress.
[02:23:13.992 --> 02:23:15.674]  This is bombshell.
[02:23:16.015 --> 02:23:16.896]  Let's play the report.
[02:23:18.089 --> 02:23:24.534]  First, they came for Alex Jones, and a lot of people thought, he's said some crazy things and he's kind of on the fringe.
[02:23:24.934 --> 02:23:28.277]  They certainly won't censor any mainstream conservatives.
[02:23:28.537 --> 02:23:31.559]  Well, I've been trying to tell you that he was just the beginning.
[02:23:31.639 --> 02:23:36.363]  YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki recently sat down for an interview with Kara Swisher.
[02:23:36.383 --> 02:23:40.346]  If you're not familiar with her name, I'm sure that you've seen some of her interviews.
[02:23:40.766 --> 02:23:47.851]  She was the one who did that interview with Mark Zuckerberg when he was sweating profusely when she brought up some of the privacy concerns.
[02:23:48.011 --> 02:23:54.936]  She also scored that historic interview with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and has interviewed all of the big names in tech.
[02:23:55.236 --> 02:24:10.127]  And at this year's Lesbians Who Tech conference in San Francisco, Kara Swisher pressured YouTube's CEO to ban Ben Shapiro, a conservative commentator perhaps best known for giving lectures on college campuses.
[02:24:10.307 --> 02:24:25.236]  Kara Swisher, who, as you may have guessed, is a lesbian, hence her being at the Lesbian Sue Tech Conference, adopted a poor child, along with her wife, who is now 13 years old, and is watching Ben Shapiro videos on YouTube.
[02:24:25.616 --> 02:24:26.557]  I'll get to recommendations.
[02:24:26.577 --> 02:24:28.678]  I have a personal beef with you about that.
[02:24:28.978 --> 02:24:29.298]  Okay.
[02:24:30.118 --> 02:24:31.179]  I can't wait to hear.
[02:24:32.059 --> 02:24:36.882]  My son, who's 13 years old, started watching Ben Shapiro videos.
[02:24:37.042 --> 02:24:40.023]  And he's like the gateway drug to the next group.
[02:24:40.064 --> 02:24:41.484]  And then it goes right to Jordan Peterson.
[02:24:41.524 --> 02:24:42.305]  And then it goes down.
[02:24:42.345 --> 02:24:44.446]  And in three clicks, he was at neo-Nazi stuff.
[02:24:44.846 --> 02:24:45.786]  It was like astonishing.
[02:24:45.806 --> 02:24:47.407]  And then I had to listen to it at dinner.
[02:24:48.068 --> 02:24:50.449]  And I was sort of like, I'm going to kill Susan Wojcicki first.
[02:24:50.509 --> 02:24:51.049]  Okay.
[02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.610]  Carry on.
[02:24:53.110 --> 02:25:10.090]  But it was sort of like, I was sort of like, is there anything like, it feels like, as I said, I think you've heard me say this, it feels like all you tech companies have built cities, these beautiful cities, but you decided not to initially put in police, fire, garbage, street signs.
[02:25:10.931 --> 02:25:12.532]  Um, and stuff like that.
[02:25:12.893 --> 02:25:18.679]  And her brain damage behind the Nazi stuff are probably clips of Tucker Carlson or PewDiePie.
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:21.923]  And then I've got, like, this kid who's like, well, Ben Shapiro's sort of smart.
[02:25:21.943 --> 02:25:22.604]  I'm like, no he's not!
[02:25:22.724 --> 02:25:23.124]  No he's not!
[02:25:23.165 --> 02:25:23.885]  Not even slightly!
[02:25:25.427 --> 02:25:26.768]  He's clever, but he's an idiot.
[02:25:26.788 --> 02:25:28.789]  Anyway, it's just like, it's exhausting.
[02:25:28.989 --> 02:25:30.771]  But it has like a huge effect on them.
[02:25:31.131 --> 02:25:41.938]  Do you feel like the people, on a bigger thing, and it's not your total responsibility, Susan, but it's, do you feel like the people still have a sense of this, of the impact they have?
[02:25:42.198 --> 02:25:43.599]  So, getting to your son.
[02:25:43.619 --> 02:25:44.960]  He's lost.
[02:25:45.540 --> 02:25:48.382]  No, we can work on your son here.
[02:25:48.482 --> 02:25:52.225]  I have a son too, and I get some of these discussions also at the dinner table.
[02:25:52.785 --> 02:26:07.634]  I mean, so... She just said that her 13-year-old son was lost because he's not a social justice warrior, and he's looking up conservative videos on YouTube, and maybe looking to Jordan Peterson as a father figure because he's being raised by two lesbians.
[02:26:07.934 --> 02:26:11.736]  Maybe the poor kid should be put into a foster home consisting of a normal family.
[02:26:11.956 --> 02:26:13.597]  You know, a husband and a wife.
[02:26:13.757 --> 02:26:20.439]  I think what you're describing is, and the way we think about it too, look, there's a set of content that has to meet the community guidelines.
[02:26:20.499 --> 02:26:22.480]  Ben Shapiro's going to meet the community guidelines.
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:25.281]  So I don't think you're suggesting that we remove him from the platform.
[02:26:25.421 --> 02:26:25.701]  Are you?
[02:26:26.201 --> 02:26:27.281]  I would, but I can't.
[02:26:27.481 --> 02:26:27.841]  No, no.
[02:26:27.921 --> 02:26:28.161]  Okay.
[02:26:28.201 --> 02:26:28.922]  But you know what?
[02:26:28.982 --> 02:26:32.543]  But no, you know, last time I saw you, I was like, get Alex Jones off that platform.
[02:26:32.563 --> 02:26:34.543]  And you're like, well, the community guidelines.
[02:26:34.583 --> 02:26:35.384]  And then you got him off.
[02:26:35.404 --> 02:26:36.404]  Now he's not on the platform.
[02:26:36.424 --> 02:26:36.724]  I know.
[02:26:36.864 --> 02:26:37.484]  So I was right.
[02:26:37.544 --> 02:26:38.425]  But that's enough.
[02:26:40.265 --> 02:26:46.687]  She literally said if it was up to her she would ban Ben Shapiro for the same reasons that she wanted Alex Jones.
[02:26:46.787 --> 02:27:08.694]  Alright the full report is at MarkDice.com and Infowars.com and this is what we're dealing with and remember YouTube took me down it's not about me it's about you what they think you're allowed to see because despite the shadow ban we were getting on the main channel 10 million views a week
[02:27:11.479 --> 02:27:14.860]  Before they had a shadow ban, it was like, you know, a hundred million a week.
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:20.682]  And then, of course, I go on Joe Rogan's podcast, and it's the second largest he's ever done.
[02:27:20.942 --> 02:27:22.442]  The third largest is the one before that.
[02:27:25.663 --> 02:27:28.684]  And in a few weeks or so, it'll be the biggest.
[02:27:29.624 --> 02:27:31.184]  It's because Elon Musk is the biggest.
[02:27:31.565 --> 02:27:33.085]  It's about to overtake Elon Musk.
[02:27:34.005 --> 02:27:35.986]  An interview from a year ago, and I'm not bragging.
[02:27:36.026 --> 02:27:40.107]  I'm saying, folks, common sense is popular.
[02:27:42.137 --> 02:27:45.519]  And these people are a bunch of cackling witches.
[02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:49.081]  And it's not because she likes girls that I don't like her.
[02:27:49.282 --> 02:27:52.323]  It's because you don't like free speech in America, you damn witch.
[02:27:53.384 --> 02:27:54.685]  You thin-skinned monster.
[02:27:55.265 --> 02:27:59.168]  You sit on top of the third biggest corporation in the world, pissing down on us.
[02:28:00.348 --> 02:28:03.110]  And then you took me down saying I beat up a kid.
[02:28:03.490 --> 02:28:05.972]  There's no video of that, you lying serpent.
[02:28:09.707 --> 02:28:11.169]  I mean, it's always based on lies.
[02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:12.191]  It's who these people are.
[02:28:12.231 --> 02:28:14.655]  It's like, how far does it go with you people?
[02:28:14.996 --> 02:28:16.639]  You can't compete with us!
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:18.902]  We don't want your crap!
[02:28:20.020 --> 02:28:40.733]  A bunch of giggling, snickering arena full of a bunch of power-tripping women trying to undermine the very free society in Western culture that puts women on a pedestal and then you worship Islam and crap all over your forefathers and some weird, twisted, man-hating crap when you do work for an evil man, Eric Schmidt.
[02:28:42.734 --> 02:28:43.815]  So, whatever.
[02:28:43.835 --> 02:28:46.817]  It's all a big, sick, filthy game.
[02:28:48.397 --> 02:28:48.798]  By the way,
[02:28:49.758 --> 02:28:52.404]  Your son belongs to himself, not you, witch.
[02:28:53.386 --> 02:28:55.792]  Your son belongs to freedom, and he will rebel.
[02:28:55.912 --> 02:28:59.400]  All your sons will turn against you, and so will your daughters, because you are evil.
[02:29:03.206 --> 02:29:06.207]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[02:29:06.568 --> 02:29:12.491]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[02:29:12.912 --> 02:29:18.755]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[02:29:19.095 --> 02:29:21.717]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[02:29:22.017 --> 02:29:29.526]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[02:29:29.546 --> 02:29:37.735]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[02:29:38.336 --> 02:29:42.601]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[02:29:43.456 --> 02:29:47.057]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[02:29:47.277 --> 02:29:53.219]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[02:29:54.199 --> 02:30:03.061]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[02:30:03.601 --> 02:30:07.782]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[02:30:07.822 --> 02:30:09.583]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[02:30:10.663 --> 02:30:12.469]  So the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[02:30:12.489 --> 02:30:13.774]  It was the last run.
[02:30:13.794 --> 02:30:14.757]  It's been sold out for two months.
[02:30:15.851 --> 02:30:16.691]  How is X2 back?
[02:30:17.192 --> 02:30:20.814]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[02:30:21.274 --> 02:30:24.336]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get it anymore.
[02:30:24.936 --> 02:30:34.982]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[02:30:35.042 --> 02:30:38.984]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[02:30:39.404 --> 02:30:40.525]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[02:30:40.945 --> 02:30:45.310]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:47.572]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[02:30:47.973 --> 02:30:49.274]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[02:30:49.794 --> 02:30:52.077]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[02:30:52.637 --> 02:30:54.880]  Well, like a 4.9 star on Power Reviews.
[02:30:55.480 --> 02:30:59.004]  But many of you hear me talk about this, and it's just more background chatter.
[02:30:59.825 --> 02:31:02.288]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:05.622]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[02:31:06.102 --> 02:31:18.670]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[02:31:18.951 --> 02:31:21.372]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[02:31:22.033 --> 02:31:23.173]  So iodine is amazing.
[02:31:23.213 --> 02:31:23.794]  It's important.
[02:31:23.814 --> 02:31:26.055]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[02:31:26.115 --> 02:31:26.636]  They'll hurt you.
[02:31:27.016 --> 02:31:27.716]  This is pure.
[02:31:27.977 --> 02:31:28.697]  This is clean.
[02:31:29.037 --> 02:31:29.818]  This is amazing.
[02:31:30.138 --> 02:31:31.919]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[02:31:33.460 --> 02:31:37.102]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[02:31:37.422 --> 02:31:42.165]  X2 Original from the very first original manufacturer.
[02:31:42.565 --> 02:31:49.089]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:31:49.149 --> 02:31:52.091]  As I said, get your pre-orders in, week, week and a half.
[02:31:52.251 --> 02:32:01.116]  It's being labeled right now, it's already been bottled, and we are going to have it for you, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:01.196 --> 02:32:02.177]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:32:02.932 --> 02:32:04.893]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:32:04.994 --> 02:32:05.334]  Go ahead.
[02:32:05.614 --> 02:32:07.796]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:32:07.816 --> 02:32:10.858]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:32:11.698 --> 02:32:12.819]  It just gets old, man.
[02:32:13.119 --> 02:32:14.841]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:32:15.541 --> 02:32:17.623]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:32:17.863 --> 02:32:21.846]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:32:21.866 --> 02:32:24.368]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:32:25.188 --> 02:32:27.510]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:32:27.870 --> 02:32:29.011]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:32:29.151 --> 02:32:30.032]  Us being shut down?
[02:32:30.272 --> 02:32:31.313]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:32:31.733 --> 02:32:32.774]  You know what, Alex?
[02:32:32.794 --> 02:32:33.895]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[02:32:33.915 --> 02:32:34.736]  Hey, Frank!
[02:32:34.996 --> 02:32:40.380]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:32:40.680 --> 02:32:44.964]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:32:45.204 --> 02:32:48.067]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:32:48.327 --> 02:32:48.707]  You understand?
[02:32:48.807 --> 02:32:50.068]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:32:50.449 --> 02:32:51.610]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:32:52.570 --> 02:32:57.514]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[02:32:58.435 --> 02:32:59.136]  Do you understand?
[02:32:59.156 --> 02:33:00.337]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:33:06.215 --> 02:33:08.936]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:15.018 --> 02:33:20.500]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:40.303 --> 02:33:46.165]  All right, I got a bunch of new breaking news I want to hit during this 50-hour broadcast.
[02:33:46.846 --> 02:33:48.626]  And I appreciate you all tuning in and spreading the word.
[02:33:49.387 --> 02:33:53.869]  But instead of me just giving commentary on all these clips, how about we just play some of these back-to-back?
[02:33:53.909 --> 02:33:54.129]  Because...
[02:33:55.993 --> 02:34:05.419]  Whether it's the Sun online reporter for the Sun News, or whether it's NBC, they all go, oh, it's Facebook, oh, or iPhones, oh, is Google listening to you?
[02:34:05.439 --> 02:34:10.082]  And people then talk in front of their computer or their phone, and then minutes later those ads pop up.
[02:34:10.582 --> 02:34:12.203]  It's in the patents.
[02:34:12.303 --> 02:34:13.864]  They admit they're doing it.
[02:34:14.165 --> 02:34:15.325]  We first wrote about it in 2004.
[02:34:17.427 --> 02:34:22.570]  It's in the terms of service now with smart TVs, which is all the TVs you can buy.
[02:34:25.356 --> 02:34:31.239]  So that's why, I mean, I know it sounds crazy that this is going on, but it is.
[02:34:31.359 --> 02:34:33.260]  So I'm not the crazy one for pointing it out.
[02:34:34.801 --> 02:34:35.722]  I want to play that clip.
[02:34:35.902 --> 02:34:38.123]  Then Tucker reacts to female deadlifting record.
[02:34:38.163 --> 02:34:39.304]  The guy's obviously a dude.
[02:34:40.905 --> 02:34:42.906]  Prime Minister Netanyahu deeply grateful to US support.
[02:34:42.926 --> 02:34:45.587]  And then Trump visits a tank factory.
[02:34:45.607 --> 02:34:50.370]  And there's a report I want to describe here, but he's a Jewish Australian.
[02:34:51.465 --> 02:34:54.268]  Who wanted to be interviewed by this big international TV host.
[02:34:55.489 --> 02:34:56.651]  They wanted to interview him.
[02:34:58.132 --> 02:35:02.196]  And then... He said, okay, but I'm not going to be on there with any neo-Nazis.
[02:35:02.216 --> 02:35:04.058]  Because you know what they were going to try to do?
[02:35:04.078 --> 02:35:05.520]  Because the guy's anti-radical Islam.
[02:35:05.780 --> 02:35:07.782]  He wanted to compare the two and say, oh look, Jews are with Nazis.
[02:35:09.304 --> 02:35:11.486]  And the video's gone viral since it went up two days ago.
[02:35:12.922 --> 02:35:14.522]  And he did what I wish I'd have done.
[02:35:14.542 --> 02:35:22.865]  Instead of just audio, he had video of the guy interviewing him and said completely different things that edited his answers together to make it sound like he was saying all this horrible stuff.
[02:35:23.365 --> 02:35:26.886]  I mean, you have to experience mainstream media.
[02:35:26.906 --> 02:35:28.746]  They're there to murder the truth.
[02:35:29.306 --> 02:35:31.947]  So that video is up on Infowars.com in full, but we're going to get to that.
[02:35:31.967 --> 02:35:35.088]  And then there's going to be ongoing broadcasts throughout the night.
[02:35:35.108 --> 02:35:37.548]  We'll be having a bunch of calls, a bunch of other big guests.
[02:35:38.088 --> 02:35:39.129]  Tommy Robinson's coming on.
[02:35:39.169 --> 02:35:39.649]  Joe Rogan.
[02:35:41.226 --> 02:35:45.809]  You gotta love how planes only get delayed when it's for a live show, but he'll be in later today.
[02:35:45.829 --> 02:35:49.651]  We're going to tape something, and I'm going to air part of it tonight, and I'm going to air the full interview.
[02:35:50.812 --> 02:35:54.594]  We're going to do a pretty good-sized interview on Monday.
[02:35:55.014 --> 02:35:58.316]  Maybe I'll even air it Sunday, but I don't normally hype interviews up.
[02:35:58.336 --> 02:36:00.237]  It'll be a pretty big interview, talking about some big subjects.
[02:36:01.178 --> 02:36:02.699]  So let's go ahead and just back-to-back.
[02:36:03.539 --> 02:36:03.900]  You know what?
[02:36:04.100 --> 02:36:10.229]  Let's go to Avi Yemini exposes Jim Jeffries with hidden camera.
[02:36:10.249 --> 02:36:10.950]  I'm getting radio blisters.
[02:36:10.970 --> 02:36:17.299]  You can go to Infowars.com and see it, but you'll hear the audio, but he just totally edits different conversations together to deceive.
[02:36:17.499 --> 02:36:18.040]  Here's that report.
[02:36:19.804 --> 02:36:25.269]  Months ago, Jim Jefferies, producer, contacted me and asked me to come on as a guest to his show.
[02:36:25.970 --> 02:36:27.972]  Now I agreed with two conditions.
[02:36:28.553 --> 02:36:37.742]  One, there'll be no neo-Nazi or Nazi sympathisers on the same segment because I don't want to be aligned to them and I don't want to give them any legitimacy or anything like that.
[02:36:38.042 --> 02:36:38.523]  Common sense.
[02:36:39.123 --> 02:36:43.548]  The second one was that they don't cut my answers from one question and put it to another.
[02:36:44.864 --> 02:36:49.709]  Now, to my horror, but not my surprise, they did exactly both.
[02:36:50.509 --> 02:36:51.290]  Both those things.
[02:36:51.891 --> 02:36:52.992]  But they went even further.
[02:36:54.033 --> 02:36:58.577]  They connected me to the Christchurch killer to the terrorist.
[02:36:58.965 --> 02:37:04.469]  The New Zealand shooter left behind a detailed record of his anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric.
[02:37:04.929 --> 02:37:10.813]  And unfortunately, these days, this kind of intolerance is being tolerated in more places than you might think.
[02:37:11.333 --> 02:37:15.376]  So it's important to remember that this was filmed a few months ago.
[02:37:16.557 --> 02:37:21.040]  And not in response to the Christchurch massacre, as they seem to be alluding here.
[02:37:22.012 --> 02:37:30.818]  I was shocked to hear that the prick allegedly behind the Christchurch New Zealand mass shootings is a white supremacist who grew up and was radicalised in Australia.
[02:37:32.139 --> 02:37:34.420]  So what is the situation down there?
[02:37:34.660 --> 02:37:37.202]  And what are the people who may have radicalised him saying?
[02:37:37.762 --> 02:37:42.826]  White people like myself feel happy and safe around my culture, my people.
[02:37:45.089 --> 02:37:45.809]  Sherman's a Nazi.
[02:37:46.430 --> 02:37:48.831]  You broke Rule 1 in 20 seconds.
[02:37:49.771 --> 02:37:53.793]  And this anti-immigration fervour is uniting some strange groups.
[02:37:54.254 --> 02:38:00.016]  It turns out that the one thing that can bring together the alt-right and the Jew is their shared hatred of Muslims.
[02:38:00.477 --> 02:38:04.479]  Meet Jewish activist Avi Yememi, a good Australian name.
[02:38:04.619 --> 02:38:08.601]  Luckily I'm not an idiot, and I knew what their plan was all along.
[02:38:09.653 --> 02:38:14.695]  Well, they flew me to Singapore, put me in a hotel for a couple of days there.
[02:38:16.176 --> 02:38:17.136]  What was I to expect?
[02:38:17.356 --> 02:38:17.957]  It was a set up.
[02:38:19.117 --> 02:38:26.861]  So what I did was, I got there and I secretly put my phones down to record the entire segment.
[02:38:27.721 --> 02:38:34.424]  Now over the next few days I'm going to release a bunch of little clips that are important that he specifically didn't add to the piece.
[02:38:34.464 --> 02:38:35.825]  We filmed for about an hour.
[02:38:37.150 --> 02:38:42.251]  And there's about three or four minutes where he's included little snippets.
[02:38:43.191 --> 02:38:47.352]  So in the next few days I'm going to release little bits that are important, that I think everyone needs to see.
[02:38:47.692 --> 02:38:50.913]  But if you're on my Patreon, you can see the entire hour.
[02:38:50.973 --> 02:38:52.253]  I'll upload it within the next week.
[02:38:53.094 --> 02:38:54.274]  Islamic immigration, cut it!
[02:38:54.694 --> 02:38:58.815]  Now what makes Arvi suddenly feel so comfortable saying this s*** out loud?
[02:38:59.235 --> 02:39:02.896]  I always stand by my words and I say it publicly, loudly and proudly.
[02:39:04.130 --> 02:39:08.151]  I won't say in private something different than what I'll say in public.
[02:39:09.591 --> 02:39:15.552]  And if I get it wrong, which I have at times, and I feel necessary to apologise, I've done it.
[02:39:16.053 --> 02:39:16.733]  And I will do it.
[02:39:17.213 --> 02:39:19.233]  I might sound like a hippie saying this.
[02:39:19.373 --> 02:39:24.174]  What gives anyone the right to tell anyone where they can and can't live?
[02:39:24.274 --> 02:39:26.855]  When you import this culture, what do you think's gonna happen?
[02:39:26.895 --> 02:39:30.315]  Australia's gonna end up the same s***hole that they came from that they were escaping.
[02:39:31.176 --> 02:39:31.856]  Watch how
[02:39:32.987 --> 02:39:37.369]  Jim Jefferies has edited this last clip to make me look like an arse.
[02:39:38.810 --> 02:39:40.210]  See what I really said.
[02:39:40.510 --> 02:39:46.313]  What gives anyone the right to tell anyone where they can and can't live?
[02:39:46.393 --> 02:39:46.733]  Really?
[02:39:46.773 --> 02:39:47.994]  They've got no borders though.
[02:39:48.034 --> 02:39:50.735]  I know, they've got no borders but wouldn't it just be nice if...
[02:39:52.330 --> 02:40:03.799]  If we got to a place in society where we had no utopia, where we all just lived as... You may say I'm a dreamer.
[02:40:04.020 --> 02:40:09.464]  I think most people, most sensible people would agree with you in theory.
[02:40:10.685 --> 02:40:13.767]  But in practice, it goes against human nature.
[02:40:13.827 --> 02:40:14.648]  It just doesn't work.
[02:40:16.269 --> 02:40:17.871]  You bloody scumbag, Jim.
[02:40:19.301 --> 02:40:21.862]  You see those rubbish edits through the entire segment?
[02:40:21.962 --> 02:40:23.043]  I don't even need to show you.
[02:40:23.283 --> 02:40:24.024]  You get my point.
[02:40:24.924 --> 02:40:27.365]  They pull one answer to a different question.
[02:40:28.146 --> 02:40:46.236]  But, today what I really want to show you is how Jim Jefferies speaks about Islam, about their prophet Muhammad, and about Muslims themselves, when he thinks the cameras aren't rolling, or when he knows he can cut it out.
[02:40:47.184 --> 02:40:48.927]  So Mohammed is considered the perfect man?
[02:40:49.087 --> 02:40:49.428]  Right, yes.
[02:40:49.508 --> 02:40:49.769]  Okay.
[02:40:50.049 --> 02:40:51.031]  You can't draw a picture of him.
[02:40:51.071 --> 02:40:51.973]  No, don't you dare.
[02:40:51.993 --> 02:40:52.714]  Don't you dare.
[02:40:52.814 --> 02:40:54.197]  I've got enough death threats on me, brother.
[02:40:54.217 --> 02:40:54.818]  There he is.
[02:40:54.878 --> 02:40:56.041]  Jesus Christ.
[02:40:56.061 --> 02:40:56.602]  There he is.
[02:40:56.622 --> 02:40:57.924]  He looks like a wobbly ghost.
[02:40:59.204 --> 02:41:02.507]  He's finally going to understand Islam after this s*** comes out!
[02:41:03.828 --> 02:41:07.491]  That's what you do, Jimmy, when you think no one's going to see it.
[02:41:07.691 --> 02:41:10.993]  Now, I don't actually have a problem if you draw Muhammad, to be honest.
[02:41:11.053 --> 02:41:11.474]  That's me.
[02:41:11.554 --> 02:41:22.783]  But people like you call me an Islamophobe because that riles up, that upsets, that, in your words, triggers the Muslim into violence.
[02:41:24.571 --> 02:41:33.194]  Now I wonder, when this goes far and wide, and help it, share it around, let the world see, I want to see if the leftists condemn Jim.
[02:41:33.995 --> 02:41:51.002]  And even more so, what I'm interested to see, is the people that he is hell-bent on protecting, the people that he is fighting so hard to let into Australia, and the US, let's see how they react when they see him mock their prophet.
[02:41:52.262 --> 02:41:53.403]  You know what the punishment for
[02:41:54.693 --> 02:41:55.935]  Blasphemy is, Jim.
[02:41:55.955 --> 02:41:57.798]  I wish you luck, brother.
[02:41:58.999 --> 02:41:59.820]  But it gets worse.
[02:42:01.162 --> 02:42:04.948]  Watch what he says when the cameras aren't rolling.
[02:42:05.422 --> 02:42:06.623]  I'm not a big fan of Islam.
[02:42:06.883 --> 02:42:11.327]  I think that wearing a burqa is stupid and demeaning and all these things.
[02:42:11.347 --> 02:42:11.588]  Islam.
[02:42:11.688 --> 02:42:12.528]  Islam or dingo?
[02:42:12.829 --> 02:42:14.550]  Islam and dingo are sneaky.
[02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:15.811]  Probably both.
[02:42:15.931 --> 02:42:16.452]  Probably both.
[02:42:17.212 --> 02:42:17.613]  Dangerous?
[02:42:18.393 --> 02:42:19.955]  Probably both.
[02:42:20.035 --> 02:42:21.716]  I think I ate a baby.
[02:42:21.796 --> 02:42:22.697]  Let's stop right there.
[02:42:23.598 --> 02:42:25.700]  The full report's up on Infowars.com.
[02:42:26.741 --> 02:42:28.442]  And you see him over and over again.
[02:42:28.522 --> 02:42:29.003]  Shut him up!
[02:42:30.100 --> 02:42:35.325]  And then he says something very reasonable, and then he tricks them in conversations to say something else to sandwich together.
[02:42:36.226 --> 02:42:38.989]  And they'll cut from in front and from back so you don't know.
[02:42:39.089 --> 02:42:40.350]  It's called fraud.
[02:42:41.371 --> 02:42:42.612]  It's called fraud.
[02:42:43.073 --> 02:42:46.376]  And I'm telling you, you talk to any mainstream media, they all do it now.
[02:42:47.597 --> 02:42:48.518]  There is no bottom.
[02:42:49.159 --> 02:42:50.780]  I told Megyn Kelly Sandy Hook happened.
[02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:52.402]  She edited it where I said it didn't happen.
[02:42:53.499 --> 02:42:57.801]  She is a criminal, a fraud, a demonic vampire, a pig creature.
[02:42:58.262 --> 02:42:59.382]  God, she makes me sick.
[02:42:59.763 --> 02:43:02.444]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:02.464 --> 02:43:08.167]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[02:44:50.188 --> 02:44:51.629]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:44:51.689 --> 02:44:52.689]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:44:53.169 --> 02:44:59.331]  So take a half-packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[02:47:06.212 --> 02:47:08.816]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.770 --> 02:47:32.135]  Again, a few weeks ago we decided to have a Save the First Amendment, Stop Big Tech Censorship 50-hour broadcast.
[02:47:32.976 --> 02:47:46.285]  And Trump, with another beautiful sneak attack against the globalists, this morning signed an executive order where they pull federal funding from any university that bans free speech and engages in basically malice-style brainwashing.
[02:47:46.305 --> 02:47:47.586]  That's actually the model they use.
[02:47:47.626 --> 02:47:48.707]  You can't make that up.
[02:47:49.928 --> 02:47:51.509]  Even Obama, a member of the Defense Department,
[02:47:53.163 --> 02:47:55.784]  Changed it where they said that we'll have re-education camps.
[02:47:56.664 --> 02:47:57.945]  And that's the Soviet term.
[02:47:58.785 --> 02:47:59.766]  Re-education camps.
[02:48:00.266 --> 02:48:03.287]  And it's not that our military's bad, it's that Obama in control of it was bad.
[02:48:04.087 --> 02:48:07.469]  So they're following classic models because they've worked before.
[02:48:07.989 --> 02:48:09.009]  You can't make this up.
[02:48:12.791 --> 02:48:14.992]  And there's so many big articles on this front breaking.
[02:48:15.032 --> 02:48:20.914]  So if we don't have speech, we don't have anything.
[02:48:21.886 --> 02:48:24.668]  So these are real authoritarians, real tyrants.
[02:48:25.969 --> 02:48:30.713]  Now I want to hit some other news I haven't gotten to, a lot breaking on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:48:30.733 --> 02:48:42.242]  But first, when I explain and show you the statistics where we're number one here, we're number one there, and then we get banned, banned, banned, banned, banned, it's because they understand freedom is popular.
[02:48:42.823 --> 02:48:45.505]  It's not that hard to understand.
[02:48:47.378 --> 02:48:49.819]  And the people trying to keep me from that are horrible.
[02:48:50.460 --> 02:48:51.240]  And they're dangerous.
[02:48:52.041 --> 02:48:57.344]  And if they'll work with Communist China, that's killed more people than Hitler ever thought about, they'll do some bad stuff to you.
[02:48:57.404 --> 02:49:00.386]  It shows they have no bottom.
[02:49:03.207 --> 02:49:04.068]  Joe Rogan just texted me.
[02:49:04.088 --> 02:49:04.748]  He's on the ground.
[02:49:04.788 --> 02:49:05.809]  He's coming over here right now.
[02:49:07.250 --> 02:49:08.651]  Tom Papert says it's the fourth hour.
[02:49:08.671 --> 02:49:10.472]  I was going to have Joe on this hour.
[02:49:12.034 --> 02:49:12.894]  It'll be better taping it.
[02:49:14.035 --> 02:49:15.335]  Then I can air it Sunday or Monday.
[02:49:15.755 --> 02:49:16.515]  Maybe I'll air it tonight.
[02:49:16.575 --> 02:49:16.915]  Who knows?
[02:49:17.835 --> 02:49:20.316]  But that should be good because he's got some big topics that we're going to discuss.
[02:49:20.976 --> 02:49:21.977]  We'll see how that goes.
[02:49:22.117 --> 02:49:27.338]  But the 50-hour broadcast will roll on with a bunch of big guests I haven't even mentioned.
[02:49:27.358 --> 02:49:28.858]  I should probably put on screen some of them.
[02:49:28.898 --> 02:49:30.299]  Tommy Robinson coming up tonight.
[02:49:31.159 --> 02:49:33.259]  So many others throughout the evening.
[02:49:33.399 --> 02:49:36.200]  Of course, Owen Schroer and others that are going to be hosting.
[02:49:37.921 --> 02:49:39.141]  The crew is pointing out to me
[02:49:40.310 --> 02:49:42.611]  That, hey, this is kind of a fundraiser.
[02:49:43.051 --> 02:49:44.991]  Soros is funding all these deals to shut you down.
[02:49:46.772 --> 02:49:48.252]  You might want to actually plug something.
[02:49:48.992 --> 02:49:49.853]  And that's a good point.
[02:49:50.273 --> 02:49:56.695]  We have storewide free shipping, 50% off all the supplements, a bunch of other big sales, double Patriot points.
[02:49:56.735 --> 02:49:58.455]  That's 10% off your next order.
[02:49:59.876 --> 02:50:01.756]  Additional 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:50:03.517 --> 02:50:04.937]  This is undoubtedly the biggest sale ever.
[02:50:05.277 --> 02:50:08.118]  We just keep accelerating because people love them.
[02:50:10.896 --> 02:50:15.300]  Every hour, there's a different item that's even more, 60% off.
[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:21.965]  This hour, colloidal silver, highest quality colloidal silver, private label, same stuff they sell in Whole Foods.
[02:50:22.906 --> 02:50:23.827]  Click that for folks, please.
[02:50:24.708 --> 02:50:25.708]  And it's a good deal for $25.
[02:50:25.808 --> 02:50:27.210]  And that's its regular price.
[02:50:27.230 --> 02:50:28.351]  That's what they sell it for at Whole Foods.
[02:50:29.091 --> 02:50:31.854]  But we're selling it for a lot lower than that, $11.98.
[02:50:32.574 --> 02:50:37.798]  You're never going to get a big bottle of high quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver anywhere near this.
[02:50:39.741 --> 02:50:44.767]  They've got smaller parts per million, but those have been found in the balance to be toxic.
[02:50:45.829 --> 02:50:51.416]  Obviously, if something's going to kill bacteria and viruses, it's pretty tough.
[02:50:52.637 --> 02:50:57.403]  So everything's a cost-benefit analysis, and 30 parts is what's recognized to be the safest.
[02:50:58.712 --> 02:51:01.314]  You know, some people have their, you know, got to go thermal nuclear.
[02:51:01.354 --> 02:51:02.435]  They do even stronger silver.
[02:51:02.916 --> 02:51:05.298]  And we sell topical silver that's way stronger.
[02:51:05.578 --> 02:51:09.301]  The only FDA approved over the counter where the only group has been able to private label it.
[02:51:09.842 --> 02:51:10.762]  And it's our wound gel.
[02:51:12.424 --> 02:51:12.904]  Unbelievable.
[02:51:13.705 --> 02:51:16.067]  But you would never want to ingest it.
[02:51:18.449 --> 02:51:19.390]  Topical only.
[02:51:20.571 --> 02:51:25.195]  It's the strongest stuff on the market in the United States.
[02:51:27.159 --> 02:51:27.279]  It's $22.
[02:51:27.519 --> 02:51:32.863]  In fact, I guess they did all the supplements and all the health stuff at 50% off.
[02:51:33.384 --> 02:51:34.605]  We can't even do it for that!
[02:51:34.645 --> 02:51:35.786]  That's what we pay for it!
[02:51:36.806 --> 02:51:38.448]  See, there's a few snafus here.
[02:51:39.448 --> 02:51:45.053]  Oh yeah, just the approval for them to get this through cost them unbelievable amounts of money, so that's why they sell it in stores for $40.
[02:51:45.153 --> 02:51:50.797]  We usually sell it for like $30, but I guess they did do it for $17.95.
[02:51:51.658 --> 02:51:52.198]  Wow!
[02:51:53.499 --> 02:51:55.681]  Well, if you wanted super silver wound gel,
[02:51:57.779 --> 02:51:59.740]  I just give orders, I go, everything 50% off!
[02:51:59.780 --> 02:52:03.401]  And I'm thinking, some stuff is only marked up 100%.
[02:52:04.841 --> 02:52:06.762]  So that's something you definitely want.
[02:52:06.862 --> 02:52:10.143]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:52:10.223 --> 02:52:21.546]  You know, being the most outlawed country for real, being the big fat black sheep, the establishment has its benefits.
[02:52:23.049 --> 02:52:29.591]  Because we reached out to the top companies, and it's in hospitals, it's sold at all the big drug stores, for $40.
[02:52:29.691 --> 02:52:33.112]  On sale, maybe $35, because it's very expensive to make.
[02:52:33.732 --> 02:52:35.152]  And again, the FDA approval process.
[02:52:36.153 --> 02:52:42.475]  And they're like huge fans, and they're like, we'll never let anybody private label that we're going to let you.
[02:52:42.495 --> 02:52:43.855]  So, there's some fringe benefits out there.
[02:52:45.402 --> 02:52:46.703]  Uh, to being persecuted.
[02:52:46.763 --> 02:52:50.364]  You see 100% reviews on Super Silver.
[02:52:50.384 --> 02:52:51.425]  100% reviews.
[02:52:51.485 --> 02:52:52.585]  It's just uncanny.
[02:52:53.046 --> 02:52:54.326]  Tiny little speck on your hands.
[02:52:55.587 --> 02:52:56.547]  They're cut up or whatever.
[02:52:56.627 --> 02:53:12.495]  And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[02:53:13.447 --> 02:53:16.249]  But it's like anything that's gonna kill stuff.
[02:53:16.849 --> 02:53:19.731]  By the way, this is one of the things we can say kills a bunch of stuff that nothing else does.
[02:53:20.492 --> 02:53:21.932]  You gotta go read about the wound gel.
[02:53:22.353 --> 02:53:33.780]  Some of these products are so powerful, I never even really talk about how good they are because there's all these FDA stuff where you're not supposed to ever talk about something except DNA Force has the studies and we've got the patented stuff.
[02:53:33.820 --> 02:53:40.124]  I'm actually allowed to say regrows nerves, does all this, makes telomeres not shrink as fast, which is the same thing as making them grow.
[02:53:44.912 --> 02:53:53.012]  It's just crazy that we're allowed to talk about the silver wound gel because it's approved.
[02:53:54.335 --> 02:54:08.758]  And so, remind me guys to cut an end for the wound gel and DNA Force, because it's not that I'm intimidated by the system, I just know our listeners are smart and they can figure out what turmeric does, they can figure out what these things do, what pure iodine does, and I just say, hey, look into it, this is really the best stuff out there.
[02:54:08.998 --> 02:54:11.338]  People find out how great it is and that it's the best out there.
[02:54:11.798 --> 02:54:22.600]  But a lot of our products now are actually things that have got all the studies and have done the approvals and all that, because a lot of them are just private-labeled, the top-end stuff, by the way.
[02:54:23.809 --> 02:54:25.993]  I'm working with four medical doctors.
[02:54:26.414 --> 02:54:31.965]  One of them owns one of the largest regenerative and health clinics in Texas.
[02:54:33.677 --> 02:54:34.957]  And these are M.D.
[02:54:34.997 --> 02:54:35.358]  doctors.
[02:54:36.378 --> 02:54:37.658]  Some of them are like two or three M.D.s.
[02:54:38.918 --> 02:54:53.642]  And they've got pharmaceutical-grade supplements, and a lot of ours are what you'd call that, just a certain grade, but that we're going to bring to market as well, not through the M4s label, but through these medical doctors labels, because they're that exciting.
[02:54:54.281 --> 02:54:58.362]  So there's just a lot of good doors are opening thanks to your prayers and support.
[02:54:58.982 --> 02:55:00.183]  I'm never arrogant about it.
[02:55:00.203 --> 02:55:01.003]  I never say, oh, I'm so smart.
[02:55:01.023 --> 02:55:03.323]  That's why we're beating the enemy and have gone through all this.
[02:55:03.403 --> 02:55:06.064]  No, it's because of prayer and you supporting us.
[02:55:06.584 --> 02:55:11.666]  And I'm just kind of the crazy clown God's used to put up there at the front line.
[02:55:11.686 --> 02:55:16.987]  And God loves children, drunks in the United State of America.
[02:55:18.672 --> 02:55:20.094]  And I've been a child.
[02:55:20.295 --> 02:55:22.258]  I'm from the United States, and I've been a drunk before.
[02:55:23.039 --> 02:55:25.163]  So I'm just... Von Bismarck said that.
[02:55:25.223 --> 02:55:27.506]  God loves... What's up, Daria?
[02:55:32.526 --> 02:55:33.026]  Oh, thank you.
[02:55:33.446 --> 02:55:35.287]  Oh, they're reminding me I should have actually done the plug.
[02:55:36.347 --> 02:55:37.487]  Oh, so that hour just ended.
[02:55:37.507 --> 02:55:42.329]  We've now got bodies, 60% off, ultimate turmeric formula, 95% curcuminoid.
[02:55:42.729 --> 02:55:52.612]  Folks, if you don't know about turmeric, you don't know about curcuminoid levels, we're probably, we can't say for sure, we believe we're the only company that has a 95% curcuminoid.
[02:55:52.632 --> 02:55:58.753]  I went to the top developers and I said, what's your, who makes it for more than a dozen companies, I said, what's your top product?
[02:55:59.193 --> 02:56:00.034]  They go, it's about 90% curcuminoid.
[02:56:02.349 --> 02:56:03.230]  But that's just ridiculous.
[02:56:03.250 --> 02:56:03.971]  There's no need to do that.
[02:56:04.011 --> 02:56:04.832]  It's too expensive.
[02:56:05.152 --> 02:56:08.896]  I said, what's the strongest you can do with the patented concentration process?
[02:56:09.436 --> 02:56:10.498]  They got back with us.
[02:56:10.718 --> 02:56:12.099]  They said 95.
[02:56:12.199 --> 02:56:14.782]  It's like 96 percent, but they round down in supplements.
[02:56:14.842 --> 02:56:15.403]  It's 95 plus.
[02:56:15.463 --> 02:56:17.345]  I said, OK, I'll take that.
[02:56:17.425 --> 02:56:20.348]  And they go, well, that costs like twice as much as Mr. Jones.
[02:56:20.368 --> 02:56:20.909]  You need to do that.
[02:56:20.949 --> 02:56:21.489]  I said, I'm doing it.
[02:56:24.690 --> 02:56:26.151]  I want to be the guy that's on the opposite end.
[02:56:26.231 --> 02:56:27.751]  These guys want to put a bunch of filler.
[02:56:27.791 --> 02:56:30.312]  These other fly-by-night companies, they want to just have a bunch of hype about it.
[02:56:30.472 --> 02:56:34.554]  I want to be the guy that doesn't hype it up and just gives you the best because that's what I want.
[02:56:34.834 --> 02:56:37.235]  I give these products to myself and my children.
[02:56:37.835 --> 02:56:39.056]  Shave the First Amendment.
[02:56:39.136 --> 02:56:40.557]  Stop big tech censorship.
[02:56:40.577 --> 02:56:43.218]  50-hour broadcast special flash sale.
[02:56:45.598 --> 02:56:46.819]  Bodies 60% off.
[02:56:46.879 --> 02:56:57.147]  And we've got 55% off Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, all Super Blue products, Super Silver Wound Gel, Brain Force Plus, DNA Force Plus, Knockout and Silver Bullet.
[02:56:57.167 --> 02:56:58.108]  They're 60% off.
[02:56:58.488 --> 02:56:59.809]  And I guess they didn't explain this.
[02:56:59.849 --> 02:57:05.974]  We're doing a super flash sale for the next two hours where everything that was on sale goes back to the original sales price.
[02:57:06.154 --> 02:57:09.998]  But if you miss that, it's still all free shipping, store-wide, and 50% off.
[02:57:10.498 --> 02:57:12.139]  But if you act now, I guess you get an initial 10% off.
[02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:15.345]  So again, I want to thank you all, and I'm going to stop babbling now.
[02:57:15.385 --> 02:57:18.912]  Whatever you do, support our local AM and FM stations, local TV stations.
[02:57:19.253 --> 02:57:20.776]  Spread the word, support their sponsors.
[02:57:21.974 --> 02:57:22.714]  We're in a war.
[02:57:23.275 --> 02:57:24.556]  And this isn't a spectator sport.
[02:57:24.956 --> 02:57:29.619]  And you're going to learn fighting, as many of you have learned, is enjoyable when you're doing it for the right reasons.
[02:57:29.639 --> 02:57:30.659]  So, this didn't work.
[02:57:30.679 --> 02:57:31.360]  This is fun.
[02:57:31.820 --> 02:57:36.643]  Let's get in there toe-to-toe with the globalists and go all the way and see what it's really like and where it takes us.
[02:57:36.663 --> 02:57:38.444]  I think it's going to take us somewhere good.
[02:57:39.044 --> 02:57:41.465]  America 2.0 to the stars and beyond.
[02:57:42.046 --> 02:57:43.006]  We're going beyond the stars.
[02:57:43.367 --> 02:57:44.627]  Tom Pafford's taking over.
[02:57:44.647 --> 02:57:46.188]  Joe Rogan's going to be in studio soon.
[02:57:46.528 --> 02:57:47.569]  Watch those live streams.
[02:57:47.869 --> 02:57:49.610]  InfoWars.com, Forged Life Show.
[02:57:49.870 --> 02:57:50.431]  Thank you all.
[02:57:52.545 --> 02:57:54.866]  It's time.
[02:57:58.447 --> 02:58:03.769]  This is the Save the First Amendment, Stop Big Tech, Stop the Bias 50-hour broadcast.
[02:58:03.789 --> 02:58:06.589]  We've got everybody from Laura Loomer to Tommy Robinson joining us.
[02:58:06.769 --> 02:58:10.471]  I believe Joe said he could do it, but Joe is famously busy, okay?
[02:58:10.491 --> 02:58:11.631]  But regardless, I'm going to interview with him.
[02:58:11.711 --> 02:58:12.391]  He's coming to town.
[02:58:12.471 --> 02:58:13.992]  And there's a bunch of other surprise guests.
[02:58:14.072 --> 02:58:15.072]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:58:15.192 --> 02:58:21.654]  From now right through Saturday morning, 10 a.m., focal point on free speech and a focal point on what we're fighting and what the stakes are.
[02:58:21.894 --> 02:58:24.235]  Please don't forget, store-wide free shipping right now.
[02:58:24.255 --> 02:58:26.996]  50% off all the supplements and a bunch of other specials.

[02:58:32.359 --> 02:58:33.679]  And there's double Patriot points.
[02:58:33.839 --> 02:58:36.240]  And if you sign up for AutoShip, you can't sell any time for free.
[02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:38.361]  You get an additional 10% off.
[02:58:38.521 --> 02:58:40.582]  It just goes on and on and on and on from there.
[02:58:40.602 --> 02:58:41.703]  InfoMoreStore.com.
[02:58:42.043 --> 02:58:43.144]  Everything's 50% off.
[02:58:43.164 --> 02:58:46.427]  It's a supplement and double pay 3 points and free shipping.
[02:58:46.527 --> 02:58:53.654]  And you fund an operation where we get up here and fight the pedophiles and fight people openly saying we're gonna kill babies after they're born and sell their goodies.
[02:58:54.094 --> 02:58:55.336]  Because they want their goodies.
[02:58:56.336 --> 02:58:57.317]  Hell, I mean the pedophiles...
[02:58:58.338 --> 02:58:59.479]  I guess just rape the kids.
[02:58:59.499 --> 02:59:02.923]  These folks want to kill them better than a hammer and sell their goods.
[02:59:03.203 --> 02:59:03.984]  Shell their innards.
[02:59:04.144 --> 02:59:06.566]  Shell what the womb God created made.
[02:59:06.766 --> 02:59:08.007]  They just think we're going to take it.
[02:59:08.048 --> 02:59:09.309]  Well some of us aren't going to take it.
[02:59:09.409 --> 02:59:16.636]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, humanize these babies and give them at least as much value as the governor when he's not wearing a KKK outfit.
[02:59:16.696 --> 02:59:17.236]  Blackface.
[02:59:17.436 --> 02:59:17.997]  Totally evil.
[02:59:18.077 --> 02:59:20.179]  These innocent little children suffer little children under me.
[02:59:20.319 --> 02:59:22.261]  Better for someone to throw themselves in the deepest ocean with a gun.
[02:59:22.261 --> 02:59:23.542]  A giant stone cut around their neck.
[02:59:23.602 --> 02:59:24.783]  A millstone would hurt one of these.
[02:59:24.883 --> 02:59:25.463]  Think about that.
[02:59:25.543 --> 02:59:27.564]  And quite frankly, I'm proud of what we've done together.
[02:59:27.704 --> 02:59:29.646]  You, the audience, are the InfoWar.
[02:59:30.226 --> 02:59:31.227]  I'm not just saying that.

[02:59:45.976 --> 02:59:46.476]  I almost forgot.
[02:59:46.816 --> 02:59:47.477]  Huge specials.
[02:59:47.517 --> 02:59:48.297]  Take advantage of them.
[02:59:48.317 --> 02:59:49.198]  Support the InfoWar.

[02:59:50.638 --> 02:59:51.159]  We'll be right back.
[02:59:55.276 --> 03:00:01.181]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:15.587 --> 03:00:17.929]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:17.989 --> 03:00:19.631]  This is the fourth hour.
[03:00:19.851 --> 03:00:35.484]  I am Tom Pappert, Facebook's God-Emperor Trump, guest hosting, filling in for Alex Jones during this behemoth, monumental 50-hour live broadcast to stop big tech censorship, tongue twister there, and protect the First Amendment.
[03:00:35.504 --> 03:00:37.066]  I've got a lot I want to talk about today.
[03:00:37.146 --> 03:00:42.571]  Thank you to InfoWars, thank you to Alex Jones, and thank you to the InfoWarriors out there in the audience for tuning in.
[03:00:43.331 --> 03:00:54.931]  During this fourth hour so I am just as disappointed as everybody else that Joe Rogan his flight was apparently delayed and he was not able to get there in time to be on the show during the live broadcast today but
[03:00:55.788 --> 03:01:00.029]  There's some interesting Joe Rogan news that I want to discuss.
[03:01:00.229 --> 03:01:05.831]  Of course, everybody remembers that he had a little bit of an argument with Alex Jones over these past couple months.
[03:01:06.111 --> 03:01:10.533]  He went on, Alex went on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast to bury the hatchet.
[03:01:10.813 --> 03:01:12.734]  Joe Rogan appeared on InfoWars.
[03:01:13.254 --> 03:01:16.975]  And now, because of this friendship, because that
[03:01:18.347 --> 03:01:21.190]  Joe Rogan has not completely thrown Alex under the bus.
[03:01:21.710 --> 03:01:27.635]  We're seeing the left turn on their favorite podcaster, Joe Rogan.
[03:01:27.915 --> 03:01:31.418]  There's a new article up on Slate.com as of yesterday.
[03:01:31.758 --> 03:01:34.461]  Joe Rogan's galaxy brain.
[03:01:35.121 --> 03:01:42.047]  And they make fun of him, they trash him, they tie him to the spooky, scary, intellectual dark web.
[03:01:42.427 --> 03:01:54.395]  And say that essentially the case being made here is that because Joe Rogan will have people like Tim Pool and Alex Jones and Jack Dorsey and because he will facilitate these discussions, he peddles fear.
[03:01:54.955 --> 03:01:58.338]  And he must be removed from the internet now as well.
[03:01:58.438 --> 03:02:01.240]  So this article is absolutely comical.
[03:02:01.300 --> 03:02:03.161]  It's about 4,000 words.
[03:02:03.461 --> 03:02:11.847]  I think somebody, one of these learned to code journalists over at Slate, I think they accidentally doubled up on their ADHD amphetamines one morning when they wrote this.
[03:02:12.647 --> 03:02:13.448]  I'm going to break it down.
[03:02:13.488 --> 03:02:17.211]  I've got a couple little clips here that I want to read.
[03:02:18.092 --> 03:02:19.453]  And here's how it starts.
[03:02:19.974 --> 03:02:27.801]  How the former Fear Factor host podcast became an essential platform for, quote, free thinkers who hate the left.
[03:02:28.564 --> 03:02:30.726]  This is already just absolutely comical to me.
[03:02:30.746 --> 03:02:32.867]  I mean, I am no enemy of Joe Rogan.
[03:02:32.887 --> 03:02:37.410]  I think that he does a wonderful job hosting the podcast, and I love that he's had Alex Jones on twice.
[03:02:37.791 --> 03:02:44.195]  And Alex Jones, if you add the two podcasts together, he's probably the number one guest in any podcast in the history of podcasting.
[03:02:45.931 --> 03:02:51.714]  They're making Joe Rogan out to be some kind of alt-right, edgy, evil person.
[03:02:51.874 --> 03:02:53.854]  And it's just the furthest thing from the truth.
[03:02:54.175 --> 03:03:00.817]  The guy smokes medical-grade tobacco and enjoys adult beverages while on the podcast.
[03:03:01.058 --> 03:03:01.998]  That's his whole shtick.
[03:03:02.058 --> 03:03:02.998]  He is a fun guy.
[03:03:03.018 --> 03:03:07.840]  You go and you deliver whatever your belief system is for between two and four hours.
[03:03:08.181 --> 03:03:09.041]  That's his shtick.
[03:03:09.341 --> 03:03:10.863]  He gives people a platform.
[03:03:10.963 --> 03:03:13.505]  Left, right, center, apolitical.
[03:03:13.726 --> 03:03:16.188]  He had Andrew Yang on, the Democrat candidate.
[03:03:16.208 --> 03:03:20.533]  He wants to give everybody $1,000 a month to exist or something like that.
[03:03:21.253 --> 03:03:22.715]  He's clearly nonpartisan.
[03:03:22.775 --> 03:03:27.300]  He's clearly a free thinker, which of course Slate makes out to be a bad thing.
[03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:29.202]  But this is how the article then goes on.
[03:03:29.522 --> 03:03:30.122]  On February 7th,
[03:03:31.484 --> 03:03:42.556]  The 1241st episode of the podcast, comedian Joe Rogan kicked off a discussion of one of the single injustices of our time, the deplatforming of jerks on the internet.
[03:03:43.037 --> 03:03:47.522]  So you can already see the propaganda rabbit hole that this article is about to go down.
[03:03:47.842 --> 03:03:49.943]  You see, this isn't big tech censorship.
[03:03:50.223 --> 03:03:56.024]  This isn't demolishing and making light of and utterly destroying the First Amendment.
[03:03:56.344 --> 03:04:03.986]  This isn't five or ten people in Silicon Valley determining what everybody in the world gets to see.
[03:04:04.006 --> 03:04:05.467]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:04:05.767 --> 03:04:10.468]  We're just doing this 50-hour broadcast because of the deplatforming of jerks.
[03:04:11.028 --> 03:04:11.668]  On the internet.
[03:04:12.129 --> 03:04:13.709]  And Joe Rogan is now one of these jerks.
[03:04:14.189 --> 03:04:17.771]  I honestly, I do wonder, does Joe Rogan know this is going to happen?
[03:04:17.831 --> 03:04:18.631]  Surely he did.
[03:04:18.971 --> 03:04:24.593]  Surely that was why he was kind of backing away from his association with Alex Jones over these past few months.
[03:04:24.973 --> 03:04:26.234]  And I have to commend him.
[03:04:26.474 --> 03:04:28.475]  He is taking a serious risk here.
[03:04:28.495 --> 03:04:37.158]  He is being a true alpha male by standing by Alex Jones and standing by InfoWars and not even saying he implicitly agrees with everything Alex says.
[03:04:37.518 --> 03:04:39.019]  But just giving him a platform.
[03:04:39.279 --> 03:04:40.760]  This is such a tremendous risk.
[03:04:41.020 --> 03:04:46.522]  And here is the article that is the first real hit piece I've ever read on Joe Rogan.
[03:04:46.783 --> 03:04:48.623]  Somebody who the left typically loves.
[03:04:48.884 --> 03:04:49.764]  And with good reason.
[03:04:49.904 --> 03:04:51.305]  He is a classical liberal.
[03:04:51.585 --> 03:04:55.007]  He is somebody that we should all kind of admire in that regard.
[03:04:55.227 --> 03:04:59.229]  When we come back, I'm going to keep breaking it down and talk about this next wave of censorship.
[03:04:59.269 --> 03:05:00.970]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:01.150 --> 03:05:01.950]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[03:05:05.174 --> 03:05:14.598]  We're going to do, this Thursday through Friday through Saturday, a 50-hour emergency Save the First Amendment broadcast with a bunch of special guests and a bunch of stuff we've never done before.
[03:05:14.738 --> 03:05:15.879]  Believe me, this is going to be special.
[03:05:15.959 --> 03:05:16.839]  Thursday 8 a.m.
[03:05:16.859 --> 03:05:20.421]  with David Knight, right through Saturday 10 a.m., 50 hours, a bunch of special guests.
[03:05:20.541 --> 03:05:26.304]  We're going to blur out the violence, but we're going to look at all the anomalies, not even saying there's anomalies.
[03:05:26.444 --> 03:05:27.684]  We have a right to.
[03:05:27.884 --> 03:05:32.607]  The truth is, governments do do stuff like this, and it's legitimate for anybody to ask those type of questions.
[03:05:34.191 --> 03:05:36.933]  4D uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years, turmeric.
[03:05:36.993 --> 03:05:39.155]  It's one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[03:05:39.535 --> 03:05:44.879]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[03:05:45.059 --> 03:05:53.224]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[03:05:53.565 --> 03:05:58.508]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.
[03:05:59.049 --> 03:06:02.331]  Right now at InfoWarsStore.com, please support this network.
[03:06:05.881 --> 03:06:10.087]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:10.127 --> 03:06:13.693]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:21.508 --> 03:06:23.509]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:23.569 --> 03:06:24.970]  This is the fourth hour.
[03:06:24.990 --> 03:06:27.652]  I am Tom Paffert, Facebook's God-Emperor Trump.
[03:06:28.152 --> 03:06:32.115]  I help run one of InfowarsTV's affiliates here in Wichita, Kansas.
[03:06:32.155 --> 03:06:34.937]  I also write at BigLeaguePolitics.com.
[03:06:35.597 --> 03:06:42.342]  I'm just as disappointed, as I said in the last segment, as everyone else, that Joe Rogan's flight was delayed and he's not in studio yet.
[03:06:43.260 --> 03:06:45.482]  But there's lots of Joe Rogan news going on.
[03:06:45.582 --> 03:06:54.648]  The left has started its smear campaign against him and it came to us from Slate with the article titled, Joe Rogan's Galaxy Brain.
[03:06:55.048 --> 03:07:00.072]  Again, now Joe Rogan is one of these intellectual dark web people who is evil and must be stopped.
[03:07:00.092 --> 03:07:06.076]  He peddles hate and fear because he has people like Alex Jones on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.
[03:07:06.476 --> 03:07:10.779]  Let's continue picking out some gems from this four or five thousand word article.
[03:07:11.060 --> 03:07:14.983]  I just printed out here about a thousand words of it and it's still two pages.
[03:07:15.023 --> 03:07:16.904]  This is just all the relevant spicy parts.
[03:07:17.164 --> 03:07:28.593]  I honestly can't imagine anybody reads this drivel except now the right wing will because we're going to be shocked that just by having an association with Alex Jones you can now be essentially taken off of the internet.
[03:07:28.613 --> 03:07:29.834]  I mean that's what they want from this.
[03:07:29.934 --> 03:07:33.597]  It's very clear by the end of the article that's their entire goal.
[03:07:34.557 --> 03:07:38.619]  So, we left off with the deplatforming of jerks on the internet.
[03:07:38.639 --> 03:07:40.159]  They say that's all we're mad about.
[03:07:40.199 --> 03:07:42.360]  That's the reason for this 50-hour broadcast.
[03:07:42.400 --> 03:07:56.205]  Not to save the Constitution, to save the First Amendment, to prevent an unelected group of lunatics in Silicon Valley from determining what people can see, what people can read, what people can learn about, the knowledge that we get to obtain.
[03:07:56.405 --> 03:07:57.506]  No, we're not upset about that.
[03:07:57.526 --> 03:08:00.967]  We're upset because some bad people got deplatformed.
[03:08:01.227 --> 03:08:03.269]  And that makes us bad people as well.
[03:08:03.309 --> 03:08:07.212]  The propaganda is so comical on this left-wing website slate.
[03:08:07.652 --> 03:08:25.867]  So Rogan, of course, was against the deplatformization, the article continues, as was his guest, the author and podcaster Sam Harris, who urged Rogan's listeners to consider the plight of all the witty provocateurs who have lately begun to suffer real-life consequences for their trollish online banter.
[03:08:26.167 --> 03:08:28.228]  So you see, this is just so comical.
[03:08:28.589 --> 03:08:30.590]  It is such an on-the-face joke.
[03:08:30.970 --> 03:08:33.952]  Again, we're not upset because people are being taken down.
[03:08:34.112 --> 03:08:48.321]  Laura Loomer has the audacity to call out Ilhan Omar as somebody who may have illegally married her brother to smuggle him into the country as a rampant anti-Semite who says that Americans who say anything nice about Israel are controlled by them.
[03:08:48.681 --> 03:08:54.245]  She goes as far as just a couple days after a terrorist attack, she was posting a lot of Akbar on Twitter.
[03:08:54.865 --> 03:09:00.786]  That is just Laura Loomer being a trollish banter person, and she deserves to be banned.
[03:09:01.146 --> 03:09:05.647]  About the only one who falls into this is Milo Yiannopoulos, who was being a journalist.
[03:09:05.907 --> 03:09:13.689]  Of course, everybody saw that discussion on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and that's part of the reason why they want him gone.
[03:09:14.549 --> 03:09:21.390]  So the article goes on, the proximate cause of Harris's smarm was neither a teenager nor a Twitter troll.
[03:09:22.498 --> 03:09:25.100]  But an actor who had made it rather old-fashioned staying.
[03:09:25.180 --> 03:09:26.500]  They talk about Liam Neeson.
[03:09:27.021 --> 03:09:33.304]  That people wanted blood after Liam Neeson recalled being a teenager and wanting to hurt a black person on the street.
[03:09:33.665 --> 03:09:34.885]  People go out for blood for this.
[03:09:34.905 --> 03:09:38.127]  And they say, imagine what if Liam Neeson had been totally taken down.
[03:09:38.227 --> 03:09:39.788]  And to Slate, that would be a good thing.
[03:09:40.208 --> 03:09:42.330]  They want him excommunicated from society.
[03:09:42.430 --> 03:09:44.071]  He spoke wrong-think.
[03:09:44.171 --> 03:09:46.732]  He told an anecdote from when he was a child.
[03:09:47.112 --> 03:09:48.053]  He must go.
[03:09:49.505 --> 03:10:03.356]  Then the article begins to get to really the meat and potatoes of why people hate Alex Jones, why now they hate Joe Rogan, why they hate InfoWars, Owen Schroyer, David Knight, and it's because of something called authenticity.
[03:10:03.737 --> 03:10:05.038]  None of this is fake.
[03:10:05.338 --> 03:10:07.420]  I've been to the InfoWars studio before.
[03:10:07.620 --> 03:10:10.382]  I didn't see a teleprompter in the entire facility.
[03:10:10.702 --> 03:10:11.823]  I don't think they own them.
[03:10:11.883 --> 03:10:15.566]  I don't think anybody there knows how to run one, which is a phenomenal thing.
[03:10:16.007 --> 03:10:17.588]  Nobody there gets talking points.
[03:10:17.808 --> 03:10:24.511]  You don't have George Soros telling Alex Jones what to say every morning when he gets into the studio, which the left does have.
[03:10:24.571 --> 03:10:26.512]  They have media matters talking points.
[03:10:26.532 --> 03:10:31.835]  That's where they get their prescribed beliefs coming straight from the former Nazi himself.
[03:10:32.335 --> 03:10:34.396]  So this is quoted from the article.
[03:10:34.496 --> 03:10:38.478]  This is something that Tim Pool said to Joe Rogan on his recent appearance.
[03:10:38.718 --> 03:10:42.160]  He said, I think a lot of people look at you, you're like a real dude.
[03:10:42.420 --> 03:10:45.662]  The independent journalist Tim Pool told Rogan during a recent podcast.
[03:10:46.123 --> 03:10:47.906]  You know, your conversations are real.
[03:10:48.247 --> 03:10:54.420]  You're not one of these fake news journalists that people are very critical of, that they feel are biased or have an agenda.
[03:10:55.522 --> 03:10:57.306]  And that's what Slate is.
[03:10:57.799 --> 03:10:58.159]  Hates.
[03:10:58.819 --> 03:11:06.022]  They really dislike that Joe Rogan gets on there, possibly inebriated, who am I to judge, and just speaks his mind.
[03:11:06.242 --> 03:11:08.763]  And he allows his guests to speak their mind.
[03:11:09.063 --> 03:11:10.323]  And there is no censorship.
[03:11:10.343 --> 03:11:12.344]  There's no, you know, you can't talk about that topic.
[03:11:12.684 --> 03:11:13.525]  There's none of that.
[03:11:13.825 --> 03:11:20.547]  You go on and you see Alex Jones talk about everything from transdimensional pedophiles to big tech censorship.
[03:11:20.787 --> 03:11:22.208]  That's who Alex Jones is.
[03:11:22.388 --> 03:11:23.108]  And that's why
[03:11:23.697 --> 03:11:24.797]  He was on the podcast.
[03:11:25.038 --> 03:11:26.158]  But they don't like that.
[03:11:26.698 --> 03:11:29.800]  So, the article continues, Poole's assertion is half correct.
[03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:31.901]  Rogan is not a journalist.
[03:11:31.921 --> 03:11:33.141]  And he does not claim to be one.
[03:11:33.501 --> 03:11:37.223]  But Rogan's agenda, nevertheless, is very clear.
[03:11:37.463 --> 03:11:40.224]  You see, they make it out so Joe Rogan, see this is where it starts.
[03:11:40.444 --> 03:11:41.465]  He's some kind of Nazi.
[03:11:41.505 --> 03:11:44.946]  He's some kind of vile right wing white supremacist.
[03:11:45.187 --> 03:11:46.427]  He must be stopped!
[03:11:47.227 --> 03:11:52.790]  Rogan's podcast has become an important node, the article continues, in the intellectual dark web.
[03:11:53.399 --> 03:11:58.442]  Which is, by the way, one of the laziest terms I've ever heard created.
[03:11:58.722 --> 03:12:02.564]  The intellectual dark web is Jordan Peterson, Tim Pool.
[03:12:02.924 --> 03:12:12.269]  These really middle-of-the-road, mainstream-sounding voices that would have been five years ago completely within the box.
[03:12:12.570 --> 03:12:20.494]  The problem is the left has moved the Overton window so far into the radical leftist direction that a guy telling teenagers to clean their room
[03:12:20.954 --> 03:12:27.398]  Is now part of this spooky, scary, intellectual dark web that the Google CEO says we must clamp down on.
[03:12:27.758 --> 03:12:30.520]  And we would love to get rid of Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson.
[03:12:30.760 --> 03:12:34.502]  We just are waiting eagerly for them to break the community guidelines.
[03:12:35.894 --> 03:12:47.643]  So this loose network, they say, of quote, classical liberals, writers, scholars, and speakers who claim to have been marginalized by the elitist progressives intent on maintaining an identitarian orthodoxy.
[03:12:47.984 --> 03:12:55.790]  These people inveigh against political correctness and identity politics in publications like Quillette and on YouTube videos and one another's podcasts.
[03:12:56.611 --> 03:12:57.832]  Ooh, you can't have that.
[03:12:58.112 --> 03:13:00.173]  You can't have people talking to each other.
[03:13:00.233 --> 03:13:02.394]  That would just be the worst thing that's ever happened.
[03:13:02.895 --> 03:13:15.482]  They have no idea how ridiculous they sound, how inside their own little world they are, to seriously suggest that people talking on each other's shows is a bad thing, as if that's not what every mainstream leftist network is.
[03:13:16.983 --> 03:13:17.823]  The article goes on, No!
[03:13:39.264 --> 03:13:41.005]  How did they get this so blatantly wrong?
[03:13:41.325 --> 03:13:44.547]  We don't look at that as proof that we are being censored.
[03:13:44.567 --> 03:13:46.788]  We look at that as the obvious result.
[03:13:47.028 --> 03:13:48.029]  People are afraid.
[03:13:48.389 --> 03:13:49.469]  I mean, I don't know.
[03:13:49.529 --> 03:13:50.730]  I've never spoken to Joe Rogan.
[03:13:50.850 --> 03:13:59.474]  I think that there was a healthy amount of fear that an article like this would come out if he so much as touched the topic of big tech censorship with a 10-foot pole.
[03:13:59.775 --> 03:14:01.075]  And look, he was right!
[03:14:01.375 --> 03:14:08.199]  He had the audacity to defend Alex Jones, not even full-throatedly, but just say, hey, maybe Alex Jones isn't such a bad guy.
[03:14:08.599 --> 03:14:17.601]  Now he is part of the intellectual dark web, who is afraid of academia, and afraid of the media, because they're the ones telling the truth.
[03:14:17.881 --> 03:14:24.223]  And if you disagree with the media, then you must be a liar, and misinformed, and stupid!
[03:14:24.743 --> 03:14:28.284]  So let's fast forward a bit in the article, because they bury it.
[03:14:28.812 --> 03:14:34.462]  But I honestly believe this article was written because of Alex Jones' appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience.
[03:14:35.163 --> 03:14:41.134]  A recent interview with Alex Jones, the article continues, showcased the show's charms and frustrations.
[03:14:41.784 --> 03:14:55.916]  Jones had come on the podcast to bury the hatchet with Rogan, with whom he had been feuding over Jones' previous... this is where I'm gonna get red in the face angry... Jones' previous assertions that the Sandy Hook school shooting may not have actually happened.
[03:14:56.296 --> 03:15:00.479]  Nobody can provide clips, by the way, of Alex Jones ever saying that didn't happen.
[03:15:00.499 --> 03:15:03.582]  There may have been some guests, there may have been some callers, that type of thing.
[03:15:04.062 --> 03:15:08.044]  But nobody has ever been able to sit down and show me where Alex Jones said these things.
[03:15:08.304 --> 03:15:10.946]  And now, of course, for the past, what is this, 2019?
[03:15:11.286 --> 03:15:18.970]  For the past how many years has Alex Jones said, yes, it was a tragedy, it was horrifying, it was terrible, kids died, I wish it would stop happening.
[03:15:19.190 --> 03:15:25.613]  I wish the media would stop bringing it up, making these parents relive the terror and the horror every single time.
[03:15:26.113 --> 03:15:27.715]  But that is what the article says.
[03:15:27.915 --> 03:15:32.719]  That the media was doing their job by lying about Alex Jones and putting words in his mouth.
[03:15:32.979 --> 03:15:49.553]  And that Joe Rogan was doing a horrible disservice to the media, to real, real intellectuals all across the country by having the audacity to let Alex Jones explain that he has been framed for saying something he never said and they've used that as an excuse to purge him off the internet.
[03:15:50.433 --> 03:15:52.754]  And so now Joe Rogan must go.
[03:15:53.274 --> 03:15:54.114]  That is where they're at.
[03:15:54.134 --> 03:15:56.055]  We're gonna be back in just a minute.
[03:15:56.075 --> 03:15:58.436]  You're watching the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:58.556 --> 03:16:00.757]  I'm Tom Pappert, Facebook's God Emperor Trump.
[03:16:00.957 --> 03:16:02.298]  You're watching again the Alex Jones Show.
[03:16:04.118 --> 03:16:11.541]  There's been a paradox or a contradiction on the surface that many have noted in the last hundred years.
[03:16:12.621 --> 03:16:16.463]  Historians are confused by the fact that powerful British
[03:16:17.864 --> 03:16:19.445]  And European and U.S.
[03:16:19.706 --> 03:16:29.273]  robber barons of the 19th and 20th century, almost to a man, funded socialism and communism.
[03:16:30.074 --> 03:16:31.315]  People say that doesn't make sense.
[03:16:32.056 --> 03:16:39.322]  But Carol Quigley, the head of Georgetown Political Science, Bill Clinton's mentor back in the 1960s, wrote Tragedy and Hope.
[03:16:41.003 --> 03:16:41.904]  And in the 1100 page blueprint,
[03:16:44.542 --> 03:16:49.645]  He explains that we want fascism, we want communism, we want socialism, we want command and control.
[03:16:50.346 --> 03:16:54.709]  But our favorite system is socialism because it domesticates the people.
[03:16:55.089 --> 03:16:58.671]  But we want to have the illusion of left and right, we want to control both parties.
[03:16:59.852 --> 03:17:05.036]  So that people think they're having change, but really they move in the same direction towards vertical integration.
[03:17:05.576 --> 03:17:11.460]  So you have the big billionaires, the people controlling trillion dollar companies like Tim Cook at Apple and others.
[03:17:12.833 --> 03:17:27.040]  Who literally run the equivalent of slave factories in China, who help round up political dissidents, but they're everywhere lecturing you about Black Lives Matter and about how Trump hates Muslims and how altruistic and loving they are.
[03:17:27.841 --> 03:17:32.003]  Because if you look into what they pay in taxes, it's almost zero.
[03:17:32.463 --> 03:17:39.887]  And it's all the big tech companies have set it up with offshore accounts and other systems where they legally pay almost no tax.
[03:17:40.976 --> 03:17:48.239]  And the very same people lecture you and I, how if you're making $100,000 a year, you're rich, you're not paying enough money.
[03:17:48.259 --> 03:17:50.660]  If you're making $200,000 a year, you're in the 1%.
[03:17:50.800 --> 03:17:53.402]  And you're guilty and you're bad.
[03:17:54.942 --> 03:17:58.944]  No, the globalists are in the .0000000042, depending on the analysis you do.
[03:17:59.284 --> 03:18:03.946]  That tiny percentage of a percentage controls over half the wealth.
[03:18:09.324 --> 03:18:11.566]  And they're maneuvering things towards a monopoly.
[03:18:11.606 --> 03:18:13.187]  They want to get rid of middle classes.
[03:18:13.227 --> 03:18:23.335]  They want to get rid of real free market systems that threaten them with innovation and new companies and new ideas and new leaders and new savants that come along.
[03:18:24.355 --> 03:18:31.817]  So they're creating a classical system, a two-tiered system, where the elite are on top, the people are on the bottom, and there's no middle class.
[03:18:32.417 --> 03:18:42.601]  That's the globalist aim, selling you on austerity, selling you on being poor, telling you your carbon footprint's evil, but AOC and the rest of them fly around on private jets and wear $3,000-plus outfits.
[03:18:44.381 --> 03:18:46.602]  All they tell us is capitalism is a failure.
[03:18:47.002 --> 03:18:48.383]  It isn't capitalism that's a failure.
[03:18:48.883 --> 03:18:58.847]  It's crony capitalism, using socialism and communism to control us, that is working beautifully for this world fascist system they've set up.
[03:18:59.387 --> 03:19:07.010]  It's corporate fascism using crony capitalism to dodge the taxes, to be above the law, diplomatic immunity, dominating humanity.
[03:19:07.511 --> 03:19:09.351]  And that's why they demonize info wars.
[03:19:09.852 --> 03:19:12.893]  If you read the Clinton Foundation documents, the Judicial Watch sued and died.
[03:19:14.754 --> 03:19:21.260]  They're talking in the early 90s about we can't let right-wingers or nationalists ever create their own economy.
[03:19:21.600 --> 03:19:26.725]  If they sell a book or have a magazine or open a company, we've got to say it's evil and shut it down.
[03:19:28.677 --> 03:19:30.097]  We can't let them have a community.
[03:19:30.137 --> 03:19:31.518]  We can't let them create their own economy.
[03:19:31.818 --> 03:19:35.959]  That's why when you go to InfoWarsTore.com, you don't just get amazing products.
[03:19:36.560 --> 03:19:39.781]  You're funding the second American Revolution that's going worldwide.
[03:19:40.121 --> 03:19:42.702]  The very bane of the tyrants that you have a choice.
[03:19:43.322 --> 03:19:46.283]  We have StoreWide 50% off right now, and we've got
[03:19:47.210 --> 03:19:49.632]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:15.165 --> 03:20:17.947]  FACT!
[03:20:19.068 --> 03:20:25.072]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:25.312 --> 03:20:27.613]  I'm Tom Paffert, the guest host for this hour.
[03:20:27.673 --> 03:20:31.316]  Facebook's got him for Trump to follow me on Twitter and elsewhere as well.
[03:20:33.257 --> 03:20:38.181]  So we've been talking about the left's now attempt to get rid of Joe Rogan.
[03:20:38.282 --> 03:20:40.684]  He's friends with Alex Jones, so he has to go.
[03:20:40.764 --> 03:20:45.168]  And the big tech censorship has been ongoing now for two years, non-stop.
[03:20:45.228 --> 03:20:46.629]  Nobody is really standing in the way.
[03:20:46.669 --> 03:20:49.151]  The president appears that he finally may act.
[03:20:49.511 --> 03:20:52.114]  Don Jr., of course, is writing off ads condemning it.
[03:20:53.527 --> 03:20:56.008]  What will happen is what I want to know.
[03:20:56.228 --> 03:20:58.349]  If they're successful, if they get rid of everybody.
[03:20:58.389 --> 03:21:10.592]  You heard on the Alex Jones Show earlier today, CEO of Google laughs about the idea of getting rid of Ben Shapiro, who as middle of the road, he was a neocon, never Trump loser.
[03:21:10.652 --> 03:21:12.453]  And I mean, he still is half the time.
[03:21:12.793 --> 03:21:14.534]  Every other day he's disappointed in Trump.
[03:21:14.554 --> 03:21:16.294]  But even he has to go.
[03:21:16.634 --> 03:21:18.835]  Even he is too far to the right
[03:21:19.597 --> 03:21:22.260]  For the big tech overlords.
[03:21:22.320 --> 03:21:26.085]  So what happens in a world where they get their way?
[03:21:26.105 --> 03:21:26.865]  What do we have left?
[03:21:26.905 --> 03:21:27.887]  We have Fox News.
[03:21:28.447 --> 03:21:29.528]  We have Fox Business.
[03:21:30.089 --> 03:21:32.332]  I guess we're going to have to resort to smoke signals.
[03:21:32.372 --> 03:21:34.274]  Maybe Elizabeth Warren can help us out with that.
[03:21:35.123 --> 03:21:37.984]  And let's look at the character of Fox News, shall we?
[03:21:38.004 --> 03:21:42.045]  The people who, of course, Judge Jeanine Pirro has been suspended now.
[03:21:42.086 --> 03:21:44.486]  I think she's under second or third week of suspension.
[03:21:44.686 --> 03:21:46.387]  There's no real end date in sight.
[03:21:46.467 --> 03:21:48.948]  They claim she'll be back, but nobody is convinced.
[03:21:49.428 --> 03:22:00.372]  Tucker Carlson, of course, is, we're all living in fear that he's going to be thrown under the bus by his own network because of remarks he said 15 or 20 years ago on a comedy show on the radio.
[03:22:01.952 --> 03:22:08.834]  And meanwhile, we broke a story today at BigLeaguePolitics.com that is downright disturbing.
[03:22:09.534 --> 03:22:15.296]  And what's even more disturbing is that Fox News has remained totally silent, as has the majority of the mainstream media.
[03:22:15.336 --> 03:22:29.561]  But in exclusive audio, Shepard Smith has a man who is accusing him of sexually attacking him in the middle of the night, and says he kept going after he tried to push Shepard off.
[03:22:30.976 --> 03:22:34.019]  Fox News, again, has said nothing about this.
[03:22:34.299 --> 03:22:36.060]  They have not commented on it publicly.
[03:22:36.341 --> 03:22:39.723]  They will not respond to Big League Politics' request for comment.
[03:22:39.964 --> 03:22:42.186]  They are just hoping this does go away.
[03:22:42.906 --> 03:22:44.527]  And they don't have to worry about it.
[03:22:45.308 --> 03:22:53.135]  Again, Judge Jeanine points out that maybe you can't uphold Sharia law and follow the Constitution at the same time.
[03:22:53.675 --> 03:22:54.596]  Oh, she's gotta go.
[03:22:54.656 --> 03:22:55.457]  She's in trouble.
[03:22:55.497 --> 03:22:56.618]  She needs to apologize.
[03:22:56.658 --> 03:22:59.200]  The network needs to condemn her statement.
[03:23:00.071 --> 03:23:05.919]  Tucker Carlson makes some funny jokes on a radio show and the network is just conspicuously silent.
[03:23:06.720 --> 03:23:08.102]  Tucker hasn't tweeted in days.
[03:23:09.944 --> 03:23:14.931]  A man comes forward saying that their host sexually assaulted him, allegedly.
[03:23:15.626 --> 03:23:16.826]  No comment.
[03:23:17.166 --> 03:23:17.547]  Nothing.
[03:23:17.747 --> 03:23:18.547]  Bury the story.
[03:23:18.587 --> 03:23:19.927]  So let's read a little bit from this.
[03:23:20.207 --> 03:23:28.310]  A man told his story to Big League Politics about an encounter with Fox News host Shep Smith in 2004 in New York City.
[03:23:28.690 --> 03:23:43.074]  The man describes how he woke up with Smith on top of him, with his tongue down his throat, how he tried to push the Fox host off him, and how Smith lunged at him three or four more times while continuing to force the unwanted physical encounter.
[03:23:44.458 --> 03:23:49.683]  And we could play the audio, but it's frankly a little bit disturbing, and I don't think it's appropriate for a family broadcast.
[03:23:49.703 --> 03:23:52.405]  But I'll read some of the less incendiary quotes.
[03:23:53.246 --> 03:24:04.516]  John Doe, number one, says he met up with Smith at the now-defunct Nation Bar in Manhattan, a spot Smith used to frequent to play Golden Tee and hang out when he was not on the Fox Airwaves.
[03:24:04.556 --> 03:24:04.997]  That's right!
[03:24:05.497 --> 03:24:10.482]  This alleged attack happened when Shepard Smith was already employed at Fox News.
[03:24:11.042 --> 03:24:19.308]  You can't even play the game that there are with Tucker, where CNN says, well, he wasn't really, he wasn't doing that on our dime.
[03:24:19.628 --> 03:24:22.550]  And then Fox News says, well, that was before we ever even met Tucker.
[03:24:22.590 --> 03:24:23.371]  So it's okay.
[03:24:23.451 --> 03:24:23.651]  No.
[03:24:24.091 --> 03:24:26.453]  This happened on Fox News' watch.
[03:24:27.394 --> 03:24:28.074]  He said this.
[03:24:28.614 --> 03:24:32.457]  I wake up and Shepard is on top of me, like in a towel or a bathrobe.
[03:24:32.697 --> 03:24:35.399]  And he's got his tongue down my throat and his hands all over me.
[03:24:35.699 --> 03:24:36.880]  Completely uninvited.
[03:24:36.920 --> 03:24:38.301]  I mean, I gave him no signal.
[03:24:38.461 --> 03:24:39.422]  There was nothing.
[03:24:40.509 --> 03:24:43.350]  He continued, I had also volunteered to sleep in the spare.
[03:24:43.450 --> 03:24:46.351]  So it wasn't, I never invited myself to his bedroom.
[03:24:46.831 --> 03:24:47.571]  I pushed him off.
[03:24:47.611 --> 03:24:48.992]  I was like, dude, what are you doing?
[03:24:49.592 --> 03:24:51.293]  And Shepard responded, what?
[03:24:51.393 --> 03:24:52.153]  You don't like it?
[03:24:54.294 --> 03:25:00.516]  And then he kept going three or four more times, groping allegedly this guy.
[03:25:01.956 --> 03:25:03.737]  That is absolutely sickening.
[03:25:04.377 --> 03:25:07.718]  And again, just think of what happened with Kavanaugh.
[03:25:08.803 --> 03:25:10.344]  The woman refused to come forward.
[03:25:10.384 --> 03:25:13.206]  She finally did, but only under certain circumstances.
[03:25:13.246 --> 03:25:15.267]  The left wing just sat there and coddled her.
[03:25:15.707 --> 03:25:24.773]  But then, with Shepard Smith, we break this insane story that, if true, is repugnant, and everybody is silent about it.
[03:25:25.033 --> 03:25:26.054]  Everybody is ignoring it.
[03:25:26.094 --> 03:25:32.118]  Again, I have to thank the InfoWars team for allowing me to come on and talk about it today, because it is disgusting!
[03:25:33.479 --> 03:25:37.724]  He continues, there was this like kind of no, and he kept going.
[03:25:37.784 --> 03:25:41.508]  He kept pushing, like pushing his hands in all these spots.
[03:25:41.808 --> 03:25:43.309]  He was just on top of me.
[03:25:44.331 --> 03:25:49.716]  He said the experience was definitely shocking and noted that he finally stopped, but it took a lot.
[03:25:49.856 --> 03:25:53.160]  It wasn't an immediate no, then everything was like, oh, sorry.
[03:25:54.588 --> 03:25:57.330]  He said that again, three or four times, he lunged at him.
[03:25:57.370 --> 03:26:00.772]  And then, finally, allegedly, Shepard Smith left him alone.
[03:26:01.353 --> 03:26:05.816]  The next morning, he wakes up at around six in the morning, and he's just trying to get out of the apartment.
[03:26:06.096 --> 03:26:09.938]  Shepard Smith corners him in the kitchen, drinking a beer.
[03:26:10.339 --> 03:26:14.241]  Alleged, again, this is the story that was relayed to Big League politics.
[03:26:16.082 --> 03:26:22.787]  So he corners him in the kitchen, drinking a beer, six in the morning, says, no, no, no, don't leave.
[03:26:23.499 --> 03:26:24.159]  Go with me.
[03:26:24.679 --> 03:26:26.060]  Drive to the airport with me.
[03:26:26.100 --> 03:26:32.502]  Then my Fox News paid for driver, I'm sure, will drive you home so we can spend more time together.
[03:26:32.542 --> 03:26:36.444]  And the guy is freaked out, but he didn't feel physically threatened at the time.
[03:26:36.944 --> 03:26:38.704]  So he said, OK, I'll ride with you.
[03:26:38.744 --> 03:26:46.687]  And then Shepard allegedly forced himself on this guy again and kissed him again and put his tongue down his throat again.
[03:26:48.188 --> 03:26:49.148]  Where is the outrage?
[03:26:49.890 --> 03:26:54.014]  Is it because Shepard Smith is one of Fox News' Never Trump cohorts?
[03:26:55.034 --> 03:26:58.557]  Is it because this is from Big League Politics?
[03:26:58.918 --> 03:27:03.181]  The same people who broke the Ralph Northam KKK blackface scandal?
[03:27:04.242 --> 03:27:05.203]  Where is the outrage?
[03:27:05.463 --> 03:27:09.226]  Why is everybody not beating down the door of Rupert Murdoch?
[03:27:09.507 --> 03:27:10.467]  Or I'm sorry, his son now.
[03:27:11.148 --> 03:27:12.149]  And of course, I mean that.
[03:27:13.047 --> 03:27:14.588]  Not literally, but politically.
[03:27:15.049 --> 03:27:19.372]  Why are people not banging down the doors of Fox News trying to get answers?
[03:27:19.673 --> 03:27:20.733]  Trying to get a statement?
[03:27:21.034 --> 03:27:25.858]  Where are the calls for Shepard Smith to be fired or at least investigated over these claims?
[03:27:26.218 --> 03:27:28.220]  What if there are other victims over the years?
[03:27:28.740 --> 03:27:33.264]  What if there are other accusers that want to step forward but feel that they won't have an audience?
[03:27:34.306 --> 03:27:56.239]  Nobody wants to talk about this, and I find that utterly disturbing that the network, who will basically can, one of their longest hosts, a kind lady, Judge Jeanine, has a show one day a week, and she pointed out that, hey, maybe it's not very possible to keep Sharia law at the same time you want to uphold the Constitution.
[03:27:56.259 --> 03:27:57.639]  Maybe that's a contradiction.
[03:27:57.940 --> 03:27:59.200]  Maybe you need to choose one.
[03:27:59.561 --> 03:28:00.361]  Oh, that's terrible.
[03:28:00.401 --> 03:28:01.162]  She needs to go.
[03:28:01.242 --> 03:28:02.282]  She's in big trouble.
[03:28:02.342 --> 03:28:03.583]  She's in big, big trouble.
[03:28:04.395 --> 03:28:07.676]  You've got Lindsey Graham on Sean Hannity almost every night.
[03:28:07.716 --> 03:28:11.897]  I'm ready to just call it the Lindsey Graham Hour with occasional guest host Sean Hannity.
[03:28:12.297 --> 03:28:21.299]  You've got Laura Ingraham who has been forced to apologize and had advertisers drop her show after maybe suggesting David Hogg was not the most honest person in the world.
[03:28:21.459 --> 03:28:22.179]  God forbid.
[03:28:23.679 --> 03:28:25.060]  Now we have a real scandal.
[03:28:25.680 --> 03:28:29.301]  The first real scandal to hit Fox News in I don't know when.
[03:28:30.781 --> 03:28:30.901]  And
[03:28:31.331 --> 03:28:32.112]  What is the response?
[03:28:32.152 --> 03:28:33.053]  Again, it's crickets.
[03:28:33.373 --> 03:28:34.594]  Nobody wants to talk about it.
[03:28:34.894 --> 03:28:40.519]  Shepard Smith allegedly forcing himself on a younger man who weighed 35 pounds less than him.
[03:28:41.562 --> 03:28:43.003]  The story sounds credible.
[03:28:43.043 --> 03:28:46.406]  The audio is up at BigLeaguePolitics.com.
[03:28:46.426 --> 03:28:49.589]  You can evaluate for yourself, but it was disgusting.
[03:28:49.649 --> 03:28:53.072]  I felt my stomach churn as I listened to the man relay this incident.
[03:28:53.393 --> 03:28:54.814]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:55.174 --> 03:29:07.445]  We'll be right back after this with more coverage on Fox News and what the future without Alex Jones, without any real... It's so important.
[03:29:08.186 --> 03:29:11.530]  For everyone to remember, without you financially supporting us, we're not here.
[03:29:11.970 --> 03:29:22.362]  And The Globalist, amongst all the other shows out there, they want this one shut down because we're spot on, we give wide spectrum analysis, we don't go with a talking point, we just have a real debate until we figure out what's going on.
[03:29:22.402 --> 03:29:23.102]  So please don't forget.

[03:32:02.000 --> 03:32:05.603]  We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:05.643 --> 03:32:06.403]  We really would not.
[03:32:06.504 --> 03:32:10.547]  And they thought that they had it all planned out that they could destroy InfoWars.
[03:32:10.667 --> 03:32:14.710]  They really thought they had the numbers and the audience trumped them again.
[03:32:14.910 --> 03:32:16.291]  And so you come through every time.
[03:32:16.351 --> 03:32:17.432]  So I can't thank you enough.
[03:32:17.592 --> 03:32:19.834]  I've met so many of you out there on the road.
[03:32:20.034 --> 03:32:22.636]  I know I'll meet so many more of you before it's all said and done.
[03:32:22.816 --> 03:32:37.990]  So I just salute you, I thank you for your support, and you just have our word, you have our pledge, that we will remain steadfast in this battle for the future, in this battle for the republic, in this battle for reality, in this battle for logic and reasoning, really, is what it comes down to at the end of the day.
[03:32:38.050 --> 03:32:39.572]  So, I just want to thank the audience.
[03:32:40.112 --> 03:32:43.253]  And just thank you for your support at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:43.553 --> 03:32:46.733]  If you've never been to Infowarsstore.com, go check it out, folks.
[03:32:47.153 --> 03:32:48.554]  You're going to find something there you like.
[03:32:48.574 --> 03:32:49.934]  You're going to find something there you need.
[03:32:50.054 --> 03:32:54.915]  Air filters, water filters, toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, body wash, all kinds of supplements.
[03:32:54.975 --> 03:32:56.995]  It's all at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:33:06.157 --> 03:33:08.778]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.502 --> 03:33:22.388]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:22.528 --> 03:33:30.399]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:33.991 --> 03:33:36.173]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:36.313 --> 03:33:49.584]  I am Tom Papper filling in for Alex for the fourth hour here during this monumental 50-hour live broadcast to stop big tech censorship and protect, to save really, the First Amendment.
[03:33:49.644 --> 03:33:57.991]  So I want to remind everybody that the reason why we're all on the air, the reason why we can do this, me as my own independent person, Alex Jones and InfoWars,
[03:33:58.311 --> 03:33:59.733]  It's because people support us.
[03:34:00.173 --> 03:34:03.477]  We don't get big checks from George Soros.
[03:34:03.537 --> 03:34:07.221]  We don't get dark money from the DNC.
[03:34:07.462 --> 03:34:09.544]  We don't get dark money from the RNC.
[03:34:09.684 --> 03:34:12.607]  There is no right-wing George Soros, and if there were...
[03:34:13.208 --> 03:34:13.748]  Maybe there is.
[03:34:13.808 --> 03:34:15.369]  Maybe that's how Ben Shapiro stays afloat.
[03:34:15.650 --> 03:34:18.872]  But if there were, Alex Jones wouldn't want to take his money.
[03:34:19.252 --> 03:34:22.894]  He doesn't want to be shut up by anybody in the media.
[03:34:22.934 --> 03:34:24.195]  He doesn't want puppet masters.
[03:34:24.555 --> 03:34:30.619]  And that's why it's so important to go to InfoWarsTore.com and take advantage of some of the insane deals going on right now.
[03:34:30.979 --> 03:34:32.661]  You can see I've got my alpha power here.
[03:34:32.701 --> 03:34:37.685]  I was just telling in the break, I was telling some of the crew, I finally ran out of super male vitality.
[03:34:38.025 --> 03:34:41.488]  And if I were smart, I would go and get more while supply still lasts.
[03:34:41.528 --> 03:34:44.410]  Because once it's gone, my understanding is it's gone.
[03:34:44.831 --> 03:34:49.695]  And you can go find video of me from when I was in the InfoWars studio this last summer.
[03:34:50.075 --> 03:34:51.917]  And man, has it had an impact.
[03:34:51.977 --> 03:34:52.618]  It really does.
[03:34:52.718 --> 03:35:05.372]  As Owen and everyone else says, it gives you the extra energy, the extra drive, the extra fire you need every single day to make it to the gym, to work out, to go for a run, to go to the park, to get things done that you just don't have.
[03:35:05.692 --> 03:35:11.779]  And I mean, if you're like me, if you're like, I'm guessing Alex and Owen and everyone else, sleep is not necessarily the best thing.
[03:35:12.395 --> 03:35:13.677]  Which is why you need Knockout.
[03:35:14.178 --> 03:35:24.011]  And when you finally are ready to shut off all the screens that program your brain, that actually, when you stare at a computer screen all day, or you stare at these TV lights all day, that's what it's doing.
[03:35:24.051 --> 03:35:25.033]  It's programming your brain.
[03:35:25.153 --> 03:35:25.894]  It's daytime!
[03:35:26.034 --> 03:35:26.975]  It's light out!
[03:35:27.276 --> 03:35:28.077]  It's morning!
[03:35:28.277 --> 03:35:29.279]  Go out and work!
[03:35:29.879 --> 03:35:37.565]  And then when it comes time at 10 or 11 or 12 at night, when you've got to go get some sleep so you can be recharged for the next day, your brain can't do it.
[03:35:38.065 --> 03:35:39.486]  That's why Knockout exists.
[03:35:39.827 --> 03:35:46.872]  That's why all of the InfoWars products exist, because we need them to live in this horrible society that the globalists have created for us.
[03:35:47.172 --> 03:35:48.313]  You have to use this stuff.
[03:35:48.653 --> 03:35:54.957]  And I honestly cannot say enough good things about Supermail Vitality, about Alpha Power, about Knockout.
[03:35:55.197 --> 03:35:58.320]  I have an Alexa ProPure air filter in my apartment.
[03:35:58.600 --> 03:36:03.743]  I live in a 110-year-old building, and believe me, it's made a tremendous difference in my breathing.
[03:36:04.984 --> 03:36:08.626]  Can't say enough nice things about... What is it here?
[03:36:09.007 --> 03:36:11.368]  I actually have it hidden behind me, believe it or not.
[03:36:11.428 --> 03:36:13.410]  More products hidden right here on the set.
[03:36:13.730 --> 03:36:18.293]  Survival Shield X2, which I understand is recently back in stock.
[03:36:19.284 --> 03:36:28.957]  After the rare earth crystals became harder and harder to find, the oil companies hilariously had InfoWars over a barrel trying to get them to basically pay whatever they could get.
[03:36:29.358 --> 03:36:31.220]  And some hard negotiating.
[03:36:31.260 --> 03:36:34.064]  I guess Alex Jones has read the art of the deal once or twice.
[03:36:34.344 --> 03:36:37.265]  It looks like it's now back and at a reasonable price.
[03:36:37.545 --> 03:36:39.826]  Can't say enough nice things about all these products.
[03:36:39.866 --> 03:36:43.887]  Of course, the flagship product, Brain Force, is one of my all time favorites.
[03:36:44.267 --> 03:36:50.149]  You don't get the shakes, you don't get jittery, you can think clearly, and you have all the wonderful effects of a
[03:36:50.982 --> 03:36:51.603]  Neutropic.
[03:36:51.923 --> 03:36:54.725]  So I can't say enough nice things about InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:36:54.845 --> 03:36:55.625]  It is tremendous.
[03:36:55.726 --> 03:36:58.127]  Everything I've ever ordered, nothing has ever let me down.
[03:36:58.448 --> 03:37:00.569]  Occasionally, you get some free stickers in the box.
[03:37:00.609 --> 03:37:05.112]  Occasionally, when it's Christmas time, he'll give you a t-shirt as a gift.
[03:37:05.413 --> 03:37:07.854]  I have a wonderful t-shirt that's anti-gun control.
[03:37:07.874 --> 03:37:12.718]  It has Stalin, and I think Che, and Hitler, and it says, they all took the guns.
[03:37:13.154 --> 03:37:16.697]  From the iconic appearance on Piers Morgan's old CNN show.
[03:37:16.977 --> 03:37:19.179]  Cannot say enough nice things.
[03:37:19.379 --> 03:37:20.240]  Buy the products.
[03:37:20.560 --> 03:37:21.621]  You know you need them.
[03:37:21.882 --> 03:37:23.323]  It supports the InfoWar.
[03:37:23.583 --> 03:37:25.385]  It keeps InfoWars expanding.
[03:37:25.665 --> 03:37:29.909]  It keeps them looking for affiliates like KCTU, TV5 in Wichita, Kansas.
[03:37:30.209 --> 03:37:32.071]  It keeps the machine growing.
[03:37:32.551 --> 03:37:34.513]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:37:35.153 --> 03:37:37.916]  So we've been talking now about this
[03:37:39.093 --> 03:37:40.274]  Horrifying world.
[03:37:40.354 --> 03:37:47.438]  What it would look like if we had no real conservatives talking on YouTube, in podcasts, on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram.
[03:37:47.678 --> 03:37:52.220]  What if everybody went down the memory hole along with Alex Jones?
[03:37:52.240 --> 03:37:57.103]  And of course, it's a bit of a joke to even suggest that because Alex Jones, he has millions of listeners.
[03:37:57.123 --> 03:37:59.584]  You guys out there listening, you're sitting there thinking, what are you talking about?
[03:37:59.625 --> 03:38:00.545]  I never stopped listening.
[03:38:00.785 --> 03:38:03.947]  I'm not going to listen to Mark Zuckerberg and Susan at Google and
[03:38:04.227 --> 03:38:05.208]  And Jack Dorsey?
[03:38:05.248 --> 03:38:06.349]  These people can't tell me.
[03:38:06.409 --> 03:38:08.870]  Tim Cook can't tell me what information I will find.
[03:38:08.910 --> 03:38:12.093]  But it's now harder for Alex Jones to reach new people.
[03:38:12.553 --> 03:38:16.096]  It's now harder for more people to understand the importance of fighting the InfoWar.
[03:38:16.136 --> 03:38:17.437]  And that's their real goal.
[03:38:18.017 --> 03:38:19.078]  They want to cut us off.
[03:38:20.231 --> 03:38:27.599]  If you go all the way back to 2015 or 16 when Matt Drudge appeared on InfoWars, this is precisely what he predicted would happen.
[03:38:27.900 --> 03:38:31.203]  We're gonna have digital ghettos, is what he said.
[03:38:31.524 --> 03:38:38.071]  You will be herded into a tiny and ever-increasing, or decreasing, I should say, in size, digital ghetto.
[03:38:38.809 --> 03:38:41.750]  And they've now placed InfoWars and Alex Jones in a digital ghetto.
[03:38:41.991 --> 03:38:44.132]  You can still find their content, if you know how.
[03:38:44.432 --> 03:38:47.653]  If you're plugged in, if you're an InfoWarrior, you can tell other people.
[03:38:48.113 --> 03:38:53.416]  You can still share their articles, though it will be de-boosted in the Facebook News Feed.
[03:38:54.296 --> 03:38:56.217]  You can still download the app on Android.
[03:38:56.577 --> 03:39:01.540]  Those of us who were lucky enough to get it before it was kicked off can still see it on iOS.
[03:39:02.760 --> 03:39:03.881]  But they're limiting growth.
[03:39:04.395 --> 03:39:06.277]  Nobody wants to wander into the ghetto.
[03:39:06.557 --> 03:39:15.904]  As I talked about at the beginning of the fourth hour, even Joe Rogan, an absolute alpha male, probably was a little bit hesitant to even put a toe in the ghetto.
[03:39:16.365 --> 03:39:23.891]  Because once you associate with somebody who has been ostracized, who has been put into this little containment zone, well then what happens?
[03:39:24.431 --> 03:39:33.679]  And I do have to commend Alex Jones for building InfoWarsStore.com, for building InfoWars, for building this massive machine that has taken 20 years to create, because
[03:39:34.651 --> 03:39:35.292]  It is brilliant.
[03:39:35.952 --> 03:39:38.354]  They've done what everybody thought would never happen.
[03:39:38.374 --> 03:39:39.314]  They tried to kick him off.
[03:39:39.354 --> 03:39:40.495]  They tried to deperson him.
[03:39:40.515 --> 03:39:42.076]  They went after him with his family.
[03:39:42.096 --> 03:39:43.617]  They went after him with his money.
[03:39:43.657 --> 03:39:45.038]  They went after him with his livelihood.
[03:39:45.058 --> 03:39:46.159]  They went after him online.
[03:39:46.179 --> 03:39:48.861]  They're going after him in every single dimension that they can.
[03:39:48.921 --> 03:39:54.184]  It's a multi-fronted war against InfoWars, and yet still he holds strong.
[03:39:54.505 --> 03:39:56.586]  Still he can do a 50-hour broadcast.
[03:39:56.606 --> 03:39:58.027]  Still he can do all these wonderful things.
[03:39:58.047 --> 03:40:03.631]  That's because, unlike me, he's not dependent on the big tech platforms.
[03:40:04.286 --> 03:40:15.989]  And those of us who are, to reach people, to have an impact on the world, to move that needle an inch in the right direction, and we depend on Facebook and Google and Twitter, it's frankly horrifying.
[03:40:16.409 --> 03:40:30.793]  So my hat is off to Alex Jones and InfoWars for having their own platform and for not using it to totally K. How many times could Alex Jones have probably saved his head over the years, proverbially,
[03:40:31.630 --> 03:40:33.632]  If he would have just thrown Trump under the bus.
[03:40:34.033 --> 03:40:35.414]  Or if he would have just done this.
[03:40:35.475 --> 03:40:38.378]  Or if he would have just said, uh, fluoride is good.
[03:40:38.398 --> 03:40:40.260]  Or if he would have just said any number of things.
[03:40:40.420 --> 03:40:43.804]  I like the drag queen's story hour.
[03:40:44.144 --> 03:40:48.149]  If he would just say that today, maybe he could get back on Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
[03:40:48.269 --> 03:40:48.790]  Who knows?
[03:40:49.991 --> 03:40:51.433]  Meanwhile, you have Fox News.
[03:40:51.892 --> 03:40:54.493]  Which is supposed to be the conservative stalwart network.
[03:40:54.513 --> 03:40:56.134]  It's supposed to be protecting our interests.
[03:40:56.154 --> 03:40:58.615]  It's supposed to be giving the other side of America's opinions.
[03:40:58.635 --> 03:41:04.397]  It's supposed to be something that real, normal people can sit there and watch and enjoy.
[03:41:05.158 --> 03:41:10.460]  And then you have this morning, Maria Bartiromo, however she says her name,
[03:41:11.144 --> 03:41:18.265]  Had this CNN-tier interview with President Trump in which she just repeatedly brings up John McCain.
[03:41:18.305 --> 03:41:20.666]  President Trump didn't want to mention John McCain.
[03:41:20.706 --> 03:41:25.307]  You can clearly tell in the video, but just over and over and over again.
[03:41:25.627 --> 03:41:26.987]  Why did you attack John McCain?
[03:41:27.027 --> 03:41:28.408]  Don't you think he's a war hero?
[03:41:28.648 --> 03:41:30.148]  Why do you keep attacking the dead?
[03:41:30.408 --> 03:41:31.568]  Isn't that disrespectful?
[03:41:31.768 --> 03:41:32.388]  How dare you?
[03:41:32.588 --> 03:41:33.969]  Why don't you like John McCain?
[03:41:35.109 --> 03:41:35.249]  It's...
[03:41:35.948 --> 03:41:40.912]  Seriously, something that two or three years ago, we would have seen on CNN or MSNBC.
[03:41:41.132 --> 03:41:43.073]  And now, it's Fox News.
[03:41:43.574 --> 03:41:54.462]  The same network that put Paul Ryan, who is the reason why we didn't get a big, beautiful border wall much, much sooner, Paul Ryan is now on Fox Corp's Board of Directors.
[03:41:55.503 --> 03:42:03.449]  Because of course, after it split with the Disney acquisition, Fox News is still its own independent company under the umbrella of Fox Corp.
[03:42:04.119 --> 03:42:05.480]  Now Paul Ryan's involved.
[03:42:05.860 --> 03:42:20.772]  The same network that hired Donna Brazile, who dedicated her new book, shockingly, to Seth Rich, who gave Hillary Clinton the debate question so she could prepare and get an edge on the other Democrats.
[03:42:21.612 --> 03:42:26.336]  How anybody can support Fox News at this point is absolutely beyond me.
[03:42:26.966 --> 03:42:33.691]  When we get back, I want to talk about Sean Hannity sucking up and kissing up to this disgusting person, Donna Brazile.
[03:42:33.971 --> 03:42:39.675]  This unethical person who is so unethical and dishonest, CNN severed ties with her.
[03:42:40.495 --> 03:42:42.556]  She's now up at Fox News.
[03:42:42.716 --> 03:42:44.436]  Maybe that's a better home for her at this point.
[03:42:44.456 --> 03:42:53.240]  Maybe Fox News has been spending years and years and years becoming the quote-unquote conservative network so they could one day turn around and stab us in the back.
[03:42:53.720 --> 03:42:55.120]  I think that might be where we're going.
[03:42:55.140 --> 03:42:59.542]  So one more time, I want to remind everybody, InfoboreStore.com supports the Infobore.
[03:42:59.642 --> 03:43:00.962]  We'll be right back in just a minute.
[03:43:01.062 --> 03:43:02.243]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:43:02.663 --> 03:43:09.349]  It's been months and months and months since we've been able to have store-wide free shipping and Forestore.com.
[03:43:09.969 --> 03:43:18.956]  And it's been months and months since we were able to offer 50% off on our best-selling products because many of them sold out at the end of the year.
[03:43:19.837 --> 03:43:23.020]  We've gotten almost all of our best-selling products back in stock.
[03:43:24.020 --> 03:43:28.144]  And so now, for the second half of the month of March, we are going to be able to offer
[03:43:29.904 --> 03:43:35.126]  50% off all our best-selling products at fullwarslife.com, all the supplements.
[03:43:35.186 --> 03:43:39.848]  And 50% off on many other products on the site as well, and the store-wide free shipping.
[03:43:39.888 --> 03:43:49.091]  And what's even more exciting about this is, as I told you over a year ago, we can no longer get the deep earth crystals to produce the X2 formula.
[03:43:50.071 --> 03:43:56.675]  We were able to get another form of crystals that were just as good, but it still isn't the exact same formula because it's not the exact same type.
[03:43:57.476 --> 03:43:58.296]  That's X3.
[03:43:58.657 --> 03:44:00.298]  All three different types, tri-ionine.
[03:44:00.358 --> 03:44:00.858]  It's excellent.
[03:44:01.018 --> 03:44:01.478]  We have that.
[03:44:01.518 --> 03:44:02.039]  People love it.
[03:44:02.619 --> 03:44:11.785]  But I was able to get the exact same system, the exact same crystals, the exact same formula from the original manufacturer of our iodine.
[03:44:12.005 --> 03:44:15.127]  And we now have the purest, cleanest halogen out there.
[03:44:15.347 --> 03:44:19.510]  The good halogen versus the bad halogens of chloride and chlorine and all the rest of them.
[03:44:20.151 --> 03:44:40.421]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com now has store-wide free shipping and 50% off RainForce Plus, 50% off Survival Shield X2, 50% off Super Metal Vitality, 50% off Bodies, 50% off Alpha Power, 50% off Super Blue Products, 50% off DNA Force, 50% off Knockout.
[03:44:41.661 --> 03:44:52.991]  50% off Vitamin Monroe Fusion, and then again, all the other products are between 40% and 25% off, because some of the products don't have 40% or 50% you can cut off, because then you're actually losing money.

[03:45:02.980 --> 03:45:08.572]  And then, oh, I almost forgot, double Patriot points at InfoWarsTore.com as well.
[03:45:08.592 --> 03:45:13.342]  So instead of five cents on every dollar that goes towards your next purchase in your profile account,
[03:45:14.478 --> 03:45:15.819]  It's 10 cents on every dollar.
[03:45:16.139 --> 03:45:24.523]  So you add that to store-wide free shipping, you add that to 50% off, you add that to 10% off on auto ship, and then 10% off credit towards your next order.
[03:45:24.703 --> 03:45:25.703]  That's just insane.
[03:45:25.783 --> 03:45:29.185]  So this is the biggest sale we've ever done.
[03:45:29.265 --> 03:45:38.149]  It matches the sales we did year-end to clear out inventory in case the Globos were able to take away our final financial processing systems.
[03:45:38.809 --> 03:45:39.890]  But now we've got backups.
[03:45:40.190 --> 03:45:40.911]  Thanks to your prayers.

[03:47:35.387 --> 03:47:38.449]  Thank you to InfoWars, thank you to Alex Jones for inviting me on.
[03:47:38.989 --> 03:47:45.535]  So we've been talking about what a world without Alex Jones, what a world without conservatives on the internet, what that might look like.
[03:47:45.575 --> 03:47:45.875]  And again,
[03:47:46.175 --> 03:47:56.825]  As I said in the last segment, the number one way you can make sure that doesn't happen is call your representatives, make it clear to President Trump that he has to take action, but also support Alex Jones.
[03:47:57.165 --> 03:47:58.727]  Support the InfoWar.
[03:47:58.807 --> 03:48:00.028]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:48:00.048 --> 03:48:05.193]  But I want to continue talking about Fox News' newest darling.
[03:48:05.713 --> 03:48:09.277]  They've thrown Judge Jeanine to the wolves.
[03:48:09.795 --> 03:48:23.209]  And now they've adopted Donna Brazile, a woman who was kicked off CNN after the WikiLeaks showed that she essentially colluded with the Hillary Clinton campaign and gave her the debate questions unethically as she could possibly be.
[03:48:25.271 --> 03:48:30.316]  The one called Jake Tapper, I mean, sorry, not Jake Tapper, Stelzer, Brian Stelzer, over at CNN.
[03:48:30.396 --> 03:48:32.658]  Tucker affectionately refers to him as the eunuch.
[03:48:33.038 --> 03:48:40.104]  Alex Jones correctly points out that he could be a brother, cousin, perhaps even identical twin to the subway guy, Jared Fogle.
[03:48:40.625 --> 03:48:42.026]  Ooh, they're putting him on screen right now.
[03:48:42.086 --> 03:48:43.828]  What is with that face?
[03:48:44.088 --> 03:48:46.050]  I know I have nothing to brag about, but my God.
[03:48:48.112 --> 03:48:49.313]  He correctly pointed out
[03:48:50.462 --> 03:48:56.885]  That his network severed ties with Donna Brazile when her unethical behavior became known.
[03:48:57.545 --> 03:49:00.306]  Meanwhile, Fox News hires Donna Brazile!
[03:49:01.287 --> 03:49:09.651]  So then, Donna Brazile appears on Sean Hannity's podcast a couple days, or Sean, I wish, yeah, if he had a podcast it might be a lot better, on his TV show a couple days ago.
[03:49:10.851 --> 03:49:14.913]  And it was one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen on that network.
[03:49:14.933 --> 03:49:19.735]  Sean Hannity spent approximately the first three or four minutes of the segment just
[03:49:20.256 --> 03:49:23.338]  Kissing up to her and ingratiating himself to her.
[03:49:23.718 --> 03:49:29.562]  One must wonder exactly how much power does this crooked witch have at Fox News?
[03:49:29.922 --> 03:49:31.223]  This is the type of things he said.
[03:49:31.423 --> 03:49:33.104]  He said, I've known you for years.
[03:49:33.404 --> 03:49:36.767]  We have a very friendly, I would say cordial relationship.
[03:49:37.107 --> 03:49:38.548]  We've met at a lot of debates.
[03:49:38.788 --> 03:49:40.189]  We've met at a lot of conventions.
[03:49:40.229 --> 03:49:41.870]  We always have a good time.
[03:49:42.370 --> 03:49:50.816]  And I must ask, Sean Hannity, one of these debates you met at, would that be the debate when Donna Brazile gave Hillary Clinton the questions?
[03:49:51.576 --> 03:49:53.638]  This is something that puzzles me to no end.
[03:49:53.838 --> 03:49:59.141]  Hannity hammers and hammers and hammers because this is such a terrible thing.
[03:49:59.481 --> 03:50:02.283]  CNN gave the debate questions to Crooked Hillary.
[03:50:02.503 --> 03:50:03.364]  How could they do that?
[03:50:03.404 --> 03:50:04.405]  That's so unethical.
[03:50:04.945 --> 03:50:07.847]  But it wasn't just CNN, it was Donna Brazile.
[03:50:07.987 --> 03:50:10.989]  And this is what, again, Brian Stelzer, this is what he pointed out on Twitter.
[03:50:11.937 --> 03:50:13.878]  It wasn't Ryan Stelter who did that.
[03:50:14.218 --> 03:50:15.679]  It was Donna Brazile who did that.
[03:50:15.959 --> 03:50:18.000]  And the network fired Donna Brazile.
[03:50:18.280 --> 03:50:25.624]  Now Donna Brazile goes on Hannity's show and everything is happy happy and hugs and good times and we're all friends now.
[03:50:25.704 --> 03:50:26.704]  Isn't that wonderful?
[03:50:27.064 --> 03:50:28.885]  Isn't that progressive?
[03:50:29.926 --> 03:50:31.647]  Which is exactly what Hannity said.
[03:50:31.967 --> 03:50:34.008]  He said, well, welcome to the Fox News Channel.
[03:50:34.268 --> 03:50:38.210]  And for those who say we don't have varying opinions, I could go down the list.
[03:50:38.570 --> 03:50:40.651]  And if I do, I'll probably get in trouble.
[03:50:42.000 --> 03:50:46.003]  Pointing out that the network is host to how many anti-Trump people?
[03:50:46.023 --> 03:50:50.987]  We talked about Shepard Smith, who actually seems to loathe Sean Hannity.
[03:50:51.527 --> 03:50:54.029]  He said, I would never do an opinion show like that.
[03:50:54.109 --> 03:50:55.791]  I would never do what Sean Hannity does.
[03:50:55.851 --> 03:50:57.872]  I would quit my job if they asked me to do that.
[03:50:58.153 --> 03:51:01.435]  Well, that's all Shepard does, except he might as well be on MSNBC.
[03:51:01.735 --> 03:51:03.076]  He's one of those type of people.
[03:51:03.116 --> 03:51:03.777]  He's a leftist.
[03:51:03.997 --> 03:51:05.858]  He can call himself a Republican if he wants.
[03:51:06.099 --> 03:51:07.800]  Maybe he's a Mitt Romney Republican.
[03:51:08.501 --> 03:51:08.861]  Could be.
[03:51:10.598 --> 03:51:14.744]  But now, Donna Brazile, this opens an entirely new facet.
[03:51:15.105 --> 03:51:18.890]  And I know that it's kind of a third rail subject, so I'm not going to speculate.
[03:51:18.930 --> 03:51:20.072]  I'm just going to stick to the facts.
[03:51:20.112 --> 03:51:23.657]  But Donna Brazile, big league politics has it on good authority.
[03:51:23.717 --> 03:51:25.500]  She is a person of interest.
[03:51:26.181 --> 03:51:30.603]  In the murder investigation regarding DNC staffer Seth Rich.
[03:51:31.163 --> 03:51:39.025]  Now a lot of people online and in print and everywhere believe that Seth Rich may have been the source of the leaked emails.
[03:51:39.466 --> 03:51:40.546]  It wasn't a Russian.
[03:51:41.006 --> 03:51:42.407]  It wasn't Vladimir Putin.
[03:51:42.767 --> 03:51:44.447]  It wasn't the ghost of Stalin.
[03:51:44.947 --> 03:51:48.809]  It may have been this kid who was murdered at four in the morning.
[03:51:49.289 --> 03:51:49.649]  Shot.
[03:51:50.509 --> 03:51:51.890]  Nothing was taken from his person.
[03:51:52.310 --> 03:51:53.130]  He wasn't robbed.
[03:51:53.490 --> 03:51:55.611]  All of his valuables were left on him.
[03:51:56.471 --> 03:51:59.112]  And so this is an article we have up at Big League Politics.
[03:51:59.172 --> 03:52:04.355]  Fox News' Donna Brazile is person of interest in Seth Rich murder case, according to Investigator.
[03:52:04.375 --> 03:52:06.255]  And I don't even want to get too into the weeds.
[03:52:06.595 --> 03:52:18.841]  I just want to point out that in 2016 and 17, Fox News was actually willing to talk about this mysterious unsolved murder, where the police have just essentially laid it all to bed and said,
[03:52:19.775 --> 03:52:21.656]  Guess we figured out everything we can figure out.
[03:52:22.276 --> 03:52:23.076]  Sorry, family.
[03:52:23.276 --> 03:52:24.937]  Sorry, nation of curious people.
[03:52:24.957 --> 03:52:27.178]  Eh, our investigation is over.
[03:52:29.839 --> 03:52:33.060]  And now, Fox News, of course, they published articles about it.
[03:52:33.681 --> 03:52:34.821]  And they had to retract them.
[03:52:35.561 --> 03:52:37.362]  Because legal teams came after them.
[03:52:37.422 --> 03:52:39.143]  How dare you talk about Seth Ridge?
[03:52:39.163 --> 03:52:42.504]  How dare you discuss what a lot of people think may have been the case?
[03:52:43.004 --> 03:52:44.345]  They must be taken down.
[03:52:45.299 --> 03:52:46.960]  That was in 2017, I believe.
[03:52:47.381 --> 03:52:57.749]  And now here we are, a short two years later, and they've hired a woman who says in her book that she dedicated it to Seth Rich.
[03:52:58.109 --> 03:53:01.071]  She dedicated her book to Seth Rich.
[03:53:01.111 --> 03:53:04.094]  Why does nobody else think this is strange but me?
[03:53:04.874 --> 03:53:12.100]  She also, at one point, asked Hillary Clinton if she would be willing to donate to a fund to find the
[03:53:13.260 --> 03:53:13.982]  We're good.
[03:53:27.890 --> 03:53:32.734]  And so this is a couple excerpts from Brazil's article from the Big League Politics article.
[03:53:33.014 --> 03:53:48.446]  In Donna Brazile's new book, which again is dedicated to Seth Rich, she alleges that when she asked Hillary Clinton to contribute to a reward fund to find his murderer, the former first lady and failed presidential candidate abruptly ended the phone call.
[03:53:48.966 --> 03:53:49.607]  She said this.
[03:53:49.787 --> 03:53:51.568]  Her new book is called Hacks, by the way.
[03:53:51.608 --> 03:53:53.309]  I guess she would know what it's like to be a hack.
[03:53:53.669 --> 03:53:58.492]  She said, I knew the campaign had over $3 million set aside in a legal fund.
[03:53:58.812 --> 03:54:01.134]  Could she help me get this lawsuit started?
[03:54:01.494 --> 03:54:03.795]  And don't forget the murder of Seth Rich, I told her.
[03:54:04.075 --> 03:54:06.937]  Did she want to contribute to Seth's reward fund?
[03:54:07.197 --> 03:54:13.101]  We still hadn't found the person responsible for the tragic murder of this bright, young DNC staffer.
[03:54:13.661 --> 03:54:16.823]  According to Brazil, you're right, is what Hillary Clinton said.
[03:54:17.003 --> 03:54:18.244]  We're going to get to that.
[03:54:18.860 --> 03:54:20.921]  But then she really had to go.
[03:54:21.021 --> 03:54:23.002]  She had made the call and checked it off her list.
[03:54:23.342 --> 03:54:29.585]  And Donna Brazile says, I accepted after we said our goodbyes that I might never hear from her again.
[03:54:30.725 --> 03:54:32.766]  So the article of Big League Politics continues.
[03:54:33.146 --> 03:54:39.629]  The Democrat Party has been doing their best to gaslight anyone who has questions about Seth Rich's mysterious death.
[03:54:39.969 --> 03:54:44.831]  Yet in Brazile's book, she explains her own fears after his death and claims that it still haunts her.
[03:54:45.524 --> 03:54:52.468]  Oddly, Brazil, who claims in her book that her theories about why he was killed are either that he was murdered for being white, or by the Russians!
[03:54:53.869 --> 03:54:55.670]  He was killed by the Russians.
[03:54:55.751 --> 03:54:59.153]  Russian agents supporting President Trump killed a DNC staffer, apparently.
[03:54:59.233 --> 03:54:59.453]  Okay.
[03:55:00.083 --> 03:55:00.904]  Brazil wrote this,
[03:55:16.656 --> 03:55:22.781]  Besides that, racial tensions were high that summer, and I worry that he was murdered for being white on the wrong side of town.
[03:55:23.262 --> 03:55:26.004]  My friend Elaine expressed doubts about that, and I heard her.
[03:55:26.324 --> 03:55:30.368]  The FBI said they did not see any Russian fingerprints there.
[03:55:31.769 --> 03:55:34.832]  This is so fanciful, so insane to me.
[03:55:35.532 --> 03:55:41.037]  Fox News has now hired a woman who is a conspiracy theorist.
[03:55:41.610 --> 03:55:47.034]  And I don't mean like an Alex Jones conspiracy theorist where every single thing he says is backed up by facts.
[03:55:47.294 --> 03:55:54.540]  You can Google every word that comes out of the man's mouth and your jaw will just go lower and lower and lower as you realize he's right about almost every single thing in the world.
[03:55:56.021 --> 03:55:57.202]  This is a conspiracy!
[03:55:58.082 --> 03:56:11.012]  The Russians, which stole the election for President Trump through ways that we will never understand because we're just not smart enough, I guess, and Mueller's report is going to continue until everybody watching this broadcast is probably dead and in the ground.
[03:56:12.523 --> 03:56:22.585]  But the Russians hacked the election, they killed Seth Rich, they control the President, and they gave John McCain a dossier that says President Trump likes gold showers.
[03:56:24.106 --> 03:56:27.146]  None of this rings alarm bells to anybody at Fox News.
[03:56:27.507 --> 03:56:33.568]  None of this rings alarm bells that they're bringing on a literal conspiracy theorist to be one of their paid talking heads.
[03:56:34.850 --> 03:56:36.751]  This is the future without InfoWars.
[03:56:36.811 --> 03:56:38.511]  This is the best people we've got.
[03:56:38.771 --> 03:56:44.013]  You've got one or maybe two or maybe three hours on Fox News that are worth watching a day.
[03:56:44.454 --> 03:56:47.875]  You have an alleged sexual predator hosting one of the shows.
[03:56:48.275 --> 03:57:01.580]  You have Donna Brazile popping on throughout the day to give whatever harebrained, crazy, wackadoodle ideas she has coming to her head, like Seth Rich was killed by the Russians, when literally every arm of law enforcement says that's not the case.
[03:57:02.719 --> 03:57:09.382]  You have Judge Jeanine Pirro getting yanked off the air for having the audacity to say, hey, maybe Sharia law isn't compatible with the United States.
[03:57:09.722 --> 03:57:11.383]  Oh no, that's Islamophobic!
[03:57:11.643 --> 03:57:21.127]  Meanwhile, the network is essentially letting Ilhan Omar, because of their little Islamophobic mix-up, Ilhan Omar now gets by with whatever she wants.
[03:57:21.247 --> 03:57:28.190]  In fact, Omar, the radical anti-Semite, actually thanked Fox News for censuring Judge Jeanine.
[03:57:29.415 --> 03:57:31.356]  It's truly not the network it was six months ago.
[03:57:31.376 --> 03:57:32.797]  It's not the network it was a year ago.
[03:57:33.057 --> 03:57:35.538]  There's a lot of speculation that they're trying to sell it.
[03:57:36.238 --> 03:57:37.979]  They don't want to have to worry about it anymore.
[03:57:38.019 --> 03:57:40.800]  It's too big for one company to have, Foxcorp.
[03:57:41.821 --> 03:57:43.061]  And maybe that's the idea.
[03:57:43.361 --> 03:57:47.523]  Water it down, bring on hack CNN losers, and sell the dang thing.
[03:57:47.903 --> 03:57:49.324]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:49.404 --> 03:57:50.284]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[03:57:50.444 --> 03:57:50.985]  Stay tuned.
[03:57:51.005 --> 03:57:51.745]  We'll be right back.
[03:57:58.058 --> 03:58:03.403]  This is the Save the First Amendment, Stop Big Tech, Stop the Bias 50-hour broadcast.
[03:58:03.423 --> 03:58:06.245]  We've got everybody from Laura Loomer to Tommy Robinson joining us.
[03:58:06.406 --> 03:58:10.109]  I believe Joe said he could do it, but Joe is famously busy, okay?
[03:58:10.149 --> 03:58:11.270]  But regardless, I'm gonna interview with him.
[03:58:11.350 --> 03:58:12.031]  He's coming to town.
[03:58:12.111 --> 03:58:13.592]  And there's a bunch of other surprise guests.
[03:58:13.712 --> 03:58:14.713]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[03:58:14.833 --> 03:58:21.279]  From now, right through Saturday morning, 10 a.m., focal point on free speech and a focal point on what we're fighting and what the stakes are.

[03:58:46.388 --> 03:58:53.273]  And you fund an operation where we get up here and fight the pedophiles and fight people openly saying we're gonna kill babies after they're born and sell their goodies.
[03:58:53.293 --> 03:58:54.974]  Because they want their goodies.
[03:58:55.975 --> 03:58:59.118]  Hell, I mean the pedophiles, I guess, just rape the kids.
[03:58:59.138 --> 03:58:59.638]  These folks want
