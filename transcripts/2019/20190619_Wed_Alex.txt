[00:00:12.892 --> 00:00:16.956]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:16.956 --> 00:00:21.981]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:25.324]  2016 was not merely another four year election.
[00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:30.669]  This was a defining moment in American history.
[00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.311]  Ask them right there.
[00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.240]  By the way, that is a lot of fake news back there.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.641]  That's a lot.
[00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:12.001]  That's a lot.
[00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:12.642]  You know what I say?
[00:01:33.294 --> 00:01:46.820]  The amount of press we have tonight reminds me of the Academy Awards before it went political and their ratings went down the tubes.
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:56.184]  I stand before you to officially launch my campaign for a second term as President of the United States.
[00:01:56.184 --> 00:02:01.787]  Very historic, because exactly four years ago this week I announced
[00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:09.385]  My campaign for President of the United States.
[00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:13.406]  And it turned out to be more than just a political campaign.
[00:02:13.406 --> 00:02:18.628]  It turned out to be a great political movement because of you.
[00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:22.730]  A great movement.
[00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.171]  2016 was not merely another four-year election.
[00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:31.380]  This was a defining moment in American history.
[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.567]  Ask them right there.
[00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:44.251]  By the way, that is a lot of fake news back there.
[00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:45.933]  That's a lot.
[00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:46.373]  That's a lot.
[00:02:48.717 --> 00:02:54.021]  We took on a political machine that tried to take away your voice and your vote.
[00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:59.746]  They tried to take away your dignity and your destiny.
[00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:07.653]  But we will never let them do that, will we?
[00:03:07.653 --> 00:03:13.818]  Many times I said we would drain the swamp, and that's exactly what we're doing right now.
[00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:15.019]  We're draining the swamp.
[00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:42.173]  And that's why the swamp is fighting back so viciously and violently.
[00:03:42.173 --> 00:03:48.576]  For the last two and a half years, we have been under siege.
[00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:51.697]  And with the Mueller report, we won.
[00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:53.818]  And now they want a do-over.
[00:03:53.818 --> 00:03:54.938]  They want a do-over.
[00:03:54.938 --> 00:03:55.899]  Let's do it again.
[00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:57.439]  Didn't work out too well.
[00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.820]  Let's do it again.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:00.841]  They want a do-over.
[00:04:02.705 --> 00:04:06.288]  No president should ever have to go through this again.
[00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:11.713]  It is so bad for our great country.
[00:04:11.713 --> 00:04:12.914]  A hoax.
[00:04:12.914 --> 00:04:18.679]  Our radical Democrat opponents are driven by hatred, prejudice, and rage.
[00:04:18.679 --> 00:04:25.005]  They want to destroy you, and they want to destroy our country as we know it.
[00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:26.486]  Not acceptable.
[00:04:26.486 --> 00:04:27.767]  It's not going to happen.
[00:04:27.827 --> 00:04:33.152]  The only thing these corrupt politicians will understand is an earthquake at the ballot box.
[00:04:33.152 --> 00:04:34.674]  That's what they will understand.
[00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:38.718]  And they're going to see it.
[00:04:38.718 --> 00:04:45.144]  For the last two and a half years, we have been under siege.
[00:04:45.144 --> 00:04:47.026]  And with the Mueller report, we won.
[00:04:48.117 --> 00:04:54.460]  Alright, there's more of these amazing compilations coming up on this Wednesday, June 19th.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.120]  2019 Global Transmission.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.862]  We are under siege, but we're winning.
[00:05:00.862 --> 00:05:04.524]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:05:04.997 --> 00:05:15.384]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[00:05:15.384 --> 00:05:20.208]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[00:05:20.208 --> 00:05:34.698]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little-d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting InfoWars.
[00:05:34.818 --> 00:05:43.984]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[00:05:43.984 --> 00:05:52.590]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.912]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment.
[00:05:55.912 --> 00:05:59.294]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:11.316]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today as we broadcast worldwide.
[00:06:29.548 --> 00:06:40.435]  You know, I've done a lot of reflection on why the globalists hate this show so much, and why they hate this broadcast so much, and why they go to lengths never before seen to try to take us off the air.
[00:06:40.435 --> 00:06:55.645]  And it's because we're covering the technocracy, the global cashless society, the global cryptocurrency, the worldwide Chinese social score, also known 2,000 years ago in the Book of Revelations.
[00:06:58.223 --> 00:07:04.929]  They hate it because we know their plan and we are alerting our fellow humans to this demonic operation.
[00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:08.512]  This off-world operation that the Holy Bible warns us about.
[00:07:08.512 --> 00:07:09.612]  Yes, we're on a planet.
[00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:11.734]  Yes, the enemy is not of this world.
[00:07:11.734 --> 00:07:18.820]  Yes, everything's being set up to basically kill us but slowly so we never figure out what hit us.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:26.867]  And I prayed a lot last night and this morning I got up and hung out with my wife and my two-year-old daughter and then I
[00:07:28.735 --> 00:07:34.998]  Went out and got on the elliptical for about an hour and I was just thinking about the world and what the most important issues are.
[00:07:34.998 --> 00:07:51.226]  And it's subjects we've covered before, but at the start of the next hour, I'm going to spend three segments or so really delving into the number one threat of this whole system and a do or die point that we have reached.
[00:07:51.226 --> 00:07:54.208]  So that's going to be coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:07:56.471 --> 00:07:59.334]  Trump knocked it out of the park.
[00:07:59.334 --> 00:08:06.881]  He's gotten way better and he was super powerful and informative when he first launched operations against the globalists four years ago.
[00:08:07.836 --> 00:08:08.056]  I don't
[00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:33.206]  He's trying to be the president.
[00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.371]  And he really cares about humanity.
[00:08:55.371 --> 00:08:58.631]  And he's not out to get the American people or to screw us over.
[00:08:58.631 --> 00:09:07.534]  He doesn't have a systemic hatred of the nation like globalists have instilled in the left in this country.
[00:09:07.534 --> 00:09:13.375]  That said, though, Trump is 73 now.
[00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:16.756]  And he comes from a very conservative family.
[00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:19.797]  And by that, very old-fashioned, his father and mother.
[00:09:19.797 --> 00:09:20.817]  And Trump's a dinosaur.
[00:09:21.977 --> 00:09:24.045]  Now that's a good thing.
[00:09:24.045 --> 00:09:26.273]  It's good to have a throwback.
[00:09:27.406 --> 00:09:31.808]  Because, you know, the old-fashioned system he follows is the vanguard of Western culture.
[00:09:31.808 --> 00:09:37.971]  The system we have now is a corrupt, collapsing, leftist system, a cancer from within.
[00:09:37.971 --> 00:09:40.872]  So what is old is really new.
[00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:48.056]  Our republic, our system, our Magna Carta, our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, our Declaration of Independence, it is the Renaissance.
[00:09:48.056 --> 00:09:50.077]  It's the best system.
[00:09:50.077 --> 00:09:52.418]  So he called Trump a throwback for liking that.
[00:09:53.322 --> 00:09:55.904]  Well, it just doesn't really hold water.
[00:09:55.904 --> 00:10:03.268]  But when it comes to loving fast food and loving burnt steaks and ketchup, he's really very blue-collar.
[00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:04.769]  That's not a bad thing.
[00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:08.551]  But he's got big, fat blind spots for things like 5G.
[00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:13.754]  And he knows damn well Barron almost got mentally retarded from vaccines.
[00:10:13.754 --> 00:10:15.195]  I've talked to folks that know the President.
[00:10:15.195 --> 00:10:17.296]  I never had the nerve to ask him myself.
[00:10:17.296 --> 00:10:18.577]  Barron came back from most of it.
[00:10:20.646 --> 00:10:27.011]  But we need to now talk about what we're demanding of Trump.
[00:10:27.011 --> 00:10:29.833]  Because Trump's going to win re-election on the current course.
[00:10:29.833 --> 00:10:32.014]  He's doing the right things.
[00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:38.479]  He's about to deport a bunch of illegal aliens so the others watching around the world know to not come here to quote, get their free ride.
[00:10:38.479 --> 00:10:44.743]  They're moving to change the immigration laws on people that claim that they are asylum seekers.
[00:10:44.743 --> 00:10:48.666]  It's all being abused by design to break the nation state.
[00:10:48.666 --> 00:10:50.027]  The UN, the globalists admit it.
[00:10:52.073 --> 00:11:01.463]  But the things that can sink Trump are things like forced inoculations, gun control, victim disarmament, getting into a war with Iran.
[00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:07.032]  The Federal Reserve raising interest rates again, which Trump's pressuring him to lower them.
[00:11:07.032 --> 00:11:07.933]  Absolutely.
[00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:14.756]  We had no interest rates, you know, when Obama was in and then they raised them, what, eight times when Trump got in?
[00:11:14.756 --> 00:11:23.700]  We need to cut some of those interest rates back because they want to implode the bubble that the globalists started before Trump gets a real recovery in place.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:30.224]  So that's in the news that is the Federal Reserve about to cave to Trump's demand to cut interest rates?
[00:11:30.224 --> 00:11:32.365]  Oh, no, that's just terrible.
[00:11:33.404 --> 00:11:37.607]  There's all these reports and there's CNN headlines.
[00:11:37.607 --> 00:11:40.589]  Can his recovery hold or how can we stop it?
[00:11:40.589 --> 00:11:51.837]  You've all seen Bill Maher bemoaning some recovery and hoping we can have a depression so we can teach Americans to hate themselves.
[00:11:51.837 --> 00:11:59.222]  So we've been taught to hate the nation, hate ourselves, taught that we're losers, taught to not expect a better life or a better world.
[00:11:59.222 --> 00:11:59.803]  It's not going to work.
[00:12:01.567 --> 00:12:02.567]  If we keep fighting.
[00:12:02.567 --> 00:12:05.268]  Meanwhile, AOC really writes the talking points now for the Democrats.
[00:12:05.268 --> 00:12:13.810]  She came out, as you know, two days ago and said that anyone being held at the border is basically in a death camp and that it's a concentration camp.
[00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:19.111]  Well, now top Democrats are coming out with official talking points on MSNBC and CNN.
[00:12:19.111 --> 00:12:26.932]  We're going to play those after the break, saying that it's all a giant concentration camp.
[00:12:26.932 --> 00:12:30.013]  Let me explain something to the leftists who I know know they're lying.
[00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.571]  How do you tell before their lips even move, you know?
[00:12:34.571 --> 00:12:36.711]  They're of their father, the devil.
[00:12:36.711 --> 00:12:40.612]  Figuratively and archetypally and in reality as well.
[00:12:40.612 --> 00:12:43.653]  You don't fight to get into a concentration camp.
[00:12:43.653 --> 00:12:46.973]  You don't fight to get into a country that's bad.
[00:12:46.973 --> 00:12:54.955]  These people are fleeing collapsing third world hell holes where total corruption has set in.
[00:12:54.955 --> 00:12:57.836]  And they're coming here by the millions a quarter.
[00:12:58.735 --> 00:13:07.360]  They've caught, on average, about a million a year, and now they're saying that number three times what it previously was, so it could be two or three million this year.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.063]  And many of them are the very worst type.
[00:13:11.063 --> 00:13:19.668]  Criminal records, mental illnesses, pre-existing conditions to weigh down the country.
[00:13:19.668 --> 00:13:22.550]  But you just think about the weaponized media
[00:13:24.241 --> 00:13:28.202]  And they're having congressional hearings right now about reparations for slavery.
[00:13:28.202 --> 00:13:38.525]  And there's more and more phenomenon where black people beat up white people and rape white women and say it's because of reparations because of the slavery we went through.
[00:13:38.525 --> 00:13:40.026]  This is total mind control.
[00:13:41.172 --> 00:13:46.658]  There are cases where women are raped in public because they're white.
[00:13:46.658 --> 00:13:47.939]  We'll be covering it later.
[00:13:47.939 --> 00:13:51.623]  And the people videotape it and think it's okay because they're white.
[00:13:51.623 --> 00:14:00.772]  So they deserve to have their teeth knocked out and their eyes busted open and their bodies raped because they're white.
[00:14:00.772 --> 00:14:01.412]  It's total...
[00:14:02.253 --> 00:14:04.894]  Leftist inflicted ideology.
[00:14:04.894 --> 00:14:09.236]  You turn on Netflix, a third of the shows are about black people being persecuted.
[00:14:09.236 --> 00:14:11.657]  It's not to help black people.
[00:14:11.657 --> 00:14:19.020]  It's to have the state further take over your countries, take over your nations, take over your families, and make you dependent.
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.141]  Man nabbed for Bronx rape.
[00:14:21.141 --> 00:14:23.542]  Allegedly said she deserved it for slavery.
[00:14:23.542 --> 00:14:28.124]  Well, he came with friends and shot videos of it.
[00:14:28.124 --> 00:14:29.225]  Imagine the
[00:14:32.091 --> 00:14:33.652]  Imagine the disconnect.
[00:14:33.652 --> 00:14:40.018]  She went up with him on the roof at the apartment complex at night.
[00:14:40.018 --> 00:14:45.382]  And instead of just having sex with her, he beat her half to death and raped her.
[00:14:45.382 --> 00:14:46.703]  Because she deserved it.
[00:14:46.703 --> 00:14:50.206]  Because she did something to him because she was white.
[00:14:50.206 --> 00:14:54.029]  That's beyond the KKK, beyond the Nazis.
[00:14:54.029 --> 00:14:57.372]  It's just total mindless idiocy.
[00:14:58.246 --> 00:15:00.107]  It's the West that ended slavery.
[00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:06.088]  It's the West that went in and taught people in Africa to stop eating themselves.
[00:15:06.088 --> 00:15:09.549]  Because we were doing it too, a thousand years before.
[00:15:09.549 --> 00:15:11.990]  But Christianity changed that.
[00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.391]  And then due process and rule of law changed all that.
[00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:18.932]  And in the fourth hour today I'm going to be hosting, I'm going to get into the rule of law.
[00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:28.015]  And why it's so important, why the West is committing suicide and may be too far gone, but we can still have pockets of the West.
[00:15:28.015 --> 00:15:31.777]  And the West is ideas and culture, not color.
[00:15:31.777 --> 00:15:41.223]  But if you don't celebrate it and admit its superiority, you will be destroyed by the systems that are inferior.
[00:15:41.223 --> 00:15:45.906]  We all must recognize systems that are superior or be destroyed.
[00:15:45.906 --> 00:15:49.148]  When we come back, ladies and gentlemen, aha!
[00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:49.248]  Aha!
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:58.126]  Millions pouring across, you stop any of them, give them medical treatment, put them in a jail cell because they're convicted criminal, you are a concentration camp guard.
[00:15:58.126 --> 00:16:00.828]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.828 --> 00:16:04.751]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:04.751 --> 00:16:06.292]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:06.292 --> 00:16:09.255]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:09.255 --> 00:16:14.439]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:40.398]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:16:40.558 --> 00:16:49.885]  Bill Hyde here, and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[00:16:49.885 --> 00:16:55.169]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[00:16:55.169 --> 00:17:07.358]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[00:17:07.358 --> 00:17:08.619]  So here's what you should do right now.
[00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.520]  Check out the PPX microgrid system.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.361]  Thank you.
[00:17:28.763 --> 00:17:31.405]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.

[00:18:03.896 --> 00:18:05.657]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.657 --> 00:18:17.725]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.725 --> 00:18:22.729]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:18:23.489 --> 00:18:32.658]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.658 --> 00:18:37.423]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:40.566 --> 00:18:42.267]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.267 --> 00:18:52.276]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.276 --> 00:18:54.938]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.938 --> 00:18:59.642]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:03.636]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget, this is the maximum alert.

[00:19:14.898 --> 00:19:16.138]  box if you want to mail us a check.
[00:19:16.138 --> 00:19:17.939]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:22.239]  We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.
[00:19:22.239 --> 00:19:25.140]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main page.
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.540]  We have a huge sale going.
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.660]  Save InfoWars.
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.601]  Super special.
[00:19:28.601 --> 00:19:29.501]  Emergency special.
[00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:29.581]  50% off.
[00:19:30.501 --> 00:19:35.565]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[00:19:35.565 --> 00:19:36.985]  We're not going to back down.
[00:20:03.397 --> 00:20:06.059]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:47.338 --> 00:21:10.998]  Let me do this because I did a lot of preparation for this broadcast and sometimes it's those shows that are, I don't want to say bad broadcast, but they're not as informative as they could be because I tend to do so much preparation and so much research that then to try to even get into every quadrant of the news
[00:21:12.148 --> 00:21:14.310]  Becomes an impossibility.
[00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:18.473]  But let me just tell you what's in front of me right now, and then what's coming up today.
[00:21:18.473 --> 00:21:22.296]  Just to give you a little taste of things.
[00:21:22.296 --> 00:21:23.617]  And how crazy things are.
[00:21:23.617 --> 00:21:38.970]  And then if people just break out of their trance, and aren't helpless, and break out of the Stockholm Syndrome, that so many people have been put into, we could game over this globalist system today.
[00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.392]  It could fall like the Berlin Wall today.
[00:21:43.339 --> 00:21:45.160]  Corporate media is already totally discredited.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.361]  It's already totally bankrupt.
[00:21:46.361 --> 00:21:53.387]  It's been completely propped up by the globalists and big central banks and others that make money out of thin air.
[00:21:53.387 --> 00:21:56.549]  But their ideology, their world system is dead on arrival.
[00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:59.291]  But they're still just going ahead with it.
[00:21:59.291 --> 00:22:02.734]  So let me just give you an example.
[00:22:02.734 --> 00:22:09.319]  I'm so punch drunk to knowing that the Clintons run pedophilia and are pedophiles.
[00:22:11.698 --> 00:22:22.965]  That it came out two days ago on NBC News National that indeed they protected a pedophile ring at the State Department that they use to control people.
[00:22:22.965 --> 00:22:27.969]  That's the headline, NBC News, Hillary Clinton covered up pedophile ring at State Department.
[00:22:27.969 --> 00:22:29.690]  Now folks, I saw that two days ago.
[00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:33.712]  I saw the newscast admitting it.
[00:22:33.712 --> 00:22:34.313]  Do you realize
[00:22:35.967 --> 00:22:43.735]  That yes, this just came back out this week, this was reported on years ago, and no one even got in trouble.
[00:22:43.735 --> 00:22:49.221]  You know, is that the reason Matt Lauer was fired?
[00:22:49.221 --> 00:22:54.206]  But the point is, it's back in the news now.
[00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:58.330]  Now I have a whole stack, about three inches tall,
[00:23:01.735 --> 00:23:18.944]  Did you know the woman that she uses to go around and pick up kids and transfer them around the country and the world, got convicted of child kidnapping for sex trafficking, and then changed her name and somehow runs Amber Alerts today?
[00:23:18.944 --> 00:23:21.806]  And when you go look that up, it'll completely blow you away.
[00:23:21.806 --> 00:23:26.689]  Or the group that runs Amber Alerts.
[00:23:26.689 --> 00:23:29.090]  Yeah.
[00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.591]  Gotta know where the packages are going.
[00:23:32.964 --> 00:23:35.365]  Now that's just one stack, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:35.365 --> 00:23:48.651]  And then you wonder, Dr. McCam's shot, please for TV viewers, how they would put out headlines the last two days, like this one.
[00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:50.952]  This is Associated Press.
[00:23:50.952 --> 00:23:52.493]  This isn't about me.
[00:23:52.493 --> 00:23:54.034]  This is about testing fake news.
[00:23:56.363 --> 00:24:08.333]  Robert Barnes, respected litigant, respected lawyer, a guy that sues a lot of people and wins, called AP four times in the last two days.
[00:24:08.333 --> 00:24:10.715]  And talked to senior people he knows.
[00:24:10.715 --> 00:24:14.698]  And they said, Mr. Barnes, we've called, we can't get it changed.
[00:24:14.698 --> 00:24:15.639]  We've called management.
[00:24:16.769 --> 00:24:28.875]  They put out a headline, 100% false, and they know it's false, and they made it the front of Yahoo and the top of Twitter almost all day yesterday.
[00:24:28.875 --> 00:24:31.956]  Everyone I know saw it, basically.
[00:24:31.956 --> 00:24:36.658]  And people were like, well, were you convicted?
[00:24:36.658 --> 00:24:38.159]  Or did you do all this?
[00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:41.321]  Or did you just get found guilty civilly?
[00:24:41.321 --> 00:24:42.321]  And I'm like, no!
[00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:43.602]  Look at the headline of your radio listener.
[00:24:44.895 --> 00:24:48.959]  This is Associated Press published in hundreds of publications across the world.
[00:24:48.959 --> 00:24:51.641]  Wall Street Journal published it as well.
[00:24:51.641 --> 00:24:57.387]  Father of Sandy Hook victim wins defamation suit against Alex Jones.
[00:24:57.387 --> 00:25:06.175]  Alex Jones is the host of the conspiracy-driven InfoWars website and wrote a book titled Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.
[00:25:06.175 --> 00:25:06.956]  Now ladies and gentlemen,
[00:25:08.294 --> 00:25:10.175]  I've never read that book.
[00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:12.595]  I have nothing to do with it.
[00:25:12.595 --> 00:25:19.658]  I interviewed one of the authors, last time was probably 12 years ago, Professor Fetzer, about 9-11.
[00:25:19.658 --> 00:25:21.138]  Other than that, I have no connection.
[00:25:21.138 --> 00:25:22.319]  I've never read the book.
[00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:24.039]  I don't own the book.
[00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:25.680]  I was not sued over the book.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.541]  You understand, they, AP said, it's staying up.
[00:25:32.244 --> 00:25:39.610]  Now remember, this weekend they said we're at war with Russia and that we knocked out their power grid and tried to bring down their nuclear reactors.
[00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.252]  An act of psychotic war.
[00:25:42.252 --> 00:25:44.974]  Trump came out and said that's absolutely BS!
[00:25:44.974 --> 00:25:45.815]  We didn't do that!
[00:25:47.523 --> 00:25:50.206]  He said, what the hell is wrong with the New York Times?
[00:25:50.206 --> 00:25:52.729]  Are you trying to start a nuclear war, you crazy people?
[00:25:52.729 --> 00:25:54.691]  And yes, they've gone crazy, folks.
[00:25:54.691 --> 00:25:56.993]  I don't know exactly what they're trying.
[00:25:56.993 --> 00:26:01.378]  But there's a whole stack of news here saying I sent child porn to the Sandy Hook families.
[00:26:01.378 --> 00:26:02.259]  Did no such thing.
[00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:06.072]  I was sent 9.6 million emails.
[00:26:06.072 --> 00:26:08.353]  They subpoenaed anything with Sandy Hook in the name.
[00:26:08.353 --> 00:26:09.934]  They got 57,000 emails.
[00:26:09.934 --> 00:26:24.680]  There was some hidden link in there that didn't even say child porn about Sandy Hook that they sent me and Death Threats, whoever it is, Death Threats to me had hidden child porn and the headline is Alex Jones is sending child porn around.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.281]  Now a lot of folks did retract.
[00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:30.623]  Alyssa Milano, the Young Turks, they said it wasn't true, they were wrong.
[00:26:32.705 --> 00:26:40.008]  But not the Wall Street Journal, not the New York Times, not the Associated Press.
[00:26:40.008 --> 00:26:45.490]  They say, now I want that to sink in, I want that to sink in real good.
[00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:55.353]  They made it the front story, the top of Yahoo for several hours, but the front page of Yahoo all day.
[00:26:55.353 --> 00:26:57.814]  And in AP, all over the country,
[00:26:59.798 --> 00:27:09.127]  That I wrote a book called Nobody Died at Sandy Hook that I've never read or touched, and that I lost a lawsuit.
[00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:20.098]  Ladies and gentlemen, I forgot to, it's somewhere in my stack, you guys type in, it's from like six years ago, Obama legalizes the use of domestic propaganda against the American people
[00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:24.155]  Public Affairs of the Washington Post.
[00:27:24.155 --> 00:27:29.419]  And they legalized the CIA putting out pure fake news, and it's gotten worse and worse.
[00:27:29.419 --> 00:27:39.286]  This is leftist in the CIA, they admit that's who's running it, the congressional hearings, and they are now saying that I've lost a lawsuit, that I wrote a book called Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.
[00:27:39.286 --> 00:27:40.887]  They know it's not true, they don't care.
[00:27:40.887 --> 00:27:43.268]  They know I didn't send child porn, they don't care.
[00:27:43.268 --> 00:27:46.410]  And I was asking one of the SMART crew members this morning, I said, what do you think's next?
[00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:47.891]  They said, more child porn.
[00:27:47.891 --> 00:27:49.452]  Yeah, they're just gonna go with that.
[00:27:51.485 --> 00:27:52.586]  It's okay.
[00:27:52.586 --> 00:27:54.868]  Because folks, I know why they're after us.
[00:27:54.868 --> 00:27:55.409]  I know why.
[00:27:55.409 --> 00:27:56.870]  I'm going to cover it at the start of the next hour.
[00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:58.932]  I know why they want us off air.
[00:27:58.932 --> 00:28:02.155]  I know the number one reason.
[00:28:02.155 --> 00:28:04.718]  And it's an honor to be here and an honor to go up against these folks.
[00:28:04.718 --> 00:28:07.660]  These people are criminal scum.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.821]  And guess what?
[00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:14.347]  It's all coming out in the new Nexum Cult trial.
[00:28:16.567 --> 00:28:22.895]  The devil worship, the torture, the human sacrifice, and of course Hillary involved.
[00:28:22.895 --> 00:28:26.580]  Mainstream news.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.606]  Trafficking children out of Mexico and Haiti that disappear.
[00:28:31.606 --> 00:28:33.829]  That disappear and sometimes are found.
[00:28:37.856 --> 00:28:38.717]  You think about that.
[00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:42.461]  They are so scared right now, and they want me to shut my mouth.
[00:28:42.461 --> 00:28:44.384]  Never shut my mouth.
[00:28:44.384 --> 00:28:49.830]  You go ahead and try to plant all the child porn you want on me, nobody's buying it.
[00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.693]  You pack of knuckle-dragging devil worshippers.
[00:28:52.693 --> 00:28:55.316]  You got that, you slimy pedos?
[00:28:55.316 --> 00:28:56.898]  America knows who you are, trash!
[00:28:59.622 --> 00:29:01.583]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.583 --> 00:29:06.904]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.904 --> 00:29:08.484]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.484 --> 00:29:16.846]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:16.846 --> 00:29:22.528]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:22.708 --> 00:29:24.529]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:26.790]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:31.192]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:31.192 --> 00:29:33.393]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:30:03.224 --> 00:30:05.045]  We're going into the season of war.
[00:30:05.045 --> 00:30:11.127]  And they have been inches from shutting down the final mega accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[00:30:11.127 --> 00:30:14.788]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[00:30:14.788 --> 00:30:15.709]  We need to end here.
[00:30:15.709 --> 00:30:17.029]  We need to be provisioned.
[00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:21.371]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:25.473]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[00:30:25.473 --> 00:30:27.394]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[00:30:27.394 --> 00:30:32.376]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[00:30:32.376 --> 00:30:35.678]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[00:30:35.678 --> 00:30:36.518]  I need gas.
[00:30:36.518 --> 00:30:38.039]  I need ammo politically now!
[00:30:38.439 --> 00:30:44.744]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[00:30:44.744 --> 00:30:45.865]  We're unstoppable together.
[00:30:45.865 --> 00:30:47.286]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[00:30:47.286 --> 00:30:54.312]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[00:30:54.312 --> 00:30:55.293]  You have my commitment.
[00:30:55.293 --> 00:30:59.637]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[00:31:02.446 --> 00:31:07.068]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[00:32:00.655 --> 00:32:07.304]  Infowars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so.
[00:32:07.304 --> 00:32:11.970]  It's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane.
[00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:15.735]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time
[00:32:16.596 --> 00:32:22.460]  Tap to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.562]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real SOS.
[00:32:26.562 --> 00:32:33.466]  If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, InfoWars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[00:32:33.466 --> 00:32:34.307]  And so we've reached that point.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.020]  It'll make the enemy happy, but, you know, whatever.
[00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.101]  We have withstood so many of their attacks.
[00:32:39.101 --> 00:32:41.681]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[00:32:41.681 --> 00:32:43.042]  You have been there.
[00:32:43.042 --> 00:32:47.843]  But let me tell you, they are pissed they haven't been successful, and they're giving us their full assault.
[00:32:47.843 --> 00:32:53.984]  So we need your prayers, your financial support, and your word of mouth now at InfoWarshow.com.
[00:32:53.984 --> 00:32:54.964]  It's your fight.
[00:32:54.964 --> 00:32:59.285]  Decide whether or not you want InfoWars to continue, because we could be shut down.
[00:33:03.317 --> 00:33:11.679]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:12.600]  Another world.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.340]  Another time.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:14.700]  In the age of wonder.
[00:33:44.637 --> 00:34:00.949]  Okay, I tried to get started last segment saying that I would just tell you the news in front of me and of course I went into the first stack and just went ahead and went into it.
[00:34:00.949 --> 00:34:04.892]  I've said this many times, it's like the old Tootsie Roll ads they had back in the 70s and 80s where
[00:34:06.531 --> 00:34:11.214]  The kid asked the wise Al how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.
[00:34:11.214 --> 00:34:17.138]  He goes, one, two, three, and three, because you can never, you know, keep yourself from biting into it.
[00:34:17.138 --> 00:34:18.819]  And it's the same thing.
[00:34:18.819 --> 00:34:22.362]  Let me just give you an example here of the news we've got.
[00:34:23.294 --> 00:34:29.461]  New York lawmakers legalize illegal aliens getting a driver's license and voting.
[00:34:29.461 --> 00:34:32.304]  And so have a bunch of other states and leftist cities.
[00:34:32.304 --> 00:34:33.646]  Just totally criminal.
[00:34:33.646 --> 00:34:35.067]  Oh, but illegal aliens don't vote.
[00:34:35.067 --> 00:34:36.649]  They just say they should be able to vote.
[00:34:36.649 --> 00:34:38.992]  And they do vote now in places like San Francisco.
[00:34:40.234 --> 00:34:40.454]  I'm
[00:34:58.497 --> 00:35:01.159]  Other key reports here dealing with the economy.
[00:35:01.159 --> 00:35:06.284]  Israel holds large military drills ahead of U.S.-Iran tensions and the U.S.
[00:35:06.284 --> 00:35:10.667]  is basically saying that they're getting ready, the people that run our government, to attack Iran.
[00:35:10.667 --> 00:35:13.510]  Very unwise, I think, at this point by the President.
[00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:22.897]  A lot of evidence points towards false flag, but regardless, this is the exact type of trap that they could use to try to bring us into a larger war.
[00:35:22.897 --> 00:35:25.399]  And Senator Rand Paul has said this will be worse than Iraq.
[00:35:25.399 --> 00:35:25.760]  I agree.
[00:35:27.403 --> 00:35:29.925]  By many, many magnitudes.
[00:35:29.925 --> 00:35:31.106]  Many, many magnitudes.
[00:35:31.106 --> 00:35:41.155]  And then I haven't gotten into the latest on Huawei and 5G and what's unfolding with that whole fight and why Trump is really shutting them down.
[00:35:41.155 --> 00:35:44.397]  It's not just about the fact they can spy on us with these.
[00:35:44.397 --> 00:35:47.200]  It's even bigger than that.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.761]  So wait till we get to that.
[00:35:48.761 --> 00:35:51.523]  But Owen Schroyer, who hosts The War Room 3 p.m.
[00:35:51.523 --> 00:35:51.924]  every day,
[00:35:52.464 --> 00:35:59.354]  It's here with us riding shotgun in the next part of this segment, the next, to announce something important.
[00:35:59.354 --> 00:36:03.479]  And I want to be very, very clear about all of this.
[00:36:03.479 --> 00:36:09.908]  In the fight against the globalists, diversification and having many legs to a stool is critical.
[00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:16.655]  You know they've been trying for years to shut down InfoWars and really going to incredible lengths to do it.
[00:36:16.655 --> 00:36:30.147]  The latest huge hoax stories that I've lost lawsuits, huge hoax stories that I'm sending child porn to people, just really dangerous stuff that signifies they're getting ready to try to physically remove Trump and all of his key supporters.
[00:36:30.147 --> 00:36:35.092]  They wouldn't be this reckless with the things they're currently doing if they weren't about to pull the trigger again.
[00:36:35.852 --> 00:36:38.855]  AP, it's still the top of Twitter.
[00:36:38.855 --> 00:36:41.157]  So we're talking 24 hours later.
[00:36:41.157 --> 00:36:43.399]  Please put it on screen for TV viewers.
[00:36:43.399 --> 00:36:52.887]  Twitter has the fake news story, Associated Press, father of Sandy Hook, victim of defamation lawsuit against Alex Jones.
[00:36:52.887 --> 00:36:58.451]  Alex Jones is the host of Conspiracy Driven Infowars website and wrote a book titled Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.
[00:36:58.451 --> 00:37:01.774]  Now, we've called AP, we've talked to senior people.
[00:37:01.774 --> 00:37:03.636]  They said it's standing.
[00:37:05.191 --> 00:37:06.551]  I am not the author of the book.
[00:37:06.551 --> 00:37:07.592]  I have never read the book.
[00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:08.812]  I have never touched the book.
[00:37:08.812 --> 00:37:10.813]  I want to explain something.
[00:37:10.813 --> 00:37:18.095]  The fact that they're doing this shows that they're signaling to the rest of the media, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times have also done this.
[00:37:18.095 --> 00:37:25.478]  That they're telling the young Turks and all the siblings that retracted all this that I wasn't sending child porn because they know we're going to sue them.
[00:37:25.478 --> 00:37:29.719]  They're saying, no, we're going to teach you how to lie properly.
[00:37:29.719 --> 00:37:31.800]  We're going to teach you how to be deceptive.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.021]  Here is foreignpolicy.com.
[00:37:34.534 --> 00:37:38.256]  Part of the Council on Foreign Relations through the Washington Post.
[00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:38.976]  Here they are, 2013.
[00:37:38.976 --> 00:37:43.879]  U.S.
[00:37:43.879 --> 00:37:48.201]  repeals propaganda ban spreads government-made news to Americans.
[00:37:48.201 --> 00:37:53.884]  They're going to say it's fake, it's false, but it is to help us be good Americans.
[00:37:53.884 --> 00:37:55.105]  That's Obama.
[00:37:55.105 --> 00:37:58.487]  Well, those groups are still in place.
[00:37:58.487 --> 00:38:02.369]  And so, you need to understand, folks, that it's not just us they're hitting with total fake news.
[00:38:03.294 --> 00:38:04.895]  Weaponize fake news.
[00:38:04.895 --> 00:38:14.784]  They're hitting everybody out there and so you cannot believe almost anything you hear out of them anymore unless you know the background and the history.
[00:38:14.784 --> 00:38:20.809]  When it comes out the Clintons are in trials and it's coming out that they were involved in pedophile rings, well of course they are!
[00:38:20.809 --> 00:38:28.195]  I told you when this first cult got busted in New York a few years ago that it was tied into smuggling out of Mexico and kidnapped children and now it's in the news.
[00:38:28.195 --> 00:38:28.935]  That's real!
[00:38:30.063 --> 00:38:37.027]  But when you see them say that I wrote a book with Jim Fetzer and I lost a lawsuit, I'm not on the book.
[00:38:37.027 --> 00:38:38.547]  It's not true.
[00:38:38.547 --> 00:38:41.469]  They are testing to see what they can get away with.
[00:38:41.469 --> 00:38:42.950]  So this is next level.
[00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:47.932]  Now, I'm going to plug right now and announce something very exciting.
[00:38:47.932 --> 00:38:50.493]  I got Paul Watson, and I'm not bragging.
[00:38:50.493 --> 00:38:52.294]  I'm smart to do it.
[00:38:52.294 --> 00:38:53.275]  I got Paul Watson.
[00:38:55.439 --> 00:38:58.941]  Six years ago to start his Twitter and his YouTube.
[00:38:58.941 --> 00:39:01.242]  In fact, we set those up and gave them to him.
[00:39:01.242 --> 00:39:02.163]  I said, you need to get on air.
[00:39:02.163 --> 00:39:03.904]  Okay, something happens to me.
[00:39:03.904 --> 00:39:05.305]  You're just as smart as I am or smarter.
[00:39:05.305 --> 00:39:06.525]  You need to be on air.
[00:39:06.525 --> 00:39:11.368]  They can't ever take away the personality you build up and the followers you build up and that you work with.
[00:39:11.368 --> 00:39:12.488]  He did it.
[00:39:12.488 --> 00:39:14.890]  And now he's still able to reach millions a day.
[00:39:16.115 --> 00:39:19.518]  I encouraged him to start his own website, to try to hire his own people.
[00:39:19.518 --> 00:39:20.659]  He didn't want to do all that.
[00:39:20.659 --> 00:39:21.780]  They started banning him.
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:25.743]  He's getting ready to hire people, build a studio, launch his own thing.
[00:39:25.743 --> 00:39:27.185]  I told him, get a subscribe star.
[00:39:27.185 --> 00:39:28.706]  That hadn't been censored, people.
[00:39:28.706 --> 00:39:32.009]  I told him, get folks to donate, because I had to cut his pay by more than half.
[00:39:32.549 --> 00:39:34.830]  Because they're trying to kill us.
[00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.991]  And he's an older employee, been there 18 years.
[00:39:36.991 --> 00:39:38.311]  He's highly paid.
[00:39:38.311 --> 00:39:40.632]  Owen Schroyer is not highly paid compared to Paul.
[00:39:40.632 --> 00:39:42.432]  He deserves a lot more, but he's a great guy.
[00:39:42.432 --> 00:39:43.713]  Never asked for more money.
[00:39:43.713 --> 00:39:44.833]  But he's frustrated.
[00:39:44.833 --> 00:39:46.274]  He wants to build new sites.
[00:39:46.274 --> 00:39:47.574]  He wants to do new things.
[00:39:47.574 --> 00:39:49.515]  I said, listen, start a subscribe star.
[00:39:49.515 --> 00:39:50.195]  Still work here?
[00:39:50.475 --> 00:40:01.060]  We'll amplify you, we'll promote you, we'll still pay you, but that extra money that comes in, you can spend it to build your own operation in case they put me in prison, which they're getting close to trying to do.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:07.263]  They're currently on the news in Connecticut, saying I need to be arrested for sending child porn, because they sent it to me in my email, whoever did it.
[00:40:07.723 --> 00:40:09.824]  And they're saying I death-threatened somebody, which I didn't.
[00:40:09.824 --> 00:40:10.905]  They want me arrested.
[00:40:10.905 --> 00:40:12.266]  They're talking about arresting me.
[00:40:12.266 --> 00:40:15.728]  So we've got to, we've got to build new systems as well.
[00:40:15.728 --> 00:40:18.570]  So Owen, tell folks about your subscribe star you've launched.
[00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:20.831]  We launched a subscribe star for myself.
[00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:22.952]  We've gotten a lot of people to donate.
[00:40:22.952 --> 00:40:24.253]  It's just the beginning.
[00:40:24.253 --> 00:40:27.895]  Subscribe star forward slash Alex Jones.
[00:40:27.895 --> 00:40:31.097]  Again, subscribe star forward slash, is that actually a URL?
[00:40:31.477 --> 00:40:35.020]  You have a subscribe star without a dot forward slash Alex Jones?
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.484]  I'll discover what the URL is at some point and let you know, folks.
[00:40:38.484 --> 00:40:41.707]  But Owen, tell us about this.
[00:40:41.707 --> 00:40:43.488]  I mean, do you like my idea?
[00:40:43.488 --> 00:40:45.210]  Well, here's the thing, Alex.
[00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:48.393]  Next to you, I'm one of the most banned names out there.
[00:40:48.393 --> 00:40:49.534]  I'm not allowed on YouTube.
[00:40:49.534 --> 00:40:50.415]  Paul is still allowed.
[00:40:50.415 --> 00:40:51.496]  I'm not allowed on Facebook.
[00:40:51.496 --> 00:40:52.217]  Paul is still allowed.
[00:40:52.217 --> 00:40:53.438]  I still have my Twitter.
[00:40:53.438 --> 00:40:55.019]  When I did my video this morning,
[00:40:56.013 --> 00:40:58.054]  Launching my subscribe star on Twitter.
[00:40:58.054 --> 00:41:12.019]  It was it was blocked and shut down so There is no other outlet Alex I mean this is what we have to do and if we can find other platforms where we know we're not going to be banned and We where we know they're gonna let us monetize and they take a very small percentage.
[00:41:12.019 --> 00:41:15.480]  They don't steal our data They don't steal our private information.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:20.401]  I think subscribe star takes a very very tiny little percentage I they even show you in the numbers.
[00:41:20.401 --> 00:41:21.662]  It's very small so
[00:41:23.407 --> 00:41:33.535]  The exciting thing for me is, Alex, as you're pushing me to do this and create more content, is I am going to create new, original content on the Subscribe Star for my subscribers that you can't get anywhere else.
[00:41:33.535 --> 00:41:37.978]  Now, I don't want people to think that this means I'm not working at InfoWars anymore, because I'm not.
[00:41:37.978 --> 00:41:38.599]  Of course I am.
[00:41:39.259 --> 00:41:42.260]  And I'll still be doing the War Room every weekday, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.221]  Central at InfoWars.com slash show.
[00:41:44.221 --> 00:41:47.623]  As long as this mothership is still in air, I will be here.
[00:41:47.623 --> 00:41:58.648]  But the Subscribe Star that I've launched is just because I'm not allowed on any other platforms and because I have to create another outlet for myself because I know what's happening here.
[00:41:58.648 --> 00:42:00.308]  I see what happens behind the scenes.
[00:42:00.308 --> 00:42:01.529]  I see the attacks that you're under.
[00:42:02.049 --> 00:42:09.135]  And Alex, you know, you're just like number one target and people want to discount, you know, you or me because I work at InfoWars.
[00:42:09.135 --> 00:42:12.378]  So, oh yeah, Schreuer gets banned off YouTube, Facebook.
[00:42:12.378 --> 00:42:13.238]  I hate working at InfoWars.
[00:42:13.238 --> 00:42:13.819]  Nobody cares.
[00:42:13.819 --> 00:42:14.680]  You know, it's no big deal.
[00:42:15.305 --> 00:42:19.686]  But if they shut InfoWars down, well all of a sudden I don't have a platform anymore.
[00:42:19.686 --> 00:42:24.568]  So I have to find a platform, I have to create my own content, and that's why I've started the Subscribestar.
[00:42:24.568 --> 00:42:30.270]  And we've got the URLs if you want to subscribe to mine at subscribestar.com slash owen dash royer.
[00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:33.711]  Alex's is subscribestar.com slash alexjones.
[00:42:33.711 --> 00:42:36.332]  And this is just what we have to do in the midst of all this censorship, Alex.
[00:42:37.072 --> 00:42:37.652]  Absolutely.
[00:42:37.652 --> 00:42:40.154]  And you know, I get paid the big bucks as I'm conscious and awake.
[00:42:40.154 --> 00:42:44.376]  I noticed the graphics we put out said Subscribestar forward slash Alex Jones.
[00:42:44.376 --> 00:42:45.696]  That's not it, folks.
[00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:48.998]  It's Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[00:42:48.998 --> 00:42:50.259]  Always got to have that dot.
[00:42:50.259 --> 00:42:52.860]  Subscribestar.com forward slash Owen Dash Sawyer.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.261]  We'll be back to cover some news on the other side.
[00:42:55.261 --> 00:42:56.222]  Thank you very much, Owen.

[00:45:50.108 --> 00:45:51.611]  I stayed up late last night, so I
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:03.388]  And get the visuals!
[00:47:03.388 --> 00:47:05.992]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:25.948 --> 00:47:31.514]  So, Owen Stroyer has arrived in Chattanooga, New York, and is broadcasting his show in the War Room.
[00:47:31.514 --> 00:47:32.635]  Roger Stone can't come on.
[00:47:32.635 --> 00:47:37.801]  They're trying to put him in prison, and he has a gag order on him, and it's all fake, and he's been in court challenging.
[00:47:37.801 --> 00:47:38.702]  Where's the proof?
[00:47:38.702 --> 00:47:40.523]  Russia hacked the election, and they admit there isn't!
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.842]  But then they're charging him with being involved in that.
[00:47:43.842 --> 00:47:45.564]  Absolute loads of BS.
[00:47:45.564 --> 00:47:47.345]  And they're trying to put me in prison now.
[00:47:47.345 --> 00:47:50.067]  A lot of folks are like, well, we better go along with it.
[00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:51.048]  Oh, yeah.
[00:47:51.048 --> 00:47:55.812]  I've got a stack of news, mainstream media saying, what's wrong with sex with children?
[00:47:55.812 --> 00:47:58.194]  And the Democratic Party pushing it everywhere.
[00:47:58.194 --> 00:48:00.736]  And the leftists in Europe pushing pedophilia.
[00:48:00.736 --> 00:48:01.477]  Oh, but then...
[00:48:02.157 --> 00:48:06.820]  Alex Jones is the bad person, because he opposes pedophilia.
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:18.166]  Somebody sends him 12 emails with hidden child porn links, and the Democrats subpoena my emails on Sandy Hook, and they find them, and they're gonna protect the children.
[00:48:18.166 --> 00:48:24.370]  In between NBC News, Hillary covered up, pedophile ring at the State Department!
[00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:27.792]  NBC News, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:48:27.792 --> 00:48:29.953]  NBC News, they're not gonna hide this.
[00:48:31.485 --> 00:48:32.805]  And Owen, that's the exciting thing.
[00:48:32.805 --> 00:48:34.666]  Trump came out on Sunday.
[00:48:34.666 --> 00:48:36.926]  They cut it out of the official ABC News.
[00:48:36.926 --> 00:48:37.987]  You can't find it anywhere.
[00:48:37.987 --> 00:48:39.687]  I've asked listeners to send it to the Showtips.
[00:48:39.687 --> 00:48:40.667]  We've looked through it.
[00:48:40.667 --> 00:48:42.488]  Maybe we've missed your email.
[00:48:42.488 --> 00:48:45.388]  But Trump, I think I know who was behind 9-11.
[00:48:45.388 --> 00:48:50.270]  It's in the transcript, but no coverage that the President is threatening to expose who really did 9-11.
[00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:51.010]  How big is that, Owen?
[00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:55.352]  Well, you've got that combined with all the arrests of the pedophiles.
[00:48:55.352 --> 00:49:01.136]  You just had Operation Broken Heart get no, and I mean zero, mainstream media attention.
[00:49:01.136 --> 00:49:02.216]  1,700 arrested!
[00:49:02.216 --> 00:49:04.078]  Not just with child porn, with kids!
[00:49:04.078 --> 00:49:10.982]  And that isn't Trump just putting out, you know, a statement to get the media attention, which they ignored the 9-11 statement.
[00:49:10.982 --> 00:49:12.823]  This is actual pedophiles being busted.
[00:49:13.143 --> 00:49:18.165]  This is Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer's financial records being tied to the Nexivim sex cult.
[00:49:18.165 --> 00:49:18.905]  It's all happening.
[00:49:18.905 --> 00:49:20.766]  They're reopening the Epstein files.
[00:49:20.766 --> 00:49:22.747]  All this is happening against zero media coverage.
[00:49:22.747 --> 00:49:27.409]  This is why they want InfoWars shut down, because we will cover it, Alex.
[00:49:27.409 --> 00:49:29.449]  So I don't know what it takes for the American people to wake up.
[00:49:29.449 --> 00:49:30.450]  Think about this, Alex.
[00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:31.630]  Let's not go so Nexil.
[00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:33.391]  Most people can't handle the pedophilia stuff.
[00:49:33.391 --> 00:49:34.471]  They don't even know where to start, 9-11.
[00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:38.113]  The left's religion is hurting your children.
[00:49:38.113 --> 00:49:38.453]  But Alex,
[00:49:39.173 --> 00:49:46.635]  Look at the, even Fox News is running polls today, all week long, but today saying Trump is trailing six Democrats in Florida.
[00:49:46.635 --> 00:49:49.976]  And rightfully, the head of the campaign said, polling is dead.
[00:49:49.976 --> 00:49:50.916]  It's completely fake.
[00:49:50.916 --> 00:49:53.296]  They sample 15, 20 points more Democrats.
[00:49:53.296 --> 00:49:54.317]  That's just one scam.
[00:49:54.317 --> 00:49:56.857]  Remember three years ago, the last scam?
[00:49:56.857 --> 00:49:59.698]  Remember how after election day, they were all wrong except us?
[00:50:00.563 --> 00:50:08.669]  And then you have a deep state leftist FBI agent in the state of Missouri fabricate evidence to remove a conservative governor.
[00:50:08.669 --> 00:50:10.431]  So they're totally active.
[00:50:10.431 --> 00:50:17.416]  And if people can't, if there's no sirens going off in people's heads and the alarm bells aren't sounding now, Alex, I don't know what it's going to take.
[00:50:17.416 --> 00:50:20.919]  Does the president have to take a bullet to the head for people to realize what the hell's going on?
[00:50:20.919 --> 00:50:21.660]  That's my next point.
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:40.669]  Moles inside the administration putting out the lie that we've been attacking the Russian power grid for two months under Trump's orders in an attempt to create a giant rift of a diplomatic and military crisis the likes of which we haven't seen pretty much ever and Trump says it's treason and it's dangerous and it is and they just move on to new hoaxes.
[00:50:40.669 --> 00:50:41.909]  I'm going to say this again.
[00:50:41.909 --> 00:50:43.030]  Please put it on screen for TV viewers.
[00:50:44.076 --> 00:50:56.499]  The top of Twitter since yesterday morning is a AP article that says that I wrote a book about Sandy Hook not happening and that I lost the lawsuit and that I'm involved in child porn.
[00:50:56.499 --> 00:50:59.760]  None of it is true, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.081]  Now, what does that mean?
[00:51:02.081 --> 00:51:04.681]  It means they may be getting ready to kill Trump within days.
[00:51:04.681 --> 00:51:07.182]  I'm telling you, they don't do stuff like that.
[00:51:07.182 --> 00:51:07.962]  We've called AP.
[00:51:07.962 --> 00:51:09.462]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:09.462 --> 00:51:11.603]  I have had lawyers call
[00:51:13.627 --> 00:51:15.469]  AP and say that is not our book.
[00:51:15.469 --> 00:51:16.590]  We did not lose a lawsuit.
[00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:18.812]  And they go, we've called up to higher ups.
[00:51:18.812 --> 00:51:20.673]  They just say it's staying up.
[00:51:20.673 --> 00:51:22.034]  But you know, it's not true.
[00:51:22.034 --> 00:51:22.995]  Jones didn't write this book.
[00:51:22.995 --> 00:51:24.196]  They go, we don't care.
[00:51:24.196 --> 00:51:25.637]  That's the way it is now.
[00:51:25.637 --> 00:51:30.562]  So, I mean, this is next level, my friend, this is next level.
[00:51:31.391 --> 00:51:35.112]  Well the question is, what do we have to do to wake the public up?
[00:51:35.112 --> 00:51:40.073]  You know, they don't want them seeing your broadcast, that's why they ban InfoWars off all social media.
[00:51:40.073 --> 00:51:41.353]  Remember Baghdad Bob?
[00:51:41.353 --> 00:51:50.455]  When the F-15s are dropping thousand pound bombs two miles behind him and there's explosions go off, he goes, the Americans, we kicked them in the Kuwait, 2003.
[00:51:50.455 --> 00:51:54.116]  We defeat their armies, bloody God!
[00:51:54.116 --> 00:51:55.096]  Bombs are going off behind him.
[00:51:56.736 --> 00:51:57.376]  It's the same thing.
[00:51:57.376 --> 00:51:59.137]  It's like Baghdad Bob now.
[00:51:59.137 --> 00:52:07.101]  I mean, they're just up there telling you that Trump's a racist and we're going to defeat you and we're at war with Russia and none of that's even true.
[00:52:07.101 --> 00:52:11.803]  Well, Trump isn't part of this criminal cabal that expands his worldwide.
[00:52:12.583 --> 00:52:21.792]  For example, we find out about the Deep State running this electric grid hack in Russia, and they're running it without Trump's permission.
[00:52:21.792 --> 00:52:25.296]  They literally say in the article, yeah, we didn't go to Trump because we thought he would shut it down.
[00:52:25.296 --> 00:52:26.297]  So they're doing that.
[00:52:26.297 --> 00:52:33.003]  So what makes me think now, after seeing what happened in the Strait of Hormuz, what makes me think now that that's not another
[00:52:33.624 --> 00:52:38.646]  You know, some sort of John Bolton proxy army going out there to start another war out there.
[00:52:38.646 --> 00:52:39.966]  So they're trying to do it in Russia?
[00:52:39.966 --> 00:52:41.287]  Maybe they're trying to do it in Iran, too.
[00:52:41.287 --> 00:52:43.647]  These are the same people that have been starting wars for 20 years.
[00:52:43.647 --> 00:52:45.228]  Trump is not involved with them.
[00:52:45.228 --> 00:52:46.848]  That's why they had to get him out of power.
[00:52:46.848 --> 00:52:48.649]  They need war all the time.
[00:52:48.649 --> 00:52:49.529]  Trump doesn't want that.
[00:52:49.529 --> 00:52:51.010]  He's a businessman, not a war hunter.
[00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:51.630]  It's crazy.
[00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:52.830]  It's totally crazy.
[00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:54.191]  Getting back to this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:55.273 --> 00:53:04.785]  We're doing a lot of things to fund operations, but the big thing I'm doing is, I told Paul, who's a great guy, I said, I need you to set up your own operations.
[00:53:04.785 --> 00:53:05.767]  And he didn't do it.
[00:53:06.727 --> 00:53:08.967]  And he said, look, I work 15 hours a day already.
[00:53:08.967 --> 00:53:10.728]  I don't want to lead people.
[00:53:10.728 --> 00:53:12.188]  I said, but you are a leader, Paul.
[00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:16.169]  So then all the censorship has made him get really aggressive, and he's going to set up his own operation.
[00:53:16.169 --> 00:53:17.749]  He'll still work with us.
[00:53:17.749 --> 00:53:23.050]  And he has his subscribe star that we'll put on screen that's raising $20,000 a month.
[00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:23.750]  That's great.
[00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:29.111]  It takes that for equipment and some crew members and some writers and to form an organization that does any good.
[00:53:29.111 --> 00:53:31.552]  It'll probably take $100,000 a month, especially in London.
[00:53:31.552 --> 00:53:32.232]  It's very expensive.
[00:53:33.052 --> 00:53:34.013]  That's what's happening.
[00:53:34.013 --> 00:53:38.857]  People are supporting him, and that is amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:38.857 --> 00:53:41.739]  Again, SubscribeStar.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[00:53:41.739 --> 00:53:44.641]  Go there, whether it's a dollar, five dollars, ten dollars a month.
[00:53:44.641 --> 00:53:51.747]  We're going to have a thing setting up where if you give twenty-five dollars or more, we will give you a gift from InfoWars, like a t-shirt or something.
[00:53:51.747 --> 00:53:54.609]  But the point is, is this is a very successful system.
[00:53:54.609 --> 00:53:56.351]  It allows people to have a subscription.
[00:53:57.429 --> 00:54:01.653]  That way we get, you know, most of the money instead of only part of it with products we sell.
[00:54:01.653 --> 00:54:02.594]  And that way we can operate.
[00:54:02.594 --> 00:54:07.679]  Go to Subscribestar.com forward slash Owen dash Troyer.
[00:54:07.679 --> 00:54:09.800]  S-H-R-O-Y-E-R.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:10.101]  And then...
[00:54:11.704 --> 00:54:17.468]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're running a huge special, the Save InfoWars special right now.
[00:54:17.468 --> 00:54:21.552]  Store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50% off.
[00:54:21.552 --> 00:54:30.198]  You sign up for auto-ship on things you're gonna want, like toothpaste and high-quality coffee and things, and protein bars, you're getting an additional 10% off.
[00:54:30.198 --> 00:54:32.180]  That makes some of these loss leaders.
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:37.064]  So we have to sell a lot of product to fund the operation, but people love these sales.
[00:54:37.064 --> 00:54:41.107]  So there's a Help Save InfoWars donation button right in the middle of infowarsstore.com.
[00:54:42.299 --> 00:54:44.660]  Separately, local AM and FM affiliates.
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.561]  I don't want this to go on one ear and out the other.
[00:54:46.561 --> 00:54:48.803]  If you want to help win the fight, then here is your mission.
[00:54:48.803 --> 00:54:52.685]  If you choose to accept it like they say in Mission Impossible, this is Mission Possible.
[00:54:52.685 --> 00:54:53.825]  Call that local station.
[00:54:53.825 --> 00:54:55.446]  Thank them.
[00:54:55.446 --> 00:54:56.527]  Become a sponsor.
[00:54:56.527 --> 00:54:57.788]  Support their sponsors.
[00:54:57.788 --> 00:55:03.331]  Or, like a tithe, send them $20 a month, $100 a month, whatever you can.
[00:55:03.331 --> 00:55:06.392]  There are a lot of folks sitting on the fence.
[00:55:06.392 --> 00:55:10.675]  You know, the Warren Buffett types that never spend any money and is penny-pinched like Scrooge McDuck.
[00:55:11.937 --> 00:55:21.741]  We're going to lose the whole culture and the whole society if people don't start bellying up to the fight and putting their money down on the masthead, on the barrelhead.
[00:55:21.741 --> 00:55:22.641]  That's what it's all about.
[00:55:22.641 --> 00:55:23.682]  So it's simple.
[00:55:23.682 --> 00:55:25.042]  Get your high-quality fish oil.
[00:55:25.042 --> 00:55:27.883]  Get your Brain Force, your Turbo Force.
[00:55:27.883 --> 00:55:31.145]  Get your high-quality protein bars that we have.
[00:55:31.145 --> 00:55:34.426]  Now, they sell them the similar bars for like $6, $7 at Whole Foods.
[00:55:34.426 --> 00:55:36.867]  Regular price for these is $3 a piece in the box.
[00:55:38.083 --> 00:55:40.704]  Two different great flavors.
[00:55:40.704 --> 00:55:41.625]  It's amazing.
[00:55:41.625 --> 00:55:45.046]  And when they're discounted, they're less than $3 a piece.
[00:55:45.046 --> 00:55:46.087]  And by the way, there's no filler.
[00:55:46.087 --> 00:55:48.508]  A lot of people go, man, these are chewy and they last so long.
[00:55:48.508 --> 00:55:50.068]  Yeah, people are used to fillers.
[00:55:50.068 --> 00:55:51.549]  I said no fillers to the factory.
[00:55:52.637 --> 00:55:54.059]  We may put out a brand that has fillers.
[00:55:54.059 --> 00:55:54.740]  People are used to that.
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.621]  But people like them too.
[00:55:55.621 --> 00:55:56.983]  But it's heavy duty.
[00:55:56.983 --> 00:56:00.307]  You're like, whoa, this is like toffee or something.
[00:56:00.307 --> 00:56:01.789]  But there's not the crap in it.
[00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:03.972]  It actually tastes like toffee.
[00:56:03.972 --> 00:56:05.154]  So it's next level.
[00:56:05.154 --> 00:56:07.457]  But some folks are used to things that have corn and a bunch of wheat in them.
[00:56:07.457 --> 00:56:09.079]  And so it's like, it's a bunch of air.
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:10.180]  No.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:11.020]  No fillers.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:11.841]  No fillers.
[00:56:11.841 --> 00:56:12.581]  No fillers.
[00:56:12.581 --> 00:56:13.441]  No fillers.
[00:56:13.441 --> 00:56:16.862]  Get it all 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:56:16.862 --> 00:56:18.702]  We have it in peanut butter and chocolate.
[00:56:18.702 --> 00:56:20.403]  We have it in coconut and chocolate.
[00:56:20.403 --> 00:56:25.144]  Again, at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:56:25.144 --> 00:56:27.585]  And yes, we've been putting out the call for help a lot lately.
[00:56:27.585 --> 00:56:35.927]  You might have seen in the news, they are trying to shut us down and using the last thing they've got before they kill you, and that is child porn.
[00:56:36.647 --> 00:56:37.107]  What do they do?
[00:56:37.107 --> 00:56:38.148]  They send you emails.
[00:56:38.148 --> 00:56:39.329]  They're hidden attachments.
[00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:40.429]  You never open them.
[00:56:40.429 --> 00:56:41.730]  You never even open the email.
[00:56:41.730 --> 00:56:43.851]  You don't know it's there.
[00:56:43.851 --> 00:56:48.374]  And then they subpoena you for those exact emails and say, we've got child porn!
[00:56:48.374 --> 00:56:49.895]  Jones has got child porn!
[00:56:49.895 --> 00:56:53.777]  These people are unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:54.838]  And it just gets sick.
[00:56:54.838 --> 00:56:58.720]  And then I talk about it, so I'm sanctioned by the judge.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:05.685]  Sanctioned for getting angry about this and getting upset about all this while Hillary Clinton is caught running.
[00:57:06.565 --> 00:57:09.187]  Pedophile ratings of the State Department, NBC News.
[00:57:09.187 --> 00:57:10.608]  Unbelievable.
[00:57:10.608 --> 00:57:14.891]  Owen Schroer, Subscribestar.com forward slash Owen dash Schroer.
[00:57:14.891 --> 00:57:16.152]  You'll be on 3 p.m.
[00:57:16.152 --> 00:57:17.753]  Central Standard Time today.
[00:57:17.753 --> 00:57:19.294]  Again, are you excited about this?
[00:57:19.294 --> 00:57:27.020]  Well, the difference between my Subscribestar and I think others is because I have no other platform other than InfoWars and Subscribestar, they ban me everywhere on YouTube and Facebook.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:32.304]  I'm actually going to be putting exclusive content up there, actually some original political comedy that I've been thinking about doing.
[00:57:32.304 --> 00:57:32.924]  I didn't know that.
[00:57:32.924 --> 00:57:33.284]  Wait, wait, wait.
[00:57:33.284 --> 00:57:34.905]  You can put content on Subscribestar?
[00:57:34.905 --> 00:57:35.086]  Yes.
[00:57:35.766 --> 00:57:37.546]  That's the thing I'm learning about this is so exciting.
[00:57:37.546 --> 00:57:40.047]  I'm still learning it too, but yes.
[00:57:40.047 --> 00:57:41.507]  I'm very excited about that.
[00:57:41.507 --> 00:57:42.707]  So this is awesome.
[00:57:42.707 --> 00:57:46.608]  All right, hour number two with why the enemy wants to shut down.
[00:57:46.608 --> 00:57:47.028]  Stay with us.
[00:57:47.028 --> 00:57:54.469]  I just want listeners to understand money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[00:57:54.469 --> 00:57:58.330]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off.
[00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:02.110]  But we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:04.331]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price.
[00:58:04.331 --> 00:58:04.991]  And we're moving it.
[00:58:05.371 --> 00:58:06.232]  I don't know.
[00:58:24.804 --> 00:58:25.764]  I like to be expanding.
[00:58:25.764 --> 00:58:26.524]  I like to be winning.
[00:58:26.524 --> 00:58:27.245]  I like to be fighting.
[00:58:27.245 --> 00:58:28.445]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[00:58:28.445 --> 00:58:29.305]  That's why we're so hated.
[00:58:29.305 --> 00:58:30.925]  But we need to be retreaded.
[00:58:30.925 --> 00:58:32.166]  We need to be tuned up.
[00:58:32.166 --> 00:58:33.206]  We need to be fixed up.
[00:58:33.206 --> 00:58:34.526]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[00:58:34.526 --> 00:58:36.066]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[00:58:36.066 --> 00:58:38.387]  And the enemy wants to silence us.
[00:58:38.387 --> 00:58:40.907]  Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[00:58:40.907 --> 00:58:42.908]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[00:58:42.908 --> 00:58:45.748]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor.
[00:58:45.748 --> 00:58:47.189]  Funded by foreign banks and the TICOM.
[00:58:47.189 --> 00:58:48.849]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[00:58:50.955 --> 00:58:54.574]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:58:55.134 --> 00:59:05.520]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:10.363]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[00:59:10.363 --> 00:59:24.872]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little-d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting InfoWars.
[00:59:24.972 --> 00:59:34.159]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[00:59:34.159 --> 00:59:42.745]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[00:59:42.745 --> 00:59:46.067]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment.
[00:59:46.067 --> 00:59:49.450]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[00:59:52.913 --> 00:59:55.522]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.939 --> 01:00:25.369]  President Trump and ICE have a long road ahead when it comes to the deportation of millions of illegals, which Trump has declared must be done.
[01:00:25.369 --> 01:00:29.413]  And beginning next week, the ICE Blitz will begin.
[01:00:29.413 --> 01:00:38.563]  Anything worth doing is worth doing right, because as the campaign trail appears over the horizon... Let's start a real physical revolution if you're talking about it.
[01:00:38.843 --> 01:00:46.751]  Polls have shown that Americans are largely concerned with the garbage fire that is our southwestern border.
[01:00:46.751 --> 01:00:54.039]  Americans are concerned with immigration over all the problems, economic or non-economic, according to a Gallup poll.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:58.305]  Only to the number one issue concerning Americans.
[01:00:58.305 --> 01:01:07.138]  The issue that those lollygagging around in the taxpayer-fueled halls of the United States Congress are an embarrassment to our republic.
[01:01:07.138 --> 01:01:10.343]  That is the number one issue Americans are concerned with.
[01:01:10.803 --> 01:01:16.385]  As Trump's tariffs on Mexico worked, as The Week had to admit, Mexico blinked.
[01:01:16.385 --> 01:01:23.747]  It has promised that 6,000 troops from the Mexican National Guard will now patrol their own southern border with Guatemala.
[01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:34.031]  Mexico also agreed to expand the migration protection protocols that require some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their applications for entry to the U.S.
[01:01:34.031 --> 01:01:34.751]  are processed.
[01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:37.372]  This is the clear Trump triumph.
[01:01:37.372 --> 01:01:43.957]  The tariffs that President Trump used, he got in two days more than Congress did in 20 years on this.
[01:01:43.957 --> 01:01:47.759]  We've got troops down at the southern border that Mexico has deployed.
[01:01:47.759 --> 01:01:59.126]  We've got Mexico committing to take the phony asylum seekers onto Mexican soil, which will deter further immigration from the Northern Triangle down at the southern border of Mexico.
[01:01:59.126 --> 01:02:02.328]  Meanwhile, the garbage fire on the border rages on.
[01:02:02.648 --> 01:02:12.996]  President Trump's administration estimates that roughly 12 million illegals, mainly from Central America and Mexico, are roaming around the United States.
[01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:16.839]  9 out of 10 of which will never return to their asylum court hearings.
[01:02:16.839 --> 01:02:21.043]  But those numbers could easily be double the 12 million estimation.
[01:02:21.343 --> 01:02:33.771]  Add to that the left's blockade against ICE, who have labeled the organization as every conceivable fantastical fascistic group which we can assume is beginning to boil as I speak.
[01:02:33.771 --> 01:02:37.813]  What we need to do is to understand what is really motivating this effort.
[01:02:37.813 --> 01:02:39.134]  It's cruelty.
[01:02:39.134 --> 01:02:40.134]  It's cruelty.
[01:02:40.134 --> 01:02:47.319]  What Donald Trump did yesterday, what he announced via Twitter, and this may sound hyperbolic to some folk, it was a terroristic act.
[01:02:47.819 --> 01:03:04.270]  Recently, Fox News sent a Swiss journalist to San Antonio, Texas to speak with the French-speaking Congolese refugees to get a sense of who is supporting their journey across the Atlantic Ocean, only to discover the immigrants were carrying wads of $100 bills.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:22.542]  I had the impression that somebody told them not to speak about it.
[01:03:22.542 --> 01:03:27.005]  And when they said, we're here now in the States, why do you ask about our past?
[01:03:27.005 --> 01:03:31.088]  And then came a very aggressive kind of claim, give me help.
[01:03:31.088 --> 01:03:32.909]  Now we're here, you have to help us.
[01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:33.650]  Give us money.
[01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:44.397]  Through an aid worker there, he said they actually do have money, quite a few of them, because he spotted them under a tree, right in front of the shelter, counting their roll of money with $100 bills.
[01:03:45.598 --> 01:03:46.798]  They're handing that out.
[01:03:46.798 --> 01:03:47.799]  It's in French.
[01:03:47.799 --> 01:03:52.881]  They're handing that out to the migrants and they're telling them their rights.
[01:03:52.881 --> 01:03:56.922]  And when it comes to ICE, it says, ICE is government.
[01:03:56.922 --> 01:03:58.923]  They are not your friends.
[01:03:58.923 --> 01:04:03.885]  And as a Swiss, I think, you know, what's this kind of information?
[01:04:03.885 --> 01:04:10.407]  And you flip the page and it comes again with ICE and says, ICE is kind of police.
[01:04:10.407 --> 01:04:11.388]  They are not friendly.
[01:04:11.388 --> 01:04:13.829]  Don't ever tell them anything confidential.
[01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:16.110]  This is outrageous.
[01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:25.198]  So this is an NGO, non-governmental organization, assisting aid workers, telling the migrants who are going to get money from the U.S.
[01:04:25.198 --> 01:04:26.959]  taxpayers not to cooperate with the government.
[01:04:26.959 --> 01:04:36.507]  Whatever it takes to reclaim some semblance of our citizenship, our sovereignty, and our future as a nation must be addressed hastily.
[01:04:36.787 --> 01:04:50.036]  Otherwise, we are facing a point of no return, orchestrated by a myriad of globalist anti-American organizations that are feeding a national cancer that has gone untreated for decades.
[01:04:50.036 --> 01:04:52.037]  We'll be back.
[01:04:58.564 --> 01:05:01.146]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[01:05:01.146 --> 01:05:12.692]  We're going into the season of war, and they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud, and we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[01:05:12.692 --> 01:05:13.613]  We need to end here.
[01:05:13.613 --> 01:05:15.574]  We need to be provisioned, and you've got my
[01:05:15.854 --> 01:05:19.515]  Total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:23.376]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[01:05:23.376 --> 01:05:25.297]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[01:05:25.297 --> 01:05:30.278]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[01:05:30.278 --> 01:05:33.599]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[01:05:33.599 --> 01:05:34.439]  I need gas.
[01:05:34.439 --> 01:05:35.960]  I need ammo politically now.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:43.763]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[01:05:43.763 --> 01:05:45.184]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[01:05:45.184 --> 01:05:52.207]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[01:05:52.207 --> 01:05:53.188]  You have my commitment.
[01:05:53.188 --> 01:05:57.550]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[01:05:59.278 --> 01:06:00.579]  We've got it.
[01:06:00.579 --> 01:06:06.401]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:06.401 --> 01:06:08.683]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:08.683 --> 01:06:10.784]  Alright, here I go.
[01:06:10.784 --> 01:06:17.107]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:06:17.107 --> 01:06:21.129]  Are we seeing the universe?
[01:06:21.129 --> 01:06:22.990]  We've got it.
[01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:26.751]  Are we seeing the universe now?
[01:06:26.751 --> 01:06:27.752]  We've got it.
[01:06:29.708 --> 01:06:32.470]  Moonraker.
[01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:37.534]  Zardoz.
[01:06:37.534 --> 01:06:40.196]  Logan's Run.
[01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:44.139]  So many movies back in the 70s and 80s.
[01:06:44.139 --> 01:06:55.228]  So many science fiction books about world government run by a group of scientists who want to reduce world population by 99%.
[01:06:57.918 --> 01:07:11.386]  Now, Moonraker was written back in the 1960s by Ian Fleming, who'd been high-level OSS and then MI6 when they founded that in British intelligence.
[01:07:11.386 --> 01:07:26.796]  Now, you've seen The Kingsman, where you've got a rich group of billionaires that are going to send a code frequency over cell phones that are going to make people become violent, irritable, and start killing each other.
[01:07:27.878 --> 01:07:36.686]  And if you pull back and you think about Netflix, which I only watch in the morning sometimes if I decide to not watch news.
[01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:40.589]  I guess every once in a while with my wife.
[01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:50.638]  When you tune into it, almost all the science fiction movies that they're churning out on a weekly basis with high production value,
[01:07:52.466 --> 01:08:04.849]  From Bird Box to Mother to all these shows are about worldwide extinction and everyone running around killing each other.
[01:08:04.849 --> 01:08:11.950]  And that's the big secret of Bird Box that no one knew what the movie was about until we said, look at the beginning.
[01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:13.990]  Everybody's on their cell phones.
[01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:18.571]  The people then get activated by a phone call.
[01:08:18.571 --> 01:08:21.692]  It's a digital slash electrochemical triggering weapon.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:28.342]  So I sat back last night and this morning.
[01:08:28.342 --> 01:08:32.724]  I woke up about 3.30, went to bed about 10.
[01:08:32.724 --> 01:08:38.527]  And I sat at the kitchen table with a piece of paper.
[01:08:38.527 --> 01:08:47.832]  And I sat there for a good three hours until folks started getting up about 6.30 in the morning.
[01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:51.134]  And I sat back and I said, how do I warn people?
[01:08:51.134 --> 01:08:52.715]  And the answer is just cut right to the chase.
[01:08:54.497 --> 01:09:03.782]  I don't know if aliens are running this, but the way the technologies are coming out so fast in a lot of it doesn't look human-made.
[01:09:03.782 --> 01:09:06.724]  The way the government's so secretive and compartmentalized, the way the U.S.
[01:09:06.724 --> 01:09:11.587]  seems to develop it all first, then dole it out.
[01:09:11.587 --> 01:09:17.710]  And what all the technology does is poison us, sterilize us, and make us stupid.
[01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:18.651]  All the Trojan horses
[01:09:20.501 --> 01:09:38.413]  are Pavlovianly training us, conditioning us, ending our human relationships, and making people irritable and aggressive in thousands of studies on smartphones, TVs, and flicker rates.
[01:09:38.413 --> 01:09:41.275]  And I've been led into classified DARPA facilities.
[01:09:41.275 --> 01:09:45.738]  I didn't even realize what was happening at the time that I was being recruited.
[01:09:47.079 --> 01:09:54.923]  Almost 20 years ago, and I was not recruited, but I was allowed to see some of it.
[01:09:54.923 --> 01:09:57.664]  And it was all about flicker rate.
[01:09:57.664 --> 01:09:59.285]  It was all about mesmerizing you.
[01:09:59.285 --> 01:10:03.847]  It was all about addicting you.
[01:10:03.847 --> 01:10:12.010]  This was just University of Texas facilities, where the doors all said DARPA, but explained only authorized personnel.
[01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:12.951]  It didn't say classified.
[01:10:13.902 --> 01:10:26.746]  They then had computer screens to classified facilities around Texas, like the Primate Research Facility, the largest in the world in Bastrop, Texas.
[01:10:26.746 --> 01:10:31.287]  Now, let's cut right to the chase here.
[01:10:31.287 --> 01:10:38.969]  I don't know if Trump knows this, but the establishment knows, and they have laid out a grid worldwide
[01:10:40.143 --> 01:11:02.849]  of systems that don't just track the Internet of Things, that don't just surveil everything you do, but that patently, I'll show you all even government documents, reports, studies, kill you, give you cancer, at an accelerated rate, way worse than smoking three packs of cigarettes a day.
[01:11:02.849 --> 01:11:06.830]  And they can manipulate and throttle the frequencies in 5G
[01:11:08.643 --> 01:11:20.421]  That's going to be every 300 or 400 yards, where they can rattle the DNA and literally split it apart, causing cancer.
[01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:35.414]  They can give you cancer in these studies in a few days of being in proximity to one of these 5G that's turned to an oscillation, where it goes up to a certain frequency and back down, back and forth, very quickly, it breaks DNA.
[01:11:35.414 --> 01:11:49.478]  And they have studies, DARPA did studies on these as weapons, those are declassified in the 70s, where you hit troops with it, they don't know what's happening, they get nauseous, they get irritable, and then they basically die in about a month from cancers all over the body.
[01:11:50.683 --> 01:12:00.485]  So, the government is putting in microwave cancer systems to literally fry you.
[01:12:00.485 --> 01:12:06.287]  The cover story is that it is for communications and super fast downloads.
[01:12:06.287 --> 01:12:07.887]  It has nothing to do with that.
[01:12:07.887 --> 01:12:09.167]  I'm going to go further.
[01:12:09.167 --> 01:12:19.890]  In the Baltimore Sun 20 years ago, there was even an article admitting that cell phone towers were being tested at the time to see if they could calm populations during riots.
[01:12:21.124 --> 01:12:28.471]  I was on Joe Rogan's podcast a few months ago, and I said, type in cell phones, radiation, and human behavior.
[01:12:28.471 --> 01:12:31.033]  He pulled up all the patents, he pulled up all the admissions.
[01:12:31.033 --> 01:12:33.876]  They were like, wow, we didn't know this.
[01:12:33.876 --> 01:12:46.307]  Old fashioned cell phones, who aren't anywhere as strong, and whose waves are larger, not as dangerous, keep the brain within minutes,
[01:12:47.817 --> 01:12:49.278]  One degree.
[01:12:49.278 --> 01:12:50.839]  Just type that in.
[01:12:50.839 --> 01:12:52.199]  Cell phones heat the brain.
[01:12:52.199 --> 01:12:53.960]  You'll get AP, Reuters, all this.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:13:03.225]  And they even tell you, like a pack of cigarettes says can cause cancer, can cause birth defects, can kill you, cause emphysema.
[01:13:03.225 --> 01:13:04.766]  Metaphysically, they have to tell you.
[01:13:05.811 --> 01:13:26.821]  And now, WIRED and the LA Times and the New York Times go, yes, cell phones give rats cancer, and they give humans cancer, and brain tumors associated with cell phones are way up, multi-thousand percent, and yes, 5G's much worse, and yes, 5G's much stronger, and yes, 5G's much smaller waves, and yes, it does fry your DNA.
[01:13:26.821 --> 01:13:28.802]  Your DNA is why your cells replicate.
[01:13:28.802 --> 01:13:33.123]  It's why you get cancer, is when they start malfunctioning and they start having bad code.
[01:13:36.414 --> 01:13:38.296]  This is the big enchilada.
[01:13:38.296 --> 01:13:42.299]  You can talk about vaccines and fluoride and all the studies and what those are doing.
[01:13:42.299 --> 01:13:45.001]  And forced inoculations have now begun in New York.
[01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:49.926]  And they're passing laws and the American Medical Association says we're going to give your kids shots.
[01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:52.588]  We'll offer them money and no more parental consent.
[01:13:52.588 --> 01:13:54.029]  We'll give your kids shots.
[01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:57.232]  California already passed that law as the test five years ago.
[01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:58.293]  All that is secondary.
[01:13:58.293 --> 01:13:59.074]  The GMO.
[01:14:00.504 --> 01:14:05.049]  Manipulating your DNA, causing the rats to be totally infertile within three generations.
[01:14:05.049 --> 01:14:06.831]  All of that was just the heat up.
[01:14:06.831 --> 01:14:12.097]  All the allergies, all the increased cancers, all the increased neurological disorders, all of it.
[01:14:12.097 --> 01:14:14.260]  Oh, and let me tell you what else these systems do.
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:18.624]  Doppler radar, I was told by an engineer, again, this was all like 20 years ago, 23 years ago.
[01:14:22.267 --> 01:14:25.269]  And then I talked to other folks that were aware of it, and I thought they were crazy.
[01:14:25.269 --> 01:14:30.873]  And they said, listen, the power cables are 10 to 20 times stronger going into Doppler radar.
[01:14:30.873 --> 01:14:36.857]  And there's a federal government program to put it in there really to fry the atmosphere and either cause droughts or cause floods.
[01:14:36.857 --> 01:14:38.598]  And then later it was all declassified.
[01:14:38.598 --> 01:14:47.404]  The exact same Doppler antennas are used in the Middle East to make the desert green, to make it rain, to form nuclei, to rattle the water particles.
[01:14:48.655 --> 01:14:55.216]  And dust particles in the air to make it either not rain or rain, or to control storms.
[01:14:55.216 --> 01:14:57.317]  That's now mainstream news.
[01:14:57.317 --> 01:15:02.397]  There's a super advanced technology and civilization that broke away from us, okay?
[01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:16.600]  They just give us the things they want us to have, like a microwave phone to fry our kids' brains, to fry their genitals, to fry their organs, to make them habituate to the phone and not to their parents, and to not have relationships, and all the studies show relationships are falling apart and brain damage is everywhere.
[01:15:18.024 --> 01:15:27.248]  Alzheimer's in like 25-year-olds is setting in, and even BBC studies, the studies they show say that it's because it's causing rewiring of the brain.
[01:15:27.248 --> 01:15:29.769]  This is all killing us!
[01:15:29.769 --> 01:15:33.591]  And they're telling us everywhere what they're doing, how they're doing it.
[01:15:35.046 --> 01:15:36.147]  You understand?
[01:15:36.147 --> 01:15:38.169]  And now 5G!
[01:15:38.169 --> 01:15:43.535]  When we come back, I'll explain what it's really about and why they won't let the Chi-Coms run it.
[01:15:43.535 --> 01:15:46.258]  I'm gonna explain why when we come back.
[01:15:46.258 --> 01:15:50.302]  And this is a scientific fact!
[01:15:50.302 --> 01:15:52.364]  Scientific fact!
[01:15:52.364 --> 01:15:53.746]  Ignore this at your peril!
[01:15:57.634 --> 01:15:59.595]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:15:59.595 --> 01:16:04.918]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:16:04.918 --> 01:16:06.499]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:16:06.499 --> 01:16:14.844]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:16:14.844 --> 01:16:20.548]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:16:20.708 --> 01:16:22.529]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:16:22.529 --> 01:16:24.711]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:16:24.711 --> 01:16:29.214]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:16:29.214 --> 01:16:31.395]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:16:31.395 --> 01:16:39.221]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:16:56.730 --> 01:17:01.292]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[01:17:01.292 --> 01:17:03.393]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[01:17:03.393 --> 01:17:04.714]  I had a problem like you once.
[01:17:05.114 --> 01:17:11.677]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[01:17:11.677 --> 01:17:16.739]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[01:17:16.739 --> 01:17:21.441]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[01:17:21.881 --> 01:17:25.002]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[01:17:25.002 --> 01:17:32.005]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[01:17:32.005 --> 01:17:37.188]  And if you have PPO private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.

[01:17:47.552 --> 01:17:47.872]  That's 800-506-6740.
[01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:48.412]  InfoWars.
[01:17:48.412 --> 01:17:51.633]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:18:04.272 --> 01:18:06.213]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[01:18:06.213 --> 01:18:08.694]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[01:18:08.694 --> 01:18:09.635]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[01:18:09.635 --> 01:18:10.095]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:10.095 --> 01:18:11.396]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:18:11.396 --> 01:18:13.497]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[01:18:13.497 --> 01:18:17.239]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case.
[01:18:17.239 --> 01:18:19.420]  My truck, sport, the shirts, all the equipment.
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:21.381]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[01:18:21.381 --> 01:18:22.342]  God bless you, brother.
[01:18:22.342 --> 01:18:28.965]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[01:18:29.345 --> 01:18:30.446]  You're our only hope, brother.
[01:18:30.446 --> 01:18:32.747]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[01:18:32.747 --> 01:18:35.508]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[01:18:59.036 --> 01:19:06.463]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[01:19:06.463 --> 01:19:10.727]  This is a digital, AI-enforced, gag order.
[01:19:10.727 --> 01:19:14.430]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.801]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[01:19:21.801 --> 01:19:23.021]  This is racketeering.
[01:19:23.021 --> 01:19:24.142]  This is cartels.
[01:19:24.142 --> 01:19:26.563]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:19:26.563 --> 01:19:28.424]  We need it now.
[01:19:28.424 --> 01:19:30.125]  You can take on Big Tech.
[01:19:30.125 --> 01:19:39.069]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[01:19:39.069 --> 01:19:47.112]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[01:19:47.112 --> 01:19:47.973]  The way to fight back
[01:19:48.553 --> 01:19:50.055]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:18.602 --> 01:20:26.044]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and the facts are in, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:26.044 --> 01:20:37.327]  I'm going to tell you why they're doing this slow kill, soft kill operation in a moment, but first I want to tell you the big secret, which is all hiding in plain view.
[01:20:37.327 --> 01:20:39.227]  You can search every term, everything I've said.
[01:20:39.227 --> 01:20:41.208]  I can show you a whole stack of mainstream news admitting it.
[01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:45.939]  Wired Magazine, 5G causes cancer, period.
[01:20:45.939 --> 01:20:47.400]  Hundreds of major studies.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.721]  Way worse than regular cell phone radiation.
[01:20:49.721 --> 01:20:51.221]  Why?
[01:20:51.221 --> 01:21:00.885]  Why is Trump and Australia and the UK and Facebook and all these big companies and governments and our military saying for five years no Huawei phones in our facilities?
[01:21:02.281 --> 01:21:04.381]  Why are they saying no Huawei 5G?
[01:21:04.381 --> 01:21:06.962]  Well, Huawei had already been the main 5G in the U.S.
[01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:18.984]  going in all over rural areas where they would put it in basically at cost or below it, but only in areas the Pentagon noticed around military bases.
[01:21:18.984 --> 01:21:21.965]  So let me tell you what they admit.
[01:21:21.965 --> 01:21:26.886]  With 5G, it can penetrate hardened facilities, you name it.
[01:21:26.886 --> 01:21:28.326]  It can get into unwired
[01:21:30.444 --> 01:21:36.166]  boxes and scan what is going on in the chips.
[01:21:36.166 --> 01:21:45.248]  And that's because a lot of classified things, but a lot of chips have tiny capacitors and transmitters, transceivers in them.
[01:21:45.248 --> 01:21:50.830]  And these systems can then scoop up out of the ether, pass codes, you name it.
[01:21:50.830 --> 01:21:54.211]  It's a device that goes into all the so-called smart devices.
[01:21:54.211 --> 01:21:57.012]  And big tech has been building this global architecture
[01:21:58.359 --> 01:22:01.861]  To take over the world, the internet of things, and set up this technocracy.
[01:22:01.861 --> 01:22:05.104]  It's bad.
[01:22:05.104 --> 01:22:17.773]  And so now there's a global rush and a global race who can launch the first omnipresent AI system that has this omnipresent vision through all of these nodes and all of these 5G systems.
[01:22:17.773 --> 01:22:20.314]  That's what Elon Musk talked about last year.
[01:22:20.314 --> 01:22:22.396]  Beware those who worship AI gods.
[01:22:24.687 --> 01:22:30.692]  You've now got digital police officers actually pulling cars over, robot police officers.
[01:22:30.692 --> 01:22:39.178]  This is the rollout so humans can't say no to the technocracy run by the technocrats, the rulers of the digital dictatorship.
[01:22:39.178 --> 01:22:41.880]  That's what a technocracy is, a digital dictatorship.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:53.449]  And Davos and the Club of Rome have all said, humanity's obsolete, they're gonna merge with machines, soon militaries won't matter, soon men won't matter because it'll all be automated.
[01:22:54.568 --> 01:22:58.209]  The post-human era, but I digress.
[01:22:58.209 --> 01:23:22.496]  The big thing you don't hear is this, and all you gotta do is search engine, government documents, patents, that cell phone radiation can alter human behavior, not just cause cancer, not just break DNA, and that in many studies they've been testing for more than 40 years using electromagnetic wavelength systems to change or alter moods or even kill people.
[01:23:23.911 --> 01:23:37.223]  And so our government wants to put in 5G to be able to spy on us, monitor us, track us, control us, but also change our behavior or even kill us.
[01:23:37.223 --> 01:23:39.605]  Now our government shouldn't have that power.
[01:23:39.605 --> 01:23:41.847]  And hackers shouldn't have the power to get into something like that.
[01:23:41.847 --> 01:23:42.868]  It's like the Ring of Mordor.
[01:23:42.868 --> 01:23:44.490]  It will only be used for bad.
[01:23:47.534 --> 01:23:57.978]  But imagine if the communist Chinese put in the 5G grid that can make you depressed, make you nauseous, make you angry, make you sexually excited.
[01:23:57.978 --> 01:24:02.180]  This is all declassified with 30, 40-year-old studies.
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:09.323]  This is all Associated Press, Daily Mail, Popular Science.
[01:24:09.323 --> 01:24:13.745]  What I'm telling you is admitted.
[01:24:13.745 --> 01:24:14.285]  So what do we do?
[01:24:15.532 --> 01:24:27.777]  I was looking at my 26-month-old daughter this morning, so smart, so funny, and I looked at my wife and I said, I told everybody I wanted a wired house here where everything was wires.
[01:24:27.777 --> 01:24:29.737]  I paid for it, everybody's got wireless.
[01:24:29.737 --> 01:24:34.759]  And I went and I plugged it and I said, we're not having internet until the wireless is out of here.
[01:24:34.759 --> 01:24:38.521]  Because it's always just by increment getting more and more powerful, more and more dangerous.
[01:24:38.521 --> 01:24:39.001]  And I said,
[01:24:39.977 --> 01:24:48.863]  Doesn't matter if they got Better Call Saul shows, you know, where the crazy bad lawyer brother, you know, is schizophrenic and thinks that, you know, there's radiation pollution or all this garbage.
[01:24:48.863 --> 01:24:50.604]  This is real.
[01:24:50.604 --> 01:25:03.353]  And I said to her, I said, and we've got to have a multi-year plan to get out of Austin and get to the country and then try to get people to run for office locally, to have a town somewhere that says no 5G or above.
[01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:05.470]  And that's going to be the future.
[01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:08.131]  Because let me tell you, I've got a stack of mainstream news, L.A.
[01:25:08.131 --> 01:25:23.857]  Times, where you'll have a school of a couple hundred kids, and 30 of them have got cancer, and there's a cell tower on the roof, and teachers are all dying of cancer, and getting nosebleeds, and don't know who they are.
[01:25:23.857 --> 01:25:25.678]  They've already got 5G in many areas.
[01:25:25.678 --> 01:25:28.679]  Many of these cell towers are beyond 5G.
[01:25:28.679 --> 01:25:30.220]  They've got all sorts of systems going in.
[01:25:32.162 --> 01:25:34.223]  And ladies and gentlemen, they don't want to tell you.
[01:25:34.223 --> 01:25:35.564]  They don't want you to know.
[01:25:35.564 --> 01:25:36.645]  They don't want you to be aware of it.
[01:25:36.645 --> 01:25:37.865]  But let me tell you something about radiation.
[01:25:37.865 --> 01:25:39.326]  There's lots of different types of it.
[01:25:39.326 --> 01:25:43.129]  But the sun will burn your skin if you're out in it all day until you die.
[01:25:43.129 --> 01:25:46.271]  And that stuff only penetrates maybe a quarter inch into you.
[01:25:46.271 --> 01:25:47.631]  This stuff goes right through you.
[01:25:47.631 --> 01:25:49.032]  It goes right through walls.
[01:25:49.032 --> 01:25:50.433]  It's ultra fast.
[01:25:50.433 --> 01:25:53.115]  And it's at the exact frequency to rattle DNA.
[01:25:53.115 --> 01:25:54.335]  Don't believe me?
[01:25:54.335 --> 01:25:58.518]  Type in cell phone radiation breaks DNA studies show.
[01:25:58.518 --> 01:25:59.739]  There's hundreds of those.
[01:26:00.851 --> 01:26:02.312]  Breaks your DNA.
[01:26:02.312 --> 01:26:04.012]  That means cancer.
[01:26:04.012 --> 01:26:06.573]  So here's some of the articles.
[01:26:06.573 --> 01:26:08.274]  5G smartphones cause cancer.
[01:26:08.274 --> 01:26:09.715]  Big wireless doesn't want you to know.
[01:26:09.715 --> 01:26:13.737]  Wired.
[01:26:13.737 --> 01:26:16.498]  5G services is coming and so are health concerns.
[01:26:16.498 --> 01:26:17.818]  Over the towers that support it.
[01:26:17.818 --> 01:26:20.159]  Yeah, that's the really bad one.
[01:26:20.159 --> 01:26:22.060]  The phone's bad enough.
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:24.561]  A switch to 5G may be bad for the environment.
[01:26:24.561 --> 01:26:25.882]  Newsweek even admits it.
[01:26:25.882 --> 01:26:28.423]  Plan for 5G cell phone towers raises health concerns.
[01:26:30.782 --> 01:26:33.623]  The rollout of 5G wireless services is a massive health experiment.
[01:26:33.623 --> 01:26:38.625]  Daily Mail.
[01:26:38.625 --> 01:26:40.906]  Rypon's cell tower to be removed from school grounds.
[01:26:40.906 --> 01:26:47.688]  Mothers of cancer survivors share feelings of relief and all the kids that are dead and dying.
[01:26:47.688 --> 01:26:50.609]  And it goes through it all.
[01:26:50.609 --> 01:26:56.252]  Maybe we should show some pictures of the dead and dying children from the cell tower right above the school.
[01:26:56.252 --> 01:26:57.112]  Right there.
[01:26:59.687 --> 01:27:05.551]  Here's LA Times, data shows it causes cancer.
[01:27:05.551 --> 01:27:11.254]  Protest in Albany to Europe, to Russia, want 5G out.
[01:27:11.254 --> 01:27:15.457]  People know.
[01:27:15.457 --> 01:27:17.238]  And so here's the answer.
[01:27:17.238 --> 01:27:26.344]  We oppose it, we speak out against it, and if you've bought a house and you live somewhere and you've said no and that stuff goes up, it's time to start fighting with civil disobedience.
[01:27:27.864 --> 01:27:34.968]  Because this does cause cancer, it's way more powerful than the previous radiation, and we're not going to let them.
[01:27:34.968 --> 01:27:43.533]  They want to abort our kids before they're born, they want to kill them after they're born, now they want to kill them when they're living, and if they can't do that, they want to teach them to cut their genitals off.
[01:27:43.533 --> 01:27:44.674]  That's who they are.
[01:27:44.674 --> 01:27:46.215]  It's an evil frequency.
[01:27:46.215 --> 01:27:47.675]  It's an anti-human operation.
[01:27:47.675 --> 01:27:50.417]  It's why I say it's alien.
[01:27:50.417 --> 01:27:52.538]  And I don't get into UFOs and all that stuff.
[01:27:52.538 --> 01:27:54.019]  I'm reading the Bible, folks.
[01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:55.140]  There's a fallen entity.
[01:27:56.067 --> 01:27:58.746]  That hates our guts because we were made by God, his enemy.
[01:28:00.615 --> 01:28:03.557]  And it's obsessed with rolling something out, but we have free will.
[01:28:03.557 --> 01:28:04.978]  We have to accept it.
[01:28:04.978 --> 01:28:06.779]  We have to get addicted to it.
[01:28:06.779 --> 01:28:13.042]  And everything it does is dumb us down, break up our families, give us cancer, rewire our brains, make us depressed.
[01:28:13.042 --> 01:28:14.143]  And all of us live in this.
[01:28:14.143 --> 01:28:15.384]  All of us are hypocrites.
[01:28:15.384 --> 01:28:17.805]  I'm in this quicksand with you.
[01:28:17.805 --> 01:28:19.266]  I'm in this La Brea tar pit.
[01:28:19.266 --> 01:28:22.488]  Facebook came out last week and said, we're watching you in your home.
[01:28:22.488 --> 01:28:23.528]  Watch what you say.
[01:28:23.528 --> 01:28:26.230]  Now they've announced a global government currency with the big banks.
[01:28:28.305 --> 01:28:32.107]  And they say if you don't act like they want, they'll shut you off!
[01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:33.288]  It's all here.
[01:28:33.288 --> 01:28:34.388]  It's all happening.
[01:28:34.388 --> 01:28:36.309]  It's all real.
[01:28:36.309 --> 01:28:39.691]  So why does Trump want it shut down from the Chinese?
[01:28:39.691 --> 01:28:41.672]  Not the spying, that's secondary.
[01:28:41.672 --> 01:28:44.454]  The Chinese can kill you with it.
[01:28:44.454 --> 01:28:47.716]  Not just slowly, they can kill you in days with 5G.
[01:28:47.716 --> 01:28:49.096]  In days.
[01:28:49.096 --> 01:28:49.657]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.740]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:02.662]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.662 --> 01:29:04.203]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:04.203 --> 01:29:07.164]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.164 --> 01:29:12.726]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:12.726 --> 01:29:13.926]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:13.926 --> 01:29:16.867]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:16.867 --> 01:29:19.088]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:19.088 --> 01:29:23.530]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:25.811]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:27.151 --> 01:29:31.034]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:31.034 --> 01:29:36.017]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:36.017 --> 01:29:40.841]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:40.841 --> 01:29:42.202]  Don't just take my word for it.
[01:29:42.202 --> 01:29:45.964]  Check out all of the success stories at HBExtract.com.
[01:29:45.964 --> 01:29:46.965]  Or to order, call 866-295-5305.
[01:29:46.965 --> 01:29:47.325]  That's 866-295-5305.
[01:29:47.325 --> 01:29:47.886]  HBExtract.com.
[01:29:47.886 --> 01:29:50.187]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:59.206 --> 01:30:11.238]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this, and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[01:30:11.238 --> 01:30:14.121]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving at
[01:30:14.461 --> 01:30:15.142]  I don't know.
[01:30:33.914 --> 01:30:34.874]  I like to be expanding.
[01:30:34.874 --> 01:30:35.634]  I like to be winning.
[01:30:35.634 --> 01:30:36.355]  I like to be fighting.
[01:30:36.355 --> 01:30:37.535]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[01:30:37.535 --> 01:30:38.415]  That's why we're so hated.
[01:30:38.415 --> 01:30:40.056]  But we need to be retreaded.
[01:30:40.056 --> 01:30:41.276]  We need to be tuned up.
[01:30:41.276 --> 01:30:42.316]  We need to be fixed up.
[01:30:42.316 --> 01:30:43.636]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[01:30:43.636 --> 01:30:45.177]  We got a lot of holes shot in us.
[01:30:45.177 --> 01:30:50.018]  And if the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[01:30:50.018 --> 01:30:52.018]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[01:30:52.018 --> 01:30:56.300]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor, funded by foreign banks and the Chai Kong.
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:57.680]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[01:30:58.387 --> 01:31:06.069]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:31:06.069 --> 01:31:09.850]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:31:09.850 --> 01:31:18.533]  It is you, the Infowarriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:31:18.533 --> 01:31:23.154]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:31:23.154 --> 01:31:24.595]  You are the Infowar.
[01:31:24.595 --> 01:31:28.116]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:31:28.831 --> 01:31:29.751]  We are the renaissance.
[01:31:29.751 --> 01:31:30.251]  And we are winning.
[01:31:59.116 --> 01:32:05.880]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:09.481]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[01:32:09.481 --> 01:32:11.182]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[01:32:11.182 --> 01:32:13.864]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[01:32:13.864 --> 01:32:15.344]  You're our only sponsors.
[01:32:15.344 --> 01:32:21.828]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[01:32:21.828 --> 01:32:23.749]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[01:32:24.309 --> 01:32:25.331]  I'm not the leader.
[01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:26.132]  You are the leader.
[01:32:26.132 --> 01:32:28.114]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[01:32:28.114 --> 01:32:33.522]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.
[01:32:33.522 --> 01:32:40.972]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[01:32:41.192 --> 01:32:44.315]  So I want to thank you for your support, and I want to encourage you again.
[01:32:44.315 --> 01:32:48.998]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[01:32:48.998 --> 01:32:52.141]  We have thousands of them, and it makes this all possible.
[01:32:52.141 --> 01:32:54.242]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[01:32:54.242 --> 01:33:01.368]  God bless you.
[01:33:01.368 --> 01:33:04.050]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.679 --> 01:33:25.302]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:25.302 --> 01:33:29.444]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.444 --> 01:33:46.292]  Let me just say one more thing about the rollout of all these toxic systems that are meant to reduce our population by stealth, because the system knows that we'll adapt to rising cancer rates, we'll adapt to rising infant mortality, we'll adapt to
[01:33:47.631 --> 01:33:51.552]  Lowering IQs, we'll never know what hit us with the soft kill weapon.
[01:33:51.552 --> 01:33:53.813]  Silent weapons for quiet wars.
[01:33:53.813 --> 01:33:56.034]  Here's an article out of Zero Hedge.
[01:33:56.034 --> 01:33:57.794]  A morphological adaptation.
[01:33:57.794 --> 01:34:00.935]  Smartphones now transforming the human skeleton.
[01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:02.516]  Modern life is transforming the human skeleton.
[01:34:02.516 --> 01:34:08.918]  Humans are now developing a bone spike at the back of the head caused by regularly looking down at their smartphones.
[01:34:08.918 --> 01:34:10.758]  Or a dirigible hump.
[01:34:10.758 --> 01:34:15.080]  According to a recent study, the phenomenon is called the external occipital protuberance.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:27.243]  A lump on the back of the head believed to be caused by the body reacting to the smartphone used by growing new bone layers on the back of the skull.
[01:34:27.243 --> 01:34:30.183]  Now I want to explain this again.
[01:34:30.183 --> 01:34:34.404]  What's happening is we're losing our relationships, we're losing our communication with each other.
[01:34:34.404 --> 01:34:36.865]  Young people especially, that's all the studies, look it up.
[01:34:38.487 --> 01:34:42.311]  It's causing real-time brain damage, real-time rewiring of the brain.
[01:34:42.311 --> 01:34:49.537]  That's just the manipulation of the Pavlovian flashing screen and the way it manipulates our dopamine.
[01:34:49.537 --> 01:35:02.329]  You have the former co-founder of Facebook and all these people saying, we did it immorally to manipulate you and control you so that bots would then be your friends and bots would then manipulate you, not even humans anymore.
[01:35:02.329 --> 01:35:04.011]  But the avatars you believe are humans.
[01:35:05.543 --> 01:35:12.791]  And that's how they maneuver leftists into being so vicious, so crazed, such maniacs, because they're mainly living online.
[01:35:12.791 --> 01:35:16.335]  In closing, it's the old parable of the vampire.
[01:35:16.335 --> 01:35:19.618]  Vampires aren't real, but the archetype is real.
[01:35:19.618 --> 01:35:21.220]  You have to invite evil in.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:24.243]  You have to go buy the cell phone.
[01:35:24.243 --> 01:35:27.767]  You have to bring it into your home.
[01:35:29.175 --> 01:35:42.307]  You have to learn to look into its eyes when it says, come here, and give it your worship, and give it your time, and it bings and it buzzes like Pavlov's bell to the dog, and before you know it, you are entranced.
[01:35:42.307 --> 01:35:43.028]  You are entranced.
[01:35:43.028 --> 01:35:45.210]  People aren't having sex anymore because of Netflix.
[01:35:45.210 --> 01:35:49.995]  People aren't having babies anymore because of Netflix, the study show, because of their smartphones, because it's their whole world!
[01:35:50.725 --> 01:36:00.629]  You try to talk to someone particularly mesmerized by it, they'll look at you angrily because you can't deliver the dopamine, the instant manipulation that it can.
[01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:01.690]  You're pulling me away.
[01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:04.311]  You're associated with depression.
[01:36:04.311 --> 01:36:07.392]  You're associated with not being a good person.
[01:36:07.392 --> 01:36:10.473]  You're associated with taking them out of the matrix.
[01:36:10.473 --> 01:36:14.475]  They want to be back in the matrix, but slowly in the matrix, they're being destroyed.
[01:36:16.892 --> 01:36:18.893]  That's what the studies show.
[01:36:18.893 --> 01:36:24.757]  So Trump knows that 5G and all the studies is able to manipulate human behavior.
[01:36:24.757 --> 01:36:26.758]  They don't want the Chinese to have access to that.
[01:36:26.758 --> 01:36:29.439]  Well, our government shouldn't have that.
[01:36:29.439 --> 01:36:34.382]  And so I'm glad to see movements and lawsuits and people saying no to 5G because of what we know it's doing.
[01:36:34.382 --> 01:36:36.123]  The other stuff's been deadly.
[01:36:36.123 --> 01:36:37.424]  So why would they ratchet it up?
[01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:39.465]  Why would our government do something like that?
[01:36:39.465 --> 01:36:43.388]  Why would systems bring things in like this that they know hurts us?
[01:36:44.943 --> 01:36:53.832]  Well, there's some letters that have been found between French and British kings where they talk about, oh cousin, I've had an uprising.
[01:36:53.832 --> 01:36:54.933]  Oh, I'm married to your sister.
[01:36:54.933 --> 01:36:55.894]  Oh, I'm married to your cousin.
[01:36:55.894 --> 01:36:58.176]  They're the same family.
[01:36:58.176 --> 01:37:00.879]  It's time to have a war.
[01:37:00.879 --> 01:37:02.561]  And so they'd kill off a bunch of people in a war.
[01:37:02.561 --> 01:37:05.503]  Well, you're killing off some of your strongest men, so they won't oppose you.
[01:37:06.288 --> 01:37:09.009]  But what about hurting the DNA of everybody?
[01:37:09.009 --> 01:37:12.551]  What about dumbing everybody down and breaking up the family and the human system?
[01:37:12.551 --> 01:37:14.031]  Well, that's the decision that's been made.
[01:37:14.031 --> 01:37:22.014]  The decision that's been made that we're a cancer by our leaders, whoever's directing them, and we're entering a post-human era.
[01:37:22.014 --> 01:37:24.175]  And so I want to have a pro-human era.
[01:37:24.175 --> 01:37:26.056]  And I want to see space exploration.
[01:37:26.056 --> 01:37:28.437]  And I want to see us transcend this planet.
[01:37:29.462 --> 01:37:31.844]  But the decision's been made that that's not going to happen.
[01:37:31.844 --> 01:37:34.185]  And Elon Musk and others have been inside the boardrooms.
[01:37:34.185 --> 01:37:35.226]  So has Bill Joy.
[01:37:35.226 --> 01:37:44.053]  They've told you that you'll have several hundred top tech people, billionaires all, and they agree they have votes on this program.
[01:37:44.053 --> 01:37:47.095]  They have votes on the global program of world population reduction.
[01:37:48.479 --> 01:37:54.724]  By any means necessary, the sterilization, the dumbing down, and if you look at what they're mainly attacking, it's not the third world.
[01:37:54.724 --> 01:37:58.727]  The truth is the globalists are threatened just like kings were of their best men.
[01:37:58.727 --> 01:38:04.531]  It's focusing on the highest IQs, the most aggressive and smart populations.
[01:38:04.531 --> 01:38:16.080]  It is a parallel to a grizzly bear male that's drawn to have sex with a female bear and
[01:38:18.100 --> 01:38:19.721]  What's the technical sign of a female bear?
[01:38:19.721 --> 01:38:21.463]  Look that up for me.
[01:38:21.463 --> 01:38:22.604]  A sow?
[01:38:22.604 --> 01:38:24.025]  I forget.
[01:38:24.025 --> 01:38:25.946]  But she's got her cubs.
[01:38:25.946 --> 01:38:26.687]  What's the male called?
[01:38:26.687 --> 01:38:28.208]  A bull?
[01:38:28.208 --> 01:38:29.289]  I'm going from memory here.
[01:38:29.289 --> 01:38:31.411]  I know a female fox is a vixen.
[01:38:31.411 --> 01:38:35.234]  They've got all these weird names for male this, female that in the animal kingdom.
[01:38:35.234 --> 01:38:42.019]  But even though it's his cub, if it's a male, he'll try to kill it.
[01:38:42.019 --> 01:38:43.020]  And that's what the globalists are doing.
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.242]  They're trying to kill the best.
[01:38:45.242 --> 01:38:46.423]  That's the secret of eugenics.
[01:38:47.654 --> 01:38:50.596]  They're not threatened by people that aren't that high IQ.
[01:38:50.596 --> 01:38:55.100]  They're threatened by people that are, because they see them as pretenders to the power.
[01:38:55.100 --> 01:39:01.005]  And that's what this is, this global infanticide.
[01:39:01.005 --> 01:39:04.228]  Male bears are called boars.
[01:39:04.228 --> 01:39:08.471]  Did I get it right?
[01:39:08.471 --> 01:39:09.552]  And then she's called a sow.
[01:39:09.552 --> 01:39:10.153]  I didn't get it right.
[01:39:10.153 --> 01:39:11.073]  Wow.
[01:39:11.073 --> 01:39:11.794]  Did I?
[01:39:11.794 --> 01:39:13.035]  Wow.
[01:39:13.035 --> 01:39:14.676]  Okay.
[01:39:14.676 --> 01:39:16.258]  What is a group of crows called?
[01:39:17.122 --> 01:39:17.763]  A gaggle.
[01:39:17.763 --> 01:39:19.304]  What's a really big group of crows called?
[01:39:19.304 --> 01:39:20.045]  A murder.
[01:39:20.045 --> 01:39:25.791]  I read a book once that had all the old English names for things, and it gets really wild.
[01:39:25.791 --> 01:39:27.794]  A male fox is called a dog.
[01:39:27.794 --> 01:39:30.276]  The females a vixen.
[01:39:30.276 --> 01:39:31.858]  Anyways, I digress.
[01:39:31.858 --> 01:39:36.183]  Shifting gears out of that, we're about to go to Robert Barnes with big updates on the First Amendment battles here in a moment.
[01:39:36.183 --> 01:39:38.806]  First off, again, please do not forget.
[01:39:39.864 --> 01:39:43.709]  That they're in the news trying to frame me with child porn.
[01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:52.138]  And when I say somebody who said they're mad at me for covering Sandy Hook sent me hidden child porn that I never opened, the National News now says I'm sending child porn around.
[01:39:52.138 --> 01:39:55.202]  And then they say, oh, and you're calling a lawyer the person responsible.
[01:39:55.202 --> 01:39:55.682]  No, I didn't.
[01:39:56.693 --> 01:39:59.194]  I said their whole canard is what's triggered this.
[01:39:59.194 --> 01:40:01.615]  So now I've been sanctioned and all this.
[01:40:01.615 --> 01:40:04.417]  It just shows how corrupt this whole thing is.
[01:40:04.417 --> 01:40:05.737]  But we're going to continue on.
[01:40:05.737 --> 01:40:09.459]  We're under attack because we're covering the global government.
[01:40:09.459 --> 01:40:10.660]  We're covering the 5G.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:13.981]  We're covering all the key systems of this program.
[01:40:13.981 --> 01:40:18.243]  So please don't forget we have all of the best-selling products, period.
[01:40:18.243 --> 01:40:23.406]  All the supplements, all the best systems at InfoWareStore.com, the same InfoWare specials.
[01:40:25.271 --> 01:40:28.614]  50% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points.
[01:40:28.614 --> 01:40:37.981]  Store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50% off, as big a sale as we ever do, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:37.981 --> 01:40:44.526]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support, but now is time to sign up for AutoShip, an additional 10% off on your next order.
[01:40:44.526 --> 01:40:48.649]  Again, sign up every 15 days, every month, every two months, every three months, out to nine months.

[01:40:55.789 --> 01:41:00.131]  Not just with the Patriot points, but an additional 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:41:00.131 --> 01:41:01.852]  Never can we top a deal like this.
[01:41:01.852 --> 01:41:05.833]  We're cutting this down to where we're making 10, 15% on these products.
[01:41:05.833 --> 01:41:07.754]  Some of these are lost leaders.
[01:41:07.754 --> 01:41:17.518]  If you do things like the AutoShip, the best fluoride-free toothpaste with all the key healthy things like iodine, the coiled silver fortified in it, super blue, and the mouthwash, the eight-pack PowerStack,
[01:41:18.198 --> 01:41:23.560]  How Trump won film, all the new t-shirts, so much more at infowarestore.com.
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:24.400]  Okay, we're about to go to break.
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:25.820]  I'm here with Robert Barnes.
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:37.884]  Bob, so much has happened, and I know you're going to have some updates for us on the other side, but first off, they're still running AP articles saying that I lost a lawsuit and that I wrote a book I didn't write.
[01:41:37.884 --> 01:41:39.305]  It's still the front of Twitter.
[01:41:39.305 --> 01:41:40.545]  That means this must be on purpose.
[01:41:42.191 --> 01:41:42.611]  No doubt.
[01:41:42.611 --> 01:41:45.093]  I mean, the Market Watch is involved with that.
[01:41:45.093 --> 01:41:47.594]  The AP at one time was involved with that.
[01:41:47.594 --> 01:41:48.874]  They clearly know it's false.
[01:41:48.874 --> 01:41:50.355]  They've been told it's false.
[01:41:50.355 --> 01:41:58.459]  They have not, but yet still, there has been a failure to issue corrections and issue retractions by a wide range of people.
[01:41:58.459 --> 01:42:01.561]  There's many that have, but there's many that have not.
[01:42:01.561 --> 01:42:02.741]  And it's clearly deliberate.
[01:42:02.741 --> 01:42:03.481]  It's clearly intentional.
[01:42:03.481 --> 01:42:10.605]  It goes back to about, you know, I think about a year ago, where there was some random crime on some California or Texas highway.
[01:42:11.152 --> 01:42:13.155]  And they stuck your face on the photo.
[01:42:13.155 --> 01:42:19.823]  I mean, they stuck your photo on a news story that has nothing to do with you whatsoever, in terms of this other lawsuit out of Wisconsin.
[01:42:19.823 --> 01:42:21.205]  They're definitely testing.
[01:42:21.205 --> 01:42:22.146]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:42:22.146 --> 01:42:23.908]  Somebody attacked the police on the road.
[01:42:23.908 --> 01:42:24.990]  They just said it was Alex Jones!
[01:42:26.238 --> 01:42:27.179]  Exactly.
[01:42:27.179 --> 01:42:30.661]  So they put that up there then, and now they've done it again.
[01:42:30.661 --> 01:42:32.862]  Some of the headlines actually falsely list your name.
[01:42:32.862 --> 01:42:33.822]  They claim you wrote a book.
[01:42:33.822 --> 01:42:35.083]  You had nothing to do with it.
[01:42:35.083 --> 01:42:42.887]  There have been so many Sandy Hook lies told by the media in this context, but the biggest ones have been told about you and against you.
[01:42:42.887 --> 01:42:49.591]  And that's what's ultimately going to get exposed in the lawsuits that we're going to have to bring, and we're going to have to help create an organization.
[01:42:49.591 --> 01:42:50.151]  Stay there.
[01:42:50.151 --> 01:42:50.491]  Exactly.
[01:42:50.491 --> 01:42:52.772]  Let's talk about why they're so bold right now.
[01:42:52.772 --> 01:42:54.894]  I think it's signals they're about to make a move on Trump.
[01:42:54.894 --> 01:42:55.394]  Stay with us.

[01:43:44.571 --> 01:43:46.092]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:43:46.092 --> 01:43:47.573]  It lasts 10 hours.

[01:44:59.075 --> 01:45:03.238]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:45:03.238 --> 01:45:13.645]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[01:45:13.645 --> 01:45:18.108]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[01:45:18.468 --> 01:45:33.098]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting InfoWars.
[01:45:33.098 --> 01:45:48.148]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose
[01:45:48.288 --> 01:45:48.769]  We're good to go.
[01:45:58.903 --> 01:46:01.484]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[01:46:01.484 --> 01:46:09.368]  We're going into the season of war, and they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[01:46:09.368 --> 01:46:13.029]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[01:46:13.029 --> 01:46:13.950]  We need to end here.
[01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:15.270]  We need to be provisioned.
[01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:18.712]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against
[01:46:18.712 --> 01:46:22.954]  I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds, I need gas, I need ammo politically now!
[01:46:36.701 --> 01:46:44.106]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[01:46:44.106 --> 01:46:45.527]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[01:46:45.527 --> 01:46:52.552]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[01:46:52.552 --> 01:46:53.533]  You have my commitment.
[01:46:53.533 --> 01:47:01.358]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[01:47:01.358 --> 01:47:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.097 --> 01:47:26.959]  We can add somebody else to the Clinton body count, it appears.
[01:47:26.959 --> 01:47:38.385]  GatewayPundit.com reports, corrupt Clinton Foundation foreign policy director, Dacia, appears to have vanished.
[01:47:38.385 --> 01:47:42.987]  Meanwhile, NBC News reports, Clinton covered up, had a foul ring at the State Department.
[01:47:42.987 --> 01:47:45.688]  It's all starting to break.
[01:47:45.688 --> 01:47:51.051]  And in the next film, cult trial, we learn there was devil worship.
[01:47:51.051 --> 01:47:52.692]  Children trafficked and disappearing.
[01:47:54.168 --> 01:47:57.529]  Oh, and the Clintons were involved.
[01:47:57.529 --> 01:48:00.730]  Blackmailing people involved.
[01:48:00.730 --> 01:48:06.011]  Any direction the Clintons go, there's aircraft and small children disappearing.
[01:48:06.011 --> 01:48:15.333]  But don't worry, if you talk bad about them, they'll have the front page of Twitter for two days now say Alex Jones is a pedophile.
[01:48:15.333 --> 01:48:19.514]  And that I wrote a book about Sandy Hook not happening and I lost a suit.
[01:48:19.514 --> 01:48:20.134]  None of it's true.
[01:48:21.776 --> 01:48:24.857]  And not as if you search Alex Jones, it's the top thing.
[01:48:24.857 --> 01:48:28.298]  Yesterday it was the top link.
[01:48:28.298 --> 01:48:36.401]  And again, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, represents Covington kids, represents famous Hollywood folks, represents billionaires.
[01:48:36.401 --> 01:48:42.882]  He's an admitted top litigator, courthouse, junkyard dog, killer of giants.
[01:48:42.882 --> 01:48:44.223]  And he says he's never seen anything like it.
[01:48:44.223 --> 01:48:45.443]  I was talking to him last night.
[01:48:45.443 --> 01:48:47.204]  He called high-level AP people and they said,
[01:48:48.422 --> 01:48:51.505]  Well, I'll tell you what he wants to tell you, they said.
[01:48:51.505 --> 01:48:53.027]  Again, this is bigger than us, Bob.
[01:48:53.027 --> 01:48:58.032]  I've never seen something of this magnitude, but we know what it is.
[01:48:58.032 --> 01:49:02.897]  Obama legalized the CIA engaging in domestic propaganda, the Washington Post reported.
[01:49:04.056 --> 01:49:14.480]  ForeignPolicy.com, the foreign policy journal of the Washington Post, basically a CFR paper, and they admit we're lying to you and we're putting out this info inside the U.S.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:17.341]  and it's still going on and Trump hasn't stopped it.
[01:49:17.341 --> 01:49:20.162]  What do you think this is, a test?
[01:49:20.162 --> 01:49:22.923]  What is this, Bob?
[01:49:22.923 --> 01:49:25.063]  I mean, it's an onslaught.
[01:49:25.063 --> 01:49:29.645]  In part, it's a reflection of the fact that they are losing the battle at multiple levels.
[01:49:29.645 --> 01:49:32.886]  So the fact that the audience has not gone away, the audience has
[01:49:33.337 --> 01:49:53.085]  Stayed with the audience, has continued to contribute, has continued to be involved, has continued to buy product and support InfoWars, make sure InfoWars can stay afloat, despite this unprecedented onslaught and attack, clearly has agitated those who are against you and want to see you destroyed.
[01:49:53.085 --> 01:49:56.306]  They thought the lawsuits would achieve that objective, they did not.
[01:49:56.306 --> 01:50:01.228]  They thought the various PR and press attacks would achieve that objective, they have not.
[01:50:01.670 --> 01:50:04.873]  They thought the politicians calling for you to be banned would achieve that.
[01:50:04.873 --> 01:50:05.834]  It has not.
[01:50:05.834 --> 01:50:10.818]  They thought that deplatforming by Twitter and by YouTube and by Google would have that effect.
[01:50:10.818 --> 01:50:11.799]  It did not.
[01:50:11.799 --> 01:50:18.384]  They thought that Facebook and Instagram banning the use of even your name and a favorable positive light would have that effect.
[01:50:18.384 --> 01:50:19.245]  It did not.
[01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:22.868]  They have been unable to defeat the InfoWars audience.
[01:50:22.868 --> 01:50:28.393]  And that frustration and that exasperation with their inability to achieve their objective
[01:50:28.846 --> 01:50:41.255]  Also to take out the President at the same time, in terms of all of the coup attempts effectively that were being waged by the rogue Mueller investigation, when that ultimately shut down and was shut down by Attorney General Barr.
[01:50:41.255 --> 01:50:57.826]  The combined effect of seeing the President continue to achieve and attain success, continue to be in a good position to win 2020, while continuing to see the InfoWars audience support you and support itself by being involved in... So you're saying we're seeing a massive temper tantrum?
[01:50:58.891 --> 01:50:59.551]  Exactly.
[01:50:59.551 --> 01:51:01.552]  A temper tantrum of unparalleled proportion.
[01:51:01.552 --> 01:51:05.273]  The things they accuse you of are things that they themselves are doing.
[01:51:05.273 --> 01:51:12.955]  And this is a consistent and continuous pattern of the press and the politicians and your political adversaries making things up.
[01:51:12.955 --> 01:51:19.917]  It starts with a motion filed in court where they say lawyers said things that the lawyers never said.
[01:51:19.917 --> 01:51:21.978]  The lawyers were careful in what they said.
[01:51:21.978 --> 01:51:25.159]  The lawyers never said any of the things that were in the headline.
[01:51:25.159 --> 01:51:28.100]  Then you have a verdict from another case in Wisconsin
[01:51:28.581 --> 01:51:31.302]  That has absolutely nothing to do with you whatsoever.
[01:51:31.302 --> 01:51:35.602]  Initially, they libel by just sticking your photo in, but not mentioning you by name.
[01:51:35.602 --> 01:51:43.944]  And then some idiot editor at the Associated Press and Market Watch and these other places says, oh, that photo is Alex Jones, so the lawsuit must be about Alex Jones.
[01:51:43.944 --> 01:51:45.644]  Even the news story never was.
[01:51:45.644 --> 01:51:47.625]  And this is editors who are doing this.
[01:51:47.625 --> 01:51:55.746]  So, I mean, I've talked to a reporter at the Associated Press who didn't know how in the world this story happened and was trying to find ways to track it down and fix it.
[01:51:55.746 --> 01:51:58.427]  Many of these stories have no reporter's name attached.
[01:51:58.939 --> 01:52:03.327]  So that means they took the story from someone else, and it's editors who are doing this.
[01:52:03.327 --> 01:52:04.629]  It's the people at the top.
[01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:05.150]  Oh, we know.
[01:52:05.150 --> 01:52:07.273]  This has CIA written all over it.
[01:52:08.151 --> 01:52:32.268]  That's exactly who goes in and Operation Mockingbird in the group Obama set up is shadowy unnamed editors just put out fake news and they think people are so stupid they say I've lost a suit so they can probably use that against banks and say oh look he's insolvent when I'm not and I wrote a book about kids and I'm sending out child porn none of which was said in court none of which is true all of which is made up this is next level which again it's not about me.
[01:52:32.708 --> 01:52:34.309]  Sure, they're scared of the populist audience.
[01:52:34.309 --> 01:52:35.250]  That's what they're really scared of.
[01:52:35.250 --> 01:52:35.510]  It's true.
[01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:36.891]  I'm not building the audience up.
[01:52:36.891 --> 01:52:39.713]  They admit in their own internal documents that they've gone public.
[01:52:39.713 --> 01:52:41.895]  But we're a focal point, a gathering spot.
[01:52:41.895 --> 01:52:44.197]  But it means they're about to make a move on Trump.
[01:52:44.197 --> 01:52:55.845]  I really think them saying that he attacked Russia when he didn't, and all this other crap, and the attempt, you know, with the ship, I think that this is really signifies they're getting ready to do something.
[01:52:55.845 --> 01:52:57.446]  Well, they're clearly accelerating.
[01:52:57.446 --> 01:53:02.130]  So there's the accelerated, they failed to get any of the impeachment investigation talk stuff going.
[01:53:02.591 --> 01:53:07.313]  They failed to be able to get the Mueller report to lead to anything consequential or impactful.
[01:53:07.313 --> 01:53:12.174]  They know that impeachment actually motivates more of Trump's base than motivates their opposition.
[01:53:12.174 --> 01:53:27.019]  And so all of this sort of rhetoric, I mean, they were originally greenlighting violence and the sort of cultural celebration from the play in Broadway that was just shown here, to the play in New York, to later on with Snoop Dogg doing something similar.
[01:53:27.403 --> 01:53:33.245]  So they're trying to create an environment that would justify someone acting violently against the president.
[01:53:33.245 --> 01:53:42.149]  You saw this sort of a welcoming of milkshaking, quote-unquote, which was physical assaults on people in the United Kingdom, hoping that that would translate here.
[01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:47.291]  Here they're trying to accelerate the allegations against you that they know are completely and utterly false.
[01:53:47.291 --> 01:53:53.133]  They're going to create a wide range of potential libel claims against some of the biggest members of the institutional press in the world.
[01:53:53.883 --> 01:53:59.907]  And that usually parallels and precedes an attack on the president.
[01:53:59.907 --> 01:54:04.330]  And it would be logical for them to do so from the perspective that everything they've thrown at him has failed.
[01:54:04.330 --> 01:54:07.132]  And yesterday he launches his political rally in Orlando.
[01:54:07.132 --> 01:54:09.213]  It goes incredibly successfully.
[01:54:09.213 --> 01:54:10.734]  It has a huge crowd.
[01:54:10.734 --> 01:54:12.695]  That is a long line outside of it.
[01:54:12.695 --> 01:54:20.000]  CNN is so affected by the success of the presentation that they shut down the broadcast six minutes into it.
[01:54:20.441 --> 01:54:33.030]  So you have this dynamic of the populist revolution, the humanitarian revolution succeeding, and all of a sudden you get these escalating talks that are encouraging a war with Iran.
[01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:37.193]  Escalating talks before that are trying to encourage a war with Venezuela.
[01:54:37.193 --> 01:54:40.716]  Escalating talks trying to encourage a conflict with Russia.
[01:54:41.286 --> 01:54:49.252]  And this parallels the unprecedented assault on Infowars and you based on complete lies and libels that they know are lies and libels.
[01:54:49.252 --> 01:54:54.376]  So whatever is happening to you is usually a beginning.
[01:54:54.376 --> 01:54:57.939]  It's a foreshadowing of what they're going to do to the President.
[01:54:57.939 --> 01:54:59.860]  So the President needs to be awake and alert.
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:00.901]  All of this also happens
[01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:08.683]  After Attorney General Barr not only shut down the Mueller investigation, but green-light an antitrust investigation into Big Tech.
[01:55:08.683 --> 01:55:19.127]  Today, Senator Hawley introduced legislation for the first time in the United States Senate that would call for ending Big Tech's special immunities for their censorship activity.
[01:55:19.127 --> 01:55:27.530]  That Section 230 would be modified and changed and not allow them to do what they're doing today, where Twitter is promoting articles that they know are lies and libels about
[01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:32.073]  That they're only able to get away with it as a platform because they pretend they're not a publisher.
[01:55:47.526 --> 01:55:53.073]  Either they're going to be destroyed or we're going to be overthrown and we're going to be shut down so it won't matter what they did.
[01:55:53.073 --> 01:55:56.236]  They are acting in a desperate, scorched earth policy.
[01:55:56.236 --> 01:55:58.179]  Now I want to say one thing critical to the viewers.
[01:56:00.202 --> 01:56:06.525]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[01:56:06.525 --> 01:56:18.389]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here, from the bottom of my heart, to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people, that you knew they were liars.
[01:56:18.389 --> 01:56:20.510]  You went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:26.093]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart.
[01:56:26.093 --> 01:56:28.934]  I want you to know that love is right back at you, and I want to thank you
[01:56:30.208 --> 01:56:36.851]  For all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support, because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[01:56:36.851 --> 01:56:41.313]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and it's not going to be fun.
[01:56:41.313 --> 01:56:42.714]  But that's not what's important.
[01:56:42.714 --> 01:56:44.215]  The enemy could win.
[01:56:44.215 --> 01:56:46.956]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[01:56:46.956 --> 01:56:48.177]  We're being used by God.
[01:56:48.177 --> 01:56:49.417]  You're being used by God.
[01:56:49.417 --> 01:56:50.558]  This is providence.
[01:56:50.558 --> 01:56:55.560]  So I salute you, and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:56.601]  Bob, we're going to break.
[01:56:56.601 --> 01:56:58.081]  You can come back with us some next hour.
[01:56:58.081 --> 01:56:59.342]  What are other things on your radar?
[01:57:00.976 --> 01:57:06.124]  So I think in general you're looking at, for example, what happened in the Connecticut court case.
[01:57:06.124 --> 01:57:11.513]  You're seeing judges issue rulings that say they're controlling over their ability to control a party.
[01:57:11.892 --> 01:57:15.154]  Means they have a right to suppress or punish their First Amendment speech.
[01:57:15.154 --> 01:57:18.955]  That's disconcerting, but we're going to bring that up to the constitutional structure.
[01:57:18.955 --> 01:57:24.918]  And what you also mentioned is the dystopian future that the combination of deplatforming and defamation create.
[01:57:24.918 --> 01:57:40.065]  And that is that here they're able to lie and libel you and you have no ability and no means to make a personal defense on the very platforms and against the very publications that are lying and libeling you because they have completely removed you from the ability to do so.
[01:57:40.385 --> 01:57:42.726]  This is the future they want to create for all Americans.
[01:57:42.726 --> 01:57:43.306]  That's right.
[01:57:43.306 --> 01:57:43.866]  Absolutely.
[01:57:43.866 --> 01:57:44.566]  This is critical.
[01:57:44.566 --> 01:57:47.627]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.627 --> 01:57:49.508]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget.
[01:57:49.508 --> 01:57:50.768]  This is the maximum alert.
[01:57:50.768 --> 01:57:51.909]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[01:57:51.909 --> 01:57:53.329]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[01:57:53.329 --> 01:57:59.611]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight, but we need financial support, and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:59.611 --> 01:58:01.432]  You want to just give us straight donations.
[01:58:01.432 --> 01:58:02.032]  There's a P.O.

[01:58:03.272 --> 01:58:05.073]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[01:58:05.073 --> 01:58:08.094]  We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action.
[01:58:08.234 --> 01:58:08.434]  We're good.
[01:58:27.737 --> 01:58:31.479]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[01:58:31.479 --> 01:58:32.300]  We're not going to back down.

[01:59:51.369 --> 01:59:54.011]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.629 --> 02:00:10.470]  You found it.
[02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:12.790]  The kryptonite's a globalist.
[02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:15.271]  Whatever it is we're doing, they don't like it.
[02:00:15.271 --> 02:00:18.451]  I haven't aired one of the local newscasts or all the national newscasts lying about us.
[02:00:18.451 --> 02:00:19.572]  It's one thing to look at the news articles.
[02:00:19.572 --> 02:00:22.792]  It's another thing to watch people attack you and lie about you.
[02:00:22.792 --> 02:00:29.694]  But the judge up there in Connecticut, we'll talk about her some because it's bigger than Infowars.
[02:00:31.141 --> 02:00:34.205]  And does she not understand how the internet works?
[02:00:34.205 --> 02:00:35.226]  Or what's going on?
[02:00:35.226 --> 02:00:47.900]  We're going to play some of that newscast next segment, but you talk about the Connecticut Post, that's very unrespected, you know, a known kind of rag, like the Inquirers, like the high mark compared to them.
[02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:50.623]  Judge sanctions Alex Jones for child porn frame.
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:53.041]  Claim.
[02:00:53.041 --> 02:00:55.582]  So, and I guess that is what the judge said.
[02:00:55.582 --> 02:00:58.844]  Like, that's why we're appealing it.
[02:00:58.844 --> 02:01:01.005]  In her letting the suit go forward, basically, is what's happened.
[02:01:01.005 --> 02:01:02.406]  We were even challenging it to throw it out.
[02:01:02.406 --> 02:01:05.367]  We still have another chance, obviously, several to throw it out.
[02:01:05.367 --> 02:01:12.471]  But she is saying you shouldn't question that anybody... We were sent this by people death-threatening us.
[02:01:12.471 --> 02:01:15.212]  We're getting it all from the FBI.
[02:01:15.212 --> 02:01:16.113]  They said we were the victim.
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:20.653]  I'm saying I'm being set up, so they say that I'm saying Chris Maddy set me up.
[02:01:20.653 --> 02:01:21.878]  No, I'm not saying that.
[02:01:23.427 --> 02:01:26.489]  I'm saying Chris Maddy, I believe, went to the FBI to try to get me arrested.
[02:01:26.489 --> 02:01:27.570]  They basically admit that now.
[02:01:27.570 --> 02:01:30.393]  They say it's illegal that I transmitted child porn.
[02:01:30.393 --> 02:01:33.015]  No, somebody sent me unopened emails.
[02:01:33.015 --> 02:01:34.936]  They went and asked for all our Sandy Hook emails.
[02:01:34.936 --> 02:01:37.318]  It was buried, hidden in a Sandy Hook email.
[02:01:37.318 --> 02:01:38.419]  Hidden links.
[02:01:38.419 --> 02:01:39.880]  And then I'm supposed to be the bad guy.
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:41.481]  Of course I'm pissed off.
[02:01:41.481 --> 02:01:46.185]  And then these articles come out, you know, saying that I've transmitted child porn.
[02:01:46.185 --> 02:01:49.868]  And then Maddy goes out and does a press conference that goes along with it.
[02:01:49.868 --> 02:01:51.890]  So it's just unbelievable, Bob.
[02:01:53.154 --> 02:01:54.294]  Well, precisely.
[02:01:54.294 --> 02:02:11.021]  The big issue here is you have courts and lawyers advocating for a position that says that there's an exception to the First Amendment if you're a party to a lawsuit, and that there's a special safe space for lawyers, which I find sort of ludicrous.
[02:02:11.618 --> 02:02:20.904]  The idea of being a lawyer in a case does not entitle you to be immune from criticism, even harsh criticism.
[02:02:20.904 --> 02:02:22.345]  That goes with the territory.
[02:02:22.345 --> 02:02:30.490]  But to be clear, my main criticism was whoever tried to frame me with the child porn, and then I said, and this whole gaggle's trying to bring me down, me thinks they protest too much.
[02:02:30.490 --> 02:02:36.574]  I did not say Chris Maddy was who sent it to me, but then the media said it was him, and now he's bought into that narrative as the victim.
[02:02:38.117 --> 02:02:38.898]  Correct, yes.
[02:02:38.898 --> 02:02:45.004]  And I think, independent of... I think the judge got things wrong here about what took place and what transpired.
[02:02:45.004 --> 02:02:51.251]  But putting aside that she, I think, got the facts wrong, I think that the facts show that there wasn't any attempts to... Yeah, no, take your time.
[02:02:51.251 --> 02:02:52.252]  We've got next segment, too.
[02:02:52.252 --> 02:02:53.313]  So, I mean, walk through that.
[02:02:53.313 --> 02:02:54.815]  It's interesting.
[02:02:54.815 --> 02:02:55.395]  Absolutely.
[02:02:55.395 --> 02:02:59.980]  So, I mean, the underlying facts are different than what the judge apparently concluded.
[02:03:00.498 --> 02:03:11.507]  In the sense that the criticism was focused on whoever it was who was sending these malware attacks, sending these child porn embedded attacks on InfoWars.
[02:03:11.507 --> 02:03:12.908]  That was where the criticism was.
[02:03:12.908 --> 02:03:15.431]  That's where the anger was expressed for.
[02:03:15.431 --> 02:03:20.975]  And there was some confusion, deliberate confusion, on behalf of the press to try to confuse that.
[02:03:20.975 --> 02:03:28.862]  But independent of that, as a general matter, as a universal matter, no court should ever use its power
[02:03:29.318 --> 02:03:37.000]  To sanction a person for speech that occurred outside of court when there's not even a constitutionally imposed gag order in play.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.001]  And in general, most gag orders are unconstitutional.
[02:03:40.001 --> 02:03:42.602]  That's why courts now don't issue them.
[02:03:42.602 --> 02:03:51.024]  They cannot circumvent that constitutional requirement by imposing punishment on people for questioning or critiquing the other side.
[02:03:51.024 --> 02:03:57.906]  Even if the judge got the facts wrong, even if the judge was right about the fact, it is very dangerous.
[02:03:58.311 --> 02:04:06.178]  for courts to use its extraordinary power over litigant and parties to a case to punish them for their speech.
[02:04:06.178 --> 02:04:08.199]  That's just wrong, period.
[02:04:08.199 --> 02:04:14.865]  Pettis thinks that, Pettis, obviously the case of Connecticut, he thinks even in Connecticut being very liberal that the courts are going to overturn this.
[02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:17.681]  Yes, they have to.
[02:04:17.681 --> 02:04:19.402]  There's simply no precedent for this.
[02:04:19.402 --> 02:04:31.427]  There is no precedent where a court has been allowed to sanction someone for their out-of-court... Well, Pattis claims there's a case where somebody outside sent something to a party who was a woman, and that that intimidated her.
[02:04:31.427 --> 02:04:31.868]  But, I mean...
[02:04:33.086 --> 02:04:34.588]  That's called fighting work.
[02:04:34.588 --> 02:04:40.334]  So if you have imminent lawless action, where you're in the physical presence of someone, then that's a different dynamic.
[02:04:40.334 --> 02:04:41.555]  That isn't what happened here at all.
[02:04:41.555 --> 02:04:44.999]  Even by the judge's misunderstanding of the facts, that's not what happened.
[02:04:44.999 --> 02:04:52.707]  So if courts start misusing their power to censor, suppress, or punish people for their speech, we're in a dangerous position in our country.
[02:04:52.707 --> 02:04:53.628]  Let's talk about this.
[02:04:53.628 --> 02:04:54.950]  Is it a dangerous power grab?
[02:04:56.192 --> 02:05:05.500]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:08.343]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:05:08.343 --> 02:05:14.409]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out of the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:21.332]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:05:21.332 --> 02:05:27.596]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:05:27.596 --> 02:05:34.559]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:48.734]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:05:48.734 --> 02:05:52.978]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:05:52.978 --> 02:05:55.681]  X3, now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:13.354 --> 02:06:18.317]  From the front lines of the Information War!
[02:06:18.317 --> 02:06:19.718]  Woo!
[02:06:19.718 --> 02:06:21.819]  Sworn to avenge!
[02:06:21.819 --> 02:06:23.180]  On them to hell!
[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:30.204]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:30.204 --> 02:06:33.867]  A gleam in their eyes, as the ships closed.
[02:06:33.867 --> 02:06:41.551]  Every man, excited to get some action.
[02:06:41.551 --> 02:06:42.192]  Feel the ships.
[02:06:43.746 --> 02:06:45.508]  Barreling over the sea.
[02:06:45.508 --> 02:06:47.150]  Closing.
[02:06:47.150 --> 02:06:49.473]  The other ships are running.
[02:06:49.473 --> 02:06:51.155]  We'll catch them.
[02:06:51.155 --> 02:06:54.339]  When we do.
[02:06:54.339 --> 02:06:56.782]  There's gonna be a new world order, all right.
[02:06:56.782 --> 02:06:59.605]  But not the one they thought.
[02:06:59.605 --> 02:07:00.426]  All right.
[02:07:00.426 --> 02:07:01.708]  Coming in with some ministry.
[02:07:03.916 --> 02:07:07.539]  You know, the Ministry's a big fan of Al Jorgensen.
[02:07:07.539 --> 02:07:10.181]  His last four or five albums were InfoWars inspired.
[02:07:10.181 --> 02:07:13.404]  He is quite the interesting character.
[02:07:13.404 --> 02:07:16.706]  I'll leave it at that.
[02:07:16.706 --> 02:07:21.991]  Not name-dropping, there's a lot of folks who are listeners of the show.
[02:07:21.991 --> 02:07:27.055]  It just reminded me of something sad with another friend of mine that's in music, but I'm not going to get into that today.
[02:07:27.055 --> 02:07:31.559]  Bob Barnes, let's talk about this judge and play this newscast, because this again, this is not Alex Jones.
[02:07:32.925 --> 02:07:44.851]  I would not have a show every day spending 30-40 minutes about me, but the way we're being persecuted, what's happening, the way the news is saying, judge sanctions Jones for thinking he was framed with whoever sent me child porn.
[02:07:44.851 --> 02:07:50.094]  Well whoever sent it said I'm gonna kill you and had hidden porn links, of course they were trying to frame me.
[02:07:50.094 --> 02:07:53.455]  The media said that I was saying that Chris Maddy was that.
[02:07:53.455 --> 02:07:58.798]  I made it clear then and the next day before they filed these motions that it wasn't Chris Maddy when the press said that.
[02:07:59.318 --> 02:08:02.560]  This former Democrat Federal Prosecutor.
[02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:04.482]  So recapping how dangerous this is.
[02:08:04.482 --> 02:08:07.003]  There's no precedent out there for what this judge said.
[02:08:07.003 --> 02:08:09.085]  Norm Pattis was blown away by the judge.
[02:08:10.166 --> 02:08:10.466]  Yes it is.
[02:08:10.466 --> 02:08:12.228]  There have been prior attempts to issue gag orders on parties.
[02:08:36.857 --> 02:08:45.563]  But here there was no gag order in place because constitutionally there shouldn't be one, and the other side wants to be able to talk to the press at will.
[02:08:45.563 --> 02:08:53.067]  So when you have a situation like this, for people out there generally, our greater concern is the court got certain facts wrong here.
[02:08:53.067 --> 02:08:55.889]  It's much bigger than your case or your situation.
[02:08:55.889 --> 02:09:02.133]  This is about the public's right, because the public gets educated about their legal right through high-profile cases.
[02:09:02.697 --> 02:09:20.027]  And it's one reason why I have been involved in these for many years and have commented on them even in cases I'm not involved in, because the public gets their interpretation and their legal education through how the high-profile cases are covered and what they think they're entitled to or not entitled to, what rights they believe they have or do not have are shaped by that.
[02:09:20.027 --> 02:09:29.212]  And the very dangerous precedent that was being attempted to be set here was that if a court didn't like the out-of-court statement of a party
[02:09:29.773 --> 02:09:35.397]  You're criticizing the lawyer for the other side, not a party for the other side, but criticizing a lawyer for the other side.
[02:09:35.397 --> 02:09:51.950]  Even though she got a lot of the facts wrong about what she assumed took place here, putting that aside, even if she was right, it is a dangerous pattern and precedent to set to say that out-of-court speech that is otherwise completely protected by the First Amendment, by everybody's admission and acknowledgement,
[02:09:52.666 --> 02:10:06.522]  Uh, is somehow no longer subject to the First Amendment's protection, and is outside the First Amendment's protection, and a judge can use their mighty power of the gavel to effectively suppress, censor, and punish speech they dislike.
[02:10:06.522 --> 02:10:08.344]  So that's the scary part, part one.
[02:10:08.749 --> 02:10:23.692]  So not only would a gag order here would have been unconstitutional, you can't circumvent that unconstitutional provision by effectively punishing someone for engaging in speech you couldn't prohibit under the Constitution in the First Amendment in the first place.
[02:10:23.692 --> 02:10:31.934]  The second scary component of this is there's more and more lawyers who appear to believe that this isn't being particularly critical of the lawyers in Connecticut.
[02:10:31.934 --> 02:10:34.735]  This is about the general mindset of the lawyers across the country.
[02:10:35.182 --> 02:10:40.967]  Where there are more lawyers that I'm running into who believe that they're supposed to have a safe space protection around them.
[02:10:40.967 --> 02:10:48.534]  That means that if they bring a lawsuit, magically somehow because they bring a lawsuit, they're supposed to be immune from public criticism.
[02:10:48.534 --> 02:10:53.998]  I have been subject to more attacks than probably almost any high-profile lawyer in the country.
[02:10:53.998 --> 02:10:57.822]  I mean, after I was involved in the Covington case, it's just the most recent example.
[02:10:57.822 --> 02:11:01.245]  I have the FBI still investigating bomb threats against my offices.
[02:11:01.730 --> 02:11:04.191]  I had death threats on a repeated basis.
[02:11:04.191 --> 02:11:09.172]  I had people hack my email account, or try to, try to hack my social media account.
[02:11:09.172 --> 02:11:16.914]  They created a fake website, a fake site online that was supposed to be Barnes Law, and created fake reviews to defame me and libel me.
[02:11:16.914 --> 02:11:19.075]  And they did it behind anonymous rankings.
[02:11:19.912 --> 02:11:22.273]  This is annoying, but it's par for the course.
[02:11:22.273 --> 02:11:23.414]  This is what happened.
[02:11:23.414 --> 02:11:26.235]  All of that behavior is actually illicit behavior.
[02:11:26.235 --> 02:11:34.740]  What I never even thought of is to go to a bar association or go to a court and complain about other people saying bad things about me because I filed a suit.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:36.441]  That's just insane.
[02:11:36.441 --> 02:11:38.963]  But that's what the other lawyers in Texas are doing.
[02:11:38.963 --> 02:11:42.967]  They're trying to create a system where you can't even talk about what a lawyer has said about us.
[02:11:42.967 --> 02:11:43.727]  They can talk.
[02:11:43.727 --> 02:11:44.828]  The left can talk.
[02:11:44.828 --> 02:11:45.589]  But we can't.
[02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:49.352]  And then liberal judges go, or leftist judges say, that's the case.
[02:11:49.352 --> 02:11:50.513]  You're going to be here next week.
[02:11:50.513 --> 02:11:52.635]  We're going to make a big announcement.
[02:11:52.635 --> 02:11:55.657]  I'm going to leave it at that in the next week and a half or so.
[02:11:55.657 --> 02:11:57.839]  But we are definitely taking action.
[02:11:57.839 --> 02:11:59.361]  Then there's going to be some lawsuits after that.
[02:11:59.361 --> 02:12:00.081]  We're not litigious.
[02:12:00.081 --> 02:12:00.842]  We're not looking for that.
[02:12:00.842 --> 02:12:03.004]  But folks, you want people to fight for America.
[02:12:03.404 --> 02:12:05.505]  You want people to stand up and say no to the globalists.
[02:12:05.505 --> 02:12:09.227]  You want people to report on the Clintons and all the pedophile rings that are now in the news.
[02:12:09.227 --> 02:12:13.410]  You want people to, you know, expose globalism or the Islamic invasion.
[02:12:13.410 --> 02:12:15.371]  We're doing it.
[02:12:15.371 --> 02:12:16.952]  And we're not backing down.
[02:12:16.952 --> 02:12:19.533]  And we're exposing the Covington hoax first.
[02:12:19.533 --> 02:12:20.394]  We expose it first.
[02:12:20.394 --> 02:12:21.454]  We're exposing it all.
[02:12:21.454 --> 02:12:22.895]  We are the tip of the spear.
[02:12:22.895 --> 02:12:23.676]  You are the tip of the spear.
[02:12:23.676 --> 02:12:32.501]  And that's why everybody has to remember we're running a Save Infowars special right now to get more capital in because we've not been able to expand
[02:12:33.001 --> 02:12:35.082]  We've actually been contracting some.
[02:12:35.082 --> 02:12:36.903]  The enemy has been winning with all their attacks.
[02:12:36.903 --> 02:12:39.264]  We're still reaching a lot of people, thanks to you.
[02:12:39.264 --> 02:12:46.327]  But we need capital to get more reporters in the field to launch a bunch of stuff we've got ready to do that is going to devastate the globalists.
[02:12:46.327 --> 02:12:48.788]  And we've proven we don't talk, we deliver.
[02:12:48.788 --> 02:12:49.929]  But I need war bonds.
[02:12:49.929 --> 02:12:51.069]  I need capital.
[02:12:51.069 --> 02:12:52.590]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:12:52.590 --> 02:12:53.671]  Storewide free shipping.
[02:12:53.671 --> 02:12:55.311]  50% off.
[02:12:55.311 --> 02:12:56.412]  Double Patriot points.
[02:12:58.231 --> 02:13:02.337]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the supplements.
[02:13:02.337 --> 02:13:03.699]  Infowars store.
[02:13:06.534 --> 02:13:29.227]  We've got a bunch of new Made in America shirts with really soft designer fabric and really the highest quality imprints where the shirts are costing us up to $15 a piece and we're selling them on sale for $19.95 and that five bucks helps fund us but it's a great deal on the t-shirt that's still on sale that's already so popular.
[02:13:29.227 --> 02:13:31.569]  Space Force America's Back shirt.
[02:13:32.489 --> 02:13:38.535]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:13:38.535 --> 02:13:39.996]  Bob, if you've got to go, that's fine.
[02:13:39.996 --> 02:13:41.017]  I'm not putting you on the spot.
[02:13:41.017 --> 02:13:42.179]  If you've got to go, that's fine with me.
[02:13:42.179 --> 02:13:51.227]  If you want to do one more segment, I haven't gotten to this newscast with the media attacking me with what they're saying, what they're doing, just as a template and an example.
[02:13:51.227 --> 02:13:53.590]  If you've got time, I'd hold you over and play that and get your take.
[02:13:53.590 --> 02:13:55.872]  If not, closing comments, the last two minutes we have.
[02:13:57.199 --> 02:13:58.320]  No, I definitely have time.
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:06.423]  I mean, I think, as I've said the other day, and I said to the people in the press, your case is the template case for American freedom moving forward.
[02:14:06.423 --> 02:14:15.446]  And it's whether or not they can break the InfoWars base, whether or not they can stop the InfoWars audience from supporting the InfoWars network.
[02:14:15.446 --> 02:14:22.689]  Because again, like you said in corporate documents, the model of self-funding, self-sales, is the thing that corporations, the globalists, fear.
[02:14:22.689 --> 02:14:26.731]  Because crowdsourcing and individuals doing this scares the living daylights out of them.
[02:14:27.722 --> 02:14:28.182]  Absolutely.
[02:14:28.182 --> 02:14:33.065]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square.
[02:14:33.065 --> 02:14:41.469]  The other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[02:14:41.469 --> 02:14:43.410]  That's not backed by some billionaire.
[02:14:43.410 --> 02:14:46.231]  That's not being funded by secret foreign government.
[02:14:46.231 --> 02:14:49.373]  That's not being backed by a corporate advertiser.
[02:14:49.373 --> 02:14:51.414]  It is completely independent of all that.
[02:14:51.414 --> 02:14:53.695]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment.
[02:14:55.566 --> 02:14:58.868]  In the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech.
[02:14:58.868 --> 02:15:08.854]  That, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[02:15:08.854 --> 02:15:21.282]  And that ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear.
[02:15:21.722 --> 02:15:24.363]  And the Infowars audience has broken through that.
[02:15:24.363 --> 02:15:31.705]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age of ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[02:15:31.705 --> 02:15:39.268]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of de-platforming, defamation, lawfare, and libel targeting you.
[02:15:39.568 --> 02:15:49.418]  But as you said, like the Star Spangled Banner, in the morning the flag was still there and now the enemy is getting really pissed and putting out giant mega hoaxes against us.
[02:15:49.418 --> 02:15:50.880]  I see it as a sign of weakness.
[02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:52.281]  We'll see what Bob thinks on the other side.
[02:15:52.281 --> 02:15:54.464]  Then we're going to play this news report, then I'll come back.
[02:15:55.839 --> 02:16:06.882]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[02:16:55.014 --> 02:16:56.234]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.234 --> 02:17:00.155]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.155 --> 02:17:01.696]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.696 --> 02:17:04.657]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.657 --> 02:17:10.218]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.218 --> 02:17:11.418]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.418 --> 02:17:14.359]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:14.359 --> 02:17:16.580]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:17:16.580 --> 02:17:21.021]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:17:21.021 --> 02:17:23.302]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:17:24.582 --> 02:17:30.925]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:30.925 --> 02:17:33.966]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:33.966 --> 02:17:39.889]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:39.889 --> 02:17:43.690]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.690 --> 02:17:44.951]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:44.951 --> 02:17:46.292]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.292 --> 02:17:52.494]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:52.494 --> 02:17:53.935]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:58.183 --> 02:17:59.544]  Mike in New Jersey.
[02:17:59.544 --> 02:18:00.124]  You're on the air.
[02:18:00.124 --> 02:18:00.925]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[02:18:00.925 --> 02:18:02.286]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:18:02.286 --> 02:18:03.807]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:18:03.807 --> 02:18:04.588]  I'm so excited.
[02:18:04.588 --> 02:18:05.508]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:18:05.508 --> 02:18:07.990]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:10.492]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[02:18:10.492 --> 02:18:11.913]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:11.913 --> 02:18:13.354]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:13.354 --> 02:18:14.775]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:14.775 --> 02:18:15.996]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:15.996 --> 02:18:20.759]  Tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:18:20.759 --> 02:18:21.780]  It tastes like Ovaltine!
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:23.581]  It tastes like Ovaltine!
[02:18:23.581 --> 02:18:25.142]  It tastes like Ovaltine!
[02:18:25.142 --> 02:18:26.183]  Like, good!
[02:18:26.183 --> 02:18:26.823]  Whoa!
[02:18:26.823 --> 02:18:28.545]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:18:28.545 --> 02:18:32.727]  My daughter uses the Bubblegum Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:18:32.727 --> 02:18:38.571]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for that as well.
[02:18:38.571 --> 02:18:41.133]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products to get me some air.
[02:18:41.133 --> 02:18:48.338]  I'm thanking you, but yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[02:18:48.338 --> 02:18:49.078]  It is next level.
[02:18:49.078 --> 02:18:50.099]  It really is good, so thank you.
[02:18:50.239 --> 02:18:52.199]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:18:52.199 --> 02:18:56.080]  Thank you.
[02:18:56.080 --> 02:19:04.462]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:19:04.462 --> 02:19:05.923]  Believe me, I know.
[02:19:05.923 --> 02:19:10.624]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:19:10.624 --> 02:19:15.625]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:19:15.865 --> 02:19:36.023]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:19:36.523 --> 02:19:40.285]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:19:40.285 --> 02:19:44.188]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:19:44.188 --> 02:19:49.191]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:19:49.191 --> 02:19:51.912]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:19:51.912 --> 02:19:58.796]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:58.796 --> 02:20:01.458]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:25.822 --> 02:20:30.008]  Yeah folks, let me tell you when the bullet hits the bone.
[02:20:42.045 --> 02:20:47.808]  And they've got hundreds of articles republished in all the local newspapers where I live.
[02:20:47.808 --> 02:20:49.368]  Family calling from Dallas, Houston.
[02:20:49.368 --> 02:20:51.409]  I'm on the front page of the paper.
[02:20:51.409 --> 02:20:53.310]  Alex Jones sent child porn.
[02:20:53.310 --> 02:20:54.551]  None of it's true.
[02:20:54.551 --> 02:21:00.453]  Alex Jones lost a lawsuit for a book he wrote with Professor Jim Fetzer saying nobody died at Sandy Hook.
[02:21:00.453 --> 02:21:01.654]  None of it's true.
[02:21:01.654 --> 02:21:03.034]  Front of Facebook.
[02:21:03.034 --> 02:21:04.255]  Front of Twitter.
[02:21:04.255 --> 02:21:07.456]  Front of Yahoo.
[02:21:07.456 --> 02:21:08.017]  That's what they do.
[02:21:08.973 --> 02:21:15.557]  That's when the bullet hits the bone and you go, my God, they are just as evil as I thought they were.
[02:21:15.557 --> 02:21:16.037]  Unbelievable.
[02:21:16.037 --> 02:21:17.878]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyers here.
[02:21:17.878 --> 02:21:18.999]  This is about America.
[02:21:18.999 --> 02:21:20.800]  This is about a press out of control.
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:24.022]  This is about fake news on steroids.
[02:21:24.022 --> 02:21:27.063]  Let's go to part of this local TV station piece.
[02:21:27.063 --> 02:21:30.345]  And Bob, just say pause anytime you want.
[02:21:30.345 --> 02:21:33.507]  And if you want to make comments, as I'm obviously
[02:21:33.547 --> 02:21:35.168]  Yeah, I don't let that man say he's being framed.
[02:21:35.168 --> 02:21:36.428]  My goodness gracious, shut him up right now.
[02:21:36.428 --> 02:21:36.688]  Here it is.
[02:21:56.800 --> 02:21:59.382]  Alex Jones in trouble here in Connecticut.
[02:21:59.382 --> 02:22:03.424]  Jones, who once called the Sandy Hook massacre a hoax, is causing another story.
[02:22:03.424 --> 02:22:10.267]  And this time, it's over implying that an attorney representing those families tried to frame him with child pornography.
[02:22:10.267 --> 02:22:16.330]  Today, both sides were in court for a hearing, and so was Channel 3 New Haven Bureau Chief Matt McFarland, who joins us live now with what happened, Matt.
[02:22:19.264 --> 02:22:32.239]  Well, Dennis, the judge came down on Jones and his attorneys, sanctioning the InfoWars host, claiming and saying that his behavior was indefensible, unconscionable, and possibly criminal.
[02:22:32.239 --> 02:22:35.363]  They say when he made those statements online, they said
[02:22:35.743 --> 02:22:41.945]  Now, the judge said if he wanted to have an issue and he thought he was being framed and set up, she says he could have gone to authorities.
[02:22:41.945 --> 02:22:44.385]  She says he could have filed a motion with the court.
[02:22:44.385 --> 02:22:53.207]  But she says when he went on his web show and actually named attorney Chris Maddy and made these allegations, she says that's when he crossed the line.
[02:22:53.207 --> 02:22:57.628]  Let's zoom in on Chris Maddy.
[02:22:57.628 --> 02:23:00.449]  Oh, nice little Chris Maddy.
[02:23:04.494 --> 02:23:06.555]  What a good American!
[02:23:06.555 --> 02:23:08.597]  What a good boy!
[02:23:08.597 --> 02:23:10.438]  You think you'll put on me?
[02:23:10.438 --> 02:23:11.119]  What?
[02:23:11.119 --> 02:23:13.780]  Anyways, I'm done!
[02:23:13.780 --> 02:23:14.761]  Total war!
[02:23:14.761 --> 02:23:15.622]  You want it, you got it!
[02:23:15.622 --> 02:23:25.608]  It's this recent roughly 20-minute rant by InfoWars host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, with his attorney Norm Pettis by his side, that led to lawyers meeting in this Bridgeport courtroom today.
[02:23:25.608 --> 02:23:30.932]  Attorneys representing Sandy Hook families in their defamation lawsuit against Jones filed a motion with the court
[02:23:31.212 --> 02:23:57.245]  asking for sanctions and penalties saying they've had to reach out to law enforcement and are getting threats after Jones mentioned attorney Chris Maddy by name showing his picture and inferring that Maddy was behind the child pornography that turned up in emails handed over during discovery Jones and his attorney argued the emails had been sent to him by others and that no one associated with him ever opened them even offering a reward to anyone who could provide information leading to a conviction
[02:23:57.785 --> 02:24:01.306]  They say the FBI is now investigating who sent the emails.
[02:24:01.306 --> 02:24:11.127]  Today in court, attorneys representing Jones argued he had walked back his initial comments, claiming what Jones said wasn't a threat or harassment, and that he has a right to free speech.
[02:24:11.127 --> 02:24:17.108]  But the judge wasn't buying it, handing down the sanctions, saying Jones' words and actions were unacceptable.
[02:24:17.108 --> 02:24:21.089]  Let me say this about Mr. Jones' conduct.
[02:24:21.089 --> 02:24:26.690]  His conduct, and I think the court concluded this, really threatened the integrity of judicial proceedings here in Connecticut.
[02:24:27.633 --> 02:24:30.750]  And that was the basis for why she imposed sanctions and we think it was appropriate.
[02:24:33.174 --> 02:24:35.515]  Now, we're told Jones' attorneys will appeal today's ruling.
[02:24:35.515 --> 02:24:42.437]  Now, up on that 6-4 courtroom today, as part of the sanctions, the judge ruled that Jones has lost his special motion to dismiss this case.
[02:24:42.437 --> 02:24:48.499]  He'll also be responsible for paying the plaintiff's attorney's fees regarding the child pornography issue.
[02:24:48.499 --> 02:24:52.741]  As for the defamation lawsuit, a trial date has been set for November of 2020.
[02:24:52.741 --> 02:24:58.323]  We're live with the Mobile Newsroom in Bridgeport, Matt McFarlane, Channel 3 Eyewitness News.
[02:24:58.323 --> 02:25:01.404]  So, Bob, what's your take on that?
[02:25:02.369 --> 02:25:02.930]  Couple of things.
[02:25:02.930 --> 02:25:04.811]  You notice how they're mixing and matching things.
[02:25:04.811 --> 02:25:10.376]  So this is how the media lies when they are at least more successful at lying outside of the libel law.
[02:25:10.376 --> 02:25:15.400]  What they do is, so they took something that involved a legitimate concern where there's no question.
[02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:17.702]  The FBI has already confirmed you're innocent.
[02:25:17.702 --> 02:25:20.745]  The FBI has already confirmed that someone was sending you malware.
[02:25:20.745 --> 02:25:23.807]  The FBI has already confirmed that someone was trying to frame you.
[02:25:23.807 --> 02:25:24.988]  None of that is in dispute.
[02:25:24.988 --> 02:25:26.009]  None of that is in controversy.
[02:25:26.496 --> 02:25:37.663]  But they confuse and conflate that issue with the separate issue of whether or not negative statements made about the lawyer constitute a basis for sanction.
[02:25:37.663 --> 02:25:48.450]  And instead, they make it sound like, oh, you know, Jones says he was set up, but really the judge didn't make that determination, and the judge is really sanctioning him for saying he was set up, which is all false.
[02:25:48.871 --> 02:25:50.512]  That isn't what happened in the court proceedings.
[02:25:50.512 --> 02:25:51.793]  That isn't what the judge did.
[02:25:51.793 --> 02:25:52.914]  That isn't what the lawyers did.
[02:25:52.914 --> 02:25:53.975]  That isn't what happened.
[02:25:53.975 --> 02:25:56.356]  So that's the creative way in which the press lies.
[02:25:56.356 --> 02:25:58.058]  They lie by association.
[02:25:58.058 --> 02:25:59.679]  They lie by affiliation.
[02:25:59.679 --> 02:26:01.220]  They lie by innuendo.
[02:26:01.220 --> 02:26:07.944]  They lie by connecting things that are actually not connected to one another to create a bigger, broader, wider, deeper lie.
[02:26:07.944 --> 02:26:12.688]  So part of what the media station here is doing that and that's what the media coverage is trying to do.
[02:26:12.688 --> 02:26:17.952]  They're trying to say, oh actually the judge rebuked Jones for saying that he was set up or that he was framed.
[02:26:17.952 --> 02:26:18.512]  Totally false!
[02:26:18.812 --> 02:26:20.013]  Judge said no such thing.
[02:26:20.013 --> 02:26:21.293]  Judge didn't rule on that at all.
[02:26:21.293 --> 02:26:36.302]  In fact, it's undisputed and incontroverted that someone tried to deliberately sabotage you, deliberately undermine you, deliberately try to frame you, and the press went along with it with their false and libelous headline.
[02:26:36.302 --> 02:26:38.823]  Nobody in court has ever said anything different.
[02:26:38.823 --> 02:26:42.525]  So there, that's the biggest sort of innuendo lie that they're trying to tell.
[02:26:42.525 --> 02:26:46.227]  The second part there is the attempt by the defense lawyer, the plaintiff's lawyer,
[02:26:46.727 --> 02:26:51.990]  To defend the court's ruling by saying that somehow judicial proceedings were jeopardized.
[02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:53.251]  Complete nonsense.
[02:26:53.251 --> 02:26:54.711]  The First Amendment is clear.
[02:26:54.711 --> 02:27:05.877]  The First Amendment does not allow a court to say, well, I want lawyers to be specially protected, and so I'm not going to allow harmful speech to be issued against them.
[02:27:05.877 --> 02:27:07.118]  That's just not the case.
[02:27:07.118 --> 02:27:15.142]  There has to be a call for imminent lawless action under the Brandenburg decision, under the Skokie decision, under the Westboro Baptist decision.
[02:27:15.478 --> 02:27:19.059]  In each of those cases, people were saying things that were truly offensive.
[02:27:19.059 --> 02:27:25.962]  I mean, you had the Nazis marching in the neighborhood that had the highest per capita number of Holocaust victims in America.
[02:27:25.962 --> 02:27:32.364]  You had the Klan organizing in the Brandenburg case right outside of an African-American neighborhood.
[02:27:32.364 --> 02:27:35.065]  And Bob, we're almost out of time, but in closing here, we talked last night.
[02:27:35.065 --> 02:27:38.406]  I mean, you want to get into the fact that we didn't do this on purpose.
[02:27:38.406 --> 02:27:39.066]  I got mad.
[02:27:39.066 --> 02:27:40.246]  They mixed together what I said.
[02:27:40.246 --> 02:27:41.407]  They misrepresented.
[02:27:41.407 --> 02:27:42.367]  We're not worried about that.
[02:27:42.367 --> 02:27:44.588]  Yeah, they're trying to get criminal charges, all the rest of it, whatever.
[02:27:45.428 --> 02:27:46.549]  Uh, whatever.
[02:27:46.549 --> 02:27:48.050]  It'll just make us more of a martyr.
[02:27:48.050 --> 02:27:49.471]  People don't know this is true.
[02:27:49.471 --> 02:27:51.893]  So fill your hand if that's what you want to do politically.
[02:27:51.893 --> 02:27:57.117]  But you made the point that the judge was probably going to throw out our slap deal anyways, the way she's been behaving.
[02:27:57.117 --> 02:27:59.058]  But now they've got an actionable appeal.
[02:27:59.058 --> 02:28:03.301]  We've got a good chance of winning by this precipitous action.
[02:28:03.301 --> 02:28:03.942]  No doubt.
[02:28:03.942 --> 02:28:11.447]  They made a mistake and the tactical decisions they made and the judge made a mistake because the judge made it clear that there's a frankly a lack of respect
[02:28:11.766 --> 02:28:11.846]  Yes.
[02:28:31.471 --> 02:28:40.460]  And so I think, consequently, the protection of the First Amendment of the United States, the lead person doing it, the lead organization doing it, is in full force.
[02:28:40.460 --> 02:28:44.865]  You are the key to defending the First Amendment for everybody moving forward.
[02:28:44.865 --> 02:28:46.787]  And I have no criminal record, no history of it.
[02:28:46.787 --> 02:28:48.489]  I'm in another state.
[02:28:48.489 --> 02:28:50.310]  Clearly, they just made all this up.
[02:28:50.310 --> 02:28:51.291]  All right, God bless you, Bob.
[02:28:51.291 --> 02:28:52.513]  We'll talk to you in the studio soon.
[02:28:52.513 --> 02:28:53.494]  We'll be right back with The Big News.
[02:28:55.413 --> 02:29:06.600]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:13.484]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[02:29:13.524 --> 02:29:13.944]  I think so.
[02:29:36.775 --> 02:29:40.377]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:29:40.377 --> 02:29:40.577]  Go ahead.
[02:29:59.199 --> 02:30:01.201]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[02:30:01.201 --> 02:30:05.063]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:30:05.063 --> 02:30:06.504]  It just gets old, man.
[02:30:06.504 --> 02:30:08.906]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:30:08.906 --> 02:30:11.227]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:30:11.227 --> 02:30:15.250]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:30:15.250 --> 02:30:18.532]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:30:18.532 --> 02:30:20.894]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:30:20.894 --> 02:30:22.595]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:30:22.595 --> 02:30:23.716]  Us being shut down?
[02:30:23.716 --> 02:30:24.757]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:30:25.177 --> 02:30:26.278]  You know what, Alex?
[02:30:26.278 --> 02:30:27.358]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[02:30:27.358 --> 02:30:28.459]  Hey, Frank!
[02:30:28.459 --> 02:30:34.122]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:30:34.122 --> 02:30:38.624]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:30:38.624 --> 02:30:41.766]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:30:41.766 --> 02:30:42.226]  You understand?
[02:30:42.226 --> 02:30:43.867]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:30:43.867 --> 02:30:44.988]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:30:45.988 --> 02:30:51.600]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:30:51.600 --> 02:30:52.321]  Do you understand?
[02:30:52.321 --> 02:30:53.964]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:30:53.964 --> 02:30:55.427]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[02:30:56.305 --> 02:30:58.988]  I want to be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[02:30:58.988 --> 02:31:00.790]  We're going into the season of war.
[02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:06.877]  And they have been inches from shutting down the final mega accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[02:31:06.877 --> 02:31:10.541]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[02:31:10.541 --> 02:31:11.462]  We need to end here.
[02:31:11.462 --> 02:31:12.783]  We need to be provisioned.
[02:31:12.783 --> 02:31:16.988]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[02:31:17.368 --> 02:31:21.233]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[02:31:21.233 --> 02:31:23.155]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[02:31:23.155 --> 02:31:26.699]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[02:31:26.699 --> 02:31:28.140]  That just brings more people here.
[02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:31.444]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[02:31:31.444 --> 02:31:32.285]  I need gas.
[02:31:32.285 --> 02:31:33.807]  I need ammo politically now.
[02:31:34.187 --> 02:31:40.490]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[02:31:40.490 --> 02:31:41.610]  We're unstoppable together.
[02:31:41.610 --> 02:31:43.031]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[02:31:43.031 --> 02:31:50.054]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[02:31:50.054 --> 02:31:51.034]  You have my commitment.
[02:31:51.034 --> 02:31:55.376]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[02:31:57.108 --> 02:32:01.474]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[02:32:01.474 --> 02:32:09.124]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[02:32:09.124 --> 02:32:12.008]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving it.
[02:32:12.348 --> 02:32:13.309]  I like to be expanding.
[02:32:13.309 --> 02:32:13.949]  I like to be winning.
[02:32:13.949 --> 02:32:14.489]  I like to be fighting.
[02:32:34.341 --> 02:32:35.742]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:15.204 --> 02:33:22.131]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[02:33:22.131 --> 02:33:26.435]  You better believe you've got one!
[02:33:26.435 --> 02:33:31.540]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:43.834 --> 02:33:49.977]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:33:49.977 --> 02:33:57.220]  Ellie Weaver's going to pop in, but I've got three really powerful reports that I saw on YouTube.
[02:33:57.220 --> 02:34:03.002]  And so many of these people I've never heard of, and I just get stuck for hours watching their great research.
[02:34:03.002 --> 02:34:09.805]  So I want to talk about those folks and alert you to their presence, though many of you are probably already aware of who they are.
[02:34:11.437 --> 02:34:15.300]  And one of them I found out about because they were banned on YouTube.
[02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:16.200]  There was a big protest.
[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:20.703]  I went and watched it, very intellectual, from a liberal perspective.
[02:34:20.703 --> 02:34:24.166]  Not a leftist perspective, but a liberal perspective.
[02:34:24.166 --> 02:34:27.028]  That's coming up next hour.
[02:34:27.028 --> 02:34:35.434]  Paul Watson did a very informative report on cyberpunk that came out in the 1980s that a black writer created.
[02:34:38.171 --> 02:34:41.472]  People are wondering how they predicted everything so exactly.
[02:34:41.472 --> 02:34:44.093]  I'm going to explain something.
[02:34:44.093 --> 02:34:48.976]  I'm not saying that the author of the Cyberpunk series is a bad guy.
[02:34:48.976 --> 02:34:52.697]  My dad was in research science when he was in high school.
[02:34:52.697 --> 02:34:56.459]  And he was in Plan 2 at UT, where high school kids went to UT, okay?
[02:34:56.459 --> 02:35:04.102]  And they're like, the public doesn't know about our nuclear reactors, or our computers, or... By the time he was going to UT, as a, you know, adult,
[02:35:05.083 --> 02:35:09.106]  Young adult, they already had CD-ROM, all this stuff.
[02:35:09.106 --> 02:35:17.113]  What you're shown in the news and what they admit to is only the tip of the iceberg.
[02:35:17.113 --> 02:35:24.439]  And so we're going to play that Cyberpunk, the early accurate predictions of Cyberpunk 2020 next hour as well with my analysis.
[02:35:24.439 --> 02:35:29.504]  So it's a big fourth hour today.
[02:35:29.504 --> 02:35:31.785]  And we're doing a lot of exciting stuff.
[02:35:37.970 --> 02:35:43.392]  Bought Millie Weaver and crew, because they're contractors, an RV.
[02:35:43.392 --> 02:35:51.015]  Our RV burned up in a big famous fire that happened in Round Rock a few months ago.
[02:35:51.015 --> 02:35:54.477]  Hundreds of RVs burned up from an electrical fire.
[02:35:54.477 --> 02:35:58.439]  So I took the money from the insurance of that and I just bought them an RV.
[02:35:58.439 --> 02:35:59.519]  I didn't give it to them.
[02:35:59.519 --> 02:36:01.380]  I gave them an interest-free loan over the years.
[02:36:04.369 --> 02:36:05.730]  I'm not bragging here.
[02:36:05.730 --> 02:36:06.931]  They're on fire.
[02:36:06.931 --> 02:36:07.952]  Kaitlin Bennett works with her.
[02:36:07.952 --> 02:36:09.393]  She hired Kaitlin Bennett.
[02:36:09.393 --> 02:36:11.555]  They're contractors together.
[02:36:11.555 --> 02:36:15.518]  She goes around with her husband and Kaitlin goes around with her fiance.
[02:36:15.518 --> 02:36:17.439]  They get physically attacked and they get everything.
[02:36:19.605 --> 02:36:39.209]  You know, if Caitlyn Bennett comes along and says, I've got an idea, or I got her to town, but they were so busy shooting stuff, going down to the abortion rallies, the pro-abortion rallies to cover them, and getting beat up by those women that I could never get with Caitlyn, even have time to go, how can I finance, while I still have money, getting you on your feet even more because you kick ass so much?
[02:36:39.209 --> 02:36:42.950]  You see, and I'm going to go back to this, I'm going to hit all the news.
[02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:46.731]  When I get up here to talk about Paul, me throwing him out of the nest, that's not like bragging.
[02:36:49.038 --> 02:36:50.283]  It had to be done.
[02:36:50.283 --> 02:36:53.035]  Anybody ever read Oliver Stone's
[02:36:54.628 --> 02:36:56.769]  And Millis is Conan the Barbarian.
[02:36:56.769 --> 02:36:57.949]  It's a very good movie.
[02:36:57.949 --> 02:37:00.230]  Conan the Destroyer is a terrible movie.
[02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:03.170]  But Conan's already the top gladiator in the world, the known world.
[02:37:03.170 --> 02:37:07.171]  And he's sleeping outside.
[02:37:07.171 --> 02:37:10.612]  They come out with an axe and hack off the chains and say, go.
[02:37:10.612 --> 02:37:18.835]  Because it's just not right to have somebody who's successful and strong and good under your wings anymore.
[02:37:18.835 --> 02:37:20.055]  It's time for them to go.
[02:37:21.459 --> 02:37:22.539]  It's time to be emancipated.
[02:37:22.539 --> 02:37:23.519]  It's time to not be a slave.
[02:37:23.519 --> 02:37:26.280]  I'm not saying Paul is my slave, but I know Paul.
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:27.781]  I've talked to folks that know him well in England.
[02:37:27.781 --> 02:37:29.361]  It's like, yeah, I like Alex.
[02:37:29.361 --> 02:37:33.902]  I like what he does, but he is kind of a maniac and I want to be my own person.
[02:37:33.902 --> 02:37:34.522]  I'm like, well, good.
[02:37:34.522 --> 02:37:37.023]  Let me help you be your own person.
[02:37:37.023 --> 02:37:39.323]  And it's the same thing with Owen.
[02:37:39.323 --> 02:37:40.404]  It's the same thing with Millie.
[02:37:40.404 --> 02:37:41.904]  It's the same thing with all these people.
[02:37:41.904 --> 02:37:45.105]  I probably got 15 reporters I want to hire.
[02:37:45.105 --> 02:37:47.865]  I don't have the money to do it.
[02:37:47.865 --> 02:37:50.306]  But I'll tell you this, the reason why Millie pitched me this
[02:37:52.682 --> 02:37:54.203]  Lower tier RV, but it's new.
[02:37:54.203 --> 02:37:57.884]  What's the point of having one breaking a lot?
[02:37:57.884 --> 02:38:02.886]  It's one of the lower end ones, but it's, you know, kind of the plain Jane one that has a good record.
[02:38:02.886 --> 02:38:06.247]  I'm like, yeah, I'm paying for hotels and I'm paying for airplanes everywhere.
[02:38:06.247 --> 02:38:08.468]  It's cheaper just to get you the RV.
[02:38:08.468 --> 02:38:13.450]  But I said, the great part about it is it's yours and you just go into the future and hopefully you pay me back.
[02:38:14.298 --> 02:38:23.650]  But I'm in the process here, with the enemy trying to shut us down, of trying to get as many people as I can ready, trained, in the field.
[02:38:23.650 --> 02:38:27.335]  And I want to really expand that operation, but that takes capital.
[02:38:27.335 --> 02:38:29.218]  And I mean, take the Marine Corps, or the U.S.
[02:38:29.218 --> 02:38:31.160]  Army, or any military that has a history.
[02:38:32.079 --> 02:38:37.882]  You don't have the officers and the people trying to stay in charge forever and looking down on the troops.
[02:38:37.882 --> 02:38:45.426]  You're looking for who's the best in the organization to promote them up and teach them everything you know so they'll be better than you.
[02:38:45.426 --> 02:38:58.533]  And then when it comes time to die, I don't mean physically, but time to be destroyed, in case you get shot when you're out there leading armies on the battlefield, you need to have other officer corps ready to step in and take action.
[02:38:59.292 --> 02:39:02.033]  And we've had a 25-year run, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:02.033 --> 02:39:15.536]  But let me tell you, when they're running front-page Twitter for two days, that I'm sending out child porn when it's not true, and that I write books about stuff I didn't write, and it's totally made up, that means they're letting me know, buddy, this is the last straw.
[02:39:15.536 --> 02:39:16.196]  Well, guess what?
[02:39:16.196 --> 02:39:18.237]  I get it, and I'm out backing down.
[02:39:18.237 --> 02:39:19.857]  So, do whatever you gotta do.
[02:39:19.857 --> 02:39:21.477]  You have to deal with Jesus Christ.
[02:39:21.477 --> 02:39:23.078]  And if it's God's plan, I'm destroyed?
[02:39:23.078 --> 02:39:23.658]  That's the way it is.
[02:39:23.658 --> 02:39:25.798]  I have no fear.
[02:39:25.798 --> 02:39:28.099]  I have fear, and I'm about to cover what I have fear of.
[02:39:29.292 --> 02:39:37.102]  I have fear of letting monsters like Hillary Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein and others continue to do what they do.
[02:39:37.102 --> 02:39:45.693]  And so, if vampires were real, and I opened a door and there was a vampire bent over one of my kids about to bite him, I would attack that vampire with everything I got.
[02:39:46.772 --> 02:39:51.273]  Doesn't mean I want to fight some six foot seven vampire with superhuman strength, but I'm going to do it.
[02:39:51.273 --> 02:39:55.794]  And you know, there's a chance I might actually get a good stab into him.
[02:39:55.794 --> 02:39:57.935]  Okay, maybe he'll limp off and somebody else gets him.
[02:39:57.935 --> 02:40:01.115]  The point is, is that you want to fight man, you got one.
[02:40:01.115 --> 02:40:02.476]  You understand that?
[02:40:02.476 --> 02:40:06.797]  So, but I think the listeners need to understand we've entered Mordor.
[02:40:06.797 --> 02:40:11.338]  Infowars, myself particularly, is now right down to the wire with the enemy.
[02:40:12.125 --> 02:40:18.050]  And we've grievously wounded them, we've grievously hurt them, and they intend to take us out of the fight.
[02:40:18.050 --> 02:40:24.496]  But however the breaks happen, however the dice roll, however providence works, we know God's on our side and that's what matters.
[02:40:24.496 --> 02:40:25.897]  And it's God's plan.
[02:40:25.897 --> 02:40:27.859]  Satan is not in control.
[02:40:27.859 --> 02:40:31.863]  Satan is only in control of his minions, his pathetic servants.
[02:40:31.863 --> 02:40:33.564]  So thank God you're not part of that.
[02:40:33.564 --> 02:40:38.409]  When we come back, the huge stack that I didn't even have the will to cover yesterday,
[02:40:42.162 --> 02:41:00.179]  Okay, because I re-read all this this morning, I spent about 30 minutes looking over this, and it's, it's, when you understand that convicted child traffickers, child sex traffickers run Amber Alert, you're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:41:00.179 --> 02:41:06.705]  And when you realize Hillary, it's on NBC News, was caught running a pedophile ring, and that's why
[02:41:07.844 --> 02:41:13.046]  They brought up the whole Pizzagate thing and twisted all that to have one part of it not true so they could discredit the whole thing.
[02:41:13.046 --> 02:41:15.747]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:41:15.747 --> 02:41:22.849]  So what I want to do is I want to really just take on the enemy with everything we got.
[02:41:23.703 --> 02:41:27.024]  And I just want to signal to everybody, all the other signals have been real.
[02:41:27.024 --> 02:41:29.205]  All the other flags I've shot up have been, hey, we need help.
[02:41:29.205 --> 02:41:30.366]  Thank you for the help.
[02:41:30.366 --> 02:41:37.529]  But man, now I'm just telling you, we need to provision this operation as if no more funding is going to come in for a while.
[02:41:37.529 --> 02:41:39.870]  And we've got to dig in ahead of election 2020.
[02:41:39.870 --> 02:41:41.951]  And we've got to stand behind the president.
[02:41:41.951 --> 02:41:44.972]  And we've got to just realize this is not a regular election.
[02:41:44.972 --> 02:41:47.814]  This is not a regular time to be politically involved.
[02:41:47.814 --> 02:41:48.334]  This is war.
[02:41:49.346 --> 02:41:52.530]  This isn't like going out and having some baked beans and some hamburgers.
[02:41:52.530 --> 02:41:53.451]  Fourth of July, baby.
[02:41:53.451 --> 02:41:56.395]  This is what the Fourth of July is all about.
[02:41:56.395 --> 02:42:00.760]  And the globalists are trying to silence me, and you, and everybody else with intimidation.
[02:42:00.760 --> 02:42:05.286]  And we need a strong message to them that we're not backing down, we're not giving in.
[02:42:05.286 --> 02:42:06.487]  And that's finances.
[02:42:07.492 --> 02:42:14.798]  That's hard, cold cash and products sold and donations at InfoWorksStore.com.

[02:43:11.282 --> 02:43:13.083]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[02:43:13.083 --> 02:43:14.564]  We need money to fight back.
[02:43:14.704 --> 02:43:17.366]  And to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.

[02:43:35.740 --> 02:43:39.464]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[02:43:39.464 --> 02:43:40.305]  We're not going to back down.
[02:43:55.774 --> 02:44:02.422]  Infowars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so.
[02:44:02.422 --> 02:44:07.108]  It's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane.
[02:44:07.108 --> 02:44:10.852]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time
[02:44:11.733 --> 02:44:17.595]  to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[02:44:17.595 --> 02:44:21.697]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real S.O.S.
[02:44:21.697 --> 02:44:28.599]  If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, InfoWars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[02:44:28.599 --> 02:44:29.440]  And so we've reached that point.
[02:44:30.259 --> 02:44:32.140]  It'll make the enemy happy, but, you know, whatever.
[02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:34.241]  We have withstood so many of their attacks.
[02:44:34.241 --> 02:44:36.823]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[02:44:36.823 --> 02:44:38.184]  You have been there.
[02:44:38.184 --> 02:44:42.986]  But let me tell you, they are pissed they haven't been successful, and they're giving us their full assault.
[02:44:42.986 --> 02:44:49.110]  So we need your prayers, your financial support, and your word of mouth now at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:44:49.110 --> 02:44:50.090]  It's your fight.
[02:44:50.090 --> 02:44:54.413]  Decide whether or not you want InfoWars to continue, because we could be shut down.
[02:44:56.397 --> 02:45:00.563]  The Globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:45:00.563 --> 02:45:01.624]  They are technocrats.
[02:45:01.624 --> 02:45:03.927]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[02:45:03.927 --> 02:45:10.816]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:45:11.357 --> 02:45:13.139]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:45:13.139 --> 02:45:15.621]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[02:45:15.621 --> 02:45:22.106]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:45:22.106 --> 02:45:27.311]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:45:27.311 --> 02:45:36.318]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[02:45:37.279 --> 02:45:43.266]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.

[02:47:16.871 --> 02:47:28.260]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:28.260 --> 02:47:37.627]  Alright, we've got some bad news and we've got some really, really fantastic news, and then I'm gonna get into the Clintons.
[02:47:39.511 --> 02:47:49.839]  And the NBC News report from years ago, and now new reports of new investigations of the pedophile reigns they run to control government inside the State Department.
[02:47:49.839 --> 02:47:51.801]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:47:51.801 --> 02:47:53.923]  I'm hosting fourth hour today.
[02:47:53.923 --> 02:47:56.465]  It's going to be particularly powerful.
[02:47:56.465 --> 02:47:58.406]  Then the War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:47:58.406 --> 02:47:58.787]  Central.
[02:47:58.787 --> 02:48:00.668]  Don't forget the David Knight Show, 8 a.m.
[02:48:00.668 --> 02:48:04.051]  weekdays, and I do the Sunday Show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:48:04.051 --> 02:48:04.311]  Okay.
[02:48:07.418 --> 02:48:11.900]  Here is the bad news, but it just illustrates what we're talking about.
[02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:20.645]  You know they've banned the political party sites on Facebook and other platforms that are for the president of Brazil.
[02:48:20.645 --> 02:48:24.928]  You know they've banned most of Trump's support on YouTube and Facebook.
[02:48:24.928 --> 02:48:26.088]  And Google's manipulated the rankings.
[02:48:26.088 --> 02:48:34.012]  Well now YouTube deletes channel of Spain's populist Vox party that has been winning elections.
[02:48:34.012 --> 02:48:36.194]  Facebook just banned their site a month ago.
[02:48:37.113 --> 02:48:40.736]  That's mainline populist parties.
[02:48:40.736 --> 02:48:41.177]  Banned.
[02:48:41.177 --> 02:48:45.681]  That's globalist operations right there.
[02:48:45.681 --> 02:48:50.345]  I've told you that Senator Josh Hawley, former Attorney General of Missouri,
[02:48:51.889 --> 02:48:54.831]  Top of his class, American patriot.
[02:48:54.831 --> 02:48:57.132]  I get a good feeling about him, not just his words.
[02:48:57.132 --> 02:49:14.403]  Talk about the value of family, and of a little fishing pond behind your house, and of just being hardworking, and not wanting to be part of Hollywood, or the globalist system, but just wanting to be on the PTA, or, you know, wanting to help fix old people's cars, or just being a good human.
[02:49:14.403 --> 02:49:15.123]  That's so fulfilling.
[02:49:15.123 --> 02:49:16.704]  Loving Jesus.
[02:49:16.704 --> 02:49:20.787]  And he's been fighting Google since he was the Attorney General.
[02:49:22.575 --> 02:49:28.919]  And I've watched him over and over again when he brings out the Chi-Coms and the Globalists and says it's time for action.
[02:49:28.919 --> 02:49:31.941]  All the bills he introduced are amazing.
[02:49:31.941 --> 02:49:35.803]  So I've been signaling him out as the type of leadership we need.
[02:49:35.803 --> 02:49:38.744]  Just watching the work he's done the last year or so.
[02:49:38.744 --> 02:49:41.966]  Josh Hawley takes on Big Tech, which means they're going to come after him.
[02:49:41.966 --> 02:49:42.327]  You understand?
[02:49:42.327 --> 02:49:46.449]  That's like taking on the CIA and everybody else at the same time.
[02:49:46.449 --> 02:49:51.472]  Josh Hawley takes on Big Tech's censors with a new bill that would strip them of immunity.
[02:49:52.534 --> 02:49:55.156]  I'm going to cover this more in the next hour.
[02:49:55.156 --> 02:50:01.901]  And New York lawmakers OK allowing illegal aliens to get a driver's license and of course to vote.
[02:50:01.901 --> 02:50:06.124]  And we've got Ebola spreading now into multiple countries, getting outside Africa.
[02:50:06.124 --> 02:50:11.748]  And there's over 300,000 flee violence in Congo amid massive Ebola outbreak, breakdown of society.
[02:50:11.748 --> 02:50:14.450]  Newswars.com, that's directly from the U.N.
[02:50:14.450 --> 02:50:16.071]  And they're all being told, come to the U.S.
[02:50:16.071 --> 02:50:17.672]  Unvetted to Texas.
[02:50:17.672 --> 02:50:18.593]  And they are.
[02:50:19.721 --> 02:50:25.443]  Trump's being called a terrorist for saying that he wants to screen people for Ebola.
[02:50:25.443 --> 02:50:34.706]  Now, when you fly in from England or something, they check your passport, but now if you're coming in illegally from Africa, from Congo, you go straight into the country.
[02:50:34.706 --> 02:50:39.988]  The Democrats still control the courts in many areas, and it's just a nightmare situation.
[02:50:39.988 --> 02:50:42.029]  Trump's trying to change that, so are we.
[02:50:42.029 --> 02:50:44.810]  Okay, let's get into this stack right here.
[02:50:46.937 --> 02:50:51.579]  And then I'll go a little bit in the next hour with it, because there's no way we're going to finish up with this right now.
[02:50:51.579 --> 02:50:53.260]  Get that NBC News report ready for me.
[02:50:53.260 --> 02:50:54.981]  Thank you.
[02:50:54.981 --> 02:51:00.843]  And this is why they want my head on a pike, politically.
[02:51:00.843 --> 02:51:04.465]  Here's a story out of News Punch.
[02:51:04.465 --> 02:51:06.986]  And there's new reports that this is being investigated again.
[02:51:06.986 --> 02:51:10.968]  NBC News, Hillary Clinton covered up pedophile ring at State Department.
[02:51:10.968 --> 02:51:13.709]  And you wonder why Matt Lauer, for all his problems, got let go.
[02:51:15.472 --> 02:51:17.657]  He didn't do a good enough job covering this up.
[02:51:17.657 --> 02:51:22.326]  Then I'll get to the latest developments on this front.
[02:51:22.326 --> 02:51:25.653]  Massive pedophile ring busted by cops.
[02:51:25.653 --> 02:51:26.856]  Let's go ahead and roll this clip.
[02:51:28.545 --> 02:51:30.986]  We are following this breaking news out of Washington.
[02:51:30.986 --> 02:51:34.106]  Some serious allegations this morning facing the State Department.
[02:51:34.106 --> 02:51:34.486]  That's right.
[02:51:34.486 --> 02:51:47.569]  According to internal State Department memos, the agency might have called off or intervened in investigation into possibly illegal and inappropriate behavior within its ranks, allegedly to protect jobs and avoid scandals.
[02:51:47.569 --> 02:51:51.110]  This concerns a time that Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.
[02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:54.671]  We want to get right to NBC's chief White House correspondent, Chuck Todd, with the latest.
[02:51:54.671 --> 02:51:55.491]  Chuck, good morning to you.
[02:51:56.011 --> 02:51:56.751]  Good morning, Savannah.
[02:51:56.751 --> 02:52:00.693]  You know there's an old saying in Washington that the cover-up is worse than the crime.
[02:52:00.693 --> 02:52:03.574]  But in this case, both parts of it are disturbing.
[02:52:03.574 --> 02:52:11.078]  Allegations of prostitution and pedophilia and allegations that those crimes were somehow covered up or not looked into.
[02:52:11.078 --> 02:52:22.243]  So the State Department this morning is having to respond to those claims and those investigations of misconduct by State Department officials, including by an ambassador and security agents attached.
[02:52:22.643 --> 02:52:24.788]  To then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
[02:52:24.788 --> 02:52:31.322]  And the allegations are that these investigations were whitewashed, quashed all together, and that those orders came from high up.
[02:52:33.519 --> 02:52:43.324]  NBC News has obtained documents related to ongoing investigations into some disturbing allegations involving State Department personnel and at least one ambassador.
[02:52:43.324 --> 02:52:53.290]  A State Department memo says the ambassador, quote, routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children.
[02:52:53.290 --> 02:53:01.154]  The memo also says a top State Department official directed Department investigators to, quote, cease the investigation into the ambassador's conduct.
[02:53:01.756 --> 02:53:10.443]  It's just one of what another document describes as, quote, several examples of undue influence from top state officials.
[02:53:10.443 --> 02:53:15.446]  Okay, so let's go ahead and get into the breaking news that just came in.
[02:53:15.446 --> 02:53:25.133]  Andrew Gillum said, Hillary, you must be exhausted on Twitter because you've been running through a real Donald Trump small mind for a long time.
[02:53:25.133 --> 02:53:27.135]  So a groveling, sycophantic statement.
[02:53:28.635 --> 02:53:30.036]  And she says, I can handle it.
[02:53:30.036 --> 02:53:31.336]  Bless with stamina.
[02:53:31.336 --> 02:53:35.879]  And thankfully I didn't stay up last night watching InfoWars.
[02:53:35.879 --> 02:53:40.261]  And then they know.
[02:53:40.261 --> 02:53:42.522]  This is the audience that got Trump elected over the top.
[02:53:42.522 --> 02:53:44.323]  We're the reboot of America.
[02:53:44.323 --> 02:53:48.165]  We're the 1776 poll star between myself and Trump.
[02:53:48.165 --> 02:53:49.706]  And it's true.
[02:53:49.706 --> 02:53:51.126]  It's the people.
[02:53:51.126 --> 02:53:57.209]  And then, as they say, the mad prophet of the Tea Party, as they said eight years ago.
[02:53:57.209 --> 02:53:57.790]  And then Trump.
[02:53:58.601 --> 02:54:00.502]  And that's why they want to shut down.
[02:54:00.502 --> 02:54:02.303]  Because we're about to do this.
[02:54:02.303 --> 02:54:03.343]  You just saw that report.
[02:54:03.343 --> 02:54:05.464]  Well, it's back in the news.
[02:54:05.464 --> 02:54:10.386]  It's being investigated because of the Nexivim cult trial.
[02:54:10.386 --> 02:54:22.191]  It's now come out in court that Hillary Clinton was involved and that they had cult members planting stuff on computers so that they could spy on Hillary.
[02:54:22.191 --> 02:54:24.792]  They could spy on each other.
[02:54:24.792 --> 02:54:26.673]  The Brothmans were involved, being spied on.
[02:54:27.898 --> 02:54:36.563]  The cult was getting women into it, saying it was feminist empowerment by worshipping men and starving yourself to death for Lucifer.
[02:54:36.563 --> 02:54:39.385]  And children being kidnapped out of Mexico and disappearing.
[02:54:39.385 --> 02:54:44.708]  Crime boss closing arguments in the NXIVM trial.
[02:54:44.708 --> 02:54:49.131]  Satanism, Mexico child trafficking, Hillary, Schumer and Gillibrand ties.
[02:54:50.984 --> 02:55:01.791]  And it goes on to all of the different child porn featuring Mexican child sex slaves as young as five years old.
[02:55:01.791 --> 02:55:07.816]  There were human breeding rituals that are satanic and human sacrifices.
[02:55:07.816 --> 02:55:14.320]  Do you think the reason who's being branded should be held to the table almost like a sacrifice?
[02:55:14.320 --> 02:55:16.842]  Rainier said to his one-time co-conspirator,
[02:55:18.407 --> 02:55:21.609]  This is a feeder group into the real Satan groups, like I told you.
[02:55:21.609 --> 02:55:28.272]  NXIVM had the financial records of ally Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton's emails.
[02:55:28.272 --> 02:55:33.975]  The sex cult's deep opposition research files and his political enemies included, we now learn, Roger Stone!
[02:55:35.811 --> 02:55:37.172]  That's right.
[02:55:37.172 --> 02:55:38.093]  Came up in trial.
[02:55:38.093 --> 02:55:52.143]  Documents from the archives and shedding light on how the sex cult stored data on top politicians, including Chuck Schumer, whom the cult viewed as a friendly ally, according to ex-employee Frank Parlato and Hillary Clinton.
[02:55:52.143 --> 02:55:54.965]  And this goes on for, this is a 12-page article.
[02:55:54.965 --> 02:55:58.547]  And then this is all over even mainstream news, but it's getting no attention.
[02:55:58.547 --> 02:55:59.068]  And remember,
[02:56:00.914 --> 02:56:05.636]  Stone got implicated in this cult only because they had a bunch of sub-companies.
[02:56:05.636 --> 02:56:07.437]  And they said, we want you to come speak to our group.
[02:56:07.437 --> 02:56:08.798]  Well, Stone's a public speaker.
[02:56:08.798 --> 02:56:09.598]  He came and spoke.
[02:56:09.598 --> 02:56:10.318]  It was really weird.
[02:56:10.318 --> 02:56:11.199]  He thought it was a cult.
[02:56:11.199 --> 02:56:12.359]  Got out of it.
[02:56:12.359 --> 02:56:16.501]  They were doing that, trying to compromise him, but he smelled it and got out.
[02:56:16.501 --> 02:56:26.646]  So Claire W. Brothman, an heiress to the Seagram Company business empire, allegedly implanted a keylogger virus on a computer of her late father, Edgar N. Brothman Sr.
[02:56:27.677 --> 02:56:34.562]  So they always go after rich men's daughters and then get them to do that to their husbands or fathers.
[02:56:34.562 --> 02:56:35.842]  Gotta watch out, folks.
[02:56:35.842 --> 02:56:46.569]  So officials with the ex-NXIVM Corporation could secretly monitor his emails, including his exchanges with world leaders and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to reports.
[02:56:46.569 --> 02:56:49.671]  This is just all a bunch of scum spying on each other.
[02:56:49.671 --> 02:56:56.136]  And again, they're all involved with Epstein and the Lolita Express and just all of it.
[02:56:56.877 --> 02:56:59.240]  It's unbelievable.
[02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:04.928]  And then people like Alan Dershowitz expose it, so they try to frame him with made-up crap.
[02:57:04.928 --> 02:57:06.290]  And that ties into Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:57:06.290 --> 02:57:07.792]  It's all made up.
[02:57:07.792 --> 02:57:11.036]  So if you expose it, they say you're part of it.
[02:57:11.036 --> 02:57:13.380]  It's just incredible.
[02:57:14.482 --> 02:57:16.484]  And here's some of the target files and who they went after.
[02:57:16.484 --> 02:57:18.305]  They were targeting Brothman and Rothschilds.
[02:57:18.305 --> 02:57:27.152]  Can you imagine being Rothschilds and Brothmans with all their tens of billions of dollars just laying around and all the people trying to get into it and all the rats and all the leftist crap?
[02:57:27.152 --> 02:57:28.053]  It's just, what a nightmare.
[02:57:28.053 --> 02:57:32.597]  Why don't you just bring Jesus into your life and stop devil worshipping and everything will be okay.
[02:57:32.597 --> 02:57:33.618]  You know?
[02:57:33.618 --> 02:57:35.579]  Oh, I haven't even scratched the surface, sorry.
[02:57:35.579 --> 02:57:37.201]  There's a lot more coming up.
[02:57:37.201 --> 02:57:41.904]  The UN's own admission that Hillary's operatives run child kidnapping rings.
[02:57:41.904 --> 02:57:43.226]  The Associated Press reports.
[02:57:47.672 --> 02:57:57.100]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[02:57:57.100 --> 02:58:08.110]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:58:08.490 --> 02:58:14.433]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee beans.

[02:58:46.570 --> 02:58:49.252]  I want to be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[02:58:49.252 --> 02:58:51.053]  We're going into the season of war.
[02:58:51.053 --> 02:58:57.137]  And they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[02:58:57.137 --> 02:59:00.800]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[02:59:00.800 --> 02:59:01.720]  We need to end here.
[02:59:01.720 --> 02:59:03.041]  We need to be provisioned.
[02:59:03.041 --> 02:59:07.184]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[02:59:07.244 --> 02:59:11.489]  Honestly, I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[02:59:11.489 --> 02:59:13.431]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[02:59:13.431 --> 02:59:18.416]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[02:59:18.416 --> 02:59:21.720]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[02:59:21.720 --> 02:59:22.561]  I need gas.
[02:59:22.561 --> 02:59:24.083]  I need ammo politically now!
[02:59:24.463 --> 02:59:31.886]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[02:59:31.886 --> 02:59:33.286]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[02:59:33.286 --> 02:59:40.309]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[02:59:40.309 --> 02:59:41.309]  You have my commitment.
[02:59:41.309 --> 02:59:49.192]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[02:59:49.192 --> 02:59:51.813]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.521 --> 03:00:09.582]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:09.582 --> 03:00:12.923]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.923 --> 03:00:17.464]  They can't trump our providence if we take action and take our birthright.
[03:00:17.464 --> 03:00:18.504]  I'm exercising mine.
[03:00:18.504 --> 03:00:22.125]  What about you?
[03:00:22.125 --> 03:00:24.105]  Next segment, it's so sad.
[03:00:24.105 --> 03:00:28.507]  They're canceling the Clinton Broadway show months early.
[03:00:28.507 --> 03:00:29.987]  No one's coming to their events.
[03:00:31.718 --> 03:00:36.304]  And Hillary's attacked me and says I'm the operating system for Trump.
[03:00:36.304 --> 03:00:38.426]  No.
[03:00:38.426 --> 03:00:42.451]  I simply rediscovered America and freedom.
[03:00:42.451 --> 03:00:48.819]  Packaged it in just a brown paper bag cover.
[03:00:48.819 --> 03:00:49.480]  And people want it.
[03:00:52.998 --> 03:00:58.000]  Over you, whose first lawyer job was representing child rapists?
[03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.421]  And I don't mean just people accused of it, and it's not clear.
[03:01:00.421 --> 03:01:04.743]  I mean brutalizing people.
[03:01:04.743 --> 03:01:08.984]  NBC News, Hillary Clinton covered up pedophile ring at the State Department.
[03:01:08.984 --> 03:01:11.325]  Hillary attacked me on Twitter last night.
[03:01:11.325 --> 03:01:16.107]  YouTube deletes channel of Spain's populist Vox Party.
[03:01:16.107 --> 03:01:21.590]  Crime Boss, closing arguments in the ex-NXIVM trial.
[03:01:21.590 --> 03:01:22.510]  Nixxiom trial.
[03:01:23.857 --> 03:01:27.120]  Oh, and look!
[03:01:27.120 --> 03:01:29.882]  New Life Children's Refuge case.
[03:01:29.882 --> 03:01:30.763]  Even from Wikipedia.
[03:01:30.763 --> 03:01:32.785]  Even the left can't whitewash it.
[03:01:32.785 --> 03:01:42.453]  Laura Silsby, who got convicted of child sex trafficking out of Haiti for the Clinton Foundation.
[03:01:42.453 --> 03:01:43.194]  Well, guess what?
[03:01:43.194 --> 03:01:45.916]  She changed her name.
[03:01:45.916 --> 03:01:49.880]  And she now runs the group that controls Amber Alert for Missing Kids.
[03:01:49.880 --> 03:01:51.361]  That's a key position, isn't it?
[03:01:52.634 --> 03:01:56.015]  Right where you need to be.
[03:01:56.015 --> 03:02:00.456]  The Clinton-Sillsbee trafficking scandal and how the media attempted to cover it up.
[03:02:00.456 --> 03:02:03.017]  Zero Hedge.
[03:02:03.017 --> 03:02:04.458]  Boy, they deposed me and Sandy Hook.
[03:02:04.458 --> 03:02:06.018]  They want to know all about Zero Hedge.
[03:02:06.018 --> 03:02:07.118]  Who runs it?
[03:02:07.118 --> 03:02:07.899]  Who's behind it?
[03:02:07.899 --> 03:02:09.019]  And I don't know.
[03:02:09.019 --> 03:02:14.661]  I just know they don't like pedophiles and they're badass.
[03:02:14.661 --> 03:02:18.362]  And I just know it's good to know I got other folks out there like me.
[03:02:18.362 --> 03:02:21.563]  Feels good to not be the last of the Mohicans.
[03:02:23.618 --> 03:02:26.079]  Oh, we're not the last, we're the rebirth, all of you.
[03:02:26.079 --> 03:02:28.840]  You can be black, you can be white, you can be brown, you can be pink.
[03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:32.681]  You can be old, you can be young, you can be male, female.
[03:02:32.681 --> 03:02:42.184]  If you believe in protecting children's innocence, you believe in humanity, you believe in God, you believe in a future, and you're not anti-human, well then, we're on the same team.
[03:02:42.184 --> 03:02:45.966]  Clinton brokers deal over Haiti orphans' abductions!
[03:02:45.966 --> 03:02:48.306]  Wow!
[03:02:48.306 --> 03:02:50.987]  Wow!
[03:02:50.987 --> 03:02:53.208]  That's mainstream news, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:02:57.793 --> 03:02:59.894]  And then it goes through all of it right here.
[03:02:59.894 --> 03:03:05.778]  Clinton Foundation tied to child trafficker Laura Silsby.
[03:03:05.778 --> 03:03:07.519]  Trying to sneak kids out of Haiti.
[03:03:07.519 --> 03:03:09.920]  God knows where they'd go.
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:14.763]  Laura Silsby was convicted of kidnapping 33 Haitian children who had families.
[03:03:14.763 --> 03:03:18.505]  She changed her name to Laura Gaylor.
[03:03:18.505 --> 03:03:20.806]  Now works for the U.S.
[03:03:20.806 --> 03:03:21.427]  government.
[03:03:21.427 --> 03:03:25.429]  And she got a job running the system that gives the index info to Amber Alert.
[03:03:26.957 --> 03:03:36.244]  She works for Amber Alerts as a service, which means she knows how to locate those missing children or who might be looking for them.
[03:03:36.244 --> 03:03:40.627]  Important place to be after you're a convicted child trafficker.
[03:03:40.627 --> 03:03:46.812]  But hey, a lot of kids flowing in now, those open borders, a lot of fresh hamburger.
[03:03:46.812 --> 03:03:49.935]  The Global Intelligence Files.
[03:03:49.935 --> 03:03:51.095]  Legal advisor to U.S.
[03:03:51.095 --> 03:03:52.917]  Haiti missionaries arrested.
[03:03:55.629 --> 03:03:58.851]  And guess what they were arrested for, can you guess?
[03:03:58.851 --> 03:04:01.813]  Human trafficking of children.
[03:04:01.813 --> 03:04:03.715]  But there's a new article out.
[03:04:03.715 --> 03:04:07.137]  This is being promoted by mainstream media and the Huffington Post.
[03:04:07.137 --> 03:04:17.364]  Children can handle the kink of pride parades, say SJW parents when they let their little kids get out there and see naked men and their genitals hanging out.
[03:04:17.364 --> 03:04:20.446]  Things I won't even show adults here on this show.
[03:04:20.446 --> 03:04:22.868]  But the men come over and rub their
[03:04:24.201 --> 03:04:28.524]  Erect genitals on little kids and everyone howls with pleasure.
[03:04:28.524 --> 03:04:35.408]  The power of exercising pedophilia in the open makes Satan smile upon them.
[03:04:35.408 --> 03:04:36.548]  AP exclusive!
[03:04:36.548 --> 03:04:40.911]  UN child sex ring left victims but no arrests, including many deaths.
[03:04:40.911 --> 03:04:43.112]  Go read the 11-page report.
[03:04:43.112 --> 03:04:47.275]  Oh, top Clinton donor in Arkansas arrested for child porn distribution.
[03:04:47.275 --> 03:04:48.415]  That's mainstream media.
[03:04:48.415 --> 03:04:50.797]  BigLeaguePolitics.com also reporting on it.
[03:04:50.797 --> 03:04:52.318]  Oh, and Trump's busting the pedophiles.
[03:04:52.318 --> 03:04:52.818]  That makes them mad.
[03:04:55.057 --> 03:05:02.467]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[03:05:02.467 --> 03:05:10.337]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[03:05:16.124 --> 03:05:17.825]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[03:05:17.825 --> 03:05:19.046]  This is racketeering.
[03:05:19.046 --> 03:05:20.167]  This is cartels.
[03:05:20.167 --> 03:05:22.589]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[03:05:22.589 --> 03:05:24.450]  We need it now.
[03:05:24.450 --> 03:05:26.151]  You can take on Big Ten.
[03:05:26.151 --> 03:05:35.098]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[03:05:35.098 --> 03:05:43.144]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[03:05:43.144 --> 03:05:44.005]  The way to fight back
[03:05:44.645 --> 03:05:49.467]  is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[03:05:49.467 --> 03:05:53.229]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[03:06:05.598 --> 03:06:10.002]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.002 --> 03:06:15.226]  You know, one time I sang this to my Dodge Challenger.
[03:06:15.226 --> 03:06:19.670]  Roaring down the road with Dave Mustaine, here in Austin, Texas.
[03:06:19.670 --> 03:06:21.312]  And we heard Dave's got throat cancer.
[03:06:21.312 --> 03:06:23.574]  I need to call him and pray for him.
[03:06:23.574 --> 03:06:26.856]  But I sang this whole song with him on the radio.
[03:06:26.856 --> 03:06:28.258]  Going to a show!
[03:06:28.258 --> 03:06:31.741]  I was better than going to one of his concerts.
[03:06:40.197 --> 03:06:45.219]  Broken bones.
[03:06:45.219 --> 03:06:47.360]  Yep.
[03:06:47.360 --> 03:06:50.361]  Getting took.
[03:06:50.361 --> 03:06:54.042]  I'm here to tell you, it's harder than it looks.
[03:06:54.042 --> 03:06:58.944]  Long way to the top if you want to bring down world government.
[03:06:58.944 --> 03:07:02.506]  We're getting real close.
[03:07:02.506 --> 03:07:06.107]  Hillary Clinton tweeted out last night about Trump's event.
[03:07:09.108 --> 03:07:11.811]  She said she can handle it.
[03:07:11.811 --> 03:07:17.558]  Blessed with stamina and thankfully I didn't stay up late last night watching InfoWars.
[03:07:17.558 --> 03:07:25.447]  But she meant by Trump's re-election launch that was a gigantic extravaganza.
[03:07:25.447 --> 03:07:27.089]  Woo!
[03:07:27.089 --> 03:07:27.950]  They are pissed.
[03:07:29.191 --> 03:07:31.072]  I'll show you the next segment, or maybe now.
[03:07:31.072 --> 03:07:35.394]  Nobody's coming to their events, maybe a couple thousand, even when the tickets are free.
[03:07:35.394 --> 03:07:46.939]  Nobody's going to their Clinton play that they have in New York that the whole media's been pushing and promoting on Broadway.
[03:07:46.939 --> 03:07:50.221]  That's been cancelled a month early.
[03:07:50.221 --> 03:07:52.862]  Nobody, ladies and gentlemen, nobody likes Hillary.
[03:07:52.862 --> 03:07:54.222]  Nobody's visiting with her.
[03:07:54.222 --> 03:07:55.923]  Nobody's covering what Biden does.
[03:07:55.923 --> 03:07:56.803]  Biden might get 200, 300 people out.
[03:07:59.087 --> 03:08:00.808]  They're so scared.
[03:08:00.808 --> 03:08:10.415]  And so she sees Trump, ladies and gentlemen, and what happened last night, as so incredibly scary.
[03:08:10.415 --> 03:08:13.797]  And she accurately knows that it's InfoWars.
[03:08:13.797 --> 03:08:19.521]  They have a clip in there where CNN pulls out and cuts the V because they're chanting, CNN sucks.
[03:08:19.521 --> 03:08:22.983]  And they don't know what to do.
[03:08:22.983 --> 03:08:25.625]  Isn't that just beautiful?
[03:08:25.625 --> 03:08:27.206]  Now, Paul Watson,
[03:08:28.442 --> 03:08:30.924]  Did a report.
[03:08:30.924 --> 03:08:32.445]  We're gonna go ahead and roll right now.
[03:08:32.445 --> 03:08:33.986]  We'll talk about it after the break.
[03:08:33.986 --> 03:08:36.528]  The early accurate predictions of Cyberpunk.
[03:08:36.528 --> 03:08:38.049]  Here it is.
[03:08:38.049 --> 03:08:45.974]  Cyberpunk 2020 was a 1988 tabletop role-playing game, the second version of which was set in a fictional 2020.
[03:08:45.974 --> 03:08:55.321]  The game takes place in a dystopian future where multiculturalism has failed and America is, quote, divided by class, race, and economics.
[03:08:55.501 --> 03:09:00.945]  The main themes of the game pertain to futuristic transport, weaponry, and transhumanism.
[03:09:00.945 --> 03:09:08.350]  But it's the cultural and sociological tropes featured in the game that make some of its predictions eerily prescient.
[03:09:08.350 --> 03:09:11.752]  Again, to emphasize, this RPG was originally created 30 years ago.
[03:09:12.793 --> 03:09:21.182]  And in an updated 1994 rulebook, we find this stunningly pinpoint prophecy about life in 2020.
[03:09:21.182 --> 03:09:23.244]  Diversity and unity.
[03:09:23.244 --> 03:09:32.934]  It is now accepted among historical scholars that in the decades before the collapse, America suffered from the sickness of racism and cultural identity.
[03:09:32.934 --> 03:09:35.036]  Everyone wanted to be seen as special.
[03:09:35.316 --> 03:09:42.303]  Every group had to be equal to or preferably better than its neighbours and fought to protect its special rights.
[03:09:42.303 --> 03:09:48.910]  If anyone had something that someone else wanted, they were painted as racist, sexist, elitist or worse.
[03:09:48.910 --> 03:09:58.560]  This divisive, me-first attitude eventually tore the fabric of American culture apart and caused it to self-destruct in a fireball of competing ideologies.
[03:09:58.840 --> 03:10:02.123]  None of which truly recognized each other's validity.
[03:10:02.123 --> 03:10:05.646]  Diversity led inexorably to anarchy.
[03:10:05.646 --> 03:10:10.530]  Wow, I guess the designers of Cyberpunk 2020 must have been racists.
[03:10:10.530 --> 03:10:12.972]  Yeah, actually it was created by this base black dude.
[03:10:12.972 --> 03:10:17.036]  For anyone who has followed modernity's obsession with identity politics.
[03:10:17.156 --> 03:10:25.401]  And the sanctification of victimhood as a form of special status exploited to impose political and cultural hegemony.
[03:10:25.401 --> 03:10:31.124]  That's a creepily prophetic observation, given that it was made nearly three decades ago.
[03:10:31.124 --> 03:10:35.446]  But that wasn't the only prediction that Cyberpunk 2020 got banged on the money.
[03:10:35.446 --> 03:10:45.792]  The game's 1988 rulebook predicted, quote, a Great Britain swamped by mass immigration, leading to streets almost explosively as dangerous
[03:10:46.352 --> 03:10:48.054]  As the United States.
[03:10:48.054 --> 03:10:50.116]  Hmm, that kind of rings a bell.
[03:10:50.116 --> 03:10:54.521]  A wave of stabbings have given London a higher murder rate than New York City.
[03:10:54.521 --> 03:10:58.366]  Every 14 minutes, there's a knife crime across England and Wales.
[03:11:02.827 --> 03:11:07.568]  Knife crime is at a near record high, with more than 40 blade offences every day in London.
[03:11:07.568 --> 03:11:12.910]  If your child is involved in a gang, and there's nowhere for him to hide, you take him back to Africa.
[03:11:12.910 --> 03:11:14.610]  You know, it's safer there than it is in London.
[03:11:14.610 --> 03:11:22.412]  When your parents send your child back, it's a risk you're taking, but unfortunately some parents feel like it's also a risk leaving their kids in the streets of London.
[03:11:22.552 --> 03:11:23.353]  Diversity is a strength.
[03:11:23.353 --> 03:11:33.239]  The game also predicted the rise of the, quote, Me First worldview, which is now exemplified by exploding narcissism driven by social media addiction.
[03:11:33.239 --> 03:11:50.190]  The RPG also foresaw a future in which, quote, entertainment has become generic and a conglomeration of TV networks emerged to deliver hundreds of channels that produce a product which is, quote, bland, mindless, and caters to the lowest possible denominator.
[03:11:50.270 --> 03:11:52.272]  That kind of rings a bell, too!
[03:11:52.272 --> 03:11:57.516]  In a successful attempt to distract the population from the dystopia that surrounds them.
[03:11:57.516 --> 03:12:05.163]  In the game, the so-called medianets ensure that every apartment has access to this idiocracy-style mass entertainment.
[03:12:05.163 --> 03:12:08.686]  The game also predicted the decline of traditional media platforms.
[03:12:08.806 --> 03:12:19.237]  With old-fashioned newspapers and print magazines fading into oblivion, the original cyberpunk game was inspired by a 1986 sci-fi novel called Hardwired.
[03:12:19.237 --> 03:12:26.985]  In Hardwired, and by extension cyberpunk, ruthless corporations have created vast monopolies, have amassed more power than countries.
[03:12:27.606 --> 03:12:30.288]  And everyone is completely dependent on them.
[03:12:30.288 --> 03:12:48.140]  According to Cyberpunk's 1988 rulebook, in 2020, quote, dissenting opinions and independent productions are usually buried under an avalanche of media hype, or worse, co-opted or destroyed by the vicious competitive practices of the major media corps.
[03:12:48.140 --> 03:12:52.884]  That definitely reminds me of something, just can't quite put my finger on it.
[03:12:52.884 --> 03:12:54.065]  Imagine this for a second.
[03:12:54.865 --> 03:12:59.310]  One man with total control of billions of people's stolen data.
[03:12:59.310 --> 03:13:02.874]  All their secrets, their lives, their futures.
[03:13:02.874 --> 03:13:05.216]  I owe it all to Spectre.
[03:13:05.216 --> 03:13:09.580]  Spectre showed me that whoever controls the data, controls the future.
[03:13:09.580 --> 03:13:12.043]  But at least it's not that bad yet, right?
[03:13:12.043 --> 03:13:16.848]  We can still express dissenting opinions without being silenced by Megacorps.
[03:13:17.088 --> 03:13:27.403]  At least when someone tried to post about Cyberpunk 2020 on Reddit under the title, in the original Cyberpunk 2020 rulebook, diversity was the downfall of America.
[03:13:27.403 --> 03:13:29.666]  The post wasn't immediately removed.
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:31.441]  Right?
[03:13:31.441 --> 03:13:33.442]  Oh, it was immediately removed.
[03:13:33.442 --> 03:13:55.736]  A big Cyberpunk 2020 theme is augmentation of the body with cyber technology, which in turn causes an ensuing loss of humanity as the characters become more synthetic, which was another adept example of prescient social commentary on our increasing addiction to smartphones and the wider body modification transhumanist movement.
[03:13:55.776 --> 03:14:02.908]  The Stockholm subway system also has plans to modify their turnstiles so they can be opened with implanted chips.
[03:14:02.908 --> 03:14:06.754]  Over 3,500 Swedes now have microchips under their skin.
[03:14:06.754 --> 03:14:07.556]  You got the chip.
[03:14:09.139 --> 03:14:18.804]  According to the 1988 rulebook, quote, as each new technological enhancement slammed into place, a sort of cultural techno-shock set in.
[03:14:18.804 --> 03:14:31.031]  In a 2006 update to the game called Cyberpunk 23X, corruption of the internet has made, quote, all data intangible and recent recorded history is in doubt.
[03:14:31.331 --> 03:14:40.081]  Again, this speaks to the contemporary lurch towards internet censorship and digital buck-burning in addition to fears over fake news.
[03:14:40.081 --> 03:14:47.329]  This update also accurately predicted the rise of deepfake technology misleading people about the nature of reality.
[03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:51.712]  And the power of memes to influence culture and society.
[03:14:51.712 --> 03:15:00.918]  Cyberpunk 2077, a new video game starring Keanu Reeves, based on the original RPG, is set to be released next year.
[03:15:00.918 --> 03:15:06.421]  In the game, the metropolis of Night City is divided up into six different regions.
[03:15:06.421 --> 03:15:11.624]  One is the domain of elitists, another of criminal gangs, and another of immigrants.
[03:15:11.624 --> 03:15:16.307]  In other words, diversity and integration appears to have failed.
[03:15:16.307 --> 03:15:17.268]  Segregation.
[03:15:17.708 --> 03:15:18.949]  is a way of life.
[03:15:18.949 --> 03:15:27.336]  And nearly a year before the game is even released, we're already seeing a progressive backlash to Cyberpunk 2077.
[03:15:27.336 --> 03:15:39.345]  In this tweet, a leftist expresses his outrage at a certain level of disgust expressed by characters in the game to the sight of a heavily technologically augmented naked woman in a bathtub.
[03:15:39.505 --> 03:15:49.278]  Although the objective in the game is to rescue the woman, she is seen as profane, unclean, and not fully human because she is, quote, augmented too much.
[03:15:53.325 --> 03:15:54.546]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.546 --> 03:15:58.469]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.469 --> 03:15:59.990]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:02.953]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:02.953 --> 03:16:08.517]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.517 --> 03:16:09.718]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.718 --> 03:16:12.660]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.660 --> 03:16:14.882]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:14.882 --> 03:16:19.325]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:19.325 --> 03:16:21.627]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:23.234 --> 03:16:24.495]  Maybe not today.
[03:16:24.495 --> 03:16:25.776]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[03:16:25.776 --> 03:16:29.518]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[03:16:29.518 --> 03:16:30.599]  Forget bunkers.
[03:16:30.599 --> 03:16:32.420]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[03:16:32.420 --> 03:16:34.141]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[03:17:14.008 --> 03:17:15.430]  No, not just pillows.

[03:17:57.617 --> 03:17:59.379]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:17:59.379 --> 03:18:10.670]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:18:11.431 --> 03:18:20.618]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:18:20.618 --> 03:18:26.403]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:18:26.403 --> 03:18:31.687]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:18:31.687 --> 03:18:33.929]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:18:34.289 --> 03:18:35.990]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:45.993]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:18:45.993 --> 03:18:48.653]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:18:48.653 --> 03:18:53.355]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:18:58.962 --> 03:19:01.324]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:19:57.199 --> 03:20:05.249]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:05.249 --> 03:20:08.713]  Well, everybody said about the bed, bed, bed, bed, bed.
[03:20:21.164 --> 03:20:21.924]  Welcome back.
[03:20:21.924 --> 03:20:26.187]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:20:26.187 --> 03:20:30.229]  Bellie Weaver was at the big Trump mega rally last night.
[03:20:30.229 --> 03:20:33.430]  Infowars.com reporter, she'll be joining us for the last segment.
[03:20:33.430 --> 03:20:41.935]  But I wanted to start every day when I have time, singling out amazing YouTubers and other people online that are really breaking down some amazing stuff.
[03:20:43.720 --> 03:20:45.482]  This video was produced a couple years ago.
[03:20:45.482 --> 03:20:47.104]  It's only got 800,000 views.
[03:20:47.104 --> 03:20:49.367]  It deserves 10 million views.
[03:20:49.367 --> 03:20:55.133]  And it was put out by Black Pigeon Speaks.
[03:20:56.303 --> 03:20:58.124]  It's the end game.
[03:20:58.124 --> 03:21:00.285]  Why the West is lost.
[03:21:00.285 --> 03:21:05.528]  And it's from a liberal, historic perspective, and it's actually pretty accurate.
[03:21:05.528 --> 03:21:08.509]  Now, the Black Pigeon Speaks was banned off YouTube for a week or so.
[03:21:08.509 --> 03:21:10.810]  It was a big backlash.
[03:21:10.810 --> 03:21:18.514]  They put them back up, but they're laying out the history of countries, the West, why the West was special, and why it's under so much attack.
[03:21:18.514 --> 03:21:23.297]  It'll take this segment and part of the next segment to get to this report, but it's really important, so here it is.
[03:21:24.441 --> 03:21:44.454]  Odious cretins like Antifa, the Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco, children having sex reassignment surgery, dogs having sex reassignment surgery for that matter, bug chasing and gift-giving, Miley Cyrus, massive uncontrolled immigration of cultural groups that are totally incompatible.
[03:21:44.454 --> 03:21:50.959]  We tell ourselves we are being vibrantly enriched when Rotherham, Orlando, and Cologne happened.
[03:21:50.959 --> 03:21:54.121]  What kind of civilization have we inherited?
[03:21:54.561 --> 03:21:59.868]  Well, what we are doing is, in fact, living the endgame of Western civilization.
[03:21:59.868 --> 03:22:04.033]  This is the end result of the West's unique experiment.
[03:22:04.033 --> 03:22:10.841]  An experiment that many think has gone wrong, but, in fact, is going totally as should be expected.
[03:22:11.221 --> 03:22:26.568]  In the next several minutes, I will explain why the transgender, anti-fa, children on hormone blockers, and those intentionally trying to contract HIV, the bug chasers, are in fact the true inheritors of Western civilization.
[03:22:27.088 --> 03:22:33.934]  The genesis of this video was around a few pints at the local pub with a friend that goes by the moniker TheRenegadeOfFunk.
[03:22:33.934 --> 03:22:37.478]  Please find a link to his blog and Twitter in the description.
[03:22:37.478 --> 03:22:48.007]  Well, what we were doing was doing as we usually do, talking about a plethora of abstract topics, when he brought up a book called The Troublesome Inheritance, written by Nicholas Wade.
[03:22:48.007 --> 03:22:51.611]  So what follows is basically a rehash of that conversation.
[03:22:52.131 --> 03:23:01.279]  So, the key or foundational understanding that underpins any civilization is that the state is superior to one's own tribe.
[03:23:01.279 --> 03:23:09.667]  This applies to the Sumerians, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, the Romans, as well as it does to modern Americans.
[03:23:09.667 --> 03:23:10.788]  So, going back in time,
[03:23:11.468 --> 03:23:30.048]  After the collapse of Rome, Europe was a fractured patchwork of small kingdoms, while the Chinese of the same period had built a government based on meritocracy, at least in its administration, while, for example, the Islamic world wed religion with the state in a theocracy of the caliphate.
[03:23:30.048 --> 03:23:30.829]  All societies
[03:23:31.189 --> 03:23:31.349]  I think?
[03:23:46.206 --> 03:23:50.869]  I'm going to say that the Japanese, Indians, Chinese, or Arabs didn't have law.
[03:23:50.869 --> 03:23:57.853]  But the key difference is that the laws were never seen as superior or could countermand the ruling class.
[03:23:57.853 --> 03:24:01.795]  In that, whoever ruled made the laws and everyone else obeyed.
[03:24:01.795 --> 03:24:07.198]  For a modern example of this, look no further than Kim Jong-un of North Korea.
[03:24:07.198 --> 03:24:14.342]  But what the West created in terms of the rule of law was revolutionary and superior to even Roman law.
[03:24:14.722 --> 03:24:28.034]  The Magna Carta was the starting point of the uniquely Western adaptation known as liberalism, the concept of which is very difficult and hard to pin down, but is best understood by looking at the sum of its parts.
[03:24:28.034 --> 03:24:34.019]  It is anti-tribal or anti-ingroup, as authority is abstracted away from local family groups.
[03:24:34.019 --> 03:24:35.741]  The rule of law takes precedence.
[03:24:36.281 --> 03:24:39.203]  Over, even in theory, the ruling class.
[03:24:39.203 --> 03:24:41.845]  The rule of law also applies to all groups.
[03:24:41.845 --> 03:24:45.288]  Thus, in time, it eventually becomes secular.
[03:24:45.288 --> 03:24:52.473]  And secular law leads to individual rights, as well as, and I might add, undermining religious authority.
[03:24:52.973 --> 03:24:58.454]  As liberalism evolved, representative government more often than not became the standard.
[03:24:58.454 --> 03:25:02.875]  And in time, as we have seen, that government becomes progressive.
[03:25:02.875 --> 03:25:13.058]  When liberalism reaches its apex, it then begins to deconstruct its own traditions and society, intentionally generating new norms and standards.
[03:25:13.058 --> 03:25:14.558]  This is where we are today.
[03:25:15.018 --> 03:25:25.026]  In Wade's book, he presented clear and convincing evidence that human evolution has been, in his words, copious, regional, and recent.
[03:25:25.026 --> 03:25:32.812]  We can observe huge shifts in intelligence, psychology, and behavior in as little as the past 20 generations.
[03:25:32.812 --> 03:25:34.833]  Consider the reality of medieval life.
[03:25:34.833 --> 03:25:37.555]  It was nasty, brutish, and short.
[03:25:37.555 --> 03:25:44.641]  For entertainment, people would gather in the town square to watch grisly torture executions or fill large containers with
[03:25:44.821 --> 03:25:45.521]  I don't know.
[03:26:04.867 --> 03:26:09.150]  Murder rates declined as people became less tribal and formed nation-states.
[03:26:09.150 --> 03:26:10.531]  Etiquette improved.
[03:26:10.531 --> 03:26:12.813]  And the concept of chivalry was born.
[03:26:12.813 --> 03:26:20.399]  And it should be noted that despite the pedantic prostrations of the evil that is Christianity, it did help very much in this regard.
[03:26:21.067 --> 03:26:29.536]  As people became less tribal, they began to outsource violence to the state, seeing it as a legitimate arbiter of conflicts.
[03:26:29.536 --> 03:26:41.008]  The triumph of Parliament over King in England thus led to the Bill of Rights in 1689, which was followed by, quite predictably in hindsight, the American and French Revolutions.
[03:26:41.628 --> 03:26:46.671]  Liberalism led to more individual rights and it led to capitalism.
[03:26:46.671 --> 03:26:55.855]  Europe not only began the great exploration of our planet but also into the nature of reality with the birth of modern science.
[03:26:55.855 --> 03:27:03.059]  All of this propelled the Western world to become wealthier and more importantly the dominant civilization for the first time
[03:27:03.619 --> 03:27:04.639]  Globally.
[03:27:04.639 --> 03:27:08.141]  There was nowhere that the West did not stand high.
[03:27:08.141 --> 03:27:15.163]  And through the same force, liberalism, ideas about the condition of man came into question.
[03:27:15.163 --> 03:27:20.925]  The West abolished slavery in its colonies, but it also forced the rest of the world to give up the practice.
[03:27:20.925 --> 03:27:27.968]  While slavery still exists, of course, in many parts of the world to this day, mostly in the Middle East and Africa, the West, and only the West,
[03:27:28.368 --> 03:27:37.471]  came to see the inherent inhumanity of chattel slavery as it came to believe in the idea of the dignity of all men.
[03:27:37.471 --> 03:27:45.193]  And the key turning point, which if you look at the progression of liberalism, was the idea of egalitarianism.
[03:27:45.193 --> 03:27:52.135]  At first, this would be extended racially, to a point, as well as between the genders, again, to a point.
[03:27:52.615 --> 03:28:00.059]  After liberalism destroyed slavery, the next target in the progressive era was women's rights, which led to the 19th Amendment to the U.S.
[03:28:00.059 --> 03:28:01.279]  Constitution.
[03:28:01.279 --> 03:28:03.480]  Not so coincidentally, however... Alright, folks.
[03:28:03.480 --> 03:28:05.701]  We're gonna go to break, come back with a powerful conclusion.
[03:28:05.701 --> 03:28:06.502]  Here's breaking news.
[03:28:06.502 --> 03:28:08.282]  The NXVM trial.
[03:28:08.282 --> 03:28:14.105]  Leader convicted after trial exposed sex cults, sordid inner workings, connections to the Clintons.
[03:28:14.105 --> 03:28:16.206]  That is even the New York Times.
[03:28:16.206 --> 03:28:17.867]  It's all coming out.
[03:28:18.792 --> 03:28:21.774]  Get ready, we'll be back, and finish up with this powerful report.
[03:28:21.774 --> 03:28:29.280]  Now this is from a liberal's perspective, and there is the classical liberal movement, but that came out of a true expression of Christianity.
[03:28:30.325 --> 03:28:35.731]  From the Christian ethos of love those as yourself or as your brother or lay down your life for others.
[03:28:35.731 --> 03:28:43.540]  But this is from a liberal that then gets into the true cancer of the left that is destroying the liberal movement of say a Thomas Jefferson.
[03:28:43.540 --> 03:28:43.980]  We'll be back.
[03:28:43.980 --> 03:28:47.544]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:28:47.544 --> 03:28:48.986]  Tomorrow's news today.

[03:32:50.388 --> 03:32:51.869]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:10.578 --> 03:33:18.022]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[03:33:18.022 --> 03:33:25.186]  Infowars.com.
[03:33:25.186 --> 03:33:31.449]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:34.452 --> 03:33:49.040]  Well, the NXIVM Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, sex cult, just like Weiner and all the rest of it, or Epstein, or Bill Clinton, it's all going down in spectacular flames.
[03:33:49.040 --> 03:33:55.704]  NXIVM trial, leader convicted after trial exposed, sex cults sorted into workings.
[03:33:55.704 --> 03:33:59.586]  We'll talk about it with Millie Weaver in the next segment, but finishing up with the great work.
[03:34:00.834 --> 03:34:11.279]  of the endgame why the West is lost by black pigeon speaks from a historical liberal perspective that minus not giving Christianity credit is very accurate.
[03:34:11.279 --> 03:34:12.459]  Here it is.
[03:34:12.459 --> 03:34:23.684]  Once women were enfranchised the concept of the welfare state was born and the welfare state is the culmination of marrying individualism with egalitarianism.
[03:34:23.684 --> 03:34:30.187]  This is a profound and very anti-ingroup secular idea that is again uniquely
[03:34:30.467 --> 03:34:31.368]  Western.
[03:34:31.368 --> 03:34:33.830]  Universal man-made salvation.
[03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:43.297]  The expansion of the franchise relates to this idea, as does the enshrinement of democracy as the ultimate political ideal.
[03:34:43.297 --> 03:34:51.404]  Liberalism has also led to another very important, and in most other societies, alien concept, that of the immigrant.
[03:34:51.864 --> 03:34:54.007]  An immigrant is distinct from a foreigner.
[03:34:54.007 --> 03:34:58.173]  A foreigner goes to another country and lives there as an outsider.
[03:34:58.173 --> 03:35:07.687]  An immigrant is seen as having equal standing with the natives, even though having no ties, history, and at times very different worldviews than the dominant
[03:35:08.367 --> 03:35:25.936]  And this is important because despite what vacuous little girls playing house and pretending that the West's concept of immigration is universal and that they can just walk into a non-Western country and be part of that in-group, well, the reality is much different.
[03:35:26.656 --> 03:35:31.458]  Societies throughout the world do not have the concept of the immigrant.
[03:35:31.458 --> 03:35:34.919]  Rather, they cling to the concept of a foreigner.
[03:35:34.919 --> 03:35:43.503]  For non-Western societies that have retained their ethnic tribalism, which is most, the immigrant is still a shaky concept.
[03:35:43.923 --> 03:35:48.867]  Ethnic Koreans that have lived in Japan for generations are still considered outsiders.
[03:35:48.867 --> 03:35:51.609]  Zainichi is the term that is applied to them.
[03:35:51.609 --> 03:36:00.696]  The concept of in-group and out-group is to this day the way most societies operate, from Muslims to Australian Aborigines and all points in between.
[03:36:00.696 --> 03:36:07.121]  Immigration was never a concept until, that is, other societies learned the idea from the West.
[03:36:07.521 --> 03:36:10.983]  Capitalism as well feeds on immigration.
[03:36:10.983 --> 03:36:14.205]  It did do in the 19th century just as it does today.
[03:36:14.205 --> 03:36:16.907]  Influxes of Irish and Italians into the U.S.
[03:36:16.907 --> 03:36:21.689]  were just as disruptive as Mexicans are today, but both groups assimilated.
[03:36:21.689 --> 03:36:25.732]  And while America did change, its core of liberalism persisted.
[03:36:26.112 --> 03:36:38.356]  The next step in the evolution of liberalism came after the horror of the First and Second World Wars, which in turn led to civilizational exhaustion and civilizational self-doubt in the West.
[03:36:38.356 --> 03:36:49.239]  It was the upending of established thinking with regards to empire that allowed the process of decolonization to go relatively peacefully after the end of the Second World War.
[03:36:49.759 --> 03:36:58.250]  No longer was it Europe's burden to civilize the world, the new paradigm was one of rigid egalitarianism for all.
[03:36:58.250 --> 03:37:04.498]  It's still the current held belief that all cultures are valid and all cultures are equal, despite
[03:37:04.998 --> 03:37:09.740]  Observable differences in outcome, prosperity, and human dignity.
[03:37:09.740 --> 03:37:19.125]  All thought regarding cultures as being equal was elevated to a sacrosanct fact that only a perceived idiot could dispute.
[03:37:19.125 --> 03:37:25.348]  And again, another completely anti-ingroup preference that is uniquely Western.
[03:37:26.008 --> 03:37:40.596]  And as liberalism continued to evolve, the civil rights movement sought to convince all that there are absolutely no differences between the races, as the sexual revolution sought to convince men that there are no differences between the genders.
[03:37:40.956 --> 03:37:46.319]  That's not to say that races are not equal or that one is superior to the other.
[03:37:46.319 --> 03:37:54.382]  To the contrary, Inuit, Amazonian tribesmen, European, or Thai fishermen each have their strengths and weaknesses.
[03:37:54.382 --> 03:38:03.667]  But there are obvious differences in easily quantifiable things such as bone density, muscle mass, and for better or worse, cognitive abilities.
[03:38:04.187 --> 03:38:05.628]  The same for gender.
[03:38:05.628 --> 03:38:14.255]  Prior to the last few decades, men and women, instead of being at odds with each other as they are now, filled roles that complemented each other.
[03:38:14.255 --> 03:38:25.044]  And whether we like it or not, created and maintained families, which is the building block of societies and civilizations, much better than our post-modern sensibilities do.
[03:38:25.484 --> 03:38:39.295]  The suppression of in-group preference has led, logically, to mass, uncontrolled immigration of people from completely incompatible cultures, most of whom are not even able to take care of themselves once they arrive.
[03:38:39.295 --> 03:38:45.721]  And, as they pour into the West, social stability and community cohesion is destroyed.
[03:38:46.121 --> 03:39:09.640]  The suppression of observable differences between the genders has also given us the ridiculous Hollywood movies of superhuman women being able to beat down a dozen men twice their size, but also real problems of declining fertility and malignant family laws that discriminate toward men that are at the core of the grievance that many have in the MGTOW movement.
[03:39:10.140 --> 03:39:20.984]  As society has become more secular, enriched with vibrant diversity, and much less cohesive, standards of personal behavior and even personal appearance are ebbing lower daily.
[03:39:20.984 --> 03:39:28.707]  Search the term people of Walmart, which is a very good visual example of where society is at this point in time.
[03:39:29.227 --> 03:39:34.709]  This may seem like regression, but it's still in line with the same liberal ideal.
[03:39:34.709 --> 03:39:40.731]  Immigration was ramped up in the 1960s, while simultaneously the concept of assimilation was destroyed.
[03:39:40.731 --> 03:39:49.074]  After that came gay rights, which took less than a generation to go from the Defense of Marriage Act to full legalization in virtually all Western countries.
[03:39:49.734 --> 03:39:54.916]  Norms are all but gone now, and in most cases, norms are to be socially ridiculed.
[03:39:54.916 --> 03:39:56.717]  Kids don't need a mom or dad.
[03:39:56.717 --> 03:40:00.538]  Heterosexuality is just one option among many.
[03:40:00.538 --> 03:40:03.879]  Sexual relations with animals is a choice.
[03:40:03.879 --> 03:40:14.223]  The current normalization of the transgender is almost complete, and thus, there will need to be new frontiers in the long march of liberalism.
[03:40:14.223 --> 03:40:16.724]  And on and on it will proceed.
[03:40:17.464 --> 03:40:26.894]  At the moment, female genital mutilation, which has arrived, incidentally, with the flow of culturally incompatible immigration, is something that we're seeing in the news these days.
[03:40:26.894 --> 03:40:39.166]  And we're told by the mindless CNN talking heads and their ilk that we, whatever that means, that we in the West universally revile it, as it is fundamentally against our values.
[03:40:40.217 --> 03:40:47.022]  Wait a decade, and the demographic changes that that decade will bring, and see where that argument is.
[03:40:47.022 --> 03:40:55.807]  The same talking heads will be calling anyone who disagrees with it in several years as a bigot, or a female genital mutilation phobe.
[03:40:55.807 --> 03:40:58.870]  Think pedophilia normalization is unthinkable?
[03:40:58.870 --> 03:41:00.411]  Two words.
[03:41:00.411 --> 03:41:02.552]  Ayesha and Islamophobia.
[03:41:02.552 --> 03:41:05.114]  Normalizing anything... Back it up three seconds.
[03:41:05.114 --> 03:41:07.655]  This was made two years ago.
[03:41:07.655 --> 03:41:09.777]  I have stacks of news I don't even want to cover.
[03:41:10.758 --> 03:41:22.227]  Where the Democratic Party, the Labour Party in England, with parents taking their kids out naked and letting men hump them with erections, and they're saying, oh, it's kink, kids like sex.
[03:41:22.227 --> 03:41:23.208]  That's in the news today.
[03:41:23.208 --> 03:41:26.691]  But if you oppose it, they say you're into child porn with no proof.
[03:41:28.356 --> 03:41:29.917]  These people are sick.
[03:41:29.917 --> 03:41:39.880]  And so what it is, is the West's openness is being used against it to bring it down and conquer it by a broken coalition strategy of groups of piratical criminals.
[03:41:39.880 --> 03:41:41.201]  Continue.
[03:41:41.201 --> 03:41:48.203]  Anyone who disagrees with it in several years as a bigot or a female genital mutilation phobe.
[03:41:48.203 --> 03:41:51.265]  Think pedophilia normalization is unthinkable?
[03:41:51.265 --> 03:41:52.825]  Two words.
[03:41:52.825 --> 03:41:54.946]  Aisha and Islamophobia.
[03:41:54.946 --> 03:41:57.647]  Normalizing anything at this point is a possibility.
[03:41:58.277 --> 03:42:02.258]  None of this presentation is to say that people don't deserve to have their rights.
[03:42:02.258 --> 03:42:08.540]  But some rights have, in part, always been surrendered for the good of the community and to keep it cohesive.
[03:42:08.540 --> 03:42:11.721]  The problem is, there is no collective community anymore.
[03:42:11.721 --> 03:42:12.802]  Only atomized groups.
[03:42:14.690 --> 03:42:16.851]  I'm going to post the full video to InfoWars.com.
[03:42:16.851 --> 03:42:20.632]  When we upload this later to our own servers, I'll add the rest of it.
[03:42:20.632 --> 03:42:23.894]  There's three minutes left where it really comes down to the crescendo.
[03:42:23.894 --> 03:42:29.276]  It's a very important video that again we'll post to InfoWars.com.
[03:42:29.276 --> 03:42:31.017]  Very important information.
[03:42:31.017 --> 03:42:34.478]  Again, remember, we won't be here if it isn't for you.
[03:42:36.368 --> 03:42:43.078]  So don't forget, we have the Save Info Wars Mega Special, free shipping, double Patriot points, 50% off, InfoWarsHore.com.
[03:42:43.078 --> 03:42:45.782]  You can tell they're launching their biggest attacks ever.

[03:42:48.045 --> 03:42:50.008]  Please take action today.

[03:42:58.334 --> 03:43:06.897]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:43:06.897 --> 03:43:09.878]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:43:09.878 --> 03:43:11.618]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:43:11.618 --> 03:43:17.880]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[03:43:19.981 --> 03:43:25.303]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[03:43:25.303 --> 03:43:28.264]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:43:28.264 --> 03:43:31.885]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:43:31.885 --> 03:43:36.166]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:43:36.166 --> 03:43:37.987]  I've got two in my home.
[03:43:37.987 --> 03:43:44.089]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:43:44.089 --> 03:43:44.929]  Don't live
[03:43:45.749 --> 03:43:49.830]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[03:43:49.830 --> 03:43:51.671]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:51.671 --> 03:43:55.972]  I want to be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[03:43:55.972 --> 03:44:03.854]  We're going into the season of war, and they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[03:44:03.854 --> 03:44:07.515]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[03:44:07.515 --> 03:44:08.435]  We need to end here.
[03:44:08.435 --> 03:44:09.756]  We need to be provisioned.
[03:44:09.756 --> 03:44:13.757]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fairly
[03:44:14.357 --> 03:44:18.220]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[03:44:18.220 --> 03:44:20.141]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[03:44:20.141 --> 03:44:25.124]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[03:44:25.124 --> 03:44:28.425]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[03:44:28.425 --> 03:44:29.266]  I need gas.
[03:44:29.266 --> 03:44:30.807]  I need ammo politically now.
[03:44:31.187 --> 03:44:37.494]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[03:44:37.494 --> 03:44:38.615]  We're unstoppable together.
[03:44:38.615 --> 03:44:40.016]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[03:44:40.016 --> 03:44:47.064]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[03:44:47.064 --> 03:44:48.045]  You have my commitment.
[03:44:48.045 --> 03:44:52.390]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[03:44:55.480 --> 03:45:01.587]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[03:45:01.587 --> 03:45:09.076]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[03:45:09.076 --> 03:45:10.397]  Are you coming back?
[03:45:10.397 --> 03:45:11.498]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[03:45:12.159 --> 03:45:13.519]  We're at Newshorse.com.
[03:45:13.519 --> 03:45:15.760]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[03:45:15.760 --> 03:45:16.681]  We have our own videos.
[03:45:16.681 --> 03:45:17.761]  We have our own articles.
[03:45:17.761 --> 03:45:22.522]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[03:45:22.522 --> 03:45:24.783]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[03:45:24.783 --> 03:45:26.484]  InfoWars!
[03:45:26.484 --> 03:45:29.665]  Until next time!
[03:45:29.665 --> 03:45:29.745]  Woo!
[03:45:31.124 --> 03:45:33.905]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[03:45:33.905 --> 03:45:35.706]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[03:45:35.706 --> 03:45:38.767]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:45:38.767 --> 03:45:40.688]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[03:45:40.688 --> 03:45:44.169]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[03:45:44.169 --> 03:45:46.950]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[03:45:46.950 --> 03:45:49.331]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:45:49.331 --> 03:45:50.271]  That's where they find it.
[03:45:50.271 --> 03:45:52.152]  You know, there's things called websites.
[03:45:52.152 --> 03:45:52.572]  Just go there.
[03:45:55.182 --> 03:45:59.609]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[03:45:59.609 --> 03:46:07.260]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[03:46:07.260 --> 03:46:09.464]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price.
[03:46:09.464 --> 03:46:10.125]  And we're moving at
[03:46:10.485 --> 03:46:11.205]  I think?
[03:46:29.915 --> 03:46:30.896]  I like to be expanding.
[03:46:30.896 --> 03:46:31.657]  I like to be winning.
[03:46:31.657 --> 03:46:32.377]  I like to be fighting.
[03:46:32.377 --> 03:46:33.559]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[03:46:33.559 --> 03:46:34.439]  That's why we're so hated.
[03:46:34.439 --> 03:46:36.061]  But we need to be retreaded.
[03:46:36.061 --> 03:46:37.262]  We need to be tuned up.
[03:46:37.262 --> 03:46:38.323]  We need to be fixed up.
[03:46:38.323 --> 03:46:39.664]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[03:46:39.664 --> 03:46:41.206]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[03:46:41.206 --> 03:46:46.030]  And if the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[03:46:46.030 --> 03:46:48.032]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[03:46:48.032 --> 03:46:50.895]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor.
[03:46:50.895 --> 03:46:52.336]  Funded by foreign banks and the TICOM.
[03:46:52.336 --> 03:46:53.978]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[03:46:57.631 --> 03:47:09.913]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:09.913 --> 03:47:26.176]  My heart burns with desire each time I burn with desire each time my heart
[03:47:26.960 --> 03:47:35.809]  She cried when I left her Now I cry to forget her Oh how foolish I was
[03:47:53.041 --> 03:47:56.862]  NXIVM is how you're supposed to pronounce it, but it's N-X-I-V-M.
[03:47:56.862 --> 03:48:00.024]  You gotta love how we were the first to expose it, like, three years ago.
[03:48:00.024 --> 03:48:06.446]  I said, there's a cult in Hollywood, New York, where they brand women and they starve them to death, and Harvey Weinstein has sex with them.
[03:48:06.446 --> 03:48:09.967]  And the Huffington Post came out and said I had defamed him.
[03:48:09.967 --> 03:48:18.190]  No, I was told by people in Hollywood that Harvey Weinstein was part of a cult where they chain women up and branded them and brainwashed them, and the Clintons were involved.
[03:48:19.011 --> 03:48:24.835]  And that movies like Fifty Shades of Grey, based on the book, were priming on women to be part of it.
[03:48:24.835 --> 03:48:27.557]  So I can tell you about it first, but I can't pronounce it right.
[03:48:27.557 --> 03:48:31.479]  And I wasn't told it was even NXIVM when I was told about it by multiple sources.
[03:48:31.479 --> 03:48:39.985]  And then Roger Stone confirmed it, and it turned out in court documents, the head guy just got convicted today, that Roger was recruited by a subgroup.
[03:48:39.985 --> 03:48:43.528]  They didn't tell him it was even this group, and he got out of it in like, you know, a week.
[03:48:43.528 --> 03:48:46.950]  He was there as a consultant, there as a speaker, and it turned out he was a target of them.
[03:48:48.444 --> 03:48:50.527]  Because he was close to Trump.
[03:48:50.527 --> 03:48:53.411]  They wanted to break into his phone and be able to get him.
[03:48:53.411 --> 03:48:54.292]  Get Roger Stone on.
[03:48:54.292 --> 03:48:58.478]  I know we can't come on about the gag order with the whole Russia fake thing, but he can come on about this.
[03:48:58.478 --> 03:48:59.940]  We should get Roger on tomorrow.
[03:48:59.940 --> 03:49:01.342]  Because he told me all this on air.
[03:49:01.342 --> 03:49:02.183]  He said it all.
[03:49:02.183 --> 03:49:02.784]  He is vindicated.
[03:49:04.039 --> 03:49:09.806]  Well, Millie Weaver is awesome, and she recruited Kaitlin Bennett, who's not going out of the park as well.
[03:49:09.806 --> 03:49:11.809]  She went to the big Trump rally yesterday.
[03:49:11.809 --> 03:49:17.716]  I'm told, coming up in about 20 minutes, she's going to do her own livestream with some special guests today.
[03:49:17.716 --> 03:49:19.278]  And so Millie Weaver was there last night.
[03:49:19.278 --> 03:49:20.219]  How many were inside?
[03:49:20.219 --> 03:49:21.881]  How many were outside?
[03:49:21.881 --> 03:49:22.562]  Hillary sat her...
[03:49:23.697 --> 03:49:24.197]  Thank you.
[03:49:44.534 --> 03:49:45.635]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:49:45.635 --> 03:49:48.697]  You know, the Trump rally was massive.
[03:49:48.697 --> 03:49:58.625]  I tried to follow the Trump line to get into the event because I thought, oh, we can, you know, do a time lapse and speed it up and show people how long the line was.
[03:49:58.625 --> 03:50:02.528]  But after walking, I think at least a mile and a half, we got tired.
[03:50:02.528 --> 03:50:05.271]  We're like, all right, the line is never ending.
[03:50:05.271 --> 03:50:07.272]  We're not going to find an end to this line.
[03:50:07.272 --> 03:50:10.935]  I mean, the line was so long, Alex.
[03:50:10.935 --> 03:50:11.936]  It was insane.
[03:50:13.657 --> 03:50:17.040]  I almost think they're underestimating 130,000 people.
[03:50:17.040 --> 03:50:18.261]  There were so many people there.
[03:50:18.261 --> 03:50:20.963]  The whole city was full of Trump supporters.
[03:50:20.963 --> 03:50:28.569]  Now, they also had a permitted area where these anti-Trump protests could go on, and the police were surrounding that area.
[03:50:28.569 --> 03:50:36.275]  It was like a whole city, like a whole city street that they blockaded, and they literally had a, you know,
[03:50:36.995 --> 03:50:49.779]  Leftist, Democrat, transgender person that was part of the event organization, standing there with the police, like a bridge troll, telling people who could and could not pass.
[03:50:49.779 --> 03:50:56.560]  So, I tried to go up and talk to some of the protesters, but the police advised me, they said, you're not allowed in here.
[03:50:56.560 --> 03:50:58.881]  I'm like, what do you mean I'm not allowed in here?
[03:50:58.881 --> 03:51:02.442]  Yeah, the event organizer said that they don't want you here.
[03:51:02.442 --> 03:51:05.223]  They don't want you or they don't want InfoWars here at all.
[03:51:05.703 --> 03:51:17.328]  Caitlin Bennett, like, somehow got past their radar and was in there for about 10 minutes and she got spit on and assaulted and then, you know, at that point the police then had her leave the area.
[03:51:17.328 --> 03:51:18.268]  By the way, what's that story?
[03:51:18.268 --> 03:51:20.029]  I love that when I was a little kid.
[03:51:20.029 --> 03:51:22.150]  Three Billy Goats Gruff.
[03:51:22.150 --> 03:51:23.131]  Yeah.
[03:51:23.131 --> 03:51:24.071]  The Bridge Trolls.
[03:51:24.071 --> 03:51:25.592]  You will not pass.
[03:51:25.592 --> 03:51:26.432]  I mean, it was crazy.
[03:51:26.432 --> 03:51:30.414]  You notice the first little one comes across and says, a much fatter and juicier one's coming.
[03:51:30.414 --> 03:51:33.275]  The second one goes, oh, a really big juicy one's coming.
[03:51:35.762 --> 03:51:37.143]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:51:37.143 --> 03:51:39.586]  Yeah, so it was just wild.
[03:51:39.586 --> 03:51:46.492]  But the real action, the real great story that's out there is that all these people came out to support the president.
[03:51:46.492 --> 03:51:51.637]  And you would not believe, I mean, Florida has a lot of people who have Cuban descent.
[03:51:52.097 --> 03:51:56.719]  You would not believe how many Cuban Americans are out there and they love President Trump.
[03:51:56.719 --> 03:51:57.459]  They really do.
[03:51:57.459 --> 03:52:13.125]  And the other thing, I kid you not, I was asking Michael, our camera guy after this, I'm like, how many people do you think out of everyone we talked to or just came into contact with, all the Trump supporters out there, out of all the Trump supporters out there, how many do you think were InfoWars fans?
[03:52:13.545 --> 03:52:16.147]  He's like, at least 70%.
[03:52:16.147 --> 03:52:19.829]  I mean, that is how much love we got out there, Alex.
[03:52:19.829 --> 03:52:21.830]  People love InfoWars.
[03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:26.793]  The scary thing is, is that many of these people are like, where do we find InfoWars?
[03:52:26.793 --> 03:52:28.014]  Alex is gone now.
[03:52:28.014 --> 03:52:30.156]  They don't know to go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:52:30.156 --> 03:52:32.217]  That's why those of you guys who are listening,
[03:52:32.577 --> 03:52:32.817]  No, no, no.
[03:52:32.817 --> 03:52:34.480]  Millie, Millie, that's what's so critical.
[03:52:34.480 --> 03:52:38.064]  They always, because we were number one on iTunes, number one news tab everywhere.
[03:52:38.064 --> 03:52:40.247]  I mean, I didn't want to, because they were banning us everywhere.
[03:52:40.247 --> 03:52:42.831]  I was sitting there going, I hope they don't figure out iTunes.
[03:52:42.831 --> 03:52:45.194]  Like 39 million subscribers to all our shows.
[03:52:45.194 --> 03:52:48.558]  David Knight had like 9 million just to his show.
[03:52:48.558 --> 03:52:49.659]  He'd only been on like a year.
[03:52:50.140 --> 03:52:52.942]  That being the show, it was huge.
[03:52:52.942 --> 03:52:56.205]  And when they hit that, it was like, whoa, being punched in the stomach.
[03:52:56.205 --> 03:52:57.066]  But exactly.
[03:52:57.066 --> 03:52:59.628]  And then all these people are like, we wish Alex was on air.
[03:52:59.628 --> 03:53:01.690]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[03:53:01.690 --> 03:53:03.771]  And I know this audience gets it.
[03:53:03.771 --> 03:53:04.932]  That's why it's critical.
[03:53:04.932 --> 03:53:06.494]  We should go to these rallies, actually.
[03:53:06.494 --> 03:53:07.795]  I know you want to do that.
[03:53:07.795 --> 03:53:08.275]  You're going to do it.
[03:53:08.275 --> 03:53:10.357]  We're going to print you 100,000 bumper stickers and say,
[03:53:10.797 --> 03:53:14.259]  Alex Jones is still on air, InfoWars.com.
[03:53:14.259 --> 03:53:18.181]  Or find Alex Jones at InfoWars.com because they get habituated.
[03:53:18.181 --> 03:53:24.424]  I get it to YouTube or Facebook or Twitter and we're off there, but they can find us at InfoWars.com.
[03:53:25.419 --> 03:53:27.880]  Oh, we were being mobbed for stickers, Alex.
[03:53:27.880 --> 03:53:28.740]  It was insane.
[03:53:28.740 --> 03:53:32.102]  Everyone's all, we want stickers, we want, like, people were mobbing us.
[03:53:32.102 --> 03:53:33.262]  InfoWars, we love you!
[03:53:33.262 --> 03:53:35.483]  Well, that's why you're going to be at all the events now.
[03:53:35.483 --> 03:53:37.404]  You're going to be at all the events.
[03:53:37.404 --> 03:53:40.806]  We're trying to get financing to get the gas for the RV, but we salute you.
[03:53:40.806 --> 03:53:42.486]  You're so hardworking, Millie, with your crew.
[03:53:42.486 --> 03:53:48.449]  And we're going to try to hire a couple more reporters to get another RV so we can be at all these events the next year and a half and be in the game.
[03:53:49.429 --> 03:53:52.191]  Exactly, and we are going to keep fighting the fight.
[03:53:52.191 --> 03:53:54.033]  That's why we need your guys' support.
[03:53:54.033 --> 03:53:56.815]  We need you guys to support us at InfoWars.com.
[03:53:56.815 --> 03:54:02.180]  Not only that, we need you guys to share with your friends on your social media accounts.
[03:54:02.180 --> 03:54:04.201]  I want you all to do this right now.
[03:54:04.201 --> 03:54:15.570]  If you care about InfoWars, if you care about truth, about real news, about our country, share on your social media pages where people can find Alex Jones' radio show.
[03:54:15.570 --> 03:54:17.312]  Let them have a direct link
[03:54:17.652 --> 03:54:23.057]  To our website, InfoWars.com, go to the section that says Radio Show.
[03:54:23.057 --> 03:54:27.840]  Share that with everyone, your family, your friends, because there are so many people who don't know.
[03:54:27.840 --> 03:54:36.868]  We know you, the listener, you know where to find it, but there's many listeners for InfoWars and Alex Jones that don't know that we still are out here and where to find us.
[03:54:37.388 --> 03:54:43.693]  So I just ask you, the listeners, please share the link to InfoWarsShow.com.
[03:54:43.693 --> 03:54:46.154]  Absolutely, because you're getting what I'm getting now.
[03:54:46.154 --> 03:54:49.056]  You go to a Trump rally, and I would always say half the people are listeners.
[03:54:49.056 --> 03:54:50.297]  You're saying even more.
[03:54:50.297 --> 03:54:53.759]  And you see all the old InfoWars t-shirts and very few of the new ones.
[03:54:53.759 --> 03:54:56.822]  And it's because they just were used to seeing us in their feeds and everywhere.
[03:54:56.822 --> 03:55:00.564]  We've got to say, hey, the system thinks you're dumb and won't come find the source.
[03:55:00.564 --> 03:55:01.885]  That's why Drudge came here three years ago.
[03:55:01.885 --> 03:55:04.167]  He said, Alex, at dinner and on air, he said, listen.
[03:55:04.787 --> 03:55:06.650]  They're going to kick everybody off the big platforms.
[03:55:06.650 --> 03:55:08.913]  You've got to like DrudgeReport.com.
[03:55:08.913 --> 03:55:11.137]  You've got to tell everybody, get to InfoWars now.
[03:55:11.137 --> 03:55:12.459]  Get to NewsWars now.
[03:55:12.459 --> 03:55:13.961]  And I said, but we are doing our own thing.
[03:55:13.961 --> 03:55:17.206]  He goes, listen, at dinner, he even kind of pointed a fork at me.
[03:55:17.206 --> 03:55:19.309]  He said, I'm not trying to lecture you, man.
[03:55:19.810 --> 03:55:26.813]  But I'm telling you, you've got to start telling people now and only having content on your own thing you point them at, because they're not going to remember when it happens.
[03:55:26.813 --> 03:55:30.835]  Drudge is so damn smart, and I wish I would have listened.
[03:55:30.835 --> 03:55:34.177]  Other people, because he made public statements too, did not listen to him.
[03:55:34.177 --> 03:55:35.678]  They're totally wiped out.
[03:55:35.678 --> 03:55:37.438]  They're not even having a fighting chance.
[03:55:37.438 --> 03:55:42.681]  We halfway listened to him, and we'd already instinctively built our own thing because of censorship.
[03:55:42.681 --> 03:55:45.642]  But absolutely, listeners, you're the people that are smart enough.
[03:55:45.642 --> 03:55:46.723]  And I don't mean that meanly.
[03:55:46.723 --> 03:55:47.843]  We're all habituated.
[03:55:47.843 --> 03:55:48.484]  I get lazy.
[03:55:49.673 --> 03:55:56.876]  Hawaii Five-O used to be on some local TV station I have rabbit ears for, and I'd watch that with my kids, because it's a pretty wholesome show.
[03:55:56.876 --> 03:55:59.858]  Well, now that TV station changed and it's like Spanish TV.
[03:55:59.858 --> 03:56:02.219]  I don't even know how to find Hawaii Five-O, so I stopped watching.
[03:56:02.219 --> 03:56:04.220]  I'm talking about the old show and the new show.
[03:56:04.220 --> 03:56:05.200]  So, it's the same thing.
[03:56:05.200 --> 03:56:06.381]  People got to be reminded.
[03:56:06.381 --> 03:56:07.801]  Hey!
[03:56:07.801 --> 03:56:08.962]  They don't want you to get it.
[03:56:08.962 --> 03:56:10.242]  They're trying to stop you.
[03:56:10.242 --> 03:56:12.303]  It's at InfoWars.com.
[03:56:12.303 --> 03:56:13.624]  Tell everybody.
[03:56:13.624 --> 03:56:14.664]  Pass it on.
[03:56:14.664 --> 03:56:16.125]  It's at InfoWars.com.
[03:56:16.125 --> 03:56:17.006]  Pass it on.
[03:56:17.006 --> 03:56:17.806]  But let me tell you, Millie.
[03:56:19.417 --> 03:56:20.699]  What do you make?
[03:56:20.699 --> 03:56:22.261]  I'm not going to get back into this, but it's too crazy.
[03:56:22.261 --> 03:56:30.453]  The AP said that I lost a lawsuit over a book I was not even in or wrote or ever read, and that I'm going to be arrested and all this stuff.
[03:56:30.453 --> 03:56:33.718]  And it's been the top story everywhere, and the whole fake child porn thing.
[03:56:33.718 --> 03:56:34.379]  What do you make of that?
[03:56:35.535 --> 03:56:37.156]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[03:56:37.156 --> 03:56:44.658]  It's an outright hit piece against you, Alex, by the liberal Democrat-controlled mainstream media outlets.
[03:56:44.658 --> 03:56:53.701]  They are trying to tear InfoWars down and destroy you because they think that InfoWars, they know that InfoWars played a massive role in the election outcome.
[03:56:53.701 --> 03:56:55.341]  They know it.
[03:56:55.341 --> 03:56:59.882]  Every other person out there at the Trump rally has InfoWars shirts on.
[03:56:59.882 --> 03:57:04.644]  It's like people can't get enough of it and we are trying to do everything we can to expose
[03:57:05.084 --> 03:57:05.925]  We're out of time.
[03:57:05.925 --> 03:57:06.866]  We're out of time, Millie.
[03:57:06.866 --> 03:57:09.188]  The war room has come up with Owen Schroyer.
[03:57:26.483 --> 03:57:28.244]  And you've got your own YouTube channel.
[03:57:28.244 --> 03:57:30.506]  I'm told you're going to go live in about 30 minutes or so.
[03:57:30.506 --> 03:57:32.328]  That's Millennium Millie on YouTube.
[03:57:32.328 --> 03:57:33.348]  Everybody go to her channel.
[03:57:33.348 --> 03:57:34.769]  She's got a special guest, I'm told.
[03:57:34.769 --> 03:57:35.330]  Thank you, Millie.
[03:57:35.330 --> 03:57:36.230]  Great job with the crew.
[03:57:36.230 --> 03:57:38.512]  War Room is one minute away.
[03:57:38.512 --> 03:57:39.693]  Spread the word, please.
[03:57:39.693 --> 03:57:44.036]  Hillary absolutely hates it.
[03:57:44.036 --> 03:57:46.518]  InfoWars.
[03:57:46.518 --> 03:57:48.700]  The most banned network in the world.
[03:57:49.059 --> 03:57:53.503]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border, talks about MS-13 and more.
[03:57:53.503 --> 03:57:54.443]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[03:57:54.443 --> 03:57:54.884]  Yes, sir.
[03:57:54.884 --> 03:57:56.185]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:57:56.185 --> 03:57:58.287]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[03:57:58.287 --> 03:58:02.030]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case.
[03:58:02.030 --> 03:58:04.211]  My truck, sports shirts, all the equipment.
[03:58:04.211 --> 03:58:06.173]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[03:58:06.173 --> 03:58:07.154]  God bless you, brother.
[03:58:07.154 --> 03:58:13.439]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody, just to help spread the word.
[03:58:14.120 --> 03:58:15.240]  You're our only hope, brother.
[03:58:15.240 --> 03:58:17.542]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[03:58:17.542 --> 03:58:20.304]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
