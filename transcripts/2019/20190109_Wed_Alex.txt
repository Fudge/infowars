[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.083]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:11.764 --> 00:00:14.026]  My fellow Americans.
[00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:22.111]  Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.
[00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:30.153]  Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country.
[00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:37.475]  We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.
[00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:44.577]  America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation.
[00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:51.099]  But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration.
[00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.100]  It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.281]  Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.
[00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:10.204]  Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.
[00:01:11.164 --> 00:01:20.494]  Every week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90% of which floods across from our southern border.
[00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:27.461]  More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.
[00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:41.693]  In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:02:01.673]  Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now.
[00:02:02.694 --> 00:02:09.421]  This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul.
[00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:17.996]  Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase.
[00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:24.540]  These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.
[00:02:25.421 --> 00:02:30.824]  One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico.
[00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:37.128]  Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.
[00:02:37.768 --> 00:02:43.036]  This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.
[00:02:43.657 --> 00:02:49.204]  This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:03:01.546]  My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers.
[00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:03.827]  It's a tremendous problem.
[00:03:04.507 --> 00:03:11.731]  Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:19.268]  These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe.
[00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:22.871]  In fact, safer than ever before.
[00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:34.258]  The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband, and many other things.
[00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:46.549]  We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy.
[00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.635]  Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.
[00:03:55.375 --> 00:04:07.222]  Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.
[00:04:08.203 --> 00:04:18.370]  Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier.
[00:04:18.711 --> 00:04:35.303]  Alright folks, that is the first few minutes of the President's nine and a half minute address last night, where he reversed course from what he had been saying, what the Vice President had been saying, what we've been lobbying for, and what has been the big buzz the last few weeks.
[00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.890]  And that is declaring a national emergency.
[00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.971]  This country is in an emergency, and he has to do it to counterman the previous executive orders in place.
[00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:50.332]  That's where presidents normally sign a bunch of executive orders right when they come in to override the past ones.
[00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:56.554]  And Trump did that to a certain extent, but not the ones repealing basically the martial law Obama put us under.
[00:04:56.834 --> 00:05:00.135]  We'll break it all down straight ahead, but this is some dire, dire straits.
[00:05:03.824 --> 00:05:04.985]  Defeat the globalists.
[00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:06.646]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:08.287]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[00:05:08.727 --> 00:05:09.827]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:15.030]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.892]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:27.537]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:28.457 --> 00:05:37.840]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.422]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[00:05:42.482 --> 00:05:48.383]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[00:05:48.444 --> 00:05:51.264]  Call to talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[00:05:51.464 --> 00:05:52.705]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:52.965 --> 00:05:56.006]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[00:05:58.422 --> 00:05:59.587]  We're good to go.
[00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:25.120]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.021]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:30.481 --> 00:06:34.283]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:06:34.663 --> 00:06:36.343]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:37.224 --> 00:06:46.907]  You know, if you watch what's happening, not just here, but in South America, in Eastern Europe, in Western Europe, in areas of Asia, in the UK, all over the place,
[00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:49.763]  Populist movements are exploding.
[00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:54.305]  Nations from Brazil to Australia are pulling out of the fake carbon taxes.
[00:06:54.825 --> 00:07:01.629]  It was Paris where they got the world government law in place and now Macron's had to back out of that.
[00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:11.814]  So there are very positive good things happening against the UN globalist led attempt to collapse nation states and bring in a one world government.
[00:07:12.594 --> 00:07:13.415]  There's a big awakening.
[00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:22.963]  But it's like a football game that's gone into overtime, and one minute we're about to win, the next minute they're winning.
[00:07:24.223 --> 00:07:24.984]  It's that close.
[00:07:25.004 --> 00:07:38.271]  So I've been very exuberant the last few days that Trump's fired a bunch of globalists and a bunch of chi-com operatives, and he has been signaling that he's going to get very aggressive with the deep state.
[00:07:39.331 --> 00:07:43.934]  But he announced six months ago he was going to declassify all the illegal spying on him.
[00:07:44.795 --> 00:07:49.798]  And then he ordered it and suddenly, well, intelligence agencies are refusing to do it.
[00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:55.140]  And then you say, well, it's like telling your kids to clean their room and they won't do it.
[00:07:55.821 --> 00:08:05.846]  He's got 16, 17 agencies, 800,000 contractors, over a million intelligence operatives, and they're just doing whatever they want.
[00:08:08.467 --> 00:08:11.549]  And so you saw them reverse and not follow his order there.
[00:08:12.996 --> 00:08:17.398]  You saw Trump say, pull our 2,000 troops out that are giving weapons to the Kurds.
[00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:19.779]  Stop destabilizing the area.
[00:08:19.819 --> 00:08:21.340]  We still have troops right there in Iraq.
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.741]  We have missile cruisers in the Mediterranean.
[00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:27.863]  We're still there, but not with our troops on the ground in sand and blood.
[00:08:29.323 --> 00:08:34.325]  And within days, the bureaucracy says, we're not going to do it.
[00:08:35.906 --> 00:08:38.887]  We're going to do whatever we want, whenever we want.
[00:08:44.113 --> 00:08:45.494]  That's how these people operate.
[00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.837]  And so, I'm not just talking up here.
[00:08:50.998 --> 00:09:00.105]  Trump signals through Pence and himself that we're in an emergency, the country is in an emergency already, and I may declare one if they don't take action.
[00:09:00.225 --> 00:09:05.910]  Then they start threatening to plunge the stock market if he does that, and oh, it's going to make it worse.
[00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.371]  And he knows full well they're trying that.
[00:09:09.724 --> 00:09:11.925]  And then they start saying they're going to refuse to follow the order.
[00:09:12.606 --> 00:09:13.526]  So he blinked.
[00:09:14.146 --> 00:09:15.007]  He backed down from it.
[00:09:16.508 --> 00:09:19.049]  And that is not a good sign.
[00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:25.494]  And there's a lot of other examples of this as well, where the President gives an order and it's not followed.
[00:09:26.134 --> 00:09:34.876]  We've seen Mattis and Kelly brag about how, oh, we never both leave the city at the same time or leave the President's side because, you know, he might order a nuclear war or something.
[00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:40.138]  When he's trying to have peace with North Korea and peace with Russia and all the rest of it, and they're the ones pushing for war.
[00:09:41.078 --> 00:09:46.260]  And how routinely he signs an executive order and they just don't execute it and put it in the Federal Register.
[00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.692]  And hope he forgets about it because he's just trying to move through and make decisions.
[00:09:53.494 --> 00:09:55.036]  He called Trump an idiot and retarded.
[00:09:57.477 --> 00:10:10.266]  See, these guys all come from a system where they kiss each other's butts, where they act powerful, and where they act like they're in charge, you know what they're doing, but really they're all the bureaucracy and we're put there because they're yes-men.
[00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:13.729]  Trump is a entrepreneur
[00:10:15.498 --> 00:10:19.580]  And an individual who does care about the country and doesn't want to see it screwed over.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.701]  And thinks the president should be the president.
[00:10:22.761 --> 00:10:24.541]  And the swamp disdains that.
[00:10:24.822 --> 00:10:26.142]  They believe they've captured America.
[00:10:26.162 --> 00:10:27.102]  They believe they run America.
[00:10:27.302 --> 00:10:29.563]  But I'm going to make the announcement right here, right now.
[00:10:33.605 --> 00:10:41.728]  President Trump was on the knife's edge of truly becoming the president and being on the George Washington cut.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.542]  The George Washington mold of a true, absolute maverick trailblazer.
[00:10:48.302 --> 00:11:07.134]  He's been on the knife edge of being that or being a captured, gelded stallion, neutered, who is contained by a bunch of Washington manipulators that tell him whatever he wants to hear to his face and then talk absolute trash about him behind his back.
[00:11:07.174 --> 00:11:12.498]  So, he's been on the knife's edge of becoming the president and the real maverick they fear he could become.
[00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:15.269]  He's already a maverick.
[00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:27.234]  Or he could fall off the knife's edge and become a puppet president, completely cut off, like a Chinese emperor, where they think they're making decisions and giving orders, but they're not.
[00:11:29.054 --> 00:11:36.257]  And with what he did last night, it turns the ship towards the course more of the president not being the president.
[00:11:36.297 --> 00:11:42.019]  That's the headline for the live feed on Infowars.com today, is President Trump
[00:11:44.733 --> 00:11:46.594]  is becoming the president in name only.
[00:11:51.996 --> 00:11:56.277]  And he's being maneuvered towards impeachment and removal from office.
[00:11:56.337 --> 00:12:03.360]  And the deep state isn't going to allow the populism and the freedom that put him in office, that's the real message, is globally liberty is rising.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.041]  They're going to come after everyone
[00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:09.875]  The Christian Coalition.
[00:12:10.295 --> 00:12:11.276]  Franklin Graham.
[00:12:11.656 --> 00:12:12.916]  Mainline NRA.
[00:12:13.636 --> 00:12:14.617]  Understand that, folks.
[00:12:14.657 --> 00:12:15.937]  They set the precedent with me.
[00:12:16.597 --> 00:12:19.778]  They're coming for everyone.
[00:12:20.078 --> 00:12:22.079]  And they're coming for everyone now.
[00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:28.120]  In Europe, Germany has basically declared martial law over any nationalist.
[00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:35.562]  People are stopped at train stations and asked, if they're white, by the police, if they are racist right-wingers.
[00:12:36.123 --> 00:12:37.303]  They're just preparing people.
[00:12:39.208 --> 00:12:40.149]  If they have blonde hair.
[00:12:42.391 --> 00:12:44.112]  That's up on Infowars.com with the video.
[00:12:45.734 --> 00:12:46.815]  And then the police got asked about it.
[00:12:46.835 --> 00:12:48.456]  They said, oh, it's just a social experiment.
[00:12:48.616 --> 00:12:49.036]  Exactly.
[00:12:49.076 --> 00:12:54.161]  They're conditioning people to not say no to the invasion.
[00:12:54.621 --> 00:12:58.965]  Migrant boats have now showed up and landed in England, funded by Soros.
[00:13:01.387 --> 00:13:02.788]  So they're collapsing the third world.
[00:13:02.808 --> 00:13:06.151]  This is a global war against national sovereignty, a global war against humanity.
[00:13:08.456 --> 00:13:11.518]  And they're coming in with total internet censorship, total internet control.
[00:13:11.538 --> 00:13:14.580]  I'm going to break the architecture down of that today.
[00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:18.422]  And they're going to try to show the planet up.
[00:13:19.863 --> 00:13:23.025]  They're going to bring in the authoritarianism hardcore.
[00:13:24.105 --> 00:13:34.412]  If the nationalists in Brazil and the United States and the UK and France and everywhere else are unable to stop it.
[00:13:34.452 --> 00:13:35.993]  Now the globalists are very close to losing.
[00:13:36.863 --> 00:13:38.423]  That's why they're fighting so hard.
[00:13:39.544 --> 00:13:43.564]  But if we acquiesce to brazen authoritarianism, they could win.
[00:13:45.765 --> 00:13:47.505]  And see, they have nothing to lose.
[00:13:48.045 --> 00:13:49.126]  They know what they've done.
[00:13:49.206 --> 00:13:50.006]  They know their plan.
[00:13:50.126 --> 00:14:03.749]  It's official 2001 UN plan to flood the United States and Canada with 600 million migrants that they bring in who they brainwash and who they weaponize politically.
[00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:04.689]  That's official.
[00:14:05.589 --> 00:14:06.930]  That's from the official UN documents.
[00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:20.758]  They want 300 million in the UN plan by 2035, and of course you've heard Macron say by 2025, 200 million North Africans in Europe.
[00:14:20.778 --> 00:14:26.381]  15 million military-age men Muslims that just hit have turned Europe into a giant
[00:14:28.177 --> 00:14:30.598]  Outdoor sewer of rape, robbery, and death.
[00:14:31.298 --> 00:14:33.258]  So many articles and stories, I can't even keep track of it.
[00:14:33.638 --> 00:14:34.639]  You're like, this is insane!
[00:14:34.739 --> 00:14:35.799]  Why kill the tourism?
[00:14:36.099 --> 00:14:40.480]  Why have carjackings and highways blocked and thousands of cars burned tonight across Europe?
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.060]  Every night, thousands of cars.
[00:14:44.481 --> 00:14:47.542]  Because this is the left and the globalists breaking people!
[00:14:49.502 --> 00:14:50.462]  This is a siege!
[00:14:52.243 --> 00:14:56.424]  When the Vikings would invade your village, say in jolly old Cornwall, England,
[00:14:57.469 --> 00:15:05.775]  They'd rush in in the night, burning, screaming, killing, roaring, hoping you'd all just be naked, not be willing to pick up your sword and shield and run off into the woods.
[00:15:07.836 --> 00:15:09.558]  Then they could steal everything you had.
[00:15:10.679 --> 00:15:13.020]  And then go pick you off in the woods, take the women they wanted to.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.001]  It's the same thing.
[00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:26.390]  They're just turning giant migrant hordes, escorted by the police and the UN, in to rape and repine in a Attila the Hun or Viking-esque
[00:15:28.504 --> 00:15:30.085]  Scorched earth pillaging.
[00:15:30.245 --> 00:15:30.886]  It's the term.
[00:15:30.946 --> 00:15:32.427]  It's called pillaging.
[00:15:33.328 --> 00:15:34.428]  We're being pillaged.
[00:15:34.468 --> 00:15:36.330]  And now they're racking the U.S.
[00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:42.134]  up as if 35 million illegals isn't enough and MS-13 and all the mass crime waves out of Latin America.
[00:15:42.635 --> 00:15:45.036]  Trump says we have illegal aliens caught murdering people.
[00:15:45.417 --> 00:15:46.497]  They're criminals, some of them.
[00:15:46.537 --> 00:15:49.620]  And they go, oh, how dare you call convicted murderers criminals?
[00:15:50.595 --> 00:15:51.155]  So this is it.
[00:15:51.195 --> 00:15:58.459]  We're at war, and the guy we put in to try to stop it is being cut off from every angle of his rightful authority ahead of his removal.
[00:15:58.479 --> 00:16:00.200]  And then they're coming for everybody.
[00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:19.751]  The United States... Conservatively, there have been several thousand articles written in the last three years demonizing InfoWars, and yours truly, for selling high-quality supplements.
[00:16:20.922 --> 00:16:39.428]  In fact, even the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, that owns the biggest sellers of supplements in the world, even that organization has written hit pieces claiming I'm a fraud and selling snake oil when they're owned by a man who owns Amazon and Whole Foods.
[00:16:41.068 --> 00:16:43.109]  Amazon was the number one supplement seller in the world.
[00:16:43.489 --> 00:16:44.349]  Whole Foods was number two.
[00:16:45.209 --> 00:16:50.511]  He owns the number one and number two biggest supplement sellers on the planet.
[00:16:52.099 --> 00:16:58.380]  And then his publication, a weaponized disinformation op, says I'm bad and should be shut down.
[00:16:59.641 --> 00:17:13.323]  When more than 15 of the 70 products we have at Infowarslife.com are private labeled, highest quality, top of the line, that are sold at Whole Foods for higher prices.
[00:17:14.224 --> 00:17:16.264]  Think about the level of that fraud.
[00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.117]  And I've sent messages to these news organizations pointing that out.
[00:17:20.298 --> 00:17:20.899]  No response.
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.122]  They never want to get my comment.
[00:17:22.643 --> 00:17:23.566]  Now, why am I saying that?
[00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:25.210]  It's simple.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.804]  We have a lot of proprietary original products, but a lot of them are also private labeled.
[00:17:31.204 --> 00:17:36.489]  Whatever already has five stars, whatever people already love, whatever's been tested to be the best.
[00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.391]  So we have a great product.
[00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:38.911]  You love it.
[00:17:38.971 --> 00:17:39.592]  You reorder it.
[00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:42.234]  The Globals are going to test our products, trying to find something.
[00:17:42.715 --> 00:17:44.636]  So we're going to be able to, you know, defeat all that.
[00:17:44.776 --> 00:17:45.837]  It's a 360 win.
[00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:46.858]  We defeat them.
[00:17:46.938 --> 00:17:47.319]  You win.
[00:17:47.459 --> 00:17:47.779]  I win.
[00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:48.580]  It's amazing.
[00:17:50.433 --> 00:17:55.235]  And you've seen them come after our attempts to even process credit cards and shut down InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:17:55.275 --> 00:18:10.861]  I mean, it's incredible not just what frauds they are and how they're anti-free market and how they're racketeering against us, not just Jeff Bezos, but this entire system of mainstream media and mainstream corporations and banking are even worse than Bezos and Amazon.
[00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:13.299]  It's hard to believe.
[00:18:13.379 --> 00:18:16.120]  I'm just illustrating how crazy this all is.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:23.703]  Now, I'm going to be cutting some informational pieces in the next few weeks that go into great depth on each one of the products.
[00:18:24.524 --> 00:18:26.785]  I've done this for some of the products, but I haven't done it in a while.
[00:18:26.805 --> 00:18:36.309]  I haven't done it for the new products because, quite frankly, it's like going to school for a college exam to try to accurately talk about how great these products are.
[00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:37.129]  But just know this.
[00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:47.254]  Whatever the attributes that Jeff Bezos and Amazon and Whole Foods are allowed to tell you about their flagship products, these are as good or better.
[00:18:47.574 --> 00:18:49.795]  These are all the top of the line, very best.
[00:18:50.535 --> 00:19:00.860]  I can't even tell you what they do and the history of it and how amazing they are because they selectively enforce and will send the FDA after us.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.761]  You see, I'm a subhuman.
[00:19:02.881 --> 00:19:03.541]  I'm garbage.
[00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.182]  So Bezos can make all the claims.
[00:19:06.202 --> 00:19:07.703]  Whole Foods can make all the claims.
[00:19:08.877 --> 00:19:10.261]  Because this stuff is dynamite.
[00:19:10.862 --> 00:19:11.985]  Turmeric's dynamite.
[00:19:12.747 --> 00:19:14.391]  Iodine that's clean is dynamite.
[00:19:15.554 --> 00:19:17.238]  Super metal Vitality, they have similar products.
[00:19:17.298 --> 00:19:18.000]  It's all dynamite.
[00:19:19.571 --> 00:19:22.292]  They can tell you how great it is and show you all the facts and tell you.
[00:19:22.492 --> 00:19:23.433]  Because they're the elite.
[00:19:23.773 --> 00:19:24.473]  I'm just scum.
[00:19:25.113 --> 00:19:26.014]  Just like you, according to them.
[00:19:26.074 --> 00:19:28.495]  But the good news is, you've seen how great these products work.
[00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:33.016]  We do break down some of the basics on each page at m4slife.com to see how wonderful they are.
[00:19:33.517 --> 00:19:38.599]  But experience turmeric, experience X3, experience Supramel Vitality, Supramel Vitality.
[00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:42.800]  That, by the way, is the last run of our best-selling product, Supramel Vitality, Supramel.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:48.883]  Because we can't even get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, so we can't get the supply, and I'm sick of it, so I'm discontinuing it.
[00:19:49.423 --> 00:19:50.384]  Because it's so frustrating.
[00:19:50.404 --> 00:19:53.586]  This is the last run, and it's all 50% off.
[00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:58.610]  Bodies, X3, and Supermail at MFORWARESTORE.COM and MFORWARESLIFE.COM.
[00:19:58.790 --> 00:19:59.610]  Thanks for your support.
[00:20:06.015 --> 00:20:08.697]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:29.471 --> 00:20:29.931]  Welcome back.
[00:20:30.691 --> 00:20:40.593]  This is the Pro-America, Common Sense, Pro-Family, Pro-God, Pro-Prosperity Broadcast.
[00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:45.013]  And that's why we're absolutely hated by every scumbag organization on the planet.
[00:20:45.733 --> 00:20:48.434]  Because we've got the spirit to fight back and I'm never going to surrender.
[00:20:49.889 --> 00:20:59.937]  And we've made spectacular, light-year gains against the Globalists in the last five years that are hammer blow.
[00:21:00.718 --> 00:21:05.301]  In fact, they believe in their own white papers that they're losing and cannot win.
[00:21:06.302 --> 00:21:17.351]  And all this societal race war garbage they're putting out worldwide, playing different groups against each other, is just a desperate rearguard action while they secure their stolen wealth and hope they don't go to prison.
[00:21:19.844 --> 00:21:20.945]  And you have to understand something.
[00:21:24.627 --> 00:21:28.350]  When I've already read something four or five times and researched it, it's so painful.
[00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:34.313]  But I have to discipline myself and I need to come on air and do detailed reports and go over all the evidence.
[00:21:36.415 --> 00:21:45.721]  But you have to understand, they have the Tavistock Institute, DARPA, and their brain studies divisions and others working around the clock
[00:21:47.677 --> 00:22:00.264]  To demoralize not just this country but everyone else and to make people as unhealthy and as depressed as possible and to destroy society.
[00:22:01.005 --> 00:22:01.665]  That's the goal.
[00:22:02.746 --> 00:22:06.828]  The American Psychological Association came out today and they run the schools in this country.
[00:22:07.068 --> 00:22:13.912]  They follow UNESCO rules and they announced classic masculinity, that's a quote,
[00:22:15.259 --> 00:22:17.721]  Traits as a disorder.
[00:22:18.782 --> 00:22:20.303]  Now, you heard that right.
[00:22:20.403 --> 00:22:20.883]  Strong.
[00:22:21.364 --> 00:22:21.804]  Upright.
[00:22:22.705 --> 00:22:23.385]  Hardworking.
[00:22:23.906 --> 00:22:24.626]  Steadfast.
[00:22:25.006 --> 00:22:25.527]  Dauntless.
[00:22:26.187 --> 00:22:26.768]  Determined.
[00:22:27.648 --> 00:22:28.149]  Honorable.
[00:22:29.009 --> 00:22:29.770]  Stoicism.
[00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:30.991]  Competitiveness.
[00:22:32.772 --> 00:22:33.293]  Dominance.
[00:22:33.453 --> 00:22:33.913]  Aggression.
[00:22:35.314 --> 00:22:38.436]  All of this is toxic, and they're putting it on news like it's normal.
[00:22:38.697 --> 00:22:41.379]  Now, I told you, they're out to get the men, the boys.
[00:22:42.099 --> 00:22:42.940]  We'll talk about it more later.
[00:22:44.991 --> 00:22:46.412]  They're out to get anybody that will stand up.
[00:22:46.432 --> 00:22:47.673]  They're getting rid of the military.
[00:22:47.993 --> 00:22:49.655]  Everything's going to drones and robots.
[00:22:50.315 --> 00:22:55.359]  The old tradition of men is going, and it's going to be replaced by automated killer robots.
[00:22:57.681 --> 00:22:59.062]  So I'm going to cover this more coming up.
[00:23:00.703 --> 00:23:01.344]  But this is it!
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.181]  Now, of course, this isn't meant to empower women.
[00:23:06.001 --> 00:23:12.444]  They're just teaching women, you're going to, quote, take care of yourself, and the state's going to tell you what to do.
[00:23:12.904 --> 00:23:15.145]  It's going to be the dominant man now.
[00:23:18.047 --> 00:23:19.287]  And the technocracy is.
[00:23:20.588 --> 00:23:27.291]  And so this is a high-tech version of the slavery the Romans carried out, and others against captured populations.
[00:23:31.325 --> 00:23:34.007]  And that's why we read the history of slavery, different histories of it.
[00:23:34.287 --> 00:23:36.008]  And you look at this, it's very frightening.
[00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:38.750]  Very, very, very, very frightening.
[00:23:39.971 --> 00:23:46.495]  And while on the one hand they teach in all the universities, I remember 20 years ago, I was given a copy of a Calhoun reader.
[00:23:48.296 --> 00:23:54.080]  Because one of my friends, another talk show host here in Austin, his son was going to UT.
[00:23:55.561 --> 00:23:59.203]  And he was going to get a criminal justice degree, but he became a state trooper.
[00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:22.202]  And the official, just base-level social worker book, because you know they're segwaying into that in law enforcement, was that the family belongs to a prehistoric, primitive time and must be eradicated.
[00:24:23.383 --> 00:24:30.904]  And I remember when I got that and my heart was beating because I knew it was the plan and I'd seen it in UN documents, but to stare at it,
[00:24:33.536 --> 00:24:41.940]  And to see it, and now, 20 years later, the American Psychological Association says, men are bad, period.
[00:24:43.901 --> 00:24:49.683]  And you pick up the newspaper, and it's like, my son likes to play Army and Fort, but I'm gonna teach him to wear a dress.
[00:24:49.703 --> 00:24:50.664]  This is actually in the news.
[00:24:52.044 --> 00:24:54.025]  Because it's the right thing to do.
[00:24:56.746 --> 00:25:00.028]  So when the left goes, oh, let your son choose if they're a girl,
[00:25:00.834 --> 00:25:12.217]  These abusive leftists are doing this to their sons, and they're not just putting them on Ritalin to mess them up, but we're going to put you, son, on hormone blockers, because this is the cult we're in.
[00:25:12.237 --> 00:25:15.258]  Oh, because we're letting you choose?
[00:25:15.338 --> 00:25:16.218]  No, you're not choosing.
[00:25:16.238 --> 00:25:24.240]  You're following a super eugenics-based, humanity-ending program.
[00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:27.859]  And bragging about it.
[00:25:28.439 --> 00:25:33.721]  Now, I was going to come back in this segment, and I was going to get to this later, but everybody knows my habit of mentioning something coming up and getting right into it.
[00:25:33.761 --> 00:25:41.703]  But when we come back, constitutional lawyer, really smart cookie, founder of Oath Keepers, is going to be joining us, Stuart Rhodes.
[00:25:44.004 --> 00:25:49.965]  But here's the bottom line, and he's a constitutional lawyer, won awards at Yale for his writings, and of course worked for Ron Paul.
[00:25:50.385 --> 00:25:50.886]  Smart guy.
[00:25:51.206 --> 00:25:52.566]  He concurs with me with what I've said.
[00:25:53.686 --> 00:25:55.787]  Trump, essentially, is no longer the president.
[00:25:56.792 --> 00:25:58.793]  He has advocated his responsibility.
[00:25:58.833 --> 00:25:59.713]  He's signing it away.
[00:26:00.093 --> 00:26:05.175]  He's letting a group of people around him tell him that he can't fire the head of the Federal Reserve, which he can do in the code.
[00:26:07.296 --> 00:26:09.637]  He says, we're going to get our troops out of Syria.
[00:26:10.278 --> 00:26:11.538]  They say, no, you can't do that.
[00:26:12.959 --> 00:26:15.860]  He says, I'm going to declassify the illegal spying on me.
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:16.680]  No, you can't do that.
[00:26:18.341 --> 00:26:21.542]  And so for all intents and purposes, he's done a lot of bold stuff.
[00:26:21.582 --> 00:26:22.743]  Get us out of the TPP.
[00:26:24.323 --> 00:26:25.384]  He's done a lot of positive things.
[00:26:26.317 --> 00:26:29.818]  Fired the head of the World Bank, who was a CHICOM operative.
[00:26:31.078 --> 00:26:31.658]  We know he was.
[00:26:33.119 --> 00:26:51.643]  But, when it comes to him trying to really do key things like defend our country, and defend ourselves from the UN-funded, run, public invasion plan to collapse every major nation-state, he hires the people that supposedly are expert, it's in it like Kelly, and then Kelly won't do it!
[00:26:52.683 --> 00:26:53.523]  And then lies to him!
[00:26:55.848 --> 00:26:59.829]  And they're using hardcore intelligence agency operations and manuals against him.
[00:27:00.969 --> 00:27:07.591]  And they're messing with his whole family, and they're threatening him, and they're trying to destroy him, and they're scaring everybody around him to put pressure on him.
[00:27:07.851 --> 00:27:09.531]  So I don't want to be in his position.
[00:27:10.152 --> 00:27:12.652]  And he's under legendary stress, and I say pray for the president.
[00:27:12.752 --> 00:27:15.573]  But we all have to get down to brass tacks here.
[00:27:16.547 --> 00:27:20.730]  This is a 12-round heavyweight boxing match, and Trump is tied right now.
[00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:28.075]  And both contenders have got broken noses, eyebrows opened up, blood coming out of their mouths, and they're both leaning on the ropes.
[00:27:31.278 --> 00:27:32.879]  So, it goes either way.
[00:27:32.919 --> 00:27:36.602]  He's either going to be the liberator, and he's going to drop the hammer.
[00:27:38.061 --> 00:27:38.881]  Or he's going to go down.
[00:27:39.122 --> 00:27:52.128]  Because they're cutting him off, all the talk show hosts that support him, all the money that supports him, everything's being cut off ahead of assassination or him being impeached and then removed.
[00:27:53.328 --> 00:27:55.129]  And folks are like, oh, well, that'll be a spectacle.
[00:27:55.209 --> 00:27:55.389]  No.
[00:27:56.249 --> 00:28:00.011]  Everywhere, the authoritarian governments are dropping the hammer.
[00:28:02.132 --> 00:28:05.834]  In Europe, they're saying, we're going to ban demonstrations, period.
[00:28:06.912 --> 00:28:08.693]  By any conservative or nationalist group.
[00:28:09.653 --> 00:28:11.174]  And now they have police checkpoints.
[00:28:12.074 --> 00:28:16.056]  There's video of it on Infowars.com where they come up in Germany and France and say, are you a nationalist?
[00:28:16.076 --> 00:28:16.676]  Are you a right winger?
[00:28:16.696 --> 00:28:19.117]  And the women are like, well, no.
[00:28:19.177 --> 00:28:21.398]  They go, well, you know, you've got your hair braided.
[00:28:26.423 --> 00:28:29.265]  And the truth is, you're a white person in Germany, that's not allowed.
[00:28:29.706 --> 00:28:31.447]  And you see how people love to race war.
[00:28:32.007 --> 00:28:33.008]  So they're just flipping it now.
[00:28:33.609 --> 00:28:35.930]  Perfect for the Germans, where now it's get the white people.
[00:28:36.171 --> 00:28:39.093]  And I see on Twitter and stuff, they're saying, ban the German language.
[00:28:39.413 --> 00:28:40.914]  People now believe that's Nazi.
[00:28:41.355 --> 00:28:43.076]  There's an article right there.
[00:28:44.537 --> 00:28:46.298]  And people even have German football teams.
[00:28:46.378 --> 00:28:51.582]  In fact, the EU has said they're going to ban country names starting in two years on all the soccer teams.
[00:28:51.622 --> 00:28:52.984]  You see, this is it, folks.
[00:28:53.564 --> 00:28:55.646]  This is a total cult takeover.
[00:28:56.516 --> 00:29:00.802]  And we better realize we're in the fight for our lives against real authoritarians.
[00:29:08.209 --> 00:29:09.590]  Is it the end of our empire?
[00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:10.310]  Is that a good thing?
[00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:10.951]  Is that a bad thing?
[00:29:10.971 --> 00:29:14.933]  Because America's been an empire, but it's been absorbed in this big globalist empire.
[00:29:15.053 --> 00:29:16.914]  And are people smart enough to get out of it?
[00:29:17.635 --> 00:29:21.757]  There's an article here, The Life Cycles of Empires, Lessons for America Today.
[00:29:21.777 --> 00:29:25.160]  And the truth is, we've become extremely, extremely decadent.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.241]  We've become extremely over-entertained.
[00:29:27.421 --> 00:29:29.242]  And people can't differentiate from reality.
[00:29:29.262 --> 00:29:35.426]  And so I sit back and I ask myself, what will this country look like in 10 years, in 20 years, if we fail?
[00:29:35.706 --> 00:29:37.647]  Trump thought he could restart America.
[00:29:37.667 --> 00:29:38.748]  To a certain extent, we've done it.
[00:29:38.808 --> 00:29:48.495]  But when we kick-started the country, and its pulse came back to life, Trump was sure that if he could get that done, people would wake up out of their fog, wake up out of their leftist-induced coma, and that we could fix things.
[00:29:48.615 --> 00:29:49.996]  And we've seen that to a certain extent.
[00:29:50.036 --> 00:29:56.721]  But the propaganda, the election fraud, the vote-stealing, all of it is a green light to the establishment that no, Trump can be beat.
[00:29:56.841 --> 00:29:58.202]  And it's breathed new life into them.
[00:29:58.462 --> 00:30:00.103]  They've gotten away with the massive censorship.
[00:30:00.143 --> 00:30:01.964]  They've gotten away with the incredible divide-and-conquer.
[00:30:02.024 --> 00:30:04.145]  They've gotten away with weaponizing media.
[00:30:04.205 --> 00:30:09.328]  They've gotten away with telling incredible lies stacked on more lies until you're just living in total fantasy land.
[00:30:09.468 --> 00:30:12.009]  So what do you think the world's gonna look like in 20 years?
[00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:27.778]  If we've already got world government pushing implantable microchips to buy and sell, and global social score is already here, and all the big tech giants tracking everything you do and putting it into huge databases, and trying to destroy middle-class wealth and really create a horrible future where everything is consolidated.
[00:30:27.978 --> 00:30:30.979]  What will the dystopia look like if we fail?
[00:30:31.019 --> 00:30:36.841]  Of course, some will say, many will say, well, it's in the Bible that the Antichrist wages war against the saints and overcomes them.
[00:30:36.961 --> 00:30:41.902]  And for a short time, there's a planetary world government that if God didn't come back and stop it all, no flesh would be spared.
[00:30:42.062 --> 00:30:43.182]  Okay, well, when is that coming?
[00:30:43.423 --> 00:30:44.583]  What's that period look like?
[00:30:45.023 --> 00:30:59.911]  Shouldn't we, if that's the case, and the proper interpretation, be warning everybody about the world government, about the microchip, about the beast system, so less you'd be saved, you would be deceived, you would be given over to a great delusion that 2 plus 2 equals 5, and that women are men and men are women?
[00:31:00.131 --> 00:31:02.052]  We're on a planet in deep space, and
[00:31:02.552 --> 00:31:08.994]  We are under the control of some very nasty people, who the Bible tells us have been given power by the Father of Lies, the God of this world.
[00:31:09.014 --> 00:31:16.137]  A fallen one that fell to this planet, who's trapped on this planet, and can only have dominion over us, not over the big boy out in space.
[00:31:16.237 --> 00:31:28.221]  And you sit back from a scientific cosmology, and you sit back and see what the globals are building, and man, if it isn't exactly what God told the prophets to warn us about, I'll eat my hat.
[00:31:37.662 --> 00:31:38.843]  Sandy in Minnesota.
[00:31:38.863 --> 00:31:40.264]  Thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[00:31:40.385 --> 00:31:40.885]  Hi, Alex.
[00:31:41.005 --> 00:31:43.327]  Two years I've waited to talk to you.
[00:31:43.387 --> 00:31:44.248]  What an honor it is.
[00:31:44.368 --> 00:31:46.851]  And I'd like to tell you that your products are amazing.
[00:31:46.891 --> 00:31:49.914]  They're absolutely game changers in everything that you do.
[00:31:49.934 --> 00:31:51.715]  I have the Silver Bullet.
[00:31:51.835 --> 00:31:54.258]  I have the nice Iodine, the Secret 12.
[00:31:54.318 --> 00:31:55.319]  Your new Happy is
[00:31:55.919 --> 00:31:56.580]  Unbelievable.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.967]  The flora life, my daughter suffers from IBS really bad and it took it away.
[00:32:01.107 --> 00:32:02.769]  Totally not a problem anymore.
[00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:05.533]  And then she got a cut, a pretty bad paper cut the other day.
[00:32:05.673 --> 00:32:07.396]  Long story short, it was infected.
[00:32:07.616 --> 00:32:08.337]  Put it on there.
[00:32:08.457 --> 00:32:10.861]  Two days later, it was scabbed up and almost peeled over.
[00:32:11.061 --> 00:32:14.542]  Oh, I gotta tell you, I don't mean to digress on the products, but I'm not a big cat person.
[00:32:14.562 --> 00:32:16.383]  My mom had cats growing up and dogs.
[00:32:16.463 --> 00:32:19.885]  My wife has two cats, and we got another male cat that was a kitten.
[00:32:19.945 --> 00:32:20.545]  Now it's big.
[00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:22.766]  It fights with the older tabby that's 14 pounds.
[00:32:22.846 --> 00:32:24.467]  So the other night, there's this huge fight in the living room.
[00:32:24.507 --> 00:32:31.469]  I go out there, and I try to pull him apart, and the bigger one climbs up my arm, pushes off, tears it completely open.
[00:32:31.629 --> 00:32:34.791]  And I've had cat scratches before that took three, four weeks to heal.
[00:32:34.991 --> 00:32:36.291]  It's like 70% healed.
[00:32:38.032 --> 00:32:43.656]  In only like eight, nine days, and I'm telling you, I put the silver wound gel and the colloidal silver all over.
[00:32:43.676 --> 00:32:45.177]  The silver wound gel is specifically made for that.
[00:32:45.677 --> 00:32:48.439]  And it just, because you know how dirty cats are, their back paws.
[00:32:48.459 --> 00:32:52.401]  I don't want to go into the details here, but yes, silver is critical.
[00:32:52.421 --> 00:32:55.583]  Yes, and I also have the toothpaste, and that's really amazing, too.
[00:32:55.783 --> 00:32:57.104]  Your products are amazing.
[00:32:57.124 --> 00:33:00.066]  They're absolutely game changers in everything that you do.
[00:33:07.071 --> 00:33:22.599]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:31.463]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:47.657 --> 00:33:50.299]  This is not a sensational headline or statement.
[00:33:50.439 --> 00:33:51.239]  It's the fact.
[00:33:51.339 --> 00:33:55.762]  President Trump is essentially no longer the president.
[00:33:57.102 --> 00:34:01.084]  He is abdicating his responsibility.
[00:34:02.665 --> 00:34:07.228]  He is being countermanded by his subordinates.
[00:34:08.809 --> 00:34:15.813]  He is being gelded and isolated and all of his supporters being cut off and silenced ahead of assassination.
[00:34:17.111 --> 00:34:18.371]  Or, removal from office.
[00:34:18.952 --> 00:34:20.632]  And you say, well, why would they remove a puppet?
[00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:25.073]  Well, because his rhetoric they don't like, and he's still fighting hard.
[00:34:25.593 --> 00:34:32.675]  You know, Tucker Carlson, about three weeks ago, came out and said, I really like Trump, think he means well, but he doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:34:33.555 --> 00:34:36.136]  He doesn't understand how Washington works, and they're running circles around him.
[00:34:36.916 --> 00:34:43.818]  He means well, he's gotten a lot done just because he's outside the box and gets that he's the president, but
[00:34:45.174 --> 00:34:47.095]  He says, pull the troops out.
[00:34:47.415 --> 00:34:48.475]  They just say, no, we're not doing it.
[00:34:49.036 --> 00:34:52.597]  He says, release the FISA documents, the illegal spying.
[00:34:52.617 --> 00:34:53.117]  They won't do it.
[00:34:54.117 --> 00:34:56.919]  Pence and he and others signaled, hey, we're already in an emergency.
[00:34:56.999 --> 00:34:57.959]  I may declare an emergency.
[00:34:58.219 --> 00:35:01.920]  And the word was, he's already said to the military, we're in an emergency on the border.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:02.381]  Get down there.
[00:35:02.401 --> 00:35:04.561]  And he announced we're in an emergency a few weeks ago.
[00:35:04.621 --> 00:35:12.024]  But the technical emergency, under law, Obama put in a string of executive orders starting in 2009, the biggest 2012.
[00:35:15.385 --> 00:35:21.691]  Saying we're in a national emergency and telling Congress that, and the President then acted under those emergency powers.
[00:35:22.271 --> 00:35:26.515]  And as Senator Manchin and others said, who's a Democrat, Trump has the power to do it.
[00:35:26.755 --> 00:35:27.596]  Yesterday on Fox.
[00:35:28.196 --> 00:35:31.939]  He said, I don't know if he'll do it, and if Congress thinks the President has too much power, they should take it.
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.161]  They should pass some laws.
[00:35:34.201 --> 00:35:35.582]  But too much power has been ceded.
[00:35:36.183 --> 00:35:40.226]  Okay, well they've been using the power to bring us into this globalist system.
[00:35:40.707 --> 00:35:41.748]  Trump has used the power.
[00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.899]  To pull us out of it, but he didn't do it.
[00:35:47.319 --> 00:35:47.800]  He balked.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.161]  Now, maybe he's gonna do it in a few weeks.
[00:35:50.062 --> 00:35:54.187]  But you know, a few weeks turns into a few months, like declassifying the illegal spying on him.
[00:35:55.989 --> 00:35:59.953]  I even heard Trump a month ago go, well, the Federal Reserve's separate, so I'm really not supposed to get involved in that.
[00:35:59.993 --> 00:36:00.934]  That's their propaganda.
[00:36:01.114 --> 00:36:02.135]  That's the Federal Reserve Act.
[00:36:02.616 --> 00:36:03.617]  That's not part of our country.
[00:36:03.857 --> 00:36:06.840]  The President can remove the head of the Fed for any reason he wants.
[00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.481]  It's in there!
[00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:13.695]  So he's surrounded by people that are lying to him and who are countermanding what he says.
[00:36:13.775 --> 00:36:16.097]  And so I say this to all the listeners and everybody else.
[00:36:16.358 --> 00:36:17.319]  You need to call the White House.
[00:36:17.339 --> 00:36:18.139]  You need to write letters.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.282]  You need to call talk radio and get the talking point out there.
[00:36:21.563 --> 00:36:29.510]  Why they want us off air is because we can put these talking points out that Trump is no longer the president when he acts like this.
[00:36:30.393 --> 00:36:31.914]  He's lying still to be surrounded and cut off.
[00:36:32.215 --> 00:36:37.159]  But he can always, before it's too late, slip back in and start exercising that rightful power.
[00:36:37.199 --> 00:36:46.868]  And this is, so many people spin this, Stuart Rhodes, founder, vote keepers, constitutional lawyer, army veteran, for folks that don't know who he is.
[00:36:46.928 --> 00:36:47.789]  You're a constitutional lawyer.
[00:36:47.889 --> 00:36:48.370]  I've studied this.
[00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:49.190]  We know what's going on.
[00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:50.111]  We know about the executive order.
[00:36:50.131 --> 00:36:51.733]  We're going to go over it in this segment and the next.
[00:36:52.794 --> 00:36:55.016]  But sitting back from this,
[00:36:57.628 --> 00:36:59.150]  What do you think the president needs to do?
[00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:00.231]  What did you make of that speech?
[00:37:00.692 --> 00:37:02.073]  Why do you think he reversed course?
[00:37:02.854 --> 00:37:07.359]  Do you think I'm going too far saying, for all intents and purposes, he's no longer the president when he acts like this?
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.423]  And then what needs to happen to those that aren't following his orders?
[00:37:10.823 --> 00:37:13.706]  And then others spin it and say, oh, we're calling for martial law.
[00:37:14.327 --> 00:37:15.468]  We're calling for civil emergency.
[00:37:15.508 --> 00:37:17.931]  No, we're already under the emergency, as you know.
[00:37:18.872 --> 00:37:22.914]  Under law, the president has to declare his own just to end the previous emergency.
[00:37:22.954 --> 00:37:24.535]  So how do we articulate that?
[00:37:24.995 --> 00:37:26.216]  What do you think is happening with Trump?
[00:37:26.556 --> 00:37:27.977]  And how serious is his situation?
[00:37:29.172 --> 00:37:33.415]  Well, as we discussed last night, I was very disappointed that he didn't do what needs to be done.
[00:37:33.475 --> 00:37:38.718]  And what he needs to do is recognize this is a military national emergency on our southern border.
[00:37:39.179 --> 00:37:45.323]  And he needs to directly draw a parallel to the precedent of President Wilson in 1916 sending the U.S.
[00:37:45.443 --> 00:37:50.186]  Army across the border into Mexico to go chase down Pancho Villa and his bandits.
[00:37:50.686 --> 00:37:51.326]  We're good to go.
[00:38:11.352 --> 00:38:17.757]  I am authorized to repel invasions, to suppress insurrections, and execute the laws of the Union, and I can use the U.S.
[00:38:17.777 --> 00:38:25.963]  military to do so as Commander-in-Chief, then he needs to turn to his Defense Department and give out the order to go and deploy the military on the border in force.
[00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:33.089]  Not in a support role, not here and there, but en masse, as was done by Wilson in reaction to Pancho Villa.
[00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:38.313]  He sent an expeditionary force, in a punitive expedition, into Mexico to go take it to the bandits.
[00:38:38.653 --> 00:38:40.694]  And today, we're in the same situation again.
[00:38:40.974 --> 00:38:46.097]  You have, in that situation, you had Pancho Villa and his men who controlled northern Mexico.
[00:38:46.118 --> 00:38:51.040]  They were the de facto rulers of northern Mexico in a civil war against the Mexican government, against Mexico City.
[00:38:51.621 --> 00:38:53.942]  And they didn't wait for Mexico City's permission.
[00:38:54.482 --> 00:38:55.963]  You know, Wilson sent the troops across the border.
[00:38:55.983 --> 00:38:58.385]  He didn't wait for Congress's permission or authority.
[00:38:58.485 --> 00:39:05.369]  He just did it as the Commander-in-Chief in an obvious constitutional response to an invasion, a murder of American citizens.
[00:39:05.689 --> 00:39:06.409]  Here's the same.
[00:39:06.449 --> 00:39:13.613]  The cartels have come into the United States, brought illegal aliens in who are their gangbanger buddies, who then murder police officers, murder veterans.
[00:39:13.953 --> 00:39:19.876]  Last night he talked about, you know, an Air Force veteran who was a female who was raped and murdered, beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien.
[00:39:20.156 --> 00:39:33.403]  Then he had a police officer, Singh, up there, a legal immigrant from Fiji, who was murdered by an illegal immigrant under California's protection with their ridiculous sovereign, you know, they call it the sanctuary state law.
[00:39:34.003 --> 00:39:37.625]  So all of this is the same parallel to what we face with Pancho Villa.
[00:39:37.645 --> 00:39:38.785]  Well, this is a much bigger threat.
[00:39:38.805 --> 00:39:40.186]  We've got 35 million illegal aliens.
[00:39:40.206 --> 00:39:41.587]  They're twice as likely to commit crimes.
[00:39:42.027 --> 00:39:46.789]  Mexico and Latin America are crime, kidnapping, beheading, murder paradises.
[00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:48.410]  Hundreds of thousands of dead.
[00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:52.532]  And then you've got the Democrats, an upside-down world, saying there's zero crisis on the border.
[00:39:52.792 --> 00:39:53.512]  There's nothing happening.
[00:39:53.532 --> 00:39:54.152]  But even the U.N.
[00:39:54.172 --> 00:40:01.396]  admits record numbers of flu, tuberculosis, drug-resistant, black plague, even
[00:40:02.636 --> 00:40:03.797]  Leprosy is coming back.
[00:40:05.038 --> 00:40:08.460]  They're putting these kids in schools untested with other people's kids.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.921]  Worldwide tuberculosis exploding.
[00:40:11.561 --> 00:40:14.023]  This is just insane, but it's part of a larger plan.
[00:40:15.222 --> 00:40:16.043]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:16.123 --> 00:40:17.524]  And we see it already in Europe.
[00:40:18.145 --> 00:40:28.134]  As you said earlier, this is the globalist plan to flood the first world with the third world, and swamp it, and destroy it, and take it down to third world level.
[00:40:28.154 --> 00:40:29.535]  And that's what they're doing to us.
[00:40:30.076 --> 00:40:32.979]  But it's also a humanitarian crisis for the people being brought across.
[00:40:33.539 --> 00:40:38.882]  Trump has not hammered enough on the sex slavery that goes on both inside Mexico and inside the U.S.
[00:40:38.902 --> 00:40:39.762]  Oh, that's another thing.
[00:40:39.822 --> 00:40:50.867]  Schumer and all them said Trump's talking about non-existent sex trafficking when the AP reported on Democrat-connected groups sneaking 10,000 kids out of Haiti and some of them found dead.
[00:40:51.167 --> 00:40:57.350]  And even the Senate reported, Mitch, Obama let in tens of thousands of kids, thousands of which disappeared into sex slavery.
[00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.951]  I mean, and they're saying there is no Christ on the border.
[00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:01.412]  There is no sex slavery.
[00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:03.893]  These people are a mad criminal group.
[00:41:03.974 --> 00:41:16.422]  It's just, and they look like, I mean, the way Pelosi and Schumer looked, the whole nation recoiled because they look like, like, animatomic dummies or something, like they're not real.
[00:41:16.682 --> 00:41:17.783]  What the hell's going on here?
[00:41:19.042 --> 00:41:31.012]  Well, you know, there's been well-documented over the mainstream media for many years of the sad tale of young girls, underage, being kidnapped, beaten and raped, and smuggled into the U.S.
[00:41:31.052 --> 00:41:35.636]  and forced to be prostitutes in the sex slavery for the illegal migrant workers.
[00:41:35.676 --> 00:41:40.580]  They go to these fields and they have to service, you know, 30 men at a time, every day.
[00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:44.464]  They're being tortured every day sexually, in the United States, not in Mexico.
[00:41:44.824 --> 00:41:46.565]  That's not conspiracy theory.
[00:41:46.706 --> 00:41:47.586]  Oh, let me stop you.
[00:41:47.626 --> 00:41:53.971]  CBS was so hyper to lie about Trump with their Southern Provincial Law Center fact-checkers that they put their foot in their mouth last night.
[00:41:54.191 --> 00:41:56.012]  Stories on Infowars.com we'll cover when we come back.
[00:41:56.493 --> 00:42:08.042]  Stewart, did you see where he said one in three women coming up through Mexico were raped by the coyotes and CBS fact-checked them and said actually it's 80 percent, which it is.
[00:42:08.062 --> 00:42:11.004]  And so then they had to pull it down.
[00:42:11.024 --> 00:42:12.445]  I mean, can you believe it?
[00:42:14.542 --> 00:42:18.226]  Yeah, this is, you know, everyone on the border knows.
[00:42:18.386 --> 00:42:22.390]  I think the problem is most of America doesn't realize how bad it really is.
[00:42:22.711 --> 00:42:23.752]  It is far worse.
[00:42:23.852 --> 00:42:28.096]  I'm a full-grown man and I've been down there with folks in Arizona and South Texas and it's scary.
[00:42:29.498 --> 00:42:29.958]  It's scary down there.
[00:42:31.474 --> 00:42:35.035]  It's far worse than what was going on in Pancho Villa, because they don't leave.
[00:42:35.095 --> 00:42:38.317]  They stay here, and they do the same thing here they do in Mexico.
[00:42:38.617 --> 00:42:41.378]  They terrorize women and children, they force them into sex slavery.
[00:42:42.058 --> 00:42:44.059]  If they try to escape, they murder them.
[00:42:44.559 --> 00:42:45.339]  Let's make an example.
[00:42:45.379 --> 00:42:46.500]  And let's be clear, let's be clear.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:59.705]  It's because it's the worst of the worst of Latin America and other places knowing you can go to the United States and no one knows who you are and do whatever the hell you want, like the railway killer who killed 30-something people, all of them Hispanics.
[00:43:03.033 --> 00:43:07.237]  In the last eight years, we've seen the rise and now fall of the cryptocurrencies.
[00:43:08.198 --> 00:43:14.123]  And the entire time, I refused to take sponsors to fund our operation from the cryptocurrency market.
[00:43:14.584 --> 00:43:24.013]  Not because I thought every company was bad or that the whole thing's a scam, but at a gut level, I knew it was a giant bubble and I didn't want to be associated with that.
[00:43:24.513 --> 00:43:25.734]  Gut level, just couldn't do it.
[00:43:26.275 --> 00:43:28.577]  There have been many other sponsors I've refused.
[00:43:29.137 --> 00:43:45.554]  I have been offered and refused millions of dollars in sponsorship that would have been great to fight the info war from legitimate companies that sell marijuana-derived CBD oil, which has incredible attributes everybody knows about on so many fronts and helps a lot of people.
[00:43:46.169 --> 00:43:54.473]  But the reason I haven't gotten involved is the law hasn't been clear and some states, even though it doesn't get you high, see it as illegal.
[00:43:55.254 --> 00:44:15.125]  But now, they have developed and certified for years CBD rich oil derived from hemp that is completely legal in all 50 states and there are so many different permutations and combinations of what it's able to do and what the studies show it's done that it's mind-blowing.
[00:44:15.905 --> 00:44:22.870]  So we've worked with one of the biggest companies in the nation, and they wanted to just work with us openly because they want to stand up for America and freedom.
[00:44:22.911 --> 00:44:23.491]  They're patriots.
[00:44:23.511 --> 00:44:35.240]  But I said, listen, you just need to create your own new website for a private label for us, where you handle it all, where they get the best hemp-derived CBD oil, legal in all 50 states, from you.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.422]  You drop ship it, you get it out, you have the website.
[00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:43.927]  I promote it, I send people there, and that way they're getting the very best from the experts.
[00:44:44.607 --> 00:44:45.588]  So again, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:44:45.768 --> 00:44:48.089]  Nothing wrong with marijuana-derived CBD oil.
[00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:58.815]  The problem is, some of the public and governments and municipalities get confused, and sometimes people get in trouble with CBD oil if it's too strong.
[00:44:59.576 --> 00:45:04.318]  This isn't CBD oil derived from marijuana that's high in THC.
[00:45:04.598 --> 00:45:09.621]  This is derived from industrial, high-quality, organic hemp.
[00:45:10.321 --> 00:45:12.242]  And it's legal in all 50 states.
[00:45:12.383 --> 00:45:12.683]  And now,
[00:45:13.888 --> 00:45:23.977]  Trump has signed the executive order allowing the industrial growing of hemp so we won't even have to import it from Canada to Colorado where it's then produced, bottled, and distributed.
[00:45:24.277 --> 00:45:26.119]  Now listen, I know a lot about it.
[00:45:26.159 --> 00:45:26.739]  I've researched it.
[00:45:26.779 --> 00:45:32.244]  I've turned down probably 20, 30 companies who've been wanting to sponsor us the last six years.
[00:45:32.324 --> 00:45:33.665]  It's gotten really crazy the last two.
[00:45:34.486 --> 00:45:46.424]  But now that the law is clear, now that our listeners can't get burned, now that we have a partnership with one of the top companies in the United States known for their organic quality, known for being patriots,
[00:45:47.688 --> 00:45:55.554]  They have created a new website and a private label of their entire spectrum of award-winning products called Washington's Reserve.
[00:45:56.234 --> 00:46:12.465]  And there are so many attributes, so many different things that hemp-derived, hemp-rich CBD oil has to offer that you just need to go to washingtonsreserve.com for yourself and see it all because they have more than 40 products.
[00:46:12.826 --> 00:46:15.588]  Now remember, the Globalists have tried to take our merchant accounts away.
[00:46:15.788 --> 00:46:16.789]  They've tried to shut us down.
[00:46:17.569 --> 00:46:18.770]  They've tried to boycott us.
[00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:19.590]  They've tried to sue us.
[00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:26.593]  And I said in the last six months, I'm going to move not away from a direct sales marketing of great products to you to fund us.
[00:46:26.813 --> 00:46:27.534]  We're still going to do that.
[00:46:27.814 --> 00:46:28.734]  Then ForrestLife.com.
[00:46:28.954 --> 00:46:34.577]  But we're also going to bring on the best sponsors in the country, the very best products.
[00:46:34.677 --> 00:46:36.498]  And this is the first big one.
[00:46:36.858 --> 00:46:37.718]  So I'm very excited.
[00:46:37.738 --> 00:46:38.519]  Be sure and go there.
[00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:45.242]  Experience the power of high quality hemp extract with CBD exclusively available at washingtonsreserve.com for the
[00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:47.744]  So, highest quality, the lowest prices.
[00:46:48.185 --> 00:46:53.970]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, at WashingtonReserve.com, and you're helping fund the InfoWar the whole time.
[00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:58.875]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:18.816 --> 00:47:20.477]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:20.957 --> 00:47:23.758]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[00:47:31.941 --> 00:47:40.905]  Stuart Rhodes, constitutional lawyer, army veteran, founder of Oath Keepers, a good friend of mine, a great patriot, is breaking down the fact that the president is not acting like the president.
[00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:43.786]  And we have these bureaucracies ignoring his orders.
[00:47:45.038 --> 00:47:53.584]  He's written award-winning papers at Yale, and you name it, about the different structures of power in the executive of the other two branches.
[00:47:53.905 --> 00:47:58.248]  We'll get his take on that in a moment, but he was just bringing up the massive human smuggling.
[00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:06.114]  We were doing live coverage last night, with Stewart and others on with us, Roger Stone and others, of the aftermath of the president.
[00:48:07.415 --> 00:48:12.959]  And the Democrats responded by saying, there's no human smuggling.
[00:48:14.517 --> 00:48:17.158]  Those are quotes, and Trump's making it up.
[00:48:17.178 --> 00:48:18.719]  There's, quote, no border crisis.
[00:48:18.739 --> 00:48:21.580]  This is official statements at MSNBC and CNN.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.022]  I mean, this is otherworldly.
[00:48:25.062 --> 00:48:28.484]  This level of BS is so seismic, I don't even know what you call it.
[00:48:29.504 --> 00:48:31.245]  It's BS to the power of infinity.
[00:48:32.686 --> 00:48:39.309]  The UN even admits, because they're involved, Amnesty International, 80% of the women that come up through there are raped in Mexico.
[00:48:40.305 --> 00:48:41.145]  Not by the gringos.
[00:48:41.886 --> 00:48:43.886]  Tens of thousands are put into sex slavery every year.
[00:48:44.207 --> 00:48:45.487]  Thousands get killed and disappear.
[00:48:45.907 --> 00:48:50.249]  Trump just signed an anti-human smuggling piece of legislation that also goes after pedophiles.
[00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:55.991]  Pedophile arrests are up nine to ten times, according to federal numbers, what they were under Obama.
[00:48:56.472 --> 00:49:04.235]  But there's a cover of magazines, like Texas Monthly, say Jones is insane, there's no pedophilia.
[00:49:05.335 --> 00:49:06.976]  With a picture of myself and Trump up there.
[00:49:08.353 --> 00:49:10.694]  And then it says Pizzagate isn't real, there's no pedophilia.
[00:49:11.454 --> 00:49:16.175]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump just signed the legislation, so he is taking action, he is the President.
[00:49:16.575 --> 00:49:26.818]  But compared to the real powers he has as Commander-in-Chief, when he puts that hat on in an emergency, both domestic or foreign, that's what scares the deep state because he could brush them aside if he just does it.
[00:49:27.558 --> 00:49:34.020]  Instead, instead of doing it, he leaves it in the big battle with Congress, and leaves Obama's emergency in place.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:35.500]  And I know he knows this!
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:40.801]  So we'll get Stuart's take on it, and what he thinks we should do, and also how the military can build a wall very, very quickly.
[00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:41.862]  Stuart's an expert on this.
[00:49:42.522 --> 00:49:47.163]  We'll get to that, but here's the President, just minutes ago, signing the anti-trafficking legislation.
[00:49:47.343 --> 00:49:48.263]  I very much do.
[00:49:48.303 --> 00:49:48.664]  Thank you.
[00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:03.831]  Okay.
[00:50:12.961 --> 00:50:14.042]  Stuart, this is incredible.
[00:50:15.264 --> 00:50:17.206]  Let's get back to the driving and how to build the wall.
[00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:24.442]  We know the United States is arguably the biggest place in the world for human trafficking because of our poorest borders.
[00:50:25.602 --> 00:50:26.702]  If not number one, we're number two.
[00:50:27.802 --> 00:50:32.103]  The Democrats, I have the stacks of news, I have video clips, mainstream media saying it doesn't exist.
[00:50:32.264 --> 00:50:33.504]  There is no human trafficking.
[00:50:33.724 --> 00:50:34.624]  There is no crime.
[00:50:35.324 --> 00:50:36.365]  There is no caravan.
[00:50:36.405 --> 00:50:38.405]  These are all, what the hell is going on here?
[00:50:38.745 --> 00:50:41.526]  What is the propaganda program here?
[00:50:42.779 --> 00:50:51.501]  Well, they can't admit the truth because then it backs up that this is an emergency and the proper response is to use the military to stop it.
[00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:52.942]  So of course, what else can they do?
[00:50:52.982 --> 00:50:53.842]  They can deny it.
[00:50:54.262 --> 00:51:01.023]  So you should take a page out of Ross Perot's book and get up in front of the press conference in front of the country and put it up on a big screen.
[00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:10.106]  All of the mainstream media reports and interviews of women being sex trafficked when they were children, brought across the country, finally freed and then interviewed.
[00:51:10.166 --> 00:51:11.046]  They're all over the place.
[00:51:11.426 --> 00:51:12.367]  He should lay them all out.
[00:51:12.407 --> 00:51:20.992]  He should show pictures of all the murders that happened both inside Mexico and inside the United States by the cartels and the drug gangs that run the border.
[00:51:21.392 --> 00:51:24.214]  And when he goes down to the border tomorrow, he should go to McAllen, Texas.
[00:51:24.254 --> 00:51:25.695]  He should go down to Laredo.
[00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:28.396]  He should go where, you know, we did a flyover with your crew.
[00:51:29.017 --> 00:51:31.878]  Your cameraman came along with me and flew over the Rio Grande.
[00:51:31.898 --> 00:51:32.859]  It's wide open.
[00:51:33.099 --> 00:51:34.040]  You still have that footage.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.281]  There's no fence there.
[00:51:35.301 --> 00:51:36.821]  There was no Border Patrol for miles.
[00:51:36.861 --> 00:51:40.784]  We flew for about 45 minutes before we saw one Border Patrol truck.
[00:51:41.284 --> 00:51:42.945]  And that's because there's not enough of them down there.
[00:51:42.965 --> 00:51:45.426]  Then we did boots on the ground walking along the Rio Grande.
[00:51:45.446 --> 00:51:46.806]  You wouldn't even know it's a border.
[00:51:47.126 --> 00:51:49.887]  There's nothing to indicate any kind of international border whatsoever.
[00:51:50.347 --> 00:51:55.789]  And we were there for about 45 minutes, me and a Marine Corps veteran who lives there, before we saw any War Patrol agents.
[00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:57.990]  They were just not there because there's not enough of them.
[00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:02.612]  And we've got footage of giant packages of drugs being brought across while we're there.
[00:52:03.772 --> 00:52:04.692]  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[00:52:04.712 --> 00:52:08.394]  You guys had, uh, I think it was Joe Gibbs, or Biggs, right?
[00:52:08.814 --> 00:52:12.016]  He saw the caravan come right across right in front of him, a bunch of mule trains.
[00:52:12.416 --> 00:52:17.918]  And so they bring drugs, they bring weapons, they bring women and children for sex slavery, they bring across terrorism.
[00:52:17.978 --> 00:52:19.939]  I mean, anything that they want to bring comes across.
[00:52:20.319 --> 00:52:22.360]  And the cartels control that border.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.081]  They control both sides of it.
[00:52:24.441 --> 00:52:25.722]  The gangs on the U.S.
[00:52:25.782 --> 00:52:34.690]  side who work for the cartels, some of them American citizens, others of them illegal aliens, are the ones who distribute the drugs and take them up to Chicago for the cartels.
[00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:37.712]  And on the Mexican side, it's the bloodthirsty cartels themselves.
[00:52:38.133 --> 00:52:39.814]  So they control the border right now.
[00:52:39.874 --> 00:52:41.555]  You're already being invaded and occupied.
[00:52:41.856 --> 00:52:49.222]  And you have corrupt sheriffs down there and police chiefs and city council members who are in the back pocket of the cartel because it's the standard drill.
[00:52:49.682 --> 00:52:51.884]  Either Plato or Plomo.
[00:52:51.944 --> 00:52:52.924]  Either silver or lead.
[00:52:52.944 --> 00:52:54.665]  You take their money, or they kill you.
[00:52:54.685 --> 00:52:56.827]  That's what's happening inside the U.S.
[00:52:56.987 --> 00:52:58.168]  as it does in Mexico.
[00:52:58.328 --> 00:53:00.750]  There is no border, and there will not be a border.
[00:53:19.842 --> 00:53:20.382]  It's crazy.
[00:53:21.203 --> 00:53:31.348]  That's why you should just take the time to do a press conference where he lays it all out there using their own reports, Amnesty International's reports, the UN's reports, you know, documented government reports about the reality on the border.
[00:53:31.388 --> 00:53:32.228]  Here are the facts.
[00:53:32.668 --> 00:53:37.911]  I mean the webpage they have up about border facts is pretty good, but he needs to get up there in front of the people and show it to the people.
[00:53:38.251 --> 00:53:40.453]  And then he needs to point out that that Wilson did this.
[00:53:40.553 --> 00:53:44.236]  Here's Black Jack Pershing in Mexico chasing down Pancho Villa.
[00:53:44.516 --> 00:53:46.658]  Here's why this is perfectly constitutional.
[00:53:46.678 --> 00:53:51.242]  And in fact, you know, my duty as the President of the United States to use the military to do this.
[00:53:51.662 --> 00:53:55.165]  And then he needs to go ahead and just do it right there from the stage and get it done.
[00:53:55.185 --> 00:53:56.206]  You're a smart guy.
[00:53:56.246 --> 00:53:58.007]  You've worked in Congress, you're a constitutional lawyer.
[00:53:58.668 --> 00:54:01.650]  They were signaling, both the Vice President and the President, he was going to declare an emergency.
[00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:07.174]  It's the right thing to do, not just for the border, but for what he can do in government once he does that for good.
[00:54:08.015 --> 00:54:08.975]  And it's in his purview.
[00:54:09.136 --> 00:54:15.018]  Why do you think he then, because I'm rarely wrong, and it's fine when I am, I'll say I am, but I'm not even wrong.
[00:54:15.078 --> 00:54:17.119]  He says, we're going to pull out of Syria.
[00:54:17.199 --> 00:54:17.859]  Then they don't do it.
[00:54:17.879 --> 00:54:19.300]  Because they say, no, we're not doing it.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:21.201]  They're countermanding.
[00:54:21.261 --> 00:54:22.682]  So what do you think the president should do?
[00:54:22.702 --> 00:54:26.703]  And do you agree with me that, you know, we're seeing him kind of not hit on all cylinders.
[00:54:26.723 --> 00:54:29.505]  He does some good things, but other times he just gets blocked.
[00:54:29.565 --> 00:54:30.045]  It's amazing.
[00:54:31.246 --> 00:54:34.107]  Yeah, and he needs to fire anybody that refuses one of his orders.
[00:54:34.647 --> 00:54:36.667]  What's a lawful order should be fired immediately.
[00:54:37.247 --> 00:54:40.268]  And he needs to make that very clear that you either do what I say or you're gone.
[00:54:40.348 --> 00:54:42.348]  He can't go back on what he says he's going to do.
[00:54:42.368 --> 00:54:43.249]  He just needs to do it.
[00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:44.929]  So that's what he has to do.
[00:54:44.949 --> 00:54:45.749]  He has to man up.
[00:54:45.869 --> 00:54:49.010]  And I want to refer back to what you were saying earlier.
[00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:53.611]  It's part of their program to make us all despair and give up.
[00:54:54.051 --> 00:54:56.194]  And obviously they're doing that to him as well.
[00:54:56.495 --> 00:55:04.206]  That's why it's so important for us to make sure that we stand up and let our voices be heard and we go put our boots on the ground in D.C.
[00:55:04.466 --> 00:55:05.888]  calling on the President to man up.
[00:55:05.928 --> 00:55:06.810]  We gotta man up too.
[00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.032]  And don't give up.
[00:55:08.092 --> 00:55:10.215]  I saw some comments on your website after last night.
[00:55:10.715 --> 00:55:12.036]  People saying that they're giving up.
[00:55:12.076 --> 00:55:13.577]  Trump's not going to do anything.
[00:55:13.657 --> 00:55:14.378]  Our country's cooked.
[00:55:14.398 --> 00:55:16.940]  It doesn't make a difference what Trump does or doesn't do.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.140]  What matters is what you do.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.262]  Oh yeah, Nancy Pelosi's so tone-deaf.
[00:55:20.282 --> 00:55:22.003]  She doesn't know that she looks like the Crypt Keeper.
[00:55:22.423 --> 00:55:23.464]  And same thing with Schumer.
[00:55:24.084 --> 00:55:29.508]  They have this evil criminal will to dominate us, but if we just persevere, look how far the movement against globalism has come.
[00:55:29.528 --> 00:55:30.109]  Look at Trump.
[00:55:30.689 --> 00:55:37.393]  Yes, we're frustrated he doesn't just defeat them right now and he has the power in his hands, but he's working with a bunch of cowards that backstab, but you're absolutely right.
[00:55:37.713 --> 00:55:39.454]  Don't let them demoralize you, folks.
[00:55:39.854 --> 00:55:41.075]  Don't let them demoralize you.
[00:55:41.355 --> 00:55:45.017]  Nationalism and patriotism is exploding worldwide.
[00:55:45.077 --> 00:55:48.339]  Okay, yeah, the American Psychological Association say men are evil.
[00:55:48.579 --> 00:55:49.780]  Well, that shows us they're evil.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.461]  They're being honest about their plan.
[00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:56.344]  They're accelerating their timetable to bring down civilization for control because we're kicking their butt.
[00:55:57.631 --> 00:56:00.592]  Yeah, and the best response is to go and man up, you know?
[00:56:01.213 --> 00:56:07.856]  Take your testosterone pills, lift some weights, go run some sprints up a hill, go learn how to fight, and man up.
[00:56:07.936 --> 00:56:08.516]  Lose some weight.
[00:56:08.696 --> 00:56:18.240]  You know, this last year I lost 40 pounds, got my fat ass back in shape, and that's what we all need to do is just man up and see our responsibilities as individuals to make sure that we do what we have to do.
[00:56:18.801 --> 00:56:20.862]  And they're telling you what they don't want you to do.
[00:56:20.922 --> 00:56:23.383]  They don't want you to be a man anymore, so be a man.
[00:56:23.883 --> 00:56:24.383]  Exactly.
[00:56:24.423 --> 00:56:25.244]  What are they scared of?
[00:56:25.284 --> 00:56:26.945]  They don't want you to go to Infowars.com.
[00:56:26.965 --> 00:56:27.845]  They don't want you to be a Christian.
[00:56:27.865 --> 00:56:29.006]  They don't want you to be a nationalist.
[00:56:29.226 --> 00:56:30.266]  They don't want you to be a man.
[00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:32.608]  They don't want a woman to be a mother.
[00:56:33.348 --> 00:56:37.350]  Because they're demoralizing you because they are literally the scum of the earth.
[00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:43.013]  Do you believe the American Psychological Association has literally come out and said, men in traditional roles, period, are bad?
[00:56:43.193 --> 00:56:45.274]  We know that's been their plan, but now it's public.
[00:56:46.855 --> 00:56:51.077]  Yeah, I would encourage you as a new year's resolution, you know, read Jocko Willock's book, Discipline is Freedom.
[00:56:51.976 --> 00:56:56.761]  That's a great book about, you know, getting your act together mentally and physically and becoming men again.
[00:56:56.841 --> 00:56:58.743]  I think it's really important to focus on that.
[00:56:59.204 --> 00:57:00.585]  But we also need to push the President.
[00:57:00.685 --> 00:57:03.628]  We need to make sure we don't give him pass from what he did last night.
[00:57:04.129 --> 00:57:11.056]  Don't say, well, you know, it's not his fault, he's surrounded by, you know, whatever, enemies and they're in his ear, etc., etc.
[00:57:12.237 --> 00:57:13.257]  He's responsible.
[00:57:13.477 --> 00:57:15.018]  He needs to accept responsibility.
[00:57:15.138 --> 00:57:17.579]  Every one of us is responsible for what we do.
[00:57:17.879 --> 00:57:19.219]  And he's responsible also.
[00:57:19.239 --> 00:57:22.820]  I don't care what threats they're doing against his family or anything else.
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:23.761]  He swore that oath.
[00:57:24.141 --> 00:57:26.922]  Once he swore an oath of support in defending the Constitution, he's on the hook.
[00:57:27.222 --> 00:57:28.362]  He's on the hook from now on.
[00:57:28.682 --> 00:57:30.083]  And all he can do is do his duty.
[00:57:30.123 --> 00:57:30.923]  So all we can do too.
[00:57:31.889 --> 00:57:34.690]  Well, plus, Stuart, look at what we face.
[00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:37.432]  I know you've got to do another interview in about five minutes, but do five more with us back in two.
[00:57:38.852 --> 00:57:40.653]  How could the military build a wall very, very quickly?
[00:57:40.673 --> 00:57:41.654]  I know you're an expert on this.
[00:57:41.954 --> 00:57:46.316]  You spent thousands of hours on the border, more than thousands of hours, and we're going to break it all down.
[00:57:46.356 --> 00:57:47.056]  We come right back.
[00:57:47.116 --> 00:57:48.137]  Solutions straight ahead.
[00:57:56.385 --> 00:57:58.386]  Ladies and gentlemen, the new year is here.
[00:57:58.887 --> 00:58:13.977]  And I personally, in the new year, am looking at all the great supplements and products, and ForrestLife.com, and saying, what do I need to take religiously, that I'm forgetting to take, that lowers inflammation, that empowers all the cells in the body, that makes me healthier, better stamina, libido, energy?
[00:58:14.237 --> 00:58:15.218]  And it's these three babies.
[00:58:16.038 --> 00:58:19.860]  It's BODY's ultimate turmeric formula with 95% curcuminoid.
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:21.000]  Nobody else can top that.
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:22.421]  Top of the line in the nation.
[00:58:23.141 --> 00:58:28.963]  It's X3 that has all three of the good types of iodine together, including the deep earth crystal iodine.
[00:58:29.463 --> 00:58:31.484]  Because people can't absorb that type, we put
[00:58:31.764 --> 00:58:37.865]  A little bit of the other two types and a tiny bit of vitamin C to stabilize it, and then super male and super female vitality.
[00:58:38.306 --> 00:58:45.287]  Super male vitality has been our overall most successful product, neck and neck with BrainForce+.
[00:58:45.887 --> 00:58:52.069]  But because it's wildcrafted in a proprietary process, we weren't able to get it for long periods of time.
[00:58:52.969 --> 00:58:57.330]  And so I made the decision just to discontinue it and try to reformulate.
[00:58:57.850 --> 00:59:02.293]  But it's been very, very hard to do, so we're not discontinuing it because it's crap.
[00:59:02.433 --> 00:59:04.675]  We're discontinuing it because we can't get it.
[00:59:04.755 --> 00:59:08.658]  It may come back in the future, but right now, we're just not able to bring you this.
[00:59:08.718 --> 00:59:09.759]  It's our last run of it.
[00:59:10.439 --> 00:59:11.080]  Proprietary.
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:11.840]  Amazing.
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.501]  It's at M4WarsLife.com.
[00:59:13.962 --> 00:59:15.463]  M4Store.com's the umbrella site.
[00:59:16.063 --> 00:59:18.805]  Or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:59:19.286 --> 00:59:19.786]  Bodies.
[00:59:20.406 --> 00:59:20.947]  Turmeric.
[00:59:21.467 --> 00:59:21.948]  Formula.
[00:59:22.208 --> 00:59:24.710]  And it's supercharged with other key ingredients that
[00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:26.151]  Supercharge it.
[00:59:26.171 --> 00:59:26.931]  Bring it to the next level.
[00:59:27.652 --> 00:59:29.053]  And then, of course, it's the X3.
[00:59:29.453 --> 00:59:31.955]  It's our final run of X2.
[00:59:32.015 --> 00:59:43.363]  We've secured the Deep Earth Iodine, but I thought to make a better one with all three types and the Vitamin C. But, so get your X2, get your X3, all at MFULWARESTORE.COM or AAA253-3139.
[00:59:43.884 --> 00:59:45.145]  And again, have a great New Year's.
[00:59:45.185 --> 00:59:48.687]  We fight the globalists and restore the Republic and freedom to the planet.
[00:59:48.827 --> 00:59:49.288]  Thank you all.
[00:59:56.633 --> 01:00:00.576]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:00.636 --> 01:00:06.460]  Seems like yesterday, but it was long ago.
[01:00:27.298 --> 01:00:34.207]  This country is under globalist UN attack.
[01:00:34.287 --> 01:00:38.132]  They publicly admit they're using giant immigrant hordes to break down nations.
[01:00:38.152 --> 01:00:40.836]  I mean, socialist voters in Europe and the U.S.
[01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:44.360]  Revealed UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.402]  Infowars.com
[01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:52.411]  Tell folks, Stuart Rhodes, how the President could secure the border using the military.
[01:01:04.534 --> 01:01:09.737]  Well, what he could do is take a page out of Wilson's book and just deploy the military on the border.
[01:01:10.317 --> 01:01:15.539]  I'm not talking about support, I'm talking about line infantry units, Marine Corps, Army, on the border patrol.
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:24.104]  And I've talked to a very experienced Border Patrol agent just yesterday, in fact, who said that a precedent for it, as we did back in Operation Gatekeeper in the 90s,
[01:01:25.064 --> 01:01:31.370]  Where the Border Patrol beefed up from 500 men in the San Diego sector to 5,000, and they locked up the border there.
[01:01:31.671 --> 01:01:49.768]  And they did it with a layered system of a border barrier, a steel fence, the matting they used, and they put behind that a road that could be easily, you know, checked for footprints, and they drag and make it clean again, and make it check for footprints, and then a fence, and behind that another blank area, and then another fence.
[01:01:50.128 --> 01:01:50.728]  Sure, and the Feds have put up
[01:02:17.114 --> 01:02:19.515]  Cameras everywhere you can imagine except the border.
[01:02:19.995 --> 01:02:26.057]  It's very inexpensive and cheap now to just put in cameras, like you said, helicopters, and then all you do is slow people down.
[01:02:26.077 --> 01:02:29.878]  You have sand so you see where the footprints are, and then all you do is pick up the groups that come through.
[01:02:30.158 --> 01:02:41.662]  That's why they're trying to use mass wave attacks that the UN's organizing to try to overwhelm the entire system and then have images of our border broken to encourage the third world to swarm us, which is now happening.
[01:02:41.682 --> 01:02:44.683]  We're seeing the biggest numbers of illegals hitting our borders we've ever seen.
[01:02:45.922 --> 01:02:51.403]  Well, actually, I think the day-to-day grind across the entire border is already overwhelming the Border Patrol.
[01:02:51.624 --> 01:02:52.964]  There's simply not enough of them.
[01:02:52.984 --> 01:02:56.425]  And they have cameras along the McAllen sector, Laredo sector.
[01:02:56.445 --> 01:02:59.006]  They've got, you know, long, tall poles with cameras on them.
[01:02:59.226 --> 01:03:01.246]  But they don't have enough men to react.
[01:03:01.606 --> 01:03:04.947]  It doesn't make a difference how many cameras you have or how many blimps or drones.
[01:03:05.227 --> 01:03:08.088]  You've got to have enough men to react to go actually interdict.
[01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:15.412]  That's what they're missing is the manpower, which you could easily do with 101st Airborne could go down there with their helicopters and be a QRF force.
[01:03:15.432 --> 01:03:15.673]  The U.S.
[01:03:15.733 --> 01:03:19.615]  Marine Corps could go down there and very easily interdict with enough manpower.
[01:03:19.635 --> 01:03:20.896]  By the way, I'm not saying do this.
[01:03:20.976 --> 01:03:21.976]  I'm saying don't do it.
[01:03:22.237 --> 01:03:26.059]  Even the London Guardian admits Mexico's controlled its Guatemalan border until the U.N.
[01:03:26.079 --> 01:03:28.721]  just broke it last year by torturing people.
[01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:39.448]  Six months to a year hard labor and they torture the living hell out of you repeatedly when they capture you and when they let you go and that's what kept people from doing it was they were afraid of the Mexican federales.
[01:03:39.788 --> 01:03:40.569]  Now they're not afraid.
[01:03:40.629 --> 01:03:43.391]  The UN has effectively broken Mexico's border.
[01:03:44.611 --> 01:03:48.874]  Well, frankly, what I think Trump should do is deploy the military into Mexico.
[01:03:49.315 --> 01:03:52.357]  He should point out that Mexico does not control the border any longer.
[01:03:52.377 --> 01:03:53.037]  The cartels.
[01:03:53.057 --> 01:03:53.718]  It's a failed state.
[01:03:53.938 --> 01:03:55.038]  So what, move them in 10 miles, 20 miles?
[01:03:56.528 --> 01:03:57.610]  Yeah, 10 or 20 miles.
[01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:58.772]  Go in after the cartels.
[01:03:59.273 --> 01:04:00.415]  Seize all the major roads.
[01:04:00.475 --> 01:04:01.457]  Wipe out all the cartels.
[01:04:01.757 --> 01:04:02.198]  No, I agree.
[01:04:02.218 --> 01:04:03.400]  That's what the blackjack did.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:03.901]  It needs to be done.
[01:04:04.901 --> 01:04:05.261]  He did.
[01:04:05.661 --> 01:04:07.302]  Go down there and take it to the cartels.
[01:04:07.382 --> 01:04:07.902]  Clean them out.
[01:04:08.223 --> 01:04:11.164]  And by doing that, you're now on Mexican soil.
[01:04:11.184 --> 01:04:12.184]  You're no longer on U.S.
[01:04:12.224 --> 01:04:12.645]  soil.
[01:04:12.885 --> 01:04:16.706]  And by the way, we're not going to send even police in, or military, at point-blank range to get killed by the cartels.
[01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:21.289]  We just use satellites and human intel to mark all their houses and known cartels.
[01:04:21.329 --> 01:04:24.190]  We just send in C-130 gunships and kill them all in three hours.
[01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:28.352]  Couldn't they take out a couple hundred targets across three or four states in just a few hours?
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:34.283]  You have to be mindful of making sure you're not killing innocent people, women and children, who have been kidnapped.
[01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:35.664]  Who were killed by the hundreds of thousands.
[01:04:35.784 --> 01:04:39.786]  Well then, well then, I mean the job of going into each of those houses then will be high casualties.
[01:04:40.066 --> 01:04:41.387]  But I guess just send the Marines in, huh?
[01:04:42.028 --> 01:04:43.649]  Yeah, they could do that quite well.
[01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:44.389]  They're pretty good at it.
[01:04:44.429 --> 01:04:45.950]  I think they've done it a few times in Mexico, right?
[01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:48.472]  Yeah, I was in Montezuma, right?
[01:04:48.752 --> 01:04:49.072]  Yeah.
[01:04:49.492 --> 01:04:51.093]  Alright, hey, great job my friend.
[01:04:51.133 --> 01:04:51.653]  God bless you.
[01:04:51.673 --> 01:04:52.574]  We're going to win in the end.
[01:04:52.814 --> 01:04:55.236]  To learn more, go to StewartRhodesOilKeepers.org.
[01:04:55.516 --> 01:04:56.436]  Check it out and support him.
[01:04:56.456 --> 01:04:56.857]  God bless you.
[01:04:56.877 --> 01:04:57.417]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:05:03.493 --> 01:05:04.634]  Defeat the globalists.
[01:05:05.155 --> 01:05:06.316]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:06.876 --> 01:05:07.937]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[01:05:08.397 --> 01:05:09.498]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:14.683]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:15.324 --> 01:05:18.547]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:19.147 --> 01:05:27.194]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:28.115 --> 01:05:30.536]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[01:05:30.916 --> 01:05:37.498]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:05:38.179 --> 01:05:42.080]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:48.042]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:05:48.102 --> 01:05:50.923]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[01:05:51.123 --> 01:05:52.364]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:52.624 --> 01:05:55.665]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment!
[01:06:04.781 --> 01:06:11.847]  In this briefing room right now there is no government official here, but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:06:23.294 --> 01:06:26.735]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:06:26.775 --> 01:06:28.396]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:06:28.496 --> 01:06:32.217]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[01:06:32.917 --> 01:06:34.157]  They came in peace.
[01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:58.958]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake news.
[01:06:58.998 --> 01:07:05.002]  Maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people.
[01:07:16.528 --> 01:07:17.769]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:19.110]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:20.431]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.461]  This is CNN.
[01:07:33.764 --> 01:07:44.592]  If you're a radio listener, it's not as powerful, but if you're a TV viewer, you saw it.
[01:07:44.772 --> 01:07:54.319]  I have clips yesterday and today of CNN three times, MSNBC, Pelosi, Schumer, all of them saying there's no human smuggling.
[01:07:55.313 --> 01:07:56.474]  Out of Mexico and the U.S.
[01:07:56.594 --> 01:07:57.975]  When the whole thing is human smuggling.
[01:07:58.616 --> 01:07:59.216]  Millions a year.
[01:07:59.877 --> 01:08:00.857]  Tens of thousands of children.
[01:08:02.339 --> 01:08:05.701]  I've got articles saying there's no one trying to take their guns.
[01:08:06.062 --> 01:08:08.383]  And the same publication, they say they're trying to take the guns.
[01:08:11.586 --> 01:08:12.367]  I've got all the U.N.
[01:08:12.387 --> 01:08:14.748]  reports admitting they're organizing all these migrant waves.
[01:08:14.828 --> 01:08:18.611]  And then meanwhile, all over the country.
[01:08:19.912 --> 01:08:21.474]  Particularly on the east and west coast.
[01:08:23.069 --> 01:08:33.553]  They are confiscating firearms with no due process, and not only just sending police on an errand they don't agree with if it's unlawful, but also it's dangerous, real dangerous.
[01:08:33.573 --> 01:08:37.154]  I mean, the last person I went to, some neighbor doesn't like an old veteran who's got guns.
[01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:43.636]  The veteran's done nothing wrong, and then you try to send the cops over there, especially on the wrong day of the week, you know, to take the guy's guns.
[01:08:43.696 --> 01:08:44.716]  It's not going to go well for anybody.
[01:08:45.357 --> 01:08:49.098]  So how about we send the Southern Poverty Law Center and Michael Bloomberg on those missions?
[01:08:49.958 --> 01:08:52.079]  New Washington gun laws spark
[01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:59.969]  Defiance, that's out of the KCBY, the Washington Times, and others are reporting on it.
[01:09:00.109 --> 01:09:02.933]  A lot of sheriffs are saying, we're not going to do this.
[01:09:02.953 --> 01:09:05.937]  This is an unconstitutional, we're not going to take guns from somebody that hasn't done anything wrong.
[01:09:07.347 --> 01:09:18.452]  And we're joined by two great patriots, Sheriff Bob Songer, in these Native American names, I mess them up, Clickett-Tott County, I hope I'm saying that right.
[01:09:19.092 --> 01:09:20.053]  He can correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:09:20.993 --> 01:09:30.357]  And of course, we're joined by Joey Gibson, who needs no introduction, who runs the National Prayer Group, who just goes out and peacefully stands up to Antifa.
[01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:36.140]  Joey Gibson is the founder of the Patriot Prayer Group, and is, of course, gibsonforfreedom.com.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.943]  So you're the expert on this, Joey, along with the sheriff on your particular area.
[01:09:41.963 --> 01:09:43.844]  But remember, this isn't just Washington State.
[01:09:43.884 --> 01:09:44.645]  This is Bloomberg.
[01:09:44.685 --> 01:09:45.365]  This is Soros.
[01:09:45.745 --> 01:09:46.426]  This is their plan.
[01:09:46.466 --> 01:09:49.408]  We can't get national gun bans, which the New York Times said.
[01:09:49.448 --> 01:09:50.448]  Time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:51.749]  Take all semiannuals.
[01:09:51.809 --> 01:09:53.190]  Of course, they'll take everything after that.
[01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:54.611]  This is the target.
[01:09:54.671 --> 01:09:56.752]  So Washington's fight is your fight.
[01:09:56.772 --> 01:09:59.154]  I know the listeners get that, but this is a microcosm.
[01:10:00.506 --> 01:10:00.966]  Thank you.
[01:10:00.986 --> 01:10:02.347]  Yeah, it's really good to be here.
[01:10:02.367 --> 01:10:05.267]  It's really cool that Sheriff Bob Saunders is willing to come on here.
[01:10:05.447 --> 01:10:06.728]  Yeah, it is pronounced click-a-tat.
[01:10:06.788 --> 01:10:10.229]  Some of these counties are very difficult, you know.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:42.527]  Um, it's good to have a sheriff who's willing to come out out in the open and to say, you know, stand up for what he believes in, because there's a lot of sheriffs who believe the same thing that Sheriff Bob believes in, but they're too afraid to speak up.
[01:10:42.627 --> 01:10:43.588]  And so this is what we need.
[01:10:43.608 --> 01:10:50.272]  We need people like Sheriff Bob Songer, who's willing to come out in the open and and he's willing to risk everything for the people, for the Constitution.
[01:10:50.808 --> 01:10:56.360]  I met with him the other day and on numerous occasions he specifically told me that he works for the people.
[01:10:56.941 --> 01:10:57.261]  Okay?
[01:10:57.301 --> 01:10:58.203]  He's not a politician.
[01:10:58.223 --> 01:10:59.326]  He doesn't work for himself.
[01:10:59.386 --> 01:11:02.131]  He's voted in by the people and so he will protect the people.
[01:11:03.308 --> 01:11:12.920]  Well, I don't want to gush here, but sheriffs all over the country, particularly in the West, that have stood up to gun confiscation, stood up to all sorts of evil, these are the real heroes.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:15.944]  That's why you see the Globalist saying, get rid of the American sheriffs.
[01:11:15.964 --> 01:11:18.327]  So, I mean, I should point that out up front.
[01:11:18.728 --> 01:11:20.250]  I know these guys are usually pretty, uh...
[01:11:21.772 --> 01:11:23.433]  Well, you're spot on, by the way, and so is Joy.
[01:11:23.473 --> 01:11:24.313]  The problem I have with I-1639
[01:11:47.688 --> 01:11:48.809]  It violates the U.S.
[01:11:48.869 --> 01:11:52.473]  Constitution and the Washington State Constitution, as far as that goes.
[01:11:53.234 --> 01:12:02.643]  And the problem with that, it's so confusing for the average person, even for law enforcement, who is going to be enforced.
[01:12:03.344 --> 01:12:06.547]  I can tell you that I plan on not enforcing 1639, period.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:26.766]  The concern I have, not only it violates the Second Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, lack of due process, and they're going after the HIPAA law, where they can actually get your medical records, and they don't say who, but somebody determines whether you can even possess a firearm.
[01:12:27.306 --> 01:12:37.909]  Then, in addition to that, if you don't, there's a part in that law, I understand, that if you don't have your weapon secured in a safe or something like that in your home, ammunition in a separate area,
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:57.345]  And you could be in violation if somebody breaks in, steals your guns, breaks a safe open, or if you got them in a closet, or wherever you might have them, takes your gun, goes out, commits a crime, they're going to hold the homeowner, the gun owner, criminally responsible.
[01:12:57.485 --> 01:12:58.766]  And that's a bunch of BS.
[01:12:59.646 --> 01:13:03.247]  That's like if somebody steals your car and kills somebody, you're at fault.
[01:13:04.355 --> 01:13:05.536]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:13:05.556 --> 01:13:14.846]  I mean, there's no common sense to any of this, other than the bottom line, if the far left was honest with everybody, they want all your guns.
[01:13:15.346 --> 01:13:20.912]  But they know that might be impossible, so what they'll do is they'll chip away at that Second Amendment.
[01:13:21.702 --> 01:13:23.003]  And go after your guns.
[01:13:23.664 --> 01:13:31.291]  In fact, our Attorney General in the 2019 legislative session right now is going after all assault weapons.
[01:13:32.291 --> 01:13:41.139]  If it's got a handle, detachable clip, various other features on it, collapsed stock, those kind of things.
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:49.006]  And so if you say, if you have a semi-automatic weapon, it's got a detachable clip, that's an assault weapon as far as they're concerned.
[01:13:50.892 --> 01:13:56.169]  And again, if you just tuned in listeners, this is the formula ten years ago Bloomberg and Soros said they'd do and they've spent...
[01:13:57.364 --> 01:13:59.025]  Over $100 million a year between the two of them.
[01:13:59.065 --> 01:13:59.885]  They also get U.S.
[01:13:59.925 --> 01:14:01.966]  State Department money and bring it back into the U.S.
[01:14:01.986 --> 01:14:02.386]  illegally.
[01:14:02.726 --> 01:14:04.967]  And Lou Dobbs has been talking about that, trying to cut their money off.
[01:14:05.507 --> 01:14:10.388]  So they're running people for local office, and they're using gun control as a way to get their people in.
[01:14:11.089 --> 01:14:15.670]  Once they do that, they run a bunch of other scams and do these scam bond offerings that Soros gets money from.
[01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:22.172]  Basically, it's a mafia coming to your town, taking your gun, trying to take your gun, and scamming you.
[01:14:22.452 --> 01:14:24.473]  I mean, it's just incredible racketeering in my view, Joey.
[01:14:26.431 --> 01:14:27.192]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:27.372 --> 01:14:33.058]  And obviously these people with the billions of dollars are advocating to take away the guns from the normal American people.
[01:14:33.098 --> 01:14:35.801]  They're obviously going to have tons of armed security.
[01:14:36.041 --> 01:14:38.223]  OK, this isn't about gun control.
[01:14:38.264 --> 01:14:40.866]  I mean, this isn't about, you know, guns in itself.
[01:14:40.986 --> 01:14:43.509]  It's really about taking away our freedoms and our rights.
[01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:47.794]  One thing that has been blowing my mind is that look at what's going on in China right now.
[01:14:47.834 --> 01:14:49.055]  There's a huge crackdown.
[01:14:50.039 --> 01:14:50.419]  All right.
[01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:11.591]  Where's that in our country?
[01:15:11.631 --> 01:15:12.271]  That's what we need.
[01:15:12.311 --> 01:15:20.397]  We need people who are willing to stand up regardless of what the consequences are and to stand up for freedom so that our children will be free, our grandchildren.
[01:15:20.637 --> 01:15:21.297]  No, you're right.
[01:15:21.337 --> 01:15:24.099]  Where did the fire of God go in America?
[01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:34.766]  It's still there, but how do we get to the point where we're not willing to stand up for what we believe in when we've got a real chance of winning, when people that have almost no chance of winning do it because they know it's about the decision they make?
[01:15:35.126 --> 01:15:39.529]  Now, I want to talk to Sheriff Bob Songer, who's an amazing patriot out in Washington State.
[01:15:40.677 --> 01:15:45.058]  Who's refusing to take you to jail if somebody breaks into your house and steals your gun?
[01:15:45.819 --> 01:15:46.659]  Of course!
[01:15:46.999 --> 01:15:56.942]  Who's refusing to confiscate your guns because the American Psychological Association magically just says you're mentally ill without a real court ruling it?
[01:15:56.962 --> 01:16:00.223]  By the way, the American Psychological Association just said men, period, are bad.
[01:16:02.729 --> 01:16:07.053]  In the last eight years, we've seen the rise and now fall of the cryptocurrencies.
[01:16:08.034 --> 01:16:13.939]  And the entire time, I refused to take sponsors to fund our operation from the cryptocurrency market.
[01:16:14.419 --> 01:16:23.848]  Not because I thought every company was bad or that the whole thing's a scam, but at a gut level, I knew it was a giant bubble and I didn't want to be associated with that.
[01:16:24.348 --> 01:16:25.569]  Gut level, just couldn't do it.
[01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:28.412]  There have been many other sponsors I've refused.
[01:16:28.972 --> 01:16:45.389]  I have been offered and refused millions of dollars in sponsorship that would have been great to fight the info war from legitimate companies that sell marijuana-derived CBD oil, which has incredible attributes everybody knows about on so many fronts and helps a lot of people.
[01:16:46.092 --> 01:16:54.314]  The reason I haven't gotten involved is the law hasn't been clear and some states, even though it doesn't get you high, see it as illegal.
[01:16:55.074 --> 01:17:14.958]  But now, they have developed and certified for years CBD rich oil derived from hemp that is completely legal in all 50 states and there are so many different permutations and combinations of what it's able to do and what the studies show it's done that it's mind-blowing.
[01:17:15.738 --> 01:17:22.703]  So we've worked with one of the biggest companies in the nation, and they wanted to just work with us openly because they want to stand up for America and freedom.
[01:17:22.743 --> 01:17:23.363]  They're patriots.
[01:17:23.763 --> 01:17:35.071]  But I said, listen, you just need to create your own new website for a private label for us, where you handle it all, where they get the best hemp-derived CBD oil, legal in all 50 states, from you.
[01:17:35.611 --> 01:17:36.452]  You drop ship it.
[01:17:36.552 --> 01:17:37.172]  You get it out.
[01:17:37.373 --> 01:17:38.253]  You have the website.
[01:17:38.874 --> 01:17:39.474]  I promote it.
[01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:40.535]  I send people there.
[01:17:40.815 --> 01:17:43.757]  And that way, they're getting the very best from the experts.
[01:17:43.777 --> 01:17:45.418]  So again, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:17:45.598 --> 01:17:47.939]  Nothing wrong with marijuana-derived CBD oil.
[01:17:48.999 --> 01:17:58.643]  The problem is, some of the public and governments and municipalities get confused, and sometimes people get in trouble with CBD oil if it's too strong.
[01:17:59.404 --> 01:18:04.145]  This isn't CBD oil derived from marijuana that's high in THC.
[01:18:04.426 --> 01:18:09.448]  This is derived from industrial, high-quality, organic hemp.
[01:18:10.168 --> 01:18:12.069]  And it's legal in all 50 states.
[01:18:12.209 --> 01:18:12.509]  And now,
[01:18:13.735 --> 01:18:23.823]  Trump has signed the executive order allowing the industrial growing of hemp, so we won't even have to import it from Canada to Colorado, where it's then produced, bottled, and distributed.
[01:18:24.124 --> 01:18:25.945]  Now listen, I know a lot about it.
[01:18:26.005 --> 01:18:26.566]  I've researched it.
[01:18:26.606 --> 01:18:32.070]  I've turned down probably 20, 30 companies who've been wanting to sponsor us in the last six years.
[01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:33.511]  It's gotten really crazy in the last two.
[01:18:34.312 --> 01:18:46.253]  But now that the law is clear, now that our listeners can't get burned, now that we have a partnership with one of the top companies in the United States known for their organic quality, known for being patriots,
[01:18:47.541 --> 01:18:55.384]  They have created a new website and a private label of their entire spectrum of award-winning products called Washington's Reserve.
[01:18:56.064 --> 01:19:12.290]  And there are so many attributes, so many different things that hemp-derived, hemp-rich CBD oil has to offer that you just need to go to washingtonsreserve.com for yourself and see it all because they have more than 40 products.
[01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:15.411]  Now remember, the Globalists have tried to take our merchant accounts away.
[01:19:15.611 --> 01:19:16.612]  They've tried to shut us down.
[01:19:17.412 --> 01:19:18.613]  They've tried to boycott us.
[01:19:18.633 --> 01:19:19.433]  They've tried to sue us.
[01:19:19.934 --> 01:19:26.417]  And I said in the last six months, I'm going to move, not away from a direct sales marketing of great products to you to fund us.
[01:19:26.637 --> 01:19:34.402]  We're still going to do that for themforwarslife.com, but we're also going to bring on the best sponsors in the country, the very best products.
[01:19:34.502 --> 01:19:36.323]  And this is the first big one.
[01:19:36.703 --> 01:19:37.544]  So I'm very excited.
[01:19:37.584 --> 01:19:38.364]  Be sure and go there.
[01:19:38.424 --> 01:19:45.088]  Experience the power of high quality hemp extract with CBD exclusively available at washingtonsreserve.com for the
[01:19:45.128 --> 01:19:47.589]  Well, highest quality, lowest prices.
[01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:53.793]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, at washingtonsreserve.com, and you're helping fund the info war the whole time.
[01:19:55.954 --> 01:19:58.375]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.689 --> 01:20:22.692]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:23.092 --> 01:20:24.433]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:26.576 --> 01:20:30.080]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.904]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[01:20:41.531 --> 01:20:45.013]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[01:20:45.373 --> 01:20:47.814]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[01:20:47.854 --> 01:20:58.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, Sheriff Bob Songer, who's a great patriot, one of many sheriffs, one of the few that will go on air, saying, I'm not going to enforce these Soros-Bloomberg publicly funded laws.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:10.384]  In places like Washington State, but it's Connecticut, New York, it's happened in California, it's at least 10 states I know of are just running around passing the exact same laws to in due process just take your guns.
[01:21:10.884 --> 01:21:13.045]  Somebody breaks in, gets your guns, it's all your fault.
[01:21:13.085 --> 01:21:15.126]  Breaking your car, it's in the glove box, it's your fault.
[01:21:15.786 --> 01:21:17.087]  That's the craziest thing I've ever heard of.
[01:21:18.287 --> 01:21:20.428]  But it's criminalizing gun ownership is what it is.
[01:21:21.328 --> 01:21:23.209]  It's gonna let these blue cities persecute people.
[01:21:24.531 --> 01:21:26.432]  I hate to even say blue cities, sounds like the cops are bad.
[01:21:26.572 --> 01:21:27.633]  Blue Democrat cities.
[01:21:28.433 --> 01:21:31.535]  Trump says emergency, but oh, but here's the huge announcement after they leave me.
[01:21:32.435 --> 01:21:39.779]  I told you my Pentagon sources and others said Trump's declaring the emergency to circumvent Obama's executive orders, and they thought he was going to do it last night.
[01:21:40.119 --> 01:21:41.019]  Pence signaled that.
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:42.460]  I'm almost never wrong.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:43.220]  I said, okay.
[01:21:45.261 --> 01:21:46.102]  Zero Hedge is right.
[01:21:46.602 --> 01:21:47.583]  He didn't declare it last night.
[01:21:50.884 --> 01:21:51.625]  The video's coming up.
[01:21:51.645 --> 01:21:52.585]  We're downloading it right now.
[01:21:52.605 --> 01:21:53.786]  It's up the hill.
[01:21:55.034 --> 01:21:59.858]  Trump says emergency declaration coming without border deal with the Dems.
[01:22:01.259 --> 01:22:12.147]  President Trump said just now he may declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress and build a border wall if spending talks fail, raising the stakes for negotiations set to resume later in the day.
[01:22:12.988 --> 01:22:16.911]  So he got told not to do it last night in the speech so it would hurt the stock market.
[01:22:16.971 --> 01:22:17.832]  I don't think it would.
[01:22:17.852 --> 01:22:20.013]  I think him taking action and showing he's in charge would help.
[01:22:22.662 --> 01:22:27.779]  Now he's saying, and he goes on to say, but even if that doesn't happen, I'm going to declare one because of the economy.
[01:22:28.746 --> 01:22:35.110]  The president said he has the absolute right to declare an emergency, even though legal scholars and Democrat lawmakers say he does not.
[01:22:35.670 --> 01:22:37.151]  Well, they also say there's no border crisis.
[01:22:37.631 --> 01:22:45.276]  Trump added that the threshold for declaring a national emergency is if he cannot reach a deal with congressional Democrats who have rejected his demand for $5.7 billion.
[01:22:45.856 --> 01:22:49.478]  So the comments come one day after he argued to the nation.
[01:22:49.678 --> 01:22:50.719]  Let's get back to both our guests.
[01:22:50.739 --> 01:22:51.840]  Appreciate you both for this segment.
[01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:56.522]  The next, Sheriff Bob, just recapping what's happening in your area, what you've done.
[01:22:57.763 --> 01:23:00.967]  Well, the Sheriff's Association itself voted against I-1639 originally.
[01:23:15.435 --> 01:23:17.736]  Of course, I can't speak for individual sheriffs.
[01:23:17.756 --> 01:23:20.756]  They have to make up their own mind, obviously.
[01:23:20.776 --> 01:23:27.398]  There's a lot of good sheriffs out there, and I'm sure they feel the way I do, but it's up to them how they approach this.
[01:23:28.358 --> 01:23:33.860]  My feeling on this, we all took an oath to uphold the U.S.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:39.541]  Constitution and the Washington State Constitution, which gives the right to people to bear arms.
[01:23:40.471 --> 01:23:45.353]  And I feel 1639, as I stated before, violates that right.
[01:23:46.454 --> 01:23:48.294]  You know, there's something we don't want to forget.
[01:23:48.935 --> 01:23:51.696]  God, guns, and guts is what made America free.
[01:23:52.436 --> 01:23:56.958]  And we're losing that, basically.
[01:23:57.698 --> 01:24:06.682]  They chip away at that Second Amendment and make it so difficult for an honest citizen to possess a firearm to protect his family and himself that
[01:24:07.662 --> 01:24:14.303]  Pretty soon, what they hope is citizens will just give up the fight and not arm themselves.
[01:24:14.323 --> 01:24:18.484]  And I, for one, I've told citizens, they've called in and asked my position on it.
[01:24:19.124 --> 01:24:25.466]  I said, if they come to take your guns, I'll be standing beside you and I'll call in a bunch of people and deputize them.
[01:24:26.366 --> 01:24:30.587]  They are not going to take your guns without due process.
[01:24:32.708 --> 01:24:35.110]  I tell you, everywhere else they've taken the guns.
[01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:36.911]  Mexico has total gun control.
[01:24:36.931 --> 01:24:38.313]  They have the highest crime rate in the world.
[01:24:38.873 --> 01:24:41.895]  Can't the left and the globalists just leave us alone?
[01:24:42.015 --> 01:24:42.216]  No.
[01:24:43.056 --> 01:24:46.139]  They want the prosperity and the money and the power that all this freedom brought.
[01:24:46.679 --> 01:24:52.564]  And then why would they want to extinct the thing that gave them a country to come to to have so much success, Sheriff?
[01:24:54.076 --> 01:25:00.483]  Well, you know, I think the open border issue, I think that they're hoping that'll increase their voting base.
[01:25:01.284 --> 01:25:03.787]  There's a number of reasons I think they do what they do.
[01:25:05.109 --> 01:25:12.557]  Unfortunately, you know, it's going to be on the back of good citizens that we're paying the price.
[01:25:13.181 --> 01:25:29.609]  And you know, I was told by somebody, I don't know how true it is, but there's an individual some years ago, I think it was over in Poland or one of the foreign countries over there, where to make a safer community, they confiscated all weapons.
[01:25:30.843 --> 01:25:39.369]  And then he was able to load thousands of people on boxcars, had no way to resist, and his name was Adolf Hitler.
[01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:43.492]  And of course we know about the Warsaw Ghetto, we know that did indeed happen.
[01:25:44.895 --> 01:25:45.875]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:46.336 --> 01:25:51.277]  And history can repeat itself and they're headed towards socialism and all this nonsense.
[01:25:51.337 --> 01:25:55.519]  Hell, we got Antifa not letting people have Christian marches all over the country.
[01:25:55.759 --> 01:26:05.262]  My reporters tried to go cover an event and Antifa had semi-autos and threatened to basically kill my reporters and the police did nothing in Austin because they're blue city police.
[01:26:05.862 --> 01:26:07.943]  And I mean, people see that.
[01:26:07.983 --> 01:26:09.744]  It's like this is happening to us.
[01:26:10.484 --> 01:26:14.947]  And the left says, once we get your guns, we're going to kill you conservatives and you Christians.
[01:26:15.007 --> 01:26:16.008]  And they've done it everywhere.
[01:26:16.048 --> 01:26:17.609]  They mean business.
[01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:20.792]  Joey, I tell you, I wish we had sheriffs like this guy everywhere.
[01:26:22.518 --> 01:26:24.801]  Yeah, and the truth is, we do have them out there.
[01:26:24.841 --> 01:26:29.267]  They're just more concerned about the consequences, like I was saying earlier.
[01:26:29.287 --> 01:26:35.495]  I think, you know, Sheriff Bob Songer is a really big deal for us right now because he's a voice for the rest of the sheriffs.
[01:26:35.535 --> 01:26:40.662]  He's there to say what all the sheriffs are thinking, but maybe they're too afraid to say.
[01:26:41.222 --> 01:26:44.667]  And so I think that, you know, we all need to be thanking Sheriff Bob Songer.
[01:26:44.827 --> 01:26:49.733]  If you, if you're on Klick Attack County, you guys definitely elected the right sheriff.
[01:26:49.753 --> 01:26:52.596]  Like, this is the type of sheriff I wish I had in Clark County.
[01:26:52.956 --> 01:26:54.038]  My sheriff from Clark County.
[01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:57.696]  Without hesitation said, yep, on 4-16-39.
[01:26:57.876 --> 01:27:02.937]  Never even questioned it, never even really talked about some of the things that are unconstitutional.
[01:27:03.338 --> 01:27:08.559]  It's unbelievable that they're literally going to have people in back rooms going through your medical records, right?
[01:27:08.919 --> 01:27:11.020]  And just decide who's eligible and who isn't.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.161]  Again, no judge, no jury.
[01:27:13.521 --> 01:27:14.821]  It's a new super class.
[01:27:14.882 --> 01:27:16.742]  These psychologists are almost all leftist.
[01:27:17.122 --> 01:27:25.046]  I mean, the American Psychological Association just announced, Fox has covered it, and said men in traditional roles, period, is a mental illness.
[01:27:25.846 --> 01:27:30.328]  I mean, these people, this is a cult of lunatics!
[01:27:32.048 --> 01:27:32.868]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:33.228 --> 01:27:38.830]  And I do really like another thing, too, that Sheriff Bob Songer did, because this is the thing, they don't want men to be men, right?
[01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:45.911]  But Sheriff Bob Songer, he got 130 citizens, you know, not paid, volunteer, doesn't cost any taxpayer money.
[01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:52.013]  So he has 130 armed citizens ready to act at any moment, especially in a county, a rural county working for the government.
[01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:54.973]  So he's really reenacting the original posse.
[01:27:55.013 --> 01:27:57.434]  He's enacting the real power of the sheriff.
[01:27:59.622 --> 01:28:00.122]  Absolutely.
[01:28:00.322 --> 01:28:02.384]  So, Sheriff Bob Songer, you should tell them about that.
[01:28:02.404 --> 01:28:03.244]  Yeah, tell us about it.
[01:28:03.304 --> 01:28:06.526]  I mean, you're bringing back local civil defense into the Constitution.
[01:28:06.546 --> 01:28:07.086]  That's awesome.
[01:28:08.227 --> 01:28:15.111]  Well, what we have is, let me say first, though, I'm not speaking for the Sheriff's Association.
[01:28:15.551 --> 01:28:16.371]  Oh, I know you weren't.
[01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:17.992]  When I asked, we got to go to break.
[01:28:18.012 --> 01:28:18.512]  We're short on time.
[01:28:18.532 --> 01:28:19.613]  But come back and tell us about that, too.
[01:28:19.933 --> 01:28:21.314]  We're not saying you speak for the sheriffs.
[01:28:21.594 --> 01:28:24.716]  We were asking what other sheriffs privately are telling you the sense of things.
[01:28:25.816 --> 01:28:26.617]  Right, right.
[01:28:26.797 --> 01:28:28.138]  And that's what they're telling me.
[01:28:29.249 --> 01:28:30.491]  Sure, yeah, we know you're not speaking for him.
[01:28:30.711 --> 01:28:31.432]  We've got to go to break.
[01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:35.037]  Joey, tell folks, you've got a lot of places to find you.
[01:28:35.617 --> 01:28:36.358]  Where's the best place?
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.565]  Gibsonforfreedom.com is the best place because it's not being censored.
[01:28:41.925 --> 01:28:43.788]  Otherwise, go to Patreon or Facebook.
[01:28:44.429 --> 01:28:48.231]  But if you go to gibsonforfreedom.com, you can donate and you can sign up on the email list.
[01:28:48.251 --> 01:28:51.793]  The email list is the best way to guarantee that they'll be able to keep updated on all events.
[01:28:51.813 --> 01:28:56.756]  All right, we're going to come back and get the sheriff to break down a lot of key points on the other side.
[01:28:56.776 --> 01:28:59.998]  We're very honored to have both of you, as other listeners are very honored as well.
[01:29:00.018 --> 01:29:02.880]  Stay with us.
[01:29:07.362 --> 01:29:13.026]  Conservatively, there have been several thousand articles written in the last three years
[01:29:14.235 --> 01:29:19.357]  Demonizing Info Wars, and yours truly, for selling high-quality supplements.
[01:29:20.518 --> 01:29:39.006]  In fact, even the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, that owns the biggest sellers of supplements in the world, even that organization has written hit pieces claiming, I'm a fraud in selling snake oil, when they're owned by a man who owns Amazon and Whole Foods.
[01:29:40.695 --> 01:29:42.696]  Amazon was the number one supplement seller in the world.
[01:29:43.076 --> 01:29:43.917]  Whole Foods was number two.
[01:29:44.797 --> 01:29:50.160]  He owns the number one and number two biggest supplement sellers on the planet.
[01:29:51.681 --> 01:29:57.905]  And then his publication, a weaponized disinformation op, says I'm bad and should be shut down.
[01:29:59.226 --> 01:30:12.913]  When more than 15 of the 70 products we have at InfoWarsLife.com are private labeled, highest quality, top of the line, that are sold at Whole Foods for higher prices.
[01:30:13.814 --> 01:30:16.055]  Think about the level of that fraud.
[01:30:16.816 --> 01:30:19.717]  And I've sent messages to these news organizations pointing that out.
[01:30:19.877 --> 01:30:20.498]  No response.
[01:30:20.718 --> 01:30:22.178]  They never want to get my comment.
[01:30:22.239 --> 01:30:23.139]  Now, why am I saying that?
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:24.800]  It's simple.
[01:30:25.831 --> 01:30:30.395]  We have a lot of proprietary original products, but a lot of them are also private labeled.
[01:30:30.796 --> 01:30:36.081]  Whatever already has five stars, whatever people already love, whatever's been tested to be the best.
[01:30:36.742 --> 01:30:37.963]  So we have a great product.
[01:30:38.083 --> 01:30:38.503]  You love it.
[01:30:38.563 --> 01:30:39.184]  You reorder it.
[01:30:39.564 --> 01:30:41.827]  The Globals are going to test our products, trying to find something.
[01:30:42.307 --> 01:30:44.209]  So we're going to be able to, you know, defeat all that.
[01:30:44.369 --> 01:30:45.430]  It's a 360 win.
[01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:46.451]  We defeat them.
[01:30:46.531 --> 01:30:46.912]  You win.
[01:30:47.052 --> 01:30:47.372]  I win.
[01:30:47.692 --> 01:30:48.173]  It's amazing.
[01:30:50.026 --> 01:30:54.831]  And you've seen them come after our attempts to even process credit cards and shut down InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:30:54.871 --> 01:31:10.468]  I mean, it's incredible not just what frauds they are and how they're anti-free market and how they're racketeering against us, not just Jeff Bezos, but this entire system of mainstream media and mainstream corporations and banking are even worse than Bezos and Amazon.
[01:31:12.392 --> 01:31:12.892]  It's hard to believe.
[01:31:12.972 --> 01:31:15.713]  I'm just illustrating how crazy this all is.
[01:31:15.793 --> 01:31:23.275]  Now, I'm going to be cutting some informational pieces in the next few weeks that go into great depth on each one of the products.
[01:31:24.115 --> 01:31:26.376]  I've done this for some of the products, but I haven't done it in a while.
[01:31:26.396 --> 01:31:35.899]  I haven't done it for the new products because, quite frankly, it's like going to school for a college exam to try to accurately talk about how great these products are.
[01:31:35.999 --> 01:31:36.699]  But just know this.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:46.843]  Whatever the attributes that Jeff Bezos and Amazon and Whole Foods are allowed to tell you about their flagship products, these are as good or better.
[01:31:47.163 --> 01:31:49.404]  These are all the top of the line, very best.
[01:31:50.124 --> 01:32:00.428]  I can't even tell you what they do and the history of it and how amazing they are because they selectively enforce and will send the FDA after us.
[01:32:01.269 --> 01:32:02.349]  You see, I'm a subhuman.
[01:32:02.469 --> 01:32:03.129]  I'm garbage.
[01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:05.790]  So Bezos can make all the claims.
[01:32:05.970 --> 01:32:07.271]  Whole Foods can make all the claims.
[01:32:08.467 --> 01:32:09.870]  Because this stuff is dynamite.
[01:32:10.452 --> 01:32:11.614]  Turmeric's dynamite.
[01:32:12.336 --> 01:32:14.000]  Iodine that's clean is dynamite.
[01:32:15.142 --> 01:32:16.826]  Super Mel Vitality, they have similar products.
[01:32:16.886 --> 01:32:17.588]  It's all dynamite.
[01:32:19.161 --> 01:32:21.883]  They can tell you how great it is and show you all the facts and tell you.
[01:32:22.083 --> 01:32:23.023]  Because they're the elite.
[01:32:23.364 --> 01:32:24.064]  I'm just scum.
[01:32:24.704 --> 01:32:25.605]  Just like you, according to them.
[01:32:25.665 --> 01:32:28.086]  But the good news is, you've seen how great these products work.
[01:32:28.447 --> 01:32:32.609]  We do break down some of the basics on each page at mforwarslife.com to see how wonderful they are.
[01:32:33.109 --> 01:32:38.193]  But experience turmeric, experience X3, experience super male vitality, super female vitality.
[01:32:38.373 --> 01:32:42.395]  That, by the way, is the last run of our best-selling product, super male vitality, super female.
[01:32:42.415 --> 01:32:46.938]  Because we can't even get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, so we can't get the supply.
[01:32:46.958 --> 01:32:48.499]  And I'm sick of it, so I'm discontinuing it.
[01:32:49.019 --> 01:32:49.960]  Because it's so frustrating.
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:53.182]  This is the last run, and it's all 50% off.
[01:32:53.322 --> 01:32:58.205]  Bodies, X3, and Supermail at mfullwarsstore.com and mfullwarslife.com.
[01:32:58.385 --> 01:32:59.265]  Thanks for your support.
[01:33:05.949 --> 01:33:08.611]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:30.239 --> 01:33:36.481]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.381 --> 01:33:39.161]  You can't ban the iron rods.
[01:33:39.401 --> 01:33:42.062]  The guns, the iron rods, Pierce, didn't do it.
[01:33:42.282 --> 01:33:43.322]  The tyrants did it.
[01:33:43.342 --> 01:33:44.302]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:33:44.582 --> 01:33:45.603]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:33:45.903 --> 01:33:46.763]  Mao took the guns.
[01:33:46.963 --> 01:33:48.283]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:33:48.424 --> 01:33:49.664]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:33:49.844 --> 01:33:55.126]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[01:33:55.306 --> 01:33:59.587]  Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[01:33:59.827 --> 01:34:01.128]  We will not relinquish them.
[01:34:01.328 --> 01:34:02.288]  Do you understand?
[01:34:02.628 --> 01:34:09.751]  That's why you're going to fail and the establishment knows, no matter how much propaganda, the Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:34:12.705 --> 01:34:18.449]  And they had just had a piece before I came on about, in India, mass raping women with iron rods.
[01:34:20.851 --> 01:34:29.357]  And I said, Piers, you just came out of break with the last news package about this practice of, I guess, they almost sterilize women with a rod.
[01:34:29.417 --> 01:34:30.137]  It's horrible.
[01:34:30.217 --> 01:34:30.537]  God.
[01:34:31.498 --> 01:34:32.719]  Those guys need to be executed.
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:36.862]  And it's not the iron rods' fault.
[01:34:37.162 --> 01:34:38.003]  It's not the gun's fault.
[01:34:38.023 --> 01:34:40.785]  It's not the car's fault when Islamists just runs over people.
[01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:49.756]  Sheriff Bob Songer was out in Kennecott County and Seattle and all those other big cities.
[01:34:49.796 --> 01:34:51.057]  They want the guns confiscated.
[01:34:51.077 --> 01:34:54.380]  Just if some backroom get into this, Sheriff, because it's in the law.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.682]  I remember reading this myself before they passed it.
[01:34:57.302 --> 01:35:03.907]  And then, you know, of course, Joey jumping here, who's been helping expose all this, Joey Gibson, the National Prayer Group.
[01:35:04.848 --> 01:35:07.730]  Well, I appreciate the opportunity Alex and Joey for getting a chance to be on and address 1639.
[01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:09.671]  Let me first touch on the Posse.
[01:35:09.711 --> 01:35:11.593]  It's a citizen organization, volunteer.
[01:35:35.081 --> 01:35:38.124]  And of course, we do backgrounds on folks to join the posse.
[01:35:38.425 --> 01:35:44.811]  Because I am a big Second Amendment guy, and they're allowed to carry a firearm when they're in uniform.
[01:35:45.772 --> 01:35:55.402]  Well, they can carry it off-duty anytime they want, but while they're in uniform, they can carry a firearm after they've qualified through the NRA qualification course.
[01:35:56.542 --> 01:36:05.786]  And let me guess, I mean, I was reading that it's been a success since you did it, and it saves the county a lot of money.
[01:36:23.650 --> 01:36:24.210]  Absolutely.
[01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:29.871]  And by the way, we have six private pilots that fly for us at no cost.
[01:36:30.332 --> 01:36:31.252]  Not even for fuel.
[01:36:31.372 --> 01:36:33.232]  They donate all of that.
[01:36:33.292 --> 01:36:35.773]  They fly, of course, during fire season.
[01:36:35.793 --> 01:36:36.993]  They look for fires.
[01:36:37.353 --> 01:36:38.433]  If we have a suspect, we're looking for him.
[01:36:38.453 --> 01:36:40.754]  But that's the way it's always been in any free society.
[01:36:40.794 --> 01:36:43.314]  The men and women, men particularly, have that duty.
[01:36:43.514 --> 01:36:44.755]  They have their regular job.
[01:36:45.015 --> 01:36:50.236]  But then when there's an emergency, they work with the local stabulary, and that's the power of the society.
[01:36:51.262 --> 01:36:51.842]  Absolutely.
[01:36:52.423 --> 01:36:59.726]  They're a partner with our law enforcement agency to make a safer community, and I'm extremely proud of those individuals.
[01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:16.775]  And we have reserve deputies and search and rescue volunteers as well, but the posse itself, over about a 10-11 month period, the hours that they put in, calculated out at a minimum wage, is around $269,000, they say, at the county.
[01:37:20.603 --> 01:37:27.148]  But it's about getting everybody involved, and it's just the American way, it's the Western way, it's the way that works.
[01:37:27.589 --> 01:37:31.212]  Getting back to this gun confiscation, what do you expect to happen?
[01:37:31.252 --> 01:37:41.781]  We've already seen other areas of the country where somebody in a secret liberal back room says, this guy has PTSD, he doesn't have a criminal record, he didn't threaten anybody, but let's just take his guns.
[01:37:43.138 --> 01:37:44.040]  It won't happen.
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:46.224]  It will not happen on my watch.
[01:37:46.725 --> 01:37:51.894]  I will stand there with that individual citizen and prevent that from happening.
[01:37:51.914 --> 01:37:54.940]  And if need be, it could get ugly.
[01:37:57.014 --> 01:38:24.200]  I mean, we really are, we don't want violence, but we're not starting anything, Sheriff and Joey, but we kind of have that Bunker Hill moment coming when you've got the left and cities they control and the police help anti-attack people, they stand down, they're anti-free speech, and now they're coming for our guns, and now they've got the pedophile groups in the schools sexualizing the children, and at a certain point, I'm afraid that Bunker Hill moment where they come for the guns is going to have that shot heard around the world, Joey.
[01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.122]  Unfortunately, yeah, that's true.
[01:38:28.942 --> 01:38:30.504]  It's something we definitely want to avoid.
[01:38:30.544 --> 01:38:32.365]  And I know you talked about that all the time, Alex.
[01:38:32.385 --> 01:38:34.747]  You say a civil war is not going to work to our advantage.
[01:38:34.767 --> 01:38:38.750]  You know, we're talking about a lot of people dying and it's probably going to give more power to the government.
[01:38:39.291 --> 01:38:41.433]  But unfortunately, it's like, how much can you push?
[01:38:41.453 --> 01:38:44.315]  You know, how much can you push and poke before people come back?
[01:38:44.715 --> 01:38:51.441]  And the interesting thing to me is you have different situations where they've tried to go in and take guns and they see how the public reacts.
[01:38:51.917 --> 01:39:02.901]  One example, in Seattle, I believe last year, they went in, the police broke down a guy's door, took all his guns because the guy's neighbors felt uncomfortable because he was open carrying all the time.
[01:39:03.274 --> 01:39:06.636]  Which, in Seattle, you can open carry anywhere except for a private property.
[01:39:06.736 --> 01:39:22.385]  Oh, I've seen articles where a guy, you know, the city grows out to his area, was a case in Texas, and the guy's skinning a deer in the countryside, and the neighbors call the police, and they take him to jail, calling ten guns an arsenal, because it upset the Californians that the guy was gutting a deer.
[01:39:22.505 --> 01:39:23.386]  These people are crazy!
[01:39:24.565 --> 01:39:25.246]  Absolutely true.
[01:39:25.646 --> 01:39:26.747]  Now, think about this.
[01:39:26.867 --> 01:39:27.307]  I remember that.
[01:39:27.367 --> 01:39:28.548]  Now, here's what's really interesting.
[01:39:28.628 --> 01:39:31.770]  I talked about this last time I was on your show in Bonner County in Idaho.
[01:39:32.150 --> 01:39:35.413]  Okay, you remember when the VA was going around taking all the guns from the veterans.
[01:39:35.813 --> 01:39:36.413]  Now, what happened?
[01:39:36.433 --> 01:39:39.936]  The sheriff stood in front of the guy's house, right?
[01:39:40.296 --> 01:39:45.720]  With over 100 citizens and even Matt Shea, who's from Washington State, all right?
[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:46.861]  A state representative.
[01:39:47.321 --> 01:39:53.145]  They stood out there and said, you're not going to come in and violate the Constitution and take this man's firearms.
[01:39:53.649 --> 01:39:56.310]  And look at the difference in the response between that and Seattle.
[01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:58.070]  Now they know they can't go in that county.
[01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:59.751]  They know that county will stand up.
[01:40:00.151 --> 01:40:01.211]  What happened in Seattle?
[01:40:01.571 --> 01:40:01.911]  Nothing.
[01:40:02.091 --> 01:40:03.072]  No outrage, nothing.
[01:40:03.232 --> 01:40:04.292]  So they know that they can get away with it.
[01:40:04.312 --> 01:40:04.672]  But let's be clear.
[01:40:04.692 --> 01:40:08.793]  People like Sheriff Songer and the other sheriff, people have to support them, pray for them.
[01:40:08.813 --> 01:40:10.354]  He's going to get the demon eyes coming on here.
[01:40:10.394 --> 01:40:11.134]  They'll make a bunch of lies.
[01:40:12.034 --> 01:40:26.003]  Soros and Bloomberg are openly financing trying to stop, in fact, Sheriff Songer, I haven't followed your particular case, but I'm sure you're aware of the millions that those guys are spending in Washington State alone to try to defeat folks like you.
[01:40:26.023 --> 01:40:30.626]  So you've got even more courage sticking your head up because obviously they're going to target you now in your re-election.
[01:40:32.267 --> 01:40:37.451]  Yeah, well, I just went through a re-election and got re-elected.
[01:40:37.811 --> 01:40:38.952]  So folks like what you're doing.
[01:40:41.375 --> 01:40:46.738]  Yes, and I am awful proud and humbled that I get to serve another four years for the citizens.
[01:40:47.378 --> 01:40:48.759]  And really, that's what it's about.
[01:40:49.179 --> 01:40:55.022]  You know, elected sheriffs, their only boss, their only boss is the citizens.
[01:40:55.722 --> 01:41:00.264]  And it's not some board or council or anything like this.
[01:41:00.802 --> 01:41:04.263]  And I can tell you, I've served four years as a police chief in Elko, Nevada.
[01:41:04.923 --> 01:41:07.904]  And I can tell you that police chiefs feel just like I do.
[01:41:08.444 --> 01:41:13.105]  But unfortunately, they don't have the ability that a sheriff has because the sheriff's elected.
[01:41:13.966 --> 01:41:23.048]  If they speak out and their boss, council, or mayor happens to be liberal, then they'd better be looking for a new job.
[01:41:23.068 --> 01:41:28.630]  Sure, so municipalities are muzzled and that's why the office of the president going back 800 years is so sacrosanct.
[01:41:29.770 --> 01:41:29.890]  Yep.
[01:41:30.984 --> 01:41:37.594]  What do you think, Sheriff, of the attempts by the globalists on the left to remove and munialize the sheriff and merge it under cities?
[01:41:37.634 --> 01:41:38.455]  Let's ask backwards.
[01:41:40.017 --> 01:41:41.620]  Yeah, well, that's what they'd like to do.
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:46.347]  And you see some of these home rural counties
[01:41:46.969 --> 01:41:49.391]  Where the sheriff's position is actually appointed.
[01:41:49.491 --> 01:41:52.874]  Well, you're getting right back to a police chief situation.
[01:41:54.015 --> 01:42:01.000]  They need to keep those sheriffs elected positions because the people then have say so.
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:01.581]  Well, sure.
[01:42:01.601 --> 01:42:06.584]  It's another check and balance of the jury, the grand jury, the people elect their law enforcement.
[01:42:06.685 --> 01:42:07.005]  Wow.
[01:42:07.105 --> 01:42:10.267]  What a what a what a British and Americana idea.
[01:42:10.808 --> 01:42:12.489]  Gentlemen, I want to salute you both.
[01:42:12.609 --> 01:42:13.390]  I want to thank you.
[01:42:15.471 --> 01:42:16.612]  Joey, the great work you're doing.
[01:42:17.032 --> 01:42:21.153]  Sheriff Bob Songer, please come back on to advise us on what's unfolding in your area.
[01:42:21.173 --> 01:42:25.635]  You're the front line of the defensive, not just your constituents, but also the country.
[01:42:26.255 --> 01:42:30.936]  Is there any way for people to contact you, Bob, if they want to try to support you or interview you?
[01:42:30.996 --> 01:42:35.098]  Or just, I guess, go to the website for the county there in Washington?
[01:42:36.363 --> 01:42:41.286]  They can do that, or they can reach me on my cell phone.
[01:42:41.566 --> 01:42:42.847]  It's 509-261-1833.
[01:42:43.748 --> 01:42:44.128]  Okay.
[01:42:44.568 --> 01:42:47.970]  You're about to get 5,000 calls, but some of them will be mean.
[01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:49.291]  This guy's John Wayne for real.
[01:42:49.691 --> 01:42:50.852]  All right, gentlemen, we love you.
[01:42:51.212 --> 01:42:53.854]  We appreciate you, and I'll meet you right there at the Alamo.
[01:42:53.874 --> 01:42:54.394]  God bless.
[01:42:55.515 --> 01:42:55.875]  Thank you.
[01:42:55.915 --> 01:42:56.235]  Thank you.
[01:42:57.596 --> 01:42:58.977]  Good to know there's still some Americans left.
[01:42:58.997 --> 01:43:00.238]  We'll be right back with the breaking news.
[01:43:05.183 --> 01:43:12.028]  Google's world headquarters, they've now officially moved to China, is on fire right now, if you're a radio listener.
[01:43:12.288 --> 01:43:18.453]  And so we've got the headline here of the Daily Mail, gigantic fire erupts from the roof of Google office in China's Silicon Valley.
[01:43:18.573 --> 01:43:24.618]  A massive fire erupted in a Google office in China, sending dangerous black plumes of smoke rising in the air.
[01:43:24.658 --> 01:43:26.679]  The furious blaze was first reported at 11 a.m.
[01:43:26.719 --> 01:43:32.684]  local time on Wednesday in Zhonggangkan Tech District, also known as China's Silicon Valley in Beijing.
[01:43:32.924 --> 01:43:35.767]  Google is an AI super weapon.
[01:43:35.847 --> 01:43:38.410]  It is a system that gets the whole world to opt into it.
[01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:40.652]  So they can then game stock markets, economies.
[01:43:40.932 --> 01:43:44.896]  It can then predict what you're going to do with almost total certainty before you do it.
[01:43:44.916 --> 01:43:47.879]  And there's a race between Facebook and Amazon.
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:58.403]  And Apple with Google, even though they're all very incestuous and work in and out of each other, to build the first global AI system that they believe will then take over all the markets and take over society.
[01:43:58.443 --> 01:43:59.664]  It's basically already happened.
[01:43:59.884 --> 01:44:02.304]  Google is the top of the pyramid, right there with Apple.
[01:44:02.565 --> 01:44:04.465]  All things are Google, aren't they?
[01:44:04.605 --> 01:44:15.969]  The global DARPA-controlled and DARPA-designed advanced research project into a human-mass-machine interface to be able to predict the future and then control the future.
[01:44:16.469 --> 01:44:33.314]  That's in the founding documents of Google 1997-1998 and it was in Wired Magazine four years ago they actually released the quote classified Google documents admitting that when they were getting CIA funding and NSA funding they're saying we already have search engines.
[01:44:33.374 --> 01:44:34.314]  This is NSA technology.
[01:44:34.354 --> 01:44:34.734]  They said no.
[01:44:34.754 --> 01:44:42.576]  We're going to get humans to interface with it with their hopes, their dreams, all their actions, dial it into all the other machines and computers and have a lifetime model of the world
[01:44:42.916 --> 01:44:45.097]  We're already deep into the AI war of the 21st century.
[01:44:45.317 --> 01:44:47.719]  These things are already artificially intelligent.
[01:44:47.739 --> 01:44:52.442]  The question is, when will they become, if not already, conscious, self-aware, sentient?
[01:44:52.482 --> 01:44:53.782]  So let me tell you what's coming next.
[01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:07.791]  Google has 90 plus percent of all the searches.
[01:45:08.051 --> 01:45:10.272]  They've got over half the advertising on the planet now.
[01:45:10.452 --> 01:45:14.335]  They are getting into every faction and system of supply chain.
[01:45:14.435 --> 01:45:20.799]  They have bragged in internal memos that they can deliver elections to whoever the political structure wants them to.
[01:45:21.099 --> 01:45:22.720]  Why wouldn't you steal their passcode?
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:24.081]  Why wouldn't you move to Communist China?
[01:45:24.301 --> 01:45:29.825]  Why wouldn't you help build a censorship system for the Communist Party they've been using for years that's about to go nationwide?
[01:45:30.305 --> 01:45:33.087]  And why not tell Congress, I don't know anything about Dragonfly.
[01:45:33.127 --> 01:45:34.348]  We have lots of projects.
[01:45:34.408 --> 01:45:35.949]  We don't intend to go live with that.
[01:45:35.989 --> 01:45:37.690]  Meanwhile, their internal emails have been released.
[01:45:37.710 --> 01:45:40.032]  They're like, find out whoever did this in FM.
[01:45:40.132 --> 01:45:41.793]  This is our most secret project.
[01:45:42.054 --> 01:45:44.916]  Listed top secret beta testing for the rest of the world.
[01:45:45.136 --> 01:45:48.418]  We're competing with Apple for the global social ID.
[01:45:49.139 --> 01:45:51.921]  And Google is not going to let Apple get the global social ID.
[01:45:52.181 --> 01:45:53.822]  We are going to rule the planet!
[01:45:54.723 --> 01:45:57.085]  Our AI system is superior!
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:04.222]  Look at that.
[01:46:04.282 --> 01:46:06.265]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[01:46:06.285 --> 01:46:07.687]  That's because it's been denatured.
[01:46:07.707 --> 01:46:08.529]  It's been watered down.
[01:46:08.549 --> 01:46:09.671]  We didn't do that.
[01:46:11.324 --> 01:46:15.447]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[01:46:15.868 --> 01:46:17.509]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[01:46:18.089 --> 01:46:26.636]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[01:46:27.116 --> 01:46:28.797]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[01:46:28.837 --> 01:46:29.938]  Don't you get the big secret?
[01:46:30.659 --> 01:46:33.181]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[01:46:33.201 --> 01:46:34.301]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[01:46:35.062 --> 01:46:37.844]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[01:46:47.006 --> 01:46:53.031]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[01:46:53.071 --> 01:46:57.894]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[01:46:58.394 --> 01:47:01.577]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in 4store.com.
[01:47:06.941 --> 01:47:09.543]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:20.793]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:47:43.670 --> 01:47:43.890]  3 p.m.
[01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:44.190]  I'm here.
[01:47:44.210 --> 01:47:45.691]  You got the David Knight Show in the morning.
[01:47:45.731 --> 01:47:47.691]  He'll be back three weeks or so.
[01:47:47.711 --> 01:47:48.371]  He had a heart attack.
[01:47:48.412 --> 01:47:48.972]  He's getting better.
[01:47:48.992 --> 01:47:53.293]  We got a great host filling in there and doing a great job in the morning.
[01:47:53.833 --> 01:47:57.534]  A selection of people like Harrison Smith.
[01:47:58.234 --> 01:47:59.335]  Paul Watson's gonna be on tomorrow.
[01:48:01.695 --> 01:48:03.216]  That's Friday he's gonna be co-hosting.
[01:48:03.236 --> 01:48:04.136]  He's on this show tomorrow.
[01:48:05.817 --> 01:48:06.097]  All right.
[01:48:07.782 --> 01:48:15.604]  I feel like I should open the phones up for callers to talk about Trump's speech last night and the fact that he said, I may declare a national emergency.
[01:48:16.085 --> 01:48:17.765]  I'm going to declare a national emergency.
[01:48:18.545 --> 01:48:19.806]  The word was he was going to do it.
[01:48:19.866 --> 01:48:22.086]  Now there's reports where he's back out saying it.
[01:48:24.707 --> 01:48:26.848]  So I don't know what's going on behind the scenes, but, uh,
[01:48:28.735 --> 01:48:38.203]  That's in the Constitution, and it's also a fact that Obama put in executive orders that I think are unconstitutional that can only be overridden by a new emergency.
[01:48:39.144 --> 01:48:46.630]  And that's how Obama created a government within a government of his operatives staying behind in the system to block the president.
[01:48:47.851 --> 01:48:51.313]  So, you know, the most disquieting thing is that
[01:48:56.513 --> 01:48:58.835]  Trump says, get the troops out of Syria.
[01:48:59.775 --> 01:49:04.378]  Cut them in half in Afghanistan, and we just hear, well, that's not happening.
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:08.341]  All these people are resigning.
[01:49:09.402 --> 01:49:14.886]  How dare you destabilize things when it's Obama started the Syria war, funded the Arab Spring.
[01:49:14.946 --> 01:49:15.846]  It's just like, what?
[01:49:16.807 --> 01:49:23.872]  He was the one that let ISIS come in, and Al-Qaeda, and the Muslim Brotherhood, and all of that, and the big columns of trucks driving in.
[01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:26.451]  And the media just ignored it.
[01:49:28.732 --> 01:49:33.916]  And then now it's Trump's fault that we had to deal with Syria once they were defeated to pull out.
[01:49:35.637 --> 01:49:43.762]  And then I see Trump being countermanded by all this, and it's because the bureaucracy is at war with this country.
[01:49:46.023 --> 01:49:48.305]  You know, there's a name for that biologically.
[01:49:48.925 --> 01:49:49.826]  It's called cancer.
[01:49:52.844 --> 01:49:53.084]  That's right.
[01:49:53.104 --> 01:49:58.146]  It's called cancer when your own tissues start doing what they want.
[01:49:58.166 --> 01:50:02.808]  Could be your liver, could be your skin, could be your lungs, could be your blood.
[01:50:03.388 --> 01:50:05.889]  And it just goes haywire and starts doing whatever it wants.
[01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:11.772]  And I look at the talking points put out by the Democrats on every issue.
[01:50:12.812 --> 01:50:14.453]  I've got three or four clips the last day.
[01:50:14.813 --> 01:50:17.114]  There is no human smuggling on the border.
[01:50:17.134 --> 01:50:18.194]  There is no crisis.
[01:50:18.914 --> 01:50:20.115]  I've got like ten clips of that.
[01:50:20.755 --> 01:50:21.435]  You've all heard it.
[01:50:21.475 --> 01:50:22.236]  No reason to play it.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:23.800]  It's everywhere!
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:29.885]  And then I saw one of these Democrat congressmen, I have trouble pronouncing his name, sounds like Klingon.
[01:50:29.905 --> 01:50:31.506]  We're going to play a clip of it.
[01:50:32.067 --> 01:50:37.931]  Just during the break, I was just literally getting a cup of coffee in my DrudgeReport.com cup.
[01:50:37.951 --> 01:50:45.857]  By the way, this is my cup for like 10 years, so people stop using it and I find it in other people's offices.
[01:50:46.337 --> 01:50:48.359]  I have to go find this every routinely, my cup.
[01:50:48.779 --> 01:50:49.560]  Leave it alone, it's mine!
[01:50:51.007 --> 01:50:53.568]  I'm not an authoritarian around here, but keep your hands off my damn cup.
[01:50:54.768 --> 01:50:57.510]  And I'm sitting there watching Fox News like five minutes ago.
[01:50:59.350 --> 01:51:03.752]  We've got all these TVs on and it's like, there's no reality here.
[01:51:03.812 --> 01:51:04.892]  Nothing's happening on the border.
[01:51:04.912 --> 01:51:05.493]  Everything's fine.
[01:51:05.513 --> 01:51:08.694]  And it's just like, where does it end with these people?
[01:51:11.035 --> 01:51:11.635]  What are they doing?
[01:51:11.675 --> 01:51:15.216]  I think you're that dumb to act like you heard Trump say, we're a nation.
[01:51:15.296 --> 01:51:18.578]  God, I can't believe the FCC will let him say that dirty word.
[01:51:19.218 --> 01:51:19.438]  Yeah.
[01:51:20.410 --> 01:51:21.912]  Next we'll tell you Ducks Quack.
[01:51:22.713 --> 01:51:23.534]  I know it's crazy.
[01:51:23.554 --> 01:51:26.759]  We've got a whole bunch of these clips coming up next hour.
[01:51:26.779 --> 01:51:27.800]  We've got a special guest joining us.
[01:51:29.182 --> 01:51:32.426]  And I'm gonna open the phones up too, but let's play just the latest one.
[01:51:32.446 --> 01:51:35.771]  I just hit pause on the TV in there and we've got the DVR wired in here.
[01:51:36.051 --> 01:51:37.473]  Here's Fox News like six minutes ago.
[01:51:37.513 --> 01:51:37.774]  Here it is.
[01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:44.778]  I thought that Donald Trump made a speech that's completely inconsistent with reality.
[01:51:44.878 --> 01:51:51.587]  It could have been something that we heard at a rally, not something that we should hear from an Oval Office presentation.
[01:51:57.008 --> 01:52:01.652]  With huge waves of people smashing over borders, and death and disease, the U.N.
[01:52:01.692 --> 01:52:04.974]  admitting record TB, all of it pouring across into U.S.
[01:52:04.994 --> 01:52:05.535]  schoolrooms.
[01:52:05.575 --> 01:52:06.556]  That's in the news today.
[01:52:07.416 --> 01:52:13.601]  And all these attacks going on, and he says there was no reality in it.
[01:52:14.482 --> 01:52:15.383]  Well, his clip's nothing.
[01:52:15.423 --> 01:52:22.829]  In fact, I've got all the clips here where they say there is no child smuggling, there is no human smuggling, there is no caravan.
[01:52:26.553 --> 01:52:28.274]  Other clips, no one wants your guns!
[01:52:29.094 --> 01:52:31.175]  They're everywhere saying, we will get your damn guns!
[01:52:31.415 --> 01:52:32.635]  And look, no one wants your guns!
[01:52:39.458 --> 01:52:51.842]  But the greatest illustration of this that I've seen so far is a story on Infowars.com about their fact-checking Trump speech, you know.
[01:52:52.203 --> 01:52:55.844]  CNN has this thing where they put up thousands of gumballs and say, that's every lie!
[01:52:57.381 --> 01:52:58.982]  Like, look, Pinocchio's nose is growing.
[01:52:59.802 --> 01:53:10.088]  And if you actually look at what Trump's done, he's backed off on a few promises, gotten done the lion's share of what he said he would do, or tried, and then you fact-check every fact-check they do.
[01:53:10.108 --> 01:53:12.070]  Here's an example.
[01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:24.016]  PolitiFactSnopes have articles saying, is it true the UN wants to flood North America with 600 million, quote, migrants by 2050?
[01:53:26.519 --> 01:53:30.600]  And you read their fact check, and it says, false, totally false.
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:40.022]  You read the first few paragraphs, and you read the bottom, it says, it's true it's a UN document, and it's true blah blah blah, but they don't mean to implement it.
[01:53:45.983 --> 01:53:46.724]  That's what they do.
[01:53:46.964 --> 01:53:49.384]  So, they had a fact check.
[01:53:49.524 --> 01:53:52.345]  Trump has been told to be very conservative by his fact checkers, so they're like,
[01:53:53.738 --> 01:53:58.402]  Amnesty International says 60-80% get raped on their way here.
[01:54:00.184 --> 01:54:02.046]  And other numbers show that's similar.
[01:54:02.486 --> 01:54:03.347]  Just say 1 in 3.
[01:54:04.868 --> 01:54:08.772]  So Trump says 1 in 3 women coming up from Latin America get raped before they get here.
[01:54:08.812 --> 01:54:13.236]  This is wrong, and it's out of control to have an uncontrolled giant corridor.
[01:54:14.237 --> 01:54:16.979]  I don't like all the extra stuff at airports, but you should have it at your borders.
[01:54:16.999 --> 01:54:19.902]  But we have it at airports, but not at borders.
[01:54:23.484 --> 01:54:31.209]  And so there's Trump saying this, and then CBS News fact-checks it and goes, oh, he said one in three.
[01:54:31.269 --> 01:54:31.829]  He's wrong.
[01:54:31.909 --> 01:54:32.030]  It's 80%.
[01:54:32.190 --> 01:54:35.912]  I scroll down and show him the screenshots.
[01:54:36.372 --> 01:54:38.874]  They removed the article.
[01:54:41.496 --> 01:54:44.077]  So the fact-checker wasn't thinking, like, oh, we've got Trump.
[01:54:44.598 --> 01:54:47.159]  It's at least twice as bad as he's saying.
[01:54:47.179 --> 01:54:48.340]  80% are getting raped.
[01:54:49.946 --> 01:54:53.049]  And they went, wait a minute, idiot, that makes his point.
[01:54:54.130 --> 01:54:57.034]  That's Amnesty International and liberal groups saying that, pull it down.
[01:54:58.675 --> 01:55:04.922]  Just like, oh, some witness says they saw a white guy, might have been at the scene that a little black girl got killed.
[01:55:05.282 --> 01:55:08.446]  Oh my God, there's a white supremacist on the loose, he's gonna kill everybody!
[01:55:10.196 --> 01:55:18.118]  Turns out the sheriff and others had the tip of the name, and who it turned out to be, who's pled guilty, and everything, and didn't act on it.
[01:55:18.359 --> 01:55:24.200]  Law enforcement separately pulled over one of the two, and thought they were acting suspicious, then found out more, and the guy confessed.
[01:55:24.901 --> 01:55:31.563]  So, you'd still be hearing about little Jasmine killed by the white devil, and the sheriff would be all over the news.
[01:55:31.623 --> 01:55:35.664]  Sheriff Gonzales, I'm gonna stop these white supremacists, you better believe it!
[01:55:37.005 --> 01:55:38.285]  When he sat on his hands.
[01:55:39.326 --> 01:55:40.486]  But thank God other police didn't.
[01:55:42.967 --> 01:55:44.527]  That's a group of dirtbags, folks.
[01:55:46.528 --> 01:55:48.128]  That's a group of dirtbags right there.
[01:55:49.729 --> 01:55:53.110]  And it's what they do all day long, 24-7.
[01:55:53.130 --> 01:56:00.052]  Maybe, maybe it's just an accident that he got the exact tip.
[01:56:01.041 --> 01:56:05.624]  And he and the main Black Lives Matter activist just kept it to themselves.
[01:56:05.904 --> 01:56:06.745]  Because they said that.
[01:56:06.785 --> 01:56:17.112]  They said, we think the idea that two black men killed this little girl in cold blood for no reason is just, what was the exact statement?
[01:56:17.192 --> 01:56:18.773]  It's in the local news.
[01:56:19.553 --> 01:56:22.035]  Was just too improbable.
[01:56:24.296 --> 01:56:27.999]  Let me see, about 95% of blacks are killed by blacks.
[01:56:31.687 --> 01:56:35.230]  But it's improbable that black people would kill black people.
[01:56:35.250 --> 01:56:36.390]  Okay?
[01:56:37.611 --> 01:56:37.951]  Again.
[01:56:41.774 --> 01:56:43.575]  Maybe the sheriff's got a 70 IQ.
[01:56:45.817 --> 01:56:47.258]  Or he's really evil.
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.523]  Because he learns on Wednesday afternoon exactly who did it from a tip and doesn't report it.
[01:56:55.364 --> 01:56:56.905]  And doesn't act on it.
[01:56:58.208 --> 01:57:01.510]  And keeps going, even after they'd already busted.
[01:57:04.352 --> 01:57:10.215]  The gentleman that ended the scumbags, that ended up admitting that they did it, they were still tweeting.
[01:57:10.995 --> 01:57:12.816]  Favorously to get more Twitter followers.
[01:57:13.637 --> 01:57:14.938]  On the big Twitter bonanza.
[01:57:15.338 --> 01:57:16.439]  The race war bonanza.
[01:57:16.459 --> 01:57:17.879]  Just like a slot machine.
[01:57:23.142 --> 01:57:23.443]  White!
[01:57:23.603 --> 01:57:23.863]  Whites!
[01:57:24.023 --> 01:57:24.783]  Whites are killing us!
[01:57:24.883 --> 01:57:25.124]  White!
[01:57:25.184 --> 01:57:25.384]  White!
[01:57:25.424 --> 01:57:25.624]  White!
[01:57:25.684 --> 01:57:25.864]  White!
[01:57:25.924 --> 01:57:26.104]  White!
[01:57:26.144 --> 01:57:26.364]  White!
[01:57:26.885 --> 01:57:27.285]  Meanwhile,
[01:57:29.028 --> 01:57:31.769]  You don't do a damn thing to stop your kids actually getting killed.
[01:57:33.610 --> 01:57:34.351]  Makes me sick.
[01:57:35.151 --> 01:57:37.012]  I don't care what color you are.
[01:57:37.112 --> 01:57:38.873]  Black baby, white baby, whatever.
[01:57:39.353 --> 01:57:40.173]  I care about babies.
[01:57:41.054 --> 01:57:51.819]  But I'm sure as hell tired of all these so-called minorities teamed up with the globalists running around on their racist anti-white crusade that's going absolutely nowhere but to societal collapse.
[01:57:52.339 --> 01:57:52.699]  We are...
[01:57:59.696 --> 01:58:01.417]  Let's go to Wildman in Illinois.
[01:58:01.457 --> 01:58:03.779]  Thanks for holding, and not to say Happy New Year.
[01:58:03.799 --> 01:58:04.099]  Go ahead.
[01:58:04.399 --> 01:58:13.885]  Alex, yeah, going into 2019, what Trump's got to do to save America, he's got to declassify FISA, expose the corruption, arrest the traitors, and arrest the pedophiles.
[01:58:13.925 --> 01:58:15.086]  That's how he saves America.
[01:58:15.146 --> 01:58:18.888]  My opinion, an over-the-road trucker, hard-working, honest man, that's what I believe.
[01:58:19.128 --> 01:58:19.428]  I agree.
[01:58:19.508 --> 01:58:20.269]  Victory or death.
[01:58:20.309 --> 01:58:21.990]  He's now, looks like he's cleaning house.
[01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:23.831]  He's getting rid of all the double agents.
[01:58:23.851 --> 01:58:26.913]  And the word is Trump is going to go into battle now.
[01:58:27.293 --> 01:58:29.574]  We're talking he's going to strike back against the censorship.
[01:58:29.594 --> 01:58:31.295]  He's going to strike back against the pedophile rings.
[01:58:31.355 --> 01:58:31.896]  It's already begun.
[01:58:31.916 --> 01:58:33.997]  He's going to strike back against the deep state.
[01:58:34.477 --> 01:58:39.820]  He's going to strike back against all the criminal activity of Comey and Mueller being Russian operatives.
[01:58:40.181 --> 01:58:40.801]  So just get ready.
[01:58:41.081 --> 01:58:41.581]  I'd say.
[01:58:41.621 --> 01:58:45.222]  Another note, I've spent over $3,000 in your store this year.
[01:58:45.423 --> 01:58:47.883]  I'm a loyal supporter, and thanks for great products.
[01:58:48.063 --> 01:58:49.104]  Brother, let me tell you something.
[01:58:49.164 --> 01:58:50.384]  I want to thank you.
[01:58:50.564 --> 01:58:57.807]  If folks like you didn't stand with us against the incredible Hillary Clinton and Soros attacks, which they admit they're running, we would not be here now.
[01:58:58.547 --> 01:58:59.988]  They're taking Michael Savage off the air.
[01:59:00.409 --> 01:59:02.150]  They're taking everybody.
[01:59:02.190 --> 01:59:03.991]  They took Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[01:59:04.011 --> 01:59:07.134]  They need to get us all off the air before they make their move on Trump.
[01:59:07.174 --> 01:59:09.076]  That's why this is a war.
[01:59:09.616 --> 01:59:11.097]  And you supporting us is incredible.
[01:59:11.357 --> 01:59:12.658]  Which products do you like the best?
[01:59:12.799 --> 01:59:14.360]  Man, I use the bodies.
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:15.961]  I got so many t-shirts.
[01:59:15.981 --> 01:59:16.782]  It ain't even funny.
[01:59:16.842 --> 01:59:21.446]  I got your stickers posted on my hard hat, on my GPS, my truck.
[01:59:21.886 --> 01:59:25.469]  I tell truckers about you over the CB Airways all across the country.
[01:59:25.769 --> 01:59:26.910]  I spread the word about you.
[01:59:27.090 --> 01:59:27.891]  I wear your clothes.
[01:59:28.271 --> 01:59:30.712]  Your hats, your shirts, you name it.
[01:59:30.772 --> 01:59:31.973]  Multitude of products.
[01:59:32.273 --> 01:59:35.935]  How much love do you get versus, how much love versus hate do you get?
[01:59:35.955 --> 01:59:42.839]  Um, you know, it's uh, people skeptical, but like, it's probably about 50-50 or 60-40 year way.
[01:59:42.899 --> 01:59:45.700]  I just, I guess so many people got their head in the sand out here.
[01:59:55.427 --> 01:59:59.532]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.552 --> 02:00:01.375]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:34.366 --> 02:00:40.088]  You know, I haven't even gotten into a lot of the stacks of news I have here in front of me.
[02:00:41.648 --> 02:00:44.309]  And when I'm wrong about something, I'll say I'm wrong about it.
[02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:50.832]  But I was not wrong when I boldly said Trump set to declare a national emergency over the border.
[02:00:52.652 --> 02:00:54.413]  Because they'd been signaling they were going to do it.
[02:00:54.493 --> 02:00:55.833]  But what he did was change course.
[02:00:58.654 --> 02:00:59.675]  And that's not a good thing.
[02:01:00.815 --> 02:01:03.256]  He's made statements he still may declare the state of emergency.
[02:01:03.316 --> 02:01:03.636]  Oh yeah.
[02:01:05.609 --> 02:01:11.711]  You may release the FISA warrants fully showing the illegal BS that Mueller involved himself in.
[02:01:11.731 --> 02:01:12.351]  Then do it!
[02:01:15.092 --> 02:01:22.174]  Because our asses are hanging out here in the breeze with the globalists breathing down our neck.
[02:01:26.215 --> 02:01:28.156]  And you know, you gotta be careful what you ask for.
[02:01:31.877 --> 02:01:34.478]  I told listeners to go in these so-called gay bars
[02:01:36.018 --> 02:01:42.782]  Legally and lawfully, don't be violent, if they choose the citizens, where they have little kids performing doing drag.
[02:01:43.142 --> 02:01:44.483]  And I said, it's obviously pedophilic.
[02:01:45.343 --> 02:01:51.346]  And did you know people did it and got recordings of people talking about screwing kids?
[02:01:52.167 --> 02:01:54.508]  Yeah.
[02:01:54.548 --> 02:02:03.813]  You know, an entire group of law enforcement would have to deal with that for a month to decide what was going to happen and what was going to go on and who was involved and everything.
[02:02:06.636 --> 02:02:09.297]  And obviously I told the people, I said, you need to give that to law enforcement.
[02:02:14.658 --> 02:02:17.918]  And I think that's what it comes down to is I do need like a month-long vacation.
[02:02:18.239 --> 02:02:19.499]  And I don't feel sorry for myself.
[02:02:21.039 --> 02:02:22.179]  I'm not bitching and complaining.
[02:02:22.499 --> 02:02:26.780]  I just, I'm like a police detective that has 50,000 files.
[02:02:27.401 --> 02:02:29.901]  And I feel guilty that I can't deal with all these damn things.
[02:02:30.501 --> 02:02:33.622]  And they're all out of the park grand slammers.
[02:02:35.731 --> 02:02:39.153]  I mean, we are overrun by devil-worshipping pedophiles.
[02:02:42.074 --> 02:02:51.760]  I mean, you want to know at the bottom of the barrel, the bottom of the damn rabbit hole, what you're going to find, it's kid-screwing and kid-murdering vampires.
[02:02:53.501 --> 02:02:58.763]  And... I'm just mad at myself.
[02:03:01.765 --> 02:03:02.625]  Get it off screen.
[02:03:02.665 --> 02:03:03.426]  Just get it off.
[02:03:05.199 --> 02:03:06.319]  I'm not mad at the crew playing it.
[02:03:06.839 --> 02:03:09.760]  Normally I'd say, I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:03:14.901 --> 02:03:20.483]  And the fact that we've got to sit here and beg people to care and beg people to get involved.
[02:03:22.163 --> 02:03:24.284]  And then even when they do get involved, which is great.
[02:03:25.546 --> 02:03:31.470]  The crap you hear from the bar owners and you're just a sliminess.
[02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:36.893]  It's like, this isn't like watching a movie or reading about evil.
[02:03:37.974 --> 02:03:45.818]  When you know it's there and you hear it's confidence, and you know it's just gonna get worse and worse.
[02:03:51.062 --> 02:03:53.023]  Because of the selfishness of the average person.
[02:03:59.932 --> 02:04:01.232]  I'm going to tell you something right now.
[02:04:03.653 --> 02:04:12.076]  It's good to fight evil and it's good to go up against the globalists so that people who are partly awake become fully awake so they get a relationship with God.
[02:04:14.056 --> 02:04:16.697]  And so they recognize evil in their life so they make that decision.
[02:04:17.177 --> 02:04:18.078]  It's all about souls.
[02:04:18.878 --> 02:04:20.298]  You're not going to save this planet.
[02:04:22.419 --> 02:04:25.900]  Let me tell you, everything you see in the near future
[02:04:27.558 --> 02:04:29.719]  20 years, 30 years, it's going to be burned to a crisp.
[02:04:30.419 --> 02:04:33.341]  All these big buildings, all these globals are going to be deader than a hammer.
[02:04:34.321 --> 02:04:41.024]  Just like Christ told them in Jerusalem when the Pharisees were getting ready to haul him up and kill him, he said, you see these stones of this wall?
[02:04:42.865 --> 02:04:45.567]  In your lifetimes, there won't be one stone on top of the other.
[02:04:45.947 --> 02:04:47.607]  Now, I'm not Jesus Christ.
[02:04:48.768 --> 02:04:54.691]  I'm just telling you as a political operative and a researcher that cares about humanity, I can tell you right now,
[02:04:55.731 --> 02:04:58.475]  These globalists are crazy, and they're going to destroy everything.
[02:04:59.557 --> 02:05:01.360]  But not before they rape the hell out of your kids.
[02:05:05.914 --> 02:05:13.699]  Hey, what happens if you try to order your favorite InfoWars Life product only to find out they're sold out?
[02:05:13.719 --> 02:05:17.702]  Yeah, I know it kind of sucks, but there is a solution.

[02:05:23.106 --> 02:05:23.486]  Bam!
[02:05:23.726 --> 02:05:25.927]  Problem solved just like that.
[02:05:26.288 --> 02:05:29.030]  And now you're scheduled for regular delivery.
[02:05:29.190 --> 02:05:35.494]  That means no more back orders and you'll never run out of your favorite InfoWars Life products
[02:05:35.774 --> 02:05:36.154]  Again.
[02:05:36.514 --> 02:05:36.955]  Pretty cool.
[02:05:37.215 --> 02:05:37.815]  But guess what?
[02:05:38.095 --> 02:05:38.816]  It gets better.

[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:48.060]  Woo!
[02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:49.301]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:05:49.321 --> 02:05:50.922]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:05:51.302 --> 02:05:53.003]  Support the InfoWar.
[02:05:53.543 --> 02:05:58.386]  Order and click on AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:06.298 --> 02:06:19.546]  It's for border security directly to the American people today with his first televised Oval Office address tonight.
[02:06:19.566 --> 02:06:23.549]  Do you think it should be, I don't know, a delay of some sort?
[02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:25.310]  Why in the world would the networks
[02:06:26.305 --> 02:06:34.449]  Why should they run Donald Trump's address tonight when we know that Donald Trump is going to be using it to spread these lies?
[02:06:34.469 --> 02:06:35.550]  Because people believe it.
[02:06:35.890 --> 02:06:37.271]  The president will say what he has to say.
[02:06:37.931 --> 02:06:39.952]  People will believe it whether the facts are true or not.
[02:06:40.052 --> 02:06:46.616]  Why should they run Donald Trump's address tonight when they know he's going to be spreading lies and falsehoods?
[02:06:46.656 --> 02:06:49.197]  The answer to your question, Joe, is they shouldn't.
[02:06:49.437 --> 02:06:52.519]  One of the most time-honored and powerful ways a president has
[02:06:52.819 --> 02:06:57.423]  To communicate with the American people is through a primetime Oval Office address.
[02:06:58.024 --> 02:07:01.767]  The majesty of the setting, the request for valuable television time.
[02:07:01.908 --> 02:07:04.410]  The president says he wants airtime, he just gets it, right?
[02:07:04.650 --> 02:07:06.352]  Well, the answer is no.
[02:07:06.452 --> 02:07:09.355]  President Trump, you will not get your wall.
[02:07:22.708 --> 02:07:24.930]  That's immorality, not who we are as a nation.
[02:07:25.230 --> 02:07:31.955]  Have you considered using emergency powers to grant yourself authorities to build this wall without congressional approval?
[02:07:32.516 --> 02:07:32.956]  Yes, I have.
[02:07:33.276 --> 02:07:34.137]  And I can do it if I want.
[02:07:34.257 --> 02:07:38.341]  And so he doesn't need the Congress to appropriate the funds for the wall, he can just do it?
[02:07:38.481 --> 02:07:40.282]  You don't need congressional approval to build it?
[02:07:40.302 --> 02:07:41.683]  No, we can use them, absolutely.
[02:07:41.743 --> 02:07:46.247]  We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely.
[02:07:46.347 --> 02:07:49.650]  It's now up to you to decide which sides you're on.
[02:07:50.650 --> 02:07:51.471]  That's where we are.
[02:07:52.131 --> 02:08:03.759]  And Trump is moving in the right direction and the only direction he has to use his constitutional executive power against traitors in the government to declare a national emergency and take matters into his own hands.
[02:08:04.399 --> 02:08:06.140]  Our destities are now bound forever.
[02:08:06.901 --> 02:08:16.167]  We ask you to now take action and declare the national emergency and clear the scourge of the foreign globalist infestation threatening America and the world.
[02:08:16.912 --> 02:08:19.033]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:19.553 --> 02:08:24.774]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:26.995 --> 02:08:30.496]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[02:08:30.856 --> 02:08:34.317]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[02:08:34.718 --> 02:08:38.039]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[02:08:38.339 --> 02:08:42.460]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[02:09:13.494 --> 02:09:19.076]  Cause it's all over.
[02:09:23.658 --> 02:09:25.339]  For the unknown soldier.
[02:09:38.704 --> 02:09:39.845]  Alright, listen.
[02:09:40.814 --> 02:09:44.777]  I've already had a bunch of guests on that have been extremely powerful and Owen Benjamin's always great.
[02:09:46.118 --> 02:09:48.760]  One of the top comedians in the country and one of the most censored people in the country.
[02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:50.201]  I like seeing him pop in our shows.
[02:09:50.241 --> 02:09:51.242]  He always has great commentary.
[02:09:51.262 --> 02:09:52.463]  He's with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:09:52.483 --> 02:09:54.665]  I do intend to take a few calls in the next few segments as well.
[02:09:55.185 --> 02:10:09.016]  There's a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to of just the most bizarre stuff and I like the fact that Owen Benjamin talks about rhetoric because he's researched that because I want to get his take on
[02:10:10.370 --> 02:10:14.532]  Every channel, we already played these clips last hour, saying it's crazy.
[02:10:14.572 --> 02:10:16.833]  There's no human trafficking.
[02:10:17.413 --> 02:10:18.113]  Trump says it.
[02:10:18.313 --> 02:10:19.034]  It's insane.
[02:10:19.074 --> 02:10:21.235]  And there's no caravan.
[02:10:22.095 --> 02:10:23.456]  It's totally made up.
[02:10:23.476 --> 02:10:24.056]  He's insane.
[02:10:24.676 --> 02:10:25.957]  Meanwhile, Europe's been flooded.
[02:10:26.577 --> 02:10:27.377]  We're being flooded.
[02:10:27.517 --> 02:10:28.238]  Mass death.
[02:10:28.698 --> 02:10:30.599]  Huge amounts of sex trading.
[02:10:30.679 --> 02:10:31.459]  Senate reports.
[02:10:32.299 --> 02:10:32.920]  All this stuff.
[02:10:34.380 --> 02:10:35.121]  80% of the women are raped.
[02:10:35.181 --> 02:10:36.262]  Trump says 1 third are.
[02:10:36.282 --> 02:10:38.083]  And they go, fact check, it's 80%.
[02:10:38.143 --> 02:10:39.123]  You liar, it's way worse.
[02:10:39.283 --> 02:10:39.624]  Oh, wait.
[02:10:39.964 --> 02:10:40.764]  CBS, take it down.
[02:10:41.005 --> 02:10:41.385]  Oh, God!
[02:10:42.425 --> 02:10:44.727]  It's our own liberal Amnesty International.
[02:10:46.568 --> 02:10:47.949]  This is not even a tactic now.
[02:10:48.009 --> 02:10:49.330]  This is like an obstinate...
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:51.541]  It's wizardry.
[02:10:51.601 --> 02:10:57.284]  I call it wizardry because it's a lot easier for people to understand what that means as opposed to the word rhetoric.
[02:11:15.319 --> 02:11:25.187]  Because, you know, my dad taught rhetoric, like mass persuasion, and my mom taught children's literature, which is basically how to boil down a narrative to the simplest elements.
[02:11:25.227 --> 02:11:26.508]  So that was my upbringing.
[02:11:27.129 --> 02:11:33.394]  And it's so interesting watching all these tactics in real time right now, just changing the course of a nation.
[02:11:33.434 --> 02:11:35.736]  And what they're doing, it's repetition.
[02:11:36.411 --> 02:11:39.294]  It's just saying the same thing over and over and over again.
[02:11:39.314 --> 02:11:51.025]  It allows people that don't want to face the reality of fentanyl and the reality of the rapes happening as people flood the border and the reality that a nation can't exist.
[02:11:51.701 --> 02:12:04.387]  Without a border, and the reality that the very people that are going against Trump, they're on camera saying that we need a border wall, you know, ten years ago, and so what's happening is it allows people... Oh, I forgot that!
[02:12:04.467 --> 02:12:16.733]  We've got hundreds of clips of Hillary and Schumer and Pelosi and Obama and Bill Clinton saying we've got to have a wall, the crime, a lot of criminals, it's all true, but somehow they flipped and now say it's totally insane!
[02:12:17.728 --> 02:12:25.213]  Well yeah, well that's the thing that Trump's doing is he's actually doing what he said he would do and that's seen as evil by a lot of these people.
[02:12:25.394 --> 02:12:39.024]  It's almost like the family whose dad left when they were kids and the mom just keeps saying dad will come back and that hope allows people to get through Christmas even though dad's never coming back.
[02:12:39.064 --> 02:12:41.906]  That's almost how politics work in America now where they say
[02:12:42.526 --> 02:12:48.269]  Border security, you know, will tighten up government spending and then they never do.
[02:12:48.810 --> 02:12:56.714]  And that promise and then the lack of doing anything is okay on the American people right now because their attention span is that of goldfish.
[02:12:57.414 --> 02:13:08.981]  So the wizardry is going crazy and then Trump just doing what he said he would do, like leaving Syria when they said... No, I know, but then I tune in and they're all in lockstep saying the sky's not blue.
[02:13:09.601 --> 02:13:10.302]  It makes me feel...
[02:13:11.417 --> 02:13:12.478]  Not even angry anymore.
[02:13:12.498 --> 02:13:14.439]  It's like, who the hell are these people?
[02:13:14.699 --> 02:13:16.419]  These people are dangerous as hell.
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:18.801]  They do not need to control the nuclear weapons.
[02:13:19.741 --> 02:13:20.582]  No, they're wizards.
[02:13:20.622 --> 02:13:24.363]  They have a narrative, and a narrative is very, very powerful.
[02:13:24.764 --> 02:13:37.150]  And just like what people do with children, or what people do with mass propaganda and psychological operations, it's just a narrative, repetition, repetition, emotional triggers, emotional triggers, and it's...
[02:13:38.805 --> 02:13:46.590]  There's millions of people like me and you who watch your show, watch my live streams, and they feel just like us.
[02:13:47.131 --> 02:13:51.774]  It's just madness, but it's effective on a certain type of person.
[02:13:52.034 --> 02:13:53.955]  A certain type that doesn't have a memory.
[02:13:54.436 --> 02:13:58.358]  You read the Globalist documents or hear Gruber, they say, the key is they have no memory.
[02:13:58.598 --> 02:14:00.560]  We were successful getting rid of attention spans.
[02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:01.340]  Ha ha ha!
[02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:05.283]  Because the average person does not remember any of this.
[02:14:06.485 --> 02:14:17.213]  Yeah, that's why my mom, I used to think she was wacky for this policy, but she, for her, her wristwatch has to have hands on it because she said a digital watch erases memory.
[02:14:17.734 --> 02:14:22.297]  And she said she wants to know where the hand came from and where it's going.
[02:14:22.357 --> 02:14:24.579]  And I used to think that that was, that was weird.
[02:14:24.639 --> 02:14:28.622]  And now I totally understand where she's coming from, that it's the littlest things in your day.
[02:14:29.322 --> 02:14:30.183]  And the digitalization of everything.
[02:14:30.203 --> 02:14:37.108]  No, exactly, because an old-fashioned watch is a map of a universe, and you know there was time before and after, but digital's only now.
[02:14:37.988 --> 02:14:38.429]  Exactly.
[02:14:38.449 --> 02:14:39.149]  Well, that's heavy.
[02:14:39.169 --> 02:14:40.310]  Does your mom come up with that?
[02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:41.091]  That's damn heavy.
[02:14:41.571 --> 02:14:43.232]  Yeah, my mom's brilliant with this stuff.
[02:14:43.272 --> 02:14:56.722]  She's very, very, you know, she was... We never had new clothes, and we grew our food, and she was doing all that stuff before it was cool, because she saw it coming a mile away, and she quit working to raise
[02:14:57.721 --> 02:15:06.192]  My brother and I and, you know, all the feminists said that she was giving up and she was like, no, feminism means I get to choose my life and I want to be a mother.
[02:15:06.332 --> 02:15:07.774]  And so she was way ahead of the curve.
[02:15:07.834 --> 02:15:11.539]  And that watch thing is so true.
[02:15:11.819 --> 02:15:13.762]  And you can apply it to so many things where
[02:15:14.503 --> 02:15:23.891]  Digital is authoritarian when it says it is 12.15, it is 11.15, but if you see the hands, where they come from and where they're going, you can put your world into context.
[02:15:24.391 --> 02:15:31.837]  And the one thing... And you also wind it, and you check the time yourself, and it's you control time instead of it being this digital thing.
[02:15:32.758 --> 02:15:33.439]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:15:33.479 --> 02:15:35.701]  And you're responsible for keeping it going.
[02:15:35.721 --> 02:15:38.463]  There's so much metaphor in that.
[02:15:38.923 --> 02:15:43.267]  And slaves are not allowed to have context, and they're trying to turn us all into slaves.
[02:15:44.574 --> 02:15:45.214]  That is heavy.
[02:15:45.634 --> 02:15:48.995]  I mean, that's like when Trump said the deepest thing I ever did was becoming shallow.
[02:15:49.215 --> 02:15:49.956]  They go, what an idiot.
[02:15:50.016 --> 02:15:52.376]  No, he means go with your first approximation.
[02:15:52.436 --> 02:15:53.357]  That's actually what's deep.
[02:15:54.177 --> 02:15:55.277]  Owen Benjamin's our guest.
[02:15:55.557 --> 02:15:57.898]  HugePianist.com, AlexJonesNewsWars.com.
[02:15:57.958 --> 02:15:58.518]  Spread that link.
[02:15:58.558 --> 02:15:58.959]  Thank you.
[02:16:06.881 --> 02:16:12.543]  Conservatively, there have been several thousand articles written in the last three years
[02:16:13.757 --> 02:16:18.859]  Demonizing Info Wars, and yours truly, for selling high-quality supplements.
[02:16:20.060 --> 02:16:38.528]  In fact, even the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, that owns the biggest sellers of supplements in the world, even that organization has written hit pieces claiming, I'm a fraud in selling snake oil, when they're owned by a man who owns Amazon and Whole Foods.
[02:16:40.217 --> 02:16:42.218]  Amazon was the number one supplement seller in the world.
[02:16:42.598 --> 02:16:43.438]  Whole Foods was number two.
[02:16:44.319 --> 02:16:49.681]  He owns the number one and number two biggest supplement sellers on the planet.
[02:16:51.201 --> 02:16:57.424]  And then his publication, a weaponized disinformation op, says I'm bad and should be shut down.
[02:16:58.766 --> 02:17:12.433]  When more than 15 of the 70 products we have at InfoWarsLife.com are private labeled, highest quality, top of the line, that are sold at Whole Foods for higher prices.
[02:17:13.334 --> 02:17:15.435]  Think about the level of that fraud.
[02:17:16.356 --> 02:17:19.237]  And I've sent messages to these news organizations pointing that out.
[02:17:19.417 --> 02:17:20.018]  No response.
[02:17:20.238 --> 02:17:21.198]  They never want to get my comment.
[02:17:21.759 --> 02:17:22.639]  Now, why am I saying that?
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:24.320]  It's simple.
[02:17:25.373 --> 02:17:29.917]  We have a lot of proprietary original products, but a lot of them are also private labeled.
[02:17:30.317 --> 02:17:35.602]  Whatever already has five stars, whatever people already love, whatever's been tested to be the best.
[02:17:36.262 --> 02:17:37.503]  So we have a great product.
[02:17:37.603 --> 02:17:38.024]  You love it.
[02:17:38.084 --> 02:17:38.704]  You reorder it.
[02:17:39.105 --> 02:17:41.346]  The Globals are going to test our products, trying to find something.
[02:17:41.827 --> 02:17:43.749]  So we're going to be able to, you know, defeat all that.
[02:17:43.909 --> 02:17:44.950]  It's a 360 win.
[02:17:45.310 --> 02:17:45.970]  We defeat them.
[02:17:46.050 --> 02:17:46.431]  You win.
[02:17:46.571 --> 02:17:46.891]  I win.
[02:17:47.211 --> 02:17:47.692]  It's amazing.
[02:17:49.562 --> 02:17:54.305]  And you've seen them come after our attempts to even process credit cards and shut down InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:17:54.325 --> 02:18:09.973]  I mean, it's incredible not just what frauds they are and how they're anti-free market and how they're racketeering against us, not just Jeff Bezos, but this entire system of mainstream media and mainstream corporations and banking are even worse than Bezos and Amazon.
[02:18:11.909 --> 02:18:12.409]  It's hard to believe.
[02:18:12.509 --> 02:18:15.231]  I'm just illustrating how crazy this all is.
[02:18:15.311 --> 02:18:22.814]  Now, I'm going to be cutting some informational pieces in the next few weeks that go into great depth on each one of the products.
[02:18:23.655 --> 02:18:25.896]  I've done this for some of the products, but I haven't done it in a while.
[02:18:25.916 --> 02:18:35.440]  I haven't done it for the new products because, quite frankly, it's like going to school for a college exam to try to accurately talk about how great these products are.
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:36.241]  But just know this.
[02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:46.365]  Whatever the attributes that Jeff Bezos and Amazon and Whole Foods are allowed to tell you about their flagship products, these are as good or better.
[02:18:46.705 --> 02:18:48.906]  These are all the top of the line, very best.
[02:18:49.646 --> 02:18:59.972]  I can't even tell you what they do and the history of it and how amazing they are because they selectively enforce and will send the FDA after us.
[02:19:00.792 --> 02:19:01.873]  You see, I'm a subhuman.
[02:19:01.993 --> 02:19:02.654]  I'm garbage.
[02:19:03.674 --> 02:19:05.315]  So Bezos can make all the claims.
[02:19:05.515 --> 02:19:06.816]  Whole Foods can make all the claims.
[02:19:08.007 --> 02:19:09.390]  Because this stuff is dynamite.
[02:19:09.991 --> 02:19:11.114]  Turmeric's dynamite.
[02:19:11.855 --> 02:19:13.539]  Iodine that's clean is dynamite.
[02:19:14.661 --> 02:19:16.345]  Super Mel Vitality, they have similar products.
[02:19:16.425 --> 02:19:17.127]  It's all dynamite.
[02:19:18.683 --> 02:19:22.545]  They can tell you how great it is, show you all the facts, and tell you, because they're the elite.
[02:19:22.885 --> 02:19:23.605]  I'm just scum.
[02:19:24.225 --> 02:19:25.126]  Just like you, according to them.
[02:19:25.186 --> 02:19:27.607]  But the good news is, you've seen how great these products work.
[02:19:27.967 --> 02:19:32.129]  We do break down some of the basics on each page at m4slife.com to see how wonderful they are.
[02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:48.016]  But experience turmeric, experience X3, experience Super Mel Vitality, Super Female Vitality, that by the way, is the last run of our best-selling product, Super Mel Vitality, Super Female, because we can't even get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, so we can't get the supply, and I'm sick of it, so I'm discontinuing it.
[02:19:48.536 --> 02:19:49.496]  Because it's so frustrating.
[02:19:49.517 --> 02:19:52.698]  This is the last run, and it's all 50% off.
[02:19:52.858 --> 02:19:57.720]  Bodies, X3, and Supermail at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:19:57.901 --> 02:19:58.741]  Thanks for your support.
[02:20:06.305 --> 02:20:08.926]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:15.644 --> 02:20:19.666]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:20:20.467 --> 02:20:21.908]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:20:22.168 --> 02:20:23.329]  Well, so does he.
[02:20:23.809 --> 02:20:28.533]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:30.374 --> 02:20:33.957]  So, the last few weeks now at the border wall has been the top story.
[02:20:34.117 --> 02:20:41.863]  I'm so sick of hearing Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer
[02:20:43.089 --> 02:20:46.432]  Talk about how I need a border wall, and say the exact same thing Trump said.
[02:20:46.692 --> 02:20:47.793]  Trump's just acting on it.
[02:20:49.754 --> 02:20:50.575]  That I haven't played it.
[02:20:50.655 --> 02:20:58.681]  But I think because of memory, and what Owen Benjamin was just saying, the comedian, analyst, huge pianist dot com, that's piano, pianist dot com.
[02:20:59.921 --> 02:21:14.524]  We should play a few minutes of it, and there's like hours of it, but let's play a few minutes of not just them 20 years ago, or 10 years ago, or even 5 years ago, or 3 years ago, but at some point, they decide to just flood everything, and again, it's the worst of the worst of the third world.
[02:21:15.084 --> 02:21:16.365]  They admit that.
[02:21:16.765 --> 02:21:20.926]  80% of the women coming up, Amnesty International admits get raped.
[02:21:21.006 --> 02:21:25.847]  I mean, that is the culture of the bad guys that run the smuggling.
[02:21:27.728 --> 02:21:37.253]  And then you see, oh, MS-13's All God's Children, Nancy Pelosi, and you see statements like, look, how dare he call Hispanics criminals?
[02:21:37.293 --> 02:21:39.694]  He was giving names of people that killed people.
[02:21:40.675 --> 02:21:43.076]  And an illegal alien is twice as likely to kill somebody.
[02:21:44.295 --> 02:21:46.917]  And by the way, something like 80% of it's Hispanics they kill.
[02:21:47.017 --> 02:21:58.925]  Hispanics are being fed on by Hispanic criminal gangs that our government says is hands-off and 900 plus cities say are sanctuary cities where you can come there and kill whoever the hell you want!
[02:22:00.165 --> 02:22:00.866]  And I'll tell you why.
[02:22:01.426 --> 02:22:02.907]  I know the immigration lawyers.
[02:22:03.788 --> 02:22:04.869]  I know they're inside baseball.
[02:22:05.683 --> 02:22:13.749]  I was first told about this 10 years ago by a judge, and then I was told about it by a prosecutor, and then I learned about it from insiders.
[02:22:13.769 --> 02:22:25.757]  And we're going to go back to our guest and play this clip, but they make, let's say an illegal alien gets $15,000, $20,000 a year off of welfare, and they make them work somewhere where they're paid like $30,000 a year.
[02:22:26.478 --> 02:22:29.580]  The left, through these groups, skims half that money.
[02:22:31.013 --> 02:22:35.943]  So, for every illegal alien that's an adult, they're getting $15,000, $30,000 a year.
[02:22:36.945 --> 02:22:40.812]  Oh, a kid though?
[02:22:41.213 --> 02:22:42.716]  So they're totally exploiting it.
[02:22:43.733 --> 02:22:52.861]  But since Owen Benjamin brought it up here, this is a shorter segment, long segment coming up, but here's that clip, one of the clips he was talking about, but then now they're saying, insane!
[02:22:52.941 --> 02:22:54.242]  A wall, that's crazy!
[02:22:54.282 --> 02:22:54.722]  Here it is.
[02:22:55.463 --> 02:23:08.113]  I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in.
[02:23:09.495 --> 02:23:12.077]  And I do think you have to control your borders.
[02:23:13.559 --> 02:23:29.090]  Real reform means stronger border security, and we can build on the progress my administration's already made, putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history, and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years.
[02:23:29.210 --> 02:23:38.957]  Real reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship, a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes, and a meaningful penalty.
[02:23:39.767 --> 02:23:45.371]  Learning English and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally.
[02:23:47.293 --> 02:23:49.254]  That's even more hardcore than Trump says!
[02:23:49.775 --> 02:23:52.056]  But now it's Hitlerian rhetoric!
[02:23:53.037 --> 02:23:54.358]  I can't listen to much more of this.
[02:23:55.959 --> 02:23:58.241]  We'll play some more in a moment, but Owen, this is what you're talking about.
[02:23:58.301 --> 02:24:01.123]  I mean, these people, they've got some bravado.
[02:24:01.904 --> 02:24:04.266]  Well, this is more wizardry that we're talking about.
[02:24:04.946 --> 02:24:08.349]  These people have established this narrative that they're protecting
[02:24:09.071 --> 02:24:18.797]  Black people and women and Hispanics and everyone else hates these demographics when in fact they're making a class of people in America that couldn't be more vulnerable.
[02:24:19.397 --> 02:24:33.125]  I used to live in Los Angeles and I would see these illegal maids and gardeners and all these people and they have to do what you say or else you get to send them back to their country and so they're in a constant state of fear.
[02:24:33.165 --> 02:24:35.847]  Oh no, it freaks me out at how much they kiss my ass.
[02:24:35.907 --> 02:24:37.327]  In fact, I want to empower them.
[02:24:37.448 --> 02:24:38.088]  It's the opposite.
[02:24:38.868 --> 02:24:39.348]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:24:39.468 --> 02:24:39.968]  No, totally.
[02:24:40.008 --> 02:24:40.569]  That's the thing.
[02:24:41.269 --> 02:24:46.910]  I'd rather have people come with paperwork and with a social security number and stuff like that.
[02:24:46.950 --> 02:24:47.931]  And with their chin up!
[02:24:48.411 --> 02:24:50.692]  Not being controlled by Democrats and turned into victims.
[02:24:51.612 --> 02:24:52.072]  Exactly.
[02:24:52.132 --> 02:24:58.754]  So they'll establish a $15, $18 minimum wage in Seattle or something and they'll feel so good.
[02:24:59.194 --> 02:25:00.995]  So they bring in these folks and undercut it.
[02:25:01.595 --> 02:25:02.135]  Exactly.
[02:25:02.155 --> 02:25:02.755]  And then they pay $8.
[02:25:02.795 --> 02:25:03.075]  And then these
[02:25:05.775 --> 02:25:17.927]  These people make it seem like Americans don't want any of these jobs, where I not that long ago, when I was first blackballed from clubs for the trans kid thing, I was doing manual labor with my brother, who's an arborist.
[02:25:18.327 --> 02:25:24.293]  And I'm telling you right now, there's plenty of Americans that have their undercut by illegal
[02:25:24.693 --> 02:25:28.677]  Well let's say it, the illegal aliens because they're subsidized with welfare by design.
[02:25:28.697 --> 02:25:34.542]  Remember when the head of Walmart said, oh we keep the wages so low that our employees get welfare.
[02:25:35.142 --> 02:25:43.450]  Well yeah, so it bankrupts the system, Walmart uses a subsidy, that's the whole model of illegals or Appalachian whites or poor blacks in Alabama.
[02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:48.074]  It's the same corporate model of they get these low-paying jobs that undercut everybody
[02:25:48.354 --> 02:25:51.939]  And then there's the welfare that then supplements what the taxpayers pay for.
[02:25:52.199 --> 02:25:54.322]  So the bottom line is folks, none of us are getting this for free.
[02:25:54.542 --> 02:25:55.664]  We are screwing ourselves.
[02:25:56.380 --> 02:25:59.482]  Yeah, and American citizens can't work these wages.
[02:25:59.522 --> 02:26:08.507]  Like, if I said, listen, I'll work $8 an hour, you don't have to pay a workman's comp, they'd say, no, you have a social security number, so you can't, so we're gonna use this guy.
[02:26:09.087 --> 02:26:12.389]  And so that undercuts people who want to work.
[02:26:12.429 --> 02:26:20.273]  And so then what happens is someone who wants to work gets on government welfare, gets an opioid addiction, and before you know it, they're dead.
[02:26:20.413 --> 02:26:22.454]  I have one friend who's lost 16 friends
[02:26:23.795 --> 02:26:25.437]  Oh my God, that's another thing.
[02:26:25.557 --> 02:26:29.100]  Don't just think eight years ago Obama magically waved a wand.
[02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:29.540]  He did.
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:37.387]  I literally, half the people I know are addicted to opioids outside this office or have dead family.
[02:26:37.467 --> 02:26:44.213]  I mean, it's the doctors are just handing out... Did you hear the FDA just approved a new opioid a hundred times stronger than heroin?
[02:26:44.654 --> 02:26:46.796]  Like, execute whoever invented that!
[02:26:47.921 --> 02:26:57.989]  Yeah, and it's because of the spiritual and emotional rot that's happening in this country that's coming from a lack of purpose, lack of family, lack of ability to buy your first home.
[02:26:58.349 --> 02:27:12.439]  Because a two-bedroom, tiny house, you know, my parents' house that they got for $12,000, you know, now in a lot of these cities that are just overinflated by fake money and foreign money and all this stuff, you can't buy your first house.
[02:27:13.380 --> 02:27:20.624]  You know, start that family, have that hard-working job that allows you to get to the next rung and the next rung of life.
[02:27:20.684 --> 02:27:26.827]  Instead, that's all taken from people and they've now just injected their souls with opioids.
[02:27:26.907 --> 02:27:34.251]  And again, these doctors, these doctors, because I don't go to the doctors very often, and I'll be sitting there and they try to push this crap on me and I'm like, what the hell?
[02:27:34.271 --> 02:27:35.992]  I mean, this is out of control, man.
[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:37.961]  Yeah, I'm the same way.
[02:27:38.001 --> 02:27:39.162]  You know, it's like, do you have pain?
[02:27:39.262 --> 02:27:40.783]  It's like, yeah, you know, I'm really tall.
[02:27:40.803 --> 02:27:41.804]  My back hurts a lot.
[02:27:42.164 --> 02:27:51.512]  But it's like they're always trying to get you to get in that system because once you're in, you know, it's just like what you were talking about with that with the illegal aliens.
[02:27:51.572 --> 02:27:53.073]  It's like someone's skimming.
[02:27:53.133 --> 02:27:55.435]  Someone's taking a percentage of every pill sold.
[02:27:55.955 --> 02:27:58.938]  And, you know, it doesn't a lot of these wars are
[02:27:59.558 --> 02:28:02.800]  A big element of it is controlling opium and poppies.
[02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:03.221]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28:03.241 --> 02:28:07.724]  I mean, my dad managed over a hundred different medical facilities at one time, usually about 30 or 40.
[02:28:08.404 --> 02:28:17.350]  And I know the whole inside, but they would send the most gorgeous drug reps who, and he never did this, but was well known, who would have sex with people that would just do a certain amount of scripts.
[02:28:17.810 --> 02:28:20.452]  It wasn't just trips to Cancun or trips to Tahiti.
[02:28:20.472 --> 02:28:27.377]  I mean, they'll send the hottest chicks you've ever seen to have sex with you in your office if you get as many prescriptions out as they want.
[02:28:27.537 --> 02:28:28.938]  Because they're drug dealers, of course!
[02:28:30.039 --> 02:28:34.542]  Like one time I was in this office, I saw this chick walking by and I was like, this is the most beautiful woman I ever saw.
[02:28:34.623 --> 02:28:36.584]  And she's like laughing and goes to the door of this other doctor.
[02:28:36.604 --> 02:28:42.549]  I went over to my dad's office, I was just visiting the doctor and I'm like, Jesus, the hottest women in the country, folks, are drug reps.
[02:28:43.030 --> 02:28:44.231]  And they're just in there.
[02:28:45.171 --> 02:28:45.992]  It's just sick.
[02:28:46.132 --> 02:28:46.853]  Oh my God.
[02:28:46.913 --> 02:28:48.134]  Owen Benjamin's our guest.
[02:28:48.654 --> 02:28:51.277]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWorks.com, Infowars.com.
[02:28:51.297 --> 02:28:52.858]  Tomorrow's news today, what are we?
[02:28:56.494 --> 02:28:57.196]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:28:57.276 --> 02:29:00.843]  I mean, I'm not gonna pitch opium on people, but I mean, I don't know, this chick comes in, I might do it.
[02:29:02.667 --> 02:29:04.230]  You know that guy Alex Jones?
[02:29:04.891 --> 02:29:06.034]  The Infowars guy?
[02:29:06.943 --> 02:29:07.863]  You know who I'm talking about?
[02:29:08.224 --> 02:29:10.645]  The guy with no lips, that f***ing lunatic.
[02:29:10.985 --> 02:29:16.267]  They removed all his content from Facebook, iTunes, Pinterest, and YouTube.
[02:29:16.647 --> 02:29:17.348]  Good, you f***er.
[02:29:17.768 --> 02:29:19.609]  You know the piece of s*** I'm talking about, right?
[02:29:19.929 --> 02:29:20.689]  Alex Jones.
[02:29:21.049 --> 02:29:22.770]  You know which piece of s*** I'm talking about?
[02:29:22.930 --> 02:29:24.191]  Alex f***ing Jones.
[02:29:24.591 --> 02:29:25.171]  You know, right?
[02:29:25.431 --> 02:29:27.452]  They shut you down, you f***er.
[02:29:28.012 --> 02:29:28.313]  Good.
[02:29:28.593 --> 02:29:30.934]  No freedom of speech for you, you piece of s***.
[02:29:31.634 --> 02:29:33.335]  Good, you f***ing lunatic!
[02:29:33.835 --> 02:29:34.155]  Good!
[02:29:34.616 --> 02:29:35.756]  Bye-bye, f***o!
[02:29:35.816 --> 02:29:40.219]  Tech companies are taking the lead and suppressing any voices that dissent against the left.
[02:29:40.279 --> 02:29:45.722]  Conservatives are feeling the heavy hand of censorship in the United States and across Western Europe.
[02:29:45.962 --> 02:29:48.303]  Twitter gives Alex Jones the boot.
[02:29:48.363 --> 02:29:52.565]  I have a right to face my accusers, Jack, and I never threatened the media with battle rifles.
[02:29:52.605 --> 02:29:54.746]  All the top searches are lies about me and my family.
[02:29:54.806 --> 02:29:59.829]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[02:30:00.009 --> 02:30:01.350]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[02:30:01.370 --> 02:30:02.930]  I have a right to face my accusers.
[02:30:03.371 --> 02:30:05.772]  And you, Congressman Deutch, are a liar and a fraud.
[02:30:05.832 --> 02:30:11.014]  Infowars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[02:30:11.074 --> 02:30:12.214]  Google is evil!
[02:30:12.595 --> 02:30:13.635]  Google is evil!
[02:30:13.675 --> 02:30:15.256]  We're aware of his lying to Congress.
[02:30:15.276 --> 02:30:19.638]  We're aware of him and the Dragonfly Project that's already been operational for years inside the Chinese government.
[02:30:19.918 --> 02:30:21.379]  Now it's just being rolled out to the general public.
[02:30:21.399 --> 02:30:26.141]  There is an absolute all-out war on conservative free speech.
[02:30:30.604 --> 02:30:35.688]  Facebook and Twitter are under fire as conservative users are speaking out about being censored on their platform.
[02:30:35.768 --> 02:30:38.790]  Alex Jones was banned by every major social network.
[02:30:38.830 --> 02:30:45.834]  In the past few days, Apple, Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, and other companies have all banned Alex Jones from using their platforms.
[02:30:45.874 --> 02:30:47.856]  He's been shadow banned by Google.
[02:30:47.996 --> 02:30:50.117]  Milo Yiannopoulos was banned by Twitter.
[02:30:50.137 --> 02:30:53.560]  I don't know if you know about this, but Milo Yiannopoulos, you know who he is?
[02:30:53.620 --> 02:30:56.942]  He got banned from Twitter for writing a bad review about Ghostbusters.
[02:30:57.142 --> 02:30:58.884]  This guy is a threat to the Republic.
[02:30:58.944 --> 02:31:07.431]  British anti-Islamization activist Tommy Robinson has had his Twitter account suspended again after he tweeted that Islam promotes killing.
[02:31:07.551 --> 02:31:10.553]  Also, Twitter purged various libertarian accounts.
[02:31:11.014 --> 02:31:13.376]  Instagram temporarily banned Tommy Robinson.
[02:31:13.756 --> 02:31:17.819]  Facebook took down a GOP candidate's ads for allegedly being offensive.
[02:31:17.899 --> 02:31:21.823]  The FCC is cracking down on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:31:21.923 --> 02:31:23.764]  They're coming for everyone's speech.
[02:31:23.904 --> 02:31:24.425]  It's criminal.
[02:31:24.605 --> 02:31:30.927]  Their social media accounts are being banned, blocked, and canceled on Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook.
[02:31:30.987 --> 02:31:32.968]  Facebook censored our free speech.
[02:31:33.228 --> 02:31:37.709]  Twitter this evening has suspended the account of Gavin McInnes.
[02:31:37.949 --> 02:31:42.591]  And shame on the ones that don't even see that we have been censored.
[02:31:42.611 --> 02:31:45.792]  We were caught on tape by Project Veritas shadowbanning people.
[02:31:46.272 --> 02:31:47.313]  You are censoring people.
[02:31:47.353 --> 02:31:48.093]  You censored me.
[02:31:48.113 --> 02:31:49.174]  You censored Milo.
[02:31:49.214 --> 02:31:50.475]  You censored Chuck Johnson.
[02:31:50.535 --> 02:31:51.456]  James O'Keefe.
[02:31:51.496 --> 02:31:55.698]  You even censored President Trump when one of your employees deleted his account for a few minutes.
[02:31:55.758 --> 02:31:57.139]  You are censoring conservatives.
[02:31:57.179 --> 02:31:59.801]  And I'm asking you, President Donald Trump, help us.
[02:31:59.981 --> 02:32:02.743]  Please help us, Mr. President, before it is too late.
[02:32:02.823 --> 02:32:04.844]  Facebook is censoring free speech.
[02:32:04.904 --> 02:32:06.565]  They're making and changing the rules.
[02:32:06.605 --> 02:32:08.166]  Reverend Graham was banned for over 24 hours.
[02:32:09.107 --> 02:32:15.391]  I had this platform, and that was my main platform for communicating with people and sending out my content, and now I can't communicate.
[02:32:15.451 --> 02:32:16.311]  I've been silenced.
[02:32:16.351 --> 02:32:23.335]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadowbanning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives.
[02:32:23.435 --> 02:32:29.259]  Authorities in Britain now seem more interested in fighting hate speech on the internet than fighting crime.
[02:32:29.799 --> 02:32:34.001]  They're warning social media users that their comments are being monitored.
[02:32:34.081 --> 02:32:42.526]  I'm more upset that some people in Silicon Valley, in secret, determined which ideas are allowed on my social media feed.
[02:32:42.546 --> 02:32:51.671]  And so we just sit here and just endure the greatest censorship in the history of America, and the left, which claims to be for free speech, applauds it.
[02:32:51.831 --> 02:32:58.555]  No freedom of speech for you, you piece of sh- If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:06.412 --> 02:33:10.516]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.065 --> 02:33:27.029]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.887 --> 02:33:45.217]  So, literally during this last three and a half minute break, I'm back there getting some more coffee, and we've got CNN and Fox News on.
[02:33:45.657 --> 02:33:48.320]  And I see a Humira drug ad we're about to play.
[02:33:48.340 --> 02:33:49.060]  Talk about wizardry.
[02:33:49.341 --> 02:33:52.103]  This is a non-opioid painkiller.
[02:33:52.123 --> 02:33:53.625]  So I'm like, okay, great, let me watch it.
[02:33:54.721 --> 02:34:03.767]  And you talk about wizardry, because it shows the most wonderful images of having tea, and kids playing, and kites, and it's meanwhile this will cause heart attacks, death, everything else.
[02:34:04.187 --> 02:34:06.609]  And it's like, is this like unintentional comedy?
[02:34:06.629 --> 02:34:09.291]  Because under law, they've got to tell you what it can do to you.
[02:34:10.151 --> 02:34:11.572]  Except vaccine ads.
[02:34:12.192 --> 02:34:15.394]  They say get your flu shot at the Golden Globes or at an ad.
[02:34:15.834 --> 02:34:17.775]  They always say safe and effective, no side effects.
[02:34:18.255 --> 02:34:20.116]  The sheet says, can kill you.
[02:34:20.776 --> 02:34:22.717]  Can cause Guillain-Barré Neurological Disorders.
[02:34:22.737 --> 02:34:25.138]  But see, a national emergency was declared.
[02:34:26.619 --> 02:34:27.780]  And Reagan got tricked into this.
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:29.500]  Reagan wasn't a bad guy, but this was bad.
[02:34:31.421 --> 02:34:34.603]  To give it liability protection under national emergency.
[02:34:35.711 --> 02:34:37.212]  So that's a bad national emergency.
[02:34:37.392 --> 02:34:39.953]  But again, they're the Golden Globes.
[02:34:39.973 --> 02:34:41.954]  They weren't taking real vaccines.
[02:34:43.015 --> 02:34:44.575]  And again, I know vaccines are real technology.
[02:34:44.615 --> 02:34:47.337]  The problem is they contain it, obviously, and they've been caught doing it.
[02:34:47.917 --> 02:34:54.680]  But these huge hypodermic needles engage, there's William Dafoe, your TV viewer, with a fake vaccine.
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:35:03.405]  So this is how sick it's gotten with, get your flu shot, even though it admits it doubles your chances of getting flu, lowers your immunity, all this crap.
[02:35:04.301 --> 02:35:07.744]  This is what Entertainment's turned into, and it's the very same piece.
[02:35:08.284 --> 02:35:13.468]  Right after they did that, they have one of the winners come on and say, I hate walls, they're immoral!
[02:35:13.488 --> 02:35:19.633]  Well, they have a wall around it, and checkpoints, and drug dogs, and guys with machine guns, just like Nancy Pelosi and the rest of it.
[02:35:19.673 --> 02:35:25.738]  So, I want to get Owen Benjamin's take on this about, I don't think the wizardry's working anymore.
[02:35:26.789 --> 02:35:27.549]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[02:35:27.589 --> 02:35:28.530]  It's working on some people.
[02:35:28.570 --> 02:35:30.090]  But where do you think it's going to end?
[02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:31.511]  And what do you think of drug ads?
[02:35:31.571 --> 02:35:34.192]  Because they juxtapose the most happy things.
[02:35:34.232 --> 02:35:36.293]  They go, heart failure, cancer, death.
[02:35:36.633 --> 02:35:38.914]  It's kids going, yay!
[02:35:39.014 --> 02:35:39.694]  What is that?
[02:35:39.954 --> 02:35:48.878]  Because there's nothing more mind control feeling, like I'm in Clockwork Orange in the theater with them dripping stuff in my eyes, than when I'm watching these drug ads.
[02:35:49.781 --> 02:35:59.467]  Yeah, I think the wizardry that they're working on now is creating a world where people are capable of staying in a constant state of cognitive dissonance.
[02:35:59.847 --> 02:36:12.735]  Like what you were just talking about, because as a comedian I'm seeing it everywhere now, because a lot of comedy is based on juxtaposition where hot, cold, bright, dark, and you put it together and it makes people laugh.
[02:36:13.596 --> 02:36:26.407]  And so now I'm watching this stuff and it's comedic in a very tragic and insane way to someone who can see through it, but unfortunately there's a lot of people that can't see through it.
[02:36:26.467 --> 02:36:31.572]  And as a musician, you know, it's the same chords and sitting on the dock of the bay as Creep by Radiohead because
[02:36:32.112 --> 02:36:39.056]  Those chords make you feel isolation, and they make you feel like a weirdo sitting alone on a dock of a bay, right?
[02:36:39.116 --> 02:36:45.540]  So in music, you have the chord progression makes your emotions feel something, and then the words are the logos.
[02:36:46.140 --> 02:36:51.543]  And so with that contradiction, I know this sounds kind of crazy, but if you really think about it, it's true.
[02:36:52.063 --> 02:37:06.507]  With that contradiction, just like in the commercials, you know, you see the dog, you see the couple, you see the nice spread of breakfast, the sun coming up, and as you're watching that, it's telling you that it's poison.
[02:37:06.807 --> 02:37:12.749]  Oh, he's giving the dog water, but then he looks at the dog psychotically, and may cause death.
[02:37:13.749 --> 02:37:23.492]  But it's okay, water, like they're associating water and nurturing with death, ah, feed your puppy, death, death, it's like some weird, like in hell, this is what the devil would show you.
[02:37:24.552 --> 02:37:34.055]  Right, oh yeah, yeah, because you can't even, yeah, in hell, that's a great way to put it, where it's like in hell you can't even identify what is good or bad, and I think that that
[02:37:34.719 --> 02:37:43.683]  You know, like, when a bear is hunting fish, they make the water as muddy as possible so the fish doesn't know up or down, and then the bear can just eat as many fish as he wants.
[02:37:43.703 --> 02:37:44.123]  Well, that's it.
[02:37:44.143 --> 02:37:46.805]  It's just total confusion, like, murder, death, it's gonna kill you.
[02:37:47.105 --> 02:37:48.906]  Oh, look, your grandchildren, so loving.
[02:37:49.186 --> 02:37:52.947]  Here, for radio listeners, you'll hear the audio, which is totally frightening.
[02:37:53.388 --> 02:37:57.730]  But then, with the video, it's this juxtapose to try to trick your brain.
[02:37:57.770 --> 02:37:58.090]  Here it is.
[02:38:00.848 --> 02:38:01.549]  We don't have it?
[02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:03.590]  I thought I had it queued up.
[02:38:03.630 --> 02:38:05.712]  Well, go online and pull up a Humira ad then.
[02:38:06.573 --> 02:38:07.193]  We're backing it up.
[02:38:07.213 --> 02:38:07.834]  We'll have it in a minute.
[02:38:08.314 --> 02:38:13.378]  So, what's up with these corporations and these people that are willing to do all this?
[02:38:13.458 --> 02:38:20.344]  Because I met probably 18, 19 years ago with a guy that owned a bunch of radio stations in Minnesota.
[02:38:20.384 --> 02:38:20.885]  He's dead now.
[02:38:22.082 --> 02:38:31.015]  And he was a psychiatrist, and he had been hired when he was younger to work for the government in propaganda and subliminals, but it was like for what they were doing and they thought it was good.
[02:38:31.035 --> 02:38:37.945]  And he said, listen, the stuff they're subliminally putting in Smurf cereal ads was his example.
[02:38:38.766 --> 02:38:51.108]  Or whatever he said is absolutely designed to screw up young boys and the whole program is to destroy boys and it's totally evil and he was saying it's meant to make a bunch of you know cock you know what sucker and say it.
[02:38:51.429 --> 02:38:52.889]  I mean he was saying all this stuff.
[02:38:52.969 --> 02:38:53.909]  I didn't say all that but delay it.
[02:38:55.389 --> 02:38:59.170]  And and and then I'm like okay yeah and I was like to Ted Anderson meet with this guy.
[02:38:59.190 --> 02:39:01.971]  I'm like I know this guy's this and that but that's kind of perverted he's talking about this.
[02:39:02.611 --> 02:39:08.032]  Now the American Psychological Association came out and said men existing is bad and is a mental illness.
[02:39:09.019 --> 02:39:12.360]  So, I looked this guy up later.
[02:39:12.420 --> 02:39:14.620]  He was involved probably, you know, MKUltra.
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:16.720]  I mean, he was a high-level government psychiatrist.
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:23.502]  He was ranting at a two-hour lunch, he did put me on a few of the stations, about, you gotta cover how they want to destroy boys.
[02:39:23.562 --> 02:39:25.042]  Listen, Alex, I'm a liberal.
[02:39:25.402 --> 02:39:26.242]  I believe in freedom.
[02:39:26.262 --> 02:39:27.362]  This isn't liberal.
[02:39:27.382 --> 02:39:31.323]  This is a total war to destroy society and a plan to end the family and blah, blah, blah.
[02:39:31.523 --> 02:39:35.764]  This is some rich psychiatrist that had all these government weapons contracts and, you know, mind control.
[02:39:36.304 --> 02:39:39.765]  And he's telling me this evil plan, and now I'm here and it's happened!
[02:39:40.066 --> 02:39:41.566]  It's like, who comes up with this?
[02:39:42.807 --> 02:39:46.268]  Well, it's not about money at that level, it's about control.
[02:39:46.468 --> 02:39:49.569]  And if you want control, the first thing you have to do is get rid of men.
[02:39:49.969 --> 02:39:58.492]  You have to get, because the males of a population, the males of a country, are the ones that keep the monsters at bay.
[02:39:58.532 --> 02:40:02.094]  You know, that's a man's job, is to provide, protect, and to teach.
[02:40:02.774 --> 02:40:17.138]  And so, if you make the men women, or if you make the men self-hating, or if you make the men these blobs, then any enemy can come in and take control of the children, the women, the resources, the geography, all of it.
[02:40:17.158 --> 02:40:20.319]  Well, that's the first thing any Atilla the Hun or anybody does is they kill the men.
[02:40:20.339 --> 02:40:20.719]  You're right.
[02:40:20.999 --> 02:40:22.479]  We have the Humira ad now.
[02:40:22.759 --> 02:40:25.000]  So let's go ahead and roll and get Owen Benjamin's take on this.
[02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:26.280]  Joyboys!
[02:40:26.420 --> 02:40:29.522]  Ongoing pain and stiffness are signs of joint erosion.
[02:40:30.002 --> 02:40:32.123]  Humira can help stop the clock.
[02:40:32.183 --> 02:40:39.127]  Prescribed for 15 years, Humira targets and blocks a source of inflammation that contributes to joint pain and irreversible damage.
[02:40:39.967 --> 02:40:42.248]  Humira can lower your ability to fight infections.
[02:40:42.708 --> 02:40:50.372]  Serious and sometimes fatal infections including tuberculosis and cancers including lymphoma have happened, as have blood, liver and nervous system problems.
[02:40:50.992 --> 02:40:53.754]  Serious allergic reactions and new or worsening heart failure.
[02:40:54.534 --> 02:41:03.021]  Tell your doctor if you've been to areas where certain fungal infections are common, and if you've had TB, hepatitis B, are prone to infections, or have flu-like symptoms or sores.
[02:41:03.842 --> 02:41:05.764]  Don't start Humira if you have an infection.
[02:41:07.225 --> 02:41:10.347]  Help stop the clock on further irreversible joint damage.
[02:41:11.468 --> 02:41:12.790]  Talk to your rheumatologist.
[02:41:13.795 --> 02:41:15.117]  Right here, right now.
[02:41:15.257 --> 02:41:15.918]  Humira.
[02:41:16.198 --> 02:41:17.900]  Your immune system often die of cancer.
[02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:19.261]  And I'm not even picking on Humira.
[02:41:19.321 --> 02:41:20.783]  It's light on the spectrum.
[02:41:20.803 --> 02:41:23.546]  But this is just, these ads are insane.
[02:41:23.606 --> 02:41:26.229]  All these happy images of moms and kids with frisbees.
[02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:27.531]  Oh, it's gonna kill you.
[02:41:27.551 --> 02:41:30.454]  And of course, if you really go to the doctor, they don't ask if you have an infection.
[02:41:30.654 --> 02:41:31.816]  They don't ask what other drugs you're on.
[02:41:32.865 --> 02:41:34.825]  Can I point out some wizardry in that?
[02:41:35.406 --> 02:41:41.407]  It's funny how when they're trying to push this stuff, they use images of strong gender roles.
[02:41:41.467 --> 02:41:48.788]  Where you have a man with a beard and a dog in a jeep wearing plaid and a woman just kind of like loving the guy.
[02:41:48.968 --> 02:41:50.809]  Because that's what people deep down want.
[02:41:50.849 --> 02:41:51.929]  They want gender roles.
[02:41:51.949 --> 02:41:54.810]  They want a woman... You can get mom an apple pie.
[02:41:54.870 --> 02:41:56.850]  Just take this and turn your immune system off.
[02:41:57.498 --> 02:41:58.259]  Right, exactly.
[02:41:58.279 --> 02:41:59.860]  Like women want to have children.
[02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:00.941]  They want grandchildren.
[02:42:00.961 --> 02:42:04.565]  They want to be surrounded by the home that they've made with a strong male.
[02:42:04.965 --> 02:42:09.870]  And so they gave you these images while at the same time, they're like, take these pills to make you die.
[02:42:11.192 --> 02:42:30.954]  And so people are manipulated by what they want out of life and what everybody wants that like women want a strong male in their life and men want a family that they can fight for and provide for and then like they'll show you these images and then but they subvert the entire population by then giving you poison.
[02:42:31.983 --> 02:42:34.625]  And in TA61138, that's based on a real U.N.
[02:42:34.685 --> 02:42:41.590]  plan, Huxley admitted that, and it got made into a film by George Lucas and adapted.
[02:42:41.650 --> 02:42:50.637]  But they said, we're going to take what women want, children, and we're going to basically make managing the state their child, and the husband will be the state.
[02:42:51.298 --> 02:42:52.459]  And now they've done it.
[02:42:53.319 --> 02:42:53.900]  What's wrong?
[02:42:54.020 --> 02:42:54.500]  What's wrong?
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:56.442]  We have criminal drug evasion.
[02:42:57.022 --> 02:42:58.723]  We'll be right back with Owen Benjamin.
[02:42:58.763 --> 02:42:59.404]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:43:03.848 --> 02:43:04.969]  We built the modern world.
[02:43:05.609 --> 02:43:06.950]  We built the modern world.
[02:43:07.030 --> 02:43:07.551]  Who?
[02:43:07.671 --> 02:43:08.351]  Europeans.
[02:43:08.532 --> 02:43:09.112]  Europeans?
[02:43:09.172 --> 02:43:12.315]  We invented science and industry.
[02:43:12.495 --> 02:43:19.740]  We invented science and industry and you want to tell us to stop because oh my god we're so bad.
[02:43:19.820 --> 02:43:22.342]  We invented the modern world.
[02:43:22.362 --> 02:43:23.923]  I feel you.
[02:43:24.064 --> 02:43:27.326]  You're so dumb.
[02:43:27.366 --> 02:43:30.288]  We saved billions of people from starvation.
[02:43:30.348 --> 02:43:30.469]  Who?
[02:43:31.209 --> 02:43:34.192]  We built modern civilization.
[02:43:34.232 --> 02:43:37.514]  White people are the best thing that ever happened to the world.
[02:43:37.594 --> 02:43:39.376]  We are so amazing!
[02:43:39.536 --> 02:43:40.777]  I love myself!
[02:43:40.857 --> 02:43:42.999]  And I love white people!
[02:43:43.079 --> 02:43:44.980]  Yeah, white people!
[02:43:45.020 --> 02:43:46.561]  Yeah, white men!
[02:43:46.962 --> 02:43:47.943]  We're white men!
[02:43:48.263 --> 02:43:49.664]  We did everything!
[02:43:49.724 --> 02:43:52.406]  Look, I don't hate other people.
[02:43:52.466 --> 02:43:54.948]  I just love my white men.
[02:43:54.968 --> 02:43:55.869]  I just love white men.
[02:43:56.169 --> 02:43:59.131]  So joining us is Julian Von Aboulaye.
[02:43:59.291 --> 02:44:06.056]  And I want to talk about all this with him because he's been doxxed by SJWs and they are calling for his head for what you just saw.
[02:44:06.236 --> 02:44:09.959]  And people also basically grabbed his face, you know, basically assaulted him.
[02:44:10.219 --> 02:44:16.023]  That's being praised as well because to say that white people aren't inherently evil is now a thought crime.
[02:44:16.303 --> 02:44:17.504]  So Julian, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:44:17.924 --> 02:44:26.610]  What I said in the video, what I really meant was essentially that Western civilization is the greatest society that has ever existed, and I'm not going to back down from saying that.
[02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:34.555]  We're basically the first society to understand the human individual as a person, as a human being, to allow for free expression, okay?
[02:44:34.635 --> 02:44:39.238]  We're the civilization that created the most technologically advanced culture in human history.
[02:44:40.038 --> 02:44:44.421]  And the basic principles of our society are under attack.
[02:44:44.541 --> 02:44:47.984]  And I'm done putting up with our society being under attack.
[02:44:48.084 --> 02:44:50.866]  The West was the first society to end slavery.
[02:44:50.946 --> 02:44:54.949]  The West was the first society to create equal legal rights for all people.
[02:44:55.029 --> 02:45:03.475]  The West was the first society that essentially viewed individuals as individuals and not as part of some social or racial group.
[02:45:03.675 --> 02:45:09.299]  I think it's completely ironic that Western civilization is attacked
[02:45:10.541 --> 02:45:16.125]  For being a civilization that hurts people and for being a civilization that puts people down.
[02:45:16.525 --> 02:45:17.285]  Because you know what?
[02:45:17.686 --> 02:45:27.032]  Western civilization has created the greatest living standards and the most peace and the most opportunity for the most people of any society in history.
[02:45:27.512 --> 02:45:39.776]  And I think it's time that we start to stand up for our values as a society when we're under constant attack by a system that wants to bring down the basic principles of our civilization.
[02:45:39.896 --> 02:45:41.976]  I mean, that's how I feel as a person.
[02:45:42.417 --> 02:45:50.419]  I feel like my identity is under attack, and I feel like the values of the greatest society in history, the society in which I live, are under attack.
[02:45:50.439 --> 02:45:52.400]  And I'm not going to succumb to conformity.
[02:45:52.420 --> 02:45:55.781]  I'm not going to succumb to a system that wants to put us down.
[02:45:56.001 --> 02:45:57.181]  I'm going to stand up for
[02:45:57.261 --> 02:45:58.762]  Good, and I hope you do too.
[02:46:06.228 --> 02:46:10.192]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:46:11.897 --> 02:46:14.920]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:17.062]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:46:17.702 --> 02:46:21.526]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:46:22.007 --> 02:46:29.393]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:46:29.493 --> 02:46:31.916]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[02:46:35.330 --> 02:46:37.191]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:46:37.211 --> 02:46:40.733]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[02:46:40.993 --> 02:46:51.718]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:46:53.959 --> 02:46:56.980]  Never miss your show, any day.
[02:46:57.061 --> 02:46:58.181]  I mean, never.
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:11.922]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.263 --> 02:47:30.308]  By the way, Owen Benjamin,
[02:47:31.351 --> 02:47:37.315]  You know, he says he's a comedian, but like he said, his dad was in rhetoric, his mom, children books, so he understands communication.
[02:47:39.717 --> 02:47:41.599]  And so we tend to always get into the attack on the family.
[02:47:42.719 --> 02:47:45.421]  I want to say something here that's not profound.
[02:47:46.122 --> 02:47:46.802]  It's basic.
[02:47:47.563 --> 02:47:48.724]  But that is profound.
[02:47:49.204 --> 02:47:50.605]  I don't mean to be contradictory.
[02:47:51.065 --> 02:47:55.369]  It's super ultra profound, but it's like saying we need oxygen to live.
[02:47:56.291 --> 02:48:05.255]  You know, I've been told by FDA, former FDA prosecutors, don't say you'll die without vitamin C. Or the FDA will shut you down.
[02:48:05.995 --> 02:48:10.117]  Well, you will die without vitamin C. It's like saying you'll die without air.
[02:48:10.157 --> 02:48:12.458]  You'll die without air in four minutes, on average.
[02:48:13.078 --> 02:48:16.279]  You'll die without water in about four days, without food in about 30.
[02:48:16.799 --> 02:48:17.740]  Now, these are facts.
[02:48:19.875 --> 02:48:29.802]  But again, they're telling you, you can't, the wizards, make any comments, you're bad selling supplements, but oh, we can sell you all these deadly drugs on TV.
[02:48:31.764 --> 02:48:39.530]  So we keep going back to the attack on the family, and it's a fact that men and women are the species.
[02:48:40.250 --> 02:48:44.894]  There's not a separation, men are men, women are women, but we are the species, like every other species.
[02:48:44.974 --> 02:48:49.077]  It's such a joke to try to turn women against men, men against women,
[02:48:50.271 --> 02:49:02.143]  And to then have the American Psychological Association, I'm going to play the Ingram clip here in a moment, come out and openly say masculinity, period, is toxic and evil and bad.
[02:49:02.163 --> 02:49:11.073]  Well, that's been the goal to wage war on the boys because the hyper evil sociopaths and psychopaths who
[02:49:12.679 --> 02:49:13.060]  I don't
[02:49:28.340 --> 02:49:30.722]  Questing after power to dominate everything.
[02:49:31.002 --> 02:49:39.069]  A real alpha male wants to build other alpha males and other powerful females and build an incredible future and sits back and looks at the success that they've gained reaction.
[02:49:39.089 --> 02:49:45.053]  Like the Marine Corps wants to see, you know, people after boot camp more powerful than they were.
[02:49:45.554 --> 02:49:48.196]  It's not like you look down at creating a new group of people more powerful.
[02:49:48.216 --> 02:49:49.717]  You go, I am freaking powerful.
[02:49:50.017 --> 02:49:51.058]  I just turned that loose.
[02:49:51.318 --> 02:49:52.239]  See, you understand?
[02:49:52.379 --> 02:49:53.280]  I'm living through you.
[02:49:53.320 --> 02:49:53.940]  You're living through me.
[02:49:54.961 --> 02:50:00.482]  And my ancestors, they believed I was going to dominate for humanity, not dominate just for me personally.
[02:50:01.883 --> 02:50:06.684]  And so that's the huge existential issue here is they're openly saying it.
[02:50:06.804 --> 02:50:12.145]  I can't pick a newspaper up or a magazine or turn TV on like, men are the problem and masculinity is the problem.
[02:50:12.165 --> 02:50:13.405]  It's so out.
[02:50:13.486 --> 02:50:14.586]  And then we're like, you're right.
[02:50:14.626 --> 02:50:15.106]  We're sorry.
[02:50:15.146 --> 02:50:16.146]  Women be nice to us.
[02:50:16.186 --> 02:50:17.166]  We'll do whatever you want.
[02:50:17.186 --> 02:50:21.307]  Because the state, as Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children.
[02:50:21.347 --> 02:50:22.048]  So follow the men.
[02:50:22.348 --> 02:50:23.188]  That's Joseph Goebbels.
[02:50:24.150 --> 02:50:27.472]  So here's Laura Ingraham, who they are celebrating has been taken off the radio.
[02:50:27.732 --> 02:50:30.234]  We got her sponsors and let's get her off Fox.
[02:50:30.274 --> 02:50:34.156]  Here's a woman saying, I'm not more wealthy if men are a bunch of wimps.
[02:50:35.216 --> 02:50:36.977]  That's a powerful woman.
[02:50:37.938 --> 02:50:38.918]  I mean, like my grandmothers.
[02:50:41.660 --> 02:50:46.243]  And it's not like I'm like virtue selling to women about their powerful role.
[02:50:47.572 --> 02:50:54.056]  Any real women know that and understand what it is, and it's just so sick to see everybody having their birthrights stolen.
[02:50:54.076 --> 02:51:02.842]  But here it is, the American Psychological Association that runs your schools, that runs policy, that runs the UN UNESCO program, they are now admitting what's been in their textbooks for decades.
[02:51:03.182 --> 02:51:04.563]  We want to end men.
[02:51:04.583 --> 02:51:05.784]  Well, that means end everything.
[02:51:05.824 --> 02:51:06.144]  Here it is.
[02:51:07.984 --> 02:51:12.067]  Well, James Bond's masculinity has apparently hit its expiration date.
[02:51:12.087 --> 02:51:12.768]  Can you believe it?
[02:51:12.808 --> 02:51:13.168]  Get this.
[02:51:13.208 --> 02:51:22.416]  The American Psychological Association is now out with new guidelines declaring that, quote, traditional masculinity is harmful.
[02:51:23.077 --> 02:51:30.963]  Ryan McDermott, a psychologist at the University of South Alabama who helped draft these guidelines, asks unironically,
[02:51:31.804 --> 02:51:33.207]  What is gender in the 2010s?
[02:51:33.227 --> 02:51:34.730]  Look at that soy boy.
[02:51:34.830 --> 02:51:37.395]  It's no longer just this male-female binary.
[02:51:37.997 --> 02:51:40.942]  If we can change men, we can change the world.
[02:51:42.384 --> 02:51:44.626]  What exactly are we trying to change them to?
[02:51:44.726 --> 02:51:49.051]  Well, do modern women really dislike traditional masculinity?
[02:51:49.391 --> 02:51:57.480]  Here to help us answer all this is Emily Jasinski, Senior Culture Editor at The Federalist and radio talk show host, Jamila A. Alright, Emily, let's start with you.
[02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:02.886]  What do you think this kind of attack on what is known as traditional masculinity is all about?
[02:52:03.126 --> 02:52:24.234]  Yes, so the APA specifically names, in their definition of traditional masculinity, competitiveness, stoicism, all qualities that I think a lot of young women like myself and women of all ages really probably find attractive, probably find compelling, and I think it's sad that the APA lent its authority as an institution, lent its credibility as an institution
[02:52:24.654 --> 02:52:28.798]  to these guidelines, which are steeped in the language, really, of fourth-wave feminism.
[02:52:29.118 --> 02:52:42.149]  There's lots of hints at intersectionality, there's talk of privilege, there's talk of all of these different buzzwords, and there's actually a short on substance, and the substance that is there is attempting to pathologize things like... Let's stop there.
[02:52:42.670 --> 02:52:48.835]  Let me tell you what the root of this is, and I want to do five more minutes, what's the next hour, and then Paul Watson takes over, or who is it taking over today?
[02:52:48.855 --> 02:52:49.356]  Roger Stone.
[02:52:51.997 --> 02:52:52.718]  How big are you?
[02:52:53.578 --> 02:52:56.480]  Because you look like an NFL lineman.
[02:52:58.301 --> 02:52:59.622]  I'm 6'8", 275.
[02:53:00.022 --> 02:53:00.303]  Okay.
[02:53:00.803 --> 02:53:02.204]  Now, you've been here at the office.
[02:53:02.264 --> 02:53:06.547]  I'm 5'11", and I weigh, you know, 260 pounds, but you're way bigger than me.
[02:53:07.087 --> 02:53:09.909]  I don't feel insecure around you, a big, giant guy.
[02:53:09.929 --> 02:53:18.135]  I feel good, like, oh, there's a big, powerful male, and he likes me, and I like him, and he's smart, and I feel like the species is doing well.
[02:53:18.575 --> 02:53:19.556]  We've got a war machine.
[02:53:20.632 --> 02:53:27.515]  Now, the average little chicken net like Jeff Bezos, I know for a fact, he's a little backstabbing rat that hates everybody.
[02:53:27.935 --> 02:53:35.859]  And so he wants to create a system where he feels very threatened by someone who's strong, someone who speaks out, someone who takes action.
[02:53:36.459 --> 02:53:44.042]  And you know, that's what this really comes down to is, they're fundamentally creating a system where they hamstring normal competitors.
[02:53:44.082 --> 02:53:44.943]  They want a monopoly.
[02:53:44.963 --> 02:53:47.664]  They want to end competition, which ends the species, doesn't it?
[02:53:48.522 --> 02:53:54.846]  Yeah, and a lot of it is these really little guys that don't understand that we're stronger together.
[02:53:55.446 --> 02:54:05.893]  When you have guys like me and you, I could go into your studio and see this beautiful big studio, and you have a staff, and I'm like, I'm so glad I'm friends with this guy, you know?
[02:54:06.253 --> 02:54:15.759]  And that's what makes nations strong, tribes strong, families strong, and then you have these other guys... And that's it, the globalists talk about tribe all day because they don't have a sense of it.
[02:54:16.610 --> 02:54:17.250]  Right, exactly!
[02:54:17.310 --> 02:54:20.892]  Like, actual alpha males are actual strong males.
[02:54:21.253 --> 02:54:25.095]  Like, I see you as a friend, and I'm like, I'm so glad Alex is doing well.
[02:54:25.135 --> 02:54:25.935]  I'm going to support him.
[02:54:25.955 --> 02:54:34.660]  And it's the same with me with height, where sometimes, like, these little rich guys will look at me, and they'll be like, I hate him for his size.
[02:54:34.700 --> 02:54:35.981]  And I'm like, I'm too tall, dude.
[02:54:36.181 --> 02:54:37.321]  Like, I went too big.
[02:54:37.341 --> 02:54:40.163]  Like, I can't even fit on a roller coaster.
[02:54:40.743 --> 02:54:43.144]  You know, like dudes like me don't even live that long.
[02:54:43.184 --> 02:54:46.645]  It's like you go into an old folks home, you never see someone 6'7", 6'8".
[02:54:47.425 --> 02:54:50.547]  You know, we're like Great Danes, we have like seven good years, you know?
[02:54:50.967 --> 02:55:02.311]  And so like, I find it so hilarious that these little billionaire guys get so threatened and so angry of masculinity and anybody that's competitive, because no matter how much money they get,
[02:55:02.951 --> 02:55:04.272]  They still look like that.
[02:55:04.292 --> 02:55:05.032]  They still are just as weird.
[02:55:05.052 --> 02:55:08.393]  And don't they get that the strength is the strength of the species?
[02:55:08.413 --> 02:55:09.934]  Because they call themselves collectivists.
[02:55:09.954 --> 02:55:10.554]  They're the opposite.
[02:55:10.754 --> 02:55:16.636]  We're individuals, but we then join with a collective for a better future, but not a false top-down collective.
[02:55:16.656 --> 02:55:18.496]  I don't know how you describe that, but a real collective.
[02:55:19.257 --> 02:55:25.539]  Well, the collective they're trying to do, it's to make a forest equal, you use an axe.
[02:55:26.207 --> 02:55:43.462]  And so these insecure little trolls, they want to take down guys like you, guys like me, guys that, you know, work hard and want to provide value and protection and safety and stuff for their population so that they look strong when in fact they're little weasels.
[02:55:43.502 --> 02:55:53.170]  They're like, yeah, the Jeff Bezos of the world can have a golden giant palace and in the end of the day it's a weasel in a golden palace and he knows it and we know it.
[02:55:53.690 --> 02:55:59.059]  And so in the end of the day, that's why they want to get rid of masculinity, because they want to appear bigger than they are.
[02:55:59.079 --> 02:56:01.442]  Because they want to be kings, and they were never kings.
[02:56:02.532 --> 02:56:04.053]  Right, because they shouldn't be kings.
[02:56:04.573 --> 02:56:07.015]  And they shouldn't be... Like, I'm not a king.
[02:56:07.195 --> 02:56:09.976]  I'm probably a strong duke, maybe?
[02:56:09.996 --> 02:56:16.020]  You know, like, I'm... And when you know your role in the world, it makes you happy.
[02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:19.142]  And feminism is what's... Exactly.
[02:56:19.222 --> 02:56:20.983]  I'm fulfilled in my role.
[02:56:21.443 --> 02:56:24.945]  People don't know how fulfilling it is just to go with your genetic role.
[02:56:25.899 --> 02:56:26.500]  Exactly!
[02:56:26.900 --> 02:56:31.624]  And like I couldn't manage a giant studio like you have because it isn't my genetic role.
[02:56:31.644 --> 02:56:40.533]  Like my genetic role is to be by my fire and live stream from home and talk about family and do my thing and it's like I'm happy.
[02:56:40.753 --> 02:56:47.279]  Like my mom, talk about my mom again, but like and that this is and my mom has her PhD and she's a stay-at-home mom to show that
[02:56:47.899 --> 02:56:52.224]  Being a feminist doesn't mean you have to go into the salt mines and compete with dudes.
[02:56:52.244 --> 02:56:54.867]  Like, she understood that real power comes from the home.
[02:56:56.068 --> 02:57:03.236]  Well, also, powerful women realize their sons, particularly, it's those women that are behind their sons, their sons go out and conquer.
[02:57:04.117 --> 02:57:05.779]  Yeah, and then bring home safety.
[02:57:05.799 --> 02:57:09.243]  Yeah, and my mom would always say, the thing I should want in the world is enough.
[02:57:10.141 --> 02:57:17.384]  Like, the happiest people in the world are the ones that can look out at their land and their family and say, this is great.
[02:57:17.484 --> 02:57:19.005]  And then you work on that stuff.
[02:57:19.045 --> 02:57:25.407]  But this Ponzi scheme, this never-ending hole in people's hearts, is going to lead to some serious problems.
[02:57:26.248 --> 02:57:26.508]  I agree.
[02:57:26.548 --> 02:57:27.528]  Do a little more time with us.
[02:57:28.008 --> 02:57:34.131]  Because it's so archetypal to see Nancy Pelosi and Schumer looking like animatronic
[02:57:35.923 --> 02:57:50.540]  They look like like demon, you know Chucky's they look like little demon dolls or something and everyone instantly saw this within minutes the same stuff was being put out because These this this is people that literally don't know how stupid they look We'll be right back
[02:57:55.632 --> 02:57:57.633]  Ladies and gentlemen, the new year is here.
[02:57:58.134 --> 02:58:13.243]  And I personally, in the new year, am looking at all the great supplements and products at InfluenceLife.com and saying, what do I need to take religiously that I'm forgetting to take, that lowers inflammation, that empowers all the cells in the body, that makes me healthier, better stamina, libido, energy?
[02:58:13.483 --> 02:58:14.464]  And it's these three babies.
[02:58:15.304 --> 02:58:19.105]  It's Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Curcuminoid.
[02:58:19.185 --> 02:58:20.246]  Nobody else can top that.
[02:58:20.606 --> 02:58:21.666]  Top of the line in the nation.
[02:58:22.386 --> 02:58:28.208]  It's X3 that has all three of the good types of iodine together, including the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[02:58:28.708 --> 02:58:34.190]  Because some people can't absorb that type, we put a little bit of the other two types and a tiny bit of Vitamin C to stabilize it.
[02:58:34.450 --> 02:58:37.131]  And then Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[02:58:37.551 --> 02:58:41.472]  Super Male Vitality's been our overall most successful product.
[02:58:41.872 --> 02:58:44.533]  Neck and neck with Brain Force Plus.
[02:58:45.133 --> 02:58:51.295]  But because it's wildcrafted and a proprietary process, we weren't able to get it for long periods of time.
[02:58:52.236 --> 02:58:56.677]  And so I made the decision just to discontinue it and try to reformulate.
[02:58:57.118 --> 02:58:58.978]  But it's been very, very hard to do.
[02:58:59.018 --> 02:59:01.559]  So we're not discontinuing it because it's crap.
[02:59:01.679 --> 02:59:03.920]  We're discontinuing it because we can't get it.
[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:07.781]  It may come back in the future, but right now we're just not able to bring it.
[02:59:07.801 --> 02:59:09.002]  This is our last run of it.
[02:59:09.682 --> 02:59:10.343]  Proprietary.
[02:59:10.643 --> 02:59:11.084]  Amazing.
[02:59:11.344 --> 02:59:12.746]  It's at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:13.126 --> 02:59:15.649]  InfoWars4.com is the umbrella site.
[02:59:15.689 --> 02:59:18.032]  Or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:59:18.532 --> 02:59:19.033]  Bodies.
[02:59:19.653 --> 02:59:21.195]  Turmeric formula.
[02:59:21.455 --> 02:59:23.818]  And it's supercharged with other key ingredients.
[02:59:24.819 --> 02:59:25.400]  Supercharge it.
[02:59:25.420 --> 02:59:26.180]  Bring it to the next level.
[02:59:26.901 --> 02:59:28.282]  And then, of course, it's the X3.
[02:59:28.302 --> 02:59:31.204]  It's our final run of X2.
[02:59:31.264 --> 02:59:42.893]  We've secured the Deep Earth Iodine, but I thought we'd make a better one with all three types and the Vitamin C. But, so get your X2, get your X3, all at InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:59:43.133 --> 02:59:47.916]  And again, have a great New Year as we fight the globalists and restore the Republic and freedom to the planet.
[02:59:48.076 --> 02:59:48.557]  Thank you all.
[02:59:56.724 --> 03:00:03.369]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:13.978 --> 03:00:16.620]  You've got to have an ace in the hole.
[03:00:18.181 --> 03:00:20.523]  A little secret that nobody knows.
[03:00:24.337 --> 03:00:29.340]  Owen Benjamin is on fire today as he usually is and we got Roger Stone coming in about 15-20 minutes.
[03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:38.786]  We're talking about Joe Rogan in the next segment and you know I sent Joe a message that I'll tell you about in the next segment.
[03:00:38.806 --> 03:00:39.687]  It's not a mean message.
[03:00:41.408 --> 03:00:51.594]  I just said you can say whatever you want about me but if you read George Soros talking points about me on air anymore I'm gonna tell folks
[03:00:53.275 --> 03:01:01.342]  Not stuff I know from knowing you personally about 20 years, but about that damn CIA operation here in Austin.
[03:01:02.663 --> 03:01:04.965]  And that's all I'm saying.
[03:01:05.045 --> 03:01:06.506]  And it's not like some threatening thing.
[03:01:06.546 --> 03:01:09.969]  It's like, dude, you're not going to slap me around without me coming back.
[03:01:10.569 --> 03:01:11.430]  So just get ready for that.
[03:01:13.031 --> 03:01:15.273]  And you know, I almost hope he does something.
[03:01:15.293 --> 03:01:19.276]  Because I'm all sick of this faux tough guy crap all day and everything else that goes around here.
[03:01:19.296 --> 03:01:20.377]  I mean, I take on Hillary Clinton.
[03:01:20.397 --> 03:01:21.258]  I take on the globalists.
[03:01:22.253 --> 03:01:24.035]  And I'm not trying to be the biggest tough guy around here.
[03:01:24.055 --> 03:01:24.916]  I just gotta do what I gotta do.
[03:01:25.697 --> 03:01:29.721]  And it's not, well, we'll talk about it coming up.
[03:01:30.181 --> 03:01:30.962]  We'll see what happens.
[03:01:31.803 --> 03:01:34.846]  But, in fact, I just had to give him fair warning.
[03:01:35.907 --> 03:01:36.567]  And I'm gonna leave it at that.
[03:01:36.587 --> 03:01:37.629]  Now going back to Owen Benjamin.
[03:01:39.281 --> 03:01:43.486]  Where do you, the short segment we have, like four minutes, where is it going, the peak insanity?
[03:01:43.646 --> 03:01:48.912]  I get the wizards think they're manipulating us, they're manipulating some people, but they're kind of smoking their own dope.
[03:01:48.932 --> 03:01:50.714]  I mean, they're getting really far afield.
[03:01:50.734 --> 03:01:52.175]  They're acting crazier and crazier.
[03:01:52.536 --> 03:01:53.597]  Where do you see all this going?
[03:01:54.983 --> 03:02:00.389]  Well, their goal is to have a world with no borders where they get to choose who lives and dies.
[03:02:00.489 --> 03:02:04.073]  Because in the top of the pyramid, it has nothing to do with money.
[03:02:04.133 --> 03:02:08.077]  It has only to do with control of resources and the lives of people.
[03:02:08.277 --> 03:02:10.300]  Whether or not they live or die, it's all about control.
[03:02:11.301 --> 03:02:15.504]  There's a natural, biological pushback to that.
[03:02:15.524 --> 03:02:21.410]  I mean, greater people than Hillary Clinton, and I don't mean great as in good.
[03:02:21.430 --> 03:02:23.492]  You mean more aggressive, more evil?
[03:02:24.172 --> 03:02:24.993]  Right, Stalin.
[03:02:25.253 --> 03:02:27.435]  Yeah, like Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin, you know.
[03:02:27.795 --> 03:02:33.120]  People that have more amplitude and more follow-through than these people have tried and failed.
[03:02:33.140 --> 03:02:36.784]  Yeah, there have been some really evil, powerful, smart fighters, and she ain't it.
[03:02:37.685 --> 03:02:38.346]  Right, exactly.
[03:02:38.386 --> 03:02:43.771]  And there's ways that we can get past it with having a family, loving your kids.
[03:02:44.111 --> 03:02:53.800]  Like, I have an Apple laptop, and what I did when I found out some of the stuff they were doing, and I hated looking at that bitten apple because it's so biblical, I just filled it in with a marker.
[03:02:54.060 --> 03:02:57.183]  And then they don't want to give us a wall, I started building a fence.
[03:02:57.703 --> 03:02:59.146]  You know, my wife stays home.
[03:02:59.406 --> 03:03:06.277]  We had one car for a while because we couldn't afford another car, but we wanted our sons to have a mom.
[03:03:06.337 --> 03:03:10.724]  It's like these little things in our life is how we fight the big things, you know?
[03:03:10.884 --> 03:03:12.727]  And let me guess, is your wife more happy than ever?
[03:03:13.832 --> 03:03:14.192]  Oh, yeah.
[03:03:14.232 --> 03:03:14.793]  She's awesome.
[03:03:14.953 --> 03:03:15.453]  She's awesome.
[03:03:15.513 --> 03:03:35.309]  And she has her masters in engineering, and she used to briefly have to be on Zoloft because she was, like, really sad, and now she doesn't have to be on anything, and she has a very fulfilling, very just wonderful life, and she looks as beautiful as ever, and two little kids, and we're going for three, going for four, and it's the way to live.
[03:03:35.329 --> 03:03:41.414]  Well, I want to say when we come back that I just have really thought about this, and
[03:03:45.003 --> 03:03:52.831]  I can't not be quiet about the Joe Rogan situation because it's tragic and it's in our time.
[03:03:52.891 --> 03:03:54.092]  The real story has to be told.
[03:03:57.148 --> 03:04:03.534]  And then it's not fair of me to send him a text message a week ago saying, you know, you say one more damn thing off of George Soros talking point, I'm going to come after you.
[03:04:03.835 --> 03:04:04.595]  No, let's just do it.
[03:04:04.816 --> 03:04:06.577]  I think that's probably going to be better.
[03:04:06.757 --> 03:04:08.299]  And I think that's probably what needs to be done.
[03:04:08.359 --> 03:04:11.122]  It's just that I don't take any pleasure in this.
[03:04:11.522 --> 03:04:13.064]  And I just I knew it.
[03:04:13.084 --> 03:04:13.924]  I kind of knew it.
[03:04:14.525 --> 03:04:15.626]  And then I kind of ignored it.
[03:04:15.726 --> 03:04:17.248]  And it's almost like I'm guilty.
[03:04:17.448 --> 03:04:18.329]  I don't know how to explain this.
[03:04:18.829 --> 03:04:19.370]  I'm guilty.
[03:04:23.342 --> 03:04:27.465]  And this isn't about getting on the show, because I wouldn't even do it for that.
[03:04:28.386 --> 03:04:29.427]  And I realize the whole thing.
[03:04:29.447 --> 03:04:35.852]  You know, it's so bad that... God, it's... That's why I keep balking.
[03:04:36.432 --> 03:04:41.356]  It's not that I'm afraid to do it, it's like... It's so bad that I, like...
[03:04:43.396 --> 03:04:46.758]  It's kind of like cops when they get in a house and there's a bunch of dead bodies of kids and the boards.
[03:04:46.778 --> 03:04:47.699]  They don't want to pull them up.
[03:04:47.719 --> 03:04:50.160]  They know they're there because they've seen the videos the psycho did.
[03:04:50.180 --> 03:04:52.101]  Yeah, I'm going to say Joe did that.
[03:04:52.121 --> 03:04:53.322]  I'm like, Joe's a great guy.
[03:04:53.342 --> 03:04:58.445]  I'm kind of like not looking forward to pulling these boards up because, man, there are a lot of damn bodies buried right there.
[03:04:58.465 --> 03:05:00.346]  In fact, I can smell them.
[03:05:00.827 --> 03:05:01.387]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:05.302 --> 03:05:07.282]  Introducing ultimate bone broth formula.
[03:05:07.302 --> 03:05:12.123]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas we've ever offered with even better ingredients.
[03:05:12.263 --> 03:05:15.884]  Ultimate bone broth to help you save big on this new product and stock up.
[03:05:15.924 --> 03:05:18.405]  We're dropping the price to nineteen ninety five.
[03:05:18.645 --> 03:05:24.086]  Our previous supplier was unable to get the incredible ingredients while keeping the cost low.
[03:05:24.206 --> 03:05:27.066]  Since we wanted to make sure that you got the best value possible.
[03:05:27.127 --> 03:05:29.727]  We've now switched to a new supplier with even better ingredients.
[03:05:29.807 --> 03:05:32.128]  That's why it's now the ultimate bone broth formula.
[03:05:34.428 --> 03:05:42.953]  Ultimate bone broth formula include chicken bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, and alfalfa herb powder.
[03:05:43.113 --> 03:05:44.214]  And even more, of course.
[03:05:44.354 --> 03:05:53.880]  These powerful ingredients are going to help you get the most out of your workout by supporting your healthy muscles, digestion, tendons, and ligaments, while also supporting your body's fight against free radicals.
[03:05:54.160 --> 03:06:01.204]  It's time to take advantage and pick up your bottle of an updated favorite formula with ultimate bone broth from InfoWars Life.
[03:06:01.264 --> 03:06:01.665]  Thank you!
[03:06:10.865 --> 03:06:11.605]  Big Brother.
[03:06:12.005 --> 03:06:13.266]  Mainstream media.
[03:06:13.826 --> 03:06:14.906]  Government cover-ups.
[03:06:15.686 --> 03:06:17.167]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:17.407 --> 03:06:18.587]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:19.047 --> 03:06:23.208]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:23.288 --> 03:06:32.090]  You know, I'm not going to get into where the UFC money came from 20 years ago to start it up or who owns it.
[03:06:32.230 --> 03:06:34.170]  I think everybody knows that.
[03:06:42.901 --> 03:06:45.062]  I'm not going to get into any of that stuff.
[03:06:45.702 --> 03:06:47.082]  I've known Joe Rogan since 1998.
[03:06:47.442 --> 03:06:49.303]  I got to him pretty good by 99.
[03:06:50.203 --> 03:06:51.003]  He's a smart guy.
[03:06:51.063 --> 03:06:51.923]  He's a funny guy.
[03:06:52.644 --> 03:06:54.664]  But he's very shark-like.
[03:06:55.264 --> 03:06:58.225]  I'm not saying he'll screw you over unless he needs to.
[03:06:59.065 --> 03:07:04.707]  So he's not like a shark trying to just, like a scorpion, ask the toad, take him across the stream.
[03:07:05.187 --> 03:07:06.727]  And the toad says, well, you'll sting me to death.
[03:07:06.767 --> 03:07:07.648]  He says, oh, no, I promise.
[03:07:07.668 --> 03:07:08.848]  And he goes, the other side, he stings him.
[03:07:08.868 --> 03:07:09.708]  He goes, why'd you do that?
[03:07:09.748 --> 03:07:10.108]  I'm dying.
[03:07:10.148 --> 03:07:12.109]  He goes, I'm a scorpion, idiot.
[03:07:13.413 --> 03:07:14.734]  I don't think Joe Rogan's a scorpion.
[03:07:15.174 --> 03:07:20.297]  And you know, I've seen Candace Owens come on this show and get us boosted and have us connected to all the big people.
[03:07:20.417 --> 03:07:21.138]  I still promote her stuff.
[03:07:21.158 --> 03:07:21.738]  She's a good person.
[03:07:22.738 --> 03:07:28.922]  And all these other people that I get demonized, I get attacked, I'm persona non grata by the establishment so you don't come on the show.
[03:07:29.883 --> 03:07:30.223]  I get it.
[03:07:30.383 --> 03:07:31.343]  I don't need them on the show.
[03:07:31.864 --> 03:07:33.525]  But with Joe, it's a little different.
[03:07:34.522 --> 03:07:37.104]  Because I know he's super smart.
[03:07:38.084 --> 03:07:45.248]  The guy you see on air, he's got one guy that plays up to the potheads and makes them feel cool, and he's got another guy that plays up to the pseudo-intellectuals.
[03:07:45.729 --> 03:07:46.629]  Joe's very smart.
[03:07:46.649 --> 03:07:48.390]  In fact, he knows all the stuff I know.
[03:07:49.331 --> 03:07:57.036]  And then I learned about the groups that are involved, the whole sponsorship to promote DMT and psychedelics that certain groups out of San Francisco want done.
[03:07:57.056 --> 03:07:59.157]  It's kind of Timothy Leary stuff part two.
[03:07:59.217 --> 03:08:00.818]  So Joe Rogan's the new Timothy Leary.
[03:08:02.281 --> 03:08:05.865]  And you know, now that he's got such a huge show, he's been brought into all that.
[03:08:06.205 --> 03:08:06.886]  Which is great!
[03:08:07.747 --> 03:08:10.109]  I'm not one of these guys that's mad that somebody has a big show.
[03:08:11.671 --> 03:08:16.056]  My concern is when he goes, oh, I got Alex Jones on the show and set him up, made him look dumb.
[03:08:16.717 --> 03:08:17.517]  Like, I can't see that.
[03:08:17.678 --> 03:08:17.978]  And then...
[03:08:19.761 --> 03:08:24.506]  I start thinking back to what I saw, what I witnessed, the things, the groups.
[03:08:24.986 --> 03:08:27.929]  And I'm like, my God, because you know somebody, you then just ignore.
[03:08:28.650 --> 03:08:31.793]  Obviously, anything big in culture is going to have certain groups come in and try to take it over.
[03:08:33.374 --> 03:08:36.717]  And so I'm not ready to talk about all this yet.
[03:08:36.798 --> 03:08:41.602]  And I don't take any pleasure, you know, showing Joe and other people, you know, oh, I'm not stupid.
[03:08:41.622 --> 03:08:42.463]  Look what I can do to you.
[03:08:42.643 --> 03:08:43.144]  It's not that.
[03:08:44.528 --> 03:08:53.252]  It's that he perfectly read in the last year George Soros Global's talking points exactly as they were and didn't even look down.
[03:08:53.593 --> 03:08:59.235]  Because I even got the internal memos and things that Soros and Hillary and Podesta put out to the newsgroups.
[03:08:59.255 --> 03:09:02.517]  So he was getting talking points exactly as they said.
[03:09:02.817 --> 03:09:04.538]  George Soros, wow, he fought Hitler.
[03:09:04.598 --> 03:09:07.960]  He was a war hero, you know.
[03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:09.140]  Alex Jones is crazy.
[03:09:09.200 --> 03:09:11.581]  He's bullying parents of dead kids.
[03:09:11.642 --> 03:09:12.282]  None of that's true.
[03:09:13.783 --> 03:09:18.265]  And so I talked to him and I criticized him and it was when Owen Benjamin was on a few months ago and Joe calls up and he goes, listen.
[03:09:19.605 --> 03:09:20.386]  It's gotten too big.
[03:09:20.526 --> 03:09:21.366]  I want you on the show.
[03:09:21.526 --> 03:09:22.266]  Come on next month.
[03:09:22.326 --> 03:09:23.167]  I promise you'll do it.
[03:09:23.187 --> 03:09:24.267]  Everything's going to be okay.
[03:09:24.307 --> 03:09:26.088]  And he thought like, oh, Jones just got banned.
[03:09:26.348 --> 03:09:27.148]  He's peaking now.
[03:09:27.369 --> 03:09:28.189]  This will all go away.
[03:09:28.209 --> 03:09:30.170]  I'm like, listen, you don't need to have me on the show.
[03:09:30.690 --> 03:09:32.491]  Just stop reading their talking points.
[03:09:33.891 --> 03:09:35.792]  He goes, you're on next month.
[03:09:35.972 --> 03:09:36.752]  Never talk to me again.
[03:09:36.772 --> 03:09:37.613]  Psssh.
[03:09:37.633 --> 03:09:38.153]  Radio silence.
[03:09:39.642 --> 03:09:53.869]  And then, my son listens, so he gives me clips, and I start telling my son, like, in the morning and stuff, we're cooking breakfast, because this is what we do, like, you know, 6.30 in the morning, it's a ritual, we're in there cooking for my wife and my three daughters, and we cook a big breakfast every morning, I'm like, stop telling me what he said about me!
[03:09:54.149 --> 03:09:55.549]  And he shows me, and I'm like, argh!
[03:09:56.090 --> 03:09:58.471]  So, it's like crapping on me and rubbing it in.
[03:10:00.402 --> 03:10:08.351]  And he's just saying more talking points, and more talking points, and clearly, and then I talk to people that know him, and they're like, well, Joe's hanging out with these professors.
[03:10:08.371 --> 03:10:09.072]  You know what that means.
[03:10:09.893 --> 03:10:10.874]  Vocal professors.
[03:10:11.875 --> 03:10:16.120]  He's hanging out with the leftist professors who, you know, have a three-letter name to them.
[03:10:16.861 --> 03:10:18.221]  And I'm just like, oh my God.
[03:10:18.301 --> 03:10:19.242]  And then I just see it.
[03:10:19.302 --> 03:10:19.722]  I see it.
[03:10:19.742 --> 03:10:21.462]  I'm like, dude, I'm not stupid.
[03:10:21.942 --> 03:10:22.482]  Stop it.
[03:10:23.383 --> 03:10:25.203]  You don't have to have me on to counter all this.
[03:10:25.523 --> 03:10:26.483]  You can throw me under the bus.
[03:10:26.623 --> 03:10:28.244]  Just don't rub it in.
[03:10:28.264 --> 03:10:29.504]  And he won't stop.
[03:10:29.524 --> 03:10:31.224]  And then I start sitting back.
[03:10:31.704 --> 03:10:42.727]  What I know about the psychedelic movement, who's funding it, what I know about how they try to create these culture groups that, you know, are self-help and, you know, how their fronts, how they use universities.
[03:10:43.547 --> 03:10:50.312]  As front groups, the UT Psychology Department, working with certain groups to test things in certain areas and all the rest of it.
[03:10:50.372 --> 03:11:00.780]  And I'm like, oh my God, I've been sitting right next to this and not doing a thing about it because I'm just busy, not expecting someone I know is right there with it all.
[03:11:01.160 --> 03:11:12.089]  And then they're actively not just letting me get chewed up and not have response, but aiding in it, reveling to curry favor with the establishment.
[03:11:13.177 --> 03:11:16.398]  And so, that, therein lies the thing.
[03:11:17.198 --> 03:11:19.798]  I mean, let's just say this.
[03:11:23.519 --> 03:11:24.279]  Let's just say this.
[03:11:26.400 --> 03:11:31.681]  I haven't gotten my eyes dotted and my teeth crossed.
[03:11:32.361 --> 03:11:39.803]  And I've got stuff just about the general field that is, let's just say,
[03:11:41.204 --> 03:11:44.326]  Shooting photon torpedoes down the Death Star reactor shaft.
[03:11:45.066 --> 03:11:50.469]  And that's what frustrates me, is people, because I'm genuine and real, think I'm that dumb.
[03:11:51.250 --> 03:11:52.330]  And I'm that stupid.
[03:11:52.711 --> 03:11:55.172]  And that I will put up with that crap, and I will not!
[03:11:55.872 --> 03:11:56.773]  So I'm Benjamin, anyways.
[03:11:56.793 --> 03:11:58.994]  I'm not going to get into it all, and I really don't want to.
[03:11:59.014 --> 03:12:01.075]  And it's not something like, you better have me on.
[03:12:01.155 --> 03:12:02.216]  I'll not go on his show.
[03:12:02.296 --> 03:12:02.616]  Period.
[03:12:02.976 --> 03:12:04.317]  Or if I do, I'm going to tear the living hell out of him.
[03:12:04.337 --> 03:12:04.938]  It's not going to happen.
[03:12:05.258 --> 03:12:06.939]  This isn't about getting on his goddamn show.
[03:12:07.179 --> 03:12:09.560]  If I wanted to be famous, I'd already sold out the system.
[03:12:09.820 --> 03:12:10.261]  You got it?
[03:12:11.241 --> 03:12:12.642]  My God is being authentic.
[03:12:12.882 --> 03:12:16.404]  But it's also about being authentic, which means I will be authentic.
[03:12:18.265 --> 03:12:19.466]  And so that transmission's coming.
[03:12:19.846 --> 03:12:24.369]  But when I do it, I'm gonna burn it down real good.
[03:12:25.489 --> 03:12:26.070]  Go ahead, Owen.
[03:12:26.090 --> 03:12:26.890]  You got any comments to that?
[03:12:27.871 --> 03:12:29.552]  Yeah, I mean, that's intense.
[03:12:29.632 --> 03:12:36.696]  I never even thought about how Deep State stuff interacts with college professors, because my dad's a professor.
[03:12:37.691 --> 03:12:43.581]  I've definitely seen some weird stuff going on with campuses, like Blossie Ford.
[03:12:44.222 --> 03:12:51.393]  She was out of a psych department at Stanford, I think, and all these people just seem to be associated with... Oh, Joe Rogan is the deep state.
[03:12:52.051 --> 03:12:55.274]  He's hiding right in plain view, Mr. Trendy, Mr. Cool.
[03:12:55.874 --> 03:12:57.376]  And he just wants a sponsor.
[03:12:57.396 --> 03:12:58.036]  He's ready to do it.
[03:12:58.737 --> 03:13:04.642]  And so... Yeah, well, one thing about Joe that I always thought was weird is how he doesn't have any opinions.
[03:13:04.682 --> 03:13:15.031]  Like, you'll listen to one episode, and then the next episode, he'll say the exact opposite, to the point where you're not coming from an authentic place.
[03:13:15.051 --> 03:13:15.791]  It's a chameleon.
[03:13:16.732 --> 03:13:18.654]  Yeah, a lot of people see that, too, and I think that
[03:13:19.338 --> 03:13:34.851]  You know, when I do live streams, a lot of people will write comments and I just react to comments and that's one reason why there's some videos out of me like talking some smack about Rogan is because a lot of people want to know about Rogan because people just keep being like, Rogan's a shill, Rogan's a shill.
[03:13:34.871 --> 03:13:35.652]  What do you think about Rogan?
[03:13:35.672 --> 03:13:39.615]  I'm like, I don't want to get involved in drama, you know, but that being said,
[03:13:40.396 --> 03:13:46.420]  He had me on and he told me that I shouldn't make fun of Sean King and that I don't represent myself properly on Twitter.
[03:13:46.841 --> 03:13:50.783]  Sean King looks like Errol Flynn or looks like Red Butler.
[03:13:51.124 --> 03:13:52.885]  The dude's whiter than I am.
[03:13:52.905 --> 03:13:54.766]  He's whiter than Bill Burr.
[03:13:54.806 --> 03:13:58.369]  He's like SPF 5000 and he's a horrible human being too.
[03:13:58.969 --> 03:14:02.951]  And so, he's a race-baiting, deep state liar.
[03:14:03.071 --> 03:14:14.037]  And so, when I'm on there, and then I get kicked off Twitter permanently, and then Rogan doesn't have me back on to tell people where to find me, at that point I kind of knew something was going on with him.
[03:14:14.077 --> 03:14:21.221]  And then, to see him not have you on when you were triple-D platformed, and just see that... Oh, he wants to be the last guy standing.
[03:14:21.261 --> 03:14:23.743]  And so, this is just Joe to understand that
[03:14:25.003 --> 03:14:27.745]  I kind of knew this, but I just wasn't busy thinking about it.
[03:14:28.485 --> 03:14:31.206]  And so I researched it more, and I looked into it.
[03:14:31.266 --> 03:14:35.068]  I made a few phone calls, and it's just like, wow.
[03:14:35.409 --> 03:14:35.769]  Wow.
[03:14:35.809 --> 03:14:42.513]  But this is how the system—let me tell you, he's now the chosen one by the left, even more than Jordan Peterson or any of those guys.
[03:14:42.553 --> 03:14:44.794]  They are handling him.
[03:14:44.914 --> 03:14:46.235]  They're positioning him.
[03:14:47.315 --> 03:14:47.815]  Everything.
[03:14:49.821 --> 03:14:54.804]  It's a very, very, uh, let's just say the whole thing's got a glass jaw.
[03:14:55.104 --> 03:14:57.725]  And I don't even take pleasure in that, but I do take pleasure.
[03:14:58.286 --> 03:15:03.108]  Because all these so-called alpha males don't get, I will frickin' punch hard when I need to.
[03:15:03.789 --> 03:15:04.809]  And it's not about me.
[03:15:05.410 --> 03:15:13.594]  It's about once I know the truth, and once I, everything is clear, like, you know, you're busy in your life, and all of a sudden things crystallize, Owen, and then you know the truth.
[03:15:14.595 --> 03:15:16.836]  Well, he also looks exactly like a human chomp.
[03:15:17.556 --> 03:15:18.637]  Don't put that graphic up.
[03:15:19.508 --> 03:15:21.150]  Yeah, this is proof of cloning.
[03:15:23.053 --> 03:15:31.343]  This is absolute proof that they can now clone human beings because I can't tell which one is Joe Rogan and which one is a clone.
[03:15:32.124 --> 03:15:33.907]  And I just, you know, I find that astounding.
[03:15:34.975 --> 03:15:45.500]  Alright, well, we'll have to have a part two about this, and I didn't want to digress into all that, but I know you got to go, and Roger Stone's coming up on the coast with me, but do two more minutes on the side, because I want to ask you, how do you think Trump's going to do?
[03:15:45.861 --> 03:15:53.745]  We're with some of your new shows coming up, which I know you have to send emails secretly to folks, it's Super Fight Club, with our good friend, TheHugePianist.com.
[03:15:54.005 --> 03:15:56.966]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com and NewsWorks.com.
[03:15:57.006 --> 03:15:58.107]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[03:16:02.355 --> 03:16:03.035]  You may need this.
[03:16:03.055 --> 03:16:07.176]  In the last eight years, we've seen the rise and now fall of the cryptocurrencies.
[03:16:08.136 --> 03:16:14.057]  And the entire time, I refused to take sponsors to fund our operation from the cryptocurrency market.
[03:16:14.537 --> 03:16:23.959]  Not because I thought every company was bad or that the whole thing's a scam, but at a gut level, I knew it was a giant bubble and I didn't want to be associated with that.
[03:16:24.459 --> 03:16:25.639]  Gut level, just couldn't do it.
[03:16:26.220 --> 03:16:28.520]  There have been many other sponsors I've refused.
[03:16:29.100 --> 03:16:41.548]  I have been offered and refused millions of dollars in sponsorship that would have been great to fight the info war from legitimate companies that sell marijuana-derived CBD oil, which has incredible attributes.
[03:16:41.628 --> 03:16:45.631]  Everybody knows about it on so many fronts and helps a lot of people.
[03:16:46.212 --> 03:16:54.418]  The reason I haven't gotten involved is the law hasn't been clear and some states, even though it doesn't get you high, see it as illegal.
[03:16:55.199 --> 03:17:15.074]  But now, they have developed and certified for years CBD rich oil derived from hemp that is completely legal in all 50 states and there are so many different permutations and combinations of what it's able to do and what the studies show it's done that it's mind-blowing.
[03:17:15.854 --> 03:17:22.839]  So we've worked with one of the biggest companies in the nation, and they wanted to just work with us openly because they want to stand up for America and freedom.
[03:17:22.860 --> 03:17:23.520]  They're patriots.
[03:17:23.880 --> 03:17:43.876]  But I said, listen, you just need to create your own new website for a private label for us, where you handle it all, where they get the best hemp-derived CBD oil, legal in all 50 states, from you, you drop ship it, you get it out, you have the website, I promote it, I send people there, and that way they're getting the very best from the experts.
[03:17:44.576 --> 03:17:45.537]  So again, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:17:45.717 --> 03:17:48.039]  Nothing wrong with marijuana-derived CBD oil.
[03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:58.767]  The problem is, some of the public and governments and municipalities get confused, and sometimes people get in trouble with CBD oil if it's too strong.
[03:17:59.527 --> 03:18:04.291]  This isn't CBD oil derived from marijuana that's high in THC.
[03:18:04.551 --> 03:18:09.574]  This is derived from industrial, high-quality, organic hemp.
[03:18:10.275 --> 03:18:12.216]  And it's legal in all 50 states.
[03:18:12.336 --> 03:18:12.637]  And now,
[03:18:13.837 --> 03:18:23.926]  Trump has signed the executive order allowing the industrial growing of hemp, so we won't even have to import it from Canada to Colorado, where it's then produced, bottled, and distributed.
[03:18:24.226 --> 03:18:26.068]  Now listen, I know a lot about it.
[03:18:26.108 --> 03:18:26.688]  I've researched it.
[03:18:26.728 --> 03:18:32.193]  I've turned down probably 20, 30 companies who've been wanting to sponsor us in the last six years.
[03:18:32.213 --> 03:18:33.614]  It's gotten really crazy in the last two.
[03:18:34.435 --> 03:18:46.348]  But now that the law is clear, now that our listeners can't get burned, now that we have a partnership with one of the top companies in the United States known for their organic quality, known for being patriots,
[03:18:47.657 --> 03:18:55.522]  They have created a new website and a private label of their entire spectrum of award-winning products called Washington's Reserve.
[03:18:56.182 --> 03:19:12.412]  And there are so many attributes, so many different things that hemp-derived, hemp-rich CBD oil has to offer that you just need to go to washingtonsreserve.com for yourself and see it all because they have more than 40 products.
[03:19:12.772 --> 03:19:15.534]  Now remember, the Globalists have tried to take our merchant accounts away.
[03:19:15.734 --> 03:19:16.735]  They've tried to shut us down.
[03:19:17.515 --> 03:19:18.716]  They've tried to boycott us.
[03:19:18.736 --> 03:19:19.536]  They've tried to sue us.
[03:19:20.056 --> 03:19:26.540]  And I've said in the last six months, I'm going to move not away from a direct sales marketing of great products to you to fund us.
[03:19:26.760 --> 03:19:34.524]  We're still going to do that with themforwarslife.com, but we're also going to bring on the best sponsors in the country, the very best products.
[03:19:34.624 --> 03:19:36.445]  And this is the first big one.
[03:19:36.805 --> 03:19:37.666]  So I'm very excited.
[03:19:37.706 --> 03:19:38.486]  Be sure and go there.
[03:19:38.526 --> 03:19:45.190]  Experience the power of high quality hemp extract with CBD exclusively available at washingtonsreserve.com for the
[03:19:45.230 --> 03:19:47.692]  So, highest quality, the lowest prices.
[03:19:48.132 --> 03:19:53.917]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, at washingtonsreserve.com, and you're helping fund the info war the whole time.
[03:19:55.258 --> 03:19:58.821]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:34.793 --> 03:20:36.094]  All right, Roger Stone's in the wings.
[03:20:36.134 --> 03:20:37.395]  Might take over here just a few minutes.
[03:20:38.596 --> 03:20:44.180]  And, you know, I just spent some time on Joe Rogan.
[03:20:45.020 --> 03:20:48.503]  You know, it was Timothy Leary.
[03:20:48.543 --> 03:20:49.703]  This is declassified, by the way.
[03:20:49.723 --> 03:20:51.124]  I'm not saying things that are my opinion.
[03:20:51.665 --> 03:20:56.868]  Who, from the beginning as a professor, got busted doing some things that were illegal.
[03:20:57.789 --> 03:21:01.371]  And so the CIA and the FBI got him as an informant by the 50s.
[03:21:02.881 --> 03:21:13.831]  And by the early 60s, they said, you're going to introduce drugs to the kids, you're going to introduce LSD, and be our cover guy while we have local labs and all the universities producing it.
[03:21:14.912 --> 03:21:23.599]  And I just so happened to know some people who were here in the 60s who were producing LSD at the University of Texas for the Central Intelligence Agency.
[03:21:24.060 --> 03:21:26.122]  Little Bird told me about it a long time ago.
[03:21:28.314 --> 03:21:31.215]  And so, they have these local gurus everywhere.
[03:21:31.255 --> 03:21:34.855]  So then, later in life, you run into it and you go, oh my God, it's the same thing.
[03:21:35.456 --> 03:21:55.080]  And so, that's what all this is, is introducing how cool and great these things are, but not just so they can get you on the drugs, the DMT, all the rest of it, but so you're listening to them as their guru when you're on the drug, which is a at-far mind control operation.
[03:21:55.973 --> 03:22:00.717]  And then they set up a health clinic or a workout thing, a cool thing.
[03:22:01.297 --> 03:22:02.498]  And they've got these girls.
[03:22:03.218 --> 03:22:04.339]  And everything's cool.
[03:22:04.900 --> 03:22:07.201]  And now you're in the club, depending on who you are.
[03:22:07.221 --> 03:22:08.662]  And they get celebrities there.
[03:22:08.803 --> 03:22:12.265]  And now they've got a cult going.
[03:22:13.006 --> 03:22:14.567]  For politics, for blackmail.
[03:22:14.727 --> 03:22:15.928]  I mean, not Joe Rogan.
[03:22:16.188 --> 03:22:17.309]  I was talking about Timothy Leary.
[03:22:17.969 --> 03:22:20.191]  So that's what I'm talking about, Owen Benjamin.
[03:22:20.331 --> 03:22:21.672]  And that's the stuff.
[03:22:22.713 --> 03:22:25.335]  I mean, you know, Bill Cosby even got convicted of drugging women.
[03:22:26.886 --> 03:22:36.070]  But what if what Timothy Leary did was going on in every city, major city around the country, and what if people didn't know about it?
[03:22:36.410 --> 03:22:38.191]  That'd be a pretty big story, Owen.
[03:22:40.271 --> 03:22:41.492]  Wow, that's intense, man.
[03:22:41.712 --> 03:22:42.733]  That's so intense.
[03:22:43.993 --> 03:22:44.893]  I didn't even think about that.
[03:22:45.374 --> 03:22:47.554]  Does Jordan Peterson fit into this?
[03:22:47.574 --> 03:22:51.116]  Because he's got that whole, like, professor vibe going on, too, you know?
[03:22:51.476 --> 03:22:53.117]  Oh, well, Jordan, you know.
[03:22:53.840 --> 03:22:54.520]  And again, I want to be clear.
[03:22:55.001 --> 03:22:56.142]  I support Tucker Carlson.
[03:22:56.202 --> 03:22:56.982]  I support Sean Hannity.
[03:22:57.022 --> 03:22:57.562]  I support Trump.
[03:22:57.963 --> 03:23:02.205]  I'm not one of these guys that like sees people that are successful and smart and goes, I gotta shoot them down to prove I'm big.
[03:23:03.546 --> 03:23:09.030]  I'm only talking about all this because I feel bad that I saw it and was even kind of told it like I was an idiot.
[03:23:09.750 --> 03:23:15.374]  And I was like, and a few compromising attempts by certain people.
[03:23:19.284 --> 03:23:22.525]  And then I started thinking later, like, you know what I mean?
[03:23:22.545 --> 03:23:25.726]  Like, when you know people, not Joe, not him, or not other people.
[03:23:26.046 --> 03:23:33.289]  I mean, just when you know people and then they try something on you, you tend to not be as awake to it.
[03:23:39.491 --> 03:23:41.572]  Dude, that's, I don't even know what to say.
[03:23:41.592 --> 03:23:43.453]  Like, this is kind of blowing my mind a little bit.
[03:23:43.513 --> 03:23:47.314]  Well, you know there's going to be some people, there's going to be some people crapping their britches tonight.
[03:23:49.443 --> 03:23:53.146]  Yeah, it's like, I don't know, man, that sounds intense.
[03:23:53.186 --> 03:24:03.054]  I remember that the whole intellectual dark web seemed a little odd to me when they started turning on Brett Kavanaugh as a unit, and then I realized it was kind of a political apparatus.
[03:24:03.474 --> 03:24:12.501]  And that's when I first, because I was a big Jordan Peterson fan, until he said that Brett Kavanaugh should step down, and that went in the face of everything that he created.
[03:24:12.562 --> 03:24:17.946]  Exactly, they build their political capital, their avant-garde, until that last moment they show who they are.
[03:24:18.891 --> 03:24:25.034]  Yeah, and then you listen to his biblical talks and stuff and it's all about the Eye of Horus and all this Egyptian imagery and stuff.
[03:24:25.054 --> 03:24:27.455]  The New York Times promotes him and everybody else.
[03:24:27.975 --> 03:24:30.397]  Everybody in, meet the Renegades, the intellectual dark web.
[03:24:30.417 --> 03:24:35.019]  You read that and you get the battle list of how the left's trying to invade our attempt to free people.
[03:24:36.075 --> 03:24:46.420]  Yeah, yeah, and it's like they had me on that list in the beginning, because that dude right there, Eric, said that I was like the every man's genius or something.
[03:24:46.460 --> 03:24:55.485]  Let's be clear, they tell you how you're a genius who's already successful to recruit you to start riding their you-know-what, and then they tell you to stay in our cool club, you've got to do this.
[03:24:56.485 --> 03:24:57.945]  Right, and I'm incapable of that.
[03:24:58.425 --> 03:25:01.106]  And that's why I'm not good in politics at all.
[03:25:01.566 --> 03:25:09.987]  Because I'm incapable of having people be like, OK, but you have to pretend this nonsense in order to stay in the club.
[03:25:10.027 --> 03:25:11.488]  And I'm like, then I'm out.
[03:25:11.528 --> 03:25:12.448]  I'll just chop wood.
[03:25:12.848 --> 03:25:13.688]  No, you're right.
[03:25:13.788 --> 03:25:14.188]  You're right.
[03:25:14.208 --> 03:25:14.588]  You're right.
[03:25:14.628 --> 03:25:22.589]  Well, just imagine when we see him with Kevin Spacey and all this, imagine all the witnesses out there.
[03:25:24.410 --> 03:25:25.750]  Imagine all the witnesses out there.
[03:25:28.490 --> 03:25:29.050]  Imagine that.
[03:25:29.170 --> 03:25:30.751]  Can you imagine that for me for just a second?
[03:25:32.432 --> 03:25:36.675]  For a minute, like, the witnesses, because it's not just two hours earlier.
[03:25:36.875 --> 03:25:43.719]  I've got people years ago before I even knew some of the names of these folks telling me all about it.
[03:25:43.799 --> 03:25:45.640]  And then I later hear from other people.
[03:25:46.080 --> 03:25:48.142]  And then I ask myself, why are the people like this?
[03:25:48.162 --> 03:25:51.303]  Because like you said, Owen Benjamin, it's about power.
[03:25:52.044 --> 03:25:53.925]  These people don't have real power.
[03:25:54.505 --> 03:25:56.867]  And so they seek to create artificial systems of power.
[03:25:57.659 --> 03:26:04.029]  Yeah, like I'm pretty sure Joe Rogan is legally considered a little person, like he can park in handicapped parking lots.
[03:26:04.650 --> 03:26:10.639]  And so when you're that small, and you feel small, because I know little dudes that don't feel small.
[03:26:11.554 --> 03:26:12.715]  Um, and they're cool.
[03:26:12.835 --> 03:26:13.555]  They're totally cool.
[03:26:13.595 --> 03:26:15.015]  But, like, it's about power.
[03:26:15.556 --> 03:26:17.596]  And I've never had that problem.
[03:26:17.656 --> 03:26:18.757]  It might be hype.
[03:26:18.777 --> 03:26:20.337]  By the way, I'm 5'11", and I don't feel little.
[03:26:20.398 --> 03:26:21.698]  And Joe's only a few inches shorter than me.
[03:26:22.038 --> 03:26:23.399]  But I don't get the whole little guy thing.
[03:26:23.439 --> 03:26:25.580]  But, I mean, yeah, there's Joe.
[03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:26.900]  You're a big guy.
[03:26:27.460 --> 03:26:28.601]  How does Joe behave around you?
[03:26:30.001 --> 03:26:31.602]  Well, I always thought he was 5'5".
[03:26:31.942 --> 03:26:32.902]  That was what I was told.
[03:26:32.982 --> 03:26:35.443]  So if you're 5'11", you have a good 7 inches on the guy.
[03:26:36.004 --> 03:26:37.024]  Or 6 inches, or whatever.
[03:26:38.775 --> 03:26:40.018]  I just don't get the list.
[03:26:40.479 --> 03:26:44.349]  I don't have a Napoleonic complex, but you're saying Joe has a Napoleonic complex.
[03:26:44.960 --> 03:26:48.801]  Well, people that crave power over truth always do.
[03:26:48.841 --> 03:26:51.001]  And I know tall people in Napoleon Complexes.
[03:26:51.461 --> 03:26:57.883]  You know, there's probably times in my life when I've had Napoleon Complexes where I'm totally just kidding about the tall thing.
[03:26:57.923 --> 03:26:59.083]  I just think it's a funny theme.
[03:26:59.463 --> 03:27:02.984]  But like, there's little dudes that have a Napoleon Complex.
[03:27:03.004 --> 03:27:04.584]  There's big dudes that have a Napoleon Complex.
[03:27:04.644 --> 03:27:06.984]  And it's about control over other people over truth.
[03:27:07.404 --> 03:27:14.626]  And once you make that satanic deal, that truly is a Faustian deal where you take control over truth
[03:27:15.506 --> 03:27:22.751]  Your life starts becoming awful, and you're in a prison with golden bars, as Mickey Rourke said in Barfly.
[03:27:22.771 --> 03:27:24.632]  I always thought that was such a good line.
[03:27:24.652 --> 03:27:27.114]  You're in a prison with golden bars, you know?
[03:27:28.695 --> 03:27:31.737]  And again, there have been a lot of people that got scared during this purge.
[03:27:31.777 --> 03:27:33.238]  A lot of people that did all these bad things.
[03:27:34.899 --> 03:27:38.762]  It's just the larger continuum of the truth has to be told.
[03:27:40.066 --> 03:27:43.387]  And then people just hope that that truth doesn't then come out.
[03:27:43.567 --> 03:27:57.653]  And I just hope that the Joe Rogan experience of cucking to the left, cucking to the control, giving into the establishment, not standing up to people you claim are your friends, I just hope that that doesn't become the modicum of the new century.
[03:27:57.693 --> 03:27:58.113]  What do you think?
[03:27:59.107 --> 03:28:11.950]  Well, as you're talking, I'm so glad I don't have horrible secrets and that my most shameful moments are free for anybody to see because people have already tried to use them against me.
[03:28:12.610 --> 03:28:19.511]  And I have a relationship with my wife where she knows my darkest moments and darkest thoughts and darkest experiences.
[03:28:19.571 --> 03:28:26.813]  So it feels absolutely unbelievable to have a life where I don't have to worry about something horrible coming out.
[03:28:27.761 --> 03:28:28.722]  Uh, wow.
[03:28:29.342 --> 03:28:29.962]  So I'm grateful.
[03:28:31.143 --> 03:28:35.505]  Well, I don't think Joe knew about the intelligence agencies recruiting him until they were all around him.
[03:28:36.465 --> 03:28:38.106]  But I think there's an embracer.
[03:28:40.058 --> 03:28:44.162]  Going on, but not it wasn't about him earlier about CIA cults and sex cults.
[03:28:44.242 --> 03:28:52.591]  I'm talking about somebody else but no seriously, but Owen Benjamin, HugePianist.com.
[03:28:52.611 --> 03:28:54.032]  I'm Alex Jones, TheNewsWorks.com.
[03:28:54.493 --> 03:28:56.134]  We'll talk to you soon my friend.
[03:28:56.174 --> 03:28:56.595]  God bless.
[03:28:56.635 --> 03:28:57.115]  Have a great week.
[03:28:57.195 --> 03:28:57.796]  You're the man.
[03:28:58.056 --> 03:28:58.537]  You're the man.
[03:28:58.557 --> 03:28:59.097]  Thanks Alex.
[03:28:59.177 --> 03:28:59.478]  Thank you.
[03:28:59.498 --> 03:29:00.919]  We'll be back with Roger Stone.
[03:29:07.338 --> 03:29:19.296]  Conservatively, there have been several thousand articles written in the last three years demonizing InfoWars, and yours truly, for selling high-quality supplements.
[03:29:20.498 --> 03:29:39.004]  In fact, even the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, that owns the biggest sellers of supplements in the world, even that organization has written hit pieces claiming I'm a fraud and selling snake oil when they're owned by a man who owns Amazon and Whole Foods.
[03:29:40.624 --> 03:29:42.685]  Amazon was the number one supplement seller in the world.
[03:29:43.065 --> 03:29:43.925]  Whole Foods was number two.
[03:29:44.785 --> 03:29:50.087]  He owns the number one and number two biggest supplement sellers on the planet.
[03:29:51.673 --> 03:29:57.938]  And then his publication, a weaponized disinformation op, says I'm bad and should be shut down.
[03:29:59.219 --> 03:30:12.909]  When more than 15 of the 70 products we have at InfoWarsLife.com are private labeled, highest quality, top of the line, that are sold at Whole Foods for higher prices.
[03:30:13.810 --> 03:30:15.872]  Think about the level of that fraud.
[03:30:16.801 --> 03:30:19.689]  And I've sent messages to these news organizations pointing that out.
[03:30:19.870 --> 03:30:20.471]  No response.
[03:30:20.692 --> 03:30:21.694]  They never want to get my comment.
[03:30:22.216 --> 03:30:23.138]  Now, why am I saying that?
[03:30:24.402 --> 03:30:24.783]  It's simple.
[03:30:25.816 --> 03:30:30.380]  We have a lot of proprietary original products, but a lot of them are also private labeled.
[03:30:30.760 --> 03:30:36.065]  Whatever already has five stars, whatever people already love, whatever's been tested to be the best.
[03:30:36.726 --> 03:30:37.947]  So we have a great product.
[03:30:38.067 --> 03:30:38.487]  You love it.
[03:30:38.547 --> 03:30:39.168]  You reorder it.
[03:30:39.548 --> 03:30:41.810]  The Globals are going to test our products, trying to find something.
[03:30:42.271 --> 03:30:44.192]  So we're going to be able to, you know, defeat all that.
[03:30:44.352 --> 03:30:45.393]  It's a 360 win.
[03:30:45.754 --> 03:30:46.434]  We defeat them.
[03:30:46.514 --> 03:30:46.895]  You win.
[03:30:47.015 --> 03:30:47.355]  I win.
[03:30:47.655 --> 03:30:48.176]  It's amazing.
[03:30:50.023 --> 03:30:54.805]  And you've seen them come after our attempts to even process credit cards and shut down InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:30:54.845 --> 03:31:10.431]  I mean, it's incredible not just what frauds they are and how they're anti-free market and how they're racketeering against us, not just Jeff Bezos, but this entire system of mainstream media and mainstream corporations and banking are even worse than Bezos and Amazon.
[03:31:12.366 --> 03:31:12.867]  It's hard to believe.
[03:31:12.967 --> 03:31:15.689]  I'm just illustrating how crazy this all is.
[03:31:15.769 --> 03:31:23.275]  Now, I'm going to be cutting some informational pieces in the next few weeks that go into great depth on each one of the products.
[03:31:24.115 --> 03:31:26.357]  I've done this for some of the products, but I haven't done it in a while.
[03:31:26.377 --> 03:31:35.904]  I haven't done it for the new products because, quite frankly, it's like going to school for a college exam to try to accurately talk about how great these products are.
[03:31:35.984 --> 03:31:36.705]  But just know this.
[03:31:38.703 --> 03:31:46.828]  Whatever the attributes that Jeff Bezos and Amazon and Whole Foods are allowed to tell you about their flagship products, these are as good or better.
[03:31:47.148 --> 03:31:49.369]  These are all the top of the line, very best.
[03:31:50.109 --> 03:32:00.415]  I can't even tell you what they do and the history of it and how amazing they are because they selectively enforce and will send the FDA after us.
[03:32:01.255 --> 03:32:02.336]  You see, I'm a subhuman.
[03:32:02.436 --> 03:32:03.117]  I'm garbage.
[03:32:04.117 --> 03:32:05.758]  So Bezos can make all the claims.
[03:32:05.958 --> 03:32:07.259]  Whole Foods can make all the claims.
[03:32:08.450 --> 03:32:09.833]  Because this stuff is dynamite.
[03:32:10.435 --> 03:32:11.597]  Turmeric's dynamite.
[03:32:12.319 --> 03:32:14.003]  Iodine that's clean is dynamite.
[03:32:15.125 --> 03:32:16.789]  Super Mel Vitality, they have similar products.
[03:32:16.869 --> 03:32:17.571]  It's all dynamite.
[03:32:19.147 --> 03:32:21.848]  They can tell you how great it is, and show you all the facts, and tell you.
[03:32:22.068 --> 03:32:23.008]  Because they're the elite.
[03:32:23.348 --> 03:32:24.048]  I'm just scum.
[03:32:24.669 --> 03:32:25.589]  Just like you, according to them.
[03:32:25.629 --> 03:32:28.050]  But the good news is, you've seen how great these products work.
[03:32:28.410 --> 03:32:32.591]  We do break down some of the basics on each page at mforwarslife.com to see how wonderful they are.
[03:32:33.071 --> 03:32:38.153]  But experience turmeric, experience X3, experience Supramel Vitality, Supramel Vitality.
[03:32:38.333 --> 03:32:42.354]  That, by the way, is the last run of our best-selling product, Supramel Vitality, Supramel.
[03:32:42.394 --> 03:32:48.476]  Because we can't even get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, so we can't get the supply, and I'm sick of it, so I'm discontinuing it.
[03:32:48.996 --> 03:32:49.936]  Because it's so frustrating.
[03:32:49.956 --> 03:32:53.157]  This is the last run, and it's all 50% off.
[03:32:53.297 --> 03:32:58.178]  Bodies, X3, and Supermail at mfullwarsstore.com and mfullwarslife.com.
[03:32:58.358 --> 03:32:59.239]  Thanks for your support.
[03:33:06.220 --> 03:33:08.841]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.283 --> 03:33:18.883]  Welcome back!
[03:33:19.864 --> 03:33:20.785]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.805 --> 03:33:22.546]  I appreciate Roger letting me take over half the show.
[03:33:22.566 --> 03:33:25.067]  We'll be back in the War Room coming up later this afternoon.
[03:33:25.107 --> 03:33:35.674]  Infowars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com
[03:33:48.103 --> 03:33:53.248]  And so it's not with pleasure that I talk about some of the things I'm going to be doing in the near future.
[03:33:53.908 --> 03:33:54.729]  It's out of duty.
[03:33:55.970 --> 03:33:56.591]  And I will do it.
[03:33:57.372 --> 03:33:58.293]  I will execute it all.
[03:33:58.313 --> 03:34:03.518]  It may take me a little bit longer, always, to get things done, but everybody knows I'm dog-like.
[03:34:04.018 --> 03:34:04.919]  I'm dutiful.
[03:34:06.020 --> 03:34:08.762]  And I'll do my best to deliver on what I say.
[03:34:09.523 --> 03:34:10.144]  Or die trying.
[03:34:11.550 --> 03:34:13.933]  Roger, we were there last night thinking he would declare an emergency.
[03:34:13.973 --> 03:34:15.014]  They'd signaled they would.
[03:34:15.074 --> 03:34:16.135]  It's what needs to be done.
[03:34:16.155 --> 03:34:18.237]  Now Trump's back out saying he may still do it.
[03:34:18.798 --> 03:34:21.280]  But I think it's more of them, you know, he's going to pull out of war zones.
[03:34:21.380 --> 03:34:22.161]  Oh, no, he can't do it.
[03:34:22.602 --> 03:34:24.804]  Oh, he's going to release the illegal spying.
[03:34:24.844 --> 03:34:25.605]  Then he doesn't do it.
[03:34:26.085 --> 03:34:27.186]  Or he orders that they don't do it.
[03:34:29.991 --> 03:34:31.612]  18 hours after we were live last night.
[03:34:32.353 --> 03:34:35.055]  I just want to know from you, what do you make about the situation in D.C.?
[03:34:35.095 --> 03:34:44.542]  Because I see a lot of good things Trump's doing, but also this refusal to declare the emergency that every other president's done since Roosevelt to really use his executive power and circumvent these people.
[03:34:45.322 --> 03:34:46.103]  Why is he doing it?
[03:34:46.623 --> 03:34:47.764]  What is the advice he's getting?
[03:34:49.062 --> 03:35:01.846]  Well, if you read the coverage today, and last night I said I wanted to look at the coverage and try to work my sources, I really think, unfortunately, the president has once again ceded to the accommodationists.
[03:35:02.267 --> 03:35:06.108]  According to today's New York Times, last night's speech and its content,
[03:35:06.408 --> 03:35:11.651]  Unfortunately, I don't think turning the other cheek to congressional Democrats is ever going to work.
[03:35:27.519 --> 03:35:47.629]  And if the idea was that the arguments made by the president, which were most cogent, most compelling, most factual, were expected to carry the day, I think that was largely undone by network television, who immediately, within seconds of the president's broadcast, were calling him a bald-faced liar.
[03:35:48.349 --> 03:35:53.452]  I have never seen a president subjected to this kind of vituperation.
[03:35:54.012 --> 03:36:03.399]  I've never seen any president lie to the American people as much as Barack Obama, but you never saw the networks call him out on your lies.
[03:36:03.419 --> 03:36:04.360]  Do I need to remind you?
[03:36:04.740 --> 03:36:08.463]  If you like your health care program, you can keep your health care.
[03:36:08.503 --> 03:36:18.491]  Well, they were saying he shouldn't even be on air, so I'm not mad at him that he had declared the emergency, but all his signs of reconciliation are only seen as weakness.
[03:36:20.075 --> 03:36:20.615]  Absolutely.
[03:36:20.675 --> 03:36:25.698]  Look, my mentor, President Nixon, said, there are men of action and men of words.
[03:36:26.118 --> 03:36:28.639]  There are times for action and time for words.
[03:36:29.119 --> 03:36:46.007]  This is a president who ordered the bombing of Hanoi and the mining of Haiphong Harbor on Christmas Day with a recalcitrant Congress where both houses were in control of the Democrats because it was time for bold action to bring that war to an end.
[03:36:46.447 --> 03:36:48.588]  This was a time for bold action.
[03:36:49.448 --> 03:36:52.189]  The Democrats are not going to fold.
[03:36:52.529 --> 03:36:54.730]  The President is not going to fold.
[03:36:55.791 --> 03:37:10.316]  I agree completely with what Senator Lindsey Graham said a little earlier, and that is that if the President does not deliver on his promise to seal our border, it's the functional end of his presidency.
[03:37:10.736 --> 03:37:12.897]  This is the raison d'etre
[03:37:13.117 --> 03:37:15.118]  Man, that's what I've been saying all day, right?
[03:37:15.158 --> 03:37:16.678]  He's acting like he's not the president.
[03:37:17.078 --> 03:37:18.419]  He's advocating authority.
[03:37:18.839 --> 03:37:21.420]  And so if he does that, they're going to come like wolves to the slaughter.
[03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:32.583]  Well, and we also, I now see, I can completely see the seeds of Mr. Mueller's argument that he has found Russian collusion.
[03:37:32.663 --> 03:37:35.844]  I think this became clear in the last 24 hours.
[03:37:35.884 --> 03:37:42.706]  So the vehicle for his, for the impeachment articles of the president is clear.
[03:37:43.486 --> 03:38:00.465]  The claim that Paul Manafort shared polling information, much of it public, but some of it private, with a man named Klimnik, who I don't know and never heard of before I read his name in the newspapers, but who has alleged ties to Russian intelligence,
[03:38:00.965 --> 03:38:07.715]  It will then be argued that the Russians somehow used this to direct their troll farms to affect the American electorate.
[03:38:07.755 --> 03:38:09.197]  Boy, that's an incredible stretch.
[03:38:09.718 --> 03:38:13.924]  So somebody looked at a poll that knew a Russian who fell off an apple cart.
[03:38:14.690 --> 03:38:21.454]  Yeah, but that's exactly where you, having found nothing else, it appears to me that that is now where they are going.
[03:38:21.874 --> 03:38:33.061]  Incredibly, the only reason we know this is because Manafort's own lawyers failed to properly redact the documents that they released yesterday, which is beyond belief.
[03:38:33.481 --> 03:38:40.906]  These are, by the way, the same lawyers who never questioned whether he was under inappropriate or illegal or unconstitutional
[03:38:41.426 --> 03:38:43.207]  Well, let me ask you this question, then.
[03:38:43.247 --> 03:38:45.189]  Mueller's extended the thing another six months, like you predicted.
[03:38:45.229 --> 03:38:48.851]  They've got all these new investigations they're about to fire up in the House.
[03:39:10.666 --> 03:39:13.472]  I mean, what do you think of Trump's overall strategy right now?
[03:39:15.350 --> 03:39:17.171]  It's a strategy of retreat.
[03:39:17.251 --> 03:39:40.997]  Now the good news is that Rod Rosenstein is leaving, but I just learned today that Bill Barr, who is the nominee for Attorney General, had Robert Mueller as an invited guest at both of his daughter's weddings, and that Mr. Barr's wife and Mr. Mueller's wife attend the same Bible study group.
[03:39:41.117 --> 03:39:41.437]  Oh boy.
[03:39:42.257 --> 03:39:45.599]  These are troubling deep state connections.
[03:39:46.500 --> 03:39:52.204]  I read previously that Bill Barr was involved at the Central Intelligence Agency under George H.W.
[03:39:52.244 --> 03:40:05.313]  Bush in the illegal trafficking of cocaine in and out of MENA, Arkansas, for the purposes of generating cash to illegally... Sure, so it's the continued neocon herpes that we can't get rid of.
[03:40:06.113 --> 03:40:06.393]  Right.
[03:40:06.774 --> 03:40:16.219]  Now Barr wrote some very encouraging critical things of the Mueller investigation, except for if you're a Republican, you're not entitled to have prior Republican opinions.
[03:40:16.619 --> 03:40:25.845]  So Jeannie Rhee can represent Hillary Clinton and then go on to try to prosecute Jerry Corsi and Roger Stone, despite that glaring conflict of interest.
[03:40:26.025 --> 03:40:27.406]  Sure, but the good news is...
[03:40:28.126 --> 03:40:30.228]  Trump is starting to fire a hell of a lot of people.
[03:40:30.268 --> 03:40:30.888]  They're leaving.
[03:40:31.309 --> 03:40:32.349]  So what's the word on that?
[03:40:32.410 --> 03:40:33.691]  Is he trying to clean house?
[03:40:33.771 --> 03:40:36.072]  I mean, he obviously is, but what's that going to lead to?
[03:40:36.833 --> 03:40:45.660]  Well, first of all, John Kelly was resisting a number of the president's initiatives right up to the very minute he left yesterday.
[03:40:45.980 --> 03:40:51.625]  The fact that he is now finally out of the building is good news for America and for the Trump agenda.
[03:40:51.645 --> 03:40:53.867]  So why did Kelly have to be drug out by his ankles?
[03:40:55.284 --> 03:40:59.967]  You know, it's a question I can't answer, but I do know Mick Mulvaney is a good man.
[03:40:59.987 --> 03:41:01.407]  He is not a deep stater.
[03:41:01.467 --> 03:41:03.528]  He is not an established Republican.
[03:41:03.928 --> 03:41:13.733]  He is a Trump loyalist who recognizes that his job is to implement what the president wants done, not to try to change what the president wants done.
[03:41:14.214 --> 03:41:18.976]  But to go back to the bar question, it's very important, Alex, and here's why.
[03:41:18.996 --> 03:41:20.897]  We can get into this on the other side some more.
[03:41:21.517 --> 03:41:33.863]  The two most important things I think the president must do, not only in addition to building the wall and seeing through the rest of his agenda, are dealing with the question of internet censorship and the question of ballot security.
[03:41:34.403 --> 03:41:37.184]  He can have the most successful administration in history.
[03:41:37.244 --> 03:41:40.146]  We can have the most robust economy in our history.
[03:41:40.346 --> 03:41:43.227]  It won't matter if we can't get an honest count.
[03:41:43.487 --> 03:41:46.169]  That's right, because the illegals are all about getting the fake votes.
[03:41:46.209 --> 03:41:50.091]  Well, deal with the fraud now, and deal with the censorship now.
[03:41:50.111 --> 03:41:50.692]  You're absolutely right.
[03:41:50.732 --> 03:41:53.033]  Roger, you're taking over on the other side.
[03:41:53.153 --> 03:41:54.014]  Powerful broadcast.
[03:41:54.034 --> 03:41:56.755]  State War Room is in only 19 minutes from now.
[03:41:56.835 --> 03:41:58.316]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:41:58.757 --> 03:42:01.879]  I didn't plug one time today, the products, or the t-shirts, or the books, or films.
[03:42:02.439 --> 03:42:02.939]  They're all there.
[03:42:02.999 --> 03:42:03.360]  They're great.
[03:42:03.400 --> 03:42:04.760]  Without you, we'll be shut down.
[03:42:04.780 --> 03:42:08.863]  There's a lot I didn't get to today, but Roger's going to cover it all on the other side.
[03:42:08.883 --> 03:42:09.784]  There's a big article out of
[03:42:11.275 --> 03:42:21.317]  See NBC News, those pretty powerful inside Facebook's cult-like workplace where dissidence is discouraged, dissent is discouraged, employees pretend to be happy all the time.
[03:42:21.817 --> 03:42:24.818]  Want to get an example of the new cult leftist system they're going to bring in?
[03:42:24.898 --> 03:42:25.438]  This is it.
[03:42:25.898 --> 03:42:27.919]  We'll be covering it tomorrow on the Thursday Show.
[03:42:27.939 --> 03:42:30.599]  Paul Watson joins us tomorrow and more.
[03:42:30.959 --> 03:42:33.920]  We're going to go to break and Roger Stone is going to take over.
[03:42:34.680 --> 03:42:36.261]  On the other side.
[03:42:36.741 --> 03:42:45.267]  But the one thing all these chicken-neck control freaks need to know is we're going to fight back, and we're going to take it to them in the information war.
[03:42:45.847 --> 03:42:48.689]  And that's, I think they finally figured that out.
[03:42:49.129 --> 03:42:52.692]  We're not a bunch of yes-men being hired by yes-men to produce more yes-men.
[03:42:53.192 --> 03:42:55.673]  We're Americans, we're humans, and we're coming.
[03:42:56.934 --> 03:42:58.035]  And we can smell victory.
[03:42:58.675 --> 03:42:59.496]  InfoWars.com.
[03:43:06.058 --> 03:43:08.059]  Ladies and gentlemen, the new year is here.
[03:43:08.539 --> 03:43:23.625]  And I personally, in the new year, am looking at all the great supplements and products at InfluenceLife.com and saying, what do I need to take religiously that I'm forgetting to take, that lowers inflammation, that empowers all the cells in the body, that makes me healthier, better stamina, libido, energy?
[03:43:23.905 --> 03:43:24.866]  And it's these three babies.
[03:43:25.726 --> 03:43:29.528]  It's Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Curcuminoid.
[03:43:29.608 --> 03:43:30.648]  Nobody else can top that.
[03:43:31.028 --> 03:43:32.088]  Top of the line in the nation.
[03:43:32.809 --> 03:43:38.631]  It's X3 that has all three of the good types of iodine together, including the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[03:43:39.111 --> 03:43:44.613]  Because some people can't absorb that type, we put a little bit of the other two types and a tiny bit of Vitamin C to stabilize it.
[03:43:44.853 --> 03:43:47.554]  And then Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[03:43:47.974 --> 03:43:51.896]  Super Male Vitality has been our overall most successful product.
[03:43:52.276 --> 03:43:54.937]  Neck and neck with Brain Force Plus.
[03:43:55.537 --> 03:44:01.719]  But because it's wildcrafted and a proprietary process, we weren't able to get it for long periods of time.
[03:44:02.640 --> 03:44:07.101]  And so I made the decision just to discontinue it and try to reformulate.
[03:44:07.522 --> 03:44:09.382]  But it's been very, very hard to do.
[03:44:09.422 --> 03:44:11.983]  So we're not discontinuing it because it's crap.
[03:44:12.103 --> 03:44:14.344]  We're discontinuing it because we can't get it.
[03:44:14.424 --> 03:44:18.325]  It may come back in the future, but right now we're just not able to bring you this.
[03:44:18.385 --> 03:44:19.406]  It's our last run of it.
[03:44:20.106 --> 03:44:20.727]  Proprietary.
[03:44:21.067 --> 03:44:21.508]  Amazing.
[03:44:21.768 --> 03:44:23.150]  It's at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:44:23.550 --> 03:44:25.112]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[03:44:25.732 --> 03:44:28.436]  Or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:44:28.956 --> 03:44:29.477]  Bodies.
[03:44:30.077 --> 03:44:31.599]  Turmeric formula.
[03:44:31.879 --> 03:44:34.382]  And it's supercharged with other key ingredients that...
[03:44:35.243 --> 03:44:35.824]  Supercharge it.
[03:44:35.844 --> 03:44:36.604]  Bring it to the next level.
[03:44:37.325 --> 03:44:38.706]  And then of course, it's the X3.
[03:44:38.766 --> 03:44:41.629]  It's our final run of X2.
[03:44:41.669 --> 03:44:53.299]  We've secured the Deep Earth Iodine, but I thought we'd make a better one with all three types and the vitamin C. So get your X2, get your X3, all at infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:53.559 --> 03:44:58.343]  And again, have a great New Year as we fight the globalists and restore the Republic and freedom to the planet.
[03:44:58.503 --> 03:44:58.984]  Thank you all.
[03:45:09.580 --> 03:45:11.300]  Let's go to Wild Man in Illinois.
[03:45:11.340 --> 03:45:13.681]  Thanks for holding, and not to say Happy New Year.
[03:45:13.701 --> 03:45:13.981]  Go ahead.
[03:45:14.282 --> 03:45:23.746]  Alex, yeah, going into 2019, what Trump's gotta do to save America, he's gotta declassify FISA, expose the corruption, arrest the traitors, and arrest the pedophiles.
[03:45:23.766 --> 03:45:24.966]  That's how he saves America.
[03:45:25.046 --> 03:45:28.748]  My opinion, an over-the-road trucker, hard-working, honest man, that's what I believe.
[03:45:29.008 --> 03:45:29.328]  I agree.
[03:45:29.408 --> 03:45:30.169]  Victory or death.
[03:45:30.209 --> 03:45:31.870]  He's now, looks like he's cleaning house.
[03:45:32.210 --> 03:45:33.690]  He's getting rid of all the double agents.
[03:45:34.271 --> 03:45:36.792]  And the word is Trump is going to go into battle now.
[03:45:37.172 --> 03:45:39.453]  We're talking he's going to strike back against the censorship.
[03:45:39.473 --> 03:45:41.194]  He's going to strike back against the pedophile rings.
[03:45:41.234 --> 03:45:41.794]  It's already begun.
[03:45:41.814 --> 03:45:43.876]  He's going to strike back against the deep state.
[03:45:44.396 --> 03:45:49.698]  He's going to strike back against all the criminal activity of Comey and Mueller being Russian operatives.
[03:45:50.079 --> 03:45:50.699]  So just get ready.
[03:45:51.279 --> 03:45:55.120]  Another note, I've spent over $3,000 in your store this year.
[03:45:55.320 --> 03:45:57.781]  I'm a loyal supporter, and thanks for great products.
[03:45:57.961 --> 03:45:58.981]  Brother, let me tell you something.
[03:45:59.061 --> 03:46:00.281]  I want to thank you.
[03:46:00.901 --> 03:46:07.763]  If folks like you didn't stand with us against the incredible Hillary Clinton and Soros attacks, which they admit they're running, we would not be here now.
[03:46:08.443 --> 03:46:09.844]  They're taking Michael Savage off the air!
[03:46:10.984 --> 03:46:12.045]  They're taking everybody.
[03:46:12.085 --> 03:46:13.886]  They took Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[03:46:13.906 --> 03:46:17.008]  They need to get us all off the air before they make their move on Trump.
[03:46:17.068 --> 03:46:18.969]  That's why this is a war.
[03:46:19.489 --> 03:46:21.010]  And you supporting us is incredible.
[03:46:21.251 --> 03:46:22.551]  Which products do you like the best?
[03:46:22.692 --> 03:46:24.273]  Man, I use the bodies.
[03:46:24.353 --> 03:46:25.573]  I got so many t-shirts.
[03:46:25.593 --> 03:46:26.654]  It ain't even funny.
[03:46:26.714 --> 03:46:31.337]  I got your stickers posted on my hard hat, on my GPS, my truck.
[03:46:31.777 --> 03:46:35.340]  I tell truckers about you over the CB Airways all across the country.
[03:46:35.640 --> 03:46:36.801]  I spread the word about you.
[03:46:36.961 --> 03:46:40.043]  I wear your clothes, your hat, your shirts, you name it.
[03:46:40.683 --> 03:46:41.864]  Multitude of products.
[03:46:42.164 --> 03:46:45.826]  How much love do you get versus, how much love versus hate do you get?
[03:46:45.867 --> 03:46:52.731]  Um, you know, it's, uh, people skeptical, but like, it's probably about 50-50 or 60-40 year way.
[03:46:52.791 --> 03:46:55.613]  I just, I guess so many people got their head in the sand out here.
[03:47:06.140 --> 03:47:08.842]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:27.275 --> 03:47:27.976]  Welcome back.
[03:47:28.536 --> 03:47:32.218]  I'm Roger Stone and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:33.199 --> 03:47:41.143]  The last two segments were so intense that we didn't get a chance to tell you that you are the lifeblood that keeps us alive.
[03:47:41.798 --> 03:47:54.181]  You see, we here at InfoWars can't depend on any George Soros-style conservatives to write enormous checks to subsidize the important work we do here at InfoWars.
[03:47:54.581 --> 03:47:59.162]  We depend completely and totally on you, our listeners and our viewers.
[03:47:59.462 --> 03:48:06.404]  Which is why I urge you to go to the InfoWars.com store right now and look at some of our terrific specials.
[03:48:06.904 --> 03:48:13.006]  Those who denigrate the nutraceuticals at InfoWars have no idea what they are talking about.
[03:48:13.466 --> 03:48:25.929]  As someone who has used alternative medicine including acupuncture, tai chi and natural herbology for over 40 years, I can tell you that the products at InfoWars are cutting edge.
[03:48:26.129 --> 03:48:26.389]  Why?
[03:48:26.909 --> 03:48:43.474]  Because we combine the very best of ancient Chinese herbology with really cutting-edge nutraceutical new discoveries that are scientifically based to produce some of the most effective products in the country.
[03:48:43.874 --> 03:48:48.295]  Now you can go to Whole Foods, there's no question, and you can buy products
[03:48:48.735 --> 03:48:48.915]  I think?
[03:49:09.108 --> 03:49:21.737]  Or one that I have taken at the recommendation of Owen Schroeder and had great success with, BODYS, which I think may be the single best turmeric product on the American market today.
[03:49:22.177 --> 03:49:28.541]  Turmeric has been used literally for centuries for muscle and joint pain to ease inflammation.
[03:49:28.641 --> 03:49:30.983]  So whether it is a job where you're on your feet,
[03:49:31.843 --> 03:49:34.764]  My one of my granddaughters worked as a waitress.
[03:49:35.104 --> 03:49:40.145]  She complained about her legs and her feet hurting because of the long hours on her feet.
[03:49:40.285 --> 03:49:44.826]  I recommended bodies and she said, Grandpa, this stuff is amazing.
[03:49:44.926 --> 03:49:47.087]  My pain was gone by the end of the day.
[03:49:47.487 --> 03:49:50.487]  I take it prophylactically and I've had no more problem.
[03:49:50.848 --> 03:49:52.688]  There's a firsthand testimony
[03:49:52.968 --> 03:49:54.209]  Today at $29.97.
[03:49:54.789 --> 03:49:57.751]  That's more than 50% off, I believe.
[03:49:58.172 --> 03:50:02.455]  This is the example of the kind of products that you can get at InfoWars.
[03:50:02.555 --> 03:50:06.377]  And remember, this money doesn't go in Alex Jones's pocket.
[03:50:06.477 --> 03:50:15.784]  This money gets plowed back into InfoWars to help us fight the globalists and the fight against Internet censorship.
[03:50:16.164 --> 03:50:18.527]  We rely completely and totally on you.
[03:50:18.647 --> 03:50:21.550]  Please give us your loyal patronage at InfoWars.com.
[03:50:21.930 --> 03:50:23.251]  We will appreciate it.
[03:50:23.532 --> 03:50:30.699]  And as I often said, if you're not in the market for one of our great nutraceuticals, take a look at my book, Stone's Rules.
[03:50:30.919 --> 03:50:39.168]  Stone's Rules is a manifesto for victory, available now at the InfoWars.com site at a very special price.
[03:50:39.788 --> 03:50:59.731]  And in a special offering that we have only for Infowarriors and those who buy on the site, if you buy my new book, Stone's Rules, at the Infowars.com site, and if you mail it to me, I will gladly personalize it, sign it, and mail it back to you at my own expense.
[03:51:00.732 --> 03:51:12.659]  I know some people buy the book at Amazon or Barnes & Noble and that's all fine, but this offer is only for those who buy either at the Stone Cold Truth site or at the InfoWars site.
[03:51:12.699 --> 03:51:14.060]  And there you see the address.
[03:51:14.440 --> 03:51:21.785]  Get your copy of Stone's Rules at the InfoWars.com site and mail it to Roger Stone, P.O.
[03:51:21.845 --> 03:51:22.165]  Box 813450.
[03:51:25.967 --> 03:51:26.748]  Hollywood, FL 330-81-3450
[03:51:55.247 --> 03:51:55.687]  We're good to go.
[03:52:22.760 --> 03:52:24.341]  Over 200 stories.
[03:52:24.601 --> 03:52:32.943]  And as you saw earlier on the program, we have a record, a track record of beating the mainstream media to a number of major stories.
[03:52:33.363 --> 03:52:37.505]  We told you the presidential National Security Advisor, H.R.
[03:52:37.545 --> 03:52:38.825]  McMaster, was leaving.
[03:52:39.005 --> 03:52:40.606]  He left shortly thereafter.
[03:52:40.706 --> 03:52:43.428]  We told you that General John Kelly was leaving.
[03:52:43.488 --> 03:52:45.109]  He left shortly thereafter.
[03:52:45.509 --> 03:52:49.531]  We told you Michael Cohen was going to turn rat, and he did.
[03:52:49.651 --> 03:52:54.154]  Those are just examples of the things that we predicted ahead of the mainstream media.
[03:52:54.594 --> 03:52:59.797]  Now, in this particular case, I had a report here in which a few minor facts were wrong.
[03:53:00.433 --> 03:53:14.931]  But in the settlement, I said that I have never reported anything on any platform, including InfoWars or Stone Cold Truth or any other platform that I knew to be untrue at the time that I reported it.
[03:53:15.635 --> 03:53:22.979]  You see, what responsible journalists do when they make an error, major or minor, is they correct it and they retract.
[03:53:23.339 --> 03:53:26.201]  Because sometimes your sources are wrong.
[03:53:26.461 --> 03:53:33.885]  And in this case, my source, who I identified in the settlement as Sam Nunberg, gave me research that was incorrect.
[03:53:34.025 --> 03:53:40.149]  An incorrect reading of a Federal Election Commission document and other incorrect minor details.
[03:53:40.849 --> 03:53:47.853]  I issued an apology, but I never said that I spread lies on InfoWars.
[03:53:48.293 --> 03:53:55.036]  Even though you can find that in dozens of headlines, that's not what the settlement says, and that's not what I said.
[03:53:55.416 --> 03:53:59.138]  So what was the purpose of this character assassination?
[03:53:59.679 --> 03:54:01.179]  Well, here I think you say it.
[03:54:01.299 --> 03:54:03.661]  Here's a story from yesterday that blows your mind.
[03:54:03.981 --> 03:54:05.862]  Let me rewrite this headline for you.
[03:54:06.302 --> 03:54:08.443]  Roger Stone not indicted today.
[03:54:09.261 --> 03:54:15.643]  No action taken against me, so it's news now when I'm not bogusly charged by the special counsel.
[03:54:16.184 --> 03:54:18.985]  This is meant to put additional pressure on me.
[03:54:20.045 --> 03:54:38.392]  The setup saying that I peddled lies on InfoWars, something I never said and have never done, was the setup for stories generated through an insidious campaign of distortion and lies and disinformation by Congressman Adam Schiff
[03:54:38.939 --> 03:54:43.541]  I think Roger Stone lied to our committee and he had to send a number of letters amending his testimony.
[03:54:43.561 --> 03:54:44.502]  There are others like him.
[03:54:44.522 --> 03:54:47.804]  We just want to get those transcripts to Bob Mueller as soon as possible.
[03:55:08.630 --> 03:55:14.192]  So why not sign the other bills, though, so some of these workers can get paid, the government can get more... You think I should do that?
[03:55:14.232 --> 03:55:15.733]  I know, do you think I should do that, John?
[03:55:16.073 --> 03:55:16.834]  I mean, it's not for me to say.
[03:55:16.854 --> 03:55:18.274]  I mean, I watch your one-sided reporting.
[03:55:18.294 --> 03:55:19.315]  Do you think I should do that?
[03:55:19.335 --> 03:55:20.115]  Hey, John.
[03:55:20.435 --> 03:55:22.456]  No, seriously, John, do you think I should just sign?
[03:55:23.096 --> 03:55:24.637]  Well, the argument is... No, no, tell me, tell me.
[03:55:25.277 --> 03:55:27.959]  John, do you think I should just sign?
[03:55:29.000 --> 03:55:35.325]  I'm saying that if you sign that, these workers can start getting paid, the government can start... So you would do that, if you were in my position, you'd do that?
[03:55:35.485 --> 03:55:37.947]  I'm not in your position, I'm asking you if that's something you would do.
[03:55:37.967 --> 03:55:40.308]  I'm asking you, would you do that if you were in my position?
[03:55:40.949 --> 03:55:43.711]  Because if you would do that, you should never be in this position.
[03:55:44.772 --> 03:55:46.193]  Because you'd never get anything done.
[03:55:51.499 --> 03:55:53.921]  There's the Donald Trump that I love.
[03:55:54.021 --> 03:55:56.783]  That was the Donald Trump I didn't see last night.
[03:55:57.304 --> 03:56:03.368]  See, I thought the president was missing a certain spike, a certain spark, a certain vitality that I know he possesses.
[03:56:03.769 --> 03:56:04.589]  And there you saw it.
[03:56:04.990 --> 03:56:07.492]  Feisty, in your face, sticking to his guns.
[03:56:07.532 --> 03:56:08.953]  That's the Donald Trump I love.
[03:56:09.273 --> 03:56:11.255]  Let's go back to Eric Swalwell for a second.
[03:56:11.775 --> 03:56:14.377]  No, I never amended my testimony.
[03:56:14.517 --> 03:56:17.519]  I sent three supplementations to my testimony.
[03:56:17.800 --> 03:56:20.582]  One, I identified Randy Credico as the
[03:56:20.922 --> 03:56:21.142]  Sure.
[03:56:39.893 --> 03:56:41.974]  New York Times or Associated Press.
[03:56:42.154 --> 03:56:43.014]  I wonder why that is.
[03:56:43.394 --> 03:56:58.859]  Secondarily, I informed the committee that I was approached in May of 2016 prior to the time that the FBI says they opened their formal investigation into Donald Trump and Russian collusion by a man who was indisputably an FBI informant.
[03:56:59.159 --> 03:57:04.624]  Working for James Comey, a man who was only in the country on an informant's visa.
[03:57:04.864 --> 03:57:07.967]  And he attempted to compromise me and entrap Donald Trump.
[03:57:08.307 --> 03:57:11.350]  I turned him down flatly, but I informed the committee of that.
[03:57:11.430 --> 03:57:15.534]  And thirdly, I asked the committee to correct an error on their mistake.
[03:57:16.054 --> 03:57:28.166]  Uh, which they said in my iconic tweet, the Podesta's time in the barrel will come, they omitted the word the, trying to make it sound like I was talking about John Podesta, not two Podesta brothers.
[03:57:28.506 --> 03:57:37.235]  So I have just proven in a few short seconds that Eric Swalwell lies like a rug, and that I was the one telling the truth.
[03:57:37.715 --> 03:57:38.676]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:57:38.736 --> 03:57:40.417]  This has been the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:40.717 --> 03:57:44.960]  I'm great to have this opportunity to correct the record and ask you one more time.
[03:57:45.220 --> 03:57:47.462]  Go to TheInfoWars.com store now.
[03:57:47.802 --> 03:57:50.464]  Buy my book, Stone's Rules, or any of our great products.
[03:57:50.784 --> 03:57:52.085]  God will bless you for it.
[03:57:57.171 --> 03:58:00.453]  This is a solution for you and your family.
[03:58:00.773 --> 03:58:05.656]  This is something guaranteed, like oxygen and water, to sustain life.
[03:58:05.836 --> 03:58:07.557]  There are a bunch of bad halogens.
[03:58:07.657 --> 03:58:11.359]  There is one good halogen in the body, and it's pure atomic iodine.
[03:58:11.519 --> 03:58:13.521]  Most forms are bound, so you don't absorb them.
[03:58:13.581 --> 03:58:24.647]  But even microscopic amounts of the broken-down type are better than nothing, because your body recognizes it and takes it on, and tries to use it instead of bromine, chloride, fluorine, and the other bad ones.
[03:58:24.987 --> 03:58:27.608]  And there's a lot of things better than just wealth in this world.
[03:58:27.728 --> 03:58:28.849]  How about physical wealth?
[03:58:29.189 --> 03:58:31.230]  When I forget to pick my iodine, I'm an idiot.
[03:58:31.750 --> 03:58:32.811]  We have X2.
[03:58:32.891 --> 03:58:38.173]  It's selling out because a company tried to put me over the barrel from the oil well company that drills to get it at 12,000 feet.
[03:58:38.594 --> 03:58:40.134]  We ended up finding an even better company.
[03:58:40.314 --> 03:58:46.297]  Their chemist said, you can put this in the way you have it, but you should add a little bit of vitamin C to stabilize it so it doesn't oxidize.
[03:58:46.437 --> 03:58:47.878]  And this other form of iodine,
[03:58:47.998 --> 03:58:48.559]  We're good to go.
