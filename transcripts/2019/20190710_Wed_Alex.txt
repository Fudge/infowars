[00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:11.811]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:30.358]  What Facebook has done is so evil, so over the top, I don't have words to describe it.
[00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.501]  Paul Watson says they've issued a fatwa against him, myself, and others.
[00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:47.128]  If you're one of the individuals named as a dangerous person, Paul Watson, myself, and a few others have been, Facebook says that you're allowed to incite violence against them, dox their homes, and even kill them.
[00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:50.329]  It actually says, we want you to kill them.
[00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.831]  They say, kill them!
[00:00:53.976 --> 00:00:54.917]  Now, this is official.
[00:00:55.598 --> 00:01:02.708]  This is a country of 2.4 billion people in a giant mine control facility that Zuckerberg controls, and they're preparing a violent revolution.
[00:01:03.088 --> 00:01:04.510]  This is unspeakable.
[00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:06.473]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson's report on it.
[00:01:07.472 --> 00:01:09.174]  Facebook's a private company.
[00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:10.515]  It can do what it likes.
[00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:11.016]  Really?
[00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:13.398]  Can it issue fatwas against people?
[00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.020]  Because that's just what happened.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.302]  I'm not even joking.
[00:01:16.462 --> 00:01:24.831]  Facebook literally posted an update to its Community Standards Policy saying it's acceptable to incite violence against me.
[00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:26.312]  Yes, really.
[00:01:26.392 --> 00:01:32.818]  So as you know, when Facebook banned me back in May, they designated me a dangerous individual.
[00:01:32.898 --> 00:01:33.799]  So dangerous.
[00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:36.822]  And then yesterday, Facebook posted this.
[00:01:36.982 --> 00:01:45.230]  Do not post threats that could lead to death and other forms of high severity violence of any targets where threat is defined as any of the following.
[00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.095]  Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence or calls for high-severity violence.
[00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:59.025]  Unless the target is an organization or individual covered in the dangerous individuals and organizations policy.
[00:01:59.146 --> 00:01:59.826]  That's me!
[00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:10.472]  In other words, Facebook just informed its 2 billion users that it's acceptable to post statements of intent of high severity violence against me.
[00:02:10.592 --> 00:02:28.962]  This is literally illegal in the United Kingdom under the 1988 Malicious Communications Act which states, any person who sends to another person a letter, electronic communication or article of any description which conveys a threat is guilty of an offence.
[00:02:29.102 --> 00:02:31.325]  Facebook's a private company, it can do what it likes.
[00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:33.968]  Can it flagrantly break UK law?
[00:02:34.088 --> 00:02:37.292]  Can it openly incite violence against people?
[00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:48.966]  The largest social media company in the world with over 2 billion users says it's fine to incite violence against me despite this being totally illegal.
[00:02:49.226 --> 00:02:56.290]  The same company that lectures us all the time about the need to stop hate is directly encouraging hate.
[00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.115]  This is like some futuristic sci-fi dystopia where the artificial intelligence takes over and starts mocking people for elimination.
[00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:09.738]  Imagine a drone army of Mark Zuckerberg clones stomping on a human face forever.
[00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.880]  That's our collective future.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.540]  And I was human.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.541]  I am human.
[00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:13.801]  Still.
[00:03:19.158 --> 00:03:21.621]  They're painting a target on my back.
[00:03:21.861 --> 00:03:25.705]  I've already received dozens of death threats on Facebook over the years.
[00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:27.867]  Here, here, here, and here.
[00:03:27.987 --> 00:03:35.595]  The world's eighth biggest corporation has literally sanctioned death threats against me for words I say on the internet.
[00:03:35.655 --> 00:03:36.396]  Where does it go?
[00:03:36.656 --> 00:03:38.938]  Where can it possibly go from here?
[00:03:39.038 --> 00:03:42.740]  And what could I possibly be saying that represents such a threat to them?
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.921]  Seriously?
[00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:45.242]  Facebook's a private company.
[00:03:45.262 --> 00:03:47.563]  It can solicit death threats against whoever it wants.
[00:03:47.643 --> 00:03:49.205]  Let me be crystal clear.
[00:03:49.505 --> 00:03:58.891]  Facebook is literally telling its 2 billion users they can break the law and incite violence against anyone Facebook doesn't like.
[00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:04.215]  Facebook is so power-mad and out of control, it thinks it's above the law.
[00:04:04.835 --> 00:04:06.036]  Let that sink in.
[00:04:06.096 --> 00:04:07.657]  Facebook is evil.
[00:04:07.937 --> 00:04:08.837]  They spy on you.
[00:04:09.017 --> 00:04:10.198]  They sell your data.
[00:04:10.278 --> 00:04:11.899]  Facebook is a cult.
[00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:20.864]  They demand uniformity of opinion and punish anyone who strays outside their ghetto of acceptable opinion.
[00:04:20.884 --> 00:04:24.366]  38% of Brits have stopped using Facebook in the past year alone.
[00:04:24.486 --> 00:04:25.366]  And so should you.
[00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:28.388]  Delete your Facebook account right now.
[00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:29.789]  And I'm not going to reveal my hand,
[00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:35.873]  But this is Lawsuit City, and if you want to help me with that, the Subscribestar link is in the description.
[00:04:35.993 --> 00:04:39.856]  Oh, and that social media summit that begins at the White House today?
[00:04:39.936 --> 00:04:49.763]  Maybe the largest social media corporation on the planet issuing de facto fatwas against people for having the wrong political opinions should be part of the conversation.
[00:04:49.863 --> 00:04:50.483]  Just saying.
[00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:57.988]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:06.875]  The second American Revolution is happening now.
[00:05:07.215 --> 00:05:09.236]  It's worldwide against the globalists.
[00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:13.937]  The American system versus the anti-human, anti-God world government.
[00:05:14.537 --> 00:05:19.079]  Ladies and gentlemen, any war to be successful needs funding, and we make it easy.
[00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:23.640]  That's why we're launching our biggest sale yet, $17.76 worldwide.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.701]  Bigger than our Christmas specials.
[00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:31.903]  75% off is the best deals, with a lot of our best-selling items at that price, down to 25% off.
[00:05:34.105 --> 00:05:39.770]  And on top of it, we have a dozen items including all apparel for $17.76.
[00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:49.718]  So stock up and fund the M4 War today in the $17.76 worldwide special exclusively at m4warstore.com.
[00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.320]  I thank you for your support.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.061]  The Globalists hope you don't.
[00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:56.304]  Whatever you do, choose what side you're on and take action.
[00:06:07.682 --> 00:06:11.704]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:18.246]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:34.433]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:39.452 --> 00:06:44.957]  Online, making fun of members of Congress are a disgrace.
[00:06:45.797 --> 00:06:50.581]  And there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable.
[00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:57.226]  We're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted.
[00:06:57.867 --> 00:06:58.887]  I want them shut down.
[00:06:58.947 --> 00:06:59.888]  I want them silenced.
[00:06:59.908 --> 00:07:00.709]  I want them muted.
[00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:02.590]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:04.211]  Why are they doing this now?
[00:07:05.012 --> 00:07:09.117]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[00:07:10.218 --> 00:07:18.827]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:07:18.847 --> 00:07:23.833]  Now that they kicked him off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[00:07:24.113 --> 00:07:27.615]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:36.399]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say, you know, all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the Internet.
[00:07:36.859 --> 00:07:38.160]  I have no issue with it at all.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.440]  I want them shut down.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.421]  I want them silenced.
[00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:41.261]  I want them muted.
[00:07:41.281 --> 00:07:43.142]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:07:44.443 --> 00:07:45.803]  I want them shut down!
[00:07:45.823 --> 00:07:47.364]  I want them silenced!
[00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:48.164]  I want them muted!
[00:07:48.624 --> 00:07:49.325]  But don't worry.
[00:07:49.885 --> 00:07:51.606]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:08:01.388 --> 00:08:05.091]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have crossed the Rubicon.
[00:08:06.532 --> 00:08:07.533]  The point of no return.
[00:08:08.714 --> 00:08:23.766]  Facebook, in its terms of service, officially announced that their users can death-threat docks and even incite people until conservatives are dead.
[00:08:23.786 --> 00:08:28.951]  They officially say, you may organize people to commit murder
[00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:38.016]  Of anyone deemed a dangerous individual by the 2.4 billion slave mass controlled by Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:08:40.098 --> 00:08:41.499]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:41.819 --> 00:08:57.513]  And they also tell you when they send you the message, do not post, don't tell anyone that we're telling you inside this giant digital gulag, inside this giant digital re-education camp, that's what re-education camps are,
[00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.909]  That we're doing this.
[00:09:01.089 --> 00:09:03.410]  Now, Paul Watson's joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:08.571]  And he specifically saw these reports when he was being death-threatened.
[00:09:08.872 --> 00:09:11.072]  But this is anyone deemed a dangerous individual.
[00:09:11.352 --> 00:09:11.972]  Alex Jones.
[00:09:13.513 --> 00:09:14.593]  Milo Yiannopoulos.
[00:09:16.094 --> 00:09:16.734]  Paul Watson.
[00:09:17.614 --> 00:09:19.935]  And just a few others, like Louis Farrakhan.
[00:09:22.255 --> 00:09:28.077]  Wow, this is an amazing, amazing, amazing time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:30.094 --> 00:09:38.257]  And remember just a few months ago in May, it came out of the Atlantic who got a copy of the internal memorandums that are now public.
[00:09:38.857 --> 00:09:49.020]  They said you are not allowed to say Alex Jones's name or have Alex Jones's photo on Facebook or Instagram, owned by Facebook, unless you disparage him.
[00:09:50.661 --> 00:09:51.201]  And what happened?
[00:09:52.352 --> 00:10:01.699]  Caitlin Bennett got a message last week on July 4th that she would have her account suspended the next time an Alex Jones image or InfoWars image was posted.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:12.627]  She was wearing an American, she had an American flag in the background, wearing an InfoWars.com red, white, and blue shirt.
[00:10:16.673 --> 00:10:18.976]  And then I had Leo Zagami here last week.
[00:10:19.796 --> 00:10:21.638]  He took a photo of himself with me.
[00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:22.980]  He posted it on Instagram.
[00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:25.383]  Instagram terminated his account.
[00:10:25.763 --> 00:10:27.004]  Now that was just in May.
[00:10:29.187 --> 00:10:31.109]  He who shall not be named Alex Jones.
[00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:32.731]  Now they're expanding it out to everyone.
[00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:38.517]  This is the social credit score and now they're telling you
[00:10:39.878 --> 00:10:44.962]  That they can engage in violence against you.
[00:10:45.002 --> 00:10:51.507]  Let's put Paul Watson's video back up in his article, please, that has screenshots of all of this.
[00:10:52.368 --> 00:10:54.610]  Facebook put a fatwa on me.
[00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.012]  That's when the Muslims order you dead.
[00:10:57.032 --> 00:11:01.876]  And then let's put Paul's article from last night up.
[00:11:02.656 --> 00:11:09.242]  It's on Infowars.com, where he lays all of this out.
[00:11:13.806 --> 00:11:18.390]  Facebook issues new policy saying it's acceptable to post death threats against me.
[00:11:19.871 --> 00:11:20.531]  Yes, really.
[00:11:20.591 --> 00:11:21.652]  Continuing scrolling down.
[00:11:22.052 --> 00:11:23.113]  Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:11:24.014 --> 00:11:40.747]  Facebook has issued a new policy update saying it's acceptable to post death threats to incite violence against me or anyone else designated dangerous despite it being a crime in the United Kingdom.
[00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:43.279]  No, I'm not joking.
[00:11:43.939 --> 00:12:02.370]  A Community Standards Update published by Facebook states, emphasis mine, do not post threats that could lead to death and other forms of high severity violence or any target where the threat is defined as any of the following.
[00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:10.755]  Statements of intent to commit high severity violence or calls for high severity violence unless a target
[00:12:11.932 --> 00:12:19.595]  Is an organization or individual covered in the dangerous individuals and organizations policy?
[00:12:21.376 --> 00:12:26.938]  And then they go on to say, then you can make threats that are designed to cause serious harm or death.
[00:12:27.738 --> 00:12:28.418]  Did you hear that?
[00:12:29.239 --> 00:12:36.101]  I talked to five lawyers this morning, famous, well-known lawyers that called me panting.
[00:12:36.902 --> 00:12:39.483]  One of them said, can you talk to Alan Dershowitz later this afternoon?
[00:12:39.543 --> 00:12:40.403]  He wants to talk to you.
[00:12:43.257 --> 00:12:45.118]  And they said, no one can believe this.
[00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:49.240]  They are like the Nazis, organizing to kill people.
[00:12:50.141 --> 00:12:51.241]  This is so illegal.
[00:12:52.382 --> 00:12:57.645]  But see, Facebook already said, May 1st, they said, you cannot post Alex Jones or Infowars.
[00:12:57.685 --> 00:12:59.345]  He is the most dangerous category.
[00:12:59.386 --> 00:13:04.008]  He has his own category, above even Paul Watson or Louis Farrakhan or all these other people.
[00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.571]  And they said, Gavin McGinnis, you name it.
[00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:11.432]  He's the most dangerous, Alex Jones.
[00:13:12.688 --> 00:13:14.809]  And they said, if you post anything positive, you'll be banned.
[00:13:14.909 --> 00:13:17.649]  You can only disparage him or tear him down.
[00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:18.550]  Read the policies.
[00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:19.310]  I'll read it to you in a moment.
[00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.510]  Show you the actual policy.
[00:13:21.871 --> 00:13:22.751]  Oh, it's a private company.
[00:13:23.271 --> 00:13:32.394]  Could I, as a private company with 2.4 billion users, claiming that I have Section 230 immunity because they're third parties posting, tell them I want you to attack somebody?
[00:13:32.854 --> 00:13:40.456]  Or I'll let you death threat people and organize people to kill them if they're Alex Jones.
[00:13:41.923 --> 00:13:42.964]  Or Paul Joseph Watson?
[00:13:44.505 --> 00:13:50.029]  And I'm glad Paul wrote this article, I'm glad he caught this, but Paul's a smart guy, but he's making it about how it's him.
[00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.951]  Well then that'll just be what?
[00:13:53.031 --> 00:13:56.894]  No, it's the policy towards anyone they designate.
[00:13:58.616 --> 00:14:05.141]  And the way authoritarians work is, first they designate a few dozen people, then they designate a few thousand, and then they just start doing it.
[00:14:05.201 --> 00:14:07.943]  This is the global social credit score.
[00:14:10.506 --> 00:14:12.827]  This is the reality of this system.
[00:14:13.107 --> 00:14:14.468]  This is what's been launched.
[00:14:14.768 --> 00:14:15.908]  This is what they're doing.
[00:14:16.248 --> 00:14:21.831]  And Trump, tomorrow, is having his social media conference.
[00:14:23.091 --> 00:14:29.334]  And every person going there, I know a lot of them, I'm gonna get on the phone today and say, listen, this isn't about me.
[00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:35.857]  And I'm gonna article rewritten about how Facebook says conservatives can be killed.
[00:14:36.638 --> 00:14:38.759]  And the promotion of killing conservatives is kosher.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.160]  Because I'm telling you how the media works.
[00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:44.363]  They're going to pick this up and say, oh, they're saying you can kill Paul Watson.
[00:14:44.823 --> 00:14:46.264]  And then they'll go, oh, that's OK.
[00:14:46.565 --> 00:14:51.548]  No, they're saying whoever Facebook designates, then people can commit crime.
[00:14:51.788 --> 00:14:55.630]  Facebook doesn't have the authorization to tell people they can commit crimes.
[00:14:56.011 --> 00:15:05.377]  Under Section 230, the only things they have to remove are people calling for violence, or organizing it, and naming names, and telling people to kill somebody.
[00:15:06.673 --> 00:15:10.800]  Or selling drugs, or illegal pornography, or gambling.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.662]  It was regulated in that country.
[00:15:12.983 --> 00:15:13.504]  That's it!
[00:15:14.906 --> 00:15:17.810]  The Digital Millennium Copyright, Safe Harbor Act, all of it.
[00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.591]  I know the law.
[00:15:19.072 --> 00:15:20.654]  I run a multimedia operations.
[00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:27.874]  But they're saying, no, in this gulag, you can target these people and get promoted.
[00:15:27.894 --> 00:15:30.375]  And that's why the media all attacks me and lies about me.
[00:15:30.536 --> 00:15:36.600]  And why AP said that I lost a Sandy Hook lawsuit for a book I've never read, saying I wrote it.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.562]  Or why they said I'm sending child porn out when I'm not.
[00:15:39.882 --> 00:15:43.965]  Because they know they're protected and they've been given orders by the deep state to go for broke.
[00:15:44.225 --> 00:15:45.345]  And what does this signify?
[00:15:45.826 --> 00:15:47.387]  They're getting ready for a violent revolution.
[00:15:47.847 --> 00:15:49.488]  Antifa is their operating system.
[00:15:49.948 --> 00:15:51.449]  The media is run by Antifa.
[00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.070]  Big Tech is
[00:15:52.931 --> 00:15:53.851]  In bed with Antifa.
[00:15:54.512 --> 00:15:55.152]  You understand?
[00:15:55.172 --> 00:15:57.855]  This is Antifa getting ready to make their move.
[00:15:58.015 --> 00:15:59.176]  They're gonna kill thousands.
[00:15:59.216 --> 00:16:00.157]  They're coming to kill you.
[00:16:02.779 --> 00:16:06.041]  Hi, I'm... Pomp, pageantry, and armored tanks.
[00:16:06.402 --> 00:16:10.305]  President Trump creates a different kind of fireworks this 4th of July.
[00:16:10.505 --> 00:16:15.889]  In recent years, 4th of July on the National Mall has been a tribute to universal American themes.
[00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:21.054]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, a star-spangled civic hymn.
[00:16:23.007 --> 00:16:25.708]  This year, by design, it will be much more about him.
[00:16:26.848 --> 00:16:27.288]  Confirmed.
[00:16:27.469 --> 00:16:32.050]  President Trump has decided that this year, the 4th of July, should be for him.
[00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.431]  This is a celebration of our nation's history.
[00:16:35.471 --> 00:16:39.853]  It is not a celebration of any particular individual, including him.
[00:16:39.953 --> 00:16:40.833]  I don't think he understands.
[00:16:40.873 --> 00:16:42.914]  This is America's birthday, not his birthday.
[00:16:42.934 --> 00:16:44.594]  This is why the word hijacked is being used.
[00:16:44.614 --> 00:16:48.576]  Donald Trump has hijacked the nation's previously nonpartisan 4th of July celebration.
[00:16:48.596 --> 00:16:52.517]  That effort to hijack July 4th for his own purposes did not go well.
[00:16:52.757 --> 00:16:59.828]  Using patriotism and the military as political props has hijacked a day that should unify Americans.
[00:16:59.988 --> 00:17:04.134]  But it's safe to say unifying Americans is not one of Trump's core talents.
[00:17:08.681 --> 00:17:09.522]  Totally improper.
[00:17:09.602 --> 00:17:10.702]  It's just obscene.
[00:17:10.762 --> 00:17:12.123]  And the speech is going to be dreadful.
[00:17:12.143 --> 00:17:17.686]  They're going to have their Confederate flags flying and their license plates and all kinds of troublemaking.
[00:17:17.826 --> 00:17:18.507]  Well, let's see.
[00:17:18.527 --> 00:17:19.367]  Let me be subtle here.
[00:17:19.387 --> 00:17:22.629]  At a professional level, 25 years in national security, I hated it.
[00:17:22.749 --> 00:17:24.610]  At a personal level, I hated it more.
[00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.233]  I've decided Washington is going to have a party on the 4th of July.
[00:17:29.253 --> 00:17:35.737]  There will be big parades with floats using a new invention of mine.
[00:17:38.424 --> 00:17:40.766]  This should not be a political event.
[00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:44.390]  Nothing about 4th of July should be reduced to politics.
[00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.792]  But he's putting himself at the center of this.
[00:17:46.852 --> 00:17:51.396]  He is, by all accounts, the most polarizing president in modern history.
[00:17:51.496 --> 00:17:59.883]  And simply by his presence, standing in front of one of our most cherished monuments, makes this a very controversial decision.
[00:17:59.923 --> 00:18:00.904]  There's no need for this.
[00:18:01.064 --> 00:18:04.386]  I mean we've celebrated America on 4th of July pretty well.
[00:18:05.546 --> 00:18:14.292]  I think in part this is about a president who's deeply insecure and this is a bit of sort of phony toughness that we've seen out of him.
[00:18:14.312 --> 00:18:17.774]  Sure looks like a partisan re-election rally on public space.
[00:18:18.074 --> 00:18:23.517]  Donald Trump's campaign rally in Washington paid for by the American taxpayer.
[00:18:23.537 --> 00:18:24.638]  A campaign event.
[00:18:24.918 --> 00:18:26.259]  Some kind of a campaign speech.
[00:18:26.339 --> 00:18:27.260]  A political rally.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.121]  Partisan event.
[00:18:28.181 --> 00:18:34.926]  Combination Trump rally and Kim Jong-un style military parade.
[00:18:34.966 --> 00:18:41.071]  The president's vision bears a closer resemblance to the chest-thumping displays put on by authoritarian regimes.
[00:18:41.091 --> 00:18:45.775]  This is the kind of military display that we were used to seeing from the Soviet Union.
[00:18:45.815 --> 00:18:49.177]  I also have some concerns about a president
[00:18:49.998 --> 00:18:55.702]  Not celebrating the military, but glorifying military might.
[00:18:56.322 --> 00:18:57.803]  That scares me the most.
[00:18:58.064 --> 00:19:00.846]  I'm just troubled about the militaristic tone of this whole thing.
[00:19:00.886 --> 00:19:04.188]  This reminds me of parades I used to attend in the Soviet Union.
[00:19:04.548 --> 00:19:06.730]  Not the right look for the 4th.
[00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:12.494]  Americans love our freedom and no one will ever take it away from us.
[00:19:14.662 --> 00:19:19.064]  Those words sparking criticism that the president has taken over D.C.'
[00:19:19.004 --> 00:19:21.605]  's 4th of July celebration on the National Mall.
[00:19:21.685 --> 00:19:24.167]  Because the American people are being co-opted into this.
[00:19:24.207 --> 00:19:25.027]  This is their day.
[00:19:25.087 --> 00:19:32.691]  This is the day for America and for every American and yet the American people are being somewhat against their will.
[00:19:32.791 --> 00:19:37.113]  Some of them who are just coming here for the fireworks co-opted to be a part of this.
[00:19:37.153 --> 00:19:39.674]  The nation's birthday is being politicized.
[00:19:40.034 --> 00:19:52.280]  Devotion to our founding ideals led American patriots to abolish the evil of slavery, secure civil rights, and expand the blessings of liberty to all Americans.
[00:20:06.547 --> 00:20:09.209]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:33.435 --> 00:20:40.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we knew the left was pushing for a hot war.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:43.943]  You've got all these members of Congress calling for the arrest of conservatives for our speech.
[00:20:45.256 --> 00:20:59.600]  Facebook, in its official terms of service, has now called for its users to call for the murder of conservatives and others, to call for violence, to call for organized targeting.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.461]  They say you're not allowed to do that unless it's someone listed as a dangerous individual.
[00:21:04.481 --> 00:21:14.384]  And when you're listed as a dangerous individual by Facebook, in the hate designation, then your name is not allowed to be spoken in a positive way, your photo cannot be posted,
[00:21:15.353 --> 00:21:22.575]  Your website not posted, total Chinese social score beyond 94, beyond a Black Mirror episode, unless you disparage them.
[00:21:23.195 --> 00:21:30.437]  So organized criminal bullying by the 2.4 billion members.
[00:21:31.097 --> 00:21:34.878]  This is terrorism against the American people.
[00:21:35.578 --> 00:21:43.780]  And this is what happens when our government hasn't protected us and allows the Communist Chinese and the EU and others to come in and put in regulations
[00:21:44.898 --> 00:21:52.664]  So that Facebook and Google and Apple can move to China, and then by extension we go under the Chinese social credit score.
[00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:55.727]  Let me read to you from the Atlantic Magazine two months ago.
[00:21:55.927 --> 00:21:56.868]  Then I'll get to the new developments.
[00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:00.531]  Any content.
[00:22:00.571 --> 00:22:01.392]  This is from Facebook.
[00:22:02.315 --> 00:22:02.735]  We're good to go.
[00:22:29.093 --> 00:22:35.919]  And they're all linking up and then saying, oh, we better get rid of Paul Watson, which they now have, or we better get rid of other people.
[00:22:36.279 --> 00:22:38.481]  They are just copycats of Jones.
[00:22:38.841 --> 00:22:40.363]  You know, they believe in Second Amendment.
[00:22:40.623 --> 00:22:41.744]  They believe in two genders.
[00:22:41.984 --> 00:22:42.885]  They believe in borders.
[00:22:43.085 --> 00:22:44.426]  They believe in free market.
[00:22:44.466 --> 00:22:47.689]  They believe in the right to live your life as you see fit.
[00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.912]  And the authoritarians can't put up with that.
[00:22:51.972 --> 00:22:56.977]  Well, now, ladies and gentlemen, what have they done?
[00:22:57.912 --> 00:23:03.457]  The article's up on Infowars.com, Newswars.com, and PaulSitesSummit.news.
[00:23:05.338 --> 00:23:09.121]  Facebook issues new policy saying it's acceptable to post death threats against me.
[00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:10.503]  They've issued a fatwa.
[00:23:11.143 --> 00:23:11.984]  That's what the Muslims do.
[00:23:12.004 --> 00:23:15.787]  They say, we're not going to charge you if you kill this person.
[00:23:16.127 --> 00:23:17.248]  In fact, we're going to promote you.
[00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:24.594]  And they say, oh, you can't organize people or dox them or call for violence unless it's someone we've listed as a dangerous individual.
[00:23:24.614 --> 00:23:26.156]  Remember three months ago.
[00:23:28.387 --> 00:23:36.611]  Business Insider got internal email communications with Facebook executives saying, well, we haven't found Jones doing anything anti-Semitic.
[00:23:37.311 --> 00:23:42.314]  And we scanned all the comments on his pages and 4% were anti-Semitic.
[00:23:43.895 --> 00:23:46.656]  It has to be 30%, which is still police state weirdness.
[00:23:47.517 --> 00:23:50.698]  Obviously, the Shills can go on there and do it themselves, a bunch of Jussie Smollett-ing.
[00:23:51.779 --> 00:23:54.080]  They said, but if we designate him as a hate figure,
[00:23:56.095 --> 00:23:58.696]  See, they hadn't rolled that policy out, so they go, oh, let's do that!
[00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:00.277]  And so they did.
[00:24:03.698 --> 00:24:06.640]  And when they did it, they said it was for anti-Semitism.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:07.820]  Wow.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:18.905]  If you don't like George Soros funding open borders, and he happens to be Jewish, doesn't matter, he helped round up his fellow Jews in World War II, you are bad.
[00:24:19.785 --> 00:24:23.327]  Wow, talk about the country that defeated Hitler.
[00:24:25.652 --> 00:24:43.666]  And now the grandsons and people of the folks that flew B-17s over Germany and almost died, quote my grandfathers, I get to have weirdo billionaire Jewish guys have me silent saying I'm anti-Semitic, and then the weirdo billionaire Jewish guy actually worked for Hitler.
[00:24:44.827 --> 00:24:46.468]  It's all part of the sick joke, isn't it?
[00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:50.612]  Do not post threats that could lead to death,
[00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:58.918]  And other forms of high-severity violence of any targets where the threat is defined as any of the following.
[00:24:59.399 --> 00:25:09.751]  Statements of intent to commit high-severity violence or calls for high-severity violence unless the target is an organization or individual covered in the dangerous individuals and organizations policy.
[00:25:11.847 --> 00:25:28.392]  So they're saying, wow, you're not even supposed to call for violence or say kill somebody who's a wanted murderer.
[00:25:29.112 --> 00:25:30.732]  You can say, I hope they get the electric chair.
[00:25:31.192 --> 00:25:39.134]  This is saying, if we call you dangerous, don't have a crime, haven't committed a crime, that's in with child molesters or murderers, see?
[00:25:39.775 --> 00:25:40.655]  See, it's a death sentence.
[00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:47.652]  And so they're saying, if you're one of these dangerous individuals, which they've listed me as, well now you can call for their death.
[00:25:50.593 --> 00:25:52.813]  Now you can go out and kill them.
[00:25:52.873 --> 00:25:58.595]  But see, when you do go out and kill somebody, you're gonna end up going to prison.
[00:25:59.315 --> 00:26:08.078]  But see, Antifa is operated and is staffed and is commanded by government employees, academics,
[00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:15.473]  And others, and the main funder is Alexander Soros, who spent billions, that's public knowledge, towards Soros' son.
[00:26:16.013 --> 00:26:16.673]  He's taken over.
[00:26:18.715 --> 00:26:21.116]  And so they're creating the policies for Silicon Valley.
[00:26:21.276 --> 00:26:23.418]  That's why you can never talk bad about Antifa, they'll ban you.
[00:26:24.758 --> 00:26:32.243]  And so Antifa is now setting the policy saying, when we list you as a Nazi, it's okay to kill a Nazi, not just punch a Nazi.
[00:26:33.888 --> 00:26:38.189]  So they have CBS News shows about go out and hit white people.
[00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:40.730]  Go out and hit people that support Trump.
[00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:41.910]  They're all Nazis.
[00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.470]  They dehumanize you.
[00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:45.611]  They list you as an enemy.
[00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:56.253]  They have all these photos and graphics of stabbing Americans with Make America Great Again hats to death with bayonets saying, we beat them before, we can beat them again.
[00:26:56.933 --> 00:26:59.634]  But they're actually financed by a real live Nazi, George Soros.
[00:27:01.212 --> 00:27:04.878]  CBS drama The Good Fight also said assassinate the president.
[00:27:05.118 --> 00:27:10.005]  They didn't just say go and punch a Trump supporter.
[00:27:11.049 --> 00:27:12.150]  But see, here's the good thing about it.
[00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:13.911]  You're not going to get our guns.
[00:27:14.091 --> 00:27:15.972]  The Second Amendment's here for when these things happen.
[00:27:16.193 --> 00:27:18.394]  We're not going to offensively come after you, trash.
[00:27:18.995 --> 00:27:19.895]  But here's what's going to happen.
[00:27:20.616 --> 00:27:21.396]  You can't help it.
[00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:23.378]  We're culturally taking things back.
[00:27:23.678 --> 00:27:24.899]  We're turning the country back on.
[00:27:25.239 --> 00:27:26.400]  Trump's ending the corruption.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.723]  He's even getting rid of the ethanol subsidies to corn growers, which is a total scam.
[00:27:31.003 --> 00:27:33.285]  Trump is, for real, straight shooting.
[00:27:34.005 --> 00:27:36.247]  And the big megabanks think they're going to activate
[00:27:38.112 --> 00:27:42.453]  A bunch of people on the streets and others who go out and carry out violence and start a civil war.
[00:27:42.833 --> 00:27:53.676]  I assure you, Alexander Soros, George Soros, the Democratic Party, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, all of you calling for violence, Joe Biden saying it's time for a physical revolution.
[00:27:54.016 --> 00:28:02.118]  I swear on the altar of God, because I know, you sow the wind, you're going to reap the whirlwind.
[00:28:02.438 --> 00:28:04.779]  You are sticking your leg in a bear trap.
[00:28:05.871 --> 00:28:08.132]  You're climbing into a wood chipper and flipping the switch on.
[00:28:08.232 --> 00:28:08.832]  You're doing it!
[00:28:09.632 --> 00:28:10.233]  You're doing it!
[00:28:10.573 --> 00:28:18.015]  You're the one that silences us, or tries, and then lies about us and demonizes us, and then says, kill us!
[00:28:18.495 --> 00:28:19.756]  It always goes the same.
[00:28:20.476 --> 00:28:23.977]  Silence someone, lie about them and demonize them, kill them.
[00:28:26.098 --> 00:28:31.420]  Silence them, lie about them, imprison them, kill them.
[00:28:32.534 --> 00:28:39.095]  Of course, most of the time, especially in the country and people of any history of fighting back, you get your asses handed to you.
[00:28:39.555 --> 00:28:44.416]  You're not trying to carry this out in countries that didn't have a history of freedom.
[00:28:44.476 --> 00:28:47.397]  You are out of your crazy minds.
[00:28:47.417 --> 00:28:52.058]  But hey, you're going to find out your San Francisco bubbles real soon, Froggy.
[00:28:52.078 --> 00:28:56.219]  Because like they say in Tombstone, I'll be your Huckleberry.
[00:28:56.879 --> 00:29:01.620]  InfoWars.com, steaming straight into the enemy attack fleet and winning thanks to your support.
[00:29:10.814 --> 00:29:14.996]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:29:16.017 --> 00:29:18.518]  To prosecute wars takes a lot of money.
[00:29:19.899 --> 00:29:28.984]  And if you look at the communists, they'll rob banks, they'll sell children to sex slavery, they'll hold people ransom for money for the revolutions.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.521]  But that's not how our founding fathers did it.
[00:29:33.621 --> 00:29:37.822]  They just robbed British gold shipments and killed people.
[00:29:38.502 --> 00:29:39.963]  We're not doing any of that.
[00:29:40.423 --> 00:29:47.445]  We're just selling t-shirts and books and films and air filtration and non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[00:29:47.605 --> 00:29:50.986]  A general store of high quality products at great prices.
[00:29:52.126 --> 00:29:53.947]  And so, we have our new special.
[00:29:54.947 --> 00:29:57.348]  And it is the biggest special we've ever had.
[00:29:58.615 --> 00:30:01.076]  The last special we had was basically Christmas in July.
[00:30:01.736 --> 00:30:02.936]  It's the best specials we do.
[00:30:02.956 --> 00:30:05.516]  50% off, free shipping, stuff like that.
[00:30:06.237 --> 00:30:14.738]  This new special, if you take advantage of all the sales that are there, is 75% off more than 30 items.
[00:30:15.879 --> 00:30:17.359]  The average item is 50% off.
[00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:23.700]  So the sale runs the gambit, the gauntlet, from 75% off to 25% off.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.541]  And there's a bunch of other specials too.
[00:30:26.381 --> 00:30:27.481]  A dozen items.
[00:30:29.204 --> 00:30:29.344]  Our 1776.
[00:30:31.385 --> 00:30:35.867]  Some of these items retail for $50 and we've never sold them for this price.
[00:30:36.728 --> 00:30:37.388]  But it's true.
[00:30:37.508 --> 00:30:39.369]  I've habituated the audience to big sales.
[00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:41.930]  And the audience is smart.
[00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:47.993]  They know, wow, these are really good deals on the air filtration, the water filtration, the seeds, the supplements.
[00:30:48.674 --> 00:30:49.194]  Here's an example.
[00:30:50.638 --> 00:30:55.160]  Nobody ever put $15 plus into a turmeric formula.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:02.863]  Our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula has at least $15 a product in it, not counting shipping and marketing, everything goes in the cost.
[00:31:03.644 --> 00:31:05.604]  The leading competitor puts $5 in the bottle.
[00:31:05.985 --> 00:31:10.707]  It's the strongest turmeric extract with all the other key co-enzymes.
[00:31:11.247 --> 00:31:13.368]  If you don't know about turmeric, you need to learn about it.
[00:31:13.388 --> 00:31:14.868]  If you don't know about Body's, you should find out about it.
[00:31:15.129 --> 00:31:16.409]  That's one product.
[00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:18.150]  And ladies and gentlemen,
[00:31:19.122 --> 00:31:22.123]  It is the highest discount we've ever offered on it.
[00:31:23.123 --> 00:31:24.043]  75% off.
[00:31:25.964 --> 00:31:27.164]  It's just crazy.
[00:31:27.584 --> 00:31:30.205]  Infowarsstore.com is the main site.
[00:31:30.605 --> 00:31:33.785]  Infowarslife.com is the supplement area.
[00:31:33.805 --> 00:31:34.866]  It takes you right to that.
[00:31:35.346 --> 00:31:40.147]  And in celebration of the amazing victories we're having against tyranny, we're having the 17th
[00:31:41.027 --> 00:31:45.268]  This is a 1776 worldwide sale that we are just launching.
[00:31:46.069 --> 00:31:49.850]  And a lot of these products like X2 are on the verge of selling out, Brain Force and things.
[00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:59.353]  But whether it's Winter Sun or Icarin or Bio PCA or Floralife or Gut Fusion, all shirts and hats, including the new Betsy Ross 1776.
[00:32:01.434 --> 00:32:03.475]  ...are also discounted for $17.76.
[00:32:03.836 --> 00:32:08.198]  So everything is on sale, okay?
[00:32:08.558 --> 00:32:12.020]  At InfowarsStore.com, and that's how we fund this operation.
[00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:18.564]  And again, I can't tell you about all the initiatives we're involved in because when my name's on it, the enemy tries to shut it down.
[00:32:19.065 --> 00:32:19.785]  You already understand that.
[00:32:20.065 --> 00:32:24.228]  But what you see visibly at Infowars is the tip of the iceberg.
[00:32:25.435 --> 00:32:31.277]  There's a giant mountain under the water, and we are doing amazing things thanks to your support.
[00:32:31.537 --> 00:32:45.283]  There is nowhere on Earth where you can financially invest, get great products back, and know that you are fueling an explosive zeitgeist that has the globalists literally quaking in their filthy boots.
[00:32:46.383 --> 00:32:48.344]  Take action now, 1776 worldwide, at MFORESTORE.com.
[00:32:53.743 --> 00:33:01.852]  Take action now, 75% off, down to 25% off, $17.76 on a dozen best-selling items at infoorestore.com.
[00:33:02.212 --> 00:33:02.913]  Thank you for watching.
[00:33:06.056 --> 00:33:08.659]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.649 --> 00:33:17.570]  Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:19.051]  I am now completely banned.
[00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:23.073]  Now, InfoWars, of course, is that web show and website led by rageaholic Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.353 --> 00:33:24.393]  I want them shut down.
[00:33:24.453 --> 00:33:25.373]  I want them silenced.
[00:33:25.413 --> 00:33:26.194]  I want them muted.
[00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:28.074]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:33:28.114 --> 00:33:29.675]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:35.841]  But there's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[00:33:35.941 --> 00:33:42.867]  These are very extreme individuals, and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists, and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[00:33:42.947 --> 00:33:46.691]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous, is what Facebook is saying.
[00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:50.054]  Those individuals include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:33:50.294 --> 00:34:03.800]  Organizations like Media Matters have pointed out consistently how Alex Jones and other InfoWars pages had just simply circumvented any ban by starting a different account or going on Instagram.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.041]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them.
[00:34:06.482 --> 00:34:08.102]  It's not that hard to figure out.
[00:34:08.162 --> 00:34:11.184]  Facebook, are you gonna do something about the liberals who call me the n-word?
[00:34:11.804 --> 00:34:16.126]  No, because Big Tech is only interested in going after conservatives.
[00:34:16.146 --> 00:34:17.487]  You know, the really dangerous ones.
[00:34:17.527 --> 00:34:20.669]  Dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[00:34:20.789 --> 00:34:23.330]  President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice.
[00:34:23.471 --> 00:34:25.832]  And a brief video by InfoWars' Millie Weaver.
[00:34:25.872 --> 00:34:29.934]  Social media's hall monitor, Brad Spelter, was not very happy about it.
[00:34:29.974 --> 00:34:33.156]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as InfoWars.
[00:34:33.336 --> 00:34:42.758]  Back to your point, though, about the InfoWars presidency, I want to know, and I tweeted this the other day, what is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[00:34:43.138 --> 00:34:45.219]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:48.179]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[00:34:48.479 --> 00:34:49.500]  I want them shut down.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.480]  I want them silenced.
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.220]  I want them muted.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.200]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.661]  I want them shut down!
[00:34:54.681 --> 00:34:56.201]  I want them silenced!
[00:34:56.221 --> 00:34:57.021]  I want them muted!
[00:34:57.621 --> 00:34:58.181]  Don't worry.
[00:34:58.762 --> 00:35:00.462]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:35:01.818 --> 00:35:06.922]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:35:06.982 --> 00:35:23.855]  I'm gonna say something that is as critical as it gets.
[00:35:24.396 --> 00:35:30.761]  If you want to live in a free country and not be a slave of the nastiest, most evil control freaks the planet's ever seen.
[00:35:32.418 --> 00:35:47.987]  Tyrants and corrupt political systems test things, and they push slowly and incrementally, and they'll see what you'll put up with, and they'll pick certain individuals and certain groups that they've demonized to then target and take their rights away.
[00:35:49.168 --> 00:35:53.231]  And then once they've taken those people's rights away, they take everybody's rights away.
[00:35:54.211 --> 00:36:00.015]  All this Facebook and Google and YouTube and Twitter censorship is about taking all your rights away.
[00:36:00.973 --> 00:36:09.619]  And it's about if you don't say and do what they want, they have a social credit score and take your bank account away or take your job away or not let you travel.
[00:36:09.859 --> 00:36:11.400]  They admit that's the plan.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:19.785]  We told you seven years ago about this at InfoWars.com on this show and articles that Paul Joseph Watson wrote.
[00:36:21.206 --> 00:36:30.472]  Now, a year ago, they listed me as a evil person and worked to be platforming off of dozens of systems.
[00:36:32.017 --> 00:36:40.079]  Then, a few months ago, they said, you can't even say nice things about Alex Jones or Paul Watson or just a few other people.
[00:36:40.299 --> 00:36:41.719]  We call them dangerous individuals.
[00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:50.661]  Now they have said that people can call for violence and organize violence that's intended to kill us.
[00:36:51.541 --> 00:36:52.901]  I read the quotes from it.
[00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:54.162]  This is official policy.
[00:36:54.842 --> 00:36:55.962]  This is Antifa.
[00:36:56.422 --> 00:36:57.642]  That's who runs Silicon Valley.
[00:36:57.762 --> 00:36:58.662]  That's why they're so protected.
[00:36:59.363 --> 00:37:01.003]  Big media, Antifa, all of them.
[00:37:03.083 --> 00:37:11.191]  Paul Joseph Watson discovered this, and discovered that they're allowing death threats against him, and specifically said, no, you're allowed to, he's a bad man.
[00:37:12.472 --> 00:37:15.155]  Well, that violates UK law, it violates US law.
[00:37:15.535 --> 00:37:21.341]  I had five lawyers call me this morning, high-powered ones, and say, we've never heard of something like this.
[00:37:23.663 --> 00:37:37.257]  They said this is incitement to violence, it's organized crime, and it's implying that you can commit crimes and not get in trouble, and it violates Section 230 because they're saying that, well, we're not a publisher, we don't control content, but they're going further.
[00:37:37.518 --> 00:37:41.001]  This is the type of content that under Section 230 you do have to remove.
[00:37:41.422 --> 00:37:42.163]  Threats of violence.
[00:37:44.724 --> 00:37:54.628]  So Paul Watson joins us for the next two segments, then Roger Stone's got the inside baseball on Jeffrey Epstein, and this whole house of cards coming down fast that's gonna bring down the Democrats.
[00:37:54.688 --> 00:37:55.169]  You watch.
[00:37:56.409 --> 00:37:58.290]  And so much more.
[00:37:59.611 --> 00:38:04.853]  We also have some other critical intel I haven't gotten to yet, but Paul, I gotta tell ya.
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:06.360]  Well...
[00:38:25.831 --> 00:38:30.096]  Nothing really shocks me at this point but there are a few things that give you pause for thought.
[00:38:30.576 --> 00:38:37.163]  I originally saw it on some different independent media reports websites and I thought surely that can't be the case.
[00:38:37.223 --> 00:38:42.970]  Surely they wouldn't legitimize inciting what they call high severity violence
[00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:46.952]  Against me, against you, against Milo Yiannopoulos, against Laura Loomer.
[00:38:47.373 --> 00:38:49.474]  And yes, it's right there on their website.
[00:38:49.774 --> 00:38:55.258]  I thought, well, maybe after the backlash this morning, they'll rework it, they'll change it.
[00:38:55.318 --> 00:38:58.360]  But no, it's still there and it's still going to be there.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:09.567]  And it states that if somebody is a dangerous individual, which you and I are now, according to Facebook, with no evidence, they just decided that, that it's acceptable to post
[00:39:10.259 --> 00:39:15.408]  Threats of and intent to commit high severity violence against us.
[00:39:15.889 --> 00:39:23.662]  Now that is supposedly designed to allow people to say oh I want to kill this paedophile or I want to kill this
[00:39:24.805 --> 00:39:26.326]  ISIS, Jihadists, right?
[00:39:26.386 --> 00:39:27.547]  That's what it's designed to do.
[00:39:27.827 --> 00:39:29.788]  But we're on the same list as them.
[00:39:30.169 --> 00:39:32.070]  We're equally as bad in Facebook size.
[00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:33.411]  So this is a cult.
[00:39:33.751 --> 00:39:46.679]  This is a violent extremist cult now in Facebook with two billion plus users on the planet openly inciting its followers, its users, to break laws in virtually every developed country.
[00:39:46.759 --> 00:39:52.183]  This is illegal to go on there and break laws and incite violent hatred against us.
[00:39:53.030 --> 00:40:01.577]  They lecture us all day, Alex, Facebook, about how they want to stop hate and make the internet a safer, secure and better place.
[00:40:02.198 --> 00:40:09.944]  They are openly inciting the most violent hate imaginable against anyone that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[00:40:10.344 --> 00:40:12.586]  How Orwellian does it need to get?
[00:40:12.626 --> 00:40:17.490]  They don't even have this yet in Communist China and we have it here in the West.
[00:40:18.729 --> 00:40:24.353]  Salman Rushdie, 20-something years ago, wrote the satanic verses, and Iran put out a fatwa to have him killed.
[00:40:25.654 --> 00:40:35.840]  This is literal fatwas on us, and it's just done like it's no big deal, and all over the news, suddenly Democrats are saying, let's get physical, let's get violent, let's shut them up, let's arrest people that criticize us.
[00:40:36.201 --> 00:40:38.002]  They are preparing their people
[00:40:39.332 --> 00:40:47.925]  To not just confront us at the gas station or at the restaurant or the department store, like Maxine said last year, they are gearing up to kill us!
[00:40:48.146 --> 00:40:49.288]  I mean, this is unbelievable, Paul.
[00:40:51.275 --> 00:40:56.300]  Exactly, and they're not just focusing it on public figures like ourselves.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:08.110]  Remember, the Daily Beast did an article, I think it was last month or the month before, about the black forklift truck driver who created the Nancy Pelosi parody video, okay?
[00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:16.377]  Facebook doxed him, gave his info to the Daily Beast so they could do a hit piece on him, expose him, and dox him.
[00:41:16.417 --> 00:41:18.359]  That's right, Paul, that's where this is going.
[00:41:18.439 --> 00:41:21.501]  They beta tested on us, and now they're gonna tear people apart.
[00:41:21.861 --> 00:41:30.508]  The average person to teach everybody, you keep your damn mouth shut, or we'll send a mob to your house to kill your ass, like they send armed mobs to Tommy Robinson's house.
[00:41:31.704 --> 00:41:32.184]  Precisely.
[00:41:32.324 --> 00:41:35.285]  It's not, like, isn't it enough to just ban us?
[00:41:35.385 --> 00:41:36.225]  No, it's not enough.
[00:41:36.265 --> 00:41:40.987]  They literally have to incite violent hate mobs to come and take us out.
[00:41:41.407 --> 00:41:43.948]  And by the way, they've got a list of hate agents.
[00:41:44.348 --> 00:41:48.289]  They have different levels before you get banned and you get on their hate agent list.
[00:41:48.949 --> 00:41:56.992]  And you get on that list, as you've mentioned earlier, one way to do so is not just by praising Tommy Robinson, myself, or Alex Jones.
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:06.185]  It says literally, and they got the leaked documents, reporting neutrally on any of the people that they've got on their dangerous persons list.
[00:42:06.205 --> 00:42:21.614]  So doing basic straightforward journalism is now against Facebook's rules and terms and will get you put on their hate agent list, which could eventually get you put on their dangerous persons list and have violent hatred incited against you.
[00:42:21.834 --> 00:42:25.316]  So this is a giant organized criminal racketeering mafia.
[00:42:25.836 --> 00:42:33.620]  When you get 10 or 15 members of the mafia in New York harassing shops, threatening them, talking bad about them, they would get busted for organized crime practices.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.822]  This is actual organized crime practices, Paul.
[00:42:38.484 --> 00:42:38.884]  Completely.
[00:42:38.904 --> 00:42:41.126]  You want to talk about harm, you want to talk about threats.
[00:42:41.526 --> 00:42:47.610]  I mean, people like Laura Loomer have, you know, she got kicked off there for basically disagreeing with a jihadist group.
[00:42:48.131 --> 00:42:50.172]  Those people have already sent threats against her.
[00:42:50.292 --> 00:42:51.453]  I get death threats on Facebook.
[00:42:51.493 --> 00:42:52.914]  I did all the time when I was on it.
[00:42:53.194 --> 00:42:55.576]  So it's not as if people aren't willing to carry this through.
[00:42:55.596 --> 00:42:58.078]  Oh, they're going to use Facebook to organize our murder.
[00:42:58.398 --> 00:42:59.419]  It's a weapon system.
[00:43:07.884 --> 00:43:09.765]  My name is Tommy Robinson.
[00:43:09.965 --> 00:43:18.688]  Today I'm calling on the help of Donald Trump, his administration and the Republican Party to grant me and my family political asylum in the United States of America.
[00:43:18.828 --> 00:43:22.249]  I'm standing today before you to make my case of political persecution.
[00:43:23.004 --> 00:43:27.705]  I have been found guilty of what is the equivalent of exercising First Amendment rights.
[00:43:28.525 --> 00:43:31.086]  Benjamin Franklin had the foresight to know this.
[00:43:31.726 --> 00:43:36.707]  Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech.
[00:43:36.927 --> 00:43:49.030]  For more than 10 years I've been proactive voice, highlighting the industrialised grooming, the pimping, the beating and the raping of young vulnerable British girls up and down the length and breadth of my once great country.
[00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:50.110]  I'm an Englishman.
[00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:55.374]  A British citizen who loves my country and it hurts me to have to say I have no future here.
[00:43:56.114 --> 00:43:58.776]  The only future that lies for me is death.
[00:43:59.877 --> 00:44:05.681]  Death at the hands of an establishment who will feed me to Islamic gangs of jihadis within the prison system.
[00:44:06.581 --> 00:44:08.543]  I have 48 hours before my sentencing.
[00:44:09.366 --> 00:44:14.213]  I previously spent three months in solitary confinement for journalism, for breaking no law.
[00:44:14.414 --> 00:44:19.000]  The reality is, and I urge you, please, get your lawyers to look through this case.
[00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:21.925]  You will expose and see complete corruption.
[00:44:22.654 --> 00:44:24.936]  I'm being found guilty when I've broke no laws.
[00:44:25.376 --> 00:44:27.898]  I've not been tried by my peers.
[00:44:27.918 --> 00:44:31.000]  Twelve members of the British public, that's the Magna Carta.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.381]  That's common law.
[00:44:32.901 --> 00:44:38.525]  Common law is if members of my peers, if the British public find me guilty, I'll accept my fate.
[00:44:38.565 --> 00:44:39.445]  I'm not being tried.
[00:44:40.226 --> 00:44:46.530]  This is a backdoor ruling in order for the government to silence me, imprison me and inevitably have me killed.
[00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:51.694]  To understand the level of political correctness that has infected this once great nation.
[00:44:52.175 --> 00:44:53.816]  We are imprisoning journalists.
[00:44:54.076 --> 00:44:55.878]  And our media celebrate it.
[00:44:55.958 --> 00:44:57.600]  But this is a direct appeal.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.842]  On behalf of my family, we love the United States.
[00:45:01.763 --> 00:45:02.924]  I have no future here.
[00:45:03.304 --> 00:45:03.825]  It's inevitable.
[00:45:03.845 --> 00:45:05.807]  I will be murdered, I will be killed.
[00:45:06.387 --> 00:45:09.450]  And I will be imprisoned on Thursday for journalism.
[00:45:10.566 --> 00:45:13.148]  We talk about North Korea, we talk about China, we talk about Russia.
[00:45:13.628 --> 00:45:14.529]  Our freedoms are gone.
[00:45:15.089 --> 00:45:16.230]  Our free speech is gone.
[00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:17.011]  It's gone.
[00:45:17.051 --> 00:45:18.532]  We live in a post-free speech era.
[00:45:19.193 --> 00:45:23.735]  And exactly the same, what they've inflicted in this nation, I know they want to do to yours.
[00:45:24.275 --> 00:45:27.117]  I know they want to take your freedoms, they want to change your constitution.
[00:45:27.357 --> 00:45:30.098]  I know there's people who would take away your rights tomorrow.
[00:45:30.438 --> 00:45:33.239]  The difference is, they want to do it to you in America.
[00:45:33.499 --> 00:45:34.520]  They've done it to us.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.120]  They've done it to us.
[00:45:36.681 --> 00:45:38.582]  Our free speech is gone and it's celebrated.
[00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:42.863]  It's celebrated by the people in power, who rule over us, the globalists.
[00:45:43.084 --> 00:45:43.904]  It's celebrated.
[00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:47.251]  It's celebrated when a journalist is being imprisoned.
[00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:49.432]  The media, they're not journalists.
[00:45:49.612 --> 00:45:50.553]  They're activists.
[00:45:50.933 --> 00:46:00.117]  If this was happening to a journalist in any other country, in China, in Russia, in North Korea, human rights lawyers would be fighting to defend them.
[00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:04.179]  And what I realise now is that my government don't care if the world's watching.
[00:46:04.259 --> 00:46:05.799]  They don't care if they're breaking the law.
[00:46:05.899 --> 00:46:06.460]  They don't care.
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.341]  And they actually don't give a damn what the people actually want or vote for.
[00:46:09.441 --> 00:46:11.382]  They don't care about the British justice system.
[00:46:11.722 --> 00:46:13.463]  Looks an absolute joke across this world.
[00:46:14.023 --> 00:46:15.764]  All they care about is getting what they want.
[00:46:16.264 --> 00:46:19.866]  We are run by nothing but a globalist dictatorship.
[00:46:19.886 --> 00:46:23.587]  They moan about Russia, they moan about China, they moan about the countdown on free speech.
[00:46:23.787 --> 00:46:26.208]  They're the biggest bunch of hypocrites walking this planet.
[00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:29.730]  They are traitors that are ruining my beautiful country.
[00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:33.231]  They're removing our fundamental freedoms step by step, day by day.
[00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:34.612]  Every day we're losing our freedoms.
[00:46:35.422 --> 00:46:43.951]  I want to make a genuine appeal to President Trump, to the Republican Party, please consider me and my family for political asylum.
[00:46:44.551 --> 00:46:56.003]  The British state's appeasement to Islam, the unrestricted waves of migrants into this country means that they are deliberately persecuting and illegally imprisoning anyone who speaks out against their globalist agenda.
[00:47:07.105 --> 00:47:09.693]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:30.413 --> 00:47:33.176]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going right back to Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:47:33.276 --> 00:47:39.364]  Then, you saw Tommy Robinson's story, linked up on drugreport.com, then you picked up by hundreds of major publications.
[00:47:39.864 --> 00:47:41.947]  They tried to spin and lie what's happening to Tommy.
[00:47:42.467 --> 00:47:46.492]  Tommy's been found guilty by judges, not juries, of civil
[00:47:47.611 --> 00:47:48.231]  Disobedience.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:09.342]  We've got an extremely powerful interview this morning that we're going to air at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:48:09.782 --> 00:48:13.364]  Roger Stone will join us for several segments to talk about Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:48:13.684 --> 00:48:14.784]  He wrote a whole book about it.
[00:48:15.104 --> 00:48:16.044]  Clinton's War on Women.
[00:48:16.545 --> 00:48:17.265]  Talked about Epstein.
[00:48:17.305 --> 00:48:18.445]  He has the inside baseball.
[00:48:18.625 --> 00:48:19.326]  They don't want you to hear.
[00:48:19.606 --> 00:48:24.347]  That is coming up briefly here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:24.587 --> 00:48:25.988]  1776 Worldwide Specials.
[00:48:26.448 --> 00:48:31.310]  This is how you find the tip of the spear and keep this operation going despite the enemy trying to
[00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:37.432]  Kick us off the internet, then demonize us, imprison us.
[00:48:37.452 --> 00:48:38.512]  I mean, you see what they're doing.
[00:48:38.552 --> 00:48:39.652]  This is a real war.
[00:48:40.112 --> 00:48:40.953]  You are the target.
[00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:46.614]  Help keep the spirit of 1776 alive and get game-changing products at the lowest prices ever.

[00:49:39.608 --> 00:49:42.649]  And those Limited Edition Betsy Ross shirts are almost sold out.
[00:49:43.129 --> 00:49:45.971]  We'll have some new ones, but it takes a lot of money to fund this operation.
[00:49:46.311 --> 00:49:53.354]  We've got a lot of other operations going on that obviously folks don't know about to circumnavigate the deplatforming.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:55.581]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:49:55.601 --> 00:49:56.942]  This is the second American Revolution.
[00:49:57.282 --> 00:49:58.403]  Don't sit there on the sidelines.
[00:49:58.443 --> 00:49:58.923]  Get involved.
[00:49:58.943 --> 00:50:01.245]  I want to thank all of you that have been involved.
[00:50:01.545 --> 00:50:05.868]  Again, Infowarsstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:50:06.768 --> 00:50:09.490]  Or simply, as I said, go to Infowarslife.com.
[00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:10.631]  It takes you right to the supplements.
[00:50:11.031 --> 00:50:14.594]  Paul Watson, I want people to understand, this is not about us.
[00:50:15.578 --> 00:50:17.279]  This is the global social credit score.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:18.220]  It's here.
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:19.321]  They're moving.
[00:50:19.721 --> 00:50:20.381]  They're doing it.
[00:50:21.482 --> 00:50:24.424]  And, you know, Trump is just now starting to figure out this is happening.
[00:50:24.825 --> 00:50:26.065]  He has this summit tomorrow.
[00:50:26.566 --> 00:50:33.511]  And what it really is is like kettling, like the police do, one of the producers pointed out, like where they get a group of protesters and put them into a confined area.
[00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:37.493]  Well, we're being taken off the web so we can't respond.
[00:50:37.513 --> 00:50:39.195]  We have our own platforms we built smartly.
[00:50:40.049 --> 00:50:41.290]  So they're trying to shut those down.
[00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:43.691]  They're lying about us, and now they want us killed.
[00:50:44.492 --> 00:50:45.312]  Now they want us killed.
[00:50:45.392 --> 00:50:48.874]  I mean, they're saying in terms of service, recapping that, that this is what they want.
[00:50:49.494 --> 00:50:50.835]  This has been premeditated.
[00:50:50.855 --> 00:50:52.076]  This is a big deal.
[00:50:52.356 --> 00:50:53.857]  This is so dangerous.
[00:50:53.877 --> 00:50:56.939]  A, by calling us dangerous, they lump us in with murderers and people.
[00:50:57.299 --> 00:51:00.381]  But even murderers, or whatever, you shouldn't say people have a right to go kill.
[00:51:01.922 --> 00:51:03.904]  They are becoming judge, jury, and executioner.
[00:51:04.304 --> 00:51:07.967]  Zuckerberg's coming out with his own global, digital, cashless currency.
[00:51:08.568 --> 00:51:13.772]  They're setting up these weird communal rooms where you can't have a Facebook unless everyone else is allowed in your info.
[00:51:14.172 --> 00:51:18.236]  He's training everyone to officially let Facebook rape them.
[00:51:20.495 --> 00:51:23.157]  They've gone completely power-mad, Alex.
[00:51:23.718 --> 00:51:24.418]  It is a cult.
[00:51:25.019 --> 00:51:33.906]  As proven by what you were talking about earlier, you cannot even mention or wear an InfoWars t-shirt on their platforms anymore without denouncing it.
[00:51:34.126 --> 00:51:37.649]  Even reporting neutrally on it, they will get rid of you.
[00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:39.751]  They've completely jumped the shot.
[00:51:40.231 --> 00:51:40.892]  Oh, and by the way,
[00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:53.579]  The Antifa group that cracked two people's skulls in Portland a couple of weeks ago, that put cement in milkshakes and threw them at journalists two weeks ago, they're still on Facebook.
[00:51:53.639 --> 00:51:55.440]  It's called Rose City Antifa.
[00:51:56.221 --> 00:52:02.484]  Joe Biggs got banned on Twitter after he posted the images of that guy with his head cracked open.
[00:52:02.864 --> 00:52:09.868]  The guy who posted the video of that violent attack by a domestic terrorist group, his video got deleted.
[00:52:09.908 --> 00:52:11.849]  In fact, I think he got banned on Twitter as well.
[00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:20.413]  The very group behind the violence, Rose City Antifa, is still on Facebook and is still on Twitter.
[00:52:20.713 --> 00:52:22.434]  The group that doxxed, harassed,
[00:52:23.336 --> 00:52:26.723]  Threatened Tucker Carlson's family, showed up at his house, banged on his door.
[00:52:27.549 --> 00:52:28.470]  They're still on Twitter.
[00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:31.412]  So, I mean, I'm kind of blackpilled at this point, Alex.
[00:52:31.432 --> 00:52:33.014]  They've got this social media summit.
[00:52:33.534 --> 00:52:34.235]  I wasn't invited.
[00:52:34.275 --> 00:52:35.075]  You weren't invited.
[00:52:35.416 --> 00:52:40.800]  Nobody from what I've seen who's been actually banned on any social media platform was invited.
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:45.764]  They set up a website where people could whine about it and send an email to a black hole.
[00:52:46.365 --> 00:52:49.967]  So I'm really beyond the point of having any hope in that.
[00:52:50.368 --> 00:52:55.312]  I do have hope in our listeners, our audience, as you said, because they've stood behind us at every single point.
[00:52:56.033 --> 00:52:58.255]  So it will just go back to the olden days, Alex.
[00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:06.720]  It will go back to analogue, newsletters, websites, and people staying on that home turf, buying the products and supporting us that way.
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:10.323]  That's the only way we're going to survive, because everything else is going to go to waste.
[00:53:26.353 --> 00:53:27.695]  Editorial cartoonists in the world.
[00:53:28.516 --> 00:53:34.642]  They said because he made fun of George Soros puppeteering some of the generals in the White House, which was true.
[00:53:35.523 --> 00:53:36.304]  That was in the news.
[00:53:36.824 --> 00:53:41.329]  And that the Rothschilds fund Soros, which is true, because those people happen to be Jewish.
[00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:50.632]  That's anti-semitic, and so Politico playbook, New White House says cartoonist is no longer attending social media summit.
[00:53:51.052 --> 00:53:56.173]  So if they put any heat on somebody, those people are immediately thrown under the bus.
[00:53:56.454 --> 00:53:56.994]  Well, guess what?
[00:53:57.594 --> 00:53:59.234]  The whole Republican Party turned against Trump.
[00:53:59.274 --> 00:53:59.834]  We backed him.
[00:53:59.854 --> 00:54:00.555]  We got him elected.
[00:54:00.995 --> 00:54:02.795]  These people aren't just globalists.
[00:54:03.155 --> 00:54:06.196]  They're a bunch of sycophantic cowards that surround Trump.
[00:54:08.126 --> 00:54:11.347]  That's exactly what I've been told, Alex, about this social media summit.
[00:54:11.847 --> 00:54:26.111]  Basically, if you've ever criticised Trump or one of his policies at any point, which I've done with his Syria attack, which was stupid and he backed away from, or you've done on certain other issues because you have independent thought, you don't get anywhere near Trump.
[00:54:26.151 --> 00:54:27.292]  And again, that's not Trump's fault.
[00:54:27.352 --> 00:54:29.733]  It's the sycophants that surround him, as you say.
[00:54:30.193 --> 00:54:34.514]  And they will throw people like Ben Garrison under a bus and anyone who gets heat.
[00:54:34.974 --> 00:54:37.755]  Now Media Matters has put out another hit piece
[00:54:38.487 --> 00:54:44.528]  Calling out the extremist figures who've been invited to the White House Social Media Summit.
[00:54:44.889 --> 00:54:46.469]  Who are these extremist figures?
[00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:54.051]  Well, they include a Republican Congressman, Gates, Republican Senator Blackburn and Charlie Kirk.
[00:54:54.471 --> 00:54:56.111]  So now they're extremists.
[00:54:56.151 --> 00:54:59.712]  So you see the line has shifted significantly, hasn't it?
[00:55:00.422 --> 00:55:05.146]  And the bar for who qualifies as an extremist seems to be very low these days.
[00:55:05.206 --> 00:55:23.480]  And then everyone appeases it, and so many of his staff secretly go meet with Media Matters and they meet with Democrats and they talk crap about Trump and how dumb he is and how he's an idiot, and then they all creep back hoping they don't get picked off and targeted, but once they talk to the New York Times or Media Matters, they're then blackmailed.
[00:55:24.241 --> 00:55:24.961]  That's how they work.
[00:55:24.981 --> 00:55:28.302]  We have the New York Times, calls our former employees, offers them money.
[00:55:28.943 --> 00:55:31.904]  And then once they get them to admit stuff, they go, ooh, you're the bad one.
[00:55:32.424 --> 00:55:36.045]  We're having to do a story on how you're bad, unless you say things about Alex Jones.
[00:55:36.085 --> 00:55:38.406]  And then they criminally make things up.
[00:55:38.426 --> 00:55:40.487]  We're getting ready to sue a couple of them, because we have to.
[00:55:41.247 --> 00:55:42.347]  But that's what this is.
[00:55:42.707 --> 00:55:44.128]  That's how these people operate, man.
[00:55:44.188 --> 00:55:44.808]  It's insane.
[00:55:46.909 --> 00:55:47.329]  Exactly.
[00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:49.910]  I mean, the only way to deal with what's happening is
[00:55:50.698 --> 00:55:55.724]  Again, to rely on our audience, to support us, which they have done, and to pursue this privately.
[00:55:56.125 --> 00:55:59.369]  Laura Loomer's got a $3 billion lawsuit against Facebook.
[00:55:59.909 --> 00:56:01.752]  I'm already pursuing Facebook.
[00:56:02.152 --> 00:56:09.441]  They failed to turn over the data, which is a legal requirement in the European Union after 30 days under a subject access request.
[00:56:09.481 --> 00:56:10.062]  Of why you were banned?
[00:56:10.976 --> 00:56:13.338]  Yeah, they refused to send over the data.
[00:56:13.658 --> 00:56:23.467]  The information commissioner for the UK said it was bizarre and if they don't do so after this extra two month period, then that's going to be a big legal problem.
[00:56:23.507 --> 00:56:24.728]  And Paul, let's go further.
[00:56:24.928 --> 00:56:30.433]  They said three months ago in internal emails that got leaked to Business Insider, Jones has done nothing wrong, we can't ban him.
[00:56:30.993 --> 00:56:34.115]  And they say, well, let's just call him a hate figure and then ban him, which they did.
[00:56:34.155 --> 00:56:35.575]  So yes, we're getting suits ready.
[00:56:35.815 --> 00:56:36.516]  Takes a lot of money.
[00:56:36.616 --> 00:56:37.656]  That'll be the next month, folks.
[00:56:37.676 --> 00:56:38.137]  Get ready.
[00:56:38.197 --> 00:56:38.697]  It's happening.
[00:56:39.057 --> 00:56:39.757]  Paul's getting ready.
[00:56:39.797 --> 00:56:40.358]  He's already gone.
[00:56:40.378 --> 00:56:41.278]  The lawyers are gearing up.
[00:56:41.578 --> 00:56:44.540]  They have to go through the different levels of this.
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:50.543]  And now, Paul, you're getting death threats from people on Facebook sent to you from Facebook to your other accounts.
[00:56:51.003 --> 00:56:54.905]  And so you now have a criminal filing that you're preparing right now against Facebook.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:57:02.026]  Well, this obviously is a direct violation of UK law, 1988 Malicious Communications Act.
[00:57:02.546 --> 00:57:12.175]  Quote, any person who sends to another person a letter, electronic communication, or article of any description which conveys a threat is guilty of an offence.
[00:57:12.676 --> 00:57:19.082]  Facebook is now inciting that very violence, which I've already had on Facebook, by the way, for years when I was on it.
[00:57:19.122 --> 00:57:20.123]  Paul Statham, we've got to go to break.
[00:57:20.163 --> 00:57:20.604]  This is critical.
[00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:22.065]  I'm going to say this right now, folks.
[00:57:22.665 --> 00:57:26.027]  Under Section 230, they could argue it's third-party immunity.
[00:57:26.287 --> 00:57:28.708]  But once they're told, they have to remove a death threat.
[00:57:29.028 --> 00:57:35.432]  But now they're officially saying death threats are allowed after they defame someone saying they're marked for death.
[00:57:35.672 --> 00:57:36.312]  They're done.
[00:57:36.512 --> 00:57:38.053]  The lawyers are hands down.
[00:57:38.073 --> 00:57:38.954]  But what does that tell you?
[00:57:39.714 --> 00:57:41.478]  They don't think the country's gonna be here soon.
[00:57:41.838 --> 00:57:44.223]  I think they're getting ready to nuke Trump or pull something.
[00:57:44.443 --> 00:57:46.627]  They're acting like they're getting ready for a bloody civil war.
[00:57:47.108 --> 00:57:47.949]  In fact, there's no doubt.
[00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:51.315]  They've launched the bugle call for terror attacks!
[00:57:54.401 --> 00:57:58.604]  Folks, we are launching another limited edition right now t-shirt.
[00:57:58.664 --> 00:58:00.365]  We're only going to have 4,000 of these.
[00:58:00.485 --> 00:58:04.328]  There's four different variants, two different shirts in white and in navy blue.
[00:58:04.488 --> 00:58:05.608]  I'm very excited about it.
[00:58:05.749 --> 00:58:11.292]  It is the Betsy Ross flag, the first flag made by an abolitionist, made by an American.
[00:58:11.432 --> 00:58:12.513]  She came up with the design.
[00:58:12.533 --> 00:58:16.155]  It's a beautiful flag, one of the most recognizable in history, if not world history.
[00:58:16.295 --> 00:58:17.096]  And it's a white
[00:58:17.276 --> 00:58:17.436]  Sure.
[00:58:37.605 --> 00:58:38.425]  Two different variants.
[00:58:38.565 --> 00:58:39.306]  Two different colors.
[00:58:39.326 --> 00:58:40.566]  That's four shirts.
[00:58:40.646 --> 00:58:42.927]  We're printing a thousand of each.
[00:58:43.167 --> 00:58:45.228]  The order was put in yesterday.
[00:58:45.368 --> 00:58:48.129]  The place where they make them in America is printing them now.
[00:58:48.269 --> 00:58:49.870]  They'll be shipped to us by next week.
[00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:51.190]  Two weeks for delivery.

[01:00:19.639 --> 01:00:20.720]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:21.821]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:22.421 --> 01:00:27.025]  I'm sitting here on this live Wednesday, July 10, 2019 transmission.
[01:00:27.906 --> 01:00:29.007]  It's noon, straight up.
[01:00:29.047 --> 01:00:30.128]  Paul Watson's with us here.
[01:00:30.948 --> 01:00:34.051]  And I'm trying to come up with a headline for this interview once it's not live.
[01:00:34.351 --> 01:00:40.316]  We're going to take it and put it out on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com on our own servers, on our own streams.
[01:00:40.896 --> 01:00:42.798]  We built our own system, and they're trying to shut that down.
[01:00:43.318 --> 01:00:44.199]  You can email it out.
[01:00:44.239 --> 01:00:45.720]  You can Facebook it as well.
[01:00:45.781 --> 01:00:46.421]  You can Twitter it.
[01:00:46.681 --> 01:00:47.362]  You can YouTube it.
[01:00:48.558 --> 01:00:50.902]  They'll try to censor you, they'll try to tell you what you can do.
[01:00:51.343 --> 01:00:53.567]  But now they're organizing our murder.
[01:00:54.047 --> 01:00:55.069]  Officially, our death.
[01:00:56.131 --> 01:00:58.635]  And I can't come up with a headline strong enough.
[01:00:58.996 --> 01:01:00.639]  And I think this really signifies, Paul...
[01:01:02.013 --> 01:01:03.775]  That this is next level.
[01:01:03.815 --> 01:01:07.618]  Facebook is greenlighting violence against conservatives.
[01:01:07.638 --> 01:01:11.522]  You know, that's the headline I put out today for the live feed.
[01:01:12.623 --> 01:01:14.444]  How would you quantify how big this is?
[01:01:14.484 --> 01:01:18.107]  For me, it shows that they're planning a violent revolution.
[01:01:18.528 --> 01:01:23.372]  And suddenly, everybody from Joe Biden to you name it are saying we're going to have a physical violent revolution.
[01:01:25.623 --> 01:01:27.985]  No, they are legitimising exactly that.
[01:01:28.025 --> 01:01:32.088]  They're legitimising violent domestic terrorists to follow through on their threats.
[01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:45.219]  And it's interesting because we had a story back in May, just after I got banned on Facebook, where a woman complained about assassination threats against the President on Facebook.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.001]  And what did they do?
[01:01:47.061 --> 01:01:48.742]  They banned her for three days.
[01:01:49.383 --> 01:01:50.804]  So are we now to assume
[01:01:51.491 --> 01:01:59.195]  The President Trump will eventually, or already is, listed in that designated hateful people category.
[01:01:59.675 --> 01:02:05.438]  So then they allow people to pose death threats and to organize violence against the President of the United States.
[01:02:05.458 --> 01:02:06.779]  That's the level it's got to now.
[01:02:07.319 --> 01:02:12.482]  Because on the flip side, you've had people literally banned for calling out
[01:02:13.423 --> 01:02:21.225]  Suicide bombers, Islamic terrorists, specifically suicide bombers in one instance, Palestinian suicide bombers as barbarians.
[01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:23.345]  She was banned on Facebook.
[01:02:23.705 --> 01:02:26.626]  So again, we're literally lower now.
[01:02:27.206 --> 01:02:35.408]  According to Zuckerberg and Facebook, we are less, we're more subhuman than suicide bombers and pedophiles and people like this.
[01:02:35.468 --> 01:02:36.769]  So we're even below them.
[01:02:37.029 --> 01:02:38.469]  Because you can get on Facebook,
[01:02:39.398 --> 01:02:44.480]  When Hamas was bombing Israel about a month ago, you could get on Facebook and praise Hamas.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:47.582]  You can't get on there and neutrally report about Alex Jones.
[01:02:47.922 --> 01:02:54.285]  So we're literally lower than organised terrorist groups and suicide bombers now, in the eyes of Facebook.
[01:02:54.645 --> 01:03:04.330]  A company with 2.4 billion users, which is the eighth largest corporation in the world, and I would argue the most influential corporation when it comes to
[01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:19.524]  Well, Paul, what they're doing is, whatever the Democrats, the EU, and the shycoms tell them, they're adopting it.
[01:03:19.584 --> 01:03:20.245]  They admit that.
[01:03:21.046 --> 01:03:28.653]  And so what we're seeing is what the Democrats, what the EU, and what others want, and it's just flaming, flagrant authoritarianism.
[01:03:30.325 --> 01:03:35.369]  Yeah, and there's all this debate about, oh, is Google going to build a censored search engine in China?
[01:03:35.409 --> 01:03:36.610]  That's controversial, isn't it?
[01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:40.013]  Is Facebook going to integrate more with the Chinese government?
[01:03:40.273 --> 01:03:42.334]  Because the Chinese government's bad, isn't it?
[01:03:42.394 --> 01:03:51.321]  Because they identify dissidents who commit thought crimes and then either imprison them or make them social pariahs, ostracize them from society.
[01:03:51.602 --> 01:03:52.362]  That's bad!
[01:03:52.682 --> 01:03:55.885]  How dare Google or Facebook even consider doing that in China?
[01:03:56.145 --> 01:03:57.266]  They're doing it right now!
[01:03:57.346 --> 01:03:59.808]  Now in the West, even more so.
[01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.989]  And where is it?
[01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:03.592]  Like Breitbart reported on this, obviously we did.
[01:04:03.972 --> 01:04:05.133]  Where's Fox News?
[01:04:05.554 --> 01:04:07.556]  Where are the big conservative talking heads?
[01:04:07.996 --> 01:04:09.497]  None of them are even raising this.
[01:04:09.557 --> 01:04:10.759]  It's barely a news story.
[01:04:10.999 --> 01:04:13.281]  You know, RT did a story on it, that's it.
[01:04:13.621 --> 01:04:15.243]  The Russian government will cover it.
[01:04:15.603 --> 01:04:17.445]  Fox News doesn't give a damn.
[01:04:18.362 --> 01:04:27.149]  And Tommy Robinson's facing two to three years for asking questions outside a convicted pedophile ring court, saying, what do you think of your sentencing?
[01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:29.471]  They tell him you were born out your mother's ass.
[01:04:30.012 --> 01:04:31.593]  And then now he faces two to three years.
[01:04:31.973 --> 01:04:33.735]  And the media is like, well, he's in contempt.
[01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:35.416]  He didn't get a jury trial.
[01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:36.837]  It's not even real.
[01:04:37.198 --> 01:04:40.180]  Paul Watson, summit.news, infowars.com.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.081]  Everyone fight back.
[01:04:41.101 --> 01:04:41.741]  Spread those links.
[01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:42.802]  We're not backing down.
[01:04:42.862 --> 01:04:43.383]  Neither are you.
[01:04:43.403 --> 01:04:44.524]  But you agree with me, Paul.
[01:04:44.784 --> 01:04:47.066]  This signifies they're getting ready to go violent big time.
[01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:49.371]  Oh, it's creepy.
[01:04:49.391 --> 01:04:52.655]  And if they don't reverse this immediately, then all bets are off, Alex.
[01:04:52.975 --> 01:04:53.335]  That's right.
[01:04:53.375 --> 01:04:56.879]  This is a major test to see what we'll put up with.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.100]  Thank you, Paul.
[01:04:58.141 --> 01:04:58.661]  Amazing job.
[01:04:58.681 --> 01:05:05.168]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:06.429]  1776 worldwide.
[01:05:07.751 --> 01:05:10.033]  That's a term I coined 15 years ago.
[01:05:10.902 --> 01:05:11.583]  What does it really mean?
[01:05:11.643 --> 01:05:16.248]  It means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide.
[01:05:16.268 --> 01:05:17.789]  It doesn't mean we go conquer countries.
[01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:26.278]  It means our superior Western values of true freedom get adopted because compared to globalism, it's night and day.
[01:05:27.059 --> 01:05:30.103]  We're going to do a 34-hour special broadcast
[01:05:31.072 --> 01:05:33.634]  The show that kicks off this Thursday morning at 8 a.m.
[01:05:33.654 --> 01:05:39.198]  with David Knight runs right through with me and many others until the next day at 6 p.m.
[01:05:39.238 --> 01:05:39.778]  on The War Room.
[01:05:40.319 --> 01:05:42.040]  We're going to have our crew in D.C.
[01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.383]  at the White House Summit on social media.
[01:05:45.403 --> 01:05:50.286]  We're going to be at the after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship and so much more.
[01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:52.107]  So everybody, share that link.
[01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:56.291]  Infowars.com forward slash show kicking off this Thursday at 8 a.m.
[01:05:57.128 --> 01:06:00.049]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:01.090]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:39.113 --> 01:06:40.934]  Well, if you're a TV listener, you can see this.
[01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:44.998]  If you're a radio listener, it's all on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:06:45.858 --> 01:06:50.542]  I've got, let's not exaggerate, about 150 news articles right here.
[01:06:51.263 --> 01:06:52.484]  Almost all of them are mainstream.
[01:06:53.965 --> 01:06:57.428]  Saying everything that I said 7, 8, 9 years ago.
[01:06:57.568 --> 01:06:59.789]  Everything Roger Stone said 7, 8, 9 years ago.
[01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:03.973]  And in the book he wrote, Clinton's war on women 4 years ago.
[01:07:03.993 --> 01:07:04.553]  4 years ago.
[01:07:07.967 --> 01:07:10.648]  Trump's blueprint for the campaign.
[01:07:13.268 --> 01:07:20.510]  And now the media trying to spin Epstein onto Trump, when even the lawyers for the victims say, no, Trump's the only person that helped.
[01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:21.991]  He was never on the airplanes.
[01:07:22.011 --> 01:07:23.131]  He was never around these kids.
[01:07:23.631 --> 01:07:30.853]  One time he walked into a party and brought Dale out at a pool, said, aren't they nice having all the, letting all the neighborhood kids play here?
[01:07:30.873 --> 01:07:32.534]  And they said, these aren't neighborhood kids.
[01:07:32.594 --> 01:07:33.974]  And Trump ran out of the building.
[01:07:34.898 --> 01:07:55.150]  Roger Stone has the exclusive, he lives in Florida, he knows, he's covered Epstein and the whole inside baseball, but what we know now is Google, Facebook, Twitter, mainstream corporate media, Wikipedia, are all covering up what's really happening.
[01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:59.333]  They are all covering up.
[01:08:00.999 --> 01:08:07.124]  Any connection to Epstein, to the Clintons, or the logs on the airplanes with the little girls' names as initials?
[01:08:07.884 --> 01:08:13.849]  Everything, incidentally, that's in Clinton's war on women, that is the blueprint of the new FBI investigation.
[01:08:14.509 --> 01:08:16.310]  So, is this investigation going to go deep?
[01:08:16.811 --> 01:08:27.759]  I was reading, yesterday, at Infowars.com, from the FBI press release, things found at Epstein's house.
[01:08:28.119 --> 01:08:29.000]  Torture chairs.
[01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:31.320]  Child porn!
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.343]  A whole safe full of little girls he reportedly, you know, wanted.
[01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:42.327]  His own private sex slave facility with underground basements under a temple.
[01:08:44.108 --> 01:08:50.672]  We also covered so much more here on air.
[01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:54.475]  Here it is, the Clinton's war on women, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:56.109 --> 01:08:58.812]  So it's definitely getting bad, and it's getting bad quick.
[01:08:59.232 --> 01:09:01.014]  Let's go ahead and go to Roger Stone.
[01:09:01.534 --> 01:09:16.608]  Roger, I want to give you the floor of the next few segments to go through all the angles, the real history, the cover-up, what this signifies, how this all got released with Alan Dershowitz and Mike Cernovich and others suing to get it, and where you think this is going.
[01:09:16.628 --> 01:09:17.189]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:09:18.407 --> 01:09:20.187]  Well, first of all, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:09:20.267 --> 01:09:27.129]  We laid this all out on InfoWars literally more than two years ago, every last bit of it.
[01:09:28.109 --> 01:09:30.850]  But it's really an epic tale and it's worth telling.
[01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:42.192]  This all begins when the Palm Beach police get a tip from some parents about a child coming home with her lunchbox full of money.
[01:09:42.714 --> 01:09:46.939]  When they ask her where the money comes from, it's clear that it comes from Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.645]  The police launch a long time undercover investigation.
[01:09:52.325 --> 01:09:57.732]  They find evidence of child sex trafficking, multiple assaults on minors.
[01:09:58.411 --> 01:10:17.747]  An operation in which Grizzlane Maxwell, the daughter of the late press baron Robert Maxwell, later an honored guest at Chelsea Clinton's wedding, are actually going to bus stations, train stations, procuring runaways for this operation.
[01:10:18.617 --> 01:10:30.890]  In any event, the police chief, who is an honest guy, a guy named Ryder, takes the investigation to the state's attorney, a fellow named Kirshner, expecting a giant indictment.
[01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:36.316]  And instead, Kirshner indicts Epstein on one count of solicitation.
[01:10:36.876 --> 01:10:37.357]  One count.
[01:10:38.663 --> 01:11:01.910]  And the resultant sentence for that is a 15-month sentence, of which Epstein only serves 13 months in the air-conditioned Palm Beach jail, not in a state penitentiary, which is the norm in this state for a sex offender at this level.
[01:11:03.026 --> 01:11:10.008]  And he's only required to be incarcerated, Alex, from 10 o'clock at night till 6 o'clock in the morning.
[01:11:10.369 --> 01:11:11.929]  So it's a slap on the wrist.
[01:11:12.549 --> 01:11:16.370]  Ryder, the police chief, outraged, goes to the U.S.
[01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:22.712]  attorney for the Fort Lauderdale-Palm Beach-Miami District, Alexander Acosta.
[01:11:23.393 --> 01:11:29.335]  Acosta is a George W. Bush appointee under the Bush Justice Department.
[01:11:30.996 --> 01:11:36.598]  He conducts his own investigation, he rubber stamps the state charge, and then he seals it.
[01:11:37.438 --> 01:11:45.361]  It is only because of an epic legal struggle, Alex, by the Palm Beach Post, that we know that much, that we know exactly what happened.
[01:11:48.041 --> 01:11:56.123]  Roger, we now have people involved in the investigation, I'll show some of these articles in a moment, saying they were told, leave it alone, Jeffrey Epstein works for U.S.
[01:11:56.163 --> 01:11:57.423]  Intelligence and the FBI.
[01:11:57.823 --> 01:12:10.426]  Let's bring in now, and then get into all the proof in the next few segments, of Robert Mueller using him with the cameras in the mansions, the cameras in his New York facility, the seven-story dungeon, the dungeon out in the Caribbean.
[01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.468]  Well Alex, I can't comment on any of that.
[01:12:13.528 --> 01:12:15.869]  And I will not, and you speak for yourself.
[01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.770]  I will say this.
[01:12:37.243 --> 01:12:41.717]  There's really three people who deserve enormous credit for busting this story open.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:51.766]  Julie Brown, a really crusading reporter with the Miami Herald, who writes a multi-part series on Epstein.
[01:12:52.706 --> 01:12:58.230]  Mike Cernovich, who goes to court at a crucial time to get certain documents unsealed.
[01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:07.596]  And a woman named Conchita Sarnoff, who wrote a terrific book on this, who is an advocate for children and a crusader against child sex trafficking.
[01:13:07.896 --> 01:13:09.757]  Who never gave up on this case.
[01:13:10.238 --> 01:13:17.863]  I think this would have been dead and buried without those three individuals and they should be lauded extensively.
[01:13:18.343 --> 01:13:25.188]  What's amazing to me now is the way the mainstream media is trying to play up a Trump connection that is peripheral at best.
[01:13:25.848 --> 01:13:28.150]  Epstein is actually never really a member.
[01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:29.951]  We're good to go.
[01:13:47.433 --> 01:13:59.444]  In her deposition, she says she was in the presence of Trump and Epstein on one occasion, and that Trump comported himself as a complete gentleman, and she saw him do nothing inappropriate.
[01:13:59.905 --> 01:14:03.028]  We also know from Virginia Roberts' attorney
[01:14:03.427 --> 01:14:12.391]  Brett Edwards that the only big-name celebrity who cooperated in their lawsuit and in the investigation was Donald Trump himself.
[01:14:12.851 --> 01:14:23.576]  So now you have Google and Wikipedia trying to erase the Clinton
[01:14:25.459 --> 01:14:41.364]  Epstein relationship when, as you will see in my book, The Clinton's War on Women, FAA records show that Bill Clinton is on the airplane of Jeffrey Epstein 26 times.
[01:14:42.364 --> 01:14:45.325]  He goes to the island 17 times.
[01:14:45.685 --> 01:14:47.426]  He put out a statement two days ago.
[01:14:47.486 --> 01:14:48.646]  He said he was there once.
[01:14:49.126 --> 01:14:51.327]  Then he's amended it to say four times.
[01:14:52.183 --> 01:14:53.825]  All of that is disprovable.
[01:14:54.285 --> 01:14:58.209]  I got these FAA records through a Freedom of Information Act request.
[01:14:58.689 --> 01:15:03.333]  It shows that Clinton ditched his Secret Service detail on numerous occasions.
[01:15:03.353 --> 01:15:04.394]  By the way, let me stop you.
[01:15:04.454 --> 01:15:05.776]  We have plenty of time to go through all this.
[01:15:06.296 --> 01:15:07.997]  You have this in your book four years ago.
[01:15:08.678 --> 01:15:13.359]  Now we learn the same FAA records were in the secret FBI file, suppressed by the U.S.
[01:15:13.399 --> 01:15:16.859]  Attorney, suppressed by the court, that Mike Cernovich and others got released.
[01:15:16.899 --> 01:15:23.561]  So that's, again, it's confirming that the information you put in your book, the only place it was, was indeed accurate.
[01:15:25.081 --> 01:15:33.342]  Well, and again, there's very substantial evidence here of a tighter connection.
[01:15:33.702 --> 01:15:36.683]  We know that Epstein was a contributor to Hillary Clinton.
[01:15:37.193 --> 01:15:42.818]  We know that the Clinton Foundation took a contribution from him after Epstein... Stay there, stay there.
[01:15:42.878 --> 01:15:45.661]  And Roger, I want you to go through the history and who's really involved.
[01:15:45.701 --> 01:15:52.046]  The attempt to frame Trump, what it means all this is coming out, how they're politically going to deal with it.
[01:15:52.326 --> 01:15:55.849]  Nancy Pelosi's daughter saying this is going to bring down a lot of top Democrats.
[01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:57.751]  I want to get the big picture with you as well.
[01:16:02.715 --> 01:16:04.057]  This isn't mumbo-jumbo.
[01:16:05.677 --> 01:16:07.458]  This isn't some preacher on TBN.
[01:16:07.979 --> 01:16:09.280]  And I'm not even bashing those folks.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.821]  I'm saying this really happens with me.
[01:16:13.142 --> 01:16:20.868]  I was driving into work last Wednesday whenever Colin Kaepernick demanded the American flag be taken off Nike tennis shoes.
[01:16:21.828 --> 01:16:22.889]  And I was so frustrated.
[01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:30.835]  And I remember my own psyche, Holy Spirit, intuition, whatever you want to call it, go bloop!
[01:16:32.016 --> 01:16:32.956]  It was a no-brainer, really.
[01:16:34.497 --> 01:16:34.697]  Alex.
[01:16:35.905 --> 01:16:40.328]  Instead of just bitching about Kaepernick and Nike, put out shoes.
[01:16:41.249 --> 01:16:42.409]  Shoes with the American flag.
[01:16:42.689 --> 01:16:43.850]  Try to find an American company.
[01:16:44.351 --> 01:16:45.731]  And I got here, we made a bunch of calls.
[01:16:45.771 --> 01:16:46.512]  It's hard to find.
[01:16:46.552 --> 01:16:47.393]  Nothing's made in America.
[01:16:47.773 --> 01:16:48.393]  And I went, wait a minute.
[01:16:48.934 --> 01:16:50.234]  We can make t-shirts in America.
[01:16:50.695 --> 01:16:52.376]  We already make almost all our shirts in America.
[01:16:53.604 --> 01:16:58.247]  Put in an order for 4,000 Betsy Ross flag shirts with America's Back InfoWars.com.
[01:16:58.287 --> 01:16:59.287]  These colors don't run.
[01:17:00.228 --> 01:17:04.210]  And I remember in my gut, I said, I believe this is the next Hillary for President shirt.
[01:17:05.011 --> 01:17:07.072]  We sold 100,000 of that shirt.
[01:17:07.673 --> 01:17:10.454]  Now, half of it we sold at $5, which was cost.
[01:17:10.794 --> 01:17:13.756]  I probably lost money after all the infrastructure and stuff, because the shirts cost $5.
[01:17:15.691 --> 01:17:17.752]  We probably lost money because of the infrastructure.
[01:17:18.713 --> 01:17:25.817]  I just knew when I saw a handmade sign five years ago in a yard that said Hillary for President.
[01:17:26.337 --> 01:17:27.157]  I took a photo of it.
[01:17:27.177 --> 01:17:27.798]  It was handmade.
[01:17:29.359 --> 01:17:32.640]  And I took it to the crew.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.041]  We met it.
[01:17:33.101 --> 01:17:34.642]  It went crazy.
[01:17:35.442 --> 01:17:39.084]  I know this Betsy Ross flag of America's back is going to be the new one.
[01:17:39.304 --> 01:17:39.965]  But I said only 4,000.
[01:17:42.599 --> 01:17:44.000]  Of this designer limited edition.
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:45.280]  Finest fabric.
[01:17:45.481 --> 01:17:48.742]  The shirt costs us nine and a half dollars.
[01:17:48.842 --> 01:17:50.023]  The fabric's eight bucks.
[01:17:50.043 --> 01:17:53.344]  I mean, I only like smooth, nice shirts that are part acrylic, you know.
[01:17:53.584 --> 01:17:54.124]  These are great.
[01:17:56.323 --> 01:17:59.824]  We'll make a new shirt that's similar, but there's only like a thousand left of these right now.
[01:18:00.164 --> 01:18:07.426]  But if we end up making the zeitgeist on this, and this is the new shirt of 2020, we can sell a couple hundred thousand, fund our whole operation, kick Globalist's ass.
[01:18:07.846 --> 01:18:11.107]  So get your Betsy Ross flags, two different colors, two different designs.

[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.164]  No wonder the KKK Democrats are so upset!
[01:18:34.073 --> 01:18:38.297]  Folks, we are launching another limited edition right now t-shirt.
[01:18:38.357 --> 01:18:40.058]  We're only going to have 4,000 of these.
[01:18:40.178 --> 01:18:44.001]  There's four different variants, two different shirts in white and in navy blue.
[01:18:44.161 --> 01:18:45.282]  I'm very excited about it.
[01:18:45.443 --> 01:18:50.967]  It is the Betsy Ross flag, the first flag made by an abolitionist, made by an American.
[01:18:51.187 --> 01:18:52.228]  She came up with the design.
[01:18:52.248 --> 01:18:56.772]  It's a beautiful flag, one of the most recognizable in history, if not world history, and it's a white
[01:18:56.952 --> 01:18:57.172]  Sure.
[01:19:17.281 --> 01:19:18.102]  Two different variants.
[01:19:18.242 --> 01:19:18.982]  Two different colors.
[01:19:19.022 --> 01:19:20.243]  That's four shirts.
[01:19:20.323 --> 01:19:22.605]  We're printing a thousand of each.
[01:19:22.845 --> 01:19:24.886]  The order was put in yesterday.
[01:19:25.046 --> 01:19:27.788]  The place where they make them in America is printing them now.
[01:19:27.928 --> 01:19:29.570]  They'll be shipped to us by next week.
[01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:30.870]  Two weeks for delivery.

[01:19:52.966 --> 01:19:54.427]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.611 --> 01:20:26.996]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones and Roger Stone has a gag order on him.
[01:20:27.016 --> 01:20:32.142]  He's not allowed to get into anything to do with the whole fake Russia investigation.
[01:20:32.242 --> 01:20:33.844]  That's not why he's here today.
[01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:41.554]  He's here because he wrote the defining book, The Clinton's War on Women, about Jeffrey Epstein and all of it.
[01:20:41.914 --> 01:20:49.819]  He interviewed Brett Edwards and lawyers that worked with the victims, and that's how he was able to have the manifest logs before anybody ever had them.
[01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:53.981]  And now all these new documents have come out confirming everything Roger has broken down.
[01:20:54.001 --> 01:21:00.105]  But Roger, before we get into the whole history of it, the background, how this could bring down the whole house of cards in your words, just
[01:21:00.805 --> 01:21:07.427]  Briefly, with all the censorship by Google and the media trying to cover this up, why do you think they're so scared?
[01:21:08.769 --> 01:21:17.531]  Well, it's very interesting, Alex, that the investigation is being run by the Public Corruption Unit, not the Child Sex Trafficking Unit.
[01:21:17.951 --> 01:21:23.233]  Huge credit needs to go to the Southern District of New York for bringing these charges.
[01:21:23.993 --> 01:21:25.573]  This is not double jeopardy.
[01:21:25.593 --> 01:21:32.735]  These appear to be new charges, not the charges that Epstein was previously charged with in Florida.
[01:21:33.796 --> 01:21:40.101]  And that leads me to believe that there are other political figures who are going to be embroiled in this.
[01:21:40.181 --> 01:21:43.564]  Nancy Pelosi's daughter speculated about it.
[01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:46.287]  Was this a blackmail operation?
[01:21:46.367 --> 01:21:47.107]  A honey trap?
[01:21:47.548 --> 01:21:49.249]  Was he taking video?
[01:21:49.329 --> 01:21:51.992]  Why was he constantly trying to get powerful men?
[01:21:55.553 --> 01:22:03.677]  I mean, I think this is potentially has many, many more shoes to drop.
[01:22:04.697 --> 01:22:14.962]  And we still don't have the answer as to why Alexander Acosta rubber stamped the slap on the wrist by Florida state prosecutors.
[01:22:15.524 --> 01:22:16.585]  And then sealed it.
[01:22:17.105 --> 01:22:25.808]  We do know that Alberto Gonzalez, who was Bush's attorney general at the time, said that they didn't want to see the matter politicized.
[01:22:26.249 --> 01:22:31.751]  And we were heading into an election in which Hillary Clinton was, at that point, the favorite.
[01:22:32.211 --> 01:22:41.535]  So I think reading between the lines, they looked at the Clinton-Epstein connection and elected not to bring an indictment.
[01:22:42.315 --> 01:22:46.936]  That was broader for sex trafficking and multiple offenses.
[01:22:47.676 --> 01:22:59.479]  You know, Epstein settled lawsuits with $33 million worth of women, or now women, girls then, that he assaulted.
[01:23:00.019 --> 01:23:04.400]  A few brave women refused to settle, wanting justice.
[01:23:04.841 --> 01:23:09.842]  Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Roberts-Jeffrey, was one.
[01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:20.774]  When Brett Edwards, the crusading attorney here in Fort Lauderdale represented her, Epstein turned around and sued him for defamation.
[01:23:21.495 --> 01:23:25.856]  A suit that was ultimately settled and did not go to court.
[01:23:26.296 --> 01:23:34.259]  So enormous credit belongs to Virginia Roberts for having the guts to see this through.
[01:23:34.719 --> 01:23:36.800]  And again, Julie Brown of the
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:42.944]  Miami Herald, Mike Cernovich, who deserves enormous credit, and Conchita Sarnoff.
[01:23:43.044 --> 01:23:47.427]  Three individuals, unconnected, busted this wide open.
[01:23:47.507 --> 01:23:48.047]  That's right.
[01:23:48.147 --> 01:23:54.992]  And speaking of Brett Edwards, who's represented a lot of the victims successfully, you were telling me, I asked if you knew him, you said, of course, read the footnotes.
[01:23:55.032 --> 01:23:56.853]  He's one of the experts in your book.
[01:23:56.893 --> 01:24:02.416]  Let's play a clip of him talking about the only person that was helpful that knew Epstein.
[01:24:02.577 --> 01:24:02.877]  Here it is.
[01:24:03.786 --> 01:24:20.635]  The only thing that I can say about President Trump is that he is the only person who, in 2009, when I served a lot of subpoenas on a lot of people, or at least gave notice to some pretty connected people that I wanted to talk to them,
[01:24:22.236 --> 01:24:45.882]  He is the only person who picked up the phone and said, let's just talk, I'll give you as much time as you want, I'll tell you what you need to know, and was very helpful in the information that he gave, and gave no indication whatsoever that he was involved in anything untoward whatsoever, but had good information, that checked out, and that helped us, and that we didn't have to take a deposition of him.
[01:24:45.962 --> 01:24:46.563]  And that was in 2009?
[01:24:46.603 --> 01:24:47.023]  That was in 2009.
[01:24:48.462 --> 01:24:49.683]  And that's Bradley Edwards.
[01:24:49.743 --> 01:24:56.148]  So, give us the straight scoop here, because it's in your book, you've told me privately, we've had conversations.
[01:24:57.209 --> 01:24:58.730]  Trump is all about being in control of his life.
[01:24:58.790 --> 01:25:05.695]  He would never go somewhere and have sex, much less with an underage person, but in some jet or at some corrupt guy's house.
[01:25:06.396 --> 01:25:12.641]  You even told the story about one time he did tell you a man saw some creepy stuff at Epstein's house, he ran out of there.
[01:25:12.921 --> 01:25:15.183]  I mean, tell folks what you do know about Trump and Epstein.
[01:25:15.933 --> 01:25:23.241]  Well, Virginia Roberts says in her deposition that she only saw Trump at Epstein's home once.
[01:25:23.341 --> 01:25:32.191]  And on that occasion, he later said that he said to his driver as they pulled up, when he saw all these young girls in the swimming pool,
[01:25:32.811 --> 01:25:34.472]  Boy, that Epstein is a nice guy.
[01:25:34.512 --> 01:25:37.314]  Look at the way he lets the neighborhood kids use his pool.
[01:25:37.754 --> 01:25:43.317]  He also left after 15 minutes very uncomfortable with the situation.
[01:25:43.457 --> 01:25:49.361]  Again, Virginia Roberts said she didn't see the president do anything inappropriate and he was a complete gentleman.
[01:25:49.781 --> 01:25:55.605]  Well, do you remember like three years ago I asked you about this and you said, right when he was first getting elected, you said, oh, he hates Epstein.
[01:25:55.905 --> 01:26:01.168]  We've since then found a couple clips where he said he didn't like Epstein years ago, even before he won.
[01:26:02.825 --> 01:26:05.027]  But he barred him from his club.
[01:26:05.127 --> 01:26:07.529]  That was a good 15 years ago.
[01:26:07.549 --> 01:26:24.844]  So, look, this is a phony effort by the mainstream media to associate Epstein with the president, whose relationship is peripheral at best, whereas Bill Clinton has put out a statement that is a bald-faced lie, only on his plane once.
[01:26:25.264 --> 01:26:26.125]  Actually, Epstein
[01:26:30.481 --> 01:26:40.585]  Clinton used Epstein's plane to fly to Asia to pick up a check from a sultan who was another known pedophile for the Clinton Foundation.
[01:26:40.825 --> 01:26:43.827]  You'll find that in my book, The Clinton's War on Women.
[01:26:44.207 --> 01:26:46.948]  This is an unfair attack on President Trump.
[01:26:47.308 --> 01:26:51.250]  His relationship with Epstein is peripheral at best.
[01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:53.951]  There's no evidence of wrongdoing on his part.
[01:26:54.191 --> 01:26:55.892]  There's not even evidence of knowledge.
[01:26:56.252 --> 01:26:56.873]  On his part.
[01:27:18.353 --> 01:27:19.314]  Some are being indicted.
[01:27:19.754 --> 01:27:26.718]  The woman who alleged that Donald Trump raped her at age 13, one of the billionaire pedophiles, Jeffrey Epstein's notorious sex parties, fabricated the story.
[01:27:27.179 --> 01:27:28.239]  They've learned exclusively.
[01:27:28.379 --> 01:27:32.242]  We'll talk about when we come back, but it's now conclusively proven fabricated.
[01:27:32.502 --> 01:27:34.183]  Who is paying for all these fabrications?
[01:27:35.203 --> 01:27:36.684]  It's an interesting question, Alex.
[01:27:36.904 --> 01:27:41.367]  During the 2016 campaign, some man kept calling my cell phone.
[01:27:42.003 --> 01:27:46.706]  And saying, Katie Johnson and hanging up happened multiple times.
[01:27:47.627 --> 01:27:52.331]  She scheduled a press conference for which she never showed up.
[01:27:52.671 --> 01:27:56.373]  Somebody paid her to bear false witness against the president.
[01:27:56.734 --> 01:27:58.075]  There is nothing there.
[01:27:58.235 --> 01:28:00.997]  I've known Donald Trump for 40 years.
[01:28:01.757 --> 01:28:07.201]  And yes, he was quite the playboy in between marriages, and he dated some beautiful women.
[01:28:07.261 --> 01:28:08.062]  But Donald Trump
[01:28:08.402 --> 01:28:10.622]  He loves women, not young girls.
[01:28:11.283 --> 01:28:15.843]  And the idea that he was involved in anything inappropriate here is a smear.
[01:28:16.023 --> 01:28:17.404]  It's nothing but a smear.
[01:28:17.764 --> 01:28:22.925]  Meanwhile, Google takes down all of the images of Epstein and Bill Clinton.
[01:28:23.245 --> 01:28:29.546]  And Wikipedia rewrites Epstein's bio to cut Bill Clinton out of it like he doesn't exist.
[01:28:30.006 --> 01:28:34.607]  It is a perfect example of the same kind of censorship that's being used on InfoWars,
[01:28:34.987 --> 01:28:37.007]  It's being used on the Stone Cold Truth.
[01:28:37.388 --> 01:28:45.549]  It's being used on conservatives and libertarians and Trump supporters and non-liberals on social media.
[01:28:45.569 --> 01:28:46.329]  All right, Roger Stone.
[01:28:46.349 --> 01:28:48.530]  Let's talk about what's coming next in this war.
[01:28:49.170 --> 01:28:50.630]  Why the deep state's so scared.
[01:28:51.010 --> 01:28:52.451]  Roger Stone, straight ahead.
[01:28:52.551 --> 01:28:54.231]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news.
[01:28:54.531 --> 01:28:56.171]  Today, be sure to check out his websites.
[01:28:56.452 --> 01:28:58.032]  We'll give you those addresses when we come back.
[01:29:10.837 --> 01:29:15.018]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:29:16.038 --> 01:29:18.539]  To prosecute wars takes a lot of money.
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:29.022]  And if you look at the communists, they'll rob banks, they'll sell children to sex slavery, they'll hold people ransom for money for the revolutions.
[01:29:30.643 --> 01:29:32.563]  But that's not how our founding fathers did it.
[01:29:33.643 --> 01:29:35.544]  They just robbed British gold shipments.
[01:29:37.344 --> 01:29:37.845]  Kill people.
[01:29:38.525 --> 01:29:40.007]  We're not doing any of that.
[01:29:40.467 --> 01:29:47.475]  We're just selling t-shirts and books and films and air filtration and non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[01:29:47.635 --> 01:29:51.018]  A general store of high quality products at great prices.
[01:29:52.159 --> 01:29:53.981]  And so, we have our new special.
[01:29:54.982 --> 01:29:57.385]  And it is the biggest special we've ever had.
[01:29:58.652 --> 01:30:01.114]  The last special we had was basically Christmas in July.
[01:30:01.774 --> 01:30:02.955]  It's the best specials we do.
[01:30:02.975 --> 01:30:05.557]  50% off, free shipping, stuff like that.
[01:30:06.278 --> 01:30:13.123]  This new special, if you take advantage of all the sales that are there, is 75% off.
[01:30:13.624 --> 01:30:14.765]  More than 30 items.
[01:30:15.906 --> 01:30:17.387]  The average item is 50% off.
[01:30:18.388 --> 01:30:20.749]  So the sale runs the gambit, the gauntlet.
[01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:23.752]  From 75% off to 25% off.
[01:30:24.192 --> 01:30:25.593]  And there's a bunch of other specials too.
[01:30:26.414 --> 01:30:27.515]  A dozen items.
[01:30:29.238 --> 01:30:30.139]  Our 1776.
[01:30:31.419 --> 01:30:35.882]  Some of these items retail for $50 and we've never sold them for this price.
[01:30:36.763 --> 01:30:37.423]  But it's true.
[01:30:37.523 --> 01:30:39.404]  I've habituated the audience to big sales.
[01:30:40.565 --> 01:30:41.966]  And the audience is smart.
[01:30:41.986 --> 01:30:48.029]  They know, wow, these are really good deals on the air filtration, the water filtration, the seeds, the supplements.
[01:30:48.710 --> 01:30:49.250]  Here's an example.
[01:30:50.671 --> 01:30:51.732]  Nobody ever put
[01:30:52.566 --> 01:30:55.167]  Fifteen plus dollars into a turmeric formula.
[01:30:55.927 --> 01:30:59.729]  Our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula has at least $15 a product in it.
[01:31:00.429 --> 01:31:02.890]  Not counting shipping and marketing, everything goes into the cost.
[01:31:03.670 --> 01:31:05.651]  The leading competitor puts $5 in the bottle.
[01:31:06.011 --> 01:31:10.733]  It's the strongest turmeric extract with all the other key co-enzymes.
[01:31:11.273 --> 01:31:13.394]  If you don't know about turmeric, you need to learn about it.
[01:31:13.414 --> 01:31:14.895]  If you don't know about Body's, you should find out about it.
[01:31:15.155 --> 01:31:16.435]  That's one product.
[01:31:17.536 --> 01:31:18.176]  And ladies and gentlemen,
[01:31:19.162 --> 01:31:23.166]  It is the highest discount we've ever offered on it.
[01:31:23.386 --> 01:31:24.066]  75% off.
[01:31:26.008 --> 01:31:27.209]  It's just crazy.
[01:31:27.609 --> 01:31:30.252]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main site.
[01:31:30.632 --> 01:31:33.835]  InfoWarsLife.com is the supplement area.
[01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:34.916]  It takes you right to that.
[01:31:35.376 --> 01:31:45.285]  And in celebration of the amazing victories we're having against tyranny, we're having the 1776 worldwide sale that we are just launching.
[01:31:45.985 --> 01:31:46.165]  Yeah.
[01:32:01.451 --> 01:32:03.492]  ...are also discounted for $17.76.
[01:32:04.932 --> 01:32:12.055]  So everything is on sale, okay, at Infowars4.com, and that's how we fund this operation.
[01:32:12.115 --> 01:32:18.577]  And again, I can't tell you about all the initiatives we're involved in, because when my name's on it, the enemy tries to shut it down.
[01:32:19.097 --> 01:32:19.817]  You already understand that.
[01:32:20.097 --> 01:32:24.259]  But what you see visibly at Infowars is the tip of the iceberg.
[01:32:25.452 --> 01:32:31.296]  There's a giant mountain under the water, and we are doing amazing things thanks to your support.

[01:33:02.241 --> 01:33:02.942]  Thank you for watching.
[01:33:06.344 --> 01:33:08.986]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:27.100]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[01:33:27.943 --> 01:33:29.630]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:39.089 --> 01:33:41.052]  Jeffrey Epstein is a terrific guy.
[01:33:41.893 --> 01:33:44.376]  Well, I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him.
[01:33:44.396 --> 01:33:45.838]  I mean, people in Palm Beach knew him.
[01:33:45.898 --> 01:33:47.520]  He was a fixture in Palm Beach.
[01:33:48.761 --> 01:33:50.864]  I had a falling out with him a long time ago.
[01:33:50.884 --> 01:33:52.826]  I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years.
[01:33:53.247 --> 01:33:53.867]  I wasn't a fan.
[01:33:54.588 --> 01:33:55.068]  I was not.
[01:33:55.268 --> 01:33:56.208]  Yeah, a long time ago.
[01:33:56.248 --> 01:33:57.549]  I'd say maybe 15 years.
[01:33:58.869 --> 01:33:59.889]  I was not a fan of his.
[01:34:00.249 --> 01:34:01.009]  That I can tell you.
[01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:02.130]  I was not a fan of his.
[01:34:02.190 --> 01:34:11.871]  So I feel very badly actually for Secretary Acosta because I've known him as being somebody that works so hard and has done such a good job.
[01:34:11.911 --> 01:34:14.932]  I feel very badly about that whole situation.
[01:34:15.192 --> 01:34:18.653]  But we're going to be looking at that and looking at it very closely.
[01:34:18.933 --> 01:34:19.453]  Bill Clinton.
[01:34:20.695 --> 01:34:21.415]  Nice guy.
[01:34:22.876 --> 01:34:27.779]  Got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island with Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:34:27.839 --> 01:34:34.663]  A lot of problems.
[01:34:36.184 --> 01:34:50.152]  I'm not going to cut into Roger Stone's time here, because it's so important, but I'm at the center, you're at the center, of two major court victories in the last 24 hours that you're not going to see in newspapers.
[01:34:51.883 --> 01:35:01.513]  So, second half of the next segment, I will get into some of those big successes for you.
[01:35:03.455 --> 01:35:05.417]  One deals with Facebook, one deals with Sandy Hook.
[01:35:06.458 --> 01:35:09.180]  In fact, guys, I had my Hartford Current article in here and I can't find it.
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.061]  Just print me another one, please.
[01:35:12.492 --> 01:35:16.233]  But going back to Roger Stone, yeah, look at that headline.
[01:35:16.273 --> 01:35:17.173]  I'm going to do it later, guys.
[01:35:17.213 --> 01:35:18.053]  We'll do it later, okay?
[01:35:18.633 --> 01:35:23.535]  Because if you read that headline, you won't even know what you're reading until you actually read the article or the court ruling.
[01:35:24.395 --> 01:35:25.155]  Unheard of.
[01:35:25.535 --> 01:35:26.475]  One in a million.
[01:35:27.356 --> 01:35:28.096]  No press coverage.
[01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:29.696]  Wait till you learn about it next segment.
[01:35:30.976 --> 01:35:36.918]  Also, Facebook just changed their policy of saying they can kill us whenever they want to.
[01:35:38.353 --> 01:35:39.874]  So that was all a test, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:39.894 --> 01:35:41.115]  We're going to cover that next segment.
[01:35:41.636 --> 01:35:44.699]  In fact, I want to hold Roger over a little bit in the next segment to get into censorship with him.
[01:35:44.979 --> 01:35:49.703]  But getting back to Roger Stone, obviously, who needs no introduction.
[01:35:50.383 --> 01:35:50.684]  Roger.
[01:35:53.476 --> 01:35:54.436]  The next shoe to drop.
[01:35:54.556 --> 01:35:55.977]  You got your ear to the ground.
[01:35:56.537 --> 01:35:58.358]  That's why you came on the broadcast today.
[01:35:58.858 --> 01:36:04.800]  Let's spend some time, 35,000 foot view, not just, okay, we've been vindicated, you've been vindicated.
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.260]  Epstein, it's all true.
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:14.023]  He was caught reportedly with more pedophilia crap, dungeons, torture chairs at his house, according to the FBI list of things that were found in his home.
[01:36:14.343 --> 01:36:16.864]  That's up on Infowars.com and a Jamie White article.
[01:36:17.284 --> 01:36:20.565]  We'll get to that a little bit later, but what's the next shoe to drop?
[01:36:20.765 --> 01:36:21.585]  Who's implicated?
[01:36:21.806 --> 01:36:22.886]  Who's on these aircraft?
[01:36:24.397 --> 01:36:29.661]  Well, we know that former Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico was on the aircraft.
[01:36:29.741 --> 01:36:35.286]  We know that Senator George Mitchell, the former Senate Majority Leader, was on the aircraft.
[01:36:35.326 --> 01:36:40.030]  We know that Stephen Hawking, the athlete, was on the
[01:36:40.670 --> 01:36:52.676]  The aircraft, we know that Prince Andrew of the Royal Family visited the pedophile island.
[01:36:53.116 --> 01:36:59.359]  According to Virginia Roberts' deposition, which I have read, she was forced to have sex with him.
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:02.181]  So it touches the British Royal Family.
[01:37:03.121 --> 01:37:10.443]  The fact that the Public Correction Unit of the Southern District of New York is covering this, I think is laudable.
[01:37:11.063 --> 01:37:13.204]  This looks to me like a political scandal.
[01:37:13.564 --> 01:37:14.844]  Now, we're speculating.
[01:37:15.364 --> 01:37:20.846]  Did Epstein have tape incriminating videos?
[01:37:21.226 --> 01:37:22.606]  Did he have other proof?
[01:37:22.666 --> 01:37:32.109]  Is this why he was constantly inviting powerful men to his compound, which Sean Hannity called a pedophile island?
[01:37:32.509 --> 01:37:38.834]  You know, if there's one other person who does deserve credit for staying on this story, it would be Sean Hannity.
[01:37:39.134 --> 01:37:46.359]  When everybody else dropped it, during 2016, he came up with the term Lolita Express.
[01:37:46.719 --> 01:37:48.941]  He came up with the term Pedophile Island.
[01:37:49.281 --> 01:37:54.645]  He presented the straightforward facts based on the FAA flight records.
[01:37:55.526 --> 01:37:58.788]  So he also deserves enormous credit.
[01:37:59.595 --> 01:38:07.319]  We also don't know whether Epstein's confederates like Grislaine Maxwell will become state's evidence witnesses.
[01:38:07.739 --> 01:38:09.980]  That's certainly a possibility.
[01:38:10.861 --> 01:38:21.526]  Again, this whole thing was dormant for so many years, and now it is being prosecuted by the Trump Justice Department, despite an incredible effort
[01:38:21.966 --> 01:38:27.071]  By the mainstream media to make this a Trump scandal, which it is not.
[01:38:27.531 --> 01:38:28.912]  He has no exposure here.
[01:38:29.212 --> 01:38:30.774]  He's done nothing inappropriate.
[01:38:30.814 --> 01:38:31.955]  He cut this guy off.
[01:38:32.295 --> 01:38:34.457]  He barred him from his private club.
[01:38:35.438 --> 01:38:38.020]  He was not a fan, as you just saw.
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:43.285]  They would travel somewhat in charitable circles in Palm Beach and New York.
[01:38:43.365 --> 01:38:49.430]  They're both fabulously rich guys, but there's no evidence that they socialized together.
[01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:51.671]  I know Donald Trump.
[01:38:51.711 --> 01:38:53.232]  This is not his thing.
[01:38:53.512 --> 01:39:00.936]  Well, by the way, I want you to get into that, but I would drop Trump if there was any proof of pedophilia like a stinking dead cat.
[01:39:01.597 --> 01:39:09.381]  The truth is the entire corporate media is going overdrive to cover up Epstein and Clinton and all these Democrats connections.
[01:39:09.641 --> 01:39:12.003]  There'll be a few Republicans obviously as well, a few neocons.
[01:39:12.763 --> 01:39:16.865]  And then Trump's whole history is going after pedophiles and saying kill them on his Twitter five years ago.
[01:39:16.905 --> 01:39:20.086]  And we've seen a tenfold arrest of pedophiles.
[01:39:20.286 --> 01:39:25.588]  We're seeing child trafficking being absolutely shut down and Trump making a big issue out of it.
[01:39:25.648 --> 01:39:27.649]  So you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:39:28.249 --> 01:39:30.009]  Of the 26 women, none of it's real.
[01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:31.470]  I've been lied about.
[01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:32.730]  I've experienced the media.
[01:39:33.151 --> 01:39:36.992]  I've experienced the deep state after I'm sued mailing me secret code.
[01:39:37.072 --> 01:39:39.053]  Yes, coded pedophile stuff.
[01:39:39.853 --> 01:39:40.754]  Well, you can't see it.
[01:39:40.774 --> 01:39:46.376]  It's zeros and ones hidden in the email, which then they subpoena, which then they find.
[01:39:46.396 --> 01:39:52.200]  Not the people of the Senate, of course, I meant, which the Democrats subpoena and they find.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:53.840]  They would never do anything like that to me.
[01:39:54.801 --> 01:39:57.502]  The point is, is that this is just unbelievable.
[01:39:57.562 --> 01:39:58.643]  And so there's no evidence.
[01:39:58.683 --> 01:39:59.884]  I'm not just here defending Trump.
[01:40:00.424 --> 01:40:02.225]  I'm attacked because I defend Trump.
[01:40:03.047 --> 01:40:15.195]  But with Clinton and Hillary and all of them, and the people that work for them and their foundation, you can't take two steps without, you know, the head of her foundation is a convicted child trafficker!
[01:40:15.215 --> 01:40:17.077]  I mean, these people are monsters!
[01:40:18.268 --> 01:40:21.570]  Well, Alex, I could not agree with you more.
[01:40:22.510 --> 01:40:25.211]  As you know, I'm facing my own ordeal.
[01:40:25.231 --> 01:40:31.254]  I'm charged with seven counts of lying to Congress and related offenses.
[01:40:31.714 --> 01:40:33.935]  I have vigorously contested those charges.
[01:40:34.436 --> 01:40:35.496]  I am not guilty.
[01:40:35.716 --> 01:40:36.837]  I will go to trial.
[01:40:37.277 --> 01:40:45.301]  I need people who want to help me because I need to raise $1 million to hire another lawyer to go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:40:45.741 --> 01:40:47.362]  It's a daunting task.
[01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:51.812]  Those are the few things I am allowed to say about my case.
[01:40:51.852 --> 01:41:04.140]  So, folks, please go to StoneDefenseFund.com and make a contribution because I can only reach out to supporters of the President and to InfoWarriors.
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:06.481]  They destroyed me financially.
[01:41:06.701 --> 01:41:11.224]  I would gladly pay for my own legal defense if I could, but I've lost my home.
[01:41:11.764 --> 01:41:14.606]  My savings, most of my insurance, my car.
[01:41:15.226 --> 01:41:16.467]  I'm living hand to mouth.
[01:41:16.787 --> 01:41:18.428]  And still, I like you, Alex.
[01:41:18.488 --> 01:41:19.148]  I'm a fighter.
[01:41:19.328 --> 01:41:20.329]  I won't fold.
[01:41:21.089 --> 01:41:23.171]  And I will go to trial in Washington, D.C.
[01:41:23.191 --> 01:41:23.911]  this November.
[01:41:24.271 --> 01:41:25.572]  So please, your prayers.
[01:41:25.872 --> 01:41:26.753]  I need your prayers.
[01:41:27.093 --> 01:41:28.494]  Make no mistake about that.
[01:41:28.874 --> 01:41:31.796]  But those who can make a contribution, God bless you.
[01:41:32.036 --> 01:41:33.216]  Well, let me be clear about this.
[01:41:33.277 --> 01:41:34.137]  People don't understand.
[01:41:34.877 --> 01:41:37.019]  When you get the real high-powered lawyers,
[01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:42.093]  That know the subtle parlance and nomenclature of the courts.
[01:41:42.573 --> 01:41:48.137]  And they had to do research to make sure everything they're doing is exactly right in the cases for appeal and everything else.
[01:41:48.777 --> 01:41:54.220]  When they do it, it costs, for say a criminal case like Roger Stone, a million dollars.
[01:41:54.661 --> 01:41:57.963]  They had to go over hundreds of thousands of documents.
[01:41:58.503 --> 01:42:03.907]  And then when you just dump documents on them, then you have more problems, as we had to do.
[01:42:04.247 --> 01:42:04.687]  We spent $200,000.
[01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:12.814]  In one Sandy Hook case, because the judge ordered millions of emails turned over.
[01:42:12.854 --> 01:42:14.515]  We fought it seven, eight times.
[01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:19.419]  We should have had a better retention policy of getting rid of stuff, not to cover it up that everybody else does it, we're just idiots.
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.000]  But now we know to do that.
[01:42:21.361 --> 01:42:27.926]  We had to go through hundreds of thousands of these emails, cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars, and still we didn't find the hidden crap that somebody put in there as a time bomb.
[01:42:28.287 --> 01:42:31.609]  So you don't understand folks, this is how they destroy you, but you standing with us
[01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:34.291]  Here's what's allowed us to continue to operate.
[01:42:34.311 --> 01:42:39.315]  I want to ask Roger Stone about censorship and Trump's big media conference coming up tomorrow.
[01:42:39.415 --> 01:42:40.796]  And are we going to see action?
[01:42:40.816 --> 01:42:43.038]  Because the biggest place we haven't seen action is from Trump.
[01:42:43.278 --> 01:42:48.121]  We've heard he's going to do something, but so far we haven't seen jack crap.
[01:42:48.622 --> 01:42:51.964]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:42:52.264 --> 01:42:53.705]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:42:54.145 --> 01:42:56.747]  Whatever you do, spread those articles, spread those videos.
[01:42:56.887 --> 01:42:57.428]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:02.722 --> 01:43:13.468]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[01:43:13.949 --> 01:43:17.591]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[01:43:18.071 --> 01:43:27.437]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[01:43:28.177 --> 01:43:29.677]  The system is vulnerable.
[01:43:30.198 --> 01:43:32.378]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[01:43:32.878 --> 01:43:35.939]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:42.881]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[01:43:43.422 --> 01:43:48.783]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.

[01:45:12.344 --> 01:45:13.985]  Joe in California, then Kevin.
[01:45:14.005 --> 01:45:14.646]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:45:14.686 --> 01:45:15.086]  Thanks for holding.
[01:45:15.226 --> 01:45:15.646]  Hey, Alex.
[01:45:15.786 --> 01:45:26.814]  I wanted to say to you that when history presents itself, that you are one of the most important people that this country's ever had, as far as getting the word out, making the truth of what's going on in our country.
[01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:32.438]  And I want to thank you for that, because 15 years ago, when I started listening to you, I had no idea what was going on.
[01:45:32.718 --> 01:45:37.001]  And now people, when I talk to people, they think I'm crazy, and I just tell them, here's the fact.
[01:45:37.162 --> 01:45:38.362]  And I'm educating people.
[01:45:38.382 --> 01:45:41.945]  My family thought I was crazy for a long time, but now they're really educated.
[01:45:42.045 --> 01:45:42.485]  We're good to go.
[01:45:42.505 --> 01:45:43.026]  We're good to go.
[01:45:43.046 --> 01:45:43.607]  We're good to go.
[01:45:43.647 --> 01:45:44.127]  We're good to go.
[01:45:44.147 --> 01:45:44.768]  We're good to go.
[01:45:44.788 --> 01:45:45.408]  We're good to go.
[01:45:45.488 --> 01:45:46.089]  We're good to go.
[01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.970]  We're good to go.
[01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.410]  We're good to go.
[01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.991]  We're good to go.
[01:45:48.031 --> 01:45:48.631]  We're good to go.
[01:45:48.671 --> 01:45:49.112]  We're good to go.
[01:45:49.132 --> 01:45:49.632]  We're good to go.
[01:45:49.652 --> 01:45:50.173]  We're good to go.
[01:45:50.193 --> 01:45:51.334]  We're good to go.
[01:45:51.354 --> 01:45:52.115]  We're good to go.
[01:45:52.135 --> 01:45:52.735]  We're good to go.
[01:45:52.755 --> 01:45:53.236]  We're good to go.
[01:45:53.276 --> 01:45:53.796]  We're good to go.
[01:45:53.816 --> 01:45:54.417]  We're good to go.
[01:45:54.437 --> 01:45:55.018]  We're good to go.
[01:45:55.058 --> 01:45:55.718]  We're good to go.
[01:45:55.738 --> 01:45:56.139]  We're good to go.
[01:45:56.159 --> 01:45:56.639]  We're good to go.
[01:45:56.659 --> 01:45:57.420]  We're good to go.
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:45:58.161]  We're good to go.
[01:45:58.181 --> 01:45:59.142]  We're good to go.
[01:45:59.162 --> 01:45:59.762]  We're good to go.
[01:45:59.782 --> 01:46:00.463]  We're good to go.
[01:46:00.543 --> 01:46:01.103]  We're good to go.
[01:46:01.123 --> 01:46:01.664]  We're good to go.
[01:46:01.684 --> 01:46:02.485]  We're good to go.
[01:46:02.505 --> 01:46:03.025]  We're good to go.
[01:46:03.045 --> 01:46:03.506]  We're good to go.
[01:46:03.546 --> 01:46:04.026]  We're good to go.
[01:46:04.046 --> 01:46:04.827]  We're good to go.
[01:46:04.847 --> 01:46:05.247]  We're good to go.
[01:46:05.307 --> 01:46:05.468]  We're
[01:46:06.889 --> 01:46:08.110]  It's super male.
[01:46:08.130 --> 01:46:09.572]  The bone broth, the colloidal silver.
[01:46:09.812 --> 01:46:11.134]  I give my kids colloidal silver.
[01:46:11.154 --> 01:46:12.896]  They got a cold within a day or so.
[01:46:12.956 --> 01:46:14.117]  They don't have that cold anymore.
[01:46:14.217 --> 01:46:18.222]  My blood pressure has went from high to low and the doctors keep asking me what I'm taking.
[01:46:18.262 --> 01:46:20.985]  So I want to commend you on making the best product out there.
[01:46:21.105 --> 01:46:24.149]  And I went through a lot of products and I don't think anything's better than yours.
[01:46:24.309 --> 01:46:26.830]  Well, I appreciate your support, and again, I'll just tell people the truth.
[01:46:27.010 --> 01:46:28.790]  I know supplements work if they're high quality.
[01:46:29.370 --> 01:46:31.371]  I'm the worst at not taking them.
[01:46:31.391 --> 01:46:35.532]  And so I go through cycles where I take them, and then I lose all this weight and get healthy, and then I stop taking them.
[01:46:35.812 --> 01:46:38.653]  And I'm like, how do I get myself to take my own supplements?
[01:46:38.833 --> 01:46:42.674]  And then as soon as I go back on supplements, like I did two weeks ago, things start getting better again.
[01:46:42.694 --> 01:46:46.055]  So yes, these are the very best supplements out there, and they fund the Second American Revolution.
[01:46:46.155 --> 01:46:47.896]  So thank you so much, Joe, for those kind words.
[01:46:48.016 --> 01:46:51.957]  That's what funds the InfoWar at InfoWarStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:47:05.791 --> 01:47:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.561 --> 01:47:25.061]  Welcome back.
[01:47:25.121 --> 01:47:30.204]  Roger Stone, former chief advisor to President Trump, longtime friend, is our guest.
[01:47:30.224 --> 01:47:31.525]  He leaves us here in about five minutes.
[01:47:31.545 --> 01:47:33.486]  And Tommy Robinson,
[01:47:34.795 --> 01:47:38.998]  Gave us this morning, during the David Knight Show, what could be his last interview.
[01:47:39.038 --> 01:47:44.521]  He's facing two to three years in prison, no jury trial, for exposing pedophile rings that were convicted.
[01:47:46.203 --> 01:47:46.983]  Powerful interview.
[01:47:47.003 --> 01:47:53.147]  It's going to air for two segments, and then I have a lawyer joining us, Norm Pattis, with breaking news at the bottom of the hour.
[01:47:53.647 --> 01:47:58.170]  I'm not yet at liberty to get into with you, but this just broke on InfoWars.com.
[01:47:59.656 --> 01:48:09.540]  We learned that anyone listed as a dangerous individual, Facebook said, don't just criticize them, but you're allowed to foment violent conspiracies to kill them.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:17.684]  They actually say that it's okay to foment a violent conspiracy to organize people to kill them or cause other bodily harm.
[01:48:18.324 --> 01:48:21.926]  Now, this shows that Facebook was testing to see what they could get away with.
[01:48:22.813 --> 01:48:31.936]  And that Antifa literally is peopled by the Silicon Valley folks, the university trash, and the leftist in government.
[01:48:32.336 --> 01:48:33.436]  And that's come out in the news.
[01:48:34.316 --> 01:48:37.337]  And you see Joe Biden and all of them calling for a violent revolution.
[01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:40.658]  Members of Congress calling for banning free speech.
[01:48:40.999 --> 01:48:42.379]  What do you make of this, Roger Stone?
[01:48:43.916 --> 01:48:46.397]  Well Alex, I think it's pretty clear.
[01:48:46.417 --> 01:48:50.899]  You know, I'm a veteran of ten national presidential campaigns.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:49:02.425]  From Richard Dixon to Ronald Reagan to that great American patriot Bob Dole, who was never a member of either the Trilateral Commission or the Council on Foreign Relations, and of course Donald Trump.
[01:49:02.944 --> 01:49:11.416]  And I think the president's re-election looks very strong with one giant dark cloud on the horizon.
[01:49:11.536 --> 01:49:14.501]  And that horizon is internet censorship.
[01:49:16.539 --> 01:49:23.706]  2016 was the year in which the mainstream media lost their stranglehold, their monopoly, on political discourse in this country.
[01:49:24.066 --> 01:49:37.900]  They could no longer drive their fake news message because you had a vibrant, robust, alternative media based in the internet from which Donald Trump could counterattack, from which he could launch his counterpunches.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:45.005]  Without that, we'll go back to a time that CNN and MSNBC and ABC and CBS
[01:49:45.484 --> 01:49:49.986]  And NBC will be allowed to dominate the race from the beginning.
[01:49:50.386 --> 01:49:51.446]  And that's dangerous.
[01:49:51.967 --> 01:50:00.610]  They may not censor the president himself, although my guess is that he's actually reaching millions more people than we're actually told.
[01:50:00.930 --> 01:50:05.332]  And he too is probably being shadow banned on a more modest basis.
[01:50:05.832 --> 01:50:13.555]  But if you allow the deplatforming of all of his supporters on Facebook, on Twitter,
[01:50:14.105 --> 01:50:21.011]  On Instagram, places like InfoWars, you're taking away the amplification ability.
[01:50:21.031 --> 01:50:21.752]  Well sure, Roger.
[01:50:21.792 --> 01:50:31.601]  They've gone way beyond that to saying that the users can't say our names or share our information and banning words and terms like Communist China does.
[01:50:31.701 --> 01:50:39.108]  And now, I don't know if you read this, they literally say, you're allowed to organize violent acts including the killing of people.
[01:50:40.183 --> 01:50:42.444]  Now people say, well some antifa that works there did this.
[01:50:42.564 --> 01:50:43.124]  Exactly!
[01:50:43.805 --> 01:50:45.946]  There are mutinies going inside Big Tech.
[01:50:46.266 --> 01:50:50.768]  Even when the heads say don't do it, the left is so apoplectic, so insane.
[01:50:52.168 --> 01:50:59.951]  I have leftist members of my family who go to the press, while I'm getting ready to have to sue, and literally tell them 100% made up lies.
[01:51:00.952 --> 01:51:03.573]  And it's part of this Trump derangement syndrome, Roger.
[01:51:04.773 --> 01:51:19.666]  Well, also the other thing I've noticed, Alex, is when I post something that people like, and they seek to retweet it or repost it, they're immediately blocked and locked out of the system, like clockwork.
[01:51:20.342 --> 01:51:24.745]  So, look, this is the greatest single danger to Trump's re-election.
[01:51:25.225 --> 01:51:28.267]  This is the greatest single danger to his reform agenda.
[01:51:28.608 --> 01:51:31.810]  This is the greatest single danger to his legacy.
[01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:32.490]  I totally agree.
[01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:33.771]  And you can't say it on air.
[01:51:33.811 --> 01:51:34.411]  We've had talks.
[01:51:34.451 --> 01:51:34.852]  You've had...
[01:51:35.592 --> 01:51:37.895]  Major, you know, events with major members.
[01:51:38.395 --> 01:51:39.697]  Major members of the White House.
[01:51:40.237 --> 01:51:41.419]  Major members of the campaign.
[01:51:41.879 --> 01:51:46.024]  And you, to credit, got this social media thing going tomorrow.
[01:51:46.524 --> 01:51:49.147]  But I still hope this isn't just some pat on the head to people.
[01:51:49.447 --> 01:51:50.789]  We need action now!
[01:51:50.809 --> 01:51:52.030]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:51:53.164 --> 01:52:10.167]  Look, the people in the re-election campaign, and there's some very good people there, are well aware of my position, and hopefully they will adopt it, that internet censorship, along with the integrity and an honest election, are the two great obstacles to Trump's re-election.
[01:52:10.247 --> 01:52:13.267]  He's got an extraordinarily strong record to run on.
[01:52:13.728 --> 01:52:15.108]  Six million new jobs.
[01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:16.388]  650,000 new manufacturing jobs.
[01:52:16.408 --> 01:52:18.288]  224,000 jobs in the last quarter alone.
[01:52:22.830 --> 01:52:24.392]  Far beyond expectations.
[01:52:24.832 --> 01:52:27.996]  Unemployment at the lowest point since 1969.
[01:52:28.477 --> 01:52:33.222]  Wage growth at the fastest pace in American history.
[01:52:33.943 --> 01:52:40.971]  And reasserting ourselves around the globe, but not looking for more foreign wars to jump into.
[01:52:43.855 --> 01:52:47.698]  He puts out the olive branch because it never hurts to talk.
[01:52:48.138 --> 01:52:50.440]  He beats the dictator in North Korea.
[01:52:50.820 --> 01:53:05.693]  He gives up nothing, no concessions, no agreements, no pallets of cash like they did in the Obama and Clinton administrations, but keeping the talks going because you can only get to peace through negotiation.
[01:53:05.873 --> 01:53:10.397]  One thing I know, Donald Trump would rather make no deal than a bad deal.
[01:53:10.777 --> 01:53:15.921]  He will never make a bad deal for the United States, but he would like to get world peace.
[01:53:16.282 --> 01:53:24.388]  He would like to disarm what Bill Clinton called the greatest single danger to the future of America, a nuclear North Korea.
[01:53:24.869 --> 01:53:34.417]  So Trump's working for peace every day, and the peaceniks in the left wing of the Democratic Party do nothing but criticize him.
[01:53:34.437 --> 01:53:34.577]  Roger!
[01:53:35.037 --> 01:53:37.818]  He's even going after the ethanol subsidy scam.
[01:53:38.238 --> 01:53:41.239]  He's going after all the Republican pork barrel things.
[01:53:41.319 --> 01:53:44.079]  I mean, Trump is really trying to do what he said he'd do.
[01:53:44.139 --> 01:53:45.240]  He's gotten a lot done.
[01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:47.560]  And we know he's for real, because all hell's breaking loose.
[01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:52.462]  Thanks for giving us the exclusive inside on so much of what's happening, Roger.
[01:53:52.482 --> 01:53:57.063]  And congratulations on trailblazing so much of what's unfolded.
[01:53:58.092 --> 01:53:59.353]  Alex, it's great to be with you.
[01:53:59.393 --> 01:53:59.974]  Many thanks.
[01:54:00.054 --> 01:54:00.434]  Thank you.
[01:54:00.915 --> 01:54:01.995]  There goes Roger Stone.
[01:54:03.337 --> 01:54:04.157]  Really a great guy.
[01:54:05.658 --> 01:54:10.442]  The media demonizes him and lies about him, but he knows his stuff when it comes to politics and the world.
[01:54:10.462 --> 01:54:19.270]  Okay, we're going to start the next hour, and I'm going to air this Tommy Robinson interview from this morning that I was sitting there
[01:54:20.791 --> 01:54:24.192]  At home, with tears in my eyes, watching with David Knight.
[01:54:25.012 --> 01:54:28.633]  What he's facing, how the media's responded, how they demonize him, how they lie about him.
[01:54:29.113 --> 01:54:30.854]  That'll be the second and third segment.
[01:54:31.734 --> 01:54:41.357]  And then, we're going to have Norm Pattison with some huge constitutional developments and some victories that Infowars has had, that you've had, that you're not going to hear about anywhere else.
[01:54:42.037 --> 01:54:42.997]  That's really what this is about.
[01:54:43.517 --> 01:54:46.538]  Have you noticed how we're just all over the news constantly and the zeitgeist?
[01:54:47.498 --> 01:54:48.939]  Because we're at the center of the fight.
[01:54:49.019 --> 01:54:49.679]  This is the war.
[01:54:50.737 --> 01:54:52.878]  And you listening, and you watching in there as well.
[01:54:53.398 --> 01:55:06.984]  You know, obviously, it wasn't a rocket science event when last Fourth of July, which is just last week, Colin Kaepernick pulled that stunt, saying, I don't like American flags on Nike shoes.
[01:55:07.044 --> 01:55:08.625]  And Nike agreed and said, yes, they're hateful.
[01:55:09.045 --> 01:55:10.226]  Slave masters are bad.
[01:55:10.526 --> 01:55:12.167]  Betsy Ross loves the KKK.
[01:55:12.527 --> 01:55:16.229]  No, Betsy Ross was a famous abolitionist, one of the top abolitionists at the time.
[01:55:17.209 --> 01:55:18.750]  So an abolitionist created the American flag.
[01:55:20.171 --> 01:55:21.392]  It's the original 13 stars.
[01:55:21.612 --> 01:55:22.813]  Submission by George Washington.
[01:55:23.514 --> 01:55:24.815]  Well, it's not rocket science.
[01:55:24.855 --> 01:55:29.619]  I said, hey, let's put out a really good looking navy blue shirt that says America's back on the back.
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:31.400]  Infowars.com.
[01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:32.902]  On the front, Betsy Ross flag.
[01:55:33.382 --> 01:55:34.823]  And it says these colors don't run.
[01:55:35.944 --> 01:55:37.626]  There's another variant that says established 1776.
[01:55:37.866 --> 01:55:40.788]  And on the back, these colors don't run.
[01:55:40.848 --> 01:55:41.509]  Now, I figured
[01:55:43.365 --> 01:55:44.946]  That it would be a popular shirt.
[01:55:45.726 --> 01:55:47.507]  I mean, usually a really popular shirt, we sell like 5,000.
[01:55:47.627 --> 01:55:51.989]  It takes millions to run this place, so it's a drop in the barrel, but it gets the word out.
[01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:53.910]  And it triggers leftists.
[01:55:54.630 --> 01:55:59.693]  We had one shirt we sold 100,000 of, that was Hillary for prison, but half of those I sold at $5 apiece, that's cost.
[01:56:00.273 --> 01:56:07.015]  Well, these new shirts cost us $6, $7, $8, depending on the size, because they're that soft fabric, that really nice stretchable fabric.
[01:56:07.635 --> 01:56:10.556]  And then it costs $2 or $3 to print, depending on how much we put on it.
[01:56:10.896 --> 01:56:12.576]  So these are like $11, $12 shirts.
[01:56:13.236 --> 01:56:15.297]  Space Force costs us like $14.
[01:56:16.997 --> 01:56:26.940]  So when we're selling the Space Force shirt or the Betsy Ross shirt for $17.76, even though we're about to sell the $4,000 we printed, all shirts are $17.76.
[01:56:29.372 --> 01:56:30.613]  All shirts are $17.76.
[01:56:31.794 --> 01:56:36.217]  And some of these shirts that have printing on the front, the back, the sidearm cost $16.17.
[01:56:36.997 --> 01:56:39.339]  Again, the Space Force, they cost us like $14.
[01:56:41.024 --> 01:56:45.026]  Like I said, the Betsy Ross all together like nine or ten because the printing and it's got the expensive fabric.
[01:56:45.426 --> 01:56:51.749]  So these are nice designer shirts that then gives us like five bucks a shirt to help operate.
[01:56:51.809 --> 01:56:52.929]  And I need a lot of money.
[01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:55.551]  We've got big covert operations running.
[01:56:55.871 --> 01:56:58.032]  Obviously, my name isn't on for obvious reasons.
[01:56:58.232 --> 01:57:01.313]  We had covert operations running against the Globals before I ever got shadow banned.
[01:57:01.553 --> 01:57:02.134]  I knew it was coming.
[01:57:02.434 --> 01:57:03.854]  Why do you think I built this place?
[01:57:04.355 --> 01:57:08.857]  Why do you think Matt Drudge came here at the place that had done it and said everybody else should do it?
[01:57:09.537 --> 01:57:10.878]  Because we're in a war.
[01:57:11.238 --> 01:57:15.361]  We don't look at this as entertainment or fun or being cool or having the biggest house or a private jet.
[01:57:15.802 --> 01:57:18.624]  That money all went into the war, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:19.164 --> 01:57:21.346]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:24.264 --> 01:57:26.765]  We have the new special, 1776 Worldwide Specials.
[01:57:27.466 --> 01:57:32.808]  Tomorrow, we kick off 8 a.m., 34-hour broadcast, 1776 Worldwide.
[01:57:33.289 --> 01:57:41.273]  All the products are 75 to 25% off, and dozens of bestsellers are 1776!
[01:57:41.713 --> 01:57:41.273]  1776!
[01:57:42.253 --> 01:57:46.295]  The answer to the 1984 system is 1776 Worldwide!
[01:57:46.595 --> 01:57:51.178]  Take advantage and fund this war machine, and you've got my guarantee to take the enemy on!
[01:57:53.052 --> 01:58:04.285]  We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, crossed the continent, harnessed science, took to the skies, and soared into the heavens.
[01:58:04.986 --> 01:58:11.373]  Because we will never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us.
[01:58:16.656 --> 01:58:20.918]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free.
[01:58:21.658 --> 01:58:28.261]  We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny.
[01:58:28.941 --> 01:58:39.446]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same almighty God.
[01:58:51.328 --> 01:59:18.911]  From the banks of the Chesapeake, to the cliffs of California, from the humming shores of the Great Lakes, to the sand dunes of the Carolinas, from the fields of the Heartland, to the Everglades of Florida, the spirit of American independence will never fade, never fail, but will reign forever and ever and ever.
[01:59:23.305 --> 01:59:30.688]  And that's what Trump was going through, one by one, all the different examples in such a tiny time period from a historical, contextual perspective.
[01:59:30.968 --> 01:59:41.092]  And over, in just 200 years, one country took the lead in lighting the flame of liberty for everybody around the world in a wide range of contexts.
[01:59:41.472 --> 01:59:43.732]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[01:59:44.153 --> 01:59:46.453]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ.
[01:59:46.734 --> 01:59:47.574]  Full power!
[01:59:48.194 --> 01:59:50.175]  Damn the torpedoes, go straight at them!
[01:59:55.037 --> 01:59:59.121]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.661 --> 02:00:00.963]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.157 --> 02:00:17.587]  I'm here to say, and this is the reason why I came to see you, Alex, is you are one of the very few who are operating under this theory to be an independent American.
[02:00:17.607 --> 02:00:19.670]  In a big way.
[02:00:19.890 --> 02:00:21.592]  If your calling is media, fine.
[02:00:21.632 --> 02:00:23.473]  If your calling is sports, whatever it is.
[02:00:24.014 --> 02:00:25.576]  But you've got to be the greatest you can be.
[02:00:26.256 --> 02:00:26.616]  Now.
[02:00:27.056 --> 02:00:37.521]  I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos of these Facebooks and these tweets and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[02:00:38.161 --> 02:00:39.341]  This is ghetto.
[02:00:39.742 --> 02:00:40.502]  This is ghetto.
[02:00:40.542 --> 02:00:41.442]  This is corporate.
[02:00:41.462 --> 02:00:44.023]  They're taking your energy.
[02:00:44.503 --> 02:00:46.804]  They're taking your energy and you're getting nothing in return.
[02:00:47.184 --> 02:00:47.545]  Nothing.
[02:00:47.565 --> 02:00:48.805]  They're dumbing the language down.
[02:00:49.045 --> 02:00:50.946]  Twitter's designed to reduce the language.
[02:00:51.166 --> 02:00:53.027]  Directly out of 1984, it's Ingsoc.
[02:00:53.727 --> 02:00:57.189]  I had a Supreme Court Justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[02:00:57.209 --> 02:00:58.570]  He said, Matt, it's over for you.
[02:00:58.931 --> 02:01:01.132]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[02:01:01.412 --> 02:01:01.973]  You're out of there.
[02:01:02.193 --> 02:01:04.494]  They're gonna make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[02:01:04.835 --> 02:01:11.659]  To have a Supreme Court Justice say that to my face, that it's over, they've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[02:01:12.019 --> 02:01:13.320]  Time is not forever.
[02:01:13.661 --> 02:01:16.763]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life?
[02:01:17.583 --> 02:01:18.584]  Uh, rise and fall.
[02:01:18.804 --> 02:01:19.785]  There's not that many.
[02:01:19.905 --> 02:01:21.386]  It's a small amount.
[02:01:21.887 --> 02:01:27.451]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime.
[02:01:27.571 --> 02:01:27.791]  No.
[02:01:28.032 --> 02:01:28.832]  No, you can't.
[02:01:28.972 --> 02:01:30.874]  We're being enslaved now, and that's it.
[02:01:31.034 --> 02:01:35.978]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[02:01:36.258 --> 02:01:38.260]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:41.042]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[02:01:41.323 --> 02:01:42.103]  This is insane.
[02:01:42.183 --> 02:01:45.366]  And you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law.
[02:01:45.706 --> 02:01:47.927]  Now, remember just recently... We're getting it lined up with it.
[02:01:48.207 --> 02:01:50.648]  So, they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[02:01:50.668 --> 02:01:52.309]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:54.510]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[02:01:54.550 --> 02:02:05.294]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[02:02:08.024 --> 02:02:10.105]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:02:10.665 --> 02:02:15.906]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:02:22.888 --> 02:02:27.669]  That is what Matt Drudge said here almost four years ago, and has it not been proven completely true.
[02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:34.591]  Just as we went to the last break, I said, hey, get me these two guys from our camera crew together.
[02:02:34.611 --> 02:02:37.152]  I want to go out and shoot this important report today.
[02:02:38.547 --> 02:02:40.990]  And the producer, Pop Maren, they said they're in D.C.
[02:02:41.010 --> 02:02:46.416]  to cover the summit on Internet censorship.
[02:02:46.596 --> 02:02:47.677]  Oh, well, give me this person.
[02:02:48.198 --> 02:02:49.379]  Well, they're on vacation.
[02:02:49.399 --> 02:02:49.919]  Well-deserved.
[02:02:50.900 --> 02:02:53.383]  And I'm not complaining, but there's two ways to destroy us.
[02:02:53.443 --> 02:02:54.725]  Well, there's more than that, but two big ones.
[02:02:55.839 --> 02:03:01.705]  If the globalists can shut us down and sue us out of existence and censor us, or if you don't support.
[02:03:02.285 --> 02:03:08.031]  And again, I'm very thankful for all your support, but I need three or four more camera people.
[02:03:08.371 --> 02:03:10.253]  I need three or four more field reporters.
[02:03:11.274 --> 02:03:16.499]  I need to be able to put people in there and do other live shows.
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:19.623]  And there's a few new shows that are finally about to start in the next month.
[02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:22.381]  It's just been, we've been held back.
[02:03:23.022 --> 02:03:27.266]  And I got a lot of covert stuff where I see somebody who's already successful and they need help.
[02:03:27.626 --> 02:03:31.409]  Project Veritas, people like Tommy Robinson, but that's the tip of the iceberg.
[02:03:31.869 --> 02:03:36.934]  I've given money to over a hundred groups that I've seen kicking ass with no strings.
[02:03:37.694 --> 02:03:39.776]  Groups that are busting pedophile rings, all of it.
[02:03:39.896 --> 02:03:40.957]  And it's not about getting credit.
[02:03:41.117 --> 02:03:41.858]  I'm in a war.
[02:03:42.318 --> 02:03:44.140]  I'm totally committed to beating these people.
[02:03:45.768 --> 02:03:52.835]  And I don't want people like Frederica Wilson to win when she says, oh, we should take all Americans' free speech and lock them up and shut them up.
[02:03:53.616 --> 02:03:54.737]  So don't let her win.
[02:03:54.797 --> 02:04:03.767]  Go to InfoWarStore.com today and take advantage of the amazing specials and get the materiel to win the second American Revolution.
[02:04:04.627 --> 02:04:06.830]  Now, we're going to go to break.
[02:04:08.052 --> 02:04:11.614]  I'm going to come back and we're going to play this Tommy Robinson interview.
[02:04:12.174 --> 02:04:12.995]  Tommy came here.
[02:04:13.055 --> 02:04:13.895]  He begged for your help.
[02:04:14.055 --> 02:04:14.556]  You helped him.
[02:04:14.576 --> 02:04:15.256]  You spread the word.
[02:04:15.336 --> 02:04:16.116]  Drudge linked to it.
[02:04:16.897 --> 02:04:18.938]  The media put out this disinfo against Tommy.
[02:04:20.079 --> 02:04:21.419]  But Tommy didn't get a jury trial.
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:25.301]  And Tommy is the guy to first expose the giant child kidnapping rings.
[02:04:25.522 --> 02:04:26.022]  He's a hero.
[02:04:27.076 --> 02:04:29.697]  He could be a convicted bank robber, and if he helped do this, he'd be a hero.
[02:04:30.057 --> 02:04:34.198]  They got him on, like, some off-duty cop started a fight with him, so he beat the guy's ass.
[02:04:34.578 --> 02:04:38.339]  You've seen all the dozens of videos, the left attacking him, Antifa, you name it.
[02:04:38.399 --> 02:04:50.362]  The guy is a good guy, a wonderful guy, and he's facing two to three years in solitary confinement, no jury trial, which violates the law in England, and he needs political asylum here.
[02:04:51.977 --> 02:04:55.462]  I gotta say, David Knight, at the end of the interview, really said some of the most powerful stuff ever.
[02:04:55.882 --> 02:04:57.304]  So that's coming up for two segments.
[02:04:58.185 --> 02:05:00.789]  And then, more breaking information.
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:06.721]  The second American Revolution is happening now.
[02:05:07.061 --> 02:05:09.082]  It's worldwide against the globalists.
[02:05:09.342 --> 02:05:13.783]  The American system versus the anti-human, anti-God world government.
[02:05:14.384 --> 02:05:18.945]  Ladies and gentlemen, any war to be successful needs funding, and we make it easy.
[02:05:19.365 --> 02:05:23.507]  That's why we're launching our biggest sale yet, $17.76 worldwide.
[02:05:23.827 --> 02:05:26.568]  Bigger than our Christmas specials.
[02:05:27.048 --> 02:05:31.750]  75% off is the best deals, with a lot of our best-selling items at that price, down to 25% off.
[02:05:33.951 --> 02:05:39.636]  And on top of it, we have a dozen items including all apparel for $17.76.
[02:05:39.796 --> 02:05:49.585]  So stock up and fund the InfoWar today in the $17.76 worldwide special exclusively at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:05:49.885 --> 02:05:51.186]  I thank you for your support.
[02:05:51.547 --> 02:05:52.908]  The Globalists hope you don't.
[02:05:53.248 --> 02:05:56.151]  Whatever you do, choose what side you're on and take action.
[02:06:09.363 --> 02:06:10.405]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:10.485 --> 02:06:12.589]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:23.945 --> 02:06:26.927]  Tommy Robinson is facing certain death.
[02:06:27.347 --> 02:06:30.729]  It's been said that we're all Spartacus, we're all Tommy Robinson.
[02:06:30.770 --> 02:06:36.773]  They want to kill him because he exposed the British government's currency of kidnapped children.
[02:06:37.494 --> 02:06:44.819]  He couldn't come on my show today because he's having a potential last supper with his wife and his three children and family tonight.
[02:06:45.419 --> 02:06:46.520]  It's evening over there.
[02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:54.044]  But this morning, he came on with David Knight and gave a very powerful, poignant interview that I hope you'll share with everyone.
[02:06:54.624 --> 02:06:56.805]  We're about to post it at Infowars.com.
[02:06:56.985 --> 02:06:57.426]  Here it is.
[02:06:58.406 --> 02:07:04.309]  The Muslim gangs were actually being allowed to kidnap our daughters and take them from the age of 11, prostitute them, rape them.
[02:07:04.549 --> 02:07:06.731]  And when families ring the police, the police do nothing.
[02:07:07.411 --> 02:07:13.014]  People didn't believe it until we had a government in-depth report and research into a town called Rotherham.
[02:07:13.644 --> 02:07:21.427]  In this small town, 1,400 children were identified as being victims of these Muslim paedophile gangs.
[02:07:21.447 --> 02:07:26.329]  20% of the male Muslim population of that town is currently under police investigation for rape.
[02:07:26.349 --> 02:07:26.329]  20%!
[02:07:26.789 --> 02:07:33.171]  The guy with this agenda and the government, they don't want the British public to be aware of this.
[02:07:33.775 --> 02:07:37.758]  They would do anything they can to cover it up, and they did for 20 to 30 years.
[02:07:38.198 --> 02:07:48.825]  When I formed a street movement of tens of thousands of people marching in towns and cities, screaming about our daughters being taken, only then did the media then report.
[02:07:49.125 --> 02:07:50.206]  The media were aware of it.
[02:07:50.266 --> 02:07:51.747]  They were all aware of these crimes.
[02:07:52.087 --> 02:07:53.188]  Politicians were aware of it.
[02:07:53.288 --> 02:07:54.089]  No one reported.
[02:07:54.569 --> 02:08:03.635]  We basically broke down political correctness, we smashed it in the face, and we went out on the streets screaming and telling the world what they're doing to our daughters in these towns and cities.
[02:08:04.115 --> 02:08:13.637]  Now, just so people understand the scale of the problem, 90% of the convictions of these gangs for raping these young children are Muslim men.
[02:08:14.117 --> 02:08:19.338]  Muslim men only make up 4 or 5% of the British population, or Muslims do, 2% Muslim men.
[02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:20.498]  But they're responsible.
[02:08:20.738 --> 02:08:27.859]  Now, I went to Leeds Crown Court and what we see now is where the police have had to start making arrests, they've started arresting them all over the country.
[02:08:28.339 --> 02:08:31.600]  But what the judges do straight away is they put a report restriction.
[02:08:32.265 --> 02:08:35.047]  So 30 men will be on trial and no one can talk about it.
[02:08:35.587 --> 02:08:36.908]  None of me you're allowed to talk about.
[02:08:37.068 --> 02:08:39.510]  I speak about real issues that affect us in our towns and cities.
[02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:41.511]  And I'm loved by the people.
[02:08:42.232 --> 02:08:43.072]  And they hate that.
[02:08:43.112 --> 02:08:44.573]  So this is now the ultimate.
[02:08:44.813 --> 02:08:46.194]  The ultimate is to get rid of me.
[02:08:46.635 --> 02:08:49.516]  I'll be put in prison for... Do you know it's a civil offence?
[02:08:49.576 --> 02:08:50.897]  This is a civil offence.
[02:08:51.418 --> 02:08:52.398]  I was not allowed a jury.
[02:08:52.719 --> 02:08:58.282]  The Magna Carta of Common Law says that if you can face more than six months in prison you'll be tried by 12 members of your peers.
[02:08:58.622 --> 02:09:00.564]  The reason for that is for fair justice.
[02:09:01.158 --> 02:09:01.978]  You don't have a jury.
[02:09:02.199 --> 02:09:02.939]  Let's underscore that.
[02:09:02.979 --> 02:09:07.161]  You don't have... Trial by jury is one of the foundations of British common law.
[02:09:07.241 --> 02:09:08.042]  Trial by jury.
[02:09:08.142 --> 02:09:08.682]  Hard won.
[02:09:09.142 --> 02:09:11.063]  And that's now been swept aside in your case, right?
[02:09:11.443 --> 02:09:12.444]  I wasn't allowed a jury.
[02:09:13.124 --> 02:09:14.465]  I wasn't allowed a jury.
[02:09:14.725 --> 02:09:23.729]  So this is the only thing that they could get through the back door of the Attorney General's government, they could bring it through the back door, to then sentence a man to two years in prison with no jury.
[02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:26.091]  I've been convicted by an appointed judge.
[02:09:26.391 --> 02:09:28.492]  A judge who was appointed to my position two weeks ago.
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:37.161]  Joining us from the UK is Tommy Robinson.
[02:09:37.181 --> 02:09:38.142]  Thank you for joining us, Tommy.
[02:09:38.942 --> 02:09:41.224]  Thank you, David.
[02:09:41.244 --> 02:09:43.505]  Tommy, tell the audience a little bit about what happened.
[02:09:43.545 --> 02:09:45.806]  This goes back to May 18th.
[02:09:46.547 --> 02:09:56.113]  Tell us what happened on that day, but give us a little bit of a background as to what led up to that with the grooming gangs in the UK that you were trying to report on as a citizen journalist.
[02:09:57.099 --> 02:10:02.104]  So on that day, I was reporting outside Leeds Crown Court on just another gang.
[02:10:02.384 --> 02:10:05.888]  We've seen the industrialised rape of a generation of our daughters.
[02:10:06.609 --> 02:10:11.093]  There's been a conspiracy of silence by political leaders, community leaders, religious leaders.
[02:10:11.433 --> 02:10:12.294]  They've all let it happen.
[02:10:12.875 --> 02:10:17.079]  And I've been banging my head and screaming and literally crying about this for over a decade.
[02:10:17.702 --> 02:10:28.389]  And when we first started telling people the stories, that Muslim gangs were actually being allowed to kidnap our daughters and take them from the age of 11, prostitute them, rape them, and when families ring the police, the police do nothing.
[02:10:29.070 --> 02:10:34.673]  People didn't believe it, until we had a government in-depth report and research into a town called Rotherham.
[02:10:35.334 --> 02:10:41.498]  In this small town, 1,400 children were identified as being victims of these Muslim paedophile gangs.
[02:10:43.113 --> 02:10:47.725]  20% of the male Muslim population of that town is currently under police investigation for rape.
[02:10:47.745 --> 02:10:47.725]  20%.
[02:10:47.805 --> 02:10:47.965]  Wow.
[02:10:50.942 --> 02:11:15.466]  So, when people understand the level of this crime, and then these gangs have been, there's 72 towns and cities now, they operate the same, their actions are the same, the way they groom the victims are the same, they prostitute and take the girls, they kidnap them and remove them from one town to another, from one city to another, and in every one of these towns and cities, the police stood by, the government stood by, they knew it was happening, they done nothing.
[02:11:15.946 --> 02:11:16.928]  The reason they've done nothing?
[02:11:17.248 --> 02:11:19.531]  Because they're scared of being deemed as racist.
[02:11:19.811 --> 02:11:24.156]  Because all the perpetrators were Pakistani Muslims, and all of the victims were young English white girls.
[02:11:24.277 --> 02:11:29.563]  So because they're Muslim, they get a pass on this racketeering, on this organized crime of sex games?
[02:11:30.144 --> 02:11:32.607]  We have this globalist agenda of open borders.
[02:11:33.247 --> 02:11:51.176]  And then what we do, or what I began to do, was tell the reality of actually what it's like when you open the borders to the third world, and when you import millions of people who are from a different culture, who have completely different views on women, tolerance of women, their views on different people from different faiths, and we see genuine hatred and hostility.
[02:11:51.736 --> 02:11:52.976]  I started telling the public about that.
[02:11:53.096 --> 02:11:58.359]  Now, of course, the globalist agenda and the government, they don't want the British public to be aware of this.
[02:11:58.979 --> 02:12:02.942]  They would do anything they can to cover it up, and they did for 20 to 30 years.
[02:12:03.402 --> 02:12:14.029]  When I formed a street movement of tens of thousands of people marching in towns and cities, screaming about our daughters being taken, only then did the media then report.
[02:12:14.329 --> 02:12:15.410]  The media were aware of it.
[02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:16.951]  They're all aware of these crimes.
[02:12:17.291 --> 02:12:18.392]  Politicians were aware of it.
[02:12:18.492 --> 02:12:19.293]  No one reported.
[02:12:19.773 --> 02:12:28.819]  We basically broke down political correctness, we smashed it in the face, and we went out on the street screaming and telling the world what they're doing to our daughters in these towns and cities.
[02:12:29.319 --> 02:12:38.822]  Now, just so people understand the scale of the problem, 90% of the convictions of these gangs for raping these young children are Muslim men.
[02:12:39.322 --> 02:12:44.544]  Muslim men only make up 4 or 5% of the British population, or Muslims do, 2% Muslim men.
[02:12:45.064 --> 02:12:45.704]  But they're responsible.
[02:12:45.924 --> 02:12:53.067]  Now, I went to Leeds Crown Court and what we see now is where the police have had to start making arrests, they've started arresting them all over the country.
[02:12:53.547 --> 02:12:56.788]  But what the judges do straight away is they put a report restriction.
[02:12:57.469 --> 02:13:00.250]  So 30 men will be on trial and no one can talk about it.
[02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:02.151]  No media allowed to talk about it.
[02:13:02.591 --> 02:13:06.693]  So what I've done is I started looking and researching all these cases, as I've done for years.
[02:13:07.473 --> 02:13:09.394]  I looked, I knew there was a case on in Leeds.
[02:13:09.674 --> 02:13:14.476]  I'd heard there was a report restriction, but there's no national website to check if there's a report restriction.
[02:13:14.596 --> 02:13:15.056]  There's nothing.
[02:13:15.603 --> 02:13:20.766]  So I'd heard, I'd travelled up to Leeds, I went into the court and said, is there a reporting restriction on this case?
[02:13:21.206 --> 02:13:25.768]  I was told by the man who'd come to court and testified that he wasn't aware of one, he didn't know.
[02:13:25.788 --> 02:13:31.031]  I then looked, at that point I looked on the court website, where the list of names are.
[02:13:31.591 --> 02:13:35.573]  And in that list of names, there was no mention of a reporting restriction.
[02:13:35.613 --> 02:13:36.154]  No mention at all.
[02:13:36.654 --> 02:13:40.656]  And on the judiciary's own website, the government's judiciary website,
[02:13:41.848 --> 02:13:50.470]  There's a 47-page document that gives the guidelines for media and journalists.
[02:13:50.990 --> 02:13:54.311]  This is the guidelines for contempt of court for reporting restrictions.
[02:13:54.971 --> 02:14:02.553]  So I previously paid myself to go to the leading law firm in London to get training because I didn't qualify as a journalist.
[02:14:02.933 --> 02:14:03.934]  I'm a citizen journalist.
[02:14:04.234 --> 02:14:09.595]  So I went for training on contempt of court to understand the laws and boundaries of what I can and can't say, where I can say it.
[02:14:10.658 --> 02:14:15.982]  In my training that I had on reporting restrictions, I was already aware that a judge has no power.
[02:14:16.882 --> 02:14:17.923]  And this is still now.
[02:14:17.983 --> 02:14:33.794]  If you go on the website now, Google reporting restrictions criminal courts, go to page 27, you will read, a judge has no power under section 4.2 of reporting restriction to put any restrictions on information already in the public domain.
[02:14:34.514 --> 02:14:37.837]  So when I got to Leeds, I was aware of a lot of the details of this case.
[02:14:38.237 --> 02:14:39.558]  I was aware of the previous verdicts.
[02:14:40.157 --> 02:14:54.381]  But to make sure that I couldn't fulfill the law, even though there was no mention of reporting restriction anywhere, the guidelines say that if there's a reporting restriction, it must be on the website, it must be on the courtroom door, it must be on the screen in the courtroom.
[02:14:55.382 --> 02:14:56.202]  It was nowhere.
[02:14:56.362 --> 02:15:01.604]  It's been proven that they had failed three procedures to alert people of the reporting restriction.
[02:15:02.264 --> 02:15:09.146]  But I still stuck to the training that I'd received that says only reveal information that's in the public domain.
[02:15:09.892 --> 02:15:11.013]  Do you know what they said in court?
[02:15:11.453 --> 02:15:13.354]  Do you know what they said, David?
[02:15:13.374 --> 02:15:14.134]  No, what did they say?
[02:15:14.435 --> 02:15:17.336]  That information on the Judiciary website is wrong.
[02:15:18.097 --> 02:15:35.006]  Now, if you go now, if you go now and look on the Judiciary website, there is a foreword, a foreword by the Lord Chief Justice himself, and he thanks legal chambers for the legal accuracy of the Judiciary website.
[02:15:35.686 --> 02:15:38.688]  So, and this is where they just make it up as they go along.
[02:15:39.096 --> 02:15:43.957]  Now folks, it gets really powerful when he comes back about last dinner with his children, what he's facing, what they've done to him in prison.
[02:15:43.977 --> 02:15:46.138]  But understand, this is how they kill journalism.
[02:15:46.858 --> 02:15:49.239]  He went and covered a trial outside.
[02:15:49.739 --> 02:15:52.800]  He's facing years in solitary confinement, no jury trial.
[02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:57.001]  When the law in the UK is, more than six months in jail, you get a jury trial.
[02:15:57.381 --> 02:15:58.141]  This is tyranny.
[02:16:08.530 --> 02:16:10.431]  My name is Tommy Robinson.
[02:16:10.631 --> 02:16:19.355]  Today I'm calling on the help of Donald Trump, his administration and the Republican Party to grant me and my family political asylum in the United States of America.
[02:16:19.495 --> 02:16:22.917]  I'm standing today before you to make my case of political persecution.
[02:16:23.673 --> 02:16:28.377]  I have been found guilty of what is the equivalent of exercising First Amendment rights.
[02:16:29.198 --> 02:16:31.760]  Benjamin Franklin had the foresight to know this.
[02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:37.384]  Whoever would overthrow the liberty of a nation must begin by subduing the freeness of speech.
[02:16:37.584 --> 02:16:49.694]  For more than 10 years I've been proactive voice, highlighting the industrialised grooming, the pimping, the beating and the raping of young vulnerable British girls up and down the length and breadth of my once great country.
[02:16:49.874 --> 02:16:50.795]  I'm an English man.
[02:16:51.275 --> 02:16:56.039]  A British citizen who loves my country and it hurts me to have to say I have no future here.
[02:16:56.779 --> 02:16:59.461]  The only future that lies for me is death.
[02:17:00.542 --> 02:17:06.346]  Death at the hands of an establishment who will feed me to Islamic gangs of jihadis within the prison system.
[02:17:07.246 --> 02:17:09.188]  I have 48 hours before my sentencing.
[02:17:10.012 --> 02:17:14.859]  I previously spent three months in solitary confinement for journalism, for breaking no law.
[02:17:15.059 --> 02:17:19.646]  The reality is, and I urge you, please, get your lawyers to look through this case.
[02:17:19.946 --> 02:17:22.590]  You will expose and see complete corruption.
[02:17:23.323 --> 02:17:25.584]  I'm being found guilty when I've drunk no laws.
[02:17:26.024 --> 02:17:28.565]  I've not been tried by my peers.
[02:17:28.585 --> 02:17:31.667]  Twelve members of the British public, that's the Magna Carta.
[02:17:32.067 --> 02:17:33.027]  That's common law.
[02:17:33.547 --> 02:17:39.170]  Common law is if members of my peers, if the British public find me guilty, I'll accept my fate.
[02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:40.090]  I'm not being tried.
[02:17:40.510 --> 02:17:42.351]  I think this is a backdoor ruling.
[02:17:42.831 --> 02:17:47.212]  In order for the government to silence me, imprison me, and inevitably have me killed.
[02:17:47.372 --> 02:17:52.393]  To understand the level of political correctness that has infected this once great nation.
[02:17:52.833 --> 02:17:54.453]  We are imprisoning journalists.
[02:17:54.733 --> 02:17:56.534]  And our media celebrate it.
[02:17:56.614 --> 02:17:58.254]  But this is a direct appeal.
[02:17:58.394 --> 02:18:01.474]  On behalf of my family, we love the United States.
[02:18:02.415 --> 02:18:03.575]  I have no future here.
[02:18:03.955 --> 02:18:04.475]  It's inevitable.
[02:18:04.495 --> 02:18:06.475]  I will be murdered, I will be killed.
[02:18:06.495 --> 02:18:10.076]  And I will be imprisoned on Thursday for journalism.
[02:18:11.235 --> 02:18:13.801]  We talk about North Korea, we talk about China, we talk about Russia.
[02:18:14.282 --> 02:18:15.204]  Our freedoms are gone.
[02:18:15.746 --> 02:18:16.888]  Our free speech is gone.
[02:18:17.329 --> 02:18:17.670]  It's gone.
[02:18:17.730 --> 02:18:19.214]  We live in a post-free speech era.
[02:18:19.858 --> 02:18:24.402]  And exactly the same, what they've inflicted in this nation, I know they want to do to yours.
[02:18:24.943 --> 02:18:27.785]  I know they want to take your freedoms, they want to change your constitution.
[02:18:28.025 --> 02:18:30.768]  I know there's people who would take away your rights tomorrow.
[02:18:31.108 --> 02:18:33.910]  The difference is, they want to do it to you in America.
[02:18:34.171 --> 02:18:35.191]  They've done it to us.
[02:18:35.832 --> 02:18:36.793]  They've done it to us.
[02:18:37.373 --> 02:18:39.235]  Our free speech is gone and it's celebrated.
[02:18:39.255 --> 02:18:43.559]  It's celebrated by the people in power, who rule over us, the globalists.
[02:18:43.759 --> 02:18:44.580]  It's celebrated.
[02:18:45.436 --> 02:18:47.918]  It's celebrated when a journalist is being imprisoned.
[02:18:48.578 --> 02:18:51.220]  The media, they're not journalists, they're activists.
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:19:00.786]  If this was happening to a journalist in any other country, in China, in Russia, in North Korea, human rights lawyers would be fighting to defend them.
[02:19:01.026 --> 02:19:04.848]  And what I realise now is that my government don't care if the world's watching.
[02:19:04.928 --> 02:19:06.469]  They don't care if they're breaking the law.
[02:19:06.569 --> 02:19:07.150]  They don't care.
[02:19:07.170 --> 02:19:10.011]  And they actually don't give a damn what the people actually want or vote for.
[02:19:10.091 --> 02:19:14.134]  They don't care about the British justice system looks and actually joke across this world.
[02:19:14.674 --> 02:19:16.536]  All they care about is getting what they want.
[02:19:16.917 --> 02:19:20.521]  We are run by nothing but a globalist dictatorship.
[02:19:20.561 --> 02:19:24.265]  They moan about Russia, they moan about China, they moan about the clampdown on free speech.
[02:19:24.445 --> 02:19:26.868]  They're the biggest bunch of hypocrites walking this planet.
[02:19:27.489 --> 02:19:30.412]  They are traitors that are ruining my beautiful country.
[02:19:30.612 --> 02:19:33.916]  They're removing our fundamental freedoms step by step, day by day.
[02:19:33.976 --> 02:19:35.298]  Every day we're losing our freedoms.
[02:19:36.067 --> 02:19:44.634]  I want to make a genuine appeal to President Trump, to the Republican Party, please consider me and my family for political asylum.
[02:19:45.215 --> 02:19:56.545]  The British state's appeasement to Islam, the unrestricted waves of migrants into this country means that they are deliberately persecuting and illegally imprisoning anyone who speaks out against their globalist agenda.
[02:20:06.290 --> 02:20:10.993]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:13.914 --> 02:20:16.155]  Every bit of information I read was in the public domain.
[02:20:16.695 --> 02:20:26.981]  I was taken off the street there and then, and I was in prison for 13 months without any due process, without asking if I was guilty or not guilty, without a trial, without even being told what I'd done.
[02:20:27.121 --> 02:20:29.442]  So they took me off the street instantly, put me in prison.
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:31.921]  Now, a Free Tommy movement grew.
[02:20:32.382 --> 02:20:35.204]  They tried to prevent the public from even knowing I was in prison.
[02:20:35.624 --> 02:20:46.011]  I'm thankful and still grateful to everyone in America, everyone in Australia, everyone in Canada, who, because of reporting restrictions they've in place, they've in place these reporting restrictions that no one could be told what happened to me.
[02:20:46.472 --> 02:20:48.993]  Now, because of the foreign media interest in this,
[02:20:50.837 --> 02:20:52.477]  A free Tommy movement grew.
[02:20:53.058 --> 02:20:55.818]  Then there was a campaign and legal fund to get me out.
[02:20:56.498 --> 02:20:57.959]  We got an appeal after two and a half months.
[02:20:58.439 --> 02:21:00.039]  I spent two and a half months in solitary confinement.
[02:21:00.359 --> 02:21:01.559]  I lost 40 pounds in weight.
[02:21:02.660 --> 02:21:04.280]  I was then released from prison.
[02:21:05.160 --> 02:21:09.301]  And they accepted, in the highest court in our land, they accepted that everything they'd done was wrong.
[02:21:09.641 --> 02:21:10.281]  It was flawed.
[02:21:10.581 --> 02:21:11.682]  I was released for this reason.
[02:21:12.542 --> 02:21:14.102]  They then took me back to the Old Bailey.
[02:21:14.282 --> 02:21:15.363]  I went before another judge.
[02:21:15.643 --> 02:21:17.203]  I produced my evidence of statement.
[02:21:17.941 --> 02:21:19.621]  My statement of evidence?
[02:21:19.661 --> 02:21:21.182]  He kicked it back to the government again.
[02:21:21.202 --> 02:21:24.442]  The Attorney General sat on it for five months.
[02:21:25.503 --> 02:21:40.606]  Only after I produced a documentary which categorically proved evidence with undercover footage that the BBC programme Panorama was inventing news, fake news, creating sexual allegations against myself, I showed it all in the biggest expose of the BBC this country's seen.
[02:21:40.906 --> 02:21:46.367]  I'll be sent to prison tomorrow as a journalist for reporting the crime of journalism.
[02:21:48.109 --> 02:21:54.731]  You give asylum to Cubans, you give asylum to people who are journalists, my life is in danger.
[02:21:55.271 --> 02:21:57.492]  It's not a joke, it's seriously in danger.
[02:21:57.732 --> 02:22:03.333]  The lies that are told about me, I have exposed and embarrassed the British government and the establishment.
[02:22:03.373 --> 02:22:06.614]  The establishment who are intent on the destruction of our culture and our nation.
[02:22:07.234 --> 02:22:10.238]  All of these issues, I've embarrassed them by highlighting the crimes.
[02:22:10.278 --> 02:22:13.341]  I've become the most watched journalist in the UK, and that's scared them.
[02:22:13.802 --> 02:22:19.589]  And I terrify the establishment, and my support that grew, terrified, because I speak the truth with honesty.
[02:22:19.889 --> 02:22:24.314]  I speak about real issues that affect us in our towns and cities, and I'm loved by the people.
[02:22:25.043 --> 02:22:27.344]  And they hate that, so this is now the ultimate.
[02:22:27.625 --> 02:22:28.965]  The ultimate is to get rid of me.
[02:22:29.446 --> 02:22:32.328]  I'll be put in prison for... Do you know it's a civil offence?
[02:22:32.388 --> 02:22:33.708]  This is a civil offence.
[02:22:34.249 --> 02:22:35.189]  I was not allowed a jury.
[02:22:35.530 --> 02:22:41.093]  The Magna Carta of Common Law says that if you can face more than six months in prison, you'll be tried by 12 members of your peers.
[02:22:41.433 --> 02:22:43.374]  The reason for that is for fair justice.
[02:22:43.955 --> 02:22:44.795]  You don't have a jury.
[02:22:45.015 --> 02:22:45.776]  Let's underscore that.
[02:22:45.796 --> 02:22:49.978]  You don't have... Trial by jury is one of the foundations of British common law.
[02:22:50.058 --> 02:22:50.879]  Trial by jury.
[02:22:50.959 --> 02:22:51.519]  Hard won.
[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:53.861]  And that's now been swept aside in your case, right?
[02:22:54.266 --> 02:22:55.247]  I wasn't allowed a jury.
[02:22:55.928 --> 02:22:57.270]  I wasn't allowed a jury.
[02:22:57.531 --> 02:23:06.543]  So this is the only thing that they could get through the back door, the Attorney General's government, they could bring it through the back door to then sentence a man to up to two years in prison with no jury.
[02:23:07.124 --> 02:23:11.330]  I've been convicted by an appointed judge, a judge who was appointed to a position two weeks ago.
[02:23:12.142 --> 02:23:14.104]  I pointed to her position two weeks ago.
[02:23:14.605 --> 02:23:17.328]  She has been appointed and she's about to... And do you know what?
[02:23:17.548 --> 02:23:18.469]  Anyone can look at this.
[02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:23.695]  Look at the video of what I announced on Leeds Crown Court and you will see the lies yourself in what the judge is saying.
[02:23:24.136 --> 02:23:30.223]  With careful examination, this case proves the corruption of the judicial system in the UK.
[02:23:30.843 --> 02:23:43.251]  It proves the lies being propagated and told, the lies being put out in sentences, which are then spread around the world by the corporate, globalist media, the fake news media, which are lying to the public about who I am, the man I am, the crime I've committed.
[02:23:43.732 --> 02:23:45.373]  I didn't lay a prejudice to any jury.
[02:23:45.653 --> 02:23:46.514]  That's been proven.
[02:23:46.814 --> 02:23:49.195]  The lies that are being said, I've committed no crime.
[02:23:49.235 --> 02:23:50.116]  It's a non-crime.
[02:23:50.616 --> 02:23:56.778]  And I bet I'd be locked up and in prison and probably murdered at the hands of ISIS terrorists who are in control of our prison system.
[02:23:57.058 --> 02:23:58.579]  This is a warning to the United States.
[02:23:58.619 --> 02:24:00.500]  Your prison systems will be used.
[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:10.603]  The most weak and vulnerable people in your society, the people who have been wronged all their life, the poorest people living in poverty, who then end up in prison when they're weak and they're vulnerable.
[02:24:11.003 --> 02:24:13.304]  An ideology will inset in that prison system.
[02:24:13.564 --> 02:24:16.065]  It will grow and it will breed and it's happening in ours.
[02:24:16.305 --> 02:24:19.166]  They've taken over our entire prison system.
[02:24:19.606 --> 02:24:22.747]  Car thieves are going into jail and they're coming out radical jihadis.
[02:24:23.327 --> 02:24:25.948]  That's going to happen to yours and nothing's being done to prevent it.
[02:24:26.188 --> 02:24:31.750]  And I'm going to be fed like a lamb to slaughter in that prison system that's controlled by jihadis.
[02:24:32.350 --> 02:24:33.370]  It's controlled by them.
[02:24:33.690 --> 02:24:34.490]  And I'm a journalist.
[02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:35.611]  I'm a man who loves my country.
[02:24:35.651 --> 02:24:36.471]  I love free speech.
[02:24:37.271 --> 02:24:40.152]  I've been convicted for exercising your First Amendment.
[02:24:40.746 --> 02:24:47.829]  If you care about freedom, if you care, you're giving asylum to people from different cultures from you who don't even love your country.
[02:24:48.289 --> 02:24:49.870]  I love the United States of America.
[02:24:50.410 --> 02:24:51.330]  I love Donald Trump.
[02:24:51.490 --> 02:24:52.571]  I absolutely love him.
[02:24:52.911 --> 02:24:55.792]  If there's one person I admire more than anyone in the world, it's that man.
[02:24:56.152 --> 02:24:57.453]  It's a worldwide war for freedom.
[02:24:57.873 --> 02:24:58.473]  And we're losing.
[02:24:58.793 --> 02:24:59.373]  We're losing.
[02:24:59.433 --> 02:25:00.534]  We've lost it in England.
[02:25:00.554 --> 02:25:00.974]  We've lost it.
[02:25:00.994 --> 02:25:01.754]  We've lost free speech.
[02:25:02.194 --> 02:25:02.715]  We've lost it.
[02:25:02.755 --> 02:25:03.035]  It's gone.
[02:25:03.515 --> 02:25:05.256]  And now we've lost the freedom of the press.
[02:25:05.696 --> 02:25:06.036]  It's gone.
[02:25:06.556 --> 02:25:07.997]  And the reality, we haven't even got democracy.
[02:25:08.037 --> 02:25:08.597]  Look at Brexit.
[02:25:09.201 --> 02:25:11.522]  We haven't even got democracy and people are waking up and realising that.
[02:25:11.943 --> 02:25:13.144]  Unfortunately, I'm going to have to go.
[02:25:13.284 --> 02:25:14.344]  I've got to collect my kids from school.
[02:25:15.145 --> 02:25:16.486]  This is my last night with my children.
[02:25:16.506 --> 02:25:25.451]  I'm going to have to kiss my kids goodbye with the inevitable outcome that I could die in this prison sentence for asking Muslim paedophiles how they feel about their verdict.
[02:25:25.831 --> 02:25:26.852]  Causing them anxiety.
[02:25:27.172 --> 02:25:27.833]  That's the reality.
[02:25:28.413 --> 02:25:32.954]  Well, I'm so sorry to hear that happening, and again, I know that you want to spend as much time with your kids as possible.
[02:25:33.694 --> 02:25:37.295]  Very serious situation, and we'll do everything that we can to draw attention to this.
[02:25:38.136 --> 02:25:39.296]  I do not want to see this happen.
[02:25:39.356 --> 02:25:41.076]  It's horrible what's happening in the UK.
[02:25:41.416 --> 02:25:42.797]  It's being done here in the United States as well.
[02:25:42.837 --> 02:25:43.437]  Thank you, Tommy.
[02:25:43.777 --> 02:25:45.197]  Again, you can find him, TR News.
[02:25:45.277 --> 02:25:54.600]  What Tommy Robinson was pointing out is that he was at the nexus of this fraud that is being perpetrated by the people who have opened up our borders.
[02:25:55.660 --> 02:26:10.353]  Because they pretend that they are all about defending women, and yet they bring in people with cultures, foreign cultures, that do everything they can to treat women as chattel property, running rape gangs and so forth.
[02:26:10.413 --> 02:26:11.995]  And that's what they don't want people to understand.
[02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:23.924]  They don't want, as I've said many times in the past, you've got the Democrats here saying, oh look, you can't say anything about Islam now on social media, they're now a protected class of people.
[02:26:23.964 --> 02:26:29.410]  They say, well this is general, no criticism of any religious groups, don't tell me they're going to protect
[02:26:30.091 --> 02:26:32.091]  Christians from being criticized by LGBT.
[02:26:32.431 --> 02:26:34.692]  We don't want their protection, quite frankly.
[02:26:34.732 --> 02:26:36.052]  We can handle the criticism.
[02:26:36.872 --> 02:26:43.333]  I don't need to be protected from criticism by atheists, or criticism by the LGBT, or criticism by Muslims.
[02:26:44.033 --> 02:26:45.534]  And I don't think that they should be protected.
[02:26:45.734 --> 02:26:49.654]  If I have any criticisms to say about what they're doing, or about their culture.
[02:26:50.214 --> 02:26:52.775]  But of course our culture has to be destroyed.
[02:26:53.435 --> 02:26:54.655]  And that's what they're doing with this.
[02:26:55.255 --> 02:26:58.336]  They don't want people to see what is ultimately going to happen.
[02:26:59.105 --> 02:27:03.080]  I said this when I was covering the DNC back in 2016.
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:04.304]  Went there for their convention.
[02:27:05.219 --> 02:27:16.223]  And I said, look at this, you've got Hillary Clinton, and they're talking about women's rights, and feminism, and gay rights, and then they bring up people who support Sharia law.
[02:27:16.963 --> 02:27:19.905]  I said, these two things are going to be an explosive mix.
[02:27:20.465 --> 02:27:31.149]  And it is inevitable that the kind of things that are happening in the UK now, as Tommy Robinson pointed out, Muslim men, 4-5% of the population, but 90% of the convictions of these sex gangs,
[02:27:31.969 --> 02:27:34.392]  Uh, that are grooming and kidnapping women there.
[02:27:34.412 --> 02:27:36.414]  Uh, it is a cultural thing.
[02:27:37.475 --> 02:27:38.836]  And they don't want you to see that connection.
[02:27:38.996 --> 02:27:40.378]  They don't want you to see what's happening.
[02:27:40.558 --> 02:27:42.820]  And it is a kangaroo court proceeding.
[02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:49.427]  You know, they don't have a First Amendment in the UK, but they have a cherished tradition of trial by jury.
[02:27:50.672 --> 02:27:57.634]  Our courts, our judiciary in this country have managed to gaslight the American people about how, oh, you don't want jury trials.
[02:27:57.654 --> 02:27:58.794]  They gaslight juries.
[02:27:58.834 --> 02:28:00.454]  Juries don't even know if you have a jury.
[02:28:00.594 --> 02:28:02.995]  All right, David Knight knocks it out of the park.
[02:28:03.055 --> 02:28:04.895]  The full interview is a few minutes left.
[02:28:04.995 --> 02:28:07.376]  It's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:28:07.416 --> 02:28:12.237]  It's Tommy Robinson's last interview before facing prison for journalism.
[02:28:12.537 --> 02:28:13.317]  Please get it out.
[02:28:13.938 --> 02:28:14.878]  It's very important.
[02:28:15.658 --> 02:28:16.960]  There it is for TV viewers.
[02:28:17.521 --> 02:28:22.969]  We have Alex Acosta, who's one of the secretaries, is at labor under Trump.
[02:28:23.389 --> 02:28:28.176]  The only connection to Trump and Epstein is that under
[02:28:29.577 --> 02:28:39.024]  A previous administration, this guy went along with the FBI's directive to basically let Epstein off because he was working for Robert Mueller, who's a bipartisan blackmailer.
[02:28:39.925 --> 02:28:41.626]  And so, we've got his press conference coming up.
[02:28:41.666 --> 02:28:43.768]  As soon as it goes live, we'll take the first part of it.
[02:28:44.168 --> 02:28:51.594]  Norm Pattis, constitutional lawyer, is going to pop in with a big court victory we have that mainstream media doesn't want you to know about, and so much more.
[02:28:51.654 --> 02:28:55.617]  But whatever you do, remember, InfoWars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[02:28:55.697 --> 02:28:56.398]  Tell everybody.
[02:28:56.798 --> 02:28:59.419]  About the local AM and FM stations you're listening to.
[02:28:59.439 --> 02:29:05.262]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:29:05.382 --> 02:29:07.422]  To prosecute wars takes a lot of money.
[02:29:19.787 --> 02:29:28.856]  And if you look at the communists, they'll rob banks, they'll sell children to sex slavery, they'll hold people ransom for money for the revolutions.
[02:29:30.477 --> 02:29:32.379]  But that's not how our founding fathers did it.
[02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:35.382]  They just robbed British gold shipments.
[02:29:37.159 --> 02:29:37.659]  Kill people.
[02:29:38.360 --> 02:29:39.821]  We're not doing any of that.
[02:29:40.281 --> 02:29:47.287]  We're just selling t-shirts and books and films and air filtration and non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[02:29:47.467 --> 02:29:50.849]  A general store of high quality products at great prices.
[02:29:51.990 --> 02:29:53.811]  And so, we have our new special.
[02:29:54.792 --> 02:29:57.214]  And it is the biggest special we've ever had.
[02:29:58.462 --> 02:30:00.943]  The last special we had was basically Christmas in July.
[02:30:01.583 --> 02:30:02.783]  It's the best specials we do.
[02:30:02.803 --> 02:30:05.343]  50% off, free shipping, stuff like that.
[02:30:06.104 --> 02:30:14.585]  This new special, if you take advantage of all the sales that are there, is 75% off more than 30 items.
[02:30:15.726 --> 02:30:17.206]  The average item is 50% off.
[02:30:18.206 --> 02:30:23.007]  So the sale runs the gambit, the gauntlet, from 75% off to 25% off.
[02:30:23.227 --> 02:30:25.388]  And there's a bunch of other specials too.
[02:30:26.228 --> 02:30:27.328]  A dozen items.
[02:30:29.048 --> 02:30:29.188]  Our 1776.
[02:30:30.069 --> 02:30:35.713]  Some of these items retail for $50 and we've never sold them for this price.
[02:30:36.574 --> 02:30:37.255]  But it's true.
[02:30:37.355 --> 02:30:39.236]  I've obituated the audience to pick sales.
[02:30:40.397 --> 02:30:41.778]  And the audience is smart.
[02:30:41.798 --> 02:30:47.863]  They know, wow, these are really good deals on the air filtration, the water filtration, the seeds, the supplements.
[02:30:48.543 --> 02:30:49.064]  Here's an example.
[02:30:50.484 --> 02:30:55.005]  Nobody ever put $15 plus into a turmeric formula.
[02:30:55.765 --> 02:31:02.727]  Our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula has at least $15 a product in it, not counting shipping and marketing, everything goes into the cost.
[02:31:03.488 --> 02:31:05.468]  The leading competitor puts $5 in the bottle.
[02:31:05.828 --> 02:31:10.549]  It's the strongest turmeric extract with all the other key co-enzymes.
[02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:13.270]  If you don't know about turmeric, you need to learn about it.
[02:31:13.290 --> 02:31:14.731]  If you don't know about Body's, you should find out about it.
[02:31:14.991 --> 02:31:16.211]  That's one product.
[02:31:19.991 --> 02:31:21.973]  Highest discount we've ever offered on it.
[02:31:21.993 --> 02:31:23.894]  75% off.
[02:31:25.836 --> 02:31:27.017]  It's just crazy.
[02:31:27.437 --> 02:31:30.059]  Infowarsstore.com is the main site.
[02:31:30.460 --> 02:31:33.642]  Infowarslife.com is the supplement area.
[02:31:33.662 --> 02:31:34.743]  It takes you right to that.
[02:31:35.204 --> 02:31:39.948]  And in celebration of the amazing victories we're having against tyranny, we're having the 1776
[02:31:41.849 --> 02:31:45.111]  Worldwide sale that we are just launching.
[02:31:45.912 --> 02:31:49.714]  And a lot of these products like X2 are on the verge of selling out, Brain Force and things.
[02:31:49.734 --> 02:31:59.220]  But whether it's Winter Sun or Icarin or Bio, PCA or Floralife or Gut Fusion, all shirts and hats, including the new Betsy Ross 1776.
[02:32:01.281 --> 02:32:03.323]  Are also discounted for $17.76.
[02:32:03.363 --> 02:32:07.126]  So everything is on sale.
[02:32:07.726 --> 02:32:08.047]  Okay?
[02:32:08.407 --> 02:32:11.870]  At Infowars4.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[02:32:11.950 --> 02:32:18.415]  And again, I can't tell you about all the initiatives we're involved in because when my name's on it, the enemy tries to shut it down.
[02:32:18.695 --> 02:32:19.636]  You already understand that.
[02:32:19.916 --> 02:32:24.100]  But what you see visibly at Infowars is the tip of the iceberg.
[02:32:25.282 --> 02:32:31.124]  There's a giant mountain under the water, and we are doing amazing things thanks to your support.
[02:32:31.384 --> 02:32:45.148]  There is nowhere on Earth where you can financially invest, get great products back, and know that you are fueling an explosive zeitgeist that has the globalists literally quaking in their filthy boots.

[02:33:02.077 --> 02:33:02.758]  Thank you for watching.
[02:33:06.282 --> 02:33:08.905]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:35.678 --> 02:33:38.000]  InfoWars has got a satellite feed.
[02:33:38.380 --> 02:33:40.101]  Yeah, we've got the full setup.
[02:33:42.103 --> 02:33:43.944]  Inside the Justice Department right now.
[02:33:44.284 --> 02:33:52.990]  To the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:53.671 --> 02:34:01.356]  And here comes the Trump administration official, Alexander Acosta.
[02:34:04.189 --> 02:34:06.350]  Department of Labor on the whole Epstein scandal.
[02:34:06.390 --> 02:34:06.830]  Here it is.
[02:34:11.871 --> 02:34:18.113]  Let me start by reiterating that I'm pleased that the New York prosecution is going forward.
[02:34:19.173 --> 02:34:24.854]  They brought these charges based on new evidence against Jeffrey Epstein, who is now a registered sex offender.
[02:34:25.735 --> 02:34:28.275]  And this is a very, very good thing.
[02:34:29.475 --> 02:34:30.836]  His acts are despicable.
[02:34:31.906 --> 02:34:39.493]  The New York prosecution offers an important opportunity to more fully bring Epstein to justice.
[02:34:41.215 --> 02:34:46.860]  In 2008, a major newspaper described the Epstein prosecution like this.
[02:34:48.581 --> 02:34:55.288]  A Florida grand jury, that is a grand jury convened by the district attorney of Palm Beach County,
[02:34:56.351 --> 02:34:58.632]  Had charged Epstein with a lesser offense.
[02:34:59.672 --> 02:35:02.473]  At that time, the Epstein legal team was elated.
[02:35:03.314 --> 02:35:05.995]  He would have avoided prison altogether.
[02:35:07.215 --> 02:35:10.296]  But then the United States Attorney's Office in Miami became involved.
[02:35:11.457 --> 02:35:12.597]  Epstein got an ultimatum.
[02:35:13.477 --> 02:35:17.539]  Plead guilty to a charge that would require jail time and registration.
[02:35:18.819 --> 02:35:20.660]  Or face federal charges.
[02:35:22.341 --> 02:35:23.141]  And that was the week
[02:35:24.465 --> 02:35:26.787]  More than 10 years ago that Epstein went to jail.
[02:35:27.888 --> 02:35:34.074]  Times have changed and coverage of this case has certainly changed since that article.
[02:35:35.555 --> 02:35:38.678]  Facts are important and facts are being overlooked.
[02:35:39.879 --> 02:35:42.462]  This matter started as a state matter.
[02:35:43.646 --> 02:35:48.128]  He was prosecuted initially by the State of Florida and not by the U.S.
[02:35:48.168 --> 02:35:48.949]  Attorney's Office.
[02:35:49.849 --> 02:35:59.614]  In 2006, a grand jury convened by the State Attorney, the District Attorney of Palm Beach County, reviewed the evidence and recommended a single charge.
[02:36:00.414 --> 02:36:05.237]  And that charge would have resulted in no jail time, no restitution to the victim.
[02:36:06.297 --> 02:36:11.560]  Further, the State Attorney's Office allowed Epstein to self-surrender
[02:36:13.942 --> 02:36:15.664]  and arraigned him the following morning.
[02:36:16.785 --> 02:36:22.751]  Simply put, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office was ready to let Epstein walk free.
[02:36:23.372 --> 02:36:24.133]  No jail time.
[02:36:24.553 --> 02:36:24.914]  Nothing.
[02:36:27.517 --> 02:36:31.701]  Prosecutors in my former office found this to be completely unacceptable.
[02:36:32.836 --> 02:36:33.857]  And they became involved.
[02:36:34.077 --> 02:36:35.518]  Our office became involved.
[02:36:36.319 --> 02:36:42.103]  Our prosecutors, as this 2008 article recounts, presented the ultimatum.
[02:36:42.864 --> 02:36:44.745]  Plead guilty to more serious charges.
[02:36:45.986 --> 02:36:49.689]  Charges that require jail time, registration, and restitution.
[02:36:50.509 --> 02:36:54.873]  Or we'd roll the dice and bring a federal indictment.
[02:36:56.141 --> 02:37:02.722]  Without the work of our prosecutors, Epstein would have gotten away with just that state charge.
[02:37:04.383 --> 02:37:10.064]  Now, many today question the terms of that ultimatum, what's called the non-prosecution agreement.
[02:37:11.304 --> 02:37:18.726]  A good prosecutor will tell you that these cases are complex, especially when they involve children, and even more so in 2006.
[02:37:20.851 --> 02:37:30.939]  I've shared with those in this room today, and will make available publicly, an affidavit filed by the career prosecutor in a civil matter related to the Epstein case.
[02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:33.962]  She talks about the challenges faced.
[02:37:35.123 --> 02:37:46.412]  She talks about the victims being scared and traumatized, refusing to testify, and how some victims actually exonerated Epstein.
[02:37:48.297 --> 02:37:51.640]  Most had significant concerns about their identities being revealed.
[02:37:52.741 --> 02:37:59.706]  The acts that they had faced were horrible, and they didn't want people to know about them.
[02:38:01.528 --> 02:38:08.754]  And she goes on to write that quote, after the fact, people alleged that Epstein would have been easily convicted.
[02:38:10.095 --> 02:38:14.899]  As the prosecutor who handled the investigation, she says in this affidavit,
[02:38:16.243 --> 02:38:20.144]  These contentions overlook the facts that existed at the time.
[02:38:21.585 --> 02:38:29.247]  Her description of these facts are corroborated by the FBI case agent, whose affidavit I've also shared today.
[02:38:31.168 --> 02:38:39.491]  Thousands of prosecutors around the nation, this week, are weighing guilty pleas versus trials.
[02:38:40.731 --> 02:38:42.552]  These cases, as I said, are hard.
[02:38:43.936 --> 02:38:48.761]  They require a prosecutor to ask whether a plea that guarantees jail time.
[02:38:48.881 --> 02:39:01.532]  Alright, let's fade this down for a moment because I had my great famous constitutional and defense lawyer and free speech lawyer Norm Pattis set up to talk about very big developments in the whole Sandy Hook anti-free speech move.
[02:39:02.293 --> 02:39:03.855]  By the deep state of the Democrats.
[02:39:04.295 --> 02:39:06.957]  But he's also worked in a lot of big cases and can speak to this.
[02:39:07.698 --> 02:39:08.779]  And so I'll get his take on it.
[02:39:09.419 --> 02:39:11.801]  Obviously, we'll come out the next time and get to some of the questions.
[02:39:11.841 --> 02:39:14.023]  It's going to be, Donald Trump orders you to cover this up.
[02:39:14.063 --> 02:39:17.046]  This was over a decade ago, nothing to do with Trump.
[02:39:17.546 --> 02:39:18.787]  It was a bipartisan deal.
[02:39:19.228 --> 02:39:21.450]  I think because it was so high powered, it did get covered up.
[02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:22.591]  You heard about the state.
[02:39:23.211 --> 02:39:24.472]  The Feds did something.
[02:39:25.032 --> 02:39:27.093]  I'm not defending Alexander Acosta.
[02:39:28.194 --> 02:39:29.434]  Epstein was U.S.
[02:39:29.495 --> 02:39:30.855]  intelligence, FBI.
[02:39:30.875 --> 02:39:32.316]  It ties into all of it, folks.
[02:39:32.636 --> 02:39:33.457]  And it's all coming out.
[02:39:33.517 --> 02:39:35.058]  But to make this guy the bad guy?
[02:39:35.538 --> 02:39:40.501]  To make this guy, who's separated by thousands of degrees, the bad guy?
[02:39:40.901 --> 02:39:41.961]  And to make Trump the thing?
[02:39:41.981 --> 02:39:43.242]  I'm not here to defend Trump.
[02:39:43.282 --> 02:39:44.443]  I get persecuted because of Trump.
[02:39:45.263 --> 02:39:46.986]  But there's nothing there.
[02:39:47.306 --> 02:39:51.872]  Schumer got thousands of donations from Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:39:52.252 --> 02:39:56.037]  His aide-de-camp, Wiener, was obviously a procurer for Epstein.
[02:39:56.057 --> 02:39:56.618]  That's come out.
[02:39:57.599 --> 02:40:01.063]  So, bringing in Norm Pattis, famous constitutional lawyer, one of the top guys in the country,
[02:40:01.604 --> 02:40:02.985]  What do you make of this train wreck?
[02:40:03.005 --> 02:40:04.646]  What do you think of what's unfolding here?
[02:40:04.666 --> 02:40:06.147]  I know you weren't coming on about this.
[02:40:06.168 --> 02:40:15.695]  You were coming on about your big one-in-a-million appeal being accepted to the Supreme Court, which even the Connecticut News says this is unheard of in my case.
[02:40:16.175 --> 02:40:18.397]  We'll talk about that next segment, but what do you make of what's happening here?
[02:40:19.525 --> 02:40:19.945]  I don't.
[02:40:20.005 --> 02:40:21.006]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:40:21.146 --> 02:40:25.247]  You know, the fact of the matter is that we're a nation of sexophrenics.
[02:40:25.347 --> 02:40:27.828]  We use sex to sell every product.
[02:40:27.948 --> 02:40:30.729]  When somebody colors outside the libidinal lines, we turn on them.
[02:40:31.249 --> 02:40:34.511]  Epstein, if the allegations are true, had an appetite for young women.
[02:40:34.691 --> 02:40:36.692]  He surfaced on prosecutorial radar.
[02:40:37.052 --> 02:40:37.752]  He cut a deal.
[02:40:38.452 --> 02:40:48.176]  The prosecution at that time weighed the risks and costs of going forward, including the cost to the young women of having to testify publicly, and cut a deal with Acosta.
[02:40:48.876 --> 02:40:49.477]  I don't know.
[02:41:03.885 --> 02:41:05.126]  No, I agree.
[02:41:05.286 --> 02:41:07.547]  So why isn't Bill Clinton doing a press conference?
[02:41:07.607 --> 02:41:09.408]  Or why aren't people on the airplane doing it?
[02:41:09.748 --> 02:41:11.529]  Why is it the former U.S.
[02:41:11.609 --> 02:41:16.852]  Attorney, when the Democrats came to him and said, we're going to know Bill this, and he said, well, at least give us something.
[02:41:16.892 --> 02:41:18.312]  Put him in jail for at least a year.
[02:41:18.633 --> 02:41:20.534]  How does it turn into he's the bad guy?
[02:41:20.614 --> 02:41:21.114]  I don't get that.
[02:41:22.506 --> 02:41:23.788]  Candidly, Alex, I don't either.
[02:41:24.248 --> 02:41:28.412]  And I'll be honest with you, the story is so unimpressive to me.
[02:41:28.432 --> 02:41:29.994]  I've not paid any attention to it at all.
[02:41:30.014 --> 02:41:34.118]  The first time I listened to it was listening to it, waiting on it to come on to talk about something else.
[02:41:34.639 --> 02:41:39.945]  I'm involved in plea bargains every day in cases, obviously, that are not often as significant as this.
[02:41:40.405 --> 02:41:41.867]  Plea bargaining is an ugly business.
[02:41:42.507 --> 02:41:42.788]  People
[02:41:43.608 --> 02:41:48.314]  They weigh the risks of going forward against the cost and take what they can get.
[02:41:48.514 --> 02:41:50.296]  It looked like justice 10 years ago.
[02:41:50.316 --> 02:41:51.457]  Today it's a holy war.
[02:41:51.577 --> 02:41:53.099]  I feel bad for Epstein, frankly.
[02:41:55.041 --> 02:41:57.684]  So you think he's been sucked into something larger?
[02:41:59.102 --> 02:42:01.784]  You know, I defend people.
[02:42:02.204 --> 02:42:02.824]  That's what I do.
[02:42:02.884 --> 02:42:04.065]  That's how I'm put together.
[02:42:04.085 --> 02:42:10.368]  I'm reading the papers and I'm thinking, you know, what do they know today that they didn't know then?
[02:42:11.669 --> 02:42:16.532]  I'm wondering whether there's a way to leverage the prior plea into a quieting of the waters.
[02:42:17.132 --> 02:42:21.477]  I don't want to be, you know, portrayed as somebody who's going out to defend sex offenders.
[02:42:21.617 --> 02:42:23.439]  I defend people against charges.
[02:42:23.939 --> 02:42:25.902]  You cut a deal with the government a decade ago.
[02:42:25.942 --> 02:42:27.523]  What makes this new news today?
[02:42:27.543 --> 02:42:28.564]  I'm not sure.
[02:42:28.584 --> 02:42:29.185]  Well, I'll tell you.
[02:42:29.245 --> 02:42:29.666]  I'll tell you.
[02:42:29.706 --> 02:42:30.186]  I'll tell you.
[02:42:30.607 --> 02:42:34.731]  The Democrats made up a bunch of Jane Does with Epstein.
[02:42:34.931 --> 02:42:36.232]  He didn't do it against Trump.
[02:42:36.693 --> 02:42:37.674]  So Trump's got to fight back.
[02:42:38.515 --> 02:42:39.316]  But I see what you're saying.
[02:42:40.595 --> 02:42:41.436]  That's probably true.
[02:42:41.456 --> 02:42:46.038]  Although, you know, when you politicize criminal justice, that's the most dangerous thing that you can do.
[02:42:46.479 --> 02:42:54.363]  Giving prosecutors unlimited discretion or, you know, to prosecute whensoever they choose for whatever reason they choose is the height of a due process violation.
[02:42:54.503 --> 02:42:55.584]  All right, I hear what you're saying.
[02:42:55.864 --> 02:42:58.246]  Let's shift gears into this big win, this big case.
[02:42:58.646 --> 02:42:59.827]  When we come back, stay with us.
[02:43:03.371 --> 02:43:05.854]  Pump, pageantry, and armored tanks.
[02:43:06.215 --> 02:43:09.959]  President Trump creates a different kind of fireworks this 4th of July.
[02:43:10.339 --> 02:43:15.706]  In recent years, 4th of July on the National Mall has been a tribute to universal American themes.
[02:43:16.066 --> 02:43:20.892]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, a star-spangled civic hymn.
[02:43:22.853 --> 02:43:25.535]  This year, by design, it will be much more about him.
[02:43:26.675 --> 02:43:27.096]  Confirmed.
[02:43:27.296 --> 02:43:31.878]  President Trump has decided that this year, the 4th of July, should be for him.
[02:43:31.899 --> 02:43:35.261]  It's a celebration of our nation's history.
[02:43:35.341 --> 02:43:38.923]  It's not a celebration of any particular individual, including
[02:43:39.463 --> 02:43:39.663]  Him.
[02:43:39.743 --> 02:43:40.663]  I don't think he understands.
[02:43:40.703 --> 02:43:42.724]  This is America's birthday, not his birthday.
[02:43:42.764 --> 02:43:44.425]  This is why the word hijacked is being used.
[02:43:44.445 --> 02:43:48.366]  Donald Trump has hijacked the nation's previously nonpartisan 4th of July celebration.
[02:43:48.486 --> 02:43:52.407]  That effort to hijack July 4th for his own purposes did not go well.
[02:43:52.607 --> 02:43:59.650]  Using patriotism and the military as political props has hijacked a day that should unify Americans.
[02:43:59.830 --> 02:44:03.911]  But it's safe to say unifying Americans is not one of Trump's core talents.
[02:44:03.951 --> 02:44:08.095]  I've decided Washington is going to have a party on the 4th of July.
[02:44:29.895 --> 02:44:35.563]  There will be big parades with floats using a new invention of mine.
[02:44:38.256 --> 02:44:40.598]  This should not be a political event.
[02:44:40.658 --> 02:44:44.220]  Nothing about 4th of July should be reduced to politics.
[02:44:44.340 --> 02:44:46.621]  But he's putting himself at the center of this.
[02:44:46.681 --> 02:44:51.224]  He is, by all accounts, the most polarizing president in modern history.
[02:44:51.325 --> 02:44:59.710]  And simply by his presence, standing in front of one of our most cherished monuments, makes this a very controversial decision.
[02:44:59.770 --> 02:45:00.731]  There's no need for this.
[02:45:00.891 --> 02:45:04.194]  I mean we've celebrated America on 4th of July pretty well.
[02:45:05.375 --> 02:45:14.123]  I think in part this is about a president who's deeply insecure and this is a bit of sort of phony toughness that we've seen out of him.
[02:45:14.143 --> 02:45:17.606]  Sure looks like a partisan re-election rally on public space.
[02:45:17.907 --> 02:45:23.352]  Donald Trump's campaign rally in Washington paid for by the American taxpayer.
[02:45:23.372 --> 02:45:24.453]  A campaign event.
[02:45:24.733 --> 02:45:26.094]  Some kind of a campaign speech.
[02:45:26.174 --> 02:45:27.054]  A political rally.
[02:45:27.154 --> 02:45:27.935]  Partisan event.
[02:45:28.015 --> 02:45:34.739]  Combination Trump rally and Kim Jong-un-style military parade.
[02:45:34.779 --> 02:45:40.942]  The president's vision bears a closer resemblance to the chest-thumping displays put on by authoritarian regimes.
[02:45:40.982 --> 02:45:45.605]  This is the kind of military display that we were used to seeing from the Soviet Union.
[02:45:45.625 --> 02:45:48.787]  I also have some concerns about a president
[02:45:49.827 --> 02:45:55.492]  Not celebrating the military, but glorifying military might.
[02:45:56.153 --> 02:45:57.594]  That scares me the most.
[02:45:57.614 --> 02:46:00.696]  I'm just troubled about the militaristic tone of this whole thing.
[02:46:00.717 --> 02:46:03.999]  This reminds me of parades I used to attend in the Soviet Union.
[02:46:04.380 --> 02:46:06.562]  Not the right look for the 4th.
[02:46:06.902 --> 02:46:12.326]  Americans love our freedom and no one will ever take it away from us.
[02:46:14.491 --> 02:46:21.415]  Those words sparking criticism that the president has taken over DC's 4th of July celebration on the National Mall.
[02:46:21.515 --> 02:46:23.997]  Because the American people are being co-opted into this.
[02:46:24.037 --> 02:46:24.858]  This is their day.
[02:46:24.918 --> 02:46:32.502]  This is the day for America and for every American and yet the American people are being somewhat against their will.
[02:46:32.622 --> 02:46:36.885]  Some of them who are just coming here for the fireworks co-opted to be a part of this.
[02:46:36.985 --> 02:46:39.507]  The nation's birthday is being politicized.
[02:46:39.867 --> 02:46:52.131]  Devotion to our founding ideals led American patriots to abolish the evil of slavery, secure civil rights, and expand the blessings of liberty to all Americans.
[02:47:06.215 --> 02:47:08.876]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:59.260 --> 02:48:05.822]  Your staff from my office met and they said, these are the four points that you will have to do in state court.
[02:48:06.762 --> 02:48:08.622]  And if not, we will proceed federally.
[02:48:11.863 --> 02:48:16.064]  They were very serious that they would proceed federally.
[02:48:16.144 --> 02:48:19.324]  That does not mean that they were confident in the final outcome.
[02:48:19.344 --> 02:48:26.326]  And one of the tough questions in these cases, what is the value of a secured guilty plea
[02:48:27.853 --> 02:48:30.415]  With registration versus rolling the dice.
[02:48:31.296 --> 02:48:36.520]  And I know that in 2019, looking back on 2008, things may look different.
[02:48:37.261 --> 02:48:40.283]  But this was the judgment of prosecutors.
[02:48:40.443 --> 02:48:44.847]  That's the 27th United States Secretary of Labor, Alexander Acosta.
[02:48:45.267 --> 02:48:47.989]  And we haven't gotten to the press conference part where they'll definitely try to blame Trump.
[02:48:48.770 --> 02:48:50.592]  You ask why is Epstein getting reindicted?
[02:48:51.843 --> 02:49:01.874]  Because Hillary and the Democrats kept trying to say Trump was involved in all this and tried to blame a bunch of people, and so lawsuits got filed to get the documents to show they weren't, and it's reopened it all.
[02:49:02.956 --> 02:49:04.417]  So that's where all this is going.
[02:49:04.918 --> 02:49:10.124]  Now getting back here, I'm going to host about 15 minutes to the next hour, then Mike Adams is going to take it over to the war rooms at 3 o'clock.
[02:49:11.547 --> 02:49:31.841]  We have developments so huge here today, that when I was talking to some of the top constitutional lawyers in the country, like Norm Pattis, like Mark Randazzo, like Robert Barnes, and many others, I had other lawyers calling me today that I had to call back, that I don't even know that are well-known, saying, well, we didn't believe it when we saw that Facebook had changed its terms of service.
[02:49:32.442 --> 02:49:33.823]  And believe me, that doesn't just happen.
[02:49:34.383 --> 02:49:36.825]  Terms of service is like the Holy Grail at a big tech company.
[02:49:37.585 --> 02:49:40.908]  To say that you can incite people to kill somebody?
[02:49:42.193 --> 02:49:45.395]  If they're labeled a dangerous person, which I've been labeled.
[02:49:46.616 --> 02:49:47.837]  Now they changed it.
[02:49:48.177 --> 02:49:48.497]  Update.
[02:49:48.577 --> 02:49:51.579]  Facebook deletes policy allowing violent threats against dangerous individuals.
[02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:53.841]  I could talk for 20 years about this.
[02:49:54.921 --> 02:49:55.422]  Just this.
[02:49:55.482 --> 02:49:57.183]  This is how insane it's gotten.
[02:49:57.963 --> 02:50:00.004]  But then we've got this other incredible development.
[02:50:00.024 --> 02:50:02.066]  I remember talking to Norm Pattis.
[02:50:03.396 --> 02:50:10.120]  You know, three or four weeks ago, when I did not threaten the lawyers on the other side of the Sandy Hook, I did not say they sent me the child porn.
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:14.202]  I said I was angry at them, but I said whoever did it, there's a big reward for who did it.
[02:50:14.802 --> 02:50:16.503]  Well, they went to the judge and said, I said it was them.
[02:50:17.104 --> 02:50:18.485]  The media said I said it was them.
[02:50:19.085 --> 02:50:23.647]  And the judge threw out my anti-SLAPP, which would have allowed me to throw it out right away.
[02:50:24.148 --> 02:50:29.211]  Well, even the Connecticut News, thecurrent.com says, unheard of, one in a million.
[02:50:30.611 --> 02:50:34.133]  They said they can't even find cases where this has really happened, especially in one like this.
[02:50:34.613 --> 02:50:38.955]  It's going to the Connecticut Supreme Court, not after the case, but before the case.
[02:50:39.375 --> 02:50:49.739]  And so Norm Pattis, congratulations on the fact that you told me, you said, listen, it's a political case, obviously, but the law is 100% clear and we just have to do this.
[02:50:49.819 --> 02:50:50.219]  Are you for it?
[02:50:50.239 --> 02:50:51.539]  And I said, hell, of course I am.
[02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:52.980]  This is a big deal.
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:54.040]  Very rare.
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:55.141]  Why don't you explain this to folks?
[02:50:56.752 --> 02:51:05.577]  Connecticut Supreme Court this morning, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, agreed to grant you, InfoWars and Alex Jones and related entities, the ability to take what's called a public interest appeal.
[02:51:06.237 --> 02:51:08.879]  Normally, when you take an appeal, it's after the case is over.
[02:51:08.919 --> 02:51:10.980]  That's the so-called final judgment rule.
[02:51:11.380 --> 02:51:15.382]  There are special cases where intermediate or interlocutory appeals can be taken.
[02:51:15.862 --> 02:51:24.387]  Connecticut has a statute that says when an issue arises that's so important that it's in the public interest that it be heard immediately, the Supreme Court can bend the rules and let the appeal go up.
[02:51:24.907 --> 02:51:35.776]  So we took a public interest appeal of Judge Bellis' rule denying your anti-slap motion in the face of the bogus claim that you had threatened Chris Maddy and lawyers for the other side.
[02:51:36.256 --> 02:51:38.018]  I was sitting right there on air with you.
[02:51:38.398 --> 02:51:39.119]  You did not.
[02:51:39.519 --> 02:51:45.704]  It was crystal clear and abundantly clear to me that this was not inciting violence or a true threat within the meaning of the law.
[02:51:46.204 --> 02:51:47.265]  We're good to go.
[02:52:08.997 --> 02:52:18.986]  Even though they knew you were in a three-year super famous case which you just won in the same courthouse and couldn't be there?
[02:52:20.015 --> 02:52:23.918]  Well, that's funny because when the argument began, we thought it was going to be a scheduling thing.
[02:52:24.538 --> 02:52:26.540]  And so I was on the sixth floor of a building.
[02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:29.362]  You and another lawyer from my office were on the fifth.
[02:52:29.542 --> 02:52:31.763]  He came up at the lunch break and said, you better get down there.
[02:52:32.664 --> 02:52:34.445]  I think the judge is going to throw the whole case.
[02:52:34.665 --> 02:52:35.906]  You've got to be out of your mind.
[02:52:35.946 --> 02:52:38.268]  She can't do that based on the law of the case.
[02:52:38.728 --> 02:52:39.429]  So I went down.
[02:52:39.509 --> 02:52:41.410]  We took a break from the other case I was in.
[02:52:41.930 --> 02:52:44.512]  And sure enough, she had her finger on the trigger.
[02:52:44.732 --> 02:52:48.355]  Now, we managed to persuade her from executing the entire case.
[02:52:49.095 --> 02:52:51.275]  But she still did you grievous damage.
[02:52:51.416 --> 02:53:02.978]  So we took an appeal basically saying, A, you didn't threaten anybody, and B, because you didn't, the idea that you're being sanctioned for the exercise of your free speech is offensive to the First Amendment.
[02:53:03.318 --> 02:53:05.838]  What's more, in the context of this case, it's doubly offensive.
[02:53:06.158 --> 02:53:09.419]  You've been trying for the better part of a year to get your motion to dismiss heard.
[02:53:10.139 --> 02:53:16.660]  The plaintiff's lawyers have engaged in any amount of gamesmanship to try to avoid being heard on the merits, and they have succeeded.
[02:53:17.300 --> 02:53:19.983]  So we've asked the courts, you know, to intervene.
[02:53:20.023 --> 02:53:22.365]  The Supreme Court set a briefing schedule.
[02:53:22.865 --> 02:53:24.407]  Our brief will be due in two weeks.
[02:53:24.487 --> 02:53:26.889]  The other side has to file theirs within a couple of weeks.
[02:53:26.929 --> 02:53:28.130]  We get a chance to reply.
[02:53:28.370 --> 02:53:36.378]  And the issues will be argued in front of the state Supreme Court sometime, I think, in late September to early October of this year, with a decision shortly thereafter.
[02:53:37.009 --> 02:53:40.931]  We will ask the court to order the trial court to hear your motion to dismiss.
[02:53:41.431 --> 02:53:47.194]  The anti-slap suit was a vehicle that was intended to protect First Amendment values.
[02:53:47.614 --> 02:53:58.559]  In this case, the First Amendment's been made a mockery of, and much like the Acosta thing, politics are driving the interpretation of the law, and we're ending up in a strange new world that I don't want to live in, and I don't think you do either.
[02:53:58.799 --> 02:53:59.920]  So I'm pretty excited about the
[02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:05.604]  Well, expanding on that, I got called by one of my family lawyers whose, you know, name is on, you know, a lot of the state laws and things here.
[02:54:05.624 --> 02:54:07.065]  He just said, well, congratulations.
[02:54:07.105 --> 02:54:09.487]  He said, I looked it up, that's incredibly rare.
[02:54:09.767 --> 02:54:10.468]  And I said, what do you mean?
[02:54:10.488 --> 02:54:21.196]  He goes, well, normally these type of appeals before a case really even starts are like when the judge or somebody else, we're not accusing the judge here of that, the judge literally gets caught being paid off in the parking lot.
[02:54:21.636 --> 02:54:22.958]  Or videotaped or whatever.
[02:54:23.780 --> 02:54:27.566]  They only come in with these public interests when it looks like a serious miscarriage.
[02:54:27.946 --> 02:54:30.370]  And even the Connecticut News says this is incredibly rare.
[02:54:30.390 --> 02:54:35.518]  This has got to have the other side creating diamonds inside their, you know, what's.
[02:54:36.810 --> 02:54:41.932]  Well, they're probably creating diamonds with whoever's funding this extremely costly boondoggle of litigation.
[02:54:42.232 --> 02:54:54.155]  You know, the most interesting thing, and your viewers may not, those at least who aren't in Connecticut probably don't have the insight, but you know, as I've come to represent you and been known around the state as your lawyer, at least in Connecticut, a number of people
[02:54:54.155 --> 02:54:56.776]  People are coming up to me saying, what's going on with these Sandy Hook cases?
[02:54:56.816 --> 02:54:58.577]  And people are beginning to think, you know what?
[02:54:58.837 --> 02:55:00.198]  That was then, this is now.
[02:55:00.558 --> 02:55:06.261]  Yes, it was a horrible shooting in 2012, and there were certainly questions about what happened, and you among others raised them.
[02:55:06.561 --> 02:55:08.342]  But that was then, this is now.
[02:55:08.822 --> 02:55:16.305]  In our pity for the families of Sandy Hook survivors, or victims rather, we ought not to go so far as to make them censored.
[02:55:16.385 --> 02:55:18.526]  And that's what this litigation is becoming about.
[02:55:18.566 --> 02:55:20.607]  It's becoming about self-righteous censorship.
[02:55:20.867 --> 02:55:21.728]  And I'm hoping
[02:55:22.148 --> 02:55:27.494]  That we'll get a full hearing before the Connecticut Supreme Court on these issues and I'm looking forward to hearing from the court.
[02:55:27.574 --> 02:55:28.455]  And Norm, let's be clear.
[02:55:28.495 --> 02:55:30.678]  We're not tooting our horn going, oh we're important.
[02:55:31.839 --> 02:55:38.006]  The Democrats, the Republicans, the courts admit this is the seminal, these cases are meant to end the First Amendment.
[02:55:38.366 --> 02:55:40.388]  And listen, I want to say nice things about Clarence Thomas.
[02:55:41.229 --> 02:55:48.917]  He wrote three months ago a huge op-ed in the New York Times saying it's time to end the First Amendment and get rid of press freedom because of Kavanaugh.
[02:55:49.137 --> 02:55:50.598]  No, it's terrible what they did to Kavanaugh.
[02:55:50.858 --> 02:55:53.221]  That's why we need good press to counter bad press.
[02:55:53.441 --> 02:55:55.803]  But they got Republicans ready to get rid of free speech, too.
[02:55:56.103 --> 02:56:03.631]  I found out big Republican money out of Texas connected to a former president or presidents are actually involved in this, my friend.
[02:56:04.687 --> 02:56:06.209]  Well, that's chilling to me.
[02:56:06.269 --> 02:56:07.991]  I mean, you know, I'm just a meat and potato lawyer.
[02:56:08.011 --> 02:56:09.953]  You swim in waters that are too deep for me.
[02:56:10.313 --> 02:56:16.259]  But from where I sit, if I don't like what somebody's saying, I can turn my ears off, so to speak, and walk across the street.
[02:56:16.620 --> 02:56:20.064]  I don't want the government or somebody else telling me what I can and can't listen.
[02:56:20.084 --> 02:56:22.026]  We can also get right back in their face with the truth.
[02:56:23.209 --> 02:56:23.770]  Absolutely.
[02:56:24.230 --> 02:56:25.071]  Absolutely.
[02:56:25.192 --> 02:56:32.140]  And the truth is, with respect to Sandy Hook, this is long since in the rearview mirror for you that people keeping it alive are doing so.
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:33.481]  I think for political reasons.
[02:56:33.501 --> 02:56:34.883]  Let me ask you this.
[02:56:35.083 --> 02:56:38.708]  Why do you think the court did this incredibly rare thing?
[02:56:40.553 --> 02:56:41.474]  Because I think you're right.
[02:56:41.494 --> 02:56:42.215]  I think we're right.
[02:56:42.235 --> 02:56:54.152]  At a minimum, you are required to adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard, and this kangaroo court style of justice was uncalled for, and frankly, unheard of.
[02:56:54.212 --> 02:56:55.895]  I've never seen anything like it in Connecticut.
[02:56:57.316 --> 02:57:06.140]  Hopefully, the court will reach the conclusion that your speech, although angry and a product of frustration, was no true threat at all, and that no sanctions were warranted.
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:20.206]  In an ideal world, the court will look at the record that we have assembled thus far and conclude that you're getting a railroad job, that you're being crucified politically and being denied a statutory remedy, that is, the right to have your motion to dismiss for political reasons.
[02:57:20.746 --> 02:57:22.847]  Yes, what happened in Sandy Hook was tragic.
[02:57:23.127 --> 02:57:28.070]  But perhaps the courts are plainly prepared to stay to the victims of the Sandy Hook shootings, pick up your bed and walk.
[02:57:28.770 --> 02:57:29.731]  It's time to move on.
[02:57:29.751 --> 02:57:31.051]  That was seven years ago.
[02:57:31.071 --> 02:57:31.852]  That was then.
[02:57:31.872 --> 02:57:32.712]  This is now.
[02:57:32.772 --> 02:57:33.232]  There's a whole world.
[02:57:33.252 --> 02:57:38.255]  Because as much as some people may hate Alex Jones, if I lose my due process, everybody else loses them.
[02:57:40.186 --> 02:57:44.169]  And you know, I'm worried in Connecticut, you're an unpopular figure amongst some.
[02:57:44.209 --> 02:57:47.611]  We've got a lot more support for you in recent weeks.
[02:57:47.671 --> 02:57:48.372]  Hold on, stay there.
[02:57:48.392 --> 02:57:49.072]  Back in two minutes.
[02:57:49.112 --> 02:57:50.613]  Norm Pattis, Fourth Hour, coming up.
[02:57:54.224 --> 02:58:01.948]  I want to tell you about the Betsy Ross 1776 Limited Edition shirt, which is now available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:02.128 --> 02:58:04.150]  This was a big controversy last week.
[02:58:04.210 --> 02:58:09.833]  How dare Nike even attempt to bring out a product with an American flag on it?
[02:58:10.133 --> 02:58:14.255]  The 13 star American flag, which is so racist and white supremacist.
[02:58:14.295 --> 02:58:17.357]  It was hung at Barack Obama's 2013 inauguration.
[02:58:17.397 --> 02:58:18.458]  That's how evil it is.
[02:58:18.578 --> 02:58:19.138]  Now we've got
[02:58:19.138 --> 02:58:23.241]  Well, we've got a T shirt to commemorate the butthurt that that caused last week.
[02:58:23.441 --> 02:58:31.267]  Unlike the politically correct cowards, we're bringing you an all new design featuring the pride and joy of revolutionary America, the Betsy Ross flag.
[02:58:31.387 --> 02:58:44.996]  It features two separate designs in two separate colors with only 1,000 of each design, so you can choose between the Since 1776 and the These Colors Don't Run taglines, and you can choose a blue or white background on the black.
[02:58:45.056 --> 02:58:48.639]  We've got the InfoWars.com logo as well as America's
[02:58:49.059 --> 02:58:49.819]  We're good to go.
[02:59:04.107 --> 02:59:05.528]  We're good to go.
[02:59:27.503 --> 02:59:27.843]  We're good to go!
[02:59:55.310 --> 02:59:59.413]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.933 --> 03:00:01.274]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:08.999 --> 03:00:09.379]  All right.
[03:00:10.620 --> 03:00:20.087]  One of Trump's top secretaries of labor, Alexander Acosta, is at a press conference because the whole media has made it about him and Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:00:20.107 --> 03:00:22.248]  It's not Bill Clinton on the airplanes.
[03:00:22.288 --> 03:00:23.129]  No, it's him.
[03:00:24.835 --> 03:00:25.716]  So okay, whatever.
[03:00:25.756 --> 03:00:29.778]  I don't know if he's guilty or not, but this is supposedly already adjudicated.
[03:00:29.838 --> 03:00:32.720]  It's all the new stuff that FT should be in trouble for and Bill Clinton.
[03:00:33.341 --> 03:00:37.123]  Coming up next segment, I'll play some of the questions that are ongoing live and Mike Adams takes over.
[03:00:37.143 --> 03:00:43.588]  But going back to famous constitutional civil rights and criminal defense lawyer here, Norm Pattis of Connecticut.
[03:00:45.429 --> 03:00:48.271]  Shifting gears out of our case, my case.
[03:00:49.460 --> 03:00:59.070]  What do you make, because I called you this morning, or you called me this morning, and then I called you back and I said, oh, by the way, have you seen where Facebook issues new policy saying it's acceptable to post death threats?
[03:00:59.130 --> 03:01:02.874]  And they say, well, if someone's been named as bad, you can organize their murder.
[03:01:03.374 --> 03:01:07.178]  Facebook then reversed it, it's on Infowars.com, with no comment.
[03:01:07.218 --> 03:01:08.720]  That's in their main terms of service.
[03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:10.482]  What do you think that means?
[03:01:12.141 --> 03:01:13.242]  It's absolutely chilling.
[03:01:13.342 --> 03:01:18.684]  First we've got a giant secret algorithm determining what we can and can't listen to or hear or see.
[03:01:19.104 --> 03:01:24.246]  Now we've got a giant algorithm determining who or what we can and should be encouraged to destroy.
[03:01:24.787 --> 03:01:27.268]  Facebook is behaving as the big other.
[03:01:28.128 --> 03:01:32.670]  And the notion that it can direct hatred toward others in the name of eliminating hatred
[03:01:33.190 --> 03:01:34.031]  It's unconscionable.
[03:01:34.171 --> 03:01:37.033]  It should be a neutral communications platform.
[03:01:37.133 --> 03:01:37.574]  It's not.
[03:01:37.954 --> 03:01:39.735]  We need to challenge it with litigation.
[03:01:39.795 --> 03:01:41.577]  We need to challenge it with legislation.
[03:01:41.817 --> 03:01:48.642]  Facebook is not in control of the country, or maybe it is, but I always thought we the people were the people who did the Constitution, not Facebook.
[03:01:49.790 --> 03:01:55.877]  Well that was beautifully said, because I've been struggling since I learned about this yesterday with Paul, to try to like, is it a fatwa?
[03:01:55.897 --> 03:01:57.298]  They're organizing people to kill us?
[03:01:58.460 --> 03:02:00.162]  They're demonizing us?
[03:02:00.662 --> 03:02:03.906]  They're convicting me outside of court and saying I deserve to die?
[03:02:03.946 --> 03:02:05.508]  I mean, this is so crazy!
[03:02:06.588 --> 03:02:09.911]  There is no mob as dangerous as a self-righteous mob.
[03:02:10.311 --> 03:02:23.502]  And when we give people the power to control speech, at least when it's governed by the First Amendment, it's supposed to be content-neutral to protect minorities, to protect people with unpopular views, to protect people outside the mainstream.
[03:02:23.882 --> 03:02:27.305]  Facebook, as a private company, lives a privileged life.
[03:02:27.405 --> 03:02:31.248]  It can't be sued for the content it hosts under the Communications Decency Act.
[03:02:31.509 --> 03:02:35.352]  But now, apparently, the communications it hosts are somewhat criminal in content.
[03:02:36.652 --> 03:02:43.514]  I totally agree, because I'm not a lawyer, but here it is, Section 230, they get immunity.
[03:02:43.954 --> 03:02:49.056]  They're now making judgments saying, you can only talk about Alex Jones if it's negative, and you can say kill him.
[03:02:49.336 --> 03:02:52.917]  They're not just being neutral, they're being positive.
[03:02:52.957 --> 03:02:53.337]  They're directing.
[03:02:55.259 --> 03:02:56.540]  It's an outrage.
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:01.623]  I've been away, out of the office, trying to avoid the law for a few weeks.
[03:03:01.663 --> 03:03:04.224]  Hearing about this from you this morning was the first I heard about it.
[03:03:04.704 --> 03:03:05.525]  I need to look into it.
[03:03:05.625 --> 03:03:12.509]  If you're right, and they made affirmative statements encouraging or enticing others to cause you harm, they should be prosecuted criminally.
[03:03:12.769 --> 03:03:13.089]  Period.
[03:03:13.129 --> 03:03:14.430]  That's what the criminal law is for.
[03:03:14.810 --> 03:03:20.153]  We are free to speak freely about one another and to detest one another for our ideas and the positions we take.
[03:03:20.553 --> 03:03:22.974]  We are not free to solicit the murder of others.
[03:03:23.554 --> 03:03:27.415]  We are not free to solicit gratuitous and random acts of violence based on politics.
[03:03:27.895 --> 03:03:34.297]  To declare that a hated source of speech can be hated to the point of physical violence is to make a mockery of the rule of law.
[03:03:34.737 --> 03:03:38.298]  Facebook is behaving like a behemoth that needs to be destroyed.
[03:03:39.622 --> 03:03:40.163]  Absolutely.
[03:03:40.183 --> 03:03:42.525]  If I was Facebook, I'd say destroy me.
[03:03:43.547 --> 03:03:44.247]  That's the key point.
[03:03:44.468 --> 03:03:47.912]  They're always saying we want violence, we want to end speech, we're oppressing people.
[03:03:48.152 --> 03:03:49.493]  I'm a classical liberal like you are.
[03:03:49.814 --> 03:03:52.437]  And then they're the ones doing everything they say we're doing.
[03:03:53.519 --> 03:03:56.181]  There's a lot of normalization of craziness going on.
[03:03:56.221 --> 03:04:01.685]  I'm watching the Democratic candidates and they're all trying to normalize us to reparations.
[03:04:02.305 --> 03:04:06.548]  Kamala Harris is saying we need to give housing allowances to people of color.
[03:04:07.108 --> 03:04:07.909]  What's that all about?
[03:04:07.929 --> 03:04:09.550]  I'm not going to pay a race-based tax.
[03:04:09.930 --> 03:04:12.572]  I'm not going to be penalized for my speech.
[03:04:12.592 --> 03:04:17.135]  The government is supposed to be a neutral regulator of competing values and competing interests.
[03:04:17.575 --> 03:04:21.580]  When it embraces one to the exclusion of the rights of others, it becomes tyrannical.
[03:04:21.980 --> 03:04:25.224]  And that's where lawyers play a role in going into courts and fighting for justice.
[03:04:25.624 --> 03:04:27.967]  Whether you get justice or not, that's an open question.
[03:04:28.067 --> 03:04:30.950]  You know, Clarence Darrow once said, there is no justice in or out of court.
[03:04:31.351 --> 03:04:32.011]  I think he's right.
[03:04:32.412 --> 03:04:33.673]  I think the fight is all there is.
[03:04:33.833 --> 03:04:35.816]  And the fight, unfortunately, is all we have left.
[03:04:36.156 --> 03:04:37.718]  That's why I'm so proud to represent you.
[03:04:38.258 --> 03:04:40.279]  I mean, you're out there every day pitching your fight.
[03:04:40.599 --> 03:04:41.980]  Your viewers are supporting you.
[03:04:42.440 --> 03:04:47.683]  I'm privileged enough to represent you, and I'll defend your right to speak and your listeners' right to hear you.
[03:04:48.063 --> 03:04:50.764]  But, you know, these are real fights, and they go on every day.
[03:04:50.784 --> 03:04:55.647]  And when you see this crap with Facebook, it makes you realize they may have potential life-and-death consequences.
[03:04:55.667 --> 03:04:56.147]  That's right.
[03:04:56.167 --> 03:04:57.568]  It just shows you things are out of control.
[03:04:57.608 --> 03:04:58.848]  Norm Pettis, thank you so much.
[03:04:58.888 --> 03:04:59.368]  God bless.
[03:04:59.549 --> 03:05:00.309]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:00.329 --> 03:05:00.789]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.809 --> 03:05:04.171]  1776 worldwide.
[03:05:07.881 --> 03:05:10.163]  That's a term I coined 15 years ago.
[03:05:11.023 --> 03:05:11.704]  What does it really mean?
[03:05:11.764 --> 03:05:16.347]  It means the idea of American freedom renaissance worldwide.
[03:05:16.367 --> 03:05:17.909]  It doesn't mean we go conquer countries.
[03:05:18.269 --> 03:05:26.395]  It means our superior Western values of true freedom get adopted because compared to globalism, it's night and day.
[03:05:27.175 --> 03:05:30.238]  We're going to do a 34-hour special broadcast
[03:05:31.192 --> 03:05:33.753]  That kicks off this Thursday morning at a.m.
[03:05:33.773 --> 03:05:34.393]  with David Knight.
[03:05:34.773 --> 03:05:39.335]  Runs right through with me and many others till the next day at 6 p.m.
[03:05:39.375 --> 03:05:39.895]  on The War Room.
[03:05:40.456 --> 03:05:45.558]  We're gonna have our crew in DC at the White House Summit on social media.
[03:05:45.578 --> 03:05:50.419]  We're gonna be at the after party with all the key folks taking action against censorship and so much more.
[03:05:50.780 --> 03:05:52.240]  So everybody, share that link.
[03:05:52.560 --> 03:05:55.882]  Infowars.com forward slash show kicking off this Thursday at
[03:05:57.302 --> 03:05:59.003]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:05:59.083 --> 03:06:01.104]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:21.540 --> 03:06:21.920]  U.S.
[03:06:21.980 --> 03:06:23.320]  News & World Report.
[03:06:23.680 --> 03:06:26.801]  Court to review sanctions against InfoWars host Alex Jones.
[03:06:27.341 --> 03:06:34.502]  Connecticut Supreme Court has agreed to consider whether a judge properly sanctioned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for remarks he made about a lawyer.
[03:06:34.683 --> 03:06:35.923]  But I didn't make it about the lawyer.
[03:06:36.543 --> 03:06:42.124]  For the families of the children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, Associated Press.
[03:06:43.564 --> 03:06:44.424]  Boy, they don't like that.
[03:06:44.584 --> 03:06:47.405]  Super rare to have an appeal before a case starts.
[03:06:49.508 --> 03:06:52.710]  They are really panicking because that judge went way too far.
[03:06:53.871 --> 03:06:56.832]  I just learned that someone had planted child porn in our emails.
[03:06:57.713 --> 03:06:58.654]  Hidden codes!
[03:06:59.994 --> 03:07:02.836]  And then they'd subpoenaed them and they were going to put it in the news.
[03:07:03.376 --> 03:07:07.239]  And I blew up at them and said, not the lawyers, but I said, whoever did this, there's a reward.
[03:07:07.279 --> 03:07:09.500]  I'm going to get your ass, put your head on a pipe.
[03:07:11.181 --> 03:07:13.222]  And then they turned it into that I was threatening the lawyers.
[03:07:13.302 --> 03:07:13.482]  What?
[03:07:16.044 --> 03:07:16.804]  Incredible, man.
[03:07:17.025 --> 03:07:17.525]  Incredible.
[03:07:19.605 --> 03:07:21.528]  Mike Adams is taking over very, very soon.
[03:07:22.950 --> 03:07:25.033]  Tommy Robinson's probably already gone to bed by now.
[03:07:26.215 --> 03:07:27.758]  He's got three young children and a great wife.
[03:07:29.180 --> 03:07:30.101]  I know him behind the scenes.
[03:07:31.527 --> 03:07:33.409]  He's facing two or three years in solitary confinement.
[03:07:33.449 --> 03:07:35.672]  No judge in America would ever do this.
[03:07:36.152 --> 03:07:42.079]  No jury would do this, but they've gotten rid of juries for people like Tommy, outside of law, without a jury trial.
[03:07:42.119 --> 03:07:42.860]  He's facing prison.
[03:07:43.521 --> 03:07:44.342]  That's just insane.
[03:07:45.123 --> 03:07:49.568]  But I thank Matt Drudge, the public, and everybody that spread those articles, and hopefully the president will consider
[03:07:51.687 --> 03:07:57.451]  Some type of diplomatic solution because we bring people here from Cuba or North Korea or China who are being persecuted for their speech.
[03:07:57.511 --> 03:07:57.951]  Journalists.
[03:07:58.632 --> 03:08:00.013]  That's a real asylum seeker.
[03:08:00.733 --> 03:08:02.534]  Not people here with an anchor baby or whatever.
[03:08:06.837 --> 03:08:11.640]  This is a hero that exposed giant child kidnapping rings that are all confirmed.
[03:08:12.461 --> 03:08:13.221]  Hundreds of trials.
[03:08:13.341 --> 03:08:15.243]  Thousands, thousands of convictions.
[03:08:15.463 --> 03:08:15.903]  He did it.
[03:08:16.844 --> 03:08:17.984]  He was domino number one.
[03:08:18.305 --> 03:08:20.186]  So to be carried on the people's shoulders
[03:08:23.643 --> 03:08:25.624]  Yeah, I talked to Tommy before I went on Tucker Carlson.
[03:08:26.865 --> 03:08:27.826]  He'd been out of jail two days.
[03:08:28.767 --> 03:08:29.787]  He lost almost 40 pounds.
[03:08:29.807 --> 03:08:30.488]  He's not a big guy.
[03:08:30.508 --> 03:08:36.072]  He'd been in jail a year before for trying to take kids away from child kidnappers.
[03:08:36.112 --> 03:08:36.913]  You just saw it going on.
[03:08:36.933 --> 03:08:37.873]  Little kids crying for mommy.
[03:08:38.133 --> 03:08:39.094]  Muzzles putting them in cars.
[03:08:39.114 --> 03:08:39.775]  He beat their ass.
[03:08:40.055 --> 03:08:41.536]  You've seen all the footage of him fighting people.
[03:08:42.236 --> 03:08:42.977]  This is going on everywhere.
[03:08:44.861 --> 03:08:46.482]  And he was completely out of it when I talked to him.
[03:08:47.243 --> 03:08:48.083]  Imagine the U.S.
[03:08:48.143 --> 03:08:52.386]  troops that have been like North Korea and North Vietnam for five years in solitary confinement.
[03:08:52.406 --> 03:08:53.287]  They're like, I don't know who they are.
[03:08:53.307 --> 03:08:54.868]  Well, he'd been there three months.
[03:08:55.989 --> 03:08:57.470]  Lost almost 40 pounds, no food.
[03:08:58.370 --> 03:09:02.193]  The muzzles putting their butts up to the opening, just all day, just pooping on him.
[03:09:02.813 --> 03:09:04.314]  The guards laughing, the liberal guards.
[03:09:04.875 --> 03:09:05.695]  He was just out of it.
[03:09:05.715 --> 03:09:08.197]  He was just like, I don't know if I can come on, Alex.
[03:09:08.657 --> 03:09:09.378]  He went on Tucker.
[03:09:09.398 --> 03:09:10.939]  Remember, he was like all spaced out on Tucker.
[03:09:11.755 --> 03:09:13.116]  He's a smart, well-spoken guy.
[03:09:13.396 --> 03:09:15.156]  But that's what that does to your spirit.
[03:09:16.577 --> 03:09:18.558]  Being a Muslim toilet in the UK.
[03:09:18.578 --> 03:09:24.380]  See, that was all a ritual to take a patriot like him and turn him into a toilet.
[03:09:25.421 --> 03:09:26.381]  Try to break his spirit.
[03:09:27.042 --> 03:09:29.122]  And now they want to shove him right back in the oven again.
[03:09:29.182 --> 03:09:30.143]  It pisses me off.
[03:09:30.463 --> 03:09:32.584]  I physically feel it like I'm being attacked.
[03:09:33.064 --> 03:09:33.624]  Because I am.
[03:09:34.845 --> 03:09:36.406]  They want to do that to me.
[03:09:36.426 --> 03:09:38.346]  They want to do that to you.
[03:09:38.366 --> 03:09:39.547]  I'm going to tell them something right now.
[03:09:40.939 --> 03:09:44.944]  Just like Facebook went so far as to say, we're going to tell people to kill conservatives.
[03:09:45.485 --> 03:09:47.026]  They said, you're allowed to kill conservatives.
[03:09:48.228 --> 03:09:50.370]  And they had to pull it, because we exposed it.
[03:09:50.410 --> 03:09:51.332]  But they're testing.
[03:09:51.732 --> 03:09:52.293]  They're probing.
[03:09:52.633 --> 03:09:56.458]  Here's some of Alexander Acosta's ongoing press conference.
[03:09:56.478 --> 03:09:57.119]  Let's see what's happening.
[03:10:00.126 --> 03:10:01.788]  Yes, Ben Penn from Bloomberg Law.
[03:10:02.028 --> 03:10:14.080]  In light of the attention this week on your handling of, back in 2008, victims of sex trafficking, I wanted to ask about your role today as Secretary of Labor.
[03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:16.423]  You have oversight through the Wage and Hour Division.
[03:10:17.023 --> 03:10:18.184]  So, let's hit the show.
[03:10:43.075 --> 03:10:44.916]  This is exactly where I thought it was going.
[03:10:45.637 --> 03:10:51.360]  We're being hit with a six-fold increase in illegal aliens coming across.
[03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:53.682]  One-third of the children aren't with their family.
[03:10:53.722 --> 03:10:54.562]  They genetically test them.
[03:10:55.623 --> 03:10:56.503]  We're collapsing.
[03:10:57.644 --> 03:11:03.668]  And then, they're like, oh, you're not giving enough services and certification to sex slaves.
[03:11:04.591 --> 03:11:21.194]  When it's the Border Patrol that's doing it, and trying to find out who's who, and the media says, don't stop them, don't check them, don't question, and the Senate report admits that Trump's policy is saving all these people, and it was Obama saying, let them through, even when they were being given to sex traffickers.
[03:11:21.514 --> 03:11:26.716]  I mean, the first question is, oh, you're connected to Epstein.
[03:11:27.016 --> 03:11:28.316]  You only sent him to jail for a year.
[03:11:29.289 --> 03:11:31.931]  So, you're involved in what we're doing as Democrats.
[03:11:32.031 --> 03:11:33.832]  I mean, these people are sick.
[03:11:34.712 --> 03:11:41.996]  And Google and Facebook are busy protecting the Clintons, protecting Democrats, and expunging their names out of Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[03:11:42.317 --> 03:11:52.202]  And then the Secretary of Labor, I don't know if he's guilty or innocent, but they're just immediately saying he is going to hurt children that are being brought in here illegally.
[03:11:52.242 --> 03:11:52.983]  Let's go back to it.
[03:11:56.830 --> 03:11:57.752]  That is not what it does.
[03:11:58.273 --> 03:12:03.282]  Our wage and hour administrator, after she was confirmed, came in and she reviewed the policies.
[03:12:04.338 --> 03:12:15.763]  And she put in place a requirement that a criminal prosecutor be consulted any time one of these issues is brought to the division's attention.
[03:12:16.023 --> 03:12:17.223]  And that seems very reasonable.
[03:12:17.503 --> 03:12:21.245]  Don't we want criminal prosecutors to be consulted?
[03:12:21.425 --> 03:12:22.926]  Oh, I forgot this part too.
[03:12:23.826 --> 03:12:28.588]  Trump changed the policy where criminal prosecutors have to look at people caught smuggling kids.
[03:12:32.006 --> 03:12:37.029]  Criminal prosecutors look at people caught with kids that aren't theirs coming across the border.
[03:12:39.550 --> 03:12:39.870]  Again.
[03:12:45.033 --> 03:12:48.895]  If Trump was involved in trafficking kids, I would wage war on him.
[03:12:49.235 --> 03:12:49.675]  He's not.
[03:12:50.355 --> 03:12:51.316]  It's the Clintons.
[03:12:51.736 --> 03:12:52.536]  It's Obama.
[03:12:52.877 --> 03:12:53.977]  It's all their people.
[03:12:54.918 --> 03:12:55.878]  And we know that.
[03:12:56.118 --> 03:12:57.179]  And then Trump sits there.
[03:13:00.154 --> 03:13:10.947]  And lets all the censorship go on and Facebook come out and say it's going to start letting users create groups to kill me and kill you.
[03:13:13.234 --> 03:13:14.755]  But see, Trump's 73.
[03:13:15.035 --> 03:13:16.296]  He's from when the country was freer.
[03:13:16.576 --> 03:13:17.957]  They just don't even know what's going on.
[03:13:18.237 --> 03:13:20.739]  And I know folks that are having dinner with Brad Parscale three times.
[03:13:21.019 --> 03:13:21.960]  People are having dinner with Trump.
[03:13:22.400 --> 03:13:24.962]  And Trump literally asked, well, how do they shadow ban?
[03:13:25.022 --> 03:13:25.742]  How does that work?
[03:13:26.123 --> 03:13:30.185]  I've talked to 10 people in the last week that have had dinner or meetings with Trump.
[03:13:30.465 --> 03:13:32.047]  And they say, no, he seems real nice.
[03:13:32.747 --> 03:13:35.609]  But he's like, yeah, they're lying about me on North Korea.
[03:13:35.689 --> 03:13:36.309]  I want peace.
[03:13:36.710 --> 03:13:39.171]  Or boy, he means well.
[03:13:39.231 --> 03:13:42.754]  But man, he has no idea how much evil he's up against.
[03:13:43.840 --> 03:13:44.701]  He just has no idea.
[03:13:45.221 --> 03:13:45.882]  And I get it.
[03:13:48.423 --> 03:13:49.624]  I can't believe how evil it is.
[03:13:49.904 --> 03:13:51.145]  I don't even know how you deal with it.
[03:13:51.165 --> 03:13:51.906]  So, do you hear this?
[03:13:52.166 --> 03:13:52.986]  Bloomberg here!
[03:13:54.007 --> 03:13:57.890]  You've got federal prosecutors talking to people caught smuggling kids across.
[03:13:57.930 --> 03:13:59.491]  What do you say for yourself, Acosta?
[03:14:00.151 --> 03:14:00.852]  Let's go back to it.
[03:14:03.808 --> 03:14:05.689]  And that seems very reasonable.
[03:14:05.989 --> 03:14:11.752]  Don't we want criminal prosecutors to be consulted whenever someone says that they are a victim of trafficking?
[03:14:11.972 --> 03:14:13.313]  No, that's evil.
[03:14:13.773 --> 03:14:16.814]  And that prosecutor will be consulted.
[03:14:17.194 --> 03:14:24.118]  And even if that prosecutor says this is not a case that we are going forward with... I'm sorry, hit pause again.
[03:14:24.518 --> 03:14:26.479]  There's sometimes one question that's a Rosetta Stone.
[03:14:26.499 --> 03:14:28.339]  This is the first question that was asked like 20 minutes ago.
[03:14:28.740 --> 03:14:29.240]  We paused it.
[03:14:30.307 --> 03:14:39.730]  How dare you get your agency out of the involvement, because Obama had it where there was no law enforcement involved, and they just let everybody in, and now you have people being arrested.
[03:14:39.930 --> 03:14:42.411]  How dare you hurt the children by arresting the pedophiles?
[03:14:42.891 --> 03:14:44.932]  I mean, you just can't.
[03:14:44.972 --> 03:14:45.632]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:14:46.292 --> 03:14:47.053]  It's insane.
[03:14:47.073 --> 03:14:48.113]  It's insane.
[03:14:48.133 --> 03:14:50.354]  They're in concentration camps.
[03:14:50.374 --> 03:14:50.954]  They're in cages.
[03:14:51.194 --> 03:14:51.374]  What?
[03:14:51.394 --> 03:14:53.435]  They're trying to get in here by the hundreds of thousands.
[03:14:53.675 --> 03:14:55.876]  We have no God knows who they are.
[03:14:57.116 --> 03:14:58.717]  Masses of them are kidnapped children!
[03:14:59.137 --> 03:15:00.878]  Trump tries to find out who they are!
[03:15:01.579 --> 03:15:02.799]  And now this guy.
[03:15:02.819 --> 03:15:04.460]  He's the bad man.
[03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:05.481]  Here, let's continue.
[03:15:07.722 --> 03:15:08.803]  He's on the facts.
[03:15:09.163 --> 03:15:13.886]  So that is a mischaracterization of her decision and her policy.
[03:15:14.765 --> 03:15:15.685]  Yes.
[03:15:15.725 --> 03:15:22.207]  Could you go into a bit more detail about where and how you exactly negotiated this deal?
[03:15:22.287 --> 03:15:25.788]  Did you meet with Epstein's attorney alone at a Marriott hotel?
[03:15:26.348 --> 03:15:28.628]  So, you know, I've read this... Let's hit pause again.
[03:15:28.648 --> 03:15:29.689]  We're going to come back with this.
[03:15:30.269 --> 03:15:30.669]  Back it up.
[03:15:31.269 --> 03:15:36.470]  So remember, Bill Clinton's on the plane now, it's like a hundred times, and there's little kids on there.
[03:15:36.750 --> 03:15:38.051]  This guy has nothing to do with it.
[03:15:38.091 --> 03:15:39.251]  The Democrats are going to let him off.
[03:15:39.291 --> 03:15:40.351]  They get some prosecution.
[03:15:40.371 --> 03:15:41.111]  I'm not even defending it.
[03:15:41.531 --> 03:15:42.592]  The guy deserved death penalty.
[03:15:43.272 --> 03:15:43.692]  And now...
[03:15:44.881 --> 03:15:45.561]  It's another reporter.
[03:15:46.022 --> 03:15:49.684]  Tell us about how you protected him for Trump 10 years ago, or 12 years ago.
[03:15:50.905 --> 03:15:53.827]  Again, all the media protecting the pedophiles.
[03:15:54.227 --> 03:15:55.328]  Google blocking it.
[03:15:55.988 --> 03:15:57.229]  Wikipedia blocking it.
[03:15:57.309 --> 03:15:59.731]  What a sick group of scum.
[03:16:02.705 --> 03:16:10.933]  Those people who are online making fun of members of Congress are a disgrace.
[03:16:11.774 --> 03:16:16.758]  And there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable.
[03:16:17.018 --> 03:16:18.520]  We're going to shut them down.
[03:16:19.040 --> 03:16:22.881]  And work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted.
[03:16:22.901 --> 03:16:27.862]  These women were being told by CBP officers to drink out of the toilet.
[03:16:28.302 --> 03:16:29.183]  Uh, excuse me.
[03:16:29.203 --> 03:16:31.503]  I think this might be Gatorade or something.
[03:16:31.523 --> 03:16:33.324]  I was just looking for some regular water.
[03:16:34.104 --> 03:16:34.464]  Water?
[03:16:34.704 --> 03:16:34.904]  Yeah.
[03:16:35.324 --> 03:16:36.244]  You mean like in the toilet?
[03:16:36.704 --> 03:16:41.866]  One of the women said that she was told by an agent to drink water out of the toilet.
[03:16:41.886 --> 03:16:43.266]  What for?
[03:16:52.985 --> 03:16:58.634]  What you're saying is that you want us to put water on the crops.
[03:16:58.874 --> 03:16:59.195]  Yes.
[03:16:59.676 --> 03:17:00.036]  Water.
[03:17:00.817 --> 03:17:01.638]  Like out the toilet?
[03:17:02.018 --> 03:17:05.521]  Well, I mean, it doesn't have to be out of the toilet, but yeah, that's the idea.
[03:17:05.541 --> 03:17:06.522]  Out of the toilet.
[03:17:06.762 --> 03:17:07.502]  Out of the toilet.
[03:17:07.522 --> 03:17:15.368]  Do you think that we should be using more Brondo on the crops in Africa to help alleviate the food shortage and the droughts over there?
[03:17:15.629 --> 03:17:15.889]  Yes.
[03:17:16.549 --> 03:17:21.673]  Any other comments on the Brondo being used in Africa that's helping the crops?
[03:17:21.773 --> 03:17:27.798]  Definitely, if they got it over there, they should get more out there to help them out and get the resources they need to stay healthy and alive.
[03:17:28.078 --> 03:17:28.778]  More Brondo.
[03:17:29.478 --> 03:17:31.879]  It's got electrolytes and what plants need.
[03:17:32.219 --> 03:17:37.181]  For the last time, I'm pretty sure what's killing the crops is this Brondo stuff.
[03:17:37.561 --> 03:17:39.201]  But Brondo's got what plants crave.
[03:17:39.241 --> 03:17:40.242]  It's got electrolytes.
[03:17:40.302 --> 03:17:44.263]  Now, I'm no botanist, but I do know that if you put water on plants, they grow.
[03:17:44.523 --> 03:17:47.684]  Oh, well, I've never seen no plants grow out of no toilet.
[03:17:47.764 --> 03:17:48.564]  Out of the toilet.
[03:17:48.804 --> 03:17:49.545]  Out of the toilet.
[03:17:49.585 --> 03:17:50.285]  Hey, that's good.
[03:17:50.545 --> 03:17:52.025]  You sure you ain't the smartest guy in the world?
[03:17:52.045 --> 03:17:52.125]  Yeah.
[03:17:54.381 --> 03:17:55.023]  Out of the toilet.
[03:18:03.883 --> 03:18:08.326]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:18:08.567 --> 03:18:13.250]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:18:13.871 --> 03:18:19.715]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[03:18:20.115 --> 03:18:32.725]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:18:33.485 --> 03:18:42.148]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:18:42.168 --> 03:18:44.069]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:45.549]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:18:45.569 --> 03:18:46.809]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:18:47.010 --> 03:18:48.190]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:18:48.410 --> 03:18:49.871]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:18:50.391 --> 03:18:52.012]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:18:52.032 --> 03:18:53.813]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:18:54.154 --> 03:18:56.775]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:18:56.815 --> 03:18:57.656]  This is insane.
[03:18:58.076 --> 03:18:59.697]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:18:59.957 --> 03:19:02.499]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:19:02.959 --> 03:19:04.480]  He says, this is totally free.
[03:19:04.520 --> 03:19:06.341]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:19:06.361 --> 03:19:08.222]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[03:19:09.083 --> 03:19:15.007]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[03:19:15.267 --> 03:19:16.608]  All just moderate dose.
[03:19:18.114 --> 03:19:26.121]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us a Mother Nature, is incredible.
[03:19:26.141 --> 03:19:28.303]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:28.324 --> 03:19:29.705]  But thank you for committing.
[03:19:33.766 --> 03:19:36.607]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[03:19:36.967 --> 03:19:39.588]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[03:19:39.608 --> 03:19:44.349]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[03:19:44.829 --> 03:19:50.951]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[03:19:50.991 --> 03:19:54.091]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[03:19:54.432 --> 03:19:55.752]  It's called reap what you show.
[03:20:06.713 --> 03:20:11.117]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.122 --> 03:20:20.005]  Yeah, here's our new single record from Highwayman 2 album.
[03:20:20.045 --> 03:20:20.846]  Silver Stallion.
[03:20:21.467 --> 03:20:22.348]  Silver Stallion.
[03:20:22.388 --> 03:20:24.870]  Mike Adams of nationalnews.com is loaded for bear.
[03:20:25.611 --> 03:20:26.812]  He's taking over here.
[03:20:26.832 --> 03:20:27.552]  Next segment.
[03:20:34.031 --> 03:20:38.215]  So I've been reading about Alexander Acosta for, I don't know, four or five years since Trump ran.
[03:20:38.235 --> 03:20:43.999]  Because Trump had him involved in the campaign and then he put him in as head of the Department of Labor.
[03:20:45.621 --> 03:20:47.842]  And I'm neutral, so I'm just watching, I'm looking.
[03:20:48.623 --> 03:20:55.188]  And then it's like, how dare the Border Patrol and Justice Department have prosecutors under your recommendation stopping child trafficking?
[03:20:55.228 --> 03:20:56.229]  You pedophile.
[03:20:56.249 --> 03:20:59.231]  I mean, this is crazy town.
[03:21:00.143 --> 03:21:01.344]  And the next person jumps up.
[03:21:01.364 --> 03:21:03.485]  So let's play a few more of these questions and we'll go to Mike Adams.
[03:21:03.505 --> 03:21:03.785]  Here it is.
[03:21:03.805 --> 03:21:11.931]  Can you go into a bit more detail about where and how you exactly negotiated this deal?
[03:21:12.011 --> 03:21:15.513]  Did you meet with Epstein's attorney alone at a Marriott hotel?
[03:21:16.073 --> 03:21:23.118]  So, you know, I've read this and one of the things I find interesting is how facts
[03:21:24.639 --> 03:21:28.904]  Become facts because they're in a newspaper as opposed to the record.
[03:21:30.766 --> 03:21:43.922]  I pulled up I I found out the details of that meeting because I scratched my own head about it and I provided you a timeline in a letter of the negotiations that make it very clear that this was negotiated by career prosecutors.
[03:21:44.703 --> 03:21:46.104]  I'm going to answer your question.
[03:21:46.825 --> 03:21:55.130]  The meeting that was alleged was a breakfast meeting that took place after the agreement was negotiated, not before.
[03:21:55.490 --> 03:21:57.452]  The agreement was signed in September.
[03:21:58.352 --> 03:22:04.236]  After the agreement was negotiated, one of Epstein's attorneys asked for a meeting, asked for a hearing.
[03:22:04.857 --> 03:22:05.917]  I was giving a speech.
[03:22:06.098 --> 03:22:07.218]  I was staying at a hotel.
[03:22:07.759 --> 03:22:10.721]  I agreed to have a brief meeting, I believe at 7 a.m.
[03:22:11.361 --> 03:22:14.103]  Rather than open the office, I spoke with that
[03:22:14.783 --> 03:22:15.063]  PAUSE!
[03:22:42.776 --> 03:22:50.700]  You're seeing the mastery here of the corporate whores, though, where they turn Epstein and the Clintons and all this around onto somebody else.
[03:22:52.241 --> 03:22:56.623]  Whereas, let's say this guy's a horrible demon that helped cover it up and barely got him a prison sentence.
[03:22:57.203 --> 03:22:57.964]  Why is it him?
[03:22:57.984 --> 03:22:59.504]  Why is a little self-righteous woman?
[03:22:59.765 --> 03:23:01.886]  She's shaking her big five-foot-long hair and all.
[03:23:02.206 --> 03:23:02.866]  I'm on TV.
[03:23:02.946 --> 03:23:03.526]  I'm beautiful.
[03:23:06.548 --> 03:23:09.289]  And then she's sitting there defending the Clintons, defending all of it.
[03:23:09.409 --> 03:23:10.190]  It's just sick.
[03:23:10.870 --> 03:23:11.470]  It's sick.
[03:23:12.091 --> 03:23:12.571]  Let's continue.
[03:23:15.253 --> 03:23:16.814]  Did you hear this?
[03:23:17.294 --> 03:23:20.096]  The government met with the defense's lawyers.
[03:23:20.116 --> 03:23:21.317]  I've never heard of this before.
[03:23:33.168 --> 03:23:36.969]  That's like a piece of beef being between two hamburger buns or a hot dog.
[03:23:36.989 --> 03:23:39.629]  I mean, they just, again, it's the way they operate.
[03:23:39.669 --> 03:23:42.830]  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of kids are getting taken across the year.
[03:23:43.190 --> 03:23:44.470]  A bunch of them are coming up missing.
[03:23:44.750 --> 03:23:46.931]  Trump's got ten full busts of pedophiles going on.
[03:23:47.791 --> 03:23:51.592]  And the media is going to successfully turn this into Trump's a pedophile.
[03:23:51.932 --> 03:23:52.532]  They've already done it.
[03:23:53.112 --> 03:23:54.212]  There's no connection to Epstein.
[03:23:54.252 --> 03:23:55.132]  It's all the Democrats.
[03:23:55.512 --> 03:23:58.813]  But everyone grovels to them and goes, oh, let me have a press conference.
[03:23:59.353 --> 03:24:00.654]  Oh, I did something wrong.
[03:24:00.674 --> 03:24:01.614]  I'm so sorry.
[03:24:01.814 --> 03:24:02.874]  Just never ending.
[03:24:06.471 --> 03:24:07.132]  Let's go back to it.
[03:24:23.795 --> 03:24:28.159]  Number one, the agreement had already been locked in place, so the agreement wasn't going to change.
[03:24:28.659 --> 03:24:32.983]  Before that agreement, I was very careful to not negotiate this.
[03:24:33.223 --> 03:24:35.626]  Our career attorneys negotiated the agreement.
[03:24:36.166 --> 03:24:40.550]  Secondly, I'd point out, we live in a city where people have breakfast meetings all the time.
[03:24:40.590 --> 03:24:43.272]  You don't open an office at 7 o'clock in the morning.
[03:24:44.173 --> 03:24:45.094]  Just to have a meeting.
[03:24:45.274 --> 03:24:46.875]  You have it over breakfast.
[03:25:10.512 --> 03:25:14.013]  Let me, let me, let me do this.
[03:25:14.093 --> 03:25:17.194]  I had called you and I'll come back to you, I'll come back to you.
[03:25:17.294 --> 03:25:20.655]  I wanted to give you an opportunity.
[03:25:20.895 --> 03:25:26.817]  You mentioned several times that you and the prosecutors in your office
[03:25:27.697 --> 03:25:29.759]  Weren't sure that you could secure a win.
[03:25:30.319 --> 03:25:31.380]  Here, back this up.
[03:25:31.460 --> 03:25:35.883]  I love how these Democrats won't do a damn thing about child trafficking.
[03:25:36.364 --> 03:25:43.829]  All these newspapers say I'm a conspiracy theorist, because I say the deep state is using kidnapped children to compromise people, not just young women.
[03:25:43.869 --> 03:25:48.893]  I mean, they are raping little kids, they're killing them, snuff films, it's all come out in the NXIVM trial.
[03:25:49.694 --> 03:25:52.516]  And boy, these holy and righteous Democrats, though, they're like,
[03:25:53.497 --> 03:25:55.560]  Yeah, you think young girls deserve it!
[03:25:55.800 --> 03:25:57.982]  I mean, it is ridiculous.
[03:25:59.004 --> 03:26:01.386]  The holier-than-thou crap from these people.
[03:26:01.987 --> 03:26:03.509]  You covered up the WMDs.
[03:26:03.809 --> 03:26:05.191]  You covered up the open borders.
[03:26:05.211 --> 03:26:06.532]  You covered up the child smuggling.
[03:26:06.753 --> 03:26:08.174]  You covered up the opium epidemic.
[03:26:08.194 --> 03:26:09.836]  You covered up the ethanol scams.
[03:26:10.217 --> 03:26:11.538]  Trump's trying to fight all that.
[03:26:12.379 --> 03:26:12.920]  People tell me they go,
[03:26:13.826 --> 03:26:15.267]  Alex, you're so corrupt and evil.
[03:26:15.767 --> 03:26:22.071]  I have to go to the New York Times to make up lies about you because I have to atone for how we helped get Trump elected.
[03:26:22.111 --> 03:26:24.112]  I've had a former employee tell me this.
[03:26:25.133 --> 03:26:27.114]  I have to make up lies because you're bad.
[03:26:27.714 --> 03:26:28.235]  You got Trump.
[03:26:28.395 --> 03:26:32.858]  It's like these women that say Kavanaugh right, and they go, well, I made it up, but he's bad.
[03:26:35.193 --> 03:26:36.333]  He's Kavanaugh.
[03:26:36.874 --> 03:26:39.034]  He deserves to be told that he raped me.
[03:26:39.094 --> 03:26:39.855]  It's not true.
[03:26:40.655 --> 03:26:43.596]  But I'm a good person because Kavanaugh raped me.
[03:26:43.616 --> 03:26:47.937]  I talk to people, I go, you know I never did that.
[03:26:47.977 --> 03:26:49.718]  They go, but it doesn't matter, Trump's bad.
[03:26:49.738 --> 03:26:50.978]  I go, you're in a cult.
[03:26:51.058 --> 03:26:52.819]  They go, I'm gonna get you.
[03:26:52.839 --> 03:26:55.600]  The New York Times told me I was a good person.
[03:26:55.620 --> 03:26:58.020]  I mean, they want to be, it's demonic.
[03:26:58.160 --> 03:27:00.301]  They want to be patted by the New York Times.
[03:27:00.321 --> 03:27:02.962]  The New York Times goes, no, you were a good person.
[03:27:05.083 --> 03:27:06.283]  Mike Adams has taken over.
[03:27:06.663 --> 03:27:09.984]  Will Johnson's hosting came into town, did a great job.
[03:27:10.844 --> 03:27:15.665]  While Owen Schroer is up at the Trump event covering all that in D.C.
[03:27:16.565 --> 03:27:19.345]  And I'm sure they'll play more of this because this is unbelievable.
[03:27:19.505 --> 03:27:23.746]  I mean, this is just like, how dare you have prosecutors investigate pedophiles?
[03:27:24.346 --> 03:27:26.627]  How dare you stop kids being smuggled across the border?
[03:27:27.107 --> 03:27:27.907]  You know, how dare you?
[03:27:27.947 --> 03:27:28.387]  How dare you?
[03:27:28.427 --> 03:27:32.928]  But we have a 34-hour special broadcast that launches at 8 a.m.
[03:27:32.988 --> 03:27:33.648]  tomorrow.
[03:27:34.548 --> 03:27:37.150]  It's the 1776 Worldwide Transmission.
[03:27:37.210 --> 03:27:38.070]  I barely plugged it.
[03:27:38.130 --> 03:27:38.831]  I dropped the ball.
[03:27:39.251 --> 03:27:40.272]  Please tell your email.
[03:27:40.632 --> 03:27:45.315]  Please tell your text messages that say get across and get over the censors.
[03:27:45.615 --> 03:27:47.517]  Please tell your Facebook, your Twitter, your YouTube.
[03:27:47.897 --> 03:27:49.218]  Just don't say Alex Jones.
[03:27:49.238 --> 03:27:56.022]  Just say 1776 Special Broadcast Forbidden Information and get it out there and let the globalists know you're not going to be stopped.
[03:27:56.502 --> 03:27:57.083]  And separately.
[03:27:58.134 --> 03:28:00.176]  We have the 1776 Worldwide Special.
[03:28:01.056 --> 03:28:04.319]  All the t-shirts, all the books, all the films.
[03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:06.961]  A bunch of our best-selling supplements are $17.76.
[03:28:07.081 --> 03:28:13.907]  Everything else is $75 to 25% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:28:14.007 --> 03:28:16.609]  And we can do so much thanks to your support.
[03:28:16.649 --> 03:28:21.653]  But I'm telling you, what you see us doing on the surface is important.
[03:28:21.713 --> 03:28:22.254]  And it's me.
[03:28:22.934 --> 03:28:24.796]  But a lot of the folks you see out there
[03:28:25.799 --> 03:28:27.863]  In fact, most of the names you see, that's the real reason.
[03:28:28.223 --> 03:28:30.387]  And they already know this, I'm just going to tell you.
[03:28:30.788 --> 03:28:34.595]  A lot of the top people you see, I put hundreds of thousands of dollars in your money.
[03:28:35.660 --> 03:28:37.241]  By the way, I was just notified that
[03:29:05.505 --> 03:29:08.426]  Ross Perot has died at the age of 89.
[03:29:08.466 --> 03:29:17.547]  And of course, remember him for his runs in the presidency, but especially for his opposition to NAFTA.
[03:29:18.527 --> 03:29:19.027]  To NAFTA.
[03:29:19.967 --> 03:29:23.128]  He accurately predicted exactly what was going to happen with NAFTA.
[03:29:23.208 --> 03:29:25.088]  And of course, George H.W.
[03:29:25.108 --> 03:29:28.169]  Bush and Bill Clinton, they were both on board with it.
[03:29:28.349 --> 03:29:30.229]  So there wasn't any discussion between the two of them.
[03:29:31.149 --> 03:29:33.990]  Ross Perot had this to say about it.
[03:29:35.635 --> 03:29:38.498]  We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.
[03:29:39.739 --> 03:29:43.402]  To those of you in the audience who are business people, pretty simple.
[03:29:43.762 --> 03:29:55.372]  If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire a young 25... Let's assume you've been in business for a long time, you've got a mature workforce.
[03:29:56.053 --> 03:29:57.254]  Pay $1 an hour for your labor.
[03:29:58.570 --> 03:29:59.493]  Have no health care.
[03:29:59.633 --> 03:30:01.998]  That's the most expensive single element making a car.
[03:30:02.519 --> 03:30:06.508]  Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls, and no retirement.
[03:30:08.081 --> 03:30:13.383]  And you don't care about anything but making money, there will be a giant sucking sound going south.
[03:30:13.743 --> 03:30:15.123]  I'm the only guy that talks numbers.
[03:30:15.823 --> 03:30:16.344]  I love this.
[03:30:16.764 --> 03:30:18.244]  Nobody else will even talk about it.
[03:30:18.364 --> 03:30:20.305]  As I've said, it's like a crazy aunt in the basement.
[03:30:21.025 --> 03:30:22.866]  Everybody knows she's there, but nobody talks about her.
[03:30:23.546 --> 03:30:24.446]  I'm talking about it.
[03:30:24.826 --> 03:30:31.428]  Then I can talk, you know, with endless numbers about it, and then when I finish, typically the establishment press said, he didn't tell us enough.
[03:30:31.708 --> 03:30:32.829]  Now, just for the record,
[03:30:34.029 --> 03:30:35.570]  Uh, I don't have any spend doctors.
[03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:36.951]  I don't have any speech writers.
[03:30:37.572 --> 03:30:38.292]  Probably shows.
[03:30:39.553 --> 03:30:42.014]  Did you guys ever do anything but propaganda?
[03:30:42.134 --> 03:30:43.235]  Isn't it your business also?
[03:30:43.255 --> 03:30:44.776]  Would you even know the truth if you saw it?
[03:30:45.256 --> 03:30:46.377]  Oh, yes I... I don't believe you would.
[03:30:46.577 --> 03:30:53.141]  Now, when you've got a 7 to 1 wage differential between the United States and Mexico, you will hear the giant sucking sound.
[03:30:53.181 --> 03:30:53.622]  That's right.
[03:30:54.534 --> 03:30:59.236]  Look at wage costs, look at the lack of regulation, lack of health care costs.
[03:30:59.596 --> 03:31:01.977]  That's basically what's happened with China as well.
[03:31:02.017 --> 03:31:06.079]  The giant sucking sound of money going south.
[03:31:06.179 --> 03:31:07.399]  And of course he was absolutely right.
[03:31:08.120 --> 03:31:13.322]  We've had a rough parity of trade deficits between the US and Mexico, for example.
[03:31:14.322 --> 03:31:19.444]  Uh, it fluctuated from between two and five billion dollars each year.
[03:31:19.884 --> 03:31:20.804]  Some years, the U.S.
[03:31:20.824 --> 03:31:21.424]  would be ahead.
[03:31:21.624 --> 03:31:22.905]  Some years, Mexico would be ahead.
[03:31:22.965 --> 03:31:32.608]  But it never fluctuated by more than, uh, two to five billion dollars with one country some years ahead and the other one, uh, another year, the other country would have a surplus of trade.
[03:31:33.588 --> 03:31:35.129]  But after NAFTA was passed,
[03:31:36.206 --> 03:31:39.148]  The trade deficit with Mexico immediately jumped.
[03:31:39.188 --> 03:31:43.270]  Remember, it was trading in the 2 to 5, plus or minus 2 to 5 billion dollars.
[03:31:43.490 --> 03:31:46.051]  It jumped to 17 billion dollars.
[03:31:47.012 --> 03:31:49.013]  And it stayed there for the next two or three years.
[03:31:50.120 --> 03:31:54.442]  And it never got any lower than a $17 billion deficit.
[03:31:54.462 --> 03:31:59.884]  So you had a situation where, you know, some years we had a $2 to $5 billion trade surplus with Mexico.
[03:31:59.944 --> 03:32:02.285]  Some years they had the surplus with us.
[03:32:02.405 --> 03:32:03.745]  But it always was $2 to $5 billion.
[03:32:03.825 --> 03:32:04.425]  It jumps to $17 billion.
[03:32:04.445 --> 03:32:05.526]  It got as high as $72 billion.
[03:32:09.414 --> 03:32:12.276]  But it's now typically about, you know, 50-60 billion dollars a year.
[03:32:12.696 --> 03:32:15.297]  That is what is called a giant sucking sound.
[03:32:15.397 --> 03:32:21.181]  And of course, the establishment, both Democrat and Republican, was full on to go with that.
[03:32:22.241 --> 03:32:24.042]  And that's why these people hate President Trump so much.
[03:32:24.983 --> 03:32:28.405]  Because he said, we're not going to let that sucking continue.
[03:32:29.145 --> 03:32:30.306]  It's gotten much bigger.
[03:32:30.806 --> 03:32:32.527]  The problem has gotten much bigger with China.
[03:32:33.968 --> 03:32:35.208]  They all come after President Trump.
[03:32:35.248 --> 03:32:35.729]  Say, look at this!
[03:32:36.786 --> 03:32:38.207]  He invented tariffs!
[03:32:38.307 --> 03:32:39.128]  No, he didn't!
[03:32:40.610 --> 03:32:43.753]  Tariffs invented the United States, quite frankly.
[03:32:44.814 --> 03:32:55.664]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[03:32:56.184 --> 03:32:58.627]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:33:06.158 --> 03:33:10.602]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.350 --> 03:33:25.415]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[03:33:26.056 --> 03:33:27.918]  It's Mike Adams.
[03:33:28.358 --> 03:33:31.181]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:34.791]  All right, we've got some hard-hitting stories coming up here.
[03:33:34.831 --> 03:33:35.551]  Thanks for joining me.
[03:33:35.591 --> 03:33:42.854]  Mike Adams from Natural News filling in for the last couple of segments here on the Interval Wars Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:43.594 --> 03:33:56.839]  Just a quick note, it's going to bring you a story about California's nuclear power plants being built on or near the San Andreas fault line with an analysis of why that could unleash a Fukushima-style
[03:33:57.515 --> 03:34:05.080]  Catastrophe that could render Southern California uninhabitable for 300 years, at least uninhabitable by humans.
[03:34:05.500 --> 03:34:06.200]  So that's coming up.
[03:34:06.961 --> 03:34:16.707]  Also Google exposing itself as pro-pedophilia, pro-child abuse by opposing sex trafficking laws that would protect children.
[03:34:16.727 --> 03:34:19.949]  I'll give you a quick analysis of that situation as well.
[03:34:20.770 --> 03:34:21.270]  But you see,
[03:34:22.134 --> 03:34:33.000]  We are seeing the tech giants now collapse into terrorism, racketeering, child trafficking, cover-ups, every insane thing that you can imagine.
[03:34:34.021 --> 03:34:49.930]  And commenting on what you heard earlier in today's show with Facebook essentially endorsing calls for extreme violence and murder against Paul Joseph Watson and Alex Jones and Laura Loomer and others, we have now seen Facebook become
[03:34:51.081 --> 03:34:52.742]  An admitted terrorist organization.
[03:34:53.882 --> 03:35:01.705]  This is happening at the same time that Twitter is protecting Antifa, a domestic terrorism group that uses violence to achieve its desired outcomes.
[03:35:02.425 --> 03:35:08.147]  Google is protecting Antifa, another radical left-wing terrorist, and now Google is protecting child sex trafficking.
[03:35:08.808 --> 03:35:17.911]  While Democrat operatives are being arrested and indicted for child trafficking, child prostitution, and... What do you say?
[03:35:18.715 --> 03:35:28.439]  And grooming these young children, you know, extreme pedophilia, not even to mention the cultural assault on our children with the transgender indoctrination.
[03:35:29.280 --> 03:35:33.081]  And all that the mainstream media can do is say Trump is bad.
[03:35:33.281 --> 03:35:34.062]  Orange man bad.
[03:35:34.142 --> 03:35:34.402]  That's it.
[03:35:35.242 --> 03:35:42.005]  The media refuses to cover any of these critical stories about what's really happening in our world.
[03:35:42.145 --> 03:35:43.826]  They absolutely refuse to cover it.
[03:35:43.886 --> 03:35:50.730]  The media has become nothing but a radical left-wing smear machine, propaganda machine, lying machine.
[03:35:51.470 --> 03:35:57.353]  And this is why today I repeat my call for President Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act.
[03:35:58.393 --> 03:36:01.435]  And in my opinion, he should unleash military police to
[03:36:02.561 --> 03:36:25.002]  Occupy Facebook, Google, Twitter, YouTube and the others and arrest their CEOs for their criminal racketeering, their criminal terrorism, their complicity in child sex trafficking, which of course is one of the reasons why Democrats want to keep the border open so they can continue to funnel human cargo
[03:36:25.802 --> 03:36:30.963]  You know, underage girls and boys to big Democrat donors.
[03:36:31.403 --> 03:36:34.944]  And this whole house of cards is about to collapse.
[03:36:35.064 --> 03:36:36.005]  It's all coming down.
[03:36:36.925 --> 03:36:40.206]  And it's probably going to lead to civil war in America.
[03:36:42.106 --> 03:36:44.647]  I think that the radical left knows that that's coming.
[03:36:44.707 --> 03:36:54.009]  That's why they have this desperation, this acceleration of their insanity and their calls for censorship and their calls for just silencing and deplatforming everything that they don't like.
[03:36:56.309 --> 03:36:59.933]  And Civil War is the likely result of all of this.
[03:37:00.354 --> 03:37:02.757]  And I want to bring your attention to a video.
[03:37:03.658 --> 03:37:04.659]  Search for this, guys.
[03:37:04.719 --> 03:37:07.002]  It's called Civil War II in America.
[03:37:07.322 --> 03:37:08.183]  Who would win?
[03:37:08.804 --> 03:37:10.125]  By John Mark.
[03:37:10.946 --> 03:37:12.047]  It's currently on YouTube.
[03:37:12.067 --> 03:37:13.369]  It has about a million views.
[03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:15.792]  Now, as a disclaimer, I don't know who John Mark is.
[03:37:16.981 --> 03:37:20.922]  But this analysis by John Mark is spot on.
[03:37:21.362 --> 03:37:22.283]  It's right on the money.
[03:37:22.863 --> 03:37:25.323]  This video is fantastic.
[03:37:25.583 --> 03:37:27.184]  You need to watch this video.
[03:37:27.784 --> 03:37:42.428]  In this video, John Mark, again, who I don't know, but this is a great analysis that he's done, but John Mark has quoted a person who says he was part of a red team operations analysis group working for the United States government.
[03:37:42.998 --> 03:37:48.180]  Looking at what would happen in an actual civil war scenario if it were to break out in the United States.
[03:37:48.920 --> 03:38:04.184]  And what he points out in this video actually confirms what we've seen before in some other analyses by former special forces and so on that say the Achilles heel of the radical left is the power grid.
[03:38:05.124 --> 03:38:08.665]  The power grid feeds everything that the cities need to survive.
[03:38:08.705 --> 03:38:10.426]  The cities are where the Democrats are based.
[03:38:11.425 --> 03:38:14.147]  These cities, they have to have inputs in order to function.
[03:38:14.187 --> 03:38:25.077]  They have to have fuel deliveries, electricity deliveries, food deliveries, and water piped in, in the case of Los Angeles, literally pumped over a mountain into LA.
[03:38:26.158 --> 03:38:26.418]  And that
[03:38:27.190 --> 03:38:37.175]  These power grid substations and power grid infrastructure facilities, and I want to be clear, I'm not in any way advocating any kind of action or any kind of destruction of the power grid.
[03:38:37.515 --> 03:38:43.798]  I'm reporting to you what's being analyzed in this video of a possible civil war scenario.
[03:38:44.338 --> 03:38:55.824]  But in that scenario, it's pointed out by John Mark in this video that our national power grid was constructed at a time when no one ever thought that the power grid would be used
[03:38:56.650 --> 03:38:58.431]  Or targeted in a Civil War action.
[03:38:58.511 --> 03:39:02.894]  And thus, the entire power grid nationwide is completely unprotected.
[03:39:04.055 --> 03:39:10.519]  And as it's said in this video, the substations can be taken down by long-range snipers, i.e.
[03:39:10.619 --> 03:39:12.080]  military-range snipers.
[03:39:12.801 --> 03:39:24.208]  With certain cartridges, you know, .338 Lapua Magnum or .50 Cal or what have you, they can, from thousands of yards away, they can take down power substations that are completely undefended,
[03:39:24.958 --> 03:39:30.501]  And then using this principle of asymmetric warfare, they can plunge the liberal cities into absolute chaos.
[03:39:31.401 --> 03:39:43.427]  Now, many of these liberal cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle, and many others, Chicago, you know, they're already on the verge of collapse right now during the so-called good times in our economy.
[03:39:44.368 --> 03:39:50.591]  They are highly subject to systemic failures that could take place.
[03:39:51.392 --> 03:39:52.112]  And because of that,
[03:39:54.056 --> 03:39:57.978]  This asymmetric warfare could target them and take them down.
[03:39:59.079 --> 03:40:04.082]  Now, give me a word back here, guys.
[03:40:04.162 --> 03:40:07.604]  Make sure that we're still connected, because I'm seeing some issues.
[03:40:09.125 --> 03:40:09.645]  Okay, all right.
[03:40:09.926 --> 03:40:11.407]  So just continuing.
[03:40:11.447 --> 03:40:18.491]  I don't know if we're being interrupted because of what I'm saying here, because of this analysis, but these cities in
[03:40:19.682 --> 03:40:23.645]  California and other liberal strongholds are highly vulnerable to this.
[03:40:24.185 --> 03:40:30.089]  And this is why, for your safety, I want to urge you to get out of the West Coast of California.
[03:40:30.750 --> 03:40:34.693]  Get out before this thing goes into a collapse scenario.
[03:40:35.353 --> 03:40:48.122]  And there's another reason that I'm going to bring to you in the next segment, coming up in just a few minutes, about the nuclear catastrophe that could happen due to the movement of tectonic plates in California and the San Andreas Fault.
[03:40:48.706 --> 03:40:57.212]  But I want you to understand, just to summarize that Civil War II analysis video, I want you to understand, if this goes to a civil war, the left loses.
[03:40:58.013 --> 03:41:00.094]  The left loses almost overnight.
[03:41:00.835 --> 03:41:04.977]  Because all the firearms are in the hands of pro-America supporters.
[03:41:05.858 --> 03:41:18.407]  The former military, active duty military, and even law enforcement, are all, in fact, are mostly on the side of America, on the side of protecting our borders, protecting our Constitution, and even defending our President.
[03:41:19.167 --> 03:41:25.592]  So the President himself, I believe, needs to invoke the Insurrection Act and take down the enemies of America.
[03:41:25.953 --> 03:41:27.053]  It's time for that to happen.
[03:41:27.894 --> 03:41:30.136]  And those enemies are becoming more bold, like Facebook.
[03:41:30.993 --> 03:41:39.879]  Which is of course calling for, essentially endorsing, embracing extreme violence and the mass killing of certain named individuals like Paul Joseph Watson and Laura Loomer.
[03:41:40.259 --> 03:41:55.909]  And by the way, just as a side comedy note, isn't it interesting that Mark Zuckerberg, it came out in the news recently, Zuckerberg has commanded Facebook to go to extraordinary lengths to censor all comments on Facebook that characterize Mark Zuckerberg as an alien.
[03:41:56.832 --> 03:42:00.956]  Which is, as I say comedically, exactly what an alien would do.
[03:42:01.396 --> 03:42:01.656]  Isn't it?
[03:42:03.098 --> 03:42:03.478]  Who knows?
[03:42:03.498 --> 03:42:04.519]  I don't know what that guy is.
[03:42:04.919 --> 03:42:06.160]  I don't know if he's a cyborg.
[03:42:06.521 --> 03:42:07.401]  I don't know if he's an alien.
[03:42:07.421 --> 03:42:08.342]  I don't know if he's a demon.
[03:42:09.043 --> 03:42:10.584]  What I know is he's not human.
[03:42:11.025 --> 03:42:11.705]  That's for sure.
[03:42:12.186 --> 03:42:13.667]  Because his agenda is not human.
[03:42:14.067 --> 03:42:16.930]  In fact, so much of the agenda that we're seeing right now is anti-human.
[03:42:17.594 --> 03:42:30.343]  Look, all across the tech giants, all across the left-wing media, all across the institutions of science and medicine, and think about it, pesticides, the food industry, the food supply, politics, banking, finance, it's all anti-human.
[03:42:30.976 --> 03:42:43.463]  The anti-human agenda is in charge, and it is desperately trying to destroy humanity and destroy any person or any institution that speaks out to defend humanity, like Alex Jones, like InfoWars, and so on.
[03:42:43.944 --> 03:42:50.727]  If you defend humanity, you are targeted for destruction, because humanity has been slated for annihilation.
[03:42:50.827 --> 03:42:51.888]  That's their ultimate goal.
[03:42:52.588 --> 03:42:56.831]  I'll have the nuclear analysis straight ahead after we return from this coming break.
[03:42:56.851 --> 03:42:57.451]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:57.872 --> 03:42:58.412]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:02.459 --> 03:43:09.103]  Folks, we are launching another limited edition right now t-shirt.
[03:43:09.163 --> 03:43:10.864]  We're only going to have 4,000 of these.
[03:43:10.984 --> 03:43:14.806]  There's four different variants, two different shirts in white and a navy blue.
[03:43:14.986 --> 03:43:16.107]  I'm very excited about it.
[03:43:16.247 --> 03:43:21.770]  It is the Betsy Ross flag, the first flag made by an abolitionist, made by an American.
[03:43:21.971 --> 03:43:23.011]  She came up with the design.
[03:43:23.031 --> 03:43:26.633]  It's a beautiful flag, one of the most recognizable in history, if not world history.
[03:43:26.793 --> 03:43:27.594]  And it's a white
[03:43:27.754 --> 03:43:27.934]  Sure.
[03:43:48.100 --> 03:43:49.781]  Two different variants, two different colors.
[03:43:49.821 --> 03:43:51.042]  That's four shirts.
[03:43:51.122 --> 03:43:53.444]  We're printing a thousand of each.
[03:43:53.665 --> 03:43:55.706]  The order was put in yesterday.
[03:43:55.866 --> 03:43:58.609]  The place where they make them in America is printing them now.
[03:43:58.749 --> 03:44:01.691]  They'll be shipped to us by next week, two weeks for delivery.

[03:44:39.813 --> 03:44:41.794]  Robert Baric, what has Big Tech become?
[03:44:41.834 --> 03:44:43.835]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[03:44:43.875 --> 03:44:50.419]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[03:44:50.539 --> 03:45:00.084]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the public officials that care about this, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this,
[03:45:00.504 --> 03:45:02.305]  And let's be absolutely crystal clear here.
[03:45:02.345 --> 03:45:08.169]  Big railroads and big steel and big oil had Pinkerton security, killed thousands, were horribly corrupt, gouged small-time farmers, ran all sorts of scams.
[03:45:08.189 --> 03:45:09.070]  But they weren't reading all your mail.
[03:45:27.443 --> 03:45:33.785]  They didn't know what bra size your wife wears or what size tampons and what you like to watch porn wise.
[03:45:33.805 --> 03:45:35.125]  They didn't know what was in your bank account.
[03:45:35.325 --> 03:45:38.006]  They didn't know what god you worship or don't worship.
[03:45:38.266 --> 03:45:46.048]  This is omnipresent level abuse and coupled with the monopolies, it is the ultimate Mark of the Beast style nightmare system.
[03:45:46.268 --> 03:45:53.050]  And remember, InfoWars was the vanguard of being banned first, the most banned, and the vanguard of fighting it.
[03:45:53.250 --> 03:45:55.491]  Because we are the vanguard!
[03:45:55.891 --> 03:45:57.513]  You are the vanguard!
[03:45:57.653 --> 03:45:59.314]  Step into the history, folks!
[03:45:59.414 --> 03:46:04.379]  The InfoWars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world.
[03:46:04.419 --> 03:46:20.935]  And that's the reason why, because it created this little-d democratic experiment in independent free press, independent free speech, of ordinary Americans coming together collectively and aggregately, through their financial support of InfoWars, to make real the original promise of an independent free press, to make real the actions of independent free speech.
[03:46:21.135 --> 03:46:31.320]  In our electoral arena, in our social and cultural influential arena that shapes people's minds, shapes people's thoughts, to where you can choose your own news and your own views and share and spread those with the rest of the world.
[03:46:31.600 --> 03:46:37.182]  That is why it was the target for a totalitarian, authoritarian, control-oriented, big tech, big media collusion.
[03:46:37.202 --> 03:46:38.923]  They used our openness as our weakness.
[03:46:38.943 --> 03:46:39.363]  Precisely.
[03:46:39.423 --> 03:46:40.824]  It's real collusion.
[03:46:40.964 --> 03:46:47.747]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shape people's thoughts.
[03:46:47.907 --> 03:46:50.508]  You're in the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[03:46:50.568 --> 03:46:52.068]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[03:46:52.368 --> 03:46:54.088]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[03:46:54.289 --> 03:46:55.729]  Even it is what you just saw.
[03:47:06.151 --> 03:47:08.772]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.729 --> 03:47:27.714]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:28.314 --> 03:47:31.657]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[03:47:33.819 --> 03:47:34.580]  Alright, listen up, folks.
[03:47:34.600 --> 03:47:41.586]  I'm gonna have to blaze through this pretty quickly because this is about the nuclear meltdown threat in California.
[03:47:42.307 --> 03:47:59.042]  An analysis that we did, I asked my team to look at the geolocations of the active and so-called decommissioned nuclear power plants in California that are still storing nuclear fuel on site, and then to overlay those geolocations with the San Andreas fault line.
[03:47:59.722 --> 03:48:03.906]  And for the producers, there's a map there in that article that you can show that shows this.
[03:48:04.266 --> 03:48:08.150]  So what we find is that this fault line
[03:48:08.900 --> 03:48:12.542]  Which of course runs sort of parallel to the west coast of California.
[03:48:12.582 --> 03:48:19.046]  The San Andreas fault line is very close to five out of six of these nuclear power plants.
[03:48:19.386 --> 03:48:20.707]  Not far away at all.
[03:48:21.167 --> 03:48:27.851]  And we've also overlaid that with a risk map showing the color-coded risk of severe earthquakes in the next 30 years.
[03:48:28.291 --> 03:48:34.615]  And you'll find that an astonishing number of these nuclear power plants in California were built in high-risk zones.
[03:48:35.385 --> 03:48:36.425]  Seems insane, doesn't it?
[03:48:36.505 --> 03:48:46.549]  Only one of them was built in a low-risk zone, and one of the power plants, the Humboldt plant, I believe up near north of San Francisco, was built almost exactly on the San Andreas fault line.
[03:48:47.249 --> 03:48:55.311]  Another plant, the current active plant, the Diablo Canyon plant, was built on the ocean line, the coastline, right on the ocean.
[03:48:55.331 --> 03:49:00.633]  It uses ocean water for cooling, which mimics the situation of the Fukushima Daiichi power plants in
[03:49:01.532 --> 03:49:01.913]  Japan.
[03:49:02.433 --> 03:49:08.197]  Now, what this means is that California has a Fukushima type of scenario already set up and ready to be triggered.
[03:49:08.697 --> 03:49:16.123]  All it's going to take is one ocean earthquake, and that nuclear power plant will be inundated with a massive tidal wave.
[03:49:17.164 --> 03:49:18.484]  Tsunami, you could say.
[03:49:19.085 --> 03:49:27.351]  I guess it's not a tidal wave, it's an earthquake-caused wave, not caused by Moon's gravity, but let's call it a tsunami, that could swamp that nuclear power facility.
[03:49:28.218 --> 03:49:41.611]  And, in fact, there are underwater volcanoes, underwater earthquakes all throughout the Pacific, and an underwater caldera, kind of like Yellowstone, but it's located hundreds of miles to the west of the coast of Oregon.
[03:49:42.432 --> 03:49:45.095]  Any of these events could be set off at any time.
[03:49:45.815 --> 03:49:47.357]  We can't predict them as humans.
[03:49:48.438 --> 03:49:49.779]  Even our best scientists can't predict them.
[03:49:50.500 --> 03:49:51.461]  At any given time,
[03:49:52.330 --> 03:50:00.097]  An ocean wave could travel faster than the speed of sound and can inundate that Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and cause a meltdown.
[03:50:01.018 --> 03:50:02.839]  Also, an earthquake could cause this as well.
[03:50:02.900 --> 03:50:04.461]  Now, a couple things you need to know about this.
[03:50:04.821 --> 03:50:06.363]  Number one, the San Andreas Fault Line.
[03:50:06.423 --> 03:50:07.364]  What is it exactly?
[03:50:08.044 --> 03:50:10.566]  Well, you need to think about two continents colliding.
[03:50:11.067 --> 03:50:14.250]  The west coast that's west of the San Andreas Fault Line, that thin
[03:50:15.171 --> 03:50:27.602]  A strip of land that encompasses, what, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco and others, that is part of really a different continent, you might say, a different tectonic plate, actually, that's moving to the north.
[03:50:29.183 --> 03:50:39.032]  Now, everything east of the San Andreas Fault line is not moving to the north, it's moving slightly to the south, or you could say it's not moving at all because it's moving very little, relatively speaking.
[03:50:39.614 --> 03:50:50.179]  What this means is that there are going to be massive earthquakes because these continents, essentially these plates, are shifting relative to each other on a known speed.
[03:50:50.739 --> 03:50:58.122]  And when you have a long period of no earthquakes or very low frequency of earthquakes, what it means is that the tectonic plates are building up massive tension.
[03:50:58.902 --> 03:51:00.383]  A lot of energy is being built up.
[03:51:01.064 --> 03:51:08.467]  Like pulling back a catapult locking mechanism, you know, and eventually that energy has to be released.
[03:51:08.827 --> 03:51:14.770]  So the longer that the earthquakes have been quiet, the bigger the release of energy when it's finally unleashed.
[03:51:15.730 --> 03:51:24.134]  You can have a massive slippage of the tectonic plates, and this is going to cause a very high intensity earthquake.
[03:51:25.600 --> 03:51:27.282]  The big one is what's concerned.
[03:51:27.943 --> 03:51:32.349]  That is the concern of people who are living in California and watching all of this because a big one, i.e.
[03:51:32.449 --> 03:51:40.320]  a 9.0 on the Richter scale, which is 100 times larger than a 7.0, could destroy all these nuclear power facilities.
[03:51:41.033 --> 03:52:01.886]  And even the power facilities that are so-called decommissioned, many of them are actually in a state called SafeStore, which PG&E, the California power company, says that SafeStore stores the nuclear fuel on-site in cooling pools, and then they cool this nuclear fuel for many, many years until one day they actually remove the nuclear fuel.
[03:52:02.567 --> 03:52:06.509]  But it's not clear which of these plants still have nuclear fuel stored on-site.
[03:52:06.549 --> 03:52:09.331]  We know some of them do, but it's not clear which ones don't.
[03:52:10.189 --> 03:52:17.692]  And a 9.0 earthquake could collapse the containment pools, which is exactly what happened in Fukushima.
[03:52:18.192 --> 03:52:31.317]  It could collapse the containment structure, collapse the concrete buildings, and it could cause offline fuel to come into close contact because it's fissionable material and it can reach criticality.
[03:52:31.817 --> 03:52:39.300]  So you can have meltdowns of nuclear fuel in offline nuclear power plants following an earthquake or a tsunami or some other natural event.
[03:52:39.972 --> 03:52:43.594]  Now then, when that happens, you have the release of radioisotopes, of course.
[03:52:44.194 --> 03:52:51.057]  You get strontium-90, you get cesium-137, you get various isotopes of plutonium and uranium.
[03:52:51.097 --> 03:52:56.119]  Some of those decay into americium and other elements, depending on the schedule of the half-lives.
[03:52:56.879 --> 03:53:07.123]  But cesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years, which means that Southern California would be made uninhabitable by humans for about 300 years.
[03:53:08.124 --> 03:53:09.084]  Now, I know what you're thinking.
[03:53:09.901 --> 03:53:14.064]  You might be thinking, well gosh, Los Angeles is barely habitable by humans right now.
[03:53:14.244 --> 03:53:16.706]  You know, you look at the feces on the streets of San Francisco.
[03:53:16.726 --> 03:53:17.907]  You look at the tent-filled cities.
[03:53:18.388 --> 03:53:19.829]  You look at the collapse of California.
[03:53:21.250 --> 03:53:21.410]  But...
[03:53:22.293 --> 03:53:23.234]  It's not radioactive yet.
[03:53:23.794 --> 03:53:45.794]  It could be made radioactive overnight because the geniuses in California built nuclear power plants right along the San Andreas fault line, which is about as insane and suicidal as building a nuclear power facility on the coastline of Japan in the Ring of Fire, where underground earthquakes and volcanoes and tsunamis are a regular occurrence.
[03:53:46.875 --> 03:53:48.256]  This is a situation we are all in.
[03:53:49.269 --> 03:53:53.573]  The sad news is that this isn't just a danger to California, it's a danger to all of North America.
[03:53:54.393 --> 03:54:00.819]  And yet people are living right there in California and thinking the government's taking care of them, thinking PG&E has this under control.
[03:54:01.840 --> 03:54:10.627]  Back in 2014, PG&E requested about a billion dollars just to continue the decommissioning effort for one nuclear power plant there.
[03:54:10.647 --> 03:54:11.828]  I think that was the Humboldt plant.
[03:54:12.546 --> 03:54:20.569]  And they've scheduled the Diablo Canyon plant to be decommissioned in the year 2025, but that process might take a decade or longer and require billions of dollars.
[03:54:21.210 --> 03:54:21.790]  But guess what?
[03:54:22.330 --> 03:54:25.651]  In January of this year, PG&E declared bankruptcy.
[03:54:26.432 --> 03:54:41.398]  And the state of California is suffering an economic collapse, as the taxpayers are fleeing the state, and the state promises to have free health care for illegal aliens and other handouts, so that Democrats can stay in power and continue to destroy everything that they run.
[03:54:42.375 --> 03:54:44.395]  California will financially collapse.
[03:54:44.775 --> 03:55:03.619]  When it does, my question to you is, who will continue to cool the nuclear fuel rods at these multiple nuclear facilities that are subject to earthquakes and volcanoes and underground tsunamis, I mean, ocean tsunamis and underground under-ocean caldera explosions and other types of phenomena like that?
[03:55:04.199 --> 03:55:05.479]  Who's going to pay the money?
[03:55:06.000 --> 03:55:07.980]  Who's going to have the proficiency
[03:55:08.743 --> 03:55:12.386]  To deal with this nuclear fuel, and the answer is nobody.
[03:55:12.766 --> 03:55:14.508]  Because government is incompetent.
[03:55:15.249 --> 03:55:18.411]  Instead of fixing these problems, they will turn off the dosimeters.
[03:55:18.772 --> 03:55:21.073]  They will lie to you and say they have it under control.
[03:55:21.594 --> 03:55:28.220]  They'll call it clean, green energy, while you're being killed with cesium-137 exposure.
[03:55:28.720 --> 03:55:33.264]  Because government is incompetent, and the California government is criminally incompetent.
[03:55:33.820 --> 03:55:44.446]  If you are living anywhere in California, you are living in a future hot radiation zone, a Mad Max collapse, nuclear apocalypse scenario.
[03:55:44.986 --> 03:55:48.809]  You need to get out just to have any chance to survive at all.
[03:55:49.829 --> 03:55:52.711]  Now, there's more to this story, and it involves Chernobyl.
[03:55:52.731 --> 03:55:53.892]  Remember the nuclear disaster of 1986?
[03:55:54.252 --> 03:55:59.655]  Chernobyl went into a meltdown.
[03:56:00.754 --> 03:56:12.260]  The Russian government, Soviet Union at the time, because Ukraine was a republic of the Soviet Union, they hurriedly put a lot of concrete and they entombed that nuclear disaster in what was called the sarcophagus.
[03:56:12.720 --> 03:56:19.803]  Well, the lifetime of that thing, which had no foundation, was estimated to be only 25 to 30 years and it started crumbling.
[03:56:20.363 --> 03:56:20.543]  So in 2007,
[03:56:22.179 --> 03:56:34.847]  European nations, led by a French engineering firm and funded by the United States, Japan and others, decided to build a new covering over the Chernobyl power plant because the fuel there will threaten humanity for 24,000 years.
[03:56:34.867 --> 03:56:35.628]  Chernobyl's not over.
[03:56:38.047 --> 03:56:42.528]  So they spent a lot of money and over a decade building a new cover.
[03:56:42.988 --> 03:56:43.968]  It's an arched cover.
[03:56:44.329 --> 03:56:45.009]  It's there now.
[03:56:45.129 --> 03:56:46.469]  They completed this, I think, in 2017.
[03:56:47.329 --> 03:56:48.009]  But guess what?
[03:56:48.410 --> 03:56:55.171]  Because there's so much radiation in there, you can't maintain the steel beams that are constructing this arch.
[03:56:55.791 --> 03:56:58.472]  So you have to prevent corrosion, which is caused by
[03:56:59.841 --> 03:57:00.301]  Humidity.
[03:57:00.922 --> 03:57:23.079]  So they are running right now, 24-7, they are running massive dehumidifiers to dehumidify the air to prevent that arch from corroding and collapsing and releasing hundreds of times the nuclear contamination of the Hiroshima bomb into the environment because Chernobyl's not over and this arch is only slated to last a hundred years.
[03:57:24.102 --> 03:57:29.764]  And that's if they can keep the dehumidifiers running, which will stop if there's a financial collapse.
[03:57:29.944 --> 03:57:30.584]  Think about that.
[03:57:31.325 --> 03:57:33.245]  We are not out of the woods on any of this.
[03:57:33.746 --> 03:57:34.306]  Things are bad.
