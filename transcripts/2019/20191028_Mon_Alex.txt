[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:04.852]  Gavin McInnes is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.TV.
[00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:09.536]  Gavin McInnes, Joe Biggs, Miley Yiannopoulos, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.TV.
[00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:28.519]  Where are you from, son?
[00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.580]  New Mexico?
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.402]  ISIS!
[00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:34.087]  Yeah, I was a prisoner in Syria until last week when you freed me.
[00:00:34.087 --> 00:00:38.894]  So, uh, I just wanted to say thank you for bringing jobs back.
[00:00:38.894 --> 00:00:40.457]  To ISIS.
[00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.880]  And I promise that I will make ISIS great again!
[00:00:44.997 --> 00:00:47.239]  Now what do you have to say, NeverTrumpers?
[00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:55.044]  As we leave one of the many foreign entanglements in Syria that George Washington warned us about, President Trump cuts the head off the snake.
[00:00:55.044 --> 00:01:02.410]  Last night the United States brought the world's number one terrorist leader to justice.
[00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.673]  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.
[00:01:08.086 --> 00:01:14.909]  He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world.
[00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.431]  He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.
[00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:37.277]  The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him.
[00:01:38.769 --> 00:01:58.336]  We were in the compound for approximately two hours, and after the mission was accomplished, we took highly sensitive material and information from the raid, much having to do with ISIS, origins, future plans, things that we very much want.
[00:01:58.336 --> 00:02:01.158]  Have you notified the congressional leaders about this?
[00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:02.838]  Pelosi?
[00:02:02.838 --> 00:02:04.959]  We've notified some.
[00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.020]  Others are being notified now as I speak.
[00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:14.855]  We were going to notify him last night but we decided not to do that because Washington leaks like I've never seen before.
[00:02:14.855 --> 00:02:19.859]  There's nothing, there's no country in the world that leaks like we do.
[00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:25.203]  And Washington is a leaking machine and I told my people we will not notify them until
[00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:28.746]  Our great people are out.
[00:02:28.746 --> 00:02:30.047]  Not just in, but out.
[00:02:30.047 --> 00:02:36.573]  No matter how much they spend, the Never Trumpers will never be able to put their finger on the pulse of the American people.
[00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:44.840]  Amazingly, they are openly campaigning to return America back to the path it was on, as America spiraled towards an end to its sovereignty.
[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.001]  He's a complete isolationist, and he wants to will out of existence every other country in the world, it seems.
[00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:55.062]  America first, last, and always.
[00:02:55.062 --> 00:02:59.123]  Again, the president's ignorance in foreign affairs is maddening.
[00:02:59.123 --> 00:03:04.763]  He opposed our joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership on the ground that it would be dominated by China.
[00:03:04.763 --> 00:03:11.205]  Is the Trump administration coming anywhere near the future of work and the future of education?
[00:03:11.205 --> 00:03:12.245]  No, they're not.
[00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:12.845]  And you know why?
[00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:15.527]  Because it takes too much work.
[00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:27.216]  With all of their whimpering from their echo chamber of collusion delusion, not one of these globalist tools can come to terms with the monumental accomplishment President Trump has doled out to the American middle class.
[00:03:27.216 --> 00:03:36.643]  In an article by Real Clear Politics, largely overlooked by the Mockingbird Media, according to new Census Bureau data on the incomes of America's middle class,
[00:03:36.843 --> 00:03:47.077]  This study by former Census Bureau researchers and now statisticians at Sentier Research has found gigantic income gains for the middle class under Trump.
[00:03:47.077 --> 00:03:51.903]  The median or average income family has seen a gain of $5,003 since Trump came into office.
[00:03:54.326 --> 00:04:00.949]  Under George W. Bush, the household income gains were a little over $400 in eight years.
[00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.571]  And under Barack Obama, the gains were $1,043.
[00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:07.773]  That was in eight years for each.
[00:04:07.773 --> 00:04:13.916]  Under Trump, in less than three years, the extra income is about three times larger.
[00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:18.278]  We are led by very, very stupid people.
[00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:23.790]  Very, very stupid people.
[00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.392]  We can't beat ISIS.
[00:04:25.392 --> 00:04:27.456]  Give me a break.
[00:04:27.456 --> 00:04:29.659]  We can't beat anybody.
[00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.802]  Our vets are being treated horribly.
[00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:35.068]  It will change.
[00:04:35.068 --> 00:04:40.609]  We will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning.
[00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:48.812]  Dubbing the politicians and their mockingbird media conspirers never-Trumpers actually gives these goons of globalism too much credit.
[00:04:48.812 --> 00:04:54.614]  They should be called anti-populist, which ultimately adds up to anti-Americans.
[00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:58.655]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:58.655 --> 00:05:01.136]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, on this Monday edition.
[00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:02.824]  You don't want to stay with us?
[00:05:02.824 --> 00:05:03.144]  Believe it.
[00:05:03.144 --> 00:05:04.625]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:05.946]  Stay with us.
[00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:11.149]  Hello today on All Things Considered.
[00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:13.150]  I'm Wilbur Snakely.
[00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.675]  I should tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:24.478]  Now sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that
[00:05:24.978 --> 00:05:30.725]  It's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[00:05:30.725 --> 00:05:31.666]  That's right.
[00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:33.528]  Drink the fluoride.
[00:05:33.528 --> 00:05:37.894]  Don't visit Infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen.
[00:05:37.894 --> 00:05:39.335]  I mean the bad halogen.
[00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:40.056]  Iodine.
[00:05:40.056 --> 00:05:42.840]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.005]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us.
[00:05:50.005 --> 00:05:51.667]  We don't want to compete with you.
[00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:54.329]  Just drink the fluoride.
[00:05:54.329 --> 00:06:00.253]  Don't learn about how deadly it is, and whatever you do, don't support Alex Jones.
[00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:04.677]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm liberal.
[00:06:04.677 --> 00:06:06.838]  Oh, and let Nambla have access to your children.
[00:06:11.968 --> 00:06:18.387]  Yeah, we're good.
[00:06:20.223 --> 00:06:25.046]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:25.046 --> 00:06:26.747]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:26.747 --> 00:06:28.408]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:28.408 --> 00:06:34.072]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:34.072 --> 00:06:35.652]  It is Monday, October 28th, 2019.
[00:06:35.652 --> 00:06:41.636]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[00:06:41.636 --> 00:06:46.219]  Lord willing, we'll be here live for the next four hours.
[00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:47.620]  Nothing is certain these days, is it?
[00:06:49.858 --> 00:06:53.080]  Russia's been testing its internet kill switch.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.342]  The United States has been testing its internet kill switch.
[00:06:56.342 --> 00:07:01.545]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to tell you one of the main reasons why.
[00:07:01.545 --> 00:07:04.707]  The world is heating up in a lot of ways.
[00:07:04.707 --> 00:07:08.830]  The big question is, did U.S.
[00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:15.854]  Special Forces really kill al-Baghdadi Saturday, and then we learned about it Sunday?
[00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:17.575]  That's the big question.
[00:07:17.575 --> 00:07:19.156]  Because we've been lied to so much,
[00:07:20.598 --> 00:07:26.543]  A lot of people just don't believe anything that the federal government says out of hand.
[00:07:26.543 --> 00:07:29.426]  But I have the answer.
[00:07:29.426 --> 00:07:35.391]  I know whether Al Baghdadi was really killed or not.
[00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:45.860]  Because we have the history, we have the evidence, we have the facts, and we have the policy continuum through which this decision was made.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.201]  So I'll tell you next segment,
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:55.542]  More conclusively, really, than anybody else can, other than the people that killed al-Baghdadi, we're told.
[00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:59.804]  So that's coming up next segment.
[00:07:59.804 --> 00:08:01.545]  Also, things are heating up big time.
[00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:05.866]  We learned last Thursday evening that there are criminal indictments, as we told you months ago.
[00:08:05.866 --> 00:08:09.048]  Those are confirmed of certainty individuals.
[00:08:09.048 --> 00:08:10.788]  Now, those could still be shut down.
[00:08:10.788 --> 00:08:13.349]  They could be blocked by the Deputy Attorney General.
[00:08:13.349 --> 00:08:14.990]  That's how the law works.
[00:08:18.049 --> 00:08:23.892]  When it's internal, dealing with the Justice Department or a former FBI director.
[00:08:23.892 --> 00:08:29.676]  All hell is breaking loose.
[00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.877]  And now we know those criminal investigations are ongoing.
[00:08:32.877 --> 00:08:34.378]  That's why we're seeing so many fireworks.
[00:08:34.378 --> 00:08:39.361]  That's why we're seeing Comey, former director of the FBI, saying he's defiant.
[00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:42.082]  He's not worried about it a single bit.
[00:08:42.082 --> 00:08:44.124]  But he went on to say he's getting ready to move.
[00:08:44.946 --> 00:08:48.948]  To New Zealand, the getaway for all the globalists.
[00:08:48.948 --> 00:08:53.311]  That's their main hideout.
[00:08:53.311 --> 00:08:54.992]  Their main escape zone.
[00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:56.793]  Their main escape pod.
[00:08:56.793 --> 00:09:03.897]  So we'll be getting to those video clips here today.
[00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:05.878]  But President Trump is pointing out
[00:09:07.315 --> 00:09:08.836]  That this is a criminal enterprise.
[00:09:08.836 --> 00:09:10.916]  He made more statements today.
[00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:24.361]  Now, the response of the left to all this is to take the slogan that our listeners started with the Hillary for Prison 2016 maxim that then turned into, lock her up.
[00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:34.404]  And it was our listeners, I didn't even come up with that plan, our listeners that would go to the Hillary events and say, Bill Clinton's a rapist, and lock her up.
[00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:38.451]  For her criminal activities.
[00:09:38.451 --> 00:09:40.712]  And boy, now they're trying to use that against Trump.
[00:09:40.712 --> 00:09:45.394]  But it rings hollow because Trump's been delivering on every front.
[00:09:45.394 --> 00:09:48.696]  And there's nothing there to lock him up for.
[00:09:48.696 --> 00:09:53.179]  But here's Trump when he popped by the World Series.
[00:09:53.179 --> 00:09:53.719]  Here's what happened.
[00:09:57.245 --> 00:10:04.188]  I watched this video this morning.
[00:10:17.619 --> 00:10:20.400]  It's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.823]  Watch fans boo, chant, lock him up after Trump announced it World Series.
[00:10:25.823 --> 00:10:27.684]  And the crowd saw the President on the big screen.
[00:10:27.684 --> 00:10:29.285]  Many began booing.
[00:10:29.285 --> 00:10:30.325]  That's the Balkanization.
[00:10:30.325 --> 00:10:31.106]  That's the brainwashing.
[00:10:31.106 --> 00:10:33.787]  But I watched the video very closely.
[00:10:33.787 --> 00:10:35.188]  I paused it second by second.
[00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:38.883]  And you see one guy shaking his fist.
[00:10:38.883 --> 00:10:40.184]  You can see the faces of people.
[00:10:40.184 --> 00:10:43.207]  And I counted the faces of 50, 60 people.
[00:10:43.207 --> 00:10:46.029]  You can see clearly, if you're a radio listener, you can go see it on News Wars.
[00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:48.031]  If you're a TV viewer, you're seeing it like I am.
[00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:54.917]  But if you pause the tape, second by second, almost no one is chanting, lock him up.
[00:10:54.917 --> 00:10:56.979]  They're talking to each other.
[00:10:56.979 --> 00:10:58.360]  You see one guy shake his fist.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.581]  Maybe he's saying, lock him up.
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:09.831]  So, you do not really see it there, which is very strange, because you hear the chant over the video.
[00:11:09.831 --> 00:11:12.354]  And with as much stuff as the left's been caught staging.
[00:11:12.354 --> 00:11:18.401]  Town halls, events, riots, Jussie Smollett type events.
[00:11:19.468 --> 00:11:22.270]  This could easily have been dubbed over as well.
[00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:28.034]  I'm not saying there isn't a large minority of people that have succumbed to the brainwashing or saying, lock him up.
[00:11:28.034 --> 00:11:31.476]  It's just that I watched not just this video, several others.
[00:11:31.476 --> 00:11:34.718]  Uh, and it's a very, very, very, very strange that you're looking at people.
[00:11:34.718 --> 00:11:41.342]  You can't see anyone saying it, but that you hear it supposedly over the loudspeakers.
[00:11:41.342 --> 00:11:41.823]  We don't know.
[00:11:41.823 --> 00:11:43.204]  Maybe it was dubbed over.
[00:11:43.204 --> 00:11:44.965]  This is the type of stuff you've got to look for.
[00:11:44.965 --> 00:11:48.207]  Remember, there's all sorts of hoaxes going on with Schiff.
[00:11:49.824 --> 00:11:58.289]  Getting up in the committee and saying that Trump said, I'm not going to give you this billion dollars unless you do what I say.
[00:11:58.289 --> 00:11:58.970]  Do you understand?
[00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.171]  Don't call me.
[00:12:00.171 --> 00:12:01.011]  I'll call you.
[00:12:01.011 --> 00:12:02.312]  You'll do what I tell you.
[00:12:02.312 --> 00:12:02.932]  You understand?
[00:12:02.932 --> 00:12:07.055]  No money unless you give me the dirt on Biden.
[00:12:07.055 --> 00:12:08.616]  It was a fake transcript.
[00:12:08.616 --> 00:12:10.397]  The real transcript doesn't show that.
[00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:13.059]  And other news outlets ran with it and never retracted it.
[00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:17.325]  And then Biden comes out and says Trump's never decried white supremism.
[00:12:17.325 --> 00:12:18.285]  Total lie.
[00:12:18.285 --> 00:12:22.990]  So they've entered the zone of not just lying, but staging huge events.
[00:12:24.445 --> 00:12:26.406]  So we've got to be looking out for that.
[00:12:26.406 --> 00:12:37.329]  But what's not staged is the fact that there's a criminal investigation going on of Brennan, Clapper, Comey, McCabe, that's been reopened on Hillary.
[00:12:37.329 --> 00:12:40.971]  It's very real, and they're acting very, very scared.
[00:12:40.971 --> 00:12:47.153]  And Trump said last Friday, we're going to play the clip coming up at the bottom of the hour again, he said it's very, very serious what's happened.
[00:12:47.153 --> 00:12:48.413]  It's going to be very, very disturbing.
[00:12:48.413 --> 00:12:50.014]  It's very, very serious.
[00:12:50.014 --> 00:12:52.315]  You're not going to believe what we've caught them doing.
[00:12:52.315 --> 00:12:53.415]  And it's going to be coming out.
[00:12:54.841 --> 00:13:01.948]  Well, Trump either always gets done what he says he'll do, or they block him but he keeps trying until it happens.
[00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:06.172]  So, he's trying to get these indictments going and they should happen.
[00:13:06.172 --> 00:13:11.578]  And Comey's got his private jet, I guess, warmed up to run to New Zealand.
[00:13:11.578 --> 00:13:13.580]  He's kind of getting us all ready for that.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.382]  So a lot of crazy things going on.
[00:13:16.382 --> 00:13:18.485]  Speaking of that, here's Trump
[00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:25.634]  This morning, talking about how Schiff, the head of the House Intelligence Committee, is a criminal.
[00:13:25.634 --> 00:13:26.054]  Here it is.
[00:13:26.054 --> 00:13:32.157]  Schiff went before Congress, and Adam Schiff, what he did, will never be forgotten.
[00:13:32.157 --> 00:13:36.078]  He made up a conversation that was a phony fabrication.
[00:13:36.078 --> 00:13:37.199]  It was a fraud.
[00:13:37.199 --> 00:13:39.140]  And people shouldn't be allowed to get away.
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.102]  They say he has immunity, because he's a member of Congress.
[00:13:43.102 --> 00:13:45.042]  People shouldn't be allowed to do that.
[00:13:45.042 --> 00:13:46.063]  That's a criminal act.
[00:13:46.063 --> 00:13:47.684]  What he did is a criminal act.
[00:13:47.684 --> 00:13:48.104]  Thank you.
[00:13:49.164 --> 00:13:51.745]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, so there you go.
[00:13:51.745 --> 00:14:02.492]  When we come back, though, we're gonna dive right in to the big enchilada, and that is, did al-Baghdadi really get killed?
[00:14:02.492 --> 00:14:06.014]  And did Trump stage the Situation Room photo?
[00:14:06.014 --> 00:14:09.215]  You can see right there on screen.
[00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:11.337]  So, that's what we're talking about here.
[00:14:11.337 --> 00:14:12.457]  Did he stage it?
[00:14:12.457 --> 00:14:15.739]  Every photo is staged, if you know the photo's being taken.
[00:14:15.739 --> 00:14:17.240]  So, technically, that's the staged photo.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:25.602]  The question is, did the raid itself happen?
[00:14:25.602 --> 00:14:26.562]  Did the raid happen?
[00:14:26.562 --> 00:14:32.304]  It's completely reasonable to say it didn't happen, because we've been lied to so much.
[00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:34.405]  The media says, oh, don't question things.
[00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:36.585]  But when they want to question something, they can't.
[00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:38.686]  But did the raid happen?
[00:14:38.686 --> 00:14:40.926]  Is al-Baghdadi dead?
[00:14:40.926 --> 00:14:42.747]  And why is this so important?
[00:14:42.747 --> 00:14:45.868]  We're going to look at every angle of this.
[00:14:47.881 --> 00:14:49.062]  When we come back.
[00:14:49.062 --> 00:14:52.424]  Now, a few items here.
[00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:53.524]  Something very exciting.
[00:14:53.524 --> 00:15:02.669]  A caller called in last night, a 61-year-old Marine vet, and he talked about how sick he was at the VA for months and months, and he was going to die, they told him.
[00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:10.134]  And he kept hearing the ads on the show, and we were talking about MycoZx, we were talking about good probiotics, and we were talking about
[00:15:10.967 --> 00:15:18.355]  The different immune systems and different ways that people can protect their bodies and take care of themselves.
[00:15:18.355 --> 00:15:23.440]  And he heard us hammering on living defense.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:33.010]  It's got all these known concentrated herbs and botanicals like black walnut that's prepared properly that are known to flush parasites from the microscopic to quite large out of your body.
[00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:34.319]  I don't

[00:16:07.947 --> 00:16:11.810]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[00:17:10.204 --> 00:17:18.572]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:17:18.732 --> 00:17:28.034]  Bill Hyde here, and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX Microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[00:17:28.034 --> 00:17:33.316]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[00:17:33.316 --> 00:17:45.519]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:46.779]  So here's what you should do right now.
[00:17:46.779 --> 00:17:48.660]  Check out the PPX Microgrid system.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.020]  We're good.
[00:18:09.204 --> 00:18:11.405]  It is now an admitted fact.
[00:18:11.405 --> 00:18:18.987]  Fluoride added to the water has caused tens of millions of Americans to be brain damaged and to have infertility and low IQs.
[00:18:18.987 --> 00:18:25.128]  And it doesn't matter if the Journal of American Medical Association comes out and says it's terrible, still the city's put it in the water.
[00:18:25.128 --> 00:18:29.229]  Because the ruling globalists want you and your family poisoned and stupid.
[00:18:29.229 --> 00:18:31.930]  And they sure don't want you to know about the good allergen.
[00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:41.514]  Iodine that absolutely increases IQ and fertility and makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything.
[00:18:41.514 --> 00:18:42.454]  Thank God!

[00:18:44.755 --> 00:18:47.796]  Of course, the enemy knows all about it and they hope you don't discover it.
[00:18:47.796 --> 00:18:49.517]  They hope you just roll over and die.

[00:19:18.843 --> 00:19:22.145]  You know it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water.
[00:19:34.474 --> 00:19:34.694]  I think.
[00:19:53.439 --> 00:19:55.501]  Drink fluoride and die!
[00:19:55.501 --> 00:19:58.825]  Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over!

[00:20:21.545 --> 00:20:27.009]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:31.412]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:31.412 --> 00:20:37.077]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:48.167 --> 00:20:58.213]  It is October 28th, 2019 on this live Monday Global Edition.
[00:20:58.213 --> 00:21:01.195]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:21:01.195 --> 00:21:07.278]  And let's talk about the big front and center story right now.
[00:21:07.278 --> 00:21:08.079]  Did U.S.
[00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:11.781]  Special Forces in northern Syria kill al-Baghdadi?
[00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:13.991]  Well, let's look at the history.
[00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:14.631]  Let's look at the facts.
[00:21:14.631 --> 00:21:23.734]  Let's look at who we're hearing this from and the compendium or the continuum of Trump's mindset, Trump's behavior, and predict Trump's future actions as well.
[00:21:42.847 --> 00:21:55.152]  Trump is surrounded by deep staters looking for a crooked toenail, an I not dotted, a T not crossed.
[00:21:55.152 --> 00:22:09.598]  And so whereas you had a unified deep state with an Obama, or a Clinton, or a Bush, and they can keep their lies together at the top, you got some whistleblowers low-level that they persecuted.
[00:22:11.499 --> 00:22:17.192]  But because they had that control, they could get away with putting out giant hoaxes.
[00:22:17.192 --> 00:22:21.642]  Many of which later they got caught, but still it became the official story.
[00:22:23.168 --> 00:22:34.679]  Babies in incubators that had their brains bashed out, that launched the Gulf War I. And then nuclear reactors and mobile anthrax trucks, that launched Gulf War II.
[00:22:34.679 --> 00:22:37.322]  Gulf of Tonkin got us into Vietnam officially in 1964.
[00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:40.084]  I mean, there's a lot of examples of these.
[00:22:40.084 --> 00:22:44.529]  So it's good to question things, and it's an American's right to do it.
[00:22:45.589 --> 00:23:04.313]  I'm being sued in Texas and Connecticut by Democrat law firms who openly want to overturn the First Amendment, publicly, headed up by Senator Blumenthal, his law firm, and they say they want to end free speech for conservatives, then they misrepresent what I've said to try to then overturn the First Amendment.
[00:23:04.313 --> 00:23:10.695]  But I have a right to say the things they even say I said, though I didn't.
[00:23:10.695 --> 00:23:12.415]  Because as much as we've been lied to,
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:20.922]  It's okay when the mainstream media and the Russians question this raid.
[00:23:20.922 --> 00:23:24.163]  But, let's pull back.
[00:23:24.163 --> 00:23:26.704]  A, this raid happened.
[00:23:26.704 --> 00:23:28.764]  I'd give it about a 99% probability.
[00:23:28.764 --> 00:23:31.405]  I know Trump's been told it happened.
[00:23:31.405 --> 00:23:41.288]  And I know that if he says he saw the HD footage of it happening, he believes it happened because he would never lie like this on a scale like this
[00:23:42.403 --> 00:23:44.945]  He would want to actually kill this guy.
[00:23:44.945 --> 00:23:51.229]  Plus, he wouldn't want to be able to be blackmailed by all the deep state around him that would know it was staged and fake.
[00:23:51.229 --> 00:23:57.493]  If he took part in that, he'd know it was a setup.
[00:23:57.493 --> 00:24:02.516]  I mean, if Trump farts in the wind, it gets reported by the news.
[00:24:02.516 --> 00:24:07.500]  Everything he does gets leaked with a bunch of spin and a bunch of lies.
[00:24:08.439 --> 00:24:12.642]  Attachments why he said DC is a leaking machine.
[00:24:12.642 --> 00:24:36.619]  I didn't tell anybody in Congress about this because we know Special Forces raids before taking out Isis and Al Qaeda When the troops got there both the army and or the Navy SEALs or others they were waiting for them Well this time Trump didn't tell the Democrats because if you think they wouldn't try to have a Bay of Pigs against Trump and
[00:24:37.748 --> 00:24:41.970]  Tell the enemy that the troops were coming to embarrass Trump.
[00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:45.332]  Troops are totally expendable to the deep state, not to Trump.
[00:24:45.332 --> 00:24:52.435]  They blew up the Navy SEALs that knew that Bin Laden was not killed in that raid, but that a body double was killed.
[00:24:52.435 --> 00:24:54.256]  And because they started talking, they died.
[00:24:54.256 --> 00:24:56.437]  The biggest death of Navy SEALs ever.
[00:24:56.437 --> 00:25:00.539]  What, 23 of them on board that helicopter that had a bomb on board.
[00:25:00.539 --> 00:25:05.121]  I was told that by Navy SEALs first, two days after it happened, before it was ever in the news.
[00:25:10.933 --> 00:25:13.776]  They thought it was suspicious that all of them were being put on this one helicopter.
[00:25:13.776 --> 00:25:19.060]  They said, you're supposed to put us on a bunch of helicopters and we're not even briefed on this mission and something smells.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.482]  There was a big argument on the tarmac.
[00:25:21.482 --> 00:25:25.866]  But they followed orders and they got on that sucker that took RPG fire.
[00:25:25.866 --> 00:25:27.688]  No, it got blown up.
[00:25:27.688 --> 00:25:30.050]  There was a bomb on board.
[00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.571]  Witnesses saw that thing.
[00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:32.512]  No missile hit it.
[00:25:32.512 --> 00:25:35.415]  It just blew up with 20 plus on board.
[00:25:38.274 --> 00:25:40.056]  No protocol followed, nothing.
[00:25:40.056 --> 00:25:41.197]  Like, why are we all being put on?
[00:25:41.197 --> 00:25:42.258]  We're not being prepared.
[00:25:42.258 --> 00:25:42.959]  What's the target?
[00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:43.479]  What's going on?
[00:25:43.479 --> 00:25:45.281]  Just get on.
[00:25:45.281 --> 00:25:48.264]  Bye-bye!
[00:25:48.264 --> 00:25:54.371]  We had Dr. Steve Pachetnik, who's one of the founders of Delta Force, on in 2002 saying, he's died of Marfan's.
[00:25:54.371 --> 00:25:55.932]  Here's where he died.
[00:25:55.932 --> 00:25:57.253]  But they've got his body on ice.
[00:25:57.253 --> 00:25:58.515]  They're going to roll it out later.
[00:25:58.515 --> 00:26:01.418]  So that
[00:26:03.945 --> 00:26:11.189]  Someone can look like a hero, but then Bush didn't do it before his re-election because Walter Cronkite came out and said it, Madeleine Albright came out and said it.
[00:26:11.189 --> 00:26:17.953]  After we said it, all these top globalists came out who were fighting with Bush at the time and said, he's got the dead body, don't announce you have him.
[00:26:17.953 --> 00:26:23.296]  So they waited till later.
[00:26:23.296 --> 00:26:26.197]  So, I believe this happened.
[00:26:26.197 --> 00:26:29.679]  We know al-Baghdadi was working for the CIA and the leftists.
[00:26:29.679 --> 00:26:31.040]  We know he was protected by Hillary.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.301]  We know John McCain met with him.
[00:26:33.422 --> 00:26:39.004]  On in photos and on record and was saying he was a good guy leading Al Nusra.
[00:26:39.004 --> 00:26:41.064]  The Washington Post was praising him as a good guy.
[00:26:41.064 --> 00:26:43.605]  They've done this before.
[00:26:43.605 --> 00:26:47.706]  So we know what's going on here.
[00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:51.167]  And so he was being protected and I even talked to military folks.
[00:26:52.768 --> 00:26:56.429]  Outside of this office and inside this office that have contacts over there.
[00:26:56.429 --> 00:27:01.810]  They were mad two years ago that there was a base of ISIS Al-Qaeda being protected in the north.
[00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.010]  And that the US military was told to leave it alone.
[00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.130]  Our military was telling Trump about this.
[00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:10.331]  So he let the Turks come in, shell that quote prison.
[00:27:10.331 --> 00:27:12.952]  It was really an ISIS base.
[00:27:12.952 --> 00:27:15.172]  And then al-Baghdadi barely made it out.
[00:27:15.172 --> 00:27:19.213]  They followed him to the spider hole and killed him.
[00:27:19.213 --> 00:27:21.133]  So we have a lot of inside intel on this as well.
[00:27:22.657 --> 00:27:25.480]  Now the Russians have come out and they didn't say this didn't happen.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.021]  That's the mainstream media headline.
[00:27:27.021 --> 00:27:36.009]  They said we heard from locals conflicting stories about who actually attacked this facility and we didn't see any air bombardment beforehand and we think he may not be dead.
[00:27:36.009 --> 00:27:41.054]  That doesn't mean they're saying that Trump is lying or that it didn't happen.
[00:27:41.054 --> 00:27:44.657]  And as much lying as we've seen, that's fine for the Russian general to say.
[00:27:47.022 --> 00:27:55.664]  But Trump believes he was killed, Trump watched footage of it, and Trump is now trumping that, saying last night he'll release the footage.
[00:27:55.664 --> 00:27:58.444]  Now they're going, oh don't do that, you'll let our tactics be known.
[00:27:58.444 --> 00:28:01.845]  Give me a break.
[00:28:01.845 --> 00:28:03.025]  What, bombarding it?
[00:28:03.025 --> 00:28:08.087]  Killing everybody above ground and then sending people into the underground holes to kill them?
[00:28:08.087 --> 00:28:09.007]  Sending dogs in?
[00:28:09.007 --> 00:28:10.127]  Everybody knows those techniques.
[00:28:13.888 --> 00:28:19.452]  I would have just thrown hand grenades down there or flamethrowed the whole deal, but they, quote, want to get the guy alive.
[00:28:19.452 --> 00:28:21.993]  He supposedly blew up himself with the children.
[00:28:21.993 --> 00:28:23.794]  Well, I want to see all that footage.
[00:28:23.794 --> 00:28:24.755]  Let's see it.
[00:28:24.755 --> 00:28:25.816]  Oh, it's too gruesome.
[00:28:25.816 --> 00:28:28.517]  Bull.
[00:28:28.517 --> 00:28:29.138]  Let's see it.
[00:28:29.138 --> 00:28:30.078]  Let's have it released.
[00:28:30.078 --> 00:28:30.779]  I agree.
[00:28:30.779 --> 00:28:31.820]  They're fighting Trump on that.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.761]  So Trump is countering them saying, well, we'll release the footage.
[00:28:34.761 --> 00:28:37.623]  And you know, they've got the HD footage recorded.
[00:28:37.623 --> 00:28:40.525]  You know, they had a sat connection transmitting the footage out.
[00:28:40.525 --> 00:28:41.406]  Probably wasn't HD.
[00:28:41.406 --> 00:28:43.207]  But Trump said it looked like a movie.
[00:28:46.906 --> 00:28:54.989]  Now there is a very slight chance, because they did this on some of the raids in Baghdad, remember, with G.I.
[00:28:54.989 --> 00:29:03.412]  Jane and the rest of it, that they could shoot the whole thing and that that could have been fake and they showed the President that.
[00:29:03.412 --> 00:29:05.773]  That's been done before, but I doubt it.
[00:29:05.773 --> 00:29:06.993]  Trump is the real deal.
[00:29:08.254 --> 00:29:10.215]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:15.517]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:15.517 --> 00:29:17.097]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:17.097 --> 00:29:25.461]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:25.461 --> 00:29:31.143]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:31.323 --> 00:29:33.145]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:33.145 --> 00:29:35.288]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:35.288 --> 00:29:39.814]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:39.814 --> 00:29:42.017]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:29:42.017 --> 00:29:49.767]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:30:08.919 --> 00:30:14.463]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[00:30:14.463 --> 00:30:17.485]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[00:30:17.485 --> 00:30:21.909]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:28.514]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[00:30:28.974 --> 00:30:34.977]  They might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[00:30:34.977 --> 00:30:40.359]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[00:30:40.359 --> 00:30:47.943]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[00:30:48.123 --> 00:30:49.023]  It's that simple.
[00:30:49.023 --> 00:30:55.226]  Find out about the Iodine Conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[00:30:55.226 --> 00:30:59.008]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research Iodine Deficiency.
[00:30:59.008 --> 00:31:00.949]  It's the key to everything.
[00:31:00.949 --> 00:31:10.473]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality Iodine and BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[00:31:10.473 --> 00:31:12.214]  Here are the facts.
[00:31:13.502 --> 00:31:22.585]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies including the American Medical Journal.
[00:31:22.585 --> 00:31:29.007]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility.
[00:31:29.007 --> 00:31:30.027]  That's the facts.
[00:31:30.307 --> 00:31:36.310]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy and then once you've learned about it, protect yourself and your family.
[00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:42.433]  The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine.
[00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:48.016]  In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people under their control.
[00:31:48.456 --> 00:31:50.597]  The globalists are targeting us here.
[00:31:50.597 --> 00:31:52.537]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:52.537 --> 00:31:56.338]  Experience iodine and biotruth selenium that goes with it together.
[00:31:56.338 --> 00:31:59.059]  And then once you see the great results, warn others.
[00:31:59.059 --> 00:32:01.160]  This is the Achilles heel of the globalists.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.400]  It's a win-win situation.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.141]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[00:32:04.141 --> 00:32:04.761]  Take action now.
[00:32:09.264 --> 00:32:11.385]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[00:32:11.385 --> 00:32:14.167]  I'm Wilbur Snakeland.
[00:32:14.167 --> 00:32:35.860]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro to the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[00:32:36.901 --> 00:32:48.855]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice, telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential, and how fluoride's bad.
[00:32:48.855 --> 00:32:52.199]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[00:32:52.199 --> 00:32:54.121]  There's no medical journals, there's no facts.
[00:32:54.862 --> 00:32:56.323]  You need fluoride.
[00:32:56.323 --> 00:33:11.387]  Just drink extra fluoride and then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[00:33:11.387 --> 00:33:14.028]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.042 --> 00:33:33.544]  I'm going to break down there in a moment strategically why taking out al-Baghdadi is so critical, why it is such a big victory, and why the whole system is trying to spin it and demonize it.
[00:33:34.887 --> 00:33:43.169]  But remember, the big issue is that the criminal investigations are ongoing, have been ongoing for several years, and are about to start going public.
[00:33:43.169 --> 00:33:48.610]  That's confirmed against the deep state, and that's why they're so dangerous right now.
[00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:50.131]  We cannot be overconfident.
[00:33:50.131 --> 00:33:51.871]  We've got to stay frosty.
[00:33:51.871 --> 00:33:54.492]  Here's the president talking about how serious these crimes are.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:03.567]  As you know, there's been a long-term look at, look-see, and it looks like it's becoming very serious from what I'm hearing.
[00:34:03.567 --> 00:34:06.270]  Investigate the investigators.
[00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:12.996]  Whether it's Strzok and Page, whether it's Clapper, and whether it's Comey, and all of these people.
[00:34:13.976 --> 00:34:16.900]  Because terrible things went on for our country.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:24.710]  And we have a great Attorney General, highly prestigious man, a very honorable man, and they've been looking at her for a long time.
[00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:26.953]  I can't tell you what's happening.
[00:34:26.953 --> 00:34:27.794]  I will tell you this.
[00:34:28.866 --> 00:34:31.048]  I think you're going to see a lot of really bad things.
[00:34:31.048 --> 00:34:38.054]  And a lot of people think that, and they know they have problems, because they were very dishonest.
[00:34:38.054 --> 00:34:47.262]  And again, I leave it all up to the Attorney General, and I leave it all up to the people that are working with the Attorney General, who I don't know.
[00:34:47.262 --> 00:34:50.365]  But I will say this, I think you'll see things that nobody would have believed.
[00:34:54.116 --> 00:34:56.918]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:34:56.918 --> 00:34:57.159]  I think.
[00:34:57.159 --> 00:34:57.839]  Just let me think.
[00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:03.664]  I suspect even now orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:35:03.664 --> 00:35:05.025]  It's Chancellor Settler.
[00:35:05.025 --> 00:35:05.705]  Damn it!
[00:35:05.705 --> 00:35:06.786]  Why?
[00:35:06.786 --> 00:35:13.372]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:35:13.372 --> 00:35:16.354]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[00:35:19.302 --> 00:35:24.144]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:35:24.144 --> 00:35:25.185]  You designed it, sir.
[00:35:25.185 --> 00:35:26.125]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:35:26.125 --> 00:35:27.766]  You taught me every television in London.
[00:35:27.766 --> 00:35:29.887]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:35:29.887 --> 00:35:31.667]  Intolerance and depression.
[00:35:31.667 --> 00:35:41.331]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and suppressing your submission.
[00:35:41.331 --> 00:35:41.511]  Cameras.
[00:35:41.511 --> 00:35:42.532]  We need cameras.
[00:35:42.532 --> 00:35:43.952]  How did this happen?
[00:35:43.952 --> 00:35:44.733]  Who's to blame?
[00:35:45.713 --> 00:35:48.376]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:35:48.376 --> 00:35:50.298]  They will be held accountable.
[00:35:50.298 --> 00:35:56.165]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:35:57.367 --> 00:35:59.349]  I know why you did it.
[00:35:59.349 --> 00:36:00.449]  I know you were afraid.
[00:36:00.449 --> 00:36:02.091]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:36:02.091 --> 00:36:02.851]  War?
[00:36:02.851 --> 00:36:03.492]  Terror?
[00:36:03.492 --> 00:36:04.793]  Disease?
[00:36:04.793 --> 00:36:11.218]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:36:11.218 --> 00:36:17.623]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:36:17.623 --> 00:36:23.787]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:36:30.498 --> 00:36:32.179]  There is a war.
[00:36:32.179 --> 00:36:34.061]  It's happening now.
[00:36:34.061 --> 00:36:36.423]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:36:36.423 --> 00:36:38.985]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:36:38.985 --> 00:36:40.926]  We are the resistance.
[00:36:40.926 --> 00:36:50.114]  We are the Infowar.
[00:36:50.114 --> 00:36:52.616]  The quickening is here.
[00:36:52.616 --> 00:36:57.560]  No one can make any doubt about that, and I'm going to open the phones up, as I did yesterday,
[00:36:58.487 --> 00:37:08.574]  In the second and third hour, we had amazing calls yesterday, as we did first-time callers, and that gave folks a chance who've been unable to get in on air a chance.
[00:37:08.574 --> 00:37:10.615]  I had three people left on hold at the end of the show.
[00:37:10.615 --> 00:37:11.956]  We have their names and numbers in there.
[00:37:11.956 --> 00:37:17.719]  I'm going to try to call them first and get them on if they're able to make a call during the weekdays.
[00:37:17.719 --> 00:37:19.681]  We have the Sunday show, of course, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:37:19.681 --> 00:37:22.342]  I've been doing that show now for 12 years.
[00:37:22.342 --> 00:37:23.603]  I've been doing this show for 22 years.
[00:37:25.475 --> 00:37:32.400]  Then on air for 25 time is certainly flying.
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.523]  I want to get back into the raid, and you're welcome to call in about that.
[00:37:36.523 --> 00:37:39.385]  You're welcome to call in about the move to impeach.
[00:37:39.385 --> 00:37:42.287]  You're welcome to call in about the private Federal Reserve trying to plunge the economy.
[00:37:42.287 --> 00:37:46.369]  You're welcome to call in about anything you want to cover, really.
[00:37:46.369 --> 00:37:48.631]  It'll be open phones as long as you're a first-time caller.
[00:37:53.407 --> 00:37:56.828]  And how do you think the deep state's gonna keep trying to strike back?
[00:37:56.828 --> 00:38:00.969]  We know with just huge hoaxes.
[00:38:00.969 --> 00:38:08.412]  But I'll tell you this about the situation with Trump and the Al-Baghdadi raid.
[00:38:08.412 --> 00:38:18.855]  If I went through every piece of evidence and every piece of background info that I know about this, it would take me probably 10 hours to lay out each piece of evidence.
[00:38:20.103 --> 00:38:21.603]  It's knowledge.
[00:38:21.603 --> 00:38:36.067]  I know you out there have a lot of that same knowledge, in some cases more than I do, but you got to know how Hillary and Obama set up the Arab Spring almost nine years ago now, a couple years into their administration.
[00:38:36.067 --> 00:38:49.350]  And you got to know how they had a different group in Saudi Arabia that they had an alliance with that was running the Wahhabist terror systems that you know as Al Qaeda.
[00:38:50.316 --> 00:38:54.400]  Al-Nusra, and then of course their state is Islamic State.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:06.650]  And the fact that they were brought into Syria, and brought into Libya, and protected, and allowed to put blacks back into slavery in North Africa, and kick women out of college, and throw gays off buildings.
[00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:11.154]  I mean, we all know what Obama and Hillary did with that faction in Saudi Arabia.
[00:39:12.805 --> 00:39:20.708]  Trump got in, turned it around, really knocked some heads, worked with a faction in Saudi Arabia to kill.
[00:39:20.708 --> 00:39:25.230]  They probably killed at least 10,000 people.
[00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:30.071]  Ran a big hotel, torturing people, hanging them up by their feet.
[00:39:30.071 --> 00:39:31.492]  I mean, I don't really condone all that.
[00:39:31.492 --> 00:39:32.472]  That's what the Saudis do.
[00:39:32.472 --> 00:39:36.354]  But Trump told them, you do this or I'm going to overthrow your whole government.
[00:39:36.354 --> 00:39:39.395]  No more games after the Saudis staged Vegas.
[00:39:41.601 --> 00:39:45.304]  That's just the way the real world works, folks.
[00:39:45.304 --> 00:39:46.684]  And all of that's confirmed.
[00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:53.649]  So, Trump has kicked the Saudis out that the deep state was telling what to do, the globalists.
[00:39:53.649 --> 00:39:55.530]  And he said, we're going to have peace in the Middle East.
[00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.893]  We're not going to have the strategy of tension, stirring up trouble, destabilizing things anymore.
[00:39:59.893 --> 00:40:00.954]  You do that, it's over.
[00:40:00.954 --> 00:40:05.837]  Oh, and by the way, we didn't take Iraq over in 91 in 2003 to give all the oil to China.
[00:40:09.585 --> 00:40:10.865]  We're taking it.
[00:40:10.865 --> 00:40:12.866]  See, you always heard we went there for oil.
[00:40:12.866 --> 00:40:14.026]  No, we went there for globalism.
[00:40:14.026 --> 00:40:17.547]  It's like we went to Afghanistan to secure the rare earth minerals for China.
[00:40:17.547 --> 00:40:19.588]  They've not spent $1 on security.
[00:40:19.588 --> 00:40:21.828]  We've spent a trillion for them.
[00:40:21.828 --> 00:40:23.569]  Trump's like, we're not doing this anymore.
[00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:24.989]  By the way, the oil's ours.
[00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:30.251]  I mean, you want to really get down to brass tacks, Trump's like, the local governments get it.
[00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:32.531]  You can put out the bid for the highest level.
[00:40:32.531 --> 00:40:36.753]  And by the way, you're going to pay us if we're going to be here to provide security and we deserve the first bid.
[00:40:36.753 --> 00:40:38.133]  That's good, what Trump's doing.
[00:40:39.485 --> 00:40:40.946]  He was against the first Gulf War.
[00:40:40.946 --> 00:40:41.927]  He was against the second.
[00:40:41.927 --> 00:40:43.428]  Media always said, no he's not.
[00:40:43.428 --> 00:40:47.691]  I went and found the clips on CNN and local New York News.
[00:40:47.691 --> 00:40:52.194]  He was against the first one, and he was against the second one.
[00:40:52.194 --> 00:40:56.697]  I've played those clips many times.
[00:40:56.697 --> 00:41:02.001]  And so, the Kurds have been wanting an area between Iraq and northern Syria for a hundred years.
[00:41:02.001 --> 00:41:03.442]  A little bit longer.
[00:41:04.158 --> 00:41:07.321]  They've been fighting the Ottoman Empire for that 100 years ago.
[00:41:07.321 --> 00:41:08.341]  That's where Turkey is today.
[00:41:08.341 --> 00:41:10.683]  Ottoman Empire was based there.
[00:41:10.683 --> 00:41:15.127]  Since they took over Constantinople, sacked it, took it from Christendom and the Eastern Roman Empire.
[00:41:15.127 --> 00:41:16.608]  But see, that's all history.
[00:41:16.608 --> 00:41:20.251]  And the closest thing to a crystal ball is knowing real history.
[00:41:20.251 --> 00:41:26.456]  Because it just repeats over and over again and how it all interchanges and how everything that's ancient is like waves coming into the beach.
[00:41:26.456 --> 00:41:27.377]  It's part of the same ocean.
[00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:32.153]  It's an electrical connection to everything that's already taken place.
[00:41:32.153 --> 00:41:33.374]  It's simply amazing.
[00:41:33.374 --> 00:41:36.956]  But I digress.
[00:41:36.956 --> 00:41:40.059]  Everything Trump's doing is being watched, plus he's a straight shooter.
[00:41:40.059 --> 00:41:41.019]  He wants that guy dead.
[00:41:41.019 --> 00:41:43.481]  He wants to end it.
[00:41:43.481 --> 00:41:48.424]  And it was being protected by globalists still in our military, and they had a base there.
[00:41:48.424 --> 00:41:49.385]  It wasn't a camp.
[00:41:49.385 --> 00:41:51.026]  It wasn't a prison camp.
[00:41:51.026 --> 00:41:53.708]  It was their base.
[00:41:53.708 --> 00:41:55.249]  And so Trump let the Kurds come in.
[00:41:56.718 --> 00:41:56.998]  We're good.
[00:42:27.344 --> 00:42:29.185]  Again, did Obama stage fake raids?
[00:42:29.185 --> 00:42:30.767]  Absolutely.
[00:42:30.767 --> 00:42:39.013]  Trump's not staging fake stuff, because that's not his style, and he knows that that would be leaked out immediately.
[00:42:39.013 --> 00:42:42.516]  So the media has to go, oh, he staged his photo op.
[00:42:42.516 --> 00:42:46.018]  Well, not exactly, because you see, people are looking different directions.
[00:42:46.018 --> 00:42:48.060]  Some are looking off the side, Pence is.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:52.343]  Secretary of Defense is looking at the screen.
[00:42:52.343 --> 00:42:53.964]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is looking right at the camera.
[00:42:53.964 --> 00:42:55.666]  Trump's looking at the screen.
[00:42:55.666 --> 00:42:56.667]  To say it's staged,
[00:42:57.739 --> 00:43:00.841]  Everything, all photos are staged, unless you don't know you're having a photo taken.
[00:43:00.841 --> 00:43:02.462]  That's all they've got, folks.
[00:43:02.462 --> 00:43:04.323]  No, Trump's the real deal.
[00:43:04.323 --> 00:43:05.984]  The globalist stage stuff.
[00:43:05.984 --> 00:43:06.844]  Trump delivers.
[00:43:06.844 --> 00:43:07.705]  He's a straight shooter.
[00:43:07.705 --> 00:43:10.106]  Hello today on All Things Considered.
[00:43:10.106 --> 00:43:19.632]  I'm Wilbur Snakely, here to tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[00:43:19.632 --> 00:43:23.434]  Now sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that
[00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:29.700]  It's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:30.621]  That's right.
[00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:32.482]  Drink the fluoride.
[00:43:32.482 --> 00:43:36.847]  Don't visit Infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen.
[00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:38.288]  I mean the bad halogen.
[00:43:38.288 --> 00:43:39.009]  Iodine.
[00:43:39.009 --> 00:43:42.532]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[00:43:42.532 --> 00:43:47.257]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience.
[00:43:47.997 --> 00:43:50.640]  To us, we don't want to compete with you.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.283]  Just drink the fluoride.
[00:43:53.283 --> 00:43:59.210]  Don't learn about how deadly it is, and whatever you do, don't support Alex Jones.
[00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:03.655]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm liberal.
[00:44:03.655 --> 00:44:06.158]  Oh, and let Nambla have access to your children, huh?
[00:44:08.067 --> 00:44:19.277]  Again, I'm not talking down to the InfoWars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride, and I'm talking about iodine.
[00:44:19.277 --> 00:44:29.406]  Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an old Glastron boat, and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[00:44:29.406 --> 00:44:31.728]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live.
[00:44:32.717 --> 00:44:34.279]  Okay, it's the same thing.
[00:44:34.279 --> 00:44:37.343]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride.
[00:44:37.343 --> 00:44:40.207]  That's why in every western nation they put it in the water.
[00:44:40.207 --> 00:44:42.350]  They're going to teach us Christians to lay down and die.
[00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.172]  The Chai Kams don't put it in the water.
[00:44:44.172 --> 00:44:45.694]  They'd execute you if you did that.
[00:44:45.694 --> 00:44:47.637]  They put iodine in the water because
[00:44:47.637 --> 00:44:53.660]  Because it's the good allergen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else.
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:57.582]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:44:57.582 --> 00:44:59.523]  We have all the documents and articles linked.
[00:44:59.523 --> 00:45:03.905]  And then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[00:45:03.905 --> 00:45:06.526]  Again, get iodine at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:09.108 --> 00:45:13.171]  InfoWars presents Alex Jones.
[00:45:13.171 --> 00:45:27.960]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious, came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies die in the womb, and it causes cancer.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.522]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[00:45:31.042 --> 00:45:37.907]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[00:45:37.907 --> 00:45:46.834]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children.
[00:45:46.834 --> 00:45:52.358]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:45:53.439 --> 00:45:55.481]  Drink fluoride and die!
[00:45:55.481 --> 00:45:58.804]  Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over!
[00:45:58.804 --> 00:46:02.328]  Do not visit InfoWarsTore.com and get high poly iodine to counter it.
[00:46:02.328 --> 00:46:02.668]  No!
[00:46:02.668 --> 00:46:04.630]  Roll over and die, dirty Americans!
[00:46:10.791 --> 00:46:14.515]  Hello here, my name is Bethelmed.
[00:46:14.515 --> 00:46:26.986]  I work for my father, Lucifer, and he doesn't like the fact that God gave you all families and children, and so we want to tell you something right now, Christian countries.
[00:46:26.986 --> 00:46:29.429]  We took control of you over a hundred years ago.
[00:46:29.429 --> 00:46:34.454]  We've been spiking your water with fluoride to lower your fertility and to hurt you.
[00:46:35.314 --> 00:46:46.748]  And it's worked so well, but now because of liability, and because of people warning inside the government what's happening, the Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done.
[00:46:46.748 --> 00:46:52.856]  And it makes me so angry, so whatever you do, just stay in that haze, and drink fluoride and give it to your children.
[00:46:55.097 --> 00:47:04.644]  And go visit InfoWarsTore.com and learn about the iodine conspiracy and get 60% off on X2 and X3 together with bio-proof selenium from the mustard seed.
[00:47:04.644 --> 00:47:07.166]  Submit to us!
[00:47:07.166 --> 00:47:12.430]  InfoWarsTore.com!
[00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:15.132]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:29.943 --> 00:47:32.605]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:32.605 --> 00:47:39.029]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:47:39.029 --> 00:47:43.832]  Well, one thing's for sure, this is certainly not a boring time to be alive.
[00:47:43.832 --> 00:47:46.594]  A lot of things are happening.
[00:47:46.594 --> 00:47:48.436]  A lot of change is going on.
[00:47:48.436 --> 00:47:51.938]  California is literally hell.
[00:47:51.938 --> 00:47:56.041]  And I've been saying that for many years.
[00:47:56.041 --> 00:47:59.163]  Well, now even mainstream news is saying California is hell.
[00:48:00.367 --> 00:48:02.849]  Ash is raining down over most of it.
[00:48:02.849 --> 00:48:04.451]  Large parts of the state are on fire.
[00:48:04.451 --> 00:48:06.112]  Earthquakes every day.
[00:48:06.112 --> 00:48:07.894]  Needles and human feces everywhere.
[00:48:07.894 --> 00:48:15.340]  And there's so many beautiful areas of California, but then right next to it is hell.
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.622]  In fact, I hadn't looked at drudge in a few hours.
[00:48:17.622 --> 00:48:18.503]  Cali burning.
[00:48:18.503 --> 00:48:20.125]  Hell on 405.
[00:48:20.125 --> 00:48:21.526]  Everybody's saying, hell, hell, hell.
[00:48:28.541 --> 00:48:32.923]  We're going to be showing some of those videos and going over that some in the next hour.
[00:48:32.923 --> 00:48:34.623]  We're also going to be taking your phone calls.
[00:48:34.623 --> 00:48:39.945]  But I'm going to give that number out at the start of the next hour so you don't have to sit on hold.
[00:48:39.945 --> 00:48:45.147]  And then, it's not been a secret that Communist China sells political dissidents organs.
[00:48:45.147 --> 00:48:54.550]  In fact, it's in brochures going back over two decades that the Chinese government advertises they have the freshest organs.
[00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:56.051]  Translates out of English, freshest.
[00:48:57.515 --> 00:48:59.976]  And most of the surgeries don't happen in China.
[00:48:59.976 --> 00:49:02.937]  They fly them into Japan.
[00:49:02.937 --> 00:49:07.458]  The organs, just a 30-minute flight, and then you get your fresh organs.
[00:49:07.458 --> 00:49:11.819]  Fox News, though, hats off to them, has done a big report on this.
[00:49:11.819 --> 00:49:14.880]  We're going to be airing it at the start of the next hour.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:18.582]  And then I'm going to tie it into the mobile execution vans and some of the history of this.
[00:49:18.582 --> 00:49:19.622]  And this is how we stop it.
[00:49:20.464 --> 00:49:21.285]  is exposing him.
[00:49:21.285 --> 00:49:33.053]  This is who the left says is our moral superior to the Washington Post says, you know, they hope Xi Jinping can, quote, destroy Trump to, quote, save America.
[00:49:33.053 --> 00:49:39.678]  Again, if Hitler's got one championship belt for mass murder, China's got five.
[00:49:39.678 --> 00:49:41.780]  It's unbelievable.
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.621]  So that's coming up.
[00:49:43.621 --> 00:49:44.502]  And so much more.
[00:49:44.502 --> 00:49:45.843]  And I didn't get to this yesterday.
[00:49:45.843 --> 00:49:48.585]  George Soros has topped himself in the New York Times.
[00:49:51.161 --> 00:49:57.422]  He actually says, I'm going to bend God's will to mine.
[00:49:57.422 --> 00:49:58.162]  Whoa!
[00:49:58.162 --> 00:49:59.703]  You talk about a satanist, man.
[00:49:59.703 --> 00:50:02.283]  That is a satanic statement.
[00:50:02.283 --> 00:50:04.944]  And that's a statement asking for it as well.
[00:50:04.944 --> 00:50:08.964]  But that's the nature of these little fork-tailed guys.
[00:50:08.964 --> 00:50:10.425]  And so you got to hand it to them.
[00:50:10.425 --> 00:50:13.285]  I'm going to be getting to that as well.
[00:50:13.285 --> 00:50:16.506]  Can you imagine being that delusional?
[00:50:17.466 --> 00:50:19.007]  The bad luck of saying something like that.
[00:50:19.007 --> 00:50:21.770]  I'm like even repeating what he just said.
[00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:24.572]  But live long and prosper there, buddy.
[00:50:24.572 --> 00:50:26.434]  So we're going to be breaking all that down.
[00:50:26.434 --> 00:50:37.023]  I want to get more into this Baghdadi raid and how the media has been demonizing Trump.
[00:50:38.488 --> 00:50:44.771]  And just how pathetic it is, and how if Trump came out with a cure for cancer, they'd say, yeah, that's going to lay doctors off.
[00:50:44.771 --> 00:50:50.815]  But first, we had a caller yesterday talk about this product, and we sold a third of it off the shelves.
[00:50:50.815 --> 00:50:53.816]  We don't have more of this coming in until four months into next year.
[00:50:53.816 --> 00:50:55.157]  Living defense.
[00:50:55.157 --> 00:50:56.578]  Here's what the caller had to say.
[00:50:56.578 --> 00:51:06.583]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[00:51:07.108 --> 00:51:08.149]  Hey, Alex!
[00:51:08.149 --> 00:51:09.510]  Oh my God!
[00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:12.493]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[00:51:12.493 --> 00:51:17.398]  Alex, I gotta tell you, man, I don't care what anybody has ever said about you.
[00:51:17.398 --> 00:51:23.704]  You have re-appealed more human beings than anybody on planet Earth, and God bless you.
[00:51:23.704 --> 00:51:25.966]  Everything you stand for, everything you've done,
[00:51:27.052 --> 00:51:28.432]  You are the best, man.
[00:51:28.432 --> 00:51:30.173]  I mean, it's the absolute truth.
[00:51:30.173 --> 00:51:35.654]  And when I heard you today with this live call, and you encouraged people to call in, I said, that's it, man.
[00:51:35.654 --> 00:51:36.574]  I'm just going to break down.
[00:51:36.574 --> 00:51:39.955]  I got to tell you, look, in January 2016, I went in the hospital.
[00:51:39.955 --> 00:51:44.096]  I went in the VA hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[00:51:44.096 --> 00:51:48.517]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to InfoWars
[00:51:49.378 --> 00:51:55.740]  Every day for three hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.240]  Let me tell you something, man.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:04.702]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[00:52:04.702 --> 00:52:06.462]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[00:52:06.462 --> 00:52:10.463]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[00:52:10.463 --> 00:52:13.064]  I'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense.
[00:52:13.064 --> 00:52:16.085]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff.
[00:52:16.505 --> 00:52:18.386]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[00:52:18.386 --> 00:52:18.927]  I got it.
[00:52:18.927 --> 00:52:20.488]  I hid it from the nurses.
[00:52:20.488 --> 00:52:21.528]  I started taking it.
[00:52:21.528 --> 00:52:23.950]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:25.211]  It saved my life.
[00:52:25.211 --> 00:52:28.113]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[00:52:28.113 --> 00:52:38.739]  Listen, man, if there's any veteran out there, I don't care if you've traveled, anybody's traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that Living Defense.
[00:52:38.739 --> 00:52:39.440]  It's true, folks.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:42.482]  We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality.
[00:52:42.482 --> 00:52:44.083]  And Living Defense is over-the-top good.
[00:52:44.463 --> 00:52:45.803]  We're not making this up.
[00:52:45.803 --> 00:52:54.625]  Just like our information is game-changing, the products are game-changing.
[00:52:54.625 --> 00:53:11.529]  And ladies and gentlemen, even though I could sell this over the next four months for $39.95, it's retail because it costs well over $10 a bottle, I'm selling it for $19.95 right now until it sells out because I want you to experience it.
[00:53:11.529 --> 00:53:12.709]  And once it works great for you,
[00:53:13.988 --> 00:53:15.509]  Well, then I want you to tell other people about it.
[00:53:15.509 --> 00:53:16.909]  That's how this works.
[00:53:16.909 --> 00:53:18.009]  Living defense.
[00:53:18.009 --> 00:53:20.030]  Look at that big old giant bottle.
[00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:22.431]  I mean, it's jam-packed in there.
[00:53:22.431 --> 00:53:26.573]  And you take a regimen of this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:26.573 --> 00:53:28.453]  And most people have issues.
[00:53:28.453 --> 00:53:29.454]  And then it really helps them.
[00:53:29.454 --> 00:53:32.575]  If you don't, well, that means that you were parasite-free.
[00:53:32.575 --> 00:53:35.016]  This gets down to the microscopic, right up to the big old buggers.
[00:53:35.016 --> 00:53:38.437]  All right, let's go to the media demonizing Trump.
[00:53:40.211 --> 00:53:47.455]  For having the military kill Baghdadi and bringing peace to Syria to a great extent, because they don't want peace to break out.
[00:53:47.455 --> 00:53:49.817]  Here's just part of what they were saying.
[00:53:49.817 --> 00:53:54.559]  Not wanting to go through the main door because that was booby-trapped.
[00:53:54.559 --> 00:53:59.042]  And there was something, it was something really amazing to see.
[00:53:59.042 --> 00:54:07.307]  I got to watch it along with General Milley, Vice President Pence, others in the Situation Room.
[00:54:08.447 --> 00:54:11.993]  And we watched it so clearly.
[00:54:11.993 --> 00:54:19.047]  Well, I don't want to say how, but we had absolutely perfect, as though you were watching a movie.
[00:54:20.063 --> 00:54:24.565]  It was, that and the technology there alone is really great.
[00:54:24.565 --> 00:54:35.751]  It bothered me a little bit, some of what the President did in providing detail about taking back to the United States pieces of Baghdadi's body.
[00:54:35.751 --> 00:54:41.954]  It bothered me a little bit hearing the President talk about that, some of that Syrian oil being ours, right?
[00:54:41.954 --> 00:54:46.736]  Because that's what inspires, that's what inspires some extremists.
[00:54:47.338 --> 00:54:56.541]  I wonder here if this type of killing only reinforces the ideology of Baghdadi's followers.
[00:54:56.541 --> 00:54:58.542]  And in fact strengthens it.
[00:54:58.542 --> 00:55:03.684]  My understanding, interestingly enough, is that... Look, he's with the jihadi right there.
[00:55:03.684 --> 00:55:08.365]  My understanding is this woman's next to him, he says Israel shouldn't exist.
[00:55:08.365 --> 00:55:13.087]  And as we know, Trump has turned his back and betrayed the Kurds.
[00:55:13.783 --> 00:55:22.992]  Samantha, overnight, this news of the raid, the President obviously speaking at great length, sharing incredible detail about this mission in Syria.
[00:55:22.992 --> 00:55:23.673]  What strikes you?
[00:55:23.673 --> 00:55:24.874]  What stands out to you?
[00:55:24.874 --> 00:55:33.822]  Well, this is obviously a major accomplishment, but from a counterterrorism perspective, the President's engagement with the media on this, Brian, is pretty surprising to me.
[00:55:33.822 --> 00:55:35.004]  This is a high-risk period.
[00:55:35.544 --> 00:55:43.746]  Immediately after a special operation like this, there is increased risk of retaliatory attacks and risk to human sources on the ground in Syria, for example.
[00:55:43.746 --> 00:55:51.308]  The level of detail that President Trump went into in that press conference increases the risk to sources that may still be on the ground.
[00:55:51.308 --> 00:55:55.509]  It's really unprecedented when you think about how much detail he actually went into.
[00:55:55.509 --> 00:55:57.069]  Are you saying it's irresponsible?
[00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:58.409]  I think it is irresponsible.
[00:55:58.409 --> 00:56:00.010]  I think it puts sources at risk.
[00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:00.670]  You know, let's just stop.
[00:56:02.017 --> 00:56:03.218]  I played a lot of this last night.
[00:56:03.218 --> 00:56:03.979]  I can't listen anymore.
[00:56:03.979 --> 00:56:07.021]  There's like three more minutes of it.
[00:56:07.021 --> 00:56:08.602]  There's even more today.
[00:56:08.602 --> 00:56:10.504]  You've all seen it.
[00:56:10.504 --> 00:56:17.770]  Obama started the Arab Spring and overthrew our allies in Egypt and other areas and put the worst people in charge.
[00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:21.333]  He worked with his cousin, Odinga, to try to overthrow Kenya.
[00:56:21.333 --> 00:56:25.556]  And those guys are connected, of course, to the attacks on the shopping malls and the rest of it.
[00:56:25.556 --> 00:56:28.118]  I mean, it's incredible how criminal Obama was.
[00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:30.700]  And Hillary was involved in Benghazi and getting the weapons in.
[00:56:31.738 --> 00:56:34.759]  To Syria, that's what that was all about.
[00:56:34.759 --> 00:56:36.400]  And covering that up.
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:41.602]  We first broke all that and then Obama grandstanded over the Bin Laden thing that was totally phony.
[00:56:41.602 --> 00:56:45.544]  So they had to kill the largest number of Navy SEALs ever killed, 23 at one time.
[00:56:45.544 --> 00:56:47.365]  Remember?
[00:56:47.365 --> 00:56:48.125]  On that helicopter.
[00:56:48.125 --> 00:56:48.806]  They were ordered on it.
[00:56:48.806 --> 00:56:49.706]  They said, is this a setup?
[00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:50.727]  They're like, bye bye!
[00:56:50.727 --> 00:56:52.167]  Blew the helicopter up.
[00:56:52.167 --> 00:56:54.628]  Because they know they killed a body double.
[00:56:54.628 --> 00:56:57.189]  And they noticed it.
[00:56:57.189 --> 00:56:58.430]  They figured it out.
[00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:59.570]  They didn't play along with it.
[00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:00.391]  So they had to die.
[00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:07.794]  Now if you see a helicopter with all the people that did this raid blow up, then things are getting suspicious.
[00:57:07.794 --> 00:57:10.096]  But that's not Trump's style, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:10.096 --> 00:57:11.437]  He doesn't stage things.
[00:57:11.437 --> 00:57:17.163]  And he knows if he tried to stage something, all his enemies around him would release the info.
[00:57:17.163 --> 00:57:18.304]  He'd be compromised like that.
[00:57:18.304 --> 00:57:27.152]  That's why this fits into Trump trying to shut down the war, trying to make a deal with all the different factions, and now the Kurds have their homeland.
[00:57:28.263 --> 00:57:38.166]  And now Turkey has got its bumper zone, and then most of Syria's intact, when the globalist plan was to break the country in three whole big parts, and give Islamic State a place to operate out of.
[00:57:38.166 --> 00:57:55.131]  No, that globalist plan failed, and better parts of our Pentagon that are not evil were the ones eight years ago that blew the whistle on Obama and Hillary, and how evil their plan was and said no, so our whole government isn't evil, and that part of the government's been working with the American people to get Trump in, and restore the country, and to stand up to the shycoms.
[00:57:55.131 --> 00:57:55.891]  That's exciting!
[00:57:57.884 --> 00:57:58.905]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[00:57:58.905 --> 00:58:00.005]  Hey Alex!
[00:58:00.005 --> 00:58:01.346]  Oh my God!
[00:58:01.346 --> 00:58:04.148]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[00:58:04.148 --> 00:58:06.770]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:10.593]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June.
[00:58:10.593 --> 00:58:14.235]  And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[00:58:14.235 --> 00:58:15.056]  Let me tell you something, man.
[00:58:15.616 --> 00:58:23.041]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[00:58:23.041 --> 00:58:24.802]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[00:58:24.802 --> 00:58:28.765]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[00:58:28.765 --> 00:58:31.147]  I'm gonna get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[00:58:31.147 --> 00:58:33.909]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritions because they don't want you to have it.
[00:58:34.329 --> 00:58:36.190]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.730]  I got it.
[00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:38.090]  I hid it from the nurses.
[00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:39.151]  I started taking it.
[00:58:39.151 --> 00:58:41.571]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[00:58:41.571 --> 00:58:42.592]  It saved my life.
[00:58:42.592 --> 00:58:52.075]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't care if you've traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that Living Defense.
[00:58:52.075 --> 00:58:52.775]  It's true, folks.
[00:58:52.775 --> 00:58:55.816]  We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality.
[00:58:55.816 --> 00:58:57.417]  And Living Defense is over-the-top good.
[00:58:59.195 --> 00:59:01.316]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[00:59:01.316 --> 00:59:04.096]  I'm Wilbur Snakeland.
[00:59:04.096 --> 00:59:25.783]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro to the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[00:59:26.824 --> 00:59:38.776]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential, and how fluoride's bad.
[00:59:38.776 --> 00:59:42.119]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[00:59:42.119 --> 00:59:44.822]  There's no medical journals, there's no facts.
[00:59:44.822 --> 00:59:46.183]  You need fluoride.
[00:59:48.857 --> 01:00:01.935]  And then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[01:00:01.935 --> 01:00:04.579]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:13.951 --> 01:00:16.072]  Despite the globalist's best efforts.
[01:00:16.072 --> 01:00:18.894]  Thanks to you.
[01:00:18.894 --> 01:00:21.615]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:21.615 --> 01:00:25.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:25.517 --> 01:00:26.438]  It is true.
[01:00:26.438 --> 01:00:31.560]  Thanks to your help, InfoWars relaunched Americana worldwide.
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:36.303]  I believe if we promoted what made the country great, people would rediscover it.
[01:00:37.486 --> 01:00:47.450]  But it had to be rediscovered right when the globalists uncloaked themselves with their anti-family, anti-God, anti-nation, anti-free market agenda.
[01:00:47.450 --> 01:01:03.136]  And right as they announced their world government and the fact that they're coming for your son's balls, literally as a sacrament, we had created the nucleus that's now gone supernova.
[01:01:03.136 --> 01:01:04.597]  We'll be back after this special report.
[01:01:05.543 --> 01:01:07.504]  If you control America, you can control the world.
[01:01:07.504 --> 01:01:08.785]  That's the big secret.
[01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:33.112]  And of course, if you're informed, it's not a secret at all.
[01:01:33.112 --> 01:01:36.535]  But to the ignorant, quite a bit is secret.
[01:01:36.535 --> 01:01:41.158]  Let's go all the way back to the first century B.C.
[01:01:41.158 --> 01:01:52.948]  It was in that century that a rather obscure philosopher by the name of Epictetus, who lived in the kingdom of Phrygia, had this to say.
[01:01:52.948 --> 01:01:56.210]  He said, appearances are of four kinds.
[01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:58.412]  Things either are as they appear to be,
[01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:03.162]  Or they neither are, nor appear to be.
[01:02:03.162 --> 01:02:06.843]  Or they are, but do not appear to be.
[01:02:06.843 --> 01:02:09.864]  Or they are not, and yet appear to be.
[01:02:09.864 --> 01:02:23.968]  Actually, I was convinced after I read that, that if Epictetus had been alive today, he surely would have been a Harvard professor of banking and probably would have written the definitive textbook on the Federal Reserve System.
[01:02:23.968 --> 01:02:26.609]  Occult just simply means hidden.
[01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:29.250]  And we fight occult left-hand path powers.
[01:02:30.267 --> 01:02:32.068]  Who wish to keep humanity in the dark?
[01:02:32.068 --> 01:02:38.470]  I wish to bring humanity into the light, the true light of God, not the false light of Lucifer.
[01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:39.090]  They're God.
[01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:44.432]  For example, after-school Satan clubs, which are causing a stir in places like Arizona.
[01:02:44.432 --> 01:02:46.393]  You bring up Satan this and you elicit a reaction.
[01:02:46.393 --> 01:02:50.434]  Especially when you think about putting it into school somehow, someway.
[01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:51.934]  And with snacks and things like that.
[01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:59.257]  The promotional materials for After School Satan include this cheery logo and a YouTube video that resembles a horror movie.
[01:02:59.717 --> 01:03:03.498]  Just the very idea that we were applying to have nine after-school Satan clubs to counteract them,
[01:03:20.704 --> 01:03:24.466]  brought the good news clubs into public consciousness, which was already a win for us.
[01:03:24.466 --> 01:03:28.788]  There's the manger scene with baby Jesus, and there's the candlesticks in the menorah for Hanukkah.
[01:03:28.788 --> 01:03:30.769]  Both of those put up by religious groups.
[01:03:30.769 --> 01:03:36.612]  Well, those groups not too thrilled with this latest installment of statue from the Satanic Temple of Chicago.
[01:03:36.732 --> 01:03:37.292]  I love you too!
[01:04:05.416 --> 01:04:11.537]  So you can hear the crowd obviously was not pleased with what he was saying and did support law enforcement escorting the man out.
[01:04:11.537 --> 01:04:21.259]  The Baphomet statue sat in the center of the rally, but comments about the lawmaker who spearheaded the push to bring the Ten Commandments to the Capitol took center stage.
[01:04:21.259 --> 01:04:30.241]  So here we are, ladies and gentlemen, in this moment where there is a battle by all these different factions over control of the United States.
[01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:32.882]  And almost everybody's hedging their bets out there.
[01:04:32.882 --> 01:04:34.702]  And no one's sure who's really going to come out on top.
[01:04:35.489 --> 01:04:37.071]  But they do know this.
[01:04:37.071 --> 01:04:45.378]  If you support President Trump, you get threatened, you get audited, you get harassed, you get spied on, you get killed.
[01:04:45.378 --> 01:04:57.189]  And then Trump, he just sits up there and promotes Americana and the belief in the country, but because he's not a dictator and isn't really in control, he can't even protect his own people.
[01:04:57.189 --> 01:04:59.352]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[01:05:06.854 --> 01:05:12.400]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.423]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[01:05:15.423 --> 01:05:19.848]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[01:05:19.848 --> 01:05:26.455]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[01:05:26.915 --> 01:05:32.920]  They might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:38.305]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[01:05:38.305 --> 01:05:45.892]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[01:05:46.072 --> 01:05:46.952]  It's that simple.
[01:05:46.952 --> 01:05:53.156]  Find out about the Iodine Conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[01:05:53.156 --> 01:05:56.958]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research Iodine Deficiency.
[01:05:56.958 --> 01:05:58.899]  It's the key to everything.
[01:05:58.899 --> 01:06:06.523]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality Iodine and Biotrus Selenium at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:06:13.513 --> 01:06:18.533]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:40.529 --> 01:06:47.474]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:06:47.474 --> 01:06:51.777]  You better believe you got one!
[01:06:51.777 --> 01:06:56.781]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:07:08.997 --> 01:07:14.679]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday edition.
[01:07:14.679 --> 01:07:23.822]  Please don't forget the very existence of this broadcast still being on air and still reaching millions every day is a testament to the fact that there's not just evil in this universe.
[01:07:23.822 --> 01:07:29.004]  There's not just the will of the corrupt and the twisted.
[01:07:29.004 --> 01:07:35.686]  There is the will of the good and those that want to stand up for what's right and those that are not intimidated by the globalist.
[01:07:36.758 --> 01:07:43.800]  In fact, we are scared of not taking action against them and letting the world be completely turned over to these monsters.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.521]  There is no bottom to these individuals.
[01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:50.462]  They have resonated to pure darkness and that is who they serve.
[01:07:50.462 --> 01:07:55.304]  Now, I want to get to some really important positive news right now.
[01:07:55.304 --> 01:08:02.926]  It's also very macabre and very terrifying and beyond anything that Hollywood could ever try to imagine because truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:08:02.926 --> 01:08:04.647]  And then I'm going to open the phones up
[01:08:05.632 --> 01:08:16.078]  Specifically, for first-time callers again, on the Baghdadi raid and those doubting that it happened, on the attempts to plunge the economy.
[01:08:16.078 --> 01:08:18.459]  You've heard that they've banned the OK sign.
[01:08:18.459 --> 01:08:22.742]  They'll throw you out of college for using it, whatever, because the ADL's God.
[01:08:22.742 --> 01:08:26.444]  Well, now Oxford University's banning clapping, saying it's hateful.
[01:08:27.785 --> 01:08:35.107]  Members, a few months ago we played the clip of people blowing up at a diversity thing at a college meeting and they're saying, stop clapping, it's evil, it's horrible.
[01:08:35.107 --> 01:08:38.408]  Well, we're going to break that down.
[01:08:38.408 --> 01:08:44.110]  At the birthplace of modern free speech, Oxford, it's just incredible how all of this is getting more and more insane.
[01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:52.373]  But it's designed to overthrow civilization by inflicting us with mass delirium, fever swamps, and mental illness.
[01:08:53.953 --> 01:08:56.615]  We'll also get into a report I haven't played yet.
[01:08:56.615 --> 01:08:59.317]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:08:59.317 --> 01:09:03.560]  UN takes over Utah taxpayer-funded venue.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:08.624]  Claims it's international territory.
[01:09:08.624 --> 01:09:10.205]  Wow, wait till you see that.
[01:09:10.205 --> 01:09:12.067]  That's got so many angles.
[01:09:12.067 --> 01:09:20.673]  A huge report here with George Soros making the statement that he will control God's will and that he will bend God to his will.
[01:09:20.673 --> 01:09:21.434]  That's in the New York Times.
[01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:23.788]  I'm attacked as well.
[01:09:23.788 --> 01:09:27.430]  We're going to get into all of that coming up.
[01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:31.774]  But I want to open the phones up on any subject you wish to discuss, as long as you're a first-time caller.
[01:09:31.774 --> 01:09:39.519]  And that means if you called in before but didn't get on, it looked like 15 calls or so yesterday, but the last three didn't get on, you go to the front of the line as well.
[01:09:39.519 --> 01:09:41.381]  The number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:09:41.381 --> 01:09:41.521]  877-789-Alex.
[01:09:41.521 --> 01:09:41.561]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:51.616 --> 01:09:52.236]  We're good to go.
[01:10:07.813 --> 01:10:17.318]  Because up until about 15 years ago, the media would talk about China selling political dissidents organs, Buddhist, Christian, you name it.
[01:10:17.318 --> 01:10:23.301]  And they even have mobile execution vans that anybody can just type in mobile execution van China.
[01:10:23.301 --> 01:10:26.723]  And China is proud of up to 15 vans per major city.
[01:10:27.863 --> 01:10:32.247]  That just drive around these mobile execution vans and people don't even know when they're gonna be executed.
[01:10:32.247 --> 01:10:32.927]  There's no judge.
[01:10:32.927 --> 01:10:36.970]  There's no jury There's nothing and then they take them from the facilities.
[01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:57.206]  They got them on the way to the airport And then they load them on ice and fly them into Japan the US you name it China's death buses delivered executions Orvin harvesting on the go gives moto China's high-tech death van where criminals are executed their organs are sold on the black market
[01:10:59.229 --> 01:11:04.990]  Now Fox News is finally getting into this because now America understands that under Obama, we were totally sold out to China.
[01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:06.051]  Now that's changing.
[01:11:06.051 --> 01:11:10.352]  Survivors and victims on shocking state-sanctioned organ harvesting in China.
[01:11:10.352 --> 01:11:14.433]  These are the folks trying to tell us how we can speak, what we can do.
[01:11:14.433 --> 01:11:19.874]  So here is part of that Fox News report that's so critical to get out to everybody you know.
[01:11:25.796 --> 01:11:27.397]  Let me tell you guys the clip we're going to go to here.
[01:11:27.397 --> 01:11:28.578]  Let me just pull it up for you right now.
[01:11:28.578 --> 01:11:30.819]  It's a Fox News report.
[01:11:30.819 --> 01:11:32.841]  It's in the list here.
[01:11:32.841 --> 01:11:34.742]  China's state-sanctioned organ harvesting.
[01:11:34.742 --> 01:11:34.942]  Go ahead.
[01:11:35.976 --> 01:11:49.084]  After months of independent investigation, the seven-person China Tribunal panel, which was initiated by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China, delivered its final findings in June.
[01:11:49.084 --> 01:12:04.794]  For over a decade, the People's Republic of China has stood publicly accused of acts of cruelty and wickedness that match the cruelty and wickedness of many evil torturers and executions.
[01:12:06.693 --> 01:12:16.977]  It's stated with certainty that in China, forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practiced for a substantial period of time.
[01:12:16.977 --> 01:12:32.723]  The report underscored that there were extraordinarily short waiting times for organs to be available for transplantation, and numerous websites advertised hearts, lungs, and kidneys for sale, suggesting an on-demand industry.
[01:12:33.886 --> 01:12:41.833]  The organs of members of marginalized groups detained in Chinese prisons and labor camps are unwillingly organ harvested.
[01:12:41.833 --> 01:12:55.886]  Most affected is a spiritual minority, the Falun Gong, who have been persecuted for rebuffing state atheism and adhering to a Buddhist-centric religious philosophy grounded in meditation and compassion.
[01:12:56.716 --> 01:13:05.683]  Witness testimonies provided to the tribunal paint the picture of a callous trade often performed when the victims are still alive.
[01:13:05.683 --> 01:13:13.328]  On January 27, 2009, four of my family members went to see my father at the labor camp in Chongqing.
[01:13:14.369 --> 01:13:19.371]  When we talked with him, his mental and physical health were completely normal.
[01:13:19.371 --> 01:13:22.032]  On January 28th, about 3.40 p.m.
[01:13:22.032 --> 01:13:29.714]  the next day, someone from the Xi Shanping labor camp called saying that my father had died at about 2.40 p.m.
[01:13:29.714 --> 01:13:34.956]  Her family members were taken to the Xijialiang Funeral Home by police cars.
[01:13:34.956 --> 01:13:37.717]  There were three slots in the freezer of the funeral home.
[01:13:38.237 --> 01:13:42.481]  My dad had been placed in the middle slot on the second freezer shelf.
[01:13:42.481 --> 01:13:47.105]  My sister touched my father's face and found that his lip was still warm.
[01:13:47.105 --> 01:13:49.707]  She yelled, Dad!
[01:13:49.707 --> 01:13:50.247]  Dad!
[01:13:50.247 --> 01:13:51.829]  My dad is still alive.
[01:13:51.829 --> 01:13:52.970]  He's not dead.
[01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:59.495]  We immediately pulled my dad's body out and put him on the ground.
[01:13:59.495 --> 01:14:01.657]  We wanted to check his body.
[01:14:01.657 --> 01:14:03.198]  Everyone touched him.
[01:14:03.198 --> 01:14:04.419]  His body was still warm.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.441]  Several dozen people were there.
[01:14:07.441 --> 01:14:10.162]  One of them said, it's no use making the phone call.
[01:14:10.162 --> 01:14:12.542]  The officers are here already.
[01:14:12.542 --> 01:14:14.283]  They won't come.
[01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:21.245]  My brother asked, how could a dead person still be warm after being frozen for more than seven hours?
[01:14:21.245 --> 01:14:30.348]  When we started to unbutton his clothes and check his body to see if there was anything wrong, each of us was picked up by four people and forcibly removed from the morgue.
[01:14:31.428 --> 01:14:37.552]  On February 8th, they called and told us that my father had been autopsied and then cremated.
[01:14:37.552 --> 01:14:44.857]  In his autopsy report, it said that three of his ribs were broken and all of his organs had been removed.
[01:14:44.857 --> 01:14:47.839]  My father was still alive and his body was still warm.
[01:14:47.839 --> 01:14:49.980]  How could you remove his organs?
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:54.183]  Without our family's consent, how could you just cremate him?
[01:14:54.183 --> 01:15:00.067]  We hired lawyers to sue the perpetrators and petitioned the higher authorities to seek justice for my father.
[01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:03.151]  Let's stop right here.
[01:15:03.151 --> 01:15:13.545]  We're going to come back and play the rest of this and this is just local corrupt governments that are killing people and then selling them back up and oh, he didn't die right away?
[01:15:13.545 --> 01:15:16.589]  But the state does it at an industrial scale.
[01:15:17.745 --> 01:15:26.090]  And so this is just a little side deal where they caught him, but the Chinese government officially runs ads saying we have fresh organs, they do this.
[01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:35.135]  And our media in the past covered it, but now they haven't been because China buys our debt, they own much of Hollywood, if not almost all of it.
[01:15:35.135 --> 01:15:35.935]  It's just incredible.
[01:15:35.935 --> 01:15:43.219]  We'll play the rest of the report, but this is only on Fox Digital, which means they put it out online.
[01:15:43.219 --> 01:15:43.760]  Think about that.
[01:15:44.679 --> 01:15:45.360]  Think about that.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.883]  They won't put that on national Fox News.
[01:15:47.883 --> 01:15:51.728]  They put it on the website and that's good, but that's not far enough.
[01:15:51.728 --> 01:15:53.350]  This needs to get out.
[01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:56.094]  And at least our media is starting to cover it some.
[01:15:56.094 --> 01:15:56.755]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:56.755 --> 01:15:58.237]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:15:58.237 --> 01:16:00.560]  The only way we beat the globalists is if you spread the word.
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.763]  Please, however you're listening, tell folks to tune in.
[01:16:05.996 --> 01:16:11.300]  One of the most frequently asked questions we get in customer service is, what is the Real Red Pill?
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.401]  And what is the Real Red Pill Plus?
[01:16:13.401 --> 01:16:19.325]  Well, Real Red Pill is a vitamin, mineral, multivitamin, high quality with preglanone.
[01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:25.650]  Real Red Pill Plus is the same thing with a little bit of clean added energy on top of it as well.
[01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:27.311]  That kicks in in 30 minutes.
[01:16:27.311 --> 01:16:30.513]  But the preglanone kicks in in about a week or so.
[01:16:31.494 --> 01:16:33.636]  Folks, look into preglanone for yourself.
[01:16:33.636 --> 01:16:44.007]  Look into high-end sources of it, like Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus, and then you'll definitely want to try it out and see the effects you get within about seven days to two weeks, generally.
[01:16:44.007 --> 01:16:45.949]  But believe me, it's a missing link.
[01:16:45.949 --> 01:16:46.990]  You need to find out about it.
[01:16:47.751 --> 01:16:49.853]  As we age, preglanone levels go down.
[01:16:49.853 --> 01:16:54.058]  All of our hormones in our body are manufactured by the body using preglanone.
[01:16:54.058 --> 01:17:00.524]  You need to learn about preglanone and then you need to get the Real Red Pill or the Real Red Pill Plus.

[01:17:16.893 --> 01:17:24.619]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[01:17:24.619 --> 01:17:32.485]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[01:17:32.645 --> 01:17:34.446]  Not a security IPO or note.
[01:17:34.446 --> 01:17:43.972]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.987]  Equipment offered poses a financial risk to owners.
[01:18:00.987 --> 01:18:02.712]  Consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[01:18:02.712 --> 01:18:05.220]  Not an offer to buy or sell the security which requires an offering document.
[01:18:06.829 --> 01:18:12.955]  Now what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners.
[01:18:12.955 --> 01:18:14.216]  I'm just stating the facts.
[01:18:14.216 --> 01:18:15.418]  I own a chainsaw.
[01:18:15.418 --> 01:18:17.380]  I've had it since I was in college.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:21.364]  And it's a great good old chainsaw and I've used it probably 500 times.
[01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:28.150]  But a few times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it.
[01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:30.272]  Now imagine if somebody told me to put
[01:18:31.033 --> 01:18:34.135]  Let's say superglue in the oil container on it.
[01:18:34.135 --> 01:18:35.576]  It would seize up forever.
[01:18:35.576 --> 01:18:37.357]  But only an evil person would do that.
[01:18:37.357 --> 01:18:40.339]  Well, fluoride's like putting superglue in a chainsaw.
[01:18:40.339 --> 01:18:41.540]  It's gonna make it seize up.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:43.261]  And that's why they put it in the water.
[01:18:43.261 --> 01:18:45.483]  And they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family.
[01:18:45.483 --> 01:18:46.724]  Yes, they're really evil.
[01:18:46.724 --> 01:18:51.647]  Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication.
[01:18:51.647 --> 01:18:52.568]  It's that simple.
[01:18:52.568 --> 01:18:56.190]  I know you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late.
[01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:57.651]  It's part of the iodine conspiracy.
[01:18:57.931 --> 01:19:02.155]  Find out more at InfoWarsTore.com and take action against the globalists.
[01:19:02.155 --> 01:19:04.077]  Carbon's everywhere on this planet!
[01:19:04.077 --> 01:19:06.779]  It's almost like we're carbon-based lifeforms!
[01:19:06.779 --> 01:19:09.181]  Hello today on All Things Considered.
[01:19:09.181 --> 01:19:18.709]  I'm Wilbur Snakely to tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:22.513]  Now sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that
[01:19:22.993 --> 01:19:28.737]  It's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[01:19:28.737 --> 01:19:29.678]  That's right.
[01:19:29.678 --> 01:19:31.559]  Drink the fluoride.
[01:19:31.559 --> 01:19:35.922]  Don't visit Infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen.
[01:19:35.922 --> 01:19:37.343]  I mean the bad halogen.
[01:19:37.343 --> 01:19:38.064]  Iodine.
[01:19:38.064 --> 01:19:40.846]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[01:19:41.586 --> 01:19:48.030]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us.
[01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:49.691]  We don't want to compete with you.
[01:19:49.691 --> 01:19:52.352]  Just drink the fluoride.
[01:19:52.352 --> 01:19:56.115]  Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do.
[01:19:56.115 --> 01:19:58.276]  Don't support Alex Jones.
[01:19:58.276 --> 01:20:02.698]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal.
[01:20:02.698 --> 01:20:04.860]  Oh, and let Nambla have access to your children.
[01:20:09.908 --> 01:20:12.524]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:42.970 --> 01:20:43.971]  We are back live.
[01:20:43.971 --> 01:20:45.071]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:45.071 --> 01:20:51.394]  I'm going to finish up this China report from Fox.
[01:20:51.394 --> 01:20:55.916]  And then we're going to go to your phone calls right through to the bottom of the next hour.
[01:20:55.916 --> 01:20:57.477]  Then Mike Adams is going to be in studio.
[01:20:57.477 --> 01:20:59.298]  He's going to take over the fourth hour.
[01:20:59.298 --> 01:21:05.161]  He has the producers from the award-winning censored and blocked film, Vaxxed.
[01:21:06.291 --> 01:21:09.812]  There's been some big developments on that front as well.
[01:21:09.812 --> 01:21:29.816]  Of course you saw Zuckerberg being questioned about vaccine damage and Congress last week and why he censors mothers and fathers talking about how their child had a convulsion after vaccines and why people can't rate vaccines like they could before in consumer sites and why Facebook's blocking consumer sites.
[01:21:29.816 --> 01:21:32.277]  Because Big Pharma can't handle what consumers are saying.
[01:21:33.988 --> 01:21:37.490]  So that's all coming up as well, but your phone calls start of the next segment.
[01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:38.590]  I'm going directly to them.
[01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:39.290]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:41.952]  Get ready.
[01:21:41.952 --> 01:21:45.053]  Let's finish up with China.
[01:21:45.053 --> 01:21:47.434]  And obviously everybody knows they're selling organs.
[01:21:47.434 --> 01:21:52.577]  Everybody knows that Mao killed 80 plus million and then it's 115 million total.
[01:21:52.577 --> 01:21:55.438]  The Chinese government admits, but gives reasons why they did it.
[01:21:55.438 --> 01:21:57.999]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:21:57.999 --> 01:21:59.600]  And all the footage that came out a month ago of
[01:22:00.731 --> 01:22:07.875]  The two million person concentration camp in Mongolia and 600 people being marched out with hoods over their heads being choked.
[01:22:07.875 --> 01:22:18.020]  That's what they do when they take you to be executed, is they choke you while you're being taken to the mobile execution vans.
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:18.900]  That's the procedure.
[01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:22.482]  They have public executions at sports stadiums.
[01:22:22.482 --> 01:22:26.124]  Talking back to the government, you get killed.
[01:22:26.124 --> 01:22:28.465]  If people get hit by a car, the person lays there,
[01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:31.178]  And rots.
[01:22:31.178 --> 01:22:37.761]  Even in a busy street until... Sanitation might come by in a week when maggots are all over it.
[01:22:37.761 --> 01:22:40.202]  Because there's no value for human life in China.
[01:22:40.202 --> 01:22:43.223]  But we project onto China, oh, you're not white!
[01:22:43.223 --> 01:22:45.484]  We've been taught whites are bad!
[01:22:45.484 --> 01:22:47.085]  You're wonderful!
[01:22:47.085 --> 01:22:48.006]  You're Asian!
[01:22:48.006 --> 01:22:50.367]  You're perfect!
[01:22:50.367 --> 01:22:51.687]  Well, yeah, there are a lot of great Asian people.
[01:22:51.687 --> 01:22:54.128]  They try to move here to get away from it.
[01:22:54.128 --> 01:22:57.630]  But China is the most ruthless towards life of any country over there.
[01:22:59.261 --> 01:23:10.191]  And the NBA bowing and fetching and scraping and when China says jump they say how high except for Shaquille O'Neal.
[01:23:10.191 --> 01:23:16.796]  It's shameful to see all the groveling by LeBron James and the rest of it.
[01:23:16.796 --> 01:23:22.902]  And think about this, this is a government of communists that David Rockefeller and leftists praise everywhere.
[01:23:23.885 --> 01:23:26.686]  Because it's a bunch of rich people feeding off slaves.
[01:23:26.686 --> 01:23:28.426]  That's why Bill Gates supports it.
[01:23:28.426 --> 01:23:30.466]  That's why, because they're all tax-exempt.
[01:23:30.466 --> 01:23:34.147]  No wonder Bill Gates and Warren Buffett run around saying, I'm paying too much taxes, raise taxes on me.
[01:23:34.147 --> 01:23:35.707]  Because they're tax-exempt.
[01:23:35.707 --> 01:23:42.469]  They put their money in tax-exempt foundations and call themselves philanthropists.
[01:23:42.469 --> 01:23:46.269]  And then push for higher taxes on the middle class because he wants that money controlled by him.
[01:23:46.269 --> 01:23:49.210]  Because any money not controlled by them is money that's free.
[01:23:50.165 --> 01:23:53.386]  They want vertical integration of the economy.
[01:23:53.386 --> 01:23:56.427]  They want control.
[01:23:56.427 --> 01:24:01.248]  Where's our empathy?
[01:24:01.248 --> 01:24:03.829]  I mean, in China, the state can get away with anything.
[01:24:03.829 --> 01:24:08.050]  You know what happens if you talk back to the police in China?
[01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:13.511]  They cut your genitals off.
[01:24:13.511 --> 01:24:15.112]  And then cut your Achilles heels.
[01:24:17.762 --> 01:24:23.765]  And then no one helps you, and you crawl around sometimes for a week in the street.
[01:24:23.765 --> 01:24:31.889]  And anyone that helps you gets sent to a forced labor camp.
[01:24:31.889 --> 01:24:39.012]  So you'll just be routinely, there's just people in the bushes, just crawling with a pool of blood behind them.
[01:24:43.971 --> 01:24:46.373]  The authoritarians love to chop testicles off.
[01:24:46.373 --> 01:24:47.254]  It's part of their religions.
[01:24:47.254 --> 01:24:48.135]  I'm not joking.
[01:24:48.135 --> 01:24:49.576]  That's why they get the liberal mothers here.
[01:24:49.576 --> 01:24:51.097]  They just fantasize on it.
[01:24:51.097 --> 01:24:53.579]  Oh, if I could just have a son that could chop his balls off.
[01:24:53.579 --> 01:24:54.400]  Oh, it'd be so wonderful.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.903]  You have to understand, this is satanic behavior, folks.
[01:24:57.903 --> 01:24:59.965]  Immutilating women and hurting little girls.
[01:24:59.965 --> 01:25:03.128]  It's all about hurting humanity.
[01:25:03.128 --> 01:25:07.572]  I'm not kidding!
[01:25:07.572 --> 01:25:08.433]  So let's finish the report.
[01:25:08.433 --> 01:25:08.713]  Here it is.
[01:25:13.154 --> 01:25:21.136]  China boasts that it sustains the largest voluntary organ donation system in Asia, but experts contend that the country does not have a history of willful organ donation.
[01:25:21.136 --> 01:25:21.376]  Oh, really?
[01:25:21.376 --> 01:25:21.837]  You think so?
[01:25:21.837 --> 01:25:35.541]  The official figures are 10,000 transplants each year, understates the real volume which activists pledges, pledging upwards of 60,000 to 100,000 annually.
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:57.551]  Yu Ming, another member of Falun Gong, and newly arrived in the United States, claimed that he was kidnapped multiple times by law enforcement, the most recent time in August 2013, and locked up in the Shenyang Detention Center, where he was allegedly beaten into oblivion.
[01:25:57.551 --> 01:26:07.738]  He secretly recorded footage at major military hospitals in mainland China over the past couple of years, and has turned it over to the courts as evidence for unlawful organ transplants.
[01:26:08.861 --> 01:26:18.290]  In the prison and labor camps, every Falun Gong practitioner is forced to get a blood test and a physical check.
[01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:24.436]  But when you are really ill, you got sick, they don't take care of you.
[01:26:24.436 --> 01:26:27.379]  But when you are healthy, you don't have any issue.
[01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.409]  Yeah.
[01:26:48.954 --> 01:26:54.215]  Thoroughly, and they found my liver had some issues, so they just gave up.
[01:26:54.215 --> 01:26:58.996]  They forced me to stay in the hospital for about six months.
[01:26:58.996 --> 01:27:05.378]  The second time was in 2008 to 2009.
[01:27:05.378 --> 01:27:10.559]  I was forced to stay in the hospital in Masanjia for about one year.
[01:27:12.432 --> 01:27:16.813]  Because my liver had some issues, they just gave up.
[01:27:16.813 --> 01:27:18.214]  There's a third time.
[01:27:18.214 --> 01:27:24.616]  The third time was when I was in the prison, not labor camp, 2016 to 17.
[01:27:24.616 --> 01:27:29.677]  During this period, I witnessed a lot of people died.
[01:27:29.677 --> 01:27:34.799]  After I was released at the end of 2017, I began to investigate.
[01:27:34.799 --> 01:27:39.280]  I just went to different hospitals in different cities to investigate the organ harvest.
[01:27:41.937 --> 01:27:46.641]  According to the China Tribunal, there are mountains of money to be made.
[01:27:46.641 --> 01:27:55.928]  Data from 2007 shows that hospitals charge more than $65,000 for kidney transplant, $130,000 for liver, and more than $150,000 for lung or heartbeat.
[01:27:55.928 --> 01:28:00.511]  In the United States, they just do it to babies, of course, so it's liberal.
[01:28:00.511 --> 01:28:03.473]  Keep the babies alive, liberal.
[01:28:03.473 --> 01:28:09.838]  Desperate patients might make a high-priced donation for a new organ at top speed.
[01:28:09.838 --> 01:28:10.499]  That's okay.
[01:28:11.755 --> 01:28:20.366]  The practice is alleged to have started in the 90s on a small scale and was initially characterized as targeting the forceful removal of organs of prisoners on death row.
[01:28:20.366 --> 01:28:26.233]  Now it's for everybody, because business is good, to communist utopia.
[01:28:28.579 --> 01:28:32.142]  We just do it to babies after they're born, so that makes it liberal.
[01:28:32.142 --> 01:28:38.067]  Survivors routinely point to the frequent physical screenings, ultrasounds, and x-rays.
[01:28:38.067 --> 01:28:42.010]  Alright, folks, when we come back, we're gonna get to your phone calls, but in post.
[01:28:42.010 --> 01:28:44.532]  I'll have this article at InfoWars.com, this video.
[01:28:44.532 --> 01:28:46.494]  I'll put the full report there.
[01:28:46.494 --> 01:28:48.155]  But you can find it at FoxNews.com.
[01:28:48.155 --> 01:28:52.279]  Survivors and victims of shocking state-sanctioned organ harvesting in China.
[01:28:52.279 --> 01:28:53.100]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:53.901 --> 01:28:59.151]  Working for a pro-human future of dignity and justice for us all.
[01:28:59.151 --> 01:29:01.937]  And I will never surrender, and I know you won't as well.

[01:30:08.516 --> 01:30:10.257]  Hello, here.
[01:30:10.257 --> 01:30:12.237]  My name is Bethelmead.
[01:30:12.237 --> 01:30:15.078]  I work for my father, Lucifer.
[01:30:15.078 --> 01:30:24.682]  And he doesn't like the fact that God gave you all families and children, and so... We want to tell you something right now, Christian countries.
[01:30:24.682 --> 01:30:27.123]  We took control of you over a hundred years ago.
[01:30:27.123 --> 01:30:32.165]  We've been spiking your water with fluoride to lower your fertility and to hurt you.
[01:30:32.925 --> 01:30:44.452]  And it's worked so well, but now because of liability, and because of people warning inside the government what's happening, the Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done.
[01:30:44.452 --> 01:30:50.575]  And it makes me so angry, so whatever you do, just stay in that haze, and drink fluoride and give it to your children.
[01:30:52.739 --> 01:31:02.802]  Again, I'm not talking down to the InfoWars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride, and I'm talking about ionine.
[01:31:02.802 --> 01:31:06.143]  Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat,
[01:31:21.167 --> 01:31:28.483]  Let's say an old Blastron boat, and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:30.808]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live.
[01:31:31.795 --> 01:31:33.376]  Okay, it's the same thing.
[01:31:33.376 --> 01:31:36.418]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride.
[01:31:36.418 --> 01:31:39.280]  That's why, in every western nation, they put it in the water.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:41.422]  They're going to teach us Christians to lay down and die.
[01:31:41.422 --> 01:31:43.263]  The Chai Kams don't put it in the water.
[01:31:43.263 --> 01:31:44.784]  They'd execute you if you did that.
[01:31:44.784 --> 01:31:52.749]  They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else.
[01:31:52.749 --> 01:31:56.692]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:56.692 --> 01:31:58.273]  We have all the documents and articles linked.
[01:31:58.593 --> 01:32:02.994]  And then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[01:32:02.994 --> 01:32:08.595]  Again, get iodine at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:32:08.595 --> 01:32:11.635]  Here are the facts.
[01:32:11.635 --> 01:32:20.717]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies, including the American Medical Journal.
[01:32:20.717 --> 01:32:27.138]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer, and destroys fertility.
[01:32:27.138 --> 01:32:27.978]  That's the facts.
[01:32:29.716 --> 01:32:30.496]  I don't know.
[01:32:56.129 --> 01:32:57.191]  Warn others.
[01:32:57.191 --> 01:32:59.293]  This is the Achilles heel of the globalist.
[01:32:59.293 --> 01:33:00.535]  It's a win-win situation.
[01:33:00.535 --> 01:33:02.258]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[01:33:02.258 --> 01:33:09.908]  Take action now.
[01:33:09.908 --> 01:33:12.552]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.203 --> 01:33:24.687]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:56.677 --> 01:33:59.338]  Epic music for epic times.
[01:33:59.338 --> 01:34:07.562]  Thank you for joining us on this live Monday, October 28th, 2019, worldwide transmission.
[01:34:07.562 --> 01:34:13.365]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls on any subject you wish to bring up.
[01:34:14.355 --> 01:34:20.777]  Bo, and Marcus, and U-Haul, and Aaron, and Bonnie, and John, and Daniel, Patrick, and many, many others.
[01:34:20.777 --> 01:34:26.338]  877-789-2539 is the number for you to get in on when you hear somebody hang up.
[01:34:26.338 --> 01:34:29.019]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:34:29.019 --> 01:34:29.639]  Okay.
[01:34:29.639 --> 01:34:31.720]  Callers are always great, and I've gotten a little bit better.
[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.300]  I used to be really good 20 years ago.
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.961]  I could take like 50 calls in a show.
[01:34:35.961 --> 01:34:36.721]  Sometimes 70, 80, 100.
[01:34:36.721 --> 01:34:39.782]  Just because I said, bam, bam, bam, run the calls myself.
[01:34:41.357 --> 01:34:42.798]  And then I got to where I never really take calls.
[01:34:42.798 --> 01:34:49.122]  I got a little bit better about going to your calls, but just boom, get to the point, get to your question, and then we're going to move the next person.
[01:34:49.122 --> 01:34:49.662]  I love you.
[01:34:49.662 --> 01:34:50.182]  You're awesome.
[01:34:50.182 --> 01:34:52.084]  No need to tell me how much you love the show.
[01:34:52.084 --> 01:34:53.324]  We know you're here.
[01:34:53.324 --> 01:34:54.865]  You're the reason we're here.
[01:34:54.865 --> 01:34:58.788]  We're very, very thankful to all of you.
[01:34:58.788 --> 01:35:09.054]  So without further ado, let's go to Aaron in Washington State on the raid that killed Baghdadi that people are questioning.
[01:35:09.872 --> 01:35:14.616]  The left is making it political, saying Trump's trying to get brownie points.
[01:35:14.616 --> 01:35:16.478]  That's, you know, ridiculous, obviously.
[01:35:16.478 --> 01:35:19.480]  I mean, would Trump deserve brownie points for trying to end the war?
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:21.642]  And the military deserves brownie points for killing this guy?
[01:35:21.642 --> 01:35:22.763]  I believe it's real.
[01:35:22.763 --> 01:35:24.144]  With Trump, you get real action.
[01:35:24.144 --> 01:35:27.187]  Plus, if he wasn't real, Trump would get set up by people.
[01:35:27.187 --> 01:35:29.189]  So I believe the operation's real.
[01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:30.930]  But again, people are allowed to question it.
[01:35:30.930 --> 01:35:31.731]  What do you think, Aaron?
[01:35:33.123 --> 01:35:37.747]  Yeah, actually I'm just calling to find out what you think about our forces staying there and still guarding the oil.
[01:35:37.747 --> 01:35:44.752]  Rand Paul put out a tweet Saturday the 26th telling Trump not to listen to Lindsey Graham and Chuck Schumer, not to stay in Syria.
[01:35:44.752 --> 01:35:49.976]  So I'm wondering what our forces are going to be doing there, how long they're going to be there for, and why we're still guarding that oil.
[01:35:50.984 --> 01:36:00.253]  Well that was fake news a few weeks ago when Trump said he was pulling 40 troops out of an area because Turkey had been saying for years they were going to go in there.
[01:36:00.253 --> 01:36:04.037]  They'd already taken over part of the country before to the west.
[01:36:04.943 --> 01:36:07.885]  They had that huge border on the west all the way to the north.
[01:36:07.885 --> 01:36:12.948]  And so Trump pulled out because he knew that the Kurds had been doing excursions into Turkey.
[01:36:12.948 --> 01:36:16.990]  And so they would then broker a deal after to give them a small homeland.
[01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.670]  So I know U.S.
[01:36:17.670 --> 01:36:18.831]  troops are there now.
[01:36:18.831 --> 01:36:23.153]  I know that previously we would always take over areas and give the oil to the Chinese.
[01:36:23.153 --> 01:36:32.219]  Almost all the oil in Baghdad and all the surrounding areas of Iraq went to a consortium that gave the oil to the French.
[01:36:33.208 --> 01:36:36.590]  The Chai comms and the Japanese, why do we pay for the security?
[01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:41.433]  So I think Trump wants us to be open to bid to get the oil if we see fit.
[01:36:41.433 --> 01:36:46.076]  Now that gets into the argument of, oh, we've gone there for the oil, but Trump was against those wars.
[01:36:46.076 --> 01:36:50.079]  Now that we're there, if people want to sell us oil, I think that's their right to do it.
[01:36:50.079 --> 01:36:50.539]  What do you think?
[01:36:51.587 --> 01:36:58.689]  Yeah, and I totally agree with him going from the beginning of his campaign saying that, you know, if we're going to go anywhere for oil, we might as well actually grab it.
[01:36:58.689 --> 01:37:05.050]  You know, we're leaving a ton of oil in Iraq and other places, and we're guarding it there, spending money and lives, but we didn't get anything out of it.
[01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:10.032]  So, I mean, I guess it makes sense to defend your product here, but... And it's very pragmatic.
[01:37:10.032 --> 01:37:11.412]  He didn't... He was against both wars.
[01:37:12.375 --> 01:37:12.695]  Right.
[01:37:12.695 --> 01:37:14.056]  And he's trying to completely get out of there.
[01:37:14.056 --> 01:37:14.136]  Yeah.
[01:37:38.243 --> 01:37:40.045]  Yeah, I'm just curious how long it's going to take.
[01:37:40.045 --> 01:37:41.626]  That's the only thing.
[01:37:41.626 --> 01:37:43.527]  It's been a while that we've been over there now.
[01:37:43.527 --> 01:37:54.417]  Yeah, 10 years, almost 19 in Afghanistan, and now suddenly all the liberals are these big hawks and Trump is cutting and running.
[01:37:54.417 --> 01:37:56.498]  Well, this doesn't feel like cutting and running to me.
[01:37:56.498 --> 01:37:59.561]  It sounds like getting out of quicksand and cutting the head off the snake.
[01:38:00.481 --> 01:38:02.881]  Yeah, even Russia came out recently and said RT.
[01:38:02.881 --> 01:38:07.722]  Originally they were like, well, they don't know if he's really dead, but now all of a sudden, if he is dead, well, you know, he did the world a really big favor.
[01:38:07.722 --> 01:38:08.703]  And that's out of the Kremlin.
[01:38:08.703 --> 01:38:12.763]  So, I mean, if they're supporting each other, then that's got to be something good, right?
[01:38:12.763 --> 01:38:17.464]  Well, we know that the globalists were using al-Qaeda under different names as a destabilizer.
[01:38:17.464 --> 01:38:22.125]  And Trump went in and took over the Saudi government and said, you do it anymore, you're dead.
[01:38:22.125 --> 01:38:23.126]  And so they stopped.
[01:38:23.126 --> 01:38:25.206]  And that's why we're cleaning this up finally.
[01:38:25.206 --> 01:38:29.887]  And it's a very positive thing Trump and the Pentagon are doing, is getting rid of what the deep state helped create.
[01:38:30.407 --> 01:38:33.128]  You know, going back to 1979 was Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[01:38:33.128 --> 01:38:38.571]  It was not Reagan that created the Taliban or what became Al Qaeda.
[01:38:38.571 --> 01:38:40.412]  It was Jimmy Carter.
[01:38:40.412 --> 01:38:44.555]  And they lured the Russians in by attacking Russian outposts.
[01:38:44.555 --> 01:38:46.636]  And you go, oh, what a genius idea!
[01:38:46.636 --> 01:38:48.417]  Except then the blowback of it.
[01:38:48.417 --> 01:38:51.859]  And the whole time, the deep state's had its hands in there using it.
[01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:53.059]  I appreciate your call.
[01:38:53.059 --> 01:38:54.980]  Thank you, Aaron.
[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:56.141]  It's ridiculous.
[01:38:56.141 --> 01:38:58.702]  And Trump's like, why the hell are we trying to destabilize the planet?
[01:38:58.702 --> 01:38:59.543]  We're not going to do that.
[01:39:00.205 --> 01:39:05.068]  And by the way, he says to the arms makers, we'll sell more of our weapons than ever that way.
[01:39:05.068 --> 01:39:10.191]  You can have your weapon sales, peace through strength, but we're not going to be the bad guys.
[01:39:10.191 --> 01:39:15.634]  And again, America was not openly the bad guy until the mid-60s.
[01:39:15.634 --> 01:39:19.257]  And then we got globalists in control, and they're just nasty folks.
[01:39:19.257 --> 01:39:24.560]  And they want us to lose the wars and get the blame while we launch all these wars for the globalists.
[01:39:25.506 --> 01:39:30.471]  Just like communists will take control of a country, ultra-rich robber barons almost always run it.
[01:39:30.471 --> 01:39:39.460]  They get all the security and power from the Russians or the Chai Koms taking over an area, and then the Russians and the Chai Koms pay for it all in blood, sweat, and tears.
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:41.002]  Well, that's what America does as well.
[01:39:41.002 --> 01:39:43.565]  That's how the multinational globalists operate.
[01:39:44.639 --> 01:39:48.763]  And Carol Quigley wrote an 1100 page book on it in 1968.
[01:39:48.763 --> 01:39:51.306]  We sell the book at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:51.306 --> 01:39:52.608]  Go read it!
[01:39:52.608 --> 01:39:55.351]  You'll go, oh my gosh, it's what they're trying to do today!
[01:39:55.351 --> 01:40:00.476]  And everything Trump's doing is pragmatically saying we're not going to be bad guys anymore.
[01:40:00.476 --> 01:40:02.038]  The American people don't want it.
[01:40:02.038 --> 01:40:03.720]  It's not good for our business.
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:05.341]  It's not good for our country.
[01:40:05.341 --> 01:40:06.643]  It's going to stop.
[01:40:09.528 --> 01:40:12.209]  And people are scared of Trump.
[01:40:12.209 --> 01:40:13.910]  These foreign leaders, they're scared of him.
[01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:16.251]  Because they know he's the real deal.
[01:40:16.251 --> 01:40:20.633]  And they know if they do play games, then they're going to really get it.
[01:40:20.633 --> 01:40:24.755]  We saw both the books, The Anglo-American Establishment and Tragedy and Hope, both by Carol Quigley.
[01:40:24.755 --> 01:40:26.236]  You might want to read it.
[01:40:26.236 --> 01:40:30.638]  Okay, that was a great caller, but I'm blowing through time here.
[01:40:30.638 --> 01:40:34.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.681]  Let's talk to Hugh Hall in Ohio.
[01:40:35.681 --> 01:40:36.281]  Thanks for calling.
[01:40:37.861 --> 01:40:39.203]  Hi Alex, how are you doing today?
[01:40:39.203 --> 01:40:40.626]  Good, brother.
[01:40:40.626 --> 01:40:40.946]  Good.
[01:40:40.946 --> 01:40:41.968]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:40:41.968 --> 01:40:44.713]  Anyway, I wanted to congratulate the president on his victory.
[01:40:44.713 --> 01:40:47.999]  Pretty much the same time that the last president in his third year.
[01:40:47.999 --> 01:40:49.783]  Oh, he had Ben Laden back then, but...
[01:40:50.464 --> 01:40:55.508]  Back then, YouTube was around, so there would have been footage of the coffin being released into the ocean.
[01:40:55.508 --> 01:41:02.514]  This time around, like the Ukrainian transcripts, he has to release footage for proof because everyone's doubting him.
[01:41:02.514 --> 01:41:12.123]  And he's saying he is going to, and I was just in there getting coffee during the break, and Fox News was going, he shouldn't release the video, it'll endanger our troops.
[01:41:12.123 --> 01:41:13.264]  That's pure crap.
[01:41:15.219 --> 01:41:17.522]  Can I give a compliment on one product?
[01:41:17.522 --> 01:41:23.829]  And then I have a question that I'll hang up and the next call for my bronchitis, the collodial silver is good.
[01:41:23.829 --> 01:41:28.955]  And one thing to take up on and I don't know whether or not you've had any consideration collodial gold.
[01:41:28.955 --> 01:41:31.638]  I've tried that as well, but I know that's patent based.
[01:41:32.509 --> 01:41:37.511]  And my question is, is that there's been a rumor, some sort of prediction about Seattle this Sunday.
[01:41:37.511 --> 01:41:39.012]  I wanted to call you yesterday about it.
[01:41:39.012 --> 01:41:44.635]  I know it might be just nothing more but a rumor, but still... What have you heard?
[01:41:44.635 --> 01:41:46.216]  Because I'm in the dark.
[01:41:46.216 --> 01:41:47.696]  What's happening?
[01:41:47.696 --> 01:41:54.580]  Well, what it is, is that during the... There's some sort of prediction that something will happen in Seattle and it's not good.
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:42:01.503]  It's something... I don't know if it's comparable to 9-11 or... But there has been, I guess, YouTube videos or...
[01:42:02.153 --> 01:42:03.674]  Something comparing that to 9-11.
[01:42:03.674 --> 01:42:05.816]  Hopefully nothing will.
[01:42:05.816 --> 01:42:09.860]  The power outage... Well you know, I haven't heard of that, but there were not just rumors.
[01:42:09.860 --> 01:42:11.461]  It was in the news the week before 9-11.
[01:42:13.716 --> 01:42:18.018]  At local public schools, Muslim kids said that building's not going to be there next week.
[01:42:18.018 --> 01:42:19.799]  People went and checked and it was true.
[01:42:19.799 --> 01:42:26.001]  And then it turned out that half the regular folks that were going to be at work were not in Tower 1, 2, or 7.
[01:42:26.001 --> 01:42:28.122]  That was confirmed by local news.
[01:42:28.122 --> 01:42:30.843]  Trump talked about bombs clearly being in the buildings.
[01:42:30.843 --> 01:42:34.545]  Days after it happened on national TV, we probably played that 50 times.
[01:42:34.545 --> 01:42:36.266]  So that's really a great point that you raise.
[01:42:37.146 --> 01:42:48.351]  Um, I know this, the globalists have been saying Trump pulling out of Syria is going to cause Al-Qaeda to attack us, so could they stage something to make it look like Trump isn't keeping us safe?
[01:42:48.351 --> 01:42:51.353]  Let me ask you what you think, U-Haul and the other side.
[01:42:51.353 --> 01:42:56.615]  But they've certainly been pre-programming that Trump's going to cause a terror attack.
[01:42:56.615 --> 01:42:58.916]  And could that be how they try to set him up?
[01:42:58.916 --> 01:43:00.277]  Let's talk about that with U-Haul.
[01:43:00.277 --> 01:43:01.378]  I want to get your final comment.
[01:43:01.378 --> 01:43:01.978]  U-Haul, stay with us.
[01:43:05.836 --> 01:43:06.857]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[01:43:06.857 --> 01:43:07.937]  Hey Alex!
[01:43:07.937 --> 01:43:09.298]  Oh my God!
[01:43:09.298 --> 01:43:12.100]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:14.722]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[01:43:14.722 --> 01:43:18.545]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June.
[01:43:18.545 --> 01:43:22.167]  And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[01:43:22.167 --> 01:43:23.008]  Let me tell you something, man.
[01:43:23.568 --> 01:43:28.753]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years.
[01:43:28.753 --> 01:43:30.995]  And the doctors, they tried every test.
[01:43:30.995 --> 01:43:32.757]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[01:43:32.757 --> 01:43:36.761]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[01:43:36.761 --> 01:43:39.103]  I'm gonna get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[01:43:39.103 --> 01:43:43.367]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff, but I ordered and had it shipped.
[01:43:43.487 --> 01:43:44.068]  It's true, folks.
[01:43:44.068 --> 01:43:46.450]  We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality.
[01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:48.292]  And living defense is over-the-top good.
[01:44:06.089 --> 01:44:08.210]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:10.990]  I'm Wilbur Snakeland.
[01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:32.677]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro to the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[01:44:33.717 --> 01:44:45.667]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad.
[01:44:45.667 --> 01:44:49.009]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[01:44:49.009 --> 01:44:50.210]  There's no medical journals.
[01:44:50.210 --> 01:44:51.711]  There's no facts.
[01:44:51.711 --> 01:44:53.153]  You need fluoride.
[01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:54.734]  Just drink extra fluoride.
[01:44:55.776 --> 01:45:01.971]  And then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[01:45:05.987 --> 01:45:17.893]  Hello today on All Things Considered, I'm Wilbur Snakely here to tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[01:45:17.893 --> 01:45:27.978]  Now sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that it's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[01:45:27.978 --> 01:45:30.239]  That's right, drink the fluoride.
[01:45:30.759 --> 01:45:35.101]  Don't visit Infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen.
[01:45:35.101 --> 01:45:36.541]  I mean the bad halogen.
[01:45:36.541 --> 01:45:37.262]  Iodine.
[01:45:37.262 --> 01:45:40.803]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[01:45:40.803 --> 01:45:47.226]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us.
[01:45:47.226 --> 01:45:48.906]  We don't want to compete with you.
[01:45:48.906 --> 01:45:51.567]  Just drink the fluoride.
[01:45:51.567 --> 01:45:52.788]  Don't learn about
[01:45:53.388 --> 01:45:57.492]  How deadly it is, and whatever you do, don't support Alex Jones.
[01:45:57.492 --> 01:46:01.917]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal.
[01:46:01.917 --> 01:46:04.500]  Oh, and let Nambla have access to your children, huh?
[01:46:06.226 --> 01:46:11.751]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[01:46:11.751 --> 01:46:14.794]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[01:46:14.794 --> 01:46:19.218]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[01:46:19.218 --> 01:46:25.824]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[01:46:26.264 --> 01:46:32.291]  They might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[01:46:32.291 --> 01:46:37.658]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[01:46:37.658 --> 01:46:45.247]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[01:46:45.427 --> 01:46:46.328]  It's that simple.
[01:46:46.328 --> 01:46:52.531]  Find out about the Iodine Conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com and find out why the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[01:46:52.531 --> 01:46:56.313]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research Iodine Deficiency.
[01:46:56.313 --> 01:46:58.255]  It's the key to everything.
[01:46:58.255 --> 01:47:09.421]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality Iodine and BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:47:09.421 --> 01:47:12.063]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:44.935 --> 01:47:50.998]  There's really no way to overstate what an incredible time we're living here on this planet.
[01:47:50.998 --> 01:47:55.801]  Just how wondrous consciousness really is.
[01:47:55.801 --> 01:47:57.982]  You're taking your phone calls right now.
[01:47:57.982 --> 01:48:00.404]  Caller in Ohio, going by the handle U-Home.
[01:48:02.523 --> 01:48:06.424]  There's a lot of buzz and hype about something big in Seattle.
[01:48:06.424 --> 01:48:10.805]  And we see these type of things on the internet sometimes and most of the time nothing happens with them.
[01:48:10.805 --> 01:48:18.367]  But on 9-11 there was a lot of chatter and we saw that that indeed did end up happening.
[01:48:18.367 --> 01:48:26.069]  I saw counsel on foreign relation members on Hardball with Chris Matthews a couple months before 9-11.
[01:48:26.069 --> 01:48:26.149]  And
[01:48:30.714 --> 01:48:33.236]  It was a particular CFR commission.
[01:48:33.236 --> 01:48:36.219]  Had several guests on there.
[01:48:36.219 --> 01:48:41.743]  And they were talking about big things are about to happen, big change, big buildings are going to be coming down.
[01:48:41.743 --> 01:48:45.246]  And when these big things happen, the whole world's going to be different.
[01:48:45.246 --> 01:48:57.877]  Then later, that exact same individual went on C-SPAN and said,
[01:49:01.519 --> 01:49:15.025]  A lot of really incredible things about how we need to use 9-11 to basically take the American people's rights.
[01:49:15.025 --> 01:49:19.507]  I'm trying to remember that individual's names and it just popped in my head.
[01:49:19.507 --> 01:49:24.130]  Gary Hart.
[01:49:24.130 --> 01:49:26.751]  Gary Hart of the Hart-Rudman Commission.
[01:49:29.724 --> 01:49:34.747]  And boy, if I ever saw a criminal telegraph something like that, it was incredible.
[01:49:34.747 --> 01:49:39.951]  And then later, reporters repeatedly brought that up to him.
[01:49:39.951 --> 01:49:44.334]  And he would try to deny it on tape and start sweating really bad.
[01:49:44.334 --> 01:49:44.994]  It's crazy.
[01:49:44.994 --> 01:49:47.756]  It's crazy.
[01:49:47.756 --> 01:49:57.503]  I haven't made a film that that's in.
[01:49:57.503 --> 01:49:58.724]  I used to have a photographic memory.
[01:49:59.617 --> 01:49:59.857]  I'm 45.
[01:49:59.857 --> 01:50:01.398]  I've been through a lot.
[01:50:01.398 --> 01:50:02.639]  It doesn't work that good anymore.
[01:50:02.639 --> 01:50:06.201]  It was almost torture back when it was photographic.
[01:50:06.201 --> 01:50:08.643]  Up until I was about 35, it was pretty much photographic.
[01:50:08.643 --> 01:50:17.188]  Because I would see something or hear something, and then, like, this huge data spread would open up where I would remember everything at once.
[01:50:17.188 --> 01:50:18.489]  It was like, ah!
[01:50:18.489 --> 01:50:20.410]  Almost like being autistic or something.
[01:50:20.410 --> 01:50:21.831]  Because that's what autistic kids are like.
[01:50:21.831 --> 01:50:23.452]  It's just so much is happening.
[01:50:23.452 --> 01:50:24.193]  It just overwhelms them.
[01:50:24.193 --> 01:50:25.614]  It's just... But...
[01:50:26.621 --> 01:50:30.863]  Now I've got to kind of go back and remember, then I remember this, I remember that.
[01:50:30.863 --> 01:50:34.185]  But there's just so much these crooks have done, so you've got to pay attention to that.
[01:50:34.185 --> 01:50:38.307]  U-Haul, what's your other point on that?
[01:50:38.307 --> 01:50:48.552]  Yeah, one of the things about it is that even though it might seem like it's just a rumor, just an intention grabber, just a publicity stunt for something else, it's still just something to look at.
[01:50:48.552 --> 01:50:52.474]  Going back to before the break, the Oklahoma City building was evacuated.
[01:50:52.474 --> 01:50:55.415]  At least someone living in the city told me at the time, had a friend,
[01:50:55.987 --> 01:51:06.591]  Work there said that building was actually vacated prior to the Ryder truck, unfortunately, making its way in there, so... That's right, they used drills to get people out of the building to finish putting the bombs in.
[01:51:06.591 --> 01:51:09.592]  I've talked to folks that saw them in planning the bombs.
[01:51:09.592 --> 01:51:14.534]  And then later, Jane Graham would see them in that planned the bombs running the FBI press conference.
[01:51:14.534 --> 01:51:21.597]  She's like, that's the guys that were from the phone company putting in the gray sticks of butter.
[01:51:21.597 --> 01:51:21.737]  Right.
[01:51:22.182 --> 01:51:24.062]  Well, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:51:24.062 --> 01:51:24.903]  You're great.
[01:51:24.903 --> 01:51:25.423]  You're great.
[01:51:25.423 --> 01:51:26.883]  God bless you.
[01:51:26.883 --> 01:51:30.084]  Look, it's always good to be vigilant, and especially right now more than ever.
[01:51:30.084 --> 01:51:31.564]  Thank you so much.
[01:51:31.564 --> 01:51:34.285]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:51:34.285 --> 01:51:39.606]  Who was I saying I was going to go to next?
[01:51:39.606 --> 01:51:40.886]  There's so many.
[01:51:40.886 --> 01:51:43.207]  Let's go ahead and go to Patrick in Kansas.
[01:51:43.207 --> 01:51:44.047]  Patrick, you're on the air.
[01:51:44.047 --> 01:51:46.368]  Thank you for calling.
[01:51:46.368 --> 01:51:47.048]  Hey, Alex.
[01:51:47.048 --> 01:51:47.988]  It's nice talking to you.
[01:51:49.249 --> 01:51:50.370]  Hey, greetings from Kansas.
[01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:56.713]  I just wanted to say that it's pretty scary.
[01:51:56.713 --> 01:52:02.377]  Most people are completely, one, either unaware, or two, damaged.
[01:52:02.377 --> 01:52:09.701]  And the damage coming from the vaccinations, the 5G, everything.
[01:52:09.701 --> 01:52:11.242]  We need to focus on that.
[01:52:11.242 --> 01:52:18.466]  We're being attacked, we're being killed, and we're worrying about this peripheral nonsense that doesn't matter.
[01:52:20.423 --> 01:52:33.830]  I totally agree with you that IQs are dropping, cancer is off the chart, fertility is dropping, 90 plus percent of people's sperm is dead, and we are dying.
[01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:34.691]  We are being killed.
[01:52:34.691 --> 01:52:35.792]  The globalists are doing it on purpose.
[01:52:35.792 --> 01:52:37.092]  They are putting flora in the water.
[01:52:37.092 --> 01:52:38.773]  They admit it's killing us.
[01:52:38.773 --> 01:52:41.415]  And we're talking about is the raid real or isn't it real?
[01:52:44.343 --> 01:52:45.144]  You're absolutely right.
[01:52:45.144 --> 01:52:49.968]  It's just that with Trump, I believe it's real because what he's been doing is real.
[01:52:49.968 --> 01:52:51.630]  He's really been trying to get stuff done.
[01:52:51.630 --> 01:52:52.931]  Plus, he's surrounded by enemies.
[01:52:52.931 --> 01:52:56.895]  If he tried to stage something, even to end a war, it would still be immoral.
[01:52:56.895 --> 01:53:06.784]  But if he's putting a nice, you know, headstone on this war by saying al-Baghdadi's dead, if al-Baghdadi wasn't really dead, the deep state would expose that, wouldn't they?
[01:53:06.784 --> 01:53:08.505]  Because they'd want to hurt Trump.
[01:53:08.505 --> 01:53:09.506]  Oh, definitely.
[01:53:09.506 --> 01:53:10.147]  We want peace.
[01:53:10.717 --> 01:53:11.377]  We want peace.
[01:53:11.377 --> 01:53:11.977]  We're tired.
[01:53:11.977 --> 01:53:15.538]  We're tired of our kids going off and dying for pointless wars.
[01:53:15.538 --> 01:53:18.459]  How many of our kids has Trump sent off?
[01:53:18.459 --> 01:53:21.760]  How many fake wars has Trump started?
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:24.420]  The people know that he's for real.
[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:27.081]  The younger generation, not so much.
[01:53:27.081 --> 01:53:31.202]  We don't have much time left with them either.
[01:53:31.202 --> 01:53:32.542]  But we know.
[01:53:32.542 --> 01:53:33.682]  We can feel it.
[01:53:33.682 --> 01:53:34.463]  You can feel it.
[01:53:34.463 --> 01:53:36.023]  There's an energy in the air.
[01:53:36.533 --> 01:53:37.153]  We're good to go.
[01:54:00.911 --> 01:54:05.493]  I hope you have another special this Christmas with the water filters.
[01:54:05.493 --> 01:54:12.516]  I've got to say that's a great clarity that I haven't had before.
[01:54:12.516 --> 01:54:14.677]  Sometimes I regret being awakened.
[01:54:19.986 --> 01:54:23.629]  But other times I realize that this is all that's left.
[01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:34.857]  The biggest thing I noticed when Dr. Group got me, and he was developing X2 like 9 years ago, he said, listen Alex, you like the sun, you like to hike, you're an outdoorsman, he goes, you got sunspots.
[01:54:34.857 --> 01:54:40.360]  He said, take iodine consistently, a couple times a week at least, and your skin
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:43.302]  We'll clear up and those sunspots will go away.
[01:54:43.302 --> 01:54:44.864]  Well, supposedly sunspots don't go away.
[01:54:44.864 --> 01:54:47.547]  You've got to go ahead and remove them by a dermatologist.
[01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:50.551]  The things, 90% of them went away.
[01:54:50.551 --> 01:54:56.478]  I've got a couple pimples right now because of whatever reason I swam in a lake and must have had a high bacteria count.
[01:54:56.478 --> 01:54:59.562]  My wife and I both broke out a little bit from the lake.
[01:54:59.562 --> 01:55:00.182]  But other than that,
[01:55:00.703 --> 01:55:02.926]  I mean, I'm talking sunspots all over me.
[01:55:02.926 --> 01:55:06.250]  We go back like eight, nine years ago, and they're just gone.
[01:55:06.250 --> 01:55:08.612]  They just went away.
[01:55:08.612 --> 01:55:11.736]  And it's just wild.
[01:55:11.736 --> 01:55:14.799]  But again, China puts iodine in their water.
[01:55:14.799 --> 01:55:15.861]  Their IQ keeps going up.
[01:55:18.108 --> 01:55:20.089]  Our government tries to keep it away from us.
[01:55:20.089 --> 01:55:22.811]  And I saw a clip of Bill Gates talking about meeting Trump.
[01:55:22.811 --> 01:55:24.612]  And Trump's like, are vaccines really deadly?
[01:55:24.612 --> 01:55:25.292]  What do you think about them?
[01:55:25.292 --> 01:55:26.533]  And Gates is like, oh, no problem.
[01:55:26.533 --> 01:55:27.954]  Vaccines never hurt anybody.
[01:55:27.954 --> 01:55:30.536]  And then Bill Gates funded that TV show two weeks ago.
[01:55:30.536 --> 01:55:33.538]  The good doctor attacking me saying vaccines would never hurt anybody.
[01:55:33.538 --> 01:55:38.021]  The damn inserts say they can kill you and have all these side effects and don't protect you.
[01:55:38.021 --> 01:55:39.942]  I mean, it's just incredible what they're trying to sell.
[01:55:39.942 --> 01:55:42.884]  So great, great points, Patrick.
[01:55:42.884 --> 01:55:43.625]  You're absolutely right.
[01:55:45.014 --> 01:55:54.801]  That's why I just keep harping on, if we don't value human life, and if we don't realize people running things are psychotic, then we have no hope.
[01:55:54.801 --> 01:55:55.762]  And the public's so naive.
[01:55:55.762 --> 01:56:01.746]  We're going to release a video Wednesday that's about an hour long.
[01:56:01.746 --> 01:56:03.767]  And I went to the Texas Natural History Museum.
[01:56:03.767 --> 01:56:06.009]  It's now called the Texas Memorial Museum.
[01:56:06.009 --> 01:56:07.590]  It's a famous art deco museum.
[01:56:07.590 --> 01:56:07.650]  And
[01:56:13.049 --> 01:56:18.813]  I went to do a report there, and I had a couple graduate students walk over and go, gay frogs!
[01:56:18.813 --> 01:56:21.635]  So I started talking to them more, and they go, you're delusional.
[01:56:21.635 --> 01:56:24.998]  The Nazis weren't involved in the space program.
[01:56:24.998 --> 01:56:27.539]  And I'm showing them on my phone, and they're like, that's not true.
[01:56:27.539 --> 01:56:31.482]  And another professor walks over and goes, you're lying!
[01:56:31.482 --> 01:56:33.143]  And it's what the caller just said.
[01:56:33.143 --> 01:56:36.626]  These people are extremely stupid.
[01:56:38.288 --> 01:56:46.493]  And I'm not trying to be mean, but when I drive across UT or I go to other universities, but UT's giant, so I drive through it at least once a week, going places.
[01:56:46.493 --> 01:56:49.856]  Because, you know, unless you want to go around it, that would take 30 minutes.
[01:56:49.856 --> 01:56:56.900]  And I'm just like looking for healthy looking people, looking for smart looking people, looking for people that have like a spring in their step or a sparkle in their eye.
[01:56:56.900 --> 01:57:05.266]  And man, I don't care if they're white, black, Hispanic, male, female, they look like someone sucked their soul out.
[01:57:06.869 --> 01:57:09.372]  They look like a vampire, almost killed them.
[01:57:09.372 --> 01:57:11.974]  Drank like 90% of their blood.
[01:57:11.974 --> 01:57:16.759]  And... And then you talk to them, and man, they're dumb.
[01:57:16.759 --> 01:57:21.944]  I mean, and it's like, what is going on?
[01:57:21.944 --> 01:57:25.888]  Well, it's the TV culture, it's the chemicals, it's the glyphosate, it's the all of it!
[01:57:25.888 --> 01:57:27.109]  And it's killing us!
[01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:28.491]  And we physically know it is!
[01:57:30.643 --> 01:57:35.066]  I mean, I go out to Big Ben when there's no cell phones or anything, and I just, it's not just that I'm out in the desert.
[01:57:35.066 --> 01:57:36.487]  I sleep perfectly.
[01:57:36.487 --> 01:57:40.570]  I just, I'm there like five days, a year younger.
[01:57:40.570 --> 01:57:44.573]  And I've got to stay here in Austin and run this from the deck of this ship.
[01:57:44.573 --> 01:57:53.859]  And let me tell you, the elites are all fleeing to places like West Virginia, where the federal government has tens of thousands of square miles, where all radio frequency is outlawed.
[01:57:53.859 --> 01:57:54.780]  I'm telling you, it's incredible.
[01:57:55.896 --> 01:57:59.500]  InfoWars presents Alex Jones.
[01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:14.756]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious, came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies die in the womb, and it causes cancer.
[01:58:14.756 --> 01:58:17.379]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[01:58:17.839 --> 01:58:24.701]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[01:58:24.701 --> 01:58:33.305]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children.
[01:58:33.305 --> 01:58:39.007]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:39.007 --> 01:58:39.547]  Drink fluoride.
[01:58:40.247 --> 01:58:42.270]  Drink fluoride and die!
[01:58:42.270 --> 01:58:45.594]  Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and roll over!
[01:58:45.594 --> 01:58:49.138]  Do not visit InfoWarsTore.com and get high-quality iodine to counter it.
[01:58:49.138 --> 01:58:49.459]  No!
[01:58:49.459 --> 01:58:51.421]  Roll over and die, dirty Americans!
[01:58:57.461 --> 01:58:59.682]  It is now an admitted fact.
[01:58:59.682 --> 01:59:07.244]  Fluoride added to the water has caused tens of millions of Americans to be brain damaged and to have infertility and low IQs.
[01:59:07.244 --> 01:59:13.407]  And it doesn't matter if the Journal of American Medical Association comes out and says it's terrible, still the city's put it in the water.
[01:59:13.407 --> 01:59:17.508]  Because the ruling globalists want you and your family poisoned and stupid.
[01:59:17.508 --> 01:59:20.209]  And they sure don't want you to know about the good allergen.
[01:59:20.729 --> 01:59:29.773]  Iodine that absolutely increases IQ and fertility and makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything.
[01:59:29.773 --> 01:59:30.713]  Thank God!
[01:59:30.713 --> 01:59:31.413]  Thank God!
[01:59:31.413 --> 01:59:32.754]  I discovered this eight years ago.
[01:59:32.754 --> 01:59:36.075]  Of course, the enemy knows all about it and they hope you don't discover it.
[01:59:36.075 --> 01:59:37.796]  They hope you just roll over and die.

[01:59:55.423 --> 01:59:56.544]  Give in to Satan!
[01:59:56.544 --> 02:00:00.345]  Give in!
[02:00:00.345 --> 02:00:03.027]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:11.693 --> 02:00:16.995]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:16.995 --> 02:00:19.876]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.876 --> 02:00:28.060]  Alright, next segment I'm gonna go to Bo, I'm gonna go to Marcos, Justin, Isaiah, John, BW, and Mike.
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:34.102]  And speaking of Mike, Mike Adams is coming in here with some really big breaking news and some special guests.
[02:00:34.102 --> 02:00:37.624]  And so he'll be with me 30 minutes, but then he was gonna take over the fourth hour.
[02:00:38.894 --> 02:00:40.215]  I haven't gotten to the U.N.
[02:00:40.215 --> 02:00:43.598]  in Utah throwing people out of the building and saying the U.N.
[02:00:43.598 --> 02:00:44.459]  controls that area.
[02:00:44.459 --> 02:00:45.460]  This is actual video.
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:47.341]  They're not denying this.
[02:00:47.341 --> 02:00:50.644]  I haven't gotten to just a bunch of other news.
[02:00:50.644 --> 02:00:54.407]  Cringe pre-teen pussy scouts rap about racist dick Trump.
[02:00:54.407 --> 02:00:55.768]  We're going to play that.
[02:00:55.768 --> 02:01:02.974]  But first, this is really important and it funds our operation, but I want people to listen up because this product is about to sell out.
[02:01:02.974 --> 02:01:03.275]  Here it is.
[02:01:12.594 --> 02:01:13.875]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[02:01:13.875 --> 02:01:14.935]  Hey Alex!
[02:01:14.935 --> 02:01:16.276]  Oh my God!
[02:01:16.276 --> 02:01:19.257]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[02:01:19.257 --> 02:01:24.160]  Alex, I gotta tell you man, I don't care what anybody has ever said about you.
[02:01:24.160 --> 02:01:30.463]  You have re-appealed more human beings than anybody on planet Earth and God bless you.
[02:01:30.463 --> 02:01:32.724]  Everything you stand for, everything you've done.
[02:01:33.809 --> 02:01:35.191]  You are the best, man.
[02:01:35.191 --> 02:01:36.932]  I mean, it's the absolute truth.
[02:01:36.932 --> 02:01:42.438]  And when I heard you today with this live call, and you encouraged people to call in, I said, that's it, man.
[02:01:42.438 --> 02:01:43.339]  I'm just going to break down.
[02:01:43.339 --> 02:01:46.743]  I got to tell you, look, in January 2016, I went in the hospital.
[02:01:46.743 --> 02:01:50.887]  I went in the VA hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[02:01:50.887 --> 02:01:55.312]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to InfoWars
[02:01:56.133 --> 02:02:02.515]  Every day for three hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[02:02:02.515 --> 02:02:03.995]  Let me tell you something, man.
[02:02:03.995 --> 02:02:11.457]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[02:02:11.457 --> 02:02:13.217]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[02:02:13.217 --> 02:02:17.178]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[02:02:17.178 --> 02:02:19.839]  I'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense.
[02:02:19.839 --> 02:02:22.840]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff.
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:25.141]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[02:02:25.141 --> 02:02:25.681]  I got it.
[02:02:25.681 --> 02:02:27.262]  I hid it from the nurses.
[02:02:27.262 --> 02:02:28.302]  I started taking it.
[02:02:28.302 --> 02:02:30.723]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[02:02:30.723 --> 02:02:31.983]  It saved my life.
[02:02:31.983 --> 02:02:34.884]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[02:02:34.884 --> 02:02:45.488]  Listen, man, if there's any veteran out there, I don't care if you've traveled or anybody's traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense.
[02:02:45.488 --> 02:02:49.010]  Steve called in and was talking about, if he just joined us, how he was
[02:02:49.810 --> 02:02:52.572]  In the VA, really sick, nothing was working.
[02:02:52.572 --> 02:02:53.953]  He got a bottle of Living Defense.
[02:02:53.953 --> 02:03:00.518]  It doesn't just flush out the big parasites, it's designed to go after all the microscopic ones.
[02:03:00.518 --> 02:03:05.102]  And folks, this I thought would be our best-selling product.
[02:03:05.102 --> 02:03:12.748]  I mean, it sold some, but this is the strongest, best, natural, herbal compound that'll flush your guts out.
[02:03:13.706 --> 02:03:14.227]  Okay.
[02:03:14.227 --> 02:03:19.011]  Then we've got the mycoZX that gets out the candida, the mold, the yeast.
[02:03:19.011 --> 02:03:21.353]  If people take probiotics, that's great.
[02:03:21.353 --> 02:03:25.997]  You know, the good bacteria, because as you get older, a lot of the good bacteria are flushed out.
[02:03:25.997 --> 02:03:28.440]  You take antibiotics, it kills them all.
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:31.943]  There's other toxic bacteria, you know, that push out the good bacteria.
[02:03:31.943 --> 02:03:34.085]  So it's good to have things that are fermented.
[02:03:35.023 --> 02:03:38.765]  Or things that have a lot of natural bacteria, like yogurt, sauerkraut, pickles.
[02:03:38.765 --> 02:03:41.947]  Those are all great sources, naturally.
[02:03:41.947 --> 02:03:44.609]  But nothing works good like a good probiotic.
[02:03:44.609 --> 02:03:48.731]  You've got to have the other thing, like a micro-ZX that flushes out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:03:48.731 --> 02:03:52.474]  But then to go after parasites, well that's living defense.
[02:03:52.474 --> 02:03:56.196]  And so this is the best you're going to find out there that's over the counter.
[02:03:56.796 --> 02:04:11.186]  Okay, and if you go places, I don't want to be gross, but if you go places like Cuba, I've been told by everybody that goes there, most beautiful women you'd ever imagine, but they're begging for dewormer because the government won't produce it or sell it and people can't get it.
[02:04:11.186 --> 02:04:12.807]  And so people are taking dewormer.
[02:04:12.807 --> 02:04:17.810]  People go there with the dewormer and people just don't do anything for it.
[02:04:17.810 --> 02:04:21.773]  You know, case of cigars, women or whatever just for the dewormer.
[02:04:21.773 --> 02:04:22.714]  Pretty gross, right?
[02:04:22.714 --> 02:04:24.495]  That's how it is in communist countries.
[02:04:25.691 --> 02:04:32.317]  Well, there's all sorts of stuff out there that the medical system won't tell you about, and so we're not competing with their death traps and what they're doing.
[02:04:32.317 --> 02:04:34.578]  We're just saying, living defense.
[02:04:34.578 --> 02:04:43.866]  Well, Alex, I'm telling you, every listener out there should order a couple bottles of this, because everybody's got parasites, whether you think you don't or not.
[02:04:43.866 --> 02:04:48.090]  If you've ever eaten any kind of seafood, anything like that, obviously you do.
[02:04:48.090 --> 02:04:48.550]  Sushi?
[02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:49.131]  Forget about it.
[02:04:49.651 --> 02:04:57.542]  You're riddled with parasites and I don't know of a better product and I've done a lot of research since I had this miraculous turnaround in my health.
[02:04:57.542 --> 02:05:00.807]  I started looking into it and there's no better product out there.
[02:05:00.807 --> 02:05:02.068]  We're not making this up.
[02:05:02.068 --> 02:05:03.671]  Just like our information is game-changing.
[02:05:05.114 --> 02:05:07.135]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[02:05:07.135 --> 02:05:10.017]  I'm Wilbur Snakeland.
[02:05:10.017 --> 02:05:31.733]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro to the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[02:05:32.753 --> 02:05:44.696]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad.
[02:05:44.696 --> 02:05:48.037]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[02:05:48.037 --> 02:05:49.238]  There's no medical journals.
[02:05:49.238 --> 02:05:50.738]  There's no facts.
[02:05:50.738 --> 02:05:52.198]  You need fluoride.
[02:05:52.198 --> 02:06:01.001]  Just drink extra fluoride and then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[02:06:10.984 --> 02:06:15.626]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[02:06:15.626 --> 02:06:20.468]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:06:20.468 --> 02:06:23.249]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:23.249 --> 02:06:26.150]  Okay, let's move quick to get to a lot of your calls.
[02:06:27.352 --> 02:06:28.933]  Well, it's the U.N.
[02:06:28.933 --> 02:06:32.274]  now publicly saying it controls parts of the United States.
[02:06:32.274 --> 02:06:36.815]  Told you that a long time ago on my first film.
[02:06:36.815 --> 02:06:38.996]  Let's go to Bo in Kentucky, then Marcus in Texas.
[02:06:38.996 --> 02:06:41.217]  Bo, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:06:41.217 --> 02:06:42.837]  Hey Alex, how you doing buddy?
[02:06:42.837 --> 02:06:44.418]  Good brother, good to talk to you.
[02:06:44.418 --> 02:06:56.862]  Hey, I just wanted to say before I get started, I have your water filter and once a week I clean it and you should see the crud, the algae, just the rust particles and everything that come off of it.
[02:06:58.002 --> 02:07:00.864]  Thank you for that and I know that our family's drinking clear water.
[02:07:00.864 --> 02:07:01.584]  Well thank you sir.
[02:07:01.584 --> 02:07:20.155]  You know we were staying with some friends this weekend and my wife's like man the water coming out of the pipes stinks and you know she smelled my hair she goes yeah yours smells too and I said yeah honey that's why we've got filtration on the water in our shower I mean it's incredible what's in these municipal water supplies.
[02:07:20.155 --> 02:07:20.655]  Sorry go ahead.
[02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:25.606]  Yeah, and also I've been taking your X2, I just switched to the X3.
[02:07:25.606 --> 02:07:33.396]  Both your products make my hair grow thicker and my beard grow faster, and if I get a tear on my skin or anything like that, it heals overnight.
[02:07:33.396 --> 02:07:37.041]  It's amazing what iodine deficiency does to people, how bad it is.
[02:07:37.608 --> 02:07:38.328]  Yeah.
[02:07:38.328 --> 02:07:43.071]  So I've got a brother-in-law who watches, reads Newsweek, he reads Rolling Stones, and he's always talking.
[02:07:43.071 --> 02:07:46.392]  He's been just going off about the Trump impeachment and all this stuff.
[02:07:46.392 --> 02:07:52.015]  And I said, well, you saw Biden's CFR interview where he's bragging about holding back a billion dollars.
[02:07:53.129 --> 02:07:54.310]  Oh, of course!
[02:08:09.221 --> 02:08:11.623]  I'm like, you just see him saying it with his own word.
[02:08:11.623 --> 02:08:18.148]  It's like McCain when they got a picture of him and Al-Baghdadi laughing and joking in Syria.
[02:08:18.148 --> 02:08:19.409]  You know, we should have pulled that up.
[02:08:19.409 --> 02:08:22.091]  Guys, type in McCain with Al-Baghdadi.
[02:08:22.091 --> 02:08:25.093]  I mean, he's in those photos, Will Al-Baghdadi.
[02:08:25.093 --> 02:08:26.334]  It's like seven, eight years ago.
[02:08:26.334 --> 02:08:28.536]  His beard's not as long, but that's him, yeah?
[02:08:28.536 --> 02:08:33.820]  Yeah, and they claim, and that's the one that was eating the heart out of the guys, too, is in the video, too.
[02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:35.241]  You know, I've forgotten all that.
[02:08:35.241 --> 02:08:37.063]  Yeah, McCain went over there and said that he was the good guy.
[02:08:37.850 --> 02:08:38.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:08:38.730 --> 02:08:41.952]  So the real reason I'm calling you, I've got a major info coming in here.
[02:08:41.952 --> 02:09:04.424]  I've got a family member in California sending boxes of letters here to a person, a family member in Kentucky, hundreds of cards and letters addressed to individual people in Kentucky saying the governor has taken away their health care, that Trump's did this, Trump's did that, to their relative, please don't vote in the election for the governor or his attorney general.
[02:09:05.144 --> 02:09:09.386]  Oh yeah, the Democrats have gone from lying to creating giant hoaxes.
[02:09:09.386 --> 02:09:12.308]  So slow down and explain that.
[02:09:12.308 --> 02:09:19.851]  Everybody you know in Kentucky is getting bombarded with mail from California claiming all these horrible things the Republicans are doing.
[02:09:33.237 --> 02:09:37.501]  Well, sir, that's why everybody like you who hasn't been manned yet should start a YouTube channel.
[02:09:53.317 --> 02:10:03.780]  And just say, look at fake letters sent to Kentucky, fake veteran letters, and everyone has to expose that, or scan it and send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com because I'm aware of those type of dirty tricks.
[02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:11.642]  You know, that happened to me, where when they were really coming after me two years ago, hundreds of prominent preachers and people would get letters from Alex Jones
[02:10:12.262 --> 02:10:15.425]  Saying, F you, I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna hurt your family.
[02:10:15.425 --> 02:10:21.950]  And most of them figured it out, but others didn't and actually would freak out on us and I'd say, hey that's not me, I'd have to call them.
[02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:24.192]  Then they'd send me the info and I'd never written that.
[02:10:24.192 --> 02:10:29.536]  So yeah, dirty tricks are going absolutely crazy right now.
[02:10:29.536 --> 02:10:31.738]  Keep you up to good work, we're praying for you brother.
[02:10:31.738 --> 02:10:32.619]  God bless you.
[02:10:32.619 --> 02:10:38.504]  Hey guys, I really want to slow down on this because I said this last night on the show and I just said it right now.
[02:10:38.504 --> 02:10:40.065]  And I'm not mad at the crew, you guys are great.
[02:10:41.411 --> 02:10:43.852]  Just, I've really dropped the ball here.
[02:10:43.852 --> 02:10:48.734]  So let's just, stop.
[02:10:48.734 --> 02:10:50.014]  Rob Deu, he takes action.
[02:10:50.014 --> 02:10:52.775]  Somebody get me Rob Deu, please, or somebody like that.
[02:10:52.775 --> 02:10:57.417]  McCain openly posing photos with al-Baghdadi.
[02:10:57.417 --> 02:11:01.378]  And it came out in Congress, it came out like seven, eight years ago.
[02:11:01.378 --> 02:11:05.060]  And it's very, very, very important.
[02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:08.641]  There it is.
[02:11:08.641 --> 02:11:10.422]  Yep, that's al-Baghdadi, eight years ago.
[02:11:12.028 --> 02:11:13.229]  So I'm glad we put it up.
[02:11:13.229 --> 02:11:14.090]  Thank you.
[02:11:14.090 --> 02:11:15.431]  And we should be doing whole reports.
[02:11:15.431 --> 02:11:21.496]  But see, we have a tendency when we already know all this stuff, and it's eight years old, we're like, oh, that doesn't matter.
[02:11:21.496 --> 02:11:23.458]  No, what's old is new.
[02:11:23.458 --> 02:11:26.660]  Just because we all know this, you all know this, the general public doesn't.
[02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:33.146]  Just like that last caller, Bo, showed his family member what Biden said.
[02:11:33.146 --> 02:11:34.207]  He would never have seen that.
[02:11:35.267 --> 02:11:40.231]  When Trump ran an ad on Facebook saying that, Facebook banned it.
[02:11:40.231 --> 02:11:45.796]  And the news ran headlines saying Trump airs fake video.
[02:11:45.796 --> 02:11:52.161]  Just like when Acosta, Jim Acosta, grabs the mic from the girl.
[02:11:52.161 --> 02:11:53.182]  We just zoomed in on it.
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:56.202]  The media said it was fake.
[02:11:56.202 --> 02:11:58.404]  Trump said, that's not doctored, they just zoomed in on it.
[02:11:58.404 --> 02:11:59.825]  But that's the games they play.
[02:11:59.825 --> 02:12:02.147]  Oh, we're not going to show you this fake video.
[02:12:02.147 --> 02:12:05.830]  Just Alex Jones put a fake video out of Jim Acosta.
[02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:07.712]  It's so fake, we're not going to show it to you.
[02:12:07.712 --> 02:12:09.854]  Jones put out a fake video that Hillary fell down.
[02:12:09.854 --> 02:12:10.835]  She merely tripped.
[02:12:10.835 --> 02:12:13.197]  We're not going to show it to you, though.
[02:12:13.197 --> 02:12:16.320]  That's a sign you're being lied to, folks.
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:17.661]  She fell on her fat face.
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:25.102]  Let's go to John in Arkansas.
[02:12:25.102 --> 02:12:25.863]  John, you're on the air.
[02:12:25.863 --> 02:12:30.747]  Go ahead.
[02:12:30.747 --> 02:12:31.128]  Hi, John.
[02:12:31.128 --> 02:12:32.749]  How you doing today?
[02:12:32.749 --> 02:12:33.130]  Hey, Alex.
[02:12:33.130 --> 02:12:33.770]  How are you?
[02:12:33.770 --> 02:12:34.351]  I'm all right, brother.
[02:12:34.351 --> 02:12:35.712]  Go ahead.
[02:12:35.712 --> 02:12:39.976]  Yeah, I was just wondering if you saw those documents that got released last week.
[02:12:39.976 --> 02:12:43.820]  They were pretty interesting.
[02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:45.181]  Documents that got released last week.
[02:12:45.181 --> 02:12:45.662]  Tell me about it.
[02:12:46.576 --> 02:12:48.837]  It was about the Finders.
[02:12:48.837 --> 02:12:51.539]  It was a child sex cult back in the early 90s.
[02:12:51.539 --> 02:12:53.320]  Oh, I know what it is.
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:55.721]  Tell me about the documents that got released.
[02:12:55.721 --> 02:13:00.464]  Well, a couple of the documents are blueprints from the tunnels at the St.
[02:13:00.464 --> 02:13:03.146]  Martin Elementary School.
[02:13:03.146 --> 02:13:13.271]  And back then they claimed that they didn't exist, but there were, in the documents, there was people explaining going down in them and finding pentagrams and all other kinds of stuff.
[02:13:13.271 --> 02:13:13.692]  Oh, yeah.
[02:13:14.468 --> 02:13:15.468]  Do me a favor.
[02:13:15.468 --> 02:13:18.510]  That was the late, great Ted Gunnarsson's big work.
[02:13:18.510 --> 02:13:20.350]  Can you send me a link?
[02:13:20.350 --> 02:13:21.951]  Who found this?
[02:13:21.951 --> 02:13:22.811]  The sources.
[02:13:22.811 --> 02:13:24.272]  Give me the header.
[02:13:24.272 --> 02:13:27.373]  The FBI released them last week.
[02:13:27.373 --> 02:13:31.334]  The FBI released finders documents?
[02:13:31.334 --> 02:13:31.694]  Yeah.
[02:13:31.694 --> 02:13:33.595]  It's like 50 pages long.
[02:13:33.595 --> 02:13:35.456]  Okay, where did you read about it?
[02:13:35.456 --> 02:13:37.677]  What's the name of the article about it?
[02:13:37.677 --> 02:13:41.358]  I didn't see the article, but on Twitter, the FBI actually
[02:13:42.077 --> 02:13:43.058]  You know, we did it.
[02:14:00.006 --> 02:14:09.854]  And we've got to check our email and our show tips is most important that we all keep checking that because that's where just bombshells, bombshells, bombshells come in on that show tips.
[02:14:09.854 --> 02:14:13.498]  The problem is hundreds come in an hour so it becomes overwhelming.
[02:14:13.498 --> 02:14:19.042]  There it is, ex-FBI head Ted Anderson, satanic preschool tunnels.
[02:14:19.042 --> 02:14:22.846]  And he went down in them and I know that the FBI then sealed it.
[02:14:22.846 --> 02:14:26.529]  But what's really important is the Washington Times reported on it back in the day.
[02:14:28.630 --> 02:14:38.752]  Confirming that the CIA under the left was running it in DC with satellite uplinks for filming the child sex and snuff films.
[02:14:38.752 --> 02:14:42.913]  And he was the head FBI agent running all of Los Angeles sector.
[02:14:42.913 --> 02:14:48.474]  And all of this stuff came out and got exposed and he got basically fired over it because he wouldn't shut up.
[02:14:48.474 --> 02:14:54.196]  He was a great guy and all the stuff he talked about has now basically come out.
[02:14:54.196 --> 02:14:55.456]  But I remember him explaining
[02:14:57.827 --> 02:15:03.372]  How they believe they take the essence of the children when they torture them and then when they kill them.
[02:15:03.372 --> 02:15:12.261]  And that's the new Stephen King movie that's a... That's the movie coming out after The Shining.
[02:15:12.261 --> 02:15:15.524]  It's the... Yeah, Dr. Sleep.
[02:15:15.524 --> 02:15:17.446]  No, I know it's Dr. Sleep.
[02:15:17.446 --> 02:15:18.647]  I know it's Dr. Sleep.
[02:15:18.647 --> 02:15:20.548]  I'm trying to think.
[02:15:20.548 --> 02:15:22.610]  When something comes out before, it's called the prequel.
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:26.502]  When something comes, it's the sequel.
[02:15:26.502 --> 02:15:31.945]  You know, I'm gonna black out that window because it's crippled my show.
[02:15:33.104 --> 02:15:34.886]  That, and I love the crew.
[02:15:34.886 --> 02:15:42.712]  It's just, I made that realization a few weeks ago that I'm constantly getting distracted by that big fishbowl window with all them walking around in it.
[02:15:42.712 --> 02:15:45.895]  And how much I like the other studio because I wasn't looking at them.
[02:15:45.895 --> 02:15:47.736]  We're covering that window.
[02:15:47.736 --> 02:15:49.998]  Because, I mean, obviously I know what a sequel is.
[02:15:49.998 --> 02:15:52.360]  It's just that I'm trying to get this in line.
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:53.461]  I'm trying to get it ready.
[02:15:53.461 --> 02:15:56.564]  I want to roll the trailer to Dr. Sleep.
[02:15:56.564 --> 02:15:58.546]  I want to just direct all this.
[02:15:58.546 --> 02:16:01.248]  But that fishbowl's got goldfish going round and round.
[02:16:04.071 --> 02:16:05.332]  Maybe not today.
[02:16:05.332 --> 02:16:06.633]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:16:06.633 --> 02:16:10.375]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:10.375 --> 02:16:11.456]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:11.456 --> 02:16:13.277]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:16:13.277 --> 02:16:14.978]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[02:17:22.126 --> 02:17:30.011]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[02:17:30.171 --> 02:17:31.972]  Not a security IPO or note.

[02:17:46.623 --> 02:17:46.663]  800-600-3388.
[02:17:57.830 --> 02:18:16.141]  Again, I'm not talking down to the InfoWars audience, but I've been banging my head against the wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride, and I'm talking about iodine.
[02:18:16.141 --> 02:18:25.186]  Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an old Blastron boat, and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[02:18:26.241 --> 02:18:29.562]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live.
[02:18:29.562 --> 02:18:29.822]  Okay?
[02:18:29.822 --> 02:18:31.143]  It's the same thing.
[02:18:31.143 --> 02:18:34.204]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride.
[02:18:34.204 --> 02:18:37.065]  That's why, in every western nation, they put it in the water.
[02:18:37.065 --> 02:18:39.205]  They're going to teach us Christians to lay down and die.
[02:18:39.205 --> 02:18:41.026]  The Chai Kams don't put it in the water.
[02:18:41.026 --> 02:18:42.546]  They'd execute you if you did that.
[02:18:42.546 --> 02:18:50.069]  They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else.
[02:18:50.529 --> 02:18:54.453]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:54.453 --> 02:18:56.375]  We have all the documents and articles linked.
[02:18:56.375 --> 02:19:00.780]  And then get good iodine for yourself, because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:06.385]  Again, get iodine at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:06.385 --> 02:19:08.147]  Here are the facts.
[02:19:09.426 --> 02:19:18.509]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies including the American Medical Journal.
[02:19:18.509 --> 02:19:24.932]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility.
[02:19:24.932 --> 02:19:25.952]  That's the facts.
[02:19:26.232 --> 02:19:29.134]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[02:19:29.134 --> 02:19:32.236]  And then once you've learned about it, protect yourself and your family.
[02:19:32.236 --> 02:19:38.359]  The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine.
[02:19:38.359 --> 02:19:44.383]  In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people under their control.
[02:19:44.383 --> 02:19:46.544]  The globalists are targeting us here.
[02:19:46.544 --> 02:19:48.465]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:48.465 --> 02:19:52.267]  Experience iodine and biotruth selenium that goes with it together.
[02:19:52.267 --> 02:19:53.688]  And then once you see the great results,
[02:19:53.928 --> 02:19:54.988]  Warn others.
[02:19:54.988 --> 02:19:57.089]  This is the Achilles heel of the globalist.
[02:19:57.089 --> 02:19:58.330]  It's a win-win situation.
[02:19:58.330 --> 02:20:00.050]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[02:20:00.050 --> 02:20:07.873]  Take action now.
[02:20:07.873 --> 02:20:10.494]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:22.864 --> 02:20:34.367]  Well, I was reading it during the break, Alex Jones here back live, and it was just blowing me away.
[02:20:34.367 --> 02:20:36.107]  This is how much we've already printed.
[02:20:36.107 --> 02:20:42.209]  The last caller just brought this up, and I appreciate him calling in to tell me about it.
[02:20:42.209 --> 02:20:49.631]  Here is the FBI report on their investigation of just one satanic underground base.
[02:20:51.087 --> 02:20:55.949]  Where they were torturing the children and doing all of this.
[02:20:55.949 --> 02:20:59.291]  And sure enough, they've released it.
[02:20:59.291 --> 02:21:04.253]  And you heard the caller getting into what's in here.
[02:21:04.253 --> 02:21:06.535]  The pentagrams, all the stuff that was found.
[02:21:06.535 --> 02:21:08.976]  The fact that they were then ordered to cover it up.
[02:21:08.976 --> 02:21:10.897]  I'll have to dig out...
[02:21:18.683 --> 02:21:23.045]  Those interviews with Ted Gunderson and Erdos here, and it ties into the Franklin cover-up.
[02:21:23.045 --> 02:21:24.385]  Ties into Omaha, Nebraska.
[02:21:24.385 --> 02:21:26.926]  Ties into some really hardcore stuff.
[02:21:26.926 --> 02:21:29.608]  So, definitely by tomorrow's show.
[02:21:29.608 --> 02:21:35.210]  I was already planning today to get into Ritual Abuse of Children.
[02:21:35.210 --> 02:21:38.691]  And it's just something I didn't have time to do today.
[02:21:38.691 --> 02:21:42.313]  I saw the trailer for Doctor Sleep.
[02:21:42.313 --> 02:21:44.814]  I knew it was a Stephen King sequel to The Shining.
[02:21:46.186 --> 02:21:56.513]  Which Kubrick did a great job with, and I went and read about it, and that he cooked up the idea in 2006, wrote the book in 2013, and it's exactly what I'm telling you.
[02:21:56.513 --> 02:21:58.594]  They aren't real vampires.
[02:21:58.594 --> 02:22:06.380]  They believe they have spirits in them that have to suck the energy off children, or the spirits torment and basically kill the people that are possessed by them.
[02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:12.104]  And that's really what Satanists are, is there's these possessed people that have these entities in them that want to hurt children.
[02:22:12.104 --> 02:22:13.525]  And so I...
[02:22:14.915 --> 02:22:21.520]  Read the synopsis of the book and the film, and it's not even an allegory, it's what's going on.
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:40.393]  Then I had a chance to talk to Vivian Kubrick, who was obviously the protege of her father, his favorite, Stanley Kubrick, about the film, and the fact that he did Stephen King's novel, because he himself was obviously extremely psychic, Stanley Kubrick, and was clairvoyant, not just psychic.
[02:22:48.476 --> 02:22:50.237]  Not just empathic.
[02:22:50.237 --> 02:22:52.278]  So, believe me, everybody knows that stuff's real.
[02:22:52.278 --> 02:22:57.582]  There's just a lot of kooks and quacks that make money off of it to divert people off of what's really going on.
[02:22:57.582 --> 02:23:02.605]  But it's the kind of movies I can't watch, folks, because they particularly are looking for gifted children.
[02:23:02.605 --> 02:23:08.168]  And they believe they're siphoning off their essence.
[02:23:08.168 --> 02:23:10.189]  Not just your run-of-the-mill child.
[02:23:10.189 --> 02:23:10.890]  That's bad enough.
[02:23:10.890 --> 02:23:12.791]  It's just terrible.
[02:23:12.791 --> 02:23:14.472]  So, yeah, this stuff's all very real.
[02:23:16.403 --> 02:23:31.173]  Finders got busted because they caught members of the Finders driving a van with a bunch of naked, half-naked children on dirty mattresses in the back, four, five, six years old, driving down from Florida, and the plates went back to the facility they raided.
[02:23:31.173 --> 02:23:36.096]  It was a CIA facility in D.C., and they were filming snuff films, everything in there.
[02:23:36.096 --> 02:23:37.097]  I said I'd get to your calls.
[02:23:37.097 --> 02:23:39.699]  It's just that somebody raises something like this.
[02:23:39.699 --> 02:23:41.940]  This all came out.
[02:23:41.940 --> 02:23:44.622]  And I know this sounds horrible, and people don't want to believe it.
[02:23:44.622 --> 02:23:46.043]  Like Ted Gunnarsson didn't want to believe it.
[02:23:47.768 --> 02:23:50.171]  He was a senior FBI agent, just kept running into it.
[02:23:50.171 --> 02:23:52.834]  This stuff's real.
[02:23:52.834 --> 02:23:56.878]  And the Democratic Party basically runs off of it.
[02:23:56.878 --> 02:24:01.063]  And the so-called Republican leadership, a lot of them are into this as well, they're not really Republicans.
[02:24:01.063 --> 02:24:04.907]  And Trump is not part of this, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not part of this, and you're not part of this.
[02:24:04.907 --> 02:24:07.690]  We're saying no to it.
[02:24:07.690 --> 02:24:08.992]  Okay, who's been holding the longest now?
[02:24:16.929 --> 02:24:19.571]  I guess that'd be Clay in Kentucky.
[02:24:19.571 --> 02:24:21.413]  Clay, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:24:21.413 --> 02:24:23.375]  Thanks for calling.
[02:24:23.375 --> 02:24:25.417]  Yeah, am I on the air now?
[02:24:25.417 --> 02:24:26.037]  Yes, sir, you are.
[02:24:26.037 --> 02:24:27.539]  Thanks for calling.
[02:24:27.539 --> 02:24:28.159]  All right, well, cool.
[02:24:28.159 --> 02:24:29.881]  Thank you for taking my call, first off.
[02:24:29.881 --> 02:24:31.922]  And I just wanted to comment on the fact that you
[02:24:32.794 --> 02:24:38.618]  Earlier in the show, you made a comment about college students looking all zombie-like and whatnot on campus.
[02:24:38.618 --> 02:24:40.839]  Well, I'm a college student as well.
[02:24:40.839 --> 02:24:41.600]  I'm a junior.
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:46.703]  I'm studying English Literature and a minor in Creative Writing, so I am the real deal.
[02:24:46.703 --> 02:24:49.265]  And you are correct in stating that.
[02:24:49.265 --> 02:24:56.570]  When I first got here on campus way back when, it was like one of the first things I noticed is how everybody just looked rather zombie-like.
[02:24:56.570 --> 02:24:57.550]  They were rather pale.
[02:24:57.550 --> 02:24:59.051]  They were looking down while they walked.
[02:25:00.222 --> 02:25:01.723]  Well, I mean, honestly, I agree.
[02:25:01.723 --> 02:25:02.743]  They're a company.
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:40.187]  Sorry, I'm a little nervous, but they just, I mean, zombie-like, essentially, and I feel sorry for them and whatnot, because they have so much potential inside of them, yet they're not exactly harvesting it at the moment.
[02:25:40.187 --> 02:25:44.549]  And it seems this process is accelerating, and I'm not just picking on college students.
[02:25:44.549 --> 02:25:48.332]  You go a lot of places, and people look like somebody drained their soul off now.
[02:25:48.332 --> 02:25:50.513]  There's no fire in the eyes.
[02:25:50.513 --> 02:25:51.474]  There's no potential.
[02:25:51.474 --> 02:25:54.156]  Yeah, I kind of also see my parish a little bit.
[02:25:55.614 --> 02:25:57.115]  I go to church often.
[02:25:57.115 --> 02:25:58.956]  I see it amongst my parishioners.
[02:25:58.956 --> 02:26:03.859]  They're just kind of just sitting there quietly, you know, listening to mass and whatnot.
[02:26:03.859 --> 02:26:04.939]  I'll tell you what's going on.
[02:26:04.939 --> 02:26:07.341]  TV puts people in a trance.
[02:26:07.341 --> 02:26:10.763]  Now, television can also be used to get people into a heightened state of awareness.
[02:26:10.763 --> 02:26:14.425]  But, and that's what we're attempting to do here, just with straight shooting.
[02:26:14.425 --> 02:26:18.367]  But, the average person has been put into a trance.
[02:26:18.367 --> 02:26:20.528]  And they're shown so many simulated acts of violence.
[02:26:22.267 --> 02:26:26.448]  And they're showing so much garbage that they can't differentiate what's real from fiction.
[02:26:26.448 --> 02:26:27.269]  I appreciate your call.
[02:26:27.269 --> 02:26:28.029]  Thank you, Clay.
[02:26:28.029 --> 02:26:29.610]  Interesting point.
[02:26:29.610 --> 02:26:30.930]  Let's take another call here.
[02:26:30.930 --> 02:26:35.412]  Let's go ahead and talk to B.W.
[02:26:35.412 --> 02:26:35.972]  in Georgia.
[02:26:35.972 --> 02:26:37.112]  B.W., thanks for holding.
[02:26:37.112 --> 02:26:37.392]  Go ahead.
[02:26:37.392 --> 02:26:39.393]  All right.
[02:26:39.393 --> 02:26:40.273]  Can you hear me?
[02:26:40.273 --> 02:26:40.593]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:40.593 --> 02:26:42.014]  All right.
[02:26:42.014 --> 02:26:42.874]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:26:42.874 --> 02:26:44.455]  Good, brother.
[02:26:44.455 --> 02:26:45.495]  All right.
[02:26:45.495 --> 02:26:47.216]  Excuse me one second.
[02:26:47.216 --> 02:26:48.176]  It's more quiet.
[02:26:48.846 --> 02:26:49.546]  All right.
[02:26:49.546 --> 02:26:50.287]  Can you hear me?
[02:26:50.287 --> 02:26:50.807]  I sure can.
[02:26:50.807 --> 02:26:53.409]  All right.
[02:26:53.409 --> 02:26:54.109]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:26:54.109 --> 02:26:55.190]  I hope you're doing great.
[02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:56.451]  Well, I'm fighting the globalist, brother.
[02:26:56.451 --> 02:26:57.511]  I'm doing good talking to you.
[02:26:57.511 --> 02:26:58.352]  I'm above ground.
[02:26:58.352 --> 02:27:00.513]  Every day above ground is a good day.
[02:27:00.513 --> 02:27:01.774]  I know that's right.
[02:27:01.774 --> 02:27:08.058]  Well, I found out about you through TI's podcast as well, so I'm kind of new to this.
[02:27:08.058 --> 02:27:14.222]  I'm a military veteran, and I got a lot of things I got to ask you and also talk about.
[02:27:14.222 --> 02:27:16.243]  One is the raid thing.
[02:27:16.992 --> 02:27:19.132]  As, mind you, I'm African-American.
[02:27:19.132 --> 02:27:21.193]  I grew up in the Obama era.
[02:27:21.193 --> 02:27:24.714]  And I remember hearing about the Osama Bin Laden thing when I was in, like, high school.
[02:27:24.714 --> 02:27:28.514]  And I knew it was kind of iffy, but I still had the same questions that I had back then.
[02:27:28.514 --> 02:27:32.015]  Sure, what are your questions?
[02:27:32.015 --> 02:27:33.775]  The thing that I had was, what are we going to do now?
[02:27:33.775 --> 02:27:36.076]  Like, what's the next step?
[02:27:36.076 --> 02:27:37.356]  I don't care about what happened.
[02:27:37.356 --> 02:27:38.276]  I don't care how you die.
[02:27:38.276 --> 02:27:39.697]  What's the next step?
[02:27:39.697 --> 02:27:42.717]  Like, what are we going to do to afford ourselves?
[02:27:42.717 --> 02:27:45.998]  And, you know, Obama was going in on Osama Bin Laden and all that.
[02:27:46.835 --> 02:27:48.098]  Okay.
[02:27:48.098 --> 02:27:50.905]  When I found out it was fake, I was like, whatever, dude.
[02:27:50.905 --> 02:27:51.005]  It's...
[02:27:52.210 --> 02:27:52.650]  I don't care.
[02:27:52.650 --> 02:28:00.997]  That was more of just... Well, yeah, we've been lied to so much, I think it's very reasonable to investigate this, but I don't think Trump would knowingly lie about it.
[02:28:00.997 --> 02:28:07.962]  They might have done it in stages to frame him, but I tend to think it's probably real because Trump has been destroying ISIS, our military has.
[02:28:07.962 --> 02:28:10.524]  The globalists were actually helping create it.
[02:28:10.524 --> 02:28:18.750]  And so, to me, it just follows everything Trump's already done, and he's already delivered on so much he's done that I think it tends towards being very, very real.
[02:28:18.750 --> 02:28:19.150]  What do you think?
[02:28:21.812 --> 02:28:22.933]  I'm a little 50-50 on it.
[02:28:22.933 --> 02:28:25.236]  I want to say, yeah, it's cool.
[02:28:25.236 --> 02:28:33.205]  It's believable, but then I'm not the same time as... I'll say this, I don't think Trump's involved if it's staged.
[02:28:33.205 --> 02:28:35.047]  Yeah, I would say that.
[02:28:35.047 --> 02:28:41.535]  Maybe something more deeper than what he knows, but other than that, I couldn't say here nor there.
[02:28:43.815 --> 02:28:47.819]  I know you've got other questions, B.W., but I've got to race through the other callers.
[02:28:47.819 --> 02:28:50.422]  I'm going to come back to you briefly to get your next question.
[02:28:50.422 --> 02:28:54.206]  Mike Adams is coming in to tell you about the fourth hour he's hosting.
[02:28:54.206 --> 02:28:56.809]  Believe me, they're breaking massive news here.
[02:28:56.809 --> 02:28:58.971]  Vax 2, a huge new film.
[02:28:58.971 --> 02:28:59.832]  Vax 1 was giant.
[02:28:59.832 --> 02:29:00.693]  It's about to come out.
[02:29:00.693 --> 02:29:03.056]  You're getting a first look at this, and it's very important.
[02:29:03.866 --> 02:29:08.427]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:29:08.427 --> 02:29:10.508]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:10.508 --> 02:29:12.249]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:12.249 --> 02:29:18.791]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:18.791 --> 02:29:23.872]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:23.872 --> 02:29:28.574]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:29.014 --> 02:29:32.136]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[02:29:32.136 --> 02:29:39.141]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[02:29:39.141 --> 02:29:44.324]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[02:29:44.324 --> 02:29:47.626]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[02:29:47.626 --> 02:29:48.567]  Get clean.
[02:29:48.567 --> 02:29:50.408]  Call now and learn more.
[02:29:50.408 --> 02:29:50.448]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:54.411 --> 02:29:54.692]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:54.692 --> 02:29:54.892]  That's 800-506-6740.
[02:30:04.804 --> 02:30:08.407]  InfoWars presents Alex Jones.
[02:30:08.407 --> 02:30:23.661]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious, came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies die in the womb, and it causes cancer.
[02:30:23.661 --> 02:30:26.284]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[02:30:26.724 --> 02:30:33.607]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California unless it's part of adding fluoride.
[02:30:33.607 --> 02:30:42.212]  And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children.
[02:30:42.212 --> 02:30:47.934]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:47.934 --> 02:30:48.455]  Drink fluoride.
[02:30:49.155 --> 02:30:51.257]  Infowars.com forward slash show.

[02:31:10.515 --> 02:31:13.539]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[02:31:13.539 --> 02:31:17.964]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[02:31:17.964 --> 02:31:19.205]  If people didn't know
[02:31:19.906 --> 02:31:31.033]  That you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine, they might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[02:31:31.033 --> 02:31:36.416]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[02:31:36.416 --> 02:31:44.001]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[02:31:44.181 --> 02:31:45.082]  It's that simple.

[02:32:04.901 --> 02:32:11.024]  Now what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners.
[02:32:11.024 --> 02:32:12.284]  I'm just stating the facts.
[02:32:12.284 --> 02:32:13.485]  I own a chainsaw.
[02:32:13.485 --> 02:32:15.425]  I've had it since I was in college.
[02:32:15.425 --> 02:32:19.427]  And it's a great good old chainsaw and I've used it probably 500 times.
[02:32:19.427 --> 02:32:26.210]  But a few times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it.
[02:32:26.210 --> 02:32:28.331]  Now imagine if somebody told me to put
[02:32:29.091 --> 02:32:32.212]  Let's say superglue in the oil container on it.
[02:32:32.212 --> 02:32:33.632]  It would seize up forever.
[02:32:33.632 --> 02:32:35.432]  But only an evil person would do that.
[02:32:35.432 --> 02:32:38.393]  Well, fluoride's like putting superglue in a chainsaw.
[02:32:38.393 --> 02:32:39.613]  It's gonna make it seize up.
[02:32:39.613 --> 02:32:41.333]  And that's why they put it in the water.
[02:32:41.333 --> 02:32:43.534]  And they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family.
[02:32:43.534 --> 02:32:44.794]  Yes, they're really evil.
[02:32:44.794 --> 02:32:49.695]  Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication.
[02:32:49.695 --> 02:32:50.615]  It's that simple.
[02:32:50.615 --> 02:32:54.236]  I know you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late.
[02:32:54.236 --> 02:32:56.016]  It's part of the iodine conspiracy.
[02:32:56.016 --> 02:32:58.757]  Find out more at Infowarsstore.com and take action.
[02:32:58.897 --> 02:32:59.537]  We're good to go.
[02:33:26.112 --> 02:33:28.773]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:28.773 --> 02:33:35.736]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:33:35.736 --> 02:33:49.442]  Well, Nancy Pelosi's come out with other quote, top Democrats, and they're calling for an investigation that Trump didn't tell them about the al-Baghdadi raid.
[02:33:49.442 --> 02:33:52.703]  Well, number one, in an already authorized war zone,
[02:33:53.780 --> 02:34:03.094]  The President doesn't have to tell Congress anything until they have specific hearings and ask the Department of Defense questions about things that are already going on.
[02:34:04.329 --> 02:34:10.150]  But consistently, anything and everything the President does, they turn into a big, giant issue.
[02:34:10.150 --> 02:34:15.032]  We found the cure to cancer, they would attack him, many folks have said.
[02:34:15.032 --> 02:34:17.032]  And that is certainly true.
[02:34:17.032 --> 02:34:21.013]  But listen, I believe people have a right to question anything.
[02:34:21.013 --> 02:34:23.574]  And because we've been lied to so much about WMDs and
[02:34:25.610 --> 02:34:31.054]  The whole Smollett situation, the fake Kavanaugh things, people are saying maybe it's not real.
[02:34:31.054 --> 02:34:43.123]  I look at the compendium, though, of Trump trying to get us out, Trump exposing Hillary and Obama being behind the rise of ISIS as just a state for Al Qaeda, and the fact that he let the Turks come in and destroy them when they were in that little safe zone.
[02:34:43.123 --> 02:34:48.867]  This fits into everything Trump's been doing in his policy, and he knows the deep state's got agents everywhere.
[02:34:48.867 --> 02:34:51.089]  If he was going to stage something, which I don't think he'd do anyways,
[02:34:51.869 --> 02:34:54.210]  Why would he give them such dirt?
[02:34:54.210 --> 02:34:56.671]  Why would he get on the phone and say, I'm a businessman.
[02:34:56.671 --> 02:34:59.192]  You give me what I want, I give you a billion dollars.
[02:34:59.192 --> 02:35:00.432]  That would be illegal.
[02:35:00.432 --> 02:35:03.293]  Why in the hell would he didn't do it?
[02:35:03.293 --> 02:35:05.194]  That's why now the whistleblower won't even testify.
[02:35:05.194 --> 02:35:13.276]  And Mike Adams, a couple days into this, when it broke like five weeks ago, called me and he said, I think there isn't even a whistleblower.
[02:35:13.276 --> 02:35:15.977]  He said, it's just the same people that are putting out this info.
[02:35:15.977 --> 02:35:18.178]  So no one ever wants to say who the originator is.
[02:35:18.178 --> 02:35:19.418]  So it'll always be third hand.
[02:35:19.418 --> 02:35:20.619]  Well, now that's been confirmed.
[02:35:21.698 --> 02:35:23.219]  And I talked to sources in D.C.
[02:35:23.219 --> 02:35:24.019]  They said, how do you know that?
[02:35:24.019 --> 02:35:24.799]  Because that's what we think.
[02:35:24.799 --> 02:35:26.860]  I got a call the night after I was talking about it.
[02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:28.901]  I said, well, you didn't hear me say Mike Adams.
[02:35:28.901 --> 02:35:30.802]  So Mike's a smart cookie.
[02:35:30.802 --> 02:35:32.143]  He's going to host the fourth hour.
[02:35:32.143 --> 02:35:35.264]  I've invited him in here because we've got something really special for you.
[02:35:35.264 --> 02:35:38.586]  You know, Vax became a big international deal.
[02:35:38.586 --> 02:35:41.107]  People like De Niro was going to show it, then backed off.
[02:35:41.107 --> 02:35:42.708]  And Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:35:42.708 --> 02:35:43.308]  is helping it.
[02:35:43.308 --> 02:35:44.328]  I mean, it's been a huge story.
[02:35:44.328 --> 02:35:46.269]  It's been a huge hit despite the censorship.
[02:35:46.269 --> 02:35:47.530]  Vax 2 is coming out.
[02:35:48.507 --> 02:35:52.671]  You're gonna get a first look at it, the trailer, the producers, all of them coming on.
[02:35:52.671 --> 02:35:54.632]  This is powerful.
[02:35:54.632 --> 02:35:56.314]  Mike's gonna tell you about that next segment.
[02:35:56.314 --> 02:35:59.577]  I got a bunch of news to cover with him right now, but Mike...
[02:36:00.482 --> 02:36:02.704]  We haven't talked since, I guess, last week.
[02:36:02.704 --> 02:36:05.287]  So that nice text you sent me.
[02:36:05.287 --> 02:36:07.970]  So I don't even know your view on this.
[02:36:07.970 --> 02:36:13.956]  But boy, to see the mainstream media jump on him, say he's grandstanding, nothing compared to Obama.
[02:36:13.956 --> 02:36:15.357]  We knew the Obama raid was fake.
[02:36:15.357 --> 02:36:16.839]  We said it was fake before it happened.
[02:36:16.839 --> 02:36:19.742]  And then the Navy SEAL helicopter blows up with 23 of them on it.
[02:36:20.242 --> 02:36:21.724]  And I talked to people that knew those guys.
[02:36:21.724 --> 02:36:23.687]  They said that they never were sent on missions like that.
[02:36:23.687 --> 02:36:25.509]  They thought it was a setup.
[02:36:25.509 --> 02:36:26.670]  They weren't even given a pre-briefing.
[02:36:26.670 --> 02:36:31.096]  They said, get on this helicopter and then everybody saw it blow up when it got over the target.
[02:36:31.096 --> 02:36:36.723]  So we know that was fake because we had the founder of Delta Force on before it happened saying they're about to do this.
[02:36:37.424 --> 02:36:38.565]  Okay.
[02:36:38.565 --> 02:36:42.048]  I mean, that's how we know as our sources that have been proven to be right.
[02:36:42.048 --> 02:36:43.789]  But, Mike Adams, what's your view?
[02:36:43.789 --> 02:36:57.639]  Well, Trump was correct to withhold this information from these, I mean, let's be honest, treasonous traitors inside Congress who are enemies of America, who are enemies of freedom, enemies of, of course, the Trump administration.
[02:36:57.639 --> 02:37:03.464]  When people like Adam Schiff, when they weaponize information against the President and against the United States of America,
[02:37:04.224 --> 02:37:12.507]  Information cannot be trusted in their hands because they do not honor any civility, any due process, any rule of law.
[02:37:12.507 --> 02:37:14.967]  They are enemies of America, let's be honest.
[02:37:14.967 --> 02:37:17.888]  Adam Schiff should be- And they do evil things.
[02:37:17.888 --> 02:37:21.809]  They do evil things even when doing right would be good because it's their nature.
[02:37:21.809 --> 02:37:22.610]  Sorry to interrupt you.
[02:37:22.610 --> 02:37:23.290]  No, you're right.
[02:37:23.290 --> 02:37:24.590]  It is in their nature.
[02:37:24.590 --> 02:37:27.571]  They no longer have loyalty to this country.
[02:37:27.571 --> 02:37:32.333]  And this is also, look at the Washington Post, you know, honoring and celebrating this
[02:37:33.653 --> 02:37:38.057]  Oh yeah, why would they call him an austere religious monk, a great leader?
[02:37:38.057 --> 02:37:40.538]  Well, but it's very clear what their position is now.
[02:37:40.538 --> 02:37:48.004]  So Trump was, I believe, correct to keep this information close at hand and only with a close circle of trusted advisors.
[02:37:48.004 --> 02:37:49.665]  Well, remember those first few raids on leaders?
[02:37:49.665 --> 02:37:52.768]  They were always waiting for the troops now, because they were already leaking.
[02:37:52.768 --> 02:37:53.048]  Exactly.
[02:37:53.308 --> 02:37:53.988]  Exactly.
[02:37:53.988 --> 02:37:55.048]  Look, you just nailed it.
[02:37:55.048 --> 02:38:06.251]  I have no doubt that these people like Adam Schiff, in my opinion, I think that he leaks information to the enemies of America and puts American soldiers... We know Obama ran ISIS!
[02:38:06.251 --> 02:38:07.071]  Of course they did!
[02:38:07.071 --> 02:38:07.871]  Absolutely.
[02:38:07.871 --> 02:38:12.252]  Just like Senator Feinstein is a spy working for Communist China, in my view.
[02:38:12.252 --> 02:38:15.252]  It's come out, it's been confirmed, and it gets worse.
[02:38:15.252 --> 02:38:18.293]  That's why Pelosi calls MS-13 God's children, because they're working with her.
[02:38:18.293 --> 02:38:18.813]  Oh, exactly.
[02:38:18.993 --> 02:38:21.474]  Look, don't even get into California.
[02:38:21.474 --> 02:38:25.536]  It is a political cartel of gang members who have been elected to bosses.
[02:38:25.536 --> 02:38:27.756]  That is now literally him.
[02:38:27.756 --> 02:38:35.359]  Yeah, they are a political mafia cartel mob bosses who are complicit with the gangs and with the criminality of California.
[02:38:35.359 --> 02:38:43.843]  And by the way, speaking of California, think about not only are they shutting off the power to all the rural people in California, this is Agenda 21, which you've covered for years.
[02:38:43.843 --> 02:38:44.743]  They're making it unlivable.
[02:38:45.183 --> 02:38:55.428]  But also now, 350,000 Californians have had their fire insurance taken away because the insurance companies were, I believe, ordered to pull the fire insurance.
[02:38:55.428 --> 02:39:04.672]  So now you've got no electricity, your house is on fire, your business is on fire, you have no water because the water pumps require electricity, you have no fuel because the gasoline stations require it.
[02:39:04.672 --> 02:39:07.793]  And then all these mysterious fires keep popping up right when the winds are proper.
[02:39:07.793 --> 02:39:13.136]  Yeah, and you can't buy an AR-15, you can't get ammo without going through an FFL dealer.
[02:39:13.863 --> 02:39:19.611]  They are taking over rural California and kicking people out by burning them out!
[02:39:21.260 --> 02:39:25.321]  This is, there's so much more to this, Alex, that we could get into.
[02:39:25.321 --> 02:39:25.941]  This is Agenda 21.
[02:39:25.941 --> 02:39:28.522]  They're trying to corral all the Californians into the city.
[02:39:28.522 --> 02:39:29.322]  Look at the footage.
[02:39:29.322 --> 02:39:31.003]  I mean, it is just hell on earth.
[02:39:31.003 --> 02:39:38.225]  Yeah, and this is all, I mean, again, they can't control the winds, but the fact that the forests aren't allowed to be cleaned up.
[02:39:38.225 --> 02:39:40.585]  Well, it's plain, they don't put fire breaks in.
[02:39:40.585 --> 02:39:46.047]  You go anywhere else out in the country around the U.S., even if there's not power lines or pipelines, you'll see big, huge
[02:39:47.007 --> 02:39:53.775]  50 to 100 foot swaths cut, and you'll look, there's no underbrush allowed on the ground, because if lightning strikes, the whole county will burn down.
[02:39:53.775 --> 02:39:55.537]  They're called firebreaks.
[02:39:55.537 --> 02:39:58.640]  Right, and fire... But California hasn't had one since 1979.
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:02.784]  That's exactly right, and even the firefighters... 40 years!
[02:40:04.466 --> 02:40:07.749]  No, it's designed to go up in flames.
[02:40:07.749 --> 02:40:08.790]  It is a design.
[02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:15.757]  It's just like California and Venezuela was designed to have an economic collapse, to put people into poverty.
[02:40:15.757 --> 02:40:18.400]  Calizuela is next on the list.
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:20.342]  And then we say, okay, good, they deserve it.
[02:40:20.342 --> 02:40:23.324]  No, the people come here with the exact same mindset.
[02:40:24.145 --> 02:40:25.365]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:40:25.365 --> 02:40:36.168]  But look, getting back to al-Baghdadi and that whole situation, we can never trust these criminal traitors like Adam Schiff or Nancy Pelosi or Feinstein.
[02:40:36.168 --> 02:40:39.649]  We can never trust them with sensitive information, especially when the lives of U.S.
[02:40:39.649 --> 02:40:41.149]  troops are at stake.
[02:40:41.149 --> 02:40:45.270]  And we support all of you veterans, all of you active duty soldiers.
[02:40:45.270 --> 02:40:47.611]  We want you to be safe in your actions.
[02:40:48.491 --> 02:40:54.279]  Trump ordered actions and you will be compromised by the Democrats if the Democrats get a hold of that information.
[02:40:54.279 --> 02:40:55.560]  No question about it.
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:40:56.181]  That's right.
[02:40:56.181 --> 02:41:01.909]  Here's just some of the GOP presidential frontrunners saying he's a traitor, treason, arrest him, we want carbon taxes.
[02:41:01.909 --> 02:41:04.692]  These are literally enemies working with the globalists to collapse the country.
[02:41:04.692 --> 02:41:04.993]  Here they are.
[02:41:05.555 --> 02:41:08.356]  I believe Donald Trump is a traitor.
[02:41:08.356 --> 02:41:10.217]  And I'm speaking broadly.
[02:41:10.217 --> 02:41:15.719]  He broadly, he betrays this country every single day.
[02:41:15.719 --> 02:41:17.119]  Donald Trump is a traitor.
[02:41:17.119 --> 02:41:18.960]  He betrayed our elections.
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:24.922]  If you don't impeach him for that, you're telling future presidents
[02:41:25.922 --> 02:41:26.982]  That that's okay.
[02:41:26.982 --> 02:41:31.023]  This president betrayed our country again this week.
[02:41:31.023 --> 02:41:33.544]  And it's not the first time he did it.
[02:41:33.544 --> 02:41:37.605]  Excuse me, I don't know that we should move forward incrementally.
[02:41:37.605 --> 02:41:44.486]  This president needs to be impeached, Jake, just based on what he himself has said.
[02:41:44.486 --> 02:41:46.767]  And Republicans better get behind that.
[02:41:46.767 --> 02:41:51.048]  In your administration, does the Justice Department prosecute President Trump?
[02:41:52.392 --> 02:41:53.433]  Yes.
[02:41:53.433 --> 02:41:54.313]  Mark?
[02:41:54.313 --> 02:41:55.213]  Yes.
[02:41:55.213 --> 02:41:55.814]  Joe?
[02:41:55.814 --> 02:41:57.294]  Heck yes.
[02:41:57.294 --> 02:41:58.815]  That was easy.
[02:41:58.815 --> 02:42:02.957]  That's Governor Weld that said we need to kill Trump.
[02:42:02.957 --> 02:42:06.178]  And then I'm up there ABC News goes Alex Jones is making it up.
[02:42:06.178 --> 02:42:07.579]  No one's threatening to kill the president.
[02:42:08.872 --> 02:42:17.802]  There's been a big compilation of all the threats to kill the president and all the pop culture threats, you know, from Kathy Griffin holding up the decapitated head and so on.
[02:42:17.802 --> 02:42:24.629]  Let's not even debate that because it's all... But at a gut level, Trump hasn't been doing fake stuff, plus he wouldn't give Deep State something to set him up with.
[02:42:24.629 --> 02:42:27.331]  That means either the raid happened or they showed him fake footage.
[02:42:27.972 --> 02:42:30.454]  Well, exactly right.
[02:42:30.454 --> 02:42:33.736]  There's no question that Trump believes that that raid actually happened.
[02:42:33.736 --> 02:42:38.100]  Trump is not a guy who runs fake theater involving people's lives.
[02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:39.861]  He would never let hookers piss on him.
[02:42:39.861 --> 02:42:40.241]  No.
[02:42:40.241 --> 02:42:41.062]  He would not do anything.
[02:42:41.062 --> 02:42:42.463]  He's totally controlled.
[02:42:42.463 --> 02:42:43.264]  No.
[02:42:43.264 --> 02:42:44.204]  By controlled, I mean good.
[02:42:44.204 --> 02:42:45.645]  He's under his own control.
[02:42:45.645 --> 02:42:47.187]  He's all about being in command.
[02:42:47.987 --> 02:42:48.507]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:42:48.507 --> 02:42:50.168]  Not being shut up, not being manipulated.
[02:42:50.168 --> 02:42:52.048]  And he values the lives of U.S.
[02:42:52.048 --> 02:42:52.409]  troops.
[02:42:52.409 --> 02:42:56.130]  So let's make sure people understand Trump supports our veterans and supports our troops.
[02:42:56.130 --> 02:42:59.231]  He doesn't call them dumb animals like Obama reportedly got caught doing.
[02:42:59.231 --> 02:43:00.331]  We'll be right back with Mike Adams.
[02:43:00.331 --> 02:43:05.413]  Believe me, you cannot hype up enough how huge this is coming up next hour.
[02:43:05.413 --> 02:43:07.114]  Here are the facts.
[02:43:08.417 --> 02:43:17.504]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies including the American Medical Journal.
[02:43:17.504 --> 02:43:23.928]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility.
[02:43:23.928 --> 02:43:24.949]  That's the facts.
[02:43:26.590 --> 02:43:27.010]  I think?
[02:43:52.924 --> 02:43:53.965]  Warn others.
[02:43:53.965 --> 02:43:56.066]  This is the Achilles heel of the globalist.
[02:43:56.066 --> 02:43:57.287]  It's a win-win situation.
[02:43:57.287 --> 02:43:59.048]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[02:43:59.048 --> 02:44:03.832]  Take action now.
[02:44:03.832 --> 02:44:06.253]  Hello today on All Things Considered.
[02:44:06.253 --> 02:44:15.780]  I'm Wilbur Snakely here to tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[02:44:15.780 --> 02:44:19.583]  Now sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that
[02:44:20.083 --> 02:44:25.846]  It's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people?
[02:44:25.846 --> 02:44:26.746]  That's right.
[02:44:26.746 --> 02:44:28.627]  Drink the fluoride.
[02:44:28.627 --> 02:44:32.969]  Don't visit Infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen.
[02:44:32.969 --> 02:44:34.409]  I mean the bad halogen.
[02:44:34.409 --> 02:44:35.150]  Iodine.
[02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:37.911]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[02:44:38.671 --> 02:44:45.097]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us.
[02:44:45.097 --> 02:44:46.779]  We don't want to compete with you.
[02:44:46.779 --> 02:44:49.442]  Just drink the fluoride.
[02:44:49.442 --> 02:44:53.205]  Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do.
[02:44:53.205 --> 02:44:55.367]  Don't support Alex Jones.
[02:44:55.367 --> 02:44:59.791]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal.
[02:44:59.791 --> 02:45:01.933]  Oh, and let NAMBLA have access to your children.
[02:45:07.385 --> 02:45:08.646]  Hello, here.
[02:45:08.646 --> 02:45:10.627]  My name is Bethel.
[02:45:10.627 --> 02:45:13.468]  I work for my father, Lucifer.
[02:45:13.468 --> 02:45:18.211]  And he doesn't like the fact that God gave you all families and children.
[02:45:18.211 --> 02:45:23.094]  And so, we want to tell you something right now, Christian countries.
[02:45:23.094 --> 02:45:25.535]  We took control of you over a hundred years ago.
[02:45:25.535 --> 02:45:30.558]  We've been spiking your water with fluoride to lower your fertility and to hurt you.
[02:45:31.318 --> 02:45:42.851]  And it's worked so well, but now because of liability, and because of people warning inside the government what's happening, the Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done.
[02:45:42.851 --> 02:45:48.978]  And it makes me so angry, so whatever you do, just stay in that haze, and drink fluoride and give it to your children.
[02:45:51.207 --> 02:46:00.763]  And don't visit InfoWarsTore.com and learn about the iodine conspiracy and get 60% off on X2 and X3 together with BioCrew Selenium from the mustard seed.
[02:46:00.763 --> 02:46:01.545]  Submit to us!
[02:46:03.448 --> 02:46:05.510]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:05.510 --> 02:46:16.720]  Again, I'm not talking down to the Infowars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride, and I'm talking about iodine.
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:26.849]  Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an old Glastron boat, and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[02:46:26.849 --> 02:46:29.171]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live.
[02:46:30.137 --> 02:46:31.719]  Okay, it's the same thing.
[02:46:31.719 --> 02:46:34.783]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride.
[02:46:34.783 --> 02:46:37.647]  That's why in every western nation they put it in the water.
[02:46:37.647 --> 02:46:39.770]  They're going to teach us Christians to lay down and die.
[02:46:39.770 --> 02:46:41.612]  The Chai Kams don't put it in the water.
[02:46:41.612 --> 02:46:43.134]  They'd execute you if you did that.
[02:46:43.134 --> 02:46:45.017]  They put iodine in the water because
[02:46:45.077 --> 02:46:46.598]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:26.411 --> 02:47:30.633]  The origin of the HIV outbreak in the late 1970s, early 1980s.
[02:47:30.633 --> 02:47:32.674]  Mike Adams is going to get into that, too.
[02:47:32.674 --> 02:47:35.696]  It's actually on record.
[02:47:35.696 --> 02:47:38.357]  Governmental bioweapon program.
[02:47:38.357 --> 02:47:45.221]  And guess whose daddy was involved with the Army and Planned Parenthood in those programs?
[02:47:45.221 --> 02:47:47.282]  Well, his son founded Microsoft.
[02:47:48.962 --> 02:47:51.524]  So, really nice people, let me tell you.
[02:47:51.524 --> 02:47:54.487]  That is all coming up next hour.
[02:47:54.487 --> 02:47:56.228]  Vax 2, a first look.
[02:47:56.228 --> 02:47:58.610]  We got loaded phone lines here, and I want to get to some of these here.
[02:47:58.610 --> 02:48:05.737]  I was going to have Mike on just to prelude some of what was coming up, but I want to go to these calls as many as we can.
[02:48:05.737 --> 02:48:07.198]  We respect your calls.
[02:48:07.198 --> 02:48:08.139]  We appreciate your calls.
[02:48:08.139 --> 02:48:09.140]  In fact, there's so many of them.
[02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:10.100]  It's the problem sometimes.
[02:48:10.100 --> 02:48:14.584]  It's also a good problem to have, but I was asking during the break, as you see over the horizon quite a bit,
[02:48:15.545 --> 02:48:17.747]  What do you expect in the escalation of lies?
[02:48:17.747 --> 02:48:21.871]  Because they're clearly getting bigger, more Whopper-esque.
[02:48:21.871 --> 02:48:24.173]  What do you expect next from the Deep State?
[02:48:24.173 --> 02:48:39.686]  Well, what my sources are telling me, Alex, is that any documents that Adam Schiff and others can get their hands on, they will then go to town doing a Photoshop, counterfeit effort to make false documents such as, for example, Trump's tax returns.
[02:48:40.086 --> 02:48:44.791]  They will false- You mean somebody that reads false documents on air and has fake secret hearings?
[02:48:44.791 --> 02:48:45.672]  Yeah, fake transcripts.
[02:48:45.672 --> 02:48:47.555]  You mean he'll do it again?
[02:48:47.555 --> 02:48:53.141]  So remember Obama's birth certificate, how it was like 17 layers of Photoshop, they forgot to compress it, flatten the file?
[02:48:53.141 --> 02:48:54.062]  100% fact that that was fake!
[02:48:55.083 --> 02:48:56.424]  Yes, totally faked.
[02:48:56.424 --> 02:49:00.889]  They're going to fake Trump's tax returns, and they're going to put out the fake documents.
[02:49:00.889 --> 02:49:02.851]  The media will gaslight America.
[02:49:02.851 --> 02:49:04.953]  Trump will say, these aren't even real.
[02:49:04.953 --> 02:49:06.454]  They're completely faked.
[02:49:06.454 --> 02:49:08.176]  But CNN will say, no, they're real.
[02:49:08.176 --> 02:49:10.638]  We got them from Adam Schiff, or whoever.
[02:49:10.638 --> 02:49:18.085]  So they're going to start faking Trump's financial documents, and then say that he's a tax evader, and that he needs to be impeached for that reason.
[02:49:18.906 --> 02:49:26.738]  Make no mistake, Alex, anything that the left gets their hands on, they're going to go to town with Photoshop, they're going to fake everything, and they're going to create false narratives.
[02:49:26.738 --> 02:49:30.063]  Well, it's just like they're demonizing the raid when that's blowing over their face.
[02:49:30.063 --> 02:49:34.389]  They just, whatever the opposite of what Trump was doing, they do it.
[02:49:34.870 --> 02:49:35.751]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:49:35.751 --> 02:49:40.313]  Like you said, if Trump really announced a cure for cancer, they would attack it.
[02:49:40.313 --> 02:49:46.916]  And by the way, I'm getting lots of people who are talking about some real breakthroughs in low-cost energy.
[02:49:46.916 --> 02:49:57.102]  We're talking about low-energy nuclear reactions, LENR, that America could be the world leader, Trump could announce it, and it continues to be suppressed, but it's real.
[02:49:57.102 --> 02:50:00.163]  It used to be called cold fusion, but now it's low-energy nuclear reactions.
[02:50:00.163 --> 02:50:02.704]  It's been replicated in hundreds of labs all around the world.
[02:50:02.704 --> 02:50:03.245]  It's real.
[02:50:03.985 --> 02:50:06.068]  And America is about to lose its leadership.
[02:50:06.068 --> 02:50:08.491]  Well, it's like that Flans and Pies or whatever.
[02:50:08.491 --> 02:50:11.034]  They always put out a big hoax.
[02:50:11.034 --> 02:50:14.759]  Just like they say, everyone admits that vaccines causing damage was debunked.
[02:50:14.759 --> 02:50:16.181]  None of that was real.
[02:50:16.181 --> 02:50:16.842]  It's all a hoax.
[02:50:17.950 --> 02:50:24.092]  Yeah, well, and it was Fleischmann & Pons, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, I think 1989, when they announced that.
[02:50:24.092 --> 02:50:25.673]  A mayonnaise jar!
[02:50:25.673 --> 02:50:29.274]  I didn't mean to get off track on topics here, but, you know, look, that is real.
[02:50:29.274 --> 02:50:32.695]  We don't need new... Well, Mike, that's why you're always to come in and co-host.
[02:50:32.695 --> 02:50:34.496]  If you want your own show, please do it.
[02:50:34.496 --> 02:50:36.116]  We're gonna jam in a few calls here.
[02:50:36.116 --> 02:50:39.958]  We've got Marcus in Texas wants to talk about Kanye West.
[02:50:40.618 --> 02:50:42.259]  And the info war and the Trump raid.
[02:50:42.259 --> 02:50:54.247]  Yes, Kanye on Friday came out and talked about going to the Alex Jones level of things, and I really haven't talked about it because there's things more important than myself, but the fact that Kanye is getting into those waters is very, very interesting.
[02:50:54.247 --> 02:50:57.109]  And we've been close to having him on the show, so we want to get Kanye on the air.
[02:50:57.109 --> 02:50:59.070]  What's your view, Marcos?
[02:50:59.070 --> 02:51:09.056]  Well, I should have known that you already knew about it, that you already heard about it, but I just wanted, I mean, it was, I've been anticipating this Jesus is King album coming out, and I'm a big listener.
[02:51:09.056 --> 02:51:09.677]  I've listened for
[02:51:10.646 --> 02:51:17.549]  As long as I can remember, I went down to the Clinton protest with Owen down in Austin and stuff.
[02:51:17.549 --> 02:51:22.371]  But yeah, I'll let you talk about that next segment or something.
[02:51:22.371 --> 02:51:23.832]  Oh no, I'm glad you called in about it.
[02:51:23.832 --> 02:51:28.774]  In fact, we'll go back to you in a moment, but here's a clip of what Marcos is talking about.
[02:51:28.774 --> 02:51:31.075]  Here's Tanya West Friday.
[02:51:31.075 --> 02:51:32.916]  Are you afraid of losing your audience?
[02:51:32.916 --> 02:51:33.096]  Yay?
[02:51:33.996 --> 02:51:36.359]  I told you I'm only afraid of God.
[02:51:36.359 --> 02:51:38.722]  I'm only afraid of my daddy, God.
[02:51:38.722 --> 02:51:40.204]  I done been 15 years.
[02:51:40.204 --> 02:51:46.953]  I'm telling you, God is showing that you can have your own thoughts, bro.
[02:51:46.953 --> 02:51:49.656]  I've been canceled before there was canceled culture.
[02:51:49.656 --> 02:51:50.477]  Who told you
[02:51:51.701 --> 02:51:53.602]  That my career would be over.
[02:51:53.602 --> 02:52:01.568]  The same people that are telling you that you can't have a right to say who you will vote for, those people will be soon to take Jesus out the school.
[02:52:01.568 --> 02:52:08.112]  Those people will be soon to remove Jesus, period, from America, which is the Bible Belt.
[02:52:08.112 --> 02:52:10.254]  Those people will be soon... Man, come on, man.
[02:52:10.254 --> 02:52:12.555]  I ain't finna go Alex Jones level with y'all, man.
[02:52:12.555 --> 02:52:13.196]  Come on, man.
[02:52:13.196 --> 02:52:14.557]  What y'all... Like...
[02:52:15.819 --> 02:52:16.939]  Wake up!
[02:52:16.939 --> 02:52:18.200]  Wake up, Mr. West!
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:19.841]  Wake up, culture!
[02:52:19.841 --> 02:52:20.281]  Wake up!
[02:52:20.281 --> 02:52:24.342]  Everybody thinks they're so woke, but they're following the rules of what woke's supposed to be.
[02:52:24.342 --> 02:52:24.602]  Ha!
[02:52:24.602 --> 02:52:25.743]  He just nailed it!
[02:52:25.743 --> 02:52:27.664]  Yeah, a lot of folks are like, oh, he's fake.
[02:52:27.664 --> 02:52:29.264]  No, that's all real.
[02:52:29.264 --> 02:52:31.365]  And a lot of people say, oh, you've got to be perfect in your life.
[02:52:31.365 --> 02:52:32.225]  People talk about Jesus.
[02:52:32.225 --> 02:52:32.645]  No, no.
[02:52:32.645 --> 02:52:35.046]  I mean, they're coming after him.
[02:52:35.046 --> 02:52:36.327]  They're demonizing him everywhere right now.
[02:52:36.807 --> 02:52:42.471]  I love how you just said, people think they're so woke, they're just following the obedience rules of wokesterism, essentially.
[02:52:42.471 --> 02:52:44.893]  You're not woke if you're obedient.
[02:52:44.893 --> 02:52:47.195]  You're only woke if you're thinking outside the box.
[02:52:47.195 --> 02:52:50.858]  Absolutely, and all these folks just spouting the party line, it's idiotic.
[02:52:50.858 --> 02:52:51.959]  No, it's insane.
[02:52:51.959 --> 02:52:55.662]  And by the way, everything that people think they know about history has been faked.
[02:52:55.662 --> 02:53:00.405]  You know, planes falling out of the sky, they're not random bombings, they're taking out political operatives.
[02:53:00.405 --> 02:53:05.249]  You know, from 9-11, Waco, Oklahoma City, even the AIDS pandemic.
[02:53:05.769 --> 02:53:07.510]  The CDC was behind that as well.
[02:53:07.510 --> 02:53:09.091]  Oh, everybody knew that back at the time.
[02:53:09.091 --> 02:53:10.892]  I mean, my dad knew people in the government.
[02:53:10.892 --> 02:53:12.713]  I mean, I was like 10 years old.
[02:53:12.713 --> 02:53:14.034]  My dad goes, it's a bioweapon.
[02:53:14.034 --> 02:53:18.217]  The T-lymphocyte, it doesn't have receptor sites for Northern Europeans, but it does on Africans.
[02:53:18.217 --> 02:53:20.298]  It's a very specific weapon to target and depopulate Africa.
[02:53:20.298 --> 02:53:21.719]  Of course, later it was all, you know.
[02:53:22.199 --> 02:53:24.581]  Yeah, CDC needed funding just like any government agency.
[02:53:24.581 --> 02:53:31.587]  They created a giant false flag, you know, real casualties but false narratives so they could get more funding and then massive funding for this.
[02:53:31.587 --> 02:53:39.253]  And of course the virus mutates until it's not dangerous anymore and then that's where it supposedly went but they're always reapplying it through new vaccines.
[02:53:39.253 --> 02:53:42.115]  Right, like the polio vaccine now causes polio, right?
[02:53:42.115 --> 02:53:42.916]  This has come out.
[02:53:42.916 --> 02:53:45.378]  I mean NPR I heard was even talking about that over the weekend.
[02:53:45.458 --> 02:53:52.860]  And then Bill Gates runs around and goes, oh, there's only 50 cases worldwide, but there's hundreds of thousands of people that are paralyzed with polio-like.
[02:53:52.860 --> 02:53:54.440]  Right, which is the polio vaccine.
[02:53:54.440 --> 02:53:57.821]  So nearly all the cases of polio today are caused by the polio vaccine.
[02:53:57.821 --> 02:53:58.921]  And that's even admitted.
[02:53:58.921 --> 02:54:00.522]  It's openly admitted now.
[02:54:00.522 --> 02:54:05.103]  They're talking about they're going to have to have a vaccine to counter the polio vaccine's polio.
[02:54:05.743 --> 02:54:12.525]  So now, I mean, the vaccine... Did you see the Good Doctor episode, funded by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, it turned out?
[02:54:12.525 --> 02:54:14.206]  We talked about the time and said, oh look, his name's on it.
[02:54:14.206 --> 02:54:16.347]  No, he funded it, demonizing me.
[02:54:16.347 --> 02:54:16.647]  Oh, really?
[02:54:16.647 --> 02:54:19.187]  And saying vaccines have never hurt one person.
[02:54:19.187 --> 02:54:19.848]  Yeah.
[02:54:19.848 --> 02:54:20.588]  Never one person!
[02:54:20.588 --> 02:54:22.949]  No, it's insane.
[02:54:22.949 --> 02:54:31.011]  Right now, if vaccines were completely eliminated from society, we would have fewer deaths than we have today because of how dangerous vaccines are.
[02:54:31.011 --> 02:54:32.452]  Well sure, life expectancy's dropping.
[02:54:32.952 --> 02:54:35.696]  By the way, if you want the clip, it's like five minutes long, but they can queue it up shorter.
[02:54:35.696 --> 02:54:37.659]  I never got to it Friday, but it's pretty powerful.
[02:54:37.659 --> 02:54:39.461]  Zuckerberg got grilled about it.
[02:54:39.461 --> 02:54:43.708]  And the congressman goes, why are you censoring people criticizing mothers that have dead kids and stuff?
[02:54:43.708 --> 02:54:44.609]  Yeah.
[02:54:44.609 --> 02:54:47.152]  I mean, oh, well, that's false consumerism.
[02:54:47.152 --> 02:54:47.934]  Let people speak.
[02:54:48.868 --> 02:54:54.712]  Well, you know, we're going to be interviewing the producers of Vaxxed 2 here in the next hour, who are going to blow the lid on this.
[02:54:54.712 --> 02:54:57.014]  And they, what they have to share is bombshells.
[02:54:57.014 --> 02:54:57.374]  That's right.
[02:54:57.374 --> 02:54:58.815]  Start in the next hour, just a few minutes.
[02:54:58.815 --> 02:54:59.875]  And I'm sorry to all the other callers.
[02:54:59.875 --> 02:55:00.616]  I apologize.
[02:55:00.616 --> 02:55:01.457]  We'll get to you tomorrow.
[02:55:01.457 --> 02:55:03.278]  But Marcos, go ahead and finish up from Texas.
[02:55:04.580 --> 02:55:07.641]  Yeah, um, I just wanted to say I'm off the turbo force right now.
[02:55:07.641 --> 02:55:08.902]  I put it in the orange juice.
[02:55:08.902 --> 02:55:10.843]  Shout out to Will Johnson.
[02:55:10.843 --> 02:55:17.066]  Um, I want the crew to give themselves a hand, a round of applause, an actual one, because they don't want to see them clap anymore.
[02:55:17.066 --> 02:55:17.586]  Next caller.
[02:55:17.586 --> 02:55:18.446]  Oh yeah, I forgot.
[02:55:18.446 --> 02:55:18.906]  God bless you.
[02:55:18.906 --> 02:55:19.487]  I appreciate the call.
[02:55:19.487 --> 02:55:23.768]  Yeah, Oxford Bands clapping.
[02:55:23.768 --> 02:55:25.669]  So, OK symbol one week, now clapping.
[02:55:25.669 --> 02:55:30.111]  If we do a joke and say smiley faces, or white supremacists, you watch the ADL of Adam.
[02:55:30.111 --> 02:55:31.432]  And we'll go, yes, ADL!
[02:55:33.063 --> 02:55:34.303]  They will, yes.
[02:55:34.303 --> 02:55:37.204]  Guys, I'm not really plugged this hour.
[02:55:37.204 --> 02:55:39.225]  We're going to have to end the special this week.
[02:55:39.225 --> 02:55:41.626]  It's the Everything Must Go special.
[02:55:41.626 --> 02:55:46.288]  So many products are close to selling out that I'm going to have to end the Everything Must Go emergency sale.
[02:55:46.288 --> 02:55:47.808]  It's going to end probably Friday.
[02:55:47.808 --> 02:55:51.089]  We're going to announce the new specials by Friday, because I've got to.
[02:55:51.089 --> 02:55:53.190]  There's a bunch of stuff that's about to sell out.
[02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:55.231]  40 to 70% off, storewide free shipping, double Patriot points.
[02:55:56.091 --> 02:56:01.815]  Some of the specials are going to be able to stay like the one on the Alexa Pure Breeze, but we've sold half of those so far.
[02:56:01.815 --> 02:56:03.096]  That's at cost.
[02:56:03.096 --> 02:56:04.877]  Never at a deal at this price.
[02:56:04.877 --> 02:56:09.580]  The manufacturer's done it because they did an over-order and they want to be sold out by the end of the year.
[02:56:09.580 --> 02:56:11.942]  They want to guarantee that that's happened.
[02:56:11.942 --> 02:56:15.044]  So they had to put in their new orders to get them back in by early next year.
[02:56:15.044 --> 02:56:16.725]  People tend to buy the air filters in the springs.
[02:56:16.725 --> 02:56:17.966]  That's the whole reason they're doing it.
[02:56:17.966 --> 02:56:20.268]  You're getting them at cost because
[02:56:21.769 --> 02:56:26.934]  They're able to, again, do this deal to order more by getting their stock sold down because they want to pay tax at the end of the year.
[02:56:26.934 --> 02:56:27.774]  That's what it is.
[02:56:27.774 --> 02:56:30.056]  So that's at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:56:30.056 --> 02:56:32.158]  And it's your purchases that make it all possible.
[02:56:32.158 --> 02:56:34.861]  We also have the politically incorrect, it's okay to be okay.
[02:56:36.109 --> 02:56:40.193]  Black and white ball cap with Infowars.com on the back.
[02:56:40.193 --> 02:56:45.757]  It's a very handsome ball cap, and the way to say no to the thought police is to exercise your free speech.
[02:56:45.757 --> 02:56:49.981]  It's 33% off, because the cap costs us $10 to make.
[02:56:49.981 --> 02:56:53.664]  We have the Beto Not Shirt, 33% off.
[02:56:53.664 --> 02:56:54.825]  Better not try to take our guns.
[02:56:54.825 --> 02:56:57.007]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:56:57.007 --> 02:56:57.227]  And yes,
[02:57:01.815 --> 02:57:11.105]  I'd intended to sell out the Parasite Cleanze Living Defense by the end of the year, and we had it budgeted out very close to cost because we ordered a bunch of it at the start of the year.
[02:57:11.105 --> 02:57:16.590]  We sold a lot of it, but to make sure it all sold, we were selling it very, very close to cost.
[02:57:16.590 --> 02:57:18.072]  And then I noticed everybody was ordering it.
[02:57:18.072 --> 02:57:21.936]  Well, I said, I got to fund myself, but it's still 50% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:22.256 --> 02:57:27.958]  Ninety-ninety-five, living defense, and you heard the caller call in and talk about how it changed his life.
[02:57:27.958 --> 02:57:30.879]  And people went, wow, and bought a third of what's left last night.
[02:57:30.879 --> 02:57:31.299]  That's good.
[02:57:31.299 --> 02:57:32.860]  That helps fund the operation.
[02:57:32.860 --> 02:57:35.421]  But what we're making on this five bucks a bottle, really not that much.
[02:57:37.369 --> 02:57:39.991]  Take advantage of it, ladies and gentlemen, and just see what it does.
[02:57:39.991 --> 02:57:41.712]  All these herbs are good for you regardless.
[02:57:41.712 --> 02:57:45.514]  You're fighting the operation, so the only way you lose is not taking advantage of it.
[02:57:45.514 --> 02:57:49.537]  Mike Adams takes over with the folks from Vax2 the film.
[02:57:49.537 --> 02:57:51.358]  This is a major censored film.
[02:57:51.358 --> 02:57:54.120]  Please stay with us.
[02:57:54.120 --> 02:57:55.401]  It is now an admitted fact.
[02:57:56.337 --> 02:58:03.900]  Fluoride added to the water has caused tens of millions of Americans to be brain damaged and to have infertility and low IQs.
[02:58:03.900 --> 02:58:10.062]  And it doesn't matter if the Journal of American Medical Association comes out and says it's terrible, still the city's put it in the water.
[02:58:10.062 --> 02:58:14.144]  Because the ruling globalists want you and your family poisoned and stupid.
[02:58:14.144 --> 02:58:16.845]  And they sure don't want you to know about the good allergen.
[02:58:17.385 --> 02:58:26.428]  Iodine that absolutely increases IQ and fertility and makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything.
[02:58:26.428 --> 02:58:27.369]  Thank God!
[02:58:27.369 --> 02:58:28.069]  Thank God!
[02:58:28.069 --> 02:58:29.409]  I discovered this eight years ago.
[02:58:29.409 --> 02:58:32.730]  Of course, the enemy knows all about it and they hope you don't discover it.
[02:58:32.730 --> 02:58:34.431]  They hope you just roll over and die.
[02:58:34.431 --> 02:58:42.274]  So whatever you do, don't visit InfoWarsTore.com and get 60% off right now on the Wake Up the World to the Iodine Conspiracy Combo.

[02:58:48.216 --> 02:58:49.417]  Just give up America.
[02:58:49.417 --> 02:58:50.377]  Give up Christians.
[02:58:50.377 --> 02:58:52.078]  Drink your fluoride and die!
[02:58:52.078 --> 02:58:53.199]  Give in to Satan!
[02:58:53.199 --> 02:58:55.200]  Give in!
[02:58:55.200 --> 02:59:00.723]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[02:59:00.723 --> 02:59:03.765]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[02:59:03.765 --> 02:59:08.187]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[02:59:08.187 --> 02:59:14.791]  If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[02:59:15.251 --> 02:59:21.253]  They might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[02:59:21.253 --> 02:59:26.615]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[02:59:26.615 --> 02:59:34.217]  If you put the good allergen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[02:59:34.397 --> 02:59:35.297]  It's that simple.
[02:59:35.297 --> 02:59:41.499]  Find out about the Iodine Conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[02:59:41.499 --> 02:59:45.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research Iodine Deficiency.
[02:59:45.280 --> 02:59:47.220]  It's the key to everything.
[02:59:47.220 --> 02:59:57.382]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality Iodine and BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[02:59:57.382 --> 03:00:00.023]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.986 --> 03:00:13.230]  You found it.
[03:00:13.230 --> 03:00:15.255]  The tip of the spear.
[03:00:15.255 --> 03:00:19.807]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:00:36.391 --> 03:00:46.318]  And that's why I will not just shut up and dribble, because I mean too much to my two boys here, my wife, my family, and all these other kids that look up to me for inspiration.
[03:00:46.318 --> 03:00:47.999]  Oh, yeah!
[03:00:47.999 --> 03:00:49.721]  Love Long James!
[03:00:49.721 --> 03:00:53.563]  Oh, you are good!
[03:00:53.563 --> 03:00:58.127]  You told the Rockets that they're uneducated and stupid!
[03:01:00.279 --> 03:01:06.323]  But I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke.
[03:01:06.323 --> 03:01:13.208]  And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.
[03:01:13.208 --> 03:01:18.232]  Like the manager of the rockets that shipped in Hong Kong deserved freedom?
[03:01:18.232 --> 03:01:20.934]  No, that did people hurt.
[03:01:21.594 --> 03:01:32.084]  I can tell you by watching my broadcast, that is how you refer to the Americans as stupid, uneducated.
[03:01:32.084 --> 03:01:34.646]  LeBron James knows best.
[03:01:34.646 --> 03:01:39.090]  And now some evil Americans have said that he is bad.
[03:01:39.090 --> 03:01:41.952]  So he has said that he will no longer speak.
[03:01:41.952 --> 03:01:43.714]  Yes, yes!
[03:01:43.714 --> 03:01:44.335]  I'm talking about it now.
[03:01:44.975 --> 03:01:47.478]  And, uh, I probably won't talk about it again.
[03:01:47.478 --> 03:01:49.880]  LeBron, shut up and dribble.
[03:01:49.880 --> 03:01:55.405]  Oh, LeBron James has a mandate of heaven now.
[03:01:55.405 --> 03:01:56.066]  Oh.
[03:01:56.066 --> 03:02:03.713]  And frankly, this evening, I have a very special announcement to make to you stupid Americans.
[03:02:03.713 --> 03:02:06.076]  Winnie the Pooh was illegal.
[03:02:06.496 --> 03:02:15.440]  But now, after a long period of re-education, he is now ready to carry out his new job with a slave.
[03:02:15.440 --> 03:02:18.441]  I mean, good helper-servant.
[03:02:18.441 --> 03:02:22.963]  Here is LeBron James at the latest exhibition game, M.P.
[03:02:22.963 --> 03:02:24.784]  King.
[03:02:24.784 --> 03:02:29.106]  We have issued directives to NBA, what they ought to say.
[03:02:29.106 --> 03:02:31.027]  Hold on, I'm getting calls.
[03:02:31.027 --> 03:02:32.487]  Yes, what?
[03:02:32.487 --> 03:02:35.289]  Oh, Shaquille O'Neal say what?
[03:02:36.529 --> 03:02:38.430]  Show me, let me see.
[03:02:38.430 --> 03:02:42.031]  And one of our best values here in America is free speech.
[03:02:42.031 --> 03:02:47.793]  We're allowed to say what we want to say, and we're allowed to speak up about injustices, and that's just how it goes.
[03:02:47.793 --> 03:02:52.015]  And if people don't understand that, that's something that they have to deal with.
[03:02:52.015 --> 03:02:56.216]  Tamata need me going to Shakira!
[03:02:59.139 --> 03:03:04.242]  You're the bad American, and we will teach you soon.
[03:03:04.242 --> 03:03:07.424]  Antifa is preparing to rise up.
[03:03:07.424 --> 03:03:11.967]  With Deep State, we have paid well.
[03:03:11.967 --> 03:03:15.169]  And don't give your visit man down in hell.
[03:03:15.169 --> 03:03:16.510]  We'll have to kill you.
[03:03:18.123 --> 03:03:23.905]  You live and work in a state in which the majority of voters voted for the current president.
[03:03:23.905 --> 03:03:32.589]  How do you reconcile having called that choice a mistake that many of those people are also Cavaliers fans?
[03:03:32.589 --> 03:03:34.529]  Well, I mean, that's a great question.
[03:03:34.529 --> 03:03:43.413]  At the end of the day, like I said, you can
[03:03:46.730 --> 03:03:48.231]  I don't think a lot of people was educated.
[03:04:34.997 --> 03:04:36.558]  All right, we're about to go to break shortly.
[03:04:36.558 --> 03:04:39.561]  This is Mike Adams filling in here for the fourth hour.
[03:04:39.561 --> 03:04:47.647]  And when we come back from this real quick break, we're going to be interviewing people who have created the new film Vax 2 at vax2.com.
[03:04:47.647 --> 03:04:49.769]  That's the numeral 2.
[03:04:49.769 --> 03:04:52.811]  And we will have some explosive interview information when we return.
[03:04:52.811 --> 03:04:53.272]  Stay with us.
[03:04:53.272 --> 03:04:53.832]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:05:02.987 --> 03:05:05.109]  Welcome back to NPR here today.
[03:05:05.109 --> 03:05:07.891]  I'm Wilbur Snakeland.
[03:05:07.891 --> 03:05:29.591]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro to the show and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[03:05:30.611 --> 03:05:42.580]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad.
[03:05:42.580 --> 03:05:45.902]  Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[03:05:45.902 --> 03:05:47.123]  There's no medical journals.
[03:05:47.123 --> 03:05:48.604]  There's no facts.
[03:05:48.604 --> 03:05:50.065]  You need fluoride.
[03:05:50.065 --> 03:05:58.871]  Just drink extra fluoride and then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[03:06:06.799 --> 03:06:13.846]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Mike Adams.
[03:06:13.846 --> 03:06:16.649]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:20.843 --> 03:06:33.093]  Today, having been in clinical practice for over 30 years, that the children I see today are sicker than they were when I was a resident.
[03:06:33.093 --> 03:06:37.597]  Actor Robert De Niro has reversed course in a highly controversial documentary film.
[03:06:37.597 --> 03:06:42.742]  This prestigious Tribeca Film Festival will no longer feature a film called Vaxxed.
[03:06:42.742 --> 03:06:44.543]  They've never confronted anything like this before.
[03:06:44.543 --> 03:06:47.866]  They've never had to deal with a film like this, and they censored it.
[03:06:48.633 --> 03:06:50.994]  And the censorship caused it to explode.
[03:06:50.994 --> 03:06:54.315]  De Niro initially defended the decision to screen the film at Tribeca.
[03:06:54.315 --> 03:07:00.236]  But after mountain pressure over the weekend, the decision was made to cancel the screening.
[03:07:00.236 --> 03:07:05.657]  Getting a bus of some kind to travel on the ground, to be with the people, was the way to go forward.
[03:07:05.657 --> 03:07:10.359]  What we found out very quickly was that parents wanted to tell their story.
[03:07:10.359 --> 03:07:11.799]  There was lines of people.
[03:07:11.799 --> 03:07:15.240]  All they wanted to do was talk about the injury that happened to them.
[03:07:15.740 --> 03:07:21.263]  All he wanted to do was go in his room and sit on his bed and bang his head against the wall.
[03:07:21.263 --> 03:07:25.585]  When we set out on the road to record stories, we were in for much more than we bargained for.
[03:07:25.585 --> 03:07:28.226]  We were about to have an education that you just couldn't buy.
[03:07:28.226 --> 03:07:31.347]  This is just the biggest lie ever told.
[03:07:31.347 --> 03:07:38.751]  Nobody in their right mind would ever take this vaccine if they actually read the clinical literature.
[03:07:38.751 --> 03:07:43.333]  This has actually been proven that these vaccines cause cardiovascular instability.
[03:07:43.755 --> 03:07:44.956]  And these infants.
[03:07:44.956 --> 03:07:47.599]  It causes death and they admit it.
[03:07:47.599 --> 03:07:53.205]  Those injured families, you have to appreciate what you've done.
[03:07:53.205 --> 03:07:59.491]  Sharing your stories on watch, sharing your stories on the VAX bus has grown a movement.
[03:07:59.491 --> 03:08:02.934]  After his 12 month vaccines, he's lost eye contact.
[03:08:02.934 --> 03:08:05.937]  Like an idiot, I went back for his 15 month vaccines and
[03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:08.722]  He completely stopped talking.
[03:08:08.722 --> 03:08:12.024]  He couldn't crawl anymore or talk anymore.
[03:08:12.024 --> 03:08:13.966]  He couldn't eat anymore.
[03:08:13.966 --> 03:08:15.508]  He couldn't swallow.
[03:08:15.508 --> 03:08:18.770]  Screaming and you could tell they were in so much pain.
[03:08:18.770 --> 03:08:20.012]  Now he has seizures.
[03:08:20.012 --> 03:08:22.374]  He's almost died on me several times.
[03:08:22.374 --> 03:08:23.875]  It was a people's story.
[03:08:23.875 --> 03:08:27.098]  Their story is the same over and over and over again.
[03:08:36.263 --> 03:08:49.150]  It's a bombshell new documentary Vax 2 just being released and we have here in InfoWars Studios the exclusive interview with the producer, executive director and other people involved in this film.
[03:08:49.150 --> 03:08:50.531]  We'll be going to them in just a second here.
[03:08:50.531 --> 03:08:51.672]  I just want to set the tone here.
[03:08:52.412 --> 03:08:55.534]  There is a war against our children in America.
[03:08:55.534 --> 03:09:02.399]  It's a chemical war, and the weapons are chemical violence weapons, which are called vaccines.
[03:09:02.399 --> 03:09:06.161]  You're being lied to about vaccines in every way by the establishment.
[03:09:06.161 --> 03:09:07.302]  The CDC is lying.
[03:09:07.302 --> 03:09:08.503]  The mainstream media is lying.
[03:09:08.503 --> 03:09:13.946]  You know, your doctors are not informed of the truth about what's really in these vaccines.
[03:09:13.946 --> 03:09:21.772]  And so the first Vax film, which was a huge success, the level of censorship that was directed against that film was just
[03:09:22.612 --> 03:09:23.352]  It was unbelievable.
[03:09:23.352 --> 03:09:24.493]  They tried to shut it down everywhere.
[03:09:24.493 --> 03:09:26.573]  They threatened certain theaters and so on.
[03:09:26.573 --> 03:09:32.835]  So, of course, the creators of that film decided that this is such an important message, they have to create a follow-up film.
[03:09:32.835 --> 03:09:33.675]  It's called Vaxxed 2.
[03:09:33.675 --> 03:09:36.696]  The website for that is vaxxed2.com.
[03:09:36.696 --> 03:09:37.936]  That's the numeral 2.
[03:09:37.936 --> 03:09:40.196]  V-A-X-X-E-D-2.com.
[03:09:40.196 --> 03:09:42.797]  It's opening in theaters all across the country soon.
[03:09:42.797 --> 03:09:48.258]  And we have with us today, I'll start with Polly Tommy, who is the creator of this film.
[03:09:48.258 --> 03:09:48.818]  Welcome, Polly.
[03:09:48.818 --> 03:09:49.479]  It's great to have you here.
[03:09:49.479 --> 03:09:50.099]  Thank you.
[03:09:50.099 --> 03:09:50.659]  Thank you for having us.
[03:09:50.979 --> 03:10:01.072]  And we've also got Toby Tommy here with us as well who is on the younger side and he has been reaching out to the youth in America who are also waking up to the vaccine issue.
[03:10:01.072 --> 03:10:01.833]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:10:01.833 --> 03:10:02.954]  Thanks for having me.
[03:10:02.954 --> 03:10:04.176]  It's great to have you both here today.
[03:10:04.176 --> 03:10:05.177]  Let's go to you Polly first.
[03:10:05.177 --> 03:10:05.317]  Tell us
[03:10:07.088 --> 03:10:11.734]  I mean, privately, you were telling me that it's like a war zone out there.
[03:10:11.734 --> 03:10:12.755]  Tell me more about that.
[03:10:12.755 --> 03:10:15.198]  What's really happening to our children across America?
[03:10:15.198 --> 03:10:18.903]  Okay, so first of all, my son was injured by the MMR.
[03:10:18.903 --> 03:10:20.665]  That's all he had that morning.
[03:10:20.665 --> 03:10:24.871]  So I've been for 20 years, a big campaign on watch this vaccine.
[03:10:25.191 --> 03:10:26.552]  Let's give you seizures.
[03:10:26.552 --> 03:10:38.316]  So when we finished the first Vax film and we started traveling around promoting that, parents would come up to me in their droves, because my son's story was in that first film, and say, I need to talk to you.
[03:10:38.316 --> 03:10:40.117]  I need to tell you what happened to me.
[03:10:40.117 --> 03:10:44.978]  So when we got this bus and went out on the road... It was a nationwide tour, the Vax bus tour.
[03:10:44.978 --> 03:10:46.499]  Yeah, we never really planned it.
[03:10:46.499 --> 03:10:48.440]  It just sort of evolved.
[03:10:48.440 --> 03:10:53.862]  So we went out on this bus and I thought I was going to get a lot of MMR autism stories, because that's all I knew.
[03:10:54.682 --> 03:10:58.164]  But wasn't literally day two, we hit our first Gardasil story.
[03:10:58.164 --> 03:11:00.845]  And once we did our first Gardasil, we hit our first baby story.
[03:11:00.845 --> 03:11:03.667]  And then they came in their droves, dead babies.
[03:11:03.667 --> 03:11:06.148]  It's like a war zone.
[03:11:06.148 --> 03:11:12.691]  It was like, it was just a bloody battlefield out there of massive death and destruction.
[03:11:12.691 --> 03:11:13.872]  And we're talking about America.
[03:11:14.292 --> 03:11:18.617]  So wait a minute, because according to the mainstream media, that doesn't exist.
[03:11:18.617 --> 03:11:25.044]  There are no parents like that with vaccine-damaged children that they would say that you're making it up.
[03:11:25.044 --> 03:11:32.411]  But what you're telling us and what's in the film are, I guess, you must have spoken with thousands of parents along the way, huh?
[03:11:32.411 --> 03:11:32.752]  Thousands.
[03:11:32.952 --> 03:11:42.699]  And here's the thing, I think the parents are hugely, I'm trying to think of the right word without swearing right now, because what's happened to us is our most precious possessions in our lives.
[03:11:42.699 --> 03:11:45.981]  We research everything when we have a baby.
[03:11:45.981 --> 03:11:48.823]  And we trusted the medical professionals.
[03:11:48.823 --> 03:11:56.049]  All of us, all of these parents that vaccinated now have injured children like mine, or dead children, we trusted were pro-vaccine.
[03:11:56.869 --> 03:12:01.172]  So that's incredibly important, and I think that the lies came from the media.
[03:12:01.172 --> 03:12:03.754]  You know, we turn on the television and it's, they're safe and effective.
[03:12:03.754 --> 03:12:06.477]  Doctor after doctor after doctor telling us this.
[03:12:06.477 --> 03:12:13.362]  So that's why it was important for us to get out on the bus, on the roads of America, and actually speak to the parents ourselves.
[03:12:13.362 --> 03:12:14.663]  What is out there?
[03:12:14.663 --> 03:12:15.944]  What are we dealing with?
[03:12:15.944 --> 03:12:18.326]  But wait a minute, the left-wing media says...
[03:12:18.846 --> 03:12:23.671]  That Trump is evil because he's separating children from families at the border.
[03:12:23.671 --> 03:12:29.337]  Or they go crazy about children in Syria or Afghanistan or Turkey or places like that.
[03:12:29.337 --> 03:12:35.624]  But America's children are being, in essence, assaulted through vaccines and killed.
[03:12:36.510 --> 03:12:36.950]  That's it.
[03:12:36.950 --> 03:12:38.130]  Killed and maimed.
[03:12:38.130 --> 03:12:40.851]  Killed, but the deaths, this is what we couldn't believe.
[03:12:40.851 --> 03:12:43.931]  I have never seen so much death.
[03:12:43.931 --> 03:12:54.233]  There is every single stop, we had at least one dead baby, a garter saw death, paralysis from the waist downwards, untold damage.
[03:12:54.233 --> 03:12:56.454]  Vaccines are killing America.
[03:12:56.454 --> 03:12:59.454]  That is what the people of America will tell you, the vaccinated.
[03:12:59.454 --> 03:13:03.495]  So, I mean, these, was it mostly mothers, or mothers and fathers, or...
[03:13:04.875 --> 03:13:07.078]  I mean, they must have been coming to you with tears in their eyes.
[03:13:07.078 --> 03:13:08.540]  I can't even imagine.
[03:13:08.540 --> 03:13:15.950]  Look, when you look into the eyes of a parent whose child is brain damaged like mine or dead from a vaccine, their soul's broken.
[03:13:15.950 --> 03:13:17.312]  It's ripped from them.
[03:13:17.312 --> 03:13:18.453]  It is the most painful.
[03:13:18.453 --> 03:13:20.616]  You can feel it as they come towards you, the pain.
[03:13:21.297 --> 03:13:28.105]  When an unvaccinated family with a beautiful, healthy children will get onto that in a minute, come towards you, you see joy and light and love.
[03:13:28.105 --> 03:13:29.706]  Everything is great in their eyes.
[03:13:29.706 --> 03:13:31.889]  Right, but that's what they want to take away from children.
[03:13:31.889 --> 03:13:36.273]  And it's all about brainwashing, not just today's adults, but also our youth.
[03:13:36.273 --> 03:13:38.656]  Toby, going to you on this point, since you're...
[03:13:39.557 --> 03:13:43.400]  You're of the age that a lot of people your age are totally brainwashed pro-vaccine.
[03:13:43.400 --> 03:13:44.060]  Right.
[03:13:44.060 --> 03:13:52.546]  But are you seeing some awakening now among America's youth who are beginning to question the system and actually get really woke on the issue of vaccines?
[03:13:52.546 --> 03:13:53.967]  No.
[03:13:53.967 --> 03:14:04.934]  My generation is so quick just to trust their doctors and they're so caught up with social media and what social media makes of people who are against vaccination that they don't think twice.
[03:14:06.115 --> 03:14:12.157]  They need to look at what is really going on out there, and that's what this film shows.
[03:14:12.157 --> 03:14:15.658]  But you're saying that they have been successfully brainwashed and obedient?
[03:14:15.658 --> 03:14:15.818]  100%.
[03:14:15.818 --> 03:14:16.938]  Yeah.
[03:14:16.938 --> 03:14:20.960]  So you don't see anybody your age that is questioning this system?
[03:14:20.960 --> 03:14:21.600]  Not enough.
[03:14:21.600 --> 03:14:22.200]  Not enough.
[03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:28.182]  The amount of damage we're seeing compared to the people that are choosing not to vaccinate and the health out there, it's undeniable.
[03:14:28.592 --> 03:14:37.997]  What do you think about the idea that vaccines cause so much neurological damage in children that it makes people unable to think for themselves and question the vaccine narrative itself?
[03:14:37.997 --> 03:14:39.778]  I think that's probably a good point.
[03:14:39.778 --> 03:14:43.920]  So there are lobotomies being carried out through vaccines?
[03:14:43.920 --> 03:14:44.080]  Right.
[03:14:45.430 --> 03:14:46.871]  You would agree with that as well?
[03:14:46.871 --> 03:14:48.312]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[03:14:48.312 --> 03:15:02.820]  Can I just say, Toby told me that when he signed on for college, one of his best friends, I'm not going to mention his name, Toby, the college is saying, right, Texas, you have to have, it's mandatory that you have the following vaccines, meningitis, whatever they are.
[03:15:02.820 --> 03:15:03.180]  Toby's right.
[03:15:04.141 --> 03:15:04.781]  Absolutely not.
[03:15:04.781 --> 03:15:05.903]  Here's my religious exemption.
[03:15:05.903 --> 03:15:08.766]  And his friend's like, oh, I can't be bothered.
[03:15:08.766 --> 03:15:16.675]  It's much easier for me to sign the form that says I'll have it than to go through that boring procedure that will take five minutes.
[03:15:16.675 --> 03:15:18.537]  Because they can't be bothered because they don't get it.
[03:15:18.677 --> 03:15:23.041]  It's just easier for them to conform and just surrender to the vaccine agenda.
[03:15:23.041 --> 03:15:27.145]  Because nobody's told them, guess what mate, you can actually die from that vaccine.
[03:15:27.145 --> 03:15:29.467]  That's not me being a conspiracy theorist.
[03:15:29.467 --> 03:15:31.629]  Here's the insert, death is there.
[03:15:31.629 --> 03:15:37.996]  This is a good friend of mine as well and he knows the story of Billy and my brother and what happened to him with vaccines and he knows how
[03:15:38.796 --> 03:15:43.960]  Against it I am, and I gave him the briefing and said, look man, you can just sign this exemption form.
[03:15:43.960 --> 03:15:45.341]  We're about to go to break, Toby.
[03:15:45.341 --> 03:15:48.043]  Continue that thought when we come back.
[03:15:48.043 --> 03:15:57.890]  But children across America are being harmed, maimed, and killed by vaccines, and we've got the people right here who are breaking the new documentary, Vax2.com.
[03:15:57.890 --> 03:15:59.171]  Stay with us, we'll be back after this break.
[03:16:01.761 --> 03:16:07.046]  One of the most frequently asked questions we get in customer service is, what is the Real Red Pill?
[03:16:07.046 --> 03:16:09.148]  And what is the Real Red Pill Plus?
[03:16:09.148 --> 03:16:15.074]  Well, Real Red Pill is a vitamin, mineral, multivitamin, high quality with preglanone.
[03:16:15.074 --> 03:16:21.420]  Real Red Pill Plus is the same thing with a little bit of clean added energy on top of it as well.
[03:16:21.420 --> 03:16:23.081]  That kicks in in 30 minutes.
[03:16:23.081 --> 03:16:26.264]  But the preglanone kicks in in about a week or so.
[03:16:27.245 --> 03:16:29.387]  Folks, look into preglanone for yourself.
[03:16:29.387 --> 03:16:39.776]  Look into high-end sources of it, like Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus, and then you'll definitely want to try it out and see the effects you get within about seven days to two weeks, generally.
[03:16:39.776 --> 03:16:41.718]  But believe me, it's a missing link.
[03:16:41.718 --> 03:16:42.738]  You need to find out about it.
[03:16:43.519 --> 03:16:45.621]  As we age, preglanone levels go down.
[03:16:45.621 --> 03:16:49.805]  All of our hormones in our body are manufactured by the body using preglanone.
[03:16:49.805 --> 03:16:56.292]  You need to learn about preglanone and then you need to get the Real Red Pill or the Real Red Pill Plus.

[03:17:38.181 --> 03:17:41.022]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[03:17:41.022 --> 03:17:41.683]  Awesome.
[03:17:41.683 --> 03:17:44.765]  No refrigeration needed with a 10 year shelf life.
[03:17:44.765 --> 03:17:46.326]  NASA PAC Technology.

[03:17:51.108 --> 03:17:52.549]  Or warm and serve.
[03:17:52.549 --> 03:17:54.570]  Life saving, ready to eat bacon.
[03:17:54.570 --> 03:17:56.531]  10 year shelf life bacon.

[03:17:59.313 --> 03:18:00.554]  Fullycookedbacon.com.
[03:18:02.972 --> 03:18:05.173]  It is now an admitted fact.
[03:18:05.173 --> 03:18:12.756]  Fluoride added to the water has caused tens of millions of Americans to be brain damaged and to have infertility and low IQs.
[03:18:12.756 --> 03:18:18.918]  And it doesn't matter if the Journal of American Medical Association comes out and says it's terrible, still the city's put it in the water.
[03:18:18.918 --> 03:18:23.000]  Because the ruling globalists want you and your family poisoned and stupid.
[03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:25.701]  And they sure don't want you to know about the good allergen.
[03:18:26.241 --> 03:18:35.285]  Iodine that absolutely increases IQ and fertility and makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything.
[03:18:35.285 --> 03:18:36.225]  Thank God!
[03:18:36.225 --> 03:18:36.925]  Thank God!
[03:18:36.925 --> 03:18:38.266]  I discovered this eight years ago.
[03:18:38.266 --> 03:18:41.567]  Of course, the enemy knows all about it and they hope you don't discover it.
[03:18:41.567 --> 03:18:43.288]  They hope you just roll over and die.
[03:18:43.288 --> 03:18:51.511]  So whatever you do, don't visit importwarsstore.com and get 60% off right now on the Wake Up the World to the Iodine Conspiracy Combo.

[03:18:57.074 --> 03:18:58.255]  Just give up, America.
[03:18:58.255 --> 03:18:59.235]  Give up, Christians.
[03:18:59.235 --> 03:19:00.937]  Drink your fluoride and die!
[03:19:00.937 --> 03:19:02.037]  Give in to Satan!
[03:19:02.037 --> 03:19:02.978]  Give in!
[03:19:02.978 --> 03:19:11.265]  But, as you know, there's been a long-term look at, look-see, and it looks like it's becoming very serious from what I'm hearing.
[03:19:11.265 --> 03:19:13.947]  Investigate the investigators.
[03:19:13.947 --> 03:19:20.672]  Whether it's Strzok and Page, whether it's Flapper and whether it's Comey and all of these people.
[03:19:21.650 --> 03:19:24.491]  Because terrible things went on for our country.
[03:19:24.491 --> 03:19:26.612]  You just heard the President.
[03:19:26.612 --> 03:19:33.014]  The investigation is criminal, it's very serious, and what is about to come out is going to shock the world.
[03:19:33.014 --> 03:19:39.976]  And InfoWars was there before it all happened, telling you it was coming, if we just continue to expose these criminals.
[03:19:39.976 --> 03:19:42.377]  And we'll be there while it unfolds.
[03:19:42.377 --> 03:19:46.118]  And we'll be there, thanks to your support, when the enemy strikes back.
[03:19:46.118 --> 03:19:49.959]  This is an ongoing battle, and your support is now more critical than ever.
[03:19:50.379 --> 03:19:56.046]  I leave it all up to the people that are working with the Attorney General, who I don't know.
[03:19:56.046 --> 03:19:59.570]  But I will say this, I think you'll see things that nobody would have believed.
[03:19:59.570 --> 03:20:06.197]  This was the worst hoax in the history of our country.
[03:20:06.197 --> 03:20:08.881]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.941 --> 03:20:25.743]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:20:25.743 --> 03:20:37.645]  Just as InfoWars is the most banned news network in America, this film, Vax 2, will likely become the most censored, the most aggressively banned documentary in history.
[03:20:37.645 --> 03:20:42.986]  And in fact, there are so many threats against this film and the venues that dare to show it.
[03:20:43.846 --> 03:20:55.575]  That we can't even tell you where it's playing yet, that information is only being released 24 hours before it starts to show, because there have been so many threats against these venues that dared to show the film.
[03:20:55.575 --> 03:21:06.344]  And Toby here, who worked on the film as part of the executive producer team, tell us, what parts of the country, how many theaters and so on, where can people, how can people even see this film?
[03:21:06.864 --> 03:21:11.166]  So November 6th we're doing a nationwide People's Premiere.
[03:21:11.166 --> 03:21:16.909]  There's currently over a hundred different screenings and that's still growing and will continue to grow until the 6th.
[03:21:16.909 --> 03:21:29.575]  You can go to vax2.com under the tickets tab and you can see wherever the film is going to be shown, all the cities, 24 hours before the date the theatre will get released.
[03:21:29.575 --> 03:21:32.297]  But you can go there, check out all the screenings and get your tickets.
[03:21:32.757 --> 03:21:34.918]  And the name of the film in the theaters?
[03:21:34.918 --> 03:21:36.059]  Vax 2, The People's Truth.
[03:21:36.059 --> 03:21:37.100]  No, it's People's Truth.
[03:21:37.100 --> 03:21:38.581]  We had to take Vax 2 out.
[03:21:38.581 --> 03:21:40.442]  Oh, I was just about to talk about it.
[03:21:40.442 --> 03:21:47.826]  The People's Truth is the name of the film, folks, because they couldn't even show the film with the word Vax as the title.
[03:21:47.826 --> 03:21:51.949]  So, I mean, think about the level of censorship and suppression of this message.
[03:21:51.949 --> 03:21:52.889]  It's incredible.
[03:21:52.889 --> 03:21:55.511]  So again, go to Vax2.com to find out where it's showing.
[03:21:55.511 --> 03:21:57.032]  How many theaters roughly across the country?
[03:21:57.532 --> 03:21:58.693]  We're hoping for around 150.
[03:21:58.693 --> 03:22:00.515]  150 for the opening?
[03:22:00.515 --> 03:22:01.336]  For the opening night.
[03:22:01.336 --> 03:22:02.176]  OK.
[03:22:02.176 --> 03:22:07.741]  And I know you're going to, we're going to show you a clip from the film, not right this minute, but coming up here.
[03:22:07.741 --> 03:22:23.836]  Polly, have you ever, you know, 10 years ago, before all you got into doing this film, did you ever think that the level of censorship and suppression of truth in America would reach the level that we're seeing today, where they're just trying to completely destroy a film that tells the truth about children being damaged?
[03:22:23.916 --> 03:22:24.957]  No, it's outstanding.
[03:22:24.957 --> 03:22:28.399]  And here is the thing that people have got to think about.
[03:22:28.399 --> 03:22:30.580]  Just think about this, if nothing else.
[03:22:30.580 --> 03:22:32.121]  Why are they censoring this?
[03:22:32.121 --> 03:22:36.944]  You can tell on Netflix or Amazon, you'll see all kinds of crazy stuff that should be censored in my mind.
[03:22:36.944 --> 03:22:37.224]  Yeah.
[03:22:37.224 --> 03:22:41.667]  But this is the people talking about their experiences that did vaccinate.
[03:22:41.667 --> 03:22:43.268]  Not an anti-vaccine film, is it?
[03:22:43.268 --> 03:22:44.329]  Because we all vaccinated.
[03:22:44.329 --> 03:22:47.151]  No, it's a vaccine results film.
[03:22:47.151 --> 03:22:48.952]  It's called X-Factors.
[03:22:48.952 --> 03:22:49.152]  Right.
[03:22:49.732 --> 03:22:54.473]  So, but basically, we're just, we're trying to, it's parents warning other parents and they want to silence it.
[03:22:54.473 --> 03:22:55.773]  They've taken us off Facebook.
[03:22:55.773 --> 03:22:57.074]  We can't go live.
[03:22:57.074 --> 03:23:01.915]  They have shut us in every single way, but they won't win because it's the parents carrying it.
[03:23:01.915 --> 03:23:09.797]  But isn't it fascinating, the parents who came up to you with their stories of their children being damaged by vaccines, as you mentioned, they used to all be pro-vaccine.
[03:23:09.797 --> 03:23:11.357]  They went out and got their children vaccinated.
[03:23:12.878 --> 03:23:15.060]  But this, it's got to be tough for them.
[03:23:15.060 --> 03:23:18.362]  I mean, it must be destroying the lives of the parents as well as the children.
[03:23:18.362 --> 03:23:20.224]  Is that what you've seen?
[03:23:20.224 --> 03:23:25.949]  What we've seen is, anybody who thinks they have a tough life, they really need to come out on this bus and have a look.
[03:23:25.949 --> 03:23:34.315]  You have Americans living in utter poverty, didn't before, because there's no insurance to cover any of the medical needs of these children.
[03:23:34.315 --> 03:23:34.796]  You've got parents
[03:23:36.457 --> 03:23:45.441]  That are either addicted to alcohol, addicted to drugs, in any way they can to numb the unbearable pain of the suffering of your child.
[03:23:45.441 --> 03:23:50.063]  Because no doctor will help the suffering of your nonverbal child.
[03:23:50.063 --> 03:24:00.207]  I have a friend with a nonverbal adult child who had to take her child to a veterinarian surgeon because no doctor would treat her child's clear abdominal pain.
[03:24:00.207 --> 03:24:04.369]  And she said, you are an expert in patients that cannot speak.
[03:24:04.949 --> 03:24:09.682]  So this is vaccine damage denialism, essentially.
[03:24:09.682 --> 03:24:12.850]  The entire medical establishment refuses to even acknowledge that this exists.
[03:24:13.302 --> 03:24:16.364]  Yeah, here's what's going to happen if you want to vaccinate.
[03:24:16.364 --> 03:24:18.165]  You are going to be told they're safe and effective.
[03:24:18.165 --> 03:24:19.566]  You are going to take that vaccine.
[03:24:19.566 --> 03:24:21.447]  You are going to have injury of some kind.
[03:24:21.447 --> 03:24:22.988]  This is what I've seen out on the road.
[03:24:22.988 --> 03:24:24.469]  You are then going to go back to your doctor.
[03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:28.031]  He's going to put a hand in your face and he's going to tell you it's not the vaccine.
[03:24:28.031 --> 03:24:33.414]  He's then going to do more tests on your child that do untold damage, which is going to make your child way worse.
[03:24:33.414 --> 03:24:37.496]  Then, when you complain again, you're going to be called crazy and CPS is going to be called on you.
[03:24:37.496 --> 03:24:38.617]  That is what's going to happen.
[03:24:38.697 --> 03:24:43.098]  Yeah, then they'll take your children away and forcefully vaccinate them and perhaps draw you up on charges.
[03:24:43.098 --> 03:24:47.279]  To prevent all of that, get out the insert, which is made by the manufacturers.
[03:24:47.279 --> 03:24:49.400]  There's no conspiracy theory.
[03:24:49.400 --> 03:24:50.520]  It is right there.
[03:24:50.520 --> 03:24:54.501]  The insert inside the vaccine thing, not the silly thing that they give you at the pharmacy.
[03:24:54.501 --> 03:24:55.061]  And read it.
[03:24:55.061 --> 03:24:57.322]  If you can't understand the long words, Google it.
[03:24:57.642 --> 03:25:05.428]  Yeah, well, get a microscope out if you have to, or a magnifying glass and read that fine print, because I've read it and they admit that they're dangerous.
[03:25:05.428 --> 03:25:07.390]  Let's go to this clip from your film.
[03:25:07.390 --> 03:25:11.393]  This clip is called Insanely Dangerous, which describes these vaccines.
[03:25:11.393 --> 03:25:12.274]  That's what they truly are.
[03:25:12.274 --> 03:25:16.677]  Let's check out this clip right now from Vaxxed 2, The People's Truth.
[03:25:16.677 --> 03:25:18.078]  It's coming out in theaters shortly.
[03:25:18.078 --> 03:25:18.799]  Let's take a look.
[03:25:19.932 --> 03:25:26.113]  I went in for a gynecologist appointment, got a pap smear, and they told me it came back abnormal.
[03:25:26.113 --> 03:25:30.094]  And I immediately started freaking out because I've never had one abnormal.
[03:25:30.094 --> 03:25:32.935]  Stage 3 neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix.
[03:25:32.935 --> 03:25:33.675]  Stage 3 cervical cancer.
[03:25:33.675 --> 03:25:33.775]  Yes.
[03:25:33.775 --> 03:25:34.455]  So that is when I said,
[03:25:42.293 --> 03:25:45.738]  Wait, I'm supposed to not get cervical cancer.
[03:25:45.738 --> 03:25:46.759]  I got this vaccine.
[03:25:46.759 --> 03:25:48.141]  I'm not supposed to get cervical cancer.
[03:25:48.141 --> 03:25:49.703]  I said, okay.
[03:25:49.703 --> 03:25:52.186]  I said, so what does that mean about the abnormal cells?
[03:25:52.186 --> 03:25:53.588]  And she said, well, they're pre-cancerous.
[03:25:54.921 --> 03:25:56.261]  And I said, cancer is for what?
[03:25:56.261 --> 03:25:57.942]  And she said, cervical cancer.
[03:25:57.942 --> 03:26:05.004]  And by the way, the pap and everything I'd had three months prior to getting Gardasil was clean.
[03:26:05.004 --> 03:26:06.424]  It was fine.
[03:26:06.424 --> 03:26:10.265]  You know, I was, and then nine months later, I had cervical cancer.
[03:26:10.265 --> 03:26:16.367]  I should have never got those shots because in my mind, I knew that they were what gave me HPV.
[03:26:16.367 --> 03:26:19.288]  So the problem with Gardasil, like most vaccines,
[03:26:20.568 --> 03:26:25.430]  It was never tested against a true placebo, an inert placebo.
[03:26:25.430 --> 03:26:32.033]  And CDC and HHS say if you don't test it against a true placebo, it's not science.
[03:26:32.033 --> 03:26:37.216]  A placebo is just an inert substance that doesn't cause any damage.
[03:26:38.056 --> 03:26:44.078]  That they give one group of individuals in a particular clinical study and then they give the drug.
[03:26:44.078 --> 03:26:45.778]  That's the experimental group.
[03:26:45.778 --> 03:26:48.979]  They give that to another set of individuals.
[03:26:48.979 --> 03:26:53.661]  The people that were supposed to be the control group, they got aluminum.
[03:26:53.661 --> 03:27:02.063]  And when they did that, out of every 100 patients, they had at least two severe autoimmune events.
[03:27:02.623 --> 03:27:14.547]  You have no way of gauging whether the injuries you're seeing from the product are being caused by that product or whether they're just bad, sad coincidences.
[03:27:14.547 --> 03:27:16.907]  The CDC knew about this.
[03:27:16.907 --> 03:27:20.589]  Merck, the manufacturer of the Gardasil vaccine, knew about this.
[03:27:20.589 --> 03:27:22.929]  It's as plain as the nose on your face.
[03:27:22.929 --> 03:27:25.410]  All you have to do is look at the clinical trial data.
[03:27:25.410 --> 03:27:31.192]  The entity that is actually performing the study and paying for the study is Merck.
[03:27:32.741 --> 03:27:41.851]  Merck got to decide which injuries were being caused by Gardasil and which were just bad coincidences.
[03:27:41.851 --> 03:27:47.177]  And because it had that power, it just wrote them all off as bad coincidences.
[03:27:47.177 --> 03:27:50.941]  You can do that when there's no placebo.
[03:27:50.941 --> 03:27:54.024]  Because the injuries they were seeing in the control group
[03:27:55.322 --> 03:28:03.666]  Where the girls were getting aluminum neurotoxins were identical to the injuries they were getting in the Gardasil group.
[03:28:03.666 --> 03:28:08.207]  So they said, well, we don't have to report any of these as vaccine injuries.
[03:28:08.207 --> 03:28:12.889]  They were able to license something that is insanely dangerous.
[03:28:12.889 --> 03:28:18.212]  So those are some of the clips from the new film Vax 2, which is coming out in theaters November 6th.
[03:28:19.392 --> 03:28:33.618]  But at secret locations, you can only find out by signing up at Vax2.com to get the email alert about where the theaters are, because the theaters are being threatened by these vaccine zealots, these vaccine pushers that are damaging your children.
[03:28:33.618 --> 03:28:38.880]  And I just want to mention too, you know, if you thought that the war on children
[03:28:39.440 --> 03:28:44.342]  Through, you know, pop culture and now the sexualization of children.
[03:28:44.342 --> 03:28:51.505]  The drag queen, you know, twerking, greasy old men in the libraries who are now, you know, talking to your children.
[03:28:51.505 --> 03:28:55.247]  If you thought that was bad, the vaccine industry is actually killing your children.
[03:28:55.247 --> 03:28:56.488]  It's not just indoctrination.
[03:28:56.488 --> 03:28:57.488]  It's not just brainwashing.
[03:28:57.488 --> 03:28:59.609]  It's actual killing your children.
[03:28:59.609 --> 03:29:00.630]  Much more straight ahead.
[03:29:00.630 --> 03:29:01.010]  Stay with us.
[03:29:01.790 --> 03:29:07.092]  One of the most frequently asked questions we get in customer service is, what is the Real Red Pill?
[03:29:07.092 --> 03:29:09.193]  And what is the Real Red Pill Plus?
[03:29:09.193 --> 03:29:15.095]  Well, Real Red Pill is a vitamin, mineral, multivitamin, high quality with preglanone.
[03:29:15.095 --> 03:29:21.437]  Real Red Pill Plus is the same thing with a little bit of clean added energy on top of it as well.
[03:29:21.437 --> 03:29:23.098]  That kicks in in 30 minutes.
[03:29:23.098 --> 03:29:26.299]  But the preglanone kicks in in about a week or so.
[03:29:27.279 --> 03:29:29.421]  Folks, look into preglanone for yourself.
[03:29:29.421 --> 03:29:39.810]  Look into high-end sources of it, like Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus, and then you'll definitely want to try it out and see the effects you get within about seven days to two weeks, generally.
[03:29:39.810 --> 03:29:41.752]  But believe me, it's a missing link.
[03:29:41.752 --> 03:29:42.793]  You need to find out about it.
[03:29:43.553 --> 03:29:45.656]  As we age, preglanone levels go down.
[03:29:45.656 --> 03:29:49.841]  All of our hormones in our body are manufactured by the body using preglanone.
[03:29:49.841 --> 03:29:56.329]  You need to learn about preglanone and then you need to get the Real Red Pill or the Real Red Pill Plus.
[03:29:56.329 --> 03:29:59.512]  Now 50% off at Infowarslife.com.
[03:29:59.512 --> 03:30:00.454]  The Real Red Pill Plus.
[03:30:02.742 --> 03:30:13.944]  Again, I'm not talking down to the InfoWars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride, and I'm talking about iodine.
[03:30:13.944 --> 03:30:24.066]  Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an old Blastron boat, and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[03:30:24.066 --> 03:30:26.387]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live.
[03:30:27.372 --> 03:30:28.954]  Okay, it's the same thing.
[03:30:28.954 --> 03:30:32.018]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride.
[03:30:32.018 --> 03:30:34.882]  That's why, in every western nation, they put it in the water.
[03:30:34.882 --> 03:30:37.005]  They're gonna teach us Christians to lay down and die.
[03:30:37.005 --> 03:30:38.847]  The Chai Kams don't put it in the water.
[03:30:38.847 --> 03:30:40.369]  They'd execute you if you did that.
[03:30:40.369 --> 03:30:42.312]  They put iodine in the water because
[03:30:42.312 --> 03:30:48.317]  Because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else.
[03:30:48.317 --> 03:30:52.261]  So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:52.261 --> 03:30:54.202]  We have all the documents and articles linked.
[03:30:54.202 --> 03:30:58.586]  And then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't.
[03:30:58.586 --> 03:31:04.271]  Again, get iodine at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:04.271 --> 03:31:06.013]  Here are the facts.
[03:31:07.290 --> 03:31:16.381]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies including the American Medical Journal.
[03:31:16.381 --> 03:31:22.808]  Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility.
[03:31:22.808 --> 03:31:23.609]  That's the fact.
[03:31:25.359 --> 03:31:25.859]  I think?
[03:31:42.248 --> 03:31:44.390]  The globalists are targeting us here.
[03:31:44.390 --> 03:31:46.331]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:46.331 --> 03:31:50.114]  Experience iodine and biotruth selenium that goes with it together.
[03:31:50.114 --> 03:31:52.836]  And then once you see the great results, warn others.
[03:31:52.836 --> 03:31:54.958]  This is the Achilles heel of the globalists.
[03:31:54.958 --> 03:31:56.199]  It's a win-win situation.
[03:31:56.199 --> 03:31:57.920]  The only way you lose is not taking action.
[03:31:57.920 --> 03:31:58.540]  Take action now.
[03:32:02.771 --> 03:32:07.237]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[03:32:07.237 --> 03:32:09.139]  I don't care what your views are.
[03:32:09.139 --> 03:32:12.162]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[03:32:12.162 --> 03:32:12.943]  That's important.
[03:32:12.943 --> 03:32:14.545]  But we have something in common.
[03:32:14.545 --> 03:32:18.150]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[03:32:18.630 --> 03:32:25.857]  Clinton deep state bag man Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to Congress and the world.
[03:32:25.857 --> 03:32:31.602]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted.
[03:32:31.602 --> 03:32:36.026]  Word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[03:32:36.026 --> 03:32:37.788]  From my new home in New Zealand I will...
[03:32:40.696 --> 03:32:44.279]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[03:32:44.279 --> 03:32:46.201]  Not so fast, criminal!
[03:32:46.201 --> 03:32:50.084]  We're going to bring you to justice, and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[03:32:50.084 --> 03:32:54.907]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[03:32:54.907 --> 03:33:05.796]  But the American people know how much you hate us, and we're fighting back at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Ban.Video!
[03:33:05.796 --> 03:33:08.438]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.307 --> 03:33:27.889]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:27.889 --> 03:33:31.170]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[03:33:33.527 --> 03:33:47.541]  We are here breaking exclusive interview news about this new bombshell film, Vax 2, The People's Truth, the true stories about how vaccines are devastating children across America.
[03:33:47.541 --> 03:33:54.168]  And now joining us, stepping in, is Jonathan Tommy, who, of course, is one of the producers of the film.
[03:33:54.748 --> 03:33:55.649]  Thank you, Mike.
[03:33:55.649 --> 03:33:57.090]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:33:57.090 --> 03:33:58.191]  Quick question for you.
[03:33:58.191 --> 03:33:59.192]  Yeah.
[03:33:59.192 --> 03:34:04.977]  This chemical violence that's being perpetrated against our children across America, which the media denies even exists.
[03:34:04.977 --> 03:34:05.538]  Sure.
[03:34:05.538 --> 03:34:12.624]  Can you talk about some of the chemical weapons or the chemicals, the ingredients that are toxic in vaccines?
[03:34:12.624 --> 03:34:12.824]  Sure.
[03:34:12.824 --> 03:34:13.605]  What are we talking about?
[03:34:13.965 --> 03:34:22.591]  I mean, if you look across the whole range, you've got 72 shots given to a child up until the age of 18 years of age.
[03:34:22.591 --> 03:34:26.995]  You've got multiple shots going in at their well baby clinic visit.
[03:34:26.995 --> 03:34:33.960]  So you've got multiple shots, none of which have had a safety study on this whole group going into the child at the same time.
[03:34:33.960 --> 03:34:36.642]  Not one single safety study.
[03:34:36.642 --> 03:34:38.003]  Then you look at all of the
[03:34:41.105 --> 03:34:49.449]  And the levels that the FDA have approved, 250 micrograms of aluminium throughout that whole period.
[03:34:49.449 --> 03:34:58.314]  They're getting over 4,250 micrograms directly into their blood system as a result of the shot.
[03:34:58.314 --> 03:35:02.977]  When you look at the children who have regressed,
[03:35:03.957 --> 03:35:22.728]  As a result of vaccines, you only have to look at aluminium as one component and there's hundreds of these different ingredients from fetal DNA to polysorbate 80 to all of these unknown fragments of protein from animals such as rabbit, cow, pig, chicken.
[03:35:22.728 --> 03:35:23.248]  Oh yeah.
[03:35:23.248 --> 03:35:24.969]  So you've got monkeys.
[03:35:24.969 --> 03:35:25.749]  Absolutely.
[03:35:25.749 --> 03:35:26.450]  So you've got
[03:35:27.290 --> 03:35:30.074]  And thimerosal obviously is still in a few.
[03:35:30.074 --> 03:35:40.266]  So you've got all of these untested chemicals going into these shots, given to these susceptible babies who have no detoxification maturity at that age.
[03:35:40.266 --> 03:35:45.192]  But isn't it, on top of that, the vaccine companies have absolute legal immunity.
[03:35:45.612 --> 03:35:45.952]  Sure.
[03:35:45.952 --> 03:35:54.436]  So, you know, if a car company made unsafe cars, you could sue that car manufacturer for killing your child in a car accident caused by that unsafe practice.
[03:35:54.436 --> 03:35:57.198]  But a vaccine company, they don't have to have any quality control.
[03:35:57.198 --> 03:36:02.420]  They can put literally anything into a vaccine and call it a vaccine, and there's no recourse.
[03:36:02.540 --> 03:36:12.187]  Yeah, and the safety testing, because they classify vaccine as a biologics, doesn't go through the same double-blind placebo trials as a pharmaceutical drug.
[03:36:12.187 --> 03:36:20.933]  So this 1986 act that was passed by Reagan in government, giving no liability to the manufacturer of vaccines, is a criminal.
[03:36:21.793 --> 03:36:24.214]  Offense to the American public.
[03:36:24.214 --> 03:36:48.282]  Absolutely and it also didn't it didn't it motivate vaccine manufacturers to put more vaccines on the childhood immunization schedule so they could enjoy that legal protection so that they're now using our American children as just I don't know carpet bombing grounds for for for chemicals and and DNA fragments and RNA fragments so they can make more money while our children suffer and die.
[03:36:48.282 --> 03:36:48.902]  Sure I mean
[03:36:49.884 --> 03:36:53.026]  Injecting human DNA, full genome.
[03:36:53.026 --> 03:36:53.546]  Yes.
[03:36:53.546 --> 03:36:59.009]  Found in the MMR5 vaccine by a company, a laboratory in Italy.
[03:36:59.009 --> 03:37:04.471]  What is that going to do to the DNA sequencing in a human being?
[03:37:04.471 --> 03:37:10.694]  Having another human protein, full genome, injected into them.
[03:37:10.694 --> 03:37:12.575]  Autoimmunity guaranteed.
[03:37:12.575 --> 03:37:16.457]  So you're basically setting up the child's immune system to attack itself.
[03:37:16.457 --> 03:37:17.278]  Pain and allergies.
[03:37:17.938 --> 03:37:20.842]  Let me direct a question to Polly here.
[03:37:20.842 --> 03:37:22.804]  Now, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[03:37:22.804 --> 03:37:26.048]  is one of the executive directors on this film.
[03:37:26.048 --> 03:37:28.190]  And I know you trust his voice.
[03:37:28.190 --> 03:37:28.631]  I do too.
[03:37:28.631 --> 03:37:31.534]  I think he's an American hero, by the way.
[03:37:31.534 --> 03:37:34.598]  Children's Health Defense is the name of his non-profit group.
[03:37:34.598 --> 03:37:35.218]  Everybody follow it.
[03:37:35.859 --> 03:37:36.819]  Very important.
[03:37:36.819 --> 03:37:38.580]  ChildrensHealthDefense.org, is that what it is?
[03:37:38.580 --> 03:37:38.940]  Yeah.
[03:37:38.940 --> 03:37:39.281]  Yeah.
[03:37:39.281 --> 03:37:40.581]  Yeah, is that right?
[03:37:40.581 --> 03:37:43.442]  Okay, so who else is involved in this film?
[03:37:43.442 --> 03:37:53.327]  Well, so Robert Kendi is the executive producer and it's really important to us that he is as well because he is, if you like, our leader going forward.
[03:37:53.327 --> 03:37:57.689]  So Children's Health Defence, protecting, protecting, protecting the rights of our children.
[03:37:57.689 --> 03:38:02.731]  So we're really honoured to have him and he's such a good, good man, takes time to listen to the parents the whole time.
[03:38:03.211 --> 03:38:04.772]  Other people involved in the film?
[03:38:04.772 --> 03:38:06.432]  Well, of course we did an interview with Del Bigtree.
[03:38:06.432 --> 03:38:07.833]  He does a brilliant, he's very experienced.
[03:38:07.833 --> 03:38:11.554]  Andy Wakefield, of course, does a brilliant job on measles.
[03:38:11.554 --> 03:38:12.615]  But can I just say one thing?
[03:38:12.615 --> 03:38:13.835]  Really, really important here.
[03:38:13.835 --> 03:38:14.796]  Let's just listen to you two there.
[03:38:15.706 --> 03:38:24.356]  One of the other biggest lies involved in this, and I'm really talking to those new parents if you're listening right now and sitting on the fence a bit about these vaccines.
[03:38:24.356 --> 03:38:32.525]  You, we've got to stop, this is where John and I went wrong, we've got to stop bowing down to the white coats, the doctors, as if they are gods.
[03:38:33.346 --> 03:38:40.574]  We're told, and it's not our fault because, in a way, because we go through school and we're told, you know, if you're really clever, one day you'll grow up and be a doctor.
[03:38:40.574 --> 03:38:43.358]  And so we're told from a young age that doctors are the best.
[03:38:43.358 --> 03:38:48.063]  Now we interviewed hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of doctors and medical professionals and
[03:38:48.303 --> 03:38:56.509]  Every single one of them told us, get this, breaking news, they have absolutely no training on vaccines whatsoever.
[03:38:56.509 --> 03:38:57.050]  Wow.
[03:38:57.050 --> 03:38:59.611]  Other than they're safe and effective and they're the saviors of mankind.
[03:38:59.611 --> 03:39:11.080]  I've even seen cases where someone, for example, an elderly patient goes into a hospital with some condition and the first thing they say is, have you been vaccinated with this year's flu vaccine?
[03:39:11.080 --> 03:39:15.964]  And even when that person is compromised and immunosuppressed, they'll be given vaccine shots in the hospital.
[03:39:16.644 --> 03:39:22.326]  With a message like, if you don't agree to these vaccine shots, we can't even treat you for this other thing, pneumonia or whatever you're dealing with.
[03:39:22.326 --> 03:39:23.006]  That's insane!
[03:39:23.006 --> 03:39:26.647]  You don't vaccinate people when they're already immunosuppressed.
[03:39:26.647 --> 03:39:39.170]  We've had doctors, we've had nurses, the front line of these hospitals telling us that when patients are in comas, they're instructed to go and give them the flu shot because they have to fill the paperwork out for insurance.
[03:39:39.170 --> 03:39:42.971]  Oh boy, that's the best time for the vaccine industry to get them when you're unconscious.
[03:39:45.231 --> 03:39:47.912]  Medical molestation of coma patients.
[03:39:47.912 --> 03:39:48.672]  That's sick.
[03:39:48.672 --> 03:39:58.674]  We have hundreds and hundreds of interviews of medical professionals coming forward as the real whistleblowers talking about the absolutely disgusting things that are going on behind the scenes of these vaccines.
[03:39:58.674 --> 03:40:02.295]  I mean, what they also said is that they had no education.
[03:40:02.295 --> 03:40:06.496]  So seven hours of education on vaccines, as Polly said, safe and effective.
[03:40:06.496 --> 03:40:07.896]  Here is the schedule.
[03:40:07.896 --> 03:40:08.316]  Off you go.
[03:40:08.996 --> 03:40:09.997]  Doctors.
[03:40:09.997 --> 03:40:11.998]  Doctors, pediatricians, nurses.
[03:40:11.998 --> 03:40:12.579]  No clue.
[03:40:12.579 --> 03:40:22.747]  So, as Polly said, we're trusting people who are there to supposedly have the knowledge, but it's like having an electrician into your house who doesn't even know how to change a plug.
[03:40:22.747 --> 03:40:27.271]  I've never met a doctor who had any idea about the ingredients that were actually in vaccines.
[03:40:27.611 --> 03:40:31.192]  They're clueless, and I ask them, like, did you know about squalene?
[03:40:31.192 --> 03:40:32.233]  Do you know about aluminum?
[03:40:32.233 --> 03:40:36.114]  Do you know about aborted human fetal tissue cells in vaccines?
[03:40:36.114 --> 03:40:37.935]  And they say, no, that can't be.
[03:40:37.935 --> 03:40:40.836]  There can't be aborted human babies in vaccines.
[03:40:40.836 --> 03:40:41.857]  Oh, yes, there are.
[03:40:41.857 --> 03:40:47.899]  In fact, the gene sequence has been done, and those babies have hundreds of cancer genes, and that's all on purpose.
[03:40:48.379 --> 03:40:50.120]  And dog kidneys, so vegans.
[03:40:50.120 --> 03:40:52.860]  I meet so many vegans that vaccinate.
[03:40:52.860 --> 03:40:53.861]  Well, think about it.
[03:40:53.861 --> 03:40:56.281]  You're vaccinating animal parts into you.
[03:40:56.281 --> 03:40:56.722]  Right, right.
[03:40:56.722 --> 03:40:57.622]  Think about that, if nothing else.
[03:40:57.622 --> 03:41:02.323]  Well, what about those who are interested in kosher lifestyles or halal, even?
[03:41:02.323 --> 03:41:15.207]  You know, how can a follower of Islam inject themselves, their children, with vaccines made from the aborted human fetal parts of other... I mean, it gets so insane.
[03:41:15.207 --> 03:41:18.128]  It violates every religion in the world, it seems.
[03:41:18.208 --> 03:41:20.110]  But it's all based on fear.
[03:41:20.110 --> 03:41:26.418]  It's based on fear that you will die of measles, and now apparently chickenpox, and you'll die of diphtheria, and you'll die of polio.
[03:41:26.418 --> 03:41:32.725]  And I interviewed, the only two people I interviewed with polio on the roads of America, both got polio from the vaccine.
[03:41:32.725 --> 03:41:33.345]  From the vaccine itself.
[03:41:35.047 --> 03:41:36.028]  It's a matter of thinking.
[03:41:36.028 --> 03:41:39.730]  For some reason, our brains are not thinking when it comes to vaccines.
[03:41:39.730 --> 03:41:41.391]  All right, let me just mention this.
[03:41:41.391 --> 03:41:48.375]  The reason that this message is here today is because of your support of InfoWars and InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:41:53.198 --> 03:41:55.639]  40 to 70% off, it's the everything must go sale.
[03:41:55.639 --> 03:42:01.302]  The reason I mention this is I couldn't be here, they couldn't be here, we couldn't be bringing you this message without your support.

[03:42:17.008 --> 03:42:20.809]  That's why this message is coming to you here at InfoWars, because of your support.
[03:42:20.809 --> 03:42:21.990]  Thank you for that support.
[03:42:21.990 --> 03:42:31.533]  We're going to break here in just a few seconds, but Jonathan, I want to ask you about what parents can do, you know, besides seeing this film.
[03:42:32.113 --> 03:42:40.678]  Think about what can we do to push back against this system that is literally murdering or sacrificing or maiming our children for the profits of the vaccine industry.
[03:42:40.678 --> 03:42:41.839]  How do we push back?
[03:42:41.839 --> 03:42:49.403]  I know what you're doing with the Vax 2 film, but for those watching and listening out there, what can they do in addition to seeing the film?
[03:42:49.403 --> 03:42:51.305]  What can they do to push back against the system?
[03:42:51.305 --> 03:42:55.087]  It is a system of chemical violence against children.
[03:42:55.087 --> 03:42:57.688]  It's not just brainwashing, it's chemical violence.
[03:42:57.688 --> 03:42:59.810]  They're coming for your children and vaccines are the vector.
[03:43:02.895 --> 03:43:06.919]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[03:43:06.919 --> 03:43:14.906]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[03:43:14.906 --> 03:43:17.508]  It's just that simple.
[03:43:17.508 --> 03:43:23.894]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[03:43:23.894 --> 03:43:24.435]  Others like
[03:43:24.995 --> 03:43:27.097]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[03:43:27.097 --> 03:43:27.817]  Get both.
[03:43:27.817 --> 03:43:29.278]  They're both great for you.
[03:43:29.278 --> 03:43:33.701]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[03:43:33.701 --> 03:43:35.903]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[03:43:35.903 --> 03:43:37.263]  That's why I harp on it.
[03:43:37.263 --> 03:43:41.426]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[03:43:41.426 --> 03:43:43.588]  Lower IQ makes you sluggish.
[03:43:43.588 --> 03:43:44.688]  You don't live as long.
[03:43:44.688 --> 03:43:45.429]  It's simple.
[03:43:45.429 --> 03:43:49.712]  Get your high-quality iodine at InfoWareStore.com and help fund the InfoWare.
[03:43:50.012 --> 03:43:52.114]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:52.114 --> 03:43:54.816]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[03:43:54.816 --> 03:43:56.638]  It's the Iodine Challenge.
[03:43:56.638 --> 03:44:01.562]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[03:44:01.562 --> 03:44:07.107]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[03:44:07.107 --> 03:44:10.129]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body.
[03:44:10.129 --> 03:44:14.553]  God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body.
[03:44:14.553 --> 03:44:16.635]  If people didn't know that
[03:44:16.735 --> 03:44:27.618]  If you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine, they might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[03:44:27.618 --> 03:44:32.980]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[03:44:32.980 --> 03:44:40.582]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good, high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it.
[03:44:40.762 --> 03:44:41.662]  It's that simple.
[03:44:41.662 --> 03:44:47.866]  Find out about the Iodine Conspiracy at InfoWarsTore.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[03:44:47.866 --> 03:44:51.648]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research Iodine Deficiency.
[03:44:51.648 --> 03:44:53.589]  It's the key to everything.
[03:44:53.589 --> 03:45:01.193]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high quality Iodine and BioTruth Selenium at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[03:45:02.757 --> 03:45:06.339]  InfoWars presents Alex Jones.
[03:45:06.339 --> 03:45:21.608]  In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious, came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies die in the womb, and it causes cancer.
[03:45:21.608 --> 03:45:24.710]  That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:27.812]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water.
[03:45:28.052 --> 03:45:28.252]  Yeah.
[03:45:47.108 --> 03:45:49.209]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:46:02.839 --> 03:46:03.880]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[03:46:03.880 --> 03:46:04.982]  Hey Alex!
[03:46:04.982 --> 03:46:06.324]  Oh my God!
[03:46:06.324 --> 03:46:09.127]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[03:46:09.127 --> 03:46:11.791]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[03:46:11.791 --> 03:46:15.576]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June.
[03:46:15.576 --> 03:46:19.281]  And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[03:46:19.281 --> 03:46:20.042]  Let me tell you something, man.
[03:46:20.602 --> 03:46:28.006]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[03:46:28.006 --> 03:46:29.787]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[03:46:29.787 --> 03:46:36.130]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what, I'm gonna get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[03:46:36.130 --> 03:46:39.092]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff.
[03:46:39.312 --> 03:46:47.577]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses, I started taking it, man, that stuff changed my life, it saved my life.
[03:46:47.577 --> 03:46:57.042]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't care if you've traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that Living Defense.
[03:46:57.042 --> 03:47:05.687]  It's true folks, we don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and Living Defense is over the top good.
[03:47:05.687 --> 03:47:08.349]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:30.925 --> 03:47:32.165]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[03:47:32.165 --> 03:47:33.266]  Hey Alex!
[03:47:33.266 --> 03:47:34.586]  Oh my God!
[03:47:34.586 --> 03:47:37.587]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[03:47:37.587 --> 03:47:42.488]  Alex, I gotta tell you man, I don't care what anybody has ever said about you.
[03:47:42.488 --> 03:47:48.770]  You have re-appealed more human beings than anybody on planet Earth and God bless you.
[03:47:48.770 --> 03:47:51.051]  Everything you stand for, everything you've done.
[03:47:52.137 --> 03:47:53.517]  You are the best, man.
[03:47:53.517 --> 03:47:55.258]  I mean, it's the absolute truth.
[03:47:55.258 --> 03:48:00.759]  And when I heard you today with this live call, and you encouraged people to call in, I said, that's it, man.
[03:48:00.759 --> 03:48:01.660]  I'm just going to break down.
[03:48:01.660 --> 03:48:05.021]  I got to tell you, look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[03:48:05.021 --> 03:48:09.202]  I went in the VA hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[03:48:09.202 --> 03:48:13.603]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to InfoWars
[03:48:14.461 --> 03:48:20.823]  Every day for three hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[03:48:20.823 --> 03:48:22.324]  Let me tell you something, man.
[03:48:22.324 --> 03:48:29.787]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[03:48:29.787 --> 03:48:31.547]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[03:48:31.547 --> 03:48:35.549]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[03:48:35.549 --> 03:48:38.150]  I'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense.
[03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:41.171]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff.
[03:48:41.591 --> 03:48:43.472]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[03:48:43.472 --> 03:48:44.013]  I got it.
[03:48:44.013 --> 03:48:45.574]  I hid it from the nurses.
[03:48:45.574 --> 03:48:46.634]  I started taking it.
[03:48:46.634 --> 03:48:49.036]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[03:48:49.036 --> 03:48:50.276]  It saved my life.
[03:48:50.276 --> 03:48:53.198]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[03:48:53.198 --> 03:49:03.825]  Listen, man, if there's any veteran out there, I don't care if you've traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that Living Defense.
[03:49:03.825 --> 03:49:04.525]  It's true, folks.
[03:49:04.525 --> 03:49:07.567]  We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality.
[03:49:07.567 --> 03:49:09.168]  And Living Defense is over-the-top good.
[03:49:09.548 --> 03:49:10.812]  We're not making this up.
[03:49:10.812 --> 03:49:14.643]  Just like our information is game-changing, the products are game-changing.
[03:49:27.679 --> 03:49:33.886]  Alright, we're being joined now by Anu, who's the associate producer of this new film, Vax 2, The People's Truth.
[03:49:33.886 --> 03:49:36.829]  We've got, like, a lot of the crew from the film here all together.
[03:49:36.829 --> 03:49:37.870]  It's pretty cool.
[03:49:37.870 --> 03:49:44.298]  Anu, I heard that before you got involved with this film, you were actually pro-vaccine.
[03:49:44.298 --> 03:49:46.480]  What changed, or how did it happen?
[03:49:46.480 --> 03:49:47.922]  I mean, it was more of a...
[03:49:48.342 --> 03:49:50.023]  You know, you just do what the doctors say.
[03:49:50.023 --> 03:49:50.824]  You know what I mean?
[03:49:50.824 --> 03:49:56.687]  You just do it, they go in, they give you the injections, that's how you get into school, that's how you get to do anything.
[03:49:56.687 --> 03:49:58.369]  And you trust whatever the doctors say.
[03:49:58.369 --> 03:49:59.609]  So I was like, whatever.
[03:49:59.609 --> 03:50:03.772]  If the doctors are doing it, it must be true, everybody's getting it, I must be fine.
[03:50:03.772 --> 03:50:05.173]  And that's what I did.
[03:50:05.173 --> 03:50:09.456]  And the only thing that we stopped doing was the flu vaccine because we just kept getting sick from it.
[03:50:09.456 --> 03:50:10.857]  Which should have been a sign, right?
[03:50:11.517 --> 03:50:12.377]  It should have been a sign.
[03:50:12.377 --> 03:50:21.140]  But when I first joined the team, you know, I actually, the first day I showed up, right, I had watched, you know, Vax at that point, and I said to him, listen, I get with you.
[03:50:21.140 --> 03:50:25.321]  I'm with you on this whole MMR vaccine causing regressive autism.
[03:50:25.321 --> 03:50:26.081]  I'll get you there.
[03:50:26.081 --> 03:50:30.262]  But I don't know if I'm with you on this whole vaccines cause other injuries.
[03:50:30.262 --> 03:50:34.063]  I was just like, no, I don't think that that's really happening.
[03:50:34.063 --> 03:50:35.324]  And they were like, yeah, you'll see.
[03:50:36.605 --> 03:50:48.861]  So we go out on tour and we start doing all these interviews and we're sitting there and slowly but surely I'm like hmm something's kind of weird here and then it wasn't like what a week in we did this Garcelle story and I was like
[03:50:49.884 --> 03:50:53.186]  Holy cow, I don't know what I'm talking about.
[03:50:53.186 --> 03:50:55.508]  I have no idea what I'm talking about.
[03:50:55.508 --> 03:50:57.849]  I'm completely wrong in my assumptions.
[03:50:57.849 --> 03:50:59.890]  I need to listen to these stories more.
[03:50:59.890 --> 03:51:02.152]  And then, you know, the rest of the tour happened.
[03:51:02.152 --> 03:51:05.874]  Now we're here with Vax 2, which is like a combination of that tour.
[03:51:05.874 --> 03:51:10.157]  And we're going to start seeing, and people are going to have the same realizations that I did.
[03:51:10.157 --> 03:51:13.819]  How many people do you think that you talked to over all these months of touring?
[03:51:13.819 --> 03:51:15.720]  I mean, thousands.
[03:51:15.720 --> 03:51:16.141]  Thousands.
[03:51:16.921 --> 03:51:25.648]  Yeah, Anu and I traveled not just America, we did England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Canada, Australia, which I got thrown out of, and then New Zealand.
[03:51:25.648 --> 03:51:27.930]  So we've heard, this is the same story.
[03:51:27.930 --> 03:51:28.330]  Right.
[03:51:28.330 --> 03:51:30.411]  As it is in America worldwide.
[03:51:30.411 --> 03:51:42.681]  Now what about this, you know, they say, well we've tested vaccines and they're safe, of course they're making that up, but they've never really done a vaccinated versus unvaccinated study that's been rigorous and double blind controlled, you know, placebo controlled study.
[03:51:43.041 --> 03:51:44.081]  What about that issue?
[03:51:44.081 --> 03:51:47.562]  Well, we know why they don't want to do that study.
[03:51:47.562 --> 03:51:53.744]  Because we went out on the road and we spoke to the parents, the families, that have their own study inside the house.
[03:51:53.744 --> 03:51:57.165]  Same parents, they have their first child, they vaccinate it.
[03:51:57.165 --> 03:52:00.665]  The child has either got autism or is severely injured.
[03:52:00.665 --> 03:52:08.928]  They've had another child, they haven't quite worked it out, so the next child is partially, so has eczema, allergies, and all those other things that we saw associated with vaccines.
[03:52:08.928 --> 03:52:10.008]  Then they say, okay, we're done.
[03:52:10.788 --> 03:52:19.554]  They go on and have more children and they talk to us about the supersonic health, the very, very strong health and intelligence.
[03:52:19.554 --> 03:52:20.815]  That's very important as well.
[03:52:20.815 --> 03:52:26.038]  Every family talked about the intelligence of the unvaccinated compared to the vaccinated.
[03:52:26.038 --> 03:52:27.599]  It was night and day.
[03:52:27.599 --> 03:52:28.660]  We have that study.
[03:52:29.480 --> 03:52:30.241]  We've done it.
[03:52:30.241 --> 03:52:31.222]  The people study.
[03:52:31.222 --> 03:52:44.492]  So you have, I would say, it's anecdotal evidence, but it's a tremendous amount of it, of people talking to you about having multiple children and the child who's unvaccinated is the healthiest and the most intelligent, as you just said.
[03:52:44.492 --> 03:52:45.093]  Is that correct?
[03:52:45.093 --> 03:52:45.153]  Yes.
[03:52:46.618 --> 03:52:53.580]  We spoke to Brian Hooker, because he knows how they do these scientific studies that we're all supposed to bow down to.
[03:52:53.580 --> 03:52:54.840]  It's the same thing.
[03:52:54.840 --> 03:53:00.801]  They look at the medical records of the people of America, and these people just pull up randomly, whatever it may be.
[03:53:00.801 --> 03:53:05.642]  So what we've done is actually more thorough than a proper scientific study.
[03:53:05.642 --> 03:53:07.863]  And we didn't pick these people up, remember.
[03:53:07.863 --> 03:53:09.143]  They came to us.
[03:53:09.143 --> 03:53:09.983]  Right, exactly.
[03:53:09.983 --> 03:53:16.085]  So they knew that they were being lied to this entire time, and now they're seeing the harm that can be caused
[03:53:16.525 --> 03:53:20.248]  And that's further proof that we, the parents with our injured children, are correct.
[03:53:20.248 --> 03:53:28.575]  We're so pleased for the unvaccinated and the super healthy, but it's also a massive stab for us because that is, we should never have vaccinated our children.
[03:53:28.575 --> 03:53:28.876]  Right.
[03:53:28.876 --> 03:53:31.358]  Because they're all, everyone is vaccinated.
[03:53:31.958 --> 03:53:37.100]  Well, from then on, I'm telling you, you will not lead the life you were supposed to have led.
[03:53:37.100 --> 03:53:43.822]  Jonathan, as a parent of a vaccine-injured child, what would be your message to other parents?
[03:53:43.822 --> 03:53:53.985]  Okay, well, my biggest mistake that I regret, I will regret it till the day I die, is having Billy vaccinated and being a naive and ignorant parent.
[03:53:53.985 --> 03:53:55.266]  I didn't do my research.
[03:53:55.646 --> 03:53:59.390]  You rely on doctors to give you fully informed consent.
[03:53:59.390 --> 03:54:01.412]  They do nothing of the sort.
[03:54:01.412 --> 03:54:04.496]  I want to see the insert to the vaccine.
[03:54:04.496 --> 03:54:07.099]  I want to ask questions about the vaccine.
[03:54:07.099 --> 03:54:08.380]  Where was it?
[03:54:08.380 --> 03:54:09.701]  How long have you had it on the shelf?
[03:54:09.701 --> 03:54:10.783]  Where has it been stored?
[03:54:11.283 --> 03:54:15.465]  I then want to discuss every single risk and every single ingredient.
[03:54:15.465 --> 03:54:20.027]  If the doctor or pediatrician cannot answer that question, I'm out of that clinic.
[03:54:20.027 --> 03:54:29.130]  So, do your homework, listen to the parents, and this film is so important because we're not telling them to make up these stories.
[03:54:29.130 --> 03:54:31.991]  These are true life stories.
[03:54:31.991 --> 03:54:39.154]  Incidents that's happened to their children, whether they've died or whether they've been severely injured, listen to the parents, not the doctors.
[03:54:39.154 --> 03:54:41.135]  So there are no paid actors in the film?
[03:54:41.795 --> 03:54:42.656]  Absolutely none.
[03:54:42.656 --> 03:54:46.217]  These are real parents with real stories of real injuries of their children.
[03:54:46.217 --> 03:54:47.938]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:54:47.938 --> 03:54:52.180]  And it takes a lot of courage on their part, I would think, to get on camera and tell the story, right?
[03:54:52.180 --> 03:55:01.805]  Well, I mean, I think the film Vaxxed gave people, and then when Polly started recording the stories, it gave them the confidence.
[03:55:01.805 --> 03:55:08.288]  Remember, these parents have had doctors shun their faces and push them under the rugs, saying absolutely no correlation between the two.
[03:55:08.968 --> 03:55:19.694]  These parents are telling the truth and Polly and the team and Vax have given them that opportunity to get courageous and say exactly what happened to them.
[03:55:19.694 --> 03:55:21.615]  And one more question to you.
[03:55:21.615 --> 03:55:32.320]  When doctors question the vaccine dogma, don't they find, I'm sure you've spoken to some, don't they find they lose their license, they lose their jobs, they lose their reputation, they get smeared?
[03:55:32.320 --> 03:55:33.301]  Are you seeing that out there?
[03:55:33.301 --> 03:55:33.961]  I mean the thing is,
[03:55:34.301 --> 03:55:36.303]  They're pharmaceutical pawns.
[03:55:36.303 --> 03:55:44.854]  Bottom line is that they look at the drug, they look at the symptom, they look at the drug to use and they go with it and they get paid to do that.
[03:55:44.854 --> 03:55:51.802]  What is happening here is doctors are not educated correctly on the dangers of this pharmaceutical product.
[03:55:52.202 --> 03:55:53.563]  They need to do their job.
[03:55:53.563 --> 03:55:55.003]  First, do no harm.
[03:55:55.003 --> 03:55:56.544]  Do your research, doctor.
[03:55:56.544 --> 03:55:57.264]  Go back.
[03:55:57.264 --> 03:55:58.744]  You read the damn insert.
[03:55:58.744 --> 03:56:00.085]  You look at the ingredients.
[03:56:00.085 --> 03:56:01.605]  You listen to the parents.
[03:56:01.605 --> 03:56:03.906]  And then you wise up and make the decision.
[03:56:03.906 --> 03:56:04.747]  Hang on a minute.
[03:56:04.747 --> 03:56:08.848]  I'm not sure if I'm practicing what the oath tells me to practice.
[03:56:09.268 --> 03:56:18.231]  Isn't it fascinating that you have many people in America who are very sensitive to food labels, and they look at every ingredient on a food or a supplement, which is appropriate.
[03:56:18.231 --> 03:56:20.972]  But then when it comes to vaccines, they say, ah, anything goes.
[03:56:20.972 --> 03:56:23.493]  They don't even read the label of what's in it.
[03:56:23.493 --> 03:56:23.953]  Yeah.
[03:56:23.953 --> 03:56:26.474]  They've got to be given the label, Mike, in order to read it.
[03:56:26.474 --> 03:56:33.896]  But the thing is, you can be clever parents, go straight to the manufacturer's websites, and look at the insert for yourself.
[03:56:34.076 --> 03:56:34.977]  Do your own homework.
[03:56:34.977 --> 03:56:35.637]  That's true.
[03:56:35.637 --> 03:56:48.028]  Yeah, if you go to GlaxoSmithKline's website, which I think is just gsk.com, and you search for ingredients like MRC5 or WI38, those are aborted human fetal cells, you will stir up some interesting stuff.
[03:56:48.028 --> 03:56:56.456]  Last word, anew, why are you willing to subject yourself to all of this censorship and public abuse for telling the truth about vaccines with this film?
[03:56:56.656 --> 03:57:01.819]  It really comes down to the number one issue that we have in this country, which is freedom of speech.
[03:57:01.819 --> 03:57:04.760]  Like, that's the number one issue that we are all fighting.
[03:57:04.760 --> 03:57:06.021]  Infowars has had to deal with it.
[03:57:06.684 --> 03:57:11.887]  You know, every single independent news source now has to deal with that thing.
[03:57:11.887 --> 03:57:20.013]  And I gotta tell you, like, being out on tour, I realized the censorship of just people's stories, that's ridiculous.
[03:57:20.013 --> 03:57:25.136]  I mean, it's just, if someone wants to just tell people their stories, what's the harm in listening to them?
[03:57:25.136 --> 03:57:26.597]  Well, exactly.
[03:57:26.597 --> 03:57:28.138]  And that's what the film is all about.
[03:57:28.138 --> 03:57:29.519]  The film is Vax 2.
[03:57:29.519 --> 03:57:32.401]  The website is vax2.com.
[03:57:32.401 --> 03:57:36.484]  And it's very clear we're going to have to have the Deep State triple vaccinate you.
[03:57:36.804 --> 03:57:39.167]  We stopped you from speaking out from now on.
[03:57:39.167 --> 03:57:41.009]  All of you, off with your heads.
[03:57:41.009 --> 03:57:42.691]  Vaccines for everyone.
[03:57:42.691 --> 03:57:44.833]  You can no longer be allowed to think for yourself.
[03:57:44.833 --> 03:57:45.634]  You can't wake up.
[03:57:45.634 --> 03:57:46.936]  You can't speak out.
[03:57:46.936 --> 03:57:49.939]  And don't go see Vax 2, The People's Truth.
[03:57:49.939 --> 03:57:50.880]  It's coming out soon.
[03:57:50.880 --> 03:57:51.561]  Don't go see it.
