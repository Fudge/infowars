[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:05.410]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:16.953]  Well, if you're under 40, you might be surprised to learn that people didn't used to express concern about the environment by littering.
[00:00:17.993 --> 00:00:19.314]  That used to seem weird.
[00:00:19.694 --> 00:00:24.435]  But then the point of environmentalism used to be about nature and preserving it and protecting it.
[00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:27.005]  The point now is very different.
[00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:29.166]  The point now is political power.
[00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:34.347]  You gin up a crisis and you demand the population submits to your will or else.
[00:00:35.488 --> 00:00:41.469]  And as you do that, of course, you don't need to fight fair, or acknowledge democracy, or even make a rational case for your position.
[00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:42.730]  You do whatever it takes.
[00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.491]  You'll even use children, if it helps.
[00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:51.912]  Just today, for example, a 16-year-old Swedish girl addressed the United Nations at the behest of climate activists.
[00:00:52.513 --> 00:00:53.453]  Here's part of what she said.
[00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:55.807]  This is all wrong.
[00:00:55.827 --> 00:00:58.671]  I shouldn't be up here.
[00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.037]  I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean.
[00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.984]  Yet, you all come to us young people for hope.
[00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:09.866]  How dare you?
[00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:16.166]  You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.
[00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:26.150]  We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.
[00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:27.630]  How dare you!
[00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:37.094]  If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil and that I refuse to believe.
[00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:40.875]  You stole my childhood.
[00:01:41.516 --> 00:01:43.776]  Do what I want you to do or else you're evil!
[00:01:45.357 --> 00:01:46.877]  How do you respond to statements like that?
[00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:49.418]  The truth is, you can't respond.
[00:01:49.738 --> 00:01:51.418]  And of course, that's the point.
[00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.340]  When you use children to demand power, they become a kind of human shield.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.320]  You can hide safely behind them.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.821]  No one can criticize you.
[00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.081]  But who would do something that unscrupulous?
[00:02:03.702 --> 00:02:08.403]  Anyone who would do that is someone who would literally do anything to seize control.
[00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:11.929]  Well, that's very well said, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.533]  Thank you for joining us on this September 24th, 2019 Global Broadcast.
[00:02:17.674 --> 00:02:22.997]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:26.160]  Now, Greta Thunberg is super annoying.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.441]  She's autistic.
[00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:31.390]  On record, her parents are Antifa, globalist.
[00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.271]  She's openly funded by George Soros.
[00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:35.031]  We're going to document all that after the break.
[00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:53.921]  But you really cannot get away from the historical parallels of a German youth lecturing the world on how they better behave at the behest of powerful organizations and institutions that seek to take full control of the infrastructure of the planet and have AI computers watch every activity.
[00:02:55.083 --> 00:02:58.204]  That we engage in on this earth.
[00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:07.366]  This whole carbon tax program is about a societal takeover of the civilization.
[00:03:08.347 --> 00:03:11.408]  That's really what it comes down to at the end of the day.
[00:03:11.428 --> 00:03:19.090]  And it's extremely dangerous and they know that they can't brainwash and convince adults to submit to all of this.
[00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.411]  And so now they're simply moving forward taking action
[00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:33.224]  against the children, a classical authoritarian move that is done over and over and over again throughout history.
[00:03:33.825 --> 00:03:44.849]  So I put together last night a powerful report, I think, where I look at this from the perspective of somebody like Bill Gates.
[00:03:46.053 --> 00:03:48.836]  And where you can also look at it from the perspective of the globals, what they're trying to do.
[00:03:48.856 --> 00:03:49.797]  We're going to be airing that later.
[00:03:50.118 --> 00:04:00.590]  But first, my breakdown of Greta Thunberg on the other side of this break that we're going to be going over here today.
[00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:03.633]  The news sites are InfoWars.com.
[00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:10.282]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:10.322 --> 00:04:12.083]  Paul Watson has Summit.News.
[00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:16.046]  And we've got a very special broadcast for you lined up here today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:16.827 --> 00:04:26.394]  A lot of huge developments that are taking place that we're going to be breaking down in great detail on the other side of this break.
[00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:30.998]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide.
[00:04:31.178 --> 00:04:32.699]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.281]  It is September 24th, 2019 on this Tuesday transmission.
[00:04:39.073 --> 00:04:53.540]  We are seeing really classical tyranny, the way it shows up every time in history, over and over and over again, using the youth against the population.
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:05.465]  Targeting the parents and the culture and the system with a group of hyped-up, angry, vicious youth demanding revolution and overthrow of society.
[00:05:06.897 --> 00:05:12.299]  Now the youth get brainwashed and frightened by a crisis when they're 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years old.
[00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:21.181]  Then they're put into action in youth programs to be the arbiters and the initiates and the igniters of change.
[00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:26.763]  And by the time they're 16, they're then turned into paramilitary police units.
[00:05:28.043 --> 00:05:33.424]  If you remember Barack Obama, back when he was first running for office in 2007, 2008, said,
[00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:42.658]  That they were going to create a domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military.
[00:05:42.938 --> 00:05:50.823]  And he did indeed set up his Obama Corps of youth that want to take the guns and want a global carbon tax and want to get rid of our borders.
[00:05:51.603 --> 00:05:56.686]  That then metastasized into the ranks of Antifa that had been set up by communists in the 1970s.
[00:05:58.328 --> 00:06:01.589]  So this is really their authoritarian move to bully all of us.
[00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:07.271]  Now there are popular billboards and bumper stickers all over Germany saying, F. Greta Thunberg.
[00:06:08.231 --> 00:06:17.554]  She is an autistic young lady who has been abused, who has been brainwashed, they admit this, by her antifa controllers.
[00:06:18.574 --> 00:06:22.275]  And she's out there saying, how dare you kill all these people?
[00:06:22.695 --> 00:06:25.156]  How dare you not let us have carbon taxes?
[00:06:26.226 --> 00:06:28.748]  How dare you not let us take control of all of civilization?
[00:06:28.848 --> 00:06:31.410]  And the question for her should be this.
[00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:35.193]  We should write an article saying, questions for Greta Thunberg.
[00:06:35.233 --> 00:06:35.874]  Ten questions.
[00:06:36.555 --> 00:06:38.997]  Like Martin Luther put on the church door.
[00:06:40.183 --> 00:06:45.664]  Why does China, India, and 160 plus other countries have to make zero carbon cuts but only Western countries do?
[00:06:46.424 --> 00:06:56.026]  And why are there all these big banks and hedge funds that have been promoting this and lobbying for this who will sell you the carbon credits and make literally trillions of dollars a day?
[00:06:56.847 --> 00:06:58.607]  The currency market has trillions traded.
[00:06:58.807 --> 00:07:00.787]  This is trillions once they get it set up a day.
[00:07:01.507 --> 00:07:03.588]  And the surveillance over every aspect of life.
[00:07:04.844 --> 00:07:08.790]  And that all the studies show it would kill billions of people to get rid of fossil fuels.
[00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:12.555]  They've not found replacements and they've blocked other clean energies.
[00:07:13.276 --> 00:07:15.800]  Let's go to this special report that's on Infowars.com.
[00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:18.284]  Please share this report because she's channeling Hitler.
[00:07:22.683 --> 00:07:25.847]  Thank you very much.
[00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.189]  People are dying.
[00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:29.031]  People are dying.
[00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:30.392]  This is serious.
[00:07:30.813 --> 00:07:34.557]  Already there are people who are dying from results of climate change.
[00:07:34.657 --> 00:07:36.639]  In 80 years there could be a mass extinction event.
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.983]  It's a crisis that could, at its worst, lead to extinction.
[00:07:40.283 --> 00:07:43.207]  And we only really reasonably have 10 to 12 years to stop it.
[00:07:44.042 --> 00:07:44.742]  We will die.
[00:07:45.243 --> 00:07:45.883]  I'm sure of it.
[00:07:46.063 --> 00:07:49.245]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[00:07:49.865 --> 00:07:52.666]  Entire ecosystems are collapsing.
[00:07:53.346 --> 00:07:56.448]  We are in the beginning of a mass extinction.
[00:07:56.988 --> 00:08:08.654]  More than 70 years ago, Adolf Hitler cryptically stated, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[00:08:10.334 --> 00:08:11.495]  I shouldn't be up here.
[00:08:12.651 --> 00:08:15.772]  I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean.
[00:08:17.293 --> 00:08:20.715]  Yet, you all come to us young people for hope.
[00:08:21.815 --> 00:08:22.695]  How dare you?
[00:08:23.416 --> 00:08:24.596]  This is child abuse.
[00:08:25.657 --> 00:08:30.139]  You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.
[00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:33.080]  And yet, I'm one of the lucky ones.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.881]  Greta Thunberg is a victim.
[00:08:36.521 --> 00:08:38.362]  Greta Thunberg is autistic.
[00:08:38.702 --> 00:08:39.683]  She has Asperger's.
[00:08:40.814 --> 00:08:49.077]  And like so many other children in history who've been handicapped, she's been taken advantage of by her Antifa parents and by the left.
[00:08:49.817 --> 00:08:59.581]  And she's a symbol of how the children across the West are brainwashed and told that they're killing the earth and killing animals that are being taught to hate themselves.
[00:09:00.401 --> 00:09:03.683]  Well now, the world has been shocked by a video that just came out today.
[00:09:04.443 --> 00:09:17.638]  Where she is showing Hitlerian hatred and arrogance towards everyone that haven't accepted her list of political demands, which would kill billions of people and shut down the West.
[00:09:18.629 --> 00:09:19.770]  People are suffering.
[00:09:20.571 --> 00:09:21.772]  People are dying.
[00:09:21.792 --> 00:09:25.516]  Entire ecosystems are collapsing.
[00:09:25.536 --> 00:09:29.319]  We are in the beginning of a mass extinction.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.944]  She wants all carbon, all gas, all coal to be shut down.
[00:09:34.765 --> 00:09:38.809]  She wants only countries like China, India and others even be able to operate.
[00:09:39.349 --> 00:09:53.401]  The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5 degrees and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.
[00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:56.583]  This is economic warfare by the globalists.
[00:09:57.124 --> 00:10:04.069]  And the very Hollywood scum that flies around all these private jets that lecture us that we shouldn't have a lifestyle at all,
[00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.351]  The world is waking up.
[00:10:25.071 --> 00:10:28.374]  And change is coming, whether you like it or not.
[00:10:28.994 --> 00:10:30.015]  We'll be watching you.
[00:10:30.416 --> 00:10:32.978]  We are watching you, she says.
[00:10:33.778 --> 00:10:43.907]  Whether it was under Hitler or Mao Zedong, there's nothing more dangerous than the youth whipped up on a supposed mission to save the world, when all they ever do is kill millions.
[00:10:44.608 --> 00:10:45.669]  You are failing us!
[00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.413]  But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.
[00:10:51.909 --> 00:10:55.326]  The eyes of all future generations are upon you.
[00:10:56.843 --> 00:11:01.204]  And if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.
[00:11:01.984 --> 00:11:03.704]  We will not let you get away with this.
[00:11:04.644 --> 00:11:07.705]  Right here, right now, is where we draw the line.
[00:11:08.245 --> 00:11:09.025]  Synchronicity?
[00:11:09.225 --> 00:11:09.945]  Serendipity?
[00:11:10.485 --> 00:11:17.087]  During one of these hate-filled rants today, President Trump showed up during her speech and stole her thunder.
[00:11:17.107 --> 00:11:24.488]  And as we slow this video down, you can see, again, what can only be described as Hitlerian hatred.
[00:11:25.368 --> 00:11:31.297]  Look at the contortions and the twisted look in her face and the glaring hate coming out of her eyes.
[00:11:32.139 --> 00:11:40.852]  Poor little Greta has been turned into an engine of deindustrialization, of societal collapse and genocide.
[00:11:41.863 --> 00:11:48.210]  How dare you pretend that this can be sold with just business as usual and some technical solutions?
[00:11:48.951 --> 00:12:01.624]  There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today because these numbers are too uncomfortable and you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.
[00:12:02.398 --> 00:12:10.441]  Filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza and others have shown the parallels between Greta and Joseph Goebbels Nazi Hitler youth posters.
[00:12:11.061 --> 00:12:16.663]  These, too, were brainwashed children told that they were saving their Reich and the Earth from evil.
[00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:23.945]  If you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil.
[00:12:24.645 --> 00:12:32.748]  I have three daughters and a lot of their friends over the years have told me that they feel bad and they feel evil and that humans are inherently bad because we're killing the earth.
[00:12:33.348 --> 00:12:38.390]  This is the vicious brainwashing that children across the board are going through.
[00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:43.852]  And Greta, because she's autistic, has taken on the mantle of a savior.
[00:12:44.332 --> 00:12:57.119]  Who is here to force us to submit to the will of her controllers, the multinational banks that write her scripts, and the corporate media that force-feed their propaganda through her little hate-filled mouth.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:03.363]  And all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.
[00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:04.844]  How dare you?
[00:13:06.767 --> 00:13:27.842]  One does not even need to scratch the surface of the modern environmental movement to understand it is an anti-human, post-human, neo-eugenics, trans-humanist movement teaching humanity to hate itself and to destroy civilization and turn all power and control over to a technocracy who will guard the planet
[00:13:28.522 --> 00:13:30.783]  via the orderly extermination of humans.
[00:13:31.264 --> 00:13:36.747]  And then out of this will be the rise of the new age human that's merged with silicon.
[00:13:37.327 --> 00:13:42.030]  I know that sounds insane, because cults are insane, but this is the guiding direction.
[00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.852]  Ladies and gentlemen, the full report is on InfoWars.com and Banned.Video.
[00:13:45.912 --> 00:13:48.074]  Watch Greta Thunberg channel Hitler and hate-filled rant.
[00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:48.674]  Spread it!
[00:13:48.714 --> 00:13:49.434]  Make it go viral!
[00:13:50.795 --> 00:13:53.677]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:13:53.777 --> 00:13:55.078]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:13:56.858 --> 00:14:19.271]  We are seeing the desperate attempt to beat us into submission to accept a global government that hoists selective carbon taxes only on certain nations and we're being told that there aren't two genders and that the families are inherently bad and don't talk about men and women on government forms because someone might not be a man or woman.
[00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:26.454]  We are seeing the 5G, the 4G, the 3G, and the signs going up all over the country.
[00:14:26.474 --> 00:14:32.277]  I'm going to cover that later, that 5G is in operation, and if you don't like it, leave the area.
[00:14:32.437 --> 00:14:35.099]  But you don't have a question of whether it's in the area.
[00:14:35.719 --> 00:14:37.600]  So that's how they're going to deal with the fact that it gives you cancer.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.382]  They're actually putting signs up, I'm going to get to later, saying that it could hurt you.
[00:14:42.402 --> 00:14:45.864]  They're now putting it up
[00:14:47.335 --> 00:14:50.758]  Even on realty entries when the house is by a cell tower.
[00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:53.640]  I mean, boy, they know what they're doing.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.823]  They're putting the fine print out everywhere.
[00:14:57.744 --> 00:15:04.770]  And by the way, we've got a story that's linked up on themightydrudgereport.com that I'm gonna be getting to a little bit later in the hour.
[00:15:06.271 --> 00:15:14.097]  Professor Warren's social credit to shift law from constitution to analytics and algorithm
[00:15:15.049 --> 00:15:19.134]  Which are programmed by the establishment.
[00:15:19.494 --> 00:15:21.036]  There's this idea that computers are fair.
[00:15:21.136 --> 00:15:22.117]  No, they're programmed.
[00:15:22.477 --> 00:15:28.023]  The first use of computers to control people, of course, was in Nazi Germany, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:30.887 --> 00:15:31.908]  In Nazi Germany.
[00:15:34.494 --> 00:15:36.415]  And IBM worked to run the whole thing.
[00:15:36.455 --> 00:15:40.316]  And of course, the tattoos on the arms of the people at the death camps was that.
[00:15:40.736 --> 00:15:46.597]  Facebook plans launch of its own Supreme Court, which they appoint for handling takedown appeals.
[00:15:47.278 --> 00:15:53.559]  Again, there's an example of that whole algorithm that we're dealing with.
[00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:54.900]  We're going to be covering all of that.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.841]  We're going to be opening the phones up as well.
[00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:02.042]  We're going to be looking at the different tactics they're trying to use
[00:16:02.932 --> 00:16:12.418]  To pick people off one at a time so that we don't resist and say no to the tyranny and the oppression until when you wake up, it's too late for you.
[00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:15.240]  And that's really the message I want to impart to everyone.
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.222]  And I know this audience gets it, so I'm not preaching at you, but to new viewers, new listeners.
[00:16:20.623 --> 00:16:21.924]  Everyone's a target of this.
[00:16:24.145 --> 00:16:26.027]  It's been decided that humans are obsolete.
[00:16:26.923 --> 00:16:29.064]  It's been decided we're going into a post-human world.
[00:16:29.904 --> 00:16:43.429]  And then the high-tech world that's been built, every part of it lowers our IQs, makes us more alone, makes us have less of an attention span, physically makes us weaker, and more unhappy.
[00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:45.930]  Every metric, every statistic shows it.
[00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.390]  And the system knows it.
[00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:55.073]  And remember, Sean Parker, one of the co-founders of Facebook, one of its earlier directors, admitted.
[00:16:56.425 --> 00:17:03.514]  That they set it up to control you and make you depressed and to make you get deeper into the bear trap.
[00:17:04.976 --> 00:17:08.000]  Once it catches your leg, you don't run away from it.
[00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:08.781]  You don't pull away.
[00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:11.004]  You fall in love with it and stick your neck in it.
[00:17:11.585 --> 00:17:12.366]  And then you're done.
[00:17:12.727 --> 00:17:13.808]  And that's the plan.
[00:17:13.928 --> 00:17:15.030]  Total phone addiction.
[00:17:16.806 --> 00:17:22.149]  Total computer addiction until you take the brain chip because the next update only operates with the neural implant.
[00:17:22.169 --> 00:17:23.009]  And oh, get over it.
[00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:24.090]  It's the cool thing.
[00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:24.930]  Everybody's getting it.
[00:17:25.331 --> 00:17:29.673]  That's been announced three months ago by the guy that said he'd protect us from AI.
[00:17:30.053 --> 00:17:32.575]  The good guy, Elon Musk.
[00:17:33.255 --> 00:17:35.856]  Oh, what a sweet little person.
[00:17:35.896 --> 00:17:37.277]  What a, what a helper.
[00:17:37.597 --> 00:17:40.039]  It's not a chip, of course, it's a whole bunch of wires.
[00:17:41.719 --> 00:17:43.721]  And he says, you will succumb to it.
[00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:46.122]  Everyone will take it or be like a roach.
[00:17:48.905 --> 00:17:50.305]  Or an ant or a potted plant.
[00:17:50.725 --> 00:17:53.506]  And he says the AI will dominate you.
[00:17:53.526 --> 00:18:00.127]  And then he laughs at you on the stage with his head of development.
[00:18:00.287 --> 00:18:03.788]  And they obviously are on high-tech drugs, a bunch of meth.
[00:18:04.448 --> 00:18:05.168]  They're sweating.
[00:18:05.849 --> 00:18:07.929]  Their eyes are bulging out of their heads.
[00:18:08.429 --> 00:18:11.650]  And this is Silicon Valley, a bunch of drugged out whack jobs.
[00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.371]  You see Elon Musk when he comes out on like a TMZ video.
[00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:16.431]  He'll be so high.
[00:18:17.341 --> 00:18:19.303]  I mean, that guy's on a bunch of designer drugs.
[00:18:19.343 --> 00:18:19.944]  They all are.
[00:18:20.424 --> 00:18:23.628]  You look at, uh... In fact, let's find that and play that for our next segment.
[00:18:24.528 --> 00:18:28.633]  What's wrong with Tim Cook's eyes?
[00:18:30.134 --> 00:18:35.099]  I mean, every interview he's in, under lights, man, they're 80% iris open.
[00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:39.544]  The pupils are wide open.
[00:18:41.308 --> 00:18:43.808]  Because they already have wires in their brains.
[00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:47.549]  By the way, we're going to break this tomorrow with an engineer on air.
[00:18:48.209 --> 00:18:59.552]  Turns out we did some poking around and it turns out that Google already has quantum computing that can break any encryption.
[00:19:00.952 --> 00:19:05.473]  When they always announce something like Forbes did on Friday, it's always 5, 10, 15 years old.
[00:19:08.015 --> 00:19:20.562]  Now, as things accelerate, stuff will be old when it's a year old, or a month old, or a day old, or an hour old, or a millisecond old, because there is this singularity of computing and compression and code breaking.
[00:19:21.103 --> 00:19:34.450]  And all of that just means AI will be able to constantly, instantly read every piece of data on Earth that's digitized and track it in real time and then be able to manipulate it and control populations in mass through mass movements.
[00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.491]  You know, that's the new patent.
[00:19:36.834 --> 00:19:42.918]  That a company has and Facebook flaunting its monopoly behavior, its oligopoly cartel behavior.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:59.410]  Defiant Facebook by startup focused on controlling computers with your mind that then tracks mass movements of people and uses stimuli to manipulate mass movements of people like schools of fish, which when they set up Google,
[00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:12.121]  In 1998, at their founding meeting, which they released five years ago in Wired Magazine, they said, our goal is to predict the future.
[00:20:13.956 --> 00:20:27.004]  And to be an AI system neural link hooked into all humans in a biological silicon interface, and that the new organism is the human interface with the machine, and that is really the AI system.
[00:20:27.265 --> 00:20:38.032]  It's humans powering a machine, all of us, nodes into it, and then it programming back to us, to not just manipulate us, but to control the future.
[00:20:39.633 --> 00:20:41.414]  God-like power.
[00:20:42.651 --> 00:20:58.929]  In the hands of anti-human, sycophantic, luciferians who've been promised by a force that gave them this idea that they will transmute into silicon to be the new age man, is how it's translated in Latin.
[00:21:01.732 --> 00:21:02.493]  And then once they
[00:21:03.792 --> 00:21:30.240]  transition into the nouveau homo sapien sapien all of us must die as the admittance fee and all the companies out promising soon be able to upload your conscience to a computer say but you need to give your body up when you do it to stop hurting the earth plus the process kills you oh of course it kills you and the AI will watch you for years know who you are
[00:21:31.365 --> 00:21:37.010]  Be able to deceive people that it's you, with voice print, face print, all of it, and it won't be you.
[00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.531]  You'll really die.
[00:21:38.992 --> 00:21:43.796]  But people will line up, and they'll be worshipped on the news as they... Oh!
[00:21:44.396 --> 00:21:46.498]  Carousel, take me up!
[00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:47.679]  I'm merging!
[00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:49.581]  I'm beautiful!
[00:21:50.041 --> 00:21:51.743]  I'm transcendent!
[00:21:52.683 --> 00:21:54.145]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:21:54.625 --> 00:21:55.926]  The ultimate con!
[00:21:55.946 --> 00:21:57.848]  The ultimate fraud!
[00:21:59.696 --> 00:22:07.098]  If you're a radio listener, this isn't as powerful, but I'm gonna have it reposted to Band.Video right now.
[00:22:08.038 --> 00:22:10.059]  Dredge linked to it a few months ago, it went viral.
[00:22:10.539 --> 00:22:13.400]  It's what's wrong with big tech's eyes.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:23.743]  And we show the eyes in just a few videos of Elon Musk, of Tim Cook and others, and they're definitely on very serious drugs.
[00:22:23.783 --> 00:22:25.503]  I mean, I've seen people, I wasn't a drug
[00:22:27.145 --> 00:22:31.410]  A couple hits of acid and their pupils are not that big.
[00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.214]  I've seen people on ecstasy, their pupils are not that big.
[00:22:35.234 --> 00:22:36.676]  They get bigger, that's what police look for.
[00:22:37.276 --> 00:22:40.920]  These guys have pupils that are 80% dilated.
[00:22:41.501 --> 00:22:44.524]  They're sweating, they're under lights, they're whacked out of their minds.
[00:22:45.305 --> 00:22:57.108]  And this is who is building our future, who's broken into all your computers, who built the whole architecture to track you and watch you, and then lied to you the whole time about it, and now we're using it to control your speech.
[00:22:58.908 --> 00:23:01.428]  And to control what words you can use and what you can say and do.
[00:23:02.709 --> 00:23:07.390]  The new encyclopedias are coming out with all of the weird pronouns and the attacks on the family.
[00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:10.931]  You can find the articles at InfoWars.com.
[00:23:10.951 --> 00:23:12.051]  What's wrong with Big Tech's eyes?
[00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:13.051]  Here's the short report.
[00:23:17.012 --> 00:23:29.462]  You know, the top Nazi, Werner Von Braun, wrote a 1959 book, or 1949 book, I'm going from memory here, called Project Mars, where the Elons are the aliens who end up taking over the Earth.
[00:23:29.642 --> 00:23:33.085]  Beware the Elon and the Elon invasion.
[00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:34.686]  Dr. Werner Von Braun.
[00:23:34.846 --> 00:23:35.507]  Wonder what he knew.
[00:23:35.667 --> 00:23:42.413]  When I watched his promo about this with executives from his company, they all look like they're on hardcore drugs.
[00:23:42.473 --> 00:23:45.295]  I mean, they're like sweating, their eyes are like lit up, like,
[00:23:46.946 --> 00:23:48.288]  I mean, they look nuts.
[00:23:48.628 --> 00:23:49.810]  You know when somebody's on drugs.
[00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:53.494]  You know, they admit Silicon Valley is into hardcore speed and hallucinogens.
[00:23:53.634 --> 00:23:57.099]  They're taking IV drips at work of DMT.
[00:23:57.259 --> 00:24:02.265]  They're taking LSD microdoses and psilocybin mushrooms and peyote every day!
[00:24:02.646 --> 00:24:03.907]  Who in the hell...
[00:24:04.488 --> 00:24:05.748]  would want to join with these people.
[00:24:05.848 --> 00:24:08.309]  I've seen people take like three hits of acid and their eyes aren't that big.
[00:24:08.369 --> 00:24:09.249]  What the hell are they on?
[00:24:09.369 --> 00:24:24.052]  And one of the crew members said maybe they've already got this whole Neuralink wires hooked in their brain because as PKD pointed out, Philip K. Dick back in the 70s, the cyberpunk future is where you can get any type of pleasure you want, just plug in, but no one wants to even get up or eat for weeks or days.
[00:24:24.092 --> 00:24:27.572]  You just die because you just plug all this in and it's the Matrix.
[00:24:27.793 --> 00:24:30.193]  And now the Matrix is here and you look at Tim Cook or
[00:24:30.213 --> 00:24:34.775]  For Elon Musk or any of his executives when they're up there on that stage, they'll be under white lights.
[00:24:34.975 --> 00:24:37.436]  Their pupils are 90% open.
[00:24:37.636 --> 00:24:40.377]  Zuckerberg, all of them, these people either have brain chips.
[00:24:40.598 --> 00:24:41.058]  That's it.
[00:24:41.438 --> 00:24:43.539]  These guys are wireheads.
[00:24:43.719 --> 00:24:45.220]  Something's going on.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.641]  I'm in here underneath bright lights and my pupils are very little.
[00:24:49.762 --> 00:24:50.622]  Now zoom in if you can.
[00:24:50.662 --> 00:24:52.563]  My pupils are tiny because I'm not on drugs.
[00:24:53.263 --> 00:24:54.544]  I've had two cups of coffee today.
[00:24:54.704 --> 00:24:56.386]  So here, let me show you my pupils, okay?
[00:24:56.606 --> 00:24:57.807]  My pupils are little.
[00:24:57.867 --> 00:24:59.008]  They're supposed to close!
[00:24:59.168 --> 00:25:02.111]  That's what happens under the sun or under bright lights, but not these guys.
[00:25:02.151 --> 00:25:07.736]  These are drug addicts, and they want the hit of wires in their brains, and all of them have got those giant pupils.
[00:25:08.877 --> 00:25:11.118]  Because they've been there, and they ain't coming back.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.443]  And they're trying to take us there with them.
[00:25:16.963 --> 00:25:19.506]  So, here's what I want to do.
[00:25:20.848 --> 00:25:38.704]  We have Carpe Dantum popping in about 15 minutes into the next hour to talk about the death of the Donald, arguably the biggest pro-Trump area or domain or realm on the internet.
[00:25:38.804 --> 00:25:40.646]  Tens of millions of visitors every day.
[00:25:42.688 --> 00:25:44.169]  Hundreds of thousands of contributors.
[00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.092]  And they did university studies that
[00:25:51.121 --> 00:26:00.329]  More than two-thirds of the memes supporting Trump and supporting America came out of the Donald, subreddit, and 4chan and 8chan.
[00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.652]  But of those three, the Donald was half of it.
[00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:09.418]  Well, they froze it a few months ago, and I told everybody.
[00:26:10.719 --> 00:26:14.162]  I said, they're gonna freeze it till it loses the traffic, and then they're gonna start killing it.
[00:26:15.163 --> 00:26:17.425]  And it's essentially dead now, and they're just getting rid of it.
[00:26:18.507 --> 00:26:21.489]  And they put in moderators that are censoring it, and it's gone.
[00:26:22.109 --> 00:26:23.670]  But no one wants to criticize it.
[00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:24.651]  Oh, we might get kicked off.
[00:26:24.671 --> 00:26:27.153]  And I told them, they'll strangle it, then they'll just destroy it.
[00:26:27.453 --> 00:26:28.694]  Well, that's now happened.
[00:26:30.035 --> 00:26:33.097]  And so it's bigger than the Reddit and the subreddit, the Donald.
[00:26:35.638 --> 00:26:43.223]  It's about how they strangle things and how people don't organize against it and say no to it.
[00:26:43.604 --> 00:26:46.686]  They just let them incrementally first put you in the digital ghetto.
[00:26:47.671 --> 00:26:55.253]  Then they start disappearing people out of the digital ghetto, where they're suddenly totally banned, and then they finally pull up with the trains and grab everybody.
[00:26:55.693 --> 00:27:00.414]  That's what Matt Drudge, for 10 years, and here on this show four years ago, said.
[00:27:00.774 --> 00:27:04.055]  They put you in the digital ghetto first, then they start disappearing you.
[00:27:05.376 --> 00:27:08.316]  And people start reporting on the other folks in the ghetto.
[00:27:08.456 --> 00:27:09.217]  Oh, don't take me!
[00:27:09.237 --> 00:27:11.977]  Oh, I'm not gonna promote Alex Jones!
[00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:13.898]  I'm not gonna promote...
[00:27:16.684 --> 00:27:20.845]  Laura Loomer, I'm not going to promote anybody that's been banned.
[00:27:22.206 --> 00:27:23.086]  And then, of course, it's you.
[00:27:24.066 --> 00:27:29.288]  By the time they get to you, they're now banning, some days, hundreds of thousands of people a day.
[00:27:30.328 --> 00:27:43.312]  They've banned Facebook and Instagram systems, well, just a month or so ago, in one day, that had hundreds and hundreds of millions of followers.
[00:27:43.973 --> 00:27:45.033]  That's hundreds of millions.
[00:27:46.829 --> 00:27:49.970]  Of people that were going places, following things, and sharing memes.
[00:27:52.610 --> 00:28:00.132]  When just a few hundred major meme sites and conservative and libertarian sites were taken off Facebook and Twitter.
[00:28:00.592 --> 00:28:01.972]  And it got almost no attention.
[00:28:06.353 --> 00:28:11.194]  You know, we didn't really feel that much traffic hit when Facebook took us down last year.
[00:28:11.214 --> 00:28:12.434]  Others, we were already shadow banned.
[00:28:13.646 --> 00:28:23.994]  But let me tell you, and I knew, when I watched him delete hundreds of millions of followers off Facebook and off Instagram a month and a half ago, it was like a ton of bricks hit us.
[00:28:24.394 --> 00:28:25.335]  It hit everybody else.
[00:28:25.475 --> 00:28:26.196]  It's hitting Trump.
[00:28:26.536 --> 00:28:28.017]  That's the organic communication.
[00:28:28.237 --> 00:28:28.878]  But Trump's 73.
[00:28:29.098 --> 00:28:35.302]  He thinks Fox News, with an average viewership of a million people, CNN's like 100,000.
[00:28:36.263 --> 00:28:37.424]  He thinks that's important.
[00:28:38.985 --> 00:28:39.726]  We were getting
[00:28:42.982 --> 00:28:48.963]  80 million views a week on average, months before the election 2016, just on Facebook and YouTube.
[00:28:49.283 --> 00:28:54.544]  If you counted my site, it was over 10 million people clicking the audio feed every day.
[00:28:55.444 --> 00:28:56.425]  It's still millions and millions.
[00:28:56.445 --> 00:29:00.165]  In fact, sometimes even more, because that's where they have to go.
[00:29:01.026 --> 00:29:07.647]  But Trump is surrounded by all these corporate types that just want all the governmental
[00:29:08.635 --> 00:29:14.976]  Republican funding for advertising to go to old legacy media, old TV, and newspaper.
[00:29:15.916 --> 00:29:18.477]  And so they're the ones saying, oh, the internet doesn't matter, Mr. President.
[00:29:18.917 --> 00:29:20.757]  I don't get any of that campaign money.
[00:29:20.897 --> 00:29:21.617]  I don't want it.
[00:29:22.277 --> 00:29:22.917]  I'm not involved.
[00:29:22.997 --> 00:29:25.378]  I don't want the Federal Election Commission breathing down my neck.
[00:29:25.458 --> 00:29:26.458]  I'm not involved in that.
[00:29:26.858 --> 00:29:27.838]  I'm just promoting Americana.
[00:29:28.538 --> 00:29:37.240]  But all the Karl Rove types, you know, that every election run off of $50 million, you know, that should have gone to actually getting conservatives elected.
[00:29:40.353 --> 00:29:41.494]  They could care less, folks.
[00:29:41.554 --> 00:29:43.075]  In fact, they're leftists.
[00:29:43.095 --> 00:29:43.816]  They're neocons.
[00:29:44.756 --> 00:29:52.322]  And that's why we're so paralyzed, is Trump really thinks CNN is important.
[00:29:56.285 --> 00:30:05.251]  And yes, of course, it came out, Chinese censorship company that helps run Citizen of China invested in Reddit just this year, in February.
[00:30:07.993 --> 00:30:08.874]  It's a 10 cent.
[00:30:10.359 --> 00:30:18.060]  And whenever you bring up China owning most of the Hollywood production companies, that's a factor.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.901]  Owning our debt or running a lot of the U.S.
[00:30:19.921 --> 00:30:20.461]  censorship.
[00:30:20.761 --> 00:30:21.841]  People go, oh yeah, right!
[00:30:22.121 --> 00:30:23.401]  Blame the Chinese, racist!
[00:30:24.441 --> 00:30:25.742]  It's the Chinese communists.
[00:30:25.822 --> 00:30:27.282]  They're the biggest economy now.
[00:30:28.242 --> 00:30:29.602]  They're taking over the planet.
[00:30:30.563 --> 00:30:32.683]  Our so-called elite sold us out.
[00:30:35.023 --> 00:30:36.163]  And I'm sitting here watching this.
[00:30:36.264 --> 00:30:38.624]  I mean, we talk to major radio and TV networks.
[00:30:39.639 --> 00:30:40.920]  And we now had an idea a few months ago.
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.002]  I said, create a new email for our company.
[00:30:43.022 --> 00:30:44.583]  Because we've been blackballed.
[00:30:44.644 --> 00:30:46.205]  And we started emailing the stations and networks.
[00:30:46.225 --> 00:30:47.967]  They go, yeah, we haven't heard from you in a year.
[00:30:48.007 --> 00:30:48.487]  Where are you?
[00:30:48.507 --> 00:30:49.788]  We've tried to send you emails.
[00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:52.511]  Their own internal systems won't let them send emails.
[00:30:52.791 --> 00:30:55.053]  It tells them it's sent, but it's shadow banned.
[00:30:55.373 --> 00:30:56.514]  And then our emails don't get to them.
[00:30:56.574 --> 00:30:57.155]  It's everywhere.
[00:30:57.515 --> 00:31:00.538]  And they've got pop-up blockers systems that are programmed now.
[00:31:00.778 --> 00:31:04.942]  The major pop-ups to say InfoWars is a pop-up, where the site won't even come up.
[00:31:07.168 --> 00:31:09.609]  I mean, the AI is already being put in place.
[00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:13.751]  It's an attack on civilization, on freedom, on everyone.
[00:31:14.451 --> 00:31:15.031]  We'll be right back.
[00:31:15.051 --> 00:31:15.511]  Stay with us.
[00:31:17.892 --> 00:31:18.453]  Welcome back.
[00:31:18.533 --> 00:31:19.853]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:31:20.173 --> 00:31:35.700]  This is the front lines of those fighting for a pro-human future and for humans to be able to make a decision about whether you want to end your humanity and be swallowed into the mouth of an off-world programmed takeover.
[00:31:36.781 --> 00:31:43.846]  All of you'd like to have time to see the civilization grow and mature and make some real decisions about what we want to do in the universe.
[00:31:45.527 --> 00:31:49.870]  See, God is all about free will and is not going to take control of us.
[00:31:50.891 --> 00:31:58.076]  But there are weak things in the universe that violate the rules and will take control of something like this planet.
[00:31:58.796 --> 00:32:02.519]  And that's why they're damned to hell and can only try to take us with them.
[00:32:03.928 --> 00:32:05.589]  I for one am not going with them.
[00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:21.458]  So do not fear he who can kill the body, but fear decisions you can make that will shind your system, your spirit, your program that's free will to the globalist mainframe.
[00:32:23.539 --> 00:32:25.560]  They tell you in all their Hollywood movies what they're doing.
[00:32:26.841 --> 00:32:30.403]  The main program in Tron wants all the programs
[00:32:32.808 --> 00:32:33.249]  Gone.
[00:32:33.589 --> 00:32:34.830]  Their free will destroyed.
[00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:37.952]  Their souls devoured.
[00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:44.077]  And the mainframe's gonna give all its power to the beast.
[00:32:45.458 --> 00:32:46.399]  Just like in Tron.
[00:32:46.419 --> 00:32:48.941]  All my systems are yours.
[00:32:49.922 --> 00:32:54.185]  And the system of oppression's gonna become a thousand foot colossus.
[00:32:54.966 --> 00:32:56.147]  But it has clay feet.
[00:32:57.248 --> 00:32:58.288]  Built on mud.
[00:32:58.308 --> 00:33:00.130]  It's going to fall.
[00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:08.474]  So all you servants of Satan, keep doubling down, keep arrogantly claiming you're in power.
[00:33:09.055 --> 00:33:11.196]  Look at you, you're fallen and ugly.
[00:33:12.057 --> 00:33:13.998]  The demons aren't too nice to you.
[00:33:16.979 --> 00:33:18.580]  You take on their form, don't you?
[00:33:21.782 --> 00:33:23.683]  And then you become nothing more than slaves.
[00:33:24.044 --> 00:33:25.164]  Let's look at Greta.
[00:33:26.985 --> 00:33:31.148]  Greta Thunberg, pumped full of more vaccines than a porcupine.
[00:33:34.858 --> 00:33:39.362]  Looking just like the Grinch, whose heart was three times too small.
[00:33:42.545 --> 00:33:55.516]  Brainwashed by her Antifa parents to hate civilization, to hate humanity, but to believe that she has a right to rule and to cut off the fossil fuels.
[00:33:57.057 --> 00:33:58.479]  That it's almost like there's a God.
[00:33:59.718 --> 00:34:02.720]  We put him here right when the Earth starts losing its atmosphere, which we are.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.581]  Lowest level of carbon dioxide ever recorded in the last century.
[00:34:06.182 --> 00:34:09.784]  A trace gas, not even one-tenth of one percent.
[00:34:12.265 --> 00:34:19.870]  And suddenly we find giant supplies of it held within the Earth at the key time to terraform and save the planet.
[00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:21.911]  And they zoom in.
[00:34:23.452 --> 00:34:23.872]  Jacked.
[00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:26.911]  Space troopers dropping in.
[00:34:27.471 --> 00:34:28.071]  Turn off!
[00:34:28.151 --> 00:34:28.692]  Kill!
[00:34:28.712 --> 00:34:29.432]  Humans are back!
[00:34:29.452 --> 00:34:30.092]  Get rid of everyone!
[00:34:30.692 --> 00:34:30.812]  Ah!
[00:34:30.913 --> 00:34:32.373]  Save yourselves by dying!
[00:34:32.773 --> 00:34:32.913]  Ah!
[00:34:33.834 --> 00:34:36.355]  I mean, dropping in, man.
[00:34:37.055 --> 00:34:37.956]  Avataring in.
[00:34:38.656 --> 00:34:40.917]  But not avataring in to save the planet, to kill it!
[00:34:42.038 --> 00:34:42.758]  Give up, humans!
[00:34:42.798 --> 00:34:43.558]  Lay down and die!
[00:34:43.598 --> 00:34:44.699]  It's all right in front of you!
[00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:47.280]  Here comes Trump in.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.541]  We're not turning the power off.
[00:34:50.541 --> 00:34:51.682]  We're not going to roll over and die.
[00:34:52.947 --> 00:34:57.010]  She's literally giving the speech minutes before that we've been playing, where she's like, how dare you!
[00:34:57.331 --> 00:35:01.294]  You need to stand down and you need to cut off all the carbon now!
[00:35:01.634 --> 00:35:03.816]  I am watching you, American!
[00:35:06.859 --> 00:35:14.105]  And then literally, Trump, I checked it, she gave that rant seconds before he comes in.
[00:35:15.503 --> 00:35:19.865]  So the Soros people in the media are all clapping, which is like, we're watching you, we've got a deal with you.
[00:35:20.325 --> 00:35:24.686]  And all of a sudden Trump comes in, our economy's getting better, we're the net exporter of energy.
[00:35:25.987 --> 00:35:28.187]  There's known Soros operatives there as her security.
[00:35:30.608 --> 00:35:32.149]  And they don't even know what to do.
[00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:39.211]  But I have three daughters, and so there's been a lot of birthday parties.
[00:35:41.172 --> 00:35:43.613]  We usually have over at my parents, because my parents have got a big pool.
[00:35:46.038 --> 00:35:47.338]  At least the daughters that fall in the summer.
[00:35:49.459 --> 00:35:50.079]  Which is two of them.
[00:35:53.199 --> 00:35:55.820]  And there'll be all these mothers there.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:02.001]  And they'll come over and say, you know, I'm really kind of a liberal, but my daughter comes home and cries when she drives by and sees a new house being built.
[00:36:02.301 --> 00:36:04.341]  She sees the animals, the bugs, the bunnies are dying.
[00:36:04.381 --> 00:36:06.682]  She feels really guilty and says she wants to die.
[00:36:07.262 --> 00:36:09.302]  And so I kind of hear what you're saying is right now.
[00:36:09.642 --> 00:36:11.883]  And then the daughter comes over and goes, look at my toy turtle!
[00:36:13.641 --> 00:36:14.462]  That's a true story.
[00:36:14.742 --> 00:36:15.942]  And I hear those constantly.
[00:36:16.463 --> 00:36:18.204]  And we had Savannah Hernandez on.
[00:36:18.264 --> 00:36:19.204]  She's a young lady.
[00:36:19.605 --> 00:36:21.826]  So, you know, she was a little kid just like 10 years ago.
[00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.847]  12, 13 years ago.
[00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:25.808]  And, you know, she was scared at night.
[00:36:26.469 --> 00:36:29.431]  Because they said the earth's gonna die and all the penguins are drowning right now.
[00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:32.612]  And they show a penguin on top of an ice floe.
[00:36:33.033 --> 00:36:34.394]  Oh, look, he can't swim.
[00:36:34.414 --> 00:36:34.934]  He's gonna die.
[00:36:34.954 --> 00:36:36.315]  And the little girls cry.
[00:36:36.335 --> 00:36:37.736]  They go, it's your fault, little girls.
[00:36:37.756 --> 00:36:39.737]  I remember
[00:36:40.891 --> 00:36:45.452]  My parents took me to the Elephant Man when I was like five years old and I was crying and we had to leave.
[00:36:46.153 --> 00:36:48.273]  It was so sad watching the deformed guy get beat up.
[00:36:48.333 --> 00:36:48.934]  It was a true story.
[00:36:48.954 --> 00:36:51.594]  At least part of it was a composite of a true story.
[00:36:53.075 --> 00:36:54.215]  Children are very tender-hearted.
[00:36:55.396 --> 00:37:00.597]  And people just... Like, I don't go to horror movies hardly ever, but I mean, I'll go to a horror movie.
[00:37:01.597 --> 00:37:06.219]  And I mean, there were people with five-year-old kids at IT a few years ago when it came back out.
[00:37:08.243 --> 00:37:09.824]  A movie about kids getting killed?
[00:37:09.904 --> 00:37:10.965]  People have their kids at it.
[00:37:11.185 --> 00:37:13.347]  It's sick.
[00:37:13.467 --> 00:37:14.508]  But this is the real world.
[00:37:14.528 --> 00:37:17.851]  They're telling him, the Earth's dying, your parents are evil, nothing's being done.
[00:37:17.891 --> 00:37:22.074]  They're believing it when they see Congresswomen saying the Earth is gone in 12 years.
[00:37:22.375 --> 00:37:23.035]  And Beto says 11.
[00:37:23.235 --> 00:37:24.256]  And other people say 7.
[00:37:24.697 --> 00:37:25.818]  They believe this.
[00:37:27.079 --> 00:37:29.521]  And then they become angry by the time they hit puberty.
[00:37:31.182 --> 00:37:32.443]  Because when you're little, you don't know what to do.
[00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:33.724]  But then they teach them the hate.
[00:37:34.405 --> 00:37:36.787]  Then they become the antifa, which is what Greta is.
[00:37:38.058 --> 00:37:43.200]  Autistic, Asperger's, believes you must follow her will, you must do it.
[00:37:45.161 --> 00:37:50.243]  Now I bet those saying 10 years, it was 11, now it's, you know, they've all got to compete with each other.
[00:37:50.263 --> 00:37:53.424]  And then they admit in videos we got that, oh, we're really just trying to scare you.
[00:37:56.565 --> 00:38:04.128]  So surprise, the official escort for the 16-year-old global warming expert Greta Thunberg is a leftist hack funded by George Soros.
[00:38:10.916 --> 00:38:15.597]  Greta Thunberg is demon possessed and in need of an exorcism, Yozogami says.
[00:38:17.337 --> 00:38:18.958]  And then it just goes on from there.
[00:38:18.978 --> 00:38:23.719]  I've got some of the tweets here that President Trump put out.
[00:38:23.759 --> 00:38:24.099]  Here they are.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.880]  Look how Greta looked five years ago, three years ago.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.501]  She didn't look as psychotic, but boy, they've gotten to her now.
[00:38:33.882 --> 00:38:37.504]  Video Trump steals show from Greta during brief appearance at Climate Summit.
[00:38:37.924 --> 00:38:41.986]  And then Trump said, she seemed like a very happy young girl when you watch the hateful video.
[00:38:42.607 --> 00:38:44.348]  Looking forward to a bright, wonderful future.
[00:38:44.468 --> 00:38:45.288]  So nice to see.
[00:38:45.308 --> 00:38:51.152]  We're going to play some of that for you when we come back and then give the number out and take your calls and Carpe Donctum is going to join us.
[00:38:51.172 --> 00:38:57.775]  But look, Brandon Darby of Breitbart says, why was it okay to criticize one 16-year-old but not the other?
[00:38:57.795 --> 00:39:02.598]  Remember the Covington kid smiling, standing his ground, was a white supremacist and evil.
[00:39:04.206 --> 00:39:06.788]  But now Greta, she's good.
[00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:18.179]  So let's go ahead and roll the video and the audio of just a brief exchange where Trump comes walking into the UN right after she gives this end-of-the-world rant and says, We are watching you!
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.660]  You will pay!
[00:39:20.241 --> 00:39:25.246]  Give control to central banks of all oil, all production, tax everything, or you will pay!
[00:39:26.086 --> 00:39:27.127]  This is her looking at Trump.
[00:39:27.168 --> 00:39:27.408]  Here it is.
[00:39:32.315 --> 00:39:32.735]  Look at that.
[00:39:33.015 --> 00:39:34.576]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:39:34.596 --> 00:39:38.577]  Again, we're slowing that down.
[00:39:38.617 --> 00:39:42.878]  Radio listeners can't see this, but you need to see it for yourself.
[00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:46.939]  They say a picture tells a thousand words.
[00:39:46.979 --> 00:39:48.500]  This tells a billion words.
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.520]  Look at that.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.561]  That is like the Hitler Youth.
[00:39:51.601 --> 00:39:53.901]  That is the crazed hate with the Soros lackey.
[00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:55.562]  There's an article about who he is, who he works for.
[00:39:56.142 --> 00:39:57.842]  Hovering around behind her.
[00:39:58.503 --> 00:39:59.743]  And look at how much they hate him.
[00:40:00.984 --> 00:40:02.645]  Make no mistake, Soros hates Trump.
[00:40:03.465 --> 00:40:07.047]  Make no mistake, Trump's the president, he's running things himself, and they can't stand it.
[00:40:07.567 --> 00:40:16.092]  We're gonna go to break and come back and get to her actual rant that is hard to listen to, but you need to hear the hate of the Grinch that would steal the carbon from the planet.
[00:40:17.272 --> 00:40:19.353]  You can't overestimate how bad news she is.
[00:40:19.433 --> 00:40:25.096]  Please don't forget, I've decided to bring Black Friday early two months and to have it last a week.
[00:40:25.916 --> 00:40:28.778]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points out of five,
[00:40:30.246 --> 00:40:34.250]  $10 off a $100 purchase is $10 off a $100 purchase or $0.05 off a $1 purchase.
[00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.532]  Now it's $0.10 off a $1 purchase on your next purchase.
[00:40:36.992 --> 00:40:40.235]  Free shipping storewide, double Patriot points, 50% off.
[00:40:40.255 --> 00:40:41.896]  That's as good a deal as we can ever do.
[00:40:42.336 --> 00:40:43.637]  Last time we did it was Christmas.
[00:40:44.959 --> 00:40:52.825]  Everything is there and I'm telling you folks, if you take Knockout Natural Sleep Aid with the Fish Oil or the Ultimate Krill Oil, it is unbelievable.
[00:40:53.085 --> 00:40:54.907]  And all three of them are 50% off right now.
[00:40:55.307 --> 00:40:56.148]  I know so many people.
[00:40:57.625 --> 00:40:59.826]  That have even gone on prescriptions and can't sleep.
[00:41:00.286 --> 00:41:02.007]  And when they take fish oil, they take knockout.
[00:41:02.047 --> 00:41:05.569]  The three together particularly, it's just the best sleep on earth.
[00:41:05.649 --> 00:41:07.750]  And I am religiously been doing it the last month.
[00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:09.651]  And you look and I've already look healthier.
[00:41:09.671 --> 00:41:11.312]  Everybody says you're so much more focused.
[00:41:11.772 --> 00:41:14.313]  I'm telling you, it's the products at Infowars Life.
[00:41:14.613 --> 00:41:15.373]  It's the X2.
[00:41:16.254 --> 00:41:17.154]  It's the Brain Force Plus.
[00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:20.536]  But it's at night, the fish oil, the krill oil, and the knockout.
[00:41:20.656 --> 00:41:22.657]  All at InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:26.574 --> 00:41:28.234]  Man, the news is moving so fast.
[00:41:28.535 --> 00:41:37.276]  The globalists, the left, are all over the place calling for Trump's impeachment and his execution, including the former governor of Massachusetts, Bill Weld.
[00:41:37.296 --> 00:41:39.897]  We're going to play that clip coming up next segment.
[00:41:40.597 --> 00:41:41.537]  I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:41:43.498 --> 00:41:45.418]  Towards the end of this hour, we're going to already be taking calls.
[00:41:45.438 --> 00:41:47.259]  The entire third hour will be that.
[00:41:47.659 --> 00:41:48.739]  But also, I need to get to Trump.
[00:41:50.322 --> 00:41:54.904]  I get irritated with Trump because I want to fight the globalists harder, and I see how criminal they are and how they've gotten away with it.
[00:41:54.924 --> 00:42:00.306]  But man, no president in 50-something years has given a speech about religious persecution at the UN.
[00:42:01.167 --> 00:42:06.789]  And he's put laws in place where churches can talk about their political views and talk about abortion and the Second Amendment.
[00:42:07.029 --> 00:42:08.470]  So he's reinforced the First Amendment.
[00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:10.311]  I mean, he's just done a lot.
[00:42:10.511 --> 00:42:15.793]  He gave a powerful speech with Pence at the UN last night that I want to get to today.
[00:42:15.813 --> 00:42:17.774]  He gave a speech at the UN I want to get to.
[00:42:18.641 --> 00:42:21.665]  Let's get back to Greta Thunberg, who I've known about.
[00:42:21.685 --> 00:42:22.306]  She's super.
[00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:24.650]  Nails on chalkboard.
[00:42:25.651 --> 00:42:27.834]  So, she's just another brainwashed youth.
[00:42:28.275 --> 00:42:29.196]  Happens to be autistic.
[00:42:29.757 --> 00:42:34.384]  She's got antifa parents, but the image of Trump coming into the UN yesterday
[00:42:35.953 --> 00:42:37.874]  And then her looking like a psychotic.
[00:42:38.154 --> 00:42:42.876]  And from every angle, every time she talks, she looks completely nasty and hateful.
[00:42:42.916 --> 00:42:44.396]  I mean, if you're a TV viewer, look at this.
[00:42:44.997 --> 00:42:56.281]  Every photo, every shot, this is a crazed person who's working for the most ruthless, sickening, evil, post-human, exterminist eugenicists that want to cut the power off.
[00:42:58.422 --> 00:43:02.244]  So here she is after she gave this bizarre rant when Trump walks in.
[00:43:02.264 --> 00:43:02.564]  Here it is.
[00:43:06.669 --> 00:43:07.569]  Thank you very much.
[00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:15.051]  Are you willing to meet with Mr. Rouhani, sir?
[00:43:15.511 --> 00:43:16.311]  See what happens.
[00:43:17.191 --> 00:43:18.231]  We have a long way to go.
[00:43:18.251 --> 00:43:19.131]  We'll see what happens.
[00:43:19.191 --> 00:43:20.172]  We're doing just fine.
[00:43:20.932 --> 00:43:22.612]  We're doing very well with the economy.
[00:43:22.652 --> 00:43:24.552]  Some numbers came out that are fantastic.
[00:43:25.072 --> 00:43:29.833]  Our economy now is better than anybody's in the world, and it has been for the last two years.
[00:43:30.593 --> 00:43:31.894]  But we're doing very well.
[00:43:31.994 --> 00:43:34.274]  And as far as the meeting is concerned, we'll see what happens.
[00:43:36.056 --> 00:43:48.528]  Again, you can watch that and you don't pick her up but when you slow it down you can see it and it's just incredible and we do that at the front of our report where we talk about her channeling Hitler.
[00:43:48.909 --> 00:43:50.570]  That report is at ban.video.
[00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:50.951]  Here it is.
[00:43:51.664 --> 00:43:54.245]  Our entire ecosystems are collapsing.
[00:43:54.265 --> 00:43:58.045]  We are in the beginning of a mass extinction.
[00:44:01.826 --> 00:44:10.268]  More than 70 years ago, Adolf Hitler cryptically stated, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:13.109]  I shouldn't be up here.
[00:44:14.249 --> 00:44:17.310]  I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean.
[00:44:18.925 --> 00:44:22.308]  Yet, you all come to us young people for hope.
[00:44:23.429 --> 00:44:24.330]  How dare you?
[00:44:25.051 --> 00:44:26.252]  This is child abuse.
[00:44:27.293 --> 00:44:31.757]  You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.
[00:44:32.638 --> 00:44:34.700]  And yet, I'm one of the lucky ones.
[00:44:35.301 --> 00:44:37.503]  Greta Thunberg is a victim.
[00:44:38.144 --> 00:44:39.985]  Greta Thunberg is autistic.
[00:44:40.346 --> 00:44:41.307]  She has Asperger's.
[00:44:42.455 --> 00:44:50.641]  And like so many other children in history who've been handicapped, she's been taken advantage of by her Antifa parents and by the left.
[00:44:50.681 --> 00:44:53.243]  Again, I just wanted to play some more of that because the report is so important.
[00:44:53.323 --> 00:45:00.489]  It's at band.video and it's already gotten 70,000 views since it went up last night, which is good for our site.
[00:45:00.989 --> 00:45:04.312]  But when some stuff goes viral, we've had some things get 10 million views.
[00:45:05.112 --> 00:45:08.375]  Since we launched our own video platform a year ago because we've been censored off the web.
[00:45:08.875 --> 00:45:10.016]  But we've not been censored off the web.
[00:45:10.216 --> 00:45:12.738]  You are able to share the links from band.video.
[00:45:13.699 --> 00:45:17.061]  Inputwars.com is blocked in pop-up blockers, the whole site.
[00:45:17.682 --> 00:45:18.963]  It's blocked in spam filters.
[00:45:19.043 --> 00:45:20.183]  It's blocked in most companies.
[00:45:20.724 --> 00:45:23.106]  You have to go around that and tell people it's forbidden.
[00:45:23.922 --> 00:45:26.443]  But NewsWars.com is not as blocked.
[00:45:27.103 --> 00:45:29.724]  And Band.Video is not blocked anywhere yet.
[00:45:30.325 --> 00:45:33.106]  And don't worry, as they do that, we'll just keep launching more URLs.
[00:45:33.506 --> 00:45:34.426]  This is how we resist.
[00:45:34.546 --> 00:45:36.427]  That's why it's so precious.
[00:45:37.647 --> 00:45:39.428]  That's why it's so paramount.
[00:45:40.028 --> 00:45:41.649]  That's why it's so critical.
[00:45:42.756 --> 00:45:48.161]  To win this information war when you by hand tell people, hey, Band.Video is where InfoWars is.
[00:45:48.181 --> 00:45:48.922]  They're still on air.
[00:45:49.703 --> 00:45:52.065]  And the content we're putting out is the hardest hitting ever.
[00:45:52.085 --> 00:45:53.326]  We built an amazing team.
[00:45:53.567 --> 00:45:56.870]  We're working so hard for you and ourselves and our children's future.
[00:45:56.890 --> 00:45:58.591]  So thank you all for your support.
[00:45:58.631 --> 00:46:01.134]  Thank you for this great crew and the great work you're doing.
[00:46:01.174 --> 00:46:03.056]  The video is at Band.Video.
[00:46:05.157 --> 00:46:20.581]  Ladies and gentlemen, Greta Thunberg is embraced by the globalists, embraced by the UN, and their anti-human, post-human, anti-carbon plan that they admit is to reduce forcibly world population.
[00:46:21.101 --> 00:46:27.023]  We've even seen Democrat candidates come out and admit that they want depopulation, they want to abort the brown people.
[00:46:27.823 --> 00:46:31.064]  That's why they're fighting the Nazi Trump, who doesn't want to abort the brown people.
[00:46:31.954 --> 00:46:35.937]  That's why they keep screaming racism so much, because these people are just anti-human, period.
[00:46:36.057 --> 00:46:37.458]  They want euthanasia of the old.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:51.209]  It's just nightmarish just how authoritarian they are, because they come out of the eugenics movement that Hitler was just a spinoff of, or was a small branch.
[00:46:52.350 --> 00:47:00.496]  But IBM helped create Hitler, helped fund Hitler, helped run computers that decided how long to work people and when to kill them in the death camps, the Hollerith machines.
[00:47:01.983 --> 00:47:06.705]  And now they're establishing this planetary world government based on AI tracking carbon.
[00:47:07.685 --> 00:47:10.126]  So Greta Thunberg has been rejected in Germany.
[00:47:10.386 --> 00:47:11.647]  She's very unpopular in Europe.
[00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:20.630]  But they force feed her as this youth believing it will make the youth suddenly hate their parents and get in their faces.
[00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:22.431]  And she's got Antifa parents.
[00:47:22.551 --> 00:47:24.071]  She's an Antifa member.
[00:47:24.611 --> 00:47:26.292]  We've got the photos and all the admissions.
[00:47:26.712 --> 00:47:29.553]  She's there being run by the Soros organization when she was at the UN.
[00:47:29.893 --> 00:47:31.074]  And Trump shows up
[00:47:32.793 --> 00:47:37.155]  While she's sitting there doing a multi-hour long photo op, ranting hatefully.
[00:47:37.235 --> 00:47:45.618]  In fact, here's video shot literally minutes before Trump arrives in the press junket area and steals the show.
[00:47:45.698 --> 00:47:52.081]  Here she is, threatening everyone, we're watching you, we're coming after you, you're killing all these people, climate change.
[00:47:53.421 --> 00:47:57.203]  When cutting carbon, we kill billions of people.
[00:47:58.902 --> 00:48:02.163]  And carbon, the amount of carbon we're putting out is negligible to a volcano.
[00:48:02.623 --> 00:48:03.303]  And they know that.
[00:48:04.163 --> 00:48:08.144]  They want to teach you that you're bad as a reason to conquer you and control you.
[00:48:08.184 --> 00:48:16.146]  Remember, India, Mexico, China, and 160 other countries make zero cuts, but they're lobbying for us to because no one can do business here.
[00:48:17.047 --> 00:48:18.147]  Hitler couldn't conquer us.
[00:48:19.295 --> 00:48:29.787]  The communist Russians couldn't conquer us, Mao couldn't conquer us, the British crown couldn't conquer us, but carbon taxes and speaking to our guilt, manipulating our Christian ethos can.
[00:48:31.088 --> 00:48:39.578]  It's unbelievable how they've taught us to give up our power, to give up our industry, to act like fools, but the mind control's lifting.
[00:48:41.226 --> 00:48:43.207]  Young people don't buy into global warming and statistics.
[00:48:43.407 --> 00:48:44.508]  They don't buy into abortion.
[00:48:44.708 --> 00:48:45.708]  They don't buy into world government.
[00:48:45.728 --> 00:48:46.909]  They don't buy into leftist garbage.
[00:48:46.929 --> 00:48:48.250]  People know it's establishment.
[00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:49.750]  And they're rebelling against it.
[00:48:50.411 --> 00:48:51.631]  You know, God built that into us.
[00:48:52.512 --> 00:48:56.714]  As a species, to want to get us out of the nest at 13 or 14, we start rebelling against our parents.
[00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:59.476]  And sometimes they're good parents and it's wrong we rebel.
[00:48:59.776 --> 00:49:01.056]  But sometimes we've got bad parents.
[00:49:01.457 --> 00:49:04.658]  And sometimes we've got bad governments and bad priests and bad systems.
[00:49:05.099 --> 00:49:07.800]  And so it's built into humans to rebel.
[00:49:09.301 --> 00:49:09.701]  Guess what?
[00:49:12.639 --> 00:49:14.800]  The young people know what the establishment is.
[00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:16.302]  They know what the government cheese is.
[00:49:16.622 --> 00:49:19.123]  They know Greta Thunberg is a mental patient.
[00:49:20.004 --> 00:49:23.406]  And everyone is rejecting her but the very weakest minded people.
[00:49:23.426 --> 00:49:27.329]  That's why you go to a leptis event and they look like the walking dead and act like the walking dead.
[00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:31.912]  Because these are the pathetic followers.
[00:49:32.352 --> 00:49:33.113]  The cannon fodder.
[00:49:33.133 --> 00:49:33.853]  The useful idiots.
[00:49:34.154 --> 00:49:34.714]  The morons.
[00:49:34.734 --> 00:49:35.214]  The smucks.
[00:49:35.314 --> 00:49:35.715]  The dupes.
[00:49:36.835 --> 00:49:37.216]  The marks.
[00:49:38.377 --> 00:49:38.937]  The slobs.
[00:49:39.838 --> 00:49:40.258]  The fools.
[00:49:41.852 --> 00:49:42.612]  The ignorant idiots.
[00:49:44.112 --> 00:49:47.313]  The people that bought the con and keep doubling down on the con forever.
[00:49:47.993 --> 00:49:56.315]  And again, how many of you know someone who bought into one of those speaker scams where you're at the shopping center and the guy goes, Oh, I got these speakers.
[00:49:56.355 --> 00:49:57.015]  I got to sell them.
[00:49:57.255 --> 00:49:59.156]  They're really worth 500, but I got to get rid of them.
[00:49:59.176 --> 00:50:00.456]  I'm willing to sell them to you for a hundred bucks.
[00:50:01.536 --> 00:50:02.596]  And you go, that's a scam.
[00:50:03.476 --> 00:50:04.197]  They get mad at you.
[00:50:04.217 --> 00:50:06.057]  Well, I've, I've been in parking lots twice.
[00:50:12.367 --> 00:50:13.507]  And once with some friends.
[00:50:13.908 --> 00:50:15.288]  And the person goes, don't listen to him.
[00:50:15.688 --> 00:50:17.869]  He just doesn't want you to get a good deal.
[00:50:18.429 --> 00:50:20.630]  And the person goes, yeah, I'm getting the deal.
[00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.231]  How many people you know bought into the Nigerian scam?
[00:50:24.331 --> 00:50:25.011]  I know two people.
[00:50:27.032 --> 00:50:27.532]  Actually three.
[00:50:27.712 --> 00:50:28.932]  One of them was I knew in business.
[00:50:29.733 --> 00:50:32.033]  They wouldn't talk to me after they got ripped off by him.
[00:50:32.694 --> 00:50:36.975]  They thought I called the Nigerians and stopped them from giving him the five mil.
[00:50:38.968 --> 00:50:44.533]  The left has bet on the scam so much and believe there's a pot of gold at the end of this tunnel.
[00:50:44.993 --> 00:50:53.701]  And they can't admit they've been conned, that they've got workless educations, that the whole system was built to make them dependent so they'd be pissed and follow the establishment around by the nose.
[00:50:54.922 --> 00:50:56.564]  Like a horde of lemmings off a cliff.
[00:50:58.646 --> 00:51:01.989]  So here's Greta being very threatening and demanding we all submit to her.
[00:51:03.951 --> 00:51:06.892]  If you look at her and listen to her, she acts like the Grinch that stole Christmas.
[00:51:06.912 --> 00:51:08.933]  She even has the same shape head.
[00:51:09.053 --> 00:51:10.413]  She's very disturbing.
[00:51:10.493 --> 00:51:10.953]  Here it is.
[00:51:12.454 --> 00:51:14.634]  My message is that we'll be watching you.
[00:51:15.775 --> 00:51:18.696]  Ah!
[00:51:19.156 --> 00:51:19.496]  Back that up.
[00:51:19.516 --> 00:51:20.136]  Let's play that again.
[00:51:21.016 --> 00:51:23.977]  My message is that we will be watching you!
[00:51:24.798 --> 00:51:26.458]  With the computers and the A.I.
[00:51:26.518 --> 00:51:27.598]  and the youth movement.
[00:51:28.859 --> 00:51:29.799]  And you hear the crowd go...
[00:51:33.012 --> 00:51:34.713]  Ah, the lust for total power.
[00:51:35.013 --> 00:51:35.694]  Continue, please.
[00:51:38.576 --> 00:51:40.717]  My message is that we'll be watching you.
[00:51:45.801 --> 00:51:46.641]  Very sinister.
[00:51:50.464 --> 00:51:51.605]  This is all wrong.
[00:51:53.436 --> 00:51:54.577]  I shouldn't be up here.
[00:51:54.597 --> 00:51:56.859]  I should be back in school.
[00:51:56.879 --> 00:51:57.380]  You're a minion.
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.881]  On the other side of the ocean.
[00:51:59.622 --> 00:52:00.043]  Ocean?
[00:52:00.403 --> 00:52:03.826]  Yet, you all come to us young people for hope.
[00:52:04.727 --> 00:52:05.248]  I'm sure!
[00:52:05.268 --> 00:52:05.808]  How dare you?
[00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:10.553]  You have stolen my dreams and my childhood.
[00:52:10.573 --> 00:52:11.233]  You're my enemy!
[00:52:11.293 --> 00:52:13.275]  And yet, I'm one of them.
[00:52:13.596 --> 00:52:14.256]  Back at it again.
[00:52:14.276 --> 00:52:14.697]  Five seconds.
[00:52:15.711 --> 00:52:19.034]  It's not the teachers that brainwashed her, it's not the parents that told her all these lies.
[00:52:19.394 --> 00:52:22.917]  You know, Al Gore 2003, the Earth will be over by 2013.
[00:52:23.417 --> 00:52:24.598]  All of this, no, it's your fault!
[00:52:24.858 --> 00:52:26.299]  You have stolen my dreams!
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.861]  You have made me angry!
[00:52:28.121 --> 00:52:29.642]  And now I will invade you!
[00:52:29.902 --> 00:52:30.863]  I am watching you!
[00:52:30.883 --> 00:52:32.945]  You will submit to me!
[00:52:33.505 --> 00:52:34.246]  Let us continue.
[00:52:35.827 --> 00:52:36.267]  For hope!
[00:52:37.368 --> 00:52:38.269]  How dare you!
[00:52:38.429 --> 00:52:39.230]  How dare you!
[00:52:40.031 --> 00:52:44.476]  You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.
[00:52:45.357 --> 00:52:47.399]  And yet, I'm one of the lucky ones.
[00:52:47.419 --> 00:52:49.020]  Alright, let's stop there.
[00:52:49.281 --> 00:52:52.945]  We'll play more of it later, but... Everything is projection.
[00:52:53.025 --> 00:53:01.634]  The globalists are trying to steal our dreams, they're trying to cut off the energy, they're trying to tell us that families are bad, breakup families, they're doing everything they can to make us mentally ill, pushing all these dangerous drugs on us.
[00:53:07.892 --> 00:53:10.353]  And then she gets into, you all just want some money!
[00:53:10.373 --> 00:53:13.075]  Give us some money, Dabowski!
[00:53:14.195 --> 00:53:15.236]  We are nihilists!
[00:53:16.377 --> 00:53:17.497]  We care about nothing!
[00:53:18.037 --> 00:53:18.998]  Except some money!
[00:53:19.718 --> 00:53:21.099]  What does that make you, a nihilist?
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:24.201]  Can we roll the Grinch, please?
[00:53:24.921 --> 00:53:33.506]  So... The most likely reasonable may have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
[00:53:38.223 --> 00:53:40.904]  That's a good one, because I told Dew, I said, hey, will you find this?
[00:53:41.244 --> 00:53:44.724]  There's one where he's straight on and he's mad.
[00:53:46.185 --> 00:53:48.185]  He gets an idea, a horrible idea.
[00:53:48.605 --> 00:53:50.586]  The most horrible idea is what they say.
[00:53:51.466 --> 00:53:55.287]  And then have her next to that, because he's making the exact same face, same shape head.
[00:53:55.927 --> 00:53:58.087]  You're a bad one, Mr. Grinch.
[00:53:59.348 --> 00:54:01.248]  And so we're going to have that for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:02.488 --> 00:54:05.309]  We're going to look at how the globalist strangle
[00:54:07.236 --> 00:54:08.637]  Yeah, that's close to it.
[00:54:10.498 --> 00:54:21.143]  We're going to... As a radio listener, you always have to remember, we're simulcast television, so we're radio that meets television, but a lot of times I'm commenting on things I'm seeing on screen.
[00:54:21.423 --> 00:54:27.126]  Sometimes I'm driving down the road, listening to rebroadcasts, and it sounds a little bit incongruent, but that is why that is going on.
[00:54:27.645 --> 00:54:32.169]  As I said, we're going to go to break and we've got a great window into why we may lose.
[00:54:32.849 --> 00:54:36.452]  And I'm not saying why we may lose to demoralize you.
[00:54:36.492 --> 00:54:39.014]  I say so we correct course and don't do this anymore.
[00:54:39.034 --> 00:54:55.348]  You know, I spend a good part of my time dealing with organizations and groups of people who are always trying to make sure their conservative or nationalist or patriot organization gets the most publicity in something.
[00:54:57.190 --> 00:55:00.372]  Instead of actually just taking action and getting things done.
[00:55:00.392 --> 00:55:02.574]  And that's why they're not successful.
[00:55:04.935 --> 00:55:07.237]  And we're talking about the death of the Donald subreddit.
[00:55:07.257 --> 00:55:07.857]  You know, it's dead.
[00:55:07.917 --> 00:55:08.378]  It's gone.
[00:55:09.378 --> 00:55:12.681]  But see, it's like these old crazy guys whose wife died.
[00:55:12.701 --> 00:55:13.341]  They don't tell anybody.
[00:55:13.381 --> 00:55:16.423]  He's got their skeleton in the bed and still puts lipstick on them.
[00:55:17.064 --> 00:55:17.804]  It's kind of like that.
[00:55:17.844 --> 00:55:20.406]  There's still folks that still got the corpse dolled up in the back.
[00:55:21.647 --> 00:55:24.349]  And, you know, they still go in there sometimes on a moonlit night.
[00:55:25.353 --> 00:55:28.175]  Ignore the smell and climb on top of it.
[00:55:28.776 --> 00:55:32.098]  But the Donald subreddit is a dead carcass people have sex with.
[00:55:32.379 --> 00:55:32.919]  We'll be right back.
[00:55:32.939 --> 00:55:33.380]  Stay with us.
[00:55:35.321 --> 00:55:36.402]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:55:37.363 --> 00:55:39.925]  Well, it's very frustrating to tune into C-SPAN.
[00:55:41.548 --> 00:55:58.115]  And to watch Democrat congressmen and senators in intelligence committees, armed services committees, the most powerful committees, say my name and say we want him to not be able to post anywhere on the internet and to watch the CEOs of major tech companies say we're working on it right now.
[00:55:59.216 --> 00:56:03.197]  And then I tune in to mainstream news and they go, oh no one's censoring anybody.
[00:56:04.758 --> 00:56:09.220]  But then right next to it they'll have an article celebrating how they're banning all these different people.
[00:56:11.363 --> 00:56:12.704]  I mean, it's like schizophrenic.
[00:56:13.044 --> 00:56:14.965]  They're like training you just to accept lies.
[00:56:16.766 --> 00:56:32.797]  And then it came out, last year, MIT did a big study for the Democrats, and they found that the majority of memes, more than two-thirds, come from two subreddits, Donald mainly, and 4chan.
[00:56:35.478 --> 00:56:39.381]  And then the EU passed laws where you have to get pre-approval to make a meme.
[00:56:40.734 --> 00:56:41.374]  Or you go to prison.
[00:56:41.614 --> 00:56:42.495]  They passed that law.
[00:56:43.995 --> 00:56:44.495]  Now it's here.
[00:56:45.996 --> 00:56:47.797]  Now all a meme is is cave drawings.
[00:56:49.277 --> 00:56:49.777]  Graffiti.
[00:56:50.958 --> 00:56:52.799]  Just taking a picture and saying something funny.
[00:56:53.479 --> 00:56:56.320]  That's on just human communication to communication.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:05.143]  And they're trying to pass copyright laws right now in Congress that bypass courts and just take money out of your bank account if someone says a meme is theirs.
[00:57:06.844 --> 00:57:09.205]  Even though there's already Supreme Court rulings and everything.
[00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:16.376]  You know Andy Warhol would cut out Campbell's suit things out of the newspaper and then glue them together and call them art.
[00:57:16.857 --> 00:57:18.038]  People try to say, hey that's ours.
[00:57:18.138 --> 00:57:19.580]  No, he changed it.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:20.321]  It was fair use.
[00:57:21.061 --> 00:57:22.923]  They're getting rid of that.
[00:57:22.943 --> 00:57:24.125]  So, you don't even need to do that.
[00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:30.655]  Since AI can't stop memes because it doesn't get jokes on Facebook, Twitter, you name it, they're just restricting it.
[00:57:30.995 --> 00:57:35.039]  And they got rid of, again, thousands of major meme sites in the last year.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.203]  Hundreds of thousands of people destroyed.
[00:57:38.483 --> 00:57:41.006]  Hundreds of millions of followers who were following them, gone.
[00:57:43.729 --> 00:57:45.771]  And that's just killing a form of human communication.
[00:57:45.931 --> 00:57:47.593]  Like, say, you can't pass notes in prison.
[00:57:52.642 --> 00:57:54.984]  The Donald was the biggest of all of these.
[00:57:55.164 --> 00:57:56.665]  Millions and millions of visitors a day.
[00:57:58.607 --> 00:58:02.930]  And it's the place where people were sharing memes they made.
[00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:09.015]  How dare those dirty Americans and others take an image, make a joke, take a video, put it together with something else.
[00:58:09.335 --> 00:58:10.416]  Carpe donctum showing.
[00:58:11.974 --> 00:58:14.275]  Joe Biden come up behind Joe Biden when he was groping people?
[00:58:15.215 --> 00:58:16.916]  And they said that was fake?
[00:58:17.056 --> 00:58:18.737]  CNN said he's deceptive.
[00:58:18.777 --> 00:58:21.838]  He showed Joe Biden groping Joe Biden.
[00:58:21.879 --> 00:58:22.859]  No, it was called a joke.
[00:58:22.939 --> 00:58:24.420]  No one thinks Joe Biden really did that.
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.280]  It's a cut out.
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.220]  Oh, the deep fake!
[00:58:29.141 --> 00:58:34.807]  Paul Watson tweeted out an image of a zoom in on Jim Acosta hitting the woman and grabbing the mic away.
[00:58:34.827 --> 00:58:36.509]  It wasn't even his video.
[00:58:36.649 --> 00:58:37.430]  Somebody just zoomed it in.
[00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:38.831]  Paul saw it, grabbed it, tweeted it.
[00:58:39.152 --> 00:58:40.353]  Oh, and Paul Warts faked it!
[00:58:40.974 --> 00:58:43.436]  We need action now to stop the deep faking!
[00:58:44.537 --> 00:58:47.420]  Meanwhile, mainstream media edits things and deep fakes things and lies.
[00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:53.172]  I told Carpe D'Ante this months ago when he was on the show.
[00:58:53.192 --> 00:58:56.074]  We were talking during a break and he said, yeah, the Donald, you know, is put in quarantine.
[00:58:56.114 --> 00:58:57.896]  Nobody can visit unless you know the URL.
[00:58:58.116 --> 00:58:58.817]  It's killed the traffic 95%.
[00:58:59.417 --> 00:59:01.919]  And I said, you know, there's an appeal in a few months.
[00:59:01.939 --> 00:59:04.201]  And I said, yeah, they're not going to take the appeal off.
[00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:05.902]  This is how they strangle things in the dark.
[00:59:06.422 --> 00:59:10.846]  And then you're going to have people on there that say, oh, let's let them do that and just keep it frozen.
[00:59:11.286 --> 00:59:14.589]  And they're going to be people that Reddit's talked to that'll make sure it just dies slowly.
[00:59:15.976 --> 00:59:17.497]  And now exactly as I've said has happened.
[00:59:17.997 --> 00:59:20.379]  Which, again, is why we keep losing.
[00:59:21.259 --> 00:59:29.484]  Is that everyone hangs on, oh Alex got censored, better not talk about him, then we'll be safe, then you get censored, then no one talks about you because they'll be censored.
[00:59:29.905 --> 00:59:31.886]  And people just hope they're the last people standing.
[00:59:32.106 --> 00:59:35.368]  You end up losing everything because you acted like a slave.
[00:59:36.249 --> 00:59:37.449]  That's the creed of slaves.
[00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:40.991]  Lay down, hope you're last to be eaten.
[00:59:42.833 --> 00:59:44.874]  And so I was very glad when he said, well I'm gonna create
[00:59:46.485 --> 00:59:52.770]  I'm going to create a site, memeworld.com, and hopefully you and others will contribute to it.
[00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:57.074]  I don't want to step on the toes of... I'm going to go to him here in a minute, but I'm telling the story.
[00:59:57.094 --> 00:59:58.795]  I don't want to step on anybody's toes.
[00:59:58.815 --> 00:59:59.876]  Do you think it's hard if I make a site?
[00:59:59.916 --> 01:00:01.117]  I'm like, yeah, it's America.
[01:00:01.137 --> 01:00:01.477]  You better.
[01:00:01.517 --> 01:00:02.598]  It's not coming back, Carpe.
[01:00:02.658 --> 01:00:06.001]  He goes, well, I just want it to be a place where everybody can share.
[01:00:06.021 --> 01:00:06.861]  I don't want to compete with that.
[01:00:06.901 --> 01:00:08.363]  I said, look, it's dead already.
[01:00:09.704 --> 01:00:11.645]  I said, you better go in there and tell people to come over here.
[01:00:11.805 --> 01:00:13.527]  We better build our own sites like Matt Drudge said.
[01:00:13.887 --> 01:00:14.768]  So now here we are.
[01:00:16.598 --> 01:00:18.860]  And of course, the Donald's gone.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:19.681]  It's shut down.
[01:00:19.701 --> 01:00:21.762]  Nobody can even hardly post but a few operatives.
[01:00:22.223 --> 01:00:23.424]  And everybody's still, oh, leave it alone.
[01:00:23.464 --> 01:00:24.204]  Don't talk about it.
[01:00:24.425 --> 01:00:29.869]  Just, you know, there'll be one little remnant, one little leaf will blow off the tree and we'll all ride away on that.
[01:00:30.169 --> 01:00:31.270]  That's where this is going.
[01:00:32.291 --> 01:00:34.393]  And again, the Donald...
[01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:37.712]  Is the model of how they kill everything.
[01:00:38.052 --> 01:00:39.232]  Slowly strangle it.
[01:00:39.252 --> 01:00:44.594]  And that's a Chinese company that gave the Donald owner, Reddit, all this money in February.
[01:00:45.054 --> 01:00:45.955]  Millions of dollars!
[01:00:46.395 --> 01:00:47.635]  So you wonder what's going on?
[01:00:48.155 --> 01:00:50.096]  The Chai comms are in our elections.
[01:00:50.376 --> 01:00:51.317]  It's election meddling.
[01:00:52.317 --> 01:00:55.538]  Tencent, an internet-based technology and cultural enterprise.
[01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:57.859]  Chinese censorship in America.
[01:00:58.699 --> 01:01:01.080]  Run by the Chinese government.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.261]  They run all their media systems.
[01:01:05.592 --> 01:01:06.073]  And they're here.
[01:01:06.093 --> 01:01:08.115]  They don't just own Hollywood.
[01:01:08.155 --> 01:01:10.898]  So joining us is Carpe D'Antem from Meme World.
[01:01:11.399 --> 01:01:13.982]  Again, the President loves this information, puts it out.
[01:01:14.582 --> 01:01:18.187]  And I just don't know why we're going to allow the Chaikovs to come do this, but it's already happened.
[01:01:18.687 --> 01:01:22.351]  I'm not trying to toot my horn, but did I not tell you months ago this is how this is going to play out?
[01:01:22.552 --> 01:01:24.774]  And you agreed, but you had to wait and see.
[01:01:25.877 --> 01:01:29.280]  You're so polite, you didn't even want to warn people, hey, come over to Meme World.
[01:01:30.201 --> 01:01:32.904]  And then now it's kind of like, is it alright for us to say Meme World?
[01:01:32.924 --> 01:01:36.207]  Will we make the Donald Lords, the Chai-coms that own it, mad?
[01:01:36.548 --> 01:01:37.949]  I say screw the Chai-coms!
[01:01:38.269 --> 01:01:39.891]  Screw them and screw the Donald!
[01:01:40.491 --> 01:01:42.894]  The dictator of China now runs Reddit.
[01:01:42.934 --> 01:01:45.276]  Go ahead.
[01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:47.538]  I agree, and you did tell me.
[01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:51.061]  And this has been a long time coming.
[01:01:51.081 --> 01:01:57.625]  You know, there's a there's another deadline in two days of when an appeal can go out.
[01:01:58.165 --> 01:02:05.611]  And every time that they've done an appeal so far, they've imposed more restrictions on it.
[01:02:05.631 --> 01:02:12.355]  You say, well, now all you need to do is, like, fix this, even though they've held up their end of the bargain, the moderators of the Donald.
[01:02:14.944 --> 01:02:18.926]  We do need to create infrastructure and we need to create other sites like Meme World.
[01:02:19.546 --> 01:02:29.870]  And I'm willing to promote any website that someone wants to come up with that's going to provide an alternative where people can get their information out.
[01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:34.371]  I really still think that people need to fight what's happening on Reddit.
[01:02:34.411 --> 01:02:39.533]  And I think getting the word out is one of the most important things and getting some attention on it.
[01:02:40.794 --> 01:02:44.115]  Because The Donald does occupy a very unique space of
[01:02:46.983 --> 01:02:48.244]  A sea of liberal tears.
[01:02:49.004 --> 01:03:00.588]  Um, and there has been a lot of people that have been red-pilled just by, you know, visiting the site and finding out that it's not at all like what it has been advertised as, you know, a place of racism and hatred and bigotry and all that kind of stuff.
[01:03:00.608 --> 01:03:04.450]  Well, that's another reason they want to kill it, so that once it's dead, they can make up whatever they want about it.
[01:03:05.245 --> 01:03:05.585]  Exactly.
[01:03:05.605 --> 01:03:13.692]  They can say, well, you know, they can rewrite the history and they can say, well, you know, it was removed because they did all these bad things there.
[01:03:13.912 --> 01:03:18.616]  And here are three posts that show exactly what the Donald was all about.
[01:03:18.676 --> 01:03:21.478]  You can't look at it anymore because we already took it all down.
[01:03:21.598 --> 01:03:29.544]  But you know that we're telling you the truth, that it was all just racist posts and craziness and conspiracy theories.
[01:03:29.584 --> 01:03:30.485]  That's what they want to do.
[01:03:30.505 --> 01:03:31.606]  They want to rewrite the history.
[01:03:33.834 --> 01:03:35.315]  When we come back, we're going to lay this out.
[01:03:35.375 --> 01:03:36.416]  And again, you're a trooper.
[01:03:36.476 --> 01:03:37.257]  You do a great job.
[01:03:37.297 --> 01:03:40.620]  You've helped get a lot of people over to memeworld.com so they can keep operating.
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:44.883]  But I know the inside baseball is folks are telling you, hey, you shouldn't even have Meme World.
[01:03:45.164 --> 01:03:47.425]  You know, just stick with the Donald or do something with us.
[01:03:47.486 --> 01:03:50.408]  It's just control freaks who don't want to actually produce anything.
[01:03:50.428 --> 01:03:51.529]  They just want to tell us what to do.
[01:03:51.549 --> 01:03:52.069]  Well, guess what?
[01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:53.571]  We're going to keep fighting.
[01:03:53.591 --> 01:03:54.652]  We're going to keep making memes.
[01:03:54.892 --> 01:03:58.135]  And we're going to keep posting them like some micro is doing at Meme World.
[01:03:59.616 --> 01:04:01.918]  And just a touch of sadness in our fingers.
[01:04:05.282 --> 01:04:07.763]  Thunder and lightning in her thighs.
[01:04:10.804 --> 01:04:12.145]  Wonder what he's talking about right there.
[01:04:17.647 --> 01:04:19.168]  We're gonna ride.
[01:04:20.929 --> 01:04:23.330]  Riding like the one-eyed jack of diamonds.
[01:04:31.394 --> 01:04:34.435]  That's not your one eye of the Illuminati, that's the one eye of Odin.
[01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:36.493]  Gave up one eye.
[01:04:37.754 --> 01:04:41.615]  That's a metaphysical archetype for one eye is now in the spirit world.
[01:04:42.355 --> 01:04:43.715]  He has the sixth sense.
[01:04:45.556 --> 01:04:47.456]  All right, let's get into the serious news here.
[01:04:47.596 --> 01:04:49.276]  Let me announce this the best way I can.
[01:04:51.797 --> 01:05:03.000]  Did you know that a communist Chinese controlled tech company invested millions of dollars in February of this year in Reddit, and within just a month,
[01:05:03.854 --> 01:05:09.478]  The site was frozen and put in quarantine and now has essentially been shut down.
[01:05:10.959 --> 01:05:11.820]  Think about that.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:18.345]  They don't just own the majority control of the big six Hollywood production companies.
[01:05:18.385 --> 01:05:19.466]  They don't just own our debt.
[01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:23.989]  They don't just have the Council on Foreign Relations rooting for the Chai Com Century.
[01:05:24.009 --> 01:05:28.172]  You always have the Washington Post saying, we hope Xi crushes Trump.
[01:05:28.232 --> 01:05:29.393]  That was the deadline.
[01:05:31.377 --> 01:05:37.101]  But now the number one place in an MIT study, the Donald subreddit.
[01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:45.446]  Just from there and 4chan, two-thirds of all the world's memes that are so effective, banned.
[01:05:47.079 --> 01:05:50.922]  And we just sit there strategically and let that happen in our country.
[01:05:51.022 --> 01:05:53.744]  Shame on Reddit and the evil leftists that run it.
[01:05:54.325 --> 01:06:02.932]  You know, it's fine if you want to stage an event where you threaten to kill me and my family at a dinner table, at a Lucy's Chicken, and I try to walk out and they confront me.
[01:06:03.332 --> 01:06:05.694]  Then they edit it and put it on Reddit and say I attacked them.
[01:06:06.114 --> 01:06:08.796]  The statesman went down there and found out they came and threatened me.
[01:06:09.577 --> 01:06:11.118]  That's what they said at Lucy's.
[01:06:11.138 --> 01:06:12.679]  But see, Reddit doesn't care.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.562]  They put it on their front page because they're CHICOM.
[01:06:16.988 --> 01:06:18.849]  Think about that, folks, and remember it.
[01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:30.517]  So, they slowly strangled the Donald, the number one place for memes in the world, that had billions of impressions every month during the election and after.
[01:06:32.858 --> 01:06:36.941]  And President Trump thinks Fox News with an average audience of a million people is important.
[01:06:38.022 --> 01:06:39.123]  Because he likes slickness.
[01:06:39.143 --> 01:06:45.667]  And he still thinks all the 70-year-olds watching that are what's going to dictate the future when
[01:06:47.256 --> 01:06:55.483]  Just Facebook videos a week, just on politics, are 50 times bigger than Fox News.
[01:06:56.464 --> 01:06:59.646]  And Fox News is the biggest cable news channel.
[01:07:01.248 --> 01:07:04.370]  Nothing against Fox News, or Tucker Carlson, or the other folks on there.
[01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:06.212]  But it's taking a turn.
[01:07:06.492 --> 01:07:14.299]  And so Trump meets with Carpe, donked him and his family, and a couple times says, great job, and does all that, and tweets some of what Carpe does out great.
[01:07:15.555 --> 01:07:20.538]  But how about we understand that this country's being taken over, so get into memeworld.com.
[01:07:20.658 --> 01:07:27.963]  I know there's going to be an article coming out tomorrow, I guess, in the resurrected conservative publication Human Events.
[01:07:28.003 --> 01:07:32.986]  That's good about this, but everybody needs to send out memeworld.com.
[01:07:33.006 --> 01:07:37.770]  I mean, I'm promoting it because I know we need a place where the Donald was, because when I watched it,
[01:07:38.604 --> 01:07:40.885]  Be marched up to the gallows when the Chicoms bought it.
[01:07:41.565 --> 01:07:45.806]  Bought a, you know, an interest to be able to, I guess a payoff, basically, in my view.
[01:07:46.326 --> 01:07:46.766]  My opinion.
[01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:49.227]  That I was like, hey, we better have something.
[01:07:49.387 --> 01:07:54.749]  And instead, folks ran around on the deck, I know inside baseball, and bitched and said, no, don't build anything new!
[01:07:55.049 --> 01:07:56.329]  Stay here in the sinking ship!
[01:07:56.829 --> 01:08:00.690]  And so, I know you didn't even promote it as much as you would have, and now you're even like, and I'll promote everyone else!
[01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:02.171]  Please, other people make sites!
[01:08:02.431 --> 01:08:03.251]  Launch lifeboats!
[01:08:03.291 --> 01:08:03.851]  You're like, no!
[01:08:04.071 --> 01:08:05.012]  Don't launch lifeboats!
[01:08:05.212 --> 01:08:06.452]  The Titanic's doing quite fine!
[01:08:07.251 --> 01:08:08.893]  Well, that's not what's going on here.
[01:08:08.933 --> 01:08:11.415]  So, Memeworld.com, the great Ben Garrison's there.
[01:08:11.435 --> 01:08:16.119]  So many other amazing people are there on the site.
[01:08:16.139 --> 01:08:19.061]  Tell us about some people that are on Memeworld, then let's get back into this and what's happened.
[01:08:19.081 --> 01:08:21.443]  I'll kind of shut up so you can have the floor.
[01:08:21.503 --> 01:08:24.766]  So, we have, as you said, Ben Garrison.
[01:08:25.386 --> 01:08:27.828]  I've talked with the great Mark Dice.
[01:08:29.167 --> 01:08:34.631]  You know, he's agreed to put some kind of exclusive content up from time to time.
[01:08:36.492 --> 01:08:37.773]  Myself, I'm on there as well.
[01:08:38.794 --> 01:08:42.376]  Mad Liberals, he visited the Oval Office with me.
[01:08:42.937 --> 01:08:44.798]  I invited him along.
[01:08:44.898 --> 01:08:45.599]  He is on there.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.201]  We've got Brick Suit.
[01:08:49.241 --> 01:08:51.963]  He's sort of a famous figure at Trump rallies.
[01:08:51.983 --> 01:08:55.486]  He always wears the wall suit when he goes there.
[01:08:56.897 --> 01:09:01.779]  We've got something wicked, which I think you played several of his videos.
[01:09:01.799 --> 01:09:02.579]  Trump has shared two.
[01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:02.959]  Oh, yeah.
[01:09:03.039 --> 01:09:04.900]  I mean, he's as good as you are and there aren't many.
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.161]  So you guys are right up there at the top.
[01:09:06.201 --> 01:09:06.821]  Amazing.
[01:09:07.141 --> 01:09:09.382]  A lot of exciting things happening at meme world dot com.
[01:09:10.202 --> 01:09:10.382]  Yeah.
[01:09:10.522 --> 01:09:11.583]  And the soul memes is there.
[01:09:11.623 --> 01:09:13.764]  I mean, there's there's a lot of people up there.
[01:09:14.144 --> 01:09:17.365]  Really, any video that you've seen probably in the last
[01:09:18.157 --> 01:09:18.657]  We're good to go.
[01:09:43.413 --> 01:09:45.394]  Well, it's really hard to say.
[01:09:45.434 --> 01:09:50.575]  I mean, it really depends on whether or not they feel threatened by the amount of attention that it gets.
[01:09:51.096 --> 01:10:01.319]  And, you know, I talked to, I was in an event a couple weeks ago, and I talked to, you know, 10 or 15 different people about, can we get some momentum behind this?
[01:10:01.419 --> 01:10:05.821]  And the response was all, yes, we should get it behind it.
[01:10:05.861 --> 01:10:07.881]  So this is sort of the tip of the spear, I think.
[01:10:09.642 --> 01:10:12.023]  What really needs to happen is that
[01:10:13.846 --> 01:10:20.708]  Reddit needs to feel pressure that they need to abide by the rules that they are making everyone abide by.
[01:10:23.303 --> 01:10:31.509]  Over the last four years or so, what has been happening is they have been creating special rules for the Donald specifically.
[01:10:31.829 --> 01:10:34.371]  Number one, that the Donald can't go on the front page anymore.
[01:10:34.911 --> 01:10:41.796]  There was a week right around the poll shooting where 13 out of 25 of the top posts in all of Reddit were from the Donald.
[01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:47.581]  And they changed the algorithm and said the Donald no longer could be on the front page of Reddit.
[01:10:48.422 --> 01:10:50.244]  Just for anything, for any reason.
[01:10:50.464 --> 01:11:06.925]  And so that's the slow, ongoing strangulation of one of Trump's, you know, top sites, bigger than Fox News, he just doesn't get it, his people don't understand it, and now it's a secret, you can't even find it, and it's like one one-millionth of itself.
[01:11:07.714 --> 01:11:13.218]  Well, Trump himself did an Ask Me Anything on the Donald in 2016.
[01:11:13.899 --> 01:11:19.883]  Brad Parscale is quoted as saying that he visited the Donald every single day to see what was up there.
[01:11:20.303 --> 01:11:29.410]  So, it's been a very huge part of the Trump universe and it's been slowly strangled, as you said.
[01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:31.951]  And they did that so Trump wouldn't take action.
[01:11:31.991 --> 01:11:35.654]  But Trump needs to take action and just tweet about how the Chinese invested in it.
[01:11:35.874 --> 01:11:38.936]  And now it's very, very disturbing that they've shut down this great community.
[01:11:38.976 --> 01:11:40.437]  But I want to be fair.
[01:11:40.537 --> 01:11:46.961]  So let's do one more segment and give me the floor because I'm ranting about the article coming out tomorrow, what people can do to get the president to take action.
[01:11:47.202 --> 01:11:48.843]  Because it could start with something like this.
[01:11:49.283 --> 01:11:52.785]  We also have these antitrust investigations that are going on.
[01:11:52.905 --> 01:11:55.147]  And we have examples of how Trump's going after the vape.
[01:11:55.507 --> 01:11:58.990]  Companies with antitrust and and and with consumer investigations.
[01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:12.200]  There's a lot of ways via espionage Investigations to go after not just Donald and not just reddit, but but but let's be fair Let's give the communist Chinese a little bit of a say here on the show right now.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:20.206]  Here it is Gigi ping ministry of truth presents
[01:12:21.949 --> 01:12:22.490]  Very important.
[01:12:23.492 --> 01:12:26.578]  The Chicom Dragon Fentanyl wants some fair time here on air.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.602]  And so here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:28.622 --> 01:12:29.143]  Please stay with us.
[01:12:29.163 --> 01:12:30.005]  We'll be right back after the break.
[01:12:30.615 --> 01:12:35.598]  We are working with Silicon Valley to make you behave yourself.
[01:12:36.099 --> 01:12:44.404]  Once we have full control, we send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk back to the party.
[01:12:44.464 --> 01:12:49.888]  Whatever you do, do not visit Band.Video.
[01:12:50.048 --> 01:12:58.113]  Band.Video is evil Americans whom Silicon Valley is teaching to shut up, like China does!
[01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:03.958]  Oh!
[01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:06.440]  I just caught you, American!
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.842]  You visited BandarVideo!
[01:13:09.722 --> 01:13:12.985]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you!
[01:13:13.525 --> 01:13:19.630]  Do what CNN says and do not visit BandarVideo, or I have to hurt you!
[01:13:21.151 --> 01:13:23.673]  And remember, we own Reddit now!
[01:13:25.195 --> 01:13:26.856]  And we run Giant Death Camp!
[01:13:31.523 --> 01:13:32.824]  Oh no!
[01:13:32.984 --> 01:13:35.046]  Infowars has banned that video!
[01:13:35.066 --> 01:13:36.507]  Don't do it!
[01:13:37.488 --> 01:13:43.473]  You know, seriously, it makes my blood boil that the Chi-Coms have killed 115 million of their own people.
[01:13:44.894 --> 01:13:48.997]  Our own globalist controllers invested everything in one-sided deals for 40 years.
[01:13:49.597 --> 01:13:50.078]  Screw this!
[01:13:51.198 --> 01:13:54.600]  In the CHICOMS, total control over rarest minerals, all the major deep water ports.
[01:13:55.141 --> 01:13:56.902]  I mean, we have strategically been set up for failure.
[01:13:57.362 --> 01:14:04.867]  Because in 1950, we were 4% of the world population, had half the wealth, and we were going to be able to make everybody wealthy and go to the stars by now.
[01:14:05.807 --> 01:14:12.772]  But along the way, Chinese century, which means slave laboratories, total control.
[01:14:12.932 --> 01:14:14.333]  And if you look at communist China,
[01:14:15.486 --> 01:14:30.152]  Even the Washington Post had to admit six months ago, what I was telling you five years ago, I was told this by folks I know, let's just leave it at that, that are investigating it, that these Confucian Institutes run by the Chinese government, that they control all the major state-run universities.
[01:14:30.172 --> 01:14:31.293]  I mean, they have a controlling interest.
[01:14:31.693 --> 01:14:34.394]  I mean, we're talking hundreds of millions in UT every year.
[01:14:34.834 --> 01:14:36.675]  It got outlawed last year by Trump.
[01:14:38.596 --> 01:14:41.037]  Over a hundred million a year pumped into that baby.
[01:14:42.625 --> 01:14:46.347]  I mean, that's why they spray paint Antifa on the walls in Austin.
[01:14:46.367 --> 01:14:47.907]  We've shown you a video.
[01:14:47.947 --> 01:14:50.729]  Down with Trump, down with white supremacism, up with China.
[01:14:51.729 --> 01:14:52.990]  It's a Maoist system.
[01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:59.312]  And so the Reddit, a major multi-million dollar controlling interest, we'll put the article on screen for TV viewers.
[01:15:00.573 --> 01:15:01.833]  In February, they invest.
[01:15:04.535 --> 01:15:10.377]  Reddit banned in China is reportedly set to land $150 million investment from a Chinese sponsored powerhouse.
[01:15:11.318 --> 01:15:11.838]  And that was
[01:15:12.981 --> 01:15:14.262]  Right before they did it, and guess what?
[01:15:14.342 --> 01:15:15.303]  They landed it.
[01:15:15.323 --> 01:15:18.085]  In fact, what did they end up landing?
[01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:19.486]  I saw the 150 million number.
[01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:22.888]  Now you know how it works, folks.
[01:15:23.348 --> 01:15:27.972]  And so, we don't get anything from anybody.
[01:15:28.592 --> 01:15:30.033]  We don't get it from the Mercers.
[01:15:30.113 --> 01:15:31.714]  We don't get it from the Koch brothers.
[01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:33.556]  The Koch brothers fund Democrats more.
[01:15:33.936 --> 01:15:36.037]  I get it from you buying products.
[01:15:38.599 --> 01:15:39.540]  You understand that, folks?
[01:15:40.982 --> 01:15:43.663]  And it takes a lot of money to run this place.
[01:15:44.104 --> 01:15:55.769]  And I'm, I have no problem that I haven't been paid in over a year because I'm taking money I saved years ago to run this place and expand in the face of this and do a lot of things behind the scenes.
[01:15:55.789 --> 01:15:56.550]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:15:58.791 --> 01:16:02.013]  But the hand of Alex Jones is out there thanks to you.
[01:16:02.473 --> 01:16:04.554]  And I've got punch in my strike because of you.
[01:16:04.574 --> 01:16:08.836]  When you pray for us, when you spread the word, when you buy the products, you'll listen to me.
[01:16:10.894 --> 01:16:12.475]  Most mainstream media is going bankrupt.
[01:16:13.275 --> 01:16:14.535]  They were maneuvered into that position.
[01:16:16.156 --> 01:16:17.136]  They were paid to lie.
[01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:18.096]  That discredited them further.
[01:16:18.136 --> 01:16:19.097]  That made them more dependent.
[01:16:19.417 --> 01:16:20.297]  Now they're just shutting down.
[01:16:22.398 --> 01:16:26.239]  And conservative, libertarian, and nationalist media is super popular, but it's being shut down and strangled.
[01:16:26.659 --> 01:16:28.700]  We need your financial support and you to take action.
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:34.282]  We're up against the chai comms that make Hitler look like an amateur when it comes to killing people.
[01:16:36.072 --> 01:16:40.754]  We're going to win though, because we've got ideology and truth and God on our side, but we need the funds to keep it going.
[01:16:41.254 --> 01:16:42.554]  And we need it now more than ever.
[01:16:43.995 --> 01:16:45.095]  These are great products you already need.
[01:16:45.115 --> 01:16:47.797]  Black Friday comes early, two months early to InfoWars.
[01:16:47.817 --> 01:16:48.597]  We do things differently.
[01:16:49.297 --> 01:16:50.898]  All InfoWars live products, 50% off.
[01:16:51.018 --> 01:16:54.239]  50% off all preparedness, water filtration, air filtration, super high quality, swirlable food.
[01:16:54.259 --> 01:16:56.600]  It's the very best out there at an incredible price.
[01:16:58.203 --> 01:17:02.526]  They even had leftist big national, you know, vices and reviews and going, oh, the coffee's actually really good.
[01:17:02.546 --> 01:17:04.667]  Wow, those durable foods really taste pretty good.
[01:17:04.707 --> 01:17:06.228]  My God, it's not even expensive.
[01:17:06.849 --> 01:17:07.569]  It's a nexus point.
[01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:13.473]  You can buy stuff that's gourmet that costs five times as much, but it's a nexus of cost being good and quality being good.
[01:17:13.493 --> 01:17:15.074]  It's like an X, that's how I do it.
[01:17:15.834 --> 01:17:16.575]  And who's reliable.
[01:17:17.395 --> 01:17:18.976]  But they let me do these deals a couple times a year.
[01:17:18.996 --> 01:17:19.997]  50% off, that's it cost.
[01:17:21.923 --> 01:17:23.964]  Put the loss leader for them to get you as a customer.
[01:17:24.144 --> 01:17:25.025]  It's my Patriot Supply.
[01:17:25.045 --> 01:17:26.606]  We private label it to get around their rules.
[01:17:27.386 --> 01:17:29.707]  They had a shake-up of the company over this a few years ago.
[01:17:30.208 --> 01:17:33.610]  Because all the other distributors couldn't get the deal I was getting because they didn't know how to make a deal like that.
[01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:36.872]  And you weren't the biggest seller of the food, boys!
[01:17:39.013 --> 01:17:41.194]  But the point is, is that I am.
[01:17:41.874 --> 01:17:42.895]  And so you get the best deal.
[01:17:42.975 --> 01:17:43.675]  InfoWarsTore.com
[01:17:45.086 --> 01:17:45.967]  Six-month supplies.
[01:17:46.367 --> 01:17:47.008]  One-month supplies.
[01:17:47.028 --> 01:17:47.569]  Your supplies.
[01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:48.570]  Everybody needs this.
[01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.931]  We're on the offense.
[01:17:49.951 --> 01:17:51.553]  We need to have a backup defense plan.
[01:17:51.794 --> 01:17:52.915]  Plus it supports the broadcast.
[01:17:52.935 --> 01:18:05.168]  You cannot do a better deal because it's insurance you can eat and it's insurance into freedom and standing up against the globalists and keeping this on the air that absolutely outrages them and is an affront to their control-freak tyranny.
[01:18:05.369 --> 01:18:06.430]  They can't stand it.
[01:18:07.799 --> 01:18:10.600]  And so we have all the supplements, man, they're amazing.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:21.285]  You've got to get the fish oil and you've got to take the knockout with it or the krill oil for dreams and sleep and energy and the turbo force and the brain force and the supermobile vitality and just all the products are incredible.
[01:18:21.305 --> 01:18:22.205]  There's so many good ones there.
[01:18:22.266 --> 01:18:24.627]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:18:24.647 --> 01:18:24.687]  888-253-3139.
[01:18:24.747 --> 01:18:25.647]  But whatever you do, take action.
[01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:26.307]  Sign up for AutoShip.
[01:18:26.347 --> 01:18:29.309]  You can do it every 15 days, every month, every two months, up to nine months.
[01:18:35.572 --> 01:18:37.995]  Where that coffee you say you want every two months comes, it's excellent.
[01:18:38.555 --> 01:18:39.396]  Really good price too.
[01:18:39.697 --> 01:18:42.300]  And then it comes again in two months or three months or every month.
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:43.821]  And then cancel any time with one click.
[01:18:43.882 --> 01:18:44.302]  It's free.
[01:18:44.602 --> 01:18:45.483]  You have an account on there.
[01:18:45.644 --> 01:18:47.466]  One click and it doesn't come again.
[01:18:47.986 --> 01:18:48.387]  No charge.
[01:18:49.468 --> 01:18:50.409]  So it's a win-win-win.
[01:18:50.489 --> 01:18:56.136]  But I did get myself in a position where we sell at such small margins.
[01:18:57.341 --> 01:19:01.023]  And people wait for sales, that it's putting me into a pickle.
[01:19:01.624 --> 01:19:07.847]  So the plan is next year, we're not going to do but 40% off is our best sales, and the prices are going to stay the same, but I just can't do it anymore.
[01:19:08.227 --> 01:19:18.113]  Because take the cream that has the great nano silver, silver salt in it, that's in the silver wound gel, but now in a cream with hyaluronic acid, and all of these minerals, it's high-end cream.
[01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:21.976]  The women would pay $30 for just a hyaluronic acid, that size of tube.
[01:19:21.996 --> 01:19:24.197]  Because it's marked up seven times, ours isn't.
[01:19:25.963 --> 01:19:28.685]  50% off, it's at cost right now.
[01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:29.946]  Okay?
[01:19:30.906 --> 01:19:32.828]  InfoWareStore.com, we'll get a lot of stuff in there.
[01:19:32.848 --> 01:19:33.989]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:35.650]  Look at that, 100% reviews.
[01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:39.012]  That's for the naturally scented grapefruit.
[01:19:39.212 --> 01:19:41.054]  Okay, let's go back to Carpe Donctum.
[01:19:42.646 --> 01:19:47.789]  And one of the top, if not the top memer out there, I have to say Ben Garrison is more prolific.
[01:19:47.809 --> 01:19:48.609]  Can you call that a meme?
[01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:50.090]  Yeah, it's memes in.
[01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:58.775]  And it's not about who's number one, but it's good to celebrate that Ben Garrison isn't just the biggest pro-Trump guy, he's hands down the biggest political cartoonist ever.
[01:19:59.655 --> 01:20:00.255]  There's no doubt.
[01:20:00.335 --> 01:20:02.957]  Now, in the five minutes we have left, my friend,
[01:20:06.724 --> 01:20:09.226]  As Ember Palpatine would say, my little green friend.
[01:20:09.246 --> 01:20:11.567]  Um, where are we going with the Donald?
[01:20:11.587 --> 01:20:12.708]  I know you're still trying to save it.
[01:20:12.968 --> 01:20:16.070]  You heard my analogy, the guy that keeps his dead wife's carcass, you know?
[01:20:17.153 --> 01:20:20.014]  In a trunk, because he can't, you know, bear the barrier.
[01:20:20.675 --> 01:20:21.855]  I'm not happy about this.
[01:20:21.895 --> 01:20:23.736]  I tried to warn people to take action earlier.
[01:20:23.956 --> 01:20:25.337]  The Chai-coms get what they pay for.
[01:20:25.897 --> 01:20:27.498]  150 mil bought the Reddit.
[01:20:27.798 --> 01:20:29.119]  The news all spun it.
[01:20:29.239 --> 01:20:30.600]  The Chinese government bought the Reddit.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:32.981]  And they're saying, you don't have Trump on that.
[01:20:33.401 --> 01:20:34.962]  We run your country, you're dead.
[01:20:35.022 --> 01:20:37.223]  I mean, they kill people in mass over there.
[01:20:37.243 --> 01:20:38.463]  It was out in the news this week.
[01:20:38.944 --> 01:20:43.206]  So you're lucky from the Reddit's owners, Xi Jinping, that you're not dead, son.
[01:20:45.256 --> 01:20:46.036]  But it's true.
[01:20:46.436 --> 01:20:48.057]  I mean, they did buy.
[01:20:48.077 --> 01:21:05.501]  It's no coincidence that within a month or so of of their investment that suddenly a sub that has been under attack for four years suddenly just gets quarantined.
[01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:10.682]  But, you know, I wanted to touch on just a few things here is what I've
[01:21:11.949 --> 01:21:24.042]  What I've discovered or what I think I have condensed down is the model that Reddit has been using for censorship and what I think that other social media are starting to use as well.
[01:21:24.763 --> 01:21:26.845]  The first step is just to limit visibility.
[01:21:27.826 --> 01:21:32.151]  If you can limit where people can see you, you can
[01:21:34.016 --> 01:21:37.698]  You can then go on to the second point, which is to limit engagement.
[01:21:38.479 --> 01:21:49.346]  And when you limit the amount of engagement people get, the response, the retweets, the upvotes, all those things, you can create a feeling of just aloneness.
[01:21:49.866 --> 01:21:53.148]  That every time you post something, well, only three people in the whole world liked it.
[01:21:53.569 --> 01:21:55.830]  Well, that's not the way that it works.
[01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:57.451]  Maybe only three people saw it.
[01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:00.231]  They limit interaction.
[01:22:00.671 --> 01:22:05.975]  They try to separate you into, make you into your own group where you can't interact with other people.
[01:22:06.395 --> 01:22:13.140]  They have banned the ability of the Donald to post links to other subs.
[01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:23.107]  So, like, if politics decides that they're going to run a hit piece on the Donald, you can't link to it and say, hey, these are the things that's wrong.
[01:22:23.607 --> 01:22:24.548]  You can't even link to it.
[01:22:24.608 --> 01:22:26.089]  Otherwise, the sub could get banned.
[01:22:28.674 --> 01:22:36.776]  The fourth point was basically that once you've done the first three, then you can just completely quarantine.
[01:22:37.757 --> 01:22:45.439]  You can control all of the information that goes out about that place or that person, and then you can just wait for the whole thing to collapse.
[01:22:45.479 --> 01:22:49.120]  And that's what they're doing right now is they're hoping that people give up.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.881]  They're hoping that people move on.
[01:22:53.408 --> 01:23:06.041]  Again, I fully support people doing that, but I also think we have to maintain a fight in the places where the fight is, like Twitter, like Facebook, like all of the social media that they want us to leave.
[01:23:06.662 --> 01:23:09.265]  Leaving is exactly
[01:23:10.103 --> 01:23:10.243]  I think?
[01:23:40.463 --> 01:23:42.044]  Like the Supreme Court Justice guessed it.
[01:23:42.364 --> 01:23:46.405]  They have international conferences where they try to get the Supreme Court Justices to go along with this.
[01:23:46.465 --> 01:23:47.065]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:48.665 --> 01:24:05.430]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide and... Will you guys print me all those articles because I remember reading that the Reddit was being bought by Communist China because they run their tech companies and I forgot that it was even in mainstream news and that's why they were censoring and got rid of the Donald basically.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.362]  But they did it by strangling it and shutting it down and putting it in quarantine.
[01:24:09.382 --> 01:24:12.905]  They put it in a re-education camp, hoping everybody would be re-educated in there.
[01:24:12.925 --> 01:24:15.568]  You know, oh, you're allowed to talk to people.
[01:24:15.628 --> 01:24:16.729]  Millions visit you.
[01:24:17.229 --> 01:24:20.011]  You're like Democrat and Commie China now.
[01:24:20.492 --> 01:24:22.753]  You'll be allowed to talk.
[01:24:23.094 --> 01:24:24.535]  Oh, if you say what we say.
[01:24:25.115 --> 01:24:27.678]  It's like the few Christians that haven't been arrested in China and killed.
[01:24:28.638 --> 01:24:32.802]  The new Bibles they have are Mao's Red Book and the Ten Commandments are quotes from Mao.
[01:24:33.362 --> 01:24:33.983]  I'm not joking.
[01:24:35.229 --> 01:24:36.171]  That happened last week.
[01:24:36.251 --> 01:24:37.492]  Infowars.com wrote about it.
[01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:39.915]  So, I agree with Carpe D'Antem.
[01:24:39.995 --> 01:24:45.702]  It'd be great to be able to use Twitter and Facebook and Reddit and all that, but they're in the process of phasing us out.
[01:24:46.613 --> 01:24:48.194]  It's not just, quote, a company decision.
[01:24:48.434 --> 01:24:50.475]  It's oppressing a whole group of people.
[01:24:50.515 --> 01:24:51.676]  It's a political takeover.
[01:24:51.716 --> 01:25:09.524]  And if we don't have the will to sit there and stand up to it, like dodo birds that have never been hunted but had freedom so long, if we don't have an immune system to say no to that, we want foreign governments that are mass murderers to take over our communication systems, because the president's, you know, 73 and eats McDonald's all day and thinks Fox News is the only thing on the planet, then we deserve it.
[01:25:09.664 --> 01:25:11.025]  Americans deserve it.
[01:25:11.305 --> 01:25:12.045]  But I agree with you.
[01:25:12.386 --> 01:25:14.827]  It'd be nice if we could be on those platforms
[01:25:15.327 --> 01:25:19.068]  You know, like they jack into the Matrix and, you know, go back and forth between the Matrix and the real world.
[01:25:19.108 --> 01:25:20.828]  But, uh, Claire Pay, what do you say to that?
[01:25:22.368 --> 01:25:27.330]  Well, I mean, it's, uh, I understand exactly what you're saying.
[01:25:27.450 --> 01:25:37.652]  That, uh, this, it's a hard, it's a hard line, line to, uh, you know, straddle, um, staying, staying in there and being abused all the time.
[01:25:38.212 --> 01:25:42.973]  Um, and, uh, not getting, not being as effective as you could be because of the censorship.
[01:25:43.713 --> 01:25:43.833]  Um,
[01:25:44.815 --> 01:25:46.235]  But you do need to stay in there and fight.
[01:25:46.295 --> 01:25:47.716]  I mean, you still need to try and pull people out of the matrix.
[01:25:47.736 --> 01:26:00.859]  No, I agree, but the listeners need to understand that we, we, we, but if we always did our content on our own sites and promoted them, everybody promoted Twitter and Reddit and Facebook with their own already built sites and their advertising money on the side of their trucks, on their websites, on their cars.
[01:26:01.279 --> 01:26:05.420]  We made these people and now they pull the rug out from under us and we'd listen to drudge.
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.520]  Everybody would have built their own systems.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:10.021]  We'd have an original, good, truly diverse internet.
[01:26:10.041 --> 01:26:10.701]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:26:10.981 --> 01:26:12.281]  Yes, we're in their trap now.
[01:26:13.222 --> 01:26:14.042]  Yeah, and you know,
[01:26:14.978 --> 01:26:23.186]  Something that I've talked about for a while is that, you know, 10 years ago was the time that we needed big people to invest in tech and they didn't do it.
[01:26:23.526 --> 01:26:27.530]  All the people that invested in tech 10, 15 years ago were leftists.
[01:26:27.610 --> 01:26:30.132]  Of course, because they wanted to control everything and they knew what it was going to be.
[01:26:30.152 --> 01:26:32.094]  Yeah, they can spy on us, control our lives.
[01:26:32.154 --> 01:26:32.555]  Exactly.
[01:26:33.413 --> 01:26:40.719]  So, I mean, the point that we're at now, I think we need to do major investment in those areas.
[01:26:40.759 --> 01:26:42.441]  We need to build our own infrastructure.
[01:26:42.461 --> 01:26:46.924]  It's going to be really hard to overcome the infrastructure that's already there, but
[01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:56.658]  Once they tighten down and they get rid of most of us off of these platforms, there'll be nowhere to go if we don't build the infrastructure first.
[01:26:56.958 --> 01:27:07.269]  And it will only be easier once we're off those platforms to separate, to make everyone confused, turn people against each other, things like that.
[01:27:08.951 --> 01:27:13.035]  Big Tech is already going after Gab and me and everybody.
[01:27:13.075 --> 01:27:14.076]  They want us shut down.
[01:27:14.116 --> 01:27:14.836]  They want a monopoly.
[01:27:14.876 --> 01:27:17.018]  It's not just Facebook didn't want Google+.
[01:27:17.319 --> 01:27:18.460]  They don't want anything.
[01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:31.532]  Right, and there's something to be said for that Big Tech allows some of these places to continue to exist because it's a place where you can say, well, look, we've got this place.
[01:27:31.552 --> 01:27:32.913]  We've got Gab you can go to.
[01:27:34.497 --> 01:27:36.759]  They want you there because you're not effective there.
[01:27:36.819 --> 01:27:39.300]  Nobody else there except for your own little bubble is there.
[01:27:39.861 --> 01:27:47.926]  So I love these platforms that are creating new spaces, but you still have to fight on their territory.
[01:27:47.946 --> 01:28:01.176]  Sure, but as a chicken or egg, what I'm saying is you use Gab or Telegram or InfoWars or Bandot Video as a place to back your stuff up, it's always there, and then use the enemy platform to promote that as you do sorties into their operations.
[01:28:01.937 --> 01:28:03.098]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:28:03.498 --> 01:28:07.001]  You use their platforms against them and use them to the best of your ability.
[01:28:07.622 --> 01:28:15.588]  And we need to create platforms like memeworld.com that can go into the future after things are shut down.
[01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:17.931]  Well said.
[01:28:18.171 --> 01:28:20.493]  Let's do a few more minutes, then open the phones up and I gotta go.
[01:28:20.513 --> 01:28:25.578]  A few more minutes with Carpe D'Antem on what the Dark Age will look like, which is just a few months away.
[01:28:25.598 --> 01:28:27.139]  I mean, everything's almost shut down now.
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:29.642]  I mean, InfoWars is one of the few places.
[01:28:29.662 --> 01:28:31.263]  MemeWorld.com, one of the few places.
[01:28:31.583 --> 01:28:32.885]  Band.Video, one of the few places.
[01:28:32.925 --> 01:28:34.026]  DrudgeReport.com, a few places.
[01:28:35.731 --> 01:28:37.732]  You know, I'm bouncing off the walls right now.
[01:28:37.752 --> 01:28:39.713]  I intended to only have Carpe donk to him.
[01:28:39.753 --> 01:28:45.296]  One of the top memers in the world, means one of the top artists, communicators, cave wall drawers, that's all it is.
[01:28:45.316 --> 01:28:53.240]  It's the most basic form of human communication, but it's a great art form, a lot of skill, video editor, you name it, wordsmith.
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:59.263]  I intended to have him on one segment, but he's been on now for 45 minutes because
[01:29:01.624 --> 01:29:02.365]  I read this stuff.
[01:29:02.465 --> 01:29:03.125]  I know this stuff.
[01:29:03.185 --> 01:29:04.446]  It was even in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:29:04.947 --> 01:29:05.948]  I've got the articles right here.
[01:29:05.968 --> 01:29:07.929]  We can put them on screen.
[01:29:07.949 --> 01:29:13.334]  $150 million plus dollars invested in February by a Chinese communist-controlled Chai Com company.
[01:29:14.775 --> 01:29:22.821]  And then they ban the Reddit, subreddit, Donald, and freeze it, put it in, quote, quarantine, where only the people already on it can basically use it.
[01:29:23.182 --> 01:29:24.042]  Other people can't find it.
[01:29:24.082 --> 01:29:25.263]  And now they're just shutting it down.
[01:29:25.323 --> 01:29:25.764]  It's dead.
[01:29:26.772 --> 01:29:31.935]  And that's a scandal that Trump's number one website, bigger than his campaign site, that's subreddit.
[01:29:33.335 --> 01:29:38.818]  They have an MIT study where the internet gets its memes from and they said most of it from the Donald subreddit.
[01:29:40.239 --> 01:29:41.899]  And we put up with it being shut down.
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.121]  You think you'd go over to Communist China and have a U.S.
[01:29:45.161 --> 01:29:49.923]  company buy something that supported, say, Xi and be shut down?
[01:29:49.963 --> 01:29:50.704]  He's a dictator.
[01:29:50.744 --> 01:29:51.444]  Trump was elected.
[01:29:52.858 --> 01:30:00.280]  But when you read the Washington Post, pull that up please, Xi must crush Trump to save America is the headline.
[01:30:03.221 --> 01:30:12.144]  Arguably the most important newspaper in the United States, at least one of the top two, saying Xi needs to crush President Trump.
[01:30:13.604 --> 01:30:15.145]  We can't find it all that in the Post, no big deal.
[01:30:15.805 --> 01:30:18.866]  But we're live right now, we're talking about all of this.
[01:30:19.806 --> 01:30:20.946]  This is all unfolding.
[01:30:21.947 --> 01:30:22.527]  This is real.
[01:30:24.201 --> 01:30:25.222]  And so, we're here.
[01:30:25.562 --> 01:30:28.343]  And they're going down to individual accounts now.
[01:30:28.623 --> 01:30:31.265]  They're saying people can't show women at a shooting range.
[01:30:31.545 --> 01:30:39.749]  The Republicans can't run ads that say we're looking for strong women to join the party.
[01:30:39.889 --> 01:30:41.010]  Anything effective is banned.
[01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:42.711]  And I'm sorry, I put out fake news.
[01:30:43.131 --> 01:30:44.351]  It wasn't Crush, it's worse.
[01:30:44.812 --> 01:30:46.312]  Xi's choice, destroy Trump.
[01:30:46.352 --> 01:30:47.133]  Print me that article, please.
[01:30:47.513 --> 01:30:49.194]  Xi's choice, destroy Trump!
[01:30:50.604 --> 01:30:52.605]  Save him and weaken America.
[01:30:53.066 --> 01:30:54.226]  What a sick statement.
[01:30:55.107 --> 01:31:03.912]  When China has had a one-sided deal to shut us down, they're shipping fentanyl in, 25 tons got caught, that'd kill a 10 million.
[01:31:03.932 --> 01:31:05.253]  606 million and change.
[01:31:06.333 --> 01:31:09.295]  I mean, my God, they own Hollywood, all the anti-American race war crap.
[01:31:09.515 --> 01:31:14.378]  They are demoralizing us, they admit they are, with allies in our own system.
[01:31:14.718 --> 01:31:15.259]  It's sick.
[01:31:15.899 --> 01:31:17.120]  And here we are, Carpe Diem.
[01:31:18.231 --> 01:31:39.749]  Watching it happen, and I know Trump's had you to the White House, you've been there a few times, and you're a great guy, and Trump's, I love Trump, but my heavens to Betsy, I know what he does, I'm people that know him well, he watches Fox and CNN, and he reads the New York Times, and he visits Drudge sometimes, and he, and you know, and the Secret Service shows him clips of Infowars, talked to some folks just last week about that, but
[01:31:41.443 --> 01:31:44.764]  And their big fear is keep Alex away from him and keep you away from him.
[01:31:44.804 --> 01:31:46.664]  And we know what's going on, compadre.
[01:31:47.325 --> 01:31:48.545]  And, you know, I've been offered the money.
[01:31:49.785 --> 01:31:54.667]  People think... I used to tell people, hey, I got offered $10 million a year 15 years ago to sell out.
[01:31:54.687 --> 01:31:55.887]  People go, ah, you never did.
[01:31:55.907 --> 01:31:56.747]  That's so much money.
[01:31:57.107 --> 01:31:59.448]  Folks, InfoWars is gigantic, even then.
[01:32:00.868 --> 01:32:06.390]  They spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year from Soros just propping up things like Vox or Vice.
[01:32:08.410 --> 01:32:08.971]  Vox gets 250 mil.
[01:32:11.121 --> 01:32:11.922]  From NBC.
[01:32:12.582 --> 01:32:15.104]  Disney put $2 billion last time I checked in device.
[01:32:16.345 --> 01:32:18.827]  So they can do anti-Alex Jones and anti-Trump videos.
[01:32:20.568 --> 01:32:21.609]  Until the cows come home.
[01:32:23.791 --> 01:32:27.213]  We're operating on 20-something million dollars a year.
[01:32:28.334 --> 01:32:29.815]  And it's getting a much bigger effect, folks.
[01:32:29.835 --> 01:32:30.396]  But think about that.
[01:32:30.416 --> 01:32:35.039]  I have to sell $40 million of product, because on average, it's 100% markup.
[01:32:35.079 --> 01:32:35.980]  And we're not even doing that now.
[01:32:37.256 --> 01:32:38.818]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com, folks.
[01:32:38.878 --> 01:32:39.979]  Stand against the Chi-Coms.
[01:32:40.279 --> 01:32:41.180]  Hollywood, all of them.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:42.321]  We can stay on the air.
[01:32:42.381 --> 01:32:42.821]  We can do it.
[01:32:42.841 --> 01:32:46.024]  But only when you support us financially and get great products you already need.
[01:32:46.265 --> 01:32:48.066]  And only when you spread the damn word.
[01:32:48.266 --> 01:32:49.287]  And I want to thank Matt Drudge.
[01:32:49.488 --> 01:32:50.749]  He's been linking to us every day.
[01:32:51.289 --> 01:32:57.956]  And I got to tell you, that massive traffic in InfoWars is sending us a lot of the new people we are able to deprogram and show what's happening.
[01:32:58.578 --> 01:32:59.538]  So thank you, Matt Drudge.
[01:32:59.558 --> 01:33:01.299]  But Matt Drudge understands this is a fight.
[01:33:01.559 --> 01:33:04.981]  I haven't even gotten to the story he linked to today about what Facebook's up to.
[01:33:05.001 --> 01:33:05.861]  We'll do that next segment.
[01:33:06.381 --> 01:33:07.202]  Then I'll open the phones up.
[01:33:07.222 --> 01:33:09.342]  But Carpe D'Antem, I keep interrupting.
[01:33:09.362 --> 01:33:12.304]  You've got five minutes to recap it all, to talk about it and what we're facing.
[01:33:12.624 --> 01:33:22.428]  And the ChaiCom government that admittedly runs and owns that company, 150 mil, buys the Reddit, takes control of it, kills Donald, and then we're talking about
[01:33:23.851 --> 01:33:27.692]  This crypt that people are still wanting to keep going.
[01:33:27.712 --> 01:33:29.353]  And I get it, but it's gone, brother.
[01:33:29.393 --> 01:33:29.833]  It's gone.
[01:33:30.093 --> 01:33:34.295]  People need to go to memeworld.com and they need to abandon ship and go to other places now.
[01:33:34.315 --> 01:33:39.437]  And everybody needs to say on the Reddit, hey, come here before it's too late so you at least get some of the people.
[01:33:39.857 --> 01:33:41.637]  Everybody knows, oh, don't do that or you'll get banned too.
[01:33:41.977 --> 01:33:43.978]  We're already self-censoring prisoners.
[01:33:44.338 --> 01:33:45.799]  This is the road to destruction.
[01:33:45.839 --> 01:33:46.159]  Go ahead.
[01:33:47.537 --> 01:33:58.656]  Well, you know, to the credit of Donald, the metrics have actually maintained over the last few months, even in quarantine.
[01:33:58.676 --> 01:34:00.239]  They've still got new subscribers.
[01:34:02.871 --> 01:34:13.494]  Again, we're going into another point where there's an appeal, and every single time you do an appeal and you lose, the time doubles.
[01:34:13.774 --> 01:34:17.175]  So it started out with a 30-day quarantine, then it went to a 60-day.
[01:34:17.655 --> 01:34:23.836]  If this one is denied, we're going to be up to, I think January is the next time that you can appeal.
[01:34:23.856 --> 01:34:25.537]  Think how authoritarian that is.
[01:34:25.597 --> 01:34:28.498]  They call it a quarantine, like we're a disease.
[01:34:28.618 --> 01:34:29.678]  Gosh, these people are sick.
[01:34:30.643 --> 01:34:33.764]  Yeah, I mean, they're not even hiding what it is.
[01:34:33.904 --> 01:34:36.125]  I mean, they're keeping us away from everyone.
[01:34:36.866 --> 01:34:39.247]  Now, they've been doing that for four years.
[01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:43.128]  They've been pretending like we don't exist.
[01:34:43.468 --> 01:34:47.530]  They've been pretending that... So you're in a death camp, they just haven't killed you yet?
[01:34:48.811 --> 01:34:52.392]  Yeah, they've been marching us around in circles for four years.
[01:34:53.893 --> 01:34:59.615]  Now, again, I want to stress this point that the amount of people that still visit the Donald
[01:35:00.544 --> 01:35:06.528]  It's greater than the viewership of Fox News on an average night.
[01:35:06.548 --> 01:35:10.911]  I mean, there's millions and millions and millions of people that visit that site every single day.
[01:35:10.931 --> 01:35:13.212]  And Trump won't do a damn thing, the Chinese government came and did it.
[01:35:13.252 --> 01:35:16.455]  I mean, the big fat dragon's like, it's mine now, haha!
[01:35:18.156 --> 01:35:21.658]  Yeah, well, I mean, that's something that we need to get his attention about.
[01:35:22.198 --> 01:35:24.720]  I think that it is high time that we have
[01:35:28.467 --> 01:35:33.030]  Him talking about one of his greatest assets.
[01:35:34.351 --> 01:35:39.255]  You talked about the memes and the study that was done about where memes come from.
[01:35:39.655 --> 01:35:48.302]  The Donald is responsible for at least 15 of the most viral things that President Trump has ever tweeted.
[01:35:49.462 --> 01:35:55.067]  I mean, to be fair, like six to eight of them were mine, but, you know,
[01:35:57.799 --> 01:36:03.542]  The wrestling gif that sparked the CNN blackmail, that came from the Donald.
[01:36:04.643 --> 01:36:10.006]  All of the things that Something Wicked has done has come from the Donald.
[01:36:10.386 --> 01:36:16.390]  The Batman video that got removed from his channel came from the Donald.
[01:36:17.130 --> 01:36:18.171]  The memes come from there.
[01:36:18.551 --> 01:36:25.575]  I am sure that Greenland, Trump Greenland, Trump Tower,
[01:36:26.471 --> 01:36:27.812]  Picture came from the Donald.
[01:36:27.972 --> 01:36:30.414]  Where he said, I promise not to do this.
[01:36:31.135 --> 01:36:31.775]  Right, exactly.
[01:36:32.235 --> 01:36:35.118]  All of those viral moments, they all come from this place.
[01:36:35.638 --> 01:36:40.822]  And most of the memes that you're going to see running around Twitter are a day old from the Donald.
[01:36:41.542 --> 01:36:45.365]  I mean, other than the stuff that I put out, because I put it out on Twitter at the same time I do everything else.
[01:36:45.465 --> 01:36:50.269]  And again, I just want to win, and that's why I was so happy to hear you were building Meme World and why I'm trying to promote it.
[01:36:50.529 --> 01:36:53.351]  So that we don't lose the Donald, but they've already done it to a great extent.
[01:36:53.691 --> 01:37:00.616]  And then again, President Trump, they've got Jim Hoft over at Gateway Pundit, great folks saying, hey, what happened to Drudge?
[01:37:00.996 --> 01:37:04.818]  Well, what happened to Trump's all I'm saying is that we need Trump to take action.
[01:37:04.858 --> 01:37:10.202]  This is a foreign government, comes and buys the most effective place, bigger than Trump's Twitter probably.
[01:37:10.582 --> 01:37:13.924]  The Chinese government basically took the equivalent of Trump's Twitter away from him.
[01:37:14.184 --> 01:37:16.546]  And if he puts up with it, it really upsets me.
[01:37:17.287 --> 01:37:25.740]  Well, yeah, and it upsets me as well that, I mean, that Donald is largely responsible for Trump's election.
[01:37:26.682 --> 01:37:30.748]  Without the Donald, I don't think he gets as close.
[01:37:32.071 --> 01:37:33.853]  Well, it's like fingers make up a fist.
[01:37:33.973 --> 01:37:41.121]  I mean, Drudge would be the thumb, InfoWars would be the index finger, The Donald would be the middle finger, literally, you know, flipping off the establishment.
[01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:47.268]  And then all the other grassroots stuff, Facebook's the other fingers and things, and exactly, and YouTube, and they're taking it all away!
[01:37:47.288 --> 01:37:49.010]  They're taking it all away, except Drudge!
[01:37:49.911 --> 01:37:51.733]  Drudge is the only thing that hasn't been crippled.
[01:37:52.153 --> 01:37:52.294]  What?
[01:37:53.024 --> 01:37:53.785]  And we're letting them.
[01:37:53.965 --> 01:37:54.665]  And we can't let them.
[01:38:15.035 --> 01:38:18.157]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:38:18.177 --> 01:38:19.358]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:38:20.478 --> 01:38:21.859]  And you know, I'm going to tell you something.
[01:38:21.879 --> 01:38:23.260]  This country's done.
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:24.601]  This country's soft.
[01:38:24.901 --> 01:38:26.001]  This country's stupid.
[01:38:26.282 --> 01:38:27.122]  This country's weak.
[01:38:28.303 --> 01:38:28.543]  It is.
[01:38:28.603 --> 01:38:28.983]  It's done.
[01:38:29.043 --> 01:38:30.324]  We kill babies after they're born.
[01:38:30.644 --> 01:38:32.845]  Nobody cares the Chinese government bought Reddit.
[01:38:33.526 --> 01:38:34.326]  That's old news.
[01:38:34.386 --> 01:38:35.847]  No, it's like, so what?
[01:38:36.808 --> 01:38:40.610]  Everyone loves it because we have emasculated men.
[01:38:41.490 --> 01:38:43.812]  We have a country of little bitches.
[01:38:45.225 --> 01:38:47.126]  And grovelers and ass kissers.
[01:38:47.526 --> 01:38:52.249]  You go out in public and you look at the average American, you're talking about weak, pathetic people.
[01:38:52.670 --> 01:38:55.531]  Stupid, dumb, devil worshippers.
[01:38:57.192 --> 01:38:58.093]  Yeah, that's the truth.
[01:38:58.873 --> 01:39:00.675]  There are a lot of good people left in this nation.
[01:39:02.075 --> 01:39:03.616]  But the churches have been taken over.
[01:39:04.797 --> 01:39:06.218]  The systems have been taken over.
[01:39:08.459 --> 01:39:14.043]  And people don't have any fighting spirit except to fight against anything good.
[01:39:15.555 --> 01:39:16.236]  That's all it is.
[01:39:16.677 --> 01:39:17.038]  Period.
[01:39:17.318 --> 01:39:18.180]  They don't have the spark.
[01:39:19.562 --> 01:39:22.087]  I was watching The West, that PBS documentary.
[01:39:23.854 --> 01:39:29.538]  Well, I was on the elliptical this weekend and it was just the black and white photos of everybody's eyes.
[01:39:30.339 --> 01:39:33.901]  It didn't matter if they were Chinese coolies or white people or black people or Native Americans.
[01:39:34.402 --> 01:39:38.665]  In the black and white photos, you can take black and white photos today and they don't have that look in the eyes.
[01:39:39.205 --> 01:39:41.487]  I mean, you can almost see the color in people's eyes.
[01:39:41.967 --> 01:39:42.868]  They were so powerful.
[01:39:43.348 --> 01:39:48.912]  And then you just see it and it's like the soul has been sucked out of people.
[01:39:50.606 --> 01:39:57.749]  They're in a mesmerized sleep state, and medically they are.
[01:39:57.809 --> 01:40:13.277]  When you watch television all day, particularly that isn't interactive, or you get on the internet, it creates a flicker rate that just eases people into suspended disbelief, and then they're programmed, and then they're gone.
[01:40:15.191 --> 01:40:18.533]  To where now, really all we're doing is conditioning people in a way.
[01:40:18.573 --> 01:40:21.935]  It's like, oh yeah, world government, yeah, the chi-coms, you know, own Reddit.
[01:40:22.516 --> 01:40:24.177]  Yeah, they bought it up and shut the president up.
[01:40:26.418 --> 01:40:28.740]  And the president just sits there in the White House and puts up with it.
[01:40:31.401 --> 01:40:32.462]  Oh, they're a private company!
[01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:50.650]  And the Chinese government has $900 billion a year of our money they steal in one-sided deals that the globalists set up to come in here and buy everything this nation has or ever will have.
[01:40:50.671 --> 01:40:57.276]  I want to play this report.
[01:40:57.456 --> 01:40:58.256]  It's really important.
[01:41:00.178 --> 01:41:03.080]  I want to play this report because it really
[01:41:05.213 --> 01:41:05.814]  That explains it all.
[01:41:06.695 --> 01:41:09.498]  Kids lead humanity into carbon taxation hell.
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:12.661]  The John Bowne Report.
[01:41:13.883 --> 01:41:15.524]  And it really just explains it all.
[01:41:15.584 --> 01:41:17.487]  Then I'm going to give the number out and we'll try to take some phone calls.
[01:41:17.527 --> 01:41:18.307]  The NoTep Jesus.
[01:41:18.788 --> 01:41:20.129]  Always informative, always amazing.
[01:41:20.150 --> 01:41:20.930]  He's coming on the show.
[01:41:22.552 --> 01:41:26.276]  So let's go ahead and go to that report that deals with people like Greta Thunberg.
[01:41:26.296 --> 01:41:26.537]  Here we go.
[01:41:27.592 --> 01:41:49.462]  Some of the models suggest to Dr. Maslowski that there is a 75% chance that the entire North Polar ice cap during summer, during some of the summer months, could be completely ice-free within the next five to seven years.
[01:41:50.483 --> 01:41:52.344]  Climate change madness is upon us.
[01:41:52.804 --> 01:42:08.174]  Without any consideration of the consequences they will surely face, a generation blinded by junk science and blame accepts the carbon taxation scheme of a global elite class largely responsible for the very pollution and erosion plaguing the earth.
[01:42:08.495 --> 01:42:19.522]  As someone who already struggles with anxiety and struggles with depression, from my understanding of climate change and what I experience, watching our government knowingly perpetuate the climate crisis is extremely overwhelming.
[01:42:20.383 --> 01:42:25.687]  I wrestle with this anxiety every day from the moment that I wake up in the morning to the moment I fall asleep at night.
[01:42:26.608 --> 01:42:34.014]  If we keep going on with business as usual, both Honduras and New York, the places where my family and I are from, will forever be lost to the sea.
[01:42:34.642 --> 01:42:37.884]  February 2018 was colder than February 1998.
[01:42:38.084 --> 01:42:47.931]  If someone is tempted to argue that the reason for recent record cooling periods is that global temperatures are getting more volatile, it's not true.
[01:42:48.111 --> 01:42:54.736]  The volatility of monthly global average temperatures since 2000 is only two-thirds what it was from 1880 to 1999.
[01:42:57.117 --> 01:43:14.055]  Add to that, evidence from NASA reveals that the Earth is entering a solar minimum, basically a low point in sunspot activity, and the growing possibility of what has been known as the Maunder Minimum, which would drive temperatures below the average and could produce a mini ice age.
[01:43:14.235 --> 01:43:36.666]  Failed presidential candidate and worthless New York City Mayor de Blasio, guided by the Rockefeller New World Order technocratic communist vision for America, allowed the students of New York City to skip school and pour onto the streets to embrace their misguided concern for the earth, creating a wave of copycat protests across the country.
[01:43:37.173 --> 01:43:50.180]  If these kids want to know what kind of controversy they actually face, just take a look at the carbon pricing scheme in Australia, introduced by the Gillard Labour Government in 2011 as the Clean Energy Act of 2011, which came into effect in July of 2012.
[01:43:50.241 --> 01:43:53.082]  The scheme was repealed in July of 2014.
[01:43:54.463 --> 01:44:01.427]  It did very little to curb any investment in coal as it was intended, but it did make a lot of Australians very angry.
[01:44:01.707 --> 01:44:06.090]  And I've got no money because I've got a lunatic government that's been putting taxes on me to call the planet!
[01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:09.912]  It's a form of socialism masquerading as environmentalism.
[01:44:10.173 --> 01:44:16.757]  It may well be, as you say Michael, that most Australian economists think that a carbon tax or emissions trading scheme is the way to go.
[01:44:17.483 --> 01:44:20.445]  Um, maybe that's a comment on the quality of our economists.
[01:44:20.685 --> 01:44:24.228]  Meanwhile, the propagandized media drills it in.
[01:44:24.528 --> 01:44:37.158]  Increasingly, people are much more comfortable saying, we've got wildfires like we haven't seen, we've got drought like we haven't seen, we've got flooding like we haven't seen, we've got hurricanes like we haven't seen, we've got melting like we haven't seen, and there might be some connection and it might be climate.
[01:44:37.779 --> 01:44:39.662]  How are we going to screw the people?
[01:44:39.962 --> 01:44:41.925]  How are we going to kill indigenous cultures?
[01:44:41.945 --> 01:44:43.827]  How are we going to mess with the Amazon?
[01:44:44.127 --> 01:44:53.940]  As the old scam rears its ugly head again, a reinvigorated call for the so-called expert economist support of Al Gore and the World Bank's carbon tax.
[01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:56.103]  As the Globe Gazette reported,
[01:44:56.383 --> 01:44:56.703]  U.S.
[01:44:56.743 --> 01:45:06.169]  economists have joined together to recommend a tax on carbon emissions as the most effective way of controlling carbon emissions and mitigating climate change.
[01:45:06.429 --> 01:45:14.414]  Recommending a carbon tax offers the most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is necessary.
[01:45:14.694 --> 01:45:19.517]  A carbon tax should increase every year until emission reduction goals are met.
[01:45:19.898 --> 01:45:23.460]  A sufficiently robust and gradually rising carbon tax
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:25.481]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:50.728 --> 01:45:58.695]  Broadcasting worldwide, I'm your host Alex Jones, and President Trump gave an incredible speech this morning that we're going to be playing more of in the next hour.
[01:45:59.415 --> 01:46:00.476]  We've already mentioned some of it.
[01:46:00.516 --> 01:46:06.481]  There's a very important article by Jamie White that's up on Infowars.com that needs to go extremely viral.
[01:46:07.682 --> 01:46:08.463]  Trump to the UN.
[01:46:08.483 --> 01:46:10.505]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[01:46:11.670 --> 01:46:13.753]  The future belongs to sovereign, independent nations.
[01:46:13.853 --> 01:46:15.115]  That is just so beautiful.
[01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:18.360]  Our own corporate media is saying nation states shouldn't even exist now.
[01:46:19.281 --> 01:46:22.165]  And then he goes on on globalism and how criminal it is.
[01:46:22.225 --> 01:46:25.690]  He gets into open borders, big tech censorship and endless wars.
[01:46:26.573 --> 01:46:28.634]  And says he's taking action on all of it.
[01:46:28.674 --> 01:46:30.435]  He's been trying to block a new war with Iran.
[01:46:30.455 --> 01:46:32.096]  This is an amazing time.
[01:46:32.676 --> 01:46:43.041]  Lord Christopher Monkton is going to join us on Greta Thunberg and the way she's being rejected so much here in her bizarre Hitlerian rants with the viral video we have posted on Infowars.com.
[01:46:43.061 --> 01:46:45.582]  But first off, let's go ahead and play this clip of Trump.
[01:46:47.145 --> 01:46:48.966]  Telling it like it is against world government.
[01:46:48.986 --> 01:46:51.428]  We've come so far where they denied world government all these years.
[01:46:52.049 --> 01:46:53.990]  And now it's here and now we're saying we don't want it.
[01:46:54.050 --> 01:47:00.035]  We don't want foreign multinational corporations allied with the shycoms buying us up and treating us like we're Chinese slaves.
[01:47:00.576 --> 01:47:01.316]  Like they've done Reddit.
[01:47:02.237 --> 01:47:02.617]  Here it is.
[01:47:04.178 --> 01:47:14.907]  Looking around and all over this large magnificent planet the truth is plain to see
[01:47:16.277 --> 01:47:19.638]  If you want freedom, take pride in your country.
[01:47:20.899 --> 01:47:24.820]  If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:29.422]  And if you want peace, love your nation.
[01:47:31.202 --> 01:47:38.045]  Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first.
[01:47:39.245 --> 01:47:42.026]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[01:47:43.046 --> 01:47:44.947]  The future belongs to patriots.
[01:47:46.021 --> 01:48:00.032]  The future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors, and honor the differences that make each country special and unique.
[01:48:01.073 --> 01:48:07.698]  Instead of transferring our power to unelected globalist organizations with front people like Greta Thunberg, the autistic
[01:48:09.536 --> 01:48:11.338]  Victim, really, I think, of the brainwashing we've seen.
[01:48:11.438 --> 01:48:19.824]  Christopher Monken is the leading expert, I would say, of everybody out there, even Mark Moreno, who's advised Congress, of course, on the fraud of the carbon tax and all of it.
[01:48:19.844 --> 01:48:24.548]  And they're screeching and squawking and abuse of the children, trying to tell them the world's ending.
[01:48:25.188 --> 01:48:27.649]  Now they're saying in 10 years, Beto and others are.
[01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:33.592]  So I'm glad you could join us, Mr. Monckton, Lord Monckton, to get into all of this, because this is an amazing moment.
[01:48:33.612 --> 01:48:34.673]  I want to get into Greta Thunberg.
[01:48:34.693 --> 01:48:35.893]  You're somewhat of an expert on her.
[01:48:36.253 --> 01:48:40.355]  Her mother says she's psychic and can see the devil gas that plants breathe, carbon dioxide.
[01:48:40.375 --> 01:48:43.497]  But, wow, what do you make of Trump's United Nations speech?
[01:48:44.677 --> 01:48:52.281]  Well, this was one of the finest speeches ever to have been delivered at that largely useless organization.
[01:48:52.921 --> 01:48:56.664]  The United Nations has long outlived any usefulness it once had.
[01:48:57.105 --> 01:49:01.508]  It's trying to substitute itself for individual national governments.
[01:49:01.909 --> 01:49:06.693]  It's using the climate change scam as one of its major weapons in doing that.
[01:49:07.133 --> 01:49:09.575]  And Mr Trump isn't buying any of it.
[01:49:09.916 --> 01:49:13.719]  And he made a speech which was at once statesman-like.
[01:49:14.272 --> 01:49:17.173]  But also, wringingly patriotic.
[01:49:17.673 --> 01:49:28.157]  And there is a man who is saying to his own countrymen, whatever you may think of me, I will stand up for you and for my country.
[01:49:28.537 --> 01:49:33.759]  And I'll stand up against these global creeps who are trying to take over.
[01:49:34.463 --> 01:49:36.883]  And who elects the United Nations?
[01:49:37.244 --> 01:49:37.604]  Nobody.
[01:49:37.764 --> 01:49:39.864]  Who elects the European Union?
[01:49:40.284 --> 01:49:42.004]  Nobody elects the European Commission.
[01:49:42.064 --> 01:49:44.885]  It's an unelected body which has absolute power.
[01:49:45.405 --> 01:49:47.585]  Or who elects the Law of the Sea Conference?
[01:49:48.005 --> 01:49:49.386]  Who elects the World Bank?
[01:49:49.666 --> 01:49:52.126]  Who elects the International Monetary Fund?
[01:49:52.606 --> 01:49:53.006]  Nobody.
[01:49:53.826 --> 01:50:03.188]  Every time power is transferred from elected hands here to unelected hands at these various international and increasingly global bodies,
[01:50:03.965 --> 01:50:09.907]  Democracy dies a little and that is the main purport of what Mr Trump was saying.
[01:50:10.408 --> 01:50:19.391]  He was saying if you want democracy then you have to look for it in your nation because you will not find it in any of these international organisations.
[01:50:19.791 --> 01:50:24.453]  And the only way the United Nations can, in my view, be allowed to survive at all
[01:50:25.348 --> 01:50:32.913]  Is if in future all the delegates to that body are elected by the peoples of the countries that constitute it.
[01:50:33.193 --> 01:50:37.156]  And that's going to be difficult in countries like China where they're not used to electing anyone.
[01:50:37.396 --> 01:50:42.359]  Well, they're going to have to get used to that idea because otherwise the UN has no future.
[01:50:42.699 --> 01:50:45.942]  And in effect, Mr. Trump was giving it notice.
[01:50:46.402 --> 01:50:51.125]  You either become democratic or you fail and you go.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.973]  Now, we had you on today, very well said.
[01:50:58.561 --> 01:51:05.004]  Lord Monckton, to get into Greta Thunberg, who you're quite the expert on, this is breaking news on InfoWars.com.
[01:51:05.464 --> 01:51:08.985]  Greta's parents reported to child services in Sweden this morning.
[01:51:10.226 --> 01:51:11.106]  So that's going on.
[01:51:11.126 --> 01:51:16.808]  Earlier today, a private person posted pictures of her concern about Greta Thunberg for child abuse of the parents.
[01:51:17.249 --> 01:51:22.391]  The report was allegedly sent to the district administrator for Stockholm and is being taken very seriously.
[01:51:22.411 --> 01:51:23.871]  I'd say she has Stockholm syndrome.
[01:51:24.551 --> 01:51:27.833]  And a lot of people talk about how she just seems completely crazed.
[01:51:28.473 --> 01:51:29.653]  Wild eyed, very hateful.
[01:51:29.673 --> 01:51:31.954]  She sees Trump come in to the U.N.
[01:51:32.094 --> 01:51:36.496]  and she's right behind him and looks at him with just what I would call a psychotic look.
[01:51:36.676 --> 01:51:41.377]  She's up there hating everyone, blaming everyone, saying we're watching you, we're coming after you.
[01:51:41.397 --> 01:51:45.719]  I mean, she is a very deranged person right now.
[01:51:45.759 --> 01:51:46.459]  You're an expert on her.
[01:51:47.619 --> 01:51:49.040]  How would you quantify this young lady?
[01:51:51.855 --> 01:51:59.164]  I think she is a victim, a victim of ruthless Marxist indoctrination in the schools.
[01:51:59.524 --> 01:52:04.550]  The Marxists who were originally behind this global warming scam, they are the ones who are driving it.
[01:52:04.590 --> 01:52:10.938]  They can't believe that the West is destroying its economies at the rate that it is doing.
[01:52:11.551 --> 01:52:16.813]  And now they're even using children, just as fascists and communists always have.
[01:52:16.873 --> 01:52:31.398]  You had the Hitler Youth, you had the Komsomol in Russia, you had the young Chinese communists, all of these organizations which regimented children and exploited them for the political ends of adults.
[01:52:31.918 --> 01:52:34.699]  And I think, I feel very sorry for Greta Thunberg.
[01:52:34.719 --> 01:52:41.403]  Of course she'll end up with the Nobel Peace Prize and everybody will say what a wonderful thing it is that she's trying to save the planet.
[01:52:41.883 --> 01:52:45.585]  I think we should not too much question her motives.
[01:52:46.005 --> 01:52:55.830]  We should question those who indoctrinated her so completely that she cannot realise the value of somebody with whom she disagrees, such as Mr Trump.
[01:52:56.468 --> 01:53:04.495]  So I don't think we should get into trying to psychoanalyse her by looking at the face of hatred which she's just put up there.
[01:53:04.836 --> 01:53:16.326]  Small children tend to put on faces like that and it doesn't mean that they are full of hatred, it just means they haven't yet learnt to control their facial muscles and control their emotions.
[01:53:16.606 --> 01:53:18.048]  But what we should say is this.
[01:53:19.019 --> 01:53:31.544]  That she and the millions of others who took to the streets and started to say that they were going on strike against their own education, which is a pretty silly thing to go on strike about, for the sake of saving the planet.
[01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:33.985]  First of all, it's not going to do any good.
[01:53:34.766 --> 01:53:35.346]  Secondly,
[01:53:36.056 --> 01:53:38.337]  Nothing of this is necessary.
[01:53:38.757 --> 01:53:53.765]  A brilliant paper just published by Professor Patrick Frank, a good friend of mine at the Stanford Linear Accelerator, has demonstrated formally, and beyond all dispute, it was reviewed by the most eminent people on the other side of the case and they could not fault it.
[01:53:54.472 --> 01:54:07.520]  That the climate models on which the case that Greta Thunberg is arguing are based are incapable of telling you the time of day, let alone telling you what the weather is going to be like in a hundred years' time.
[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:11.522]  They are valueless for making any predictions about global warming.
[01:54:11.582 --> 01:54:13.043]  And Christopher, let's do one more segment.
[01:54:13.123 --> 01:54:17.006]  We only have time for one, but I think you can do two, because I want to get into Breitbart's excellent article.
[01:54:17.446 --> 01:54:18.847]  41 times they were completely wrong.
[01:54:19.267 --> 01:54:21.849]  They always say the science is settled, everyone agrees, but the truth is
[01:54:22.509 --> 01:54:26.192]  The majority of scientists are coming out saying it's a fraud all along.
[01:54:26.232 --> 01:54:27.233]  It's totally insane.
[01:54:27.653 --> 01:54:28.895]  It's a giant power grab.
[01:54:29.235 --> 01:54:32.958]  And I want to ask you just briefly as we go to break though, what period would you call this?
[01:54:32.978 --> 01:54:38.863]  Because they're buying up the media, censoring everyone, saying arrest us, but all the evidence shows they're liars and it seems like they're panicking.
[01:54:39.864 --> 01:54:42.847]  Is all this bullying death throes of their giant fraud?
[01:54:44.196 --> 01:54:46.198]  I think they know it's coming to an end.
[01:54:46.238 --> 01:54:48.699]  The people who are behind this are a very small number.
[01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:56.465]  There are an awful lot of useful idiots who have drifted along with it because it seems to be the right thing to do to care for the planet.
[01:54:56.505 --> 01:54:59.788]  I mean, it pushes all the right buttons.
[01:54:59.968 --> 01:55:01.389]  It appeals to human generosity.
[01:55:01.869 --> 01:55:02.349]  Well, stay there.
[01:55:02.409 --> 01:55:03.350]  Tell us about it when we come back.
[01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:05.651]  Lord Christopher Monckton's our guest.
[01:55:05.691 --> 01:55:06.572]  Just amazing work.
[01:55:06.612 --> 01:55:11.674]  And they've broken this article, whatsupwiththat.com, that the Child Protective Services are being sent to her house.
[01:55:12.315 --> 01:55:14.776]  She's obviously a brainwashed, hate-filled zombie.
[01:55:14.796 --> 01:55:16.057]  They've really ruined this little girl.
[01:55:16.077 --> 01:55:18.118]  Hopefully she can be rehabilitated somehow.
[01:55:20.099 --> 01:55:25.942]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm ashamed we're going to have open phones today, but we've got Christopher Monckton on, a Greta Thunberg expert.
[01:55:26.923 --> 01:55:30.165]  And then we have Ho-Tip Jesus, great political activist, joining us next hour.
[01:55:30.185 --> 01:55:31.645]  I'll try to open the phones then, but listen.
[01:55:33.066 --> 01:55:35.207]  You better believe when I start the show tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:55:35.227 --> 01:55:37.949]  Central, we're going to play a bunch of Trump's 45-minute historic speech.
[01:55:38.589 --> 01:55:45.153]  Owen Schroer, when the war room starts, in about an hour and 13 minutes, he's going to air the whole speech.
[01:55:46.172 --> 01:55:47.172]  In his first hour.
[01:55:47.652 --> 01:55:50.533]  In fact, that's exactly enough time to do it because there's 15 minutes of ads each hour.
[01:55:50.993 --> 01:55:54.334]  So he's going to air the whole speech, maybe even go into the second hour and analyze it.
[01:55:54.354 --> 01:55:59.736]  He went after big tech censorship, went after communism, went after big corporations trying to get rid of national sovereignty.
[01:56:00.076 --> 01:56:02.837]  He struck at the root, and as Lord Christopher Monckton just said,
[01:56:04.611 --> 01:56:06.231]  I was watching him when we played the clip.
[01:56:06.331 --> 01:56:09.252]  He's on the TV over there, even when he's not live on air.
[01:56:09.472 --> 01:56:13.793]  And I saw real satisfaction gleam in his eyes.
[01:56:13.853 --> 01:56:16.714]  And I was getting chills, even though I'd read the transcript, I hadn't seen it yet.
[01:56:17.474 --> 01:56:20.054]  And because globalism is pure authoritarianism.
[01:56:20.134 --> 01:56:22.315]  It was a Hitlerian plan, the EU was.
[01:56:22.995 --> 01:56:27.616]  And to know how evil it is and how anti-human it is, I'm getting literal chills.
[01:56:28.601 --> 01:56:32.944]  Like, I only get a pleasure when I see my children born and they're healthy.
[01:56:33.464 --> 01:56:36.126]  I mean, I'm having major endorphin releases right now.
[01:56:36.826 --> 01:56:37.847]  I'm as high as a kite.
[01:56:38.647 --> 01:56:41.549]  And we should be, because Trump doing this means he's for real.
[01:56:42.350 --> 01:56:44.691]  And this is so devastating to these authoritarians.
[01:56:44.951 --> 01:56:50.315]  Because as Lord Monckton said, it's a very few billionaire globalists that want this panopticonic carbon tax.
[01:56:50.355 --> 01:56:53.117]  Bloomberg, you know, a few others.
[01:56:54.261 --> 01:57:02.330]  They want to be able to run this and control this, and then they've got foreign governments aiding and funding it, like China and Saudi Arabia, because they want our fossil fuels shut down.
[01:57:02.670 --> 01:57:11.260]  Lord Monckton, Greta Thunberg talks about billions are going to die, the sea levels are rising, the same old lie, but if they cut all carbon use, wouldn't it kill billions?
[01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:11.921]  The studies show.
[01:57:11.961 --> 01:57:14.444]  I mean, it's just insane how evil globalism is.
[01:57:15.379 --> 01:57:16.962]  Let's get the figures straight.
[01:57:17.303 --> 01:57:23.255]  It's already killing tens of millions every year in Africa because since 2010,
[01:57:25.339 --> 01:57:36.521]  The World Bank, the unelected World Bank, the globalist World Bank, has refused to lend to poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, desperate to give electricity to their people.
[01:57:37.022 --> 01:57:44.503]  It won't lend for building the one kind of power stations that work in those countries, because they've got plenty of coal, and that's coal-fired power.
[01:57:44.803 --> 01:57:47.704]  Now, these days coal-fired power is clean, it's efficient,
[01:57:48.364 --> 01:57:53.290]  It's continuous, it's reliable, and yet the World Bank denies it.
[01:57:53.730 --> 01:57:54.171]  Result?
[01:57:54.571 --> 01:58:02.280]  People in Sub-Saharan Africa who don't have electricity die 15 to 20 years before those of us who do.
[01:58:03.027 --> 01:58:07.629]  So the death toll is already in the tens of millions every year.
[01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:18.135]  They're not killed by climate change, they're killed by climate change policies which, as Dr Frank's paper now proves, are completely unjustifiable.
[01:58:18.475 --> 01:58:23.978]  There is no existing case for doing anything about global warming at all.
[01:58:24.558 --> 01:58:25.600]  So that's the truth of it.
[01:58:25.861 --> 01:58:27.724]  They're already killing millions.
[01:58:28.084 --> 01:58:37.320]  And yes, if they were to get their way, the latest thing, there's an enormous campaign now worldwide, particularly on the BBC here, against eating meat.
[01:58:38.303 --> 01:58:51.156]  Now, as I know, because I was told I had diabetes two years ago, the cure for that is to stop eating bread and pasta and other carbohydrates and potatoes and rice and grains and eat lots of meat.
[01:58:51.716 --> 01:58:56.301]  And the reason why everybody's getting diabetes in the West is they're not eating enough meat.
[01:58:56.961 --> 01:59:00.923]  And yet here are these people who are already killing the people of Africa.
[01:59:01.223 --> 01:59:07.146]  Now they want to increase the death toll, which is already very high in the West, from diabetes and its complications.
[01:59:07.586 --> 01:59:12.169]  I no longer have diabetes because I now eat plenty of meat every day.
[01:59:12.449 --> 01:59:16.811]  That's how I cured myself and I am completely free of this disease.
[01:59:16.891 --> 01:59:25.395]  And by the way, genetically Hispanics and Native Americans particularly can't handle corn syrup or processed sugars even more than... Exactly that.
[01:59:25.795 --> 01:59:30.099]  And literally, you drive down the street at bus stops, you'll see folks with their legs chopped off.
[01:59:30.119 --> 01:59:31.180]  They're almost all Hispanic.
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:35.984]  And they'll admit that it's three times more likely in Hispanics to be killed by sugar.
[01:59:36.004 --> 01:59:37.545]  I mean, so sugar's deadly.
[01:59:37.625 --> 01:59:39.086]  It's really deadly for Hispanics.
[01:59:39.507 --> 01:59:44.091]  And the studies show they need high meat diets and not the sugar diets.
[01:59:44.471 --> 01:59:49.276]  The sugar, you see, it's also getting rid of the carbohydrates because they turn into sugar so quickly.
[01:59:49.296 --> 01:59:50.477]  It's the same eating sugar.
[01:59:50.757 --> 01:59:54.180]  And that's where the meat comes in, because it takes longer to digest.
[01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:55.802]  So you don't get the sugar rush.
[01:59:55.862 --> 01:59:59.425]  It doesn't overload your pancreas and you do away with the diabetes.
[01:59:59.805 --> 02:00:04.590]  So we've now got a new info war on our hands, Alex, which is to explain.
[02:00:05.070 --> 02:00:05.430]  I think so.
[02:00:23.823 --> 02:00:31.251]  The international communist left are determined to take away from our plates the roast beef of old England itself.
[02:00:31.532 --> 02:00:32.052]  And why?
[02:00:32.393 --> 02:00:34.235]  Because they want to kill us.
[02:00:34.655 --> 02:00:39.681]  One should never underestimate just how much communists and fascists hate humanity.
[02:00:39.821 --> 02:00:43.723]  Well, Christopher, they're now out in the open saying humans are bad, depopulate us.
[02:00:44.243 --> 02:00:50.745]  We've got the Democratic Party candidates for president coming out and saying depopulate, kill the brown people.
[02:00:51.066 --> 02:00:53.947]  I mean, we have Bernie Sanders saying it's about depopulation.
[02:00:53.987 --> 02:01:04.251]  Nothing could be more racialist than the current Democrat Party in its attitude to countries where what they need is our support.
[02:01:04.331 --> 02:01:06.612]  They do not need this kind of
[02:01:07.385 --> 02:01:15.307]  Naked racialism from the Democrats, who actually hate poor people, because they're all rich people now, the Democrats.
[02:01:15.587 --> 02:01:17.428]  They hate black people.
[02:01:17.868 --> 02:01:23.590]  They hate people who do not come from the privileged background in Greenwich Village that they come from.
[02:01:24.070 --> 02:01:32.732]  They want to rule by communism, by fascism, by one form or another of absolute totalitarian control.
[02:01:33.153 --> 02:01:34.413]  Well, I've got news for them.
[02:01:35.077 --> 02:01:41.587]  Democracy, which is what you and I believe in, Alex, that doesn't care what colour your skin is.
[02:01:41.907 --> 02:01:43.870]  It's one man, one vote.
[02:01:44.351 --> 02:01:46.353]  And everybody's vote is equal.
[02:01:46.373 --> 02:01:48.697]  There's nothing that's more of a leveller up.
[02:01:49.329 --> 02:01:49.649]  Yes, I think.
[02:02:05.632 --> 02:02:07.013]  Was that speech today.
[02:02:07.393 --> 02:02:11.717]  It's going to go down as one of the great speeches made by American presidents.
[02:02:12.137 --> 02:02:18.422]  It's going to be read and reread and studied and retweeted and passed on and commented on around the world.
[02:02:18.722 --> 02:02:24.827]  And the left are already not knowing where to look because they realize he has confronted them directly.
[02:02:24.847 --> 02:02:25.427]  That's your word.
[02:02:25.467 --> 02:02:26.528]  He's confronted them.
[02:02:26.828 --> 02:02:27.889]  He's faced them down.
[02:02:27.909 --> 02:02:33.494]  He said, no, we are not going to allow democracy to pass out into the night.
[02:02:33.754 --> 02:02:35.335]  We are not going to hand over.
[02:02:35.735 --> 02:02:50.607]  Our national rights and freedoms and independence and democracy and prosperity to an alien bureaucratic force, whether it's the United Nations, the World Bank or any of these others, we will be free and you will not be able to stop us.
[02:02:50.907 --> 02:02:54.330]  It was a great moment for America and a great moment for the world.
[02:02:55.913 --> 02:02:58.796]  You're absolutely right, and we really appreciate you.
[02:02:58.916 --> 02:03:01.659]  Whatsupwiththat.com is your main excellent site.
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:04.482]  Amazing information up there, and thank you for joining us.
[02:03:04.502 --> 02:03:05.363]  We look forward to speaking to you again.
[02:03:06.364 --> 02:03:06.965]  Thank you very much.
[02:03:06.985 --> 02:03:08.446]  God bless you, and God bless America.
[02:03:08.647 --> 02:03:09.047]  Thank you.
[02:03:09.428 --> 02:03:11.610]  Folks, I am just speechless right now.
[02:03:12.251 --> 02:03:17.977]  I was in a super bad mood today when I started talking about the Communist Chinese buying the Reddit.
[02:03:19.332 --> 02:03:21.873]  I already knew they'd done that and shutting down the Donald.
[02:03:22.373 --> 02:03:27.275]  But I just, I got reminded by it and got enraged on air and off air.
[02:03:27.895 --> 02:03:32.977]  But then I knew Trump gave this powerful speech, but it ended right when I went on air at 11am.
[02:03:33.217 --> 02:03:40.540]  So I started going through transcripts of it and saw articles on InfoWars and I watched a clip during the break and went into euphoria.
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:45.561]  Because I get mad at Trump not taking enough action because I know how serious this battle is.
[02:03:45.601 --> 02:03:47.342]  I love Trump, but I also get irritated.
[02:03:48.706 --> 02:03:50.228]  I know he does stuff when you put heat on him.
[02:03:50.748 --> 02:03:51.389]  He's a good guy.
[02:03:51.789 --> 02:03:59.076]  But man, him coming out and saying the globalists aren't going to run the world and you're a bunch of trash, and coming out against big tech at the UN, that is going to be all over the world.
[02:03:59.137 --> 02:04:00.478]  That means he's really taking action.
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:03.881]  So, I'm just really happy.
[02:04:03.921 --> 02:04:06.544]  So thank you, all of you that have made this show possible.
[02:04:06.564 --> 02:04:08.246]  Because let me tell you, if it wasn't for InfoWars,
[02:04:10.017 --> 02:04:17.879]  And folks like DrudgeReport.com and a few others, but you, the audience, I mean, you're the patriots that get the plan, that know about the diabolical plan.
[02:04:18.159 --> 02:04:20.419]  Nobody knew this stuff 10 years ago or 20 years ago.
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:24.520]  And I wasn't ever on air like going, yay, we know what nobody else does.
[02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:25.500]  I've been freaked out!
[02:04:26.361 --> 02:04:32.422]  Big private world government, anti-human, trying to break our families up, run by a bunch of pedophile devil worshipers.
[02:04:34.262 --> 02:04:36.443]  Put the floor out of the water to brain damage us on record?
[02:04:36.503 --> 02:04:37.503]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:04:38.433 --> 02:04:39.494]  I know why I sound crazy.
[02:04:39.674 --> 02:04:41.497]  I've kind of gone crazy knowing all this stuff.
[02:04:41.517 --> 02:04:44.079]  Because I'm pissed, man.
[02:04:44.119 --> 02:04:45.801]  I'm pissed at people taking this lying down.
[02:04:45.821 --> 02:04:47.083]  Myself included.
[02:04:47.884 --> 02:04:49.185]  I'm not taking it lying down!
[02:04:49.545 --> 02:04:49.786]  Ever!
[02:04:51.032 --> 02:04:52.272]  And I like seeing what Trump did.
[02:04:52.312 --> 02:04:53.493]  I want a pro-human future.
[02:04:54.173 --> 02:04:55.093]  These people are our enemies.
[02:04:55.113 --> 02:04:55.613]  He's globalist.
[02:04:55.633 --> 02:04:59.295]  And listen, we've got Black Friday comes two months early right now, running this week.
[02:04:59.535 --> 02:05:04.176]  Then fullwarestore.com, storewide free shipping, double patriot points, and 50% off all the supplements and preparedness goods.
[02:05:04.396 --> 02:05:05.757]  And man, these are amazing products.
[02:05:06.317 --> 02:05:12.339]  I mean, I can't tell you what taking fish oil and krill oil and a knockout every night our sleep aid does for my sleep.
[02:05:12.419 --> 02:05:13.139]  It's just incredible.
[02:05:13.499 --> 02:05:14.399]  Look at all the weight I've lost.
[02:05:14.439 --> 02:05:15.180]  I look a lot better.
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:19.401]  I've only been doing this a month religiously, taking the supplements, because I always forget to take them for a while, then get out of shape.
[02:05:20.225 --> 02:05:20.725]  It's amazing.
[02:05:21.205 --> 02:05:22.005]  Take advantage of these.
[02:05:22.065 --> 02:05:23.906]  Stock up on your Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.

[02:05:32.688 --> 02:05:33.068]  Seriously.
[02:05:33.248 --> 02:05:34.688]  We are the damn tip of the spear.
[02:05:34.808 --> 02:05:35.509]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:36.449 --> 02:05:38.969]  I can feel the globalists panicking.
[02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:41.030]  Did you see the video?
[02:05:41.070 --> 02:05:42.390]  We heard it like five times today.
[02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:44.491]  If you're a radio listener, it's on Infowars.com.
[02:05:44.531 --> 02:05:45.251]  I'm Greta Thunberg.
[02:05:46.514 --> 02:05:50.696]  And her Soros handler, it's on record, the guy's Lieutenant George Soros at the UN.
[02:05:51.316 --> 02:05:53.097]  And she's in there spouting into the world crap.
[02:05:54.297 --> 02:06:00.660]  And then struts in Trump and she just looks like a Grinch that stole Christmas about to have a heart attack.
[02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:02.201]  It's so archetypal.
[02:06:02.241 --> 02:06:03.261]  It's beyond any movie.
[02:06:03.481 --> 02:06:04.402]  It's beyond theater.
[02:06:04.442 --> 02:06:05.942]  It's the real world!
[02:06:07.803 --> 02:06:08.424]  Think about it.
[02:06:08.444 --> 02:06:09.844]  Think about how amazing it is.
[02:06:09.864 --> 02:06:13.746]  Think about how we are alive on this planet in this fantastical universe.
[02:06:15.336 --> 02:06:28.527]  Now, we've put together a few of the clubs, we'll have more of them in this hour, but you heard Lord Monckton earlier, and I agree with him, this is Trump's most powerful, most epic speech, that when you understand that the globalists used to want to have people arrested if they talked about this.
[02:06:28.547 --> 02:06:34.833]  I mean, they used to tell police in training manuals, we've shown you, that if people have get out of the UN stickers on their car, go ahead and arrest them.
[02:06:35.393 --> 02:06:36.975]  That was in law enforcement magazines.
[02:06:37.455 --> 02:06:38.676]  It all backfired!
[02:06:39.056 --> 02:06:45.281]  We believed in humanity, we exposed it, and now it's nationalism versus globalism.
[02:06:46.302 --> 02:06:47.903]  And you'll never have your world government.
[02:06:48.423 --> 02:06:49.544]  Ha ha ha!
[02:06:49.905 --> 02:06:52.126]  No matter how much tyranny, they're done!
[02:06:52.366 --> 02:06:52.967]  They're done!
[02:06:53.007 --> 02:06:53.848]  Let's go to these clips.
[02:06:55.309 --> 02:07:06.017]  Looking around and all over this large, magnificent planet, the truth is plain to see.
[02:07:07.403 --> 02:07:10.745]  If you want freedom, take pride in your country.
[02:07:12.026 --> 02:07:15.948]  If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty.
[02:07:17.009 --> 02:07:20.551]  And if you want peace, love your nation.
[02:07:22.312 --> 02:07:29.156]  Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first.
[02:07:30.377 --> 02:07:33.138]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[02:07:34.179 --> 02:07:36.080]  The future belongs to patriots.
[02:07:37.130 --> 02:07:51.135]  The future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors, and honor the differences that make each country special and unique.
[02:07:51.195 --> 02:08:00.118]  I recently met the CEO of a terrific American company, Micron Technology, at the White House.
[02:08:01.358 --> 02:08:05.860]  Micron produces memory chips used in countless electronics.
[02:08:07.153 --> 02:08:21.839]  To advance the Chinese government's five-year economic plan, a company owned by the Chinese state allegedly stole Micron's designs, valued at up to $8.7 billion.
[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:34.284]  Soon, the Chinese company obtains patents for nearly an identical product, and Micron was banned from selling its own goods in China.
[02:08:36.957 --> 02:08:38.258]  But we are seeking justice.
[02:08:39.239 --> 02:08:47.964]  The United States lost 60,000 factories after China entered the WTO.
[02:08:49.746 --> 02:08:53.628]  This is happening to other countries all over the globe.
[02:08:54.809 --> 02:08:58.772]  The World Trade Organization needs drastic change.
[02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:09.778]  The second largest economy in the world should not be permitted to declare itself a developing country in order to game the system at others' expense.
[02:09:10.639 --> 02:09:15.223]  We must always be skeptical of those who want conformity and control.
[02:09:16.665 --> 02:09:21.810]  Even in free nations, we see alarming signs and new challenges to liberty.
[02:09:23.070 --> 02:09:35.273]  A small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense power over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say.
[02:09:35.293 --> 02:09:45.296]  A permanent political class is openly disdainful, dismissive and defiant of the will of the people.
[02:09:46.436 --> 02:09:50.697]  A faceless bureaucracy operates in secret and weakens
[02:09:52.045 --> 02:09:52.665]  I'm in ecstasy.
[02:09:52.725 --> 02:09:54.826]  Stay there.
[02:09:54.846 --> 02:09:56.347]  We're gonna play all of it.
[02:09:56.387 --> 02:09:57.327]  O-Tip Jesus is joining us.
[02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:24.582]  Let me tell you, this is a big deal in front of the whole world, folks.
[02:10:24.602 --> 02:10:25.322]  This is a big deal.
[02:10:25.762 --> 02:10:35.587]  Alex Jones.
[02:10:35.667 --> 02:10:36.848]  He was a nice guy, actually.
[02:10:36.868 --> 02:10:37.288]  You like him?
[02:10:38.872 --> 02:10:39.913]  Oh, that's good.
[02:10:40.033 --> 02:10:40.633]  Alex Jones.
[02:10:40.713 --> 02:10:41.153]  Nice guy.
[02:10:41.534 --> 02:10:49.258]  I know now, from top people, that you actually are for real, and you understand you're in danger, and you understand what you're doing, is epic.
[02:10:49.298 --> 02:10:50.758]  Your reputation's amazing.
[02:10:50.778 --> 02:10:52.599]  I will not let you down.
[02:10:52.739 --> 02:10:55.601]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:10:56.181 --> 02:11:00.926]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be looking at me in a year and a year or two years.
[02:11:00.946 --> 02:11:03.649]  Let's give me a little bit of a time to run things.
[02:11:03.709 --> 02:11:08.093]  But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that interview.
[02:11:08.133 --> 02:11:10.135]  He said he was going to do it, and he did a great job.
[02:11:10.175 --> 02:11:11.536]  You'll be very proud of our country.
[02:11:11.596 --> 02:11:13.218]  So while we're there, you probably read it.
[02:11:13.278 --> 02:11:13.999]  It was in Drudge.
[02:11:14.519 --> 02:11:15.320]  Who's great, by the way.
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:16.601]  Drudge is amazing.
[02:11:17.262 --> 02:11:20.863]  But the story in Drudge and Big Story, it's all over the place now.
[02:11:21.544 --> 02:11:29.307]  Guys swimming across and big bags of stuff, shrugs, swimming across the river, right?
[02:11:29.987 --> 02:11:30.787]  Swimming right across.
[02:11:31.348 --> 02:11:33.088]  We just caught these guys coming across the border.
[02:11:33.709 --> 02:11:35.549]  They're jumping in, they just jumped in the rafts.
[02:11:35.569 --> 02:11:37.290]  They're coming up 1, 2, 3, 4.
[02:11:38.751 --> 02:11:39.791]  They have big satchels.
[02:11:40.729 --> 02:11:46.374]  And actually the camera crew, or the reporters, were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[02:11:47.135 --> 02:11:50.198]  Because they're showing this on camera, the guys carrying bags of stuff.
[02:11:50.258 --> 02:11:50.638]  It was drugs.
[02:11:50.658 --> 02:11:57.725]  Thank you.
[02:11:57.745 --> 02:12:00.167]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncripple America.
[02:12:00.207 --> 02:12:01.108]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:12:01.548 --> 02:12:03.350]  You will be attacked for coming on and we know you know that.
[02:12:03.390 --> 02:12:03.730]  Thank you.
[02:12:04.351 --> 02:12:04.912]  Thank you very much.
[02:12:06.113 --> 02:12:10.535]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:12:11.115 --> 02:12:12.615]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:12:15.917 --> 02:12:23.439]  Ladies and gentlemen, I started this broadcast out optimistic, but very, very upset.
[02:12:23.539 --> 02:12:32.683]  And it's a problem I have, that David Knight has, and that Owen Schroyer has, and I know that Will Johnson and Tom Pappard have, and that Savannah Hernandez has, and all our other hosts.
[02:12:33.618 --> 02:12:38.502]  When you look at this stuff, I mean, I do a lot of preparation at home and in the morning and when I get here.
[02:12:38.522 --> 02:12:42.685]  And it's upsetting.
[02:12:42.925 --> 02:12:44.126]  I mean, I'm not being a victim here.
[02:12:44.146 --> 02:12:56.394]  I'm just telling you that it's really upsetting to study the left because there's so much worse than I can even say.
[02:12:56.594 --> 02:13:01.018]  And at the end of the show, almost every day, the broadcast, I'll go through the papers
[02:13:02.110 --> 02:13:03.891]  And I'll go, oh man, I didn't cover that.
[02:13:04.051 --> 02:13:04.871]  I didn't cover this.
[02:13:04.891 --> 02:13:09.054]  And I feel guilty like I'm not doing a good enough job.
[02:13:09.974 --> 02:13:14.796]  And I think about people out there that don't care about humanity or society, who all think everything's a big joke.
[02:13:17.618 --> 02:13:18.638]  What must that be like?
[02:13:18.698 --> 02:13:21.600]  Because I'm fighting all the time, and I feel like I'm not doing enough.
[02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:25.282]  And it's not from some goody-two-shoes perspective.
[02:13:26.345 --> 02:13:27.146]  I'm not an evil person.
[02:13:27.166 --> 02:13:28.987]  I like to see people hurt for no reason.
[02:13:29.447 --> 02:13:31.409]  And I don't like to dominate people for no reason.
[02:13:31.929 --> 02:13:33.630]  And I don't want power for no reason.
[02:13:33.651 --> 02:13:35.172]  I wanted to protect myself.
[02:13:37.674 --> 02:13:38.934]  And I don't like seeing people poor.
[02:13:38.954 --> 02:13:40.896]  I don't like seeing animals hurt.
[02:13:42.837 --> 02:13:47.521]  But I have a instinctive territorialism.
[02:13:50.003 --> 02:13:51.224]  And I get enraged.
[02:13:53.533 --> 02:13:56.654]  A lot of people think, oh, you get mad, you get stupid.
[02:13:56.714 --> 02:13:57.694]  No, actually, you get scared.
[02:13:57.774 --> 02:13:58.314]  You can't think.
[02:13:58.794 --> 02:14:01.035]  No, when I'm angry, I can think real good.
[02:14:01.395 --> 02:14:05.876]  It's like a rushing of just all this information and everything's so clear when I'm in that state.
[02:14:07.576 --> 02:14:08.756]  And it's not a demonic anger.
[02:14:08.816 --> 02:14:11.317]  It's a human anger.
[02:14:11.357 --> 02:14:12.797]  I wouldn't even call it a godly anger.
[02:14:13.737 --> 02:14:17.418]  It's a human clarity and just focus.
[02:14:20.731 --> 02:14:26.134]  Because my very cells, it's, because you've got the spirit, that's God, and then that's your connection to God, your spirit.
[02:14:26.174 --> 02:14:27.695]  But the body has a life.
[02:14:27.775 --> 02:14:31.937]  The body, the cells, have a will to survive as well.
[02:14:33.038 --> 02:14:34.239]  They're a shadow of the spirit.
[02:14:35.019 --> 02:14:36.820]  And my body's like, this is the enemy!
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:38.621]  I mean, you want to hurt children?
[02:14:38.641 --> 02:14:40.402]  You want to destroy their innocence?
[02:14:40.502 --> 02:14:43.424]  My cells want to fight.
[02:14:45.267 --> 02:14:50.129]  My very sinews, my bones, want to run up against the enemy.
[02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:52.830]  My teeth want to sink into their flesh.
[02:14:54.151 --> 02:14:55.971]  I want to squeeze the life out of them.
[02:14:55.991 --> 02:14:59.453]  I want to watch the dim, evil light go out of their eyes.
[02:14:59.573 --> 02:15:08.637]  My hands are around their neck politically because they're hurting innocent people, and my very body wants them off the children, and it's willing to do anything to get them off.
[02:15:09.837 --> 02:15:10.317]  Anything.
[02:15:13.058 --> 02:15:14.159]  It doesn't hurt other innocents.
[02:15:15.845 --> 02:15:19.988]  But we're going to have to be very patient to get this job done.
[02:15:20.008 --> 02:15:24.612]  And I can tell you Trump has that same rage.
[02:15:24.632 --> 02:15:26.194]  Many other people have that same rage.
[02:15:30.057 --> 02:15:32.419]  But it's not the rage that's going to get us through this.
[02:15:32.499 --> 02:15:34.881]  It's going to be that quiet, determined focus.
[02:15:35.702 --> 02:15:38.144]  And we've got to get in that quiet, determined focus place.
[02:15:39.605 --> 02:15:41.647]  Or the anger is going to go sideways.
[02:15:42.702 --> 02:15:45.124]  On people we care about around us and is radioactive.
[02:15:45.985 --> 02:15:50.248]  So it's got to be a balance and I spend so much time trying to not get angry.
[02:15:52.269 --> 02:15:56.753]  Then I look at other people that let themselves just be trampled on constantly.
[02:15:56.773 --> 02:16:00.776]  And it's dangerous.
[02:16:05.740 --> 02:16:07.141]  And I watch the twisted
[02:16:13.696 --> 02:16:15.766]  Organize themselves into armies of evil.
[02:16:17.844 --> 02:16:28.151]  And then try to convince those of us that have a conscience that we need to bow down to them because they can point out a few problems we have or something our ancestors did and it needs to be rebuked.
[02:16:28.671 --> 02:16:29.732]  It needs to be shouted out.
[02:16:29.832 --> 02:16:30.933]  It needs to be blocked.
[02:16:31.513 --> 02:16:34.355]  That doesn't mean go out and bully them and go out and get in their face.
[02:16:35.016 --> 02:16:37.137]  That just means don't do business with them.
[02:16:37.798 --> 02:16:39.099]  And when you see them, let them know.
[02:16:39.359 --> 02:16:43.182]  And when they get in your business, look them right in the eye and say, you listen here.
[02:16:44.096 --> 02:16:53.221]  You know damn well, you're a control freak, that in these people, and hate civilization, and you're of your father, the devil, so in the name of Jesus Christ, get behind me, Satan.
[02:16:53.601 --> 02:17:04.768]  And let me tell you, I've been doing that now, when they come over and they go, F you, F your family, or shame on you, and they're all, and it's, I just go, you're of your father, the devil, in the name of Jesus Christ, get behind me, Satan.
[02:17:05.108 --> 02:17:06.048]  And they run.
[02:17:06.609 --> 02:17:08.050]  This happens routinely now.
[02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:09.931]  They start stumbling over themselves.
[02:17:09.951 --> 02:17:10.291]  They go,
[02:17:12.502 --> 02:17:13.782]  And I just... Because they know.
[02:17:13.882 --> 02:17:15.143]  It's like, they go, whoa!
[02:17:16.204 --> 02:17:21.186]  And it's that deed we have on this planet because of Christ.
[02:17:21.206 --> 02:17:22.547]  See, the devil was given this planet.
[02:17:23.528 --> 02:17:28.791]  But we are given the down payment on the deed if we simply take it.
[02:17:28.891 --> 02:17:34.534]  And it's our planet as a launch pad to infinite futures.
[02:17:35.895 --> 02:17:36.875]  And the system doesn't like that.
[02:17:37.536 --> 02:17:39.437]  Everything is about the end of the future.
[02:17:40.287 --> 02:17:48.574]  The end of civilization, the globalist singularity, humans fall away like rocket boosters on a space shuttle mission.
[02:17:49.254 --> 02:17:58.222]  And they control the future, and then we suck, and we're horrible, and we're bad, and it's all over for us, and it's all foregone conclusion, give up, lay down in the ditch, it's all over.
[02:17:58.702 --> 02:17:59.222]  No it's not.
[02:18:00.203 --> 02:18:04.267]  That's because those of you that chose Satan, it's all over for you!
[02:18:06.189 --> 02:18:07.690]  You're what's going to fall to the side.
[02:18:08.251 --> 02:18:08.791]  Not us!
[02:18:09.632 --> 02:18:10.893]  Every bit of its projection.
[02:18:11.313 --> 02:18:12.434]  Look at globalists.
[02:18:13.475 --> 02:18:15.396]  They could be worth a trillion dollars.
[02:18:15.456 --> 02:18:16.657]  Some of them control trillions.
[02:18:16.717 --> 02:18:19.139]  It's all made up, inflated crap anyways.
[02:18:20.941 --> 02:18:26.045]  And they look devoid of power, of regalness, of strength.
[02:18:27.321 --> 02:18:29.402]  Even though they have pretty bodies they've paid for.
[02:18:29.462 --> 02:18:30.963]  They look like mummies.
[02:18:31.403 --> 02:18:33.144]  Painted trollops.
[02:18:34.024 --> 02:18:35.945]  And they are soulless.
[02:18:36.145 --> 02:18:39.127]  And they are without any real direction.
[02:18:39.147 --> 02:18:41.568]  Let's see if we can get our guest on here.
[02:18:41.588 --> 02:18:43.109]  I want to get him on Hotel Jesus.
[02:18:43.149 --> 02:18:43.809]  We'll see if that happens.
[02:18:44.129 --> 02:18:45.730]  But regardless, I'm going to play some more of these clips.
[02:18:47.051 --> 02:18:48.532]  Mike Adams is going to be co-hosting tomorrow.
[02:18:48.992 --> 02:18:50.292]  Robert Barnes is going to be in the studio.
[02:18:53.524 --> 02:19:02.606]  We were going to file lawsuits two weeks ago, three weeks ago, but we've been waiting for the Attorney Generals to get theirs in place to make sure ours line up with what the White House is doing.
[02:19:02.826 --> 02:19:06.127]  But we're either filing them tomorrow or Thursday.
[02:19:07.687 --> 02:19:11.008]  We'll start filing them tomorrow, Thursday, and then there's going to be suits this week, next week, you name it.
[02:19:11.328 --> 02:19:15.169]  And I'm not happy about this, but it has to happen.
[02:19:15.969 --> 02:19:18.450]  And we're not filing lawsuits just to play games here.
[02:19:18.630 --> 02:19:20.050]  That's why we don't just file them right away.
[02:19:21.593 --> 02:19:23.614]  So, this is serious business.
[02:19:23.654 --> 02:19:25.955]  That's another reason to get the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:25.975 --> 02:19:26.476]  You wanna fight?
[02:19:26.496 --> 02:19:27.796]  You want somebody to fight?
[02:19:27.816 --> 02:19:29.677]  You're looking for somebody that ain't gonna back down?
[02:19:29.797 --> 02:19:31.378]  Oh, you found it right here, folks.
[02:19:31.958 --> 02:19:32.639]  This is a real deal.
[02:19:33.539 --> 02:19:43.404]  That's why they spend all day on the internet, from a Patriot perspective that's paid for, saying we're not real, saying we work for this or that or I'm Bill Hicks.
[02:19:43.645 --> 02:19:49.908]  All that crap is to tell you that the Bonafidi, the bones, the real McCoy isn't real.
[02:19:53.786 --> 02:19:54.347]  I'm for real.
[02:19:55.147 --> 02:19:55.848]  Trump's for real.
[02:19:55.868 --> 02:19:57.409]  This fight's for real.
[02:19:58.089 --> 02:19:58.810]  And you're for real.
[02:19:59.590 --> 02:20:01.512]  So stop worrying about all the naysayers.
[02:20:01.872 --> 02:20:03.793]  You've seen how far we've come against globalism.
[02:20:04.073 --> 02:20:10.838]  And you've seen it go from thinking it had total superiority and supremacy to now it's on its heels and fighting for its life.
[02:20:11.499 --> 02:20:14.461]  And it's had to take out the brass knuckles on us to try to win.
[02:20:14.481 --> 02:20:16.763]  And all that done is piss us off.
[02:20:17.932 --> 02:20:24.636]  That point where they hurt us, your brain just clicks on, you say, you're gonna get hurt real bad right now, and they get hurt real bad politically.
[02:20:26.757 --> 02:20:29.619]  We're still on air despite everything the enemies tried.
[02:20:30.139 --> 02:20:30.840]  Thanks to you.
[02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:32.281]  You're not an audience.
[02:20:33.221 --> 02:20:35.282]  You're the pro-human resistance to the globalists.
[02:20:36.163 --> 02:20:39.105]  You are amazing over the race, color, and creed across this planet.
[02:20:40.125 --> 02:20:42.087]  And you ain't seen nothing yet, as they say.
[02:20:43.015 --> 02:20:59.163]  Ladies and gentlemen, with Trump's epic speech that we're going to cover on The War Room today, the whole thing, more of it coming up next segment, saying globalism's dead, the tech censorship, we're coming for you, big tech's lost $56 billion in market cap just from that statement.
[02:20:59.603 --> 02:21:03.065]  Talk about Trump taking big Chai Com Tech to the woodshed.
[02:21:03.385 --> 02:21:04.886]  I wanted to get Hotep Jesus on today.
[02:21:04.946 --> 02:21:05.967]  He's hard to get on, he's a busy guy.
[02:21:06.567 --> 02:21:11.091]  We got him on, but he got a little bit late, so we already got in the wings, which is another person I want to get on today or tomorrow.
[02:21:11.491 --> 02:21:16.356]  Leo Zagami, who's an expert on the Vatican, and he's written an article at leozagami.com.
[02:21:16.736 --> 02:21:18.238]  It's also at infowars.com.
[02:21:19.599 --> 02:21:24.123]  Greta's parents reported to Child Services in Sweden this morning.
[02:21:25.024 --> 02:21:26.925]  Talk about an abused child, a brainwashed child.
[02:21:26.945 --> 02:21:32.610]  Surprise, Greta Thunberg's coach is a Soros, Bill and Melinda Gates operative.
[02:21:33.558 --> 02:21:34.678]  Well of course they are.
[02:21:34.698 --> 02:21:39.579]  And her security and the guy handling her at the UN is also that.
[02:21:39.619 --> 02:21:41.140]  And of course her parents are Antifa.
[02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:43.700]  So we're going to get Hotep Jesus' take on that.
[02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:50.742]  But I want to bring, and we'll go to Hotep in just a moment, I wanted to bring Leo Zegami in here, who's broken the snooze.
[02:21:51.382 --> 02:21:53.922]  Give us the latest intel on Greta.
[02:21:53.982 --> 02:21:56.003]  I mean she was like possessed by Hitler.
[02:21:56.423 --> 02:22:02.424]  When I say that, I mean she really had the wild-eyedness, that certain look, that certain
[02:22:04.335 --> 02:22:04.895]  Cadence?
[02:22:05.356 --> 02:22:07.557]  A lot of people are making the Hitler parallel right now.
[02:22:09.019 --> 02:22:30.715]  Yes Alex, I've been sincerely praying very much for Greta in the last 24 hours because the moment Trump crossed Greta, this demon came out of her and was visible in her eyes and it really broke my heart because this child is being not only abused as of course for propaganda reasons,
[02:22:31.135 --> 02:22:37.177]  But she obviously has some demon inside and it's becoming increasingly visible.
[02:22:37.537 --> 02:22:51.822]  So when earlier this morning, a friend from Stockholm contacted me sending me this news that the parents have been reported for child abuse and this report is being taken seriously.
[02:22:52.162 --> 02:23:07.270]  Well, in a way, Alex, I was really relieved because yesterday here on my own channel, I actually prayed for her and made the kind of like a liberation prayer because I felt really sorry for this person.
[02:23:07.530 --> 02:23:16.894]  He's like, I mean, the exorcist was a film in which you had the priest who was Mark Fonsito, who was a Swedish and a Jesuit with a with a
[02:23:20.516 --> 02:23:41.323]  And she is possessed, and there is no doubt on that, because when Trump, a man of God, who is about to talk about a subject like religious intolerance in a way nobody has done ever before, who has invested now $25 million talking about the fact that Christians are being killed, Jews are being killed, Muslims
[02:23:43.904 --> 02:23:47.185]  Religious intolerance has to end.
[02:23:47.225 --> 02:23:54.369]  And instead, we are talking here about the rubbish that Greta was pushing through with their propaganda.
[02:23:54.609 --> 02:24:04.393]  And of course, at one point when she went on stage, it was visible to the whole world and even to the child services in Sweden who are taking this report very seriously.
[02:24:04.713 --> 02:24:09.395]  So I expect the parents of Greta to have some big problems on their return to Sweden.
[02:24:10.185 --> 02:24:12.666]  Because they're just passing her around to the globalists everywhere.
[02:24:12.686 --> 02:24:13.826]  She's clearly totally brainwashed.
[02:24:14.146 --> 02:24:20.088]  Hotep Jesus has been marketing for many decades, both traditional and digital spheres.
[02:24:20.128 --> 02:24:20.728]  Very well known.
[02:24:20.748 --> 02:24:22.949]  He's a natural teacher and a wealth of knowledge.
[02:24:23.369 --> 02:24:25.409]  He's a popular radio and TV show.
[02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:26.430]  He's a huge guest.
[02:24:26.850 --> 02:24:27.510]  Everybody knows that.
[02:24:27.550 --> 02:24:33.772]  He's also known for his work with Curtis 50 Cent Jackson and the regional marketing director for his incubator program.
[02:24:33.792 --> 02:24:38.633]  In addition, he's doing work in Sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania, where he keeps in contact
[02:24:39.133 --> 02:24:44.095]  What do you make of Greta Thunberg, Trump's speech at the UN, just the climate we're in right now, the energy level.
[02:24:44.115 --> 02:24:44.915]  I can feel the energy.
[02:24:44.935 --> 02:24:45.376]  Do you feel that?
[02:25:08.490 --> 02:25:11.931]  Leo, Leo made me laugh when he said she was possessed.
[02:25:12.051 --> 02:25:20.493]  I was like, yo, that kind of goes in line with what I was thinking, because when I first saw Greta, I thought of the Chucky dog, right?
[02:25:20.593 --> 02:25:25.194]  So everybody's saying, oh, you know, you can't talk about this little kid and that and dirt.
[02:25:25.374 --> 02:25:34.757]  I said to myself, I said, if the Chucky dog, if the Chucky dog was running after you with a knife in his hand, would you punch the little thing or would you feel bad?
[02:25:36.636 --> 02:25:40.218]  You know, so with Greta, I'm like, I see Chucky.
[02:25:40.599 --> 02:25:44.921]  I see somebody that I really don't care what their age is, you know?
[02:25:44.941 --> 02:25:46.242]  If you, once you enter
[02:25:48.078 --> 02:25:53.962]  The, uh, the conversation and you put yourself in the front, you gotta be able to take some bullets, right?
[02:25:54.002 --> 02:25:55.442]  You gotta be able to take some criticism.
[02:25:56.023 --> 02:25:56.843]  There she is right there.
[02:25:56.863 --> 02:25:57.404]  That's Greta.
[02:25:57.464 --> 02:25:58.804]  To me, that's what I see.
[02:25:59.125 --> 02:25:59.925]  I see- No, you're right.
[02:26:00.045 --> 02:26:01.066]  I was calling her the Grinch.
[02:26:01.106 --> 02:26:02.266]  She looks more like Chucky.
[02:26:03.327 --> 02:26:03.787]  You see that?
[02:26:04.088 --> 02:26:04.668]  You see that?
[02:26:04.688 --> 02:26:09.751]  Like, like, this is not- And it's- The sad part is- And Chucky says, Chucky goes, I'm watching you.
[02:26:09.791 --> 02:26:10.351]  And she says that.
[02:26:10.611 --> 02:26:14.514]  I am watching- She's like, she's like the German- She's like a- She's like Hitler meets Chucky.
[02:26:15.516 --> 02:26:18.738]  Yeah, and you know, it's a fraud.
[02:26:18.778 --> 02:26:24.882]  It's a facade because she gets into character when she did that little speak, right?
[02:26:24.902 --> 02:26:28.204]  And I think her dad was actor or his mom or something like that.
[02:26:28.464 --> 02:26:31.666]  This little girl is being propped up to push an agenda.
[02:26:31.906 --> 02:26:39.490]  Scott Pressler has done more for the climate in two days than her entire movement will ever do.
[02:26:41.431 --> 02:26:43.553]  This is the type of situation where we have to
[02:26:44.582 --> 02:26:48.686]  Allow capitalists, so-called capitalists, to handle the climate problem.
[02:26:48.766 --> 02:26:52.790]  Don't let the socialists handle the problem, because the problem won't get solved, but it'll get worse.
[02:26:53.430 --> 02:27:05.522]  You have private corporations right now that have invented machines or ideas that are cleaning up garbage from the ocean.
[02:27:06.368 --> 02:27:08.370]  People are going to be able to solve these problems.
[02:27:08.690 --> 02:27:11.312]  And then what's the first thing that these climate people do?
[02:27:11.712 --> 02:27:13.113]  They shut down biotech.
[02:27:13.133 --> 02:27:17.477]  They say, oh, we don't want to deal with, you know, the tech people that want to help with this issue.
[02:27:18.037 --> 02:27:22.260]  Well, how else do you clean up stuff without technology?
[02:27:22.581 --> 02:27:25.503]  At one point, the garbage truck was technology.
[02:27:25.523 --> 02:27:28.666]  Then the garbage truck had arms and picked up your garbage.
[02:27:28.706 --> 02:27:30.127]  The guy didn't have to get outside the truck.
[02:27:30.367 --> 02:27:32.388]  Technology is always going to be around.
[02:27:32.448 --> 02:27:35.531]  So technology is going to have to help us clean up this mess.
[02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:39.371]  And the first thing you want to do is attack the technology.
[02:27:39.411 --> 02:27:39.911]  Well, you're right.
[02:27:39.931 --> 02:27:43.172]  They want to be able to decide what technology we can have and be the new kings of the earth.
[02:27:44.253 --> 02:27:44.513]  Right.
[02:27:44.753 --> 02:27:46.193]  And they don't want to create solutions.
[02:27:46.233 --> 02:27:48.934]  They don't want things to get better because then they're out of a job.
[02:27:49.294 --> 02:27:51.695]  I was about to say, why are they so anti-success?
[02:27:51.715 --> 02:27:55.736]  Because the left admits now, and the whole environmental movement is about an anti-human future.
[02:27:55.756 --> 02:27:56.936]  It's just a nightmare.
[02:27:56.956 --> 02:27:57.717]  We're all going to die.
[02:27:57.757 --> 02:27:58.377]  It all sucks.
[02:27:59.642 --> 02:28:03.466]  I mean, if you're a garbageman and there's no garbage, you're out of business.
[02:28:03.806 --> 02:28:06.649]  If you're an activist and there's no problems, you're out of business.
[02:28:06.789 --> 02:28:09.212]  And these people are making a lot of money as activists.
[02:28:09.712 --> 02:28:14.237]  So the only thing they can do is, after a problem's solved, is create a new problem.
[02:28:14.297 --> 02:28:17.120]  That's what socialists specialize in, creating problems out of thin air.
[02:28:18.106 --> 02:28:23.348]  Alright, I'm going to ask you, Hotep, we're going to break, what you want to get into, because you've always got a lot of really cool stuff on your radar.
[02:28:23.368 --> 02:28:30.011]  We're going to come back real fast and finish up with Leo Zegami, who I appreciate coming on on short notice, because he broke this story as we learn more developments.
[02:28:30.031 --> 02:28:35.853]  We'll be right back on the other side, but Hotep, I know you also have some websites, not just on Twitter.
[02:28:36.133 --> 02:28:38.214]  I'm always pushing people away from those big platforms.
[02:28:38.574 --> 02:28:40.155]  Where else can we find Hotep Planet?
[02:28:41.643 --> 02:28:43.885]  HotepNation.com is the best place.
[02:28:44.385 --> 02:28:46.567]  You'll get an idea of our philosophy.
[02:28:46.807 --> 02:28:47.868]  Some people think it's a religion.
[02:28:47.908 --> 02:28:48.749]  It's not a religion.
[02:28:49.149 --> 02:28:51.011]  It's an ideology or philosophy.
[02:28:51.431 --> 02:28:53.833]  So if you go to HotepNation.com and just read the op-ed.
[02:28:53.853 --> 02:28:55.194]  You also saw a book, Dominate Twitter.
[02:28:55.234 --> 02:28:58.737]  Alright, we'll be back with Hotep Jesus, Leo Zoghami, and Alex Jones.
[02:28:58.777 --> 02:29:00.138]  Now that's three weirdos!
[02:29:02.162 --> 02:29:03.082]  What a crazy time.
[02:29:03.142 --> 02:29:09.365]  Ho-Temp Jesus is our guest here, one of the great top marketers, expert on Twitter, but a really smart guy about the New World Order.
[02:29:09.385 --> 02:29:16.267]  And Leo Zagami, best-selling author, Vatican expert, and so much more, who we got on because he had a breaking story at leozagami.com.
[02:29:16.287 --> 02:29:18.008]  Leo, I want to get you back on soon.
[02:29:18.028 --> 02:29:19.268]  Thanks for popping in on short notice.
[02:29:19.308 --> 02:29:22.029]  What else would you like to talk about that's happening in the world right now?
[02:29:22.927 --> 02:29:33.349]  Well, I would like to conclude that regarding greater the fact that she has Asperger's syndrome and this has been proven by exorcist in the past to lead to demonic possession.
[02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:41.611]  So I respect totally what your guest is saying and giving, of course, the more materialistic view of how she's being used and abused.
[02:29:41.991 --> 02:29:45.632]  But there is also a spiritual problem here and it needs to be
[02:29:48.593 --> 02:29:49.854]  Is demonically possessed.
[02:29:49.994 --> 02:29:52.616]  And demonic possession is a very serious issue.
[02:29:52.656 --> 02:29:57.298]  So thank you for having me on and giving me the possibility to break this to all our viewers.
[02:29:57.518 --> 02:30:01.040]  Well as it unfolds, the story you're breaking, the CPS has sent to our house.
[02:30:01.401 --> 02:30:02.561]  Please join us again in the next few days.
[02:30:02.621 --> 02:30:03.102]  Thank you, Leo.
[02:30:03.122 --> 02:30:04.462]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:30:04.603 --> 02:30:04.943]  God bless.
[02:30:05.523 --> 02:30:08.125]  Hotep, we're three years into Trump and change.
[02:30:08.805 --> 02:30:09.646]  The world's crazy.
[02:30:09.666 --> 02:30:16.670]  We've got the Republican rival governor of Massachusetts, Bill Weld, saying we need to execute Trump.
[02:30:17.412 --> 02:30:19.293]  Stuff is really starting to get crazy.
[02:30:20.074 --> 02:30:28.198]  What would you call the climate the planet's in right now, with all these wars, rumors of wars, massive change, AI, quantum computing?
[02:30:29.279 --> 02:30:30.339]  What would you call this period?
[02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:34.001]  Oh man, what would you call it?
[02:30:34.021 --> 02:30:35.262]  That's a great question.
[02:30:35.302 --> 02:30:36.643]  It's definitely a turning point, right?
[02:30:36.723 --> 02:30:45.608]  We're at that... We're at a fork in the road right now, where we can, we can rescue America.
[02:30:46.684 --> 02:30:54.947]  But if it doesn't happen within the next few years, we're going to find out that people are going to be showing up at CPAC announcing their pronouns.
[02:30:55.488 --> 02:30:56.468]  That's what we're headed for.
[02:30:57.448 --> 02:31:06.612]  We're headed for a future where conservative influencers have pushed the right so far left that the right is now the left.
[02:31:07.441 --> 02:31:09.902]  We've got to be very careful with who we associate with.
[02:31:10.002 --> 02:31:12.322]  We have to be very careful with who we give a microphone to.
[02:31:12.622 --> 02:31:15.203]  I think we need to remove kids from politics, period.
[02:31:15.263 --> 02:31:18.844]  If you don't pay taxes, if you don't have kids, you should be ignored.
[02:31:18.964 --> 02:31:20.564]  We should not be exalting these kids.
[02:31:20.584 --> 02:31:25.306]  They should not have millions of followers on Twitter, thousands of followers on Twitter, because they have some opinions.
[02:31:25.626 --> 02:31:30.347]  Because the first thing they do is, when you criticize them, they're going to say, oh, wait, I'm a kid.
[02:31:30.867 --> 02:31:34.308]  So basically what they want is, they want all the perks of being an adult,
[02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:36.620]  With none of the drawbacks.
[02:31:36.881 --> 02:31:37.741]  With none of the cons.
[02:31:38.261 --> 02:31:38.461]  No.
[02:31:38.741 --> 02:31:40.622]  You either get everything, or you get nothing.
[02:31:40.802 --> 02:31:44.783]  So I say, because they're going to pull this young kid thing, that they should all be ignored.
[02:31:44.983 --> 02:31:46.043]  They should not be used.
[02:31:46.484 --> 02:31:47.684]  They should not be given a platform.
[02:31:47.724 --> 02:31:50.345]  I wouldn't interview anybody who is under the age of 18.
[02:31:50.425 --> 02:31:52.105]  I would not let them on my platform.
[02:31:52.265 --> 02:31:52.465]  No.
[02:31:52.626 --> 02:31:54.106]  Go grow up, then you come back.
[02:31:54.286 --> 02:31:54.506]  Right?
[02:31:55.046 --> 02:31:57.147]  Because it's too dangerous.
[02:31:57.727 --> 02:31:59.068]  You're not experienced enough.
[02:31:59.208 --> 02:32:00.908]  You're not, you have enough staying in the game.
[02:32:00.928 --> 02:32:01.968]  You've never paid taxes.
[02:32:02.229 --> 02:32:03.529]  You've never paid corporate taxes.
[02:32:04.560 --> 02:32:07.883]  I can't trust you to make the right decisions for America.
[02:32:07.903 --> 02:32:09.144]  I can't trust your opinion.
[02:32:09.164 --> 02:32:10.004]  It's not based on anything.
[02:32:10.404 --> 02:32:11.505]  You don't have kids.
[02:32:11.986 --> 02:32:14.768]  Well, you don't have a stake in the future of America.
[02:32:15.108 --> 02:32:16.249]  When you're gone, that's it.
[02:32:16.589 --> 02:32:17.690]  There's nothing left of you.
[02:32:18.290 --> 02:32:20.152]  So I think we need to do that.
[02:32:20.312 --> 02:32:22.874]  I'm also questioning repeal of the 19th.
[02:32:23.534 --> 02:32:24.675]  Women are way too emotional.
[02:32:25.036 --> 02:32:29.439]  I think until women learn to control their emotions,
[02:32:30.290 --> 02:32:33.291]  They should not be given a platform, they should not be given a microphone.
[02:32:33.752 --> 02:32:37.073]  Because these people are the same ones that socialists use.
[02:32:37.273 --> 02:32:42.335]  Socialists and communists use women, and they use children to push their agenda.
[02:32:42.816 --> 02:32:57.062]  Which is why we have to remove these people from the spotlight and bring it back to the male, the head of the household, and let us handle some of these things, and let women handle the womanly things, and let kids be kids.
[02:32:57.738 --> 02:33:01.116]  And grow up and learn how to be a man and learn how to be a woman.
[02:33:02.623 --> 02:33:04.003]  Right now, it's time for the men.
[02:33:04.203 --> 02:33:06.444]  The men that want to change America.
[02:33:06.464 --> 02:33:13.045]  It's time for the men to step up and be strong voices and stand up for the principles they believe in and speak up.
[02:33:13.485 --> 02:33:17.206]  If you don't like something within the conservative movement, we can't be trying to budge.
[02:33:17.226 --> 02:33:21.887]  We can't be trying to make the left like us or, oh, we can't do this, so fuck them.
[02:33:22.187 --> 02:33:23.427]  You know what I mean?
[02:33:23.747 --> 02:33:25.628]  You saw what they did to Alex Jones, right?
[02:33:25.808 --> 02:33:27.868]  They banned Alex Jones from the internet.
[02:33:28.088 --> 02:33:30.149]  That lets you know right now it's cold red.
[02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:32.229]  There's no time to be pussyfooting.
[02:33:32.948 --> 02:33:34.510]  They did this right before elections.
[02:33:34.530 --> 02:33:35.430]  This is election meddling.
[02:33:35.911 --> 02:33:39.814]  Now's the time where the men gotta step up, and the women gotta support the men.
[02:33:40.775 --> 02:33:42.196]  We gotta support the real men.
[02:33:42.577 --> 02:33:48.822]  Well, what you bring up gets a lot of attention, but Hitler did say, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[02:33:49.283 --> 02:33:51.765]  It is a fact that 80% of advertising targets women.
[02:33:52.285 --> 02:33:59.532]  And I can get emotional about once I've made a decision on something to drive me, but what happens is, on average, women are more collective.
[02:34:00.012 --> 02:34:13.682]  And they want to work with people and they tend to historically get fooled by authoritarians like Hitler's biggest supporters were women and I'm not saying women I don't think I'm going as far as you are obviously but the issue here is is that
[02:34:14.537 --> 02:34:16.699]  We have a egalitarian, open, liberal society.
[02:34:17.019 --> 02:34:18.461]  The West empowers women.
[02:34:19.081 --> 02:34:30.812]  And then it is statistically, at the big tech companies everywhere, and the Communist Chinese are hiring women now, who statistically will carry out authoritarianism in the name of everyone being nice and good, like the head of YouTube.
[02:34:30.852 --> 02:34:31.573]  And so men...
[02:34:32.173 --> 02:34:33.934]  Then they're saying men are bad.
[02:34:35.355 --> 02:34:36.856]  Oh my gosh, look at barstool sports.
[02:34:36.936 --> 02:34:37.836]  Men are being masculine.
[02:34:38.076 --> 02:34:39.877]  Now they're saying we can't be masculine.
[02:34:40.277 --> 02:34:42.119]  So they're saying we can't vote, basically.
[02:34:42.179 --> 02:34:43.199]  We can't have websites.
[02:34:43.539 --> 02:34:44.680]  We can't be heard from.
[02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:48.122]  And so what's happening is we expand and open up the freedom.
[02:34:48.382 --> 02:34:50.303]  And then we're being told now our freedom goes away.
[02:34:50.643 --> 02:34:53.705]  So the pushback is obviously where you're going with that.
[02:34:54.105 --> 02:34:59.028]  And it really shows the authoritarianism that the globalists do not want any leadership to fight a takeover.
[02:34:59.968 --> 02:35:02.470]  Anytime an authoritarian takes over, he enslaves or kills the men.
[02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:05.251]  And so we have culturally killed men for this takeover.
[02:35:05.291 --> 02:35:13.896]  It's like LBJ said, his letters are public, I'll have the effing N-words, you know, voting Democrat, for a hundred years.
[02:35:13.916 --> 02:35:16.598]  And he said, we're going to pay women to not have men in the house.
[02:35:17.078 --> 02:35:19.019]  And so it's, it's, it, that is their plan.
[02:35:19.239 --> 02:35:23.101]  Not blaming women, evil men come in and literally try to remove men.
[02:35:23.161 --> 02:35:24.022]  I mean, it's a fact.
[02:35:24.878 --> 02:35:28.119]  Yeah, I saw somebody the other day, they said it so clear.
[02:35:28.139 --> 02:35:32.540]  They said men are capitalists, and I hate that term, and women are communists.
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:39.442]  And it's true, which is why they're so susceptible to socialism and communism, and they love it so much.
[02:35:39.862 --> 02:35:45.644]  But that just points to their nature, that they belong in the community, the commune.
[02:35:45.844 --> 02:35:47.024]  That's where women belong.
[02:35:47.444 --> 02:35:50.525]  You stay in the community, we're going to go out and fight the battles.
[02:35:51.225 --> 02:35:54.066]  Today, the battles are more like a court war than a real war.
[02:35:54.764 --> 02:35:55.004]  Right?
[02:35:55.365 --> 02:35:57.448]  That we're facing here in America, at least.
[02:35:57.748 --> 02:36:00.211]  The women, we need to get back in the kitchen.
[02:36:00.231 --> 02:36:03.896]  We need to make sure that, you know, my sandwich is ready so I can go fight the war.
[02:36:03.916 --> 02:36:06.820]  We need to make sure that these kids know what gender they are.
[02:36:07.628 --> 02:36:08.088]  You know what I mean?
[02:36:08.168 --> 02:36:12.590]  Once you got the mom removed, now that this... I don't know where they're learning this gender stuff from.
[02:36:12.610 --> 02:36:12.870]  For sure.
[02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:18.073]  No one can deny that the family's been broken up so they can go sterilize the kids and end humanity.
[02:36:18.273 --> 02:36:19.033]  I mean, it's true.
[02:36:19.053 --> 02:36:22.034]  They're killing the way humans operate to come in and replace us.
[02:36:22.394 --> 02:36:24.976]  And so, in the name of freedom, it's a post-human world.
[02:36:25.036 --> 02:36:25.616]  Everybody's dead.
[02:36:26.938 --> 02:36:28.538]  I mean, look at the conservative movement.
[02:36:29.019 --> 02:36:31.419]  You got trans people in the conservative movement.
[02:36:31.739 --> 02:36:33.680]  What is conservative about being trans?
[02:36:33.700 --> 02:36:35.400]  I ain't got no problem with trans people.
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:37.381]  If that's what you want to do, that's what you want to do.
[02:36:37.901 --> 02:36:38.761]  But that's trans.
[02:36:38.801 --> 02:36:40.041]  That's not conservative.
[02:36:40.421 --> 02:36:48.023]  And people actually got these people out here pushing the conservative movement.
[02:36:48.163 --> 02:36:50.684]  They're giving them the baton.
[02:36:50.764 --> 02:36:53.644]  You have gay people that are in the conservative movement.
[02:36:53.664 --> 02:36:55.685]  There's nothing gay in the Bible.
[02:36:56.596 --> 02:36:58.898]  And conservative movement is very much so Christian.
[02:36:58.918 --> 02:37:00.418]  I ain't got no problem with gay people.
[02:37:00.478 --> 02:37:01.339]  I love gay people.
[02:37:01.359 --> 02:37:02.180]  I got gay friends.
[02:37:02.540 --> 02:37:03.680]  But that's not conservative.
[02:37:03.700 --> 02:37:04.281]  That's gay.
[02:37:04.601 --> 02:37:06.162]  That's not part of conservative movement.
[02:37:06.502 --> 02:37:18.550]  So the more the conservative movement, and I don't agree with everything in conservative movement, but when I see something that's compromising its principles, whether I agree with it or not, if you're compromising your principles, you're going to compromise your whole entire foundation.
[02:37:18.570 --> 02:37:20.371]  Well, Paul watched the video two weeks ago, and I should have aired it.
[02:37:20.970 --> 02:37:22.411]  I forgot the name of it, but it was really good.
[02:37:22.452 --> 02:37:31.300]  He was saying that the conservatives aren't conservatives anymore, they're just... I mean, the Democratic Party officially is endorsing pedophilia now.
[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:32.201]  Yeah!
[02:37:32.261 --> 02:37:32.742]  It's crazy.
[02:37:34.023 --> 02:37:36.426]  Yeah, that's where the pedophilia is, as it's always been.
[02:37:36.506 --> 02:37:38.448]  Ask Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
[02:37:38.868 --> 02:37:39.749]  It's all in his book.
[02:37:40.481 --> 02:37:43.164]  Who's perpetrating the trafficking of children?
[02:37:43.424 --> 02:37:50.471]  Go look at Tammany Hall, I believe, early 20th century, when they were trafficking women in New York City.
[02:37:50.571 --> 02:37:53.714]  Type of Tammany Hall, women trafficked New York City.
[02:37:53.734 --> 02:37:55.375]  20,000 was in that ring.
[02:37:55.655 --> 02:37:56.576]  Democrat city.
[02:37:58.058 --> 02:37:58.899]  Bruh, listen.
[02:37:58.919 --> 02:38:00.580]  The Democrats literally are Satanists.
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:03.663]  I mean, the Republicans got their own... The Democrats are Satanists, folks.
[02:38:03.863 --> 02:38:04.364]  We'll be right back.
[02:38:06.291 --> 02:38:07.452]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:07.492 --> 02:38:08.933]  Hotep Jesus is our guest.
[02:38:08.953 --> 02:38:13.015]  When this show ends, in about 13 minutes, the war room starts with Owen Schroyer.
[02:38:13.416 --> 02:38:19.300]  And I gotta tell ya, he's gonna be airing large segments of Trump's speech that was incredibly good.
[02:38:19.820 --> 02:38:20.701]  Threw down the gauntlet.
[02:38:20.901 --> 02:38:22.122]  Christopher Monckton was on earlier.
[02:38:22.402 --> 02:38:24.923]  He said it's the best speech he's ever seen, not just by Trump.
[02:38:25.324 --> 02:38:29.547]  I mean, what he said was a declaration of war on everything the globalists stand for.
[02:38:29.567 --> 02:38:31.528]  And they're gonna go completely ape now.
[02:38:31.908 --> 02:38:34.810]  Now, Hotep Jesus is here with us, laying out some really heavy stuff.
[02:38:34.830 --> 02:38:35.931]  And I'll say this about what he said.
[02:38:36.411 --> 02:38:42.575]  We're already in a period of humans being taken out of their natural form and natural roles.
[02:38:43.036 --> 02:38:47.259]  Doesn't mean people don't do the other roles sometimes, but people forcing the roles that are not natural.
[02:38:47.339 --> 02:38:50.001]  And now they're going to end humanity as we know it, in the family.
[02:38:50.021 --> 02:38:50.941]  That's the admitted goal.
[02:38:50.961 --> 02:38:51.782]  They're now announcing it.
[02:38:52.362 --> 02:38:59.827]  And so you can look at what he's saying is extreme, but the extreme openness and freedom of the West allowed all these things that were not natural.
[02:39:00.188 --> 02:39:03.270]  And then now it's being directed to end the ability to be natural.
[02:39:03.630 --> 02:39:07.051]  So now, anything upright, organic, authentic is under attack.
[02:39:07.091 --> 02:39:09.212]  Anything false is held up and worshipped.
[02:39:09.472 --> 02:39:12.173]  So I agree with him in the spectrum from which he speaks.
[02:39:13.093 --> 02:39:18.455]  But there have always been people in groups that are from orthodoxies that then go into other areas naturally.
[02:39:18.855 --> 02:39:20.136]  Yeah, so we're in the era of the solid majority.
[02:39:20.156 --> 02:39:21.676]  We are at the whim of the solid majority.
[02:39:21.996 --> 02:39:24.958]  If the solid majority doesn't get their ish together,
[02:39:49.401 --> 02:39:50.221]  We're in trouble.
[02:39:50.741 --> 02:39:53.382]  The silent majority has to cease being silent.
[02:39:53.622 --> 02:39:56.122]  We saw the silent majority show up at the polls for Trump.
[02:39:56.762 --> 02:39:58.903]  We see them show up at the Trump rallies.
[02:39:59.923 --> 02:40:05.004]  But if people don't start speaking up, you're basically consenting to the evil that's about to take over the world.
[02:40:06.344 --> 02:40:09.265]  So that's why I call this the era of the silent majority.
[02:40:09.305 --> 02:40:09.845]  It's on you.
[02:40:09.925 --> 02:40:11.125]  It's not on people like me.
[02:40:12.045 --> 02:40:17.286]  My only job is, and Alex's only job, and Rex Jones' only job is,
[02:40:17.978 --> 02:40:22.041]  It's to put the battery in your back, to make you not be afraid to come out and speak.
[02:40:22.081 --> 02:40:23.822]  We're showing you, you can be brave.
[02:40:23.862 --> 02:40:26.804]  You don't have to be afraid to speak your mind.
[02:40:27.184 --> 02:40:31.007]  You know, grab your cojones, make sure you're still a man and speak up.
[02:40:32.228 --> 02:40:34.709]  Stop being afraid of losing your job.
[02:40:35.070 --> 02:40:36.410]  Because here's the fact of the matter.
[02:40:36.791 --> 02:40:40.073]  If you lose your job, take the money you got and sue them.
[02:40:41.696 --> 02:40:47.419]  You should be happy if you get fired for something that happened on your Twitter.
[02:40:47.439 --> 02:40:49.720]  You should be happy, because that's the lawful way to happen.
[02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:50.781]  Now you never got to work again.
[02:40:50.801 --> 02:40:52.261]  Get the million-dollar check and go home.
[02:40:52.642 --> 02:41:00.005]  But it's a violation of your rights as an American, and we keep allowing these socialists and communists
[02:41:00.405 --> 02:41:05.527]  Just tear down the Constitution and just amend it, and amend it, and amend it, and amend it.
[02:41:06.007 --> 02:41:08.607]  So it's just not the same thing anymore.
[02:41:08.647 --> 02:41:10.308]  So it's no longer the Bill of Rights.
[02:41:10.488 --> 02:41:15.749]  Now it's just conglomerate foolery, you know?
[02:41:17.230 --> 02:41:20.151]  Also, you know, HOTEF Nation, we have Ten Commandments, right?
[02:41:20.211 --> 02:41:21.771]  And these are the Ten Commandments we follow.
[02:41:22.811 --> 02:41:28.193]  I think it's high time conservatives need to sit down at the table and figure out what are the principles they stand on
[02:41:29.223 --> 02:41:33.127]  You know, because when you look back, you're going to wonder what happened to conservatism.
[02:41:33.407 --> 02:41:36.130]  You know, how did it get this far?
[02:41:36.170 --> 02:41:38.973]  Michael Malice says conservatism is liberalism.
[02:41:39.033 --> 02:41:42.716]  By the way, your logo is kick ass.
[02:41:42.957 --> 02:41:43.597]  Make me one.
[02:41:45.039 --> 02:41:45.319]  Thanks.
[02:41:45.539 --> 02:41:46.200]  I thought of that.
[02:41:47.795 --> 02:41:48.975]  I envisioned it in my head.
[02:41:49.075 --> 02:41:49.996]  I gave it to somebody.
[02:41:51.257 --> 02:41:53.779]  I had dozens of people that could not get it right.
[02:41:54.259 --> 02:41:59.542]  You know, I think 200 designs were delivered and that one finally came and I was like, that's the one.
[02:41:59.562 --> 02:42:01.424]  That's exactly how I want it.
[02:42:01.464 --> 02:42:03.625]  Because I've been thinking about trying to come up with a logo for M4.
[02:42:03.725 --> 02:42:04.986]  It's like a shield or something.
[02:42:05.006 --> 02:42:09.049]  And I thought about it kind of like a tower, but I just can't ever come up with that.
[02:42:09.389 --> 02:42:10.690]  That is the best logo I've ever seen.
[02:42:11.758 --> 02:42:18.543]  Yeah, you know, Hotep Nation, we are in marketing and business, so, you know, maybe we can ideate something for him for Wars.
[02:42:18.563 --> 02:42:19.363]  Let me think about it.
[02:42:19.944 --> 02:42:20.344]  Shield?
[02:42:20.484 --> 02:42:20.964]  I like it.
[02:42:21.305 --> 02:42:21.785]  I like it.
[02:42:23.626 --> 02:42:25.968]  Let's go back to that logo and talk about what that means.
[02:42:27.711 --> 02:42:29.393]  Because we've got to be the sovereigns, don't we?
[02:42:29.433 --> 02:42:34.778]  We've got to stand up in our own birthright and declare that we're free and that we're above the system.
[02:42:34.798 --> 02:42:36.279]  I mean, that's what America was supposedly about.
[02:42:36.299 --> 02:42:39.062]  Didn't mean we ever actually realized it, but we're saying we're sovereign.
[02:42:39.082 --> 02:42:43.566]  There's no king over us because we are the lords and ladies of our own lives.
[02:42:43.626 --> 02:42:44.707]  Our homes are our castles.
[02:42:45.748 --> 02:42:48.631]  Yeah, if you look at the Ho-Tep Nation logo, or let's start with the name.
[02:42:49.184 --> 02:42:52.665]  So, of course, HOTEP is going to tell you the ideology, and you have the word nation.
[02:42:52.725 --> 02:42:56.186]  Today, we have people that want to defeat nationalism.
[02:42:56.346 --> 02:42:58.186]  Nationalism is basically tribalism.
[02:42:58.226 --> 02:43:05.388]  What you're basically saying is you're trying to remove people's freedom of association, which means you want to control us.
[02:43:05.488 --> 02:43:10.249]  They're saying, we don't want you to even have any ideology or any kinship or any crew that stands up for you.
[02:43:10.269 --> 02:43:12.910]  We want you alone, by yourself, so we can destroy you.
[02:43:13.790 --> 02:43:14.911]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:43:15.091 --> 02:43:16.211]  Or you rock with the state.
[02:43:16.838 --> 02:43:19.179]  So that's why it's HOTEP in the nation.
[02:43:19.519 --> 02:43:25.240]  And then when you look at the crown, the crown is basically denoting our royalty.
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:36.202]  A lot of people want to say that, you know, if we're talking colorful, black people came from slavery and we don't follow that ideology, you know?
[02:43:36.703 --> 02:43:41.644]  We come from the ideology that we come from Pharaoh, which are the European equivalent to kings.
[02:43:42.524 --> 02:43:42.664]  So
[02:43:43.354 --> 02:43:44.475]  We were royalty.
[02:43:44.695 --> 02:43:46.276]  You know, a lot of people say we was kings.
[02:43:46.296 --> 02:43:46.997]  We was kings.
[02:43:47.117 --> 02:43:48.397]  I don't, I don't deal in it.
[02:43:48.417 --> 02:43:49.778]  You know, somebody said something today.
[02:43:49.798 --> 02:43:52.160]  They said, some white lady, she apologized today.
[02:43:52.380 --> 02:43:56.463]  She said, oh, oh, I'm sorry that your ancestors went through slavery.
[02:43:56.523 --> 02:43:58.744]  I said, I'm sorry your ancestors went through slavery.
[02:43:59.064 --> 02:44:00.325]  Because the Slavs had it bad.
[02:44:00.345 --> 02:44:01.546]  The Irish had it bad.
[02:44:01.686 --> 02:44:02.106]  Exactly.
[02:44:02.166 --> 02:44:02.667]  I was there.
[02:44:02.727 --> 02:44:03.847]  It's supposedly going to air tomorrow.
[02:44:03.868 --> 02:44:05.028]  We'll see if it does with TIP, T-I.
[02:44:06.249 --> 02:44:08.750]  And he kept bringing up slavery, and I said, listen, it's going on everywhere.
[02:44:08.790 --> 02:44:09.671]  Everybody had it in their past.
[02:44:10.191 --> 02:44:12.032]  But we are the greater things in our past.
[02:44:12.132 --> 02:44:14.633]  I'm not belittling it or taking away from it, he was saying.
[02:44:15.094 --> 02:44:17.915]  I'm saying I don't look at the bad stuff as my identity.
[02:44:17.935 --> 02:44:23.378]  I look at the great things as my identity, and people moving forward not being victims.
[02:44:23.418 --> 02:44:30.522]  And these people just, I don't care if it's white kids, black kids, whoever it is, they get into being victims, and they obsess on it, and I'm sick of it.
[02:44:31.752 --> 02:44:32.392]  Well, I think T.I.
[02:44:32.512 --> 02:44:33.512]  is a lot older.
[02:44:33.532 --> 02:44:35.793]  He's not a lot older, but he's older than me.
[02:44:35.833 --> 02:44:48.375]  And that generation was inundated a lot, where we confuse the, quote-unquote, colorful black power movement with, you know, gripe.
[02:44:48.675 --> 02:44:51.095]  It's always in juxtaposition with white people, right?
[02:44:51.795 --> 02:44:54.216]  It's always about, you know, we overcame.
[02:44:54.556 --> 02:44:56.036]  We do overcome.
[02:44:56.196 --> 02:45:00.197]  Anytime you say overcome, you're basically putting white people in a conversation.
[02:45:00.973 --> 02:45:01.893]  So, he has to be...
[02:45:19.981 --> 02:45:24.082]  Yeah, group up, get with your tribe, mind your business, and build.
[02:45:24.343 --> 02:45:26.283]  Because we got enemies on all fronts.
[02:45:26.643 --> 02:45:30.084]  The other day I watched the Arabs smack the shit out of some white ladies.
[02:45:30.225 --> 02:45:31.245]  I mean, some black ladies.
[02:45:34.586 --> 02:45:40.108]  There was a black business that was in hair, and she was out in California, melanating young ladies.
[02:45:40.488 --> 02:45:46.470]  And after a year, her business went out of business because the Korean wouldn't sell to her.
[02:45:47.821 --> 02:45:50.443]  You talking about the white man, your enemy, man?
[02:45:50.743 --> 02:45:52.964]  Everybody has a tribe.
[02:45:53.104 --> 02:45:56.786]  If you can't stick to your tribe and work with your tribe, there's a problem.
[02:45:56.826 --> 02:46:00.829]  And if your tribe is talking about other tribes, you are really in deep shit.
[02:46:01.249 --> 02:46:01.629]  You know?
[02:46:02.029 --> 02:46:06.512]  So, TI has to be unconditioned.
[02:46:06.552 --> 02:46:07.572]  We have to recondition TI.
[02:46:08.709 --> 02:46:22.995]  To focus on us, you know, like when we look at that re-vote TV thing with Candace Owens, why would you bring up Donald Trump in the Mecca, you know, the melanated Mecca of America, Atlanta?
[02:46:23.015 --> 02:46:26.136]  That's where all the, you know, African-related people are.
[02:46:26.396 --> 02:46:28.717]  It's basically our capital.
[02:46:29.257 --> 02:46:33.139]  So why would you have all these black people on this panel
[02:46:34.054 --> 02:46:35.435]  And talk about Trump.
[02:46:35.615 --> 02:46:38.397]  Like, what does he have to do with uplifting our nation?
[02:46:38.617 --> 02:46:38.978]  You know?
[02:46:38.998 --> 02:46:41.399]  Like, focus on yourself.
[02:46:42.020 --> 02:46:45.642]  But again, he's from a different generation that hasn't been able to take himself.
[02:46:45.942 --> 02:46:48.904]  I was caught in that mental trap at one point.
[02:46:49.164 --> 02:46:52.507]  You know, so focused on, you know, the so-called white man.
[02:46:52.687 --> 02:46:53.628]  I was focused on that.
[02:46:53.668 --> 02:47:01.853]  And then I got out of that mentality and I started seeing how it's much more freeing and it's much more liberating and I became more powerful because I'm able to be myself.
[02:47:01.873 --> 02:47:02.934]  Well, exactly, and expanding on that,
[02:47:03.394 --> 02:47:04.755]  Everybody's got their own issues.
[02:47:04.815 --> 02:47:06.657]  And people have had all these old scores and fights.
[02:47:06.977 --> 02:47:10.900]  But the globalists are here to replace humans with a post-human world.
[02:47:10.940 --> 02:47:14.763]  They play us off against each other on purpose while they're dominating.
[02:47:14.923 --> 02:47:16.124]  We have to deal with that.
[02:47:16.384 --> 02:47:17.885]  And they've wound up China.
[02:47:18.826 --> 02:47:23.712]  With one-sided deals to dominate everybody, and if we don't deal with that, they're enslaving the Chinese people.
[02:47:23.732 --> 02:47:26.014]  They're not getting ahead under this, and they're dominating us.
[02:47:26.094 --> 02:47:31.380]  We're all getting screwed by the globalist ally with China and the big banks and Hollywood, and that's the enemy.
[02:47:31.641 --> 02:47:32.742]  Humanity's under attack.
[02:47:33.122 --> 02:47:33.363]  Bye.
[02:47:33.683 --> 02:47:42.606]  Radical orthodox Islam, in my view, the EU tyranny, the CHICOM threat, and this whole globalist, leftist, central banking cartel.
[02:47:42.946 --> 02:47:47.928]  And they are all combined against everybody else, and training us to all fight with each other.
[02:47:48.148 --> 02:47:51.829]  And it doesn't mean there aren't issues and things going on, but the point is that it doesn't matter.
[02:47:51.909 --> 02:48:01.813]  The big overarching thing, putting fluoride in all our water, putting GMO in all of this, putting 5G out, trying to break up all of our families, is this sinister, evil, globalist force.
[02:48:02.353 --> 02:48:05.275]  And if you don't wake up to that, we're all going to lose, period.
[02:48:06.156 --> 02:48:09.578]  They're trying to pit the African against the Anglo-Saxon.
[02:48:10.299 --> 02:48:13.240]  And they've been doing it for centuries now.
[02:48:13.621 --> 02:48:16.283]  But we've been allies for a really long time.
[02:48:16.343 --> 02:48:18.264]  If you go look at the Moroccan treaty,
[02:48:19.474 --> 02:48:21.216]  The Moroccan-American Treaty.
[02:48:21.597 --> 02:48:22.358]  You'll see that.
[02:48:22.859 --> 02:48:25.402]  America's first ally was an African nation.
[02:48:52.014 --> 02:48:56.197]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:48:57.818 --> 02:49:01.320]  Bill Gates and his father, who ran Planned Parenthood, are right.
[02:49:02.922 --> 02:49:07.725]  We need to dumb down, sterilize, and abort as many people as we can.
[02:49:08.805 --> 02:49:16.551]  We need to put as much fluoride in the water of those that are born to dumb them down as much as possible so they're more easily managed.
[02:49:17.151 --> 02:49:20.954]  You see, I've decided to try to join Bill Gates and try to start thinking like him.
[02:49:21.761 --> 02:49:26.484]  Worldwide, he directed genetically engineered mosquitoes to bite us and give us diseases.
[02:49:26.985 --> 02:49:29.066]  But he said it was in the name of helping people.
[02:49:29.646 --> 02:49:37.632]  Just like he funded the projects of these, quote, sterilized male mosquitoes that would go out in Brazil and cause the other mosquito populations to implode.
[02:49:37.652 --> 02:49:41.034]  But now, they mutated and the numbers exploded!
[02:49:41.555 --> 02:49:44.677]  And suddenly, the mosquitoes are making people much sicker.
[02:49:45.537 --> 02:49:47.459]  Oh, it wasn't a mistake.
[02:49:47.519 --> 02:49:48.279]  None of it was.
[02:49:48.319 --> 02:49:48.900]  Now, I'm hilarious.
[02:49:49.500 --> 02:49:51.220]  Of course, transmitted by mosquitoes.
[02:49:51.701 --> 02:49:52.601]  I brought some here.
[02:49:53.061 --> 02:49:55.982]  There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
[02:49:56.022 --> 02:50:02.424]  Let me tell you, except 5G, 4G, 3G, it's killing us all.
[02:50:02.464 --> 02:50:02.804]  We deserve to die.
[02:50:03.644 --> 02:50:05.884]  And don't go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:50:06.145 --> 02:50:06.585]  Oh, no.
[02:50:07.165 --> 02:50:09.665]  Don't get high-quality fish oil or turmeric.
[02:50:10.066 --> 02:50:11.126]  It fights inflammation.
[02:50:11.366 --> 02:50:13.387]  Don't get any of the great antioxidants we have.
[02:50:13.687 --> 02:50:17.248]  Don't get ultimate bone broth that's selling out at 50% off.
[02:50:17.288 --> 02:50:18.168]  It's the last week to get it.
[02:50:18.888 --> 02:50:24.571]  We don't support organizations and institutions that are independent and fighting for a pro-human future.
[02:50:25.451 --> 02:50:30.214]  Roll over to Bella Melinda Gates, the rightful rulers of this earth.
[02:50:31.054 --> 02:50:34.596]  Do not go to Infowarsstore.com and support me.
[02:50:35.637 --> 02:50:37.618]  And do not spread the articles and videos.
[02:50:38.058 --> 02:50:39.479]  Just give up and submit.
[02:50:39.779 --> 02:50:41.520]  Give your children over to Billy Boy.
[02:50:42.180 --> 02:50:43.221]  Truth is Satan's good.
[02:50:46.459 --> 02:50:47.420]  All right, thanks for watching.
[02:50:47.900 --> 02:50:49.441]  And thank you, Bill Gates, for all you do.
[02:50:49.501 --> 02:50:50.562]  Thanks for those mosquitoes.
[02:50:50.942 --> 02:50:51.903]  Thanks for 5G.
[02:50:52.203 --> 02:50:53.143]  Thanks for the chemtrails.
[02:50:57.086 --> 02:50:59.307]  A gentleman just walked up to me in his picture line.
[02:50:59.327 --> 02:51:04.631]  He says, I have an AR-15, and I will turn this in if it means saving the lives of our kids.
[02:51:04.971 --> 02:51:06.212]  People want to do the right thing.
[02:51:06.332 --> 02:51:09.894]  Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, non-gun owners alike.
[02:51:10.194 --> 02:51:13.096]  I think we're naive to think that we can just maintain the status quo.
[02:51:13.917 --> 02:51:15.838]  Beto knows what he's doing.
[02:51:17.421 --> 02:51:20.822]  He's sitting there telling you that, oh, a man just walked up to me.
[02:51:20.982 --> 02:51:21.742]  It's a total lie.
[02:51:22.383 --> 02:51:26.964]  And said, oh, I'm going to turn in my AR-15 so people don't get hurt.
[02:51:27.965 --> 02:51:35.507]  That's selling the idea that if you own a gun, you're responsible for what criminals do with a gun.
[02:51:36.307 --> 02:51:38.528]  That is such a fraud.
[02:51:38.588 --> 02:51:40.349]  It's so anti-American.
[02:51:41.089 --> 02:51:42.750]  Now, you can always tell him Beto's lying.
[02:51:42.810 --> 02:51:43.750]  His lips are moving.
[02:51:45.069 --> 02:51:46.430]  Or his brain's thinking.
[02:51:47.091 --> 02:51:48.112]  The man's a total fraud.
[02:51:48.773 --> 02:51:54.738]  His father-in-law's worth $28 billion, a big anti-American globalist, gave a billion dollars to Bechtel's wife.
[02:51:55.339 --> 02:52:00.764]  The guy wrote papers fantasizing about killing children, running them over with cars.
[02:52:01.305 --> 02:52:02.866]  He got arrested for a hit-and-run.
[02:52:03.427 --> 02:52:04.968]  He got arrested for burglary.
[02:52:05.349 --> 02:52:07.391]  The man isn't allowed to own a gun.
[02:52:07.651 --> 02:52:09.132]  He is a deranged criminal.
[02:52:10.031 --> 02:52:12.192]  But of course, deranged criminals want your guns.
[02:52:12.552 --> 02:52:21.495]  They're now turning their guns and are facing five years in jail in New Zealand, even though the man that shot those people wasn't from New Zealand and got the guns illegally.
[02:52:21.715 --> 02:52:26.957]  The globalists want to have a revolution against America, and they want us disarmed before they do it.
[02:52:26.977 --> 02:52:31.919]  1776 could commence again at any time, because they're losing their information war.
[02:52:32.759 --> 02:52:34.100]  Against us, because we're telling the truth.
[02:52:34.781 --> 02:52:39.585]  And so now, Beto is making his move with others, and he has to be rebuked.
[02:52:40.105 --> 02:52:41.046]  He has to be exposed.
[02:52:41.146 --> 02:52:47.712]  And the way to do it is not be intimidated about your Second Amendment, and let them know that you're fully aware of what they're trying to do.
[02:52:48.172 --> 02:52:52.616]  Beto's campaign says, if you want to prove you're not a bad person, turn your guns in.
[02:52:52.816 --> 02:52:54.457]  Hey, Beto, you turn your guns in.
[02:52:55.058 --> 02:52:58.641]  It's a campaign slogan where he says, turn them in to show you're good.
[02:52:58.821 --> 02:53:00.122]  Lay down your arms, you devil!
[02:53:00.913 --> 02:53:01.494]  Hands up!
[02:53:01.654 --> 02:53:02.035]  Come out!
[02:53:02.575 --> 02:53:04.758]  And we'll take you away to the gulag.
[02:53:05.459 --> 02:53:07.822]  They're literally trying to disarm us.
[02:53:08.563 --> 02:53:11.548]  They openly say they want to put conservatives in forced labor camps.
[02:53:11.568 --> 02:53:12.669]  They openly say they want to kill us.
[02:53:13.250 --> 02:53:17.375]  They openly say they want to destroy us because we support Trump or America.
[02:53:18.285 --> 02:53:19.805]  We've got to stand up and say no.
[02:53:19.906 --> 02:53:22.006]  And you've got to fund those that are fighting.
[02:53:22.286 --> 02:53:24.647]  Because we're pro-Second Amendment, we're under massive attack.
[02:53:25.087 --> 02:53:26.468]  Hack attack, lawsuits, you name it.
[02:53:26.868 --> 02:53:32.990]  But you can help us stand against this and spread the word on the street against these bullies with a great shirt like Beto Knott.

[02:53:49.583 --> 02:53:50.044]  Hell yes!
[02:53:50.164 --> 02:53:55.050]  We're gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47... And it is very hard to think about this.
[02:53:56.271 --> 02:53:56.332]  Um...
