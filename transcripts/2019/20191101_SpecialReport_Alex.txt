[00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:15.360]  Big Pharma has been caught in a giant hoax with their lapdog controlled corporate press that does nothing but spew out their propaganda and PR.
[00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:19.864]  And I'm gonna get to that huge development in just a moment.
[00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:25.448]  This is an even bigger fraud and in my view criminal action
[00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:42.348]  than what Monsanto did for more than 40 years, telling the world that glyphosate, or Roundup, was safe to drink, when a glass of it will kill you deader than a hammer and have you pushing daisies.
[00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:53.675]  And that, of course, is what Patrick Moore, their famous head lobbyist, would tell the world in hundreds of TV, radio, and print interviews.
[00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:58.877]  But finally, he got his bluff called and wouldn't drink it.
[00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:02.858]  Glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer.
[00:01:03.118 --> 00:01:05.438]  You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you.
[00:01:06.478 --> 00:01:07.359]  You want to drink some?
[00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:08.139]  We have some here.
[00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:09.399]  I'd be happy to, actually.
[00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:11.760]  Not really, but... Not really?
[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.700]  I know it wouldn't hurt me.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.320]  If you say so.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.220]  I have some glyphosate.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.161]  No, I'm not stupid.
[00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:19.501]  Okay, so you... So it's dangerous, right?
[00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:22.982]  No, people try to commit suicide with it and fail fairly regularly.
[00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:23.962]  Tell the truth.
[00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:25.383]  It's not dangerous to humans.
[00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:26.303]  No, it's not.
[00:01:26.463 --> 00:01:28.705]  So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate?
[00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:29.565]  No, I'm not an idiot.
[00:01:30.025 --> 00:01:48.494]  Since that interview took place on national Canadian television just a few years ago, courts around the world and major governments have certified that glyphosate does indeed grow all sorts of horrible tumors in the body and they knew all along but still dumped this deadly product on the market worldwide.
[00:01:49.264 --> 00:01:52.746]  Now, let's look at what Big Pharma is doing today.
[00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:55.247]  And again, our story starts in Canada.
[00:01:56.007 --> 00:02:13.376]  Just a few days ago, on national television at a press conference, one of the top health ministers in the nation said that she was taking the shot because it was safe and effective, but everyone could see on the video, there was no needle on the end of the injector.
[00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:17.658]  We'll show you that footage at full speed, then slowed down and blown up.
[00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:20.659]  Officially kicking off this year's flu vaccine.
[00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.982]  Christine Elliott was one of the first people to get the flu shot this morning at Women's College Hospital.
[00:02:26.562 --> 00:02:29.423]  Elliott is urging the public to get the free shot.
[00:02:29.603 --> 00:02:31.184]  As you can see, there's no needle.
[00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:33.165]  You notice there's no mark on her arm.
[00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:35.586]  This, my friends, is a staged event.
[00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:36.586]  But it doesn't stop there.
[00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:44.290]  There are countless examples at the Golden Globes and other big public events where the media, again, deceives and says, oh,
[00:02:45.908 --> 00:02:49.511]  All these Hollywood stars are gonna be given their flu shot.
[00:02:50.411 --> 00:03:00.819]  Now, you then see the so-called nurses, who are really just other actors, go out on the floor with what is clearly not flu vaccines, and then inject them through their clothes.
[00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:08.064]  And if you slow down the video, you can see them telling the stars, don't worry, I'm not really injecting you with this.
[00:03:08.124 --> 00:03:13.508]  They cover it up with their hand and simulate it, but tell you that they really did it.
[00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:18.959]  So roll up your sleeves, Hollywood, because you're all getting... FLU SHOTS!
[00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:25.827]  You know you wore a sleeveless gown for a reason!
[00:03:25.888 --> 00:03:26.208]  Hey!
[00:03:26.368 --> 00:03:26.849]  Shots!
[00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:27.169]  Shots!
[00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.610]  Shots!
[00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.930]  Shots!
[00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.230]  Shots!
[00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.531]  Shots!
[00:03:28.611 --> 00:03:28.951]  Shots!
[00:03:29.071 --> 00:03:29.912]  Excuse me, ma'am?
[00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:30.533]  Ma'am?
[00:03:30.553 --> 00:03:34.698]  You're definitely gonna want to get the phone!
[00:03:53.155 --> 00:03:56.398]  Now there are examples of this too many to go over.
[00:03:57.244 --> 00:04:03.668]  But when you do see them on the news saying, oh look, it's safe and effective, realize that in almost every case, they're not really taking the shot.
[00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:16.778]  But in the case of Piers Morgan, he bought the program a few years ago, told people to take it, did take it, you can see he took it, and later he told the world that it almost killed him.
[00:04:17.517 --> 00:04:20.318]  Because I'm about to have my first ever flu shot.
[00:04:20.478 --> 00:04:22.918]  And I thought, couldn't get a better guy than you to do it.
[00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:31.941]  So, the myth about these, and I'm told it's a myth, is that you can actually get flu, or flu-like symptoms, simply by having the shot.
[00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:32.561]  Is that true?
[00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:37.543]  You cannot get the flu from the flu shot because the material is actually dead flu virus.
[00:04:37.563 --> 00:04:38.823]  Alright, that's it, that's it.
[00:04:39.043 --> 00:04:40.743]  One, two, three.
[00:04:41.224 --> 00:04:41.344]  Oh!
[00:04:41.444 --> 00:04:42.484]  And we're all pleased.
[00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:45.693]  Run, meet later.
[00:04:45.713 --> 00:04:48.334]  25 million records, Dwight Yoakam is much more than a country superstar.
[00:04:48.634 --> 00:04:51.356]  He's a talented actor with a lot to say about issues that matter to America.
[00:04:51.636 --> 00:04:53.097]  Dwight's latest album is Three Pairs.
[00:04:53.137 --> 00:04:53.797]  Welcome to you, Dwight.
[00:04:54.198 --> 00:04:54.398]  Thank you.
[00:04:54.418 --> 00:04:55.658]  Before we go any further, you're a singer.
[00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:56.219]  Yeah.
[00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.320]  You must have had sore throats over the years.
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.940]  I hear that.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.941]  As you can tell, things are deteriorating.
[00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:02.362]  Is there any advice you can give me?
[00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:04.123]  Don't ever take a flu shot again.
[00:05:04.143 --> 00:05:08.446]  I watched that night with Dr. Oz, and in deference to Dr. Oz, I think he's
[00:05:08.626 --> 00:05:09.886]  We're both doing the maths, aren't we?
[00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:15.428]  We both saw him put that thing in my arm, and within 10 days, I'm just struck down.
[00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.609]  You know what?
[00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.270]  I don't want to tell anybody out there, I'm not a medical advisor.
[00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.051]  Get your vaccines if you... I don't believe that.
[00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:26.192]  I'm just suspicious by nature, and I saw you get it, and here we are.
[00:05:26.573 --> 00:05:31.194]  Big Pharma drug ads have been called the most incredible, unintentional comedy ever.
[00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:35.596]  It tells you it'll help your skin rash clear up, it'll give you a heart attack or cancer.
[00:05:36.616 --> 00:05:37.337]  Got anxiety?
[00:05:37.397 --> 00:05:38.478]  Hey great, take this pill.
[00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:41.981]  But it will increase your chances of suicide or homicidal mania.
[00:05:42.562 --> 00:05:46.086]  Like the whole Prozac family of drugs that 20% of the public roughly are on.
[00:05:47.067 --> 00:05:53.873]  But we've juxtaposed some of the flu shot ads in with the reality, even in mainstream news, of what's happening.
[00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.501]  The truth is, if you read the inserts, they admit how dangerous they are, and they have liability protection.
[00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:05.382]  Other drug classes don't have liability protection.
[00:06:06.142 --> 00:06:09.303]  And they themselves are constantly having to pull drugs off the market.
[00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:13.545]  At times like these, you might ask yourself, how did I get here?
[00:06:14.205 --> 00:06:18.766]  Baseball, basketball, tennis, Jordan McFarlane is an avid athlete.
[00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:21.867]  But a week ago, something stopped him in his tracks.
[00:06:22.327 --> 00:06:24.308]  Thursday afternoon, he got his flu shots,
[00:06:24.727 --> 00:06:28.250]  And by 10 o'clock Friday morning, he had chills and started feeling weak.
[00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.793]  And by 4 that afternoon, he was having spasms.
[00:06:32.553 --> 00:06:33.274]  It's flu season.
[00:06:34.114 --> 00:06:36.717]  And at our age, flu can be more serious.
[00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:38.818]  Nobody has time for that.
[00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:42.781]  It would be dishonest to say that we know for sure the vaccine is going to be safe for everybody.
[00:06:43.022 --> 00:06:45.744]  You give a vaccine to a couple hundred million people, there are going to be problems.
[00:06:46.536 --> 00:06:48.957]  Charlie was given the flu jab at 4 p.m.
[00:06:49.077 --> 00:06:51.018]  on Friday the 23rd of September 2011.
[00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.181]  Hours later he went to sleep and has been predominantly asleep ever since.
[00:06:57.201 --> 00:07:03.184]  Maybe you didn't know, people with the flu can spread it up to 6 feet away.
[00:07:03.204 --> 00:07:05.084]  I can tell things are deteriorating.
[00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:06.365]  Is there any advice you can give me?
[00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:08.226]  Don't ever take a flu shot again.
[00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:14.579]  But as we age, our immune system can weaken, and traditional flu shots may not work as well for us.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.683]  I love to sew and crochet.
[00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:19.205]  I can't do that now.
[00:07:19.826 --> 00:07:20.827]  I can't even read.
[00:07:20.847 --> 00:07:23.691]  That flu shot did me in.
[00:07:24.412 --> 00:07:26.334]  By shielding yourself with a flu shot at Rite Aid.
[00:07:27.115 --> 00:07:30.837]  Where one simple stop can protect you from this season's strains of flu.
[00:07:30.977 --> 00:07:33.998]  I have more concern about the vaccine than I do about the swine flu.
[00:07:34.618 --> 00:07:35.919]  It's been rushed to market.
[00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:40.421]  There are high levels of adjuncts which basically make it more potent.
[00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:46.163]  Flu Zone High Dose is a flu vaccine designed specifically for patients aged 65 and older.
[00:07:46.723 --> 00:07:50.105]  This vaccine helps older patients develop better immune responses.
[00:07:50.265 --> 00:07:56.847]  A total of 23 deaths were reported during the day 29 through 180 post-vaccination.
[00:07:56.867 --> 00:08:00.648]  16 among flu zone high dose recipients and 7 among flu zone recipients.
[00:08:00.688 --> 00:08:04.389]  So the high dose is definitely killing twice as many seniors.
[00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:06.870]  Designed for adults 65 and older.
[00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:13.332]  Unlike other flu shots, Flu-Ed contains an immune enhancing ingredient that can help provide a strong immune response to the flu.
[00:08:13.892 --> 00:08:15.314]  Sure, the numbers are pretty good.
[00:08:15.775 --> 00:08:19.599]  At best, about 60% of people who get the shot will dodge the flu.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.503]  At worst, only 10% will be protected.
[00:08:23.124 --> 00:08:25.026]  I'm going to get it, if that helps at all.
[00:08:25.066 --> 00:08:26.809]  But I'll tell you, my wife is not getting me as her kids.
[00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:29.993]  Because I've got four of them, and when I go home, I'm not Dr. Oz, I'm Mr. Oz.
[00:08:31.118 --> 00:08:32.919]  Get your flu shot at Rite Aid today.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:39.104]  In closing tonight, I want to show you a short clip of Mark Zuckerberg just about a week and a half ago before Congress.
[00:08:39.945 --> 00:08:47.912]  And a congressman asking the question, why are you banning sites and individuals and consumer groups that are exposing vaccine damage?
[00:08:48.432 --> 00:08:50.394]  Are you saying there's no side effects or damage?
[00:08:51.186 --> 00:08:54.328]  And Zuckerberg tried to basically backpedal on it.
[00:08:54.829 --> 00:09:08.639]  But the truth is the entire corporate internet from Google to Facebook to Twitter is absolutely clamping down on filmmakers and victims and consumer reviews and reports and not letting any of the truth get out.
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:17.386]  This is happening at the same time while big pharma all over the world and including the US is trying to make vaccines compulsory
[00:09:18.371 --> 00:09:25.236]  As the number of side effects and damages increases, and as the number of vaccines they're trying to make us take increase.
[00:09:25.916 --> 00:09:27.577]  Think about how dangerous this is.
[00:09:28.178 --> 00:09:41.727]  An industry above the law, that has liability protection and is immune, who's trying to make us take their tainted product, and when we complain about it, we get banned from the internet.
[00:09:42.605 --> 00:09:45.006]  This is a science fiction dystopia.
[00:09:45.607 --> 00:09:46.547]  And it's not fiction.
[00:09:47.347 --> 00:09:48.228]  It's happening now.
[00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:53.931]  Are you 100% confident that vaccines pose no injury to any person on this planet?
[00:09:54.971 --> 00:10:07.718]  Congressman, I don't think it would be possible for anyone to be 100% confident, but my understanding of the scientific consensus is that it is important that people get their vaccines.
[00:10:09.492 --> 00:10:15.835]  But you said your platform, you want to, you believe in giving people a voice.
[00:10:16.756 --> 00:10:22.659]  Doesn't somebody, shouldn't somebody have the opportunity to express an opinion different from yours?
[00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:25.981]  I mean over four billion dollars has been paid out by the fund.
[00:10:26.621 --> 00:10:28.322]  Over four thousands of people.
[00:10:29.263 --> 00:10:33.345]  Don't you think people should be able to have information to make an informed choice?
[00:10:34.451 --> 00:10:35.232]  Congressman, I do.
[00:10:35.252 --> 00:10:40.895]  And that's why we don't stop people from posting on their page something that's wrong.
[00:10:41.336 --> 00:10:52.163]  If someone wants to post vaccine, anti-vaccination content, or if they want to join a group where people are discussing that content, we don't prevent them from doing that.
[00:10:52.543 --> 00:11:00.986]  But what we do is we don't go out of our way to make sure that our group recommendation systems try to show people or encourage people to join those groups.
[00:11:01.326 --> 00:11:04.447]  If you type in the name of a group exactly, you can get the group.
[00:11:04.947 --> 00:11:05.648]  We're not going to hide it.
[00:11:05.668 --> 00:11:07.108]  We're not going to prevent you from joining it.
[00:11:08.029 --> 00:11:14.731]  But we're not going to recommend or go out of our way to show people content that would encourage people to join those groups.
[00:11:25.575 --> 00:11:35.965]  That was a powerful report and I hope that you will research the claims we made in the report and find out for yourself that it's much worse than we can even put in this short breakdown.
[00:11:36.606 --> 00:11:44.013]  And then I hope you will share this report from ban.video to everyone you know and re-upload it on YouTube and Twitter.
[00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:47.697]  Just don't put my name in it or Infowars in it or they'll ban it or block it.
[00:11:48.157 --> 00:12:11.830]  How about you put something in the headline like, vaccines make you live forever, or a review of how wondrous they are, and then the AI won't ban it, because AI doesn't get humor, and it might get a million views before some globalist, control freak, boffin, finds that you've been engaging in thought crime and blacks it out.
[00:12:12.892 --> 00:12:18.815]  But now more than ever, human intelligence resisting these individuals is absolutely critical.
[00:12:18.855 --> 00:12:31.240]  So please, we need to expose the fact that the vaccines are a carrier for a whole class of viruses and other contaminants that are being put there, in most cases, on purpose.
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:37.523]  Remember, hundreds of thousands worldwide were given syphilis in vaccines that the US government
[00:12:38.163 --> 00:12:41.367]  Told them, again, were vaccines for something else.
[00:12:41.907 --> 00:12:43.149]  Measles, mumps and rubella.
[00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:51.518]  So we have a scientific elite in control of major Western governments that is carrying out a soft kill agenda against us.
[00:12:52.299 --> 00:12:55.682]  And videos and reports like this are critical to get out.
[00:12:56.303 --> 00:13:12.276]  It's also critical to support operations like InfoWars that are under attack by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and under attack by Hillary Clinton's law firms who are trying to shut us down right now so that we can't warn you and then help get you information so you can warn others.
