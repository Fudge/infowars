[00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:04.962]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:05.062 --> 00:00:06.083]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:06.203 --> 00:00:06.883]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:10.765]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:20.229]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.990]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.016]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:34.739]  JFK was shot from the back and the front.
[00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:37.262]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:00:37.502 --> 00:00:38.223]  It just pancaked.
[00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:40.886]  It took the babies out of incubators.
[00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:43.850]  Lucky children to die on the front lines.
[00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.531]  I think this is a national security impairment.
[00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:53.354]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work operating in areas that we can't control.
[00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:53.694]  U.S.A.
[00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:55.835]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:57.056]  Is it one world?
[00:00:57.096 --> 00:00:58.877]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:01.958]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:02.778]  Some former U.S.
[00:01:02.798 --> 00:01:04.959]  naval officers say it was on purpose.
[00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.361]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:14.185]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:15.746]  Russian scum!
[00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:16.567]  Denied everything.
[00:01:16.607 --> 00:01:17.928]  He called it all fake news.
[00:01:18.088 --> 00:01:20.990]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.151]  This is a national emergency.
[00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:28.715]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.657]  This is a FEMA high-level emergency.
[00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:33.958]  We are at war with Russia.
[00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:39.641]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange in which case?
[00:01:40.062 --> 00:01:42.763]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[00:01:42.943 --> 00:01:45.545]  If they can shut us down, you're next!
[00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:49.767]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:52.028]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:52.108 --> 00:01:52.348]  Info War.
[00:01:58.162 --> 00:01:59.424]  It's Tuesday, April 30th, 2019.
[00:01:59.524 --> 00:02:03.708]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:02:04.588 --> 00:02:14.097]  Broadcasting worldwide on the AM and FM dial, Global Shortwave, and of course, many television stations across the country and InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:02:16.972 --> 00:02:33.520]  A theme has emerged from the president and from his advisors and from patriots that are in the Pentagon and also from a lot of former actual CIA counterterrorism experts and people that have been in the field and been in command of large operations, not leftist pencil pushing.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.142]  That's the other CIA we've been battling the last few years trying to get the country back.
[00:02:39.978 --> 00:02:57.291]  It's emerged that it is confirmed, and Congress is even set to have hearings on this, on the attempted coup against Trump, that there is still an ongoing embedded group of criminals being directed by Obama, Hillary, and others, and that they are still trying to overthrow Trump and destroy the First Amendment.
[00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:00.153]  They're allied with big tech and the Communist Chinese.
[00:03:00.854 --> 00:03:04.376]  And so it's now coming out that Biden has gotten billions
[00:03:05.177 --> 00:03:10.941]  To his sons, that's B with a B, not millions, from communist Chinese state-run companies.
[00:03:11.661 --> 00:03:15.443]  Joe Biden should have obviously be arrested for treason and tried and dealt with accordingly.
[00:03:16.044 --> 00:03:17.364]  But it's all hiding in plain view.
[00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:23.228]  That's why they're fighting so hard and won't give up because they've gotten so far down the rat hole.
[00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:30.953]  They drug this country so deep down the rat hole that they still believe they can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
[00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:34.305]  So it's all coming out.
[00:03:34.386 --> 00:03:36.087]  The chickens are coming home to roost.
[00:03:36.127 --> 00:03:39.269]  We have Rosenstein resigning yesterday.
[00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.311]  We have the head of the Air Force Academy, obviously.
[00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:47.415]  A lot of evidence shows involved staging those racial events for political correctness and mind control being removed.
[00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:51.298]  We have the head of Gitmo being removed, and I'm told that a lot more is about to happen.
[00:03:51.738 --> 00:03:56.140]  The heads are going to start rolling in a big, fat, juicy way.
[00:03:56.621 --> 00:04:02.684]  Larry C. Johnson, formerly with the CIA and covert operations, he'll be in a bunch of other operations.
[00:04:03.064 --> 00:04:05.245]  He'll be joining us to get into this ongoing coup.
[00:04:05.605 --> 00:04:15.431]  We're going to play clips from a powerful report that's in a Paul Joseph Watson report up at newswars.com and infowars.com that we'll play when we come back that I hope you'll share with everyone you know.
[00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:29.681]  Former CIA officer warns leftist violence is going to get very, very bad over the next two years, that it's being concerted and driven by deep state in bed groups, and that they're planning to overthrow the president and planning to kill police and mass.
[00:04:30.141 --> 00:04:36.946]  And that's a former CIA officer, Kevin Shipp, who's an expert in counterterrorism, warns that leftist violence is about to hit.
[00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:48.909]  And of course, that is very evident, but we're just here reporting the facts, why they want us off air, so they believe they have air superiority in the information war when they launch these attempted coups that have already failed.
[00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:51.269]  But when they don't first succeed, they try and try again.
[00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:52.069]  We're winning.
[00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.390]  We're winning, but the enemy can still take us out.
[00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.451]  That's why we've got to intensify efforts against the globalists now.
[00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:01.272]  Everyone, full effort now.
[00:05:01.292 --> 00:05:06.353]  I've been doing a lot of... InfoWars.
[00:05:07.577 --> 00:05:10.418]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:15.141]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border, talks about MS-13 and more.
[00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:16.001]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:16.561]  Yes, sir.
[00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:17.802]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:05:17.922 --> 00:05:19.743]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:25.886]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sports shirts, all the equipment.
[00:05:25.926 --> 00:05:27.807]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[00:05:27.867 --> 00:05:28.787]  God bless you, brother.
[00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:35.230]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread
[00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.971]  You're our only hope, brother.
[00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:38.912]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:42.013]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[00:06:08.402 --> 00:06:12.404]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:14.964 --> 00:06:18.986]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:26.489 --> 00:06:35.132]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:07:01.423]  All right, Larry C. Johnson worked in the CIA for many years in counterterrorism and he's going to be joining us coming up in the next hour, hour number two, and he said rightly that we are in the middle of a civil war in this country and that globalist forces, the CHICOMs and others, are financing the left in an attempt to overthrow, an attempt for just the federal government to come back into being and not be a globalist viceroy.
[00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.044]  We're globalist governor.
[00:07:03.905 --> 00:07:08.928]  Also the exact same thing is being said because we're all looking at the same page, the same information, the same truth.
[00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:17.635]  Former CIA officer in counterterrorism warns leftist violence is going to get very, very bad over the next two years that we're in the middle of a civil war inside the government.
[00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:36.851]  That leftist forces are trying to create a physical civil war and that Antifa and others have been lazing police departments, that is preparing, doing dry run attacks to have a massive rollout and mass blood in the streets, decapitating local government ahead of a coup to remove Trump at the federal level.
[00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:43.899]  And then they're going to try to activate mainly black communities that the left has been trying to brainwash into burning down cities.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.242]  And that's actually come out in Alexander Soros documents that we got two years ago.
[00:07:49.622 --> 00:07:55.024]  And that ties into another big article here today admitting that Netflix is trying to create racial division.
[00:07:55.064 --> 00:07:57.385]  So is so is all of the Hollywood combine.
[00:07:57.785 --> 00:07:59.726]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:07:59.766 --> 00:08:02.267]  Yes, we've been beating the globalists so far.
[00:08:03.547 --> 00:08:15.716]  All over the world in nationalism and populism coming back, but that doesn't mean that they don't have a major left hook ready for us and aren't planning all sorts of violence and basically asymmetrical warfare.
[00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:22.822]  Now Paul Joseph Watson wrote about this for newswars.com and infowars.com and also on his site he has now.
[00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:24.842]  That is summit.news.
[00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:25.823]  Very good website.
[00:08:26.363 --> 00:08:29.344]  That's former CIA officer who warns leftist violence is going to get very, very bad.
[00:08:29.364 --> 00:08:31.204]  You need to share this via email.
[00:08:31.544 --> 00:08:32.604]  Share it via text message.
[00:08:32.684 --> 00:08:33.965]  Get it past the censors.
[00:08:34.285 --> 00:08:35.005]  This is important.
[00:08:35.305 --> 00:08:45.187]  Former CIA officer Kevin Shipp, who also worked in the same area of counterterrorism, warns that this is part of a larger premeditated plan that is going to be intensifying in the next 18 months to two years.
[00:08:45.528 --> 00:08:47.428]  Let's go ahead and roll a piece of the detailed report.
[00:08:47.608 --> 00:08:50.509]  It's an hour-long interview at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:50.829]  Here it is.
[00:08:51.856 --> 00:08:54.919]  What do you think people should do with what's going on?
[00:08:55.259 --> 00:08:58.182]  What's the danger for we the people in all this?
[00:08:58.362 --> 00:09:00.984]  I mean, you say there's going to be a rough and wild summer.
[00:09:01.004 --> 00:09:04.648]  You know, you got Donald Trump making sure all Americans are armed.
[00:09:05.789 --> 00:09:07.931]  And what's the danger for we the people?
[00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:25.590]  The danger for we the people right now is the dark left and dark left violence because as these arrests these indictments first of all begin to come out and as the players are called out the violence on I call it the dark left is going to increase
[00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:26.430]  Yes.
[00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:45.059]  There's going to be a lot of violence coming from the left in the next year or two.
[00:09:45.179 --> 00:10:07.452]  Americans, this is one of the reasons that they need to exercise their Second Amendment right, which I do quite a bit actually, is because of what the left is going to do with these findings and the fact that this could be the death knell for what is now the Democratic Party and certainly the death knell of this coup and the death knell of the dark left's attempt to take over our Constitution and culture.
[00:10:07.472 --> 00:10:09.273]  They're going to see that and they're going to bring
[00:10:10.114 --> 00:10:13.544]  Exponentially bring up their violence and Americans need to arm themselves.
[00:10:13.564 --> 00:10:15.248]  They need to protect themselves against that
[00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:27.098]  Speaking of defending yourself against violence, there is a unedited 18-minute video up on InfoWars.com that we cannot show you here because it would take hours to bleep out all the cuss words.
[00:10:27.698 --> 00:10:40.466]  But we do have a short video we're going to play, next segment, of the young reporter being viciously attacked by Antifa and knocking down six of them before the police come over and arrest Antifa.
[00:10:41.306 --> 00:10:49.888]  Who literally are a bunch of live action role players out in the real world until they run into patriots and get knocked on their asses.
[00:10:50.368 --> 00:10:53.189]  So, a journalist defending himself against anti-femob attack?
[00:10:54.229 --> 00:10:57.830]  Believe me, this is a video that you want to watch.
[00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.230]  If you're a radio listener, it's on Infowars.com.
[00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.911]  We're going to come back and get into that report.
[00:11:03.251 --> 00:11:04.091]  But let's pull back here.
[00:11:06.187 --> 00:11:07.928]  Yes, they have the meth heads.
[00:11:08.128 --> 00:11:18.974]  Yes, the left has all the entitled professors and all the entitled people that thought they'd be the ruling class, that thought that they would rule America, that thought that this was their time under Hillary to make their move and take over.
[00:11:20.255 --> 00:11:25.958]  But now, because it's failed in going down the proverbial historical drainage ditch into the gutter,
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.103]  They are getting even more angry and more pissed.
[00:11:30.143 --> 00:11:34.326]  But emblematically, look at Hillary, evil and crone-like.
[00:11:35.067 --> 00:11:37.409]  Look at Obama, a Mr. Trendy Nobody.
[00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.013]  Look at Biden, who can hardly talk and slurs his words.
[00:11:42.073 --> 00:11:44.495]  He's on so many drugs and so many medications.
[00:11:45.316 --> 00:11:47.998]  These are decadent, narcissistic drug addicts.
[00:11:48.579 --> 00:11:49.660]  They're easy to beat.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.641]  You just have to call their bluff.
[00:11:52.142 --> 00:12:01.249]  So here's old man Joe, nothing against being an old man, but he's the one always saying he can kick Trump's ass, slurs his way through first speech as presidential candidate.
[00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:05.352]  So this is the sleepy, creepy, weak Joe Biden.
[00:12:05.372 --> 00:12:08.374]  This is the best they can muster against Trump.
[00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:08.735]  Here it is.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:18.329]  All my time in public life since I've gotten involved, the country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, and hedge fund managers.
[00:12:19.169 --> 00:12:21.512]  If the enterprise hit hard times, everybody took a hit.
[00:12:22.413 --> 00:12:30.340]  Union workers, the UAW took incredible cuts in their future and their pensions and the like to get GM working.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.242]  They also got that last year.
[00:12:33.703 --> 00:12:34.563]  I want to start this over.
[00:12:34.763 --> 00:12:38.505]  Today, I want to tell you welcome to McDonald's.
[00:12:38.545 --> 00:12:40.365]  My name is Joe Biden.
[00:12:40.385 --> 00:12:41.246]  May I help you?
[00:12:41.266 --> 00:12:46.688]  I stole $2 billion in Ukraine from my son and $3 billion from the Chinese that bought me.
[00:12:47.028 --> 00:12:47.948]  But that's okay.
[00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.309]  I told you I'm against Wall Street bankers.
[00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:56.091]  That's why 98% of the Wall Street banker money went to Hillary and none of it went to Trump.
[00:12:56.631 --> 00:13:00.834]  And that's why, that's why I get all the big Wall Street money and Trump don't.
[00:13:01.275 --> 00:13:03.136]  But I think you're stupid like me.
[00:13:03.156 --> 00:13:08.761]  In fact, maybe Hillary takes on kind of an urban accent when she's in front of blacks.
[00:13:09.201 --> 00:13:10.222]  So does AOC.
[00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:14.905]  So maybe he just thinks that these union workers are mentally retarded.
[00:13:15.366 --> 00:13:16.066]  Maybe that's why.
[00:13:16.086 --> 00:13:17.668]  I'm not making fun of retarded people.
[00:13:18.068 --> 00:13:19.329]  I'm really worried about Biden.
[00:13:19.349 --> 00:13:20.990]  Did he just have a big stroke?
[00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:24.713]  He's up to terrorists about Wall Street?
[00:13:24.733 --> 00:13:25.554]  Let's go back to him.
[00:13:26.428 --> 00:13:35.143]  All my time in public life since I've gotten involved, the country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, and hedge fund managers.
[00:13:35.984 --> 00:13:38.308]  If the enterprise hit hard times, everybody took a hit.
[00:13:39.228 --> 00:13:47.155]  Union workers, the UAW took incredible cuts in their future and their pensions and the like to get GM working.
[00:13:47.315 --> 00:13:52.420]  They also got that last year and tried to cut wages or freeze wages for their people.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.363]  Right today, the same is happening in big hospital systems.
[00:13:56.383 --> 00:13:57.644]  You've got to rethink.
[00:13:58.465 --> 00:14:01.667]  How we define what constitutes a successful economy.
[00:14:02.067 --> 00:14:05.309]  Folks in America don't think their children are going to have the same standard of living they had.
[00:14:05.709 --> 00:14:07.370]  The same standard we may have.
[00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.531]  Dignity be maintained.
[00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:10.552]  I got beer from the Chinese!
[00:14:10.572 --> 00:14:11.192]  Why they do that?
[00:14:11.392 --> 00:14:17.456]  It means investing much more in medical research to conquer devastating diseases like cancer and addiction.
[00:14:17.516 --> 00:14:19.076]  And then to kill the baby after they born.
[00:14:19.116 --> 00:14:21.658]  God bless you all and may God protect our troops.
[00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:23.479]  The troops are swoops.
[00:14:24.139 --> 00:14:25.220]  God protect our swoops.
[00:14:27.489 --> 00:14:29.351]  I mean, that's literally not a manipulated video.
[00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:31.392]  If you're a radio listener, it's even worse watching it.
[00:14:31.693 --> 00:14:34.435]  Because he has to put on that tough guy fake talk act all the time.
[00:14:34.635 --> 00:14:35.576]  Porky Pig meets PCP.
[00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:50.031]  Oh, by the way, when we come back, we'll also get into all the big, massive reports coming out in the Wall Street Journal and Fox News.
[00:14:50.171 --> 00:14:51.792]  Everything you already heard here years ago.
[00:14:52.432 --> 00:14:58.273]  That Joe Biden got $3 billion through his sons for the Chinese government.
[00:14:59.313 --> 00:15:00.714]  Directly from the Chai Cops.
[00:15:00.874 --> 00:15:07.595]  I mean, arrest him, indict his ass, haul him up in front of a jury, and then give him
[00:15:09.881 --> 00:15:11.801]  The penalty you get for traitors.
[00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:17.683]  Seriously, if this country's ever going to heal, we need to have due process and it needs to be carried out.
[00:15:18.623 --> 00:15:21.883]  And then Joe Biden needs to be led to the gallows pole.
[00:15:22.784 --> 00:15:24.604]  After conviction, I wish no violence against him.
[00:15:24.944 --> 00:15:25.804]  That would turn him into a martyr.
[00:15:26.224 --> 00:15:28.685]  I want him like the Nazis at Nuremberg.
[00:15:29.105 --> 00:15:30.365]  I want him given a trial.
[00:15:31.245 --> 00:15:32.966]  And I want him and Hillary and all the rest of them.
[00:15:32.986 --> 00:15:33.306]  You know what?
[00:15:33.686 --> 00:15:34.526]  Let me be magnanimous.
[00:15:34.586 --> 00:15:35.126]  I don't want that.
[00:15:35.326 --> 00:15:36.166]  That'd make him a martyr too.
[00:15:36.446 --> 00:15:39.167]  How about a nice prison sentence for you?
[00:15:40.302 --> 00:15:42.503]  How about we send him to a Chinese slave work camp?
[00:15:43.383 --> 00:15:44.924]  Always running his mouth against America.
[00:15:45.564 --> 00:15:46.905]  Hello, I'm Joe Biden.
[00:15:47.365 --> 00:15:51.527]  I've been selling America out for a long time, and I'm gonna keep doing it.
[00:15:52.047 --> 00:16:00.470]  When we come back, watch a crowd of wraith-like, what appear to be meth-mouthed bandits attack a reporter and get their asses kicked.
[00:16:03.512 --> 00:16:07.433]  Ladies and gentlemen, this fight against the globalists has been like a 12-round
[00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:16.140]  Boxing match that's got more like a hundred rounds and I'd say we're in about the 85th round right now.
[00:16:17.219 --> 00:16:20.782]  Now, just today, I'm shooting this report on Friday afternoon.
[00:16:21.643 --> 00:16:30.931]  We've had really serious sabotage and attacks behind the scenes, and I've decided not to give the specifics of it for reasons that I can't disclose at this time.
[00:16:31.011 --> 00:16:39.858]  But the fact that President Trump's getting the country back, the fact that nationalists are getting elected all over the world, the fact that we're now aware of the threat of radical Islam,
[00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:48.863]  The fact that all of this is going on is really making the establishment very, very angry.
[00:16:49.544 --> 00:16:59.809]  It just came out today that Ilhan Omar, the authoritarian Somali that admits she hates America, called up and threatened Jack Dorsey and said, how dare you keep Trump on Twitter?
[00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:04.552]  He criticized me and showed my clips basically praising radical Islam.
[00:17:05.412 --> 00:17:07.654]  And Dorsey explained to her, well, we have free speech in this country.
[00:17:08.376 --> 00:17:21.822]  Well, the truth is, behind the scenes, if you're not President Trump, these types of phone calls and open calls for us to be censored in Congress have had the desired effect of them trying to curtail us and cut us down to nothing.
[00:17:22.183 --> 00:17:25.204]  They're even going after our basic operations center.
[00:17:26.405 --> 00:17:29.406]  They're going after our actual servers, our infrastructure.
[00:17:29.506 --> 00:17:31.267]  But we have redundancy built in.
[00:17:31.827 --> 00:17:37.110]  But that costs a lot of money to have people working overtime to keep our systems in place.
[00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:51.914]  So, in the final equation, if you want to see the globalists defeated, and if you want to see the deep state prosecuted that we're inches away from, if you want to see the tide totally turned, it takes money to prosecute an information war.
[00:17:52.254 --> 00:17:53.994]  We have truth, they have lies.
[00:17:54.614 --> 00:17:58.495]  The truth is more powerful than lies, but they have globalist dirty money.
[00:17:58.936 --> 00:18:00.256]  Fiat Federal Reserve money.
[00:18:00.896 --> 00:18:04.137]  So, I'm launching this weekend, for one week,
[00:18:05.296 --> 00:18:05.836]  New sales.
[00:18:05.916 --> 00:18:08.017]  We're having to end the t-shirt sale 50% off.
[00:18:08.537 --> 00:18:12.318]  We're having to end the sale on a free bottle of Knockout with Brain Force Plus.
[00:18:12.358 --> 00:18:13.379]  That ends in just a couple days.
[00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:17.980]  But we're launching two new super specials right now.
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.321]  Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:18:20.256 --> 00:18:37.146]  Which is the ultimate bone broth, strongest bone broth formula with chaga mushroom, with concentrated turmeric, with all sorts of other key ingredients known to fight inflammation, known to be antioxidants, known to be good for your joints, your bones, your eyes, everything.
[00:18:37.426 --> 00:18:40.267]  And then organic concentrated chicken broth.
[00:18:40.308 --> 00:18:45.090]  Everybody knows that, you know, when you got the flu or whatever, that chicken broth, for whatever reason, has that essence that's good.
[00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.751]  This is
[00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:51.536]  Like dozens and dozens of bowls of chicken broth, each serving without all the calories.
[00:18:52.177 --> 00:18:53.578]  Bone broth is amazing.
[00:18:53.798 --> 00:18:55.980]  Everybody knows its attributes for thousands of years.
[00:18:56.321 --> 00:18:57.362]  It's the hottest item out there.
[00:18:58.365 --> 00:19:05.850]  We went out a few years ago and looked at all the top-selling, best-rated brands and said, let's make it even stronger and even better for a low price.
[00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:09.153]  Because most places mark them up five, six, seven times.
[00:19:09.573 --> 00:19:10.174]  We mark it up 150%.
[00:19:10.214 --> 00:19:14.116]  When we have a discount, we only mark it up 100%.
[00:19:14.897 --> 00:19:19.320]  But ladies and gentlemen, this is only marked up about 65% right now.
[00:19:19.881 --> 00:19:24.124]  You can get Ultimate Bone Broth Formula, which is low in stock.
[00:19:24.764 --> 00:19:28.808]  For only $19.95 at Infowarstore.com.
[00:19:29.309 --> 00:19:30.630]  Experience it for yourself.
[00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:31.471]  It tastes okay.
[00:19:31.791 --> 00:19:37.136]  But if you mix it in with whey, if you mix it in with some fruit, if you mix it in with some milk and things, it tastes great.
[00:19:37.637 --> 00:19:38.318]  Drink it down.
[00:19:38.538 --> 00:19:40.500]  Great post-workout.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.281]  Great meal replacement.
[00:19:42.662 --> 00:19:43.463]  This is really it.
[00:19:43.863 --> 00:19:45.405]  Ultimate bone broth formula.
[00:19:46.325 --> 00:19:50.468]  50% off the already discounted price at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:50.688 --> 00:20:00.535]  We've got another special there as well that I don't have time to tell you about, but while you're on the site, look for the Buy Survival Shield X2 and get X3 absolutely free.
[00:20:00.835 --> 00:20:01.796]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:09.081]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:29.757]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:48.426 --> 00:20:51.588]  Alright, let's get serious here, folks.
[00:20:51.628 --> 00:20:57.390]  These are just some of the reports on InfoWars.com.
[00:21:13.633 --> 00:21:15.474]  And there isn't any directive here.
[00:21:15.854 --> 00:21:24.857]  We actually look at what's happening, what the intel is, our own personal research on the street, all the experts and guests we're talking to as the intelligence emerges.
[00:21:25.697 --> 00:21:29.679]  Okay, so, I don't call Paul Watson up and say, report on this, or I don't tell the crew, report on that.
[00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:33.600]  Sometimes I say, go cover this Trump rally or, you know, go cover this Hillary event or whatever.
[00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:37.802]  Obviously defend the Second Amendment, defend human life.
[00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:40.883]  I mean, if you don't support that stuff, you don't want to work at InfoWars.
[00:21:42.096 --> 00:22:02.615]  But it's totally emerged that Antifa, funded by the Ford Foundation, funded by Soros, Alexander Soros is really taking over now, running things for his dad, that they're planning violence all over the United States and at the border where people are trying to just defend the total collapse that's taken place.
[00:22:03.175 --> 00:22:05.678]  FBI report Antifa activists
[00:22:07.028 --> 00:22:11.412]  Scheme with drug cartel associates to staged armed rebellion at U.S.
[00:22:11.453 --> 00:22:11.773]  border.
[00:22:12.273 --> 00:22:12.894]  And what do you think?
[00:22:13.074 --> 00:22:17.499]  The troops being disarmed and the Mexican government incursions of the U.S.
[00:22:17.539 --> 00:22:17.899]  are about.
[00:22:17.939 --> 00:22:21.463]  It's all about getting in our face, probing, seeing what we'll put up with.
[00:22:22.671 --> 00:22:25.892]  And that ties into all these tweets that Trump has put out about this.
[00:22:25.912 --> 00:22:30.473]  The coyotes and drug cartels are in total control of the Mexico side of the southern border.
[00:22:30.993 --> 00:22:34.854]  They have labs nearby where they make drugs to sell them into the U.S.
[00:22:35.214 --> 00:22:35.694]  Mexico.
[00:22:36.055 --> 00:22:37.595]  One of the most dangerous countries in the world.
[00:22:38.195 --> 00:22:40.076]  Must eradicate this problem now.
[00:22:40.256 --> 00:22:40.976]  Also stop
[00:22:42.011 --> 00:22:46.793]  The march to the United States, which just a few months ago the Democrats didn't say even existed.
[00:22:46.813 --> 00:22:51.815]  Now they have to admit it, and now the Democrats know their own constituents are turning against them over this.
[00:22:51.835 --> 00:22:54.857]  So now they're going, OK, there is a border crisis, but Trump created it.
[00:22:55.577 --> 00:22:56.777]  Of course you did.
[00:22:57.478 --> 00:23:06.421]  If the Democrats don't give us the votes to change our weak, ineffective, and dangerous immigration laws, we must fight hard to vote them out, Trump went on to say in 2020.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.382]  But all of that now dovetails with this latest footage.
[00:23:12.422 --> 00:23:20.385]  In fact, maybe we should put a compilation together of all the times, there's hundreds of these videos, where Antifa walks over and hits a woman in the head with a bike lock.
[00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:24.167]  And then like 20 dudes just grab her and she just disappears.
[00:23:25.108 --> 00:23:33.191]  Like the last episode of Game of Thrones where the zombies climb over the parapet walls and then grab somebody and they just disappear being chewed into pieces.
[00:23:33.972 --> 00:23:36.213]  You see that footage at Berkeley of the woman trying to get into here.
[00:23:37.699 --> 00:23:41.061]  Milo Yiannopoulos speak, and they first hit her, and she's bleeding and crying.
[00:23:41.101 --> 00:23:43.563]  She holds on to a gate, they grab her, and she goes, ahhh!
[00:23:43.943 --> 00:23:48.105]  Into the dark, and they just boil over her, and bruises all over her, cuts all over her.
[00:23:48.145 --> 00:23:52.528]  It's just men stomp her and stomp her, and glee, and other women get in and kick her in the face.
[00:23:54.509 --> 00:23:56.670]  The opposite of chivalry, the opposite of honor.
[00:23:57.351 --> 00:23:58.992]  Treating women like absolute crap.
[00:23:59.732 --> 00:24:02.294]  Bullies, ganging up on people, being anti-free speech.
[00:24:03.712 --> 00:24:09.676]  But then there's the hundreds of videos of one lone man or maybe two men standing up to 10, 15, 20 of them.
[00:24:10.016 --> 00:24:11.037]  Tommy Robinson did it.
[00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:11.917]  Fought nine of them.
[00:24:12.498 --> 00:24:15.860]  Knocked five or six down to the ground before they got on top of him and started stomping him.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.381]  When the police came, Tommy was the bad guy.
[00:24:18.402 --> 00:24:19.662]  Even though it was all on footage.
[00:24:19.682 --> 00:24:21.884]  He was just trying to leave a McDonald's.
[00:24:23.308 --> 00:24:24.389]  Well, now there's new footage.
[00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:28.134]  And boy, let me tell you, the police report's out.
[00:24:28.414 --> 00:24:32.339]  He knocked out four or five more of them after the camera got disconnected.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.302]  They broke the camera, but he got the tape.
[00:24:34.582 --> 00:24:38.026]  The full 18 minutes of video is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:24:38.047 --> 00:24:39.649]  I want to get this journalist on the show.
[00:24:40.189 --> 00:24:40.910]  Wish we had the budget.
[00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:41.551]  I'd try to hire him.
[00:24:42.532 --> 00:24:43.973]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:24:44.033 --> 00:24:46.814]  Journalist defends himself against Antifa mob attack.
[00:24:46.894 --> 00:24:50.476]  Violent left-wing group stunned by YouTuber's response.
[00:24:50.596 --> 00:24:58.400]  Paul Joseph Watson, a journalist, defended himself against a violent Antifa mob attack during a protest at Huntington Beach on Saturday.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:03.523]  The demonstration saw true groups with opposing views on illegal immigration face off against each other.
[00:25:03.923 --> 00:25:07.285]  During the rally, a YouTube journalist who goes by the moniker That's The Point
[00:25:09.056 --> 00:25:09.676]  We're good to go.
[00:25:32.775 --> 00:25:35.216]  Are you guys going skiing?
[00:26:02.421 --> 00:26:03.422]  You guys going skiing today?
[00:26:03.442 --> 00:26:07.224]  I can ask people questions, bro.
[00:26:07.244 --> 00:26:08.424]  Don't put your hand on me.
[00:26:08.524 --> 00:26:09.645]  Don't put your hand on me.
[00:26:09.725 --> 00:26:10.645]  Don't put your hand on me.
[00:26:10.886 --> 00:26:12.726]  You put your hand on me again, it's going to be a problem.
[00:26:13.067 --> 00:26:14.708]  No, what's going to be a problem is when you walk in there.
[00:26:14.728 --> 00:26:15.628]  That's going to be a problem.
[00:26:15.648 --> 00:26:16.489]  That ain't no problem.
[00:26:16.589 --> 00:26:17.169]  Ain't no problem.
[00:26:17.189 --> 00:26:17.369]  Why?
[00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:18.209]  There shouldn't be a problem.
[00:26:18.229 --> 00:26:18.730]  This is America.
[00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.811]  I should be able to talk and walk wherever I want, right?
[00:26:21.071 --> 00:26:22.212]  Isn't that what you guys stand for?
[00:26:22.412 --> 00:26:25.333]  For the freedom and no government and all that bulls**t, right?
[00:26:25.353 --> 00:26:26.374]  No, we're building a wall.
[00:26:27.031 --> 00:26:27.231]  Right?
[00:26:27.511 --> 00:26:28.432]  We're building a wall.
[00:26:28.452 --> 00:26:30.653]  You don't weigh enough, little boy.
[00:26:30.973 --> 00:26:32.334]  You're underage, dude.
[00:26:32.514 --> 00:26:33.115]  You're underage.
[00:26:33.235 --> 00:26:35.536]  Hey, somebody get this child out of my face, please.
[00:26:35.576 --> 00:26:35.977]  Don't touch me.
[00:26:35.997 --> 00:26:36.337]  Let's go.
[00:26:36.357 --> 00:26:36.797]  Let's go.
[00:26:36.817 --> 00:26:37.177]  Let's go.
[00:26:37.277 --> 00:26:37.778]  Let's go.
[00:26:37.818 --> 00:26:38.278]  Let's go.
[00:26:38.298 --> 00:26:38.598]  Let's go.
[00:26:38.638 --> 00:26:38.938]  Let's go.
[00:26:38.978 --> 00:26:39.179]  Let's go.
[00:26:55.148 --> 00:27:07.277]  And then the camera, audio gets knocked off and the camera itself gets knocked off, but the police report says they continue to attack him with clubs, and he knocked another three people down, who all then tried to file charges, but the cops watched the video and arrested them.
[00:27:07.777 --> 00:27:21.547]  One appears to be a man, a woman, well, men and women don't exist, I forgot, whatever Google says today they are, hits him with a club in the head, and he knocks what appears to be a ghoul out.
[00:27:23.239 --> 00:27:24.602]  It's pretty amazing footage.
[00:27:25.103 --> 00:27:26.607]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:27:27.148 --> 00:27:29.113]  And these people are literally LARPers.
[00:27:29.775 --> 00:27:31.298]  Live Action Role Play.
[00:27:32.045 --> 00:27:39.987]  And so they don't meet in the park anymore to beat each other over the head with rubber swords or foam swords or foam darts.
[00:27:40.567 --> 00:27:42.047]  By the way, I'm not knocking anybody that does that.
[00:27:42.087 --> 00:27:45.648]  I've played that with my kids in the woods behind the house with those Nerf arrows.
[00:27:45.668 --> 00:27:46.288]  Those are a lot of fun.
[00:27:46.308 --> 00:27:47.408]  I'm not saying that's bad.
[00:27:47.948 --> 00:27:51.349]  I'm just saying, you don't want to actually come out and do that in the real world.
[00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:55.890]  Like a dude walks into a group of about 30 of you and he's not afraid, probably been in some fights.
[00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.330]  Probably not scared of getting punched.
[00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:02.958]  Uh, and you guys got knocked upside your heads, and it's just pathetic to watch these comebacks in motion.
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.424]  When we come back, Biden to the traitor.
[00:28:07.365 --> 00:28:10.050]  Who, by the way, I forgot he did have brain surgery for a stroke.
[00:28:11.329 --> 00:28:16.193]  And I think he probably had a mini-stroke when he was up there in that speech.
[00:28:16.213 --> 00:28:23.638]  We'll play the audio again for you, where he sounds like a mixture of Porky Pig and slowed down two times.
[00:28:23.939 --> 00:28:25.760]  It's kind of sad that that's the best they've got.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:26.901]  Or maybe it's apathetic.
[00:28:26.921 --> 00:28:27.161]  We are.
[00:28:27.201 --> 00:28:27.701]  We can't beat him.
[00:28:28.022 --> 00:28:34.647]  But please, however you're listening, the globalists are trying to move heaven and earth to shut us up ahead of the election.
[00:28:35.287 --> 00:28:36.868]  And in six months, we'll be in the middle of the election.
[00:28:37.169 --> 00:28:38.690]  That's why they're trying to strangle InfoWars.
[00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:42.133]  Please, tell everybody about every local radio station you're listening to.
[00:28:42.413 --> 00:28:45.977]  Tell people about it aggressively, lovingly, persistently.
[00:28:46.237 --> 00:28:50.781]  And please, tell people, hey, Alex Jones, the forbidden guy, he's still on the air.
[00:28:51.281 --> 00:28:52.602]  Newswars.com.
[00:28:52.622 --> 00:28:53.463]  You go there.
[00:28:53.783 --> 00:28:54.484]  I know you know that.
[00:28:55.345 --> 00:28:56.226]  You're the smart folks.
[00:28:56.466 --> 00:28:59.428]  We gotta get the general public tuned in so they get the big picture.
[00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:03.762]  Number one in the world.
[00:29:43.172 --> 00:29:44.412]  There is a war.
[00:29:44.432 --> 00:29:45.953]  It's happening now.
[00:29:46.433 --> 00:29:48.593]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:29:49.114 --> 00:29:51.394]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:29:51.714 --> 00:29:53.234]  We are the resistance.
[00:29:53.635 --> 00:29:55.375]  We are the InfoWars.
[00:30:02.076 --> 00:30:06.261]  There are a lot of people out there that say they're on the front lines of the fight for liberty.
[00:30:07.042 --> 00:30:07.542]  And some are.
[00:30:09.084 --> 00:30:10.746]  But I'm not doing this to be famous.
[00:30:10.806 --> 00:30:12.448]  I'm doing this because it was the right thing to do.
[00:30:12.508 --> 00:30:15.011]  And let me tell you, I've gotten deep into this fight.
[00:30:15.772 --> 00:30:19.196]  And I've got the globalists pulling out every stop at every dirty trick you can imagine.
[00:30:19.904 --> 00:30:32.074]  But because you've stood with Infowars, because you've spread the word, and because you've bought the products we sell that fund our operations, we are here in the face of the globalist tyranny being more aggressive and more effective than ever.
[00:30:32.775 --> 00:30:33.815]  I just went to D.C.
[00:30:33.896 --> 00:30:38.940]  and bullhorned the president while Jack Dorsey was inside, lying, saying they don't censor conservatives.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.922]  Ilhan Omar is calling for Trump to be banned, for God's sakes.
[00:30:43.603 --> 00:30:44.503]  And we were in D.C.
[00:30:44.523 --> 00:30:52.528]  doing dozens of major interviews and really affecting change and getting the president to go after the deep state with criminal charges, which you heard about years ago.
[00:30:52.748 --> 00:30:54.869]  And now the president's finally getting ready to do it.
[00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:57.051]  We are the real change agents.
[00:30:57.151 --> 00:30:59.332]  We are effective because we tell the truth.
[00:30:59.992 --> 00:31:03.154]  But without you backing us, we won't be here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:03.675 --> 00:31:07.177]  Without you supporting us, the globalists will be able to shut us down.
[00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:13.733]  Please understand that my philosophy is to give you the very best information out there.
[00:31:14.454 --> 00:31:17.896]  And my philosophy with products we sell to fund ourselves is very simple.
[00:31:18.597 --> 00:31:27.523]  Sell the highest quality that I, myself, and my family take, give it to you at a great price so that it's a win-win, so you continue to want to come back and get it over and over again.
[00:31:28.123 --> 00:31:31.625]  We're running two new specials for one week and one week only.
[00:31:32.606 --> 00:31:33.687]  The biggest one ever is
[00:31:35.137 --> 00:31:36.838]  X2, we were able to get back in stock.
[00:31:36.998 --> 00:31:38.458]  Deep Earth Pure Iodine Crystals.
[00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:45.461]  Read about iodine deficiency, how it has lower IQs if you don't have it, boosted IQs, how it's the building block of the whole body.
[00:31:46.001 --> 00:31:47.701]  Just as essential as water or oxygen.
[00:31:48.022 --> 00:31:50.482]  We have the true pure iodine that you can absorb.
[00:31:50.502 --> 00:31:52.563]  About 98% of people can.
[00:31:53.544 --> 00:31:55.784]  And it's just a game changer.
[00:31:56.124 --> 00:31:57.065]  We have it back in stock.
[00:31:57.105 --> 00:31:59.706]  And when you get one bottle of X2, already 25% off.
[00:32:00.386 --> 00:32:01.266]  Already a great deal.
[00:32:04.212 --> 00:32:07.674]  You get a free bottle of X3.
[00:32:08.234 --> 00:32:09.054]  Absolutely free.
[00:32:09.474 --> 00:32:13.536]  Now, we sat out with top scientists and said, could we make X2 better?
[00:32:13.616 --> 00:32:14.937]  This has the deep earth crystals in it.
[00:32:15.017 --> 00:32:15.457]  X3 does.
[00:32:15.737 --> 00:32:25.882]  And they said, yes, you'd have the other two types of iodine in there because a low percentage of people cannot absorb pure iodine, just like most people can't absorb pure
[00:32:26.702 --> 00:32:28.503]  Iodine that isn't atomic.
[00:32:28.963 --> 00:32:29.983]  So again, it's a catch-22.
[00:32:30.724 --> 00:32:32.504]  So we created X3.
[00:32:32.965 --> 00:32:39.207]  Now, X3 is weaker on purpose, because again, some people can't handle the strongest iodine.
[00:32:39.547 --> 00:32:43.029]  Consult your physician before you take it, because this is real stuff.
[00:32:43.869 --> 00:32:49.511]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, get a bottle of X2 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:50.011 --> 00:32:57.433]  Incredibly popular, thousands of five-star reviews, and get a free bottle of X3 so you can experience how amazing it is as well.
[00:32:57.873 --> 00:33:01.134]  InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:33:01.615 --> 00:33:02.715]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:33:06.416 --> 00:33:09.037]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.875 --> 00:33:21.436]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:21.756 --> 00:33:31.043]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:31.123 --> 00:33:34.365]  What do you think people should do with what's going on?
[00:33:34.525 --> 00:33:37.467]  What's the danger for we the people in all this?
[00:33:37.647 --> 00:33:40.229]  I mean, you say there's going to be a rough and wild summer.
[00:33:40.249 --> 00:33:43.932]  You know, you got Donald Trump making sure all Americans are armed.
[00:33:45.072 --> 00:33:47.214]  And what's the danger for we the people?
[00:33:47.907 --> 00:34:16.984]  The danger for we the people right now is the dark left and dark left violence because as these arrests these indictments first of all begin to come out and as the players are called out the violence on I call it the dark left is going to increase to the point where it's going to be a very very bad there's going to be beatings there's probably going to be shootings there's probably going to be shootings at police and the dark left seeing this knowing that this didn't work
[00:34:17.524 --> 00:34:24.308]  I think there's going to be a lot of violence, if you want to call it the left, there's going to be a lot of violence coming from the left in the next year or two.
[00:34:24.448 --> 00:34:44.860]  Americans, this is one of the reasons that they need to exercise their Second Amendment right, which I do quite a bit actually, is because of what the left is going to do with these findings and the fact that this could be the death knell for what is now the Democratic Party and certainly the death knell of this coup and the death knell of the dark left's attempt to take over
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:45.800]  Now, what did I say?
[00:34:58.109 --> 00:35:17.755]  Last year, when Twitter banned me, I said Antifa has announced plans and it's coordinated out of major foundations and out of major universities with stay-behind groups inside the CIA and FBI, not the entire agencies, but those criminal networks, those embed groups, as Trump calls them, the proper name is stay-behind networks.
[00:35:18.815 --> 00:35:36.924]  To target and to get intel through their leftist networks on where law enforcement leadership lives, where members of Congress live, where local government people live that are patriots, and they have actually dreamed up the schemes that they're going to then come to your house or your work and kill you and your family.
[00:35:38.186 --> 00:35:41.328]  Now, of course, this is not going to go too well when they send the meth heads to do it.
[00:35:42.188 --> 00:35:43.349]  They're not meant to do well.
[00:35:43.389 --> 00:35:45.470]  They're the decoys, like spies like us.
[00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:51.192]  There will be some targeted real assassination that takes place, carried out by professionals.
[00:35:51.913 --> 00:35:55.214]  And that's why folks need to be very concerned about this.
[00:35:55.274 --> 00:36:02.178]  Now, remember, they had Lester Holt and all the rest of the usual suspects read-edited
[00:36:03.058 --> 00:36:07.761]  The statements I said on air, they didn't play audio, they didn't show video, because it would have been so edited.
[00:36:08.102 --> 00:36:10.844]  Like word salad, made up, or like the refrigerator magnets.
[00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:13.866]  Or you could cut stuff out of a magazine and say whatever you want.
[00:36:14.306 --> 00:36:22.852]  Magazine may, you know, just be an article about gardening, but you could probably, you know, cut the words into anything you wanted.
[00:36:22.872 --> 00:36:24.673]  A ransom note, anything.
[00:36:26.014 --> 00:36:27.255]  And remember, it was a big national story.
[00:36:27.335 --> 00:36:29.717]  Jones says attack the media with battle rifles.
[00:36:30.595 --> 00:36:38.078]  No, I said Antifa says they're coming to your house, just like they did Tucker Carlson, they threatened to kill his wife, and you better have your battle rifle next to your bed.
[00:36:39.859 --> 00:36:40.579]  I mean, seriously.
[00:36:41.379 --> 00:36:49.482]  You better have your firearms ready and secured, and you better have a plan of what you're going to do.
[00:36:51.263 --> 00:36:58.426]  And if you see the Antifa bust in your door, come in your house, you are under bodily harm threat, and you have to defend yourself.
[00:36:59.721 --> 00:37:06.425]  So you better think about the type of ammunition you have, so the bullets don't go into your neighbor's house when they go through the Antifa scum.
[00:37:07.706 --> 00:37:09.467]  So this is the real world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:10.927 --> 00:37:13.409]  This is what's actually unfolding.
[00:37:13.869 --> 00:37:18.572]  And all the different killing of police, all the different stuff you saw under Obama,
[00:37:19.454 --> 00:37:25.936]  That was a prelude to try to get them to capitulate to globalist control of the federal government at that time under Obama's control.
[00:37:26.577 --> 00:37:34.880]  And Loretta Lynch had the Strong Cities Initiative to literally put the police of the country under UN control.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:35.900]  That's mainstream mish.
[00:37:37.213 --> 00:37:38.113]  You can't make that up.
[00:37:38.834 --> 00:37:40.734]  This is Red Dawn-level garbage.
[00:37:41.555 --> 00:37:48.877]  Pipe-dreamed out of Bill Ayers and these people who planned this back in the 60s and 70s, and now they tried race war under Obama.
[00:37:48.977 --> 00:37:49.517]  It failed.
[00:37:50.298 --> 00:37:57.260]  And again, it came out in all the documents and all the statements and all the books and all the WikiLeaks that that was their plan.
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.581]  A bold, insane plan.
[00:37:59.621 --> 00:38:00.041]  And guess what?
[00:38:00.101 --> 00:38:00.781]  It's failed.
[00:38:00.821 --> 00:38:02.382]  And their coup against Trump has failed.
[00:38:03.578 --> 00:38:07.363]  But it doesn't mean that just because these rattlesnakes are down, they're out.
[00:38:08.124 --> 00:38:14.152]  They are more dangerous, and more vicious, and more wild-eyed than they've ever been.
[00:38:15.354 --> 00:38:17.297]  So you just heard the clip there.
[00:38:18.269 --> 00:38:19.651]  That's the power players!
[00:38:34.295 --> 00:38:37.076]  And of course, that's the reality that we're facing.
[00:38:37.096 --> 00:38:37.876]  That was Kevin Schipp.
[00:38:38.276 --> 00:38:46.139]  We have joining us another counterterrorism specialist, former with the CIA, Larry C. Johnson, next hour, getting into all of this.
[00:38:46.179 --> 00:38:51.040]  And he concurs and says the same thing, because this is what Antifa says they're doing.
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:55.302]  Now remember, we pushed to get Antifa listed as a terrorist organization.
[00:38:56.926 --> 00:38:59.367]  They threaten violence, they carry out violence for political aims.
[00:38:59.407 --> 00:39:00.447]  They are the definition of it.
[00:39:00.847 --> 00:39:01.607]  They're coordinated.
[00:39:02.568 --> 00:39:06.829]  They are just the kind of brown shirts or the SA of the wider evil.
[00:39:07.529 --> 00:39:15.592]  And Paul Joseph Watson has that article, FBI report, anti-vax activists schemed with drug cartel associates to staged armed rebellion at U.S.
[00:39:15.632 --> 00:39:15.892]  border.
[00:39:16.352 --> 00:39:17.112]  Now think about that.
[00:39:17.152 --> 00:39:19.873]  That's a nationwide alert by the FBI.
[00:39:20.353 --> 00:39:27.940]  Shane, they've been surveilling Antifa leadership and they're planning to work with MS-13 and other cartels to even carry out violence against law enforcement.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:36.227]  And what did I say a year ago in that same 35-minute video that scared Lester Holt and scared NBC and ABC and CBS and every channel?
[00:39:36.807 --> 00:39:38.429]  Said, Jones says kill the media.
[00:39:38.449 --> 00:39:39.269]  Jones says violence.
[00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:40.410]  Jones is dangerous.
[00:39:41.311 --> 00:39:42.412]  He's got to be taken off the air.
[00:39:42.472 --> 00:39:43.313]  Said no such thing.
[00:39:44.113 --> 00:39:47.516]  I said MS-13 is the auxiliary hitman
[00:39:48.297 --> 00:40:06.903]  For the Democratic Party, Antifa or the Useful Idiot cover story, and there's going to be other multinational forces, EU, German, sheep-dipped intelligence operatives, who are going to blow up federal buildings, just like last time, just like 95, who are going to carry out targeted assassinations.
[00:40:07.303 --> 00:40:09.364]  And people always go, what's this anti-German thing?
[00:40:09.504 --> 00:40:10.264]  It's not anti-German.
[00:40:11.024 --> 00:40:14.986]  The globalist forces at the end of World War II ended up taking over Germany.
[00:40:15.894 --> 00:40:17.517]  And setting up Hitler's plan for an EU.
[00:40:18.138 --> 00:40:23.588]  They used Germans because they were basically political slaves to build NASA and build the spy grids and do all of it.
[00:40:23.928 --> 00:40:27.534]  And so, just like we used the British to spy on Trump, that is the globalists too.
[00:40:28.732 --> 00:40:29.212]  The U.S.
[00:40:29.272 --> 00:40:31.113]  uses foreign governments to spy on their citizens.
[00:40:31.833 --> 00:40:33.813]  Our government then spies on the German citizens.
[00:40:34.154 --> 00:40:34.854]  That's how it works.
[00:40:34.874 --> 00:40:45.657]  And I'm just telling you from experience and studying it, that we're going to deal in this country, just like we did with the Jekyll, who was obviously involved in the killing and assassination as well, with foreign hitmen in America.
[00:40:46.057 --> 00:40:48.758]  MS-13, EU intelligence operatives.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.862]  Middle Eastern intelligence operatives, mercenaries, you name it.
[00:40:54.922 --> 00:41:02.105]  They have assembled an army and they are planning in one night, in the future, to try to decapitate the government.
[00:41:02.125 --> 00:41:05.587]  They will blow up the White House with concerted truck bomb attacks.
[00:41:05.907 --> 00:41:07.207]  They will blow up Congress.
[00:41:07.247 --> 00:41:08.828]  They will kill Republicans at retreats.
[00:41:09.068 --> 00:41:10.569]  They will blow up Republican trains.
[00:41:10.809 --> 00:41:12.689]  They will attack Republican baseball games.
[00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.170]  They will try to kill you and your family.
[00:41:15.391 --> 00:41:15.851]  Period!
[00:41:16.744 --> 00:41:18.265]  Everybody better get the red alert out.
[00:41:18.485 --> 00:41:20.607]  Well, guess what NBC and CNN?
[00:41:21.367 --> 00:41:23.949]  I broke it all first and I'm not proud of that.
[00:41:23.989 --> 00:41:25.350]  I'm saying it's why we're under attack.
[00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:26.931]  We put out the message.
[00:41:27.011 --> 00:41:29.713]  Everybody knows it now and we're not going to be caught flat-footed.
[00:41:30.333 --> 00:41:32.655]  So you go ahead and try to pull your crap.
[00:41:33.115 --> 00:41:36.197]  You go ahead and try to pull your internet kill switch under the president's nose.
[00:41:36.257 --> 00:41:39.559]  You go ahead because America isn't asleep, dumbasses.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:44.483]  You thought you were going to carry this out with race riots directed by Hillary when she was put in office?
[00:41:44.723 --> 00:41:45.223]  Guess what?
[00:41:45.443 --> 00:41:46.464]  You're not in control.
[00:41:48.545 --> 00:41:57.651]  You are the authoritarians, you've been caught, you're allied with the Communist Chinese, and now the chickens are coming home to roost, and you're in a lot of trouble.
[00:41:58.992 --> 00:41:59.713]  So good luck.
[00:42:00.713 --> 00:42:01.734]  Go ahead and try it.
[00:42:02.374 --> 00:42:03.415]  Go ahead and try to pull it.
[00:42:03.435 --> 00:42:08.478]  You know, they just put up on screen for a TV viewer, you saw it, radio listeners, Hillary is Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars.
[00:42:08.979 --> 00:42:12.701]  She looks more evil in the real world without putting her in Palpatine's outfit.
[00:42:14.042 --> 00:42:15.183]  I think it makes her look lovable.
[00:42:16.462 --> 00:42:17.664]  Pull up real photos of Hillary.
[00:42:17.704 --> 00:42:19.106]  You want to see the face of evil.
[00:42:19.306 --> 00:42:20.768]  But it's her actions that are real evil.
[00:42:20.989 --> 00:42:25.476]  We're going to come back and get into Biden and the Chinese treason that's now breaking.
[00:42:27.537 --> 00:42:28.898]  But this is what we're facing.
[00:42:28.978 --> 00:42:31.180]  This is the real revolution for America.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.341]  It doesn't mean Trump's perfect.
[00:42:32.802 --> 00:42:33.662]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[00:42:33.682 --> 00:42:34.423]  Doesn't mean you're perfect.
[00:42:34.463 --> 00:42:36.205]  It means we're loyal Americans.
[00:42:36.285 --> 00:42:37.286]  We believe in America.
[00:42:37.526 --> 00:42:38.366]  We believe in freedom.
[00:42:38.406 --> 00:42:39.527]  We believe in free market.
[00:42:39.708 --> 00:42:43.711]  We believe in the right to self-defense and private property and the right of the unborn and the born.
[00:42:44.111 --> 00:42:45.473]  And we believe in fighting for it.
[00:42:45.693 --> 00:42:46.834]  And we're not backing down.
[00:42:47.194 --> 00:42:49.776]  And you people think harassing me and everything makes me back down?
[00:42:50.057 --> 00:42:51.898]  I'll quote John Paul Jones.
[00:42:52.859 --> 00:42:56.021]  When the British told him to give up when his ship was sinking, he said, Surrender?
[00:42:56.422 --> 00:42:57.563]  I've only begun to fight!
[00:42:57.803 --> 00:42:58.543]  And he won!
[00:42:58.763 --> 00:42:59.664]  And we're gonna win!
[00:42:59.864 --> 00:43:00.565]  You can feel it!
[00:43:02.637 --> 00:43:11.506]  Globalism is multinational corporations working with foreign authoritarian countries like China to take over other nation states that have open free societies.
[00:43:11.966 --> 00:43:21.395]  They use our open free society to come in, buy off politicians, buy off other companies to merge and create cartels or oligopolies.
[00:43:21.756 --> 00:43:25.900]  Groups of monopolies working together to dominate and control and consolidate power.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.441]  This is how 21st century warfare is carried out.
[00:43:29.861 --> 00:43:39.825]  But nationalists and populists across the world have been awakened to this threat and are taking action to restore control over our lives back to our central and local governments.
[00:43:40.425 --> 00:43:44.126]  This is the fight that the United States is deeply in the middle of right now.
[00:43:44.506 --> 00:43:46.347]  And that's why the globalists who were arrogant
[00:43:46.647 --> 00:44:05.468]  are now panicking and trying to censor InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and my syndicated radio show because they know we've got our finger on the pulse of what's happening and that the President and the Pentagon and others are listening and know that we're telling the truth and we've basically become the modern Paul Revere transmission of this Republic.
[00:44:05.948 --> 00:44:21.258]  That's why it's so critical for all of you out there watching or listening to remember, without you taking action, without you overcoming the censors, without you, by word of mouth, with your human intelligence, overriding the AI censorship, we will be defeated, and this restoration of the Republic could be defeated.
[00:44:21.678 --> 00:44:26.562]  So please keep spreading the word, and whatever you do, remember, we're only financed now by you.
[00:44:27.102 --> 00:44:27.902]  We're in your hands.

[00:45:22.421 --> 00:45:23.981]  The CoQ10 PPQ.
[00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:27.382]  We have the organically derived, and by that it's not synthetic.
[00:45:27.642 --> 00:45:33.064]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic is expensive.
[00:45:33.144 --> 00:45:35.264]  This is the organically derived.
[00:45:35.664 --> 00:45:36.565]  This is the real stuff.
[00:45:36.745 --> 00:45:46.647]  I want to warn you though, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off like 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there were cut off.
[00:45:46.867 --> 00:45:48.248]  It was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[00:45:48.388 --> 00:45:49.468]  Does it cut cleanly like you see in the
[00:45:49.648 --> 00:45:53.010]  It was numb all the way up here.
[00:46:20.109 --> 00:46:21.971]  And, well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[00:46:22.091 --> 00:46:27.297]  But mainly people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[00:46:27.497 --> 00:46:32.022]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks.
[00:46:32.363 --> 00:46:34.004]  That's a six, seven times markup.
[00:46:34.665 --> 00:46:39.469]  We mark it up 150%, then we discount it 20-30% down to $119.
[00:46:39.709 --> 00:46:43.252]  They're still, again, most of the cost is the product.
[00:46:43.373 --> 00:46:44.353]  It's 20% off.
[00:46:44.494 --> 00:46:46.796]  Profitably make funds this operation.
[00:46:47.256 --> 00:46:49.218]  97% reviews.
[00:46:49.238 --> 00:46:50.419]  4.7 power reviews, third party.
[00:46:50.539 --> 00:46:52.420]  Please, go read the reviews for yourself.
[00:46:52.681 --> 00:46:53.802]  DNA Force Plus.
[00:46:53.882 --> 00:46:55.083]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:46:55.183 --> 00:46:57.004]  It costs a lot because it's worth a lot.
[00:46:57.144 --> 00:46:57.885]  It's next level.
[00:46:57.985 --> 00:46:59.286]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:46:59.587 --> 00:47:01.188]  Fueling the human revolution.
[00:47:06.463 --> 00:47:09.072]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:36.591]  So, last year, about eight months ago,
[00:47:58.442 --> 00:48:01.764]  About a month after I've been banned off over 70 major platforms.
[00:48:02.564 --> 00:48:06.907]  Apple, Google, YouTube, Facebook.
[00:48:07.387 --> 00:48:10.108]  That is, they banned those pages I had.
[00:48:15.091 --> 00:48:22.375]  We came out and said, we've done an analysis of Antifub, and what they're saying and what they're doing, and they've linked up with MS-13.
[00:48:22.875 --> 00:48:26.117]  Nancy Pelosi, of course, was coming out saying that
[00:48:28.078 --> 00:48:30.940]  MS-13 was all God's children.
[00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:47.230]  And I said, listen, it's standard operating procedure of intelligence agencies when they're overthrowing a government to use criminal networks inside the country that they've made contact with and recruited with the promise of sharing power once they get into control.
[00:48:49.411 --> 00:48:54.394]  So I'd love to say that I broke all this just because I have a crystal ball in my back room.
[00:48:55.615 --> 00:48:57.156]  Truth is, I actually worked my ass off.
[00:48:58.018 --> 00:49:23.799]  And I do a lot of research, and when I went on air and said they're planning a violent overthrow of the president, and they're going to use MS-13 as the mercenaries and Antifa as decoys, it's because I had 30-something pages of Alexander Soros' command book from 2015 when they tried to cause martial law, and working with Blue City Police, were staging attacks that the police allowed to happen
[00:49:24.793 --> 00:49:27.514]  Show that blacks would engage in race rioting.
[00:49:28.154 --> 00:49:33.316]  But the racist, leftist, Soros people were unable to trick blacks into doing it.
[00:49:35.217 --> 00:49:39.738]  There it is, documents that tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore that would then spread nationwide.
[00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:44.740]  But the globalists are still planning this.
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:50.882]  And now, the mega, super, incredible bombshell, with almost no fanfare,
[00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:58.081]  The FBI has come out six months ago and said that Antifa groups are listed as terror groups.
[00:49:59.402 --> 00:50:00.843]  They are listed on the terror watch list.
[00:50:01.863 --> 00:50:03.824]  Because that's what they espouse as their doctrine.
[00:50:03.924 --> 00:50:06.305]  Anti-free speech and offensive violence.
[00:50:06.345 --> 00:50:08.106]  That's the definition of bad guys.
[00:50:08.766 --> 00:50:09.526]  They wear masks.
[00:50:10.447 --> 00:50:11.087]  So there you go.
[00:50:12.256 --> 00:50:15.557]  Well, now, ladies and gentlemen, the FBI's put out a nationwide alert.
[00:50:15.637 --> 00:50:16.657]  It's gotten almost no attention.
[00:50:16.717 --> 00:50:17.777]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:50:17.997 --> 00:50:18.737]  Went up last night.
[00:50:18.757 --> 00:50:19.497]  We should repost this.
[00:50:19.517 --> 00:50:29.979]  It's in the San Diego Union Tribune that Antifa is plotting, they've been in the meetings, physical attacks on military and police to open the border.
[00:50:30.019 --> 00:50:34.140]  That's the definition of sedition, the definition of insurrection.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:39.961]  It's not saying I'll fight back if you try to forcibly inoculate me, or I'll, you know, this or that.
[00:50:42.115 --> 00:50:44.616]  We're going to stop the country from existing.
[00:50:45.016 --> 00:50:46.377]  We're going to open its borders up.
[00:50:49.019 --> 00:50:59.505]  And Acosta and all these people, AOC, they all run around and say we shouldn't have any borders at all.
[00:50:59.665 --> 00:51:01.226]  This is the plan.
[00:51:02.287 --> 00:51:05.228]  And it's just sensational that it's actually unfolding.
[00:51:05.268 --> 00:51:07.330]  But you learn what really upsets them.
[00:51:08.308 --> 00:51:21.889]  When I laid out that 35-minute video, emergency message to the President, that MS-13 was openly working with Antifa and they were planning to target conservative leadership, nationalist leadership, loyal leadership, patriot leadership, American leadership.
[00:51:23.422 --> 00:51:26.725]  It freaked the hell out of me, because they keep saying, how does he know this?
[00:51:27.325 --> 00:51:28.306]  It's called research.
[00:51:28.426 --> 00:51:30.647]  I don't get handed talking points like you left us to.
[00:51:31.268 --> 00:51:38.053]  Everybody asks, how did I show up and bullhorn the White House about Jack Dorsey censorship right when he was having a secret meeting with Trump?
[00:51:38.653 --> 00:51:40.295]  It's called the force being with you.
[00:51:40.715 --> 00:51:42.356]  Nobody told me to be there.
[00:51:43.957 --> 00:51:45.338]  I said, we must go to Washington.
[00:51:45.799 --> 00:51:47.680]  I must bullhorn the White House.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.281]  I've never done it.
[00:51:48.601 --> 00:51:49.862]  We must bring up censorship.
[00:51:51.124 --> 00:51:53.425]  And it's just so, that's the way God works, folks.
[00:51:53.885 --> 00:52:00.588]  And the left doesn't understand God, because they want to be God, ladies and gentlemen, instead of wanting to know God.
[00:52:02.189 --> 00:52:03.969]  You want to know God, not be God.
[00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:08.771]  The more you know God, the more pathetic you know you are.
[00:52:08.811 --> 00:52:11.052]  But again, all these little narcissistic know-it-alls.
[00:52:11.452 --> 00:52:14.654]  The only reason I point out how right we are is because that's why they fear us!
[00:52:15.254 --> 00:52:17.655]  They think I'm inside their head, because I am.
[00:52:19.045 --> 00:52:27.072]  And many of you are inside their head as well, because you know they're criminals, you know their past behavior, and past behavior is the most indicative of future behavior, isn't it?
[00:52:27.613 --> 00:52:28.333]  Everybody knows that.
[00:52:29.835 --> 00:52:31.076]  Leopards don't change their spots.
[00:52:32.297 --> 00:52:41.065]  You know the old parable, the old African parable, of the scorpion and the frog, and the frog's nice and friendly, and the scorpion says, we carry me across the river.
[00:52:42.435 --> 00:52:43.655]  And the frog says, no, you're mean.
[00:52:43.675 --> 00:52:44.175]  You'll sting me.
[00:52:44.196 --> 00:52:44.616]  You'll kill me.
[00:52:44.636 --> 00:52:45.736]  And he goes, no, I promise.
[00:52:45.836 --> 00:52:46.256]  I promise.
[00:52:46.276 --> 00:52:46.936]  Just be my friend.
[00:52:47.536 --> 00:52:48.217]  He says, OK.
[00:52:48.237 --> 00:52:49.197]  And he gives him a right across.
[00:52:49.237 --> 00:52:50.437]  And they get to the other side.
[00:52:50.457 --> 00:52:52.558]  And the scorpion goes, boom!
[00:52:53.578 --> 00:52:55.359]  And the frog goes, that hurt really bad.
[00:52:55.379 --> 00:52:56.059]  I'm dying.
[00:52:56.559 --> 00:52:56.799]  What?
[00:52:57.219 --> 00:52:57.999]  I'm nice to you.
[00:52:58.039 --> 00:53:01.440]  I said, you dumbass frog, I'm a scorpion.
[00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:15.252]  I mean, these people are the worst of the worst, picked by the globalists to sell the nation out.
[00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:23.355]  And then they've got the nerve to point at those of us who they call romantic, they call boobs, they call stupid, because we believe in something.
[00:53:24.536 --> 00:53:25.556]  Yeah, it's called our children.
[00:53:27.077 --> 00:53:28.757]  You don't think we couldn't be evil like you?
[00:53:28.837 --> 00:53:31.178]  We're smart enough to know where that leads, dumbass.
[00:53:32.419 --> 00:53:33.999]  We like having a floor to things.
[00:53:34.039 --> 00:53:34.980]  We like having a bottom.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.180]  We like having chivalry.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:38.221]  We like, leave the women and children out of war.
[00:53:39.295 --> 00:53:43.899]  You know, this stuff got developed out of thousands of years of barbarism and death and hitting bottom.
[00:53:44.199 --> 00:53:47.342]  And once you hit bottom, you want to go towards the light, not towards the dark.
[00:53:47.562 --> 00:53:49.304]  You haven't hit the bottom yet, Democrats.
[00:53:49.424 --> 00:53:49.904]  You will!
[00:53:52.126 --> 00:53:55.109]  Because once you make your next move, we're going to help you, like Christ said.
[00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:59.132]  We're going to tie a big millstone around your neck and throw your ass in the deepest abyss.
[00:54:00.407 --> 00:54:01.528]  Because that's where you go.
[00:54:02.028 --> 00:54:03.109]  That's where trash goes.
[00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:04.650]  I don't take any pleasure.
[00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:07.012]  It's like stepping in dog crap and having to clean it off your shoes.
[00:54:08.833 --> 00:54:12.295]  Now, I already mentioned it, but I'm going to get deep into the report of Biden caught working with the shycoms.
[00:54:12.315 --> 00:54:13.196]  This is real.
[00:54:13.216 --> 00:54:13.956]  This is modified.
[00:54:13.976 --> 00:54:15.617]  This is billions to his sons.
[00:54:15.637 --> 00:54:16.718]  This is state-run stuff.
[00:54:17.018 --> 00:54:20.020]  This is him making decisions as vice president to screw over U.S.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:20.481]  companies.
[00:54:20.521 --> 00:54:22.002]  This is quid pro quo.
[00:54:22.262 --> 00:54:24.483]  This is open and shut, hand in the cookie jar.
[00:54:24.523 --> 00:54:25.024]  This is it.
[00:54:25.904 --> 00:54:29.427]  This makes, you know, the Lacosa Nostra look like little angel cakes.
[00:54:32.386 --> 00:54:34.828]  That's all coming up, but let me tell you about something really important here.
[00:54:35.869 --> 00:54:37.450]  We have the biggest special ever.
[00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:38.871]  It is the biggest special ever.
[00:54:40.172 --> 00:54:51.641]  On Survival Shield X2 that we didn't think we could get anymore, but we canceled the contract because they kept jacking up prices on the 12,000, 7 to 12,000 foot deep pure iodine that nobody else has that has all these incredible effects.
[00:54:51.681 --> 00:54:52.862]  Just experience it for yourself.
[00:54:53.442 --> 00:54:55.424]  There's nothing else like it other than maybe fish oil.
[00:54:55.584 --> 00:54:57.806]  It all synergistically goes together, but
[00:54:58.596 --> 00:55:00.297]  Any red-blooded human really needs this.
[00:55:00.317 --> 00:55:01.098]  We were able to get it again.
[00:55:01.418 --> 00:55:04.000]  And by the way, it's our overall most profitable item.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:12.345]  You know, we sell more knockout sleep than anything else, but that's so low-priced that it doesn't really fund our operation.
[00:55:12.505 --> 00:55:13.426]  But X2 does.
[00:55:13.726 --> 00:55:15.027]  It's got a decent markup on it.
[00:55:15.507 --> 00:55:24.333]  But it's 25% off right now and a free bottle of X3 that has the Deep Earth Crystal source in it as well that we got from another source before I
[00:55:25.694 --> 00:55:27.455]  Got the other guys to back down and put me over a barrel.
[00:55:27.855 --> 00:55:30.937]  And I talked to scientists and they said, why don't you add the other two types of iodine?
[00:55:31.377 --> 00:55:35.620]  So that's all three for tri-iodine, because some people can't absorb pure iodine.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.921]  Most people can't absorb iodine that isn't pure.
[00:55:38.402 --> 00:55:39.102]  That's the big secret.
[00:55:39.122 --> 00:55:40.123]  Most of it's bound in the ground.
[00:55:41.414 --> 00:55:43.955]  Or bound to other things in the environment, so you don't absorb it.
[00:55:44.015 --> 00:55:46.635]  So, a survival shield X3 is weaker.
[00:55:47.255 --> 00:55:59.658]  There was a big debate in the scientific community that we talked to, literal scientists, that even though they can say that C is grass certified, or FDA says it's okay to have X2 as strong as it is, that maybe we should put out a weaker brand.
[00:56:00.098 --> 00:56:01.938]  And people looked at it and said, well, why is X3 weaker?
[00:56:01.978 --> 00:56:03.059]  Well, for kids.
[00:56:04.339 --> 00:56:08.940]  You want to be really careful with iodine because this is such a missing link, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.301]  This is so important.
[00:56:12.142 --> 00:56:17.966]  It's the good halogen that with low iodine, IQs are 15 points lower on average.
[00:56:17.986 --> 00:56:20.128]  Just type in iodine and IQ studies.
[00:56:20.548 --> 00:56:21.889]  You'll get Harvard studies.
[00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:23.971]  You'll get University of Texas studies.
[00:56:24.251 --> 00:56:26.613]  You'll get studies back from the 30s and 40s and 50s.
[00:56:26.653 --> 00:56:30.616]  For a while, the government put it in the salt.
[00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:36.072]  Because people's IQs were just going straight down the tubes.
[00:56:37.213 --> 00:56:38.834]  And there was Goyder and all these problems.
[00:56:38.854 --> 00:56:43.216]  They put a little bit of a cruddy, low-quality iodine in, and my IQs dropped 15 points.
[00:56:43.577 --> 00:56:46.818]  The big swollen thyroid problems, you know, went bye-bye.
[00:56:47.179 --> 00:56:53.082]  And no one will tell you then why there's all these issues now, because we're iodine-starved, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:53.922 --> 00:56:56.004]  We're iodine-starved right now.
[00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:58.992]  And I'm telling you, I'm the same way.
[00:56:59.172 --> 00:57:00.333]  I'm not a big supplement guy.
[00:57:00.633 --> 00:57:03.276]  I know how good they are, but I'll forget to take this for a month.
[00:57:03.336 --> 00:57:04.857]  And I'm like, wait, I feel bad.
[00:57:04.877 --> 00:57:05.378]  I feel sluggish.
[00:57:05.418 --> 00:57:05.878]  I'm gaining weight.
[00:57:06.459 --> 00:57:08.721]  I religiously went back on iodine three weeks ago.
[00:57:09.081 --> 00:57:11.243]  I'm doing the same little workouts I do every week.
[00:57:11.824 --> 00:57:17.950]  I've lost five pounds working out, probably less because I've been doing a lot of on the road stuff.
[00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:19.771]  I've lost five pounds
[00:57:20.552 --> 00:57:21.814]  Working out less, actually.
[00:57:21.834 --> 00:57:23.156]  That's just one of the effects I've had.
[00:57:23.396 --> 00:57:27.862]  You've got to go read the reviews at InfoWarsTore.com from third parties.
[00:57:27.902 --> 00:57:28.823]  I didn't have time to get to them.
[00:57:29.064 --> 00:57:30.586]  But you get a free bottle of X3.
[00:57:32.085 --> 00:57:32.645]  InfoWars.com.
[00:57:32.665 --> 00:57:33.446]  We're all Alex Jones.
[00:57:33.766 --> 00:57:34.386]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:58:01.021 --> 00:58:02.122]  Forbidden information.
[00:58:02.142 --> 00:58:05.003]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:06.184 --> 00:58:11.107]  I just, guys, I just don't think, uh, I just don't think I have the energy today to do fourth hour.
[00:58:11.127 --> 00:58:12.628]  I just don't think I can do it, guys.
[00:58:13.048 --> 00:58:16.250]  Owen, Owen, I'm getting sick and tired of your BS during the breaks today.
[00:58:16.410 --> 00:58:17.911]  Been bitching all day off-air.
[00:58:18.091 --> 00:58:19.312]  I'm tired of being a damn cuck.
[00:58:19.532 --> 00:58:24.535]  Will you just take some of the cuck package that we got here and just fix yourself, man.
[00:58:24.775 --> 00:58:25.235]  Fix it.
[00:58:25.495 --> 00:58:26.095]  I'm sick of it.
[00:58:27.576 --> 00:58:33.362]  Okay, um, I guess I'll try this, uh, Super Male Vitality?
[00:58:33.382 --> 00:58:34.843]  Alright, I'll give it a try.
[00:58:34.863 --> 00:58:37.345]  Hmm, says two droppers, okay.
[00:58:38.026 --> 00:58:39.507]  Super Male Vitality, huh?
[00:58:39.727 --> 00:58:42.550]  I don't know, I mean, I'm not totally feeling it yet.
[00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:44.471]  Let me try this, um, Alpha Power?
[00:58:44.611 --> 00:58:46.673]  From InfoWarsStore.com, huh?
[00:58:47.974 --> 00:58:50.157]  Two Alpha Power supplement pills here.
[00:58:50.257 --> 00:58:52.179]  I guess I'll just try this Alpha Power too.
[00:58:52.259 --> 00:58:53.000]  Maybe this will help.
[00:58:54.041 --> 00:58:54.902]  Alpha Power, huh?
[00:58:54.922 --> 00:58:56.484]  I think I'm starting to feel something.
[00:58:56.584 --> 00:59:01.570]  But this Super Male Vitality Alpha Power combo, I think it's starting to kick in!
[00:59:04.994 --> 00:59:05.514]  Yes!
[00:59:06.395 --> 00:59:07.777]  Yes, I feel the power now!
[00:59:19.552 --> 00:59:20.213]  That's right!
[00:59:22.493 --> 00:59:23.653]  I have been uncucked!
[00:59:24.514 --> 00:59:28.054]  It's the Total Cuck Cleanse at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:28.274 --> 00:59:32.836]  Quit being a cuck and take the Total Cuck Cleanse from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:33.256 --> 00:59:35.096]  First, the Super Male Vitality.
[00:59:35.796 --> 00:59:37.217]  Then, the Alpha Power.
[00:59:37.617 --> 00:59:39.557]  And then the Cuck Cleanse begins.
[00:59:39.957 --> 00:59:45.339]  Take back your male vitality with the Total Cuck Cleanse at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:48.681]  That's right!
[00:59:49.061 --> 00:59:51.904]  Toxic masculinity at its finest!
[00:59:56.490 --> 01:00:00.854]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:26.882]  You know, a lot of folks will ask, Jones, why do you get so excited?
[01:00:26.902 --> 01:00:27.942]  Why do you have so much energy?
[01:00:28.822 --> 01:00:29.603]  The U.N.
[01:00:29.663 --> 01:00:37.365]  and traitors in our own government, countermanding law and the president, are organizing the total collapse of our borders.
[01:00:38.585 --> 01:00:45.967]  As Central and South America plunge into civil war, this isn't Game of Thrones you watch on your couch with your ass getting bigger.
[01:00:46.628 --> 01:00:47.888]  This is the real Game of Thrones.
[01:00:49.329 --> 01:00:50.710]  This is the real world, folks.
[01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:52.511]  How would you not get excited?
[01:00:52.551 --> 01:00:54.712]  See, I'm not living in fantasy land.
[01:00:54.772 --> 01:00:57.454]  And look, I know our listeners are awesome.
[01:00:58.835 --> 01:01:13.764]  It brings tears to my eyes when I walk through an airport and black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, male, female, our listeners are strong, focused, fire in their eyes.
[01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:17.611]  And then I see the left when they attack me in the street.
[01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:19.191]  They all look mentally ill.
[01:01:20.071 --> 01:01:20.972]  You think I feel good?
[01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:23.112]  Well, look at all these mentally ill people.
[01:01:23.653 --> 01:01:24.393]  It's scary.
[01:01:24.433 --> 01:01:25.893]  It's like a zombie disease.
[01:01:29.194 --> 01:01:35.336]  And I think about the incredible work of all of our reporters and all of our writers, and I just want to get their information out.
[01:01:38.037 --> 01:01:39.377]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[01:01:39.417 --> 01:01:42.438]  A new article just went up on InfoWars.com by Paul Watson minutes ago.
[01:01:43.079 --> 01:01:43.899]  It's of Venezuela.
[01:01:44.775 --> 01:01:47.236]  The government running over citizens with armored vehicles.
[01:01:48.297 --> 01:01:51.158]  So if your discretion is advised, next segment we're going to get to this.
[01:01:51.858 --> 01:01:57.460]  Shock video shows government vehicle mowing down Venezuelan protesters.
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.661]  And that's why people are starting to shoot back.
[01:02:01.602 --> 01:02:03.883]  And people say, oh, we shouldn't have an intervention.
[01:02:04.323 --> 01:02:05.564]  I was against all these other wars.
[01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:09.090]  This is on our doorstep in Northern South America.
[01:02:09.691 --> 01:02:15.594]  They're staging with the UN, the border collapsing, and we're under attack.
[01:02:16.134 --> 01:02:20.516]  And I don't like invading countries, but this is... Teddy Roosevelt would have invaded.
[01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:23.978]  Eisenhower would have invaded.
[01:02:29.155 --> 01:02:33.659]  You know, in the old days, we put governments in the Middle East that stabilized things and let women go to college.
[01:02:33.999 --> 01:02:34.900]  That's what Eisenhower did.
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.201]  Now we put governments in that throw gays off buildings.
[01:02:37.642 --> 01:02:40.064]  But then tell us we're gonna teach five-year-olds how to be gay here in the U.S.
[01:02:40.384 --> 01:02:42.005]  It's all just a discordant evil.
[01:02:43.246 --> 01:02:48.230]  So, I'm not saying go to Venezuela because I don't trust the neocons to not double-cross Trump and mess it up.
[01:02:49.511 --> 01:02:51.073]  Or put some dictatorship in there.
[01:02:51.113 --> 01:02:52.434]  We don't need a right-wing dictatorship either.
[01:02:52.754 --> 01:02:54.716]  We just don't need Maduro down there.
[01:02:55.933 --> 01:02:57.915]  Thousands starving to death a week for years.
[01:02:57.955 --> 01:02:59.997]  They ate all their dogs and cats four or five years ago.
[01:03:00.618 --> 01:03:02.620]  They lost 30-something pounds on average last year.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.341]  That was in the news.
[01:03:03.701 --> 01:03:04.442]  Even Reuters reported.
[01:03:06.505 --> 01:03:11.009]  And now you've got armored vehicles from the state running people over and the left will spin it.
[01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:12.491]  Oh, that's a fake false flag.
[01:03:12.891 --> 01:03:13.412]  No, it's not.
[01:03:13.472 --> 01:03:15.775]  I watched all the footage of them burning those trucks.
[01:03:17.213 --> 01:03:18.914]  They stopped those trucks.
[01:03:18.934 --> 01:03:20.396]  They didn't let aid come in from Columbia.
[01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:22.257]  And they burned those damn trucks.
[01:03:23.218 --> 01:03:24.679]  I know false flags when I see them.
[01:03:24.879 --> 01:03:25.940]  Those aren't false flags.
[01:03:28.102 --> 01:03:28.722]  Give me a break.
[01:03:29.002 --> 01:03:32.045]  Oh, the soldiers accidentally set the aid convoys on fire.
[01:03:32.465 --> 01:03:32.745]  Uh-huh.
[01:03:33.726 --> 01:03:34.146]  All right.
[01:03:35.708 --> 01:03:38.310]  It is total bedlam down there.
[01:03:39.871 --> 01:03:42.833]  And the Butterknife Brigade is going to remove Maduro.
[01:03:43.814 --> 01:03:44.194]  It's over.
[01:03:44.575 --> 01:03:45.815]  I predict in two months he's gone.
[01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:49.271]  And we can probably just sit back and just wait for everything to collapse.
[01:03:49.631 --> 01:03:51.832]  The problem is, is it's a humanitarian crisis show.
[01:03:51.852 --> 01:03:54.633]  I don't want to hear about we've got to invade this or that over a humanitarian crisis.
[01:03:54.933 --> 01:03:58.435]  This is a absolute out-of-control situation.
[01:03:58.895 --> 01:04:00.396]  Shots fired all over the country.
[01:04:02.036 --> 01:04:12.901]  Even the poor barrio districts that have been the biggest supporters of the communist government are now the ones being terrorized, firebombed by the government when they protest.
[01:04:12.921 --> 01:04:14.782]  The only people who get food are the military and police.
[01:04:16.067 --> 01:04:21.909]  Well that's not going to last very long because they're running out of all the gold and all the treasuries they have to ship food in.
[01:04:22.649 --> 01:04:25.571]  And pretty soon people are just going to start shooting at any aircraft that land.
[01:04:27.491 --> 01:04:29.032]  And so there'll be no more aircraft coming in.
[01:04:30.703 --> 01:04:40.370]  So that place is circling, it already circled the toilet bowl, it already went down the toilet bowl, and it's just a shame because the country's got so much resources, not just in oil.
[01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:48.656]  That shock footage when we come back, and so much more, and then boy, if you were triggered by Greg Reese's last report, we've got another one that's about to go live on Infowars.com.
[01:04:50.818 --> 01:04:52.339]  You're the only way we're going to move the ball on the field.
[01:04:52.359 --> 01:04:53.220]  Please spread the link.
[01:04:54.161 --> 01:04:56.043]  The true origins of Islamophobia.
[01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:58.025]  It's coming up next segment.
[01:04:58.125 --> 01:04:58.886]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:59.226 --> 01:05:00.788]  Please stay with us and spread the word.
[01:05:07.386 --> 01:05:10.228]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:05:10.568 --> 01:05:14.951]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border, talks about MS-13 and more.
[01:05:14.972 --> 01:05:15.812]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[01:05:15.952 --> 01:05:16.353]  Yes, sir.
[01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:17.613]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:19.575]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:25.699]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sports shirts, all the equipment.
[01:05:25.759 --> 01:05:27.621]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[01:05:27.681 --> 01:05:28.441]  God bless you, brother.
[01:05:28.501 --> 01:05:35.026]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread
[01:05:35.646 --> 01:05:36.767]  You're our only hope, brother.
[01:05:36.787 --> 01:05:38.728]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:41.809]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[01:06:12.017 --> 01:06:17.978]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:39.762]  So, the FBI has disrupted multiple target terror plot by a man who converted to Islam, was planning to attack right-wing events.
[01:06:41.158 --> 01:06:42.118]  We're going to get more into that.
[01:06:42.158 --> 01:06:52.722]  The FBI has put out a national alert confirming they've been inside Antifa meetings with MS-13, planning to kill law enforcement, planning to help break down the border and collapse the United States.
[01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:57.544]  This is just the Bill Ayers-Weatherman program now coming to life.
[01:06:59.501 --> 01:07:01.603]  30 years, 40 years after they first hatched it.
[01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:02.364]  Simply incredible.
[01:07:02.404 --> 01:07:03.705]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:07:03.725 --> 01:07:05.967]  We need to get that article out to everyone you know.
[01:07:05.987 --> 01:07:07.548]  It is so imperative.
[01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:12.012]  Also the new video, journalist defends himself against Antifa mob attack.
[01:07:12.572 --> 01:07:17.657]  Violent left-wing group stunned by YouTube's response.
[01:07:22.861 --> 01:07:23.021]  Now,
[01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:33.534]  I want to get to the latest in Venezuela with armored vehicles running over crowds of people and our own liberal media praising it and saying it's a great thing.
[01:07:33.574 --> 01:07:35.095]  I'd like to praise the Arab Spring.
[01:07:35.615 --> 01:07:40.037]  Shock video shows government vehicle mowing down Venezuelan protesters.
[01:07:40.738 --> 01:07:48.181]  Socialist hellhole teeters on the brink of collapse like a black hole swallows in countless other innocent people.
[01:07:48.221 --> 01:07:49.142]  But this is what
[01:07:49.742 --> 01:07:51.784]  Wall Street and the big megabanks are funding.
[01:07:52.304 --> 01:07:55.466]  Trump didn't get 1% of the Wall Street money.
[01:07:56.127 --> 01:07:57.348]  Hillary got almost all of it.
[01:07:57.388 --> 01:07:58.248]  Am I against free market?
[01:07:58.288 --> 01:07:59.049]  Am I against Wall Street?
[01:07:59.089 --> 01:07:59.269]  No.
[01:07:59.769 --> 01:08:03.052]  But the big megabanks that run Wall Street have moved to China.
[01:08:03.392 --> 01:08:04.933]  They're allied with authoritarianism.
[01:08:06.394 --> 01:08:12.859]  And they want to have socialism for the general public and communism because it ends competition for us.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:15.841]  The big megacorporations are offshore.
[01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:16.762]  They're tax-exempt.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.661]  They don't play by the rules they impose on us.
[01:08:21.742 --> 01:08:22.602]  So here's the report.
[01:08:23.782 --> 01:08:29.305]  A shocking video out of Venezuela shows an armored government vehicle mowing down a group of protesters.
[01:08:29.325 --> 01:08:34.947]  The footage shows demonstrators in Caracas throwing objects at the tank-styled trucks.
[01:08:34.967 --> 01:08:36.648]  It looked like they were made in the U.S.
[01:08:37.208 --> 01:08:41.770]  One of the vehicles then mounts a curb and plows into protesters as they attempt to flee.
[01:08:43.051 --> 01:08:46.352]  Two victims who appear to be seriously injured are then dragged away by the crowd.
[01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:47.473]  Venezuelan opposition leader
[01:08:48.493 --> 01:08:49.493]  Well, I'll just say this.
[01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:18.072]  Mexico is already getting its aid cut and they better stop the millions pouring up here.
[01:09:18.972 --> 01:09:26.195]  Or we're going to have to go into Mexico because they border us and they're allowing this and it's an act of war to flood somebody with millions of people, especially criminals.
[01:09:26.855 --> 01:09:28.776]  Many of them are criminals that we're being flooded with.
[01:09:29.296 --> 01:09:36.259]  So this is a very serious situation and national polls are out showing that Democrats are really upset about this and think it's a big crisis.
[01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:41.981]  So now the Democratic Party is admitting the crisis is real, but trying to spin it all.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:47.863]  And tell everybody that it's Trump's fault as if you have no memory.
[01:09:48.803 --> 01:09:50.424]  Now, I want to go to this report.
[01:09:50.624 --> 01:09:56.507]  Greg Reese did a report last week, early last week, that caused a lot of controversy.
[01:09:57.288 --> 01:10:02.251]  And we're going to repost this new report and the old report from last week up on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:02.291 --> 01:10:03.611]  In fact, I think it's probably already up.
[01:10:03.651 --> 01:10:05.893]  I talked to him during the break about five minutes ago.
[01:10:07.033 --> 01:10:10.956]  So people can see the original report that Gregory's put out as well.
[01:10:10.976 --> 01:10:13.918]  But this is a new report that we're going to premiere here.
[01:10:14.459 --> 01:10:17.060]  And this is the origins of Islamophobia.
[01:10:17.461 --> 01:10:18.101]  And I want to be clear.
[01:10:19.662 --> 01:10:21.263]  There are a lot of Muslims that are nice people.
[01:10:21.604 --> 01:10:23.805]  And I don't think they all want to kill everybody and take over.
[01:10:23.925 --> 01:10:28.609]  But Islam started 1400 years ago in what's Saudi Arabia today, Mecca.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.021]  And Medina.
[01:10:30.581 --> 01:10:32.303]  And it's now taken over half the planet.
[01:10:32.563 --> 01:10:34.044]  And there's about to be 3 billion Muslims.
[01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:38.408]  And leftist media is always defending Islam and covering up for it.
[01:10:38.448 --> 01:10:43.273]  And if you criticize murder, death, sexual mutilation in Europe, you get arrested.
[01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:44.294]  So it's protected.
[01:10:45.055 --> 01:10:46.997]  And so that makes me go after it more.
[01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:49.811]  So Islam needs a reformation.
[01:10:50.771 --> 01:10:56.553]  And by the way, we don't respond to people criticizing us when we criticize Islam by kissing Islam's ass.
[01:10:57.113 --> 01:11:00.554]  We are just trying to be really fair and balanced here to look at what's happening.
[01:11:01.014 --> 01:11:07.796]  But I'm not going to sit here and when Christians get blown up and call it Easter worshipers, we're going to call it Christianity under attack.
[01:11:07.916 --> 01:11:08.297]  It is.
[01:11:08.837 --> 01:11:11.498]  And for every Muslim that gets killed by a Christian, there's probably 500
[01:11:14.038 --> 01:11:14.979]  Christians that get killed.
[01:11:15.579 --> 01:11:18.740]  And so we're going to do what the establishment says we're not supposed to.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:24.661]  They say we're not supposed to say that men can't compete in women's sports and then win every contest.
[01:11:25.402 --> 01:11:28.823]  Transgender athletes smashes four women's powerlifting records.
[01:11:29.083 --> 01:11:29.823]  This is a joke.
[01:11:30.123 --> 01:11:32.384]  You tell us not to, we're going to cover it.
[01:11:32.844 --> 01:11:37.245]  So here's Greg Reese's report that did just go live on Infowars.com.
[01:11:38.005 --> 01:11:38.645]  Please share it.
[01:11:39.005 --> 01:11:40.946]  The true origins of Islamophobia.
[01:11:45.403 --> 01:11:50.345]  Early Christianity was centered on the relationship between God and the individual.
[01:11:51.906 --> 01:12:01.091]  And after centuries of persecuting Christians, Rome created the Catholic Church, declared it the state religion, and changed the Christian doctrine.
[01:12:01.812 --> 01:12:05.894]  Practicing Christianity was now legal, so long as it was Catholic.
[01:12:07.398 --> 01:12:15.724]  There is clear evidence that every people have had their religion subverted from the truth, but none more egregiously than the Muslim.
[01:12:16.525 --> 01:12:24.871]  Before there was any such thing as Islam, there were Sufi Muslims, and they lived in relative harmony amongst Christians and Jews.
[01:12:25.932 --> 01:12:29.775]  The Sufi way was similar to that of early Christianity.
[01:12:30.775 --> 01:12:38.139]  It taught that a personal relationship with God was not only achievable by the individual, but it was essential.
[01:12:38.759 --> 01:12:44.101]  The Sufi poets were philosophers, sharing knowledge and ideas with the community.
[01:12:44.862 --> 01:12:54.006]  And they always described the Prophet Muhammad as a wise man of admirable temperament, similar to how the Christians described Christ.
[01:12:55.922 --> 01:13:05.683]  Hundreds of years later, a much different version of Muhammad was put forth by a priest class engaged in the bloodiest conquest of their time.
[01:13:07.512 --> 01:13:14.037]  They published and distributed the Quran and the Hadith and claimed they were the absolute word of God.
[01:13:15.298 --> 01:13:26.207]  A written ideology forced upon all Muslims that allows an unelected priest class to dictate the word of God and outlaw all opposing views.
[01:13:27.688 --> 01:13:30.691]  The Quran was accused of plagiarizing Sufi poems.
[01:13:31.872 --> 01:13:38.232]  And Sufi Muslims were naturally reluctant to accept the clerics as middlemen between themselves and God.
[01:13:39.775 --> 01:13:43.177]  But Islam had zero tolerance for any opposition.
[01:13:43.797 --> 01:13:50.540]  Libraries were burned, Sufis were killed, and Muslims were subjugated under the new law.
[01:13:51.281 --> 01:13:53.342]  Islam was brutal from the start.
[01:13:54.462 --> 01:14:00.546]  The Quran itself describes how people would pretend to be with Islam because they feared being killed.
[01:14:01.846 --> 01:14:07.129]  According to Islam, Muhammad himself had dozens killed for criticizing him.
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:15.825]  Many use the words extreme Islam or radical Islam to describe Islamic terrorism.
[01:14:16.526 --> 01:14:20.469]  But a better choice of words would be fundamentalist Islam.
[01:14:21.289 --> 01:14:33.058]  Because if you accept the Quran to be the literal word of God as Islam commands, then waging terror and jihad upon non-Muslims is absolutely the highest path.
[01:14:34.079 --> 01:14:40.867]  Even the most respected Muslim scholars agree that the final chapter of the Quran abrogates all else.
[01:14:41.588 --> 01:14:48.095]  And the final chapter tells Muslims to fight Jews and Christians until they submit as willing slaves.
[01:14:49.136 --> 01:14:58.068]  According to the Hadith, Muhammad loved Jihad so much that he prayed to be reincarnated so that he could fight and die over and over again.
[01:14:58.909 --> 01:15:05.558]  According to the Quran and Hadith, suicidal terrorists who kill non-Muslims are the heroes of Islam.
[01:15:06.619 --> 01:15:13.884]  The Quran teaches that Muslims are superior to all others, and that Jews and Christians are the worst of creatures.
[01:15:14.905 --> 01:15:17.427]  It teaches that women are mentally deficient.
[01:15:18.307 --> 01:15:24.372]  It teaches Muslims to punish non-Muslims, make enemies with them, and wage war against them.
[01:15:25.252 --> 01:15:35.419]  The Quran tells us that Allah granted Muslims the right to rape women and own sex slaves, including children who have not yet reached puberty.
[01:15:35.439 --> 01:15:35.980]  All right, folks.
[01:15:37.489 --> 01:15:38.269]  We're going to go to break.
[01:15:38.509 --> 01:15:39.650]  That's only half the report.
[01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:41.231]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:15:41.451 --> 01:15:43.051]  You're welcome to debate it in the comments.
[01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:44.492]  It's also on NewsWars.com.
[01:15:45.392 --> 01:15:53.696]  The true origins of Islamophobia is up on the site, but we're going to shift gears again to what I said I'd cover, and that's Biden openly run by China.
[01:15:54.276 --> 01:15:55.217]  Will he be arrested?
[01:15:55.677 --> 01:15:56.277]  I think so.
[01:15:57.037 --> 01:15:58.738]  We either arrest all these people or they win.
[01:15:59.058 --> 01:16:00.639]  These are foreign traitors.
[01:16:06.263 --> 01:16:07.224]  Marcos, thanks for holding.
[01:16:07.264 --> 01:16:09.386]  I really appreciate you joining us on this Friday edition.
[01:16:09.406 --> 01:16:09.986]  What's your view?
[01:16:10.046 --> 01:16:10.667]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[01:16:10.727 --> 01:16:11.827]  I appreciate you having me on.
[01:16:11.888 --> 01:16:13.649]  First off, I wanted to thank you for Bonnie.
[01:16:13.689 --> 01:16:25.018]  You've been using it for a while, but I sent a bottle to my mom, and after taking it for a few days, she called me literally in tears, saying that she could see the knuckles on her fingers again and, like, the bones in her knees again.
[01:16:25.038 --> 01:16:25.959]  She was ecstatic.
[01:16:26.019 --> 01:16:32.624]  So, personal thank you to you for that, because anybody who makes my mom's life a little bit easier has a special place in my heart.
[01:16:32.784 --> 01:16:33.285]  Tumor-y.
[01:16:34.204 --> 01:16:36.986]  Curry in India is powerful.
[01:16:37.026 --> 01:16:39.268]  The average turmeric product is about 3-5%.
[01:16:39.368 --> 01:16:39.709]  Ours is 95%.
[01:16:39.749 --> 01:16:42.731]  The strongest curcuminoid out there.
[01:16:43.352 --> 01:16:46.014]  So Advil works great when I've got to twist an ankle.
[01:16:46.374 --> 01:16:49.777]  This is nature's Advil to the next level.
[01:16:50.377 --> 01:16:52.299]  So that's why Bodies is so incredible.
[01:16:52.339 --> 01:16:54.661]  People should really check it out and support the InfoWars.

[01:17:12.238 --> 01:17:12.878]  It's perfect.
[01:17:12.898 --> 01:17:14.079]  But I love God and I love Christ.

[01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:08.773]  Leading competitors at 500, 600 bucks.
[01:18:08.813 --> 01:18:09.513]  These are great deals at 300.

[01:18:11.574 --> 01:18:11.754]  $50 off.

[01:18:13.815 --> 01:18:16.777]  And we have the best deal on food ever.
[01:18:16.797 --> 01:18:18.498]  It's in these high-quality plastic.
[01:18:18.658 --> 01:18:21.419]  I mean, I mean, hell, just a plastic container at Walmart cost us
[01:18:21.519 --> 01:18:25.982]  You know, it's nice, snap-top plastic, high-quality, rubber-made type material.
[01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:30.725]  It's got a two-week food supply in a big tote container.

[01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:41.471]  That is the best deal on high-quality, storable food out there.
[01:18:41.491 --> 01:18:45.674]  And it's great to have one in your garage, one in your car, one at work in case something goes down.
[01:18:45.694 --> 01:18:48.415]  Or you can give it to people for charity or give it to homeless down the road.
[01:18:48.435 --> 01:18:49.316]  It lasts 25 years.
[01:18:49.756 --> 01:18:50.817]  This is the best deal ever.
[01:18:50.897 --> 01:18:56.161]  You have a two-week supply, ladies and gentlemen, that is more than 50% off.
[01:18:56.281 --> 01:18:58.763]  It is at cost.
[01:18:59.343 --> 01:18:58.763]  $67.
[01:18:59.863 --> 01:19:01.004]  That is at cost.
[01:19:01.204 --> 01:19:04.006]  As a promotional, they're doing, because they want you to see how great it is.
[01:19:04.046 --> 01:19:04.807]  It's a loss leader.
[01:19:04.947 --> 01:19:06.388]  InfoWars Life Select.
[01:19:06.488 --> 01:19:06.788]  Buy that.

[01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:11.512]  Contracts they have with other distributors go the lowest.
[01:19:11.752 --> 01:19:13.393]  Us being a private labeler.
[01:19:13.533 --> 01:19:13.994]  It's a private label.
[01:19:14.014 --> 01:19:14.934]  It's the very same factory.
[01:19:14.974 --> 01:19:15.915]  Fresh, high-quality food.
[01:19:16.035 --> 01:19:16.716]  So it's all there.
[01:19:16.736 --> 01:19:16.716]  $67.
[01:19:17.156 --> 01:19:19.339]  Two-week food supply.
[01:19:19.359 --> 01:19:22.763]  And just the container itself, it'll cost close to that at Walmart.
[01:19:22.983 --> 01:19:24.405]  It's also highly reusable.
[01:19:24.485 --> 01:19:27.109]  Each meal is in its own vacuum-sealed packet.
[01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.589]  Amazing.
[01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:30.533]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:19:32.515 --> 01:19:36.661]  But whatever you do, don't let the bullies shut you up and your free speech.
[01:19:37.201 --> 01:19:38.503]  Don't let them silence you.
[01:19:38.603 --> 01:19:39.084]  It's simple.
[01:19:39.584 --> 01:19:44.471]  Wear an Imcol Wars t-shirt, or a Molon Labe shirt, or a Me Michael Wolverine shirt.
[01:19:44.811 --> 01:19:45.392]  They're all there.
[01:19:45.512 --> 01:19:46.073]  Hundreds of them.
[01:19:46.273 --> 01:19:47.495]  They only do this once a year.
[01:19:48.055 --> 01:19:48.296]  50% off.
[01:19:48.336 --> 01:19:49.357]  Get your t-shirts now.
[01:19:49.617 --> 01:19:50.699]  Wear your colors proud.
[01:20:06.815 --> 01:20:09.697]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:10.157 --> 01:20:18.423]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:20:18.784 --> 01:20:19.784]  until 3 p.m.
[01:20:19.844 --> 01:20:21.446]  I'm here live.
[01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:38.091]  And you got Owen Schroer in the War Room, 3 p.m.
[01:20:38.111 --> 01:20:38.451]  Central.
[01:20:38.471 --> 01:20:40.031]  We're about to add some more shows as well.
[01:20:40.631 --> 01:20:41.792]  They'll be announced in the next few weeks.
[01:20:42.412 --> 01:20:45.792]  We also have David Nye doing a great job, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[01:20:46.213 --> 01:20:46.553]  to 11 a.m.
[01:20:46.773 --> 01:20:47.333]  when I come on.
[01:20:48.333 --> 01:20:53.414]  Joining us in the next segment is Larry C. Johnson of CIA Counterterrorism, formerly.
[01:20:53.454 --> 01:20:56.215]  He's come out and exposed the coup plot against Trump.
[01:20:57.122 --> 01:20:58.664]  Years ago, it's now all been confirmed.
[01:20:59.264 --> 01:21:12.658]  And then we'll get his take on what other folks are saying, counterterrorism specialists, about the left's open calls for civil war, the FBI terror alert that Antifa is basically the deep state's decoy for violence, to trigger violence.
[01:21:12.678 --> 01:21:14.039]  We'll talk about that all with him.
[01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:15.440]  But here's really the big news.
[01:21:15.861 --> 01:21:18.864]  I know as an audience and as researchers, you already know all about Joe Biden.
[01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:21.636]  But the general public doesn't.
[01:21:22.157 --> 01:21:23.919]  And, you know, it's a great bait-and-switch.
[01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:25.421]  It's a great diversionary tactic.
[01:21:25.441 --> 01:21:33.872]  It's not like you see in old movies or cartoons where the villain gets caught, and then whoever the hero is that just caught the villain goes, no, actually, he's the spy.
[01:21:34.252 --> 01:21:34.853]  He's the one.
[01:21:36.214 --> 01:21:38.717]  Well, in the real world, that actually goes on.
[01:21:41.266 --> 01:21:54.493]  And so now there's a big Breitbart article up on Infowars.com and Breitbart.com that has a long 20-minute interview that was done on Fox News that goes through all the evidence and these investigative journalists that have looked into this.
[01:21:54.553 --> 01:21:59.855]  But Biden didn't hide this because he thought that the Clintons and people would be in power forever.
[01:22:00.976 --> 01:22:06.659]  Biden, under Obama particularly, his sons got billions and billions of natural gas and oil.
[01:22:06.699 --> 01:22:08.100]  They made hundreds of millions themselves.
[01:22:09.249 --> 01:22:11.971]  They got over $3 billion from Chinese companies to their companies.
[01:22:13.433 --> 01:22:18.777]  Again, the Bidens have made hundreds and hundreds of millions that we know of, and they've got a bunch of offshore accounts.
[01:22:19.898 --> 01:22:24.022]  So if you think Manafort was doing some stuff, he was nothing.
[01:22:24.802 --> 01:22:29.907]  So Steve Hilton, China is funding Biden family businesses with billions.
[01:22:31.823 --> 01:22:46.694]  Hunter Biden, Biden's second son, secured a $1 billion in financing from the Bank of China, an arm of the Chinese government for a private equity firm founded by himself and Christopher Hines, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry.
[01:22:46.974 --> 01:22:49.696]  And again, I've read all the stuff on this even before it came out in Breitbart.
[01:22:50.017 --> 01:22:51.518]  It's $3 billion from China.
[01:22:52.836 --> 01:23:01.964]  Joe Biden is the very definition of a corporate insider, said Hilton, rejecting left-wing and partisan Democrat marketing.
[01:23:02.024 --> 01:23:04.046]  In fact, can we cue up his slurred speech the other night?
[01:23:05.568 --> 01:23:07.289]  Biden is a man of the working people.
[01:23:08.891 --> 01:23:12.154]  He profiled Biden in a segment entitled Swamp Watch.
[01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:24.438]  Kilton added, with Joe Biden, there's a much more worrying relationship with a foreign power, one that represents a vastly bigger threat to America than Russia and China.
[01:23:25.925 --> 01:23:33.610]  So, going over all this, it's a big report, and it links to other detailed reports that break all this down.
[01:23:33.630 --> 01:23:39.774]  This is only one area of the China sellout, directly with the state-owned Bank of China.
[01:23:40.195 --> 01:23:43.016]  And the other companies are direct state-owned facilities.
[01:23:43.817 --> 01:23:47.439]  And state-owned energy companies, technology companies, you name it.
[01:23:47.499 --> 01:23:49.581]  And it's a clear payoff.
[01:23:50.606 --> 01:23:51.827]  It's absolutely a clear payoff.
[01:23:52.688 --> 01:23:56.550]  The Chinese have no rules but screw over America, the Chinese communists.
[01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:58.312]  They do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[01:23:58.352 --> 01:23:59.072]  They make U.S.
[01:23:59.112 --> 01:24:01.094]  companies that move there, give them all their technology.
[01:24:02.154 --> 01:24:08.219]  I was there at bowling last week for his Blaze TV and Sinclair TV show in D.C.
[01:24:08.279 --> 01:24:12.202]  and I told him, I said, no, Apple officially moved there last April.
[01:24:13.102 --> 01:24:14.263]  They officially moved there a year ago.
[01:24:14.283 --> 01:24:19.187]  Reuters reported they had to give all the code keys to everybody's devices to the Chinese government.
[01:24:19.932 --> 01:24:24.655]  And Eric stopped the cameras, had him looking up on a phone, read the article.
[01:24:25.095 --> 01:24:26.115]  He used to be a big stockbroker.
[01:24:26.175 --> 01:24:30.378]  He couldn't believe it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:31.258 --> 01:24:36.341]  The level of the treason is absolutely mind-blowing.
[01:24:37.141 --> 01:24:39.622]  And it's done right out in the open.
[01:24:39.642 --> 01:24:42.084]  So what do you do if you're Biden and the Clintons and you've sold out?
[01:24:42.104 --> 01:24:43.464]  Because they're not Chinese agents.
[01:24:43.484 --> 01:24:44.445]  They just sell it to everybody.
[01:24:44.465 --> 01:24:45.986]  They're just the worst traders you could ever imagine.
[01:24:47.346 --> 01:24:48.327]  As long as it's anti-American.
[01:24:51.468 --> 01:24:51.929]  What do you do?
[01:24:52.009 --> 01:24:57.459]  You then blame Trump and the nationalists and the patriots with what you yourself have done.
[01:24:58.718 --> 01:25:01.299]  It's truly dangerous.
[01:25:01.479 --> 01:25:02.760]  It's it's insane.
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:06.122]  And it's coming to a head right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:06.422 --> 01:25:16.327]  And we're going to look, though, at how the deep state plans to fight back and all these resignations of Rosenstein and of the head of the Air Force Academy and of the head of Gitmo.
[01:25:16.467 --> 01:25:22.110]  I'm told by some folks in Florida in the military that are pretty smart that this is a big, big deal.
[01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:23.991]  We'll get this
[01:25:24.831 --> 01:25:38.940]  Former covert operations anti-terrorism expert from the CIA on next segment Larry C Johnson To give us his take on that before I go to break because I never do this properly And I need to do this properly and people need to listen up to me.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:46.926]  Okay, I Think everybody's noticed that We really try to give you accurate info and have some of the most accurate information out there.
[01:25:47.706 --> 01:25:48.767]  I told you last year
[01:25:50.444 --> 01:25:58.609]  Eight months ago, I got a man from Twitter for it, that Antifa's working with MS-13 and the Democrats as their muscle on the ground to carry out assassinations, you name it.
[01:25:59.069 --> 01:26:00.070]  It's an FBI alert.
[01:26:00.370 --> 01:26:01.351]  They've been inside the meetings.
[01:26:02.352 --> 01:26:03.973]  Specific groups, they're getting ready to arrest.
[01:26:04.093 --> 01:26:05.413]  This is serious, folks.
[01:26:05.433 --> 01:26:07.255]  You see them all over the news saying, kill the president.
[01:26:07.815 --> 01:26:16.020]  This is how the CHICOMS and others are manipulating through the sellouts in our government that wanted to sell the country out.
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:17.021]  That's what globalism is.
[01:26:18.257 --> 01:26:26.519]  So it's very, very, very important that folks understand this is very serious and that without you spreading the word and without you buying the products, we won't be here.
[01:26:26.779 --> 01:26:28.680]  I don't get money from the Chi-Coms or George Soros.
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:40.683]  I fund this operation and all these shows and all these investigative reporters that are in the field confronting Biden yesterday and, you know, Caitlyn Bennett getting 30 million views a month and Millie Weaver getting 20 million a month.
[01:26:40.763 --> 01:26:43.083]  I mean, we're toe-to-toe with these people, okay?
[01:26:43.503 --> 01:26:44.764]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:26:44.784 --> 01:26:46.024]  I'm saying I'm going to fight.
[01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:47.913]  And I need money to do it.
[01:26:48.353 --> 01:26:49.074]  I need a bunch of it.
[01:26:49.774 --> 01:26:51.156]  And I make it real easy to do.
[01:26:51.176 --> 01:26:56.320]  The soils and the food is depleted of iodine.
[01:26:57.361 --> 01:26:59.342]  It's what you build your hormones and everything off of.
[01:26:59.362 --> 01:26:59.923]  You have to have it.
[01:27:00.223 --> 01:27:06.868]  Instead, we get hit with all the bad allergens, which lower fertility, lower libido, and everything else, and cause bone cancer.
[01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:07.289]  Fluoride.
[01:27:08.069 --> 01:27:09.651]  Fluoride's real good for your teeth, nothing else.
[01:27:11.564 --> 01:27:12.706]  The good halogen is iodine.
[01:27:12.726 --> 01:27:14.029]  We have the cleanest X2.
[01:27:14.049 --> 01:27:14.610]  We're able to get it.
[01:27:14.650 --> 01:27:15.572]  Nobody else has this.
[01:27:15.592 --> 01:27:19.260]  Between 7,000 and 12,000 feet, they get it drilling for natural gas.
[01:27:21.957 --> 01:27:30.900]  The stuff's so pure that we had to get a DEA approval just to keep it in a facility before it's then put into the organic oil and delivered to you.
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:31.740]  Then it's totally legal.
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:38.422]  You can get a free bottle of X3 that's all three types of iodine, including the deep-earth crystal, with the pure deep-earth crystal version X2.
[01:27:38.682 --> 01:27:39.562]  So 25% off X2.
[01:27:41.843 --> 01:27:43.184]  I want you to have it and get it.
[01:27:43.204 --> 01:27:44.926]  You can read the thousands of five-star reviews.
[01:27:45.746 --> 01:27:46.447]  98% review.
[01:27:46.627 --> 01:27:47.888]  There's no reviews yet on the combo.
[01:27:47.908 --> 01:27:48.849]  We can show TV viewers.
[01:27:49.269 --> 01:27:51.711]  Thousands of five-star reviews.
[01:27:51.972 --> 01:27:52.392]  4.9 stars.
[01:27:52.412 --> 01:27:54.734]  98% I'm going from memory.
[01:27:54.974 --> 01:27:55.134]  Yeah, 98%.
[01:27:56.355 --> 01:27:57.857]  That's power reviews, third-party side.
[01:27:59.358 --> 01:27:59.718]  4.9 stars.
[01:28:01.059 --> 01:28:04.602]  Our most popular product, because let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:06.004 --> 01:28:08.486]  You start taking iodine, the good type.
[01:28:10.015 --> 01:28:11.637]  And what it does in your body is insane.
[01:28:12.178 --> 01:28:13.680]  You should consult a physician before.
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:19.248]  It's all seen and generally safe, but if you've really been deficient and there's other stuff going on, who knows what's going to happen.
[01:28:19.268 --> 01:28:20.109]  I'm already out of time again.
[01:28:20.169 --> 01:28:22.733]  Sometime today I've got to read these reviews to you, the five-star reviews.
[01:28:22.753 --> 01:28:24.435]  We just printed these off in the order they printed up.
[01:28:24.735 --> 01:28:26.177]  Let me just read one of these to you if I have time.
[01:28:27.785 --> 01:28:29.786]  I started taking this last year, daily.
[01:28:29.806 --> 01:28:34.887]  When combined with water filtration good enough to filter out fluoride, your life will change forever.
[01:28:34.967 --> 01:28:37.087]  Clarity of mind, overall becoming woke.
[01:28:37.668 --> 01:28:43.769]  I don't like that word, but I don't have enough characters in this comment and a way to say what X2, X3 is the next level.
[01:28:44.329 --> 01:28:44.949]  I take both.
[01:28:45.029 --> 01:28:46.830]  Anyways, get your thyroid.
[01:28:48.812 --> 01:28:49.553]  And freak out.
[01:28:49.593 --> 01:28:51.174]  Start taking it ASAP.
[01:28:51.515 --> 01:28:52.235]  Brandon, Texas.
[01:28:52.896 --> 01:28:54.037]  Not joking around here, folks.
[01:28:54.698 --> 01:28:55.458]  Not joking around.
[01:28:56.019 --> 01:28:56.539]  Get it today.
[01:28:56.559 --> 01:28:57.720]  Get your free model X3.
[01:28:58.121 --> 01:29:02.745]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:29:03.166 --> 01:29:06.289]  Why has America been so special compared to other nations?
[01:29:07.489 --> 01:29:10.171]  Why has it become the model of other successful countries?
[01:29:10.512 --> 01:29:11.973]  Why do so many people want to get here?
[01:29:12.733 --> 01:29:17.677]  Because of our constitutional republic and the basic freedoms that were protected for the individual.
[01:29:18.057 --> 01:29:24.463]  Even though we've had a lot of problems, the fact that we were the freest country in the world allowed incredible wealth to be developed.
[01:29:25.163 --> 01:29:26.886]  By the 1950s, the U.S.
[01:29:26.906 --> 01:29:32.474]  had over 80% of the world's patents and over half the wealth and the biggest middle class the planet had ever seen.
[01:29:33.235 --> 01:29:37.201]  It was America that led the way on human rights, not just here, but around the world.
[01:29:38.069 --> 01:29:43.491]  But if you tune into the national news today, like CNN, you'd believe America was the worst place on Earth.
[01:29:43.871 --> 01:29:44.852]  And it's a horrible place.
[01:29:45.312 --> 01:29:45.792]  And why is that?
[01:29:45.812 --> 01:29:53.195]  It's because multinational corporations, working with the Communist Chinese, the EU and others, are demoralizing the nation to break us down.
[01:29:53.735 --> 01:29:57.517]  And to make us not care about our identity, so we can be absorbed into globalism.
[01:29:58.217 --> 01:30:06.600]  But thanks to InfoWars and thanks to the audience of activists out there, we have rebooted Americana and the resistance against the globalists.
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:12.722]  And now Trump coming in and turning the tide and exposing the whole fake Russiagate has them panicked.
[01:30:12.762 --> 01:30:17.564]  Nationalist populists are being elected in South America, in Europe, in the UK.
[01:30:17.904 --> 01:30:20.805]  It's happening everywhere and the power structure is panicking.
[01:30:21.607 --> 01:30:36.352]  That's why Big Tech, allied with the Chi-Coms, the authoritarian EU and others, are forcing the whole Hollywood hate America brainwashing on the public and bringing in censorship in an attempt to block us from completing the take back of the nation.
[01:30:36.792 --> 01:30:38.653]  And that's why, more than ever, you have to remember,
[01:30:39.073 --> 01:30:52.576]  Because of the censorship, you've got to come to NewsWars.com or InfoWars.com to hear what's really happening on the front lines and how you can help, not just save the country, but really the future destiny of the people of this planet.
[01:30:53.056 --> 01:31:02.258]  Because if the United States falls to tyranny and falls to leftist authoritarianism, the Communist Chinese will be the dominant cultural force on the planet.
[01:31:03.311 --> 01:31:18.160]  That's why it's so critical that we understand that Democrats in Congress right now are attempting to bring in more draconian censorship of conservatives and others, while at the same time big tech heads lie to Congress and say they're not censoring when they've been caught red-handed.
[01:31:19.184 --> 01:31:24.549]  This is the legislative branch, and we need to take control of it to restore the republic.
[01:31:24.829 --> 01:31:31.114]  We also have to take control of the judicial, and that takes us to our next spot, the Supreme Court.
[01:31:31.234 --> 01:31:34.177]  Imagine what would have happened if Hillary Clinton would have been elected.
[01:31:34.657 --> 01:31:44.465]  It would have been a death blow to this country, because the Democrats now officially say they want to repeal the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms, and so many other issues.
[01:31:44.525 --> 01:31:47.087]  This nation is still held by a threat.
[01:31:47.828 --> 01:31:53.572]  That's why it's so important to understand that the Democrats are the party of extremism, extreme anti-Americanism.
[01:31:53.932 --> 01:32:00.777]  The Republicans were a bunch of blue blood establishment types, but we've had a populist insurrection that has partially taken it over.
[01:32:01.377 --> 01:32:12.985]  Now we've got to take it all the way over, keep Trump in the White House in 2020, and get more governorships and more state houses across this country to reverse the globalist plan to take down our nation.
[01:32:13.005 --> 01:32:14.886]  And that's why InfoWars is so important.
[01:32:15.226 --> 01:32:16.847]  InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:32:18.008 --> 01:32:21.889]  Tomorrow's news today that will only get through to the people if you spread the word.
[01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:25.830]  Just while I've been out here walking today, I probably shook a hundred hands.
[01:32:26.551 --> 01:32:28.691]  And a third of them said, where are you?
[01:32:28.751 --> 01:32:29.612]  We miss you.
[01:32:30.232 --> 01:32:31.472]  We wish you were still on air.
[01:32:32.372 --> 01:32:36.994]  That's because they were habitualized on YouTube and on iTunes and everywhere else to listen to us.
[01:32:37.884 --> 01:32:40.666]  You have to come to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:32:40.706 --> 01:32:46.209]  And I know the regular listeners understand that, but other people kind of just passively watch what pops up on their screen.
[01:32:46.569 --> 01:32:52.053]  They love the truth, they love liberty, but they're not thinking that there's an internet outside of Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.
[01:32:52.413 --> 01:32:54.974]  That's why you are how we outreach.
[01:32:55.114 --> 01:32:59.437]  You are how we get this information through the sensors to others.
[01:32:59.997 --> 01:33:01.258]  You are the resistance.
[01:33:01.518 --> 01:33:02.379]  So God bless you all.
[01:33:06.425 --> 01:33:10.968]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:26.799]  Big Brother Mainstream Media Government Cover-Ups
[01:33:28.251 --> 01:33:29.232]  You want answers?
[01:33:30.113 --> 01:33:31.174]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:32.095 --> 01:33:38.480]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.686 --> 01:33:42.928]  Well, we're getting him on the line right now via Skype.
[01:33:43.048 --> 01:33:46.550]  Larry C. Johnson, distinguished member of the CIA and counterterrorism.
[01:33:47.191 --> 01:33:50.853]  He's been pointing out that there's been a real attempted kill in this country for several years.
[01:33:50.913 --> 01:33:51.914]  It's all been confirmed.
[01:33:51.934 --> 01:33:59.259]  We'll get the latest from him in a moment, but here he was last week when I was on One American News as a guest.
[01:33:59.299 --> 01:34:04.703]  I noticed that he was live during one of their programs and thought what he said was very informative, so here it is.
[01:34:05.223 --> 01:34:11.640]  One of the strengths and weaknesses or dangers of this Five Eyes cooperative
[01:34:12.308 --> 01:34:17.872]  is that it provides a channel for sharing intelligence information.
[01:34:18.032 --> 01:34:31.942]  Johnson said there is a cooperation agreement between the intelligence services of the U.S., U.K., Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, the so-called Five Eyes Club, that allowed the Obama administration to access surveillance of U.S.
[01:34:31.982 --> 01:34:34.483]  citizens as foreign-gathered intelligence.
[01:34:34.684 --> 01:34:38.366]  On this side of the ocean, who are at the highest levels in the U.S.
[01:34:38.426 --> 01:34:39.427]  intelligence community,
[01:34:39.827 --> 01:34:46.831]  Just as the Trump administration took office, a senior official in the Obama Pentagon had an unguarded moment on MSNBC.
[01:35:01.897 --> 01:35:06.759]  I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people who left.
[01:35:06.819 --> 01:35:22.305]  So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy, that the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about their, the staff, the Trump staff dealing with Russians, that they would try to compromise those sources and methods.
[01:35:22.325 --> 01:35:27.627]  We know that specifically from a former Department of Defense official under Obama named Evelyn Farkas.
[01:35:28.127 --> 01:35:29.148]  She admitted to it!
[01:35:29.528 --> 01:35:35.773]  Johnson said in the beginning the British were simply curious about Donald Trump as he became a serious candidate for president.
[01:35:36.053 --> 01:35:50.544]  The British did this in part, I'm given to understand by people who were familiar with what was up, is that they were concerned about Trump's policies on NATO and Syria and they wanted to make sure that they could start understanding what he was up to.
[01:35:51.044 --> 01:35:57.169]  One clear example of the UK surveillance was the monitoring of Trump campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos, he said.
[01:35:57.509 --> 01:36:03.950]  How did George Papadopoulos come to the attention of both law enforcement and intelligence sources?
[01:36:03.970 --> 01:36:12.372]  And when you look at his story, you begin to realize his first communications from UK to the United States, they were emails.
[01:36:13.112 --> 01:36:16.092]  So maybe, and one or two phone calls, if I recall correctly.
[01:36:16.612 --> 01:36:18.193]  Well, those were intercepted.
[01:36:19.173 --> 01:36:24.694]  Absolutely, they were intercepted by the United Kingdom, through its General Communications Headquarters,
[01:36:25.157 --> 01:36:29.101]  All right, so that's Larry C. Johnson, and I've seen him on national television.
[01:36:29.121 --> 01:36:30.042]  He's been on the show before.
[01:36:30.062 --> 01:36:33.405]  I mean, he was laying all this out two-plus years ago, just like we were.
[01:36:33.905 --> 01:36:37.889]  What's crazy is how public all this is, how brazen all this is.
[01:36:38.249 --> 01:36:42.393]  And so I wanted to get into the five I's, the spying, how illegal this was.
[01:36:42.533 --> 01:36:43.934]  Trump says he's taken the gloves off.
[01:36:44.295 --> 01:36:45.356]  We've seen these firings.
[01:36:45.396 --> 01:36:47.037]  We've seen these high-level resignations.
[01:36:47.718 --> 01:36:49.479]  And I've talked to three people last week.
[01:36:50.342 --> 01:36:50.462]  to
[01:37:09.352 --> 01:37:10.733]  You know, run major operations.
[01:37:11.153 --> 01:37:12.553]  You're a respected guy and a patriot.
[01:37:13.033 --> 01:37:14.914]  What would you call this period we're in?
[01:37:15.614 --> 01:37:17.775]  I would call it a governmental civil war.
[01:37:17.835 --> 01:37:19.716]  I would call it a world crisis.
[01:37:20.316 --> 01:37:26.858]  What would you call this period we're in and now that the deep state or criminal elements of it have failed, where we're going here?
[01:37:27.999 --> 01:37:36.302]  Well, the intelligence community and the law enforcement community have been weaponized against the domestic opposition party.
[01:37:36.702 --> 01:37:37.442]  It's that simple.
[01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:50.526]  We've really never experienced in our history where these tools of government were turned on the opposing political party in such an intense way.
[01:37:51.066 --> 01:37:58.750]  And it was designed, you know, people will disparage Trump for calling it a coup, but I don't know what else you can call it.
[01:37:59.150 --> 01:38:01.711]  This is exactly a failed coup attempt.
[01:38:02.569 --> 01:38:11.532]  And people like Jim Clapper, John Brennan, Jim Comey and Loretta Lynch, Susan Rice, they were all involved, all implicated.
[01:38:12.333 --> 01:38:22.877]  And they're trying to pretend now that they were just, you know, looking for the bad deeds of Russians who just happened to stumble across all these Trump people, which is just a lie.
[01:38:26.696 --> 01:38:33.624]  You are the expert here, and the real expert is years ago I saw you on national TV, we had you on a few years ago, you were laying this out then.
[01:38:33.644 --> 01:38:35.546]  Now it's all been confirmed.
[01:38:36.848 --> 01:38:42.474]  Looking at the psychology of the different elements of the deep state, obviously they're just criminal cliques or in bed groups.
[01:38:43.035 --> 01:38:44.917]  Obama clearly left stay behind networks.
[01:38:46.198 --> 01:38:48.639]  In my research behind, they're still operating.
[01:38:49.179 --> 01:38:53.421]  And I think they thought from decades of getting away with whatever they wanted to that they were invincible.
[01:38:53.461 --> 01:39:01.243]  I don't think they understand they've overreached so far now that even the establishment realizes they've got to be punished and gotten rid of because they're not giving up.
[01:39:01.803 --> 01:39:04.604]  They are engaged in anti-free speech, terrorizing the public.
[01:39:05.044 --> 01:39:07.805]  If I got into the stuff they've done to me, I'm not trying to be in a victimology.
[01:39:07.845 --> 01:39:10.186]  It's actually entertaining, but it's like a spy movie.
[01:39:10.986 --> 01:39:12.267]  And so I'm wondering, what do you think
[01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:15.568]  Well, I hope Barr moves against him.
[01:39:15.648 --> 01:39:16.568]  I think he will.
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:38.344]  A lot of this, I do lay at the feet of Donald Trump himself, because when he came into office, he left all these people in place.
[01:39:38.384 --> 01:39:45.829]  He had the full authority and power to remove a lot of what are known as senior executive service, senior intelligence service.
[01:39:46.334 --> 01:39:46.735]  I agree.
[01:40:02.967 --> 01:40:05.809]  You yourself have experienced this persecution.
[01:40:06.210 --> 01:40:10.133]  We saw that James Rosen of Fox News was being spied upon.
[01:40:10.493 --> 01:40:12.535]  Other journalists were being spied upon.
[01:40:12.855 --> 01:40:24.084]  So this is something that the Obama administration started doing early on, and then it just, they got so used to doing it and getting away with it, it just escalated and expanded dramatically.
[01:40:24.144 --> 01:40:31.910]  And then when, you know, went through phases with Trump, because in the initial phase of the Trump campaign, nobody thought he was going to win.
[01:40:32.515 --> 01:40:51.060]  But they were collecting information that you would do for, let's call it, opposition research on steroids, because they were enlisting British firms, they were enlisting British intelligence, to help start identifying people that the Trump campaign folks were talking to.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:58.442]  And then, when it looked like Trump was going to get the nomination, it entered another phase, even more intense.
[01:40:58.942 --> 01:41:00.263]  And this starts about March of 2016.
[01:41:02.617 --> 01:41:11.819]  And you can see, that's when Perkins Coie hires Fusion GPS, and Christopher Steele is brought on to do the dossier.
[01:41:12.139 --> 01:41:16.400]  That's the time period they start going intensively after Papadopoulos.
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.641]  That's the time frame when they start going after Carter Page.
[01:41:19.961 --> 01:41:22.681]  So, this had sort of a natural progression.
[01:41:23.201 --> 01:41:26.462]  And then, phase three comes when Trump stuns them.
[01:41:26.482 --> 01:41:30.883]  Because I know for a fact, from a friend who was present in some conversations,
[01:41:31.682 --> 01:41:36.727]  Between Clapper and Brennan, that they genuinely did not believe that Trump would win.
[01:41:37.207 --> 01:41:40.730]  And they were even counseled by the FBI to don't be so certain of that.
[01:41:41.150 --> 01:41:44.794]  Oh, I know people that were in the room of security with Hillary, literally.
[01:41:45.254 --> 01:41:51.720]  She was totally drunk, got even drunker, threw a fit, attacked people and collapsed that night.
[01:41:52.721 --> 01:41:56.484]  Yeah, so this was, it was stunning for all of these folks.
[01:41:57.057 --> 01:42:12.891]  And it was at that point that it entered the phase three of trying to find an extra judicial way to get rid of Donald Trump, even entertaining thoughts of making approaches to federal judges to have his election ruled as illegal.
[01:42:13.451 --> 01:42:15.112]  And then, uh, opting for...
[01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:36.713]  The FBI and others, not to get into all the things that happen behind the scenes, but I reported this to the FBI, and I mean repeatedly this stuff.
[01:42:36.753 --> 01:42:37.313]  I caught them.
[01:42:37.913 --> 01:42:39.294]  And it's what you're saying.
[01:42:39.334 --> 01:42:40.955]  They're wild-eyed.
[01:42:41.995 --> 01:42:46.437]  They're not accustomed to having anybody stand up against them, so they've committed so many wild crimes.
[01:42:47.018 --> 01:42:48.378]  How does Trump not prosecute them?
[01:42:48.398 --> 01:42:51.179]  But as you said, why does Trump leave them in the government?
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:53.560]  We'll be right back with our guest Larry C. Johnson.
[01:42:53.821 --> 01:42:56.362]  We'll tell you about a website where you can read more of his writings as well when we come back.
[01:42:56.382 --> 01:42:56.762]  Stay with us.
[01:43:04.946 --> 01:43:14.348]  I want to put forward an allegory or a story to explain where I'm coming from that parallels current real-time reality.
[01:43:14.808 --> 01:43:24.571]  So please bear with me a few minutes because this is just bubbling up from my own thought processes of why am I sitting here with my shirt off.
[01:43:25.411 --> 01:43:27.432]  I want to be crystal clear with everybody.
[01:43:29.192 --> 01:43:33.053]  What I'm about to say is not about putting down California
[01:43:34.045 --> 01:43:40.271]  Like we're different football teams, and we're talking about the University of Texas versus UCLA.
[01:43:41.552 --> 01:43:45.876]  This is not Alex Jones as a tribalist going, woo!
[01:43:46.317 --> 01:43:48.098]  Texas is way better than California.
[01:43:48.318 --> 01:43:49.079]  F-California.
[01:43:50.521 --> 01:43:54.885]  California, until about 30 years ago, was undoubtedly the best state in the Union.
[01:43:56.104 --> 01:44:00.568]  It was more Texan than Texans because it was the last big frontier state.
[01:44:01.208 --> 01:44:02.769]  The 49ers, all of it.
[01:44:02.809 --> 01:44:06.012]  I mean, the history books I've read about it have been incredible.
[01:44:07.413 --> 01:44:11.656]  It was deep red until just about 25 years ago.
[01:44:13.478 --> 01:44:23.226]  The Democrats came in, they opened the borders, they engineered the state, they created socialism, dependency, and now the state is a skeleton of its former self.
[01:44:24.565 --> 01:44:36.012]  And now Beto and others have set their sights to turn Texas blue, and most political experts agree by 2024, Texas will be deep blue.
[01:44:36.952 --> 01:44:38.573]  My fellow Texans are in a coma.
[01:44:39.034 --> 01:44:46.198]  But as Kennedy said, and as Eisenhower said, and as Nixon said, and as Reagan said, as goes Texas, so goes the nation.
[01:44:46.418 --> 01:44:49.240]  It's been like that since the Civil War.
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:51.521]  That's a whole other history book.
[01:44:52.594 --> 01:45:00.837]  And so the fall of California, and it's a big, gaping hole in our defenses for the collapse of Latin America, it's not a positive thing.
[01:45:02.458 --> 01:45:03.859]  It's not something I celebrate.
[01:45:03.879 --> 01:45:05.399]  It's like whistling past the graveyard.
[01:45:05.459 --> 01:45:16.584]  But the carpetbaggers from all over the country that went to California, because it was the best state 30 years ago, who aren't Californians, they ruined that incredible state.
[01:45:17.384 --> 01:45:19.425]  They destroyed that incredible state.
[01:45:20.919 --> 01:45:29.684]  And now like locusts, or piranhas, or Nazi U-boat wolf packs, they have come to Texas to ruin our state.
[01:45:30.104 --> 01:45:47.555]  We have 10 different amazing t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com, like this Don't California, Buy USA flag t-shirt at InfoWarsTore.com that are great attention grabbers and conversation starters no matter where you live.
[01:45:48.658 --> 01:45:57.301]  In the country, because if the Democrats can take down Texas and Florida, it's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:58.584 --> 01:46:05.150]  The globalists want InfoWars to shut down because they can track back almost all their defeats are to what we do.
[01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:09.974]  I instinctively know how to defeat them, just like you do, before we resonate together.
[01:46:10.554 --> 01:46:16.600]  And I'm telling you, this Don't California My USA, this Don't California My Texas is the answer.
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:18.081]  But people have to be warned.
[01:46:18.641 --> 01:46:25.807]  We have 10 different limited edition shirts at InfoWarsTore.com right now for men and women in all the sizes.
[01:46:26.468 --> 01:46:28.309]  And I want this to be a major movement.
[01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:33.492]  And so, for the next week or so, while supplies last, 50% off.
[01:46:34.132 --> 01:46:37.935]  That means I'm making 5 bucks on these shirts that funds the InfoWars.
[01:46:38.135 --> 01:46:44.378]  So spread the word, meet like-minded people, cause a debate, become a billboard for liberty and freedom today.
[01:46:44.398 --> 01:46:50.322]  InfoWarsStore.com and look at the 10 limited edition
[01:46:51.414 --> 01:46:52.935]  Don't California my USA.
[01:46:52.955 --> 01:46:53.996]  Don't California Texas.
[01:46:54.536 --> 01:46:56.417]  I welcome folks to say don't California Florida.
[01:46:56.658 --> 01:46:59.139]  Let's just get this going nationwide and let's win again.
[01:46:59.459 --> 01:47:00.840]  We can do it if we take action.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:02.261]  We can save America.
[01:47:06.264 --> 01:47:08.906]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.039 --> 01:47:27.522]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[01:47:29.243 --> 01:47:34.365]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:36.206 --> 01:47:39.807]  Alright, he's riding a shotgun with us, Larry C. Johnson, 15 minutes to the next hour.
[01:47:39.867 --> 01:47:43.269]  Then our reporters, Caitlin Bennett and of course Millie Weaver.
[01:47:44.773 --> 01:47:45.974]  Have gone to the Biden rally.
[01:47:46.435 --> 01:47:48.917]  College leftists called cops on Infowars reporters.
[01:47:49.958 --> 01:47:50.819]  It's all coming up.
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:53.501]  The authoritarianism is incredible.
[01:47:54.622 --> 01:48:00.867]  I want listeners to understand something, and I know our audience gets this, but this is history happening.
[01:48:01.568 --> 01:48:04.671]  We're not up here dolling this up to sound alarmist or whatever.
[01:48:06.312 --> 01:48:07.613]  I have to pinch myself
[01:48:08.621 --> 01:48:18.552]  When I realize how serious this is, and like I said, a lot of times I just laugh at it, even when the stuff has gone on in my life, and I'm not really at liberty to get into a lot of it, but it's over the top, okay?
[01:48:18.913 --> 01:48:22.076]  It's stuff like you hear about in movies, but except you laugh at the people that are doing it.
[01:48:22.697 --> 01:48:28.683]  And I think that's kind of the good news is, all the scum they've sent after me act and look like mentally ill people.
[01:48:29.344 --> 01:48:34.727]  It doesn't matter that they work for intelligence agencies or big tax-free foundations.
[01:48:34.767 --> 01:48:36.188]  They've got their little secret agent card.
[01:48:36.469 --> 01:48:38.150]  They've never gone out and done anything real.
[01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:43.393]  So, as scary as they are, these are not the professionals.
[01:48:43.613 --> 01:48:45.114]  And I just have to tell you, I was in D.C.
[01:48:45.414 --> 01:48:48.276]  The police, the Secret Service last week, all listeners.
[01:48:48.416 --> 01:48:49.257]  I mean, all listeners.
[01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:52.259]  Um, and I'm not bragging.
[01:48:52.319 --> 01:48:58.363]  I'm saying that's good intel that the police and military are really awake about what's happening.
[01:48:58.843 --> 01:49:01.285]  They understand there's foreign interest manipulating the country.
[01:49:01.665 --> 01:49:06.328]  They understand that arrogant interests try to overthrow an election, try to stop an election.
[01:49:07.128 --> 01:49:12.952]  And the public, I think, understands that and sees there's a border crisis and really sees that this country is in 21st century war.
[01:49:13.373 --> 01:49:19.957]  But without me asking the questions and just getting back to our guest, Larry C. Johnson, who's one of the only other people other than like Colonel Schaefer, who we had on like
[01:49:19.957 --> 01:49:25.143]  Two years ago, three years ago, who laid out that there was an ongoing attempted coup and now it's been proven.
[01:49:26.454 --> 01:49:34.982]  Well, the mindset of the leftist and the stay-behind groups and what they're planning now, because now this has all come out.
[01:49:35.042 --> 01:49:39.186]  As you said, Trump's big failing is he didn't clean them out early, because I don't think he understood it.
[01:49:39.206 --> 01:49:40.027]  He wasn't from government.
[01:49:40.047 --> 01:49:40.687]  He got lied to.
[01:49:41.328 --> 01:49:43.230]  But what is... Here's a better question.
[01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:48.915]  What does the president need to do now, in your expert view, in your research view, talking to others?
[01:49:48.975 --> 01:49:50.016]  What's the best thinking on that?
[01:49:50.496 --> 01:49:51.497]  And then let's look at the...
[01:49:52.658 --> 01:49:53.059]  Enemy?
[01:49:53.359 --> 01:50:03.830]  The mentally ill scrap feeders of globalism that think they'll be able to be conquering something by trying to overthrow the country to turn it over to multinationals?
[01:50:03.870 --> 01:50:06.653]  I mean, quantify it in your own words without me putting words in your mouth.
[01:50:07.935 --> 01:50:09.717]  Just the epic moment we're in.
[01:50:11.172 --> 01:50:30.486]  The first thing he needs to do is declassify all of the relevant documents, even intelligence information, NSA documents, documents passed from liaison services like GCHQ, human intelligence documents, defiance awards, declassify it all, publish it, get it out there.
[01:50:30.926 --> 01:50:38.832]  Because it's going to be this kind of sunlight that's going to be required to disinfect this filth, really, which has dirtied up the American political system.
[01:50:39.372 --> 01:50:39.913]  That's number one.
[01:50:40.999 --> 01:50:47.321]  Number two, to go after and start rooting out these Obama holdovers that have been allowed to stay.
[01:50:47.361 --> 01:50:49.642]  I'll give you a case in point.
[01:50:49.662 --> 01:50:51.323]  A woman named Tina Kavanaugh.
[01:50:51.883 --> 01:50:57.565]  Tina used to be the ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism in the Bureau of Counterterrorism.
[01:50:58.265 --> 01:51:00.826]  And she was a diehard Hillary supporter.
[01:51:00.966 --> 01:51:01.906]  I mean, diehard.
[01:51:02.947 --> 01:51:09.049]  When Trump came into office, they allowed her to become the head of political military affairs at State.
[01:51:09.693 --> 01:51:21.882]  Now you can make the argument that that was just the internal state doing its own thing, but then it was compounded where she resigned from the Foreign Service and the Trump administration appointed her to a senior position at DOD.
[01:51:21.962 --> 01:51:23.023]  I mean, now this is crazy.
[01:51:24.084 --> 01:51:31.250]  You know, I know Trump likes to play the role of being a tough guy that hires and fires people, but... No, the truth is he doesn't know any of this.
[01:51:31.290 --> 01:51:36.554]  He has ideas, he wants to be president, he's just trusting his adjuncts and they are selling us out.
[01:51:37.423 --> 01:51:46.925]  Yeah, well, I don't know who's doing the sellout, but all I can tell you is people like Tina Cuddenout should not be around and allowed in the Trump administration.
[01:51:47.325 --> 01:51:49.846]  She is a pure partisan political hack.
[01:51:51.066 --> 01:51:59.288]  All right, I'm going to keep interrupting here, he's making so many great points, but Larry C. Johnson, former CIA counterterrorism expert who really predicted and laid all this out,
[01:52:00.464 --> 01:52:03.185]  Trump has now said he's going to release the classified info.
[01:52:03.945 --> 01:52:07.987]  But just like he said he'd get us out of Afghanistan, the Pentagon told him, no, don't do it, twisted his arm.
[01:52:10.227 --> 01:52:13.068]  I don't see how it gives up methods and all this stuff to release this.
[01:52:13.088 --> 01:52:14.129]  This was an internal coup.
[01:52:14.529 --> 01:52:15.769]  I think Trump has to do it.
[01:52:15.789 --> 01:52:19.891]  And he has to know now that if he doesn't root these groups out, they're not going to give up.
[01:52:20.211 --> 01:52:22.952]  So can we speak to that from what you studied in your sources?
[01:52:23.512 --> 01:52:24.752]  They don't seem to be giving up.
[01:52:24.792 --> 01:52:29.134]  They seem to be regrouping and trying something to, you know, to still overthrow this election.
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:33.042]  Yeah, no, this is like some bad zombie movie.
[01:52:33.323 --> 01:52:40.008]  They continue to come at us, and they just need to be stopped.
[01:52:41.749 --> 01:52:46.553]  This is the kind of thing that requires some tough, decisive action.
[01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:47.734]  And they're not giving up.
[01:52:47.854 --> 01:52:53.859]  But I think what we'll start seeing is if the first ones that get prosecuted or indicted
[01:52:54.620 --> 01:53:00.442]  Then they will start turning on each other because there is a self-preservation instinct will kick in.
[01:53:01.122 --> 01:53:08.185]  And I do have the confidence that Attorney General Barr is going to take this very seriously.
[01:53:08.205 --> 01:53:12.206]  I think the next shoe to drop comes with the Inspector General's report.
[01:53:12.828 --> 01:53:30.173]  Armed with an inspector's general's report that would show that Jim Comey leaked classified material and the likely possibility that at that point both McCabe and Comey themselves will be indicted, put in front of a grand jury and will likely be returned.
[01:53:33.211 --> 01:53:37.894]  For misuse of classified information and lying to the FBI.
[01:53:38.334 --> 01:53:46.479]  So, as that starts to happen, then I think you're going to see the panicked reaction among the conspirators grow even more intense.
[01:53:46.559 --> 01:53:56.825]  I mean, we saw Ben Rhodes this week, who was in the National Security Advisor role to President Obama, claiming that he sounded like
[01:53:58.766 --> 01:54:03.908]  The slave girl and gone with the wind, you know, he didn't know nothing about birth and no babies.
[01:54:04.208 --> 01:54:05.089]  He didn't know nothing.
[01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:07.429]  It was like Sergeant Schultz in Hogan's Heroes.
[01:54:07.609 --> 01:54:08.650]  I know nothing.
[01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.870]  I know.
[01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:16.373]  I mean, you even have like the top people in the State Department saying someone broken our computer and unmasked the spying.
[01:54:16.393 --> 01:54:22.915]  Yeah, this and the whole unmasking thing is a further indication of
[01:54:23.519 --> 01:54:32.728]  That this was an organized effort because to unmask means the names of people had to appear in intelligence reports.
[01:54:32.788 --> 01:54:35.290]  There are only two types of intelligence reports, Alex.
[01:54:36.011 --> 01:54:43.297]  One is a piece of signal intelligence from the NSA that's produced either by the NSA or from a liaison service like the British.
[01:54:44.118 --> 01:54:49.203]  Or you got a human intelligence report, which is generated principally by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:54:49.676 --> 01:54:52.719]  Those are the only two types of reports where someone's name is going to show up.
[01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:54.161]  And when it's a U.S.
[01:54:54.241 --> 01:55:00.688]  person's name, normally in those kinds of reports, they do not identify the individual by name.
[01:55:00.708 --> 01:55:03.952]  They'll say, Person 1, Person 2, Person 3, whatever.
[01:55:04.588 --> 01:55:11.510]  So, once the name is put into a report, it then allows government officials to come back and say, who is this?
[01:55:11.850 --> 01:55:13.091]  But there has to be a reason.
[01:55:13.111 --> 01:55:14.651]  Sure, and so they've been caught red-handed.
[01:55:14.731 --> 01:55:19.812]  I mean, I think Trump now realizes that they've committed so many crimes, he must go after them.
[01:55:19.832 --> 01:55:23.013]  And you've seen Hillary saying, arrest Trump, just last week.
[01:55:23.394 --> 01:55:24.394]  She's not stopping.
[01:55:25.254 --> 01:55:27.996]  And so, I mean, this is going to be a crisis.
[01:55:28.036 --> 01:55:30.477]  And I can't believe we're here calmly talking about this.
[01:55:30.497 --> 01:55:32.979]  This is, I think, a thousand times worse than Nixon.
[01:55:33.419 --> 01:55:37.501]  And I think it just shows their recklessness that they did all this.
[01:55:37.561 --> 01:55:40.803]  And it shows, I don't want to have this big shakeup.
[01:55:40.903 --> 01:55:42.144]  I don't want to have this confrontation.
[01:55:42.424 --> 01:55:51.930]  But it has to happen, because you just can't leave these Frankenstein rogue groups that have proven they're crazy just wandering around doing whatever they want.
[01:55:53.252 --> 01:56:03.979]  Well, it's not like they were really being smart about this or thinking it through like a professional chess player where they're anticipating moves four or five.
[01:56:26.155 --> 01:56:27.276]  Follow the money in this.
[01:56:27.296 --> 01:56:28.657]  That's one of the critical points.
[01:56:28.738 --> 01:56:40.008]  The money that was going to the Clinton Foundation coming out of the UK, out of key individuals in the United Kingdom, they're also wrapped up in this, in its very beginnings.
[01:56:40.089 --> 01:56:44.933]  There's a British security firm called Hauklut, H-A-K-L-U-Y-T.
[01:56:46.054 --> 01:56:49.016]  And those are mostly retired MI6 individuals.
[01:56:49.997 --> 01:56:58.002]  They were basically brought on board the Hillary Clinton campaign early on in 2015 to help do opposition research.
[01:56:58.523 --> 01:57:05.467]  And I think really sort of the root foundation of the British spying on the Trump campaign began there.
[01:57:05.887 --> 01:57:07.909]  And that's one of the things that needs to be looked into.
[01:57:16.155 --> 01:57:20.900]  You already said it's an attempt to overthrow the government of an election using governmental power.
[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:24.604]  This is probably one of the biggest scandals, if not the biggest, in our whole history.
[01:57:24.644 --> 01:57:25.365]  This is insane!
[01:57:26.531 --> 01:57:32.576]  Yeah, this violates laws and ethics on just enormous scale.
[01:57:32.596 --> 01:57:36.900]  Look, I was right in the middle of the whole Iran Contra mess as a CIA analyst.
[01:57:37.641 --> 01:57:46.508]  And I learned even back then, there's pressure to get involved with politics, but you have to keep your own personal politics out of it and just do your job.
[01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:49.691]  Let's come back and see where you as an expert think this is going.
[01:57:49.731 --> 01:57:50.452]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:57:57.227 --> 01:57:58.388]  You are the enemy of the people.
[01:57:58.408 --> 01:57:58.848]  Go ahead.
[01:57:59.128 --> 01:58:00.109]  Now get out of here!
[01:58:01.170 --> 01:58:01.971]  Get out of here!
[01:58:02.011 --> 01:58:02.591]  Get out of here!
[01:58:05.573 --> 01:58:07.715]  Go home to mommy!
[01:58:08.195 --> 01:58:08.576]  Bye!
[01:58:08.896 --> 01:58:09.777]  Go home to mommy!
[01:58:10.457 --> 01:58:11.418]  Go home to mommy!
[01:58:14.016 --> 01:58:14.717]  Let me ask you this.
[01:58:14.957 --> 01:58:19.621]  Have you heard from PETA, from your latest meme, for the abuse of animals now that you're engaged in?
[01:58:20.581 --> 01:58:25.445]  I haven't yet, but I see where you're going with it, and you know what?
[01:58:25.906 --> 01:58:32.451]  I realize now that doing what I did to that poor bird, it was not okay.
[01:58:32.551 --> 01:58:34.372]  Do you think that bird wants something to do with Trump?
[01:58:34.873 --> 01:58:35.533]  I don't think so.
[01:58:35.553 --> 01:58:40.937]  I mean, I didn't ask, and that was part of the problem, was I didn't get consent from the bird.
[01:58:41.798 --> 01:58:44.521]  Before I put the head on it, and I'm really sorry.
[01:58:45.081 --> 01:58:47.444]  Now, think about that dog that you've tortured now, too!
[01:58:48.204 --> 01:58:48.945]  Now that dog!
[01:58:49.065 --> 01:58:49.466]  The dog?
[01:58:49.526 --> 01:58:50.407]  No, the dog's fine.
[01:58:50.707 --> 01:58:53.890]  The dog is now CNN, so that means he's obviously good.
[01:58:54.170 --> 01:58:56.933]  Well, you've been torturing us, too, Carpe D'Antem.
[01:58:57.073 --> 01:58:57.734]  Don't you understand?
[01:58:58.734 --> 01:58:59.835]  We feel tortured by you.
[01:58:59.995 --> 01:59:05.237]  This dog now is going to have to live with this anguish and this pain that you've caused him.
[01:59:05.357 --> 01:59:08.319]  And quite frankly, I think PETA should file a complaint against you.
[01:59:08.499 --> 01:59:10.480]  Is there any limit to your bigotry?
[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:13.521]  There is literally no limit to my bigotry.
[01:59:14.482 --> 01:59:16.202]  It goes so deep.
[01:59:16.302 --> 01:59:17.223]  It has no bottom.
[01:59:17.243 --> 01:59:18.423]  It can't reach the bottom.
[01:59:18.704 --> 01:59:19.464]  It goes on forever.
[01:59:19.810 --> 01:59:20.050]  Wow.
[01:59:20.150 --> 01:59:21.471]  Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:22.071 --> 01:59:22.952]  Brian Stelter here.
[01:59:23.132 --> 01:59:27.175]  So you'll only get this type of quality content on reliable sources with CNN.
[01:59:27.235 --> 01:59:30.737]  I want to thank InfoWars for giving me this platform to do this groundbreaking interview.
[01:59:30.777 --> 01:59:33.599]  I think we now know the truth about the real Carpe D'Angel.
[01:59:33.799 --> 01:59:38.422]  And if I can, I will dox him to the public so that you can go harass him and his child.
[01:59:38.522 --> 01:59:40.263]  Because that's what we do at CNN.
[01:59:40.283 --> 01:59:43.445]  He got more viewers on InfoWars than he did on CNN.
[01:59:44.145 --> 01:59:44.586]  Wow!
[01:59:44.826 --> 01:59:46.228]  How about that for Brian Stelter?
[01:59:46.268 --> 01:59:47.709]  Hey, give Brian Stelter a round of applause.
[01:59:47.789 --> 01:59:51.113]  That's the biggest interview Brian Stelter has done in his career!
[01:59:54.697 --> 01:59:58.802]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.322 --> 02:00:00.604]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.124 --> 02:00:27.105]  Alright, this is a short segment.
[02:00:27.145 --> 02:00:28.867]  One more long segment with Larry C. Johnson.
[02:00:28.887 --> 02:00:30.448]  We've got to get back on more often.
[02:00:31.169 --> 02:00:35.654]  You know, the best way to find him is just Google Larry C. Johnson, Semper, Sec.
[02:00:35.674 --> 02:00:37.836]  Semper Tyrannis, and the Committee of Correspondents.
[02:00:37.856 --> 02:00:38.917]  You can read some of the articles there.
[02:00:39.297 --> 02:00:40.538]  We should post some of his great articles.
[02:00:40.558 --> 02:00:41.039]  They're excellent.
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:43.221]  But Larry C. Johnson joins us.
[02:00:43.742 --> 02:00:47.646]  And again, I like to go back to who, two years ago, two and a half years ago, was laying all this out.
[02:00:48.226 --> 02:00:49.667]  Obviously, he has a lot of sources.
[02:00:49.687 --> 02:00:52.267]  He didn't want to give away anything classified, but he was saying, I'd look at this.
[02:00:52.888 --> 02:00:53.588]  I'd look at that.
[02:00:53.728 --> 02:00:55.068]  Judge Napolitano said that.
[02:00:55.108 --> 02:00:55.648]  It got ignored.
[02:00:55.728 --> 02:00:56.249]  I said that.
[02:00:56.669 --> 02:00:57.769]  Colonel Schaffer said that.
[02:00:57.809 --> 02:00:59.790]  I had the former head of technical NSA on.
[02:01:00.230 --> 02:01:01.870]  William Binney, he'd just come right out and say it.
[02:01:03.431 --> 02:01:06.052]  And so now it's all here, and I just sit back.
[02:01:06.852 --> 02:01:16.879]  It's not like I want to fight with the Democrats of the deep state and the Republican bluebloods, but just the brazenness and the arrogance is really, I gotta say, frightening.
[02:01:16.919 --> 02:01:19.962]  It's like having a loose cannon inside your house that could run your kids over.
[02:01:20.622 --> 02:01:26.927]  Gut level, where do you think this is all going if Trump doesn't really pressure Barr?
[02:01:27.167 --> 02:01:29.249]  But I think Barr realizes how dangerous this is.
[02:01:29.589 --> 02:01:31.750]  This is truly rogue, insane groups.
[02:01:32.951 --> 02:01:34.693]  So I think Trump has just turned it over to Barr.
[02:01:34.713 --> 02:01:35.113]  What do you think?
[02:01:37.033 --> 02:01:40.994]  No, he was smart to select Bill Barr.
[02:01:42.514 --> 02:01:51.916]  When I was at State in the Counterterrorism Office, we worked closely with Barr then, who was Attorney General in 1990 and 91 period, on the Pan Am 103 bombing.
[02:01:51.976 --> 02:02:02.698]  And Bill Barr played a very critical role in helping get that investigation underway and the suspects for it actually prosecuted and arrested.
[02:02:03.678 --> 02:02:07.319]  He was also instrumental, I know, in doing some things with DEA at the time.
[02:02:07.859 --> 02:02:12.180]  One of my former business partners was dealing with Barr.
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:16.081]  So, you're saying he gets 35,000 foot and 10 feet?
[02:02:16.381 --> 02:02:17.161]  He gets the big picture?
[02:02:17.842 --> 02:02:23.603]  Yeah, no, he's smart, he understands how the government works, but he's also got a lot of integrity.
[02:02:24.102 --> 02:02:26.305]  He's not one who out to play political games.
[02:02:26.345 --> 02:02:31.411]  He understands that the law is there to be applied fairly and justly.
[02:02:31.832 --> 02:02:34.495]  And how big was it a few weeks ago when he said, no, there was spying?
[02:02:34.735 --> 02:02:35.816]  It's admitted there was spying.
[02:02:36.479 --> 02:02:41.041]  Yeah, you know, whatever you want to call it, counter, you know, surveillance.
[02:02:42.702 --> 02:02:51.587]  There could be legal spying, but the issue is, and he got right to the heart of it, was the spying on the Trump campaign done legally or illegally?
[02:02:51.987 --> 02:02:55.189]  And I think the evidence will show very clearly it was done illegally.
[02:02:55.389 --> 02:03:00.112]  Does that go to motive to change the election or does it go to how they did it with fake intelligence?
[02:03:01.678 --> 02:03:02.019]  Both.
[02:03:03.099 --> 02:03:21.311]  The fact that, you know, the disconnect of Christopher Steele's dossier being used as the justification for the FISA warrant, and it's being used as justification at the same time that the FBI is firing Christopher Steele as a clandestine informant.
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:34.503]  How in the world do you get rid of a clandestine informant because basically you're saying you no longer trust them, but then you go before a federal judge and swear that their information is valid and verified?
[02:03:34.883 --> 02:03:48.626]  I mean, that's just a disconnect that shows bad faith on the part of people like Comey, Sally Yates, Loretta Lynch, all members of the senior departments of the Department of Justice and the FBI.
[02:03:50.107 --> 02:03:59.614]  And the fact that they did not verify that, and yet continued to go back and reference it as justification for spying on Carter Page.
[02:04:00.315 --> 02:04:08.422]  Carter Page is a bit of a buffoon, but Carter Page did not do anything to jeopardize or hurt the security of the United States.
[02:04:08.782 --> 02:04:12.445]  And the thing people forget, they keep saying, oh, Russia interfered in our 2016 election.
[02:04:15.178 --> 02:04:16.139]  Are people morons?
[02:04:16.479 --> 02:04:20.723]  The United States and the Russians and the former Soviet Union... Everybody does it!
[02:04:20.743 --> 02:04:31.672]  ...have been spying on each other for 80 plus years, engaged in a whole variety of intelligence collection activities designed to influence public opinion.
[02:04:31.993 --> 02:04:38.018]  So grow up, stop acting like a bunch of babies and pretending that this thing was somehow new and different.
[02:04:38.458 --> 02:04:43.082]  It was not new, it was not different, but what it did highlight was a complete
[02:04:43.843 --> 02:04:46.527]  It was not the failure of the Obama administration.
[02:04:46.787 --> 02:04:50.252]  They made a deliberate decision to weaponize this fact.
[02:04:50.472 --> 02:04:51.814]  Larry C. Johnson, stay there.
[02:04:51.894 --> 02:04:54.718]  CIA, let's come back then and get into where you think it goes next.
[02:04:55.219 --> 02:04:56.381]  And your warning to the establishment.
[02:04:56.401 --> 02:04:57.662]  I'm going to get your warning to them.
[02:05:03.246 --> 02:05:09.588]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[02:05:09.909 --> 02:05:10.389]  Alpha Power.
[02:05:10.949 --> 02:05:14.130]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.

[02:05:55.523 --> 02:05:58.004]  Head to infowarstore.com today.
[02:06:15.808 --> 02:06:17.971]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:18.451 --> 02:06:19.833]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:30.089 --> 02:06:35.252]  Alright, final segment with Larry C. Johnson, decorated CIA leader.
[02:06:35.412 --> 02:06:45.438]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but he goes on a lot of national television, but most importantly, he laid out two years ago on this show and other shows what was really going on, the illegal spying, the attempted coup.
[02:06:46.840 --> 02:06:57.983]  But I know that the deep staters over the Carnegie Endowment, the Ford Endowment, the stay-behind networks, to use their words, the embeds, listen and watch this show.
[02:06:58.143 --> 02:07:00.324]  And they've wondered how we knew what they were doing, what they were up to.
[02:07:00.344 --> 02:07:01.444]  Well, I interviewed all the experts.
[02:07:01.944 --> 02:07:02.764]  I've studied history.
[02:07:02.944 --> 02:07:07.986]  Obama signed this countering disinformation and foreign propaganda act.
[02:07:08.406 --> 02:07:12.167]  They then called me a Russian agent in congressional hearings and the House Armed Services Committee.
[02:07:12.727 --> 02:07:15.328]  I then started enjoying the
[02:07:16.448 --> 02:07:19.571]  Counter espionage operations they were running against me because I'm a loyal American.
[02:07:20.492 --> 02:07:24.916]  And so I really got put in the deep end even though I'd historically studied this I got to experience it.
[02:07:25.676 --> 02:07:30.060]  And I couldn't believe how their agents and their operatives were like mental patients.
[02:07:30.701 --> 02:07:34.965]  They actually shook in fear around me and believed I was the devil.
[02:07:35.065 --> 02:07:37.507]  So we've got a big leg up on these people.
[02:07:37.567 --> 02:07:39.449]  They have mental patients folks.
[02:07:40.069 --> 02:07:54.439]  They don't have serious focus, people, and I'm not claiming I'm just a regular organic citizen, Mr. Tough Guy, but I mean, I know how to tie my shoelaces, I don't, you know, sit there and, you know, get the shakes when I gotta do something, and so I'm not saying, oh, we're superior, I'm actually scared.
[02:07:55.319 --> 02:08:04.425]  That the Democrats in the deep state, the ones that did this, are so unprofessional, so scared, so arrogant, so pathetic, because they're scared, but they're also super arrogant.
[02:08:04.685 --> 02:08:12.370]  So I know a big part of you in counterterrorism, and as one of their top guys, have to know what the establishment's doing, or your enemy, and understand their psychology.
[02:08:12.490 --> 02:08:13.511]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but
[02:08:14.071 --> 02:08:16.214]  I think I'm more scared because they're so incompetent.
[02:08:16.555 --> 02:08:17.396]  They've been caught.
[02:08:17.456 --> 02:08:20.159]  There's no way even Trump, if he wanted to cover this up, can.
[02:08:20.179 --> 02:08:22.242]  I think they've got to be prosecuted.
[02:08:22.282 --> 02:08:25.126]  But then, in that process, they've never sued for peace.
[02:08:25.567 --> 02:08:27.109]  They just keep attacking, attacking.
[02:08:27.149 --> 02:08:29.091]  So Trump's even more forced to.
[02:08:29.572 --> 02:08:31.294]  And then I'm afraid they're going to do things that
[02:08:32.222 --> 02:08:34.503]  Could sabotage U.S.
[02:08:34.543 --> 02:08:35.403]  military operations.
[02:08:35.423 --> 02:08:43.706]  I already talked to Pentagon folks that said early on that somebody was leaking where special operations was going to make Trump look bad in raids against ISIS.
[02:08:44.426 --> 02:08:48.007]  And so that's, I think, turned the military completely against Obama and Hillary.
[02:08:48.327 --> 02:08:49.308]  But that's what I'm saying, though.
[02:08:49.648 --> 02:08:57.230]  How many of these things, how many Air Force cadet commandants do you have to get caught staging false flag race war?
[02:08:57.591 --> 02:08:59.831]  How much do we have to put up with these crazy people?
[02:08:59.871 --> 02:09:01.172]  So correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:09:02.236 --> 02:09:05.599]  And then get into what is their mindset and what is your warning to them?
[02:09:05.619 --> 02:09:09.643]  Because you're really talking to the deep state rogue elements on the show, as you know.
[02:09:09.663 --> 02:09:12.665]  That's why you were openly earlier saying, get rid of this person, get rid of that person.
[02:09:13.066 --> 02:09:14.267]  They're watching, they're listening.
[02:09:14.307 --> 02:09:18.390]  So maybe like you're the FBI bullhorning into a group of bank robbers.
[02:09:18.671 --> 02:09:19.772]  Give up, you'll never get out.
[02:09:19.812 --> 02:09:22.274]  I mean, what do you say to these people to get them to stop?
[02:09:23.567 --> 02:09:32.438]  But it's important for your listeners to understand, Alex, that this relies entirely upon the veil of intelligence.
[02:09:33.139 --> 02:09:37.104]  So the intelligence that was initially collected by the British
[02:09:37.927 --> 02:09:41.390]  And then later collected by NSA and CIA.
[02:09:42.011 --> 02:09:43.272]  It was all contrived.
[02:09:43.793 --> 02:09:46.275]  It wasn't based out of actual actions.
[02:09:46.736 --> 02:09:55.004]  Instead it was done as sort of a, as a pretext or designed to paint Trump as having interactions with the Russians.
[02:09:55.064 --> 02:09:58.327]  Sure, to discredit the election and cover for their criminal activity.
[02:09:59.446 --> 02:10:04.269]  Yeah, and so within this, the FBI participated as well.
[02:10:04.729 --> 02:10:11.633]  When you look at the case of Felix Sater, for example, who played a critical role in the Trump Tower Moscow project.
[02:10:12.054 --> 02:10:16.516]  In fact, he was the one instigating and doing the negotiation, encouraged meetings with Putin.
[02:10:16.977 --> 02:10:19.578]  Once you realize he had been an FBI informant since 1998.
[02:10:21.259 --> 02:10:26.241]  And his status as an informant, he was signed up by none other than Andrew Weissman.
[02:10:26.702 --> 02:10:28.702]  Now, that's not just a mere coincidence.
[02:10:29.163 --> 02:10:39.147]  So what they counted on was they could justify their actions as a counterintelligence investigation because they had, quote, intelligence that was leading them to do this.
[02:10:39.567 --> 02:10:43.369]  But what they didn't admit to is that that intelligence was actually produced
[02:10:43.849 --> 02:11:01.297]  In response to requests from the Clinton campaign initially, and people affiliated with the Clinton campaign to come up and start doing opposition research on Donald Trump, but then to add the sort of the added flavor of having it appear as if it was legitimate intelligence.
[02:11:01.897 --> 02:11:10.741]  And you saw that in that clip that was played with Evelyn Farkas, the former DOD official, where she said, we got all this intelligence showing these contacts with Russia.
[02:11:11.363 --> 02:11:20.826]  And again, she was lying in that what they were not telling the people listening to her is that those contacts with Russians were staged.
[02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:25.167]  Staged by people, by groups like Military Intelligence, MI6.
[02:11:25.347 --> 02:11:26.768]  Explain that to people!
[02:11:26.828 --> 02:11:35.871]  These were double and triple agents, well known to everybody, who they would then call Russians, who were really Western intelligence or cutouts, making contact with people who never made deals.
[02:11:35.891 --> 02:11:39.432]  You know, I'm so proud that they even have to admit no American would take the money
[02:11:39.992 --> 02:11:40.874]  Including me.
[02:11:41.455 --> 02:11:43.098]  No American would take the money.
[02:11:43.158 --> 02:11:46.184]  They couldn't get anybody who was a nationalist to sell out.
[02:11:47.065 --> 02:11:47.306]  Right.
[02:11:47.787 --> 02:11:50.011]  And you know, take the case of George Papadopoulos.
[02:11:50.655 --> 02:11:53.496]  He was approached by a professor, Joseph Massoud.
[02:11:54.037 --> 02:12:00.440]  And Massoud is characterized, even in this very disingenuous Mueller report, as a Russian agent.
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:08.284]  When in fact, Massoud has long, extensive contacts with both the British MI6 and the U.S.
[02:12:08.344 --> 02:12:09.965]  Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:12:10.465 --> 02:12:12.706]  He was a Western intelligence asset.
[02:12:13.006 --> 02:12:14.687]  He was not working for the Russians.
[02:12:15.051 --> 02:12:26.553]  He was working for Western intelligence agencies, and yet he was the one that presented George Papadopoulos with, hey, opportunities to meet with Putin, and hey, opportunities to get involved with Russia.
[02:12:26.934 --> 02:12:31.174]  And that was a deliberate, provocative, or provocation.
[02:12:31.655 --> 02:12:38.216]  It's like baiting a hook and throwing it out there, hoping that the fish will bite so you can reel him in, and then blame the fish for getting caught.
[02:12:38.236 --> 02:12:41.917]  So it's total entrapment, and so none of it worked, and why do you think Mueller then had to back down?
[02:12:41.957 --> 02:12:42.897]  Because he came up so empty?
[02:12:44.232 --> 02:12:45.733]  Yeah, because there was no there there.
[02:12:45.833 --> 02:12:48.854]  I mean, this, you know, I was saying two years ago that this was a lie.
[02:12:49.334 --> 02:12:53.555]  And this was based on nothing, that this was an actual contrived effort.
[02:12:54.115 --> 02:12:57.296]  And everyone said, oh, it's crazy and conspiracy theorists.
[02:12:57.736 --> 02:12:59.097]  But there was no there there.
[02:12:59.717 --> 02:13:17.786]  And when people begin to understand that apart from Felix Sater, who is a 20-year FBI informant working in the Trump Tower since 2003, Henry Greenberg, another one that made approaches to Michael Caputo and to Roger Stone, was also an FBI informant.
[02:13:18.046 --> 02:13:23.369]  When you begin to realize that the FBI was actively using informants to try to entrap
[02:13:24.085 --> 02:13:24.726]  Trump people.
[02:13:24.906 --> 02:13:27.588]  And as you said, everybody knows that who's informed.
[02:13:27.889 --> 02:13:32.994]  You read the report, they act like these that are known informants are FSB agents.
[02:13:33.434 --> 02:13:33.974]  It's insane.
[02:13:33.994 --> 02:13:35.756]  So I know you don't like the grandstand, but I'm serious.
[02:13:36.116 --> 02:13:41.802]  In the time we have, sir, Larry C. Johnson, former CIA counterterrorism, what would you say to the deep state?
[02:13:41.822 --> 02:13:43.343]  Or what do you think they're thinking right now?
[02:13:43.624 --> 02:13:45.405]  They've got to know the walls are closing in.
[02:13:45.425 --> 02:13:46.426]  They kept saying that about Trump.
[02:13:46.707 --> 02:13:47.848]  Know they're closing in on them.
[02:13:49.541 --> 02:13:55.583]  I don't think they fully realize or appreciate that the walls are going to completely close in on them.
[02:13:55.983 --> 02:14:02.245]  I think they're counting on the fact that they've still got some buddies and some friends on the inside that will help deflect and defuse this.
[02:14:02.785 --> 02:14:12.608]  But it's incumbent upon Trump, as I noted earlier, release the documents, declassify this information, expose to the American public.
[02:14:12.628 --> 02:14:15.189]  Start the prosecution and they'll fall like dominoes.
[02:14:16.215 --> 02:14:17.056]  Yeah, these are traitors.
[02:14:17.256 --> 02:14:19.338]  These are genuine traitors.
[02:14:19.498 --> 02:14:23.221]  People like Jim Clapper, John Brennan, they are absolute traitors.
[02:14:23.261 --> 02:14:35.170]  They were engaged with sedition and they tried to disrupt a legitimately elected president simply because they didn't like his politics or his policies, but he was voted for by the American people, not by him.
[02:14:35.230 --> 02:14:38.912]  You know, you're a, when I say conservative, what you say is conservative.
[02:14:38.932 --> 02:14:44.615]  I've been watching you on the air for six, seven, eight years, and you did accurately lay all this out, but I know you got to go.
[02:14:45.395 --> 02:14:48.557]  But you just saying they're traitors, this is absolute traitors, we've got to do something.
[02:14:48.577 --> 02:14:49.617]  You're totally right.
[02:14:50.478 --> 02:14:52.499]  And I just can't believe we've gotten in this position.
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:57.801]  Yeah, this is the stuff that civil wars are made of.
[02:14:58.301 --> 02:15:03.224]  And what has made America, you know, America's had its flaws.
[02:15:03.749 --> 02:15:05.591]  And there have been mistakes over the years.
[02:15:05.651 --> 02:15:07.974]  You know, we saw it with the Hollywood blacklist period.
[02:15:08.454 --> 02:15:19.125]  And I never thought we would see the Democratic left engage in the same tactics that they accused the Republicans of doing in the 1940s and early 50s.
[02:15:19.506 --> 02:15:25.192]  But here we are with the Democrats being more McCarthy-ite than anything that Joseph McCarthy did back in the day.
[02:15:25.532 --> 02:15:28.615]  All right, well listen, Larry C. Johnson, I want to invite you to fly to Austin.
[02:15:28.635 --> 02:15:29.095]  I'll fly you here.
[02:15:29.115 --> 02:15:30.156]  I'd love to have you in the studio.
[02:15:30.596 --> 02:15:31.457]  I know you've got to go.
[02:15:31.497 --> 02:15:32.278]  You've been very gracious.
[02:15:32.318 --> 02:15:36.101]  But since you bring up civil war, that's what other former CIA and FBI are saying.
[02:15:36.121 --> 02:15:37.402]  They've now gotten into antifa groups.
[02:15:37.722 --> 02:15:39.824]  They're actually planning this as they're overthrowing Trump.
[02:15:40.124 --> 02:15:45.709]  Do three more minutes with us on the other side, then I'll let you go, about you keep bringing up civil war, you keep bringing up this climate.
[02:15:46.189 --> 02:15:49.250]  That's how I think they're going to strike back, and I think that's how they're saying they're going to strike back.
[02:15:49.490 --> 02:15:55.391]  So just briefly on the other side, put bookends on this about the clear and present danger, because I don't think they're going to give up, and I think you're saying the same thing.
[02:15:55.771 --> 02:15:57.592]  That's where I was going next, even though you were going to leave us.
[02:15:57.832 --> 02:15:59.112]  So please tell us your view on that, sir.
[02:15:59.152 --> 02:15:59.732]  Thank you so much.
[02:15:59.952 --> 02:16:00.792]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:16:00.812 --> 02:16:02.733]  Stay with us.
[02:16:04.733 --> 02:16:14.136]  I want to put forward an allegory or a story to explain where I'm coming from that parallels current real-time reality.
[02:16:14.596 --> 02:16:15.056]  So please,
[02:16:16.089 --> 02:16:24.354]  Bear with me a few minutes because this is just bubbling up from my own thought processes of why am I sitting here with my shirt off.
[02:16:25.195 --> 02:16:27.236]  I want to be crystal clear with everybody.
[02:16:28.977 --> 02:16:40.064]  What I'm about to say is not about putting down California like we're different football teams and we're talking about the University of Texas versus UCLA.
[02:16:41.345 --> 02:16:41.866]  This is not
[02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:45.681]  Alex Jones is a tribalist going, woo!
[02:16:46.081 --> 02:16:47.861]  Texas is way better than California.
[02:16:48.101 --> 02:16:48.841]  F-California.
[02:16:50.282 --> 02:16:54.703]  California, until about 30 years ago, was undoubtedly the best state in the Union.
[02:16:55.883 --> 02:17:00.364]  It was more Texan than Texans because it was the last big frontier state.
[02:17:00.984 --> 02:17:02.545]  The 49ers, all of it.
[02:17:02.605 --> 02:17:05.786]  I mean, the history books I've read about it have been incredible.
[02:17:07.186 --> 02:17:11.387]  It was deep red until just about 25 years ago.
[02:17:13.370 --> 02:17:23.093]  Democrats came in, they opened the borders, they engineered the state, they created socialism, dependency, and now the state is a skeleton of its former self.
[02:17:24.354 --> 02:17:30.896]  And now Beto and others have set their sights to turn Texas blue, and most political experts agree, by 2020,
[02:17:33.069 --> 02:17:35.791]  24.
[02:17:33.430 --> 02:17:35.791]  Texas will be deep blue.
[02:17:36.731 --> 02:17:38.332]  My fellow Texans are in a coma.
[02:17:38.813 --> 02:17:45.977]  But as Kennedy said, and as Eisenhower said, and as Nixon said, and as Reagan said, as goes Texas, so goes the nation.
[02:17:46.197 --> 02:17:49.018]  It's been like that since the Civil War.
[02:17:50.439 --> 02:17:51.340]  That's a whole other history book.
[02:17:52.380 --> 02:18:00.605]  And so the fall of California, and it's a big gaping hole in our defenses for the collapse of Latin America, is not a positive thing.
[02:18:02.278 --> 02:18:16.374]  It's not something I celebrate, it's like whistling past the graveyard, but the carpetbaggers from all over the country that went to California because it was the best state 30 years ago, who aren't Californians, they ruined that incredible state.
[02:18:17.175 --> 02:18:19.217]  They destroyed that incredible state.
[02:18:20.711 --> 02:18:29.457]  And now like locusts, or piranhas, or Nazi U-Boat wolf packs, they have come to Texas to ruin our state.
[02:18:29.897 --> 02:18:47.350]  We have 10 different amazing t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com, like this Don't California, Buy USA flag t-shirt at InfoWarsTore.com that are great attention grabbers and conversation starters no matter where you live.
[02:18:48.453 --> 02:18:57.100]  In the country, because if the Democrats can take down Texas and Florida, it's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:18:58.381 --> 02:19:02.924]  The globalists want info wars shut down because they can track back.
[02:19:03.004 --> 02:19:04.946]  Almost all their defeats are to what we do.
[02:19:05.626 --> 02:19:08.508]  I instinctively know how to defeat them, just like you do.
[02:19:08.789 --> 02:19:09.729]  Probably resonate together.
[02:19:10.370 --> 02:19:13.392]  And I'm telling you, this don't California, my USA.
[02:19:13.732 --> 02:19:16.395]  This don't California, my Texas, is the answer.
[02:19:16.655 --> 02:19:17.856]  The people have to be warned.
[02:19:18.416 --> 02:19:25.601]  We have 10 different limited edition shirts at InfoWarsStore.com right now for men and women in all the sizes.
[02:19:26.241 --> 02:19:28.103]  And I want this to be a major movement.
[02:19:29.063 --> 02:19:33.006]  And so for the next week or so, all supplies last 50% off.
[02:19:33.026 --> 02:19:37.909]  That means I'm making five bucks on these shirts that funds the InfoWars.
[02:19:37.949 --> 02:19:44.173]  So spread the word, meet like-minded people, cause a debate, become a billboard for liberty and freedom today.
[02:19:44.193 --> 02:19:47.515]  InfoWarsStore.com and look at the 10.
[02:19:48.536 --> 02:19:50.156]  Limited edition.
[02:19:51.197 --> 02:19:52.697]  Don't California my USA.
[02:19:52.717 --> 02:19:53.657]  Don't California Texas.
[02:19:53.697 --> 02:19:56.198]  And I welcome folks to say don't California Florida.
[02:19:56.438 --> 02:19:58.919]  Let's just get this going nationwide and let's win again.
[02:19:59.239 --> 02:20:00.639]  We can do it if we take action.
[02:20:00.819 --> 02:20:02.039]  We can save America.
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:08.881]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:25.011 --> 02:20:27.456]  All right, final segment with our guests.
[02:20:27.476 --> 02:20:30.844]  Then we're getting Millie Weaver on about the Joe Biden rally last night and more.
[02:20:32.279 --> 02:20:42.042]  Larry C. Johnson is a highly decorated, respected, former CIA operative, commander, counterterrorism specialist.
[02:20:42.062 --> 02:20:52.306]  I'm not going to go over his whole awards and decorated past, but he's one of the most cogent, focused, accurate people in the last two plus years that I was watching, saying what was really going on, what was going to come out.
[02:20:53.146 --> 02:20:58.468]  And again, I'm not one of these people that dreams of civil war and going out and getting the lefties.
[02:20:58.548 --> 02:20:59.749]  I mean, I'm not even a right winger.
[02:20:59.769 --> 02:21:00.529]  I'm just a populist.
[02:21:02.694 --> 02:21:08.036]  When I go out in public, sometimes in Austin, and most people shake my hand, but others say, we're going to kill you, we're going to get you.
[02:21:08.276 --> 02:21:10.097]  They attack me, they think they're allowed to do that.
[02:21:11.317 --> 02:21:12.698]  They're at a crazed level.
[02:21:12.878 --> 02:21:14.318]  And then I get all these FBI reports.
[02:21:14.378 --> 02:21:15.659]  I don't just believe FBI reports.
[02:21:15.699 --> 02:21:16.559]  Some are true, some aren't.
[02:21:16.899 --> 02:21:26.983]  I've, well, I'll just say it, we've infiltrated Antifa groups, everybody knows that, where they're like, we're going to put people in camps, and we're going to have a race war, and we're going to link up with MS-13.
[02:21:27.043 --> 02:21:29.024]  I said that over a year ago, the media freaked out.
[02:21:29.784 --> 02:21:41.433]  And then now you've got other CIA former analysts like Kevin Schipp basically saying everything that our guest Larry C. Johnson is saying, that they're planning a violent overthrow, they want it, they're buying full-page ads, saying it.
[02:21:41.473 --> 02:21:47.297]  I don't think Antifa is going to lead this overthrow of Trump, but I think they could be the trigger for real civil unrest.
[02:21:47.377 --> 02:21:50.839]  And I just think if we know this is coming, we have a duty to stop it.
[02:21:50.859 --> 02:21:51.780]  This isn't free speech.
[02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:54.662]  So you talk about the climate being perfect for a civil war.
[02:21:55.082 --> 02:21:56.984]  Can you speak to that and how you think we can stop it?
[02:21:58.482 --> 02:22:03.745]  Well, this division that's being propagated by the media.
[02:22:04.405 --> 02:22:10.348]  I've never, you know, I've been involved with doing media talking head stuff since it started like, well, 1995, 94.
[02:22:11.408 --> 02:22:13.769]  You've been on everything.
[02:22:13.809 --> 02:22:14.610]  Carlos the Jackal.
[02:22:14.650 --> 02:22:18.051]  And I was on ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC.
[02:22:18.071 --> 02:22:20.352]  I've seen you on Nightline, I think, like 20 years ago.
[02:22:20.372 --> 02:22:21.273]  So yeah, you've been everywhere.
[02:22:22.170 --> 02:22:23.952]  I did Nightline probably eight or nine times.
[02:22:23.972 --> 02:22:31.939]  So going back almost 30 years, I have never seen such a dishonest display.
[02:22:32.619 --> 02:22:40.566]  I mean, deliberate dishonesty on the part of media types, particularly at MSNBC and at CNN.
[02:22:40.606 --> 02:22:42.348]  But it's really going throughout the media.
[02:22:42.768 --> 02:22:45.911]  No one's actually trying to be honest about covering the stories.
[02:22:45.951 --> 02:22:47.893]  Now, the saving grace is this.
[02:22:48.593 --> 02:23:05.023]  Talk radio, like your show and like Rush Limbaugh's show, if you compare Rush Limbaugh's show to all the major media, as many people listen to Rush Limbaugh as watch ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News on any given night.
[02:23:05.163 --> 02:23:05.883]  Think about that.
[02:23:06.403 --> 02:23:13.387]  The total numbers that are just listening to Rush, as an example, are comparable to what's going on the television.
[02:23:13.467 --> 02:23:15.909]  And by the way, before they censored us, we were at that same level.
[02:23:16.707 --> 02:23:16.907]  Yeah.
[02:23:17.187 --> 02:23:18.188]  So, that's what I say.
[02:23:18.508 --> 02:23:23.070]  Your show and other shows, it gets out there and it counters the argument.
[02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:24.170]  They can't control it.
[02:23:24.190 --> 02:23:25.431]  They want to try to control it.
[02:23:25.771 --> 02:23:32.534]  The way they try to control it is by destroying you, by destroying your reputation, and by trying to characterize you as a complete crank.
[02:23:32.934 --> 02:23:34.555]  So, I mean, that's how they do it.
[02:23:34.595 --> 02:23:36.956]  I've been called a complete conspiracy theorist.
[02:23:37.076 --> 02:23:37.656]  No, I saw it.
[02:23:37.676 --> 02:23:38.777]  You've been totally vindicated.
[02:23:38.817 --> 02:23:41.518]  So, what does the corporate media do as they lose all credibility now?
[02:23:41.558 --> 02:23:43.659]  They're losing the little bit of ratings they had are gone.
[02:23:44.574 --> 02:23:45.595]  Well, and then they ignore you.
[02:23:46.095 --> 02:23:47.976]  So they ignore this story.
[02:23:48.676 --> 02:23:54.179]  And it's just, but what's important in all of this is that we continue to hammer on the truth.
[02:23:54.640 --> 02:23:55.600]  Get the truth out there.
[02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:56.461]  Get the facts out there.
[02:23:56.481 --> 02:23:57.541]  Get the documents out there.
[02:23:57.561 --> 02:24:03.805]  Because at the core in America, there are people who are willing to be persuaded by facts, but they need to be educated.
[02:24:04.225 --> 02:24:05.166]  And they need to be taught.
[02:24:05.686 --> 02:24:06.706]  And I don't think... I totally agree.
[02:24:06.726 --> 02:24:07.787]  Let me say this in closing.
[02:24:08.027 --> 02:24:08.787]  Here's my concern.
[02:24:09.427 --> 02:24:13.189]  I think if criminal elements, because people say, well, you've got the CIA on, but you say the CIA's bad.
[02:24:13.229 --> 02:24:14.450]  No, it's like anything.
[02:24:14.470 --> 02:24:15.550]  There's good people, bad people.
[02:24:15.570 --> 02:24:16.511]  Do you follow the Constitution?
[02:24:16.531 --> 02:24:16.931]  Do you not?
[02:24:18.691 --> 02:24:19.632]  It's which sides you're on.
[02:24:19.672 --> 02:24:23.374]  I think you're on the Americana side, just on the free market side, on the Constitution side.
[02:24:23.394 --> 02:24:24.094]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:24:24.914 --> 02:24:25.114]  Yes.
[02:24:25.174 --> 02:24:26.375]  But people don't seem to understand.
[02:24:27.714 --> 02:24:27.894]  He's
[02:24:44.263 --> 02:24:48.025]  I mean, I say to the establishment, the corrupt elements of it, this way leads doom.
[02:24:48.445 --> 02:24:59.550]  I mean, what do you see in your crystal ball in closing, if they're able to trigger the race war, the civil war that are in WikiLeaks, that the Democrats are dreaming of, that Netflix is pushing, that they think is going to turn all this around?
[02:24:59.850 --> 02:25:01.951]  I don't think they can put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[02:25:01.991 --> 02:25:06.893]  I think they can only summon the whirlwind that will destroy them, and I don't want to be in the middle of that.
[02:25:08.248 --> 02:25:15.512]  Yeah, well, unfortunately, I think if history teaches us anything, it's going to require some sort of external crisis to bring us back together.
[02:25:16.092 --> 02:25:24.556]  And at this point, we're still on a collision course where the divisions that are being encouraged and promoted by many in the media and many with Hollywood.
[02:25:25.734 --> 02:25:29.815]  That they're creating a mem of a deep, dark division in America.
[02:25:29.835 --> 02:25:32.316]  And yet, at the core of America, there's a good heart.
[02:25:32.496 --> 02:25:32.816]  There is.
[02:25:32.876 --> 02:25:34.817]  And there are people who are willing to come together.
[02:25:34.837 --> 02:25:40.358]  And I still believe and trust that that element can be touched and coalesced.
[02:25:40.838 --> 02:25:45.780]  And plus, the reality is most of them have guns and the folks advocating this other don't.
[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:47.360]  Well, here's my final question.
[02:25:47.380 --> 02:25:49.141]  I really appreciate your time and I hope you're out of books.
[02:25:49.181 --> 02:25:50.062]  We can plug it.
[02:25:50.082 --> 02:25:52.623]  You're really a selfless patriot out there, I guess, for everybody's own interest.
[02:25:53.323 --> 02:26:01.146]  But you saw Brennan and Clapper, I'm sure, three weeks ago do the tour saying, OK, we did watch Trump because, you know, he's a Russian or whatever.
[02:26:01.166 --> 02:26:02.087]  Still putting that lie on.
[02:26:02.427 --> 02:26:07.569]  We were ordered by Obama declaring executive privilege, executive authorization.
[02:26:08.029 --> 02:26:11.491]  I think that shows that they know they're caught and they're desperate now.
[02:26:11.511 --> 02:26:12.291]  I think that's a big deal.
[02:26:13.257 --> 02:26:14.397]  Yeah, it was a very big deal.
[02:26:14.937 --> 02:26:19.299]  Clapper was sort of the brains in chief on the intel side behind this, not Brennan.
[02:26:19.339 --> 02:26:24.540]  But Brennan was a willing participant and was an enthusiastic participant.
[02:26:25.020 --> 02:26:27.161]  Brennan's failing is just not very bright.
[02:26:27.181 --> 02:26:32.962]  He's sort of a dummy and always has been just a mediocre intellect, but likes to think that he's really smart.
[02:26:33.742 --> 02:26:35.763]  But Clapper was over all 17 agencies.
[02:26:35.803 --> 02:26:36.683]  He was really able to
[02:26:37.887 --> 02:26:46.374]  Yeah, Clapper is a much more devious character, and was, excuse me, instrumental in helping this guy.
[02:26:46.394 --> 02:26:49.276]  Who does he work for, from your sources, or what makes him tick?
[02:26:50.037 --> 02:26:52.739]  I mean, we know that Brennan's a communist and just is an idiot.
[02:26:53.399 --> 02:26:54.400]  What makes Clapper tick?
[02:26:55.521 --> 02:27:06.230]  Clapper is just very much a self-server, and serving his own interests, and he figured that there was some political benefit to be derived by hitching his wagon to the Hillary Clinton train.
[02:27:08.026 --> 02:27:09.487]  But that's failed him.
[02:27:09.587 --> 02:27:11.228]  How could they get themselves out of this?
[02:27:11.248 --> 02:27:12.148]  I keep saying last question.
[02:27:12.268 --> 02:27:14.129]  You're a smart guy, though.
[02:27:14.589 --> 02:27:15.870]  Couldn't they sue for peace with Trump?
[02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:17.030]  But I guess they can't be trusted.
[02:27:17.890 --> 02:27:18.351]  No, they won't.
[02:27:18.611 --> 02:27:19.951]  Suing for peace won't be an option.
[02:27:19.991 --> 02:27:24.793]  What they're going to try to do is claim that if Trump goes forward with this, he's going to damage U.S.
[02:27:24.853 --> 02:27:25.874]  intelligence and U.S.
[02:27:25.914 --> 02:27:28.755]  security by exposing intelligence sources and methods.
[02:27:28.975 --> 02:27:31.696]  They're going to try to hide behind that and play that card.
[02:27:32.972 --> 02:27:35.213]  So, bottom line, we're in for some major fireworks.
[02:27:35.313 --> 02:27:37.134]  I would call this the most critical time in U.S.
[02:27:37.174 --> 02:27:38.814]  history since its founding.
[02:27:38.834 --> 02:27:39.754]  You think that's an accurate statement?
[02:27:40.535 --> 02:27:41.415]  Yeah, no, I think so.
[02:27:41.435 --> 02:27:52.039]  The next three months are going to be extremely crucial, because the report from Inspector General Horowitz is coming out, and then Trump is supposed to start classifying all of this information.
[02:27:52.539 --> 02:27:54.040]  And when it comes, it's going to be a flood.
[02:27:54.540 --> 02:27:58.881]  All right, Larry C. Johnson, I wish you, I mean, I know you linked some sites to have your work.
[02:27:58.921 --> 02:27:59.702]  How do people find you?
[02:27:59.722 --> 02:28:00.382]  You're a smart guy.
[02:28:01.801 --> 02:28:06.022]  Yeah, I blog at Pat Lang's blog, Six Semper Tyrannus, as you pointed out.
[02:28:06.742 --> 02:28:10.803]  Pat used to be the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency's Middle East Division.
[02:28:11.323 --> 02:28:13.363]  He set up the Arabic program at West Point.
[02:28:13.843 --> 02:28:18.324]  He is really one of the leading scholars in the United States on U.S.-Arab relations.
[02:28:19.004 --> 02:28:21.905]  And so I'm just proud to be able to write at his blog.
[02:28:21.945 --> 02:28:25.545]  So Six Semper Tyrannus, Six Semper Tyrannus, that's Latin, folks.
[02:28:25.945 --> 02:28:27.886]  Larry C. Johnson, thank you for all the time, sir.
[02:28:27.926 --> 02:28:28.366]  God bless you.
[02:28:29.301 --> 02:28:30.161]  Okay, thank you, Alex.
[02:28:30.261 --> 02:28:30.561]  Bye-bye.
[02:28:30.802 --> 02:28:31.102]  Thank you.
[02:28:31.402 --> 02:28:34.263]  There's no doubt, folks, we're all in this together now.
[02:28:34.323 --> 02:28:39.845]  This is crazy town, crazy town, crazy town.
[02:28:41.265 --> 02:28:44.386]  They all went on the news and said two and a half years ago they spied on Trump.
[02:28:44.406 --> 02:28:45.267]  They had the proof he was a Russian.
[02:28:45.447 --> 02:28:46.267]  Then they said they didn't do it.
[02:28:46.667 --> 02:28:47.668]  They've been spying on me.
[02:28:47.888 --> 02:28:48.668]  Came out in the news.
[02:28:49.868 --> 02:28:50.789]  And again, I go back to it.
[02:28:51.329 --> 02:28:53.990]  When you get around their operatives, they're like mental patients.
[02:28:54.010 --> 02:28:56.511]  They're like SJWs with guns.
[02:28:58.868 --> 02:28:59.533]  Hold her up.
[02:28:59.553 --> 02:29:00.017]  Stay with us.
[02:29:02.890 --> 02:29:06.112]  The globalists are hammering humanity with bad halogens.
[02:29:06.553 --> 02:29:07.873]  Fluoride being chief amongst them.
[02:29:08.354 --> 02:29:13.277]  While they try to keep the one good halogen out of the food supply, and that's iodine.
[02:29:13.497 --> 02:29:16.098]  But most iodine isn't pure, so you can't absorb it.
[02:29:16.299 --> 02:29:16.799]  Well, guess what?
[02:29:16.919 --> 02:29:19.040]  X2's back in stock, and it's discounted.
[02:29:19.060 --> 02:29:23.843]  And when you get a bottle of the original X2, you get a free bottle of X3 to see how amazing it is.
[02:29:24.343 --> 02:29:26.485]  Only at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:29:26.905 --> 02:29:27.866]  Now, stay with us.
[02:29:27.986 --> 02:29:29.807]  I'll break down the latest developments.
[02:29:42.672 --> 02:29:43.873]  There is a war.
[02:29:43.893 --> 02:29:45.814]  It's happening now.
[02:29:46.034 --> 02:29:48.095]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:29:48.616 --> 02:29:50.877]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:29:51.197 --> 02:29:52.698]  We are the resistance.
[02:29:53.118 --> 02:29:54.699]  We are the Infowar.
[02:30:01.544 --> 02:30:05.754]  There are a lot of people out there that say they're on the front lines of the fight for liberty.
[02:30:06.536 --> 02:30:06.997]  And some are.
[02:30:08.567 --> 02:30:10.228]  But I'm not doing this to be famous.
[02:30:10.288 --> 02:30:11.930]  I'm doing this because it was the right thing to do.
[02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:14.472]  And let me tell you, I've gotten deep into this fight.
[02:30:15.232 --> 02:30:18.675]  And I've got the globalists pulling out every stop and every dirty trick you can imagine.
[02:30:19.395 --> 02:30:31.525]  But because you've stood with Infowars, because you've spread the word, and because you've bought the products we sell that fund our operations, we are here in the face of the globalist tyranny being more aggressive and more effective than ever.
[02:30:32.265 --> 02:30:33.306]  I just went to D.C.
[02:30:33.366 --> 02:30:38.411]  and bullhorned the president while Jack Dorsey was inside, lying, saying they don't censor conservatives.
[02:30:39.011 --> 02:30:42.394]  Ilhan Omar is calling for Trump to be banned, for God's sakes.
[02:30:43.095 --> 02:30:43.996]  And we were in D.C.
[02:30:44.016 --> 02:30:52.023]  doing dozens of major interviews and really affecting change and getting the president to go after the deep state with criminal charges, which you heard about years ago.
[02:30:52.244 --> 02:30:54.345]  And now the president's finally getting ready to do it.
[02:30:55.046 --> 02:30:56.527]  We are the real change agents.
[02:30:56.627 --> 02:30:58.809]  We are effective because we tell the truth.
[02:30:59.470 --> 02:31:02.632]  But without you backing us, we won't be here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:03.153 --> 02:31:06.656]  Without you supporting us, the globalists will be able to shut us down.
[02:31:08.058 --> 02:31:13.223]  Please understand that my philosophy is to give you the very best information out there.
[02:31:13.923 --> 02:31:17.366]  And my philosophy with products we sell to fund ourselves is very simple.
[02:31:18.087 --> 02:31:26.995]  Sell the highest quality that I, myself, and my family take, give it to you at a great price so that it's a win-win, so you continue to want to come back and get it over and over again.
[02:31:27.616 --> 02:31:31.099]  We're running two new specials for one week and one week only.
[02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:33.181]  The biggest one ever is
[02:31:34.625 --> 02:31:36.306]  X2, we were able to get back in stock.
[02:31:36.486 --> 02:31:37.947]  Deep Earth pure iodine crystals.
[02:31:38.768 --> 02:31:42.010]  Read about iodine deficiency, how it has lower IQs, you don't have it.
[02:31:42.430 --> 02:31:44.952]  Boosted IQs, how it's the building block of the whole body.
[02:31:45.492 --> 02:31:47.193]  Just as essential as water or oxygen.
[02:31:47.514 --> 02:31:49.995]  We have the true pure iodine that you can absorb.
[02:31:50.676 --> 02:31:52.037]  About 98% of people can.
[02:31:53.037 --> 02:31:55.259]  And it's just a game changer.
[02:31:55.619 --> 02:31:56.540]  We have it back in stock.
[02:31:56.600 --> 02:31:59.181]  And when you get one bottle of X2, already 25% off.
[02:31:59.882 --> 02:32:00.723]  Already a great deal.
[02:32:03.703 --> 02:32:07.144]  You get a free bottle of X3.
[02:32:07.724 --> 02:32:08.545]  Absolutely free.
[02:32:08.945 --> 02:32:13.046]  Now, we sat out with top scientists and said, could we make X2 better?
[02:32:13.086 --> 02:32:14.426]  This has the deep-earth crystals in it.
[02:32:14.486 --> 02:32:14.947]  X3 does.
[02:32:15.227 --> 02:32:16.067]  And they said, yes.
[02:32:16.747 --> 02:32:23.069]  You'd have the other two types of iodine in there because a low percentage of people cannot absorb pure iodine.
[02:32:23.469 --> 02:32:25.210]  Just like most people can't absorb
[02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:27.992]  Iodine that isn't atomic.
[02:32:28.453 --> 02:32:29.414]  So again, it's X-22.
[02:32:29.434 --> 02:32:31.916]  So we created X-3.
[02:32:32.377 --> 02:32:35.380]  Now, X-3 is weaker on purpose.
[02:32:35.760 --> 02:32:38.623]  Because again, some people can't handle the strongest iodine.
[02:32:38.964 --> 02:32:42.447]  Consult your physician before you take it, because this is real stuff.
[02:32:43.288 --> 02:32:48.929]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, get a bottle of X2 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:49.409 --> 02:32:56.851]  Incredibly popular, thousands of five-star reviews, and get a free bottle of X3 so you can experience how amazing it is as well.
[02:32:57.271 --> 02:33:00.552]  InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:33:01.012 --> 02:33:02.152]  Thank you so much for your support.
[02:33:06.793 --> 02:33:09.474]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:27.289 --> 02:33:31.031]  Man, I love my garage.
[02:33:31.051 --> 02:33:34.732]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.893 --> 02:33:39.074]  I'm high as a kite on freedom!
[02:33:40.534 --> 02:33:42.515]  We are in a real war, folks.
[02:33:43.156 --> 02:33:45.476]  Not some chicken-you-know-what war.
[02:33:46.117 --> 02:33:49.478]  Not some garbage globalist war, but a real war to restore the republic.
[02:33:50.498 --> 02:33:53.940]  And all my bones, all my ancestors, all my spirit says,
[02:33:55.066 --> 02:33:56.086]  You're doing good, boy.
[02:33:56.106 --> 02:33:58.227]  We want more.
[02:33:58.247 --> 02:33:59.167]  We want it now.
[02:33:59.767 --> 02:34:00.768]  Here's all the power.
[02:34:01.808 --> 02:34:03.128]  Ha, ha, ha, ha!
[02:34:03.989 --> 02:34:08.230]  Everything these little chicken crap gloveless cheek they'll never have because they're trash.
[02:34:09.150 --> 02:34:12.151]  They're not going to get power because they don't deserve it.
[02:34:12.451 --> 02:34:14.712]  And I don't want the power, and neither do you.
[02:34:15.772 --> 02:34:17.832]  But you're not going to let them run your life, are you?
[02:34:18.633 --> 02:34:20.133]  They think they control you.
[02:34:20.153 --> 02:34:22.834]  They're going to tell you what to think and what to do, but they're not.
[02:34:23.544 --> 02:34:25.105]  Let's crank up some more of this great classical music.
[02:34:25.125 --> 02:34:31.107]  I see it as classical.
[02:34:31.127 --> 02:34:32.088]  Are we getting Millie Weaver on?
[02:34:32.108 --> 02:34:37.190]  I got stacks of incredible news and information and so much more, but let me tell you the real joy of this sucker.
[02:34:38.451 --> 02:34:40.992]  That's staying on the air in the face of the globalists.
[02:34:41.632 --> 02:34:49.656]  You know, if I went over all the things they've done to us and all the things I haven't told you about this week and all the stuff that happens,
[02:34:51.056 --> 02:34:53.538]  I just always see one door closes, another door opens.
[02:34:54.579 --> 02:35:00.863]  And it's our mission to stay in the 2020 election and to get Trump back in, to keep his feet to the fire, to restore the republic.
[02:35:01.524 --> 02:35:04.326]  And I tend to keep M4s going after that because there will always be work to do.
[02:35:04.406 --> 02:35:09.009]  But I would love to retire like Bilbo Baggins.
[02:35:10.330 --> 02:35:14.212]  The ring of Mordor carrying around in my pocket is not a very fun thing to do.
[02:35:14.313 --> 02:35:15.874]  Let's just leave it at that.
[02:35:17.286 --> 02:35:21.850]  I just want to halfway get the country back on even keel so it's not total crisis mode.
[02:35:23.352 --> 02:35:32.600]  But I can't recede into the shadows, even though I've done 25 years of this, because they are literally trying to destroy me every minute, every second.
[02:35:34.041 --> 02:35:37.945]  Now listen, and I've said this a hundred times, I'll say it again, do you understand
[02:35:40.217 --> 02:35:44.878]  That I would never sell you something that I didn't think was the best and that I don't use.
[02:35:45.558 --> 02:35:47.439]  Yes, I'm a very superstitious person.
[02:35:48.399 --> 02:35:53.701]  I'm so superstitious, it's not like something I have in an external capacity.
[02:35:53.821 --> 02:35:59.382]  Like, oh, I read books on superstition or I study superstition.
[02:35:59.982 --> 02:36:02.083]  I don't study anything in books.
[02:36:02.323 --> 02:36:03.463]  I'm superstitious.
[02:36:05.124 --> 02:36:06.144]  I've never started a fight.
[02:36:07.526 --> 02:36:12.809]  I've never stolen from anybody other than beer out of golf carts when I was a teenager, and I'm ashamed of that.
[02:36:13.610 --> 02:36:15.871]  And I've never gotten off on screwing someone over.
[02:36:19.233 --> 02:36:24.917]  But I have enjoyed it when somebody's beating the hell out of me to get that left hook in and break their jaw and get them off me.
[02:36:25.877 --> 02:36:28.079]  The joy of victory, the joy of defense.
[02:36:29.119 --> 02:36:30.960]  But I just want listeners to understand something.
[02:36:31.021 --> 02:36:32.802]  We are the center of the storm.
[02:36:33.689 --> 02:36:34.049]  You are.
[02:36:34.490 --> 02:36:35.631]  You're the Americans they fear.
[02:36:35.671 --> 02:36:44.778]  You're the people that, through the thousands of choices, tens of thousands of choices, hell, millions of choices online, you chose InfoWars.
[02:36:44.898 --> 02:36:47.640]  You've dialed in, and now you see the proofs in the pudding.
[02:36:49.001 --> 02:36:50.503]  And it's just like our products.
[02:36:52.044 --> 02:36:55.807]  I mean, I'll tell you, the one product we have that is not the best there is.
[02:36:56.868 --> 02:36:58.649]  I'll tell you it, because I'm just not that skilled at it.
[02:36:58.889 --> 02:36:59.470]  It's our T-shirts.
[02:37:01.781 --> 02:37:03.701]  Some of our t-shirts are really good.
[02:37:06.182 --> 02:37:07.442]  Some of our t-shirts are okay.
[02:37:07.462 --> 02:37:09.863]  A lot of the t-shirts I designed suck.
[02:37:11.763 --> 02:37:15.544]  And that's because I can't figure out how to come up with good ideas like Mark Dice.
[02:37:15.924 --> 02:37:17.184]  His t-shirts are awesome, go buy some.
[02:37:17.884 --> 02:37:18.604]  Seriously, support him.
[02:37:19.505 --> 02:37:20.185]  They're all genius.
[02:37:21.865 --> 02:37:28.406]  But everything else, I can go to the top scientists, top companies, top reviews, and I can bring you the best supplements!
[02:37:30.007 --> 02:37:31.187]  My t-shirts are not the best.
[02:37:32.409 --> 02:37:35.813]  Some have really nice fabric and are, you know, the top 5%, but they're not the best.
[02:37:37.375 --> 02:37:39.737]  Our turmeric bodies is the best.
[02:37:40.218 --> 02:37:41.639]  Our fish oil is the best.
[02:37:41.719 --> 02:37:42.580]  You're going to find out there.
[02:37:44.122 --> 02:37:45.964]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is the best.
[02:37:47.225 --> 02:37:50.569]  Our nootropic is the best, unless you spend $200 a bottle.
[02:37:52.728 --> 02:38:00.470]  The industry, when I put out BrainForce four years ago, got so angry because it's a copy of some of the top brands out there.
[02:38:00.490 --> 02:38:03.111]  I mean, not a total copy, but we made it stronger and better.
[02:38:03.551 --> 02:38:05.872]  They were selling it for $100, $80 a bottle.
[02:38:06.292 --> 02:38:15.035]  I made the industry drop brain pill nootropics like TurboForce from an average of $80 down to about $60 because we offer it at $40, always discount at $29.95.
[02:38:17.236 --> 02:38:20.080]  Nobody puts $10 a product in something like this.
[02:38:20.140 --> 02:38:22.402]  They put $2 in it and mark it up seven times.
[02:38:23.103 --> 02:38:23.944]  I don't do that.
[02:38:24.065 --> 02:38:25.586]  I tell you exactly what's going on.
[02:38:26.908 --> 02:38:30.573]  So that's what I'm getting at here is, everyone needs to understand that
[02:38:31.738 --> 02:38:32.679]  The water filtration.
[02:38:33.319 --> 02:38:36.281]  People say, well, you say you have the best water filtration, you sell five different types.
[02:38:36.821 --> 02:38:38.042]  Well, one is the best shower.
[02:38:38.502 --> 02:38:39.342]  One is the best bath.
[02:38:39.943 --> 02:38:44.105]  There are two or three gravity feds that you could argue, one's better at this, one better at that.
[02:38:44.505 --> 02:38:51.369]  I sit there and look at the big toxicity studies and, well, one's better at this and one's better at that, but it's all 9, 9, 9, 9, 9 percent reduction.
[02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:53.290]  So, Alexa Pure Pro is great.
[02:38:54.131 --> 02:38:54.891]  Pro Pure is great.
[02:38:56.472 --> 02:38:59.354]  We've got the biggest sales ever going on on Alexa Pure Pro right now.
[02:39:00.347 --> 02:39:02.768]  So, if it's air filtration, here's how my brain works.
[02:39:02.848 --> 02:39:07.370]  You can buy a six-stage ion electrical filter that's $1,000.
[02:39:07.410 --> 02:39:10.151]  You can buy four stages all day long for $500.
[02:39:10.191 --> 02:39:11.652]  They used to be $600, $700.
[02:39:13.053 --> 02:39:14.393]  Alexa Pure Breeze is normally $250.
[02:39:15.013 --> 02:39:15.834]  That's a great deal.
[02:39:16.754 --> 02:39:17.014]  I make $50, $60.
[02:39:17.214 --> 02:39:18.315]  They make $50, $60.
[02:39:19.175 --> 02:39:20.856]  When they discount it, I make like $30.
[02:39:20.916 --> 02:39:22.537]  They make nothing.
[02:39:24.077 --> 02:39:25.978]  At $199, I'm making like $40 or making like $20.
[02:39:28.220 --> 02:39:31.282]  Now we sell a lot more of them because, you know, it's a great deal.
[02:39:31.322 --> 02:39:32.502]  It's a four-stage ion filter.
[02:39:32.803 --> 02:39:34.123]  Could you spend a thousand and get better?
[02:39:34.363 --> 02:39:35.644]  Yeah, not much better.
[02:39:37.145 --> 02:39:44.089]  So that's what I'm getting at here is my philosophy and what I stand for and how we fund ourselves and what we do.
[02:39:45.850 --> 02:39:51.213]  That the only thing we produce that is not the best on the market at a lower price is
[02:39:53.547 --> 02:39:54.087]  The t-shirts.
[02:39:54.928 --> 02:40:01.312]  I mean, technically, shortwave radios go up and down in price all the time, so maybe we don't... Last time, a year ago, I set deals on seeds.
[02:40:01.332 --> 02:40:02.533]  We had the best deals in the industry.
[02:40:02.933 --> 02:40:03.713]  Maybe they're not now.
[02:40:03.753 --> 02:40:07.556]  The point is, I'm trying hard here, and I make it easy to support us.
[02:40:07.576 --> 02:40:13.359]  As if I was selling a coffee cup for a hundred bucks like a mug club, like, like, uh, Steven Crowder.
[02:40:13.439 --> 02:40:14.260]  Buy the damn thing.
[02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:16.101]  It doesn't matter it cost him eight bucks a mug.
[02:40:16.121 --> 02:40:17.422]  He's got to pay that old crew.
[02:40:18.723 --> 02:40:19.723]  We sell mugs for 15 bucks.
[02:40:21.246 --> 02:40:22.847]  And I'm not in competition with Crowder.
[02:40:23.227 --> 02:40:30.651]  I'm saying I can't stop neurotically giving you the best deal I can because I can't not do it.
[02:40:31.492 --> 02:40:32.692]  And I got warned by marketers.
[02:40:33.773 --> 02:40:36.815]  They said, listen, you keep discounting stuff 40, 50 percent.
[02:40:36.895 --> 02:40:38.616]  People are going to only buy when you do that.
[02:40:39.336 --> 02:40:42.778]  And it's fine if you mark up stuff seven times, but you don't, Mr. Jones.
[02:40:43.719 --> 02:40:46.860]  You're not going to run this operation making 10, 20 percent on a product.
[02:40:48.461 --> 02:40:48.862]  And it's true.
[02:40:50.134 --> 02:40:51.815]  And I've walked myself into that situation.
[02:40:51.955 --> 02:40:54.177]  And I don't know how to un-walk it with the audience.
[02:40:55.739 --> 02:40:58.381]  So, there is no marketing here.
[02:40:58.421 --> 02:41:00.102]  There is no advisors.
[02:41:00.322 --> 02:41:01.283]  I've tried to have meetings.
[02:41:01.323 --> 02:41:02.164]  I've tried to figure it out.
[02:41:02.224 --> 02:41:03.345]  I just can't stop what I'm doing.
[02:41:03.785 --> 02:41:04.726]  I just believe in you.
[02:41:05.446 --> 02:41:08.048]  And I know, they even had Vice Magazine do a big study.
[02:41:08.925 --> 02:41:12.167]  And I knew they'd always pick one product, say it was good, look reasonable, and then attack all the others.
[02:41:12.187 --> 02:41:16.409]  It was all bull BS, except that they said, God, this is like the best coffee we ever drank.
[02:41:16.489 --> 02:41:22.291]  Well, I mean, I went out and found the top-rated coffee from Southern Mexico and Chiapas that's beyond organic.
[02:41:22.351 --> 02:41:25.093]  It's handcrafted, hand-picked, and I love it.
[02:41:25.833 --> 02:41:28.914]  And then I discount it $10 less a pound than Whole Foods sells it.
[02:41:30.395 --> 02:41:31.476]  That's what we're doing.
[02:41:31.996 --> 02:41:33.337]  And so right now, you can get X3
[02:41:36.431 --> 02:41:41.778]  For free, the great iodine supplement, the Missing Link, when you get a bottle of X2, 25% off.
[02:41:41.818 --> 02:41:46.844]  And listen, I couldn't get the Deep Earth mining operations to give it to us anymore.
[02:41:46.864 --> 02:41:52.011]  They found out who we were, they wanted like, you know, equivalent of like 30 bucks a bottle to do it instead of like 10 bucks a bottle.
[02:41:52.031 --> 02:41:52.571]  We couldn't do it.
[02:41:53.464 --> 02:41:54.825]  So I played guts ball and said, screw you.
[02:41:55.266 --> 02:41:58.529]  I finally found another company that could get the very same deep earth crystals.
[02:41:59.289 --> 02:42:00.250]  But then they convinced me.
[02:42:00.290 --> 02:42:02.132]  They said, listen, we think your stuff's a little strong.
[02:42:02.152 --> 02:42:03.473]  You know, the FDA says you can do this.
[02:42:04.033 --> 02:42:08.597]  You should put in two different types of iodine for triiodine to make sure all of it gets absorbed.
[02:42:09.018 --> 02:42:12.481]  I could have had X3 be X2 and be the same crystals.
[02:42:12.721 --> 02:42:15.383]  I really thought it would be better because I was told so.
[02:42:15.844 --> 02:42:16.424]  Doesn't matter.
[02:42:16.524 --> 02:42:18.046]  You want X2, you get X2.
[02:42:19.607 --> 02:42:20.168]  It is stronger.
[02:42:20.228 --> 02:42:20.568]  Be careful.
[02:42:22.366 --> 02:42:30.820]  The point is, X3, free bottle, you get a bottle of X2, and I'm gonna explain to you again, all your hormones, everything is built off this.
[02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:33.123]  This is the missing link, this is the engine.
[02:42:34.275 --> 02:42:35.595]  Just like oxygen, just like water.
[02:42:36.015 --> 02:42:36.536]  This is it.
[02:42:36.556 --> 02:42:38.136]  You're like, well, I got oxygen, I got water.
[02:42:38.476 --> 02:42:40.376]  Yeah, you don't have clean iodine.
[02:42:40.576 --> 02:42:41.057]  We have it.
[02:42:41.357 --> 02:42:42.277]  Nobody else has it.
[02:42:42.877 --> 02:42:44.077]  The special just got launched.
[02:42:44.117 --> 02:42:44.817]  No reviews yet.
[02:42:45.137 --> 02:42:47.318]  Thousands of five-star reviews for the product separately.
[02:42:47.338 --> 02:42:52.019]  Get it today at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:42:52.419 --> 02:42:54.660]  And you are funding the war machine!
[02:42:55.140 --> 02:42:58.480]  Committed people who won't back down, who won't give in.
[02:42:58.781 --> 02:43:00.581]  But if you don't support us, we could give out.
[02:43:03.172 --> 02:43:06.313]  Why has America been so special compared to other nations?
[02:43:07.514 --> 02:43:10.215]  Why has it become the model of other successful countries?
[02:43:10.555 --> 02:43:12.015]  Why do so many people want to get here?
[02:43:12.756 --> 02:43:17.717]  Because of our constitutional republic and the basic freedoms that were protected for the individual.
[02:43:18.258 --> 02:43:24.480]  Even though we've had a lot of problems, the fact that we were the freest country in the world allowed incredible wealth to be developed.
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:26.921]  By the 1950s, the U.S.
[02:43:26.941 --> 02:43:32.503]  had over 80% of the world's patents and over half the wealth, and the biggest middle class the planet had ever seen.
[02:43:33.263 --> 02:43:37.225]  It was America that led the way on human rights, not just here, but around the world.
[02:43:38.103 --> 02:43:43.526]  But if you tune into the national news today, like CNN, you'd believe America was the worst place on Earth.
[02:43:43.906 --> 02:43:44.867]  And it's a horrible place.
[02:43:45.327 --> 02:43:45.827]  And why is that?
[02:43:45.847 --> 02:43:53.231]  It's because multinational corporations, working with the Communist Chinese, the EU and others, are demoralizing the nation to break us down.
[02:43:53.772 --> 02:43:57.554]  And to make us not care about our identity, so we can be absorbed into globalism.
[02:43:58.254 --> 02:44:06.658]  But thanks to InfoWars and thanks to the audience of activists out there, we have rebooted Americana and the resistance against the globalists.
[02:44:07.078 --> 02:44:12.100]  And now Trump coming in and turning the tide and exposing the whole fake Russiagate has them panicked.
[02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:17.582]  Nationalist populists are being elected in South America, in Europe, in the UK.
[02:44:17.923 --> 02:44:20.824]  It's happening everywhere and the power structure is panicking.
[02:44:21.638 --> 02:44:36.388]  That's why Big Tech, allied with the Chi-Coms, the authoritarian EU and others, are forcing the whole Hollywood, hate America, brainwashing on the public and bringing in censorship in an attempt to block us from completing the take back of the nation.
[02:44:36.828 --> 02:44:38.690]  And that's why, more than ever, you have to remember,
[02:44:39.090 --> 02:44:52.593]  Because of the censorship, you've got to come to newswars.com or infowars.com to hear what's really happening on the front lines and how you can help, not just save the country, but really the future destiny of the people of this planet.
[02:44:53.073 --> 02:45:02.295]  Because if the United States falls to tyranny and falls to leftist authoritarianism, the communist Chinese will be the dominant cultural force on the planet.
[02:45:03.325 --> 02:45:18.205]  That's why it's so critical that we understand that Democrats in Congress right now are attempting to bring in more draconian censorship of conservatives and others, while at the same time big tech heads lie to Congress and say they're not censoring when they've been caught red-handed.
[02:45:19.221 --> 02:45:24.583]  This is the legislative branch, and we need to take control of it to restore the republic.
[02:45:24.863 --> 02:45:31.145]  We also have to take control of the judicial, and that takes us to our next spot, the Supreme Court.
[02:45:31.265 --> 02:45:34.206]  Imagine what would have happened if Hillary Clinton would have been elected.
[02:45:34.666 --> 02:45:44.490]  It would have been a death blow to this country, because the Democrats now officially say they want to repeal the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms, and so many other issues.
[02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:47.111]  This nation is still held by a threat.
[02:45:47.884 --> 02:45:53.588]  That's why it's so important to understand that the Democrats are the party of extremism, extreme anti-Americanism.
[02:45:53.948 --> 02:46:00.813]  The Republicans were a bunch of blue blood establishment types, but we've had a populist insurrection that has partially taken it over.
[02:46:01.413 --> 02:46:13.001]  Now we've got to take it all the way over, keep Trump in the White House in 2020, and get more governorships and more state houses across this country to reverse the globalist plan to take down our nation.
[02:46:13.021 --> 02:46:14.922]  And that's why InfoWars is so important.
[02:46:15.262 --> 02:46:16.863]  InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:46:18.044 --> 02:46:21.928]  Tomorrow's news today that will only get through to the people if you spread the word.
[02:46:23.030 --> 02:46:25.873]  Just while I've been out here walking today, I probably shook a hundred hands.
[02:46:26.593 --> 02:46:28.716]  And a third of them said, where are you?
[02:46:28.796 --> 02:46:29.657]  We miss you.
[02:46:30.277 --> 02:46:31.519]  We wish you were still on air.
[02:46:32.420 --> 02:46:37.044]  That's because they were habitualized on YouTube and on iTunes and everywhere else to listen to us.
[02:46:37.901 --> 02:46:40.702]  You have to come to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:46:40.743 --> 02:46:46.245]  And I know the regular listeners understand that, but other people kind of just passively watch what pops up on their screen.
[02:46:46.606 --> 02:46:52.088]  They love the truth, they love liberty, but they're not thinking that there's an internet outside of Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.
[02:46:52.449 --> 02:46:54.990]  That's why you are how we outreach.
[02:46:55.130 --> 02:46:59.452]  You are how we get this information through the sensors to others.
[02:47:00.013 --> 02:47:01.273]  You are the resistance.
[02:47:01.553 --> 02:47:02.414]  So God bless you all.
[02:47:06.272 --> 02:47:20.981]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:23.422 --> 02:47:29.986]  Well, you've got your diamonds, and you've got your pretty clothes.
[02:47:31.019 --> 02:47:39.866]  Oh, the Antifa says they're going to target conservatives at their homes.
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:13.084]  All right, Millie Weaver joins us.
[02:48:13.344 --> 02:48:19.788]  Her and the great Caitlin Bennett have been out filing incredible reports to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and you gotta go to their YouTube channels.
[02:48:19.808 --> 02:48:21.009]  They're their own reporters as well.
[02:48:21.049 --> 02:48:21.890]  They just do work for us.
[02:48:25.946 --> 02:48:27.427]  There's like an hour of video.
[02:48:27.467 --> 02:48:29.688]  There's this showing Biden might have had 400 people.
[02:48:30.249 --> 02:48:31.389]  She's got that exclusive footage.
[02:48:31.409 --> 02:48:32.870]  We've got to get an article out about that.
[02:48:33.411 --> 02:48:35.692]  They've got them trying to arrest Caitlyn Bennett for no reason.
[02:48:35.812 --> 02:48:38.353]  Again, last time that happened two weeks ago, it got 50 million views.
[02:48:38.534 --> 02:48:39.254]  It's up to that now.
[02:48:40.475 --> 02:48:41.555]  There's all this insanity.
[02:48:41.575 --> 02:48:44.117]  So we're going to... Tom Papert's coming up about 15 to the next hour.
[02:48:44.697 --> 02:48:48.719]  One of our TV station managers, great talk show host, but he's happy to let us take over because I got Millie on late.
[02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:54.102]  Millie, this is his first big rally in Ohio, his second rally, his first rally.
[02:48:54.443 --> 02:48:56.604]  I know he had part of his brain removed from a stroke he had.
[02:48:56.644 --> 02:48:57.704]  I'm not making jokes about that.
[02:48:57.724 --> 02:48:58.805]  I've had family diastrokes.
[02:48:59.385 --> 02:49:02.327]  I don't even wish any harm upon Biden, even though he's a globalist traitor.
[02:49:03.328 --> 02:49:05.089]  But I'm sure you saw him slurring his words.
[02:49:05.129 --> 02:49:06.429]  And I mean, this was not drunkenness.
[02:49:06.449 --> 02:49:08.831]  This was cognitive mental illness or
[02:49:09.711 --> 02:49:11.114]  Or mental degradation, in my view.
[02:49:19.670 --> 02:49:26.472]  Well, you know, his poor cognitive health isn't going to stop the establishment from having them as his pick, as we saw with Hillary Clinton.
[02:49:26.812 --> 02:49:31.833]  And I can say from what I've been seeing, Joe Biden is definitely the establishment's pick.
[02:49:32.213 --> 02:49:37.714]  Well, he had, at most, about 300 attendees go to his rally.
[02:49:38.054 --> 02:49:42.535]  The building he was in had a 240 occupancy rating.
[02:49:43.155 --> 02:49:46.036]  And the tip is, notice how close the camera is.
[02:49:47.350 --> 02:49:47.791]  I don't
[02:50:05.950 --> 02:50:13.198]  By the way, I don't mean to interrupt you, but TV viewers may get confused, because you voiced the piece earlier, we're going to play in a moment.
[02:50:13.699 --> 02:50:22.570]  You show Biden about 300, but then you show Trump shows thousands, so I want to be clear that the last clip people saw was Trump having a big rally.
[02:50:23.618 --> 02:50:24.979]  Yes, we're comparing.
[02:50:25.099 --> 02:50:26.740]  This is what Biden's rallies look like.
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:30.243]  They have to be super zoomed in so they don't show he has a small turnout.
[02:50:30.603 --> 02:50:33.645]  Whereas Trump's, he's filling up mega stadiums.
[02:50:34.066 --> 02:50:36.787]  It's tens of thousands of people going to Trump rallies.
[02:50:37.508 --> 02:50:41.251]  By the way, Millie, you're married, I'm married, you got two great children, I got four.
[02:50:41.291 --> 02:50:43.772]  But I do admire you as a beautiful, smart woman.
[02:50:44.273 --> 02:50:47.595]  I mean, you weren't so beautiful, I still admire you for your great tenacity.
[02:50:47.615 --> 02:50:51.178]  But I just, as a man, I'm threatened by you on a 20-foot screen up there.
[02:50:51.718 --> 02:50:52.338]  Actually, I love it.
[02:50:52.478 --> 02:50:54.119]  I just love seeing you up there.
[02:50:54.599 --> 02:50:55.260]  It's so good.
[02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:57.901]  Oh my gosh.
[02:50:57.961 --> 02:51:00.963]  I feel like I look like Godzilla on this big screen.
[02:51:01.003 --> 02:51:01.623]  I love it.
[02:51:01.743 --> 02:51:02.123]  I love it.
[02:51:02.863 --> 02:51:06.005]  Why am I so excited about a powerful, smart mother up there?
[02:51:06.025 --> 02:51:09.126]  I got shivers looking at you up there.
[02:51:09.607 --> 02:51:09.987]  I love it.
[02:51:11.232 --> 02:51:12.173]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:51:12.213 --> 02:51:15.996]  You know, it's crazy being out there with these leftists.
[02:51:16.076 --> 02:51:19.579]  And I'll tell you, the leftists are getting more and more deranged.
[02:51:19.719 --> 02:51:25.844]  Even after it came out that there was no proof of collusion for Trump and Russia, they are doubling down.
[02:51:25.884 --> 02:51:26.905]  They are so mad.
[02:51:27.005 --> 02:51:29.767]  And, you know, I just put up several reports.
[02:51:29.787 --> 02:51:30.668]  That was my next question.
[02:51:30.768 --> 02:51:31.969]  And we've got plenty of time in the next hour.
[02:51:32.529 --> 02:51:34.931]  They're acting more crazy to me on the street now.
[02:51:35.051 --> 02:51:36.913]  So you said you got video.
[02:51:36.953 --> 02:51:37.934]  They are crazy now.
[02:51:39.016 --> 02:51:40.237]  Oh yeah, it's escalating.
[02:51:40.297 --> 02:51:41.398]  A woman threatened me.
[02:51:42.238 --> 02:51:47.342]  I know with Caitlin Bennett, she was recently kicked off of a college campus just for being there.
[02:51:48.102 --> 02:51:49.584]  People called the police on her.
[02:51:49.724 --> 02:51:52.446]  I mean, the left is only escalating.
[02:51:52.546 --> 02:51:53.606]  They're getting more and more crazy.
[02:51:53.646 --> 02:51:56.088]  We're going to play some of this coming up next hour.
[02:51:56.148 --> 02:51:59.370]  It's all on InfoWars.com, but you're a veteran of Charlottesville.
[02:51:59.390 --> 02:52:00.471]  You're a veteran of hundreds of these.
[02:52:00.791 --> 02:52:04.174]  For you to say it's escalating, describe how you say it's escalating.
[02:52:05.509 --> 02:52:10.067]  Well, your average, run-of-the-mill, regular, you know, cat lady.
[02:52:12.114 --> 02:52:13.715]  Is getting more and more hyped up.
[02:52:13.855 --> 02:52:22.038]  I'm not saying that Antifa is out there, but your average American is getting more emotionally invested and more emotionally incontinent.
[02:52:23.279 --> 02:52:26.160]  They can't contain themselves.
[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:35.704]  They're doubling down, and because of that, they're holding on to lies and misinformation, and they're just basing their opinions on emotion.
[02:52:35.724 --> 02:52:38.585]  So it's cognitive dissonance, as you said, emotional incontinence.
[02:52:38.605 --> 02:52:40.325]  I mean, that's it.
[02:52:40.385 --> 02:52:41.466]  They're going crazy.
[02:52:42.802 --> 02:52:47.906]  Yes, and a lot of them were full of misinformation about you, Alex Jones.
[02:52:48.526 --> 02:52:53.470]  I know that they had said so many different things about you that just absolutely wasn't true.
[02:52:53.490 --> 02:52:56.853]  I mean, these people don't believe certain things.
[02:52:56.933 --> 02:52:59.395]  I mean, just as much as they have misinformation about Trump.
[02:52:59.415 --> 02:53:01.997]  Oh, I remember ten years ago in Pittsburgh, a white supremacist
[02:53:02.637 --> 02:53:06.200]  Killed three police officers, and then the Southern Providence Law Center got his computer.
[02:53:06.540 --> 02:53:08.281]  He visited my site amongst thousands.
[02:53:08.922 --> 02:53:10.523]  And it later came out on his message board.
[02:53:10.543 --> 02:53:11.724]  He said, I want to get Alex Jones.
[02:53:11.764 --> 02:53:12.785]  I want to kill Alex Jones.
[02:53:13.285 --> 02:53:16.708]  The left chants now their new thing is, I killed three police officers.
[02:53:17.428 --> 02:53:23.093]  And I guess they were chanting that at you, even though when they actually got his computer, they found he was saying he wanted to kill me.
[02:53:24.033 --> 02:53:25.974]  Oh yeah, this guy hated you.
[02:53:26.114 --> 02:53:28.275]  He was not one of your fans and supporters.
[02:53:28.715 --> 02:53:38.259]  And at the same time, these are the same leftists that want to try to say, hey, you know, Islam, ISIS isn't encouraging a bunch of terrorism, right?
[02:53:38.339 --> 02:53:40.140]  They'll defend ISIS and Islam.
[02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:53.890]  But they won't, but at the same time they say, oh you can't make those associations when we when we call out ISIS, but yet they're gonna make these associations with Alex Jones who this guy hated you Alex.
[02:53:54.611 --> 02:53:59.174]  We're gonna play some of this coming up but I just while you're here I want to have you be able to break it down.
[02:54:01.109 --> 02:54:01.630]  You're tough.
[02:54:01.730 --> 02:54:03.191]  You've been pepper sprayed by the left.
[02:54:03.211 --> 02:54:03.832]  You've been attacked.
[02:54:04.353 --> 02:54:06.555]  You've seen all these new videos of Antifa attacking people.
[02:54:06.996 --> 02:54:12.422]  A whole bunch of former CIA counterterrorism experts and the FBI are now officially saying they've been to the meetings.
[02:54:12.682 --> 02:54:13.263]  I've been to them.
[02:54:13.283 --> 02:54:14.584]  That's how we first broke it last year.
[02:54:15.125 --> 02:54:18.048]  Antifa's linked up with MS-13 as planning mass killings.
[02:54:18.869 --> 02:54:21.893]  So how long until they launch a bunch of Charlie Manson type stuff?
[02:54:23.331 --> 02:54:30.295]  Well, I think Antifa, we will start to see the left get worse, especially if Trump wins in 2020.
[02:54:31.016 --> 02:54:37.679]  I really feel like if Trump wins in 2020, we can expect the year of 2020 to be civil unrest.
[02:54:37.739 --> 02:54:39.941]  The left is going to go insane.
[02:54:39.961 --> 02:54:40.241]  Oh, I agree.
[02:54:40.261 --> 02:54:41.502]  I think you're going to see cities burn.
[02:54:42.571 --> 02:54:44.773]  So they're trying to compose themselves.
[02:54:44.793 --> 02:54:45.674]  But aren't you proud?
[02:54:45.694 --> 02:54:46.755]  I don't say this patronizingly.
[02:54:46.795 --> 02:54:47.216]  I'm serious.
[02:54:47.276 --> 02:54:48.477]  I'm proud of Americans.
[02:54:49.118 --> 02:54:52.621]  Even the Mueller report admits no one would take Russian money.
[02:54:53.282 --> 02:55:02.732]  They couldn't get one American to do it and they funded race riot stuff in every city with TV shows and movies and they couldn't get any black Americans to take the bait.
[02:55:02.972 --> 02:55:05.815]  I am damn proud right now of African Americans.
[02:55:07.239 --> 02:55:19.286]  Yeah, I'm proud of Americans, too, and it just goes to show how ridiculous and subversive the mainstream media's claims were that Trump is best friends with Putin and that he was colluding with the Russians.
[02:55:19.326 --> 02:55:23.588]  And then he's in the KKK when he said white supremacists are terrible, and then he says they're great.
[02:55:23.908 --> 02:55:25.029]  Well, show us the clip, then!
[02:55:25.189 --> 02:55:27.110]  Because you don't have it, you damn liars!
[02:55:28.551 --> 02:55:33.254]  Oh, but that's one of the things I questioned people at this rally, and I have an amazing report up.
[02:55:33.294 --> 02:55:35.055]  That's the name of your video, yeah.
[02:55:36.236 --> 02:55:37.678]  Go ahead and tell people about it.
[02:55:38.518 --> 02:55:42.882]  It's about how the left is trying to shrug off Joe Biden's racist past.
[02:55:42.902 --> 02:55:43.543]  That's the name.
[02:55:43.563 --> 02:55:46.025]  Dems shrug Joe Biden's racist past.
[02:55:46.852 --> 02:56:09.757]  So initially I asked them like I say Trump has this racist past where he advocated for segregation in 1975 and get them to condemn it and they're all oh it's so bad he's so racist he's so vile you know of course he would and then I say well actually that was Joe Biden and then I get their responses and they try to like downplay or shrug it off and some you know it's interesting to see
[02:56:10.357 --> 02:56:20.212]  The left's double standards, essentially, where it's okay that Joe Biden was advocating for segregation when he was running in Delaware in 1975.
[02:56:20.252 --> 02:56:20.973]  Let's be clear.
[02:56:25.057 --> 02:56:28.158]  Trump was the one then advocating for it.
[02:56:28.918 --> 02:56:30.078]  And I even agree with Biden.
[02:56:30.239 --> 02:56:30.919]  It's mean.
[02:56:31.019 --> 02:56:33.239]  Because my grandmother was a Republican, so was my grandfather.
[02:56:33.299 --> 02:56:34.740]  He was in government in East Texas.
[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:36.380]  They were for desegregation.
[02:56:36.420 --> 02:56:41.442]  They didn't want to bus all white kids and black kids to random schools 30 miles away.
[02:56:42.242 --> 02:56:42.863]  And make them do that.
[02:56:42.883 --> 02:56:44.686]  They're all for, yeah, go to whatever school you want.
[02:56:44.746 --> 02:56:46.548]  So I even get where Biden came from then.
[02:56:46.889 --> 02:56:53.638]  But you can't then say Trump's a KKK member when Trump was actually for busing and everything else, probably even too liberal for me.
[02:56:54.359 --> 02:56:55.421]  You can't get away with that.
[02:56:55.461 --> 02:56:56.081]  It's just not true.
[02:56:57.728 --> 02:57:00.449]  Yeah, the liberals will try to say anything.
[02:57:00.489 --> 02:57:07.891]  I think one lady even tried to claim that, you know, Trump's grandfather or father was a member of the KKK, which that's already been disproven.
[02:57:07.911 --> 02:57:08.851]  None of that's even true.
[02:57:08.891 --> 02:57:14.053]  And I mean, going back to that again, imagine you're a kid, you're three miles from your school, you're black or white.
[02:57:14.733 --> 02:57:16.314]  Why would you be bused 30 miles away?
[02:57:17.154 --> 02:57:23.897]  Sure, desegregate, let black kids go to the good white schools, but don't make people go 30 miles to their school.
[02:57:24.317 --> 02:57:30.000]  So I'm not even defending Biden, but according to his yardstick of all this, he's the worst guy in the world.
[02:57:31.670 --> 02:57:33.711]  Millie Weaver is always kicking ass.
[02:57:33.751 --> 02:57:35.952]  Just look at her if you're a TV viewer.
[02:57:36.493 --> 02:57:37.693]  She's got so much courage.
[02:57:38.134 --> 02:57:38.834]  She's a target.
[02:57:38.874 --> 02:57:40.095]  She marches into these fights.
[02:57:40.635 --> 02:57:43.157]  And you buying the products at Infomercial.com, fund her.
[02:57:43.557 --> 02:57:46.719]  And I got a bunch of other people I want to hire, but we need the money.
[02:57:46.739 --> 02:57:48.500]  We're prosecuting a war.
[02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:50.161]  Hit me with the cash!
[02:57:50.261 --> 02:57:50.661]  I need it!
[02:57:52.185 --> 02:57:52.485]  Frank, in
[02:58:10.729 --> 02:58:16.314]  Or oligopolies, groups of monopolies working together to dominate and control and consolidate power.
[02:58:16.794 --> 02:58:19.816]  This is how 21st century warfare is carried out.
[02:58:20.237 --> 02:58:30.185]  But nationalists and populists across the world have been awakened to this threat and are taking action to restore control over our lives back to our central and local governments.
[02:58:30.805 --> 02:58:34.447]  This is the fight that the United States is deeply in the middle of right now.
[02:58:34.887 --> 02:58:52.178]  And that's why the globalists, who were arrogant, are now panicking and trying to censor InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and my syndicated radio show because they know we've got our finger on the pulse of what's happening and that the President and the Pentagon and others are listening and know that we're telling the truth and we've basically become
[02:58:52.458 --> 02:58:55.861]  The modern Paul Revere transmission of this republic.
[02:58:56.321 --> 02:59:11.654]  That's why it's so critical for all of you out there watching and listening to remember, without you taking action, without you overcoming the censors, without you by word of mouth, with your human intelligence, overriding the AI censorship, we will be defeated and this restoration of the republic could be defeated.
[02:59:12.034 --> 02:59:16.977]  So please keep spreading the word, and whatever you do, remember, we're only financed now by you.
[02:59:17.477 --> 02:59:18.298]  We're in your hands.

[02:59:41.192 --> 02:59:41.432]  Thank you.
[03:00:09.389 --> 03:00:10.830]  I got me a rock and roll band.
[03:00:11.290 --> 03:00:12.231]  It's a free-for-all.
[03:00:13.191 --> 03:00:13.751]  Woo!
[03:00:15.252 --> 03:00:18.093]  Shake a tail feather, baby.
[03:00:36.422 --> 03:00:38.863]  Ah, Motor City Madman.
[03:00:38.883 --> 03:00:39.864]  Let's get him back on.
[03:00:39.964 --> 03:00:41.244]  Time to have him back on.
[03:00:43.405 --> 03:00:47.247]  He gets a little jealous of me.
[03:00:47.307 --> 03:00:49.488]  His wife's so in love with me.
[03:00:49.548 --> 03:00:50.529]  I'll be honest, though.
[03:00:50.549 --> 03:00:54.410]  No, but I mean, obviously, Mrs. Nugent likes alpha males.
[03:00:54.451 --> 03:00:55.351]  He's much tougher than I am.
[03:00:55.711 --> 03:00:57.652]  You know, Ted Nugent's an imposing figure in person.
[03:00:57.692 --> 03:00:58.873]  He's like, this is a real caveman.
[03:00:59.573 --> 03:01:00.653]  Caveman ain't stupid like Ted.
[03:01:00.673 --> 03:01:01.194]  He's smart.
[03:01:01.894 --> 03:01:02.434]  And psychic.
[03:01:03.315 --> 03:01:03.935]  Let's get serious.
[03:01:05.896 --> 03:01:06.156]  Woo!
[03:01:07.118 --> 03:01:13.907]  Millie Weaver is riding shotgun with us for a few more segments than Tom Papert, one of our great TV station managers, and an awesome talk show of his own right, takes over.
[03:01:14.588 --> 03:01:18.794]  Millie, we're going to play some of these clips in the next segment, but, you know...
[03:01:20.117 --> 03:01:22.019]  Instead of me asking questions, I got 50 of them.
[03:01:22.119 --> 03:01:24.781]  What do you want to say about what happened yesterday at Biden's event?
[03:01:25.121 --> 03:01:27.603]  And then I'm going to play this clip next segment of him slurring his words.
[03:01:27.623 --> 03:01:29.685]  And I was like, man, he's like he's having a stroke.
[03:01:30.105 --> 03:01:31.286]  So that's how members have had strokes.
[03:01:31.306 --> 03:01:32.247]  It's not a joking matter.
[03:01:32.847 --> 03:01:36.730]  And then and then one of our great researchers, Kit Daniels, walked in.
[03:01:36.750 --> 03:01:41.694]  He said, remember, he had brain surgery for a stroke and part of his brain removed like 10 years ago.
[03:01:41.754 --> 03:01:42.174]  And I was like.
[03:01:43.275 --> 03:01:50.401]  Oh, so I'm nothing against him being 75 or whatever, but he's the oldest person to ever run for president in a serious capacity.
[03:01:50.421 --> 03:01:53.404]  I just don't think Biden's got what it takes.
[03:01:53.424 --> 03:01:55.345]  He's older than Trump and hadn't been elected, Millie.
[03:01:56.526 --> 03:02:03.232]  Well, you know, at first I was hesitant to come out and tell people that Biden had such low
[03:02:03.982 --> 03:02:05.563]  No, they're going to steal the election!
[03:02:33.882 --> 03:02:38.384]  We're going to steal it with electronic votes, illegal alien votes, dead people are going to be voting.
[03:02:38.624 --> 03:02:43.226]  I mean, the Democrats are going to steal it, so we still need people to get out here and vote.
[03:02:43.266 --> 03:02:46.647]  Yeah, who's the bad guy that just got killed in Washington with my kids?
[03:02:47.067 --> 03:02:48.147]  Sunday was actually pretty good.
[03:02:48.428 --> 03:02:49.608]  Game of Thrones.
[03:02:49.628 --> 03:02:51.109]  Who's the Ice King and the Light King?
[03:02:51.149 --> 03:02:51.569]  What's his name?
[03:02:52.929 --> 03:02:53.529]  Oh, I don't know.
[03:02:53.549 --> 03:02:54.610]  I know who you're talking about.
[03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:55.230]  I don't know his name.
[03:02:55.270 --> 03:02:56.351]  I'm proud of our crew.
[03:02:56.371 --> 03:02:57.271]  What's the name of the bad guy?
[03:02:59.444 --> 03:03:00.044]  The Night King.
[03:03:00.885 --> 03:03:02.608]  We think we're going to win.
[03:03:02.668 --> 03:03:04.470]  No, the Democrats have the dead.
[03:03:04.490 --> 03:03:07.154]  They have the zombie force.
[03:03:07.614 --> 03:03:08.616]  You're right, the Night King.
[03:03:10.908 --> 03:03:14.211]  Yeah, they're going to use whatever means they can to steal the election.
[03:03:14.271 --> 03:03:15.171]  We are going to see that.
[03:03:15.231 --> 03:03:20.315]  So we still need people to flood the election to support Trump, essentially.
[03:03:20.436 --> 03:03:31.064]  Otherwise, if we don't, we are going to have Joe Biden, because he is the establishment pick that I can already guarantee most likely Bernie Sanders is going to kowtow to, just like last time.
[03:03:31.244 --> 03:03:33.266]  And both of them talk completely weird.
[03:03:34.166 --> 03:03:36.808]  One can't talk, the other talks like this.
[03:03:37.809 --> 03:03:38.770]  What are we going to do?
[03:03:39.311 --> 03:03:41.452]  I want control of the government to kill Christians.
[03:03:41.953 --> 03:03:43.334]  I love to kill... I'm sorry.
[03:03:43.774 --> 03:03:44.455]  Sorry, Millie.
[03:03:44.475 --> 03:03:44.935]  Go ahead.
[03:03:46.096 --> 03:03:51.300]  It looks like many of these leftists who are very set in their ways, they don't care who the person is.
[03:03:51.360 --> 03:03:54.523]  They're gonna vote whoever is on the opposite end of Trump.
[03:03:54.563 --> 03:03:55.424]  They don't care?
[03:03:55.464 --> 03:03:56.845]  You mean they do what they're told?
[03:03:58.320 --> 03:04:02.423]  Yeah, they're just so anti-Trump that to them it doesn't matter.
[03:04:02.543 --> 03:04:07.426]  They're like, oh, well, I'll vote for any of the contenders as long as it's not Trump.
[03:04:07.466 --> 03:04:09.747]  They don't care that Joe Biden's groping women.
[03:04:09.767 --> 03:04:10.968]  They don't care about his race.
[03:04:10.988 --> 03:04:16.531]  Can you imagine if I was in videos, like, walking up to people I don't know and, like, grabbing their kid's hair and smelling it?
[03:04:17.112 --> 03:04:18.773]  I mean, if somebody did that to my kid, I'd punch them!
[03:04:20.710 --> 03:04:21.831]  And they tried to justify that.
[03:04:21.871 --> 03:04:22.452]  Here's an example.
[03:04:22.492 --> 03:04:25.514]  You've been on my boat with my wife and now you and your husband and your son.
[03:04:25.915 --> 03:04:30.619]  Can you imagine if I was on a boat with you and I walked over and you were like rubbing your son's hair and smelling him?
[03:04:31.119 --> 03:04:32.681]  Wouldn't you kick me in the face or something?
[03:04:33.041 --> 03:04:35.143]  I mean, how does he get away with this?
[03:04:36.610 --> 03:04:37.130]  I don't know.
[03:04:37.510 --> 03:04:43.692]  See, that's what I... The left is willing to just idolize him and turn the cheek and just say, oh, that's all fine.
[03:04:43.712 --> 03:04:46.192]  But, you know, Brett Kavanaugh, he drinks beer.
[03:04:46.312 --> 03:04:47.772]  You are a racist!
[03:04:48.573 --> 03:04:49.113]  Shut up!
[03:04:49.753 --> 03:04:51.253]  Women need to keep their mouths shut.
[03:04:51.453 --> 03:04:52.273]  I'm Bernie Sanders.
[03:04:52.634 --> 03:04:58.035]  Let's come back and get to your report from Ohio with Joe Biden.
[03:04:58.595 --> 03:05:00.455]  Stay with us, everyone.
[03:05:00.915 --> 03:05:01.896]  I'm Bernie Sanders.
[03:05:04.884 --> 03:05:11.628]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[03:05:11.648 --> 03:05:14.810]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[03:05:15.331 --> 03:05:16.251]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[03:05:16.932 --> 03:05:19.113]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[03:05:19.633 --> 03:05:20.594]  You're our only sponsors.
[03:05:21.114 --> 03:05:27.138]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[03:05:27.599 --> 03:05:29.500]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[03:05:30.080 --> 03:05:30.781]  I'm not the leader.
[03:05:31.081 --> 03:05:31.682]  You are the leader.
[03:05:31.902 --> 03:05:33.483]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[03:05:33.863 --> 03:05:38.608]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.
[03:05:39.268 --> 03:05:46.715]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[03:05:46.755 --> 03:05:48.056]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[03:05:48.436 --> 03:05:54.502]  I want to encourage you again, go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[03:05:54.742 --> 03:05:57.524]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[03:05:57.905 --> 03:05:59.806]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[03:06:00.026 --> 03:06:00.807]  God bless you.
[03:06:06.412 --> 03:06:12.658]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:19.594 --> 03:06:25.416]  We're here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Joe Biden is holding his first campaign rally.
[03:06:25.717 --> 03:06:37.021]  It is my honor and pleasure to introduce Vice President Joe Biden, the next president of the United States of America!
[03:06:37.181 --> 03:06:40.082]  Practically the smallest amount of people I've ever seen here.
[03:06:40.683 --> 03:06:46.025]  It's not a big crowd size as compared to many Trump rallies that we've seen.
[03:06:46.805 --> 03:06:51.109]  This is typical of Democrat candidates, so they don't tend to have as big of turnout.
[03:06:51.129 --> 03:06:52.991]  This is not a really big venue either.
[03:06:53.011 --> 03:06:55.733]  It's a rather small building behind me that was filled up.
[03:06:56.294 --> 03:07:01.658]  But overall, it's interesting because I talked to... Alright, hit pause, hit pause, hit pause.
[03:07:01.678 --> 03:07:05.762]  If you're a radio listener, I know Millie said that it's capacity 240.
[03:07:06.122 --> 03:07:07.383]  She shows the fire department.
[03:07:07.864 --> 03:07:13.349]  But my god, this is like a 1920s tiny three-story building.
[03:07:14.764 --> 03:07:17.785]  They must have had them packed in like sardines just to make it look big.
[03:07:18.265 --> 03:07:20.705]  We're going to continue with the report, but this is pathetic.
[03:07:20.725 --> 03:07:22.425]  If you're a TV viewer, you see it.
[03:07:22.906 --> 03:07:27.947]  Radio listeners must go to Infowars.com, where we posted her article.
[03:07:27.967 --> 03:07:29.027]  I hope we posted it.
[03:07:29.067 --> 03:07:31.167]  I don't have the site pulled up.
[03:07:31.387 --> 03:07:33.748]  Dems shrug off Biden's racist past.
[03:07:33.788 --> 03:07:38.029]  I think the angle is media covers up for Trump having less than 200 people.
[03:07:38.469 --> 03:07:39.689]  This is pathetic.
[03:07:39.729 --> 03:07:40.269]  Let's continue.
[03:07:41.855 --> 03:07:46.256]  Uh, this is typical of Democrat candidates, though they don't tend to have as big of a turnout.
[03:07:46.276 --> 03:07:48.117]  This is not a really big venue either.
[03:07:48.137 --> 03:07:50.858]  It's a rather small building behind me that was filled up.
[03:07:51.438 --> 03:07:54.339]  But overall, it's interesting because I talked to... Pause again.
[03:07:55.159 --> 03:07:55.979]  Back it up to the start.
[03:07:56.299 --> 03:07:57.460]  This... 10 seconds.
[03:07:57.740 --> 03:07:59.620]  This is the Teamster Temple?
[03:08:00.261 --> 03:08:04.342]  And it was the Teamsters that signed deals for NAFTA and Gant?
[03:08:05.062 --> 03:08:07.383]  Uh, Mel, we're gonna go back to your report, but this is bombshell.
[03:08:08.143 --> 03:08:09.543]  That is a tiny building.
[03:08:09.583 --> 03:08:11.284]  He looked like a teepee at a meeting.
[03:08:12.865 --> 03:08:17.206]  Yeah, you know, when I pull up to many of these Democrat events, I'm like, what is going on?
[03:08:17.226 --> 03:08:21.107]  Could they have picked a smaller venue to hold their rally?
[03:08:21.347 --> 03:08:28.029]  At Trump events, it's like Superdome stadiums and 10,000, 20,000 turn back and helicopters and giant traffic for 20 miles.
[03:08:28.789 --> 03:08:31.630]  But with this, like, oh, look at the giant crowd.
[03:08:32.210 --> 03:08:36.291]  By the way, Bernie Sanders said you're a whitest supremacist story.
[03:08:36.311 --> 03:08:36.651]  Go ahead.
[03:08:38.112 --> 03:08:44.498]  Yeah, Joe Biden even held one of his recent ones in a tiny little bar in the middle of nowhere, pretty much.
[03:08:44.859 --> 03:08:51.626]  I mean, these guys are picking the smallest venues to make everyone crunch in there like sardines, so that then they could say, yeah, we had overflow.
[03:08:51.946 --> 03:08:56.390]  Well, you wouldn't have even had overflow if you didn't pick the highest- We had overflow in this phone booth!
[03:08:57.151 --> 03:08:58.192]  We're going to win!
[03:08:58.212 --> 03:09:01.836]  So we just need reporters at every event to shell their meeting in phone booths.
[03:09:03.089 --> 03:09:08.732]  And what's crazy is one of the vendors came up to me and was like, man, you know, the numbers are just not adding up.
[03:09:09.113 --> 03:09:11.454]  Like, we've been to all of them.
[03:09:11.514 --> 03:09:14.916]  Trump, Hillary, even in California they said Hillary had low turnout.
[03:09:15.096 --> 03:09:17.157]  Are you saying polls are fake?
[03:09:17.177 --> 03:09:21.500]  Are you saying Biden is not in the lead?
[03:09:23.613 --> 03:09:28.956]  I would say, you know, between Biden, Beto, all of them, I mean, they all had small turnouts.
[03:09:29.036 --> 03:09:30.117]  It's really hard to tell.
[03:09:30.137 --> 03:09:31.538]  You know what the best part about Beto is?
[03:09:31.598 --> 03:09:35.420]  He'll say something, and then two seconds later, do it like, I'll tell you I'm angry!
[03:09:36.561 --> 03:09:37.542]  Now you're in trouble!
[03:09:38.422 --> 03:09:39.783]  Is he a robot or something?
[03:09:40.664 --> 03:09:41.724]  Does he even talk like Bernie?
[03:09:41.744 --> 03:09:43.605]  Like, and everything's free!
[03:09:44.146 --> 03:09:44.806]  School!
[03:09:46.747 --> 03:09:47.348]  Healthcare!
[03:09:49.449 --> 03:09:50.530]  And free wages!
[03:09:51.010 --> 03:09:52.531]  And other good stuff, too!
[03:09:53.391 --> 03:09:54.532]  My name's Pedo!
[03:09:54.612 --> 03:09:56.193]  Sorry, Millie, I'm being bad today.
[03:09:56.233 --> 03:10:01.596]  I just... What a freak show that we can barely defeat this army of retards?
[03:10:03.638 --> 03:10:05.299]  It's because they're rigging the elections.
[03:10:05.339 --> 03:10:08.601]  There's literally no other way that Hillary can... Oh, that's it.
[03:10:08.721 --> 03:10:10.662]  Once a city goes blue, it never goes back.
[03:10:11.102 --> 03:10:11.582]  It's proven.
[03:10:11.663 --> 03:10:12.863]  Once it goes blue, it never goes back.
[03:10:12.883 --> 03:10:13.163]  Sorry.
[03:10:13.584 --> 03:10:18.767]  And then it's another weird, neurotic, inbred billionaire pissing on us like Pedo.
[03:10:19.929 --> 03:10:21.410]  So this is a CNN headline.
[03:10:21.811 --> 03:10:25.774]  Joe Biden's past 24 hours could not have gone more perfectly.
[03:10:26.074 --> 03:10:28.356]  His launch of his campaign is so successful.
[03:10:28.977 --> 03:10:29.737]  He's going to win.
[03:10:29.817 --> 03:10:30.978]  He's going to take on Trump.
[03:10:31.178 --> 03:10:33.220]  I mean, they're literally pushing and pumping him up.
[03:10:33.440 --> 03:10:46.972]  And if you actually went to the Joe Biden rally, which I did, sorry, but maybe 300 people showing up doesn't actually stand a real chance against President Trump when I've been to rallies in that exact same neighborhood of Trump's.
[03:10:47.392 --> 03:10:47.993]  And he had
[03:10:48.693 --> 03:10:51.994]  The most insane crowd sizes, lines, and miles.
[03:10:52.034 --> 03:10:52.914]  No, I totally agree.
[03:10:52.954 --> 03:10:53.854]  You've documented it all.
[03:10:54.575 --> 03:10:57.976]  What are they going to do when it comes out that he's a Chinese agent and got $3 billion from him?
[03:10:58.296 --> 03:10:59.116]  I mean, it's coming out.
[03:10:59.176 --> 03:11:00.696]  I mean, this guy is a criminal.
[03:11:01.217 --> 03:11:02.157]  Hardcore criminal.
[03:11:02.177 --> 03:11:03.457]  He thought he'd be protected by Hillary.
[03:11:03.857 --> 03:11:04.758]  He's gone so far.
[03:11:04.858 --> 03:11:05.838]  Why don't we let him walk?
[03:11:06.578 --> 03:11:08.078]  I want to see him in a Supermax present.
[03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:13.222]  We want to see Hillary in one, too.
[03:11:13.302 --> 03:11:16.765]  I mean, these Democrats seem to be able to commit crimes and do whatever they want.
[03:11:16.825 --> 03:11:17.886]  It's going to be you, Christian!
[03:11:18.307 --> 03:11:20.248]  It's going to be you in a gulag!
[03:11:20.929 --> 03:11:21.910]  Shut your mouth!
[03:11:22.290 --> 03:11:23.552]  I am superior, Millie.
[03:11:24.933 --> 03:11:26.815]  What do you say to Bernie and others?
[03:11:27.215 --> 03:11:30.178]  What do you see in the campaign, little lady?
[03:11:31.519 --> 03:11:37.440]  Well, what I see from the liberals, which these are going to be the ones voting, so these are who, you know, we're kind of up against.
[03:11:37.880 --> 03:11:39.521]  These people do not care.
[03:11:39.821 --> 03:11:46.642]  They're Democrats, can be racist, can say horrible things, can sexually assault people, can be these horrible, vile people.
[03:11:47.002 --> 03:11:49.303]  They're going to support their person regardless.
[03:11:49.763 --> 03:11:56.144]  And then they're going to try to criticize the Republican for any little thing they do and act like they don't have double standards.
[03:11:56.444 --> 03:11:58.705]  And the reality is, is this is all about policy.
[03:11:59.085 --> 03:12:03.949]  Let them, you know, behind their lies and whatever they try to use their emotional guilt trips.
[03:12:04.230 --> 03:12:05.691]  This is all about policy.
[03:12:05.731 --> 03:12:08.633]  You are not in the Politburo, young lady.
[03:12:08.653 --> 03:12:11.296]  You do not set policy.
[03:12:11.856 --> 03:12:17.541]  Let's go to more of this upstart, Millie Weaver, daring to speak down to Biden.
[03:12:17.901 --> 03:12:19.683]  Here's more of her report.
[03:12:20.686 --> 03:12:24.967]  This is typical of Democrat candidates, though they don't tend to have as big of turnout.
[03:12:24.987 --> 03:12:26.828]  This is not a really big venue either.
[03:12:26.868 --> 03:12:29.409]  It's a rather small building behind me that was filled out.
[03:12:29.429 --> 03:12:30.349]  Remember, this is a white supremacist.
[03:12:30.389 --> 03:12:42.493]  But overall, it's interesting because I talked to some of the shirt guys who follow around the presidential campaigns, and what he said is that he's noticed that the Democrat campaigns have much smaller turnouts.
[03:12:48.346 --> 03:12:50.707]  That is racist to criticize Biden!
[03:12:51.027 --> 03:12:53.829]  So let's go talk to some of these Biden supporters.
[03:12:54.349 --> 03:12:55.910]  What do you think about Biden?
[03:12:56.430 --> 03:12:56.770]  Biden?
[03:12:56.890 --> 03:12:57.371]  Not a fan.
[03:12:57.691 --> 03:12:58.271]  Not a fan?
[03:12:58.371 --> 03:12:58.911]  Not a fan.
[03:12:59.412 --> 03:13:00.192]  Why are you here then?
[03:13:00.752 --> 03:13:02.833]  Um, I'm here just to see what he has to say.
[03:13:03.694 --> 03:13:04.934]  Anybody to beat Trump.
[03:13:05.134 --> 03:13:06.255]  Anybody to beat Trump.
[03:13:06.495 --> 03:13:07.576]  But I like Joe Biden.
[03:13:07.616 --> 03:13:14.099]  I think he's very intelligent, very sincere, I think he's mature, experienced, and I think he has what it takes to beat Trump.
[03:13:16.932 --> 03:13:18.093]  Very impressed with him.
[03:13:18.373 --> 03:13:19.334]  Very impressed.
[03:13:19.374 --> 03:13:20.295]  He said, I like Biden.
[03:13:20.856 --> 03:13:22.257]  So what brings you out here?
[03:13:22.938 --> 03:13:23.939]  What do you like Alex Jones?
[03:13:23.959 --> 03:13:24.599]  What do you work for him?
[03:13:24.619 --> 03:13:26.301]  How much does he pay you?
[03:13:26.421 --> 03:13:28.142]  What brings you out here?
[03:13:28.182 --> 03:13:28.923]  How much does he pay you?
[03:13:29.243 --> 03:13:29.864]  Pause again.
[03:13:30.284 --> 03:13:31.986]  How much does he pay you?
[03:13:32.546 --> 03:13:34.929]  You want me to talk?
[03:13:35.429 --> 03:13:36.410]  I will not talk.
[03:13:36.830 --> 03:13:38.492]  How much does he pay you?
[03:13:38.972 --> 03:13:40.294]  Let's go back to this.
[03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:44.653]  Well, Alex, that's one of the things that it's hard to hear in there.
[03:13:44.693 --> 03:13:46.594]  He actually says, how much does he pay you?
[03:13:46.674 --> 03:13:47.755]  Are you sleeping with him?
[03:13:48.356 --> 03:13:54.841]  So he can say this sexist remark to me and sit there and act like he's an ally to feminists.
[03:13:54.901 --> 03:13:57.483]  Oh, by the way, by the way, Millie, we've shaken hands.
[03:13:57.483 --> 03:13:58.203]  How dare him?
[03:14:20.051 --> 03:14:27.853]  No, what it is, is we all know that's the case, Alex, of course, but this guy is going to essentially... No, he's gonna say you're a sex object.
[03:14:28.113 --> 03:14:35.195]  He's gonna say you're not out there because you're a badass reporter who has incredible courage, who's been beat up and pepper-sprayed and called a white supremacist and attacked.
[03:14:35.395 --> 03:14:41.617]  He's gonna say you got a job here, not because you get 20 million views a month, not because you're badass, but because you're a woman!
[03:14:42.679 --> 03:14:46.081]  Like as though that's the only reason why a woman would be a reporter, right?
[03:14:46.121 --> 03:14:48.603]  That's the only reason a woman would actually be out there.
[03:14:48.663 --> 03:14:50.704]  Not because she can hold her own as a reporter.
[03:14:50.724 --> 03:14:52.405]  And only a leftist would think like that.
[03:14:52.765 --> 03:14:53.826]  I mean, I can't... Exactly.
[03:14:55.442 --> 03:14:55.982]  Exactly.
[03:14:56.602 --> 03:15:07.706]  Yet, Trump has put more women in his cabinet than any other president, and these guys are the ones who want to say, oh, Trump's a misogynist, he's sexist, all this stuff, but then this guy can say sexist stuff to me.
[03:15:07.726 --> 03:15:09.487]  Tom Pafford's coming up in 15 minutes.
[03:15:09.547 --> 03:15:10.167]  God bless him.
[03:15:10.207 --> 03:15:11.127]  I seem to take over time.
[03:15:11.167 --> 03:15:12.207]  He's going to host, but I love him.
[03:15:12.468 --> 03:15:16.249]  We'll get him his own show soon, as well as you, but you're too busy on the road to your own show.
[03:15:16.269 --> 03:15:16.989]  We'd already launched one.
[03:15:17.329 --> 03:15:22.531]  I want to come back and have you have the floor and play more of the clips to get into this, but yeah, these weird men,
[03:15:23.433 --> 03:15:25.835]  Going, oh, why are you with Infowars?
[03:15:25.895 --> 03:15:27.376]  Are you having sex with Jones?
[03:15:27.456 --> 03:15:30.398]  I mean, I remember the media put P.I.s on us.
[03:15:30.778 --> 03:15:32.919]  I've never told this story a few years ago, but I think I'm going to tell it.
[03:15:33.219 --> 03:15:34.460]  Leanne's coming into town this week.
[03:15:34.500 --> 03:15:35.661]  Her grandma had brain cancer.
[03:15:35.681 --> 03:15:36.461]  That's why she left for a while.
[03:15:36.481 --> 03:15:39.663]  But they had P.I.s on us and were convinced me and Leanne were dating.
[03:15:39.924 --> 03:15:40.464]  Never happened.
[03:15:40.824 --> 03:15:41.905]  I've shook Leanne's hand.
[03:15:42.405 --> 03:15:47.909]  They're, like, convinced I'm like them, that if good-looking women work in the building, I'm having sex with them.
[03:15:48.409 --> 03:15:49.250]  It ain't happening.
[03:15:50.233 --> 03:15:53.115]  What's happening is I'm F-ing over your globalist agenda.
[03:15:53.455 --> 03:15:53.915]  Got that?
[03:15:54.756 --> 03:15:56.477]  God Almighty, it's insane.
[03:15:57.497 --> 03:15:58.538]  Holy Toledo!
[03:15:58.578 --> 03:15:59.259]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:59.279 --> 03:15:59.659]  Stay with us.
[03:16:05.602 --> 03:16:12.347]  David Nino Rodriguez!
[03:16:12.647 --> 03:16:14.368]  David Nino Rodriguez dot com.
[03:16:14.548 --> 03:16:19.211]  I'm familiar with his boxing career, though I'm not a big sports guy that has time to follow boxing.
[03:16:20.322 --> 03:16:27.589]  I do follow some of the heavyweight stuff, and I've also seen him on some national TV defending Trump, as some UFC fighters have done and gotten a lot of criticism.
[03:16:28.089 --> 03:16:44.425]  But he is uniquely able to speak about this because he grew up in El Paso and saw the devastation on the border, and he's seen firsthand the abhorrent violence of gangs, sex, drug, and organ trafficking, and the alarming volume of criminal behavior committed by illegals on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border.
[03:16:44.485 --> 03:16:45.186]  Let's get into it!
[03:16:45.606 --> 03:16:49.691]  You live down there, and Trump says, really dangerous on one side, a lot safer on the other.
[03:16:50.011 --> 03:16:55.337]  He says walls make people safer, and the left says, oh no, there's nothing happening, Mexico's a wonderful place, there's no crime.
[03:16:55.417 --> 03:17:00.143]  The big thing before the wall, I just want to clear this up, the big thing before the wall, the reason I know the wall worked,
[03:17:00.683 --> 03:17:01.264]  We're good to go!
[03:17:21.802 --> 03:17:37.025]  And they'd run right over there and put rocks in the street or 2x4s with nails and when a car would come it would hit the 2x4 with nails and it would come to a complete stop or it would hit the boulders and stop and then they would run out and carjack the people, take everything they had and sometimes even murder the people.
[03:17:37.165 --> 03:17:39.525]  So that was just the lower element of crime.
[03:17:39.705 --> 03:17:44.166]  Or they would go and hijack or go steal from the containers of the Santa Fe train.
[03:17:44.306 --> 03:17:48.147]  Which they took so much merchandise off that train and then they'd go sell it in Mexico.
[03:17:48.447 --> 03:17:49.547]  So they would call that a hit.
[03:17:49.927 --> 03:17:53.369]  So they would go there and take a hit off the train, take a hit off someone driving their car.
[03:17:53.710 --> 03:17:55.671]  And this was easy to do.
[03:17:55.691 --> 03:17:57.032]  This is what they did every weekend.
[03:17:57.852 --> 03:17:59.353]  Every day, really, if they wanted to.
[03:17:59.373 --> 03:18:00.934]  It was just an ongoing thing.
[03:18:01.074 --> 03:18:03.776]  And that was just a lower element of criminal activity.
[03:18:03.896 --> 03:18:09.780]  The higher criminal activity was when, 2006, when George Bush started building the wall and finished it during the Obama administration.
[03:18:09.800 --> 03:18:12.502]  Boy, did we see the cartels take over that city.
[03:18:12.582 --> 03:18:16.545]  I mean, the extortion and the killings of 50 to 100 people a day.
[03:18:16.625 --> 03:18:17.425]  It was like a war zone.
[03:18:17.445 --> 03:18:18.526]  It was like Iraq over there.
[03:18:18.967 --> 03:18:21.302]  And El Paso became, you know, coincidentally...
[03:18:22.006 --> 03:18:26.487]  The safest city, while Juarez became the number one murder capital of the world.
[03:18:26.627 --> 03:18:32.968]  And to see Beto O'Rourke, who's from my hometown, sell out to this idea, which he knows damn well that that wall has helped.
[03:18:33.148 --> 03:18:36.229]  I have a lot of friends that are Border Patrol agents in this area.
[03:18:36.569 --> 03:18:42.491]  And, you know, as you know, the checkpoints are all closed down because they're dealing with such an influx of immigrants coming here.
[03:18:42.631 --> 03:18:45.131]  And these aren't people that are just from Mexico.
[03:18:45.171 --> 03:18:48.452]  This is, you know, as you know as well, you say it all the time, South America, Africa,
[03:18:50.113 --> 03:18:54.076]  They're all here, and they're getting 1,800 to 2,000 people a day.
[03:18:54.136 --> 03:18:55.277]  That's how serious this is.
[03:18:55.797 --> 03:19:00.961]  I mean, we're being bombarded right now here at the border, and they're having to let these people go into general population.
[03:19:00.982 --> 03:19:07.807]  They're letting anywhere from 200 to 500 people a day, from what I understand the numbers, they're just letting them go into general population.
[03:19:08.007 --> 03:19:11.389]  And these people, these aren't just people with kids and, you know, families.
[03:19:11.409 --> 03:19:15.131]  These are grown men that we don't know what their objective is to come here.
[03:19:15.151 --> 03:19:15.532]  We don't know.
[03:19:15.552 --> 03:19:17.893]  I mean, a lot of these people grew up in crime in the community.
[03:19:17.913 --> 03:19:21.875]  You gotta understand, like, Juarez, these third world countries, these people grow up with crime.
[03:19:22.115 --> 03:19:27.078]  So do you think they're coming here to America to sack groceries and to work at Albertsons or something like that?
[03:19:27.118 --> 03:19:28.079]  These people are coming here.
[03:19:28.379 --> 03:19:29.080]  They know one thing.
[03:19:29.120 --> 03:19:30.300]  They know how to make quick hits.
[03:19:30.420 --> 03:19:31.161]  I know these people.
[03:19:31.441 --> 03:19:36.664]  They know how to make a quick hit, do a drug deal, rob a house, do whatever, and have money to live on for a couple weeks.
[03:19:37.104 --> 03:19:38.084]  That's what's coming over here.
[03:19:38.124 --> 03:19:42.165]  So these Democrats saying all this stuff about it's it's inhumane and unfair.
[03:19:42.205 --> 03:19:56.669]  The only thing that's inhumane is the is the sex trafficking and you know the people crossing here that have to go for ranges of miles and miles and miles without any food or water and being you know the women being assaulted the kids being used for like I said sex trafficking.
[03:19:56.689 --> 03:19:57.569]  That's what's inhumane.
[03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:58.970]  The wall will stop all that.
[03:20:06.190 --> 03:20:08.787]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.862 --> 03:20:22.183]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[03:20:22.303 --> 03:20:25.266]  Tom Papert, our great local TV station manager, is taking over.
[03:20:25.286 --> 03:20:28.129]  So I want to work out getting his own show soon here on the network.
[03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:29.851]  So I appreciate him holding while we do all this.
[03:20:30.712 --> 03:20:32.093]  Millie Weaver, yeah, you're up there.
[03:20:32.113 --> 03:20:34.355]  And again, this all got filed today while it was on air.
[03:20:34.415 --> 03:20:36.057]  You sent me a transcript of some of what was in it.
[03:20:37.742 --> 03:20:41.383]  But you've got leftists coming up to you going, honey, why are you on InfoWars?
[03:20:41.423 --> 03:20:42.944]  You having sex with Alex Jones?
[03:20:43.644 --> 03:20:46.745]  And imagine, like, if a right-winger said that, as if we would ever do it.
[03:20:46.805 --> 03:20:52.167]  You're good-looking, you're smart, you've got hundreds of millions of views on these platforms conservatively.
[03:20:52.327 --> 03:20:53.408]  It's got to be a billion now.
[03:20:54.328 --> 03:20:58.410]  You've been on air as a reporter for InfoWars off and on for like seven years.
[03:20:58.910 --> 03:20:59.750]  You're married.
[03:21:00.210 --> 03:21:01.711]  Your husband's running camera.
[03:21:01.751 --> 03:21:03.492]  You just had a baby a few months ago.
[03:21:04.540 --> 03:21:11.265]  And it's like, I'm not going to slap that guy in the face, but man, he won't respond to a live TV.
[03:21:11.765 --> 03:21:13.086]  He won't respond to a camera.
[03:21:13.687 --> 03:21:20.091]  He just wants to dehumanize you and do something that no right winger would ever do, but that he claims right wingers are doing.
[03:21:20.131 --> 03:21:20.932]  It was disgusting.
[03:21:22.210 --> 03:21:27.833]  Oh yeah, it was just a way to try to degrade me or try to, you know, dehumanize.
[03:21:27.893 --> 03:21:31.635]  Like you said, degrade me, make me look like I'm not worth my salt.
[03:21:32.215 --> 03:21:37.979]  Many of the women standing by actually were not thrilled by him talking that way to a female reporter.
[03:21:38.579 --> 03:21:41.420]  So even some of the other women... We're going to play it again.
[03:21:41.440 --> 03:21:42.561]  We're going to play it again.
[03:21:42.641 --> 03:21:45.683]  But I mean, and I just jump in here not to dominate you because I have to keep making comments.
[03:21:47.921 --> 03:21:52.044]  I noticed people got upset by that, but I mean, this is the standard leftist operation.
[03:21:52.124 --> 03:21:53.405]  Why do you think they act like this?
[03:21:55.107 --> 03:21:57.328]  Well, I think they're just hypocrites, really.
[03:21:57.709 --> 03:22:01.371]  Double standards, hypocrisy run rampant within the left.
[03:22:01.972 --> 03:22:06.515]  And they can be vile and nasty and mean, and they don't care.
[03:22:06.575 --> 03:22:11.139]  They see that they do no wrong because they believe that they have the moral high ground
[03:22:11.619 --> 03:22:15.421]  Because they adhere to these principles that are being perpetuated through propaganda.
[03:22:15.441 --> 03:22:17.762]  Well, you were a contractor seven years ago for us.
[03:22:18.162 --> 03:22:19.322]  You've been here for three years.
[03:22:19.882 --> 03:22:22.904]  You just, like, royal flush, just like Caitlin Bennett.
[03:22:22.924 --> 03:22:26.985]  I mean, it isn't about women or men, but I'm actually telling my crew, I'm like, we need women.
[03:22:27.806 --> 03:22:29.086]  It's women that are dominating.
[03:22:29.126 --> 03:22:30.227]  And not just because you're a woman.
[03:22:30.267 --> 03:22:33.688]  The stuff you say, the stuff you do, what you catch, it's that magic.
[03:22:34.528 --> 03:22:37.730]  And we're trying to hire women versus CNN that's almost all men.
[03:22:37.750 --> 03:22:39.631]  It just seems like a virtue signal.
[03:22:39.671 --> 03:22:40.611]  It seems like pure crap.
[03:22:41.658 --> 03:22:43.799]  Look, you know, I don't take it personal.
[03:22:43.819 --> 03:22:46.901]  A lot of this slides off my back like water off a duck's back.
[03:22:47.001 --> 03:22:52.223]  I mean, I don't care because I know most of these people are crazy, okay?
[03:22:52.263 --> 03:22:54.224]  So who cares what a crazy person says?
[03:22:54.525 --> 03:22:56.906]  I mean, they were calling you all kinds of things, Alex.
[03:22:56.946 --> 03:22:58.567]  I mean, they were just making up stuff.
[03:22:58.587 --> 03:23:01.268]  Like, just one of them, you just said, I'm a pedophile.
[03:23:01.308 --> 03:23:03.809]  Well, just imagine that I hire women to have sex.
[03:23:03.869 --> 03:23:06.871]  Imagine that I'm actually hiring women to have sex with them.
[03:23:07.311 --> 03:23:08.772]  Think of how insulting that is.
[03:23:10.327 --> 03:23:10.867]  Well, yeah.
[03:23:11.087 --> 03:23:15.030]  It was really meant to insult me as a reporter out there.
[03:23:15.110 --> 03:23:16.370]  That's what his aim was.
[03:23:16.650 --> 03:23:18.351]  I don't think they even believe half the stuff they say.
[03:23:18.371 --> 03:23:23.934]  Well, let's just say it, Millie, because you've got a great husband and two children, and I'm sure that's passion and it's awesome, but let's be honest.
[03:23:24.414 --> 03:23:30.858]  When you get a video that gets 20 million views and you change the course of humanity and you stand up for your children, is that not the highest thrill in your life?
[03:23:32.145 --> 03:23:36.729]  Well, you know, Caitlyn Bennett was actually the one who just recently got the 20 million view video.
[03:23:36.749 --> 03:23:37.570]  I think she got like 50 million.
[03:23:38.291 --> 03:23:40.433]  Oh, she just is off the charts.
[03:23:40.613 --> 03:23:41.794]  She is really kicking butt.
[03:23:41.814 --> 03:23:44.157]  And I'm just saying, explain to people what really matters.
[03:23:44.437 --> 03:23:45.158]  We didn't script this.
[03:23:45.178 --> 03:23:46.739]  I mean, just what's your view on that?
[03:23:48.181 --> 03:23:55.107]  Well, I mean, my view is that you're always going to have people who are haters or who love what you're doing when you're actually being
[03:23:56.796 --> 03:23:57.496]  How would I say?
[03:23:57.556 --> 03:24:00.377]  When you're actually going out there and doing something that's worth doing.
[03:24:00.397 --> 03:24:02.458]  You're going to have people that hate you or love you.
[03:24:02.478 --> 03:24:05.339]  Sure, so what I'm saying is, what are the highest points in your life?
[03:24:07.240 --> 03:24:10.981]  Probably following around the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Trump campaign.
[03:24:11.021 --> 03:24:12.342]  And catching her falling down.
[03:24:13.662 --> 03:24:14.463]  Well, that too.
[03:24:14.483 --> 03:24:16.644]  It's not like it's the highest point in my life.
[03:24:16.744 --> 03:24:19.525]  Obviously the highest point emotionally in my life is having my son.
[03:24:19.545 --> 03:24:21.986]  No, but that's like shooting torpedoes down the Death Star mineshaft.
[03:24:22.426 --> 03:24:22.846]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:24:23.923 --> 03:24:26.325]  The highest point in my life was actually having my son.
[03:24:26.545 --> 03:24:33.209]  I mean, that's my moment of like, wow, I like, I just, you know, I fulfilled my my dreams, my hopes.
[03:24:33.310 --> 03:24:35.111]  And, you know, that's the highest point in my life.
[03:24:35.471 --> 03:24:44.477]  But as far as like my career, I would say following the Trump campaign, the Hillary campaign, participating in what happened in 2016, that was just so amazing.
[03:24:44.517 --> 03:24:48.600]  And I hope more people will actually get out there and participate in this next upcoming election.
[03:24:48.620 --> 03:24:49.180]  Exactly.
[03:24:49.200 --> 03:24:52.543]  They want to penalize people, but they can't stop the masses.
[03:24:53.407 --> 03:24:55.008]  But you just had your new baby, too.
[03:24:55.048 --> 03:24:55.689]  That was powerful.
[03:24:55.729 --> 03:24:57.791]  But there's nothing like that first baby, is there?
[03:24:59.011 --> 03:25:01.193]  It's that first baby.
[03:25:01.774 --> 03:25:03.255]  I love my daughter all the same.
[03:25:03.355 --> 03:25:04.416]  I love her just as much.
[03:25:04.456 --> 03:25:07.198]  But just like the rite of passage into motherhood.
[03:25:07.278 --> 03:25:09.100]  Explain the switches that get flipped.
[03:25:09.400 --> 03:25:11.882]  How much does your IQ go up when you had that first baby?
[03:25:13.543 --> 03:25:16.225]  I don't even know if it's necessarily IQ.
[03:25:16.345 --> 03:25:21.970]  It's that my confidence, my strength, my authority,
[03:25:23.349 --> 03:25:31.183]  My compassion, my empathy, all of that just got heightened to where I'm like, it sounds cheesy, but I'm this mother bear, so don't mess with my kids, you know?
[03:25:31.223 --> 03:25:32.765]  It's like, do not mess with me.
[03:25:32.785 --> 03:25:34.689]  You turned into a war machine for humanity.
[03:25:35.976 --> 03:25:41.121]  Yeah, and I try to project that out there in my work and stand with strength.
[03:25:41.201 --> 03:25:50.328]  And I'm not intimidated by these crazy leftists that want to scream and yell in my face and threaten me, because I know that what I'm doing is right.
[03:25:50.369 --> 03:25:58.816]  And I'm a person of faith where I believe that God protects me and looks out for me, because I feel like what I'm doing is, in a way, some of his work.
[03:25:59.096 --> 03:26:00.216]  No, I totally agree.
[03:26:00.336 --> 03:26:01.276]  The force is with you.
[03:26:01.356 --> 03:26:04.257]  Let's go back to your huge reports on Infowars.com.
[03:26:05.237 --> 03:26:07.438]  We should get to all of it here, but Papert's coming up.
[03:26:07.818 --> 03:26:11.059]  Here's more of this guy saying, oh, you're on Infowars because you have sex with Alex Jones.
[03:26:11.099 --> 03:26:11.439]  Here he is.
[03:26:12.219 --> 03:26:13.159]  Who said I liked Biden?
[03:26:13.759 --> 03:26:15.139]  So what brings you out here?
[03:26:15.820 --> 03:26:16.820]  What do you like Alex Jones?
[03:26:16.840 --> 03:26:17.480]  What do you work for him?
[03:26:18.420 --> 03:26:20.400]  So what brings you out here?
[03:26:20.941 --> 03:26:21.781]  How much does he pay you?
[03:26:21.941 --> 03:26:22.661]  Are you sleeping with him?
[03:26:24.187 --> 03:26:34.331]  That's a pretty, I would say sexist comment to make against a female reporter, that I have to be sleeping with my boss in order to have a job.
[03:26:34.391 --> 03:26:35.672]  That's pretty low.
[03:26:36.112 --> 03:26:36.832]  That's pretty low.
[03:26:37.173 --> 03:26:38.133]  Do you like Biden?
[03:26:38.893 --> 03:26:41.855]  I'm looking at the field and doing my homework.
[03:26:42.275 --> 03:26:43.915]  What do you hope to hear from Biden today?
[03:26:43.935 --> 03:26:46.016]  A plan for our future.
[03:26:46.577 --> 03:26:47.957]  What do you think about Donald Trump?
[03:26:47.997 --> 03:26:49.698]  What am I on?
[03:26:53.229 --> 03:26:54.090]  Not very much.
[03:26:54.110 --> 03:26:58.154]  I think he's a piece of work.
[03:26:58.855 --> 03:26:59.896]  He wants to build the wall.
[03:27:01.358 --> 03:27:03.240]  He is anti-immigration.
[03:27:03.260 --> 03:27:08.985]  He has produced tax cuts for the wealthy.
[03:27:09.005 --> 03:27:11.088]  Let's hit pause again.
[03:27:11.768 --> 03:27:13.910]  Wall Street gives 99% of their money to Hillary.
[03:27:14.875 --> 03:27:17.857]  They're trying to crush our border and enslave us right now.
[03:27:18.357 --> 03:27:20.378]  And these people are just such followers.
[03:27:20.418 --> 03:27:22.079]  And I'm not being mean, but you look at them.
[03:27:22.379 --> 03:27:24.501]  They're so physically weak, Mellie.
[03:27:25.081 --> 03:27:26.502]  Like, a woman has great intuition.
[03:27:27.042 --> 03:27:29.544]  About a man, or about a... Women have intuition.
[03:27:29.864 --> 03:27:31.905]  What is your intuition about leftists when you're around them?
[03:27:32.325 --> 03:27:33.766]  I don't feel good they're so weak.
[03:27:33.846 --> 03:27:34.967]  I just feel like they're dead.
[03:27:36.673 --> 03:27:38.054]  Yeah, they're definitely lost.
[03:27:38.715 --> 03:27:43.218]  I mean, misinformed, lost, aimed in the wrong direction.
[03:27:43.759 --> 03:27:53.346]  It's like they're literally just brainwashed and it's like you can trigger them just by saying things that you know go against the mainstream media's programming, essentially.
[03:27:54.207 --> 03:28:01.713]  So it's crazy to see that these are like lemmings that all want to run off a cliff into the next Hillary, which is Biden.
[03:28:03.001 --> 03:28:04.382]  Wow, the next Venezuela.
[03:28:04.422 --> 03:28:06.222]  Well, tell people where they can find your videos.
[03:28:06.242 --> 03:28:08.583]  They're on newswars.com, they're on infowars.com.
[03:28:08.944 --> 03:28:11.245]  Only our audience can breathe life into these and get them out there.
[03:28:12.085 --> 03:28:16.347]  But tell people about your YouTube, about your Twitter, about where people can find the great work you're doing, Millie.
[03:28:17.372 --> 03:28:32.308]  Well, you can go to Millennial Millie on YouTube and what I will say is that that was just the very beginning of the videos and the other video is even more impactful where these leftists go crazy, they attack me, they slander Alex Jones, one lady threatens me.
[03:28:32.328 --> 03:28:33.449]  I haven't seen this yet.
[03:28:33.489 --> 03:28:34.270]  What's the name of that one?
[03:28:35.251 --> 03:28:38.495]  That one is called Uninformed Leftists Get Triggered by Facts.
[03:28:39.500 --> 03:28:40.701]  That was actually pretty funny.
[03:28:40.761 --> 03:28:41.822]  It's hilarious, actually.
[03:28:41.842 --> 03:28:44.325]  We're gonna have to bleep that out and air it on The War Room coming up.
[03:28:44.505 --> 03:28:45.606]  But we'll get it out.
[03:28:46.347 --> 03:28:47.348]  Alright, Millie, you're awesome.
[03:28:47.749 --> 03:28:48.870]  Gavin's awesome.
[03:28:48.910 --> 03:28:49.911]  He's the guy behind the camera.
[03:28:49.931 --> 03:28:50.431]  Your husband.
[03:28:50.952 --> 03:28:51.713]  You're awesome.
[03:28:51.753 --> 03:28:53.595]  We admire you as a human soul.
[03:28:54.035 --> 03:28:54.736]  And we love you.
[03:28:54.756 --> 03:28:58.620]  And all these idiots thinking that we're all having sex or something.
[03:28:58.660 --> 03:28:59.781]  It's a little bit deeper than that.
[03:28:59.821 --> 03:29:00.482]  It's spiritual.
[03:29:10.391 --> 03:29:11.672]  There's some Pharisee up here on a high horse.
[03:29:11.752 --> 03:29:13.614]  It's perfect, but I love God and I love Christ.
[03:29:14.534 --> 03:29:16.556]  And we're not tax-exempt because the government can't regulate us.
[03:29:17.116 --> 03:29:25.323]  But when you buy a book, you buy a video, you buy a t-shirt, you buy coffee every month, you buy toothpaste every month, you buy stuff like protein bars every month on AutoShip.
[03:29:25.343 --> 03:29:27.344]  You can do it every two months, every three months, every four months.
[03:29:27.364 --> 03:29:28.185]  Just click the button.
[03:29:28.265 --> 03:29:29.366]  Cancel for free anytime.
[03:29:29.866 --> 03:29:34.410]  You can tithe a little bit of profit we make on each one to fund this operation.
[03:29:35.720 --> 03:29:38.705]  Push us into the black, and help us stand in the face of the globalists.
[03:29:38.725 --> 03:29:42.090]  So please, a lot of the great losers have done this, and we salute them, we thank them.
[03:29:42.110 --> 03:29:46.917]  But if you haven't habituated, then go to infowarestore.com and get a t-shirt.

[03:29:57.330 --> 03:29:58.631]  Don't California my Texas.
[03:29:58.771 --> 03:29:59.292]  Baseball.
[03:29:59.432 --> 03:30:00.413]  New Jersey style.

[03:30:08.341 --> 03:30:09.081]  These are great deals at 300.

[03:30:09.922 --> 03:30:10.122]  $50 off.
[03:30:10.162 --> 03:30:12.345]  That helps fund our operation.
[03:30:14.827 --> 03:30:16.288]  And we have the best deal on food ever.
[03:30:16.428 --> 03:30:21.412]  It's in these high-quality plastic... I mean, hell, just a plastic container at Walmart would cost this much.
[03:30:21.432 --> 03:30:25.515]  It was nice, snap-top, plastic, high-quality, rubber-made type material.
[03:30:25.635 --> 03:30:30.459]  Then it's got a two-week food supply in a big soap container.
[03:30:30.479 --> 03:30:32.880]  1,500 calories a day, 92 servings.
[03:30:33.141 --> 03:30:36.723]  You can see that it's already got 97% positive reviews, 4.8%
[03:30:37.904 --> 03:30:40.987]  That is the best deal on high-quality, storable food out there.
[03:30:41.007 --> 03:30:45.172]  And it's great to have one in your garage, one in your car, one at work in case something goes down.
[03:30:45.192 --> 03:30:47.935]  Or you can give it to people for charity or give it to homeless down the road.
[03:30:47.955 --> 03:30:48.856]  It lasts 25 years.
[03:30:49.236 --> 03:30:50.297]  This is the best deal ever.
[03:30:50.437 --> 03:30:57.525]  You have a two-week supply, ladies and gentlemen, that is more than 50% off it is at cost.
[03:30:58.266 --> 03:31:00.508]  $67.
[03:30:59.367 --> 03:31:00.508]  That is at cost.
[03:31:00.708 --> 03:31:03.510]  As a promotional they're doing because they want you to see how great it is.
[03:31:03.550 --> 03:31:04.331]  It's a loss leader.
[03:31:04.471 --> 03:31:05.892]  Infowars Life Select.
[03:31:05.992 --> 03:31:07.474]  By that it's private label.
[03:31:07.494 --> 03:31:08.855]  My Patriot Supply will be good around.
[03:31:08.975 --> 03:31:11.157]  Contracts they have with the distributors go to the lowest.
[03:31:11.277 --> 03:31:12.919]  Us being a private labeler.
[03:31:13.059 --> 03:31:14.460]  It's a private label at the very same factory.
[03:31:14.500 --> 03:31:15.481]  Fresh, high-quality food.
[03:31:15.561 --> 03:31:16.262]  So it's all there.
[03:31:16.282 --> 03:31:16.262]  $67.
[03:31:16.682 --> 03:31:19.044]  Two-week food supply.
[03:31:19.144 --> 03:31:22.327]  Just the container itself, it'll cost close to that at Walmart.
[03:31:22.507 --> 03:31:22.988]  It's also highly
[03:31:23.148 --> 03:31:23.929]  Definitely reusable.
[03:31:24.009 --> 03:31:26.591]  Each meal is in its own vacuum-sealed packet.

[03:33:21.430 --> 03:33:23.271]  Silver Stallion.
[03:33:23.411 --> 03:33:33.253]  You know, few bands can do live better than they can do taped, but that is definitely the Highwayman.
[03:33:33.373 --> 03:33:37.174]  Only Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson survive.
[03:33:37.974 --> 03:33:38.355]  Teach him.
[03:33:45.649 --> 03:33:48.530]  He can trust me like a brother.
[03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:55.093]  And one day, one day we'll saddle up and ride.
[03:33:56.514 --> 03:33:58.115]  And we're gonna ride.
[03:33:59.695 --> 03:34:01.296]  And we're gonna ride.
[03:34:02.837 --> 03:34:06.979]  We're gonna ride.
[03:34:07.279 --> 03:34:11.861]  Ride like a one-eyed jack-of-diamonds... Can you use that cheesy...
[03:34:14.818 --> 03:34:22.803]  Game of Thrones analogy about those dragons that took five seasons to raise, but once you raise them, they're fire-breathing and they're ready.
[03:34:24.484 --> 03:34:28.447]  Best part of the song, I'm gonna find me a reckless woman.
[03:34:28.807 --> 03:34:31.068]  With razor blades and dice.
[03:34:38.766 --> 03:34:42.069]  And just a touch of sadness in her fingers.
[03:34:42.489 --> 03:34:43.030]  And thunder!
[03:34:43.050 --> 03:34:44.531]  Oh, we're gonna ride.
[03:34:44.631 --> 03:34:45.992]  We're gonna ride.
[03:34:47.954 --> 03:34:49.815]  Ride like the one-eyed Jack.
[03:35:05.787 --> 03:35:08.268]  This is America's defense against the globalist cancer.
[03:35:09.149 --> 03:35:09.929]  This is it.
[03:35:10.049 --> 03:35:11.891]  This is you, the audience, that are the leaders.
[03:35:12.771 --> 03:35:14.032]  You're in the arena right now.
[03:35:14.112 --> 03:35:15.073]  Tom Pappert takes over.
[03:35:15.093 --> 03:35:18.195]  I want to invite him to co-host the show soon, or take it over himself.
[03:35:18.555 --> 03:35:24.399]  Just bad luck for him every time he's about to co-host, and I appreciate him doing it, that I end up taking over, but there's so much going on.
[03:35:24.419 --> 03:35:25.620]  I want an epic time to be alive.
[03:35:26.040 --> 03:35:27.821]  Tom, we love you, and we appreciate you.
[03:35:27.841 --> 03:35:28.622]  Take it over, my friend.
[03:35:29.946 --> 03:35:30.686]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:35:30.706 --> 03:35:31.786]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[03:35:31.806 --> 03:35:33.007]  And it's okay, I understand.
[03:35:33.047 --> 03:35:35.847]  Sometimes the news is just so insane, you need to keep going.
[03:35:35.887 --> 03:35:45.849]  And someday, Alex, when we're all done with this, when you can finally retire like Bilbo Baggins, let's go create a Highwaymen cover band, because your country music singing is some of the best out there, I have to say.
[03:35:45.869 --> 03:35:46.529]  No, you're awesome.
[03:35:46.869 --> 03:35:55.851]  I didn't cover transgender athlete smashes four women's powerlifting records, and then world champion powerlifting women go, this is a joke, that's a man, they're calling for their arrest.
[03:35:56.491 --> 03:36:00.614]  I mean, this is the level we've hit where every women's sport is going to be dominated by a dude!
[03:36:00.634 --> 03:36:02.535]  I mean, this is mental illness, man!
[03:36:03.095 --> 03:36:04.436]  You don't like trans people!
[03:36:04.656 --> 03:36:06.337]  I don't give a damn what you're doing!
[03:36:06.557 --> 03:36:07.958]  You want to cut your Johnson off?
[03:36:07.998 --> 03:36:09.799]  Go ahead, just don't charge me for it!
[03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:17.904]  But I don't want to go to one of my daughter's sports and have some 40... You know how they have adults competing against little kids?
[03:36:18.244 --> 03:36:20.666]  They're now saying they identify themselves as young.
[03:36:21.046 --> 03:36:24.108]  So some 50-year-old dude is going to beat up your 5-year-old daughter!
[03:36:25.250 --> 03:36:26.170]  God Almighty!
[03:36:26.290 --> 03:36:26.690]  Jesus!
[03:36:26.830 --> 03:36:27.171]  Sorry.
[03:36:28.131 --> 03:36:28.711]  No, you're alright.
[03:36:28.751 --> 03:36:30.292]  You know, I've got a friend here in town.
[03:36:30.352 --> 03:36:31.852]  He's a big, muscular guy.
[03:36:31.912 --> 03:36:33.272]  He works out all summer long.
[03:36:33.653 --> 03:36:36.413]  And I keep telling him, Craig, you and I need to get together.
[03:36:36.653 --> 03:36:37.994]  You'll identify as a woman.
[03:36:38.034 --> 03:36:39.134]  You can even wear a dress.
[03:36:39.254 --> 03:36:44.336]  Oh, I think as a stunt, I should try to go join, say, six-year-old girls swimming.
[03:36:44.956 --> 03:36:45.676]  And I can beat them.
[03:36:46.296 --> 03:36:48.117]  And I'll just like, I'm a six-year-old girl.
[03:36:48.137 --> 03:36:51.238]  And I'll just, I'll be in the newspaper with all the blue ribbons.
[03:36:52.748 --> 03:36:53.770]  In fact, I'm doing it!
[03:36:53.850 --> 03:36:54.592]  That's it!
[03:36:54.792 --> 03:36:55.513]  I'm doing it!
[03:36:55.834 --> 03:36:57.156]  I am a six-year-old girl!
[03:36:58.659 --> 03:37:01.885]  And I'm not going to go out to let the men demand to be in the showers of the girls.
[03:37:01.945 --> 03:37:02.706]  I won't go that far.
[03:37:03.267 --> 03:37:04.129]  But, you know, that's where they are.
[03:37:04.149 --> 03:37:04.410]  Go ahead.
[03:37:05.270 --> 03:37:06.630]  Well, people think we're joking.
[03:37:06.670 --> 03:37:14.092]  Just a couple years ago, there was like a 46 or a 52-year-old obese man who said, I identify as a six-year-old now.
[03:37:14.392 --> 03:37:18.574]  And he found a family to take him in and raise him as if he's a six-year-old girl.
[03:37:18.654 --> 03:37:20.734]  It's absolutely disgusting what goes on out there.
[03:37:20.754 --> 03:37:27.556]  Oh no, leftists make people, they get taxpayer money in San Francisco to be on a chain, and they take the man out and he poops in a field and they pick it up.
[03:37:30.461 --> 03:37:31.822]  It is just, it's disgusting.
[03:37:31.842 --> 03:37:33.644]  And you know, it's this full assault.
[03:37:33.684 --> 03:37:36.607]  Tom, why are you racist against that?
[03:37:36.647 --> 03:37:40.270]  We need to have convicted pedophiles in school with small children.
[03:37:41.191 --> 03:37:41.551]  Right?
[03:37:42.132 --> 03:37:43.032]  Because it's empowering.
[03:37:43.052 --> 03:37:44.414]  You know, we had an article up at Weekly Politics.
[03:37:44.434 --> 03:37:45.835]  We keep the baby comfortable?
[03:37:46.892 --> 03:37:47.472]  That's right.
[03:37:47.973 --> 03:37:51.594]  Well, they actually said, we're going to groom this children.
[03:37:51.634 --> 03:37:52.875]  That's what this is all about.
[03:37:52.975 --> 03:37:57.798]  We're going to groom them to be part of the LGBT community.
[03:37:57.838 --> 03:37:59.719]  Isn't that wonderful and progressive?
[03:37:59.779 --> 03:38:05.501]  And we're just going to have our convicted pedophiles who rape eight-year-old boys come out and we're going to groom you.
[03:38:05.762 --> 03:38:06.462]  Nothing wrong with that.
[03:38:06.482 --> 03:38:08.243]  Pepper, I shouldn't have taken over here today.
[03:38:08.343 --> 03:38:12.385]  What do you have in the segments you have to cover here, Jedi leader?
[03:38:13.348 --> 03:38:16.972]  I've got a lot, because I've been kind of listening to the show and I wanted to keep it in line.
[03:38:17.072 --> 03:38:19.515]  One of the big things to talk about... Are you going to keep the audience comfortable?
[03:38:21.697 --> 03:38:28.364]  And then you and I, as the host and the co-host, the guest host, we will make a decision as to whether or not we should kill the audience, obviously.
[03:38:29.866 --> 03:38:35.312]  We don't want the parents involved, we just kill the baby, all them little goody-toodies.
[03:38:36.563 --> 03:38:44.526]  You know, Ralph Northam is now trying to find people to say that they were in that famous blackface KKK photo.
[03:38:44.566 --> 03:38:49.088]  Because, you know, not only does he like to kill babies, but ostensibly, he hates black people!
[03:38:49.848 --> 03:38:51.308]  And he's trying to find a cover.
[03:38:51.829 --> 03:38:53.169]  I wonder how much he's going to pay for that.
[03:38:53.229 --> 03:38:56.350]  Ralph Northam knows best.
[03:38:56.370 --> 03:38:58.591]  Why are you being bad, Tom?
[03:38:59.451 --> 03:39:01.232]  Just let us kill you, Tom.
[03:39:01.252 --> 03:39:03.913]  Southern oven voice, Tom.
[03:39:06.616 --> 03:39:16.123]  I wonder, did he have this moment with the ethereal George Soros telling him, if he just kills the ba- It's called Southern Lovin' Tom!
[03:39:18.385 --> 03:39:20.406]  It's out of comfort and compassion.
[03:39:20.446 --> 03:39:26.451]  We'll make them comfortable, and then we'll just put the ice pick right in the forehead, and they'll be totally comfortable.
[03:39:26.591 --> 03:39:30.254]  And then we get those little goodie woodies, oh my.
[03:39:31.555 --> 03:39:35.738]  And then you just sell it to the highest bidder, use that to fund your campaign,
[03:39:36.590 --> 03:39:40.732]  Hey, what do you think of the fact that it's coming out that Biden's a CHICOM operative?
[03:39:41.913 --> 03:39:43.314]  You know, it doesn't surprise me.
[03:39:43.394 --> 03:39:45.735]  Biden has so many disgusting things surrounding him.
[03:39:45.835 --> 03:39:51.358]  At Big League Politics, we had an exclusive story where they actually, we have a person who came forward.
[03:39:51.438 --> 03:39:51.778]  Biden's daughter.
[03:39:51.798 --> 03:39:56.560]  I should add, if you're a senior writer at BigLeaguePolitics.com, a total badass.
[03:39:56.600 --> 03:39:57.241]  Tell us about this.
[03:39:58.311 --> 03:40:05.433]  So we had this article where Biden's daughter-in-law, she runs this lawyers for needy people organization that's a total sham.
[03:40:05.453 --> 03:40:07.154]  Which means she swindles the cash, yeah.
[03:40:08.034 --> 03:40:08.995]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:40:09.015 --> 03:40:12.576]  Well, it turns out one of their lawyers, they had this
[03:40:13.766 --> 03:40:24.131]  19, 18-year-old kid who they were representing another guy and he was called in as a witness and this lawyer goes into the men's room with this kid and sexually propositions him.
[03:40:24.211 --> 03:40:26.612]  This is in Joe Biden's daughter-in-law's legal group.
[03:40:27.112 --> 03:40:28.853]  And then they just sweep it under the rug.
[03:40:28.893 --> 03:40:29.833]  Oh, this never happened.
[03:40:29.853 --> 03:40:31.374]  Yeah, we're sorry if you were uncomfortable.
[03:40:31.394 --> 03:40:33.715]  You mean people associated with Biden are grabbing kids?
[03:40:35.896 --> 03:40:38.397]  You're telling me bears live in the woods?
[03:40:39.619 --> 03:40:41.020]  Who could have ever seen this happening?
[03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:44.041]  But you know, so it doesn't surprise me that he's in bed with China.
[03:40:44.121 --> 03:40:49.123]  And in fact, if you look at the company he keeps, Hillary Clinton, we all know what she does with China.
[03:40:49.143 --> 03:40:51.024]  We all know what she does with foreign governments.
[03:40:51.044 --> 03:40:52.625]  So it doesn't surprise me at all.
[03:40:53.945 --> 03:40:56.686]  Papert, you need to join me throughout the week.
[03:40:56.746 --> 03:40:58.247]  What's coming up in the next segment here?
[03:40:59.699 --> 03:41:02.761]  So I thought, since we were talking about Biden, I wanted to talk about that.
[03:41:02.801 --> 03:41:11.106]  We've also got kind of, I want to give some backstory about Rod Rosenstein, because this guy has been a bad actor for a very long time.
[03:41:11.226 --> 03:41:20.952]  He interviewed Hillary Clinton way back in the day, or I'm sorry, I think it was President Bill Clinton, all the way back in Whitewater when he was impeached in the House, but not the Senate, if memory serves.
[03:41:21.372 --> 03:41:23.213]  And it was a 15-minute interview.
[03:41:23.654 --> 03:41:25.795]  It didn't happen where it was supposed to happen.
[03:41:26.500 --> 03:41:33.166]  And then, all these years later, in 2017, when he joined the Trump administration, he lied on his resume.
[03:41:33.546 --> 03:41:42.914]  And he said that at the time that he was interviewing the Clintons about whether or not they broke the law, he said that he was the Attorney General for a state.
[03:41:43.235 --> 03:41:45.076]  Chief Prosecutor for Maryland, I think it was.
[03:41:45.456 --> 03:41:47.158]  So this guy is a real piece of work.
[03:41:47.198 --> 03:41:51.221]  He's the same guy who came out- By the way, I should have led the show, and I'm glad you're gonna do this next segment.
[03:41:51.742 --> 03:41:52.683]  Thank God you're here.
[03:41:53.812 --> 03:41:56.555]  Why is the head of the Air Force Academy stepping down?
[03:41:56.615 --> 03:41:58.176]  Why is that of Guantanamo stepping down?
[03:41:58.557 --> 03:42:03.241]  Why is Rod Rosenstein stepping down?
[03:42:03.261 --> 03:42:10.608]  I'm told the Tea Leaf Show, this is not very good joo-boo-hoo-joo or whatever for the establishment.
[03:42:11.707 --> 03:42:11.967]  Right.
[03:42:12.387 --> 03:42:22.794]  Well, if you look at it, ever since that Mueller report broke, we've had like, what, 10 different top officials now, all throughout the federal government, stepping down, quote unquote.
[03:42:22.814 --> 03:42:24.055]  And we all know the way this works.
[03:42:24.075 --> 03:42:27.037]  When you get to these upper echelons, you get the choice.
[03:42:27.077 --> 03:42:32.741]  They come, they bring you in the office, and they say, all right, you can either step down, or we're going to fire you, and you'll be a public disgrace.
[03:42:32.861 --> 03:42:35.123]  And if they're smart, they'll say, all right, I'll step down.
[03:42:36.143 --> 03:42:37.344]  You see how it works?
[03:42:37.364 --> 03:42:38.545]  You see how it works, Papa?
[03:42:40.092 --> 03:42:42.353]  We're gonna get those little gizzard snippets.
[03:42:43.634 --> 03:42:44.835]  It's all liberal, though.
[03:42:45.475 --> 03:42:48.436]  Tom Pappert is on fire!
[03:42:48.456 --> 03:42:49.977]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:42:50.998 --> 03:42:52.599]  Stay with us for one more segment.
[03:42:52.639 --> 03:42:55.860]  Then, the War Room is ready!
[03:42:56.701 --> 03:42:58.342]  Hillary loves you!
[03:42:58.822 --> 03:43:00.062]  Take the vaccines!
[03:43:00.323 --> 03:43:00.663]  Yes!
[03:43:02.423 --> 03:43:11.315]  Globalism is multinational corporations working with foreign authoritarian countries like China to take over other nation states that have open free societies.
[03:43:11.775 --> 03:43:19.706]  They use our open free society to come in, buy off politicians, buy off other companies to merge and create cartels
[03:43:20.166 --> 03:43:25.771]  Or oligopolies, groups of monopolies working together to dominate and control and consolidate power.
[03:43:26.232 --> 03:43:29.255]  This is how 21st century warfare is carried out.
[03:43:29.675 --> 03:43:39.625]  But nationalists and populists across the world have been awakened to this threat and are taking action to restore control over our lives back to our central and local governments.
[03:43:40.245 --> 03:43:43.867]  This is the fight that the United States is deeply in the middle of right now.
[03:43:44.307 --> 03:44:01.617]  And that's why the globalists, who were arrogant, are now panicking and trying to censor InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and my syndicated radio show because they know we've got our finger on the pulse of what's happening and that the President and the Pentagon and others are listening and know that we're telling the truth and we've basically become
[03:44:01.897 --> 03:44:05.280]  The modern Paul Revere transmission of this republic.
[03:44:05.760 --> 03:44:21.054]  That's why it's so critical for all of you out there watching or listening to remember, without you taking action, without you overcoming the censors, without you by word of mouth, with your human intelligence, overriding the AI censorship, we will be defeated and this restoration of the republic could be defeated.
[03:44:21.474 --> 03:44:26.419]  So please keep spreading the word, and whatever you do, remember, we're only financed now by you.
[03:44:26.920 --> 03:44:27.721]  We're in your hands.
[03:44:27.741 --> 03:44:29.022]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:29.243 --> 03:44:37.091]  We've got huge specials running on a continued basis, hundreds of great products, things you and your family already need, like fluoride-free toothpaste, high-quality
[03:44:38.052 --> 03:44:42.977]  Again, the highest quality organic coffee that people absolutely love.
[03:44:43.437 --> 03:44:45.299]  Great protein bars and so much more.
[03:44:45.559 --> 03:44:48.362]  When you sign up for auto shipping, you get an additional 10% off on future orders.
[03:44:48.862 --> 03:44:54.467]  Come to m4workstore.com today and continue to support free speech and freedom at the tip of the spear.
[03:44:54.708 --> 03:44:57.971]  Thank you all for your support and God bless you and God bless America.
[03:45:03.331 --> 03:45:12.256]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA, that's the antioxidant that's next level.
[03:45:12.416 --> 03:45:21.221]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[03:45:21.401 --> 03:45:22.121]  It's ridiculous.
[03:45:22.241 --> 03:45:22.681]  The CoQ10, PPQ,
[03:45:23.922 --> 03:45:27.183]  We have the organically derived, and by that, it's not synthetic.
[03:45:27.443 --> 03:45:32.824]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even a synthetic's expensive.
[03:45:32.944 --> 03:45:35.064]  This is the organically derived.
[03:45:35.464 --> 03:45:36.364]  This is the real stuff.
[03:45:36.564 --> 03:45:46.446]  I want to warn you, though, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off, like, 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there, we're cut off.
[03:45:46.666 --> 03:45:47.987]  It was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[03:45:48.007 --> 03:45:49.707]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[03:45:50.647 --> 03:45:51.168]  Tore it off.
[03:45:51.428 --> 03:45:52.869]  It was numb all the way up here.
[03:45:53.009 --> 03:45:55.150]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[03:45:55.350 --> 03:45:56.911]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[03:45:56.951 --> 03:45:58.432]  First it tingled and it came back.
[03:45:58.632 --> 03:46:00.593]  I was like, this is incredible, but I'm going to warn you.
[03:46:00.793 --> 03:46:05.336]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[03:46:05.516 --> 03:46:09.278]  This is just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[03:46:09.478 --> 03:46:11.799]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[03:46:12.040 --> 03:46:15.001]  So it's the building blocks and it's the next level.
[03:46:15.041 --> 03:46:15.982]  It's the best you're going to get.
[03:46:16.102 --> 03:46:17.983]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing?
[03:46:18.043 --> 03:46:19.704]  Like six years ago, we're getting into supplements.
[03:46:19.924 --> 03:46:21.746]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[03:46:21.906 --> 03:46:27.092]  But mainly, people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[03:46:27.292 --> 03:46:33.800]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks, and it's a 6, 7 times markup.
[03:46:35.101 --> 03:46:39.265]  Make it up 150% when we discount it 20-30% down to $119.
[03:46:39.465 --> 03:46:43.048]  They're still, again, most of the cost is the product.
[03:46:43.168 --> 03:46:44.169]  It's 20% off.
[03:46:44.289 --> 03:46:46.591]  Profitably make funds this operation.
[03:46:47.072 --> 03:46:49.013]  97% reviews.
[03:46:49.033 --> 03:46:50.214]  4.7 power reviews, third party.
[03:46:50.355 --> 03:46:52.236]  Please go read the reviews for yourself.
[03:46:52.496 --> 03:46:53.597]  DNA Force Plus.
[03:46:53.698 --> 03:46:54.879]  Infowarestore.com.
[03:46:54.979 --> 03:46:56.820]  It costs a lot because it's worth a lot.
[03:46:56.940 --> 03:46:57.681]  It's next level.
[03:46:57.781 --> 03:46:59.082]  Infowarestore.com.
[03:46:59.383 --> 03:47:00.984]  Fueling the human revolution.
[03:47:06.661 --> 03:47:09.253]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:32.359 --> 03:47:35.443]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:35.523 --> 03:47:37.986]  I am Tom Papert, Facebook's God-Emperor Trump.
[03:47:38.006 --> 03:47:39.447]  Thank you all so much for watching today.
[03:47:39.527 --> 03:47:40.809]  Alex is having a lot of fun.
[03:47:41.350 --> 03:47:47.577]  Was that not some fascinating video that Millie Weaver got at the Joe Biden rally?
[03:47:47.617 --> 03:47:50.280]  And of course, Biden is now a vice presidential candidate.
[03:47:50.780 --> 03:47:55.125]  Sleepy Joe, as President Trump calls him, he was teasing it for like two and a half months.
[03:47:55.225 --> 03:47:55.946]  Will he run?
[03:47:56.106 --> 03:47:56.787]  Won't he run?
[03:47:56.847 --> 03:48:03.955]  And part of me thought that he was going to do a repeat of 2016 where he said one of his biggest regrets was not just hopping in the race.
[03:48:04.807 --> 03:48:08.768]  But Joe Biden was roundly mocked for his really kind of strange speech.
[03:48:08.808 --> 03:48:12.288]  Again, we learned from Millie Weaver, 240 people in that crowd.
[03:48:12.648 --> 03:48:19.950]  President Trump says the night before, I'm going to be at such and such arena, 20,000 people, 10,000 people waiting outside.
[03:48:20.210 --> 03:48:25.831]  You literally cannot get into the Trump rallies if you're not there three, four, five hours early standing in line.
[03:48:25.851 --> 03:48:31.452]  People are camping overnight, but Joe Biden gets 240 people, so therefore he's going to defeat Trump is what they tell us.
[03:48:32.958 --> 03:48:35.059]  He was roundly mocked, as I said.
[03:48:36.100 --> 03:48:40.682]  We can get into the medical issues that Joe Biden has had that might have led to some of his slurring.
[03:48:41.062 --> 03:48:56.449]  But of course, if you do that, then they're just going to say that he's in the best health of his life, a la Hillary Clinton in 2016, where they maintained that even though she had the weird head motions, she couldn't be outside for more than 20-30 minutes, she had three or four days in between speeches, they maintained that she was completely healthy.
[03:48:56.489 --> 03:48:58.890]  So, we'll just totally brush all that aside.
[03:48:58.910 --> 03:48:59.811]  We've got an article up.
[03:49:00.111 --> 03:49:06.561]  Here at BigLeaguePolitics.com, Biden's painful slurring campaign speech garners mockery and
[03:49:07.059 --> 03:49:11.181]  I have to say, I love what our Editor-in-Chief of Big League Politics, Patrick Howley, did here.
[03:49:11.221 --> 03:49:13.362]  He's got this great way of getting people.
[03:49:13.403 --> 03:49:14.943]  It's the opposite of clickbait, really.
[03:49:14.983 --> 03:49:19.886]  You think you're going to be reading this little puff piece about how Joe Biden is a disgrace, and then bam!
[03:49:20.066 --> 03:49:22.688]  He hits you with the giant red pill.
[03:49:23.128 --> 03:49:28.111]  Because just here recently, we had a longer article up at Big League Politics, and we talked about this.
[03:49:28.411 --> 03:49:30.192]  Alex and I did a little bit in the last segment.
[03:49:31.468 --> 03:49:44.456]  Joe Biden's daughter-in-law, Kathleen Biden, operates this weird little group called DC Volunteer Lawyers Project, which according to the person who made the accusation that I'm about to get to, it's not volunteer.
[03:49:44.476 --> 03:49:45.777]  They get paid very well.
[03:49:46.317 --> 03:49:50.980]  They get a lot of money from their clients and from shady resources, but allegedly,
[03:49:51.829 --> 03:50:01.397]  Kathleen Biden, she has this group and there's this lawyer in it, or there was, and he was representing a young child in a custody case.
[03:50:02.078 --> 03:50:04.540]  The parents, the mother wanted to homeschool.
[03:50:04.900 --> 03:50:07.002]  The father said homeschooling is bad.
[03:50:07.422 --> 03:50:12.487]  And so they bring in the lawyers, they've got to go before the judge, etc, etc, etc.
[03:50:12.587 --> 03:50:13.548]  We all know how this works.
[03:50:14.048 --> 03:50:14.548]  And the D.C.
[03:50:14.588 --> 03:50:17.849]  Volunteer Lawyers was supposed to be helping out the people who wanted to homeschool.
[03:50:17.869 --> 03:50:20.250]  Well, they call in a witness who is an older kid.
[03:50:20.310 --> 03:50:21.830]  He's graduated from high school.
[03:50:21.970 --> 03:50:24.191]  He's 18, 19, somewhere in that age range.
[03:50:25.071 --> 03:50:27.852]  And so they bring him in as a witness to say, look, I was homeschooled.
[03:50:27.892 --> 03:50:28.732]  I turned out great.
[03:50:28.772 --> 03:50:31.233]  I did the best in my job.
[03:50:31.293 --> 03:50:34.194]  I've got a great education after high school, etc., etc.
[03:50:35.334 --> 03:50:39.115]  Well, it turns out this lawyer, this is what they're alleging, at least.
[03:50:40.455 --> 03:50:46.749]  They go, the guy testifies, they bring him back in again, as is often the case in court proceedings.
[03:50:47.270 --> 03:50:55.553]  So he goes to the restroom to relieve himself and this lawyer follows him in and says, you know, you're a very fine looking young man.
[03:50:55.613 --> 03:50:57.033]  You're, you're a handsome guy.
[03:50:57.093 --> 03:50:59.094]  I think you'd be, I think you should do modeling.
[03:50:59.154 --> 03:51:02.355]  I think you should come over to my house and I'm having this great house party.
[03:51:02.375 --> 03:51:06.697]  We're going to have all kinds of great people there and we really need a, a great looking guy like you.
[03:51:07.077 --> 03:51:16.800]  And he takes out a business card, presumably while they're standing at the urinal, and he writes down his address on there and his contact information on there and he hands it to this kid.
[03:51:17.901 --> 03:51:27.548]  And I say kid, 18 is legally an adult, but in 21st century America, it's very rare to find an 18-year-old who acts and thinks like an adult, and your brain isn't even done developing.
[03:51:27.588 --> 03:51:43.739]  So this kid walks out of the bathroom, and he hands the card to his mom, and he relays this weirdo story that he just encountered, and the only thing they can think is that he was propositioning him in the men's bathroom of a DC courthouse.
[03:51:44.645 --> 03:51:45.866]  This is the Biden family.
[03:51:45.966 --> 03:51:54.532]  So when Alex Jones broke the story earlier today, it's up on InfoWars.com, of course, that Joe Biden has all kinds of China ties.
[03:51:54.972 --> 03:51:56.153]  It doesn't surprise me at all.
[03:51:56.173 --> 03:52:05.559]  Of course, everybody remembers the Clinton administration was essentially selling nights in what was it, the Lincoln bedroom to China, giving China all kinds of preferential treatment.
[03:52:05.960 --> 03:52:12.144]  Obama did absolutely nothing to go after China, which has been ripping our country off in intellectual property.
[03:52:12.404 --> 03:52:14.386]  We have the world's worst unfair trade deals.
[03:52:14.766 --> 03:52:21.471]  In fact, TPP would have been a disaster for the United States economy and it was pushed by the Obama administration.
[03:52:21.992 --> 03:52:32.680]  These globalists, and I think it's because they profit off of it clearly, these globalists have absolutely nothing wrong with China becoming the new global hegemon of the planet.
[03:52:33.020 --> 03:52:34.641]  That's really what they, they think it'll be great.
[03:52:35.062 --> 03:52:36.002]  Let China take over.
[03:52:36.043 --> 03:52:37.704]  This will be the Chinese millennium.
[03:52:38.271 --> 03:52:43.214]  Chinese have documents from the 90s where they're saying, how we will make this the Chinese millennium.
[03:52:43.314 --> 03:52:44.935]  And the globalists are totally all for it.
[03:52:44.955 --> 03:52:47.016]  There's no doubt in my mind.
[03:52:47.597 --> 03:52:49.638]  So I just wanted to put that tidbit in there.
[03:52:49.678 --> 03:52:51.339]  Of course, watch Millie Weaver's videos.
[03:52:51.359 --> 03:52:53.900]  They're up at newswars.com, infowars.com.
[03:52:53.920 --> 03:52:56.242]  Millie does amazing work, and she has for many years.
[03:52:56.642 --> 03:52:57.983]  And my goodness, it's so insane.
[03:52:58.023 --> 03:53:01.065]  I've been watching her since I was a kid.
[03:53:01.465 --> 03:53:02.846]  And now she's got kids of her own.
[03:53:02.886 --> 03:53:06.008]  It's amazing how we all grow up in this amazing liberty movement.
[03:53:07.469 --> 03:53:09.890]  Rod Rosenstein has resigned.
[03:53:10.590 --> 03:53:13.231]  The Deep State apparently is in chaos.
[03:53:13.291 --> 03:53:22.334]  As Alex and I were talking about just a minute or two ago, we've had something like 10 or 12 top Deep State actors resign in the last two weeks.
[03:53:22.414 --> 03:53:26.856]  Ever since the Mueller report was released in its redacted form, we all learned there was no obstruction.
[03:53:27.136 --> 03:53:28.657]  We all learned there was no collusion.
[03:53:28.897 --> 03:53:30.337]  We learned some shocking things.
[03:53:30.978 --> 03:53:32.018]  We learned, for instance,
[03:53:32.671 --> 03:53:45.182]  That the Russians spent a very small amount of money in the wider scheme of things, but they also spent that money pushing Black Lives Matter, pushing the LGBTQIAA++P agenda.
[03:53:45.662 --> 03:53:48.004]  They were also pushing Islam.
[03:53:48.204 --> 03:53:54.470]  Basically, anything they could do, including pushing Bernie Sanders, to destroy America's societal cohesion.
[03:53:54.890 --> 03:54:00.113]  And if you look around, with that small amount of money they invested in those ads, they seem to have been quite successful.
[03:54:00.153 --> 03:54:03.875]  But I wanted to expand on something that I talked about with Alex in the last segment.
[03:54:03.915 --> 03:54:09.619]  Rod Rosenstein, a lot of people have been critical about him since day one, and with good reason.
[03:54:10.359 --> 03:54:19.524]  He basically, he had a 15 minute interview with the Clintons to determine if they lied to Congress about the famous blue dress humidor, Monica Lewinsky.
[03:54:19.544 --> 03:54:20.665]  15 minute interview.
[03:54:21.286 --> 03:54:28.837]  So, this happened obviously way back in the 90s, but it's also worth mentioning that Rosenstein basically lied.
[03:54:29.338 --> 03:54:31.421]  Because when that interview occurred...
[03:54:32.381 --> 03:54:35.642]  Rosenstein said he was working somewhere completely different.
[03:54:36.162 --> 03:54:40.064]  That's what he told the Trump administration when he got hired all the way back in 2017.
[03:54:40.964 --> 03:54:45.446]  Rosenstein has also been the guy who famously said, well what do you want me to do?
[03:54:45.526 --> 03:54:46.326]  Wear a wire?
[03:54:46.386 --> 03:54:48.807]  Should I wear a wire when I talk to President Trump?
[03:54:48.827 --> 03:54:50.347]  Do I need to wear a wire?
[03:54:50.367 --> 03:54:57.890]  This guy is, you just look at his face, and I know that this is a little bit like low-hanging fruit, but this guy does not look trustworthy to me.
[03:54:58.270 --> 03:55:01.151]  He's raising his hand and he just looks like a weasel.
[03:55:01.781 --> 03:55:04.545]  He really looks like a strange weasel creature.
[03:55:05.286 --> 03:55:06.467]  So I'm glad that he's gone.
[03:55:06.888 --> 03:55:10.612]  But was his resignation letter not very strange?
[03:55:11.193 --> 03:55:13.236]  He thanked President Trump for his humor?
[03:55:13.894 --> 03:55:18.035]  He thanked President Trump for his campaign promises and what he said at the inauguration.
[03:55:18.295 --> 03:55:22.697]  He noted that he served longer than the majority of deputy AGs before him.
[03:55:22.737 --> 03:55:27.378]  He said that the average span is just 16 months, and he lasted a full 24.
[03:55:27.559 --> 03:55:34.061]  It was very strange, and he seemed to throw all kinds of America First rhetoric right back in the president's face.
[03:55:34.441 --> 03:55:35.581]  And you can read that two ways.
[03:55:35.601 --> 03:55:40.983]  You can read that one, he's trying to say that he was really a patriot, he was really working for America's best interests all along.
[03:55:41.858 --> 03:55:46.961]  Or you can read that as saying, I'm going to code my language to insult the president.
[03:55:47.001 --> 03:55:52.724]  I'm going to code my language to make it sound like President Trump is the one not keeping his campaign promises.
[03:55:53.184 --> 03:55:55.145]  And so I just find that absolutely fascinating.
[03:55:55.165 --> 03:55:57.407]  And I am incredibly optimistic.
[03:55:57.607 --> 03:56:03.090]  If you look at what's going on, President Trump is seemingly cleaning house.
[03:56:03.885 --> 03:56:05.766]  And that's been needed for a very long time.
[03:56:05.786 --> 03:56:21.490]  Of course, Steve Bannon said it was the original sin of the Trump administration that in a desperate effort to staff the government as quickly as possible so they could enact the president's agenda, they brought in all of these people who are essentially the deep state, who are the Republican establishment.
[03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:24.971]  They have Kasich people working in the White House.
[03:56:25.011 --> 03:56:27.552]  They have Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio clowns
[03:56:28.112 --> 03:56:29.054]  We're good to go.
[03:56:41.132 --> 03:56:47.597]  That means the President is going to go after these big tech platforms for censoring Alex Jones and so many other fantastic people.
[03:56:48.078 --> 03:56:50.480]  Myself, I'm still on Facebook, God Emperor Trump.
[03:56:50.520 --> 03:56:52.301]  I'm still on Twitter, at RealGETrump.
[03:56:52.341 --> 03:56:53.042]  Find me, please!
[03:56:53.562 --> 03:56:55.524]  But let me tell you folks, the shadow ban is real.
[03:56:55.564 --> 03:56:59.587]  We do probably half of what we did two years ago, and it was flipped like a switch.
[03:56:59.647 --> 03:57:01.288]  This wasn't a gradual decline.
[03:57:01.328 --> 03:57:04.171]  You can look at the ratings, and it goes bing, and then down.
[03:57:04.271 --> 03:57:05.372]  Drops off like a rock.
[03:57:05.392 --> 03:57:06.993]  We're still reaching millions, and I'm thankful.
[03:57:07.719 --> 03:57:16.725]  So as we get to the last few seconds here, I want to remind everybody to watch War Room with Owen Schreier coming up next, right here on InfoWars.com slash show.
[03:57:16.745 --> 03:57:22.589]  I also want to remind everybody to go try some of these amazing products that you can get at the InfoWars studio right now.
[03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:24.550]  This one here, X2.
[03:57:25.010 --> 03:57:31.054]  I've actually never tried X3 because I was lucky I got X2 before they temporarily lost it at the InfoWars
[03:57:34.426 --> 03:57:40.010]  Truly a life-changing experience having some real iodine in my system that doesn't come from salt.
[03:57:40.271 --> 03:57:42.612]  Fortunately, we don't have fluoride where I live, so that's nice.
[03:57:43.273 --> 03:57:44.014]  I'm Tom Paffert.
[03:57:44.074 --> 03:57:45.995]  This has been the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:46.055 --> 03:57:47.016]  Find me on Facebook.
[03:57:47.056 --> 03:57:49.157]  I do a live show every night 8 p.m.
[03:57:49.338 --> 03:57:49.778]  Central.
[03:57:50.218 --> 03:57:51.099]  God Emperor Trump.
[03:57:51.139 --> 03:57:51.860]  Thanks for watching.
[03:57:51.880 --> 03:57:52.400]  We'll see you next time.
[03:57:54.639 --> 03:57:55.619]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[03:57:55.859 --> 03:57:57.360]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[03:57:57.440 --> 03:57:57.820]  Hello.
[03:57:57.940 --> 03:58:02.842]  Alex, if I can just quickly, InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you for Polnblock.
[03:58:03.062 --> 03:58:03.682]  It's amazing.
[03:58:03.802 --> 03:58:09.584]  I've used so many different antihistamines over the years because I get really bad hay fever, and the antihistamines
[03:58:09.964 --> 03:58:13.907]  Sometimes work, sometimes don't, but they never quite work fully.
[03:58:13.927 --> 03:58:16.608]  They don't block all the symptoms, they just kind of dry you up.
[03:58:16.628 --> 03:58:18.930]  Or at least that's what they do for me, if they work at all.
[03:58:18.970 --> 03:58:20.451]  But pollen block, it works.
[03:58:20.671 --> 03:58:21.612]  It stops everything.
[03:58:21.732 --> 03:58:25.774]  I don't get the itchy eyes, I'm not sneezing, and I don't get the irritation.
[03:58:25.914 --> 03:58:26.635]  It is amazing.
[03:58:26.735 --> 03:58:28.977]  This is a known patent out of France.
[03:58:28.997 --> 03:58:39.668]  You have to pay for the patent, where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[03:58:39.848 --> 03:58:42.231]  How fast did it take for pollen block to kick in for you?
[03:58:42.731 --> 03:58:45.835]  It's pretty much straight away, you know, in maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[03:58:45.976 --> 03:58:46.677]  It just works.
[03:58:46.897 --> 03:58:57.472]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms, and even then, they might not kick in for half an hour, or they might not kick in at all, depending on the day.
[03:58:57.492 --> 03:58:59.455]  Polonblock works every single time.
