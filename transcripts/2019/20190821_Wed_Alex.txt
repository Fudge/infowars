[00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:53.089]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide on this Wednesday, August 21st, 2019 transmission.
[00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.510]  And all hell is continuing to break loose.
[00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:06.317]  We've got three of our intrepid reporters, Gregory, Savannah, Hernandez, and others on the ground right now in Hong Kong.
[00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:11.479]  Where hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops are threatening to invade.
[00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.100]  They're going to be on with us coming up in about 15 minutes.
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.062]  Then, Carpe D'Antem, one of the top memers on the planet, goes and visits Trump at the White House.
[00:01:20.062 --> 00:01:22.322]  He launches memeworld.com.
[00:01:22.322 --> 00:01:26.144]  Starts getting banned on Facebook and other platforms within hours.
[00:01:26.144 --> 00:01:27.324]  All part of election meddling 2020.
[00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:34.308]  And Trump's aware of it and speaking out against it, but he needs to take action.
[00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:45.020]  Speaking of Carpe D'Antem, here's a nice little three and a half minute trailer that got him in so much trouble.
[00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.605]  I just came outside to try to process all this.
[00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:55.518]  I want you to create the best memes the world has ever seen.
[00:01:55.518 --> 00:02:00.061]  With your help, we are going to make America great again.
[00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:05.705]  Gangnam Style!
[00:02:11.684 --> 00:02:12.304]  I don't know.
[00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:59.259]  Watch this.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.741]  The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House.
[00:03:43.741 --> 00:03:45.842]  But I'm president, and they're not.
[00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:46.582]  Go home, democracy!
[00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:47.162]  Go home!
[00:03:47.162 --> 00:03:47.262]  Bye!
[00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:19.617]  Yeah.
[00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:15.342]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[00:05:15.342 --> 00:05:17.063]  It is completely independent of all that.
[00:05:17.063 --> 00:05:27.952]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[00:05:28.152 --> 00:05:28.732]  We're good.
[00:05:58.112 --> 00:06:02.014]  Let's do it!
[00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:38.653]  It's August 21st, 2019 on this Wednesday edition of The Transmission.
[00:06:38.653 --> 00:06:40.094]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:40.094 --> 00:06:42.455]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:45.536]  Well, we've got a full raft of guests.
[00:06:45.536 --> 00:06:49.158]  We've got three of our reporters and camera crew in Hong Kong.
[00:06:49.898 --> 00:06:52.982]  Where the Chai Koms have already sent in paramilitary police.
[00:06:52.982 --> 00:06:54.624]  They've had over a million people protest.
[00:06:54.624 --> 00:06:56.566]  That's one-seventh of the island.
[00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:59.350]  They've had huge demonstrations coming up this weekend.
[00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:07.940]  And the Chinese military is massing hundreds of thousands of troops, tanks, armored vehicles, threatening to invade Hong Kong over the bridge the Chinese built.
[00:07:08.863 --> 00:07:15.086]  In the last few years, they said for commerce, but now it's all known that it's for the invasion.
[00:07:15.086 --> 00:07:19.087]  So, Savannah Hernandez, Greg Reese, and others reporting from there.
[00:07:19.087 --> 00:07:22.649]  Carpe Donctum was banned.
[00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:29.251]  He was banned by Facebook two hours after he officially launched MemeWorld.com.
[00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:37.615]  Last time I was talking to him off air during the break, he said, hey, in a few months, we're going to launch a big meme site because, you know,
[00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.953]  The Reddit, Donald been frozen, still frozen.
[00:07:41.953 --> 00:07:44.475]  All these other meme sites are getting taken down on Facebook, off Twitter.
[00:07:44.475 --> 00:07:55.763]  200 million users just a few weeks ago on Twitter and on Facebook and a bunch of other platforms like Instagram got taken down in just one day or two days.
[00:07:55.763 --> 00:08:00.927]  So it's just huge the way they're just exterminating human communication.
[00:08:00.927 --> 00:08:04.270]  If you're a Christian, if you're a conservative, if you're a nationalist.
[00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.752]  And it's exactly the same stuff that Communist China
[00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:19.243]  is using against its people, not letting them share emojis of Winnie the Pooh, not letting them share emojis of the Taiwanese flag or the Hong Kong Independence Party.
[00:08:19.243 --> 00:08:22.844]  And Big Tech works hand in glove with them to carry all of that out.
[00:08:22.844 --> 00:08:32.868]  So the global Chinese social credit score is now here, and they're already using it to affect millions and millions of people in China, and they're out face scanning
[00:08:34.302 --> 00:08:44.266]  The people in Taiwan and in Hong Kong, if they're at the demonstrations, and then they're learning that they can't buy and sell on the Chinese controlled systems.
[00:08:44.266 --> 00:08:55.371]  So that's why we need real independence in banking, real independence in computing, because this police state system, this market abuse system, is unfolding worldwide.
[00:08:55.371 --> 00:08:58.092]  And then we've got Zach Voorhees, the
[00:08:59.344 --> 00:09:06.089]  Google engineer, the Ed Snowden of whistleblowers, as others have described him from inside Google.
[00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:10.832]  He's going to be in studio for two hours with us.
[00:09:10.832 --> 00:09:14.475]  And then we also have another guest joining us from the UK.
[00:09:14.475 --> 00:09:14.775]  And that's.
[00:09:16.096 --> 00:09:35.937]  Jada Franson, one of the main leaders resisting the globalists, a very well-spoken lovely lady, she'll be joining us coming up for part of the fourth hour as well that I will be hosting because Paul Joseph Watson is getting ready to also go on another trip to report from another
[00:09:37.017 --> 00:09:38.678]  Hot bed location.
[00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:39.999]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:42.121]  And that's going to be kicking off starting Friday.
[00:09:42.121 --> 00:09:52.688]  So a lot of surprises, a lot of interesting curveballs to get thrown at the globalists that are going to be coming up and that are going to be unfolding here in the next few days.
[00:09:52.688 --> 00:09:55.610]  Let me get into some of the other news.
[00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:03.936]  You'll remember I had Ted Nugent on about two weeks ago and he said, look, you need to trust President Trump.
[00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:06.118]  He's not going to sign expanded background checks.
[00:10:07.043 --> 00:10:10.267]  And Trump announced that that's shelved.
[00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:12.149]  Yes, Ivanka is running around pushing it.
[00:10:14.298 --> 00:10:19.281]  He's never touched a gun, and that's all politics, hoping that that takes heat off Trump.
[00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:20.642]  It's the wrong thing to do.
[00:10:20.642 --> 00:10:27.387]  They need to come out and say, it's mental illness, it's people on Prozac-type drugs that caused you to do this, the inserts admit it.
[00:10:27.387 --> 00:10:31.810]  It's the fact that almost all these shooters were already telling people they were going to go kill.
[00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:39.315]  Whether it was Parkland, with the scumbag Cruz, or this other individual up in Ohio, they were antifa, they were devil worshippers.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.743]  They said what they were going to do, but now the article just went live on Infowars.com.
[00:10:44.743 --> 00:10:46.004]  We have the quotes here.
[00:10:46.004 --> 00:11:01.194]  The NRA and Trump have said that he thought maybe expanded background checks, but then he learned that wouldn't have helped because these people all passed background checks or it was never computerized that they'd already been in a mental institution.
[00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:04.993]  But they've already been adjudicated not to be able to own firearms.
[00:11:04.993 --> 00:11:09.715]  So Trump's cement stance on wide-ranging background checks and call with the NRA.
[00:11:09.715 --> 00:11:16.339]  CNN is very unhappy to have to report that that is not going forward with the unconstitutional red flag laws.
[00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:24.184]  So good job folks putting major heat on Trump so that he would not listen to the Koch brothers.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.326]  Faction of Republicans that are inside his administration and are trying to undermine him.
[00:11:31.326 --> 00:11:37.992]  Speaking of trying to undermine, Scaramucci is totally completely sold out.
[00:11:37.992 --> 00:11:46.141]  He was probably a mole from the beginning of the establishment, but now he's trying to organize and lead the opposition
[00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.351]  To take down President Trump.
[00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:52.813]  And it turns out the mooch betrays the President of America.
[00:11:52.813 --> 00:11:59.116]  Joined Clintons and the Rothschilds at Martha's Vineyard last weekend.
[00:11:59.116 --> 00:12:06.620]  So it's a Clinton scheme to cook up a way to take down the President.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.642]  We're going to be getting into that as well here today.
[00:12:10.642 --> 00:12:12.183]  And then something I think is a great idea.
[00:12:13.971 --> 00:12:19.792]  To spur the economy because the Federal Reserve raised interest rates all those times to hurt the economy.
[00:12:19.792 --> 00:12:28.774]  And the Democrats admit they're trying to kill the economy to stop the populist awakening from firmly cementing itself.
[00:12:28.774 --> 00:12:36.856]  Well, we now hear that Trump wants to cut the payroll tax a day after the White House denies it.
[00:12:38.254 --> 00:12:41.475]  And it's now confirmed that they want to cut some of the payroll tax.
[00:12:41.475 --> 00:12:48.957]  The average worker has matching money taken out, and then employers have to put money in there.
[00:12:48.957 --> 00:12:57.959]  But then instead of the federal government on top of everything, and if you want to spur the economy, you cut part of that payroll tax.
[00:12:57.959 --> 00:13:01.900]  China has 0% taxes on corporations.
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.920]  Trump got our stuff from 40 to 15.
[00:13:05.703 --> 00:13:07.664]  Again, people say, oh, you're trying to make corporations more money.
[00:13:07.664 --> 00:13:13.426]  They wrote the laws to keep the jobs over in China, to make it one-sided and screw us over.
[00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:18.308]  Look at the Washington Post in this very revealing article.
[00:13:18.308 --> 00:13:23.190]  Xi's choice, destroy Trump or save him and weaken America.
[00:13:24.879 --> 00:13:29.062]  Oh, Z is the savior of America if he can only defeat Trump.
[00:13:29.062 --> 00:13:30.223]  Wow, sick!
[00:13:30.223 --> 00:13:34.005]  But that's like Davos two and a half years ago, where he came and said, I'll defeat Trump.
[00:13:34.005 --> 00:13:35.026]  We'll defeat their economy.
[00:13:35.026 --> 00:13:37.908]  But now there's the rebranding that China's good.
[00:13:37.908 --> 00:13:42.490]  And now I'm going to tell you the rest of the story about this situation.
[00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.733]  I was talking to one of my longtime crew members.
[00:13:45.733 --> 00:13:49.795]  He's worked with me for 16, 17 years.
[00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:51.036]  He didn't want to say his name.
[00:13:51.036 --> 00:13:53.417]  He didn't want to go on air.
[00:13:53.417 --> 00:13:54.018]  His sister,
[00:13:56.345 --> 00:13:59.448]  Lives in Minnesota and is a big leftist.
[00:13:59.448 --> 00:14:10.096]  And his sister will not even talk to his mother, and they've always had a good relationship, because she's a Trump supporter.
[00:14:10.096 --> 00:14:17.983]  And she barely talks to her brother because he's a Trump supporter, but she's withholding the children.
[00:14:17.983 --> 00:14:23.708]  And when this crew member saw her last, she's gotten more radicalized.
[00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:38.698]  She was saying, China is the hero and will defeat the evil America, and that white people are inherently bad, and that white people are the problem, and that white people are the enemy.
[00:14:38.698 --> 00:14:46.561]  Now, these folks are blonde-haired, blue-eyed, Norwegian, German stock, like a lot of Minnesotans are.
[00:14:46.561 --> 00:14:53.263]  And so I want that to sink in, that this is someone I've known, actually 17 years, friend of mine,
[00:14:54.181 --> 00:15:20.966]  Met his family before, and the family's being torn apart because the sister is so brainwashed, so brainwashed, and his dad died a few years ago, so brainwashed that she won't even let the grandchildren see the grandmother and believes that whites need to basically be gotten rid of.
[00:15:20.966 --> 00:15:23.307]  Now, I can't even put these clips together anymore.
[00:15:25.814 --> 00:15:38.745]  Because there's so many every day, but I'm gonna go back and ask some of the crew to try to just get the last few weeks of CNN and MSNBC saying whites are inherently evil, whites are inherently bad, and it's gonna be great once whites are gone.
[00:15:38.745 --> 00:15:47.332]  I mean, Anderson Cooper said it last week, there's two new clips today, that it's just, it is the most Hitlerian ideology, but inverted onto white people.
[00:15:47.612 --> 00:15:49.094]  The left is pure evil.
[00:15:49.094 --> 00:15:50.496]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:15:59.338 --> 00:16:03.260]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.801]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:04.801 --> 00:16:07.763]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:07.763 --> 00:16:13.327]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:13.327 --> 00:16:14.528]  I can help you, too.

[00:17:58.916 --> 00:18:00.237]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[00:18:00.237 --> 00:18:01.017]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[00:18:01.017 --> 00:18:01.598]  Thanks for holding.
[00:18:01.598 --> 00:18:01.938]  Hey, Alex.
[00:18:01.938 --> 00:18:04.940]  Yeah, I just want to say, uh, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:11.064]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[00:18:11.064 --> 00:18:19.870]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:20.450]  That's it.
[00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.672]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[00:18:23.672 --> 00:18:26.534]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[00:18:26.534 --> 00:18:27.815]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:28.735]  I agree entirely.
[00:18:28.735 --> 00:18:34.177]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[00:18:34.177 --> 00:18:36.958]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[00:18:36.958 --> 00:18:39.018]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[00:18:39.018 --> 00:18:48.261]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:50.182]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[00:18:50.182 --> 00:18:56.664]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[00:18:56.664 --> 00:18:57.604]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[00:18:58.857 --> 00:19:12.028]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[00:19:12.028 --> 00:19:14.951]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[00:19:14.951 --> 00:19:16.712]  farming goods a week ago.
[00:19:16.712 --> 00:19:20.356]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[00:19:20.996 --> 00:19:25.538]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[00:19:25.538 --> 00:19:26.578]  That's beautiful.
[00:19:26.578 --> 00:19:28.499]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[00:19:28.499 --> 00:19:30.099]  And we aren't going to back down.
[00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:37.682]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[00:19:37.682 --> 00:19:40.023]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[00:19:40.023 --> 00:19:44.184]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:45.125]  And I'm asking listeners,
[00:19:45.905 --> 00:19:50.030]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.131]  We are the resistance.
[00:19:51.131 --> 00:20:01.903]  We are 1776 Worldwide!
[00:20:01.903 --> 00:20:04.546]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:45.021 --> 00:20:47.122]  The Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.
[00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:49.223]  That's where they're going to be going tomorrow.
[00:20:49.223 --> 00:20:51.625]  It's one of the biggest bridges in the world.
[00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:54.306]  The Communist Chinese said they were building it for commerce.
[00:20:54.306 --> 00:20:56.648]  But others warn the bridge just got completed a few years ago.
[00:20:57.492 --> 00:21:01.735]  was being built so they could invade Hong Kong and take it over.
[00:21:01.735 --> 00:21:10.820]  That's where everybody ran in 1949 when Mao Zedong took over the country and began killing tens of millions of people.
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:16.304]  When they were all done, over 115 million people were dead.
[00:21:16.304 --> 00:21:24.549]  We're going to put on screen for you images of that bridge so you can get an idea of all of this and that there are massing
[00:21:26.232 --> 00:21:31.358]  Massing hundreds of thousands of Chinese troops and armored vehicles and tanks.
[00:21:31.358 --> 00:21:32.680]  That's on the news.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:40.549]  They've already sent in thousands of men on motorcycles to beat and attack men, women, and children with metal rods, with metal poles.
[00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:44.754]  This is where the real rebellion against tyranny is going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:44.754 --> 00:21:45.595]  This is where 70 years ago,
[00:21:47.168 --> 00:21:49.271]  Millions and millions of people escaped.
[00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:56.061]  Hong Kong was a bustling center of commerce, but nothing like it is today, and millions have demonstrated.
[00:21:57.125 --> 00:22:01.188]  Over half the public in polls does not want to be part of Communist China.
[00:22:01.188 --> 00:22:03.670]  That's why they're waving American flags.
[00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.093]  So they're going to be talking to the demonstrators as that happens over the next few days.
[00:22:07.093 --> 00:22:08.834]  The Chi-Coms could invade any day.
[00:22:08.834 --> 00:22:15.759]  They're going to be going and showing folks the bridge and talking to others about what is it like in a country that's about to be invaded.
[00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:20.603]  It will be much more explosive than Tiananmen Square in 1989.
[00:22:20.603 --> 00:22:23.385]  And Trump's being criticized by the Washington Post.
[00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:26.628]  Xi's choice, destroy Trump or save him and weaken
[00:22:28.323 --> 00:22:37.105]  America, and again, leftists that I know and that others know are being told by other leftists that Communist China is our savior.
[00:22:38.837 --> 00:22:44.420]  That they're the good guys, and that America, and Trump, and the Taiwanese, and the Hong Kongese, they're the bad people.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.942]  So, Savannah, it's midnight out there, or past midnight.
[00:22:48.942 --> 00:22:54.985]  She's there in Hong Kong, other side of the world, by the miracle of the internet, she talks to us now.
[00:22:54.985 --> 00:22:59.467]  Give us your take on what you've seen so far, and what it's like to be somewhere that's already a war zone.
[00:23:02.577 --> 00:23:03.038]  I think so.
[00:23:14.227 --> 00:23:17.608]  Okay, well, hey, Savannah, like I said, the miracle of the other side of the world.
[00:23:17.608 --> 00:23:21.110]  We'll talk to you guys later today, having a technical problem there.
[00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.671]  Can't wait to get them back on later in the broadcast.
[00:23:23.671 --> 00:23:26.632]  But again, these are just live pop-ins on the show.
[00:23:26.632 --> 00:23:37.376]  It's the amazing HD footage they've already shot, the incredible interviews they've already gotten, because I've seen some clips of them, and the fact that they're going to go on that bridge and go right up to where that military's at.
[00:23:37.376 --> 00:23:42.738]  They all volunteered for this, so we're very, very excited that they are all there.
[00:23:42.738 --> 00:23:43.159]  And again,
[00:23:44.119 --> 00:23:58.905]  The massive censorship and things that we see going on over in the Middle East, in Europe and in Communist China is all being cheered on by the corporate media here in this nation.
[00:23:58.905 --> 00:23:59.565]  Think about that.
[00:24:00.464 --> 00:24:06.471]  And think about that invited to the White House a month ago, one of the top memers in the world, Carpe docked him.
[00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:09.075]  That's his handle so he doesn't get harassed by the left.
[00:24:09.075 --> 00:24:10.877]  But they've already doxed him and his family.
[00:24:10.877 --> 00:24:12.299]  They've already threatened his family.
[00:24:12.299 --> 00:24:14.141]  But he keeps moving forward.
[00:24:14.141 --> 00:24:14.501]  So now...
[00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:27.150]  Now they have done a lot of other things, like kick him off Facebook and MemeWorld.com, the new site he was launching, because all the meme sites are getting banned on Facebook, Twitter, you name it.
[00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:31.113]  So he's launching his own system, MemeWorld.com.
[00:24:31.113 --> 00:24:34.175]  It's already getting tweeted out by the White House and a lot of other folks.
[00:24:37.813 --> 00:24:38.854]  Will Trump act?
[00:24:38.854 --> 00:24:42.557]  He says Google should be sued for meddling in the 2016 election.
[00:24:42.557 --> 00:24:43.719]  Top professors have proven it.
[00:24:43.719 --> 00:24:44.880]  The numbers show it.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.840]  But what about now?
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.642]  We're not just meddling in the election.
[00:24:47.642 --> 00:24:51.266]  They're meddling with all the information, fixing all the different results.
[00:24:51.266 --> 00:24:54.789]  I think we've got her back now, audio-wise, from the other side of the planet.
[00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:56.530]  Savannah, let's see if we got you this time.
[00:24:56.530 --> 00:25:00.834]  What's it like there, being in the middle of what's already a war zone?
[00:25:00.834 --> 00:25:01.415]  Hi, Alex.
[00:25:01.415 --> 00:25:02.476]  Can you hear me a little bit better?
[00:25:02.476 --> 00:25:03.177]  I sure can.
[00:25:03.177 --> 00:25:03.477]  Welcome.
[00:25:04.435 --> 00:25:05.816]  All right, perfect, perfect.
[00:25:05.816 --> 00:25:09.138]  So, as I was saying earlier, it's been really, really interesting being here.
[00:25:09.138 --> 00:25:18.382]  As soon as we got off the plane, our cab driver, a lot of locals, they know that we're American Media and they're really happy that, of course, people are coming and bringing light to everything that's going on here.
[00:25:18.382 --> 00:25:24.766]  We talked to you about how this could potentially be another Tenement Square and a lot of people have come forward and tried to tell us their story.
[00:25:24.766 --> 00:25:26.967]  They really want us to get the word out about
[00:25:27.487 --> 00:25:32.111]  Mainland China and how they're trying to impose their rule over here, how they're trying to come in here.
[00:25:32.111 --> 00:25:36.234]  Like you were talking about previously too, we've seen the military amassing at the border.
[00:25:36.234 --> 00:25:38.336]  So we're going to be giving you coverage about that.
[00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:40.918]  And again, we've been hearing a lot about that on the ground here.
[00:25:43.968 --> 00:25:49.430]  Roughly one third of the people, seven and a half million on that island, have already been demonstrating.
[00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.171]  Roughly half don't want to be under China's control.
[00:25:52.171 --> 00:25:58.594]  Imagine what it's like to be them, where they're trying to pass a law where the Chinese government can arrest you, and you can be disappeared to the mainland.
[00:26:01.107 --> 00:26:08.092]  Right, and we've already seen so many reports, Alex, of people who have been kidnapped, who go missing, and they're found in China.
[00:26:08.092 --> 00:26:14.036]  China actually just came forward and said that they were holding a member of the Hong Kong consulate here.
[00:26:14.036 --> 00:26:22.502]  So we are going to be keeping up with that, and again, doing reports exclusively on those kidnappings and people that have been going missing.
[00:26:22.502 --> 00:26:28.346]  Well, I want you guys to be careful why you're there as well, because I've never been to Asia.
[00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:32.957]  And just knowing that the Communist Chinese have killed...
[00:26:35.791 --> 00:26:40.792]  Four times what Hitler did, twice what the Soviet Russians did.
[00:26:40.792 --> 00:26:42.072]  My mom and dad have gone to Germany.
[00:26:42.072 --> 00:26:44.973]  They've stood there at Nuremberg where Hitler stood.
[00:26:44.973 --> 00:26:46.993]  They said you can feel the creepy evilness.
[00:26:46.993 --> 00:26:57.375]  I don't think I'd even want to stand where Hitler stood, but just to be standing next to a billion, 400 million slaves, a hundred plus million killed, where they sell organs, where they have animal-human clones.
[00:26:57.375 --> 00:27:00.215]  I mean, you are really close to the center of hell right now.
[00:27:00.215 --> 00:27:01.775]  Can you feel it, or what's the vibe?
[00:27:01.775 --> 00:27:04.896]  Because I know you're in Hong Kong, and that's a more free marketplace.
[00:27:07.429 --> 00:27:08.509]  Well, definitely, Alex.
[00:27:08.509 --> 00:27:17.652]  Like I said, more than anything, I've noticed that a lot of the people here, they're wanting these protests to be peaceful, and they're very pro-democracy and pro-freedom.
[00:27:17.652 --> 00:27:21.753]  And I think we really feel that spirit from a lot of the protesters and locals here.
[00:27:21.753 --> 00:27:22.874]  So it is a good feeling.
[00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:24.594]  People are in good spirit.
[00:27:24.594 --> 00:27:31.556]  But of course, like you talked about, there is still that threat of mainland China imposing and coming in, being right there on the border.
[00:27:31.556 --> 00:27:34.037]  So that is still something that we are all very aware of.
[00:27:36.172 --> 00:27:38.514]  Well, Savannah, I want you guys to be able to get some sleep.
[00:27:38.514 --> 00:27:39.895]  Talk about jet lag.
[00:27:39.895 --> 00:27:42.998]  But I also want to hear what Gregg Reese has to say.
[00:27:42.998 --> 00:27:51.706]  So when we come back, I'll spend a few minutes with Gregg Reese, and then we're going to get Carpe Dantamon about this new Memeworld.com.
[00:27:51.706 --> 00:27:52.987]  I was already on Memeworld.
[00:27:52.987 --> 00:27:56.070]  I remember he said he was going to build it a few weeks ago, and they're already building it.
[00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:01.452]  Remembered he was coming on today because I heard he got banned yesterday on Facebook.
[00:28:01.452 --> 00:28:02.612]  I went and visited it.
[00:28:02.612 --> 00:28:08.314]  It's just beautiful to see what's happening there and to know that that's banned in Communist China and more and more being banned here.
[00:28:08.314 --> 00:28:14.537]  It just shows how close we are to real tyranny.
[00:28:14.537 --> 00:28:15.837]  Definitely Alex, definitely.
[00:28:15.837 --> 00:28:21.119]  Alright, well we'll talk to Gregory's quickly on the other side of the break and then go to Carpe Donctum.
[00:28:21.119 --> 00:28:23.480]  But if this doesn't make you angry,
[00:28:24.466 --> 00:28:32.873]  This doesn't make you sick to your stomach to see Communist China in the Washington Post as our savior.
[00:28:32.873 --> 00:28:37.737]  And Trump, as the bad guy, says only Xi can save America.
[00:28:37.737 --> 00:28:40.699]  But he's got to destroy Donald Trump to do it.
[00:28:40.699 --> 00:28:43.361]  And now leftists are like, we love you, Xi!
[00:28:43.361 --> 00:28:44.162]  Crush him!
[00:28:44.162 --> 00:28:46.323]  He's the new Robert Mueller.
[00:28:46.323 --> 00:28:47.404]  Oh, Mueller could get him.
[00:28:47.404 --> 00:28:48.745]  China, Xi!
[00:28:48.745 --> 00:28:49.906]  Get him!
[00:28:49.906 --> 00:28:52.168]  He's like, don't worry, I will, dirty Americans!
[00:28:54.406 --> 00:28:58.249]  Stay with us.
[00:28:58.249 --> 00:29:00.210]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:07.115]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:29:07.115 --> 00:29:15.461]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:15.461 --> 00:29:21.145]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:00.372]  Thomas Jefferson predicted
[00:31:01.113 --> 00:31:11.677]  Over 240 years ago, that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[00:31:11.677 --> 00:31:14.578]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[00:31:14.578 --> 00:31:16.339]  farming goods a week ago.
[00:31:16.339 --> 00:31:19.980]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:25.185]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[00:31:25.185 --> 00:31:26.226]  That's beautiful.
[00:31:26.226 --> 00:31:28.127]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[00:31:28.127 --> 00:31:29.729]  And we aren't going to back down.
[00:31:29.729 --> 00:31:37.336]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.

[00:33:01.949 --> 00:33:04.574]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.134 --> 00:33:26.495]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:26.495 --> 00:33:29.517]  We're in a proxy war with Communist China.
[00:33:29.517 --> 00:33:30.677]  China's allied with the globalists.
[00:33:30.677 --> 00:33:33.699]  They have openly bought up the majority of U.S.
[00:33:33.699 --> 00:33:44.185]  Treasuries, the big six Hollywood production houses, studios, and now the Washington Post, today.
[00:33:44.185 --> 00:33:50.669]  Xi's choice, destroy Trump or save him and weaken America.
[00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:53.631]  So, what that really says is, China, destroy Trump to save America.
[00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:56.671]  That's what it says.
[00:33:56.671 --> 00:33:58.571]  That's his choice.
[00:33:58.571 --> 00:34:00.912]  Oh, our savior!
[00:34:00.912 --> 00:34:05.894]  Dick Dastardly's tied the young maiden down on the train track, and then here comes the good guy.
[00:34:05.894 --> 00:34:08.995]  And she's like, oh, Captain Fantastic!
[00:34:08.995 --> 00:34:10.356]  You're so wonderful!
[00:34:10.356 --> 00:34:10.996]  My hero!
[00:34:10.996 --> 00:34:16.438]  And she falls into G's hands, who's a dictator for life.
[00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:22.873]  They estimate, since he's been in power, he's put over 20 million people in death camps.
[00:34:22.873 --> 00:34:26.255]  Many of them executed, their organs sold.
[00:34:26.255 --> 00:34:31.879]  He's put 2 million ethnic Uyghurs, Mongolians, in forced labor camps.
[00:34:31.879 --> 00:34:33.120]  That's all admitted!
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.841]  Oh my gosh!
[00:34:34.841 --> 00:34:39.244]  But Trump, when unvetted people come across the border, he checks them.
[00:34:39.244 --> 00:34:40.544]  I don't want to keep you guys up.
[00:34:40.544 --> 00:34:41.385]  You need to get some sleep.
[00:34:41.385 --> 00:34:42.486]  A lot's coming up tomorrow.
[00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:44.066]  You're ahead of us today.
[00:34:44.066 --> 00:34:47.628]  I guess it's almost the 22nd, or it is there now.
[00:34:47.628 --> 00:34:55.493]  But Greg Reese, a great reporter, great researcher, what's your first take being there now for the last 15 hours or so?
[00:34:55.493 --> 00:35:01.736]  Well, you know, I just heard what you were talking about, about President Trump and the communist Chinese coming to America's aid to help President Trump.
[00:35:01.736 --> 00:35:05.518]  And it's interesting because... To help bring down President Trump.
[00:35:05.518 --> 00:35:07.919]  That's right, to help bring down President Trump, you're right.
[00:35:07.919 --> 00:35:12.562]  And we met a gentleman today and we were talking about things and everything and we asked him what he thought about Trump.
[00:35:13.135 --> 00:35:18.179]  And his first answer was, he said, well, Trump's kind of a little crazy.
[00:35:18.179 --> 00:35:20.600]  And then he smiled and kind of gave us a funny grin.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:26.745]  And then he said, but you know, sometimes when times are crazy, we need a crazy person.
[00:35:26.745 --> 00:35:30.287]  And he's the only guy who's ever held China to task.
[00:35:30.287 --> 00:35:34.230]  And he was very happy with Trump's attitude towards China.
[00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.412]  And I get the feeling that a lot of people here are too.
[00:35:36.412 --> 00:35:38.093]  There's a lot of unification here about that.
[00:35:39.158 --> 00:35:54.468]  Well, I've run into a lot of folks from India and a lot of folks from Hong Kong and they all just love the show because they're all sick of China pushing them around and then our media saying they're bad if they stand up for themselves.
[00:35:54.468 --> 00:35:59.412]  So you have India going into Kashmir, that's always been part of India, that Pakistan and China are trying to take.
[00:35:59.412 --> 00:36:00.852]  They're finally standing up.
[00:36:00.852 --> 00:36:03.234]  You've got folks in Hong Kong, Taiwan saying no.
[00:36:03.234 --> 00:36:05.456]  So I can't wait to see the reports you file, Greg.
[00:36:05.456 --> 00:36:06.937]  They're always so powerful.
[00:36:06.937 --> 00:36:09.018]  What are some of the other angles you're going to be looking at?
[00:36:11.761 --> 00:36:20.913]  Well, we're going to get into a lot of what you were talking about today about the land bridge and the history and in the past of the Tiananmen Square and what we're looking at here today.
[00:36:20.913 --> 00:36:26.620]  And also what I find very interesting is how Savannah was talking about there's a great unity here right now amongst the people and there are.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.101]  But they don't trust their police force anymore, and they used to.
[00:36:31.101 --> 00:36:36.583]  Up until very recently, up until like maybe a month ago, they always felt their police was very fair and non-political.
[00:36:36.583 --> 00:36:48.046]  But everyone seems to be talking now that the local police are working for the Communist Chinese, working in tandem with the local criminal gangs, the triad gangs, and everyone's talking about it.
[00:36:48.046 --> 00:36:52.888]  Unlike in America, where there seems to be a lot of love for communism, there's none of that here.
[00:36:52.888 --> 00:36:56.529]  The East is the New West, and it's a beautiful thing to see.
[00:36:57.392 --> 00:37:04.676]  We also saw a gentleman from India when we were doing a shoot, and he just walked up to us, he saw the camera, and he just kind of introduced himself and asked what we were doing.
[00:37:04.676 --> 00:37:17.964]  And he was from India, and I asked him about what's going on with Kashmir and Trump, and the same thing like you were saying, he's very happy with what Trump's doing, he's very happy with taking the Muslims on in Kashmir, and it's a global thing that's happening.
[00:37:19.244 --> 00:37:19.945]  Absolutely.
[00:37:19.945 --> 00:37:23.627]  The West and the East have all been pushed by Islam.
[00:37:23.627 --> 00:37:30.552]  Islam's only 1,400 years old and it's already taken over half the planet and hundreds of millions are dead and people are done.
[00:37:30.552 --> 00:37:34.835]  They're not going to be pushed around by the Chaikovs or by the Islamists or by the left anymore.
[00:37:34.835 --> 00:37:39.398]  And there's a united front from Brazil to the United States, from Greece to you name it.
[00:37:39.938 --> 00:37:45.462]  And we're going to win, but you've got the big megabanks allied with China and radical Islam, and it is quite a conflagration.
[00:37:45.462 --> 00:37:46.662]  Greg Rees, great job.
[00:37:46.662 --> 00:37:47.903]  You and Drew and Savannah.
[00:37:47.903 --> 00:37:55.088]  Now go get some sleep, and then I can't wait to see you hit the ground running as those articles and videos get posted to newswars.com and infowars.com.
[00:37:55.088 --> 00:37:59.210]  And I know Paul Watson's going to be covering a lot of what you're doing as well over at summit.news.
[00:37:59.210 --> 00:37:59.591]  Thank you, Greg.
[00:38:01.308 --> 00:38:01.768]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:38:20.054 --> 00:38:28.824]  Hundreds of millions of accounts, yes, of meme sites and meme followers have been purged so that we can't communicate with this new modern form of communication.
[00:38:28.824 --> 00:38:30.987]  Beyond the emoji, it is the meme.
[00:38:30.987 --> 00:38:32.148]  It is art.
[00:38:32.148 --> 00:38:37.915]  And so he went up on Facebook with memeworld.com, and within two hours, they had banned it.
[00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:38.816]  And so it reminded me.
[00:38:39.136 --> 00:38:40.996]  Let me go see what's on memeworld.com.
[00:38:40.996 --> 00:38:48.618]  I literally hadn't looked at it since he told me he was building it a few months ago, but did not say anything that he wanted to talk about on the air, you know, once he launched it.
[00:38:48.618 --> 00:38:51.699]  And then, boom, before I even remembered it was being launched, it's being censored.
[00:38:51.699 --> 00:38:53.999]  But you can find it at memeworld.com.
[00:38:53.999 --> 00:38:56.740]  Now, he's gotten together a collection of the best memers.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.921]  You can't say who the best is, but he's right up there.
[00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:00.881]  But something wicked
[00:39:01.241 --> 00:39:02.203]  Another fellow Texan.
[00:39:02.203 --> 00:39:03.486]  I can't wait to meet him.
[00:39:03.486 --> 00:39:05.310]  I know he talks to you all the time.
[00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:07.174]  He put together this latest video.
[00:39:07.174 --> 00:39:08.898]  Trump 2020 ad.
[00:39:08.898 --> 00:39:10.421]  Ford commercial parody.
[00:39:10.421 --> 00:39:10.882]  Here it is.
[00:39:12.418 --> 00:39:17.243]  Okay, odds are you're one of the people in America who's better off today than three years ago.
[00:39:17.243 --> 00:39:24.011]  And now you've got some smug Democrat calling you racist and trying to jam one hand in your ass and another in your pocket.
[00:39:24.011 --> 00:39:32.420]  So at a time when taxes are down, jobs are up, and the economy is way up, it'd be nice if there were a candidate who had more to offer than making you pay for other people.
[00:39:33.241 --> 00:39:35.922]  Well, the eagle has landed.
[00:39:35.922 --> 00:39:38.362]  Say hello to President Donald J. Trump.
[00:39:38.362 --> 00:39:40.583]  He ain't just making America great again.
[00:39:40.583 --> 00:39:43.544]  Trump's doing things no president has ever done before.
[00:39:43.544 --> 00:39:51.446]  He's keeping promises, packing courts, defending the border, rebuilding our military, and making Chuck Schumer cry like a schoolgirl with two skinned knees.
[00:39:51.446 --> 00:39:55.627]  This president is six foot three inches of let's put America first.
[00:39:55.627 --> 00:40:00.268]  And oh yeah, immigration, jobs, drug prices, nobody's got better numbers.
[00:40:01.028 --> 00:40:05.391]  The game has changed, and the Democrats are officially f***ing crazy.
[00:40:05.391 --> 00:40:06.891]  So keep America Great.
[00:40:06.891 --> 00:40:08.152]  Stand with Trump in 2020.
[00:40:08.152 --> 00:40:29.684]  Now we're going to break here in a few minutes, but wow, Carpe D'Antem, before I could even remember that you were planning to launch this, when you just got out of the White House, we were talking on the phone off-air, before I even remembered you were launching this, before I even knew it had been launched, it was already banned on Facebook.
[00:40:29.684 --> 00:40:30.385]  Congratulations.
[00:40:31.906 --> 00:40:32.266]  Thank you.
[00:40:32.266 --> 00:40:35.307]  Yeah, I don't know that it even took two hours.
[00:40:35.307 --> 00:40:43.409]  I was seeing messages almost immediately, like within 10 minutes of it going up, that it was banned on Facebook.
[00:40:43.409 --> 00:40:46.470]  So I don't know if they were preemptively banning it or what's going on.
[00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:52.972]  But as far as I know, you still can't share it in Messenger and you still can't share it on Facebook.
[00:40:52.972 --> 00:40:55.752]  Oh, they're not even letting you share it in the Messenger privately.
[00:40:55.752 --> 00:40:57.333]  So already they've gone China level.
[00:40:57.333 --> 00:40:57.473]  Wow.
[00:40:59.332 --> 00:41:11.401]  Yeah, somebody sent me a screenshot of, uh, they had put spaces between, uh, like the M, the E, the M, the E. They put spaces between everything, and it still wouldn't let them share it in, uh, Messenger.
[00:41:11.401 --> 00:41:14.344]  So, it's pretty insane.
[00:41:14.344 --> 00:41:16.845]  Well, you know you're over the target when you're getting heat like that.
[00:41:16.845 --> 00:41:25.292]  I mean, when we launch new sites, they don't get banned that quick, but I know they fear you, and the site looks great, and they fear this collection of memers you've gotten together.
[00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:34.996]  Apparently they're worried about people being able to share memes and they've already banned them on Facebook for the most part.
[00:41:34.996 --> 00:41:43.283]  A few get by the censors every once in a while, but memes are definitely under attack on Facebook.
[00:41:43.283 --> 00:41:47.266]  They haven't gone full crazy on Twitter yet, but they're getting there.
[00:41:49.747 --> 00:41:51.488]  How long ago was it you were in the White House?
[00:41:51.488 --> 00:41:53.270]  Because, I mean, Trump says he's going to take action.
[00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:54.951]  I keep believing he is.
[00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:57.673]  But we haven't seen it yet.
[00:41:57.673 --> 00:42:00.335]  I was there on July 3rd and July 11th.
[00:42:00.335 --> 00:42:04.578]  So it's a little more than a month ago.
[00:42:04.578 --> 00:42:08.061]  The summit was the 11th.
[00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:10.342]  And I'm not sure when he's going to start taking action.
[00:42:10.342 --> 00:42:18.068]  I'm not sure what action he can take as long as Congress remains unwilling to do anything about it as well.
[00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:23.042]  Well, I know a bunch of heavy hitters are already tweeting memeworld.com.
[00:42:23.042 --> 00:42:24.824]  Did that happen after it was banned on Facebook?
[00:42:24.824 --> 00:42:27.246]  Because maybe that's what alerted the establishment.
[00:42:27.246 --> 00:42:31.910]  Because, I mean, they're even banning Mitch McConnell being able to respond to people at his house.
[00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:33.231]  And I've got articles here now.
[00:42:33.231 --> 00:42:33.732]  Did you hear?
[00:42:33.732 --> 00:42:35.053]  We'll cover it when we come back.
[00:42:35.053 --> 00:42:38.716]  Where Trump put out a thing about strong women.
[00:42:38.716 --> 00:42:41.278]  And they said saying the word woman is hurtful.
[00:42:41.278 --> 00:42:44.201]  So they banned the ad?
[00:42:44.201 --> 00:42:45.041]  It's very hurtful.
[00:42:45.041 --> 00:42:46.022]  I have to agree.
[00:42:46.022 --> 00:42:46.523]  Very hurtful.
[00:42:47.577 --> 00:42:48.880]  We're not in a cult or anything.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.084]  These people aren't scary or anything.
[00:42:51.084 --> 00:42:53.950]  I'm trying to rip off Tucker Carlson.
[00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:55.212]  I think these people are nuts.
[00:42:55.212 --> 00:42:56.755]  You better ride back, stay with us.
[00:42:58.444 --> 00:43:00.465]  Robert Moritz, what has Big Tech become?
[00:43:00.465 --> 00:43:08.968]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies, and the way they did so is because they faced no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[00:43:08.968 --> 00:43:21.054]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[00:43:21.054 --> 00:43:24.135]  Otherwise, they will never change, and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs
[00:43:24.295 --> 00:43:26.256]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[00:43:54.232 --> 00:43:56.153]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[00:43:56.153 --> 00:43:58.954]  Even it is what you just saw.
[00:43:58.954 --> 00:44:15.619]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[00:44:15.619 --> 00:44:19.721]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down.
[00:44:19.721 --> 00:44:23.042]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements, because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[00:44:23.402 --> 00:44:25.143]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[00:44:25.143 --> 00:44:28.044]  Jones sells unapproved supplements.
[00:44:28.044 --> 00:44:29.385]  And he claims they're supplements.
[00:44:29.385 --> 00:44:37.328]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[00:44:37.328 --> 00:44:40.050]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:44.952]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[00:44:44.952 --> 00:44:46.133]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[00:44:46.133 --> 00:44:46.953]  They have side effects.
[00:44:47.113 --> 00:44:51.721]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:53.604]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:59.042 --> 00:45:12.235]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[00:45:12.235 --> 00:45:15.158]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[00:45:15.158 --> 00:45:16.900]  farming goods a week ago.
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.563]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[00:45:21.184 --> 00:45:25.745]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[00:45:25.745 --> 00:45:26.785]  That's beautiful.
[00:45:26.785 --> 00:45:28.686]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[00:45:28.686 --> 00:45:30.286]  And we aren't going to back down.
[00:45:30.286 --> 00:45:37.888]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[00:45:37.888 --> 00:45:40.209]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[00:45:40.209 --> 00:45:44.370]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:45.310]  And I'm asking listeners,
[00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:50.219]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[00:45:50.219 --> 00:45:51.321]  We are the resistance.
[00:45:51.321 --> 00:45:51.962]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[00:45:59.491 --> 00:46:01.932]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[00:46:01.932 --> 00:46:05.393]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[00:46:05.393 --> 00:46:06.933]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[00:46:06.933 --> 00:46:08.253]  I want to take the gloveless on.
[00:46:08.253 --> 00:46:10.214]  Total transparency's our whole operation.
[00:46:10.214 --> 00:46:15.395]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's to cost the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[00:46:15.395 --> 00:46:18.216]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[00:46:18.356 --> 00:46:19.056]  We got coffee.
[00:46:19.056 --> 00:46:19.937]  We got fish oil.
[00:46:19.937 --> 00:46:20.737]  We got turmeric.
[00:46:20.737 --> 00:46:21.718]  We got great toothpaste.
[00:46:21.718 --> 00:46:24.099]  We've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[00:46:24.099 --> 00:46:26.760]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.362]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[00:46:29.362 --> 00:46:30.863]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[00:46:30.863 --> 00:46:33.224]  And it is the strongest, purest krill oil.
[00:46:33.224 --> 00:46:35.065]  And it cost us three times more.
[00:46:35.305 --> 00:46:39.986]  Because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[00:46:39.986 --> 00:46:45.787]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[00:46:45.787 --> 00:46:48.048]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[00:46:48.048 --> 00:46:48.968]  This has not been.
[00:46:48.968 --> 00:46:53.589]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:55.209]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[00:46:55.209 --> 00:46:56.769]  It's not yellow, it's not milky.
[00:46:56.769 --> 00:47:01.430]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:04.031]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:31.917 --> 00:47:35.420]  Here's the latest Carpe D'Ansem trailer for MemeWorld.com.
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.662]  We're not going to play the whole thing.
[00:47:36.662 --> 00:47:39.124]  We played it at the start, but here's just a flavor of it.
[00:47:39.124 --> 00:47:39.784]  It's very well done.
[00:47:39.784 --> 00:47:49.614]  I just came outside to try to process all this.
[00:47:51.178 --> 00:47:56.124]  I want you to create the best memes the world has ever seen.
[00:47:56.124 --> 00:48:04.694]  With your help, we are going to make America great again.
[00:48:04.694 --> 00:48:06.717]  Gangnam Style!
[00:48:12.074 --> 00:48:12.675]  We're good.
[00:48:28.055 --> 00:48:41.890]  And the best part is when Hillary and all the other Democrat candidates for president, the female ones, are cheerleaders!
[00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:43.111]  More of that coming up in a moment.
[00:48:43.111 --> 00:48:45.293]  It's good for radio, but you really need to see it.
[00:48:45.894 --> 00:48:48.816]  Obviously it's at memeworld.com.
[00:48:48.816 --> 00:48:49.716]  Wow.
[00:48:49.716 --> 00:48:52.838]  So tell us about the plans for memeworld.com.
[00:48:52.838 --> 00:48:54.899]  It's got the establishment so scared.
[00:48:54.899 --> 00:48:55.880]  We still have websites.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:59.282]  We're outside the electronic gulag that Matt Dredge warned us of.
[00:48:59.282 --> 00:49:04.645]  And people can still, obviously, go into cyberspace and tell people word of mouth about it.
[00:49:04.645 --> 00:49:09.668]  But the fact that Facebook, you just dropped the bombshell, isn't letting you instant message it.
[00:49:09.668 --> 00:49:13.991]  CNN just two months ago said, well, Jones has been banned completely from Facebook.
[00:49:14.632 --> 00:49:23.993]  And from Instagram, saying his name or saying InfoWars.com in a positive light, but how do we stop him from using instant messages?
[00:49:25.188 --> 00:49:26.029]  Like WhatsApp.
[00:49:26.029 --> 00:49:27.671]  So that's the new frontier.
[00:49:27.671 --> 00:49:40.103]  Imagine if you told somebody two years ago, oh, big tech that buys up instant message companies, they won't let you say somebody's name or send them a news URL because they've got AI watching you.
[00:49:40.103 --> 00:49:46.290]  And they admitted last week, real people are watching in live time as well and coming in and watching what you do.
[00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:48.352]  I mean, there's the whole spying element as well.
[00:49:49.525 --> 00:49:50.165]  Right.
[00:49:50.165 --> 00:49:55.309]  Oh, and I think that's what they promised that they wouldn't do when they bottled this stuff.
[00:49:55.309 --> 00:50:05.155]  But I'm going to alert you to something new, is I can't share the Meme World link on Twitter either.
[00:50:05.155 --> 00:50:11.400]  Unless I remove the little preview, it won't let me share a link to Meme World.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.942]  You can only share just the memeworld.com
[00:50:16.115 --> 00:50:23.161]  But if you try to have it have the preview, which a lot of people use to click on, it won't let you share it.
[00:50:23.161 --> 00:50:25.482]  It'll just send it to your drafts and won't let you send the message.
[00:50:25.482 --> 00:50:26.423]  That's on Twitter now.
[00:50:26.423 --> 00:50:27.444]  Wow.
[00:50:27.444 --> 00:50:30.286]  I thought that was just a bug last night, but it's still going on.
[00:50:30.286 --> 00:50:31.167]  Well, think about this.
[00:50:31.167 --> 00:50:39.253]  The EU says that they've passed laws to try to regulate and tax and ban free flow of memes.
[00:50:39.253 --> 00:50:40.814]  And we know that big tech is working in
[00:50:41.966 --> 00:50:46.649]  Consultation and coordination to ban and censor certain things.
[00:50:46.649 --> 00:50:50.051]  So out of the gates, my friend, you meet with the president.
[00:50:50.051 --> 00:50:51.912]  He likes to tweet your memes.
[00:50:51.912 --> 00:50:57.856]  You try to get a consortium of people together where at least you have your own site to post.
[00:50:57.856 --> 00:51:03.919]  Because what really triggered you in the last few months to start building this?
[00:51:03.919 --> 00:51:05.500]  I mean, I remember that conversation.
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.543]  Was it the fact that the Donald had just been frozen and you weren't sure it would ever be unfrozen?
[00:51:10.373 --> 00:51:20.137]  Well, it was multiple reasons, but yeah, the Donald was, they were quarantined and they're still, they remain quarantined now.
[00:51:20.137 --> 00:51:31.902]  They were quarantined and that basically means that no one can get to the site unless you type in the exact URL, you can't get to that community.
[00:51:31.902 --> 00:51:38.625]  That was one reason and the other reason is just that we're continuing to see censorship ramp up and
[00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:48.150]  When I look towards 2020, I am imagining social media only tightening down more than they already have.
[00:51:48.150 --> 00:52:00.559]  And my goal was to create a website where meme creators like myself would have a place to post their videos, their images, and things like that.
[00:52:01.359 --> 00:52:04.440]  Even if social media takes them down.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:15.984]  I mean if YouTube blocks them, they could go to BitChute or another provider and still share the links and those links would then be shared on social media as well.
[00:52:15.984 --> 00:52:23.387]  So I wanted to create a place where silenced people could still post their content.
[00:52:23.387 --> 00:52:25.068]  And boy, couldn't have been a
[00:52:26.815 --> 00:52:29.557]  Day later, I mean, they are moving against everybody.
[00:52:29.557 --> 00:52:36.301]  Hundreds of millions of followers, as you know, on Instagram and Twitter a month ago just deleted from not being able to follow those sites.
[00:52:36.301 --> 00:52:43.166]  Some of them had 43 million followers, 36 million followers, altogether over 200 million followers just gone.
[00:52:43.166 --> 00:52:48.749]  And they're even destroying mainline meme sites that have any type of pro-America stuff.
[00:52:48.749 --> 00:52:50.971]  I mean, this is scorched earth.
[00:52:50.971 --> 00:52:55.094]  Well, and you know, what is what is so ironic is that
[00:52:56.599 --> 00:53:05.026]  You know, Snopes, Snopes is used by social media as a, you know, trusted source.
[00:53:05.026 --> 00:53:13.213]  And just this week, they spent like two days debunking Babylon Bee satire site.
[00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:39.762]  Content so if you have if you have a site like that that is a trusted source For social media and they decide what can and can't be on social media It's just a matter of time before they start fact-checking memes I mean CNN and MSNBC and all of those have already fact-checked my videos before that No, Joe Biden didn't actually grope himself in a video but
[00:53:41.448 --> 00:53:42.870]  I mean, that's where we're going.
[00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:50.719]  We're going to a place where if you post a meme, it's now fake news, you're trying to mislead.
[00:53:50.719 --> 00:53:56.626]  Oh yeah, Snopes is starting to fact check mainline comedians, and the comedians come out and say, how do you fact check a joke?
[00:53:58.618 --> 00:54:00.478]  I mean, they're at war with reality.
[00:54:00.478 --> 00:54:01.939]  I mentioned this and it's here in my stack.
[00:54:01.939 --> 00:54:03.259]  I'll put it back on screen.
[00:54:03.259 --> 00:54:08.840]  Did you see where they just banned the Republican National Committee's ad because it said, we're looking for strong women?
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:13.721]  And they said, well, someone that got that might not be a woman, and hearing the word woman might trigger them.
[00:54:13.721 --> 00:54:17.742]  This is a war on language by design.
[00:54:17.742 --> 00:54:23.643]  That might be the most insane thing I've ever heard, that someone might not be a woman, and so they might be offended.
[00:54:27.121 --> 00:54:32.057]  If you're that person that's offended by hearing the word woman, I don't know where to even begin with you.
[00:54:33.359 --> 00:54:36.481]  Well, I remember seeing this five years ago and now it's taught in schools everywhere.
[00:54:36.481 --> 00:54:38.123]  They put it on the entrance forms.
[00:54:38.123 --> 00:54:44.047]  Do not say you're a mother or father on the entrance exam because someone might not have a mother and father.
[00:54:44.047 --> 00:54:45.828]  And so that's misgendering.
[00:54:45.828 --> 00:54:50.352]  So if you send someone an image saying we're looking for strong women, let's put that back on screen.
[00:54:50.352 --> 00:54:52.753]  This is banned by Facebook.
[00:54:52.753 --> 00:54:54.435]  Facebook stands by it.
[00:54:54.435 --> 00:54:56.997]  The Women for Trump coalition needs the support.
[00:54:57.817 --> 00:55:01.698]  Of strong women like you, add your name.
[00:55:01.698 --> 00:55:14.462]  So if women want to give their email to Trump and this women's coalition, and he's got this big agenda to put women in executive positions, if you want to be part of that, this is hateful and that's not kosher either.
[00:55:14.462 --> 00:55:17.223]  I mean, if Trump doesn't act now, will he ever act?
[00:55:17.223 --> 00:55:19.404]  He says he's getting ready to, he's got to act now.
[00:55:20.259 --> 00:55:31.266]  You know, it would be a shame if someone were to go back and clip out all the times that Democrats said we need strong women to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[00:55:31.266 --> 00:55:33.228]  That would be a total shame, don't you think?
[00:55:33.228 --> 00:55:36.410]  I'm imagining someone's going to do that.
[00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:37.331]  That might happen.
[00:55:37.331 --> 00:55:37.651]  I don't know.
[00:55:37.651 --> 00:55:37.951]  We'll see.
[00:55:41.021 --> 00:55:46.264]  Placebong or Pong, pieces like strong woman, strong woman, strong woman, and then meanwhile show this.
[00:55:46.264 --> 00:55:53.549]  Now the truth is anything effective, real communication is being jammed with political correctness and it's gone to the next level.
[00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:56.071]  Well tell us more about memeworld.com.
[00:55:56.071 --> 00:55:57.872]  How do people become a part of it or how does it work?
[00:56:00.497 --> 00:56:09.823]  Right now I've just got kind of the core of people that have been friends of mine for a long time, but I'm looking to add as many creators as I can.
[00:56:09.823 --> 00:56:19.770]  I'm obviously looking for quality content and people that are going to produce on a regular basis, but really I'm looking for anybody.
[00:56:21.181 --> 00:56:23.122]  You could be somebody that's unknown.
[00:56:23.122 --> 00:56:24.782]  You could be somebody that's well-known.
[00:56:24.782 --> 00:56:26.083]  All you have to do is contact me.
[00:56:26.083 --> 00:56:34.406]  You can contact me at CarpeDomptom on Twitter, or if you'd like to email me, you can email me at carpedomptom at memeworld.com.
[00:56:36.488 --> 00:56:44.330]  We'll be adding people, like the trailer video said, we'll be adding people weekly, monthly, daily, hourly, secondly.
[00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:51.112]  Whenever we get people that have quality content that want to post on the site, then we'll add them on.
[00:56:51.112 --> 00:56:53.793]  Right now there is discussion.
[00:56:53.793 --> 00:57:00.675]  You can talk in the comments and things like that, but it's not open for just anyone to post.
[00:57:00.675 --> 00:57:05.156]  And that's for obvious reasons, because they're going to send in some of the Harvey Law Center people posing as us saying,
[00:57:06.883 --> 00:57:14.991]  Yeah, I'm going to try to avoid having just random trolls posting Hitler and Nazi salutes and all that kind of stuff.
[00:57:14.991 --> 00:57:19.896]  Well, you know what it'll be, they'll have an enemy for a guy, you know, go in there and say something before he goes and shoots up a school.
[00:57:19.896 --> 00:57:21.878]  I mean, we know all their tricks.
[00:57:21.878 --> 00:57:29.586]  Yeah, that would be the first thing that they would do, would be try to make it look like I'm trying to promote that stuff, which I obviously am not.
[00:57:30.498 --> 00:57:32.959]  Well, I'm really excited to do five more minutes with you, my friend.
[00:57:32.959 --> 00:57:35.661]  Carpe Donctum is his handle.
[00:57:35.661 --> 00:57:37.442]  Secret Agent of America.
[00:57:37.442 --> 00:57:43.665]  And there's a lot going on, ladies and gentlemen, that's going to be emerging very soon as well.
[00:57:43.665 --> 00:57:50.648]  But obviously, the eye of Sauron is watching closely.
[00:57:50.648 --> 00:57:54.110]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:58.132]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:57:58.132 --> 00:57:59.132]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:58:02.276 --> 00:58:06.837]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[00:58:06.837 --> 00:58:09.898]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[00:58:09.898 --> 00:58:11.039]  It's a form of fascism.
[00:58:11.039 --> 00:58:15.740]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:27.044]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:58:27.044 --> 00:58:30.485]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[00:58:38.667 --> 00:58:42.608]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:58:42.608 --> 00:58:44.608]  You can't watch this, the movie.
[00:58:44.608 --> 00:58:49.009]  Available now at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:58:49.009 --> 00:58:53.190]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:54.251]  They are technocrats.
[00:58:54.251 --> 00:58:56.531]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:58:56.531 --> 00:59:03.893]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:59:03.893 --> 00:59:05.773]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:59:05.773 --> 00:59:07.854]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:59:08.374 --> 00:59:14.719]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:59:14.719 --> 00:59:19.923]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warsandlife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:59:19.923 --> 00:59:28.929]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:35.893]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[00:59:35.893 --> 00:59:36.834]  It is amazing.
[00:59:36.834 --> 00:59:46.899]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:46.899 --> 00:59:48.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.075 --> 01:00:23.247]  You know, I never studied psychology in depth when I was first starting my broadcast off.
[01:00:23.247 --> 01:00:24.667]  I just innately loved Americana.
[01:00:24.667 --> 01:00:27.089]  I was born and bred in it.
[01:00:27.089 --> 01:00:29.451]  And going to college and stuff, I saw how anti-American it was.
[01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:35.581]  Now, anti-white it was, trying to create race war, that I had to get politically involved.
[01:00:35.581 --> 01:00:47.544]  But I've got all these hundreds of news stories, literally hundreds of news stories, incredible guests, but I can't get over the Republican National Committee, an ad saying, we're forming a coalition of strong women.
[01:00:47.544 --> 01:00:55.405]  And Trump's actually creating conduits into corporations to put women in charge of major things, stuff the Democrats talk about but don't ever do.
[01:00:55.405 --> 01:00:58.966]  And the Democrats say, you're not allowed to put that out, it misgendered.
[01:01:00.828 --> 01:01:04.941]  Someone might have seen the word woman who wasn't a woman and that's like an n-word.
[01:01:06.308 --> 01:01:07.508]  That's beyond 1984.
[01:01:07.508 --> 01:01:08.709]  That's beyond anything I've ever heard of.
[01:01:08.709 --> 01:01:15.490]  So, I've got a thousand topics here to cover, but this... Next they're going to say, the color pink, that belongs to Democrats.
[01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:17.931]  So you just said it, Carpe Donctum.
[01:01:17.931 --> 01:01:19.391]  They've got to lose.
[01:01:19.391 --> 01:01:26.853]  They've got to be stood up to, because these people really are the closest thing to Mao Zedong or Hitler I've ever seen.
[01:01:26.853 --> 01:01:30.954]  I mean, this is next level what Facebook and Twitter and all them are doing.
[01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:40.345]  I mean, I know Trump's letting them go on for a long time so that when we finally drop the hammer on them, it's very obvious to everybody.
[01:01:40.345 --> 01:01:41.527]  But I don't think we can wait that long.
[01:01:41.527 --> 01:01:45.232]  And I think a lot of folks are scared of big tech and are rolling over to it.
[01:01:45.232 --> 01:01:48.076]  I mean, I think this is one of Trump's biggest failures.
[01:01:48.076 --> 01:01:49.097]  And I'll go further than that.
[01:01:49.858 --> 01:01:53.421]  He did come out and say, OK, we're not going to do the expanded background checks now.
[01:01:53.421 --> 01:01:54.221]  I was wrong.
[01:01:54.221 --> 01:01:55.342]  Wouldn't have helped anybody.
[01:01:55.342 --> 01:01:56.643]  Well, he was playing politics there.
[01:01:56.643 --> 01:01:58.144]  I know the inside baseball.
[01:01:58.144 --> 01:02:02.907]  I've talked to people that have been in meetings with him where he tells them, don't worry, I'm going to do it at first.
[01:02:02.907 --> 01:02:04.408]  That'll take the heat off.
[01:02:04.408 --> 01:02:07.310]  And then we'll do nothing because we know it won't work.
[01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:08.010]  And he did it again.
[01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:10.952]  And I told people, people thought, Alex, you're letting him get the guns.
[01:02:10.952 --> 01:02:12.994]  And I said, no, no, no.
[01:02:12.994 --> 01:02:13.934]  He's he's playing them.
[01:02:13.934 --> 01:02:17.977]  But still, it's a dangerous game.
[01:02:17.977 --> 01:02:18.237]  It is.
[01:02:19.878 --> 01:02:42.170]  I really think that as much as I support him and as much as I like to make videos about him, I do think that it's very important for him to get on this issue and make a very strong stand on it because I don't think that he is going to be able to do what he needs to do for 2020 if
[01:02:45.285 --> 01:02:50.990]  Everyone's hands are tied behind their backs, all of the people that are trying to support him.
[01:02:50.990 --> 01:03:08.464]  Obviously, you know just how many people have been already removed from the platform, yourself included, and they're only going to continue to add to that list meme creators and more personalities.
[01:03:08.464 --> 01:03:14.208]  The large social media followings of these people are already being cut down.
[01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:24.295]  Something that doesn't get talked about enough, I think, is all of the mid-level accounts that get scrubbed.
[01:03:24.295 --> 01:03:29.877]  The 5,000 to 20,000 follower accounts that just disappear on a daily basis.
[01:03:29.877 --> 01:03:32.598]  Those are the ones that actually spread the message.
[01:03:32.598 --> 01:03:38.761]  You have these very large creators and they spread messages, but it's all built off the backs of these
[01:03:39.561 --> 01:03:47.604]  Mid-level accounts that are so frequently retweeting and reading the content of these big guys.
[01:03:47.604 --> 01:03:55.187]  And that is how they are really destroying the message, is to attack the people that are actually the message carriers.
[01:03:55.407 --> 01:03:56.928]  That's right, and let's go further.
[01:03:56.928 --> 01:04:06.055]  We take the great things Trump says and the great things that happen, and we take the Democrats lying and cheating and flip-flopping, and we put it together to show people in a very compelling way.
[01:04:06.055 --> 01:04:06.975]  And they can't beat us.
[01:04:06.975 --> 01:04:08.717]  The big corporate guys can't beat us.
[01:04:08.717 --> 01:04:10.778]  They're getting paid $10 million for an ad.
[01:04:10.778 --> 01:04:14.341]  You're just putting together, you know, while you take care of your baby and your wife's at work.
[01:04:14.341 --> 01:04:19.985]  And they don't know how to counter that, so they just don't want to put your race car on the racetrack because you keep beating them.
[01:04:19.985 --> 01:04:20.125]  Right.
[01:04:21.986 --> 01:04:23.907]  Trump's like, well, I can still blast through all this.
[01:04:23.907 --> 01:04:24.427]  No.
[01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:26.488]  They're bullying Trump supporters everywhere.
[01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:31.489]  People need to go out and see the memes and meet other people online and know that we're not alone.
[01:04:31.489 --> 01:04:34.190]  That we're giving aid and comfort to Trump supporters.
[01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:36.271]  The globalists see that as treason.
[01:04:36.271 --> 01:04:40.813]  I want to come back and do five more minutes with you after this quick break with Carpe D'Anthem.
[01:04:40.813 --> 01:04:44.014]  He just launched MemeWorld.com, I guess the last week or so.
[01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:47.096]  It's already banned on Facebook, but you can share it.
[01:04:47.096 --> 01:04:50.358]  For now, I guess on instant message or via word of mouth.
[01:04:50.358 --> 01:04:51.618]  Memeworld.com.
[01:04:51.618 --> 01:04:53.019]  Memeworld.com.
[01:04:53.019 --> 01:04:54.180]  Memeworld.com.
[01:04:57.717 --> 01:05:07.068]  An InfoWarrior fan favorite formula, Survival Shield X2, continues to lead the way into the next generation of super high quality nasoniodine formulas.
[01:05:07.068 --> 01:05:14.878]  Derived from ancient sea salts found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface, every drop of Survival Shield X2 contains 650 micrograms
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.981]  to keep you in your prime form.
[01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:31.626]  Even today, iodine deficiency remains a serious problem, with the World Health Organization estimating that nearly 50 million people still suffer from some kind of mental impairment related to iodine deficiency.
[01:05:31.626 --> 01:05:46.051]  That's why it's so important that you try Survival Shield X2, the only source of 99.999% ultra-pure deep-earth iodine crystals exclusively available through InfoWars Life at an extremely affordable price.
[01:05:46.571 --> 01:05:53.977]  Discover the shocking facts behind nasaniodine and secure your bottle today while supplies last at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:53.977 --> 01:06:03.205]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:13.423 --> 01:06:18.866]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:18.866 --> 01:06:22.488]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[01:06:22.488 --> 01:06:24.309]  to 3 p.m., I'm here live.
[01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:25.210]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:26.831]  But don't forget, David Knight.
[01:06:26.831 --> 01:06:33.654]  The David Knight Show is hard-hitting, focused, incredibly researched, cerebral, but also very fast-moving.
[01:06:33.654 --> 01:06:33.995]  8 a.m.
[01:06:33.995 --> 01:06:34.735]  to 11 a.m.
[01:06:34.735 --> 01:06:36.296]  Then, Owen Schroyer.
[01:06:37.085 --> 01:06:42.067]  And the War Room is fast-paced, hard-hitting, pure Americana.
[01:06:42.067 --> 01:06:51.772]  And I will announce, in the next five or six days, two new shows launching that we'll be carrying.
[01:06:51.772 --> 01:06:56.194]  So get ready for that and so much more.
[01:06:56.194 --> 01:06:59.035]  Now I've got Carpe D'Antem here with me, one of the top meme makers in the world.
[01:06:59.035 --> 01:07:02.317]  Just met with the President extensively on a lot of important things.
[01:07:04.056 --> 01:07:09.599]  We have Mitch McConnell with people at his house saying, we're going to stab you, we're going to kill you.
[01:07:09.599 --> 01:07:15.862]  He puts out on his official campaign site, this is wrong and the Democrats should decry this.
[01:07:15.862 --> 01:07:22.045]  Facebook and Twitter leave it up and freeze his accounts and stand by it.
[01:07:22.045 --> 01:07:24.226]  Stand by it.
[01:07:24.226 --> 01:07:30.049]  Now, again, I've got hundreds of articles here, but I'm gonna go back to this and I'm going to ask listeners and viewers.
[01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:33.531]  How angry does it make you that the Republican National Committee
[01:07:34.565 --> 01:07:43.027]  Put out an ad saying, the Woman for Trump Coalition needs the support of strong women like you.
[01:07:43.027 --> 01:07:48.388]  Add your name.
[01:07:48.388 --> 01:07:53.970]  And all it is, is a bunch of happy women cheering.
[01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:56.991]  And they said, you have misgendered.
[01:07:56.991 --> 01:07:58.551]  You are not allowed to do that.
[01:07:59.927 --> 01:08:01.308]  This is on Infowars.com.
[01:08:01.308 --> 01:08:05.289]  Facebook bans Trump ad for assuming gender identity.
[01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:11.012]  Even though it turns out the ad actually targeted women.
[01:08:11.012 --> 01:08:12.832]  But that doesn't matter.
[01:08:12.832 --> 01:08:14.493]  It targeted female accounts.
[01:08:14.493 --> 01:08:15.814]  The ad was bought fair and square.
[01:08:15.814 --> 01:08:18.615]  But just saying that, oh, you're a woman.
[01:08:18.615 --> 01:08:24.877]  Well, California passed a law that if you misgender somebody, you can go to jail.
[01:08:24.877 --> 01:08:25.638]  For what is it?
[01:08:25.638 --> 01:08:26.798]  Two weeks?
[01:08:26.798 --> 01:08:27.959]  Thousand dollar fine?
[01:08:27.959 --> 01:08:28.819]  But let's pull back here.
[01:08:30.503 --> 01:08:32.164]  Let's pull back here.
[01:08:32.164 --> 01:08:33.344]  You think, okay, that's cute.
[01:08:33.344 --> 01:08:35.625]  Let's just play along with some guy with an axe.
[01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:37.146]  Comes in and attacks people.
[01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:38.227]  Other people get life in prison.
[01:08:38.227 --> 01:08:42.909]  He gets six years because somebody might have misgendered him.
[01:08:42.909 --> 01:08:44.890]  Think about how they're attacking the alphabet.
[01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:46.531]  They're attacking language.
[01:08:46.531 --> 01:08:53.894]  Saying, oh, you can't hit a list of women on Facebook because maybe somebody's going to be offended that they saw an ad for a woman.
[01:08:53.894 --> 01:08:55.195]  That's like opening the newspaper.
[01:08:57.321 --> 01:09:04.646]  And you see an ad for women's bras, you know, when I was like six years old, I was like, I don't know what it is, but I like it.
[01:09:04.646 --> 01:09:07.288]  Below the National Geographic.
[01:09:07.288 --> 01:09:09.769]  The point is, oh my gosh, I'm offended.
[01:09:09.769 --> 01:09:15.433]  I saw a woman's ad for say, women's tennis shoes.
[01:09:15.433 --> 01:09:17.474]  But that's how mentally ill the left is.
[01:09:17.474 --> 01:09:18.675]  But it's by design.
[01:09:18.675 --> 01:09:20.997]  They're projecting this on everybody.
[01:09:20.997 --> 01:09:26.981]  Where anything they want, they can then see the racism or the sexism, and then they can selectively take it down.
[01:09:28.462 --> 01:09:34.607]  If Hillary wants to make black jokes, and say blacks all look alike, everybody giggles because she's anointed.
[01:09:34.607 --> 01:09:35.988]  If you do, you lose your job.
[01:09:35.988 --> 01:09:38.290]  Which, I don't think blacks all look alike.
[01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:40.372]  The point is, it doesn't matter.
[01:09:40.372 --> 01:09:42.454]  Some black guys look alike, some white guys look alike.
[01:09:42.454 --> 01:09:45.056]  It doesn't matter.
[01:09:45.056 --> 01:09:53.824]  The point is, is that this is projecting all of this to sabotage culture, and they want full control of culture, and so Carpe Donctum has reached
[01:09:55.546 --> 01:09:58.772]  Conservatively, with just one of his videos, 100 billion people.
[01:09:58.772 --> 01:10:00.515]  He's probably reached a billion people.
[01:10:00.515 --> 01:10:03.941]  A lot of them over and over again, but a billion or more.
[01:10:03.941 --> 01:10:08.729]  I mean, I know when they banned us on YouTube, on our own five channels, we had five billion views.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.701]  So that's 5 billion times people watched our information.
[01:10:12.701 --> 01:10:15.981]  And it's up there in the databanks, even though we've been purged off those platforms.
[01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:22.223]  But the magnitude now of it, 1999, you'd never imagine this.
[01:10:22.223 --> 01:10:30.525]  Even in a science fiction book about a dystopia, you'd say, oh, they'll never have a dystopia where you can't send out an email or a text message or something saying, strong women.
[01:10:31.869 --> 01:10:33.130]  Because someone might have seen it!
[01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:34.091]  Someone might have been hurt!
[01:10:34.091 --> 01:10:35.492]  This is such next level!
[01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:38.995]  And we're just here taking it like it's, oh, that's just the next level!
[01:10:38.995 --> 01:10:40.436]  And that's how tyranny works.
[01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:49.803]  They incrementally get you to take more and more and more of the poison until you just finally have just succumbed to the insanity.
[01:10:49.803 --> 01:10:51.865]  So there's a total method to this madness.
[01:10:51.865 --> 01:10:54.186]  What do you say, Carpe D'Antem?
[01:10:54.186 --> 01:10:55.648]  Well, what I was going to say was,
[01:10:57.450 --> 01:11:03.855]  Isn't it 1984 that says the revolution will be over when the language is perfect?
[01:11:03.855 --> 01:11:07.178]  And isn't that just exactly what the left tries to do?
[01:11:07.178 --> 01:11:17.046]  They try to police language and make the wrong think go away so that they can create this society where no one is offended.
[01:11:17.046 --> 01:11:21.170]  And when they do that, they also remove all meaning from everything.
[01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:30.692]  That being said, I do have, before we run out of time, I have some homework for you.
[01:11:30.692 --> 01:11:53.207]  If you would like to join in the meme war, I need you to go in front of a green screen for about five minutes and do some spin-arounds and do some RRRRRR and stuff like that and do a bunch of things like that and then send me the video so that I can just easily put that into lots of clips.
[01:11:54.119 --> 01:11:57.482]  Oh, like the famous fidget spinner thing?
[01:11:57.482 --> 01:11:58.643]  Well, just anything.
[01:11:58.643 --> 01:12:03.206]  Just be Alex Jones for five minutes.
[01:12:03.206 --> 01:12:08.991]  Five minutes of Alex Jones in front of a green screen would be a meme maker's dream.
[01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:11.193]  Listen, you write it up.
[01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:12.034]  You've got my phone number.
[01:12:12.034 --> 01:12:14.295]  Text me my orders, oh great one.
[01:12:14.295 --> 01:12:18.559]  And whatever you want, you will have it post-haste.
[01:12:18.559 --> 01:12:19.580]  But let me expand on that.
[01:12:20.899 --> 01:12:22.600]  You're right about 1984.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:41.176]  George Orwell was a lead propagandist in the Office of Strategic Plans, or Strategic Services, and he wrote in 1984, I know because he wrote essays before he died, he died a year after the book was published, that he was both O'Brien and Winston, because he'd done both things.
[01:12:42.014 --> 01:12:42.976]  I mean, he's an incredible guy.
[01:12:42.976 --> 01:12:46.642]  He was an imperial secret police in India, tortured, killed people, everything.
[01:12:46.642 --> 01:12:50.508]  He then, you know, fought for the communists against Hitler in the Spanish Civil War.
[01:12:50.508 --> 01:12:52.632]  He was a major propagandist.
[01:12:54.042 --> 01:12:59.325]  And then he learned the communists were just as bad as the fascists and just wanted to dominate people and were just a satanic cult.
[01:12:59.325 --> 01:13:03.888]  So that book is really a confession of where England was going, the end of the family, all this.
[01:13:03.888 --> 01:13:15.254]  And they said they wanted to finally reduce language down to grunts so that no one could ever communicate and understand complexities that up and down and down is up and that they were being lied to.
[01:13:15.254 --> 01:13:18.676]  And so, yes, so you wonder, why is it like 1984?
[01:13:18.676 --> 01:13:23.219]  Hillary said her favorite book is 1984 because for her it's an instruction manual.
[01:13:24.271 --> 01:13:26.533]  Right, exactly.
[01:13:26.533 --> 01:13:37.020]  And, you know, what our media and what the left wants to do right now is to remove all context from anything.
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:47.427]  There's tons and tons of nuance to everything that someone on the left does, and there's absolutely no allowance for nuance on the right.
[01:13:47.427 --> 01:13:48.708]  Take you, for example.
[01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:53.511]  Anything that you say can only be interpreted in a negative way
[01:13:54.443 --> 01:13:56.323]  To the most extreme.
[01:13:56.323 --> 01:14:20.148]  And the way that they do that is just, they combine words, they conflate ideas, they'll put one group of people into this giant category, and then lump all of these evils and wrongs into that category, so that every time that you speak, no one has to even listen to you, because they know what you are.
[01:14:20.148 --> 01:14:22.428]  They know you are part of an evil group.
[01:14:22.788 --> 01:14:22.968]  That's...
[01:14:47.702 --> 01:14:50.724]  The only thing that you could describe that as is insane.
[01:14:50.724 --> 01:14:52.785]  And, you know, I've experienced that myself.
[01:14:52.785 --> 01:15:02.470]  Maybe not to that extent, but I do have family members that are not very happy with me and haven't been happy with me since 2016.
[01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:06.973]  I'm not sure what happened in 2016, but something happened.
[01:15:06.973 --> 01:15:12.156]  But that's the world that they've created.
[01:15:12.156 --> 01:15:15.878]  And, you know, I find it very funny that
[01:15:17.707 --> 01:15:20.752]  When you try to call out someone on the left for
[01:15:22.108 --> 01:15:25.590]  Doing the exact thing that they are against.
[01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:27.752]  That they just throw it right back at you and they won't even listen.
[01:15:52.628 --> 01:15:54.089]  There is no Nigerian Prince.
[01:15:54.089 --> 01:15:56.271]  Hey, Carpe Dankum, we love you.
[01:15:56.271 --> 01:15:58.232]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:15:58.232 --> 01:16:05.137]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:16:05.137 --> 01:16:13.482]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:16:13.482 --> 01:16:19.166]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:16:19.346 --> 01:16:21.168]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:16:21.168 --> 01:16:23.451]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:16:23.451 --> 01:16:27.836]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:16:27.836 --> 01:16:30.038]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:16:30.038 --> 01:16:37.767]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:17:06.313 --> 01:17:14.019]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[01:17:14.019 --> 01:17:21.905]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[01:17:22.065 --> 01:17:23.865]  Not a security IPO or note.

[01:17:49.192 --> 01:17:49.932]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:51.173]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:17:51.173 --> 01:17:51.894]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:17:51.894 --> 01:17:53.414]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[01:18:15.919 --> 01:18:19.040]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.060]  It's a form of fascism.
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:24.801]  The high court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[01:18:24.801 --> 01:18:36.103]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:18:36.103 --> 01:18:39.544]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[01:18:47.719 --> 01:18:48.941]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:18:58.917 --> 01:19:03.519]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[01:19:59.893 --> 01:20:13.765]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:13.765 --> 01:20:24.194]  On a long and lonesome highway East of Omaha
[01:20:25.942 --> 01:20:31.965]  You can listen to the engine moaning out his one-note song.
[01:20:31.965 --> 01:20:38.649]  You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before.
[01:20:43.826 --> 01:21:01.188]  But your thoughts will soon be wandering The way they always do When you're riding 16 hours And there's nothing much to do And you don't feel much like riding You just wish the trip was through
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.961]  Authoritarianism is not just a word.
[01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:08.841]  It's a system of slavery.
[01:21:08.841 --> 01:21:31.125]  And we are facing biblical level Mark of the Beast, total surveillance, total control by nightmare control freaks obsessed with hurting children, obsessed with destroying families, obsessed with undermining culture and civilization itself, as if they work for some off-world alien spirit that is sworn to destroy human life.
[01:21:33.936 --> 01:21:51.343]  And then you read the Bible and you say, they either predicted all of this because they were warned by another off-world entity, God, or they wrote all this as a self-fulfilling prophecy to actually build it.
[01:21:51.343 --> 01:21:55.484]  But then who told them to build this?
[01:21:55.484 --> 01:21:57.445]  Think about the mysteries of the universe, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:58.854 --> 01:22:00.075]  Now, I was a little late getting in here.
[01:22:00.075 --> 01:22:00.716]  I apologize.
[01:22:00.716 --> 01:22:15.748]  During that break, I run around like a chicken with my head cut off because we have, joining us in studio, Zach Voorhees, who's a very well-spoken, very focused, accomplished Google engineer.
[01:22:15.748 --> 01:22:22.833]  And when we've had other big whistleblowers on, they say, no, this guy is the Ed Snowden leaker.
[01:22:22.833 --> 01:22:24.955]  This is the mother lode.
[01:22:24.955 --> 01:22:28.178]  In fact, I had my big giant stack of the data dump
[01:22:29.133 --> 01:22:32.914]  Not all 2,000 pages, but about 1,000 pages in a folder last week.
[01:22:32.914 --> 01:22:33.914]  Will you guys bring that in to me?
[01:22:33.914 --> 01:22:35.934]  Thanks.
[01:22:35.934 --> 01:22:41.836]  And he's going to be with us for the next two plus hours, as long as he wants to be here.
[01:22:41.836 --> 01:22:49.177]  If he wants to stay to the end, I'm hosting the fourth hour, so that'll be two hours and 40 minutes, roughly.
[01:22:49.177 --> 01:22:50.537]  And so he's waiting right out there.
[01:22:50.537 --> 01:22:51.698]  He's coming in here.
[01:22:51.698 --> 01:22:57.439]  And so after he gets his chance to spill his guts with what he wants to talk about,
[01:22:59.383 --> 01:23:01.244]  We're going to do something I love.
[01:23:01.244 --> 01:23:06.505]  Because I've learned with the callers, when we are on a specific issue, we get amazing calls.
[01:23:06.505 --> 01:23:13.867]  So, it's going to be on Big Tech censorship, it's going to be on Google, and it's going to be on any questions you've got, how to stop it.
[01:23:13.867 --> 01:23:15.988]  But it's not going to be on China, it's not going to be on the U.S.
[01:23:15.988 --> 01:23:21.050]  economy, it's going to be on our ability to communicate in the 21st century.
[01:23:21.050 --> 01:23:23.690]  And this technocracy that's swallowing up our lives.
[01:23:23.690 --> 01:23:27.652]  So we're going to open the phones up next hour.
[01:23:27.652 --> 01:23:28.352]  Specifically.
[01:23:29.673 --> 01:23:34.736]  For you to ask your questions, and I really appreciate him coming here and having this courage.
[01:23:34.736 --> 01:23:36.737]  So this is what InfoWars is all about.
[01:23:36.737 --> 01:23:39.579]  Now I'm going to stop right there.
[01:23:39.579 --> 01:23:44.382]  DredgeReport.com is linked to this article on the left-hand side.
[01:23:44.382 --> 01:23:51.506]  Epstein's cellmate told there will be price to pay if he talks, begs to be transferred to another jail.
[01:23:51.506 --> 01:23:57.890]  The jail guards that were last with Epstein won't talk to the feds either.
[01:23:57.890 --> 01:23:58.751]  Ex-cop Nicholas
[01:24:03.271 --> 01:24:10.352]  Tartaglione basically says they're about to kill him.
[01:24:10.352 --> 01:24:16.233]  This whole thing is so out in the open, so brazen, so crazy.
[01:24:16.233 --> 01:24:18.854]  That story's on the left-hand side of RogerFord.com.
[01:24:18.854 --> 01:24:22.694]  And then there's this headline from Medium.
[01:24:22.694 --> 01:24:26.635]  We're posting it on Infowars.com, written by Zach Voorhees.
[01:24:26.635 --> 01:24:29.816]  And I can't even think of a headline that's powerful enough.
[01:24:29.816 --> 01:24:31.676]  He's going to show you, he does it in this article,
[01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:36.243]  How Google fixes the Clinton death count and other results.
[01:24:36.243 --> 01:24:36.903]  Let me tell you something.
[01:24:36.903 --> 01:24:46.769]  Most of the time I try to search an InfoWars, or a Breitbart, or a Daily Caller, or a Gateway Pundit headline.
[01:24:46.769 --> 01:24:48.730]  It isn't even available.
[01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:54.734]  I mean exact searches aren't available.
[01:24:54.734 --> 01:24:57.696]  And they go up to Congress and go, oh we're not blocking anything.
[01:24:57.696 --> 01:25:01.038]  They're taking control of the whole world's information system.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.341]  Now there's a paradox here.
[01:25:04.341 --> 01:25:09.303]  The more important and powerful the broadcast, and the more larger the audience is, the less I plug.
[01:25:09.303 --> 01:25:18.446]  And everybody knows in talk radio, you're able to find yourself with the plugs that you have during live show.
[01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:22.147]  And so our biggest problem around here finding things is me.
[01:25:22.147 --> 01:25:28.329]  But I will tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that you've seen the ringer they put us through, the persecution, the attacks, all of it.
[01:25:28.329 --> 01:25:31.310]  And because of you, we're still here on air, and we're attempting to expand.
[01:25:32.463 --> 01:25:36.946]  And it's easy, I just haven't got paid this year.
[01:25:36.946 --> 01:25:38.747]  And I'm spending money I saved.
[01:25:38.747 --> 01:25:40.368]  And that's okay.
[01:25:40.368 --> 01:25:43.690]  Because I'm gonna run this thing all the way into the ground.
[01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:45.831]  It'll take a couple years to do it.
[01:25:45.831 --> 01:25:47.292]  I'd rather not do that.
[01:25:47.292 --> 01:25:49.973]  But I'm not up here telling you that just as some little statement.
[01:25:49.973 --> 01:25:51.594]  You've seen what they've done.
[01:25:51.594 --> 01:25:54.156]  We need to be in place in 2020.
[01:25:54.156 --> 01:25:55.977]  And we need to be here
[01:25:57.077 --> 01:26:02.759]  To fight back, but folks need to realize your word of mouth, spreading the word, is what overrides them.
[01:26:02.759 --> 01:26:11.441]  That's why they now want to control instant messages and emails and don't want you to be able to tell people about Alex Jones or Infowars or Trump recruiting women to the campaign.
[01:26:11.441 --> 01:26:13.241]  That's not allowed either!
[01:26:13.241 --> 01:26:14.462]  You see, it's going to be everything!
[01:26:14.462 --> 01:26:15.962]  It's outrageous!
[01:26:15.962 --> 01:26:23.764]  So it's really everybody's duty to spread the word about newswars.com and infowars.com and memeworld.com and anything they're trying to ban.
[01:26:25.401 --> 01:26:33.023]  Because they're really scared of Carpe D'Antem and to realize that it's so easy when you go sign up for auto ship, you can cancel for free anytime, one click.
[01:26:33.023 --> 01:26:47.667]  You get 10% off additionally for the coffee, for the toothpaste, for the fish oil, for the turbo force, for the protein bars, for the things that you're going to want to reorder and lock in that discount.
[01:26:47.667 --> 01:26:48.527]  That way you don't forget.
[01:26:49.423 --> 01:26:53.449]  And every 15 days, every month, every two months, every three months, up to every nine months.
[01:26:53.449 --> 01:26:55.412]  That's how far out an auto ship goes.
[01:26:55.412 --> 01:27:01.280]  Even stuff that sells out from time to time, when you go on an auto ship, it gets saved in the warehouse.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.522]  So, it never runs out.
[01:27:04.810 --> 01:27:19.786]  Now, if I make the decision in the next six months or so, maybe even sooner, whether I'm just going to sell out of all of our inventory and have plenty of money to run for another year or so at full power, and maybe even expand, like kind of burn out like a supernova, or whether I'm going to keep taking the money to order more product.
[01:27:19.786 --> 01:27:21.087]  And I mean, I'm right on the line right now.
[01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:27.353]  We can really just, like, turn on our afterburners, go in, tack the Death Star.
[01:27:27.353 --> 01:27:28.894]  No, we're not going to make it out.
[01:27:28.894 --> 01:27:33.357]  Or we can hopefully get in, get more fuel, tack Death Star, blow it up, and still get away.
[01:27:33.357 --> 01:27:35.399]  But whatever, we're going in on the attack run, okay?
[01:27:35.399 --> 01:27:37.140]  I'm going to use that allegory.
[01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:38.721]  Are you kidding?
[01:27:38.721 --> 01:27:41.163]  I'm foaming at the mouth to get this done.
[01:27:41.163 --> 01:27:44.586]  So, I got a big old you-know-what for the New World Order.
[01:27:45.586 --> 01:27:47.167]  Raging, you know what?
[01:27:47.167 --> 01:27:48.187]  It ain't a nice one either.
[01:27:48.187 --> 01:27:50.568]  I want to get my hands around their neck.
[01:27:50.568 --> 01:27:52.668]  And I've already tasted so much of their blood, man.
[01:27:52.668 --> 01:27:54.789]  I mean, I'm in a shark frenzy right now.
[01:27:54.789 --> 01:27:56.129]  So don't feel sorry for me.
[01:27:56.129 --> 01:27:56.850]  I'm not a victim.
[01:27:56.850 --> 01:27:58.110]  My God, I'm blessed.
[01:27:58.110 --> 01:28:00.091]  But I want you to support us.
[01:28:00.091 --> 01:28:05.092]  So when my political fist smashes into their teeth, I just drive all the way right through them.
[01:28:05.092 --> 01:28:05.572]  You understand?
[01:28:05.572 --> 01:28:06.973]  And it's literally...
[01:28:07.933 --> 01:28:11.775]  Like the allegory, I'm not saying I'm a god, I'm not even, it's an allegory.
[01:28:11.775 --> 01:28:14.256]  When you stop believing in the Greek gods, they die.
[01:28:14.256 --> 01:28:15.737]  They go away, they fade away.
[01:28:15.737 --> 01:28:17.037]  Well, that's an allegory for life.
[01:28:17.037 --> 01:28:20.339]  When you believe in an idea, when you believe in something, it gives it power.
[01:28:20.339 --> 01:28:21.479]  Gives yourself power.
[01:28:21.479 --> 01:28:23.420]  When you give up, you have nothing.
[01:28:24.997 --> 01:28:31.942]  So America's not perfect, but I love the flag, and I love America, and it's been great compared to other places, and so we need to believe in it and love it.
[01:28:31.942 --> 01:28:32.902]  It's the same thing for InfoWars.
[01:28:32.902 --> 01:28:37.405]  So, World Awakens Mega Sale, 50-60% off of all the top-selling products.
[01:28:37.405 --> 01:28:40.047]  This super sale has to end, because a lot of the stuff's selling out.
[01:28:40.047 --> 01:28:41.768]  We've already had to cut back the sale.
[01:28:41.768 --> 01:28:45.971]  Ultimate Krill Oil, BrainForce Plus, Knockout Body, TurboForce, plus lots of other deals.
[01:28:45.971 --> 01:28:47.672]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:28:47.672 --> 01:28:50.654]  Please, take action, and it will change the world.
[01:28:50.654 --> 01:28:52.575]  If you don't, Hillary thanks you.
[01:28:52.575 --> 01:28:53.236]  Seriously.
[01:28:53.236 --> 01:28:54.957]  We'll be back with the big whistleblower in studio.
[01:28:54.957 --> 01:28:55.204]  We're good.
[01:28:56.055 --> 01:28:57.276]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:57.276 --> 01:29:01.199]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:01.199 --> 01:29:02.740]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.702]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:05.702 --> 01:29:11.265]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:11.265 --> 01:29:12.466]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:12.466 --> 01:29:15.408]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:15.408 --> 01:29:17.630]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:17.630 --> 01:29:22.073]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:22.073 --> 01:29:24.414]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:25.755 --> 01:29:29.637]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:29.637 --> 01:29:34.620]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:39.442]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:39.442 --> 01:29:40.783]  Don't just take my word for it.
[01:29:40.783 --> 01:29:44.565]  Check out all of the success stories at hbextract.com.
[01:29:44.565 --> 01:29:45.525]  Or to order, call 866-295-5305.
[01:29:45.525 --> 01:29:46.486]  That's 866-295-5305. hbextract.com.
[01:29:46.486 --> 01:29:48.967]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:57.216 --> 01:29:59.639]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[01:29:59.639 --> 01:30:03.122]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[01:30:03.122 --> 01:30:04.644]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[01:30:04.644 --> 01:30:05.965]  I want to take the globalist on.
[01:30:05.965 --> 01:30:07.927]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[01:30:07.927 --> 01:30:12.892]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[01:30:13.092 --> 01:30:16.055]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[01:30:16.055 --> 01:30:24.484]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus, but Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[01:30:24.484 --> 01:30:27.106]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[01:30:27.106 --> 01:30:32.792]  It's totally full of the bottle, and it is the strongest, purest krill oil, and it cost us three times more
[01:30:33.012 --> 01:30:37.715]  Because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[01:30:37.715 --> 01:30:43.519]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[01:30:43.519 --> 01:30:45.761]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[01:30:45.761 --> 01:30:46.681]  This is not real.
[01:30:46.681 --> 01:30:51.325]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:30:51.325 --> 01:30:52.906]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[01:30:52.906 --> 01:30:54.487]  It's not yellow, it's not milky.
[01:30:54.487 --> 01:30:56.028]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[01:30:57.108 --> 01:31:08.335]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[01:31:08.335 --> 01:31:12.457]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[01:31:12.457 --> 01:31:21.823]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[01:31:22.563 --> 01:31:24.585]  The system is vulnerable.
[01:31:24.585 --> 01:31:27.267]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[01:31:27.267 --> 01:31:30.909]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[01:31:30.909 --> 01:31:37.815]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[01:31:37.815 --> 01:31:43.779]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.
[01:31:43.779 --> 01:31:48.283]  Buy storable foods and an Alexa Pure Gravity Water Filter today.
[01:31:48.983 --> 01:31:55.715]  Support mankind by being prepared and support freedom by buying from Infowarsstore.com
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:10.123]  Thomas Jefferson predicted, over 240 years ago, that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[01:32:10.123 --> 01:32:13.044]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[01:32:13.044 --> 01:32:18.445]  farming goods a week ago, and we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[01:32:19.085 --> 01:32:23.646]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[01:32:23.646 --> 01:32:24.686]  That's beautiful.
[01:32:24.686 --> 01:32:26.587]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[01:32:26.587 --> 01:32:28.187]  And we aren't going to back down.
[01:32:28.187 --> 01:32:35.789]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:32:35.789 --> 01:32:38.110]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[01:32:38.110 --> 01:32:42.271]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWorks.com.
[01:32:42.271 --> 01:32:43.211]  And I'm asking listeners,
[01:32:43.991 --> 01:32:48.115]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[01:32:48.115 --> 01:32:49.216]  We are the resistance.
[01:32:49.216 --> 01:32:59.907]  We are 1776 Worldwide!
[01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:02.530]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:08.277 --> 01:33:08.898]  We've got it.
[01:33:08.898 --> 01:33:15.407]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:33:15.407 --> 01:33:19.793]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:19.793 --> 01:33:25.460]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:35.721 --> 01:33:36.622]  We're good.
[01:34:10.731 --> 01:34:11.791]  My name is Will Johnson.
[01:34:11.791 --> 01:34:13.392]  Firepowernews.com.
[01:34:13.392 --> 01:34:14.873]  We are in Portland, Oregon.
[01:34:14.873 --> 01:34:17.454]  Antifa is already at the park.
[01:34:17.454 --> 01:34:20.235]  They've blocked off a lot of entries to the city.
[01:34:20.235 --> 01:34:21.655]  Stay tuned.
[01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:23.076]  You're going to see this and a lot more.
[01:34:59.471 --> 01:34:59.791]  Hope?
[01:34:59.791 --> 01:35:00.452]  Hate?
[01:35:00.452 --> 01:35:01.332]  You're hoping for hate?
[01:35:01.332 --> 01:35:02.993]  Is that what this means?
[01:35:02.993 --> 01:35:05.334]  What does it mean?
[01:35:05.334 --> 01:35:05.795]  Why not?
[01:35:05.795 --> 01:35:09.256]  Don't you want to get your message out?
[01:35:09.256 --> 01:35:10.317]  Yeah, that's what we're all here.
[01:35:10.317 --> 01:35:11.418]  We're all here peacefully.
[01:35:11.418 --> 01:35:14.759]  What is your message then?
[01:35:14.759 --> 01:35:17.121]  Silent, peaceful protests.
[01:35:17.121 --> 01:35:20.603]  What are you protesting?
[01:35:20.603 --> 01:35:25.105]  Okay, where's the hate?
[01:35:25.105 --> 01:35:27.466]  I brought hate to your city, so you're calling me hateful.
[01:35:27.466 --> 01:35:28.107]  How am I hateful?
[01:35:29.668 --> 01:35:30.929]  I mean, you're protesting.
[01:35:30.929 --> 01:35:33.050]  I want to know how I'm hateful.
[01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:36.192]  I mean, you're saying a lot by holding your signs here.
[01:35:36.192 --> 01:35:38.854]  So I just want to make sure I understand.
[01:35:38.854 --> 01:35:40.775]  You're saying that you're going against hate.
[01:35:40.775 --> 01:35:42.976]  You have this shirt on that says resist.
[01:35:42.976 --> 01:35:44.958]  What exactly are you resisting?
[01:35:44.958 --> 01:35:46.218]  Because we love this country.
[01:35:46.218 --> 01:35:47.139]  We love America.
[01:35:47.139 --> 01:35:48.200]  Everyone should have their freedoms.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.420]  You were born in Africa?
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:51.641]  Do you hate this country?
[01:35:51.641 --> 01:35:53.381]  Do you hate this country?
[01:35:53.381 --> 01:35:55.582]  Then why don't you go back?
[01:35:55.582 --> 01:35:58.382]  Then why don't you go back?
[01:35:58.382 --> 01:36:03.764]  If you don't represent this country, you don't like this country, you can go back.
[01:36:03.764 --> 01:36:05.964]  If you don't like this country, you can go back.
[01:36:05.964 --> 01:36:07.665]  No one's keeping you here.
[01:36:07.665 --> 01:36:08.845]  No one can keep you here.
[01:36:08.845 --> 01:36:10.045]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:36:10.045 --> 01:36:11.446]  Africa, you represent America.
[01:36:13.767 --> 01:36:16.410]  Then why don't you go back then?
[01:36:16.410 --> 01:36:17.851]  Why don't you go back?
[01:36:17.851 --> 01:36:19.032]  What's keeping you here?
[01:36:19.032 --> 01:36:20.974]  What's keeping you here?
[01:36:20.974 --> 01:36:23.157]  What's keeping you here?
[01:36:23.157 --> 01:36:25.079]  What is keeping you here?
[01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:26.520]  What's keeping you here?
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:28.002]  Your people are here.
[01:36:28.002 --> 01:36:31.686]  People like me, you don't even know the history.
[01:36:31.686 --> 01:36:33.427]  There it is, you don't know the history.
[01:36:33.427 --> 01:36:35.289]  You don't know the history.
[01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:37.391]  You don't know the history.
[01:36:37.391 --> 01:36:38.751]  Do you hear yourself?
[01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:40.953]  You don't even hear yourself.
[01:36:40.953 --> 01:36:42.093]  One question.
[01:36:42.093 --> 01:36:43.114]  One question.
[01:36:43.114 --> 01:36:44.174]  One question.
[01:36:44.174 --> 01:36:45.175]  One question.
[01:36:45.175 --> 01:36:54.079]  During slavery, during slavery, who owned the homes for the Underground Railroad?
[01:36:54.079 --> 01:36:55.860]  Wait a minute.
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:57.201]  Wait a minute.
[01:36:57.201 --> 01:36:58.182]  We'll get to that.
[01:36:58.182 --> 01:36:59.262]  We'll get to that.
[01:36:59.262 --> 01:37:00.623]  Answer my question.
[01:37:00.623 --> 01:37:01.884]  Answer my question.
[01:37:03.565 --> 01:37:05.106]  See, he won't even answer it.
[01:37:05.106 --> 01:37:06.146]  It's a simple question.
[01:37:06.146 --> 01:37:09.469]  Who owned the homes to the Underground Railroad?
[01:37:09.469 --> 01:37:13.992]  During the Civil War, who owned the deeds to the houses for the Underground Railroad?
[01:37:13.992 --> 01:37:14.792]  It was white people.
[01:37:19.536 --> 01:37:20.978]  Okay.
[01:37:20.978 --> 01:37:24.081]  See, when you think about it, when you think about it, then you'll know.
[01:37:24.081 --> 01:37:25.263]  What about them over there?
[01:37:25.263 --> 01:37:26.685]  What about them over there, Antifa?
[01:37:26.685 --> 01:37:27.005]  Seriously?
[01:37:27.005 --> 01:37:28.166]  Will you denounce Antifa?
[01:37:35.715 --> 01:37:36.055]  What?
[01:37:36.055 --> 01:37:37.936]  Will you denounce Antifa?
[01:37:37.936 --> 01:37:40.896]  There it is.
[01:37:40.896 --> 01:37:42.597]  There it is.
[01:37:42.597 --> 01:37:44.437]  There it is.
[01:37:44.437 --> 01:37:45.717]  There it is.
[01:37:45.717 --> 01:37:47.918]  Do you think it's possible that you've been deceived?
[01:37:47.918 --> 01:37:48.698]  Is it possible?
[01:37:48.698 --> 01:37:50.298]  I'm just asking, is it possible?
[01:37:50.298 --> 01:37:53.019]  It is possible that literally everybody on this planet has been deceived.
[01:37:53.019 --> 01:37:57.400]  It is possible that this planet has literally just started this second with everything behind us.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:59.040]  There's no way you'd be able to disprove that.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:01.021]  So of course, yes, I could be a deceiver.
[01:38:01.021 --> 01:38:01.861]  Are you talking about me?
[01:38:01.861 --> 01:38:02.321]  Do you know?
[01:38:07.643 --> 01:38:13.705]  We are here to show our support for America and to say stop domestic terrorism.
[01:38:13.705 --> 01:38:16.106]  Stop domestic terrorism.
[01:38:16.106 --> 01:38:20.248]  Antifa, the Democrats, they have been terrorizing people far too long.
[01:38:20.248 --> 01:38:24.549]  Do you think my presence as a brown gay man scares them?
[01:38:24.549 --> 01:38:24.970]  Not at all.
[01:38:24.970 --> 01:38:25.690]  Not at all.
[01:38:25.690 --> 01:38:26.110]  Not at all.
[01:38:26.110 --> 01:38:30.792]  Not at zero if you've been told otherwise they'd lie to you.
[01:38:31.392 --> 01:38:39.280]  So I'm trying to just ask them exactly what hate is it that they're referring to because I'm just kind of curious.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:44.846]  Do you still, would you please just at least tell me what the hate is?
[01:38:44.846 --> 01:38:47.109]  Any comments?
[01:38:47.109 --> 01:38:48.290]  Any comments on what the hate is?
[01:38:49.964 --> 01:38:52.507]  Because it looks like the Obama symbol to me.
[01:38:52.507 --> 01:38:57.073]  And Obama, as far as black people, represents complete, total hate in this country.
[01:38:57.073 --> 01:39:01.999]  Because Obama really helped destroy the black community in this nation.
[01:39:01.999 --> 01:39:05.123]  Let's get back to your sign here.
[01:39:05.123 --> 01:39:08.947]  You're saying the alt-right caused Heather to die?
[01:39:08.947 --> 01:39:09.128]  Yes.
[01:39:10.228 --> 01:39:12.469]  When she wasn't invited.
[01:39:12.469 --> 01:39:14.510]  Why are you fixated on who's invited?
[01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:19.333]  Because you're blaming someone for something that they weren't involved in.
[01:39:19.333 --> 01:39:29.699]  So in your example, okay, in your example of the, uh, I don't remember this particular one, but I, sure, let's say there's a Muslim attack with a truck.
[01:39:29.699 --> 01:39:30.059]  In New York.
[01:39:30.519 --> 01:39:33.202]  I don't remember the New York one, I remember other ones, so whatever.
[01:39:33.202 --> 01:39:34.663]  There's been multiple ones.
[01:39:34.663 --> 01:39:36.745]  Yeah, there's been multiple ones in other countries.
[01:39:36.745 --> 01:39:37.786]  There's been multiple ones.
[01:39:37.786 --> 01:39:38.467]  Let's go with New York.
[01:39:38.467 --> 01:39:42.591]  But New York, there was a time when the Muslims ran people down a Home Depot truck, killed Americans.
[01:39:42.591 --> 01:39:43.491]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:39:43.491 --> 01:39:46.094]  And it was Americans' fault that it took place, what you're saying.
[01:39:47.375 --> 01:39:49.116]  Wait, that is not the equivalence at all.
[01:39:49.116 --> 01:39:53.959]  So you are saying that the people who he hit are at fault?
[01:39:53.959 --> 01:39:55.460]  Because that's the other hierarchy.
[01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:55.921]  No, no, no.
[01:39:55.921 --> 01:40:02.645]  You're saying that the people in New York that happened to be around that area that didn't die is their fault for being in New York.
[01:40:02.645 --> 01:40:02.985]  No, no.
[01:40:02.985 --> 01:40:05.367]  People who are putting the same ideology as him.
[01:40:05.367 --> 01:40:07.268]  How is it their fault, though?
[01:40:07.268 --> 01:40:09.309]  It's still not their fault.
[01:40:09.309 --> 01:40:11.771]  I mean, the driver had the biggest amount of fault.
[01:40:11.971 --> 01:40:12.671]  Of course.
[01:40:12.671 --> 01:40:14.112]  Just like the gun.
[01:40:14.112 --> 01:40:22.034]  It's not the law-abiding citizen's fault for an idiot going out and shooting someone with a gun.
[01:40:22.034 --> 01:40:23.254]  It's not even the gun's fault.
[01:40:23.254 --> 01:40:25.815]  It's the idiot with the gun.
[01:40:25.815 --> 01:40:26.815]  It's common sense.
[01:40:26.815 --> 01:40:28.295]  Antifa does not stop.
[01:40:28.295 --> 01:40:33.797]  If Willer and the rest of these Democrats do not denounce Antifa, you gotta know that the American
[01:40:34.958 --> 01:40:42.001]  Do you have a copy of the leaks available so that when I start talking about them, you guys are going to be able to just pull it up on the main screen?
[01:40:42.001 --> 01:40:42.522]  Absolutely.
[01:40:42.522 --> 01:40:43.022]  We'll do that.
[01:40:43.022 --> 01:40:43.802]  We're live on air.
[01:40:43.802 --> 01:40:45.263]  This is very exciting.
[01:40:45.263 --> 01:40:47.865]  This is not scripted CNN, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:47.865 --> 01:40:51.847]  We are broadcasting worldwide and we come back from break in a few minutes.
[01:40:51.847 --> 01:40:53.768]  We're going to kick off here.
[01:40:53.768 --> 01:41:02.713]  We were getting some computers hooked up and getting some documents loaded into the computers so that we can do this presentation that's going to go well into
[01:41:03.653 --> 01:41:05.474]  The fourth hour today.
[01:41:05.474 --> 01:41:07.455]  Again, I am Alex Jones, your host.
[01:41:07.455 --> 01:41:09.537]  We're going to come back with our guest in the next segment.
[01:41:09.537 --> 01:41:15.200]  We're going to be talking to a major Google whistleblower.
[01:41:16.530 --> 01:41:30.319]  Here in studio, and obviously if we don't expose what Big Tech is doing, and we don't expose how they've been lying to Congress, and if we don't bring all this out, we're going to lose this country.
[01:41:30.319 --> 01:41:39.565]  And President Trump is very, very, very close to taking action against Big Tech.
[01:41:40.618 --> 01:41:45.682]  And we need to have major public pressure on what Trump should do.
[01:41:45.682 --> 01:41:48.505]  So we're having a big open discussion about this.
[01:41:48.505 --> 01:41:53.709]  Something that big tech has been working around the clock to try to stop.
[01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:54.910]  So if you go to InfoWars.com
[01:41:57.410 --> 01:42:02.215]  We'll put that on screen for TV viewers, the article I was just talking to you guys a few minutes about.
[01:42:02.215 --> 01:42:15.426]  Google Insider exposes how search results are rigged by tech giant whistleblower Zachary Voorhees is live in studio with Alex Jones to take your questions.
[01:42:15.426 --> 01:42:17.948]  So, you know, and I'm going to do this with the next guest.
[01:42:17.948 --> 01:42:19.450]  I really wanted Jada
[01:42:20.779 --> 01:42:22.920]  Franson on for a month.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.980]  We couldn't get her, but now she's able to come on.
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:25.801]  But this is so important.
[01:42:25.801 --> 01:42:30.402]  We're going to clear the decks, and we apologize to her at jadafranson.online.
[01:42:30.402 --> 01:42:34.363]  We're just going to move that on because we're getting started a little bit later today.
[01:42:34.363 --> 01:42:37.444]  But when we come back, we're launching straight into this.
[01:42:37.444 --> 01:42:43.166]  And this whistleblower that came here, his colleagues are calling him the Ed Snowden of Big Tech Whistleblowers.
[01:42:43.166 --> 01:42:44.107]  This is huge.
[01:42:44.107 --> 01:42:46.287]  He's put out the big data dump.
[01:42:46.287 --> 01:42:47.868]  This is incredibly important.
[01:42:48.368 --> 01:42:49.629]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[01:42:49.629 --> 01:42:51.210]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:42:51.210 --> 01:42:52.330]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:54.292]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[01:43:14.878 --> 01:43:18.019]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[01:43:18.019 --> 01:43:19.079]  It's a form of fascism.
[01:43:19.079 --> 01:43:23.761]  The high court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[01:43:23.761 --> 01:43:35.085]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:43:35.085 --> 01:43:38.526]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[01:43:46.693 --> 01:43:47.914]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:43:56.633 --> 01:43:59.055]  One half of the incredible eight pack power stack.
[01:43:59.055 --> 01:44:03.238]  The AM wake up and work packet is exactly what you need to start your day right.
[01:44:03.238 --> 01:44:09.462]  The pack contains five original formulas built to fuel your day and take care of your body's individual needs in the morning.
[01:44:09.462 --> 01:44:13.084]  Targeting the heart, brain, muscles, energy production and more.
[01:44:13.084 --> 01:44:20.029]  Each AM pack contains a flex and joint support, energy kickstart, krill oil, nootropic brain and greens detox formula.
[01:44:20.849 --> 01:44:21.630]  With the P.M.
[01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:26.333]  pack in the eight pack power stack, you can rest easy and simplify your routine.
[01:44:26.333 --> 01:44:28.955]  Containing four original formulas, the P.M.
[01:44:28.955 --> 01:44:35.400]  rest and recover pack will build up your body's defenses and help you get restful, satisfying sleep every night.
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:39.743]  Containing bone support, krill oil, sound sleep and immune support formulas.
[01:44:39.743 --> 01:44:40.284]  The P.M.
[01:44:40.284 --> 01:44:46.148]  packet was created to support improving your body's bones and immune system all while you rest from the day's work.
[01:44:46.388 --> 01:44:47.669]  When combined with the A.M.
[01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:53.193]  wake up and work packet, it makes the eight pack power stack the new can't miss InfoWars life product.
[01:44:57.410 --> 01:45:13.294]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[01:45:13.294 --> 01:45:15.015]  It is completely independent of all that.
[01:45:15.015 --> 01:45:25.898]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom from press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[01:45:26.118 --> 01:45:26.498]  We're good.
[01:45:45.953 --> 01:45:49.637]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:13.163]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:46:13.163 --> 01:46:24.810]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:46:24.810 --> 01:46:29.013]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:46:29.913 --> 01:46:33.956]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[01:46:33.956 --> 01:46:40.860]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:43.782]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[01:46:43.782 --> 01:46:53.467]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high-quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:59.874 --> 01:47:02.556]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:33.337 --> 01:47:39.561]  We are joined here in studio by Zach Voorhees, perpetual maniac on Twitter.
[01:47:39.561 --> 01:47:41.582]  And I'm not going to even try to go over his whole bio here.
[01:47:41.582 --> 01:47:45.045]  You've been on a couple times with us.
[01:47:45.045 --> 01:47:47.166]  Google is battling to suppress this information.
[01:47:47.166 --> 01:47:49.808]  You're a major engineer that has released what they call the
[01:47:51.172 --> 01:47:54.793]  Ed Snowden-level dump on big tech and their massive censorship.
[01:47:54.793 --> 01:48:02.336]  You've written a new article for Medium.com that details when they're rigging search results and when they aren't and how it's being done.
[01:48:02.336 --> 01:48:03.296]  So thanks for being here.
[01:48:03.296 --> 01:48:04.477]  Thank you very much, Alex Jones.
[01:48:04.477 --> 01:48:06.297]  It's a pleasure being on your show today.
[01:48:06.297 --> 01:48:07.998]  It's a pleasure to have you, Zach.
[01:48:07.998 --> 01:48:10.679]  Get into whatever you want because I really want to let you talk about
[01:48:11.593 --> 01:48:20.736]  The world, why you did this, where you see this going, what you think about the integrity of the elections, what you think about all the new censorship coming out and happening.
[01:48:20.736 --> 01:48:25.457]  Now they're not even letting Trump send out things saying, we want to recruit strong women like you.
[01:48:25.457 --> 01:48:29.978]  They say that's a triggering word, because maybe a person that isn't a woman sees the name woman.
[01:48:29.978 --> 01:48:31.539]  This is beyond mental illness.
[01:48:31.539 --> 01:48:33.299]  This is a plan to kill the language.
[01:48:33.299 --> 01:48:37.981]  And what you think Trump should do, because Trump is listening, and so is Congress, and
[01:48:39.881 --> 01:48:41.802]  The leader of the Senate from being on Twitter.
[01:48:41.802 --> 01:48:47.804]  I mean, I think they're really starting to understand that big tech is really in a power map.
[01:48:47.804 --> 01:48:57.728]  Yeah, you know, they are trying to sculpt the information landscape and they've been telling us, you know, in congressional testimony that they don't have any political bias.
[01:48:57.728 --> 01:49:02.370]  And at this point, the political bias is so strong that there's just they're not fooling anyone.
[01:49:03.310 --> 01:49:12.892]  I mean, they banned the Facebook ad for Women for Trump because they're assuming the audience is gender?
[01:49:12.892 --> 01:49:17.993]  Like, what kind of clown rule is this that this sort of thing is allowed to happen?
[01:49:17.993 --> 01:49:28.396]  And so, you know, Google's been involved in election meddling for a while now, and this is something that I discovered as an insider working for the company.
[01:49:29.976 --> 01:49:46.321]  I decided that I was going to take the documents that were publicly available to the internal network and capture them and dox Google to the world so that people could really understand what was really going on at Google.
[01:49:47.708 --> 01:49:52.855]  And again, recap what you released, how you decided to do it, what it details.
[01:49:52.855 --> 01:49:57.781]  Yeah, so let's go back to like 2016.
[01:49:57.781 --> 01:49:59.663]  Donald Trump got elected and
[01:50:00.908 --> 01:50:04.952]  The corporate culture of Google radically changed.
[01:50:04.952 --> 01:50:07.395]  It did a 180 degree change.
[01:50:07.395 --> 01:50:19.608]  And they went from everyone should be able to express yourself to there's a bunch of fake news and we need to start censoring that because that is unduly influencing people.
[01:50:19.608 --> 01:50:23.031]  And also they believe that Russia hacked the election.
[01:50:23.692 --> 01:50:36.377]  And so the executives didn't really see the opposing evidence that the Russians didn't hack the election, that it was actually an insider that leaked this information.
[01:50:36.377 --> 01:50:42.299]  And so we thought that, well, I thought that maybe this information would eventually reach them, but it didn't.
[01:50:42.299 --> 01:50:44.920]  They sort of like doubled down and they kept on doubling down.
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:47.121]  And so, you know,
[01:50:48.121 --> 01:50:49.102]  All right.
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:09.827]  Project Veritas, which is an amazing journalist outlet.
[01:51:09.827 --> 01:51:13.351]  They do undercover work and I gave the documents to them.
[01:51:13.351 --> 01:51:19.979]  They did a sting operation on one of the executives, Jen Janai, and Jen Janai admitted
[01:51:21.681 --> 01:51:21.961]  I think?
[01:51:40.495 --> 01:51:48.799]  Google then targeted me and ended up swatting me at my house and sending bomb squad people because they called in a wellness check.
[01:51:48.799 --> 01:51:55.362]  And at that point I realized that my life was in danger, this wasn't going to go away, and that the only way to
[01:51:57.023 --> 01:51:58.525]  And now they've been caught red-handed.
[01:52:14.928 --> 01:52:41.391]  And so, Twitter again bans the Senate leader, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who just simply linked to video of people coming to his house saying, we're gonna kill you, but left the accounts up that he was linking to on Twitter, and then now, like you said, Facebook, I'm gonna put this on screen in color if we can for TV viewers, Facebook bans Trump campaign ads today for assuming gender identity, and it's the exact same ads Hillary put out
[01:52:42.168 --> 01:52:47.159]  The Women for Trump Coalition needs the support of strong women like you.
[01:52:47.159 --> 01:52:49.644]  They said, well maybe someone who's not a woman sees this.
[01:52:49.644 --> 01:52:51.589]  Well yeah, like thumbing through a magazine.
[01:52:52.458 --> 01:52:53.699]  You see ads for weddings.
[01:52:53.699 --> 01:52:55.419]  Maybe you're not getting married.
[01:52:55.419 --> 01:53:04.363]  The idea with this San Francisco culture seems to be what it is, projected through big tech, that they can ban anything they want if someone's offended.
[01:53:04.363 --> 01:53:05.504]  It's like a new language.
[01:53:05.504 --> 01:53:06.784]  It's like a virus.
[01:53:06.784 --> 01:53:12.587]  What would you call this where a group of women supporting Trump hurts people that aren't women?
[01:53:12.587 --> 01:53:16.108]  It's like saying the word mother and father is bad.
[01:53:16.108 --> 01:53:19.350]  They really mean to impose this total war on language.
[01:53:19.770 --> 01:53:34.942]  Right, and this is something that George Orwell talked about in his book, 1984, and what he predicted was that the totalitarians would be able to seize control of society through linguistical hacking.
[01:53:34.942 --> 01:53:39.746]  And so, he had this word called double-speak.
[01:53:39.746 --> 01:53:40.387]  Double-think.
[01:53:40.387 --> 01:53:44.430]  Double-think, double-speak, and this... Crime-stop.
[01:53:45.010 --> 01:53:45.331]  Yeah.
[01:53:45.331 --> 01:53:47.032]  If you have a logical thought, you gotta kill that?
[01:53:47.032 --> 01:53:48.594]  You gotta kill that, you gotta suppress it.
[01:53:48.594 --> 01:53:53.778]  And so, what these totalitarians are doing is that they're attacking us at the language level.
[01:53:53.778 --> 01:54:07.091]  And the thing is, is that if they can change the definition of words so that they don't mean what they used to, then you have to actually understand their parallel definition of all the words in order to make sense of what they're saying.
[01:54:07.091 --> 01:54:08.212]  So it's a coded priesthood?
[01:54:08.752 --> 01:54:12.093]  I mean, just like gangs use codes, this is like a military.
[01:54:12.093 --> 01:54:15.194]  It uses scrambled communications.
[01:54:15.194 --> 01:54:15.614]  Right.
[01:54:15.614 --> 01:54:18.635]  It's weaponized propaganda that is being pushed.
[01:54:18.635 --> 01:54:22.136]  And the thing is, is that it's not just one media outlet.
[01:54:22.136 --> 01:54:24.097]  It's a whole bunch of establishment players.
[01:54:24.097 --> 01:54:25.477]  Oh, they've all linked up.
[01:54:25.477 --> 01:54:25.757]  Yeah.
[01:54:25.757 --> 01:54:31.259]  They're all banning Twitter, Facebook, Meme World, and memeworld.com in live time.
[01:54:31.579 --> 01:54:32.480]  Yes, they are.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:37.443]  And the reason why they're doing this is because contradictions to the narrative are very damaging.
[01:54:37.443 --> 01:54:53.115]  And this was proved in a study in the 1960s called the Ash Experiment, in which there was a volunteer that was a research person, and he goes in and he sees a classroom with like seven other what he thinks are volunteers, but they're actually actors.
[01:54:53.855 --> 01:55:03.819]  And so, um, there is a instructor that goes onto the chalkboard and writes one line, and then he writes another line, and he's like, which line is, um, is larger?
[01:55:03.819 --> 01:55:06.381]  And all the actors give the wrong answer.
[01:55:06.381 --> 01:55:09.442]  Well, guess what the volunteer, what the volunteer's answer is?
[01:55:09.442 --> 01:55:10.382]  The wrong one.
[01:55:10.382 --> 01:55:12.143]  He also gives the wrong one, so he falls in line.
[01:55:12.143 --> 01:55:15.985]  Now, here's, here's the thing that's really crazy about this experiment.
[01:55:15.985 --> 01:55:22.808]  If one of the actors gives the right answer, then this consensus effect is broken.
[01:55:24.068 --> 01:55:24.589]  Okay.
[01:55:24.589 --> 01:55:34.337]  And so, in order for these totalitarians to be able to seize control of a society, they need to have a total lockdown on the information landscape.
[01:55:34.337 --> 01:55:41.764]  And so, people like you, Alex Jones, that come here and, you know, contradict the narratives of these establishment players,
[01:55:43.765 --> 01:55:54.169]  That breaks the consensus effect because people try to, you know, they start researching what you say and a lot of the things that you say are actually true and that's devastating for these totalitarians.
[01:55:54.169 --> 01:56:05.634]  They don't want true information to be coming out and so they've made a concerted effort to be able to block information that contradicts their establishment narrative.
[01:56:05.634 --> 01:56:06.614]  I want to go back to this.
[01:56:06.974 --> 01:56:07.414]  I don't know.
[01:56:23.587 --> 01:56:24.448]  Vertical lines.
[01:56:24.448 --> 01:56:26.389]  I mean, you know, it's one thing if it's horizontal.
[01:56:26.389 --> 01:56:27.670]  Some people aren't good at that.
[01:56:27.670 --> 01:56:31.493]  These are clear, vertical lines that any idiot can see.
[01:56:31.493 --> 01:56:32.413]  Which one is the tallest?
[01:56:32.413 --> 01:56:33.554]  It's number two.
[01:56:33.554 --> 01:56:38.298]  But if everybody else says the other line, then the people via peer pressure go with it.
[01:56:38.298 --> 01:56:39.779]  I guess that's the follower instinct.
[01:56:39.779 --> 01:56:41.980]  But isn't it what leadership is?
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:45.783]  Is to do the right thing even when the mass isn't for you?
[01:56:45.783 --> 01:56:46.264]  Right.
[01:56:46.264 --> 01:56:50.627]  You know, a sign of a good leader is one that has an allegiance to truth.
[01:56:51.291 --> 01:56:54.956]  You know, and honesty.
[01:56:54.956 --> 01:57:05.129]  But those leaderships pose a threat to the establishment, and so they need to be demonized, need to be slandered by these giant... And isn't that the essence of a successful civilization?
[01:57:05.129 --> 01:57:06.091]  Is allegiance to truth.
[01:57:06.311 --> 01:57:07.412]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:57:07.412 --> 01:57:11.756]  Every society that has had allegiance to truth has been one that's been strong.
[01:57:11.756 --> 01:57:21.826]  And every society that's fallen towards Marxism, or fallen into Marxism, has established first this political correctness and this control over speech.
[01:57:21.826 --> 01:57:24.529]  And this happened in Russia, this happened in China.
[01:57:24.529 --> 01:57:26.411]  Look how smart this Google engineer is.
[01:57:26.411 --> 01:57:28.633]  Imagine they've got a lot of other smart ones working for the bad guys.
[01:57:28.633 --> 01:57:29.194]  That's scary.
[01:57:29.774 --> 01:57:39.341]  Oh my God, I'm glad you brought this up because then you've got the Milner experiments and all the others where they get the majority of people that are actors to say, hey let's electrocute this student to death.
[01:57:39.341 --> 01:57:41.283]  Most people will do it!
[01:57:41.283 --> 01:57:44.165]  Yes, most people under peer pressure will act like Nazis.
[01:57:44.165 --> 01:57:45.326]  For real, real Nazis.
[01:57:45.706 --> 01:57:58.892]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[01:57:58.892 --> 01:58:01.813]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[01:58:01.813 --> 01:58:03.554]  farming goods a week ago.
[01:58:03.554 --> 01:58:07.216]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[01:58:07.856 --> 01:58:12.400]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:13.461]  That's beautiful.
[01:58:13.461 --> 01:58:15.343]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[01:58:15.343 --> 01:58:16.965]  And we aren't going to back down.
[01:58:16.965 --> 01:58:24.552]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:58:24.552 --> 01:58:26.894]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.

[02:00:28.863 --> 02:00:40.769]  Well, I'm having a lot of fun and we had another great guest coming on but I've cleared the decks and I appreciate her coming on Friday because we are covering the hardcore subjects right now with Zach here in studio with us.
[02:00:40.769 --> 02:00:46.132]  Google Insider shows how to detect when Google is lying about autocomplete's political bias.
[02:00:46.132 --> 02:00:47.393]  It's up on medium.com.
[02:00:47.393 --> 02:00:49.574]  We have added it to infowars.com.
[02:00:49.574 --> 02:00:52.996]  He's going to get to that next segment and whatever he wants for the next two hours.
[02:00:53.962 --> 02:00:54.062]  We're
[02:01:24.222 --> 02:01:25.744]  An experiment in conformity.
[02:01:25.744 --> 02:01:34.110]  Yeah, so I learned about this experiment when I was getting my major in psychology at the University of Oregon, and it was really a groundbreaking study.
[02:01:34.110 --> 02:01:39.915]  Like, no one ever knew that the consensus was that strong, at least in the public domain.
[02:01:39.915 --> 02:01:47.481]  And so I saw this experiment in my textbooks, and then I looked it up on YouTube, and I saw the whole video on it.
[02:01:48.462 --> 02:01:54.444]  I was like, wow, this is really a fundamental insight into human psychology.
[02:01:54.444 --> 02:01:57.186]  And then things started to make a lot more sense.
[02:01:57.186 --> 02:02:04.028]  Like, you need to have everyone within a contained Overton window of acceptable political discourse.
[02:02:04.028 --> 02:02:06.169]  And let's put the footage of that experiment back up.
[02:02:06.169 --> 02:02:06.950]  I'm intrigued.
[02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:07.430]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:08.390]  Yeah.
[02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:16.236]  And so, you know, what they're doing is that they're taking the Overton window of political discourse, kind of, and then what they're doing is that they're narrowing it down to one wrong answer.
[02:02:16.236 --> 02:02:19.998]  And then the person, you know, responds by going along with the consensus.
[02:02:19.998 --> 02:02:23.280]  And this experiment has been repeated over and over and over and over again.
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:28.064]  Um, and yeah, it's, it's, it's one of the fun, you know, foundational studies.
[02:02:28.064 --> 02:02:32.526]  If anyone wants to understand what's going on, then what they should do is they should look at this experiment.
[02:02:32.526 --> 02:02:36.669]  You know, it's, it exists on YouTube and exists on, on BitChute still.
[02:02:36.669 --> 02:02:37.370]  And the old
[02:02:38.531 --> 02:02:41.133]  Google model was based on what people liked and what they clicked.
[02:02:41.133 --> 02:02:50.303]  It was a very honest thing of crowdsourcing and kind of the wisdom of the common man that, hey, everybody's going to that restaurant or everybody's drinking out of that well.
[02:02:50.303 --> 02:02:51.324]  The water must be good.
[02:02:51.324 --> 02:02:52.505]  The food must be good.
[02:02:52.505 --> 02:02:55.127]  So they kind of jack into our own human consciousness that.
[02:02:55.808 --> 02:02:58.990]  Well, these are real people, and they all see it's the other length.
[02:02:58.990 --> 02:03:01.412]  I must be out of my mind today.
[02:03:01.412 --> 02:03:05.454]  I must have a problem with my eyes, so I'll go with them because I trust my tribe.
[02:03:05.454 --> 02:03:06.695]  I trust my people.
[02:03:06.695 --> 02:03:11.398]  But these were six mercenaries hired to all lie to you to make you feel alone.
[02:03:11.398 --> 02:03:12.359]  This is gaslighting.
[02:03:12.759 --> 02:03:13.240]  It is.
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:14.461]  It is gaslighting.
[02:03:14.461 --> 02:03:18.105]  And it's too bad that it's happening.
[02:03:18.105 --> 02:03:29.798]  And the thing is, is that what's really surprising is that Eric Schmidt in 2005 on Charlie Rose actually disclosed what they were planning on doing with Google.
[02:03:29.798 --> 02:03:33.062]  And what he did is he explained that
[02:03:34.165 --> 02:03:35.005]  I'm good.
[02:03:52.731 --> 02:03:54.992]  And this is really, like, mind-blowing.
[02:03:54.992 --> 02:04:00.954]  And for me, I thought, well, you know... He was admitting, we're getting you all hooked with a real crowd source.
[02:04:00.954 --> 02:04:03.995]  You're really interfacing with human intelligence through a machine.
[02:04:03.995 --> 02:04:05.835]  All of us coming together saying, this is best.
[02:04:05.835 --> 02:04:10.357]  And once you are subconsciously hooked, because you've been getting truth, we're going to give you pure poison.
[02:04:11.377 --> 02:04:12.578]  Yeah, that's correct.
[02:04:12.578 --> 02:04:23.569]  And so I think that this was, you know, the censorship regime that's currently, you know, going on was actually something that was put into plan like a long time ago.
[02:04:23.569 --> 02:04:33.920]  And it's really ironic that the company that, when they IPO'd, had this mission statement of organizing the world's information and making it universally accessible and useful,
[02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:35.121]  Hold your horses.
[02:04:35.121 --> 02:04:35.541]  Start over.
[02:04:35.541 --> 02:04:36.563]  Back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:36.563 --> 02:04:36.963]  All right.
[02:04:36.963 --> 02:04:40.527]  With our guest, ladies and gentlemen, you do not want to miss this.
[02:04:40.527 --> 02:04:42.129]  Google insider blowing the whistle.
[02:04:42.129 --> 02:04:43.491]  He's done the data dump.
[02:04:43.491 --> 02:04:44.753]  What have the repercussions been?
[02:04:44.753 --> 02:04:45.734]  Where's he going now?
[02:04:45.734 --> 02:04:52.682]  We'll get to all that and, bottom of the hour, I'm giving the number out, you're gonna have an hour and a half specifically to ask him questions.
[02:04:52.682 --> 02:04:53.383]  That's why he's here.

[02:05:57.782 --> 02:06:00.403]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:00.403 --> 02:06:11.047]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:11.047 --> 02:06:17.849]  A perpetual maniac at Twitter.
[02:06:17.849 --> 02:06:23.771]  Zach Voorhees, big time Google whistleblower, in studio with us.
[02:06:23.771 --> 02:06:26.612]  And he was just talking about, if you joined us, we're going to pull the video up,
[02:06:27.442 --> 02:06:30.384]  You just told us about it.
[02:06:30.384 --> 02:06:45.751]  The head of Google, the head of Alphabet, the real spider at the center of the web, Eric Schmidt, saying eight years ago on Charlie Rhodes that, well, Google's got the most bugs of anybody because you get all these results.
[02:06:46.812 --> 02:06:49.514]  We're going to give you the one right result.
[02:06:49.514 --> 02:06:58.820]  That means whoever pays the most money for a restaurant, or for your tires, or for anything, in the final equation, it won't just be all these searches and what you like and what you visit and what you vote on.
[02:06:58.820 --> 02:07:00.762]  It'll be what we want to give you.
[02:07:00.762 --> 02:07:02.823]  And so, Google had all this on the shelf.
[02:07:02.823 --> 02:07:03.904]  It was being looked at.
[02:07:03.904 --> 02:07:08.787]  I think when Hillary lost, they got scared and accelerated the authoritarian plan.
[02:07:08.787 --> 02:07:15.532]  They were worried their own engineers and people would get upset because there was the old other maxim of not just organize the world's information to control it,
[02:07:16.292 --> 02:07:22.656]  But to also do no evil, or Google, you know, don't be evil.
[02:07:22.656 --> 02:07:32.621]  Well, I mean, now Google's real logo or real definition or real catchphrase should be, one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.
[02:07:32.621 --> 02:07:38.645]  So, Zach, you're on a roll here, and once we have that video of Schmidt, we'll play it coming up.
[02:07:38.645 --> 02:07:41.806]  But, or put it on screen when you've got it ready, thanks.
[02:07:41.806 --> 02:07:42.427]  Please continue.
[02:07:42.927 --> 02:07:49.315]  Yeah, so if someone were to say that, you know, Eric Schmidt said this, they would think you're absolutely crazy.
[02:07:49.315 --> 02:07:53.600]  But the thing is, is that we've got proof that he actually said this.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:59.146]  And so you have to just watch this video to believe that he's actually saying this.
[02:07:59.146 --> 02:08:00.347]  And by the way, for the crew.
[02:08:01.235 --> 02:08:05.076]  As information accelerates, I've gotten really OCD about info.
[02:08:05.076 --> 02:08:08.397]  Two minutes ago during break, you said, hey, go to my Twitter and grab the clip.
[02:08:08.397 --> 02:08:11.977]  They got it in a minute and a half, and I'm already like, where's the clip?
[02:08:11.977 --> 02:08:13.198]  Give me the clip right now!
[02:08:13.198 --> 02:08:15.318]  Actually, it was in my ear.
[02:08:15.318 --> 02:08:16.398]  I couldn't hear what they were saying.
[02:08:16.398 --> 02:08:18.279]  So we've got the clip.
[02:08:18.279 --> 02:08:22.940]  Here's the big spider at the bottom of the Google alphabet well.
[02:08:22.940 --> 02:08:27.061]  Sundar Pichai is just a puppet, like an anglerfish, puts a little light up there out front.
[02:08:27.061 --> 02:08:27.401]  Here he is.
[02:08:29.087 --> 02:08:35.048]  And one of my questions leading to is, help us understand where's the future of search going?
[02:08:35.048 --> 02:08:38.089]  Well, when you use Google, do you get more than one answer?
[02:08:38.089 --> 02:08:39.209]  Of course you do.
[02:08:39.209 --> 02:08:39.829]  Yeah, of course.
[02:08:39.829 --> 02:08:40.789]  Well, that's a bug.
[02:08:40.789 --> 02:08:43.170]  Yeah.
[02:08:43.170 --> 02:08:46.570]  We have more bugs per second in the world.
[02:08:46.570 --> 02:08:51.371]  Because we should be able to give you the right answer just once.
[02:08:51.371 --> 02:08:53.111]  We should know what you meant.
[02:08:53.111 --> 02:08:54.131]  You should look for information.
[02:08:54.131 --> 02:08:55.232]  We should give it exactly right.
[02:08:55.232 --> 02:08:56.752]  And we should give it to you in your language.
[02:08:58.004 --> 02:08:59.805]  And we should never be wrong.
[02:08:59.805 --> 02:09:01.987]  Okay, I've never seen that.
[02:09:01.987 --> 02:09:03.528]  It's incredibly profound.
[02:09:03.528 --> 02:09:08.952]  I knew he's made statements like it, but to see it, back it up again, I am, that actually made me dizzy.
[02:09:08.952 --> 02:09:11.514]  He's saying we're not going to give you choice.
[02:09:11.514 --> 02:09:13.495]  We're going to decide what you want.
[02:09:13.495 --> 02:09:16.237]  And now I can't search a Breitbart headline.
[02:09:16.237 --> 02:09:17.698]  I can't search an Inforce headline.
[02:09:17.698 --> 02:09:24.583]  With exact headlines, they won't come up on news, on web, on, and now Facebook blurs my face out.
[02:09:25.526 --> 02:09:28.447]  Tells people you'll be banned unless it's negative.
[02:09:28.447 --> 02:09:33.389]  So everyone is now sarcastically going, look at this scum, look at this filth, this bastard.
[02:09:33.389 --> 02:09:35.430]  He exposed Epstein, you know, 10 years ago.
[02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:37.231]  So there's some sarcasm going on.
[02:09:37.231 --> 02:09:40.272]  That's why they don't like memes, because the AI can't understand it.
[02:09:40.272 --> 02:09:42.793]  But don't worry, they've got humans looking over your shoulders.
[02:09:42.793 --> 02:09:45.434]  So Zach Voorhees, what an incredible clip.
[02:09:45.434 --> 02:09:46.495]  Yeah, what an incredible clip.
[02:09:46.495 --> 02:09:50.796]  And the fact that a lot of people, like, can we just play that clip again?
[02:09:50.796 --> 02:09:51.617]  Is that possible?
[02:09:51.617 --> 02:09:53.598]  Because it's a lot to digest.
[02:09:53.598 --> 02:09:54.158]  Yeah, here it is.
[02:09:54.158 --> 02:09:54.458]  Play it again.
[02:09:57.065 --> 02:10:02.208]  And one of my questions leading to is, help us understand where's the future of search going?
[02:10:02.208 --> 02:10:06.069]  Well, when you use Google, do you get more than one answer?
[02:10:06.069 --> 02:10:07.190]  Of course you do.
[02:10:07.190 --> 02:10:07.830]  Yeah, of course.
[02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:08.410]  Well, that's a bug.
[02:10:08.410 --> 02:10:10.851]  Yeah.
[02:10:10.851 --> 02:10:14.553]  We have more bugs per second in the world.
[02:10:14.553 --> 02:10:19.355]  Because we should be able to give you the right answer just once.
[02:10:19.355 --> 02:10:21.116]  We should know what you meant.
[02:10:21.116 --> 02:10:22.137]  You should look for information.
[02:10:22.137 --> 02:10:23.237]  We should give it exactly right.
[02:10:23.237 --> 02:10:24.738]  And we should give it to you in your language.
[02:10:25.871 --> 02:10:27.059]  And we should never be wrong.
[02:10:28.376 --> 02:10:29.197]  You should be God.
[02:10:29.197 --> 02:10:30.918]  So let me throw this out at you.
[02:10:30.918 --> 02:10:38.483]  That's like saying when you turn your radio on, you should get one song, one channel all the time because we know what you need and we're never wrong.
[02:10:38.483 --> 02:10:43.447]  Well, the whole world's about differentiating and change and finding new things and going through things.
[02:10:43.447 --> 02:10:45.508]  So you talk about the ultimate safe space.
[02:10:45.508 --> 02:10:47.450]  We give you the perfect answer always.
[02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:49.891]  Well, there is no perfect answer unless you're God.
[02:10:49.891 --> 02:10:50.952]  So they're saying we're going to play God.
[02:10:50.952 --> 02:10:55.836]  It's like saying when you go out to find your girlfriend or your wife or your husband, we're just going to tell you who it is.
[02:10:55.836 --> 02:10:56.896]  It's a programmed robot.
[02:10:57.857 --> 02:10:59.219]  This sounds like hell.
[02:10:59.219 --> 02:11:02.464]  This is like the ultimate authoritarian statement of no choice.
[02:11:02.464 --> 02:11:02.784]  Right.
[02:11:02.784 --> 02:11:08.512]  And the thing is, is that when he says, we're going to give the right answer, like what does he mean by the right answer?
[02:11:08.512 --> 02:11:11.517]  Like who makes that decision about what's right or not?
[02:11:13.581 --> 02:11:19.085]  You know, is there a bunch of social engineers that are trying to define what's right?
[02:11:19.085 --> 02:11:24.709]  And therefore, that one right answer is according to their definition of what's right.
[02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:29.193]  So he just told us, as a cult leader, what his ultimate endgame is, and now they're trying it.
[02:11:29.713 --> 02:11:41.818]  Yeah, and the thing is, is that when he mentioned this, it's like Google's mission statement to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful was in total contradiction to what he said on that Charlie Rose Show.
[02:11:41.818 --> 02:11:45.599]  And so they're saying both things at the same time, okay?
[02:11:45.599 --> 02:11:55.643]  And, you know, how are you organizing the world's information, making it, you know, accessible, if you're only returning one search result?
[02:11:55.643 --> 02:11:56.684]  One ring to bind them.
[02:11:57.719 --> 02:12:00.603]  One ring to find them, and then in the darkness find them.
[02:12:00.603 --> 02:12:00.964]  Yeah.
[02:12:00.964 --> 02:12:04.048]  He gets everybody to come to him for the power he's giving.
[02:12:04.048 --> 02:12:05.470]  That's literally Lord of the Rings.
[02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:08.956]  They all join it, and then, oh by the way, you're all my slaves now.
[02:12:08.956 --> 02:12:09.637]  There's one answer.
[02:12:11.257 --> 02:12:13.559]  We have the definition of the devil right there.
[02:12:13.559 --> 02:12:17.923]  I mean, that is like, to take free will, to take the colleges.
[02:12:17.923 --> 02:12:19.444]  Oh, the place of ultimate learning.
[02:12:19.444 --> 02:12:21.086]  Any idea can be said here.
[02:12:21.086 --> 02:12:32.556]  Now, the most orthodox, controlled, insane, mother and father is bad, expressed on Facebook, where the Republicans can't buy an ad saying, we're reaching out to strong women.
[02:12:32.556 --> 02:12:33.417]  We believe in women.
[02:12:34.306 --> 02:12:38.870]  Now the very liberal ethos is Martin Luther King they're putting down.
[02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:41.093]  They're attacking the original liberal ethos.
[02:12:41.667 --> 02:12:47.310]  Well the thing is is that I think that there's a misconception that the left is actually liberal.
[02:12:47.310 --> 02:13:08.800]  I consider myself a liberal but liberal seems to be a conservative value now because like I grew up in the 1990s I believe on judging people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin but now like with safe spaces and this like new segregation that's moving in and demonizing one race for you know the white race for all the different problems.
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:09.480]  I have a stack right
[02:13:10.561 --> 02:13:21.146]  Yeah, I mean, it's like pre-World War II Germany, you know, and it's ramping up.
[02:13:21.146 --> 02:13:23.528]  And they're like, oh, this is liberalism.
[02:13:23.528 --> 02:13:24.768]  I'm like, what?
[02:13:24.768 --> 02:13:31.352]  This is like, like, you know, the demonization of whites constantly through the New York Times, that represents liberalism?
[02:13:31.352 --> 02:13:32.172]  I don't think so.
[02:13:32.172 --> 02:13:36.975]  Liberalism means we don't judge people by their, you know, immutable characteristics.
[02:13:36.975 --> 02:13:38.176]  We judge them by what's in their head.
[02:13:39.156 --> 02:13:42.140]  And we treat everyone equally under a liberal society.
[02:13:42.140 --> 02:13:46.106]  And the left has completely abandoned that and replaced it with progressivism.
[02:13:46.106 --> 02:13:49.390]  Because they believe racial fascism will win.
[02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:49.631]  Yeah.
[02:13:50.785 --> 02:13:52.806]  I mean, they call us Nazis all day.
[02:13:52.806 --> 02:13:54.687]  They are literally funded.
[02:13:54.687 --> 02:13:57.148]  Their main funder is a Nazi collaborator.
[02:13:57.148 --> 02:13:58.229]  You can't make this up.
[02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:59.890]  Yeah, George Soros.
[02:13:59.890 --> 02:14:01.151]  There's videos of him.
[02:14:01.151 --> 02:14:09.855]  I've seen two videos now where he's talking about the exhilaration that he had sending Jews off to concentration camps.
[02:14:09.855 --> 02:14:16.459]  And what's really ironic is that if we criticize George Soros, then they call us anti-Semites.
[02:14:17.179 --> 02:14:23.472]  And it's like, we're not criticizing him because, you know, he is... We're criticizing him because he's a damn Nazi collaborator.
[02:14:23.472 --> 02:14:24.654]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:14:24.654 --> 02:14:26.498]  You know?
[02:14:26.498 --> 02:14:27.741]  But see, it's that death of logic.
[02:14:29.293 --> 02:14:31.936]  It's really sad.
[02:14:31.936 --> 02:14:35.519]  I want to have you the floor, because I'm going to tell you, you're smart, man.
[02:14:35.519 --> 02:14:43.505]  I want to get into whatever you want to cover, like inside Google without breaking any of the rules and where you think things are going, what you think Trump should do, what you've gone through since you did this.
[02:14:43.505 --> 02:14:49.771]  And as you and others have told me, there's a big resistance inside all these big tech by classical liberals that just believe in freedom.
[02:14:50.191 --> 02:14:50.892]  Yeah.
[02:14:50.892 --> 02:14:51.932]  And this isn't freedom.
[02:14:51.932 --> 02:14:53.033]  This isn't freedom.
[02:14:53.033 --> 02:14:56.415]  I mean, America is the most liberal country ever, folks.
[02:14:56.415 --> 02:14:59.537]  And Prager University has an excellent four-minute video we ought to air tomorrow.
[02:14:59.537 --> 02:15:00.077]  We don't have time.
[02:15:00.077 --> 02:15:01.278]  Everybody should Google it.
[02:15:01.278 --> 02:15:02.219]  Can't do that.
[02:15:02.219 --> 02:15:04.360]  Bing it is still bad, but not as bad as Google.
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:05.281]  They're getting worse.
[02:15:05.281 --> 02:15:07.562]  I guess dog-dog-go or duck-duck-go or whatever it is.
[02:15:07.562 --> 02:15:09.423]  Yeah, that and Startpage are really good.
[02:15:09.423 --> 02:15:10.124]  Startpage is good.
[02:15:10.124 --> 02:15:11.925]  So just look up Prager University.
[02:15:11.925 --> 02:15:12.666]  I think the headline is...
[02:15:16.736 --> 02:15:18.136]  Leftists are not liberals.
[02:15:18.136 --> 02:15:19.497]  I think it's the name of the video.
[02:15:19.497 --> 02:15:20.557]  And it's totally true.
[02:15:20.557 --> 02:15:25.598]  I've talked about it a hundred times, but the left means something totally different than liberal.
[02:15:25.598 --> 02:15:26.658]  Yeah.
[02:15:26.658 --> 02:15:27.418]  Totally different.
[02:15:27.418 --> 02:15:31.479]  They were liberals and then they got off the train as soon as they were able to win the culture war.
[02:15:31.479 --> 02:15:36.460]  And now they're just fascists.
[02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:38.581]  Corporate total dominance with government.
[02:15:38.581 --> 02:15:39.121]  Right.
[02:15:39.121 --> 02:15:44.762]  And imagine that the Antifa, the anti-fascists, are fighting people and not the big tech fascists.
[02:15:46.259 --> 02:15:46.780]  It's incredible.
[02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:49.992]  We'll be right back with our special guest Zach Voorhees on Alex Jones.

[02:16:58.990 --> 02:17:04.354]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the outleft sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.

[02:17:55.157 --> 02:17:55.317]  Yes.
[02:17:55.317 --> 02:17:55.677]  Oh, thanks.
[02:18:25.097 --> 02:18:27.679]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[02:18:27.679 --> 02:18:29.159]  I want high-quality stuff in there.
[02:18:29.159 --> 02:18:30.220]  I want a good price.
[02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:34.322]  But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[02:18:34.322 --> 02:18:36.584]  I'm making $2 on my toothpaste 50% off.
[02:18:36.584 --> 02:18:40.166]  And so it's the same thing with like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[02:18:40.166 --> 02:18:41.126]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[02:18:41.126 --> 02:18:45.329]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a lot sleeker.
[02:18:45.329 --> 02:18:53.033]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot points, we lose money.
[02:18:53.033 --> 02:18:53.654]  But that's okay.
[02:18:53.654 --> 02:18:54.274]  Thanks for the support.
[02:18:54.858 --> 02:19:08.021]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[02:19:08.021 --> 02:19:10.962]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[02:19:10.962 --> 02:19:12.702]  farming goods a week ago.
[02:19:12.702 --> 02:19:16.363]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[02:19:17.003 --> 02:19:21.564]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[02:19:21.564 --> 02:19:22.604]  That's beautiful.
[02:19:22.604 --> 02:19:24.505]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[02:19:24.505 --> 02:19:26.105]  And we aren't going to back down.
[02:19:26.105 --> 02:19:33.687]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[02:19:33.687 --> 02:19:36.028]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[02:19:36.028 --> 02:19:40.169]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:19:40.169 --> 02:19:41.109]  And I'm asking listeners,
[02:19:41.909 --> 02:19:46.033]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[02:19:46.033 --> 02:19:47.134]  We are the resistance.
[02:19:47.134 --> 02:19:58.385]  We are 1776 Worldwide!
[02:19:58.385 --> 02:20:01.028]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:26.414 --> 02:20:28.357]  All right, Zach Voorhees is here with us.
[02:20:28.357 --> 02:20:36.908]  We're having amazing discussions during the breaks and he was talking about his mission and the fact that you got these other Google engineers.
[02:20:37.745 --> 02:20:39.707]  that are being put on administrative leave.
[02:20:39.707 --> 02:20:40.668]  They're coming after folks.
[02:20:40.668 --> 02:20:43.991]  I want you to recap what you've gone through, where you are with Google right now.
[02:20:43.991 --> 02:20:49.576]  And you were saying that it doesn't matter that Google's trying to block you in cyberspace and trying to block these videos, these articles.
[02:20:49.576 --> 02:20:50.957]  And Drudge Report's been linking to them.
[02:20:50.957 --> 02:20:52.118]  DrudgeReport.com.
[02:20:52.118 --> 02:20:53.940]  But you've been doing a lot of radio and TV interviews.
[02:20:53.940 --> 02:20:54.480]  You came here.
[02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:55.902]  I mean, this is a mission.
[02:20:55.902 --> 02:20:58.244]  So just briefly describe what you did at Google.
[02:20:58.744 --> 02:21:01.825]  Why you decided to do this again for new viewers and new listeners.
[02:21:01.825 --> 02:21:03.226]  And this is really a mission.
[02:21:03.226 --> 02:21:04.527]  I mean, they're stealing our birthright.
[02:21:04.527 --> 02:21:06.448]  They're stealing our telecommunications.
[02:21:06.448 --> 02:21:16.152]  They're, in live time, I just said Carpe Donctum on Facebook isn't letting people on WhatsApp share memeworld.com, which is just a site of memes.
[02:21:16.152 --> 02:21:18.993]  I mean, it's expanding to everybody.
[02:21:18.993 --> 02:21:20.114]  These blacklists.
[02:21:20.114 --> 02:21:22.655]  Twitter is now blocking memeworld.com.
[02:21:22.655 --> 02:21:25.196]  I mean, they are so afraid of this.
[02:21:25.196 --> 02:21:26.717]  This is so dangerous.
[02:21:26.717 --> 02:21:27.237]  Please continue.
[02:21:27.897 --> 02:21:31.861]  Can I just kind of talk about what you just said with the meme wars being blocked?
[02:21:31.861 --> 02:21:34.223]  Now, a lot of people are like, what the heck is going on?
[02:21:34.223 --> 02:21:37.266]  And I want to give some comfort, okay?
[02:21:37.266 --> 02:21:41.870]  Remember what happened with the music industry and mp3s and how... Napster?
[02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:46.234]  Yeah, and what happened right before the music industry collapsed?
[02:21:46.434 --> 02:21:55.238]  They started suing everyone that was downloading MP3s, and they tried to stem the loss, and everything got really scary.
[02:21:55.238 --> 02:21:57.139]  We're like, what's happening with all of our civil rights?
[02:21:57.139 --> 02:22:03.743]  How are they able to just go in and grab all of our metadata about the things that we're downloading?
[02:22:03.743 --> 02:22:10.086]  And it looked like we were heading towards totalitarianism based off of MP3s, and then all of a sudden the industry just collapsed.
[02:22:10.546 --> 02:22:10.786]  Right?
[02:22:10.786 --> 02:22:18.331]  And so, I've heard this thing that at the very end, the last refuge of scoundrels is running to the law.
[02:22:18.331 --> 02:22:18.671]  True.
[02:22:18.671 --> 02:22:24.794]  And so, I think that what's happening is that we're at the very end of this thing.
[02:22:24.794 --> 02:22:33.640]  That's one of my list of things I wrote down this morning when I remembered, oh, he's here, is how do we fight back?
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:34.500]  Yeah.
[02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:37.002]  And at a gut level, what do you think their Achilles heels are?
[02:22:37.893 --> 02:22:45.198]  So I actually want to recommend a book called SJW's Always Lie by Vox Dei.
[02:22:45.198 --> 02:22:48.901]  That's the only book that I would recommend that someone would read.
[02:22:48.901 --> 02:22:51.923]  I don't mean to plug it, but we do sell it at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:22:51.923 --> 02:22:53.384]  That's one of the few books I've read the last year.
[02:22:53.384 --> 02:22:54.145]  I've been so busy.
[02:22:54.145 --> 02:22:55.286]  They always lie!
[02:22:55.686 --> 02:22:56.347]  They always lie.
[02:22:56.347 --> 02:23:02.992]  And the thing is, is that people that aren't familiar with the tactics, you know, because this is this is weaponized, they don't understand what's going on.
[02:23:02.992 --> 02:23:05.834]  And so they're likely to make a bunch of mistakes.
[02:23:05.834 --> 02:23:09.277]  They think that they just capitulate and like apologize.
[02:23:09.277 --> 02:23:10.598]  Then it's just going to go away.
[02:23:10.598 --> 02:23:10.878]  Oh, no.
[02:23:10.878 --> 02:23:14.120]  A few years ago, I'm like, well, I'm not really saying that about Sandy Hook.
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:17.083]  But if you say I'm hurting you and sending people to your house, I never did that.
[02:23:17.083 --> 02:23:18.264]  But I apologize.
[02:23:18.264 --> 02:23:20.085]  That's when they just full metal attacked.
[02:23:20.165 --> 02:23:21.126]  Yeah, they doubled down.
[02:23:21.126 --> 02:23:28.530]  And the thing is, is that they're going to parade your apology around and say, well, you know, he admits to this, that he's like X, Y, or Z bad person.
[02:23:28.530 --> 02:23:30.792]  And then they're going to use that and they're going to parade it around.
[02:23:30.792 --> 02:23:34.134]  And this is not something that people like understand intuitively.
[02:23:34.134 --> 02:23:41.259]  And so the thing is, is that, you know, get this book, SJWs Always Lie by Vox Dei and read it.
[02:23:41.259 --> 02:23:43.941]  It's a fascinating read and it goes by really quickly.
[02:23:44.981 --> 02:23:49.704]  And, um, it's kind of a funny title, but it... The point is, stop capitulating, stop kissing their ass.
[02:23:49.704 --> 02:23:51.145]  Yes, exactly, exactly.
[02:23:51.145 --> 02:23:52.226]  Because I knew not to capitulate.
[02:23:52.226 --> 02:23:55.028]  It's a political structure, but I'm like, oh, the families.
[02:23:55.028 --> 02:23:58.790]  I didn't really do this, but if this is really happening, I'm sorry.
[02:23:58.790 --> 02:24:04.274]  And then they just all go out with talking points and then just attack, attack, attack, attack, attack.
[02:24:04.414 --> 02:24:11.522]  Yeah, so I followed this book basically as a tactical operation manual on how I was going to leak this information.
[02:24:11.522 --> 02:24:12.804]  But let's go back.
[02:24:12.804 --> 02:24:15.166]  What exactly did I do at YouTube?
[02:24:15.166 --> 02:24:20.372]  What I did at YouTube was I was a senior software engineer and I... Hey, let's get you on with Vox Day tomorrow.
[02:24:20.372 --> 02:24:21.233]  You're still here tomorrow.
[02:24:21.233 --> 02:24:22.014]  I am still here tomorrow.
[02:24:22.014 --> 02:24:23.176]  Can we get Vox Day on with him tomorrow?
[02:24:24.298 --> 02:24:25.258]  Great, awesome.
[02:24:25.258 --> 02:24:26.179]  Yeah, it's wonderful.
[02:24:26.179 --> 02:24:26.999]  Keep going, I apologize.
[02:24:26.999 --> 02:24:38.923]  So, if anyone turns on, like, the television, or, you know, PlayStation 4, or Xbox, or Nintendo Switch, and they see the embedded version of YouTube playing on their television, that's the app that I was working on.
[02:24:38.923 --> 02:24:48.327]  And when I left YouTube, when I resigned, that app constituted 10% of YouTube's entire traffic.
[02:24:48.327 --> 02:24:48.867]  Wow.
[02:24:48.867 --> 02:24:49.748]  So, yeah.
[02:24:49.748 --> 02:24:52.649]  Well, sure, because I had other big engineers on, they call Singer, and they go, oh no,
[02:24:53.789 --> 02:24:56.210]  No, Zach's the big kahuna.
[02:24:56.210 --> 02:24:58.812]  You are the biggest person to defect from Google.
[02:24:58.812 --> 02:25:01.853]  Yeah, I am.
[02:25:01.853 --> 02:25:05.375]  And so, that was my role at Google.
[02:25:05.375 --> 02:25:08.077]  I've been at Google for eight years.
[02:25:08.077 --> 02:25:13.720]  And then the last three, that's when everything was turning into clown world.
[02:25:13.720 --> 02:25:17.062]  And so, I decided that, you know,
[02:25:17.622 --> 02:25:17.742]  Okay.
[02:25:37.068 --> 02:25:39.389]  Good to go.
[02:26:00.785 --> 02:26:03.127]  Or we can cliffhanger it and come back.
[02:26:03.127 --> 02:26:04.968]  It's a hard area.
[02:26:04.968 --> 02:26:07.110]  You know, a year ago we didn't have the term fake news.
[02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:08.611]  Now everything is about fake news.
[02:26:08.611 --> 02:26:10.492]  We hear about it every single day.
[02:26:10.492 --> 02:26:15.516]  It's had a lot of concerns about how it affected the election, how it affects politics.
[02:26:15.516 --> 02:26:16.537]  News is important to us.
[02:26:16.897 --> 02:26:19.698]  We are a platform with global distribution.
[02:26:19.698 --> 02:26:22.020]  We talked about the number of users that are coming to us.
[02:26:22.020 --> 02:26:28.423]  We have some responsibility to make sure that we are delivering the news when something important happens in the world, when there's a crisis.
[02:26:28.423 --> 02:26:30.244]  We think people could benefit from this news.
[02:26:30.244 --> 02:26:33.205]  So news has always been important to YouTube.
[02:26:33.205 --> 02:26:43.551]  We also see people in locations like Syria, where traditional news organizations can't get to, and people are talking about citizen journalism coming out of Syria.
[02:26:43.551 --> 02:26:44.231]  So what are we doing?
[02:26:47.062 --> 02:26:49.224]  This sounds easy, but it's really hard to do.
[02:26:49.224 --> 02:26:55.570]  We're pushing down the fake news, we're demoting it, and we are increasing the authoritative news and promoting it.
[02:26:55.570 --> 02:26:56.871]  How do we do that?
[02:26:56.871 --> 02:27:06.399]  We have a whole system, we came up with Trashy News, where we have build classifiers, we identify it, we look for salacious, for clickbait, content that isn't, that we don't think is
[02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:12.005]  You know, the authoritative news, it's just kind of encouraging people to look at, but it's not true.
[02:27:12.005 --> 02:27:23.838]  We're training, we added these instructions to our readers and we've updated our classifiers and we are working to understand, identify that with machine learning and then to push that down.
[02:27:23.838 --> 02:27:25.940]  And then we're increasing our authoritative news.
[02:27:25.940 --> 02:27:28.443]  We're doing that with things like a breaking news shelf.
[02:27:28.823 --> 02:27:30.505]  Oh yeah, they covered up that Muslims did that.
[02:27:48.291 --> 02:27:50.732]  We're also working with a lot more news publishers.
[02:27:50.732 --> 02:27:53.754]  News publishers don't want to be in the technical business of running their own player.
[02:27:53.754 --> 02:27:55.515]  We can do that for them.
[02:27:55.515 --> 02:27:57.616]  And we also want to get more news players on the platform.
[02:27:57.616 --> 02:28:02.159]  We have the goal of getting over 100 new news providers on our platform this year.
[02:28:03.419 --> 02:28:13.805]  So what's really interesting is that, you know, this dream event happened and I heard her, you know, say those words and I recorded that video to leak it to the public so that they could see what was going on.
[02:28:13.805 --> 02:28:14.725]  That was an internal?
[02:28:14.725 --> 02:28:16.526]  That was an internal event.
[02:28:16.526 --> 02:28:20.669]  It was kind of open to public insiders, but it was mostly for the employees.
[02:28:21.949 --> 02:28:26.450]  And I started to ask myself, well what exactly do they think fake news is?
[02:28:26.450 --> 02:28:36.253]  And so I found their fake news like definitions in their design documents and it turned out that real events were being labeled as fake news.
[02:28:36.253 --> 02:28:42.415]  Let's come back and talk about Google labeled real events fake news with insider Zach Voorhees.
[02:28:43.075 --> 02:28:51.420]  He resigned from Google and is now taking action in a big way and then I'll get the number out and your phone calls are coming up on the other side.
[02:28:53.979 --> 02:29:05.161]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:05.161 --> 02:29:14.483]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:29:14.483 --> 02:29:19.544]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[02:29:19.764 --> 02:29:23.968]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location.
[02:29:23.968 --> 02:29:31.957]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[02:29:31.957 --> 02:29:33.218]  So here's what you should do right now.
[02:29:33.218 --> 02:29:37.503]  Check out the PPX Microgrid system at MyOwnPowerGrid.com.
[02:29:37.503 --> 02:29:39.745]  That's MyOwnPowerGrid.com.

[02:29:43.850 --> 02:29:44.511]  And the best part?
[02:29:44.511 --> 02:29:45.713]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500, $300 or even $200.
[02:29:45.713 --> 02:29:47.115]  Go to MyOwnPowerGrid.com to learn more.

[02:29:54.741 --> 02:30:07.934]  Thomas Jefferson predicted, over 240 years ago, that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[02:30:07.934 --> 02:30:10.837]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[02:30:10.837 --> 02:30:16.262]  farming goods a week ago, and we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[02:30:16.883 --> 02:30:21.448]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[02:30:21.448 --> 02:30:22.468]  That's beautiful.
[02:30:22.468 --> 02:30:24.390]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[02:30:24.390 --> 02:30:25.992]  And we aren't going to back down.
[02:30:25.992 --> 02:30:33.579]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[02:30:33.579 --> 02:30:35.921]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[02:30:35.921 --> 02:30:40.085]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:30:40.085 --> 02:30:41.026]  And I'm asking listeners,

[02:32:04.863 --> 02:32:08.947]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:32:08.947 --> 02:32:13.592]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[02:32:13.592 --> 02:32:16.756]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[02:32:16.756 --> 02:32:17.837]  It's a form of fascism.
[02:32:18.886 --> 02:32:22.468]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[02:32:22.468 --> 02:32:33.795]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[02:32:33.795 --> 02:32:35.656]  First, they come for Alex Jones.
[02:32:35.656 --> 02:32:45.422]  Everyone else, like Davos, would fall.
[02:32:45.422 --> 02:32:46.643]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:32:49.346 --> 02:32:51.347]  You can't watch this, the movie.
[02:32:51.347 --> 02:32:57.811]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:57.811 --> 02:33:11.738]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:11.738 --> 02:33:15.560]  Man, this Zack Orton just acts just like me behind the scenes.
[02:33:17.062 --> 02:33:19.543]  He's like running in there to have them pull up documents.
[02:33:19.543 --> 02:33:22.384]  He's like, relax Zack, we got plenty of time.
[02:33:22.384 --> 02:33:24.485]  I got a plug anyways or we won't be here.
[02:33:24.485 --> 02:33:31.589]  I'm not funded by the big mega banks and the Federal Reserve, the New World Order, and all the rest of it.
[02:33:31.589 --> 02:33:35.390]  We had that big store-wide sale, 50 to 60% off.
[02:33:35.390 --> 02:33:36.291]  I had to end that sale.
[02:33:37.364 --> 02:33:37.524]  I'm good.
[02:33:54.514 --> 02:33:55.375]  Plus lots of other deals.
[02:33:55.375 --> 02:33:56.696]  50-60% off.
[02:33:56.696 --> 02:34:02.321]  That means we're making like 20-30% on it, but we sell a lot and we do it, so that's what works.
[02:34:02.321 --> 02:34:14.651]  And whether you get your fluoride-free toothpaste, or your Great Wake of America coffee, or fish oil, or turmeric, things you want to reorder, or the nootropic brain force, sign up for AutoShip every month, every two months, every three months.

[02:34:42.552 --> 02:34:42.972]  All right.
[02:34:58.962 --> 02:35:05.248]  I already had it being designed, but then I saw Chris Pratt wearing a Don't Tread on Me with a Gadsden Snake with the Betsy Ross, and I'm like, that's genius.
[02:35:05.248 --> 02:35:07.310]  Shall we change it to that?
[02:35:07.310 --> 02:35:08.631]  That shirt is almost sold out.
[02:35:08.631 --> 02:35:13.216]  So is the last run of the Space Force Space Shuttle.
[02:35:13.216 --> 02:35:15.878]  It's a symbol of humans moving to the next level.
[02:35:15.878 --> 02:35:16.839]  Very triggering to the left.
[02:35:16.839 --> 02:35:18.321]  Big red, white, and blue flag.
[02:35:18.321 --> 02:35:19.462]  Designer shirt.
[02:35:19.462 --> 02:35:20.883]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:35:21.784 --> 02:35:22.224]  Or 888-253-3139.
[02:35:22.224 --> 02:35:27.626]  And I don't want to just sit here and celebrate this, but we should celebrate it.
[02:35:27.626 --> 02:35:37.449]  The fact that a major Google engineer, who is running 10% of YouTube's traffic alone with one thing he did, has come out with the big Ed Snowden-level data dump.
[02:35:38.702 --> 02:35:47.786]  It takes a lot of courage, and the fact that he's busting his butt going around giving speeches, going on shows, coming on this broadcast as one of the first shows, really is amazing.
[02:35:47.786 --> 02:35:54.649]  And it's the spirit that's infectious that needs to trigger more people to say, I'm not going to be part of this cult.
[02:35:54.649 --> 02:35:58.670]  Because if you think the brainwashing in the general public's bad, I've heard it's really bad in big tech.
[02:35:58.670 --> 02:36:00.551]  And I know you want to get into documents.
[02:36:00.551 --> 02:36:01.972]  You want to get into proof of all this.
[02:36:01.972 --> 02:36:04.133]  I'm going to give the number out so people can call in as well.
[02:36:04.133 --> 02:36:06.674]  We've still got you for another hour and 20 minutes or so.
[02:36:08.221 --> 02:36:18.853]  Specifically, we should be writing notes here, there's so much to get into, about the cult inside, and the mindset, and are they really micro-dosing, and we'll hit that next segment.
[02:36:18.853 --> 02:36:24.259]  But let me give the number out, specifically where we have hundreds of radio affiliates.
[02:36:24.259 --> 02:36:26.341]  We still have Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:36:26.341 --> 02:36:27.763]  We still have millions of people.
[02:36:28.627 --> 02:36:32.690]  A day to come and click the audio, and watch the video live.
[02:36:32.690 --> 02:36:42.816]  Despite everything they've done, in some ways we're more important than ever, because now the really big thinkers are tuned in, once they heard they weren't supposed to listen to the show, but if you'll just spread Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:36:42.816 --> 02:36:46.538]  And that's censored, I know, so do Newswars.com forward slash show, it's not censored.
[02:36:46.538 --> 02:36:52.742]  Gosh, meme world, they're so scared of that, it's censored, day one it got launched, but word of mouth, you can say, psst, hey, we're all Spartacus, hey.
[02:36:53.422 --> 02:36:54.142]  We're good to go.
[02:37:10.029 --> 02:37:11.950]  I'm going to say his last name or they've already doxxed him.
[02:37:11.950 --> 02:37:13.550]  So there's a lot of exciting things.
[02:37:13.550 --> 02:37:16.071]  So they're directly blocking the Senate leader.
[02:37:16.071 --> 02:37:20.272]  They're directly blocking Trump when they block Carpe D'Antem.
[02:37:20.272 --> 02:37:21.553]  Look, the enemy knows that.
[02:37:21.553 --> 02:37:23.033]  I'm not giving you secrets.
[02:37:23.033 --> 02:37:25.414]  But they have reached a new arrogance level.
[02:37:26.206 --> 02:37:33.909]  Where they tell you they're not censoring, and they're doing it in live time, and lying to the President's face, and he says, strong action, we'll talk about what that strong action should be.
[02:37:33.909 --> 02:37:39.191]  So 877-789-2539, only this topic, folks, please.
[02:37:39.191 --> 02:37:48.855]  877-789-ALEX, 877-789-ALEX, first time you're going to be able to directly talk to a high-level Google engineer that left and has spilt the beans like no one ever else has done.
[02:37:48.855 --> 02:37:50.415]  877-789-2539 on this live, Wednesday, global transmission.
[02:37:55.197 --> 02:37:56.698]  Please continue, Mr. Voorhees.
[02:37:56.698 --> 02:38:02.120]  Right, so where we left off before the break was, you know, the issue of fake news.
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:12.744]  And we had, you know, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wachowski, talking about how they were going to take fake news and suppress it, and that they were going to start boosting authoritative news.
[02:38:12.744 --> 02:38:17.866]  And so the question that I had was, what exactly is fake news?
[02:38:17.866 --> 02:38:20.147]  And so... It's whatever Eric Smith says it is.
[02:38:20.427 --> 02:38:20.867]  Right.
[02:38:20.867 --> 02:38:29.411]  And so, you know, they had a document available to all the full-time employees that defined what fake news was.
[02:38:29.411 --> 02:38:38.435]  And so I want to sort of show you that one of the things that was in this fake news, as an example, was actually something that happened.
[02:38:38.435 --> 02:38:44.438]  Which is, you know, the evidence that, okay, they are intending to become social engineers.
[02:38:47.319 --> 02:38:52.469]  This is part of the document dump that was released through Project Veritas.
[02:38:52.469 --> 02:38:57.678]  If the audience wants to look at this, they can go to Project Veritas and download this.
[02:38:58.604 --> 02:39:03.488]  This is called the Training Global Google Efforts to Address Fake News.
[02:39:03.488 --> 02:39:06.890]  And so on page five, there's this document here.
[02:39:06.890 --> 02:39:17.118]  And if you look at the second example, and that is, Wikileaks confirms Hillary sold weapons to ISIS, then drops another bombshell breaking news.
[02:39:17.118 --> 02:39:18.338]  Okay?
[02:39:18.338 --> 02:39:21.221]  And then the second one is something similar.
[02:39:21.221 --> 02:39:24.843]  Hillary's ISIS email just leaked and it's worse than anyone could have imagined.
[02:39:26.721 --> 02:39:31.823]  Hillary Clinton was running weapons to ISIS through Benghazi.
[02:39:31.823 --> 02:39:33.083]  That's now been in Congress.
[02:39:33.083 --> 02:39:34.163]  Yeah, that's been in Congress.
[02:39:34.163 --> 02:39:38.585]  That was a conspiracy theory, now it's a conspiracy fact.
[02:39:38.585 --> 02:39:42.946]  And the social engineers are classifying that as fake news.
[02:39:43.766 --> 02:39:59.449]  Okay, and which means that what they want to do is they want to start training their AI algorithms to find that and all the patterns that are similar to that and de-rank it because they don't want, for some reason, they don't want bad news about Hillary Clinton surfacing.
[02:39:59.449 --> 02:40:04.030]  Well, we know from the WikiLeaks, Hillary's on the phone with the media and Google bitching.
[02:40:04.030 --> 02:40:10.812]  It's almost like Hillary-centric because she had so much power as kind of the shadow president with Obama, but he watched, he would watch SportsCenter.
[02:40:10.812 --> 02:40:12.192]  She was actually on the phone all day
[02:40:12.992 --> 02:40:16.694]  It's in WikiLeaks, bitching at Google saying, hide this, hide that.
[02:40:16.694 --> 02:40:17.974]  So much of it is Hillary.
[02:40:17.974 --> 02:40:34.202]  Yeah, and so I created a Medium post, an article, that describes, you know, kind of like the main way that Google was able to influence the 2016 election by hiding information about Hillary Clinton.
[02:40:34.202 --> 02:40:36.203]  And this is the whole reason you came here today, so I'm glad
[02:40:37.205 --> 02:40:37.585]  Yeah.
[02:40:37.585 --> 02:40:40.006]  Is there a way we can pull this article up?
[02:40:40.006 --> 02:40:40.127]  Right.
[02:40:53.447 --> 02:41:08.170]  And so, the way that Google was able to influence the election is that they were deleting the search prediction results when people were trying to find information about Hillary Clinton.
[02:41:08.170 --> 02:41:15.071]  Now the thing is, is that a lot of people went on and, you know, were searching for the Clinton body count.
[02:41:15.071 --> 02:41:19.992]  Because there's a lot of people that have died, you know, related to Hillary Clinton.
[02:41:19.992 --> 02:41:20.872]  Like Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:41:21.132 --> 02:41:31.575]  Yeah, and it's all been catalogued, and it's all been, you know, and some of them, you know, they were listed as suicides, but they died through two gunshots to the back of the head.
[02:41:31.575 --> 02:41:47.780]  And so, you know, that information is out there, it's been catalogued, people can, were able to find it, but what was happening is that when people would go and try to type in, like, Hillary Clinton body count, Google, the Google search prediction was shut off.
[02:41:48.903 --> 02:42:01.077]  And the thing is, is that if you went and searched for, example, Trump body count, that search result prediction was suggested to the user.
[02:42:01.077 --> 02:42:07.303]  And the thing is, is that Google says that their search prediction feature is based off of user data.
[02:42:07.924 --> 02:42:18.627]  Now, I was able to use Google's own services at trends.google.com to show the real search traffic for this search term and show that Google was lying.
[02:42:18.627 --> 02:42:22.608]  So either Google is lying through one service or they're lying through the other.
[02:42:22.608 --> 02:42:24.909]  And either way, they're both lying.
[02:42:24.909 --> 02:42:25.849]  You've got all the graphics.
[02:42:25.849 --> 02:42:26.749]  It's in the article.
[02:42:26.749 --> 02:42:28.410]  You've got the floor when we come back.
[02:42:28.410 --> 02:42:29.670]  I want to walk through this.
[02:42:30.270 --> 02:42:35.455]  For the President and for Congress and everybody, how this works, how they do it and how you can see it.
[02:42:35.455 --> 02:42:38.818]  And then what is it where we have an exact headline and it won't show up?
[02:42:38.818 --> 02:42:43.742]  Because that's this new thing they're doing, where stuff is totally put into the Phantom Zone.
[02:42:43.742 --> 02:42:47.846]  Zach Voorhees, the biggest Google whistleblower ever, is our guest.
[02:42:47.846 --> 02:42:52.490]  We'll talk about hopefully more whistleblowers coming forward, what he's hoping to trigger, and your phone call.
[02:42:52.490 --> 02:42:52.891]  Stay with us.
[02:42:53.632 --> 02:43:06.825]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[02:43:06.825 --> 02:43:09.728]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[02:43:09.728 --> 02:43:11.490]  farming goods a week ago.
[02:43:11.490 --> 02:43:15.133]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[02:43:15.774 --> 02:43:20.339]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[02:43:20.339 --> 02:43:21.359]  That's beautiful.
[02:43:21.359 --> 02:43:23.261]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[02:43:23.261 --> 02:43:24.863]  And we aren't going to back down.
[02:43:24.863 --> 02:43:32.470]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[02:43:32.470 --> 02:43:34.812]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[02:43:34.812 --> 02:43:38.976]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:43:38.976 --> 02:43:39.897]  And I'm asking listeners,
[02:43:40.698 --> 02:43:44.808]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[02:43:44.808 --> 02:43:45.910]  We are the resistance.
[02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:46.552]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[02:43:54.321 --> 02:43:56.282]  Robert Marantz, what has Big Tech become?
[02:43:56.282 --> 02:43:58.302]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[02:43:58.302 --> 02:44:04.824]  And the way they did so is because they faced no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[02:44:04.824 --> 02:44:16.888]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[02:44:16.888 --> 02:44:18.068]  Otherwise, they will never change.
[02:44:18.348 --> 02:44:20.710]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[02:44:48.292 --> 02:44:50.078]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[02:44:50.078 --> 02:44:52.006]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[02:44:52.006 --> 02:44:53.270]  Even it is what you just saw.
[02:44:55.310 --> 02:44:57.732]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[02:44:57.732 --> 02:45:01.195]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[02:45:01.195 --> 02:45:02.737]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[02:45:02.737 --> 02:45:04.058]  I want to take the gloveless on.
[02:45:04.058 --> 02:45:06.019]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[02:45:06.019 --> 02:45:11.204]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[02:45:11.204 --> 02:45:14.147]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[02:45:14.147 --> 02:45:14.887]  We got coffee.
[02:45:14.887 --> 02:45:15.768]  We got fish oil.
[02:45:15.768 --> 02:45:16.549]  We got turmeric.
[02:45:16.549 --> 02:45:17.530]  We got great toothpaste.
[02:45:17.530 --> 02:45:19.932]  We've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[02:45:19.932 --> 02:45:22.374]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[02:45:22.674 --> 02:45:25.175]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[02:45:25.175 --> 02:45:35.799]  It's totally full of the bottle, and it is the strongest, purest krill oil, and it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[02:45:35.799 --> 02:45:41.581]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[02:45:41.581 --> 02:45:43.842]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[02:45:43.842 --> 02:45:44.462]  This is not real.
[02:45:44.782 --> 02:45:49.385]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere.
[02:45:49.385 --> 02:45:50.945]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[02:45:50.945 --> 02:45:51.686]  It's not yellow.
[02:45:51.686 --> 02:45:52.586]  It's not milky.
[02:45:52.586 --> 02:45:56.028]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[02:45:56.028 --> 02:46:12.557]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[02:46:12.697 --> 02:46:16.780]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[02:46:16.780 --> 02:46:20.462]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[02:46:20.462 --> 02:46:22.223]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:46:22.223 --> 02:46:26.446]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[02:46:26.446 --> 02:46:34.371]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been to the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[02:46:34.411 --> 02:46:35.651]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:14.509 --> 02:47:22.377]  I'm going to teach you what censorship's all about and how if we're going to have a free society, we've got to stop it.
[02:47:22.377 --> 02:47:29.123]  Zach Voorhees is our guest, and he was just getting into his Medium article that we've reposted at Infowars.com.
[02:47:29.123 --> 02:47:36.010]  Google Insider exposes how tech giant is fixing the search results, hiding the Clinton death count.
[02:47:36.590 --> 02:47:38.132]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:47:38.132 --> 02:47:39.955]  It's up on Newswars.com.
[02:47:39.955 --> 02:47:41.537]  You definitely want to share that.
[02:47:41.537 --> 02:47:44.701]  That'll make folks at Google and Twitter and Facebook think that you're done.
[02:47:44.701 --> 02:47:46.343]  Think that they can pull this.
[02:47:46.343 --> 02:47:53.333]  You know, are they pulling this massive censorship and exercise of social engineering because they're desperate or because they're arrogant?
[02:47:55.203 --> 02:47:57.885]  Um, I think that it's actually both.
[02:47:57.885 --> 02:48:04.109]  They've elected themselves as the autocrats to decide what is true and what is not.
[02:48:04.109 --> 02:48:07.972]  And that's what we're facing with right now.
[02:48:07.972 --> 02:48:12.174]  And the thing is, is that I'm not entirely sure that the executives are really running the company.
[02:48:12.174 --> 02:48:18.459]  I suspect that there might be someone above them operating from the shadows, you know, operating through the executives.
[02:48:19.284 --> 02:48:29.970]  And then they ordered them to bring in all the Southern Property Law Center 100,000 trainees who then, on their off time as you exposed, they have the back doors Google gave them and then they go in and do the sabotage.
[02:48:29.970 --> 02:48:35.474]  And then when we caught them last year, even Bloomberg said, oh, our employees weren't trained and some other people got in.
[02:48:35.474 --> 02:48:36.674]  Yeah.
[02:48:36.674 --> 02:48:37.075]  Yeah.
[02:48:37.075 --> 02:48:45.720]  And the thing is, is that I've noticed this pattern of insiders being able to hack Google's systems because I saw how they took down Jordan B. Peterson.
[02:48:46.741 --> 02:48:48.824]  And you witness that, and here's the thing.
[02:48:48.824 --> 02:48:51.427]  Obviously something this powerful is going to get abused.
[02:48:51.427 --> 02:48:54.351]  I'm surprised Google didn't do more abuse up until Hillary lost.
[02:48:54.351 --> 02:48:56.433]  I mean, this is damn powerful!
[02:48:56.433 --> 02:48:57.775]  And so, it's going to get abused.
[02:48:59.488 --> 02:49:23.597]  Yeah, well the thing is is that the establishment was in power in the United States and so they didn't really need to apply all of this control because they had control and it was when they started to lose control was when the mask got ripped off and as a result now we're seeing what they truly are and it's a really nasty ugly beast that is fighting for its life I think?
[02:49:23.597 --> 02:49:25.558]  I mean that's what it sounds like to me is that
[02:49:26.158 --> 02:49:31.811]  You know, from their behavior that they're really, you know, in a total war situation for the American mind.
[02:49:32.665 --> 02:49:36.168]  Big Tech is in a total war for the American mind.
[02:49:36.168 --> 02:49:37.049]  Google Insider.
[02:49:37.049 --> 02:49:38.851]  There's the name of the whole interview.
[02:49:38.851 --> 02:49:44.776]  And we put that clip you just said right up front because that's the thing is this is so epic and so real.
[02:49:44.776 --> 02:49:47.779]  China about to invade Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[02:49:47.779 --> 02:49:49.781]  India going into Kashmir.
[02:49:49.781 --> 02:49:51.362]  All these geopolitical moves.
[02:49:51.362 --> 02:49:54.745]  The Washington Post saying Xi will defeat Trump and save America.
[02:49:54.745 --> 02:49:55.846]  There's the headline.
[02:49:55.846 --> 02:49:58.209]  I mean, we're living like in a comic book.
[02:50:00.828 --> 02:50:03.328]  Movie right now this is that really the headline.
[02:50:03.328 --> 02:50:08.149]  Yeah, oh my Wow Can can we show this to the yeah?
[02:50:08.149 --> 02:50:28.693]  Because it says it but then if you read what it says it's saying she must crush Trump or America will be in trouble It's it's like it's like how much more of a clown will like when I see this I'm like they can't get any worse than what it is and it's just now we've got now we've got the media rooting for our foreign adversary unbelievable one of my
[02:50:30.106 --> 02:50:34.027]  Oldest, he may be the oldest employee here.
[02:50:34.027 --> 02:50:34.887]  17 plus years.
[02:50:34.887 --> 02:50:40.149]  His sister won't bring the grandkids over to see his mom in Minnesota.
[02:50:40.149 --> 02:50:45.330]  And his mom's great and she had a great relationship because she's a Trump supporter and she won't even really talk to him now.
[02:50:45.330 --> 02:50:51.251]  And she says, she told me this morning, he was like, he goes, you know, she says white people are inherently bad and will be better once they're all gone.
[02:50:51.251 --> 02:50:53.792]  And, and that basically, you know, that
[02:50:55.539 --> 02:50:57.960]  And he's like, he's like, honey, that's evil.
[02:50:57.960 --> 02:50:59.040]  And she's just gone.
[02:50:59.040 --> 02:50:59.840]  Yeah, gone.
[02:50:59.840 --> 02:51:00.520]  Yeah.
[02:51:00.520 --> 02:51:03.241]  I mean, this is so we sit here and laugh at this.
[02:51:03.241 --> 02:51:04.861]  This is real programming.
[02:51:04.861 --> 02:51:07.062]  I mean, yeah, this is working on some people.
[02:51:07.062 --> 02:51:09.102]  And there's a slide and I don't have it in front of me.
[02:51:09.102 --> 02:51:12.203]  But Google admits that, you know, there's a four step process.
[02:51:12.203 --> 02:51:14.624]  And the last step is that people are programmed.
[02:51:14.624 --> 02:51:16.144]  That's their words.
[02:51:16.144 --> 02:51:16.344]  Okay.
[02:51:16.344 --> 02:51:17.865]  And it didn't just end up in one slide.
[02:51:17.865 --> 02:51:22.526]  It ended up in two slides that I saw in different PowerPoint presentations.
[02:51:23.366 --> 02:51:26.190]  I should just be saying, what shocked you most?
[02:51:26.190 --> 02:51:27.651]  What was the process?
[02:51:27.651 --> 02:51:34.339]  Eight years, you become one of their top engineers, from a junior engineer, and you're just looking at this versus what's on the news.
[02:51:34.339 --> 02:51:37.743]  You're inside seeing the truth, and then you're seeing what they're saying on the news.
[02:51:38.183 --> 02:51:59.922]  Right, like I remember sitting at my desk listening to testimony by I think it was one of the executives saying that we don't employ blacklists and so I just go to the internal search engine called MoMA and I search for blacklists and up pops this huge 42 or 40 page blacklist for YouTube and I'm just like I'm like
[02:52:02.163 --> 02:52:08.426]  The lies are just so in your face that it's just ridiculous.
[02:52:08.426 --> 02:52:09.587]  It needs to be confronted.
[02:52:09.587 --> 02:52:11.788]  It needs to be exposed.
[02:52:11.788 --> 02:52:14.329]  So I want to talk about this Clinton body count.
[02:52:14.329 --> 02:52:15.630]  Yeah, please.
[02:52:15.630 --> 02:52:29.637]  And before I talk about Clinton, I wanted to let the audience members know that I am not suicidal and that I have no plans of killing myself or overdosing on drugs because I don't do that.
[02:52:29.957 --> 02:52:31.178]  By the way, you're not being a wimp here.
[02:52:31.178 --> 02:52:40.388]  I've had known high-level CIA operatives that ran assassination of government leaders call up and say, you better watch it, you better shut up if you care about your family.
[02:52:40.388 --> 02:52:43.471]  So I've been death-threatened by famous CIA people.
[02:52:43.471 --> 02:52:45.213]  Right, I mean... So, I mean, this is real.
[02:52:45.213 --> 02:52:45.653]  This is real.
[02:52:45.653 --> 02:52:46.274]  This is real.
[02:52:46.274 --> 02:52:52.340]  Even Dr. Robert Epstein just, like, made an announcement today that he's not suicidal because he just got into a fight with Hillary Clinton on Twitter.
[02:52:52.540 --> 02:52:54.001]  Oh yeah, that article's on Infowars.
[02:52:54.001 --> 02:52:55.622]  It's the most evil photo of Hillary.
[02:52:55.622 --> 02:52:56.703]  And there's a bunch.
[02:52:56.703 --> 02:52:58.524]  I meant to start the show with that.
[02:52:58.524 --> 02:52:59.765]  That's why there's so much info.
[02:52:59.765 --> 02:53:03.527]  And it's like Epstein says, Epstein has fight with Hillary.
[02:53:03.527 --> 02:53:08.490]  And there's a photo of him with her when she's the most demonic looking joker I've ever seen.
[02:53:08.490 --> 02:53:09.031]  Yeah.
[02:53:09.031 --> 02:53:09.871]  We're going to fight.
[02:53:09.871 --> 02:53:11.652]  I can't look at this photo.
[02:53:11.652 --> 02:53:12.693]  It is haunting.
[02:53:12.693 --> 02:53:14.234]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:53:14.234 --> 02:53:15.735]  Sorry, get into it.
[02:53:15.735 --> 02:53:20.278]  So let's talk about how Google suppressed the autocomplete for the Clinton body count.
[02:53:22.139 --> 02:53:23.806]  So this is a Medium article that I wrote.
[02:53:23.806 --> 02:53:26.556]  Can we put it up on the screen?
[02:53:26.556 --> 02:53:27.239]  We'll put Medium up.
[02:53:28.499 --> 02:53:43.802]  Um, and so, when someone goes to Google search, and they type in, for example, Trump body, the letter C, what they'll get is a suggestion, you know, do you mean Trump body count?
[02:53:43.802 --> 02:53:43.942]  Right?
[02:53:43.942 --> 02:53:47.442]  By the way, you host, I'm going to go in there and get the medium pulled up, because I know you want the medium specifically.
[02:53:47.442 --> 02:53:49.783]  We need to scroll down into the actual things.
[02:53:49.783 --> 02:53:51.583]  You can show them the PowerPoint.
[02:53:51.583 --> 02:53:52.383]  I'll be right back.
[02:53:52.383 --> 02:53:53.683]  Alright.
[02:53:53.683 --> 02:53:56.004]  Um, I'll just send it to production.
[02:53:57.044 --> 02:54:01.846]  Um, yeah, so, um, there's this, oh yeah, there we go.
[02:54:01.846 --> 02:54:07.309]  So, there's this, there's this article that I wrote, um, and if, uh...
[02:54:08.752 --> 02:54:13.894]  And if you type in Trump Body See, it auto-completes to Trump Body Count.
[02:54:13.894 --> 02:54:21.498]  And now if we try the same thing for Clinton Body See, nothing auto-completes at all.
[02:54:21.498 --> 02:54:24.379]  The search results are omitted.
[02:54:24.379 --> 02:54:32.783]  And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to ask the audience at home to go to Google Search and try this right now.
[02:54:32.783 --> 02:54:33.303]  Okay?
[02:54:33.303 --> 02:54:34.044]  Go to Google Search.
[02:54:35.051 --> 02:54:43.573]  Type in Trump Body C with spaces in between them, and you'll see that it auto-completes the Trump body count.
[02:54:43.573 --> 02:54:50.915]  Now try the same thing with the Clinton body count, and no search result will exist.
[02:54:50.915 --> 02:54:51.655]  Okay?
[02:54:51.655 --> 02:54:53.856]  So, according to Google,
[02:54:54.884 --> 02:55:01.587]  All the search predictions are built off of user search data, so I want to quote them from their own blog.
[02:55:01.587 --> 02:55:03.707]  And they say, predictions, not suggestions.
[02:55:03.707 --> 02:55:08.489]  You'll notice we call these autocomplete predictions rather than suggestions, and there's a good reason for that.
[02:55:08.489 --> 02:55:18.613]  Autocomplete is designed to help people complete a search they were intending to do, not to suggest new types of searches to be performed.
[02:55:18.613 --> 02:55:22.475]  These are our best predictions of the query you are likely to continue entering.
[02:55:23.055 --> 02:55:24.996]  How do we determine these predictions?
[02:55:24.996 --> 02:55:36.101]  We look at the real searches that happen on Google and show common and trending ones relevant to the characters that are entered and also related to your location and previous searches.
[02:55:36.101 --> 02:55:37.041]  Okay?
[02:55:37.041 --> 02:55:43.704]  So, you know, according to these public statements, if there isn't a search prediction, then it's because there's no one searching for them.
[02:55:44.204 --> 02:55:53.410]  Okay, and this would be fine and dandy if it weren't for the fact that we can go to trends.google.com and see the real search traffic, okay?
[02:55:53.410 --> 02:56:04.317]  So, in my Medium article, I took a screenshot where I compared the search traffic for the Clinton body count with the Trump body count.
[02:56:04.317 --> 02:56:06.338]  Now, the Clinton body count is in blue.
[02:56:07.688 --> 02:56:13.758]  You know, and if you look at Trump's, you know, search query results... It's almost at zero down there as read.
[02:56:13.758 --> 02:56:20.850]  It's almost zero, like no one's searching it in relation to the... So that's Death Valley, Trump's Death Valley below sea level, but we're at the top of...
[02:56:22.677 --> 02:56:24.878]  The highest mountain in the world, the Clinton body count.
[02:56:24.878 --> 02:56:25.378]  Right.
[02:56:25.378 --> 02:56:30.579]  And the thing is, is that the historical results from the trend services are much harder to erase and hide.
[02:56:30.579 --> 02:56:34.101]  And this means that we can cross-reference search terms between auto-completion.
[02:56:34.101 --> 02:56:38.662]  So you're bringing out smoking gun evidence, they read this, off their own data.
[02:56:38.962 --> 02:56:39.643]  Yeah.
[02:56:39.643 --> 02:56:47.849]  And what I'm going to ask is for the listeners of the show, I want you to go and use Google Trends and compare it with the Google searches.
[02:56:47.849 --> 02:56:56.455]  And when you see the political bias, I want you to post this to Twitter and maybe a comment section on InfoWars if it exists.
[02:56:56.455 --> 02:57:02.159]  And we need to spread this information around because each one of us can prove that Google is lying.
[02:57:02.159 --> 02:57:02.279]  Yeah.
[02:57:02.279 --> 02:57:02.359]  Yeah.
[02:57:19.471 --> 02:57:22.835]  Hey, this great guy, Zach Voorhees, just showed up today.
[02:57:22.835 --> 02:57:26.318]  He's like doing all these presentations, so it's powerful.
[02:57:26.318 --> 02:57:27.920]  He'll be back tomorrow, too.
[02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:28.921]  He'll be more prepared.
[02:57:28.921 --> 02:57:30.242]  You gotta come in here an hour before the show.
[02:57:30.242 --> 02:57:31.043]  It's all exactly what you want.
[02:57:31.043 --> 02:57:31.944]  It's a cruise great.
[02:57:31.944 --> 02:57:33.366]  You get everything you want, they'll have it.
[02:57:33.366 --> 02:57:33.566]  Yep.
[02:57:33.566 --> 02:57:35.087]  It's like medium, locked us out.
[02:57:35.087 --> 02:57:36.649]  That's why we weren't able to show up in the medium version.
[02:57:36.649 --> 02:57:37.310]  Oh, that's too bad.
[02:57:37.310 --> 02:57:39.312]  It's okay, but we got it on InfoWars.com.
[02:57:39.312 --> 02:57:40.193]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:40.193 --> 02:57:41.975]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:57:44.756 --> 02:57:52.162]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[02:57:52.162 --> 02:57:56.425]  This is a digital, AI-enforced, gag order.
[02:57:56.425 --> 02:58:00.148]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or Infowars.com.
[02:58:05.816 --> 02:58:07.516]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[02:58:07.516 --> 02:58:08.737]  This is racketeering.
[02:58:08.737 --> 02:58:09.857]  This is cartels.
[02:58:09.857 --> 02:58:12.278]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[02:58:12.278 --> 02:58:14.138]  We need it now.
[02:58:14.138 --> 02:58:15.839]  You can take on Big Tech.
[02:58:15.839 --> 02:58:24.781]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[02:58:24.781 --> 02:58:32.824]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[02:58:32.824 --> 02:58:33.684]  The way to fight back
[02:58:34.304 --> 02:58:39.169]  ...is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[02:58:39.169 --> 02:58:42.934]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[02:58:45.766 --> 02:58:55.115]  An InfoWarrior fan favorite formula, Survival Shield X2, continues to lead the way into the next generation of super high quality nascent iodine formulas.
[02:58:55.115 --> 02:59:07.046]  Derived from ancient sea salts found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface, every drop of Survival Shield X2 contains 650 micrograms to keep you in your prime form.
[02:59:07.046 --> 02:59:10.449]  Even today, iodine deficiency remains a serious problem.
[02:59:10.729 --> 02:59:19.672]  With the World Health Organization estimating that nearly 50 million people still suffer from some kind of mental impairment related to iodine deficiency.
[02:59:19.672 --> 02:59:23.313]  That's why it's so important that you try Survival Shield X2.
[02:59:23.313 --> 02:59:34.097]  The only source of 99.999% ultra-pure deep-earth iodine crystals exclusively available through InfoWars Life at an extremely affordable price.

[03:00:03.473 --> 03:00:05.153]  The phones are loaded.
[03:00:05.153 --> 03:00:12.035]  We're live in Defiance of the Tech Giants.
[03:00:12.035 --> 03:00:13.795]  Zach Voorhees is our guest.
[03:00:13.795 --> 03:00:17.036]  And all of a sudden, Zach looks over and he goes, are those all the guests?
[03:00:17.036 --> 03:00:18.136]  Yeah, those are all the callers.
[03:00:18.136 --> 03:00:25.658]  George, and Chase, and Linda, and Ryan, and Matt, and John, and Christy, and Dave, and Vernon, and Jeff, and Sarah.
[03:00:25.658 --> 03:00:28.139]  One time, we looked at how many calls came in during a show.
[03:00:29.379 --> 03:00:29.679]  27,000.
[03:00:29.679 --> 03:00:33.022]  That's how many you're trying to get on the show.
[03:00:33.022 --> 03:00:34.983]  And so we're gonna go to your calls next segment.
[03:00:34.983 --> 03:00:38.225]  We've got so much here, but he said he's one of these engineer tech guys.
[03:00:38.225 --> 03:00:40.786]  He's showing you on radio and TV.
[03:00:40.786 --> 03:00:45.409]  He's going through all the proof and it's amazing and he'll be back tomorrow.
[03:00:45.409 --> 03:00:46.230]  We'll be even more prepared.
[03:00:46.230 --> 03:00:47.251]  I thought he was just coming as a guest.
[03:00:47.251 --> 03:00:49.892]  He has like all this research, kind of like I do.
[03:00:49.892 --> 03:00:54.075]  So you were showing people just now, we have four minutes left of this segment, how their own
[03:00:55.856 --> 03:00:58.679]  Traffic dashboard shows their line.
[03:00:58.679 --> 03:01:03.043]  They're saying, there's no traffic on Clinton body count, that's why it doesn't show up, period.
[03:01:03.043 --> 03:01:04.945]  No, it's just the number one search, continue.
[03:01:04.945 --> 03:01:06.807]  Right, so if we go back to the Google Trends.
[03:01:06.807 --> 03:01:08.929]  Twitter's showing like number one, it still won't show up.
[03:01:08.929 --> 03:01:15.475]  Right, they're suppressing trends on different platforms, you know, and different companies, and they're doing it the same way, and they have the same biases.
[03:01:15.475 --> 03:01:17.497]  They're suppressing the human will for freedom.
[03:01:17.697 --> 03:01:21.040]  Yeah, but they can't fight it because they're fighting against a force of nature.
[03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:21.800]  Exactly.
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:33.730]  Um, so, um, yeah, so, you know, the, the, the crew here is doing a, a search for Clinton body and type in, oh yeah, there you go.
[03:01:33.730 --> 03:01:36.172]  Um, Clinton body count.
[03:01:36.172 --> 03:01:42.057]  Yeah, just, just, uh, and when they hit return, so just go ahead and do the whole phrase, Clinton body count.
[03:01:43.379 --> 03:01:47.162]  Not Clinton body see you're going to need to do the whole thing.
[03:01:47.162 --> 03:01:47.963]  Try stuff live.
[03:01:47.963 --> 03:01:48.664]  It's a train wreck.
[03:01:48.664 --> 03:01:49.485]  Yeah.
[03:01:49.485 --> 03:01:53.949]  Anyways, so you're going to type in Clinton body counts.
[03:01:53.949 --> 03:01:54.169]  Okay.
[03:01:56.351 --> 03:02:01.934]  And then when you hit enter, trends.google.com is going to show that traffic.
[03:02:01.934 --> 03:02:04.795]  And that traffic is relative to historical trends.
[03:02:04.795 --> 03:02:11.799]  Now, what you're going to need to do is you're going to need to compare it against another phrase to show the relative traffic.
[03:02:11.799 --> 03:02:14.040]  So if you go to... Trump body count!
[03:02:14.040 --> 03:02:14.860]  Yeah, so Trump.
[03:02:14.860 --> 03:02:20.423]  So if you click the compare, and then you type in the search term Trump body count,
[03:02:24.485 --> 03:02:29.447]  Then what you're going to get is you're going to get both graphs on the same graph, okay?
[03:02:29.447 --> 03:02:37.190]  And so you could just show us, we know you're telling the truth, but now you've just shown us in live TV and radio with it on screen and boom, just what you said.
[03:02:37.190 --> 03:02:37.511]  Right.
[03:02:37.511 --> 03:02:42.313]  And I want you to do one last thing, which is, uh, it's showing data for the past 12 months.
[03:02:42.313 --> 03:02:45.394]  You're going to want to do that for like the past five years.
[03:02:47.173 --> 03:02:47.933]  Okay.
[03:02:47.933 --> 03:02:52.535]  And so that's going to give you more history on the relative thing of the search.
[03:02:52.535 --> 03:02:53.135]  And there we go.
[03:02:53.135 --> 03:02:54.075]  That's the same graph.
[03:02:54.075 --> 03:02:54.296]  Okay.
[03:02:54.296 --> 03:02:57.177]  So Clinton body count was big back during the last campaign cycle.
[03:02:57.177 --> 03:02:57.457]  Yeah.
[03:02:57.457 --> 03:03:01.458]  And you can see that in there's a spike in October, November of last year.
[03:03:01.458 --> 03:03:02.178]  Right.
[03:03:02.178 --> 03:03:02.578]  And so, um,
[03:03:04.199 --> 03:03:13.246]  So, what's really interesting is that there's obviously a blacklist that's being utilized, either explicitly or embedded in a neural network.
[03:03:13.246 --> 03:03:26.756]  And what's really interesting is that the Google executives, specifically Karan Bhatia, my apologies if I pronounce your last name wrong, he went up before, under oath, to Congress and he said the following.
[03:03:28.203 --> 03:03:35.666]  We do not utilize blacklists or whitelists in our search results to favor political outcomes.
[03:03:35.666 --> 03:03:43.229]  We just heard the head of YouTube, a subcompany, admitting in front of all their people they're doing it, and you just showed their documents, and you just showed their own feeds.
[03:03:43.229 --> 03:03:43.929]  Right.
[03:03:43.929 --> 03:03:51.712]  So he says, you know, we do not utilize blacklists or whitelists in our search results to favor political outcomes.
[03:03:51.712 --> 03:03:53.613]  That's not, doesn't happen.
[03:03:55.168 --> 03:03:56.609]  He says it doesn't happen.
[03:03:56.609 --> 03:03:58.931]  So you just saw total proof that they're lying.
[03:03:58.931 --> 03:03:59.292]  Right.
[03:03:59.292 --> 03:04:01.974]  So is Google lying, or is Google lying, or is Google lying?
[03:04:01.974 --> 03:04:03.295]  You know, we've got three points of reference.
[03:04:03.295 --> 03:04:05.417]  They're lying somewhere, you know, in two out of three.
[03:04:05.417 --> 03:04:06.738]  Like, which one is it?
[03:04:06.738 --> 03:04:07.339]  Okay?
[03:04:07.339 --> 03:04:11.442]  And so, um... And the truth is, they can't manipulate raw data in real time.
[03:04:11.442 --> 03:04:13.564]  That's too hard, because they still want the raw data.
[03:04:13.564 --> 03:04:16.747]  They just manipulate the overall result the public gets.
[03:04:16.747 --> 03:04:19.529]  They don't think people are engineers that go look at their raw data feed.
[03:04:19.529 --> 03:04:22.812]  So clearly, they're putting a blacklist in, which their document shows.
[03:04:23.112 --> 03:04:28.373]  Right, and it's funny because, like, I see this all the time, but nobody knows about this service, Trends.Google.com.
[03:04:28.373 --> 03:04:31.713]  So, you know... But now they do, so let's talk about this, then go to calls.
[03:04:31.713 --> 03:04:36.894]  You said the leftists, the authoritarians, the fascists, are pulling their hair out right now.
[03:04:36.894 --> 03:04:37.174]  Right.
[03:04:37.174 --> 03:04:38.455]  They hate the fact you're doing this.
[03:04:38.455 --> 03:04:44.296]  They hate InfoWars more than anything, and I can imagine that their heads are exploding.
[03:04:44.296 --> 03:04:49.276]  They think that I'm a larp, or that I've invented all of this out of my mind, or whatever.
[03:04:49.276 --> 03:04:52.037]  You know, they have to maintain cognitive dissonance, and whenever you...
[03:04:52.737 --> 03:04:56.901]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[03:04:56.901 --> 03:04:57.963]  They are technocrats.
[03:04:57.963 --> 03:05:00.265]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[03:05:00.265 --> 03:05:07.633]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[03:05:07.633 --> 03:05:09.495]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[03:05:09.495 --> 03:05:11.977]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[03:05:11.977 --> 03:05:14.060]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect
[03:05:14.580 --> 03:05:18.442]  To forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[03:05:18.442 --> 03:05:23.625]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[03:05:23.625 --> 03:05:32.650]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[03:05:33.610 --> 03:05:39.616]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[03:05:39.616 --> 03:05:40.557]  It is amazing.

[03:06:13.755 --> 03:06:14.556]  Breaking news!
[03:06:14.556 --> 03:06:14.696]  Wow!
[03:06:14.696 --> 03:06:17.497]  We're going to get to the breaking news, my compadre, in a moment.
[03:06:17.497 --> 03:06:20.799]  But first, everybody wants to know about the inner workings at Google.
[03:06:20.799 --> 03:06:22.700]  Are they microdosing weekly?
[03:06:22.700 --> 03:06:23.121]  Daily?
[03:06:23.121 --> 03:06:24.462]  With hallucinogens?
[03:06:24.462 --> 03:06:25.722]  DMT?
[03:06:25.722 --> 03:06:29.184]  This video went viral a few weeks ago only because DrugsReport.com linked to it.
[03:06:29.184 --> 03:06:31.406]  What's wrong with big tech's eyes?
[03:06:35.558 --> 03:06:48.204]  You know, the top Nazi, Werner Von Braun, wrote a 1959 book, or 1949 book, I'm going from memory here, called Project Mars, where the Elons are the aliens who end up taking over the Earth.
[03:06:48.204 --> 03:06:51.886]  Beware the Elon and the Elon invasion.
[03:06:51.886 --> 03:06:53.406]  Dr. Werner Von Braun.
[03:06:53.406 --> 03:06:54.227]  Wonder what he knew.
[03:06:54.227 --> 03:07:01.010]  When I watched his promo about this with executives from his company, they all look like they're on hardcore drugs.
[03:07:01.010 --> 03:07:03.851]  I mean, they're like sweating, their eyes are like lit up, like,
[03:07:05.515 --> 03:07:07.197]  I mean, they look nuts.
[03:07:07.197 --> 03:07:08.519]  You know when somebody's on drugs.
[03:07:08.519 --> 03:07:12.204]  You know, they admit Silicon Valley is into hardcore speed and hallucinogens.
[03:07:12.204 --> 03:07:15.809]  They're taking IV drips at work of DMT.
[03:07:15.809 --> 03:07:21.196]  They're taking LSD microdoses and psilocybin mushrooms and peyote every day.
[03:07:21.196 --> 03:07:22.457]  Who in the hell
[03:07:23.058 --> 03:07:24.398]  Would want to join with these people.
[03:07:24.398 --> 03:07:26.919]  I've seen people take like three hits of acid, their eyes aren't that big.
[03:07:26.919 --> 03:07:27.939]  What the hell are they on?
[03:07:27.939 --> 03:07:42.644]  And one of the crew members said maybe they've already got this whole Neuralink virus hooks in their brain because as PKD pointed out, Philip K. Dick back in the 70s, the cyberpunk future is where you can get any type of pleasure you want, just plug in, but no one wants to even get up or eat for weeks or days.
[03:07:42.644 --> 03:07:46.065]  You just die because you just plug all this in and it's the matrix.
[03:07:46.345 --> 03:07:53.527]  And now the Matrix is here, and you look at Tim Cook or Elon Musk or any of his executives when they're up there on that stage, they'll be under white lights.
[03:07:53.527 --> 03:07:56.188]  Their pupils are 90% open.
[03:07:56.188 --> 03:07:59.149]  Zuckerberg, all of them, these people either have brain chips.
[03:07:59.149 --> 03:07:59.989]  That's it.
[03:07:59.989 --> 03:08:02.269]  These guys are wireheads.
[03:08:02.269 --> 03:08:04.070]  Something's going on.
[03:08:04.070 --> 03:08:08.311]  I'm in here underneath bright lights, and my pupils are very little.
[03:08:08.311 --> 03:08:09.211]  Now zoom in again.
[03:08:09.211 --> 03:08:11.112]  My pupils are tiny, because I'm not on drugs.
[03:08:11.852 --> 03:08:13.093]  I've had two cups of coffee today.
[03:08:13.093 --> 03:08:15.156]  Here, let me show you my pupils, okay?
[03:08:15.156 --> 03:08:16.437]  My pupils are little.
[03:08:16.437 --> 03:08:17.718]  They're supposed to close!
[03:08:17.718 --> 03:08:20.721]  That's what happens under the sun or under bright lights, but not these guys.
[03:08:20.721 --> 03:08:21.822]  These are drug addicts.
[03:08:21.822 --> 03:08:24.145]  And they want the hit of wires in their brains.
[03:08:24.145 --> 03:08:27.428]  And all of them have got those giant pupils.
[03:08:27.428 --> 03:08:28.830]  Because they've been there.
[03:08:28.830 --> 03:08:29.631]  And they ain't coming back.
[03:08:32.239 --> 03:08:33.340]  I want them shut down.
[03:08:33.340 --> 03:08:34.301]  I want them silenced.
[03:08:34.301 --> 03:08:35.121]  I want them muted.
[03:08:35.121 --> 03:08:37.383]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:08:37.383 --> 03:08:39.345]  Why are they doing this now?
[03:08:39.345 --> 03:08:44.609]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[03:08:44.609 --> 03:08:53.235]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:53.235 --> 03:08:58.219]  Now that they kicked him off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[03:08:58.499 --> 03:09:02.422]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[03:09:02.422 --> 03:09:11.247]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say, you know, all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[03:09:11.247 --> 03:09:12.808]  I have no issue with it at all.
[03:09:12.808 --> 03:09:13.889]  I want them shut down.
[03:09:13.889 --> 03:09:14.850]  I want them silenced.
[03:09:14.850 --> 03:09:15.690]  I want them muted.
[03:09:15.690 --> 03:09:18.832]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:09:18.832 --> 03:09:20.233]  I want them shut down!
[03:09:20.233 --> 03:09:21.794]  I want them silenced!
[03:09:21.794 --> 03:09:23.035]  I want them muted!
[03:09:23.035 --> 03:09:24.296]  But don't worry.
[03:09:24.296 --> 03:09:25.997]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[03:09:28.946 --> 03:09:35.270]  Well, Google and the big tech folks are playing a very, very dangerous game.
[03:09:35.270 --> 03:09:41.893]  They think that they're going to be able to abuse all this power and get away with it and then suppress everybody.
[03:09:41.893 --> 03:09:44.415]  That doesn't go well in history.
[03:09:44.415 --> 03:09:46.196]  And I just can't believe they're pushing this hard.
[03:09:46.196 --> 03:09:47.757]  We're going to go to your phone calls here in a moment.
[03:09:48.852 --> 03:09:53.434]  And you just saw that video that we aired, What's Wrong With Big Tech's Eyes.
[03:09:53.434 --> 03:09:56.416]  We've got some big breaking news here, just briefly.
[03:09:56.416 --> 03:10:04.140]  If you don't remember, and I'm not bitching and blaming, but we just keep delivering freedom, we keep delivering bombshells, whistleblowers, we're in the zeitgeist.
[03:10:04.140 --> 03:10:16.766]  And I am nothing but thankful to all the viewers, all the listeners, my family, this crew, and Matt Drudge, who's the only person out there that isn't a coward in independent media that supports us, because he supports himself and freedom and sanity.
[03:10:17.606 --> 03:10:17.866]  I think?
[03:10:48.086 --> 03:10:49.787]  And we need your support.
[03:10:49.787 --> 03:10:52.229]  The big super special is about to end.
[03:10:52.229 --> 03:10:54.930]  50-60% off on many items in the store.
[03:10:54.930 --> 03:10:57.052]  We had to get rid of some because they were selling out.
[03:10:57.052 --> 03:11:06.277]  Almost all the water filtration sold out because all the stuff's coming out about fluoride in the water and brain damage and all these Democratic candidates are admitting the water's poison.
[03:11:06.277 --> 03:11:07.398]  It's like, you weren't listening to me?
[03:11:07.398 --> 03:11:09.539]  I mean, we've got like five companies.
[03:11:09.539 --> 03:11:11.360]  We sell whatever the highest rate it is.
[03:11:11.360 --> 03:11:14.742]  We sold out of three of the five companies right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:11:15.828 --> 03:11:20.830]  The other reason is people search it and they go, wait a minute, he really is selling Alexa Pure and Pro Pure at the lowest price.
[03:11:20.830 --> 03:11:21.730]  Yeah.
[03:11:21.730 --> 03:11:33.994]  In fact, that's the trap I put myself in, is that we bring in tons of money, but because we sell stuff cheaper than Amazon, it's kind of like, no wonder we're successful, but we're not successful at getting the cash we need.
[03:11:33.994 --> 03:11:37.035]  Big numbers of money, but small slice to fund it.
[03:11:37.035 --> 03:11:40.456]  So, please, infowarestore.com, they're products you already need.
[03:11:40.456 --> 03:11:41.677]  I want to thank you all.
[03:11:41.677 --> 03:11:44.338]  So you got, they brought this in during the break, and you got,
[03:11:45.198 --> 03:11:48.941]  Excited, sort of waving your arms around, and you wanted to read the article.
[03:11:48.941 --> 03:11:51.463]  Breaking news!
[03:11:51.463 --> 03:11:51.903]  Yeah, tell us.
[03:11:51.903 --> 03:11:54.605]  Yeah, okay, so this is just in.
[03:11:54.605 --> 03:11:59.249]  Google DeepMind co-founder placed on leave from AI Lab.
[03:11:59.249 --> 03:12:02.031]  Alright, so can I read this on air?
[03:12:02.031 --> 03:12:14.140]  Okay, so the co-founder of DeepMind, the high-profile artificial intelligence lab owned by Google, has been placed on leave after controversy over some of the projects he led.
[03:12:15.282 --> 03:12:23.952]  So, he runs the DeepMinds Applied Division which seeks practical uses for the lab's research in health, energy, and other fields.
[03:12:27.284 --> 03:12:28.225]  What is DeepMind?
[03:12:28.225 --> 03:12:36.091]  DeepMind is Google's AI Manhattan Project, and it's being run out of China right now.
[03:12:36.091 --> 03:12:55.006]  And this is really important because Peter Thiel did an article in the New York Times, you know, asking whether Google is committing treason by working with China's military for its AI Manhattan Project, while at the same time
[03:12:56.227 --> 03:12:56.687]  We're good.
[03:13:11.776 --> 03:13:12.637]  There's a shakeup.
[03:13:12.637 --> 03:13:14.259]  I'm not entirely sure what it means.
[03:13:14.259 --> 03:13:18.984]  Google's been pretty good with protecting its own.
[03:13:18.984 --> 03:13:26.771]  When we caught Jen Janai saying that she wanted to rig the 2020 elections to prevent another Trump situation, Google protected her.
[03:13:27.412 --> 03:13:29.073]  And nothing happened.
[03:13:29.073 --> 03:13:34.236]  The fact that people are now trying to exit the company, and this is breaking news, is huge.
[03:13:34.236 --> 03:13:35.376]  It's huge.
[03:13:35.376 --> 03:13:37.557]  There's cracks that are beginning to form.
[03:13:37.557 --> 03:13:39.478]  And again, Google isn't just some search engine.
[03:13:39.478 --> 03:13:40.999]  It's into thousands of companies.
[03:13:40.999 --> 03:13:46.102]  It's buying everything up, stifling free innovation, and trying to push a globalist system.
[03:13:46.102 --> 03:13:48.923]  That's why a lot of folks are like, well I don't use Google, why are you obsessed on it?
[03:13:50.764 --> 03:13:52.425]  Four billion people do.
[03:13:52.425 --> 03:13:53.826]  It's the Panopticon.
[03:13:53.826 --> 03:13:56.068]  Like, it's the all-seeing eye everywhere.
[03:13:56.068 --> 03:14:01.632]  Like, you're emailing, you're Google Chrome.
[03:14:01.632 --> 03:14:05.795]  Every kid's got, like, a Chromebook, it seems now, for education.
[03:14:05.795 --> 03:14:09.557]  Everywhere you go, there's a Google product that you use.
[03:14:09.557 --> 03:14:11.719]  And when I started... Let's just say it.
[03:14:11.719 --> 03:14:13.280]  You know, if my wife's not in the mood,
[03:14:13.920 --> 03:14:16.004]  And I grab her ass, she slaps it away.
[03:14:16.004 --> 03:14:19.351]  Well, Google's got their arm, I don't mean to be gross, up our ass.
[03:14:19.351 --> 03:14:21.515]  I mean, a lot of us didn't ask for this.
[03:14:21.515 --> 03:14:23.278]  Yeah, it's not consensual, right?
[03:14:23.278 --> 03:14:24.460]  It's not consensual.
[03:14:26.178 --> 03:14:28.440]  Yeah, so this is big news.
[03:14:28.440 --> 03:14:31.282]  It looks like something big is starting to happen.
[03:14:31.282 --> 03:14:37.567]  The Wall Street Journal yesterday... By the way, Snopes is fact-checking this.
[03:14:37.567 --> 03:14:38.548]  They found it not true.
[03:14:38.548 --> 03:14:41.090]  I was not raped by Mark Zuckerberg.
[03:14:41.090 --> 03:14:41.770]  It's not a joke.
[03:14:41.770 --> 03:14:43.291]  They just said it was fake.
[03:14:43.291 --> 03:14:43.812]  Wow.
[03:14:43.812 --> 03:14:45.453]  We're trying to trick people.
[03:14:45.453 --> 03:14:47.375]  I hope one day you can recover from that.
[03:14:47.375 --> 03:14:48.716]  We'll try to trick them.
[03:14:49.966 --> 03:14:52.187]  I know a doctor if you need one.
[03:14:52.187 --> 03:14:56.770]  Yeah, so this is big.
[03:14:56.770 --> 03:14:59.571]  This is big, the fact that there's someone leaving.
[03:14:59.571 --> 03:15:12.458]  And the Wall Street Journal just posted yesterday that the states are coming together in order to file an antitrust lawsuit against Google for their improper censorship.
[03:15:12.458 --> 03:15:17.021]  But what the government's got to get is, we're now 15 months out from the election.
[03:15:18.760 --> 03:15:20.461]  Or less.
[03:15:20.461 --> 03:15:21.281]  Google gets it.
[03:15:21.281 --> 03:15:21.821]  They're in a fight.
[03:15:21.821 --> 03:15:23.101]  They're not giving up.
[03:15:23.101 --> 03:15:26.282]  They're racing to steal it, admitting they are.
[03:15:26.282 --> 03:15:27.683]  We have all the internal documents.
[03:15:27.683 --> 03:15:28.723]  We infiltrated them.
[03:15:28.723 --> 03:15:29.623]  You came out.
[03:15:29.623 --> 03:15:32.264]  I mean, it's an open and shut case.
[03:15:32.264 --> 03:15:35.305]  So if we just keep like, well, we're going to break you up.
[03:15:35.305 --> 03:15:36.765]  They don't give a flying.
[03:15:36.765 --> 03:15:37.525]  They're moving.
[03:15:37.525 --> 03:15:38.466]  They're not giving up.
[03:15:38.466 --> 03:15:40.486]  So what do you do in a crisis like that?
[03:15:40.486 --> 03:15:42.347]  I think it's a national security issue.
[03:15:42.347 --> 03:15:44.627]  As Peter Thiel has said, they're in bed with China.
[03:15:44.627 --> 03:15:45.608]  So is Apple.
[03:15:45.608 --> 03:15:46.848]  I think you have to arrest the leadership.
[03:15:47.248 --> 03:15:51.553]  Or let them steal the election and they've got the Washington Post saying China will crush Trump in America.
[03:16:07.168 --> 03:16:08.370]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:08.370 --> 03:16:11.295]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:11.295 --> 03:16:13.518]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:13.518 --> 03:16:17.966]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:17.966 --> 03:16:20.329]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:21.875 --> 03:16:23.136]  Maybe not today.
[03:16:23.136 --> 03:16:24.417]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[03:16:24.417 --> 03:16:28.160]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:29.241]  Forget bunkers.
[03:16:29.241 --> 03:16:31.083]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[03:16:31.083 --> 03:16:32.784]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[03:16:32.784 --> 03:16:40.591]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[03:16:40.591 --> 03:16:41.591]  Bold statement?
[03:16:41.591 --> 03:16:42.592]  You bet.

[03:17:52.841 --> 03:17:54.162]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[03:17:54.162 --> 03:17:54.962]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[03:17:54.962 --> 03:17:55.522]  Thanks for holding.
[03:17:55.522 --> 03:17:56.043]  Hey, Alex.
[03:17:56.043 --> 03:17:58.864]  Yeah, I just want to say, uh, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[03:17:58.864 --> 03:18:04.988]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:18:04.988 --> 03:18:13.793]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[03:18:13.793 --> 03:18:14.953]  That's it.
[03:18:14.953 --> 03:18:17.595]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:18:17.595 --> 03:18:20.456]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:18:20.456 --> 03:18:21.737]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:18:21.897 --> 03:18:22.657]  I agree entirely.
[03:18:22.657 --> 03:18:28.100]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:18:28.100 --> 03:18:30.882]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:18:30.882 --> 03:18:32.963]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:18:32.963 --> 03:18:42.187]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:18:42.187 --> 03:18:44.108]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[03:18:44.108 --> 03:18:50.591]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:18:50.591 --> 03:18:51.532]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:18:52.762 --> 03:19:05.955]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[03:19:05.955 --> 03:19:08.858]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[03:19:08.858 --> 03:19:10.620]  farming goods a week ago.
[03:19:10.620 --> 03:19:14.283]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[03:19:14.904 --> 03:19:19.468]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[03:19:19.468 --> 03:19:20.509]  That's beautiful.
[03:19:20.509 --> 03:19:22.411]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[03:19:22.411 --> 03:19:24.013]  And we aren't going to back down.
[03:19:24.013 --> 03:19:31.600]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[03:19:31.600 --> 03:19:33.942]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[03:19:33.942 --> 03:19:38.106]  And the human spirit lives at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:19:38.106 --> 03:19:39.026]  And I'm asking listeners,
[03:19:39.807 --> 03:19:43.932]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[03:19:43.932 --> 03:19:45.034]  We are the resistance.
[03:19:45.034 --> 03:19:55.266]  We are 1776 Worldwide!
[03:19:55.266 --> 03:19:57.929]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:14.179 --> 03:20:16.081]  Alright, I said I'd take an hour of your calls.
[03:20:16.081 --> 03:20:22.106]  We're already 20 minutes into this hour, but I'm gonna go to George, Chase, Linda, Ryan, John, Jeff, Vernon right now.
[03:20:22.106 --> 03:20:23.047]  Sarah, we're gonna go to you, but...
[03:20:24.386 --> 03:20:26.208]  What's wrong with Big Tech's eyes?
[03:20:26.208 --> 03:20:30.272]  I mean, you look at the heads of Big Tech and people, they're under bright lights.
[03:20:30.272 --> 03:20:31.313]  And I'm under bright lights.
[03:20:31.313 --> 03:20:32.835]  My eyes, my pupils are tiny.
[03:20:32.835 --> 03:20:36.238]  Theirs are huge, like they're on a big dose of some kind of drug.
[03:20:36.238 --> 03:20:37.259]  I mean, that's what we know from.
[03:20:37.259 --> 03:20:44.607]  But you were explaining, especially when you look at Tim Cook of Apple's eyes, that it's something else going on.
[03:20:44.607 --> 03:20:45.328]  What's your experience?
[03:20:45.988 --> 03:20:56.821]  Uh, there was something that I read somewhere in psychology where, um, one of the ways you can sort of lock someone into a trance is by, like, opening your eyes like this and continuing to talk.
[03:20:56.821 --> 03:21:04.990]  So, you'll see a lot of politicians, a lot of people, like, open their eyes and just continue to talk, and it's a good technique in order to deceive, like, people.
[03:21:04.990 --> 03:21:06.331]  I'm kind of doing it, like, right now.
[03:21:06.932 --> 03:21:08.415]  Look at camera 4, it's over there.
[03:21:08.415 --> 03:21:09.457]  Camera 4, okay.
[03:21:09.457 --> 03:21:17.190]  So, you know, if I'm wanting to tell you a lie, then I'm going to open up my eyes real wide and I'm just going to talk to you and you're going to get locked into a trance.
[03:21:17.190 --> 03:21:19.334]  And one of the key things is that you don't want to blink.
[03:21:20.615 --> 03:21:21.415]  This is a little trick.
[03:21:21.415 --> 03:21:27.797]  So is that why the Infobabes, like on Fox and stuff, don't blink, they're like, they're licking their lips, doing the sexual thing.
[03:21:27.797 --> 03:21:33.819]  They're doing that, like, literally trick our biology for a man to think, Megyn Kelly wants me, but she doesn't.
[03:21:33.819 --> 03:21:35.059]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:21:35.059 --> 03:21:38.840]  And it's also the reasons why they have, like, the spinning sigils, like that.
[03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:42.541]  Basically, they're trying to induce, like, a trance state to, like, prepare the person.
[03:21:42.541 --> 03:21:48.063]  And you can actually see it, like, on the EEGs, you can see that people kind of, like, break into, like, I think it's like alpha waves or something.
[03:21:48.063 --> 03:21:49.263]  They're trying to put you into a trance state.
[03:21:49.403 --> 03:21:57.888]  Yeah, because the thing is, is that as they get you into that trance state, they can give you, you become more suggestible.
[03:21:57.888 --> 03:21:59.909]  Can we go back to the two minute video?
[03:21:59.909 --> 03:22:00.790]  What's wrong with Big Tech Size?
[03:22:00.790 --> 03:22:03.871]  I want to show Tim Cook's eyes, because I get what you're saying.
[03:22:03.871 --> 03:22:04.832]  There it is.
[03:22:04.832 --> 03:22:06.653]  I mean, he's under bright lights, man.
[03:22:06.653 --> 03:22:10.295]  You've got to be on some drugs to get your, or is he on a brain chip?
[03:22:10.295 --> 03:22:11.076]  I mean, how do you do that?
[03:22:12.048 --> 03:22:12.268]  Right?
[03:22:12.268 --> 03:22:17.472]  I mean, but the thing that you can notice is that his pupils are dilated.
[03:22:17.472 --> 03:22:28.379]  And the question that I have, just looking at this picture, not knowing it before, is, you know, whether the light, may it be really dim, but oh my god, it looks like he's on some sort of drug, right?
[03:22:28.379 --> 03:22:30.981]  His pupils are just super dilated.
[03:22:30.981 --> 03:22:33.183]  And so, um, wow.
[03:22:33.183 --> 03:22:33.363]  Yeah.
[03:22:34.304 --> 03:22:37.787]  I know that in Silicon Valley there's a lot of microdosing that goes on.
[03:22:37.787 --> 03:22:40.490]  It's kind of like a mind hack.
[03:22:40.490 --> 03:22:45.575]  So I know you were talking about that earlier, but it should be a good question.
[03:22:45.575 --> 03:22:47.817]  Why are his pupils so dilated?
[03:22:49.292 --> 03:22:51.234]  Alright, we're going to go to phone calls now.
[03:22:51.234 --> 03:22:55.258]  First time a big Google engineer has gone public and taken phone calls.
[03:22:55.258 --> 03:22:58.481]  George Chase, Linda, everybody, who's been holding the longest here?
[03:22:58.481 --> 03:23:02.084]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[03:23:02.084 --> 03:23:07.249]  Let's go ahead and talk to Vernon in Florida.
[03:23:07.249 --> 03:23:10.252]  You're on the air with Jack Voorhees.
[03:23:10.252 --> 03:23:10.513]  Go ahead.
[03:23:12.543 --> 03:23:13.904]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:23:13.904 --> 03:23:15.305]  I really appreciate what you guys do.
[03:23:15.305 --> 03:23:17.387]  Appreciate you holding.
[03:23:17.387 --> 03:23:35.403]  Just to comment on some of the censorship that I've seen from Google is I own a small auto repair business here in Florida and if somebody Googles auto repair business near me, literally sitting in my parking lot, it will give them search results for whoever pays the most.
[03:23:35.403 --> 03:23:38.605]  So I get telemarketing calls all the time saying that if I
[03:23:39.861 --> 03:23:46.064]  Verify my listing and I spend enough money with them, they'll bump my ad to the front of the list.
[03:23:46.064 --> 03:23:53.827]  And so just, you know, I was making a comment as far as censorship that I've seen myself just as a small business owner.
[03:23:53.827 --> 03:23:54.227]  Exactly.
[03:23:54.227 --> 03:23:59.250]  You're going down the road, you need gas or you need a carburetor and they don't tell you the place that's right there.
[03:23:59.250 --> 03:24:01.350]  They tell you one five miles away because they pay.
[03:24:01.350 --> 03:24:03.932]  Yeah, so I actually have the solution to this thing.
[03:24:03.932 --> 03:24:06.873]  Are you on maps.google.com as a listed business?
[03:24:07.711 --> 03:24:08.271]  Yes, I am.
[03:24:08.271 --> 03:24:10.353]  I verified it, you know, personally.
[03:24:10.353 --> 03:24:10.833]  Okay.
[03:24:10.833 --> 03:24:16.497]  And so you've got a places.google.com sort of listing for your thing?
[03:24:16.497 --> 03:24:16.737]  Right.
[03:24:16.737 --> 03:24:28.685]  And my understanding when I talked to one of the telemarketers is what they do is they actually sit there and search and search and search your business name if you pay them enough so that that way it gets moved to the top of the list.
[03:24:29.765 --> 03:24:34.329]  Regardless of location, it'll still come up with whoever has paid them the most.
[03:24:34.329 --> 03:24:38.772]  It doesn't really even matter as far as like, uh... Sure, that's fraud.
[03:24:38.772 --> 03:24:48.019]  I mean, one thing if it said, add for mufflers, or add for transmission, or auto repair, and then showed you the closest result, but...
[03:24:48.863 --> 03:24:51.864]  Now they only do it off the page.
[03:24:51.864 --> 03:24:52.284]  Right.
[03:24:52.284 --> 03:24:55.565]  You know, so they're doing it off of user search traffic.
[03:24:55.565 --> 03:24:59.426]  And so a lot of these people are SEO wizards.
[03:24:59.426 --> 03:25:01.546]  SEO meaning search engine optimization.
[03:25:01.546 --> 03:25:10.668]  And then what they do is that they fake user traffic in order to artificially inflate the perceived value of that link and it ranks it up.
[03:25:10.668 --> 03:25:16.970]  So if you want to, you know, get into this, the concept of Google hacking is called SEO.
[03:25:16.970 --> 03:25:18.210]  Okay.
[03:25:19.533 --> 03:25:24.256]  And so what you've got to do is go hire a company to run a bunch of fake traffic to your business.
[03:25:24.256 --> 03:25:26.637]  Correct, yeah, and that's what these companies call.
[03:25:26.637 --> 03:25:29.419]  I mean, up to three times a day I get a phone call from these companies.
[03:25:29.419 --> 03:25:40.665]  And listen, I think that's terrible and bad, but Google actively suppressing the RNC being able to run an ad or something, or Twitter suppressing the RNC running an ad, or Facebook.
[03:25:40.665 --> 03:25:44.127]  I'm not saying your problem's not a problem, I get it.
[03:25:44.127 --> 03:25:46.249]  That's something that is being manipulated by locals.
[03:25:46.809 --> 03:25:49.910]  Through the system, because Google's designed to be hacked, as you were saying.
[03:25:49.910 --> 03:25:55.712]  But the big enchilada is that it's being done to our entire election system.
[03:25:55.712 --> 03:25:56.172]  Oh, yes.
[03:25:56.172 --> 03:26:00.794]  It's way, way worse politically as far as, you know, manipulating elections and stuff.
[03:26:00.794 --> 03:26:04.395]  It's just, it can go all the way down to the local level.
[03:26:04.395 --> 03:26:06.596]  Oh, you're just giving us a local example, which is very important.
[03:26:06.596 --> 03:26:07.777]  Thank you, Vernon.
[03:26:07.777 --> 03:26:09.878]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[03:26:09.878 --> 03:26:12.819]  Let's talk to Linda in New York.
[03:26:12.819 --> 03:26:13.319]  You're on the air.
[03:26:13.319 --> 03:26:13.579]  Go ahead.
[03:26:14.414 --> 03:26:18.215]  Hi Alex, thanks for all the good you do for the American people.
[03:26:18.215 --> 03:26:19.875]  I'm trying.
[03:26:19.875 --> 03:26:28.898]  My question is, would it be of value for Zach to trade info with NSA database developer Bill Binney on data mining?
[03:26:28.898 --> 03:26:34.399]  You kind of missed that, trade info with a data miner?
[03:26:34.399 --> 03:26:36.020]  With William Binney.
[03:26:36.795 --> 03:26:40.639]  Right, so... Oh, would you like to come on sometime with the former technical head of the NSA?
[03:26:40.639 --> 03:26:44.063]  I would love to talk to NSA whistleblower Bill Binney.
[03:26:44.063 --> 03:26:56.517]  He's a courageous individual, you know, who's come and revealed to the public, you know, the large surveillance apparatus that was pointed directly at them and vacuuming up all their data.
[03:26:57.359 --> 03:27:06.527]  Um, you know, the big data thing is actually outside of my specialty, but I'm sure that we can, you know, trade notes.
[03:27:06.527 --> 03:27:08.969]  But isn't that really what Google is and Facebook?
[03:27:08.969 --> 03:27:11.552]  It's like privatizing that same NSA system.
[03:27:12.654 --> 03:27:19.395]  Well, yeah, I mean, the thing is that we've heard a lot about the NSA data collection, but Google dwarfs that.
[03:27:19.395 --> 03:27:25.376]  And, you know, the media has been pounding this drum, oh, it's really bad that the NSA has all this data.
[03:27:25.376 --> 03:27:27.317]  It's really bad that the NSA has all this data.
[03:27:27.317 --> 03:27:32.518]  But, like, it's completely dwarfed by what Google has on you.
[03:27:32.518 --> 03:27:36.499]  Like, they've got your real-time location data from your phone.
[03:27:36.499 --> 03:27:38.599]  So really, I mean, Google is the real NSA?
[03:27:39.099 --> 03:27:52.830]  Yeah, it's, you know, it's ridiculous to talk about the NSA when, you know, Google and, you know, the old CIA were far more insidious and comprehensive.
[03:27:52.830 --> 03:27:54.751]  Linda, anything else?
[03:27:54.751 --> 03:27:56.532]  No, thank you very much.
[03:27:56.532 --> 03:27:56.833]  Thank you.
[03:27:57.771 --> 03:28:07.496]  All right, we've got to go to break here in about 50 seconds, but I promise every caller we're getting to you with our guest in the War Room in 30 minutes is coming up today, 3 p.m.
[03:28:07.496 --> 03:28:07.916]  Central.
[03:28:07.916 --> 03:28:13.979]  And again, you were talking about human viral movements of information versus digital.
[03:28:13.979 --> 03:28:16.100]  So how would you quantify that with 30 seconds?
[03:28:16.100 --> 03:28:18.161]  How do we get the audience to realize how powerful they are?
[03:28:18.956 --> 03:28:40.372]  Look, like every one of us should share InfoWars and tell our friends about it because the thing is is that you can either go viral through digital means or viral by telling your friends and this is really an important watershed moment so you know show the sensors that we can make this go viral by each one of us making it go viral.
[03:28:40.372 --> 03:28:45.296]  It really is a fight between human intelligence and AI now because the AI has been hijacked.
[03:28:46.037 --> 03:28:47.846]  Alright, Zach Voorhees, our guest.
[03:28:47.846 --> 03:28:48.991]  We're your call, straight ahead.

[03:29:52.961 --> 03:30:04.169]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[03:30:04.169 --> 03:30:08.312]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[03:30:08.312 --> 03:30:17.679]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[03:30:18.399 --> 03:30:20.441]  The system is vulnerable.
[03:30:20.441 --> 03:30:23.124]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[03:30:23.124 --> 03:30:26.747]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[03:30:26.747 --> 03:30:33.654]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[03:30:33.654 --> 03:30:39.000]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.

[03:30:52.779 --> 03:31:05.972]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[03:31:05.972 --> 03:31:08.875]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[03:31:08.875 --> 03:31:10.637]  farming goods a week ago.
[03:31:10.637 --> 03:31:14.280]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[03:31:14.921 --> 03:31:19.482]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[03:31:19.482 --> 03:31:20.522]  That's beautiful.
[03:31:20.522 --> 03:31:22.403]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[03:31:22.403 --> 03:31:24.003]  And we aren't going to back down.
[03:31:24.003 --> 03:31:31.605]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[03:31:31.605 --> 03:31:33.946]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[03:31:33.946 --> 03:31:38.107]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:31:38.107 --> 03:31:39.027]  And I'm asking listeners,

[03:32:56.338 --> 03:32:58.952]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.506 --> 03:33:34.442]  It's absolutely critical to the social engineers, the ultra-rich on this planet, to divide and conquer humanity and to really rob us of our birthright and the real potential we have if the general public makes decisions about our own development, our own evolution.
[03:33:34.442 --> 03:33:37.125]  I don't mean that from a Darwinian perspective or getting some fight about it.
[03:33:37.125 --> 03:33:38.646]  We are evolving.
[03:33:38.646 --> 03:33:39.927]  I'd say devolving right now.
[03:33:41.207 --> 03:33:48.389]  And everything we've been given, everything we've been basically pushed is destroying human communities.
[03:33:48.389 --> 03:33:55.792]  They want Google and Facebook communities where everything's 5G and you're inside these weird bubbles and you're totally programmed.
[03:33:55.792 --> 03:34:00.814]  These are corporations that want markets where they have captive humans that are totally under their control.
[03:34:00.814 --> 03:34:01.514]  It's like a proto
[03:34:03.542 --> 03:34:03.923]  Matrix.
[03:34:18.746 --> 03:34:20.907]  Google is suppressing your interviews.
[03:34:20.907 --> 03:34:21.967]  They are blocking it.
[03:34:21.967 --> 03:34:23.627]  They are tearing their hair out right now.
[03:34:23.627 --> 03:34:31.390]  You were telling me off air that you're on air talking about all this because you've released the smoking gun documents of their blacklist and their perjury to Congress.
[03:34:31.390 --> 03:34:32.430]  This is huge.
[03:34:32.430 --> 03:34:41.552]  Yeah, and big things are happening, you know, breaking news like today that, you know, you know, as a reminder, the Google DeepMind co-founder placed on leave from AI Lab.
[03:34:43.714 --> 03:34:46.197]  And again, that's the big, real AI system.
[03:34:46.197 --> 03:34:49.462]  That's the big, that's the AI Manhattan Project that Google's working on.
[03:34:49.462 --> 03:34:51.045]  Who do you think has the dominant system?
[03:34:51.045 --> 03:34:56.152]  Because we know IBM's involved, we know Microsoft is involved, we know everybody's racing to get the AI.
[03:34:57.205 --> 03:34:59.548]  Yeah, I don't know.
[03:34:59.548 --> 03:35:05.815]  I do know that the big tech giants, they all have their own version and their own flavor of AI.
[03:35:05.815 --> 03:35:07.216]  So there's competing AI.
[03:35:07.216 --> 03:35:09.739]  Yeah, but Google is the one with the most data.
[03:35:09.739 --> 03:35:12.302]  And they went to China where there's no rules.
[03:35:12.302 --> 03:35:14.724]  Right, and the thing is that the person with the
[03:35:15.405 --> 03:35:20.027]  Most data is going to have the best AI because AI is feeding off of data.
[03:35:20.027 --> 03:35:23.549]  And so that's, that's, you know, that's it.
[03:35:23.549 --> 03:35:27.171]  You know, nobody goes to a YouTube version on IBM.
[03:35:27.171 --> 03:35:32.834]  And so, you know, Google's got... Why do you think they told the Pentagon a year ago or two years ago now?
[03:35:33.174 --> 03:35:39.203]  We're not going to work with you in the arrogance that we're going to move to China when we all know Google was a NSA project.
[03:35:39.203 --> 03:35:39.604]  Right.
[03:35:39.604 --> 03:35:42.789]  So, you know, Google was funded by In-Q-Tel when it got its start.
[03:35:42.789 --> 03:35:45.613]  So it was, you know, done with CIA money.
[03:35:45.613 --> 03:35:47.056]  And the thing was, is
[03:35:48.698 --> 03:35:57.807]  Google started a project with the US military called Project Maven, which was going to use information from their geo databases.
[03:35:57.807 --> 03:36:05.494]  And what happened was a bunch of, a small contingent of employees decided that they were going to protest this.
[03:36:05.494 --> 03:36:09.618]  And what was really weird is I got an email, you know, one time, one day at my desk.
[03:36:10.279 --> 03:36:24.696]  From the Google executive team saying, hey, by the way, well, you know that there's going to be a protest today on Project Maven, and if you want to join the protest, then that's your right, and you're not going to suffer any consequences.
[03:36:24.696 --> 03:36:25.617]  They're promoting it.
[03:36:25.617 --> 03:36:26.458]  Yeah, they're promoting it.
[03:36:27.439 --> 03:36:28.059]  Absolutely.
[03:36:28.059 --> 03:36:31.040]  So they promoted this, and then a bunch of employees walked out.
[03:36:31.040 --> 03:36:33.781]  And a lot of people actually didn't end up walking out.
[03:36:33.781 --> 03:36:36.182]  It was a very, very, very tiny minority.
[03:36:36.182 --> 03:36:40.364]  But then the media pumped that up, and then Google threw up their hands.
[03:36:40.364 --> 03:36:44.725]  They said, look, we wanted to do this, but our employees are revolting.
[03:36:44.725 --> 03:36:47.346]  So the truth is, Obama and all of them said, go with China.
[03:36:47.346 --> 03:36:50.427]  And then once Trump got elected, the decision was final.
[03:36:50.427 --> 03:36:54.228]  Just like the Washington Post says, we hope Xi can crush America.
[03:36:54.228 --> 03:36:55.449]  It says, destroy Trump.
[03:36:56.309 --> 03:36:58.249]  Destroy Trump is the headline.
[03:36:58.249 --> 03:37:00.570]  Destroy Trump to save us, of course.
[03:37:00.570 --> 03:37:02.670]  It's so Orwellian.
[03:37:02.670 --> 03:37:03.990]  The corporations have made their deal.
[03:37:03.990 --> 03:37:09.211]  This guy, he's got a billion, 300 million slaves, and it's just crazy how far they've gone.
[03:37:09.211 --> 03:37:10.752]  Let's go back to your calls.
[03:37:10.752 --> 03:37:15.133]  Okay, he's been holding longest here.
[03:37:15.133 --> 03:37:17.273]  Try to move quick here now.
[03:37:17.273 --> 03:37:20.273]  Let's go to Ryan in Florida.
[03:37:20.273 --> 03:37:21.754]  Ryan, then we'll go to Sarah.
[03:37:21.754 --> 03:37:22.394]  Ryan, you're on the air.
[03:37:22.394 --> 03:37:22.954]  Thanks for calling.
[03:37:23.675 --> 03:37:25.636]  Alex Jones, General Honeysmack.
[03:37:25.636 --> 03:37:26.377]  Great to talk to you, man.
[03:37:26.377 --> 03:37:27.557]  It's an honor.
[03:37:27.557 --> 03:37:28.558]  Good to have you.
[03:37:28.558 --> 03:37:30.179]  So what's your question?
[03:37:30.179 --> 03:37:39.504]  I wanted to ask you and Jack both, what do you guys think that President Trump can do about all this big tech censorship that won't be negated by, let's say, a liberal judge?
[03:37:39.504 --> 03:37:43.566]  You know, we've seen every time a liberal judge doesn't like what he does, boom, now Trump's hands are tied.
[03:37:43.566 --> 03:37:46.147]  What can we do personally, or what can Trump do?
[03:37:46.147 --> 03:37:47.488]  Like, we're not able to rely on Trump.
[03:37:47.827 --> 03:37:49.368]  You know, both of those kind of things.
[03:37:49.368 --> 03:37:50.988]  What do you think we can do?
[03:37:50.988 --> 03:37:53.489]  Yeah, so that's a very excellent question.
[03:37:53.489 --> 03:38:00.813]  And so my plan for this is that with this document disclosure is that one, tell your friends.
[03:38:01.829 --> 03:38:03.090]  And download the information.
[03:38:03.090 --> 03:38:04.270]  Have them download it.
[03:38:04.270 --> 03:38:07.372]  Two, educate yourself.
[03:38:07.372 --> 03:38:17.618]  And three, call your radio stations, call your senators, call your representatives, and tell them that they need to stop tech censorship.
[03:38:17.618 --> 03:38:19.479]  Let your human voice be heard.
[03:38:19.479 --> 03:38:19.699]  Right.
[03:38:19.699 --> 03:38:21.540]  Because they're trying to suppress your speech online.
[03:38:21.540 --> 03:38:22.061]  Good.
[03:38:22.061 --> 03:38:23.381]  We'll just do it in the third dimension.
[03:38:23.381 --> 03:38:23.662]  Right.
[03:38:23.662 --> 03:38:27.404]  And the thing is, is that right now all of the Congress people are
[03:38:28.084 --> 03:38:28.264]  I don't
[03:38:46.281 --> 03:38:52.544]  The states are all banding together for antitrust, you know, litigation, which was reported by the Wall Street Journal just yesterday.
[03:38:52.544 --> 03:39:03.669]  So, if you want to be part of this, if you want to do America good and right, then call your senator, call your representative, and tell them to stop big tech censorship.
[03:39:03.669 --> 03:39:06.710]  It's not just censorship on conservatives.
[03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:09.971]  They also censored Tulsi Gabbard, okay?
[03:39:09.971 --> 03:39:10.511]  That's right.
[03:39:10.511 --> 03:39:11.572]  Stop election meddling.
[03:39:11.972 --> 03:39:12.993]  Ryan, great questions.
[03:39:12.993 --> 03:39:14.234]  We've got to move quick to get everybody here.
[03:39:14.234 --> 03:39:16.656]  Let's go to Sarah in California.
[03:39:16.656 --> 03:39:19.179]  Sarah, you're on the air with our guest.
[03:39:19.179 --> 03:39:20.480]  Go ahead.
[03:39:20.480 --> 03:39:20.660]  Hi!
[03:39:20.660 --> 03:39:22.902]  Lucky with the day I found Alex Jones.
[03:39:22.902 --> 03:39:25.124]  I just absolutely love your products.
[03:39:25.124 --> 03:39:25.585]  We love you.
[03:39:26.178 --> 03:39:28.019]  Believe me, it's amazing.
[03:39:28.019 --> 03:39:30.762]  But anyway, I have so much to say here and I know you don't have much time.
[03:39:30.762 --> 03:39:31.982]  We got time for you, sweetheart.
[03:39:31.982 --> 03:39:33.243]  Go ahead.
[03:39:33.243 --> 03:39:34.344]  Thank you.
[03:39:34.344 --> 03:39:36.406]  Zach, thank you so much.
[03:39:36.406 --> 03:39:42.791]  I'm from the industry and had to step out of the industry because I'm from the organic industry, meaning the real free market part.
[03:39:44.311 --> 03:39:49.112]  I work with research engines and a content provider with 250 copywriters.
[03:39:49.112 --> 03:39:50.113]  You know what I'm talking about.
[03:39:50.113 --> 03:39:54.914]  Yeah, you're getting absolutely hammered there in the nutraceutical and health spaces.
[03:39:54.914 --> 03:39:57.234]  It's really a bloodbath right now.
[03:39:57.234 --> 03:39:59.195]  Well, okay, I have a question for you.
[03:39:59.195 --> 03:40:05.776]  My question is, you said the most powerful statement when Alex asked you the other day, why did you do this?
[03:40:05.776 --> 03:40:11.438]  And you said, and you thought of every word, and I wrote it down, I had to go back, and I've listened to all of them at least 10 times.
[03:40:11.438 --> 03:40:12.578]  All of those videos, 10 times.
[03:40:13.303 --> 03:40:14.865]  Every word you said was intentional.
[03:40:14.865 --> 03:40:17.588]  If you break down every word, you're saying a lot.
[03:40:17.588 --> 03:40:28.822]  You said, I want to warn the American people, AI weapons are aimed directly at your mind, which actually exposes the emotion machine for frequency modulation.
[03:40:30.036 --> 03:40:31.157]  And so on and so forth.
[03:40:31.157 --> 03:40:34.700]  So I wanted you to elaborate in reference to the weapons.
[03:40:34.700 --> 03:40:40.945]  Is it frequency-based from Marvin Minsky's emotion machine working with the dopamine?
[03:40:40.945 --> 03:40:43.707]  The whole thing is a weapons system, that's what he's saying.
[03:40:43.707 --> 03:40:44.268]  Right, right.
[03:40:44.268 --> 03:40:56.278]  But specifically, what I specifically meant, and Dr. Robert Epstein, the former chief editor of Psychology Today, is mapping this out very well, and what he's mapped out is that the
[03:40:57.339 --> 03:41:04.145]  The search prediction in Google is one of the main ways that Google is aiming their AI weapons at our minds.
[03:41:04.145 --> 03:41:15.014]  And, you know, you can test this either by doing the Clinton body count or you can even just type in men can and it will autocomplete to men can have babies, men can have periods.
[03:41:15.014 --> 03:41:22.961]  And the thing is, is that if you believe that this is what the consensus is thinking, then you're going to go along with it because that's the way humans are.
[03:41:22.961 --> 03:41:23.402]  We're heard
[03:41:24.002 --> 03:41:24.322]  I'm good.
[03:41:45.672 --> 03:41:53.242]  Because if they get you to accept that a man can have a baby, and then Facebook banned a Republican ad saying, we want strong women.
[03:41:53.242 --> 03:41:54.904]  Oh, saying woman hurt me!
[03:41:54.904 --> 03:41:56.326]  I mean, that's a cult, man.
[03:41:56.326 --> 03:41:57.708]  That's a dangerous group.
[03:41:57.708 --> 03:41:58.990]  And they're not just freaks.
[03:41:58.990 --> 03:42:00.572]  They're killing the language.
[03:42:00.572 --> 03:42:02.815]  They're killing the biological power of humanity.
[03:42:03.075 --> 03:42:06.260]  Yeah, and they're trying to establish like a cult mentality, right?
[03:42:06.260 --> 03:42:13.111]  Where words don't mean the things that they used to and you have to look at everything through... You subserve so you can be on Twitter.
[03:42:13.111 --> 03:42:15.094]  You submit, you can be on Google.
[03:42:15.094 --> 03:42:15.415]  You know what?
[03:42:15.415 --> 03:42:16.977]  I'm not submitting to jack crap.
[03:42:17.896 --> 03:42:18.276]  Awesome.
[03:42:18.276 --> 03:42:20.257]  Yeah, neither am I, right?
[03:42:20.257 --> 03:42:25.459]  I came here to, you know, bust censorship open because I am anti-censorship.
[03:42:25.459 --> 03:42:30.621]  I believe in a free market for ideas and let the best idea win.
[03:42:30.621 --> 03:42:31.662]  Sounds like freedom to me.
[03:42:31.662 --> 03:42:32.422]  Sarah, thank you.
[03:42:32.422 --> 03:42:33.762]  Great points.
[03:42:33.762 --> 03:42:35.583]  We're going to rampage through every caller.
[03:42:35.583 --> 03:42:38.464]  George, Ronnie, Jason, John, Jeff, and Jefferson.
[03:42:38.464 --> 03:42:41.286]  And then this transmission ends and the war room begins.
[03:42:41.286 --> 03:42:41.906]  And this guy
[03:42:43.086 --> 03:42:47.119]  He's gonna eat a Caesar salad, and he's gonna go in and host a war with Will Johnson.
[03:42:47.119 --> 03:42:48.143]  And so that's coming up.
[03:42:48.143 --> 03:42:48.524]  Stay with us.
[03:42:52.367 --> 03:42:54.788]  One half of the incredible eight pack power staff.
[03:42:54.788 --> 03:42:58.971]  The AM wake up and work packet is exactly what you need to start your day right.
[03:42:58.971 --> 03:43:05.194]  The pack contains five original formulas built to fuel your day and take care of your body's individual needs in the morning.
[03:43:05.194 --> 03:43:08.816]  Targeting the heart, brain, muscles, energy production and more.
[03:43:08.816 --> 03:43:15.760]  Each AM pack contains a flex and joint support, energy kickstart, krill oil, nootropic brain and greens detox formula.
[03:43:16.580 --> 03:43:17.361]  With the P.M.
[03:43:17.361 --> 03:43:22.065]  pack in the eight pack power stack, you can rest easy and simplify your routine.
[03:43:22.065 --> 03:43:24.707]  Containing four original formulas, the P.M.
[03:43:24.707 --> 03:43:31.133]  rest and recover pack will build up your body's defenses and help you get restful, satisfying sleep every night.
[03:43:31.133 --> 03:43:35.496]  Containing bone support, krill oil, sound sleep and immune support formulas.
[03:43:35.496 --> 03:43:36.017]  The P.M.
[03:43:36.017 --> 03:43:41.882]  packet was created to support improving your body's bones and immune system all while you rest from the day's work.
[03:43:42.122 --> 03:43:52.211]  When combined with the AM wake up and work packet, it makes the eight pack power stack the new can't miss InfoWars life product.
[03:43:52.211 --> 03:43:57.035]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[03:43:58.348 --> 03:44:07.753]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[03:44:07.753 --> 03:44:19.399]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[03:44:19.399 --> 03:44:23.601]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[03:44:24.501 --> 03:44:28.543]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[03:44:28.543 --> 03:44:35.446]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[03:44:35.446 --> 03:44:38.367]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[03:44:38.367 --> 03:44:48.152]  Sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:52.608 --> 03:45:05.801]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[03:45:05.801 --> 03:45:08.704]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[03:45:08.704 --> 03:45:10.466]  farming goods a week ago.
[03:45:10.466 --> 03:45:14.109]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[03:45:14.750 --> 03:45:19.315]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[03:45:19.315 --> 03:45:20.335]  That's beautiful.
[03:45:20.335 --> 03:45:22.237]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[03:45:22.237 --> 03:45:23.859]  And we aren't going to back down.
[03:45:23.859 --> 03:45:31.446]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[03:45:31.446 --> 03:45:33.788]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[03:45:33.788 --> 03:45:37.952]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:45:37.952 --> 03:45:38.873]  And I'm asking listeners,
[03:45:39.654 --> 03:45:43.776]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[03:45:43.776 --> 03:45:44.877]  We are the resistance.
[03:45:44.877 --> 03:45:55.503]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[03:45:55.503 --> 03:45:58.945]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[03:45:58.945 --> 03:46:02.988]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:46:02.988 --> 03:46:07.070]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:46:07.070 --> 03:46:08.771]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[03:46:11.684 --> 03:46:14.545]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[03:46:14.545 --> 03:46:16.806]  It's a form of fascism.
[03:46:16.806 --> 03:46:20.568]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[03:46:20.568 --> 03:46:31.913]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:46:31.913 --> 03:46:35.335]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[03:46:43.502 --> 03:46:47.446]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:46:47.446 --> 03:46:48.828]  You can't watch this!
[03:46:48.828 --> 03:46:58.438]  The movie available now at InfowarsStore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:07.717 --> 03:47:10.258]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:10.258 --> 03:47:19.481]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:19.481 --> 03:47:23.843]  By the way, Zach Voorhees, doing a great job spilling his guts about Googles.
[03:47:23.843 --> 03:47:25.924]  He'll be back in studio tomorrow for another hour and a half.
[03:47:25.924 --> 03:47:28.085]  He was in the war room the last hour today.
[03:47:28.965 --> 03:47:32.487]  We've got the great Will Johnson guest hosting that.
[03:47:32.487 --> 03:47:33.867]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:47:33.867 --> 03:47:35.188]  But I want to get to all these calls before we end.
[03:47:35.188 --> 03:47:38.469]  But yeah, I went and got genetic testing at a top lab.
[03:47:38.469 --> 03:47:41.831]  And they told me, well, you got the Northern European thing, 40% have it.
[03:47:41.831 --> 03:47:45.793]  Your genes are turned off to be able to absorb B12.
[03:47:45.793 --> 03:47:47.233]  But mitochondria was real rare.
[03:47:47.233 --> 03:47:48.394]  It was operating at 100%.
[03:47:48.394 --> 03:47:50.975]  The problem is it was like getting energy into it.
[03:47:50.975 --> 03:47:52.196]  So kind of a mutant.
[03:47:52.196 --> 03:47:54.417]  It's very rare to have 100% operation of mitochondria.
[03:47:55.938 --> 03:47:59.981]  But then, it's like typo, negative, people have that sometimes.
[03:47:59.981 --> 03:48:04.785]  But then on top of it, I have trouble getting the energy into the cells though.
[03:48:04.785 --> 03:48:05.705]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:48:05.705 --> 03:48:15.052]  And I've got a genetic mutation, two copies, in the MTHFR gene, specifically called C667T.
[03:48:15.052 --> 03:48:21.437]  And for me, I'm able to bypass that with a special form of vitamin B9 called methylfolate.
[03:48:22.378 --> 03:48:22.938]  I've heard of that.
[03:48:22.938 --> 03:48:24.159]  We've been looking into that.
[03:48:24.159 --> 03:48:26.219]  So what did it do when you took it?
[03:48:26.219 --> 03:48:34.961]  What it does is it lowers the levels of homocysteine, which is an amino acid that builds up in each one of your cells because you can't produce enough methylfolate.
[03:48:34.961 --> 03:48:44.404]  And so by taking methylfolate directly, then you bypass the MTHFR gene that is... Bottom line, Mother Nature has some incredible stuff.
[03:48:44.404 --> 03:48:44.824]  Yeah.
[03:48:44.824 --> 03:48:47.925]  And as you were saying to the last caller, they're waging war on that.
[03:48:48.462 --> 03:49:05.108]  Yeah, they're trying to wage war on alternative health, and what Google's doing, which is very insidious, is that they are boosting non-credible, non-authored pages ahead of really well-researched papers on the Internet.
[03:49:05.108 --> 03:49:09.050]  What do you make of all the, even the Journal of American Medicine admitting fluoride lowers IQs?
[03:49:09.775 --> 03:49:23.019]  You know, the thing is that you've been beating that drum for years, and this was something that was really well known, and there's a lot of research internationally showing that fluoride lowers the IQ of particularly males.
[03:49:23.019 --> 03:49:32.702]  And now it's like, okay, well, I think the Journal of Pediatrics or something similar to that released a study saying that, yeah, like for each milligram of
[03:49:33.382 --> 03:49:40.347]  Fluoride found in the pregnant mom's urine, it like lowered the IQ by a certain amount.
[03:49:40.347 --> 03:49:42.428]  And they tested this and they found that it was true.
[03:49:42.428 --> 03:49:45.670]  And it's like, duh, this happens in like every single animal.
[03:49:45.670 --> 03:49:56.578]  And the problem with fluoride is that it binds to aluminum and your body's trying to detox aluminum, but the fluoride pulls it in and prevents it from being excreted.
[03:49:56.718 --> 03:49:57.958]  That's it.
[03:49:57.958 --> 03:50:00.459]  It's an adjuvant to make every other toxin stronger.
[03:50:00.459 --> 03:50:01.219]  Let's take some calls.
[03:50:01.219 --> 03:50:01.939]  We'll talk about it tomorrow.
[03:50:01.939 --> 03:50:02.819]  This is amazing.
[03:50:02.819 --> 03:50:05.460]  Jefferson in Virginia, you're on the air with a big whistleblower.
[03:50:05.460 --> 03:50:07.060]  Go ahead from Google.
[03:50:07.060 --> 03:50:07.941]  What's your take on this?
[03:50:07.941 --> 03:50:11.221]  And we'll go to George.
[03:50:11.221 --> 03:50:12.122]  Thank you, gentlemen.
[03:50:12.122 --> 03:50:14.962]  Zach, I have to say you are very brave to be doing what you're doing.
[03:50:14.962 --> 03:50:17.523]  I thank you as a patriot for America.
[03:50:17.523 --> 03:50:18.303]  Thank you.
[03:50:18.303 --> 03:50:19.723]  Thank you.
[03:50:19.723 --> 03:50:26.225]  My question is, how hard would it be technologically or software-wise for all the people that are on this blacklist at Google
[03:50:27.284 --> 03:50:39.530]  Yeah, so that's a really interesting question.
[03:50:39.530 --> 03:50:43.231]  First off, if you're on a blacklist, Google will deny that you're on a blacklist.
[03:50:43.231 --> 03:50:45.052]  They're not transparent about their blacklist.
[03:50:45.052 --> 03:50:47.974]  They deny that they even have blacklists at all.
[03:50:47.974 --> 03:50:50.495]  Even though you have a copy and you work there, they'll lie.
[03:50:50.495 --> 03:50:52.035]  Yeah, they'll lie about it.
[03:50:52.035 --> 03:50:54.657]  And so the question is, how do you get off the blacklist?
[03:50:55.777 --> 03:50:58.679]  You know, not even politicians are safe from this thing, right?
[03:50:58.679 --> 03:51:01.380]  So, you know, there's really nothing that you can do.
[03:51:01.380 --> 03:51:06.103]  And this is the reason why that I'm now going to the people, is because I couldn't change the company from within.
[03:51:06.103 --> 03:51:18.291]  I'm now going to the people, and I'm asking the people, the we the people, to let each other know that this is what's going on, to let your senators and congresspeople know that this is what's going on, and together as one force,
[03:51:19.051 --> 03:51:21.373]  We can make a change.
[03:51:21.373 --> 03:51:25.615]  And the thing is, is that it's going to have to be up to the politicians to make this change.
[03:51:25.615 --> 03:51:30.419]  Now, exactly what change needs to be done is something that's a little bit above me.
[03:51:30.419 --> 03:51:38.104]  Like, I personally believe in the free market, and I don't, you know, I think that Google was able to rise to power because of the distortion of the free market.
[03:51:38.104 --> 03:51:39.985]  But when they hijacked the whole thing, it's a fraud now.
[03:51:40.265 --> 03:51:41.185]  It's a fraud now, right?
[03:51:41.185 --> 03:51:50.629]  And so the thing is, is that, you know, if we allow the free market to flourish, then what's going to happen is that this is, I believe, going to just take care of itself.
[03:51:50.629 --> 03:51:54.490]  What about prohibiting the four big tech companies from buying any new companies for three years?
[03:51:56.222 --> 03:51:59.444]  Um, I think that that could be a step in the right direction.
[03:51:59.444 --> 03:52:02.245]  You know, some sort of, you know, anti-trust.
[03:52:02.245 --> 03:52:04.387]  Because new companies pop up, they just buy them.
[03:52:04.387 --> 03:52:05.087]  They just buy them.
[03:52:05.087 --> 03:52:10.710]  And then what they do is that they blacklist other, you know, apps out of the different app stores.
[03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:18.154]  You know, you can't get on Gab because Apple and the Play Store have forbidden it.
[03:52:18.154 --> 03:52:20.255]  And that's just anti-competitive.
[03:52:21.536 --> 03:52:27.520]  You know, they're now colluding as one big, you know, conglomerate, even though they pretend to be.
[03:52:27.520 --> 03:52:28.261]  One big bully.
[03:52:28.261 --> 03:52:29.241]  Jefferson, we've got to jump.
[03:52:29.241 --> 03:52:30.662]  We've got to come back tomorrow.
[03:52:30.662 --> 03:52:31.343]  It's going to be big.
[03:52:31.343 --> 03:52:32.644]  You're making great points.
[03:52:32.644 --> 03:52:36.206]  We should start the show with how do we counter against this and what are they doing wrong.
[03:52:36.206 --> 03:52:37.347]  Let's go to Georgia, Connecticut.
[03:52:37.347 --> 03:52:37.827]  You're on the air.
[03:52:37.827 --> 03:52:38.488]  Thanks for holding, George.
[03:52:40.215 --> 03:52:43.977]  I wanted to make a quick suggestion before I asked my question.
[03:52:43.977 --> 03:52:51.100]  I think you should give double points to anybody that gives like $50 or $100 straight up.
[03:52:51.100 --> 03:53:01.964]  That way, at some later stage when they want to buy products, maybe they have too much product right now, that way you keep the money flowing and at least they get something out of that.
[03:53:01.964 --> 03:53:03.365]  I think that would encourage a lot of people.
[03:53:03.365 --> 03:53:04.085]  Sounds like a great idea!
[03:53:04.645 --> 03:53:20.755]  Yeah, and another idea, I think you should put up a couple of t-shirts, one for white privilege or guilt question mark, and then put the MLL question, I thought it was the content of your character, not the color of your skin type of thing.
[03:53:20.755 --> 03:53:26.418]  I think it would be an absolute blockbuster, the picture of Martin Luther on the front and that quotation.
[03:53:26.418 --> 03:53:29.160]  I think almost everybody in America is sick and tired of this stuff.
[03:53:29.540 --> 03:53:31.462]  Or the Clinton body count on his shirt, right?
[03:53:31.462 --> 03:53:32.703]  I mean, politics is downstream from culture.
[03:53:51.400 --> 03:54:05.915]  Yeah, so the question type of suggestion I'm thinking of, why can't we get Zach and a few other people, like you've already mentioned on air, unfortunately I'm trying to run fast, I can't remember their name, but anyway, start a new NGO,
[03:54:06.776 --> 03:54:07.657]  Thank you so much, George.
[03:54:07.657 --> 03:54:08.617]  A lot of great points.
[03:54:34.457 --> 03:54:42.240]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to, moving quickly here, let's talk to Jason in New Mexico about an alternative to Google.
[03:54:42.240 --> 03:54:43.661]  Go ahead.
[03:54:43.661 --> 03:54:48.403]  He who controls the law, excuse me, he who controls the language, controls the learning of the law.
[03:54:48.403 --> 03:54:52.044]  Thank you, gentlemen, for bringing up this very valid, important topic.
[03:54:52.044 --> 03:54:54.965]  It's actually life-changing.
[03:54:54.965 --> 03:54:56.186]  One quick question, Zach.
[03:54:56.186 --> 03:54:59.247]  How do we get off the grid, per se, from Google?
[03:54:59.247 --> 03:55:00.587]  How do we get off of the Google grid?
[03:55:00.587 --> 03:55:01.988]  You talk about Google fasting.
[03:55:02.248 --> 03:55:04.909]  Yeah, you've got to do a Google Detox.
[03:55:04.909 --> 03:55:08.369]  So you've got to switch from Gmail to ProtonMail.
[03:55:08.369 --> 03:55:13.791]  You've got to switch from Google Search to DuckDuckGo or StartPage.
[03:55:13.791 --> 03:55:21.692]  You know, you need to turn off the location services on your phone because, you know, if you go to YouTube, they are getting your data at any point.
[03:55:21.692 --> 03:55:24.833]  And why give data to the enemy of America?
[03:55:25.433 --> 03:55:38.362]  You know, and so you got to identify all the different products that you're using and realize that every single time you use that product you're leaking metadata and they're vacuuming that up and they're selling it to God knows who across God knows what country.
[03:55:38.362 --> 03:55:41.284]  Some of them might be foreign adversaries to the United States.
[03:55:42.028 --> 03:55:52.473]  But how do we do that if our kids have to have Chromebooks to go to school, and then also if you go to some of the newer platforms, they say, well, try Google Chrome and then our site would work better.
[03:55:52.473 --> 03:55:54.194]  You see, it's kind of like they're hurting us.
[03:55:54.194 --> 03:55:55.054]  Sure, no, no, you're right.
[03:55:55.054 --> 03:55:55.594]  We're out of time.
[03:55:55.594 --> 03:55:56.635]  They force you into it.
[03:55:56.635 --> 03:55:57.295]  Yeah.
[03:55:57.295 --> 03:55:58.216]  You're getting ahead of yourself.
[03:55:58.216 --> 03:56:00.797]  Just start at something simple and work down.
[03:56:00.797 --> 03:56:01.117]  Exactly.
[03:56:01.117 --> 03:56:03.418]  You're not going to dominate it all up front, but just a 10% shift.
[03:56:05.419 --> 03:56:08.022]  Well, we'll start crippling this criminal organization.
[03:56:08.022 --> 03:56:11.805]  We've got a minute and 34 seconds, and I wanted to go to John and Ronnie.
[03:56:11.805 --> 03:56:12.766]  I got to most people.
[03:56:12.766 --> 03:56:13.827]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:56:13.827 --> 03:56:15.029]  You'll be in the studio.
[03:56:15.029 --> 03:56:15.949]  Get John's number.
[03:56:15.949 --> 03:56:16.730]  Get Ronnie's number.
[03:56:16.730 --> 03:56:18.372]  Guys, call them tomorrow.
[03:56:18.372 --> 03:56:19.613]  They'll go to that line.
[03:56:19.613 --> 03:56:23.817]  Well, you've got a well-deserved hour and a half break, and then you aren't going to be coming in.
[03:56:24.858 --> 03:56:25.838]  To the War Room today.
[03:56:25.838 --> 03:56:26.439]  Very exciting.
[03:56:26.439 --> 03:56:28.659]  Where do people find you right now?
[03:56:28.659 --> 03:56:37.802]  Alright, so the way that people can find me is they need to go on Twitter and they need to type in Perpetual Maniac or you can type in my name, Zach Voorhees.
[03:56:37.802 --> 03:56:38.802]  My last name's kind of weird.
[03:56:38.802 --> 03:56:40.403]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:56:40.403 --> 03:56:42.283]  It's right there on the screen.
[03:56:42.283 --> 03:56:50.426]  And I need people to follow me and I need people to retweet what I'm saying and help me stay alive by staying in the spotlight.
[03:56:50.666 --> 03:56:55.910]  I'm sacrificing everything that I have in order to bring this information to the public.
[03:56:55.910 --> 03:56:56.251]  That's right.
[03:56:56.251 --> 03:56:58.092]  They're betting that people are slaves.
[03:56:58.092 --> 03:57:01.495]  We're going to fade off and merge with machines and it's all over and we're just animals.
[03:57:01.495 --> 03:57:03.576]  You're betting we're humans and we're going to overcome this.
[03:57:03.576 --> 03:57:04.557]  We're going to overcome it.
[03:57:04.557 --> 03:57:06.159]  Okay, we're going to overcome it together.
[03:57:06.159 --> 03:57:12.924]  So I'm asking everyone to join me and let's do this together and let's change America and create a brand new life.
[03:57:13.184 --> 03:57:18.865]  And they don't feel bad when you don't see his numbers go up, because my son joined Twitter and had 10,002 hours and nobody after that.
[03:57:18.865 --> 03:57:19.886]  It's what they do.
[03:57:19.886 --> 03:57:22.346]  We just use all their platforms but build our own.
[03:57:22.346 --> 03:57:24.887]  You're going to be launching your own website soon, I hope?
[03:57:24.887 --> 03:57:28.287]  I have several websites, but I'm going to stay on Twitter just to keep it focused.
[03:57:28.287 --> 03:57:28.847]  No, I understand.
[03:57:28.847 --> 03:57:29.668]  I understand.
[03:57:29.668 --> 03:57:30.028]  All right.
[03:57:30.028 --> 03:57:30.768]  Well, thank you.
[03:57:30.768 --> 03:57:32.388]  Great job, crew.
[03:57:32.388 --> 03:57:33.569]  He'll be back with us tomorrow.
[03:57:33.569 --> 03:57:35.129]  Coming up, The War Room.
[03:57:35.129 --> 03:57:37.809]  Straight ahead at infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:57:37.809 --> 03:57:38.870]  Thank you all for joining us.
[03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:40.150]  Thank you all for doing the most important thing.
