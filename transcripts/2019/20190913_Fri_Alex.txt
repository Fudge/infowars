[00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:21.950]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:33.383]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:36.227]  Ladies and gentlemen, what we witnessed last night
[00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:46.863]  The 5th debate by the Democrats, all 10 of them on the stage at the same time, was an open declaration of war against everything this nation stands for.
[00:00:46.863 --> 00:00:49.804]  It was offering everybody all this free pirate booty.
[00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:54.865]  It was saying we're going to confiscate 90% of the guns in this country are semi-automatic.
[00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:56.466]  They want to go down to only single shot.
[00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:02.035]  This is everything we knew was coming all along in their internal documents.
[00:01:02.035 --> 00:01:11.560]  I've got all these clips coming up of Joe Biden saying, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, 3 years ago, nobody wants your guns, nobody's going after your rifle, your shotgun, your semi-auto.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.961]  That's a lie of the Republicans.
[00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:14.702]  That's a lie of the NRA.
[00:01:14.702 --> 00:01:18.964]  Now, all of them pledging to take the guns.
[00:01:18.964 --> 00:01:20.405]  And they keep saying, get them off the streets.
[00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:23.146]  They mean come to your house and confiscate them.
[00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:24.547]  And then Beto O'Rourke,
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:40.090]  Beto O'Rourke, the hit-and-run criminal, the guy that wrote essays about murdering children, the guy that puts cheeseburgers on English muffins, the guy that you couldn't trust with anything.
[00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.353]  Well, here he is throwing down the gauntlet.
[00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:50.718]  Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.
[00:01:50.718 --> 00:01:52.720]  You know the critics call this confiscation.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.562]  Are you proposing taking away their guns and how would this work?
[00:01:56.647 --> 00:01:57.287]  I am.
[00:01:57.287 --> 00:02:04.710]  If it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield.
[00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:18.455]  If the high-impact, high-velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body because it was designed to do that so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers.
[00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:21.236]  When we see that being used against children,
[00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:27.739]  And in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15.
[00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.502]  And that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15.
[00:02:33.502 --> 00:02:38.365]  In Odessa, in Midland, there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time.
[00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:40.066]  Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:45.729]  We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.
[00:02:48.283 --> 00:02:51.145]  Everything he said there, of course, is a twisted lie.
[00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:54.667]  I mean, there are more people dying every year getting stabbed to death than beaten with baseball bats.
[00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:57.768]  The highest crime rates are where they've taken all the guns from law-abiding.
[00:02:57.768 --> 00:02:58.969]  We know all this.
[00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:07.614]  But he appeals to emotion, and then they all agreed, and the media made Beto, polling at less than 1%, the star.
[00:03:07.614 --> 00:03:09.775]  And now they're promising to come after your guns.
[00:03:09.775 --> 00:03:11.356]  This would cause, obviously, a civil war.
[00:03:11.356 --> 00:03:14.358]  It's how the country was founded, when the British Redcoats came to take the guns.
[00:03:15.404 --> 00:03:16.204]  It's simply insane.
[00:03:16.204 --> 00:03:26.088]  We come back, we've got a compilation of more of them saying this, and we've got Joe Biden promising just a few years ago that nobody's coming to take your guns.
[00:03:26.088 --> 00:03:33.171]  I knew he'd said it five years ago, ten years ago, but we've got video of him just a few years ago on C-SPAN saying the same thing.
[00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.912]  They've always wanted to get the guns.
[00:03:35.912 --> 00:03:36.532]  We know that.
[00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:41.534]  We understand that it has nothing to do with the 300 people a year that die in, quote, mass shootings.
[00:03:41.534 --> 00:03:42.535]  Less than 200 of those are
[00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.511]  Actually, what you call a classical real mass shooting where the guy goes out to do it.
[00:03:47.511 --> 00:03:50.373]  Some people get caught in crossfire of gang related stuff.
[00:03:50.373 --> 00:03:57.616]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, that being shot in this country by a criminal is way down the list, depending on the world almanac every year.
[00:03:57.616 --> 00:04:04.238]  It's 15, 16, 17, 18th way people die unnaturally in this country.
[00:04:04.238 --> 00:04:06.899]  You know, the worst back in the 80s, we had a big crime wave.
[00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:07.740]  It was like number 10.
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:18.624]  And the statistics vary, but I've had John Lott and top professors on who are just widely renowned as some of the top statisticians there are, and they'll tell you that, but we all know that.
[00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:25.166]  And we all know crime is located mainly in the crime-infested areas that the left controls.
[00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:29.148]  And so this was just amazing, and you know, they want to kill babies after they're born now, they're doing it.
[00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:31.800]  And the left celebrates abortion.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.262]  Boy, they really love life, don't they?
[00:04:33.262 --> 00:04:34.763]  But they want you disarmed.
[00:04:34.763 --> 00:04:38.607]  They want to finish their conquest of criminal fraud against us.
[00:04:38.607 --> 00:04:42.250]  They have the New York Times worshipping Mao Zedong and all of his mass murder.
[00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.232]  These people are authoritarians.
[00:04:44.232 --> 00:04:46.654]  And they're trying to bankrupt and collapse this nation.
[00:04:46.654 --> 00:04:49.296]  They're trying to fight the recovery that Trump's pushing.
[00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:51.218]  These people are the plague.
[00:04:51.218 --> 00:04:52.379]  They're globalists.
[00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:53.300]  And they hate this nation.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.900]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.461]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:58.726 --> 00:05:02.967]  We sold Secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third best seller.
[00:05:02.967 --> 00:05:07.748]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[00:05:07.748 --> 00:05:09.989]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:14.370]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.471]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:21.291]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:22.592]  Helps make DNA.
[00:05:22.592 --> 00:05:23.912]  Helps the body produce energy.
[00:05:23.912 --> 00:05:25.412]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[00:05:25.412 --> 00:05:27.413]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[00:05:27.413 --> 00:05:28.173]  It goes on and on.
[00:05:28.393 --> 00:05:36.496]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:39.036]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[00:05:39.036 --> 00:05:45.879]  It helps fund the InfoWar, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:51.200]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.482]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:06:00.424 --> 00:06:05.431]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:22.775]  Well, we're getting a compilation of Joe Biden 12 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, 2 years ago, saying nobody wants your guns, nobody's putting you in a database to confiscate them, special forces troops aren't coming to get them, not your rifle, not your shotgun, not any of them.
[00:06:22.775 --> 00:06:37.237]  But here's a clip from just a few years ago of Biden, and then we'll play you some excerpts from last night when the Democrats let it all hang out that they want to finish their conquest of the United States and fully disarm us.
[00:06:38.743 --> 00:06:43.727]  No central registry for anything.
[00:06:43.727 --> 00:06:55.218]  No way that Uncle Sam can go find out whether you own a gun because we're about to really take away all your rights and you're not going to be able to defend yourself.
[00:06:55.218 --> 00:07:02.004]  We're going to swoop down with special forces folks and gather up every gun in America.
[00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:04.446]  It's bizarre.
[00:07:04.446 --> 00:07:05.867]  But that's what's being sold out there.
[00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:12.637]  All we're suggesting is to be able to add to the existing system.
[00:07:12.637 --> 00:07:14.240]  No information.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.524]  We're not adding any more information.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.904]  Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street, period.
[00:07:23.904 --> 00:07:26.987]  And we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements.
[00:07:26.987 --> 00:07:33.832]  In recent days, former Vice President Biden has said about executive orders, some really talented people are seeking the nomination.
[00:07:33.832 --> 00:07:35.474]  They said, I'm going to issue an executive order.
[00:07:35.474 --> 00:07:41.439]  Biden's saying there's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say, I'm going to eliminate assault weapons.
[00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:42.880]  Does the Vice President have a point there?
[00:07:43.526 --> 00:07:49.451]  I mean, I would just say, hey Joe, instead of saying no we can't, let's say yes we can.
[00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:54.335]  Let's be constitutional.
[00:07:54.335 --> 00:07:57.517]  And yes we can, because I'll tell you something.
[00:07:57.517 --> 00:08:00.920]  Well, do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:06.725]  I said, well look, I mean obviously he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.
[00:08:07.318 --> 00:08:10.762]  By the way, you can't own the following weapons, period.
[00:08:10.762 --> 00:08:12.764]  They cannot be sold anymore.
[00:08:12.764 --> 00:08:19.791]  You said, quote, Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.
[00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.794]  You know the critics call this confiscation.
[00:08:21.794 --> 00:08:24.637]  Are you proposing taking away their guns and how would this work?
[00:08:25.726 --> 00:08:28.948]  I am, if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people.
[00:08:28.948 --> 00:08:29.949]  Hell yes!
[00:08:29.949 --> 00:08:31.349]  We're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[00:08:31.349 --> 00:08:37.513]  We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.
[00:08:37.513 --> 00:08:40.135]  Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban.
[00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:47.697]  Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which, by the way, would have made a huge difference if that was in place.
[00:08:47.697 --> 00:08:50.540]  They know full well you have a couple hundred people killed a year in mass shootings.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.461]  It's super rare.
[00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:52.101]  They hype it up.
[00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:53.763]  That actually causes more people to do it.
[00:08:53.763 --> 00:08:54.584]  They're hoping for it.
[00:08:54.584 --> 00:08:56.566]  These are criminals that want to disarm their slaves.
[00:08:56.906 --> 00:08:58.027]  They're fully aware of what they're doing.
[00:08:58.027 --> 00:09:04.193]  They don't talk about the 200,000 dead in Mexico the last 10 years, where they have a total ban on guns for citizens, but one of the highest crime rates in the world.
[00:09:04.193 --> 00:09:06.675]  Chicago, ban on guns, highest crime rate in the U.S.
[00:09:06.675 --> 00:09:08.196]  These dirtbags know what they're doing.
[00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:09.157]  They're not idiots.
[00:09:09.157 --> 00:09:13.141]  They're wanton frontmen of international criminals that want to enslave this nation.
[00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:16.604]  1776 is why this country started, when the Redcoats came to take the guns.
[00:09:16.604 --> 00:09:22.810]  And if they try to take our firearms, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:27.292]  It doesn't matter how many freaking lemons you get out there telling us that we've got to be your slaves.
[00:09:27.292 --> 00:09:28.052]  We're not!
[00:09:28.052 --> 00:09:29.552]  Get it through your head!
[00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:36.655]  New Supreme.
[00:09:36.655 --> 00:09:38.336]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:38.336 --> 00:09:40.016]  That's from the YouTube channel New Supreme.
[00:09:40.016 --> 00:09:40.757]  Those are some good guys.
[00:09:40.757 --> 00:09:44.238]  I'm going to get them on the show sometime and put some good compilations out.
[00:09:44.238 --> 00:09:49.060]  So many great patriots out there.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:49.620]  Here's the deal.
[00:09:51.513 --> 00:10:03.597]  Back in the 60s, the United Nations, the Carnegie Endowment, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Endowment, the guys that set up the UN, the guys that set up this world government system, they went on national news.
[00:10:03.597 --> 00:10:05.778]  They went in the New York Times.
[00:10:05.778 --> 00:10:16.862]  Somewhere in our warehouse storage area, I've got a whole binder that was put together by a research group out in California.
[00:10:16.862 --> 00:10:19.023]  They had all the old New York Times and Washington Post.
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.361]  Articles saying the UN will occupy America.
[00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:26.421]  All guns will be taken.
[00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:28.721]  There will be no single-family homes.
[00:10:28.721 --> 00:10:32.542]  Everyone will live in dormitory high-rise buildings.
[00:10:32.542 --> 00:10:35.583]  We will blur the sexes.
[00:10:35.583 --> 00:10:38.203]  We will sterilize people.
[00:10:38.203 --> 00:10:41.864]  And so they tried to come out with this in the 60s.
[00:10:41.864 --> 00:10:46.465]  And people are like, this is insane.
[00:10:46.465 --> 00:10:47.605]  And so they pulled back.
[00:10:48.496 --> 00:11:00.540]  And then, for the 70s and 80s and 90s, said, oh, none of this exists, crazy people are saying it.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.880]  But it was always their plan.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.801]  So people keep asking, Alex, how is it all coming true?
[00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:06.482]  How did you know this?
[00:11:06.482 --> 00:11:11.123]  It's like going to a play on Broadway.
[00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:17.694]  And you get a program, and it shows you the third act, the second act, the first act.
[00:11:17.694 --> 00:11:28.521]  And you start at the first act, and it tells you whether you're watching Romeo and Juliet, or whether you're watching Cats, or Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.
[00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:32.163]  I mean, whatever it is, you know how the play goes.
[00:11:32.163 --> 00:11:35.445]  It's a program.
[00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:36.986]  General Parton would always explain that to me.
[00:11:36.986 --> 00:11:39.747]  He goes, Jones, you can get caught in the minutia all day.
[00:11:39.747 --> 00:11:40.508]  It's a program.
[00:11:41.792 --> 00:11:47.355]  It's ultra-rich using a communist model to get rid of free market capitalism and create a consolidation.
[00:11:47.355 --> 00:11:50.737]  You've got to understand the communist program.
[00:11:50.737 --> 00:11:53.798]  And they're following a program, culture war, race war, all of this.
[00:11:53.798 --> 00:11:59.861]  And the big rich billionaires set off short tax exempt, orchestrating all of this, making fun of us.
[00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:02.823]  And Trump comes along and tries to stop it and all hell breaks loose.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.521]  The Democrats say they want to arrest conservatives.
[00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:09.143]  They say they want to put us in forced labor camps.
[00:12:09.143 --> 00:12:10.404]  They say they want to kill us.
[00:12:10.404 --> 00:12:17.289]  They say they want to flatten us and demolish us and destroy us.
[00:12:17.289 --> 00:12:21.291]  And they do it over and over and over again.
[00:12:21.291 --> 00:12:23.653]  And sure, it sounds extreme to say all this.
[00:12:23.653 --> 00:12:28.036]  It sounded pretty extreme in 1939 when Hitler invaded Poland too.
[00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.653]  But when you get hit by something, you know, it's pretty extreme to come home and there's a home invader in your house.
[00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:36.094]  That happened once when we came home from church.
[00:12:36.094 --> 00:12:41.257]  When I was a kid, the guy ran out the back door, scared the hell out of my mom.
[00:12:41.257 --> 00:12:43.698]  My dad was taking groceries in.
[00:12:43.698 --> 00:12:46.740]  He came in, I mean, you know, it's like having a car wreck.
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.941]  Can't believe you had it.
[00:12:48.941 --> 00:12:51.142]  You look over and your arm's chopped off and blood's squirting.
[00:12:51.142 --> 00:12:52.223]  You gotta put a tourniquet on it.
[00:12:52.223 --> 00:12:54.204]  I mean, this is the real world, folks.
[00:12:54.204 --> 00:12:58.767]  We got a case, a hardcore, globalist, communist-funded, Marxist-Leninist,
[00:12:59.952 --> 00:13:01.852]  Saul Alinsky cancer.
[00:13:01.852 --> 00:13:08.914]  And if we don't cut the stuff out, it's gonna go all the way, because it's what it does.
[00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:16.696]  So, a normal person sits back and watches all this and can't believe it.
[00:13:16.696 --> 00:13:23.217]  And that's because it doesn't make sense, because you're not a psychotic control freak, lusting after total power and control.
[00:13:23.217 --> 00:13:25.278]  I mean, the biggest thing of the night didn't get any attention.
[00:13:26.035 --> 00:13:32.159]  Kamala Harris said, as a president, you need to sign an executive order to confiscate all the guns.
[00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:33.360]  And he says, well, you can't do that.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.561]  It's got to be a law.
[00:13:34.561 --> 00:13:38.303]  Even Congress can't violate the Second Amendment until the Supreme Court comes in.
[00:13:38.303 --> 00:13:40.644]  But it certainly doesn't come from the executive.
[00:13:40.644 --> 00:13:43.526]  She calls for a dictatorship to Joe Biden.
[00:13:43.526 --> 00:13:45.227]  He says, we can't do that in the Constitution.
[00:13:45.227 --> 00:13:47.369]  She says, oh, just say yes, we can.
[00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:48.289]  It's so creepy.
[00:13:48.289 --> 00:13:49.670]  It's so skexy-like.
[00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.831]  It's so over-the-top.
[00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:51.972]  Here is that clip.
[00:13:52.594 --> 00:13:59.417]  In recent days, former Vice President Biden has said about executive orders, some really talented people are seeking the nomination.
[00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:01.057]  They said, I'm going to issue an executive order.
[00:14:01.057 --> 00:14:13.342]  Biden's saying there's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say, I'm going to eliminate assault weapons, saying you can't do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive order.
[00:14:13.342 --> 00:14:15.143]  Does the vice president have a point there?
[00:14:15.143 --> 00:14:16.783]  Some things you can.
[00:14:16.783 --> 00:14:17.603]  Many things you can't.
[00:14:17.603 --> 00:14:18.784]  Let's let the senator answer.
[00:14:19.805 --> 00:14:25.748]  I mean, I would just say, hey Joe, instead of saying no we can't, let's say yes we can.
[00:14:25.748 --> 00:14:30.831]  Let's be constitutional.
[00:14:30.831 --> 00:14:33.952]  And yes we can, because I'll tell you something.
[00:14:33.952 --> 00:14:42.016]  The way that I think about this is, I've seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you.
[00:14:42.016 --> 00:14:45.058]  I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you.
[00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:51.070]  I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you.
[00:14:52.641 --> 00:15:12.458]  And the idea that we would wait for this Congress, which has just done nothing to act, is just, it is overlooking the fact that every day in America, our babies are going to school to have drills.
[00:15:12.458 --> 00:15:14.420]  Elementary, middle, and high school students.
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:20.145]  Yeah, because you guys had your one smash shooting, you hyped it up, and now you get copycats to do it.
[00:15:20.825 --> 00:15:22.707]  This is how you terrorize us, you damn terrorist!
[00:15:22.707 --> 00:15:24.348]  She was definitely on downers or alcohol.
[00:15:24.348 --> 00:15:25.729]  Everybody's saying she was drunk.
[00:15:25.729 --> 00:15:26.350]  She's choking!
[00:15:39.853 --> 00:15:42.114]  It is traumatizing our children.
[00:15:42.114 --> 00:15:47.657]  El Paso, and Beto, God love you for standing so bravely.
[00:15:47.657 --> 00:15:49.478]  Oh, Beto, oh, God love you.
[00:15:49.478 --> 00:15:51.158]  We'll disarm these slaves.
[00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:54.140]  More on her on the other side, getting into all this.
[00:15:58.001 --> 00:15:59.222]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:15:59.222 --> 00:16:03.143]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:03.143 --> 00:16:04.684]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:04.684 --> 00:16:07.646]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:07.646 --> 00:16:13.208]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:13.208 --> 00:16:14.409]  I can help you, too.
[00:16:14.409 --> 00:16:17.350]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.571]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:16:19.571 --> 00:16:24.013]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:16:24.013 --> 00:16:26.294]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[00:16:27.615 --> 00:16:31.476]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the US.
[00:16:31.476 --> 00:16:36.478]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[00:16:55.064 --> 00:16:57.366]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[00:16:57.366 --> 00:17:01.910]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.011]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:05.733]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:12.298]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:17.382]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:17:17.382 --> 00:17:21.305]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't
[00:17:21.305 --> 00:17:22.505]  Don't do it alone.
[00:17:22.505 --> 00:17:25.606]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[00:17:25.606 --> 00:17:32.627]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.

[00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:48.391]  800-506-6740 That's 800-506-6740
[00:17:58.717 --> 00:18:02.940]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.704]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[00:18:07.704 --> 00:18:09.965]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[00:18:09.965 --> 00:18:11.947]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12.
[00:18:11.947 --> 00:18:14.349]  The very best vitamin B12 out there.
[00:18:14.349 --> 00:18:19.432]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:21.254]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[00:18:21.254 --> 00:18:22.555]  Helps make DNA.
[00:18:22.555 --> 00:18:23.896]  Helps the body produce energy.
[00:18:23.896 --> 00:18:25.377]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[00:18:25.377 --> 00:18:27.398]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:28.139]  It goes on and on.
[00:18:28.619 --> 00:18:36.466]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[00:18:36.466 --> 00:18:39.008]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[00:18:39.008 --> 00:18:45.854]  It helps fund the InfoWar, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:18:45.854 --> 00:18:51.178]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[00:18:51.178 --> 00:18:56.423]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now on InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:18:59.133 --> 00:19:06.555]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you, the products at Infowarslife.com are.
[00:19:06.555 --> 00:19:19.859]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:27.003]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[00:19:27.003 --> 00:19:28.764]  It sells itself.
[00:19:28.764 --> 00:19:37.670]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:38.890]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[00:19:40.151 --> 00:19:51.734]  Bodies Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[00:19:51.734 --> 00:19:55.115]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[00:19:55.115 --> 00:20:01.837]  50% off on Bodies at Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:01.837 --> 00:20:04.478]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:18.686 --> 00:20:21.188]  There are going to be more stabbings.
[00:20:21.188 --> 00:20:23.550]  There are going to be more people running over others with cars.
[00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.073]  There's going to be more people that poison their husbands and wives.
[00:20:27.073 --> 00:20:28.414]  There's going to be more child molesters.
[00:20:28.414 --> 00:20:33.698]  There's going to be more babies by the millions aborted and hundreds of thousands kept alive with their organs sold.
[00:20:33.698 --> 00:20:38.042]  China is going to continue to have two million plus people in Mongolia in forced labor camps.
[00:20:40.106 --> 00:20:43.029]  Communism killed over 100 million people last century.
[00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:44.771]  The number's close to 200 million.
[00:20:44.771 --> 00:20:54.721]  All that's going on, but Beto O'Rourke and all them know that their constituents are very stupid and very childlike and very ignorant, so they can seize on individual events.
[00:20:55.382 --> 00:21:11.521]  And say, look at this terrible thing that happened when another Antifa individual, the man in Ohio, the man in Texas, both were leftists, they were both Antifa, but they covered up the El Paso shooter's pages that said that, and put up fake info the day of the shooting, after it happened.
[00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:12.182]  What a scandal!
[00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:24.903]  Let's see, InfoWars has been isolated to AM and FM radio, some TV stations, and a big presence at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, but not to a wider audience.
[00:21:24.903 --> 00:21:31.031]  To the choir, to you that's awake and informed, yes, you understand what's happening.
[00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:36.125]  You saw that seven minute compilation of Democrats saying, we love killing babies.
[00:21:36.125 --> 00:21:37.125]  They are babies.
[00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:38.266]  Those little bastards.
[00:21:38.266 --> 00:21:41.047]  We love the power of killing little boys and little girls.
[00:21:41.047 --> 00:21:42.268]  We like keeping them alive.
[00:21:42.268 --> 00:21:43.488]  We like bullying them.
[00:21:43.488 --> 00:21:45.349]  It makes us feel good and selfish.
[00:21:45.349 --> 00:21:46.149]  We love Satan.
[00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:50.111]  And then we showed you mainline news where they're actually doing it.
[00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:52.452]  They're not just trying to shock us.
[00:21:52.452 --> 00:21:56.074]  Every culture, when it starts to collapse, brings back child sacrifice.
[00:21:56.074 --> 00:21:56.694]  Every culture!
[00:21:57.551 --> 00:22:01.792]  Because there's a spirit in the world that has a hunger for it.
[00:22:01.792 --> 00:22:11.576]  Christ said, better you to kill yourself by tying a boulder around your neck and throwing yourself in the ocean, than to hurt children.
[00:22:11.576 --> 00:22:16.958]  And he said, those that do are reserved the greatest spiritual punishment.
[00:22:16.958 --> 00:22:18.818]  You're like, well, why would you need to have that?
[00:22:18.818 --> 00:22:19.779]  Christ admonishing.
[00:22:19.779 --> 00:22:21.399]  I don't want to hurt kids.
[00:22:21.399 --> 00:22:22.860]  Well, there are people that do.
[00:22:26.806 --> 00:22:28.347]  Demons haven't been very kind to him.
[00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:31.589]  Look at O'Rourke, a tortured, psychotic demon.
[00:22:31.589 --> 00:22:33.391]  Look at Sanders.
[00:22:33.391 --> 00:22:35.312]  Look at all of them.
[00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:38.875]  Spiritually hunchbacked, twisted.
[00:22:38.875 --> 00:22:42.597]  Absolutely out of control.
[00:22:42.597 --> 00:22:43.798]  Think about Kamala Harris.
[00:22:43.798 --> 00:22:45.279]  I just played that clip.
[00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:47.521]  Oh, there's the Constitution.
[00:22:47.521 --> 00:22:49.202]  We can't just have the president be a dictator.
[00:22:49.202 --> 00:22:55.326]  She says, yes, we can't do it for the little girl.
[00:22:55.326 --> 00:22:56.227]  They're taking our voice.
[00:22:57.671 --> 00:22:59.372]  They're attacking our families.
[00:22:59.372 --> 00:23:00.673]  They want our right to defend ourselves.
[00:23:00.673 --> 00:23:04.735]  Of course gun sales are up 15%.
[00:23:04.735 --> 00:23:09.058]  Because this country's been flooded with tens of millions of illegal aliens, many of them criminals.
[00:23:09.058 --> 00:23:15.461]  We've been flooded with enough fentanyl in just one shipment to kill 10 million people.
[00:23:15.461 --> 00:23:18.103]  Plus, there are drug addicts everywhere.
[00:23:18.103 --> 00:23:22.305]  Homelessness is exploding and almost all these homeless are on opiates.
[00:23:22.305 --> 00:23:25.107]  And again, we're trying to do something, you're trying to do something, Trump's trying to do something.
[00:23:26.476 --> 00:23:33.320]  But we're a cursed nation because we kill our unborn and now of course we kill them after they're born.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:39.964]  And of course we euthanize old people now who aren't even brain dead and who are begging for their lives.
[00:23:39.964 --> 00:23:43.006]  Because we've become demonic.
[00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:47.409]  Not all of us, but a good portion of us.
[00:23:47.409 --> 00:23:49.130]  Look at these headlines.
[00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.991]  Civic Survey, National Survey.
[00:23:52.492 --> 00:23:54.073]  Studyfinds.org.
[00:23:54.073 --> 00:23:56.694]  One in five Americans can't name a single branch of U.S.
[00:23:56.694 --> 00:23:59.675]  government.
[00:23:59.675 --> 00:24:00.375]  One in five.
[00:24:00.375 --> 00:24:01.275]  Who do you think those are?
[00:24:01.275 --> 00:24:04.457]  Those are the chief Democrat voters.
[00:24:04.457 --> 00:24:09.459]  They don't know how anything works.
[00:24:09.459 --> 00:24:14.861]  You can't tell them, hey, Mexico has a homicide rate nine times the U.S.
[00:24:14.861 --> 00:24:17.462]  The last numbers are from 2018.
[00:24:17.462 --> 00:24:20.163]  Two hundred plus thousand that we know of dead.
[00:24:20.163 --> 00:24:20.983]  Millions missing.
[00:24:23.988 --> 00:24:25.329]  Total gunman for the citizens.
[00:24:25.329 --> 00:24:34.115]  And I'm going to tell you when we come back from break how to stop this and how to defeat it.
[00:24:34.115 --> 00:24:39.759]  Versus what's going to happen if they go down the path they're on that will lead to civil war, which is part of their plan as well.
[00:24:39.759 --> 00:24:42.280]  Then they'll call you domestic terrorists.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.882]  And they'll stage events to blame on gun owner groups.
[00:24:44.882 --> 00:24:47.664]  Oh, they've got a plan, but we know the plan.
[00:24:47.664 --> 00:24:48.424]  We know how to stop it.
[00:24:48.424 --> 00:24:49.265]  This is really happening.
[00:24:50.971 --> 00:24:51.892]  And people get that now.
[00:24:51.892 --> 00:24:54.374]  They know, wait, Jones wasn't, this wasn't hyperbole over the years.
[00:24:54.374 --> 00:24:55.695]  He wasn't trying to shock.
[00:24:55.695 --> 00:24:56.135]  No, no, no.
[00:24:56.135 --> 00:24:57.256]  I'm not trying to shock anybody.
[00:24:57.256 --> 00:25:00.578]  The reality is what I want you to face.
[00:25:00.578 --> 00:25:04.281]  We can beat this.
[00:25:04.281 --> 00:25:15.109]  But here is, again, more of that exchange where Kamala is worshipping Beto, who looks like out of a horror movie, you know, the evil psychos that run the mortuary and are torturing people.
[00:25:15.109 --> 00:25:17.751]  I mean, he looks like he could star in a horror movie.
[00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:22.013]  As a serial killer, he just radiates evil and his actions are incredible.
[00:25:22.013 --> 00:25:23.414]  Totally fake.
[00:25:23.414 --> 00:25:27.977]  He does all this weird human stuff like changing tires, getting haircuts, cooking hamburgers wrong.
[00:25:27.977 --> 00:25:29.639]  I mean, there's something wrong with him.
[00:25:29.639 --> 00:25:30.319]  Is he a robot?
[00:25:30.319 --> 00:25:30.800]  An alien?
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.280]  No.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.942]  He's a sociopath.
[00:25:33.942 --> 00:25:36.644]  He's a robot that just wants power.
[00:25:36.644 --> 00:25:42.088]  It's genetic.
[00:25:42.088 --> 00:25:46.312]  There's chromosomal issues, there's disorders that create genetic psychopaths.
[00:25:47.196 --> 00:25:49.337]  You look at Zuckerberg, he has the characteristics.
[00:25:49.337 --> 00:25:50.818]  Nothing against tall, skinny people.
[00:25:50.818 --> 00:25:51.898]  A lot of them are great people.
[00:25:51.898 --> 00:25:59.282]  But there's certain types of genetic disorders, two of them, and I can pull it up and show you, where they're very tall, very skinny, and have that look.
[00:25:59.282 --> 00:26:01.943]  They could be black, they could be white.
[00:26:01.943 --> 00:26:05.925]  It's disproportionately associated with being a psychopath.
[00:26:05.925 --> 00:26:09.427]  Like the character in American Psycho, or Christian Bale.
[00:26:10.843 --> 00:26:12.564]  That's why you think of that as the psychopath.
[00:26:12.564 --> 00:26:18.487]  That look in the eyes, the buck teeth, all of that is a genetic psychopath.
[00:26:18.487 --> 00:26:22.509]  And it deals with double chromosomes.
[00:26:22.509 --> 00:26:23.610]  Look it up.
[00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.391]  Look up genetic psychopaths.
[00:26:26.391 --> 00:26:28.792]  And double chromosomes.
[00:26:28.792 --> 00:26:30.954]  Guaranteed he's got a double chromosome.
[00:26:30.954 --> 00:26:33.155]  He's a genetic psychopath.
[00:26:34.008 --> 00:26:36.269]  Which the base floor is sociopathic behavior.
[00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:43.432]  And they always try to show you, like you're trying to lure a puppy in, or, you know, bait deer in by hitting antlers together.
[00:26:43.432 --> 00:26:52.295]  They're hunting you, so they always go, look, I'm non-violent, I'm helpful, I love you, I care about you, I want to work with you.
[00:26:52.295 --> 00:26:55.116]  Look, I'm normal, look, I'm having a beer, I'm like you.
[00:26:55.116 --> 00:26:57.717]  You're like, that's totally fake.
[00:26:57.717 --> 00:26:59.278]  Because they have no empathy.
[00:26:59.278 --> 00:27:01.539]  But they put on the act of empathy.
[00:27:02.472 --> 00:27:03.873]  And it's very canned.
[00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:07.737]  It's very artificial.
[00:27:07.737 --> 00:27:10.839]  Because these people are obsessed.
[00:27:10.839 --> 00:27:11.500]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.821]  The psycho gene.
[00:27:12.821 --> 00:27:13.922]  And there's more than just that.
[00:27:13.922 --> 00:27:15.984]  There's several disorders that cause it.
[00:27:15.984 --> 00:27:19.507]  And again, very tall, skinny, that whole look.
[00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:23.410]  And again, that's not saying people that normally are tall and skinny are like that.
[00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.651]  It's very rare.
[00:27:24.651 --> 00:27:28.212]  But it's most of your real psychopaths are genetic psychopaths.
[00:27:28.212 --> 00:27:32.074]  That's why they're tall, skinny, have the high cheekbones, the buck teeth.
[00:27:32.074 --> 00:27:33.474]  It's a disorder.
[00:27:33.474 --> 00:27:35.235]  Like Down syndrome, you'll have an extra chromosome.
[00:27:35.235 --> 00:27:37.736]  Well, these guys have double chromosomes.
[00:27:37.736 --> 00:27:39.857]  And it causes the lengthening.
[00:27:39.857 --> 00:27:41.178]  But let's go to that clip I was talking about.
[00:27:41.178 --> 00:27:41.398]  Here it is.
[00:27:42.432 --> 00:27:47.815]  And by the way, the way Beto handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful.
[00:27:47.815 --> 00:27:54.878]  The look in the eyes of those people, to see those kids, to understand those parents, you understand the heartache.
[00:27:54.878 --> 00:27:59.641]  I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this.
[00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:05.844]  Um... I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this.
[00:28:05.844 --> 00:28:11.027]  Um... It is very hard... He wrote essays talking about murdering children.
[00:28:11.027 --> 00:28:11.127]  Oh...
[00:28:11.994 --> 00:28:18.359]  And Beethoven, God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy.
[00:28:18.359 --> 00:28:22.622]  I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this.
[00:28:22.622 --> 00:28:28.687]  There's a reason you're scared of men that look like that, you know.
[00:28:28.687 --> 00:28:30.949]  But I'll tell you about this.
[00:28:37.435 --> 00:28:38.695]  They don't want anybody to see this.
[00:28:38.695 --> 00:28:40.516]  They don't want you to raise the alarm.
[00:28:40.516 --> 00:28:42.657]  They don't want you to stop them.
[00:28:42.657 --> 00:28:44.138]  But we're here together.
[00:28:44.138 --> 00:28:45.438]  Share the link.
[00:28:45.438 --> 00:28:46.819]  Ban.video, the live feed.
[00:28:46.819 --> 00:28:47.999]  Ban.video.

[00:28:52.221 --> 00:28:52.841]  Call your neighbors.
[00:28:52.841 --> 00:28:53.601]  Get aggressive.
[00:28:53.601 --> 00:28:54.622]  We can overpower them.
[00:28:54.622 --> 00:28:55.622]  We can overpower their censorship.
[00:28:58.294 --> 00:29:03.376]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[00:29:59.284 --> 00:30:05.047]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[00:30:05.047 --> 00:30:09.769]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:12.450]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it.
[00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:14.611]  In the last two years, it's been a bestseller.
[00:30:14.611 --> 00:30:26.176]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[00:30:26.636 --> 00:30:36.280]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil, and so much more.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:41.523]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[00:30:41.803 --> 00:30:45.985]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[00:30:45.985 --> 00:30:49.707]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:30:52.729 --> 00:30:57.011]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[00:30:58.925 --> 00:31:06.353]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you, the products that InfoWarsLife.com are.
[00:31:06.353 --> 00:31:19.649]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:26.792]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[00:31:26.792 --> 00:31:28.552]  It sells itself.
[00:31:28.552 --> 00:31:36.596]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[00:31:37.476 --> 00:31:39.177]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[00:31:39.177 --> 00:31:51.546]  Well, BODY'S Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[00:31:51.546 --> 00:31:54.508]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.

[00:33:01.273 --> 00:33:03.915]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:09.451 --> 00:33:10.031]  Hell yes!
[00:33:10.031 --> 00:33:11.432]  We're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[00:33:11.432 --> 00:33:18.756]  We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.
[00:33:18.756 --> 00:33:20.717]  You know, Australia's a good example.
[00:33:20.717 --> 00:33:22.558]  Canada's a good example.
[00:33:22.558 --> 00:33:24.319]  The UK is a good example.
[00:33:24.319 --> 00:33:25.780]  Why?
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.121]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[00:33:28.121 --> 00:33:30.703]  Somebody, somewhere will comment and say,
[00:33:31.716 --> 00:33:34.118]  Obama politicized this issue.
[00:33:34.118 --> 00:33:37.320]  Well, this is something we should politicize.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.361]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[00:33:38.361 --> 00:33:40.102]  I don't want to be involved in a gun fight.
[00:33:40.102 --> 00:33:52.671]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:33:58.148 --> 00:33:59.729]  Go ahead.
[00:33:59.729 --> 00:34:01.249]  Make my day.
[00:34:01.249 --> 00:34:05.591]  So the notion that gun laws don't work is not borne out by the evidence.
[00:34:05.591 --> 00:34:11.414]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[00:34:11.414 --> 00:34:20.238]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[00:34:20.238 --> 00:34:20.718]  We'll make it.
[00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:25.273]  Harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns.
[00:34:25.273 --> 00:34:32.801]  In many cases the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[00:34:32.801 --> 00:34:39.929]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.
[00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:43.392]  There are people at high levels in this government who have
[00:34:44.434 --> 00:34:46.117]  Bodyguards.
[00:34:46.117 --> 00:34:48.401]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:34:48.401 --> 00:34:50.785]  The average American does not have that.
[00:34:50.785 --> 00:34:54.632]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not...
[00:34:55.512 --> 00:34:56.633]  The majority of Americans.
[00:34:56.633 --> 00:34:59.135]  I mean, look at the team of security you got!
[00:34:59.135 --> 00:35:01.977]  Every day, every school, at every level.
[00:35:01.977 --> 00:35:07.781]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:35:07.781 --> 00:35:14.746]  And we need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:19.069]  Was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist?
[00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:27.056]  When a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles, the school called it a terrorist threat.
[00:35:27.056 --> 00:35:31.079]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:35:31.079 --> 00:35:35.523]  You know, the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny.
[00:35:35.523 --> 00:35:37.544]  Lay down your arms, you damned rebels!
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:43.428]  But we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police.
[00:35:43.428 --> 00:35:45.230]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:46.291]  would you see that happening?
[00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:51.396]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:35:51.396 --> 00:35:55.080]  The clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:04.685]  To say we're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not knocking down, if you want to come and take us!
[00:36:04.685 --> 00:36:09.227]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:36:09.227 --> 00:36:11.188]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:36:25.103 --> 00:36:27.944]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:36:27.944 --> 00:36:29.064]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:36:29.064 --> 00:36:30.805]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us.
[00:36:30.805 --> 00:36:37.367]  When I start the next hour, I'm going to get into how to stop this move to disarm the American people and complete our journey into slavery.
[00:36:37.367 --> 00:36:45.690]  And I'm going to get into the globalist larger plan to carry that out and what will happen if they're partially successful triggering a civil war.
[00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.711]  There's a way to stop all this right now.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:37:04.051]  And that's to go on a counter-offensive and to expose the medications that admit they caused mass murder and the media with the studies that admit they are spurring people who are mentally ill to commit these acts that are still very rare but are up.
[00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:05.872]  Overall crime hit its height in 1991.
[00:37:08.223 --> 00:37:11.066]  It went down 61% violent crime with guns.
[00:37:11.066 --> 00:37:12.788]  Overall, that's FBI numbers.
[00:37:12.788 --> 00:37:15.932]  And then now, crime's gone back up about 10% of that.
[00:37:15.932 --> 00:37:17.393]  It has gone away.
[00:37:17.393 --> 00:37:22.379]  So we're only at about 50% reduction, according to Professor Lott, of what we were.
[00:37:22.379 --> 00:37:24.902]  Of what we were.
[00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:30.373]  Previous to 1991.
[00:37:30.373 --> 00:37:32.134]  But in the 80s, that was the big crime wave.
[00:37:32.134 --> 00:37:32.895]  Everybody knows that.
[00:37:32.895 --> 00:37:35.277]  And people went out and got guns to protect themselves.
[00:37:35.277 --> 00:37:37.058]  So the left really wants to sew this up.
[00:37:37.058 --> 00:37:38.860]  They want political power over everyone.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.181]  It's a very critical time.
[00:37:40.181 --> 00:37:46.126]  But I wanted to get Paul Joseph Watson on about a particular article he wrote for Summit.News and Infowars.com.
[00:37:46.126 --> 00:37:48.708]  We have a video clip we're going to get to as well next segment.
[00:37:49.288 --> 00:37:55.731]  And that is millennials being taught to have nothing and be poor and live in coffin-sized apartments.
[00:37:55.731 --> 00:38:01.274]  And this has gone from being promoted just a few years ago by Bloomberg and others to now being mainline.
[00:38:01.274 --> 00:38:03.495]  But per square foot, it's a total ripoff.
[00:38:03.495 --> 00:38:06.676]  They charge you 10, 15 times what you would have gotten previously.
[00:38:06.676 --> 00:38:08.357]  So they're teaching you to have less.
[00:38:08.357 --> 00:38:09.918]  They're teaching you have no free speech.
[00:38:09.918 --> 00:38:11.199]  You have no privacy.
[00:38:11.199 --> 00:38:13.019]  You're always being surveilled.
[00:38:13.019 --> 00:38:17.201]  So let's go ahead and go to Paul Joseph Watson from London, England to give us his breakdown on this.
[00:38:17.201 --> 00:38:17.982]  Paul, thanks for joining us.
[00:38:19.454 --> 00:38:20.014]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:38:20.014 --> 00:38:23.476]  Yeah, this was a feature put out by CNN.
[00:38:23.476 --> 00:38:27.277]  Very glowing review of this Podshare company.
[00:38:27.277 --> 00:38:34.060]  Basically, if people watch the clip, and I've just put up a video about it on YouTube, it's on Infowars.com.
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.761]  There's a quote from Hilaire Belloc, who is a writer and historian.
[00:38:36.761 --> 00:38:42.784]  He said, quote, if we do not restore the institution of property, we cannot escape restoring the institution of slavery.
[00:38:42.784 --> 00:38:45.165]  There is no third choice.
[00:38:45.165 --> 00:38:47.646]  Ownership and property, Alex, is freedom.
[00:38:47.646 --> 00:38:48.466]  But the fact is that
[00:38:49.324 --> 00:38:56.029]  Millennials in the West cannot afford to buy homes anymore because their paychecks have remained stagnant.
[00:38:56.029 --> 00:39:01.273]  Meanwhile, with quantitative easing, vast money printing, inflation's gone through the roof.
[00:39:01.273 --> 00:39:10.139]  To the point now in the UK where people are renting out literal cupboards under the stairs with a single bed in it for the equivalent of $750 a month.
[00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:13.242]  Okay, when I first bought a house back in 2003 when I was about 21,
[00:39:18.197 --> 00:39:21.038]  I was paying $200 a month mortgage.
[00:39:21.038 --> 00:39:25.619]  Now you can't even rent a cupboard under the stairs for less than $750.
[00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:30.961]  And it's because, Alex, that obviously wages have remained stagnant.
[00:39:30.961 --> 00:39:35.262]  In the US, home ownership is at its lowest in half a century.
[00:39:35.262 --> 00:39:43.725]  And it's mainly being driven by these broke millennials who are shelling out $1,200 a month in this case to live in the middle of San Francisco.
[00:39:44.631 --> 00:39:54.489]  This S-hole city with needles all over the floor, junkies everywhere, huge homelessness problem, you know, poop on the streets every ten paces.
[00:39:55.149 --> 00:39:56.451]  And they've got no privacy.
[00:39:56.451 --> 00:40:00.295]  They're living in literal prison-style bunk beds.
[00:40:00.295 --> 00:40:05.421]  As you said, this is designed to atomize people, to prevent them from having families.
[00:40:05.421 --> 00:40:15.333]  How on earth are you going to form any romantic relationship with anyone if you're literally cheek-by-jowl with five other people in prison-style bunk beds?
[00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:19.175]  And this is admitted that this is being put in as a post-human world.
[00:40:19.175 --> 00:40:21.115]  This was written all about the 60s.
[00:40:21.115 --> 00:40:22.256]  It was in the official plans.
[00:40:22.256 --> 00:40:30.979]  It's what China did in the Great Leap Forward Cultural Revolution that killed 115 million people, is they took the 90% rural population and forced them into this.
[00:40:30.979 --> 00:40:37.442]  So this, that's why David Rockefeller in 73 wrote an op-ed when Mao Zedong died, praising it as the model for the world.
[00:40:39.252 --> 00:40:46.678]  Yeah, it was actually part of the agenda of why they built all these giant tower blocks, specifically in Western Europe.
[00:40:46.678 --> 00:40:48.439]  Of course, they're everywhere in London.
[00:40:48.439 --> 00:40:50.520]  They've started to demolish some of them.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:41:00.568]  But it was from the start designed by Corbusier, the French architect, to be this totalitarian idea of having all the worker bees stacked on top of each other
[00:41:01.008 --> 00:41:07.590]  Close together in the city, get them out of the rural areas, get them into the city where they can be easily controlled.
[00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:12.771]  This is the UN Sustainable Agenda 21 mission to do that.
[00:41:12.771 --> 00:41:29.655]  And it's coincided with a situation in cities like San Francisco where the middle class are fleeing because they can no longer afford a decent standard of living, but the illegals are still flooding in because just like in London, the illegals and even some of the legal immigrants
[00:41:30.035 --> 00:41:36.758]  We'll live 10 to a tiny apartment in London because their benchmark for standard of living is so low.
[00:41:36.758 --> 00:41:45.043]  So they'll earn enough money between them to live 10 to a tiny apartment and actually have disposable income to send back home to Romania or wherever they come from.
[00:41:45.043 --> 00:41:49.625]  Of course, the middle class are not happy with having that standard of living.
[00:41:49.625 --> 00:41:50.886]  So they're having to flee.
[00:41:50.886 --> 00:41:52.666]  They're having to go to other areas.
[00:41:52.666 --> 00:41:55.488]  And of course, out of California, a lot of them are going to Austin.
[00:41:56.554 --> 00:42:04.635]  And are turning Texas blue, basically, so it has a political knock-on effect as well.
[00:42:04.635 --> 00:42:07.916]  Paul, this is a concerted global model.
[00:42:07.916 --> 00:42:11.537]  And it's being done to make us a post-industrial world, to make life miserable.
[00:42:11.537 --> 00:42:23.679]  You've done your modern art pieces where you show mainline articles where the CIA, run by Lepus Foundations, in the 50s and 60s said, we want ugly art, we want ugly homes, we want ugly government buildings, we want to oppress you, we want you to give up.
[00:42:24.179 --> 00:42:28.002]  And then now they're saying we want to kill babies after they're born and we, you know, we do.
[00:42:28.002 --> 00:42:28.702]  They are babies.
[00:42:28.702 --> 00:42:30.043]  We love killing them.
[00:42:30.043 --> 00:42:35.648]  I mean, this is a real, true, venomous, evil attack by Hollywood and all of it.
[00:42:35.648 --> 00:42:41.412]  I want to talk about this more and where you think it's all going on the other side and why you think they're coming out of the open now.
[00:42:41.812 --> 00:42:45.977]  From what was behind the scenes to externalizing the method with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:42:45.977 --> 00:42:47.319]  Has an excellent site, you should check it out.
[00:42:47.319 --> 00:42:48.300]  Summit.News.
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:55.329]  Of course he still works, does a great job with InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, but Summit.News has not been as blacklisted as InfoWars, so share those links.
[00:42:57.631 --> 00:43:01.873]  We sold Secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third best seller.
[00:43:01.873 --> 00:43:06.636]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[00:43:06.636 --> 00:43:08.877]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[00:43:08.877 --> 00:43:13.279]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[00:43:13.279 --> 00:43:18.362]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:20.203]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[00:43:20.203 --> 00:43:21.484]  Helps make DNA.
[00:43:21.484 --> 00:43:22.825]  Helps the body produce energy.
[00:43:22.825 --> 00:43:24.305]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[00:43:24.305 --> 00:43:26.327]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[00:43:26.327 --> 00:43:27.087]  It goes on and on.
[00:43:27.287 --> 00:43:35.394]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[00:43:35.394 --> 00:43:37.936]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[00:43:37.936 --> 00:43:44.782]  It helps fund the InfoWar, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:43:44.782 --> 00:43:50.106]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[00:43:50.106 --> 00:43:55.371]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now on InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:43:58.228 --> 00:44:03.972]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[00:44:03.972 --> 00:44:08.716]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over-the-counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[00:44:08.716 --> 00:44:12.178]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[00:44:12.178 --> 00:44:12.859]  It's been a bestseller.
[00:44:13.539 --> 00:44:25.586]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented silver salt technology in it.
[00:44:25.586 --> 00:44:35.231]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[00:44:35.231 --> 00:44:40.474]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[00:44:40.734 --> 00:44:44.919]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[00:44:44.919 --> 00:44:48.644]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:44:48.644 --> 00:44:51.667]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[00:44:51.667 --> 00:44:55.952]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[00:44:59.028 --> 00:45:06.456]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you, the products at Infowarslife.com are on offer.
[00:45:06.456 --> 00:45:19.731]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:26.900]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.663]  It sells itself.
[00:45:28.663 --> 00:45:36.714]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[00:45:37.575 --> 00:45:39.297]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[00:45:39.297 --> 00:45:51.646]  Well, BODY'S Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, and it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[00:45:51.646 --> 00:45:54.609]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[00:45:54.609 --> 00:45:56.830]  50% off on BODY'S at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:45:58.627 --> 00:46:07.172]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[00:46:07.172 --> 00:46:11.835]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[00:46:11.835 --> 00:46:18.719]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[00:46:19.199 --> 00:46:28.924]  I was the first to warn you, along with Paul Watson at Infowars.com, 15 years ago, that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do.
[00:46:28.924 --> 00:46:42.710]  And hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy, that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese, on every one of these issues.
[00:46:45.452 --> 00:46:47.114]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:13.687 --> 00:47:15.430]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:25.606]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:42.031 --> 00:47:42.751]  We are back live.
[00:47:42.751 --> 00:47:45.392]  Paul Joseph Watson riding shotgun with us.
[00:47:45.392 --> 00:47:48.093]  Great rider researcher.
[00:47:48.093 --> 00:47:52.214]  At Prison Planet still on Twitter and of course doing a great job at Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:47:52.214 --> 00:47:59.376]  We're gonna go back to Paul to finish up with the plan to vertically integrate the economy with big tech to make any other type of economy impossible.
[00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:04.018]  Show that once you are reliant on the system and once humans have been made...
[00:48:04.952 --> 00:48:12.358]  Redundant, they can then dictate the terms of our surrender for sterilization and then euthanization.
[00:48:12.358 --> 00:48:17.462]  And that is the globalist mop-up plan, the post-industrial world.
[00:48:17.462 --> 00:48:19.023]  It is extremely serious.
[00:48:19.023 --> 00:48:23.227]  But they know that the West and the Renaissance and the Christian ethos could pump up
[00:48:24.261 --> 00:48:24.581]  I think so.
[00:48:52.383 --> 00:48:58.466]  Those are, of course, you can get the Brain Force Plus, great nootropic that people absolutely love.
[00:48:58.466 --> 00:49:02.327]  Good, clean, focused energy with a free bottle of Chill Force.
[00:49:02.327 --> 00:49:11.972]  It helps people kind of have that zen focus if you take it with the Turbo Force or when you've been on a lot of Turbo Force or Brain Force Plus and are coming down from that.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:23.042]  TurboForce is 10-hour clean energy with a bunch of minerals and vitamins and cofactors and is the best from our research.
[00:49:23.042 --> 00:49:30.644]  Pre-workout, post-workout, long-haul truck driving, military, law enforcement, college professors, teachers.
[00:49:30.644 --> 00:49:33.045]  I mean, if you want long sustained 10-hour energy.

[00:50:40.844 --> 00:50:43.425]  It's filled to the brim, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:50:58.595 --> 00:51:00.697]  Your wife, your girlfriend will, once you get it for them.

[00:51:03.779 --> 00:51:04.780]  So thank you all.
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.582]  Going back to Paul Joseph Watson now.
[00:51:07.582 --> 00:51:08.663]  Finishing up on this.
[00:51:09.403 --> 00:51:11.344]  Post-human world, they admit they're building them.
[00:51:11.344 --> 00:51:12.986]  They really come out in the open about it.
[00:51:12.986 --> 00:51:14.567]  Talk about some more facets of it.
[00:51:14.567 --> 00:51:17.949]  And then you wanted to bring up this show called AI Brain.
[00:51:17.949 --> 00:51:25.374]  If you think you're already depressed and distracted with your smartphone and your so-called smart TV that's watching you, well, wait till you have this digital brain plugged in.
[00:51:25.374 --> 00:51:25.895]  Tell us about it.
[00:51:27.762 --> 00:51:38.565]  Yeah, I mean, it all ties into this idea that the elite wants the underclass that doesn't get the cybernetic upgrade, which they do, which literally turns them into a subspecies if they don't get it.
[00:51:38.565 --> 00:51:40.145]  I'll get onto that in a second.
[00:51:40.145 --> 00:51:44.686]  Finishing up on the pod people, basically no one owns anything.
[00:51:44.686 --> 00:51:48.787]  Ownership is freedom, but these millennials can't afford to own their own homes anymore.
[00:51:48.787 --> 00:51:53.428]  You know, they come out of college $30,000 in student debt.
[00:51:53.428 --> 00:51:55.509]  Country's in $22 trillion in debt.
[00:51:55.509 --> 00:51:56.289]  Everyone's in debt.
[00:51:56.289 --> 00:51:57.249]  Nobody can afford anything.
[00:51:57.927 --> 00:52:02.411]  And the other factor, Alex, is homelessness, because they've got this pod share in Los Angeles.
[00:52:02.411 --> 00:52:06.475]  There's been a 75% increase in homelessness in Los Angeles since 2012.
[00:52:06.475 --> 00:52:08.517]  There's trash everywhere.
[00:52:08.517 --> 00:52:12.060]  They're talking about the return of bubonic plague.
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:15.323]  60,000 homeless people on the streets of Los Angeles.
[00:52:15.323 --> 00:52:17.205]  75% of them don't have access to shelters.
[00:52:17.205 --> 00:52:18.406]  And yet, what are they doing?
[00:52:19.204 --> 00:52:19.844]  We're good to go.
[00:52:36.198 --> 00:52:47.409]  What we've talked about before, which is the elite wanting to maintain their own hedonistic lifestyle of decadence by maintaining that steady import of mass immigration, which also drives up house prices.
[00:52:47.409 --> 00:52:53.034]  You've got onerous property regulations, building regulations in California that drives up house prices.
[00:52:53.034 --> 00:52:55.977]  But the other factor that came out last week, which relates to this,
[00:52:56.778 --> 00:53:08.628]  Is so-called servant class jobs, jobs which cater to the needs of the elite, mass use, pedicure, stuff like that, massively outstrip normal job growth.
[00:53:08.628 --> 00:53:11.570]  So between 2008-2018, there was a 7% growth in general jobs, but a 114% increase in servant class jobs.
[00:53:19.597 --> 00:53:22.919]  So the illegals, the immigrants, are all coming into these megacities.
[00:53:22.919 --> 00:53:28.122]  The Silicon Valley elite are using them for their, you know, pedicures and manicures.
[00:53:28.122 --> 00:53:30.023]  Meanwhile, they're all living tent to an apartment.
[00:53:30.023 --> 00:53:32.805]  The middle class can't afford to move there, so they all move out.
[00:53:32.805 --> 00:53:43.491]  So you have this dystopian, two-cast system where you've got this underclass who are just wage slaves for the elite, and then the elite themselves with barely any middle class left.
[00:53:43.491 --> 00:53:47.774]  And that, obviously, Alex, fundamentally destabilizes society if you have no middle class.
[00:53:48.234 --> 00:53:50.737]  Globalism, the deals with China.
[00:53:50.737 --> 00:53:54.261]  We were going to be a service economy, good and clean for the earth.
[00:53:54.261 --> 00:53:57.545]  And now we're not even going to have fossil fuels, Joe Biden, the Democrats say.
[00:53:57.545 --> 00:54:02.290]  But China and India and Mexico and 160 plus other countries, they can all have no environmental standards.
[00:54:03.151 --> 00:54:08.192]  First they show little pods out in the countryside and, you know, mini-living and, you know, getting away from the big house.
[00:54:08.192 --> 00:54:09.233]  Well, that's totally true.
[00:54:09.233 --> 00:54:11.153]  That's healthy to be out in the woods.
[00:54:11.153 --> 00:54:18.895]  Then they cut in the piece to these new high-rises owned by Bloomberg and others where they, again, charge you 10 times per square foot what you would.
[00:54:18.895 --> 00:54:19.936]  It's literally a prison.
[00:54:20.896 --> 00:54:32.639]  Communal bunk bed, one toilet, and you pay what you would have just a few years ago for a decent apartment, all as a mind scam, telling the trendy leftists this is cool to be slaves.
[00:54:32.639 --> 00:54:38.420]  So they've been maneuvered, scammed by the colleges, worthless degrees, 90% of them, now maneuvered into this.
[00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.601]  And again, it's not just our opinion, it's all a master plan.
[00:54:41.601 --> 00:54:49.163]  I made Endgame 12 years ago, and I say you'll be in giant high-rises and tiny coffin apartments that are 250 square feet.
[00:54:50.063 --> 00:54:51.525]  Well, now they're not even giving you that.
[00:54:51.525 --> 00:54:52.285]  You don't even have that.
[00:54:52.285 --> 00:54:54.447]  You just have a bunk bed.
[00:54:54.447 --> 00:54:57.270]  Ladies and gentlemen, this has all been planned.
[00:54:57.270 --> 00:55:02.055]  And again, they're teaching you to have absolutely no freedom, no privacy beyond 1984.
[00:55:02.055 --> 00:55:08.141]  This is worse than how Winston Smith was living in George Orwell's vision of a Stalinist hell.
[00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:12.773]  At least Winston Smith had his own room, right?
[00:55:12.773 --> 00:55:14.555]  I don't even get that.
[00:55:14.555 --> 00:55:19.500]  There's a Black Mirror episode, which is like a sci-fi dystopian Netflix series.
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:20.141]  You've probably heard of it.
[00:55:20.777 --> 00:55:22.879]  Where again, all these people live in these pods.
[00:55:22.879 --> 00:55:23.999]  They're all atomized.
[00:55:23.999 --> 00:55:25.640]  None of them have families.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:27.241]  None of them have pets.
[00:55:27.241 --> 00:55:31.564]  They all go out and ride exercise bikes to power their own little society.
[00:55:31.564 --> 00:55:33.065]  It's like an ant colony.
[00:55:33.065 --> 00:55:35.327]  And that's exactly what they're creating.
[00:55:35.327 --> 00:55:41.011]  There was a debate in the Twitter thread about, oh, this is socialism, and other people saying, no, it's capitalism.
[00:55:41.611 --> 00:55:46.854]  Basically, the worst aspects of both, Alex, is hyper-capitalism.
[00:55:46.854 --> 00:55:48.875]  It's basically socialism for the rich.
[00:55:48.875 --> 00:55:52.376]  This is all anyone else can afford, unless you're in the elite.
[00:55:52.376 --> 00:55:57.859]  Because, as I said before, especially after the financial crash, they just kept on printing money.
[00:55:57.859 --> 00:56:01.201]  House prices rapidly inflated, but wages didn't.
[00:56:02.121 --> 00:56:02.802]  Let's go further.
[00:56:02.802 --> 00:56:04.342]  They also said they want to teach you.
[00:56:04.342 --> 00:56:08.405]  If you go to Whole Foods, it's all full of how to live poor, how sexy, how beautiful it is.
[00:56:08.405 --> 00:56:13.247]  They're teaching you to pay more for less in a post-industrial world because they don't want us uppity.
[00:56:13.247 --> 00:56:22.092]  They want us to be used to being poor as a way to control us, while the very people lecturing us fly around in jumbo jets and have yachts the size of aircraft carriers.
[00:56:23.746 --> 00:56:24.467]  Exactly.
[00:56:24.467 --> 00:56:28.170]  They just want the millennials, the hipsters, to just be able to scrape by.
[00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:35.697]  And again, they have no savings, so no incentives to start families, so we need to import more immigrants.
[00:56:35.697 --> 00:56:43.844]  And their only way they ever think they get ahead is if Bernie Sanders or Kamala Harris or Andrew Yang give them something free, which of course they'll never get.
[00:56:45.256 --> 00:56:50.659]  Yeah, and then you have the culture telling them that having babies is bad and evil, but not for people in Africa.
[00:56:50.659 --> 00:56:52.800]  They can still have nine kids, that's fine.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.381]  People have no savings, no ownership.
[00:56:54.381 --> 00:56:57.883]  Look at the stats out of the UK.
[00:56:57.883 --> 00:57:04.407]  In 1995, home ownership for young adults on middle income was 65% in 1995.
[00:57:04.407 --> 00:57:07.069]  Now it's 27%.
[00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:10.571]  See how far that's fallen for young adults on middle incomes.
[00:57:10.571 --> 00:57:12.392]  Again, mean house prices were 152% higher
[00:57:15.033 --> 00:57:20.980]  In 2016, 1995, after adjusting for inflation, they've inflated the bubble.
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:22.101]  Nobody has any money.
[00:57:22.101 --> 00:57:23.223]  Nobody has any savings.
[00:57:23.223 --> 00:57:24.304]  Nobody has any family.
[00:57:24.304 --> 00:57:28.709]  Everyone's atomized in these pods, living worthless, unhappy lives.
[00:57:28.709 --> 00:57:29.350]  That's what they want.
[00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:31.971]  Wow, Paul Watson telling it like it is.
[00:57:31.971 --> 00:57:33.532]  We want to explain something.
[00:57:33.532 --> 00:57:35.333]  It's worse than we're telling you, okay?
[00:57:35.333 --> 00:57:36.994]  It would take 10 hours to tell you all this.
[00:57:36.994 --> 00:57:39.696]  This is all we do is study this, okay?
[00:57:39.696 --> 00:57:45.319]  These people are building a hell for all of us, and I am not submitting to it!
[00:57:45.319 --> 00:57:46.660]  Never!
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.281]  Never!
[00:57:48.281 --> 00:57:55.665]  As I sit here recording this on the eve of September 11th, 2019, and I look back to that tragic event 18 years ago,
[00:57:57.779 --> 00:58:11.782]  It makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and have the Fire Department of New York and major construction and engineering firms come out and confirm that bombs were in Tower 1, Tower 2, and of course Building 7.
[00:58:11.782 --> 00:58:13.962]  It's just pancakes.
[00:58:13.962 --> 00:58:21.624]  And that then FBI Director Robert Mueller helped cover the whole thing up with the Saudis and to know that there's a deep state group
[00:58:22.384 --> 00:58:34.173]  Working within our government with radical Islam who are using the threat of Islamic terror to take our basic liberties and freedoms while empowering and funding radical Islam to take over the planet.
[00:58:34.173 --> 00:58:43.800]  Well, 18 years later, I'm here to tell you that the world is awake at 9-11 and InfoWars and our researchers and our guests, our whistleblowers, have been vindicated yet again.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.001]  That's why InfoWars.com is more important than ever.

[00:59:51.821 --> 00:59:54.483]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:17.330]  Welcome back.
[01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:17.970]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:21.814]  Paul Watson's our guest here.
[01:00:21.814 --> 01:00:24.017]  Paul, I've got an article right here.
[01:00:24.017 --> 01:00:25.018]  More studies out.
[01:00:25.018 --> 01:00:27.080]  Teens spend three hours a day on social media.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.342]  Makes them depressed.
[01:00:28.342 --> 01:00:29.303]  Makes adults depressed.
[01:00:29.303 --> 01:00:29.983]  Another article though.
[01:00:29.983 --> 01:00:31.365]  Don't worry.
[01:00:31.365 --> 01:00:32.006]  They've got a new
[01:00:33.237 --> 01:00:43.581]  A computer that'll hook your brain to things, so you can look at hundreds of things at one time, as if our attention spans aren't already short enough, as if our brains aren't fractured enough.
[01:00:43.581 --> 01:00:47.422]  All the studies show this is like a weapons system.
[01:00:47.422 --> 01:00:50.123]  Tell us about this new development.
[01:00:50.123 --> 01:00:54.665]  Yeah, there's a headline on Drudge, AI synthetic brains will allow humans to be in 500 places at once.
[01:00:56.337 --> 01:01:08.812]  This is the man behind Amazon's voice assistant, Igor Jabolikov, who believes artificial intelligence will become so advanced we will be unable to distinguish between a real or synthetic mind.
[01:01:08.812 --> 01:01:13.858]  Of course, the entire point, Alex, behind transhumanism, as Ray Kurzweil outlined in his
[01:01:14.931 --> 01:01:22.555]  1999 book, The Age of Special Machines, is that the underclass will not get access to this technology, at least not immediately.
[01:01:22.555 --> 01:01:30.380]  It will be very expensive, it will be the exclusive domain of the elite, and that's how they will further entrench this two-cast society.
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:43.187]  Kurzweil, in his own book, and I think I'm going to probably republish this article which was written way back in 2013, The Dark Side of Ray Kurzweil's Transhumanist Utopia, he wrote in his book, quote,
[01:01:44.011 --> 01:01:54.334]  Humans who do not utilize such implants, he's talking about cyborg implants, are unable to meaningfully participate in dialogues with those who do.
[01:01:54.334 --> 01:02:11.899]  So he's literally talking about humanity separating into two species, one the cybernetic version, one the underclass, two caste society, where those who don't have access to the technology, or those who refuse to have chips implanted in their brain basically, are going to be
[01:02:12.705 --> 01:02:16.769]  Castigated out of society, going to be ostracized out of society.
[01:02:16.769 --> 01:02:20.693]  And he also in fact quoted the Unibomber
[01:02:21.531 --> 01:02:24.934]  In his own book, he said, Ted Kaczynski said that, but Kurzweil quoted him in his own book
[01:02:43.303 --> 01:02:47.145]  So it was a semi-endorsement of the reality of that situation.
[01:02:47.145 --> 01:02:54.069]  Now you have McDonald's buying the technology where they don't even need a human taking your order at the drive-thru.
[01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:59.612]  The technology can differentiate between hundreds of different ways of saying things, different accents.
[01:02:59.612 --> 01:03:00.872]  So automation's coming in.
[01:03:00.872 --> 01:03:02.533]  There are going to be no jobs.
[01:03:02.533 --> 01:03:07.416]  Maybe Andrew Yang's $1,000 a month is going to keep people occupied for a while.
[01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.297]  But again, Alex, as you were talking about depression,
[01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:14.399]  If you don't have anything to do, if you don't have a purpose in life, that just generates more depression.
[01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:26.305]  So this life of a 15-hour work week, the carrot that they're dangling in front of us, is only going to create more misery, more depression, more deaths of despair, which are already skyrocketing in America.
[01:03:26.305 --> 01:03:27.065]  That's right.
[01:03:27.065 --> 01:03:33.288]  In the NBC article on screen, the first paragraph says that humans will be extinct.
[01:03:34.397 --> 01:03:40.239]  By the end of this generation, that the plan is we're all dead, and how wonderful it is that we'll vanish from the earth.
[01:03:40.239 --> 01:03:42.440]  This is their sick post-human world.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.581]  Are we gonna put up with this?
[01:03:44.581 --> 01:03:47.802]  That's what I'm saying, Paul.
[01:03:47.802 --> 01:04:01.146]  Precisely, it's whether the Refuseniks will, you know, whether the technology is so advanced that the elite will be so much more dominant with the brain processing power of that cybernetic augmentation, compared to the underclass who refuse to take it.
[01:04:01.146 --> 01:04:02.567]  But the elite have said many times,
[01:04:03.107 --> 01:04:11.552]  The eventual goal is to literally upload their brains into computers and live forever, and that's how they're going to dominate humanity forever.
[01:04:11.552 --> 01:04:16.315]  Meanwhile, us poor humans, flesh robots, just die and wither away.
[01:04:16.315 --> 01:04:18.096]  So they literally want to do that.
[01:04:18.096 --> 01:04:24.540]  They've planned it for decades, and now finally the early signs of the technology is starting to emerge to do that.
[01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:30.565]  It's going to be wireheads with stuff leaking out of their heads, wearing wigs, thinking they're part of the pool clubs.
[01:04:30.565 --> 01:04:38.152]  It's a grand falloon, and the truth is it's an enslavement system, and the whole thing is a giant fraud.
[01:04:38.152 --> 01:04:40.454]  These people are fools going down this road.
[01:04:40.454 --> 01:04:43.737]  They want to convince us that they control the future, so we just acquiesce to it.
[01:04:43.737 --> 01:04:44.958]  It's a giant con game.
[01:04:44.958 --> 01:04:46.880]  Paul Joseph Watson at Summit.News.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.341]  Great job.
[01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:48.962]  We'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[01:04:48.962 --> 01:04:50.343]  We're following all the amazing work.
[01:04:50.343 --> 01:04:50.624]  Thank you.
[01:04:51.598 --> 01:04:52.541]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:04:52.541 --> 01:04:53.644]  We'll be back!
[01:04:53.644 --> 01:04:54.225]  Stay with us.
[01:04:54.225 --> 01:04:55.709]  I'll tell you what's coming right after the break.
[01:04:57.176 --> 01:05:02.941]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[01:05:02.941 --> 01:05:07.664]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[01:05:07.664 --> 01:05:11.127]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[01:05:11.127 --> 01:05:12.508]  It's been a bestseller.
[01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:24.077]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[01:05:24.517 --> 01:05:34.167]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[01:05:34.167 --> 01:05:39.433]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[01:05:39.673 --> 01:05:47.597]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price, and it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:47.597 --> 01:05:50.619]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[01:05:50.619 --> 01:05:54.901]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[01:06:06.394 --> 01:06:07.915]  Lights out, slaves.
[01:06:07.915 --> 01:06:08.996]  Turn your energy off.
[01:06:08.996 --> 01:06:11.017]  Don't have children.
[01:06:11.017 --> 01:06:11.878]  Abort them.
[01:06:11.878 --> 01:06:13.379]  It's good for the Earth.
[01:06:13.379 --> 01:06:16.241]  Don't fly around on jet airplanes or have a fireplace.
[01:06:16.241 --> 01:06:17.482]  It's bad for the Earth.
[01:06:17.482 --> 01:06:20.244]  Oh, don't listen to Leonardo DiCaprio and Prince Harry.
[01:06:20.244 --> 01:06:21.084]  They're private jets.
[01:06:21.084 --> 01:06:21.725]  They're the elite.
[01:06:21.725 --> 01:06:22.946]  They're better than you.
[01:06:22.946 --> 01:06:25.027]  And now Beto O'Rourke says, hell yes!
[01:06:25.027 --> 01:06:30.291]  We're gonna take your guns away, and if you resist, we gonna kill your ass!
[01:06:30.291 --> 01:06:31.091]  In 2013, we put together
[01:06:33.444 --> 01:06:39.466]  This compilation of them coming for your guns, when they were denying it at the time, are just starting to admit some of it.
[01:06:39.466 --> 01:06:45.148]  And now here we are, where we were in 1775 when they came to Lexington Concord to take the guns.
[01:06:45.148 --> 01:06:53.990]  Then we'll talk to Caitlin Bennett, who was on the ground last night in Houston for the Democrats' most egregious display of their war on America.
[01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:55.091]  It just, it was unbelievable.
[01:06:55.091 --> 01:06:58.912]  We'll be talking to her in just a moment, but here is this report from the vault.
[01:07:10.019 --> 01:07:20.169]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:07:22.268 --> 01:07:26.011]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[01:07:26.011 --> 01:07:29.614]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[01:07:29.614 --> 01:07:31.815]  It's a military mission in North St.
[01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:32.456]  Louis.
[01:07:32.456 --> 01:07:39.681]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:44.484]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[01:07:44.484 --> 01:07:45.385]  Guns will be taken.
[01:07:45.385 --> 01:07:46.866]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:07:46.866 --> 01:07:47.707]  We will take all weapons.
[01:07:48.047 --> 01:07:50.429]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:07:50.429 --> 01:07:54.992]  Just really brainwashed people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:07:54.992 --> 01:07:55.852]  Enough.
[01:07:55.852 --> 01:07:56.653]  Enough.
[01:07:56.653 --> 01:07:57.714]  Enough.
[01:07:57.714 --> 01:07:58.094]  Enough.
[01:07:58.094 --> 01:08:02.657]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:08:02.657 --> 01:08:06.600]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:08:08.721 --> 01:08:22.210]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:08:22.210 --> 01:08:25.813]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:08:25.813 --> 01:08:27.394]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:08:28.257 --> 01:08:34.541]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:08:34.541 --> 01:08:39.485]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[01:08:39.485 --> 01:08:44.148]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[01:08:51.906 --> 01:08:56.928]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[01:08:56.928 --> 01:08:58.588]  Are you in your apartment?
[01:08:58.588 --> 01:08:59.709]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[01:08:59.709 --> 01:09:00.929]  Go back inside right now!
[01:09:00.929 --> 01:09:01.949]  I am inside.
[01:09:01.949 --> 01:09:03.850]  I have two words for you.
[01:09:03.850 --> 01:09:05.671]  Predator groans.
[01:09:05.671 --> 01:09:06.671]  You will never see it coming.
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.581]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[01:09:13.581 --> 01:09:22.825]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:28.287]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[01:09:28.287 --> 01:09:33.349]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:35.410]  If you want them, come and take them!
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:38.885]  We are on the march.
[01:09:38.885 --> 01:09:41.691]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:09:41.691 --> 01:09:46.201]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:10:01.058 --> 01:10:06.781]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[01:10:06.781 --> 01:10:14.504]  This is the heart of 1776.
[01:10:14.504 --> 01:10:30.471]  And six and a half years later, the Democrats officially say they're going to pry them from our cold, dead hands, so we can live like they do in Southside Chicago, or in the worst areas of Baltimore, Maryland, or the worst areas of Washington, D.C., or the worst areas of Detroit.
[01:10:37.102 --> 01:10:40.746]  Massively higher in the 1980s.
[01:10:40.746 --> 01:10:42.608]  As of about six years ago, it was down 61%.
[01:10:42.608 --> 01:10:46.151]  FBI's numbers, pull them up.
[01:10:46.151 --> 01:10:47.393]  Now it's gone back up some now.
[01:10:47.393 --> 01:10:51.477]  A lot of home invasions, a lot of crime even in Texas.
[01:10:51.477 --> 01:10:53.219]  A lot of criminals getting their asses blown off.
[01:10:56.138 --> 01:10:58.880]  That's always in the back of the paper, doesn't even make the news.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:03.284]  But, when some crazy sees the news hyping up mass shootings, all the studies show it.
[01:11:03.284 --> 01:11:09.229]  Just type in, studies conclusively find media coverage of mass shootings causing new ones.
[01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:11.632]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:11:11.632 --> 01:11:14.834]  Caitlin Bennett's with us for a couple segments.
[01:11:14.834 --> 01:11:20.880]  And then we're going to get into a way to stop this, a way to defeat this.
[01:11:22.281 --> 01:11:27.785]  There is a way, but they're going to keep saying every time there's a mass shooting, it's an epidemic, which it's not.
[01:11:27.785 --> 01:11:30.947]  They're going to hype it, and they're going to just keep saying, we've got to do something, we've got to do something.
[01:11:30.947 --> 01:11:32.148]  And they believe they're going to get the guns.
[01:11:32.148 --> 01:11:37.251]  And what they're going to trigger is a civil war, which is actually what they want, because they can't wreck the country.
[01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:39.393]  They can't get the guns fair and square.
[01:11:39.393 --> 01:11:41.975]  So they need a giant collapse to get it.
[01:11:41.975 --> 01:11:44.236]  They need to list gun owners as terrorists.
[01:11:44.236 --> 01:11:47.298]  That's why you see on the news, all gun owners are terrorists.
[01:11:47.298 --> 01:11:49.660]  The NRA members are terrorists.
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.641]  White men are terrorists.
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.223]  It's not black people pushing that idea.
[01:11:53.223 --> 01:11:56.649]  It's white leftists trying to cause a race war.
[01:11:56.649 --> 01:11:59.593]  This is right out of the Weatherman plan.
[01:11:59.593 --> 01:12:02.158]  It's right out of Solowinski.
[01:12:02.158 --> 01:12:02.999]  It's here.
[01:12:02.999 --> 01:12:05.082]  And so I want to get into the debates last night with Caitlyn.
[01:12:06.193 --> 01:12:11.137]  But first, you're the Penn State gun girl, three years ago, two years ago, become very famous since then.
[01:12:11.137 --> 01:12:14.559]  Do reporting from fullwars.com, your own great reporting as well.
[01:12:14.559 --> 01:12:16.581]  But I mean, they're really out in the open.
[01:12:16.581 --> 01:12:18.882]  Why do you think they're so naked about this now?
[01:12:18.882 --> 01:12:23.025]  And Jeh Johnson says he believes they're finally going to ban our guns.
[01:12:23.025 --> 01:12:25.147]  They want to do it now with executive orders, they say.
[01:12:25.147 --> 01:12:28.770]  If they can get rid of Trump, I mean, these people mean business.
[01:12:28.770 --> 01:12:30.471]  Why do you think they're being so honest now?
[01:12:31.857 --> 01:12:39.142]  I think they're being so honest because we have a lot of angry leftists in this country that are really mad about Trump.
[01:12:39.142 --> 01:12:45.387]  So they're going to come out and they're going to try to be like that radical kind of opposite of Trump here.
[01:12:45.387 --> 01:12:52.552]  So they think that since Trump got elected because he's so honest and he's blunt that now they're just going to be honest about it.
[01:12:52.552 --> 01:12:55.775]  And to be honest, the leftists want to ban guns.
[01:12:55.775 --> 01:13:00.138]  So if there's someone up there like Beto up there saying we're going to come and take
[01:13:00.778 --> 01:13:02.420]  I mean, there's no question about it.
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.221]  We're going to do it.
[01:13:03.221 --> 01:13:06.024]  And then he gets a giant applause.
[01:13:06.024 --> 01:13:07.865]  Of course, that's what they're going to say.
[01:13:07.865 --> 01:13:10.788]  And I just want to know how he's going to do it.
[01:13:10.788 --> 01:13:12.310]  Is he going to come take him themselves?
[01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:14.332]  Is he going to send the police?
[01:13:14.332 --> 01:13:15.153]  Who's going to take them?
[01:13:15.153 --> 01:13:19.457]  Because there's a lot here to take.
[01:13:19.457 --> 01:13:20.078]  There is.
[01:13:24.039 --> 01:13:28.562]  They've had National Review come out and say that drag queen story time is a wonderful thing.
[01:13:28.562 --> 01:13:33.525]  Convicted pedophiles in many cases, with children now humping them with erections.
[01:13:33.525 --> 01:13:35.647]  Men's genitals out with glitter on it.
[01:13:35.647 --> 01:13:36.807]  I can't even show this on TV.
[01:13:37.768 --> 01:13:41.191]  Okay, this is adult television with children.
[01:13:41.191 --> 01:13:43.153]  They're saying pedophilia is good now.
[01:13:43.153 --> 01:13:45.615]  They're killing babies after they're born.
[01:13:45.615 --> 01:13:47.737]  They say, we're here to corrupt your children and groom them.
[01:13:47.737 --> 01:13:55.304]  And then the mothers bring them two men dressed as clowns saying, groom my five-year-old.
[01:13:55.304 --> 01:13:57.826]  I mean, this is just, it's like hell opened up.
[01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:06.652]  Well, something else that I encountered at the debate last night was this older man.
[01:14:06.652 --> 01:14:16.254]  He said that they're going to change the definition of communism so that they can present it in a more better way than what history has taught us that communism does.
[01:14:16.254 --> 01:14:18.254]  Sridhar just told me his agenda.
[01:14:18.254 --> 01:14:26.296]  We're going to rewrite the history of what communism is, we're going to change the textbooks, we're going to change the definition, and then we're going to present it to people as if it was something
[01:14:26.736 --> 01:14:33.545]  That hasn't happened in the last, you know, however many years that they've tried to implement communism all around the world.
[01:14:33.545 --> 01:14:37.010]  So they have an agenda and they're being very honest about it.
[01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:44.560]  I think that's a good thing because they're being honest about it so we can combat it head on and we don't have to guess what they're trying to do.
[01:14:46.837 --> 01:14:47.377]  That's right.
[01:14:47.377 --> 01:14:51.178]  Instead of eating around the corners and being deceptive, that hasn't worked.
[01:14:51.178 --> 01:15:01.300]  And so they're just bum-rushing with everything they've got, thinking if they move the Overton window so far towards tyranny that it will battle and claw some of it back, but they'll still get some of what they want.
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.821]  So they're trying to externalize the hierarchy.
[01:15:03.821 --> 01:15:07.761]  They're trying to normalize it, whether it's pedophilia or killing babies after they're born.
[01:15:07.761 --> 01:15:10.122]  I mean, it even shocks me, just...
[01:15:10.862 --> 01:15:22.091]  Have you seen the compilation we put together of mainline TV saying, I love hurting little babies, I like to bully them, I like to kill my own children, those little pieces of filth, I love it, I'm so selfish, I enjoy it.
[01:15:22.091 --> 01:15:24.273]  And then they actually go and murder their babies.
[01:15:24.273 --> 01:15:26.695]  And the women, I can't even play these clips.
[01:15:26.695 --> 01:15:28.796]  And she goes, I love it, it feels so good.
[01:15:28.796 --> 01:15:31.839]  I mean, it's like, what the hell?
[01:15:31.839 --> 01:15:35.061]  And what it is, is we haven't stood up to these people, so they're just running wild.
[01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:41.173]  Well, they're right back with Kaitlin Bennett to get into what she saw on the ground at the debate last night.
[01:15:41.173 --> 01:15:43.234]  The other debates, there's almost been no one on the ground there.
[01:15:43.234 --> 01:15:49.778]  Were there any supporters for these drooling leftist ring race that she saw in Houston?
[01:15:49.778 --> 01:15:53.920]  Kaitlin Bennett, straight ahead on Alex Jones with Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.361]  And now, Band.video.
[01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:57.202]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:57.202 --> 01:15:58.502]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:15:58.502 --> 01:16:02.224]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:03.305]  Forget bonkers.
[01:16:03.305 --> 01:16:04.806]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:05.146 --> 01:16:06.848]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:25.461 --> 01:16:31.806]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:31.806 --> 01:16:34.849]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:34.849 --> 01:16:40.793]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:40.793 --> 01:16:44.576]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:44.576 --> 01:16:45.837]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:45.837 --> 01:16:46.838]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:46.838 --> 01:16:53.384]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:53.384 --> 01:16:54.825]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:55.785 --> 01:16:57.747]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:57.747 --> 01:17:03.071]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:03.071 --> 01:17:04.653]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:13.020]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:18.705]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:17:18.865 --> 01:17:20.686]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:17:20.686 --> 01:17:22.848]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:22.848 --> 01:17:27.351]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:29.552]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:17:29.552 --> 01:17:37.398]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:17:57.210 --> 01:18:05.754]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[01:18:05.754 --> 01:18:10.397]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[01:18:10.397 --> 01:18:17.300]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:27.488]  I was the first to warn you, along with Paul Watson and Infowars.com, 15 years ago that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do.
[01:18:27.488 --> 01:18:41.800]  And hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy, that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese, on every one of these issues and many others.
[01:18:44.206 --> 01:18:46.347]  Raise the alarm on a planetary scale.
[01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:48.447]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[01:18:48.447 --> 01:18:52.949]  And that's why you are more critical than ever to support the Infowar.
[01:18:52.949 --> 01:18:56.410]  Please support the Infowar however you can.
[01:18:56.410 --> 01:19:00.631]  We sold Secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third bestseller.
[01:19:00.631 --> 01:19:05.412]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[01:19:05.412 --> 01:19:07.653]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[01:19:07.653 --> 01:19:11.674]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there,
[01:19:12.034 --> 01:19:17.136]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[01:19:17.136 --> 01:19:18.956]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[01:19:18.956 --> 01:19:20.257]  Helps make DNA.
[01:19:20.257 --> 01:19:21.577]  Helps the body produce energy.
[01:19:21.577 --> 01:19:23.078]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[01:19:23.078 --> 01:19:25.079]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[01:19:25.079 --> 01:19:25.879]  It goes on and on.
[01:19:25.879 --> 01:19:34.182]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[01:19:34.182 --> 01:19:36.723]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[01:19:36.723 --> 01:19:37.823]  It helps fund the info war.
[01:19:38.123 --> 01:19:39.424]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:25.055]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.055 --> 01:20:29.718]  Yeah, I hate that total dork.
[01:20:29.718 --> 01:20:33.241]  By the way, articles on InfoWars.com.
[01:20:33.241 --> 01:20:35.102]  That total dork has come out.
[01:20:35.102 --> 01:20:37.423]  We'll cover it next segment.
[01:20:37.423 --> 01:20:42.707]  With a gun confiscation shirt that says, hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s.
[01:20:42.707 --> 01:20:44.328]  Well, we're going to sell a shirt.
[01:20:44.328 --> 01:20:45.289]  We'll get it by next week.
[01:20:45.289 --> 01:20:46.970]  We're going to put up, you know, they don't have these yet.
[01:20:49.178 --> 01:20:53.422]  He's been making money off the stuff that happened there in South Texas as well.
[01:20:53.422 --> 01:20:55.604]  He sold shirts about that.
[01:20:55.604 --> 01:21:00.728]  We're going to put a shirt out that basically says, from our cold, dead hands, Beto.
[01:21:00.728 --> 01:21:03.911]  Basically, come and get it, Beto O'Rourke.
[01:21:03.911 --> 01:21:05.892]  Come and get it, Beto O'Rourke.
[01:21:05.892 --> 01:21:09.195]  Because it's not going to be from our cold, dead hands.
[01:21:09.195 --> 01:21:11.517]  It's going to be from somebody else's.
[01:21:11.517 --> 01:21:14.019]  We'll come up with one by the end of the show.
[01:21:14.019 --> 01:21:14.580]  Speaking of that,
[01:21:15.728 --> 01:21:33.572]  We have a lot of t-shirts that are really high quality, that have the really soft, nice fabric, that cost us $10 to $13 a piece, that are sold at Dillard's and sold at Macy's and sold at places like Tyler's that's in Texas for $35.
[01:21:33.572 --> 01:21:36.452]  So you understand, like most people sell a $5 shirt for $19.95, they sell a $13 shirt for $35.40.
[01:21:42.611 --> 01:21:47.734]  These shirts, the Space Shuttle shirt, the Betsy Ross flag shirt has that really nice fabric.
[01:21:47.734 --> 01:21:53.157]  These are designer shirts for $19.95, but I'm making $7 on them.
[01:21:53.157 --> 01:21:54.778]  It's about promoting InfoWars.
[01:21:54.778 --> 01:21:55.999]  But get in there and buy them.
[01:21:55.999 --> 01:21:58.360]  Get the InfoWars Tank Man shirt.
[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:01.302]  It shows all the big tech is tanks, but it's trying to run over InfoWars.
[01:22:01.302 --> 01:22:02.562]  That's one of my favorites.
[01:22:02.562 --> 01:22:04.623]  There's so many there.
[01:22:04.623 --> 01:22:10.627]  Now, I haven't gotten into really what should have been our top story, but they're saying they're coming to confiscate the guns.
[01:22:11.994 --> 01:22:15.296]  is so huge that it had to be our top story.
[01:22:15.296 --> 01:22:20.098]  Then all the free stuff is big, but they are indicting Andrew McCabe.
[01:22:20.098 --> 01:22:22.920]  I want to explain stuff to folks.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:33.005]  We'll do it after Kaitlin leaves us, but this is so big that it actually makes me sort of have an anxiety attack.
[01:22:33.005 --> 01:22:35.767]  And I don't have those except like when my wife's having a baby or something.
[01:22:37.196 --> 01:22:38.917]  And the head stuck or something, you know?
[01:22:38.917 --> 01:22:41.359]  I mean, I got nerves, okay?
[01:22:41.359 --> 01:22:50.725]  I may get hyper and jump around, but I don't... The level of the climate politically is so powerful right now, it's so important.
[01:22:50.725 --> 01:22:55.768]  Good and evil are both moving at the same time that if you're not getting chills, you're not dialed in.
[01:22:55.768 --> 01:23:03.573]  Because I know we've been up here talking about the world being crazy for a long time, it has been, but everything is doubling in its intensity every month now.
[01:23:03.573 --> 01:23:05.254]  Whoa, I just got massive chills.
[01:23:05.254 --> 01:23:05.855]  Are you getting those?
[01:23:07.930 --> 01:23:09.255]  Let's try to go back to Caitlin Bennett.
[01:23:09.255 --> 01:23:12.466]  Her Skype's been breaking up some, but she's been following so many amazing reports.
[01:23:15.336 --> 01:23:17.878]  Caitlin Hill, if you're still in Texas, you ought to come up here and be in studio with us.
[01:23:17.878 --> 01:23:21.702]  I'm going to do a special live show tomorrow, 2 to 4 p.m.
[01:23:21.702 --> 01:23:22.582]  We may even go longer.
[01:23:22.582 --> 01:23:30.389]  It's going to be called the InfoWars Roundtable Show, where we'll have guest hosts and callers from the show that I think are our best callers.
[01:23:30.389 --> 01:23:31.550]  We'll be adding to the list.
[01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:35.513]  I'll be hosting segments with us.
[01:23:35.513 --> 01:23:37.855]  And I'm also going to obviously do the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:23:37.855 --> 01:23:39.277]  I'm just redoubling everything I'm doing.
[01:23:39.277 --> 01:23:42.820]  But talk about what you saw on the ground with the Democrats last night.
[01:23:44.443 --> 01:23:51.565]  So when we got there, we were expecting a really big presence, kind of like in Detroit, but it was so low energy.
[01:23:51.565 --> 01:23:53.005]  There was like no one there.
[01:23:53.005 --> 01:24:00.447]  It's almost as if campaign people for the candidates came out and handed out campaign signs for people to hold.
[01:24:00.447 --> 01:24:04.348]  The fewest number of supporters were for Tulsi.
[01:24:04.348 --> 01:24:08.889]  Of course, she wasn't up there, but the nicest people were the Tulsi supporters.
[01:24:09.749 --> 01:24:14.492]  There was a large crowd for Biden, a large crowd for Bernie.
[01:24:14.492 --> 01:24:16.674]  It was kind of all over the place.
[01:24:16.674 --> 01:24:18.395]  It wasn't organized very well.
[01:24:18.395 --> 01:24:26.179]  Like I said, each group was kind of in their own thing and there were maybe a dozen and a half of them for each supporter.
[01:24:26.179 --> 01:24:27.840]  It was really sad.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.341]  It was so sad.
[01:24:29.341 --> 01:24:35.925]  Elaborate on that.
[01:24:35.925 --> 01:24:36.106]  Yeah.
[01:24:37.432 --> 01:24:46.706]  When we got there, the Biden people were basically up front, and there were a dozen and a half of them there.
[01:24:46.706 --> 01:24:52.815]  And then we went over to try to talk to them, and a lot of them kind of recognized me at first, and I didn't want to speak.
[01:24:53.195 --> 01:24:56.559]  But they were mostly just chanting, so they would each have their own chant.
[01:24:56.559 --> 01:25:02.506]  So the Biden people have their own chant, the Tulsi people have their own chant, and then the Bernie people had their own chant.
[01:25:02.506 --> 01:25:11.797]  It was really hard to follow along what they were chanting about, what was their main issue, and then in came the climate people, and then in came these
[01:25:12.698 --> 01:25:20.288]  Mexican radical brown berets I think they're called and they were in California, Texas, Arizona, Mexico.
[01:25:20.288 --> 01:25:22.270]  They're hardcore communists.
[01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:25.394]  Basically, they're like Hispanic KKK members that are communists.
[01:25:27.225 --> 01:25:29.066]  And it was so crazy.
[01:25:29.066 --> 01:25:38.591]  So I got in there and I asked them if I could speak because I felt so inspired by their message of defunding ICE and all this stuff.
[01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:44.654]  And so I asked to speak and they were going to hand me the microphone until someone goes, no, don't hand it to her.
[01:25:44.654 --> 01:25:46.716]  Let a black woman speak instead.
[01:25:46.716 --> 01:25:51.598]  And I was like, imagine if it were the other way around.
[01:25:51.598 --> 01:25:53.839]  The whole world would be burning right now.
[01:25:53.839 --> 01:25:56.381]  So I think these people are a
[01:25:57.399 --> 01:26:00.061]  I was about to say, I can't wait to see this.
[01:26:00.061 --> 01:26:01.902]  I mean, the Brown Berets are just like the KKK.
[01:26:01.902 --> 01:26:03.723]  They're stupid, they're trashy, they always have one tooth.
[01:26:21.155 --> 01:26:24.203]  Because I've gone out and protested the KKK, and they show up too.
[01:26:24.203 --> 01:26:27.290]  They show up too, and it's just like, they hate white people.
[01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:30.518]  I mean, it's just unbelievable how crazy this is.
[01:26:31.718 --> 01:26:32.678]  I mean, they would.
[01:26:32.678 --> 01:26:40.981]  And then when I actually tried to interject at one point and they were talking about separating babies from their mothers at the border, I said, what about abortion?
[01:26:40.981 --> 01:26:45.542]  We're separating a million babies every year from their mother through abortion.
[01:26:45.542 --> 01:26:46.702]  And they say, shut up.
[01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:48.163]  A black woman's talking.
[01:26:48.163 --> 01:26:48.643]  Shut up.
[01:26:48.643 --> 01:26:52.864]  And then they look at the police and they're like, and there's the officer touching me without my consent.
[01:26:53.124 --> 01:26:56.708]  Also notice there's some Muslims in there with the coalition.
[01:26:56.708 --> 01:27:00.753]  You know, under Islam, they wouldn't even let those women out of the house to do anything political or drive a car.
[01:27:00.753 --> 01:27:02.535]  Oh, but in America, they're hanging out with the leftists.
[01:27:04.743 --> 01:27:05.804]  It was totally insane.
[01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:07.625]  There was so much that went on there.
[01:27:07.625 --> 01:27:20.552]  There was a small crowd, but I almost think smaller crowds are better because we're able to get in there and actually capture what individuals of these movements are thinking and the crazy things that they endorse.
[01:27:20.552 --> 01:27:30.397]  They were chanting, F the police, like they always do, and then they went and told the police to remove me from public property, which I stood my ground and I told the police I wasn't going to do because I know my rights.
[01:27:31.097 --> 01:27:33.358]  And we're going to have a whole video going on about that.
[01:27:33.358 --> 01:27:39.181]  Well, Caitlin, the minute you've got these videos, we're going to post them to NewsWars.com and Infowars.com.
[01:27:39.181 --> 01:27:40.521]  And please come on the War Room today.
[01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:44.963]  Please come on Firepower with Will Johnson, especially as soon as you get a cleaner Skype connection.
[01:27:44.963 --> 01:27:46.364]  You just do a superlative job.
[01:27:46.364 --> 01:27:47.284]  The team does.
[01:27:47.284 --> 01:27:48.185]  Your fiancé does.
[01:27:48.185 --> 01:27:49.545]  Your camera man does.
[01:27:49.545 --> 01:27:51.846]  And we love you guys, so please come to Austin as soon as you want.
[01:27:51.846 --> 01:27:53.967]  We'll fly you here and have you in studio.
[01:27:53.967 --> 01:27:55.328]  If you're still in Texas, please come now.
[01:27:57.589 --> 01:28:06.997]  Again, come on Firepower, Will Johnson and Tom Papert and I want you and others to start trying to do a daily show or weekly show too as well because you're doing such an amazing job.
[01:28:06.997 --> 01:28:09.439]  Where else can people find the whole consortium?
[01:28:09.439 --> 01:28:13.703]  I know you launched a website like Drudge has said everybody should do.
[01:28:13.703 --> 01:28:17.966]  You're still on Facebook, Twitter and places but more and more getting banned yourself.
[01:28:17.966 --> 01:28:19.968]  People need to go to your actual URL.
[01:28:19.968 --> 01:28:20.789]  Tell folks about that.
[01:28:22.981 --> 01:28:27.044]  Yes, so go to LibertyHangout.org, and that is our website.
[01:28:27.044 --> 01:28:30.787]  And then we post all of our videos on Liberty Hangout's YouTube channel.
[01:28:30.787 --> 01:28:32.729]  That's right, LibertyHangout.org.
[01:28:32.729 --> 01:28:34.590]  All right, thank you so much, Kaitlyn.
[01:28:34.590 --> 01:28:34.990]  Can't wait.
[01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:36.031]  How long do those videos are out?
[01:28:36.031 --> 01:28:37.392]  This evening?
[01:28:37.392 --> 01:28:39.634]  We're gonna, yep, that's right.
[01:28:39.634 --> 01:28:42.857]  We'll have those during the War Room and during Firepower tonight.
[01:28:42.857 --> 01:28:47.740]  You can find all the channels, all the shows, everything at BandVideo.
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:49.021]  Band.Video.
[01:28:49.021 --> 01:28:49.702]  Band.Video.
[01:28:49.702 --> 01:28:50.663]  Please share that link.
[01:28:50.663 --> 01:28:52.004]  We'll be right back with
[01:28:53.439 --> 01:28:56.261]  The biggest lie of last night.

[01:29:57.156 --> 01:30:20.682]  As I sit here recording this on the eve of September 11th, 2019, and I look back to that tragic event 18 years ago, it makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and have the Fire Department of New York and major construction and engineering firms come out and confirm that bombs were in Tower 1, Tower 2, and of course, Building 7.
[01:30:20.682 --> 01:30:21.383]  It's just pancakes.
[01:30:23.383 --> 01:30:42.672]  Then FBI Director Robert Mueller helped cover the whole thing up with the Saudis and to know that there's a deep state group working within our government with radical Islam who are using the threat of Islamic terror to take our basic liberties and freedoms while empowering and funding radical Islam to take over the planet.
[01:30:43.052 --> 01:30:52.666]  Well, 18 years later, I'm here to tell you that the world has awakened to 9-11, and InfoWars, and our researchers, and our guests, our whistleblowers have been vindicated yet again.
[01:30:52.666 --> 01:30:54.829]  That's why InfoWars.com is more important than ever.
[01:30:56.676 --> 01:31:02.418]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[01:31:02.418 --> 01:31:07.159]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[01:31:07.159 --> 01:31:10.641]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[01:31:10.641 --> 01:31:12.001]  It's been a bestseller.
[01:31:12.001 --> 01:31:23.565]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[01:31:24.025 --> 01:31:33.673]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[01:31:33.673 --> 01:31:38.918]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[01:31:39.178 --> 01:31:43.359]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[01:31:43.359 --> 01:31:47.101]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:50.121]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[01:31:50.121 --> 01:31:54.403]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[01:31:56.434 --> 01:32:03.842]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you, the products at Infowarslife.com are.
[01:32:03.842 --> 01:32:17.137]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[01:32:17.637 --> 01:32:24.283]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[01:32:24.283 --> 01:32:26.064]  It sells itself.
[01:32:26.064 --> 01:32:34.972]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[01:32:34.972 --> 01:32:36.173]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[01:32:36.673 --> 01:32:49.040]  Well, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, and it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:52.402]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[01:32:52.402 --> 01:32:59.606]  50% off on Body's at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:59.606 --> 01:33:02.247]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:15.821]  I believe in you!
[01:33:15.821 --> 01:33:19.183]  I don't think you're stupid!
[01:33:19.183 --> 01:33:22.345]  One man, everyone's a woman!
[01:33:22.345 --> 01:33:24.206]  All genitals were cut off!
[01:33:24.206 --> 01:33:26.767]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:29.449]  And we're not backing down ever!
[01:33:29.449 --> 01:33:31.090]  I want to get these people!
[01:33:31.090 --> 01:33:31.650]  We're winning!
[01:33:31.650 --> 01:33:32.911]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[01:33:32.911 --> 01:33:33.671]  Can't you?
[01:33:33.671 --> 01:33:35.672]  We have broken their back!
[01:33:35.672 --> 01:33:36.773]  Yes, I can feel it!
[01:33:40.646 --> 01:33:41.046]  Let's go!
[01:33:41.046 --> 01:33:41.306]  Come on!

[01:33:54.736 --> 01:33:54.956]  Come on!
[01:33:54.956 --> 01:33:55.517]  Come on!
[01:33:55.517 --> 01:33:56.057]  Come on!
[01:33:56.057 --> 01:33:56.457]  Come on!
[01:33:56.457 --> 01:33:56.817]  Come on!
[01:33:56.817 --> 01:33:57.098]  Come on!
[01:33:57.098 --> 01:33:57.298]  Come on!
[01:33:57.298 --> 01:33:57.578]  Come on!
[01:33:57.578 --> 01:33:57.778]  Come on!
[01:33:57.778 --> 01:33:57.958]  Come on!
[01:33:57.958 --> 01:33:58.218]  Come on!
[01:33:58.218 --> 01:33:58.499]  Come on!
[01:33:58.499 --> 01:33:58.899]  Come on!
[01:33:58.899 --> 01:33:59.159]  Come on!
[01:33:59.159 --> 01:33:59.459]  Come on!
[01:33:59.459 --> 01:34:00.160]  Come on!
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:00.400]  Come on!
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:00.720]  Come on!
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:00.940]  Come on!
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:01.221]  Come on!
[01:34:01.221 --> 01:34:01.541]  Come on!
[01:34:01.541 --> 01:34:01.801]  Come on!
[01:34:01.801 --> 01:34:01.981]  Come on!
[01:34:01.981 --> 01:34:02.201]  Come on!
[01:34:02.201 --> 01:34:02.561]  Come on!
[01:34:02.561 --> 01:34:02.742]  Come on!
[01:34:02.742 --> 01:34:02.902]  Come on!
[01:34:02.902 --> 01:34:03.102]  Come on!
[01:34:03.102 --> 01:34:03.222]  Come
[01:34:19.311 --> 01:34:33.262]  Alright, let me just slow down here, okay?
[01:34:33.262 --> 01:34:35.183]  And I really should be opening the phones up as well.
[01:34:35.183 --> 01:34:36.984]  This is so historic to give you a chance to respond.
[01:34:36.984 --> 01:34:37.505]  In fact, I will.
[01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:48.663]  No one has ever been charged at the top of the FBI.
[01:34:48.663 --> 01:35:04.633]  It's been able to basically get away with whatever it wants since it was set up in the 1920s, 1930s by J Edgar Hoover, who was its director until the early 1970s.
[01:35:04.633 --> 01:35:07.495]  And obviously any central federal police power
[01:35:08.743 --> 01:35:14.186]  is going to tend to become draconian, authoritarian, and oppressive.
[01:35:14.186 --> 01:35:32.177]  The German Gestapo, the Russian NKVD, the Roman Praetorian, the French Federal Police, the Italian Federal Police, MI5 in the UK.
[01:35:32.177 --> 01:35:34.578]  Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[01:35:36.311 --> 01:35:45.633]  Now, the average FBI agent, as federal agencies go around the world, has been somewhat of not as corrupt compared to other countries.
[01:35:45.633 --> 01:35:47.073]  He didn't get corrupt as fast.
[01:35:47.073 --> 01:36:04.197]  I mean, Hoover did a lot of blackmail and going after communists and anarchists and obviously had his problems, but he was not an anti-American institution, from my research, until the Clintons got in, in the 90s, and they put their people in.
[01:36:05.424 --> 01:36:10.606]  And they are still in there today, and they are bad news.
[01:36:10.606 --> 01:36:13.747]  Herbert Walker put a lot of bad ones in, so really it started with him.
[01:36:13.747 --> 01:36:18.770]  The real decline of the FBI.
[01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:23.191]  Because I don't want to just tear up American institutions for no reason.
[01:36:23.191 --> 01:36:24.352]  The globalists want to do that.
[01:36:24.352 --> 01:36:27.273]  They want to tear up the police, so they can federalize and globalize them.
[01:36:27.273 --> 01:36:29.314]  That's what the demoralization and the attacks are there.
[01:36:32.276 --> 01:36:34.778]  But I want to explain something.
[01:36:34.778 --> 01:36:50.650]  The fact that the Deputy Attorney General did not listen to this administrative appeal means there has been a indictment brought forward, a recommendation to prosecute, and that that's going to happen.
[01:36:50.650 --> 01:36:51.991]  We know the grand juries are open.
[01:36:51.991 --> 01:36:54.533]  That's not Q stuff that's nebulous.
[01:36:54.533 --> 01:36:59.157]  That was admitted a year ago, there were grand juries open in Virginia and Maryland on Andrew McCabe.
[01:37:01.025 --> 01:37:03.587]  So, that's confirmed stuff.
[01:37:03.587 --> 01:37:09.351]  And I told you then, I said, even before that came out, that they're looking to indict him.
[01:37:09.351 --> 01:37:15.676]  Now, I got another clip coming up that I just grabbed off Fox News during the break, that we're going to have next hour.
[01:37:15.676 --> 01:37:26.705]  Rob New's dumping it out, he's going to put it out on InfoHorse, where they're already maneuvering it and going, oh, he did it all himself to give his wife $600,000 and the fake dossier.
[01:37:26.705 --> 01:37:29.367]  So, McCabe is the fall guy.
[01:37:30.828 --> 01:37:37.351]  But so many crimes have been committed that they've got to at least burn somebody.
[01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:39.071]  Here's the deal.
[01:37:39.071 --> 01:37:43.433]  He said he's going to sing like a canary.
[01:37:43.433 --> 01:37:44.413]  So this is real.
[01:37:44.413 --> 01:37:45.674]  This is happening.
[01:37:45.674 --> 01:37:46.414]  This is going on.
[01:37:46.414 --> 01:37:49.175]  It means Trump's moving against the deep state.
[01:37:49.175 --> 01:37:50.776]  And it means we're in a whole other ballgame.
[01:37:50.776 --> 01:37:52.657]  This has never happened to an FBI director.
[01:37:52.657 --> 01:37:56.838]  So here's Barnes breaking it down yesterday with precision.
[01:37:56.838 --> 01:37:58.399]  Countdown, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:59.318 --> 01:38:00.660]  Andrew McCabe.
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:02.583]  The decision's been made to indict him.
[01:38:03.604 --> 01:38:04.244]  Exactly.
[01:38:04.244 --> 01:38:06.685]  The breaking news today is that U.S.
[01:38:06.685 --> 01:38:32.457]  Attorney Jesse Lew has chosen and decided already, has made the referral, and the referral has been approved and authorized to indict Andrew McCabe, the former director of the FBI, the former deputy director of the FBI, the key decision maker in the Clinton email case, the Clinton Foundation case, the orchestrator of the spy gate and coup attempts against the President of the United States, for his false statements to the FBI, for his false statements to the Office of
[01:38:32.657 --> 01:38:33.157]  We're good.
[01:38:50.106 --> 01:39:01.213]  It's an extraordinary case where the first deep state indictment really since Mark Felt in the late 1970s who ran COINTELPRO and was known as Deep Throat who secretly took out the Nixon administration.
[01:39:01.213 --> 01:39:08.978]  This is that's how significant and consequential this indictment is because the way the process works is there's a doctrine called the delegation doctrine.
[01:39:08.978 --> 01:39:10.539]  It's a constitutional process about
[01:39:10.839 --> 01:39:14.201]  Who has the approval and who has the authority to indict?
[01:39:14.201 --> 01:39:16.362]  While a grand jury has an indict, only a U.S.
[01:39:16.362 --> 01:39:20.625]  attorney can bring that case to the grand jury for the purposes of an indictment.
[01:39:20.625 --> 01:39:26.808]  And the way that works is, if it's a particular kind of case, tax case, has to go to a particular U.S.
[01:39:26.808 --> 01:39:28.369]  attorney in charge of the tax division.
[01:39:28.889 --> 01:39:37.111]  If it's a certain kind of political case involving a high-ranking government official, then it has to be approved of by the Deputy Director, the Deputy U.S.
[01:39:37.111 --> 01:39:41.432]  Attorney, the number two in the United States Department of Justice, which is Jeffrey Rosen.
[01:39:41.432 --> 01:39:43.412]  Today it's reported that he has approved it.
[01:39:43.412 --> 01:39:46.893]  That means the indictment is coming within days, within weeks.
[01:39:46.893 --> 01:39:53.734]  Andrew McCabe will be indicted by the Department of Justice for his crimes against the President of the United States and on behalf of the Clinton family.
[01:39:53.734 --> 01:39:58.195]  And against the voters of this country and our electoral system and our republic and this
[01:39:59.667 --> 01:40:11.237]  The aura of invincibility, of infallibility of the Clinton crime machine and the Obama crime machine will then evaporate and you'll start seeing many others turn state evidence very, very quickly.
[01:40:11.237 --> 01:40:15.201]  This is a giant moment for the Republic.
[01:40:15.201 --> 01:40:21.426]  This is approaching the level of when the British sued for peace 240 years ago.
[01:40:21.426 --> 01:40:24.069]  This is so massive, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:28.011]  You're going to see major counter-strikes, though.
[01:40:28.011 --> 01:40:35.615]  I suspect if they're ever going to try to kill Trump, or ever try to stage a big terror attack or something, this is when the deep state is about to fire all barrels.
[01:40:35.615 --> 01:40:43.119]  Well, in fact, I would say that this message is partially that, because apparently the source for this story coming out is McCabe himself.
[01:40:43.119 --> 01:40:48.822]  It's McCabe's legal team sending the message, by the way, I'm about to get targeted, I'm about to get hit.
[01:40:48.822 --> 01:40:51.143]  So it's a peculiar kind of timing.
[01:40:51.143 --> 01:40:54.325]  If I was McCabe's people, I wouldn't necessarily put this out to the public.
[01:40:54.705 --> 01:41:03.548]  Now, he did raise almost $700,000 for a legal defense fund earlier, so maybe he's planning on doing a fundraiser.
[01:41:03.548 --> 01:41:04.728]  What about Arkansas?
[01:41:04.728 --> 01:41:06.969]  What about his family getting life insurance on him?
[01:41:06.969 --> 01:41:12.391]  I mean, I think this guy has as much longevity and a shelf life of Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:41:12.631 --> 01:41:13.932]  Well, there's two things about McCabe.
[01:41:13.932 --> 01:41:20.458]  He has made clear to everybody for a long time that he'll rat out anybody and everybody to save his own hide.
[01:41:20.458 --> 01:41:21.279]  That's number one.
[01:41:21.279 --> 01:41:26.584]  Number two, he's the source of letting everybody know, hey, by the way, he's about to get indicted.
[01:41:26.584 --> 01:41:30.087]  So that's a very sort of peculiar thing to do if you want to protect yourself.
[01:41:30.087 --> 01:41:38.995]  The third aspect with him is that, put it this way, if you're an insurance company, would you give life insurance right now to Andrew McCabe without some special exceptions for unusual and unexplained deaths?
[01:41:39.275 --> 01:41:47.239]  Kayak accidents, heart attacks, slipping and... It will insure you as long as your death can be fully and completely explained.
[01:41:47.239 --> 01:41:50.061]  But any unexplained death, sorry, no insurance for that.
[01:41:50.061 --> 01:41:53.423]  No sudden, you know, weird ways of... Car wrecks.
[01:41:53.423 --> 01:41:56.765]  Yeah, no car wrecks, no weird way, no sudden unexplained heart attacks.
[01:41:56.765 --> 01:41:57.745]  No falling down stairs.
[01:41:57.745 --> 01:41:58.586]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:58.586 --> 01:42:00.006]  None of that.
[01:42:00.006 --> 01:42:04.749]  No committing suicide while you're temporarily in federal custody under a video camera.
[01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:06.791]  Nothing like that.
[01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:08.032]  It will be interesting to see.
[01:42:08.032 --> 01:42:11.454]  Now, he does have intel and information literally on everybody.
[01:42:11.454 --> 01:42:16.919]  I mean, if you wanted to talk about a deep state hatchet man with all the information and intel, it is Andrew McCabe.
[01:42:16.919 --> 01:42:19.461]  Covered up with the Clintons, the foundation, the emails.
[01:42:19.461 --> 01:42:21.743]  He ran the counter-espionage unit.
[01:42:21.743 --> 01:42:26.507]  So, you're talking about a guy who knows everything about Peter Strzok, knows everything about everybody.
[01:42:26.507 --> 01:42:28.289]  Alright, folks, we're going to go to break.
[01:42:28.769 --> 01:42:32.911]  That 15 minutes, that's only five minutes of it, it's up on Infowars.com.
[01:42:32.911 --> 01:42:34.772]  It's powerful and it's dead on.
[01:42:34.772 --> 01:42:36.853]  That means the indictment's coming.
[01:42:36.853 --> 01:42:40.855]  It's gone up, hoping that the number two, that's his job to kill it if he was.
[01:42:40.855 --> 01:42:41.755]  Didn't kill it.
[01:42:41.755 --> 01:42:43.196]  Because Rosenstein's out.
[01:42:43.196 --> 01:42:44.896]  Rosenstein used to have that position.
[01:42:44.896 --> 01:42:45.557]  It's on.
[01:42:45.557 --> 01:42:47.077]  Trump's moving against him.
[01:42:47.077 --> 01:42:48.058]  It's happening.
[01:42:48.058 --> 01:42:49.779]  Thank you, Jesus!
[01:42:49.779 --> 01:42:51.960]  We'll be right back on the other side!
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.180]  Infowars!
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:54.081]  Never surrenders!
[01:42:56.275 --> 01:43:04.819]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[01:43:04.819 --> 01:43:09.461]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[01:43:09.461 --> 01:43:16.344]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[01:43:16.824 --> 01:43:26.550]  I was the first to warn you, along with Paul Watson and Infowars.com, 15 years ago, that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do.
[01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:40.940]  And hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy, that our government in Hollywood had been taken over by the Communist Chinese, on every one of these issues and many others.
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:45.406]  We've been dead on, and we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale.
[01:43:45.406 --> 01:43:47.550]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:52.017]  And that's why you are more critical than ever to support the Infowar.
[01:43:52.017 --> 01:43:54.340]  Please support the Infowar however you can.

[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:00.643]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[01:45:00.643 --> 01:45:05.406]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[01:45:05.406 --> 01:45:07.647]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[01:45:07.647 --> 01:45:09.648]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12.
[01:45:09.648 --> 01:45:12.050]  The very best vitamin B12 out there.
[01:45:12.050 --> 01:45:17.133]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[01:45:17.133 --> 01:45:18.974]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[01:45:18.974 --> 01:45:20.255]  Helps make DNA.
[01:45:20.255 --> 01:45:21.595]  Helps the body produce energy.
[01:45:21.595 --> 01:45:23.076]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[01:45:23.076 --> 01:45:25.097]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[01:45:25.097 --> 01:45:25.838]  It goes on and on.
[01:45:26.058 --> 01:45:34.160]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:36.700]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.

[01:45:57.034 --> 01:46:02.776]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[01:46:02.776 --> 01:46:07.498]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[01:46:07.498 --> 01:46:10.979]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[01:46:10.979 --> 01:46:12.340]  It's been a bestseller.
[01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:23.904]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[01:46:24.364 --> 01:46:34.016]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[01:46:34.016 --> 01:46:39.262]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[01:46:39.522 --> 01:46:47.470]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price, and it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:50.453]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[01:46:50.453 --> 01:46:59.121]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[01:46:59.121 --> 01:47:01.723]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.864 --> 01:47:14.890]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:47:14.890 --> 01:47:18.233]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:18.233 --> 01:47:23.179]  I'm coming in tomorrow to do a new show that's gonna be on TV satellite.
[01:47:23.179 --> 01:47:24.920]  We'll put it on radio satellite as well.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:28.905]  But it's just gonna have breaks at the start in the middle of the hour.
[01:47:28.905 --> 01:47:30.607]  So it'll have like...
[01:47:31.867 --> 01:47:34.928]  8 minutes of ads instead of 14 minutes of ads or whatever.
[01:47:34.928 --> 01:47:38.450]  And it's going to be the InfoWars Roundtable Show that's going to be caller-based.
[01:47:38.450 --> 01:47:44.032]  And once we kind of have the training wheels off, you'll still have somebody here that helps quarterback stuff, but you'll have the callers.
[01:47:44.032 --> 01:47:45.752]  Some of the best callers over the years.
[01:47:45.752 --> 01:47:46.913]  We've been getting their numbers.
[01:47:46.913 --> 01:47:49.654]  Info had this idea like five years ago, never implemented it.
[01:47:50.874 --> 01:47:59.797]  Post the show, and then I may even go a few more hours and just open the phones up to everybody to talk about all the stuff that's happening, because usually when history takes place, people don't recognize it.
[01:47:59.797 --> 01:48:06.940]  And later they say, wow, we didn't realize the amazing time that we were all living in.
[01:48:06.940 --> 01:48:10.381]  But again, everybody just kept saying, oh, the indictments aren't going to happen.
[01:48:10.381 --> 01:48:11.142]  Oh, it isn't going to happen.
[01:48:11.142 --> 01:48:19.605]  And when we came on air yesterday and said, no, no, this is the procedure, they appealed it administratively up inside the government.
[01:48:20.387 --> 01:48:23.127]  To where they're going to prosecute their own people.
[01:48:23.127 --> 01:48:24.468]  It's very incestuous.
[01:48:24.468 --> 01:48:25.268]  It's corrupt.
[01:48:25.268 --> 01:48:26.128]  I don't like it.
[01:48:26.128 --> 01:48:29.329]  Rosenstein was protecting all these criminals.
[01:48:29.329 --> 01:48:29.949]  He's out.
[01:48:29.949 --> 01:48:33.669]  Now there's the new Deputy Attorney General, Rosen.
[01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:39.150]  And they said, no, we're not going to say don't prosecute.
[01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:40.470]  So that means it's happening.
[01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:42.031]  Robert Barnes is a big criminal lawyer.
[01:48:42.031 --> 01:48:45.551]  It's what he used to do before he did First Amendment and all that.
[01:48:45.551 --> 01:48:47.692]  I mean, he's a famous criminal lawyer.
[01:48:47.692 --> 01:48:48.792]  Very high success rate.
[01:48:50.326 --> 01:48:54.428]  I mean, I wouldn't put him in a Racehorse Hanes level, because no one else was in a Racehorse Hanes level.
[01:48:54.428 --> 01:48:55.949]  He's right there.
[01:48:55.949 --> 01:48:56.610]  Okay?
[01:48:56.610 --> 01:48:58.851]  And he knows all the procedures.
[01:48:58.851 --> 01:49:01.033]  Okay?
[01:49:01.033 --> 01:49:02.874]  It's happening.
[01:49:02.874 --> 01:49:06.296]  Unless they change procedures, which has never been done.
[01:49:06.296 --> 01:49:10.579]  And sure enough, it's on Fox News, he's being indicted now.
[01:49:10.579 --> 01:49:12.501]  So, all hell's gonna break loose.
[01:49:14.298 --> 01:49:19.642]  I've been telling you since the last hour that I'm going to get to their big plan and how to stop them on the gun grab.
[01:49:19.642 --> 01:49:30.291]  You need to understand, I know you know this, but for folks that don't, you need to tell them that they're losing so they want to start a civil war.
[01:49:30.291 --> 01:49:33.673]  They're going to have leftist jurisdictions come and start taking the guns and killing people.
[01:49:33.673 --> 01:49:36.716]  They're already killing folks all over with red flag laws.
[01:49:36.716 --> 01:49:39.438]  They've got leftist police departments that are on the dole ready to do this.
[01:49:41.459 --> 01:49:43.740]  They've caught police departments working with antifa as well.
[01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:45.880]  That's been in the documents.
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:47.360]  I'm not saying the police on average are bad.
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:49.761]  They're some of the best people I've found on average.
[01:49:49.761 --> 01:49:53.722]  Because they're actually living in the real world and are informed.
[01:49:53.722 --> 01:49:58.683]  Compared to, you know, one-fifth of Americans who study don't even know one branch of the government.
[01:49:58.683 --> 01:50:01.044]  Don't you want to bet those are Democrats?
[01:50:01.044 --> 01:50:04.885]  But, they're not going to give up, okay?
[01:50:04.885 --> 01:50:09.206]  So, I don't even have anxiety anymore.
[01:50:09.206 --> 01:50:09.886]  I don't even have
[01:50:11.633 --> 01:50:13.653]  Like the feeling like I've got to work harder to fight these people.
[01:50:13.653 --> 01:50:15.414]  I'm getting tingles all over me right now.
[01:50:15.414 --> 01:50:19.454]  I mean, I'm ready to kick some ass.
[01:50:19.454 --> 01:50:21.975]  And I'm not saying I'm going to go out and do anything violent.
[01:50:21.975 --> 01:50:28.056]  I'm saying my body, physiologically, intellectually, has looked at all this, and at a spiritual level can feel it.
[01:50:28.056 --> 01:50:34.257]  And my body is just like, I mean, it's like on fire.
[01:50:34.257 --> 01:50:35.718]  It's not fire, it's like a chill.
[01:50:35.718 --> 01:50:36.598]  You know what I'm talking about.
[01:50:40.066 --> 01:50:41.647]  That's because we're in the flux.
[01:50:41.647 --> 01:50:42.887]  We're in the warp.
[01:50:42.887 --> 01:50:44.768]  We're in the crossroad right now.
[01:50:44.768 --> 01:50:46.769]  We're in the destiny decision.
[01:50:46.769 --> 01:50:47.810]  We're at the moment of truth.
[01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:56.613]  Like that moment you ask out the woman who ends up being your wife and you live with her forever and love her and have five kids with her.
[01:50:56.613 --> 01:50:59.175]  You know, it's you know that magic moment.
[01:50:59.175 --> 01:51:00.615]  But it could go either way.
[01:51:00.615 --> 01:51:04.197]  Hell one way and a good future the other.
[01:51:04.197 --> 01:51:06.058]  Now I'm going to stop right there before I play these new clips.
[01:51:07.179 --> 01:51:15.784]  From Fox News on this, with a great idea that one of my former security guys, really smart fellow, went back to Florida to take care of his family, came up with.
[01:51:15.784 --> 01:51:22.308]  Because I told my whole crew this morning, I came in and I said, I want the t-shirt to rebuke Beto O'Rourke.
[01:51:22.308 --> 01:51:28.072]  And I went to my graphics people and I said, come up with something.
[01:51:28.072 --> 01:51:28.852]  They said, well what do you think?
[01:51:28.852 --> 01:51:30.373]  I said, I can't come up with anything.
[01:51:30.373 --> 01:51:32.494]  From our cold dead hands, Beto?
[01:51:32.494 --> 01:51:34.976]  Or, you know, come and take it, scumbag Beto?
[01:51:36.647 --> 01:51:45.189]  But I was so frustrated, and then my buddy, 30 minutes ago, Dr. McCamshaw, please, sends me this and says, you need to put this shirt out.
[01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:46.329]  I just came up with the idea.
[01:51:46.329 --> 01:51:49.150]  It's got the Texas star, the Army star.
[01:51:49.150 --> 01:51:52.891]  It's got a, you know, M4.
[01:51:52.891 --> 01:51:54.491]  They want to ban AR-15.
[01:51:54.491 --> 01:51:55.351]  Beto not.
[01:51:55.351 --> 01:51:56.332]  Better not.
[01:51:56.332 --> 01:51:57.592]  That is the shirt!
[01:51:58.775 --> 01:52:03.438]  And Pipe Hitters Union, owned by a bunch of patriot veterans right here in Texas.
[01:52:03.438 --> 01:52:04.459]  Can't beat that.
[01:52:04.459 --> 01:52:09.963]  Made in Texas, printed in Texas, unlike that scallywag Beto.
[01:52:09.963 --> 01:52:12.845]  And they're printing these right now.
[01:52:12.845 --> 01:52:14.426]  I just said, boom, you got a deal.
[01:52:14.426 --> 01:52:15.887]  They're printing them right now.
[01:52:15.887 --> 01:52:20.751]  It's going up in the next 30 minutes to infowarestore.com.
[01:52:20.751 --> 01:52:24.733]  And the purchase funds this operation.
[01:52:24.733 --> 01:52:28.196]  And the veteran that came up with the idea, my buddy, gets 50 cents a shirt to help him out.
[01:52:30.942 --> 01:52:36.584]  And so this is very, very, very, very, very exciting.
[01:52:36.584 --> 01:52:40.125]  This is very, very exciting.
[01:52:40.125 --> 01:52:41.445]  So this is the shirt.
[01:52:41.445 --> 01:52:42.025]  It is the shirt.
[01:52:42.025 --> 01:52:44.966]  When he told me this is the shirt, I know he's not a BSer.
[01:52:44.966 --> 01:52:46.867]  He's a smart guy.
[01:52:46.867 --> 01:52:48.187]  And there it is.
[01:52:48.187 --> 01:52:52.649]  Beto Knott, if you're a radio listener, it's not up on InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:52:52.649 --> 01:52:58.790]  The shirt literally will start printing today.
[01:52:58.790 --> 01:53:00.391]  I will have these by Tuesday.
[01:53:01.516 --> 01:53:07.380]  It's a limited edition shirt that makes it more fun and it will fund our operation.
[01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:08.961]  Beto Knot.
[01:53:08.961 --> 01:53:14.024]  It's a light gray shirt with the Texas little star, the Army star.
[01:53:14.024 --> 01:53:16.205]  They're both ubiquitous.
[01:53:16.205 --> 01:53:24.390]  The M4 Beto Knot designed by a veteran.
[01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:28.012]  And that's the perfect counter printed right here in Texas.
[01:53:28.012 --> 01:53:29.413]  We're going to make it.
[01:53:32.089 --> 01:53:37.711]  $19.95 to move these babies, even though the shirt is good fabric, so it costs more than, you know, I think they're giving me a deal.
[01:53:37.711 --> 01:53:39.932]  I think I'm going to get the shirt for like $8 or whatever.
[01:53:39.932 --> 01:53:43.194]  The point is, is that this fabric is expensive.
[01:53:43.194 --> 01:53:44.875]  Beto not get it.
[01:53:44.875 --> 01:53:48.757]  Infowarsstore.com and turn their hate of the Second Amendment into resistance.
[01:53:48.757 --> 01:53:49.957]  You've got to wear this.
[01:53:49.957 --> 01:53:51.118]  You've got to get this.
[01:53:51.118 --> 01:53:52.138]  You've got to fund this.
[01:53:52.138 --> 01:53:53.679]  They're trying to shut us down.
[01:53:53.679 --> 01:53:55.220]  We've got a bunch of supplements on sale.
[01:53:57.483 --> 01:53:58.904]  That's what it costs us to make, folks.
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:23.381]  Eight-pack PowerStack, 67% off.
[01:54:23.381 --> 01:54:27.464]  Never done a deal that good, because everything's got to move to fund this and buy more product for next year.
[01:54:27.464 --> 01:54:29.765]  60% off liver and kidney care.
[01:54:29.765 --> 01:54:30.825]  Icarin, amazing.
[01:54:30.825 --> 01:54:31.686]  You owe it to yourself.
[01:54:31.686 --> 01:54:32.907]  These are things you need.
[01:54:32.907 --> 01:54:33.847]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:54:33.847 --> 01:54:37.049]  Okay, I'm going to stop right there.
[01:54:37.049 --> 01:54:43.353]  Let's get to Catherine Harrington on the attempts of McCabe Legal Team to prevent indictment.
[01:54:43.353 --> 01:54:43.693]  Here it is.
[01:54:44.679 --> 01:55:00.609]  Andrew McCabe is one step closer to criminal prosecution after a source close to his legal team confirmed to Fox News that the Justice Department had rejected this last-minute appeal, and this morning we've confirmed his legal team made three separate attempts to shut down charges.
[01:55:00.609 --> 01:55:02.730]  McCabe's team recently met with the U.S.
[01:55:02.730 --> 01:55:09.474]  Attorney for Washington, D.C., Jessie Liu, and made a personal appeal for her office not to move forward with prosecution.
[01:55:09.474 --> 01:55:13.517]  Then they met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to make the same argument.
[01:55:14.037 --> 01:55:22.320]  Then McCabe's team sent a quote extensive letter to Rosen laying out their legal arguments and it was still rejected by the Deputy Attorney General.
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:22.760]  The U.S.
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:29.443]  Attorney is recommending charges against McCabe based on the findings of a 2018 Inspector General report.
[01:55:29.443 --> 01:55:38.346]  He found McCabe misled or lied to federal investigators about his role in a media leak that confirmed the FBI was investigating the Clinton Foundation.
[01:55:38.946 --> 01:55:49.517]  Michael E. Horowitz also found McCabe violated FBI media policy because the disclosure one week before the 2016 presidential election was not in the public interest.
[01:55:49.517 --> 01:55:58.146]  Rather, it was designed to benefit McCabe and push back against criticism he was compromised because his wife took more than $600,000 from Democrats for a 2015 state Senate race.
[01:56:01.329 --> 01:56:19.117]  This morning, a senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee said the McCabe allegations should not be seen in isolation, given just last week the same Inspector General, Michael E. Horowitz, found McCabe's boss, former Director Comey, is a leaker who violated FBI policy as well as his employment agreement.
[01:56:20.373 --> 01:56:31.511]  You look at the most recent IG report on James Comey and you put this all together and you're starting to see a picture of this what I would call a soft coup attempt and Andy McCabe was right at the heart of it.
[01:56:32.208 --> 01:56:34.930]  Okay, I called it a soft coup attempt three years ago.
[01:56:34.930 --> 01:56:36.070]  We're the first to break it all.
[01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:39.352]  I had intelligence agencies all over my ass.
[01:56:39.352 --> 01:56:43.014]  Luckily, there were a bunch of limp wristed leftists trying to find out who was feeding me info.
[01:56:43.014 --> 01:56:48.097]  You morons admitted all in Congress in your own filings, you dumb jackasses.
[01:56:48.097 --> 01:56:51.639]  You don't think I don't know how to go read what you're up to?
[01:56:51.639 --> 01:56:53.340]  But you guys don't sit around till 2 a.m.
[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:53.680]  reading.
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:56.422]  You're a bunch of lazy punks.
[01:56:56.422 --> 01:56:59.504]  We're gonna get your ass, you un-American chi-com traitors.
[01:57:00.851 --> 01:57:01.872]  And that's what they are.
[01:57:01.872 --> 01:57:03.913]  This isn't rhetoric.
[01:57:03.913 --> 01:57:06.115]  This is real.
[01:57:06.115 --> 01:57:08.136]  And this is the organic American resistance.
[01:57:08.136 --> 01:57:10.738]  We'll come back and play the really important clip.
[01:57:10.738 --> 01:57:12.639]  Congressman McClintock.
[01:57:12.639 --> 01:57:14.920]  And the indictment that's coming.
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:16.842]  He will be indicted.
[01:57:16.842 --> 01:57:18.063]  Watch.
[01:57:18.063 --> 01:57:18.763]  That's not hope.
[01:57:18.763 --> 01:57:21.205]  That's the procedure.
[01:57:21.205 --> 01:57:23.386]  You understand how much trouble they're in?
[01:57:23.386 --> 01:57:25.928]  This is the time they can move against Trump.
[01:57:25.928 --> 01:57:28.590]  This is the time they can set off a bomb.
[01:57:28.590 --> 01:57:29.510]  A new Oklahoma City.
[01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:30.371]  It worked before for them.
[01:57:31.423 --> 01:57:33.845]  Everybody better watch their six right now.
[01:57:33.845 --> 01:57:35.886]  They've got their operatives in the field.
[01:57:35.886 --> 01:57:37.447]  They're moving right now.
[01:57:37.447 --> 01:57:39.309]  I'm not sure how they're gonna hit us.
[01:57:39.309 --> 01:57:43.592]  But everybody better know, we're in a war for the very existence of this country!
[01:57:46.027 --> 01:57:53.455]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you the products that Infowarslife.com are on.
[01:57:53.455 --> 01:58:02.524]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[01:58:03.104 --> 01:58:07.246]  And then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[01:58:07.246 --> 01:58:13.890]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[01:58:13.890 --> 01:58:15.651]  It sells itself.
[01:58:15.651 --> 01:58:23.695]  But normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[01:58:24.395 --> 01:58:26.276]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[01:58:26.276 --> 01:58:38.640]  Well, BODY'S Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, and it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.

[01:58:46.044 --> 01:58:50.265]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third bestseller.
[01:58:50.265 --> 01:58:55.027]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[01:58:55.027 --> 01:58:57.287]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[01:58:57.287 --> 01:58:59.268]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12.
[01:58:59.268 --> 01:59:01.669]  The very best vitamin B12 out there.
[01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:06.750]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[01:59:06.750 --> 01:59:08.591]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[01:59:08.591 --> 01:59:09.871]  Helps make DNA.
[01:59:09.871 --> 01:59:11.211]  Helps the body produce energy.
[01:59:11.211 --> 01:59:12.712]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[01:59:12.712 --> 01:59:13.472]  Essential for proper
[01:59:13.752 --> 01:59:15.694]  Nervous system function, it goes on and on.
[01:59:15.694 --> 01:59:23.800]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.

[01:59:58.533 --> 02:00:01.219]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:01.219 --> 02:00:06.351]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:00:10.066 --> 02:00:13.888]  Well, I mean, if equal justice under law means anything, of course he should be indicted.
[02:00:13.888 --> 02:00:26.875]  We've known for the last year the Inspector General believes that he lied under oath, and don't forget, this is one of the people who prosecuted Michael Flynn for simply lying to the FBI, not under oath.
[02:00:26.875 --> 02:00:31.878]  So, yes, he needs to be prosecuted, but we also need to keep this in perspective.
[02:00:31.878 --> 02:00:35.460]  This is basically a side event, just the tip of a much larger iceberg.
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:37.041]  McCabe was one of the central figures
[02:00:37.481 --> 02:00:55.656]  In using the awesome powers that we give to the Department of Justice, the FBI, and our intelligence agencies to concoct a sham investigation of the Trump campaign, and later the administration, over charges stemming from a dossier they knew to be false at the time.
[02:00:56.016 --> 02:01:04.982]  The next Inspector General's report will start to look at the abuse of the FISA, the secret court system, by people like McCabe.
[02:01:04.982 --> 02:01:11.307]  That's going to be far more significant because that was a direct assault on our democratic institutions as a nation.
[02:01:11.867 --> 02:01:13.668]  You know, it's interesting.
[02:01:13.668 --> 02:01:26.816]  It may have been for the first time that people heard the name Andy McCabe in those text messages between the FBI agents who were having a marital, extramarital affair, who were going back and forth indicating some bias, potentially, at the FBI.
[02:01:26.816 --> 02:01:33.020]  And they were talking about a guy named Andy, and it was perceived that that was Andy McCabe, their boss.
[02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:38.644]  Does it matter, the history there, and also what he lied about going forth?
[02:01:38.644 --> 02:01:40.285]  You know, you heard the President's attorney say,
[02:01:41.107 --> 02:01:42.918]  This isn't even the worst of what's to come.
[02:01:45.003 --> 02:01:47.365]  No, in fact, as I said, I think it's a side issue.
[02:01:47.365 --> 02:02:07.878]  I think the main issue, that discussion that you mentioned that was revealed in the Strzok page emails, involved a discussion using this completely false narrative of Russian collusion with Trump in order to undermine and obstruct the duly elected President of the United States.
[02:02:07.878 --> 02:02:12.601]  That was the insurance policy that Strzok referred to.
[02:02:12.961 --> 02:02:19.604]  That was all hatched, it appears, in Andrew McCabe's office when he was the Deputy Director of the FBI.
[02:02:19.604 --> 02:02:25.807]  That is how deep this corruption goes, and it may go much farther as you work your way up the chain of command.
[02:02:25.807 --> 02:02:29.949]  Congressman McClintock, what can you tell me about what's happening on Capitol Hill?
[02:02:29.949 --> 02:02:37.533]  Everybody's back to work after the summer break now, with regard to investigating the investigators, as the President has formally put it.
[02:02:37.533 --> 02:02:39.134]  But that's really what we're talking about here.
[02:02:41.075 --> 02:02:52.839]  Well, sadly, the House Judiciary Committee, under the leadership of the Democrats and Jerry Nadler, have absolutely no interest at all in investigating how this monstrous lie was concocted.
[02:02:52.839 --> 02:02:53.579]  Why not?
[02:02:53.579 --> 02:02:55.920]  How our intelligence... They're a pack of criminals, that's why.
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:01.862]  Because it's embarrassing to them, because it reveals that for the last three years they have perpetrated a massive lie
[02:03:02.142 --> 02:03:03.583]  Trying to sabotage America, but it didn't work.
[02:03:03.583 --> 02:03:07.084]  And by the way, I went ahead and had the crew get a bunch of these clubs for congressional hearings.
[02:03:07.084 --> 02:03:09.125]  We play one here, one there, every month as it happens.
[02:03:09.125 --> 02:03:11.966]  But I'm gonna shoot some video this weekend that we're gonna air next week.
[02:03:30.814 --> 02:03:58.239]  Like a little mini documentary we're going to air, where you're going to see the CIA, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Board of Governors of the FCC, and you're going to see all these hearings, the Department of Defense hearings, House Defense Committee hearings, Senate Intelligence Committee hearings, saying I'm a Russian agent three years ago, two years ago, and this year, and then taking me off the internet.
[02:03:58.239 --> 02:03:59.259]  That's what they really did.
[02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:05.172]  Then they made up all those excuses because they had an order to do it.
[02:04:05.172 --> 02:04:07.173]  They said I said racist stuff.
[02:04:07.173 --> 02:04:09.515]  They said I did all this other stuff I didn't even do.
[02:04:09.515 --> 02:04:11.256]  They said I beat up a kid on video.
[02:04:11.256 --> 02:04:13.117]  Totally made up!
[02:04:13.117 --> 02:04:15.538]  They say I lost a Sandy Hook suit for a book I wrote.
[02:04:15.538 --> 02:04:16.279]  Never wrote a book!
[02:04:16.279 --> 02:04:17.379]  It's a total lie!
[02:04:17.379 --> 02:04:19.981]  AP!
[02:04:19.981 --> 02:04:21.282]  They're on the list to file suit on.
[02:04:21.282 --> 02:04:26.225]  We've decided to do it in two weeks now to see how the federal suits look to line them up with those, but it's gonna happen.
[02:04:27.912 --> 02:04:29.552]  You know, I'm not a victim here.
[02:04:29.552 --> 02:04:32.793]  I'm saying we're all victims of a lie.
[02:04:32.793 --> 02:04:36.094]  It's the CIA doing all that to me.
[02:04:36.094 --> 02:04:37.495]  To Trump, to you.
[02:04:37.495 --> 02:04:39.155]  It's not our CIA.
[02:04:39.155 --> 02:04:42.536]  It's leftists on the Chinese payroll.
[02:04:42.536 --> 02:04:44.817]  They're all gonna have to go to prison that we're involved.
[02:04:44.817 --> 02:04:46.558]  It's not everybody in the government.
[02:04:46.558 --> 02:04:48.778]  It's a large portion of them.
[02:04:48.778 --> 02:04:50.119]  This country's fighting for its life.
[02:04:50.119 --> 02:04:51.259]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:54.702 --> 02:04:57.684]  Happies is a tincture that you take under the tongue.

[02:06:04.002 --> 02:06:06.223]  We're on the run.
[02:06:06.223 --> 02:06:10.285]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:06:10.285 --> 02:06:12.506]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:12.506 --> 02:06:13.546]  All right.
[02:06:13.546 --> 02:06:20.709]  Until about 45 after, Reverend Leonard Childress has been coming on the show probably 15 years or so.
[02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:24.671]  Blackgenocide.org is going to come on because
[02:06:25.575 --> 02:06:45.079]  When you hear them push all this stuff about Planned Parenthood and, you know, Trump's a racist and all that, I think you need to hear from somebody who's probably done more research than even I've done, and who's produced films and screened them to Congress and done more than most people that are prominent in the pro-life movement.
[02:06:47.677 --> 02:06:48.038]  Come on.
[02:07:01.198 --> 02:07:04.301]  Six, seven minute compilation for Reverend Childress.
[02:07:04.301 --> 02:07:11.188]  And then after he's gone, the last segment of this hour, I'm going to get into how the left's coming for the guns, how they want to start a civil war, how that's part of the plan and how to stop it.
[02:07:11.188 --> 02:07:12.910]  Such a critical last segment.
[02:07:12.910 --> 02:07:15.233]  Then something special in the fourth hour, I'll tell you about.
[02:07:15.233 --> 02:07:22.200]  But I wanted to play this first for the Reverend because I told the crew last week, I said, or I guess early this week, I said,
[02:07:23.473 --> 02:07:29.996]  Hey, we've got all those clips when we walk up to Democrats in the street and they start saying, I want to kill kids up to age three, they're parasites, I hate them.
[02:07:29.996 --> 02:07:31.777]  Get some of those clips.
[02:07:31.777 --> 02:07:35.759]  Well, McBreen ended up putting together like 30 minutes of it.
[02:07:35.759 --> 02:07:38.240]  I said, they cut it down to like six, seven minutes.
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:43.683]  But now there's the new fetish in the national news of getting pregnant to kill the baby.
[02:07:43.683 --> 02:07:45.524]  And the women say it's an act of selfishness.
[02:07:45.524 --> 02:07:45.984]  I love it.
[02:07:46.724 --> 02:07:56.632]  I love the power I have, and now they're calling them babies, and saying we're going to kill the babies, and they're keeping them alive, and selling their organs, and imposing on the dead bodies.
[02:07:56.632 --> 02:07:59.174]  Nothing's too macabre for these people.
[02:07:59.174 --> 02:08:00.154]  You can't make this up.
[02:08:00.154 --> 02:08:02.736]  I know you're hearing this, and it's like, this isn't real.
[02:08:02.736 --> 02:08:04.258]  No, this is when the bottom drops out.
[02:08:05.279 --> 02:08:08.241]  Every culture, when it collapses, starts sacrificing children.
[02:08:08.241 --> 02:08:12.003]  The left's been doing it covertly, now they're overtly externalizing it.
[02:08:12.003 --> 02:08:13.223]  Hey, we want your guns!
[02:08:13.223 --> 02:08:15.665]  We're going to have drag queen story time with convicted pedophiles!
[02:08:15.665 --> 02:08:18.306]  The kids are going to ride horsey!
[02:08:18.306 --> 02:08:19.346]  We're going to groom your kids!
[02:08:19.346 --> 02:08:19.907]  It's all out in the open.
[02:08:19.907 --> 02:08:23.969]  So I'm going to play this in the Reverend Childress' take, but here's the report.
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:30.162]  Our main story tonight concerns breast implants.
[02:08:30.162 --> 02:08:37.566]  Some are against them, others believe they're fine in rare cases, and many believe you should be able to get them whenever the f**k you want.
[02:08:37.566 --> 02:08:39.487]  Sorry, did I say breast implants?
[02:08:39.487 --> 02:08:40.928]  I meant abortions.
[02:08:40.928 --> 02:08:43.749]  Tonight's main topic concerns abortion.
[02:08:43.749 --> 02:08:52.474]  So tonight, in honor of America, I'd like to do a salute to abortion in the brave 10th annual Salute to Abortion!
[02:08:55.089 --> 02:08:56.590]  Get out of my behind!
[02:08:56.590 --> 02:08:58.131]  Get out of my vagina!
[02:08:58.131 --> 02:08:59.132]  Get out!
[02:08:59.132 --> 02:09:03.034]  It's a woman's body and she should not be forced to carry anything inside of it.
[02:09:03.034 --> 02:09:05.316]  Wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm.
[02:09:05.316 --> 02:09:06.237]  That has a heartbeat.
[02:09:06.237 --> 02:09:08.358]  So you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm?
[02:09:08.358 --> 02:09:10.499]  A fetus is a parasite, sweetie.
[02:09:10.499 --> 02:09:12.661]  That is not what a fetus looks like, okay?
[02:09:12.661 --> 02:09:14.682]  It's a bunch of cells in 12 weeks.
[02:09:14.682 --> 02:09:19.005]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[02:09:19.005 --> 02:09:20.606]  How many did you adopt?
[02:09:20.606 --> 02:09:21.887]  How many did I adopt?
[02:09:21.887 --> 02:09:22.788]  I kill my kids.
[02:09:22.788 --> 02:09:23.988]  I kill my kids.
[02:09:25.429 --> 02:09:27.051]  You've got Amazing Grace being sung.
[02:09:27.051 --> 02:09:31.294]  I don't know if AM radio picks it up, but they're saying, Hail Satan.
[02:09:31.294 --> 02:09:35.898]  And the news confirmed, that's what they're saying.
[02:09:35.898 --> 02:09:37.760]  There she is, Hail Satan, sticks her tongue out.
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:42.123]  You gotta repent, sir, for murdering babies.
[02:09:42.123 --> 02:09:42.824]  Why?
[02:09:42.824 --> 02:09:44.385]  Because it's a sin before God.
[02:09:44.385 --> 02:09:44.806]  Why?
[02:09:44.806 --> 02:09:46.727]  Stinky breath.
[02:09:46.727 --> 02:09:48.849]  Yeah, it's pretty evil of you, sir.
[02:09:48.849 --> 02:09:49.449]  Yeah, I am.
[02:09:49.449 --> 02:09:50.590]  And I hope and pray that you...
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:54.481]  Well, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[02:09:54.481 --> 02:09:55.962]  Yeah, I love it!
[02:09:55.962 --> 02:09:56.502]  You love it, huh?
[02:09:56.502 --> 02:09:57.123]  Yeah, I do.
[02:09:57.123 --> 02:09:59.544]  Okay, I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[02:09:59.544 --> 02:10:01.045]  Oh, I'd never go to Christ.
[02:10:01.045 --> 02:10:02.146]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[02:10:02.146 --> 02:10:03.207]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[02:10:03.207 --> 02:10:04.848]  Yeah, you... I don't listen to Christ.
[02:10:04.848 --> 02:10:06.129]  You will have a darkened heart, sir.
[02:10:06.129 --> 02:10:07.890]  I do have a darkened heart, yeah.
[02:10:07.890 --> 02:10:08.711]  You have a darkened heart.
[02:10:08.711 --> 02:10:10.132]  I do, I do, very, very much so.
[02:10:10.132 --> 02:10:12.173]  And you will stand before God in judgment day?
[02:10:12.173 --> 02:10:13.694]  Yes, I will, every day.
[02:10:13.694 --> 02:10:15.255]  You will stand before God in judgment day?
[02:10:15.255 --> 02:10:16.416]  Yes, I will, every day.
[02:10:16.416 --> 02:10:17.837]  All of the babies that you have killed.
[02:10:17.837 --> 02:10:18.658]  I love it, I love it.
[02:10:18.658 --> 02:10:19.899]  Yeah, keep tearing the babies apart.
[02:10:19.899 --> 02:10:20.539]  Yeah, I will.
[02:10:20.539 --> 02:10:21.480]  Keep tearing the babies apart.
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:21.680]  I will.
[02:10:22.785 --> 02:10:24.187]  The truth!
[02:10:24.187 --> 02:10:25.669]  I hate the truth!
[02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:27.851]  I hate the truth!
[02:10:27.851 --> 02:10:33.418]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're not pointing fingers at these kids.
[02:10:33.418 --> 02:10:34.759]  I hate the truth!
[02:10:34.759 --> 02:10:35.881]  I hate the truth!
[02:10:35.881 --> 02:10:39.505]  These aren't we or the men!
[02:10:39.505 --> 02:10:41.267]  We dropped the ball!
[02:10:44.786 --> 02:10:48.187]  Fertilized egg is a human being!
[02:10:48.187 --> 02:10:49.108]  Yeah.
[02:10:49.108 --> 02:10:51.409]  Fertilized egg is a human being!
[02:10:51.409 --> 02:10:52.469]  You're a pig.
[02:10:52.469 --> 02:10:56.191]  Because I don't want to kill babies.
[02:10:56.191 --> 02:10:57.051]  Oh, you kill them.
[02:10:57.051 --> 02:10:59.272]  You let them live so they can starve to death.
[02:10:59.272 --> 02:11:00.713]  Why'd you spit at us?
[02:11:02.282 --> 02:11:04.163]  I, uh, don't agree with you.
[02:11:04.163 --> 02:11:07.044]  No uterus, no right to talk about it.
[02:11:07.044 --> 02:11:08.685]  Understand me, motherf***er?
[02:11:08.685 --> 02:11:10.265]  So when do we cut off abortions?
[02:11:10.265 --> 02:11:11.346]  At what week?
[02:11:11.346 --> 02:11:13.847]  I think at three years old is when we should.
[02:11:13.847 --> 02:11:18.268]  I also had my first abortion at the Seattle Planned Parenthood.
[02:11:18.268 --> 02:11:19.929]  Yay!
[02:11:19.929 --> 02:11:22.050]  I had an abortion!
[02:11:22.050 --> 02:11:22.110]  Woo!
[02:11:26.730 --> 02:11:33.596]  On the topic, on the fetal tissue side of it, you know, it'd be helpful for us to understand volume-wise.
[02:11:33.596 --> 02:11:38.781]  I mean, realistically, if we were to do an agreement with you guys, you know, what do we think you could get?
[02:11:38.781 --> 02:11:40.122]  I mean, what do you feel like you could get?
[02:11:40.122 --> 02:11:40.802]  Volume-wise?
[02:11:40.802 --> 02:11:45.647]  Yeah, on specifically liver tissue, because that's such an area of demand for us.
[02:11:45.647 --> 02:11:48.589]  Right, so liver and what about intact?
[02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:57.053]  Oh yeah, I mean if you had intact cases, which we've done a lot, we've sometimes shipped those back to our lab and it's a tirade.
[02:11:57.053 --> 02:12:00.535]  You know, you can imagine where they would run with this, like, they're selling brown bread, you know.
[02:12:00.535 --> 02:12:04.336]  So I say, okay, what are you looking to supply today?
[02:12:04.336 --> 02:12:07.378]  We were asked to procure certain tissues, like
[02:12:08.258 --> 02:12:16.025]  Brain, liver, thymus, pancreas, heart, lungs, skin, pretty much anything on the venous.
[02:12:16.025 --> 02:12:28.215]  If we alter our process, and we are able to obtain intact fetal cadavers, it's all just a matter of line items.
[02:12:28.215 --> 02:12:29.616]  Tell the lab it's coming.
[02:12:29.616 --> 02:12:30.357]  It'll open the box.
[02:12:30.357 --> 02:12:30.777]  Sign up.
[02:12:32.176 --> 02:12:37.017]  And are we agreed that $100 would keep you happy?
[02:12:37.017 --> 02:12:51.680]  In the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother, just prior to the birth of the baby.
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:58.381]  Now, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but it's not okay with me.
[02:12:58.601 --> 02:13:06.107]  Well, that is not what happens in these cases and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.
[02:13:06.107 --> 02:13:14.373]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lit up the One World Trade Center's spire in pink to celebrate his radical expansion of abortion in New York.
[02:13:14.373 --> 02:13:22.579]  State lawmakers approved a law permitting abortion in the state for any reason until the 24th week of pregnancy and then up until birth.
[02:13:22.799 --> 02:13:26.461]  If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[02:13:26.461 --> 02:13:28.523]  The infant would be delivered.
[02:13:28.523 --> 02:13:30.944]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[02:13:30.944 --> 02:13:36.047]  The infant would be resuscitated, if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[02:13:36.047 --> 02:13:42.411]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[02:13:42.411 --> 02:13:45.433]  Are you for third trimester abortions?
[02:13:45.433 --> 02:13:48.955]  My answer to you is that that should be a decision that the woman makes.
[02:13:51.533 --> 02:13:56.875]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[02:13:56.875 --> 02:13:58.675]  Is it okay to still have children?
[02:13:58.675 --> 02:14:06.097]  How do you justify the decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free?
[02:14:06.097 --> 02:14:06.617]  That's your time.
[02:14:06.617 --> 02:14:07.258]  Next speaker.
[02:14:07.258 --> 02:14:14.720]  There's a new video out on InfoWars.com of two partial birth abortion, eight and a half month old babies.
[02:14:16.275 --> 02:14:18.656]  And, uh, and it makes you want to kill people.
[02:14:18.656 --> 02:14:21.897]  I'm gonna just be honest with you right now.
[02:14:21.897 --> 02:14:30.340]  My guts, my spirit sees a baby who got killed and its brain sucked out by some asshole, and then they make a joke out of it.
[02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:36.261]  These are abortion doctors with third trimester babies that were about to be born.
[02:14:36.261 --> 02:14:39.643]  Defiling them, making jokes about them that they're having a fight.
[02:14:39.643 --> 02:14:43.544]  They're playing with dead babies in a little, um,
[02:14:44.326 --> 02:14:45.747]  Don't knock it till you try it.
[02:14:45.747 --> 02:14:47.308]  And when you do try it, really knock it.
[02:14:47.308 --> 02:14:48.909]  You know, you gotta get that baby out of there.
[02:15:13.715 --> 02:15:14.696]  What a sick demon.
[02:15:14.696 --> 02:15:15.576]  We'll come back from break.
[02:15:15.576 --> 02:15:20.179]  Reverend Childress will have the floor to break down the history of this, why they're coming out in the open.
[02:15:20.179 --> 02:15:24.843]  And I've got stuff even worse that we didn't even put in that because of time.
[02:15:24.843 --> 02:15:31.627]  We've got them saying it's sexually pleasurable and they get pregnant on purpose so they can kill babies.
[02:15:31.627 --> 02:15:33.469]  Well, you saw some of them say that.
[02:15:33.469 --> 02:15:34.870]  And then they tell you, I love Satan.
[02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:36.751]  And they're not joking around, folks.
[02:15:36.751 --> 02:15:38.472]  Devil's real.
[02:15:38.472 --> 02:15:40.954]  And I'm asking, what are we going to do about this?
[02:15:41.732 --> 02:15:46.684]  We'll be right back with Reverend Childress of blackgenocide.org to break down what's really going on.
[02:15:46.684 --> 02:15:47.166]  Stay with us.
[02:15:53.706 --> 02:16:04.896]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:16:04.896 --> 02:16:11.783]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[02:16:12.003 --> 02:16:12.443]  I don't know.
[02:16:35.049 --> 02:16:35.830]  I don't think so.
[02:16:54.525 --> 02:16:58.447]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:58.447 --> 02:16:59.988]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:59.988 --> 02:17:02.950]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:08.513]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:08.513 --> 02:17:09.714]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:09.714 --> 02:17:12.635]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[02:17:55.120 --> 02:18:00.863]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[02:18:00.863 --> 02:18:05.605]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over-the-counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[02:18:05.605 --> 02:18:08.106]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it.
[02:18:08.106 --> 02:18:10.447]  In the last two years, it's been a bestseller.
[02:18:10.447 --> 02:18:22.012]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[02:18:22.472 --> 02:18:32.124]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[02:18:32.124 --> 02:18:37.371]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[02:18:37.611 --> 02:18:41.817]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[02:18:41.817 --> 02:18:45.562]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:18:54.847 --> 02:19:02.274]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you, the products that InfoWarsLife.com are.
[02:19:02.274 --> 02:19:15.567]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[02:19:16.067 --> 02:19:22.711]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[02:19:22.711 --> 02:19:24.492]  It sells itself.
[02:19:24.492 --> 02:19:32.517]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[02:19:33.377 --> 02:19:35.118]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[02:19:35.118 --> 02:19:47.485]  Well, BODY'S Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[02:19:47.485 --> 02:19:50.827]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[02:19:50.827 --> 02:19:57.651]  50% off on BODY'S at Infowarslife.com.
[02:19:57.651 --> 02:20:00.292]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:11.698 --> 02:20:22.828]  I'm not going to go over Reverend Schilder's whole bio, his books, his 700 club appearances, his moves to produce films and show them to people in Congress and really convict the heart of people to understand what's going on.
[02:20:22.828 --> 02:20:25.530]  Killing babies even after they're born now, not just the partial birth.
[02:20:25.530 --> 02:20:26.752]  It's unbelievably evil.
[02:20:26.752 --> 02:20:28.093]  Black genocide out of ORG.
[02:20:28.093 --> 02:20:28.913]  But I wanted to get him on.
[02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:40.738]  Because there's been this coming out now, where you just saw him on Comedy Central and Netflix saying, we love to kill babies, they are babies, and things so sick I can't even say them on air.
[02:20:40.738 --> 02:20:43.460]  And the pedophilia, just all of it rushing outward.
[02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:45.921]  What does Reverend Childress think about this?
[02:20:45.921 --> 02:20:57.290]  And then all these calls that Trump's a racist, and just, you know, his view on that when Trump's marching with the pro-life groups, and we all know it kills more people in this country than anything else.
[02:20:58.490 --> 02:21:00.952]  It's it's it's abortions and particularly for black folks.
[02:21:00.952 --> 02:21:03.093]  So we're talking about facts here with Reverend Shoulders.
[02:21:03.093 --> 02:21:04.674]  Reverend, you've got the floor of the next two segments.
[02:21:04.674 --> 02:21:05.514]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:21:05.514 --> 02:21:06.795]  Thanks for holding while I played that.
[02:21:06.795 --> 02:21:11.778]  I know you were pretty shocked watching and I was watching your face, but we've got even more sickening stuff.
[02:21:11.778 --> 02:21:15.080]  What is your take on what you just saw?
[02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:23.685]  You know, America, you know, the line has really been drawn in the sand without question, conscious wise, politically wise.
[02:21:24.372 --> 02:21:39.339]  You understand when Jill Stanek brought out the fact that these babies were being born alive and confronted Barack Obama basically single-handedly, it was somewhat in stealth, it was somewhat undercover.
[02:21:39.339 --> 02:21:42.461]  That was 2007-2008.
[02:21:42.461 --> 02:21:48.984]  Now you're hearing Ralph Northam, a sitting governor, Andrew Cuomo, a sitting governor,
[02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:55.563]  Blatantly and profoundly just saying, this is what we're going to do.
[02:21:55.563 --> 02:21:57.203]  This is what we do.
[02:21:57.203 --> 02:22:00.605]  And this is something that's good for America.
[02:22:00.605 --> 02:22:11.629]  And so we are we have seen the growth of infanticide to the degree where they wanted it to be a part of your conscience and acceptance.
[02:22:11.629 --> 02:22:15.831]  And Ralph Northam was chilling enough.
[02:22:15.831 --> 02:22:18.472]  And by the way, I think they've overplayed it.
[02:22:19.835 --> 02:22:26.857]  Right now, I think the last poll basically says 60% of people do want restrictions.
[02:22:26.857 --> 02:22:37.180]  And we can thank Ralph Northam and Andrew Cuomo for blatantly saying what they were espousing, what they generally want to bring into America wholesale.
[02:22:37.820 --> 02:22:40.643]  Now, there is a political strategy of that.
[02:22:40.643 --> 02:23:03.722]  They sense that the people's consciences, unquestionably, are to the point where this will go back to the states one day, but now they're just on a wild marketing scheme to basically neutralize any damage that has been done and really make abortion a part of the equation when it comes to
[02:23:04.784 --> 02:23:10.925]  To a pregnancy in the in the conscious, in the heart, in the minds of the people.
[02:23:10.925 --> 02:23:24.048]  That was one of the most moving montages I've seen, basically, and really depicting the state of the present Democratic Party.
[02:23:24.048 --> 02:23:27.388]  For the first time, you have 24 candidates.
[02:23:27.388 --> 02:23:28.449]  I don't know what it's down to.
[02:23:28.449 --> 02:23:30.209]  Maybe down to a little less right now.
[02:23:31.028 --> 02:23:35.734]  America, you have 24 candidates espousing infanticide.
[02:23:35.734 --> 02:23:43.843]  You probably have the most pro-life president of America's history, or since Roe vs. Wade.
[02:23:43.843 --> 02:23:50.952]  I mean, the clash is just tremendous right now, and choose you this day whom you will serve.
[02:23:51.958 --> 02:23:54.061]  And I love that piece you played.
[02:23:54.061 --> 02:23:55.582]  And I remember that debate.
[02:23:55.582 --> 02:23:59.807]  And Donald Trump, you know, very simply said, that's not all right with me.
[02:23:59.807 --> 02:24:02.971]  That shouldn't be all right with any American.
[02:24:02.971 --> 02:24:03.852]  But I want to say.
[02:24:04.736 --> 02:24:17.564]  I have to thank Ralph Northam and I have to thank Andrew Cuomo because many people who have been able to put this on the back burner are now realizing what really is going on in these clinics.
[02:24:17.564 --> 02:24:26.389]  That this right now, America is a country that sacrifices babies to MOLAC, is engaged in child sacrifice.
[02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:30.992]  And I really think they're going to pay for it in November 2020.
[02:24:30.992 --> 02:24:32.793]  I'm looking at some of the demographics.
[02:24:32.793 --> 02:24:34.174]  I'm looking at some of the data.
[02:24:34.881 --> 02:24:48.850]  I think right now, really for the first time in a long time, the issue of abortion really will come center stage because of their insistence on infanticide.
[02:24:48.850 --> 02:24:53.373]  And I also want to say this to all your African American listeners.
[02:24:53.373 --> 02:25:00.658]  Martin Luther King is the probably the most identifiable iconic figure when it comes to civil rights.
[02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:04.320]  In his letter from the Birmingham jail, Martin said,
[02:25:05.350 --> 02:25:08.613]  Infanticide was evil.
[02:25:08.613 --> 02:25:11.775]  Dr. King said that, and he was talking to the church.
[02:25:11.775 --> 02:25:32.611]  He said the early church put away such evils as gladiatorial contest, that's another story, and infanticide, where at the demise of Rome they actually had a law that you can place a child by the side of the road to die if you did not like the child's hair color, skin color, whatever the reason.
[02:25:32.611 --> 02:25:32.931]  You were
[02:25:33.749 --> 02:25:36.911]  Basically able to put the child by the side of the road to die.
[02:25:36.911 --> 02:25:45.877]  But the early church scooped those children up and raised them at the threat of death each day of their lives, therefore.
[02:25:45.877 --> 02:25:59.066]  So, no question, I say to the African American audience and so many that hold his life and his teachings dear, how can you pull the lever on infanticide?
[02:25:59.066 --> 02:26:02.028]  They are literally, it's satanic, it's demonic.
[02:26:02.668 --> 02:26:03.689]  Well, that was not his question.
[02:26:03.689 --> 02:26:05.050]  You went to the history.
[02:26:05.050 --> 02:26:14.616]  Every culture, before it collapses, whether it was the ancient Europe, whether it was in Asia, Africa, Latin America did it, back when it was Mesoamerica, people start sacrificing children.
[02:26:14.616 --> 02:26:17.738]  It's Satan.
[02:26:17.738 --> 02:26:20.460]  There's a hunger, a spiritual drive that wants to do this.
[02:26:20.460 --> 02:26:21.581]  Why?
[02:26:21.581 --> 02:26:23.962]  You really can't describe it any other way.
[02:26:23.962 --> 02:26:31.908]  First, you're destroying images or persons that are made in God's image, but from almost, from just outside the garden.
[02:26:32.543 --> 02:26:36.686]  Satan has demanded a blood sacrifice to him.
[02:26:36.686 --> 02:26:40.929]  It increases their power, their status.
[02:26:40.929 --> 02:26:47.233]  I don't want to get into all those spiritual things here, but trust me, look at history.
[02:26:47.233 --> 02:26:56.580]  Evil always morphs its way into each society to sacrifice or to mutilate or to kill
[02:26:57.432 --> 02:26:59.395]  Innocence, or the children in the womb.
[02:26:59.395 --> 02:27:05.785]  That's the cost of admission to Satan who still has dominion over the earth, the power of the principalities of the air.
[02:27:05.785 --> 02:27:07.387]  I mean, that's the entry card.
[02:27:07.387 --> 02:27:09.711]  That's the admission fee is torturing little babies.
[02:27:10.715 --> 02:27:16.840]  And that's how the church could ever be opposing the agenda of Donald Trump.
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:21.223]  How the church could ever be talking about his decorum.
[02:27:21.223 --> 02:27:25.627]  This man is really trying to put an end to Baphomet, as you depict there.
[02:27:25.627 --> 02:27:28.389]  He's trying to put an end to the child's sacrifice.
[02:27:29.229 --> 02:27:33.272]  And America is going to, it is America's most egregious sin.
[02:27:33.272 --> 02:27:34.732]  You just said it.
[02:27:34.732 --> 02:27:36.513]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:27:36.513 --> 02:27:42.817]  God rose up all, you know, kings, corrupt kings, good kings, middle of the road, King David, did bad things, God forgave him.
[02:27:42.817 --> 02:27:43.377]  Doesn't matter.
[02:27:43.377 --> 02:27:45.659]  Trump clearly has the devil mad at him.
[02:27:45.659 --> 02:27:47.820]  I mean, Trump's got the whole world going crazy.
[02:27:48.937 --> 02:27:49.698]  Absolutely.
[02:27:49.698 --> 02:27:52.460]  He's God's man for this time.
[02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:54.762]  He is prophetic.
[02:27:54.762 --> 02:27:56.603]  He's our Cyrus, so to speak.
[02:27:56.603 --> 02:28:02.308]  He is going to make the attempt to restore America back to its virtue.
[02:28:02.308 --> 02:28:05.050]  And one of the things he's clear about, if anything,
[02:28:05.690 --> 02:28:09.513]  And the social strata of things is abortion.
[02:28:09.513 --> 02:28:11.254]  He's been the clearest.
[02:28:11.254 --> 02:28:18.380]  I believe that it soon will happen, that the child sacrifice will go back to the states probably.
[02:28:18.380 --> 02:28:26.025]  But just for the government to make a stand to diminish or do away with Roe vs. Wade would unquestionably hurt
[02:28:27.206 --> 02:28:35.728]  That's one level, as you know.
[02:28:35.728 --> 02:28:36.448]  It's a sacrament.
[02:28:36.448 --> 02:28:37.869]  You always get into the history, and that's great.
[02:28:37.869 --> 02:28:38.369]  You're an expert.
[02:28:38.369 --> 02:28:39.009]  That's what we have you on.
[02:28:39.009 --> 02:28:40.109]  You know more than I do.
[02:28:40.109 --> 02:28:41.350]  But we should probably get into the spiritual.
[02:28:41.350 --> 02:28:43.830]  We've never really done that here, because that's what's behind all this.
[02:28:43.830 --> 02:28:44.851]  Reverend Childress, we'll be right back.
[02:28:44.851 --> 02:28:46.091]  Thanks for being with us, my friend.
[02:28:46.091 --> 02:28:48.932]  Be sure to visit the site, blackgenocide.org, and share that link.
[02:28:48.932 --> 02:28:50.092]  If you don't, who will?
[02:28:53.775 --> 02:29:04.958]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:04.958 --> 02:29:14.261]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:29:14.261 --> 02:29:19.342]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[02:29:19.542 --> 02:29:23.766]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location.
[02:29:23.766 --> 02:29:31.734]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[02:29:31.734 --> 02:29:32.995]  So here's what you should do right now.
[02:29:32.995 --> 02:29:34.977]  Check out the PPX Microgrid System
[02:29:35.137 --> 02:29:35.718]  That's right.
[02:29:55.054 --> 02:30:02.462]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you, the products at Infowarslife.com are.
[02:30:02.462 --> 02:30:15.758]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[02:30:16.258 --> 02:30:22.926]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[02:30:22.926 --> 02:30:24.688]  It sells itself.
[02:30:24.688 --> 02:30:33.619]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[02:30:33.619 --> 02:30:34.801]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[02:30:36.062 --> 02:30:47.691]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[02:30:47.691 --> 02:30:50.613]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[02:30:50.613 --> 02:30:52.834]  50% off on Body's at Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:54.531 --> 02:31:00.276]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[02:31:00.276 --> 02:31:05.000]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over-the-counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.683]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it.
[02:31:07.683 --> 02:31:09.845]  In the last two years, it's been a bestseller.
[02:31:09.845 --> 02:31:21.415]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[02:31:21.855 --> 02:31:31.525]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[02:31:31.525 --> 02:31:36.771]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one.
[02:31:37.031 --> 02:31:44.956]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price, and it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:44.956 --> 02:31:47.957]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[02:31:47.957 --> 02:31:54.341]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as I'm taping this September 10th.
[02:31:54.341 --> 02:32:01.805]  As I sit here recording this on the eve of September 11th, 2019, and I look back to that tragic event 18 years ago,
[02:32:03.809 --> 02:32:17.855]  It makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and have the Fire Department of New York and major construction and engineering firms come out and confirm that bombs were in Tower 1, Tower 2, and of course Building 7.
[02:32:17.855 --> 02:32:20.016]  It's just pancakes.
[02:32:20.016 --> 02:32:27.679]  And that then FBI Director Robert Mueller helped cover the whole thing up with the Saudis and to know that there's a deep state group
[02:32:28.439 --> 02:32:40.227]  Working within our government with radical Islam who are using the threat of Islamic terror to take our basic liberties and freedoms while empowering and funding radical Islam to take over the planet.
[02:32:40.227 --> 02:32:49.853]  Well, 18 years later, I'm here to tell you that the world is awake at 9-11 and InfoWars and our researchers and our guests, our whistleblowers, have been vindicated yet again.
[02:32:49.853 --> 02:32:52.055]  That's why InfoWars.com is more important than ever.
[02:32:57.563 --> 02:33:16.458]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.458 --> 02:33:23.044]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:34.304 --> 02:33:46.118]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to invite Reverend Childress back on the roll room with Owen Schroer, back on the firepower of Will Johnson, back home with David Knight because, you know, years go by like seconds now and we probably only have this gentleman on like
[02:33:46.118 --> 02:33:46.358]  I think?
[02:34:16.883 --> 02:34:19.764]  And we're being taught it's a post-human world and to hate ourselves.
[02:34:19.764 --> 02:34:24.186]  And the left is in WikiLeaks trying to create racial division and cultural division.
[02:34:24.186 --> 02:34:26.648]  This is all to bring us down.
[02:34:26.648 --> 02:34:30.309]  And so there couldn't be a more important topic to cover and discuss here.
[02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:36.572]  Getting into what you think is most important to impart to the listeners.
[02:34:36.572 --> 02:34:37.932]  This is a great audience.
[02:34:37.932 --> 02:34:38.793]  They're the salt of the earth.
[02:34:38.793 --> 02:34:43.436]  I think the biggest message is they need to reach out to others to get them to understand what's happening.
[02:34:43.436 --> 02:34:44.536]  They need to share this interview.
[02:34:44.536 --> 02:34:47.498]  They need to share that report we just showed earlier that's so powerful.
[02:34:47.498 --> 02:34:48.678]  We need to expose this.
[02:34:48.678 --> 02:34:53.361]  Sure, it's more fun to go watch a football game or go to the movies, but you know what?
[02:34:53.361 --> 02:34:55.983]  I don't want to say I feel guilty, but I do.
[02:34:57.319 --> 02:34:58.840]  I know they're keeping babies alive.
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:02.323]  I know what hospitals to wait while the orders come in for their organs.
[02:35:02.323 --> 02:35:04.585]  And then I feel bad that I'm not protesting outside.
[02:35:04.585 --> 02:35:08.829]  I mean, I'm doing it on air, but we need to have our heart convicted to really do something.
[02:35:08.829 --> 02:35:13.253]  Because if we don't stand up for them, none of our lives are going to be protected as well.
[02:35:13.253 --> 02:35:14.434]  Where is the empathy?
[02:35:14.434 --> 02:35:20.499]  Where is the common sense that if this can happen to babies, and they can be euthanizing old people, none of us are safe?
[02:35:21.812 --> 02:35:22.413]  None.
[02:35:22.413 --> 02:35:25.277]  And this is what I'm talking about spiritually.
[02:35:25.277 --> 02:35:27.880]  The line right now is drawn in the sand.
[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:28.341]  America.
[02:35:28.974 --> 02:35:33.315]  And no question, we can never say that we did not know.
[02:35:33.315 --> 02:35:37.636]  Our elected officials have told you what they're doing.
[02:35:37.636 --> 02:35:46.958]  Through the efforts of David D. Lyon and others, Mr. O'Keefe, we know they're selling body parts.
[02:35:46.958 --> 02:35:49.379]  We know they're in it for a business.
[02:35:49.379 --> 02:35:50.979]  We know it's lucrative.
[02:35:50.979 --> 02:35:57.661]  We know now it is Moloch, unquestionably manifested here in the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[02:35:58.308 --> 02:36:11.288]  And so with whenever sin is exposed like this, before it was, we knew about it, but it wasn't on the, you know, it wasn't as blatant, it wasn't as public, and it's basically now documented.
[02:36:12.029 --> 02:36:16.432]  And so we have the attacks on those who will carry the message.
[02:36:16.432 --> 02:36:19.674]  They have attacks on InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[02:36:19.674 --> 02:36:28.561]  Even my website and my name now is basically being censored from the information that we've been carrying.
[02:36:28.561 --> 02:36:31.703]  And so no doubt we're at the crossroads.
[02:36:31.703 --> 02:36:33.784]  The line is drawn in the sand.
[02:36:33.784 --> 02:36:37.787]  And America, I appeal to America, the killing must stop.
[02:36:38.405 --> 02:36:40.807]  The killing of the innocent must stop.
[02:36:40.807 --> 02:36:44.010]  The sacrifice of babies to Moloch must stop.
[02:36:44.010 --> 02:36:49.876]  One of the things they would do when they were sacrificing babies, the drummers
[02:36:50.752 --> 02:36:55.173]  Would beat the drums so loud that you could not hear the child scream.
[02:36:55.173 --> 02:36:59.815]  So in other words, they were trying to desensitize conscience.
[02:36:59.815 --> 02:37:02.576]  That's exactly what's going on right now.
[02:37:02.576 --> 02:37:03.416]  You mentioned it.
[02:37:03.416 --> 02:37:06.697]  They're trying to say to us, this is okay.
[02:37:06.697 --> 02:37:08.397]  This should be a part of life.
[02:37:08.397 --> 02:37:12.699]  This should be a decision that a woman makes on about her own body.
[02:37:12.699 --> 02:37:13.819]  Of course, I've always said.
[02:37:14.642 --> 02:37:21.555]  It's intellectually dishonest to claim a right for yourself and in so doing take taking away the right of someone else.
[02:37:21.555 --> 02:37:25.022]  But right now they're backed up against the corner.
[02:37:25.022 --> 02:37:27.126]  If I might may want to interject also.
[02:37:28.138 --> 02:37:32.419]  And you've already stated, we are winning the battle of the debate.
[02:37:32.419 --> 02:37:47.023]  And so they are even more determined to destroy this president and destroy his agenda, destroy anything that reflects his agenda, meaning especially the pro-life message.
[02:37:47.023 --> 02:37:55.565]  Now recently, and you do this probably better than anybody, but you've got to understand they have about a year to turn these numbers around.
[02:37:56.252 --> 02:37:58.594]  So I'm expecting race wars.
[02:37:58.594 --> 02:38:05.481]  I'm expecting any type of scheme or scam to destroy this president.
[02:38:05.481 --> 02:38:08.304]  He won with 8% of the black vote.
[02:38:08.304 --> 02:38:09.405]  He won.
[02:38:09.405 --> 02:38:13.989]  Right now, the lowest numbers I'm hearing, he's at 24%.
[02:38:13.989 --> 02:38:17.152]  The Hispanic vote, he won, I think, with 29%.
[02:38:17.152 --> 02:38:18.573]  Well, now he's winning with 49% to 52%.
[02:38:21.278 --> 02:38:30.741]  They may not be saying anything, but their strategists know landslide next year if these numbers stay the same.
[02:38:30.741 --> 02:38:35.442]  I thank God he's held true to his word in his agenda.
[02:38:35.442 --> 02:38:41.004]  He's not a perfect man, and perhaps he wishes he would have done some other things better.
[02:38:41.004 --> 02:38:43.645]  But I'm telling you, I'm telling your audience,
[02:38:45.866 --> 02:38:51.868]  If a race war, a race attack, or something that revolves around race, because that's the only card they get.
[02:38:51.868 --> 02:39:01.213]  Well, you know, they're winding up Antifa to go out and stage attacks on minorities, and then they cover up their social pages admitting they were Antifa, doing it to get our guns.
[02:39:01.213 --> 02:39:04.174]  And then, in every case, they're actually Satanists!
[02:39:04.174 --> 02:39:08.736]  The guy in Texas and the guy in Ohio were both Satanists, and then they tried to cover it up!
[02:39:09.867 --> 02:39:31.239]  Satan has done everything he can, and always, no matter what tragedy goes around, no doubt, no question about it, in every society, when you have legalized killing of the innocent, when the sanctity of life has been basically denounced or denied its place in the consciousness of that government...
[02:39:33.070 --> 02:39:33.470]  Yes.
[02:39:33.470 --> 02:39:34.711]  You're going to have upheavals.
[02:39:34.711 --> 02:39:38.172]  You're going to have man's inhumanity to the man.
[02:39:38.172 --> 02:39:41.534]  But I just want to say to your audience, keep pressing.
[02:39:41.534 --> 02:39:44.535]  Be out in the public as much as you can.
[02:39:44.535 --> 02:39:47.336]  Right now, they're up against the ropes.
[02:39:47.336 --> 02:39:49.517]  I believe we're going to get a knockout punch soon.
[02:39:50.197 --> 02:40:03.107]  But it's going to appear, just as the montage you played, which was excellent, it's going to make you to believe, since these persons condone this, you should too.
[02:40:03.107 --> 02:40:14.916]  Well exactly, they're flaunting it like it's no big deal, the most extreme, yeah we love to kill babies for fun, yeah they are babies, hoping that just desensitizes us instead of the other, or hoping it demoralizes us, but let me raise this point since you get into that.
[02:40:17.253 --> 02:40:21.694]  They admit, and they are pushing, and so we should talk about the numbers.
[02:40:21.694 --> 02:40:22.514]  How many abortions?
[02:40:22.514 --> 02:40:29.376]  I know a bunch of states don't report it, but the best numbers we have, how many people have been aborted since Roe v. Wade, and how many of them were black?
[02:40:29.376 --> 02:40:35.038]  Because that just neutralizes all the lies, you know, that Trump's a white supremacist, and all this ridiculous crap.
[02:40:35.038 --> 02:40:36.978]  When the real litmus test is, are you for abortion or not?
[02:40:36.978 --> 02:40:40.099]  That's the Planned Parenthood, the real proto-Nazis.
[02:40:40.099 --> 02:40:42.700]  That's what the Nazis, as you know and have written about, got the idea.
[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:49.704]  I'm talking about real numbers here, when you know they're going to stage some deal shooting a black church up the week before the election.
[02:40:49.704 --> 02:40:51.965]  I mean, and the guys we have, Trump supporters, we all know.
[02:40:51.965 --> 02:40:54.007]  So okay, 24 black people get killed.
[02:40:54.007 --> 02:40:55.848]  What about 10 million black babies, you see?
[02:40:55.848 --> 02:40:59.650]  So we need to get that out in people's minds.
[02:40:59.650 --> 02:41:00.131]  It's 21 million.
[02:41:02.075 --> 02:41:10.381]  21 million African-Americans since Roe vs. Wade and I look at everybody's numbers and that is that is a moderate.
[02:41:10.381 --> 02:41:11.482]  And what's the total?
[02:41:11.482 --> 02:41:13.143]  Is it 60 million people total?
[02:41:13.143 --> 02:41:14.824]  Yeah, just over 60 now.
[02:41:14.824 --> 02:41:17.546]  Just recently, just over 60 million.
[02:41:17.546 --> 02:41:26.113]  And so you have African-Americans at 12.4% of the population having 36% of the abortions.
[02:41:26.113 --> 02:41:29.255]  52% of all African-American pregnancies end in abortions.
[02:41:29.255 --> 02:41:30.136]  That's their numbers.
[02:41:30.136 --> 02:41:30.737]  That's not
[02:41:31.337 --> 02:41:33.158]  A few researchers, some Christian group.
[02:41:33.158 --> 02:41:39.920]  So with the globalist stage blowing up the black church or something, we're very sad, but that's 20 people, not 22 million.
[02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:40.840]  Absolutely.
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:42.321]  You mention it all the time.
[02:41:42.321 --> 02:41:48.523]  Where's the attention on Chicago, Philadelphia, where and daily, every weekend.
[02:41:48.523 --> 02:41:51.824]  You know, sometimes I'm stunned to hear these numbers on a weekend.
[02:41:51.824 --> 02:41:52.564]  Thousands of deaths a year.
[02:41:53.644 --> 02:41:57.726]  And I'm saying to myself, where is our leaders?
[02:41:57.726 --> 02:41:59.647]  Where is the march on Chicago?
[02:41:59.647 --> 02:42:12.794]  Where is the march on Philly for the violence, the black-on-black crime and violence that is unquestionably just really destroying the culture of African Americans and the mindset of our young people?
[02:42:13.154 --> 02:42:14.996]  And any racial attacks are terrible.
[02:42:14.996 --> 02:42:20.403]  What I'm saying is they're going to distract us from their main operation by provocateuring and staging events they've been caught.
[02:42:20.403 --> 02:42:21.565]  Reverend Shoulders, thank you for the time.
[02:42:21.565 --> 02:42:22.046]  God bless you.
[02:42:22.046 --> 02:42:23.668]  BlackGenocide.org.
[02:42:23.668 --> 02:42:26.591]  Please come join us for a full hour and take calls very soon.
[02:42:26.591 --> 02:42:27.453]  And please come on the other shows.
[02:42:28.502 --> 02:42:29.323]  Not a problem.
[02:42:29.323 --> 02:42:30.004]  God bless you.
[02:42:30.004 --> 02:42:30.904]  God bless you.
[02:42:30.904 --> 02:42:32.626]  Alright, when we come back, he just mentioned it.
[02:42:32.626 --> 02:42:34.648]  That's what we're getting to.
[02:42:34.648 --> 02:42:37.991]  They're going to try to cause a civil war with the gun confiscations.
[02:42:37.991 --> 02:42:38.852]  That's their plan.
[02:42:38.852 --> 02:42:40.433]  They know it's going to cause that.
[02:42:40.433 --> 02:42:41.675]  How do we defeat it?
[02:42:41.675 --> 02:42:42.455]  I know how to beat it.
[02:42:42.455 --> 02:42:44.577]  This is serious when we come back.
[02:42:44.577 --> 02:42:47.100]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:42:47.100 --> 02:42:51.624]  But whatever you do, seriously, we can win this fight if you spread the word.
[02:42:51.624 --> 02:42:52.405]  So thank you for doing that.
[02:42:53.942 --> 02:43:01.350]  There are few things in this universe that are sure to bet, but I'm here to tell you, the products that InfoWarsLive.com are.
[02:43:01.350 --> 02:43:14.646]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[02:43:15.146 --> 02:43:21.809]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[02:43:21.809 --> 02:43:23.570]  It sells itself.
[02:43:23.570 --> 02:43:32.494]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[02:43:32.494 --> 02:43:33.675]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[02:43:34.195 --> 02:43:45.683]  Well, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[02:43:45.683 --> 02:43:49.926]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[02:43:49.926 --> 02:43:51.727]  50% off on Body's at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:52.828 --> 02:43:57.072]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third bestseller.
[02:43:57.072 --> 02:44:01.857]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[02:44:01.857 --> 02:44:04.100]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:08.124]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[02:44:08.484 --> 02:44:13.567]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[02:44:13.567 --> 02:44:15.407]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[02:44:15.407 --> 02:44:16.688]  Helps make DNA.
[02:44:16.688 --> 02:44:18.029]  Helps the body produce energy.
[02:44:18.029 --> 02:44:19.510]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:21.531]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[02:44:21.531 --> 02:44:22.331]  It goes on and on.
[02:44:22.331 --> 02:44:30.615]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[02:44:30.615 --> 02:44:33.156]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[02:44:33.156 --> 02:44:34.277]  It helps fund the Infowar.
[02:44:34.837 --> 02:44:39.981]  Plus a 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:39.981 --> 02:44:45.325]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[02:44:45.325 --> 02:44:50.569]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:44:54.634 --> 02:45:03.180]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[02:45:03.180 --> 02:45:07.824]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[02:45:07.824 --> 02:45:14.729]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[02:45:15.209 --> 02:45:39.333]  I was the first to warn you, along with Paul Watson and Infowars.com, 15 years ago, that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do, and hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues, like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy, that our government in Hollywood had been taken over by the Communist Chinese, on every one of these issues and many others.
[02:45:39.793 --> 02:45:43.775]  We've been dead on, and we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale.
[02:45:43.775 --> 02:45:46.337]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[02:45:46.337 --> 02:45:50.379]  And that's why you are more critical than ever to support the Infowar.
[02:45:50.379 --> 02:45:52.701]  Please support the Infowar however you can.
[02:45:54.452 --> 02:46:00.195]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[02:46:00.195 --> 02:46:04.918]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over-the-counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[02:46:04.918 --> 02:46:07.639]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it.
[02:46:07.639 --> 02:46:09.760]  In the last two years, it's been a bestseller.
[02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:21.327]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[02:46:21.787 --> 02:46:31.431]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil, and so much more.
[02:46:31.431 --> 02:46:36.674]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[02:46:36.974 --> 02:46:44.878]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price, and it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:46:44.878 --> 02:46:47.879]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[02:46:47.879 --> 02:46:57.684]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[02:46:57.684 --> 02:47:00.326]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:31.078 --> 02:47:34.081]  Well, my friends, they've thrown down the gauntlet.
[02:47:34.081 --> 02:47:38.925]  All the Democratic candidates say they're going to confiscate 90% of the guns of the U.S.
[02:47:38.925 --> 02:47:43.609]  and they're going to send SWAT teams to kill you if you don't turn them in.
[02:47:43.609 --> 02:47:45.230]  They don't even care if Congress passes it.
[02:47:45.230 --> 02:47:47.352]  They just say they'll have executive orders.
[02:47:47.352 --> 02:47:49.994]  Here's their leader calling it 1% Beto O'Rourke.
[02:47:49.994 --> 02:47:52.296]  Yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[02:47:52.296 --> 02:47:54.718]  We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.
[02:48:03.665 --> 02:48:07.147]  Well, let's get into it right now.
[02:48:07.147 --> 02:48:09.109]  First off, we have to fund this operation.
[02:48:09.109 --> 02:48:17.215]  Then I'm going to tell you, I think you already have it figured out probably better than I do, but I'm going to lay it out for folks that don't know, just exactly what we're facing and how we can stop it.
[02:48:17.215 --> 02:48:22.580]  And when I say how we can stop it, I'm very blessed to be in this position.
[02:48:22.580 --> 02:48:23.701]  I'm not on a power trip.
[02:48:23.701 --> 02:48:24.321]  It's the opposite.
[02:48:24.321 --> 02:48:31.287]  I feel like I have great responsibility constantly and feel like I'm not acting at the level I should be.
[02:48:33.254 --> 02:48:42.096]  Just imagine a bunch of horses pulling a carriage and they're just got snot coming out and they're frothing and they're pulling up that hill just to want to jam their hooves in to get that thing up there.
[02:48:42.096 --> 02:48:43.536]  They're not on a power trip.
[02:48:43.536 --> 02:48:44.816]  They're pulling a heavy load.
[02:48:44.816 --> 02:48:46.637]  They've got a mission and they're committed.
[02:48:46.637 --> 02:48:48.337]  Well, that's that's who I am.
[02:48:48.337 --> 02:48:49.958]  Because I know who these people are.
[02:48:49.958 --> 02:48:52.818]  I've been face to face with them my whole life.
[02:48:52.818 --> 02:48:56.759]  I just ran into weirdness after craziness after bizarreness.
[02:48:58.755 --> 02:49:00.797]  Like that film, Cat's Eye.
[02:49:00.797 --> 02:49:05.941]  The whole movie's about the weird, crazy things this one cat sees.
[02:49:05.941 --> 02:49:07.702]  And it just gets crazier and crazier.
[02:49:07.702 --> 02:49:09.464]  Well, that's kind of been like my life.
[02:49:09.464 --> 02:49:12.246]  It's just the weird, weird stuff I ran into and I saw.
[02:49:12.246 --> 02:49:16.150]  Now I realize it was God training me.
[02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:17.891]  Preparing me.
[02:49:17.891 --> 02:49:20.033]  So that I would really know what was really going on.
[02:49:21.001 --> 02:49:28.227]  Because just one of the crazy things I've seen or done, or that I ran into, most people might have had one of those things in their life.
[02:49:28.227 --> 02:49:29.668]  And I'm not bragging about this, by the way.
[02:49:29.668 --> 02:49:33.231]  A lot of it was very traumatic.
[02:49:33.231 --> 02:49:37.114]  But I'm telling you, we know their plan, and I know how to beat it.
[02:49:37.114 --> 02:49:39.455]  And I think once you hear me talk about this, you're going to agree with me.
[02:49:39.455 --> 02:49:43.198]  In fact, most of you probably already thought this yourselves, because we're on the same page.
[02:49:43.198 --> 02:49:46.321]  We're simpatico.
[02:49:46.321 --> 02:49:49.203]  First off, though, we've got to fund this operation.
[02:49:49.203 --> 02:49:50.004]  I came in this morning.
[02:49:51.676 --> 02:49:58.319]  And I said, hey, everybody, what's a great Beto counter shirt?
[02:49:58.319 --> 02:49:59.479]  Like from our cold dead hands?
[02:49:59.479 --> 02:50:01.600]  I was like, well, how about from his cold dead hands?
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:04.221]  Well, I don't want to threaten him, but that's what's going to happen.
[02:50:04.221 --> 02:50:05.782]  You know, they try to take the guns of civil war.
[02:50:05.782 --> 02:50:12.524]  I mean, how do you do it?
[02:50:12.524 --> 02:50:20.728]  And he's got a shirt out he's selling saying, hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s and all your other semi autos.
[02:50:20.728 --> 02:50:20.928]  Well,
[02:50:22.423 --> 02:50:30.405]  One of my old friends, a guy that did security work for us, he called up this morning and said, we're in the middle of the show, he said, I just came up with this design.
[02:50:30.405 --> 02:50:37.067]  He's friends with Pipefitters Union, one of my veterans here in Central Texas, that does the printing for us.
[02:50:37.067 --> 02:50:39.148]  He said, how about Beto Knot?
[02:50:39.148 --> 02:50:40.768]  Beto Knot.
[02:50:40.768 --> 02:50:41.968]  It's a M4, AR-15.
[02:50:44.580 --> 02:50:47.722]  A Texas star above it, but it's an Army star or whatever you like.
[02:50:47.722 --> 02:50:48.943]  And then Beto Knott.
[02:50:48.943 --> 02:50:50.805]  I want to do one, too, in Army green.
[02:50:50.805 --> 02:50:53.827]  These are being printed, already being printed.
[02:50:53.827 --> 02:50:56.129]  And on the back, oh, they already have it in Army green.
[02:50:56.129 --> 02:50:56.829]  Go down there and click below.
[02:50:56.829 --> 02:50:58.451]  I guess they already did what I said.
[02:50:58.451 --> 02:51:01.493]  On the back, it says Infowars.com.
[02:51:01.493 --> 02:51:03.415]  But click on that green one down there below.
[02:51:03.415 --> 02:51:04.856]  So, we've already got it in gray.
[02:51:04.856 --> 02:51:06.537]  We've already got it in Army green.
[02:51:06.537 --> 02:51:07.618]  We've got it in darker gray.
[02:51:09.327 --> 02:51:11.769]  And this needs to be a bestseller.
[02:51:11.769 --> 02:51:16.353]  Exercise your First Amendment in defense of the second or lose it.
[02:51:16.353 --> 02:51:23.538]  And it's a win-win because you're funding this operation that, again, I just want to reach more people.
[02:51:23.538 --> 02:51:24.439]  That's your word of mouth.
[02:51:24.439 --> 02:51:25.660]  And I just want to fund the operation.
[02:51:25.660 --> 02:51:26.361]  That's your support.
[02:51:26.361 --> 02:51:28.622]  Plus, you get great products you already need.
[02:51:28.622 --> 02:51:29.983]  Take action today.
[02:51:29.983 --> 02:51:33.426]  You know, they came out and were banning the Betsy Ross flag.
[02:51:33.426 --> 02:51:34.127]  We sold 10,000 of them.
[02:51:36.072 --> 02:51:37.053]  And that sounds like a lot of money.
[02:51:37.053 --> 02:51:39.334]  It's not to run this operation, but to put a lot of the shirts on the streets.
[02:51:39.334 --> 02:51:39.734]  That's great.
[02:51:39.734 --> 02:51:40.634]  Thank you.
[02:51:40.634 --> 02:51:43.676]  We sold 7,000 of the Space Force shirt.
[02:51:43.676 --> 02:51:44.396]  That spreads the word.
[02:51:44.396 --> 02:51:48.318]  It's a nice, comfortable, cool shirt and fun.
[02:51:48.318 --> 02:51:52.841]  We sold 100,000 of the Hillary for Prison shirts, but I sold half of it for $5 it cost.
[02:51:52.841 --> 02:51:55.422]  These shirts cost more because they're nicer fabric.
[02:51:55.422 --> 02:51:56.403]  Space Force shirts are like $12.
[02:51:59.266 --> 02:52:01.367]  The XXL is even more.
[02:52:01.367 --> 02:52:05.708]  So, these are designer shirts that'll be $25, $35 in stores.
[02:52:05.708 --> 02:52:07.289]  I just want to move them.
[02:52:07.289 --> 02:52:10.310]  You know, in the old days, we just had the more inexpensive shirts.
[02:52:10.310 --> 02:52:13.011]  They were still well-made, but they weren't as soft as regular cotton.
[02:52:13.011 --> 02:52:15.611]  We still sell those.
[02:52:15.611 --> 02:52:20.873]  But just go to InfoWareStore.com and get some of the apparel today to exercise your free speech in the third dimension.
[02:52:20.873 --> 02:52:22.234]  The cyberspace is so censored.
[02:52:22.234 --> 02:52:23.154]  And spread the word.
[02:52:23.154 --> 02:52:24.654]  And again, I'm not bitching at you.
[02:52:24.654 --> 02:52:26.315]  I'm saying, don't you want to win this thing?
[02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:30.610]  You really want these globalists that are out in the open throwing down the gauntlet?
[02:52:30.610 --> 02:52:31.570]  We're going to take your guns?
[02:52:31.570 --> 02:52:33.010]  Yeah, we're into pedophilia.
[02:52:33.010 --> 02:52:34.311]  Yeah, we kill babies after they're born.
[02:52:34.311 --> 02:52:35.611]  Yeah, we work for the shy-coms.
[02:52:35.611 --> 02:52:38.292]  Yeah, America sucks.
[02:52:38.292 --> 02:52:40.732]  It's not like we're just one of the programs out there fighting them.
[02:52:40.732 --> 02:52:42.373]  We're the one that's got their number.
[02:52:42.373 --> 02:52:45.013]  They don't like our spirit.
[02:52:45.013 --> 02:52:49.934]  Because believe me, it's the opposite of Satanism.
[02:52:49.934 --> 02:52:56.896]  And it may come off as aggressive and a little hateful sometimes because it's, you know, that's the Holy Spirit shining through my dirty earth suit.
[02:52:57.967 --> 02:52:58.548]  And you know what?
[02:52:58.548 --> 02:53:03.512]  The truth is, at least out of the Bible and history, most people God used to go after evil.
[02:53:03.512 --> 02:53:05.073]  We're not a bunch of candy asses.
[02:53:05.073 --> 02:53:09.777]  We're not up there all telling you how holy they were all day long.
[02:53:09.777 --> 02:53:13.440]  So I'm up here to put on some sweetsie act for people.
[02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:16.122]  Because I don't have the energy to do it.
[02:53:16.122 --> 02:53:17.323]  I can't be fake.
[02:53:17.323 --> 02:53:18.224]  I just don't have it in me.
[02:53:19.879 --> 02:53:24.003]  In fact, if anything, I just hold back just how really pissed off I am.
[02:53:24.003 --> 02:53:25.304]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:53:25.304 --> 02:53:28.747]  If you're not angry about what's happening, there's something wrong with you.
[02:53:28.747 --> 02:53:30.288]  And I know you're pissed.
[02:53:30.288 --> 02:53:32.870]  But let's put that anger into action.
[02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:34.071]  Legal, lawful action.
[02:53:34.071 --> 02:53:35.633]  But I'll tell you this.
[02:53:35.633 --> 02:53:38.475]  They know they're losing the information war and the spiritual war.
[02:53:38.475 --> 02:53:39.736]  They're gearing up for a physical war.
[02:53:39.736 --> 02:53:41.037]  So let's do this.
[02:53:41.037 --> 02:53:44.660]  Let's not do anything offensive.
[02:53:44.660 --> 02:53:45.121]  But let's
[02:53:47.557 --> 02:53:54.801]  Reconnoiter ourselves and let's look around and let's not do any talking.
[02:53:54.801 --> 02:53:57.242]  Let's just get prepared.
[02:53:57.242 --> 02:53:58.302]  We know who the Globalists are.
[02:53:58.302 --> 02:53:59.943]  We know who their minions are.
[02:53:59.943 --> 02:54:04.225]  And if they want to start a fight, they want to go physical, they're going to get one.
[02:54:04.225 --> 02:54:07.767]  Now, before that happens, they're going to blow up a bunch of stuff and stage more mass shootings.
[02:54:07.767 --> 02:54:09.108]  And by the way,
[02:54:09.895 --> 02:54:12.656]  Both guys were antifa, not just the guy in Ohio.
[02:54:12.656 --> 02:54:14.237]  Both were devil worshippers.
[02:54:14.237 --> 02:54:16.198]  We went and looked at what they took down off social media.
[02:54:16.198 --> 02:54:19.760]  They never denied they took it off and said he was a Trump supporter and a right winger.
[02:54:19.760 --> 02:54:27.043]  The guy was an environmentalist, black trench coat wearing jerk-off who couldn't get girls.
[02:54:27.043 --> 02:54:33.286]  He was another incel that's programmed by this culture.
[02:54:33.286 --> 02:54:34.407]  And so was the slob
[02:54:38.971 --> 02:54:40.992]  In Ohio, they're the same people.
[02:54:40.992 --> 02:54:45.113]  They got that look in their eye like they love themselves, they're on a power trip, they live in their mother's basement.
[02:54:45.113 --> 02:54:47.214]  A lot of people live in their mother's basement, take care of their mother.
[02:54:47.214 --> 02:54:49.054]  I'm not saying you're bad if you live in your mother's basement.
[02:54:49.054 --> 02:54:50.555]  I'm not saying you're bad if you like to wear black.
[02:54:50.555 --> 02:54:51.775]  Johnny Cash did.
[02:54:51.775 --> 02:54:53.856]  I'm overweight, I like to wear all black.
[02:54:53.856 --> 02:54:54.977]  I'm just saying the M.O.
[02:54:54.977 --> 02:54:57.477]  of these guys, shoot them up video games.
[02:54:57.477 --> 02:55:00.759]  Normal people doesn't hurt you to play those.
[02:55:00.759 --> 02:55:07.701]  But if you're a mentally ill person, devil worshipping, and in a rock band that promotes pedophilia, oh yeah, these guys are all the same.
[02:55:10.635 --> 02:55:19.918]  Almost every shooter that does this is a devil-worshipping punk.
[02:55:19.918 --> 02:55:30.261]  So I said I'd get to the big enchilada, and I can always go into long pontifications, but what's left of this segment, the next segment, let me just get to it.
[02:55:30.261 --> 02:55:33.282]  The globalists know they're losing the information war.
[02:55:33.282 --> 02:55:35.543]  It's about all their censorship, all their bullying, it's backfiring.
[02:55:38.234 --> 02:55:40.356]  They were bullying before we were asleep.
[02:55:40.356 --> 02:55:44.699]  They think there's just not enough bullying now that we're not intimidated.
[02:55:44.699 --> 02:55:47.301]  See, they have that fundamental, because they're a bunch of followers.
[02:55:47.301 --> 02:55:50.343]  They are intimidated, most of them.
[02:55:50.343 --> 02:55:52.505]  So they keep thinking, man, we're just not bullying them enough.
[02:55:52.505 --> 02:55:53.165]  They're not submitting.
[02:55:53.165 --> 02:55:54.887]  No, we were asleep, dumbass.
[02:55:55.984 --> 02:56:02.306]  You think slapping us in the face and pissing on us now that we're awake makes us scared?
[02:56:02.306 --> 02:56:07.927]  You think death threatening us makes us scared?
[02:56:07.927 --> 02:56:11.268]  So let me just get this straight to the enemy.
[02:56:11.268 --> 02:56:17.670]  You are losers, and you're going to lose, and you should give up, but I know you aren't because of the spirit you carry.
[02:56:19.434 --> 02:56:38.253]  That said, because they're losing, they're gonna wind up, through all the studies, hype up mass shootings to more mentally ill people, more wind-up toys on antidepressants that make you kill people, that it says on the insert, who play shoot-em-up games and are devil worshipers, and in devil worship bands and into pedophilia.
[02:56:38.253 --> 02:56:41.055]  Always the same!
[02:56:41.055 --> 02:56:41.536]  Always the same!
[02:56:43.988 --> 02:56:46.129]  No background checks, no psychology.
[02:56:46.129 --> 02:56:48.670]  Most of these guys tell people, I'm going to kill everybody.
[02:56:48.670 --> 02:56:51.212]  Everybody just gets scared and does nothing.
[02:56:51.212 --> 02:56:54.413]  They do it in Democrat jurisdictions with their stand downs.
[02:56:54.413 --> 02:56:56.314]  Over and over again.
[02:56:56.314 --> 02:56:59.035]  So here's the big announcement.
[02:56:59.035 --> 02:57:00.176]  How do we get on the offense?
[02:57:00.176 --> 02:57:04.018]  How do you change one narrative with another narrative that's true?
[02:57:04.018 --> 02:57:07.560]  Because they always change a narrative that's true with a lie.
[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:08.000]  You haven't.
[02:57:08.882 --> 02:57:23.858]  Whether it's Luvox, or whether it's Prozac, or whether it's the other 50-something approved psychotropic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, every one of them says causes megalomania, psychotic breaks, mass murder, causes psychotic killing.
[02:57:23.858 --> 02:57:24.678]  That's it on the insert.
[02:57:25.925 --> 02:57:26.666]  And suicide.
[02:57:26.666 --> 02:57:28.688]  And you wonder why these people are all doing this.
[02:57:28.688 --> 02:57:32.773]  You add that, it's in the hallucinogen class, to somebody devil worshipping?
[02:57:32.773 --> 02:57:34.515]  It opens up those gates?
[02:57:34.515 --> 02:57:36.597]  These are demons carrying out these attacks.
[02:57:36.597 --> 02:57:41.824]  To get our guns to the organized criminal government and then slaughter us en masse with the satanic red carrot.
[02:57:43.516 --> 02:57:47.739]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[02:57:47.739 --> 02:57:52.522]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[02:57:52.522 --> 02:57:54.764]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[02:57:54.764 --> 02:57:56.765]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12.
[02:57:56.765 --> 02:57:59.147]  The very best vitamin B12 out there.
[02:57:59.147 --> 02:58:04.251]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[02:58:04.251 --> 02:58:06.072]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[02:58:06.072 --> 02:58:07.373]  Helps make DNA.
[02:58:07.373 --> 02:58:08.694]  Helps the body produce energy.
[02:58:08.694 --> 02:58:10.195]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[02:58:10.195 --> 02:58:12.196]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[02:58:12.196 --> 02:58:12.957]  It goes on and on.
[02:58:13.157 --> 02:58:21.281]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[02:58:21.281 --> 02:58:23.803]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[02:58:23.803 --> 02:58:30.646]  It helps summon the InfoWar, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:58:30.646 --> 02:58:35.969]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[02:58:35.969 --> 02:58:41.232]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:58:45.225 --> 02:58:50.967]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[02:58:50.967 --> 02:58:55.689]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[02:58:55.689 --> 02:58:59.170]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[02:58:59.170 --> 02:59:00.551]  It's been a bestseller.
[02:59:00.551 --> 02:59:12.095]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[02:59:12.555 --> 02:59:22.221]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[02:59:22.221 --> 02:59:27.465]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[02:59:27.725 --> 02:59:31.908]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[02:59:31.908 --> 02:59:35.650]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:35.650 --> 02:59:38.652]  Get your super silver skin cream today.
[02:59:38.652 --> 02:59:47.078]  We can only run this special for another week or so as of taping this September 10th.
[02:59:47.078 --> 02:59:49.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.753 --> 03:00:03.366]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:03.366 --> 03:00:05.593]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.224 --> 03:00:21.411]  Alright, so let me try to show you what I was getting to before we get into the fourth hour here where I've committed into it.
[03:00:21.411 --> 03:00:23.152]  Here's what I'm getting at.
[03:00:23.152 --> 03:00:29.798]  They know they're losing politically and culturally, so they're going to wind up in provocateur and even stage events, which we know they've been caught doing before.
[03:00:30.618 --> 03:00:46.842]  And they're going to blame everybody and say that the nation's run by white supremacist criminals, to not just try to cause a race war, but to start coming out with guns as they're already doing in seven states with red flag laws outside of law, killing veterans at their houses that don't even know what's going on, to try to trigger people to go out and start a 1776.
[03:00:46.842 --> 03:00:47.562]  We don't want that.
[03:00:51.988 --> 03:00:53.829]  We're winning politically.
[03:00:53.829 --> 03:00:56.450]  We do not need to go out and get in confrontations with people.
[03:00:56.450 --> 03:01:01.711]  If you live in a leftist jurisdiction and you can get out of it, get out of it.
[03:01:01.711 --> 03:01:06.173]  We're here in Austin, but the police on average aren't leftist, but the system's super bad.
[03:01:06.173 --> 03:01:10.154]  If I could pull back from this, I would, but I've been here, you know, in Texas my whole life.
[03:01:10.154 --> 03:01:13.535]  And Texas is just being invaded by the globalists.
[03:01:13.535 --> 03:01:15.656]  I got articles right here about how it's turning blue.
[03:01:15.656 --> 03:01:18.457]  It's just, if the country's in trouble, we better turn this back now.
[03:01:18.457 --> 03:01:20.898]  And the enemy knows how close it is, that's why they're pushing so hard.
[03:01:22.984 --> 03:01:24.905]  They want to cause a physical civil war.
[03:01:24.905 --> 03:01:26.385]  We don't need that to happen.
[03:01:26.385 --> 03:01:29.887]  If they're able to trigger it, then we gotta fight for our lives.
[03:01:29.887 --> 03:01:31.607]  And once it starts, that means offensive.
[03:01:31.607 --> 03:01:36.109]  But they are going to stage events and say it's us that are targeting innocents.
[03:01:36.109 --> 03:01:37.950]  We know that's them.
[03:01:37.950 --> 03:01:39.411]  Okay?
[03:01:39.411 --> 03:01:42.892]  And people don't buy anything the news says anymore, so we're gonna win this.
[03:01:42.892 --> 03:01:49.215]  It's just, the globalists are a bunch of wind-up toys for their boss, the devil.
[03:01:49.215 --> 03:01:50.235]  And so they're not gonna stop.
[03:01:52.651 --> 03:01:56.853]  Unless we go on a different counter-offensive.
[03:01:56.853 --> 03:02:02.075]  And they were going to have me on for the whole hour on Piers Morgan.
[03:02:02.075 --> 03:02:11.799]  But when he was accusing gun makers of killing people, I said, Piers, you just had an antidepressant ad on.
[03:02:11.799 --> 03:02:14.320]  It's suicide mass murder pills that are causing it.
[03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:17.141]  The damn insert says it makes you do that.
[03:02:18.851 --> 03:02:20.994]  They have to tell you that so they, quote, can't be sued.
[03:02:20.994 --> 03:02:22.256]  Well, they can be sued.
[03:02:22.256 --> 03:02:23.418]  And the companies know it.
[03:02:23.418 --> 03:02:25.041]  And the people that subscribe it know it.
[03:02:25.041 --> 03:02:29.207]  And almost every one of these guys is on it, so we turn it around about the pills.
[03:02:30.401 --> 03:02:38.906]  That in 99% of the cases they're on, and that they're not profiling these people, and they're not stopping them when in every case they're talking about how they're going to kill people.
[03:02:38.906 --> 03:02:44.689]  In the Parkland case, he did it 44 times, and twice at the FBI, 46 times!
[03:02:44.689 --> 03:02:48.911]  20 plus times with the devil worshipper in Ohio, and I could go on for hours!
[03:02:48.911 --> 03:02:55.534]  The guy in Houston, outside Houston a few years ago that killed a bunch of people, he was a devil worshipper!
[03:02:55.534 --> 03:02:58.036]  He wore pentagrams, swastikas, and communists.
[03:02:59.551 --> 03:03:05.695]  Red flags to scare people!
[03:03:05.695 --> 03:03:15.581]  And so, we have to get on the offense about how the media hyping it, the study show makes copycats do it, and how they are sick and know what they're doing.
[03:03:15.581 --> 03:03:16.602]  That means protesting them.
[03:03:16.602 --> 03:03:17.722]  That means suing them.
[03:03:17.722 --> 03:03:19.884]  That means getting aggressive.
[03:03:19.884 --> 03:03:21.645]  That means educating others.
[03:03:21.645 --> 03:03:22.925]  That means picketing.
[03:03:22.925 --> 03:03:28.429]  That means going to city council, whether you're in a Republican area or Democratic area, and speaking, and it goes out on cable.
[03:03:29.674 --> 03:03:31.854]  Or having your own rally.
[03:03:31.854 --> 03:03:32.835]  Or printing up pamphlets.
[03:03:32.835 --> 03:03:34.675]  Or starting your own website.
[03:03:34.675 --> 03:03:39.116]  If you just take a few people out shooting and teach them how self-defense works.
[03:03:39.116 --> 03:03:40.276]  A few leftists.
[03:03:40.276 --> 03:03:43.656]  There's a lot of ways to do this, but it's fundamental.
[03:03:43.656 --> 03:03:52.678]  They want the right to kill babies, and they want the right to take our guns, so that they can take over the state and have their way with us, which they admit they want.
[03:03:52.678 --> 03:03:54.078]  So that's what it comes down to.
[03:03:54.078 --> 03:03:58.519]  Now, I'll cover this more tomorrow in a special transmission I'm going to start doing Saturdays.
[03:03:59.741 --> 03:04:00.521]  Two to four p.m.
[03:04:00.521 --> 03:04:02.722]  is going to be called the Infowars Roundtable.
[03:04:02.722 --> 03:04:07.162]  It'll be on a page on Infowars.com and at band.video.
[03:04:07.162 --> 03:04:13.923]  Last night, I was really impressed with Robert Barnes and the rest of the guests and hosts we had.
[03:04:13.923 --> 03:04:19.144]  I mean, Will Johnson was doing an amazing job, Owen Schroyer, Tom Papert, Harrison Smith.
[03:04:19.144 --> 03:04:20.124]  It was really powerful.
[03:04:20.124 --> 03:04:28.846]  So, you know I love to talk, but here are some excerpts from last night's debate coverage on Second Amendment that we're going to be breaking down
[03:04:30.202 --> 03:04:33.645]  On the other side, and laying out in the war room, 3 o'clock central.
[03:04:33.645 --> 03:04:37.669]  And again, this is the antidote to the globalist poison, what we're doing here.
[03:04:37.669 --> 03:04:39.590]  And I know you're awake!
[03:04:39.590 --> 03:04:41.692]  This isn't a video game, this is the real world.

[03:04:43.414 --> 03:04:44.775]  That's not as censored as much.

[03:04:47.337 --> 03:04:49.219]  The Vermont Show is still on the air!

[03:05:43.105 --> 03:05:44.106]  It's Happies.
[03:05:44.106 --> 03:05:47.087]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLive.com.

[03:05:56.791 --> 03:05:58.031]  You found it.
[03:05:58.031 --> 03:06:00.072]  The tip of the spear.
[03:06:00.072 --> 03:06:02.373]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:10.091 --> 03:06:18.573]  So far, what we've been able to watch during the orgy of promising to confiscate firearms was this exchange where Biden says we're going to confiscate all semi-autos.
[03:06:18.573 --> 03:06:24.755]  That's 90% of the firearms or more in this country, including most hunting shotguns, even though, obviously, the Second Amendment's not really about hunting.
[03:06:24.755 --> 03:06:31.617]  It's about defending yourself from common criminals and also a corrupt, out-of-control government, which killed 200 million people in the last century after they confiscated the guns.
[03:06:31.617 --> 03:06:35.718]  That's a lot more than the couple hundred a year that died in mass shootings, which again, they hype up like it's the end of the world.
[03:06:35.718 --> 03:06:38.519]  It's certainly terrible, but microscopic compared to, say, drowning and
[03:06:39.239 --> 03:06:39.640]  I don't
[03:06:58.439 --> 03:07:02.021]  You know, if you didn't have this mass shooting restaurant, people wouldn't walk into it.
[03:07:02.021 --> 03:07:06.684]  But it's something put out there to weak minds, creating a domino effect or a copycat effect.
[03:07:06.684 --> 03:07:09.546]  And again, major studies all admit that anybody can pull that up for themselves.
[03:07:09.546 --> 03:07:14.590]  Type in major studies, prove that the media is actually triggering these with these type of lunatics that are out there.
[03:07:14.590 --> 03:07:26.057]  The mass murder bills and the serotonin reuptake inhibitor class, of course, are known as so-called antidepressants to cause megalomania, psychotic breaks, mass murder, suicide massively off the chart.
[03:07:26.057 --> 03:07:27.138]  It's on the damn insert.
[03:07:27.418 --> 03:07:35.903]  So we should start targeting Big Pharma with lawsuits and calls for them to be blamed for it because they actually are in the wheelhouse centrally, not guns.
[03:07:35.903 --> 03:07:38.164]  And then they'll back off real quick trying to take our guns.
[03:07:38.164 --> 03:07:41.406]  So there's a lot of ways to stop this situation.
[03:07:41.406 --> 03:07:54.594]  But I wanted to play this clip because what's amazing is Harris saying, hey, doesn't matter if it's in the Constitution, the president can't sign an executive order and make law and circumvent the legislative and of course even the judicial and take
[03:07:55.174 --> 03:07:55.674]  How are you?
[03:08:20.450 --> 03:08:24.115]  He isn't confiscating all of the guns.
[03:08:24.115 --> 03:08:26.859]  So let's go ahead and go to that video.
[03:08:27.992 --> 03:08:33.157]  Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street, period.
[03:08:33.157 --> 03:08:36.220]  And we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements.
[03:08:36.220 --> 03:08:43.066]  In recent days, former Vice President Biden has said about executive orders, some really talented people are seeking the nomination.
[03:08:43.066 --> 03:08:44.708]  They said, I'm going to issue an executive order.
[03:08:44.708 --> 03:08:50.673]  Biden's saying there's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say, I'm going to eliminate assault weapons.
[03:08:50.673 --> 03:08:52.115]  Does the vice president have a point there?
[03:08:52.758 --> 03:08:58.642]  I mean, I would just say, hey Joe, instead of saying no we can't, let's say yes we can.
[03:08:58.642 --> 03:09:03.545]  Let's be constitutional.
[03:09:03.545 --> 03:09:06.748]  And yes we can, because I'll tell you something.
[03:09:06.748 --> 03:09:10.150]  Well, do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?
[03:09:10.150 --> 03:09:15.954]  I said, well look, I mean obviously he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.
[03:09:16.570 --> 03:09:20.011]  By the way, you can't own the following weapons, period.
[03:09:20.011 --> 03:09:21.992]  They cannot be sold anymore.
[03:09:21.992 --> 03:09:29.014]  You said, quote, Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them.
[03:09:29.014 --> 03:09:30.814]  You know, the critics call this confiscation.
[03:09:30.814 --> 03:09:34.976]  Are you proposing taking away their guns, and how would this work?
[03:09:34.976 --> 03:09:35.596]  I am.
[03:09:35.596 --> 03:09:40.597]  If it's a weapon that was designed to kill people, hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[03:09:40.597 --> 03:09:45.979]  We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.
[03:09:46.758 --> 03:09:50.261]  Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban.
[03:09:50.261 --> 03:09:56.947]  Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which, by the way, would have made a huge difference if that was in place.
[03:09:56.947 --> 03:09:59.729]  They know full well you have a couple hundred people killed a year in mass shootings.
[03:09:59.729 --> 03:10:00.690]  It's super rare.
[03:10:00.690 --> 03:10:01.331]  They hype it up.
[03:10:01.331 --> 03:10:02.992]  That actually causes more people to do it.
[03:10:02.992 --> 03:10:03.833]  They're hoping for it.
[03:10:03.833 --> 03:10:05.795]  These are criminals that want to disarm their slaves.
[03:10:06.155 --> 03:10:07.536]  They're fully aware of what they're doing.
[03:10:07.536 --> 03:10:13.420]  They don't talk about the 200,000 dead in Mexico the last 10 years, where they have a total ban on guns for citizens, but one of the highest crime rates in the world.
[03:10:13.420 --> 03:10:15.922]  Chicago, ban on guns, highest crime rate in the U.S.
[03:10:15.922 --> 03:10:17.443]  These dirtbags know what they're doing.
[03:10:17.443 --> 03:10:18.403]  They're not idiots.
[03:10:18.403 --> 03:10:22.726]  They're wanton front men of international criminals that want to enslave this nation.
[03:10:22.726 --> 03:10:25.848]  1776 is why this country started, when the Redcoats came to take the guns.
[03:10:25.848 --> 03:10:32.032]  And if they try to take our firearms, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[03:10:36.516 --> 03:10:51.458]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's go to Tom Papert now and we'll go down the line here and get his take on that amazing exchange we just played right there.
[03:10:53.288 --> 03:10:55.429]  It was utterly disturbing.
[03:10:55.429 --> 03:10:57.871]  What was with Kamala Harris there?
[03:10:57.871 --> 03:10:59.171]  That was the strangest voice.
[03:10:59.171 --> 03:11:03.874]  That woman seems to have 15 different personalities all trapped within her fragile mind.
[03:11:03.874 --> 03:11:05.595]  And that was just bizarre.
[03:11:05.595 --> 03:11:09.717]  She sounded like a college frat girl who'd had one too many drinks.
[03:11:09.717 --> 03:11:12.399]  Hey, Joe, let's just take the guns.
[03:11:12.399 --> 03:11:13.840]  It's no big deal, Joe.
[03:11:13.840 --> 03:11:15.481]  Say yes, we can take the guns.
[03:11:16.321 --> 03:11:30.793]  Utterly bizarre, and again, I think it shows that these Democrats, they think that they've finally, they're either delusional, and they think that they've finally got the fire in the American bellies to take our guns, and like Alex said, 1776 will commence again, or else, they're just throwing it away.
[03:11:30.793 --> 03:11:34.516]  They're just throwing it away at this point.
[03:11:34.516 --> 03:11:37.218]  Is it me, or did Kamala Harris sound drunk in that exchange?
[03:11:37.218 --> 03:11:39.600]  I didn't notice it the first time, but she sounded drunk!
[03:11:41.025 --> 03:11:42.968]  Joe!
[03:11:42.968 --> 03:11:44.370]  Oh, Joe!
[03:11:44.370 --> 03:11:45.952]  Just say yes we can.
[03:11:45.952 --> 03:11:47.354]  It's gonna be alright, Joe.
[03:11:47.354 --> 03:11:49.117]  Just say yes we can take the guns.
[03:11:49.117 --> 03:11:51.840]  I mean, hey, a little liquid courage, I mean, I'll, you know, fine.
[03:11:52.950 --> 03:11:56.514]  And by the way, he wasn't even saying we can't do it if we pass a law.
[03:11:56.514 --> 03:12:02.240]  She's saying outside of Congress, you're the constitutional lawyer, let's go to Barnes and then to Johnson and Owen.
[03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:03.261]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[03:12:03.261 --> 03:12:05.363]  He's saying you can't do that, it's unconstitutional.
[03:12:05.363 --> 03:12:09.187]  She's saying become a dictator, everything they accused Trump of.
[03:12:09.187 --> 03:12:14.372]  So Kamala Harris just said we need a dictator to circumvent Congress and confiscate 90% of the guns.
[03:12:15.293 --> 03:12:18.736]  Yeah, what she said specifically was, yes, we can violate the Second Amendment.
[03:12:18.736 --> 03:12:20.377]  That's what yes, we can means.
[03:12:20.377 --> 03:12:34.650]  Yes, we can means that if she's elected and almost any of the other Democrats who are elected on stage are going to take the position that they can take executive orders beyond even what President Obama was willing to do and to directly infringe Second Amendment rights.
[03:12:34.950 --> 03:12:37.151]  According to Vice President Joe Biden.
[03:12:37.151 --> 03:12:40.794]  You know, this isn't a liberal or left-leaning position.
[03:12:40.794 --> 03:12:48.098]  This is someone on the left, Joe Biden, saying that this would be a violation of fundamental constitutional Second Amendment rights.
[03:12:48.098 --> 03:12:54.943]  And the fact that he can say that, and yet the Kamala Harris sort of march on in this cause of confiscation.
[03:12:54.943 --> 03:13:00.186]  To where the most viral moment tonight, within the Democratic primary process on social media,
[03:13:00.826 --> 03:13:05.868]  Is Beto O'Rourke saying, hey, hell yes, we're going to take your guns.
[03:13:05.868 --> 03:13:07.728]  We're going to confiscate your guns.
[03:13:07.728 --> 03:13:09.109]  We're going to take them away.
[03:13:09.109 --> 03:13:15.971]  So the Democratic Party is celebrating tonight that they are going to obliterate and abolish the Second Amendment rights of ordinary Americans.
[03:13:16.451 --> 03:13:22.499]  So it's a precarious time to have only the criminals or the government be in monopolistic control over guns.
[03:13:22.499 --> 03:13:28.107]  The whole purpose of the Second Amendment was to prohibit that exact reality, but Kamala Harris made clear she will make it a reality.
[03:13:28.107 --> 03:13:29.709]  And Bob, you're absolutely right.
[03:13:29.709 --> 03:13:32.613]  Everyone's focusing on Beto going, hell yeah, we're gonna take all your guns!
[03:13:33.334 --> 03:13:34.235]  You damn Americans!
[03:13:34.235 --> 03:13:35.436]  He says, you Americans!
[03:13:35.436 --> 03:13:40.702]  I mean, but the big one for me is, she's going, come on, we can do it outside of law.
[03:13:40.702 --> 03:13:42.304]  We'll just be a dictator.
[03:13:42.304 --> 03:13:43.965]  I mean, whoa!
[03:13:43.965 --> 03:13:51.113]  These are the people that under the law, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, we don't just have a right, but a duty to resist, and we don't even want to go to war with them.
[03:13:51.113 --> 03:13:52.214]  They're coming to war with us.
[03:13:52.214 --> 03:13:53.596]  Why do you think I want to go to the other guys?
[03:13:55.011 --> 03:14:06.599]  Why do you think they've gone from denying this behind the scenes, doing it in every other country, every blue city, to now admitting, we're coming to take your guns, we're taking your kids, and we're going to teach them to chop their genitals off.
[03:14:06.599 --> 03:14:13.684]  I mean, these people are just, and I've got a seven minute video here today of Democrats going, I love to kill my baby, especially little girls.
[03:14:13.684 --> 03:14:15.145]  I love to stand over their dead body.
[03:14:15.145 --> 03:14:19.088]  I've got articles where they take photos of the dead bodies and the women celebrate it and have sex with their boyfriend.
[03:14:19.568 --> 03:14:21.971]  Get me pregnant again, I'm gonna kill another little bastard.
[03:14:21.971 --> 03:14:28.439]  And I'm watching this, and they're on TV going, get that little bastard on Netflix.
[03:14:28.439 --> 03:14:31.843]  It's not Hellraiser, it's not a fake movie.
[03:14:31.843 --> 03:14:34.447]  These people are literally psychotics.
[03:14:34.827 --> 03:15:00.924]  Well, if you go back, it's sort of very much like the Burkean critique of the French Revolution, which is that once you abandon standards, abandon traditions, abandon religion, abandon certain community ideas and ideals that have been here with our history and precedent forever, once you abandon sort of Gary Will's understanding of conservatism, which he documented in his brilliant book, Nixon Agonistics, once you do that, you have no standards, and you end up with a guillotine culture, and a guillotine culture that just kills.
[03:15:00.924 --> 03:15:02.225]  Because the very worst takes over.
[03:15:02.225 --> 03:15:04.667]  You sink right to the worst, and the worst takes charge.
[03:15:05.568 --> 03:15:07.489]  Because you have to out-radical what was radical.
[03:15:07.489 --> 03:15:08.590]  You have to become even more radical.
[03:15:08.590 --> 03:15:13.054]  And you say, okay, well first we killed off the princes and the popes and the kings, okay.
[03:15:13.054 --> 03:15:14.015]  Well who do we kill off next?
[03:15:14.015 --> 03:15:15.417]  Well we start killing off commoners.
[03:15:15.417 --> 03:15:16.377]  Well that's not really enough.
[03:15:16.377 --> 03:15:17.438]  Let's start killing off each other.
[03:15:17.438 --> 03:15:20.441]  I mean, that's what the French... Well that farmer's got a better crop than me.
[03:15:20.441 --> 03:15:21.302]  I'll just murder him!
[03:15:21.482 --> 03:15:21.802]  Exactly.
[03:15:21.802 --> 03:15:26.806]  It's sort of where Mugabe went with the sort of craziness of his policies and politics.
[03:15:26.806 --> 03:15:32.809]  It's about power, the worship of power, and the lack of respect for certain tradition and limits on the abuse and misuse of power.
[03:15:32.809 --> 03:15:37.453]  Because Christianity in its real form is about limits on that and not running over people.
[03:15:37.453 --> 03:15:40.615]  And instead Christianity's now been about letting the evil run over you.
[03:15:40.615 --> 03:15:43.937]  Amazing points.
[03:15:43.937 --> 03:15:48.640]  All in all, it's just a little brick in the wall.

[03:17:32.981 --> 03:17:33.061]  800-600-3388.
[03:17:33.061 --> 03:17:34.242]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners.
[03:17:34.242 --> 03:17:35.904]  Consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[03:17:35.904 --> 03:17:38.287]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[03:17:52.441 --> 03:17:56.664]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third best seller.
[03:17:56.664 --> 03:18:01.447]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[03:18:01.447 --> 03:18:03.689]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[03:18:03.689 --> 03:18:05.690]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12.
[03:18:05.690 --> 03:18:08.072]  The very best vitamin B12 out there.
[03:18:08.072 --> 03:18:13.176]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[03:18:13.176 --> 03:18:14.997]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[03:18:14.997 --> 03:18:16.298]  Helps make DNA.
[03:18:16.298 --> 03:18:17.619]  Helps the body produce energy.
[03:18:17.619 --> 03:18:19.120]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[03:18:19.120 --> 03:18:21.121]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[03:18:21.121 --> 03:18:21.882]  It goes on and on.
[03:18:22.082 --> 03:18:30.187]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[03:18:30.187 --> 03:18:32.729]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.

[03:19:14.085 --> 03:19:20.730]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[03:19:20.730 --> 03:19:22.512]  It sells itself.
[03:19:22.512 --> 03:19:31.279]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[03:19:31.279 --> 03:19:32.620]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[03:19:33.140 --> 03:19:45.511]  Well, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, and it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[03:19:45.511 --> 03:19:48.875]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[03:19:48.875 --> 03:19:56.121]  50% off on Body's at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:19:56.121 --> 03:19:58.784]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:03.434 --> 03:20:06.316]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[03:20:06.316 --> 03:20:08.578]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:20:08.578 --> 03:20:10.599]  Why are they doing this now?
[03:20:10.599 --> 03:20:15.663]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[03:20:15.663 --> 03:20:24.429]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:24.429 --> 03:20:29.413]  Now that they kicked him off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[03:20:29.693 --> 03:20:33.614]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[03:20:33.614 --> 03:20:42.438]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say, you know, all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[03:20:42.438 --> 03:20:43.998]  I have no issue with it at all.
[03:20:43.998 --> 03:20:45.079]  I want them shut down.
[03:20:45.079 --> 03:20:46.039]  I want them silenced.
[03:20:46.039 --> 03:20:46.879]  I want them muted.
[03:20:46.879 --> 03:20:50.020]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:20:50.020 --> 03:20:51.421]  I want them shut down!
[03:20:51.421 --> 03:20:52.981]  I want them silenced!
[03:20:52.981 --> 03:20:54.222]  I want them muted!
[03:20:54.222 --> 03:20:55.482]  But don't worry.
[03:20:55.482 --> 03:20:57.183]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[03:21:02.631 --> 03:21:13.097]  So let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.
[03:21:13.097 --> 03:21:20.381]  We all fought against it and then the late great John McCain at that moment at about 2 o'clock in the morning killed his
[03:21:21.221 --> 03:21:26.763]  Attempt to take health care from millions of people in this country.
[03:21:26.763 --> 03:21:29.944]  Fast forward to today and what is happening.
[03:21:29.944 --> 03:21:35.786]  Donald Trump's Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.
[03:21:35.786 --> 03:21:39.267]  Donald Trump's administration is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.
[03:21:39.267 --> 03:21:42.508]  Donald Trump's administration is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.
[03:21:44.619 --> 03:21:48.985]  But she's such a lying corporate fraud, and they even admit she got her job.
[03:21:48.985 --> 03:21:53.872]  I mean, Willie Brown bragged, you know, which I'm not attacking her for that, but she's just a fraud.
[03:21:54.659 --> 03:21:56.460]  Yeah, oh yeah, oh, you know that about that.
[03:21:56.460 --> 03:22:00.841]  I've said consistently she's the dumbest lawyer I've ever dealt with in any case.
[03:22:00.841 --> 03:22:01.962]  Oh, you've been in cases with her?
[03:22:01.962 --> 03:22:04.062]  Oh yes, yes, on multiple cases.
[03:22:04.062 --> 03:22:05.783]  And she's just not bright.
[03:22:05.783 --> 03:22:07.223]  What she's good at is this.
[03:22:07.223 --> 03:22:09.504]  She's good at grandstanding in the public arena.
[03:22:09.504 --> 03:22:10.925]  That's literally all she's good at.
[03:22:10.925 --> 03:22:14.646]  Well, were we able, just I know on the fly, to find that important meme that was put out at memeworld.com?
[03:22:17.267 --> 03:22:21.050]  Okay, well, it's just important.
[03:22:21.050 --> 03:22:23.852]  It's her on wanting to ban meat.
[03:22:23.852 --> 03:22:32.740]  I mean, she's come out, and being serious, Millie talked to some of the Democrats about how they want to ban meat, and de Blasio, he made a joke about it, but now they're openly saying that, Millie.
[03:22:33.815 --> 03:22:35.455]  Oh yeah, they want to be on me.
[03:22:35.455 --> 03:22:36.435]  They're radical.
[03:22:36.435 --> 03:22:39.596]  Most of these politicians are radical that are running.
[03:22:39.596 --> 03:22:47.377]  And only Amy Klobuchar and Joe Biden are some of the ones that are somewhat more moderate, but the progressives are rejecting them.
[03:22:47.377 --> 03:22:49.398]  The woke millennials, they don't want them.
[03:22:49.398 --> 03:22:51.878]  And another thing- Hold on, hold on, I don't even know if Biden's talking!
[03:22:51.878 --> 03:22:52.418]  Let's go back, sorry!
[03:22:52.418 --> 03:22:53.258]  You got insurance.
[03:22:53.258 --> 03:22:55.819]  They're going to give back that money to the employee?
[03:22:55.819 --> 03:22:56.979]  Matter of fact, they will.
[03:22:56.979 --> 03:22:59.619]  Let me tell you something.
[03:22:59.619 --> 03:23:02.660]  For a socialist, you got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.
[03:23:03.080 --> 03:23:03.981]  Wow, that was a good one!
[03:23:03.981 --> 03:23:05.882]  Yeah, you're good with a line.
[03:23:05.882 --> 03:23:13.887]  Corporate America with socialists will screw you over so fast, but the big globalists want socialism, because then it's a centralized system to suck the money offshore!
[03:23:13.887 --> 03:23:17.509]  We have 87 million people uninsured and underinsured.
[03:23:17.509 --> 03:23:18.029]  That's a dogfight!
[03:23:18.029 --> 03:23:21.331]  You've got to defend the fact that 500,000 Americans are going bankrupt.
[03:23:21.331 --> 03:23:22.412]  Now him and Obama are bad.
[03:23:22.412 --> 03:23:23.092]  They're not good enough.
[03:23:23.092 --> 03:23:23.853]  Exactly.
[03:23:23.853 --> 03:23:25.194]  You know why they're going bankrupt?
[03:23:25.754 --> 03:23:30.397]  Because they suffered a terrible disease, cancer, or heart disease.
[03:23:30.397 --> 03:23:32.838]  Under my legislation... You dirty Americans, pay for it!
[03:23:32.838 --> 03:23:37.041]  Go to Venezuela, you jerk-off, lying sack of filth.
[03:23:37.041 --> 03:23:41.964]  He's trying to piss people off and have cancer, but they're putting the damn viruses in the vaccines.
[03:23:45.512 --> 03:23:46.293]  It's personal to me.
[03:23:46.293 --> 03:23:47.894]  Let me tell you something.
[03:23:47.894 --> 03:23:53.538]  Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease... Why didn't that nurse get the most time?
[03:23:53.538 --> 03:23:55.340]  ...become part of this plan.
[03:23:55.340 --> 03:23:58.342]  They will not go bankrupt because of that.
[03:23:58.342 --> 03:24:00.023]  They will not go bankrupt because of that.
[03:24:00.023 --> 03:24:01.384]  They can join immediately.
[03:24:01.384 --> 03:24:07.749]  And we're talking 4, 6, 8, 10 years, depending on who you talk about, before we get to Medicare for All.
[03:24:07.749 --> 03:24:08.810]  Come on.
[03:24:08.810 --> 03:24:09.411]  I've been there.
[03:24:09.411 --> 03:24:10.171]  You've been there.
[03:24:10.171 --> 03:24:11.332]  You know what it's like.
[03:24:11.332 --> 03:24:14.495]  People need help now, hope now, and do something now.
[03:24:14.915 --> 03:24:22.476]  Congressman O'Rourke.
[03:24:22.476 --> 03:24:31.718]  I'm grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections that we have right now.
[03:24:31.718 --> 03:24:42.200]  But I also think we're being offered a false choice between those who propose an all-or-nothing gambit, forcing tens of millions off of insurance that they like, that works for them, to force them onto Medicare,
[03:24:42.640 --> 03:24:56.969]  And others who want to, as the Vice President does, incrementally improve what we have, which will still leave many, maybe millions, uninsured and uncared for in a state like Texas, where the largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system.
[03:24:56.969 --> 03:24:57.890]  We've got to do better.
[03:24:57.890 --> 03:25:03.934]  And my proposal, Medicare for America, says everyone who's uninsured will be enrolled in Medicare.
[03:25:03.934 --> 03:25:08.096]  Everyone who's insufficiently insured, cannot afford it, can move over to Medicare.
[03:25:08.096 --> 03:25:11.759]  And those, like members of unions, who fought for the health care plans that work for them,
[03:25:12.539 --> 03:25:15.741]  That is the best possible path forward.
[03:25:15.741 --> 03:25:18.983]  Healthcare is the top issue for everyone in the country.
[03:25:18.983 --> 03:25:20.744]  Everyone gets one minute to respond.
[03:25:20.744 --> 03:25:25.207]  So, Senator Castro, Andrew Yang, and then Senator Booker, you all get a minute.
[03:25:25.207 --> 03:25:25.687]  Thank you.
[03:25:25.687 --> 03:25:29.929]  And you know, I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this.
[03:25:29.929 --> 03:25:33.891]  And of course, we owe a debt of gratitude to President Barack Obama.
[03:25:33.891 --> 03:25:36.433]  Castro looks like he's like Kim Jong Un.
[03:25:36.733 --> 03:25:37.153]  I don't know.
[03:25:59.127 --> 03:26:13.950]  Well, I think that if we decide to adopt this medical for all policies that the Democrats want, our nation will forever be enslaved by the burden of paying for all these sick people's health care bills.
[03:26:13.950 --> 03:26:17.171]  I mean, America is a sick nation.
[03:26:17.171 --> 03:26:24.613]  People get vaccinated, they take all the big pharma pills, they eat all the garbage eugenics food, and then their bodies are sick.
[03:26:24.933 --> 03:26:25.153]  Angry Biden.
[03:26:44.680 --> 03:26:45.740]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[03:26:45.740 --> 03:26:48.121]  That was the most smartest thing I've heard today on the show.
[03:26:48.121 --> 03:26:49.562]  We've been going live since 8 a.m.
[03:26:49.562 --> 03:27:11.128]  is that Big Pharma is pushing all these toxic chemicals, all these things onto us and then they know full well it's making us sicker and then it bankrupts the system more and they get a bigger and bigger piece of the GDP and they're just phasing us into this medical tyranny now where the medical tyrants will decide who can have guns and who can't outside of due process and as you were just saying, Biden's getting madder and madder as you predicted tonight.
[03:27:11.348 --> 03:27:12.851]  Yeah, he is.
[03:27:12.851 --> 03:27:15.115]  He can't control his anger.
[03:27:15.115 --> 03:27:15.976]  Which normally he does.
[03:27:15.976 --> 03:27:17.859]  Let's go back to Biden.
[03:27:17.859 --> 03:27:21.165]  Fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you're not.
[03:27:21.165 --> 03:27:22.207]  I would be surprised at him.
[03:27:27.003 --> 03:27:30.005]  This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable.
[03:27:30.005 --> 03:27:34.528]  This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington.
[03:27:34.528 --> 03:27:44.013]  Scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that your, my plan, your plan, look, we all have different visions of what is better about our country.
[03:27:44.013 --> 03:27:45.814]  That's called an election.
[03:27:45.814 --> 03:27:46.695]  That's an election.
[03:27:46.695 --> 03:27:49.317]  That looks like the meaning, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:27:49.317 --> 03:27:50.817]  He's smart to test her though.
[03:27:50.817 --> 03:27:52.478]  That he would try to make his case.
[03:27:52.478 --> 03:27:53.059]  He had it.
[03:27:53.399 --> 03:27:55.164]  Breakthrough tonight at some level.
[03:27:55.164 --> 03:27:59.035]  They took shots at Biden, now he's taking shots at Buttigieg.
[03:27:59.035 --> 03:28:00.179]  They're just talking over each other.
[03:28:02.876 --> 03:28:05.357]  And I believe we're talking about this the wrong way.
[03:28:05.357 --> 03:28:11.360]  As someone who has run a business, I know that our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire employers.
[03:28:11.360 --> 03:28:12.540]  We don't need free healthcare.
[03:28:12.540 --> 03:28:13.461]  We just need free money.
[03:28:13.461 --> 03:28:14.441]  Let's give everybody free money.
[03:28:14.441 --> 03:28:14.861]  That solves it.
[03:28:14.861 --> 03:28:16.282]  Don't have to worry about free healthcare control.
[03:28:16.282 --> 03:28:19.283]  It's just money for you, money for you, money for you, more money for you, more money for you.
[03:28:19.283 --> 03:28:25.486]  The pitch we have to make to the American people is we will get the healthcare weight off of your backs and then unleash the whole community.
[03:28:25.486 --> 03:28:27.647]  The leader of Zimbabwe tried that, Robert Mugabe.
[03:28:27.647 --> 03:28:28.707]  Then it was like what, $25 billion?
[03:28:31.369 --> 03:28:33.952]  Uh, of their currency was equivalent of one.
[03:28:33.952 --> 03:28:34.833]  Yeah.
[03:28:34.833 --> 03:28:38.317]  And so after that it was like, well, let's kill the white people and take all their property.
[03:28:38.317 --> 03:28:40.319]  And that's basically what he did.
[03:28:40.319 --> 03:28:41.440]  Now it's totally collapsed.
[03:28:41.440 --> 03:28:42.121]  Oh, completely.
[03:28:42.121 --> 03:28:45.525]  So it turned out getting rid of all your best farmers is not a good idea for the economy.
[03:28:52.222 --> 03:29:03.265]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[03:29:53.055 --> 03:29:58.820]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[03:29:58.820 --> 03:30:03.544]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[03:30:03.544 --> 03:30:06.266]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it.
[03:30:06.266 --> 03:30:07.708]  In the last two years, it's been a bestseller.
[03:30:08.368 --> 03:30:20.415]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[03:30:20.415 --> 03:30:30.060]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[03:30:30.060 --> 03:30:35.303]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[03:30:35.563 --> 03:30:43.494]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price, and it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:30:43.494 --> 03:30:46.498]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[03:30:46.498 --> 03:30:50.784]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[03:30:52.782 --> 03:31:00.210]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you the products that Infowarslife.com are.
[03:31:00.210 --> 03:31:13.505]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[03:31:14.005 --> 03:31:20.648]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[03:31:20.648 --> 03:31:22.428]  It sells itself.
[03:31:22.428 --> 03:31:30.452]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[03:31:31.352 --> 03:31:33.053]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[03:31:33.053 --> 03:31:45.420]  Well, BODY'S Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[03:31:45.420 --> 03:31:48.782]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[03:31:48.782 --> 03:31:50.583]  50% off on BODY'S at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:51.704 --> 03:31:55.946]  We sold Secret 12 for four years and it was our number third bestseller.
[03:31:55.946 --> 03:32:00.728]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[03:32:00.728 --> 03:32:02.970]  That new formula is Ultra 12.
[03:32:02.970 --> 03:32:04.970]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12.
[03:32:04.970 --> 03:32:07.352]  The very best vitamin B12 out there.
[03:32:07.352 --> 03:32:12.454]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things.
[03:32:12.454 --> 03:32:14.275]  Supports healthy nerve and brain cells.
[03:32:14.275 --> 03:32:15.556]  Helps make DNA.
[03:32:15.556 --> 03:32:16.896]  Helps the body produce energy.
[03:32:16.896 --> 03:32:18.397]  Helps produce healthy blood cells.
[03:32:18.397 --> 03:32:20.358]  Essential for proper nervous system function.
[03:32:20.538 --> 03:32:21.638]  It goes on and on.
[03:32:21.638 --> 03:32:29.480]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[03:32:29.480 --> 03:32:32.021]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12.
[03:32:32.021 --> 03:32:38.863]  It helps fund the InfoWar, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:32:38.863 --> 03:32:44.184]  Again, we can only run the special for the next two weeks or so while supplies last.
[03:32:44.184 --> 03:32:49.426]  Ultra 12, twice as powerful, half the price, 50% off right now at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:32:55.590 --> 03:33:04.392]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:04.392 --> 03:33:08.173]  We are in an information war.
[03:33:08.173 --> 03:33:17.335]  Our objective is to destroy the false narrative by reminding as many people as possible to think for themselves and question everything.
[03:33:18.908 --> 03:33:22.349]  We were effective, and so they tried to destroy us.
[03:33:22.349 --> 03:33:28.330]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers.
[03:33:28.330 --> 03:33:33.231]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[03:33:33.231 --> 03:33:38.052]  This stuff is not speech, it's incitement, harassment, defamation.
[03:33:38.052 --> 03:33:44.794]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[03:33:44.794 --> 03:33:45.574]  We survived.
[03:33:46.514 --> 03:33:47.915]  But we were wounded.
[03:33:47.915 --> 03:33:58.765]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, all of them pulled or froze Jones' accounts on the grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly.
[03:33:58.765 --> 03:34:01.847]  InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[03:34:01.847 --> 03:34:05.411]  Obviously what he views is hate and it's important.
[03:34:05.411 --> 03:34:08.613]  We have crossed the Rubicon and there is no turning back.
[03:34:09.894 --> 03:34:13.196]  We must push through to victory.
[03:34:13.196 --> 03:34:18.059]  And so now more than ever, we need your support.
[03:34:18.059 --> 03:34:22.881]  Our products at Infowarsstore.com are like war bonds.
[03:34:22.881 --> 03:34:25.723]  Make a purchase today and support the fight.
[03:34:27.479 --> 03:34:31.545]  There is now open talk of repealing the Second Amendment.
[03:34:31.545 --> 03:34:36.953]  The NRA is being designated as a terrorist organization.
[03:34:36.953 --> 03:34:41.620]  People are being arrested for personal opinions they post online.
[03:34:43.042 --> 03:34:48.127]  We will continue to question everything and fight until the end.
[03:34:48.127 --> 03:34:51.731]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and keep the fight alive.
[03:34:51.731 --> 03:34:55.355]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[03:34:55.355 --> 03:34:57.097]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[03:34:57.097 --> 03:34:58.959]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[03:34:58.959 --> 03:35:00.721]  He's specifically calling you out.
[03:35:02.799 --> 03:35:05.180]  What is your take watching all of this?
[03:35:05.180 --> 03:35:08.462]  A, and then B, the big news, U.S.
[03:35:08.462 --> 03:35:15.145]  Attorney recommends prosecuting and proceeding with charges against McCabe, which means it's going to happen.
[03:35:15.145 --> 03:35:16.285]  We'll break that down in a moment.
[03:35:16.285 --> 03:35:17.126]  This is huge, Millie.
[03:35:18.030 --> 03:35:19.671]  Oh yeah, this is huge news.
[03:35:19.671 --> 03:35:24.394]  It's a great revelation as far as draining the swamp.
[03:35:24.394 --> 03:35:26.816]  This is great news as far as McCabe goes.
[03:35:26.816 --> 03:35:30.178]  Now, I want to talk a little bit about the debates right now.
[03:35:30.178 --> 03:35:36.862]  We know that there's kind of a three-way battle going on between Warren, Biden, and Sanders.
[03:35:37.601 --> 03:35:43.686]  Biden right now they say has the leads in the polls, but the polls aren't very trusting anyway.
[03:35:43.686 --> 03:35:46.689]  We know that Warren has actually done very well this summer.
[03:35:46.689 --> 03:35:57.178]  She's actually been the only Democratic candidate that has been continually accelerating as far as her polling numbers and her money raising as well.
[03:35:57.936 --> 03:36:07.322]  And when I was at the last Democrat debate, I talked to a Democrat insider off-record, and they were basically saying, look at the money.
[03:36:07.322 --> 03:36:08.862]  They said, look at the money.
[03:36:08.862 --> 03:36:17.928]  That is how you can tell who's actually really running, and then who's just running so that they can promote themselves for another year in office.
[03:36:18.888 --> 03:36:21.650]  Sure, who's just doing it for publicity and who's serious?
[03:36:21.650 --> 03:36:25.372]  I've seen reports the Trump administration is worried about Warren.
[03:36:25.372 --> 03:36:26.813]  Do you think that's actually the case?
[03:36:26.813 --> 03:36:27.994]  And then we'll get Barnes's take.
[03:36:29.167 --> 03:36:29.627]  I do.
[03:36:29.627 --> 03:36:37.772]  I think that Warren actually, she doesn't get as much of the flack that Bernie Sanders gets for her socialist, communist policies.
[03:36:37.772 --> 03:36:42.915]  But many Democrat socialists actually say that she's just Bernie Sanders with a plan.
[03:36:42.915 --> 03:36:44.496]  So her policies are very similar.
[03:36:44.496 --> 03:36:46.817]  You can see today, she speaks radically.
[03:36:46.817 --> 03:36:52.481]  She talks about Medicare for everyone, free college, free this, free that.
[03:36:52.481 --> 03:36:57.163]  I mean, she really wants to hand out those Democrat bucks to everyone.
[03:36:57.163 --> 03:36:58.264]  It almost seems like this is a
[03:36:58.624 --> 03:37:03.192]  A competition to see who can promise everyone the most free stuff.
[03:37:03.192 --> 03:37:03.953]  It's ridiculous.
[03:37:03.953 --> 03:37:09.101]  Even Beto earlier, ABC was running a special where Beto sat down with
[03:37:09.767 --> 03:37:10.968]  We're good to go.
[03:37:31.838 --> 03:37:34.319]  So, this is socialism that they want.
[03:37:34.319 --> 03:37:37.461]  So, I mean, I don't think, I think Trump wants the Democratic Party to believe he's afraid of Elizabeth Warren.
[03:37:49.307 --> 03:37:49.527]  Absolutely.
[03:37:49.527 --> 03:37:50.548]  I'm going to go back to that moment.
[03:37:50.548 --> 03:37:51.289]  I'm just noticing something here.
[03:38:12.130 --> 03:38:13.771]  Let's go back to Sanders.
[03:38:13.771 --> 03:38:14.372]  They just cut away.
[03:38:14.372 --> 03:38:16.073]  They're giving Sanders most of the time.
[03:38:16.073 --> 03:38:18.434]  Supposed to be Warren and Biden.
[03:38:18.434 --> 03:38:19.775]  Sanders is really dominating.
[03:38:19.775 --> 03:38:21.857]  They just cut away, but I've been watching.
[03:38:21.857 --> 03:38:23.498]  He's gotten the most time so far.
[03:38:23.498 --> 03:38:26.139]  Biden seems to be sitting there kind of wood carving.
[03:38:26.139 --> 03:38:33.524]  Well, our prediction was that two people to bet on, one was Julian Castro, and the other one was to bet on Bernie.
[03:38:33.524 --> 03:38:34.865]  You said that today on my show.
[03:38:34.865 --> 03:38:35.145]  Exactly.
[03:38:35.145 --> 03:38:35.886]  Well, that was a lie.
[03:38:35.886 --> 03:38:36.766]  Why is he taking over?
[03:38:36.766 --> 03:38:39.208]  They're all addressing him like he's the real leader.
[03:38:39.208 --> 03:38:40.269]  It's happening right now.
[03:38:40.689 --> 03:38:47.494]  Because it's his health care bill and he wants to talk about it the most and shut out Warren and show himself as the true believer of the cause.
[03:38:47.494 --> 03:38:48.755]  And so it's smarter Bernie.
[03:38:48.755 --> 03:38:57.482]  Bernie knows he needs to continue to project through these debates dominance on policy to replace Warren amongst his, particularly his college students.
[03:38:57.482 --> 03:39:07.710]  Now it's time to develop something kind of like what Judicial Watch has done with FOIA requests, but even stronger and then also that advocates for people's speech.
[03:39:07.710 --> 03:39:08.571]  And you've won.
[03:39:09.071 --> 03:39:11.593]  Hundreds and hundreds of major cases.
[03:39:11.593 --> 03:39:13.355]  And you've got your Covington suits.
[03:39:13.355 --> 03:39:14.896]  Yours haven't been thrown out like the others.
[03:39:14.896 --> 03:39:19.020]  You predicted those others would be thrown out and were, you know, obviously that...
[03:39:21.169 --> 03:39:23.270]  We're talking about is what a lot of that had the smell of.
[03:39:23.270 --> 03:39:32.014]  But regardless, we're blazing a path with really good lawsuits that are going to help the state attorney generals and help the president, who we know our information is getting to.
[03:39:32.014 --> 03:39:33.475]  And we're leading by example.
[03:39:33.475 --> 03:39:37.236]  And you said months ago, let's wait till the states act in coordination with the president.
[03:39:37.236 --> 03:39:38.617]  We now know he's coordinating that.
[03:39:38.617 --> 03:39:39.337]  So this is the move.
[03:39:39.337 --> 03:39:48.741]  So speak to the president's coordination and how he's finally taking action and how this ties into the first FBI director ever that they've announced he will be indicted.
[03:39:48.741 --> 03:39:50.002]  I mean, that is happening.
[03:39:50.442 --> 03:40:00.404]  We need to break that down as well for a few minutes here, but then also talk about that vacuum that the ACLU is not actually filling anymore.
[03:40:00.404 --> 03:40:00.764]  Exactly.
[03:40:00.764 --> 03:40:04.705]  I mean, what's happened is we need a counterpart to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:40:04.705 --> 03:40:11.427]  We need the ACLU for everybody, for people on the political right, not just people with political beliefs on the left.
[03:40:11.787 --> 03:40:15.028]  The ACLU has abandoned free speech in most contexts.
[03:40:15.028 --> 03:40:19.189]  In fact, they're constantly calling for censorship now in a wide range of areas.
[03:40:19.189 --> 03:40:25.150]  So there's no legal organization out there to support people that are part of their independence or on the right.
[03:40:25.150 --> 03:40:30.311]  Politically, they're standing up for issues related to life, related to speech, related to opposing war.
[03:40:30.311 --> 03:40:34.052]  Those are the voices they're seeking to suppress and to censor.
[03:40:34.052 --> 03:40:38.673]  And that's why there needs to be legal remedies and legal rights protected of those Americans.
[03:40:39.113 --> 03:40:42.315]  And so the point of Free American Law Center is to substitute in for that.
[03:40:42.315 --> 03:40:47.379]  Now the left has had a long-standing institutional advantage in the legal arena.
[03:40:47.379 --> 03:40:50.321]  Because one, a lot of liberals, a lot of lawyers lean left.
[03:40:50.321 --> 03:40:51.342]  That's part of the bias.
[03:40:51.342 --> 03:40:54.084]  A lot of the judiciary leans left on a range of issues.
[03:40:54.084 --> 03:40:56.565]  The sort of establishment liberals on a range of issues.
[03:40:56.565 --> 03:40:59.828]  That allows the left to have an advantage institutionally.
[03:40:59.828 --> 03:41:05.792]  But one critical component is the left often gives and contributes to legal organizations simply to feel good for themselves.
[03:41:06.312 --> 03:41:08.173]  So, and feel good about themselves.
[03:41:08.173 --> 03:41:09.813]  People on the right generally have not.
[03:41:09.813 --> 03:41:11.574]  They generally want something in return.
[03:41:11.574 --> 03:41:14.695]  That makes the people on the right uniquely good business people.
[03:41:14.695 --> 03:41:19.776]  But it has disabled and handicapped the political right in the legal arena.
[03:41:19.776 --> 03:41:24.397]  In the lawfare arena, the left... And it's allowed the left to take over every institution.
[03:41:24.397 --> 03:41:25.558]  So if you want to be their slaves...
[03:41:26.218 --> 03:41:28.461]  Don't contribute to this organization.
[03:41:28.461 --> 03:41:31.844]  Don't buy products at InfoWarsTore.com because you want fighters?
[03:41:31.844 --> 03:41:32.545]  Bob's doing it.
[03:41:32.545 --> 03:41:33.326]  I'm doing it.
[03:41:33.326 --> 03:41:34.367]  This crew's doing it.
[03:41:34.367 --> 03:41:35.409]  We're swinging for the fences.
[03:41:35.409 --> 03:41:37.791]  We've already had devastating victories against the globalists.
[03:41:37.791 --> 03:41:45.080]  And so we're the place for you to bet your money and bet your future together at InfoWarsTore.com and FreeAmericanLawCenter.com.
[03:41:45.640 --> 03:41:47.361]  Free America Law Center.
[03:41:47.361 --> 03:41:54.125]  We started Free America Law Center because we needed a counterpart to the ACLU and to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:41:54.125 --> 03:41:59.868]  Organizations that have been legal support organizations for political causes on the left for a long time.
[03:41:59.868 --> 03:42:07.012]  But many ordinary Americans, many people on the political right or political independents, did not have that same opportunity afforded them.
[03:42:07.012 --> 03:42:10.154]  So we created the Free America Law Center to help fight back.
[03:42:10.774 --> 03:42:23.742]  Fight back particularly in the areas of big tech deplatforming, big media defamation, big government deep state whistleblowers who need protection against the institutional powers of the establishment.
[03:42:23.742 --> 03:42:27.424]  That's why we created the Free America Law Center to empower you.
[03:42:27.424 --> 03:42:37.871]  You are creating equal access and democratizing the law so that ordinary everyday Americans can fight back against big tech, big media, and big powerful institutions out to deprive them of their rights.
[03:42:38.733 --> 03:42:43.511]  Find out more at FreeAmericaLawCenter.com where you can become a member today.
[03:42:51.761 --> 03:42:54.724]  Happies is a tincture that you take under the tongue.
[03:42:54.724 --> 03:42:56.706]  They've been selling it for over a year.
[03:42:56.706 --> 03:43:03.874]  It's a private label of one of the top national sellers of herbs that's known to calm the body, but not be a depressant.
[03:43:03.874 --> 03:43:09.160]  Now, despite the fact that I've never really promoted or cut an ad for it, it's in our top 10 bestsellers.
[03:43:09.160 --> 03:43:12.724]  And right now, for those of you that haven't tried it, you can get it for 50% off.
[03:43:14.065 --> 03:43:15.245]  Life is stressful.
[03:43:15.245 --> 03:43:18.147]  Almost everything in our lives can put stress and pressure on us.
[03:43:18.147 --> 03:43:29.351]  But ashwagandha root, rhodiola root, passionflower herb, green tea leaf, and licorice root is known to be so good for us and to smooth us out in a calm, good way and happy,
[03:43:29.411 --> 03:43:29.731]  I think so.
[03:43:51.966 --> 03:43:57.708]  Super Silver Wound Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[03:43:57.708 --> 03:44:02.429]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over the counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[03:44:02.429 --> 03:44:05.911]  We have been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years.
[03:44:05.911 --> 03:44:07.291]  It's been a bestseller.
[03:44:07.291 --> 03:44:18.835]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there at a lower price with their patented Silver Sol technology in it.
[03:44:19.295 --> 03:44:28.945]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the stearic acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil, it's got the nano silver coconut oil and so much more.
[03:44:28.945 --> 03:44:34.211]  It's in two sizes, super silver skin cream in 3.4 ounce and in the smaller one
[03:44:34.471 --> 03:44:38.637]  You're not going to find a product this good anywhere, and you're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[03:44:38.637 --> 03:44:42.402]  And it funds the InfoWar at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:44:42.402 --> 03:44:45.406]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[03:44:45.406 --> 03:44:49.712]  We can only run this special for another week or so, as of taping this September 10th.
[03:44:52.796 --> 03:45:00.224]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you, the products at Infowarslife.com are.
[03:45:00.224 --> 03:45:13.519]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[03:45:14.019 --> 03:45:20.664]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[03:45:20.664 --> 03:45:22.445]  It sells itself.
[03:45:22.445 --> 03:45:31.351]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[03:45:31.351 --> 03:45:32.552]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[03:45:33.072 --> 03:45:45.421]  Well, BODY'S Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, and it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[03:45:45.421 --> 03:45:48.803]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[03:45:48.803 --> 03:45:52.326]  50% off on BODY'S at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:45:52.326 --> 03:46:00.412]  As I sit here recording this on the eve of September 11th, 2019, and I look back to that tragic event 18 years ago,
[03:46:01.795 --> 03:46:15.822]  It makes me sick to my stomach to be vindicated and have the Fire Department of New York and major construction and engineering firms come out and confirm that bombs were in Tower 1, Tower 2, and of course Building 7.
[03:46:15.822 --> 03:46:17.984]  It's just pancakes.
[03:46:17.984 --> 03:46:25.648]  And that then FBI Director Robert Mueller helped cover the whole thing up with the Saudis and to know that there's a deep state group
[03:46:26.408 --> 03:46:38.194]  Working within our government with radical Islam, who are using the threat of Islamic terror to take our basic liberties and freedoms, while empowering and funding radical Islam to take over the planet.
[03:46:38.194 --> 03:46:47.819]  Well, 18 years later, I'm here to tell you that the world is awake at 9-11, and InfoWars, and our researchers, and our guests, and our whistleblowers have been vindicated yet again.
[03:46:47.819 --> 03:46:50.020]  That's why InfoWars.com is more important than ever.
[03:46:55.569 --> 03:47:09.213]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:09.213 --> 03:47:16.154]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[03:47:16.154 --> 03:47:18.235]  You better believe you've got one!
[03:47:20.458 --> 03:47:25.356]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:53.101 --> 03:48:11.221]  As more of these Democrat cities are getting more violent, when they can't sign gun control legislation to take away your Second Amendment right, the more and more violence, like for example here in Austin, there was a place I like to go get lunch around here, and the owner of the restaurant noticed my
[03:48:12.520 --> 03:48:12.620]  Yeah.
[03:48:43.629 --> 03:48:44.970]  The more people are going to get guns.
[03:48:44.970 --> 03:48:47.792]  We just saw a 15% surge in gun sales.
[03:48:47.792 --> 03:48:58.080]  So the more and more the left is promoting this anti-gun agenda, yet the more and more their cities that they run are getting more violent, the more and more people are getting guns.
[03:48:58.080 --> 03:49:01.002]  The equation does not add up for the Democrats.
[03:49:01.002 --> 03:49:03.384]  Yeah, you're going to have people that want to turn their guns in and be slaves.
[03:49:03.384 --> 03:49:05.485]  I guess you'll have that in every population.
[03:49:05.485 --> 03:49:09.829]  But the popular opinion is the Second Amendment's in.
[03:49:10.706 --> 03:49:12.027]  And hey, guess what?
[03:49:12.027 --> 03:49:15.050]  If you want to get rid of your guns, you don't need the government to help you do that.
[03:49:15.050 --> 03:49:16.231]  You can just get rid of your guns.
[03:49:16.231 --> 03:49:18.273]  If you feel guilty, you can give them to me.
[03:49:18.273 --> 03:49:19.694]  Give them to us.
[03:49:19.694 --> 03:49:24.117]  Yeah, yeah, I don't need a volunteer take back.
[03:49:24.117 --> 03:49:28.341]  Hey, if you're out there and you want to get rid of your gun, you can send them to me.
[03:49:28.341 --> 03:49:29.282]  I'll be happy to take them.
[03:49:29.282 --> 03:49:30.163]  Oh, I'm stealing this.
[03:49:30.163 --> 03:49:31.504]  I'm stealing this right now.
[03:49:31.504 --> 03:49:33.325]  I'm putting it on Twitter first.
[03:49:33.325 --> 03:49:35.247]  If you want to get rid of them.
[03:49:35.927 --> 03:49:38.248]  Let me see if I can beat you too.
[03:49:38.248 --> 03:49:39.709]  I'll be happy to take your gun.
[03:49:39.709 --> 03:49:52.294]  If you really want to get rid of it, you have the AR-15, you have the AK-47, whatever it is, your Beretta, your 9mm, your .38, whatever it is, you want to get rid of it, by all means, send it to me.
[03:49:52.294 --> 03:49:55.595]  I'll be happy to take it off your liberal hands.
[03:49:55.595 --> 03:49:55.975]  You know what?
[03:49:55.975 --> 03:49:58.857]  Well, I think I'm less picky than you because I'll take a high point.
[03:49:58.857 --> 03:50:01.438]  Whatever people want to get rid of, you know where to send it.
[03:50:01.438 --> 03:50:04.199]  Any three of us will happily, happily disarm you.
[03:50:04.764 --> 03:50:06.945]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[03:50:06.945 --> 03:50:09.205]  We will happily disarm you, I like that.
[03:50:09.205 --> 03:50:10.405]  Let me say this, let me say this.
[03:50:10.405 --> 03:50:18.087]  You know what, the Democrats, I think, this is my true, this is why I truly believe that they're going after gun control.
[03:50:18.087 --> 03:50:27.710]  One, because after the Civil War, it was gun control that they wanted to implement so black people could not be able to protect themselves from the Democratic KKK.
[03:50:28.450 --> 03:50:36.957]  Because after the Civil War, the NRA teamed up with the Republicans to arm black people to protect themselves from these people that wanted to harm them and kill them.
[03:50:36.957 --> 03:50:39.078]  So then, the Democrats got upset.
[03:50:39.078 --> 03:50:46.504]  So I think it's a personal vendetta against the NRA, all of these years, with the Democrats.
[03:50:49.062 --> 03:50:52.564]  Finally, get the NRA under their boot.
[03:50:52.564 --> 03:50:54.065]  They will do so.
[03:50:54.065 --> 03:50:58.167]  But this has been a personal vendetta all these years, and they're not letting it go.
[03:50:58.167 --> 03:51:03.389]  Because they help black people, and because they help black people, that is the main problem here.
[03:51:03.389 --> 03:51:10.493]  Well, and actually the second biggest gun group is the National African American Association of Rifle Owners or something, I forget what it is.
[03:51:11.189 --> 03:51:18.661]  Yeah, I saw somebody was tweeting out like, well, you know, us black and brown people, we'll go out and buy guns and then we'll see how fast the law changed.
[03:51:18.661 --> 03:51:20.063]  And it's like, wow, you really misunderstand.
[03:51:20.063 --> 03:51:21.365]  That's Dave Chappelle's big joke.
[03:51:22.031 --> 03:51:24.433]  Yeah, Dave Chappelle, which is absolutely disgusting.
[03:51:24.433 --> 03:51:27.696]  He says, what are we going to have to do to get white people to get rid of their guns?
[03:51:27.696 --> 03:51:28.257]  Oh, I know.
[03:51:28.257 --> 03:51:31.740]  Let's get all the black people to get guns and then whites will take guns from blacks.
[03:51:31.740 --> 03:51:33.142]  No, you absolute moron.
[03:51:33.142 --> 03:51:36.845]  The Democrats want your guns so you can continue to be a victim.
[03:51:36.845 --> 03:51:38.046]  That's the whole point in this.
[03:51:38.046 --> 03:51:38.567]  Go ahead.
[03:51:38.567 --> 03:51:39.027]  Get a gun.
[03:51:39.027 --> 03:51:40.308]  Defend yourself from whitey.
[03:51:40.308 --> 03:51:42.751]  Whatever you, whatever excuse you want to have, go get a gun.
[03:51:43.251 --> 03:51:44.152]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:51:44.152 --> 03:51:47.656]  And that's the big misunderstanding is they're like, oh, we'll go get guns now.
[03:51:47.656 --> 03:51:49.658]  And we're like, okay, good, great.
[03:51:49.658 --> 03:51:50.439]  No, oh my God.
[03:51:50.439 --> 03:51:52.842]  We've actually, this is it.
[03:51:52.842 --> 03:51:58.348]  We've just defeated, we can now use the left ideology against them.
[03:51:58.348 --> 03:51:59.950]  I'm so scared of white people.
[03:51:59.950 --> 03:52:00.431]  I need a gun.
[03:52:02.369 --> 03:52:11.191]  Like, no, no, no, seriously, like, guys, I've seen it on CNN, I've seen it, white terrorists are everywhere, and they're just trying to murder everybody.
[03:52:11.191 --> 03:52:12.431]  White people are out of control.
[03:52:12.431 --> 03:52:15.772]  I need a gun to protect myself from the white people that are out of control in this country.
[03:52:15.772 --> 03:52:24.874]  And if the Democrats dare take my gun when white people are running around killing people left and right in the streets every day, I heard it on CNN, well then, I'll be damned!
[03:52:24.874 --> 03:52:28.535]  I need to protect myself from whitey, I saw it on CNN, this is unbelievable!
[03:52:28.875 --> 03:52:29.696]  That's exactly right.
[03:52:29.696 --> 03:52:38.443]  You look at that Democratic stage, you see all those white people trying to push gun control to disarm those black people so white people can victimize them.
[03:52:38.443 --> 03:52:39.785]  That is exactly right.
[03:52:39.785 --> 03:52:45.089]  Very good stuff.
[03:52:45.089 --> 03:52:50.474]  Comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, number one.
[03:52:50.474 --> 03:52:55.058]  We didn't lock people up in cages, we didn't separate families, we didn't do all of those things.
[03:52:55.714 --> 03:53:02.560]  Joe Biden, they're defending President Obama's immigration policies while launching accusations at the Trump team.
[03:53:02.560 --> 03:53:08.264]  Yet again, let's bring in Customs and Border Protection Deputy Commissioner Robert Perez.
[03:53:08.264 --> 03:53:10.466]  Thank you very much for talking to us.
[03:53:10.466 --> 03:53:14.630]  Biden's claims there that Obama didn't lock people up in cages is simply untrue.
[03:53:15.390 --> 03:53:20.419]  And this false narrative is no different than what other Democrats have been incorrectly saying for months now.
[03:53:20.419 --> 03:53:26.750]  And I'm not going to ask you to analyze last night's debate, but the cages were built by the Obama administration in 2014, not Trump.
[03:53:26.750 --> 03:53:26.971]  Correct?
[03:53:29.585 --> 03:53:32.528]  Well thanks for having me Julie, and that is correct.
[03:53:32.528 --> 03:53:51.188]  Look, what I can tell you by virtue of nearly 27 years of experience and being a career law enforcement professional is this, is that the challenges and the loopholes to the legal framework that have been fueling first the border security crisis, that evolved into a humanitarian crisis, have been present through
[03:53:51.408 --> 03:53:56.311]  Through several administrations, not just the last two, in some cases even beyond that.
[03:53:56.311 --> 03:54:10.200]  And so, over the last year, as you know, we've taken some unprecedented steps to deal the best we can within the confines of this legal framework over the last few months, particularly with working with our colleagues in Mexico and others.
[03:54:10.200 --> 03:54:16.283]  And we've made some real inroads into what is and continues to be a broken legal framework.
[03:54:16.283 --> 03:54:18.645]  Look, Julie, Congress just got back in town.
[03:54:19.065 --> 03:54:25.911]  It is time for them to get to work with us to find lasting solutions to this ongoing challenge.
[03:54:25.911 --> 03:54:29.254]  Make no mistake about it, however, we're going to continue to do all we can.
[03:54:29.254 --> 03:54:40.223]  We're going to continue to build as much border wall to deal with that border security crisis, to be able to deal with the criminals, the drug smugglers, the gangsters and the like who try to evade capture.
[03:54:40.663 --> 03:54:40.923]  We're good.
[03:55:01.024 --> 03:55:16.323]  We're using Trump's zero tolerance policy in talking about family separations by showing video photos taken in 2014 at a Customs and Border Protection facility in Arizona, showing that the cages were actually during the Obama years.
[03:55:16.323 --> 03:55:18.585]  Cages are not being used now, let's be clear.
[03:55:18.585 --> 03:55:20.448]  Let's talk about what is being used.
[03:55:22.109 --> 03:55:32.052]  So, Julie, look, our colleagues in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, they are the primary agency charged with longer-term detention.
[03:55:32.052 --> 03:55:42.395]  We at Customs and Border Protection, and specifically and particularly the Border Patrol, both at our ports of entry and in those stations, are really short-term holding facilities.
[03:55:42.395 --> 03:55:43.716]  We've been saying that for months.
[03:55:44.396 --> 03:55:48.878]  As everybody knows, over the course of the summer, they became absolutely oversaturated.
[03:55:48.878 --> 03:55:52.580]  These are facilities that were never meant to hold people long-term.
[03:55:52.580 --> 03:56:09.709]  Nonetheless, well, we've taken our unprecedented steps to build soft-sided facilities to increase that capacity, and when and while we were having to hold people longer in our custody, take the best of care that we possibly could to them, to create more room for them, and in, for example, also
[03:56:10.149 --> 03:56:11.410]  We're good to go.
[03:56:28.877 --> 03:56:31.179]  Alright, we just got August numbers of U.S.
[03:56:31.179 --> 03:56:34.141]  Border Patrol Southwest border apprehensions.
[03:56:34.141 --> 03:56:35.843]  And those numbers are down.
[03:56:35.843 --> 03:56:36.423]  Take a look.
[03:56:36.423 --> 03:56:36.804]  August 50,693.
[03:56:36.804 --> 03:56:37.785]  Down 20,000 from July at 71.
[03:56:37.785 --> 03:56:39.326]  And then another 20,000 away in June at 94.
[03:56:39.326 --> 03:56:39.966]  And back in May, 132,000.
[03:56:39.966 --> 03:56:40.787]  These numbers have come down.
[03:56:40.787 --> 03:56:42.248]  Could you explain to us why?
[03:56:53.886 --> 03:56:55.207]  Absolutely, Julie.
[03:56:55.207 --> 03:57:11.722]  So what we've realized is the unprecedented, again, agreement with Mexico, that needs to be mentioned first, where they have deployed over 25,000 of their National Guard at their southern border with Guatemala, throughout their interior, and along our shared border with them.
[03:57:12.322 --> 03:57:21.047]  We continue to share information and intelligence on the threats and how the alien smuggling organizations are functioning to stop that flow from ever reaching.
[03:57:21.047 --> 03:57:28.532]  And we're collaborating with them with programs like the Migrant Protection Protocol, which we're expanding with some dedicated facilities for those programs.
[03:57:28.532 --> 03:57:33.875]  That is part of the real difference that has made, that we've realized in the last few months.
[03:57:33.875 --> 03:57:35.376]  But we're still in a crisis, Julie.
[03:57:35.376 --> 03:57:40.699]  It's still both border security and humanitarian by virtue of what we're seeing, even last month.
