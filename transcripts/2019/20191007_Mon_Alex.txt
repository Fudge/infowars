[00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.326]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:12.948]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an emergency broadcast.
[00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:15.248]  It's October 7th, 2019.
[00:00:15.688 --> 00:00:22.990]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from the embattled InfoWars News Centers in Austin, Texas, broadcasting and transmitting worldwide.
[00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.950]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:30.371]  I come to you from not in my normal broadcast chair.
[00:00:31.412 --> 00:00:33.372]  I come to you standing up on my feet.
[00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:40.267]  To basically highlight the fact that this country is in such a crisis and is at such a crossroads.
[00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:52.192]  I was sitting here 10 minutes ago before we were going to go live on this Monday transmission and I thought, how after 25 years on air do I note to people how serious the situation is?
[00:00:52.813 --> 00:00:56.274]  And I thought, well, how about you do most of the show today on your feet?
[00:00:56.934 --> 00:01:00.116]  Because that way it'll get you into the mental mode that we're not in.
[00:01:01.055 --> 00:01:02.716]  The normal political season anymore.
[00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:26.014]  We're in a time where criminals, where terrorists are terrorizing the American people, holding the economy hostage, trying to cause mass shootings, trying to cause race war, and trying to remove our duly elected president because they have hijacked the nation and have been selling it out for decades and have sold us out of the shy comms and others and are angry and don't want us to take back control of our country.
[00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.977]  These are the stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:31.783]  And I've read the Marine Corps
[00:01:55.777 --> 00:01:58.918]  Order and I've talked to Marine Corps retired officers and others.
[00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:01.159]  This is unprecedented.
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.181]  You can read the full order at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:14.685]  For those thinking it's not real, you just simply click on the InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com article and you'll be at the MarineCorps.mil website.
[00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:21.568]  Google and Facebook and Twitter are trying to block it when you share this .mil link.
[00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:24.489]  Now it's the Marines that protect the President.
[00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.692]  This is talking about for civil emergency and the civil authorities.
[00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:30.354]  This is unprecedented in this lengthy order.
[00:02:30.374 --> 00:02:32.936]  We're going to be going over it here with you today.
[00:02:32.956 --> 00:02:33.416]  But there it is.
[00:02:33.476 --> 00:02:41.602]  Manpower Guidance for Activation and Deactivation of Reserve Component Marines Ordered to Active Duty ISO Defense Support of Civil Authorities.
[00:02:42.163 --> 00:02:43.884]  That was signed four days ago.
[00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:44.765]  Got no attention.
[00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:50.407]  Until NaturalNews.com and Mike Adams and Infowars.com and myself put out an article yesterday.
[00:02:50.447 --> 00:02:53.088]  Mike Adams will be here in the third hour today.
[00:02:53.468 --> 00:03:00.531]  Now remember, we're in a climate where the President says we're in a civil war and there is a deep state coup against the election and against the people.
[00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:02.432]  That's the truth.
[00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:11.656]  Now they've had Phil Mudd, former Deputy Director of the CIA, who ran assassination programs, go on TV and say they're going to kill Trump and they're going to stab him and Giuliani in the back.
[00:03:12.688 --> 00:03:18.211]  We played all the clips on the Sunday show of them on the different news shows saying, prison's too good for him.
[00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:25.476]  We want to put him in solitary confinement or we're going to kill him and we're going to kill his family and we're going to kill the cabinet.
[00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:33.961]  And they're talking about what prisons, Tlaib and AOC and all of these evil demons are openly frothing at the mouth how they want to butcher this country.
[00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:35.922]  The left is trying to cause race wars.
[00:03:36.722 --> 00:03:38.684]  It's in all of their admitted documents.
[00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:41.006]  We're going to be breaking it all down.
[00:03:41.046 --> 00:03:49.990]  I have to tell you, Tucker Carlson, I believe, is the best person on TV for his understanding of things, his deep grasp of things.
[00:03:50.931 --> 00:04:00.455]  And he did a piece, I guess an emergency weekend report he did, that is so powerful that we're going to air it at the start of the next segment.
[00:04:01.263 --> 00:04:05.845]  Dealing with how the deep state is holding America hostage, how they're threatening to kill people that don't submit.
[00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:06.866]  These are terrorists.
[00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:09.367]  In fact, please print me the definition of terrorism.
[00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:14.689]  It's to threaten violence or carry out violence for a political aim.
[00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:24.154]  And when you have all these people threatening to destroy the economy, threatening to cause race wars, threatening to kill the president, attacking all the supporters of lawsuits and threats, going to their houses,
[00:04:25.174 --> 00:04:26.975]  I'm here to tell you you're a damn terrorist.
[00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:29.035]  And we're going to stand against you.
[00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:32.976]  Yeah, your Joker movie hasn't triggered the mass shootings you want yet, but I went and saw it.
[00:04:33.076 --> 00:04:34.837]  It's a worship of anti-fund mass death.
[00:04:35.517 --> 00:04:38.538]  And they even admit in the studies that Hollywood's trying to cause mass shootings.
[00:04:38.758 --> 00:04:39.818]  You're a bunch of criminals.
[00:04:39.858 --> 00:04:41.679]  You love killing babies when they're already born.
[00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.660]  Everyone knows you're a bunch of demonic scum that thinks they've conquered us.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.900]  But you haven't filth!
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.121]  Trump has called out the Marines.
[00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:48.581]  Stay with us.
[00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:50.961]  Huge massive developments.
[00:04:51.261 --> 00:04:52.522]  Report to you on this October 7th.
[00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:55.986]  2019 Monday broadcast.
[00:04:56.126 --> 00:04:57.546]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:04:58.686 --> 00:05:03.748]  Tucker Carlson this weekend put out a report that is devastatingly accurate.
[00:05:04.148 --> 00:05:05.148]  Total Veritas.
[00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:11.290]  That's why now he is their number two enemy in media to be taken off the air only after yours truly.
[00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.551]  And by the way, I don't say that with pleasure.
[00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:17.292]  It's not good to be hunted like this, but when you're over the target, that's what happens.
[00:05:17.632 --> 00:05:19.973]  We're going to go to his incredible report here in a moment.
[00:05:21.283 --> 00:05:22.204]  I want to explain something.
[00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:26.006]  I've made calls to folks I know in the military who are officers.
[00:05:26.807 --> 00:05:35.092]  I've made calls to folks that I know that are Marines, who are retired, who are officers, and they say absolutely that this is serious and unprecedented.
[00:05:35.612 --> 00:05:35.853]  U.S.
[00:05:35.893 --> 00:05:42.177]  Marine Reserve units activated for emergency within the United States, which will come with little warning, sights, threats.
[00:05:42.797 --> 00:05:47.341]  In the homeland, that's InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, NaturalNews.com.
[00:05:47.401 --> 00:05:48.041]  Originally broke it.
[00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:48.982]  We consulted with them.
[00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:49.723]  U.S.
[00:05:49.743 --> 00:05:54.627]  Marine Reserve units activated for emergency within the United States, which will come a little warning, cites threats to the homeland.
[00:05:54.887 --> 00:05:57.149]  Now, why is that so important?
[00:05:59.171 --> 00:06:03.414]  I had dinner with a very close Trump confidant right after Trump got into office.
[00:06:04.655 --> 00:06:10.480]  And this individual had just had dinner a few days before in Mar-a-Lago, a two-hour private dinner with the president.
[00:06:13.976 --> 00:06:17.720]  And Trump was very fatalistic and said, I'm not going to back down.
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.562]  It was pure bull.
[00:06:19.582 --> 00:06:20.643]  They never thought he would win.
[00:06:21.804 --> 00:06:34.777]  And he said that if they try to remove him extrajudicially, the 22nd Amendment, without doing a proper impeachment, that Trump intends to call out the Marines to, quote, encircle the White House.
[00:06:34.837 --> 00:06:35.638]  Now, I was told this.
[00:06:37.645 --> 00:06:40.026]  Almost three years ago, and I had my mouth hanging open.
[00:06:40.706 --> 00:06:44.028]  Then I talked to some other folks, and that is where Trump is.
[00:06:44.448 --> 00:06:47.629]  That's what Trump is prepared to do, and that's why the globalists are freaking out.
[00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.330]  Because they're a bunch of criminals that have hijacked this nation.
[00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:56.113]  They're literal terrorists, threatening to destroy the economy, to cause race wars, to trigger mass shootings.
[00:06:56.153 --> 00:07:04.856]  The studies show if we don't capitulate to their thought police, their attack on our children, their abortion factories, their killing babies after they're born, all their evil.
[00:07:05.316 --> 00:07:06.117]  So this shows
[00:07:06.937 --> 00:07:07.799]  How serious this is.
[00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:10.643]  Just like with Balazi Ford, they use one fake to bring forward more fakes.
[00:07:10.903 --> 00:07:12.586]  Now they've got more fake whistleblowers.
[00:07:12.847 --> 00:07:14.169]  The word is it's John Bolton.
[00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:20.959]  So the neocon globalist deep state run by Romney is making its move with the Democrats on Trump right now.
[00:07:22.538 --> 00:07:24.339]  And this could not be a more important broadcast.
[00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:25.540]  I'm going to lay out all the evidence.
[00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:37.329]  Democrats are all over the news with their talking point of how they're going to threaten Republicans and their families, just like I told you last week, until they make Trump resign or they're going to grab him and put him in a straitjacket under the 22nd Amendment.
[00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:40.212]  They're foaming at the mouth with their plans right now.
[00:07:42.854 --> 00:07:45.436]  And talking about how they're going to install Hillary or Pelosi.
[00:07:45.476 --> 00:07:46.917]  Now they're saying Hillary will run.
[00:07:47.257 --> 00:07:48.078]  That's all over the news.
[00:07:49.517 --> 00:07:52.630]  You've got Bannon coming out saying, well, where'd you hear it first?
[00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:53.534]  She's still planning that.
[00:07:54.462 --> 00:07:56.203]  And that's why she's got the impeachment rigged up.
[00:07:56.263 --> 00:07:59.045]  First, let's go to this very important report from Tucker Carlson.
[00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:26.322]  A little after 8 p.m.
[00:08:26.442 --> 00:08:31.343]  on the night of January 3rd, 2017, the President-elect wrote a tweet.
[00:08:32.164 --> 00:08:33.884]  He took a veiled dig at U.S.
[00:08:33.924 --> 00:08:38.945]  intelligence agencies for their handling of the then newly initiated Russia investigation.
[00:08:39.865 --> 00:08:47.247]  At pretty much the same moment, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York was arriving at MSNBC's Midtown Manhattan studios.
[00:08:48.052 --> 00:08:57.861]  He went to the set, and the anchor of the show he was on that night, Rachel Maddow, pulled up Trump's tweet on a screen, live on TV, and asked Chuck Schumer to comment on that tweet.
[00:08:58.601 --> 00:09:00.643]  Now, Schumer hadn't seen the tweet before, of course.
[00:09:00.683 --> 00:09:02.144]  He couldn't have known it was coming.
[00:09:02.745 --> 00:09:07.970]  For one of the most calculating politicians in Washington, it was a rare, unscripted moment.
[00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.875]  And so, for the first time in a long time, Chuck Schumer just went with the unvarnished truth.
[00:09:14.415 --> 00:09:15.036]  Watch what he said.
[00:09:16.314 --> 00:09:21.740]  Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:27.786]  So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[00:09:29.628 --> 00:09:38.217]  So, Schumer went on to say he didn't know exactly what the spy agencies would do to Donald Trump as punishment for being dumb enough to criticize them in public.
[00:09:38.898 --> 00:09:47.127]  But he warned, and this is a verbatim quote, from what I am told, they are very upset about how he has treated them and talked about them.
[00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:47.808]  End quote.
[00:09:48.368 --> 00:09:49.249]  Very upset.
[00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.170]  Got it?
[00:09:50.871 --> 00:09:52.352]  There's no mistaking what that was.
[00:09:52.872 --> 00:10:01.195]  That's a threat, issued on live television with grave seriousness by a politician who's been in Washington long enough to know that it's absolutely real.
[00:10:02.255 --> 00:10:05.977]  In the end, Donald Trump ignored it, or more likely, he decided to defy it.
[00:10:06.497 --> 00:10:15.100]  Day after day, he gave the finger to the permanent Washington establishment, often on Twitter, sometimes at press conferences, but always with unmistakable relish.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.042]  Trump acted like a man who'd won an election in a democratic country.
[00:10:19.642 --> 00:10:22.005]  He seemed to feel free to say exactly what he really thought.
[00:10:22.765 --> 00:10:26.990]  He didn't appear to believe that the intelligence agencies had veto power over his agenda.
[00:10:27.671 --> 00:10:31.555]  In a thousand different ways, the new president refused to bow.
[00:10:32.316 --> 00:10:38.142]  And for that crime, more than any other crime, he was punished, most recently by the manufactured Ukraine scandal.
[00:10:38.863 --> 00:10:41.486]  The intel world, meanwhile, has become increasingly defiant.
[00:10:42.046 --> 00:10:50.354]  Just yesterday, former CIA Director John Brennan expressed outrage that anyone would dare impose oversight on the intelligence agencies that secretly oversee our lives.
[00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:56.534]  I'm supposedly going to be interviewed by Mr. Durham as part of this non-investigation.
[00:10:57.095 --> 00:11:07.423]  I remember William Barr, you know, when he was testifying in front of Congress, he said he didn't understand the predication of the counterintelligence investigation that was launched into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
[00:11:07.963 --> 00:11:19.493]  I don't understand the predication of this worldwide effort to try to uncover dirt, either real or imagined, that would discredit that investigation in 2016 into Russian interference.
[00:11:21.192 --> 00:11:23.593]  John Brennan is a naked partisan, and he's a liar.
[00:11:24.273 --> 00:11:29.235]  He's acted in ways that would have shocked and horrified previous CIA directors, and that's saying a lot.
[00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:31.175]  But John Brennan is not ashamed.
[00:11:31.495 --> 00:11:31.955]  Far from it.
[00:11:31.995 --> 00:11:32.756]  He's proud.
[00:11:33.196 --> 00:11:35.457]  And so are his many acolytes in Washington.
[00:11:36.157 --> 00:11:38.017]  Phil Mudd is a former CIA employee.
[00:11:38.177 --> 00:11:42.039]  Like so many partisans from Intelligence World, he's now a contributor at CNN.
[00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:46.860]  Last night, Mudd sent an on-air warning to the President and his lawyer.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.521]  Back off, or prepare to get hurt.
[00:11:50.891 --> 00:11:52.472]  I spent a lot of time in government.
[00:11:52.832 --> 00:11:57.836]  There are State Department officials who will testify, intel guys, DOD, Department of Defense people.
[00:11:58.336 --> 00:12:00.357]  All of us are sort of a brotherhood and sisterhood.
[00:12:00.838 --> 00:12:03.459]  Rudy Giuliani parachutes in from Mars.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:10.644]  The people who will testify are going to look at him, including State Department officials, and say, I don't have to protect that guy.
[00:12:11.104 --> 00:12:12.705]  He didn't operate by the rules.
[00:12:13.026 --> 00:12:15.007]  He didn't do what you're supposed to do in government.
[00:12:15.427 --> 00:12:19.370]  I suspect he's worried about what the Congress will do if I were him.
[00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.896]  I'd be worried about whether people in government stick a shiv in his back.
[00:12:22.936 --> 00:12:23.577]  He's in trouble.
[00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:25.160]  Huh.
[00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:28.666]  So it's a brotherhood, says Phil Mudd, the CIA.
[00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:31.151]  A brotherhood that will stab you to death if you disobey.
[00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:36.228]  What Phil Mudd is describing is not a conventional government agency.
[00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:40.589]  It's nothing like what most of us imagine when we think about what Washington is doing on our behalf.
[00:12:41.409 --> 00:12:45.170]  The CIA of John Brennan and Phil Mudd does not exist for our benefit.
[00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.111]  It exists solely for the benefit of the people who work there.
[00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:53.752]  We pay for the whole thing, but they do what they want, and they punish anyone who criticizes them.
[00:12:53.972 --> 00:12:54.892]  They brag about that.
[00:12:56.173 --> 00:12:57.293]  Now that's scary, of course.
[00:12:57.353 --> 00:12:58.693]  It's a perversion of democracy.
[00:12:58.753 --> 00:13:01.354]  It's exactly what the people who created the CIA feared most.
[00:13:02.401 --> 00:13:03.722]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:13:03.822 --> 00:13:05.943]  It comes back and gets even more powerful.
[00:13:06.764 --> 00:13:09.786]  And if Tucker Carlson's wanting to get fired, this is how you do it.
[00:13:10.586 --> 00:13:12.007]  I know a little bit of the inside baseball.
[00:13:12.027 --> 00:13:15.329]  I'm not going to talk about it on air, but let's just say Tucker's got a lot of courage doing what he's doing.
[00:13:15.809 --> 00:13:21.733]  He's going up against murdering thugs that have hijacked this nation for 70 years and think they own it and think they own you.
[00:13:21.753 --> 00:13:22.774]  And they're a bunch of leftists.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.721]  I'm going to break some things down.
[00:13:24.781 --> 00:13:28.263]  These CIA guys running things, they haven't killed anybody, done anything.
[00:13:28.303 --> 00:13:29.284]  They hate the military.
[00:13:29.324 --> 00:13:30.565]  They hate the actual killers.
[00:13:30.905 --> 00:13:31.786]  They hate the patriots.
[00:13:32.226 --> 00:13:33.527]  They hate the people that actually do the work.
[00:13:33.927 --> 00:13:35.268]  They don't even associate with them.
[00:13:35.288 --> 00:13:39.831]  They eat lobsters and drink fine whiskey in armored bunkers while the troops go out and fight.
[00:13:40.431 --> 00:13:42.593]  They want to act like they're the big tough guys.
[00:13:42.953 --> 00:13:46.496]  Let me tell you, if things go sideways, these guys are all going to get wiped out by the people that
[00:13:47.287 --> 00:13:48.688]  Are watching them very, very closely.
[00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:50.570]  That's not a threat, that's a guarantee.
[00:13:51.031 --> 00:13:52.372]  Phil Mudd, all these people.
[00:13:52.412 --> 00:13:57.878]  Brennan are two inches away from being forced to walk the plank because they're so arrogant.
[00:13:57.918 --> 00:13:59.159]  They're going to lose this fight.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.181]  The question is how bad is it going to get?
[00:14:01.201 --> 00:14:03.964]  We're going to lay it all out coming up on the other side.
[00:14:04.305 --> 00:14:05.606]  History's happening right now.
[00:14:06.287 --> 00:14:09.450]  This criminal group knows they're all about to go to jail, so they're making their move on Trump.
[00:14:10.896 --> 00:14:14.439]  What do we do to make sure that we're all participants in saving this country?
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.722]  The decision is now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:16.742 --> 00:14:17.422]  History is now.
[00:14:17.843 --> 00:14:20.665]  I'm Alex Jones, newswars.com, infowars.com.
[00:14:20.685 --> 00:14:21.586]  Trump's called out the Marines.
[00:14:23.208 --> 00:14:26.631]  Welcome back on this live Monday, October 7th, 2019 transmission.
[00:14:26.671 --> 00:14:27.372]  The CIA, leftist arm of it,
[00:14:36.072 --> 00:14:42.234]  Has openly come out with a battle plan to shut down all conservatives and nationalists and defeat Trump in 2020.
[00:14:42.274 --> 00:14:44.774]  This is mainstream news.
[00:14:45.915 --> 00:14:47.055]  And I'm named.
[00:14:49.456 --> 00:14:51.336]  I mean, that's the type of stacks of news I have here.
[00:14:51.876 --> 00:14:53.337]  That's the Atlantic Council.
[00:14:54.277 --> 00:14:57.098]  They've got a new book out called Information Wars.
[00:14:59.218 --> 00:15:00.378]  And now I've got to be shut down.
[00:15:01.119 --> 00:15:02.479]  And now you've got to be shut up.
[00:15:04.198 --> 00:15:04.578]  We're good to go.
[00:15:35.129 --> 00:15:37.451]  A very, very exciting time to be alive.
[00:15:37.511 --> 00:15:42.035]  And here's Tucker Carlson with the number two biggest cable show in the world.
[00:15:44.077 --> 00:15:45.559]  Seen in over 160 countries.
[00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:58.551]  Laying out how people from the CIA, former deputy director, is saying they're going to kill the president, kill Giuliani.
[00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:05.456]  This is just flagrant threats to make all the intelligence agencies think, well, we better do what they say.
[00:16:05.496 --> 00:16:08.737]  They're really the legitimate government by calling everyone Russians.
[00:16:09.998 --> 00:16:10.578]  Well, guess what?
[00:16:11.919 --> 00:16:25.064]  The CFR, the Atlantic Council, the leftist CIA came out again in this new report and said they're going Russiagate 2.0 and that all of us that are from Trump are Russian agents and can even be killed.
[00:16:27.072 --> 00:16:29.454]  Oh, they're starting to talk about using kinetic action.
[00:16:29.634 --> 00:16:30.574]  You've seen them on the news.
[00:16:31.895 --> 00:16:38.719]  When they're saying kinetic action on the news, that's so their people hear that and think, well, we better follow orders to take out the Russians.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.621]  I mean, they're really got their targets.
[00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:48.285]  They've got their little orders in hands, a little death warrants for the president and everybody else.
[00:16:48.665 --> 00:16:51.567]  Good luck when you try to play that hand, son.
[00:16:52.607 --> 00:16:53.688]  But they're crazy enough to do it.
[00:16:54.565 --> 00:16:57.747]  That's why they're on the news saying they're gonna kill the president, stab Giuliani in the back.
[00:16:59.869 --> 00:17:07.534]  Because they've been in power, sucking off this country for 70 years, and they can't believe, like a record skipping, that the music ain't playing no more.
[00:17:09.415 --> 00:17:11.076]  And so they think, intimidate, intimidate.
[00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:12.777]  Hey, your terrorism isn't working.
[00:17:12.857 --> 00:17:13.758]  That's the definition of terrorism.
[00:17:14.178 --> 00:17:16.380]  Threatening violence or carrying out violent political aims.
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.743]  The Joker, all these movies are designed to cause mass shootings, and then blame us.
[00:17:21.023 --> 00:17:22.163]  It's not gonna hunt.
[00:17:22.644 --> 00:17:24.225]  That dog don't hunt, boy.
[00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:27.705]  Let's play Tucker Carlson finishing up.
[00:17:37.142 --> 00:17:42.525]  Against whether or not they predicted crucial events over the past 70 years.
[00:17:42.765 --> 00:17:44.527]  And again and again, they didn't.
[00:17:45.027 --> 00:17:47.628]  The CIA, for example, was shocked by the Korean War.
[00:17:48.249 --> 00:17:50.030]  It didn't predict the Soviet atomic bomb.
[00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:51.130]  Not a small thing.
[00:17:51.491 --> 00:17:54.593]  It missed the Cuban Missile Crisis and the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.
[00:17:55.113 --> 00:17:59.275]  It spent decades trying to bring down Fidel Castro to kill Fidel Castro.
[00:17:59.876 --> 00:18:01.237]  So naturally, his regime never fell.
[00:18:02.717 --> 00:18:05.059]  Hit pause real quick and back that up 15 seconds, please.
[00:18:08.578 --> 00:18:11.659]  They didn't predict Trump getting elected, and they didn't predict Infowars.
[00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:13.539]  Like, we predicted it all.
[00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.020]  Because we bet on humanity.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:15.940]  We believed in you.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.320]  Because I believe in myself!
[00:18:18.381 --> 00:18:19.961]  You're a red-blooded American just like me.
[00:18:19.981 --> 00:18:24.142]  I know a lot of great Americans, every race, color, and creed.
[00:18:24.523 --> 00:18:25.203]  We're not stupid.
[00:18:25.223 --> 00:18:26.183]  We're not getting pushed around.
[00:18:26.523 --> 00:18:27.243]  We've been asleep.
[00:18:27.723 --> 00:18:28.424]  We're awake now.
[00:18:28.844 --> 00:18:29.404]  Back to Tucker.
[00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:33.892]  The CIA, for example, was shocked by the Korean War.
[00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:36.273]  It didn't predict the Soviet atomic bomb.
[00:18:36.654 --> 00:18:37.374]  Not a small thing.
[00:18:37.734 --> 00:18:40.835]  It missed the Cuban Missile Crisis and the 1973 Arab-Israeli War.
[00:18:41.376 --> 00:18:45.518]  It spent decades trying to bring down Fidel Castro to kill Fidel Castro.
[00:18:46.138 --> 00:18:47.499]  So naturally, his regime never fell.
[00:18:47.739 --> 00:18:48.939]  Castro lived into his 90s.
[00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:54.482]  Meanwhile, the CIA spent decades propping up the Shah of Iran, so naturally, he tumbled from power.
[00:18:55.062 --> 00:18:58.724]  They didn't even provide a warning before that happened because they had no idea it was going to happen.
[00:18:59.482 --> 00:19:03.704]  When the Iron Curtain finally fell in 1989, the CIA was completely blindsided by it.
[00:19:04.124 --> 00:19:08.246]  They thought they had just predicted, in fact, that the Soviet Union was as strong as ever.
[00:19:09.307 --> 00:19:10.728]  And things didn't get better after that.
[00:19:11.148 --> 00:19:15.670]  The CIA had no idea that Saddam Hussein planned to invade Kuwait the next year in 1990.
[00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.732]  They were totally surprised by India's atomic bomb test eight years later.
[00:19:20.653 --> 00:19:24.855]  By 2003, they were totally confident that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.
[00:19:25.375 --> 00:19:29.097]  In fact, their biggest success in the past 50 years may have been creating the Taliban.
[00:19:30.327 --> 00:19:38.032]  If John Brennan had been working for a non-profit business, there would have been a shareholder revolt a long time ago and probably criminal charges.
[00:19:38.212 --> 00:19:39.593]  He would have been John DeLorean.
[00:19:40.493 --> 00:19:44.576]  But because it's a secretive government agency, the CIA has not been restrained.
[00:19:44.656 --> 00:19:47.858]  In fact, it's only become more powerful and more autonomous.
[00:19:48.718 --> 00:19:50.139]  Powerful enough to take down a president?
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:50.940]  We'll see.
[00:19:52.282 --> 00:20:01.850]  One reason that Permanent Washington is so powerful, of course, so resistant to change or oversight, is that it makes alliances with some of the least impressive but most ambitious members of Congress.
[00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:09.036]  Just days ago, for example, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff claimed his office had no contact whatsoever with the CIA whistleblower.
[00:20:10.337 --> 00:20:12.479]  First off, have you heard from the whistleblower?
[00:20:12.979 --> 00:20:15.441]  Do you want to hear from the whistleblower?
[00:20:15.561 --> 00:20:18.003]  We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower.
[00:20:18.023 --> 00:20:18.764]  We would like to.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.704]  Schiff also claims to know nothing about what was in the whistleblower's complaint before it came out.
[00:20:26.245 --> 00:20:29.127]  But yesterday, the New York Times revealed that both those claims were lies.
[00:20:29.687 --> 00:20:34.531]  Schiff apologized in a way, saying that he, quote, should have been much more clear.
[00:20:35.292 --> 00:20:35.492]  Right.
[00:20:36.133 --> 00:20:45.200]  Schiff now admits his office spoke to the whistleblower, who by the way, we learned tonight, is a registered Democrat, but insists his office did nothing to shape the complaint itself.
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.182]  But why would we believe that at this stage?
[00:20:50.819 --> 00:20:58.802]  Tucker has hit on the heart of the matter that I'll discuss when we come back after break, but there's really seven CIAs at least.
[00:21:00.163 --> 00:21:18.731]  But the dominant one that runs things is a bunch of effete, pipe-smoking, wine-drinking wimps who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag and who loathe the military and who loathe farmers and who loathe black people and who loathe people that
[00:21:19.588 --> 00:21:20.428]  They see us beneath them.
[00:21:20.449 --> 00:21:26.952]  They're a bunch of white shoe boy frat boys who are in the elitist club and all go around kissing each other's asses.
[00:21:29.073 --> 00:21:31.935]  And that's why all they can do is preside over selling the country out.
[00:21:33.996 --> 00:21:39.059]  And the world's sick of them, America's sick of them, the military's sick of them, and look, you've already lost, okay?
[00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:42.301]  I don't sit here and make claims like you do just to have confidence.
[00:21:42.521 --> 00:21:44.082]  We have kicked your ass.
[00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:49.711]  And so let me give you some more predictions when we come back, white shoe boys, about what's going to happen to you.
[00:21:49.951 --> 00:21:51.572]  And I may not be alive at the end of it.
[00:21:52.012 --> 00:21:53.812]  A lot of us won't be if they want to go down this road.
[00:21:53.992 --> 00:21:57.033]  But let me tell you, they're going to get their asses handed to them.
[00:21:57.773 --> 00:22:00.314]  They need to surrender right now and get out of the way.
[00:22:01.094 --> 00:22:02.755]  Because we don't, we're not vindictive.
[00:22:03.595 --> 00:22:05.195]  They all just run off with their stolen money.
[00:22:05.215 --> 00:22:05.896]  They'd be left alone.
[00:22:06.376 --> 00:22:07.696]  But with them, it's existential.
[00:22:07.776 --> 00:22:10.697]  They need to dominate us to ever feel like they're real men.
[00:22:11.797 --> 00:22:12.617]  That's their quest.
[00:22:12.938 --> 00:22:13.658]  They hate America.
[00:22:13.678 --> 00:22:14.338]  They always did.
[00:22:15.384 --> 00:22:16.629]  They hate the real strength of the country.
[00:22:17.634 --> 00:22:18.337]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:22:18.357 --> 00:22:19.381]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[00:22:19.401 --> 00:22:20.064]  Please don't forget.
[00:22:21.408 --> 00:22:23.429]  We're only here because you support us and spread the word.
[00:22:23.729 --> 00:22:26.490]  Band Dot Video is exploding in the amount of views and support it's getting.
[00:22:27.571 --> 00:22:30.732]  A lot of great stuff's happening at NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:22:31.192 --> 00:22:33.193]  And I was going to have to end the big mega sale.
[00:22:33.573 --> 00:22:36.334]  You notice I barely plugged Friday, didn't plug any yesterday on the Sunday show.
[00:22:36.634 --> 00:22:37.815]  I've been so busy on breaking news.
[00:22:38.195 --> 00:22:39.496]  So I don't have new specials yet.
[00:22:39.556 --> 00:22:48.319]  So for today or tomorrow max, the big giant mega sale, free shipping store wide, 50% optimal Patriot points is still running for 48 hours maximum.
[00:22:52.096 --> 00:23:18.778]  We are living in historic times, and it's critical to understand that when you study history, most of the time before a giant world war starts, or a cascade of wars, or economic collapse, or just major earth-wrecking changes, people don't realize they're in the crisis until they're already deep into it, or sometimes until it's already run over them like an out-of-control locomotive.
[00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:24.372]  So I don't want to just sit here as a spectator while the globalists rule over us.
[00:23:24.572 --> 00:23:25.632]  I want to be involved.
[00:23:25.812 --> 00:23:27.553]  I want to be a history's actor.
[00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:40.379]  Remember Karl Rove famously, like 15 years ago, during the first Bush term of W, was at a cocktail party of the Washington Post, the New York Times, and others.
[00:23:41.237 --> 00:23:43.098]  And they're like, hey, the WMDs weren't there.
[00:23:43.118 --> 00:23:44.878]  I mean, you got proven to be a liar and you made it up.
[00:23:44.898 --> 00:23:45.678]  And he goes, it doesn't matter.
[00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:47.259]  I control reality.
[00:23:47.399 --> 00:23:48.259]  I'm history's actor.
[00:23:48.899 --> 00:23:51.320]  And you will dutifully report whatever new reality I tell you.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.761]  Whether, you know, 2 plus 2 equals 10 or 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:56.262]  Whatever I tell you, you'll do.
[00:23:58.503 --> 00:24:00.763]  And then at the same cocktail party, Richard Perle was there.
[00:24:00.783 --> 00:24:06.585]  And he was walking up to women going, he later basically admitted this, going, you know, I'm powerful.
[00:24:07.766 --> 00:24:08.806]  I've killed millions.
[00:24:10.247 --> 00:24:11.307]  Maybe just go, ugh.
[00:24:14.889 --> 00:24:15.789]  Big fat guy.
[00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.610]  Probably couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs.
[00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.611]  You know, I kill a lot of people.
[00:24:20.551 --> 00:24:21.212]  Like Obama.
[00:24:21.392 --> 00:24:23.813]  I'm really good at killing people with predator drones.
[00:24:27.421 --> 00:24:31.902]  I know a lot of people that have killed hundreds of people apiece, and they're not really proud of it.
[00:24:32.402 --> 00:24:35.823]  They did it because they thought it was right, or they were ordered to, but they certainly don't talk about it a lot.
[00:24:36.343 --> 00:24:37.444]  They certainly don't brag about it.
[00:24:37.704 --> 00:24:38.484]  That's not good luck.
[00:24:39.264 --> 00:24:42.025]  But all these guys that never even got in a fistfight.
[00:24:42.725 --> 00:24:44.566]  Oh, they're gonna kill Trump.
[00:24:44.766 --> 00:24:45.726]  Oh, they're gonna get me.
[00:24:46.386 --> 00:24:48.887]  Oh, they're gonna stab Giuliani in the back.
[00:24:49.347 --> 00:24:49.507]  Yeah.
[00:24:52.008 --> 00:24:53.068]  Biggest mistake you ever made.
[00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:56.342]  But you're going to make it, aren't you?
[00:24:56.922 --> 00:24:57.623]  I know you are.
[00:24:59.484 --> 00:25:02.547]  One way or another, losers always blow their feet off, don't they?
[00:25:03.628 --> 00:25:12.555]  So, I'm going to do my best to walk through the huge giant news, and then we're going to open the phones up at the start of the next hour, and I'm going to be very dutiful.
[00:25:12.975 --> 00:25:16.418]  I'm going to go to a lot of you, and just please say ditto as they do on Rush.
[00:25:16.858 --> 00:25:17.559]  No need to thank me.
[00:25:17.659 --> 00:25:18.039]  I love you.
[00:25:18.099 --> 00:25:18.619]  You love me.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.661]  We're a happy family, as Barney says.
[00:25:21.181 --> 00:25:22.903]  But I'm going to put people to the front of the line,
[00:25:24.616 --> 00:25:25.497]  That disagree.
[00:25:25.617 --> 00:25:27.978]  You can disagree with me, Trump.
[00:25:28.078 --> 00:25:29.179]  I mean, we're not a cult here.
[00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:35.123]  I'd love to hear if you think Trump needs to be impeached or you really think what he did was wrong.
[00:25:35.463 --> 00:25:38.665]  You'll have a chance to get on air as well.
[00:25:38.705 --> 00:25:47.391]  In fact, if you'd like to start lining up folks that disagree up front, I want to give people only that disagree to give a chance to call in at first.
[00:25:47.611 --> 00:25:50.833]  Then others can call in, you know, after we get some of those folks on the board.
[00:25:50.873 --> 00:25:51.574]  I know you're out there.
[00:25:53.622 --> 00:25:54.523]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:25:54.543 --> 00:25:54.923]  877-789-2539.
[00:25:55.243 --> 00:26:06.548]  Just please make your point and I'll try to respond to it, but I want to get you on.
[00:26:06.568 --> 00:26:06.608]  877-789-2539.
[00:26:08.209 --> 00:26:11.310]  Tell me Trump deserves to be impeached.
[00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:15.492]  Explain to me how he's done things that are bad, but all the deep states not done anything at all.
[00:26:16.172 --> 00:26:17.933]  Or maybe you just don't care, you just don't like Trump.
[00:26:17.973 --> 00:26:18.233]  Tell me.
[00:26:19.824 --> 00:26:22.866]  Again, the toll-free number is 877-789-ALEX.
[00:26:22.886 --> 00:26:24.487]  877-789-2539.
[00:26:24.687 --> 00:26:31.752]  And then after that, anybody that called in and didn't get on air yesterday, you're welcome up front as well after those folks.
[00:26:31.772 --> 00:26:33.574]  There'll just be general open phones.
[00:26:33.594 --> 00:26:38.217]  But please don't try to call if you agree or you're not somebody that disagrees until we start the next hour.
[00:26:38.517 --> 00:26:42.400]  Phones are only open right now for people that disagree.
[00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:42.640]  877-789-2539.
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.802]  Then as soon as the next hour starts, I'll go to your calls.
[00:26:47.335 --> 00:26:53.720]  Let me announce the big enchilada, then we'll get into it in even more detail than yesterday, and I have more information now.
[00:26:55.262 --> 00:27:12.035]  Four days ago, the Marine General that is actively in charge of the Marine Corps and their operations put a directive out from the Commander-in-Chief that the Marines are now directly under the President's command.
[00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:21.532]  Which is his purview as Commander-in-Chief in wartime and that they're ready to act domestically for an emergency within the United States to stop illegal coup.
[00:27:23.713 --> 00:27:27.594]  We're going to walk over all of that and how historic this is and how big that is.
[00:27:27.634 --> 00:27:28.474]  Here's the actual quotes.
[00:27:28.554 --> 00:27:28.754]  U.S.
[00:27:28.774 --> 00:27:34.816]  Marine Reserve units activated for emergency in the United States, which will come with little warning besides threats to the homeland.
[00:27:34.836 --> 00:27:35.356]  Those are quotes.
[00:27:36.936 --> 00:27:38.637]  Against the Marines that protect the President.
[00:27:40.555 --> 00:28:09.879]  Specifically and or directly under his command and that guard the White House and all the rest of it and it was Marines that were called out to stop the coup against Roosevelt and the McCormick Dixting committee exposed all that there were quiet arrest of thousands when that happened on the eve of World War two Actually came to Smedley Butler to lead the Nazi takeover working with George W Bush's grandfather Prescott Bush But Prescott was too big to fail
[00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:14.940]  He agreed to double-cross the Nazis at the end and transfer the money into U.S.
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.520]  bank accounts.
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.724]  He was allowed to operate, but everybody else either got cement shoes or went to prison.
[00:28:19.744 --> 00:28:25.891]  But it was so embarrassing, it was kept quiet until the end of World War II, and they had hearings to flesh out all the things that went on.
[00:28:26.271 --> 00:28:31.256]  My film, Endgame, Blue River Global Enslavement, starts with congressional hearing clips with actually that happening.
[00:28:31.296 --> 00:28:34.820]  So, we've been through this before, actually quite a few times.
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:45.482]  And it was the Marines that were quietly called out to go kill the operatives in the United States, quietly.
[00:28:46.762 --> 00:28:52.384]  So, you better believe this is a very serious bridge to be crossing.
[00:28:53.944 --> 00:29:01.306]  And Hillary has this psychotic fake confidence that she's still in command of the Democrats to a great extent, and that she believes she's invincible.
[00:29:02.306 --> 00:29:06.207]  All because as other globalists died over the years, she was given a lot of the reins of power.
[00:29:07.315 --> 00:29:08.135]  Kind of inherited it.
[00:29:09.115 --> 00:29:11.196]  And she's holding on, but she intends to run.
[00:29:11.236 --> 00:29:15.557]  I told you this three years ago, two years ago, a year ago, six months ago, a month ago.
[00:29:16.657 --> 00:29:23.458]  Now, could Trump's impeachment crisis push Hillary Clinton to run in 2020?
[00:29:23.498 --> 00:29:27.419]  Steve Bannon predicts Hillary will run in 2020.
[00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:31.280]  We've got the reports for you all showing the evidence that she's already running.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.680]  She just hasn't announced it.
[00:29:33.695 --> 00:29:38.296]  It's one of the featured videos at Band.Video, breaking Hillary Clinton runs for president 2020.
[00:29:40.077 --> 00:29:41.317]  That's all coming up as well.
[00:29:41.377 --> 00:29:46.439]  Meanwhile, Joe Biden donors gather for emergency closed-door meeting as campaign loses steam.
[00:29:47.339 --> 00:29:49.800]  Three other candidates are raising more money than he is.
[00:29:51.841 --> 00:29:55.702]  I told you four months ago he'd obviously had another stroke and would end up having to drop out.
[00:29:56.342 --> 00:29:59.063]  Now it's all over the news that he could drop out any day.
[00:30:01.553 --> 00:30:06.717]  I told you that I talked to security services that were in the room when he was cussing, saying, why the hell did I do this?
[00:30:06.737 --> 00:30:07.718]  I ought to just drop out.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.621]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:30:13.062 --> 00:30:14.523]  So we'll be looking at every angle of that.
[00:30:15.924 --> 00:30:23.750]  Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, that in this crisis, we're winning, but just barely.
[00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:30.075]  And your word of mouth, you're telling people about Bandot video, you're emailing and text messaging and sending out articles and videos.
[00:30:31.109 --> 00:30:31.169]  Is
[00:30:47.825 --> 00:30:50.886]  I still just am expanding spending some backup reserves I saved.
[00:30:51.326 --> 00:30:58.648]  I don't like doing that, but gut level tells me just press the accelerator all the way down and that we're going to get to the next point going into 2020.
[00:30:59.229 --> 00:31:00.129]  They've hit us with a lot.
[00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:00.909]  I'm not complaining.
[00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:04.530]  It goes with the territory, but your financial support makes it all possible.
[00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:09.292]  Since the impeachment and the martial law and all this came up, we're seeing a lot more orders.
[00:31:09.352 --> 00:31:12.453]  That's good, but at 50% off all the products,
[00:31:14.195 --> 00:31:16.458]  Storewide free shipping and double patriot points.
[00:31:17.018 --> 00:31:24.767]  Some of these items like the high quality silver wound gel, skin cream with a hyaluronic acid and all the vitamins.
[00:31:24.867 --> 00:31:27.671]  I mean, that is a first-rate product at 50% off.
[00:31:28.452 --> 00:31:29.252]  I just get so busy.
[00:31:29.613 --> 00:31:31.095]  I said all the supplements 50% off.
[00:31:31.515 --> 00:31:32.937]  Well, that's not really a supplement folks.
[00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:35.852]  That's at cost, actually.
[00:31:36.473 --> 00:31:38.075]  Like with the free shipping, we lose money on it.
[00:31:38.255 --> 00:31:39.016]  But I'm leaving it up.
[00:31:39.556 --> 00:31:40.878]  We have the small tubes, the big tubes.
[00:31:40.918 --> 00:31:42.339]  It's incredible for men, women, you name it.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.861]  But it's not just for your skin health.
[00:31:43.941 --> 00:31:45.843]  It's for defending your body against viruses and bacteria.
[00:31:46.343 --> 00:31:47.605]  It's something you can put on beforehand.
[00:31:47.685 --> 00:31:48.246]  It's amazing.
[00:31:48.666 --> 00:31:50.027]  And there's just so many other products.
[00:31:50.067 --> 00:31:54.592]  The toothpaste, the great coffee, the wonderful, super strong...
[00:31:55.473 --> 00:31:57.374]  Turmeric bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:31:57.974 --> 00:31:59.435]  It's all at infowarestore.com.
[00:31:59.455 --> 00:32:01.955]  We have to extend this a couple more days because I've been so busy.
[00:32:01.975 --> 00:32:03.176]  I haven't come up with a new special yet.
[00:32:03.316 --> 00:32:04.656]  It's our biggest special since Christmas.
[00:32:04.676 --> 00:32:05.437]  Please take advantage of it.
[00:32:08.138 --> 00:32:13.220]  I gotta tell you, it feels good to be standing up, not just for my country, but for what's right.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.302]  And you grow up hearing your parents talk about this relative of the Revolutionary War, that relative
[00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:32.081]  Meeting at the Hermitage in Tennessee with President Jackson and engineering the plan to invade Texas for a takeover that they planned to launch 10 years later.
[00:32:32.621 --> 00:32:33.482]  It was all premeditated.
[00:32:34.402 --> 00:32:39.203]  And you hear all this, and then later you go read the history books and it's true, and you think, man, how am I gonna measure up?
[00:32:40.343 --> 00:32:42.984]  And then I never even intended to try to measure up to any of that.
[00:32:43.084 --> 00:32:46.664]  And here we are, living it again, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:47.965 --> 00:32:49.785]  And we're blessed enough to have a real president
[00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:57.504]  Who will take on these people and challenge them to their face and defiantly not bow to their evil threats and their corruption.
[00:32:59.566 --> 00:33:00.987]  They're going to try to take the president out.
[00:33:01.007 --> 00:33:02.629]  It's such an incredible time to be alive.
[00:33:03.349 --> 00:33:05.451]  So let me get to this stack of news.
[00:33:06.912 --> 00:33:12.677]  And I don't want to incorporate myself into a story for no reason, but I'm in the story.
[00:33:13.357 --> 00:33:16.740]  And so I have to incorporate myself or I'd be lying to you.
[00:33:18.595 --> 00:33:21.998]  But if you look at what they're scared of, this is it.
[00:33:22.578 --> 00:33:30.745]  Independent, a support base that knows what's going on, that can't be bullied or driven off, and people that are focused and taking action.
[00:33:31.425 --> 00:33:33.427]  That's why the President has more support than ever.
[00:33:34.648 --> 00:33:40.112]  Even in their fake polls, he's three, four, five points ahead of where Obama was three years into his first term.
[00:33:41.834 --> 00:33:44.015]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:33:46.217 --> 00:33:46.758]  They're scared of you.
[00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.512]  They're scared of you knowing you're winning.
[00:33:51.133 --> 00:33:52.975]  So this article is up on Infowars.com.
[00:33:53.115 --> 00:33:54.296]  It's a Steve Watson article.
[00:33:54.936 --> 00:34:04.645]  Hillary is making the rounds, saying Trump needs to be impeached again because the Russians got him in and they're going to try to steal this next election.
[00:34:04.705 --> 00:34:05.746]  No evidence, all lie.
[00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.792]  And that they need to use the powers they have to counter
[00:34:13.632 --> 00:34:15.052]  The Russian operatives.
[00:34:15.092 --> 00:34:19.233]  Didn't you read the groups they've got involved and how they say they're going to counter it?
[00:34:20.093 --> 00:34:39.938]  It's thousands of former Obama and Clinton and Bush appointees, but mainly liberals, leftists, who got those billions that Obama put in when he left office in the Stay Behind Network, the Rebuilding America's Defenses, you know, Part 2.0, Countering Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act.
[00:34:40.836 --> 00:34:41.676]  Sounds like it's a good thing.
[00:34:41.716 --> 00:34:44.777]  No, it's countering patriots fighting the CHICOM sellout.
[00:34:46.357 --> 00:34:51.318]  And so Hillary's out there rebooting it and putting out Atlantic Council talking points.
[00:34:51.398 --> 00:34:59.500]  And that's, again, the private intelligence agencies that transferred the power out of the U.S.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:07.302]  agencies to themselves who still have security clearances operating this shadow rogue government that's openly interfacing with the corporate
[00:35:08.271 --> 00:35:18.922]  Lying media to try to drum up race war, division, economic collapse, and the overthrow of the president because he is a populist nationalist candidate.
[00:35:19.262 --> 00:35:24.408]  So the destruction of your will, making themselves the permanent state openly.
[00:35:27.671 --> 00:35:30.374]  So Hillary comes out in this speech, she's given a bunch of these speeches.
[00:35:33.021 --> 00:35:35.922]  And she talks about the case for impeachment with the fake Russia.
[00:35:36.202 --> 00:35:38.443]  Now, you'd say that doesn't make any sense.
[00:35:38.763 --> 00:35:39.403]  That's been disproven.
[00:35:39.903 --> 00:35:41.184]  That's how they get the funding.
[00:35:41.224 --> 00:35:46.826]  That's how they tell their people, hey, we're not overthrowing an election, we're overthrowing a foreign Russian takeover.
[00:35:47.186 --> 00:35:49.707]  When they're the globalists actually overthrowing the country.
[00:35:50.827 --> 00:35:55.449]  And now having that overthrow taken away from them at the 11th hour, 58th minute.
[00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:58.070]  So, here's Hillary.
[00:36:00.054 --> 00:36:05.397]  Cites Russian conspiracy theory at George Washington University over the weekend.
[00:36:05.837 --> 00:36:06.477]  Here's what she said.
[00:36:07.878 --> 00:36:08.719]  All bets are off.
[00:36:08.979 --> 00:36:22.826]  If foreign governments think they can tilt the playing field as they did against me, which was a deliberate, well-planned effort laid out in indictments against Russian military... Hit pause.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.881]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[00:36:26.061 --> 00:36:38.249]  Laid out in these indictments of 13 internet bots from the Internet Research Group, that's really a CIA triple agent front group in DC.
[00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:44.533]  And then the people showed up in court who run the company saying, we're here.
[00:36:44.973 --> 00:36:47.655]  And so now Mueller doesn't know what to do.
[00:36:48.697 --> 00:36:59.987]  And it's come out in court that they have no evidence, and it's all made up, and that there's just internet companies in Russia you can hire that'll do any advertising you want, and go around spam laws, and 80% of all the advertising done in 2016 was done for Hillary!
[00:37:00.007 --> 00:37:02.329]  Isn't that funny?
[00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:08.795]  80% of the money in the campaign was given to Hillary, and exactly 80% of spending in Russia was for Hillary.
[00:37:09.936 --> 00:37:14.760]  Just like anybody else, you can go hire British bots, Mexican bots, Canadian bots,
[00:37:16.971 --> 00:37:18.292]  Military actors and their allies, well,
[00:37:47.325 --> 00:37:53.327]  You know, the Republicans seem to think that, okay, so far Russia's playing on the red team.
[00:37:53.347 --> 00:37:55.308]  Stop this again.
[00:37:55.768 --> 00:37:56.228]  Start it over.
[00:37:56.248 --> 00:37:56.688]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:56.708 --> 00:37:58.209]  Do you understand the magnitude of this?
[00:37:59.169 --> 00:38:02.490]  She's just saying, oh, we have foreign military actors and their allies.
[00:38:03.874 --> 00:38:05.495]  And so those allies can be killed.
[00:38:05.755 --> 00:38:07.296]  That's what Mudd and others are saying on TV.
[00:38:07.816 --> 00:38:13.620]  They're just saying this when she's the globalist that sold us out to China and Russia and anybody else that would pay.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.321]  She's not a Russian agent or a Chinese agent.
[00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:18.703]  She's a pimp that sells us out.
[00:38:19.123 --> 00:38:19.863]  She's an enemy.
[00:38:21.965 --> 00:38:24.366]  And then you get into the Senate reports and these articles I've got.
[00:38:24.586 --> 00:38:26.027]  They name me as a Russian agent.
[00:38:26.287 --> 00:38:27.208]  I don't get a day in court.
[00:38:27.228 --> 00:38:28.528]  I don't get to face anybody.
[00:38:29.289 --> 00:38:32.891]  The people funding me are the American people buying our products and she damn well knows that.
[00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.709]  Let's see.
[00:38:35.289 --> 00:38:36.750]  That's how they turned all this loose on us.
[00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:37.330]  Continue.
[00:38:38.851 --> 00:38:52.016]  Military actors and their allies, well, you know, the Republicans seem to think that, okay, so far Russia's playing on the red team and, you know, so we like it.
[00:38:52.036 --> 00:38:53.456]  We're not going to stand up against it.
[00:38:53.476 --> 00:38:57.498]  Well, who's to say that next week they're going to be playing on the blue team?
[00:38:57.638 --> 00:38:58.999]  It's crazy, my friends.
[00:38:59.039 --> 00:38:59.919]  They were always on your team.
[00:39:00.503 --> 00:39:11.230]  Impeachment is the appropriate remedy and it is such a serious assault on our democracy that is apparently
[00:39:13.513 --> 00:39:19.256]  Let's stop again.
[00:39:19.276 --> 00:39:23.778]  She just lied and said the whole thing is Russia got Trump in, when none of that's true.
[00:39:23.818 --> 00:39:25.439]  Just like Malazzi Ford's, it's all lies.
[00:39:26.339 --> 00:39:27.280]  I can't listen to it anymore.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.501]  Then she goes into how his allies have to pay.
[00:39:29.821 --> 00:39:32.162]  We've got to go after them, not just Trump.
[00:39:33.203 --> 00:39:34.304]  It's more of the same bullying.
[00:39:34.384 --> 00:39:37.245]  Hey listen lady, all that does is piss everybody off.
[00:39:38.246 --> 00:39:39.546]  And it makes the American people angry.
[00:39:39.966 --> 00:39:40.587]  Now let's move on.
[00:39:42.005 --> 00:39:42.905]  This all ties together.
[00:39:44.186 --> 00:39:44.806]  Backfire!
[00:39:44.986 --> 00:39:49.488]  NBA Houston Rockets cower to Communist China, get blasted online.
[00:39:49.528 --> 00:39:51.569]  Later we'll play the video from the team owner.
[00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:53.410]  All of it's pathetic.
[00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:59.493]  Their manager said that he stands in solidarity with Hong Kong and their wish to not be extradited to China.
[00:39:59.513 --> 00:40:03.775]  They're getting rid of all their freedoms, China's taking them over, even though they have a treaty saying they can't.
[00:40:05.415 --> 00:40:09.117]  There was a backlash by the Chinese government and quote Chinese businesses in the US.
[00:40:09.137 --> 00:40:10.718]  That means Chinese government front companies.
[00:40:11.963 --> 00:40:17.164]  So he came out and apologized, the team owner came out and apologized, and said that basically the Hong Kong people are horrible.
[00:40:18.025 --> 00:40:21.265]  Now there's even bigger backlash from Ted Cruz and others, and there rightfully should be.
[00:40:22.726 --> 00:40:28.947]  This is the political correctness now, where team managers can't even say they support Hong Kong.
[00:40:29.467 --> 00:40:30.288]  That's pathetic.
[00:40:30.568 --> 00:40:31.608]  That's the censorship.
[00:40:32.068 --> 00:40:33.508]  That's the gelding in this country.
[00:40:34.289 --> 00:40:39.550]  You give away all your rights, you give away all your liberties, you bow to everybody, and pretty soon you are a nobody.
[00:40:40.776 --> 00:40:53.720]  It's an old Chinese saying, that if a man is wood, and basically files himself down for other people's tastes, pretty soon he won't exist.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.321]  And that's a butchering of it out of the Mandarin, but I read it years ago.
[00:40:58.361 --> 00:41:01.722]  And that's it, you give a little bit of yourself up every time, pretty soon you don't know who you are!
[00:41:01.742 --> 00:41:05.263]  And you have no power to even live your own life!
[00:41:07.415 --> 00:41:08.435]  Because it all ties together.
[00:41:09.256 --> 00:41:10.796]  Concentration camp survivors.
[00:41:10.856 --> 00:41:12.517]  China using forced sterilization.
[00:41:12.597 --> 00:41:13.878]  Abortion for genocide.
[00:41:14.418 --> 00:41:17.399]  Hong Kong government considering internet ban to stop protest.
[00:41:17.959 --> 00:41:19.500]  Just not letting anybody have social media.
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:24.562]  That's where all this is going is incrementally just no social media or interaction to begin with.
[00:41:24.582 --> 00:41:28.884]  I've got a special report I'm filing later to Joe Rogan on this subject.
[00:41:28.984 --> 00:41:30.285]  It's very powerful at the end of the show.
[00:41:31.505 --> 00:41:33.346]  Now that ties into this piece I was mentioning.
[00:41:34.841 --> 00:41:36.683]  Taibbi, censorship does not end well.
[00:41:36.723 --> 00:41:44.490]  Rolling Stone goes on to say the Atlantic Council, run by the CIA and the left in Congress, is targeting Alex Jones to shut him down.
[00:41:44.951 --> 00:41:45.612]  That's the article.
[00:41:45.632 --> 00:41:46.813]  I just wanted to show you that.
[00:41:48.186 --> 00:41:48.907]  Because here it is.
[00:41:49.788 --> 00:41:52.371]  The Atlantic Council has now published Information Wars.
[00:41:52.831 --> 00:41:56.736]  Information Wars, how we lost the global battle against disinformation and what we can do about it.
[00:41:57.156 --> 00:42:04.385]  It goes into talk about shutting me down, shutting all conservatives down by saying we're Russian agents and how operatives in the government can do this.
[00:42:04.825 --> 00:42:07.649]  Information Wars, a conversation with Richard Stengel.
[00:42:08.874 --> 00:42:15.900]  Atlantic Council, that's the spooks, doing what Hillary said, name us all as Russians and ban us having any speech, bank accounts.
[00:42:16.121 --> 00:42:18.943]  They go on to say the NRA are Russian agents.
[00:42:19.063 --> 00:42:19.564]  I'm not kidding.
[00:42:20.285 --> 00:42:23.507]  Oh yeah, there's headlines that Putin runs the NRA.
[00:42:23.568 --> 00:42:24.528]  Type it in, I'm not joking.
[00:42:24.729 --> 00:42:26.250]  They're coming after everything.
[00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:31.395]  They're coming after you by naming all Americans enemy spies when they're the enemy globalists.
[00:42:33.646 --> 00:42:35.927]  All right, we got callers that disagree with me.
[00:42:35.967 --> 00:42:37.368]  They think Trump needs to be impeached.
[00:42:37.428 --> 00:42:39.069]  We're going to them next segment.
[00:42:39.509 --> 00:42:41.390]  Bonnie and Brandon and others.
[00:42:42.451 --> 00:42:55.038]  And then we're going to open the phones up for everybody on the civil war that's going hot more and more, the attempts to impeach Trump, the deep state openly threatening to kill Trump and others on TV.
[00:42:55.918 --> 00:42:57.719]  This is terrorism they're engaged in.
[00:42:57.739 --> 00:43:00.501]  So what do you do when these globalists that hate the country are doing this?
[00:43:01.442 --> 00:43:03.763]  They're the ones that have taken us to this point.
[00:43:04.643 --> 00:43:06.324]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:43:06.384 --> 00:43:13.587]  And more on the Communist China threatening the NBA to accept their directives or they won't let the NBA into China.
[00:43:13.767 --> 00:43:14.868]  But first, here's a key report.
[00:43:26.733 --> 00:43:36.058]  After we got banned off YouTube and every other major platform last year, we set out to build something that's very easy to navigate, very easy to find what you're looking for, and very, very easy to share.
[00:43:36.519 --> 00:43:41.021]  So the first thing you want to do is realize there's two different ways to easily navigate Banned.Video.
[00:43:41.261 --> 00:43:46.184]  The first off is up in the left-hand corner, the three lines right by Banned.Video logo.
[00:43:46.644 --> 00:43:49.986]  If you click that, it shows all the hosts, all the different contributors.
[00:43:50.426 --> 00:43:52.428]  When you go to their page, if they're live,
[00:43:53.328 --> 00:43:55.370]  It will show that they're live on air.
[00:43:55.630 --> 00:44:00.834]  If they're not live, their last full show will be archived in the first line of videos.
[00:44:01.334 --> 00:44:07.018]  Below that, if you don't have time to watch the full show, like most of us don't, we'll have hot, informative clips.
[00:44:07.418 --> 00:44:13.823]  And then beneath that we'll have special reports, documentaries, speeches, special events and guests underneath that as well.
[00:44:14.123 --> 00:44:17.946]  So there's these three rows of videos that make navigation easy.
[00:44:18.406 --> 00:44:33.445]  On each one of the links you see on the side, Alex Jones Show, The War Room with Owen Schroer, David Knight Show, Firepower with that great crew, Paul Watson, Caitlin Bennett, Millie Weaver, John Baum, Special Reports, and again a bunch of others that we've now added as well.
[00:44:33.585 --> 00:44:36.669]  Another way to navigate is simply right off the front page where the shows are
[00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:39.051]  Posted from the top right down.
[00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:41.692]  And if somebody's live, you'll see the live feature right there.
[00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:43.393]  You can click and watch the show.
[00:44:43.953 --> 00:44:52.096]  While watching the full shows or clips, when you find that vital piece of information that you really want to share with people, it's very, very easy to do.
[00:44:52.816 --> 00:44:58.419]  All you do to download is just click the download button below any of the videos, and then it's yours.
[00:44:58.679 --> 00:44:59.239]  Free to air.
[00:44:59.619 --> 00:45:00.840]  Share it however you want.
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:01.840]  Stream it out.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:02.801]  Repost it.
[00:45:03.241 --> 00:45:03.561]  Edit it.
[00:45:03.921 --> 00:45:05.061]  This is free to air.
[00:45:05.542 --> 00:45:06.082]  Fair use.
[00:45:07.423 --> 00:45:11.285]  100% your purview to use however you see fit in the information war.
[00:45:12.045 --> 00:45:19.450]  Whether it's an archive show, whether it's a clip, whether it's a hot meme, it's critical that you share the links.
[00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:23.652]  Especially the live shows when there's breaking news.
[00:45:24.132 --> 00:45:31.537]  That's a great way to go viral with the truth and get over that Berlin Wall of lies that the globalists have put out there.
[00:45:31.977 --> 00:45:36.300]  And again, we've got a lot of different ways to share the videos right underneath them.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.422]  That is the next part of the equation.
[00:45:39.462 --> 00:45:41.604]  When you do that, it changes the world.
[00:45:41.844 --> 00:45:48.588]  All the censorship, all the attacks have been about stopping you from sharing that information.
[00:45:48.969 --> 00:45:59.056]  So keep checking back at Banned.Video and realize there's nothing out there in the world that represents nationalism, patriotism, capitalism, the free market, Americana,
[00:45:59.756 --> 00:46:01.537]  That is this sophisticated or this good?
[00:46:01.937 --> 00:46:05.919]  Now granted, it's nothing compared to Facebook or Google, but that's how these things begin.
[00:46:06.399 --> 00:46:08.080]  So we built InfoWars years ago.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.361]  We've got radio satellites.
[00:46:09.401 --> 00:46:10.461]  We've got TV satellites.
[00:46:10.762 --> 00:46:12.262]  We're syndicated on radio and TV.
[00:46:12.582 --> 00:46:14.003]  We have our own audio and video feeds.
[00:46:14.043 --> 00:46:19.606]  But we wanted to put something out that's easy to navigate, like YouTube, and that could be expanded.
[00:46:19.666 --> 00:46:25.129]  So this is really an arsenal of freedom going into 2020 to counter the globalists.
[00:46:25.889 --> 00:46:42.396]  And they're Chai Com handlers that are trying to overthrow this country and force a coup against a sitting president while they try to silence all the independent media that are still faithful to our nation, faithful to truth, faithful to journalism, and our republic.
[00:46:42.756 --> 00:46:51.540]  So, a new key weapon in the fight against the globalists and a key weapon to fight for a free humanity, not just for Americans but people worldwide, is Ban.Video.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:53.161]  Please check it out today.
[00:46:53.661 --> 00:47:01.146]  And also, share it with your friends, family, and neighbors in your community, because we truly are in an information war, and there is a war on for our minds.
[00:47:01.907 --> 00:47:04.808]  If we didn't have power, the system wouldn't be trying to shut us up.
[00:47:05.149 --> 00:47:09.031]  The truth is, truth does have power, so let's spread it today.
[00:47:09.431 --> 00:47:13.734]  The truth lives at Bandot Video, so please join us in this epic fight.
[00:47:13.995 --> 00:47:14.455]  Thank you all.
[00:47:22.253 --> 00:47:27.078]  We are now into the second hour on this October 7th, 2019 global transmission.
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:36.088]  About 25 minutes ago, I opened the phones up and said, if you disagree, I think Trump really should be impeached.
[00:47:37.269 --> 00:47:38.591]  Well, it's your chance to call in.
[00:47:38.631 --> 00:47:39.572]  You can always call in.
[00:47:41.004 --> 00:47:44.969]  We're not like leftist talk radio where they only get people that agree with them.
[00:47:44.989 --> 00:47:45.550]  That's what they do.
[00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:53.960]  We're not censors like those that run the colleges now and have turned them into institutions of brainwashing and Soviet-style learning.
[00:47:56.283 --> 00:47:57.424]  No, we want to hear from you.
[00:47:58.486 --> 00:47:59.267]  And I see that in
[00:48:01.937 --> 00:48:05.423]  25 minutes or so, 30 minutes you've had to get on the phone and call us.
[00:48:06.365 --> 00:48:08.448]  Four of you have called and gotten on the line.
[00:48:08.949 --> 00:48:12.475]  Bonnie, Gerald, Brandon, and someone else I see they're queuing up.
[00:48:12.495 --> 00:48:14.619]  So we're going to go to you here in just a moment.
[00:48:15.546 --> 00:48:25.249]  And then, everybody else can now call in at this point, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539 on this Monday edition.
[00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:34.032]  If you just joined us, the big, giant, huge, earth-shaking news is on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:48:34.573 --> 00:48:38.514]  It originates an article from Mike Adams at NaturalNews.com.
[00:48:38.594 --> 00:48:39.634]  I worked with him on the report.
[00:48:40.315 --> 00:48:43.256]  I have some of my sources as well that confirm
[00:48:44.156 --> 00:48:54.478]  That President Trump, if he feels like he's being removed extrajudicially, outside of impeachment, that he will call the Marines out to defend the executive branch from coup plotters.
[00:48:55.278 --> 00:49:11.421]  Just because Phil Mudd and Robert Mueller and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say that Trump's a Russian agent, when they're the globalists and they're the foreign agents, like a travel agent selling us out to the highest bidder, just because they all say that doesn't mean they get to remove him.
[00:49:12.534 --> 00:49:24.936]  And they're all over the Aspen Institute, CNN, MSNBC, saying, the government's gonna kill this guy, we're gonna stab him in the back, we're gonna kill Giuliani, we're gonna burn down their supporters, we're gonna wipe out their supporters.
[00:49:25.636 --> 00:49:26.516]  These are all quotes.
[00:49:26.976 --> 00:49:39.859]  I mean, I've been playing for months, almost every day, compilations of them saying, impeach, imprison, kill Trump, kill his family, kill his supporters, intimidate everybody, sue everybody, have fake women coming forward saying they were raped.
[00:49:40.199 --> 00:49:41.539]  None of that's true, it turns out.
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:46.181]  Private Federal Reserve trying to crash the economy to kill the Trump recovery.
[00:49:47.201 --> 00:49:50.602]  Bill Maher saying they want to kill the recovery to teach Trump supporters a lesson.
[00:49:51.202 --> 00:49:52.443]  This is terrorism.
[00:49:52.523 --> 00:49:53.183]  It's economic.
[00:49:53.443 --> 00:49:54.043]  It's physical.
[00:49:54.303 --> 00:49:54.743]  It's threats.
[00:49:54.783 --> 00:49:56.024]  It's the definition of terrorism.
[00:49:56.804 --> 00:49:58.244]  Let's pull up the definition of terrorism.
[00:49:58.964 --> 00:50:06.426]  It's threatening violent acts or carrying out violent acts for a political aim.
[00:50:07.587 --> 00:50:08.547]  That is the definition.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.761]  And if that isn't what the Democrats and MSM are doing, I don't know what is.
[00:50:13.982 --> 00:50:18.503]  A use of violence or the threat of violence, especially against civilians in the pursuit of political goals.
[00:50:19.684 --> 00:50:22.125]  Resort to terrorizing methods as a means of coercion.
[00:50:22.145 --> 00:50:26.226]  A state of fear and submission produced by the prevalence of such methods.
[00:50:26.906 --> 00:50:31.168]  The act of terrorizing, a state of being terrorized, a mode of governance by terror intimidation.
[00:50:31.628 --> 00:50:37.710]  If you look at all the studies, I have a big stack up right here, I've covered this probably 20 times in the last few months, but I'll show it again later.
[00:50:38.531 --> 00:50:39.031]  Just type in.
[00:50:41.092 --> 00:50:45.414]  Studies show coverage of mass shootings causes the mass shootings.
[00:50:45.434 --> 00:50:49.576]  And they're always in cell Antifa that do it and they try to cover that up.
[00:50:53.138 --> 00:51:01.902]  And then they admit that Joker is meant to trigger an Antifa bloody uprising and glorifies randomly shooting people on the streets of their white or police officers.
[00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:19.181]  Everybody that sees it goes, wow, you're right, it's glorification of anti-fund killing everybody and all these beautiful losers, you know, going out and becoming more beautiful as little butterflies coming out of their chrysalis and murdering.
[00:51:22.203 --> 00:51:22.444]  Because
[00:51:23.578 --> 00:51:25.639]  There's known propaganda that overthrows countries.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:33.184]  And so Hollywood already hates America, so they're perfect to take billions in ChaiCom money, a quarter, to spew all of this.
[00:51:34.124 --> 00:51:38.767]  By the way, it's in the news that the big six Hollywood production houses are owned by ChaiComs.
[00:51:39.327 --> 00:51:41.028]  The other two or so are getting bought out.
[00:51:41.348 --> 00:51:42.449]  Trump blocked some of those.
[00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:49.333]  And it's in the news that Tencent, this giant Chinese ChaiCom company,
[00:51:51.172 --> 00:52:04.704]  Has 1.5 billion dollars and it's pulling that because a manager of the Rockets sent out a tweet saying he supported Hong Kong independence when they have a treaty that they shouldn't even be under China.
[00:52:05.765 --> 00:52:06.946]  That's the level of bullying.
[00:52:07.126 --> 00:52:11.690]  Oh, one person said something in your giant organization that has tens of thousands of employees.
[00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:16.154]  Because they want their control here leveraged against us.
[00:52:16.394 --> 00:52:18.796]  And of course he apologized and pissed all over himself.
[00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:22.372]  America and the world is at a crossroads.
[00:52:22.452 --> 00:52:23.533]  How much will you grovel?
[00:52:23.593 --> 00:52:28.017]  How much will you give in to just every special interest out there, including foreign authoritarian countries?
[00:52:28.177 --> 00:52:32.942]  And then Hillary tells us that Russia is running things.
[00:52:33.082 --> 00:52:38.187]  Putin says everywhere, we should not be involved in any of America's decisions or any of their politics or culture, but you stay out of ours.
[00:52:38.767 --> 00:52:40.349]  And I'm here to tell you, Russia is not involved.
[00:52:40.889 --> 00:52:41.910]  Other than in their interest.
[00:52:43.531 --> 00:52:44.873]  Putin's cut the spending.
[00:52:46.843 --> 00:52:49.326]  Putin's cut the spending for the military.
[00:52:49.606 --> 00:52:51.688]  He's cut intelligence funding massively.
[00:52:51.988 --> 00:52:52.969]  He says, I'm not fighting you.
[00:52:52.989 --> 00:52:55.932]  I know what you got planned.
[00:52:56.373 --> 00:52:57.654]  You're moving nukes up to our borders.
[00:52:57.694 --> 00:52:58.274]  I'm not going to do it.
[00:52:59.315 --> 00:53:00.697]  You're not going to bankrupt us with this.
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.623]  And then Putin helped us take out ISIS and al-Qaeda in Syria.
[00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:08.690]  It's admirable.
[00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:12.051]  And that's why Hillary and other globalists are so scared.
[00:53:12.511 --> 00:53:13.771]  Because they don't want real peace.
[00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:15.072]  And Trump wants real peace.
[00:53:15.452 --> 00:53:16.292]  With people that want it.
[00:53:16.892 --> 00:53:21.453]  But China is our adversary because it doesn't respect us because the globalists put them in power.
[00:53:21.673 --> 00:53:24.714]  And have used them as leverage to take us out economically and culturally.
[00:53:24.934 --> 00:53:25.854]  So which side are you on?
[00:53:25.874 --> 00:53:27.175]  Now I'm going to go to people that disagree.
[00:53:27.615 --> 00:53:27.975]  Brandon?
[00:53:27.995 --> 00:53:32.516]  I know we got phones loaded now.
[00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:38.333]  So just do me a favor, mark each one that disagrees so I go to them first.
[00:53:39.254 --> 00:53:47.101]  Bonnie's first, then Gerald, then Brandon, and there's one other that disagrees.
[00:53:47.121 --> 00:53:48.582]  So I'm going to go to you all first.
[00:53:49.443 --> 00:53:50.664]  You think Trump should be impeached?
[00:53:51.305 --> 00:53:56.169]  So let's go to Bonnie in Nevada first.
[00:53:56.229 --> 00:53:57.791]  Bonnie, thanks for calling.
[00:53:57.851 --> 00:53:58.151]  Welcome.
[00:53:59.032 --> 00:54:00.173]  Hi Alex, can you hear me?
[00:54:00.373 --> 00:54:01.034]  Yes I can, go ahead.
[00:54:01.834 --> 00:54:02.655]  Great, okay.
[00:54:03.055 --> 00:54:05.036]  Well, first I want to say that I'm a first-time caller.
[00:54:05.056 --> 00:54:06.277]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:54:06.297 --> 00:54:08.299]  And I'm a big supporter.
[00:54:08.359 --> 00:54:09.760]  I just am a new listener.
[00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:15.504]  I've only been listening a couple weeks, but I just bought a huge amount of stuff on your InfoWars shop, and I hope you stay around for a long, long time.
[00:54:16.485 --> 00:54:19.907]  So anyway, just to explain my thought processes here.
[00:54:20.487 --> 00:54:22.229]  I'm a big Trump supporter.
[00:54:22.289 --> 00:54:26.492]  I helped, you know, I actually worked for him to get him into office, and I don't think
[00:54:27.313 --> 00:54:31.337]  Um, that he should be, that there's anything that he's done yet that's impeachable.
[00:54:31.457 --> 00:54:40.225]  However, um, if, and I want to say this because my first husband is a retired military officer, is a retired U.S.
[00:54:40.285 --> 00:54:40.946]  pilot, U.S.
[00:54:41.006 --> 00:54:41.647]  Air Force pilot.
[00:54:42.147 --> 00:54:46.431]  Second husband's a retired chief in the Army, and I have a degree in political science.
[00:54:46.872 --> 00:54:50.435]  And this is what my first husband taught me, and I think he's correct.
[00:54:51.115 --> 00:54:58.217]  That you cannot, and this is, you know, you have said that he's planning on possibly using the United States Marines to stave off a coup.
[00:54:59.297 --> 00:55:01.558]  If that's true, that would be impeachable.
[00:55:01.918 --> 00:55:02.618]  And this is why.
[00:55:03.278 --> 00:55:09.079]  Because you cannot use the United States military on United States soil against United States citizens.
[00:55:09.619 --> 00:55:17.061]  His option for that would be, if he feels there's going to be a coup, his option for protection is the guard.
[00:55:17.721 --> 00:55:19.622]  He cannot use the United States military.
[00:55:19.662 --> 00:55:20.042]  That would be
[00:55:21.032 --> 00:55:25.436]  A violation of the Constitution and it would be an abuse of his power as Commander-in-Chief.
[00:55:25.456 --> 00:55:28.179]  Sure, you're saying it's a violation of posse comitatus?
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:33.484]  Yes, yes, and it would be disastrous for the country and for him.
[00:55:34.304 --> 00:55:41.571]  So what he needs to do, okay, and he should do if he feels there's going to be a coup, is by gosh, he's got the guard.
[00:55:42.031 --> 00:55:43.132]  He's got plenty of guard.
[00:55:43.473 --> 00:55:44.834]  He's got guard in every state.
[00:55:45.521 --> 00:55:46.402]  And he should use them.
[00:55:46.542 --> 00:55:48.384]  That's what his options are for that.
[00:55:48.404 --> 00:55:52.447]  But using the United States military would just be a total disaster.
[00:55:52.467 --> 00:55:54.089]  They're calling up Marine Reserves.
[00:55:54.489 --> 00:55:57.211]  But it's still the Marines.
[00:55:57.531 --> 00:56:00.794]  It's still the United States military and it's absolutely forbidden.
[00:56:01.135 --> 00:56:01.415]  Sure.
[00:56:01.615 --> 00:56:02.516]  Absolutely forbidden.
[00:56:03.339 --> 00:56:06.081]  Well, you're a smart lady, and I'm very honored to have you as a listener.
[00:56:07.802 --> 00:56:10.624]  I've written books on the police state.
[00:56:10.684 --> 00:56:12.305]  I've made films on it.
[00:56:12.966 --> 00:56:14.947]  And I'm absolutely against the police state.
[00:56:14.987 --> 00:56:20.732]  And I've had every constitutional lawyer you can imagine, from Edwin Vieira to you name it.
[00:56:20.752 --> 00:56:21.812]  I've had Rand Paul on.
[00:56:21.852 --> 00:56:22.713]  I've had Ron Paul on.
[00:56:22.753 --> 00:56:26.356]  And you know they're all against offensive wars.
[00:56:26.936 --> 00:56:32.360]  And I would think you'd agree with me that people like Ron Paul are against the police state, right?
[00:56:33.371 --> 00:56:35.012]  Yeah.
[00:56:35.312 --> 00:56:37.273]  And I am against the police state.
[00:56:37.333 --> 00:56:37.633]  Stay there.
[00:56:37.653 --> 00:56:38.433]  I'm going to come back to you.
[00:56:38.453 --> 00:56:39.254]  This is important, Bonnie.
[00:56:39.554 --> 00:56:40.014]  Don't hang up.
[00:56:40.074 --> 00:56:45.236]  Then Brandon, Gerald, and there's some others that disagree with the President as well.
[00:56:45.256 --> 00:56:47.117]  Then we'll have the phones open up for everybody.
[00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:52.660]  But this is really central because I want to explain something here when we come back, okay?
[00:56:53.626 --> 00:56:56.907]  This is not the Marines for law enforcement.
[00:56:57.527 --> 00:57:01.928]  This is the Marines protecting a branch of government under assault by a criminal group.
[00:57:02.208 --> 00:57:03.189]  I'll explain it when we come back.
[00:57:05.229 --> 00:57:06.210]  We've got open phones.
[00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:10.671]  President Trump has said that we're entering a civil war.
[00:57:12.511 --> 00:57:20.894]  The deep state globalists that literally hate this country are attempting to have government employees tell lies.
[00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:26.272]  Because they're in the Democratic Party and build a false consensus to remove him from office.
[00:57:26.292 --> 00:57:31.754]  They're now talking about using the 22nd Amendment by threatening his cabinet to remove him.
[00:57:32.094 --> 00:57:35.936]  They're now threatening to kill his cabinet or put them in prison if they don't do this.
[00:57:36.096 --> 00:57:41.018]  On the news, I've got all these videos where they fantasize about what prison cells they're going to put them in.
[00:57:41.579 --> 00:57:42.619]  This is terrorism!
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.641]  You better step down or I'm going to put you in prison.
[00:57:45.661 --> 00:57:46.281]  I'm going to kill you.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:59.890]  Now I totally agree that at the end of the Civil War we need to pass a law, Posse Comitatus, but it's already in the Bill of Rights that you shouldn't quarter troops amongst the people and we don't want a standing domestic army.
[00:58:00.471 --> 00:58:02.613]  And I'm against police states and everybody knows that.
[00:58:04.234 --> 00:58:05.195]  But I want to explain something.
[00:58:06.436 --> 00:58:14.183]  If Martians hypothetically invaded, and I don't think they're really invading before the news runs that headline, and were attacking the Pentagon.
[00:58:16.596 --> 00:58:21.139]  Well, then it would be the Marines, the Army, the Air Force, the Navy's job to defend the Pentagon.
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:26.182]  You wouldn't say, oh, posse comitatus, you can't have the military operating.
[00:58:26.442 --> 00:58:39.911]  Because it's not that you can't have the military operating on domestic soil, you can't have it involved with civilian law enforcement dealing with civilian laws and civilian courts, because it's not its jurisdiction.
[00:58:40.991 --> 00:58:44.454]  But when Mexican troops or cartels shoot,
[00:58:45.655 --> 00:58:55.341]  At citizens, or the border patrol, or shipping drugs in, it's the President's purview to put the Air Force, the Army, the Marines on the border.
[00:58:56.021 --> 00:59:13.191]  It's the National Guard that's called up by governors, or that an emergency is unified under the President to deal with an earthquake, or a tornado, or a hurricane, or a giant terror attack, or a bioweapons release, or a huge chemical plant that blows up.
[00:59:13.351 --> 00:59:14.772]  That's what we're talking about.
[00:59:15.814 --> 00:59:24.361]  And so I understand the lady's a political scientist, and she's had husbands that were in the government do these things, and I'm glad she's aware of posse comitatus.
[00:59:24.581 --> 00:59:25.141]  I really am.
[00:59:26.522 --> 00:59:43.556]  But I'm particularly aware, I've been, I was warned by people in the mid-1990s, Bill Clinton was trying to prepare a plan to actually take over governors and others if they resisted in a martial law scenario.
[00:59:44.312 --> 00:59:58.884]  That later came out that Clinton was looking at that, and I was told this by the Army, because they had Delta Force going around preparing this and doing this, and... Well, I'm not gonna go tell that whole story again.
[00:59:58.924 --> 01:00:04.128]  The point is, is that I've been all over this like flies on you-know-what, or white on rice.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.464]  It's the Democrats that have brought us this point.
[01:00:07.524 --> 01:00:13.816]  It's the deep state threatening and attacking and saying they're going to kill people and bringing forward fake information.
[01:00:13.896 --> 01:00:16.341]  And now they try to physically grab the president.
[01:00:17.657 --> 01:00:25.742]  He's checked with the Marines, they understand their history, and it's their job to protect the President if people try to take him in the United States extra-judicially.
[01:00:26.142 --> 01:00:36.027]  If they're having an impeachment, and they have the Senate vote, even if they twist and threaten people in the Senate, and it probably looks like it was a scam, I'll support it, because it's constitutional.
[01:00:36.047 --> 01:00:41.570]  It just means, you know, we're a bunch of cowards, and they got intimidated and threatened, and the branches of government failed us.
[01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:43.872]  But I wouldn't want Trump to become a dictator at that point.
[01:00:44.855 --> 01:00:47.657]  But I would want to remove those Senators and get somebody else elected.
[01:00:47.717 --> 01:00:53.442]  Because it would be too on the line to figure out exactly what happened and it would invite Trump behaving like a dictator.
[01:00:53.462 --> 01:00:54.303]  But he doesn't want to do that.
[01:00:54.603 --> 01:00:59.707]  He wants to turn the country around and sail off into the sunset and the Trump name be platinum.
[01:01:01.749 --> 01:01:06.613]  So what does the President do if they go in a 22nd Amendment coup and try to grab him?
[01:01:08.214 --> 01:01:09.456]  He's protected by the Marines.
[01:01:09.656 --> 01:01:10.957]  There's a reason that's going on.
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.083]  And the Marines aren't under posse comitatus in law, which I've said should be changed.
[01:01:17.564 --> 01:01:27.770]  But if you go into the actual details of it, because it deals with maritime and our borders, there is a special subsection that gives them an immunity because of the president again.
[01:01:29.011 --> 01:01:31.553]  Don't you know Congress would raise its own army if it couldn't take over?
[01:01:31.713 --> 01:01:32.574]  The courts would do it too.
[01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:35.375]  Probably have three branches of government who balance power.
[01:01:35.456 --> 01:01:37.477]  This is an attack on the executive branch.
[01:01:38.217 --> 01:01:40.459]  The globalists gave incredible power to the executive branch.
[01:01:41.963 --> 01:01:43.924]  Before Trump got in because it was their puppet.
[01:01:43.984 --> 01:01:45.025]  Now they're all freaked out.
[01:01:45.605 --> 01:01:48.447]  Trump got us out of WTO corruption and made them change.
[01:01:48.487 --> 01:01:50.088]  He got us out of the TPP.
[01:01:50.148 --> 01:01:53.851]  He did a whole bunch of stuff that was unprecedented using that power.
[01:01:53.911 --> 01:01:54.871]  That's why they're freaking out.
[01:01:55.231 --> 01:01:56.352]  He's been very judicious.
[01:01:56.372 --> 01:01:58.173]  I don't think he's been strong enough on censorship.
[01:01:58.554 --> 01:02:04.137]  If anything, he hasn't acted strong enough because he's faced with a very authoritarian attack.
[01:02:04.457 --> 01:02:08.500]  A constellation of terroristic thugs.
[01:02:10.162 --> 01:02:11.183]  Yeah, go ahead and blow that up for me.
[01:02:11.203 --> 01:02:12.244]  They found the subsection there.
[01:02:12.905 --> 01:02:20.052]  Although the Navy and Marine Corps are not included in the Act, they were made subject to it by DOD regulation, yeah, in 1992.
[01:02:20.792 --> 01:02:22.054]  But that's actually not in the Act.
[01:02:22.074 --> 01:02:25.757]  That's a regulation that can be overridden by the President or the Secretary of Defense.
[01:02:25.797 --> 01:02:26.758]  See, I've done my homework.
[01:02:27.098 --> 01:02:28.480]  I didn't have them just pull that to prove I'm right.
[01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:33.312]  This is all an issue of separation of powers.
[01:02:34.253 --> 01:02:40.240]  And if we really believe he's wrong, if they come after him and try to blow the White House up, they could try to kill him.
[01:02:40.581 --> 01:02:48.290]  If somebody tried to drive ammonium nitrate into the White House and it was driven by Phil Mudd, who says he wants to kill the President, would it be wrong for Marines to open fire on him?
[01:02:48.471 --> 01:02:50.013]  Would that be a violation of posse comitatus?
[01:02:50.962 --> 01:02:53.064]  I would say the National Guard still needs to be used.
[01:02:53.104 --> 01:02:58.488]  Okay, but if they're not there, it's Marines at the, and they're up there with anti-tank missiles on the roof.
[01:02:58.568 --> 01:03:01.270]  They are on top of the roof with anti-tank missiles, okay?
[01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:03.452]  And let's say Phil Mudd, they got anti-aircraft missiles.
[01:03:03.772 --> 01:03:07.415]  Phil Mudd has a jet aircraft and he's gonna fly it into the White House.
[01:03:07.615 --> 01:03:08.756]  He said he's gonna kill the President.
[01:03:08.976 --> 01:03:10.017]  He's going to stab Giuliani.
[01:03:10.297 --> 01:03:11.418]  So he's saying he's going to kill him.
[01:03:11.678 --> 01:03:12.940]  He's to run counter-terrorism.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:13.900]  So he has the means.
[01:03:14.201 --> 01:03:15.542]  He gets a jet, loads it up.
[01:03:15.622 --> 01:03:16.503]  He's a kamikaze.
[01:03:17.143 --> 01:03:20.867]  I guess the president just opens his chest up and says, Posse comitatus!
[01:03:21.207 --> 01:03:23.329]  And then Phil Mudd just flies the airplane into his chest.
[01:03:24.952 --> 01:03:30.155]  Why can't he mobilize the Guard right now to start to protect himself, rather than having to go to that extreme?
[01:03:30.815 --> 01:03:35.878]  Either way you look at it... Well, ma'am, just to be clear, I'm going to let you talk right now.
[01:03:35.898 --> 01:03:36.719]  We'll go to the calls at the break.
[01:03:37.179 --> 01:03:38.800]  I'm using a ridiculous hypothetical.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.581]  I'm saying it's the Marines guarding the White House.
[01:03:41.842 --> 01:03:43.102]  That's in the Constitution.
[01:03:43.663 --> 01:03:44.823]  It's not the National Guard.
[01:03:45.704 --> 01:03:46.244]  Please continue.
[01:03:48.145 --> 01:03:49.326]  Oh, you're talking to me?
[01:03:49.446 --> 01:03:50.367]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:03:50.387 --> 01:03:50.787]  I apologize.
[01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:52.291]  Okay, no, no.
[01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:54.933]  I just, it becomes a revolution.
[01:03:54.953 --> 01:03:57.716]  It becomes the same coup that we're trying to avoid.
[01:03:58.276 --> 01:04:00.818]  So, to me, it's the state.
[01:04:01.079 --> 01:04:02.360]  Remember the Rosa Parks thing?
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:07.584]  When they sent the guard down there to make sure that the law was followed, okay?
[01:04:07.624 --> 01:04:10.747]  When she couldn't, you know, the guard... You're absolutely right.
[01:04:11.068 --> 01:04:12.028]  That was the states.
[01:04:12.569 --> 01:04:16.212]  Why do you think it was the Marines that quietly stopped the attempted coup on FDR?
[01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:16.953]  That's their job.
[01:04:19.451 --> 01:04:21.833]  Well, I tell ya, it's a debatable issue, Alex.
[01:04:22.153 --> 01:04:28.699]  Have you ever heard, like they said, the President will send a squad of Marines down to grab somebody if the President wants to talk to somebody in an emergency?
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.784]  You understand the separation of powers, it's the purview that the Marines guard the President.
[01:04:33.824 --> 01:04:34.604]  You understand that, right?
[01:04:35.285 --> 01:04:37.387]  I can see it on a foreign soil, sure.
[01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:40.429]  If he's flying out on Air Force One and he's out in Libya or whatnot.
[01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:44.313]  But what if globalists have taken over America and have the President surrounded?
[01:04:45.034 --> 01:04:45.514]  But how do you?
[01:04:45.534 --> 01:04:47.516]  That's where everything becomes all muddy.
[01:04:47.556 --> 01:04:48.036]  How do you know?
[01:04:48.617 --> 01:04:51.919]  Because then the Dems could get in and do the same thing and say it about the Republicans.
[01:04:51.939 --> 01:04:52.520]  Ma'am, I agree.
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:57.264]  It is muddy because Phil Mudd used to run assassination teams and he's on TV saying he's going to kill the President.
[01:04:57.864 --> 01:05:02.188]  So when they're all saying they're going to kill him all over the news, he's activating the Marines in case they try it.
[01:05:02.228 --> 01:05:02.648]  That's all.
[01:05:02.888 --> 01:05:03.709]  Nothing offensive.
[01:05:03.969 --> 01:05:04.970]  He's just lifting a shield.
[01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:08.212]  As he told my confidant, his confidant, that he would do.
[01:05:08.532 --> 01:05:09.693]  But hey, great points, Bonnie.
[01:05:09.733 --> 01:05:10.894]  Love to have smart callers like you.
[01:05:10.914 --> 01:05:12.195]  I think you've got legitimate points.
[01:05:12.215 --> 01:05:12.955]  That's why we're debating it.
[01:05:13.035 --> 01:05:13.375]  Thank you.
[01:05:13.395 --> 01:05:13.996]  Call me back again.
[01:05:14.476 --> 01:05:16.317]  Gerald, Brandon, you disagreed with me as well.
[01:05:16.477 --> 01:05:18.119]  We'll talk to you straight ahead, then the rest of the callers.
[01:05:18.299 --> 01:05:18.719]  Stay with us.
[01:05:18.899 --> 01:05:19.680]  Infowars.com.
[01:05:22.421 --> 01:05:33.169]  All right, we're going to Brandon in Louisiana, then Gerald, then everybody else that has called in just on the general topic of impeachment of Trump and the Marines being activated for domestic emergency.
[01:05:34.474 --> 01:05:41.161]  Civil crisis, which will have little or no warning, sights, threats, the homeland.
[01:05:41.681 --> 01:05:48.788]  And this is all in this climate of martial law, civil war, impeachment, deep states saying they're going to kill the president.
[01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:53.573]  Out of control private intelligence agencies thinking they're God.
[01:05:55.014 --> 01:05:56.475]  These groups have totally sold us out.
[01:05:56.515 --> 01:06:05.963]  The NBA calling orders from the Communist Chinese to censure and maybe even fire a manager at the Rockets because he said on Twitter he supported Hong Kong protesters.
[01:06:07.324 --> 01:06:08.285]  That's globalism for you.
[01:06:08.305 --> 01:06:09.086]  That's the censorship.
[01:06:09.426 --> 01:06:12.228]  Alex Jones last year, now it's the Houston Rockets manager.
[01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:15.471]  Oh, you can't have any political views.
[01:06:17.756 --> 01:06:18.336]  Think about that.
[01:06:18.917 --> 01:06:31.405]  Oh, and the same company that basically bought Reddit for $150 million, Tencent, they're the ones involved pulling the $1.5 billion from the NBA deal being able to move into China because they didn't like what one employee of one company said.
[01:06:33.906 --> 01:06:34.927]  That'll teach everybody.
[01:06:35.467 --> 01:06:37.048]  That's where the left's censorship goes.
[01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:41.771]  So these callers are disagreeing with me.
[01:06:41.791 --> 01:06:42.452]  They're talking about
[01:06:43.373 --> 01:06:44.714]  Why Trump should be impeached?
[01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.076]  Well, she's saying if he uses the Marines.
[01:06:46.096 --> 01:06:48.618]  Well, I think if he uses the Marines to grab his enemies, he should be.
[01:06:48.678 --> 01:06:57.767]  But I'm talking about if, outside of government, just a rogue group comes at the president or announces he's being removed, who protects the president?
[01:06:57.787 --> 01:06:58.368]  It's the Marines.
[01:06:58.408 --> 01:06:59.069]  That's the whole point.
[01:06:59.429 --> 01:07:02.332]  So I think there's a misunderstanding here about posse comitatus.
[01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:07.457]  We're not saying the Marines are going to be running, you know, radar duty on the highway or any of that.
[01:07:09.417 --> 01:07:11.841]  This just shows where we are, how things have escalated.
[01:07:12.262 --> 01:07:15.147]  Let's go to Brandon and then Gerald.
[01:07:15.167 --> 01:07:17.971]  Brandon from Louisiana disagrees, says Trump needs to be impeached.
[01:07:18.011 --> 01:07:18.773]  Please tell me why.
[01:07:20.717 --> 01:07:21.738]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:07:21.758 --> 01:07:28.003]  I'd like to preface this by saying I'm a patriot, I'm a veteran, I'm a huge supporter of InfoWars, and I buy your products monthly.
[01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:28.604]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:29.765]  Sometimes bi-weekly.
[01:07:29.825 --> 01:07:30.465]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:07:31.486 --> 01:07:39.253]  I just want to jump straight to the chase that we've let this problem fester for the last three and a half years, and we should have taken action a long time ago.
[01:07:39.733 --> 01:07:48.380]  I understand that the President's surrounded by cowards and people like Phil Mudd who say that he's going to come after the President and do some really strange things to the President.
[01:07:50.074 --> 01:07:53.455]  I just, I wanted action a while ago.
[01:07:53.475 --> 01:07:55.996]  Like, I'll give you an analogy, Alex.
[01:07:56.116 --> 01:08:05.880]  If you had a flu or you had a really bad illness, you wouldn't lay in bed for, you know, weeks at a time until the illness took off your body and almost killed you and then go see the doctor.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:11.503]  You would get up when you started feeling funny or you had some symptoms and you would go take care of it.
[01:08:12.443 --> 01:08:13.443]  I'm trying to... No, you're right.
[01:08:13.463 --> 01:08:16.665]  That's exactly what I would do before I really got sick and couldn't get out of bed.
[01:08:16.685 --> 01:08:17.325]  You're absolutely right.
[01:08:18.345 --> 01:08:18.525]  Right.
[01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:23.428]  I'm trying to understand why we've got to this point, which is a rhetorical question.
[01:08:23.748 --> 01:08:26.510]  I do understand why we got to this point, because he's surrounded by cowards.
[01:08:27.150 --> 01:08:35.352]  But I want him to, I really want the solution to this problem, and you said this before, is that we should be having national press conferences.
[01:08:35.592 --> 01:08:40.174]  The president should have a national press conference detailing the amount of corruption that we're in.
[01:08:40.514 --> 01:08:44.395]  Because most people don't understand the amount, the level of corruption that we're up against.
[01:08:44.835 --> 01:08:48.096]  And he should be playing your videos on a national level.
[01:08:48.576 --> 01:08:52.397]  CNN and everybody will tune in because they can't survive without him for the ratings.
[01:08:53.197 --> 01:08:59.803]  He should be playing your videos and detailing what level of corruption we're in and how much money he's gonna... Well I think when you say that, he should support a new independent Twitter.
[01:08:59.883 --> 01:09:05.147]  He has the power still to take their power away, to stop the censorship, and to save this country.
[01:09:05.167 --> 01:09:08.790]  And I agree, he's not being hardcore enough because he doesn't want to panic the country.
[01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:11.692]  Well listen, they're taking that as a sign of weakness and they're moving against him.
[01:09:11.953 --> 01:09:16.296]  So you mean this tongue-in-cheek, because he hasn't done enough to protect himself and the country.
[01:09:16.857 --> 01:09:19.379]  If he's asking for it, hell then let him have it is what you're saying.
[01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:22.083]  That's right, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:09:22.563 --> 01:09:27.684]  I pray for you, I pray for the President, I pray for all Americans, the world.
[01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:30.585]  I don't want anything bad to happen to the President.
[01:09:30.605 --> 01:09:35.527]  I don't want anything bad to happen to you or I. But if we're watching somebody breaking our back door,
[01:09:36.258 --> 01:09:37.698]  And we don't engage that threat.
[01:09:38.019 --> 01:09:45.241]  And we let them go walk around the house and go through our safe and fondle our wife and go ahead and make a... And rape our kid's future?
[01:09:45.561 --> 01:09:47.422]  Or hell, kill our kid right in front of us.
[01:09:47.602 --> 01:09:49.162]  They're killing babies after they're born.
[01:09:49.182 --> 01:09:50.042]  No, you've got a great point.
[01:09:50.062 --> 01:09:51.783]  And I think the lady before was confused.
[01:09:51.803 --> 01:09:55.364]  We're not saying the Marines are going to run around and, you know, take people's guns.
[01:09:55.384 --> 01:09:56.604]  That's the Democrats saying that.
[01:09:58.385 --> 01:10:07.853]  I mean, Trump activating the Marines to protect himself, I think shows he realizes now how much danger he's in, and he has escalated his rhetoric, but I hope that moves into indictments quickly.
[01:10:07.893 --> 01:10:08.354]  God bless you.
[01:10:08.374 --> 01:10:09.254]  I appreciate your call, Brandon.
[01:10:09.555 --> 01:10:10.495]  So he didn't really disagree.
[01:10:10.536 --> 01:10:12.037]  But we got one person who really disagreed.
[01:10:13.358 --> 01:10:14.219]  But I get his point.
[01:10:14.239 --> 01:10:16.000]  I mean, I get mad at Trump, too.
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.602]  Gerald in New York disagrees.
[01:10:18.002 --> 01:10:19.804]  He says that Trump needs to be impeached.
[01:10:19.824 --> 01:10:20.104]  Go ahead.
[01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:21.651]  Hello, Alex.
[01:10:22.011 --> 01:10:22.371]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:22.972 --> 01:10:23.812]  How you doing, my brother?
[01:10:23.832 --> 01:10:24.233]  Good.
[01:10:24.273 --> 01:10:26.755]  Listen, I'm in Brooklyn, New York.
[01:10:26.875 --> 01:10:29.057]  I've been a long-time listener to the program.
[01:10:29.697 --> 01:10:32.399]  And, you know, I've been following what's going on with the president.
[01:10:32.459 --> 01:10:33.600]  I supported the president.
[01:10:34.161 --> 01:10:38.164]  But, man, the brother, he don't even know how to talk to the press.
[01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:40.966]  He don't know how to talk to his constituents.
[01:10:41.267 --> 01:10:44.669]  And they keep talking about low African-American unemployment.
[01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:48.813]  Man, I've been struggling with my auto mechanic business, trying to get that up and running.
[01:10:49.353 --> 01:10:54.316]  And every time that we're trying to move a step forward, the brother's taking two steps back.
[01:10:54.376 --> 01:10:55.636]  And I'm just confused.
[01:10:55.957 --> 01:10:57.357]  Is he supporting his people?
[01:10:57.377 --> 01:10:58.458]  Is he supporting himself?
[01:10:58.518 --> 01:10:59.478]  Where is he going with this?
[01:10:59.598 --> 01:11:00.319]  No, I hear you.
[01:11:00.519 --> 01:11:02.860]  The truth is, the economy was already in a depression, basically.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.061]  Trump got in and tried to fix it.
[01:11:04.381 --> 01:11:06.782]  The Federal Reserve raised interest rates eight times to block that.
[01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:09.524]  And, you know, the truth is, he can't get it all done.
[01:11:09.544 --> 01:11:11.004]  But, I mean, I hear you.
[01:11:11.024 --> 01:11:17.167]  I've got a lot of family who've got multiple degrees and, you know, they can't find good, decent jobs because we got sold out to China.
[01:11:18.672 --> 01:11:24.154]  He just came in when the ship was already sinking and a lot of us get pissed because he can't ride it fast enough.
[01:11:24.755 --> 01:11:27.376]  I just know this, the answer is he must go on the offense.
[01:11:27.776 --> 01:11:29.156]  We all must go on the offense.
[01:11:29.637 --> 01:11:31.357]  Very aggressively, legally and lawfully.
[01:11:31.958 --> 01:11:35.079]  Because the globalists are trying to intimidate us into submission right now.
[01:11:36.192 --> 01:11:39.676]  But you know, he let this stuff go on way too long with Joe Biden.
[01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:43.581]  He knows about Joe Biden over in the Ukraine with the funny business with Hunter.
[01:11:43.941 --> 01:11:49.108]  And also, he sees this coming with the whole Russian collusion from day one and he let that fester.
[01:11:49.148 --> 01:11:50.209]  He should have jumped on that.
[01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:52.332]  Brother, I hear you.
[01:11:52.472 --> 01:11:53.032]  God bless you.
[01:11:53.052 --> 01:11:53.813]  I appreciate your call.
[01:11:54.585 --> 01:11:59.169]  You know, you talk about trying to run your own auto repair business, and believe me, I know that's a tough business.
[01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:02.331]  I got a great crew that tries to do a great job, and they do.
[01:12:02.932 --> 01:12:06.875]  Nowadays, equipment, even at Fox News, I know folks, it's constantly breaking.
[01:12:06.895 --> 01:12:10.338]  There's just, there's regulation and bureaucrats come banging on the door.
[01:12:10.418 --> 01:12:13.080]  Believe me, imagine what it's like for Trump.
[01:12:13.961 --> 01:12:17.684]  And I'm not saying you want instant gratification, but
[01:12:19.147 --> 01:12:21.048]  Things are complex, but I agree with you.
[01:12:21.088 --> 01:12:25.370]  He better get way more aggressive or they're going to destroy him.
[01:12:26.671 --> 01:12:31.513]  He is overconfident sometimes, but that's a leadership trait.
[01:12:31.533 --> 01:12:33.514]  You know, Hillary's overconfident in a bad way.
[01:12:34.735 --> 01:12:35.475]  So I agree with you.
[01:12:35.515 --> 01:12:36.916]  We're in an insane time right now.
[01:12:37.056 --> 01:12:37.416]  Okay.
[01:12:38.257 --> 01:12:42.079]  We've got Al Killer, who's active duty Navy MP on Trump and the Marines.
[01:12:42.739 --> 01:12:44.500]  We're going to go to him in a moment.
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:46.181]  We've got Brad Impeachment.
[01:12:48.561 --> 01:12:49.361]  Would we accept it?
[01:12:49.401 --> 01:12:49.982]  That's a good question.
[01:12:50.002 --> 01:12:51.102]  What are we going to do if that happens?
[01:12:51.563 --> 01:12:52.223]  If they remove him?
[01:12:53.424 --> 01:12:54.905]  The Impeachment and Arrangement Syndrome?
[01:12:55.165 --> 01:12:58.286]  We'll talk to Dan, we'll talk to Will in Oregon, we'll talk to Joe, Alex, Jason.
[01:12:58.587 --> 01:12:59.247]  We'll get to everybody.
[01:12:59.267 --> 01:13:00.828]  We're going to come right back on the side of this break.
[01:13:01.308 --> 01:13:03.669]  And then we'll just take calls with Mike Adams right through the next hour.
[01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:06.531]  I'm going to get to everybody.
[01:13:06.551 --> 01:13:07.151]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:13:07.171 --> 01:13:07.511]  877-789-2539.
[01:13:09.493 --> 01:13:14.075]  You heard the last caller, before the last one, talking about supporting the broadcast.
[01:13:14.355 --> 01:13:17.037]  And thank you very much, sir, from Louisiana, for supporting us.
[01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:19.891]  We make it very, very easy to support us.
[01:13:19.931 --> 01:13:23.434]  We have great fluoride-free toothpaste, four to five o'clock silver and iodine.
[01:13:23.894 --> 01:13:24.655]  It's 50% off.
[01:13:24.715 --> 01:13:27.998]  We have the very best turmeric, 95% curcuminoid.
[01:13:28.038 --> 01:13:29.739]  Nobody else has that that we know of.
[01:13:30.359 --> 01:13:36.885]  Most brands have 5% and that still really helps with inflammation and just so many other things as an antioxidant.
[01:13:36.965 --> 01:13:38.486]  It's just, it's magic.
[01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:40.731]  We have the best krill oil.
[01:13:40.751 --> 01:13:41.793]  We have the best fish oil.
[01:13:41.813 --> 01:13:44.176]  We have the best honor roll for children.
[01:13:44.577 --> 01:13:46.619]  We have the very best bone broth.
[01:13:46.659 --> 01:13:49.804]  It's the strongest, best organic chicken bone broth.
[01:13:50.244 --> 01:13:53.709]  It's got to be like the equivalent of like 20 bowls of chicken broth without the calories.
[01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:55.070]  All right.
[01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:55.891]  Thank you so much.
[01:14:13.945 --> 01:14:16.086]  And we won't have more until probably four or five months in the next year.
[01:14:16.126 --> 01:14:17.948]  I'm not going to order more until it sells out.
[01:14:17.968 --> 01:14:20.689]  Then it takes about four or five months to get an order back in.
[01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:22.471]  So that's available at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:14:22.511 --> 01:14:25.413]  I had to extend the Super Sale just a few more days.
[01:14:25.713 --> 01:14:27.954]  Black Friday comes early because I've been so busy.
[01:14:27.974 --> 01:14:30.376]  I haven't come up with a new sale yet, but this is our best since Christmas.
[01:14:30.676 --> 01:14:34.278]  Storewide free shipping, 50% off, double page rate points and a lot of other big specials.
[01:14:34.699 --> 01:14:35.819]  So thank you all for your support.
[01:14:35.859 --> 01:14:40.723]  Take advantage of it now and fund the Second American Revolution worldwide at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:14:40.743 --> 01:14:41.023]  Thank you.
[01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:48.032]  We represent the organic human resistance to tyranny.
[01:14:49.793 --> 01:14:52.614]  We grew right out of the Texas soil with your support.
[01:14:54.294 --> 01:14:55.775]  We are 100% authentic.
[01:14:56.615 --> 01:14:58.616]  The globalists are 100% inauthentic.
[01:14:59.396 --> 01:15:00.157]  We are human.
[01:15:01.177 --> 01:15:02.337]  We believe in a human future.
[01:15:03.178 --> 01:15:05.959]  And we believe in God our creator will lead God and direct us.
[01:15:06.479 --> 01:15:08.360]  We open ourselves up for the transmissions.
[01:15:09.784 --> 01:15:12.785]  The Holy Spirit to guide us against the enemy and we will win.
[01:15:13.125 --> 01:15:14.206]  We have the top general.
[01:15:15.186 --> 01:15:16.527]  But that general gave us free will.
[01:15:18.227 --> 01:15:18.627]  All right.
[01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:20.108]  You see this on screen right over here?
[01:15:21.568 --> 01:15:23.169]  Exclusive Trump activates U.S.
[01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:27.271]  Marine reserves for emergency within the United States to stop illegal coup.
[01:15:27.951 --> 01:15:29.671]  Read the Marine Corps documents for yourself.
[01:15:31.072 --> 01:15:33.813]  It's at newswars.com and infowars.com with direct links to it.
[01:15:33.833 --> 01:15:35.153]  We're going to write back to your phone calls.
[01:15:35.213 --> 01:15:36.954]  And Mike Adams is going to be on next hour.
[01:15:36.974 --> 01:15:39.055]  We'll take calls with him as well on this key subject.
[01:15:40.612 --> 01:15:41.593]  Now, I want to explain something.
[01:15:43.975 --> 01:15:52.522]  When you see a coup in Guatemala or a coup in Venezuela or a coup in Turkey, you'll have a government faction backed by normally an offshore group.
[01:15:54.144 --> 01:15:55.865]  Sometimes they're a good coup, sometimes they're a bad coup.
[01:15:55.885 --> 01:16:01.310]  Sometimes they're trying to overthrow a dictator, sometimes they're trying to overthrow an election of a good president, like we see here.
[01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:06.955]  And it's all about who can get control of the media and who can announce that it's legitimate
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:13.523]  And then who can get the president or prime minister or dictator, in the case of Venezuela, out of power?
[01:16:14.543 --> 01:16:26.870]  And is the president dug in with security services he can trust while he gets a message out explaining, hey, Congress didn't impeach me, this isn't constitutional, this is illegal, I'm fine, I'm not mentally ill?
[01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:30.712]  What they'll try to do is drug him, is how this will work, one of the ways.
[01:16:31.312 --> 01:16:35.375]  They could try to drug him, then say he's gone insane, say he's having seizures,
[01:16:36.255 --> 01:16:37.315]  Say he's in the hospital.
[01:16:37.836 --> 01:16:43.437]  They could obviously shoot his vehicle with an anti-tank missile, blow his helicopter up with an anti-aircraft missile.
[01:16:43.918 --> 01:16:44.958]  It'll be an inside job.
[01:16:45.738 --> 01:16:47.819]  I mean, they're saying they're going to kill him.
[01:16:48.479 --> 01:16:56.382]  So I think this is overdue, him activating the Marines for the homeland to protect the executive branch from rogue elements.
[01:16:57.518 --> 01:17:09.470]  in the government that are on national TV and control the media because it's foreign-owned saying he's illegitimate and a traitor and a criminal when they are illegitimate and they are the liars and they are the traitors and they are the criminals.
[01:17:11.886 --> 01:17:16.448]  So InfoWars 25 years was built and made for this moment we're entering right now.
[01:17:16.968 --> 01:17:18.889]  And you notice we're just hitting our stride now.
[01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:24.491]  Our afterburners are hitting, our final boosters to go to the next level right as this is all unfolding.
[01:17:24.551 --> 01:17:25.111]  It's God's plan.
[01:17:25.811 --> 01:17:26.992]  You're in God's plan as well.
[01:17:27.452 --> 01:17:31.093]  So it's frustrating to see all this evil and to know all this and to not see more action.
[01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:32.214]  But remember, you're awake.
[01:17:34.502 --> 01:17:38.625]  And so, the takedown of the Globals is going to take longer, but it's exponential.
[01:17:38.665 --> 01:17:40.807]  That's why they're having to censor, it's why they're trying to do all this.
[01:17:41.047 --> 01:17:43.569]  The Chi-Coms are now trying to censor open U.S.
[01:17:43.629 --> 01:17:47.032]  media, the National Basketball League.
[01:17:49.995 --> 01:17:50.775]  This is the awakening.
[01:17:51.396 --> 01:17:53.017]  The NFL is trying to hide it.
[01:17:53.157 --> 01:17:56.180]  Reportedly, they're more than half down in ticket sales.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:56.980]  Their ratings are down 40%.
[01:17:57.861 --> 01:18:02.024]  Because they tried to tell America to suck commie weenie.
[01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:06.111]  Excuse my French, but it's not going to happen.
[01:18:06.931 --> 01:18:22.277]  They may have a bunch of zombies in San Francisco and some areas in New York, not knowing what planet they're on, ladies and gentlemen, but the rest of us, whether we're black, white, old, young, got our damn heads screwed on half straight, and we're not going to bend over to a bunch of globalist BS.
[01:18:24.798 --> 01:18:31.200]  My God, now managers of basketball teams can't even say they support people that are being invaded by the Chicoms?
[01:18:32.093 --> 01:18:33.094]  That's how far we've come?
[01:18:33.895 --> 01:18:35.476]  Big article up on Infowars.com.
[01:18:35.776 --> 01:18:36.918]  Then they came for Joe Rogan.
[01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:38.279]  Got a big report I shot last night.
[01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:39.400]  It's premiering right now.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.101]  Go see it.
[01:18:40.141 --> 01:18:40.621]  Go share it.
[01:18:41.242 --> 01:18:42.162]  They're now censoring him.
[01:18:42.503 --> 01:18:42.983]  Told him that.
[01:18:43.003 --> 01:18:46.246]  Let's go back to your phone calls right now.
[01:18:46.446 --> 01:18:48.388]  Owl Killer is active duty Navy.
[01:18:48.408 --> 01:18:49.970]  Should have gone to them first in case they're at work.
[01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:52.152]  And an MP on Trump and the Marines.
[01:18:52.973 --> 01:18:54.294]  Owl Killer, what's your take on this?
[01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:57.733]  Well, Alex, first I just want to say it's great to be back talking to you.
[01:18:57.753 --> 01:19:00.835]  I've been overseas the last two years, so I've been unable to call in.
[01:19:00.855 --> 01:19:02.036]  I remember you calling years ago.
[01:19:02.096 --> 01:19:03.116]  Welcome back, Owl Killer.
[01:19:03.557 --> 01:19:04.117]  Absolutely.
[01:19:04.197 --> 01:19:07.499]  So, and no, I'm on leave right now, but I'll be going back tomorrow.
[01:19:07.599 --> 01:19:10.401]  So I have plenty of time to talk, but so let's go.
[01:19:10.982 --> 01:19:14.944]  We'll start with President Trump activating the Marine Reserve.
[01:19:16.025 --> 01:19:17.706]  You had about three callers back.
[01:19:17.726 --> 01:19:18.947]  You had somebody mentioned that
[01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:24.772]  The United States Navy and Marine Corps are not under the posse comitatus, and that's exactly right.
[01:19:24.892 --> 01:19:26.713]  We were not even supposed to have a standing army.
[01:19:27.093 --> 01:19:30.334]  The Navy is the only constitutional military branch.
[01:19:30.354 --> 01:19:36.496]  It has every right to activate the United States Marine Reserve for any purpose he wants.
[01:19:37.797 --> 01:19:38.417]  That's right.
[01:19:38.457 --> 01:19:41.058]  It's in the Constitution that that's the only standing military.
[01:19:41.538 --> 01:19:41.958]  Exactly.
[01:19:42.018 --> 01:19:43.759]  And that is off top.
[01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:46.340]  He's completely justified in doing what he's doing.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:48.581]  Obviously, we don't want the
[01:19:49.491 --> 01:19:53.971]  The slippery slope is what we don't want, but President Trump is not going to go there.
[01:19:54.281 --> 01:19:57.682]  Well, it's the globalists saying, kill the president, overthrow everyone.
[01:19:58.022 --> 01:20:04.403]  Since they're the ones already overthrowing the country, so in a way, if he doesn't start taking action against him, it's a dereliction of duty.
[01:20:04.463 --> 01:20:04.863]  I'm sorry.
[01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:06.323]  And that's what the other caller was saying.
[01:20:06.544 --> 01:20:10.084]  If Trump doesn't really start moving against him, then he's letting them do this to us.
[01:20:10.124 --> 01:20:11.365]  And I'm not trying to be mean to the president.
[01:20:11.565 --> 01:20:15.585]  He's surrounded by a bunch of cowards, but we're here to tell him the American people aren't cowards.
[01:20:15.925 --> 01:20:16.946]  We don't want him to resign.
[01:20:16.986 --> 01:20:19.186]  We don't want him to step down, because that's what they're threatening to do.
[01:20:19.206 --> 01:20:20.526]  I meant to start the show with this.
[01:20:21.127 --> 01:20:21.787]  And I'll go back to you, sir.
[01:20:21.827 --> 01:20:22.007]  I'm sorry.
[01:20:23.707 --> 01:20:24.688]  Uh, and I'll play it next hour.
[01:20:24.948 --> 01:20:28.049]  Uh, Joy Reed, they're all over ABC, NBC, MSNBC.
[01:20:28.509 --> 01:20:31.810]  The new talking point is, resign or we'll cause a civil war.
[01:20:32.131 --> 01:20:33.691]  So that's the terrorism I'm talking about.
[01:20:33.731 --> 01:20:36.552]  We need to be calling the White House and everything else saying, do not resign.
[01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:39.874]  We're ready to, to, to, to, to go to whatever we have to.
[01:20:40.094 --> 01:20:41.874]  We're not going to start the fight like Bunker Hill.
[01:20:42.195 --> 01:20:44.696]  But if they came looking for a war, they're going to get one.
[01:20:44.876 --> 01:20:45.476]  Are you ready?
[01:20:45.496 --> 01:20:47.897]  And here, here's the other thing.
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:50.481]  I'm asking you a question, Al Killer.
[01:20:50.561 --> 01:20:52.723]  Are you ready and the people you know in the military?
[01:20:52.883 --> 01:20:54.465]  I will give my life right now.
[01:20:54.645 --> 01:21:01.811]  I would pour gasoline on me to paraphrase the great Lieutenant Colonel Allen West and light a match on it for this Republic and for this country and for my God.
[01:21:01.851 --> 01:21:02.411]  Me too.
[01:21:03.252 --> 01:21:06.134]  Because it's about not letting these damn child molesters have their way anymore.
[01:21:06.154 --> 01:21:07.035]  It's about fighting evil.
[01:21:07.535 --> 01:21:07.936]  Exactly.
[01:21:08.156 --> 01:21:11.018]  I called the FBI last night after your show about Phil Mudd.
[01:21:11.038 --> 01:21:12.480]  We're talking about sticking a shiv in
[01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:15.657]  Ex-Mayor Giuliani's back.
[01:21:16.097 --> 01:21:17.058]  Everybody needs to do it.
[01:21:17.178 --> 01:21:21.620]  I did the same thing when he threatened to say that the President would be killed two or three years ago.
[01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:23.982]  Right after listening to your show, I called the FBI.
[01:21:24.482 --> 01:21:26.263]  Everybody should flood the lines.
[01:21:26.683 --> 01:21:33.347]  We're not going to have a bunch of unelected bureaucrats threatening our President or any other citizens that are sticking up for him.
[01:21:33.387 --> 01:21:35.568]  And remember, Mudd ran the kill teams.
[01:21:35.628 --> 01:21:36.829]  He never did it himself.
[01:21:36.869 --> 01:21:37.730]  He's a pencil pusher.
[01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:41.692]  But this is a guy that ran assassination squads saying he's going to kill the President.
[01:21:42.256 --> 01:21:48.741]  And another guy, as Gerald Cilente says, can't run up a flight of stairs, can't punch a swive or paper bag that sends other people to do the dirty work.
[01:21:50.722 --> 01:21:54.005]  He's got a lot of nerve, and he's there to get people to believe that they're in charge.
[01:21:54.045 --> 01:21:54.685]  He's not, is he?
[01:21:55.306 --> 01:21:57.588]  If they were in charge, they wouldn't be out there talking.
[01:21:59.449 --> 01:22:09.917]  If people don't understand what is going on, with all these ex-spooks and intelligence agents on the mainstream media,
[01:22:10.623 --> 01:22:14.145]  How more obvious does it have to be what is going on here?
[01:22:14.645 --> 01:22:15.605]  And I want to tell you something.
[01:22:16.325 --> 01:22:19.627]  Lee Stranahan has everything nailed down.
[01:22:20.087 --> 01:22:35.653]  He was just talking about a New York Times article, or it could be Washington Post or Washington Times, I could be wrong, from about a month before President Kennedy was assassinated, saying that if any agency was going to carry out a coup, it would be the CIA.
[01:22:37.554 --> 01:22:39.095]  Yeah, that was a New York Times interview.
[01:22:39.115 --> 01:22:39.756]  I've seen that.
[01:22:39.776 --> 01:22:41.237]  I almost covered that last week.
[01:22:41.257 --> 01:22:42.338]  We should get Lee Stranahan back on.
[01:22:42.358 --> 01:22:43.138]  He's a really smart guy.
[01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:47.001]  Where Kennedy was saying the CIA may basically engage in a coup against me.
[01:22:47.522 --> 01:22:49.763]  And again, it's the criminals at the top of it that run it.
[01:22:49.963 --> 01:22:51.104]  I'm not defending the agency.
[01:22:51.284 --> 01:22:53.366]  It's just if you say the whole thing, I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:22:53.746 --> 01:22:56.408]  It's the people running it believe they own this country.
[01:22:57.329 --> 01:22:59.971]  Appointees that are there to be the managers.
[01:23:00.498 --> 01:23:04.779]  With the blackmail, that they could tell the agents what to do and keep them compartmentalized.
[01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:10.260]  That's why they're political appointees, so they don't go after what's really going on.
[01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:14.900]  I hate when Hannity says the 99% or whatever with the FBI.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.221]  Of course we understand that.
[01:23:17.301 --> 01:23:20.561]  That the people that are on the ground are the people really doing the work.
[01:23:21.122 --> 01:23:28.043]  But nobody says anything or does anything about these unelected people on TV and on top of these agencies.
[01:23:28.083 --> 01:23:29.603]  Like, how is Hillary Clinton
[01:23:30.245 --> 01:23:31.045]  Not behind bars.
[01:23:31.245 --> 01:23:31.986]  It's insane.
[01:23:32.046 --> 01:23:32.526]  Well, that's it.
[01:23:32.546 --> 01:23:35.467]  And that's why they're so arrogant and that's why they think they're so powerful.
[01:23:35.888 --> 01:23:39.029]  That's why they think, hey, we've had control forever, so we can do whatever we want.
[01:23:39.069 --> 01:23:40.189]  God bless you, Al Killer.
[01:23:40.209 --> 01:23:40.870]  Good to hear from you.
[01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:44.191]  All right, let's jam in one more before we go to break, then we'll hold them over as well.
[01:23:44.971 --> 01:23:46.152]  Let's talk to Dan in Texas.
[01:23:46.172 --> 01:23:47.332]  Dan, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:23:48.673 --> 01:23:49.674]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[01:23:49.774 --> 01:23:50.334]  I love your show.
[01:23:50.614 --> 01:23:50.794]  Thank you.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:55.902]  Yeah, hey, I just wanted to kind of recap and touch on a couple of different subjects.
[01:23:56.622 --> 01:24:03.585]  One being, where does the line actually stop and begin from where you have a mainstream media outlet calling for
[01:24:04.563 --> 01:24:08.587]  Um, any kind of violence against, say, President Trump or any of this.
[01:24:08.687 --> 01:24:12.070]  It seems like they're pushing this narrative more and more.
[01:24:12.090 --> 01:24:13.130]  Oh, well, that's it.
[01:24:13.170 --> 01:24:20.216]  They're normalizing that they're getting ready to grab him or kill him or say they had to do it and then threaten everybody else to just go along with it.
[01:24:20.477 --> 01:24:26.402]  They're actually test... You know how a parent will put its beak out to test a branch to see if the branch will hold it?
[01:24:26.722 --> 01:24:28.664]  These bastards, these pieces of filth,
[01:24:29.284 --> 01:24:30.905]  I know a lot of good folks that come from single parents.
[01:24:30.945 --> 01:24:33.966]  That's not a nice name to call bastards, you know.
[01:24:34.006 --> 01:24:41.850]  These pieces of roach filth are testing the waters to kill Trump, and then they're saying, and we're going to come after all his supporters.
[01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:43.751]  Well, guess what, jackasses?
[01:24:44.572 --> 01:24:46.212]  I mean, I'm tired of talking with these people.
[01:24:46.533 --> 01:24:48.554]  You little chicken-necked son of a... You know what?
[01:24:48.954 --> 01:24:53.696]  Phil Mudd and all them have got some big problems on their hands, and they better back off right now.
[01:24:54.516 --> 01:24:55.277]  That's not a threat.
[01:24:56.237 --> 01:24:57.638]  You're going to get their asses handed to them.
[01:24:57.658 --> 01:24:58.798]  They keep pushing this crap.
[01:24:59.098 --> 01:24:59.719]  You want a war?
[01:24:59.739 --> 01:25:00.839]  You're going to get one, son!
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.101]  Well, it's an epic time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:05.221 --> 01:25:07.642]  And Mike Adams, investigative journalist, par excellence.
[01:25:08.043 --> 01:25:09.163]  Somebody arrived with a shotgun with us.
[01:25:09.223 --> 01:25:10.384]  And Gerald Salente is coming up.
[01:25:10.404 --> 01:25:11.904]  We're going to get Lee Stranahan on tomorrow.
[01:25:12.965 --> 01:25:14.786]  He's making a lot of really great points as well.
[01:25:14.806 --> 01:25:16.527]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[01:25:17.187 --> 01:25:18.628]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:25:18.888 --> 01:25:19.368]  Hmm.
[01:25:20.268 --> 01:25:21.049]  That would be...
[01:25:24.485 --> 01:25:26.046]  Well, we'll go to Brian in Wisconsin.
[01:25:26.066 --> 01:25:27.387]  We'll go to Brad in Boston.
[01:25:27.407 --> 01:25:30.729]  But right now, Jason in Michigan has been holding the longest.
[01:25:31.129 --> 01:25:32.010]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:25:32.050 --> 01:25:32.570]  Welcome, sir.
[01:25:34.952 --> 01:25:41.136]  So, I think when it comes to impeachment, the one thing no one's brought up is Julian Assange.
[01:25:42.256 --> 01:25:44.978]  And to me, that's probably the most important.
[01:25:45.699 --> 01:25:52.063]  And the reason being is, without Julian Assange, there's no InfoWars.
[01:25:53.286 --> 01:25:59.930]  Alex Jones would probably be in jail right now, along with Rob Dew, along with Paul Watson.
[01:26:00.711 --> 01:26:13.298]  In fact, if I remember correctly, didn't you just release classified information about Obama setting up prison camps within China?
[01:26:13.518 --> 01:26:15.099]  Yep, I sure did.
[01:26:15.179 --> 01:26:20.142]  The weird thing is, is Julian Assange does it, and he loses everything.
[01:26:20.943 --> 01:26:21.383]  Everything.
[01:26:22.204 --> 01:26:22.784]  You do it.
[01:26:23.641 --> 01:26:25.401]  And the money keeps pouring in.
[01:26:26.182 --> 01:26:27.382]  Maybe you can explain that.
[01:26:28.142 --> 01:26:29.942]  Well, sir, we didn't screen your call.
[01:26:30.062 --> 01:26:32.003]  You're here, so there's not any nebulous stuff.
[01:26:32.323 --> 01:26:34.283]  If you want to accuse me of something, just go ahead and do it.
[01:26:34.323 --> 01:26:35.083]  What are you accusing me of?
[01:26:35.803 --> 01:26:36.984]  I just gave you facts.
[01:26:37.584 --> 01:26:43.285]  You released classified information to your 40 million listeners, and nothing happens to you.
[01:26:43.885 --> 01:26:46.886]  Julian Assange did it, which saved your career.
[01:26:46.906 --> 01:26:49.006]  It probably saved your life.
[01:26:50.077 --> 01:26:54.118]  And for some reason you're able to release classified information.
[01:26:54.278 --> 01:26:55.279]  Listen, I don't like this.
[01:26:55.599 --> 01:26:57.679]  I don't like this snake eats his tail thing, sir.
[01:26:58.199 --> 01:27:10.383]  I've said that the biggest thing Trump's done bad is tell Julian Assange or whoever's got the WikiLeaks, he said, release the WikiLeaks and then they turn the crime into releasing it instead of the crimes Hillary committed and I have had petitions
[01:27:11.443 --> 01:27:12.523]  And mailed them to the White House.
[01:27:12.543 --> 01:27:14.004]  We got like 50,000 signatures.
[01:27:14.044 --> 01:27:14.844]  We mailed them there.
[01:27:14.884 --> 01:27:15.884]  We sent digital copies.
[01:27:15.924 --> 01:27:17.084]  I've written hundreds of articles.
[01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:22.746]  It's come out in Google documents that they want me off the air because I support Julian Assange and whistleblowers.
[01:27:22.866 --> 01:27:26.927]  Obama waged unprecedented war on whistleblowers and on the press.
[01:27:27.007 --> 01:27:30.028]  Trump hasn't, except he hasn't helped Assange, and that's wrong.
[01:27:30.308 --> 01:27:34.289]  And if Trump can be impeached for anything, and I'm not calling for that, is that he didn't stand up for Assange.
[01:27:34.329 --> 01:27:39.170]  Now, just in case you know, I got sued 31 times by Democrat Party law firms, Hillary running it.
[01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:41.292]  I have had them try to take my kids away.
[01:27:41.312 --> 01:27:49.139]  I get followed around by the New York Times Pulitzer Prize winning disinfo lady that took down... Who's the guy that took off...
[01:27:50.094 --> 01:27:50.714]  Bill O'Reilly.
[01:27:51.135 --> 01:27:55.458]  I mean, I've got them all over me and stuff I can't mention on air for security reasons.
[01:27:55.498 --> 01:27:56.419]  I have to have security.
[01:27:56.839 --> 01:27:58.600]  And you're acting like I'm the establishment.
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:01.022]  There's press all the time releasing secret stuff.
[01:28:01.402 --> 01:28:04.825]  As long as it's illegal what you're exposing or bad, it's good and you're covered.
[01:28:05.225 --> 01:28:07.306]  Whistleblower protections are very, very important.
[01:28:07.687 --> 01:28:11.029]  And what's happened to Assange getting grabbed in Europe and going to this black hole is wrong.
[01:28:11.289 --> 01:28:12.710]  And I've been exposing it from the beginning.
[01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:15.492]  So it's not fair, unless you just tuned in for the first time.
[01:28:16.053 --> 01:28:18.134]  People call up and say, you're not covering the private Federal Reserve.
[01:28:18.154 --> 01:28:18.895]  What are you talking about?
[01:28:19.215 --> 01:28:21.217]  You're not covering, uh, chemtrails.
[01:28:21.257 --> 01:28:22.358]  I was one of the first to cover it.
[01:28:22.418 --> 01:28:27.763]  So, it's just not a fair statement to call in and imply, I'm a bad guy, why am I still on air?
[01:28:28.023 --> 01:28:32.727]  Well, they're trying to get me off air, and then once I don't have a platform, the plan is to put me in prison.
[01:28:32.927 --> 01:28:33.588]  They've said that.
[01:28:33.908 --> 01:28:38.893]  First they destroy you with a straw man, then they silence you, then they railroad your ass into prison.
[01:28:39.153 --> 01:28:41.475]  And sir, did you not know they planted child porn on us?
[01:28:41.875 --> 01:28:43.517]  Tried to put me in prison just three months ago?
[01:28:44.178 --> 01:28:45.399]  Did you know that, Jason?
[01:28:46.673 --> 01:28:47.213]  How come?
[01:28:47.674 --> 01:28:49.715]  Hey Jason, you're nothing but a punk!
[01:28:50.376 --> 01:28:51.336]  I'm the real deal!
[01:28:51.697 --> 01:28:53.198]  I'm absolutely bonafide!
[01:28:53.418 --> 01:28:56.480]  I'm 100% authentic and real!
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.482]  And I've been around longer than Julian Assange!
[01:28:58.642 --> 01:29:00.323]  And my audience has kicked total ass!
[01:29:00.483 --> 01:29:04.086]  And we brought the entire movement against the globalists and the information war!
[01:29:04.446 --> 01:29:06.487]  So you sit there calling up with that BS?
[01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:07.608]  You just hate me!
[01:29:07.908 --> 01:29:08.669]  You're a leftist!
[01:29:08.889 --> 01:29:10.010]  You're a democrat, aren't you?
[01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:10.951]  You hate Trump!
[01:29:11.151 --> 01:29:12.272]  Tell me you hate Trump, Jason!
[01:29:13.032 --> 01:29:13.913]  Pays for you!
[01:29:14.214 --> 01:29:15.735]  Your money doesn't- Ah, hold on a minute!
[01:29:15.796 --> 01:29:18.659]  Notice he wouldn't call in when we said call in and disagree.
[01:29:18.879 --> 01:29:19.820]  He's a deceiver!
[01:29:20.561 --> 01:29:21.422]  He's a liar!
[01:29:21.963 --> 01:29:22.804]  Hey, Jason!
[01:29:24.045 --> 01:29:25.948]  I know you want to piss on my grave, brother.
[01:29:25.968 --> 01:29:27.069]  I know you want to see me in prison.
[01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:30.173]  But God's on my side and the listeners are on my side, so we'll see what happens.
[01:29:30.694 --> 01:29:32.416]  You little deceiving rat liar!
[01:29:33.592 --> 01:29:34.192]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:29:34.693 --> 01:29:35.473]  You called in.
[01:29:35.553 --> 01:29:36.674]  You played your fake hand.
[01:29:36.714 --> 01:29:37.615]  You're full of crap.
[01:29:38.155 --> 01:29:39.557]  I've done nothing but support Assange.
[01:29:40.037 --> 01:29:41.718]  So everything you said is a lie.
[01:29:41.998 --> 01:29:44.180]  You hate me because you're of your father the devil.
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:45.181]  I can smell it.
[01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:51.001]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:29:51.041 --> 01:29:54.063]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Live Monday Show.
[01:29:54.864 --> 01:29:57.385]  Trump has the deep state trying to take him out right now.
[01:29:57.425 --> 01:30:01.348]  They're openly saying they're going to kill him, they're going to kill Giuliani on the news.
[01:30:01.508 --> 01:30:09.394]  And now, coming up next segment, I'm going to play clips of Joy Reid and others fantasizing about how they're going to threaten his
[01:30:10.995 --> 01:30:13.297]  So what they're doing is they're telegraphing the message
[01:30:26.547 --> 01:30:29.689]  To Trump, give up and we'll let you go.
[01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:43.539]  Make a deal with us so that you don't win the next election and so we can discredit everything and discredit the American populist movement and continue rolling forward with the censorship, the open borders, the gun confiscation, the mask is off.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:45.761]  We'll continue with your calls as well.
[01:30:45.901 --> 01:30:51.325]  Brad and Brian and Nathan and Will and Kenny and Alex.
[01:30:51.605 --> 01:30:54.487]  We'll at least get to those calls in this hour.
[01:30:55.828 --> 01:31:00.962]  Then Gerald Cilente, always informative, hard-hitting, will be in the fourth hour in the War Room.
[01:31:01.383 --> 01:31:02.506]  Owen Schroer, then...
[01:31:03.464 --> 01:31:09.209]  Firepower's 7 o'clock central with Will Johnson and Tom Papert and others kicking butt.
[01:31:09.949 --> 01:31:11.590]  And again, David Knight, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[01:31:11.610 --> 01:31:13.172]  You can find it all at band.video.
[01:31:13.572 --> 01:31:16.034]  The site is exponentially, logarithmically growing.
[01:31:16.454 --> 01:31:17.755]  Thanks to you, word of mouth.
[01:31:18.015 --> 01:31:23.580]  Tell folks, hey, you want to hear what you're not supposed to hear about the real war going on, why all the censorship's happening, what they don't want you to hear?
[01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:25.361]  Band.video.
[01:31:25.381 --> 01:31:26.162]  So thank you for that.
[01:31:26.202 --> 01:31:28.443]  And also support the local stations in your area.
[01:31:29.332 --> 01:31:31.513]  TV, radio, please tell folks about those.
[01:31:31.954 --> 01:31:33.054]  Mike Adams is an engineer.
[01:31:33.474 --> 01:31:40.318]  He also owns one of the largest testing facilities in Texas, and one of the largest in the U.S.
[01:31:40.338 --> 01:31:41.199]  does a great job there.
[01:31:41.219 --> 01:31:42.600]  Does a lot of scientific work.
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:43.620]  He owns Natural News.
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:49.284]  He's a filmmaker, documentary filmmaker, and also author, and publishes multinational.
[01:31:49.764 --> 01:31:53.326]  And he's an expert on a lot of the things happening with genetic engineering and more.
[01:31:53.646 --> 01:31:58.229]  But the reason he joins us now, the reason he joins us today,
[01:31:59.659 --> 01:32:03.500]  is to get into that big article that he published yesterday at NaturalNews.com.
[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:04.301]  U.S.
[01:32:04.521 --> 01:32:14.064]  Marine Reserve units activated for emergency within the United States, quote, quote, continuing, which will, in quotes, come with little warning, quote, threats in the homeland.
[01:32:14.884 --> 01:32:16.826]  We are not calling for an in-deposit comment on us.
[01:32:17.147 --> 01:32:19.749]  That's not troops on the street policing people in the civil authority.
[01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:26.517]  The president of an outside rogue group, outside of the legislature, outside of law, tries to remove him.
[01:32:26.637 --> 01:32:31.963]  As they're now saying, they said on the Aspen Institute, on CNN, we're going to remove him outside of impeachment.
[01:32:32.323 --> 01:32:34.305]  And Blitzer says, how are you going to do that?
[01:32:34.325 --> 01:32:35.406]  And they said, just watch.
[01:32:36.624 --> 01:32:37.684]  So that's illegal.
[01:32:37.744 --> 01:32:38.545]  That's dangerous.
[01:32:39.205 --> 01:32:40.625]  We need to have a debate about this.
[01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:43.006]  What happens if they remove Trump?
[01:32:43.506 --> 01:32:46.687]  In fact, one of the callers says here, what happens after Trump is removed?
[01:32:46.707 --> 01:32:48.268]  Well, we'll go to that call first.
[01:32:48.308 --> 01:32:51.129]  But Mike Adams, break down here how huge this is.
[01:32:51.209 --> 01:32:53.789]  And we've never seen a Marine Corps order like this.
[01:32:53.849 --> 01:32:55.330]  It happened four days ago.
[01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:56.850]  You're linking your article to the order.
[01:32:57.210 --> 01:32:58.031]  This is not a joke.
[01:32:58.091 --> 01:32:58.671]  It's not a drill.
[01:32:58.691 --> 01:33:00.131]  And the president says we're in a civil war.
[01:33:00.371 --> 01:33:01.772]  He says there is an active coup.
[01:33:02.392 --> 01:33:05.594]  This is, we told people this a couple years ago, but now it's the president.
[01:33:05.614 --> 01:33:08.696]  People say, even the Austin American Statesman was in the print edition.
[01:33:08.736 --> 01:33:10.657]  I saw it and people were telling me about it.
[01:33:10.917 --> 01:33:13.798]  Oh, suddenly the whole country's Alex Jones and Infowars.
[01:33:14.199 --> 01:33:21.263]  Talk of martial law, talk of civil war, talk of coups by everybody.
[01:33:22.283 --> 01:33:24.184]  Well, that's because we're just covering reality.
[01:33:24.224 --> 01:33:25.905]  It was already going on, now it's out in the open.
[01:33:25.945 --> 01:33:28.707]  What would you call this critical time and how huge this is, Mike Adams?
[01:33:29.448 --> 01:33:40.014]  Well, it's important to understand that this order talks about these troops, the Marine Corps Reserve Units, ISO civil authorities, means in support of civil authorities.
[01:33:40.414 --> 01:33:44.917]  So you're absolutely correct when you say this is not an attempt to bypass Posse Comitatus.
[01:33:45.257 --> 01:33:56.944]  This is using Reserve Marine Corps forces to support civil authorities who will be engaged in a lawful pursuit to shut down those who are engaged in breaking the law.
[01:33:57.524 --> 01:34:07.976]  So, that's step one of this, but I've reached out to my contacts in the military, active military, as well as some retired military, and they've told me a couple of interesting things.
[01:34:08.337 --> 01:34:11.420]  Number one, they say that normally these orders have a 120-day window of being active.
[01:34:15.024 --> 01:34:23.488]  So, if that's true, then what that means is Trump is expecting a hard coup, a kinetic coup within the next 120 days.
[01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:29.771]  And that timeline actually lines up with what we're seeing with the mass hysteria in the media, the calls for killing.
[01:34:30.591 --> 01:34:35.432]  Trump or impeaching Trump or shiving Rudy Giuliani and so on.
[01:34:35.472 --> 01:34:41.453]  So there's an amping up that seems to be pointing to a desperate timeline on the part of the Dems.
[01:34:41.834 --> 01:34:54.676]  We also know that the documents from the IG investigation and the DOJ, AG William Barr and so on, are expected to be released in the next perhaps two, maybe three, maybe four weeks as an outlier.
[01:34:55.136 --> 01:34:56.557]  But within that 120-day window,
[01:34:58.132 --> 01:35:07.074]  And it's widely believed by those of us who are in the know here, and I know you believe this as well, that the Dems, the Democrats know many of them are going to go to jail.
[01:35:07.594 --> 01:35:08.415]  They will be indicted.
[01:35:08.515 --> 01:35:09.655]  They will be criminally charged.
[01:35:10.075 --> 01:35:20.978]  Many of them will spend the rest of their lives in prison when the truth comes out about their FISA warrant, court abuse, their collusion, their obstruction of justice, their witness tampering, all the things that they did.
[01:35:21.710 --> 01:35:27.174]  But there's one more scenario here that I'll share with you, Alex, that just came to light when I was talking to my contacts.
[01:35:27.634 --> 01:35:29.575]  And that is that with the U.S.
[01:35:29.595 --> 01:35:46.206]  Marine Corps forces activated, Trump could flip this to invoking the Insurrection Act and then reach out and arrest, through military police, the traitors, the treasonous actors in the United States who are attempting to carry out a coup.
[01:35:46.467 --> 01:35:49.709]  So it might be that the President is hoping that they will try this.
[01:35:50.530 --> 01:36:03.006]  So that the President can then invoke the Insurrection Act and send out the Marines to literally hunt down, arrest, and detain these treasonous criminals to face military tribunals.
[01:36:03.086 --> 01:36:07.271]  So those are the scenarios that are now being assessed by people who are in the know.
[01:36:07.992 --> 01:36:08.713]  Well, let's be clear.
[01:36:08.853 --> 01:36:15.639]  If the president knows there's people in the executive branch who are not following orders and will try to organize a coup against him, that's normally how it works.
[01:36:16.039 --> 01:36:25.308]  Traders inside the executive working with other groups in the legislature and then with financiers behind it, then the president needs to go after them.
[01:36:25.328 --> 01:36:32.775]  That's what happens in seven days in May with, you know, famous Hollywood actors, Burt Lancaster and others.
[01:36:33.335 --> 01:36:39.905]  It's a simulated situation and they end up having to use the Marines to basically stop the other military from taking over.
[01:36:39.925 --> 01:36:40.846]  I'm going from memory on that.
[01:36:41.086 --> 01:36:43.490]  Guys, queue up the trailer for 7 Days in May.
[01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:47.816]  It came out in the 1960s because there was actually talk about this going on back then.
[01:36:47.856 --> 01:36:49.959]  This happens in third world countries all the time and I want to be clear.
[01:36:51.092 --> 01:36:51.693]  We don't want
[01:37:13.336 --> 01:37:13.496]  I don't
[01:37:41.616 --> 01:37:46.103]  Trump confidant who had dinner with him at Mar-a-Lago right when he was gotten into office.
[01:37:47.124 --> 01:37:48.727]  I guess it was probably the first trip to Mar-a-Lago.
[01:37:49.682 --> 01:37:55.804]  And this individual, I'm not going to get into all the details, and I wasn't told never tell this story, but I never really told this story.
[01:37:55.824 --> 01:37:57.225]  I just mentioned I'd heard this from others.
[01:37:57.725 --> 01:38:00.966]  Then I did ask around about this, but Trump is very fatalistic.
[01:38:00.986 --> 01:38:02.646]  He said, I always wanted to get elected.
[01:38:02.666 --> 01:38:03.747]  I always thought I could get elected.
[01:38:04.247 --> 01:38:05.767]  I didn't want to have to do this unless I had to.
[01:38:06.308 --> 01:38:09.569]  But if they try to take me out by impeachment or whatever, I'll go through it.
[01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:11.449]  I'll, you know, let them have the trial.
[01:38:11.729 --> 01:38:13.110]  They remove me, then that's what happens.
[01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:18.586]  He goes, I'm putting everything on this, my name, everything, because, you know, these people just can't be allowed to run this beautiful country in the ground.
[01:38:18.967 --> 01:38:20.592]  But he said, if they try a coup...
[01:38:22.616 --> 01:38:28.718]  And if they try to remove me outside of law, I'm going to call out the Marines and surround the White House, and then we're going to arrest their asses.
[01:38:29.119 --> 01:38:32.260]  So he's very fatalistic, and I was told, very fatalistic.
[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:34.420]  And by fatalistic, he doesn't want to die or fail.
[01:38:34.741 --> 01:38:38.902]  He's peddled the metal, beyond confident, committed that he's going to follow this course.
[01:38:38.942 --> 01:38:40.883]  So I think it's good news to put that out.
[01:38:41.083 --> 01:38:42.683]  The President's not going to resign, folks.
[01:38:43.184 --> 01:38:45.524]  He's not going to resign so Hillary can slide in and get into office.
[01:38:45.765 --> 01:38:46.325]  Not going to happen.
[01:38:46.345 --> 01:38:46.905]  Don't hold your breath.
[01:38:48.630 --> 01:39:00.837]  And Alex, watch for simultaneous activation of the terror cells that were brought into this country, relocated under the Obama administration, actually shipped to the cities to await orders, and they were brought in with the illegal migrant caravans.
[01:39:00.877 --> 01:39:02.698]  So there are terror cells ready to be activated.
[01:39:02.718 --> 01:39:03.598]  And by the way, that's confirmed.
[01:39:03.618 --> 01:39:05.119]  You'll have the floor when we come back, Mike Adams.
[01:39:05.139 --> 01:39:05.820]  I forgot about that.
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:06.480]  That's so critical.
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:11.323]  Also, they have the Hezbollah cells, the MS-13, all God's children that Pelosi talks about.
[01:39:11.563 --> 01:39:12.423]  This isn't a game.
[01:39:12.463 --> 01:39:13.204]  This isn't a joke.
[01:39:13.504 --> 01:39:15.425]  This is The Globalist making their move on America.
[01:39:16.225 --> 01:39:16.606]  Stay with us.
[01:39:16.626 --> 01:39:17.146]  We'll be right back.
[01:39:19.181 --> 01:39:20.421]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[01:39:20.461 --> 01:39:22.902]  I promise we're going to your phone calls for everybody holding next segment.
[01:39:23.322 --> 01:39:24.683]  Mike Adams riding shotgun with us.
[01:39:25.283 --> 01:39:27.544]  Researcher, engineer, naturalnews.com.
[01:39:27.564 --> 01:39:30.345]  I'm Alex Jones with newsworks.com and Vandod Video.
[01:39:30.445 --> 01:39:30.705]  Okay.
[01:39:31.725 --> 01:39:41.248]  Again, to explain how this coup works, these private multinationals that have taken control of the national security apparatus have openly
[01:39:42.881 --> 01:39:45.462]  Try to intimidate everybody in the media, everybody in government.
[01:39:45.822 --> 01:39:48.423]  Tell them that when Trump gets taken out, you're going to get it too.
[01:39:49.103 --> 01:39:53.284]  So that's why so many people pay lip service against Trump, because they're scared.
[01:39:53.304 --> 01:39:58.106]  Just like the polls show, people won't tell people they're for Trump, but when they actually vote, they vote for Trump.
[01:39:58.586 --> 01:40:00.527]  It's the same thing, it's that little secret.
[01:40:01.348 --> 01:40:03.209]  Well, it's important to not be secret about it.
[01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:09.111]  It's important to be out in the open about it and realize the score, what we're facing here.
[01:40:09.991 --> 01:40:12.852]  There are a lot of powerful evil forces arrayed against America.
[01:40:13.553 --> 01:40:19.155]  But if we ever expose those forces and if people realize who those forces are, folks are going to choose the right way.
[01:40:20.114 --> 01:40:21.995]  Prosperity, justice, freedom, it's all waiting.
[01:40:22.896 --> 01:40:39.208]  And so let's talk about, if they go kinetic, and how they're preparing to go kinetic, they're testing their perch, they're testing the water right now, the level not seen in the last three years, not seen since this began, and why you think the time is so critical, and why Trump's activated the Marines, in case they try to take them out.
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:53.186]  Well, it's critical to understand that once they pull the trigger on this kinetic coup or hard coup against Trump, as we're calling it, this will be accompanied by many other plans that have been put in place since Barack Obama.
[01:40:53.206 --> 01:40:57.988]  You know, the Obama administration installed terror cells all across America.
[01:40:58.448 --> 01:41:01.610]  He funded the whole Arab Spring and destabilized all of that.
[01:41:01.630 --> 01:41:02.210]  He means business.
[01:41:17.765 --> 01:41:22.226]  And his plans are still in place, and he is still their commander-in-chief.
[01:41:22.286 --> 01:41:25.927]  So, there are terror cells waiting for an order from Obama.
[01:41:26.487 --> 01:41:34.389]  And when the coup goes down, you are, I predict, you're going to see attempts to sabotage the power grid by these terror cells.
[01:41:34.809 --> 01:41:37.770]  So, there are going to be local grid-down situations.
[01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:42.931]  You're going to see attempts to sabotage military bases, especially in places like California.
[01:41:43.692 --> 01:41:45.392]  And those bases could be hit with
[01:41:46.050 --> 01:41:51.331]  All kinds of things, including small-scale EMP weapons as well.
[01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:55.012]  You're going to see chaos across America, and they want this chaos.
[01:41:55.292 --> 01:41:56.693]  They want to cause a market crash.
[01:41:57.113 --> 01:42:03.894]  No matter what happens to the impeachment outcome, the Democrats in the deep state know if they can crash the market, then they can roll out a whole new narrative.
[01:42:04.094 --> 01:42:08.495]  Oh, well, Trump survived impeachment, but look, the economy has gone to pot.
[01:42:08.515 --> 01:42:10.356]  Let's be clear, the biggest movie in years.
[01:42:10.836 --> 01:42:13.137]  Joker is openly about Antifa.
[01:42:13.157 --> 01:42:15.038]  Paul Watson went to it, felt physically ill.
[01:42:15.518 --> 01:42:17.699]  The darkness left with him for days.
[01:42:19.299 --> 01:42:22.721]  Antifa, rise up, murder police, burn buildings, kill everybody.
[01:42:22.761 --> 01:42:24.141]  It's beautiful to be a psychotic.
[01:42:24.442 --> 01:42:25.762]  It's meant to cause mass shootings.
[01:42:25.802 --> 01:42:27.503]  I mean, they're really trying to do this.
[01:42:28.373 --> 01:42:34.817]  Well, and don't forget that in California now, and Breitbart is in a big war with, I think, the Los Angeles Police Department right now.
[01:42:35.137 --> 01:42:40.140]  In Los Angeles, they will not hire conservatives to be police officers, but they will hire gang members.
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:44.262]  So you're actually seeing an MS-13 infiltration of law enforcement.
[01:42:44.782 --> 01:42:56.695]  In Los Angeles and perhaps other cities across California, this is consistent with what Obama did to bring terrorists into America and have them infiltrate, in fact, law enforcement, and California itself, run by terrorists.
[01:42:56.715 --> 01:42:58.877]  Oh, New Mexico's hiring illegal aliens to be police.
[01:42:59.838 --> 01:43:01.540]  Oh yeah, right.
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.062]  So, this is happening across the board.
[01:43:03.342 --> 01:43:06.686]  They're waiting for an activation signal.
[01:43:07.330 --> 01:43:11.352]  And that activation signal will coincide with a hard coup attempt.
[01:43:11.692 --> 01:43:19.536]  And of course, CNN will stage this, or they will be there to film this being staged, exactly as they staged the raid on Roger Stone.
[01:43:20.037 --> 01:43:23.719]  CNN was tipped off so that they could make Roger Stone look guilty on camera.
[01:43:23.959 --> 01:43:31.603]  Or during the Arab Spring, the CNN reporters, they're saying how wonderful it was that freedom was taking over when they were murdering and killing Christians and others en masse.
[01:43:33.155 --> 01:43:33.795]  Exactly right.
[01:43:34.015 --> 01:43:38.697]  But of course, CNN and the Democrats, they vastly underestimate the will of the people.
[01:43:39.037 --> 01:43:50.040]  So we're talking about bikers for Trump, truckers for Trump, even union workers for Trump, former law enforcement, former military, veterans for Trump, just armed citizens for Trump, for America.
[01:43:50.380 --> 01:43:55.482]  It's a massive contingent of people who are just not going to stand by and let their country be steamrolled.
[01:43:56.302 --> 01:43:58.704]  And watch Hillary Clinton be installed as a president.
[01:43:59.064 --> 01:44:00.285]  You know this scenario, Alex.
[01:44:00.725 --> 01:44:03.927]  If they get rid of Trump and Pence, Nancy Pelosi becomes president.
[01:44:04.208 --> 01:44:09.171]  Nancy Pelosi appoints Hillary as the vice president, and then Pelosi resigns, making Hillary the president.
[01:44:09.531 --> 01:44:13.154]  Their plan is to install Hillary Clinton as president by the end of this year.
[01:44:13.991 --> 01:44:14.632]  That's their plan.
[01:44:14.732 --> 01:44:16.313]  And let's explain why she wouldn't run.
[01:44:16.333 --> 01:44:17.994]  That way all the corruption isn't brought up.
[01:44:18.034 --> 01:44:19.916]  That way all the other candidates chew themselves up.
[01:44:19.956 --> 01:44:21.117]  That way an impeachment begins.
[01:44:21.437 --> 01:44:24.519]  Trump's quote in trouble and then in slides Hillary Clinton.
[01:44:24.799 --> 01:44:25.840]  She's been collecting the money.
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:28.162]  She's been telling her underlings she's still gonna run.
[01:44:28.442 --> 01:44:31.725]  This is a fact and now it's all over the news that she does intend to run.
[01:44:33.211 --> 01:44:40.977]  And if they succeed in this plan, by the way, and I think they will fail, but in their minds they think they will succeed, then she doesn't have to campaign.
[01:44:41.397 --> 01:44:43.799]  She will be installed as president.
[01:44:44.219 --> 01:44:45.340]  That's what they hope to do.
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:47.501]  They don't even need her to go to any debates.
[01:44:47.841 --> 01:44:55.307]  They're going to install an authoritarian dictatorship, or at least they think they will, and from that point on, it's mass executions of all Trump supporters.
[01:44:55.567 --> 01:45:00.030]  You know, you and me and all of us will be on the hit list, the death squad list,
[01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:08.877]  That's exactly what will happen because there's zero tolerance in the minds of leftists for the existence of Christians, conservatives, or Trump supporters, or gun owners for that matter.
[01:45:09.057 --> 01:45:11.759]  It's going to be nationwide gun confiscation, mass death squads.
[01:45:11.779 --> 01:45:15.883]  They're going to take down any opposition to Democrats and they're going to try to rule.
[01:45:16.263 --> 01:45:17.184]  This is their plan again.
[01:45:17.204 --> 01:45:24.090]  I think they will fail, but their plan is to rule America forevermore as basically communist China rules over China.
[01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:25.010]  That's their plan.
[01:45:25.331 --> 01:45:28.153]  China is the model for the way the Democrats want to rule America.
[01:45:28.815 --> 01:45:31.097]  So what's stopping them, of course, is the Second Amendment.
[01:45:31.417 --> 01:45:34.259]  You know, veterans, patriotism, common sense.
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:40.544]  But that's why when they then carry out the attack, if anybody resists, they're going to go, oh, it's the white nationalists resisting.
[01:45:40.905 --> 01:45:43.107]  Everybody who's brown, shoot the white nationalists.
[01:45:43.127 --> 01:45:45.809]  You can see the whole admitted preparation for this.
[01:45:46.650 --> 01:45:53.673]  Yep, yep, and this is why you've seen Deep State Elements declare white nationalism as being terrorism recently.
[01:45:53.713 --> 01:45:57.055]  They're setting the stage for the narrative that you just described.
[01:45:57.335 --> 01:46:10.401]  And they've acknowledged groups like UT and every other university that control Antifa, they're just the decoys, ready with hit lists, ready with their quote A-teams, and of course they're pathetic, but they're just the front people for real hit teams that are going to be coming.
[01:46:10.782 --> 01:46:11.902]  We're not trying to scare folks.
[01:46:11.962 --> 01:46:13.483]  This is the globalist attempt at takedown.
[01:46:13.903 --> 01:46:19.105]  A country couldn't be taken down as powerful of us from without, but it can be done from within.
[01:46:19.125 --> 01:46:20.586]  We're going to go to break soon.
[01:46:20.626 --> 01:46:21.726]  We'll go to calls when we come back.
[01:46:21.746 --> 01:46:27.809]  I'm going to play an MSNBC clip where they say, oh, we're going to remove Trump, put Pelosi in.
[01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:32.711]  Then we have a quote, a former Trump executive saying, oh, I think he'll resign.
[01:46:33.011 --> 01:46:34.552]  They're putting all this out there.
[01:46:35.032 --> 01:46:39.214]  Mike, how do we reach out to the president and others and Congress and say, hey, hold the line.
[01:46:39.554 --> 01:46:40.954]  Don't back down to the intimidation.
[01:46:42.656 --> 01:46:46.352]  That we've got to understand that if we give in to this, it means red terror.
[01:46:47.267 --> 01:46:49.069]  Well, we do exactly what we're doing right now.
[01:46:49.429 --> 01:46:53.733]  You stay alive, you stay on the air, you stay successful, you keep growing your network as you're doing.
[01:46:53.793 --> 01:46:59.818]  It's extraordinary that in the face of all these attacks and all these attempts to shut you down, you continue to grow and gain support.
[01:47:00.138 --> 01:47:04.762]  And you know, that caller earlier that was saying that you're bad because you're still alive, that's absurd.
[01:47:05.042 --> 01:47:08.946]  You're fighting like crazy to stay alive and stay on the air, and I am too.
[01:47:09.286 --> 01:47:14.771]  And just the fact that we are still here is a miracle that probably means God is literally protecting us
[01:47:15.151 --> 01:47:18.015]  Because this is an important mission for all of humanity.
[01:47:18.376 --> 01:47:21.801]  You know, like, you're only innocent if you're dead?
[01:47:22.201 --> 01:47:23.223]  That doesn't make any sense.
[01:47:23.283 --> 01:47:31.475]  No, we're alive, we're fighting, we're fighting for America, and more people are joining us in this effort because we will not be steamrolled by these demonic terrorists.
[01:47:32.115 --> 01:47:35.438]  It's like when some bully starts a fight with you, and you kick his ass, and you go, wow, I did that.
[01:47:36.018 --> 01:47:37.759]  Folks gotta believe we can really change the world.
[01:47:37.779 --> 01:47:38.980]  Of course, Infowars is real.
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:41.382]  But that was just a leftist calling in to put in doubt.
[01:47:41.442 --> 01:47:42.483]  He wasn't being legitimate.
[01:47:42.823 --> 01:47:45.084]  The truth is, is that there's not just evil in the world, there's good.
[01:47:45.445 --> 01:47:47.526]  And it's our amazing listeners that keep us on the air.
[01:47:47.766 --> 01:47:49.608]  We'll be right back with your calls and so much more.
[01:47:49.868 --> 01:47:50.848]  Key Intel, straight ahead.
[01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:53.951]  And who are the clowns?
[01:47:55.672 --> 01:47:58.534]  They're all the disheveled drug addict leftists.
[01:47:59.608 --> 01:48:06.789]  We're told they were supposed to be the ruling class by the left that sold them worthless college degrees and taught them there was no God and that family wasn't good.
[01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:10.930]  But now they go out and kill some rich people, kill some white people.
[01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:17.931]  If they hate America, if they engage in mass shootings, they'll be movie stars, they'll be good guys, they'll be heroes.
[01:48:18.611 --> 01:48:20.212]  Really all you'll do is burn down your neighborhood.
[01:48:20.512 --> 01:48:27.073]  And it's the ultra-rich that sold America out who are actually funding a class warfare system.
[01:48:27.093 --> 01:48:28.133]  And America's not buying it.
[01:48:29.087 --> 01:48:33.549]  So they produce more movies, they make more Netflix shows, they make more jokers to do it all.
[01:48:33.569 --> 01:48:34.589]  But you know what happened on the way?
[01:48:35.229 --> 01:48:39.691]  Epoch Times, I remember reading it in the early 2000s, Falun Gong got involved, set it up.
[01:48:40.031 --> 01:48:42.132]  They were being killed, having their organs taken in China.
[01:48:42.813 --> 01:48:46.314]  So some Chinese-Americans got together and they set up the Epoch Times.
[01:48:47.114 --> 01:48:49.295]  And then just six, seven years ago, they decided to do multimedia.
[01:48:49.635 --> 01:48:53.377]  You know, they're in the top 10 media worldwide for videos.
[01:48:54.257 --> 01:48:55.578]  Billions and billions of views a year.
[01:48:56.775 --> 01:49:00.077]  And to get rid of them for worse, well now the State Department with the left is still in it.
[01:49:00.837 --> 01:49:04.038]  And NBC and CNN want the Epoch Times taken off the air.
[01:49:05.199 --> 01:49:06.880]  Why, they're supporting the people in Hong Kong.
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:07.540]  You can't have that.
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:08.280]  Look at the rockets.
[01:49:08.961 --> 01:49:11.562]  Why, Communist China said, you apologize for criticizing us.
[01:49:11.862 --> 01:49:13.363]  We're saying Hong Kong deserves freedom.
[01:49:13.743 --> 01:49:14.583]  And they said, you're right.
[01:49:14.623 --> 01:49:15.564]  We'll do what you say.
[01:49:16.304 --> 01:49:17.825]  Send in the clowns.
[01:49:21.066 --> 01:49:24.708]  But Epoch Times put all this together about a year ago.
[01:49:26.383 --> 01:49:37.333]  And it shows the whole Spygate, Brennan, Clapper, Hillary, how they set it up, how Obama did it, all the fake spies, all the fake info, how it's all a giant fraud with the media, the insurance policy.
[01:49:38.794 --> 01:49:39.515]  Yeah, zoom in on that.
[01:49:39.995 --> 01:49:40.756]  It's all right there.
[01:49:40.796 --> 01:49:42.197]  That's free, by the way, on their website.
[01:49:42.798 --> 01:49:43.919]  They're not paying me to promote this.
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:46.781]  It's good to see real journalism.
[01:49:46.801 --> 01:49:50.124]  You know, they reverse engineered it all, just like we did, but they made a nice graph out of it.
[01:49:50.644 --> 01:49:51.665]  You can find that online.
[01:49:52.526 --> 01:49:53.187]  The Epoch Times.
[01:49:54.775 --> 01:49:59.679]  Investigation into the insurance policy, the one into Spygate and the dossier networks.
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:01.900]  It's got them all right there.
[01:50:03.161 --> 01:50:05.763]  How they carried it out, how they did it.
[01:50:05.783 --> 01:50:16.631]  Now these same networks got a book out called Information War put out by the CIA talking about how, well, they've lost the war against the American people, but they can censor and take it back.
[01:50:16.651 --> 01:50:17.392]  They actually say that.
[01:50:17.852 --> 01:50:21.295]  You know, they are losing the war and they're going to lose no matter what they do because you're scum.
[01:50:22.278 --> 01:50:23.339]  You're trying to say we're the traitors?
[01:50:23.359 --> 01:50:24.100]  We're the outsiders?
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:25.601]  We're the people that hate America?
[01:50:25.661 --> 01:50:26.782]  No, it's you and everybody knows it.
[01:50:27.062 --> 01:50:28.783]  You can't even shut your fat mouths.
[01:50:29.904 --> 01:50:35.329]  In between foaming at the mouth wanting to kill already born babies and promoting pedophilia and devil worship and everything else you're into.
[01:50:35.349 --> 01:50:36.910]  It's your diseased psychotics.
[01:50:38.491 --> 01:50:38.852]  Now you.
[01:50:40.267 --> 01:50:41.448]  Tell us your killer babies after they're born.
[01:50:41.468 --> 01:50:41.888]  It's incredible.
[01:50:41.908 --> 01:50:43.369]  Mike Adams is here with us.
[01:50:43.429 --> 01:50:44.469]  I want to play this clip.
[01:50:44.829 --> 01:50:46.930]  Get his take and then take calls on Joy Reid.
[01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:49.772]  I'm not going to play Trump's quote former executive.
[01:50:49.792 --> 01:50:50.752]  She ran one of his buildings.
[01:50:51.213 --> 01:50:53.174]  Going, I think he'll step down.
[01:50:53.794 --> 01:50:54.994]  He's not for real.
[01:50:55.035 --> 01:50:57.356]  If you just go after him, he'll resign.
[01:50:57.656 --> 01:50:59.357]  If you just start the impeachment.
[01:51:00.137 --> 01:51:01.598]  So that's all what they're putting out.
[01:51:01.838 --> 01:51:05.300]  We'll put Pelosi or Hillary at all.
[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.481]  They'll fix it for us.
[01:51:08.817 --> 01:51:12.438]  Here's Joy Reid having a fantasy event with her panel.
[01:51:13.939 --> 01:51:23.522]  How does anything change if Donald Trump is no longer at the top of this sort of, you know, web of corruption, but Pence is then at the top?
[01:51:23.542 --> 01:51:24.242]  I'm sorry, start it over.
[01:51:24.262 --> 01:51:25.202]  Start it over from the beginning.
[01:51:25.583 --> 01:51:27.323]  This web of corruption.
[01:51:28.824 --> 01:51:30.224]  He's surrounded by cowards.
[01:51:31.364 --> 01:51:32.325]  The web is you.
[01:51:33.385 --> 01:51:35.286]  Perfect psychological projection.
[01:51:35.306 --> 01:51:35.946]  Sorry, start it over.
[01:51:37.850 --> 01:51:44.832]  How does anything change if Donald Trump is no longer at the top of this sort of, you know, web of corruption?
[01:51:45.113 --> 01:51:45.753]  Sorry, start it over.
[01:51:45.773 --> 01:51:46.353]  Start it over.
[01:51:46.373 --> 01:51:47.413]  I gotta say this.
[01:51:47.433 --> 01:51:49.654]  I'm serious.
[01:51:49.774 --> 01:51:51.975]  Now they say we've gotta get everyone below it.
[01:51:52.135 --> 01:51:55.096]  All the nationalists, all the patriots, the folks you couldn't intimidate.
[01:51:55.796 --> 01:51:55.996]  See?
[01:51:56.016 --> 01:51:58.057]  Of course you were always coming after our guys.
[01:51:58.077 --> 01:51:59.297]  You were always coming after our kids.
[01:52:00.698 --> 01:52:04.439]  You're a bunch of knuckle-draggers, but you don't like civilization.
[01:52:04.639 --> 01:52:05.520]  You didn't build the country.
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:06.500]  You're globalist.
[01:52:07.742 --> 01:52:09.044]  And so now, you're coming after us.
[01:52:09.064 --> 01:52:09.405]  Here it is.
[01:52:10.727 --> 01:52:20.625]  How does anything change if Donald Trump is no longer at the top of this sort of, you know, web of corruption, but Pence is then at the top of it?
[01:52:21.004 --> 01:52:22.565]  Well, I think a couple things happen.
[01:52:22.845 --> 01:52:37.636]  One, the American voters will actually see, and I remain sort of a Pollyanna that I believe facts ultimately matter, and that in fact even 20 Republican senators might come to their senses and say,
[01:52:38.416 --> 01:52:41.318]  The country is at risk if I don't vote this way.
[01:52:41.738 --> 01:52:43.179]  And the facts are clear.
[01:52:43.499 --> 01:52:46.220]  And I think in this case we have very clear facts.
[01:52:46.701 --> 01:52:52.664]  There is, and Liz and I talked about this before the show, you could impeach Pence first.
[01:52:53.084 --> 01:52:56.706]  The problem is that Donald Trump then has to name his replacement.
[01:52:57.106 --> 01:53:01.489]  But I think that maybe a deal could be struck where he was told if you don't
[01:53:02.446 --> 01:53:03.867]  The proper party remains in power.
[01:53:03.887 --> 01:53:04.447]  That's a total coup.
[01:53:04.467 --> 01:53:06.369]  By threatening people, we could make a deal where it's
[01:53:26.883 --> 01:53:30.804]  Nancy Pelosi is obviously on a bunch of amphetamines and can barely talk.
[01:53:31.384 --> 01:53:36.066]  Mike Adams, I want to go to these calls, I've been holding patiently, but these people are power mad.
[01:53:36.086 --> 01:53:38.407]  They're like pretending to be soldiers.
[01:53:39.087 --> 01:53:41.948]  They're like pretending to be rulers, but really it's just a bunch of...
[01:53:42.668 --> 01:53:50.395]  You know, fat old women on drugs, most of them, you can tell, up there about how they're going to dominate us and rule everyone and overthrow elections.
[01:53:51.375 --> 01:53:53.297]  I mean, this is their plan.
[01:53:53.317 --> 01:53:55.619]  They're telling us, wow, talk about dangerous.
[01:53:55.639 --> 01:54:00.743]  I mean, I guess we deserve to be conquered by this if we roll over to it and are CHICOM handlers.
[01:54:00.763 --> 01:54:02.345]  What do you want to say to this skeksi?
[01:54:03.288 --> 01:54:10.372]  Well, they're admitting their plan that we've described, which is to install Hillary Clinton as president by first making Nancy Pelosi president.
[01:54:10.492 --> 01:54:12.694]  And, you know, you watch these women.
[01:54:13.214 --> 01:54:13.934]  They are delusional.
[01:54:13.954 --> 01:54:16.596]  They're living in a bubble world and they're gaslighting each other.
[01:54:17.036 --> 01:54:22.460]  That's, you know, if facts matter, as she said, if facts matter, the Democrats are done for forever.
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:28.223]  If facts matter, the deep state is over because it will be drained if facts matter.
[01:54:28.243 --> 01:54:29.564]  You know, the facts are on our side.
[01:54:30.164 --> 01:54:31.385]  The nation is on our side.
[01:54:31.605 --> 01:54:32.806]  We are on the side of America.
[01:54:33.446 --> 01:54:39.152]  All of those people that you just saw, they are opposed to every principle of this nation.
[01:54:39.512 --> 01:54:43.956]  And many of them are deliberately functioning as enemies of the people of America.
[01:54:44.537 --> 01:54:48.401]  And they will probably face a day of reckoning for that, I would imagine.
[01:54:49.302 --> 01:54:49.982]  So, that's my take on this.
[01:54:50.002 --> 01:54:50.683]  I totally agree.
[01:54:50.703 --> 01:54:53.246]  And the fact that they're in their own little bubbles.
[01:54:53.926 --> 01:54:59.271]  And nothing against people that live in city areas, but you go downtown Austin or downtown Manhattan or whatever, especially younger.
[01:54:59.291 --> 01:55:00.453]  I mean, they're like bubbled people.
[01:55:00.473 --> 01:55:02.094]  They don't know how to fix a tire.
[01:55:02.134 --> 01:55:06.058]  They don't even know how the world works, but they all just live in their own BS.
[01:55:06.458 --> 01:55:09.541]  And these globalists walk around amongst all these zombies and feel powerful.
[01:55:09.601 --> 01:55:09.782]  Look!
[01:55:10.242 --> 01:55:12.043]  You know, humans are finished.
[01:55:12.443 --> 01:55:13.364]  No, we're not finished.
[01:55:13.444 --> 01:55:14.384]  America's not done.
[01:55:14.464 --> 01:55:22.049]  And the globalists had a chance if they kind of ignored Trump, tried to co-opt him, told him what he wanted to hear, went along with him for a lot of it, they could have waited it out.
[01:55:22.309 --> 01:55:26.511]  The fact that they're having a big war with us right up front, I think derails them forever.
[01:55:26.571 --> 01:55:32.975]  I mean, it's going to be rough on you and I and the listeners and everybody, but you know, I think in the end the way they're acting is going to make it a lot worse.
[01:55:33.595 --> 01:55:34.896]  What happens if they kill Trump?
[01:55:34.916 --> 01:55:36.357]  Doesn't that make it worse if they kill Trump too?
[01:55:36.937 --> 01:55:38.839]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:55:38.879 --> 01:55:43.384]  Then it becomes activation of patriots all across America instantly.
[01:55:43.704 --> 01:55:45.987]  That's why they will be very reluctant to try to do that.
[01:55:46.007 --> 01:55:49.751]  They want to get Trump through a process that pretends to be legal.
[01:55:50.091 --> 01:55:53.134]  Remember, there has been no vote for impeachment proceedings.
[01:55:53.415 --> 01:55:55.637]  There are no real subpoenas being issued by Congress.
[01:55:55.677 --> 01:55:56.238]  It's all fake.
[01:55:56.278 --> 01:55:56.858]  It's gaslighting.
[01:55:56.878 --> 01:55:57.319]  It's theater.
[01:55:57.659 --> 01:55:58.981]  Everything the left does is theater.
[01:55:59.381 --> 01:56:00.943]  And so they're just rolling out the same thing again.
[01:56:00.963 --> 01:56:02.406]  You made that point to me on the phone the other day.
[01:56:02.426 --> 01:56:05.830]  I mean, it's just like all the fake Me Too and all the fake stuff with Kavanaugh.
[01:56:05.850 --> 01:56:08.154]  And then they just admit the first guy wasn't even real.
[01:56:08.454 --> 01:56:10.357]  Now this second one, oh, that's not real.
[01:56:10.397 --> 01:56:11.258]  It's all just crap.
[01:56:11.418 --> 01:56:13.061]  Because it can never stand up to scrutiny.
[01:56:13.081 --> 01:56:13.682]  It's just made up.
[01:56:15.024 --> 01:56:23.089]  Remember, one thing I said to you privately, which I'll share here, is that there will be an infinite number of whistleblowers just like there are an infinite number of genders.
[01:56:23.429 --> 01:56:24.610]  Because it's all make-believe.
[01:56:25.090 --> 01:56:25.891]  It's all delusional.
[01:56:26.271 --> 01:56:27.472]  They're fabricating everything.
[01:56:27.492 --> 01:56:28.132]  They're scripting everything.
[01:56:28.152 --> 01:56:28.893]  Why are they promoting?
[01:56:28.913 --> 01:56:29.833]  Because I saw the Joker.
[01:56:29.853 --> 01:56:33.215]  The whole thing, worships Antifa and worships mental illness is sexy.
[01:56:33.556 --> 01:56:38.699]  Is that just because Hollywood is so diseased and drugged out that they're just projecting their mental illness on us?
[01:56:39.099 --> 01:56:40.000]  Yes, exactly.
[01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:41.421]  Yeah, they're projecting what they are.
[01:56:41.441 --> 01:56:51.250]  I mean, many of these people in Hollywood, the vast majority, are not only extreme substance abusers like heroin and so on, but also, of course, child traffickers, child molesters, child rapists.
[01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:56.895]  You know, some of them have child... Remember Harvey Weinstein on the airplane with that whole suitcase of all those high-powered drugs?
[01:56:58.041 --> 01:56:59.462]  Uh, yeah, yeah.
[01:56:59.502 --> 01:57:06.107]  So these people are just projecting their mental illness and hoping to sweep America into their twisted world of death and destruction and suffering.
[01:57:06.327 --> 01:57:07.448]  That's what Democrats stand for.
[01:57:07.468 --> 01:57:08.729]  They're the party of death.
[01:57:08.889 --> 01:57:10.570]  This could not be a more epic fight.
[01:57:11.051 --> 01:57:12.332]  MikeAdamsNaturalNews.com.
[01:57:12.352 --> 01:57:13.252]  Your phone calls, I promise.
[01:57:13.472 --> 01:57:16.134]  The next couple of segments, then he's taking over.
[01:57:16.775 --> 01:57:18.676]  Gerald Cilente, but I promise I'm going to your calls.
[01:57:18.716 --> 01:57:19.797]  Bam, bam, bam with Mike Adams.
[01:57:19.817 --> 01:57:20.177]  Stay with us.
[01:57:20.197 --> 01:57:22.399]  This is just so historical, I just can't even believe it.
[01:57:22.639 --> 01:57:26.222]  You can't, I mean, you could cut the suspense with a knife and this isn't a movie.
[01:57:28.291 --> 01:57:31.312]  All right, I want to move quick for the next few segments to get as many calls as possible.
[01:57:31.332 --> 01:57:37.953]  Then Gerald Cilente is taking over for the balance of the fourth hour ahead of the war room with Owen Schroer.

[01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:49.771]  Okay, going back to Mike Adams here, riding shotgun with us.
[01:58:49.791 --> 01:58:50.591]  We're going to go to these calls.
[01:58:50.611 --> 01:58:51.832]  We're going to bring up some great points.
[01:58:52.312 --> 01:58:54.333]  Let's go to Brian in Wisconsin.
[01:58:54.353 --> 01:58:55.413]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:58:55.433 --> 01:58:58.334]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:58:58.354 --> 01:59:01.236]  To start off, I just touched base.
[01:59:01.336 --> 01:59:04.957]  The Meet the Press episode there I saw with Ron Johnson and Chuck Todd.
[01:59:11.487 --> 01:59:20.694]  I spent my morning calling and thanking Ron Johnson for doing that.
[01:59:20.714 --> 01:59:29.161]  It showed what the truth is behind this call with the Ukrainian president and it also showed the corruption of the media and then the bias.
[01:59:29.821 --> 01:59:35.326]  You know, but on another point, you guys were just talking about civil war and possibly here.
[01:59:35.871 --> 01:59:37.071]  What's going on in Iraq right now?
[01:59:59.608 --> 02:00:03.111]  Our government's watching real close what's going on over in Iraq right now.
[02:00:03.491 --> 02:00:06.834]  I hear curfews, I hear numerous dead, numerous injured, right?
[02:00:07.335 --> 02:00:09.397]  I mean, you think they're not watching what's going to happen there?
[02:00:10.558 --> 02:00:12.680]  The deep state's got their ear to the ground on that.
[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:14.721]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[02:00:14.801 --> 02:00:16.283]  I mean, look, as above, so below.
[02:00:16.303 --> 02:00:21.748]  And you've got revolution and war and civil war and killings and happening everywhere.
[02:00:21.788 --> 02:00:23.990]  You've got globalists being thrown out of office everywhere.
[02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:24.870]  You've got
[02:00:26.499 --> 02:00:29.163]  Turkey invading Syria right now?
[02:00:29.183 --> 02:00:33.268]  I mean, I've been focusing on the left trying to overthrow the president, but you're right.
[02:00:33.348 --> 02:00:34.189]  All hell's breaking loose.
[02:00:34.229 --> 02:00:34.830]  Thanks for the call.
[02:00:35.351 --> 02:00:38.275]  Mike, you're a geopolitical wonk yourself.
[02:00:38.575 --> 02:00:39.937]  What do you make of all this movement?
[02:00:40.922 --> 02:00:47.907]  Well, real quick, the deep state in America has been the exporter of death and destruction and suffering all around the world.
[02:00:47.947 --> 02:00:51.669]  And the best way to help the world is to help Trump survive this and drain the swamp.
[02:00:51.729 --> 02:00:55.271]  Then the world will benefit as a result of America being strong and free.
[02:00:55.311 --> 02:00:56.412]  That's my short answer.
[02:00:56.432 --> 02:01:00.775]  And he's definitely trying to stabilize the planet and leave the globalist model of destabilization.
[02:01:02.588 --> 02:01:03.089]  Absolutely.
[02:01:04.049 --> 02:01:06.111]  Look, Trump is humanity's last hope.
[02:01:06.571 --> 02:01:10.874]  Not just America, but really for a free world because Communist China is rising.
[02:01:11.434 --> 02:01:15.457]  Look at their nuclear weapons, their hypersonic missiles, their aircraft carrier factories now.
[02:01:15.477 --> 02:01:16.698]  They're going to be threatening the whole world.
[02:01:17.258 --> 02:01:19.239]  Trump needs to be strong.
[02:01:19.359 --> 02:01:23.122]  America needs to be strong as a sovereign nation, not part of some globalist cabal.
[02:01:23.522 --> 02:01:24.102]  Absolutely.
[02:01:24.142 --> 02:01:25.523]  Let's talk to Dennis in Virginia.
[02:01:25.543 --> 02:01:26.344]  You're on the air, Dennis.
[02:01:28.103 --> 02:01:29.664]  Hey guys, hi Alex and Mike.
[02:01:29.804 --> 02:01:31.365]  You guys are awesome today, great show.
[02:01:31.705 --> 02:01:32.385]  Thank you.
[02:01:32.425 --> 02:01:37.208]  What it's called about the left, it seems as though they keep pushing it further and further.
[02:01:37.228 --> 02:01:44.132]  I'm hoping Trump does do something with all these threats against him, his family.
[02:01:44.152 --> 02:01:45.653]  It just goes on and on.
[02:01:46.033 --> 02:01:50.676]  My question is, didn't they used to arrest people for threatening the president and his family?
[02:01:51.371 --> 02:01:54.793]  I mean, they keep at it because there's no consequences so far.
[02:01:55.373 --> 02:02:01.636]  Well, again, they're trying to say they're going to kill everybody and kill the president on TV, Phil Mudd, hoping somebody does something.
[02:02:01.936 --> 02:02:04.778]  Because when they're calling for martial law and civil war, he goes, hey, that's civil war.
[02:02:04.798 --> 02:02:05.738]  They go, oh, impeach him.
[02:02:05.918 --> 02:02:06.839]  He said civil war.
[02:02:07.259 --> 02:02:09.340]  So they're trying to push Trump into something.
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:14.162]  It's just at a certain point when they've committed all these crimes, push comes to shove.
[02:02:16.383 --> 02:02:18.684]  And notice, too, that the tech giants ban people.
[02:02:19.605 --> 02:02:20.085]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:02:21.843 --> 02:02:22.944]  That's okay, Mike.
[02:02:23.244 --> 02:02:24.285]  Yeah, that's what they want.
[02:02:24.325 --> 02:02:25.506]  I think they keep wanting to push it.
[02:02:25.566 --> 02:02:28.629]  And Mike, you touched on it earlier, you know, about Trump's base.
[02:02:28.709 --> 02:02:33.634]  I mean, I think it's larger than they think, and it keeps getting bigger and bigger thanks to guys like you.
[02:02:34.715 --> 02:02:35.375]  Well, that's it.
[02:02:35.415 --> 02:02:38.698]  They can't intimidate you to back off, the American people.
[02:02:38.739 --> 02:02:40.920]  The more they push, the more it awakens people.
[02:02:40.941 --> 02:02:44.784]  And the globalists are in such echo chambers, I don't think they realize that.
[02:02:44.844 --> 02:02:45.565]  Mike, or do you think they do?
[02:02:47.236 --> 02:03:02.104]  Well, yeah, yeah, they do realize that, but the point I was going to make is that the tech giants consider hate to be conservative ideas, but when leftists or even media personalities directly threaten the president and call for violence and killings and executions, that's not considered hate by the left, that's just considered correct.
[02:03:02.344 --> 02:03:04.606]  That's the way the world should be in their twisted view.
[02:03:04.626 --> 02:03:05.246]  Absolutely.
[02:03:05.286 --> 02:03:06.467]  So that's why those people are banned.
[02:03:06.747 --> 02:03:07.507]  Anything else, Dennis?
[02:03:09.588 --> 02:03:10.889]  No, just a quick plug on that X3.
[02:03:10.949 --> 02:03:12.190]  That's some good stuff, Alex.
[02:03:12.210 --> 02:03:15.832]  I've been using it for about a month and a half, almost two months, and I can really tell the difference.
[02:03:16.735 --> 02:03:17.215]  Thank you, sir.
[02:03:17.256 --> 02:03:18.156]  I really appreciate you.
[02:03:18.176 --> 02:03:24.482]  Yeah, X3 is probably better than X2, but everybody likes X2 because it's the pure, deep-earth crystal type.
[02:03:24.802 --> 02:03:30.408]  But I talked to some scientists and medical doctors and people, and they said, listen, some people can't absorb pure atomic iodine.
[02:03:30.448 --> 02:03:32.590]  Now, a lot of folks can't absorb the other iodines.
[02:03:32.970 --> 02:03:39.539]  But the three together is something that's more holistic and that overall is better.
[02:03:39.559 --> 02:03:47.088]  So it's triiodine, m4store.com, 100% reviews, and it's what I give my children instead of the X2, which is a lot stronger.
[02:03:47.108 --> 02:03:48.069]  People go, wait, this is stronger.
[02:03:48.650 --> 02:03:48.990]  I know.
[02:03:49.190 --> 02:03:50.331]  Different strokes, different folks.
[02:03:51.012 --> 02:03:52.052]  Everybody's bodies are different.
[02:03:52.433 --> 02:03:54.254]  But believe me, iodine is the missing link.
[02:03:54.614 --> 02:03:56.776]  Mike's got some great iodine over at NationalNews.com as well.
[02:03:57.176 --> 02:03:59.137]  Okay, let's keep going to calls.
[02:03:59.177 --> 02:04:00.838]  We see Will in Oregon's been holding a long time.
[02:04:01.479 --> 02:04:02.940]  Another caller was just holding a long time.
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:03.540]  He just hung up.
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:04.741]  We'll go to Will and Alex now.
[02:04:05.181 --> 02:04:07.483]  Will in Oregon, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:04:09.104 --> 02:04:09.885]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:04:10.125 --> 02:04:10.485]  Good, sir.
[02:04:10.505 --> 02:04:11.045]  Thank you for holding.
[02:04:11.065 --> 02:04:11.326]  Go ahead.
[02:04:12.206 --> 02:04:12.506]  Good.
[02:04:12.526 --> 02:04:15.829]  First off, I just want to go ahead and say to you that I'm about to act two.
[02:04:16.109 --> 02:04:17.230]  My family takes it.
[02:04:17.250 --> 02:04:17.670]  I have my
[02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:19.851]  Beyonce take no into his pregnant.
[02:04:19.891 --> 02:04:23.033]  My daughter is just a beautiful, bright, young thing.
[02:04:23.494 --> 02:04:24.835]  Really appreciate everything you guys do.
[02:04:25.835 --> 02:04:27.497]  Thank you.
[02:04:27.557 --> 02:04:30.219]  I just want to say, man, I've just been thinking about it.
[02:04:30.239 --> 02:04:41.607]  I've been listening to you for about 15 years, and it just really gives me a lot of anxiety to think that the divide in this country is just like beyond the point of reconciliation, you know?
[02:04:42.307 --> 02:04:46.710]  So it's pretty scary to think about the way things are going to unfold.
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:50.381]  Sorry, I've been thinking about what to say for a long time.
[02:04:50.401 --> 02:04:53.203]  But think about how far we've come in 15 years.
[02:04:53.223 --> 02:04:54.665]  Nobody knew the Federal Reserve was private, 98%.
[02:04:54.705 --> 02:04:56.806]  Nobody knew about the New World Order.
[02:04:56.826 --> 02:04:57.667]  Oh, that was a good theory.
[02:04:57.727 --> 02:04:58.848]  It's all out in the open now.
[02:04:58.908 --> 02:05:02.971]  So that's why the globalists are pushing so hard, is because they're coming to the end of the line.
[02:05:04.172 --> 02:05:05.053]  Yeah, man, I totally agree.
[02:05:05.093 --> 02:05:05.573]  And you know what?
[02:05:05.613 --> 02:05:11.017]  My brother woke me up, and it's just been a process of trying to get people information, you know?
[02:05:11.838 --> 02:05:15.861]  And it's all you doing, word of mouth, that's changing the world and bypassing big tech censorship.
[02:05:16.929 --> 02:05:21.552]  Yeah and the other thing I wanted to comment on is just about your encouraging people to get into action.
[02:05:21.572 --> 02:05:33.759]  Is there anywhere or is it something you guys could create something to show like I'm in Oregon you know so we got Ron Wyden and stuff and I just would like to be able to get like some bullet points on things that confront people.
[02:05:34.099 --> 02:05:39.202]  Well there's a four-minute promo I haven't aired yet it's been on the website I forget the name of it we might air it.
[02:05:40.034 --> 02:05:41.135]  Right before Solente comes on.
[02:05:41.335 --> 02:05:42.616]  But it gets into how to take action.
[02:05:42.637 --> 02:05:44.618]  We have action at InfoWars.
[02:05:44.638 --> 02:05:45.679]  We can send any videos.
[02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:48.082]  But just go out to public events politicians are at.
[02:05:48.122 --> 02:05:48.962]  Go to city councils.
[02:05:49.363 --> 02:05:51.525]  Anything that's on TV and talk about these issues.
[02:05:51.545 --> 02:05:53.667]  Just get out there and get a buzz going.
[02:05:53.727 --> 02:05:54.408]  Call Congress.
[02:05:54.448 --> 02:05:55.188]  Call Talk Radio.
[02:05:55.228 --> 02:05:55.889]  Call C-SPAN.
[02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:58.191]  You can call C-SPAN and talk to a couple hundred thousand people.
[02:05:59.092 --> 02:06:00.633]  You don't have to save the world yourself.
[02:06:00.694 --> 02:06:01.674]  Just get the ball rolling.
[02:06:02.055 --> 02:06:02.575]  God bless you.
[02:06:03.516 --> 02:06:05.158]  Mike, what are some examples of what people can do?
[02:06:06.604 --> 02:06:13.008]  Well, it's like you said, it's sharing these sources of information since we've all been blacklisted by the search engines and the social media platforms.
[02:06:13.368 --> 02:06:16.651]  And it's really about promoting the alternative platforms, like ban.video.
[02:06:16.671 --> 02:06:19.352]  I mean, I'm so thrilled that you have that platform.
[02:06:19.412 --> 02:06:24.976]  And Brighteon, that you've got, and I want to be clear, if something's blacklisted, folks, that's what you've got to spread.
[02:06:25.016 --> 02:06:27.978]  If it's black, that means they want it in the dark.
[02:06:28.038 --> 02:06:29.779]  That means what's black is what's good.
[02:06:30.159 --> 02:06:31.980]  Get the stuff they want to cover up out.
[02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:32.621]  It's very simple.
[02:06:33.626 --> 02:06:40.089]  That's right, and I just want to say your team invited me to upload videos to Band.Video very soon.
[02:06:40.129 --> 02:06:43.071]  We're doing some special exclusive reports just for Band.Video.
[02:06:43.351 --> 02:06:45.152]  That'll be in just a few weeks, so that's coming.
[02:06:45.472 --> 02:06:47.093]  Well, Mike, your work is all incredible.
[02:06:47.113 --> 02:06:52.976]  We embed your videos in most our stories, and so I'm very honored to have you and other great contributors going to be coming on board at Band.Video.
[02:06:53.236 --> 02:06:54.717]  We post our stuff over at Brighton.
[02:06:55.117 --> 02:06:59.320]  Again, it's all, as you know, a team effort, and I love the fact that you've been so team-oriented.
[02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:01.401]  Well, you've been coming on the show, what, 15 years or so?
[02:07:02.773 --> 02:07:04.937]  Well, I don't know if it was that long, but I tell you what.
[02:07:04.977 --> 02:07:05.678]  How long have you been?
[02:07:05.698 --> 02:07:06.119]  I don't know.
[02:07:06.159 --> 02:07:06.960]  It's been a long time.
[02:07:07.461 --> 02:07:10.767]  I mean, I've been in these studios 12, 13 years, and you've been on at least that whole time.
[02:07:11.721 --> 02:07:15.605]  Well, it's been so long that when I first came on your show, I was a vegan.
[02:07:17.046 --> 02:07:17.647]  Imagine that!
[02:07:19.088 --> 02:07:20.490]  So, you know, things have changed.
[02:07:20.510 --> 02:07:29.899]  I've learned a lot more about food, and today I'll eat good southern Texas barbecue with the superfoods that help protect you against any, you know, burned fat.
[02:07:29.919 --> 02:07:31.120]  Does it not give you more brain power?
[02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:33.483]  I mean, all the studies show human brains got bigger from being made.
[02:07:34.349 --> 02:07:38.151]  What I know now is how to eat healthy and still enjoy life at the same time.
[02:07:38.211 --> 02:07:39.172]  That's the key right there.
[02:07:39.412 --> 02:07:41.073]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[02:07:41.093 --> 02:07:41.834]  Let's take a few more calls.
[02:07:41.854 --> 02:07:42.514]  I know you gotta go.
[02:07:42.854 --> 02:07:46.196]  And then, coming up, I want to introduce Gerald Cilente in the fourth hour.
[02:07:46.316 --> 02:07:48.958]  Bottom line, folks, we're in an incredible historic crossroads.
[02:07:49.318 --> 02:07:51.339]  We're in a fighting position thanks to you.
[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:53.040]  We're all in this together.
[02:07:53.321 --> 02:07:57.203]  In fact, guys, will you print me Cicero on the traitor?
[02:07:57.283 --> 02:07:59.344]  And the man in the arena.
[02:07:59.704 --> 02:08:00.365]  Print me those, please.
[02:08:02.102 --> 02:08:05.083]  All right, let's go right to your phone calls with Mike Adams with nationalnews.com.
[02:08:05.223 --> 02:08:06.803]  I'm Alex Jones with Bandot Video.
[02:08:07.343 --> 02:08:11.624]  Let's go ahead and go to Kenny in Florida, then Alex and Paul, and that'll be it for calls.
[02:08:12.364 --> 02:08:13.965]  Kenny in Florida brings up a point, D.C.
[02:08:14.005 --> 02:08:14.565]  is a district.
[02:08:15.185 --> 02:08:15.725]  Talk about that.
[02:08:16.885 --> 02:08:21.306]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call, and I thank God for you and your great crew every day.
[02:08:21.326 --> 02:08:29.268]  I think it falls under different guidelines, and President Trump has the right to do whatever he needs to do to save what's left of this republic.
[02:08:30.933 --> 02:08:36.496]  Well, and that's really true that he's not offensively saying the Marines are going to go throw somebody out of office.
[02:08:36.576 --> 02:08:40.039]  It's the Deep State saying they're going to throw him out of office outside of law.
[02:08:40.059 --> 02:08:41.079]  They've been saying that on TV.
[02:08:41.119 --> 02:08:42.800]  He'd be crazy not to activate the Marines.
[02:08:43.621 --> 02:08:44.101]  Exactly.
[02:08:44.141 --> 02:08:50.405]  You can't make this stuff up, Alex, and it's time to gird our loins enough and pray and get ready to do whatever we have to do.
[02:08:51.237 --> 02:08:59.242]  Well, Kenny, that's why I'm asking everybody to spread the word more than ever so that even if we go into a physical conflict, we've affected the battle space to a great extent.
[02:08:59.262 --> 02:09:02.124]  You've been holding for like an hour to make some points.
[02:09:02.444 --> 02:09:03.204]  What else do you want to say?
[02:09:04.865 --> 02:09:07.026]  I bought about 50% of everything you sell.
[02:09:07.067 --> 02:09:08.587]  I love all your products.
[02:09:10.429 --> 02:09:17.253]  Man, I can't say enough how much we appreciate what you and your crew, you know, you're spending time away from your families and everything.
[02:09:17.953 --> 02:09:19.094]  My hat's off to you guys.
[02:09:20.123 --> 02:09:20.583]  We love you.
[02:09:20.804 --> 02:09:22.024]  Well, my hat's off to you, brother.
[02:09:22.064 --> 02:09:23.906]  Listen, wild horses can't drag me away.
[02:09:24.446 --> 02:09:25.206]  That's my problem.
[02:09:25.246 --> 02:09:27.308]  I work too much, then I become a jerk to the crew.
[02:09:27.348 --> 02:09:30.190]  And I apologize to them, because I get really mad about this.
[02:09:30.210 --> 02:09:30.930]  This isn't a game.
[02:09:31.431 --> 02:09:33.472]  That's why people call in and say, oh, you're not for real.
[02:09:33.492 --> 02:09:34.072]  You're a fake.
[02:09:34.172 --> 02:09:35.833]  I mean, give me a break, folks.
[02:09:35.894 --> 02:09:37.134]  We just brought the war.
[02:09:37.475 --> 02:09:42.718]  The CIA just put out a book, the left CIA, saying we've got to be taken off the air and that we're kicking their ass.
[02:09:42.738 --> 02:09:43.919]  That means you're kicking their ass.
[02:09:44.219 --> 02:09:45.340]  Mike Adams, you want to speak to that?
[02:09:46.274 --> 02:09:50.256]  Well, you know, Saturday or Sunday, you know, sometimes you and I will talk or text.
[02:09:50.276 --> 02:09:51.916]  We're always working.
[02:09:52.217 --> 02:09:59.040]  Evenings, holidays, you name it, because this fight never ends for freedom and liberty and our republic and protecting our president.
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:04.082]  So we are totally dedicated to this, and I think that's part of the reason why we are still here.
[02:10:04.102 --> 02:10:09.104]  You know, anyone who tries to take us out, they know we'll have fierce resistance.
[02:10:09.404 --> 02:10:13.166]  Well, my middle daughter, my youngest daughter, went to bed at 9 o'clock last night.
[02:10:13.982 --> 02:10:16.144]  And I worked till midnight and I got up at 5 a.m.
[02:10:16.204 --> 02:10:22.208]  and because they were so sweet and so good, I physically had to go research and get ready so I do a better show today.
[02:10:22.408 --> 02:10:22.868]  And we did!
[02:10:22.888 --> 02:10:26.711]  I had to just get my mind in the zone because I was mad about yesterday's show.
[02:10:26.731 --> 02:10:28.873]  It wasn't bad, but I just really had to get them.
[02:10:28.893 --> 02:10:31.194]  I think we've done really powerful broadcast today.
[02:10:31.234 --> 02:10:33.696]  People can see that because I just totally got in the zone.
[02:10:33.736 --> 02:10:36.398]  I dreamed about this for the five hours I was asleep.
[02:10:38.084 --> 02:10:41.868]  Wow, well it's your brain organizing the information for the presentation.
[02:10:42.368 --> 02:10:44.410]  Look, your show's fantastic.
[02:10:44.710 --> 02:10:46.392]  Your information is light years ahead.
[02:10:46.432 --> 02:10:47.473]  It's not that good a lot of the time.
[02:10:47.493 --> 02:10:48.614]  The point is we're fighting hard.
[02:10:48.914 --> 02:10:51.176]  I'm just letting the listeners know we appreciate them and I appreciate you.
[02:10:51.437 --> 02:10:52.798]  You talk about organizing things.
[02:10:52.838 --> 02:10:53.799]  We couldn't do it without you, Mike.
[02:10:55.051 --> 02:10:55.531]  Well, you know what?
[02:10:55.651 --> 02:10:56.952]  It's a team effort for this nation.
[02:10:57.192 --> 02:10:59.232]  And, you know, you and I aren't going to be around forever.
[02:10:59.452 --> 02:11:07.875]  But while we're here, while we're on this planet, while we're, you know, serving, frankly, the interests of God, we are just here to help defend life and liberty.
[02:11:08.115 --> 02:11:08.576]  And that's it.
[02:11:08.796 --> 02:11:10.096]  And we're going to do it for as long as we can.
[02:11:10.116 --> 02:11:10.716]  End of story.
[02:11:11.757 --> 02:11:13.997]  I got to tell you, that's the thing.
[02:11:14.017 --> 02:11:16.338]  When listeners thank me, it's a privilege to do this.
[02:11:16.378 --> 02:11:17.338]  It's what we're meant to do.
[02:11:17.358 --> 02:11:20.860]  My cells, everything, go, this is what I'm supposed to do.
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:23.981]  The satisfaction of this is, I mean,
[02:11:25.646 --> 02:11:27.506]  That's why people think, oh, it's hard to fight tyranny.
[02:11:27.526 --> 02:11:29.367]  Yeah, they go after you and physically things.
[02:11:29.627 --> 02:11:31.307]  It doesn't matter when the spirits lined up.
[02:11:33.368 --> 02:11:34.548]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:11:34.648 --> 02:11:47.851]  I mean, at the end of every day, we can go home knowing in our hearts and in our minds, even at a spiritual level, that we are fighting the good fight for freedom for all human beings, for life for all human beings, including the unborn.
[02:11:47.871 --> 02:11:52.132]  And that's something that goes with us beyond this lifetime, by the way.
[02:11:52.172 --> 02:11:54.072]  There's a spiritual element to this that, you know,
[02:11:55.171 --> 02:11:56.912]  It almost can't even be comprehended on this planet.
[02:11:56.932 --> 02:11:57.733]  Let me be clear, I agree.
[02:11:57.853 --> 02:12:01.877]  It's not a goody-two-shoes thing, like, oh, we're goodies, we're saving everyone.
[02:12:01.957 --> 02:12:06.121]  No, we're humans under attack, we're men, we realize it, and so we're in the fight.
[02:12:06.341 --> 02:12:09.544]  And I'm telling people, man, you're missing out if you aren't fully committed.
[02:12:09.585 --> 02:12:12.988]  You'll be so alive, for those of you that serve evil, if you just renounce the devil.
[02:12:14.008 --> 02:12:16.350]  Well, and they're literally going to burn in hell.
[02:12:16.670 --> 02:12:22.874]  Their souls will burn in hell, and they will suffer a thousand times over for the suffering that they caused on this planet.
[02:12:23.854 --> 02:12:26.396]  Those days are coming for them, and I pity them.
[02:12:26.556 --> 02:12:31.500]  I pity them, and I pray for them, too, because maybe they still have a chance to turn around while they're alive.
[02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:34.101]  Maybe they could do something good for a change, but who knows?
[02:12:34.161 --> 02:12:34.962]  We'll have to watch and see.
[02:12:35.382 --> 02:12:35.762]  Amazing.
[02:12:35.822 --> 02:12:36.222]  It's true.
[02:12:36.362 --> 02:12:37.783]  And what comes around goes around, folks.
[02:12:37.823 --> 02:12:40.124]  You will pay for what you've done in this life and the next.
[02:12:40.164 --> 02:12:41.725]  Thank you, Mike Adams, NaturalNews.com.
[02:12:42.005 --> 02:12:43.926]  A few more calls and Joe Celente's taking over.
[02:12:43.966 --> 02:12:44.626]  He's ready, too.
[02:12:45.647 --> 02:12:46.527]  He's in the dugout.
[02:12:46.547 --> 02:12:47.888]  He's coming out like a raging bull.
[02:12:48.148 --> 02:12:48.548]  Stay with us.
[02:12:50.011 --> 02:12:53.714]  From Kingston, New York, TrendsResearch.com, Gerald Cilente taking over.
[02:12:54.295 --> 02:12:57.458]  In just a few minutes, I promise to get to every caller that got in on the phone lines.
[02:12:58.019 --> 02:13:04.705]  These are like call 25 and 26 we're going to go to, so we're getting that goal to take more calls, and the listeners are loving it, I'm loving it.
[02:13:05.025 --> 02:13:06.346]  It's all the great points you bring up.
[02:13:07.127 --> 02:13:09.609]  Let's talk to Paul and then Alex, or Alex and then Paul.
[02:13:09.629 --> 02:13:10.350]  Who's been holding longest?
[02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:10.991]  That'll be Alex.
[02:13:11.491 --> 02:13:13.853]  Alex, in the great state of Texas, you're on the air.
[02:13:13.893 --> 02:13:14.214]  Welcome.
[02:13:15.848 --> 02:13:16.388]  Alrighty.
[02:13:16.989 --> 02:13:24.091]  I don't think impeachment is going to work, but I think they're going to use an economic collapse in a way to remove him.
[02:13:24.452 --> 02:13:25.812]  That's what my worry is.
[02:13:26.232 --> 02:13:30.354]  And a criticism I have with Trump has to do with the economy.
[02:13:31.054 --> 02:13:38.538]  Now, candidate Trump was really emphasizing just how inaccurate they measure GDP and, you know, the Federal Reserve and all that.
[02:13:38.598 --> 02:13:41.419]  He's kind of gone off track a little bit on that.
[02:13:42.559 --> 02:13:43.940]  You know, you're a million percent
[02:13:44.972 --> 02:13:45.713]  Right about that.
[02:13:45.893 --> 02:13:47.194]  But that's what he had to deal with.
[02:13:47.554 --> 02:13:50.977]  The China and others are in a giant deflation operation.
[02:13:51.617 --> 02:13:52.818]  We're in an economic war.
[02:13:53.479 --> 02:13:55.920]  And as soon as Trump got in, they tried to kill the economy further.
[02:13:55.981 --> 02:13:58.102]  So he said, well, damn if you do, damn if you don't.
[02:13:58.522 --> 02:14:01.004]  So we got into an inflation war with them that's super bad.
[02:14:01.084 --> 02:14:03.146]  But the alternative, he believed, was worse.
[02:14:03.186 --> 02:14:06.188]  If they stalled the economy completely, they would have already removed him.
[02:14:06.228 --> 02:14:07.670]  But they're trying to kill it now to do that.
[02:14:08.590 --> 02:14:09.611]  So Gerald Celente is right.
[02:14:09.991 --> 02:14:11.713]  Best thing Trump said is we don't need China.
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:13.441]  There was a great South Park
[02:14:39.785 --> 02:14:46.331]  I was told about that last week by Connor in there, and I need to play that.
[02:14:46.951 --> 02:14:47.952]  Tell me about the episode.
[02:14:48.873 --> 02:14:53.737]  Well, they're just showing how they're buying up everything.
[02:14:53.797 --> 02:14:55.398]  They're using entertainment.
[02:14:56.219 --> 02:14:57.700]  We're kind of selling ourselves out.
[02:14:57.841 --> 02:14:59.422]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:14:59.858 --> 02:15:24.954]  Boy, I gotta tell you, I was the first 18 years ago to say that China was buying up Hollywood because I was out in Hollywood and learned it from most people, you know, meet high-powered producers or, I mean, I'm talking the lawyer for Steven Spielberg, the lawyers for, you know, people like Mark Berg, the lawyers for people, I'm not name-dropping here, I got out of there as quick as I could, for people like James Cameron.
[02:15:25.495 --> 02:15:27.176]  I mean, I'm talking, you know, the lawyers.
[02:15:28.451 --> 02:15:29.472]  And others.
[02:15:30.532 --> 02:15:33.574]  And they were just openly talking about the Chai comms taking over and buying everything.
[02:15:35.135 --> 02:15:36.176]  So I saw it for myself.
[02:15:36.216 --> 02:15:36.656]  God bless you.
[02:15:36.676 --> 02:15:37.537]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:38.057 --> 02:15:40.298]  People sure made jokes about that when I talked about it.
[02:15:40.379 --> 02:15:49.504]  Now the NBA bows to Communist China and says, we'll fire our manager that said he supports people not being killed by the Chinese military in Hong Kong.
[02:15:49.544 --> 02:15:50.505]  We're sorry.
[02:15:50.745 --> 02:15:51.645]  They said too late.
[02:15:52.046 --> 02:15:56.288]  Same group that bought Reddit and banned the Donald said, oh,
[02:15:58.134 --> 02:16:02.237]  Well, you know, you're not going to get to go into the China now via Tencent.
[02:16:02.717 --> 02:16:03.858]  I mean, it's pathetic.
[02:16:04.738 --> 02:16:06.319]  Big article up on Infowars.com.
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:07.820]  Then they came for Joe Rogan.
[02:16:07.860 --> 02:16:09.121]  Meant to play it today, didn't have time.
[02:16:09.141 --> 02:16:13.304]  But it's really a good report where I just say, look, Joe, I told you all this.
[02:16:13.964 --> 02:16:17.167]  You could help lead us out of all this censorship, but instead you're going to wait.
[02:16:17.187 --> 02:16:19.148]  They're going to carve you down to nothing before they're done.
[02:16:20.162 --> 02:16:25.323]  That's why I really went after Joe meanly to get him to try to wake up, but I didn't want to be fed the bone to get on the show.
[02:16:25.883 --> 02:16:29.744]  I wanted him to understand what was going to happen.
[02:16:29.764 --> 02:16:30.804]  He's a smart guy, man.
[02:16:31.044 --> 02:16:33.705]  People go, oh, Joe Rogan, you know, is he smart, is he not?
[02:16:33.745 --> 02:16:34.685]  No, I know Joe real well.
[02:16:34.925 --> 02:16:36.206]  He knows everything I know and more.
[02:16:36.446 --> 02:16:37.226]  He's super smart.
[02:16:37.506 --> 02:16:38.326]  He knows all this stuff.
[02:16:39.146 --> 02:16:42.407]  And he thinks he can, you know, walk a tightrope, and I'm sorry you can't do that.
[02:16:43.450 --> 02:16:45.171]  Gotta decide which side you're on, Joe.
[02:16:45.972 --> 02:16:47.693]  One more call, then Gerald Cilente's taking over.
[02:16:48.393 --> 02:16:50.094]  Paul in South Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:16:50.254 --> 02:16:50.755]  Welcome, sir.
[02:16:52.236 --> 02:16:52.676]  Hello.
[02:16:53.096 --> 02:16:55.218]  First of all, big fan of your show.
[02:16:55.498 --> 02:16:56.578]  Loving every bit of it.
[02:16:57.319 --> 02:16:59.320]  Keeping America great with your podcast.
[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:01.061]  And I just have a quick question.
[02:17:01.081 --> 02:17:03.203]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:03.923 --> 02:17:08.406]  So, you've been banned by Twitter, YouTube, and you've been
[02:17:09.372 --> 02:17:14.736]  Trash by the mainstream media for saying the truth, which I respect.
[02:17:15.596 --> 02:17:25.043]  So, like, I just gotta ask you, like, how do you keep yourself motivated and how do you just not give up the way you do, which is admirable about you, by the way.
[02:17:25.163 --> 02:17:27.004]  I wish I could grow up and be just like you.
[02:17:28.490 --> 02:17:30.711]  Well sir, let me just explain a paradigm shift here.
[02:17:31.391 --> 02:17:32.411]  I am nothing special.
[02:17:32.592 --> 02:17:33.672]  I'm just primitive.
[02:17:34.352 --> 02:17:38.274]  But nowadays being domesticated means you're stupid, you're weak, you're passive, you give in.
[02:17:38.714 --> 02:17:40.214]  Which we all do to a certain extent.
[02:17:40.895 --> 02:17:42.955]  I'm weak and soft compared to my ancestors.
[02:17:43.355 --> 02:17:46.937]  My ancestors didn't have the access to medicine I have or even knowledge itself.
[02:17:47.617 --> 02:17:54.324]  But they had common sense and on average were much tougher and much more rugged and much more inventive and lived close to the ground.
[02:17:54.684 --> 02:17:57.427]  And so they were street smart.
[02:17:57.747 --> 02:17:59.569]  They were smart to the ways of the wild.
[02:18:00.289 --> 02:18:01.290]  They were more rugged.
[02:18:02.205 --> 02:18:06.247]  And so people say, what's it like to be under attack and lied about and demonized?
[02:18:06.907 --> 02:18:08.568]  Why that's a sign of failure.
[02:18:09.008 --> 02:18:10.289]  No, no, that's a sign of success.
[02:18:10.969 --> 02:18:16.211]  If you're a cruise missile coming in to deliver a nuclear weapon over your enemy, you're going to have radar shooting at you.
[02:18:16.231 --> 02:18:19.953]  You're going to have high powered Aegis guns trying to shoot you down.
[02:18:19.973 --> 02:18:22.414]  You're going to have countermeasure missiles trying to stop you.
[02:18:22.815 --> 02:18:25.736]  You get into the target, detonate and vaporize the enemy.
[02:18:26.036 --> 02:18:27.577]  You've been destroyed, but you just won.
[02:18:28.277 --> 02:18:29.498]  Now, I don't want to die in this.
[02:18:29.558 --> 02:18:30.278]  I'm not fatalistic.
[02:18:30.318 --> 02:18:32.340]  But if I need to, I'll step up right now.
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:34.581]  And so, that's what this is all about.
[02:18:34.641 --> 02:18:42.066]  Because I'm not going to sit here and watch a bunch of evil people that are anti-human take over and destroy our destiny and domesticate us even further on purpose.
[02:18:43.126 --> 02:18:48.510]  I want us to make it to the next level because my very genes, my genetics, my cells cry out for it.
[02:18:50.191 --> 02:18:54.319]  It's admirable to want to survive and to realize I'm trying to change things.
[02:18:54.359 --> 02:18:57.384]  I'm not trying to make friends with the system or get a bigger house or a better car.
[02:18:57.805 --> 02:18:59.448]  If we have freedom, that'll all come with it.
[02:18:59.688 --> 02:19:00.830]  But that's a side issue.
[02:19:01.111 --> 02:19:01.732]  I want freedom.
[02:19:02.657 --> 02:19:03.617]  The spirit of liberty.
[02:19:03.757 --> 02:19:12.541]  I want that true power for my progeny to be able to have a chance to live like they want to and have their own destiny, not be told who they'll be or what they're going to be.
[02:19:12.561 --> 02:19:22.825]  Just like Joe Celente talks about, if he was brought up in Italy today, he wouldn't be able to be super successful in all these number one New York Times bestselling books and, you know, all the things he's done because he'd be in a caste system.
[02:19:23.225 --> 02:19:23.986]  Same thing with India.
[02:19:24.006 --> 02:19:26.227]  But in America, he had a chance to be who he was.
[02:19:27.087 --> 02:19:29.028]  You know, same thing for so many other great Americans.
[02:19:29.608 --> 02:19:32.851]  I don't want to start harping on Italians, but like Frank Sinatra, think he could be like that in Italy?
[02:19:33.071 --> 02:19:33.651]  No, he couldn't be.
[02:19:33.871 --> 02:19:36.874]  You think somebody, you know, from Germany or Japan could do that in their country?
[02:19:36.914 --> 02:19:37.114]  No.
[02:19:37.394 --> 02:19:38.095]  Here, they could do it.
[02:19:38.355 --> 02:19:39.436]  And we're losing that.
[02:19:39.796 --> 02:19:42.758]  You know, in other countries, it wasn't about merit who was a general.
[02:19:42.978 --> 02:19:44.820]  It wasn't about merit who was the top artist.
[02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:46.261]  It was about who your family was.
[02:19:46.481 --> 02:19:48.783]  In America, it was about merit, to a great extent.
[02:19:49.063 --> 02:19:49.964]  We're losing that.
[02:19:50.684 --> 02:19:53.606]  And so it's an honor to be attacked, to be a sacrificial lamb.
[02:19:53.927 --> 02:20:00.852]  It's an honor to have these enemies lie about me, because I believe in you, and I believe we're going to make it through all this, and I believe we're going to change things.
[02:20:00.892 --> 02:20:04.034]  But leadership isn't about just how well you speak or whatever.
[02:20:04.314 --> 02:20:16.704]  It's about willing to go under the knife, to be attacked, to be shot up, to have broken bones, literally and figuratively, to get an idea out there so that it takes root and in the end flourishes.
[02:20:17.324 --> 02:20:20.485]  With all great civilization came incredible sacrifice.
[02:20:21.045 --> 02:20:29.747]  And so, I spiritually am ready to pay it back for those that brought me where I am, for others in the future, because I'm a very selfish person.
[02:20:30.307 --> 02:20:36.588]  And I know I live on through my progeny and through the great dream and through the great things my children and grandchildren and their children are going to have.
[02:20:36.928 --> 02:20:38.849]  So it's very selfish to stand up against evil.
[02:20:39.309 --> 02:20:39.869]  In a good way.
[02:20:40.050 --> 02:20:41.110]  People think, oh, it's giving.
[02:20:41.170 --> 02:20:41.450]  No.
[02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.991]  No.
[02:20:42.051 --> 02:20:45.573]  Being a slave of the devil system is sick.
[02:20:45.873 --> 02:20:46.333]  It's a joke.
[02:20:46.413 --> 02:20:47.274]  I don't want to be a slave.
[02:20:47.734 --> 02:20:49.615]  And so I want to be free.
[02:20:49.855 --> 02:20:54.378]  And that means that it's the exercise of resistance that is the destination.
[02:20:54.538 --> 02:21:02.142]  It is the exercise of standing up and being sovereign and real and standing for who you really are and being legitimate and being
[02:21:04.003 --> 02:21:07.004]  Original and authentic instead of fake.
[02:21:07.244 --> 02:21:08.785]  I'm not a follower, I'm a leader.
[02:21:09.205 --> 02:21:10.885]  And so this is the journey, the path.
[02:21:10.945 --> 02:21:12.746]  My God, I've won the frickin' lottery!
[02:21:13.826 --> 02:21:15.707]  They imprison me, if they kill me, I still win.
[02:21:15.887 --> 02:21:17.347]  Because I was real to the end.
[02:21:17.648 --> 02:21:18.368]  And I delivered.
[02:21:18.408 --> 02:21:19.448]  And I changed the world.
[02:21:19.668 --> 02:21:21.929]  And I measured up to my ancestors already.
[02:21:22.129 --> 02:21:23.669]  And I intend to go the whole way!
[02:21:24.030 --> 02:21:25.230]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:28.151]  Gerald Celente is about to take over, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:28.931 --> 02:21:44.530]  The only way the enemy can shut us down is to put a bullet in my head or if you don't finance us and they're already shutting everything down so we're gonna have a big victory believe me we've already got the jump on them we knew it was all coming and so we're dug in and it's gonna be one hell of a fight but I gotta tell you just get coffee get
[02:21:44.650 --> 02:21:48.834]  Get fish oil, get turmeric, get all the great water filters, air filters, stuff you already need.
[02:21:49.035 --> 02:21:53.099]  Non-GMO heirloom seeds, great films, great books, great t-shirts, great ball caps.
[02:21:53.159 --> 02:21:54.660]  It's all there at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:21:54.901 --> 02:22:00.747]  You get great stuff you need, you finance us, and it totally pisses off the globalists that they're unable to shut us down.
[02:22:01.167 --> 02:22:02.628]  And it's all about an information war.
[02:22:02.648 --> 02:22:03.808]  Will InfoWars save the world?
[02:22:03.868 --> 02:22:04.068]  No.
[02:22:04.328 --> 02:22:06.069]  But will you save the world, all of us together?
[02:22:06.129 --> 02:22:06.629]  Damn right!
[02:22:06.849 --> 02:22:14.952]  Because rolling over to these people to let them control the future and dominate our minds and tell us to roll over and die and that we don't have any effect in the world is a damn lie!
[02:22:15.132 --> 02:22:16.632]  The new renaissance is almost here!
[02:22:16.892 --> 02:22:21.834]  If we don't launch the new renaissance, then we're going to have nuclear war and starvation and kill our damn future!
[02:22:22.074 --> 02:22:24.255]  Why the hell would we do that like a bunch of jerks?
[02:22:24.835 --> 02:22:26.676]  Look at our ancestors, all the stuff they built.
[02:22:26.996 --> 02:22:28.376]  Look what we built today, a bunch of crap.
[02:22:28.577 --> 02:22:31.418]  We're going to go to the future by going back to the future.
[02:22:31.738 --> 02:22:33.098]  Gero Salente takes over.
[02:22:33.118 --> 02:22:34.619]  Really appreciate the crew today.
[02:22:34.919 --> 02:22:35.479]  So much more.
[02:22:35.499 --> 02:22:37.560]  Hey, welcome.
[02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:39.841]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:39.881 --> 02:22:40.761]  Great to be here.
[02:22:41.882 --> 02:22:47.084]  Alex was saying so much in so little time as I'm waiting to go on the air.
[02:22:47.444 --> 02:22:54.487]  I can't remember everything, but what he said was very heartwarming to me and very true to my soul.
[02:22:55.717 --> 02:23:00.358]  And when one of the callers asked him, you know, about, you know, what he was doing and it was great things.
[02:23:00.398 --> 02:23:03.499]  Now, Alex said, you know, I can't compare to the ancestors.
[02:23:04.299 --> 02:23:07.220]  You know, they really fought, you know, they had street knowledge.
[02:23:08.561 --> 02:23:14.042]  And boy, you know, I'm listening to them and it's just, you know, warming my heart because I feel the same way.
[02:23:14.782 --> 02:23:17.303]  I couldn't hold a candle to my ancestors.
[02:23:18.123 --> 02:23:20.804]  And, you know, the time when they came to America, by the way,
[02:23:22.076 --> 02:23:26.357]  They didn't like Italians when they came to America.
[02:23:27.397 --> 02:23:29.017]  We were discriminated against.
[02:23:29.057 --> 02:23:30.758]  They used to call us guineas and wops.
[02:23:31.938 --> 02:23:32.998]  I'm up here in Kingston.
[02:23:33.038 --> 02:23:36.839]  I belong to the Ulster County Italian American Foundation.
[02:23:36.879 --> 02:23:42.120]  Matter of fact, this coming Sunday, we have the Italian Festival.
[02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:43.720]  Columbus Day weekend.
[02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:45.841]  I'm not allowed to say Columbus Day, huh?
[02:23:46.121 --> 02:23:46.341]  Yeah.
[02:23:47.461 --> 02:23:47.801]  Anyway.
[02:23:48.542 --> 02:23:55.547]  And they tell the stories that when there's a lot of Italians in Ulster County, we're 90 miles north of New York City.
[02:23:56.188 --> 02:24:02.813]  They used to have brickyards here and they and stone, you know, used to bring all this stone.
[02:24:02.833 --> 02:24:05.195]  They're building New York City, this whole area.
[02:24:05.235 --> 02:24:08.057]  They're bringing stuff down the Hudson River, right on the Hudson River.
[02:24:08.077 --> 02:24:12.340]  And so they brought on all these masons and all these craftsmen from Italy.
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:14.842]  And they tell the stories into the 40s and 50s.
[02:24:16.906 --> 02:24:22.529]  How Italians couldn't buy a house in the white sections of Kingston.
[02:24:23.570 --> 02:24:34.977]  You know, so what Alex is talking about is, you know, how we lifted ourselves up and how you had pride in yourself and elegance and you had standards.
[02:24:35.597 --> 02:24:36.738]  These people fought.
[02:24:37.318 --> 02:24:43.602]  As he said, you know, we have it easy now with all the things that are available to us.
[02:24:44.417 --> 02:24:50.602]  So I thank everything that I am to the ancestors, you know.
[02:24:51.342 --> 02:24:57.007]  And as he said, you know, I couldn't be me if I was born in Alta Vila Appena, Vicoquens in Italy.
[02:24:57.027 --> 02:25:02.051]  I'm only because, me, because I'm Monopoly Donald, born in the Bronx.
[02:25:02.831 --> 02:25:05.653]  You know, my blood is Italian, but my heart is American.
[02:25:06.434 --> 02:25:11.318]  And I write about that in everything that I've been writing, and I've been writing for many years.
[02:25:12.153 --> 02:25:14.675]  Magazine, The Trends Journal, my best-selling books.
[02:25:15.176 --> 02:25:19.539]  But my favorite is what Zizi, Z-I-Z-I, gave Honey Boy.
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:23.723]  And Zizi is the Neapolitan dialect for your auntie.
[02:25:24.404 --> 02:25:27.626]  So, Zia means aunt and Zizi was your auntie.
[02:25:28.447 --> 02:25:33.672]  And the name of the book, What Zizi Gave Honey Boy, she used to call me Honey Boy.
[02:25:33.692 --> 02:25:39.757]  A true story about love, wisdom,
[02:25:41.343 --> 02:25:43.124]  And the soul of America.
[02:25:44.525 --> 02:25:45.846]  And that's what's lost.
[02:25:46.947 --> 02:25:49.229]  The soul of America.
[02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:53.792]  What the ancestors brought to this country.
[02:25:54.753 --> 02:26:03.640]  And I write about how my grandfather, may they all rest in peace, he used to be the first one online to go vote on election day.
[02:26:04.601 --> 02:26:09.925]  He was so proud to be Americans for all this country that gave us.
[02:26:10.970 --> 02:26:13.351]  And he got people complaining about this and that.
[02:26:13.391 --> 02:26:15.351]  Hey, who's perfect in their lives?
[02:26:16.592 --> 02:26:18.472]  Yeah, Americans did terrible things.
[02:26:18.532 --> 02:26:22.373]  The genocide against, you know, indigenous people.
[02:26:23.954 --> 02:26:26.495]  And the continuing genocide against us.
[02:26:28.395 --> 02:26:30.056]  Are you worried about climate change?
[02:26:30.956 --> 02:26:32.316]  How about all the poisons?
[02:26:33.317 --> 02:26:37.278]  They're dumping into our water, into the air and into the food.
[02:26:38.151 --> 02:26:40.052]  You like all those vaccinations?
[02:26:40.132 --> 02:26:41.212]  Oh, I can't say that.
[02:26:42.253 --> 02:26:48.135]  How about all those chemicals injected into our food?
[02:26:49.815 --> 02:26:50.916]  To the whole system.
[02:26:51.076 --> 02:26:55.958]  How about drinking the rotten water laden with lead and other chemicals?
[02:26:58.178 --> 02:26:59.879]  Yeah, it's a different kind of genocide.
[02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:07.562]  So what Alex says about being proud to be who we are and looking back to the past,
[02:27:08.544 --> 02:27:18.729]  And what you can do to achieve and move higher, if my parents, my mother was a drug addict, and I didn't know who my father was, you think I'd have a shot?
[02:27:18.749 --> 02:27:21.790]  I'm only me because of where I came from.
[02:27:22.631 --> 02:27:24.032]  And that's what I write in this book.
[02:27:24.892 --> 02:27:31.635]  And the soul of America, before it's been robbed from us by the multinationals.
[02:27:33.236 --> 02:27:37.398]  When I was a kid, there were fish stores, stationery stores.
[02:27:38.308 --> 02:27:39.389]  Drug stores.
[02:27:40.190 --> 02:27:41.551]  Grocery stores.
[02:27:43.332 --> 02:27:44.694]  Mom and pop shops.
[02:27:45.895 --> 02:27:46.695]  Dress shops.
[02:27:48.817 --> 02:27:49.678]  Men's shops.
[02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:52.720]  Shoe stores.
[02:27:53.821 --> 02:27:55.123]  Not anymore.
[02:27:56.183 --> 02:27:58.145]  Give it all to the big guys.
[02:27:59.426 --> 02:28:05.812]  Get rid of those laws that they had in place that made the immigrants here move up to the middle class.
[02:28:06.567 --> 02:28:08.728]  Kill that Robertson-Patman Act!
[02:28:08.768 --> 02:28:11.230]  Here's to the Clayton Antitrust Act!
[02:28:11.810 --> 02:28:12.390]  Yeah!
[02:28:13.931 --> 02:28:15.592]  Sherman Antitrust Act!
[02:28:15.992 --> 02:28:17.053]  Glass-Steagall Act!
[02:28:17.113 --> 02:28:18.193]  Get rid of them all!
[02:28:18.814 --> 02:28:21.575]  Give all the money to the big guys!
[02:28:22.376 --> 02:28:28.639]  Make us all workers on the Plantation of Slavelandia, the multinational plantation.
[02:28:31.381 --> 02:28:32.521]  So that's where we're at.
[02:28:33.682 --> 02:28:35.403]  And that's where we have to move out of.
[02:28:36.377 --> 02:28:41.799]  We have to bring this country back to we the people, not we the corporations.
[02:28:42.879 --> 02:28:46.421]  Hey, the Supreme Court made us corporations, we the people.
[02:28:46.801 --> 02:28:48.502]  Yeah, to the Supreme Court.
[02:28:49.322 --> 02:28:53.643]  Dressed up in their Judge drag and telling us what to do.
[02:28:55.264 --> 02:28:59.326]  Ripping up the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.
[02:28:59.366 --> 02:29:00.166]  They could care less.
[02:29:02.847 --> 02:29:05.369]  Look at the militarized police system we have.
[02:29:05.410 --> 02:29:07.532]  You break the law, they break your chops.
[02:29:10.014 --> 02:29:10.655]  Big cats?
[02:29:11.055 --> 02:29:12.637]  How about that Obama, huh?
[02:29:13.457 --> 02:29:17.041]  Nothing more than a pathological liar like most politicians.
[02:29:17.081 --> 02:29:20.304]  That's all they are, are pathological liars.
[02:29:20.324 --> 02:29:25.149]  Remember he was going to do the deal for the dirty dealers.
[02:29:26.010 --> 02:29:29.453]  And put him in jail for robbing us of all our money.
[02:29:29.493 --> 02:29:30.954]  Those too big to fails.
[02:29:31.594 --> 02:29:32.995]  Didn't put one in jail.
[02:29:33.015 --> 02:29:35.137]  And he brought in Eric Holder.
[02:29:35.177 --> 02:29:36.238]  Yeah, hold this.
[02:29:37.659 --> 02:29:38.960]  Too big to jail.
[02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:41.982]  As the Attorney General that did nothing.
[02:29:42.002 --> 02:29:46.906]  Except go back to work for the White Shoe Boy firms over there.
[02:29:46.926 --> 02:29:49.808]  Yeah, the Wall Street law firms.
[02:29:52.571 --> 02:29:59.715]  So the only way this country is going to go back to me is to go back to rise is also what Alex said.
[02:29:59.755 --> 02:30:01.536]  I forgot so many things that he said.
[02:30:01.556 --> 02:30:03.317]  A renaissance.
[02:30:05.157 --> 02:30:14.282]  Ale Romana all'antica in the manner of the Romans in the ancients, the Italians said to describe the quality of their work during the Renaissance.
[02:30:14.622 --> 02:30:17.144]  They just went through the Black Plague.
[02:30:18.564 --> 02:30:21.526]  Some 60 percent of Europe was destroyed.
[02:30:22.682 --> 02:30:31.008]  They realized they had to go back to joy and beauty to rise to a higher level.
[02:30:32.229 --> 02:30:33.950]  And that's what we have to do now.
[02:30:35.371 --> 02:30:40.675]  Renaissance, just like Alex Jones said, and I've been saying.
[02:30:41.756 --> 02:30:43.457]  Renaissance 2.0.
[02:30:45.459 --> 02:30:52.124]  We need to go higher and stop letting the low lives drag us lower.
[02:30:53.715 --> 02:30:59.660]  So we're going to be right back, and remember, buy those products from InfoWars stores.
[02:31:00.321 --> 02:31:11.110]  Hey, yes, yes, yes, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and the only reason the Alex Jones Show is here is because, well, not the only reason, but to keep it going, you have to support it.
[02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:12.851]  You have to put your money where your heart is.
[02:31:13.472 --> 02:31:15.514]  And they have great deals going on now.
[02:31:15.534 --> 02:31:17.455]  50% off InfoWars Life, 50% off BrainForce.

[02:31:48.087 --> 02:31:56.094]  My favorite super male vitality with free shipping and double Patriot points.
[02:31:56.655 --> 02:31:58.936]  So the censorship is only going to get worse.
[02:31:59.777 --> 02:32:15.631]  We put one video up a week from my podcasts, The Trends in the News, and the last one we put up, just up now, it's called Monetary Methadone, and that's the injections at the central banks and junk
[02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:19.170]  Injecting into the system to keep it going.
[02:32:19.650 --> 02:32:21.630]  So we get a notice from Google.
[02:32:22.010 --> 02:32:24.651]  We got that word methadone there.
[02:32:24.791 --> 02:32:26.671]  So this thing got to be checked out.
[02:32:27.351 --> 02:32:29.652]  We just can't let you put that there.
[02:32:30.352 --> 02:32:32.933]  That's how strict the censorship is.
[02:32:34.053 --> 02:32:37.434]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:32:39.014 --> 02:32:44.135]  So as I was saying, Alex really nailed it when he talked about
[02:32:45.117 --> 02:32:50.881]  The ancestors, what they've gone through, how hard life used to be and how easy we have it.
[02:32:51.521 --> 02:32:54.103]  And he also said we're the ones that can make the difference.
[02:32:54.803 --> 02:33:05.711]  There are enough of us, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men and women.
[02:33:07.072 --> 02:33:09.673]  Samuel Adams, so you're in charge.
[02:33:10.874 --> 02:33:14.917]  We're putting out the information, the facts, the data, the analysis and the forecasts.
[02:33:15.964 --> 02:33:19.105]  It's up to you to make the change, to think for yourself and do what you can.
[02:33:19.125 --> 02:33:21.226]  Look what's going on in Hong Kong.
[02:33:21.926 --> 02:33:23.487]  Look how the people are fighting over there.
[02:33:24.948 --> 02:33:29.409]  They know that they don't want to be under the dictatorship of communist ruled China.
[02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:34.171]  A little over 7 million people, 2 million of them take to the streets.
[02:33:34.251 --> 02:33:37.592]  We're lucky to get a million people out on a pink pussy hat day.
[02:33:39.493 --> 02:33:40.794]  With a country of over 325 million people.
[02:33:40.814 --> 02:33:40.854]  So...
[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:46.701]  We have to stand up, speak out.
[02:33:46.721 --> 02:33:55.226]  I mean, who got it in their head that we have to take orders from authorities?
[02:33:55.646 --> 02:33:56.506]  What authority?
[02:33:57.307 --> 02:33:58.547]  We're a democratic nation.
[02:34:00.749 --> 02:34:03.010]  This is a lot of baloney and they're taking over.
[02:34:03.950 --> 02:34:05.711]  And so if we don't fight back, we're gone.
[02:34:06.051 --> 02:34:07.292]  Game's over, fight's on.
[02:34:08.212 --> 02:34:12.955]  So moving on to the big issue, of course, as I see it,
[02:34:14.039 --> 02:34:25.306]  Because it's going to affect the equity markets very deeply, and the economy, and the nation, is this BS impeachment process that they're pushing through on the Democratic end.
[02:34:25.326 --> 02:34:29.128]  And it's brought to you by the CIA and the Deep State.
[02:34:30.288 --> 02:34:39.033]  Could you imagine, could you imagine, that we have the CIA spying on the President in the White House?
[02:34:39.214 --> 02:34:40.314]  I'm not making that up.
[02:34:41.715 --> 02:34:43.236]  And of course the headline today
[02:34:44.141 --> 02:34:47.463]  From the toilet paper record, the New York Times.
[02:34:50.345 --> 02:34:55.728]  Second person blows whistle on Trump and Ukraine.
[02:34:56.428 --> 02:34:59.650]  First-hand knowledge could support case for impeachment.
[02:35:01.811 --> 02:35:03.993]  Whistleblower or blowjob.
[02:35:06.014 --> 02:35:07.475]  Look at the hypocrisy here.
[02:35:07.835 --> 02:35:09.896]  Look how they pump that up.
[02:35:10.757 --> 02:35:11.137]  But hey,
[02:35:12.119 --> 02:35:17.741]  If Chelsea Manning blows that whistle, blow him her into jail.
[02:35:19.362 --> 02:35:28.665]  Julian Assange blows that whistle, put that guy in jail, keep him locked up, ruin his life.
[02:35:29.566 --> 02:35:32.527]  Hey, how about Snowden, huh?
[02:35:33.407 --> 02:35:38.209]  Don't blow that whistle about the NSA spying on us.
[02:35:39.386 --> 02:35:43.647]  Watching everything that they do, listening to everything that we say.
[02:35:44.748 --> 02:35:45.868]  Chelsea Manning?
[02:35:45.908 --> 02:35:46.448]  Yeah!
[02:35:47.149 --> 02:35:54.051]  Oh yeah, shows those pictures of those brave guys murdering innocent civilians in Iraq.
[02:35:55.251 --> 02:35:56.692]  Put him in jail!
[02:35:58.272 --> 02:35:59.453]  Julian Assange?
[02:35:59.493 --> 02:36:00.113]  For what?
[02:36:02.799 --> 02:36:06.080]  But hey, pump those whistleblowers up.
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:08.301]  They blow good.
[02:36:08.721 --> 02:36:10.201]  They're good blow.
[02:36:12.342 --> 02:36:14.322]  Job whistleguides.
[02:36:14.783 --> 02:36:15.463]  Or women.
[02:36:16.923 --> 02:36:17.763]  Gotta be equal.
[02:36:17.783 --> 02:36:18.884]  We don't know.
[02:36:21.805 --> 02:36:23.705]  Look how disgusting this is.
[02:36:24.145 --> 02:36:27.406]  And everyone knows I'm not a fan of Trump.
[02:36:27.826 --> 02:36:29.527]  I'm not a fan of any of them.
[02:36:31.138 --> 02:36:33.279]  I agree with Trump on the border issues.
[02:36:33.379 --> 02:36:44.704]  I agree with him on tariffs and redoing the whole trade negotiations with Communist China and NAFTA.
[02:36:45.465 --> 02:36:48.386]  Totally against what he's doing in Venezuela.
[02:36:49.146 --> 02:36:51.768]  Totally against his Iranian policy.
[02:36:53.989 --> 02:36:58.491]  And I'm totally against what they're trying to do to get him out of office.
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:00.961]  This is just Russiagate 2.0.
[02:37:02.482 --> 02:37:05.704]  And we'll call it something else.
[02:37:05.744 --> 02:37:07.085]  We'll call it impeachment.
[02:37:07.565 --> 02:37:09.226]  What's the big deal here?
[02:37:09.246 --> 02:37:11.608]  Oh, I know the big deal.
[02:37:12.008 --> 02:37:28.899]  He wanted to find out the dirty deal that Hunter Biden got his boy, Biden's boy, by getting on the board of directors of Burisma Energy, the largest energy company.
[02:37:29.787 --> 02:37:31.669]  In Ukraine.
[02:37:33.610 --> 02:37:39.035]  And of course he wants to do it for presidential purposes as well to win the Presidential Reality Show.
[02:37:40.076 --> 02:37:42.778]  This is not a national crime.
[02:37:43.279 --> 02:37:51.706]  A national crime is the dirty slime that they should have impeached and should be put in jail.
[02:37:53.347 --> 02:37:55.109]  George W. Bush.
[02:37:56.010 --> 02:38:03.995]  The lying piece of garbage, scummy crap of a human being who lied us into the Iraq War.
[02:38:05.655 --> 02:38:11.399]  And a lot of us knew it, and a lot of us wrote about it, and a lot of us talked about it as it was happening.
[02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:22.585]  How about impeaching the Nobel Piece of Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama?
[02:38:23.883 --> 02:38:40.333]  Allying us into the Libyan war, the destruction of Syria, the Afghan troop surge, and all of those people that, quote, are really good at killing people with drone strikes.
[02:38:42.014 --> 02:38:51.640]  And look at the people that they have on the mainstream media to support the deep state
[02:38:52.697 --> 02:38:54.758]  That's digging it in deep to Trump.
[02:38:56.380 --> 02:38:56.980]  Clapper.
[02:38:57.881 --> 02:38:58.381]  Brennan.
[02:39:00.602 --> 02:39:00.843]  Yep.
[02:39:01.303 --> 02:39:01.963]  CNN.
[02:39:02.944 --> 02:39:03.865]  NBC.
[02:39:04.605 --> 02:39:05.506]  Free Press?
[02:39:06.146 --> 02:39:06.947]  Grow up.
[02:39:08.408 --> 02:39:13.391]  They got the intelligence agencies right there in front of you.
[02:39:13.792 --> 02:39:14.572]  Intelligence.
[02:39:14.952 --> 02:39:17.574]  What an oxymoron word that is.
[02:39:19.135 --> 02:39:20.236]  Right in front of you.
[02:39:21.755 --> 02:39:23.595]  Telling us what we should believe.
[02:39:24.435 --> 02:39:31.117]  And again, that's why you have to support InfoWars, if you want to keep truth alive.
[02:39:32.037 --> 02:39:34.697]  And of course, subscribe to our magazine, The Trends Journal.
[02:39:34.757 --> 02:39:43.279]  And by the way, you get my book, Best I've Ever Written of Anything, with Zizi Gave Honey Boy, when you go to TrendsJournal.com.
[02:39:44.279 --> 02:39:48.840]  So, what Alex is saying, I am 100% behind
[02:39:50.691 --> 02:39:52.012]  When it's against the impeachment.
[02:39:52.592 --> 02:39:53.633]  This is a disgrace.
[02:39:54.673 --> 02:39:55.814]  The facts are all there.
[02:39:56.894 --> 02:39:58.735]  You pick up the toilet paper record.
[02:40:00.256 --> 02:40:01.177]  New York Times.
[02:40:01.497 --> 02:40:02.758]  No waste of times.
[02:40:03.478 --> 02:40:11.422]  A whole front page with nothing more than stupid excerpts from that telephone conversation that Trump had with the Ukrainian president.
[02:40:12.063 --> 02:40:12.963]  Go inside.
[02:40:14.504 --> 02:40:17.966]  Another full page of nothing but stupid garbage.
[02:40:18.959 --> 02:40:20.741]  Coming from the toilet paper of record.
[02:40:22.903 --> 02:40:27.568]  So, support InfoWars, support the truth, and support the Trends Journal.
[02:40:29.069 --> 02:40:30.190]  Hello, hello!
[02:40:30.831 --> 02:40:31.992]  Glad you like the show.
[02:40:32.012 --> 02:40:33.253]  Hope you like the show.
[02:40:33.934 --> 02:40:35.696]  Anyway, great to be here.
[02:40:36.597 --> 02:40:38.759]  And I was mentioning about the impeachment process.
[02:40:38.779 --> 02:40:40.320]  The implications are going to be great.
[02:40:41.061 --> 02:40:42.082]  Go back to when there were
[02:40:42.912 --> 02:40:46.595]  Had the impeachment thing going on with Slick Willie Clinton.
[02:40:46.795 --> 02:40:48.317]  Yeah, you remember that murderer, right?
[02:40:48.397 --> 02:40:56.244]  Oh, you forgot all those 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five that were dead because of the sanctions on Iraq.
[02:40:56.324 --> 02:41:03.009]  And Madeleine, not all that bright on 60 Minutes when she was ambassador to the United Nations for America.
[02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:06.633]  Asked by Leslie Stahl if the
[02:41:08.677 --> 02:41:14.678]  The price of those 500,000 Iraqi children that are dead was worth the sanctions, and she said, yes it was.
[02:41:15.578 --> 02:41:21.359]  Anyway, when Slick Willie was getting impeached, the equity markets were down some 20%.
[02:41:21.779 --> 02:41:25.300]  That's right, 19 point something.
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:28.780]  The markets can't afford to take a hit now.
[02:41:29.361 --> 02:41:33.141]  Because when Clinton was there, we were going through the dot-com boom.
[02:41:34.141 --> 02:41:35.742]  And the markets were flying up.
[02:41:36.562 --> 02:41:37.702]  Now they're being propped up.
[02:41:38.154 --> 02:41:43.476]  That monetary methadone, cheap dough, keeps them flowing.
[02:41:45.656 --> 02:41:48.757]  So, you're seeing a global slowdown happening.
[02:41:49.678 --> 02:41:53.959]  Oh, here's a little headline of just a little bit of interest.
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:01.101]  HSBC to axe up to 10,000 jobs and
[02:42:07.062 --> 02:42:11.164]  When you're looking around the world, eh, let's see here.
[02:42:12.525 --> 02:42:17.987]  In August, Deutsche Bank said it would eliminate 18,000 jobs.
[02:42:19.388 --> 02:42:20.829]  One after another.
[02:42:20.849 --> 02:42:29.913]  They're cutting jobs, the banksters, because they can't make money with all of this cheap money, low interest rates, and there's a global slowdown.
[02:42:30.654 --> 02:42:32.795]  Going back to putting all the pieces together,
[02:42:34.116 --> 02:42:37.218]  The economy cannot afford to take a hit from impeachment.
[02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:44.904]  So when it dries down the market this time, there's not a lot to prop it up like back in the Clinton days.
[02:42:46.265 --> 02:43:03.659]  And I also believe that the Democratic National Committee, which is part of the CIA, considering what they did to Bernie Sanders as well, and how they kept playing the whole Russiagate story, and now they're doing this one, that
[02:43:05.578 --> 02:43:10.859]  They want not only Trump out of there, because Trump's not a member of the club.
[02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:14.560]  He's not one of the White Shoe Boys as much as he tried to be.
[02:43:15.761 --> 02:43:19.302]  He had to build his own country clubs because the White Shoe Boys wouldn't let him in.
[02:43:20.202 --> 02:43:21.982]  Didn't go to Harvard, Princeton or Yale.
[02:43:22.002 --> 02:43:22.983]  They want him out of there.
[02:43:24.703 --> 02:43:25.864]  And who do they want in?
[02:43:26.724 --> 02:43:28.064]  Biden ain't gonna make it.
[02:43:29.485 --> 02:43:34.806]  How about, how about Elizabeth Warren?
[02:43:36.593 --> 02:43:42.155]  One of the things, one of the things, the thing I do every day is I read tons of information.
[02:43:43.576 --> 02:43:45.156]  And I'll just show you.
[02:43:45.477 --> 02:43:49.498]  Outlining salient points of the story.
[02:43:52.499 --> 02:43:53.620]  One after another.
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:55.420]  Where was that folder here?
[02:43:55.480 --> 02:43:56.261]  Here we go.
[02:43:56.321 --> 02:43:56.541]  Whoops.
[02:43:57.541 --> 02:43:59.582]  Yeah, this is a day's work right here.
[02:44:00.542 --> 02:44:04.544]  All these stories, read and outlined, all different information.
[02:44:05.575 --> 02:44:10.238]  From everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere in the world that I can go to.
[02:44:11.518 --> 02:44:13.159]  The Alexandrian Library.
[02:44:13.219 --> 02:44:14.880]  That's the internet today.
[02:44:14.940 --> 02:44:15.901]  You get a lot of stuff.
[02:44:16.982 --> 02:44:27.208]  So what you do is you read and then you start seeing the trends happening and all of a sudden, Warren says donors gave 24.6 million dollars.
[02:44:29.549 --> 02:44:30.570]  This is from one day.
[02:44:31.130 --> 02:44:32.851]  How Warren honed her message.
[02:44:34.926 --> 02:44:36.986]  The business of fearing Elizabeth Warren.
[02:44:37.126 --> 02:44:38.787]  One Warren story after another.
[02:44:39.307 --> 02:44:41.007]  They know that Biden can't win.
[02:44:42.888 --> 02:44:43.668]  It's my belief.
[02:44:43.688 --> 02:44:46.589]  They're going to be pushing Warren.
[02:44:47.389 --> 02:44:48.649]  Could Warren pull it off?
[02:44:50.589 --> 02:44:52.030]  She's going to get the woman vote.
[02:44:53.350 --> 02:44:54.350]  A big portion of it.
[02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:56.011]  More than Hillary Clinton.
[02:44:56.051 --> 02:44:59.071]  I think Trump got more women votes than she did.
[02:45:00.131 --> 02:45:02.812]  And she's going to get the millennial and Generation Z vote.
[02:45:04.540 --> 02:45:09.283]  But it's going to be tough for her to win those swing states.
[02:45:10.384 --> 02:45:11.925]  And that's what the election depends on.
[02:45:13.226 --> 02:45:14.326]  It's not popular vote.
[02:45:15.067 --> 02:45:16.148]  It's electoral votes.
[02:45:17.228 --> 02:45:19.089]  So Trump may still be able to beat her then.
[02:45:19.109 --> 02:45:25.854]  This talk that Trump might withdraw, might end the presidency, I don't see it.
[02:45:26.754 --> 02:45:28.195]  Not as to who he is.
[02:45:28.876 --> 02:45:32.278]  So just I want to end on that note and also that, you know,
[02:45:32.932 --> 02:45:35.773]  Bernie Sanders is, you know, he's out of the race, you know.
[02:45:36.794 --> 02:45:38.414]  That heart attack isn't going to help him.
[02:45:38.434 --> 02:45:44.257]  The cat's 78 years old and there's going to be a negative for him.
[02:45:45.137 --> 02:45:51.060]  So, again, staying on the economy, I just read to you, the big banksters are going down.
[02:45:51.880 --> 02:45:55.162]  You see the money that they're shoving in the QE4.
[02:45:55.802 --> 02:46:01.945]  They're pumping in more money into the banking system with the repos every day.
[02:46:02.639 --> 02:46:08.341]  They said they were going to stop pumping it in on October 10th, and now they're going to November 4th.
[02:46:08.741 --> 02:46:10.001]  They need more cheap money.
[02:46:10.041 --> 02:46:11.742]  They need that monetary methadone.
[02:46:12.422 --> 02:46:14.282]  And again, the banksters are getting hurt.
[02:46:15.042 --> 02:46:17.183]  So the economy is going to go down.
[02:46:18.303 --> 02:46:24.345]  Warren is not giving any, any, any, any examples on how to push it back up.
[02:46:25.478 --> 02:46:30.341]  All she's doing is talking about taxing the rich, which, by the way, I'm in favor of as well.
[02:46:30.881 --> 02:46:32.742]  The billionaires could afford to pay more.
[02:46:33.422 --> 02:46:39.125]  And to me, starting at $50 million to start increasing the taxes, that's okay with me.
[02:46:40.005 --> 02:46:41.746]  Give some back to society.
[02:46:42.187 --> 02:46:46.149]  Let's spread it back because the game's been rigged so the bigs could get more.
[02:46:47.089 --> 02:46:51.511]  So, on the economic front, we're heading toward the Greatest Depression.
[02:46:53.322 --> 02:46:56.984]  The system that I teach in Trend Forecasting is global nomic.
[02:46:57.004 --> 02:47:09.989]  You have to know what's going on in the world, not only in economics and politics, but also whether it's the environment, social change, health, fitness, food, on and on and on.
[02:47:10.549 --> 02:47:22.434]  So I want to just spend these last couple of minutes talking about what is going on in the world and how you can see the global depression starting to heat up and how it's going to get worse and why you should consider preparing
[02:47:22.881 --> 02:47:24.582]  To prosper and prevail later.
[02:47:25.003 --> 02:47:27.265]  And that's what we do with our magazine, The Trends Journal.
[02:47:27.625 --> 02:47:29.426]  So here's just a couple of quick headlines.
[02:47:31.028 --> 02:47:37.493]  Ecuadorian government arrests hundreds and deploys military action against nationwide strike.
[02:47:38.574 --> 02:47:40.595]  Iran's step... No, that's not one.
[02:47:42.917 --> 02:47:46.960]  Sweep of mass arrests in Egypt subdues a protest movement.
[02:47:47.881 --> 02:47:48.441]  For now.
[02:47:49.883 --> 02:47:51.144]  Iraq in flames.
[02:47:52.566 --> 02:47:53.967]  Baghdad in lockdown.
[02:47:55.108 --> 02:47:57.450]  Over a hundred people have died in these protests.
[02:47:59.071 --> 02:48:04.135]  Peru in turmoil, after president suspended.
[02:48:05.997 --> 02:48:07.918]  One story after another.
[02:48:09.219 --> 02:48:21.649]  The foundation of all of these stories, except the one in Peru, which they're trying to, but not really, because he's trying to break up the corruption that the government is running, and this is a new guy from the outside,
[02:48:22.594 --> 02:48:24.455]  It's about the lack of jobs.
[02:48:25.156 --> 02:48:26.857]  It's about the lack of a future.
[02:48:28.038 --> 02:48:32.401]  Take the new job numbers that came out from the United States last week.
[02:48:32.841 --> 02:48:33.562]  Hey, guess what?
[02:48:34.582 --> 02:48:36.844]  No increase in wages.
[02:48:36.864 --> 02:48:37.424]  Nope.
[02:48:38.085 --> 02:48:38.985]  I'm off to the top.
[02:48:40.607 --> 02:48:42.948]  Populism, social unrest.
[02:48:43.328 --> 02:48:45.550]  It's going on globally.
[02:48:46.471 --> 02:48:51.174]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:48:51.798 --> 02:48:53.879]  And they're losing it around the globe.
[02:48:54.520 --> 02:48:57.822]  When this greatest depression hits, it's going to be much, much worse.
[02:48:58.362 --> 02:49:04.486]  Back then in 1930s, eh, 2 billion cats and kittens on the planet.
[02:49:05.466 --> 02:49:11.390]  Now, we've added 5.5 billion more people since then.
[02:49:12.771 --> 02:49:15.814]  You think you got a refugee and migrant crisis now?
[02:49:16.235 --> 02:49:22.121]  I'm showing you what's going on all over the world from South Africa, you name it, South America.
[02:49:22.141 --> 02:49:34.434]  They're going to be flooding out of the Middle East, out of these war zones, out of everywhere to find safety, to get away from poverty, to escape criminality and corruption.
[02:49:36.733 --> 02:49:42.616]  It's going to be one mad, global madhouse as the greatest depression hits.
[02:49:43.596 --> 02:49:48.038]  So we're suggesting is that you prepare, prevail and prosper now.
[02:49:48.699 --> 02:49:51.120]  Because this thing is going to come down hard.
[02:49:51.940 --> 02:49:56.882]  And the impeachment process is only going to speed it up and make it worse.
[02:49:57.743 --> 02:49:59.203]  And another important trend.
[02:49:59.684 --> 02:50:04.986]  Do not spend your time, a lot of it, wasted on this impeachment stuff.
[02:50:05.615 --> 02:50:08.097]  Learn about the current events forming future trends.
[02:50:08.577 --> 02:50:11.259]  And you can learn about them by subscribing to the Trends Journal.
[02:50:11.599 --> 02:50:13.340]  And remember, support InfoWars.
[02:50:13.921 --> 02:50:15.082]  Keep the truth alive.
[02:50:15.642 --> 02:50:16.462]  See you next time.
[02:50:26.049 --> 02:50:34.355]  In the next two minutes, I am asking you very respectfully for your attention.
[02:50:35.202 --> 02:50:41.687]  Because these two products go together like a horse and carriage, and they can change your life in so many ways.
[02:50:42.227 --> 02:50:48.252]  And they also fund the InfoWar, which certainly changes all our lives for the better, because if we weren't here fighting back,
[02:50:49.721 --> 02:50:51.862]  The globalists probably would have already had things sewn up.
[02:50:51.962 --> 02:51:02.009]  I mean, they legitimately think that Infowars has been instrumental in spreading rebellion against their globalist operation and the explosion of populism and nationalism because it's true.
[02:51:02.349 --> 02:51:12.996]  Our guests, our listeners, we the people, have absolutely challenged their corrupt narrative on man-made global warming, on their attacks on the family, their attacks on the Second Amendment.
[02:51:13.476 --> 02:51:16.378]  It is an incredibly beautiful time to be alive right now.
[02:51:16.878 --> 02:51:18.760]  That's because you've been taking action.
[02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:20.942]  But we need funding and you need these products.
[02:51:21.943 --> 02:51:27.869]  Now our Ultimate Bone Broth is the strongest, best formula out there at half the price of leading competitors.
[02:51:28.689 --> 02:51:33.274]  It has great, high quality bone broth concentrate from chicken.
[02:51:33.874 --> 02:51:35.235]  It then has the chaga mushroom.
[02:51:35.356 --> 02:51:38.458]  It has bee pollen, turmeric, and so much more.
[02:51:38.859 --> 02:51:39.560]  So strength,
[02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:42.641]  Stamina, your bones, your muscles, your tendons.
[02:51:42.841 --> 02:51:44.462]  It really is the essence.
[02:51:44.782 --> 02:51:51.885]  As all the ancients, every culture knew, they would boil down bones for health and for life and for comfort and just for focus.
[02:51:52.385 --> 02:51:52.965]  It's incredible.
[02:51:53.645 --> 02:51:57.927]  Now we also have Gut Fusion, which is an amazing product I never promote.
[02:51:58.227 --> 02:52:07.411]  We set out to look at top selling brands of high quality fiber to help slush your guts out, but also other key ingredients that are known for gut health itself.
[02:52:07.471 --> 02:52:09.672]  So you've got to go read about this formula.
[02:52:09.932 --> 02:52:16.637]  It's 50% off, it's $19.95, it's a big canister of the stuff for your wife, your children, your neighbors, your grandparents.
[02:52:16.977 --> 02:52:18.158]  It's a great gift as well.
[02:52:18.458 --> 02:52:21.440]  Both these products are 50% off separately or together.
[02:52:21.460 --> 02:52:25.583]  Again, Ultimate Bone Broth and Gut Fusion from InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:52:32.386 --> 02:52:35.949]  And I will turn this in if it means saving the lives of our kids.
[02:52:36.289 --> 02:52:37.530]  People want to do the right thing.
[02:52:37.650 --> 02:52:41.232]  Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, non-gun owners alike.
[02:52:41.533 --> 02:52:44.435]  I think we're naive to think that we can just maintain the status quo.
[02:52:45.255 --> 02:52:47.157]  Beto knows what he's doing.
[02:52:48.758 --> 02:52:52.181]  He's sitting there telling you that, oh, a man just walked up to me.
[02:52:52.321 --> 02:52:53.101]  It's a total lie.
[02:52:53.702 --> 02:52:58.305]  And said, oh, I'm going to turn in my AR-15 so people don't get hurt.
[02:52:59.306 --> 02:53:00.707]  That's selling the idea.
[02:53:01.806 --> 02:53:06.832]  That if you own a gun, you're responsible for what criminals do with a gun.
[02:53:07.632 --> 02:53:09.855]  That is such a fraud.
[02:53:09.915 --> 02:53:11.677]  It's so anti-American.
[02:53:12.418 --> 02:53:15.081]  Now you can always tell on Beto's lying, his lips are moving.
[02:53:16.403 --> 02:53:17.744]  Or his brain's thinking.
[02:53:18.424 --> 02:53:19.444]  The man's a total fraud.
[02:53:20.104 --> 02:53:26.067]  His father-in-law's worth $28 billion, a big anti-American globalist, gave a billion dollars to Bechtel's wife.
[02:53:26.647 --> 02:53:32.069]  The guy wrote papers fantasizing about killing children, running them over with cars.
[02:53:32.609 --> 02:53:34.170]  He got arrested for a hit-and-run.
[02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:36.270]  He got arrested for burglary.
[02:53:36.650 --> 02:53:38.691]  The man isn't allowed to own a gun.
[02:53:38.951 --> 02:53:40.432]  He is a deranged criminal.
[02:53:41.363 --> 02:53:43.504]  But of course, deranged criminals want your guns.
[02:53:43.884 --> 02:53:52.828]  They're now turning their guns and are facing five years in jail in New Zealand, even though the man that shot those people wasn't from New Zealand and got the guns illegally.
[02:53:53.048 --> 02:53:58.671]  The globalists want to have a revolution against America, and they want us disarmed before they do it.
[02:53:59.011 --> 02:54:03.253]  1776 could commence again at any time, because they're losing their information war.
[02:54:04.093 --> 02:54:05.413]  Against us, because we're telling the truth.
[02:54:06.114 --> 02:54:10.915]  And so now, Beto is making his move with others, and he has to be rebuked.
[02:54:11.415 --> 02:54:12.375]  He has to be exposed.
[02:54:12.475 --> 02:54:19.017]  And the way to do it is not be intimidated about your Second Amendment, and let them know that you're fully aware of what they're trying to do.
[02:54:19.498 --> 02:54:23.939]  Beto's campaign says, if you want to prove you're not a bad person, turn your guns in.
[02:54:24.119 --> 02:54:25.759]  Hey, Beto, you turn your guns in.
[02:54:26.379 --> 02:54:29.941]  It's a campaign slogan where he says, turn them in to show you're good.
[02:54:30.141 --> 02:54:31.541]  Lay down your arms, you're dead!
[02:54:32.247 --> 02:54:32.807]  Hands up!
[02:54:32.988 --> 02:54:33.348]  Come out!
[02:54:33.908 --> 02:54:36.070]  And we'll take you away to the gulag.
[02:54:36.771 --> 02:54:39.133]  They're literally trying to disarm us.
[02:54:39.893 --> 02:54:42.876]  They openly say they want to put conservatives in forced labor camps.
[02:54:42.896 --> 02:54:43.997]  They openly say they want to kill us.
[02:54:44.557 --> 02:54:48.701]  They openly say they want to destroy us because we support Trump or America.
[02:54:49.599 --> 02:54:51.120]  We've got to stand up and say no.
[02:54:51.221 --> 02:54:53.323]  And you've got to fund those that are fighting.
[02:54:53.623 --> 02:54:55.965]  Because we're pro-Second Amendment, we're under massive attack.
[02:54:56.425 --> 02:54:57.807]  Hack attack, lawsuits, you name it.
[02:54:58.187 --> 02:55:06.555]  But you can help us stand against this and spread the word on the street against these bullies with a great shirt like Beto Nye, available at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:55:06.835 --> 02:55:11.400]  But whether it's supplements or a Betsy Ross flag or a water filter or a book or a film,
[02:55:11.900 --> 02:55:17.425]  These are products that are great, that you need, and shopping with us helps us continue to fight for all of our basic freedoms.
[02:55:17.825 --> 02:55:19.526]  Infowarestore.com.
[02:55:19.786 --> 02:55:20.627]  Thank you for your support.
[02:55:20.887 --> 02:55:21.388]  Hell yes!
[02:55:21.468 --> 02:55:26.392]  We're gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47... And it is very hard to think about this.
[02:55:27.573 --> 02:55:32.297]  Um... Bill Gates and his father, who ran Planned Parenthood, are right.
[02:55:33.918 --> 02:55:38.642]  We need to dumb down, sterilize, and abort as many people as we can.
[02:55:39.787 --> 02:55:47.539]  We need to put as much fluoride in the water of those that are born to dumb them down as much as possible so they're more easily managed.
[02:55:48.140 --> 02:55:51.945]  You see, I've decided to try to join Bill Gates and try to start thinking like him.
[02:55:52.751 --> 02:55:57.474]  Worldwide, he directed genetically engineered mosquitoes to bite us and give us diseases.
[02:55:57.994 --> 02:56:00.056]  But he said it was in the name of helping people.
[02:56:00.636 --> 02:56:12.044]  Just like he funded the projects of these, quote, sterilized male mosquitoes that would go out in Brazil and cause the other mosquito populations to implode, but now they mutated and the numbers exploded!
[02:56:12.544 --> 02:56:15.666]  And suddenly the mosquitoes are making people much sicker.
[02:56:16.526 --> 02:56:19.248]  Oh, it wasn't a mistake, none of it was!
[02:56:19.288 --> 02:56:20.049]  Now, I'm hilarious.
[02:56:20.489 --> 02:56:22.209]  Of course, transmitted by mosquitoes.
[02:56:22.689 --> 02:56:23.590]  I brought some here.
[02:56:24.050 --> 02:56:30.551]  There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
[02:56:30.671 --> 02:56:33.412]  Let me tell you, except 5G, 4G, 3G, it's killing us all.
[02:56:33.452 --> 02:56:33.812]  We deserve to die.
[02:56:34.652 --> 02:56:36.892]  And don't go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:56:37.132 --> 02:56:37.572]  Oh, no.
[02:56:38.133 --> 02:56:40.653]  Don't get high-quality fish oil or turmeric.
[02:56:41.053 --> 02:56:42.113]  It fights inflammation.
[02:56:42.373 --> 02:56:44.374]  Don't get any of the great antioxidants we have.
[02:56:44.694 --> 02:56:48.235]  Don't get ultimate bone broth that's selling out at 50% off.
[02:56:48.275 --> 02:56:49.155]  It's the last week to get it.
[02:56:49.935 --> 02:56:55.579]  I don't support organizations and institutions that are independent and fighting for a pro-human future.
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:57:01.244]  Roll over to Bella Melinda Gates, the rightful rulers of this earth.
[02:57:02.044 --> 02:57:05.587]  Do not go to InfoWarStore.com and support me.
[02:57:06.628 --> 02:57:08.609]  And do not spread the articles and videos.
[02:57:09.070 --> 02:57:10.471]  Just give up and submit.
[02:57:10.771 --> 02:57:12.512]  Give your children over to Billy Boy.
[02:57:13.173 --> 02:57:14.174]  Truth is Satan's good.
[02:57:17.489 --> 02:57:18.411]  Alright, thanks for watching.
[02:57:18.873 --> 02:57:20.436]  And thank you Bill Gates for all you do.
[02:57:20.476 --> 02:57:21.579]  Thanks for those mosquitoes.
[02:57:21.940 --> 02:57:22.882]  Thanks for 5G.
[02:57:23.203 --> 02:57:24.126]  Thanks for the chemtrails.
