[00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:19.478]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:19.638 --> 00:00:28.907]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this August 13th, 2019 global broadcast.
[00:00:29.047 --> 00:00:32.971]  I am your host Alex Jones, riding shotgun with Owen Troyer.
[00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:39.138]  And we're going to be here for the next four hours broadcasting, covering all the huge global developments.
[00:00:39.678 --> 00:00:43.120]  Now, yes, the Epstein developments are stratospheric.
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.922]  There's nothing like it that has woken more people up.
[00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:48.903]  We'll be covering that coming up in about 12 minutes.
[00:00:50.204 --> 00:00:53.846]  But first off, the United States really is at war with China.
[00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:56.027]  We've been in a proxy war for many years.
[00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:59.749]  The globalists, the Democrats particularly, but along with the neocons, set it up.
[00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.290]  We were de-industrialized.
[00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:09.778]  And where everything was shipped to China and where it was set up, where they would economically dominate us, where they bought up our debt, they bought up Hollywood.
[00:01:10.478 --> 00:01:14.959]  And there's been really no news coverage of this, but now it's all starting to come out.
[00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.380]  We've been exposing this for really 20 years.
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.222]  The handover of the Panama Canal, all the deep ports, the infrastructure, the control over rare earth minerals, anybody else, U.S.
[00:01:26.262 --> 00:01:28.363]  companies, Russian companies,
[00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:31.603]  Try to go in and get rare earth minerals anywhere.
[00:01:32.023 --> 00:01:33.484]  International courts come after them.
[00:01:33.524 --> 00:01:34.764]  The CIA comes after them.
[00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:49.053]  So China has been positioned to absolutely manipulate currencies, be given all of our weapons secrets, just to be set up to take over in the 21st century, which the Council on Foreign Relations and the globalists have openly bragged about.
[00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:52.295]  What was left of the British Empire that took over the U.S.
[00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:56.398]  after World War I, now is done with the U.S.
[00:01:56.458 --> 00:01:58.179]  and is moving on to China.
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.240]  I want to be clear.
[00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:01.462]  That is not the British people.
[00:02:01.582 --> 00:02:04.843]  That is not the people of Ireland or Scotland or the UK.
[00:02:04.984 --> 00:02:08.405]  That is the globalists that sucked off those people and built an empire.
[00:02:08.746 --> 00:02:12.067]  Then it moved on to the US to suck off us to build a corporate empire.
[00:02:12.488 --> 00:02:16.170]  Now it's moving on to China to bring in its final world government.
[00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.903]  We've had Peter Thiel come out again on Fox Business and lay it all out.
[00:02:20.943 --> 00:02:34.921]  Next segment, I'm going to play a clip of it and say we're really at war with China and that there are post-nationalists in America that are working with China and that Google and Apple and others have moved there and are working against us.
[00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:36.543]  Well, Thiel's a Bilderberg insider.
[00:02:37.443 --> 00:02:39.425]  He's been in the globalist ranks.
[00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:40.626]  He's been a libertarian.
[00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:43.468]  He's been pro-nationalist at many levels.
[00:02:43.488 --> 00:02:50.793]  So we've always said that we weren't sure if he was a good guy or a bad guy because they were trying to bring in the new generation of people to join them.
[00:02:50.813 --> 00:02:54.556]  And not everybody that's part of these globalist systems is actually for it.
[00:02:54.616 --> 00:02:55.657]  They've been working against it.
[00:02:55.677 --> 00:02:58.519]  More and more, Attil shows that that is exactly what he's doing.
[00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:01.381]  But China invaded
[00:03:04.878 --> 00:03:14.043]  As you know, with plainclothes police and military on thousands of motorcycles last month into Hong Kong, they're threatening to physically invade Taiwan.
[00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:17.925]  They're threatening to physically invade with regular army and Navy forces.
[00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:20.506]  This is a powder keg in the South China Sea.
[00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:26.489]  And so now this is really reaching a head.
[00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.231]  It's really coming to a flashpoint.
[00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:37.848]  Because even more troops and more plainclothes have poured in the last three days and are viciously attacking demonstrators all over Hong Kong.
[00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.151]  This intimidation didn't work.
[00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:41.634]  Men, women and children being beaten.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.643]  With these clubs, these metal clubs, having their heads split open, their bodies split open.
[00:03:47.923 --> 00:03:48.864]  Some people have been killed.
[00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:53.846]  Now, they're reporting many, many, many, many times who are already out demonstrating.
[00:03:53.886 --> 00:03:56.448]  Tens of thousands before is now hundreds of thousands.
[00:03:56.488 --> 00:04:03.892]  Some are saying millions, taking over airports, taking over government buildings, taking over anything that the Chai Koms have been in control of.
[00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:11.256]  And even mainstream news admits Communist China has miscalculated in a big, big way.
[00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:23.862]  Communist China has absolutely thought that they could bully and intimidate folks in Hong Kong who've already been pushed to the brink, who are now learning their businesses can be taken with no due process.
[00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:28.323]  They can be arrested and extradited to the mainland and disappear to a slave gulag.
[00:04:28.864 --> 00:04:35.146]  That's what the government that's working with the Chinese is doing, selling out what's left of the Hong Kong freedom.
[00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:37.767]  So instead of going into that long, dark night,
[00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:45.140]  They are saying no, and they are fighting back, and it is absolutely amazing, and the craving of American flags.
[00:04:46.642 --> 00:04:49.865]  It's just incredible seeing America as a symbol of freedom.
[00:04:50.445 --> 00:04:53.628]  We come back with a complete reveal on this and so much more.
[00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:56.731]  Then shift gears to the biggest news yet for Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:04:56.751 --> 00:04:58.953]  He was heard shrieking and fighting for his life.
[00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:01.956]  Yes, clearly, all evidence points to where he was strangled.
[00:05:03.254 --> 00:05:03.995]  Before I started.
[00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.124]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[00:05:23.324 --> 00:05:25.745]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[00:05:26.026 --> 00:05:26.806]  I don't want them to win.
[00:05:27.186 --> 00:05:29.208]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[00:05:30.108 --> 00:05:32.870]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.992]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[00:05:36.372 --> 00:05:40.134]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:41.415]  These will change your life.
[00:05:41.755 --> 00:05:43.136]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:44.857]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:45.838]  Check it all out.
[00:05:45.858 --> 00:05:47.459]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:49.400]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.781]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:52.223]  You get great products at the same time.
[00:05:52.544 --> 00:05:54.688]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:56.953]  InfoWarsLife.com is the supplements.
[00:05:57.193 --> 00:06:00.299]  Take action now and fund the InfoWar for your own future.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:23.804]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:27.626]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, a lot of incredible things are happening across this world.
[00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:29.607]  We're building towards this massive quickening.
[00:06:29.727 --> 00:06:33.029]  Alex Jones here, again, riding shotgun with Owen Schroyer.
[00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:35.130]  Such huge global events.
[00:06:36.207 --> 00:06:40.431]  China has miscalculated with Hong Kong and Taiwan and with the U.S.
[00:06:40.471 --> 00:06:45.555]  taking over much of the South China Sea, now using paramilitary to take over Hong Kong.
[00:06:45.936 --> 00:06:48.578]  They thought that they could intimidate all of the people.
[00:06:48.618 --> 00:06:50.400]  They thought that they could drive them into submission.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.162]  That's caused the protests to grow exponentially.
[00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:57.686]  Second day of the international airport being completely shut down.
[00:06:57.906 --> 00:07:02.991]  And there are large throngs of the hundreds of thousands or even millions of different demonstrators popping up everywhere.
[00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:05.382]  That are waving American flags.
[00:07:05.442 --> 00:07:16.949]  It's truly a beautiful moment where now the world sees America as it used to be a beacon of liberty and freedom, not a beacon of tyranny, backing up the shy comms, taking over the planet, backing up all these other groups.
[00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:20.811]  And there was an intriguing interview with Tucker Carlson a month ago with Peter Thiel.
[00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:26.714]  And Peter Thiel came out and said, look, big companies don't like America.
[00:07:26.754 --> 00:07:27.354]  They're globalists.
[00:07:27.374 --> 00:07:28.155]  They were trained to do it.
[00:07:28.635 --> 00:07:29.696]  It's the Chinese century.
[00:07:29.976 --> 00:07:30.977]  They're all moving to China.
[00:07:31.057 --> 00:07:31.637]  Apple, Google.
[00:07:32.563 --> 00:07:34.464]  They should be investigated for espionage.
[00:07:35.044 --> 00:07:36.685]  And now he's come out and said the truth again.
[00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:39.066]  Again, billionaire, a tech investor.
[00:07:39.827 --> 00:08:00.078]  He says that there are post-nationalists in the West, in America, that don't like our country existing, that say it was never great, never be great, like Chris Cuomo's brother and the governor of New York, and that these post-nationalists, that's what globalists are, they are working with China to carry all this out.
[00:08:00.098 --> 00:08:00.758]  This is such
[00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.131]  A huge deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:09.233]  And so let's go ahead and go to a few minutes of this interview.
[00:08:09.533 --> 00:08:17.056]  The full Fox Business interview is on Infowars.com in a critical Steve Watson article, Paul Joseph Watson's great brother.
[00:08:17.937 --> 00:08:22.099]  And it's so important to get that article out to everyone you know.
[00:08:22.859 --> 00:08:26.941]  So the information is there so Americans know who the true threat is.
[00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:27.461]  Here it is.
[00:08:28.223 --> 00:08:34.850]  It's quite significant that China's intelligence agencies have been seeding people into American companies.
[00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:44.360]  I want to ask you about what's going on in Silicon Valley in terms of espionage, in terms of what's happening with Chinese nationals working within our companies.
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.125]  There are Confucius Institutes in Silicon Valley, right, by Stanford University.
[00:08:49.405 --> 00:08:50.727]  What's your take on all of that?
[00:08:51.047 --> 00:08:53.188]  Well, this gets very speculative.
[00:08:54.188 --> 00:08:57.450]  It certainly would be odd if there wasn't something like this going on.
[00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:05.834]  And again, to zero in on the Google example, where the AI DeepMind effort was described by its own founder as a Manhattan Project for AI.
[00:09:05.854 --> 00:09:16.018]  And so even though this was meant as probably marketing hyperbole in a way, I think that people outside the US might very well take that literally.
[00:09:16.058 --> 00:09:19.920]  And so if you go around saying, here's the Manhattan Project for AI,
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.322]  Do you get pressure because you've supported President Trump?
[00:09:43.117 --> 00:09:44.658]  Well, there's a lot of questions there.
[00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:48.262]  So I think there's always an inside and an outside question.
[00:09:48.302 --> 00:09:50.484]  The outside question is, what are these companies doing with China?
[00:09:51.004 --> 00:09:53.466]  Are they censoring speech?
[00:09:53.867 --> 00:10:01.414]  And the Twitter McConnell thing, you could say it's an innocent accident, or is it an intentional act of political sabotage?
[00:10:01.454 --> 00:10:02.635]  Which of the two is it?
[00:10:03.175 --> 00:10:15.303]  And I think one of the reasons the Republicans are so skeptical of the excuses Big Tech has for these repeated accidents is that the inside story is not good.
[00:10:15.363 --> 00:10:21.107]  Because on the inside, Twitter is not a company where you have lots of people writing checks to Senator McConnell.
[00:10:21.707 --> 00:10:31.295]  You know, if you had a lot of campaign donations from Senator McConnell, we might say, well, to Senator McConnell, we might say this is sort of an innocent mistake and we won't complain about it too much.
[00:10:31.655 --> 00:10:35.378]  That's not what's actually going on.
[00:10:36.098 --> 00:10:48.188]  And it has sort of the feel of a very unhealthy one-party state in a way that's not good for Silicon Valley or for the politics of this country generally.
[00:10:48.328 --> 00:10:54.972]  The president can't even have a fundraiser without, you know, the people getting bullied about that fundraiser.
[00:10:55.833 --> 00:10:56.253]  It's gone.
[00:10:56.273 --> 00:10:58.435]  I mean, it's actually, it's crazy.
[00:10:58.475 --> 00:11:00.916]  It's real Trump derangement syndrome happening.
[00:11:01.037 --> 00:11:09.582]  And it is, it is always, you know, I'm sort of the main outspoken supporter of President Trump inside Silicon Valley.
[00:11:09.742 --> 00:11:14.085]  There are many other people in Silicon Valley who support the president, but they're not going to say it.
[00:11:14.986 --> 00:11:16.907]  And so that's, that's always the problem.
[00:11:17.007 --> 00:11:17.828]  It's unanimity.
[00:11:19.148 --> 00:11:20.489]  Doesn't mean that everybody agrees.
[00:11:20.869 --> 00:11:24.751]  It normally just means that everybody is too scared to speak up.
[00:11:27.592 --> 00:11:28.172]  There you go.
[00:11:28.472 --> 00:11:31.033]  Everybody else is just too scared to speak up.
[00:11:32.334 --> 00:11:33.714]  That's what all the bullying is about.
[00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:36.075]  The left wants a one-party state.
[00:11:36.135 --> 00:11:38.216]  They've been promised incredible power.
[00:11:39.717 --> 00:11:46.620]  Coming up later, if I have time, I'm going to show you the Twitter account of a well-known leftist comedian who saw me at the pool
[00:11:47.794 --> 00:11:57.697]  And then she dreams about coming up and confronting me, and then her Twitter supporters dream about violently kicking me down the stairs, stepping on my hand when my hand's outside the pool.
[00:11:58.057 --> 00:11:59.218]  I've had leftists do that before.
[00:11:59.238 --> 00:12:03.419]  That happened to me in Hawaii two years ago, and physically attacking me.
[00:12:04.339 --> 00:12:08.340]  And then they say, we can't believe that there was a woman and children with him.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.301]  Who are those people?
[00:12:09.681 --> 00:12:12.942]  Oh, I know, my children were taken away from me, the media said.
[00:12:13.002 --> 00:12:13.762]  None of that's true either.
[00:12:15.285 --> 00:12:19.148]  So again, you've got this hunchbacked hag pissed.
[00:12:19.188 --> 00:12:21.149]  I've got a beautiful wife and beautiful children.
[00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.211]  So she also says, I look like a pedophile.
[00:12:24.591 --> 00:12:26.272]  Hey lady, that's your political party.
[00:12:28.454 --> 00:12:29.715]  I'm going to show it later about time.
[00:12:29.935 --> 00:12:40.522]  It's just to experience the left to be Trump or like an Alex Jones or Tucker Carlson, what you experience is just unbelievable because you shake 50 hands.
[00:12:41.222 --> 00:12:44.104]  But that 50th person says, I'm going to kill you.
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.062]  So I have to walk around with security.
[00:12:48.303 --> 00:12:50.365]  If I want to go out, people say, well, just, you know, you shouldn't go out.
[00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:51.346]  You should just hide somewhere.
[00:12:51.386 --> 00:12:52.587]  No, I'm not hiding, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:52.627 --> 00:12:53.408]  We're the majority.
[00:12:53.428 --> 00:12:54.309]  Plus, we're in the right.
[00:12:54.349 --> 00:12:55.150]  We're not backing down.
[00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.391]  Now, let me stop right there.
[00:12:56.852 --> 00:12:58.994]  We're going to break in just a few minutes.
[00:13:00.115 --> 00:13:05.181]  And so when we come back, start your engines, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:07.743]  Start your engines.
[00:13:07.803 --> 00:13:08.184]  Because
[00:13:10.337 --> 00:13:18.921]  The information that's coming on Epstein is more ham-fisted, more insane, more over-the-top, more crazy than I could even believe.
[00:13:20.102 --> 00:13:23.203]  CBS News is reporting exactly what you'd expect.
[00:13:25.404 --> 00:13:28.506]  The inmates next door heard him shrieking, basically, and begging.
[00:13:29.106 --> 00:13:37.630]  And the guards, one who didn't work there, brought in separately, suddenly that day, with the lights turned off, cameras turned off,
[00:13:38.433 --> 00:13:39.954]  And the other guards told him to go home early.
[00:13:39.994 --> 00:13:40.834]  This is all confirmed.
[00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:47.038]  And as they go in, he begins screaming and they say, oh, breathe, breathe, fight for your life.
[00:13:47.698 --> 00:13:49.499]  And I agree with Tim Poole and his analysis.
[00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:54.762]  Because when I read Paul's headline about screeching and yelling and them saying, breathe, breathe, I thought, oh, that's them strangling him.
[00:13:54.782 --> 00:13:56.202]  And he's saying, breathe, breathe.
[00:13:57.083 --> 00:14:01.345]  Well, then Tim Poole, as I read the articles, like being quoted, so you could just, I mean, this is just standard.
[00:14:01.894 --> 00:14:04.196]  You're not choking yourself screaming and yelling, okay?
[00:14:04.517 --> 00:14:06.098]  And then people run in and say, oh, breathe, breathe.
[00:14:06.118 --> 00:14:07.059]  That's not even procedure.
[00:14:07.359 --> 00:14:09.521]  You just check the neck and try to breathe in their mouth or whatever.
[00:14:10.803 --> 00:14:11.643]  Okay, maybe.
[00:14:12.044 --> 00:14:20.412]  All these weird coincidences have happened all lined up and it's right after the documents come out and all the procedures and default positions are turned off.
[00:14:21.539 --> 00:14:22.879]  He's taking off suicide watch.
[00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:23.680]  He's putting a room alone.
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.540]  They're not supposed to do.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.081]  You can't kill yourself with the sheets because they're too thin.
[00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:28.461]  They're like paper on and on and on.
[00:14:28.581 --> 00:14:31.742]  And then magically the jail guards brought in that didn't even work there.
[00:14:32.223 --> 00:14:36.664]  And then they go in and then they tell the other guards go and don't do the 30 minute checks.
[00:14:37.004 --> 00:14:40.345]  And then all of a sudden, Oh, breathe, breathe.
[00:14:40.966 --> 00:14:42.106]  And then he's taken out and he's dead.
[00:14:43.326 --> 00:14:43.987]  Pretty amazing.
[00:14:44.027 --> 00:14:45.467]  I'm going to cover it all when we come back from break.
[00:14:45.507 --> 00:14:47.868]  But remember, we can't finance this operation.
[00:14:49.125 --> 00:14:58.807]  If it isn't for you, and we're changing the world right now, I cannot tell you the people that have called me, the support I've gotten, the apologies I've gotten on Twitter, on Facebook, in phone calls.
[00:14:59.267 --> 00:15:00.727]  A lot of famous people have called me.
[00:15:01.127 --> 00:15:07.188]  A lot of famous, well-known people even on the left, I guess who have a soul, have come out and said, okay, we apologize to Alex Jones.
[00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:09.029]  We've got to really find out what's going on.
[00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:11.889]  Because they know all the pedophilia is coming out.
[00:15:12.169 --> 00:15:14.970]  And the pedophilia rings mainly run by the Democrats.
[00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.911]  A lot of Republicans are going to be involved as well, but it's run by the Democrats.
[00:15:18.931 --> 00:15:21.732]  They're the right arm of the globalists, okay?
[00:15:22.272 --> 00:15:23.992]  And they know what they're doing.
[00:15:24.152 --> 00:15:27.293]  And people are now separating themselves from it, as they should.
[00:15:27.313 --> 00:15:31.554]  They're making the decision to say, okay, you've been right about a lot of stuff way ahead of time.
[00:15:32.215 --> 00:15:33.135]  We just couldn't believe it.
[00:15:33.335 --> 00:15:34.455]  We want to be separated.
[00:15:34.515 --> 00:15:35.115]  But here's the difference.
[00:15:37.156 --> 00:15:41.137]  I'm seeing tweets everywhere where people are saying,
[00:15:41.918 --> 00:15:46.580]  Oh, I hope the Clinton death count includes Trump soon, and we're glad that the Clintons are tough.
[00:15:47.021 --> 00:15:50.763]  I heard that on the airplane flying to San Diego when it was first announced Epstein was dead.
[00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.764]  A lot of these people know what's going on.
[00:15:53.084 --> 00:15:54.124]  They like the pedophilia.
[00:15:54.164 --> 00:15:54.925]  They like the evil.
[00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:57.246]  The leftists are so twisted, they think it's cool.
[00:15:57.746 --> 00:15:59.787]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:15:59.967 --> 00:16:00.588]  Spread those links.
[00:16:00.628 --> 00:16:01.328]  Defeat the enemy.
[00:16:01.348 --> 00:16:01.788]  Stay with us.
[00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:11.273]  Ladies and gentlemen, World War IV is upon us.
[00:16:15.998 --> 00:16:16.858]  It's a proxy war.
[00:16:17.078 --> 00:16:18.039]  It's regional wars.
[00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:19.339]  It's a culture war.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.261]  I'm gonna just give you a brief gestalt lay history.
[00:16:22.361 --> 00:16:27.903]  Anybody can go research this for yourself about how Trump is launching, via India, a proxy war.
[00:16:28.003 --> 00:16:31.645]  So to understand what Trump's doing, we have to understand the history of it.
[00:16:31.945 --> 00:16:33.566]  1,400 years ago, Muhammad...
[00:16:34.546 --> 00:16:35.146]  It's right here.
[00:16:35.346 --> 00:16:46.411]  He takes over the key crossroads of the caravans coming out of the empire of India that stretched all the way over to Iran and all the way into China.
[00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:50.152]  India was the dominant force, not China, not Japan at that time.
[00:16:50.192 --> 00:16:53.754]  They were the most powerful empire in the East and were expanding trade.
[00:16:53.774 --> 00:16:55.274]  So that's what's happening in India.
[00:16:55.354 --> 00:17:03.638]  Within just a few hundred years of Muhammad's death, they have already taken over what's Pakistan today, pushed the Indian empire back, taken over and surrounded India.
[00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:08.110]  You have Kashmir that is the birthplace of the Indian culture.
[00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:09.190]  Instead of India.
[00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.031]  Folks flooded in from all over the world because there was so much prosperity in that area.
[00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:13.491]  So, all of that's going on.
[00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:14.452]  That's just some of the background.
[00:17:14.572 --> 00:17:16.112]  So, China is over here.
[00:17:16.392 --> 00:17:17.833]  They're starting to go into Hong Kong.
[00:17:17.853 --> 00:17:18.853]  They're starting to go into Taiwan.
[00:17:19.273 --> 00:17:20.533]  They're threatening Japan.
[00:17:20.613 --> 00:17:22.854]  They're building islands all over the place.
[00:17:22.934 --> 00:17:24.515]  Way down here, even by the Philippines.
[00:17:24.615 --> 00:17:25.875]  Philippines is having to threaten them now.
[00:17:26.015 --> 00:17:29.218]  They're sending in their companies that are really paramilitary and others.
[00:17:29.338 --> 00:17:30.520]  They're taking over the colleges.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.141]  They're buying everybody off just like they're doing here.
[00:17:32.161 --> 00:17:33.062]  They're buying off the media.
[00:17:33.102 --> 00:17:40.870]  They're using all this incredible money they've been given by us, giving trade superiority of $900 billion a year for decades, to be able to just take over the planet.
[00:17:41.151 --> 00:17:42.672]  Again, they were given $98 billion.
[00:17:43.593 --> 00:17:44.474]  percent of rare minerals.
[00:17:44.494 --> 00:17:45.875]  You just don't get that.
[00:17:46.175 --> 00:17:48.097]  No one else is allowed by the globalists to operate.
[00:17:48.137 --> 00:17:48.717]  They sue you.
[00:17:48.797 --> 00:17:49.758]  The UN comes after you.
[00:17:49.898 --> 00:17:52.720]  China is able to do human clones, take people's organs.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.941]  They just do whatever the hell they want.
[00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:57.304]  They're God, basically, because they're an evil Qaikom force feeding on their own people.
[00:17:57.324 --> 00:17:59.806]  They're the model of the global technocracy the NWO wants.
[00:17:59.966 --> 00:18:03.349]  So Trump and Japan and South Korea and others form an alliance.
[00:18:03.369 --> 00:18:06.491]  As soon as Trump gets elected, he says this new order is a screwjob for everybody.
[00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:08.693]  We're not going along with it, including the Chinese people.
[00:18:08.933 --> 00:18:09.534]  They don't like it.
[00:18:09.634 --> 00:18:09.954]  Eat meat.
[00:18:10.194 --> 00:18:13.077]  With the leader of India, he hugs him.
[00:18:13.177 --> 00:18:16.459]  He says, hey, if China gives you problems, and keeps trying to take over Kashmir.
[00:18:16.539 --> 00:18:23.385]  Then at 49, the UN made India create an autonomous zone, which then now China has come in and openly taken over about a third of the country.
[00:18:23.405 --> 00:18:28.789]  The Islamists are pouring in, now pushing to the new borders of India and trying to take India proper over itself.
[00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:31.632]  And again, leftist media calls it Indian extremism.
[00:18:32.012 --> 00:18:33.613]  They call him a Hindu extremist.
[00:18:34.033 --> 00:18:37.116]  Even though the Pakistanis were Indians until the Islamists took it up.
[00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:39.317]  There's Hindu and Buddhist temples all over Pakistan.
[00:18:39.357 --> 00:18:39.917]  Well, there were.
[00:18:40.037 --> 00:18:41.078]  The Muslims blew them all up.
[00:18:41.178 --> 00:18:42.779]  So, all of this is happening.
[00:18:43.019 --> 00:18:44.120]  All of this is going on.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.661]  And then once they take your country over, they remove any symbols you ever existed.
[00:18:47.681 --> 00:18:48.962]  They erase that they were Indians.
[00:18:49.382 --> 00:18:53.604]  So, you've got China bordering right here in what is Kashmir.
[00:18:53.945 --> 00:18:56.206]  And so, Trump green-lighted, go ahead.
[00:18:56.226 --> 00:18:57.827]  You're not under that UN thing anymore.
[00:18:57.987 --> 00:18:58.407]  Go in.
[00:18:58.567 --> 00:19:03.770]  Within hours of what happened with the currency devaluation, within hours, they sent the troops in.
[00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:04.650]  The Indians did it.
[00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.812]  And I want to be clear, India didn't invade Kashmir.
[00:19:07.832 --> 00:19:14.436]  Kashmir was stolen from it when the British Empire was dissolving and becoming the New World Order, because India never really got its freedom.
[00:19:14.556 --> 00:19:18.738]  Under their current leader, India is, to a certain extent, actually becoming independent, finally.
[00:19:19.018 --> 00:19:25.682]  So, you got China right here, and this is the key piece in the whole chessboard, is this whole fight going on over India.
[00:19:25.922 --> 00:19:32.404]  Because you'll control the trade routes, you'll control the water, you'll control everything into Burma and Thailand and Vietnam and the Philippines.
[00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:33.984]  You've all had wars with China.
[00:19:34.124 --> 00:19:37.325]  China is completely expansionist, completely out of control.
[00:19:37.485 --> 00:19:42.966]  And so Trump has turned the Indians loose to be on their flank and to let China know you're now in a vice grip.
[00:19:43.086 --> 00:19:45.407]  And this is the stuff that World War 4 is made of.
[00:19:45.687 --> 00:19:46.827]  This is the real deal.
[00:19:46.867 --> 00:19:50.308]  Doesn't mean nuclear missiles, doesn't mean huge explosions, even though both sides are nuclear powers.
[00:19:50.948 --> 00:19:51.649]  India and Pakistan.
[00:19:51.969 --> 00:19:57.957]  It means Trump's taking the gloves off, he's for real, this is really happening, and the House of World Government is dead!
[00:20:06.387 --> 00:20:09.030]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.425 --> 00:20:17.125]  Big Brother.
[00:20:18.106 --> 00:20:19.367]  Mainstream media.
[00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:21.608]  Government cover-ups.
[00:20:22.228 --> 00:20:23.649]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.591]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:26.451 --> 00:20:31.154]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:38.726 --> 00:20:40.627]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:20:40.727 --> 00:20:47.409]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday, August 13th, 2019 Global Broadcast.
[00:20:47.489 --> 00:20:49.410]  Owen Schroer riding shotgun with me.
[00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.531]  He'll be popping in some of this segment and next segment.
[00:20:52.571 --> 00:21:01.715]  Now, I'm hyperventilating because there's so much incredible news, so many amazing things taking place all around us.
[00:21:01.795 --> 00:21:03.075]  It's just an amazing world.
[00:21:03.315 --> 00:21:05.196]  So I'm sitting here, I'm watching an aircraft carrier
[00:21:07.403 --> 00:21:11.544]  Amazing scene to watch this floating city right out the window here in San Diego.
[00:21:11.924 --> 00:21:31.247]  But continuing, Trump comes out with this leak, which is designed on purpose to let the left know they're serious yesterday, that the FCC is going to come in and look at the censorship happening at big tech companies and treat them like a public utility or telecom, which is constitutional.
[00:21:32.188 --> 00:21:34.388]  They're going to stop them prohibiting content.
[00:21:35.017 --> 00:21:36.779]  That's not barred by FCC.
[00:21:36.819 --> 00:21:38.040]  That would be pornography.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.781]  That would be illegal porn.
[00:21:40.642 --> 00:21:42.223]  That would be illegal gambling ads.
[00:21:42.323 --> 00:21:43.564]  That would be hacking ads.
[00:21:44.405 --> 00:21:49.709]  That would be calls to violence or cuss words, which they're going to have rules saying you can't cuss obviously on the Internet.
[00:21:49.869 --> 00:21:50.730]  And I don't even like that.
[00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:56.455]  But the Internet has become the public square and Google
[00:21:57.338 --> 00:22:01.899]  And Apple and others have gone under authoritarian rules and are already acting as governments.
[00:22:02.399 --> 00:22:05.820]  So the First Amendment is a law stating you can't prohibit something.
[00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:11.362]  So Trump is saying we're going to have a law prohibiting under the First Amendment that you can't take rights.
[00:22:11.902 --> 00:22:16.844]  Still dangerous, but it's our government, it's our country, and it's against big tech censorship.
[00:22:17.064 --> 00:22:18.404]  But that's only part of the executive order.
[00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:36.908]  Trump continues and says that really it's going to be the Federal Trade Commission will have an open complaint system and criminal investigations and civil lawsuits both over the racketeering, over the bullying, over the voter suppression.
[00:22:37.168 --> 00:22:39.050]  And that's exactly what we needed.
[00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:40.972]  That's only part of what's on the table.
[00:22:41.937 --> 00:22:47.878]  In the drafts, there's taking government funding away through government grants that Google, Apple, Twitter and others get billions in.
[00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:55.100]  There's removing them off military bases and government installations saying they're working with China so that they can't be trusted like Huawei.
[00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:58.061]  This is all a very exciting time.
[00:22:58.121 --> 00:23:04.303]  And notice suddenly, I'll talk about next segment with the gentleman who exposed all of this.
[00:23:04.823 --> 00:23:07.783]  Chris Cuomo blew up at that's the point with Brandon.
[00:23:08.063 --> 00:23:08.884]  That's the host name.
[00:23:09.484 --> 00:23:10.144]  That's the name of the show.
[00:23:15.438 --> 00:23:15.858]  Viral.
[00:23:16.959 --> 00:23:23.182]  But then the President's son said something and others pointed it out and they put it back up.
[00:23:23.622 --> 00:23:27.684]  So see, oh, you show Chris Cuomo in public threatening to physically attack somebody.
[00:23:28.965 --> 00:23:29.966]  YouTube took it down.
[00:23:31.046 --> 00:23:33.127]  But as soon as they got backlash, they put it back up.
[00:23:33.327 --> 00:23:35.389]  They're not as arrogant as they used to be.
[00:23:35.629 --> 00:23:41.852]  Now, let's get to the big enchilada that we'll obviously cover with Mark Randazza, the lawyer who got these documents last week.
[00:23:42.312 --> 00:23:43.793]  That's big developments on that front.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.441]  We're also going to have Bob Barms joining us.
[00:23:47.561 --> 00:23:49.541]  Ho-Tep Jesus, always informative.
[00:23:49.821 --> 00:23:52.682]  Going to be coming on again and Owen Schroer riding shotgun.
[00:23:53.943 --> 00:23:59.664]  But this next news is so big that I think, should I start the show with it?
[00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:00.105]  No.
[00:24:00.665 --> 00:24:02.525]  China basically being at war with the U.S.
[00:24:02.986 --> 00:24:04.226]  and proxy wars is bigger.
[00:24:04.466 --> 00:24:07.847]  And Trump getting ready to move against censorship in general is huge.
[00:24:08.387 --> 00:24:14.169]  But the way this Epstein case captured the public's mind and was like Toto pulling back the curtain.
[00:24:14.847 --> 00:24:17.629]  In the Wizard of Oz, showing the little man behind the curtain.
[00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:21.691]  It probably is bigger than everything because it symbolizes the awakening.
[00:24:22.152 --> 00:24:29.316]  One scumbag pimp that procured underage people and children and for rituals and other evil things to compromise folks.
[00:24:29.756 --> 00:24:34.179]  Yeah, he's not the news, but the fact that the media has tried to cover this up and tried to defend it.
[00:24:34.379 --> 00:24:37.141]  The fact that they're censoring on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube right now.
[00:24:37.161 --> 00:24:43.785]  Any mention of this or who's in the 2,000 pages of documents, all these top Democrats and others.
[00:24:44.693 --> 00:24:46.494]  And all the royalty and all the corporate heads.
[00:24:47.034 --> 00:24:48.274]  And this is just a few witnesses.
[00:24:48.774 --> 00:24:49.895]  This is all coming out.
[00:24:49.955 --> 00:24:51.775]  And the witnesses match up with flight logs.
[00:24:52.435 --> 00:24:53.136]  So, what happened?
[00:24:54.356 --> 00:24:56.297]  Oh, people said, oh, it's the Witness Protection Program.
[00:24:56.417 --> 00:24:57.437]  Well, I don't agree with that.
[00:24:57.517 --> 00:24:58.897]  Dead men don't tell tales.
[00:24:59.318 --> 00:25:00.818]  And they want to threaten the other witnesses.
[00:25:00.878 --> 00:25:05.880]  So, they famously have always had jail guards that for money will do whatever they're told.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.521]  And whether it was jail guards that were in there before or jail guards that came in later, we don't know their names yet.
[00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:13.802]  CBS News is reporting
[00:25:14.952 --> 00:25:20.920]  That they heard yelling and shrieking as soon as two guards go in, one of them who didn't even work there.
[00:25:21.601 --> 00:25:24.846]  They're like, hey, we got Bob, but we need probably a two-man team.
[00:25:25.126 --> 00:25:26.488]  What if the Sebstein can fight?
[00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:29.612]  Eh, we'll bring Charlie in, or whatever his name is.
[00:25:30.153 --> 00:25:31.976]  And as I was reading Paul Watson's article about this,
[00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:35.671]  Before I even got into it, I said, oh, that's a classic cover.
[00:25:35.871 --> 00:25:38.072]  Boom, open the door, run in, you hear some shrieking.
[00:25:38.332 --> 00:25:39.492]  And she, oh, breathe!
[00:25:39.712 --> 00:25:41.113]  Fight for your life, pal!
[00:25:41.513 --> 00:25:43.474]  Oh, you plum on Epstein, fight!
[00:25:43.514 --> 00:25:45.094]  Well, you got him in that choke hold.
[00:25:45.815 --> 00:25:48.516]  Oh, lights out, pal!
[00:25:49.916 --> 00:25:50.737]  Then they leave.
[00:25:52.637 --> 00:25:53.317]  This is incredible.
[00:25:53.358 --> 00:25:54.538]  CBS News is reporting.
[00:25:55.481 --> 00:26:01.767]  That inmates are telling federal investigators, no, we heard the door open, screaming, yelling, begging, basically.
[00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:06.191]  And then right as that starts, oh, come on Epstein, breathe, buddy.
[00:26:06.451 --> 00:26:07.332]  You can do it.
[00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:10.715]  That's exactly how you do this when you know people are listening.
[00:26:11.116 --> 00:26:11.976]  And that's textbook.
[00:26:11.996 --> 00:26:20.124]  So before I even read what Tim Poole was saying, investigative journalist, I have a lot of respect for, even though he goes with the stereotypes of me and, you know, doesn't ever give me credit.
[00:26:20.144 --> 00:26:20.484]  That's fine.
[00:26:20.524 --> 00:26:21.165]  He does great work.
[00:26:22.395 --> 00:26:25.557]  Shrieking and shouting heard from Epstein's cell the morning he died.
[00:26:25.937 --> 00:26:28.778]  Guard on duty was not a regular corrections officer.
[00:26:29.859 --> 00:26:31.159]  And they turned the cameras off.
[00:26:31.359 --> 00:26:32.540]  And they turned the lights off.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.961]  And they told the other guards to go home 30 minutes early.
[00:26:35.281 --> 00:26:41.944]  I mean, this is... Every default position was click, click, click, click, click, click, turned off just as...
[00:26:43.391 --> 00:26:46.334]  Uh, Robert Barnes was saying yesterday, but one thing he forgot.
[00:26:46.354 --> 00:26:48.636]  This is also a super high-profile guy.
[00:26:48.656 --> 00:26:52.880]  Everybody's saying they're gonna kill right after all these bombshell documents come out.
[00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:56.423]  Oh, you don't think British royalty would have somebody killed.
[00:26:56.443 --> 00:27:00.967]  You don't think they can find jail guards that for ten million dollars would do this when they know they're protected?
[00:27:01.127 --> 00:27:03.529]  I'm sure CBS and Tim Pool are wrong.
[00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.271]  They didn't do nothing.
[00:27:05.711 --> 00:27:06.592]  They're nice boys.
[00:27:07.899 --> 00:27:11.141]  Shrieking and shouting was heard from Jeffrey Epstein's cell in the morning.
[00:27:11.702 --> 00:27:16.505]  He died while one of Epstein's guards at the Metropolitan Police Center was not a regular corrections officer.
[00:27:16.525 --> 00:27:20.008]  On the morning of Epstein's
[00:27:28.002 --> 00:27:31.023]  There was shouting and shrieking from his cell, reports CBS News.
[00:27:31.303 --> 00:27:36.584]  Corrections officers attempted to revive him while saying, breathe, breathe, Epstein, breathe.
[00:27:37.144 --> 00:27:38.404]  Like shoving your head in water.
[00:27:38.684 --> 00:27:39.944]  Breathe there, buddy.
[00:27:40.265 --> 00:27:42.025]  Oh, don't bleed to death while they stab you.
[00:27:43.265 --> 00:27:43.845]  Don't die.
[00:27:43.925 --> 00:27:44.285]  Boom.
[00:27:44.425 --> 00:27:45.446]  Oh, how'd that feel?
[00:27:47.106 --> 00:27:57.388]  Continuing, journalist Tim Poole even speculated that breathe, breathe could be shouted as cover for those same individuals acting and actually murdering Epstein.
[00:27:58.184 --> 00:27:59.946]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:28:00.547 --> 00:28:06.954]  I'm imagining two guys standing and strangling Epstein while leaning out so that other inmates can hear them.
[00:28:07.074 --> 00:28:07.574]  Breathe.
[00:28:07.815 --> 00:28:08.736]  Oh, no.
[00:28:09.256 --> 00:28:10.317]  He's choking.
[00:28:10.417 --> 00:28:11.318]  Breathe.
[00:28:11.799 --> 00:28:15.543]  And they're strangling him in a sleeper hole, said Poole.
[00:28:16.985 --> 00:28:17.725]  And it goes on from there.
[00:28:17.926 --> 00:28:19.948]  This is CBS News reporting this.
[00:28:22.059 --> 00:28:23.741]  All the systems are turned off.
[00:28:23.861 --> 00:28:25.062]  All the regulars are sent home.
[00:28:25.442 --> 00:28:27.064]  The regular check-in every 30 minutes.
[00:28:27.184 --> 00:28:28.045]  Oh, don't do that.
[00:28:28.786 --> 00:28:35.152]  Again, this is the most ridiculous, over-the-top thing I have ever seen.
[00:28:35.312 --> 00:28:36.373]  It makes my head spin.
[00:28:36.433 --> 00:28:39.116]  And you've got to ask yourself, why are they so incredibly sloppy?
[00:28:39.436 --> 00:28:39.956]  It gets worse.
[00:28:39.976 --> 00:28:41.438]  And come back.
[00:28:42.244 --> 00:28:44.245]  Before we go to our guest, it's on Infowars.com.
[00:28:44.685 --> 00:28:47.026]  All that drone footage shot, show what was in his windows.
[00:28:47.546 --> 00:28:52.969]  Right before the FBI gets there, somebody cleans out all the computers and everything, and we have video of it.
[00:28:53.869 --> 00:28:54.309]  That's right.
[00:28:54.609 --> 00:28:56.430]  So who was on the island days before?
[00:28:57.211 --> 00:28:58.491]  Will the FBI ask that question?
[00:28:58.511 --> 00:29:01.012]  Or will people inside protect the Clintons again?
[00:29:01.032 --> 00:29:09.276]  When you finance what we're doing, you're not just funding the second American Revolution.
[00:29:10.663 --> 00:29:12.224]  You're changing world destiny.
[00:29:12.564 --> 00:29:17.127]  And there's so much fake stuff out there in a million different voices, and I understand that.
[00:29:17.187 --> 00:29:22.331]  But we really are in the zeitgeist, and we try to make it easy to get good products at the same time.
[00:29:22.411 --> 00:29:28.775]  But I can just tell you point blank, you cannot invest in a place better than InfoWars for human liberty and a pro-human future.
[00:29:28.835 --> 00:29:34.599]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[00:29:34.619 --> 00:29:37.081]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[00:29:37.281 --> 00:29:40.023]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil we have.
[00:29:40.103 --> 00:29:42.704]  Fish oil, children's fish oil, and ultimate krill oil.
[00:29:42.864 --> 00:29:43.984]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[00:29:44.364 --> 00:29:47.305]  And it is the strongest, purest fish oil, krill oil.
[00:29:47.385 --> 00:29:53.947]  And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[00:29:54.127 --> 00:29:59.849]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[00:29:59.889 --> 00:30:02.230]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:03.110]  This is not it.
[00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:09.712]  We went to one of the top firms in the world that private labels fish oil and krill oil, and we said, we want the best you make.
[00:30:09.972 --> 00:30:10.192]  Period.
[00:30:10.212 --> 00:30:11.755]  I want to show people this krill oil.
[00:30:11.855 --> 00:30:16.161]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere.
[00:30:16.301 --> 00:30:17.784]  This is thermonuclear right here.
[00:30:18.124 --> 00:30:18.705]  It's red.
[00:30:18.885 --> 00:30:20.928]  This is real krill oil, folks.
[00:30:20.988 --> 00:30:21.369]  It's red.
[00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:22.030]  It's not yellow.
[00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:23.231]  It's not milky.
[00:30:23.392 --> 00:30:24.934]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[00:30:25.074 --> 00:30:26.615]  And by the way, I'm not hyping this, folks.
[00:30:26.816 --> 00:30:29.778]  This is the best krill oil we could find.
[00:30:29.978 --> 00:30:30.779]  This is the best.
[00:30:30.859 --> 00:30:32.180]  I can't even just look at that.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.103]  It's supposed to be red, folks, because that's the essence of the krill.
[00:30:35.123 --> 00:30:37.785]  I mean, there's probably like a hundred krill going to each one of these.
[00:30:38.005 --> 00:30:41.488]  And again, I'm not going to call this a drug, because drugs are a ripoff of what God made.
[00:30:41.748 --> 00:30:44.231]  You take two of these before you go to bed at night.
[00:30:44.391 --> 00:30:46.412]  I would do it with your dinner if you don't want to get fish burps.
[00:30:46.432 --> 00:30:48.054]  Because again, I've got the fish oils of old.
[00:30:48.234 --> 00:30:50.797]  This doesn't have the fish flavor, because they boiled the hell out of it.
[00:30:50.817 --> 00:30:52.359]  It isn't there anymore, folks.
[00:30:52.459 --> 00:30:53.720]  You gotta deal with the fish burps.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.761]  This stuff's powerful.
[00:30:54.801 --> 00:30:55.562]  Just look at that.
[00:30:55.642 --> 00:30:57.805]  Can the camera pick up just how pretty those are?
[00:30:57.965 --> 00:30:59.486]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:04.503 --> 00:31:08.607]  Alex, I got a plug for the Patriot Points I get.
[00:31:08.627 --> 00:31:12.270]  I got $180 so far this year at Patriot Points and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[00:31:12.911 --> 00:31:15.974]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[00:31:16.034 --> 00:31:19.157]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in.
[00:31:19.257 --> 00:31:20.418]  So I'd rather give that money to
[00:31:20.518 --> 00:31:21.899]  Let me break this down for you.
[00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:23.181]  I've never really done marketing, but I did
[00:31:41.517 --> 00:31:45.859]  Bring in a few advertising people a few years ago who knew how to advertise online.
[00:31:45.899 --> 00:31:48.399]  And they said, Mr. Jones, they said, what's your markup?
[00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:50.980]  And I said, 150%, but we always discount 25%.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.201]  So that's 100%.
[00:31:52.241 --> 00:31:53.621]  And they said, yeah.
[00:31:53.761 --> 00:31:54.962]  And then you're always discounting 20, 30%.
[00:31:55.102 --> 00:31:57.803]  And then we notice you only sell stuff when it's at 50%.
[00:31:58.643 --> 00:32:00.104]  And then you're barely making any money.
[00:32:00.264 --> 00:32:01.425]  You need to stop that.
[00:32:01.525 --> 00:32:04.528]  And they looked at our data, and they said, oh, your audience would buy it if it was even more.
[00:32:04.548 --> 00:32:06.270]  And I said, I want high-quality stuff in there.
[00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:07.531]  I want a good price.
[00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:13.736]  But I've kind of habituated everybody, trained everybody, myself done this, to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[00:32:13.896 --> 00:32:15.477]  I'm making $2 on my toothpaste 50% off.
[00:32:16.118 --> 00:32:19.040]  Because there's no fillers, it's concentrated, it's got iodine, a little silver.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.722]  And so it's the same thing with like the fish oil, or the turmeric, or the bone broth.
[00:32:22.823 --> 00:32:26.445]  I mean, DNA Force, I signed a multi-year contract on that.
[00:32:26.485 --> 00:32:29.307]  So I was able to cut the price about 40% of what we were paying.
[00:32:29.427 --> 00:32:32.309]  It's still got 30-something dollars of product in it.
[00:32:32.449 --> 00:32:37.253]  I mean, you talk about cleaning your cells out, you talk about energy stamina, you talk about letting the telomeres last longer.
[00:32:37.373 --> 00:32:38.774]  This is patented to do that.
[00:32:38.954 --> 00:32:42.136]  And nobody puts this much of the real organic stuff in it.
[00:32:42.237 --> 00:32:44.118]  So yes, DNA Force is amazing.
[00:32:44.238 --> 00:32:45.179]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[00:32:45.219 --> 00:32:49.282]  But listen, when people get the Patriot Points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[00:32:49.402 --> 00:32:57.909]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, and then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot Points, we lose money.
[00:32:57.929 --> 00:32:58.529]  But that's okay.
[00:32:58.569 --> 00:32:59.190]  Thanks for the support.
[00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:22.638]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.239 --> 00:33:31.502]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.804 --> 00:33:43.946]  So we're going to go to the man of the hour who shot video recently, Chris Cuomo, the big bully with no ratings on CNN.
[00:33:44.326 --> 00:33:46.167]  This gentleman's been a guest on the broadcast before.
[00:33:46.507 --> 00:33:47.727]  He does a great job.
[00:33:48.207 --> 00:33:49.748]  We're going to be talking to him.
[00:33:50.148 --> 00:33:51.928]  It's That's The Point with Brandon.
[00:33:53.248 --> 00:33:56.409]  He's obviously a big guy because Cuomo's a big guy, but this guy's a big guy.
[00:33:56.889 --> 00:34:01.670]  Talk about total posturing by Fredo Cuomo, as he's now known.
[00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:02.671]  That's coming up.
[00:34:02.771 --> 00:34:03.731]  Let me just finish up with this.
[00:34:04.739 --> 00:34:16.107]  Right-centered dead panel on DrudgeReport.com is the FBI scrambles after drone footage of little pedophile island, little St.
[00:34:16.247 --> 00:34:29.916]  Pito, Jeffrey Epstein, shows that days before the FBI raids it, through the windows you see Apple computers, you see hard drives, you see wiring, you see equipment.
[00:34:30.757 --> 00:34:32.778]  It's all been expunged.
[00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.831]  It's all been scraped.
[00:34:35.512 --> 00:34:36.973]  It's all been taken out.
[00:34:37.613 --> 00:34:38.854]  It's all disappeared.
[00:34:39.254 --> 00:34:41.316]  So the FBI's out there snorkeling around.
[00:34:41.336 --> 00:34:41.997]  They're looking for everything.
[00:34:42.017 --> 00:34:43.458]  And look, most of the FBI's good.
[00:34:43.978 --> 00:34:46.100]  But the regular FBI gets sent on to look for it.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:51.844]  The people inside the Justice Department, they know the raid that everybody's been asking for for 10 years.
[00:34:51.884 --> 00:34:52.705]  I've been saying raid.
[00:34:53.966 --> 00:34:56.468]  Both that island and the bigger island he owned right next door.
[00:34:57.048 --> 00:34:59.490]  The reported tunnels, the dungeons that are all confirmed now.
[00:35:00.638 --> 00:35:01.799]  They didn't just fly kids in.
[00:35:02.179 --> 00:35:04.461]  They had smugglers bring kidnapped kids up in boats.
[00:35:05.082 --> 00:35:06.943]  That's been in the local news for five years.
[00:35:07.423 --> 00:35:09.085]  The people say, that's just Devil's Island.
[00:35:09.365 --> 00:35:10.366]  That's just Pipo Island.
[00:35:11.247 --> 00:35:13.869]  The mayors and stuff are like, we need help.
[00:35:13.889 --> 00:35:15.610]  They hurt the children on the island.
[00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:17.492]  We do not let our children go out at night.
[00:35:17.512 --> 00:35:18.372]  They take them there.
[00:35:18.392 --> 00:35:19.593]  The children disappear.
[00:35:20.014 --> 00:35:22.095]  It's like Dracula's castle.
[00:35:22.415 --> 00:35:23.316]  You don't go out at night.
[00:35:23.336 --> 00:35:24.037]  You don't get near it.
[00:35:24.517 --> 00:35:28.020]  Those are thousand-year-old legends, and now you see it again.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.762]  And it was in the news out of Italy.
[00:35:29.822 --> 00:35:30.462]  Major news.
[00:35:30.843 --> 00:35:34.986]  An island where they take children and others and have orgies and kill them.
[00:35:36.408 --> 00:35:37.989]  And there's now indictments happening.
[00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.993]  I know that sounds scary, but legends all come out of real things.
[00:35:44.615 --> 00:35:46.877]  Just type in human sacrifice in history.
[00:35:47.017 --> 00:35:47.858]  Every culture did it.
[00:35:48.689 --> 00:35:55.031]  From the ancient Asians, to the ancient Africans, to the Mesoamericans, to all the Germanic tribes of human sacrifice.
[00:35:55.411 --> 00:35:56.872]  And the left always tried to cover that up.
[00:35:56.952 --> 00:35:57.212]  Why?
[00:35:57.232 --> 00:35:59.632]  Because they didn't want you to know it's ongoing.
[00:36:00.013 --> 00:36:01.473]  Things like Wicker Man.
[00:36:02.073 --> 00:36:03.474]  All of that's real, folks.
[00:36:04.554 --> 00:36:06.094]  Sometimes they want to kill the king.
[00:36:06.395 --> 00:36:09.976]  If things got really bad, they'd kill the king in a Wicker Man.
[00:36:10.256 --> 00:36:11.296]  That's a druidic thing.
[00:36:11.736 --> 00:36:12.416]  A Gaelic thing.
[00:36:12.917 --> 00:36:15.297]  Sometimes you'd kill his son if you really needed strength.
[00:36:16.018 --> 00:36:17.178]  I mean, the druids would demand.
[00:36:17.754 --> 00:36:19.696]  You know, the king's son or the king's daughter.
[00:36:19.736 --> 00:36:22.718]  They didn't just... The Aztecs sometimes would demand royalty be killed.
[00:36:23.339 --> 00:36:25.340]  So, everybody does this stuff.
[00:36:25.981 --> 00:36:29.324]  Everybody repeats this stuff and it's a real deal.
[00:36:30.645 --> 00:36:38.692]  So, be sure to check out that article by Jamie White on DrudgeReport.com and realize we are overpowering the censors.
[00:36:38.832 --> 00:36:41.354]  Google and Twitter and Facebook, shame on them.
[00:36:41.454 --> 00:36:42.735]  Even mainline journalists.
[00:36:43.587 --> 00:36:52.153]  That are talking about this or talking about the names on the 2000 pages that is public that a federal judge ordered released to Mark Randazzo, who's an InfoWars lawyer.
[00:36:53.034 --> 00:36:53.974]  He's coming on next hour.
[00:36:55.215 --> 00:36:56.596]  Thanks to him and the work of Mike Cernovich.
[00:36:58.738 --> 00:37:01.299]  They are removing it and blocking it all over the place.
[00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:02.440]  There's articles everywhere about it.
[00:37:02.821 --> 00:37:07.584]  You think about signing on to evil folks and aiding and abetting and making themselves part of it now.
[00:37:08.775 --> 00:37:10.276]  Let's shift gears and cut right there.
[00:37:10.316 --> 00:37:16.682]  We're live, but we put these up on our own servers and fullwords.com, so you can find the audio, find the video, and share these.
[00:37:17.302 --> 00:37:18.063]  That's really the key.
[00:37:18.103 --> 00:37:19.544]  You know what's going on, listeners and viewers.
[00:37:20.124 --> 00:37:21.185]  You're the eyes and ears of this thing.
[00:37:21.245 --> 00:37:22.066]  You're the muscle.
[00:37:22.086 --> 00:37:23.287]  We've got to get the videos and send them.
[00:37:23.527 --> 00:37:27.170]  We'll have the last two segments cut together with all this proof.
[00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:32.154]  But let's, for this segment, the next, and that first little five minutes, go to our very special guest.
[00:37:33.776 --> 00:37:36.398]  The show is the... That's the point.
[00:37:36.949 --> 00:37:43.214]  The show is, That's The Point with Brandon, and he's going to tell us where he was, the details, the background.
[00:37:44.135 --> 00:37:45.816]  But this is one of the biggest stories in the country.
[00:37:45.876 --> 00:37:47.717]  It's top-linked on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:37:48.718 --> 00:37:52.081]  At first, we now know that it was taken down by YouTube until there was a backlash.
[00:37:52.101 --> 00:37:55.823]  Now the president, now his son, have retweeted it.
[00:37:56.344 --> 00:37:58.385]  It's getting tens of millions of views across the internet.
[00:37:58.826 --> 00:38:05.631]  Where Mr. Cuomo, Chris Cuomo of CNN non-fame, almost no viewers, terrible ratings,
[00:38:07.142 --> 00:38:10.884]  Bullies and attacks this man for calling him Fredo.
[00:38:11.104 --> 00:38:21.009]  Now, that's a thing that I have a lot of Italian friends, a lot of Italian friends, a lot of Italian great folks that work for the office and business partners and people, they all call weak men Fredos.
[00:38:22.129 --> 00:38:25.431]  And so I guess that's why the godfather they call their son Fredo.
[00:38:25.931 --> 00:38:31.214]  I'm told that was going on before the godfather that you call somebody Fredo.
[00:38:31.892 --> 00:38:34.693]  Mark Rondazza is an Italian citizen as well as a U.S.
[00:38:34.713 --> 00:38:35.133]  citizen.
[00:38:35.993 --> 00:38:43.035]  He started an Italian school, so he's a big, I guess you'd say, Romophile, supporter of Italian stuff.
[00:38:43.756 --> 00:38:47.997]  And he's going to pop in to Next Hour and point out, no, no, that's not the N-word, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:48.657 --> 00:38:50.098]  It's saying you're weak.
[00:38:50.598 --> 00:38:51.598]  It's saying you're a fake.
[00:38:51.958 --> 00:39:00.821]  And if anybody deserves to be called Chris Fredo Cuomo, it's him and his thug brother, Andrew, that said America was never great.
[00:39:01.573 --> 00:39:02.394]  And it'll never be great.
[00:39:02.974 --> 00:39:04.256]  Or no, it was never that great.
[00:39:04.716 --> 00:39:05.477]  It'll never be great.
[00:39:06.098 --> 00:39:08.280]  I mean, if that didn't... I mean, Fredo means punk.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.521]  Fredo means bitch.
[00:39:09.801 --> 00:39:10.842]  Fredo means enemy.
[00:39:11.002 --> 00:39:13.625]  Fredo means somebody you don't want watching your back.
[00:39:14.146 --> 00:39:15.607]  Fredo means somebody you can't trust.
[00:39:15.847 --> 00:39:17.229]  It doesn't mean the damn N-word.
[00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:23.395]  But imagine this big, rich, powerful guy that got away with hit-and-runs and his corrupt thug brother and all of this.
[00:39:24.656 --> 00:39:25.477]  He has the nerve.
[00:39:26.405 --> 00:39:32.068]  To sit there and tell somebody that, oh, you've called me the N-word so you can flip out and threaten to throw him downstairs and basically kill him.
[00:39:32.509 --> 00:39:33.329]  I'll wreck you.
[00:39:33.409 --> 00:39:34.370]  I'll throw you downstairs.
[00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:42.275]  We're going to play the beeped audio next segment, but let's bring in the host of That's The Point with our guest, Brandon.
[00:39:42.295 --> 00:39:43.595]  Thank you so much for coming on, sir.
[00:39:44.816 --> 00:39:45.256]  Oh, Alex.
[00:39:45.857 --> 00:39:47.498]  You know, it's a pleasure every time.
[00:39:49.279 --> 00:39:50.700]  You know, you broke my heart, Fredo.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.741]  You, you broke my heart.
[00:39:53.892 --> 00:39:59.274]  And uh, so the whole thing was this video was actually sent to me.
[00:39:59.294 --> 00:40:00.595]  I wasn't there.
[00:40:01.435 --> 00:40:10.399]  Uh, so the video was sent to me by a, uh, that's the point, uh, follower and they gave, they say, Hey, I don't want to be named.
[00:40:10.759 --> 00:40:13.760]  I just want you to expose what he did and this and this and that.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:21.943]  So the story is dude was at a, going at a bar and, um, Chris Coleman was there with a woman and a group of other guys.
[00:40:22.444 --> 00:40:23.104]  And I guess they were,
[00:40:23.949 --> 00:40:28.291]  One was going up the stairs and one was coming down the stairs, and they kind of met right by the stairs.
[00:40:28.771 --> 00:40:37.874]  And this guy who chooses to remain anonymous, he asked him, he said, hey, Fredo, can I get a photo?
[00:40:38.094 --> 00:40:42.815]  And the reason he called him Fredo was because he listens, the guy listens to Rush Limbaugh all the time.
[00:40:43.236 --> 00:40:47.937]  And Rush Limbaugh always equates calling him Fredo, Chris Como Fredo.
[00:40:48.377 --> 00:40:53.059]  So he legitimately, this is what I was told, and he legitimately believed
[00:40:53.971 --> 00:40:54.051]  Wow!
[00:41:05.103 --> 00:41:12.085]  Yeah, so, and then clearly in the video you could see, like I said, hey, look, I didn't mean it like that.
[00:41:13.485 --> 00:41:17.906]  I legitimately thought your name was... That's, okay, so I thought that was you.
[00:41:17.926 --> 00:41:21.587]  I know you've been on the show a few times, but we were moving quick here and there wasn't a lot of detail with the video.
[00:41:21.607 --> 00:41:22.167]  That's why you're here.
[00:41:22.187 --> 00:41:24.408]  I'm glad we're getting the background because the guy's big.
[00:41:24.448 --> 00:41:28.369]  I mean, I know Cuomo's a really big guy, but this guy looks even bigger and he seems
[00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:30.871]  He seems so genuine saying, Hey man, I'm sorry.
[00:41:31.452 --> 00:41:32.212]  I didn't know.
[00:41:32.653 --> 00:41:36.877]  And I thought, man, this guy's either a great actor or he didn't, he really thought his name was Fredo.
[00:41:37.177 --> 00:41:39.980]  So now we get to, but I noticed the big guy takes his glasses off.
[00:41:40.781 --> 00:41:43.043]  And it's like, okay, I'm kind of ready to go there at the end.
[00:41:43.914 --> 00:41:46.336]  Yeah, so the whole thing is this kid's a good kid.
[00:41:46.376 --> 00:41:47.297]  He's a college kid.
[00:41:48.218 --> 00:41:52.301]  So and his family has a big family business in New York.
[00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:57.965]  So that's why he really wants to remain anonymous because he's afraid of the backlash and he didn't know that it was going to go this big.
[00:41:58.586 --> 00:42:03.490]  So I you know, I have all I could send you later all the all the contextual text that I have with him.
[00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:05.992]  He does, you know, choose to remain anonymous.
[00:42:06.052 --> 00:42:12.297]  I won't mention it here, but I'll show you the Texas and he's in fear of showing, you know who he is in his name.
[00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:14.220]  So he gave me, you know, all the rights.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.602]  He said, hey, please expose this.
[00:42:15.662 --> 00:42:16.223]  Get this out.
[00:42:16.804 --> 00:42:18.407]  And so I did.
[00:42:18.427 --> 00:42:22.333]  And so, you know, it just goes to show the tolerance of the left that they speak of, right?
[00:42:23.928 --> 00:42:26.370]  Well, we're going to play the audio when we come back, but it's just vicious.
[00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:32.875]  I mean, even if somebody's messing with you, you're a public figure, people go, hey, you know, crap head, I hope you die all the time.
[00:42:33.455 --> 00:42:34.937]  And sometimes they say, screw you back.
[00:42:34.957 --> 00:42:37.799]  Usually I just laugh at them now, or say, get behind me, Satan.
[00:42:37.819 --> 00:42:46.326]  But to say, I'm going to throw you downstairs, I'm going to wreck you, and he's got a couple thugs with him, bowing up, acting tough, it's an amazing video.
[00:42:47.687 --> 00:42:51.810]  And the fact that the dude legitimately said, hey, look, man, I didn't mean it like that, you know?
[00:42:54.315 --> 00:42:59.365]  And then that only encouraged him to act like a thug until the big guy takes his glasses off and looks like he's, well, okay, I'm ready.
[00:42:59.665 --> 00:43:00.707]  He's threatening to basically kill him.
[00:43:00.727 --> 00:43:01.489]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:01.529 --> 00:43:02.110]  Stay there, please.
[00:43:02.759 --> 00:43:05.561]  President Trump was sworn in in January of 2017.
[00:43:05.601 --> 00:43:12.805]  The average farm journal and poll had him at about 50% with farmers.
[00:43:13.506 --> 00:43:28.135]  Fast forward to August 2019, two and a half years later, and he's at 79% in the farm journal survey, which is the most respected, and other farm journals show him as high as 90%.
[00:43:29.716 --> 00:43:35.900]  No president since these journals have existed has had numbers this high.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.181]  Now why am I so excited about that?
[00:43:38.261 --> 00:43:39.362]  Why am I so proud of that?
[00:43:42.084 --> 00:43:43.925]  Farmers got assaulted by the Democrats.
[00:43:44.943 --> 00:43:46.824]  Who tried to take some of their subsidies away.
[00:43:47.605 --> 00:43:51.947]  Trump came in and was reasonable about it and said, hey, foreign countries have internal tariffs.
[00:43:52.087 --> 00:43:52.888]  I'll get rid of those.
[00:43:53.348 --> 00:43:57.410]  We don't need all these subsidies, but we'll actually let you compete directly into those markets.
[00:43:58.231 --> 00:44:02.413]  And when China put massive tariffs on U.S.
[00:44:02.453 --> 00:44:05.695]  farmers, their support for Trump only went up.
[00:44:06.156 --> 00:44:11.319]  And then, when China banned a week ago all U.S.
[00:44:11.359 --> 00:44:11.719]  produce
[00:44:13.956 --> 00:44:14.817]  Trump's numbers went up.
[00:44:15.598 --> 00:44:19.502]  Now, I talk about this all the time, but this is the key to everything.
[00:44:20.323 --> 00:44:31.375]  When Americans and free people know they're being dominated and assaulted and bullied, and they know that it's artificial and that it's from outside, they will rally and come together every time.
[00:44:32.745 --> 00:44:36.707]  You know, I harp on this constantly, that these globalists, the Democrats, are bullies.
[00:44:37.707 --> 00:44:54.055]  And they think that if they attack us, and lie about us, and call us Nazis, and physically come after us, and dox our homes, and tell us the American flag sucks, and that America's bad, that somehow we'll become demoralized, and kneel to them, bow to them.
[00:44:55.455 --> 00:44:56.276]  That's not what's happening.
[00:44:57.316 --> 00:45:00.778]  Americans were asleep before, because they thought everything was fine.
[00:45:02.031 --> 00:45:04.213]  Now Americans know that the country's in peril.
[00:45:04.573 --> 00:45:06.554]  And they know that Trump at Infowars is fighting.
[00:45:07.555 --> 00:45:09.457]  And so now they're ready for a war.
[00:45:10.017 --> 00:45:11.018]  They're ready for a battle.
[00:45:11.958 --> 00:45:18.764]  And so when the Chi-Coms come in and say, we're going to put tariffs on your goods, they say, oh, we support Trump more.
[00:45:20.185 --> 00:45:28.431]  And then when they say, we're banning all your food, we're going to all cost each one of your families a large piece of their paycheck, because China imports a lot of food from us they can't produce.
[00:45:29.417 --> 00:45:30.557]  That's fine, go ahead and do that.
[00:45:31.078 --> 00:45:33.259]  Because you've been screwing our industry over forever.
[00:45:33.519 --> 00:45:38.321]  And the farmers get what the Rust Belt and the factories and the workers have gone through.
[00:45:38.341 --> 00:45:39.301]  And they're standing up.
[00:45:39.441 --> 00:45:45.024]  Because farmers have a long history in this country of standing up to tyranny because they understand how the system operates.
[00:45:45.064 --> 00:45:47.685]  And Thomas Jefferson said it'll be the yeoman farmers
[00:45:48.385 --> 00:45:58.292]  That will end up being the heart of this country, and when the country's in crisis, it'll be the farmers, who are close to the ground, and close to the earth, and close to reality, who are going to be the ones to save the nation.
[00:45:58.692 --> 00:46:11.121]  So I'm so proud of America's farmers, for a race, color, and creed, who are the heartland of this nation, and who understand that, hey, you try to intimidate me, you try to bully me, because our president stood up for our industry?
[00:46:11.781 --> 00:46:17.886]  We're ready to take it on the chin in this fight because we understand it's for a greater good.
[00:46:18.306 --> 00:46:26.052]  America had surrendered for 50 years to globalism and deindustrialization and 30 years selling our jobs up to China.
[00:46:26.372 --> 00:46:28.093]  And that surrender is open.
[00:46:28.874 --> 00:46:29.855]  But I'll say this to farmers.
[00:46:30.615 --> 00:46:31.576]  You think you're under attack?
[00:46:32.036 --> 00:46:33.337]  InfoWars is under attack as well.
[00:46:33.377 --> 00:46:35.939]  And I notice that it's farming families that really support us.
[00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:37.000]  You're our strongest group.
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.442]  You understand that we're in the same position you're in.
[00:46:39.742 --> 00:46:40.763]  You think you've been sanctioned?
[00:46:41.523 --> 00:46:43.204]  They have unleashed hell on us, but you know what?
[00:46:43.504 --> 00:46:55.831]  We're still here because of you, so please, whether it's coffee, or toothpaste, or fish oil, or turmeric, we got great products at great prices at Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, and your financial support is what keeps us here as well.
[00:46:56.351 --> 00:46:57.832]  So, the globalists have sanctioned us.
[00:46:58.652 --> 00:47:02.114]  That's okay, because the farmers of America are standing with us, and we stand with you.
[00:47:06.496 --> 00:47:09.138]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:35.687]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:36.347 --> 00:47:37.448]  I want him shut down.
[00:47:37.528 --> 00:47:38.629]  I want him silenced.
[00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:42.172]  I want them all silenced, all conservatives, all Trump supporters.
[00:47:42.212 --> 00:47:43.233]  Take them off the internet.
[00:47:43.573 --> 00:47:50.258]  That's a quote from Anna Navarro, another one of Chris Cuomo's MSM establishment hack colleagues.
[00:47:50.999 --> 00:47:53.601]  Well, here she is calling Don Jr.
[00:47:54.742 --> 00:48:00.623]  Fredo, because he works in New York and because his first name is Don.
[00:48:00.683 --> 00:48:04.964]  So that's really acting like all Italians are criminals, if you really want to get into stereotypes.
[00:48:06.465 --> 00:48:14.307]  Calling someone who's Italian Fredo, generally again, means that they are just a punk, someone that can't be trusted.
[00:48:14.527 --> 00:48:15.867]  But here's a clip of Ana Navarro.
[00:48:17.704 --> 00:48:20.067]  Daddy kept Fredo back home.
[00:48:20.387 --> 00:48:23.210]  So, who cares what Donald Trump Jr.
[00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:23.410]  says?
[00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:25.532]  Who cares what Donald Trump Jr.
[00:48:25.552 --> 00:48:25.752]  says?
[00:48:26.072 --> 00:48:26.653]  Alright, you know what?
[00:48:26.693 --> 00:48:29.335]  I don't want to talk about that entitlement.
[00:48:31.557 --> 00:48:32.538]  So, there you go.
[00:48:32.578 --> 00:48:34.560]  Now let's introduce our guest here.
[00:48:35.021 --> 00:48:37.443]  He's got a popular show, That's the Point, with Brandon.
[00:48:37.483 --> 00:48:39.365]  He's been on our show, he's been on the other shows before.
[00:48:40.157 --> 00:48:57.992]  And he was sent this footage from an anonymous gentleman who's very successful, family very successful, in New York, who had seen Limbaugh's clips online, and I knew Limbaugh does call him Fredo, because he's kind of the dumb brother from the big mob boss, I mean literally Democrat mob boss, for the Democrat machine.
[00:48:58.052 --> 00:49:04.357]  Not because he's Italian, but because the Democrat machine, you know, runs much of the Northeast, Chicago, San Francisco, into the ground.
[00:49:04.798 --> 00:49:06.219]  And so he was sent this footage
[00:49:07.321 --> 00:49:07.481]  Yes, so...
[00:49:25.916 --> 00:49:26.996]  The source sent it in.
[00:49:27.536 --> 00:49:28.977]  He was in a bar.
[00:49:29.037 --> 00:49:32.898]  They were with some friends and they were walking upstairs, I believe.
[00:49:33.598 --> 00:49:36.338]  And that's when they ran into Chris.
[00:49:36.858 --> 00:49:42.560]  And so from that point, he recognized him, but only registered with the name Fredo.
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.821]  And so he said, hey, Fredo, can I get a photo with you or a picture?
[00:49:47.701 --> 00:49:52.942]  And at that point, like it was that simple and that fast of an exchange.
[00:49:54.422 --> 00:49:59.705]  And in that type of manner, it wasn't like, hey, Fredo, you know, he went up, he say, Fredo, can I get a photo?
[00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:02.926]  And he just went completely ham.
[00:50:03.006 --> 00:50:06.388]  So they turned on the recorder and the phone and recorded it.
[00:50:07.208 --> 00:50:18.373]  And, you know, the rest explains for itself how he acted, trying to break down and make it the word, the name Fredo equivalent to the N word.
[00:50:20.379 --> 00:50:21.880]  I don't see where he got that twist from.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:27.003]  So that's just amazing how they try to spin that narrative so fast.
[00:50:27.443 --> 00:50:32.186]  And CNN saying, oh, they were saying he was a racial slur, so we back Cuomo.
[00:50:32.746 --> 00:50:36.188]  So what they're doing is just greenlighting that type of behavior for the left.
[00:50:36.228 --> 00:50:44.653]  But if that was somebody on the right, they'd be crucified, tarred, and feathered, and walk through with everybody screaming, shame, shame, shame on them.
[00:50:45.626 --> 00:50:46.047]  Oh, 100%.
[00:51:08.172 --> 00:51:15.378]  I believe one of them were, because I know there was a couple of them, you know, his friends, and then also Cuomo's guys.
[00:51:15.398 --> 00:51:19.281]  Yeah, so then Cuomo starts saying, well, that you should know not to dis... I mean, it's just total crap.
[00:51:19.601 --> 00:51:21.662]  Everybody knows that it means somebody's weak.
[00:51:22.163 --> 00:51:27.727]  But again, if the guy doesn't really know who he is, believes it's off the nickname, Cuomo, I think, better get ready.
[00:51:27.767 --> 00:51:33.672]  Because if Chris Cuomo wasn't known as Fredo by everybody before, he is now going to be known as Fredo Cuomo.
[00:51:33.712 --> 00:51:34.172]  What do you think?
[00:51:35.467 --> 00:51:36.528]  Forever in a day.
[00:51:36.548 --> 00:51:36.528]  100%.
[00:51:36.568 --> 00:51:40.770]  That is hashtag fake news Fredo.
[00:51:41.611 --> 00:51:42.872]  Fredo Cuomo.
[00:51:43.572 --> 00:51:42.872]  100%.
[00:51:45.193 --> 00:51:49.296]  But the thing is, Hollywood can't even write this stuff, man.
[00:51:50.156 --> 00:51:55.199]  It writes itself, and it's pure gold that they expose themselves.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:02.464]  You really don't have to do anything nowadays, but bring a camera out and put it in front of a Democrat-Liberal, and you're gonna go ham.
[00:52:02.604 --> 00:52:03.144]  You know what I mean?
[00:52:03.204 --> 00:52:04.485]  And they're gonna expose themselves.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:17.351]  It's ridiculously that simple and it just goes to show the pull where our society is now turning to and falling down at such a rapid rate.
[00:52:18.812 --> 00:52:20.173]  You're right, but that was my next question.
[00:52:20.193 --> 00:52:21.054]  How bad is it going to get?
[00:52:21.074 --> 00:52:25.458]  But I want to play this clip, folks, because there's so many of them, but this is the same
[00:52:28.234 --> 00:52:28.774]  We're good to go.
[00:52:53.723 --> 00:52:58.285]  Public outdoor banquet, ran over people, but because his brother's the governor, he got away with it.
[00:52:58.665 --> 00:53:04.087]  He was so drunk, racing in the middle of a town fair, through the fair.
[00:53:05.007 --> 00:53:07.788]  I think he's like, what is he, 6'5", 6'6"?
[00:53:07.828 --> 00:53:08.509]  He's a big guy.
[00:53:09.809 --> 00:53:11.910]  But I'll tell him, hey, I'm only 5'11", Cuomo.
[00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:13.491]  I'll call you Freddo to your face.
[00:53:13.571 --> 00:53:14.271]  You want to punch me?
[00:53:15.089 --> 00:53:15.509]  Believe me.
[00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:16.370]  Believe me.
[00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:17.210]  Let's go.
[00:53:17.531 --> 00:53:18.331]  You want to attack me?
[00:53:18.531 --> 00:53:19.112]  You thug.
[00:53:19.372 --> 00:53:19.812]  You punk.
[00:53:20.392 --> 00:53:22.574]  I guarantee you, if I ever get you down, you're not going to like it.
[00:53:22.814 --> 00:53:24.855]  I'm not going to attack you first, you thug.
[00:53:24.895 --> 00:53:25.376]  You punk.
[00:53:25.596 --> 00:53:26.056]  You bully.
[00:53:26.316 --> 00:53:27.837]  But you're Fredo.
[00:53:28.017 --> 00:53:31.840]  And I swear, if I ever see you anywhere, I'm going to tell you, hey, Fredo.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:35.062]  I don't want a photo of your punk ass, Fredo.
[00:53:35.122 --> 00:53:35.782]  You thug.
[00:53:36.283 --> 00:53:38.964]  Quit running around threatening people and saying America was never great.
[00:53:39.105 --> 00:53:39.845]  It'll never be great.
[00:53:40.025 --> 00:53:42.787]  You and your thug brother are a disgrace to this nation.
[00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.461]  You anti-American, Chi-Com funded trash!
[00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:47.162]  And America's waking up... Sorry, I'm ranting.
[00:53:47.403 --> 00:53:47.723]  I'm ranting.
[00:53:47.743 --> 00:53:48.163]  You made me mad.
[00:53:48.363 --> 00:53:49.864]  Let's go to this censored video.
[00:53:50.084 --> 00:53:52.286]  That's a whole other story coming up with our guest that got it.
[00:53:52.806 --> 00:53:57.088]  CNN and others obviously lobbied to have it taken down, but now it's been put back up.
[00:53:57.329 --> 00:53:57.909]  Here's the video.
[00:53:58.769 --> 00:53:59.830]  I'm not going to tell you!
[00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:00.891]  You want to call me s***?
[00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:01.531]  Call me s***!
[00:54:01.611 --> 00:54:02.852]  I'm not doing anything!
[00:54:02.992 --> 00:54:04.153]  I'll f***ing wreck your s***!
[00:54:04.213 --> 00:54:05.554]  I'll f***ing wreck your s***!
[00:54:08.564 --> 00:54:10.546]  No, punk-ass bitches from the right call me Fredo.
[00:54:10.626 --> 00:54:12.068]  My name is Chris Cuomo.
[00:54:12.388 --> 00:54:13.890]  I'm an anchor on CNN.
[00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:15.472]  Fredo is from the Godfather.
[00:54:15.992 --> 00:54:17.714]  He was our weak brother.
[00:54:17.794 --> 00:54:19.656]  And they use it as an Italian aspersion.
[00:54:19.716 --> 00:54:20.838]  Any of you Italian?
[00:54:21.038 --> 00:54:22.019]  Are you Italian?
[00:54:22.039 --> 00:54:23.520]  It's a f***ing insult to your people.
[00:54:23.621 --> 00:54:26.123]  It's an insult to your f***ing people.
[00:54:26.223 --> 00:54:27.365]  It's like the n-word for us.
[00:54:27.785 --> 00:54:29.746]  Is that a cool f***ing thing?
[00:54:29.806 --> 00:54:33.248]  You're a much more reasonable guy in person than you seem to be on television.
[00:54:33.268 --> 00:54:35.790]  Yeah, but if you want to play, then we'll f***ing play.
[00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:40.433]  If that's something you want to say about what I do on television, then say it, but don't f***ing call me a f***er.
[00:54:40.453 --> 00:54:40.893]  Hey, listen.
[00:54:40.933 --> 00:54:41.914]  I don't want any problems.
[00:54:42.334 --> 00:54:43.575]  Yeah, you're gonna have a big f***ing problem.
[00:54:43.595 --> 00:54:44.035]  What's the problem?
[00:54:44.135 --> 00:54:45.476]  It's a little different on TV.
[00:54:45.496 --> 00:54:46.376]  Don't f***ing insult me like that.
[00:54:46.396 --> 00:54:47.037]  I didn't insult you.
[00:54:47.217 --> 00:54:47.817]  You called me Fredo.
[00:54:47.877 --> 00:54:49.058]  It's like I call you Punk Fish.
[00:54:49.098 --> 00:54:49.618]  You like that?
[00:54:49.758 --> 00:54:50.999]  You want that to be your nickname?
[00:54:51.019 --> 00:54:51.860]  I didn't call you that.
[00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.020]  You called me Fredo.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:53.861]  You know my name now, f***er.
[00:54:54.161 --> 00:54:55.202]  I thought your name was.
[00:54:55.262 --> 00:54:56.983]  You did not think my name was Fredo.
[00:54:57.003 --> 00:54:57.744]  Don't be a liar.
[00:54:57.784 --> 00:54:58.724]  Stand up like a man.
[00:54:58.844 --> 00:54:59.925]  I'm standing up, man.
[00:55:00.125 --> 00:55:02.047]  You have to be a man out here.
[00:55:02.127 --> 00:55:03.468]  You can own it.
[00:55:03.508 --> 00:55:05.309]  You can own what you say.
[00:55:05.389 --> 00:55:07.030]  Listen, I have a problem with you, man.
[00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:08.251]  You're going to have a problem.
[00:55:08.291 --> 00:55:08.391]  What?
[00:55:08.431 --> 00:55:09.692]  What are you going to do about it?
[00:55:10.152 --> 00:55:13.335]  I'll throw you down these stairs like a punk.
[00:55:13.355 --> 00:55:13.856]  Please do.
[00:55:13.876 --> 00:55:16.618]  Why, so you don't want to sue?
[00:55:16.818 --> 00:55:17.559]  So you can f***ing sue?
[00:55:17.599 --> 00:55:18.580]  Well, why don't you do it?
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.781]  Go take a swing then.
[00:55:19.801 --> 00:55:21.262]  You want to call me faggot?
[00:55:21.522 --> 00:55:22.083]  Take a f***ing swing.
[00:55:22.123 --> 00:55:22.744]  Take a f***ing swing.
[00:55:22.784 --> 00:55:23.724]  Watch your f***ing hands.
[00:55:23.764 --> 00:55:24.685]  Watch your f***ing hands.
[00:55:24.705 --> 00:55:25.266]  Take a swing.
[00:55:25.286 --> 00:55:25.806]  Come on, boy.
[00:55:25.826 --> 00:55:26.547]  Come on, boy.
[00:55:26.567 --> 00:55:27.568]  You want to call me s***?
[00:55:27.928 --> 00:55:29.629]  I'm breaking it up.
[00:55:29.669 --> 00:55:30.809]  I'm breaking it up.
[00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:51.353]  And I tell you, he makes that guy who's really genuine at the end go, OK, we'll go ahead.
[00:55:51.373 --> 00:55:53.134]  And the guy's bigger than it looks like in Cuomo.
[00:55:53.515 --> 00:55:54.616]  Looks like a really big dude.
[00:55:54.696 --> 00:55:59.619]  So Cuomo was about to get his ass handed to him, and I think he figured it out and finally stopped.
[00:55:59.639 --> 00:56:08.366]  But going back to our guest, the host of That's The Point with Brandon, other points that need to be added to this are obviously tell people the backstory of them trying to suppress this video.
[00:56:09.427 --> 00:56:13.389]  Yeah, so OK, so well, first of all, I want to clarify something with that video.
[00:56:15.114 --> 00:56:23.501]  Hannity lied and retweeted the video on Twitter and said that, oh, in my honest opinion, Cuomo was right.
[00:56:24.222 --> 00:56:29.207]  You know, the guy heckled him or whatever in front of his kids with his nine-year-old daughter and family.
[00:56:29.707 --> 00:56:31.248]  A complete lie.
[00:56:31.529 --> 00:56:35.392]  Cuomo was there with a woman and a group of guys, as you could tell.
[00:56:35.612 --> 00:56:36.853]  There was no children present.
[00:56:37.214 --> 00:56:41.978]  So Hannity retweeted that without even trying to find out
[00:56:42.538 --> 00:56:46.299]  Any further backstories, so I'm pretty surprised at that.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.680]  But as far as.
[00:56:52.141 --> 00:56:53.762]  Background for the video, I mean.
[00:56:55.342 --> 00:56:59.684]  They all for them taking it down was yeah, so they with no no word.
[00:56:59.704 --> 00:57:03.385]  I went to go check my view count to see where it was at and I noticed that the whole video was gone.
[00:57:03.725 --> 00:57:07.246]  Then I received an email saying all my stuff was.
[00:57:07.266 --> 00:57:08.687]  Taken down.
[00:57:10.507 --> 00:57:12.488]  And so I appealed it right away.
[00:57:13.169 --> 00:57:16.751]  And I don't know what happened from Donald Trump tweeting or Donald Trump Jr.
[00:57:16.771 --> 00:57:18.712]  tweeting it and me doing the appeal.
[00:57:18.952 --> 00:57:21.673]  But that was the fastest return on appeal that I've ever seen.
[00:57:22.594 --> 00:57:23.434]  They took it down.
[00:57:23.474 --> 00:57:24.375]  It usually takes.
[00:57:24.395 --> 00:57:24.715]  I'm sorry.
[00:57:24.915 --> 00:57:26.776]  Go ahead.
[00:57:27.637 --> 00:57:29.358]  I'll say it was down for about an hour.
[00:57:29.898 --> 00:57:36.502]  And within that time, it went right back up with that email in the return saying that they.
[00:57:36.802 --> 00:57:37.022]  Oh, yeah.
[00:57:37.628 --> 00:57:39.149]  I mean, usually an appeal takes two weeks.
[00:57:39.889 --> 00:57:48.314]  One time the Young Turks had my channel taken down when I had a confrontation with them, because they were at the Google Studio area, and they put it right back up as well.
[00:57:48.654 --> 00:57:49.434]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:49.534 --> 00:57:50.214]  Stay with us, sir.
[00:57:50.495 --> 00:57:51.495]  Second hour, straight ahead.
[00:57:55.257 --> 00:57:57.098]  Let's go to James in Massachusetts.
[00:57:57.478 --> 00:57:58.159]  James, you're on the air.
[00:57:58.179 --> 00:57:58.659]  Thanks for calling.
[00:58:00.456 --> 00:58:01.036]  Hello, Alex.
[00:58:01.656 --> 00:58:03.517]  God bless General Jones.
[00:58:03.577 --> 00:58:05.758]  May you live in peace and love forever.
[00:58:05.818 --> 00:58:06.838]  In Christ's name, we pray.
[00:58:06.978 --> 00:58:07.738]  God bless you, brother.
[00:58:07.958 --> 00:58:09.219]  And I'd like to thank you also.
[00:58:09.239 --> 00:58:12.560]  You know, my wife and I have been married for 17 years, and we were never able to have kids.
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:21.763]  And after a couple years of taking the B12 and the iodine, and knowing about not using fluoride and not having vaccines, we have a great, healthy, vibrant, six-year-old boy.
[00:58:21.903 --> 00:58:23.123]  And I thank you very much for that.
[00:58:23.263 --> 00:58:25.944]  Well, you know fluoride is meant to block fertility.
[00:58:26.404 --> 00:58:29.385]  It's the bad halogen, but iodine is associated with fertility.
[00:58:29.846 --> 00:58:30.946]  So that's a beautiful story.
[00:58:30.986 --> 00:58:31.986]  That's exciting, my friend.
[00:58:32.146 --> 00:58:36.348]  And I've got all the articles right here about IQ, fertility, being boosted on iodine.
[00:58:36.908 --> 00:58:37.348]  You name it.
[00:58:37.628 --> 00:58:41.670]  That's why the system fights to keep people from getting good iodine and other things that we talk about here.
[00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:43.971]  Even though I get it from InfoWarsTore.com, it doesn't matter to me.
[00:58:44.031 --> 00:58:46.312]  Just research what deficiencies are doing.
[00:58:46.452 --> 00:58:49.593]  But get back to you and your wife and recap the story you were telling.
[00:58:49.793 --> 00:59:13.319]  So we've been married for 17 years and we never had any children and we bought the water filter first and we cut out the fluoride and the glyphosate and then we started taking X2 and B12 and about a year or so later my wife got pregnant with our baby boy and with the iodine that she was taking and everything he's so bright and you can just see the glow in his face and he's always smiling and we just owe it all to you and you're our hero Alex.
[00:59:13.479 --> 00:59:14.801]  Well that's just beautiful, brother.
[00:59:15.101 --> 00:59:18.244]  And again, it shows the system knows all this.
[00:59:18.585 --> 00:59:22.930]  And it works to keep the people from just getting basic things the body has to have.
[00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:25.513]  You have to have vitamin C. You have to have iodine.
[00:59:25.853 --> 00:59:26.694]  You have to have water.
[00:59:27.034 --> 00:59:28.016]  You have to have oxygen.
[00:59:28.456 --> 00:59:30.777]  Instead, the whole system works to block that.
[00:59:30.897 --> 00:59:31.938]  It's just so powerful.
[00:59:32.018 --> 00:59:33.099]  It's what we're made of.
[00:59:33.519 --> 00:59:35.440]  I'm sitting here trying to explain this to people.
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:36.901]  We're not just making this stuff up.
[00:59:37.541 --> 00:59:38.201]  It's just everything.
[00:59:38.221 --> 00:59:40.102]  But again, the other iodines are bound.
[00:59:40.122 --> 00:59:41.243]  You don't absorb them.
[00:59:41.663 --> 00:59:43.104]  Everyone calls their iodine atomic.
[00:59:43.344 --> 00:59:45.765]  I wish everyone else was selling atomic iodine.
[00:59:45.865 --> 00:59:46.246]  They're not.
[00:59:46.426 --> 00:59:48.047]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:56.349 --> 01:00:02.996]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:12.386 --> 01:00:14.408]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:14.828 --> 01:00:16.150]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.048 --> 01:00:26.050]  So Sean Hannity's probably been lied to.
[01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:28.031]  And of course, they live in New York.
[01:00:28.051 --> 01:00:29.192]  He's probably friends with Cuomo.
[01:00:29.733 --> 01:00:30.693]  Cuomo's kind of run things.
[01:00:30.773 --> 01:00:31.134]  I get it.
[01:00:31.174 --> 01:00:37.039]  But he has tweeted that the video that's out there that's on Drudge, that these guys came up and confronted Cuomo with his family.
[01:00:37.299 --> 01:00:38.019]  That's not true.
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:40.421]  Cuomo was with some other big guys and a woman.
[01:00:40.722 --> 01:00:45.826]  The guy thought his name was Frodo because, excuse me, Frodo, because he was with Bill Baggins.
[01:00:46.026 --> 01:00:46.486]  Fredo.
[01:00:47.627 --> 01:00:49.409]  And so he simply said, hey, Fredo.
[01:00:50.089 --> 01:00:53.412]  But he is now known, Chris Cuomo, as Chris
[01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:55.530]  Fredo Cuomo.
[01:00:55.971 --> 01:00:56.371]  Period.
[01:00:57.071 --> 01:00:58.151]  And this is the reality.
[01:00:58.471 --> 01:01:04.093]  He's a guy that says your 11-year-old daughters should be in showers with full-grown men who have male genitals.
[01:01:04.473 --> 01:01:05.293]  You can read his tweets.
[01:01:05.653 --> 01:01:09.434]  He's a guy that threatens to attack guests on a show and thugs up on people.
[01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:12.815]  He's a guy that calls Trump a gangster and all these names.
[01:01:13.276 --> 01:01:15.256]  And here's more of his hypocrisy right now.
[01:01:16.497 --> 01:01:17.477]  Then we get to the heart of it.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:19.301]  The face-to-face encounter.
[01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:23.904]  The man, Nathan Phillips, apparently wanted to diffuse the tension, and he walked up to do exactly that.
[01:01:23.965 --> 01:01:30.710]  And surely the kid, Nick Sandman, he doesn't seem to be afraid, but he did make a choice, and that was to make it into a standoff.
[01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:32.371]  That was not a good choice.
[01:01:32.831 --> 01:01:33.472]  Was it legal?
[01:01:33.872 --> 01:01:34.072]  Sure.
[01:01:34.092 --> 01:01:35.474]  That's not my test.
[01:01:36.054 --> 01:01:37.055]  And it shouldn't be THE test.
[01:01:37.135 --> 01:01:37.595]  Here's mine.
[01:01:38.136 --> 01:01:40.658]  If that were my son, who happens to go to a great Catholic school,
[01:01:41.411 --> 01:01:42.391]  Would I like what he did?
[01:01:43.211 --> 01:01:46.572]  If I were there, would I have allowed the kids to be in that situation?
[01:01:47.092 --> 01:01:48.873]  No and no.
[01:01:51.293 --> 01:02:01.936]  So, Chris Fredo Cuomo, that's his official name, Chris Fredo Cuomo, or just Fredo the bully Cuomo, comes up
[01:02:03.018 --> 01:02:07.403]  When somebody asks, hey, Fredo, take a picture with me, gets in their face, threatens to kill them, basically.
[01:02:07.703 --> 01:02:08.925]  Throw them downstairs, wreck them.
[01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:17.014]  He says, oh, when the kids have a bunch of people march up to them that are threatening to kill them, beating drums in their face, that they were bad for standing their ground.
[01:02:17.374 --> 01:02:18.896]  But he comes up and thugs out.
[01:02:19.376 --> 01:02:20.838]  We have the host of That's The Point.
[01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:22.261]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:22.281 --> 01:02:25.544]  First and foremost, he protected Antifa when they went through that whole process.
[01:02:25.844 --> 01:02:28.346]  He's always been an advocate for extreme leftism behavior.
[01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:46.196]  Always 100%.
[01:02:46.436 --> 01:02:53.160]  One thing I do want to point out is how fast and quickly they try to spin the narrative.
[01:02:54.421 --> 01:03:02.445]  Trying to say that there was like, you know, the family there and then they try to target the word Fredo as a racial slur.
[01:03:03.331 --> 01:03:06.274]  And then, you know, it started trending as, you know, that fast.
[01:03:06.294 --> 01:03:15.924]  So once they realized, though, that it did mean that and the whole masses knew that they couldn't, you know, they're still trying to push it, but it's not really holding any water.
[01:03:18.203 --> 01:03:21.025]  I definitely want to host a show here.
[01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:24.308]  You should host a show here because you make better points than I do.
[01:03:24.728 --> 01:03:25.709]  You cut right to the chase.
[01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:31.274]  In fact, looking at the internet today, no one's buying that Fredo is a racial slur and it's backfired.
[01:03:31.294 --> 01:03:32.434]  And I should have just said up front.
[01:03:32.935 --> 01:03:34.836]  He came up, thugged out, did this.
[01:03:36.177 --> 01:03:37.458]  The media tried to cover it up.
[01:03:37.498 --> 01:03:38.379]  They tried to spin it.
[01:03:38.459 --> 01:03:39.420]  It blew up in their face.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.241]  And now it's one of the top trending things.
[01:03:41.462 --> 01:03:43.583]  And he's now known as Fredo Cuomo.
[01:03:43.944 --> 01:03:45.145]  He literally jumped the shark.
[01:03:47.133 --> 01:03:47.853]  Yeah, no, 100%.
[01:03:47.893 --> 01:03:52.174]  He tied himself, you know, he stepped right into his own trap, though.
[01:03:52.194 --> 01:03:58.675]  Like, he did exactly what he says he speaks against, but yet also advocates for.
[01:03:58.995 --> 01:03:59.956]  He's a complete mess.
[01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:00.916]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:04:02.296 --> 01:04:07.017]  You know, one thing I do want to say is, I don't know if you guys seen this shirt, though.
[01:04:07.337 --> 01:04:08.197]  These colors don't run.
[01:04:08.217 --> 01:04:10.118]  You can get that at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:04:11.918 --> 01:04:12.138]  But,
[01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:15.425]  Uh, you know, like these colors don't run, man.
[01:04:15.725 --> 01:04:18.828]  Uh, you know, never run from what you stand for and never run from the truth.
[01:04:18.868 --> 01:04:19.889]  Video proves itself.
[01:04:19.949 --> 01:04:21.631]  He stepped himself into his own trap.
[01:04:22.231 --> 01:04:26.816]  Uh, now they're trying to spin the narrative of Fredo being racist and Italians are like, what are you talking about?
[01:04:26.836 --> 01:04:28.477]  And they're like, forget about it.
[01:04:29.839 --> 01:04:31.200]  And, uh, that doesn't even make sense.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.181]  And, um,
[01:04:32.901 --> 01:04:40.589]  The way YouTube tried to censor it so fast and the way they tried to take down that video was, you know, it really didn't surprise me, but it was amazing.
[01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:47.016]  But the backlash that I guess we put on them or Trump put on them or however when they retweeted, they put it right back up.
[01:04:48.037 --> 01:04:51.981]  So, you know, we got to fight against that censorship like they're doing the Infowars.
[01:04:53.883 --> 01:04:55.064]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[01:04:55.104 --> 01:04:56.905]  I want to ask you one more question when we come back.
[01:04:57.225 --> 01:04:59.386]  How can Fredo politically survive this?
[01:04:59.406 --> 01:05:01.188]  We'll talk about it with the man who put the video up.
[01:05:01.368 --> 01:05:02.528]  It's on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:05:02.849 --> 01:05:03.189]  Straight ahead.
[01:05:36.186 --> 01:06:00.721]  What in the world's going on here?
[01:06:15.363 --> 01:06:18.755]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:06:19.558 --> 01:06:21.365]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.086 --> 01:06:29.368]  That's The Point with Brandon is the name of his very popular online show.
[01:06:29.408 --> 01:06:30.989]  He also does a lot of great interviews.
[01:06:31.389 --> 01:06:33.550]  People send him a lot of really cool video.
[01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:39.813]  He's been a guest on my show, been a guest on the other InfoWars shows with his prolific work on YouTube and on other platforms.
[01:06:40.233 --> 01:06:47.377]  But this story is a lot bigger than Chris Cuomo, the no ratings, hit and run thug, nobody
[01:06:48.411 --> 01:06:55.736]  Fredo-esque brother of another America-hating thug, Andrew Cuomo, who said, if you're pro-life or pro-gun, get out of New York.
[01:06:55.776 --> 01:06:56.657]  People said, oh, you're joking.
[01:06:56.677 --> 01:06:57.958]  He said, no, get out of here.
[01:06:58.798 --> 01:07:00.459]  Then he said, America was never that great.
[01:07:00.799 --> 01:07:01.500]  It'll never be great.
[01:07:03.381 --> 01:07:04.522]  And people are like, did he really mean that?
[01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:05.483]  He's like, yeah, I mean that.
[01:07:05.623 --> 01:07:07.524]  That's who these leftists are.
[01:07:09.085 --> 01:07:12.827]  Chris supports Antifa going out and attacking innocent people and violating the First Amendment.
[01:07:13.328 --> 01:07:16.670]  But he doesn't support the Covington kids standing their ground.
[01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:17.991]  We played that clip.
[01:07:19.059 --> 01:07:20.540]  Earlier, but he's really jumped the shark.
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.302]  Now, Fredo's one of the top trending terms.
[01:07:23.702 --> 01:07:26.444]  They tried to say that it was racist to even say that.
[01:07:26.484 --> 01:07:28.125]  Didn't know that it was Italians even saying it.
[01:07:28.325 --> 01:07:31.427]  Wouldn't matter if you were a black guy or an Irish guy or a Chinese guy.
[01:07:31.707 --> 01:07:33.048]  Fredo means you're a weak person.
[01:07:33.648 --> 01:07:39.892]  This guy thought he was Fredo because he heard Rush Limbaugh and saw clips of Limbaugh calling him Fredo.
[01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:46.777]  But boy, I tell you, the bullying of Chris Cuomo is just emblematic of how all their bullying isn't working anymore.
[01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:53.665]  I'll shake 50 hands, literally, before one person walks up to me while I'm here in San Diego and says, F you, I hope you die.
[01:07:55.646 --> 01:07:58.268]  It doesn't matter because they're nobody's folks and they're upset.
[01:07:59.088 --> 01:08:02.130]  Cuomo doesn't have 300,000 viewers of a show.
[01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:03.491]  He's a joke.
[01:08:04.471 --> 01:08:05.832]  He's a legend in his own mind.
[01:08:06.993 --> 01:08:11.736]  And that's why they have to censor, hoping by censoring us, the truth won't come out.
[01:08:12.056 --> 01:08:14.458]  It's Cuomo, I haven't played this clip, but let's cue it up.
[01:08:15.378 --> 01:08:16.259]  Cuomo that said,
[01:08:17.256 --> 01:08:24.019]  Let's not worry about, in the Jeffrey Epstein list, the names of who went to the pedophile island.
[01:08:24.059 --> 01:08:25.600]  Let's not get caught into that.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:30.942]  Remember, he's the one that said, when these WikiLeaks come out three years ago, he said, you're not allowed to look at WikiLeaks.
[01:08:31.262 --> 01:08:32.003]  I'm allowed to.
[01:08:32.923 --> 01:08:37.445]  But if you read them, which is totally legal for you to read them as a citizen, you're going to go to prison.
[01:08:39.534 --> 01:08:48.480]  Let's go to that clip and try to cue Chris Cuomo up because on the whole situation with the WikiLeaks because I mean this guy is just too insane.
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.362]  But first, here's the clip that I was just talking about.
[01:08:53.223 --> 01:08:53.603]  Here it is.
[01:08:56.745 --> 01:08:57.666]  Call me s**t!
[01:08:57.946 --> 01:08:58.426]  Call me s**t!
[01:08:58.466 --> 01:09:00.908]  I'll f**king wreck your s**t!
[01:09:00.968 --> 01:09:02.609]  I'll f**king wreck your s**t!
[01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:07.313]  Punk-ass bitches from the right call me Fredo.
[01:09:07.733 --> 01:09:08.875]  My name is Chris Pomore.
[01:09:08.935 --> 01:09:10.196]  I'm an anchor on CNN.
[01:09:10.276 --> 01:09:12.259]  Fredo is from the Godfather.
[01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.482]  He was our weak brother.
[01:09:14.622 --> 01:09:16.444]  And they use it as an Italian aspersion.
[01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:17.245]  Any of you Italian?
[01:09:17.385 --> 01:09:18.927]  Are you Italian?
[01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:20.469]  It's an insult to your people.
[01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:22.692]  It's an insult to your people.
[01:09:22.812 --> 01:09:24.114]  It's like the n-word for us.
[01:09:24.554 --> 01:09:26.516]  Okay, is that a cool f***ing thing?
[01:09:26.536 --> 01:09:30.019]  You're a much more reasonable guy in person than you seem to be on television.
[01:09:30.039 --> 01:09:32.120]  Yeah, but if you want to play, you want to f***ing play.
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:35.903]  You got something you want to say about what I do on television, then say it, but don't f***ing call me a f***er.
[01:09:35.924 --> 01:09:36.164]  Hey, listen.
[01:09:36.184 --> 01:09:36.504]  What, what?
[01:09:36.524 --> 01:09:37.305]  I don't want any problems.
[01:09:37.345 --> 01:09:39.627]  Yeah, you're gonna have a big f***ing problem.
[01:09:39.647 --> 01:09:40.327]  What's the problem?
[01:09:40.347 --> 01:09:41.368]  It's a little different on TV.
[01:09:41.788 --> 01:09:42.249]  What's the problem?
[01:09:42.269 --> 01:09:43.130]  Don't f***ing insult me like that.
[01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:43.790]  I didn't insult you.
[01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.571]  You called me Fredo.
[01:09:44.591 --> 01:09:45.832]  It's like I call you Pump Fish.
[01:09:45.852 --> 01:09:46.412]  You like that?
[01:09:46.632 --> 01:09:47.773]  You want that to be your nickname?
[01:09:47.793 --> 01:09:48.634]  I didn't call you that.
[01:09:48.714 --> 01:09:49.815]  You called me Fredo.
[01:09:49.855 --> 01:09:50.636]  You know my name's not f***ed.
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.740]  Again, that's just some of the exchange.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.762]  Here is clip 16 where he's talking about Epstein.
[01:10:08.985 --> 01:10:10.926]  Well, we'll get that clip for you.
[01:10:10.946 --> 01:10:11.706]  It's here on my list.
[01:10:12.366 --> 01:10:14.027]  Going back to the host.
[01:10:16.781 --> 01:10:19.142]  That's the point with Brandon.
[01:10:19.502 --> 01:10:20.483]  You made a lot of great points.
[01:10:20.523 --> 01:10:22.104]  What are some of the other points you think need to be made here?
[01:10:23.805 --> 01:10:31.168]  Just the fact how CNN gives passes, how the mainstream media gives a pass to somebody like that.
[01:10:31.468 --> 01:10:44.775]  And they talk about how Trump and us Trump supporters or Trump supporters like that are privileged or white privileged and they get away with everything.
[01:10:45.276 --> 01:10:58.562]  I mean, if anything is a perfect example of what they claim to be of white privilege, wouldn't that be Cuomo not being arrested for physically threatening and injuring somebody and threatening to harm them?
[01:10:59.383 --> 01:11:00.463]  Isn't that a charge?
[01:11:02.264 --> 01:11:02.784]  You know what I mean?
[01:11:02.824 --> 01:11:04.225]  Well, that's exactly what's going on.
[01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:10.737]  What do you make of him saying don't investigate the accomplices with Epstein?
[01:11:10.797 --> 01:11:11.397]  We have the clip.
[01:11:11.417 --> 01:11:14.919]  We're going to add it and post later when we post this on Infowars.com.
[01:11:15.179 --> 01:11:15.779]  What do you make of that?
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:33.469]  Well, I mean, listen, that river runs deep and anybody on that side and up at that level knows why he doesn't want that not to be investigated because those branches reach out far and that touches everybody in the mainstream pretty much.
[01:11:34.071 --> 01:11:34.912]  And he's
[01:11:54.997 --> 01:11:57.239]  Prevent the truth from being exposed.
[01:11:57.659 --> 01:12:11.369]  Especially like this kind of guy, Chris Como, who's continuously caught in lies and using double standards the way he talks and allowing other people to mention the same name, Fredo, but never calling it out until it's said to him and all of a sudden it's the end of the world.
[01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:14.412]  It's the new N-word.
[01:12:14.492 --> 01:12:17.374]  Fredo's the new N-word now, I guess, for Italians.
[01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:18.750]  Who would have known, right?
[01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:20.511]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:12:21.051 --> 01:12:23.253]  I really do appreciate you joining us.
[01:12:23.313 --> 01:12:31.116]  I know you're coming on The War Room today, somewhere in between 3 and 6 p.m., and where's the best place for people to find your great show?
[01:12:31.536 --> 01:12:33.517]  That's The Point with Brandon.
[01:12:34.658 --> 01:12:37.179]  Yeah, that's The Point with Brandon on YouTube.
[01:12:37.719 --> 01:12:38.540]  You can Google that.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:40.161]  Also, that's The Point with Brandon.
[01:12:40.221 --> 01:12:40.881]  It should pop up.
[01:12:41.841 --> 01:12:47.762]  Uh, on Twitter is the same thing, and Instagram is that's the point underscore Brandon.
[01:12:47.802 --> 01:12:55.024]  Check out, um, every link or every video in my, um, link in the description has my TTP shop merch.
[01:12:55.564 --> 01:12:58.005]  Also, uh, guys get to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:12:58.425 --> 01:12:59.945]  Uh, they have this awesome Betsy Ross.
[01:13:00.345 --> 01:13:01.246]  These colors don't run.
[01:13:01.986 --> 01:13:03.106]  Um, yes.
[01:13:03.386 --> 01:13:05.107]  So that's where everybody can find me.
[01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:05.667]  God bless you.
[01:13:05.707 --> 01:13:06.927]  We appreciate you coming on.
[01:13:08.713 --> 01:13:12.938]  Hey, thank you so much for coming on with this.
[01:13:13.939 --> 01:13:26.714]  Again, there's so much big news around the world, but this Chris Cuomo thing is really, really a big deal because it shows him thugging out and it shows the media trying to cover it up.
[01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:29.091]  And it shows all the different angles.
[01:13:29.111 --> 01:13:34.294]  We're going to post this live interview you just saw to InfoWars.com in the next 30 minutes or so.
[01:13:34.574 --> 01:13:35.615]  Hope you share with everybody.
[01:13:35.855 --> 01:13:38.076]  We're going to add him saying you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks.
[01:13:38.577 --> 01:13:42.999]  We're going to add him saying that you shouldn't investigate the other people involved with Epstein.
[01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.041]  I mean, I mean, this is absolutely critical.
[01:13:46.061 --> 01:13:51.484]  We're going to play those clips next segment, too, because this is the big show that reaches millions of people.
[01:13:51.925 --> 01:13:55.667]  And it's very, very and very important that people know about this.
[01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:57.072]  We're good to go.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:23.983]  That we are under globalist attack because we tell the truth, we don't back down, and that we're never going to give in or shut up as long as we have support.
[01:14:24.463 --> 01:14:25.404]  I won't back down.
[01:14:25.424 --> 01:14:26.424]  I won't sell out.
[01:14:26.604 --> 01:14:27.384]  I won't give in.
[01:14:27.404 --> 01:14:27.464]  But
[01:14:30.114 --> 01:14:31.695]  I could give out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:32.276 --> 01:14:36.739]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, without your support, we're not going to be here.
[01:14:37.159 --> 01:14:48.828]  We make it really easy with the best air filtration, the best water filtration, the great shortwave radios, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, really amazing books and films, and the Betsy Ross t-shirt.
[01:14:48.848 --> 01:14:52.271]  You know, we've gone through two limited edition designs of that.
[01:14:52.591 --> 01:14:56.194]  We have the Don't Tread on Me Betsy Ross flag that's about to sell out.
[01:14:57.265 --> 01:14:59.767]  And then that's it for those designs of those.
[01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:03.690]  A lot of other great collector shirts and info or store dot com.
[01:15:04.171 --> 01:15:06.012]  And I keep saying today's the last day.
[01:15:06.112 --> 01:15:07.353]  Sunday was supposed to be the last day.
[01:15:07.373 --> 01:15:08.494]  I said, OK, Monday.
[01:15:11.722 --> 01:15:17.826]  One year anniversary, storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, and 50-60% off all the supplements.
[01:15:17.886 --> 01:15:20.748]  Well, a bunch of them are getting close to selling out.
[01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.890]  Some of the stuff doesn't come back in for three months.
[01:15:23.490 --> 01:15:25.512]  And so they're like, hey, it's time to go back to regular price.
[01:15:26.112 --> 01:15:27.513]  You need to come up with some new specials.
[01:15:28.053 --> 01:15:30.615]  Well, I've been so busy with all of this and on vacation.
[01:15:30.635 --> 01:15:31.496]  It's not really a vacation.
[01:15:31.516 --> 01:15:34.217]  I've been working the whole time.
[01:15:34.237 --> 01:15:34.778]  Say 80% of the time.
[01:15:35.378 --> 01:15:37.600]  That I haven't gotten the new special up.
[01:15:38.703 --> 01:15:44.248]  When I get off air here in a minute, because Owen Schroeder is going to take over and Mark Rondas is coming up a lot more.
[01:15:45.469 --> 01:15:50.533]  It's just critical to remember that that's how we fund this operation and this has been the last day of the sale.
[01:15:50.553 --> 01:15:55.978]  But I want to thank you all for your support and for spreading the word about how we were right about Epstein and so much more.
[01:15:56.058 --> 01:16:02.484]  But we've got a lot to talk about with Mark Rondas on the other side because he's the lawyer that argued in front of the federal court.
[01:16:03.803 --> 01:16:14.706]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[01:16:15.246 --> 01:16:17.787]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:16:18.147 --> 01:16:21.108]  No one can doubt that InfoWars has changed the world.
[01:16:21.648 --> 01:16:27.830]  The globalists give us credit for discrediting their world government system, their neoliberal fascist plan,
[01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:34.955]  And infecting, in their words, the entire world with nationalism.
[01:16:34.975 --> 01:16:36.756]  Now, how did I do that?
[01:16:37.917 --> 01:16:39.017]  I did that because of you.
[01:16:39.598 --> 01:16:40.158]  We did that.
[01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:41.199]  You did that.
[01:16:41.219 --> 01:16:43.921]  We're either going to have freedom or we're going to have slavery.
[01:16:44.621 --> 01:16:48.084]  And these corporatists play nation states off against each other.
[01:16:48.644 --> 01:16:50.065]  They play men and women off against each other.
[01:16:50.085 --> 01:16:52.707]  They play people off against each other for what color their skin is.
[01:16:53.748 --> 01:16:56.910]  But the people of the world, more and more, are seeing through it.
[01:16:57.964 --> 01:17:16.116]  And that's why I want all of you right now, as the world government falls apart, as the New World Order hits the panic button and tries to start a race war, to realize that we have come so far, and that all these globalists have now is trying to stir up internal information warfare fights.
[01:17:17.116 --> 01:17:23.561]  But we knew history, and knew that these globalists are arrogant, and there would come a time when their system
[01:17:24.551 --> 01:17:32.584]  Would enter a crisis when it actually tried to implement its incredibly anti-human agenda.
[01:17:33.626 --> 01:17:36.611]  You know I don't spend valuable time on air.
[01:17:37.876 --> 01:17:49.523]  Showing you the infrastructure here, showing you what goes into it, showing you how much money it costs to run this and do this, especially since we were de-platformed one year ago today.
[01:17:49.543 --> 01:17:56.048]  That's why we're calling it the one-year anniversary of the first domino to be unpersoned, to be sent into a black hole, the Phantom Zone.
[01:17:56.108 --> 01:17:58.069]  But the globalists did it too early.
[01:17:58.369 --> 01:18:05.534]  There's still talk radio, there's still TV, there's still independent websites like Infowars.com and Newswars.com that are on the air.
[01:18:06.694 --> 01:18:17.660]  And people have word of mouth to say, hey, just because you can't say Alex Jones's name on Facebook unless it's a negative statement or can't show InfoWars.com, you can tell your office about InfoWars.com.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.061]  You can tell your neighbors about NewsWars.com.
[01:18:20.702 --> 01:18:22.663]  You can share our videos and our articles.
[01:18:22.683 --> 01:18:23.383]  We have our own site.
[01:18:23.403 --> 01:18:24.163]  We have our own platform.
[01:18:25.364 --> 01:18:27.825]  That's the beauty of what's happening here.
[01:18:27.865 --> 01:18:31.067]  That's the beauty of what's unfolding.
[01:18:31.767 --> 01:18:32.828]  And it's a real fight.
[01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:39.301]  And things aren't going to go the way this whole synthetic technocracy want them to go, because you've been standing in the gap.
[01:18:40.101 --> 01:18:41.022]  You've been spreading the word.
[01:18:41.582 --> 01:18:42.222]  You've been praying.

[01:19:16.101 --> 01:19:20.522]  Every time you put a bumper sticker on your car or paintinfowars.com on the side of your barn.
[01:19:20.682 --> 01:19:22.243]  Every time you stand up to leftist police.
[01:19:22.403 --> 01:19:23.603]  Every time you tell the truth.
[01:19:23.763 --> 01:19:28.264]  Every time you keep this symbol of free speech and pro-human values alive.
[01:19:28.284 --> 01:19:31.324]  The enemy comes one step closer to their system falling.
[01:19:31.484 --> 01:19:35.085]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[01:19:35.885 --> 01:19:39.966]  And now we've got a fighting chance if we all take action of defeating the globalists.
[01:19:40.366 --> 01:19:40.826]  Stay with us.
[01:19:41.046 --> 01:19:41.627]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:41.647 --> 01:19:43.287]  But please take advantage of the sale.
[01:20:06.833 --> 01:20:09.450]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.078 --> 01:20:28.101]  Also interesting to remember, it's illegal to possess these stolen documents.
[01:20:28.141 --> 01:20:29.141]  It's different for the media.
[01:20:29.161 --> 01:20:32.043]  So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us.
[01:20:32.303 --> 01:20:36.004]  And in full disclosure, let's take a look at what is in there and what it means.
[01:20:36.044 --> 01:20:42.688]  Talking about Epstein, you gotta stick to what is common sense on these things, alright?
[01:20:42.988 --> 01:20:49.851]  Don't get buried in legalese, don't follow the finger pointing, and please don't get caught up in the intrigue of who was better friends with this guy.
[01:20:49.971 --> 01:20:50.652]  Who cares?
[01:20:52.935 --> 01:20:57.278]  Yeah, who cares who flew on airplanes with underage girls and children?
[01:20:57.298 --> 01:21:00.880]  Who cares if smugglers reportedly brought really young kids into the island?
[01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:03.781]  Who cares if it was a giant international blackmail ring?
[01:21:04.362 --> 01:21:06.503]  I appreciate Mark Rondazza coming on with us.
[01:21:07.003 --> 01:21:10.745]  I was having a technical difficulty earlier, didn't know you were there until the end of the segment.
[01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:11.326]  I apologize.
[01:21:11.746 --> 01:21:15.088]  But you are an Italian-American, also an Italian citizen.
[01:21:15.108 --> 01:21:17.189]  A lot of time I talk to you, you're in Italy.
[01:21:17.469 --> 01:21:18.750]  You founded an Italian
[01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:20.010]  Language school.
[01:21:20.331 --> 01:21:23.332]  So you were particularly ticked off by this Cuomo thing.
[01:21:23.632 --> 01:21:28.234]  Now there's an interview on Infowars.com where he referred to himself as Fredo.
[01:21:28.794 --> 01:21:35.677]  So this whole race baiting thing where everything's racism is now extending to calling him Fredo.
[01:21:35.697 --> 01:21:46.902]  What do you make of this, Mark Rondazza, constitutional lawyer, First Amendment lawyer, who of course is really here because you with Mike Cernovich got the huge 2,000 page bombshell document.
[01:21:48.928 --> 01:21:52.712]  You know, I hate fake race baiting to try to shut down debate.
[01:21:53.573 --> 01:21:58.198]  I really hate it when it's done in my vowel at the end of my name name.
[01:21:58.698 --> 01:22:09.149]  You know, and as far as Chris Fredo Cuomo goes, I think I've got much more Italian cred than he does and there is not a shred of any support.
[01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:15.845]  For the thought that calling somebody Fredo is somehow a slight on them for being Italian-American.
[01:22:15.865 --> 01:22:21.449]  I mean, I don't really think that the Godfather that Don Corleone is a great figure to live up to.
[01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:24.211]  I don't respect that kind of thing.
[01:22:24.952 --> 01:22:30.476]  But, you know, when somebody calls James Brown the Godfather of soul, I think they certainly are not insulting him.
[01:22:30.956 --> 01:22:33.318]  But Chris Cuomo, he is the dumb son.
[01:22:33.918 --> 01:22:35.679]  He is the nitwit of the Cuomo family.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.661]  So I think he is Fredo.
[01:22:38.522 --> 01:22:43.163]  So, you know, Chris Cuomo really, I think, made a screw-up if you watch that video.
[01:22:43.894 --> 01:22:46.915]  Man, that guy should sue him for assault.
[01:22:47.055 --> 01:22:48.595]  He's got a great claim against him.
[01:22:49.876 --> 01:23:03.259]  I would love to see that happen, because if that had happened to anybody else, you know, in any other circumstance, if those tables had been turned, you bet Chris Cuomo would be screaming that somebody had assaulted him or made threats against him.
[01:23:03.499 --> 01:23:08.741]  So, you know, Cuomo, you know, sedzito, if you even know what that means.
[01:23:08.861 --> 01:23:09.621]  It means shut up.
[01:23:12.663 --> 01:23:16.667]  Wow, why do you think he's so arrogant and just exploded this guy?
[01:23:16.767 --> 01:23:18.589]  And CNN is even defending it now.
[01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:20.091]  YouTube took the video down.
[01:23:20.131 --> 01:23:21.072]  It's now back up.
[01:23:21.712 --> 01:23:23.794]  And they're still sticking with it.
[01:23:24.215 --> 01:23:26.097]  No, this guy set a racial epithet.
[01:23:26.137 --> 01:23:31.702]  So we now agree with Cuomo running into him, bumping him, saying, I'll wreck you.
[01:23:31.742 --> 01:23:32.723]  I'll throw you downstairs.
[01:23:32.743 --> 01:23:34.305]  I mean, is that not a terroristic threat?
[01:23:36.317 --> 01:23:39.698]  It's not a terroristic threat, but it is a threat of assault.
[01:23:39.758 --> 01:23:45.941]  I mean, assault is when you put someone in imminent fear that there's going to be bodily harm.
[01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:48.042]  I mean, that guy, you saw that guy.
[01:23:48.062 --> 01:23:53.604]  I mean, Cuomo was picking on the guy who was, you know, not quite looking like he was there for a physical altercation.
[01:23:53.964 --> 01:23:59.206]  I mean, I think what the guy did, I think bothering people when they're out with their family is not all that cool.
[01:24:00.007 --> 01:24:02.908]  But, you know, Cuomo, I get a funny feeling that
[01:24:03.528 --> 01:24:05.690]  His dad must have called him Fredo or something.
[01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:12.875]  And, you know, as far as I'm concerned, Mario Cuomo, I know it's not going to be popular with a lot of your viewers, but I think he was a great American.
[01:24:12.915 --> 01:24:15.157]  I think Chris Cuomo ought to be proud that that was his dad.
[01:24:15.878 --> 01:24:20.221]  And then Chris Cuomo ought to get off the air and do something that's a little more suited to his intellect.
[01:24:20.301 --> 01:24:24.404]  Like, you know, I don't know.
[01:24:24.684 --> 01:24:29.168]  I could use somebody to pick up the garbage out in front of my house on Monday mornings when the foxes get into it.
[01:24:31.044 --> 01:24:32.265]  Okay, the really big news here.
[01:24:32.305 --> 01:24:33.466]  It's not a racial epithet.
[01:24:33.886 --> 01:24:35.207]  It's not a racial attack.
[01:24:35.367 --> 01:24:40.911]  And it's it's just it's disgusting that that he's trying to play that card.
[01:24:41.211 --> 01:24:48.456]  I think it's it's beneath any normal person's pride when they play it from the side of the traditional victims.
[01:24:48.816 --> 01:24:49.797]  Let me tell you something.
[01:24:50.477 --> 01:24:59.063]  As an Italian American, if there's anything that racial bias or or prejudice does,
[01:24:59.875 --> 01:25:00.896]  It helps us.
[01:25:00.956 --> 01:25:06.319]  We are the one group of people in America who's got no right to complain about bias.
[01:25:06.379 --> 01:25:07.120]  Because you know what?
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:12.943]  When I sit down at a date, hell, I'm already halfway in bed with the girl because of the vowel at the end of my name.
[01:25:13.163 --> 01:25:15.385]  You know, the pre-expectations about us, what?
[01:25:15.405 --> 01:25:18.286]  We're great lovers, we know how to cook, and we know how to live life.
[01:25:18.707 --> 01:25:19.787]  You have a problem with that?
[01:25:20.028 --> 01:25:23.690]  Then give up the vowel at the end of your name and be Chris Cuom or Fredo Cuom.
[01:25:24.491 --> 01:25:28.917]  I just don't want to hear this from anybody out there who's Italian that they've been oppressed.
[01:25:29.198 --> 01:25:29.839]  Get over it.
[01:25:31.601 --> 01:25:33.985]  Marco Dozzo, what do you think his new nickname should be?
[01:25:34.005 --> 01:25:39.874]  I mean, I'm thinking like Fredo Cuomo or just CNN's Fredo, or what do you call him?
[01:25:40.717 --> 01:25:50.483]  I mean, you know, it's almost an insult to the Fredo character to compare this guy to him because, you know, he's actually sort of, you know, I like that clip that you showed.
[01:25:50.523 --> 01:25:57.388]  That's my favorite demonstrative clip of Chris Cuomo when he gets up there on CNN and tries to tell people.
[01:25:58.143 --> 01:26:05.165]  That it's illegal for them to have documents that CNN got a hold of, but it's okay for him to have them.
[01:26:05.245 --> 01:26:06.986]  So, you know, what's a good name for him?
[01:26:07.366 --> 01:26:12.067]  Look, I love, everybody should call him Fredo just because it's such a rise out of him.
[01:26:12.387 --> 01:26:13.467]  Forget Fredo Cuomo.
[01:26:13.507 --> 01:26:16.788]  It's an insult to the Cuomo name, the way that that guy's such a clown.
[01:26:17.228 --> 01:26:18.989]  Just plain old Fredo.
[01:26:20.788 --> 01:26:30.873]  Now, Mark, Mark, I know you've got to go soon, but if you can even do five minutes into the next segment or however much time you've got, because you with Mike Cernovich got a big.
[01:26:33.534 --> 01:26:34.094]  Losing audio.
[01:26:36.755 --> 01:26:42.338]  Yeah, we've been having some technical difficulties that that's part of it when you're on the road and part of that going on Houston.
[01:26:42.358 --> 01:26:43.799]  Do I get a thumbs up from folks in Houston?
[01:26:44.739 --> 01:26:45.639]  We're good with Houston.
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:48.861]  I really wanted Rondaza on.
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:27:02.887]  Today about the fact that they sued with Mike Cernovich to get documents pertaining to Epstein with an end run by being involved in another suit that was there.
[01:27:03.227 --> 01:27:11.711]  And they got these latest documents implicating world leaders, British royal family, you name it, inside
[01:27:12.403 --> 01:27:12.803]  I don't
[01:27:24.969 --> 01:27:27.611]  He said, hey man, I'm pissed off about this whole Fredo thing.
[01:27:27.651 --> 01:27:28.712]  That guy is a Fredo.
[01:27:28.732 --> 01:27:30.193]  I want to come on and talk about that.
[01:27:30.673 --> 01:27:34.076]  And so I know we've already spent now 45 minutes on this.
[01:27:34.116 --> 01:27:39.400]  We've got China invading Hong Kong and we've got Trump saying it's a very serious situation.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.743]  Proxy wars going on with India and Pakistan and China.
[01:27:43.303 --> 01:27:44.704]  We've got the economic war going on.
[01:27:44.724 --> 01:27:46.706]  We got Trump with his draft executive order.
[01:27:47.626 --> 01:27:48.347]  Go after big tech.
[01:27:49.671 --> 01:27:54.993]  Censorship, but we've got so many other big guests waiting in the wings that are coming on the show today.
[01:27:55.073 --> 01:27:59.495]  And we've got Owen Schroeder that's been sitting there patiently while I've been babbling.
[01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:02.136]  What are some of the things you're going to be covering, Owen?
[01:28:02.156 --> 01:28:04.137]  Because we're going to have you co-host coming up here soon.
[01:28:05.336 --> 01:28:08.558]  Well, we'll go over some of the latest developments in the Epstein thing.
[01:28:08.578 --> 01:28:10.980]  We're going to take calls in the fourth hour.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:15.762]  I'll be hosting the fourth hour today, so we're just going to take people's calls to see what the latest there is.
[01:28:16.403 --> 01:28:24.568]  I think it's fair to say at this point, I mean, still a lot of questions remain, a lot of gray area, but I think it's pretty much 100% certain at this point there was an inside job.
[01:28:25.088 --> 01:28:27.069]  Again, whether you want to say good fourths, bad fourths,
[01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.771]  Outside forces.
[01:28:29.151 --> 01:28:30.473]  Clearly though, inside job.
[01:28:30.493 --> 01:28:33.656]  It took somebody inside this facility to pull this off.
[01:28:34.177 --> 01:28:36.419]  And you know, we'll look at the Hong Kong news.
[01:28:36.439 --> 01:28:39.623]  We've got some other crazy news going on where they're trying to sexualize the kids as usual.
[01:28:39.643 --> 01:28:42.586]  But Alex, I'll say this in closing for the Cuomo thing.
[01:28:43.487 --> 01:28:45.128]  This is what really stuck out to me about this.
[01:28:45.148 --> 01:28:47.049]  I mean, you've had coffee poured on you.
[01:28:47.089 --> 01:28:48.350]  You've had people threaten your family.
[01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:50.011]  I mean, you see the videos of how they treat me.
[01:28:50.631 --> 01:28:56.054]  Never, ever once, with all the disgusting treatment have we received, have we ever threatened anybody?
[01:28:56.154 --> 01:28:58.115]  Or have you ever tried to get violent?
[01:28:58.155 --> 01:29:01.878]  So, really, that is the difference here between people like that and us.
[01:29:03.018 --> 01:29:05.019]  There's a war on our children.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:09.702]  Because predators know that a child is defenseless.
[01:29:10.422 --> 01:29:11.003]  That a child
[01:29:12.759 --> 01:29:16.862]  We'll be embarrassed when they get abused or hurt and a lot of times won't report it.
[01:29:17.983 --> 01:29:37.478]  And I remember three years ago when the Boy Scouts of America that I was part of, since I was a Cub Scout, good wholesome Americana institution, was handing out condoms at their World Jamboree and encouraging promiscuous sex, whether it was heterosexual or homosexual, that's pedophilia, that's criminal.
[01:29:38.138 --> 01:29:40.100]  Well now it's come out in big press conferences
[01:29:41.115 --> 01:29:52.962]  That there are thousands of protected pedophiles in the Boy Scouts of America who came there to use that great institution as a place to target our children, like shooting fish in a barrel.
[01:29:54.282 --> 01:30:04.108]  And we've seen the National Library Association say they are now places for drag queen story time, where men dress as clowns, many of them sexual offenders, rapists.
[01:30:06.468 --> 01:30:17.279]  Disguised themselves as It the Clown and come and mothers as a sacrament to evil bring their little babies and sit them on their lap and simulate, well you know what?
[01:30:18.821 --> 01:30:26.549]  Even here in Austin, Texas, recently they're having city council meetings about this and these groups are going and targeting children.
[01:30:26.829 --> 01:30:27.209]  Sometimes
[01:30:28.488 --> 01:30:36.410]  Unannounced at public schools, on career day, men disguised as women come and tell the children you could be a topless dancer at a gay bar.
[01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:38.291]  And now new articles.
[01:30:38.351 --> 01:30:41.812]  Drag Queen shows children how to twerk during story hour.
[01:30:42.112 --> 01:30:44.292]  Just move your bum up and down.
[01:30:45.693 --> 01:30:46.373]  Shake your booty.
[01:30:47.253 --> 01:30:50.074]  If a man did this to your child in a park, you'd say, get the hell away.
[01:30:51.007 --> 01:30:55.371]  If a man talked about your son or daughter's booty and told them they were another sex, they'd get arrested.
[01:30:55.851 --> 01:31:04.559]  But because it's done sanctioned by the state and sanctioned by these institutions, oh well it's okay because no one wants to call it out for what it is.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.542]  But here at InfoWars, we are calling it out for what it is.
[01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:11.745]  And you know who the enemy is by who you can't speak about.
[01:31:14.417 --> 01:31:16.779]  We had Facebook and Twitter before we got banned over a year ago.
[01:31:16.919 --> 01:31:18.240]  We even recorded these conversations.
[01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:19.821]  We're going to do a report on them soon.
[01:31:19.861 --> 01:31:25.206]  Saying, look, do whatever you want, just don't talk about Islam and don't talk about the trans movement.
[01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:29.970]  We said, well, we're not against people if a man wants to try to be a woman or vice versa, but leave kids alone.
[01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:32.412]  Well, that's what we get banned for.
[01:31:32.432 --> 01:31:34.753]  So I'm proud that I stand up against predators.
[01:31:35.214 --> 01:31:40.138]  I'm proud that Infowars stands up against these people that are there, whether they know it or not.
[01:31:41.698 --> 01:31:46.462]  We're grooming and recruiting and preparing children to be abused.
[01:31:46.482 --> 01:31:49.384]  And a lot of them get up and say, oh, we're here to groom your children.
[01:31:49.784 --> 01:31:51.326]  We're here to prepare them for their new life.
[01:31:51.886 --> 01:31:52.747]  And we're going to do it.
[01:31:53.928 --> 01:31:58.751]  My God, ladies and gentlemen, you wouldn't let the Army try to recruit your five-year-old, even though the Army's good overall.
[01:31:59.012 --> 01:32:00.433]  Still, that's, they're five.
[01:32:00.533 --> 01:32:01.654]  They need to make that decision when they're 18.
[01:32:03.035 --> 01:32:06.417]  This is about what sex they want to be, or to be chemically castrated.
[01:32:06.758 --> 01:32:10.621]  This is the most hardcore child abuse the world could ever imagine.
[01:32:11.738 --> 01:32:14.019]  So we've made a bold stand, and we're reaching a lot of people.
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:18.442]  But without you supporting us, we won't reach new people.
[01:32:18.542 --> 01:32:20.824]  It's only through word-of-mouth now that we're able to get out.
[01:32:21.104 --> 01:32:25.186]  Via email, via text message, via person-to-person, for people to learn about InfoWars.com.
[01:32:27.569 --> 01:32:32.112]  And it's only by you going to M4WarsTore.com with this big sale that's got to end in just a few days.
[01:32:32.132 --> 01:32:37.876]  50-60% off, shore-wide free shipping, double patriot points, and getting staples and products you need that we're able to be here.
[01:32:38.396 --> 01:32:40.738]  So we want to continue to fight, and thank you for your support.
[01:32:40.978 --> 01:32:43.500]  But without your support, the enemy's going to win.
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:44.641]  So please, commit now.
[01:32:44.901 --> 01:32:53.046]  Go to M4WarsTore.com and get some great products you already need for your family and know that you're standing against the true spirit of Satan that's attacking our youth.
[01:32:53.387 --> 01:32:54.407]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:32:54.768 --> 01:32:56.689]  Thank you for holding M4Wars in your hand.
[01:33:06.329 --> 01:33:14.798]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.139 --> 01:33:21.646]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:31.585 --> 01:33:34.728]  Well, I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, the energy of what's happening in the world.
[01:33:34.828 --> 01:33:39.111]  Trump's saying he's going to take executive order action on censorship and so much more.
[01:33:39.151 --> 01:33:39.712]  It's amazing.
[01:33:39.772 --> 01:33:46.137]  I'm going to hand the baton to Owen Schroer and, of course, to Mark Randazza in this segment for the big issue.
[01:33:46.837 --> 01:33:54.523]  The 2,000 pages that he went and argued in court for, for Mr. Cernovich, why this is so important.
[01:33:54.904 --> 01:33:57.366]  The media really isn't getting into the names that are in there.
[01:33:57.686 --> 01:33:58.847]  These are incredible names.
[01:33:59.822 --> 01:34:01.753]  And why these documents are so bombshell.
[01:34:02.115 --> 01:34:03.502]  Then I want to get Ron Dazza's take.
[01:34:04.506 --> 01:34:11.547]  On what he thinks about Trump's draft that was leaked to CNN so far to counter big tech censorship.
[01:34:11.567 --> 01:34:13.808]  So I want to thank both of them for being here today.
[01:34:13.908 --> 01:34:17.828]  Owen doing a great job, the crew doing a great job as we cover all this information.
[01:34:17.848 --> 01:34:29.650]  I want to remind listeners the only way we reach new people with the total media blackout, the censorship, is by you telling people about InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:29.891 --> 01:34:31.751]  When you share the articles, you share the videos.
[01:34:31.771 --> 01:34:32.351]  We're going to post
[01:34:32.951 --> 01:34:42.915]  All this information today after it's live up in different video sections, so you can get it out to everyone you know via your own instant message, via your own text message, via your own email.
[01:34:43.255 --> 01:34:47.997]  Those are some of the few areas we're still able to get stuff out, but now Microsoft and Apple are announcing
[01:34:49.598 --> 01:34:58.823]  And others in Facebook that on your personal text apps, they're reading and watching what you say, humans are reading and watching, and they're not going to let you say certain things or do things now.
[01:34:59.164 --> 01:35:02.565]  This is beyond 1984, it's wrong, and we have to say no.
[01:35:02.826 --> 01:35:06.768]  So those are all topics Mark Randazzo is an expert on, constitutional lawyer, that you can speak to.
[01:35:06.808 --> 01:35:14.552]  But first, Mark, the huge developments with the 2,000 pages that the media dare not get into, and Epstein's death, and all the questions.
[01:35:14.993 --> 01:35:17.314]  You've got the floor, and of course your co-pilot now,
[01:35:17.654 --> 01:35:17.895]  My pleasure.
[01:35:23.061 --> 01:35:28.822]  Yeah, you know, these documents, there was a mighty, mighty effort to keep them quiet.
[01:35:29.843 --> 01:35:37.125]  First, it was one side wanted them closed, then the other side, then the sides switched sides when we got to the appeals point.
[01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:43.786]  Then at the appeals court, there were other parties who came in who never disclosed who they were.
[01:35:44.206 --> 01:35:50.288]  They came in as anonymous parties who wanted to work to keep these documents under wraps.
[01:35:50.968 --> 01:35:58.189]  And, you know, once they came out, I mean, I still haven't been able to look through all 2,000 pages of them, and I'm sure most of the press hasn't even done that.
[01:35:58.670 --> 01:36:02.730]  But we're seeing a lot of names come out that, frankly, are somewhat shocking to me.
[01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:08.872]  New Mexico former governor and then former ambassadors.
[01:36:09.032 --> 01:36:10.732]  I mean, I am really kind of shocked.
[01:36:11.152 --> 01:36:16.333]  Now, remember, we have to remember, and this is the thing I'm really glad that the Court of Appeals did.
[01:36:17.093 --> 01:36:27.799]  The Court of Appeals took a very unusual step in their order of admonishing the press that when they get these documents, it doesn't mean that any of it's true.
[01:36:28.359 --> 01:36:31.180]  These are accusations levied by Ms.
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:41.866]  Giuffre, which they might be true, they might not be true, but a couple of things that did come out in them that you can see in black and white in the documents, you know, there's been this
[01:36:43.038 --> 01:36:50.260]  There's been this accusation that Alan Dershowitz was one of the people who engaged in relations with her.
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:37:01.283]  And if you look at the documents, it seems that his name didn't get floated until it was by a journalist who said, yeah, you were probably with him.
[01:37:01.883 --> 01:37:03.644]  So it didn't originate with her.
[01:37:03.664 --> 01:37:06.245]  Now, she's claiming this is true today.
[01:37:06.405 --> 01:37:08.865]  So, you know, again, I really don't know.
[01:37:08.886 --> 01:37:10.466]  I have a hard time believing it.
[01:37:11.095 --> 01:37:25.562]  But when I see something like that, where I see a journalist essentially plant its scenes to be planting the idea of someone to accuse in the accuser's mind, I've got a problem with that.
[01:37:26.442 --> 01:37:39.569]  Maybe there's something else that shows something else on that, but Mr. Dershowitz has been pretty adamant about his denial, as has former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, as have everybody else involved.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:38:01.525]  When we look at all of this and then we just, you know, maybe it's maybe, you know, coincidence, maybe conspiracy, but it seems really, really bizarre that the day after the documents all come out, you know, the suicide prevention techniques that are supposed to be employed at the prison are not employed.
[01:38:02.405 --> 01:38:10.067]  This guy was on suicide watch and then they take him off without following proper procedures and he just happens to wind up dead and now
[01:38:10.836 --> 01:38:22.318]  You know, we're not ever going to know what he has to say, but when you think about it, you know, he had, he got a sweetheart deal, you know, something that I just couldn't imagine anyone else getting.
[01:38:22.818 --> 01:38:29.460]  He had a business empire built on blackmail and, uh, you know, he had every incentive to stay quiet.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:35.761]  Well, when he's now facing the rest of his life in jail, I think his incentive to stay quiet goes away.
[01:38:36.576 --> 01:38:39.478]  And then he mysteriously winds up suiciding himself.
[01:38:39.939 --> 01:38:41.720]  Or, you know, maybe not.
[01:38:43.281 --> 01:38:50.207]  You know, I really think that this is a scandal that should be investigated, should be reported on, should have been reported on before.
[01:38:50.227 --> 01:39:01.336]  I think if we, if you remember, the whole history of digging into these documents started when, you know, the summary judgment motions were filed and everything was under wraps.
[01:39:02.615 --> 01:39:11.444]  And of all the journalists that should have been looking at that, and especially hometown newspapers in New York, I mean, CNN is right there in New York.
[01:39:12.064 --> 01:39:13.606]  New York Times is right there in New York.
[01:39:14.707 --> 01:39:15.968]  They didn't bother to look at it.
[01:39:16.028 --> 01:39:21.934]  They didn't bother to go in and do what the press almost always does, and that is to say that the courts have to be open to the people.
[01:39:22.498 --> 01:39:37.160]  No, it took Mike Cernovich coming in from California to do it, and then, to their credit, eventually the Miami Herald did show up as well, and we were glad for that, because Mike's a small operator, and his ability to sustain the protracted battle that this was
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:38.240]  We're good to go.
[01:40:00.532 --> 01:40:09.878]  You know, you got to look at when you see something like this under wraps like that, when it's a public figure involving people at the highest levels of government, potentially.
[01:40:09.898 --> 01:40:21.146]  I mean, when you've got, heck, you know, it at least implicated or the story implicated, the relationship implicated people on the Republican and the Democrat side.
[01:40:21.787 --> 01:40:23.188]  I want to know what the heck is going on.
[01:40:24.048 --> 01:40:27.911]  And I just got to ask why anybody else didn't want us to know.
[01:40:28.672 --> 01:40:29.672]  Who didn't want us to know?
[01:40:29.853 --> 01:40:31.173]  What didn't they want us to know?
[01:40:31.293 --> 01:40:35.435]  And what are they keeping quiet now with Mr. Epstein being quiet?
[01:40:36.095 --> 01:40:37.636]  You know, I really don't know.
[01:40:38.036 --> 01:40:40.677]  But these are things that every American should be asking.
[01:40:41.238 --> 01:40:42.618]  Because this doesn't just happen.
[01:40:42.638 --> 01:40:49.781]  I mean, I just, I don't, I don't sign on to very many theories that say something is a conspiracy.
[01:40:50.542 --> 01:40:52.342]  I'm pretty skeptical when I hear that.
[01:40:53.223 --> 01:40:55.344]  I like coincidence more than conspiracy.
[01:40:55.384 --> 01:40:55.744]  But here,
[01:40:56.579 --> 01:40:57.500]  I just don't see it.
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:04.586]  You know, when you have all this quiet and you've got this federal judge who, you know, he didn't die under mysterious circumstances.
[01:41:04.646 --> 01:41:09.991]  The federal judge who initially, I think, made the error, you know, he wasn't even buying green bananas.
[01:41:10.031 --> 01:41:10.712]  He was so old.
[01:41:10.892 --> 01:41:18.058]  So, you know, the fact that he passed away of natural causes while in office did not raise much of a concern with me.
[01:41:18.679 --> 01:41:18.839]  But
[01:41:19.605 --> 01:41:31.508]  Why on earth this judge did something that I have never seen a judge do before, and that is allow the parties to simply designate something as confidential, and then keep them from the public eye.
[01:41:33.088 --> 01:41:40.249]  You know, I don't want to speak ill of the dead, and I don't want to impugn his character, but I would like to know just what he was thinking.
[01:41:40.329 --> 01:41:44.550]  And, you know, unfortunately, because of nature, we're just not going to know what he was thinking.
[01:41:45.610 --> 01:41:47.831]  And because of Epstein's death, we're not going to know
[01:41:48.630 --> 01:41:50.192]  At least his side of the story.
[01:41:50.332 --> 01:42:02.426]  And I just wonder how many rich and powerful people from wherever all over the world could have been very deeply embarrassed by what Mr. Epstein had to say.
[01:42:02.446 --> 01:42:05.990]  And all we really have to work on right now is this 2,000 pages of documents.
[01:42:08.246 --> 01:42:13.090]  And already, already they're at least showing us some things that we didn't think we knew.
[01:42:14.751 --> 01:42:22.337]  At the very least, there are people who were accusing Trump of being involved sexually with her, which the documents seem to have disproven.
[01:42:23.198 --> 01:42:31.724]  These documents seem to show that she claims that Trump flirted with her, but never had any sexual relations with her.
[01:42:31.924 --> 01:42:37.909]  Well, I mean, I know that's going to disappoint a lot of people on the left, but the truth is the truth.
[01:42:38.610 --> 01:42:40.191]  Now I want to know the rest of the truth.
[01:42:40.772 --> 01:42:41.292]  And so should you.
[01:43:05.194 --> 01:43:09.217]  When you finance what we're doing, you're not just funding the Second American Revolution.
[01:43:10.599 --> 01:43:12.200]  You're changing world destiny.
[01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:16.684]  And there's so much fake stuff out there in a million different voices, and I understand that.
[01:43:17.144 --> 01:43:22.288]  But we really are in the zeitgeist, and we try to make it easy to get good products at the same time.
[01:43:22.368 --> 01:43:25.531]  But I can just tell you point blank, you cannot invest in a place
[01:43:25.731 --> 01:43:28.712]  Better than Infowars for human liberty and a pro-human future.
[01:43:28.772 --> 01:43:34.494]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[01:43:34.534 --> 01:43:37.015]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[01:43:37.215 --> 01:43:39.716]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[01:43:39.736 --> 01:43:42.657]  We have fish oil, children's fish oil, and Ultimate Krill Oil.
[01:43:42.797 --> 01:43:43.918]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[01:43:44.298 --> 01:43:53.947]  And it is the strongest, purest fish oil, krill oil, and it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[01:43:54.087 --> 01:43:59.812]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[01:43:59.852 --> 01:44:02.215]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[01:44:02.375 --> 01:44:03.075]  This has not been.
[01:44:03.396 --> 01:44:05.638]  We went to one of the top firms in the world that
[01:44:06.078 --> 01:44:07.920]  Private labels, fish oil and krill oil.
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:09.702]  And we simply want the best you make.
[01:44:09.942 --> 01:44:10.182]  Period.
[01:44:10.202 --> 01:44:11.704]  I want to show people this krill oil.
[01:44:11.804 --> 01:44:16.148]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere.
[01:44:16.248 --> 01:44:17.730]  This is thermonuclear right here.
[01:44:18.090 --> 01:44:18.671]  It's red.
[01:44:18.831 --> 01:44:20.893]  This is real krill oil, folks.
[01:44:20.933 --> 01:44:21.333]  It's red.
[01:44:21.353 --> 01:44:21.994]  It's not yellow.
[01:44:22.454 --> 01:44:23.175]  It's not milky.
[01:44:23.335 --> 01:44:24.877]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[01:44:25.017 --> 01:44:26.557]  And by the way, I'm not hyping this, folks.
[01:44:26.757 --> 01:44:29.518]  This is the best krill oil we could find.
[01:44:29.558 --> 01:44:30.738]  This is the best.
[01:44:30.799 --> 01:44:32.099]  I can't even just look at that.
[01:44:32.219 --> 01:44:35.060]  It's supposed to be red, folks, because that's the essence of the krill.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:37.720]  I mean, there's probably like 100 krill going to each one of these.
[01:44:37.940 --> 01:44:41.421]  And again, I'm not going to call this a drug, because drugs are a ripoff of what God made.
[01:44:41.701 --> 01:44:44.162]  You take two of these before you go to bed at night.
[01:44:44.322 --> 01:44:46.323]  I would do it with your dinner if you don't want to get fish burps.
[01:44:46.363 --> 01:44:47.503]  Because again, I've got the fish oil.
[01:44:47.523 --> 01:44:47.783]  It's like, oh!
[01:44:48.183 --> 01:44:50.747]  This doesn't have the fish flavor, because they boiled the hell out of it.
[01:44:50.787 --> 01:44:52.329]  It isn't there anymore, folks.
[01:44:52.409 --> 01:44:53.671]  You gotta deal with the fish burps.
[01:44:53.951 --> 01:44:54.713]  This stuff's powerful.
[01:44:54.753 --> 01:44:55.514]  Just look at that.
[01:44:55.614 --> 01:44:57.737]  Can a camera pick up just how pretty those are?
[01:44:57.917 --> 01:44:59.440]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:12.538 --> 01:45:20.943]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:45:21.564 --> 01:45:31.389]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:45:31.650 --> 01:45:40.155]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:45:41.015 --> 01:45:41.956]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:45:42.336 --> 01:45:43.377]  You must experience it.
[01:45:43.497 --> 01:45:45.398]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:45:45.458 --> 01:45:49.841]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:45:50.501 --> 01:45:51.962]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:45:52.022 --> 01:45:53.023]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:45:53.503 --> 01:45:59.647]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:46:00.188 --> 01:46:01.689]  TurboForce at MForceLife.com.
[01:46:02.970 --> 01:46:15.901]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[01:46:16.141 --> 01:46:18.684]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[01:46:19.064 --> 01:46:20.165]  farming goods a week ago.
[01:46:20.825 --> 01:46:24.469]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:29.032]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[01:46:29.653 --> 01:46:30.233]  That's beautiful.
[01:46:30.714 --> 01:46:32.255]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[01:46:32.595 --> 01:46:33.616]  And we aren't going to back down.
[01:46:34.216 --> 01:46:41.562]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:46:41.802 --> 01:46:43.764]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[01:46:44.124 --> 01:46:48.007]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:46:48.168 --> 01:46:49.228]  And I'm asking listeners,

[01:47:43.575 --> 01:47:46.615]  I'm going to be joined by Hotep Jesus coming up in the next hour.
[01:47:46.635 --> 01:47:48.576]  Before I get Mark Randazza back on here,
[01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:51.151]  We may have only one day left.

[01:49:11.661 --> 01:49:14.342]  So, here's where we're at, Mark Randazza.
[01:49:15.843 --> 01:49:30.491]  We're supposed to believe in a series of coincidences between security guards not being on duty, being off duty, replacement security guards, camera malfunction, suicide watch removed,
[01:49:33.132 --> 01:49:37.555]  Then they go, apparently people are hearing shrinking, breathe Epstein, breathe!
[01:49:38.075 --> 01:49:39.977]  Like out of a soap opera or something.
[01:49:40.797 --> 01:49:52.405]  And then after the whole thing, they have, and I don't even know if I'm buying this, it almost feels like it's staged, or if they really did it, you have to scratch your head and wonder how incompetent these people are.
[01:49:52.825 --> 01:49:55.727]  The FBI finally raids Epstein Island.
[01:49:55.787 --> 01:50:00.750]  Wow, really, after you gave how many people how many months to go clean it out, and believe me, they did.
[01:50:00.791 --> 01:50:02.372]  I mean, they sent in basically
[01:50:04.273 --> 01:50:10.660]  I mean, it's like they could have exhumed anything and everything.
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:11.741]  The electronics were removed.
[01:50:11.761 --> 01:50:13.923]  So, here's where I'm at, Mark.
[01:50:13.943 --> 01:50:20.951]  Still a lot of questions, but I think with what we know, and let's get your take on things where we're at right now, basically with what we know,
[01:50:22.788 --> 01:50:24.510]  This had insider elements.
[01:50:24.570 --> 01:50:30.455]  Somebody inside this facility had to pull all of these switches to allow this to happen.
[01:50:30.495 --> 01:50:32.156]  It had to be a multiple-man job.
[01:50:32.256 --> 01:50:34.018]  There was no way it was one man that did this.
[01:50:34.658 --> 01:50:36.960]  And so, to me, I'm sitting here saying, wow.
[01:50:37.861 --> 01:50:46.249]  We either have some powerful dark forces that can pull something like this off right in front of everyone's face and then have the media lie about it,
[01:50:47.265 --> 01:50:51.147]  Or, wow, we've reached a point where things are so serious.
[01:50:51.807 --> 01:50:53.788]  I mean, this is, again, I think it could go either way.
[01:50:53.808 --> 01:51:04.273]  I think most people think he's dead, but did they do a dead man switch, put him into witness protection as he's basically turning over all the documents and cooperating with this investigation?
[01:51:05.313 --> 01:51:07.434]  I think, you know, still a lot of questions.
[01:51:07.474 --> 01:51:09.655]  The media is going to continue to tell us 1 plus 1 equals 3.
[01:51:10.396 --> 01:51:11.876]  And if you don't believe that, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:51:11.916 --> 01:51:15.258]  But where are you at with all the information we have right now, Mark Randazzo?
[01:51:17.025 --> 01:51:27.675]  You know, I'm just a natural skeptic, so I'm still willing to believe that this is just an incredible example of incompetence and coincidence.
[01:51:28.516 --> 01:51:32.359]  I'm also willing to believe that this was an inside job.
[01:51:32.539 --> 01:51:40.747]  I'm willing to believe anything because, you know, but right now I just think there are too many coincidences for it just to be simple incompetence.
[01:51:41.588 --> 01:51:42.188]  It might be.
[01:51:42.448 --> 01:51:49.691]  You know, there are a lot of people who wind up in American prisons who ought to be watched, who aren't, who wind up dead.
[01:51:50.191 --> 01:51:56.533]  There are a lot of really incompetent and stupid things that happen in our prison system.
[01:51:57.233 --> 01:52:06.736]  But I gotta imagine that if I'm anywhere in the command structure at this prison, and I know I've probably got the highest value
[01:52:08.095 --> 01:52:12.578]  Domestic asset that's been arrested in quite some time.
[01:52:13.258 --> 01:52:17.441]  Certainly one of the highest value suspects that he's had in that jail.
[01:52:17.501 --> 01:52:23.104]  I mean this guy is higher on the list than John Gotti who managed to survive until the end of his natural life.
[01:52:23.804 --> 01:52:29.087]  You know he's sitting in that cell and you're not asking for every single thing to be perfect.
[01:52:29.207 --> 01:52:31.529]  You're not saying everybody watch this guy.
[01:52:32.490 --> 01:52:41.335]  You know, I'd really like to start seeing the people who are in command at that jail brought before some committees and have a full investigation.
[01:52:42.396 --> 01:52:45.118]  You also, you know, you pointed out this raid on the island.
[01:52:45.138 --> 01:52:55.204]  I mean, I've seen these drone pictures where it appears that in one picture he's got all these computers on the desktop and then by the time the raid starts everything's gone.
[01:52:55.224 --> 01:52:59.026]  You know, I would like to know where the heck everything went.
[01:53:00.005 --> 01:53:02.947]  And what exactly he's got hidden somewhere.
[01:53:03.007 --> 01:53:14.996]  Because, you know, a guy like him, when you look at his financial history, there's at least stories that say that he just couldn't have made that kind of money doing what he was doing.
[01:53:15.276 --> 01:53:24.863]  And he had some very questionable deals that nobody could quite explain, you know, how he'd managed to sell a piece of real estate at such a high price, for example.
[01:53:25.732 --> 01:53:29.078]  And there's at least speculation surrounding that.
[01:53:29.279 --> 01:53:31.983]  Well, this guy was making blackmail money.
[01:53:32.003 --> 01:53:37.593]  You know, he's got to have a little black book somewhere that he hid for his own protection.
[01:53:38.183 --> 01:53:40.946]  And I'd be very curious to know what's happened to that.
[01:53:41.446 --> 01:53:52.036]  Now that picture you just showed, that might debunk at least one of the pictures I've seen, because I've seen a photograph that was specifically saying that that computer gear disappeared.
[01:53:52.596 --> 01:53:58.342]  It showed one drone picture showing that picture, showing that computer on the desktop, and then the next one showed it gone.
[01:53:58.762 --> 01:54:01.865]  You just showed it wrapped in pink plastic with an officer there, so
[01:54:02.734 --> 01:54:09.678]  You know, I think one thing we've got to be careful of also is falling victim to how many different conspiracy theories could come out.
[01:54:09.698 --> 01:54:13.260]  I mean, there is just, it's such fertile ground for it.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:18.363]  This is just so perfect for any possible speculation to be true.
[01:54:19.484 --> 01:54:26.748]  And I just don't see anybody yet really doing a deep dive on this, really doing a good job of showing us what the heck's going on.
[01:54:27.128 --> 01:54:32.411]  Yeah, that Macintosh that's there, I recall seeing something that looked like that.
[01:54:33.397 --> 01:54:36.761]  Uh, on, on a before picture and then an after picture.
[01:54:36.821 --> 01:54:42.126]  So, you know, maybe that didn't disappear, but how in the heck does this happen?
[01:54:42.507 --> 01:54:48.793]  I mean, how does it happen where this guy is already apparently tried to kill himself?
[01:54:49.591 --> 01:54:53.215]  I mean, just right there, let's step away from the governmental involvement.
[01:54:53.255 --> 01:54:54.457]  Let's step away from all of this.
[01:54:54.497 --> 01:55:03.467]  I mean, let's just look at the fact that even if this guy just killed himself out of despair, which I think anybody could imagine, anybody could understand,
[01:55:05.495 --> 01:55:10.060]  You know, think about the nameless people that are sitting right now in jail cells.
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:14.205]  Think about the people who do kill themselves when they should be on suicide watch in our jails.
[01:55:14.225 --> 01:55:19.791]  I mean, that's just, you know, that's somewhat getting buried in all the political intrigue of this, but...
[01:55:20.464 --> 01:55:24.348]  You know, our jails are just a disgrace for a first world country.
[01:55:24.949 --> 01:55:28.233]  And that's at least something willing, you know, that should be looked at.
[01:55:28.273 --> 01:55:38.344]  I mean, heck, you'd think the liberal press would be at least looking at that, saying, you know, if Jeffrey Epstein can't be kept safe from himself, you know, no wonder Sandra Bland wound up dead.
[01:55:38.384 --> 01:55:40.687]  Well, I think part of that is just the prison, you know,
[01:55:41.067 --> 01:55:52.780]  The prison system has become an industry, and we've kind of gotten away from that old school mentality where it's literally like, I mean, if I'm Attorney General Barr, like, I've got Epstein shackled to my ankle.
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:55.463]  Or like, you know, latched up to my bed or something.
[01:55:55.503 --> 01:55:56.804]  Like, he's not leaving my sight.
[01:55:57.084 --> 01:55:57.365]  Yeah.
[01:55:57.605 --> 01:56:02.971]  But it's so industrialized now, you know, it's so packed up that they have to run it this way.
[01:56:04.454 --> 01:56:06.538]  I mean, I gotta say, Mark, I have no doubt.
[01:56:06.558 --> 01:56:09.523]  I mean, this is not a coincidence.
[01:56:09.563 --> 01:56:13.670]  I mean, come on, what are you talking about?
[01:56:13.690 --> 01:56:15.373]  1% chance, coincidence, incompetence?
[01:56:15.453 --> 01:56:16.395]  I mean, this is a hit job.
[01:56:17.737 --> 01:56:22.579]  Listen, if you're going to ask me to bet my retirement on something, I'm not betting it on coincidence.
[01:56:22.879 --> 01:56:24.300]  So yes, I'm with you on that.
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:28.621]  But let me ask you this as a lawyer who's dealt with stuff like this before.
[01:56:28.661 --> 01:56:30.962]  Was it odd the timing of the raid?
[01:56:30.982 --> 01:56:39.626]  Because they already raided his New York estate and they got a bunch of stuff there, like wild stuff, like holy smokes.
[01:56:40.526 --> 01:56:40.967]  We're good to go.
[01:56:55.437 --> 01:57:14.890]  I find it strange because you know if I mean you see videos every day of some low-level weed dealer sitting on the couch and then armed cops bash down his door and raid the place to save save the Republic from the grave sin of a bag of plants that might get you high.
[01:57:15.411 --> 01:57:21.294]  Meanwhile, this is conducted in such a lackadaisical and we'll get to it when we get to it way.
[01:57:21.535 --> 01:57:21.895]  Yeah.
[01:57:21.975 --> 01:57:24.857]  Yeah, I find that really unusual really bizarre.
[01:57:25.317 --> 01:57:31.619]  Yeah, and I think more than anything, and there's the pictures again, it was August 1st when there were construction crews out there doing who knows what.
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:35.741]  Here's the big thing, the big takeaway from all the details.
[01:57:35.821 --> 01:57:37.942]  The American people are demanding answers, Mark.
[01:57:38.462 --> 01:57:42.504]  And I don't think they're going to be able to brush this thing under the rug with the mainstream media saying 1 plus 1 equals 3.
[01:57:43.404 --> 01:57:50.667]  I think the American people see 1 plus 1 does not equal 3, and the media is lying to us, telling us it does, and then telling us to shut up.
[01:57:50.687 --> 01:57:51.267]  Something's wrong here.
[01:57:52.588 --> 01:57:53.568]  This is not a drill.
[01:57:53.788 --> 01:57:55.949]  Everybody knows who Donald Trump is.
[01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.769]  Donald Trump.
[01:57:57.029 --> 01:57:57.610]  Donald Trump.
[01:57:57.810 --> 01:57:58.370]  Donald Trump.
[01:57:58.490 --> 01:58:00.311]  We have to let him know who we are.
[01:58:00.631 --> 01:58:07.253]  This has to be the party that's not afraid to say out loud, we're going to tax the hell out of the wealthy.
[01:58:07.533 --> 01:58:10.874]  Your estimated net worth is more than $65 million.
[01:58:11.774 --> 01:58:19.337]  That would make you subject to Senator Warren's proposed wealth tax on the assets of the richest 75,000 homes, households or so in the United States.
[01:58:19.557 --> 01:58:21.538]  And I'd like to finish talking about Eddie.
[01:58:21.939 --> 01:58:23.620]  The guy who has ALS.
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:25.161]  This isn't funny.
[01:58:25.181 --> 01:58:26.261]  It's not funny!
[01:58:26.281 --> 01:58:30.744]  The healthcare industry will be advertising tonight on this program.
[01:58:30.764 --> 01:58:31.285]  Thank you, Senator.
[01:58:31.305 --> 01:58:32.886]  Senator Warren, it's your turn.
[01:58:33.026 --> 01:58:34.167]  Oh, that's a big sponsor, isn't it?
[01:58:34.487 --> 01:58:35.468]  Or that whole class of drugs.
[01:58:35.488 --> 01:58:36.188]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:58:36.208 --> 01:58:37.889]  No, whoa, gotta cut that off, don't you?
[01:58:38.009 --> 01:58:42.532]  I think if we're gonna force Americans to make these radical changes, they're not gonna go along.
[01:58:42.572 --> 01:58:43.973]  You, uh, throw your hands up.
[01:58:44.133 --> 01:58:46.215]  But you, uh, you have an impact.
[01:58:46.515 --> 01:58:46.675]  Whoa-ho!
[01:58:46.695 --> 01:58:47.495]  I can do it!
[01:58:51.118 --> 01:58:52.880]  We're up here with makeup on our faces.
[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:54.762]  And the thing about predators is this.
[01:58:54.942 --> 01:58:56.423]  And our rehearsed attack lines.
[01:58:56.583 --> 01:58:59.146]  They prey on people they perceive to be weak.
[01:58:59.426 --> 01:59:01.308]  Playing roles in this reality TV show.
[01:59:01.588 --> 01:59:05.012]  They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable.
[01:59:05.312 --> 01:59:08.475]  It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president.
[01:59:08.635 --> 01:59:10.497]  Predators are cowards.
[01:59:10.998 --> 01:59:12.559]  I am not afraid.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.323]  And for Democrats to win, you can't be afraid either.
[01:59:16.403 --> 01:59:19.767]  We don't need a liberal or progressive with big ideas.
[01:59:20.027 --> 01:59:22.930]  We need a mass political movement.
[01:59:23.291 --> 01:59:28.116]  Or we don't need a moderate who can win back Trump-Obama voters.
[01:59:28.436 --> 01:59:32.759]  I'm as progressive as anybody up on this stage, but I'm also pragmatic.
[01:59:33.079 --> 01:59:34.480]  You need someone who can do both.
[01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:37.521]  We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.
[01:59:38.082 --> 01:59:40.863]  I really do believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time.
[01:59:41.143 --> 01:59:43.365]  We have to walk and chew gum at the same time.
[01:59:43.385 --> 01:59:43.645]  Go to Joe 30330.
[01:59:43.685 --> 01:59:46.406]  Let's end this three ring circus.
[01:59:46.426 --> 01:59:46.927]  Adios!
[01:59:54.901 --> 01:59:58.986]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.487 --> 02:00:00.809]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:04.343 --> 02:00:06.905]  Epstein, the elite's pedophile pimp, is dead.
[02:00:07.205 --> 02:00:15.650]  Something everyone saw coming a mile away, including Epstein himself, who according to the Daily Mail had told guards that someone was trying to kill him.
[02:00:15.930 --> 02:00:29.378]  An ex-inmate told the New York Post that it would have been impossible for Epstein to kill himself, yet there is still no way to tell because the staff at MCC is yet to say anything, even though the incident is of grave national importance.
[02:00:29.798 --> 02:00:35.145]  When it comes to any American harboring a shred of trust in the government again.
[02:00:35.285 --> 02:00:45.098]  We are told Epstein, hanging onto life and soon to suffer cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital, was wheeled out of New York City's Metropolitan Correctional Center around 7.30 a.m.
[02:00:46.420 --> 02:01:05.005]  Just a day after co-conspirators had been revealed in 2015 court documents and 2016 depositions where Virginia Jeffrey, who told the Mail on Sunday that Epstein loaned her out to the high-profile people, a claim that she had to report back with details relating to blackmail.
[02:01:05.265 --> 02:01:19.210]  Giffrey also revealed how Epstein's Madame Ghislaine Maxwell pimped Giffrey out to powerful names for erotic massages and sex, which included modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel and wealthy financer Glenn Dubin.
[02:01:19.450 --> 02:01:28.634]  In those released documents, Dubin's butler recounted the testimony of a Swedish teen who had been held against her will on Epstein's notorious pedo island.
[02:01:28.934 --> 02:01:30.495]  She said they asked me for sex.
[02:01:30.935 --> 02:01:31.595]  I said no.
[02:01:31.995 --> 02:01:34.136]  The butler was asked, was she in fear?
[02:01:34.756 --> 02:01:35.676]  Yes, he replied.
[02:01:36.156 --> 02:01:36.777]  You could tell?
[02:01:37.097 --> 02:01:37.457]  Yes.
[02:01:37.877 --> 02:01:39.497]  She was shaking uncontrollably.
[02:01:39.578 --> 02:01:45.760]  While modeling agent Brunel was accused of supplying Russian teens that didn't speak a word of English.
[02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:49.041]  Signs of an international sex trafficking network.
[02:01:49.281 --> 02:01:56.163]  Of course, we are supposed to believe the Clinton cleanup crew over at the FBI is on top of it, and the Justice Department.
[02:01:56.463 --> 02:02:02.486]  And why did former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein pop up at the outset of all of this anyway?
[02:02:02.546 --> 02:02:09.288]  Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein suggested on Twitter that there might not be more here beneath the surface.
[02:02:09.368 --> 02:02:13.530]  He wrote, Pedophiles facing criminal charges are at high risk for suicide.
[02:02:13.930 --> 02:02:18.112]  It happened in several of my Maryland cases when defendants were released on bail.
[02:02:18.472 --> 02:02:21.153]  Detained pedophiles require special attention.
[02:02:21.634 --> 02:02:24.615]  Stopping people from harming themselves is difficult.
[02:02:24.895 --> 02:02:34.160]  But as Cassandra Fairbanks at the Gateway Pundit reported, there aren't any mainstream media outlets at MCC asking the same questions she is.
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.822]  Do you know why Epstein wasn't on Suicide Watch?
[02:02:37.842 --> 02:02:38.303]  I do not know.
[02:02:38.323 --> 02:02:40.884]  Do you know if they're going to do a press conference?
[02:02:40.904 --> 02:02:41.244]  I do not know.
[02:02:41.264 --> 02:02:43.326]  You'll have to talk to the public information officer.
[02:02:43.426 --> 02:02:45.567]  I've been trying, but I haven't been able to get through.
[02:02:46.107 --> 02:02:52.232]  Questions like, were the guards that were stationed to watch Epstein told to leave the area due to maintenance?
[02:02:52.753 --> 02:02:58.197]  Why did the security cameras mysteriously break during the time of the alleged suicide?
[02:02:58.357 --> 02:03:00.619]  Why is there a bruise on Epstein's face?
[02:03:01.019 --> 02:03:03.501]  And how did Epstein die exactly?
[02:03:03.962 --> 02:03:06.424]  Also, is the case actually over?
[02:03:06.664 --> 02:03:13.950]  If the reports are true, keep in mind these are co-conspirators of his, and they have complained.
[02:03:14.739 --> 02:03:22.027]  So if the complainants aren't focused now on Epstein as he's dead, they're going to focus on anybody else that was involved.
[02:03:22.087 --> 02:03:31.518]  And if those other guys were involved, and I'm not saying they were, but according to reports, if that's true, then the investigation just shifts over to them.
[02:03:31.818 --> 02:03:36.382]  It could be made to look like a suicide when it was something else, and I've handled cases like that.
[02:03:36.422 --> 02:03:36.802]  You have?
[02:03:37.002 --> 02:03:37.403]  Yes.
[02:03:37.763 --> 02:03:39.104]  They look like a suicide and they're not?
[02:03:39.224 --> 02:03:41.706]  Oh, they set the cases up to make it look like a suicide.
[02:03:41.746 --> 02:03:42.147]  In jail?
[02:03:43.148 --> 02:03:43.908]  In jails.
[02:03:44.409 --> 02:03:46.670]  I've had a couple in jail and outside of jail.
[02:03:46.911 --> 02:03:53.116]  And what I would always say to my staff is, until you can prove otherwise, any unattended death is a murder case.
[02:03:53.396 --> 02:03:55.898]  And didn't Ghislaine Maxwell aid in a bet?
[02:03:56.058 --> 02:03:58.000]  How long before she disappears?
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:00.762]  And ultimately, how deep does this go?
[02:04:00.982 --> 02:04:02.483]  Who did Epstein work for?
[02:04:02.703 --> 02:04:07.025]  His wealth and Saudi Arabian passport remain major mysteries.
[02:04:07.446 --> 02:04:19.013]  Sure, it's early, but the longer these questions go unanswered, the more the people responsible for the incompetence surrounding Epstein's death create their own undeniable conspiracy.
[02:04:19.393 --> 02:04:20.594]  John Bowne reporting.
[02:04:30.512 --> 02:04:37.095]  What is with that tweet from Rod Rosenstein and then Rosie O'Donnell's response?
[02:04:38.756 --> 02:04:44.619]  So a pedophile child sex trafficker offs himself and you're upset about that?
[02:04:44.719 --> 02:04:50.522]  I mean, I'm just... I don't know about that one.
[02:04:51.909 --> 02:04:52.811]  That's a little strange to me.
[02:04:52.831 --> 02:04:54.936]  Alright, Hotep Jesus is coming up on the other side.
[02:04:54.956 --> 02:04:56.379]  We'll get his take on the Epstein stuff.
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:04:58.984]  And then, uh, I bet you I could make him laugh.
[02:04:59.385 --> 02:05:00.608]  I bet you I'll make him laugh, too.
[02:05:00.648 --> 02:05:01.169]  That'll be funny.
[02:05:03.692 --> 02:05:05.974]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:05:06.375 --> 02:05:12.481]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:05:12.741 --> 02:05:14.462]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[02:05:14.703 --> 02:05:21.109]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.

[02:05:41.893 --> 02:05:46.919]  With powerful ingredients combined to help support the mind and body, Happies
[02:05:47.159 --> 02:05:47.660]  Watch me!
[02:06:13.036 --> 02:06:19.480]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:23.362]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:26.964 --> 02:06:31.387]  Alright, we're into the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:32.888 --> 02:06:35.349]  Potep Jesus is joining us now.
[02:06:35.469 --> 02:06:38.071]  He once got a free cup of coffee from Starbucks.
[02:06:38.531 --> 02:06:39.372]  We all remember that.
[02:06:40.669 --> 02:06:48.953]  And he's made a couple things go viral on Twitter, and Twitter hates him for it, but here he is with us today at Hotep Jesus.
[02:06:48.993 --> 02:06:52.274]  Before, I've promised the audience I'm going to make you laugh today.
[02:06:52.494 --> 02:06:57.376]  I think you're probably maybe the perfect guest to talk about this news with.
[02:06:57.496 --> 02:06:58.917]  It's just so ridiculous.
[02:06:59.857 --> 02:07:00.618]  But before we do that,
[02:07:01.661 --> 02:07:04.143]  What do you make of the Epstein story?
[02:07:04.283 --> 02:07:08.065]  I mean, we've got enough to start to form some theories.
[02:07:08.105 --> 02:07:09.286]  You can call them conspiracy theories.
[02:07:09.306 --> 02:07:10.787]  Well, what else are you gonna do?
[02:07:10.947 --> 02:07:16.591]  They don't tell us the truth, so what, we're just gonna sit here and just accept a lie and just live our lives like that's acceptable?
[02:07:16.971 --> 02:07:17.292]  Uh, no.
[02:07:18.032 --> 02:07:19.813]  So what do you think is going on here?
[02:07:19.933 --> 02:07:22.194]  What do you think the response has been from America?
[02:07:22.234 --> 02:07:25.916]  Do you think they're going to get away with this cover-up of Jeffrey Epstein?
[02:07:25.956 --> 02:07:29.698]  Not just how he died, but the whole industrial-level pedophile network he was running.
[02:07:29.738 --> 02:07:30.918]  That's the real cover-up here.
[02:07:31.438 --> 02:07:33.119]  Hotep Jesus, do you think they're going to get away with this?
[02:07:34.220 --> 02:07:34.960]  Absolutely!
[02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:36.861]  Football season's about to start back up.
[02:07:37.401 --> 02:07:38.662]  Nobody cares about Epstein.
[02:07:42.264 --> 02:07:46.926]  People are arguing about how much that Prescott is going to be paid.
[02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:50.681]  I mean, the distractions have been in abundance.
[02:07:50.721 --> 02:07:54.622]  Yeah, wasn't there like a football player that said he wanted to play without a helmet or something?
[02:07:54.642 --> 02:07:57.062]  Yeah, it's a lot of distractions.
[02:07:57.102 --> 02:08:04.904]  The day of Epstein's alleged death, the Miley Cyrus breakup thing happened.
[02:08:04.944 --> 02:08:06.404]  I'm like, oh, this is convenient.
[02:08:06.564 --> 02:08:07.104]  Heartbreaking.
[02:08:08.205 --> 02:08:08.465]  Right?
[02:08:08.605 --> 02:08:09.985]  Like, we're supposed to care about that.
[02:08:10.565 --> 02:08:13.146]  Did you see Trump tweeted about that in 2013?
[02:08:13.186 --> 02:08:14.146]  Did you see that whole thing?
[02:08:15.186 --> 02:08:15.386]  What?
[02:08:16.627 --> 02:08:17.527]  Tweeted about, uh...
[02:08:18.001 --> 02:08:24.165]  Trump was traveling through time and he went back to 2013 and tweeted how he felt bad for Miley Cyrus' breakup.
[02:08:27.408 --> 02:08:28.568]  He hopped in his time machine.
[02:08:28.589 --> 02:08:31.390]  There you go, you made me laugh.
[02:08:31.991 --> 02:08:33.212]  I wasn't even trying with that one.
[02:08:33.492 --> 02:08:35.734]  But you know, sadly, sadly though, I think you're right.
[02:08:35.854 --> 02:08:39.616]  But I guess that's kind of the, I guess this is kind of the tipping point, right?
[02:08:39.636 --> 02:08:42.999]  Where it's like, are we going to have America kind of fall back in line of
[02:08:44.148 --> 02:08:47.230]  Oh, you know, what did Miley Cyrus do for lunch now that she's single?
[02:08:47.290 --> 02:08:53.193]  And, uh, you know, what's, what's going to happen before the next NFL season starts or kind of the normal distractions?
[02:08:53.713 --> 02:08:55.394]  Or will America stay tuned to this?
[02:08:55.434 --> 02:08:56.215]  Be like, wait a second.
[02:08:56.735 --> 02:08:58.596]  There's that pedophile network that was being exposed.
[02:08:58.636 --> 02:08:59.537]  Anything ever happened to that?
[02:08:59.857 --> 02:09:01.898]  I mean, it's kind of a tipping point right now.
[02:09:03.099 --> 02:09:07.221]  Uh, I mean the hoi polloi are entranced in a stupor.
[02:09:07.887 --> 02:09:11.248]  Controlled by the ruling elite, the socialists run this whole thing.
[02:09:11.308 --> 02:09:17.609]  And the problem is, people aren't even intelligent enough to know what to do from here.
[02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:22.051]  I mean, we saw that there was agreeance for the first time in forever.
[02:09:22.071 --> 02:09:26.532]  The left and the right agreed that there's something fishy going on with this Epstein death.
[02:09:27.992 --> 02:09:30.933]  But like we said on Hotep's Been Told You, me and Uncle Hotep was talking about it.
[02:09:30.953 --> 02:09:31.313]  We said,
[02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:34.841]  Like, he asked me, he said, yo, you think he's gonna get away?
[02:09:34.861 --> 02:09:37.382]  Do you think he's gonna make it to trial?
[02:09:37.842 --> 02:09:41.904]  And he asked me that because he knew what I was gonna say, because I was gonna agree with him.
[02:09:42.084 --> 02:09:43.524]  No, he wasn't gonna make it to trial.
[02:09:43.544 --> 02:09:44.465]  That's what we assumed.
[02:09:44.925 --> 02:09:49.947]  And I said in that same episode, I said, yo, I think they're gonna pull the body double stunt, right?
[02:09:50.527 --> 02:09:59.411]  Cameras are off, prison guard ain't smooth, isn't really a correctional officer, all these different, you know, whatever, whatever.
[02:10:00.134 --> 02:10:04.177]  I mean, it's so fishy, but it's like, is the public really gonna unite?
[02:10:04.197 --> 02:10:14.284]  Or what I've been seeing is this has actually reignited the war between the left and the right, because now we're arguing, is it Trump's guy or is it Clinton's guy, right?
[02:10:14.464 --> 02:10:17.427]  Instead of, can we find out who's on his list?
[02:10:17.467 --> 02:10:18.928]  Can we do a full investigation?
[02:10:19.188 --> 02:10:23.931]  Then they went down to his island and ransacked that.
[02:10:23.951 --> 02:10:28.995]  You mean to tell me nobody ran to the island and put a couple of things in their pocket when nobody was looking?
[02:10:30.307 --> 02:10:31.008]  Come on, man.
[02:10:31.088 --> 02:10:32.329]  It's a lot of things that's going on.
[02:10:32.589 --> 02:10:34.450]  The whole island thing is a distraction.
[02:10:34.690 --> 02:10:36.772]  You ran down there to start the investigation?
[02:10:38.753 --> 02:10:40.274]  The death happened in New York.
[02:10:40.314 --> 02:10:43.176]  Why is the investigation happening on his property?
[02:10:43.217 --> 02:10:44.998]  Y'all could have been went down there and got his property.
[02:10:46.739 --> 02:10:50.822]  Well, and it's all getting even more complex now with the family.
[02:10:50.842 --> 02:10:54.645]  And genuinely, the family might not have any clue either.
[02:10:54.785 --> 02:10:57.607]  And so they might genuinely, because they're the ones that hired that famous
[02:10:59.011 --> 02:11:01.912]  That famous guy to do the autopsy who's done JFK and all these other things.
[02:11:03.153 --> 02:11:07.855]  And they want to say, oh, because they're worried now that this might affect the estate that they were supposed to inherit.
[02:11:08.295 --> 02:11:10.636]  So there's all kinds of weird stuff going on right now.
[02:11:10.676 --> 02:11:14.997]  We can't forget about the royalty over the pond that would also want Epstein dead.
[02:11:15.898 --> 02:11:17.779]  So it's really just wacky, wild stuff.
[02:11:17.839 --> 02:11:18.719]  And you have to say,
[02:11:19.693 --> 02:11:26.878]  If this is a, one percent chance, a case of incompetence, then I mean, we've got something else that we have to look at.
[02:11:27.258 --> 02:11:35.484]  But to me, this is a case where, I mean, there should be investigations happening to every person that was on the scene that night.
[02:11:35.845 --> 02:11:36.765]  Every single one of them.
[02:11:36.865 --> 02:11:44.591]  Their bank accounts, their activities, their spending, I mean, literally everything, because there's no way he could commit suicide.
[02:11:44.831 --> 02:11:45.372]  We know that.
[02:11:46.434 --> 02:11:53.560]  And based on all the coincidences, there had to be at least one or two men on the inside to pull this whole thing off.
[02:11:54.841 --> 02:11:55.141]  Mm-hmm.
[02:11:55.902 --> 02:11:58.023]  I saw James Bond enough to know how this is done.
[02:11:58.864 --> 02:12:04.889]  Yeah, but you saw James Bond before it was a transsexual, transracial dinosaur.
[02:12:07.110 --> 02:12:08.171]  The new James Bond.
[02:12:08.271 --> 02:12:10.573]  You didn't hear?
[02:12:10.653 --> 02:12:10.893]  What?
[02:12:11.594 --> 02:12:12.835]  The new James Bond is supposed to be a woman.
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:16.584]  Yeah, I know, but next it'll be a transsexual dinosaur problem.
[02:12:17.345 --> 02:12:18.907]  Just to really keep things interesting.
[02:12:18.927 --> 02:12:21.430]  I mean, more than likely, absolutely.
[02:12:21.651 --> 02:12:27.078]  I saw today that they're teaching LGBT in an Illinois public school.
[02:12:29.208 --> 02:12:43.317]  And there's almost like, so but that's like the behind the scenes thing, it's like as this pedophile network is being exposed, one of probably dozens, this is getting exposed, and then the background is like, drag queen story time for kids, love has no age.
[02:12:43.817 --> 02:12:47.900]  Uh, Bebe Rexha, a pop artist, tweeted out today that any age can be sexy.
[02:12:47.940 --> 02:12:53.443]  I'm like, wait a second, are you guys trying to tell us like, oh there's no problem with the pedophile island, it's cool.
[02:12:54.713 --> 02:12:59.575]  The planet is run by androgynous reptilian shapeshifters.
[02:13:02.177 --> 02:13:03.137]  There it is, right there.
[02:13:03.878 --> 02:13:04.618]  Come on, Media Matters.
[02:13:04.678 --> 02:13:06.299]  Alex Jones was right all along.
[02:13:06.899 --> 02:13:10.361]  When he was talking about what Alex Jones said, the gay frogs, right?
[02:13:11.321 --> 02:13:13.823]  And what David Icke said, he said it was lizard people, right?
[02:13:15.964 --> 02:13:24.308]  So, maybe what these people are tapping into, this intelligence that these people are tapping into, might have some validity.
[02:13:25.310 --> 02:13:25.632]  You know?
[02:13:26.377 --> 02:13:27.886]  Well, I think there's no doubt, I mean...
[02:13:29.130 --> 02:13:35.733]  Look, nobody covered and talked about pedophile networks and Epstein and all the involvement, like Infowars did.
[02:13:35.793 --> 02:13:36.293]  Nobody did.
[02:13:36.333 --> 02:13:37.474]  Most people were too scared.
[02:13:37.494 --> 02:13:45.617]  I mean, again, I'm not saying, I'm not even making a claim about Alan Dershowitz and whatever potential involvement or lack thereof, but of course he wouldn't want to talk about it.
[02:13:45.657 --> 02:13:47.438]  Of course people around him wouldn't want to talk about it.
[02:13:47.478 --> 02:13:49.379]  I mean, nobody would want to talk about this.
[02:13:49.399 --> 02:13:56.162]  They're all connected and that big pile of blackmail is just sitting out there and they don't know what, you know, they don't know what could come of it.
[02:13:56.182 --> 02:13:57.783]  So I think it's kind of like, okay, you don't touch it.
[02:13:58.652 --> 02:13:59.652]  Now here we are, they say.
[02:14:00.893 --> 02:14:01.453]  But here's the thing.
[02:14:01.473 --> 02:14:07.335]  How can they do this where they say 1 plus 1 equals 3, and then it's like, you're not even allowed to question this.
[02:14:08.235 --> 02:14:10.116]  You're not even allowed to say how did this happen.
[02:14:10.136 --> 02:14:12.857]  You're not even allowed to look at the events and say, no, this couldn't be.
[02:14:13.217 --> 02:14:15.658]  They say, oh, it's 1 plus 1 equals 3.
[02:14:15.698 --> 02:14:20.799]  The New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS, nothing to see here.
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:25.101]  Anybody that questions what we tell you is just a conspiracy theorist and dangerous.
[02:14:27.395 --> 02:14:30.356]  It's scary, but we're run by the Fabians.
[02:14:30.976 --> 02:14:32.977]  The Fabians run this whole show.
[02:14:33.577 --> 02:14:34.818]  The Trilaterals.
[02:14:35.038 --> 02:14:36.058]  The CFRs.
[02:14:36.598 --> 02:14:38.019]  They're the ones running the show.
[02:14:38.059 --> 02:14:41.860]  We keep looking at the White House and all these other entities.
[02:14:42.220 --> 02:14:44.281]  The Founding Fathers already told you who it was.
[02:14:44.301 --> 02:14:48.443]  You study Andrew Jackson, he'll tell you what time it was.
[02:14:50.964 --> 02:14:51.984]  Orwell warned us.
[02:14:54.403 --> 02:14:55.164]  It is what it is.
[02:14:55.184 --> 02:14:58.346]  Now they're digitally burning books too.
[02:14:58.426 --> 02:14:59.246]  They're banning books.
[02:14:59.547 --> 02:15:01.988]  So, but the whole world is really changing.
[02:15:02.789 --> 02:15:08.473]  The only way to take complete control of something is to centralize power.
[02:15:09.353 --> 02:15:13.556]  And in our country, what we have is centralization of power.
[02:15:13.636 --> 02:15:18.759]  We recognize the power of the media and we look at the media and we see that the media is centralized.
[02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:20.841]  We find our culprits.
[02:15:22.048 --> 02:15:28.632]  If we look at our monetary system and we find that our money is centralized, we find our culprit.
[02:15:28.892 --> 02:15:34.175]  If we look at our TV and movies and we find that that's centralized, we have found our culprit.
[02:15:34.315 --> 02:15:35.776]  And those culprits are in cahoots.
[02:15:36.877 --> 02:15:40.139]  But that's the same stuff that keeps the people distracted.
[02:15:40.159 --> 02:15:40.559]  You get it?
[02:15:42.062 --> 02:15:45.726]  And then again, if you question it, or, or, or, you don't even have to question it.
[02:15:45.766 --> 02:15:48.069]  At this point, you just lay out basic facts.
[02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:50.872]  And they'll say, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:15:50.913 --> 02:15:52.815]  It's like, uh, no I'm not.
[02:15:53.135 --> 02:15:54.557]  Epstein could not have committed suicide.
[02:15:54.657 --> 02:15:55.118]  Shut up.
[02:15:55.638 --> 02:15:56.759]  I saw it on TV.
[02:15:57.500 --> 02:16:01.145]  And the FBI said you're a terrorist because you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:16:02.435 --> 02:16:07.457]  President Trump has reacted to Epstein's death in what is sadly a very unsurprising way.
[02:16:07.897 --> 02:16:09.678]  He is spreading a conspiracy theory.
[02:16:09.758 --> 02:16:16.041]  Tying the death of pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in prison to the president's former political rivals, the Clintons.
[02:16:16.201 --> 02:16:21.143]  The president retweeting a theory without evidence that implicates the Clintons in Epstein's death.
[02:16:21.423 --> 02:16:22.124]  Let that sink in.
[02:16:23.137 --> 02:16:28.162]  This would be like Gerald Ford or Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan claiming that LBJ had Kennedy killed.
[02:16:28.403 --> 02:16:34.990]  Now, the president is helping to spread an outrageous false story about Epstein's death being tied to the Clintons.
[02:16:35.230 --> 02:16:42.558]  Shortly after Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his jail cell, President Trump retweeted this video from a conservative commentator.
[02:16:43.103 --> 02:16:48.126]  For some odd reason, people that have information on the Clintons end up dead.
[02:16:48.666 --> 02:16:50.647]  And they usually die from suicide.
[02:16:50.667 --> 02:16:51.667]  It's appalling.
[02:16:51.968 --> 02:16:55.189]  I mean, there's no other way to put it.
[02:16:55.249 --> 02:17:03.934]  You have the President of the United States retweeting an unfounded conspiracy theory with no evidence to back it up.
[02:17:04.594 --> 02:17:06.956]  About a former president of the United States.
[02:17:07.016 --> 02:17:12.320]  We have a president now whose Twitter feed is a chief source of disinformation.
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:23.508]  This is another example of our president using this position of public trust to attack his political enemies with unfounded conspiracy theories.
[02:17:23.528 --> 02:17:26.130]  Some extraordinary conspiracy theories.
[02:17:26.170 --> 02:17:27.231]  Conspiracy theories.
[02:17:27.251 --> 02:17:27.912]  Conspiracy theories.
[02:17:27.952 --> 02:17:29.012]  Conspiracy theories.
[02:17:29.052 --> 02:17:30.393]  Conspiracy theories.
[02:17:30.414 --> 02:17:31.494]  Conspiracy theories.
[02:17:31.554 --> 02:17:32.395]  Conspiracy theories.
[02:17:32.535 --> 02:17:37.756]  Three untrustworthy and ridiculous, baseless conspiracy theories.
[02:17:37.796 --> 02:17:45.898]  The President of the United States is pushing a dangerous and completely unfounded murder conspiracy theory about his predecessor.
[02:17:45.958 --> 02:17:47.058]  But do you think it's dangerous?
[02:17:47.098 --> 02:17:48.478]  What he's doing is dangerous.
[02:17:48.598 --> 02:17:51.319]  Republican Marco Rubio agrees it's dangerous.
[02:17:51.399 --> 02:17:52.199]  It's dangerous.
[02:17:52.259 --> 02:17:53.639]  Danger is my middle name.
[02:17:53.679 --> 02:17:57.280]  Dangerously claiming that Epstein was murdered by the Clintons?
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:01.844]  But there is no evidence at all to support the conspiracy theory the president is fueling.
[02:18:02.044 --> 02:18:09.211]  Marco Rubio says there is evidence Russian bots are now pushing this new conspiracy theory online to further divide Americans.
[02:18:09.452 --> 02:18:15.738]  All three of us, if we tweeted stuff like this in this reckless fashion, we would likely lose our jobs.
[02:18:41.914 --> 02:18:49.396]  Yeah, I really appreciate you, and it's an honor to talk to you, and I do, before I start, I also wanted to do a plug for a couple of your products that I really love.
[02:18:49.456 --> 02:18:50.116]  Changed my life.
[02:18:50.176 --> 02:18:52.637]  The DNA Force is one, and X2.
[02:18:52.677 --> 02:18:54.377]  Yeah, I do a lot of construction.
[02:18:54.577 --> 02:19:01.959]  Using the tools that you're using, it just really wreaks havoc on your body, and I had three of my fingers starting to go numb, and I didn't think there was anything going to work on it.
[02:19:02.059 --> 02:19:09.141]  I tried your DNA Force a couple weeks later, started feeling that numbness going away, tingling coming back, and then, you know, now I'm fully using my hand.
[02:19:09.181 --> 02:19:13.843]  It's great, and I can't thank you enough for what you do, just in the fight for liberty.
[02:19:13.883 --> 02:19:14.663]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:19:14.743 --> 02:19:16.264]  I mean, we want to sell you stuff that works.
[02:19:16.304 --> 02:19:22.846]  You want to order it again, but PQQ CoQ10 has been proven to make telomeres last longer, to make nerve regrow.
[02:19:23.006 --> 02:19:25.186]  It really is an amazing product for anybody above 40.
[02:19:25.426 --> 02:19:28.547]  Young people can take it as well, but yes, DNA Force Plus is amazing.
[02:19:29.108 --> 02:19:29.748]  What'd you think of the X2?
[02:19:30.268 --> 02:19:31.108]  I love that too.
[02:19:31.528 --> 02:19:35.369]  After a few months of being on that, I felt like I wasn't searching for words.
[02:19:35.969 --> 02:19:44.431]  There was a time in my life where I felt like, man, I don't know if I'm just too exhausted or what, but you feel like you want to get in a conversation and you're pausing and you can't find the word to say.
[02:19:44.571 --> 02:19:47.692]  And I swear, man, that X2 really helps with cognition.
[02:19:47.732 --> 02:19:50.492]  Well, that's because the synapses in the brain operate off of it.
[02:19:50.512 --> 02:19:51.232]  It's electrochemical.
[02:19:51.252 --> 02:19:51.992]  You're absolutely right.
[02:19:52.072 --> 02:19:55.773]  When I forget to take X2 every couple of days, sometimes I forget for like a week because I get busy.
[02:19:55.873 --> 02:19:58.414]  Then I feel it and I take it and it really is amazing.
[02:19:58.514 --> 02:19:59.674]  So thank you for the support, brother.
[02:20:05.825 --> 02:20:08.647]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:08.667 --> 02:20:20.513]  Alright, now this is the segment.
[02:20:29.068 --> 02:20:30.409]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:30.589 --> 02:20:31.490]  Owen Troyer filling in.
[02:20:31.530 --> 02:20:35.013]  This is the segment I told Hotef Jesus that I would make him laugh.
[02:20:35.814 --> 02:20:38.376]  So, I'm gonna do that right now.
[02:20:38.476 --> 02:20:48.846]  We talked about the Epstein craziness, but let's, uh, let's pivot here and just kind of look at the world and, because we tend to forget the cultural decay, the societal decay.
[02:20:49.787 --> 02:20:53.749]  And then we see mass shootings and all this tragic stuff, and we're like, oh, blame the gun, blame this.
[02:20:53.789 --> 02:20:57.750]  Well, let's look at society as a whole and say, hmm, maybe we're just degenerating.
[02:20:58.471 --> 02:21:01.352]  So I saw this story today on Yahoo News headline.
[02:21:01.912 --> 02:21:05.654]  Chlamydia vaccine shows promise in early tests.
[02:21:06.314 --> 02:21:17.659]  I'm sitting here thinking, so the whole thing is you're going to get a chlamydia vaccine, so you don't have chlamydia, they just give you a chlamydia vaccine, just add it to the dozens of vaccines we give kids now, giving them chlamydia, that's the next thing.
[02:21:18.179 --> 02:21:19.300]  And so I'm sitting here thinking, hmm,
[02:21:20.703 --> 02:21:25.030]  Why would we need a chlamydia vaccine?
[02:21:25.551 --> 02:21:26.533]  And then I saw this story.
[02:21:26.973 --> 02:21:31.220]  Drive-in sex booze proposed for Berlin's historic Tempelhof Airport.
[02:21:32.089 --> 02:21:32.189]  Ah!
[02:21:32.729 --> 02:21:35.650]  Now I see why we need a chlamydia vaccine.
[02:21:36.210 --> 02:21:47.632]  You know, we never talk about the cultural rot, the societal degeneracy, Hotep Jesus, and then we see tragic events like mass shootings or just political violence in the streets and we want to blame everything.
[02:21:47.812 --> 02:21:54.633]  Nobody wants to look internally as society as a whole and say, man, we've kind of turned into Sodom and Gomorrah here.
[02:21:55.193 --> 02:21:57.073]  You know, no wonder we're seeing all this stuff.
[02:21:59.554 --> 02:21:59.874]  Yeah.
[02:22:00.894 --> 02:22:04.236]  Um, you need a chlamydia vaccine if you're dealing with pedos.
[02:22:05.997 --> 02:22:08.398]  They must be preparing the kids for what they're about to do to them.
[02:22:09.619 --> 02:22:10.619]  Maybe that's what it is.
[02:22:10.879 --> 02:22:14.761]  What was that story you just read that you associated it with?
[02:22:14.781 --> 02:22:16.922]  I didn't hear that.
[02:22:17.243 --> 02:22:20.684]  The first story comes from a chlamydia vaccine story out of Yahoo News.
[02:22:20.824 --> 02:22:23.226]  It's actually coming out of Paris, France.
[02:22:24.746 --> 02:22:26.267]  Driving sex booths.
[02:22:26.327 --> 02:22:29.629]  And then, yeah, driving sex booths coming for Berlin's airport.
[02:22:31.386 --> 02:22:34.287]  Oh, debauchery on tilt.
[02:22:37.007 --> 02:22:46.809]  So yeah, if you go to Berlin now, well first you gotta fly to France, they'll hit you with the chlamydia vaccine, then you can fly to Berlin and hop in a sex booth and romp away.
[02:22:50.750 --> 02:22:52.090]  The new world, isn't it great?
[02:22:54.250 --> 02:22:55.610]  Yo, what's wrong with us?
[02:22:55.650 --> 02:22:56.971]  Yo, what's wrong with us?
[02:22:57.211 --> 02:22:58.811]  The people, what is...
[02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:02.823]  People, if you're listening, what are you doing?
[02:23:02.903 --> 02:23:09.889]  This is why Alex Jones needs to sell fallout gear, because we're not going to get it until it's time to fall out, man.
[02:23:12.010 --> 02:23:13.672]  Like, get your buffers, man.
[02:23:13.692 --> 02:23:16.374]  Get your buffers ready, because it's going down.
[02:23:16.494 --> 02:23:16.834]  I'm good.
[02:23:16.894 --> 02:23:21.999]  Yo, when they pull this, all this nuts and bolts shit you're talking about, I'm going underground, bro.
[02:23:22.019 --> 02:23:23.400]  I'm not dealing with this, bro.
[02:23:24.615 --> 02:23:28.718]  I'm going to Africa where, you know, they say Africa's like the new Wild Wild West.
[02:23:28.778 --> 02:23:30.959]  It's still uncharted territory out there.
[02:23:31.039 --> 02:23:37.303]  You can still, quote unquote, colonize something that hasn't been colonized yet.
[02:23:37.484 --> 02:23:40.265]  America, I see as being done.
[02:23:40.385 --> 02:23:42.087]  We're finito.
[02:23:42.847 --> 02:23:50.212]  In fact, Britain is further along in the communist socialist plot than we are, although we're complicit in the matter and we're
[02:23:51.042 --> 02:23:52.083]  Consumed by it all.
[02:23:53.023 --> 02:24:02.889]  But at this point, what we have to remember is that there's no middle class in a socialist society that is either going to be poor or the half, right?
[02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:13.115]  So it behooves everybody right now to get your shit together and start investing because it's about to go down.
[02:24:13.656 --> 02:24:17.098]  And if you're not well off, you're going to be poor.
[02:24:18.305 --> 02:24:19.307]  That just is what it is.
[02:24:20.228 --> 02:24:23.254]  And Yang Gang wants to make us poor with his UBI, right?
[02:24:23.274 --> 02:24:24.797]  He wants to give everybody money.
[02:24:24.817 --> 02:24:26.199]  He wants to increase the money supply.
[02:24:26.219 --> 02:24:27.281]  He wants to create inflation.
[02:24:30.040 --> 02:24:34.263]  Everybody that's on the left is of socialism.
[02:24:34.804 --> 02:24:36.025]  The right is no different.
[02:24:36.425 --> 02:24:37.606]  Socialism everywhere.
[02:24:37.626 --> 02:24:43.250]  Republicans have over 14 policies that they've supported that are socialist in nature.
[02:24:43.310 --> 02:24:46.052]  Everything from food stamps down to guns.
[02:24:46.593 --> 02:24:47.994]  We saw something pass last week.
[02:24:48.014 --> 02:24:51.436]  What passed last week with the guns in the White House?
[02:24:53.218 --> 02:24:57.761]  Or was there new legislation put forth after those shootings?
[02:24:58.752 --> 02:25:01.233]  I mean, this is stuff that you have to do in a common society.
[02:25:01.253 --> 02:25:05.314]  You have to, uh... Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:05.554 --> 02:25:06.795]  The red flag, exactly.
[02:25:06.815 --> 02:25:07.855]  The red flag stuff.
[02:25:08.375 --> 02:25:10.456]  You see, this is what you have to do in a common society.
[02:25:10.516 --> 02:25:11.737]  You gotta disarm the people.
[02:25:12.377 --> 02:25:16.498]  And the problem is, people are actually jumping into that argument.
[02:25:16.518 --> 02:25:18.399]  They're actually having that debate with the left.
[02:25:18.459 --> 02:25:20.580]  There is no debate for the Second Amendment.
[02:25:20.980 --> 02:25:24.041]  And a lot of people like to talk about additional amendments.
[02:25:24.597 --> 02:25:26.739]  To me, I'm stopping at the Bill of Rights.
[02:25:26.859 --> 02:25:29.380]  Everything after that is foo-foo, right?
[02:25:29.881 --> 02:25:30.601]  For the most part.
[02:25:31.222 --> 02:25:33.643]  I'm sticking with the first 10.
[02:25:33.784 --> 02:25:37.886]  And the first two are so important.
[02:25:38.947 --> 02:25:45.392]  But if you allow the Second Amendment to be up for debate, you're basically saying that their concerns are valid.
[02:25:45.852 --> 02:25:47.333]  Their concerns are not valid.
[02:25:47.853 --> 02:25:51.376]  When we look at the population of the United States, I don't know, what is it, 400 million, something like that?
[02:25:51.396 --> 02:25:52.757]  Somebody correct me.
[02:25:53.237 --> 02:25:53.397]  But
[02:25:54.898 --> 02:25:57.521]  We had 250-some-odd mass shootings this year.
[02:25:57.821 --> 02:26:01.144]  In my mind, I go, well, I'm surprised it's not 1,000.
[02:26:01.184 --> 02:26:02.666]  I'm surprised it's not 10,000.
[02:26:03.366 --> 02:26:05.348]  I look at it and go, good job, America.
[02:26:05.368 --> 02:26:07.110]  We're not mass shooting, killing each other.
[02:26:07.771 --> 02:26:10.994]  Because I would expect the number to be much higher than that.
[02:26:11.074 --> 02:26:15.838]  And they allow us to be fooled and say, oh, there's some epidemic
[02:26:17.921 --> 02:26:30.693]  That, you know, of homophobia or transphobia, you know, and they use those deaths and they inflate those numbers and use statistics and some odd weird shaped form to contort and match their views.
[02:26:31.274 --> 02:26:36.138]  But it's the fact that we allow these things to become a debate that makes them valid.
[02:26:36.238 --> 02:26:38.741]  Their claims are not valid, even statistically.
[02:26:39.341 --> 02:26:40.102]  They're not valid.
[02:26:40.817 --> 02:26:51.386]  Their claims when the girls had the World Cup, we found that per capita, the girls are paid more than the guys in the World Cup on the professional team.
[02:26:51.827 --> 02:26:54.049]  So there's nothing to have a debate about.
[02:26:54.089 --> 02:26:56.211]  The Second Amendment is not up for debate.
[02:26:56.891 --> 02:26:57.572]  Not up for debate.
[02:26:57.932 --> 02:26:58.533]  It is what it is.
[02:26:58.593 --> 02:27:02.836]  If you want to talk about why there's mass shootings, let's talk about mental health.
[02:27:03.297 --> 02:27:04.638]  And we're not socializing that.
[02:27:05.563 --> 02:27:09.827]  And we don't have, we really need to have a commission that investigates all these mass shooters.
[02:27:09.867 --> 02:27:12.309]  I mean, really delve deep into their lives.
[02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:14.131]  I mean, let's look at their family.
[02:27:14.171 --> 02:27:15.833]  Let's look at their diet.
[02:27:16.233 --> 02:27:17.975]  Let's look at what pharmaceutical pills they're on.
[02:27:18.015 --> 02:27:21.838]  I mean, let's really do a commission if we really want to find this out because you're not going to disarm Americans.
[02:27:22.619 --> 02:27:25.522]  That's just simply not going to happen and you don't want to see what would happen.
[02:27:25.802 --> 02:27:28.244]  And again, this whole red flag law thing.
[02:27:28.785 --> 02:27:30.526]  Look at how they would use it against people.
[02:27:31.147 --> 02:27:34.289]  Where they say, oh, if you're a conspiracy theorist, you're now a domestic terrorist.
[02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:35.629]  That's literally an FBI document.
[02:27:36.410 --> 02:27:40.752]  And so then they say, hey, Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in his prison cell.
[02:27:40.772 --> 02:27:41.632]  There's nothing to see here.
[02:27:41.972 --> 02:27:43.313]  And then you say, well, wait a second.
[02:27:43.333 --> 02:27:44.413]  There is something to see here.
[02:27:44.673 --> 02:27:45.814]  Why wasn't the camera working?
[02:27:45.874 --> 02:27:49.176]  Why wasn't the suicide watch on?
[02:27:49.216 --> 02:27:49.716]  Why wasn't this?
[02:27:49.776 --> 02:27:52.577]  Uh-oh, we got a conspiracy theorist.
[02:27:52.657 --> 02:27:54.558]  Sorry, we have to take your firearms.
[02:27:55.339 --> 02:27:56.279]  That's where this goes.
[02:27:57.219 --> 02:27:58.640]  Yeah, and that's another problem.
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:00.301]  We're allowing them to contort language.
[02:28:00.868 --> 02:28:04.118]  The term conspiracy, there is conspiracy means for people to conspire.
[02:28:04.158 --> 02:28:06.265]  And we know that people conspire all the time.
[02:28:06.726 --> 02:28:07.669]  The term theory.
[02:28:09.102 --> 02:28:11.464]  Means that you have to first have a hypothesis.
[02:28:11.504 --> 02:28:13.025]  You have to carry out experiments.
[02:28:13.085 --> 02:28:16.708]  Through those experiments, you have to find evidence to support your hypothesis.
[02:28:17.149 --> 02:28:19.470]  So we're not conspiracy hypothesizing.
[02:28:19.711 --> 02:28:21.692]  It's not a theory until it has evidence.
[02:28:22.093 --> 02:28:26.636]  And the problem is, people don't want to look at the evidence of these so-called conspiracy theories.
[02:28:26.997 --> 02:28:30.780]  But the problem is, we already allow people to contort our English language.
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:38.346]  If you read Orwell's political teachings and writings, speeches and writings, you'll see it in there when he says, they'll change what words mean.
[02:28:38.886 --> 02:28:41.088]  So we have to stop it right there.
[02:28:42.809 --> 02:28:43.549]  All right.
[02:28:44.570 --> 02:28:54.216]  Well, I didn't get to this story, but I figured that you'd be really happy to hear that Skipper and Ping, two male emperor penguins, are soon to be parents.
[02:28:54.256 --> 02:28:55.357]  They've adopted an egg.
[02:28:55.497 --> 02:28:58.079]  And I thought that I would just depart you with that great news.
[02:28:58.539 --> 02:29:01.221]  Gay penguins are finally parents, folks.
[02:29:01.241 --> 02:29:01.661]  We've done it.
[02:29:09.153 --> 02:29:10.914]  World War 4 is upon us.
[02:29:11.854 --> 02:29:12.795]  It's an economic war.
[02:29:13.475 --> 02:29:14.756]  It's a trade war.
[02:29:15.356 --> 02:29:16.437]  It's a proxy war.
[02:29:16.677 --> 02:29:17.637]  It's regional wars.
[02:29:17.857 --> 02:29:18.818]  It's a culture war.
[02:29:18.838 --> 02:29:21.859]  I'm going to just give you a brief gestalt lay history.
[02:29:21.959 --> 02:29:27.482]  Anybody can go research this for yourself about how Trump is launching via India a proxy war.
[02:29:27.582 --> 02:29:30.583]  So to understand what Trump's doing, we have to understand the history of it.
[02:29:30.603 --> 02:29:31.504]  1,400 years ago, Muhammad
[02:29:34.085 --> 02:29:34.726]  He's right here.
[02:29:34.926 --> 02:29:46.015]  He takes over the key crossroads of the caravans coming out of the empire of India that stretched all the way over to Iran and all the way into China.
[02:29:46.435 --> 02:29:49.758]  India was the dominant force, not China, not Japan at that time.
[02:29:49.778 --> 02:29:53.341]  They were the most powerful empire in the East and were expanding trade.
[02:29:53.381 --> 02:29:54.862]  So that's what's happening in India.
[02:29:54.942 --> 02:30:03.229]  Within just a few hundred years of Muhammad's death, they have already taken over what's Pakistan today, pushed the Indian empire back, taken over and surrounded India.
[02:30:04.622 --> 02:30:08.787]  You have Kashmir that is the birthplace of the Indian culture, instead of India.
[02:30:08.887 --> 02:30:11.630]  Folks flooded in from all over the world because there was so much prosperity in that area.
[02:30:11.730 --> 02:30:13.072]  So, all of that's going on.
[02:30:13.132 --> 02:30:14.033]  That's just some of the background.
[02:30:14.173 --> 02:30:15.695]  So, China is over here.
[02:30:15.975 --> 02:30:17.437]  They're starting to go into Hong Kong.
[02:30:17.457 --> 02:30:18.458]  They're starting to go into Taiwan.
[02:30:18.858 --> 02:30:20.120]  They're threatening Japan.
[02:30:20.220 --> 02:30:24.104]  They're building islands all over the place, way down here, even by the Philippines.
[02:30:24.124 --> 02:30:25.466]  The Philippines is having to threaten them now.
[02:30:25.606 --> 02:30:28.789]  They're sending in their companies that are really paramilitary and others.
[02:30:28.909 --> 02:30:30.110]  They're taking over the colleges.
[02:30:30.130 --> 02:30:31.711]  They're buying everybody off, just like they're doing here.
[02:30:31.731 --> 02:30:32.652]  They're buying off the media.
[02:30:32.692 --> 02:30:40.439]  They're using all this incredible money they've been given by us, giving trade superiority of $900 billion a year for decades, to be able to just take over the planet.
[02:30:40.739 --> 02:30:42.240]  And they were given $98 billion.
[02:30:43.181 --> 02:30:44.062]  percent of rare minerals.
[02:30:44.082 --> 02:30:45.442]  You just don't get that.
[02:30:45.762 --> 02:30:47.683]  No one else is allowed by the globalists to operate.
[02:30:47.723 --> 02:30:48.304]  They sue you.
[02:30:48.384 --> 02:30:49.344]  The UN comes after you.
[02:30:49.484 --> 02:30:52.306]  China is able to do human clones, take people's organs.
[02:30:52.346 --> 02:30:53.506]  They just do whatever the hell they want.
[02:30:53.526 --> 02:30:56.888]  They're God, basically, because they're an evil Qaikom force feeding on their own people.
[02:30:56.908 --> 02:30:59.389]  They're the model of the global technocracy the NWO wants.
[02:30:59.549 --> 02:31:02.951]  So Trump and Japan and South Korea and others form an alliance.
[02:31:03.151 --> 02:31:06.054]  As soon as Trump gets elected, he says this new order is a screwjob for everybody.
[02:31:06.314 --> 02:31:08.256]  We're not going along with it, including the Chinese people.
[02:31:08.497 --> 02:31:09.117]  They don't like it.
[02:31:09.197 --> 02:31:11.840]  He meets with the leader of India.
[02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:12.641]  He hugs him.
[02:31:12.781 --> 02:31:16.045]  He says, hey, if China gives you problems, it keeps trying to take over Kashmir.
[02:31:16.185 --> 02:31:22.932]  And at 49, the UN made India create an autonomous zone, which then now China has come in and openly taken over about a third of the country.
[02:31:23.072 --> 02:31:28.373]  The Islamists are pouring in, now pushing to the new borders of India and trying to take India proper over itself.
[02:31:28.593 --> 02:31:31.194]  And again, leftist media calls it Indian extremism.
[02:31:31.574 --> 02:31:33.175]  They call him a Hindu extremist.
[02:31:33.575 --> 02:31:36.875]  Even though the Pakistanis were Indians until the Islamists took it over.
[02:31:36.915 --> 02:31:38.896]  There's Hindu and Buddhist temples all over Pakistan.
[02:31:38.936 --> 02:31:39.496]  Well, there were.
[02:31:39.616 --> 02:31:40.656]  The Muslims blew them all up.
[02:31:40.776 --> 02:31:42.377]  So, all of this is happening.
[02:31:42.617 --> 02:31:43.697]  All of this is going on.
[02:31:43.757 --> 02:31:47.218]  And then once they take your country over, they remove any symbols you ever existed.
[02:31:47.258 --> 02:31:48.558]  They erase that they were Indians.
[02:31:48.958 --> 02:31:51.079]  So, you've got China bordering.
[02:31:51.679 --> 02:31:53.221]  Right here in what is Kashmir.
[02:31:53.521 --> 02:31:58.005]  And so, Trump green-lighted, go ahead, you're not under that UN thing anymore, go in.
[02:31:58.145 --> 02:32:03.329]  Within hours of what happened with the currency devaluation, within hours, they sent the troops in.
[02:32:03.429 --> 02:32:04.210]  The Indians did.
[02:32:04.310 --> 02:32:07.393]  And I want to be clear, India didn't invade Kashmir.
[02:32:07.493 --> 02:32:12.497]  Kashmir was stolen from it when the British Empire was dissolving and becoming the New World Order.
[02:32:12.517 --> 02:32:14.018]  Because India never really got its freedom.
[02:32:14.158 --> 02:32:18.322]  Under their current leader, India is, to a certain extent, actually becoming independent, finally.
[02:32:18.582 --> 02:32:25.304]  So, you got China right here, and this is the key piece in the whole chessboard, is this whole fight going on over India.
[02:32:25.504 --> 02:32:31.986]  Because you'll control the trade routes, you'll control the water, you'll control everything into Burma and Thailand and Vietnam and the Philippines.
[02:32:32.086 --> 02:32:33.567]  You've all had wars with China.
[02:32:33.707 --> 02:32:36.908]  China is completely expansionist, completely out of control.
[02:32:37.068 --> 02:32:40.449]  And so Trump has turned the Indians loose to be on their flank.
[02:32:40.669 --> 02:32:44.991]  And to let China know you're now in a vice grip, and this is the stuff that World War 4 is made of?
[02:32:45.271 --> 02:32:46.411]  This is the real deal.
[02:32:46.451 --> 02:32:49.913]  Doesn't mean nuclear missiles, doesn't mean huge explosions, even though both sides are nuclear powers.
[02:32:50.533 --> 02:32:51.233]  India and Pakistan.
[02:32:51.554 --> 02:32:57.556]  It means Trump's taken the gloves off, he's for real, this is really happening, and the House of World Government is dead!
[02:33:06.720 --> 02:33:09.341]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:24.712]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[02:33:25.152 --> 02:33:28.233]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:35.336 --> 02:33:42.078]  Alright, we are going to open up the phone lines for the remainder of the broadcast.
[02:33:42.098 --> 02:33:44.299]  The next hour and a half, I'll be here taking your phone calls.
[02:33:48.770 --> 02:33:50.552]  1-877-889-ALEX.
[02:33:50.572 --> 02:33:51.092]  1-877-889-ALEX.
[02:33:51.412 --> 02:33:56.436]  And, uh, I imagine everybody's gonna be wanting to talk about Epstein.
[02:33:56.456 --> 02:33:59.398]  And I wanna get your take.
[02:33:59.438 --> 02:34:00.879]  I mean, what do you think is going on here?
[02:34:00.899 --> 02:34:05.002]  I mean, yeah, let's... let's do what the mainstream media wants us to not do.
[02:34:05.103 --> 02:34:08.725]  And let's actually theorize what's going on, because we're not getting the truth.
[02:34:10.767 --> 02:34:10.887]  And...
[02:34:13.015 --> 02:34:16.576]  This is a story that we've been covering here at InfoWars for decades.
[02:34:16.796 --> 02:34:24.378]  You think we're just going to let this thing go, swept under the rug, without pulling that rug up and saying, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, what is this really?
[02:34:25.718 --> 02:34:30.160]  So let's take your calls on that, because more details continue to develop here.
[02:34:30.220 --> 02:34:33.561]  I got some other political news I want to pile drive through before I take your calls.
[02:34:34.661 --> 02:34:38.402]  But again, probably the last night,

[02:36:18.313 --> 02:36:18.653]  Alright.
[02:36:21.794 --> 02:36:26.995]  Before I take your calls on the Epstein stuff, let me checklist a couple things off here.
[02:36:27.115 --> 02:36:28.435]  First, this is big news.
[02:36:29.095 --> 02:36:39.938]  Because this is common sense, and this should have happened a long time ago, and that is a new
[02:36:41.769 --> 02:37:06.437]  Trump policy for immigration where by the way Trump had to deal with the old president of Guatemala now there's a new president that deal looks like it may not work out they were flying people back to Guatemala I think that may stop that was big and they were stopping people at Guatemala that may change now so that's going to be an interesting development as far as that's concerned but Trump policy is from the New York Times yesterday or
[02:37:07.571 --> 02:37:08.051]  Two days ago.
[02:37:08.091 --> 02:37:10.812]  Trump policy favors wealthier immigrants for green cards.
[02:37:11.313 --> 02:37:18.116]  And then yesterday you had the Trump administration giving a press conference on what this actually means.
[02:37:19.156 --> 02:37:21.097]  Guys, this is clip one in my video list.
[02:37:21.117 --> 02:37:24.759]  Trump administration now planning to deny green cards to immigrants on public assistance.
[02:37:35.084 --> 02:37:35.324]  Alright.
[02:37:38.877 --> 02:37:39.137]  Okay.
[02:37:40.758 --> 02:37:42.339]  Let's just not do videos then.
[02:37:42.679 --> 02:37:44.980]  I'll just do a news blitz here.
[02:37:45.140 --> 02:37:45.720]  We'll just do that.
[02:37:46.601 --> 02:37:46.961]  Okay.
[02:37:49.842 --> 02:37:51.003]  Let me just shuffle through some things here.
[02:37:51.403 --> 02:37:51.723]  Alright.
[02:37:52.944 --> 02:38:00.367]  Let's take a look, then, at what's going on on the Democrats' side of this presidential race.
[02:38:00.407 --> 02:38:05.590]  Now, it's honestly embarrassing at this point that the Democrats are even trying to put up a fight.
[02:38:07.354 --> 02:38:14.359]  It really is an embarrassing joke and I see headlines like this and I just laugh.
[02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:22.225]  Elizabeth Warren wows crowd in Iowa as the caucus begins.
[02:38:22.325 --> 02:38:25.667]  Elizabeth Warren wows the crowd in Iowa.
[02:38:28.769 --> 02:38:32.192]  Elizabeth Warren hasn't wowed anything ever.
[02:38:33.561 --> 02:38:36.882]  Although I do think she did another video on Instagram a couple nights ago drinking a beer.
[02:38:37.902 --> 02:38:39.583]  So some people may have said wow at that.
[02:38:40.463 --> 02:38:40.923]  But yes.
[02:38:41.603 --> 02:38:42.164]  Wows.
[02:38:42.384 --> 02:38:43.644]  Elizabeth Warren wows.
[02:38:44.564 --> 02:38:45.585]  Wows the audience.
[02:38:47.425 --> 02:38:47.545]  Okay.
[02:38:47.565 --> 02:38:50.046]  How about Beto O'Rourke?
[02:38:50.606 --> 02:38:50.946]  Rah!
[02:38:50.986 --> 02:38:53.587]  He wows the audience pulling at zero percent.
[02:38:54.327 --> 02:38:56.148]  Now he does a video trying to change a tire.
[02:38:56.908 --> 02:38:57.508]  Couldn't even do it.
[02:38:59.569 --> 02:39:02.270]  Beto O'Rourke attempts to change a tire
[02:39:03.243 --> 02:39:04.944]  Live on video.
[02:39:06.224 --> 02:39:10.305]  Oh yes, this will certainly get you from 0% to 1% Beto.
[02:39:12.186 --> 02:39:13.026]  This is the one.
[02:39:14.446 --> 02:39:18.007]  This is the video that will get Beto elected.
[02:39:18.687 --> 02:39:26.970]  If he's not going live from the dentist chair, if he's not going live with his dog looking like an abuse victim, if he's not
[02:39:28.158 --> 02:39:29.800]  Skateboarding across the stage.
[02:39:30.500 --> 02:39:32.562]  He's changing attire.
[02:39:32.662 --> 02:39:33.943]  It's Beto!
[02:39:34.383 --> 02:39:38.287]  Oh, if he's not... What is that?
[02:39:39.628 --> 02:39:40.349]  Wait a second!
[02:39:40.929 --> 02:39:43.691]  Did Beto O'Rourke get a haircut live on video too?
[02:39:44.352 --> 02:39:44.953]  Is that real?
[02:39:46.033 --> 02:39:48.335]  Oh my gosh, what a dork, man.
[02:39:48.536 --> 02:39:50.798]  This guy's like Butters from South Park.
[02:39:52.059 --> 02:39:53.480]  When they go up to Butters and they're like,
[02:39:54.488 --> 02:39:57.549]  They're like, oh, are there any other people in there?
[02:39:57.569 --> 02:39:59.469]  And he goes, yeah, there's construction butters.
[02:40:00.089 --> 02:40:02.190]  There's truck driver butters.
[02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.850]  That's Beto.
[02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:05.230]  It's like, yeah, there's tire change Beto.
[02:40:05.630 --> 02:40:07.011]  There's Mexican Beto.
[02:40:07.611 --> 02:40:09.311]  There's skateboarding Beto.
[02:40:09.611 --> 02:40:11.092]  There's guitar playing Beto.
[02:40:11.192 --> 02:40:13.152]  It's like, that's literally butters.
[02:40:13.652 --> 02:40:15.853]  And they think he has split personality disorder.
[02:40:15.973 --> 02:40:19.893]  No, he's just like, Beto pretends to be all of these people.
[02:40:19.933 --> 02:40:20.574]  It's the funniest thing.
[02:40:20.614 --> 02:40:21.574]  He thinks he's going to get him elected.
[02:40:22.214 --> 02:40:22.294]  Oh!
[02:40:24.471 --> 02:40:25.872]  Let's not forget about the real threat.
[02:40:29.075 --> 02:40:31.517]  Marianne Williamson with her mind powers.
[02:40:33.980 --> 02:40:39.284]  Marianne Williamson says powerful forces on the left out to end presidential campaign.
[02:40:39.745 --> 02:40:40.826]  Well, she's actually right.
[02:40:41.426 --> 02:40:49.854]  And if she was smart, and if Tulsi Gabbard was smart, Tulsi Gabbard would team up with Marianne Williamson right now.
[02:40:51.365 --> 02:40:54.426]  If Marianne Williamson actually believes this, because Tulsi knows this is going on.
[02:40:54.686 --> 02:40:55.727]  She's suing Google.
[02:40:57.288 --> 02:40:59.468]  She knows the Democrat Party doesn't want her to get the nomination.
[02:40:59.709 --> 02:41:02.590]  She just has enough confidence that she thinks she can beat a rigged system.
[02:41:03.390 --> 02:41:07.392]  Marianne Williamson might not feel the same way, but she is right!
[02:41:08.572 --> 02:41:16.976]  The Democrat Party has been rigging their selection for president for a long, long time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:20.868 --> 02:41:23.170]  Now, do we have clips ready to go?
[02:41:24.331 --> 02:41:26.033]  Can I get the two Kamala Harris clips?
[02:41:26.353 --> 02:41:26.933]  Is that possible?
[02:41:32.798 --> 02:41:33.379]  Alright, never mind.
[02:41:33.399 --> 02:41:35.861]  I said we wouldn't do videos, so just forget it.
[02:41:36.482 --> 02:41:38.483]  Tell me if this is not discrimination.
[02:41:39.665 --> 02:41:43.088]  California City denies straight pride rally permit.
[02:41:44.128 --> 02:41:44.329]  Hmm.
[02:41:45.009 --> 02:41:45.850]  Now, imagine
[02:41:47.532 --> 02:41:52.836]  If you wanted to have a gay pride parade in California and rejected your permit, can you imagine the headlines?
[02:41:54.297 --> 02:42:00.942]  Can you imagine what the press would be saying if you denied a gay pride parade?
[02:42:01.602 --> 02:42:07.246]  But, if it's a straight pride parade, shut it down.
[02:42:08.147 --> 02:42:10.449]  You see, we only want to have a parade.
[02:42:11.215 --> 02:42:22.344]  If it's going to be sexualizing the kids and a bunch of guys, you know, going around flashing their genitals everywhere, a bunch of women flopping around with their tops off, you know, that's the kind of pride parade we want.
[02:42:22.384 --> 02:42:25.926]  But you want to have a straight pride parade that will probably be modest?
[02:42:26.867 --> 02:42:28.768]  You know, just just stay at home.
[02:42:29.029 --> 02:42:30.049]  We're not interested in that.
[02:42:30.750 --> 02:42:33.592]  You know, that's that's not the kind of thing we're interested in.
[02:42:35.894 --> 02:42:37.195]  And this is from Campus Reform.
[02:42:38.396 --> 02:42:38.856]  Video.
[02:42:39.056 --> 02:42:43.258]  Student signed petition to ban offensive white man in crosswalk signs.
[02:42:43.418 --> 02:42:44.078]  Oh my gosh!
[02:42:44.778 --> 02:42:45.378]  I forgot.
[02:42:45.858 --> 02:42:50.320]  The man in the crosswalk sign is white and therefore racist.
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:51.820]  We should make the man black.
[02:42:52.321 --> 02:42:54.261]  Therefore you can't even see the crosswalk sign.
[02:42:54.581 --> 02:42:57.302]  That way you walk into the middle of the street and die.
[02:42:57.662 --> 02:43:01.323]  You see, that's one way to cure racism is to walk in the middle of the street, get ran over by a car and die.
[02:43:03.220 --> 02:43:14.607]  We just passed the August 6th one-year anniversary of the historic event where all of Big Tech, working in concert, banned InfoWars and Alex Jones off the internet.
[02:43:14.687 --> 02:43:18.670]  Well, Alex Jones has been banned from all tech platforms.
[02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:19.710]  Nobody said anything.
[02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:22.012]  So Big Tech's language police are getting bolder.
[02:43:22.052 --> 02:43:28.316]  Now four media giants are banding together to take down controversial InfoWars content from their site.
[02:43:28.476 --> 02:43:35.420]  YouTube, Facebook, and Apple all announcing they're removing his content from their platforms.
[02:43:35.601 --> 02:43:49.089]  But by the grace of God and via Matt Drudge's warning and others' warnings, we have helped build our own infrastructure, our own video, our own audio, our own news gathering system at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:43:49.449 --> 02:43:51.831]  And it's all because of your support.
[02:43:52.191 --> 02:43:53.232]  This is the house you built.
[02:43:53.792 --> 02:43:59.435]  I want to play a few minutes of just a sampling of the demonization and the lies of a year ago.
[02:43:59.876 --> 02:44:07.460]  And then I want to play a few minutes of what's happening currently as thousands and thousands of prominent people are completely banned and unpersoned as well.
[02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:10.202]  And as hundreds of millions of accounts
[02:44:11.002 --> 02:44:17.923]  Of people following popular meme sites and other sites on Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube are being deleted.
[02:44:18.423 --> 02:44:24.144]  That's hundreds of millions of followers not being able to choose what content they see.
[02:44:24.925 --> 02:44:25.725]  This is outrageous.
[02:44:26.345 --> 02:44:27.425]  That's incredibly dangerous.
[02:44:28.345 --> 02:44:29.865]  But it's the day and age that we live in.
[02:44:30.626 --> 02:44:35.046]  Thank God we built InfoWars so there'd be some voice in the midst of this.
[02:44:35.666 --> 02:44:37.967]  And that's why it's so important to remember before we play these clips that
[02:44:39.161 --> 02:44:43.166]  Without your word of mouth, and without you spreading the word, no one knows we're still here and still on air.
[02:44:43.506 --> 02:44:46.069]  Thanks to you doing that, we're coming back from the dead.
[02:44:47.043 --> 02:44:49.585]  And without your financial support, we won't be here either.
[02:44:50.045 --> 02:44:51.727]  So please check out the huge sales we have running.
[02:44:52.027 --> 02:45:01.073]  The Banniversary Sale, 50-60% off all the supplements, 50% off water filtration, air filtration, storable food, store-wide free shipping, and double Patriot Points, and a lot more.
[02:45:01.534 --> 02:45:03.855]  So be sure and visit InfoWareStore.com.
[02:45:04.216 --> 02:45:08.439]  Now let's go to the folks who tell us that we need to be banned, we need to be silenced, that we need to be shut down.
[02:45:09.059 --> 02:45:12.382]  And that, well, chief among those is yours truly, Alex Jones.
[02:45:12.842 --> 02:45:15.704]  Yesterday, Alex Jones became an un-person.
[02:45:15.884 --> 02:45:21.607]  Apple last night removed the entire library of Alex Jones' podcasts from their store.
[02:45:21.687 --> 02:45:28.111]  The conspiracy theories are beyond the realm, are not only beyond being offensive, they're dangerous.
[02:45:28.191 --> 02:45:37.597]  And we don't do enough in telling people out there right now this morning, people who read newspapers, exactly who these people are and what they believe.
[02:45:37.897 --> 02:45:38.917]  I want them shut down.
[02:45:38.977 --> 02:45:39.898]  I want them silenced.
[02:45:39.938 --> 02:45:40.738]  I want them muted.
[02:45:40.758 --> 02:45:42.598]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:45:42.658 --> 02:45:51.921]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[02:45:52.241 --> 02:46:01.124]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating with each other, just like communist China.
[02:46:01.224 --> 02:46:02.644]  And we're also standing up
[02:46:03.689 --> 02:46:06.390]  To social media censorship.
[02:46:06.430 --> 02:46:07.310]  That's the new thing.
[02:46:07.550 --> 02:46:13.772]  People at home could go and search, say, Alex Jones, a prominent InfoWars.com media broadcaster.
[02:46:13.972 --> 02:46:19.393]  If you go to DuckDuckGo or you go to Bing and you search Alex Jones, you'll find InfoWars in a mix of articles.
[02:46:19.793 --> 02:46:23.594]  If you go to Google, you won't even find his main broadcasting station, InfoWars.
[02:46:23.694 --> 02:46:25.835]  Instead, you'll just find a bunch of negative hit pieces.
[02:46:26.075 --> 02:46:31.578]  Conservatives are feeling the heavy hand of censorship in the United States and across Western Europe.
[02:46:31.678 --> 02:46:38.062]  Their social media accounts are being banned, blocked, and cancelled on Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook.
[02:46:38.182 --> 02:46:44.646]  And in 2020, you can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out.
[02:46:45.226 --> 02:46:48.989]  And the methods that they're using are invisible.
[02:46:49.069 --> 02:46:50.309]  They're subliminal.
[02:46:50.610 --> 02:46:52.591]  They're more powerful than...
[02:46:53.531 --> 02:47:21.722]  Most any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences and I've been in the behavioral sciences for almost 40 years InfoWars tomorrow's news today You're listening to the Alex Jones Show The West
[02:47:22.806 --> 02:47:31.950]  Alright, we're going to take your phone calls.
[02:47:32.650 --> 02:47:39.933]  Big developments happening in Hong Kong as protesters choke airport and Chinese forces pass at border.
[02:47:40.033 --> 02:47:43.575]  I've been told that riot police have gone into the airport.
[02:47:43.615 --> 02:47:44.435]  This is just what we're seeing.
[02:47:44.455 --> 02:47:45.296]  Imagine what we're not seeing.
[02:47:46.809 --> 02:47:52.673]  Not only are American flags making an appearance in the Hong Kong protests, Pepe the Frog!
[02:47:54.134 --> 02:48:02.058]  Pepe the Frog is now going viral in Hong Kong as a symbol of resistance.
[02:48:02.679 --> 02:48:05.861]  So this is just wacky, wild stuff happening.
[02:48:06.861 --> 02:48:15.767]  And it was almost like the president was trolling China today, or the Hong Kong protests, saying, I forget the tweet, but he basically was like, why are they blaming us for this?
[02:48:17.711 --> 02:48:20.312]  Maybe because we love freedom and we hate communism?
[02:48:20.492 --> 02:48:20.852]  I don't know.
[02:48:22.152 --> 02:48:24.893]  But we're taking your calls right now because here's the other thing too.
[02:48:27.213 --> 02:48:29.234]  We cannot let this Epstein thing die.
[02:48:29.734 --> 02:48:36.796]  We cannot let them cover up industrial level pedophile networks that implicate some of the most powerful names in the world.
[02:48:37.436 --> 02:48:42.377]  We cannot just let them sweep this under the rug via murder or whatever the hell went on.
[02:48:43.877 --> 02:48:45.819]  So, I wanna just talk to the audience.
[02:48:45.839 --> 02:48:49.482]  I mean, let's really get, let's, you've heard what we think here, you've heard some of our theories.
[02:48:49.542 --> 02:48:51.624]  I mean, yeah, oh, you're not allowed to be a conspiracy theorist.
[02:48:51.704 --> 02:48:54.106]  Yeah, go, yeah, okay.
[02:48:55.727 --> 02:48:59.951]  We know what you can do if you're gonna tell us to not think critically.
[02:49:00.651 --> 02:49:03.274]  So, let's go to this critically thinking audience right now.
[02:49:03.354 --> 02:49:09.699]  Let's go to, let's see, let's start with Chase the Patriot in California.
[02:49:09.759 --> 02:49:10.420]  Go ahead, Chase.
[02:49:11.465 --> 02:49:13.126]  Hey Owen, thanks for taking my call.
[02:49:13.246 --> 02:49:20.232]  Real quick, I do want to say that I'm with those fellow patriots in Hong Kong, standing up against that communist Chinese government.
[02:49:20.612 --> 02:49:23.214]  It's very strong to see those American flags waving.
[02:49:23.655 --> 02:49:25.436]  But hey, I'm calling on this Epstein thing.
[02:49:25.816 --> 02:49:30.900]  And you know, there's all these different theories out there, and a lot of times it sounds like it's too crazy to be true.
[02:49:31.301 --> 02:49:32.882]  So one of them is the body double.
[02:49:33.162 --> 02:49:34.403]  They switched Epstein.
[02:49:34.423 --> 02:49:35.424]  There was a body double.
[02:49:35.764 --> 02:49:39.007]  And yeah, that sounds crazy, but let's go back in history a little bit.
[02:49:39.508 --> 02:49:42.569]  Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated JFK.
[02:49:43.009 --> 02:49:48.410]  Very similar to Epstein, somebody took him out and killed him, shot in the gut, right in front of the world to see.
[02:49:48.890 --> 02:49:52.611]  Well, do you guys understand that people thought there was a body double after that?
[02:49:53.011 --> 02:49:59.353]  And they actually exhumed Lee Harvey Oswald's body in 1981 to prove that it actually was him.
[02:49:59.673 --> 02:50:02.813]  So this isn't the first time people have questioned and talked about a body double.
[02:50:03.233 --> 02:50:05.494]  Actually, I was talking about this last night on my show.
[02:50:06.044 --> 02:50:13.787]  And the number of people that have been taken out, both good, bad, and ugly people, from Michael Hastings to Will Cooper, I mean, the list goes on and on.
[02:50:14.127 --> 02:50:19.209]  People need to understand that they will take people out to keep the deep state in line.
[02:50:19.689 --> 02:50:21.230]  Well, that's really what this comes down to.
[02:50:21.270 --> 02:50:22.890]  It's just like, look, I don't know what happened.
[02:50:22.910 --> 02:50:24.331]  I mean, was there a body double?
[02:50:24.371 --> 02:50:25.011]  Was there not?
[02:50:25.071 --> 02:50:25.972]  Was it suicide?
[02:50:26.012 --> 02:50:26.652]  Was he murdered?
[02:50:26.672 --> 02:50:27.252]  Was he choked?
[02:50:27.292 --> 02:50:31.594]  I mean, but that's the whole thing is, they're saying, oh, you can't question this.
[02:50:32.794 --> 02:50:34.255]  We're in control of the narrative.
[02:50:35.256 --> 02:50:38.278]  And if you question this, you know, you're a bad guy, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:50:38.358 --> 02:50:38.658]  No!
[02:50:40.139 --> 02:50:41.320]  This is not cut-and-dry.
[02:50:41.340 --> 02:50:42.401]  Of course we're going to question this.
[02:50:42.421 --> 02:50:53.989]  This is a huge cover-up we're witnessing right now, and they just want to sweep it under the rug and use all the international globalist media to just say, oh, financier was suicided.
[02:50:54.610 --> 02:51:02.876]  Now, okay, the big thing that people are making here is that the nose in the picture that we've received, and I guess the ears too,
[02:51:04.013 --> 02:51:06.614]  Basically saying it's a different guy, that's the body double.
[02:51:07.514 --> 02:51:15.816]  If that's the case, then you think they took him into witness protection and this whole thing is just a front to cover for that.
[02:51:16.316 --> 02:51:17.176]  Thanks for the call, Chase.
[02:51:17.236 --> 02:51:19.476]  Let's go to Brady in Virginia.
[02:51:19.516 --> 02:51:20.116]  Go ahead, Brady.
[02:51:21.497 --> 02:51:22.317]  Hey, what's up, Owen?
[02:51:22.377 --> 02:51:23.577]  Thanks for taking my call, man.
[02:51:24.677 --> 02:51:30.839]  I just wanted to say, as far as your broadcast yesterday with Epstein, I think you completely hit it home.
[02:51:33.025 --> 02:51:45.612]  I'm really glad that you guys are staying on top of that because it's so important that we keep talking about it because it seems like time and time again that when things like this come up, they just get swept under the rug and they never get talked about again.
[02:51:46.152 --> 02:51:50.735]  There's things that are as high level as this that they need to be taken care of.
[02:51:52.496 --> 02:51:55.878]  So I'm really glad that you guys were on top of that yesterday.
[02:51:55.898 --> 02:52:02.101]  As far as the Trump green card policy goes, I look at that and I think
[02:52:03.058 --> 02:52:04.499]  You know, that's just common sense.
[02:52:04.559 --> 02:52:10.885]  I mean, we've got so many hardworking Americans out there looking for jobs, just like with the story that came out today.
[02:52:11.365 --> 02:52:17.691]  You've got people that are now applying for jobs at stores where these illegals were working after these raids.
[02:52:18.251 --> 02:52:21.094]  And so I look at that and I'm thinking, well, that's just common sense.
[02:52:21.114 --> 02:52:26.779]  So if somebody is on, you know, government benefits, of course they should be more likely to be deported.
[02:52:26.879 --> 02:52:28.020]  That's just common sense.
[02:52:30.503 --> 02:52:33.025]  Well, and that's all we're looking for is common sense policies.
[02:52:33.645 --> 02:52:41.812]  Like, for example, why aren't we deporting the 30% of the prison system that is made up of non-citizens, illegal immigrants?
[02:52:42.532 --> 02:52:50.959]  And you have the left saying, well look, or the Democrats or just any bleeding heart liberal or whatever will say, we're a nation built on immigrants.
[02:52:51.700 --> 02:52:53.581]  Immigrants have always come here and built America.
[02:52:53.661 --> 02:52:54.682]  Okay, sure.
[02:52:55.403 --> 02:52:56.704]  They didn't get on welfare!
[02:52:57.628 --> 02:52:58.288]  That's the whole thing.
[02:52:58.388 --> 02:53:04.150]  For example, you know, there was this Budweiser commercial, Anheuser-Busch commercial, it was like two years ago during the Super Bowl.
[02:53:04.790 --> 02:53:07.930]  And I kind of thought unfairly, maybe I'm just biased because I'm from St.
[02:53:07.950 --> 02:53:23.074]  Louis, I'm directly tied to this, but I thought it was some unfair criticism where they did this commercial about how the original Augustus Bush came over and teamed up with Anheuser to make a beer product.
[02:53:23.396 --> 02:53:27.258]  You know, came over on the ship to America to make his beer.
[02:53:27.738 --> 02:53:29.439]  Well, to me, that's the whole point.
[02:53:30.099 --> 02:53:32.961]  I didn't take it like, oh, you know, we should just let anybody come here.
[02:53:33.061 --> 02:53:35.742]  I took it like, no, you come here with a dream.
[02:53:36.482 --> 02:53:37.843]  You come here with an idea.
[02:53:37.903 --> 02:53:39.003]  You come here with a purpose.
[02:53:39.023 --> 02:53:41.044]  You come here with the will to execute.
[02:53:41.064 --> 02:53:42.705]  That's the American dream.
[02:53:42.765 --> 02:53:43.766]  That's the American way.
[02:53:44.206 --> 02:53:45.927]  You come here and ask for a handout.
[02:53:45.987 --> 02:53:47.567]  You come here and suck off the system.
[02:53:47.808 --> 02:53:48.968]  No, that's the communist way.
[02:53:49.048 --> 02:53:50.269]  We don't do that here.
[02:53:50.829 --> 02:53:51.930]  And so that's all this is to me.
[02:53:51.950 --> 02:53:52.410]  It's saying, look,
[02:53:53.402 --> 02:53:59.367]  Sure, we want immigrants to build things, create things, innovate, invent, add to society.
[02:54:01.289 --> 02:54:07.534]  We don't want people to come here and have no prospects, no future, and just end up sucking off the system.
[02:54:07.634 --> 02:54:09.916]  And to me, that just is common sense, as you said.
[02:54:09.956 --> 02:54:10.797]  Thanks for the call, Brady.
[02:54:10.817 --> 02:54:12.939]  Let's go to Michael in Washington, D.C.
[02:54:12.979 --> 02:54:13.619]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:54:14.440 --> 02:54:15.461]  Hey, Rowan.
[02:54:15.521 --> 02:54:16.542]  First-time caller.
[02:54:16.642 --> 02:54:18.604]  I've been a long-time fan of the show.
[02:54:19.905 --> 02:54:21.126]  I also, by the way, wanted
[02:54:21.693 --> 02:54:22.494]  Uh, do a plug.
[02:54:22.554 --> 02:54:25.795]  I did, uh, support the money bomb that you guys did recently.
[02:54:25.815 --> 02:54:28.877]  I got my Super Metal Vitality from B-12.
[02:54:29.377 --> 02:54:31.618]  I got a shirt from my dad for his, uh, birthday.
[02:54:31.638 --> 02:54:32.259]  He loves it.
[02:54:32.879 --> 02:54:39.303]  And, um, about this whole Epstein thing, uh, you know, I saw, I think it was on, uh, Fox.
[02:54:40.143 --> 02:54:45.946]  Ken, Ken Starr was in the news talking about it and, like, how they're, he was kind of tied to Epstein.
[02:54:46.587 --> 02:54:51.069]  And the one thing that kind of jumped out at me is that I think he's actually a member of the Bohemian Grove.
[02:54:52.279 --> 02:54:57.041]  Um, it was like really an esoteric, you know, thing I had seen.
[02:54:57.762 --> 02:55:13.549]  And then just to touch on that, uh, come on immigration, you know, I think it's a double-edged sword because you have these people that are saying, oh, you know, we need to preserve American values, but at the same time, they will find every exception for people that really don't deserve it.
[02:55:13.589 --> 02:55:14.149]  For example,
[02:55:14.980 --> 02:55:21.522]  You know, like, Texas v. Johnson, where, like, they allowed a communist to burn a flag that wasn't his private property.
[02:55:21.542 --> 02:55:24.143]  He stole it from a public building.
[02:55:24.984 --> 02:55:28.065]  And that's now being described as, you know, freedom of speech.
[02:55:28.125 --> 02:55:29.565]  So what's the next freedom of speech?
[02:55:29.626 --> 02:55:33.967]  Is it, like, that we're supposed to defend criminals that come over the border and attack us?
[02:55:34.627 --> 02:55:38.569]  Are they supposed to be, you know, their right to expressive conduct by crossing the border?
[02:55:38.689 --> 02:55:39.669]  Is that freedom of speech?
[02:55:40.310 --> 02:55:41.350]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:55:42.346 --> 02:55:45.227]  Well, yeah, I mean, they go take down the American flag at ICE facilities.
[02:55:45.327 --> 02:55:46.408]  In fact, there's just a story.
[02:55:47.048 --> 02:55:50.630]  Someone went and just shot up, I think last night, the San Antonio ICE facility.
[02:55:50.650 --> 02:55:53.131]  In fact, I sent that out.
[02:55:53.211 --> 02:55:54.112]  See if you can print that.
[02:55:54.832 --> 02:56:00.335]  So, they're continuing to do this in the... Oh, I can't even get into this.
[02:56:00.955 --> 02:56:05.457]  Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, she is just... She's falling off the rocker.
[02:56:07.378 --> 02:56:07.718]  I don't know.
[02:56:08.279 --> 02:56:09.179]  It's just insane.
[02:56:09.199 --> 02:56:10.780]  But, yeah, I guess that's what they'll do next.
[02:56:12.449 --> 02:56:17.694]  If you even criticize an illegal immigrant, you know, well that's what they do now in Canada and the UK.
[02:56:17.714 --> 02:56:19.435]  If you say the wrong pronoun, you go to jail.
[02:56:19.715 --> 02:56:20.596]  Thanks for the call, Michael.
[02:56:20.916 --> 02:56:22.538]  Let's squeeze in Benny in California.
[02:56:22.578 --> 02:56:23.138]  Go ahead, Benny.
[02:56:23.158 --> 02:56:25.481]  What's going on, Owen?
[02:56:25.681 --> 02:56:27.202]  I just want to say three things.
[02:56:27.362 --> 02:56:30.865]  First of all, I want to talk about Chris Rado.
[02:56:31.286 --> 02:56:32.527]  Get off the roids.
[02:56:33.177 --> 02:56:36.659]  And go to InfoWarsTore.com and get you some Happys.
[02:56:37.119 --> 02:56:39.020]  That stuff will mellow you out, my brother.
[02:56:39.441 --> 02:56:46.085]  And then take some brain force with a little turbo force and hit the gym naturally in a safe way.
[02:56:46.805 --> 02:56:48.726]  No, that's it.
[02:56:49.106 --> 02:56:53.529]  We need to send Chris Cuomo a five-pack of Happys from InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:56:53.609 --> 02:56:55.410]  It's the Chris Cuomo special.
[02:56:56.111 --> 02:56:57.732]  Yeah, let me do it.
[02:56:57.772 --> 02:56:59.993]  Nobody's buying the Jeffrey Epstein
[02:57:00.723 --> 02:57:03.345]  Every morning before I come to work, I stop at my local coffee shop.
[02:57:04.145 --> 02:57:05.746]  Me and my buddy, we talk politics.
[02:57:06.566 --> 02:57:07.547]  So we're just like, you know what?
[02:57:07.567 --> 02:57:12.650]  Historic people, regular people that come in here, what they think about Durham, just not into politics.
[02:57:13.140 --> 02:57:17.625]  Well, we're just trying to get their input, and we're just asking random people, hey, what do you think about this?
[02:57:17.645 --> 02:57:18.265]  What do you think about this?
[02:57:18.625 --> 02:57:19.727]  Nobody is buying.
[02:57:19.747 --> 02:57:22.289]  Everybody was saying they're trying to cover up something.
[02:57:22.649 --> 02:57:23.771]  It's deeper than this.
[02:57:23.871 --> 02:57:25.272]  Politicians are involved.
[02:57:25.352 --> 02:57:27.474]  Nobody's buying the S-thing thing.
[02:57:27.795 --> 02:57:31.358]  And third of all, I'll see all my Patriots August 17th in Portland.
[02:57:31.378 --> 02:57:34.561]  Shout-out to Joe Biggs, Enrique Tarrio, Jason Lowe, and all my provosts.
[02:57:35.856 --> 02:57:37.058]  Alright Benny, thanks for the call.
[02:57:37.698 --> 02:57:43.585]  Yeah, and the Democrats kind of put themselves in a trap here trying to blame Trump and connect Trump to Epstein.
[02:57:44.106 --> 02:57:49.933]  So now just the average Democrat, you know, leftist who wants to be involved is saying, oh Trump is covering up Epstein.
[02:57:55.399 --> 02:57:56.601]  William in Florida.
[02:57:57.141 --> 02:57:58.082]  William, you're on the air.
[02:57:58.122 --> 02:57:58.503]  Go ahead.
[02:57:58.563 --> 02:57:59.324]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:57:59.384 --> 02:58:00.285]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:58:00.345 --> 02:58:01.026]  Thanks for calling.
[02:58:01.066 --> 02:58:03.749]  Before I get into my points, I want to plug a couple products.
[02:58:03.809 --> 02:58:05.131]  First off, the Immune Wall.
[02:58:05.171 --> 02:58:06.272]  You don't mention it very much.
[02:58:06.292 --> 02:58:07.533]  It helps keep me healthy.
[02:58:07.754 --> 02:58:12.739]  I work in an environment where I'm exposed to the public, and of course, you know, everything that comes along with that.
[02:58:12.780 --> 02:58:13.180]  Stay healthy.
[02:58:16.002 --> 02:58:16.802]  Well thank you.
[02:58:16.882 --> 02:58:24.727]  For those that don't know, you've got things like emergency and you've got things like airport or whatever it's called that you know that people take and those things have some good things in them.
[02:58:24.827 --> 02:58:30.230]  When we did immune wall, I'm like what's three times stronger than any other immune support formula?
[02:58:30.250 --> 02:58:39.596]  They're like okay we can make this and so anything we make is just chocked full of the very best things and yes the super silver wound gel is a natural
[02:58:39.636 --> 02:58:46.122]  National brand, patented, FDA approved, used at hospitals, used over the counter, $40 a tube.
[02:58:46.283 --> 02:58:48.725]  We have to pay like $13 or something a tube.
[02:58:48.745 --> 02:58:50.687]  For folks who don't know, it's like gloves.
[02:58:50.827 --> 02:58:57.514]  Put a tiny bit on your hands, rub it, and then it's a preemptive wall of the strongest silver allowed by the FDA over the counter.
[02:58:57.694 --> 02:58:58.394]  Let me be very clear.
[02:58:58.674 --> 02:59:00.295]  Do not ingest it, okay?
[02:59:00.355 --> 02:59:01.716]  It's very toxic.
[02:59:01.736 --> 02:59:03.097]  But, I mean, it's weaponized.
[02:59:03.197 --> 02:59:04.697]  It's the strongest silver over-the-counter.
[02:59:04.797 --> 02:59:09.220]  But bacteria, viruses, it's approved and proven to kill them better than a hammer.
[02:59:09.520 --> 02:59:13.942]  Since you mentioned it, my friend, what experience have you had with a super silver wound gel?
[02:59:14.322 --> 02:59:22.810]  Everything from minor burns to actually take out a little sloppy in the kitchen one day, and I normally turn my, when I'm chopping stuff, I turn the knife away from me.
[02:59:22.830 --> 02:59:23.490]  I didn't do that.
[02:59:23.530 --> 02:59:24.131]  I was in a hurry.
[02:59:24.151 --> 02:59:27.594]  Couldn't reach for the knife, and I cut my finger right down to the bone.
[02:59:27.854 --> 02:59:34.820]  It was bleeding pretty good, and I put the super-silver wound gel on that and wrapped it, of course, and in less than four hours, the pain was gone.
[02:59:34.840 --> 02:59:37.983]  In a day, the deepest part of the cut was already healing up.
[02:59:38.223 --> 02:59:47.767]  It is the best wound gel out there, and I've tried to haggle them down on the price, but after the patents and the FDA approval took them like nine years, this is the thing used in hospitals.
[02:59:47.807 --> 02:59:49.187]  So we're very, very proud of it.
[02:59:49.267 --> 02:59:50.388]  So thanks for the plug, William.
[02:59:56.330 --> 03:00:00.291]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:09.255 --> 03:00:13.159]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:00:13.599 --> 03:00:17.523]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:18.264 --> 03:00:21.287]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:00:22.488 --> 03:00:25.231]  Alright, the Chinese military is moving into Hong Kong.
[03:00:25.291 --> 03:00:27.212]  Riot police are going into the airport.
[03:00:27.252 --> 03:00:28.233]  It's getting out of control.
[03:00:28.253 --> 03:00:29.495]  They're waving American flags.
[03:00:29.515 --> 03:00:30.616]  Pepe the frog signs.
[03:00:35.089 --> 03:00:43.691]  You just had the warden at the facility where Epstein died get reassigned and two of the guards placed on administrative leave.
[03:00:45.911 --> 03:00:51.133]  Now, we're going to continue to take your phone calls on the other side of this break, but I want to play these videos I meant to earlier.
[03:00:51.173 --> 03:00:57.354]  First, let's go to the Trump administration making the announcements about their new policy on green cards and public assistance.
[03:00:58.857 --> 03:01:14.837]  Today, USCIS, the agency I head as part of the Department of Homeland Security, has issued a rule that encourages and ensures self-reliance and self-sufficiency for those seeking to come to or to stay in the United States.
[03:01:15.831 --> 03:01:21.857]  It will also help promote immigrant success in the United States as they seek opportunity here.
[03:01:22.538 --> 03:01:37.934]  Through the public charge rule, President Trump's administration is reinforcing the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and become successful here in America.
[03:01:39.133 --> 03:01:47.866]  Our rule generally prevents aliens who are likely to become a public charge from coming to the United States or remaining here and getting a green card.
[03:01:48.947 --> 03:01:54.996]  Public charge is now defined in a way that ensures the law is meaningfully enforced
[03:01:55.715 --> 03:01:58.637]  And that those who are subject to it are self-sufficient.
[03:01:58.977 --> 03:02:04.340]  Critics are saying this policy is unfairly targeting the lower income immigrants.
[03:02:04.380 --> 03:02:05.400]  How do you respond to that?
[03:02:05.620 --> 03:02:09.702]  Well, we certainly expect people of any income to be able to stand on their own two feet.
[03:02:09.923 --> 03:02:22.189]  And so, if people are not able to be self-sufficient, then this negative factor is going to bear very heavily against them in a decision about whether they'll be able to become a legal permanent resident.
[03:02:24.490 --> 03:02:27.711]  A poor person can be prepared to be self-sufficient.
[03:02:28.231 --> 03:02:30.312]  Many have been through the history of this country.
[03:02:30.772 --> 03:02:33.453]  So, let's not look at that as the be-all and end-all.
[03:02:33.493 --> 03:02:39.074]  It's not the deciding factor, which is why we continue to use the totality of circumstances test.
[03:02:40.755 --> 03:02:43.116]  And so, this is just common sense.
[03:02:44.096 --> 03:02:46.017]  America is not a charity.
[03:02:46.637 --> 03:02:47.517]  We already give out
[03:02:49.096 --> 03:02:59.222]  Trillions over time, but hundreds of billions of dollars annually to all these countries for humanitarian aid, and then they just send all their people here and we pay for them again.
[03:02:59.282 --> 03:03:01.203]  So it's just a system that's totally failed us.
[03:03:01.263 --> 03:03:03.124]  Now, Kamala Harris.
[03:03:03.264 --> 03:03:04.585]  Boy, what a clown.
[03:03:06.205 --> 03:03:07.406]  First, let's go to this video.
[03:03:07.486 --> 03:03:08.427]  I don't even know what she's at.
[03:03:08.487 --> 03:03:09.627]  I guess the Iowa Fair.
[03:03:10.748 --> 03:03:13.149]  This is like meme-tastic in real time.
[03:03:13.249 --> 03:03:16.031]  Kamala Harris, I finally got my pork chop.
[03:03:22.546 --> 03:03:33.413]  I'm sorry!
[03:03:33.853 --> 03:03:35.694]  These people are just hilarious, man.
[03:03:36.915 --> 03:03:39.577]  They literally try to pander in any way they can.
[03:03:39.657 --> 03:03:45.821]  Changing a tire, riding a skateboard, going live in the dentist during an oral surgery.
[03:03:45.841 --> 03:03:46.902]  I mean, what a joke!
[03:03:47.637 --> 03:03:48.117]  Like, seriously.
[03:03:49.698 --> 03:03:51.940]  Part of me wants to go live during oral surgery.
[03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:54.382]  I'm, like, bleeding out from the mouth.
[03:03:54.562 --> 03:03:57.284]  My lips are, like, disgusting and, like, ripping apart.
[03:03:57.304 --> 03:03:58.184]  I'll be like, Hey, guys!
[03:03:58.765 --> 03:04:00.726]  I'm just doing a political show!
[03:04:00.746 --> 03:04:02.347]  It's like, wow.
[03:04:02.487 --> 03:04:03.568]  Are you okay?
[03:04:04.861 --> 03:04:07.721]  Like, oh no, they're just like ripping a hole in my head!
[03:04:08.242 --> 03:04:10.162]  I do have to have oral surgery in September.
[03:04:10.342 --> 03:04:11.622]  I have to get a tooth implant.
[03:04:11.662 --> 03:04:12.822]  So maybe I'll do it live.
[03:04:12.842 --> 03:04:14.403]  I'm going to do my tooth implant live.
[03:04:14.803 --> 03:04:16.083]  I'll be bleeding out of the mouth.
[03:04:16.183 --> 03:04:19.243]  I'll be stammering and stuttering on all kinds of drugs, probably.
[03:04:20.284 --> 03:04:21.724]  Drooling out of my mouth.
[03:04:22.044 --> 03:04:23.264]  Bleeding out of my mouth.
[03:04:23.324 --> 03:04:24.624]  The dentist will think I'm nuts.
[03:04:25.004 --> 03:04:26.965]  The oral surgeon will be like, and I'll be like, what?
[03:04:27.025 --> 03:04:27.925]  I saw Beto do it.
[03:04:27.965 --> 03:04:28.485]  It's cool.
[03:04:29.185 --> 03:04:29.645]  It's cool.
[03:04:29.665 --> 03:04:30.525]  All right, all right.
[03:04:31.305 --> 03:04:32.186]  I didn't even do it in time.
[03:04:32.406 --> 03:04:33.786]  I had too much fun making fun of Beto.
[03:04:34.775 --> 03:04:38.057]  Kamala Harris, maybe I'll play it before the end of the... Oh, I blew it.
[03:04:38.457 --> 03:04:50.325]  Kamala Harris went to a retirement home and she was talking about healthcare and some of the nice old ladies there said, please don't ruin our healthcare system.
[03:04:50.585 --> 03:04:55.308]  Kamala Harris goes there for a photo op and then the nice ladies there were like, yeah, please get out of here.
[03:04:55.869 --> 03:04:57.089]  Your plan for healthcare sucks.
[03:04:57.109 --> 03:04:57.890]  We can't afford this.
[03:04:57.930 --> 03:04:58.891]  You're ruining our healthcare.
[03:04:59.731 --> 03:05:00.472]  Bye Kamala.
[03:05:00.592 --> 03:05:00.932]  Bye bye.
[03:05:07.543 --> 03:05:15.049]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[03:05:15.549 --> 03:05:28.639]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[03:05:30.080 --> 03:05:33.641]  Trans-dimensionally over the space-time continuum through full space.
[03:05:33.902 --> 03:05:38.003]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[03:05:38.223 --> 03:05:40.364]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[03:05:43.015 --> 03:05:49.582]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women.
[03:05:49.802 --> 03:05:55.988]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[03:05:56.329 --> 03:05:57.930]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[03:05:58.351 --> 03:05:59.152]  It's fulfilling.
[03:05:59.352 --> 03:06:00.073]  InfoWars.
[03:06:00.453 --> 03:06:01.955]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[03:06:19.102 --> 03:06:26.487]  Alright, final hour of the Alex Jones Show, and we've got phone lines lit up.
[03:06:27.208 --> 03:06:28.889]  We're going to continue to take your phone calls.
[03:06:28.969 --> 03:06:29.950]  Be ready to go.
[03:06:31.511 --> 03:06:37.075]  Before I jump back out to the phone lines, remember, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:39.056 --> 03:06:45.001]  Have you switched your toothpaste to Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste yet?
[03:06:46.041 --> 03:06:46.782]  See, we make it easy.
[03:06:48.991 --> 03:06:49.712]  We're good to go.
[03:07:07.950 --> 03:07:10.572]  Saying, hey, look, everyone brushes their teeth.
[03:07:10.792 --> 03:07:13.213]  We sell toothbrushes and toothpaste.
[03:07:13.953 --> 03:07:15.474]  And to me, it's the best toothpaste going.
[03:07:15.494 --> 03:07:17.415]  I mean, there is no other toothpaste out there like it.
[03:07:17.595 --> 03:07:18.536]  It's fluoride free.
[03:07:19.537 --> 03:07:23.199]  And then it's got the nascent iodine and the colloidal silver in there.
[03:07:23.279 --> 03:07:27.021]  Very, obviously, the positive health benefits of those.
[03:07:28.775 --> 03:07:32.836]  So, check out Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste from InfoWareStore.com.
[03:07:33.376 --> 03:07:33.996]  Two flavors.

[03:07:54.822 --> 03:07:57.023]  It's a funny thing because people
[03:07:58.706 --> 03:08:03.887]  I've never really seen a shirt that gets political, so sometimes it's kind of just like a, whoa, I've never seen something like this.
[03:08:04.727 --> 03:08:05.307]  Interesting gift.
[03:08:05.347 --> 03:08:06.248]  I know I've given him this gift.
[03:08:06.268 --> 03:08:07.628]  So the stores at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:08:08.308 --> 03:08:09.448]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:08:09.508 --> 03:08:15.950]  Shop there today to keep InfoWars on the air tomorrow.
[03:08:16.490 --> 03:08:18.630]  Let me do this before I go to the phone lines.
[03:08:18.650 --> 03:08:19.331]  A couple stories here.
[03:08:19.591 --> 03:08:20.711]  I mentioned this last segment.
[03:08:21.537 --> 03:08:25.838]  FBI on the hunt for suspect who fired shots at ICE offices.
[03:08:26.118 --> 03:08:27.439]  This is coming out of San Antonio.
[03:08:27.559 --> 03:08:31.020]  Is Alexander Ocasio-Cortez one of the suspects here?
[03:08:31.040 --> 03:08:33.120]  I'm not sure.
[03:08:33.160 --> 03:08:34.320]  We'll have to find out.
[03:08:34.460 --> 03:08:35.501]  James O'Keefe, though.
[03:08:38.742 --> 03:08:43.863]  Tomorrow, our ML Fairness Google Insider comes out of the shadows.
[03:08:44.972 --> 03:08:47.193]  Over thousands of internal documents are released.
[03:08:47.273 --> 03:08:48.873]  Google might take this new video down.
[03:08:48.933 --> 03:08:52.534]  Sign up for our video list now, so you don't miss our latest on Google.
[03:08:53.074 --> 03:08:58.355]  So, Project Veritas is about to release their next bombshell report on Google.
[03:08:59.256 --> 03:09:08.338]  And, um, I happen to note that... I mean, folks, like... It's worse than the last one.
[03:09:10.318 --> 03:09:13.199]  It's worse than the last one.
[03:09:14.465 --> 03:09:20.510]  And the crazy thing is these higher ups at Google know how powerful what they're doing is.
[03:09:20.770 --> 03:09:25.594]  And some of them are like trying to check themselves and then the others are just frothing at the mouth.
[03:09:25.614 --> 03:09:30.918]  Uh, like the ring of, uh, from the Lord of the Rings or something.
[03:09:32.519 --> 03:09:33.560]  So that's all developing.
[03:09:33.700 --> 03:09:35.482]  Let's go back out to the phone lines though.
[03:09:36.162 --> 03:09:41.246]  And let's go to Anthony calling in from California.
[03:09:41.346 --> 03:09:42.067]  Go ahead, Anthony.
[03:09:43.627 --> 03:09:47.270]  Hey, this is a pretty intense thing for me.
[03:09:47.350 --> 03:10:01.803]  I've got a documentary I've been working on since 2015 called Homeowners, and it encompasses basically deepfakes, and some of the tools that were used were called Melodyne, and that was before the deepfake video was really a big thing.
[03:10:02.223 --> 03:10:08.609]  They were using audio, and what they had done is, these feminist man-haters here in Central California,
[03:10:09.079 --> 03:10:11.180]  We're punishing, actually, just InfoWars listeners.
[03:10:11.461 --> 03:10:12.381]  Kind of a side rant.
[03:10:12.741 --> 03:10:20.426]  I was thrown in jail on a 1370 specifically for running the InfoWars research team on Facebook before it was shut down.
[03:10:21.567 --> 03:10:23.828]  That's actually on the documents there.
[03:10:23.868 --> 03:10:36.456]  Anybody who will promote InfoWars or who uses them as an icon to the world is obviously incompetent and cannot be trusted with their own children.
[03:10:37.077 --> 03:10:42.018]  On a side note, also, I have with me, um, I'm a... Sorry, I'm about ready to cry.
[03:10:42.438 --> 03:10:44.358]  I'm a Mormon priest, a veteran of 23 years.
[03:10:44.418 --> 03:10:48.319]  I've spent my entire life traveling the world, the Ukraine, um, and other places.
[03:10:48.359 --> 03:10:51.380]  I've bought human trafficking victims with my own money and brought them to safety.
[03:10:51.780 --> 03:10:55.241]  I have a Mormon kid, 21 years old, here with me.
[03:10:56.221 --> 03:10:58.801]  And, uh, I'm working on this documentary that I have.
[03:10:59.481 --> 03:11:02.522]  Um, his mother works with Facebook as an accountant.
[03:11:03.226 --> 03:11:04.547]  And this was here in the last few weeks.
[03:11:04.628 --> 03:11:08.231]  I had had them admit these things that they'd been selling this foster child.
[03:11:09.412 --> 03:11:14.317]  So is there anywhere people can go access this information or see your documentary?
[03:11:15.316 --> 03:11:18.879]  Yes, I actually, I've requested these for several years.
[03:11:19.580 --> 03:11:28.448]  The Public Defender's Office is actually working on getting me the documents that list InfoWars Research Team as the complete sole justification for removing custody of children.
[03:11:29.328 --> 03:11:36.194]  So wait a second, I'm just, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but you're not, your message is kind of confusing me right now, so I imagine the audience is confused as well.
[03:11:37.135 --> 03:11:42.260]  Are you saying that you went to jail and had your kids taken from you because you posted about InfoWars?
[03:11:43.015 --> 03:11:44.635]  Yes, sir.
[03:11:45.016 --> 03:11:45.116]  In 2016.
[03:11:46.496 --> 03:11:50.737]  Now, now, now, again, you're trying to... Do you have this documentation?
[03:11:51.337 --> 03:11:51.557]  I do, 100%.
[03:11:51.797 --> 03:11:54.738]  And I will go to prison, let somebody execute me if I don't.
[03:11:57.338 --> 03:12:09.241]  Okay, well, I'm just saying, like, I don't really know how to handle this, because you're kind of throwing a bunch of stuff at me here, and, um... I mean, if you want this information out, I mean, like I said, is there, like a... Do you have a social media account?
[03:12:09.301 --> 03:12:12.482]  Is there anywhere we can go access this stuff so we can show what you're talking about here?
[03:12:13.140 --> 03:12:13.480]  Sorry, sir.
[03:12:13.741 --> 03:12:16.543]  Wolverine News Alliance is where I post most of my information.
[03:12:16.863 --> 03:12:23.289]  Like, currently we're on the lookout for a person who was convicted of sodomizing two infants and is running through Turlock.
[03:12:23.810 --> 03:12:27.353]  And that's what I send down these people on the streets as a street priest.
[03:12:27.373 --> 03:12:31.577]  So it's pretty complex, but if I narrow it down to the individual, no fat little things,
[03:12:32.117 --> 03:12:34.358]  Well, I'll tell you what, I gotta take another call.
[03:12:34.758 --> 03:12:40.440]  Guys, put him on hold and get his information, and if we can find this documentation, we may have interest in writing up a story.
[03:12:41.160 --> 03:12:45.442]  Yeah, if you're getting your kids taken from you and going to jail for posting about InfoWars.
[03:12:47.923 --> 03:12:49.703]  Yeah, that's pretty overwhelming stuff.
[03:12:49.803 --> 03:12:51.844]  Alright, let's go to Nick in Arizona.
[03:12:51.884 --> 03:12:52.564]  Go ahead, Nick.
[03:12:54.425 --> 03:12:54.645]  Hello?
[03:12:55.345 --> 03:12:55.565]  Hi.
[03:12:56.226 --> 03:12:56.506]  Hey there.
[03:12:57.066 --> 03:12:59.707]  So, Owen, I was listening to
[03:13:01.747 --> 03:13:08.332]  Uh, to the show this morning to Alex, and they were talking about Fredo Cuomo, and when he was on that video, he said he was an actor.
[03:13:08.892 --> 03:13:13.015]  I thought that was kind of an interesting thing, because I guess that CNN and MSNBC... Are you sure?
[03:13:13.035 --> 03:13:14.256]  I'm pretty sure he said anchor.
[03:13:14.857 --> 03:13:16.217]  It sounded like actor to me.
[03:13:16.778 --> 03:13:18.199]  Well, either way, he is an actor.
[03:13:18.806 --> 03:13:21.168]  Yeah, because everything they do is fictitious anyway, right?
[03:13:21.208 --> 03:13:21.908]  But isn't that the thing?
[03:13:22.048 --> 03:13:28.593]  See, that's the thing about that video that screams to me more than anything is just, like, we've all seen that guy before.
[03:13:28.713 --> 03:13:34.377]  Like, we've all seen the big tough guy who wants to puff up his chest and get all big and make a scene.
[03:13:34.417 --> 03:13:35.497]  That's what Cuomo was doing.
[03:13:35.998 --> 03:13:36.298]  Right.
[03:13:36.398 --> 03:13:39.560]  And the whole thing where they're saying, oh, he was being harassed, his family's being harassed.
[03:13:39.580 --> 03:13:40.381]  No, that's BS.
[03:13:40.741 --> 03:13:41.702]  I've seen a bunch of people stand up.
[03:13:41.742 --> 03:13:42.522]  That's not what happened.
[03:13:42.782 --> 03:13:43.903]  He was asked to take a picture.
[03:13:44.183 --> 03:13:45.784]  People ask me to take pictures all the time.
[03:13:45.844 --> 03:13:46.845]  People troll me all the time.
[03:13:46.885 --> 03:13:47.666]  I mean, give me a break.
[03:13:48.146 --> 03:13:52.067]  You know, so this whole thing, like, standing up for Cuomo, and I don't even care!
[03:13:52.307 --> 03:13:53.687]  The point is, he's a jerk!
[03:13:54.388 --> 03:13:55.468]  That's what the video shows.
[03:13:55.508 --> 03:13:57.048]  The guy is a jerk!
[03:13:58.589 --> 03:13:59.089]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:13:59.229 --> 03:14:14.193]  Well, and, you know, the other thing I saw yesterday, you guys were talking, or had somebody on the show that was talking about the Luciferians, and I ended up Googling a video on YouTube about them, and how they gain rank by doing vile things.
[03:14:15.768 --> 03:14:21.111]  So wouldn't that maybe be something that could have been a root cause for the Epstein death?
[03:14:23.733 --> 03:14:24.354]  What do you mean?
[03:14:25.414 --> 03:14:45.107]  Well, if the Luciferians are devil worshipers, or Satan worshipers, and if they do bad things to other people or to children or that type of thing, and Epstein wanted to get out per se, maybe he was a Luciferian, and somebody went and offed him, wouldn't they then gain rank within that crowd of people?
[03:14:46.997 --> 03:14:47.657]  Well, I don't know.
[03:14:47.697 --> 03:14:49.078]  I mean, probably not.
[03:14:49.218 --> 03:14:50.919]  I mean, this is an inside job.
[03:14:50.959 --> 03:14:52.719]  There's no way an outsider could have gotten in.
[03:14:52.739 --> 03:15:05.005]  I mean, you're looking at... Again, I mean, we're conspiracy theorizing here because we can't get the truth, but you're looking either at people inside getting paid off.
[03:15:05.085 --> 03:15:06.585]  There's an investigation going on right now.
[03:15:06.665 --> 03:15:08.526]  Two workers have already been put on administrative leave.
[03:15:09.006 --> 03:15:10.887]  The warden has already been transferred.
[03:15:11.408 --> 03:15:13.188]  So there's already an investigation going on.
[03:15:13.248 --> 03:15:14.609]  Maybe multiple people paid off.
[03:15:16.005 --> 03:15:20.850]  Uh, maybe this whole thing's a stunt, and he's, he really is being put into witness protection.
[03:15:20.870 --> 03:15:21.871]  I don't know!
[03:15:22.472 --> 03:15:30.100]  But, when everybody's, when everybody predicts that this guy's gonna end up dead, and then he ends up dead, and then we get no answers...
[03:15:31.032 --> 03:15:36.874]  You know, it's obvious that there's something happening here that really powerful people don't want us to know about.
[03:15:37.314 --> 03:15:50.578]  And so whenever that's going on, you know there's a major cover-up, and you know there's a major conspiracy, and you know that the American media that's bought and paid for is going to do everything they can to try to keep this story under wraps.
[03:15:50.678 --> 03:15:53.759]  Alright, more calls coming up.
[03:15:54.864 --> 03:15:55.865]  More calls coming up.
[03:15:55.905 --> 03:15:57.205]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:57.426 --> 03:16:00.988]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com during this break and take advantage of the big sale.
[03:16:02.349 --> 03:16:03.069]  Hi, I'm Dan.
[03:16:06.851 --> 03:16:08.312]  Let's go with Aaron in Alabama.
[03:16:08.352 --> 03:16:09.073]  Thanks for calling, Aaron.
[03:16:09.093 --> 03:16:09.593]  You're on the air.
[03:16:09.733 --> 03:16:10.113]  Hey, Alex.
[03:16:10.133 --> 03:16:14.356]  I want to say I've been in broadcasting, or I was, for about 15 years as a programmer.
[03:16:14.456 --> 03:16:16.938]  And to be honest, I hadn't heard of you until about six months ago.
[03:16:16.958 --> 03:16:18.659]  And I'm very thankful that I found you.
[03:16:18.699 --> 03:16:22.221]  You touch on a lot of stuff that I've felt in my heart and soul for my whole life.
[03:16:22.381 --> 03:16:23.582]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[03:16:23.642 --> 03:16:24.042]  Exactly.
[03:16:24.062 --> 03:16:25.063]  We're all kindred spirits.
[03:16:25.223 --> 03:16:25.803]  We really are.
[03:16:25.843 --> 03:16:26.243]  We really are.
[03:16:26.263 --> 03:16:27.925]  Listen, I've got a couple of points to make.
[03:16:27.945 --> 03:16:30.606]  But first, I've had body pain all over my entire life.
[03:16:30.746 --> 03:16:33.028]  And you know the product better than anybody there, I think.
[03:16:33.048 --> 03:16:34.089]  What would you recommend?
[03:16:34.249 --> 03:16:36.890]  I mean, literally, it's joints, it's muscle, it's everything.
[03:16:36.970 --> 03:16:38.752]  What would you recommend to me to purchase?
[03:16:38.792 --> 03:16:42.214]  You know, I think X2 or X3, because that's a building block to everything.
[03:16:42.234 --> 03:16:43.995]  And if you don't have that, the bad halogens take over.
[03:16:44.035 --> 03:16:46.256]  And I would think Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[03:16:46.316 --> 03:16:47.577]  Turmeric is amazing.
[03:16:47.617 --> 03:16:49.118]  This is a very strong extract.
[03:16:49.138 --> 03:16:50.279]  One of the strongest out there.
[03:16:50.299 --> 03:16:51.920]  Probably the strongest, but there may be one stronger.
[03:16:53.792 --> 03:16:56.234]  I would think Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus.
[03:16:56.394 --> 03:17:00.376]  They've all bombarded us with synthetic hormones that mess up our body.
[03:17:00.456 --> 03:17:13.285]  But then, if you get Preglanone, in my experience, I'm no doctor, I just talk to the scientists, with these other herbs like Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus, I think you should go through the products, every body is different, and test stuff out for yourself, and then just see what works best for you.
[03:17:13.325 --> 03:17:21.350]  But they're all super game-changing, the best we can get, the best labs, the cleanest, just like whatever is the most proven, the best, I go produce it.
[03:17:21.691 --> 03:17:22.011]  That's it.
[03:17:22.231 --> 03:17:23.492]  Because I would, I'm gonna say this again,
[03:17:23.952 --> 03:17:25.273]  I'm a very superstitious person.
[03:17:26.034 --> 03:17:27.035]  And by that, I'm God-fearing.
[03:17:27.675 --> 03:17:28.976]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[03:17:28.996 --> 03:17:30.077]  You've got my total commitment.
[03:17:30.317 --> 03:17:33.780]  Anything I do, information, any of it, products.
[03:17:33.880 --> 03:17:37.323]  Like, they went out and tested, third parties did, Alexa Pure and Pro Pure.
[03:17:37.443 --> 03:17:38.804]  Some are better at this, some are better at that.
[03:17:38.824 --> 03:17:43.047]  People are like, wow, we tested 30 gravity-fed filters and you have, like, the two best.
[03:17:43.327 --> 03:17:44.308]  Why'd I do that?
[03:17:44.448 --> 03:17:45.989]  What the hell do you think I'm doing?
[03:17:46.069 --> 03:17:49.332]  I go out and find out what is the best price for the best quality.
[03:17:49.352 --> 03:17:52.515]  Cause there's always like some space age $5,000 thing that's better.
[03:17:52.595 --> 03:17:55.618]  But I look at a line of like, what is the lowest price for the best benefit?
[03:17:55.738 --> 03:17:57.039]  And that's what I promote.
[03:17:57.159 --> 03:17:58.920]  So, so that's my advice on that.
[03:17:59.020 --> 03:17:59.301]  Go ahead.
[03:17:59.321 --> 03:17:59.541]  Sorry.
[03:17:59.921 --> 03:18:06.244]  Well, and I appreciate that, and I can tell just from the way you talk about the product, I feel like I can trust you that you kind of do things the way I do.
[03:18:06.284 --> 03:18:08.204]  You either do it right the first time, or just don't do it.
[03:18:08.324 --> 03:18:09.765]  And I feel like I can trust you on your product.
[03:18:09.785 --> 03:18:12.566]  Well, now listen, don't trust me, because here's the deal.
[03:18:12.806 --> 03:18:17.008]  You need to talk to a physician, you need to research, because the iodine conspiracy is everything.
[03:18:17.228 --> 03:18:18.770]  Most people have almost none of it.
[03:18:18.790 --> 03:18:21.814]  But if you've had none of it for 20 years, you take a bunch, you can have some issues.
[03:18:21.974 --> 03:18:23.135]  Detoxing, you name it.
[03:18:23.195 --> 03:18:25.838]  I mean, this stuff, this is it, man.
[03:18:25.999 --> 03:18:27.400]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[03:18:27.540 --> 03:18:28.181]  It's dangerous.
[03:18:28.381 --> 03:18:31.065]  Because it's an element you've got to have, they've taken away from you.
[03:18:31.165 --> 03:18:33.007]  Well, what happens when you finally get it?
[03:18:33.067 --> 03:18:33.708]  You've got to be careful.
[03:18:33.848 --> 03:18:37.610]  Because if you've not had this, your body will take in bromine, chloride, fluoride.
[03:18:37.710 --> 03:18:39.231]  There's a whole bunch of bad halogens.
[03:18:40.411 --> 03:18:41.952]  Your organs, everything operates.
[03:18:42.132 --> 03:18:44.294]  Your hormones are produced with halogen.
[03:18:44.414 --> 03:18:47.995]  And so the globalists have been targeting that with bad halogens that block it.
[03:18:48.076 --> 03:18:49.016]  So this is the good thing.
[03:18:49.056 --> 03:18:52.018]  But like anybody knows, it's like being punched in the kick in the head by a mule.
[03:18:52.038 --> 03:18:53.298]  It's like, oh, that's the real thing.
[03:18:53.358 --> 03:18:54.219]  Yeah, that's the mule.
[03:18:54.359 --> 03:18:56.260]  So I'm just telling people, this X2 isn't a joke.
[03:18:56.380 --> 03:18:58.041]  We just researched what the globalists are doing.
[03:18:58.201 --> 03:18:58.981]  We do the opposite.
[03:18:59.021 --> 03:19:00.142]  But yes, everyone
[03:19:00.302 --> 03:19:04.703]  With X2, X3, you need to consult a physician, because you're like, oh, that's just Mother Nature.
[03:19:04.763 --> 03:19:05.744]  Yeah, Mother Nature.
[03:19:05.864 --> 03:19:09.605]  The drug companies and all the stuff they do is a counterfeit of what God's already given us, OK?
[03:19:09.625 --> 03:19:10.705]  So I'm going to explain it again.
[03:19:10.785 --> 03:19:12.886]  Without iodine, you die.
[03:19:12.906 --> 03:19:14.426]  The fields are depleted.
[03:19:14.586 --> 03:19:15.366]  Everything's depleted.
[03:19:15.566 --> 03:19:21.048]  Most iodine is bound to iron, copper, or lead, or something else.
[03:19:21.108 --> 03:19:21.968]  You don't get it.
[03:19:22.128 --> 03:19:24.669]  Pure iodine is explosive.
[03:19:24.949 --> 03:19:25.949]  So yeah, be careful.
[03:19:26.109 --> 03:19:27.410]  Iodine, you have to have.
[03:19:28.130 --> 03:19:29.891]  It's just paramount.
[03:19:30.492 --> 03:19:32.353]  And so, that's why we sell it.
[03:19:32.413 --> 03:19:33.454]  That's why we've hyped it up.
[03:19:33.534 --> 03:19:35.935]  Because it's what they don't want you to have.
[03:19:35.955 --> 03:19:40.819]  But yeah, if you've been off of it and not had iodine for your whole life, it's like you've never been in a boxing ring.
[03:19:41.039 --> 03:19:45.222]  And you get in the ring with Mike Tyson, your body's gonna be like, what the hell is that?
[03:19:45.482 --> 03:19:46.803]  Because you've never had it.
[03:19:47.003 --> 03:19:47.883]  It's just iodine.
[03:19:47.963 --> 03:19:49.685]  It's the magic sauce, folks.
[03:19:57.910 --> 03:19:59.411]  You win and you know I love those.
[03:20:06.113 --> 03:20:08.754]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.374 --> 03:20:24.055]  Big Brother.
[03:20:24.515 --> 03:20:25.737]  Mainstream media.
[03:20:26.297 --> 03:20:27.438]  Government cover-ups.
[03:20:28.219 --> 03:20:29.640]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:20:29.901 --> 03:20:31.022]  Well, so does he.
[03:20:31.542 --> 03:20:36.287]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:36.668 --> 03:20:39.671]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:20:57.533 --> 03:20:59.394]  All right, we're taking your phone calls here.
[03:20:59.994 --> 03:21:01.435]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:21:01.455 --> 03:21:03.976]  Let me pepper in a couple headlines here.
[03:21:05.637 --> 03:21:06.137]  See this one.
[03:21:06.897 --> 03:21:10.859]  Russia opens antitrust inquiry into app restrictions at Apple.
[03:21:10.879 --> 03:21:15.601]  And then this is kind of funny because
[03:21:17.145 --> 03:21:21.186]  There's this whole twist, like... It's just like, the media just hates Russia.
[03:21:21.206 --> 03:21:25.488]  I don't understand, but... Here's a story.
[03:21:25.768 --> 03:21:32.290]  The headline is, Russia tells Google not to advertise illegal events after election protest.
[03:21:34.971 --> 03:21:40.233]  Now, the real story here is that Russia knows what Google is doing.
[03:21:41.133 --> 03:21:42.314]  And they're saying, stop it.
[03:21:43.530 --> 03:22:02.345]  It's like if President Trump came out and said, hey Google, as a new Project Veritas video is about to drop, President Trump comes out and says, hey Google, stop meddling in US elections by rigging search results, and then they say, America tells Google not to advertise.
[03:22:03.612 --> 03:22:05.033]  That's basically what they're saying about Russia.
[03:22:05.073 --> 03:22:11.377]  No, Google is in Russia trying to manipulate a bunch of protests and foment a bunch of riots and stuff.
[03:22:12.158 --> 03:22:13.699]  And so Russia's just saying, knock it off.
[03:22:14.899 --> 03:22:17.821]  But you know, Russia's... Russia's not allowed to exist.
[03:22:19.322 --> 03:22:20.603]  Alright, let's go back to your phone calls.
[03:22:22.705 --> 03:22:27.508]  And let's start with... Let's start with... Let's go to Jeff in Canada.
[03:22:27.548 --> 03:22:28.108]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[03:22:30.149 --> 03:22:30.810]  Hey, good day, Owen.
[03:22:31.531 --> 03:22:35.974]  Hey, I got a point about Epstein, but something else I wanted to just touch on.
[03:22:36.594 --> 03:22:41.136]  I was thinking about Fredo today, and it was really gnawing at me.
[03:22:42.057 --> 03:22:43.338]  Who does he remind me of?
[03:22:43.618 --> 03:22:44.338]  And then it hit me.
[03:22:45.239 --> 03:22:45.859]  It's Lefto.
[03:22:46.880 --> 03:22:48.581]  He totally reminds me of Lefto.
[03:22:49.381 --> 03:22:50.262]  Lefto the clown?
[03:22:51.502 --> 03:22:52.483]  Lefto the clown, yeah.
[03:22:52.563 --> 03:22:54.064]  My buddy, Lefto the clown.
[03:22:54.804 --> 03:22:56.025]  Yeah, I think you guys should
[03:22:56.704 --> 03:23:01.148]  You know, approach Fredo and see if you guys can hook it up and take it on the road.
[03:23:01.628 --> 03:23:02.068]  What do you think?
[03:23:03.690 --> 03:23:07.713]  Maybe they can do like a workout video or something and see if they use the same steroids.
[03:23:08.634 --> 03:23:10.035]  Yeah, like Spug Life.
[03:23:10.676 --> 03:23:13.218]  I like the Happys, too.
[03:23:13.258 --> 03:23:15.239]  You know, there's lots of possibilities there, man.
[03:23:17.501 --> 03:23:19.283]  I mean, I think Chris Cuomo feels bad.
[03:23:19.783 --> 03:23:21.625]  I wonder if he wasn't intoxicated.
[03:23:22.565 --> 03:23:25.288]  But seriously, the guy behaved like a jerk.
[03:23:26.229 --> 03:23:26.870]  And you know what?
[03:23:26.910 --> 03:23:27.510]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:23:27.610 --> 03:23:33.236]  I think everybody has seen a guy like that before or a moment like that before and it's just like, wow, like you're just an embarrassment.
[03:23:33.316 --> 03:23:35.798]  Like you're just a, you're just a rude jerk.
[03:23:37.880 --> 03:23:39.022]  CIA operative thing.
[03:23:39.062 --> 03:23:41.344]  I think that it's hashtag afraid of the clown.
[03:23:42.125 --> 03:23:42.585]  I don't know.
[03:23:43.663 --> 03:23:44.483]  Fredo Cuomo.
[03:23:44.923 --> 03:23:45.884]  Fake news Fredo.
[03:23:46.224 --> 03:23:47.544]  But now he's Fredo forever.
[03:23:47.865 --> 03:23:50.866]  Now I bet if you plug in Google, it's probably nothing but Chris Cuomo.
[03:23:51.186 --> 03:23:55.367]  It probably used to be, like two days ago, you plug Fredo into Google, you get Fredo.
[03:23:55.787 --> 03:23:57.848]  Now you plug Fredo into Google, you get Chris Cuomo.
[03:23:58.068 --> 03:24:01.089]  By the way, is this total proof of the simulation?
[03:24:01.609 --> 03:24:05.391]  Yesterday was the actor who played Fredo's birthday.
[03:24:05.411 --> 03:24:08.472]  Anything else, Jeff?
[03:24:12.423 --> 03:24:12.663]  Yeah.
[03:24:12.743 --> 03:24:13.604]  Point about Epstein.
[03:24:14.064 --> 03:24:17.545]  Um, you know, magically all the time.
[03:24:18.186 --> 03:24:20.787]  It happens that these CCTV cameras aren't working.
[03:24:20.847 --> 03:24:22.968]  It happened with Seth Rich.
[03:24:23.088 --> 03:24:23.928]  What happened to him?
[03:24:24.069 --> 03:24:25.049]  And Jesse Smollett.
[03:24:25.109 --> 03:24:32.793]  And it's always these these cameras that just magically go down when something big is happening.
[03:24:33.333 --> 03:24:41.357]  And I think, you know, maybe look at the angle of like racist camera manufacturers or something, you know, there's something else to that.
[03:24:41.477 --> 03:24:41.617]  So
[03:24:42.389 --> 03:24:50.355]  I don't know, I think it's, uh, there's some other angle with the camera manufacturers, how they, they, uh... There's nothing to see here, Jeff.
[03:24:51.015 --> 03:24:54.057]  There's nothing to see here with Seth Rich, the media told me.
[03:24:54.077 --> 03:24:57.540]  There's nothing to see here with Jeffrey Epstein, the media told me.
[03:24:58.481 --> 03:25:02.303]  So you just take those conspiracy theorists and stuff them in a sock, mister.
[03:25:02.323 --> 03:25:05.185]  Alright, let's go to Carlos in Canada.
[03:25:05.205 --> 03:25:05.966]  Go ahead, Carlos.
[03:25:07.503 --> 03:25:08.223]  Thank you very much.
[03:25:09.144 --> 03:25:13.066]  I have a report that I wanted to give to Alex a few days back.
[03:25:13.546 --> 03:25:18.228]  And in the interim, of course, Jeffrey Epstein's demise.
[03:25:18.608 --> 03:25:22.670]  But I wanted to bring it to your attention today because it's very relevant.
[03:25:23.030 --> 03:25:25.691]  There are a lot of conspiracy theories out there floating around.
[03:25:26.012 --> 03:25:27.992]  And fortunately, I'm from Montreal.
[03:25:28.493 --> 03:25:35.116]  And I'm from the Bronfman Territory here, where a lot of these, you want to call it, honey traps,
[03:25:36.112 --> 03:25:36.272]  Yes.
[03:26:03.317 --> 03:26:10.998]  Honey traps were not like standard Mossad operations like Jonathan Pollard with a headliner like Rafi Eitan.
[03:26:11.839 --> 03:26:21.000]  Rather, these operations were handled very much from the Prime Minister's office or someone who was ex-Prime Minister like Ehud Barak.
[03:26:21.520 --> 03:26:29.962]  Now, you have individuals who are very pro-Israel and they're very cooperative, as you would have with, for example, Edgar Bronfman or Mr. Leslie
[03:26:34.833 --> 03:26:36.054]  Yes, yes.
[03:26:36.654 --> 03:26:41.558]  Other individuals that were fomenting and encouraging intelligence gathering.
[03:26:42.599 --> 03:27:00.412]  Jeffrey Ntsi was running a very high-level operation and I began to notice this when Ghislaine Maxwell was mentioned because I had researched Robert Maxwell and his relationship with Mossad and here we now find the continuance all along of that
[03:27:01.021 --> 03:27:06.744]  Basically sets up one, not only one, but several honey traps.
[03:27:07.645 --> 03:27:10.627]  One of them was General Petraeus and Paula Broadwell.
[03:27:11.107 --> 03:27:17.450]  If you Google Gilad Online writings, Israel Petraeus was unfaithful to us.
[03:27:17.971 --> 03:27:26.996]  There is a report from a high-level Israeli, initials were BB, fortunately says,
[03:27:27.577 --> 03:27:35.381]  Paula Broadwell came to Israel as part of a cadet exchange program when she was at West Point and ended up in a position to help.
[03:27:35.861 --> 03:27:40.423]  These exchange programs with the military and law enforcement are really paying off.
[03:27:41.317 --> 03:27:42.398]  Now this, we don't know.
[03:27:42.418 --> 03:27:46.520]  Well look, there's no doubt, I mean we got it from the Nixivim's sex cult too.
[03:27:46.800 --> 03:27:50.982]  And I'm sure you could go on for days with your report here.
[03:27:51.062 --> 03:27:53.163]  I don't have the days and I got other callers to get to.
[03:27:53.883 --> 03:28:03.508]  But yes, what we know is there's major blackmail lists, there's major intel operations, Epstein is connected to all of them.
[03:28:04.444 --> 03:28:13.591]  And, you know, you just wonder at a certain level how independent Epstein was from this or how much he was blackmailed himself, potentially, into doing this.
[03:28:13.651 --> 03:28:16.333]  He was just so in deep with it all that he had to do it too.
[03:28:16.353 --> 03:28:20.877]  But yes, intelligence agencies using honeypots and honey traps to get information.
[03:28:20.937 --> 03:28:23.359]  It's what they tried to do to George Papadopoulos.
[03:28:24.880 --> 03:28:33.647]  And then, with people like Epstein, they just have lavish parties and they get, you know, powerful men or women in compromising situations.
[03:28:34.775 --> 03:28:42.161]  Maybe under the influence, and then you've got potential blackmail, or you invite them into another situation where you can really get them with even worse blackmail.
[03:28:45.123 --> 03:28:48.386]  So, uh... Yeah, it's crazy world.
[03:28:48.426 --> 03:28:50.587]  Some of it's coming out right now, this whole Epstein thing.
[03:28:51.128 --> 03:28:54.110]  But we have to continue to report on it, otherwise it'll just disappear.
[03:28:54.130 --> 03:28:56.972]  Alright, we'll take more calls on the other side of this break.
[03:28:57.012 --> 03:28:58.253]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:58.293 --> 03:29:00.255]  During this break, go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:29:03.166 --> 03:29:14.051]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[03:29:14.611 --> 03:29:17.152]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:29:17.513 --> 03:29:20.494]  No one can doubt that InfoWars has changed the world.
[03:29:21.034 --> 03:29:30.679]  The globalists give us credit for discrediting their world government system, their neoliberal fascist plan, and infecting, in their words,
[03:29:31.639 --> 03:29:34.321]  The entire world was nationalism.
[03:29:34.602 --> 03:29:36.103]  Now, how did I do that?
[03:29:37.264 --> 03:29:38.385]  I did that because of you.
[03:29:38.965 --> 03:29:39.526]  We did that.
[03:29:40.006 --> 03:29:40.566]  You did that.
[03:29:40.586 --> 03:29:43.309]  We're either going to have freedom or we're going to have slavery.
[03:29:44.009 --> 03:29:47.452]  And these corporatists play nation states off against each other.
[03:29:48.013 --> 03:29:49.434]  They play men and women off against each other.
[03:29:49.454 --> 03:29:52.056]  They play people off against each other for what color their skin is.
[03:29:53.117 --> 03:29:56.299]  But the people of the world more and more are seeing through it.
[03:29:57.340 --> 03:29:59.202]  And that's why I want all of you right now
[03:30:00.396 --> 03:30:15.488]  As the world government falls apart, as the New World Order hits the panic button and tries to start a race war, to realize that we have come so far, and that all these globalists have now is trying to stir up internal information warfare fights.
[03:30:16.469 --> 03:30:25.036]  But we knew history, and knew that these globalists are arrogant, and there would come a time when their system would enter a crisis.
[03:30:25.976 --> 03:30:27.438]  When it actually tried to implement
[03:30:28.692 --> 03:30:31.939]  It's incredibly anti-human agenda.
[03:30:33.001 --> 03:30:35.987]  You know, I don't spend valuable time on air.
[03:30:37.248 --> 03:30:48.914]  Showing you the infrastructure here, showing you what goes into it, showing you how much money it costs to run this and do this, especially since we were de-platformed one year ago today.
[03:30:49.194 --> 03:30:55.398]  That's why we're calling it the one-year anniversary of the first domino to be unpersoned, to be sent into a black hole, the Phantom Zone.
[03:30:55.478 --> 03:30:57.419]  But the globalists did it too early!
[03:30:57.439 --> 03:31:04.903]  There's still talk radio, there's still TV, there's still independent websites like Infowars.com and Newswars.com that are on the air.
[03:31:06.043 --> 03:31:17.008]  And people have word of mouth to say, hey, just because you can't say Alex Jones's name on Facebook, unless it's a negative statement, or can't show InfoWars.com, you can tell your office about InfoWars.com.
[03:31:17.528 --> 03:31:19.429]  You can tell your neighbors about NewsWars.com.
[03:31:20.069 --> 03:31:22.030]  You could share our videos and our articles.
[03:31:22.070 --> 03:31:22.750]  We have our own site.
[03:31:22.770 --> 03:31:23.530]  We have our own platform.
[03:31:24.731 --> 03:31:27.192]  That's the beauty of what's happening here.
[03:31:27.252 --> 03:31:30.433]  That's the beauty of what's unfolding.
[03:31:31.113 --> 03:31:32.174]  And it's a real fight.
[03:31:33.328 --> 03:31:38.671]  And things aren't going to go the way this whole synthetic technocracy want them to go, because you've been standing in the gap.
[03:31:39.471 --> 03:31:40.371]  You've been spreading the word.
[03:31:40.952 --> 03:31:41.592]  You've been praying.
[03:31:42.212 --> 03:31:43.573]  You've been supporting this transmission.
[03:31:43.653 --> 03:31:44.813]  You've been buying products from us.
[03:31:44.833 --> 03:31:47.054]  So it's the one-year anniversary.

[03:31:56.079 --> 03:31:56.939]  Double Patriot points.
[03:31:57.059 --> 03:31:59.321]  And there's a bunch of other big specials on storable food.
[03:31:59.501 --> 03:32:02.244]  Anniversary sale at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:32:11.073 --> 03:32:13.916]  It is such a revolutionary act to keep this broadcast on air.
[03:32:14.136 --> 03:32:19.880]  It is such a revolutionary act every time you put a bumper sticker on your car or paint Infowars.com on the side of your barn.
[03:32:20.041 --> 03:32:21.622]  Every time you stand up to leftist bullies.
[03:32:21.782 --> 03:32:22.983]  Every time you tell the truth.
[03:32:23.143 --> 03:32:27.646]  Every time you keep this symbol of free speech and pro-human values alive.
[03:32:27.666 --> 03:32:30.709]  The enemy comes one step closer to their system falling.
[03:32:30.869 --> 03:32:34.472]  We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[03:32:35.252 --> 03:32:39.335]  And now we've got a fighting chance if we all take action of defeating the globalists.
[03:32:39.736 --> 03:32:40.216]  Stay with us.
[03:32:40.436 --> 03:32:41.037]  We'll be right back.
[03:32:41.437 --> 03:32:42.678]  But please take advantage of the sale.
[03:33:05.535 --> 03:33:11.617]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:27.664 --> 03:33:31.105]  There are major developments happening in Hong Kong right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:33:34.620 --> 03:33:40.843]  And what it means for the global power structure, we can only wait and see.
[03:33:43.183 --> 03:33:52.187]  You also had a major nuclear test explosion in Russia, and they're evacuating that area.
[03:33:52.667 --> 03:33:59.470]  You had a stabbing happen in Sydney, where the guy is screaming, Allahu Akbar, stabbing people, and then taken down by some brave citizens.
[03:34:02.148 --> 03:34:03.149]  But don't worry, folks.
[03:34:03.729 --> 03:34:13.275]  All is well, because the University of London is going to ban all beef burgers and become carbon neutral by 2025.
[03:34:13.715 --> 03:34:16.217]  So congratulations.
[03:34:16.877 --> 03:34:23.241]  All right, let's go back out to the phone lines and go to Dean in Virginia.
[03:34:23.261 --> 03:34:24.142]  Go ahead, Dean.
[03:34:25.623 --> 03:34:30.826]  Hello, all you Paul Revere juniors out there spreading the word of InfoWars.
[03:34:31.514 --> 03:34:33.794]  And I want to thank you guys for being the tip of the spear.
[03:34:33.815 --> 03:34:36.715]  It's kept me motivated for over 15 years.
[03:34:37.895 --> 03:34:48.978]  But what's amazing is, you've got the highest valued witness ever, and they put him in a rinky-dink little jail with allegedly 24-hour surveillance.
[03:34:50.038 --> 03:34:50.658]  Well, I don't know.
[03:34:50.678 --> 03:34:52.618]  You can't really call this a rinky-dink jail.
[03:34:52.718 --> 03:34:53.899]  El Chapo was there.
[03:34:53.999 --> 03:34:55.699]  You've had ISIS terrorists there.
[03:34:55.719 --> 03:34:58.300]  I think Bernie Madoff may have even stayed there.
[03:34:58.320 --> 03:35:00.360]  I mean, it's a high-profile jail.
[03:35:01.559 --> 03:35:01.839]  Okay.
[03:35:02.660 --> 03:35:08.542]  Now you've got the guy that can bring down the entire Democratic Party and then some.
[03:35:09.562 --> 03:35:11.263]  I would have put him someplace a little different.
[03:35:12.364 --> 03:35:18.626]  But be that as it may, when you're talking about global domination, you've got to get rid of the people that can bring it down.
[03:35:18.646 --> 03:35:29.411]  But I'm really surprised with him that he did not, or maybe he had, created some kind of documentary about himself and videotaped occasionally.
[03:35:30.482 --> 03:35:40.165]  Everybody involved with his parties and or flights and or island trips, just for safekeeping that if and when anything were to happen to me.
[03:35:41.525 --> 03:35:41.945]  What do you think?
[03:35:43.586 --> 03:35:48.087]  Yeah, the dead man switch that we never saw, he had a little black book, they've recovered that.
[03:35:49.408 --> 03:35:52.528]  Who knows what they have, I mean look, we get nothing.
[03:35:52.849 --> 03:35:55.209]  We're the American people, we pay for the whole thing, we get nothing.
[03:35:55.669 --> 03:35:57.450]  Except a bunch of questions and a bunch of lies.
[03:35:58.772 --> 03:36:00.093]  And no justice, seemingly.
[03:36:00.473 --> 03:36:00.993]  But we'll see.
[03:36:01.033 --> 03:36:01.433]  I mean, look.
[03:36:03.034 --> 03:36:03.734]  It's showtime.
[03:36:04.294 --> 03:36:05.215]  It's showtime, Dean.
[03:36:05.795 --> 03:36:06.395]  Thanks for the call.
[03:36:06.415 --> 03:36:09.837]  Let's go to Peter calling in from New Orleans.
[03:36:09.897 --> 03:36:10.457]  The Big Easy.
[03:36:10.497 --> 03:36:11.257]  Go ahead, Peter.
[03:36:11.938 --> 03:36:12.558]  Hey, Owen.
[03:36:12.578 --> 03:36:13.278]  This is Peter.
[03:36:13.598 --> 03:36:14.099]  Love you guys.
[03:36:14.139 --> 03:36:14.959]  Love InfoWars.
[03:36:15.535 --> 03:36:17.597]  But I gotta tell you, I'm really angry.
[03:36:17.677 --> 03:36:24.722]  I don't know about the other info warriors around the country, but for me to get the highest valued asset in U.S.
[03:36:24.762 --> 03:36:31.628]  history and hearing that he got killed in jail under the Trump administration is like losing Kennedy's brain.
[03:36:32.989 --> 03:36:37.052]  I find it hard to believe, you know, and I want you guys to hold Trump's feet to the fire.
[03:36:37.613 --> 03:36:38.894]  He was strangled once.
[03:36:39.494 --> 03:36:44.018]  There was one attempted suicide or strangle, and he didn't get him out of there.
[03:36:46.087 --> 03:36:53.614]  Well, I would, I mean, I mean, you want to be fair, but I don't even think if this was under Obama, I'd be blaming Obama.
[03:36:53.694 --> 03:36:56.016]  I'm looking at Attorney General Barr.
[03:36:56.236 --> 03:37:02.162]  If I'm pointing the finger at anybody, I'm saying Attorney General Barr should have been the one to do something about this.
[03:37:02.862 --> 03:37:07.987]  I would have had him either chained to my ankle or chained to my bedpost.
[03:37:08.567 --> 03:37:10.329]  So basically, you know, he's under my 24-7 surveillance.
[03:37:13.792 --> 03:37:17.533]  Now you have to open up new investigations to see how he was killed.
[03:37:17.873 --> 03:37:19.114]  Of course, if that's even what happened.
[03:37:19.134 --> 03:37:20.554]  Again, I'm not even convinced that's what happened.
[03:37:20.754 --> 03:37:21.815]  They could have body-switched him.
[03:37:21.855 --> 03:37:22.555]  I mean, who knows?
[03:37:22.575 --> 03:37:23.655]  It's so crazy.
[03:37:24.536 --> 03:37:28.437]  As far as your anger is concerned, look, everybody's angry.
[03:37:28.457 --> 03:37:35.680]  I mean, but... We've been sitting here covering mainstream lies for decades, so it's just like par for the course for us.
[03:37:36.620 --> 03:37:40.901]  Where's the rest of America that is finally waking up, realizing they've been lied to for so long?
[03:37:41.502 --> 03:37:42.522]  That's my question.
[03:37:48.027 --> 03:37:48.887]  All right, thanks for the call.
[03:37:48.907 --> 03:37:50.868]  Let's go to Ernie in Wisconsin.
[03:37:50.908 --> 03:37:51.568]  Go ahead, Ernie.
[03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:09.533]  So what I want to see, and it is happening, it's kind of like, you know, certain events, red pill people.
[03:38:09.573 --> 03:38:11.774]  This is a major red pill opportunity right here.
[03:38:12.754 --> 03:38:12.914]  And
[03:38:14.019 --> 03:38:24.163]  Everybody just needs to be talking about it, taking action, doing viral videos, talking to their friends and family, talking about it at your local church group, your Bible study, your coffee, your book club, whatever.
[03:38:27.325 --> 03:38:37.469]  So, this story doesn't go away and they cannot cover up this industrial-level pedophilia that implicates some of the most powerful names.
[03:38:38.969 --> 03:38:40.190]  Alright, let's go to James.
[03:38:40.390 --> 03:38:41.691]  Let's go to James in Oklahoma.
[03:38:41.711 --> 03:38:42.331]  Go ahead, James.
[03:38:43.905 --> 03:38:45.585]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call, dude.
[03:38:45.605 --> 03:38:46.586]  Appreciate it very much.
[03:38:46.786 --> 03:38:47.726]  Long time listener.
[03:38:47.766 --> 03:38:48.606]  First time caller.
[03:38:49.526 --> 03:38:49.926]  Hey, man.
[03:38:49.946 --> 03:38:51.507]  Touched on the Ed Steen thing.
[03:38:51.527 --> 03:38:53.727]  Just kind of going out on a limb.
[03:38:53.807 --> 03:39:02.389]  Not sure how far they can go with this, but maybe we can start looking into some legalities on what we can hold those guys that were watching and surveilling Ed Steen.
[03:39:02.950 --> 03:39:04.410]  You know, hold them accountable for negligence.
[03:39:04.430 --> 03:39:05.230]  Well, they already are.
[03:39:05.250 --> 03:39:06.650]  Yeah, that's already happening.
[03:39:07.151 --> 03:39:12.172]  Two of the people involved in that have been put on leave, and the warden has been
[03:39:13.152 --> 03:39:14.193]  Move to a new facility.
[03:39:15.413 --> 03:39:15.614]  Right.
[03:39:15.634 --> 03:39:16.314]  I understand that.
[03:39:16.334 --> 03:39:18.475]  But I'm saying hold it up to where we can see it.
[03:39:18.575 --> 03:39:20.817]  Let's see how they're going to, you know, try them.
[03:39:20.897 --> 03:39:22.058]  What's going to be coming of this?
[03:39:22.138 --> 03:39:24.119]  If they're going to flip flop, they're going to say, Hey, look.
[03:39:24.839 --> 03:39:29.082]  Something happened because obviously, like the previous caller said, there was already one try on him.
[03:39:29.222 --> 03:39:30.002]  We should have moved him.
[03:39:30.042 --> 03:39:30.443]  We didn't.
[03:39:30.883 --> 03:39:31.744]  They've already got names.
[03:39:31.804 --> 03:39:33.385]  We know that there's plenty of names he has.
[03:39:33.445 --> 03:39:34.305]  He's already released them.
[03:39:34.365 --> 03:39:36.066]  So there's plenty of people shaking in their boots.
[03:39:36.747 --> 03:39:38.027]  Man, it'd be nice to get them all.
[03:39:38.208 --> 03:39:38.848]  It really would.
[03:39:40.939 --> 03:39:44.100]  Dead men tell no tales, and we get no answers.
[03:39:44.580 --> 03:39:44.880]  Really.
[03:39:45.100 --> 03:39:47.001]  That's the pathetic thing about it all.
[03:39:48.041 --> 03:39:48.901]  Thanks for everything, guys.
[03:39:48.921 --> 03:39:49.602]  Appreciate you.
[03:39:50.002 --> 03:39:50.222]  Yep.
[03:39:50.342 --> 03:39:51.122]  Thank you for the call.
[03:39:51.242 --> 03:39:54.023]  Let's go now to Eric in Colorado.
[03:39:54.103 --> 03:39:54.763]  Go ahead, Eric.
[03:39:56.544 --> 03:39:57.064]  Hello, Owen.
[03:39:57.084 --> 03:39:57.984]  Hello.
[03:39:59.165 --> 03:39:59.465]  Hey there.
[03:39:59.485 --> 03:39:59.885]  How you doing?
[03:40:00.765 --> 03:40:01.605]  Well, I'm doing great, Eric.
[03:40:02.946 --> 03:40:03.566]  Fantastic.
[03:40:04.186 --> 03:40:09.668]  Well, thanks for giving me the opportunity to send out prayers for everybody all over the planet to finally taste some freedom.
[03:40:10.464 --> 03:40:31.754]  I wanted to talk about the word conspiracy and how it is lodged in the collective unconscious incorrectly and maybe like saying plan when we're talking about a plan would help people get along because I notice people like stumble on the word when they say it and some people think that it means something theoretical together not even something real.
[03:40:33.935 --> 03:40:38.877]  But that's my whole beef it's like so you're saying there's never been a conspiracy throughout the history of mankind?
[03:40:40.433 --> 03:40:49.136]  Even if a conspiracy is accurately describing a plan in conversation, linguistically, things have been broken for some people in how they understand words.
[03:40:49.236 --> 03:40:55.818]  Lots of people are somewhat illiterate, not understanding words like anarchy, meaning no rulers, not meaning no rules.
[03:40:56.318 --> 03:40:58.819]  Anomy, A-N-O-M-I-E, means no rules.
[03:40:59.299 --> 03:41:00.539]  Anarchy means no rulers.
[03:41:00.999 --> 03:41:04.380]  Kind of like, in my opinion, you know, term limits.
[03:41:05.121 --> 03:41:06.081]  That's kind of like anarchy.
[03:41:07.068 --> 03:41:08.449]  Rulers, they're just there for a little while.
[03:41:08.789 --> 03:41:09.509]  Because we want them there.
[03:41:09.849 --> 03:41:10.449]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:41:12.070 --> 03:41:20.753]  I'm just saying, anybody who gets this response, like if you say, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist, well, my response is, so what are you?
[03:41:21.273 --> 03:41:22.273]  You're a non-thinker?
[03:41:22.313 --> 03:41:23.134]  You don't think critically?
[03:41:23.154 --> 03:41:24.234]  You believe everything you're told?
[03:41:24.774 --> 03:41:26.455]  You don't think there's any conspiracies out there?
[03:41:26.835 --> 03:41:30.656]  You don't think the media will, but that's the assumption is that, oh, the media will tell us.
[03:41:31.196 --> 03:41:31.456]  No!
[03:41:31.997 --> 03:41:35.818]  You learn real quick, the media is a bunch of liars when you really pay attention.
[03:41:37.901 --> 03:41:38.942]  I understand what you're saying.
[03:41:38.982 --> 03:41:42.024]  I mean, you can say a plan theorist, you can say whatever you want.
[03:41:42.044 --> 03:41:44.826]  The point is, when Jeffrey Epstein dies in a jail cell,
[03:42:03.835 --> 03:42:18.468]  And there's a camera malfunction, they took him off suicide watch, we don't have any surveillance tape, they're screaming breathe Epstein, breathe apparently, weird stuff with the photos being released, all these anomalies.
[03:42:20.791 --> 03:42:30.781]  Yeah, I think it's fair to say that there's some sort of conspiracy happening here when the media comes out and says, don't even question the narrative or you're to blame.
[03:42:30.801 --> 03:42:33.183]  And then the FBI says you're a domestic terrorist.
[03:42:33.203 --> 03:42:39.189]  So, so I mean, you can say whatever you want and yeah, people don't like the word conspiracy.
[03:42:40.311 --> 03:42:44.275]  I'm simply saying I'll own being a conspiracy theorist because
[03:42:45.632 --> 03:42:46.653]  I'm a critical thinker.
[03:42:46.954 --> 03:42:50.258]  I don't listen to mainstream news that are proven liars.
[03:42:50.798 --> 03:42:55.304]  I know that there's shadow powers that be that go unquestioned by the media.
[03:42:55.344 --> 03:43:00.330]  So, yeah, I'm a conspiracy theorist, and conspiracy theorists keep being right about this stuff.
[03:43:06.542 --> 03:43:11.984]  I'm here in my parents' kitchen because my house flooded with torrential rains this week.
[03:43:12.685 --> 03:43:15.446]  So the flooded part of the house, they're having to fix that, so I've been staying over here.
[03:43:16.727 --> 03:43:23.329]  And I looked in my parents' cupboard and found that they were stocked up on some of the InfoWars Life products.
[03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:24.170]  And I thought, wait a minute.
[03:43:24.790 --> 03:43:30.814]  I've been thinking about coming over to their house because their kitchen is nicer than mine and shooting a video about how amazing these products are.
[03:43:31.294 --> 03:43:34.416]  So I called Drew, one of our great camera people over at M4's this morning.
[03:43:35.016 --> 03:43:40.219]  I said, hey, why don't you meet me over here and I'm going to shoot a video I've been meaning to do for probably a year.
[03:43:40.299 --> 03:43:41.520]  So I'm like, I've got everything right here.
[03:43:42.807 --> 03:43:44.348]  It's time to show you what I personally do.
[03:43:44.828 --> 03:43:45.928]  Now, I want to be clear.
[03:43:46.809 --> 03:43:56.113]  When I remember to take the supplements religiously, I lose weight, I'm healthy, my skin gets great, I have better stamina, libido, energy.
[03:43:56.774 --> 03:43:57.814]  I've never been a supplements guy.
[03:43:57.834 --> 03:44:02.116]  A lot of my big sponsors were supplement people, and I thought, well, why don't I try these then?
[03:44:02.456 --> 03:44:03.497]  And it turned out they were really good.
[03:44:04.137 --> 03:44:07.038]  So we came out, as you know, six years ago with our own line of supplements.
[03:44:07.058 --> 03:44:08.399]  We've been expanding it ever since.
[03:44:08.419 --> 03:44:09.820]  And what we do is,
[03:44:10.720 --> 03:44:17.448]  Set out to already find what's the highest rated, already find what's the cleanest, what's the best, and then make it better, and then cut the price.
[03:44:18.048 --> 03:44:19.610]  And that's what we've done with these products.
[03:44:19.870 --> 03:44:29.821]  And that's why InfoWars Live products are so highly rated by third-party sites, that's why they're so popular with you, and it's also great because it funds our political operations, trying to stop the technotronic, technocracy takeover.
[03:44:32.615 --> 03:44:35.918]  I always start taking the supplements and then I forget to take them.
[03:44:35.938 --> 03:44:41.684]  I either run out or I just get busy and then all of a sudden I'm not taking DNA Force.
[03:44:42.144 --> 03:44:43.846]  All of a sudden, I'm not taking X2.
[03:44:43.886 --> 03:44:45.547]  I'm not taking Secret 12.
[03:44:46.188 --> 03:44:58.059]  That's why it's important for everybody out there that already knows they got great results with these high quality products at 4-H Life or other supplements you've been taking to remember how good they were for you and your family and to get back into it.
[03:44:58.599 --> 03:45:05.987]  So today I just wanted to encourage everybody that's gotten great results with these products to just remember that because I need that reminder as well.
[03:45:06.527 --> 03:45:12.773]  One of the biggest things is I tend to go to the warehouse and get some of the products out for myself and then those run out and I forget.
[03:45:13.354 --> 03:45:16.297]  So now what I do, what my parents do, and
[03:45:16.577 --> 03:45:31.167]  Other people I know is they just put it on auto ship and then fullwarslive.com get an additional 10% off and then you don't forget each month or every two months how much you want to have it shipped to you to get the product, support the show, and of course also get 10% off.
[03:45:31.708 --> 03:45:38.412]  Now some of the things I do is I don't really like soft drinks because they got so much sugar in them and I already have a problem with sweets sometimes.
[03:45:39.193 --> 03:45:41.635]  So I really like soft drinks what I'm proud to say is.
[03:45:42.475 --> 03:45:43.737]  I don't like the effects they have on me.
[03:45:44.338 --> 03:45:50.846]  So what I do is take something like a Perrier, lime or non-flavored, and I put it into a nice glass.
[03:45:52.749 --> 03:45:55.933]  And then I take the Ultra 12
[03:45:58.186 --> 03:46:02.930]  And put in a whole dropper, and then I stir it up, and the flavor is incredible.
[03:46:03.430 --> 03:46:18.341]  So again, take your favorite sparkling water that doesn't have any calories in it, either flavored or unflavored, it all goes great with the flavor of natural vitamin B12 that has a sweet taste without any sugar or additives.
[03:46:18.361 --> 03:46:24.285]  You've got to experience Ultra 12 for yourself, you've got to experience X2 as well, and of course, X3.
[03:46:24.385 --> 03:46:26.107]  That's triiodine.
[03:46:26.807 --> 03:46:28.108]  Different strokes for different folks.
[03:46:28.528 --> 03:46:33.712]  Bottom line, these are all incredible products that have changed my life and changed so many other people's lives.
[03:46:34.132 --> 03:46:41.997]  As I've said over and over again, it then funds an organization dedicated to exposing the globalists and their operations.
[03:46:42.037 --> 03:46:43.478]  That's why I thank you all for your support.
[03:46:43.498 --> 03:46:46.240]  I want to encourage you, if you haven't tried these products, to try them.
[03:46:46.640 --> 03:46:48.242]  And if you have tried them and, again, forgot,
[03:46:49.002 --> 03:46:50.724]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:31.434 --> 03:47:34.256]  Alright, final segment of the Alex Jones Show here today.
[03:47:37.338 --> 03:47:45.584]  And it could be the final day, it's supposed to be the final day, of the Banniversary Sales at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:47:46.325 --> 03:47:53.109]  That's right, this week was the one year Banniversary since Alex Jones got shut down off all social media, all the InfoWars live broadcasts shut down.
[03:47:54.951 --> 03:47:56.552]  So we had the Banniversary Sale
[03:47:57.964 --> 03:48:15.138]  Which includes up to 60% off some supplements at InfoWareStore.com, double Patriot points with every order that can be applied towards future purchases, and free shipping, free shipping store-wide.
[03:48:15.218 --> 03:48:15.879]  Free shipping, huh?
[03:48:16.139 --> 03:48:17.000]  Yeah, free shipping.
[03:48:17.140 --> 03:48:18.861]  And when you order emergency food,

[03:49:02.136 --> 03:49:02.576]  Okay!
[03:49:04.618 --> 03:49:05.999]  Back out to the phone lines.
[03:49:06.159 --> 03:49:08.080]  Let's go to Roger in Florida.
[03:49:08.160 --> 03:49:08.981]  Go ahead, Roger.
[03:49:10.745 --> 03:49:11.105]  Hey, Owen.
[03:49:11.125 --> 03:49:11.706]  How are you, buddy?
[03:49:12.226 --> 03:49:12.386]  Good.
[03:49:12.426 --> 03:49:12.906]  Thanks for calling.
[03:49:13.967 --> 03:49:14.327]  Hey, man.
[03:49:14.347 --> 03:49:19.070]  First, I want to say thank you for your guys' continued efforts in shining light into dark places.
[03:49:19.630 --> 03:49:23.713]  You guys are really doing a great job there and continue to fight for all these patriots out there.
[03:49:25.053 --> 03:49:28.175]  You know, we can beat this Epstein course to death.
[03:49:28.195 --> 03:49:32.118]  We all know that 1 plus 1, the media is trying to make it equal 3, but it's not adding up.
[03:49:33.444 --> 03:49:37.366]  You know, let's take it all the way back to 2008, things that are not being exposed.
[03:49:37.846 --> 03:49:45.611]  When he was first brought into the court system in Palm Beach, and his initial deal was struck for child trafficking and pedophilia.
[03:49:45.751 --> 03:49:54.436]  And then the deal was struck with the sheriff who recommended and oversaw his work release, and I'm using air quotes, program, where he was allowed to continue his behavior.
[03:49:55.076 --> 03:50:00.159]  And so when that was briefly exposed in the media down here, the sheriff himself,
[03:50:00.987 --> 03:50:05.749]  You know, thought about doing his own internal investigation, didn't want any outside resources.
[03:50:05.829 --> 03:50:09.070]  And, you know, since then, all that's been swept under the rug, man.
[03:50:09.130 --> 03:50:17.152]  But, you know, let's go back to the roots of the problem and what, if any, Alex always says to follow the money.
[03:50:17.352 --> 03:50:24.895]  I was wondering, you know, did Epstein or somebody close to him make a reelection donation to him for his sweet deal down here?
[03:50:24.915 --> 03:50:25.895]  What do you think?
[03:50:28.632 --> 03:50:30.734]  I'm not sure I really follow that trail.
[03:50:30.754 --> 03:50:35.217]  I mean, you know, Epstein had money tied up in a lot of different places.
[03:50:35.237 --> 03:50:44.544]  I mean, if you just look at the political people involved with him, I mean, it goes both ways, mostly towards the Democrat aisle.
[03:50:45.685 --> 03:50:47.226]  Here's the money I'm following right now.
[03:50:48.888 --> 03:50:51.930]  I mean, if Epstein really died in that jail,
[03:50:54.278 --> 03:50:55.719]  Somebody paid off security.
[03:50:55.759 --> 03:50:57.380]  Somebody paid off technicians.
[03:50:57.420 --> 03:50:58.560]  Somebody paid off somebody.
[03:50:59.060 --> 03:50:59.901]  People got paid off.
[03:51:01.241 --> 03:51:02.342]  I'd be following that money.
[03:51:02.942 --> 03:51:06.464]  As far as Epstein's money is concerned, they should already be doing that investigation.
[03:51:06.484 --> 03:51:10.666]  I mean, I'm sure that can go dozens of different ways.
[03:51:10.686 --> 03:51:15.088]  So I'm not sure if you need to necessarily follow one trail or a recent trail.
[03:51:15.188 --> 03:51:20.291]  I think that the whole just body of work is going to be enough
[03:51:21.311 --> 03:51:26.134]  And again, I mean, we're talking about blackmail here more than anything, really.
[03:51:26.154 --> 03:51:33.038]  And I think that that's kind of the factor, really, that probably can never even go public.
[03:51:33.418 --> 03:51:42.103]  I mean, they found a, what was it, they found a file in Epstein's safe that was like, underage nudes or something like that?
[03:51:42.203 --> 03:51:49.327]  I can't remember what it was, but man, I mean, it's just, here's the headline, yeah, Rudy Giuliani is calling it out.
[03:51:50.247 --> 03:51:53.008]  You know, maybe that's why Rudy Giuliani's been acting so odd lately.
[03:51:53.028 --> 03:51:56.449]  It's just because he knows everything's about to come out, so he's just kind of like, man, whatever.
[03:51:57.710 --> 03:51:58.330]  But it's crazy.
[03:51:58.350 --> 03:51:59.170]  Thanks for the call, Roger.
[03:51:59.210 --> 03:52:02.011]  Let's go to Jessica in Florida.
[03:52:02.051 --> 03:52:02.751]  Go ahead, Jessica.
[03:52:02.771 --> 03:52:05.012]  Hey, Owen.
[03:52:05.032 --> 03:52:05.472]  How's it going?
[03:52:05.772 --> 03:52:05.952]  Good.
[03:52:05.992 --> 03:52:06.513]  Thanks for calling.
[03:52:07.733 --> 03:52:07.973]  Good.
[03:52:08.013 --> 03:52:19.197]  So, yeah, on the Epstein topic, you know, I was saying, I think it's pretty odd that the comparison between, you know, they just went out there and they rated that island
[03:52:19.756 --> 03:52:19.896]  Okay.
[03:52:30.746 --> 03:52:37.211]  Immediate pictures of this supposed guy dead on a gurney and New York Post and NBC are the first to be reporting this.
[03:52:37.571 --> 03:52:46.277]  By the way, that photo is like people that are very familiar with prison and all this stuff and everything that goes on.
[03:52:46.317 --> 03:52:47.138]  I was looking at this.
[03:52:48.058 --> 03:52:51.161]  All agree that photo was very strange.
[03:52:51.481 --> 03:52:55.804]  For them to release that photo, for them to even have that photo, but like from the weird angle.
[03:52:56.444 --> 03:52:57.765]  So there's all kinds of weirdness here.
[03:52:58.946 --> 03:53:05.291]  I just have more questions than answers, but based on what we know, we're being lied to!
[03:53:05.311 --> 03:53:06.471]  I mean, we're being lied to!
[03:53:06.491 --> 03:53:08.253]  The guy did not commit suicide!
[03:53:08.313 --> 03:53:09.814]  I mean, this is, it's impossible!
[03:53:09.834 --> 03:53:13.977]  It's either assisted murder, or a complete lie.
[03:53:14.017 --> 03:53:14.217]  What?
[03:53:14.277 --> 03:53:15.478]  Witness protection?
[03:53:15.578 --> 03:53:17.439]  It's an assisted murder, or he's not dead.
[03:53:17.459 --> 03:53:18.960]  I mean, the other.
[03:53:20.701 --> 03:53:23.323]  Yeah, and it's, there's obviously an inside job happening here.
[03:53:23.624 --> 03:53:24.644]  It could go either way.
[03:53:24.664 --> 03:53:27.526]  Uh, thanks for the call, Jessica.
[03:53:27.586 --> 03:53:27.887]  Let's take
[03:53:29.363 --> 03:53:31.784]  You know, Cindy, who also had that Roger Stone point.
[03:53:32.084 --> 03:53:33.365]  Cindy in California, go ahead.
[03:53:34.145 --> 03:53:35.485]  I think it's Sydney, actually.
[03:53:35.886 --> 03:53:36.266]  Sydney?
[03:53:36.386 --> 03:53:37.426]  Okay, sorry, go ahead.
[03:53:37.566 --> 03:53:39.427]  I can talk like a Cindy, but I'm Sydney.
[03:53:39.447 --> 03:53:41.588]  Well, I don't know, maybe you identify as a woman.
[03:53:42.228 --> 03:53:44.469]  Either way, I'm in California, what do you want?
[03:53:45.109 --> 03:53:52.772]  So anyways, let me just say, I've been tracking on Alex Jones since the 60s, because I've been researching the Kennedy assassinations and all that stuff.
[03:53:53.351 --> 03:53:56.373]  And he and I have held hands all the way along and here we are.
[03:53:56.973 --> 03:54:08.379]  And one of the things that you begin to recognize in terms of trying to track down what is referred to as a conspiracy, is that when the oddities just mount up, it's not a red flag, it's a flare.
[03:54:09.179 --> 03:54:16.022]  And this is probably one of the most significant things that's happened in terms of trying to unveil this global conspiracy.
[03:54:16.743 --> 03:54:21.265]  So the thing that really bothers me, that's really bothered me a lot, is that
[03:54:22.657 --> 03:54:24.698]  Actually, the previous caller kind of referenced that.
[03:54:25.358 --> 03:54:33.021]  Here we have Petto Island, which is a storehouse of who knows what, and it took two weeks for the FBI to go there?
[03:54:34.242 --> 03:54:35.922]  That doesn't make any sense to me.
[03:54:35.982 --> 03:54:39.324]  As she mentioned, Roger Stone, he winked the wrong way.
[03:54:39.744 --> 03:54:46.547]  And the next thing you know, they're, you know, stealing all of his stuff and taking his stuff, and he can't talk and whatever else.
[03:54:46.927 --> 03:54:49.988]  But here's one of the biggest criminals in the history of the world,
[03:54:50.501 --> 03:54:55.765]  And somehow the FBI does not go out to Petal Island and secure that evidence immediately?
[03:54:56.465 --> 03:55:01.169]  And as it's coming out, things have already been removed.
[03:55:01.349 --> 03:55:04.251]  And like, who did that?
[03:55:04.291 --> 03:55:20.062]  The real question for me is, how is it that there was some sort of, it almost feels like a secret stand-down order by the FBI, because that's their prerogative, to go out there and seal that location immediately?
[03:55:20.518 --> 03:55:22.400]  I mean, that makes no sense to me.
[03:55:22.700 --> 03:55:30.508]  And that again just adds to another level of what... You know, that is actually an interesting point we haven't really delved into here.
[03:55:30.528 --> 03:55:42.180]  Yeah, and let's not forget, Jeffrey Epstein was an FBI informant, and there's... I mean, this is really... I mean, very few people can even operate in this pay grade, but like...
[03:55:43.814 --> 03:55:44.554]  I mean, think about that.
[03:55:44.794 --> 03:55:48.936]  If Eftin is an FBI informant, are there still FBI agents there that he was working with?
[03:55:48.996 --> 03:55:51.456]  Are there still FBI agents there that are trying to cover this up?
[03:55:51.516 --> 03:55:55.158]  Are there still FBI agents on the inside that are trying to keep this under wraps?
[03:55:55.538 --> 03:55:57.979]  And I think the logical answer would be yeah!
[03:56:01.540 --> 03:56:06.961]  There is quite a powerful cotillion of whoever they are, okay?
[03:56:07.422 --> 03:56:11.683]  But why the FBI did some sort of secret stand down, where did that come from?
[03:56:12.170 --> 03:56:19.591]  Why was there not someone in the FBI, and everybody has the same feeling, get out there and seize whatever is there.
[03:56:19.631 --> 03:56:20.511]  That's what you do.
[03:56:21.192 --> 03:56:22.892]  That's just what you do, you know?
[03:56:23.412 --> 03:56:27.173]  And the fact that that didn't happen raises huge questions for me.
[03:56:27.793 --> 03:56:35.774]  But think about this, because we're all operating in this small space of time of the last couple days of Epstein's death.
[03:56:36.354 --> 03:56:40.275]  This guy had been a known trafficker for decades!
[03:56:41.434 --> 03:56:42.214]  Decades!
[03:56:42.255 --> 03:56:44.656]  The FBI already has access to most of these files.
[03:56:44.916 --> 03:56:45.797]  Let's not forget about that!
[03:56:46.977 --> 03:56:49.799]  They have known about Jeffrey Epstein and Pedophile Island for decades.
[03:56:49.839 --> 03:56:51.340]  They could have raided this island years ago.
[03:56:51.420 --> 03:56:52.801]  People have been calling it for years.
[03:56:53.141 --> 03:57:05.208]  For this... So, so... I mean, you feel like it's too little too late at this point, but... Again, I mean, we've got media trying to cover this up, FBI trying to cover this up, people inside the jail system trying to cover this up.
[03:57:05.248 --> 03:57:08.130]  I mean... Are we... Do you think we're ever going to get any answers?
[03:57:09.771 --> 03:57:09.811]  Uh...
[03:57:11.130 --> 03:57:12.351]  Yeah, we better.
[03:57:12.891 --> 03:57:13.792]  That's all I can say.
[03:57:14.152 --> 03:57:14.813]  We'd better.
[03:57:14.833 --> 03:57:16.034]  I have a feeling we're not.
[03:57:16.474 --> 03:57:19.816]  Well, I tend to agree with you because... And I'll be honest with you, Sidney.
[03:57:19.836 --> 03:57:20.617]  Thank you for the call.
[03:57:22.558 --> 03:57:24.199]  I don't even care if we don't get any answers.
[03:57:24.840 --> 03:57:25.961]  You don't have to give me any answers.
[03:57:26.832 --> 03:57:28.133]  Arrest all the damn pedophiles.
[03:57:28.794 --> 03:57:29.855]  Hang them from the highest tree.
[03:57:30.516 --> 03:57:31.336]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:57:31.577 --> 03:57:32.417]  I'm not allowed to say that.
[03:57:32.457 --> 03:57:32.818]  Didn't you hear?
[03:57:33.078 --> 03:57:37.602]  Rod Rosenstein and Rosie O'Donnell feel bad for Jeffrey Epstein because he's a pedophile.
[03:57:37.842 --> 03:57:39.044]  Literally, they did that on Twitter.
[03:57:39.084 --> 03:57:42.567]  So I'm probably bad because I want to see pedophiles hung from a tree.
[03:57:42.947 --> 03:57:49.594]  I'm probably bad because I want to see pedophiles receive a worthy punishment.
[03:57:49.614 --> 03:57:50.915]  I'm probably bad for that, huh?
[03:57:54.879 --> 03:57:58.899]  When you finance what we're doing, you're not just funding the Second American Revolution.
[03:58:00.290 --> 03:58:01.851]  You're changing world destiny.
[03:58:02.191 --> 03:58:06.374]  And there's so much fake stuff out there in a million different voices, and I understand that.
[03:58:06.655 --> 03:58:11.958]  But we really are in the zeitgeist, and we try to make it easy to get good products at the same time.
[03:58:12.038 --> 03:58:18.403]  But I can just tell you point blank, you cannot invest in a place better than InfoWars for human liberty and a pro-human future.
[03:58:18.463 --> 03:58:24.207]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[03:58:24.247 --> 03:58:26.689]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[03:58:26.889 --> 03:58:29.391]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[03:58:29.411 --> 03:58:32.333]  We have fish oil, children's fish oil, and ultimate krill oil.
[03:58:32.493 --> 03:58:33.634]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[03:58:33.994 --> 03:58:36.937]  And it is the strongest, purest fish oil, krill oil.
[03:58:36.997 --> 03:58:43.582]  And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[03:58:43.782 --> 03:58:49.486]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[03:58:49.526 --> 03:58:51.908]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[03:58:52.048 --> 03:58:52.789]  This is not real.
[03:58:53.089 --> 03:58:54.530]  We went to one of the top firms in the
[03:58:54.770 --> 03:58:55.293]  We're good.
