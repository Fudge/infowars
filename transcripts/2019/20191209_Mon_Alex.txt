[00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:05.951]  Mark your calendars, my fellow Americans, my fellow humans across the planet.
[00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:18.315]  Monday, December 9th, 2019, the day the sleeping giant that is free humanity began to really awaken and take action.
[00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:22.457]  Something very, very magic happened this morning.
[00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:33.376]  As Owen Schroyer just spontaneously decided to confront Nadler, right as he began his opening statement, I literally had a shot of energy go through me.
[00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:38.661]  And I ran up to my wife and I said, the answer is hitting the streets.
[00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:40.944]  The answer is protesting in Congress.
[00:00:40.964 --> 00:00:43.006]  The answer is the silent majority rising up.
[00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:46.108]  Sure, that's a common sense answer, but I felt the energy.
[00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.230]  Five minutes later, the phone started ringing.
[00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:50.393]  Owen has just taken over the hearings.
[00:00:51.328 --> 00:00:54.410]  This is amazing what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.052]  So let's go to some of what unfolded, the IG report coming out, and so much more.
[00:01:00.013 --> 00:01:02.094]  Here is how the committee will proceed for this hearing.
[00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:07.537]  I will make an opening statement, and then I will recognize the ranking member for an opening statement.
[00:01:08.317 --> 00:01:10.758]  After that, we will hear two sets of presentations.
[00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.544]  We will hear 30-minute opening arguments from counsels for the majority and the minority of this committee.
[00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:30.173]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country!
[00:01:30.493 --> 00:01:33.514]  And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes!
[00:01:33.554 --> 00:01:34.755]  You are, Jerry Nadler!
[00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.515]  You're the one committing treason!
[00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:38.016]  America's done with this!
[00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:41.437]  America's sick of the treason committed by the Democrat Party!
[00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.173]  We're not going to sit here and watch you run an impeachment campaign and remove our vote!
[00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:52.038]  We voted for Donald Trump, and they're simply removing him because they don't like him!
[00:01:52.058 --> 00:01:55.001]  Americans are sick of your impeachment scam!
[00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:57.162]  They're sick of the Democrat treason!
[00:01:57.182 --> 00:02:03.588]  We know who committed the crimes, and it wasn't Trump!
[00:02:03.608 --> 00:02:04.929]  Trump is innocent!
[00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:06.230]  The committee will come to order.
[00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:21.280]  Obviously, I shouldn't have to remind everyone present that the audience is here to observe, but not to demonstrate, not to indicate agreement or disagreement with any witness or with any member of the committee.
[00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:24.642]  Yeah, I'm Owen Schroeder from InfoWars.com.
[00:02:24.862 --> 00:02:25.842]  InfoWars.com?
[00:02:25.882 --> 00:02:26.162]  Yeah.
[00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:26.702]  What's your name?
[00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:27.763]  Owen Schroeder.
[00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:32.885]  I think it's ironic I'm being hauled out of here when the Democrats are the ones committing crimes.
[00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:39.389]  I'm being arrested right now for disruption of Congress.
[00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.773]  I'm a criminal for my first amendment rights.
[00:02:42.014 --> 00:02:42.835]  See you right here, folks.
[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:22.052]  We're here at the Central Texas News Center in Austin, Texas, where, with your help, we have helped reignite the awakening of the American Republic against the globalist threat.
[00:03:22.192 --> 00:03:26.718]  But that just started the war with the Deep State, the CHICOMs, and others out in the open.
[00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.019]  So now, there's 330 days.
[00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:38.142]  We're working seven days a week ahead of this critical election to try to keep our populist president, who's under incredible attack, Donald John Trump, in the White House.
[00:03:38.622 --> 00:03:43.503]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be out in the streets, peacefully bringing information to the American people.
[00:03:43.743 --> 00:03:45.964]  But the antifa terrorists have gotten very, very violent.
[00:03:46.244 --> 00:03:50.265]  And so, we've had to up our game in the face of the global scourge.
[00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:57.730]  We're going to have our crew across the United States in this baby, going into areas these terrorists would deny us.
[00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:11.939]  This is the end of the war, and this is our commitment to you to fight harder than we ever have, to get the word out and not submit to these tyrants and their tycoon backers that would silence the American people.
[00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.401]  Because America is rising in 2020!
[00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:15.761]  Be part of it!
[00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.002]  Take action now!
[00:04:20.871 --> 00:04:36.306]  Ladies and gentlemen, if we want to turn this world and turn this planet around, all we have to do is have our voices heard and stop complying with the corrupt forces that are on our planet and promoting the good forces.
[00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:39.429]  You are those good forces.
[00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.594]  You are the light in the dark of the night, and you belong.
[00:04:46.016 --> 00:04:46.737]  In the Capitol.
[00:04:47.457 --> 00:04:48.318]  In the state houses.
[00:04:48.858 --> 00:04:49.779]  In the legislatures.
[00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:51.460]  In the county commissioners.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.981]  In the city councils.
[00:04:53.601 --> 00:04:55.163]  You belong in the neighborhood commissions.
[00:04:55.823 --> 00:04:57.524]  You belong in the churches.
[00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:07.191]  You belong, instead of hiding out in our homes, watching the NFL mesmerize in a trance while the globalists steal our future.
[00:05:08.152 --> 00:05:09.973]  It is Monday, December 9th, 2019, and this morning,
[00:05:14.102 --> 00:05:22.804]  I was getting dressed, getting ready to come into the office and I just was energized as I was starting to walk out of the bedroom and walk out the front door.
[00:05:22.824 --> 00:05:26.145]  And my wife said, man, you look wound up.
[00:05:26.205 --> 00:05:29.686]  You look like you're been electrocuted or something.
[00:05:29.706 --> 00:05:30.946]  You're just like shining.
[00:05:31.526 --> 00:05:32.907]  She said, wow, what's going on?
[00:05:32.927 --> 00:05:36.247]  And started trying to drag me back in the bedroom.
[00:05:36.968 --> 00:05:37.928]  And that's true story.
[00:05:38.068 --> 00:05:38.568]  And I said,
[00:05:39.704 --> 00:05:40.685]  We're going to take action.
[00:05:40.985 --> 00:05:42.227]  We're going to confront the globalists.
[00:05:42.487 --> 00:05:44.930]  We're going to call for people to march on D.C.
[00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.831]  peacefully now.
[00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:47.813]  Now is the time for the march on D.C.
[00:05:47.873 --> 00:05:49.475]  And we're going to go into the Capitol.
[00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:50.876]  And we're going to go into the meeting rooms.
[00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:55.161]  And we're going to let these traitors and criminals know that they're not going to impeach our president for thought crime.
[00:05:56.578 --> 00:05:58.499]  And we're going to do it in the streets.
[00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.360]  We're going to do it in front of the state capitals.
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.901]  We're going to do it everywhere, whether you're one person or a hundred.
[00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:07.923]  And more and more and more are going to come out, just like the movie Network, saying, I'm mad as hell.
[00:06:07.963 --> 00:06:09.023]  I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:10.664]  You're not going to impeach our president.
[00:06:11.886 --> 00:06:15.367]  Because there's reports out they've got senators ready to flip on the president.
[00:06:15.627 --> 00:06:17.648]  They've got all these excuses for them to turn against him.
[00:06:17.668 --> 00:06:20.089]  And there's a very good chance they could remove him.
[00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:21.769]  They've got a lot of tricks up their sleeves.
[00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:25.871]  But not if we are confronting individuals in swing states with the truth.
[00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:27.431]  Not if we are active.
[00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:28.412]  Not if we're in the streets.
[00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:30.933]  If they see us in the streets of D.C.
[00:06:32.853 --> 00:06:34.154]  Everybody's got to get on a plane.
[00:06:34.434 --> 00:06:35.354]  I'm going to do it as well.
[00:06:35.734 --> 00:06:36.875]  And you've got to go to D.C.
[00:06:36.915 --> 00:06:37.595]  So it hit me.
[00:06:39.022 --> 00:06:41.884]  And I even said to my wife, we need people to hit the streets.
[00:06:41.904 --> 00:06:43.005]  We need our voices to be heard.
[00:06:43.045 --> 00:06:44.767]  We need the sleeping giant to rise up.
[00:06:44.807 --> 00:06:46.188]  And she goes, yeah, that's common sense.
[00:06:46.888 --> 00:06:53.013]  That's why this tyranny is happening, is because we don't follow natural law, and we don't stand up for ourselves.
[00:06:53.714 --> 00:07:08.366]  And then, I was getting a coffee to go, loading up my water bottle, five minutes later, and buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz, Buzz, BuzzFeed, Washington Times, Associated Press, they're like,
[00:07:10.285 --> 00:07:11.686]  Did you tell Owen to do this?
[00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:15.930]  That's how they try to trick you all to see if it was some directive I gave.
[00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.952]  And I started saying, do what?
[00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:26.741]  They started sending me screenshots and images of Owen standing up to Nadler and pointing out that he's guilty.
[00:07:27.742 --> 00:07:28.002]  I don't know.
[00:07:57.824 --> 00:08:10.738]  Whether it's a bumper sticker on your car, or whether it is calling into a talk show, or whether it is posting online or sharing an article or video, or going to Congress.
[00:08:10.778 --> 00:08:11.799]  These are the people's house.
[00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:15.963]  The seats weren't even full when Owen got in.
[00:08:16.323 --> 00:08:19.587]  And this is why when the media started calling me, they said, oh, did you direct this?
[00:08:20.027 --> 00:08:20.448]  And I didn't.
[00:08:21.772 --> 00:08:23.053]  I told you we were going to be in D.C.
[00:08:23.713 --> 00:08:29.417]  Whenever I go into these events, I don't disrupt them because I'm already being attacked at these hearings in many cases.
[00:08:30.197 --> 00:08:31.138]  The hearings we show up for.
[00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:39.083]  And I'm already not allowed to face my accusers, so I like to sit there and it points out in the media that I'm being attacked but I can't speak.
[00:08:40.304 --> 00:08:43.706]  And I specifically told Owen, don't get arrested when you're in D.C.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.983]  And also at the Hershey Pennsylvania event tomorrow night.
[00:08:48.684 --> 00:08:53.609]  Owen did this as a citizen and I'm proud of him and now is the time for civil disobedience.
[00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:56.573]  But they did what I thought they'd do.
[00:08:56.633 --> 00:09:04.962]  They barred our camera person as if he'd done something wrong when he didn't even know it was going to happen until Owen did it.
[00:09:07.199 --> 00:09:13.964]  They came in, they sat down, Nat was started talking, and Owen couldn't control himself, and I probably couldn't have at that point either.
[00:09:13.984 --> 00:09:15.325]  You can see Owen coming in right there.
[00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:16.706]  It's on C-SPAN.
[00:09:16.746 --> 00:09:17.667]  He is hot.
[00:09:18.668 --> 00:09:19.368]  He is sick of it.
[00:09:20.869 --> 00:09:28.715]  Owen did that as a citizen, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm proud of him.
[00:09:30.376 --> 00:09:33.639]  But they can't stop you, ladies and gentlemen, from having your voice heard, however you're going to do it.
[00:09:34.315 --> 00:09:38.696]  And the left piled on and said, how dare him do that?
[00:09:38.736 --> 00:09:39.956]  Or others say, oh, you're pathetic.
[00:09:40.016 --> 00:09:41.476]  You know, you're not going to have any effect.
[00:09:41.736 --> 00:09:42.877]  Those would make you feel small.
[00:09:42.937 --> 00:09:44.837]  It's all military propaganda.
[00:09:44.877 --> 00:09:45.877]  Lay down, G.I.
[00:09:46.157 --> 00:09:47.838]  Tokyo Rose, you're going down.
[00:09:48.178 --> 00:09:48.978]  We're going to defeat you.
[00:09:50.178 --> 00:09:52.299]  But the truth is, these criminals have overplayed their hand.
[00:09:52.319 --> 00:09:53.099]  They're going down.
[00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:57.300]  Unless we don't stand up to them, they could push.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.201]  And daring greatly, fortune favors the bold, they could snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
[00:10:04.416 --> 00:10:07.310]  Just before we went live, minutes ago, we got the call.
[00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.435]  Owen just got out of jail.
[00:10:10.185 --> 00:10:15.248]  He is driving back to the Capitol so that we can do a live feed with him from outside.
[00:10:15.288 --> 00:10:19.129]  He should be with us in about 15 minutes or so live on air.
[00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:20.750]  And he did get arrested.
[00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.111]  They were saying they were going to charge him with disrupting Congress.
[00:10:23.532 --> 00:10:27.333]  Most of the time when leftists fall down and yell and scream, they don't get charged.
[00:10:27.353 --> 00:10:34.257]  But we'll see what happens because the crime of being an American standing up to treason is the highest crime to the globalists.
[00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:40.517]  So that's all coming up, but I'm telling you, now is the time if you were ever going to go to D.C.
[00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:45.462]  Now is the time if you were ever going to travel to Congress.
[00:10:45.662 --> 00:10:47.744]  They're open public houses to the people.
[00:10:48.605 --> 00:10:53.470]  Everyone's so intimidated to be near this that Owen had to wait in line about 10 minutes.
[00:10:55.152 --> 00:10:57.134]  And they walked in, there were still seats available.
[00:10:57.214 --> 00:10:58.576]  Not many, but still seats available.
[00:10:59.636 --> 00:11:02.538]  Because everyone's so intimidated of the people's house.
[00:11:02.598 --> 00:11:03.578]  They're not royalty.
[00:11:03.638 --> 00:11:04.719]  It's not Windsor Palace.
[00:11:05.439 --> 00:11:06.200]  It's our house.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:06.880]  We built it.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.421]  It's ours.
[00:11:09.142 --> 00:11:10.823]  Everybody else was in there videotaping.
[00:11:11.243 --> 00:11:15.145]  One of the top trending things on Twitter is this video, and the truth's getting out.
[00:11:15.565 --> 00:11:24.631]  And again, if you decide this is the trigger, like in V for Vendetta, at the end of the movie when the people cross the line and the soldiers stand down, if you decide
[00:11:26.243 --> 00:11:28.024]  Then we can en masse go to D.C.
[00:11:28.044 --> 00:11:29.865]  and let these criminals know we're not putting up with it.
[00:11:31.406 --> 00:11:47.397]  When the President tweets, when lying individuals like Fiona Hill are saying, I don't know Jordan Soros, I'm not a globalist, when she runs his major foundation and writes for theglobalist.com, they say that when he tweets and says I'm innocent, they say that's intimidating witnesses.
[00:11:47.697 --> 00:11:49.198]  They say your speech is illegal.
[00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:50.659]  They say the President's speech is illegal.
[00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.500]  And he's surrounded by traitors and cowards.
[00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:54.982]  He's isolated, sinking into the swamp.
[00:11:56.974 --> 00:12:00.936]  We're not, and if we stand here like a bunch of damn spectators, we get what we deserve.
[00:12:00.996 --> 00:12:15.244]  So, I was downtown at the Capitol last night from 7 to 9 at night, talking to people and bullhorning and speaking out about the war on Christmas and the war on Christianity and the Islamic attack on Christmas events all over the world.
[00:12:16.344 --> 00:12:18.906]  From Asia to Europe to Canada to the U.S.
[00:12:20.169 --> 00:12:24.415]  And I'm just going to start hitting the streets every day for the next 329 days.
[00:12:24.816 --> 00:12:27.279]  You have my confirmed confirmation.
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.304]  I'm going to be in public places for the next 329 days.
[00:12:30.324 --> 00:12:30.544]  Every day.
[00:12:33.595 --> 00:12:44.679]  If I'm physically able to, not just on air, not just doing more live shows, and I told you last Friday with that video we aired earlier, the armored vehicle rolling out of our garage to go meet our crew in D.C.
[00:12:44.739 --> 00:12:45.679]  It's all there right now.
[00:12:45.719 --> 00:12:56.763]  We've got lots of peaceful resistance to tyranny planned, and that armored vehicle, I'm so glad we were renting it at first that we got it, because it just tugs over the news media and our topics.
[00:12:57.782 --> 00:13:00.164]  Coming to the mainstream every time with that.
[00:13:00.224 --> 00:13:01.065]  So it's another blessing.
[00:13:01.105 --> 00:13:03.447]  Thanks to all you supporting us and keeping us in the game.
[00:13:03.587 --> 00:13:05.068]  So much taking place.
[00:13:05.128 --> 00:13:07.650]  The Inspector General report set to drop any minute now.
[00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:08.791]  We'll cover it all now.
[00:13:25.319 --> 00:13:30.261]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country!
[00:13:30.521 --> 00:13:33.542]  And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes!
[00:13:33.582 --> 00:13:34.803]  You are, Jerry Nadler!
[00:13:35.143 --> 00:13:36.524]  You're the one committing treason!
[00:13:36.864 --> 00:13:38.064]  America's done with this!
[00:13:38.665 --> 00:13:41.466]  America's sick of the treason committed by the Democrat Party!
[00:13:42.225 --> 00:13:45.869]  We're not going to continue to watch you run an impeachment campaign and remove our vote!
[00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:51.075]  We voted for Donald Trump, and they're simply removing him because they don't like him!
[00:13:51.095 --> 00:13:52.977]  Americans are sick of your impeachment scam!
[00:13:53.317 --> 00:13:55.039]  They're sick of the Democrat treason!
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.802]  We know you committed the crimes, and it wasn't Trump!
[00:13:58.062 --> 00:13:59.063]  Trump is innocent!
[00:14:15.822 --> 00:14:18.565]  Owen Schroyer is at the Capitol right now.
[00:14:18.605 --> 00:14:20.427]  They're getting the camera equipment set up.
[00:14:20.447 --> 00:14:21.408]  He just got out of jail.
[00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:23.690]  You can see him on C-SPAN.
[00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:25.192]  They walk in.
[00:14:27.894 --> 00:14:28.875]  They sit down a few minutes.
[00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:30.077]  Nadler starts talking.
[00:14:32.419 --> 00:14:33.881]  And Owen just says, this is treason.
[00:14:34.982 --> 00:14:38.625]  You're the ones that are engaged in impeachable offenses, and that's even when...
[00:14:39.465 --> 00:14:42.987]  Respected liberal law professor Jonathan Turley said it's cut and dry.
[00:14:43.607 --> 00:14:56.313]  They're saying that even if the president didn't do quid pro quo, even if he didn't do anything wrong, it's if they think his intent was something, a thought crime, that he's going to be removed.
[00:15:00.148 --> 00:15:01.228]  Mike Adams said it right.
[00:15:01.328 --> 00:15:03.889]  Democrats are summoning the demon of political violence.
[00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:07.329]  Next phase of their criminal coup will unleash blood in the streets.
[00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.969]  That's what's going to happen.
[00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.690]  Because if they have the fake trial in the Senate, which is going to happen now it looks like, a sure thing.
[00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.211]  As I said months ago, it's all rigged.
[00:15:16.231 --> 00:15:29.333]  Even if Trump doesn't get removed by the two-thirds, because they are death-threatening and blackmailing those senators, even if that doesn't happen, then the Democrats are going to get more enraged when Trump
[00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:32.700]  Mike Kavanaugh escapes their hoax.
[00:15:34.021 --> 00:15:37.823]  And I've got a big article up on Infowars.com that is beyond critical.
[00:15:38.944 --> 00:15:43.626]  Only 19 senators are a firm no against impeachment.
[00:15:43.846 --> 00:15:46.368]  And there are whispers some Republicans may turn on Trump.
[00:15:46.428 --> 00:15:47.328]  Of course they are.
[00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:53.112]  The neocons are the greater threat to Trump than the Democrats.
[00:15:53.152 --> 00:15:54.993]  So while everybody laughs at the Democrats,
[00:15:56.288 --> 00:16:06.398]  They've taken over most of the major cities, and have bankrupted the country, and are bringing in millions of, quote, migrants from Islamic countries that literally hate our guts.
[00:16:06.979 --> 00:16:10.963]  They've been kicking the living snot out of this country, and flyover country.
[00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.066]  You know, I love flyover country.
[00:16:15.339 --> 00:16:26.187]  I love Missouri, and Kansas, and Oklahoma, and rural areas of Illinois, and South Dakota, and North Dakota, and Tennessee, and Louisiana, and everywhere.
[00:16:26.467 --> 00:16:27.168]  Good people everywhere.
[00:16:27.188 --> 00:16:27.988]  Good people in New York.
[00:16:28.229 --> 00:16:29.069]  Good people in West Virginia.
[00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:31.871]  Good people in upstate California and Oregon.
[00:16:32.312 --> 00:16:33.272]  They all run the states.
[00:16:33.332 --> 00:16:34.173]  They do the damn work.
[00:16:34.553 --> 00:16:40.898]  Bunch of welfare heads sitting in the cities, running everything, telling us how to live our lives, and trying to have sex with our children.
[00:16:44.858 --> 00:16:46.459]  I couldn't even watch those hearings last week.
[00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:56.847]  I tuned in a couple times and the professors, other than Turley, were always bad-mouthing flyover country, saying people live in the country because they don't like other people.
[00:16:56.967 --> 00:17:00.810]  Democrats live in the cities because we like people.
[00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:08.956]  I mean, they couldn't even shut their mouths about how much they hate rural America on TV.
[00:17:09.817 --> 00:17:11.358]  These people hate us, folks.
[00:17:14.161 --> 00:17:15.342]  Because they live off of us.
[00:17:18.043 --> 00:17:20.584]  And they know that we're not domesticated like them.
[00:17:22.825 --> 00:17:25.567]  And so here's the headline up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:17:45.794 --> 00:17:54.381]  It's now time for you to peacefully and lawfully rise up against the establishment at any event that you can, even if it's a local city council meeting.
[00:17:54.781 --> 00:18:00.927]  It's time to let the government know that it operates only at the consent of the people.
[00:18:05.711 --> 00:18:07.672]  Now, why am I making a bold statement like that?
[00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:10.314]  Because I felt it this morning as Owen
[00:18:11.929 --> 00:18:13.711]  Because I checked the time.
[00:18:14.852 --> 00:18:25.941]  As Owen was confronting Nadler and getting arrested, I literally felt it and got all energized and said, we're going to rise up.
[00:18:26.281 --> 00:18:27.162]  We're going to take America back.
[00:18:27.643 --> 00:18:30.225]  I just envisioned people everywhere doing this.
[00:18:31.326 --> 00:18:39.413]  And it was also because I just read an article that was going to come start the show, not with impeachment, not with the IG report, but with this.
[00:18:44.684 --> 00:18:49.547]  Before Owen stood up in Congress in the middle of the impeachment hearings, which no one else has done.
[00:18:49.567 --> 00:18:53.570]  It's only the leftists that go and do that, and they're allowed to.
[00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.111]  Scream and yell to whoever they want.
[00:18:55.131 --> 00:18:56.352]  They don't get arrested most of the time.
[00:18:58.253 --> 00:19:00.755]  I was going to lead with this and say this is what they fear.
[00:19:00.995 --> 00:19:02.256]  Already before Owen did this.
[00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:04.237]  And again, I know I'm stating the obvious.
[00:19:04.257 --> 00:19:05.218]  That's why we need to do it.
[00:19:05.698 --> 00:19:08.140]  And then we're going to win instead of sitting here and being victims.
[00:19:12.203 --> 00:19:13.724]  Never Trumper Rick Wilson.
[00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:19.374]  Suggest, he didn't suggest, he says do it, putting anti-vaxxers in re-education camps.
[00:19:19.954 --> 00:19:24.718]  Taking their children from them, if they don't take the hundreds of vaccines Big Pharma wants to make us take.
[00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:28.741]  And then it goes on to say, we've got to stop the anti-vaxxers.
[00:19:29.222 --> 00:19:35.987]  They're moving the fight offline, crashing media coverage events, harassing doctors and private citizens.
[00:19:36.507 --> 00:19:43.113]  One group stood with signs outside a pediatrician's office, accosting parents and infants in their arms.
[00:19:44.738 --> 00:19:56.725]  He calls for anti-vaxxers are a scourge and a strong argument for re-education camps, immediate seizure of their property, and putting their children into protective custody.
[00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:58.746]  The never-trumping monster said.
[00:20:00.527 --> 00:20:01.808]  That's what's happening worldwide.
[00:20:01.908 --> 00:20:02.729]  That's their operation.
[00:20:02.749 --> 00:20:03.429]  What are they scared of?
[00:20:03.609 --> 00:20:05.030]  Us saying no to them.
[00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.491]  You know, they tell you safe and effective.
[00:20:06.951 --> 00:20:11.514]  Here's just three vaccine inserts we went and got this morning at Walgreens.
[00:20:14.417 --> 00:20:16.877]  So small, you've got to read it with a magnifying glass.
[00:20:17.798 --> 00:20:23.419]  The MMR shot, the flu shot, and the Gardasil shot.
[00:20:25.879 --> 00:20:32.080]  And I'm going to highlight these today after the show with a magnifying glass I had to buy just to get it done.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.281]  They made the print even smaller.
[00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:36.281]  Here's the flu shot print.
[00:20:37.141 --> 00:20:40.321]  Even with a magnifying glass, you can't read it.
[00:20:42.042 --> 00:20:43.702]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:52.585]  Where it says can kill you, give you Guillain-Barre's, give you cancer, cause type 1 diabetes.
[00:20:54.246 --> 00:20:57.828]  And they want to make you take this and not have you ask questions about it.
[00:20:57.848 --> 00:20:59.529]  So now they've censored folks offline.
[00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:04.572]  Now they want you and your property taken, your children taken, and you put in a re-education camp.
[00:21:04.832 --> 00:21:14.418]  That's a communist term because you questioned Big Pharma with its giant corrupt evil history that has a secret vaccine damage fund paying out billions to damage people.
[00:21:16.328 --> 00:21:25.151]  Rick Wilson, I think he should volunteer to take 100 shots at once, just like the Monsanto guy said he'd drink Roundup, but then when people asked him to, he wouldn't actually drink it.
[00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:28.992]  I think Rick Wilson ought to be liable for everybody that gets damaged by vaccines.
[00:21:29.492 --> 00:21:32.874]  I think Rick Wilson ought to get what he's calling for.
[00:21:32.894 --> 00:21:45.498]  A consortium of globalist bullies of multinational corporations that have had their way with countless third world countries, who've killed millions, who openly back
[00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:47.322]  The CHICOMS.
[00:21:48.483 --> 00:21:57.691]  And the UN is adopting the CHICOM Global Credit System and Face Scan to buy and sell as of last week announced by the UN.
[00:21:58.371 --> 00:21:59.172]  Carried by Reuters.
[00:22:00.233 --> 00:22:06.658]  And Americans have to fight to have free speech online, so now they're hitting the streets like Owen Schroer did.
[00:22:06.698 --> 00:22:08.400]  I sent him up there to cover the impeachment hearings.
[00:22:11.142 --> 00:22:14.165]  Nadler kept it very close to the vest when he's even going to have these events.
[00:22:15.868 --> 00:22:17.289]  So the Republicans aren't ready for it.
[00:22:17.849 --> 00:22:18.450]  Owen was there.
[00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:19.470]  They flew in last night.
[00:22:20.851 --> 00:22:21.812]  He just couldn't help himself.
[00:22:21.852 --> 00:22:23.953]  And he said, you're the ones that are guilty of treason.
[00:22:23.973 --> 00:22:34.179]  Maybe we should try to find that video of Jonathan Turley last week saying, you're the ones that are engaged in high crimes and misdemeanors.
[00:22:34.599 --> 00:22:36.860]  You're the ones that are involved in abuse of power.
[00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:44.305]  If a president can't go to courts and try to block what you're doing to him, then he doesn't
[00:22:45.546 --> 00:22:46.826]  Even hold the office of president.
[00:22:47.106 --> 00:22:48.207]  Citizens have that right.
[00:22:49.767 --> 00:22:51.347]  And now you want to impeach him?
[00:22:53.027 --> 00:22:54.888]  Because you say he's not running the country right?
[00:22:54.948 --> 00:22:56.368]  That's not a high crime or misdemeanor.
[00:22:57.828 --> 00:23:06.150]  Go to DrugsReport.com, you can see right there in the middle column, the link, full video, reporter arrested for calling impeachment hearings a scam.
[00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:10.231]  And you scroll down, we've got the live feed of the show right there if you'd like to be participants.
[00:23:11.525 --> 00:23:13.407]  And share the broadcast with people.
[00:23:13.607 --> 00:23:15.509]  And folks are going to want to know why he was protesting.
[00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:21.496]  But bigger than what Owen did spontaneously, is what are you going to do?
[00:23:22.577 --> 00:23:30.986]  Because they're trying to impeach him right now, and they'll probably vote by the end of this week or early next week, on the indictment of the president that will go to the Senate.
[00:23:32.182 --> 00:23:41.584]  Are you going to show up for that, or are you just going to let George Soros and Facebook, NowThis, and hundreds of groups run around and do whatever they want?
[00:23:43.445 --> 00:23:48.186]  That's a question that you've got to ask yourself.
[00:23:50.286 --> 00:23:52.587]  That's a question we all have to ask ourselves.
[00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:54.727]  What are we going to do?
[00:23:54.807 --> 00:23:57.808]  Our crew is going to be out there tomorrow in Pennsylvania.
[00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:00.709]  Antifa has been threatening to kill people.
[00:24:01.755 --> 00:24:04.877]  Local Patriot Group had a local restaurant bar rented out to have an event.
[00:24:04.957 --> 00:24:06.138]  Antifa's bomb-threaded it.
[00:24:06.458 --> 00:24:14.383]  Just got the word, so they've had to cancel that event because conservatives and patriots can't even meet in any city now without Antifa calling in bomb-threats.
[00:24:15.184 --> 00:24:18.086]  Communist terrorists who want to silence us.
[00:24:18.306 --> 00:24:24.430]  But they can't silence you at sporting events, college, NFL, collegiate.
[00:24:26.051 --> 00:24:28.732]  They can't silence you at these congressional hearings.
[00:24:28.752 --> 00:24:30.854]  They can't silence you outside the hearings.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.062]  They can't silence you at City Council meetings and State House meetings.
[00:24:35.322 --> 00:24:38.664]  They can't stop you on street corners or at your church.
[00:24:41.025 --> 00:24:46.228]  Now is the time to get out of the coma and to get aggressive and get active, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:46.868 --> 00:24:48.249]  We now have Owen.
[00:24:48.569 --> 00:24:49.869]  You can see him there on the screen.
[00:24:49.889 --> 00:24:50.810]  We'll put him up there.
[00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.992]  We're going to him here in just a few moments.
[00:24:54.012 --> 00:24:56.413]  We've got him punched up on the Skype.
[00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:06.891]  We're going to talk to Owen.
[00:25:09.192 --> 00:25:10.173]  And then when I start.
[00:25:13.255 --> 00:25:13.856]  The next hour.
[00:25:16.994 --> 00:25:20.895]  I'm going to get into the top story I was going to cover today because it ties into all of this.
[00:25:21.415 --> 00:25:25.417]  And it's a life and death situation and it's paramount to what we face as a culture and a civilization.
[00:25:25.837 --> 00:25:33.559]  And I've got my crack team of present, focused crew in there that are watching for the minute the Inspector General report comes out.
[00:25:34.219 --> 00:25:39.021]  The second that happens, we're going to be covering it live here today as well.
[00:25:39.061 --> 00:25:42.382]  But let's put all that up on screen right here.
[00:25:42.402 --> 00:25:43.742]  Let's just look at this patriot.
[00:25:45.447 --> 00:25:48.689]  And the great work he's done and how hard he's fighting.
[00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.170]  Yeah, we'll put that Skype feed up there.
[00:25:55.133 --> 00:25:58.035]  Because that's an American patriot.
[00:25:59.816 --> 00:26:03.698]  That's an American patriot that's taking action.
[00:26:04.779 --> 00:26:09.982]  That's simply going out and exercising his free speech in the face of these tyrants that have had a rigged event.
[00:26:11.377 --> 00:26:21.142]  They created their articles of impeachment months ago, and then had it in the bowels of the Intelligence Committee, with the rogue intelligence groups, admittedly saying, we're going to have a coup against the President.
[00:26:21.363 --> 00:26:28.546]  From the lawyers, to the fake whistleblowers, to the former CIA directors Brennan and others, bragging on television that they were having a coup with the President.
[00:26:28.847 --> 00:26:33.989]  Going from denying there was a deep state, and a rogue government bureaucracy, to bragging about it.
[00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:40.053]  And now they believe they can force their will, not just on Trump, but on the American people and the world.
[00:26:42.199 --> 00:26:43.420]  I think they've jumped the shark.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.801]  I think you're going to stand up to them.
[00:26:44.861 --> 00:26:46.582]  I think you have a right and a duty to.
[00:26:47.523 --> 00:26:49.064]  And I think they need to go to prison.
[00:26:50.285 --> 00:26:58.672]  They're used to never getting in trouble because the big corrupt system wants to look like it's invincible and they never, never send anybody to jail so they can all just have a giant crime spree.
[00:27:00.253 --> 00:27:06.037]  And now they've gone too far and that crime spree is coming to an end because they could have just backed off and let us fix the country and turn things around.
[00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:10.661]  But they believe they can beat us and silence us one more time.
[00:27:11.906 --> 00:27:19.574]  They think they can bully us and sue us and threaten us and arrest us and intimidate us until we submit to them and just go away and just shut up.
[00:27:19.734 --> 00:27:20.615]  But we're not doing that.
[00:27:22.136 --> 00:27:26.421]  You know, President Trump was reportedly asking Jared Kushner and others, where's Drudge?
[00:27:26.881 --> 00:27:29.444]  Why isn't he supporting me as much as he used to?
[00:27:32.213 --> 00:27:37.155]  I think the answer is, President, you've not been supporting your supporters that have been persecuted.
[00:27:37.175 --> 00:27:44.757]  And we understand the swamp isn't following your orders, but we need you to come out against big tech censorship and racketeering and election meddling and voter suppression.
[00:27:45.217 --> 00:27:48.699]  We need action from you against the deep state.
[00:27:49.639 --> 00:27:50.499]  And we do support you.
[00:27:50.519 --> 00:28:01.543]  Now I'm going to go to break and come back with Owen Schroer here today, but I cannot build up enough how important it is what he did.
[00:28:02.622 --> 00:28:05.725]  How amazing it is what Owen did.
[00:28:06.746 --> 00:28:08.328]  How critical what Owen did is.
[00:28:08.408 --> 00:28:22.101]  Because if we don't stop watching football every weekend, instead of going and being heard, if we don't start getting very, very active, the globalists, as sure as the sun came up, are going to remove the president.
[00:28:22.822 --> 00:28:26.906]  And then once they've done that, they're going to come after everyone because they want to destroy flyover country.
[00:28:27.694 --> 00:28:41.522]  I'm gonna go to break and come back with Owen, but please, another way you can stand with us in this fight, as we are planning to do a lot of things out there in the streets of America, to hopefully trigger you to take more action, is fund us.

[00:30:55.745 --> 00:30:56.305]  We're fighting.
[00:30:56.365 --> 00:30:57.206]  We're taking action.
[00:30:57.486 --> 00:30:59.726]  And when you provision us, it's like buying war bonds.
[00:30:59.986 --> 00:31:00.866]  It's so critical.
[00:31:01.267 --> 00:31:04.147]  Just as important as word of mouth and prayer is the financial support.
[00:31:04.427 --> 00:31:05.567]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:31:06.708 --> 00:31:07.748]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:31:08.951 --> 00:31:15.834]  I am Alex Jones, your host, Owen Schroyer, got on an airplane last night with more of our crew.
[00:31:15.894 --> 00:31:22.477]  The armored vehicle was driven up by a crew member, by a truck driver, we've got hired to do it, to D.C.
[00:31:22.617 --> 00:31:32.622]  It's there right now, and they're linking up to go to the Hershey, Pennsylvania Trump-Pence event tomorrow night, and then they're going to be back in D.C.
[00:31:33.763 --> 00:31:35.705]  They're also having an event in Hershey tomorrow.
[00:31:36.125 --> 00:31:40.189]  I just heard from the event organizers there's been bomb threats and more so they've canceled that.
[00:31:40.609 --> 00:31:47.035]  The communist terrorists again are pushing us offline with the help of big tech and they're now trying to silence us on the ground.
[00:31:47.075 --> 00:31:47.956]  That's not going to work.
[00:31:48.456 --> 00:31:54.822]  Everyone needs to hit the streets and be in the face of the globalists whether it's in your small town or whether it's in the nation's capital.
[00:31:55.442 --> 00:32:03.367]  Owen Schroyer is here to break down what happened today, why he did it, what happened behind the scenes, and what it was like.
[00:32:03.407 --> 00:32:08.670]  It's a big national story right now and is really dangerous for the globalists.
[00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:22.198]  If it triggers more people to go cover the events, and legally and lawfully from outside the committee room, let their voices be heard to the media, jumping in front of live feeds, things like that.
[00:32:23.118 --> 00:32:25.119]  Again, this is the time for action, Owen.
[00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:30.480]  Yeah, and Alex, that's what they're really afraid of.
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:38.542]  They can arrest Owen Schroer and put me in jail for a couple hours and make me show up to court and try to intimidate me, but they can't do it to everyone.
[00:32:38.982 --> 00:32:40.743]  And that's how we can change the world, Alex.
[00:32:40.783 --> 00:32:41.123]  But you know,
[00:32:42.163 --> 00:32:47.685]  I've had Congressman Al Green inside a riot against me last night calling me a racist.
[00:32:47.985 --> 00:32:48.865]  I showed up today.
[00:32:48.885 --> 00:32:52.106]  I spoke out during the impeachment scam hearings.
[00:32:52.466 --> 00:32:53.227]  I got arrested.
[00:32:53.247 --> 00:32:54.087]  I went to jail.
[00:32:54.427 --> 00:32:56.968]  Now I'm standing out here in the freezing rain filing reports.
[00:32:57.408 --> 00:32:58.788]  There's nobody that can do this, folks.
[00:32:59.008 --> 00:33:01.389]  Only at InfoWars are you going to see coverage like this.
[00:33:01.429 --> 00:33:10.272]  But Alex, you know, I have to say I'm a little ticked off at the fact that I get arrested for disrupting Congress
[00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:31.108]  Okay, 60 seconds or less of my disruption in Congress, I go to jail, I'm booked, they had to take my fingerprints and everything, gave me a search, I'm due in court in a month, but Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats get to disrupt Congress for three plus years and not a single person has been arrested.
[00:33:31.408 --> 00:33:39.391]  Now look, I don't need President Trump to say that he knows me, I don't need a notification or anything from Trump, but man, President Trump,
[00:33:40.097 --> 00:33:46.121]  If you don't do something about these damn treasonous Democrats, then I'm gonna be pissed, man!
[00:33:46.502 --> 00:33:47.022]  I don't care!
[00:33:47.062 --> 00:33:51.285]  I'll come take the slings and arrows, just like Trump is doing right now, at the very top of this deal.
[00:33:51.725 --> 00:34:03.494]  But man, if I get arrested and I have to go to court and all this crap for a less than 60 seconds disruption of Congress, when Congressman Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff are doing that every day,
[00:34:04.174 --> 00:34:06.137]  Man, that's not how this country works.
[00:34:06.297 --> 00:34:07.118]  That's not justice.
[00:34:07.518 --> 00:34:09.040]  That's backwards, Alex.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:09.681]  That's right.
[00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:12.323]  Letting it happen is aiding and abetting it and expanding on that.
[00:34:17.315 --> 00:34:19.617]  They knowingly lied during the election and after.
[00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:21.118]  They had illegal wiretaps.
[00:34:21.698 --> 00:34:26.782]  They lied to Congress and now they've got new lies to obstruct the operation of our country.
[00:34:27.142 --> 00:34:33.347]  They've admittedly been trying to plunge the economy to sabotage our populist uprising to peacefully take our country back.
[00:34:33.827 --> 00:34:34.808]  And you're absolutely right.
[00:34:35.128 --> 00:34:38.331]  And putting up with this and the Justice Department doing nothing...
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:45.946]  And really catering to all this has encouraged the type of criminal activity we've seen until now Democrats are everywhere calling for violence.
[00:34:46.426 --> 00:34:47.888]  And Trump supporters to die.
[00:34:48.248 --> 00:34:49.309]  And for Trump to die.
[00:34:49.549 --> 00:34:50.730]  And for his family to die.
[00:34:51.031 --> 00:34:53.413]  And his son to be attacked in the damn Congress.
[00:34:53.673 --> 00:34:56.295]  So we're telling Trump, take the gloves off!
[00:34:56.496 --> 00:34:57.897]  We're taking them off, aren't we Owen?
[00:34:59.113 --> 00:34:59.854]  Well, that's the question.
[00:34:59.894 --> 00:35:01.755]  When is the break-back moment here, Alex?
[00:35:01.875 --> 00:35:02.876]  I mean, it could have been today.
[00:35:03.256 --> 00:35:04.998]  I know there are patriots in that room with me.
[00:35:05.478 --> 00:35:09.522]  I know that there's probably patriots that are inside the police force that don't like what's going on.
[00:35:09.982 --> 00:35:16.948]  You know, today they decided not to rise up and, you know, let me get arrested and hauled out of there and Jerry Nadler have me arrested probably and, you know.
[00:35:17.368 --> 00:35:18.889]  But when is the break-back moment?
[00:35:18.929 --> 00:35:19.990]  When are people going to say, you know what?
[00:35:20.151 --> 00:35:22.332]  No, Owens-Royer is not the criminal here.
[00:35:22.853 --> 00:35:25.255]  No, Owens-Royer is not the one disrupting Congress here.
[00:35:25.655 --> 00:35:27.537]  No, Trump is not the problem with this country.
[00:35:27.557 --> 00:35:30.320]  Somebody's got to take the whiskey bottle away from the Democrats.
[00:35:31.241 --> 00:35:32.141]  When is it going to happen?
[00:35:32.201 --> 00:35:34.724]  And look, I didn't expect it to happen today, but it could have.
[00:35:35.004 --> 00:35:36.305]  I know there were Patriots in that room.
[00:35:36.666 --> 00:35:41.791]  Dozens of people could have stood up and started shouting down Jerry Nadler for the treason that they know he's guilty of.
[00:35:41.811 --> 00:35:44.113]  And I want to be clear, this is fruit of the poison tree.
[00:35:44.493 --> 00:35:46.535]  They admit it was done in secret, in the wrong committee.
[00:35:47.176 --> 00:35:54.379]  Now it's come out that Schiff was wiretapping people, then leaking it illegally, and acting like the wiretap shows something criminal, which it doesn't.
[00:35:55.179 --> 00:36:09.104]  The ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, Nunes, his colleague that sits afoot from him, talking to Trump, they're now leaking members of the Intelligence Committee talking to the President, acting like that's illegal?
[00:36:09.524 --> 00:36:12.465]  The crime is the frickin' spying on the President!
[00:36:12.745 --> 00:36:15.926]  And Congress, you little chicken-necked devil worshipper Schiff!
[00:36:17.301 --> 00:36:18.745]  Yeah, and beyond, Alex.
[00:36:18.765 --> 00:36:23.877]  So again, you know, people saw what I did today, and hopefully it's enough inspiration to...
[00:36:24.836 --> 00:36:29.477]  Make a real call to action or a desire to take action, because that's what it's going to take.
[00:36:29.757 --> 00:36:32.738]  If it's one person every time, then the system's going to win.
[00:36:33.098 --> 00:36:35.279]  They can haul me away, put me in jail, put me in court.
[00:36:35.619 --> 00:36:38.059]  If it's one person every time, the system will win every time.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.740]  But if it's one person and then two people, then three, then four, then five.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:47.502]  They would have had to shut that hearing down if twenty people, one after the next, got up and said, you've been obstructing America.
[00:36:47.802 --> 00:36:48.603]  You've been lying.
[00:36:48.823 --> 00:36:50.945]  You've been using your investigative power for fraud.
[00:36:51.185 --> 00:36:52.206]  You need to go to prison.
[00:36:52.446 --> 00:36:56.769]  If the FBI and the Justice Department won't do their job, the American people are going to start doing it.
[00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.751]  But Alex, let's be clear here.
[00:36:59.662 --> 00:37:04.587]  There is nothing that Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff fear more than the American people's right to free speech.
[00:37:04.687 --> 00:37:05.668]  They don't fear violence.
[00:37:05.728 --> 00:37:07.169]  We're not violent revolutionaries.
[00:37:07.189 --> 00:37:07.790]  They know that.
[00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:09.211]  We're not going to come at them violently.
[00:37:09.571 --> 00:37:11.053]  No one's threatening Jerry Nadler.
[00:37:11.113 --> 00:37:12.294]  Nobody's threatening with violence.
[00:37:12.714 --> 00:37:19.240]  But oh, if people show up to Jerry Nadler's rigged hearings and start shouting him down, guess what?
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.363]  Jerry Nadler's going to start pooping his oversized pants.
[00:37:22.543 --> 00:37:39.140]  Democrats official policy is to is to go to Republican events and shut them down and have universities ban speech and everything else but they get 60 seconds from you saying what Professor Turley said that what they're doing is illegal what they're doing is impeachable oh then you've got to be arrested and indicted
[00:37:40.478 --> 00:37:41.419]  So that's the action.
[00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:42.620]  That's the answer, Alex.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:48.906]  Someday, I don't know when it's going to be, but someday, someone is going to feel inspired enough to stand up and say, you know what?
[00:37:48.986 --> 00:37:51.788]  No, I agree with that man you're trying to arrest right now who's innocent.
[00:37:51.988 --> 00:37:52.829]  And then another person.
[00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:54.130]  And then it's a tidal wave, Alex.
[00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:56.412]  And then there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[00:37:56.672 --> 00:37:58.714]  And then all of America is awakened.
[00:37:59.035 --> 00:38:03.699]  And the crooks like Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff, they'll be the ones hiding from police.
[00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:06.790]  Owen, I want you to stay there for a couple more segments.
[00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:12.461]  I know you've got to get back to work there, and I'm not going to let folks even know the next moves, because I've told you guys, do whatever it is you think is best.
[00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:16.088]  But we've got a lot planned there in Hershey, Pennsylvania tomorrow and more.
[00:38:16.188 --> 00:38:16.870]  But, Owen.
[00:38:18.166 --> 00:38:36.075]  When we come back, I want to talk about why you decided to do that today and then their response and the fact just at a grassroots level that I was literally telling my wife while you were doing it, I have a feeling that the uprising is going to begin today and that people are just going to hit the streets and that I have faith in the American people and it's going to happen.
[00:38:36.095 --> 00:38:37.056]  We're going to beat them.
[00:38:37.836 --> 00:38:39.317]  And I literally was electrified.
[00:38:39.357 --> 00:38:42.999]  My wife was like, whoa, you know, you are like on fire.
[00:38:43.059 --> 00:38:44.980]  She said, you're like, like electricity coming through you.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.261]  But that was the very minute I checked.
[00:38:48.029 --> 00:38:50.852]  Because I learned five minutes later, people started calling me, that you were doing that.
[00:38:50.892 --> 00:38:53.654]  I could feel the literal spiritual force.
[00:38:54.175 --> 00:38:54.976]  But I want to point something out.
[00:38:54.996 --> 00:38:55.897]  That's because it's God, Alex.
[00:38:56.137 --> 00:38:57.118]  That's because it's God.
[00:38:57.158 --> 00:38:57.598]  It's not me.
[00:38:57.618 --> 00:38:58.519]  It's not me.
[00:38:58.539 --> 00:38:58.980]  Absolutely.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.862]  And I could feel the disturbance of the force.
[00:39:00.882 --> 00:39:01.903]  We're going to talk about it when we come back.
[00:39:03.456 --> 00:39:05.317]  We have a multimedia operation.
[00:39:05.357 --> 00:39:06.618]  Radio, TV, Internet.
[00:39:06.698 --> 00:39:07.559]  Drudge linked to us.
[00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:08.880]  That helped boost it massively.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:11.521]  It was something like a half million people on the page right before we went live.
[00:39:11.541 --> 00:39:12.542]  I don't even know what it is right now.
[00:39:12.582 --> 00:39:15.824]  The page he's linked to, that Drudge is linked to, right in the middle column.
[00:39:16.365 --> 00:39:17.746]  People keep asking, what's going on with Drudge?
[00:39:17.886 --> 00:39:18.886]  He wants action.
[00:39:18.926 --> 00:39:19.887]  He wants resistance.
[00:39:20.167 --> 00:39:21.828]  He wants us to take the left on.
[00:39:22.289 --> 00:39:28.192]  If Trump's going to sit there and just act like everything's okay, then, you know, why not go ahead and run with the leftist headlines?
[00:39:28.613 --> 00:39:29.894]  That's what this is coming down to.
[00:39:29.974 --> 00:39:31.575]  We need to get out of the mud.
[00:39:31.915 --> 00:39:32.936]  We need to take action.
[00:39:33.776 --> 00:39:45.192]  And the fact that Infowars even exist, they hate it so much that we can show you what's really happening, that we can let people know that the only voice is not the corporate globalist deceptive Chai-com-backed voice.
[00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:46.634]  So this is an amazing time.
[00:39:46.654 --> 00:39:47.535]  I'm gonna say it again to listeners.
[00:39:48.176 --> 00:39:49.738]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the Hyaluronic.
[00:39:50.856 --> 00:40:04.034]  Super silver skin cream that has the vitamins, the minerals, and women that know about this, that go to Ulta and get high-end brands that are twice the cost for just hyaluronic acid, read this and they go, oh my gosh, coconut oil.
[00:40:05.728 --> 00:40:14.837]  And it's got the silver solution, and it's got the other high quality essential oils in it, and the hyaluronic acid.
[00:40:15.538 --> 00:40:17.780]  The 3.4 ounce tubes are back in stock.
[00:40:18.201 --> 00:40:22.946]  Great gifts for your wife, great gifts for your husband, because this isn't just about skin looking good.
[00:40:23.366 --> 00:40:25.709]  This is a silver barrier, patented.
[00:40:26.573 --> 00:40:30.576]  That protects you from the viruses and the bacteria at the skin level.
[00:40:30.976 --> 00:40:32.558]  It really is next level.
[00:40:32.898 --> 00:40:34.459]  Look at those 100% reviews.
[00:40:34.479 --> 00:40:36.461]  We have it without the essential oil.
[00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:37.982]  We have it with the essential oil.
[00:40:38.022 --> 00:40:40.584]  We have it in the smaller one-ounce tubes as well.
[00:40:40.924 --> 00:40:43.286]  That's discounted 25% off.
[00:40:43.626 --> 00:40:45.307]  When we do it at 50% off, that was a mistake.
[00:40:45.368 --> 00:40:46.709]  That's at cost when we do that.
[00:40:46.869 --> 00:40:48.610]  We can't run everything at cost anymore.
[00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:53.334]  A lot of the items you see being sold at cost right now is because we're clearing inventory of great products.
[00:40:53.894 --> 00:41:00.677]  Just to fund ourselves in the next year, and the next year prices have to go up, because I've actually been doing the accounting and the modeling just to keep us on air through 2020.
[00:41:01.297 --> 00:41:04.458]  So please, get products you need at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:41:20.239 --> 00:41:21.660]  All right, I am really fired up.
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.502]  If you just joined us, Owen Schwerer got arrested this morning, our great reporter.
[00:41:25.403 --> 00:41:30.967]  He just spontaneously, as a citizen, had to say something to Nadler at the beginning of this illegal process.
[00:41:31.588 --> 00:41:33.589]  And they say they've got the votes, they're going to go to the Senate.
[00:41:33.769 --> 00:41:35.251]  The others say they may have the votes in the Senate.
[00:41:35.971 --> 00:41:36.712]  I sense danger.
[00:41:36.772 --> 00:41:37.212]  I see it.
[00:41:38.673 --> 00:41:39.714]  Lord Vader is in danger.
[00:41:39.734 --> 00:41:43.017]  Owen, you've got the floor of this segment, the next, because I was interrupting.
[00:41:43.457 --> 00:41:44.217]  I'm so wound up.
[00:41:44.718 --> 00:41:45.438]  Why did you do it?
[00:41:45.538 --> 00:41:46.339]  What was it like?
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.361]  What happened behind the scenes?
[00:41:48.401 --> 00:41:49.922]  And then what is your message to the American people?
[00:41:51.752 --> 00:42:00.835]  Well, Alex, anybody who has been following me knows that I'm not afraid to confront a crowd of people, or a congressman, or really anybody.
[00:42:01.535 --> 00:42:09.538]  But specifically in this incident, I was harboring some regrets, Alex, because we were down here in D.C.
[00:42:09.598 --> 00:42:12.999]  about a month ago, and forgive me if I'm shivering, there's freezing rain happening right now.
[00:42:14.159 --> 00:42:16.500]  By the way, no one else will sit out here and do this report, folks.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.300]  Only InfoWars.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.281]  You can check me on that.
[00:42:18.601 --> 00:42:19.041]  Guaranteed.
[00:42:19.966 --> 00:42:25.110]  But Alex, I was harboring some regret because I didn't stand up during the Roger Stone hearings.
[00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.052]  I didn't stand up during the Roger Stone trials.
[00:42:27.092 --> 00:42:28.493]  And I knew that was a rigged trial.
[00:42:28.953 --> 00:42:30.294]  We knew what they were doing to Roger.
[00:42:31.095 --> 00:42:34.597]  We knew they were rigging the jury and rigging the prosecution and the judge and everything.
[00:42:35.498 --> 00:42:36.499]  And I sat there.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.500]  And I obeyed the system.
[00:42:38.741 --> 00:42:41.843]  And I was a good little slave and a good little peon and I didn't say anything.
[00:42:41.863 --> 00:42:42.884]  And I regretted it.
[00:42:43.624 --> 00:42:48.028]  And I didn't want to take that same regret back to Austin, Texas with me this time.
[00:42:49.085 --> 00:42:50.586]  And it was probably providential.
[00:42:51.467 --> 00:42:56.610]  Obviously, I love Roger Stone and he's an innocent man and we want him freed and we hope he gets a presidential pardon.
[00:42:56.650 --> 00:43:06.036]  But on the overall aggregate of things, the impeachment against Trump is just a little bit bigger than the Roger Stone rigged case.
[00:43:06.796 --> 00:43:14.601]  And so I knew that there was no way I could come back to Austin, Texas without confronting Jerry Nadler and the Democrats.
[00:43:15.621 --> 00:43:17.823]  And there's another element to this, Alex.
[00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:23.773]  You know, InfoWars, people don't want to give us the respect we deserve, and that's fine.
[00:43:23.813 --> 00:43:24.774]  We'll be the Dark Knight.
[00:43:25.094 --> 00:43:35.081]  But, you know, I hope that people in the media and Republicans in Congress saw what we did here today, and they realize, guess what?
[00:43:35.141 --> 00:43:36.382]  There's people that are still out there.
[00:43:36.862 --> 00:43:37.943]  There's people that are ticked off.
[00:43:37.983 --> 00:43:39.024]  There's people that are fed up.
[00:43:39.804 --> 00:43:44.187]  And if you're a Republican in Congress and you're fed up, well, it's time to speak up.
[00:43:44.948 --> 00:43:45.969]  It's time to take action.
[00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:47.610]  And so maybe
[00:43:48.467 --> 00:43:54.110]  This one little act of resistance today can inspire ten acts of resistance tomorrow.
[00:43:54.551 --> 00:43:57.012]  And then those acts can inspire a thousand next week.
[00:43:57.412 --> 00:43:58.613]  And so on and so forth.
[00:43:58.973 --> 00:44:04.977]  And then we won't have to deal with these rigged hearings and fake impeachment scams and Jerry Nadler's and Adam Schiff's.
[00:44:05.017 --> 00:44:06.878]  But we got a long way to go, Alex.
[00:44:07.198 --> 00:44:14.663]  But unless you take that first step, I forget the old adage, but... The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:16.221]  Exactly.
[00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:26.336]  So this was maybe not a single set for me today, perhaps maybe a long stride or one in many strides, but I just hope that people realize you have the power, folks!
[00:44:27.071 --> 00:44:30.792]  I mean, yeah, you're gonna, I mean, don't get me wrong, the system is gonna try to crush you.
[00:44:31.092 --> 00:44:32.752]  I mean, look at what's happened to us.
[00:44:33.132 --> 00:44:39.653]  I don't need to go into details, but again, look at the censorship we endure, look at the attacks that we endure, and then look at the action we take.
[00:44:39.673 --> 00:44:49.535]  But America and the world has gotten into this because nobody wants to put skin in the game, and we've laid down to so much that now, don't say mother and father, teach five-year-olds how to have sex with adults.
[00:44:49.995 --> 00:44:54.036]  I mean, true evil's out in the open because it has a hunger, and we haven't had a hunger for freedom.
[00:44:54.056 --> 00:44:54.496]  Well, guess what?
[00:44:54.516 --> 00:44:55.396]  The hunger is back.
[00:44:56.056 --> 00:44:57.216]  We're going to break here in a minute.
[00:44:57.236 --> 00:45:00.397]  I want to come back, Owen, and talk more about this.
[00:45:00.437 --> 00:45:01.857]  You're not allowed in the Capitol right now.
[00:45:01.877 --> 00:45:03.858]  I guess they'll let you back in.
[00:45:03.878 --> 00:45:06.559]  I was the one saying shoot live in front of the Capitol.
[00:45:06.599 --> 00:45:09.339]  Sorry you're freezing to death out there, but it is a powerful shot.
[00:45:09.879 --> 00:45:14.480]  But when we come back, I want to set the table here for what's coming next if we don't take action.
[00:45:14.961 --> 00:45:20.142]  But the fact that almost no one is actually confronting these people and no one's calling them on it,
[00:45:20.842 --> 00:45:24.605]  That's why it makes it so big when you said you're the ones guilty of treason.
[00:45:24.645 --> 00:45:26.047]  You're the ones selling the nation out.
[00:45:26.667 --> 00:45:33.433]  As Professor Turley said, that's why it's all over the news and so huge right now and why a million people are on that article.
[00:45:33.733 --> 00:45:37.857]  The DrugsReport.com link to right there in the middle has got the live feed of this show and what you did.
[00:45:38.338 --> 00:45:43.122]  Because in a nation of people not taking action, the man that does stand up is King.
[00:45:43.542 --> 00:45:45.805]  I mean, look at how you took action right there.
[00:45:46.366 --> 00:45:47.767]  It's like the emperor's new clothes.
[00:45:47.787 --> 00:45:49.830]  A little kid that stands up and says the emperor is naked.
[00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.891]  You just did that.
[00:45:50.931 --> 00:45:51.592]  We'll be right back.
[00:45:51.873 --> 00:45:52.533]  Owen Schroeder.
[00:45:54.536 --> 00:45:58.120]  The energy level on this planet and in this country is off the charts.
[00:45:58.221 --> 00:46:00.624]  We are at the crossroads right now deciding
[00:46:02.605 --> 00:46:05.206]  The future destiny of humanity at a level never before done.
[00:46:05.286 --> 00:46:10.488]  Owen Schroer arrested this morning for simply getting up for 60 seconds.
[00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:11.969]  He didn't resist.
[00:46:12.009 --> 00:46:14.129]  He's just saying, you're the ones that are guilty of treason.
[00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.891]  You're the ones that are obstructing this nation.
[00:46:16.911 --> 00:46:18.591]  You're the ones that are lying about the president.
[00:46:18.611 --> 00:46:20.832]  You're the ones that want to impeach him for thought crime.
[00:46:21.252 --> 00:46:25.674]  You're the ones that have been caught lying and haven't been following the Constitutional Bill of Rights and this procedure.
[00:46:26.354 --> 00:46:27.995]  And that's exactly what in that same
[00:46:29.158 --> 00:46:32.539]  Judiciary Committee, this all began in the Intelligence Committee, down in the basement.
[00:46:33.639 --> 00:46:45.142]  That's exactly what liberal law professor Jonathan Turley said last week, what Owens said to their faces, the evil citizen exercising his speech in that rigged kangaroo event.
[00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:45.602]  Here it is.
[00:46:46.643 --> 00:46:49.483]  I can't emphasize this enough and I'll say it just one more time.
[00:46:51.704 --> 00:46:55.105]  If you impeach a president, if you make a high crime
[00:46:56.181 --> 00:47:01.004]  In misdemeanor, out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power.
[00:47:02.145 --> 00:47:03.186]  It's your abuse of power.
[00:47:04.567 --> 00:47:07.749]  You're doing precisely what you're criticizing the President for doing.
[00:47:08.369 --> 00:47:12.012]  We have a third branch that deals with conflicts of the other two branches.
[00:47:13.233 --> 00:47:17.456]  And what comes out of there, and what you do with it, is the very definition of legitimacy.
[00:47:18.564 --> 00:47:22.648]  Now, here's what Owen said this morning, and the left's calling for him to be imprisoned.
[00:47:23.188 --> 00:47:24.670]  They're calling for his death on Twitter.
[00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:26.271]  I mean, it is just insane.
[00:47:26.291 --> 00:47:28.133]  They're telling him, you don't have any power.
[00:47:28.153 --> 00:47:30.275]  We're going to indict your president.
[00:47:30.315 --> 00:47:31.176]  He's going to be removed.
[00:47:31.196 --> 00:47:32.257]  We're coming for you next.
[00:47:32.277 --> 00:47:42.566]  They're so angry that nationalists and the silent majority, the sleeping giant, might actually wake up, might actually take action, that you might peacefully, legally and lawfully take action.
[00:47:42.907 --> 00:47:44.148]  Here's what Owen had to say.
[00:48:00.846 --> 00:48:04.951]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country!
[00:48:05.211 --> 00:48:08.215]  And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes!
[00:48:08.255 --> 00:48:09.476]  You are, Jerry Nadler!
[00:48:09.816 --> 00:48:11.238]  You're the one committing treason!
[00:48:11.538 --> 00:48:12.740]  America's done with this!
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.163]  America's sick of the treason committed by the Democrat Party!
[00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:34.515]  Look at all those prostitutes.
[00:48:34.595 --> 00:48:36.136]  If you back the video about 10 seconds.
[00:48:36.937 --> 00:48:38.458]  All lapdogs of the system.
[00:48:39.379 --> 00:48:41.280]  All loving Assange in prison.
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.482]  All loving the attacks on real whistleblowers by Obama.
[00:48:44.742 --> 00:48:45.943]  And then lying about Trump.
[00:48:46.403 --> 00:48:57.726]  And the American people constantly, good little lapdogs, reporting on the rigged event, the Matrix event, that Neo just came into the middle of.
[00:48:58.546 --> 00:49:04.227]  Going back to Owen Schroer, right outside the Capitol in D.C., where this criminal coup is taking place.
[00:49:04.367 --> 00:49:06.628]  Owen, other points and what's coming next?
[00:49:08.257 --> 00:49:11.238]  Well, we've got some things up our sleeve, obviously, for the rest of the week.
[00:49:11.258 --> 00:49:13.759]  There's a Trump rally, big Trump rally, in Pennsylvania.
[00:49:13.779 --> 00:49:14.860]  It's a battleground state.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.801]  It's not too far from D.C.
[00:49:16.881 --> 00:49:23.543]  and the East Coast, so you assume that the left is going to bust Antifa or Trump protesters out there.
[00:49:23.583 --> 00:49:31.987]  But, you know, back to what happened today, I think that probably Jerry Nadler had more fear today than he ever had in his life.
[00:49:32.027 --> 00:49:37.329]  And that's not because of anything physical, not because we're going to be violent, but because he saw someone stand up against him.
[00:49:37.944 --> 00:49:39.225]  And these people are not used to that.
[00:49:39.705 --> 00:49:41.547]  They're used to just running America over.
[00:49:42.127 --> 00:49:44.349]  They're used to just defying American law.
[00:49:44.389 --> 00:49:44.850]  It's amazing.
[00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:46.871]  Once you get in Congress, you can just do whatever the hell you want.
[00:49:46.891 --> 00:49:47.972]  You're above the law, apparently.
[00:49:48.592 --> 00:49:52.115]  So, they can disrupt Congress, but I'm not allowed to do so.
[00:49:52.576 --> 00:50:00.562]  Maybe this starts a wave of citizen activism against this Democrat treason, and that's what it deserves.
[00:50:01.002 --> 00:50:01.763]  Because if, look,
[00:50:02.478 --> 00:50:06.865]  Folks, I mean, we can sit here and ask Trump to do stuff all day long, and believe me, I get it.
[00:50:07.245 --> 00:50:10.530]  But if we're not going to take action, then can we really blame Trump?
[00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:13.895]  If you're not going to take action, can you really blame Trump for anything?
[00:50:14.916 --> 00:50:16.238]  I don't know if that's really fair.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:21.141]  And yeah, it's frustrating to see this going on, but again, this is our country, Alex.
[00:50:21.241 --> 00:50:22.581]  I mean, this is America.
[00:50:22.641 --> 00:50:29.203]  This is the American citizens who run this country, not Jerry Nadler or Adam Schiff or Nancy Pelosi, okay?
[00:50:29.543 --> 00:50:37.186]  They work for their constituents, but it hasn't been that way because their constituents have been asleep for so long, so they've been doing whatever they want.
[00:50:37.246 --> 00:50:44.988]  But you know, Alex, as we're standing out here, the rain keeps coming down harder, it keeps getting colder, but I just want to say this to the InfoWars audience.
[00:50:45.603 --> 00:50:47.685]  You know that you have our commitment.
[00:50:48.666 --> 00:50:59.795]  And I said before I left, I want to fund this trip with the audience going to InfoWarsStore.com and just buying the limited edition Space Force t-shirt.
[00:50:59.815 --> 00:51:02.196]  I wanted to sell 10,000 or however many we have left.
[00:51:02.236 --> 00:51:03.437]  It's a limited edition t-shirt.
[00:51:03.878 --> 00:51:05.099]  But this is how we do what we do.
[00:51:05.739 --> 00:51:08.101]  And I'm just going to be perfectly clear right now.
[00:51:08.121 --> 00:51:10.403]  I'm going to be perfectly honest with the audience.
[00:51:12.083 --> 00:51:18.966]  Alex Jones has offered me a lot of raises and a lot of bonuses, and I turned them down, folks, because I want him to invest in the company.
[00:51:19.226 --> 00:51:20.507]  And look at how far it's come.
[00:51:20.807 --> 00:51:23.809]  We're still here, despite all the censorship.
[00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:25.849]  And I'm thankful because, hey, I've been censored.
[00:51:25.869 --> 00:51:28.391]  It's no secret all the platforms that I've been banned off of, too.
[00:51:28.651 --> 00:51:35.474]  So I thank God for this audience supporting InfoWars so that I can have that platform where I can do events like this and have my free speech.
[00:51:35.814 --> 00:51:38.615]  But it's only possible with your support at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:51:38.635 --> 00:51:54.561]  So folks, whether it's a Space Force t-shirt limited edition, whether it's the nascent iodine life-changing survival shield X2, whether it's the bodies for soreness and inflammation after physical activity, or if you just have achy joints, it's all at InfoWarsTore.com and it literally funds this.
[00:51:54.581 --> 00:51:58.962]  I mean it literally funded my flight here, our rent-a-car, I mean all of it.
[00:51:59.042 --> 00:52:01.323]  It's going to fund the car to get to Pennsylvania and
[00:52:01.563 --> 00:52:25.219]  We're building an independent true media organization that the globalists fear and we're the model of what will bring down the globalists and that's why we're so critical and we've got the armored vehicle which doesn't just protect us from antifas we can pull into crowds of them then whenever we show up it dominates the news and so then what we're talking about dominates the news and it's another way to pull these stunts
[00:52:25.959 --> 00:52:27.499]  And we've done it with helicopters.
[00:52:27.519 --> 00:52:28.480]  We've done it with aircraft.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:33.661]  We're going to be projecting lasers legally up on walls with big messages this year.
[00:52:34.181 --> 00:52:35.261]  329 days out.
[00:52:36.201 --> 00:52:43.903]  I am putting my house on the market so I can sell my house to expand and hire some more crew through 2020.
[00:52:44.023 --> 00:52:45.564]  And that's great.
[00:52:45.664 --> 00:52:46.264]  I want to do that.
[00:52:46.284 --> 00:52:48.764]  That's why I always did that to have backup money.
[00:52:49.285 --> 00:52:51.805]  This is the total commitment, the big fight.
[00:52:52.325 --> 00:52:52.805]  It's on.
[00:52:52.845 --> 00:52:55.166]  There's no future if we don't defeat these globalists.
[00:52:55.486 --> 00:52:56.667]  It's easy to do what we're doing.
[00:52:57.047 --> 00:53:02.091]  It's easy to take action because laying down and taking it is the worst thing on earth.
[00:53:02.432 --> 00:53:05.534]  Getting on our knees, sucking on Globalist Boots is impossible.
[00:53:05.935 --> 00:53:07.776]  People say, Alex, thanks for not selling out.
[00:53:08.116 --> 00:53:10.178]  I physically cannot do it.
[00:53:10.759 --> 00:53:11.499]  You understand, folks?
[00:53:11.759 --> 00:53:12.560]  Owen can't stop.
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:15.222]  I was out working again until 10 o'clock last night.
[00:53:15.683 --> 00:53:16.503]  So was Robb Due.
[00:53:16.823 --> 00:53:17.744]  We love it.
[00:53:18.085 --> 00:53:18.285]  Owen.
[00:53:19.586 --> 00:53:23.909]  Well, and Alex, I don't even know if you've seen it, but last night we arrived in D.C.
[00:53:25.194 --> 00:53:28.155]  Uh, somewhere around midnight, and I confronted Congressman Al Green!
[00:53:28.656 --> 00:53:35.919]  And he literally stirred up an entire crowd of people at the airport, incited a whole crowd of people at the airport against me, calling me a racist!
[00:53:36.399 --> 00:53:38.180]  Literally calling me a racist for five minutes!
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.581]  I have the whole thing on tape, so, we're relentless!
[00:53:40.861 --> 00:53:41.862]  And if people are asking...
[00:53:42.182 --> 00:53:43.383]  How can you take action?
[00:53:43.683 --> 00:53:44.844]  We're showing you the model.
[00:53:45.124 --> 00:53:50.709]  I don't expect people to go out there and be Owen Schroer showing up at every event with their loud, obnoxious, pompous-ass voice.
[00:53:51.009 --> 00:53:52.050]  But you can do something.
[00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:53.471]  You can do something locally.
[00:53:53.691 --> 00:53:56.093]  You can travel and do something maybe once a year.
[00:53:56.373 --> 00:53:59.516]  By the way, you keep running into Al Green because he comes from Houston.
[00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:00.296]  You're from Austin.
[00:54:00.316 --> 00:54:01.617]  You keep running into him at the DC...
[00:54:02.518 --> 00:54:04.878]  But the sad thing is Alex, Al Green is a congressman.
[00:54:04.898 --> 00:54:07.799]  And he sounds exactly like some low IQ Trump protester out on the streets of a Trump rally.
[00:54:07.819 --> 00:54:08.839]  And this is a congressman!
[00:54:28.177 --> 00:54:30.498]  I mean, this is how far our Congress has fallen.
[00:54:30.538 --> 00:54:31.378]  These are our leaders?
[00:54:31.798 --> 00:54:34.520]  Nitwits and low IQs like Jerry Nadler and Al Green?
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:35.740]  I happen to like Al Green.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.201]  I like the fact he talks to me.
[00:54:37.601 --> 00:54:42.883]  But is he really that immature and low IQ that he just discounts what I'm saying to him by calling me a racist?
[00:54:43.243 --> 00:54:44.764]  That's pretty sad if that's the case.
[00:54:45.024 --> 00:54:45.624]  And if not...
[00:54:46.184 --> 00:54:54.214]  If these people are actively and consciously engaging in these lies, in this treason, in this sedition, then folks, we're dealing with a whole other issue.
[00:54:54.294 --> 00:54:56.857]  And if you don't take action, well, you know what's going to happen.
[00:54:56.877 --> 00:54:57.758]  You won't have America.
[00:54:57.798 --> 00:54:58.699]  You won't have freedom anymore.
[00:54:58.719 --> 00:54:58.999]  That's right.
[00:54:59.039 --> 00:55:00.221]  Now's the time to take action.
[00:55:00.261 --> 00:55:01.102]  We salute you, Owen.
[00:55:01.122 --> 00:55:01.462]  Stay there.
[00:55:01.482 --> 00:55:02.103]  I'm going to say bye to you.
[00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:14.278]  You notice that they're all wearing American flag pins now, and American flag style ties, and we love the Constitution, and we love America, and we're the moral authority.
[00:55:14.638 --> 00:55:20.022]  And as a Catholic, I resent your using the word hate in a sentence that addresses me.
[00:55:20.423 --> 00:55:21.504]  I don't hate anyone.
[00:55:21.824 --> 00:55:27.028]  I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love, and always prayed for the President.
[00:55:27.288 --> 00:55:28.789]  And I still pray for the President.
[00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:30.791]  I pray for the President all the time.
[00:55:31.511 --> 00:55:34.952]  So don't mess with me when it comes to words like that.
[00:55:35.593 --> 00:55:46.236]  This is the Democrats that want God out of the schools and have done it, that want to abort babies, want to keep them alive, want to kill old people with euthanasia, the case for killing granny.
[00:55:46.557 --> 00:55:52.879]  These are the people that are allowing NAMBLA to go have events with children unannounced in public schools in many cases.
[00:55:53.539 --> 00:56:04.353]  Convicted child rapist running it, and we're told that, oh, the void, I see this all over the news, the void once filled by evangelicals, that's a new talking point, and Christians, is now filled by the Democrats.
[00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:09.794]  Mike, it seems to me that Nancy Pelosi is doing a lot more than serving as Speaker of the House.
[00:56:09.834 --> 00:56:10.895]  She's filling a void.
[00:56:11.015 --> 00:56:15.259]  A leadership void and a moral void in this country.
[00:56:15.319 --> 00:56:18.342]  By the way, a moral void that evangelicals used to fill?
[00:56:18.442 --> 00:56:18.882]  That's right.
[00:56:18.902 --> 00:56:21.144]  A moral void now that they do not fill?
[00:56:21.364 --> 00:56:26.549]  You're like, well, Jerry Nadler, an America hater, just because he wore a red, white, and blue tie the other day doesn't mean that.
[00:56:26.689 --> 00:56:27.370]  He loves the country.
[00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:29.571]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[00:56:29.631 --> 00:56:30.652]  America was never great.
[00:56:30.792 --> 00:56:31.753]  It's never going to be that great.
[00:56:31.893 --> 00:56:32.214]  Cuomo.
[00:56:32.614 --> 00:56:34.736]  We're not going to make America great again.
[00:56:35.717 --> 00:56:36.717]  It was never that great.
[00:56:39.019 --> 00:56:39.880]  All of them say that.
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:40.721]  All of them do that.
[00:56:40.761 --> 00:56:41.741]  They've sold the country out.
[00:56:41.761 --> 00:56:42.442]  They're globalists.
[00:56:42.682 --> 00:56:49.067]  But now they're going to protect America in due process from that foreign Russian agent.
[00:56:49.247 --> 00:56:49.528]  Oops!
[00:56:50.488 --> 00:56:51.209]  Record skips.
[00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:54.372]  I mean Ukrainian agent.
[00:56:54.952 --> 00:56:55.732]  Donald Trump.
[00:56:56.173 --> 00:56:57.413]  People are like, this doesn't make any sense.
[00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:58.534]  They don't care.
[00:56:59.014 --> 00:57:03.257]  They just want a spectacle to legitimize their attempt to remove the president.
[00:57:03.317 --> 00:57:05.158]  People say, well, they didn't get him on Russiagate.
[00:57:05.198 --> 00:57:06.198]  They're not going to get him on this.
[00:57:06.378 --> 00:57:12.042]  They're getting him by distracting and diverting and not getting in trouble themselves by changing the subject.
[00:57:12.162 --> 00:57:14.623]  And they say, we don't want this impeachment.
[00:57:15.043 --> 00:57:18.245]  But it's with great moral authority we have to.
[00:57:18.305 --> 00:57:21.987]  It's the right thing for America.
[00:57:22.588 --> 00:57:23.048]  Sadly.
[00:57:24.693 --> 00:57:26.314]  I do not wish this moment on the country.
[00:57:26.334 --> 00:57:29.617]  It is not a pleasant task that we undertake today.
[00:57:29.657 --> 00:57:33.840]  But we have each taken an oath to protect the Constitution.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:35.501]  And the facts before us are clear.
[00:57:50.854 --> 00:57:58.120]  The Speaker of the House instructed House Committee Chairs to begin drafting articles of impeachment against the President of the United States.
[00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:04.365]  That is a very solemn duty and solemn undertaking.
[00:58:04.645 --> 00:58:07.948]  Meanwhile, the day Trump got elected, impeachment begins now.
[00:58:07.988 --> 00:58:08.609]  We'll get him.
[00:58:08.869 --> 00:58:10.290]  Oh, the insurance policy.
[00:58:10.871 --> 00:58:11.951]  The coup starts now.
[00:58:12.512 --> 00:58:14.534]  But now they're, this is very solemn.
[00:58:15.919 --> 00:58:17.240]  Reporters like, do you hate Trump?
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.301]  How dare you say that?
[00:58:19.341 --> 00:58:20.082]  I'm a Christian.
[00:58:20.242 --> 00:58:21.262]  I love everyone.
[00:58:22.023 --> 00:58:24.304]  I am your moral authority.
[00:58:25.965 --> 00:58:38.754]  I run the capital of baby parts sales, San Francisco, where we arrest investigative reporters that expose that we keep babies alive and deliver them with their hearts still beating to be dissected in medical experiments.
[00:58:39.174 --> 00:58:40.475]  I'm Nancy Pelosi.
[00:58:56.225 --> 00:58:59.887]  Ladies and gentlemen, the IG report just dropped.
[00:59:00.367 --> 00:59:02.028]  That's why I was running that special report.
[00:59:02.948 --> 00:59:04.849]  I'm going to play a few more minutes of important information.
[00:59:04.869 --> 00:59:05.850]  I'm going to come back from break.
[00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:06.991]  I'm reading it right now.
[00:59:10.132 --> 00:59:10.913]  So I'm out of breath.
[00:59:10.973 --> 00:59:12.514]  I've just been running back and forth from my office.
[00:59:12.574 --> 00:59:13.694]  So we're going to
[00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:23.594]  Go to this report and then we're going to come back on the other side and we'll get into the Inspector General report and so much more that's happening today.
[00:59:23.634 --> 00:59:30.877]  And then they're calling for the arrest and imprisonment all over the place of anybody that refuses vaccines, which is so amazing and so criminal.
[00:59:30.917 --> 00:59:32.878]  This is secret testing on the public, is what it is.
[00:59:33.998 --> 00:59:35.278]  That's all coming up as well.
[00:59:35.318 --> 00:59:37.579]  There is just so much we're going to be doing today.
[00:59:37.599 --> 00:59:41.001]  We'll also open the phones up and get your take on all of this.
[00:59:43.203 --> 00:59:47.084]  Let's look at the mainstream media, though, that really wants to shut down your voice.
[00:59:51.265 --> 00:59:55.226]  Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:59:55.486 --> 00:59:56.606]  I am now completely banned.
[00:59:56.646 --> 01:00:00.707]  Now InfoWars, of course, is that web show and website led by rageaholic Alex Jones.
[01:00:00.987 --> 01:00:02.028]  I want them shut down.
[01:00:02.068 --> 01:00:02.988]  I want them silenced.
[01:00:03.028 --> 01:00:03.828]  I want them muted.
[01:00:03.868 --> 01:00:05.689]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:00:05.749 --> 01:00:07.249]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[01:00:07.629 --> 01:00:13.475]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[01:00:13.575 --> 01:00:20.501]  These are very extreme individuals and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[01:00:20.581 --> 01:00:24.305]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous, is what Facebook is saying.
[01:00:24.605 --> 01:00:27.608]  Those individuals include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.928 --> 01:00:30.111]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them.
[01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:32.533]  It's not that hard to figure out.
[01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:49.612]  No!
[01:00:49.952 --> 01:00:53.735]  Because big tech is only interested in going after conservatives.
[01:00:53.755 --> 01:00:55.076]  You know, the really dangerous ones.
[01:00:55.136 --> 01:00:58.298]  Dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[01:00:58.418 --> 01:01:00.960]  President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:03.462]  And a brief video by InfoWars' Millie Weaver.
[01:01:03.502 --> 01:01:07.565]  Social media's hall monitor, Frank Stelter, was not very happy about it.
[01:01:07.605 --> 01:01:10.787]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as InfoWars.
[01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:13.248]  Back to your point, though, about the InfoWars presidency.
[01:01:13.869 --> 01:01:20.372]  I want to know, and I tweeted this the other day, what is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[01:01:20.772 --> 01:01:22.954]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[01:01:23.514 --> 01:01:25.815]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.136]  I want them shut down.
[01:01:27.196 --> 01:01:28.116]  I want them silenced.
[01:01:28.156 --> 01:01:28.837]  I want them muted.
[01:01:28.857 --> 01:01:30.818]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:32.299]  I want them shut down!
[01:01:32.319 --> 01:01:33.840]  I want them silenced!
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.660]  I want them muted!
[01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:35.801]  Don't worry.
[01:01:36.381 --> 01:01:38.082]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[01:01:40.606 --> 01:01:47.248]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, it's a 500-page report and it's printing right now.
[01:01:47.408 --> 01:01:54.110]  DOJ Inspector General releases report on FBI conduct, finds clear abuse of FISA process.
[01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:57.271]  It's posted up on Infowars.com.
[01:01:58.631 --> 01:02:00.531]  Obviously, ZeroHedge.com has posted it.
[01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:03.892]  DrugReport.com has got it posted as well.
[01:02:04.552 --> 01:02:06.533]  USS Department Inspector General finds
[01:02:07.654 --> 01:02:11.679]  Opening of FBI probe into Trump campaign advisers was legitimate.
[01:02:11.739 --> 01:02:12.820]  We told you that was coming.
[01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:14.542]  Told you!
[01:02:16.944 --> 01:02:19.367]  Properly authorized congressional source.
[01:02:21.249 --> 01:02:22.170]  And then it goes on.
[01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:28.978]  FBI overstated its confidence in Steele's reliability past contributing to the FBI investigation.
[01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:33.890]  The evidence produced by the investigation was consistently exculpatory.
[01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:40.016]  Nevertheless, investigation surveillance was pushed towards the duration of the campaign and even the president's administration.
[01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:43.040]  So everything was showing Trump was innocent, but they didn't care.
[01:02:44.281 --> 01:02:48.145]  The first FISA application drew heavily upon
[01:02:49.502 --> 01:02:56.726]  Not entirely upon reporting to support the government's position that Page was an agent of a foreign power, which of course he wasn't.
[01:02:57.386 --> 01:03:04.470]  So yeah, it's what we've known for years, what we told you two years ago from the courts, Inspector General, that it was all based on a lie.
[01:03:05.331 --> 01:03:07.652]  But they whitewashed it like we told you they would.
[01:03:08.193 --> 01:03:08.653]  We told you!
[01:03:14.011 --> 01:03:16.794]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[01:03:16.914 --> 01:03:17.975]  Let me think, just let me think.
[01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:23.520]  I suspect even now orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:24.181]  It's Chancellor Suttler.
[01:03:24.902 --> 01:03:25.322]  Damn it!
[01:03:25.342 --> 01:03:25.402]  Why?
[01:03:26.658 --> 01:03:32.680]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:38.981]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:44.003]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[01:03:44.043 --> 01:03:45.003]  You decided, sir.
[01:03:45.063 --> 01:03:45.983]  You wanted it foolproof.
[01:03:46.003 --> 01:03:47.404]  You told me every television in London!
[01:03:47.664 --> 01:03:51.145]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[01:03:51.565 --> 01:03:55.266]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit,
[01:03:55.846 --> 01:04:00.950]  You now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:01.351]  Cameras.
[01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:02.091]  We need cameras.
[01:04:02.392 --> 01:04:03.132]  How did this happen?
[01:04:03.833 --> 01:04:04.693]  Who's to blame?
[01:04:05.574 --> 01:04:08.276]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:04:08.296 --> 01:04:10.258]  They will be held accountable.
[01:04:10.618 --> 01:04:16.063]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:04:17.262 --> 01:04:18.803]  I know why you did it.
[01:04:19.244 --> 01:04:20.304]  I know you were afraid.
[01:04:20.745 --> 01:04:22.446]  Who wouldn't be?
[01:04:22.466 --> 01:04:22.526]  War?
[01:04:22.746 --> 01:04:23.127]  Terror?
[01:04:23.367 --> 01:04:24.027]  Disease?
[01:04:24.668 --> 01:04:30.512]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:04:31.113 --> 01:04:36.877]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[01:04:37.518 --> 01:04:43.682]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:04:50.382 --> 01:04:51.602]  There is a war.
[01:04:52.083 --> 01:04:53.063]  It's happening now.
[01:04:53.943 --> 01:04:55.744]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:04:56.324 --> 01:04:58.124]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:04:58.885 --> 01:05:00.365]  We are the resistance.
[01:05:00.805 --> 01:05:03.026]  We are the Infowar.
[01:05:09.248 --> 01:05:10.208]  Well, we told you.
[01:05:12.249 --> 01:05:16.250]  We kept hearing from Fox News that every two weeks,
[01:05:18.203 --> 01:05:29.965]  That in another two weeks, we're going to get the Inspector General report, and then it's going to call for all these indictments, and it's going to say it was all criminal, and Obama and Hillary Clinton ran it.
[01:05:35.126 --> 01:05:41.347]  And now we have the Inspector General report, and it does exactly what I predicted it would.
[01:05:43.247 --> 01:05:45.908]  It says a couple of low-level FBI agents and people
[01:05:46.971 --> 01:05:48.272]  Didn't follow procedures.
[01:05:49.532 --> 01:05:51.774]  You know, like washing your hands after you go to the bathroom.
[01:05:53.735 --> 01:05:55.396]  Or looking both ways when you cross the street.
[01:05:56.977 --> 01:06:00.439]  But that the investigation was legitimate when it was opened.
[01:06:04.201 --> 01:06:05.642]  And they've exonerated these criminals.
[01:06:05.722 --> 01:06:06.422]  So there it is.
[01:06:06.522 --> 01:06:14.927]  DOJ IG report finds Russia probe wasn't politically motivated, but separate from serious performance failures.
[01:06:16.175 --> 01:06:21.738]  Oh, it was all just a big mess-up, those illegal warrants and lying to Congress and the spying.
[01:06:21.838 --> 01:06:24.980]  FBI Director Wray's Response to Inspector General Report.
[01:06:26.761 --> 01:06:30.202]  The report enclosed the FBI crossfire hurricane investigation.
[01:06:30.222 --> 01:06:31.943]  They later said it didn't exist.
[01:06:31.963 --> 01:06:33.264]  Remember a few years ago that I made that up?
[01:06:33.844 --> 01:06:41.048]  And related investigations of certain individuals were opened in 2016 for an authorized purpose and with adequate factual
[01:06:42.585 --> 01:06:43.666]  We're good to go.
[01:07:04.963 --> 01:07:06.544]  country expects of the FBI.
[01:07:06.584 --> 01:07:15.772]  We are vested with significant authorities and it is our obligation as public servants to ensure that these authorities are exercised with objectivity and integrity.
[01:07:16.072 --> 01:07:19.194]  Anything less falls short of the FBI's duty to the American people.
[01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:31.064]  So you shouldn't talk about insurance policies and Hillary's gonna win by a million points and all the rest of it and we're digging through it right now but it's it's already what we knew they already got us ready for it.
[01:07:32.325 --> 01:07:33.406]  It's not what
[01:07:34.264 --> 01:07:40.588]  Mysterious 8 Chan boards told us that they, millions of indictments, everybody's going to prison, trust the plan.
[01:07:40.608 --> 01:07:44.311]  You know, by the end of 2017, they'll all be arrested.
[01:07:46.352 --> 01:07:48.314]  Sessions is the greatest guy since sliced bread.
[01:07:51.135 --> 01:07:55.238]  And you see, trust the plan, hope and change.
[01:07:56.839 --> 01:07:57.280]  Well, guess what?
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.200]  We are the plan.
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.442]  Our audience of activists, we got Trump elected.
[01:08:01.974 --> 01:08:03.795]  We've exposed globalism and world government.
[01:08:04.415 --> 01:08:05.535]  We're taking action.
[01:08:05.675 --> 01:08:06.715]  We're moving forward.
[01:08:08.676 --> 01:08:09.956]  And we're not going to back down.
[01:08:10.216 --> 01:08:11.417]  We're not going to take it lying down.
[01:08:11.437 --> 01:08:27.022]  I know when Troyer did, what many Americans know they need to do, and that's go into Congress and these fake impeachment hearings that have been done illegally that are the crime, and said you're the traitors, you're the criminals bringing down America, trying to sabotage our economy, our border, our sovereignty.
[01:08:28.522 --> 01:08:31.203]  Because you're not going to get it out of the swamp appointed by Bush Sr.
[01:08:33.663 --> 01:08:43.608]  Two terms of the Clintons, two terms of Bush, and two terms of Barack Obama.
[01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:46.630]  You know, that's a lot of years.
[01:08:48.931 --> 01:08:52.814]  That's 20, what is it, 28, 29 years of just since the Clintons.
[01:08:56.781 --> 01:09:04.326]  And you add George W. on, we're up there at 30-something years of having really bad, evil people in there, bringing their people in.
[01:09:06.767 --> 01:09:12.271]  And selling the nation out and engaging in illegal spying and just oppression of the people.
[01:09:14.152 --> 01:09:16.534]  And now the demonization of America even existing.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:28.421]  And now we're going to see all the anonymous groups tell us go to sleep, lay down, don't hit the streets.
[01:09:29.742 --> 01:09:30.542]  Trump's going to win.
[01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:31.482]  Trump's invincible.
[01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:32.303]  Trust the plan.
[01:09:32.863 --> 01:09:34.183]  As we one go, we all go.
[01:09:40.745 --> 01:09:43.406]  And Trump saying, you know, oh no, Sessions is horrible.
[01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:44.526]  And no, these people are horrible.
[01:09:45.606 --> 01:09:48.328]  This is treason, and this is crazy, and the Justice Department needs to take action.
[01:09:48.909 --> 01:09:51.792]  But the anonymous groups go, oh, that's all a cover, everything's fine.
[01:09:52.132 --> 01:09:53.653]  The President's sneaking up on them.
[01:09:56.436 --> 01:09:58.377]  No, we're the ones getting snuck up on.
[01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:07.826]  And watching election meddling take place, and voter suppression, and the President with 328 days in change left.
[01:10:07.846 --> 01:10:08.226]  It's 329 today.
[01:10:14.511 --> 01:10:19.192]  Now needs to understand just how out of control all of this is, and of course the system's going to protect itself.
[01:10:19.692 --> 01:10:28.174]  And they're going to move ahead with their fake impeachment, all done illegally, and they're going to go to the Senate, and this signals weakness of the President.
[01:10:29.974 --> 01:10:35.496]  Now we've got this report up on Infowars.com that's so important, and I agree with Michael Snyder.
[01:10:36.156 --> 01:10:41.097]  Only 19 senators are a firm no against impeachment.
[01:10:42.179 --> 01:10:44.661]  And there are whispers some Republicans may turn on Trump.
[01:10:44.681 --> 01:10:49.266]  Then it goes into their statements and the type of blackmail and arm-twisting and payoffs that are going on.
[01:10:49.566 --> 01:10:52.869]  You don't know the pressure they'll put you under.
[01:10:54.231 --> 01:10:56.373]  Believe me, I've been through it and have not wavered.
[01:10:59.991 --> 01:11:12.101]  But the system wants you to believe everything's fine, Trump is invincible, you don't need to rally, or march, or make a phone call, or call Congress, or spread a Trump campaign video, because everything's fine!
[01:11:15.944 --> 01:11:17.986]  When everything's not fine, you see this?
[01:11:20.588 --> 01:11:24.010]  Every couple hours I get another article like this, and I've got three daughters.
[01:11:25.391 --> 01:11:29.515]  Two of them have friends that go to public school, they go to events, they go to it all, and I get to hear about it.
[01:11:31.135 --> 01:11:39.962]  Every class they're taught how to be quote homosexuals, how great it is, how the family's bad.
[01:11:40.022 --> 01:11:40.943]  I mean, you all know about it.
[01:11:41.023 --> 01:11:46.988]  Three-year-olds are having sex changes done at John Hopkins in the United States as if they could make a decision.
[01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:52.913]  Six-year-old children told to write gay love letters to promote diversity.
[01:11:52.993 --> 01:11:53.954]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:11:56.448 --> 01:11:57.709]  You can't stop progress!
[01:11:58.329 --> 01:12:05.712]  And what did the school in Texas say when the, quote, drag queen, a man dressed as a clown, had children sit on his lap without telling the parents in elementary school last week?
[01:12:07.132 --> 01:12:10.494]  The teacher and others and the principal defended it and said, parents don't know best.
[01:12:10.834 --> 01:12:12.015]  We're doing this, period.
[01:12:12.135 --> 01:12:12.695]  Get used to it.
[01:12:12.715 --> 01:12:13.315]  Those were quotes.
[01:12:14.856 --> 01:12:22.419]  A video posted by BBC shows six-year-old primary school children being told they need to write gay love letters to promote diversity.
[01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:24.500]  The clip features kids from
[01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:35.600]  Boozy Lodge Primary School imagining themselves in the role of Prince Henry who wants to profess his love for a gay man and marry his servant Thomas.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.361]  The school teaches children about LGBT relationships from an early age.
[01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:43.383]  We'll get the video of that and play that for you coming up.
[01:12:45.264 --> 01:12:49.166]  But the real attacks are the GMO and the vaccines and the hidden weapon systems in those.
[01:12:49.566 --> 01:12:53.628]  But I want to open the phones up first to give all of you a chance to respond to the
[01:12:54.943 --> 01:12:56.004]  Inspector General report.
[01:12:56.484 --> 01:12:58.225]  Prepare to hear Q say it's a win.
[01:12:59.206 --> 01:13:00.267]  You're Prince Henry.
[01:13:01.368 --> 01:13:05.471]  You're going to tell Thomas Whyte it's a brilliant idea for him to marry you.
[01:13:25.683 --> 01:13:27.204]  This is the greatest level.
[01:13:27.224 --> 01:13:28.564]  Look at that cult leader.
[01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:29.404]  She's gonna make you accept Islam.
[01:13:29.424 --> 01:13:31.445]  She's gonna make you accept writing love letters to the same sex.
[01:13:31.485 --> 01:13:33.706]  These children shouldn't be made to write love letters to anybody.
[01:13:33.746 --> 01:13:36.427]  This is sexualization of children at point-blank range.
[01:13:54.189 --> 01:13:57.171]  But it's the left's lie ruining the innocence.
[01:13:57.712 --> 01:14:06.719]  The plan is to reduce population so a large number of people don't have same sex or different sex relationships that then produce offspring.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:08.621]  That's in my film, Endgame.
[01:14:08.701 --> 01:14:09.842]  It's in the government documents.
[01:14:09.942 --> 01:14:10.582]  It's the plan.
[01:14:11.843 --> 01:14:13.365]  How do you get people to sterilize themselves?
[01:14:13.445 --> 01:14:14.626]  Call it transgenderism.
[01:14:16.616 --> 01:14:23.061]  And it comes to you from liars like Pocahontas that told you she was a Native American when she knew she wasn't a Native American.
[01:14:23.681 --> 01:14:26.143]  And now she tries to backtrack and says she shouldn't do that.
[01:14:26.223 --> 01:14:26.684]  Here she is.
[01:14:26.704 --> 01:14:36.151]  I grew up in Oklahoma, and my three older brothers and I learned about our family, same way most people do, from our mom and from our dad.
[01:14:37.231 --> 01:14:43.176]  My family's very important to me, and that's why many years ago,
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.022]  I sometimes identified as Native American.
[01:14:47.163 --> 01:14:52.306]  Boston Globe did a big investigation about this, gosh, about a year and a half ago.
[01:14:52.727 --> 01:14:56.309]  Never had anything to do with any job I ever got or any benefit.
[01:14:58.371 --> 01:15:01.313]  But even so, I shouldn't have done it.
[01:15:02.234 --> 01:15:02.934]  That's another lie.
[01:15:02.974 --> 01:15:04.335]  She got into law school on it.
[01:15:04.395 --> 01:15:05.536]  It was on her bar card.
[01:15:06.337 --> 01:15:07.698]  That's how she did all of that.
[01:15:07.758 --> 01:15:09.959]  She's a complete and total liar.
[01:15:10.765 --> 01:15:17.831]  Like these white men and white women that say they're black and dye their skin and frizz their hair to get tuition and all the rest of it.
[01:15:18.671 --> 01:15:19.292]  It's ridiculous.
[01:15:19.312 --> 01:15:22.775]  But again, that's who's telling us they're going to sexualize our children.
[01:15:23.235 --> 01:15:30.941]  And CNN's got headlines, man who had baby loses right in court to be called father on birth certificate.
[01:15:31.121 --> 01:15:32.062]  Because it's not true.
[01:15:32.342 --> 01:15:37.086]  You're a woman that calls herself a man that has a vagina and a uterus and had a baby.
[01:15:39.059 --> 01:15:42.963]  Look, this is how they're gonna get around the laws against pedophilia and the rest of it.
[01:15:43.724 --> 01:15:45.525]  You see Brian Williams, he's back on the niche.
[01:15:47.467 --> 01:15:51.111]  He's all over the place as the man telling us Trump's a traitor and impeachment's needed.
[01:15:51.371 --> 01:15:53.573]  Remember when he lied about being shot down by the helicopter?
[01:15:53.593 --> 01:15:55.175]  Or being shot down in the helicopter?
[01:15:58.359 --> 01:16:02.683]  I said I was traveling in an aircraft that was hit by RPG fire.
[01:16:03.143 --> 01:16:05.966]  I was instead in a following aircraft.
[01:16:06.387 --> 01:16:13.875]  We all landed after the ground fire incident and spent two harrowing nights in a sandstorm in the Iraq desert.
[01:16:14.395 --> 01:16:24.747]  This was a bungled attempt by me to thank one special veteran, and by extension, our brave military men and women, veterans everywhere, those who have served while I did not.
[01:16:25.227 --> 01:16:30.213]  I hope they know they have my greatest respect, and also now, my apology.
[01:16:30.614 --> 01:16:32.095]  When we come back here tonight...
[01:16:32.876 --> 01:16:38.440]  And then of course he had to change the story later and admit that there were no helicopters, there was no sandstorm.
[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:42.242]  Just like Hillary said she got shot at landing in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
[01:16:42.282 --> 01:16:43.363]  This is what they do.
[01:16:43.683 --> 01:16:44.404]  We already know that.
[01:16:46.665 --> 01:16:51.108]  And I know everybody wants to hear positive news.
[01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:53.411]  But I refuse to lie to you.
[01:16:54.091 --> 01:16:58.853]  The positive news is globalism is corrupt and evil and unpopular if we expose it and fight it.
[01:16:58.953 --> 01:17:02.214]  And if we promote populism and freedom and Americana, people will choose it.
[01:17:02.814 --> 01:17:06.616]  The good news is a lot of people are awake and involved in every race, color, and creed and want freedom.
[01:17:07.536 --> 01:17:11.198]  The bad news is most people don't actually want to roll their sleeves up.
[01:17:12.699 --> 01:17:15.060]  They think the animating contest of liberty is something that's bad.
[01:17:17.901 --> 01:17:20.222]  And so they want to just believe propaganda
[01:17:21.138 --> 01:17:33.084]  That I've seen for 25 years, on air, about white knights, and don't worry, imaginary groups are gonna handle it all, and ooh, every bad thing that goes on is really just a cover story for something really good that's about to happen.
[01:17:36.366 --> 01:17:43.050]  And you've heard from all these groups and organizations that trust the plan, as one goes, we all go, all this crazy cult crap.
[01:17:45.285 --> 01:17:49.948]  And that this IG report was going to have all the indictments and that, you know, Durham's coming and all this.
[01:17:50.188 --> 01:17:55.491]  And yes, you might see Strzok or Page indicted.
[01:17:56.232 --> 01:18:01.015]  And there have been indictments, not thousands of them, but there have been indictments out there that have gotten shut down.
[01:18:01.035 --> 01:18:04.177]  Because the Justice Department has that power.
[01:18:06.798 --> 01:18:07.379]  And it's wrong.
[01:18:07.859 --> 01:18:09.100]  So the IG report's out.
[01:18:10.387 --> 01:18:14.908]  And it's everything that was in the Inspector General of the Courts report two years ago that we broke that got zero coverage.
[01:18:15.588 --> 01:18:19.389]  The courts came out and said we were given false info to do this to the Trump campaign.
[01:18:19.409 --> 01:18:21.529]  It was wrong and it continued on into his administration.
[01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:23.529]  And Admiral Rogers went and told Trump that.
[01:18:23.849 --> 01:18:31.191]  And we told you how they were spying specifically and I can play you all the CNN clips saying I'm a liar and made it up and nobody was spying on Trump.
[01:18:31.431 --> 01:18:32.351]  Remember all that?
[01:18:33.051 --> 01:18:35.451]  Remember congressional hearings saying shut us down?
[01:18:35.851 --> 01:18:36.492]  Arrest us?
[01:18:37.132 --> 01:18:38.012]  Just last week?
[01:18:38.312 --> 01:18:38.852]  Two weeks ago?
[01:18:41.032 --> 01:18:42.753]  Because we're real, folks.
[01:18:44.975 --> 01:18:46.457]  And we'll tell you like it really is.
[01:18:48.418 --> 01:19:02.130]  Owen did a great job this morning spontaneously standing up to the globalists and pointing out the treason of this illegal impeachment operation that's been carried out in an unconstitutional way, making the whole thing a fraud, even according to constitutional liberal lawyers like Jonathan Turley, the professor.
[01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:04.653]  But the IG report dropped.
[01:19:05.737 --> 01:19:10.642]  And Owen had predicted, exactly as I had, that they'd say, well, no official FBI malfeasance.
[01:19:10.682 --> 01:19:15.066]  It was a good investigation that was open, but a few people didn't follow policies and procedures right.
[01:19:15.106 --> 01:19:20.992]  And Barr will spin it back and say, well, it does show that they were spying on him for political purposes, but the report doesn't say that.
[01:19:21.012 --> 01:19:23.475]  So, exactly what we said happened.
[01:19:23.955 --> 01:19:26.738]  So, we're the bad guys again for being dead on, Owen Schroeder.
[01:19:26.758 --> 01:19:27.419]  What do you want to say to that?
[01:19:29.252 --> 01:19:32.814]  Well, it's the swamp winning again, Alex, is really what it is.
[01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:38.716]  I mean, we know who the Inspector General Horowitz was, came from the Obama administration.
[01:19:39.157 --> 01:19:43.419]  We know who William Barr is, he came from the Bush administration.
[01:19:44.519 --> 01:19:46.320]  That's about as swampy as it gets.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.161]  Now, I still had some hope.
[01:19:49.021 --> 01:19:50.702]  I wanted to, and I still don't want to
[01:19:51.257 --> 01:19:54.438]  Nothing matters if you don't take action.
[01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:56.038]  Horwitz is not going to save America.
[01:19:56.058 --> 01:19:58.219]  Bill Barr is not going to save America.
[01:19:58.279 --> 01:20:00.100]  John Durham is not going to save America.
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.581]  And he sure as hell shook them up!
[01:20:17.601 --> 01:20:21.183]  He shook them up, but all he did was get them off their asses to organize against us.
[01:20:44.237 --> 01:20:48.298]  I mean, he can shake them up and keep shaking them, but they shouldn't be shaken up at all.
[01:20:48.339 --> 01:20:49.079]  They should be in jail.
[01:20:49.599 --> 01:20:50.599]  That's where they should be.
[01:20:50.639 --> 01:20:51.900]  In jail is where they should be.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.421]  So until they're in jail, nothing's going to change.
[01:20:54.461 --> 01:21:00.503]  And I don't know if Trump is that committed to this mission, to actually see these people arrested.
[01:21:02.705 --> 01:21:05.068]  I think the American people are just going to get more fed up, Alex.
[01:21:05.088 --> 01:21:07.591]  Well, they don't respect him because he doesn't come from government.
[01:21:08.111 --> 01:21:09.373]  And so they've paralyzed him.
[01:21:09.773 --> 01:21:10.814]  He's been wanting them indicted.
[01:21:10.854 --> 01:21:11.855]  He's been given the right orders.
[01:21:11.895 --> 01:21:12.376]  We know that.
[01:21:12.396 --> 01:21:14.498]  That's why they're so scared of him and coming for his throat.
[01:21:14.839 --> 01:21:16.240]  But he just doesn't have real men around him.
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:17.261]  He's got a bunch of damn cowards.
[01:21:20.347 --> 01:21:23.249]  And I think America is just reaching a point again, Alex.
[01:21:23.309 --> 01:21:25.190]  It's like the same thing with the impeachment scam.
[01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:26.251]  America's sick of it.
[01:21:26.511 --> 01:21:27.392]  They're sick of it.
[01:21:27.612 --> 01:21:29.333]  They've been through this for two years now.
[01:21:29.653 --> 01:21:30.274]  They're done.
[01:21:30.374 --> 01:21:30.994]  They're over it.
[01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:32.555]  They're sick of government corruption.
[01:21:32.575 --> 01:21:34.416]  They're sick of the two-tiered justice system.
[01:21:34.436 --> 01:21:47.465]  So, I mean, I think there's enough Americans, I mean, politically, you know, maybe it's a different measurement, but I think there's enough Americans that really genuinely and rightfully expected the IG report to wind up
[01:21:48.106 --> 01:21:48.947]  Well, you're right, Owen.
[01:22:17.318 --> 01:22:22.385]  The election fraud, the election meddling, what Big Tech's doing, Trump doing nothing has just greenlit all this.
[01:22:23.526 --> 01:22:27.431]  And we're just seeing things happen under Trump that if they were happening under Hillary, people wouldn't put up with.
[01:22:28.412 --> 01:22:30.114]  And it's all well, Trump's in there, so...
[01:22:31.641 --> 01:22:34.122]  It's a real dereliction of duty, and they're going to destroy him.
[01:22:34.202 --> 01:22:36.344]  They want to destroy him to discredit populism.
[01:22:36.844 --> 01:22:37.944]  Trump is a real president.
[01:22:38.025 --> 01:22:39.505]  He is trying to do the right thing.
[01:22:40.266 --> 01:22:45.969]  And he's being pro-life, and he's going after the pedophile rings, and he's trying to secure... He's done a lot of good things.
[01:22:46.029 --> 01:22:49.751]  He's blocking the UN, running our refugee program, and bringing in millions of those folks.
[01:22:49.791 --> 01:22:51.372]  So, I thank God for Trump every day, but...
[01:22:52.495 --> 01:22:54.657]  Letting these crimes continue on is just incredible.
[01:22:54.677 --> 01:22:55.957]  And some final comments from Elwynn Shroyer.
[01:22:55.977 --> 01:22:58.599]  We're going to open the phones up for first-time callers.
[01:22:58.719 --> 01:23:00.861]  Specifically, quick comments on the IG report.
[01:23:01.221 --> 01:23:03.142]  What do you think is coming next from the Durham report?
[01:23:03.763 --> 01:23:04.724]  You know more of the same.
[01:23:05.044 --> 01:23:05.464]  It's my view.
[01:23:05.484 --> 01:23:05.604]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:23:05.624 --> 01:23:05.664]  877-789-2539.
[01:23:05.684 --> 01:23:05.924]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:23:05.964 --> 01:23:06.705]  We'll be right back.
[01:23:15.103 --> 01:23:17.666]  Yeah, we got the Attorney General's statement here.
[01:23:17.686 --> 01:23:19.688]  That's exactly what I would expect.
[01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:23.192]  I'll read some of the next segment and go to your phone calls to get your take on this at 877-789-2539.
[01:23:23.212 --> 01:23:23.292]  877-789-2539.
[01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:27.036]  And I have this, all this vaccine news I want to get to, but because of this all breaking today,
[01:23:37.093 --> 01:23:43.136]  I'm either gonna shoot this live on air tomorrow or I'm gonna take time and do it like a PowerPoint presentation up here tonight.
[01:23:43.737 --> 01:23:46.018]  Go home and see my children some this afternoon, come back tonight.
[01:23:46.998 --> 01:23:49.400]  Because they're talking about arresting people that don't vaccinate now.
[01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:53.591]  And they're lying and saying there is no bad reactions.
[01:23:53.711 --> 01:23:55.191]  I mean, this is really dangerous.
[01:23:55.871 --> 01:23:57.951]  And it's about secret experimentation on the population.
[01:23:58.351 --> 01:24:03.012]  So I have all these folders, all these documents, all these admissions, big article up on Infowars.com.
[01:24:03.612 --> 01:24:10.914]  Everett Trump or Rick Wilson says put anti-vaxxers in concentration camps for re-education, take their children and their property.
[01:24:11.594 --> 01:24:16.995]  So they're coming to put something in your body that has liability protection, its own inserts, they can kill you.
[01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:20.652]  They're now not letting inserts be online.
[01:24:21.935 --> 01:24:22.936]  They don't want you to read an insert.
[01:24:23.517 --> 01:24:24.519]  You used to, they'd give them to you.
[01:24:24.539 --> 01:24:27.063]  We went down to Walgreens today to get fresh ones.
[01:24:28.065 --> 01:24:29.127]  They tried to not give them to us.
[01:24:30.730 --> 01:24:31.230]  Because they know.
[01:24:34.378 --> 01:24:40.163]  Because I've got a bunch of them that I already highlighted years ago, but I thought I'd get the new ones from different makers and highlight these for you, too.
[01:24:40.743 --> 01:24:44.646]  You've got to get a magnifying glass out on them, though, because they've made the print even smaller.
[01:24:44.666 --> 01:24:47.489]  You can have 2015 vision, you still can't read it.
[01:24:48.289 --> 01:24:49.610]  So, look for that.
[01:24:49.670 --> 01:24:51.292]  This is a real public service announcement.
[01:24:52.052 --> 01:24:53.353]  You wonder why the IQ is going down?
[01:24:53.393 --> 01:24:55.475]  You wonder why the life expectancy is plummeting straight down?
[01:24:56.636 --> 01:24:57.096]  They're doing it.
[01:24:57.136 --> 01:24:58.057]  It's a chemical lobotomy.
[01:24:58.438 --> 01:24:59.899]  Ode Schreuer, finishing up, my friend.
[01:24:59.919 --> 01:25:00.599]  You're there in D.C.
[01:25:00.619 --> 01:25:03.642]  You're going to Hershey, Pennsylvania for the big Trump rally tomorrow night.
[01:25:06.011 --> 01:25:11.214]  I mean, I gotta tell you, reading Barr's statement and others here, this is no action.
[01:25:11.234 --> 01:25:16.557]  This is the deep state protecting itself, and that's why they're so arrogant and why they're all still trying to remove the president right now.
[01:25:17.198 --> 01:25:18.238]  This is very dangerous.
[01:25:19.899 --> 01:25:21.800]  Here's what the president needs to realize, Alex.
[01:25:22.621 --> 01:25:32.947]  If he wants to be successful in his mission, he can't rely on Barr or Durham or Horwitz or, quite frankly, anybody from D.C.
[01:25:34.091 --> 01:25:35.612]  Anybody from the political class.
[01:25:35.672 --> 01:25:39.253]  The only people that Trump can rely on is his voters.
[01:25:39.753 --> 01:25:44.415]  The only people that Trump can rely on is his base and the American citizens.
[01:25:44.615 --> 01:25:47.156]  And, you know, I don't know Trump personally.
[01:25:47.436 --> 01:25:48.496]  I've never talked to Trump.
[01:25:48.696 --> 01:25:52.697]  So it's hard for me to get a gauge as far as his character and his psyche is concerned.
[01:25:53.618 --> 01:25:55.198]  But I wonder if he's realized that yet.
[01:25:56.059 --> 01:25:56.919]  And I wonder
[01:26:02.443 --> 01:26:05.326]  Owen's making some really great points, but start over.
[01:26:05.366 --> 01:26:06.107]  Your Skype was messing up.
[01:26:06.127 --> 01:26:06.767]  You said you wonder?
[01:26:06.787 --> 01:26:15.316]  Well, I just wonder if the president, or when the president, is going to cross the threshold and realize he can't rely on anybody from the swamp.
[01:26:15.356 --> 01:26:16.637]  It doesn't matter what they tell him.
[01:26:16.657 --> 01:26:20.641]  I think that's going to be in early November, in about 329 days, when he loses the election.
[01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:31.674]  And that's a whole separate issue with the Democrat election fraud that's going on right now.
[01:26:31.815 --> 01:26:35.237]  Yeah, I guess if he doesn't want to address that, then he's his own worst enemy.
[01:26:35.257 --> 01:26:37.919]  But you know, maybe we'll get a gauge, Alex.
[01:26:38.139 --> 01:26:43.664]  And I don't want to take too much stake into what Trump says at his rallies, because he says a lot.
[01:26:43.724 --> 01:26:50.909]  But maybe tomorrow at the rally, we can get a gauge on where President Trump is at as far as dealing with this.
[01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:54.152]  Because let me tell you, Alex, while Trump's
[01:26:54.878 --> 01:26:56.299]  Voting base is obviously loyal.
[01:27:00.021 --> 01:27:03.204]  While his base is obviously loyal, Skype problems again.
[01:27:03.664 --> 01:27:05.245]  Owen's really making some great points right now.
[01:27:05.265 --> 01:27:09.788]  While his base is loyal, they're not going to put up with lack of action like this.
[01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:14.051]  And it's just frightening to see the power of the swamp, but it wasn't going to be easy.
[01:27:14.071 --> 01:27:16.292]  You're saying his base is loyal, Owen, but?
[01:27:18.874 --> 01:27:22.877]  But I think that even his base is going to reach a point where they're so fed up, and
[01:27:25.627 --> 01:27:37.996]  I don't know if they'll turn their back on Trump per se, but that energy to get out and vote for Trump might not be there again.
[01:27:38.537 --> 01:27:40.598]  And so that's the big measurement right now.
[01:27:40.638 --> 01:27:48.564]  Now again, does it matter if they're committing blatant election rigging with electronic voting machines and illegal voting and no voter ID?
[01:27:50.302 --> 01:27:51.303]  The action has to be taken.
[01:27:51.323 --> 01:27:52.304]  We'll check in with you more.
[01:27:52.324 --> 01:27:55.889]  You'll be covering that live event tomorrow evening from the armored vehicle.
[01:27:56.609 --> 01:27:57.090]  Stay with us.
[01:27:59.593 --> 01:28:01.675]  Here is how the committee will proceed for this hearing.
[01:28:02.416 --> 01:28:07.102]  I will make an opening statement, and then I will recognize the ranking member for an opening statement.
[01:28:07.883 --> 01:28:10.306]  After that, we will hear two sets of presentations.
[01:28:11.466 --> 01:28:20.097]  We will hear 30-minute opening arguments from councils for the majority and the minority of this committee.
[01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:29.773]  Jerry Nadler and the Democrat Party are committing treason against this country!
[01:28:30.053 --> 01:28:33.056]  And you can kick me out, but he's the one committing crimes!
[01:28:33.096 --> 01:28:34.317]  You are, Jerry Nadler!
[01:28:34.657 --> 01:28:36.078]  You're the one committing treason!
[01:28:36.399 --> 01:28:37.560]  America's done with this!
[01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:41.003]  America's sick of the treason committed by the Democrat Party!
[01:28:41.747 --> 01:28:45.768]  We're not going to sit here and watch you run in the streets and remove our vote!
[01:28:46.188 --> 01:28:51.269]  We voted for Donald Trump, and they're simply removing him because they don't like him!
[01:28:51.469 --> 01:28:54.270]  Americans are sick of your impeachment, Santa!
[01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:56.690]  They're sick of the Democrat treason!
[01:28:56.710 --> 01:29:01.791]  We know you committed the crimes, and it wasn't Trump!
[01:29:01.831 --> 01:29:04.492]  Trump is innocent!
[01:29:04.512 --> 01:29:05.772]  The committee will come to order.
[01:29:07.091 --> 01:29:20.844]  Obviously, I shouldn't have to remind everyone present that the audience is here to observe, but not to demonstrate, not to indicate agreement or disagreement with any witness or with any member of the committee.
[01:29:21.765 --> 01:29:24.227]  Yeah, I'm Owen Schroeder from Infowars.com.
[01:29:24.428 --> 01:29:25.388]  Infowars.com?
[01:29:25.428 --> 01:29:25.729]  Yeah.
[01:29:25.829 --> 01:29:26.229]  What's your name?
[01:29:26.650 --> 01:29:27.510]  Owen Schroeder.
[01:29:27.631 --> 01:29:31.354]  I think it's ironic I'm being hauled out of here when the Democrats are the ones committing crimes.
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:38.950]  I'm being arrested right now for disruption of Congress.
[01:29:39.170 --> 01:29:41.318]  I'm a criminal for my first amendment rights.
[01:29:41.579 --> 01:29:42.402]  See you right here, folks.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:27.970]  I know one thing, with the Inspector General report coming out and stating exactly what we knew it would, saying, oh, it was a legal investigation of the candidate Trump and his campaign, and then once he was president, sure, we lied to Congress, and sure, people under us said it was an insurance policy, but that's all okay.
[01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:33.073]  A few agents didn't follow all the rules, didn't dot a few I's, cross a few T's, but everybody's done a great job.
[01:30:34.485 --> 01:30:56.834]  And then Jerry Nadler can move forward with his fake illegal impeachment cooked up by the intelligence agencies in the bowels of the Capitol and then can send that on to the Senate so the Senate can be blackmailed and threatened by the deep state to vote against Trump because Trump's signaling weakness in all of this by not being able to get the Justice Department to prosecute clear crimes by its own agency.
[01:30:57.094 --> 01:30:57.814]  But here's the good news.
[01:30:58.814 --> 01:30:59.895]  We got Trump elected.
[01:30:59.975 --> 01:31:01.375]  This audience got Trump elected.
[01:31:01.675 --> 01:31:02.756]  We're the American people.
[01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:04.678]  And we know the swamp's bad.
[01:31:05.138 --> 01:31:06.679]  And we forced the swamp out in the open.
[01:31:06.699 --> 01:31:08.719]  And they're not going to be easy to defeat.
[01:31:08.839 --> 01:31:14.541]  But the process of exposing them and how they're against the country's very existence and how they're criminals is happening.
[01:31:15.121 --> 01:31:21.483]  They are being incredibly damaged right now in their attempts to remove Trump and to censor and bully the American people.
[01:31:21.523 --> 01:31:22.363]  And that's the good news.
[01:31:22.863 --> 01:31:25.484]  But I'll tell you, it's going to take money to hang in there.

[01:31:57.366 --> 01:32:00.727]  With your support and your help, we won't just stay on the air.
[01:32:00.767 --> 01:32:07.390]  We'll continue to fight and take action like Owen Schroyer just did, getting in the face of Nadler in that fake committee illegal hearing.
[01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:09.793]  We're fighting now harder than ever.
[01:32:10.153 --> 01:32:13.056]  Thank you for keeping us on the field and provisioning us in this fight.
[01:32:13.276 --> 01:32:18.541]  You've got our commitment to bust our ass for our family and your families, because we're all in this together.
[01:32:19.201 --> 01:32:20.883]  So again, redouble your efforts now.
[01:32:21.243 --> 01:32:21.924]  We're going to win.
[01:32:23.385 --> 01:32:30.132]  You expect the swamp and the global assess pool to be where we get our redemption?
[01:32:31.533 --> 01:32:32.334]  No, my friends.
[01:32:33.735 --> 01:32:38.321]  Redemption comes from God and us working with God's Spirit in us to do the right thing.
[01:32:39.332 --> 01:32:41.853]  That's why the enemy knows their whole pedophilic religion's coming out.
[01:32:42.153 --> 01:32:43.093]  That's why in the U.S.
[01:32:43.373 --> 01:32:49.514]  and Europe, they're teaching five-year-old children to write love letters to the same sex, and telling them, hey, would you like to be another sex?
[01:32:50.135 --> 01:32:51.795]  So that they can be taken from the parents.
[01:32:52.555 --> 01:32:58.036]  Their rights can be taken from the parents, and the child can be set on a course to have their testicles cut off.
[01:32:58.557 --> 01:33:01.357]  And little girls can be set on course to take male hormones.
[01:33:01.717 --> 01:33:03.358]  This is the blasphemy.
[01:33:03.638 --> 01:33:04.498]  This is the evil.
[01:33:04.558 --> 01:33:08.339]  This is the open sexualization of your children, and it's only gonna get worse.
[01:33:09.409 --> 01:33:17.674]  One month ago in Austin, they said children as young as five in the public schools will be taught how to have anal sex, and will be taught that they're another sex.
[01:33:17.974 --> 01:33:24.399]  And then once your child gets confused, the social workers come in and the process of taking your children from you.
[01:33:24.419 --> 01:33:34.165]  They'll still live with you, but they will now be attacked with the chemical warfare by the cult members of, quote, diversity that are really carrying out a eugenics sterilization program.
[01:33:35.925 --> 01:33:39.050]  So again, keep InfoWars on the air, we'll continue to expose these people.
[01:33:39.251 --> 01:33:43.137]  I've been told by the globalists, don't talk about the trans agenda, don't talk about Islam.
[01:33:44.386 --> 01:33:50.110]  And don't talk about the pedophilia, because that's everything they're into and who they are, and I'm gonna talk about it a lot.
[01:33:50.751 --> 01:33:54.193]  And I'm never selling out, I'm never backing down, but we could give out.
[01:33:54.233 --> 01:34:02.999]  The only way we're on air and we stay on air is you keep us on air by spreading the word, by supporting those local AM and FM affiliates, and by buying products at infowarestore.com.
[01:34:03.239 --> 01:34:04.240]  And finally, your prayers.
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:05.321]  Take action now.
[01:34:05.821 --> 01:34:06.082]  Okay.
[01:34:07.002 --> 01:34:08.023]  I wanna go to your phone calls.
[01:34:10.465 --> 01:34:11.946]  I've got the Attorney General's statement here.
[01:34:13.936 --> 01:34:16.838]  He's like, yeah, it's bad what they did politically and it shouldn't happen.
[01:34:16.878 --> 01:34:19.500]  Everybody should be worried and the current director's worried about it.
[01:34:20.041 --> 01:34:21.161]  But nobody's getting in trouble.
[01:34:22.903 --> 01:34:26.325]  So they're just going to keep doing it and be more encouraged, be more aggressive and more out of control.
[01:34:26.526 --> 01:34:33.951]  Because why would a bureaucracy take power from itself when it's already presided over the evil you see systematically being carried out everywhere?
[01:34:35.632 --> 01:34:39.996]  The only question is, will people just still sit there going, oh, I heard online everything's handled.
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:44.342]  And there's 100,000 secret indictments that are all going to Guantanamo!
[01:34:45.763 --> 01:34:49.946]  You know, I didn't get where I am fighting the globalists because I live in La La Land.
[01:34:49.966 --> 01:34:51.067]  I don't buy lottery tickets.
[01:34:51.447 --> 01:34:53.769]  I don't sign on to Nigerian email scams.
[01:34:55.810 --> 01:34:57.892]  And you know, I'm not knocking folks that like lottery tickets.
[01:34:57.932 --> 01:34:59.433]  If you got the money to buy them, knock yourself out.
[01:35:01.094 --> 01:35:03.215]  But I know scams when I see them, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:03.636 --> 01:35:06.217]  And this whole thing of trust the plan is a scam.
[01:35:07.618 --> 01:35:08.259]  You can trust me.
[01:35:08.299 --> 01:35:09.820]  I've been around 25 years on here.
[01:35:13.154 --> 01:35:18.277]  My dad went and gave speeches when he was in high school against the Communist Party around the United States.
[01:35:21.579 --> 01:35:22.179]  I'm an American.
[01:35:22.439 --> 01:35:23.060]  I'm a patriot.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:24.020]  I'm from Texas.
[01:35:24.841 --> 01:35:25.661]  I've got a track record.
[01:35:25.701 --> 01:35:26.302]  I fight hard.
[01:35:29.703 --> 01:35:35.387]  And we're steering you straight, but you don't need to be steered by anybody.
[01:35:36.387 --> 01:35:37.388]  You already know what's going on.
[01:35:38.936 --> 01:35:41.517]  And we've gotten a lot done in a beachhead that's President Trump.
[01:35:41.557 --> 01:35:47.658]  But if you think he's got it all handled when he's totally surrounded, and you think you can just sit there, everything's gonna be okay.
[01:35:47.678 --> 01:35:48.678]  That's a damn lie.
[01:35:50.499 --> 01:35:51.079]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:35:51.119 --> 01:35:59.041]  We're gonna come back right out of the break with Jay and Mike and Michael and Alex and Logan and Christian and Jason and Josh and so many others.
[01:36:00.681 --> 01:36:03.522]  We got a guest popping in towards the end of the hour.
[01:36:03.542 --> 01:36:04.662]  I'll host a little bit of the next hour.
[01:36:04.682 --> 01:36:07.943]  Let's let him know I'm grabbing 15 minutes the first hour to continue with calls.
[01:36:09.659 --> 01:36:13.741]  And I didn't get to this today, because look at it.
[01:36:14.301 --> 01:36:17.522]  Look at the vaccine inserts just off three vaccines they're giving your kids right now.
[01:36:18.142 --> 01:36:22.764]  This says it can give them neurological disorders, narcolepsy, kill them, give them cancer, type 1 diabetes.
[01:36:23.524 --> 01:36:25.845]  But they tell you on the news, this comes with the shots.
[01:36:26.425 --> 01:36:27.966]  This isn't the fact sheet that's fake.
[01:36:27.986 --> 01:36:29.086]  This is in the shot by law.
[01:36:31.067 --> 01:36:32.888]  And I've got all the PowerPoint presentations.
[01:36:33.208 --> 01:36:34.188]  Look at the stack I've got.
[01:36:34.208 --> 01:36:35.449]  A little bit wider, please.
[01:36:36.206 --> 01:36:39.467]  Look at this stack on vaccine news, even mainline news admitting it kills people.
[01:36:39.907 --> 01:36:40.608]  The PowerPoint.
[01:36:41.488 --> 01:36:43.028]  Then I've got these three inserts alone.
[01:36:43.789 --> 01:36:44.269]  Look at all that.
[01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:51.291]  And the fact that they're trying to shut anybody down that speaks out against it, and they want you arrested now.
[01:36:52.011 --> 01:36:53.552]  And they're putting that on the nightly news.
[01:36:53.932 --> 01:36:56.193]  These people are a house of cards coming down.
[01:36:56.473 --> 01:37:01.095]  They know damn well they're adding stuff to the vaccines on purpose to lower your fertility and to dumb you down.
[01:37:01.135 --> 01:37:01.675]  They admit it.
[01:37:02.611 --> 01:37:05.852]  Gardasil's meant to cause brain damage and infertility.
[01:37:06.492 --> 01:37:09.093]  It's got to be strong enough to fry a little girl's ovaries.
[01:37:09.473 --> 01:37:13.014]  What do you think it does to the rest of her neurological system and her body?
[01:37:13.034 --> 01:37:15.095]  We're going to show you all that.
[01:37:15.355 --> 01:37:20.257]  They knew Gardasil was killing and maiming large numbers of people in the damn trials 15 years ago.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:25.062]  And then now when little girls take it and have convulsions and die, they try to cover it up.
[01:37:25.282 --> 01:37:25.722]  Well, guess what?
[01:37:25.762 --> 01:37:26.923]  You're not going to cover it up.
[01:37:27.423 --> 01:37:30.185]  It's a soft kill weapon on purpose.
[01:37:30.985 --> 01:37:33.487]  And the nurses all know it and the doctors all know it now.
[01:37:34.007 --> 01:37:35.568]  But they get fired if they tell you.
[01:37:35.908 --> 01:37:36.548]  Well, you know what?
[01:37:36.748 --> 01:37:37.609]  We're going to tell you.
[01:37:37.929 --> 01:37:40.651]  And the people pulling all this off one day are going to hang.
[01:37:43.912 --> 01:37:44.473]  Welcome back.
[01:37:44.493 --> 01:37:46.314]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, taking your phone calls.
[01:37:46.394 --> 01:37:48.195]  The IG report came out about an hour ago.
[01:37:50.095 --> 01:37:51.796]  And it is beyond a dud.
[01:37:53.077 --> 01:37:56.239]  There's little typos and things where it doesn't say Comey, it says Carney.
[01:37:56.259 --> 01:37:58.961]  I guess that means like a carnival bar hero.
[01:38:00.102 --> 01:38:01.183]  Sideshow con man.
[01:38:03.364 --> 01:38:07.687]  And Barr has undermined his own DOJ IG report, which we said was going to come.
[01:38:07.707 --> 01:38:08.828]  He'll say, oh, that's not enough.
[01:38:08.868 --> 01:38:09.548]  It didn't do enough.
[01:38:09.568 --> 01:38:13.431]  And then that's supposedly the other side of the equation, but there's no teeth behind it.
[01:38:13.451 --> 01:38:14.432]  There's no power behind it.
[01:38:15.933 --> 01:38:17.374]  So I didn't get suckered by this.
[01:38:20.185 --> 01:38:22.346]  And I know our audience in general didn't get suckered by it.
[01:38:22.546 --> 01:38:23.586]  And I'm not depressed about it.
[01:38:23.626 --> 01:38:24.967]  Globalism is being discredited.
[01:38:25.407 --> 01:38:26.607]  Nationalism is rising.
[01:38:27.027 --> 01:38:28.428]  Christians now know they're under attack.
[01:38:28.508 --> 01:38:30.128]  People understand what's going on.
[01:38:30.648 --> 01:38:33.689]  People are guarding their children more from the state and the corrupt system.
[01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:36.870]  And we're withdrawing our support from Hollywood and all these systems.
[01:38:36.930 --> 01:38:42.012]  But tens of millions of children are still captured in this system and need to be saved.
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:48.165]  A lot of us know what's going on, that gives us limited protection, but a lot of folks don't know.
[01:38:48.245 --> 01:38:53.870]  So the information war is person-to-person, at point-blank range, like it always is at the grassroots.
[01:38:53.971 --> 01:38:56.973]  And we're grassroots, we're not globalist astroturf.
[01:38:58.415 --> 01:39:00.597]  So without further ado, let's take some phone calls.
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:06.903]  Let's go ahead and go to Jay in Wisconsin.
[01:39:06.923 --> 01:39:07.604]  You're on the air, Jay.
[01:39:08.806 --> 01:39:09.907]  Hi, Alex.
[01:39:09.967 --> 01:39:14.911]  Before I jump right into it, I want to say I appreciate you more than just about anyone else in the world.
[01:39:14.931 --> 01:39:26.361]  I think that you are a super patriot, and I do have a couple of things that I'd like to say that I think would help InfoWars when it comes to getting the word out and funding the operation.
[01:39:27.382 --> 01:39:33.287]  When it comes to donations to InfoWars, I think that you should give a choice that allows for a custom amount.
[01:39:33.348 --> 01:39:34.869]  Currently, they're all preset amounts,
[01:39:35.821 --> 01:39:37.362]  I have about four suggestions here.
[01:39:37.482 --> 01:39:45.366]  As part of the shopping cart, I think maybe if you were to allow customers to round up their payment amount in order to spur potential donations, that would be helpful.
[01:39:46.947 --> 01:39:53.731]  I think you should give people the option to forego the free shipping in order to make further contribution to the InfoWars bottom line.
[01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:55.589]  Well, you're absolutely right, because
[01:40:20.121 --> 01:40:24.940]  I've been calling for this, I've been working on this, and maybe now's the time to do it.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:25.302]  I don't know.
[01:40:26.304 --> 01:40:28.566]  I don't feel sorry for myself.
[01:40:28.666 --> 01:40:31.448]  At just a certain point, I get tired of telling people what to do around here, you know what I mean?
[01:40:31.488 --> 01:40:32.588]  But I'm gonna try to get that done.
[01:40:33.029 --> 01:40:33.709]  I really appreciate it.
[01:40:33.729 --> 01:40:38.192]  I've actually made all these recommendations and I don't know why it hasn't happened, but we'll work on it right now.
[01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:38.973]  Keep going.
[01:40:38.993 --> 01:40:39.613]  All right.
[01:40:39.973 --> 01:40:49.940]  And again, to everybody that's listening, listening right now or listening to a podcast later on or whatever, just Google InfoWars Donations and go and make a direct donation.
[01:40:50.672 --> 01:40:57.783]  InfoWars is key to us being able to set back the globalists, to get rid of the... Well, exactly.
[01:40:57.803 --> 01:41:01.268]  You know, my son wants to have a podcast show called I'm Not Bragging.
[01:41:01.308 --> 01:41:02.490]  As I said, I'm not bragging.
[01:41:02.770 --> 01:41:06.095]  They have hearings all the time in intelligence committees and the House...
[01:41:06.896 --> 01:41:10.219]  Armed Services Committee saying we're the enemy of America and shut us down.
[01:41:10.479 --> 01:41:13.782]  That's the globalists that have hijacked the government saying we're the main enemy.
[01:41:13.802 --> 01:41:16.784]  Because we know who they are and they do want us off air, folks.
[01:41:16.824 --> 01:41:18.966]  I'm not trying to act all fancy pants here.
[01:41:19.006 --> 01:41:20.427]  We really are the damn tip of the spear.
[01:41:20.467 --> 01:41:22.729]  And boy, ragtag we are, let me tell you.
[01:41:23.647 --> 01:41:25.128]  Oh, it's all projection, too.
[01:41:25.188 --> 01:41:30.833]  Everything they do is a salvo.
[01:41:30.933 --> 01:41:34.015]  It's a preemptive strike, basically, is what it comes down to.
[01:41:34.035 --> 01:41:37.978]  These things they've done that have frozen Trump in so many ways, it's all projection.
[01:41:38.539 --> 01:41:46.445]  And because of the DOJ not being sufficiently under Trump's control, well, I guess that's kind of the segue to what I really wanted to say.
[01:41:46.865 --> 01:41:51.589]  All of us who are constitutionalists want to see these coup plotters charged and prosecuted.
[01:41:51.789 --> 01:41:52.149]  We're good.
[01:42:09.085 --> 01:42:14.127]  And he fears that prosecutions will be quietly handed off to rogue elements for fake prosecutions.
[01:42:14.407 --> 01:42:19.229]  So, in other words, mere show trials with Comey-like exonerations as the end result.
[01:42:19.269 --> 01:42:22.530]  You know, like when Comey exonerated Hillary, basically.
[01:42:22.710 --> 01:42:23.210]  No, you're right.
[01:42:23.230 --> 01:42:25.891]  I mean, the deep state has got a hundred benches deep.
[01:42:27.252 --> 01:42:29.333]  They can rig trials, they can let people go.
[01:42:30.073 --> 01:42:35.275]  Look at the senator, you know, in the Caribbean with all the 14-year-old girls, and they had him dead to rights and didn't get in trouble for that.
[01:42:36.414 --> 01:42:40.739]  So somehow Trump needs to gain the proper control over the DOJ.
[01:42:40.759 --> 01:42:43.501]  I mean, he's been so poorly advised since the start.
[01:42:43.541 --> 01:42:46.965]  I mean, Reince Priebus stacked him with so many.
[01:42:47.826 --> 01:42:51.129]  These lawyers will lie to your face in ways you can't even imagine.
[01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.990]  I've experienced it.
[01:42:52.210 --> 01:42:57.896]  And it's just this country is just at the professional level is just full of a bunch of scum.
[01:42:58.957 --> 01:43:03.400]  And the average good hard-working person out there just doesn't want power, and so they haven't been involved.
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:07.562]  And my God, you start plowing into the swamp, just the people you find.
[01:43:08.003 --> 01:43:10.144]  And I mean, I'm talking half of them are pedophiles.
[01:43:10.784 --> 01:43:19.910]  I mean, they have really promoted pedophilia, recruited people, and made it to where very soon it should be the new national symbol is a man raping a baby.
[01:43:19.930 --> 01:43:20.530]  And I'm not kidding.
[01:43:20.730 --> 01:43:26.734]  The new American flag should be like a two-year-old baby with a bunch of men raping it, and that should be our new symbol.
[01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:36.930]  Alex, Alex, I have one last thing to say and that's I need to talk with you or one of your very top lieutenants about a huge funding source that dovetails with what you're doing in so many ways.
[01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:40.752]  I have fought some of these same battles back in the early 2000s.
[01:43:42.057 --> 01:43:42.697]  No, I hear you.
[01:43:42.717 --> 01:43:46.240]  Let me put you on hold, and then guys, give me his name and number myself on a piece of paper.
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:50.082]  And then I'll do that, because believe me, I'm up here 18 hours a day a lot of days now.
[01:43:50.642 --> 01:43:52.243]  We just have to push the boulder up the hill.
[01:43:52.263 --> 01:43:52.904]  I have to innovate.
[01:43:52.964 --> 01:43:54.144]  I have to find out what's going on.
[01:43:54.164 --> 01:43:56.466]  I have to just... I'm digging into everything around here.
[01:43:56.486 --> 01:43:58.067]  I'm involved in the satellite contracts.
[01:43:58.107 --> 01:43:59.848]  I'm involved in the trash pickup.
[01:43:59.888 --> 01:44:01.869]  I'm involved in just everything now.
[01:44:02.429 --> 01:44:04.210]  I mean, I take the trash out of the refrigerators.
[01:44:04.311 --> 01:44:07.132]  I clean the toilets, man, because it has to be done by somebody.
[01:44:07.853 --> 01:44:09.113]  And God bless you.
[01:44:09.133 --> 01:44:10.114]  I appreciate your call.
[01:44:10.134 --> 01:44:11.255]  Don't hang up on Jay.
[01:44:12.329 --> 01:44:13.489]  Get his name and number for me, please.
[01:44:13.530 --> 01:44:13.870]  Thank you.
[01:44:14.590 --> 01:44:16.231]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Illinois.
[01:44:16.251 --> 01:44:16.971]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:44:16.991 --> 01:44:18.532]  Hey, Alex.
[01:44:18.592 --> 01:44:19.092]  How you doing?
[01:44:19.492 --> 01:44:20.973]  I'm just, you know, I knew this was coming.
[01:44:22.033 --> 01:44:22.733]  Yeah, I hear you.
[01:44:23.154 --> 01:44:35.619]  Hey, something I haven't really heard a whole lot of people say, and I mean, I'm all for Trump and what he's doing, doing a great job for the country, but could he possibly be like the guy, the fall guy, like he could be in on this?
[01:44:36.199 --> 01:44:39.921]  Like, I'd like to piggyback on what the last caller said.
[01:44:42.085 --> 01:44:43.406]  We all say he needs to do more.
[01:44:44.006 --> 01:44:46.707]  Doesn't seem like he's really fighting back that much.
[01:44:46.767 --> 01:44:49.568]  Where he has the power, he's trying to end these wars.
[01:44:49.848 --> 01:44:50.969]  He's trying to do peace deals.
[01:44:51.369 --> 01:44:52.569]  He's trying to bring troops back.
[01:44:52.909 --> 01:44:54.550]  He is going after the pedophile rings.
[01:44:54.570 --> 01:44:55.590]  He's trying to secure the border.
[01:44:56.011 --> 01:44:57.311]  He's trying to cut the taxes.
[01:44:57.771 --> 01:45:00.512]  He's trying to stand up to China and one-sided trade deals.
[01:45:00.532 --> 01:45:02.013]  I mean, he's done a fabulous job.
[01:45:02.453 --> 01:45:10.236]  The problem is the deep state's going after the American people and taking our liberty away to undermine him and getting ready to take him out with election fraud.
[01:45:10.296 --> 01:45:11.577]  That's why we're so pissed at Trump.
[01:45:12.594 --> 01:45:13.615]  Yeah, no, I get it.
[01:45:13.715 --> 01:45:17.938]  But, man, like, there's no way they should be getting away with what they get away with.
[01:45:18.678 --> 01:45:20.620]  Like, he said he was going to get rid of all those people.
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:22.921]  Like, Barr, why didn't you get rid of him?
[01:45:23.442 --> 01:45:24.342]  Get his own guy in there.
[01:45:25.143 --> 01:45:30.507]  Well, Barr came to him and told him, sir, we'll get the swamp, we'll drain him, and went and said the right things during the hearings.
[01:45:30.587 --> 01:45:34.670]  And it's been, rhetoric-wise, it's been the right thing.
[01:45:34.710 --> 01:45:37.332]  But notice, the actual report does nothing.
[01:45:37.372 --> 01:45:38.052]  It's toothless.
[01:45:38.953 --> 01:45:40.234]  It's a toothless report.
[01:45:41.286 --> 01:45:51.739]  And maybe we'll see an indictment of Lisa Page or Strzok or something, but see, they were given orders from on top all the way up to Obama and to Brennan, and so that's why they can't do it.
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:55.504]  In fact, you're not going to see any indictments go forward.
[01:45:55.945 --> 01:45:57.366]  I predict nothing is done.
[01:45:57.446 --> 01:45:59.829]  I predict Durham does nothing, nothing.
[01:46:01.007 --> 01:46:01.387]  You heard it.
[01:46:01.467 --> 01:46:01.728]  Nothing.
[01:46:01.788 --> 01:46:02.528]  That's what my predict.
[01:46:02.588 --> 01:46:03.089]  It doesn't matter.
[01:46:03.169 --> 01:46:04.750]  We're going to go out and confront the globalists.
[01:46:05.130 --> 01:46:06.091]  We're going to work hard.
[01:46:06.351 --> 01:46:07.492]  We're going to promote Jesus.
[01:46:07.792 --> 01:46:10.074]  We're going to train the Second Amendment and the young people.
[01:46:10.294 --> 01:46:11.015]  We're going to fight.
[01:46:11.335 --> 01:46:12.176]  We're going to win.
[01:46:12.556 --> 01:46:14.237]  We're going to do it like we already did.
[01:46:16.819 --> 01:46:18.320]  We're punching through, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:19.541 --> 01:46:20.662]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:46:20.702 --> 01:46:25.746]  I was just talking to my shopping cart folks during the break, and they were saying, no, we have
[01:46:29.383 --> 01:46:32.285]  The preset amount, you can set any amount you want when you donate.
[01:46:32.865 --> 01:46:36.647]  I guess just the blocks there, say a set number, but you can put any number in you want.
[01:46:36.667 --> 01:46:40.689]  We appreciate those donations, because that way we don't get 20-30% on the sale of a product.
[01:46:41.130 --> 01:46:45.392]  We get, except for the credit card fee or whatever, like 97% to fund our operation, so thank you.
[01:46:46.192 --> 01:46:46.493]  Also...
[01:46:47.574 --> 01:46:49.877]  You can round up on orders at the end of checkout.
[01:46:49.917 --> 01:46:53.020]  Maybe we can make that a little more prominent so people know beforehand.
[01:46:53.501 --> 01:46:56.464]  You can forgo the free shipping if you like at checkout.
[01:46:57.666 --> 01:47:03.272]  And you can also make direct donations there on the shopping cart as well.
[01:47:03.352 --> 01:47:04.354]  So that is there.
[01:47:04.394 --> 01:47:05.875]  But I'm going to make a tutorial video.
[01:47:06.836 --> 01:47:07.436]  Hell, why wait?
[01:47:07.496 --> 01:47:09.057]  I'll be here as late as I need to tonight.
[01:47:09.117 --> 01:47:16.760]  I'll get those done and I will get those out on air and email to all the listeners that are signed up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com.
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:18.841]  So you make sure that you get that.
[01:47:18.881 --> 01:47:21.142]  So thank you, caller, for that information.
[01:47:21.703 --> 01:47:23.704]  That's really important to remind folks of because
[01:47:26.792 --> 01:47:30.515]  I don't want to have to lay people off and again I'm happy to do it.
[01:47:31.015 --> 01:47:34.418]  I'm selling my house because that's where I invested the money to make sure I had a backup.
[01:47:34.458 --> 01:47:38.040]  I don't trust the banks so that I'd have extra money someday if we ever needed it to run things.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:42.924]  I'm gonna hire people and expand and put on full sail as they'd say in the back of the sailing ship days.
[01:47:42.944 --> 01:47:45.185]  You know when you got the wind to go as fast as you can.
[01:47:45.245 --> 01:47:46.606]  We're putting everything in.
[01:47:46.666 --> 01:47:47.147]  We love it.
[01:47:47.387 --> 01:47:48.027]  We enjoy it.
[01:47:48.087 --> 01:47:48.488]  It's fun.
[01:47:48.508 --> 01:47:53.291]  I just don't want our missiles to impact on the surface to use a cheesy Star Wars analogy.
[01:47:53.311 --> 01:47:55.913]  I want them to go down the reactor tubes and go right into the
[01:47:55.933 --> 01:47:56.233]  Thank you.
[01:48:21.952 --> 01:48:24.913]  I'm not even let down by this Inspector General report.
[01:48:25.813 --> 01:48:35.116]  I know there have been some indictments of Andy McCabe and others, but the Justice Department can kill those, and they foregoed blocking prosecution of him a few months ago.
[01:48:35.196 --> 01:48:40.817]  That almost always means that the indictment had happened, but they can just leave those indictments sitting there.
[01:48:42.617 --> 01:48:45.338]  Should the Justice Department have the power to kill indictments by ran juries?
[01:48:45.378 --> 01:48:45.938]  I don't think so.
[01:48:46.559 --> 01:48:48.039]  That just shows how this rogue government's gotten.
[01:48:50.151 --> 01:48:58.097]  And so now the media to make the report look even more legitimate will act like it's illegitimate that Barr has come out and criticized it and said it didn't go far enough.
[01:48:59.818 --> 01:49:00.939]  But that is toothless.
[01:49:03.281 --> 01:49:05.463]  So again, even his criticism means nothing.
[01:49:06.544 --> 01:49:07.524]  And we knew that was coming.
[01:49:07.605 --> 01:49:11.848]  So we nailed it 100% exactly as it is.
[01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:16.291]  Here's the report right here, all 500 pages of it.
[01:49:16.732 --> 01:49:18.053]  We nailed it exactly as we said.
[01:49:20.759 --> 01:49:22.381]  But you know what the Q people will do?
[01:49:23.562 --> 01:49:28.827]  They'll go line up the report on the first word of every line and make up hidden messages in it.
[01:49:31.690 --> 01:49:40.338]  Or the globalist will put... Can I have a document cam shot?
[01:49:40.378 --> 01:49:40.579]  Thanks.
[01:49:41.119 --> 01:49:44.703]  The globalist will put messages in there just to jerk your chain.
[01:49:47.341 --> 01:49:49.102]  Oh, don't go to Congress and confront Nadler.
[01:49:49.403 --> 01:49:50.524]  Just look for codes.
[01:49:51.104 --> 01:49:51.744]  They'll save us.
[01:49:52.465 --> 01:49:53.186]  Secret codes.
[01:49:54.146 --> 01:49:55.607]  Don't send an InfoWars video out.
[01:49:55.627 --> 01:49:56.528]  Don't send an article out.
[01:49:57.029 --> 01:50:02.953]  Don't warn people about all the pedophilia or the schools teaching five-year-olds to write same-sex love letters to each other.
[01:50:02.973 --> 01:50:09.198]  You know, the schools say if a little boy hugs a little girl or kids shake hands, that's harassment and assault.
[01:50:09.518 --> 01:50:11.400]  But you can learn how to give a blowjob.
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:14.062]  You can learn how to have anal sex when you're five.
[01:50:15.623 --> 01:50:19.044]  We can teach third graders how to do things I can't even say on air.
[01:50:19.064 --> 01:50:24.606]  We're trying to arrest people that don't vaccinate now.
[01:50:25.466 --> 01:50:26.166]  Everything's okay!
[01:50:26.186 --> 01:50:26.767]  Trust the plan!
[01:50:31.488 --> 01:50:36.730]  Well, InfoWars launched a plan to believe in America and challenging globalism, and it's been picked up all over the world.
[01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:37.810]  1776 Worldwide is active.
[01:50:38.050 --> 01:50:38.951]  People believe in freedom.
[01:50:38.971 --> 01:50:39.851]  They want it because it's real.
[01:50:41.075 --> 01:50:43.296]  And so, this audience got Trump elected.
[01:50:43.396 --> 01:50:44.337]  You got Trump elected.
[01:50:44.917 --> 01:50:50.720]  Action, and voting, and speaking out, and making donations, and getting the word out, and running for office.
[01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:51.881]  You did it, folks!
[01:50:53.081 --> 01:50:58.804]  Not nebulous imaginary intelligence agencies where they appoint people because they're yes-men and do what they're told.
[01:50:59.945 --> 01:51:04.087]  The resistance and leadership comes from the grassroots and people that care about freedom.
[01:51:04.347 --> 01:51:06.148]  That's where our victory against tyranny is coming.
[01:51:14.454 --> 01:51:15.538]  Gator in North Carolina.
[01:51:15.578 --> 01:51:16.482]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:51:18.450 --> 01:51:20.531]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:51:20.551 --> 01:51:31.699]  First, I want to say that Owen Troyer is what we always knew he was, one heck of a warrior out there doing what most emasculated American men do not have the temerity or the tenacity whatsoever to do.
[01:51:31.719 --> 01:51:44.427]  I speak from experience, having made up many t-shirts in my days, wearing them around the country, condemning the Deep State and Obama, all the other operatives, and having grown men come up to me and shake my hand and virtually cry because they thought I was so brave for wearing a t-shirt.
[01:51:45.385 --> 01:51:49.508]  But the purpose of my call is to say at this point I believe that Donald J. Trump is irrelevant.
[01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:59.796]  I believe that looking for a political solution into this battle on the human side, the earthly side, is never going to come and is never going to happen.
[01:52:00.677 --> 01:52:05.680]  And whether Trump is or is not part of this ruse, whether or not he's a foil or not doesn't matter.
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:06.481]  What matters is
[01:52:07.176 --> 01:52:10.160]  According to the Declaration of Independence and 18 U.S.
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:22.815]  Code 242, we have full legal authority and jurisdiction to go up there and arrest these people and take this government out and replace it for one that is better suited to our well-being and to freedom based on common law.
[01:52:22.835 --> 01:52:25.459]  That's the nature of my point.
[01:52:26.391 --> 01:52:34.117]  I am pretty upset right now with the fact that this Inspector General report did exactly what we said it would do.
[01:52:34.677 --> 01:52:40.402]  I mean, that is a bunch of criminals up there, a bunch of scumbag lawyers that are narcotics trafficking and child molesting.
[01:52:40.742 --> 01:52:42.223]  I mean, my God, let me explain something to you.
[01:52:42.844 --> 01:52:45.385]  Half those people at that level have sex with children.
[01:52:46.206 --> 01:52:48.928]  And a lot of them stab children to death and drink their damn blood, okay?
[01:52:48.948 --> 01:52:54.793]  So, I mean, you think a bunch of people that kill small children on routine bases for their holidays?
[01:52:55.816 --> 01:52:57.417]  You think they're going to turn around and do this?
[01:52:57.457 --> 01:52:58.097]  No, they love it.
[01:52:58.797 --> 01:53:01.018]  And they're going to kill your children as soon as they get a chance to.
[01:53:02.698 --> 01:53:11.061]  But the new IG report comes out and says they can spy illegally, they can lie, they can send people to prison, they can lie about it to Congress, they can break the law.
[01:53:11.081 --> 01:53:23.785]  And I told everybody, don't get bummed out when it comes out and all the magic indictments in the Guantanamo Bay doesn't happen because that's made up.
[01:53:26.892 --> 01:53:28.356]  Trump is drawing from the swamp.
[01:53:30.301 --> 01:53:33.690]  Now there have been some grand juries that have handed down indictments.
[01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:34.813]  Not hundreds, not thousands.
[01:53:36.533 --> 01:53:37.934]  And those have obviously been killed.
[01:53:38.414 --> 01:53:41.216]  So you keep holding your breath for the Durham investigation.
[01:53:42.716 --> 01:53:43.057]  Not me.
[01:53:43.097 --> 01:53:43.937]  I'm not holding my breath.
[01:53:44.557 --> 01:53:45.038]  No, sir.
[01:53:45.518 --> 01:53:47.599]  I'm going to be hitting the streets and I'm going to be working hard.
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:58.845]  I'm going to get more radio affiliates for this show to keep energizing the American people to run more people for office to say we're not going to have five-year-olds learn how to give blowjobs.
[01:53:59.686 --> 01:54:01.407]  And I'm going to show the newscast where it's being taught.
[01:54:03.422 --> 01:54:05.563]  And then we're going to take over our government and we're not going to do that.
[01:54:05.603 --> 01:54:12.706]  And we're going to expose that we don't want 60 plus percent of the refugees that come here never getting a job or getting off welfare.
[01:54:15.448 --> 01:54:18.009]  And we're going to continue to support the president and the things he's doing that are right.
[01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:19.509]  But we're not going to go to sleep.
[01:54:23.831 --> 01:54:25.012]  Look at that mainline headline.
[01:54:25.032 --> 01:54:25.892]  Put that back up, please.
[01:54:26.353 --> 01:54:31.335]  Texas School District, that's Austin, mandates teaching kids out of anal sex.
[01:54:33.135 --> 01:54:33.856]  Seven-year-olds.
[01:54:40.381 --> 01:54:42.342]  I mean, I'm not even trying to cover this.
[01:54:42.422 --> 01:54:43.623]  It's just flooding in.
[01:54:46.845 --> 01:54:47.926]  We had a great guest coming on.
[01:54:47.946 --> 01:54:50.548]  He was on Tucker Carlson last week, last Friday.
[01:54:51.029 --> 01:54:52.109]  He's been a frequent guest here.
[01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:54.191]  He's running for Congress.
[01:54:54.251 --> 01:54:55.132]  He's exposing that the
[01:54:58.146 --> 01:54:59.207]  Sanctuary cities and the rest of it.
[01:54:59.247 --> 01:55:05.692]  We just have to stop it completely because the Democrats are bringing folks in to hate America and organizing them around bringing the country down.
[01:55:05.912 --> 01:55:06.773]  We're not against immigrants.
[01:55:06.813 --> 01:55:08.214]  We're against the way the left's doing this.
[01:55:09.095 --> 01:55:10.576]  There needs to be a total moratorium on it.
[01:55:10.956 --> 01:55:11.356]  Here's one.
[01:55:11.417 --> 01:55:14.599]  Mayors asked Trump to import more refugees to the U.S.
[01:55:15.079 --> 01:55:15.960]  for cultural diversity.
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:22.105]  We're going to get that guest on tomorrow, and I appreciate him holding over to tomorrow, and I apologize.
[01:55:22.145 --> 01:55:23.966]  We had some big things break today.
[01:55:24.106 --> 01:55:27.109]  Peter Dabrowski, have you pronounced that right?
[01:55:29.158 --> 01:55:32.281]  Pete4NC.com, he'll be joining us tomorrow if he can.
[01:55:32.861 --> 01:55:39.327]  We just had the Owen thing in Congress and impeachment hearings and all the rest of it and so much more, but we will get him on tomorrow.
[01:55:40.387 --> 01:55:41.949]  Powerful interview he did with Tucker Carlson.
[01:55:47.133 --> 01:55:48.174]  But I'm beyond angry.
[01:55:48.454 --> 01:55:49.675]  I am in action mode.
[01:55:51.577 --> 01:55:56.221]  I mean, when you see them on the news saying vaccines are safe and effective, have no side effects, no one has ever been hurt by them.
[01:55:57.090 --> 01:55:59.811]  That's like saying nobody's ever been killed by bullets.
[01:56:01.332 --> 01:56:03.112]  Or fires never burned down any trees.
[01:56:03.233 --> 01:56:05.013]  I mean, it's whopper leveled.
[01:56:05.473 --> 01:56:07.594]  It's a bigger lie than saying men can have babies.
[01:56:09.715 --> 01:56:13.317]  But they're all over the news saying arrest people that don't take all their vaccines.
[01:56:17.518 --> 01:56:18.779]  Even though the people that have taken them
[01:56:25.919 --> 01:56:27.219]  Are supposedly protected, even though they're not.
[01:56:27.239 --> 01:56:34.342]  You know, last week, my kids don't get sick very often, but two of my daughters, the oldest one in the middle one, got fever.
[01:56:34.882 --> 01:56:35.242]  Threw up.
[01:56:36.783 --> 01:56:40.104]  They went to the local doctor, and the doctor said, oh, you've got a virus.
[01:56:40.304 --> 01:56:42.105]  And I said to my daughters, did they test you for a virus?
[01:56:42.625 --> 01:56:44.145]  No, they just said it's a 24-hour virus.
[01:56:44.966 --> 01:56:47.947]  And three days later, I said, you're going to the doctor again.
[01:56:47.967 --> 01:56:49.467]  You've got a bacterial infection.
[01:56:50.708 --> 01:56:51.888]  And my wife got sick.
[01:56:53.902 --> 01:56:55.643]  And I said, no, it's, it's bacterial.
[01:56:55.683 --> 01:56:56.004]  You don't.
[01:56:56.984 --> 01:57:00.086]  And then they went and got tested and they have all have a bacterial infection today.
[01:57:01.588 --> 01:57:05.370]  I told him, tell the doctor, do his job and do a damn test.
[01:57:06.031 --> 01:57:07.152]  And an hour later, it came back.
[01:57:09.393 --> 01:57:10.294]  And they've all got strep.
[01:57:17.199 --> 01:57:18.760]  Probably from some food they ate or something.
[01:57:21.681 --> 01:57:28.127]  But you just have to stop believing the system constantly and just going along because the average person is on total autopilot.
[01:57:28.607 --> 01:57:33.592]  The average doctor is thinking about when they're going to go play golf and how they're going to cram their mistress in with their wife.
[01:57:35.613 --> 01:57:36.674]  And that's if they're a nice guy.
[01:57:40.197 --> 01:57:41.979]  America is decadent and evil now.
[01:57:42.019 --> 01:57:42.900]  We're a cursed nation.
[01:57:44.349 --> 01:57:49.212]  I'm going to go to Josh, Jordan, Jessica, Michael, Alex, Christian, Jason before the show ends.
[01:57:49.232 --> 01:57:50.852]  Let's go to Josh right now in Ohio.
[01:57:51.233 --> 01:57:52.013]  Thanks for holding, Josh.
[01:57:52.053 --> 01:57:52.353]  Welcome.
[01:57:53.534 --> 01:57:54.054]  Howdy, Alex.
[01:57:54.194 --> 01:57:54.574]  How are you?
[01:57:55.315 --> 01:57:56.896]  You know, I knew this was coming.
[01:57:56.936 --> 01:58:01.718]  I didn't want to be right about the IG report, but I'm telling you, it's just exactly what we thought it would be.
[01:58:03.199 --> 01:58:03.459]  I know.
[01:58:03.519 --> 01:58:04.900]  I feel the same way with you.
[01:58:05.402 --> 01:58:06.422]  And I want to say something.
[01:58:06.463 --> 01:58:09.744]  I commend Owen and I commend him for what he stood up and did today.
[01:58:10.104 --> 01:58:18.488]  That just shows that all of us Americans that are sick of all this bullshit that Congress and everybody plays every system and points the finger game.
[01:58:19.028 --> 01:58:20.549]  There needs to be action done.
[01:58:22.089 --> 01:58:27.472]  Yeah, we've got a bunch of crooks up there that have been robbing and selling the richest nation in the world off for at least 40, 50 years.
[01:58:29.662 --> 01:58:33.267]  And they can't even stop their own corruption selling out the ship that they're living on.
[01:58:33.968 --> 01:58:36.972]  So part of them want to fix things, part of them know it's gone too far.
[01:58:37.353 --> 01:58:39.055]  The other side is completely insane.
[01:58:39.075 --> 01:58:43.160]  I mean, the Democrats are frothing at the mouth drugged out zombies.
[01:58:44.371 --> 01:58:44.992]  They're demons.
[01:58:45.172 --> 01:58:50.255]  They are just demons, and they want to help their pocketbook instead of helping us American people.
[01:58:50.735 --> 01:58:53.417]  What our president wants to do is help us American people.
[01:58:53.657 --> 01:59:01.722]  And I think the reason why they hate our president so much is because he is one of the closest people to our founding fathers, and he doesn't play no bullshit with us.
[01:59:02.003 --> 01:59:08.027]  Alright, I gotta let you go with the cussing, because you do it once, we can delay it out.
[01:59:08.067 --> 01:59:10.608]  You do it again, I gotta let you go, because our stations can get fines.
[01:59:11.169 --> 01:59:12.529]  And I know CNN gets to cuss.
[01:59:12.569 --> 01:59:13.070]  They're liberals.
[01:59:14.522 --> 01:59:15.403]  All these court rulings.
[01:59:15.863 --> 01:59:21.388]  Liberals can contract to kill ICE agents on air and tell people, I want to pay, you know, money if you kill ICE agents.
[01:59:21.428 --> 01:59:23.089]  And then the jury says, oh, that's okay.
[01:59:23.329 --> 01:59:23.870]  You're a liberal.
[01:59:26.592 --> 01:59:31.276]  I wouldn't say kill ICE agents, but if I did, I'd go to prison and I should.
[01:59:32.037 --> 01:59:33.598]  So there's a, there's a double thing here.
[01:59:34.338 --> 01:59:34.599]  Okay.
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:37.061]  And everybody knows that.
[01:59:38.222 --> 01:59:40.404]  Jessica in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:59:40.444 --> 01:59:40.744]  Welcome.
[01:59:43.581 --> 01:59:44.682]  Hello, can you hear me?
[01:59:44.702 --> 01:59:45.102]  I sure can.
[01:59:45.122 --> 01:59:45.702]  Thanks for calling.
[01:59:46.142 --> 01:59:48.324]  I guess you're calling on WLUV.
[01:59:48.344 --> 01:59:50.325]  I should plug what stations people call in on.
[01:59:50.345 --> 01:59:50.645]  Go ahead.
[01:59:51.565 --> 01:59:52.566]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:59:53.046 --> 01:59:56.949]  I just wanted to say, you know, we listen to you guys in this household.
[01:59:56.969 --> 01:59:59.010]  We drive with the baby in the car.
[01:59:59.670 --> 02:00:01.911]  It's one of the best ways she falls asleep.
[02:00:01.971 --> 02:00:06.554]  I mean, she's sitting here smiling at your voice and, you know, looking at the radio in the kitchen.
[02:00:06.594 --> 02:00:07.815]  I mean, she knows your voice.
[02:00:07.835 --> 02:00:10.136]  She says, oh yeah, she's talking to you right now.
[02:00:10.706 --> 02:00:14.309]  But I wanted to say that, you know, we spend money on all your products.
[02:00:14.469 --> 02:00:15.070]  I love them.
[02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:24.197]  You know, we tried to have a baby last year and until I started taking my iodine and, you know, ultimate female force, you know, we couldn't have a baby.
[02:00:24.858 --> 02:00:28.080]  And this year we just had our baby on October 1st.
[02:00:28.140 --> 02:00:33.144]  I want to say thank you so much for having these great products because I would have never been able to meet my first child.
[02:00:34.205 --> 02:00:36.946]  And you know what to say about the impeachment, about Trump?
[02:00:37.366 --> 02:00:41.847]  I say, if you don't like the president that you have at the current moment, go out and vote.
[02:00:42.047 --> 02:00:43.847]  Don't just sit on your couch and complain about it.
[02:00:44.187 --> 02:00:45.628]  Get out there and vote.
[02:00:46.048 --> 02:00:51.469]  Because I hear about a lot of people who just sit around and say, oh, you know, I'm not going to vote because I don't like who's there.
[02:00:52.109 --> 02:00:54.390]  What's going to help if you just do nothing?
[02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.830]  Stay there, Jessica.
[02:00:55.850 --> 02:00:57.331]  I want you to be able to finish up with this point.
[02:00:57.351 --> 02:00:57.991]  You're absolutely right.
[02:00:58.011 --> 02:01:00.131]  People say, oh, well, voting, there's a lot of fraud.
[02:01:00.271 --> 02:01:00.551]  Yes.
[02:01:01.392 --> 02:01:02.432]  And the research is clear.
[02:01:03.450 --> 02:01:04.991]  Landslides, they have trouble stealing.
[02:01:05.971 --> 02:01:07.492]  Close races, they can steal easily.
[02:01:07.852 --> 02:01:09.113]  We need a landslide for Trump.
[02:01:09.653 --> 02:01:10.874]  We'll be right back with the fourth hour.
[02:01:10.894 --> 02:01:15.036]  I'll get to all your calls, finish up with Jessica, and then Gerald Cilente's coming up.
[02:01:17.918 --> 02:01:19.058]  I'm gonna go right back to your calls.
[02:01:20.699 --> 02:01:26.742]  And if I seem angry and bummed out sometimes here on air, it's not with the audience, it's not with our listeners, the crew.
[02:01:27.323 --> 02:01:29.384]  It's just that I do care.
[02:01:30.899 --> 02:01:34.822]  And it's not from some goody two-shoed bleeding heart place.
[02:01:35.863 --> 02:01:40.206]  It's from a place where I know that a bunch of innocent people are being hurt by diabolical conscious evil.
[02:01:42.568 --> 02:01:51.835]  And they're openly announcing the human animal clones and gene-edited babies and Beijing and the communist Chinese are running the global internet standardization.
[02:01:52.395 --> 02:01:53.196]  Now it's official.
[02:01:57.162 --> 02:02:01.084]  And all this political correctness is meant to destroy freedom of speech and the families under attack.
[02:02:01.784 --> 02:02:02.985]  I believe in humanity.
[02:02:03.805 --> 02:02:10.908]  And I can't enjoy my daily life when we're being overrun like this.
[02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:14.290]  And here's the way evil works.
[02:02:15.851 --> 02:02:18.252]  It's either taken over or it's on its heels.
[02:02:19.392 --> 02:02:20.353]  There's not an equilibrium.
[02:02:20.913 --> 02:02:26.496]  This Illuminati thing about balance and some good, some evil, that is the total creed of evil.
[02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:32.210]  Of course there's always going to be good and evil in the universe.
[02:02:35.533 --> 02:02:38.094]  Until God decides to end that experiment.
[02:02:41.257 --> 02:02:48.521]  But the idea that we just let it flourish because it's supposed to already be there, like some species of animal, is not the case.
[02:02:50.383 --> 02:02:53.044]  And so if you're not upset and pissed off, there's something wrong with you.
[02:02:53.065 --> 02:02:55.346]  We're supposed to be angry and upset about this.
[02:02:55.686 --> 02:02:57.167]  This is not normal what's going on.
[02:02:57.187 --> 02:02:58.008]  It's not natural.
[02:02:59.735 --> 02:03:00.996]  We're being overrun by evil.
[02:03:02.978 --> 02:03:04.340]  It doesn't want to allow us to exist.
[02:03:05.061 --> 02:03:06.482]  It doesn't live in equilibrium with good.
[02:03:06.602 --> 02:03:07.843]  It wants to extinguish it.
[02:03:12.468 --> 02:03:14.050]  Alright, Jessica in Illinois finishing up.
[02:03:14.771 --> 02:03:15.652]  I'm intrigued by...
[02:03:17.403 --> 02:03:20.886]  You're saying you couldn't have a baby how long you were trying and what happened.
[02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:26.511]  And it's well known that iodine deficiency causes massive infertility, causes all sorts of thyroid problems.
[02:03:26.891 --> 02:03:28.112]  People die without iodine.
[02:03:28.152 --> 02:03:30.314]  I mean, it's an essential thing like vitamin C or oxygen.
[02:03:30.554 --> 02:03:32.656]  It just takes longer to die without it than, say, oxygen.
[02:03:32.716 --> 02:03:33.657]  Oxygen takes a few minutes.
[02:03:34.017 --> 02:03:35.178]  Water takes a week or so.
[02:03:35.499 --> 02:03:36.400]  Food takes about a month.
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:37.320]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[02:04:00.254 --> 02:04:06.738]  I started taking them after our first miscarriage last year in October, and I started feeling better.
[02:04:07.819 --> 02:04:14.143]  We tried again, and about four months later, we got pregnant again.
[02:04:14.403 --> 02:04:20.767]  We kept getting the ultrasounds and more and more ultrasounds, and I kept thinking, this one's going to happen too.
[02:04:21.067 --> 02:04:22.248]  We're going to miscarry again.
[02:04:22.808 --> 02:04:23.549]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:04:38.695 --> 02:04:39.735]  Well, ma'am, there's no doubt.
[02:05:04.981 --> 02:05:20.355]  This is a chemical biological weapons program to reduce the population and dump people down to be more orderly and controllable and they admit they're doing it in all these globalist documents and you're absolutely right and the IQ is dropping, the life expectancy is dropping, the neurological disorders are off the chart.
[02:05:21.136 --> 02:05:21.556]  I don't know.
[02:05:36.383 --> 02:05:43.625]  And now they have hundreds of vaccines they want to make us take because they got away with giving us deadly Gardasil that's killed thousands of people and maimed hundreds of thousands.
[02:05:44.085 --> 02:05:45.426]  All these other governments have banned it.
[02:05:45.746 --> 02:05:47.927]  So they're testing what can they get away with us.
[02:05:48.007 --> 02:05:50.707]  So thank God you've got that great baby, a true gift from God.
[02:05:50.747 --> 02:05:51.608]  Now warn others.
[02:05:51.928 --> 02:05:54.349]  Thank you, Jessica, and thanks for talking about our local station.
[02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:55.869]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:05:57.570 --> 02:06:01.591]  Did you think that the inspector general appointed by Obama
[02:06:03.086 --> 02:06:08.217]  Horowitz, did you really think he was going to go after the deep state that he's a big fish in?
[02:06:10.743 --> 02:06:12.426]  No, ladies and gentlemen, that didn't happen.
[02:06:14.085 --> 02:06:18.607]  And Barr was brought in as a big insider to clean things up and to get the deep state war to stop.
[02:06:19.508 --> 02:06:24.270]  And Trump offered olive branches to the system to just let America be great again and don't sell us out.
[02:06:24.730 --> 02:06:27.291]  Tried to explain how these policies would be better for our nation.
[02:06:27.732 --> 02:06:30.653]  They said, we want America to go away in the globalist paradigm.
[02:06:30.893 --> 02:06:32.294]  We've already invested in China.
[02:06:32.534 --> 02:06:34.795]  Lloyd Blankfein three years ago bragged about that.
[02:06:36.816 --> 02:06:40.678]  Xi Jinping went with Juncker to the Davos event.
[02:06:42.349 --> 02:06:43.650]  Two years and ten months ago.
[02:06:45.231 --> 02:06:45.952]  In January of 2017.
[02:06:47.052 --> 02:06:52.416]  And said, we will defeat America, Trump, and the populist.
[02:06:52.697 --> 02:06:54.278]  They declared war on us!
[02:06:56.099 --> 02:06:58.421]  And yeah, we've come a long way from the coma we were in.
[02:06:58.441 --> 02:06:59.682]  So I want to be positive.
[02:07:05.006 --> 02:07:10.290]  But... The swamp is deep.
[02:07:11.636 --> 02:07:20.680]  And I'm ashamed that more Americans, when China runs the UN Global Standardization for the Internet, the surveillance, the Internet ID, it's all being announced.
[02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:24.041]  The face scanning systems on your phone is run by China.
[02:07:25.042 --> 02:07:25.542]  Agreed to.
[02:07:25.882 --> 02:07:27.963]  The policy is set by them.
[02:07:29.244 --> 02:07:30.664]  They're running the planetary government now.
[02:07:30.684 --> 02:07:33.266]  It was always meant to be that way.
[02:07:34.026 --> 02:07:36.787]  And that more Americans don't rally against that, it's so dangerous.
[02:07:37.728 --> 02:07:38.548]  For their own interest.
[02:07:39.701 --> 02:07:42.262]  Because there's a spirit of evil that wants to see us go down.
[02:07:44.863 --> 02:07:46.803]  Alex in Michigan, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[02:07:48.104 --> 02:07:48.344]  Hello?
[02:07:48.364 --> 02:07:49.144]  Yes, sir.
[02:07:50.264 --> 02:07:55.846]  Hey, I wanted to talk about impeachment at first, but I think you guys basically covered it.
[02:07:55.866 --> 02:08:01.108]  But I think something more important, I just want to get through this quickly because I've called like eight times and I've gotten cut out every time.
[02:08:03.969 --> 02:08:06.970]  A couple days ago, you were talking about how some people
[02:08:07.927 --> 02:08:14.331]  Uh, they can't handle, like, God and the universe, and they just, like, they, uh, they end up, like, curling up.
[02:08:17.193 --> 02:08:17.413]  Yes.
[02:08:17.893 --> 02:08:26.338]  I just, yeah, I, uh, I was just, like, I'm like that, and I wanted to know, like, what I should do to counter that, or to be, to stand up for myself.
[02:08:26.378 --> 02:08:29.100]  Well, that's because, that's because the Holy Spirit
[02:08:30.475 --> 02:08:33.577]  God's transmission is unable to fully penetrate.
[02:08:33.617 --> 02:08:34.818]  There's something blocking that.
[02:08:34.838 --> 02:08:45.606]  You've got to pray for God to remove that, and you've got to ask God, the real God of the universe, the real creator, and God knows who that is, to step in and to push
[02:08:48.208 --> 02:08:52.111]  The transmission blocking that away.
[02:08:52.151 --> 02:08:55.094]  You've got to ask God into your heart and just keep praying that.
[02:08:56.155 --> 02:09:05.183]  And then you've got to deal with what comes in the process of that because the enemy will try to discourage you, will attack you up front to scare you into submission.
[02:09:05.203 --> 02:09:07.705]  But then you're going to know God's real more intensely.
[02:09:07.725 --> 02:09:12.889]  And then like a storm blowing off, God's going to push it aside because you've opened up.
[02:09:13.670 --> 02:09:19.492]  And because God's free will though, God's not going to rape you, rape you psychically, and then you'll experience that.
[02:09:21.433 --> 02:09:31.536]  Man, I hope so, because it's been like three years, and just every time it's about to, something's about to happen, I just get overwhelmed with fear, and I guess just keep praying.
[02:09:32.635 --> 02:09:33.476]  You don't need to worry.
[02:09:33.536 --> 02:09:38.360]  You need to be afraid of not getting with God and say, I don't care about the fear and that threat.
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:41.422]  You feel that block there saying, you know, you don't want to do this.
[02:09:41.482 --> 02:09:43.904]  It'll be a lot better if you just, no, no, don't go with that.
[02:09:44.024 --> 02:09:47.067]  No, no, just, just, you know, bad things are going to happen.
[02:09:47.087 --> 02:09:48.968]  You know, you, you, you, you don't want to go with God.
[02:09:49.009 --> 02:09:52.071]  You know, we'll be nice to you if you just don't go with God.
[02:09:52.111 --> 02:09:54.653]  That's, that's literal entities, my friend.
[02:09:55.414 --> 02:09:57.535]  You need to just say, no, I want Jesus.
[02:09:57.796 --> 02:09:58.596]  Jesus protect me.
[02:09:58.656 --> 02:09:59.257]  Jesus help me.
[02:10:00.694 --> 02:10:01.815]  Cry out to Jesus Christ.
[02:10:02.555 --> 02:10:06.138]  Get on your knees and cry out to Jesus Christ to save you and protect you.
[02:10:06.398 --> 02:10:07.499]  And God will save you.
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:09.220]  100% man.
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:09.561]  Thank you.
[02:10:09.841 --> 02:10:14.985]  And I appreciate the soliloquies you go on about this God and consciousness.
[02:10:15.325 --> 02:10:16.426]  You never know who's watching.
[02:10:16.746 --> 02:10:17.847]  That helps me a lot man.
[02:10:17.867 --> 02:10:18.727]  I appreciate you a lot.
[02:10:18.908 --> 02:10:20.028]  Well that helps me a lot too.
[02:10:20.108 --> 02:10:20.529]  Believe me.
[02:10:23.551 --> 02:10:24.712]  I've been through a lot in my life.
[02:10:24.752 --> 02:10:25.572]  I've seen a lot of things.
[02:10:25.793 --> 02:10:26.653]  And so I understand.
[02:10:28.254 --> 02:10:34.096]  There'll come a day when you've been close to God so long that none of their stuff even matters anymore, and there's no threats, no fear of them.
[02:10:34.536 --> 02:10:38.057]  But it's sad that other people aren't strong enough to just beat this quicker.
[02:10:38.157 --> 02:10:39.797]  I mean, it's so pathetic.
[02:10:39.858 --> 02:10:45.239]  It's just like the Bible says at the end, and the devil's chained up in a cage, and people are saying, that's who got away with all this?
[02:10:45.499 --> 02:10:46.940]  That's the master villain?
[02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:50.681]  When people can see what we really are compared to the devil?
[02:10:51.441 --> 02:10:53.382]  The devil is jealous of you.
[02:10:55.262 --> 02:10:57.863]  Satan wants to destroy you because you're so powerful.
[02:10:59.889 --> 02:11:02.432]  But once you realize you have that power, you're not going to want the power anymore.
[02:11:02.972 --> 02:11:05.475]  Because you're going to realize it's all part of a larger plan.
[02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:12.102]  Alright, let's go to Christian in Missouri.
[02:11:12.142 --> 02:11:12.923]  Christian, thanks for holding.
[02:11:12.943 --> 02:11:13.263]  Go ahead.
[02:11:14.644 --> 02:11:17.808]  Owen Schroyer, the Delusion Destroyer!
[02:11:18.348 --> 02:11:19.670]  Out of St.
[02:11:19.690 --> 02:11:20.491]  Louis, Missouri.
[02:11:20.651 --> 02:11:21.492]  Isn't Owen awesome?
[02:11:22.213 --> 02:11:22.593]  He is.
[02:11:22.874 --> 02:11:23.695]  I love that man.
[02:11:23.775 --> 02:11:25.837]  I called him to the show once about a week ago.
[02:11:25.857 --> 02:11:28.600]  I tell you what, we do appreciate him in the Midwest.
[02:11:28.620 --> 02:11:29.621]  He's an inspiration.
[02:11:30.122 --> 02:11:36.929]  At 9.09 this morning, I don't think it was the same time, but at 9.09 this morning, I said to my wife, I said, today is going to be a big day.
[02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:38.111]  And I can feel it.
[02:11:38.151 --> 02:11:38.912]  There was a surge.
[02:11:38.972 --> 02:11:39.953]  I could feel that surge.
[02:11:41.348 --> 02:11:44.669]  And it was just someone finally standing up to those monsters.
[02:11:45.089 --> 02:11:46.409]  And it sure was a little thing.
[02:11:46.689 --> 02:11:48.229]  But see how a little thing is so big?
[02:11:48.829 --> 02:11:50.070]  And he's doing what I can't.
[02:11:50.410 --> 02:11:51.090]  I'm disabled.
[02:11:51.610 --> 02:11:53.830]  And, you know, he's able to get out there and do this.
[02:11:53.990 --> 02:12:02.492]  But brother, when you spread the word about us, brother, when you spread the word about us, and when you financially support us and get great products, Christian, you were there.
[02:12:02.512 --> 02:12:03.492]  That was you today.
[02:12:03.912 --> 02:12:05.832]  You guys put Owen in the field today.
[02:12:05.852 --> 02:12:06.973]  It blanked me.
[02:12:10.798 --> 02:12:14.239]  Hey, on today's subject though, I was talking to my wife about this.
[02:12:14.299 --> 02:12:16.159]  I said, one of three things is probably going to come out.
[02:12:16.559 --> 02:12:17.479]  We're all going to go to jail.
[02:12:17.499 --> 02:12:19.800]  There's going to be something in the middle to make us all happy.
[02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:20.940]  That's what I predicted.
[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:23.781]  Or there's going to be something on the opposite end where nothing really happens.
[02:12:24.381 --> 02:12:25.321]  They just made a mistake.
[02:12:25.741 --> 02:12:26.801]  They just inspired me.
[02:12:27.221 --> 02:12:27.742]  I'm mad.
[02:12:28.522 --> 02:12:29.462]  I ain't going to put up with this.
[02:12:29.722 --> 02:12:33.283]  If it was all of them, we probably all went back to sleep, maybe kind of.
[02:12:33.323 --> 02:12:33.683]  I don't know.
[02:12:33.723 --> 02:12:37.484]  We've all been happy and, you know, it would have felt kind of empty.
[02:12:38.024 --> 02:12:39.424]  But now we've got a reason to fight.
[02:12:41.297 --> 02:12:42.037]  You're right, Christian.
[02:12:42.078 --> 02:12:42.618]  God bless you.
[02:12:42.638 --> 02:12:43.538]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:43.558 --> 02:12:47.101]  Yeah, I felt a surge this morning, literally, and thought, we're going to take action.
[02:12:47.141 --> 02:12:48.241]  We're going to march on Congress.
[02:12:48.261 --> 02:12:49.202]  People are going to hit the streets.
[02:12:49.502 --> 02:12:51.883]  That's the answer, is empowering people to do that.
[02:12:52.384 --> 02:12:55.306]  And then five minutes later, it was happening.
[02:12:55.326 --> 02:12:57.427]  And I told the reporter on the phone, I go, how long ago it happened?
[02:12:57.447 --> 02:12:58.187]  About five minutes ago.
[02:12:58.467 --> 02:12:59.428]  I went and looked at the time.
[02:13:00.929 --> 02:13:01.429]  Looked back on it.
[02:13:01.449 --> 02:13:05.692]  I was like, literally, I felt the surge of that happening because that little action was so big.
[02:13:05.712 --> 02:13:08.353]  If you let one ant stand up, they might all stand up.
[02:13:08.874 --> 02:13:10.295]  Jordan and Louisiana, then Jason.
[02:13:10.315 --> 02:13:10.795]  Go ahead, Jordan.
[02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:15.983]  Hey Alex, I've been listening to you since 2011-2012.
[02:13:16.724 --> 02:13:21.888]  You're right, spreading the word of mouth by word of mouth is the best way to get across.
[02:13:21.908 --> 02:13:26.652]  I had a customer that introduced me to your show and I've been listening ever since.
[02:13:28.514 --> 02:13:37.662]  I just wanted to say that I think the Inspector General Report is exactly written by the same people who wrote the Mueller Report.
[02:13:38.803 --> 02:13:40.224]  It's a nothing burger on purpose.
[02:13:41.403 --> 02:13:43.304]  And it's completely ridiculous.
[02:13:45.605 --> 02:13:46.285]  It's a farce.
[02:13:46.925 --> 02:13:58.030]  And, you know, I've been introduced to the legal process by Judge Dale about how America was corporatized, run by all these large corporations.
[02:13:58.070 --> 02:14:04.452]  And you've been saying that for a long time, and just reading that and seeing what happened today.
[02:14:06.763 --> 02:14:08.747]  It's time for everybody to take action.
[02:14:09.449 --> 02:14:12.155]  It's we the people, not... We don't worship the government.
[02:14:12.255 --> 02:14:13.318]  We are the government.
[02:14:14.140 --> 02:14:14.941]  That's right, brother.
[02:14:15.202 --> 02:14:15.342]  And...
[02:14:17.625 --> 02:14:21.147]  They can't report on the corruption because they're all corrupt at a certain point.
[02:14:21.567 --> 02:14:23.028]  And so they're all blackmailing each other.
[02:14:23.048 --> 02:14:26.370]  And then foreign governments come in and they totally roll over them for money.
[02:14:26.530 --> 02:14:32.433]  And because the foreign governments are unified, China's unified, they don't allow this kind of stuff at their governmental level.
[02:14:32.453 --> 02:14:35.455]  They're taking over because we're run by a bunch of scum.
[02:14:35.895 --> 02:14:37.015]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:14:37.536 --> 02:14:39.637]  Jason, real fast in California, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:14:40.888 --> 02:14:42.788]  Hey Alex, first time caller.
[02:14:42.848 --> 02:14:44.029]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:14:44.049 --> 02:14:44.969]  Welcome.
[02:14:45.349 --> 02:14:52.131]  I have a little more faith in the IG report than you at the moment, although I understand the frustration.
[02:14:53.291 --> 02:15:01.873]  Faith is the only thing keeping me going, and I believe that most Americans with a brain will see the impeachment scam that's going on.
[02:15:01.953 --> 02:15:10.195]  They'll see the IG report and all the Brennan and all the corrupt FBI officials that were behind it.
[02:15:11.025 --> 02:15:18.169]  And, um, I saw Durham and General Barr, they came out and said, um, that they disagree with what the IG report put out.
[02:15:18.269 --> 02:15:28.234]  So, um, I'm hoping that people will connect the dots and, uh, you know, see that the IG report, you know... Well, hey, hey, all I'm saying is I'm not gonna wait for Durham.
[02:15:28.254 --> 02:15:30.135]  I'm gonna expose and fight the Globalists, but God bless you.
[02:15:30.155 --> 02:15:30.816]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:30.836 --> 02:15:31.276]  Great point.
[02:15:31.656 --> 02:15:32.737]  I'm gonna introduce Gerald Cilente.
[02:15:33.717 --> 02:15:34.858]  Alright, Gerald Cilente.
[02:15:34.878 --> 02:15:37.339]  Best-selling author.
[02:15:37.919 --> 02:15:38.680]  Good friend of mine.
[02:15:39.679 --> 02:15:43.301]  Patriot Trends Research.com is taking over right now and I know he's got a lot to cover.
[02:15:44.382 --> 02:15:49.686]  But I wanted to just state, because I heard the last caller say, hey, let's not be too down, let's be optimistic.
[02:15:49.826 --> 02:15:50.546]  I'm optimistic.
[02:15:50.666 --> 02:15:52.248]  America is waking up to globalism.
[02:15:53.588 --> 02:15:55.690]  Nationalists and populists are getting elected all over.
[02:15:56.690 --> 02:15:59.212]  And so that's a lot better than we were five years ago.
[02:16:00.233 --> 02:16:07.598]  But I don't expect an Inspector General appointed by Obama to expose Obama and his illegal operation with Hillary against Trump in the campaign.
[02:16:09.192 --> 02:16:10.953]  Now, maybe Durham's gonna be different.
[02:16:11.793 --> 02:16:13.273]  But I'm not gonna sit here and hold my breath.
[02:16:13.293 --> 02:16:18.095]  You know, this was supposedly gonna discredit the impeachment and be the big punch in the gut to all this, and of course it's not.
[02:16:20.356 --> 02:16:22.557]  But Durham, who's running the investigation,
[02:16:23.735 --> 02:16:37.047]  One of the criminal investigations of the fake Russiagate operation says, this is today, I have the utmost respect for the mission of the Office of Inspector General and the comprehensive work that went into the report prepared by Mr. Horowitz and his staff.
[02:16:37.087 --> 02:16:39.930]  However, our investigation is not limited to developing
[02:16:40.490 --> 02:16:40.990]  We're good to go.
[02:17:07.395 --> 02:17:21.241]  Again, last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report's conclusions as to predication, excuse me, how they started it and how the FBI case was opened.
[02:17:23.542 --> 02:17:24.743]  And that's what he has to say.
[02:17:24.783 --> 02:17:33.827]  So, I'm just not betting on people from the deep state because you can have the Deputy Attorney General kill indictments that Durham calls for.
[02:17:35.953 --> 02:17:37.613]  Now, Gerald Solente is a smart guy.
[02:17:37.693 --> 02:17:42.294]  I can't wait to eat my lunch and listen to the rest of this hour and hear what he has to say.
[02:17:43.275 --> 02:17:45.575]  Trump's doing a great job trying to end these wars and do peace deals.
[02:17:45.615 --> 02:17:50.476]  He's doing a great job on many fronts, but letting the censorship go on and letting all this unfold.
[02:17:50.656 --> 02:17:52.257]  What is your report card on this, Gerald?
[02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:53.317]  And please take over.
[02:17:53.337 --> 02:17:54.397]  I appreciate you being here today.
[02:17:54.457 --> 02:17:57.018]  And what are you thinking is going to really unfold?
[02:17:57.058 --> 02:17:59.359]  And what are your trends for 2020 election with 329 days out, my friend?
[02:18:02.503 --> 02:18:04.604]  Well, we're coming out with our top trends for 2020.
[02:18:04.664 --> 02:18:06.545]  They're going to be out tomorrow.
[02:18:07.165 --> 02:18:10.847]  And one of them is Trump by default in 2020.
[02:18:11.587 --> 02:18:13.248]  And all we do is look at the numbers.
[02:18:13.308 --> 02:18:20.571]  And you know, we were the first magazine back in May of 2016 to forecast Trump a winner.
[02:18:21.572 --> 02:18:22.972]  And I'm a political atheist.
[02:18:23.052 --> 02:18:24.773]  I don't take sides on these things.
[02:18:25.193 --> 02:18:29.155]  But when you look at who he's running against, if Biden comes up
[02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:36.294]  Is going to be a lot of dirt coming out about all the dirty deals that Biden's got for his little boy, Hunter.
[02:18:37.295 --> 02:18:51.985]  And this impeachment inquiry in the process going on is going to backfire on them in a very harmful way to the Democratic Party, because it's going to show the amount of corruption that goes on.
[02:18:52.523 --> 02:18:53.664]  And all the dirty deals.
[02:18:53.704 --> 02:18:56.026]  And the same thing with the Repulsivkins, by the way.
[02:18:56.426 --> 02:19:03.651]  If you go back to all the dirty deals that happened during the Iraq war, the Afghan war, and went to the military-industrial complex.
[02:19:04.072 --> 02:19:05.713]  But this is going to make it really clear.
[02:19:05.753 --> 02:19:08.815]  So if Biden- By the way, I totally agree with you, but let me just ask this question then.
[02:19:09.216 --> 02:19:10.457]  What are the Democrats thinking?
[02:19:10.537 --> 02:19:13.899]  Where they can rig it in the House, but it's all going to come out in the Senate.
[02:19:13.979 --> 02:19:15.180]  What the hell are they thinking?
[02:19:16.281 --> 02:19:18.242]  That's why I call them the Dumbo Craps.
[02:19:18.823 --> 02:19:20.204]  What they don't understand,
[02:19:20.874 --> 02:19:22.576]  Is who they're fighting against.
[02:19:23.017 --> 02:19:24.478]  Trump is a New Yorker.
[02:19:24.819 --> 02:19:26.881]  This guy doesn't go down.
[02:19:27.502 --> 02:19:31.306]  You know, you like him, hate him, whatever he is, the dirty deals.
[02:19:31.606 --> 02:19:33.348]  He fights to the end.
[02:19:33.809 --> 02:19:37.854]  I know people that know him personally at a business level.
[02:19:38.683 --> 02:19:42.425]  This guy is, they, they totally underestimate them.
[02:19:42.465 --> 02:19:45.967]  They're a bunch of rookies in the, in the politicians.
[02:19:46.067 --> 02:19:46.367]  I agree.
[02:19:46.427 --> 02:19:51.770]  All these white shoeboys may have hijacked the country for the last 40 years, but they don't know how to fight their way up a web bigger back.
[02:19:51.790 --> 02:19:52.951]  They've never run anything real.
[02:19:53.251 --> 02:19:55.472]  They don't like to work 20 hours a day like Trump does.
[02:19:55.832 --> 02:20:01.796]  They don't get that they're also summoning the grassroots of America out of their slumber and really pissing people off.
[02:20:02.796 --> 02:20:03.637]  It's exactly it.
[02:20:03.697 --> 02:20:07.659]  Because as you point out, it's ridiculous that this is moving forward.
[02:20:08.052 --> 02:20:18.137]  Being that it's going to go into the Senate, and the Senate is already a majority Republican, they're certainly not going to get two-thirds of the votes to convict him.
[02:20:18.717 --> 02:20:23.719]  So it's a total waste of time and energy, and this is very important.
[02:20:24.359 --> 02:20:26.941]  Because, let me finish before I go into that.
[02:20:27.321 --> 02:20:30.922]  So now if Biden's not there, he's left with what?
[02:20:31.623 --> 02:20:34.464]  Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.
[02:20:34.963 --> 02:20:37.024]  They're not going to win the swing states.
[02:20:37.124 --> 02:20:38.185]  It's as simple as that.
[02:20:38.205 --> 02:20:38.465]  I agree.
[02:20:38.525 --> 02:20:39.706]  What is the point of Bloomberg?
[02:20:40.867 --> 02:20:43.268]  Bloomberg is there because of his ego.
[02:20:43.929 --> 02:20:45.810]  And he knows it clear.
[02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:49.212]  He said they don't know what it takes to beat Trump.
[02:20:50.133 --> 02:20:51.533]  And he thinks he does.
[02:20:52.014 --> 02:21:00.059]  But Bloomberg's going to go nowhere in our opinion because this stop and frisk is going to kill him, show him what a fraud he is,
[02:21:00.635 --> 02:21:03.217]  I mean, could you imagine freedom in the United States?
[02:21:03.557 --> 02:21:04.939]  You're walking down the street.
[02:21:05.179 --> 02:21:08.722]  You know, I don't like the way that black guy, that Latino looks.
[02:21:09.002 --> 02:21:09.963]  Hey, get over here.
[02:21:10.403 --> 02:21:11.344]  Put up your arms.
[02:21:11.824 --> 02:21:13.686]  Let me frisk you to see what you got.
[02:21:14.206 --> 02:21:18.470]  Over a million people, this dirty, lousy Bloomberg.
[02:21:18.490 --> 02:21:21.032]  And he wants to tell people what to eat and what to drink.
[02:21:21.092 --> 02:21:22.173]  I mean, the guy's a control freak.
[02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.691]  Exactly.
[02:21:23.971 --> 02:21:25.513]  Because he's a multi-billionaire.
[02:21:25.973 --> 02:21:27.254]  And he got the dough to do it.
[02:21:27.535 --> 02:21:39.547]  So now, like all low-life people, when they get caught, this little slimer was defending his stop-and-frisk actions until weeks before he announced his candidacy.
[02:21:39.847 --> 02:21:43.651]  And then he comes out with, well, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[02:21:43.671 --> 02:21:46.654]  Yeah, you're sorry you got caught, you gotta face up to it.
[02:21:47.210 --> 02:22:00.059]  So going back to the other ones and in the election cycle, there's nobody in that process that's going to beat Trump on the swing state issues.
[02:22:00.659 --> 02:22:01.820]  They're not going to get it.
[02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:05.282]  So that's why we're forecasting minus a wild card.
[02:22:05.702 --> 02:22:07.263]  And Trump is a wild card.
[02:22:07.283 --> 02:22:08.904]  There's a lot of wild cards out there.
[02:22:09.365 --> 02:22:10.846]  Minus a wild card is Trump 2020.
[02:22:10.926 --> 02:22:12.787]  Well, I can't wait
[02:22:12.807 --> 02:22:13.607]  Great to see your trends.
[02:22:13.627 --> 02:22:14.868]  I didn't know they were coming out tomorrow.
[02:22:15.108 --> 02:22:16.408]  This is the Alex Jones Show right now.
[02:22:16.428 --> 02:22:17.469]  This hour is as big as any hour.
[02:22:17.509 --> 02:22:21.951]  But if you've got 30 minutes to pop on tomorrow, I'd love you to come on and go over the trends with us tomorrow.
[02:22:21.971 --> 02:22:24.152]  But I know you're going to preview some of those right now.
[02:22:24.172 --> 02:22:26.032]  People should definitely visit your website.
[02:22:26.052 --> 02:22:27.673]  So, Gerald, thanks for letting me steal some of the time.
[02:22:27.713 --> 02:22:28.133]  God bless.
[02:22:28.914 --> 02:22:29.514]  Oh, thank you.
[02:22:29.574 --> 02:22:30.594]  Thank you for all that you do.
[02:22:33.395 --> 02:22:34.956]  So, here we are.
[02:22:36.157 --> 02:22:37.377]  Moving into the elections.
[02:22:38.357 --> 02:22:41.919]  It's a waste of time, as I was beginning to say with Alex.
[02:22:42.625 --> 02:22:44.966]  To keep tuning into this impeachment garbage.
[02:22:45.586 --> 02:22:47.606]  That's all you're getting from the major media.
[02:22:48.166 --> 02:22:51.147]  Let's forget about what's going on over there in France.
[02:22:52.687 --> 02:22:52.947]  Yeah.
[02:22:53.707 --> 02:22:55.348]  Oh, the girls in France.
[02:22:55.388 --> 02:22:57.408]  That was an old song when I was a young guy.
[02:22:58.969 --> 02:23:00.329]  What's going on in France?
[02:23:00.409 --> 02:23:01.929]  First, the Yellow Vest Movement.
[02:23:03.069 --> 02:23:04.270]  A year ago, November.
[02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:08.051]  And that was because they raised petrol prices.
[02:23:08.531 --> 02:23:09.871]  But that's not what it was about.
[02:23:10.506 --> 02:23:13.567]  It was about the rich getting all the dough and the people getting nothing.
[02:23:14.408 --> 02:23:17.609]  And they can't stand that arrogant Macron, the little garcon.
[02:23:18.810 --> 02:23:22.932]  So now they have a strike going on.
[02:23:22.952 --> 02:23:24.613]  300-mile backup on the roads.
[02:23:26.273 --> 02:23:27.214]  Nothing going on.
[02:23:28.354 --> 02:23:29.255]  Trains stopped.
[02:23:29.375 --> 02:23:30.335]  Only two of them running.
[02:23:31.756 --> 02:23:32.536]  Big strike.
[02:23:33.797 --> 02:23:35.998]  Picking up from where the yellow vests left off.
[02:23:36.959 --> 02:23:38.479]  People don't know what this means.
[02:23:38.799 --> 02:23:39.840]  It's bigger than France.
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:41.680]  Take a trip to Lebanon.
[02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:44.281]  All around the world.
[02:23:45.081 --> 02:23:46.621]  One place after another.
[02:23:47.601 --> 02:23:49.982]  Riots, protests, demonstrations.
[02:23:50.902 --> 02:23:51.782]  What does it mean?
[02:23:52.642 --> 02:23:53.602]  Where is it going?
[02:23:54.162 --> 02:23:54.982]  What's next?
[02:23:56.103 --> 02:23:57.503]  And that's what we're coming back to.
[02:23:58.123 --> 02:23:58.803]  What's next?
[02:23:59.503 --> 02:24:03.984]  Because this is a whole new world disorder.
[02:24:04.864 --> 02:24:07.985]  And that's one of your top trends also for 2020.
[02:24:08.045 --> 02:24:10.245]  Be right back.
[02:24:12.881 --> 02:24:14.122]  Hello, hello!
[02:24:14.402 --> 02:24:16.603]  Glad to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:17.363 --> 02:24:22.486]  So, I was just talking about what's going on in France that hardly makes the media here.
[02:24:22.506 --> 02:24:25.528]  You got over a million people taking to the streets.
[02:24:25.608 --> 02:24:26.628]  Strikes, big time.
[02:24:27.829 --> 02:24:34.412]  They call Macron, the little cotson over there, the Prime Minister or President, whatever you want to call him.
[02:24:35.473 --> 02:24:37.174]  He, uh, President, I believe.
[02:24:37.654 --> 02:24:41.336]  He's a, um, they call him arrogant.
[02:24:42.699 --> 02:24:44.621]  And disconnected to the people.
[02:24:45.241 --> 02:24:46.622]  Yeah, he's a Rothschild boy.
[02:24:47.043 --> 02:24:47.543]  That's right.
[02:24:47.623 --> 02:24:49.204]  Worked for the Rothschild Bank.
[02:24:50.065 --> 02:24:51.026]  Totally disconnected.
[02:24:52.507 --> 02:24:54.749]  And then you look at what's going on in Hong Kong.
[02:24:55.369 --> 02:24:58.872]  This weekend again, nearly a million people to the streets.
[02:24:59.253 --> 02:25:03.977]  A million people in a place is 7.5, 7 point something million people.
[02:25:04.937 --> 02:25:07.539]  In America, how many people you get out for a protest?
[02:25:07.579 --> 02:25:08.100]  A 325 million.
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:08.820]  Lucky to get a million out.
[02:25:12.790 --> 02:25:14.531]  There's no fight left back in this country.
[02:25:15.952 --> 02:25:17.874]  Then you take a look what's going on in Chile.
[02:25:18.835 --> 02:25:21.137]  Every week, more demonstrations going on.
[02:25:21.597 --> 02:25:23.598]  The billionaire running the show, Pinera.
[02:25:24.319 --> 02:25:26.621]  Yeah, not the bread company, another piece of bread.
[02:25:27.462 --> 02:25:27.742]  Yeah.
[02:25:28.943 --> 02:25:29.923]  Another billionaire.
[02:25:32.225 --> 02:25:41.973]  One country after another, Romania, Algeria, Lebanon, Bolivia, Colombia,
[02:25:42.981 --> 02:25:53.668]  Peru, Ecuador, Cameroon, Sudan, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Guinea.
[02:25:55.049 --> 02:25:57.030]  One nation after another.
[02:25:57.810 --> 02:26:03.734]  The people are revolting because it's revolting for what they're going through.
[02:26:04.735 --> 02:26:06.396]  All the money's gone to the top.
[02:26:07.185 --> 02:26:08.426]  Like the Bloomberg!
[02:26:08.686 --> 02:26:15.290]  You think Bloomberg would be anywhere if he didn't have all that dough with a personality like his?
[02:26:17.871 --> 02:26:19.092]  What is he spending?
[02:26:19.112 --> 02:26:24.535]  Depending on whose numbers you're looking at, he spent about 50 million bucks already.
[02:26:26.757 --> 02:26:30.339]  He spent more than all the Democrats have spent already.
[02:26:32.220 --> 02:26:34.101]  That's what America has turned into.
[02:26:34.775 --> 02:26:38.996]  And put a K on that, get rid of that C. It's America.
[02:26:39.656 --> 02:26:46.638]  Going back to what's going on in all these countries, they're rising up against the losses of freedom.
[02:26:46.798 --> 02:26:48.178]  Spain, that's what that's about.
[02:26:48.618 --> 02:26:50.059]  Catalonians want their freedom.
[02:26:50.419 --> 02:26:51.679]  Hong Kong, it's about freedom.
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:58.761]  Algeria and all the rest, it's about money.
[02:26:59.381 --> 02:27:00.301]  The bottom line.
[02:27:00.941 --> 02:27:03.362]  And the rich having everything and nobody else having anything.
[02:27:04.127 --> 02:27:08.168]  And you know my saying, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:27:08.749 --> 02:27:10.069]  And they're losing it big time.
[02:27:10.849 --> 02:27:15.651]  This is going to be my 40th year in the trend forecasting business.
[02:27:15.711 --> 02:27:16.531]  Began in 1980.
[02:27:19.332 --> 02:27:22.113]  Never have I seen what's going on around the world like now.
[02:27:22.813 --> 02:27:26.995]  And most people are totally disconnected.
[02:27:27.415 --> 02:27:30.436]  They're watching the impeachment stuff, talking about impeachment.
[02:27:30.796 --> 02:27:31.876]  It means nothing.
[02:27:32.817 --> 02:27:33.657]  And Trump knows it.
[02:27:36.374 --> 02:27:37.654]  But I forgot to tell Alex.
[02:27:38.795 --> 02:27:40.716]  The other reasons why Trump is going to win.
[02:27:40.736 --> 02:27:47.738]  They're going to lower interest rates to zero in negative interest rate policy by this time next year.
[02:27:47.778 --> 02:27:49.419]  So the economy will still keep going.
[02:27:50.539 --> 02:27:50.939]  Next.
[02:27:52.660 --> 02:27:53.380]  Peace treaty.
[02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:55.281]  That's right.
[02:27:55.341 --> 02:27:58.542]  With North Korea and Afghanistan.
[02:28:00.983 --> 02:28:02.323]  And a trade deal.
[02:28:03.343 --> 02:28:04.624]  It's the auditor deal.
[02:28:05.683 --> 02:28:08.844]  And Trump knows how to do it better than the rest.
[02:28:09.704 --> 02:28:10.744]  He's a pro at this.
[02:28:10.764 --> 02:28:13.985]  He's a presidential reality show champion.
[02:28:15.546 --> 02:28:17.826]  And I should say a reality show champion.
[02:28:18.346 --> 02:28:20.547]  He knows how to play the game.
[02:28:20.987 --> 02:28:23.508]  He's up against a bunch of rookies.
[02:28:23.528 --> 02:28:25.808]  And you don't believe me?
[02:28:25.868 --> 02:28:29.709]  Just watch a little bit of that freak show called the impeachment hearings.
[02:28:31.690 --> 02:28:32.850]  So that's what we're looking at.
[02:28:33.700 --> 02:28:38.742]  Now going back to what I'm talking about with all these protests going on around the world.
[02:28:40.123 --> 02:28:44.105]  You're going to start seeing violence, corruption being attacked.
[02:28:45.766 --> 02:28:46.686]  Off with their heads 2.0.
[02:28:46.786 --> 02:28:49.567]  That's going to be another trend.
[02:28:50.428 --> 02:28:52.069]  They're going to want to take out the bigs.
[02:28:52.909 --> 02:28:53.849]  At all the levels.
[02:28:55.390 --> 02:28:57.211]  I've never seen this happen before.
[02:28:57.311 --> 02:29:00.072]  The implications are going to be horrendous.
[02:29:01.073 --> 02:29:01.353]  Again.
[02:29:02.236 --> 02:29:08.439]  No one in the media is talking about this and putting it all together.
[02:29:12.180 --> 02:29:13.000]  What it means.
[02:29:14.301 --> 02:29:16.342]  What's going on and what's next.
[02:29:17.922 --> 02:29:20.823]  And the what's next are going to be horrendous.
[02:29:22.424 --> 02:29:24.305]  The world is not prepared for this.
[02:29:25.165 --> 02:29:27.186]  The governments aren't prepared for it.
[02:29:27.786 --> 02:29:29.587]  They're ignoring it around the world.
[02:29:30.214 --> 02:29:31.514]  Oh, it's only happening in France.
[02:29:31.534 --> 02:29:32.635]  It's only happening in Chile.
[02:29:32.695 --> 02:29:34.055]  It's only happening in Bolivia.
[02:29:34.355 --> 02:29:35.695]  It's only happening in Ecuador.
[02:29:35.735 --> 02:29:39.476]  It's only happening in Argentina.
[02:29:39.936 --> 02:29:41.016]  Oh yeah, their currency?
[02:29:41.777 --> 02:29:42.217]  What is it?
[02:29:42.817 --> 02:29:46.337]  Oh, it's down only 57% this year.
[02:29:46.357 --> 02:29:48.898]  Iran.
[02:29:52.639 --> 02:29:53.099]  Iraq.
[02:29:53.779 --> 02:29:55.419]  Look what's going on in Iraq.
[02:29:56.240 --> 02:29:57.160]  They killed about 500 people.
[02:29:58.703 --> 02:30:01.404]  Since the protests began in October.
[02:30:02.265 --> 02:30:03.845]  And what are they protesting against?
[02:30:04.606 --> 02:30:05.246]  Corruption?
[02:30:05.606 --> 02:30:06.166]  Violence?
[02:30:07.387 --> 02:30:08.287]  Lack of jobs?
[02:30:08.668 --> 02:30:09.848]  The elites running the show?
[02:30:09.868 --> 02:30:12.889]  Well, you know what they're not talking about in any of this?
[02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:15.571]  Who caused the problems in Iraq?
[02:30:16.531 --> 02:30:17.932]  How about the war criminals?
[02:30:18.412 --> 02:30:21.714]  The Dick Cheney and the Bush.
[02:30:22.394 --> 02:30:23.654]  Dick and Bush.
[02:30:24.255 --> 02:30:24.655]  Yeah.
[02:30:25.895 --> 02:30:26.856]  Dick and Bush.
[02:30:27.853 --> 02:30:29.254]  Light us into that war.
[02:30:29.914 --> 02:30:35.658]  Destroyed an entire nation at an estimated cost to we, the taxpayers, of trillions of dollars.
[02:30:36.799 --> 02:30:38.540]  Killed an estimated million people.
[02:30:40.341 --> 02:30:42.543]  Hey, wonder why they have radical terrorists?
[02:30:43.063 --> 02:30:44.064]  We wouldn't be radical.
[02:30:44.184 --> 02:30:55.852]  I could never imagine anyone, anyone, working with Alex Jones, InfoWars, wanting to get even
[02:30:56.607 --> 02:31:12.140]  If a foreign nation came in here, destroyed the country, turned Austin into dust, killed everybody that you love, and you have no future, oh, you wouldn't want to fight back?
[02:31:12.941 --> 02:31:13.742]  No.
[02:31:14.603 --> 02:31:16.504]  You're in for wars.
[02:31:17.105 --> 02:31:22.710]  You just keep your mouth silent and just be good little boys and good little girls.
[02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:24.351]  Of course not.
[02:31:25.094 --> 02:31:26.895]  You'd be out leading the charge.
[02:31:27.816 --> 02:31:29.157]  And that's what's going on.
[02:31:30.137 --> 02:31:31.878]  As I say, payback's a bitch.
[02:31:32.839 --> 02:31:35.781]  And you reap what you sow.
[02:31:37.662 --> 02:31:42.545]  And America, what America is sowing with these wars, we're going to be reaping.
[02:31:43.906 --> 02:31:45.647]  Terrorists, guess what?
[02:31:46.647 --> 02:31:54.192]  If you came to my country and destroyed and killed everybody I love, I'm back at you, Jack and Jill.
[02:31:55.461 --> 02:31:57.962]  Yeah, I'll attack the attacker.
[02:32:00.123 --> 02:32:08.686]  So going back to Iraq, no one's talking about why it's happening and what's going on, except to say, oh, the Iranians are influencing.
[02:32:08.746 --> 02:32:11.927]  Iran, yeah, the Iranians, they got a game, playing a game.
[02:32:12.167 --> 02:32:20.771]  But people forget that under Reagan and that other guy, Carter, they started, they planned the war, Iraq against Iran in the 1980s.
[02:32:21.031 --> 02:32:23.952]  They killed over a million Iraq, Iranians.
[02:32:25.441 --> 02:32:26.301]  So yeah, they're influenced.
[02:32:26.321 --> 02:32:27.382]  Their neighbor's over there.
[02:32:27.402 --> 02:32:28.462]  They got stuff going on.
[02:32:29.322 --> 02:32:30.382]  None of my business.
[02:32:30.502 --> 02:32:31.343]  I'm an American.
[02:32:32.543 --> 02:32:33.763]  No foreign entanglements.
[02:32:34.824 --> 02:32:38.645]  So going on around the world, the countries are not prepared for what's going on.
[02:32:38.665 --> 02:32:40.765]  The people are not going to prepare for what's going on.
[02:32:41.345 --> 02:32:43.206]  I'm going to talk more about it tomorrow.
[02:32:43.646 --> 02:32:46.227]  I'm going to try to be on InfoWars tomorrow at 12 o'clock.
[02:32:46.727 --> 02:32:50.508]  And I'm going to feed you, fill you in with more of the top trends for 2020.
[02:32:52.342 --> 02:32:58.147]  And they connect very deeply to the New World Disorder.
[02:32:58.987 --> 02:33:00.428]  And that's what we have now.
[02:33:01.569 --> 02:33:04.231]  I've never seen anything like this before.
[02:33:05.152 --> 02:33:06.653]  And one more important element.
[02:33:07.734 --> 02:33:19.843]  All of these places that I've mentioned around the world, from Zimbabwe to Chile, from Colombia to Lebanon, you know who's leading it?
[02:33:21.286 --> 02:33:22.367]  Not one leader.
[02:33:23.227 --> 02:33:25.368]  It's led by we the people.
[02:33:25.988 --> 02:33:26.529]  That's right.
[02:33:26.929 --> 02:33:29.690]  The people are in charge, not the leaders.
[02:33:30.571 --> 02:33:31.491]  So lead the way.
[02:33:31.851 --> 02:33:32.772]  You're one of the people.
[02:33:33.532 --> 02:33:33.932]  Right back.
[02:33:35.253 --> 02:33:36.153]  Hello, hello.
[02:33:36.373 --> 02:33:38.454]  Glad to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:38.495 --> 02:33:46.238]  And don't forget, it's Christmas time and time to do more to support InfoWars.
[02:33:46.699 --> 02:33:47.519]  And you can get there.

[02:34:35.782 --> 02:34:40.464]  So do what you can to keep the truth alive because, you know, one of our top trends for 2019 was censorship 2019.
[02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:47.582]  And it's gotten a lot worse everywhere.
[02:34:48.382 --> 02:34:51.344]  So do what you can to keep the truth alive.
[02:34:51.924 --> 02:34:53.105]  Support InfoWars.
[02:34:53.205 --> 02:34:55.946]  Oh, and by the way, it is Christmas time.
[02:34:56.626 --> 02:35:06.712]  And I know people talk about, you know, the, uh, Black Friday and discounts and, uh, what will retail sales be?
[02:35:07.232 --> 02:35:08.973]  But it is the birth of the Prince of Peace.
[02:35:10.274 --> 02:35:12.595]  And I am a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[02:35:14.397 --> 02:35:16.098]  And that's why I launched Occupy Peace.
[02:35:17.420 --> 02:35:18.260]  To fight evil.
[02:35:19.161 --> 02:35:20.862]  Because war is evil.
[02:35:21.863 --> 02:35:26.988]  The wars that we have, this is not in the doctrine of the Prince of Peace.
[02:35:27.708 --> 02:35:34.074]  So during this holiday season, may you consider a gift of peace by going to Occupy Peace.
[02:35:34.894 --> 02:35:41.640]  Because the more peace money that we get, the more we can do to change the tide.
[02:35:42.964 --> 02:35:47.766]  And we will not elevate to a higher society in a state of war and terror.
[02:35:48.927 --> 02:35:51.408]  You can't be creative in that kind of atmosphere.
[02:35:51.928 --> 02:35:53.709]  And you can see it going down around us.
[02:35:54.209 --> 02:35:57.170]  How we've declined since the war on terror began.
[02:35:57.190 --> 02:36:01.012]  And the Trends Journal, by the way, is a weekly.
[02:36:01.652 --> 02:36:03.833]  Went from a quarterly to a monthly to a weekly.
[02:36:03.853 --> 02:36:06.455]  I was just working on it before I got on the air.
[02:36:07.195 --> 02:36:08.415]  It goes out tomorrow.
[02:36:08.435 --> 02:36:11.677]  And I was writing about
[02:36:12.247 --> 02:36:21.292]  What happened in Afghanistan when the United States declared war against it under George criminal, war criminal Bush.
[02:36:22.193 --> 02:36:24.714]  And again, he lied us into the Iraq war.
[02:36:25.094 --> 02:36:27.395]  And a lot of us knew it was a lie when it was going on.
[02:36:28.916 --> 02:36:30.037]  The story's right there.
[02:36:31.818 --> 02:36:34.259]  First, it was to get that Osama bin Laden.
[02:36:34.839 --> 02:36:39.042]  And then it became, we got to bring freedom and democracy to the Afghan people.
[02:36:39.062 --> 02:36:40.443]  18 years of war.
[02:36:41.843 --> 02:36:42.784]  Keeps going on.
[02:36:42.804 --> 02:36:45.065]  Of course, we, the taxpayer, are trillions.
[02:36:45.886 --> 02:36:48.448]  And with all the wars we're fighting, killing millions.
[02:36:48.528 --> 02:36:53.072]  So, that is not what I believe in, the Prince of Peace.
[02:36:53.852 --> 02:37:02.459]  And as a Catholic, I like to hear the Pope come out and all these Catholic priests come out and start preaching what the Prince of Peace preaches.
[02:37:03.399 --> 02:37:03.720]  Peace.
[02:37:04.460 --> 02:37:05.901]  But I don't hear it coming from them.
[02:37:06.562 --> 02:37:07.322]  So, where are they?
[02:37:08.703 --> 02:37:09.744]  Anyway, moving on.
[02:37:10.104 --> 02:37:10.705]  The economy.
[02:37:11.232 --> 02:37:12.712]  I'm talking about what's going on globally.
[02:37:12.732 --> 02:37:14.513]  There's a global economic slowdown.
[02:37:15.253 --> 02:37:24.756]  America's picking up because the Trump tax cuts really boosted the economy in a lot of ways, but it didn't really boost real wages.
[02:37:25.937 --> 02:37:28.157]  But we have the multinationals just doing fine.
[02:37:28.177 --> 02:37:34.119]  They're still turning out the dough as everybody becomes a plantation worker in slavelandia.
[02:37:36.100 --> 02:37:37.660]  The economy in America is stronger.
[02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:39.581]  We have interest rates that could go lower.
[02:37:40.213 --> 02:37:42.594]  When you go around the world, they can't lower them anymore.
[02:37:43.194 --> 02:37:44.034]  So what are they doing?
[02:37:44.654 --> 02:37:54.778]  Well, over there in Japan, they're dumping in a couple of hundred billion dollars into fiscal spending.
[02:37:56.158 --> 02:37:56.998]  It's not going to work.
[02:37:57.578 --> 02:38:00.499]  They got a debt to GDP ratio of about 256.
[02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:03.800]  America's is under 100.
[02:38:04.781 --> 02:38:05.841]  China's is over 300.
[02:38:06.021 --> 02:38:08.842]  Debt to GDP ratio, gross domestic product.
[02:38:10.026 --> 02:38:10.526]  India!
[02:38:11.887 --> 02:38:15.209]  Car sales down in India this year, 25% for the whole year.
[02:38:15.749 --> 02:38:18.150]  Over 100,000 workers have lost their jobs.
[02:38:18.951 --> 02:38:22.973]  Over in Europe, 50,000 autoworkers lost their jobs.
[02:38:25.975 --> 02:38:26.895]  These are real numbers.
[02:38:28.796 --> 02:38:29.777]  Go back to India.
[02:38:30.217 --> 02:38:30.877]  Trade war?
[02:38:31.177 --> 02:38:32.478]  Nothing to do with a trade war.
[02:38:33.579 --> 02:38:37.861]  The phony economies that they juiced up are slowing down.
[02:38:38.851 --> 02:38:40.752]  There's a global economic slowdown.
[02:38:41.012 --> 02:38:44.533]  Hey, south of the border, down Mexico way.
[02:38:45.753 --> 02:38:46.853]  Recession.
[02:38:49.354 --> 02:38:50.794]  Nothing to do with a trade war.
[02:38:53.395 --> 02:38:58.897]  Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Brazil.
[02:38:58.917 --> 02:39:01.638]  Yeah, Brazil's popping up a little bit.
[02:39:04.558 --> 02:39:06.319]  It's one country after another.
[02:39:07.841 --> 02:39:09.761]  There's a global economic slowdown.
[02:39:11.642 --> 02:39:13.862]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:39:14.742 --> 02:39:15.802]  I mentioned about India.
[02:39:16.383 --> 02:39:17.023]  What's going on?
[02:39:17.043 --> 02:39:22.404]  Remember they annexed, they took away the autonomy, the semi-autonomous place of Kashmir?
[02:39:23.684 --> 02:39:30.745]  And the Pakistanis are fighting for that as well, because they say they own half of it, or whatever they want to make up, any of them.
[02:39:32.726 --> 02:39:34.666]  So as economies go down,
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:38.101]  War talk is going to heat up.
[02:39:40.263 --> 02:39:46.247]  I was just with a woman at a wonderful Latin jazz festival that her son put on.
[02:39:46.707 --> 02:39:47.888]  She's 89 years old.
[02:39:50.130 --> 02:39:57.075]  And she moved to, her and her husband from New York, they moved to England right after World War II.
[02:39:58.476 --> 02:40:01.278]  And she told me how bombed out the place was and how poor the people were.
[02:40:03.159 --> 02:40:04.440]  That's not ancient history.
[02:40:05.131 --> 02:40:06.452]  We're talking 1946-47.
[02:40:06.612 --> 02:40:09.594]  I'm born in 46.
[02:40:13.596 --> 02:40:21.601]  And then I was with somebody the other night from Holland and telling me what her grandparents were telling her when the Nazis invaded and occupied.
[02:40:21.641 --> 02:40:23.543]  Think about it.
[02:40:25.164 --> 02:40:33.509]  The most advanced civilizations at the time, Germany, France, England, Netherlands,
[02:40:34.744 --> 02:40:35.284]  Norway.
[02:40:36.064 --> 02:40:36.584]  Sweden.
[02:40:38.185 --> 02:40:39.685]  These aren't backwater places.
[02:40:42.186 --> 02:40:42.686]  Bombed.
[02:40:43.206 --> 02:40:43.906]  Occupied.
[02:40:45.026 --> 02:40:45.746]  In war.
[02:40:46.346 --> 02:40:47.947]  That's not ancient history.
[02:40:49.527 --> 02:40:54.788]  If we don't stop what's going on now, this will be the beginning of the Third World War.
[02:40:56.529 --> 02:41:03.250]  They asked Einstein, how will the Third World War be fought?
[02:41:04.343 --> 02:41:05.044]  He said, I don't know.
[02:41:05.924 --> 02:41:11.188]  He said, but the Fourth World War will be fought with sticks and stones.
[02:41:11.729 --> 02:41:21.596]  In 2000, I was asked to be the keynote speaker at Virginia Military Institute to talk about new millennium warfare to the generals.
[02:41:21.736 --> 02:41:24.318]  Matter of fact, I met General Anthony Zinni.
[02:41:24.338 --> 02:41:25.399]  We stayed in contact.
[02:41:28.922 --> 02:41:34.226]  Anthony Zinni was the general that was the number two guy running the first Gulf War.
[02:41:39.736 --> 02:41:41.797]  I'm asked to talk about New Millennium Warfare.
[02:41:42.617 --> 02:41:44.898]  Generals are always fighting the last war.
[02:41:46.659 --> 02:41:49.680]  And that's what America's fighting now with these aircraft carriers.
[02:41:50.180 --> 02:41:51.641]  And these F-35s.
[02:41:52.461 --> 02:41:53.542]  Wasting our money.
[02:41:53.702 --> 02:41:55.522]  F-you-know-what-35s.
[02:41:57.923 --> 02:41:59.244]  Hypersonic weapons.
[02:41:59.404 --> 02:42:00.364]  Cyber wars.
[02:42:03.706 --> 02:42:04.786]  Chemical warfare.
[02:42:05.794 --> 02:42:13.258]  Imagine ten thousands or thousands of drones flying over with weapons of mass destruction.
[02:42:13.758 --> 02:42:16.500]  You're not going to blow these things out of the air.
[02:42:18.581 --> 02:42:28.686]  Remember, sophisticated societies were destroyed 75 years ago.
[02:42:29.886 --> 02:42:32.328]  The most sophisticated societies on the planet.
[02:42:33.848 --> 02:42:35.009]  It was in ancient history.
[02:42:36.161 --> 02:42:42.830]  So we have to stop this march to war and have parades for peace.
[02:42:44.032 --> 02:42:45.935]  Because if we don't, this thing is going down.
[02:42:45.995 --> 02:42:50.782]  I'm giving you the economic numbers and showing you what's going on all around the country.
[02:42:51.963 --> 02:42:53.185]  Excuse me, all around the world.
[02:42:54.278 --> 02:42:56.459]  Because it's going down big.
[02:42:56.879 --> 02:43:06.502]  Gerald, I totally agree with you and you're out of time today, but you've been gracious enough with your big report that everybody always waits on to join me tomorrow at noon central, 1 p.m.
[02:43:06.582 --> 02:43:06.962]  Eastern.
[02:43:07.502 --> 02:43:14.184]  So thank you so much for hosting the last 40 minutes or so and I really look forward to you being on in the second hour tomorrow.
[02:43:14.224 --> 02:43:15.485]  TrendsResearch.com.
[02:43:15.525 --> 02:43:16.025]  Thank you, Gerald.
[02:43:16.752 --> 02:43:17.373]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:43:27.546 --> 02:43:33.968]  Owen Troyer's show after what he just did in Congress today with Savannah Hernandez in like two minutes.
[02:43:34.008 --> 02:43:35.329]  I'm going to walk over to the other studio.
[02:43:36.249 --> 02:43:36.889]  The War Room.
[02:43:36.949 --> 02:43:40.050]  Infowars.com forward slash show and band dot video.
[02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:45.252]  We're going to look at the IG report, Barr's response, Durham's response, and so much more.
[02:43:45.312 --> 02:43:47.272]  And Durham is actually bucking it.
[02:43:47.553 --> 02:43:48.613]  So hopefully this is for real.
[02:43:48.653 --> 02:43:49.133]  We'll see.
[02:43:49.153 --> 02:43:50.413]  I'm not going to hold my breath.
[02:43:50.454 --> 02:43:50.934]  Stay with us.
[02:43:50.974 --> 02:43:51.734]  War Room coming up.
[02:44:04.793 --> 02:44:08.574]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[02:44:09.095 --> 02:44:12.336]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[02:44:12.576 --> 02:44:15.257]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[02:44:15.857 --> 02:44:18.718]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[02:44:19.398 --> 02:44:21.119]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:44:21.639 --> 02:44:23.060]  I suggest Band.Video.
[02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:28.825]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:44:29.205 --> 02:44:37.133]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:44:37.674 --> 02:44:45.241]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[02:44:45.541 --> 02:44:47.203]  Be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[02:44:55.419 --> 02:45:02.641]  Black Friday continues at InfoWarsTore.com
[02:45:23.916 --> 02:45:33.446]  There's a reason that nutritional supplements are the fastest growing industry, not just in the United States, not just in Europe, but all over the world.
[02:45:34.447 --> 02:45:39.452]  Because the power of Mother Nature that God gave us is simply incredible.
[02:45:40.093 --> 02:45:44.137]  Now, a lot of viewers have noted that I'm more focused.
[02:45:45.216 --> 02:45:51.104]  That the broadcast had been better than they'd ever been, and a lot of people noticed that I look younger and I've lost a lot of weight.
[02:45:51.245 --> 02:45:59.737]  Well, you remember just three months ago I said on air that when I do take the supplements from InfoWars Life,
[02:46:01.348 --> 02:46:13.656]  I lose weight, I have more stamina, more energy, more libido, and then I tend to get back in better shape, and then forget about the supplements, even though that's how we fund our operation, and I stop taking the majority of them.
[02:46:14.397 --> 02:46:25.344]  A lot of times, family comes to town for Thanksgiving, and we take the Lazy Susan off the dining table, and then I forget to put it back, and literally, six months later, I'm like, wait, I'm not really taking many of the supplements.
[02:46:26.524 --> 02:46:29.967]  It's when I religiously take our flagship products,
[02:46:31.022 --> 02:46:32.604]  So many great things happen.
[02:46:33.285 --> 02:46:50.005]  So I'm launching for this Black Friday week, and as long as we're able to do this while supplies last, because one of these is not stocked up as much as it should be, I'm going to offer this special that I've named the Change Your Life Trifecta Pack.
[02:46:50.846 --> 02:46:50.986]  Now,
[02:46:52.537 --> 02:46:56.179]  We've got the great BrainPill Nootropic BrainForce Plus.
[02:46:56.279 --> 02:47:01.902]  We've got the great Triiodine with the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and two other types to help absorb it.
[02:47:03.363 --> 02:47:07.865]  That's X3 together with this product.
[02:47:09.697 --> 02:47:22.780]  I believe is one of our very best products and that I actually had our designers put together because products like this are the best-selling systems in the world right now and the fastest growing.
[02:47:23.821 --> 02:47:29.362]  So let me show you what's in the 8-pack PowerStack AM PM system.
[02:47:31.325 --> 02:47:32.546]  Look at all of these packets.
[02:47:33.686 --> 02:47:36.727]  13 different pills that you take in the a.m.
[02:47:37.267 --> 02:47:37.928]  and the p.m.
[02:47:38.508 --> 02:47:41.469]  and then this way you don't forget.
[02:47:42.290 --> 02:47:47.912]  So that's why I'm calling this the change your life trifecta pack because if you take
[02:47:49.124 --> 02:47:56.445]  The morning pack and the evening pack, this alone is simply amazing and has changed my life.
[02:47:56.705 --> 02:48:10.028]  All the different supplements that are in it, what they do for you, what they do for your health, what they do as antioxidants, what the fish oil does, what the nootropic does, what the detox does, what the energy does.
[02:48:10.268 --> 02:48:11.108]  It's just insane.
[02:48:11.608 --> 02:48:16.449]  It's insane if you take these 13 pills a day, what Mother Nature has put together.
[02:48:16.689 --> 02:48:17.109]  Because listen,
[02:48:18.885 --> 02:48:24.660]  The top selling packs out there may have $10 a product in it that you take in a month.
[02:48:25.342 --> 02:48:26.625]  This has close to $30.
[02:48:28.976 --> 02:48:38.660]  We went out to the top manufacturer of organic supplements, and we have the Daytime Pack and the Nighttime Pack, and we put almost $30 of product into this.
[02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:42.702]  And so this special right now is at cost, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:43.142 --> 02:48:50.085]  You get the Brain Force Plus, you get the Survival Shield X3, and you get the 8-pack Power Stack, all
[02:48:51.065 --> 02:48:54.707]  For $59.95, that's at more than half off.
[02:48:54.947 --> 02:48:56.929]  This is more than a $120 value.
[02:48:57.409 --> 02:48:59.990]  When you put it all together, we are giving this to you at cost.
[02:49:00.090 --> 02:49:07.455]  Even though the X3 and the BrainForce Plus are really huge sellers, this seller that I thought would be our top seller has not sold well.
[02:49:07.975 --> 02:49:12.238]  But it's game changing and the highest quality supplements you're going to find anywhere.
[02:49:12.538 --> 02:49:14.019]  No one that I know of has ever put out
[02:49:14.719 --> 02:49:16.800]  A daytime, nighttime pack with this type of quality.
[02:49:17.220 --> 02:49:18.301]  This will blow you away.
[02:49:18.401 --> 02:49:19.382]  This will change your life.
[02:49:19.742 --> 02:49:20.742]  All three of these together.
[02:49:21.083 --> 02:49:22.563]  It's incredible and it funds our operation.
[02:49:35.831 --> 02:49:37.892]  Language is being destroyed.
[02:49:38.692 --> 02:49:40.073]  Reduced right in front of us.
[02:49:41.678 --> 02:49:48.600]  Every form of real diversity is under assault by the supposed keepers of diversity.
[02:49:49.700 --> 02:50:06.845]  Every Hollywood film, every major publication that's being promoted by the establishment is putting out a self-loathing, a orthodox hatred for humanity and our potential, so that we are psychically wounded
[02:50:07.745 --> 02:50:13.869]  With self-hate so that we will give up on ourselves, crawl into a ditch, and die as a culture.
[02:50:15.230 --> 02:50:27.658]  This is all being done in the name of saving the Earth because humans are a form of cancer on the planet and have to be culled, like you give a body radiation to supposedly stop cancer.
[02:50:27.718 --> 02:50:37.585]  But the globalists themselves, in their own internal publications, many of which have leaked, believe that the planet itself is going to be overwritten
[02:50:38.339 --> 02:50:41.900]  By the new technologies they are supposedly developing.
[02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:45.781]  What we're dealing with is psychotic mad scientists.
[02:50:46.621 --> 02:50:54.383]  And every action they take is simply a nihilistic search for more power and more control.
[02:50:55.123 --> 02:51:01.184]  And the ultimate power is controlling the minds of fellow humans on this planet and playing God.
[02:51:01.725 --> 02:51:07.146]  And building systems of surveillance that create an artificial form of omnipresence.
[02:51:12.044 --> 02:51:12.627]  I'm good.
