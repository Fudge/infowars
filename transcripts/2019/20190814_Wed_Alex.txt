[00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:23.349]  Hello, hello.
[00:00:23.549 --> 00:00:24.009]  Welcome.
[00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:25.510]  My name is Will Johnson.
[00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.592]  I'm sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.772 --> 00:00:31.355]  He's on vacation, but he is never on vacation.
[00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:34.197]  He will be joining us after this first segment.
[00:00:35.338 --> 00:00:37.520]  Veritas released another video.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.142]  Alex is going to get into that with more detail.
[00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:43.958]  I believe Keith is going to be on with him.
[00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:49.922]  You know, Google, with the censorship, the way they're attacking conservatives is unbelievable.
[00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.683]  The craziness that's going on.
[00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:57.266]  And we're supposed to just go along with it because it's supposed to be fair that they can attack conservatives.
[00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:01.649]  And liberals are supposed to get everything that they ask for.
[00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.790]  Nothing's ever supposed to happen to liberals.
[00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.871]  Only conservatives.
[00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:06.612]  And when it happens to liberals, then they
[00:01:07.472 --> 00:01:08.472]  Cry foul!
[00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.814]  So like I said, Alex will be joining us after this first segment.
[00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:18.397]  So I have the honor and the privilege to host his first five minutes before he comes on with us.
[00:01:18.597 --> 00:01:19.257]  Let me say this.
[00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:34.619]  Every day I walk into the studio and I see all of the people working so hard against the tyranny of the left, against the tyranny of the globalists, and it just makes me think that all of these people are on the same page and they understand.
[00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.982]  They are awake to what is actually happening here.
[00:01:39.823 --> 00:01:44.307]  And Alex Jones has created something that is completely remarkable.
[00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:47.850]  And every time I walk in, like I said, I'm at awe.
[00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:53.313]  People understand that Alex Jones is doing everything he can.
[00:01:53.373 --> 00:01:59.156]  He's putting everything on the line to wake up people and to fight for humanity.
[00:01:59.676 --> 00:02:13.123]  And for me, that is a great honor to be sitting here to try to represent the best of my ability and show my appreciation and say that, you know, InfoWars is a wonderful opportunity for anybody.
[00:02:14.103 --> 00:02:26.250]  I'm glad to be here to be able to guest host, but let me say this because Alex, he did a commercial spot talking about he doesn't like the plug, but I understand why he does the plugs.
[00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.393]  It's because that is the reason he does the plugs because it gives us the opportunity to be here.
[00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:33.914]  It gives me the opportunity to be here.
[00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:39.537]  Without you supporting InfoWars against what the left is doing, it doesn't happen.
[00:02:40.407 --> 00:02:44.452]  We don't have someone in the pocket like George Soros or Tom Steyer.
[00:02:44.752 --> 00:02:48.217]  All of these filthy rich billionaires just trying to take out America.
[00:02:48.978 --> 00:02:51.260]  Alex is depending on the American people.
[00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:53.824]  He's depending on all of us to step up.
[00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:57.048]  And to support InfoWars.com.
[00:02:57.608 --> 00:03:01.690]  And when you share the articles, you tell them that you're not taking it lying down.
[00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.030]  You're not going to take it any longer.
[00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:13.274]  By you going to InfoWarsStore.com, you show everybody that you love everything that Alex Jones is doing, and you don't believe the lies that's coming out of the left.
[00:03:13.914 --> 00:03:18.156]  That's what it comes down to, is if you believe the lies, then don't buy anything.
[00:03:18.676 --> 00:03:30.301]  But if you believe in humanity, you believe in this country, and you believe everything that Alex Jones has been doing here, then you need to go to Infowarsstore.com and buy the product.
[00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:37.605]  The Turbo Force, the Brain Force, the DNA Force, they're always doing specials that's unbelievable.
[00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:42.527]  Have you ever seen anyone that's doing a special on their products constantly?
[00:03:43.976 --> 00:03:50.713]  And the main reason why they're doing it is because it gives people the opportunity to find out how good the products really are.
[00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:52.277]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:59.706]  Okay, so Project Veritas, they've been trying to take out InfoWars for the longest, and I'm talking about Google.
[00:04:00.426 --> 00:04:04.528]  Google, Facebook, Twitter, they have to take out Alex Jones.
[00:04:04.668 --> 00:04:04.988]  Why?
[00:04:05.408 --> 00:04:06.769]  Because he's speaking the truth.
[00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:14.772]  You can't have someone running around, you can't have someone broadcasting, telling the truth to the American people when they have a completely different agenda.
[00:04:15.513 --> 00:04:16.213]  How does that work?
[00:04:17.577 --> 00:04:19.859]  So after the break, they're going to play a video.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.981]  And Alex is going to be on with this.
[00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:23.502]  After the break, they're going to play a video.
[00:04:23.743 --> 00:04:28.507]  And if I'm not mistaken, with the Veritas and with another Google Insider.
[00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:33.031]  And what happened here, I'm not going to break all of it out.
[00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:34.152]  I'm going to let Alex do it.
[00:04:34.652 --> 00:04:41.298]  But everything that's taking place here should be an alarm, a wake, a waking call for everybody.
[00:04:41.438 --> 00:04:41.859]  Sound the alarm!
[00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:42.640]  Sound the alarm!
[00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:50.607]  Because if we don't pay attention to what's actually happening here, every last one of us that think we have freedoms, they're gonna go away.
[00:04:51.288 --> 00:04:52.188]  You're not gonna even have freedoms.
[00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.771]  You're gonna wake up tomorrow, you're gonna be like, what in the world happened?
[00:04:55.071 --> 00:04:55.852]  No one told me!
[00:04:56.052 --> 00:04:59.655]  And it's not that anyone told you, because Alex has been telling you, you need to wake up to it.
[00:05:00.036 --> 00:05:03.979]  We'll be back after this.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.362]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor.
[00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:09.705]  But I still need my morning coffee.
[00:05:10.993 --> 00:05:19.580]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:31.350]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.234]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[00:05:37.154 --> 00:05:40.357]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[00:05:41.178 --> 00:05:46.263]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[00:05:48.084 --> 00:05:50.186]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[00:05:51.007 --> 00:06:00.716]  Sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:15.044]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:24.287]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this global Wednesday edition.
[00:06:25.007 --> 00:06:28.688]  Will Johnson is here visiting InfoWars and guest hosting.
[00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:33.369]  He's going to be hosting throughout the next four hours with many special guests.
[00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:39.811]  James O'Keefe of Project Veritas is set to drop massive new bombshells
[00:06:40.663 --> 00:06:52.713]  Exclusively here coming up on air at the bottom of the hour because he always gives us even more information than what's in his latest report with major executives inside big tech.
[00:06:53.874 --> 00:07:00.420]  Coming out and exposing whistleblowing and more that will also tie into stories.
[00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:12.528]  Up on DrudgeReport.com, TechLash, Only Making Facebook Stronger, FTC Helping Dominate, Platform Paid Contractors Transcribe Users' Audio Chats.
[00:07:13.128 --> 00:07:14.990]  They're recording everything.
[00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.431]  The sky is the limit.
[00:07:17.131 --> 00:07:18.612]  It's absolutely evil.
[00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:20.653]  It's beyond the left.
[00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:21.634]  It's authoritarianism.
[00:07:21.654 --> 00:07:27.678]  And of course, to rein in Trump in his trade war with China, the globals are allied with,
[00:07:28.243 --> 00:07:36.026]  The last four heads of the private Federal Reserve New York Board of Governors came out and said, we're going to crash the economy to teach Trump a lesson.
[00:07:36.066 --> 00:07:36.986]  He's being political.
[00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:39.547]  Well, China's being totally political with their currency.
[00:07:40.047 --> 00:07:41.588]  Trump's barely even countered them.
[00:07:42.468 --> 00:07:46.990]  Because he lifted a shield against it, they're trying to destroy the stock market right now.
[00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.191]  Yields, flash, recession, warning.
[00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:50.711]  Stocks dive.
[00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:52.992]  Banks hammered, reads Drudge's report.
[00:07:53.492 --> 00:07:55.573]  It tells you everything you need to know up above it in the left-hand corner.
[00:07:56.273 --> 00:07:57.414]  Dim contenders.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.002]  Trump 2020 Rust Belt pitch threatened by manufacturing downturn.
[00:08:03.923 --> 00:08:05.563]  What did Bill Maher say last year?
[00:08:06.344 --> 00:08:12.966]  He said, I want to crash the markets, the economy, to teach these Trump supporters a lesson.
[00:08:13.287 --> 00:08:14.667]  You can't have your country back.
[00:08:15.087 --> 00:08:16.228]  You can't have prosperity.
[00:08:16.248 --> 00:08:20.050]  No, no, everything's got to go to China, you dirty Americans.
[00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.911]  We're going to teach you.
[00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:27.653]  Also ginormous developments on the Trump front.
[00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:36.966]  With the fact that he's coming in to go after the censorship, and then even bigger developments on the Epstein House of Cards coming down.
[00:08:37.967 --> 00:08:41.228]  And just the fact that no one's buying the official story.
[00:08:42.008 --> 00:08:46.229]  And you've got the head of the jail removed, the guards, special guards were brought in.
[00:08:46.589 --> 00:08:48.250]  They heard him screaming for his life.
[00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.491]  And then they say, breathe, breathe.
[00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:53.491]  It's all coming up today.
[00:08:53.551 --> 00:08:55.352]  James O'Keefe, bottom of the hour, but hosting.
[00:08:56.258 --> 00:09:04.243]  Until the bottom of the hour, the rest of this segment and the next is Will Johnson, visiting guest host.
[00:09:04.643 --> 00:09:09.766]  And then I'll be back, co-host with Will, at the bottom of the hour with James O'Keefe.
[00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:14.068]  Remember, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:20.852]  And we had to end the big store-wide mega-sale, 50-60% off, because so many things were about to sell out.
[00:09:21.832 --> 00:09:31.940]  But we are still extending storewide free shipping, and we're still extending double Patriot points, and we're still extending sales on everything else that we have decent supplies of.
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.583]  And so it's basically 90% of the last sale.
[00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:37.584]  For each item you're getting, it's the same.
[00:09:37.604 --> 00:09:38.665]  We're keeping Krill oil.
[00:09:38.685 --> 00:09:39.846]  It just came back in last week.
[00:09:40.907 --> 00:09:42.308]  It's so popular to have the highest quality.
[00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:45.931]  It's 50% off, despite the fact that we've already sold a third of it.
[00:09:46.311 --> 00:09:47.292]  So I promise you,
[00:09:48.194 --> 00:09:54.396]  The krill oil will be taken off sale by the weekend because we have to because it will be another three months till more comes in.
[00:09:54.837 --> 00:09:56.437]  We're trying to double our order of it.
[00:09:56.957 --> 00:10:03.100]  It's so popular now because all the stuff in the news about how good it is and everybody heard me already tell you that years ago and now here it is.
[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.901]  But if you want to have amazing dreams, not just for your heart or your brain,
[00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:08.179]  Yeah, it's an honor to be here, Alex.
[00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:11.140]  You know, I'm really interested to see the interview with Veritas at the bottom of the hour and with you coming on.
[00:10:30.965 --> 00:10:36.729]  It's just so, so amazing the time that we're living in to see all of this take place.
[00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:49.497]  You know, I really want to talk about and get into how the left is still pushing the whole white supremacist and how they're continuing on to try to demonize President Trump or anybody white who supports President Trump.
[00:10:50.077 --> 00:10:57.022]  That's the thing, and it really runs through me, runs through me because we have people
[00:10:58.118 --> 00:10:59.619]  Believe in this nonsense.
[00:10:59.939 --> 00:11:06.204]  You know, no one was calling President Trump a white supremacist before he ran for president, before he went down the escalator.
[00:11:06.664 --> 00:11:12.449]  Once he went down, then all of a sudden he became racist, he became all of these things that he never was before.
[00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:16.292]  You have black hip-hop stars saying they want to be like Trump.
[00:11:16.612 --> 00:11:18.954]  You have many people saying they want to be like Trump.
[00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:30.472]  So, you know, with all of this taking place right now, because 2020 is coming up, they have to do something to get people, black people, not to vote for President Trump.
[00:11:31.132 --> 00:11:32.652]  See, that's the whole thing.
[00:11:32.672 --> 00:11:47.955]  And for the life of me, I don't understand how they're able to get so many people to be so naive to believe that all of a sudden, because they've been saying it, that President Trump is now a white supremacist, or he supports white supremacy.
[00:11:48.655 --> 00:11:49.896]  You know, it's ridiculous.
[00:11:49.936 --> 00:11:53.118]  So even Bernie Sanders, this is going to be number clip.
[00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:54.539]  Do we have time for this?
[00:11:54.719 --> 00:11:57.221]  This is clip number eight.
[00:11:57.982 --> 00:12:05.187]  Clip number eight, where Bernie Sanders, he came out and said that, OK, let me just read it to you, because this was on his tweet.
[00:12:05.327 --> 00:12:15.574]  He said, do you think it's a coincidence that the racist manifesto of the El Paso shooter echoes Trump's language of invasion and infestation of immigrants?
[00:12:16.375 --> 00:12:18.056]  Bernie Sanders is going to say, I don't.
[00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:26.888]  Then he replies, then he does, at real Donald Trump, is fanning the flames of white supremacy.
[00:12:27.008 --> 00:12:27.969]  We must stop him.
[00:12:28.469 --> 00:12:39.259]  If anyone is fanning the flames of white supremacy, if anyone is doing the white supremacy, keeping this whole racial division going, it is the liberal left.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:44.444]  So if we can go to that video, this is number eight, number eight on the chart.
[00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:53.032]  I am concerned about the rise of any group of hate.
[00:12:53.152 --> 00:12:57.493]  Whether it's white supremacy, I am very concerned about it.
[00:12:58.613 --> 00:13:00.314]  He's a savage killer.
[00:13:01.074 --> 00:13:07.836]  My administration believes our city should be safe havens for Americans, not sanctuaries for criminals.
[00:13:11.517 --> 00:13:13.497]  So, let me break in.
[00:13:13.517 --> 00:13:15.258]  Pause it real quick, right there.
[00:13:16.229 --> 00:13:21.497]  For some reason when President Trump said it should be sanctuary for Americans and not criminals,
[00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:25.860]  And they're suggesting that he's a white supremacist for saying that.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.220]  Do you see the disconnect?
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.981]  Do you see how people are not realizing that they're being blatantly lied to?
[00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:35.242]  I mean, it's right there.
[00:13:35.662 --> 00:13:36.802]  How is it possible?
[00:13:37.042 --> 00:13:52.005]  Another prime example is when President Trump said black people living in these rat-infested cities like Baltimore, all of a sudden you have people saying that President Trump is being racist because he's telling black people, you don't have to live this way.
[00:13:52.866 --> 00:13:54.290]  Is anyone else okay with that?
[00:13:54.471 --> 00:13:55.133]  I don't think so.
[00:13:55.715 --> 00:13:56.537]  Okay, let's go back to it.
[00:13:59.122 --> 00:14:06.566]  If you listen to the rhetoric from the president, you would think that every person of color is somehow a gang member or ready to rape and to kill and to plunder.
[00:14:06.686 --> 00:14:08.267]  And that's simply not the case.
[00:14:08.387 --> 00:14:09.647]  But it's good politically, however.
[00:14:09.667 --> 00:14:14.790]  It's very useful for autocrats to demonize and project all these social ills upon the other.
[00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:19.452]  When you have 15,000 people marching up, you have two or three border security people.
[00:14:19.492 --> 00:14:20.853]  How do you stop these people?
[00:14:21.593 --> 00:14:22.033]  You can't.
[00:14:22.474 --> 00:14:22.874]  There's no...
[00:14:26.863 --> 00:14:30.007]  That's only in the panhandle, you can get away with that statement.
[00:14:30.027 --> 00:14:30.447]  Okay, pause it.
[00:14:31.128 --> 00:14:43.562]  So the gentleman before that said that President Trump is using this, calling all black people, people of color, rapists and thugs and terrorists or, you know, criminals.
[00:14:44.738 --> 00:14:54.289]  When President Trump was referring to the people that's coming across the border that's taking our children, that's causing all this violence, he's talking about MS-13, he's talking about these gangs.
[00:14:54.870 --> 00:15:00.257]  They know very well who President Trump is referring to, but they take it and they spin it.
[00:15:00.757 --> 00:15:09.542]  And they're talking about, well, President Trump does this because it's very good politically for him to do this, to try to drum up his base, to try to drum up support, because people want to hear this.
[00:15:09.902 --> 00:15:14.824]  No one wants the chaos that's happening on the border to be taking place at all, except for the left.
[00:15:15.105 --> 00:15:23.129]  The only people that gain, or the only people that stand to benefit from the chaos that's happening on the border and across America,
[00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:24.569]  Is the left.
[00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.711]  Because without the chaos, the left has nothing.
[00:15:27.971 --> 00:15:33.593]  That's the only reason why they keep talking about racism, white supremacy, division in this country.
[00:15:34.154 --> 00:15:36.295]  Because without that, they have nothing.
[00:15:37.215 --> 00:15:37.735]  Nothing!
[00:15:39.176 --> 00:15:39.756]  Nothing!
[00:15:40.416 --> 00:15:41.337]  But they keep doing it.
[00:15:41.757 --> 00:15:42.357]  Over and over.
[00:15:42.857 --> 00:15:44.118]  My name is Will Johnson.
[00:15:44.998 --> 00:15:46.319]  I am sitting in for Alex.
[00:15:46.599 --> 00:15:48.500]  He will be back at the bottom of the hour.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.660]  Please stay tuned.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.821]  We got a lot more coming.
[00:16:02.708 --> 00:16:02.908]  Hi.
[00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.832]  InfoWar.
[00:16:09.373 --> 00:16:12.735]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:16:13.015 --> 00:16:16.157]  The British ended up being the most powerful empire in the world.
[00:16:16.277 --> 00:16:17.698]  Not because the Spanish couldn't fight.
[00:16:17.778 --> 00:16:19.319]  Not because the Portuguese couldn't fight.
[00:16:19.419 --> 00:16:21.941]  Not because the Austrian-Hungarian Empire couldn't fight.
[00:16:22.001 --> 00:16:24.203]  You ever wonder why British are called limeys?
[00:16:24.523 --> 00:16:26.885]  The British ended up getting basically key limes.
[00:16:27.805 --> 00:16:44.835]  When they went into the Caribbean 500 years ago, and they had their captains right, and their ship's doctors, how long sailors survived, what climates they were trying to figure out, what's making sickness, they weren't sure if it was hot air, or why they got close to the shore, more of their sailors would die in a couple days, and they figured out pretty quick it was mosquitos.
[00:16:44.975 --> 00:16:47.457]  But the British classified that 400 years ago.
[00:16:47.517 --> 00:16:52.180]  So the British would always lay off the coast, and foreigners would ask, why did the Brits lay off the coast?
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.681]  They don't want mosquitos, and they get all the
[00:16:54.321 --> 00:16:56.602]  The fevers, the malaria that came with mosquitoes.
[00:16:56.862 --> 00:16:59.402]  The Brits also figured out with their scientists, limes.
[00:16:59.603 --> 00:17:01.243]  But the Brits were suspicious.
[00:17:01.283 --> 00:17:03.144]  The average sailor thought if you swim, you get sick.
[00:17:03.184 --> 00:17:05.684]  And they thought, you know, you don't want to eat vegetables, they make you sick.
[00:17:05.704 --> 00:17:07.485]  This is what people actually thought back then.
[00:17:08.305 --> 00:17:11.426]  So they would put the limes in the grog.
[00:17:11.986 --> 00:17:12.727]  Which is, what's grog?
[00:17:12.867 --> 00:17:14.208]  One-third rum, two-thirds water.
[00:17:14.448 --> 00:17:15.809]  To make sure they would at least drink their water.
[00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:19.171]  Part of their pay, their daily ration for good behavior, was grog.
[00:17:19.391 --> 00:17:24.395]  So on the job, all sailors, Spanish, Russian, didn't matter, they were paid in alcohol.
[00:17:24.535 --> 00:17:26.176]  And part of their daily food was alcohol.
[00:17:26.216 --> 00:17:31.360]  So the British would start putting, 400 years ago, limes in the alcohol, the grog.
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:37.304]  And so, what would happen when they were a thousand miles from home and ran up against a Spanish frigate twice their size?
[00:17:37.464 --> 00:17:39.506]  Well, the Spanish, all their teeth had fallen out.
[00:17:39.626 --> 00:17:40.867]  They had cuts all over them.
[00:17:41.047 --> 00:17:41.848]  Open wounds.
[00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:44.089]  No fresh vegetables.
[00:17:44.109 --> 00:17:57.819]  No vitamin C. Well, notice the British for 200 years could keep it secret that limes were... And so it was a joke to all the other armies that there were bags of limes and obsessions with limes and powdered lime powder to put in.
[00:17:58.099 --> 00:18:04.144]  And they would put it in the grog to make them drink it because they knew our troops are ready to fight.
[00:18:04.764 --> 00:18:07.925]  Because they've got vitamin C. So I'm going into a plug here, but here's the deal.
[00:18:08.105 --> 00:18:15.407]  Every study, Linus Pauling won two Nobel Prizes for vitamin C. And now if you have mega dosages of it, you basically never get cancer.
[00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:16.887]  So these are the things that are known.
[00:18:17.007 --> 00:18:20.689]  If you think vitamin C is powerful, the stuff at DNA Force is even beyond that.
[00:18:21.129 --> 00:18:22.169]  It's the next level of that.
[00:18:22.389 --> 00:18:23.150]  That's what we know.
[00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.934]  And when your body doesn't have the good halogen of iodine, it uses the bad halogen.
[00:18:28.054 --> 00:18:31.357]  And at a certain point, the cells are using toxic chemicals to survive.
[00:18:31.597 --> 00:18:37.703]  They start mutating so they can use that and not die, but then they take over your body and you die from cancer.
[00:18:37.843 --> 00:18:45.210]  And so, so much of the deformity and the mental illness and the low IQs and everything is that people have vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
[00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.592]  And they work around the clock with all these fake reports.
[00:18:47.652 --> 00:18:51.716]  Oh, you don't need vitamins, you don't need minerals, you don't need... And they lower the amount you're supposed to take.
[00:18:51.776 --> 00:18:54.759]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:19:03.107 --> 00:19:04.569]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[00:19:04.809 --> 00:19:06.591]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[00:19:06.951 --> 00:19:08.312]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[00:19:08.713 --> 00:19:09.594]  But I'll be honest with you.
[00:19:10.413 --> 00:19:14.864]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[00:19:15.766 --> 00:19:17.450]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:18.251]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[00:19:18.953 --> 00:19:19.695]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:19:20.703 --> 00:19:21.943]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[00:19:22.163 --> 00:19:24.584]  And I want to expand to the face of the globalists, not contract.
[00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:25.644]  I don't want them to win.
[00:19:26.024 --> 00:19:28.045]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:31.705]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[00:19:32.065 --> 00:19:34.826]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[00:19:35.226 --> 00:19:38.967]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[00:19:39.007 --> 00:19:40.247]  These will change your life.
[00:19:40.587 --> 00:19:41.967]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[00:19:41.987 --> 00:19:43.688]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[00:19:43.988 --> 00:19:44.648]  Check it all out.
[00:19:44.668 --> 00:19:48.229]  Whatever you do, take action and know, be part of the second American revolution.
[00:19:48.429 --> 00:19:49.609]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[00:19:50.009 --> 00:19:51.650]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:34.588 --> 00:20:35.508]  All right, welcome back.
[00:20:35.528 --> 00:20:38.250]  SimpleWars.com.
[00:20:41.191 --> 00:20:45.293]  Will Johnson, UnitedAmericaFirst.com, guest host sitting in for Alex.
[00:20:46.173 --> 00:20:51.215]  He is on vacation, but like I said earlier, he is never on vacation.
[00:20:51.275 --> 00:20:53.016]  He's always working hard.
[00:20:54.205 --> 00:20:57.787]  He's never, he's never stopped fighting against this tyranny.
[00:20:58.047 --> 00:21:12.976]  Okay, so what I was talking about before we went to the break, I was talking about Bernie Sanders and the white supremacists and how they're targeting President Trump and the main reason why they're doing this is to get black people, people of color, to not vote for President Trump.
[00:21:13.416 --> 00:21:18.179]  There was an article that came out, I guess it was maybe two weeks ago,
[00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:24.242]  Where they said it was 36% of the black community now supports President Trump.
[00:21:24.442 --> 00:21:27.224]  Can you imagine that?
[00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:27.224]  36%!
[00:21:27.304 --> 00:21:31.067]  So, all they're thinking is, okay, we have to change this number.
[00:21:31.467 --> 00:21:35.569]  We can't have people believing that President Trump is for the American people.
[00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:44.015]  You know, one thing that I've noticed, and I've always noticed this from the past, that every time you have a white person
[00:21:45.148 --> 00:21:45.828]  Yes, there it is.
[00:21:46.168 --> 00:21:54.930]  Every time you have a white person that does something, and I'm using President Trump in this example, but it's happened in the past, in history.
[00:21:55.290 --> 00:22:01.351]  Every time you have a white person that does something and black people benefit, guess what they do?
[00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:05.672]  They say he's a white supremacist, or they say he's being racist.
[00:22:06.432 --> 00:22:07.993]  It happens every single time.
[00:22:10.775 --> 00:22:14.397]  Or, if they don't call you white supremacist and they take you out, look at what they did to Abe Lincoln.
[00:22:14.717 --> 00:22:16.779]  You know, he freed the slaves.
[00:22:17.099 --> 00:22:17.779]  They took him out.
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.521]  They can't have those type of scenarios.
[00:22:21.541 --> 00:22:25.444]  They can't have people like President Trump helping black people and going around.
[00:22:25.784 --> 00:22:27.405]  What has President Trump done?
[00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:35.316]  Name one thing that he has done that would validate saying that he is a white supremacist.
[00:22:35.676 --> 00:22:36.617]  Because, oh, wait a minute.
[00:22:36.777 --> 00:22:37.938]  Charlottesville, right?
[00:22:38.058 --> 00:22:38.638]  Charlottesville.
[00:22:38.698 --> 00:22:41.260]  He said there were good people on both sides.
[00:22:42.021 --> 00:22:46.505]  I wish they would stop saying that there's no Democrats that are good on both sides.
[00:22:46.845 --> 00:22:50.648]  I mean, I wish they would say that because there has to be at least one Democrat that's good on that side.
[00:22:50.888 --> 00:22:51.629]  You get my point.
[00:22:53.134 --> 00:22:56.921]  But they keep saying that he's talking about all the white supremacists, good people on both sides.
[00:22:57.502 --> 00:23:00.086]  As if white people on the right are not good.
[00:23:01.729 --> 00:23:04.434]  You have to pay attention to exactly how they're doing this.
[00:23:04.775 --> 00:23:05.957]  And you know what, for the most part,
[00:23:06.764 --> 00:23:24.655]  Majority of the American people, they're either not even paying attention to this craziness, or if they are, the people that have brain cells left, they're not even saying, you know what, they're acknowledging that what the left is doing is completely crazy, and it does not go along with rational thinking.
[00:23:25.336 --> 00:23:26.997]  The American people are not dumb!
[00:23:28.066 --> 00:23:31.129]  The American people are not stupid, but for some reason you have the left.
[00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:36.715]  They believe that the American people don't understand what they're doing.
[00:23:36.735 --> 00:23:44.183]  For another example, and I'm not going to go into great detail on it, but Epstein, they believe that the American people
[00:23:45.369 --> 00:23:48.571]  Won't even question, how did Epstein die?
[00:23:49.411 --> 00:23:52.013]  Or all of these different things that took place during that.
[00:23:52.373 --> 00:23:58.717]  They expect, my point in that, is that they expect the American people to just go along with it and not even question it.
[00:23:59.517 --> 00:24:00.317]  This is what happened.
[00:24:00.337 --> 00:24:01.038]  This is what took place.
[00:24:01.738 --> 00:24:03.759]  Okay, so I have another video I want to play.
[00:24:03.799 --> 00:24:05.100]  This is of Cory Booker.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:05.840]  Okay?
[00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:08.082]  Or, I like to say Cory Booger.
[00:24:09.002 --> 00:24:09.763]  This is going to be number 10.
[00:24:11.007 --> 00:24:19.168]  I want to play this clip of Corey where he's trying to act like he's not, like he's not the racist or he's not sponsoring it.
[00:24:19.328 --> 00:24:20.569]  But that's exactly what they do.
[00:24:20.609 --> 00:24:26.310]  The Democrats sponsor, they advocate for it, they push for it, they want the division.
[00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.690]  Without it, they have nothing.
[00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:29.930]  Okay, so let's go to this clip, number 10.
[00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:40.032]  We can't let these conversations devolve into the impotent simplicity of who is or isn't a racist.
[00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:56.176]  Because if the answer to the question, do racism and white supremacy exist, is yes, then the real question isn't who is or isn't a racist, but who is and isn't doing something about it.
[00:25:04.957 --> 00:25:08.078]  This is a question that has a deep moral resonance.
[00:25:09.241 --> 00:25:13.703]  It's not enough to say I'm not a racist, we must be anti-racism.
[00:25:14.764 --> 00:25:17.225]  Because there's no neutrality in this fight.
[00:25:17.965 --> 00:25:22.667]  You are either an agent of justice or you are contributing to the problem.
[00:25:22.747 --> 00:25:23.648]  Okay, pause it right there.
[00:25:25.209 --> 00:25:28.130]  So you're either an agent or you're contributing to the problem.
[00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:37.975]  I would have to say that every single one of these politicians up on the hill that are Democrats leftists, and there's some rhinos in there, because they don't say anything.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.582]  They're contributing to all of this.
[00:25:40.862 --> 00:25:42.183]  They're the ones that's creating this.
[00:25:42.344 --> 00:25:44.786]  AOC, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar.
[00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:49.331]  They're like the four... And I can't even recall what the other lady's name is.
[00:25:51.513 --> 00:25:52.074]  Uh... Presley.
[00:25:52.864 --> 00:25:58.606]  They're all, and Mark Dice, he coined the term, the fascists four.
[00:25:59.226 --> 00:26:00.327]  The fascists four.
[00:26:00.667 --> 00:26:01.087]  I love it.
[00:26:01.847 --> 00:26:04.968]  But they are like the four horsewomen of the apocalypse.
[00:26:05.028 --> 00:26:12.751]  When it comes to the chaos and to the destruction of America, they are the ones that's leading the charge.
[00:26:13.151 --> 00:26:18.193]  And you have the rest of these people, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker,
[00:26:19.298 --> 00:26:26.965]  And Elizabeth Warren and the rest of them saying, oh yeah, we need to talk crazy like the four horsewomen of the apocalypse.
[00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:28.747]  Because they're getting attention.
[00:26:29.808 --> 00:26:31.069]  They're getting all the attention.
[00:26:31.109 --> 00:26:36.614]  So they're coming out, they're speaking just as crazy as the rest of them because they want the attention as well.
[00:26:37.235 --> 00:26:43.181]  My thing is that what we really need to pay attention to is the state of the world that we're in right now.
[00:26:44.534 --> 00:26:54.342]  The state of the world that we're in right now is that people are believing these crazy things that they're saying and they're taking it as if it's factual information.
[00:26:55.183 --> 00:26:57.064]  That's the part that people don't realize.
[00:26:57.104 --> 00:27:00.647]  They're taking it and believing it as if it's true!
[00:27:01.755 --> 00:27:03.997]  I mean, you can even talk about the whole climate deal.
[00:27:04.797 --> 00:27:05.438]  The climate deal.
[00:27:05.458 --> 00:27:07.819]  You pay money and the climate problems will go away.
[00:27:08.119 --> 00:27:11.061]  We're supposed to believe the nonsense that they're putting out.
[00:27:11.662 --> 00:27:20.128]  There's another thing I'm going to get to maybe in the third hour about how Elizabeth Warren is fighting for trans to have health care.
[00:27:20.748 --> 00:27:23.430]  Why not just... How come people just can't have health care?
[00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:27.272]  How come you just can't say, hey, I'm so-and-so and I need health care?
[00:27:27.953 --> 00:27:30.655]  And if you go to the doctor, how are they going to diagnose you?
[00:27:31.437 --> 00:27:33.238]  How did they know how to treat you?
[00:27:34.238 --> 00:27:36.099]  What if you have a groin problem?
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.140]  You know?
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.041]  Seriously, how did they do it?
[00:27:39.621 --> 00:27:40.782]  But anyways, I digress.
[00:27:41.902 --> 00:27:48.606]  The Democrats, the liberal media, the socialist internet media,
[00:27:49.668 --> 00:28:02.673]  Social media, I like to say socialist media, they are all colluding with one another to take out the President of the United States, and on top of that, to undermine the United States President.
[00:28:04.153 --> 00:28:04.933]  That's where we are.
[00:28:04.953 --> 00:28:14.517]  And if you don't recognize it, and you don't pay attention to what's going on, in this war that we're in right now, America is in the Second World War.
[00:28:15.595 --> 00:28:16.296]  Second World War.
[00:28:16.736 --> 00:28:17.657]  Second Civil War.
[00:28:18.217 --> 00:28:19.158]  We're in it right now.
[00:28:19.999 --> 00:28:21.780]  We're in the Second Civil War right now.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.064]  And if you don't recognize, you don't pay attention, you're just going to be a casualty of this war.
[00:28:27.985 --> 00:28:30.207]  So after the break, we're going to come back.
[00:28:30.367 --> 00:28:31.688]  Alex is going to be with us.
[00:28:31.708 --> 00:28:41.736]  We're going to talk more about, he's going to talk about the Veritas and the video that just came out where Google is getting caught red-handed doing it again.
[00:28:43.098 --> 00:28:43.738]  Red-handed.
[00:28:43.858 --> 00:28:46.400]  They got caught with their hand in the cookie jar.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.061]  You're gonna see that and much more from Alex after the break.
[00:28:50.101 --> 00:28:54.203]  My name is Will Johnson and this is Infowars.com.
[00:28:54.323 --> 00:29:09.510]  We'll be back after this.
[00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:10.271]  As usual,
[00:29:11.491 --> 00:29:16.174]  It seems like people are finally catching up to what InfoWars was breaking first.
[00:29:16.975 --> 00:29:18.176]  We know what's happening.
[00:29:18.216 --> 00:29:18.836]  We've seen it.
[00:29:18.856 --> 00:29:19.877]  We've seen it happen to you guys.
[00:29:20.457 --> 00:29:24.260]  I was just worried that people weren't really aware of how bad it is and what's really going on.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.402]  InfoWars has been on the front front of that fight.
[00:29:26.742 --> 00:29:28.083]  I've been on the front front of that fight.
[00:29:28.563 --> 00:29:29.504]  And we got to see more.
[00:29:29.684 --> 00:29:30.384]  You know, I say this.
[00:29:30.404 --> 00:29:31.525]  I'm going to say this about InfoWars.
[00:29:32.066 --> 00:29:33.807]  Everybody can say whatever they want.
[00:29:34.267 --> 00:29:36.149]  Alex Jones is the man, in my opinion.
[00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:37.610]  I mean, whatever people want to say.
[00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:38.951]  I've been a fan of InfoWars.
[00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:39.571]  Hey, Alex.
[00:29:39.831 --> 00:29:40.712]  Free Alex Jones.
[00:29:41.172 --> 00:29:44.075]  Alex Jones needs to be back on social media where he belongs.
[00:29:44.235 --> 00:29:50.681]  What happened to Alex is horrific, you know, and I think that he was just sort of the litmus test for a lot of these tech companies.
[00:29:50.721 --> 00:29:54.305]  You know, I can't say I agree with every single thing that Alex has said, but that's not the point.
[00:29:54.405 --> 00:29:56.527]  That he should have his freedom of speech and he should be able to have
[00:29:56.687 --> 00:30:01.650]  And I really hope that in the future we can get him and all of the other people that have been treated so terribly by big tech
[00:30:26.605 --> 00:30:32.109]  Oh, we can take him out because he's sort of the symbol of, you know, the most extreme voice out there, you know.
[00:30:32.129 --> 00:30:36.632]  And so I think to him, they targeted him and used him as an example.
[00:30:36.652 --> 00:30:38.473]  A modern-day deep person, basically.
[00:30:38.493 --> 00:30:39.554]  It's almost like a death sentence.
[00:30:39.574 --> 00:30:40.695]  You can't get your voice out there.
[00:30:41.075 --> 00:30:43.957]  But if they come after him, they can come after anyone.
[00:30:43.977 --> 00:30:46.279]  So he should have his platform just like anybody else does.
[00:30:46.679 --> 00:30:52.283]  InfoWars has given so many young people a platform in the beginning to get their voice out there.
[00:30:52.623 --> 00:30:59.991]  Luckily, Alex's and your guys' audience is so big and so loyal that they're able to follow him to, you know, his personal website or the show's website.
[00:31:00.351 --> 00:31:02.033]  But other people don't have that luxury, you know?
[00:31:02.073 --> 00:31:05.877]  If you're a smaller creator and you get de-platformed early on, no one will even know you exist.
[00:31:06.177 --> 00:31:07.919]  So, I gotta give a shout-out to InfoWars.
[00:31:07.939 --> 00:31:09.140]  I don't care what nobody will say.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.521]  I met Alex Jones personally.
[00:31:10.842 --> 00:31:14.806]  I buy the supplements and everything, so... I just wanna give a shout-out to y'all, man.
[00:31:14.846 --> 00:31:15.687]  You don't get enough credit.
[00:31:16.227 --> 00:31:17.169]  He's a freedom fighter.
[00:31:17.229 --> 00:31:19.193]  He should be here today at the White House.
[00:31:19.293 --> 00:31:19.994]  I love you, Alex.
[00:31:20.435 --> 00:31:25.284]  Everybody knows ground zero, patient zero is InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:26.026]  Everybody knows that.
[00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:41.572]  With our classic InfoWars fan favorite formula, Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a must have for any info warrior serious about their oral health.
[00:31:41.672 --> 00:31:45.876]  Featuring natural oils and ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[00:31:46.036 --> 00:31:49.858]  Fueled by the good halogen iodine and high quality nano silver.
[00:31:50.079 --> 00:31:54.822]  We've taken the fluoride out and replaced it with powerful ingredients to help boost your smile.
[00:31:55.022 --> 00:31:57.044]  Don't miss out on one of our best products.
[00:31:57.204 --> 00:32:02.028]  Power up your morning routine with Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste at the InfoWars store.
[00:32:02.935 --> 00:32:15.858]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[00:32:16.098 --> 00:32:18.639]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[00:32:19.019 --> 00:32:20.139]  farming goods a week ago.
[00:32:20.779 --> 00:32:24.420]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:29.002]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[00:32:29.623 --> 00:32:30.203]  That's beautiful.
[00:32:30.663 --> 00:32:32.224]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[00:32:32.565 --> 00:32:33.585]  And we aren't going to back down.
[00:32:34.166 --> 00:32:41.530]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.731]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[00:32:44.092 --> 00:32:47.974]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:32:48.274 --> 00:32:49.195]  And I'm asking listeners,
[00:32:49.975 --> 00:32:53.799]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:54.960]  We are the resistance.
[00:32:55.201 --> 00:32:56.142]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:32:56.162 --> 00:33:06.052]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.222 --> 00:33:15.803]  We've got it.
[00:33:15.843 --> 00:33:22.291]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:33:22.371 --> 00:33:24.474]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:26.736 --> 00:33:28.178]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.739 --> 00:33:32.443]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:36.967 --> 00:33:39.628]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:39.688 --> 00:33:42.070]  I'm broadcasting from San Diego, California.
[00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:45.912]  Will Johnson is in the Austin Infowars News Center, the ATX.
[00:33:46.312 --> 00:33:53.695]  And James O'Keefe of VeritasFame is on the road, but he's calling in and they'll let me know the minute that we get him.
[00:33:54.436 --> 00:33:59.038]  There has been a new giant Google data dump by whistleblowers.
[00:33:59.959 --> 00:34:01.559]  Google Machine Learning.
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:02.920]  Fairness.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.561]  It's always Orwellian named.
[00:34:05.586 --> 00:34:09.428]  Whistleblower goes public, says burden lifted off my soul.
[00:34:10.789 --> 00:34:15.592]  And they have in there specifically that InfoWars is not good information.
[00:34:15.852 --> 00:34:24.517]  They've said, because I exposed everything, you know, years and decades before, like Trump would win and then Jeffrey Epstein was running a pedophile island.
[00:34:25.538 --> 00:34:28.239]  And so I've got to be stopped.
[00:34:28.839 --> 00:34:29.580]  But here's the big thing.
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.442]  They've been telling Congress that they don't censor any conservatives.
[00:34:33.462 --> 00:34:34.883]  They don't censor any libertarians.
[00:34:35.182 --> 00:34:37.222]  They don't censor any Trump supporters.
[00:34:37.783 --> 00:34:42.084]  They only censor fake news, which they can define as whatever they want.
[00:34:42.684 --> 00:34:49.846]  And then, of course, Mitch McConnell tried to put a link up to his house being basically assaulted.
[00:34:50.346 --> 00:34:51.306]  People say they want to kill him.
[00:34:52.386 --> 00:35:03.949]  They let the people keep their videos up on Twitter and Facebook that were pro-attack Mitch McConnell, leader of the Senate, but they would not allow the
[00:35:04.784 --> 00:35:05.624]  Response to it.
[00:35:05.664 --> 00:35:16.249]  And that's what this is about, is fixing the election as the last big piece or tranche of documents showed a month ago from James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[00:35:16.269 --> 00:35:17.030]  He joins us now.
[00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:20.771]  Please, in the one segment you have, you've got the floor, James O'Keefe.
[00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:27.154]  Tell us about the latest bombshell, right as Trump says he's drafting executive orders to take action.
[00:35:28.835 --> 00:35:29.815]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[00:35:30.996 --> 00:35:31.776]  Yes, sir, I can.
[00:35:32.076 --> 00:35:33.057]  Again, can you hear me, James?
[00:35:33.956 --> 00:35:37.897]  Yes, this is a story that was broke today.
[00:35:37.917 --> 00:35:47.399]  The insider who sent us the machine learning documents has gone public, and he says a burden has been lifted off of his soul.
[00:35:47.419 --> 00:35:50.060]  His name is Zachary Voorhees.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:57.122]  He's released thousands of documents from within Google, blacklists, human raiders.
[00:35:58.142 --> 00:36:02.263]  He's basically blowing the whistle and saying that this is his Google Snowden moment.
[00:36:02.992 --> 00:36:04.953]  And he's willing to go public.
[00:36:05.274 --> 00:36:08.636]  He was making $260,000 working for Google a year.
[00:36:08.656 --> 00:36:13.560]  He says the police have been called on him from Google.
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.922]  There's video of him, police confronting him outside his home.
[00:36:17.462 --> 00:36:18.783]  So this man has gone public.
[00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:22.266]  He sat down and talked to me, and the video is up online, Alex, now.
[00:36:24.423 --> 00:36:25.003]  That's amazing.
[00:36:25.023 --> 00:36:29.584]  And after you leave us, we're grabbing that video right now from Project Veritas website.
[00:36:29.804 --> 00:36:33.405]  Tell people the headline on that video so they can find it and share it easier.
[00:36:34.646 --> 00:36:40.747]  The headline, Alex, is Google whistleblower goes public, says, quote, burden lifted off of my soul.
[00:36:41.308 --> 00:36:42.508]  That's the headline of the video.
[00:36:42.528 --> 00:36:43.268]  And it's on Twitter.
[00:36:43.308 --> 00:36:44.128]  It's on YouTube.
[00:36:44.528 --> 00:36:47.009]  It's the highest performing YouTube video we've ever done.
[00:36:47.209 --> 00:36:48.870]  Today, it's blowing up YouTube.
[00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:50.430]  We hope they don't take it down.
[00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.711]  If they don't take it down, it'll get well over a million views.
[00:36:55.345 --> 00:36:57.726]  Well, this should get 500 million views.
[00:36:57.846 --> 00:37:02.849]  I mean, Google's testified, I was there when it happened, that they don't control any searches of any type.
[00:37:03.009 --> 00:37:04.910]  Well, their whole system is about controlling searches.
[00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:06.891]  That they've never censored anybody.
[00:37:06.971 --> 00:37:09.812]  I mean, they have really perjured themselves to Congress.
[00:37:09.832 --> 00:37:13.214]  Can you elaborate on just how wild these documents are?
[00:37:13.234 --> 00:37:14.934]  This is beyond smoking gun.
[00:37:16.015 --> 00:37:22.078]  Well, I think, in the video, he goes into the blacklists that exist at Google.
[00:37:23.541 --> 00:37:29.362]  These are documents that prove, maybe, that they've perjured themselves under oath.
[00:37:30.522 --> 00:37:35.103]  He talks about this algorithmic fairness document that was leaked.
[00:37:35.123 --> 00:37:37.344]  This is the one that was cited in congressional hearings.
[00:37:38.064 --> 00:37:47.905]  Algorithmic fairness sounds like Orwellian fiction, but it's an actual document within Google talking about machine learning fairness.
[00:37:47.945 --> 00:37:51.506]  They need to use product intervention to make the world more fair.
[00:37:52.552 --> 00:38:01.736]  And it's pretty extraordinary, perhaps the most extraordinary thing is that he has a thousand of these documents, and we've published them on our website.
[00:38:02.836 --> 00:38:10.940]  A fringe-ranking classifier score that lists various news sites, including CNN, and gives them ratings.
[00:38:12.336 --> 00:38:22.180]  Internal Threat of Communication shows an apparent discussion about a coffee beans document where one Google employee expresses concern about hiring.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.641]  So it's all there.
[00:38:23.661 --> 00:38:39.467]  It's a WikiLeaks-style dump on our website, projectveritas.com, and Zach has courageously been willing to put himself on the line for the country with the hope that others follow in his footsteps, Alex.
[00:38:41.073 --> 00:38:41.534]  Incredible.
[00:38:41.574 --> 00:38:51.629]  Let's remember Google has decided, along with other tech giants, to move to China to help suppress their population, to help build censorship search engines like Dragonfly.
[00:38:51.969 --> 00:38:53.051]  They're already implementing
[00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:58.962]  That here, Bing is somewhat censored, but nothing compared to Google.
[00:38:59.422 --> 00:39:08.067]  We put in exact Breitbart headlines, exact InfoWars headlines, exact Project Veritas headlines, and they won't even come up on Google.
[00:39:08.147 --> 00:39:12.330]  You go to Bing, they're at the very, very top, and that's owned by Microsoft.
[00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:16.212]  Google has done what no one except the Chi-Coms have done before.
[00:39:16.772 --> 00:39:20.573]  Build a search engine where they just put what they want on the top.
[00:39:21.113 --> 00:39:29.094]  And the even bigger scandal is, it's coming out that people are paying, not just for the top-ranking as an ad, but that the other stuff is being paid to put up there.
[00:39:29.114 --> 00:39:32.935]  And obviously, it's going to take time to go through all these documents, but bombshell after bombshell.
[00:39:33.255 --> 00:39:36.256]  But look at the intimidation factor of them sending the police after him.
[00:39:37.696 --> 00:39:42.217]  Yeah, they did what we've learned to be a wellness check.
[00:39:45.019 --> 00:39:47.841]  Zach believes that Google called the police on him.
[00:39:47.901 --> 00:39:50.603]  Google confirmed that they received a call.
[00:39:50.783 --> 00:39:52.844]  Sorry, the police confirmed they received a call.
[00:39:53.785 --> 00:40:04.011]  And there's videotape of Zach in San Francisco on the street outside of his apartment, putting his hands up and, I guess, submitting to the police.
[00:40:04.771 --> 00:40:07.593]  Again, Google has sent Zach a legal letter.
[00:40:08.454 --> 00:40:11.295]  They are threatening him to cooperate.
[00:40:12.892 --> 00:40:19.337]  Alex did, in fact, cooperate with the authorities, but sent the documents to the Department of Justice under William Barr.
[00:40:19.857 --> 00:40:21.078]  So this is all happening.
[00:40:21.338 --> 00:40:24.600]  It's all part of this watershed moment, this series of events.
[00:40:25.181 --> 00:40:27.443]  These whistleblowers, these brave insiders.
[00:40:27.583 --> 00:40:30.485]  Alex, we know there's many more people on the inside.
[00:40:30.545 --> 00:40:32.046]  We've asked them to come forward.
[00:40:32.466 --> 00:40:33.927]  We know that they will come forward.
[00:40:34.528 --> 00:40:40.012]  Our email address that they're coming to is VeritasTipsAtProtonMail.com.
[00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:45.831]  That's Veritas, V-E-R-I-T-A-S, tips at protonmail.com.
[00:40:46.591 --> 00:40:54.774]  And we believe that there are people listening to this interview right now who work for Google, who are on the fence about coming public.
[00:40:54.794 --> 00:40:55.434]  They're afraid.
[00:40:55.854 --> 00:40:56.755]  Don't be afraid.
[00:40:57.055 --> 00:41:05.638]  They're actually more afraid of us than we are afraid of them, because you can't stop morally courageous people who keep on coming out.
[00:41:07.178 --> 00:41:07.879]  Well, that's right.
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.501]  Look at how InfoWars is listed in there.
[00:41:11.521 --> 00:41:13.762]  I mean, they sit up there and say, we're not censoring anybody.
[00:41:13.782 --> 00:41:14.943]  They're censoring everybody.
[00:41:14.963 --> 00:41:17.044]  And notice InfoWars is in there.
[00:41:19.105 --> 00:41:20.245]  InfoWars is in there.
[00:41:20.325 --> 00:41:23.847]  They have a lot of conservative websites in there.
[00:41:24.427 --> 00:41:26.808]  Again, people say, what's the solution?
[00:41:26.848 --> 00:41:27.609]  What's the solution?
[00:41:27.649 --> 00:41:28.829]  We don't want government involvement.
[00:41:28.909 --> 00:41:30.530]  I'm not suggesting government involvement.
[00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:34.812]  I'm suggesting these companies be honest about what it is that they're doing.
[00:41:35.012 --> 00:41:36.893]  At the very least, let's begin with that.
[00:41:37.406 --> 00:41:42.652]  And the only way to make them honest is to hold their feet to the fire, and let some might be the best disinfectant.
[00:41:42.993 --> 00:41:44.975]  You can't perjure yourself in Congress.
[00:41:45.015 --> 00:41:48.079]  You can't lie to the government, at the very least.
[00:41:48.559 --> 00:41:57.690]  So we want them to be honest, and we think that a continued crusade of people like Jack, but if you watch this video, again, the title of the video is
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.843]  Google Whistleblower goes public and says, quote, burden lifted off my soul.
[00:42:02.364 --> 00:42:04.526]  What strikes you is the passion of Zach.
[00:42:04.566 --> 00:42:07.429]  He's an extremely passionate, committed man.
[00:42:07.449 --> 00:42:09.931]  He's given up his salary, his ability to get a job.
[00:42:15.316 --> 00:42:18.037]  None of that matters to him.
[00:42:18.137 --> 00:42:20.477]  By Silicon Valley standards, this man's a hero.
[00:42:20.757 --> 00:42:36.200]  And talking about next shoe to drop, what would you call this time we're in historically where there's a quickening with Epstein and the Chinese government and the economic war and all the Clinton corruption and the foundation and the FBI corruption, Justice Department and the Russiagate.
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.001]  I mean, the wheels are coming off everything.
[00:42:39.341 --> 00:42:43.702]  And I think the hubris of the Democrats and the hubris of big tech at some point has got to break.
[00:42:45.894 --> 00:42:47.736]  I think it is a watershed moment, Alex.
[00:42:47.836 --> 00:42:51.819]  I think the people on the inside of these organizations are heroes.
[00:42:52.479 --> 00:42:53.921]  Our heroes tend to be anonymous.
[00:42:54.501 --> 00:42:57.884]  They're not the celebrity, flashy people we see in corporate media.
[00:42:58.264 --> 00:43:02.167]  They're not the deep state individuals or the government individuals.
[00:43:02.187 --> 00:43:02.948]  Amazing job!
[00:43:07.054 --> 00:43:08.355]  Let's go with Aaron in Alabama.
[00:43:08.375 --> 00:43:09.175]  Thanks for calling, Aaron.
[00:43:09.195 --> 00:43:09.596]  You're on the air.
[00:43:09.756 --> 00:43:10.256]  Hey, Alex.
[00:43:10.376 --> 00:43:14.378]  I want to say I've been in broadcasting, or I was, for about 15 years as a programmer.
[00:43:14.499 --> 00:43:16.940]  And to be honest, I hadn't heard of you until about six months ago.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:18.681]  And I'm very thankful that I found you.
[00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:22.283]  You touch on a lot of stuff that I've felt in my heart and soul for my whole life.
[00:43:22.323 --> 00:43:23.644]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[00:43:23.684 --> 00:43:24.084]  Exactly.
[00:43:24.104 --> 00:43:25.085]  We're all kindred spirits.
[00:43:25.265 --> 00:43:25.785]  We really are.
[00:43:25.805 --> 00:43:26.246]  We really are.
[00:43:26.266 --> 00:43:27.947]  And listen, I've got a couple of points to make.
[00:43:27.967 --> 00:43:30.630]  But first, I've had body pain all over my entire life.
[00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:33.072]  And you know the product better than anybody there, I think.
[00:43:33.292 --> 00:43:34.173]  What would you recommend?
[00:43:34.353 --> 00:43:36.996]  I mean, literally, it's joints, it's muscle, it's everything.
[00:43:37.056 --> 00:43:38.857]  What would you recommend to me to purchase?
[00:43:38.877 --> 00:43:42.340]  You know, I think X2 or X3 because that's a building block to everything.
[00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:44.122]  If you don't have that, the bad halogens take over.
[00:43:44.142 --> 00:43:46.344]  And I would think Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:43:46.424 --> 00:43:47.685]  Turmeric is amazing.
[00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:49.227]  This is a very strong extract.
[00:43:49.247 --> 00:43:50.368]  One of the strongest out there.
[00:43:50.388 --> 00:43:51.749]  Probably the strongest, but there may be one stronger.
[00:43:53.933 --> 00:43:56.335]  I would think Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:43:56.495 --> 00:44:00.477]  They've all bombarded us with synthetic hormones that mess up our body.
[00:44:00.557 --> 00:44:13.386]  But then, if you get Preglanone, in my experience, I'm no doctor, I just talk to the scientists, with these other herbs like Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus, I think you should go through the products, every body is different, and test stuff out for yourself, and then just see what works best for you.
[00:44:13.426 --> 00:44:21.451]  But they're all super game-changing, the best we can get, the best labs, the cleanest, just like whatever is the most proven, the best, I go produce it.
[00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:22.112]  That's it.
[00:44:22.332 --> 00:44:23.593]  Because I would, I'm gonna say this again,
[00:44:24.053 --> 00:44:25.375]  I'm a very superstitious person.
[00:44:26.136 --> 00:44:27.137]  And by that, I'm God-fearing.
[00:44:27.757 --> 00:44:29.079]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:30.180]  You've got my total commitment.
[00:44:30.421 --> 00:44:37.429]  Anything I do, information, any of it, products, like they went out and tested, third parties did, Alexa Pure and Pro Pure.
[00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:38.910]  Some are better at this, some are better at that.
[00:44:38.931 --> 00:44:43.135]  People are like, wow, we tested 30 gravity-fed filters and you have like the two best.
[00:44:43.436 --> 00:44:44.417]  Why'd I do that?
[00:44:44.557 --> 00:44:46.079]  What the hell do you think I'm doing?
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:57.137]  I go out and find out what is the best price for the best quality, because there's always like some space-age $5,000 thing that's better, but I look at a line of like, what is the lowest price for the best benefit, and that's what I promote.
[00:44:57.257 --> 00:44:59.020]  So, so, that's my advice on that.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:44:59.641]  Go ahead, sorry.
[00:45:00.021 --> 00:45:06.348]  Well, and I appreciate that, and I can tell just from the way you talk about the product, I feel like I can trust you that you kind of do things the way I do.
[00:45:06.388 --> 00:45:08.310]  You either do it right the first time, or just don't do it.
[00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:09.871]  And I feel like I can trust you on your product.
[00:45:09.911 --> 00:45:17.099]  Well then listen, don't trust me, because here's the deal, is you need to talk to a physician, you need to research, because the iodine conspiracy is everything.
[00:45:17.319 --> 00:45:18.861]  Most people have almost none of it.
[00:45:18.881 --> 00:45:21.925]  But if you've had none of it for 20 years, you take a bunch, you can have some issues.
[00:45:22.085 --> 00:45:23.226]  Detoxing, you name it.
[00:45:23.286 --> 00:45:25.950]  I mean, this is it, man.
[00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:27.491]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[00:45:27.632 --> 00:45:28.292]  It's dangerous.
[00:45:28.493 --> 00:45:31.176]  Because it's an element you've got to have, they've taken away from you.
[00:45:31.256 --> 00:45:33.098]  Well, what happens when you finally get it?
[00:45:33.178 --> 00:45:33.799]  You've got to be careful.
[00:45:33.919 --> 00:45:37.700]  Because if you've not had this, your body will take in bromine, chloride, fluoride.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.321]  There's a whole bunch of bad halogens.
[00:45:40.521 --> 00:45:42.041]  Your organs, everything operates.
[00:45:42.242 --> 00:45:44.402]  Your hormones are produced with halogen.
[00:45:44.502 --> 00:45:48.103]  And so the globalists have been targeting that with bad halogens that block it.
[00:45:48.163 --> 00:45:49.124]  So this is the good thing.
[00:45:49.164 --> 00:45:52.125]  But like anybody knows, it's like being punched in the head by a mule.
[00:45:52.145 --> 00:45:53.405]  It's like, oh, that's the real thing.
[00:45:53.465 --> 00:45:54.305]  Yeah, that's the mule.
[00:45:54.445 --> 00:45:56.366]  So I'm just telling people, this X2 isn't a joke.
[00:45:56.466 --> 00:45:58.146]  We just research what the globalists are doing.
[00:45:58.286 --> 00:45:59.067]  We do the opposite.
[00:45:59.107 --> 00:46:00.247]  But yes, everyone
[00:46:00.407 --> 00:46:04.769]  With X2, X3, you need to consult a physician, because you're like, oh, that's just Mother Nature.
[00:46:04.789 --> 00:46:05.849]  Yeah, Mother Nature.
[00:46:05.969 --> 00:46:09.831]  The drug companies and all the stuff they do is a counterfeit of what God's already given us, okay?
[00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:10.811]  So I'm gonna explain it again.
[00:46:10.891 --> 00:46:13.052]  Without iodine, you die.
[00:46:13.272 --> 00:46:14.533]  The fields are depleted.
[00:46:14.693 --> 00:46:15.473]  Everything's depleted.
[00:46:15.673 --> 00:46:21.155]  Most iodine is bound to iron, copper, or lead, or something else.
[00:46:21.215 --> 00:46:22.056]  You don't get it.
[00:46:22.156 --> 00:46:24.777]  Pure iodine is explosive.
[00:46:25.057 --> 00:46:26.057]  So yeah, be careful.
[00:46:26.217 --> 00:46:27.498]  Iodine, you have to have.
[00:46:28.238 --> 00:46:29.999]  It's just paramount.
[00:46:30.579 --> 00:46:32.440]  And so that's why we sell it.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.560]  That's why we've hyped it up.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.021]  Because it's what they don't want you to have.
[00:46:36.061 --> 00:46:40.923]  But yeah, if you've been off of it and not had iodine for your whole life, it's like you've never been in a boxing ring.
[00:46:41.143 --> 00:46:42.664]  And you get the ring with Mike Tyson.
[00:46:42.724 --> 00:46:45.325]  Your body's gonna be like, what the hell is that?
[00:46:45.585 --> 00:46:46.906]  Because you never had it.
[00:46:47.086 --> 00:46:47.966]  It's just iodine.
[00:46:48.046 --> 00:46:49.807]  It's the magic sauce, folks.
[00:46:50.047 --> 00:46:51.748]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:52.888 --> 00:46:55.209]  Thank you for shopping and getting great products.
[00:46:55.329 --> 00:46:57.290]  And it helps fund this operation a total 360.
[00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:59.453]  You win, and you know I love those.
[00:47:07.068 --> 00:47:09.653]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:27.153 --> 00:47:29.455]  Welcome back on this live Wednesday Global Edition.
[00:47:29.475 --> 00:47:31.056]  Will Johnson's riding shotgun with me.
[00:47:31.156 --> 00:47:32.537]  James O'Keefe can only do one segment.
[00:47:32.557 --> 00:47:35.120]  He's on the road going into another meeting.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:44.047]  And ladies and gentlemen, we got secret Google documents a year and a half ago from a source, I'll just leave it at that, inside Google.
[00:47:44.587 --> 00:47:56.137]  They were paying millions of dollars to have people organically go out and downvote me all over the web in ratings so that Google could delist me
[00:47:56.687 --> 00:47:59.749]  And then say he's rated as a non-credible source.
[00:48:00.429 --> 00:48:01.950]  They also did it to my credit rating.
[00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:03.271]  They did it to my banking rating.
[00:48:04.311 --> 00:48:06.673]  And yeah, we're getting the lawsuits ready.
[00:48:07.713 --> 00:48:10.855]  You saw that the Covington Kid lawsuit got thrown out.
[00:48:11.876 --> 00:48:13.457]  Robert Barnes predicted that here on air.
[00:48:13.477 --> 00:48:20.421]  It was basically from his research, what they call captured counsels, what it looked like.
[00:48:21.782 --> 00:48:23.202]  It got thrown out immediately.
[00:48:23.262 --> 00:48:24.323]  He's filed suits there.
[00:48:24.723 --> 00:48:25.904]  We are getting ready to file suits.
[00:48:27.336 --> 00:48:32.159]  The Epstein case to bring out even more documents and we're looking to file suits on some of these financial institutions.
[00:48:32.199 --> 00:48:34.741]  We have them dead to rights, it's just going to cost a lot of money.
[00:48:35.982 --> 00:48:38.984]  This war cost a lot of money.
[00:48:40.324 --> 00:48:47.229]  To stand up and fight these people cost a lot of money, but now the climate is here, the climate is right, and Trump is starting to take big action.
[00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:55.454]  These companies are spying on us, they're selling our data, they're working with foreign governments, they're working with authoritarians, they're acting in total bad faith.
[00:48:56.676 --> 00:48:57.756]  And they've lied to Congress.
[00:48:58.696 --> 00:49:03.277]  And they are stealing our futures and stealing our ability to see and hear what we want.
[00:49:03.777 --> 00:49:05.278]  This show is compelling.
[00:49:06.078 --> 00:49:06.958]  It's powerful.
[00:49:07.538 --> 00:49:08.518]  Because of our guests.
[00:49:08.938 --> 00:49:09.958]  Because of our research.
[00:49:10.238 --> 00:49:11.739]  And because of our dedication.
[00:49:13.479 --> 00:49:20.520]  There's a lot of things in the chemical kingdom where you'll have a drug that something is supposed to carry the drug across the blood-brain barrier.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.181]  Tobacco companies add chemicals to cigarettes
[00:49:25.808 --> 00:49:28.550]  To make it go across the blood-brain barrier even more.
[00:49:29.631 --> 00:49:31.292]  Well, that's an analogy of InfoWars.
[00:49:32.793 --> 00:49:33.514]  I can be brash.
[00:49:33.674 --> 00:49:34.435]  I can be aggressive.
[00:49:34.515 --> 00:49:35.195]  I can be angry.
[00:49:35.615 --> 00:49:38.498]  But I carry it across the blood-brain barrier.
[00:49:38.778 --> 00:49:39.618]  All the other guests.
[00:49:39.739 --> 00:49:40.519]  All the other info.
[00:49:40.579 --> 00:49:41.640]  I got people's attention.
[00:49:42.801 --> 00:49:44.682]  I love being made fun of in memes and things.
[00:49:45.843 --> 00:49:47.685]  The Globals figure that out and they try to stop it.
[00:49:48.005 --> 00:49:49.286]  Because I didn't care what happened to me.
[00:49:50.286 --> 00:49:52.048]  I cared about the truth getting across.
[00:49:52.348 --> 00:49:53.409]  So when it all came out,
[00:49:54.699 --> 00:49:55.880]  People know they were being lied to.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:59.643]  So on hundreds and hundreds of issues, we've been proven totally right.
[00:49:59.703 --> 00:50:00.744]  Our guests have been proven right.
[00:50:00.864 --> 00:50:02.865]  And you are the info war.
[00:50:02.925 --> 00:50:04.526]  I'm not just saying that as a pat on the head.
[00:50:05.327 --> 00:50:06.388]  You are the reason we're here.
[00:50:07.268 --> 00:50:10.931]  So please take advantage of the ultra-massive extended sale.
[00:50:10.951 --> 00:50:12.933]  We've had to take some of the things down because they're about to sell out.
[00:50:13.453 --> 00:50:19.357]  So it's a new sale, but it's still store-wide free shipping, double pay, three points, and massive specials up to 60% off.
[00:50:19.637 --> 00:50:20.578]  Swirlable food, still 50% off.
[00:50:20.598 --> 00:50:22.099]  They're telling me that has to end.
[00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:23.000]  A lot of the water
[00:50:25.572 --> 00:50:30.436]  Yes, Twitter might slap you on the wrist or Google might do something to you if you share this.
[00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:52.146]  But they're going to take everything you've got, these bullies, if you don't start standing up.
[00:50:52.686 --> 00:50:54.207]  So I know our audience gets that.
[00:50:54.547 --> 00:50:55.948]  It's time to bring more people in.
[00:50:56.408 --> 00:50:59.149]  And in closing, a lot of folks right now are blown away.
[00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:05.973]  A lot of people right now are apologizing to InfoWars, and we're seeing the most traffic we've ever received since the last election.
[00:51:06.953 --> 00:51:09.894]  People are really understanding that we're not playing games.
[00:51:10.295 --> 00:51:13.716]  And sure, this stuff sounds incredible and shocking, but it's true.
[00:51:14.096 --> 00:51:15.137]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:51:15.657 --> 00:51:17.118]  So think of what's coming next.
[00:51:17.802 --> 00:51:20.783]  Think of what's going to come out next on Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple.
[00:51:21.204 --> 00:51:24.725]  Think about what a huge time in history we're in and how amazing this all is.
[00:51:25.045 --> 00:51:34.109]  So here's the whistleblower that the police have now come to his house, hands up, as a Google intimidation in San Francisco, which they own, but he still is persevering.
[00:51:34.329 --> 00:51:36.670]  And I can't wait to try to get this whistleblower on the broadcast.
[00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:37.951]  Here it is with James O'Keefe.
[00:51:38.973 --> 00:51:46.055]  I've been living with this, like, burden for three years, since 2016, when they started changing everything.
[00:51:46.235 --> 00:52:01.799]  And, you know, and to have that burden lifted off of my soul is... I've never felt happier or, you know, more at peace with myself than I have, like, right now.
[00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:13.971]  The police didn't announce themselves.
[00:52:14.471 --> 00:52:16.552]  I decided that I'm just not going to talk to them.
[00:52:17.212 --> 00:52:21.974]  So, why are the police outside your home in San Francisco?
[00:52:21.994 --> 00:52:25.856]  And so, what I did is I put out a dead man's switch.
[00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:26.996]  People are like, well, you're brave.
[00:52:27.076 --> 00:52:32.559]  It's like, when I'm coming and explaining what Google was doing, this is an act of atonement.
[00:52:33.499 --> 00:52:33.779]  Okay?
[00:52:33.819 --> 00:52:35.180]  To make my conscience clear.
[00:52:36.698 --> 00:52:38.278]  They're not an objective piece.
[00:52:38.298 --> 00:52:40.719]  They're not an objective source of information.
[00:52:41.119 --> 00:52:48.842]  They are a highly biased political machine that is bent on never letting somebody like Donald Trump come to power again.
[00:52:49.282 --> 00:53:02.706]  The Google whistleblower has come out of the shadows, this time releasing a large cache of remarkable confidential Google documents that expose Google's political bias and a scary progressive social agenda.
[00:53:03.166 --> 00:53:07.987]  My name is Zach Voorhees, and I was an employee at Google for eight years.
[00:53:08.547 --> 00:53:14.929]  And the reason why I collected these documents was because I saw something dark and nefarious going on with the company.
[00:53:16.009 --> 00:53:25.251]  I felt that our entire election system was going to be compromised forever by this company that told the American public that it was
[00:53:25.971 --> 00:53:27.052]  Not gonna do any evil.
[00:53:27.573 --> 00:53:38.605]  And I saw that they were making really quick moves, not only in the documents, but also in the internal speeches that the executives were giving to the company, that they were intending to do that.
[00:53:38.645 --> 00:53:41.748]  They were intending to scope the information landscape.
[00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:47.413]  So that they could create their own version of what was objectively true.
[00:53:47.853 --> 00:53:49.214]  It was June 24th.
[00:53:49.554 --> 00:53:56.879]  Project Veritas released an investigation that included an interview in the shadows with Google insider Zach Voorhees.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:00.402]  Within days, it seems, Google was on to him.
[00:54:01.082 --> 00:54:03.004]  What happened since you and I last spoke?
[00:54:04.382 --> 00:54:08.765]  There's a lot of stuff that happened since you and I last spoke.
[00:54:08.785 --> 00:54:11.807]  I went back to San Francisco and I laid low.
[00:54:12.907 --> 00:54:21.252]  And then, out of the blue, I got a letter from Google indicating that they knew what I had done.
[00:54:22.973 --> 00:54:32.339]  And that letter contained several demands, six of them in fact, asking me whether I retained documents.
[00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:37.178]  Asking me to list the people that I give the documents to and, uh...
[00:54:40.993 --> 00:54:53.197]  Requesting access to all of the data, all of my personal data, my laptop, my backup hard drives, in order for them to come in and start scrubbing all of it.
[00:54:53.837 --> 00:54:57.178]  So we have the letter in front of us, and I have a copy of it here.
[00:54:57.518 --> 00:54:59.159]  This letter does make a few demands.
[00:54:59.199 --> 00:55:00.960]  It asks you to cease and desist.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:06.161]  It asks you to comply by a certain date, no later than Friday, July 26th.
[00:55:06.221 --> 00:55:06.541]  Did you?
[00:55:08.622 --> 00:55:08.942]  I did.
[00:55:08.962 --> 00:55:09.703]  I did comply.
[00:55:10.143 --> 00:55:11.223]  And I complied honestly.
[00:55:12.104 --> 00:55:12.604]  What did you do?
[00:55:13.324 --> 00:55:16.025]  What I told Google is that, yes, I had retained some of their files.
[00:55:17.006 --> 00:55:20.047]  And I told them that, yes, I had sent it out.
[00:55:20.587 --> 00:55:26.510]  And I told them truthfully that I had sent their files to law enforcement.
[00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:29.171]  What law enforcement agency did you send it to?
[00:55:29.751 --> 00:55:36.014]  The law enforcement agency that I sent it to was the Department of Justice Antitrust Division under Attorney General William Barr.
[00:55:36.474 --> 00:55:40.376]  But according to Zach, Google's attacks on him had only just begun.
[00:55:40.396 --> 00:55:49.841]  A Twitter troll outed him as the leaker, saying... By the way, Zach, shouldn't you remove well-employed tech geek from your bio, Mr. Leaker?
[00:55:51.122 --> 00:55:54.324]  So, who do you think One Snowflake is?
[00:55:55.168 --> 00:56:02.430]  Well, I had my suspicions that it might be an insider from Google, since that information that he posted wasn't public.
[00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:14.772]  After I realized that Google knew who I was, I started going to lawyers and attorneys and trying to figure out what Google's likely next step was going to be.
[00:56:15.652 --> 00:56:17.573]  And both attorneys that I talked to
[00:56:18.553 --> 00:56:21.755]  Both said, this is the first step in having your life ruined.
[00:56:22.236 --> 00:56:23.196]  They're going to come after you.
[00:56:23.697 --> 00:56:25.518]  And so I realized this is what was coming to me.
[00:56:25.638 --> 00:56:30.322]  So what I want to let them know is, you know, um, you know,
[00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:34.512]  Look, I've, yeah, I've got your data.
[00:56:34.852 --> 00:56:35.112]  Yeah.
[00:56:35.332 --> 00:56:51.605]  And so what I did is I put out a dead man switch so that in case they were going to either try to destroy my life through the legal system or that they were trying to just, you know, off me because, you know, I'm exposing their, a really big thing, how they are tampering with elections.
[00:56:52.366 --> 00:56:58.410]  Um, I wanted to let them know that, hey, look, if something were to happen with me, then these documents are going to be released immediately.
[00:56:58.431 --> 00:57:01.453]  And what is a dead man switch for those who aren't familiar with that?
[00:57:01.713 --> 00:57:12.378]  So a dead man switch is something that people that have information about a corporation or somebody else, and they're concerned about their personal safety and possibly their life.
[00:57:12.839 --> 00:57:22.824]  And what they do is that they let that entity know that in the case that they get offed, that the information will be released to the public.
[00:57:23.624 --> 00:57:29.488]  And so I set up a dead man switch to trigger in the case that I was killed or assassinated.
[00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:37.694]  And so I let them know that I was willing to do that and to protect myself.
[00:57:39.195 --> 00:57:47.981]  The next day, the police began looking for me in two different locations.
[00:57:48.061 --> 00:57:48.522]  So Google...
[00:57:55.484 --> 00:57:59.500]  When you finance what we're doing, you're not just funding the Second American Revolution.
[00:58:00.882 --> 00:58:02.463]  You're changing world destiny.
[00:58:02.783 --> 00:58:07.366]  And there's so much fake stuff out there in a million different voices, and I understand that.
[00:58:07.426 --> 00:58:12.570]  But we really are in the zeitgeist, and we try to make it easy to get good products at the same time.
[00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:19.014]  But I can just tell you point blank, you cannot invest in a place better than InfoWars for human liberty and a pro-human future.
[00:58:19.074 --> 00:58:24.798]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[00:58:24.838 --> 00:58:27.300]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.002]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[00:58:30.022 --> 00:58:32.945]  We have fish oil, children's fish oil, and ultimate krill oil.
[00:58:33.085 --> 00:58:36.968]  It's totally full of the bottle, and it is the strongest, purest fish oil.
[00:58:37.088 --> 00:58:37.549]  Krill oil.
[00:58:37.609 --> 00:58:44.194]  And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[00:58:44.395 --> 00:58:50.099]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[00:58:50.139 --> 00:58:52.401]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:53.402]  This is not it.
[00:58:53.683 --> 00:58:55.124]  We went to one of the top firms in the
[00:58:55.444 --> 00:58:55.924]  I think?
[00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:16.851]  By the way, I'm not hyping this, folks.
[00:59:17.052 --> 00:59:19.794]  This is the best krill oil we could find.
[00:59:20.214 --> 00:59:21.015]  This is the best.
[00:59:21.075 --> 00:59:22.396]  I can't even just look at that.
[00:59:22.516 --> 00:59:25.339]  It's supposed to be red, folks, because that's the essence of the krill.
[00:59:25.359 --> 00:59:28.021]  I mean, there's probably like 100 krill going into each one of these.
[00:59:28.241 --> 00:59:31.664]  And again, I'm not going to call this a drug, because drugs are a ripoff of what God made.
[00:59:31.964 --> 00:59:34.465]  You take two of these before you go to bed at night.
[00:59:34.605 --> 00:59:36.605]  I would do it with your dinner if you don't want to get fish burps.
[00:59:36.645 --> 00:59:39.526]  Because, again, they've got the fish oil and said, oh, this doesn't have the fish flavor.
[00:59:39.546 --> 00:59:41.027]  Because they boiled the hell out of it.
[00:59:41.067 --> 00:59:42.667]  It isn't there anymore, folks.
[00:59:42.707 --> 00:59:44.207]  You got to deal with the fish burps.
[00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:44.988]  This stuff's powerful.
[00:59:45.028 --> 00:59:45.808]  Just look at that.
[00:59:45.888 --> 00:59:48.028]  Can the camera pick up just how pretty those are?
[00:59:48.189 --> 00:59:50.769]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:54.750 --> 01:00:00.652]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.198 --> 01:00:15.559]  Alright, welcome back.
[01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:20.022]  Will Johnson sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.422 --> 01:00:23.324]  You know, I took a picture and I
[01:00:39.735 --> 01:00:43.616]  I posted the picture for me here in the studio, and I just put it on Facebook.
[01:00:44.416 --> 01:00:47.297]  And in the picture, you can't really see where I'm at or anything.
[01:00:47.357 --> 01:00:59.619]  As I said, it's, you know, actually, my better half put a comment out there about the show being the most banned show in the world.
[01:01:00.279 --> 01:01:04.220]  And I just tried to put another comment out here, and I abbreviated it.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.001]  I put iw.com for its last show, because a lot of people are asking about the link.
[01:01:10.225 --> 01:01:14.187]  So, and Facebook is not allowing me to do that, even.
[01:01:15.248 --> 01:01:20.531]  It just came back when I tried to post it, it just came back and says, you cannot post this.
[01:01:21.691 --> 01:01:27.034]  So, the censorship is at an all-time high.
[01:01:27.254 --> 01:01:37.880]  I mean, what was it, over a year ago, was it August 6th last year, InfoWars was banned from all the socialist media platforms, all in the same day?
[01:01:39.116 --> 01:01:42.037]  You know, and it's just a coincidence that they all did it the same day?
[01:01:44.358 --> 01:01:45.098]  How did that happen?
[01:01:45.758 --> 01:01:47.359]  So, did they pick up the phone call?
[01:01:47.839 --> 01:02:00.463]  Twitter called Google, and Google called Facebook, Facebook called Apple, and then they just went out on their rounds and called the different socialist media outlets and said, OK, now we're going to pull the plug on them.
[01:02:03.103 --> 01:02:04.924]  Have you not paid attention?
[01:02:06.284 --> 01:02:07.425]  This is, to me,
[01:02:08.519 --> 01:02:14.500]  These socialist media outlets that are on the internet remind me of Nazi Germany.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:27.722]  And then they want to call white people neo-Nazis and everyone else the fascists, but what they're doing is nothing different than the neo-Nazi Germany was doing.
[01:02:28.462 --> 01:02:37.464]  And instead of taking physical books, taking them out into the field and burning them, what they're doing today, what they're doing today
[01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:43.194]  is that they're taking digital books and burning them.
[01:02:43.974 --> 01:02:45.015]  And that's what they did here.
[01:02:46.116 --> 01:02:56.204]  So why would anybody support a socialist entity that is trying to take away Americans' voice?
[01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:57.630]  Right?
[01:02:58.211 --> 01:02:58.871]  Think about that.
[01:02:59.291 --> 01:03:03.354]  You have people are saying, yes, Alex Jones should be removed.
[01:03:03.774 --> 01:03:04.894]  He should be removed.
[01:03:05.655 --> 01:03:11.458]  And then they want to, if you say Alex Jones on these socialist media platforms, there's your subject to get banned.
[01:03:12.439 --> 01:03:15.200]  They're subject to delete your Facebook.
[01:03:16.821 --> 01:03:19.943]  They're going to digitally burn your book.
[01:03:20.483 --> 01:03:21.624]  And it's not just Facebook.
[01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:22.945]  Google,
[01:03:24.281 --> 01:03:37.312]  You know, they had, they used to, Google had, what was it called, Google Plus, where people can go on there and they can do comments and different things like that, but I think they've since, people didn't really gravitate to it, so they didn't, there's not too much of it around.
[01:03:38.533 --> 01:03:51.123]  But you still have Twitter, you still have Fascist Book, you still have YouTube, where a lot of people communicate and do videos, and you have these socialist media outlets that are blocking conservatives.
[01:03:52.697 --> 01:03:57.300]  Now, just to be clear, they have blocked some liberals, some that are on the left.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.823]  And the only time they get blocked is when they start waking up.
[01:04:01.303 --> 01:04:06.947]  When they start waking up to what's happening, then these socialist media outlets will start blocking them.
[01:04:07.747 --> 01:04:09.348]  They didn't experience it before then.
[01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:18.034]  And so as long as you're anti-American, as long as you're anti-Trump, as long as you're anti-InfoWars.com, then they will let you thrive.
[01:04:18.335 --> 01:04:19.555]  They will even help you
[01:04:20.481 --> 01:04:21.162]  Succeed!
[01:04:21.822 --> 01:04:24.944]  They will even push your videos above and beyond!
[01:04:27.727 --> 01:04:32.470]  It is crazy what's happening in America in this second civil war.
[01:04:33.511 --> 01:04:37.254]  Right now the battle was primarily on the internet.
[01:04:38.447 --> 01:04:40.148]  Now the battle is going to the streets.
[01:04:41.049 --> 01:04:42.430]  The battle is going to Portland.
[01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:45.212]  The battle is in El Paso.
[01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:50.095]  The battle is wherever these leftists can get people to go and be destructive.
[01:04:50.796 --> 01:04:51.836]  You've got to wake up.
[01:04:52.337 --> 01:04:54.158]  Next, we're going to have Robert Burns on with us.
[01:04:54.198 --> 01:04:57.200]  He's going to go into great detail about this and much more.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.262]  Will Johnson, this is Infowars.com.
[01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:08.980]  Well today, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[01:05:09.701 --> 01:05:14.550]  I just devoured your cousin InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[01:05:35.708 --> 01:05:40.192]  What in the world's going on here?
[01:06:13.766 --> 01:06:16.508]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:06:16.989 --> 01:06:21.872]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Will Johnson.
[01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:29.238]  Welcome back.
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:40.126]  It is a great privilege and honor to be here again hosting the show for Alex while he's on a well-deserved vacation.
[01:06:41.215 --> 01:06:42.876]  So we're soon.
[01:06:43.537 --> 01:06:44.957]  Let me let me talk about this real quick.
[01:06:46.899 --> 01:06:47.599]  Turbo Force.
[01:06:48.199 --> 01:06:49.540]  You see, I have on orange shoes right here.
[01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:59.647]  I traveled from California to Texas, and it's like a three day drive, especially if you're not.
[01:06:59.927 --> 01:07:02.248]  I had a trailer behind me, so I can't go really fast.
[01:07:02.288 --> 01:07:07.632]  So I'm driving and I love God's country and it's beautiful.
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:10.480]  But being humans, we get tired.
[01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:17.982]  And even just after four hours of driving, and I'm starting to get tired, and I remembered, I said, oh, I have a pack of Turbo Force.
[01:07:19.043 --> 01:07:25.164]  So I reached into my console in my vehicle, and I took out the Turbo Force, and I stopped at a gas station.
[01:07:26.244 --> 01:07:27.625]  And I got me some orange shoes.
[01:07:28.525 --> 01:07:30.725]  They weren't quite this big.
[01:07:30.825 --> 01:07:32.866]  The typical size is a little bit smaller.
[01:07:32.886 --> 01:07:36.627]  And I'll put like half the packet of the Turbo Force in it, because
[01:07:37.412 --> 01:07:40.213]  The stuff is so great and so wonderful, it gets you going.
[01:07:40.693 --> 01:07:44.114]  But there's quite a bit in this one, so I'm going to put the whole thing in this one.
[01:07:45.134 --> 01:07:53.056]  And when I was driving from California to Texas, I took the Turboforce and I put it in orange shoes.
[01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:55.377]  And I took it and I shook it up.
[01:07:57.257 --> 01:08:01.279]  Hear that?
[01:08:01.639 --> 01:08:02.499]  Get in there real good.
[01:08:03.865 --> 01:08:04.725]  And you know what's amazing?
[01:08:04.805 --> 01:08:07.086]  It actually, it heightens the taste.
[01:08:07.246 --> 01:08:08.167]  I mean, I really like it.
[01:08:08.787 --> 01:08:18.150]  I mean, I'm a big fan of orange juice already, but yeah, it's, I mean, it's, it's really good.
[01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:18.690]  Let me see.
[01:08:23.772 --> 01:08:24.192]  Wow.
[01:08:25.673 --> 01:08:28.154]  It's like energy immediately.
[01:08:33.513 --> 01:08:34.734]  I can't believe, you know what?
[01:08:35.494 --> 01:08:44.638]  Maybe InfoWars should sell orange shoes with the TurboForce in it because the way it tastes, it's almost like it just brightens up the orange shoes.
[01:08:45.579 --> 01:08:49.360]  It gives it more energy in the orange shoes itself, if that makes sense.
[01:08:50.461 --> 01:08:53.382]  But TurboForce, here I got another packet here, let me show it.
[01:08:54.283 --> 01:09:00.566]  The TurboForce at InfoWarsStore.com, most of the time they keep it on sale.
[01:09:01.451 --> 01:09:04.091]  And I'm like, how do they, how are they able to do that?
[01:09:04.652 --> 01:09:06.952]  They keep it on sale for so long.
[01:09:07.072 --> 01:09:17.874]  And I think, now I've never been told this, but I think the main reason why they keep it on sale and they keep the price so low is that so people will try it.
[01:09:17.934 --> 01:09:19.174]  I mean, it's a whole box full.
[01:09:19.214 --> 01:09:19.874]  Is it 30 bucks?
[01:09:19.934 --> 01:09:20.615]  Right at 30 bucks, $29.95.
[01:09:20.655 --> 01:09:21.475]  You get it and you try it.
[01:09:21.495 --> 01:09:21.475]  $29.98.
[01:09:21.515 --> 01:09:24.435]  30 bucks.
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:29.960]  30 bucks.
[01:09:30.601 --> 01:09:33.502]  Today's prices, you could spend that just going to McDonald's.
[01:09:34.523 --> 01:09:37.885]  But 30 bucks, you get it, and you will be amazed.
[01:09:38.325 --> 01:09:39.866]  So, you know, I went through, and I...
[01:09:41.561 --> 01:09:43.142]  I think I have a copy somewhere here.
[01:09:44.482 --> 01:09:47.424]  Maybe not, but I went through and I always like looking at the reviews.
[01:09:48.124 --> 01:09:54.346]  Because I talk about the different reviews that's going on with the people who buy the Turboforce.
[01:09:54.967 --> 01:09:58.108]  And just to see if the reviews are similar to mine.
[01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:09.293]  And ever since I've been talking about the Orange Juice with Turboforce, I've actually seen people comment on there about them taking Turboforce with the Orange Juice.
[01:10:10.872 --> 01:10:17.519]  Yeah, there's one with Johnny Boy, and he says, he says, I'm absolutely addicted to this amazing product.
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:24.345]  Also a member of the Houston Info Wars Army, as well as the daily
[01:10:25.404 --> 01:10:26.345]  Distance runner.
[01:10:27.146 --> 01:10:29.188]  I live on this stuff.
[01:10:29.888 --> 01:10:33.552]  And he says, personally, he said, personally, I'm not crazy about the taste.
[01:10:33.832 --> 01:10:35.734]  Now, just in water, it is pretty strong.
[01:10:36.294 --> 01:10:39.057]  And but I like it in hot water because I drink it like tea.
[01:10:39.097 --> 01:10:42.440]  But he says, personally, I'm not crazy about the taste.
[01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:48.726]  So usually he'll mix it into Powerade or orange juice.
[01:10:49.227 --> 01:10:50.408]  See, and that's exactly what I did.
[01:10:53.866 --> 01:10:55.875]  You've got to do it, and I encourage anyone.
[01:10:56.644 --> 01:10:58.785]  Go to InfowarsStore.com right now.
[01:10:59.265 --> 01:11:00.285]  Leave a comment.
[01:11:00.585 --> 01:11:01.645]  Try it with orange juice.
[01:11:02.085 --> 01:11:02.906]  Leave a comment.
[01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:04.186]  Let me know.
[01:11:04.666 --> 01:11:08.087]  And I would love to get your comment and read it online.
[01:11:08.247 --> 01:11:09.007]  Read it on the air.
[01:11:09.467 --> 01:11:14.008]  God willing, I will be in this chair again if God allows me to be here.
[01:11:14.448 --> 01:11:15.709]  So get the Turbo Force today.
[01:11:15.769 --> 01:11:17.009]  InfowarsStore.com.
[01:11:17.389 --> 01:11:20.490]  Now, the next one that I'm going to get, I haven't purchased it yet.
[01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:23.551]  Actually, once I leave the studio, I'm going to go purchase
[01:11:24.611 --> 01:11:25.292]  We're good to go!
[01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:58.656]  The DNA Force has so many benefits, and I want to take it, I'm going to get it today, and I'm going to, once I get it and I take it, then I'm going to come back and I'm going to tell everyone my personal experience.
[01:11:58.836 --> 01:12:00.317]  Because I think that's what people want to hear.
[01:12:00.337 --> 01:12:12.485]  Because I can go down the long line list of everything, the reasons why you should take it based on the documentation that they have in there, but I like to do it based on my personal experience, just like the Turbo Force.
[01:12:14.417 --> 01:12:14.837]  Sounds good.
[01:12:15.278 --> 01:12:15.478]  All right.
[01:12:16.318 --> 01:12:23.724]  So, while we're waiting for Mr. Burns to join us, I want to go to another clip that I had here, and I think we have time.
[01:12:25.525 --> 01:12:30.889]  Before Veritas, James O'Keefe came on.
[01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:33.371]  Actually, let me talk about that real quick.
[01:12:34.331 --> 01:12:43.398]  Were James O'Keefe and Veritas Google attacking this gentleman for exposing them for what they're doing?
[01:12:45.643 --> 01:12:47.263]  Why would that not terrify people?
[01:12:47.343 --> 01:12:49.844]  How is it that Google has so much power?
[01:12:50.504 --> 01:12:52.625]  And what did Google tell?
[01:12:52.885 --> 01:12:56.405]  Okay, so Google told the police department a wellness check.
[01:12:57.906 --> 01:13:01.087]  A wellness check to go see, to go check on him.
[01:13:02.687 --> 01:13:04.247]  And you know, they're like looking at him.
[01:13:04.367 --> 01:13:07.268]  Okay, so a wellness check is just walking up to him, right?
[01:13:07.328 --> 01:13:07.688]  Why not?
[01:13:08.008 --> 01:13:09.569]  Why does he have to hold his hands up?
[01:13:10.729 --> 01:13:11.169]  Don't shoot.
[01:13:12.307 --> 01:13:13.468]  How does he get in that position?
[01:13:13.508 --> 01:13:16.470]  Because Google asked for them to go do a wellness check.
[01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:25.537]  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but a wellness check is to go check on someone's well-being to make sure that they're okay, right?
[01:13:26.157 --> 01:13:40.728]  But I think in this case, Google is trying to build up documentation or build up a case against him to say that he may be, you know, off his rocker or he may be mentally disturbed, but he was getting paid
[01:13:41.528 --> 01:13:43.849]  A quarter million dollars a year from Google.
[01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:48.912]  So you mean to tell me that Google is hiring people that's mentally unstable?
[01:13:49.552 --> 01:13:59.157]  Or they're just saying that now you're mentally unstable because you shared inside documents that prove what Google and what all of us have been believing?
[01:14:00.293 --> 01:14:03.935]  Why is Google trying to change the outcome of the 2020 election?
[01:14:04.275 --> 01:14:05.836]  That's the most important thing.
[01:14:06.257 --> 01:14:07.757]  And who gave them this power?
[01:14:08.138 --> 01:14:11.640]  Why do they, why, who's allowing them to do that?
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:16.923]  And I'm going to tell you, it is us the American people that has allowed Google to do this.
[01:14:17.223 --> 01:14:18.464]  And I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:14:19.244 --> 01:14:28.630]  I used to work in IT, and I loved using Google because if I need to find the answer to something, I could Google it, and some super geek out there has put the solution on Google.
[01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:34.014]  Be it in a YouTube video, be it in a documentation, you can find it via Google.
[01:14:35.194 --> 01:14:39.257]  And Google knew, and they know exactly what they've done.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:46.804]  And because they don't like somebody, because they don't like the President of the United States, that the American people elected.
[01:14:47.044 --> 01:14:51.767]  So basically they're saying that the American people, you don't understand what you did.
[01:14:52.347 --> 01:14:57.410]  So we're going to try everything we can to reverse the will of the American people.
[01:14:57.670 --> 01:15:03.794]  The American people should not be allowed to select the sitting President of the United States.
[01:15:04.514 --> 01:15:05.794]  And that's exactly what they're saying.
[01:15:06.114 --> 01:15:07.375]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:15:07.735 --> 01:15:08.615]  That's their agenda.
[01:15:09.135 --> 01:15:13.456]  They want a socialist, communist, democrat to run this country.
[01:15:13.776 --> 01:15:14.576]  Into the ground.
[01:15:16.336 --> 01:15:19.457]  Which is amazing to me because Google resides in America.
[01:15:19.717 --> 01:15:20.817]  So I guess, what does that mean?
[01:15:21.097 --> 01:15:24.478]  Google, they get to stay at the top of the food chain?
[01:15:25.338 --> 01:15:28.619]  Because at some point, they're gonna come for Google as well.
[01:15:29.824 --> 01:15:32.426]  Google is helping these socialists right now to take them out.
[01:15:32.766 --> 01:15:33.687]  To take us out.
[01:15:34.127 --> 01:15:36.109]  But they're going to come for you as well, Google.
[01:15:36.249 --> 01:15:38.951]  Elizabeth Warren, she stopped talking about it here lately.
[01:15:39.692 --> 01:15:42.814]  But even Elizabeth Warren wants to go after you.
[01:15:44.095 --> 01:15:45.936]  Did someone at Google get to Elizabeth Warren?
[01:15:47.137 --> 01:15:48.138]  You have to ask that question.
[01:15:48.198 --> 01:15:48.578]  Did they?
[01:15:49.199 --> 01:15:49.619]  Did they?
[01:15:49.639 --> 01:15:52.501]  Because she's not talking about it any longer.
[01:15:52.561 --> 01:15:54.063]  I haven't heard her say anything in a while.
[01:15:54.523 --> 01:15:55.724]  Alright, my name is Will Johnson.
[01:15:55.744 --> 01:15:57.705]  This is Infowars.com.
[01:15:58.026 --> 01:15:59.447]  We'll be back with Mr. Burns.
[01:16:07.691 --> 01:16:10.993]  Ladies and gentlemen, World War 4 is upon us.
[01:16:11.933 --> 01:16:12.894]  It's an economic war.
[01:16:13.554 --> 01:16:14.835]  It's a trade war.
[01:16:15.435 --> 01:16:16.536]  It's a proxy war.
[01:16:16.756 --> 01:16:17.716]  It's regional wars.
[01:16:17.957 --> 01:16:18.897]  It's a culture war.
[01:16:18.937 --> 01:16:21.959]  I'm going to just give you a brief gestalt lay history.
[01:16:22.019 --> 01:16:27.562]  Anybody can go research this for yourself about how Trump is launching via India a proxy war.
[01:16:27.662 --> 01:16:30.683]  So to understand what Trump's doing, we have to understand the history of it.
[01:16:30.703 --> 01:16:31.604]  1,400 years ago, Mohammed
[01:16:34.165 --> 01:16:34.785]  He's right here.
[01:16:35.006 --> 01:16:46.072]  He takes over the key crossroads of the caravans coming out of the empire of India that stretched all the way over to Iran and all the way into China.
[01:16:46.513 --> 01:16:49.835]  India was the dominant force, not China, not Japan at that time.
[01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:53.397]  They were the most powerful empire in the East and were expanding trade.
[01:16:53.437 --> 01:16:54.938]  So that's what's happening in India.
[01:16:55.018 --> 01:17:03.303]  Within just a few hundred years of Muhammad's death, they have already taken over what's Pakistan today, pushed the Indian empire back, taken over and surrounded India.
[01:17:04.747 --> 01:17:08.868]  You have Kashmir that is the birthplace of the Indian culture and set up India.
[01:17:08.948 --> 01:17:11.689]  Folks floated in from all over the world because there was so much prosperity in that area.
[01:17:11.789 --> 01:17:13.150]  So, all of that's going on.
[01:17:13.210 --> 01:17:14.110]  That's just some of the background.
[01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:15.771]  So, China is over here.
[01:17:16.051 --> 01:17:17.491]  They're starting to go into Hong Kong.
[01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:18.512]  They're starting to go into Taiwan.
[01:17:18.932 --> 01:17:20.192]  They're threatening Japan.
[01:17:20.272 --> 01:17:24.153]  They're building islands all over the place, way down here, even by the Philippines.
[01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:25.534]  The Philippines is having to threaten them now.
[01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:28.876]  They're sending in their companies that are really paramilitary and others.
[01:17:28.996 --> 01:17:30.176]  They're taking over the colleges.
[01:17:30.196 --> 01:17:31.797]  They're buying everybody off just like they're doing here.
[01:17:31.857 --> 01:17:32.718]  They're buying off the media.
[01:17:32.758 --> 01:17:40.522]  They're using all this incredible money they've been given by us, giving trade superiority of $900 billion a year for decades, to be able to just take over the planet.
[01:17:40.802 --> 01:17:42.323]  Again, they were given $98 billion.
[01:17:43.263 --> 01:17:44.144]  percent of rare minerals.
[01:17:44.164 --> 01:17:45.525]  You just don't get that.
[01:17:45.825 --> 01:17:47.767]  No one else is allowed by the globalists to operate.
[01:17:47.787 --> 01:17:48.367]  They sue you.
[01:17:48.387 --> 01:17:49.408]  The UN comes after you.
[01:17:49.568 --> 01:17:52.391]  China is able to do human clones, take people's organs.
[01:17:52.411 --> 01:17:53.612]  They just do whatever the hell they want.
[01:17:53.652 --> 01:17:56.955]  They're God, basically, because they're an evil Qaikom force feeding on their own people.
[01:17:56.975 --> 01:17:59.477]  They're the model of the global technocracy the NWO wants.
[01:17:59.637 --> 01:18:03.040]  So Trump and Japan and South Korea and others form an alliance.
[01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:06.121]  As soon as Trump gets elected, he says his new order is a screwjob for everybody.
[01:18:06.382 --> 01:18:08.322]  We're not going along with it, including the Chinese people.
[01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:09.183]  They don't like it.
[01:18:09.283 --> 01:18:11.904]  He meets with the leader of India.
[01:18:12.124 --> 01:18:12.725]  He hugs him.
[01:18:12.845 --> 01:18:16.346]  He says, hey, if China gives you problems, I keep trying to take over Kashmir.
[01:18:16.406 --> 01:18:23.029]  But at 49, the UN made India create an autonomous zone, which then now China has come in and openly taken over about a third of the country.
[01:18:23.049 --> 01:18:28.412]  The Islamists are pouring in, now pushing to the new borders of India and trying to take India proper over itself.
[01:18:28.672 --> 01:18:31.273]  And again, leftist media calls it Indian extremism.
[01:18:31.653 --> 01:18:33.254]  They call him a Hindu extremist.
[01:18:33.654 --> 01:18:36.955]  Even though the Pakistanis were Indians until the Islamists took it over.
[01:18:36.975 --> 01:18:38.976]  There's Hindu and Buddhist temples all over Pakistan.
[01:18:38.996 --> 01:18:39.576]  Well, there were.
[01:18:39.696 --> 01:18:40.757]  The Muslims blew them all up.
[01:18:40.837 --> 01:18:42.457]  So, all of this is happening.
[01:18:42.698 --> 01:18:43.778]  All of this is going on.
[01:18:43.838 --> 01:18:47.279]  And then once they take your country over, they remove any symbols you ever existed.
[01:18:47.339 --> 01:18:48.660]  They erase that they were Indians.
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.161]  So, you've got China bordering.
[01:18:51.761 --> 01:18:53.301]  Right here in what is Kashmir.
[01:18:53.601 --> 01:18:58.062]  And so Trump green-lighted, go ahead, you're not under that UN thing anymore, go in.
[01:18:58.202 --> 01:19:03.404]  Within hours of what happened with the currency devaluation, within hours, they sent the troops in.
[01:19:03.504 --> 01:19:04.284]  The Indians did.
[01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:07.465]  And I want to be clear, India didn't invade Kashmir.
[01:19:07.565 --> 01:19:12.566]  Kashmir was stolen from it when the British Empire was dissolving and becoming the New World Order.
[01:19:12.586 --> 01:19:14.086]  Because India never really got its freedom.
[01:19:14.226 --> 01:19:18.387]  Under their current leader, India is, to a certain extent, actually becoming independent, finally.
[01:19:18.667 --> 01:19:33.659]  So, you got China right here, and this is the key piece in the whole chessboard, is this whole fight going on over India, because you'll control the trade routes, you'll control the water, you'll control everything into Burma and Thailand and Vietnam and the Philippines, who've all had wars with China.
[01:19:33.799 --> 01:19:44.388]  China is completely expansionist, completely out of control, and so Trump has turned the Indians loose to be on their flank and to let China know you're now in a vice grip, and this is the stuff that World War IV is
[01:19:44.608 --> 01:19:46.729]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:27.438 --> 01:20:28.339]  Welcome back!
[01:20:28.479 --> 01:20:29.139]  Infowars.com.
[01:20:29.179 --> 01:20:31.161]  We have Mr. Burns on with us.
[01:20:37.304 --> 01:20:47.593]  Now Mr. Burns, I've watched Mr. Burns and I listen to him talk and it's just like he has like a wealth of knowledge just walking around on two feet and it's amazing.
[01:20:49.134 --> 01:21:03.907]  I've learned so much just listening to him and he has so many points that are on point and it's just like how is it even possible that someone has all of this together like this and it's a real honor and pleasure to talk to you again Mr. Burns.
[01:21:05.205 --> 01:21:05.886]  Hey, happy to be here.
[01:21:06.267 --> 01:21:06.847]  Yeah, cool.
[01:21:07.348 --> 01:21:13.677]  So did you see the video with the Veritas, but the Google and the whole the whole document dump?
[01:21:14.841 --> 01:21:15.121]  I did.
[01:21:15.181 --> 01:21:16.721]  I mean, it's another whistleblower.
[01:21:17.022 --> 01:21:27.404]  Not only that, Sarah Carter reported that this information has been turned over to the Department of Justice as part of their antitrust investigation, as evidence and proof of that antitrust investigation.
[01:21:27.884 --> 01:21:33.745]  So at multiple levels, it's significant and consequential, and it's revelatory at the scope of it.
[01:21:34.086 --> 01:21:40.027]  It's amazing what Veritas is doing, and it shows the degree to which what Google is doing is so egregious.
[01:21:40.547 --> 01:21:43.008]  That whistleblowers like this are willing to come forward.
[01:21:43.348 --> 01:21:44.849]  So it's extraordinary.
[01:21:45.249 --> 01:21:47.809]  It's an amazing time to be alive in that sense.
[01:21:48.190 --> 01:21:51.251]  And these big tech oligarchs think they're beyond the law and above the law.
[01:21:51.591 --> 01:22:07.036]  And I hate the fact that the president had Attorney General Barr come out and announce a full scale, wholesale antitrust investigation, not just a potential antitrust investigation, not just a possible review, but a Microsoft level antitrust investigation.
[01:22:07.557 --> 01:22:22.539]  And Bill Gates just was on the other day saying that the antitrust investigation is the main reason why Microsoft never developed into a full-scale monopoly in the mobile app space because they were so concerned with the antitrust investigation.
[01:22:23.687 --> 01:22:26.589]  They end up not pursuing that to the degree they otherwise actually would have.
[01:22:26.609 --> 01:22:28.291]  And he thinks they would have otherwise dominated it.
[01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:44.063]  So that's why just announcing it, it's not a coincidence that after announcing it, two major Google whistleblowers have both come out and blown the whistle and given inside information and intel that it's critical and essential to breaking up big tech, to taking on big tech that has occurred.
[01:22:44.443 --> 01:22:46.505]  So the president is taking the necessary steps.
[01:22:46.885 --> 01:22:52.289]  He may need to take more steps, but these are the necessary immediate steps that are already paying off.
[01:22:52.689 --> 01:22:57.115]  With the Veritas whistleblower activity taking place in just the last two weeks.
[01:22:57.416 --> 01:22:57.856]  Right.
[01:22:58.157 --> 01:23:04.245]  Mr. Barnes, so let me ask you, do you think the Attorney General Barr is actually going to do anything?
[01:23:05.117 --> 01:23:07.759]  Do you think that it's going to sit on it and gather more information?
[01:23:07.779 --> 01:23:11.561]  The only reason why I ask that question because we've seen Hillary Clinton.
[01:23:11.581 --> 01:23:12.642]  She's still walking around.
[01:23:13.022 --> 01:23:13.983]  Nothing's happened to her.
[01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:15.824]  Comey, he leaked information.
[01:23:16.144 --> 01:23:17.145]  Nothing happened to her.
[01:23:17.485 --> 01:23:25.371]  President Trump has already mentioned, you know, had the summit about the whole censorship with the socialist tech media out there and nothing has happened.
[01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:26.912]  People are still getting banned.
[01:23:27.172 --> 01:23:28.513]  People are still being censored.
[01:23:28.733 --> 01:23:30.434]  The shadow banning is taking place.
[01:23:30.734 --> 01:23:34.577]  You're still being threatened to be removed if not deleted.
[01:23:35.437 --> 01:23:37.979]  Dizzily burned from these platforms.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.582]  Do you think something's actually going to happen?
[01:23:42.123 --> 01:23:44.305]  I think something is happening in that sense.
[01:23:44.405 --> 01:23:50.830]  So before there was talk of it, but there's been a steady escalation of activity by the executive branch.
[01:23:51.291 --> 01:23:53.553]  So it started off with sort of a warning.
[01:23:53.573 --> 01:23:57.856]  Then it was Trump using the bully pulpit to question what big tech was doing.
[01:23:58.377 --> 01:24:03.341]  Then that went even further with the announcement of a review of a possible investigation.
[01:24:03.968 --> 01:24:07.130]  And then Attorney General Barr's announcement of a full inquiry.
[01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:11.052]  And the difference is antitrust full inquiries are rare.
[01:24:11.593 --> 01:24:14.234]  So for them to announce that they're doing a meaningful.
[01:24:14.274 --> 01:24:18.837]  So this is not like the what Sessions was doing with these sort of cover.
[01:24:19.198 --> 01:24:23.980]  Let's have someone look at whether or not the Clinton Foundation investigation was done correctly.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:24.661]  It's not like that.
[01:24:24.721 --> 01:24:26.282]  This is a full scale investigation.
[01:24:26.781 --> 01:24:28.783]  Any trust lawyers understand its consequence.
[01:24:29.143 --> 01:24:29.924]  It means the U.S.
[01:24:29.944 --> 01:24:34.588]  government is highly likely to go forward with both civil and criminal action.
[01:24:35.268 --> 01:24:46.358]  And Google cannot afford to continue to have these kind of people give inside intel and information to the Department of Justice to go public with their whistleblowing activity continuously.
[01:24:46.818 --> 01:24:57.302]  Because what it reveals is that forever Google has been saying that they are not manipulating their algorithm for partisan purposes and they're not manipulating their algorithm against economic competitors.
[01:24:57.822 --> 01:25:06.485]  But what this evidence that came out today showed is that they are doing both and that they have made extensive and expansive efforts into doing both.
[01:25:07.805 --> 01:25:15.008]  That would clearly and plainly violate antitrust laws in ways that could easily bankrupt them if the Department of Justice pursues that path.
[01:25:15.561 --> 01:25:27.253]  I think Attorney General Barr has shown a willingness and a readiness to pursue it, and the President's willingness and a readiness to pursue it, that I think the only thing that could salvage Big Tech is if they do not meddle in the 2020 election.
[01:25:28.524 --> 01:25:29.485]  But they're already doing that.
[01:25:29.665 --> 01:25:36.612]  I mean, for example, just yesterday, I was on YouTube, which is owned by Google, and they have what they call suggested search terms.
[01:25:37.133 --> 01:25:38.554]  And I was just curious.
[01:25:38.574 --> 01:25:43.779]  I wonder what the Clinton body count documentaries are now currently on YouTube.
[01:25:43.799 --> 01:25:47.002]  So I searched Clinton body count in the search suggestion box.
[01:25:47.623 --> 01:25:48.484]  Nothing came up at all.
[01:25:48.524 --> 01:25:51.407]  Instead, what came up was Clinton body shop reviews.
[01:25:52.051 --> 01:25:52.612]  That was it.
[01:25:52.932 --> 01:25:54.453]  That was YouTube's recommendation.
[01:25:54.473 --> 01:26:03.201]  Is that you go somewhere to find that, and Clinton, you know, there's a lot of little towns called Clinton, New York, other places, that you can get a body count review, that clearly that's what you were looking for.
[01:26:03.221 --> 01:26:08.386]  That YouTube doesn't know and Google doesn't know what this Clinton body count thing is all about.
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.843]  So I think that's the scope of it.
[01:26:11.883 --> 01:26:12.824]  That's the scale of it.
[01:26:13.164 --> 01:26:18.511]  It shows the degree to which, I mean, there you can see right there, they're doing it live time.
[01:26:18.911 --> 01:26:19.472]  That's Google.
[01:26:19.492 --> 01:26:22.295]  That proves that it's Google, right?
[01:26:22.315 --> 01:26:25.559]  Yeah, when you type in count, it's not even populating anything.
[01:26:25.839 --> 01:26:26.720]  So they're perfectly clear.
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:26.940]  Exactly.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:34.826]  And I can imagine thousands upon thousands, if not millions of people are searching the Clinton body count, body bags, you know.
[01:26:35.206 --> 01:26:35.807]  Let me ask you this.
[01:26:35.847 --> 01:26:47.555]  Do you think, do you think with inside of Google that they're probably going to do a purge of the people that they think might be, you know, whistleblowers or, you know, if they've ever hinted to it?
[01:26:47.575 --> 01:26:49.537]  I'm just curious.
[01:26:50.257 --> 01:26:50.678]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:26:50.698 --> 01:26:53.500]  The thing is in California, they have to be very, very careful.
[01:26:53.888 --> 01:27:06.273]  So one of the reasons why these people are going forward, and going forward in a public way, is that California prohibits retaliation, or firing, or any employment discrimination against someone because they're a whistleblower.
[01:27:06.634 --> 01:27:12.496]  So if you're at Google right now, the best way to protect yourself job-wise is to blow the whistle.
[01:27:12.916 --> 01:27:14.477]  Because then Google can do nothing.
[01:27:14.817 --> 01:27:18.779]  And if they do do anything, you have an easy lawsuit for major damages.
[01:27:19.339 --> 01:27:28.925]  So that's why the smart thing to do for anybody at Google, even if they didn't want to be a whistleblower, but they just want employment security, the best way to get employment security, become a whistleblower.
[01:27:29.225 --> 01:27:34.829]  You become a whistleblower in California, and any employer who terminates you, the size and scale of Google,
[01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:38.911]  They're going to be subject to unique liability and responsibility.
[01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:42.092]  And there are a lot of whistleblower cases in California.
[01:27:42.432 --> 01:27:43.733]  I've litigated several of them.
[01:27:44.153 --> 01:27:51.196]  And they can lead to big damages awards because juries don't like it when employers take any punitive or retaliatory action against an employee.
[01:27:51.576 --> 01:27:55.978]  So, for example, there are some smart employees that might think they're in employment trouble or difficulty.
[01:27:56.458 --> 01:28:00.320]  And one of the things you do in California is when you find something that's wrong with your employer,
[01:28:00.861 --> 01:28:07.673]  And you run and blow the whistle on it, and now all of a sudden the employer who might have been planning on firing you independently, now is in a troublesome situation.
[01:28:08.177 --> 01:28:21.205]  So any smart employee at Google right now, or any of the California big tech companies, the best way to have guaranteed employment security is find something that they're doing illicitly and blow the whistle on it.
[01:28:21.485 --> 01:28:35.753]  Whether it's political partisan manipulation or discrimination against other economic competitors, antitrust activity, anti-Trump activity, whatever it is, blow the whistle now and you can have full employment economic security moving forward.
[01:28:36.198 --> 01:28:37.039]  Yeah, I see that.
[01:28:37.119 --> 01:28:47.028]  You know, I was working at a tech job in Silicon Valley, and my boss, he expressed how much he hated President Trump during our team meetings.
[01:28:47.708 --> 01:28:48.369]  Constantly!
[01:28:48.689 --> 01:28:57.457]  And I just had to be tight-lipped because I had a family to feed, and I didn't want to... And I talk out now, but it's crazy, but I completely see that.
[01:28:57.978 --> 01:29:00.500]  This is Infowars.com.
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:01.461]  We'll be back after this.
[01:29:02.699 --> 01:29:07.624]  President Trump has reacted to Epstein's death in what is sadly a very unsurprising way.
[01:29:08.084 --> 01:29:09.866]  He is spreading a conspiracy theory.
[01:29:09.946 --> 01:29:16.212]  Tying the death of pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in prison to the president's former political rivals, the Clintons.
[01:29:16.392 --> 01:29:21.316]  The president retweeting a theory without evidence that implicates the Clintons in Epstein's death.
[01:29:21.597 --> 01:29:22.397]  Let that sink in.
[01:29:23.305 --> 01:29:28.351]  This would be like Gerald Ford or Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan claiming that LBJ had Kennedy killed.
[01:29:28.591 --> 01:29:35.159]  Now, the president is helping to spread an outrageous false story about Epstein's death being tied to the Clintons.
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:42.729]  Shortly after Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his jail cell, President Trump retweeted this video from a conservative commentator.
[01:29:43.271 --> 01:29:48.294]  For some odd reason, people that have information on the Clintons end up dead.
[01:29:48.854 --> 01:29:50.755]  And they usually die from suicide.
[01:29:50.815 --> 01:29:51.855]  It's appalling.
[01:29:52.156 --> 01:29:55.357]  I mean, there's no other way to put it.
[01:29:55.417 --> 01:30:04.122]  You have the President of the United States retweeting an unfounded conspiracy theory with no evidence to back it up.
[01:30:04.762 --> 01:30:07.124]  about a former president of the United States.
[01:30:07.204 --> 01:30:12.489]  We have a president now whose Twitter feed is a chief source of disinformation.
[01:30:12.529 --> 01:30:23.640]  This is another example of our president using this position of public trust to attack his political enemies with unfounded conspiracy theories.
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:26.261]  Some extraordinary conspiracy theories.
[01:30:26.341 --> 01:30:27.322]  Conspiracy theories.
[01:30:27.362 --> 01:30:28.082]  Conspiracy theories.
[01:30:28.122 --> 01:30:29.203]  Conspiracy theories.
[01:30:29.243 --> 01:30:30.543]  Conspiracy theories.
[01:30:30.563 --> 01:30:31.644]  Conspiracy theories.
[01:30:31.724 --> 01:30:32.825]  Conspiracy theories.
[01:30:33.005 --> 01:30:37.947]  Untrustworthy and ridiculous, baseless conspiracy theories.
[01:30:37.967 --> 01:30:46.071]  The President of the United States is pushing a dangerous and completely unfounded murder conspiracy theory about his predecessor.
[01:30:46.131 --> 01:30:47.212]  But do you think it's dangerous?
[01:30:47.332 --> 01:30:48.633]  What he's doing is dangerous.
[01:30:48.753 --> 01:30:51.494]  Republican Marco Rubio agrees it's dangerous.
[01:30:51.554 --> 01:30:52.255]  It's dangerous.
[01:30:52.415 --> 01:30:53.776]  Danger is my middle name.
[01:30:53.856 --> 01:30:57.498]  Dangerously claiming that Epstein was murdered by the Clintons?
[01:30:57.678 --> 01:31:02.201]  But there is no evidence at all to support the conspiracy theory the president is fueling.
[01:31:02.221 --> 01:31:09.385]  Marco Rubio says there is evidence Russian bots are now pushing this new conspiracy theory online to further divide Americans.
[01:31:09.625 --> 01:31:15.909]  All three of us, if we tweeted stuff like this in this reckless fashion, we would likely lose our jobs.
[01:31:26.613 --> 01:31:27.846]  Yeah.
[01:31:34.033 --> 01:31:35.774]  Laura in Alabama.
[01:31:35.854 --> 01:31:36.835]  Laura, you're on the air.
[01:31:36.895 --> 01:31:37.175]  Go ahead.
[01:32:03.933 --> 01:32:16.977]  Well, thank you for your kind words, because take that wound gel.
[01:32:17.037 --> 01:32:18.798]  We're the only other company in the U.S.
[01:32:18.958 --> 01:32:23.079]  that has licensed it from the Colorado company that's very famous, that has FDA approval.
[01:32:23.239 --> 01:32:24.159]  It's used in hospitals.
[01:32:24.239 --> 01:32:25.620]  It's sold in pharmacies.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:31.782]  And then we private label it as Silver Wound Gel, which is a pre-gel, tiny bit, covers your hands, everything.
[01:32:32.202 --> 01:32:36.123]  And the disinfects all day long or put it on once you have a cut or something.
[01:32:36.163 --> 01:32:39.603]  Now, it's so super strong, you can't take it internally or it's poisonous.
[01:32:39.743 --> 01:32:43.744]  But yes, it is the strongest FDA over-the-counter silver there is.
[01:32:43.804 --> 01:32:45.244]  So that is one of our best sellers.
[01:32:45.264 --> 01:32:46.204]  People absolutely love it.
[01:32:46.364 --> 01:32:46.705]  Thank you.
[01:32:46.825 --> 01:32:49.365]  And I can tell you this, my neighbor burned his finger a little bit.
[01:32:49.385 --> 01:32:52.946]  We're building a fire outside and I ran inside and got it and put it on his finger.
[01:32:52.986 --> 01:32:56.126]  And he said to me, is this supposed to work instantly and like this?
[01:32:56.326 --> 01:32:57.426]  And I said, yes, sure does.
[01:32:57.526 --> 01:32:59.327]  So it's fantastic stuff.
[01:32:59.387 --> 01:33:00.407]  I highly recommend it.
[01:33:06.397 --> 01:33:20.822]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:20.902 --> 01:33:29.405]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.945 --> 01:33:32.986]  And now, your host, Will Johnson.
[01:33:36.391 --> 01:33:37.351]  All right, welcome back.
[01:33:37.992 --> 01:33:59.599]  We have Mr. Barnes on with us and we've been talking about great detail about Google and the censorship and I consider this warfare because they're doing what they want to break down communications to try to disrupt the normal process of election season and
[01:34:00.475 --> 01:34:13.723]  Mr. Barnes, we were talking about Google and the people working inside of Google and people working inside of Big Tech, and you have a very good point that the best way to save your job is to go ahead and do the whistleblowing.
[01:34:14.343 --> 01:34:23.329]  If you don't agree with what the big, the socialist Big Techs have been doing, then, and you see the information what they're doing, tell it!
[01:34:24.215 --> 01:34:24.455]  Right?
[01:34:25.016 --> 01:34:25.656]  I mean, tell it.
[01:34:25.796 --> 01:34:26.857]  I mean, that's the best way.
[01:34:26.957 --> 01:34:27.638]  And I agree.
[01:34:27.898 --> 01:34:28.619]  I agree with you.
[01:34:28.659 --> 01:34:35.605]  If you see, if you see the corruption, I mean, as a human being, you would imagine that these people would be saying, yes, I got to do it.
[01:34:35.745 --> 01:34:39.829]  Even the gentleman in the video saying he felt a burden lifted off of his soul.
[01:34:41.730 --> 01:34:42.171]  Exactly.
[01:34:42.411 --> 01:34:45.834]  If you want to save your job, you can also save your country.
[01:34:46.194 --> 01:34:50.378]  Blow the whistle on big tech, because that's the best way to do both.
[01:34:51.036 --> 01:34:58.720]  And so I think there's going to be more people who have more intel, who have more information that goes to the intentionality aspect of what Google is up to.
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:04.664]  I think also Google has been very creative at how they've approached certain aspects of their big tech monopoly.
[01:35:04.964 --> 01:35:12.028]  So the way antitrust works, it's when you have an economic monopoly, that by itself does not constitute an antitrust violation.
[01:35:12.489 --> 01:35:17.996]  There's some that say it should, but just legally right now, the courts don't consider that to be an antitrust violation.
[01:35:18.496 --> 01:35:31.953]  It's when you leverage that monopoly power to gain an unfair economic edge over a competitor that that constitutes an antitrust violation for which there are severe consequences under the Sherman Act and other laws.
[01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:43.961]  Including trouble damages and lawsuits, attorney's fees you have to pay, including civil fines that can go into the billions and billions, and of course, criminal prosecution that can completely break up the company.
[01:35:44.381 --> 01:35:51.126]  Antitrust has unique remedies that the court systems are afforded in order to take on people who are violating the antitrust laws.
[01:35:51.526 --> 01:36:01.853]  So in this context, what Google has done is they've levered, they didn't become a 92% monopoly over the search engines by accident, by coincidence, or by natural technological edge.
[01:36:02.273 --> 01:36:13.561]  They achieved it and attained it by using their monopoly power in other areas, like Android, by owning the Android system, and things like it, in order to monopolize other aspects of economic power.
[01:36:13.941 --> 01:36:16.643]  And that, in turn, gives them the political power they have.
[01:36:16.963 --> 01:36:18.485]  So it's how the two things are connected.
[01:36:18.765 --> 01:36:24.749]  Like, people have said, well, just because it's an antitrust case doesn't mean it will do anything about their political discrimination.
[01:36:25.359 --> 01:36:27.960]  Not on its face, but the way it's indirect.
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:33.863]  Because what happens is, without their economic monopoly, they wouldn't be able to have their political monopoly.
[01:36:34.203 --> 01:36:39.466]  Their monopoly over news, their monopoly over information, because the two are so interrelated and integrated.
[01:36:39.986 --> 01:36:45.789]  And so by taking on their economic predominance, you'll be able to take on their political predominance.
[01:36:46.169 --> 01:36:47.489]  So that's why the two are connected.
[01:36:47.770 --> 01:36:52.872]  That's why the president has escalated into that area, because he knows their monetary motivation.
[01:36:53.524 --> 01:36:53.884]  That's right.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.662]  And on Google, InfoWars doesn't even show up on the first page.
[01:37:18.643 --> 01:37:26.107]  Whereas by contrast, InfoWars is almost the only one that shows up in the search results for Bing or DuckDuckGo and always at the top.
[01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:38.975]  So they've been deliberately, back at the time when Google was first hit with an antitrust investigation, for a couple of days, there was somebody at Google who fixed the algorithm so that it was honest and accurate, not deceptive and misleading.
[01:37:39.515 --> 01:37:41.656]  Mr. Barnes, let me ask you a question.
[01:37:59.292 --> 01:38:16.403]  If you're Google execs right now, because I don't know if you saw, I would imagine that you did see the video, right after the 2016 election, a panel of Google execs came up to figure out, and they had a discussion on how they can stop this election from happening again.
[01:38:16.963 --> 01:38:25.228]  And they were thinking, okay, we've got four years to try to figure out how to prevent President Trump from becoming president, starting in 2016.
[01:38:25.348 --> 01:38:27.890]  If you're a Google exec right now,
[01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:32.772]  And one of these that were sitting on that panel and this document dump just took place.
[01:38:33.753 --> 01:38:36.575]  What would you what would be going through your mind right now?
[01:38:37.835 --> 01:38:51.643]  Well, I think there's no doubt that if you're any of the Google board members, you should see escalating trouble that you're not going to be able to contain or control because it's your own people repeatedly going outside the fold to blow the whistle against you.
[01:38:52.124 --> 01:38:54.325]  If you're the legal team, you see escalating risk.
[01:38:55.126 --> 01:39:02.953]  By continuing to meddle in the elections, you're continuing to motivate Trump, to motivate Attorney General Barr, to motivate the Department of Justice to bring action against you.
[01:39:03.474 --> 01:39:17.007]  But in particular, I would worry if I was at Google, aside from stock value and market value over time, I would worry about perjury by high-ranking Google employees before Congress over the past three years.
[01:39:17.532 --> 01:39:24.537]  So one of the utilities of those congressional hearings, which could have been better conducted, could have been far more effective, Congress should have tied it to legislation.
[01:39:24.557 --> 01:39:24.957]  They didn't.
[01:39:25.537 --> 01:39:37.245]  But what was still effective about it was that it set up a lot of potential perjury allegations and accusations against high-ranking big tech individuals, particularly at Google, who denied manipulating their algorithm at all.
[01:39:37.505 --> 01:39:46.031]  And that's just being contradicted today by the whistleblower with documents to prove it, with his own personal testimony to prove it, with his own whistleblowing to prove it.
[01:39:46.852 --> 01:39:56.322]  But on top of that, you have the implication that the various Google employees, including the Google CEO that Alex challenged up in D.C.
[01:39:56.422 --> 01:39:59.646]  just about a year ago, which involved perjury.
[01:39:59.926 --> 01:40:02.909]  They made statements under oath that they were not doing a bunch of stuff.
[01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:05.272]  These documents show that they were, in fact, doing.
[01:40:05.752 --> 01:40:14.376]  So is the CEO's defense going to be that he had no idea what his own company was doing when it appears that this was done in detail, that it was easily available in documents?
[01:40:14.817 --> 01:40:16.017]  Did they suborn perjury?
[01:40:16.097 --> 01:40:17.758]  Did they conspire to commit perjury?
[01:40:18.158 --> 01:40:27.023]  These are crimes, easily prosecutable crimes, and prosecutable crimes against high-ranking Google people, including the Google CEO himself.
[01:40:27.383 --> 01:40:29.624]  So if I was a CEO at Google,
[01:40:30.024 --> 01:40:31.726]  I would be sweating bullets right now.
[01:40:32.126 --> 01:40:34.127]  I would be lawyering up as much as possible.
[01:40:34.448 --> 01:40:38.111]  I'd be looking at exit packages to not be around for when the storm comes.
[01:40:38.611 --> 01:40:40.152]  So I think that will be the aspect.
[01:40:40.492 --> 01:40:46.177]  And they have to meaningfully take action because Big Tech has shown no ability to restrain itself.
[01:40:46.537 --> 01:40:51.301]  It's only going to be restrained by executive action from the executive branch by President Trump.
[01:40:51.461 --> 01:40:52.202]  I agree with you.
[01:40:52.382 --> 01:40:52.882]  And you know what?
[01:40:53.282 --> 01:41:00.908]  I'm wanting President Trump to bring the hammer down on these socialist tech companies because it seemed like they've doubled down on
[01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:02.550]  You know what?
[01:41:22.546 --> 01:41:27.151]  They, and they changed the order of it, and they have President Obama listed first.
[01:41:27.731 --> 01:41:29.714]  Can you, can you guys show it up on the screen for us?
[01:41:30.214 --> 01:41:31.576]  See, I mean, why would you do that?
[01:41:31.976 --> 01:41:38.423]  President of the United States, and they list President Obama first, and then they have President Trump.
[01:41:39.366 --> 01:41:42.628]  And then they have George H.W.
[01:41:42.668 --> 01:41:48.193]  Bush, and then they mix up the order as it goes down a little bit, because then they have Kennedy, then they have Bill Clinton.
[01:41:49.514 --> 01:41:54.958]  Why do you—I mean, just imagine a young child doing a school paper or research.
[01:41:55.618 --> 01:42:00.062]  You know, and they type in President of the United States, they're not going to like look at the dates.
[01:42:00.162 --> 01:42:04.445]  They're going to look at the listing of the presidents and they're going to say, President Obama is president.
[01:42:04.965 --> 01:42:10.710]  You know, I mean, it's such manipulation on a mass scale and most people won't even catch it.
[01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:14.413]  And only reason why I noticed that because about six months ago,
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:23.784]  Google did something similar where they had the list of presidents and they had them all in order, but where President Trump's picture was, they had it blank.
[01:42:24.164 --> 01:42:25.945]  They had his name, but they had his picture blank.
[01:42:26.445 --> 01:42:28.506]  And then like he didn't even exist.
[01:42:28.826 --> 01:42:31.468]  I went over to Bing, Bing showed it correctly.
[01:42:31.788 --> 01:42:33.489]  And Bing is because it's not Google.
[01:42:33.529 --> 01:42:34.509]  A lot of people don't know that.
[01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:35.990]  Because it's not Google.
[01:42:36.810 --> 01:42:40.792]  It's really amazing that these socialist tech companies are doing all of this.
[01:42:41.413 --> 01:42:45.355]  Mr. Burns, I would love to talk to you more after this break, so stay with me.
[01:42:45.655 --> 01:42:52.279]  I want to get your opinion on more of this censorship that's taking place against conservatives and how liberals are being affected by it.
[01:42:52.519 --> 01:42:53.640]  Do liberals even care?
[01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:54.800]  I don't think they do.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:59.843]  They love seeing conservatives being tortured in the Senate.
[01:43:00.563 --> 01:43:01.504]  Infowars.com
[01:43:02.534 --> 01:43:15.248]  There's this theory, I think it's called scatastic terrorism, which is the idea of a leader using the mass media to demonize a particular group, whether it's Jews or immigrants or whomever.
[01:43:16.009 --> 01:43:20.033]  And then what appears to be lone wolf
[01:43:20.954 --> 01:43:31.299]  Individual psychotics attacking that one group, where the individual attack is not predictable, but the general trend of it is predictable.
[01:43:31.459 --> 01:43:42.925]  I think that at the end of the day, especially because this was a white supremacist manifesto, that I want to say with more moral clarity that Donald Trump is responsible for this.
[01:43:43.565 --> 01:43:56.193]  I think the president has to bear some responsibility for creating a culture in the United States around race-baiting, around demonizing people of color, around demonizing immigrants.
[01:43:56.313 --> 01:44:00.295]  We have a president of the United States who has embraced white nationalism.
[01:44:00.435 --> 01:44:04.477]  And now, America is under attack from domestic white nationalist terror.
[01:44:04.597 --> 01:44:05.517]  White nationalist.
[01:44:05.557 --> 01:44:06.637]  White supremacist.
[01:44:06.717 --> 01:44:07.818]  Racist hatred.
[01:44:07.938 --> 01:44:08.798]  White nationalism.
[01:44:09.138 --> 01:44:10.019]  White nationalist violence.
[01:44:10.059 --> 01:44:11.839]  White nationalist terrorism.
[01:44:11.879 --> 01:44:12.760]  White nationalists.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:13.740]  White nationalism.
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:15.281]  White nationalism.
[01:44:15.341 --> 01:44:16.381]  White nationalism.
[01:44:16.561 --> 01:44:18.201]  The president has stoked the flames.
[01:44:18.261 --> 01:44:19.321]  He has emboldened it.
[01:44:19.422 --> 01:44:20.862]  He has given it power.
[01:44:20.942 --> 01:44:22.042]  He has elevated it.
[01:44:22.842 --> 01:44:24.222]  He has coddled it.
[01:44:25.062 --> 01:44:26.423]  And he's got to stop.
[01:44:26.523 --> 01:44:29.203]  This is the environment that the president has created.
[01:44:29.263 --> 01:44:30.303]  He's made it okay.
[01:44:30.423 --> 01:44:34.284]  He is responsible for what is going on.
[01:44:34.764 --> 01:44:40.285]  And he's doing nothing, nothing to stop the carnage and the chaos.
[01:44:40.665 --> 01:44:42.266]  I'm incredibly saddened.
[01:44:42.326 --> 01:44:44.146]  And it's very hard to think about this.
[01:44:46.067 --> 01:44:53.450]  Our president right now is using the same language of racism, of bigotry, and white supremacy.
[01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:54.550]  He is a racist.
[01:44:54.710 --> 01:44:59.312]  Donald Trump talks like a racist, thinks like a racist, makes statements like a racist.
[01:44:59.612 --> 01:45:02.674]  Yeah, he's a racist because racism is as racism does.
[01:45:02.934 --> 01:45:05.375]  He must be held responsible.
[01:45:05.555 --> 01:45:06.756]  It's a national embarrassment.
[01:45:06.776 --> 01:45:13.280]  I mean, who cares how strong our economy is, or how strong our military is, if Americans are killing Americans?
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:17.703]  When you read that manifesto, it looked like it could have been written by a Trump speechwriter.
[01:45:38.132 --> 01:45:40.976]  Nicole in New Jersey wants to talk about GMOs and allergies.
[01:45:41.257 --> 01:45:42.538]  Awesome, thanks for taking my call.
[01:45:42.618 --> 01:45:48.547]  I love InfoWars and what you guys do there, so thank you and the rest of the crew for keeping us up to date with the truth and facts.
[01:45:48.647 --> 01:45:50.690]  Keeping your amygdalas not enlarged.
[01:45:52.684 --> 01:45:54.145]  We're trying, we're trying.
[01:45:54.245 --> 01:45:57.548]  So in New Jersey it's really terrible and I have really, really bad allergies.
[01:45:57.588 --> 01:46:01.650]  So one I want to tell Alex, thank you so much for getting the Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:46:01.730 --> 01:46:06.393]  That has truly saved my life and has given me the ability to not have sinus infections anymore.
[01:46:06.473 --> 01:46:14.179]  So if anybody out there is listening and needs to breathe again and sleep right and not have multiple sinus infections, go for the Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:46:14.299 --> 01:46:15.620]  Wow, so you keep it in your bedroom?
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:15.780]  Yep.
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:17.540]  Yep, yep, yep, I do.
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:21.961]  And I have a couple that I'll be getting for my mom and dad, and then one for my son and his girlfriend.
[01:46:22.101 --> 01:46:24.342]  And New Jersey is just so air polluted, it's disgusting.
[01:46:24.362 --> 01:46:33.604]  I actually live not far from Lockheed Martin, so there was a lot of lawsuits and stuff that went on when our neighborhood was built about the water and possible contaminants in the water.
[01:46:33.624 --> 01:46:39.086]  So it's actually a backwards way of how I found InfoWars, was looking on a natural way to kill my thyroid.
[01:46:39.186 --> 01:46:42.506]  And so the selenium is actually what introduced me to InfoWars.
[01:46:42.526 --> 01:46:44.267]  I was like, where have you guys been my whole life?
[01:46:45.167 --> 01:46:46.669]  Yeah, it was definitely a bonus time.
[01:46:46.989 --> 01:46:48.311]  All right, Nicole, thanks for calling.
[01:46:48.331 --> 01:46:51.314]  We appreciate your support and everything else.
[01:46:51.514 --> 01:46:53.356]  And I might pick up one of those air cleaners.
[01:46:53.376 --> 01:46:54.837]  I have one at my desk, actually.
[01:46:54.917 --> 01:46:56.619]  So maybe I should get one for my house.
[01:46:56.639 --> 01:47:02.124]  Maybe that would help in my bedroom.
[01:47:05.868 --> 01:47:08.531]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:34.019 --> 01:47:35.359]  All right, we are back.
[01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:38.240]  InfoWars.com.
[01:47:40.241 --> 01:47:44.462]  So, I'm hosting the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:44.522 --> 01:47:55.786]  He's out on vacation, but please go to InfoWars.com forward slash show and you will see the lineup of all the shows that are available on InfoWars.com today.
[01:47:56.306 --> 01:48:02.128]  You have David Knight from 8 a.m to 11 a.m, then the Alex Jones Show from 11 a.m to 3 p.m,
[01:48:03.528 --> 01:48:08.709]  And then the War Room, which I've had the honor and pleasure to host a couple of times from 3 p.m.
[01:48:08.749 --> 01:48:09.750]  to 6 p.m.
[01:48:09.970 --> 01:48:10.410]  Central.
[01:48:10.850 --> 01:48:11.750]  All Central Time.
[01:48:12.610 --> 01:48:15.791]  And to my understanding, there's a whole bunch more coming.
[01:48:16.891 --> 01:48:27.114]  All right, let's get back to Mr. Barnes talking about the censorship with Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and all of the socialist tech giants out there.
[01:48:27.374 --> 01:48:29.454]  Socialist media tech giants.
[01:48:30.194 --> 01:48:32.595]  So, Mr. Barnes, let me ask you this.
[01:48:34.088 --> 01:48:45.698]  If you're working at Google and you see this information, do you think, and you alluded to it earlier, that the best thing you can do is go ahead and put the information out?
[01:48:46.644 --> 01:48:55.988]  I don't, but people are afraid because what's to stop Google from doing a wellness check for anybody at this point?
[01:48:56.328 --> 01:48:58.348]  Because to me that is retaliation.
[01:48:58.489 --> 01:48:59.629]  What's to stop them from doing it?
[01:48:59.849 --> 01:49:02.470]  And they're just going to build up a case that you have a mental illness.
[01:49:02.930 --> 01:49:06.792]  And then we do a wellness check on you because you're doing something you shouldn't be doing.
[01:49:07.172 --> 01:49:09.693]  And isn't it, now hasn't it been proven?
[01:49:10.413 --> 01:49:19.716]  That Google has been working with China, and they won't even work with the Pentagon, but yet they're upset because people are putting the truth out?
[01:49:20.997 --> 01:49:21.517]  Well, no doubt.
[01:49:21.557 --> 01:49:31.520]  Peter Thiel has gone public and has disclosed in detail the degree to which Google is involved, and in his view, is borderline treasonous activity.
[01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:36.922]  According to Peter Thiel, who is the founder of PayPal and other big tech companies,
[01:49:37.242 --> 01:49:40.043]  But it's more on the libertarian side of the political aisle.
[01:49:40.403 --> 01:49:55.966]  So I think the fact that Peter Thiel is willing to go public with that in a high-profile way reveals the degree to which he believes Google is enabling the Chai comms and enabling China at the expense of the United States of America to pursue certain national security interests.
[01:49:56.226 --> 01:50:05.648]  I mean, we're seeing right now what China's attitude is towards freedom and liberty and democracy, that it hasn't changed at all by what's taking place in Hong Kong.
[01:50:06.168 --> 01:50:11.815]  So the for people who don't know, I mean, Hong Kong was not traditionally part of China for a long time.
[01:50:12.576 --> 01:50:15.440]  In fact, it was a UK protectorate up until about 1999.
[01:50:17.002 --> 01:50:24.271]  And then with the agreement to turn it back over to China, China agreed to recognize Hong Kong independence and Hong Kong autonomy.
[01:50:24.671 --> 01:50:31.573]  I've been to Hong Kong several times, and the locals in Hong Kong do not consider themselves part of the mainland Chinese culture or government.
[01:50:31.913 --> 01:50:33.514]  They consider themselves independent.
[01:50:33.854 --> 01:50:35.995]  And yet, right now, they're being beaten up in the streets.
[01:50:36.475 --> 01:50:43.817]  One of the things that Infowars talked about before almost anyone else that's now been confirmed is that, in fact, they were infiltrating the protests.
[01:50:43.857 --> 01:50:52.260]  There were Chinese police officers going undercover, trying to infiltrate the protests, trying to direct the protests, who were exposed by the Hong Kong protesters themselves.
[01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:58.181]  So, in fact, that's now public news, but InfoWars is one of the first places to print and produce that.
[01:50:59.101 --> 01:51:01.282]  And it goes against what Google's goal is.
[01:51:01.402 --> 01:51:03.622]  Google's goal is an authoritarian system.
[01:51:04.223 --> 01:51:16.385]  An authoritarian system that puts Google in control over what information you see, what news you have, ideally what views you choose to employ by shaping what information you see.
[01:51:16.765 --> 01:51:19.826]  So, for example, Professor Robert Epstein
[01:51:20.545 --> 01:51:21.205]  Who's on the left.
[01:51:21.646 --> 01:51:32.150]  Lefty professor has come out repeatedly and he's been following the antitrust investigation in particular because he believes it has major consequential capability to reshape the big tech industry.
[01:51:32.991 --> 01:51:42.275]  The President Trump's actions against big tech in the Google space in particular present a unique opportunity to finally bring big tech to heel, to finally tame big tech.
[01:51:42.822 --> 01:51:58.888]  Because Big Tech has bought off a lot of even so-called conservative think tanks and foundations, has spent lots of money on even conservative politicians, so they've been able to muck up the works and gum up the works when it comes to legislative reform or state-level executive reform.
[01:51:59.348 --> 01:52:07.311]  But even there, they're starting to see action and movement, as Attorney General Barr met with a bunch of state attorney generals who said they're going to take action.
[01:52:07.771 --> 01:52:15.139]  So you see that what Robert Epstein is talking about is that in 2016, President Trump won the popular vote legitimately.
[01:52:15.754 --> 01:52:21.219]  The only reason it didn't show up in the vote tallies was because of Google's meddling in the elections.
[01:52:21.699 --> 01:52:38.674]  According to Professor Epstein, who was a Hillary Clinton supporter, he said he had no doubts whatsoever that there had been at least 5 million or so votes, or if not more, taken from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton solely by the manipulation of Google's algorithms in the political space.
[01:52:39.034 --> 01:52:41.416]  And that's a small-scale version of what Google can do.
[01:52:41.776 --> 01:52:42.996]  Google can do far more.
[01:52:43.096 --> 01:52:44.376]  Yeah, I completely believe it.
[01:52:44.456 --> 01:52:58.399]  So let me ask you this, if President Trump doesn't get the whole socialist, communist, tech giants under the, you know, to do the right thing here, does he stand a chance to lose in 2020?
[01:52:58.459 --> 01:53:10.181]  Because a lot of people say, a lot of people, I've had people send me messages and say, you know what, it doesn't matter what Google does, it doesn't matter what Facebook does, or Twitter and the rest of them, it doesn't matter because we're still going to vote for him.
[01:53:11.167 --> 01:53:18.613]  If President Trump does not get this under control, and personally, I think he needs to get under control immediately.
[01:53:18.993 --> 01:53:20.274]  It's already gone too far.
[01:53:21.195 --> 01:53:27.840]  But based on your opinion, do you think if he doesn't get it under control, is he going to win or lose come 2020?
[01:53:29.651 --> 01:53:33.852]  In my view, his only risk is big tech manipulation of the election.
[01:53:34.353 --> 01:53:41.095]  So if you look at the betting odds and the political odds markets, President Trump is currently considered a 50% chance of winning re-election.
[01:53:41.575 --> 01:53:46.517]  I would say that's much higher under normal circumstances when the party in power is united.
[01:53:47.177 --> 01:53:50.918]  The party in power incumbent wins every single time.
[01:53:51.474 --> 01:53:57.097]  No incumbent has ever lost when he wasn't meaningfully contested within his own party because of party division.
[01:53:57.617 --> 01:54:01.999]  So by that standard, Trump should be a 95% favorite, or better.
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:08.503]  But instead, the betting markets are treating him as a 50% favorite, in part because they're undervaluing and underpricing Trump.
[01:54:08.983 --> 01:54:12.647]  But also because they see and recognize the threat that Big Tech presents.
[01:54:13.088 --> 01:54:22.138]  Professor Epstein has gone into detail with study after study after study that shows Google by itself can move up to 20 million voters in the U.S.
[01:54:22.179 --> 01:54:22.979]  election process.
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:28.386]  And Trump won the Electoral College by about 100,000 aggregate votes across three states.
[01:54:28.979 --> 01:54:37.529]  So all they need to do is target it, and it appears they did do so in 2017, explaining some of the anomalies in the 2017 Alabama Senate election.
[01:54:38.129 --> 01:54:42.514]  It appears they did so again in 2018, because it explains anomalies in the House.
[01:54:42.935 --> 01:54:49.322]  It's not clear the Democrats would have won the House without big tech favoring them and manipulating and meddling in the elections in a wide range of ways.
[01:54:50.109 --> 01:54:54.151]  And so they can do things like they send certain people a message to go out and vote, but not other people.
[01:54:54.571 --> 01:54:57.232]  They tell you they show certain stories, but not other stories.
[01:54:57.512 --> 01:55:05.455]  They let something like Trump body count trend, which is a tagline that makes no sense, but Clinton body count disappear and vanish.
[01:55:05.915 --> 01:55:09.616]  So that's the power that they have to manipulate the mind.
[01:55:10.096 --> 01:55:11.117]  And it becomes more and more.
[01:55:11.537 --> 01:55:12.877]  So just let me jump in.
[01:55:12.937 --> 01:55:16.999]  So just to make clear, because a lot of people, so what happens is that
[01:55:17.839 --> 01:55:29.412]  Google and these socialist tech companies will allow anti-Trump rhetoric to come to the surface to give the impression that the entire country doesn't want President Trump.
[01:55:30.213 --> 01:55:36.099]  And because they're influencing people's thoughts, so when they go to vote
[01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:39.681]  That's what they remember in a subconscious mind.
[01:55:39.741 --> 01:55:43.741]  They remember, oh yeah, Trump is a white supremacist.
[01:55:44.202 --> 01:55:46.062]  Trump hates colored people.
[01:55:46.402 --> 01:55:49.703]  Trump doesn't want people to come here to the country.
[01:55:49.783 --> 01:55:50.843]  He hates immigrants.
[01:55:51.263 --> 01:55:58.104]  When none of that is true, so they allow all of that anti-American, anti-Trump rhetoric to come to the surface.
[01:55:58.385 --> 01:55:59.545]  And that's how they influence.
[01:55:59.925 --> 01:56:01.585]  A lot of people don't understand that.
[01:56:01.925 --> 01:56:04.826]  And you know, just to go to it, I remember when I was younger,
[01:56:05.799 --> 01:56:07.500]  And I would go watch a Kung Fu movie.
[01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:12.182]  And after the Kung Fu movie, I would come outside and I thought, I'm like doing Kung Fu.
[01:56:12.742 --> 01:56:16.624]  Because as a kid, as sublimity, I thought, you know, it's like, yeah, I can do that.
[01:56:16.684 --> 01:56:19.766]  You know, I just saw the action hero fighting, boom, boom, boom.
[01:56:20.726 --> 01:56:22.347]  It still goes on as adults.
[01:56:22.747 --> 01:56:27.530]  Just because we're not going out acting like Kung Fu masters or anything, but in our back of our mind,
[01:56:28.766 --> 01:56:34.057]  People that are easily manipulated, they take that information to the poll and they know that.
[01:56:34.598 --> 01:56:36.602]  And that's how they're manipulating people on a mass scale.
[01:56:36.622 --> 01:56:37.664]  Would you agree or disagree?
[01:56:38.482 --> 01:56:39.463]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:56:39.503 --> 01:56:40.584]  They shape conversation.
[01:56:40.644 --> 01:56:41.384]  They shape thoughts.
[01:56:41.444 --> 01:56:42.325]  They shape ideas.
[01:56:42.385 --> 01:56:44.426]  They shape where you focus your attention.
[01:56:44.747 --> 01:56:56.756]  So, for example, it's not a coincidence that InfoWars has been the primary target of big tech censorship, because InfoWars is able to break through that thought control process that big tech engages in.
[01:56:57.136 --> 01:57:07.684]  So, for example, Alex Jones at InfoWars was the first to broadcast that Joe Biden had clearly serious cognition and health-related issues, showed signs of having a stroke.
[01:57:08.244 --> 01:57:12.346]  All of his S's now are always slurred or have some sort of problem with them.
[01:57:12.486 --> 01:57:13.046]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:57:13.086 --> 01:57:15.767]  Let me break in because we're getting ready to come to a hard break.
[01:57:16.047 --> 01:57:17.428]  Can you stay on longer with me?
[01:57:17.668 --> 01:57:19.488]  Because I love your insight.
[01:57:19.508 --> 01:57:22.790]  So I'm going to get more of that on it after this break.
[01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:25.731]  So we have a, I think this is a short break and we'll come back.
[01:57:26.611 --> 01:57:28.472]  This is Infowars.com.
[01:57:28.512 --> 01:57:31.893]  Don't forget, go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:57:32.273 --> 01:57:36.415]  You can see David Knight, Alex Jones Show, and of course the War Room.
[01:57:37.597 --> 01:57:41.738]  Infowarsstore.com where you can get all the greatest products.
[01:57:42.138 --> 01:57:46.240]  The products that help fight against tyranny and is good for your body.
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:47.260]  It is good.
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:47.800]  I love it.
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:48.160]  I love it.
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:49.441]  We'll be back after this.
[01:57:52.201 --> 01:57:53.522]  Thomas, this is important.
[01:57:54.862 --> 01:57:56.023]  I'm 45 years old.
[01:57:57.163 --> 01:58:03.165]  When I was 35, I swam to two miles a day sometimes and would jog and couldn't lose weight.
[01:58:04.059 --> 01:58:06.621]  Because I didn't have the missing links.
[01:58:06.821 --> 01:58:11.425]  I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[01:58:12.065 --> 01:58:17.249]  I knew all about the Private Federal Reserve, the Trilateral Commission, the New World Order, Jeffrey Epstein, and the pedophile rings.
[01:58:17.569 --> 01:58:22.513]  I knew all about geopolitical systems, and the old Soviet Union, and how the globals put the Psycoms in.
[01:58:22.693 --> 01:58:24.434]  But I didn't know about PQQ.
[01:58:25.135 --> 01:58:26.456]  I didn't know about CoQ10.
[01:58:27.597 --> 01:58:28.978]  I didn't know about all this.
[01:58:29.758 --> 01:58:31.420]  And I didn't know about clean iodine.
[01:58:32.518 --> 01:58:34.079]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation.
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:43.446]  I want you to get products that have changed my life, and changed so many other people's lives, that have 98% reviews, and then experience that I'm not BSing you.
[01:58:44.247 --> 01:58:50.331]  So that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated.
[01:58:50.351 --> 01:58:51.852]  Let me tell you something right now.
[01:58:53.173 --> 01:58:53.974]  You see DNA Force?
[01:58:55.089 --> 01:58:56.670]  I went out to top manufacturers.
[01:58:56.710 --> 01:58:58.511]  They're the most respected, most highly tested.
[01:58:59.292 --> 01:59:08.378]  And I said, I want the strongest PQQ CoQ10 overall formula that has pure, non-synthetic stuff in it that's ever been put on the market.
[01:59:09.339 --> 01:59:11.820]  And they said, well, that's like a $22 each bottle.
[01:59:12.341 --> 01:59:14.022]  I said, I want to put $50 a bottle in it.
[01:59:15.062 --> 01:59:16.723]  They said, nobody's ever done that.
[01:59:16.764 --> 01:59:19.445]  Then I signed a contract to double the amount I was going to buy.
[01:59:19.705 --> 01:59:23.008]  I got it down to $30-something a bottle for what it cost me to make this.
[01:59:23.648 --> 01:59:24.629]  Nobody does that!
[01:59:25.529 --> 01:59:31.815]  Ladies and gentlemen, you read what's in this, and you research every ingredient in this, and then you experience it for yourself.
[01:59:32.676 --> 01:59:33.396]  It's incredible.
[01:59:35.318 --> 01:59:46.208]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Schroeder.
[01:59:46.688 --> 01:59:48.810]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:59:56.892 --> 02:00:00.818]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:23.422 --> 02:00:24.683]  Alright, welcome back!
[02:00:25.543 --> 02:00:29.305]  My name's Will Johnson, this is InfoWars.com.
[02:00:29.805 --> 02:00:33.828]  We're going to play a video for you here, and we're going to put it up here on the screen.
[02:00:35.655 --> 02:00:46.024]  I've been talking about white supremacy in the nation and how they're trying to demonize President Trump and make it look like that he is the white supremacist and he's supporting all this white supremacy.
[02:00:46.565 --> 02:00:47.766]  Which is a total lie!
[02:00:48.346 --> 02:00:59.496]  Everyone knows that President Trump is not racist but for some reason they take this information in and they tell the lie over and over and over and over and over and over and over again until people start believing it.
[02:01:00.137 --> 02:01:00.938]  Yes, yes, yes.
[02:01:01.239 --> 02:01:06.286]  You even have people going out just blatantly saying President Trump is a racist.
[02:01:06.747 --> 02:01:08.971]  So we have a video that we're going to play for you.
[02:01:09.852 --> 02:01:11.054]  Can we put that up on the screen?
[02:01:11.074 --> 02:01:13.958]  Okay, so let's go ahead and play this video.
[02:01:14.359 --> 02:01:14.840]  Check this out.
[02:01:15.535 --> 02:01:18.537]  I'm Ethan Kai with Campus Reform, and today we're at George Washington University.
[02:01:19.258 --> 02:01:21.059]  That is a white man.
[02:01:21.599 --> 02:01:25.342]  Will students sign a fake petition to change it in the name of diversity and inclusion?
[02:01:25.642 --> 02:01:26.122]  Let's find out.
[02:01:26.562 --> 02:01:28.104]  Would you be willing to sign a petition for me?
[02:01:28.644 --> 02:01:31.286]  The crosswalk signs, we're trying to petition to have them changed.
[02:01:31.466 --> 02:01:34.588]  Some students on campus have been offended by them because it's just a picture of a white man.
[02:01:34.848 --> 02:01:39.391]  We're proposing that we could change them to be more representative of an inclusive environment.
[02:01:39.451 --> 02:01:40.652]  That's so cute!
[02:01:40.732 --> 02:01:41.673]  Oh my god, yeah!
[02:01:42.648 --> 02:01:43.669]  Wait, that's awesome!
[02:01:43.809 --> 02:01:45.290]  Is this something you've thought about before?
[02:01:45.570 --> 02:01:51.355]  No, like, I never thought about it, but I can see, like, I guess, like, why some students have a problem with it.
[02:01:51.395 --> 02:01:52.256]  Okay, yeah, that's cool.
[02:01:52.276 --> 02:01:53.217]  I'll totally sign up.
[02:01:53.257 --> 02:01:56.940]  We proposed, like, these other things, so it could be more... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:01:56.980 --> 02:01:58.821]  We just didn't want to offend anyone, you know?
[02:01:59.062 --> 02:02:00.082]  Yeah, no, that's cool.
[02:02:00.102 --> 02:02:01.444]  So is this something you guys can get on board with?
[02:02:01.464 --> 02:02:02.464]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:02:02.625 --> 02:02:03.465]  You guys sign for me?
[02:02:03.505 --> 02:02:03.705]  Yeah.
[02:02:04.726 --> 02:02:11.232]  You know, I assume it's, like, one of many ways in which the default is imagined to be a white man.
[02:02:12.452 --> 02:02:22.618]  See, this just goes to show how easily people are manipulated to believe a certain narrative, to believe that white supremacists is on the rise and they gotta change everything in our culture.
[02:02:22.999 --> 02:02:25.280]  They have to change everything that we see and believe.
[02:02:25.740 --> 02:02:26.181]  Continue.
[02:02:26.841 --> 02:02:29.082]  I totally get that it would be important to other people.
[02:02:29.122 --> 02:02:31.884]  But we're trying to be, you know, yeah, we're trying to be pioneers.
[02:02:32.144 --> 02:02:33.005]  That's a good idea.
[02:02:33.025 --> 02:02:34.366]  Thank you so much.
[02:02:34.666 --> 02:02:36.287]  I haven't really thought of it as a white guy.
[02:02:36.367 --> 02:02:38.068]  I've just thought of it as the lightest white.
[02:02:39.119 --> 02:02:44.843]  I mean, now that I've thought about it, I haven't ever thought about it, but it's just one of those things that... It's definitely a lack of representation.
[02:02:44.863 --> 02:02:45.524]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:02:45.564 --> 02:02:47.465]  Is this something you've thought about before?
[02:02:48.466 --> 02:02:49.887]  Uh... yeah.
[02:02:50.487 --> 02:02:51.368]  I think it's a good idea.
[02:02:51.388 --> 02:02:55.251]  The only problem is, if you're doing such a variety, there might be just a lot of money involved.
[02:02:55.411 --> 02:02:58.493]  How do you think, like, students who, like, are offended by this would feel?
[02:02:59.114 --> 02:03:00.515]  Probably more validated.
[02:03:00.795 --> 02:03:01.135]  Yeah.
[02:03:01.175 --> 02:03:03.517]  Like, of course I'll stop, and this is super cool.
[02:03:04.912 --> 02:03:06.795]  It's kind of simple, you know?
[02:03:06.815 --> 02:03:11.802]  Just a guy walking across the street, but... If it can help other people out, then why not, right?
[02:03:11.862 --> 02:03:16.850]  Look at this.
[02:03:17.090 --> 02:03:20.375]  So, I think there's gonna put a picture up here where they're gonna show the different ones.
[02:03:22.421 --> 02:03:23.862]  Um, can we get that picture?
[02:03:24.462 --> 02:03:35.108]  So basically the gist of this is to get people to sign this petition to say that we need to change the street sign to all these different, different colors and different characters.
[02:03:35.168 --> 02:03:37.949]  So now if you're looking on the screen, you have one here.
[02:03:37.969 --> 02:03:40.051]  I guess this is a pregnant man.
[02:03:40.911 --> 02:03:41.591]  For a crossing.
[02:03:42.212 --> 02:03:45.274]  And then you have, what is this, uh, trans maybe?
[02:03:45.894 --> 02:03:49.116]  Um, or just, uh, and then the LGBTQP.
[02:03:50.076 --> 02:03:58.221]  And I guess this is, I guess maybe this is the only one they consider to be, uh, white supremacist, because it's just a white lady, I guess, I'm assuming.
[02:03:58.961 --> 02:04:00.942]  And, uh, don't forget we have our brown people.
[02:04:01.703 --> 02:04:03.864]  And then, of course, you know, disabled people.
[02:04:03.944 --> 02:04:07.006]  So, they're gonna change all of this
[02:04:08.151 --> 02:04:30.852]  to to just because of someone's feelings and because they make up one every single day they make up a new gender every single day they probably need to put 20 or so what is it 78 78 of these signs in one location and people are going to look okay is mine listed up there do I get to go across the street now
[02:04:31.812 --> 02:04:33.053]  This is what we're coming to.
[02:04:33.093 --> 02:04:38.535]  This is a society that we're coming to, and it was really crazy that you have people that's actually signing this petition.
[02:04:39.136 --> 02:04:46.319]  They're believing that they have to do this to get people to understand the craziness, and they're doing it.
[02:04:46.619 --> 02:04:48.140]  They're being very successful with it.
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:50.001]  All right, my name is Will Johnson.
[02:04:50.261 --> 02:04:54.163]  This is Infowars.com, and we'll be back after this.

[02:06:20.907 --> 02:06:24.108]  And now, your host, Will Johnson.
[02:06:25.609 --> 02:06:29.310]  All right.
[02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:33.671]  You know, the production crews there are awesome.
[02:06:34.619 --> 02:06:35.239]  They're awesome.
[02:06:35.299 --> 02:06:36.860]  I love the tunes they bring in.
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:38.641]  They're so awesome.
[02:06:40.002 --> 02:06:42.003]  I mean, how does it function without them?
[02:06:42.223 --> 02:06:42.583]  It doesn't.
[02:06:43.763 --> 02:06:46.925]  All right, we're back and we have Mr. Barnes with us still.
[02:06:46.945 --> 02:06:48.586]  It's a great honor and pleasure.
[02:06:48.606 --> 02:06:51.207]  Mr. Barnes, let me ask you this.
[02:06:51.227 --> 02:06:55.149]  You know, do you think Google
[02:06:58.234 --> 02:07:03.861]  We'll say enough is enough and, you know, kind of maybe loosen up a little bit.
[02:07:04.722 --> 02:07:08.406]  And before we went to the break, I was asking you about
[02:07:10.253 --> 02:07:15.197]  Conservatives versus liberals, which one, you know, are liberals happy?
[02:07:15.257 --> 02:07:16.799]  Which ones attack more?
[02:07:16.819 --> 02:07:19.941]  Because there's some liberals that say that, you know, Google has censored them.
[02:07:20.542 --> 02:07:27.548]  And the only time I've ever seen that is when they said that they started, you know, OK, well, I agree with President Trump here.
[02:07:27.568 --> 02:07:28.529]  I agree with him there.
[02:07:28.829 --> 02:07:31.672]  And then all of a sudden, they start getting this censorship.
[02:07:31.712 --> 02:07:33.893]  I think, is it Tim Pool?
[02:07:34.622 --> 02:07:35.122]  Is that his name?
[02:07:35.162 --> 02:07:35.602]  Tim Pool?
[02:07:36.263 --> 02:07:38.364]  He, you know, because he says he was a liberal.
[02:07:39.224 --> 02:07:40.945]  I think he still claims that he's a liberal.
[02:07:41.485 --> 02:07:45.027]  But he came out and he said, you know, I was watching him on Joe Rogan and he said, I'm a liberal.
[02:07:45.047 --> 02:07:45.547]  And I'm like, what?
[02:07:45.567 --> 02:07:47.148]  But I love everything he was saying.
[02:07:47.568 --> 02:07:52.531]  And he said, he said, but what Google is doing, what Twitter is doing, he said, I'm terrified.
[02:07:53.251 --> 02:08:08.842]  There's someone right there that is absolutely thinking for himself, and then I think he started experiencing the censorship as well, because I've seen some of his YouTube videos, and I actually come to think about it, he used to show up on my feed all the time, but now he doesn't even show up any longer.
[02:08:08.863 --> 02:08:11.124]  You know, I have to go look for him.
[02:08:11.144 --> 02:08:13.366]  It's just, it's really crazy.
[02:08:14.421 --> 02:08:15.182]  I mean, it's extraordinary.
[02:08:15.222 --> 02:08:17.625]  So, it has happened to people on the left.
[02:08:18.406 --> 02:08:23.693]  Particularly people on the anti-war left, on the anti-establishment left, and the anti-big tech left.
[02:08:24.204 --> 02:08:36.111]  So one of the things that's happening, for which Alex Jones is always the best template, so that when you do the comparison between the Google search and the Bing or DuckDuckGo search for Alex Jones, you get multiple levels of information.
[02:08:36.432 --> 02:08:41.515]  The first level of information is that clearly Google is manipulating its algorithm to create a false result.
[02:08:41.575 --> 02:08:46.358]  Because most people, when they search Google, they think they're getting what other people have searched for.
[02:08:46.838 --> 02:08:54.744]  That's their trust and confidence in the Google algorithm, is that it will honestly and accurately reflect broader public interest and opinion.
[02:08:55.264 --> 02:08:57.005]  Not that it's being manipulated or meddled.
[02:08:57.105 --> 02:09:04.971]  Google doesn't put on the front page, by the way, the search results will be based on what Google thinks you should see, not based on what the world actually is interested in seeing.
[02:09:06.212 --> 02:09:12.556]  But you go further and deeper into it, and you'll see exactly how they're doing the manipulation and what they're doing in the manipulation.
[02:09:13.016 --> 02:09:24.682]  So, for example, clearly they're discriminating and have changed the manipulation so that Alex Jones only triggers certain kind of information, and they filter out any positive information and filter in any negative information.
[02:09:25.122 --> 02:09:29.965]  But part of the way they're doing that is by elevating certain publications as gatekeepers over others.
[02:09:30.705 --> 02:09:32.066]  Facebook is doing this big time.
[02:09:32.586 --> 02:09:42.391]  And so what happens is anybody who's sort of on an anti-establishment press, anti-war press, things of that nature, they're also getting screened out of the gatekeeper role.
[02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:50.530]  So like Mitt Press, Caitlin Johnstone, certain anti-war publications, Counterpunch.
[02:09:50.930 --> 02:10:01.584]  These are publications that may be culturally to the left, but on certain issues of war and establishment and elite power are actually more on the Trumpist side of the equation, the Alex Jones side of the equation.
[02:10:02.057 --> 02:10:09.059]  So, for example, in certain contexts, when you do certain searches, you won't find certain left-leaning sources.
[02:10:09.259 --> 02:10:14.500]  The best example of this most recently was their open and overt discrimination against Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:10:14.961 --> 02:10:23.443]  So Tulsi Gabbard has a lot of left-wing views on a wide range of issues, but not on war and not on certain establishment politics involving the deep state.
[02:10:23.943 --> 02:10:29.506]  And so what happened is, the first debate, people are like, wow, this is a totally interesting, unique person.
[02:10:29.946 --> 02:10:39.431]  And so she was trying to appeal to the anti-war part of the Democratic base, which used to be much bigger, but the political establishment within the Democratic Party is now very pro-war, pro-deep state.
[02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:58.167]  And so Google, what they did is they right away turned off the spigot so that like her advertising was driven based on if there was suddenly a big surge in popular support, she would be able to tap into that for donations, tap into that for support by having her campaign ads run at the top of when you look.
[02:10:58.727 --> 02:11:05.850]  But what happened is Google turned it off at exactly the moment there was a sudden surge of interest in her during the debate.
[02:11:05.890 --> 02:11:08.771]  That's why she sued them for $50 million.
[02:11:09.291 --> 02:11:11.072]  Because that's how much they cost her.
[02:11:11.992 --> 02:11:21.516]  They might have done fatal damage, but for the fact that she was able to replicate her performance in the second debate, and most importantly, she brought suit before that second debate.
[02:11:21.836 --> 02:11:26.978]  So all of a sudden, Google realized they were being exposed, and they're like, well, we don't want to be obvious what we're doing.
[02:11:27.258 --> 02:11:36.442]  So after the second debate, which he surged again, in fact, Owen and I were doing the pre-debate activities, and we were predicting certain things, and almost every prediction came true.
[02:11:36.762 --> 02:11:37.862]  Who was going to win the George poll?
[02:11:38.062 --> 02:11:39.383]  Who was going to win the Google search?
[02:11:39.603 --> 02:11:41.424]  Who was going to go up in the political betting markets?
[02:11:41.644 --> 02:11:43.905]  Who was going to go up in the Democratic political opinion polls?
[02:11:44.325 --> 02:11:49.347]  All of it, and one of the big ones was that Tulsi Gabbard would do well on all four fronts, and she in fact did.
[02:11:49.927 --> 02:12:06.480]  So, in fact, the people who are watching InfoWars and had a little bet, there's the UK fans and other fans, there's online various methods, had any sort of bet on the predicted and the rest, had bets on following what we were recommending and advising, they made between a 35% and 50% profit overnight.
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:11.563]  So, you don't just have to go to the InfoWarsStore.com in order to get great deals.
[02:12:11.724 --> 02:12:14.786]  And those InfoWars stocks, not only are you supporting the freedom,
[02:12:15.186 --> 02:12:20.273]  And supporting the revolution, and you're supporting the revolution of information, and you're supporting the democratization of the press.
[02:12:20.313 --> 02:12:26.181]  You're reinstating the original organic principles and purposes of the spirit of the press.
[02:12:27.854 --> 02:12:34.698]  Free speech, support free elections, support free religion, but at the same time, you're getting above average products at below average prices.
[02:12:35.018 --> 02:12:39.741]  I mean, you're not putting more money in InfoWars' pocket, you're putting more money into your own pocket.
[02:12:40.001 --> 02:12:53.949]  And the way you do so is by getting products you need, by bidding products you like, by getting products you want, but at cheaper prices and better value than the competition because of the way InfoWars is structured and being a direct merchandiser.
[02:12:56.044 --> 02:13:03.468]  So there's multiple ways to make the Infowars experience more than just a learning experience, but make it a self-profiting experience.
[02:13:03.488 --> 02:13:04.368]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:07.210]  Let me ask you this.
[02:13:07.450 --> 02:13:09.251]  Who do you think Google is rooting for?
[02:13:09.471 --> 02:13:22.058]  Because for them to do Tafsa Gilbert that way, because she was trending on Twitter, she was trending everywhere, and that would have been a prime time for her to run ads, to run advertisements, you know, getting donations like you said.
[02:13:23.123 --> 02:13:26.584]  Because they did that to her and she's running on the Democrat ticket.
[02:13:26.704 --> 02:13:30.185]  Who do you think that they want to be on top of the ticket?
[02:13:30.305 --> 02:13:34.286]  I don't imagine that it's Joe Biden because he's an old white man.
[02:13:34.786 --> 02:13:36.106]  They don't want white people.
[02:13:36.186 --> 02:13:37.467]  They hate white people.
[02:13:37.747 --> 02:13:38.507]  Let them tell it.
[02:13:38.807 --> 02:13:40.527]  So who is it do you think that they want?
[02:13:42.028 --> 02:13:46.809]  They are satisfied with any of the Democratic nominees except Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:13:47.316 --> 02:13:49.597]  So all the others are just fine.
[02:13:49.998 --> 02:13:57.562]  All the others serve and suit their purposes across the board in terms of, in their perception, having a chance to beat Donald Trump.
[02:13:58.383 --> 02:14:05.006]  Also, and even though people like Elizabeth Warren is talking about breaking up big tech, they really don't take her seriously in that capacity.
[02:14:05.387 --> 02:14:07.288]  Warren is someone who talks a lot, does little.
[02:14:08.308 --> 02:14:21.857]  And so the, so Gabbard is the only one that really scares them because she raises issues and topics that challenge the deep state's establishment power related to the military-industrial complex and permanent war, and in fact buttresses Trump.
[02:14:21.877 --> 02:14:26.259]  It's not a coincidence, like the deep state in particular, and that's the important thing about Google.
[02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:28.981]  Google's in bed with China and deep state operators.
[02:14:29.361 --> 02:14:40.606]  So it's not so much that they're partisan, it's that they see particular threats to deep state right now from the right, from the independent right, from the Alex Jones part of the right, and from the Tulsi Gabbard part of the left.
[02:14:40.986 --> 02:14:42.706]  So that's who they're going to suppress and censor.
[02:14:42.987 --> 02:14:51.390]  So it has a partisan coloration currently, but not necessarily, because it's about whatever advances deep state politics, deep state policies,
[02:14:52.250 --> 02:14:56.372]  And the rising power of China, who Google has gotten to bed with.
[02:14:56.693 --> 02:14:58.534]  So that's sort of their overarching theme.
[02:14:58.554 --> 02:15:03.616]  And that's where you can see Tim Poole, I think, has a big YouTube network.
[02:15:03.856 --> 02:15:07.358]  They're trying to suppress and censor him as much as Steven Crowder.
[02:15:07.758 --> 02:15:12.821]  And it's because both of them have anti-establishment populist politics and policies on a wide range of topics.
[02:15:13.221 --> 02:15:18.724]  Even though they are on different sides of the ideological spectrum in general, and different sides of the partisan spectrum in general.
[02:15:18.944 --> 02:15:20.304]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.
[02:15:20.705 --> 02:15:23.726]  So, we're getting ready to come up to a hard break, but yeah, you're absolutely right.
[02:15:24.046 --> 02:15:34.711]  You know, the reason why I stopped getting Tim Poole's feed, or his videos popping up on my YouTube channel, I just went and looked at it, they unsubscribed me!
[02:15:35.967 --> 02:15:37.548]  They unsubscribed me from Tim Pool.
[02:15:38.368 --> 02:15:39.968]  I mean, I just literally look at it.
[02:15:40.008 --> 02:15:41.549]  They unsubscribed me from Tim Pool.
[02:15:41.589 --> 02:15:42.809]  So how many other people?
[02:15:43.129 --> 02:15:44.830]  And they've done me that way with Mark Dice.
[02:15:44.890 --> 02:15:47.211]  I had to go back in and subscribe to Mark Dice.
[02:15:47.831 --> 02:15:49.912]  They constantly do it because they don't want us seeing it.
[02:15:49.932 --> 02:15:52.752]  And now I'm getting all this stuff from China to show up on my feed.
[02:15:53.053 --> 02:15:54.333]  What in the world is that about?
[02:15:55.193 --> 02:15:56.734]  I can't even, I can't even read it.
[02:15:57.994 --> 02:15:59.075]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:59.175 --> 02:16:00.055]  We'll be back after this.
[02:16:02.622 --> 02:16:05.404]  President Trump was sworn in in January of 2017.
[02:16:05.464 --> 02:16:12.669]  The average farm journal and poll had him at about 50% with farmers.
[02:16:13.349 --> 02:16:27.999]  Fast forward to August 2019, two and a half years later, and he's at 79% in the farm journal survey, which is the most respected, and other farm journals show him as high as 90%.
[02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:35.743]  No president since these journals have existed has had numbers this high.
[02:16:36.264 --> 02:16:38.025]  Now why am I so excited about that?
[02:16:38.125 --> 02:16:39.205]  Why am I so proud of that?
[02:16:41.967 --> 02:16:43.788]  Farmers got assaulted by the Democrats.
[02:16:45.207 --> 02:16:51.811]  Trump came in and was reasonable about it and said, hey, foreign countries have internal tariffs.
[02:16:51.951 --> 02:16:52.732]  I'll get rid of those.
[02:16:53.212 --> 02:16:57.274]  We don't need all these subsidies, but we'll actually let you compete directly into those markets.
[02:16:58.095 --> 02:17:02.277]  And when China put massive tariffs on U.S.
[02:17:02.317 --> 02:17:05.559]  farmers, their support for Trump only went up.
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:11.183]  And then, when China banned a week ago all U.S.
[02:17:11.203 --> 02:17:11.583]  produce
[02:17:13.803 --> 02:17:14.683]  Trump's numbers went up.
[02:17:15.464 --> 02:17:19.345]  Now, I talk about this all the time, but this is the key to everything.
[02:17:20.186 --> 02:17:31.250]  When Americans and free people know they're being dominated and assaulted and bullied, and they know that it's artificial and that it's from outside, they will rally and come together every time.
[02:17:32.591 --> 02:17:36.473]  You know, I harp on this constantly, that these globalists, the Democrats, are bullies.
[02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:53.918]  And they think that if they attack us, and lie about us, and call us Nazis, and physically come after us, and dox our homes, and tell us the American flag sucks, and that America's bad, that somehow we'll become demoralized, and kneel to them, bow to them.
[02:17:55.339 --> 02:17:56.120]  That's not what's happening.
[02:17:57.201 --> 02:18:00.645]  Americans were asleep before, because they thought everything was fine.
[02:18:01.894 --> 02:18:04.075]  Now Americans know that the country's in peril.
[02:18:04.435 --> 02:18:06.417]  And they know that Trump at Infowars is fighting.
[02:18:07.417 --> 02:18:09.318]  And so now they're ready for a war.
[02:18:09.878 --> 02:18:10.899]  They're ready for a battle.
[02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:18.603]  And so when the Chi-Coms come in and say, we're going to put tariffs on your goods, they say, oh, we support Trump more.
[02:18:20.044 --> 02:18:28.269]  And then when they say, we're banning all your food, we're going to all cost each one of your families a large piece of their paycheck, because China imports a lot of food from us they can't produce.
[02:18:29.286 --> 02:18:30.427]  They said, that's fine, you go ahead and do that.
[02:18:30.928 --> 02:18:33.131]  Because you've been screwing our industry over forever.
[02:18:33.391 --> 02:18:38.196]  And the farmers get what the Rust Belt and the factories and the workers have gone through.
[02:18:38.216 --> 02:18:39.158]  And they're standing up.
[02:18:39.178 --> 02:18:44.904]  Because farmers have a long history in this country of standing up to tyranny because they understand how the system operates.
[02:18:44.924 --> 02:18:47.547]  And Thomas Jefferson said it'll be the yeoman farmers
[02:18:48.248 --> 02:18:58.155]  That will end up being the heart of this country, and when the country's in crisis, it'll be the farmers, who are close to the ground, and close to the earth, and close to reality, who are going to be the ones to save the nation.
[02:18:58.555 --> 02:19:10.964]  So I'm so proud of America's farmers, for a race, color, and creed, who are the heartland of this nation, and who understand that, hey, you try to intimidate me, you try to bully me, because our president stood up for our industry?
[02:19:11.624 --> 02:19:17.729]  We're ready to take it on the chin in this fight because we understand it's for a greater good.
[02:19:18.169 --> 02:19:25.895]  America had surrendered for 50 years to globalism and de-industrialization and 30 years selling our jobs out to China.
[02:19:26.235 --> 02:19:27.957]  And that surrender is open.
[02:19:28.737 --> 02:19:29.718]  But I'll say this to farmers.
[02:19:30.479 --> 02:19:31.419]  You think you're under attack?
[02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:33.201]  Infowars is under attack as well.
[02:19:33.241 --> 02:19:35.783]  And I notice that it's farming families that really support us.
[02:19:35.803 --> 02:19:36.864]  You're our strongest group.
[02:19:36.884 --> 02:19:39.306]  You understand that we're in the same position you're in.
[02:19:39.606 --> 02:19:40.627]  You think you've been sanctioned?
[02:19:41.387 --> 02:19:43.069]  They have unleashed hell on us, but you know what?
[02:19:43.369 --> 02:19:55.699]  We're still here because of you, so please, whether it's coffee, or toothpaste, or fish oil, or turmeric, we got great products at great prices at Infowarslife.com and Infowarsstore.com, and your financial support is what keeps us here as well.
[02:19:56.219 --> 02:19:57.720]  So, the globalists have sanctioned us.
[02:19:58.521 --> 02:20:01.984]  That's okay, because the farmers of America are standing with us, and we stand with you.
[02:20:06.307 --> 02:20:08.949]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:33.284 --> 02:20:33.824]  Welcome back.
[02:20:33.844 --> 02:20:35.726]  Infowars.com.
[02:20:36.407 --> 02:20:41.833]  For our last show, we're talking with Mr. Burns.
[02:20:42.754 --> 02:20:44.435]  Beautiful, awesome information.
[02:20:45.256 --> 02:20:55.526]  Like I said in the beginning, it's amazing that someone's walking around with so much knowledge and so much information, and just on point about everything he's been talking about.
[02:20:56.671 --> 02:21:00.993]  I guess one thing I would like to know is what do the American people do?
[02:21:01.133 --> 02:21:01.873]  What can we do?
[02:21:01.973 --> 02:21:03.474]  I mean, so think about it.
[02:21:04.134 --> 02:21:12.297]  Us as the American citizens, we're the ones that's being affected by the tech companies, and a lot of us, we depend on President Trump to fix it.
[02:21:12.937 --> 02:21:17.239]  And I've had conversation with people in the past, and they said, well, you know, President Trump
[02:21:18.288 --> 02:21:19.469]  He hasn't done anything.
[02:21:20.109 --> 02:21:30.258]  And on the surface, just looking at it, it doesn't look like he's done anything to stop these tech companies, these socialist tech companies, from censoring conservatives.
[02:21:30.678 --> 02:21:35.222]  Because I can put a video on YouTube right now, and they will suppress it.
[02:21:35.262 --> 02:21:36.242]  They demonetize it.
[02:21:36.262 --> 02:21:38.184]  I timed it like a week ago.
[02:21:40.387 --> 02:21:45.688]  I put a video on YouTube, and about 14 minutes later, it was already demonetized.
[02:21:46.249 --> 02:21:53.970]  It didn't have anything, no violence in it, no nudity, no cursing, no bullying.
[02:21:54.791 --> 02:22:07.654]  Zero went against their community standards, except for the community standards that's hidden to the rest of us, which is, if you're pro-American, if you're pro-Trump, then that goes against their community standards.
[02:22:08.479 --> 02:22:10.900]  So, Mr. Barnes, so what can we do?
[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:13.560]  I mean, because not all of us have the funding.
[02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:17.141]  None of us can, you know, just say, you know what, let's go sue Google.
[02:22:17.301 --> 02:22:19.202]  Everyone's saying we should sue them, sue them.
[02:22:19.222 --> 02:22:26.123]  I mean, you can't do that when you're not billionaires or you don't have the money or you don't have the pool, like Tassie Gilbert in this case.
[02:22:27.224 --> 02:22:28.244]  We don't, we can't do it.
[02:22:28.604 --> 02:22:36.126]  Is it possible to get like conservative lawyers throughout the country to possibly come together
[02:22:37.088 --> 02:22:37.849]  And do something.
[02:22:38.329 --> 02:22:44.015]  Because every time President Trump does something to protect the American people, they find a liberal leftist lawyer to stop the President!
[02:22:44.395 --> 02:22:53.965]  So how come we can't get a group, a team of conservative lawyers and not charge everyone out the leg, wazoo, to help us keep our freedoms?
[02:22:54.325 --> 02:22:55.326]  Is that even possible?
[02:22:55.727 --> 02:22:56.788]  Or has that even been brought up?
[02:22:58.161 --> 02:22:59.662]  Oh, actually, Debbie, you mentioned it.
[02:22:59.702 --> 02:23:15.135]  We've created an organization called the Free America Law Center, which people can find at FreeAmericaLawCenter.com, which is basically a membership driven, mass support driven organization to achieve exactly what you're talking about.
[02:23:15.535 --> 02:23:26.965]  I brought together a range of conservative lawyers and legal law firms that are legal support organizations that are willing to work at a discounted rate, willing to work in some cases at a free rate,
[02:23:27.745 --> 02:23:33.930]  In terms of their own legal time, willing to advance costs in certain consequences, certain circumstances.
[02:23:34.470 --> 02:23:45.379]  And the net effect of all of that is a free America law center can help equalize access to the law by democratizing our legal system by having mass support of an organization.
[02:23:45.679 --> 02:23:52.084]  So basically the way it's supported is people are monthly members and the monthly membership amount is $17.76 a month.
[02:23:54.265 --> 02:24:05.975]  And it's set at a low rate so that it's affordable and accessible for the biggest group of people to support it because that will make it self-supporting and self-sustaining in the same way that InfoWars is.
[02:24:06.555 --> 02:24:09.878]  And so, in addition, anybody who's a member gets additional benefits.
[02:24:10.198 --> 02:24:15.402]  They get exclusive Q&A podcasts with legal experts and lawyers across the country.
[02:24:15.762 --> 02:24:17.784]  I've donated a lot of my time to the organization.
[02:24:18.104 --> 02:24:21.387]  I've donated a lot of my capital to the organization to help it take off.
[02:24:21.887 --> 02:24:26.089]  We'll be one of the lead counsel for the organization for the cases we're going to bring against Big Tech.
[02:24:26.770 --> 02:24:40.437]  On top of that, people get free digital books on their Bill of Rights so that they have a it's a digital Bill of Rights book series so that people are self-educated so that they're self-armored because the best mechanism of using your legal remedies is to know your legal remedies.
[02:24:40.857 --> 02:24:43.058]  And so we've created that to have an additional benefit.
[02:24:43.338 --> 02:24:50.582]  So simply for the cost of a book, they get a monthly book that they're getting each month is the sole, the whole cost of the subscription.
[02:24:50.962 --> 02:24:51.784]  But it goes beyond that.
[02:24:51.844 --> 02:24:59.959]  So there's going to be videos, there's going to be exclusive events, there's going to be newsletters that are exclusive to them, there's going to be daily information podcasts exclusive to them.
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:03.606]  So the goal is to let's create an organization that provides real value to people.
[02:25:04.105 --> 02:25:12.847]  Well, at the same time, providing necessary bridge to the legal remedies that exist in the system, but that are currently inaccessible or unaffordable to the mass of the population.
[02:25:13.267 --> 02:25:29.570]  So the goal will be to use Free American Law Center to bring class action suits against Google, class action suits against YouTube, class action suits against Twitter, class action suits against Facebook, and using every novel creative legal theory that's out there to basically to the traditionally the left.
[02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:30.070]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:52.498 --> 02:25:55.021]  I'm glad you brought them up because I was getting ready to talk about them.
[02:25:55.181 --> 02:26:07.156]  I know the Southern Poverty Law Center right now has a lawsuit against a group of people out of Arizona and they call themselves the Arizona Patriots and AZ.
[02:26:07.776 --> 02:26:08.657]  And what it is,
[02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:16.796]  They were going out just doing, you know, journalism, freelancing, reporting on what's taking place.
[02:26:16.816 --> 02:26:23.181]  They actually recorded some illegals getting off the bus and going into a church, and they were recording them.
[02:26:23.241 --> 02:26:28.385]  They had the permission to record them.
[02:26:28.505 --> 02:26:34.890]  It was on a public area, but now the Southern Poverty Law Center is going after them
[02:26:35.891 --> 02:26:37.632]  Because they reported the truth.
[02:26:38.212 --> 02:26:46.217]  So, and that's fearful to a lot of people, because anyone who has a mobile device, a phone, you are a reporter.
[02:26:46.737 --> 02:26:48.258]  You are a freelance reporter.
[02:26:48.758 --> 02:26:51.740]  You go out there and you see something take place, everyone's doing it now.
[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:54.862]  First thing they do, they turn on their camera, record it.
[02:26:55.182 --> 02:26:58.424]  We just had an episode in, what was it, Disney?
[02:26:59.244 --> 02:27:00.985]  What was it, Disney World or Disneyland?
[02:27:01.105 --> 02:27:07.889]  One of them, where a group of people, and they happen to be black, they all act completely stupid, but what did everybody do that was there?
[02:27:08.089 --> 02:27:10.911]  They pulled out their phone camera, they started recording it.
[02:27:11.451 --> 02:27:15.453]  Everyone is a reporter, a freelance reporter, if you have a phone right now.
[02:27:15.953 --> 02:27:22.477]  But how, so how is it that they can be sued, or tried to be sued because they're reporting on the truth?
[02:27:22.797 --> 02:27:25.659]  I mean, what kind of society are we living in?
[02:27:26.838 --> 02:27:29.601]  It's very much selective, weaponized lawfare.
[02:27:30.002 --> 02:27:35.107]  And so, for example, those Arizona Patriots may become clients of the Free America Law Center.
[02:27:35.167 --> 02:27:39.952]  It's one of the clients that they're looking at taking, and part of the organization that's looking at it.
[02:27:40.593 --> 02:27:42.415]  Basically, it'll depend on public support.
[02:27:42.555 --> 02:27:45.358]  The more public support that exists, the more cases it can take on.
[02:27:46.018 --> 02:27:46.719]  We're good to go.
[02:28:04.412 --> 02:28:20.088]  And what it is, is they're using the legal system, not only to interfere with and impair our elected processes by undermining the president with leftist judges, but they're also doing it in the same way by using the legal system and the threat of the legal system to intimidate and terrorize their political and ideological adversaries.
[02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:22.351]  So they can just bankrupt them just by suing them.
[02:28:22.651 --> 02:28:26.615]  Now of course, as always, the template, the tip of the spear for all of this is Alex Jones.
[02:28:26.975 --> 02:28:33.939]  That's why Alex, he's being targeted across the board in the widest range of lawfare in the history of the independent press in this country.
[02:28:34.179 --> 02:28:38.522]  And that's why it's critical and essential that he prevail in the courts of law and public opinion.
[02:28:38.542 --> 02:28:45.365]  You're absolutely right, and it's crucial that everyone, the American people, support InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:28:45.786 --> 02:28:49.628]  You showing your support, saying that you want to keep your freedom, saying that you want
[02:28:50.288 --> 02:28:51.148]  Our sovereignty.
[02:28:51.529 --> 02:28:52.849]  They want to take it all away.
[02:28:52.869 --> 02:28:53.610]  They don't care.
[02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:55.610]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:28:55.911 --> 02:28:58.352]  Go there today to help fight this tyranny.
[02:28:58.652 --> 02:29:07.095]  We'll be back after this.
[02:29:07.456 --> 02:29:13.978]  We're going to move to the east, to the Horn of Africa and Somalia, the most dangerous, backward, evil country in the world.
[02:29:13.998 --> 02:29:16.059]  And you know why Somalia is so bad?
[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:19.521]  Because African countries all around it
[02:29:21.266 --> 02:29:34.896]  have driven the Arab slavers in the last thousand years, the Muslim slavers, into the Horn of Africa, where it was the center of the slave trade of Africans all over the world.
[02:29:35.056 --> 02:29:38.559]  Once the Roman Empire fell, white slaves were the main slave group.
[02:29:38.679 --> 02:29:43.803]  Africans that were rich had white slaves, just because that's who was trained and where they got slaves was Gaul.
[02:29:43.923 --> 02:29:44.984]  That's France today.
[02:29:45.224 --> 02:29:47.846]  Germania, which is Austria and Germany.
[02:29:48.186 --> 02:29:52.948]  The British and others, who they called Gaelic, out of, what's the UK today?
[02:29:53.168 --> 02:29:54.789]  Old Albion, England.
[02:29:55.009 --> 02:30:05.373]  But after the fall of the Roman Empire, the Western Empire, then the fall of the Eastern Empire, Constantinople, when the Islamists took it, civilization collapsed in Western Europe.
[02:30:05.433 --> 02:30:08.174]  And there wasn't any good slaves being brought in anymore.
[02:30:08.334 --> 02:30:11.195]  And so the Muslims started enslaving
[02:30:12.621 --> 02:30:13.381]  Africans.
[02:30:13.902 --> 02:30:15.662]  Over a thousand years ago.
[02:30:15.902 --> 02:30:18.803]  And that's why Ilhan Omar doesn't look African.
[02:30:18.863 --> 02:30:20.904]  She's an elite Somali.
[02:30:21.084 --> 02:30:23.825]  The upper-class Somalis are light-skinned.
[02:30:23.965 --> 02:30:27.386]  They are Muslims and they are slave traffickers.
[02:30:27.666 --> 02:30:31.788]  They sell black slaves today to four countries that still allow slavery.
[02:30:31.948 --> 02:30:35.209]  It's still customary in several Arab countries to have black house slaves.
[02:30:35.429 --> 02:30:36.409]  That's the truth, folks.
[02:30:36.429 --> 02:30:37.530]  They don't want you to know.
[02:30:37.950 --> 02:30:40.111]  I bet you a lot of money she comes from slavers.
[02:30:40.491 --> 02:30:47.693]  And you're literally looking at someone that comes from the hub of a thousand years of black slavery.
[02:30:47.913 --> 02:30:52.214]  Ilhan Omar, guaranteed in her lineage, is pure slaver.
[02:30:52.374 --> 02:30:57.295]  They ship slaves out of Somalia all the way to Indonesia.
[02:30:57.415 --> 02:31:04.497]  And then as you project out towards the east to the far east, you will see all the islands and countries they've taken over.
[02:31:05.097 --> 02:31:09.641]  In the last 1,000 years since Islam, 1,400 years ago, went expansionist.
[02:31:09.802 --> 02:31:15.447]  And again, if you go out into the Pacific Ocean, they're all Muslims, and they test the genetics, and they're African.
[02:31:15.547 --> 02:31:16.348]  Part African.
[02:31:16.508 --> 02:31:16.968]  Why is that?
[02:31:17.048 --> 02:31:22.574]  Because the Muslims loaded slave ships full of black people and shipped them all over the Pacific.
[02:31:22.634 --> 02:31:24.596]  But you don't even get taught that at university.
[02:31:24.756 --> 02:31:28.539]  And then you don't ever hear that the Muslims are currently still all running that.
[02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:30.742]  Slavers of Africa.
[02:31:30.922 --> 02:31:45.720]  The Horn is where people from Ethiopia and people from Kenya were taken up for over a thousand years and walked, bound as slaves to be loaded on ships to ship them all over the world, all the way to the Pacific Ocean.
[02:31:47.181 --> 02:31:48.263]  But the white man did it!
[02:31:49.477 --> 02:31:56.403]  Not the precious Muslim, not the precious Islam, when Muhammad was a slaver in Mecca and Medina, where they sold slaves from all over the world.
[02:31:56.503 --> 02:31:59.966]  But see, I'm a bad man, you see, because I, I know the history.
[02:32:00.166 --> 02:32:01.207]  I gotta be shut up!
[02:32:01.567 --> 02:32:02.448]  I'm a white devil!
[02:32:02.468 --> 02:32:08.453]  Everybody wants to get into my country, because all the medicine, and all the technology, and all the rest of the stuff.
[02:32:08.473 --> 02:32:11.976]  See, I'm the bad guy who doesn't want you to abort your baby, no matter what color you are.
[02:32:12.256 --> 02:32:16.099]  And all through here, if you look where Islam is, you wonder how it got all over the world.
[02:32:16.279 --> 02:32:18.140]  That's because of slave ships.
[02:32:18.521 --> 02:32:26.126]  That's because of boobies, which are Islamic pirates who over a thousand years ago robbed Japanese, Chinese ships, you name it.
[02:32:26.286 --> 02:32:29.909]  The term booby trap comes from traps that pirates would lay.
[02:32:29.929 --> 02:32:30.869]  Boobies.
[02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:33.031]  Boobies aren't things that give you milk.
[02:32:33.531 --> 02:32:34.912]  Boobies are things that kill you.
[02:32:35.333 --> 02:32:37.994]  Boobies are slavers out of Somalia.
[02:32:38.857 --> 02:32:45.499]  And they're arrogant, and they have a right to rule, and they'll rob your ship, and they'll kidnap you, and they'll kill you in a minute!
[02:32:45.779 --> 02:32:50.541]  And they'll come to your country, and they'll tell you to bow to them, or you're a racist!
[02:32:50.921 --> 02:32:51.981]  And you know what you do when they do it?
[02:32:52.401 --> 02:32:56.022]  You get on your knees to them, and you say, I'm a piece of crap slaver!
[02:32:56.323 --> 02:32:57.043]  I'm your slave!
[02:32:57.203 --> 02:32:59.443]  And Ilhan says, that's right, dirty American!
[02:32:59.644 --> 02:33:00.724]  You're mine now!
[02:33:06.280 --> 02:33:09.003]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.791 --> 02:33:23.662]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[02:33:32.973 --> 02:33:37.496]  Alright, alright.
[02:33:37.717 --> 02:33:38.777]  Welcome back!
[02:33:40.319 --> 02:33:44.422]  We've been having an awesome conversation with Robert Burns.
[02:33:46.084 --> 02:33:46.444]  You know what?
[02:33:46.504 --> 02:33:58.214]  I want to play this clip and I want to get your opinion on this clip and the situation that's going on and how the left is driving this whole white supremacist thing.
[02:33:58.874 --> 02:34:00.476]  And for me it's a pet peeve because
[02:34:01.544 --> 02:34:10.870]  Through my entire working career, I've had many white people help me, and I know for a fact they didn't help me because I'm black.
[02:34:11.351 --> 02:34:12.592]  That has nothing to do with it.
[02:34:13.012 --> 02:34:13.993]  Can you do the job?
[02:34:14.173 --> 02:34:15.354]  Or can you not do the job?
[02:34:15.474 --> 02:34:17.095]  Do you want to do the job?
[02:34:17.115 --> 02:34:22.438]  Because I've known black people, they say, oh, I want to do the job, but then they don't want to do the job.
[02:34:23.459 --> 02:34:24.361]  Let's go to this clip.
[02:34:24.381 --> 02:34:25.884]  This clip was with MSNBC.
[02:34:26.486 --> 02:34:28.530]  MSNBC Crazy C, in my opinion.
[02:34:29.191 --> 02:34:30.274]  And we'll talk.
[02:34:30.314 --> 02:34:31.676]  I'll get your opinion on it when we come back.
[02:34:32.759 --> 02:34:36.962]  We have to be able to call out the lies that he's saying, and also the destructive policies that he's putting out.
[02:34:37.242 --> 02:34:38.803]  Today, he told 13 lies.
[02:34:38.843 --> 02:34:43.026]  He's also, like you said, he's dismantling the protection for endangered species.
[02:34:43.046 --> 02:34:45.387]  Which is not a partisan matter, by the way.
[02:34:45.728 --> 02:34:46.988]  It never has been a partisan matter.
[02:34:47.028 --> 02:34:54.033]  Republicans and Democrats both agreed, and Republicans and conservatives and liberals the world over agree, to protect endangered species.
[02:34:54.133 --> 02:34:59.757]  Right, but this administration doesn't want to protect anything or anyone other than white supremacy.
[02:34:59.938 --> 02:35:00.878]  So that's just the fact.
[02:35:00.918 --> 02:35:02.600]  But we have to do the work.
[02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:09.024]  And that's the thing, is that all of this gaslighting, all of the lies, it keeps us spinning so that we can't pay attention to everything.
[02:35:09.265 --> 02:35:12.707]  But that's the work that Donald Trump has put on our plates.
[02:35:12.947 --> 02:35:23.836]  We have to tell the truth about who he is, what he's doing, how he's manipulating the public, and also tell the truth about the policies and who he's hurting and why he's hurting them.
[02:35:24.076 --> 02:35:28.822]  Rick Wilson, 15 seconds to you on, are there enough Republicans to do something about this?
[02:35:30.124 --> 02:35:30.824]  Absolutely not.
[02:35:30.865 --> 02:35:34.910]  There are no Republicans who will stand up and be brave and tell the President he's a lying liar.
[02:35:35.530 --> 02:35:36.291]  Alright, B-roll it.
[02:35:37.273 --> 02:35:38.674]  Alright, so...
[02:35:40.057 --> 02:35:42.160]  This is exactly what I've been talking about.
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:44.342]  This is the craziness of the left.
[02:35:44.362 --> 02:35:52.511]  They're trying to say that President Trump is the one that's creating all of this racial division, trying to get all of us fighting each other, and it's none of this true.
[02:35:53.232 --> 02:35:54.073]  None of this is true.
[02:35:54.354 --> 02:35:59.199]  Everything that they sit there and blame President Trump for doing, they're the ones that's doing that.
[02:36:00.080 --> 02:36:01.401]  We see it constantly.
[02:36:01.862 --> 02:36:03.523]  And they have nothing.
[02:36:03.563 --> 02:36:06.385]  They can't get President Trump on any policies that he's done wrong.
[02:36:06.665 --> 02:36:12.070]  They can't get President Trump for saying stuff, you know, this blatantly that is racist because he hasn't said it.
[02:36:12.490 --> 02:36:16.313]  And they can't get him on anything that he's doing bad for the economy.
[02:36:16.774 --> 02:36:18.815]  I've been to the White House twice.
[02:36:19.776 --> 02:36:21.276]  Invitation from President Trump.
[02:36:21.637 --> 02:36:23.317]  Twice to the White House.
[02:36:23.757 --> 02:36:29.539]  Why would he invite someone like me and other black people to the White House if he's a white supremacist?
[02:36:29.839 --> 02:36:37.221]  And on top of that, he did not go out himself and say, look everybody, I have black people coming to the White House.
[02:36:37.461 --> 02:36:38.161]  He didn't do that.
[02:36:39.201 --> 02:36:45.103]  His main thing was, look, I'm the President of the United States, I'm the President of all people, and that's what I'm here for.
[02:36:45.443 --> 02:36:46.563]  So, Robert Burns.
[02:36:48.291 --> 02:36:53.053]  Let me ask you, do you think that they're doing this because they have nothing else?
[02:36:53.993 --> 02:37:01.736]  I mean, they have nothing else to lead on, because everything that he's been doing for the American people has been 100% positive, and black people are benefiting.
[02:37:02.176 --> 02:37:12.960]  And because of that, it's 36%, I believe that it's more, support from the black community, but they don't want people to recognize it, so they have to demonize him to make it look like that he is bad.
[02:37:15.146 --> 02:37:16.086]  I mean, there's no doubt about it.
[02:37:16.166 --> 02:37:27.629]  I mean, really, this started around 2014 in Obama's second term, when Obama failed to deliver the benefits that he promised, particularly African-American voters in the United States.
[02:37:28.209 --> 02:37:31.829]  So really, if you go back, this goes back to a political trend in the United States.
[02:37:32.650 --> 02:37:43.992]  After the civil war, African-American voters became deeply loyal to the Republican Party, understandably, because they were perceived as the party that freed the slaves.
[02:37:44.949 --> 02:37:53.969]  But the problem was the Republican Party failed to deliver any tangible benefits after that to African American voters going on consecutively for 60 plus years.
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:38:08.514]  And that's why I always say about the nature of racial politics is that the Republican Party continued to sort of wave the bloody shirt, they called it, of, hey, well, we did something great 50, 60, 70 years ago, so keep voting for us for that reason.
[02:38:08.874 --> 02:38:13.399]  And it was successful enough that most African-American voters, even in the Depression in 1932, stayed Republican.
[02:38:15.601 --> 02:38:31.850]  Well, by 1936, 1940, they started realizing why are we voting for a party that is delivering us nothing but rhetoric, that is delivering nothing but empty symbolism, that is delivering nothing but language, that's not giving us real policies, real benefits for real lives in a material and moral way.
[02:38:32.430 --> 02:38:45.783]  And the African-American voter poses that challenge down to the Democratic Party, because the Democratic Party was mostly actually on the segregation side, but was associated because of Lyndon Baines Johnson with civil rights in the mid-1960s.
[02:38:46.343 --> 02:38:49.146]  The Democratic Party has been living off of something they did 60 years ago.
[02:38:49.606 --> 02:38:54.149]  And they really haven't done anything meaningful to benefit African Americans in this country.
[02:38:54.609 --> 02:39:00.512]  In fact, it was Bill Clinton who did the mass incarceration plan, of which Joe Biden was integral and part of.
[02:39:01.293 --> 02:39:07.056]  It was during Democratic administrations that African American unemployment went up, particularly amongst working class men.
[02:39:07.916 --> 02:39:12.359]  It was under Democratic administrations, particularly Obama's latest administration.
[02:39:12.939 --> 02:39:17.880]  Where the threat of illegal immigration kept replacing African-Americans in the employment market.
[02:39:18.180 --> 02:39:29.103]  It's not a coincidence that after these recent ICE raids, the number one beneficiary of the people applying for those jobs in poultry plants in Mississippi and elsewhere were disproportionately African-American men.
[02:39:29.763 --> 02:39:41.006]  So, in fact, it's not a coincidence that the aggregate set of policies the president has put into place in terms of changing trade policy vis-a-vis China, which had a deeply destabilizing
[02:39:41.769 --> 02:39:41.909]  Yes.
[02:40:01.096 --> 02:40:03.780]  In the history of that statistic even being recorded.
[02:40:04.301 --> 02:40:06.664]  And that's why the Democratic Party is panicking.
[02:40:07.125 --> 02:40:15.437]  Because they know logically, the key, this is one of the key factors when Van Jones was going on his white lash and all that stuff during the election night.
[02:40:16.438 --> 02:40:22.303]  I was telling people in London, where I had a nice big bet on President Trump, what I said really said just the opposite.
[02:40:22.644 --> 02:40:30.350]  The key to the president winning Michigan was that African American men, double digit and by double digit percentage numbers, shifted from Obama to Trump.
[02:40:30.651 --> 02:40:34.854]  The same thing happened in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Pennsylvania.
[02:40:35.134 --> 02:40:37.296]  Same thing happened in Milwaukee and Wisconsin.
[02:40:37.556 --> 02:40:42.701]  If it wasn't for African American men voting for Trump by double digit margin improvement,
[02:40:43.181 --> 02:40:48.324]  Over what they voted in 2012, Trump is not elected the President of the United States.
[02:40:48.745 --> 02:40:51.306]  So Trump knows this, the people who oppose Trump know this.
[02:40:51.646 --> 02:41:00.252]  So their problem is Trump keeps delivering in massive amounts for African American men in particular, but for voters across the board and working class voters across the board.
[02:41:00.652 --> 02:41:08.076]  But African American men have probably benefited as much as any demographic group in the country from the President's set of policies than anybody.
[02:41:08.596 --> 02:41:10.017]  And the Democrats know that.
[02:41:10.397 --> 02:41:14.059]  So how do they get them to stay on the Democrat plantation?
[02:41:14.199 --> 02:41:15.619]  Stay within the Democrat fold?
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:16.700]  Call racism!
[02:41:17.608 --> 02:41:19.249]  Exactly.
[02:41:20.891 --> 02:41:22.552]  Make Trump look like he's boss hog.
[02:41:22.592 --> 02:41:25.054]  Make Trump look like that scary racist.
[02:41:25.274 --> 02:41:27.556]  Make Trump look like that racist boss that harassed you.
[02:41:27.576 --> 02:41:29.538]  The racist cop who harassed you.
[02:41:29.578 --> 02:41:31.119]  They've got to associate him with that.
[02:41:31.399 --> 02:41:38.465]  And the problem is, Trump has been popular with an African American male culture, particularly, for a long time.
[02:41:38.705 --> 02:41:40.066]  That's why he's featured in rap songs.
[02:41:40.246 --> 02:41:42.468]  My old client Wesley Snipes used to reference him.
[02:41:42.768 --> 02:41:43.308]  Yeah.
[02:41:43.928 --> 02:41:45.709]  They did it in hip-hop music.
[02:41:45.749 --> 02:41:46.469]  They referenced him.
[02:41:46.529 --> 02:41:47.849]  I want to be like Trump.
[02:41:47.969 --> 02:41:50.510]  I mean, they say, I want to be like Trump.
[02:41:50.530 --> 02:41:51.970]  And these are black people saying it.
[02:41:52.370 --> 02:42:04.913]  And you know, it's amazing to me that you have, and maybe you've seen this in history, where a white person started doing something, not specifically just directly helping black people, but black people benefit like never before.
[02:42:05.393 --> 02:42:06.834]  Then they play the race card.
[02:42:07.174 --> 02:42:09.455]  Oh, we've got to stop this train.
[02:42:09.795 --> 02:42:10.996]  Where is it going?
[02:42:11.336 --> 02:42:14.398]  Because if we don't, we're going to lose them off this plantation.
[02:42:14.778 --> 02:42:21.922]  I've had conversations with black people, and a lot of times they show up to these different events, and they have on these plastic chains on their hands and their feet.
[02:42:22.282 --> 02:42:25.284]  And I say, you know those shackles that you have on your hands and feet?
[02:42:25.344 --> 02:42:26.404]  And some of them are virtual.
[02:42:26.945 --> 02:42:30.427]  I said, those shackles that you have on your hands and feet, they don't have any locks.
[02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:32.641]  And I said, you can take them off.
[02:42:32.961 --> 02:42:34.561]  Then they get upset with me.
[02:42:34.581 --> 02:42:35.662]  What do you mean I can take them off?
[02:42:35.842 --> 02:42:39.643]  How dare you tell me I can take these shackles off my hands and feet?
[02:42:40.004 --> 02:42:41.364]  I want to be enslaved.
[02:42:41.644 --> 02:42:44.725]  I like this Democrat plantation because they keep me.
[02:42:45.266 --> 02:42:45.886]  What is it?
[02:42:45.946 --> 02:42:46.246]  Daddy.
[02:42:46.486 --> 02:42:48.187]  Daddy government protects me.
[02:42:48.267 --> 02:42:50.708]  Daddy government gives me everything I need.
[02:42:51.048 --> 02:42:51.548]  I love it.
[02:42:51.568 --> 02:42:53.149]  The government protects me.
[02:42:53.329 --> 02:42:57.110]  The government is my daddy because they got rid of the fathers out of the household.
[02:42:57.330 --> 02:42:58.371]  And that's where we are today.
[02:42:58.431 --> 02:42:59.891]  This is the Infowars.com.
[02:42:59.932 --> 02:43:00.832]  We'll be back after this.
[02:43:02.213 --> 02:43:04.034]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[02:43:04.314 --> 02:43:06.075]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[02:43:06.416 --> 02:43:07.797]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[02:43:08.177 --> 02:43:09.097]  But I'll be honest with you.
[02:43:09.938 --> 02:43:14.341]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[02:43:15.261 --> 02:43:16.942]  So, you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[02:43:17.142 --> 02:43:17.723]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[02:43:18.443 --> 02:43:19.164]  But here's the bottom line.
[02:43:20.191 --> 02:43:21.453]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[02:43:21.673 --> 02:43:24.096]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[02:43:24.376 --> 02:43:25.137]  I don't want them to win.
[02:43:25.517 --> 02:43:27.540]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[02:43:28.441 --> 02:43:31.224]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[02:43:31.564 --> 02:43:34.327]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[02:43:34.728 --> 02:43:38.472]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[02:43:38.512 --> 02:43:39.734]  These will change your life.
[02:43:40.074 --> 02:43:41.456]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[02:43:41.476 --> 02:43:43.177]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[02:43:43.478 --> 02:43:44.138]  Check it all out.
[02:43:44.158 --> 02:43:45.780]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[02:43:46.121 --> 02:43:47.722]  Be part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:43:47.922 --> 02:43:49.104]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[02:43:49.404 --> 02:43:50.545]  You'll get great products at the same time.
[02:43:50.886 --> 02:43:53.028]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[02:43:53.348 --> 02:43:55.290]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[02:43:55.531 --> 02:43:58.634]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[02:44:02.594 --> 02:44:11.364]  Let me get into something briefly that is so paramount that it deals with the very essence of the soul and the spark of consciousness and creation.
[02:44:11.644 --> 02:44:15.428]  Every study documents what we already know in our heart and minds to be true.
[02:44:15.588 --> 02:44:18.671]  That apathy leads to entropy, leads to collapse.
[02:44:18.892 --> 02:44:23.637]  And that if you don't have a purpose-driven life, you will die before your body fails.
[02:44:23.937 --> 02:44:30.742]  Apathy, most common symptom of dementia, science daily, distinct from depression, present in nearly half of patients.
[02:44:30.922 --> 02:44:32.483]  This is out of the University of Exeter.
[02:44:32.663 --> 02:44:42.650]  Apathy is the most common neuropsychiatric symptom of dementia, with a bigger impact on the functioning than memory loss, yet is under-researched and often forgotten.
[02:44:42.810 --> 02:44:48.574]  And our very way of life is now sitting in front of screens, clicking on things to get dopamine rushes.
[02:44:48.834 --> 02:44:53.537]  And so when you go out in the real world, you don't get a dopamine rush off an owl flying over.
[02:44:53.797 --> 02:44:58.498]  A hawk, or the moon, or airplanes flying in the sky like we're in a science fiction movie.
[02:44:58.558 --> 02:45:00.218]  We are science fiction reality.
[02:45:00.278 --> 02:45:09.400]  And just the magic of the universe and these experiences of falling off your bike, or jumping a dirt hill, or getting in a fist fight, or kissing that girl for the first time.
[02:45:09.540 --> 02:45:19.302]  These are deep experiences that our ancestors experienced that are rituals within us that open up the gateways to perception in the universe.
[02:45:19.462 --> 02:45:21.043]  We must go through the rituals.
[02:45:21.203 --> 02:45:22.983]  That's why the enemy tries to domesticate people
[02:45:23.063 --> 02:45:28.329]  Nobody knows how to do math anymore because we use calculators and soon we won't know how to drive cars anymore because they're all going to be self-driving.
[02:45:28.549 --> 02:45:42.105]  This system is designed to dehumanize us and the people that run it admit they're doing it to dehumanize us because they want us out of the way so the globalists can control the future and so they can dictate the new architecture
[02:45:42.265 --> 02:45:50.292]  And so, instead of just physically killing us right away, they kill our intellect, they kill our spark, they kill that which makes us higher than the animals.
[02:45:50.512 --> 02:45:57.378]  That we can control our own environments, and that we can control our own destinies to a certain extent, and that we can envision things, and then build those things.
[02:45:57.599 --> 02:45:58.659]  That we're master builders.
[02:45:58.860 --> 02:46:00.321]  But when you dial into the universe...
[02:46:00.661 --> 02:46:23.053]  And the mystic secrets and all the magic and the real potential and the ancestral memories and the ancestral will that is, again, electromagnetic, electrochemical from you to your most ancient ancestor is an unbroken electromagnetic chain of genetic information that operates as an antenna to receive and transmit as a transceiver into higher dimensions.
[02:46:23.233 --> 02:46:24.694]  This has all been proven scientifically.
[02:46:24.734 --> 02:46:28.836]  The enemy can't stand it when I get on air because I already know all their equations, their operations,
[02:46:28.916 --> 02:46:30.377]  And then, of course, later I can go out and research.
[02:46:30.417 --> 02:46:33.420]  They've written and said exactly this, but in their more secretive reports.
[02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:37.663]  Let me just tell you, I'm giving you the big enchilada, okay?
[02:46:38.183 --> 02:46:38.844]  Oh, we're real.
[02:46:39.204 --> 02:46:39.945]  Oh, we're eternal.
[02:46:40.926 --> 02:46:43.588]  And they don't want you to know that because you're awesome.
[02:46:43.748 --> 02:46:50.654]  And they want to lead you with them into their creation that is a leaking, stinking hellhole.
[02:46:50.894 --> 02:46:53.756]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[02:46:53.916 --> 02:46:57.959]  Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth.
[02:46:59.062 --> 02:46:59.983]  As it is in heaven!
[02:47:00.263 --> 02:47:01.924]  It's all in plain view, people!
[02:47:06.206 --> 02:47:08.848]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.737 --> 02:47:28.519]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[02:47:28.799 --> 02:47:35.203]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Will Johnson.
[02:47:36.904 --> 02:47:40.226]  Alright, last segment of this hour.
[02:47:40.246 --> 02:47:42.587]  I have Robert Barnes on with me.
[02:47:42.607 --> 02:47:45.149]  I've been having a great conversation.
[02:47:45.409 --> 02:47:49.391]  I love this conversation that we're having and this wealth of information.
[02:47:50.472 --> 02:47:50.752]  You know,
[02:47:52.071 --> 02:47:59.497]  The left have controlled black people and brown people for the longest.
[02:48:00.278 --> 02:48:04.001]  And they demonized back in the, I guess, like the 50s and the 60s.
[02:48:04.541 --> 02:48:06.082]  They demonized black people.
[02:48:06.123 --> 02:48:07.163]  And I'm talking about the left.
[02:48:07.203 --> 02:48:08.705]  They demonized black people.
[02:48:09.465 --> 02:48:12.748]  And they didn't want black people to be successful in the country.
[02:48:12.788 --> 02:48:14.830]  They didn't even want black people to be able to read.
[02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:21.935]  They didn't want black people to, you know, to thrive, to have their own businesses, to have bank accounts.
[02:48:21.975 --> 02:48:23.617]  They didn't want black people to have any of that.
[02:48:23.657 --> 02:48:26.519]  They wanted black people to stay and remain on the plantation.
[02:48:27.159 --> 02:48:28.400]  And they attacked black people.
[02:48:28.441 --> 02:48:29.481]  They hung black people.
[02:48:29.541 --> 02:48:31.443]  They did horrible things to black people.
[02:48:31.943 --> 02:48:34.525]  They said black people were attacking all white women.
[02:48:35.246 --> 02:48:37.568]  Now, fast forward to 2019,
[02:48:40.350 --> 02:48:48.597]  The attack, the same group, the same entity, the left, the Democrats, the entire left, now they're attacking white people.
[02:48:49.458 --> 02:48:52.780]  And it's unbelievable that it's absolutely happening like this.
[02:48:53.121 --> 02:48:58.425]  For some reason, people still don't recognize what is absolutely happening here.
[02:48:59.246 --> 02:49:00.147]  Have you noticed that?
[02:49:00.207 --> 02:49:02.008]  Or is it just something that I'm seeing?
[02:49:03.229 --> 02:49:05.771]  Well, I think it's part of a broader reflection.
[02:49:05.831 --> 02:49:07.533]  It's a different form of contempt.
[02:49:08.169 --> 02:49:26.880]  So the in the same way when they do studies and they show white liberals talk down to African Americans when they interact with them in any sort of context or space, that disproportionately in sort of white left or upscale white liberal communities, they try to exclude African Americans from those communities disproportionately in terms of public housing and other projects.
[02:49:27.421 --> 02:49:37.787]  But you also see it's sort of a broader psychological reflection that Professor Christopher Lash, University of Rochester, documented a couple of decades ago when he was talking about the rise of elitism in general.
[02:49:38.327 --> 02:49:42.590]  And what he pointed out is that when you treat someone like a victim, it's a form of contempt.
[02:49:43.090 --> 02:49:45.272]  Pity is almost always a form of contempt.
[02:49:45.712 --> 02:49:47.033]  It's not a form of respect.
[02:49:47.433 --> 02:49:49.935]  When you respect someone, you see them as an equal.
[02:49:50.295 --> 02:49:55.378]  You see them as equally capable, equally talented, equally in every respect.
[02:49:55.814 --> 02:50:06.741]  But when you see them as something less than you, then the way in which you can pretend to be racially progressive, while in fact being racially oppressive, is to treat them as a victim.
[02:50:07.021 --> 02:50:08.182]  You say, you know, you're weak.
[02:50:08.622 --> 02:50:09.663]  You're not capable.
[02:50:09.723 --> 02:50:10.123]  Exactly.
[02:50:10.143 --> 02:50:19.810]  You know, they even tell black people that, you know what, you can't, I mean, they go against voter ID because black people can't even find the DMV, according to the left.
[02:50:20.470 --> 02:50:25.091]  I mean, oh yeah, black people, they're, you know, they need our help because they're victims.
[02:50:25.451 --> 02:50:27.011]  You can't find a DMV.
[02:50:27.712 --> 02:50:31.052]  You know, you don't know who to vote for, so we're gonna help you.
[02:50:31.452 --> 02:50:32.553]  Let me change the subject here.
[02:50:32.573 --> 02:50:33.753]  So they just brought this to me.
[02:50:33.933 --> 02:50:38.754]  It says, universal movies portray sixth graders playing with sex toys.
[02:50:39.174 --> 02:50:42.935]  So now they just had a movie where they want to attack deplorables.
[02:50:43.939 --> 02:50:47.062]  And now they have a movie coming out with sixth graders playing with sex toys?
[02:50:47.262 --> 02:50:48.343]  When does it end?
[02:50:49.244 --> 02:50:50.865]  When does it end with insanity?
[02:50:51.065 --> 02:50:55.789]  And you know, talking about children, these people are monsters.
[02:50:55.809 --> 02:51:01.995]  You have Epstein, he supposedly killed himself, but you know, you have the entire left, they attack
[02:51:02.515 --> 02:51:10.342]  People, anybody who goes against pedophilia, you have them all going on and we're supposed to just sit back and be like, oh, this is the norm.
[02:51:10.562 --> 02:51:11.403]  This is OK.
[02:51:11.743 --> 02:51:13.865]  And then on top of that, you have Tucker Carlson.
[02:51:14.545 --> 02:51:19.269]  You know, he's on vacation, but you know, rumor has it that he might be suspended because he spoke out.
[02:51:19.690 --> 02:51:24.353]  I watched Tucker Carlson enough to know that he will speak out saying, why are they doing this to Alex Jones?
[02:51:25.174 --> 02:51:26.095]  Why are they doing this?
[02:51:26.575 --> 02:51:28.077]  You know, is freedom of speech gone?
[02:51:28.397 --> 02:51:34.083]  He'll talk about the socialist tech companies and how they're attacking conservatives.
[02:51:34.563 --> 02:51:35.464]  What are your views on that?
[02:51:36.525 --> 02:51:37.707]  So, I think of a couple of things.
[02:51:37.847 --> 02:51:45.354]  One, it sort of relates to our topic about the way in which the Democrats are, by necessity, trying to re-racialize and polarize the politics.
[02:51:45.755 --> 02:51:49.078]  Most African American voters are culturally conservative.
[02:51:49.634 --> 02:51:51.476]  Most of them, they're generally pro-life.
[02:51:52.216 --> 02:51:55.539]  They're generally, they do not like the attempts to sexualize children.
[02:51:55.959 --> 02:51:59.482]  They do not, they don't want to have anything to do with the Epstein's of the world.
[02:52:00.703 --> 02:52:13.073]  As the, so it's part of why they have to continually elevate racial identity politics above everything else, is because it's the only area where they can try to keep African American voters in their corner.
[02:52:13.333 --> 02:52:15.775]  Because on almost every other issue of money or morals,
[02:52:16.135 --> 02:52:23.478]  The Democratic Party has abandoned the African-American community and is contrary to the broad cultural traditions of the African-American community.
[02:52:23.899 --> 02:52:33.423]  But also it just reflects what the Epstein experience reflects, not only how the Alex Jones frame of the world, that worldview,
[02:52:34.321 --> 02:52:36.002]  Yeah, I think it's a great question.
[02:52:36.022 --> 02:52:36.962]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:37.002 --> 02:52:37.803]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:37.823 --> 02:52:39.043]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:39.063 --> 02:52:40.424]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:40.444 --> 02:52:42.305]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:42.325 --> 02:52:43.686]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:43.706 --> 02:52:44.606]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:44.646 --> 02:52:45.787]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:45.807 --> 02:52:47.307]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:47.347 --> 02:52:48.508]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:48.568 --> 02:52:50.089]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:50.109 --> 02:52:50.769]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:50.929 --> 02:52:51.990]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:52.010 --> 02:52:53.871]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:54.051 --> 02:52:55.331]  I think it's a great question.
[02:52:55.351 --> 02:52:56.972]  I think it's a great question.
[02:53:00.894 --> 02:53:02.435]  We're good to go.
[02:53:17.405 --> 02:53:22.489]  And so it's a part of a lack of moral compass that animates them across the board.
[02:53:22.529 --> 02:53:28.394]  When I try to explain to people what the InfoWars audience and Alex Jones is about, I say really it's united by two principles.
[02:53:28.654 --> 02:53:29.955]  It's not partisan principles.
[02:53:30.255 --> 02:53:32.237]  It's not a particular academic principle.
[02:53:32.557 --> 02:53:35.639]  It's a principle of being anti-authoritarian and pro-human.
[02:53:36.079 --> 02:53:45.767]  And what he recognizes, the reason why the Alex Jones worldview helps better explain the world and predict the world and forecast the world and foreshadow future events,
[02:53:46.027 --> 02:53:57.651]  Like Epstein, than almost any other worldview out there, is because he understands that people in disproportionate positions of power, and the elites when they haven't obtained that power, are disproportionately lack a moral compass.
[02:53:58.031 --> 02:54:02.332]  Their desire for power, the way they seek power, they try to misuse it and abuse it.
[02:54:02.612 --> 02:54:06.113]  That's why they try to treat all African Americans as victims, not as real human beings.
[02:54:06.414 --> 02:54:09.355]  That's why they look to sexualized children and underage behavior.
[02:54:09.735 --> 02:54:12.335]  Epstein kept insisting it was just totally normal what he was doing.
[02:54:13.976 --> 02:54:15.137]  They all say it's normal.
[02:54:15.317 --> 02:54:16.018]  And you know what?
[02:54:16.058 --> 02:54:18.440]  And then when you speak out against it, they want to look bad at you.
[02:54:18.781 --> 02:54:19.101]  You know what?
[02:54:19.641 --> 02:54:23.465]  I know, I have a, I call him a friend, uh, Terrence Williams.
[02:54:23.985 --> 02:54:28.029]  He put a video out there and it went, what, 5.3 million views.
[02:54:28.450 --> 02:54:36.978]  And now you have leftist sending him messages telling him that he needs to watch his back because he's talking about how Epstein and how the Clintons may have played a part in it.
[02:54:37.518 --> 02:54:48.020]  Why would they allow that on these socialist tech platforms when bullying goes against their community standards?
[02:54:48.100 --> 02:54:58.703]  But it's okay to bully a conservative and attack conservatives, but when you say something against a liberal and they get triggered, oh you hurt my feelings!
[02:54:59.483 --> 02:55:01.763]  You got to go, you hurt my feelings!
[02:55:02.864 --> 02:55:03.864]  It's ridiculous.
[02:55:04.744 --> 02:55:06.806]  Well, because it's entirely a pretext for power.
[02:55:07.186 --> 02:55:18.235]  So, for example, it's like the abuse of rape allegations by parts of the feminist community on college campuses and the moral panic they helped try to create and how they're misusing and abusing the Me Too movement.
[02:55:18.615 --> 02:55:19.456]  It's about power.
[02:55:19.896 --> 02:55:21.598]  It's not about protecting women.
[02:55:21.738 --> 02:55:24.700]  It's not about preventing bad behavior.
[02:55:25.101 --> 02:55:28.003]  It's about protecting power and expanding power.
[02:55:28.083 --> 02:55:29.084]  It's a tool to power.
[02:55:29.444 --> 02:55:32.807]  Everything is in their sort of Foucault mindset and mentality.
[02:55:33.227 --> 02:55:36.048]  Language itself is just a means to acquire and attain power.
[02:55:36.308 --> 02:55:37.729]  That's why it has no consistent meaning.
[02:55:38.189 --> 02:55:43.111]  In the legal academy, most of the left doesn't really believe in consistent standards at all.
[02:55:43.351 --> 02:55:45.751]  They don't believe in what is good for the goose is good for the gander.
[02:55:46.052 --> 02:55:48.232]  They believe you should discriminate in the judiciary.
[02:55:48.492 --> 02:55:50.133]  They believe you should target politically.
[02:55:50.453 --> 02:55:53.254]  Because in their mindset, it's power that justifies itself.
[02:55:53.774 --> 02:55:58.736]  And that everything else is just a pretext, a pretense, for the exercise of that power.
[02:55:59.216 --> 02:56:04.720]  I mean, the degree to which they're going to try to cover up what happened with Epstein is really going to be fun to watch.
[02:56:04.740 --> 02:56:04.900]  Yeah.
[02:56:04.940 --> 02:56:08.263]  I mean, it's like them trying to do Oswald in live time.
[02:56:08.583 --> 02:56:13.426]  Because, like, today they're talking about, hey, well, you know, the two guards, they just fell asleep and falsified the records.
[02:56:13.727 --> 02:56:13.967]  Right.
[02:56:13.987 --> 02:56:16.249]  But I do a lot of these cases.
[02:56:16.309 --> 02:56:26.436]  When you're looking at these cases, what you'll find is that they are monitoring the guards' activity at all times, both with other supervisors physically and personally, and by cameras everywhere.
[02:56:26.856 --> 02:56:32.638]  So how did the supervisors not notice that these guys were supposedly asleep for three hours?
[02:56:32.658 --> 02:56:33.738]  But nothing happened here.
[02:56:34.199 --> 02:56:35.039]  Nothing happened here.
[02:56:35.079 --> 02:56:36.119]  Nothing unusual.
[02:56:36.139 --> 02:56:37.840]  This is all normal.
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:40.721]  There's nothing that you need to look at.
[02:56:40.741 --> 02:56:42.661]  There's no questions you need to ask.
[02:56:43.022 --> 02:56:50.744]  If you ask any questions about it, or if you think for yourself about it, then you're going to be considered the enemy of the state.
[02:56:51.004 --> 02:56:52.765]  Because that's not the agenda.
[02:56:53.045 --> 02:56:55.806]  That's not the movement that we want to push.
[02:56:56.346 --> 02:57:01.508]  And anyone who goes against what they've been saying, you have to be demonized.
[02:57:01.788 --> 02:57:04.390]  Mr. Robert Barnes, thank you so much.
[02:57:04.690 --> 02:57:08.892]  It's been an honor and pleasure to sit here and to have the conversation with you.
[02:57:09.312 --> 02:57:13.514]  I look forward to the future to be able to do more and talk more with you.
[02:57:14.034 --> 02:57:14.834]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:14.894 --> 02:57:16.475]  Any last remarks in 30 seconds?
[02:57:17.372 --> 02:57:30.638]  Yeah, I just wanted to say that if the Clintons are watching, I believe it is a complete coincidence that the only person to die of suicide at MCC in the last 40 years is the guy who had lots of incriminatory information.
[02:57:31.138 --> 02:57:32.079]  Good point!
[02:57:32.139 --> 02:57:32.979]  Good point!
[02:57:33.039 --> 02:57:33.679]  Good point!
[02:57:33.799 --> 02:57:37.361]  Alright, so we have Paul Watson coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:57:37.381 --> 02:57:38.842]  I want to thank everyone.
[02:57:38.862 --> 02:57:39.982]  My name is Will Johnson.
[02:57:40.002 --> 02:57:42.863]  My personal website, UnitesAmericaFirst.com.
[02:57:43.384 --> 02:57:43.884]  Thank you.
[02:57:44.284 --> 02:57:44.924]  God bless you.
[02:57:44.944 --> 02:57:46.025]  We'll be back after this.
[02:57:53.437 --> 02:58:06.686]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on air 25 years and I've never, at a gut level, felt the fire of war like I do right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:07.726 --> 02:58:09.488]  So many incredible things are happening.
[02:58:10.108 --> 02:58:11.929]  So many dangerous things are unfolding.
[02:58:12.550 --> 02:58:15.812]  And at a cellular level, at a spiritual gut level,
[02:58:17.185 --> 02:58:35.098]  At the heart of my gut, the heart of my mind, at every level, I can just feel the evil rage of the globalists, knowing that their plan for world government, and their plan for total censorship, and their plan for human-animal clones, and sex with children, and Satanism is in trouble.
[02:58:35.218 --> 02:58:38.501]  It can feel the spirit of Christ coming back into the world.
[02:58:38.621 --> 02:58:39.682]  There's gonna be a tribulation.
[02:58:40.242 --> 02:58:40.863]  During this fight.
[02:58:40.983 --> 02:58:43.545]  But the devil knows he's going to lose.
[02:58:43.805 --> 02:58:47.288]  The devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows his time is short.
[02:58:47.408 --> 02:58:49.710]  And I can feel Satan's rage.
[02:58:49.850 --> 02:58:50.711]  I know you can feel it.
[02:58:50.791 --> 02:58:52.712]  And they are planning a bloody revolution here.
[02:58:52.873 --> 02:58:55.735]  They're planning massive censorship across the country and the world.
[02:58:55.815 --> 02:58:59.398]  This is a time to be praying to Christ for justice and for freedom.
[02:58:59.498 --> 02:59:02.360]  And that God's spirit come into you and lead God and direct you.
[02:59:02.380 --> 02:59:05.403]  But it's also time to be politically and culturally active.
[02:59:05.543 --> 02:59:17.486]  And it's time to spread the word about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and override the AI sensors, to override their systems, and to let people know, hey, here's the name that must not be spoken.
[02:59:17.746 --> 02:59:18.987]  Here's what the world fears.
[02:59:19.207 --> 02:59:24.888]  Here's the guest and the information and the history and the analysis that is the cure to the globalist poison.
[02:59:25.028 --> 02:59:25.808]  InfoWars.
[02:59:26.109 --> 02:59:29.890]  Strength lies entirely with you and the action you take.
[02:59:30.130 --> 02:59:31.470]  You are the InfoWars.
[02:59:31.690 --> 02:59:38.135]  You are the resistance, and everything you do now will affect the battle space for billions of lives going to the future.
[02:59:38.796 --> 02:59:41.198]  The war has already begun, quote Patrick Henry.
[02:59:41.718 --> 02:59:43.359]  It's an information and spiritual war.
[02:59:44.260 --> 02:59:46.962]  The enemy's losing that war, so they want to make it a physical war.
[02:59:47.503 --> 02:59:48.684]  So prepare yourselves.
[02:59:49.324 --> 02:59:50.085]  You have been warned.
[02:59:55.129 --> 03:00:01.054]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.459 --> 03:00:17.861]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:00:18.442 --> 03:00:19.923]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:20.623 --> 03:00:23.805]  And now, your host, Will Johnson.
[03:00:27.186 --> 03:00:29.668]  Alright, it's been a wonderful ride.
[03:00:30.441 --> 03:00:34.745]  Will Johnson, UnitesAmericaFirst.com filling in for Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.745 --> 03:00:37.747]  We have Paul Watson coming up next.
[03:00:38.688 --> 03:00:41.470]  I'm a huge fan of Paul Watson.
[03:00:42.010 --> 03:00:44.873]  I've been following him on Twitter for a long time now.
[03:00:45.754 --> 03:00:48.896]  And I think I might put him on the spot here.
[03:00:48.976 --> 03:00:50.457]  Hope he doesn't get upset with me.
[03:00:51.058 --> 03:00:52.099]  But I'm going to ask Paul.
[03:00:52.159 --> 03:00:53.140]  Hey Paul, how you doing?
[03:00:53.760 --> 03:00:54.780]  How you doing, Will?
[03:00:54.820 --> 03:00:55.300]  How's it going?
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:00:55.840]  Great, great.
[03:00:55.880 --> 03:00:56.821]  Good to talk to you again.
[03:00:56.861 --> 03:01:00.141]  The last time I talked to you, I kind of like, uh, uh, I didn't know what to say or what to ask you.
[03:01:00.161 --> 03:01:01.542]  But now I know what I want to ask you.
[03:01:02.402 --> 03:01:04.482]  Can you, can I get you to follow me on Twitter?
[03:01:05.982 --> 03:01:06.943]  I'll do it right now.
[03:01:07.143 --> 03:01:07.943]  I'll do it right now.
[03:01:08.063 --> 03:01:11.183]  I would greatly, I mean, I was like, oh man, maybe I can get him to follow me.
[03:01:11.203 --> 03:01:11.704]  That'd be great.
[03:01:11.744 --> 03:01:15.924]  So, but anyways, I noticed during the break there, you were drinking some orange juice.
[03:01:15.964 --> 03:01:18.245]  Would you by chance have some Turbo Force in it?
[03:01:19.901 --> 03:01:20.742]  Not right now.
[03:01:20.762 --> 03:01:26.785]  I do have some TurboForce in the flat, but you have to go very careful with TurboForce, because it's that powerful.
[03:01:26.986 --> 03:01:27.806]  Yes, it is.
[03:01:27.866 --> 03:01:28.567]  Yes, it is.
[03:01:29.147 --> 03:01:31.288]  I put a whole thing in mine earlier, and I've been sipping on it.
[03:01:31.308 --> 03:01:36.211]  It was about up to here earlier, and I've been drinking it down to here, and right now I feel pumped up.
[03:01:36.271 --> 03:01:37.572]  I have so much energy.
[03:01:38.173 --> 03:01:44.156]  And the one thing that I really love about TurboForce, I don't get this crash that you get from these other energy drinks.
[03:01:45.197 --> 03:01:46.418]  And for me, it's just wonderful.
[03:01:47.310 --> 03:01:51.211]  A lot of them, they just put too much caffeine in and you get an immediate crash.
[03:01:51.271 --> 03:01:56.233]  But with that, I only take half a sachet to start off with because it is potent stuff.
[03:01:56.253 --> 03:01:58.734]  You know, you are correct.
[03:01:58.814 --> 03:01:59.114]  It is.
[03:01:59.174 --> 03:01:59.935]  It's pretty strong.
[03:01:59.955 --> 03:02:00.455]  It's pretty strong.
[03:02:00.475 --> 03:02:03.436]  That's why when you, especially your first time taking it,
[03:02:04.522 --> 03:02:06.583]  You know, Alex says, you know, take half a packet.
[03:02:07.143 --> 03:02:10.805]  He'll tell you to take half a packet because you'll be amazed on how good it really is.
[03:02:11.125 --> 03:02:14.527]  And it doesn't have all the bad side effects you get from these energy drinks.
[03:02:15.167 --> 03:02:15.608]  So cool.
[03:02:16.088 --> 03:02:17.749]  Hey, it's been an honor and a pleasure.
[03:02:17.769 --> 03:02:19.730]  I'll let you take it from here.
[03:02:19.750 --> 03:02:21.390]  All right.
[03:02:21.410 --> 03:02:21.651]  Thanks.
[03:02:21.691 --> 03:02:22.711]  Well, I'll take it from here.
[03:02:22.731 --> 03:02:25.893]  Yeah, we got a big raft of stories coming up on the show today.
[03:02:25.933 --> 03:02:32.836]  Obviously, we had the huge release of more Google manipulation censorship documents out of Project Veritas.
[03:02:33.336 --> 03:02:34.157]  What angers me?
[03:02:35.231 --> 03:02:35.871]  Continually.
[03:02:35.891 --> 03:02:44.494]  Is the mainstream media continuing to insist that there is no social media bias against conservatives when we see it at every turn?
[03:02:44.894 --> 03:02:49.115]  And I've actually posted the video up on Twitter a few hours ago.
[03:02:49.615 --> 03:02:51.276]  And this has been going on for months now.
[03:02:51.676 --> 03:02:54.277]  But it's getting worse and worse every time I check.
[03:02:54.957 --> 03:02:56.838]  And you can play the video from the article.
[03:02:56.898 --> 03:02:58.878]  It's up on Summit.News headline.
[03:02:59.458 --> 03:03:04.300]  New Project Veritas Leaks Prove Google Broke Its Own Search Engine To Censor Conservatives.
[03:03:05.423 --> 03:03:06.469]  My YouTube channel!
[03:03:07.876 --> 03:03:10.318]  You cannot find it by doing a Google search.
[03:03:10.658 --> 03:03:12.499]  YouTube is owned by Google.
[03:03:12.779 --> 03:03:17.742]  You can put in my name, Paul Joseph Watson YouTube channel, on a Google search.
[03:03:18.302 --> 03:03:21.424]  I checked the first 15 pages of search results.
[03:03:21.524 --> 03:03:23.445]  It did not come up once.
[03:03:23.926 --> 03:03:35.613]  The only results that come up are people doing impressions of me, hit pieces against me, people who have took my videos and uploaded them on their channels, which I don't even mind people doing, that's completely fair.
[03:03:36.353 --> 03:03:37.494]  No videos of mine
[03:03:38.251 --> 03:03:45.573]  In the first 15 page results of a YouTube search of my name and YouTube channel on Google.
[03:03:45.853 --> 03:03:50.835]  You check it on every other search engine, it comes up, pops up the very first link.
[03:03:51.215 --> 03:04:02.778]  How much longer are they going to pretend that there's no giant algorithmic bias against conservatives, which as Dr. Robert Epstein has proven, and in fact he testified in front of Congress about this,
[03:04:03.587 --> 03:04:08.391]  ...has been illustrated to shift millions of votes on election day.
[03:04:08.651 --> 03:04:16.097]  There is no purer, more brazen example of election meddling than Google's algorithmic manipulation.
[03:04:16.157 --> 03:04:17.538]  And you see it with my YouTube channel.
[03:04:17.838 --> 03:04:20.460]  You see it with other YouTube channels we've highlighted before.
[03:04:21.340 --> 03:04:37.004]  You can go on there, on YouTube's search engine, which by the way is the second biggest search engine in the world after Google itself, and search for direct headlines related to political figures, in quotation marks with the direct headline, and what do you get?
[03:04:37.324 --> 03:04:44.807]  You get a wall of mainstream media search results, which in many cases have nothing whatsoever to do with the search that you've performed.
[03:04:44.827 --> 03:04:46.387]  I find it difficult
[03:04:47.290 --> 03:04:57.118]  To actually find articles that I've written in the past, that other people have written in the past, to refer back to, on a day-to-day basis, because they've broken their own search engine.
[03:04:57.338 --> 03:04:58.559]  This is so brazen.
[03:04:58.839 --> 03:05:00.581]  We're gonna get into it more on the other side.
[03:05:00.601 --> 03:05:02.643]  InfoWars.com, don't go away.
[03:05:04.784 --> 03:05:08.427]  Well, today, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[03:05:09.208 --> 03:05:13.952]  I just devoured your cousin, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[03:05:34.906 --> 03:05:59.755]  What in the world's going on here?
[03:06:10.504 --> 03:06:11.406]  You found it.
[03:06:11.746 --> 03:06:13.228]  The tip of the spear.
[03:06:13.769 --> 03:06:16.213]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:16.773 --> 03:06:20.719]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:22.705 --> 03:06:36.172]  We have got a ton of news coming up including Volkswagen putting out an ad or attempting to put out a commercial in the United Kingdom which shows, God forbid, the horror of a woman caring for a baby in a pram.
[03:06:36.652 --> 03:06:44.196]  It was immediately banned after three people complained because according to the Advertising Standards Agency in the UK,
[03:06:45.251 --> 03:06:48.295]  It furthers gender stereotypes.
[03:06:48.395 --> 03:06:54.162]  God forbid you would have a portrayal of a woman caring for a baby in 2019.
[03:06:54.502 --> 03:06:55.884]  That is verboten.
[03:06:56.384 --> 03:06:56.745]  Of course.
[03:06:57.737 --> 03:07:05.600]  You can have ads showing men being complete idiots and klotzes on commercials, which has been the case for the past 20, 30 years across the board.
[03:07:05.960 --> 03:07:07.161]  That's completely fine.
[03:07:07.541 --> 03:07:14.063]  You can have ads for the homophobic country of Brunei that still stones gay people to death on the London Underground.
[03:07:14.103 --> 03:07:15.144]  That's completely fine.
[03:07:15.704 --> 03:07:20.246]  But you can't show an ad featuring a woman with a bikini body.
[03:07:20.406 --> 03:07:21.206]  That was banned.
[03:07:21.626 --> 03:07:23.167]  Very interesting double standard.
[03:07:23.187 --> 03:07:25.428]  We're going to get into that later on in the show.
[03:07:26.505 --> 03:07:46.598]  But I want to start off with this new document dump from Project Veritas, which again only confirms in triplicate what we've already been experiencing for the past two years, plus the past three years since the election, when, of course, Google executives got up in front of a meeting and sounded off about how they could not possibly let this happen again, i.e.
[03:07:46.999 --> 03:07:49.120]  a populist or Trump getting elected.
[03:07:49.880 --> 03:07:53.543]  And they've certainly took a lot of steps in the interim to prevent that from happening.
[03:07:54.545 --> 03:07:56.645]  Trump administration has reacted too late.
[03:07:56.685 --> 03:07:59.906]  We've heard this social media executive order is in the pipeline.
[03:07:59.926 --> 03:08:02.647]  We've been hearing that for the best part of six months now.
[03:08:03.327 --> 03:08:04.607]  Nothing has happened so far.
[03:08:04.907 --> 03:08:06.748]  But now we have this out of Breitbart.
[03:08:07.828 --> 03:08:10.348]  Project Veritas Google whistleblower goes public.
[03:08:10.808 --> 03:08:13.149]  I saw something dark and nefarious going on.
[03:08:13.709 --> 03:08:18.430]  Now I think this guy had already released some information but his identity was shadowed.
[03:08:18.910 --> 03:08:20.591]  Now he's gone completely public.
[03:08:20.911 --> 03:08:22.311]  This is Zachary Voorhees.
[03:08:23.041 --> 03:08:37.310]  He says he's come forward because he, quote, saw something dark and nefarious going on with the company and realized that they were going to not only tamper with the elections, but use that tampering with the elections to essentially overthrow the United States.
[03:08:37.390 --> 03:08:43.074]  This is the severity of what we're talking about with social media, algorithmic manipulation and censorship.
[03:08:43.714 --> 03:08:45.315]  As I said in the previous segment,
[03:08:46.218 --> 03:09:06.057]  Dr Robert Epstein has done exhaustive studies of major elections, in one case the biggest election in the world, the Indian election, and he found that by simply ranking certain search results above others on election day, on the days before election day, you can swing the outcome of an entire election.
[03:09:06.717 --> 03:09:09.280]  Bearing in mind for the past two years plus we've had the media
[03:09:10.242 --> 03:09:19.906]  Fear mongering, creating this moral panic that because some Russian spent $3,000 on Facebook ads, that that is election manipulation, that that is election meddling.
[03:09:20.486 --> 03:09:30.330]  It's a drop in the ocean to how Google has broken its own search engine by putting certain websites and certain people on blacklists.
[03:09:30.390 --> 03:09:31.991]  And who do you think is on that blacklist?
[03:09:32.971 --> 03:09:34.732]  You can look at the search terms as well.
[03:09:35.754 --> 03:09:48.100]  This came out today and it's a list of search terms from Google's query blacklist relating to the shooting in Las Vegas, the Stephen Paddock massacre in October 2017.
[03:09:49.713 --> 03:10:01.718]  And they've basically locked down all the keywords that would question that event, despite the fact that, as we know, the motive behind that massacre has not been revealed in the near two years since it happened.
[03:10:02.138 --> 03:10:04.359]  But they don't want anyone investigating it.
[03:10:04.399 --> 03:10:05.660]  They don't want anyone looking into it.
[03:10:05.700 --> 03:10:13.243]  They don't want any search results popping up at the top of Google that could actually give anyone an insight into what actually happened.
[03:10:14.264 --> 03:10:16.545]  Gateway Pundits have been reporting on this all day as well.
[03:10:16.585 --> 03:10:17.345]  We have a headline here.
[03:10:18.058 --> 03:10:33.961]  Project Veritas leaked Google documents prove tech giant is censoring Rush Limbaugh, Gateway Pundit, Newsbusters, MRCTV, Daily Caller, and of course on that list is InfoWars.com, Alex Jones Channel, when it existed, and many others.
[03:10:34.341 --> 03:10:37.742]  Basically all of them conservative right-wing websites.
[03:10:37.762 --> 03:10:38.722]  There are a few that aren't.
[03:10:38.922 --> 03:10:45.924]  Media Matters is on there, but again, if you go on Google and try and search for a Media Matters article, chances are it's going to pop up near the top.
[03:10:46.599 --> 03:10:52.021]  One's written by yours truly, aren't my own YouTube channels I was talking about in the previous segment.
[03:10:52.822 --> 03:10:56.863]  You can Google search Paul Joseph Watson YouTube channel.
[03:10:57.123 --> 03:11:11.569]  Not only does it not come up on the first page, I checked earlier, the link to my YouTube channel with the exact search term that you would expect to find it as the first result does not come up in the first 15 pages and beyond that.
[03:11:11.589 --> 03:11:13.630]  I didn't have time to check beyond that.
[03:11:13.930 --> 03:11:15.491]  It's probably not even on there at all.
[03:11:16.900 --> 03:11:27.293]  And now Gateway Pundit reports, if you search Google for prominent Conservative voices, including Mike Cernovich, Joe DiGenova, Jack Posobiec or Gateway Pundit, you will see hit pieces and biased attacks.
[03:11:27.313 --> 03:11:27.934]  This is the point.
[03:11:27.974 --> 03:11:31.258]  This is how they dictate, manipulate and create reality.
[03:11:31.799 --> 03:11:35.744]  The Gateway Pundit is one of the largest, most accurate, most influential publishers in the country today.
[03:11:36.781 --> 03:11:43.367]  But earlier this year, if you search Google for Gateway Pundit, the first item that popped up was a hit piece on the Gateway Pundit.
[03:11:43.807 --> 03:11:49.372]  You had to go to the fifth item before you could even find a link to their website.
[03:11:49.852 --> 03:11:56.898]  And they've got away better than I have because you don't even get my YouTube channel on the 15th page.
[03:11:57.479 --> 03:11:59.801]  Never mind the fifth rizzle on the first page.
[03:12:00.662 --> 03:12:02.263]  They have another headline here, frightening.
[03:12:03.328 --> 03:12:11.594]  Google Engineer leaks massive trove of info on Google's information control operations, reveals Google sent police and FBI to intimidate him.
[03:12:12.315 --> 03:12:14.997]  So again, he came out with some information back in June.
[03:12:15.517 --> 03:12:23.083]  They immediately clamped down on it, ferreted out his identity, and started intimidating him against releasing more information.
[03:12:23.123 --> 03:12:27.126]  But kudos to him, because he's released a huge treasure trove of documents.
[03:12:27.847 --> 03:12:30.409]  I think it's like a 90-page document, something around that.
[03:12:31.092 --> 03:12:36.753]  Proving, once again, that they do manipulate their search results for partisan purposes.
[03:12:36.793 --> 03:12:43.215]  Remember, Sundar Pichai got up in front of a Congressional hearing and said, quote, Complete and total BS!
[03:12:43.235 --> 03:12:47.176]  They were literally in there the days before the referendum on banning abortion in Ireland
[03:12:59.660 --> 03:13:08.984]  On their YouTube search engine, relegating, burying anti-abortion YouTube videos after one slight writer complained about it.
[03:13:09.344 --> 03:13:10.284]  This is how it works.
[03:13:10.684 --> 03:13:11.925]  This is the media now.
[03:13:12.405 --> 03:13:14.826]  Forget about journalism, forget about muckraking.
[03:13:15.146 --> 03:13:20.008]  Their entire purpose is to now simply de-platforming narratives that challenge them.
[03:13:20.488 --> 03:13:24.490]  One person complained to Google and they immediately fall into line
[03:13:25.345 --> 03:13:28.626]  Butcher their own search results so they're not even accurate anymore.
[03:13:29.006 --> 03:13:39.749]  Days before a referendum, which by the way went in the favour of the pro-abortion people in Ireland, burying anti-abortion YouTube videos.
[03:13:39.789 --> 03:13:42.449]  We've caught them doing this time and time again.
[03:13:43.730 --> 03:13:47.191]  Again, Mark Dice, you can put in the exact titles to his videos.
[03:13:48.071 --> 03:13:51.032]  Michelle Obama trashes Hillary Clinton was one example.
[03:13:51.692 --> 03:13:52.072]  Another,
[03:13:53.371 --> 03:13:58.933]  Mark Dice's video called Celebrities React to Hillary Losing Election had 6 million views.
[03:13:59.233 --> 03:14:09.316]  You put in the exact headline, it's buried beneath literally dozens of mainstream news outlets which have nothing whatsoever to do with that issue.
[03:14:09.336 --> 03:14:12.416]  I mean, this is really a crisis in democracy.
[03:14:12.476 --> 03:14:17.698]  This is way worse than $4,000 spent on Facebook ads by a bunch of Russians.
[03:14:18.365 --> 03:14:26.849]  And they've got the nerve to get up there in front of Congress and say they don't manipulate anything for partisan purposes when we've caught them doing it time and time again.
[03:14:27.309 --> 03:14:36.413]  They've got the nerve to put out headlines saying, oh Trump's considering a social media executive order based on unproven allegations of conservative bias.
[03:14:36.853 --> 03:14:40.235]  How many examples of this do we need to show you?
[03:14:40.595 --> 03:14:43.116]  How many times does Comedy Central or
[03:14:43.696 --> 03:14:49.858]  Stephen Colbert or any of these shows get to have their videos featured on YouTube trending, get to have ads in their videos.
[03:14:50.238 --> 03:14:53.539]  CNN can do a report about ISIS, it's chock full of ads.
[03:14:54.279 --> 03:14:57.160]  I do a report about anything, it's automatically demonetized.
[03:14:57.180 --> 03:15:02.562]  We have example after example of them manipulating their search engines.
[03:15:02.662 --> 03:15:06.603]  And again, this shifts millions and millions of votes on election day.
[03:15:07.563 --> 03:15:09.624]  And now we've had yet another example of that.
[03:15:10.367 --> 03:15:18.818]  When is this going to be presented in a master volume of evidence to actually push this executive social media order over the edge?
[03:15:19.118 --> 03:15:22.202]  Because they've been dragging their feet on it for the past six months.
[03:15:22.943 --> 03:15:24.105]  It's getting ever closer to 2020.
[03:15:25.490 --> 03:15:27.030]  And it's not looking good for Trump.
[03:15:27.090 --> 03:15:28.551]  This could definitely swing it.
[03:15:28.611 --> 03:15:33.412]  If you're talking about millions of votes on election day, this could definitely swing it against Trump.
[03:15:33.812 --> 03:15:37.914]  We need that social media executive order and we need it quick.
[03:15:38.214 --> 03:15:42.955]  Absolutely incredible that you can literally search the exact terms.
[03:15:43.305 --> 03:15:56.456]  The exact person, the exact YouTube channel, the exact news source you want, on the website, the number one search engine in the world that dictates, creates, directs reality, and it's completely buried.
[03:15:56.836 --> 03:16:00.619]  Yet we're still called liars for pointing that out by the media.
[03:16:00.759 --> 03:16:01.660]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:16:01.700 --> 03:16:02.220]  We'll be back.
[03:16:02.300 --> 03:16:02.721]  Hi.
[03:16:04.982 --> 03:16:09.006]  When you finance what we're doing, you're not just funding the second American revolution.
[03:16:10.390 --> 03:16:11.951]  You're changing world destiny.
[03:16:12.272 --> 03:16:16.855]  And there's so much fake stuff out there in a million different voices, and I understand that.
[03:16:16.915 --> 03:16:22.059]  But we really are in the zeitgeist, and we try to make it easy to get good products at the same time.
[03:16:22.139 --> 03:16:28.504]  But I can just tell you point blank, you cannot invest in a place better than InfoWars for human liberty and a pro-human future.
[03:16:28.564 --> 03:16:34.289]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[03:16:34.329 --> 03:16:36.791]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[03:16:36.991 --> 03:16:39.493]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[03:16:39.513 --> 03:16:42.435]  We have fish oil, children's fish oil, and ultimate krill oil.
[03:16:42.595 --> 03:16:43.736]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[03:16:44.076 --> 03:16:47.038]  And it is the strongest, purest fish oil, krill oil.
[03:16:47.098 --> 03:16:53.682]  And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[03:16:53.883 --> 03:16:59.586]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[03:16:59.626 --> 03:17:01.928]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[03:17:02.148 --> 03:17:02.889]  This has not been.
[03:17:03.189 --> 03:17:04.610]  We went to one of the top firms in the
[03:17:04.930 --> 03:17:05.410]  I think?
[03:17:24.381 --> 03:17:26.343]  And by the way, I'm not hyping this, folks.
[03:17:26.543 --> 03:17:29.285]  This is the best krill oil we could find.
[03:17:29.706 --> 03:17:30.506]  This is the best.
[03:17:30.586 --> 03:17:31.867]  I can't even just look at that.
[03:17:31.887 --> 03:17:34.830]  It's supposed to be red, folks, because that's the essence of the krill.
[03:17:34.850 --> 03:17:37.512]  I mean, there's probably like 100 krill going into each one of these.
[03:17:37.732 --> 03:17:41.215]  And again, I'm not going to call this a drug, because drugs are a ripoff of what God made.
[03:17:41.496 --> 03:17:43.958]  You take two of these before you go to bed at night.
[03:17:44.118 --> 03:17:46.139]  I would do it with your dinner if you don't want to get fish burps.
[03:17:46.159 --> 03:17:47.781]  Because again, I've got the fish oils of old.
[03:17:47.961 --> 03:17:50.523]  This doesn't have the fish flavor because they boiled the hell out of it.
[03:17:50.563 --> 03:17:52.084]  It isn't there anymore, folks.
[03:17:52.164 --> 03:17:53.465]  You gotta deal with the fish burps.
[03:17:53.725 --> 03:17:54.485]  This stuff's powerful.
[03:17:54.525 --> 03:17:55.286]  Just look at that.
[03:17:55.366 --> 03:17:57.507]  Can a camera pick up just how pretty those are?
[03:17:57.687 --> 03:17:59.208]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:18:04.207 --> 03:18:07.731]  Alex, I got a plug for the Patriot Points.
[03:18:08.071 --> 03:18:08.592]  I did.
[03:18:08.652 --> 03:18:11.996]  I got $180 so far this year in Patriot Points, and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[03:18:12.637 --> 03:18:15.700]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[03:18:15.760 --> 03:18:20.145]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in, so I'd rather give that money to
[03:18:20.245 --> 03:18:21.626]  Let me break this down for you.
[03:18:21.646 --> 03:18:23.048]  I've never really done marketing, but I did
[03:18:41.244 --> 03:18:45.607]  Bring in a few advertising people a few years ago who knew how to advertise online.
[03:18:45.627 --> 03:18:48.469]  And they said, Mr. Jones, they said, what's your markup?
[03:18:48.569 --> 03:18:49.070]  And I said, 150%.
[03:18:49.750 --> 03:18:50.711]  But we always discount 25%.
[03:18:51.011 --> 03:18:51.931]  So that's 100%.
[03:18:51.972 --> 03:18:53.352]  And they said, yeah.
[03:18:53.473 --> 03:18:54.693]  And then you're always discounting 20, 30%.
[03:18:54.833 --> 03:18:57.535]  And then we notice you only sell stuff when it's at 50%.
[03:18:58.476 --> 03:18:59.817]  And then you're barely making any money.
[03:18:59.997 --> 03:19:01.158]  You need to stop that.
[03:19:01.258 --> 03:19:04.261]  And they looked at our data and they said, oh, your audience would buy it if it was even more.
[03:19:04.281 --> 03:19:06.003]  And I said, I want high quality stuff in there.
[03:19:06.463 --> 03:19:07.264]  I want a good price.
[03:19:07.784 --> 03:19:13.449]  But I've kind of habituated everybody, trained everybody, myself done this, to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[03:19:13.629 --> 03:19:15.210]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off.
[03:19:15.811 --> 03:19:22.435]  Because there's no fillers, it's concentrated, it's got iodine, a little silver, and so it's the same thing like the fish oil, or the turmeric, or the bone broth.
[03:19:22.536 --> 03:19:29.040]  I mean, DNA Force, I signed a multi-year contract on that, which I was able to cut the price about 40% of what we were paying.
[03:19:29.160 --> 03:19:32.042]  It's still got 30-something dollars of product in it.
[03:19:32.142 --> 03:19:36.985]  I mean, you talk about cleaning your cells out, you talk about energy stamina, you talk about letting the telomeres last longer.
[03:19:37.105 --> 03:19:38.506]  This is patented to do that.
[03:19:38.666 --> 03:19:41.868]  And nobody puts this much of the real organic stuff in it.
[03:19:41.948 --> 03:19:43.850]  So yes, DNA Force is amazing.
[03:19:43.970 --> 03:19:44.910]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[03:19:44.930 --> 03:19:49.013]  But listen, when people get the Patriot Points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[03:19:49.133 --> 03:19:57.639]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, and then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot Points, we lose money.
[03:19:57.659 --> 03:19:58.239]  But that's okay.
[03:19:58.299 --> 03:19:58.900]  Thanks for the support.
[03:20:06.641 --> 03:20:09.384]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.553 --> 03:20:21.836]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:20:21.996 --> 03:20:23.717]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.018 --> 03:20:27.962]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:29.938 --> 03:20:32.619]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show, fourth hour.
[03:20:32.820 --> 03:20:54.931]  Before I get back into news, and by the way, I forgot to mention amidst all this social media censorship, because we had the story today, or last night, that YouTube actually took down the Cuomo Frido video, of course, where he gets irate, angry, threatens to kick someone in the teeth, threatens to throw them down the stairs, for calling him the Italian version of the N-word, even though it blatantly isn't.
[03:20:55.669 --> 03:20:57.169]  They took down that video!
[03:20:57.669 --> 03:21:01.270]  Only after Breitbart complained about it, did it go back up.
[03:21:01.310 --> 03:21:03.151]  They claimed it was bullying and harassment.
[03:21:03.211 --> 03:21:06.311]  Again, this video made Cuomo look bad.
[03:21:06.351 --> 03:21:10.112]  It wasn't... They didn't take it down because he was engaging in bullying and harassment.
[03:21:10.132 --> 03:21:13.013]  They took it down because it was going viral, it went viral.
[03:21:13.313 --> 03:21:16.353]  That's why they took it down, because it made the CNN host look bad.
[03:21:17.234 --> 03:21:23.295]  Only after Breitbart complained, put up an article about it, asked YouTube what they were doing, did it come back up.
[03:21:23.843 --> 03:21:25.184]  So it's like whack-a-mole.
[03:21:25.344 --> 03:21:34.107]  Every day you have to bitch and complain about this stuff and it prevents you from pushing an actual political message as we get nearer the election.
[03:21:34.227 --> 03:21:41.831]  So it just distracts you day after day after day to continually have to fight back against this time and time again.
[03:21:42.371 --> 03:21:46.973]  Which is why we need your support by getting the products right now at InfoWarsStore.com

[03:22:43.125 --> 03:22:44.586]  Forget about social media.
[03:22:45.546 --> 03:22:47.847]  We've been disappeared down the Google memory hole.
[03:22:47.887 --> 03:22:53.069]  You don't even come up on their search terms unless it's the mainstream media calling you a hateful bigot.
[03:22:54.029 --> 03:22:59.191]  But we are still here over a year after the bannerversary.

[03:23:16.803 --> 03:23:26.690]  Now, while the Social Media Executive Order remains stuck somewhere within the bowels of the White House, gun control is moving forward thanks to the Javanka presidency.
[03:23:26.751 --> 03:23:28.372]  Headline up at Information Liberation,
[03:23:29.051 --> 03:23:32.412]  Ivanka Trump quietly lobbying Congress for gun control.
[03:23:32.432 --> 03:23:34.292]  Because that's what's important, isn't it?
[03:23:34.912 --> 03:23:37.272]  That's not stabbing everyone who voted for Trump in the back.
[03:23:38.193 --> 03:23:41.833]  We voted for Donald Trump and got your Ivanka, writes Chris Menehan.
[03:23:43.253 --> 03:23:50.795]  Ivanka Trump is reportedly calling members of Congress to feel out various gun control proposals and to figure out what needs to be done in order to get them passed.
[03:23:51.355 --> 03:23:57.516]  Axios reports that Ivanka has been quietly calling lawmakers since the El Paso and Dayton massacres to gauge their openness
[03:23:58.211 --> 03:24:08.833]  The movement on gun legislation when Congress returns, perhaps she's showing them sad pictures, which is what she did to Trump before the bombing of Syria back in 2017.
[03:24:09.373 --> 03:24:21.375]  That's what's important to the Javanka presidency, not the fact that the father supporters being banned and censored off the Internet and persecuted at every term, but the fact that we need yet more gun control measures.
[03:24:21.415 --> 03:24:22.936]  Thanks a lot for that great work.
[03:24:23.336 --> 03:24:23.796]  Meanwhile,
[03:24:25.077 --> 03:24:29.638]  CNN's Anderson Cooper says it's exciting that whites will not be the majority in America.
[03:24:30.058 --> 03:24:32.079]  See, this is the problem time and time again.
[03:24:32.699 --> 03:24:45.023]  Every time there's a mass shooting blamed on a white supremacist, a right-wing extremist, they say that they've been radicalized because they believe in this giant conspiracy about the Great Replacement.
[03:24:45.363 --> 03:24:48.844]  This absolutely harebrained, ridiculous notion
[03:24:49.562 --> 03:24:52.843]  That white people in the West are in demographic decline.
[03:24:52.863 --> 03:24:55.023]  Because that's obviously not the case, isn't it?
[03:24:55.123 --> 03:24:57.124]  Not by every single metric imaginable.
[03:24:57.984 --> 03:25:03.386]  So it's bad if you talk about that and say it may have some negative consequences.
[03:25:03.426 --> 03:25:05.946]  That puts you in league with mass shooters and terrorists.
[03:25:06.567 --> 03:25:12.688]  But if you're CNN's Anderson Cooper and you talk about it and say it's a good thing, that's completely fine.
[03:25:13.448 --> 03:25:15.949]  CNN anchor Anderson Cooper seemed to celebrate
[03:25:16.474 --> 03:25:20.846]  The idea of white people no longer constituting the majority of those in the United States.
[03:25:21.889 --> 03:25:22.511]  He said, quote,
[03:25:23.536 --> 03:25:29.281]  The idea that, you know, whites will not be the majority, I mean, it's an exciting transformation of the country.
[03:25:29.601 --> 03:25:34.245]  It's an exciting evolution and, you know, progress of our country in many different ways.
[03:25:34.285 --> 03:25:45.015]  Imagine if he said that about Native Americans, or if he said it about black abortion rates, or if he said it about black people killing each other en masse in Chirac and places like that.
[03:25:45.475 --> 03:25:47.317]  He would be drummed out of a job.
[03:25:47.617 --> 03:25:51.000]  But as long as it's white people, the last acceptable form of racism,
[03:25:51.420 --> 03:25:54.082]  You can celebrate it and it's all fine and dandy.
[03:25:54.342 --> 03:26:02.647]  He made those comments while interviewing Univision anchor George Ramos, Jorge Ramos, who has openly advocated for more immigration policies.
[03:26:04.508 --> 03:26:11.832]  Ramos said there's nothing really they can do against this incredible demographic revolution and in 2044 everyone is going to be a minority.
[03:26:11.993 --> 03:26:14.214]  Great, Tower of Babel, see how that works out for you.
[03:26:14.994 --> 03:26:20.077]  And then I think President Trump represents those who are trying to revert that trend and he doesn't say it.
[03:26:20.498 --> 03:26:20.738]  Well,
[03:26:21.423 --> 03:26:30.109]  Trump just came out literally four days ago and said he wants millions more legal immigrants coming from non-white countries, so no, he's not really saying that, is he?
[03:26:30.829 --> 03:26:39.575]  Meanwhile, on the subject of radicalisation and violent rhetoric, which the left never disavows and encourages at every possible turn,
[03:26:41.209 --> 03:26:47.192]  Headline up on Infowars.com, ICE director blames political rhetoric for attack on San Antonio office.
[03:26:47.752 --> 03:27:06.341]  We've had yet another attempted violent attack on an ICE office just as we had the firebombing of an ICE facility in Washington State a few months ago, a few weeks ago, pardon me, by a self-admitted Antifa radical who openly in his own manifesto said he was radicalized by
[03:27:07.156 --> 03:27:14.700]  AOC's concentration camp rhetoric, that story was dropped within about three hours by all mainstream media outlets.
[03:27:15.481 --> 03:27:27.348]  And now after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office was hit with gunfire in San Antonio, the director of the office issued a statement blaming various politicians, media outlets and activist groups.
[03:27:28.334 --> 03:27:34.318]  Of course, now we know that most of the Democratic presidential candidates are running on a policy of abolishing ICE altogether.
[03:27:34.958 --> 03:27:44.044]  Many of them have openly encouraged the harassment, the doxing, even in some cases the harassment and doxing of ICE agents' children.
[03:27:44.644 --> 03:27:51.148]  So is it any great surprise that bullets are now flying towards ICE officers across the United States?
[03:27:52.393 --> 03:28:01.377]  FBI Special Agent Christopher Combs said, had the bullets gone two inches in another direction, we would be here talking about the murder of a federal official.
[03:28:02.337 --> 03:28:10.261]  But the field director at the office, Daniel Bible, seems more certain that the attack was deliberate, and he's blaming leftist ICE rhetoric.
[03:28:10.871 --> 03:28:17.094]  You know, it's misinformation about Alex's being recklessly disseminated by certain politicians and activists.
[03:28:17.694 --> 03:28:22.417]  So again, you've got this heightened political extremism on both sides, let's be fair.
[03:28:23.277 --> 03:28:29.780]  Difference is people on the right disavow it at every turn and encourage people not to engage in it.
[03:28:30.121 --> 03:28:30.901]  Meanwhile, you have
[03:28:31.639 --> 03:28:38.688]  Numerous members of Congress, numerous presidential candidates on the Democratic side saying go out and harass Trump supporters.
[03:28:39.088 --> 03:28:47.158]  Literally in the case of Reza Aslan saying that Trump supporters need to be eradicated, that Kellyanne Conway needs to be eradicated.
[03:28:47.560 --> 03:28:57.408]  So is it any great surprise that many of them are going jihad and now literally trying to attack government facilities but the media gives them cover and doesn't talk about it.
[03:28:57.428 --> 03:28:59.109]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:59.129 --> 03:29:00.430]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[03:29:00.690 --> 03:29:01.751]  Don't go away, we'll be back.
[03:29:05.454 --> 03:29:06.395]  InfoWars.
[03:29:09.619 --> 03:29:12.402]  The most banned network in the world.
[03:29:12.683 --> 03:29:15.827]  The British ended up being the most powerful empire in the world.
[03:29:15.947 --> 03:29:17.369]  Not because the Spanish couldn't fight.
[03:29:17.449 --> 03:29:18.991]  Not because the Portuguese couldn't fight.
[03:29:19.091 --> 03:29:21.614]  Not because the Austrian-Hungarian Empire couldn't fight.
[03:29:21.674 --> 03:29:23.877]  You ever wonder why British are called limeys?
[03:29:24.217 --> 03:29:26.560]  The British ended up getting basically key limes.
[03:29:27.481 --> 03:29:37.626]  When they went into the Caribbean 500 years ago, and they had their captains write and their ship's doctors how long sailors survived, what climates, they were trying to figure out what's making sickness.
[03:29:37.646 --> 03:29:40.787]  They weren't sure if it was hot air or why they got close to the shore.
[03:29:40.927 --> 03:29:42.628]  More of their sailors would die in a couple days.
[03:29:42.748 --> 03:29:44.509]  And they figured out pretty quick it was mosquitoes.
[03:29:44.649 --> 03:29:47.130]  But the British classified that 400 years ago.
[03:29:47.190 --> 03:29:48.971]  So the British would always lay off the coast.
[03:29:49.191 --> 03:29:51.852]  And foreigners would ask, why did the Brits lay off the coast?
[03:29:51.872 --> 03:29:52.672]  They don't want mosquitoes.
[03:29:52.893 --> 03:29:53.853]  And they get all the
[03:29:54.013 --> 03:29:56.294]  The fevers, the malaria that came with mosquitoes.
[03:29:56.534 --> 03:29:59.075]  The Brits also figured out with their scientists, limes.
[03:29:59.295 --> 03:30:00.916]  But the Brits were suspicious.
[03:30:00.956 --> 03:30:02.817]  The average sailor thought if you swim, you get sick.
[03:30:03.037 --> 03:30:05.378]  And they thought, you know, you don't want to eat vegetables, they make you sick.
[03:30:05.398 --> 03:30:07.159]  This is what people actually thought back then.
[03:30:07.999 --> 03:30:11.081]  So they would put the limes in the grog.
[03:30:11.641 --> 03:30:12.401]  Which is what's grog?
[03:30:12.541 --> 03:30:13.881]  One-third rum, two-thirds water.
[03:30:14.121 --> 03:30:15.482]  To make sure they would at least drink their water.
[03:30:15.522 --> 03:30:18.842]  Part of their pay, their daily ration for good behavior, was grog.
[03:30:19.062 --> 03:30:24.063]  So on the job, all sailors, Spanish, Russian, it didn't matter, they were paid in alcohol.
[03:30:24.203 --> 03:30:25.823]  And part of their daily food was alcohol.
[03:30:25.863 --> 03:30:31.024]  So the British would start putting, 400 years ago, limes in the alcohol, the grog.
[03:30:31.204 --> 03:30:36.985]  And so, what would happen when they were a thousand miles from home and ran up against a Spanish frigate twice their size?
[03:30:37.125 --> 03:30:39.186]  Well, the Spanish, all their teeth had fallen out.
[03:30:39.266 --> 03:30:40.526]  They had cuts all over them.
[03:30:40.726 --> 03:30:42.507]  Open wounds.
[03:30:42.687 --> 03:30:43.768]  No fresh vegetables.
[03:30:43.788 --> 03:30:57.498]  No vitamin C. Well, notice the British for 200 years could keep it secret that limes were... And so it was a joke to all the other armies that there were bags of limes and obsessions with limes and powdered lime powder to put in.
[03:30:57.778 --> 03:31:03.823]  And they would put it in the grog to make them drink it because they knew our troops are ready to fight.
[03:31:04.423 --> 03:31:07.584]  Because they've got vitamin C. So I'm going into a plug here, but here's the deal.
[03:31:07.784 --> 03:31:15.066]  Every study, Linus Pauling won two Nobel Prizes for vitamin C. And now if you have mega dosages of it, you basically never get cancer.
[03:31:15.086 --> 03:31:16.566]  So these are the things that are known.
[03:31:16.686 --> 03:31:20.368]  If you think vitamin C is powerful, the stuff at DNA Force is even beyond that.
[03:31:20.808 --> 03:31:21.848]  It's the next level of that.
[03:31:22.068 --> 03:31:22.829]  That's what we know.
[03:31:23.169 --> 03:31:27.572]  And when your body doesn't have the good halogen of iodine, it uses the bad halogen.
[03:31:27.732 --> 03:31:31.034]  And at a certain point, the cells are using toxic chemicals to survive.
[03:31:31.254 --> 03:31:37.358]  They start mutating so they can use that and not die, but then they take over your body and you die from cancer.
[03:31:37.498 --> 03:31:44.863]  And so, so much of the deformity and the mental illness and the low IQs and everything is that people have vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
[03:31:45.063 --> 03:31:47.187]  And they work around the clock with all these fake reports.
[03:31:47.207 --> 03:31:51.374]  Oh, you don't need vitamins, you don't need minerals, you don't need... And they lower the amount you're supposed to take.
[03:31:51.455 --> 03:31:54.380]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[03:32:02.975 --> 03:32:13.743]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[03:32:14.203 --> 03:32:17.846]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[03:32:18.326 --> 03:32:27.693]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[03:32:28.433 --> 03:32:29.954]  The system is vulnerable.
[03:32:30.455 --> 03:32:32.637]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[03:32:33.137 --> 03:32:36.220]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[03:32:36.780 --> 03:32:43.165]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[03:32:43.686 --> 03:32:49.050]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.

[03:33:22.794 --> 03:33:29.435]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:29.835 --> 03:33:34.836]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:36.156 --> 03:33:41.737]  Volkswagen Commercial banned in UK because it shows woman caring for a baby.
[03:33:42.298 --> 03:33:44.838]  This is the latest out of Clown World UK.
[03:33:45.618 --> 03:33:50.579]  It literally just shows a woman sat on a bench with a coffee next to a pram.
[03:33:51.235 --> 03:33:53.236]  This is unacceptable in 2019.
[03:33:53.516 --> 03:33:54.416]  This is where we're at.
[03:33:55.036 --> 03:33:56.837]  With gender stereotypes.
[03:33:57.557 --> 03:33:59.298]  The ASA has banned the ad.
[03:34:00.339 --> 03:34:03.200]  And it's in the Summit News article with that headline.
[03:34:04.080 --> 03:34:07.241]  The ad shows a scene of a woman and a man in a tent on a cliff face.
[03:34:08.081 --> 03:34:16.165]  Again, the implication there is that both the man and the woman have climbed this giant cliff, so that sounds quite like equality to me, doesn't it?
[03:34:17.265 --> 03:34:19.866]  But God forbid, listen to what they put in this ad.
[03:34:20.640 --> 03:34:23.762]  Two male astronauts floating in a spaceship.
[03:34:24.683 --> 03:34:28.165]  A male para-athlete with a prosthetic leg doing the long jump.
[03:34:29.446 --> 03:34:32.629]  Again, it's not a transgender disabled Muslim, so it's not allowed.
[03:34:33.069 --> 03:34:37.172]  At the end of the clip, a woman is seen sat on a bench next to a pram.
[03:34:37.822 --> 03:34:39.702]  God forbid the horror.
[03:34:40.103 --> 03:34:45.584]  The commercial was banned by the UK Advertising Standards Authority after just three people complained.
[03:34:46.024 --> 03:34:56.246]  Imagine being such a pathetic sack of crap that you get offended over a woman sat on a bench next to a pram and that's your life, is to complain about that.
[03:34:56.606 --> 03:34:59.087]  Imagine being that weasley of a person.
[03:35:01.067 --> 03:35:02.388]  The ASA said this.
[03:35:02.868 --> 03:35:03.668]  This is what they said.
[03:35:04.758 --> 03:35:12.282]  Because it's now against the law basically to have ads showing women doing laundry or women doing the washing up in the UK, seriously.
[03:35:12.722 --> 03:35:19.785]  You can show ads of men being complete idiots and failing at everything and falling over and being humiliated, that's fine.
[03:35:20.466 --> 03:35:25.488]  But the ASA said, quote, by juxtaposing images of men in extraordinary environments,
[03:35:26.295 --> 03:35:29.778]  Even though they did that with a woman who climbed the cliff face, they ignored that.
[03:35:30.198 --> 03:35:37.824]  In carrying out adventurous activities with women who appeared passive or engaged in a stereotypical caregiving role.
[03:35:37.844 --> 03:35:43.209]  Because we can't have young women being encouraged to give caregiving roles in society, can we?
[03:35:44.289 --> 03:35:45.731]  I mean, what's going to happen?
[03:35:47.032 --> 03:35:53.597]  We considered that the ad directly contrasted stereotypical male and female roles and characteristics in a manner that gave the impression
[03:35:54.338 --> 03:35:58.001]  That they were exclusively associated with one gender.
[03:35:58.541 --> 03:36:04.025]  He concluded that the ad presented gender stereotypes in a way that was likely to cause harm and therefore breach the code.
[03:36:04.545 --> 03:36:05.766]  Cause harm to who?
[03:36:06.087 --> 03:36:11.290]  The three sacks of crap who are so pathetic that this is their life to complain about things.
[03:36:12.631 --> 03:36:16.214]  The professionally offended, outraged, twitch fork mob.
[03:36:17.060 --> 03:36:21.622]  The only thing it harmed was their stupid feelings, which are like jelly and need to be harmed anyway.
[03:36:21.922 --> 03:36:23.543]  How on earth do they even get through a day?
[03:36:23.883 --> 03:36:31.186]  How on earth do they even operate in society if they have breakdowns, nervous breakdowns, over seeing a woman on a bench next to a pram?
[03:36:31.586 --> 03:36:34.047]  Why are we catering to these people in society?
[03:36:34.707 --> 03:36:36.088]  Why is society getting worse?
[03:36:36.448 --> 03:36:38.289]  Why is masculinity getting screwed up?
[03:36:39.089 --> 03:36:43.571]  The more we confuse stereotypical, normal in other words, gender roles.
[03:36:44.711 --> 03:36:45.932]  And what's funny about it is,
[03:36:47.122 --> 03:36:52.844]  Like, Volkswagen came back and tried to inject some sense into this, thinking that it would change anything.
[03:36:52.904 --> 03:36:54.085]  It's not going to change anything.
[03:36:54.385 --> 03:36:55.645]  Three people complained.
[03:36:55.985 --> 03:36:56.486]  It's over.
[03:36:56.726 --> 03:37:01.247]  They normally ban something after one person complains, so three, to them, is a deluge.
[03:37:01.868 --> 03:37:03.328]  Listen to what Volkswagen said.
[03:37:04.008 --> 03:37:13.392]  Defending... Oh, by the way, this is going to put, like, lots of female actresses out of work, now that they can't have parts showing them
[03:37:14.133 --> 03:37:15.014]  Performing care.
[03:37:15.274 --> 03:37:16.835]  Caregiving roles in society.
[03:37:16.855 --> 03:37:19.917]  That's going to eliminate a lot of jobs for female actresses.
[03:37:20.237 --> 03:37:20.758]  Well done!
[03:37:20.878 --> 03:37:21.779]  Yay feminism!
[03:37:22.039 --> 03:37:23.740]  Literally putting women out of work.
[03:37:24.641 --> 03:37:25.241]  Bravo!
[03:37:26.142 --> 03:37:33.147]  Volkswagen said, quote, The core message of the ad was centered on the ability of the human spirit to adapt to challenges.
[03:37:33.760 --> 03:37:35.762]  And change brought about by circumstances.
[03:37:36.262 --> 03:37:43.988]  They illustrated that through a number of different scenarios featuring various characters, so that as diverse an audience as possible would be able to identify with the message.
[03:37:45.009 --> 03:37:46.210]  So you've got a couple.
[03:37:46.230 --> 03:37:48.451]  It wasn't a mixed race couple.
[03:37:48.531 --> 03:37:50.633]  I mean, maybe they'll start banning that in the future.
[03:37:50.653 --> 03:37:52.394]  You can't have couples of the same race.
[03:37:53.555 --> 03:37:55.397]  They had a couple climbing a cliff face.
[03:37:56.334 --> 03:38:03.920]  They had a disabled man doing the long jump, they had some astronauts in a spaceship, they had a woman caring for a baby.
[03:38:04.481 --> 03:38:11.606]  So they tried to cover all the bases, but no, it's still bigoted, it's still wrong, and it will still be banned, because three idiots complained.
[03:38:13.428 --> 03:38:14.669]  Volkswagen went on to say...
[03:38:15.689 --> 03:38:28.814]  They included the final scene of the woman in the park as a relatable example of adaptation to change, as they believe that welcoming a newborn into the family was a life-changing experience that would be shared by many viewers, regardless of gender.
[03:38:29.234 --> 03:38:35.197]  No, you can't show positive portrayals of women caring for newborn babies.
[03:38:35.717 --> 03:38:37.418]  That is offensive!
[03:38:38.358 --> 03:38:43.640]  The scene served a secondary purpose of illustrating the reduction of engine noise in an electric vehicle.
[03:38:44.560 --> 03:38:51.383]  So basically this car drives past this woman who's starting a bench at high speed and the audio levels go down.
[03:38:51.423 --> 03:38:53.504]  They're illustrating that it's a quiet vehicle.
[03:38:54.245 --> 03:39:00.968]  Not that, God forbid, women do care for babies because we can't have young women seeing that message, can we?
[03:39:01.528 --> 03:39:06.270]  No, they all need to be out getting drunk and being completely degenerate and ruining their lives and being unhappy.
[03:39:06.490 --> 03:39:07.491]  That's what we need to push.
[03:39:09.850 --> 03:39:17.117]  Meanwhile, ads that reinforce negative gender stereotypes about men are still perfectly fine, which brings me back to the manspreading.
[03:39:18.198 --> 03:39:28.469]  Of course, we had the media a couple of weeks ago celebrate the designer of the anti-manspreading chair, which was completely ridiculous, looked aesthetically hideous and would never be produced.
[03:39:28.549 --> 03:39:29.410]  It was just a social
[03:39:30.406 --> 03:39:33.787]  Justice identity politics stunt, but the media treated it seriously.
[03:39:34.367 --> 03:39:42.229]  So why can't we have ads showing women caring for the babies because it reinforces harmful gender stereotypes and might offend people?
[03:39:42.649 --> 03:39:48.231]  But we can have ads, giant ads on the London Underground lecturing men how to sit.
[03:39:49.731 --> 03:39:54.032]  And the image is right there in the article, you can see it up on screen now.
[03:39:54.912 --> 03:39:56.213]  That's not how you sit!
[03:39:56.253 --> 03:39:57.013]  Sit properly!
[03:39:57.873 --> 03:39:59.614]  Who the hell sits like this?
[03:39:59.955 --> 03:40:02.316]  Have you ever seen anyone on public transport?
[03:40:02.656 --> 03:40:09.982]  This is not even physically, anatomically possible to sit like that with your legs spread out over two people sat next to you.
[03:40:10.462 --> 03:40:13.624]  Oh, and by the way, let's talk about bag spreading.
[03:40:14.105 --> 03:40:15.926]  No, we never seem to talk about that, do we?
[03:40:17.147 --> 03:40:22.050]  And I flashed back in this article to another article, which is from back in April.
[03:40:22.651 --> 03:40:25.713]  Ads for homophobic Brunei appear on London Underground.
[03:40:26.133 --> 03:40:27.394]  Bikini ads banned.
[03:40:28.004 --> 03:40:32.246]  You remember back in 2015, we had the big controversy over Protein World.
[03:40:33.067 --> 03:40:40.690]  They had a billboard campaign showing an attractive woman, who's obviously physically healthy, in good condition, wearing a bikini.
[03:40:41.111 --> 03:40:46.433]  A bunch of fat, ugly feminists complained about it and defaced it, so it was banned.
[03:40:47.334 --> 03:40:55.818]  But, if you want to have an ad for the homophobic nation of Brunei, which tried to pass a law literally allowing gay people to be stoned to death,
[03:40:56.972 --> 03:41:01.393]  That ad was perfectly acceptable on the London Underground.
[03:41:01.793 --> 03:41:03.273]  We had another example of this.
[03:41:04.414 --> 03:41:09.775]  Headline, UK ad featuring sexy female mechanic banned after a single complaint.
[03:41:10.435 --> 03:41:22.698]  Again, just takes one permanently professionally outraged moron to change the nature of society because now our institutions are catering to their mental illnesses.
[03:41:23.453 --> 03:41:33.842]  An ad for a Porsche garage in the UK featuring a sexy female mechanic was banned by the ASA after a single complaint because it was sexually suggested.
[03:41:34.402 --> 03:41:46.893]  So where to understand now that they've banned an ad showing a woman caring for a baby and also banned an ad showing a woman working under a car doing mechanics that you can't show a woman engaging in a
[03:41:47.677 --> 03:42:05.105]  Stereotypically feminine role and you can't show a woman engaging in a stereotypically masculine role, again, putting a whole swath of female actresses and people who appear in ad campaigns out of work, literally depriving them of income.
[03:42:05.625 --> 03:42:08.206]  That's feminism in 2019.
[03:42:08.646 --> 03:42:09.146]  Well done.
[03:42:09.547 --> 03:42:10.147]  Bravo.
[03:42:10.547 --> 03:42:12.048]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[03:42:12.548 --> 03:42:14.709]  Talking about degeneracy, here's another headline.
[03:42:15.743 --> 03:42:19.386]  New Universal Movie portrays sixth graders playing with sex toys.
[03:42:20.387 --> 03:42:31.235]  In the trailer for this, they literally have Seth Rogen at the start telling the child actors in this movie that they can't watch the trailer because it's, quote, too messed up for kids your age.
[03:42:31.676 --> 03:42:40.983]  The first scene in the trailer from the actual movie portrays these 11, 12-year-old boys playing with a gimp mask, dildos, and anal beads.
[03:42:41.944 --> 03:42:42.924]  And it goes on from there.
[03:42:42.964 --> 03:42:43.745]  They literally have them
[03:42:44.304 --> 03:42:47.265]  Transporting ecstasy to playgrounds and stuff like that.
[03:42:47.745 --> 03:42:51.246]  This movie is aimed at a pre-teen audience.
[03:42:52.986 --> 03:42:57.867]  Someone on Twitter joked, I think this was supposed to be the in-flight movie on Epstein's plane.
[03:42:58.187 --> 03:42:59.728]  Absolutely absurd.
[03:43:00.108 --> 03:43:00.708]  Don't go away.
[03:43:00.728 --> 03:43:01.368]  We'll be back.
[03:43:02.208 --> 03:43:07.170]  Let's go to James at Massachusetts.
[03:43:07.530 --> 03:43:08.170]  James, you're on the air.
[03:43:08.210 --> 03:43:08.750]  Thanks for calling.
[03:43:10.487 --> 03:43:11.468]  Hello, Alex.
[03:43:11.708 --> 03:43:13.569]  God bless General Jones.
[03:43:13.629 --> 03:43:15.810]  May you live in peace and love forever.
[03:43:15.870 --> 03:43:16.910]  In Christ's name we pray.
[03:43:17.031 --> 03:43:17.771]  God bless you, brother.
[03:43:18.011 --> 03:43:19.272]  And I'd like to thank you also.
[03:43:19.292 --> 03:43:22.613]  You know, my wife and I have been married for 17 years, and we were never able to have kids.
[03:43:22.713 --> 03:43:31.838]  And after a couple years of taking the B12 and the iodine, and knowing about not using fluoride and not having vaccines, we have a great, healthy, vibrant six-year-old boy.
[03:43:31.958 --> 03:43:33.199]  And I thank you very much for that.
[03:43:33.319 --> 03:43:36.000]  Well, you know, fluoride is meant to block fertility.
[03:43:36.460 --> 03:43:39.440]  It's the bad halogen, but iodine is associated with fertility.
[03:43:39.900 --> 03:43:41.000]  So that's a beautiful story.
[03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:42.041]  That's exciting, my friend.
[03:43:42.181 --> 03:43:46.401]  And I've got all the articles right here about IQ, fertility, being boosted on iodine.
[03:43:46.962 --> 03:43:47.402]  You name it.
[03:43:47.662 --> 03:43:51.722]  That's why the system fights to keep people from getting good iodine and other things that we talk about here.
[03:43:51.782 --> 03:43:54.023]  Even though I get it from InfoWarsTore.com, it doesn't matter to me.
[03:43:54.083 --> 03:43:56.363]  Just research what deficiencies are doing.
[03:43:56.503 --> 03:43:59.644]  But get back to you and your wife and recap the story you were telling.
[03:43:59.844 --> 03:44:23.333]  So we've been married for 17 years and we never had any children and we bought the water filter first and we got out the fluoride and the glyphosate and then we started taking X2 and B12 and about a year or so later my wife got pregnant with our baby boy and with the iodine that she was taking and everything he's so bright and you can just see the glow in his face and he's always smiling and we just owe it all to you and you're our hero Alex.
[03:44:23.533 --> 03:44:24.855]  Well, that's just beautiful, brother.
[03:44:25.155 --> 03:44:28.298]  And again, it shows the system knows all this.
[03:44:28.639 --> 03:44:32.984]  And it works to keep the people from just getting basic things the body has to have.
[03:44:33.024 --> 03:44:35.587]  You have to have vitamin C. You have to have iodine.
[03:44:35.907 --> 03:44:36.768]  You have to have water.
[03:44:37.088 --> 03:44:38.070]  You have to have oxygen.
[03:44:38.490 --> 03:44:40.811]  Instead, the whole system works to block that.
[03:44:40.951 --> 03:44:41.992]  It's just so powerful.
[03:44:42.072 --> 03:44:43.153]  It's what we're made of.
[03:44:43.273 --> 03:44:45.554]  And I'm sitting here trying to explain this to people.
[03:44:45.574 --> 03:44:46.955]  We're not just making this stuff up.
[03:44:47.155 --> 03:44:48.235]  It's just everything.
[03:44:48.275 --> 03:44:50.156]  But again, the other iodines are bound.
[03:44:50.176 --> 03:44:51.277]  You don't absorb them.
[03:44:51.737 --> 03:44:53.158]  Everyone calls their iodine atomic.
[03:44:53.398 --> 03:44:55.819]  I wish everyone else was selling atomic iodine.
[03:44:55.919 --> 03:44:56.300]  They're not.
[03:44:56.480 --> 03:44:58.141]  Implowarestore.com or AAA2533139.
[03:45:04.699 --> 03:45:09.140]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:45:09.380 --> 03:45:14.001]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:45:14.021 --> 03:45:20.522]  And they said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[03:45:20.922 --> 03:45:33.524]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:45:34.284 --> 03:45:42.990]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:45:43.011 --> 03:45:44.872]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[03:45:45.212 --> 03:45:46.373]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[03:45:46.393 --> 03:45:47.654]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[03:45:47.814 --> 03:45:49.015]  He doesn't drink anything.
[03:45:49.215 --> 03:45:50.695]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[03:45:51.216 --> 03:45:52.836]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[03:45:53.156 --> 03:45:54.617]  I only have to take one knockout.
[03:45:54.977 --> 03:45:57.578]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[03:45:57.618 --> 03:45:58.478]  This is insane.
[03:45:58.898 --> 03:46:00.519]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[03:46:00.759 --> 03:46:03.319]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[03:46:03.760 --> 03:46:05.280]  He says, this is totally free.
[03:46:05.320 --> 03:46:07.141]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[03:46:07.161 --> 03:46:09.021]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[03:46:09.882 --> 03:46:15.803]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[03:46:16.063 --> 03:46:17.404]  All just moderate dose.
[03:46:18.936 --> 03:46:26.928]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[03:46:26.948 --> 03:46:29.352]  So, that's available infullwarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:29.372 --> 03:46:30.534]  But thank you for committing.
[03:46:34.597 --> 03:46:37.419]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[03:46:37.799 --> 03:46:40.401]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[03:46:40.421 --> 03:46:45.184]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[03:46:45.644 --> 03:46:51.788]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[03:46:51.808 --> 03:46:54.910]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[03:46:55.270 --> 03:46:56.571]  It's called reap what you sow.
[03:47:06.112 --> 03:47:08.834]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:18.081 --> 03:47:20.283]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.

[03:47:26.668 --> 03:47:30.391]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.

[03:47:35.559 --> 03:47:38.120]  War Room is coming up in the next hour.

[03:48:51.943 --> 03:48:53.744]  Took a vacation last week.
[03:48:54.044 --> 03:49:01.969]  CNN put out an article saying every time a Fox News host takes a vacation, it's actually a disguise for a suspension.
[03:49:02.489 --> 03:49:04.410]  They go through a list of different examples.
[03:49:04.450 --> 03:49:10.273]  Laura Ingraham, Judge Jeanine Sean Hannity, Jesse Watters and Bill O'Reilly, of course, never returned.
[03:49:10.994 --> 03:49:18.918]  They all went on vacation at the same time that they were embroiled with controversy for what they said on air during their Fox News show.
[03:49:19.887 --> 03:49:26.230]  And now some people are speculating that Tucker Carlson's sudden vacation was actually a suspension.
[03:49:26.851 --> 03:49:39.297]  Fox News claims that it was planned well in advance, but CNN tried to talk to numerous high profile people at Fox News to get a comment on whether it was a vacation or a suspension, and none of them agreed to talk.
[03:49:39.837 --> 03:49:43.959]  So that still rages as to whether Tucker Carlson has been suspended or not.
[03:49:43.979 --> 03:49:48.602]  He is slated to come back on August 19th, which I expect that to happen.
[03:49:49.281 --> 03:50:00.129]  Others speculating that his preeminent slot at the primetime Fox News slot will be replaced, or at least supplemented, with Ben Shapiro.
[03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:03.851]  That is an outcome, an eventuality, that nobody wants to see.
[03:50:03.871 --> 03:50:08.995]  The response on Twitter to that possibility has been vehemently, no.
[03:50:09.896 --> 03:50:15.079]  Meanwhile, Epstein's guards falsified records to say they had checked on him.
[03:50:15.099 --> 03:50:18.722]  Because what happened with the deplatform, with the censorship, was that
[03:50:19.304 --> 03:50:27.287]  They started removing Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy videos, which would have meant removing basically thousands of videos over the past two days.
[03:50:27.347 --> 03:50:33.829]  I think they only removed one prominent video of people questioning if it really was a suicide.
[03:50:33.869 --> 03:50:37.590]  And the latest explanation as to why Epstein's suicide was not prevented
[03:50:38.562 --> 03:50:45.247]  Is that his guards were asleep for the three hours before it happened and later falsified records to make it look as if they had checked on Epstein.
[03:50:45.267 --> 03:50:53.693]  So they're running still with this incompetence theory despite the fact that he was obviously probably the highest profile prisoner that they had ever had.
[03:50:54.514 --> 03:51:03.420]  The guards were asleep for hours before and they filled in the logbook to make it look as if they had been checking on Epstein every 30 minutes.
[03:51:04.517 --> 03:51:09.820]  Of course, yesterday it emerged that Epstein allegedly hanged himself using bed sheets.
[03:51:10.241 --> 03:51:20.907]  Those very same bed sheets were described as not being much stronger than paper by a former inmate, but apparently he managed to hang himself from a bunk bed using bed sheets not much stronger than paper.
[03:51:22.548 --> 03:51:29.933]  Zero Hedge asks, ladies and gentlemen, have we found our patsies in relation to these incompetent jail guards?
[03:51:30.695 --> 03:51:40.160]  As we reported yesterday, shrieking and shouting was heard from Jeffrey Epstein's cell the morning he died, while one of Epstein's guards at the MCC was not a regular corrections officer.
[03:51:40.800 --> 03:51:48.184]  Also, Epstein's cellmate had been mysteriously removed the night before, meaning there was no one to witness his suicide.
[03:51:48.544 --> 03:51:53.767]  And of course, the cameras didn't pick up anything just by coincidence.
[03:51:55.060 --> 03:52:01.802]  Meanwhile, oh by the way everyone's basically forgotten about Epstein now, it's out of the news cycle already, that's what happens within three days, it's totally gone.
[03:52:02.683 --> 03:52:12.946]  Meanwhile in London, Noel Gallagher of Oasis reveals plans to leave London after a man was stabbed on his street and admits he doesn't want his children growing up in the capital.
[03:52:13.507 --> 03:52:23.230]  So even though Noel Gallagher lives in one of the most expensive areas of London, he makes the point that he's got huge housing estates either side of where he lives and because
[03:52:24.048 --> 03:52:26.951]  The gang members in those housing estates are at war with each other.
[03:52:27.331 --> 03:52:31.234]  Innocent people are now being stabbed, which I can certainly sympathise with.
[03:52:31.795 --> 03:52:36.319]  Literally five minutes from where I live, five minutes walk, people are being stabbed.
[03:52:36.379 --> 03:52:44.106]  And now it's not just gang on gang, it's innocent people, some of whom try to intervene in some of this carnage and end up becoming the victims.
[03:52:44.526 --> 03:52:49.831]  Well, now Noel Gallagher has revealed he's leaving London after a man was recently stabbed on his street.
[03:52:50.680 --> 03:52:56.323]  The former Oasis rocker opened up on his relocation plans after declaring the city is too dangerous to raise his family in.
[03:52:57.023 --> 03:53:14.351]  Of course, Liam Gallagher said words to the same effect a few years, a few weeks ago, sorry, questioning why Sadiq Khan always replies to this knife crime wave, this acid attack wave in London, by simply saying London is open as it continues to get worse.
[03:53:14.831 --> 03:53:18.713]  Of course, exacerbated by numerous factors which they will never talk about,
[03:53:19.463 --> 03:53:40.454]  Drill rap music being prime amongst them and the increasing violence on our streets thanks to mass immigration because a lot of these gang members are coming in from places like the Congo and Somalia and the gang members already in the UK are having to up their levels of violence simply to compete, simply to remain, to retain their turf.
[03:53:40.954 --> 03:53:46.177]  Nobody talks about mass immigration contributing, exacerbating this huge problem.
[03:53:47.094 --> 03:53:52.984]  And now Noel Gallagher has said that he is leaving London and I'll probably be soon to follow him.
[03:53:53.945 --> 03:54:01.197]  Meanwhile over in Germany, former three-star general says Merkel can't even bring herself to say German people.
[03:54:01.846 --> 03:54:04.507]  Which reminded me of the incident a few years ago.
[03:54:04.527 --> 03:54:10.068]  You remember when Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, was up on stage celebrating an election victory.
[03:54:10.528 --> 03:54:14.349]  She was handed a small German flag to wave in celebration.
[03:54:14.930 --> 03:54:16.030]  She looked embarrassed.
[03:54:16.110 --> 03:54:16.990]  She shook her head.
[03:54:17.350 --> 03:54:20.111]  She disposed of that flag very quickly.
[03:54:22.152 --> 03:54:30.614]  And now former three-star general Joachim Wundrach says that Angela Merkel is so politically correct she cannot even bring herself to talk about, quote, the German people.
[03:54:31.781 --> 03:54:46.826]  He has announced recently that he's going to run for the Mayor of Hanover as a member of the AFD, slammed Merkel for being the front person for enacting, quote, anti-German, pro-mass migration policies and refusing to even acknowledge the existence of German people as a group.
[03:54:47.667 --> 03:54:48.287]  He said, quote,
[03:54:48.965 --> 03:54:53.247]  Merkel has sworn an oath to Germany, but she already has a problem talking about German people.
[03:54:53.627 --> 03:54:55.648]  She prefers to speak of population.
[03:54:56.028 --> 03:55:04.652]  Many German politicians struggle to profess their own nation, so she daren't even say the words the German people anymore.
[03:55:05.569 --> 03:55:12.353]  Meanwhile, Voice of Europe reports Germany multiple women sexually assaulted senior citizen beaten all by migrant men.
[03:55:12.934 --> 03:55:16.136]  This happened over the weekend in Germany where three women were sexually assaulted.
[03:55:16.176 --> 03:55:19.098]  A senior citizen was sent to the hospital after she was beaten.
[03:55:19.718 --> 03:55:24.341]  Two Afghan migrants have been arrested while the other three suspects remain at large.
[03:55:25.362 --> 03:55:33.167]  Of course, Germany is now inundated by commercials and they even weave the storylines into the narratives of soap operas
[03:55:34.716 --> 03:55:49.043]  Trying to get them to accept this new reality, even though from the German government's own numbers, violent crime continues to increase and the majority of it is being committed by these culturally enriching migrants.
[03:55:50.524 --> 03:55:50.924]  Italy.
[03:55:51.164 --> 03:55:55.187]  Animal cruelty investigation after Muslim migrants slaughter sheep in parking lot.
[03:55:56.187 --> 03:56:03.651]  A pair of Tunisian migrants are under investigation by Italian authorities for animal cruelty after allegedly slaughtering sheep in a parking lot.
[03:56:04.420 --> 03:56:12.604]  This happened at the village of Bentiboglio in Bologna as part of the annual Islamic festival, Sacrifice Eid, but was observed by a local security guard.
[03:56:13.044 --> 03:56:17.666]  We see these stories all across Europe where they just randomly start slaughtering animals in the street.
[03:56:18.186 --> 03:56:20.447]  Again, diversity is a strength.
[03:56:22.168 --> 03:56:25.890]  Refugees charged with planning Islamic extremist attack in Merkel's Germany.
[03:56:25.990 --> 03:56:28.191]  This basically happens every Christmas at this point.
[03:56:28.231 --> 03:56:28.651]  Remember the
[03:56:29.392 --> 03:56:33.634]  Truck attack back in, I think it was December 2016 in Berlin.
[03:56:34.054 --> 03:56:40.276]  Well now German federal prosecutors say they've charged the three Iraqi refugees with planning an Islamic extremist bombing.
[03:56:41.256 --> 03:56:46.878]  That is happening in Germany, as Angela Merkel literally is afraid to use the term the German people.
[03:56:48.119 --> 03:56:51.540]  Illegal migrant Uber Eats delivery man arrested for rape.
[03:56:52.080 --> 03:56:53.881]  That happened in Bordeaux, France.
[03:56:54.699 --> 03:56:59.905]  Meanwhile in Sweden, a journalist smuggles migrant into Sweden, migrant convicted of knife crime.
[03:57:00.285 --> 03:57:06.852]  A Syrian migrant smuggled into Sweden by a journalist working for Sweden's national broadcaster has been sentenced in court for knife crimes.
[03:57:07.353 --> 03:57:10.997]  Sweden continues to struggle with soaring violent crime and rape rates.
[03:57:12.085 --> 03:57:29.684]  Yeah, they literally have intelligence agencies working with the Swedish government naming myself and the angry foreigner who is a Bosnian immigrant YouTuber blaming us for this perceived rise in migrant crime simply for making YouTube videos drawing attention to it.
[03:57:30.399 --> 03:57:38.924]  And in fact, last week the angry foreigner had his channel on the verge of deletion because they'd falsely flagged two of his videos for hate speech.
[03:57:39.405 --> 03:57:46.669]  This is a very mild-mannered, moderate person simply drawing attention to the problems related to mass migration in Sweden.
[03:57:47.229 --> 03:57:48.330]  That's gonna wrap it up for the show.
[03:57:48.350 --> 03:57:49.391]  War Room is coming up next.
[03:57:49.451 --> 03:57:51.072]  BreakingNewsInfoWars.com.
[03:57:51.272 --> 03:57:52.833]  Don't go away.
[03:57:55.054 --> 03:57:59.077]  When you finance what we're doing, you're not just funding the Second American Revolution.
[03:58:00.458 --> 03:58:02.019]  You're changing world destiny.
[03:58:02.360 --> 03:58:06.483]  And there's so much fake stuff out there in a million different voices, and I understand that.
[03:58:06.983 --> 03:58:12.127]  But we really are in the zeitgeist, and we try to make it easy to get good products at the same time.
[03:58:12.207 --> 03:58:18.572]  But I can just tell you point blank, you cannot invest in a place better than InfoWars for human liberty and a pro-human future.
[03:58:18.632 --> 03:58:24.357]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[03:58:24.397 --> 03:58:26.859]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[03:58:27.059 --> 03:58:29.561]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[03:58:29.581 --> 03:58:32.504]  We have fish oil, children's fish oil, and ultimate krill oil.
[03:58:32.644 --> 03:58:33.825]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[03:58:34.166 --> 03:58:37.108]  And it is the strongest, purest fish oil, krill oil.
[03:58:37.168 --> 03:58:43.754]  And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[03:58:43.955 --> 03:58:49.660]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[03:58:49.700 --> 03:58:51.942]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[03:58:52.222 --> 03:58:52.843]  This has not been.
[03:58:53.243 --> 03:58:59.590]  We went to one of the top firms in the world that private labels fish oil and krill oil and we said we want the best you make.
