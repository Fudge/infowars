[00:00:13.894 --> 00:00:16.816]  Welcome on this Tuesday, November the 26th, 2019.
[00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:17.817]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:17.837 --> 00:00:18.617]  I'll be your host today.
[00:00:18.757 --> 00:00:20.739]  Alex Jones will be joining us with some reports.
[00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:28.644]  And of course, up on InfoWars, we have a breaking report that Facebook has secretly built.
[00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:29.185]  How about that?
[00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:32.507]  Secretly built facial recognition app four years ago.
[00:00:33.573 --> 00:00:34.996]  We've been telling you that this is happening.
[00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:37.420]  We've been telling you longer than that.
[00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:43.671]  What is going on with the social media companies that are working hand in glove?
[00:00:44.417 --> 00:00:45.658]  With the intelligence community.
[00:00:46.538 --> 00:00:53.301]  Geospatial intelligence, biometric identification, that is the fastest growing aspect of intelligence.
[00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:55.701]  And it is inwardly directed.
[00:00:55.982 --> 00:01:04.845]  These agencies that have been used to overthrow governments, to create regime change, coups and so forth, are now being turned on the American people.
[00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:10.107]  The social media giant has now tested, admit, they're telling us that they've taken it out.
[00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:11.408]  So you don't have to worry about that, right?
[00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:17.914]  A social media giant tested a facial recognition app on its employees using real-time facial recognition.
[00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:22.598]  The firm was able to identify a person by pointing a smartphone app at them.
[00:01:22.638 --> 00:01:29.185]  The technology was capable of bringing up someone's Facebook profile who had enabled facial recognition on their profiles.
[00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:30.826]  I just saw a video last night.
[00:01:30.846 --> 00:01:35.010]  I don't know how old it was, but it was a classroom in China.
[00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.114]  And as the kids walked in, they had a giant screen at the front and it showed each of their, recognized their faces and put up their IDs.
[00:01:45.214 --> 00:01:46.255]  They were so excited!
[00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:48.235]  I mean, it's a, you know, hey, look at that.
[00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:49.176]  I'm somebody.
[00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:50.816]  I'm on a TV screen.
[00:01:51.537 --> 00:01:52.997]  And of course, they've been selling this to people.
[00:01:53.037 --> 00:01:54.838]  That was the whole basis of social media.
[00:01:55.238 --> 00:01:57.579]  You could somehow be a reality TV star.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.922]  And yet, do you think it's a surprise that an organization that called itself Facebook
[00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:08.983]  Uh, would be grabbing your face and using that to create a database for facial recognition.
[00:02:09.023 --> 00:02:14.925]  And of course, if they're not, that information can be scraped off by all the different government organizations.
[00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:16.666]  I mean, it's absolutely not a problem.
[00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:17.726]  It's public.
[00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:21.107]  They can scrape that information off and use it themselves.
[00:02:21.147 --> 00:02:31.350]  This information was first revealed by Business Insider, who cited anonymous sources who said the app was developed between 2015 and 2016, but of course has now been shut down.
[00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.650]  They're so sorry that you found out.
[00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:38.175]  They're not going to be stealing, lying to you anymore, or tracking you everywhere you go.
[00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:41.297]  That's something that was the old Facebook.
[00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:44.360]  The new and improved Facebook will not be doing that, of course.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.724]  Instead, what they'll be doing is banning all content about vaccine awareness.
[00:02:49.905 --> 00:02:51.306]  Yeah, that's the other aspect of that.
[00:02:51.626 --> 00:02:57.552]  Mike Adams, Natural News, talking about the fact that you have Monica Bickert, Facebook's Vice President.
[00:02:58.425 --> 00:03:08.549]  Global policy management said the social media network will reduce the distribution of anything they determine to be false and provide users with authoritative information about vaccinations.
[00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:12.870]  What other health information are they going to withhold from us?
[00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:16.872]  As Mike Adams asked, is it going to be infanticide?
[00:03:17.852 --> 00:03:18.853]  Killing of human infants?
[00:03:19.213 --> 00:03:20.713]  Will that be hate speech against women?
[00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.694]  Of course we've seen that already, right?
[00:03:23.194 --> 00:03:25.095]  So here's a conundrum for Facebook.
[00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:29.732]  We now have ABC News, one of the checkmark media.
[00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:31.776]  You know they get that checkmark from NewsGuard?
[00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:35.525]  Of course they get the, I also call them the checkbook media.
[00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:44.200]  But one of these big media companies, ABC News, with connections to the Clintons, they still are probably in the good graces of even Buckingham Palace.
[00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:53.806]  They're now telling us more polio cases are being caused by vaccines than by the wild virus in Africa.
[00:03:54.286 --> 00:03:55.046]  What a surprise!
[00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:57.308]  We've been telling you this for a long time.
[00:03:58.482 --> 00:04:01.804]  And yet now we have ABC News admitting this.
[00:04:02.464 --> 00:04:08.168]  This is actually coming out of a report from the World Health Organization reported by ABC News.
[00:04:08.988 --> 00:04:10.970]  Part of the checkmark checkbook media.
[00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.132]  The United States is supposed to be the leader of the free world.
[00:04:16.253 --> 00:04:19.375]  But the United States has been failing the test.
[00:04:21.158 --> 00:04:28.780]  Big Tech in the last 20 years has been given total carte blanche to engage in any type of criminal activity they wish.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.280]  They're allowed to surveil.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.501]  They're allowed to sell the data illegally.
[00:04:34.521 --> 00:04:40.882]  They're allowed to game systems and inflate viewership or deflate viewership numbers.
[00:04:42.062 --> 00:04:45.903]  Any fraud you can imagine, Big Tech's been involved with it.
[00:04:47.003 --> 00:04:50.124]  I remember 15 years ago, major travel sites that came out.
[00:04:51.462 --> 00:04:55.984]  We're tracking users and building profiles and they thought they could rip you off.
[00:04:56.044 --> 00:04:59.286]  They were over charging you what they would charge other people.
[00:05:00.326 --> 00:05:05.168]  The sky is the limit to what these groups have done and will do.
[00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.511]  Now, as soon as Hillary Clinton lost, I knew what was about to happen.
[00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.553]  The same thing that was going to happen if she'd won.
[00:05:15.455 --> 00:05:25.801]  The globalists were moving forward with their expansion and they were getting ready with the dying dinosaur media to try to end competition and bring in the next level of censorship.
[00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:34.727]  And the pliant mainstream media was basically like a cancer victim about to die at hospice.
[00:05:35.827 --> 00:05:41.571]  And big tech was the hospice managers delivering the lethal dosages of morphine.
[00:05:42.557 --> 00:05:43.678]  In fact, that's a great analogy.
[00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:44.838]  It comes from Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:57.545]  He said mainstream news, corporate media, network television, the newspapers, they're going to come to us for help and we're going to hold their hand like a cancer patient at hospice while they die.
[00:05:58.606 --> 00:06:04.669]  And so big tech's using the corporate media and its death throes caused by the competition of an open free internet.
[00:06:06.195 --> 00:06:24.579]  In their final act to shut down their competition and murder what's left of journalism, free speech, and the first amendment in some vain hope that it will put them back in a power position of being pertinent and mattering again and having power.
[00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:28.160]  Staying relevant, but that's not going to happen.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.180]  And so now for the big news.
[00:06:31.906 --> 00:06:43.810]  As they complete the takeover of the Internet, it's going to expand way past political activity to consumer reviews, consumer reports, and consumer activism.
[00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.051]  That's always been the big target when they want to bring down free speech.
[00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:52.653]  They started out demonizing me heavily about four years ago.
[00:06:53.615 --> 00:06:56.997]  Well now, in the final days of 2019, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Apple,
[00:07:16.178 --> 00:07:28.185]  Are all announcing that they will allow no criticism of vaccines or vaccine damage, no coverage of vaccine damage rallies, no coverage of congressional hearings, nothing.
[00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:34.309]  Of course, six months ago, it was just disinfo in quotes and hoaxes.
[00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.270]  They said that they would cover up, that they would block.
[00:07:37.116 --> 00:07:43.861]  But now, Mike Adams has a big article up on InfoWars.com and NaturalNews.com that links to all the sources on this.
[00:07:44.602 --> 00:07:59.773]  They are openly announcing to the world, to the world, that all unauthorized commenting on vaccines, period, will be unauthorized.
[00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:05.758]  Remember just four months ago, Zuckerberg said, Alex Jones is the highest level of banned.
[00:08:07.116 --> 00:08:11.499]  You will not even say his name or his website unless it's in a negative connotation?
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.141]  Turning Facebook into a digital re-education camp?
[00:08:17.122 --> 00:08:31.030]  Well, now they've issued guidelines that Mike Adams has linked on the story on the front page of InfoWars.com saying that no unauthorized human opinion period will be allowed.
[00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:34.513]  And now that they've gotten to this point, it makes perfect sense.
[00:08:34.533 --> 00:08:36.214]  That was always the point of AI.
[00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:48.801]  That was always the point, is to deliver total control, orthodoxy, and to issue canons that are enforced by our digital overlords.
[00:08:49.902 --> 00:08:55.807]  That's why the ADL and other organizations are threatening to have Zuckerberg arrested if he doesn't give them power.
[00:08:56.448 --> 00:08:58.169]  Because this is the power.
[00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.291]  This is the Eye of Sauron.
[00:09:00.812 --> 00:09:01.933]  This is the One Ring.
[00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.110]  Here's the headline.
[00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:09.411]  Facebook bans all content on vaccine awareness, including facts about vaccine ingredients.
[00:09:09.471 --> 00:09:14.293]  Before long, Facebook won't even allow any human opinions at all.
[00:09:15.113 --> 00:09:25.595]  Just as we warned would happen, the tech giants are now moving aggressively to ban all speech that contradicts whatever official, that's a quote, position is decided to be the truth by the corrupt establishment.
[00:09:26.476 --> 00:09:29.056]  And then it goes on to lay it all out.
[00:09:29.116 --> 00:09:31.937]  They are now saying that you're not allowed to put
[00:09:32.944 --> 00:09:42.012]  CDC and drug company inserts online that by law come with each container multi-shot vial of the vaccine.
[00:09:42.052 --> 00:09:44.774]  We've always been able to checkmate them with that on air.
[00:09:46.156 --> 00:09:56.384]  Showing you where it says it gives you Guillain-Barré, neurological disorders, narcolepsy, cancer, kidney failure, type 1 diabetes, just triggers your pancreas to fail.
[00:09:57.538 --> 00:09:59.499]  Now they're saying that is not allowed.
[00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:09.361]  And the CDC has pulled off their website where they admitted SV40, the cancer virus, was in the vaccines to over 100 million Americans and killed many of those individuals.
[00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:11.401]  So again, we have the facts.
[00:10:11.441 --> 00:10:15.902]  We have the secret vaccine multi-billion dollar fund set up in the 1980s.
[00:10:16.303 --> 00:10:17.403]  We have all the total proof.
[00:10:18.365 --> 00:10:19.966]  And so understand, it's not just going to be vaccines.
[00:10:20.526 --> 00:10:21.667]  It's going to be nuclear power.
[00:10:22.427 --> 00:10:23.868]  It's going to be the arms industry.
[00:10:24.509 --> 00:10:32.053]  It's going to be glyphosate and Roundup and Monsanto, because they're all getting their asses handed to them.
[00:10:32.873 --> 00:10:35.235]  And so they have a perfect storm.
[00:10:37.288 --> 00:10:51.453]  of big chemical companies, the banks, all of them, now coming in being able to block any criticism or block coverage of lawsuits or block coverage of what's in the actual ingredients list of their products.
[00:10:52.073 --> 00:10:59.396]  This is unbelievably evil and shows you where all this information control is going.
[00:11:01.056 --> 00:11:02.837]  So I'm going to hand this back over.
[00:11:04.483 --> 00:11:06.405]  David Knight, who's hosting the show live today.
[00:11:06.445 --> 00:11:08.447]  I'm dealing with a lot of stuff.
[00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:09.589]  I'm being deposed today.
[00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:16.276]  I'll be back in the studio later to get more into this, but we must get Congress and the President to act.
[00:11:17.967 --> 00:11:20.509]  These companies aren't allowed to block consumer reviews.
[00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:25.413]  They aren't allowed to block people telling their own testimonies about how they had convulsions after they took the shots.
[00:11:26.133 --> 00:11:27.034]  This is unbelievable.
[00:11:27.074 --> 00:11:28.075]  It's prior constraint.
[00:11:28.575 --> 00:11:36.582]  It's racketeering between major industries to suppress the public and consumer issues that the public has a right to know about.
[00:11:37.503 --> 00:11:39.685]  This is total mafia level suppression.
[00:11:40.265 --> 00:11:43.768]  We all know about Silkwood and things like that covering up radiation.
[00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:49.072]  This is well beyond that on a gargantuan scale and is incredibly dangerous.
[00:11:49.812 --> 00:11:56.197]  The globalists want to be able to deploy their 5G and all these soft kill weapons and not have us complain while it's all happening.
[00:11:56.537 --> 00:11:58.318]  This is the anti-takeover
[00:11:59.199 --> 00:11:59.599]  System.
[00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:02.441]  This is the anti-human grid.
[00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:05.262]  This is the anti-development system.
[00:12:05.722 --> 00:12:10.745]  This is the digital straitjacket being placed over humanity to totally control us.
[00:12:11.285 --> 00:12:13.566]  Now back to David Knight and the live broadcast.
[00:12:13.586 --> 00:12:15.147]  But this is where it's all leading.
[00:12:15.527 --> 00:12:17.028]  This is where it was all planning to go.
[00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:18.809]  The war isn't coming.
[00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:19.649]  The war is here.
[00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.251]  We have the ADL saying arrest tech heads that don't submit to them.
[00:12:23.872 --> 00:12:26.293]  Purge everybody off the internet that doesn't submit.
[00:12:28.024 --> 00:12:32.547]  This is, this is the evil of our time and it's the greatest evil ever faced by humanity.
[00:12:32.987 --> 00:12:35.329]  Please get the article at Infowars.com out to everyone you know.
[00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.951]  Alright, that's Alex Jones.
[00:12:38.071 --> 00:12:40.713]  I'm David Knight and I'll be running the show from here.
[00:12:40.753 --> 00:12:42.774]  We have other reports from Alex that'll be coming up.
[00:12:42.854 --> 00:12:44.095]  We've got other interviews.
[00:12:44.175 --> 00:12:46.877]  Eric Peters is going to be joining us in this hour, in the third hour.
[00:12:47.497 --> 00:12:51.560]  We're going to be joined by Zach Voorhees, the Google whistleblower.
[00:12:52.381 --> 00:12:54.783]  And it'll be interesting to talk to him because we've just had
[00:12:55.863 --> 00:13:11.215]  Twitter blacklisting Project Veritas, and of course that's where he went to release the documents that showed that Google was altering the news, as we've talked to him multiple times on InfoWars and on my program.
[00:13:11.955 --> 00:13:16.219]  So it's okay for them to change the news, but do not report that.
[00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:20.181]  As a matter of fact, why would we be surprised that they would say that we cannot report
[00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:23.728]  The contents of the vaccine insert.
[00:13:24.188 --> 00:13:25.269]  That's objective science.
[00:13:26.109 --> 00:13:29.211]  Well, they're putting a gag on people, even talking about gender.
[00:13:29.791 --> 00:13:30.872]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[00:13:30.892 --> 00:13:31.272]  Stay with us.
[00:13:32.752 --> 00:13:36.534]  Welcome back, as we're talking about the story that's at the top of InfoWars.com.
[00:13:36.574 --> 00:13:42.657]  Story from Mike Adams, talking about how Facebook has openly said now they're not going to be doing the shadow banning.
[00:13:42.697 --> 00:13:44.538]  This is going to be overt, not covert.
[00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:51.661]  And, uh, we have been able to see that, uh, this, the effects of these, uh, covert bannings.
[00:13:51.941 --> 00:13:54.702]  Many people have experienced that, but of course, you know, and that's so, um, 2017.
[00:13:54.742 --> 00:14:02.665]  It was 2018 that they overtly banned Alex Jones, InfoWars, and not just Facebook.
[00:14:03.285 --> 00:14:07.346]  Uh, all of the technocratic elite and all these, uh, platforms.
[00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:12.848]  And as I've said many times on my show, and you can catch that show, uh, three hours before this show begins in the mornings.
[00:14:13.678 --> 00:14:18.221]  I said many times on that show, this is coming from the government.
[00:14:18.401 --> 00:14:22.284]  This is coming from DARPA, the people who seek to weaponize information.
[00:14:23.224 --> 00:14:24.585]  Look, there is an information war.
[00:14:24.605 --> 00:14:25.986]  We've had Hillary Clinton say that.
[00:14:26.046 --> 00:14:27.107]  She said it's an information war.
[00:14:27.127 --> 00:14:27.607]  We're losing it.
[00:14:27.647 --> 00:14:31.709]  We've had people from the military-industrial complex saying that in Senate testimony.
[00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.731]  We have to silence the cannons on social media.
[00:14:34.771 --> 00:14:35.192]  And they did.
[00:14:36.072 --> 00:14:37.373]  About nine months after they said that.
[00:14:37.573 --> 00:14:38.053]  They did that.
[00:14:38.093 --> 00:14:39.094]  They took off Alex Jones.
[00:14:39.114 --> 00:14:41.596]  But then they went after anybody else who pushed back.
[00:14:42.344 --> 00:14:46.906]  against endless regime change and coups and endless wars.
[00:14:48.066 --> 00:15:04.052]  They came after another 800 outlets two months later and now they're telling, as Alex pointed out, they're going beyond individual publishers, individual websites, they're going beyond that to go after a kind of topical censorship.
[00:15:05.247 --> 00:15:07.169]  And that's precisely what they're able to do with this.
[00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:18.961]  They create a digital marketplace of free speech, essentially a speaker's corner in Hyde Park, if you're familiar with that, in the UK.
[00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:23.046]  And then they get to the point where they say, well, you know, if you're not there, nobody's going to see you.
[00:15:23.086 --> 00:15:25.849]  Everybody goes to these social media platforms.
[00:15:25.909 --> 00:15:27.751]  People have to turn away from that.
[00:15:28.723 --> 00:15:30.963]  And go back to going to individual sites.
[00:15:30.983 --> 00:15:33.944]  That's one of the reasons why Drudge came here and warned us that was where this is headed.
[00:15:34.284 --> 00:15:35.524]  That is precisely where it's headed.
[00:15:35.624 --> 00:15:42.486]  They create a massive public square and then they say, we own that, we're going to control that, we're going to define what is going to be allowed to be said there.
[00:15:42.546 --> 00:15:55.908]  And so as I was saying, at the top of the hour, not only are they going to be expanding this, as Mike Adams points out, to include GMOs, cancer treatments, water fluoridation, politics, elections, abortions, pesticides, nutrition.
[00:15:56.909 --> 00:16:00.411]  Children's gender, talking about how you're going to talk to children, for example.
[00:16:00.591 --> 00:16:02.512]  All of this will be there.
[00:16:02.612 --> 00:16:14.979]  And when we look at the very first thing he mentioned, GMOs, we're seeing article after article about human genetic modification and how they seek to use that, offer that as a treatment.
[00:16:15.059 --> 00:16:16.180]  And you need to understand
[00:16:16.954 --> 00:16:19.556]  That this is not an exact science.
[00:16:20.257 --> 00:16:24.140]  We're having a lot of people who are breeding animals who've been warning us about that.
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:30.945]  Cattle breeders and others saying this CRISPR-Cas9 approach of genetic modification is not a scalpel.
[00:16:31.826 --> 00:16:32.686]  It is a chainsaw.
[00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:34.408]  It's very crude.
[00:16:34.508 --> 00:16:36.369]  It produces unintended effects.
[00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.271]  It introduces alien DNA.
[00:16:39.491 --> 00:16:41.333]  Also other types of contamination.
[00:16:41.393 --> 00:16:45.036]  And that's just assuming that they know which genes to cut.
[00:16:46.476 --> 00:16:50.078]  These are the same people telling you that we have a massive amount of junk DNA.
[00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:53.099]  That tells me that they haven't figured it all out.
[00:16:54.199 --> 00:16:55.980]  And I'm not surprised that they haven't figured it out.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.181]  They're not God.
[00:16:57.221 --> 00:16:58.161]  They're not that smart.
[00:16:58.201 --> 00:16:59.102]  They didn't design it.
[00:17:01.022 --> 00:17:13.708]  And yet, when we look at this particular case, and I'm really wondering what Facebook is going to do with this, because we've got ABC News, part of the official approved media, reporting from the World Health Organization,
[00:17:15.058 --> 00:17:16.820]  And this just came out last week.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:26.348]  Partners noted nine new polio cases caused by the polio vaccine in Nigeria, Congo, Central Africa, Republic, and Angola.
[00:17:26.408 --> 00:17:31.072]  Seven countries elsewhere in Africa have had similar outbreaks.
[00:17:31.852 --> 00:17:33.754]  And cases have been reported in Asia.
[00:17:34.194 --> 00:17:41.961]  Of the two countries where the polio remains endemic, Afghanistan and Pakistan, vaccine-linked cases have been identified.
[00:17:43.012 --> 00:17:47.376]  What they're doing is they're giving people live virus in an oral polio vaccine.
[00:17:47.796 --> 00:17:50.539]  Now, we have reported this for many years.
[00:17:51.219 --> 00:17:58.686]  We said, look, as they're pushing these vaccines into the third world and people are coming in, they're saying, you're giving this disease to our children.
[00:17:58.726 --> 00:18:02.369]  Oh no, that's not polio, that's just a weak polio-like symptom.
[00:18:02.709 --> 00:18:03.430]  That's not polio.
[00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:04.951]  Now they're admitting it.
[00:18:06.212 --> 00:18:09.095]  But will Facebook and these other people, will they control that information?
[00:18:10.425 --> 00:18:23.771]  As ABC reports, four African countries have reported new cases of polio linked to the oral vaccine, as global health numbers show that there are now more children being paralyzed by viruses originating in vaccines than in the wild.
[00:18:25.151 --> 00:18:29.693]  And they go on to say, well, it's a highly infectious disease that spreads with contaminated water or food.
[00:18:29.733 --> 00:18:33.835]  Maybe that would be the way to control it, do you think?
[00:18:35.086 --> 00:18:39.367]  It usually strikes children under 5, and about 1 in 200 infections they say results in paralysis.
[00:18:39.407 --> 00:18:46.308]  Now they go on to say to eradicate polio, you have to, and they start to talk about this concept of herd immunity.
[00:18:47.728 --> 00:18:49.909]  And really this has become the herd mentality.
[00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:56.290]  Because the idea of herd immunity was something that came out long before vaccines.
[00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:01.131]  And the problem with vaccines is that they don't convey, if they do convey immunity, it's not lasting immunity.
[00:19:02.352 --> 00:19:06.914]  If they don't have any adverse side effects, it still doesn't give you lasting immunity.
[00:19:06.954 --> 00:19:13.257]  That's why they're increasing the number of MMR vaccines shots that they require from one to two.
[00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:17.799]  Now they're talking about doing it three times because it is temporary at best.
[00:19:18.919 --> 00:19:24.262]  Now you can't get herd immunity if you have temporary immunity.
[00:19:25.689 --> 00:19:28.970]  That's the logical fallacy of what they're selling everybody.
[00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:37.491]  But we've seen many other cases where patient zero in these MMR vaccines was somebody who'd been vaccinated multiple times.
[00:19:39.212 --> 00:19:42.852]  And so this is not a new instance.
[00:19:42.892 --> 00:19:44.793]  But again, what is Facebook going to do with this?
[00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:45.693]  Are they going to cover this up?
[00:19:45.773 --> 00:19:46.753]  Are they going to say that's false?
[00:19:46.853 --> 00:19:52.274]  Because it's coming from the Independent Monitoring Board, a group that was set up by the World Health Organization.
[00:19:53.422 --> 00:19:54.763]  To assess polio eradication.
[00:19:55.144 --> 00:20:03.953]  They warned in this report that just broke last week, this month, that the vaccine-derived polio virus is, quote, spreading uncontrolled in West Africa.
[00:20:04.733 --> 00:20:10.039]  That it is bursting geographical boundaries and raising fundamental questions.
[00:20:10.139 --> 00:20:10.859]  Oh yes it is.
[00:20:12.101 --> 00:20:14.663]  These are fundamental questions that we've been raising for quite some time.
[00:20:15.824 --> 00:20:17.166]  Do you now believe it because of the source?
[00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:19.844]  There was also other data out there.
[00:20:19.864 --> 00:20:21.886]  I'm surprised that ABC is reporting this.
[00:20:21.906 --> 00:20:23.027]  They will bury it, I'm sure.
[00:20:23.587 --> 00:20:29.531]  Twitter has blacklisted Project Veritas now from running ads.
[00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:31.272]  This is the second aspect of this.
[00:20:32.253 --> 00:20:37.157]  And again, we saw the same type of thing happening when they were pushing Obamacare.
[00:20:38.658 --> 00:20:41.520]  They had ABC News in the Obama White House.
[00:20:42.805 --> 00:20:51.952]  And they were running daily reports telling everybody how Obamacare was going to solve all of our health problems, right, on a daily basis.
[00:20:51.992 --> 00:20:57.617]  And the Republicans came back and said, well, we would like to have some equal time to push back on that, to give our side of the story.
[00:20:58.858 --> 00:21:00.979]  They said, no, we're not going to give you equal time on ABC.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.421]  And they said, well, we'd like to buy ads.
[00:21:04.582 --> 00:21:06.123]  And they said, no, we're not going to sell you ads.
[00:21:07.164 --> 00:21:10.587]  And now that same approach is being used by social media.
[00:21:11.434 --> 00:21:16.278]  Twitter, Facebook, Google are all saying they're not going to sell political ads.
[00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:18.360]  They're going to purge your ads.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.241]  They're not going to allow you to have equal access.
[00:21:20.922 --> 00:21:26.526]  And then they're going to block you from even paying to put your opinion out there.
[00:21:27.547 --> 00:21:32.431]  Take a look at Bloomberg as he says, well, we're not going to delve into the background of other Democrat candidates.
[00:21:32.451 --> 00:21:35.313]  We're not going to delve in the background of Michael Bloomberg himself.
[00:21:35.393 --> 00:21:35.834]  Oh, we will.
[00:21:36.465 --> 00:21:36.785]  We will.
[00:21:36.805 --> 00:21:45.787]  If you want to hear about it, you're going to have to tune in here because they are going to completely control everything you see, everything you hear, and they're not going to let you talk about it either.
[00:21:46.507 --> 00:21:47.107]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:47.147 --> 00:21:47.527]  Stay with us.
[00:21:47.867 --> 00:21:48.347]  Welcome back.
[00:21:48.408 --> 00:21:49.008]  We are live.
[00:21:49.028 --> 00:21:50.528]  Going back to David Knight here in a moment.
[00:21:50.548 --> 00:22:04.971]  At the start of the broadcast, you heard me get into an article by Mike Adams that's posted at NaturalNews.com and InfoWars.com that is of the highest importance in my view, and it breaks down how big tech has now announced that no authorized statements
[00:22:06.181 --> 00:22:08.263]  About vaccines will be allowed on Facebook.
[00:22:08.403 --> 00:22:10.065]  Other platforms are following suit.
[00:22:10.625 --> 00:22:11.807]  This means consumer reports.
[00:22:11.847 --> 00:22:12.708]  This means warnings.
[00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:13.889]  This means activist groups.
[00:22:13.929 --> 00:22:15.971]  This means congressional testimony.
[00:22:16.011 --> 00:22:17.012]  This means speeches.
[00:22:18.353 --> 00:22:19.214]  Total suppression.
[00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:30.125]  This is the holy grail of the chemical companies and others to be able to block consumers reporting on the damages and the things that they have been known to do.
[00:22:30.706 --> 00:22:41.936]  And the secret damage fund where they pay out billions of dollars every decade to people that know how to jump through all the hoops who have been damaged or who have lost family members due to their activities.
[00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:44.297]  So this is total prior constraint.
[00:22:44.358 --> 00:22:45.519]  It's where it's all been going.
[00:22:46.399 --> 00:22:51.043]  The system has been testing us for a long, long time, seeing what they can get away with.
[00:22:51.243 --> 00:22:57.729]  And because there's been a total capitulation and the decision has been made by Congress and others to just let big tech do whatever they want,
[00:22:58.669 --> 00:23:13.896]  They are now organizing and merging with the chemical companies, the drug companies, the munition companies, and others, and really bringing in a technocracy in their own words that suppresses all human activity and all human resistance.
[00:23:14.897 --> 00:23:22.141]  The people need to come together, regardless if you're liberal or conservative, old or young, black or white, and realize this is a threat to everybody.
[00:23:22.621 --> 00:23:23.601]  They made it partisan.
[00:23:23.641 --> 00:23:25.042]  They chose me as the test case.
[00:23:25.649 --> 00:23:28.851]  So that liberals and leftists and others would hungrily go along with this.
[00:23:30.472 --> 00:23:32.594]  And it's a nightmare scenario.
[00:23:32.634 --> 00:23:34.415]  This is not about Alex Jones.
[00:23:34.435 --> 00:23:35.596]  This is about all of us.
[00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:37.617]  It's incredibly dangerous.
[00:23:38.558 --> 00:23:40.900]  And David Knight, I know, is covering a lot of topics today.
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.501]  He'll be getting into this some more later, obviously.
[00:23:43.521 --> 00:23:46.583]  I'm told the Google whistleblowers will be popping back in.
[00:23:47.044 --> 00:23:48.605]  Zach Voorhees and so much more.
[00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:54.977]  This is prior constraint, no human opinion allowed by the AI, unless it's the orthodoxy.
[00:23:54.997 --> 00:23:56.978]  And that's what Zuckerberg and others have said.
[00:23:57.398 --> 00:23:59.999]  We must start resisting this.
[00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:01.500]  We must start speaking out against this.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.842]  We must, as a population, start valuing freedom again, or we're going to be totally enslaved.
[00:24:07.423 --> 00:24:09.043]  People before us fought for freedom.
[00:24:09.283 --> 00:24:09.984]  They stood up for it.
[00:24:10.004 --> 00:24:10.764]  They were territorial.
[00:24:11.084 --> 00:24:12.645]  That's why we had so much freedom in America.
[00:24:13.065 --> 00:24:17.587]  Everywhere else, people didn't stand up and they are slaves and it's hierarchical systems.
[00:24:18.404 --> 00:24:27.530]  And we're going into the final hierarchical system where the globalists believe they're going to merge with machines and have the 2.0 new human and the old homo sapiens is going to fade in the past.
[00:24:27.991 --> 00:24:29.892]  This is their authoritarian vision.
[00:24:31.033 --> 00:24:32.974]  This is not a science fiction dystopia.
[00:24:33.034 --> 00:24:35.056]  This is life as we enter the year 2020.
[00:24:35.196 --> 00:24:39.559]  And InfoWars is pushing and promoting a pro-human future.
[00:24:40.019 --> 00:24:42.301]  That's why your prayer and your support is beyond paramount.
[00:24:43.642 --> 00:24:47.084]  We are literally neck and neck with the enemy being able to stay on the air for more than a year.
[00:24:48.109 --> 00:24:52.994]  I'm already spending reserves and already not reordering some product in the future to be able to fund ourselves.
[00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:59.241]  We are into our reserve tank and need your financial support and need you to step up now.
[00:24:59.621 --> 00:25:02.484]  We finally have the official Black Friday sales here.
[00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:05.207]  We have Black Friday comes early, but this is even bigger.
[00:25:05.608 --> 00:25:09.692]  Triple Patriot points, 15 points your next order for the first time ever.
[00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:24.094]  Free shipping, 50% off DNA Force Plus, our flagship product with the PQQ, a go-to that everybody should have, and a free bottle of Brain Force Plus when you get the DNA Force Plus at 50% off with the free shipping.
[00:25:24.114 --> 00:25:24.854]  Triple Patriot points.
[00:25:25.396 --> 00:25:26.637]  So everything must go.
[00:25:26.677 --> 00:25:27.918]  This is how we're funding our operation.
[00:25:27.958 --> 00:25:29.218]  Plus, these are products you really need.
[00:25:29.538 --> 00:25:30.619]  The Krill Oil everybody loves.
[00:25:30.639 --> 00:25:31.300]  It's so amazing.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.200]  It's back in stock.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.082]  Vitamineral Fusion back in stock and so much more.
[00:25:35.102 --> 00:25:41.145]  But whatever you do, realize this sale has to end by early next week because a lot of these products are selling out.
[00:25:41.566 --> 00:25:43.687]  A lot of the products like the Azobeats have come back in.
[00:25:44.187 --> 00:25:48.510]  Just realize that we're all in this together and funding InfoWars is critical.
[00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:53.893]  The enemy knows that for their plan to succeed, they need InfoWars off the air.
[00:25:54.417 --> 00:25:58.619]  You understand for us to succeed, have a pro-human future, we need to stay on air.
[00:25:58.939 --> 00:26:00.140]  So let's all hang together.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.541]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:26:01.881 --> 00:26:02.922]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:26:02.942 --> 00:26:03.662]  Please take action.
[00:26:03.682 --> 00:26:04.582]  Now back to David Knight.
[00:26:06.003 --> 00:26:08.224]  All right, that's Alex Jones and I'm David Knight.
[00:26:08.244 --> 00:26:14.248]  Again, typically you can find me three hours before this program on this same InfoWars network.
[00:26:14.348 --> 00:26:20.531]  But I understand folks that they have moved their censorship, their control, from InfoWars to everyone.
[00:26:21.813 --> 00:26:29.518]  We've seen, just in the last 24 hours, we've seen Project Veritas, as well as Andy Ngo, get hit with censorship claims.
[00:26:29.938 --> 00:26:30.779]  Over absolutely nothing.
[00:26:31.479 --> 00:26:39.425]  Just things that these people who run these platforms that they were enabled to establish, they've now taken over the public square, they say, we own it.
[00:26:40.385 --> 00:26:44.628]  And it's amazing to me to see how many conservatives and libertarians will come out and say, that's right, they won it!
[00:26:45.249 --> 00:26:45.649]  They own it!
[00:26:46.069 --> 00:26:46.369]  They own it!
[00:26:46.409 --> 00:26:47.750]  They won the competition and they own it.
[00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.952]  No, no, the purpose of government
[00:26:50.708 --> 00:26:52.889]  The purpose of government is to protect our rights.
[00:26:54.169 --> 00:27:01.370]  And they no more are allowed to steal our public square than they are allowed to steal your home or your car.
[00:27:01.551 --> 00:27:12.753]  Just walk in and say, well, you know, I'm John D. Rockefeller, or I'm Jeff Bezos, or I'm Bill Gates, or I'm Jack Dorsey, and I'm taking your car.
[00:27:14.254 --> 00:27:15.634]  No, no, we don't have that kind of a system.
[00:27:16.567 --> 00:27:21.350]  We should have a rule of law, and we had that type of a system back in 1946.
[00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:26.373]  They said, well, even if the public square is privately owned, we're not going to allow them to shut down free speech.
[00:27:26.694 --> 00:27:27.354]  But now they're doing it.
[00:27:27.714 --> 00:27:30.236]  And they're doing it at the behest of the government.
[00:27:30.256 --> 00:27:34.299]  So we've seen this control system go from Infowars to everybody.
[00:27:35.019 --> 00:27:37.661]  We've seen it go from politics to everything.
[00:27:38.578 --> 00:27:46.383]  I mean, it's going to, as we pointed out, it's going to health, it's going to morality, it's going to religion, anything that they seek to change or anything they seek to control.
[00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:53.267]  And let me tell you, it's also going to be going from cyberspace, from the internet, to physical space.
[00:27:54.107 --> 00:27:59.811]  These same companies are laying down the infrastructure that's going to be used to create the smart cities.
[00:28:01.198 --> 00:28:07.420]  They are laying down the infrastructure for what is essentially, one author has called it, the Google Archipelago.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.361]  It will be an open-air prison, a gulag itself.
[00:28:11.421 --> 00:28:13.922]  And they're not going to stop until they control everything.
[00:28:14.062 --> 00:28:24.165]  And one of the primary bases on which they sell this to everybody, of course the smart cities are sold to us all as a way to protect the environment.
[00:28:25.729 --> 00:28:33.392]  And they're wringing their hands on USA Today, saying that carbon dioxide has now reached a record high in the Earth's atmosphere.
[00:28:33.432 --> 00:28:41.456]  There is no sign of a slowdown, let alone a decline in greenhouse gas concentration, despite all the commitments under the Paris Agreement.
[00:28:42.892 --> 00:28:49.077]  To which I ask, then, well, why aren't we seeing that same thing happening to the temperatures, right?
[00:28:49.137 --> 00:28:58.364]  Didn't we have the hockey stick that was predicated on the link between a rise in greenhouse gases and CO2 and a rise in temperature?
[00:28:58.404 --> 00:28:59.625]  Wasn't that everything?
[00:28:59.725 --> 00:29:03.028]  The inconvenient truth that Al Gore was selling everybody 20 years ago?
[00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:07.672]  Selling that hockey stick invention from Michael Mann?
[00:29:08.598 --> 00:29:14.279]  So if we've got record carbon dioxide and they're wringing their hands about this, then where is the problem?
[00:29:15.599 --> 00:29:18.040]  It hasn't correlated to a record increase in temperature.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:24.741]  We've had, as a matter of fact, the Express is saying this is the coldest winter in 100 years in the UK.
[00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:30.302]  UK snow forecast as a three-month sub-zero freeze hits Britain.
[00:29:32.242 --> 00:29:35.023]  Nevertheless, you have the same guy, Michael Mann,
[00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:43.854]  is now engaged in a harassment lawsuit to shut down free speech and shut down debate about science because that's one of the other aspects of it.
[00:29:44.814 --> 00:29:54.019]  It's not just science as far as health issues go, but it's also the so-called science behind their agenda.
[00:29:54.679 --> 00:30:00.522]  It is the universal justification for government controlling everything.
[00:30:01.607 --> 00:30:04.009]  It is the justification for world government.
[00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:11.597]  You know, these people always bring in government, or add new government, or add new taxes, in order to address a problem.
[00:30:11.617 --> 00:30:13.439]  And so they have to have a global problem.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.341]  No global problem?
[00:30:15.381 --> 00:30:18.704]  Well, you invent one, quite frankly, which is what we're talking about.
[00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:25.391]  You talk about them wringing their hands about, well, nobody is, despite all the commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement,
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:32.982]  I've reported on my program how in India they're having to hook themselves up to oxygen bars because the air is so bad.
[00:30:33.523 --> 00:30:37.264]  In China, they're actually buying canned air from Switzerland.
[00:30:37.984 --> 00:30:38.765]  Why is this happening?
[00:30:39.745 --> 00:30:47.628]  Well, because these agreements that people have had, these commitments that they've had under the Paris Climate Accord, don't affect India or China at all.
[00:30:47.868 --> 00:30:52.650]  They're allowed to build the dirtiest power plants they want, unrestricted in quantity.
[00:30:53.956 --> 00:30:55.757]  And so you want to tell me this is a global problem?
[00:30:55.777 --> 00:30:59.839]  You want to tell me that the increase, the record increase in greenhouse gases?
[00:31:00.959 --> 00:31:04.261]  Yeah, they want to hide the fact that the temperature has actually declined.
[00:31:04.301 --> 00:31:06.822]  That was called ClimateGate.
[00:31:06.842 --> 00:31:07.443]  We'll be right back.
[00:31:07.463 --> 00:31:07.883]  Stay with us.
[00:31:08.643 --> 00:31:09.104]  Welcome back.
[00:31:09.144 --> 00:31:11.125]  Joining us now is Eric Peters.
[00:31:11.145 --> 00:31:12.965]  You can find him at epautos.com.
[00:31:13.005 --> 00:31:17.348]  And I wanted to get Eric Peters on because I wanted to talk about this reveal.
[00:31:18.448 --> 00:31:19.309]  Of course.
[00:31:36.827 --> 00:31:40.029]  About the business model of Elon Musk.
[00:31:40.109 --> 00:31:52.995]  He is the king of crony capitalism and he has, I don't know what the account is, we'll get the update from Eric Peters, but years ago it was worked out by the LA Times and others that he'd gotten four or five billion dollars.
[00:31:54.045 --> 00:32:11.413]  In terms of subsidy, I don't really care about what kind of cars people drive unless they tell me that I don't have a choice, unless they fund their business by taxing their competitors and have that money turned over to them.
[00:32:11.453 --> 00:32:13.233]  So joining us now is Eric Peters.
[00:32:13.253 --> 00:32:14.154]  Thank you for joining us, Eric.
[00:32:14.574 --> 00:32:15.014]  Oh, you bet.
[00:32:15.234 --> 00:32:16.575]  Great to be back, as always, David.
[00:32:16.895 --> 00:32:26.141]  And by the way, watching that reveal, I felt like I had been transported back to 1978 and was watching a promo for the new TV series Buck Rogers in the 25th century.
[00:32:26.821 --> 00:32:35.026]  Well, I had a lot of people that I saw were talking about how it looked like they'd gotten the design or had designed it on a Nintendo 64 system.
[00:32:35.526 --> 00:32:42.550]  Yeah, remember back in those days when they didn't have a lot of money for special effects, they would cut up sheets of cardboard and glue them together?
[00:32:43.889 --> 00:32:45.110]  I mean, that's what the thing looks like.
[00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.091]  It's astonishing to me.
[00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:51.094]  And the fact that they were able to roll that thing out and the audience didn't just fall out of their chairs laughing.
[00:32:51.354 --> 00:32:51.695]  I know!
[00:32:51.735 --> 00:32:52.976]  That was my reaction.
[00:32:53.016 --> 00:32:54.156]  I'm sure it was yours as well.
[00:32:54.477 --> 00:33:03.743]  And I told my family, I said, can you imagine the designers at Ferrari, who seem to always be able to crank out wonderful looking designs.
[00:33:03.783 --> 00:33:07.106]  Can you imagine them just banging their heads against the wall?
[00:33:07.665 --> 00:33:09.065]  I think the joke is on us.
[00:33:09.125 --> 00:33:12.026]  I think at this point Elon is laughing at the public.
[00:33:12.086 --> 00:33:13.866]  Like, will they not swallow?
[00:33:14.366 --> 00:33:27.769]  Well, I think the only thing that was more ridiculous than the appearance of it, the crude appearance of it, a lot of people suggested that perhaps they designed it that way because he chose to do it in steel, you know, like a DeLorean.
[00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:31.210]  Except the problem is that it looks more like a Pontiac Aztec, doesn't it?
[00:33:32.011 --> 00:33:33.533]  Without the virtues of the Aztec.
[00:33:34.294 --> 00:33:37.218]  The Aztec was actually a pretty practical and affordable vehicle.
[00:33:37.238 --> 00:33:39.701]  And by the way, speaking of the... Yeah, Walter White liked it.
[00:33:40.542 --> 00:33:41.544]  Heisenberg, right?
[00:33:41.564 --> 00:33:43.026]  He should have called him Heisenberg, right?
[00:33:43.326 --> 00:33:44.367]  Do you remember the DeLorean?
[00:33:45.148 --> 00:33:45.409]  Oh yeah!
[00:33:45.888 --> 00:33:47.789]  Well, so, you know, John Z had that idea, too.
[00:33:47.829 --> 00:33:49.069]  Hey, let's eliminate the paint.
[00:33:49.089 --> 00:33:51.731]  That way you'll never have to worry about the paint fading.
[00:33:51.751 --> 00:33:54.012]  We'll just cast the body in stainless steel.
[00:33:54.452 --> 00:33:57.914]  Not realizing that stainless steel, when it's exposed to the elements, tarnishes.
[00:33:58.674 --> 00:34:03.036]  And tarnished stainless steel, think about how hard it is to polish a spoon in the house.
[00:34:03.513 --> 00:34:08.698]  Yeah, I remember when they were selling it and people were talking about how difficult it was to get the handprints off of it and so forth.
[00:34:09.118 --> 00:34:12.842]  That was one of the things that was making it difficult for them to sell it.
[00:34:13.162 --> 00:34:25.113]  But as ridiculous and as humorous as the design is, then it took a turn as he said, well, you know, this is kind of some kind of a, you know, post-apocalyptic urban assault vehicle that he's designed here.
[00:34:27.956 --> 00:34:36.445]  His head designer throws a metal ball at the window and we all know what happened by now because it's gone viral on the internet.
[00:34:36.566 --> 00:34:45.736]  It breaks and we hear this explicative that we will not repeat from Elon Musk and he goes, well let's try it again and so he does it again and the other window breaks.
[00:34:46.156 --> 00:34:49.459]  But isn't that a literal manifestation of the whole problem?
[00:34:49.479 --> 00:34:54.564]  You know, the guy, it's serial lying, and here he's caught in yet another lie.
[00:34:54.965 --> 00:35:04.233]  He touts that the thing has shatterproof glass that can absorb the impact of a ball, and it smashes right in front of the whole audience, and nobody seems to care!
[00:35:05.174 --> 00:35:06.074]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[00:35:06.615 --> 00:35:08.455]  I saw people making excuses for it.
[00:35:08.475 --> 00:35:12.457]  It's like, well, he designed that to stop a 9mm bullet.
[00:35:12.537 --> 00:35:18.560]  And it's like, okay, well, let's send him to another demonstration with him sitting inside the thing and somebody shooting a bullet at him.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:23.362]  Have you ever watched an interview with somebody who is a member of a religious cult defending the cult leader?
[00:35:23.382 --> 00:35:24.262]  Yeah, I know.
[00:35:24.862 --> 00:35:26.623]  That's what you see on social media now, isn't it?
[00:35:27.051 --> 00:35:38.678]  Yeah, and the genius that Elon Musk, I'm going to give the guy his due, he has managed to shift the debate away from affordability and practicality onto all of these nonsensical considerations.
[00:35:39.278 --> 00:35:39.998]  How quick it is.
[00:35:40.179 --> 00:35:43.500]  Oh great, it can, you know, it's faster supposedly than a Porsche 911.
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.723]  Well, so is an F-18 hurled off the flight deck of an aircraft carrier, right?
[00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:49.500]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:54.303]  But you can't take your F-16 to work every day.
[00:35:54.323 --> 00:35:55.543]  Of course, they don't want you traveling.
[00:35:55.583 --> 00:35:57.925]  They don't want you to have mobility, and that's the whole issue behind this.
[00:35:57.945 --> 00:35:58.605]  No, and you know what?
[00:35:58.906 --> 00:36:06.730]  Bob Lutz, I'm sure you're familiar with Bob Lutz, he was an aviator, and he actually owned, I think he owned an F-18, I know he owned a MiG, but he bought it with his own money.
[00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:15.516]  And so I don't have any problem with anybody buying an electric car or a MiG, or if they want to buy a battleship, whatever they want to do with it, just don't have the effrontery to tell me
[00:36:19.117 --> 00:36:31.700]  Well, and that's the other thing, too, is that as they are talking about how anybody that makes a choice other than their choice needs to be banned, they are taking money from the people who make other choices and using it to subsidize this.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:40.962]  And I've said from the very beginning, my biggest beef with Elon Musk, besides the fact that he's using the lie of climate change as a business model to get subsidized,
[00:36:41.522 --> 00:36:45.063]  The other part of this is all of this talk about autopilot.
[00:36:45.363 --> 00:36:46.343]  We know where that is headed.
[00:36:46.824 --> 00:36:48.784]  We know that they're setting up a control system.
[00:36:48.804 --> 00:36:53.386]  You know, Agenda 21 became the UN 2030 Agenda for Smart Cities.
[00:36:53.946 --> 00:36:57.007]  And the underlying technology of that is 5G.
[00:36:57.687 --> 00:37:01.048]  They say, we're going to have 5G so we can drive the cars around from our centralized location.
[00:37:01.428 --> 00:37:07.412]  And of course, Elon Musk is putting up tens of thousands of satellites to beam 5G back at us.
[00:37:07.572 --> 00:37:08.873]  And people ought to have a problem with that.
[00:37:09.653 --> 00:37:10.754]  There's a lot of problems with that.
[00:37:11.214 --> 00:37:18.078]  Health issues that people are concerned about, as well as, of course, wait for it, privacy, surveillance, and mobility.
[00:37:18.178 --> 00:37:19.459]  All of those things are under attack.
[00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:22.181]  And so all this stuff comes together in this one guy.
[00:37:22.221 --> 00:37:23.522]  But he is the PR guy.
[00:37:23.562 --> 00:37:25.243]  He is the PT Barnum for this agenda.
[00:37:25.777 --> 00:37:39.749]  Well, he is, and I've mulled this over for many years, and I used to wonder, how can it be that this guy can go on and on and on and lose money consistently, even as much money as he takes in from all of his various scams, and maintain his operations?
[00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:46.154]  How is it that the media is so overwhelmingly complicit in peddling his lies and never holding him accountable for anything?
[00:37:47.021 --> 00:38:05.397]  My theory is that Elon Musk's job was to normalize the electric car in the first place, and then to sex it up, to shift the discussion away from affordability and practicality, which the EV can't compete on those criteria, and to talk up about how quick it is and how sexy it is and how many gadgets it has.
[00:38:06.229 --> 00:38:07.030]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:10.992]  And it's not just the press protecting him, but take a look at the SEC, for example.
[00:38:11.092 --> 00:38:15.075]  I mean, he put out, carelessly put out tweets, and then he came back and said, oh, well, it's a joke.
[00:38:15.495 --> 00:38:17.896]  But you had a lot of people who lost a lot of money off of that.
[00:38:17.937 --> 00:38:18.297]  Oh, sure.
[00:38:18.397 --> 00:38:20.238]  And people have gone to jail for less than that.
[00:38:20.358 --> 00:38:21.959]  And, of course, the SEC looked the other way.
[00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:26.302]  If he had done what he did, it would have been frog-marched before a federal grand jury, and that would have been the end of it.
[00:38:26.322 --> 00:38:26.662]  That's right.
[00:38:26.682 --> 00:38:28.883]  He would have been put into a dark hole for a very long time.
[00:38:29.164 --> 00:38:29.504]  That's right.
[00:38:29.744 --> 00:38:40.471]  And so that tells you right there how vital he, what a vital function he performs for the establishment that is selling us this UN 2030 agenda for smart cities.
[00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:48.356]  You know, he's out there setting up the infrastructure of 5Gs and yet at the same time, many people see him as a whistleblower for all of this.
[00:38:48.477 --> 00:38:50.198]  No, he is actually normalizing it.
[00:38:50.238 --> 00:38:51.619]  He's moving the Overton window.
[00:38:51.979 --> 00:38:54.861]  He's telling everybody, look, this is coming, get used to it, essentially.
[00:38:55.021 --> 00:38:56.182]  That's right.
[00:38:56.242 --> 00:38:59.424]  And again, it's being pushed from the top down and that's the subtext.
[00:39:00.064 --> 00:39:01.846]  Of maliciousness behind all of this.
[00:39:03.267 --> 00:39:07.011]  The refusal to discuss the affordability factor, for example.
[00:39:07.451 --> 00:39:15.979]  The idea that somehow the mass public, the average guy, is going to absorb an increase in the cost of driving on the order of 30-50%.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.562]  That's what we're talking about with these electric cars.
[00:39:19.222 --> 00:39:25.706]  You know, what it means is that people, average people, are going to be pushed out of a personal car by electric cars.
[00:39:25.906 --> 00:39:26.226]  That's right.
[00:39:26.366 --> 00:39:30.849]  And pushed into some form of government-controlled, corporate-controlled transportation.
[00:39:31.511 --> 00:39:32.571]  And that is the design.
[00:39:32.631 --> 00:39:37.072]  You know, when we talk about autonomous cars, we're not talking about, you know, that's what we have now.
[00:39:37.572 --> 00:39:38.953]  We have cars that are autonomous.
[00:39:39.493 --> 00:39:41.613]  We have cars that are anonymous.
[00:39:41.813 --> 00:39:43.454]  You know, we can drive around privately in it.
[00:39:43.754 --> 00:39:51.395]  No, they want to form a transportation where they can follow you and everything that you do and where they can centrally control your car.
[00:39:51.435 --> 00:39:52.416]  It's not going to be autonomous at all.
[00:39:52.436 --> 00:39:53.496]  It's going to be centrally controlled.
[00:39:54.056 --> 00:40:05.280]  It's interesting how they control the verbiage, how they've manipulated the language, exactly as you've just described, to take something that is the farthest thing from being autonomous and characterize it as that.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:15.984]  You know, one of the things, you talk about the verbiage that they use with this, calling it a cyber truck, and I've been talking about how Elon Musk, how Google, and these other people are very intent
[00:40:16.704 --> 00:40:21.587]  On setting up, you know, moving out of cyberspace to control physical space.
[00:40:21.607 --> 00:40:32.753]  You know, Google's got their Sidewalk Labs, that's what they call their experimental project in Toronto, but of course they're working on setting up other prototype experiments in Detroit and Denver and Alameda, California and so forth.
[00:40:33.013 --> 00:40:39.877]  They want corporate ownership of the town, and we know how that's going to look because we can see what they're doing to free speech in the cyberspace that they're controlling.
[00:40:39.977 --> 00:40:48.681]  And I think it's also interesting that he would call it the cyber truck, because these people are all moving from the cyberspace areas that they control now.
[00:40:48.761 --> 00:40:50.382]  They've exerted their control.
[00:40:50.402 --> 00:40:53.444]  They're moving from cyberspace into physical space.
[00:40:53.944 --> 00:40:54.324]  That's right.
[00:40:54.804 --> 00:41:00.067]  And as we have talked about many times in the past, this is not an organic, market-driven movement.
[00:41:00.647 --> 00:41:04.468]  I remember growing up when I was a little kid in Dallas.
[00:41:29.707 --> 00:41:47.235]  Different people that were friends with my dad talk about the new world order, world government, plan to set up super states, corporate governorship, how the family was going to be under attack and how they're trying to come for our guns.
[00:41:48.495 --> 00:41:49.936]  To me, that was just background noise.
[00:41:50.756 --> 00:41:58.700]  Then I got older, sat there and watched the propaganda on the television and endured it in public school, tried to go to college and
[00:41:59.821 --> 00:42:02.243]  Instantly recognized it as everything I've been warned about.
[00:42:03.064 --> 00:42:15.433]  And there was the seediness of it, the nastiness of it, just the oily criminality of the so-called professors and the real envy of America.
[00:42:16.554 --> 00:42:18.255]  It wasn't really disdain.
[00:42:18.996 --> 00:42:19.796]  It was envy.
[00:42:19.877 --> 00:42:26.842]  It was something they wanted to run, something they wanted to control, something they wanted to dominate.
[00:42:27.583 --> 00:42:45.508]  And it was that the very essence of what America stood for, individual freedom, the system not being about what class you came from and what your metal actually was, that threatened them because they were a bunch of followers who were trying to follow the old corrupt imperial system.
[00:42:45.948 --> 00:42:49.369]  They were just trying to recreate it and call it globalism.
[00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:52.750]  And now all these years later, 25 years after I've been on air,
[00:42:53.334 --> 00:42:54.614]  Hell, that was like 40 years ago.
[00:42:55.135 --> 00:42:59.076]  I see the open, classical manifestations of evil.
[00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:02.697]  Like, right out of a cartoon comic book.
[00:43:03.257 --> 00:43:14.781]  From the Democratic Party, and the neocons, and the ADL, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Hollywood, and the EU royalty, and the communist chi-comps.
[00:43:16.162 --> 00:43:22.564]  And it's just unbelievable that we haven't rejected this sooner, or stopped it faster.
[00:43:23.942 --> 00:43:25.743]  That's really what it comes down to.
[00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:27.003]  We've been asleep.
[00:43:27.343 --> 00:43:31.564]  Now that we've woken up, these slimy control freaks are just in a panic.
[00:43:32.145 --> 00:43:40.587]  So as negative as some of the news is, as tough as it is to learn how many sickos you've got running things, this is the beginning of healing.
[00:43:41.447 --> 00:43:42.948]  That's the beginning of turning this around.
[00:43:43.479 --> 00:43:45.739]  Yeah, they're coming after me, but that's well worth it.
[00:43:45.759 --> 00:43:47.040]  I mean, hell, what did I expect?
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.460]  I wanted to really take on the globalists.
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.100]  I wanted to hurt them.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:50.981]  I wanted to expose them.
[00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:53.981]  I wanted to reignite brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:43:54.021 --> 00:43:55.181]  I wanted to turn the tide.
[00:43:55.221 --> 00:43:58.542]  And what did I expect would happen as we started to turn the tide?
[00:43:58.902 --> 00:44:00.322]  No, I always knew this was coming.
[00:44:00.342 --> 00:44:03.403]  Because for anything good in this universe, you got to take your licks.
[00:44:04.143 --> 00:44:04.923]  Nothing good's free.
[00:44:06.044 --> 00:44:09.504]  Everything evil comes free because it wants your soul.
[00:44:09.544 --> 00:44:10.285]  It wants your life.
[00:44:10.305 --> 00:44:12.325]  It wants to take you over.
[00:44:13.237 --> 00:44:19.722]  But everything that's valuable, everything that's good, everything that fulfills is paid for.
[00:44:20.103 --> 00:44:21.103]  Blood, sweat, and tears.
[00:44:21.764 --> 00:44:24.186]  So I'm making my stand in Texas.
[00:44:24.946 --> 00:44:26.107]  What's the heart of this country?
[00:44:26.127 --> 00:44:26.848]  What's left of it?
[00:44:26.868 --> 00:44:36.576]  No matter how much of the goodness of this nation they destroy, there's a big remnant of good people who have a race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and want freedom for their children.
[00:44:37.156 --> 00:44:38.898]  They love God, but who hate the devil.
[00:44:39.713 --> 00:44:41.154]  So I make my stand here in Texas.
[00:44:41.674 --> 00:44:44.235]  I make my stand with you, and I appreciate all of you.
[00:44:44.875 --> 00:44:55.040]  So how about when you call in, you don't thank me for all I've done, but you think your ancestors, that they were good people and raised you right, and that we all just thank God that we're in this together and we've got each other.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.240]  Let's thank God.
[00:44:56.721 --> 00:44:58.622]  That's why it's sick when you call in and thank me.
[00:44:59.222 --> 00:44:59.582]  No.
[00:45:00.783 --> 00:45:03.724]  I'm just doing what it takes to try to not be on the side of evil.
[00:45:04.838 --> 00:45:06.099]  I'm just doing what you're supposed to do.
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:13.645]  But I gotta tell you, it's been a real blessing to get to know all of you and stand together and go through this because it's what makes us who we are.
[00:45:14.286 --> 00:45:19.911]  So as much as we dislike the globalists, can't stand them and hate them, just remember they're the losers.
[00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:23.414]  That's a fate worse than death, who they serve and who they are.
[00:45:24.635 --> 00:45:26.796]  Sign of history and the sign of the universe they've chosen.
[00:45:27.457 --> 00:45:30.159]  So, choose where you're gonna make your stand, those of you that haven't.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:31.861]  And for all of you,
[00:45:33.166 --> 00:45:34.067]  You made the right decision.
[00:45:34.107 --> 00:45:35.768]  You know you made it back when you were a little kid.
[00:45:36.928 --> 00:45:38.069]  It's who you come from.
[00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:39.230]  It's who you're always going to be.
[00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:40.490]  Predestined.
[00:45:41.251 --> 00:45:42.131]  Yeah, you got free will.
[00:45:42.151 --> 00:45:48.475]  You could have made the choice to go the wrong way, but it was destined that you'd be here in this fight today and I salute you.
[00:45:49.127 --> 00:45:49.648]  Welcome back.
[00:45:49.708 --> 00:45:50.469]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:45:50.509 --> 00:45:51.590]  David Knight is hosting.
[00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:57.997]  I have one more very important update on the story on InfoWars.com from Mike Adams from NaturalNews.com.
[00:45:58.017 --> 00:45:59.599]  It is so imperative for everybody to get out.
[00:45:59.799 --> 00:46:05.946]  Dealing with Facebook and other big tech, totally banning all unauthorized comments on vaccines.
[00:46:05.986 --> 00:46:08.229]  This is blocking consumer reports.
[00:46:08.269 --> 00:46:08.990]  This is blocking
[00:46:09.622 --> 00:46:13.625]  The will of the people to report on products that have adversely hurt them.
[00:46:13.745 --> 00:46:19.229]  Products that are given liability protection and have a secret vaccine payout program.
[00:46:19.269 --> 00:46:21.651]  Again, this is not a science fiction dystopia.
[00:46:23.172 --> 00:46:25.433]  This is the real world, 2019.
[00:46:25.613 --> 00:46:37.022]  Now look at the parallels with Monsanto and Roundup and the massive increases, multi-thousand percent in breast cancer in every country that adopts Roundup.
[00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:38.801]  Now they have signed it.
[00:46:38.841 --> 00:46:40.282]  Reports confirmed all over the world.
[00:46:40.362 --> 00:46:43.443]  Roundup has lost massive suits.
[00:46:43.503 --> 00:46:47.225]  The company that makes it, Monsanto, with all its famous evil.
[00:46:47.685 --> 00:46:49.125]  Same folks that brought you Diet Coke.
[00:46:49.145 --> 00:46:50.566]  Same folks that brought you Agent Orange.
[00:46:51.066 --> 00:46:52.527]  Same folks that brought you Dioxin.
[00:46:53.127 --> 00:46:55.848]  And they always covered up what they were doing.
[00:46:56.308 --> 00:46:58.429]  They know what they're doing.
[00:46:59.009 --> 00:47:04.191]  Just like Bayer Pharmaceutical with the Clintons shipping tainted blood out of Arkansas and then the U.S.
[00:47:04.787 --> 00:47:09.008]  for over a decade, gave millions of people HIV and AIDS and hepatitis.
[00:47:09.789 --> 00:47:13.230]  They knew what they were doing, and that all came out in the documents.
[00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:19.872]  They did it on purpose, because for them, this is a eugenics plan.
[00:47:21.052 --> 00:47:32.676]  So, think about how desperate they are to not even let you know that in Mike Adams' article, he's linked to whistleblowers, high level CDC,
[00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:47.422]  From 2000 and 2010, different whistleblowers who were in the meetings at the highest level with the CDC director saying, my God, I'm not going to let my grandson take any vaccines.
[00:47:48.023 --> 00:47:49.284]  We've brain damaged millions.
[00:47:49.344 --> 00:47:50.485]  We've got to cover this up.
[00:47:50.865 --> 00:47:51.946]  There'll be a revolution.
[00:47:52.787 --> 00:47:55.949]  Back in the day, that was on ABC News back in 2003, but not in 2019 going into 2020.
[00:48:01.397 --> 00:48:03.979]  The inserts say they do all this to you.
[00:48:04.419 --> 00:48:06.180]  You have a right to know about the side effects.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:11.223]  It's like speaking of Bayer, when you take aspirin, yes, it can thin your blood.
[00:48:11.303 --> 00:48:14.625]  Yes, it can do good things for you, but it also has some bad side effects.
[00:48:15.406 --> 00:48:23.271]  Well, the side effects of vaccines are far worse than aspirin or far worse than corticotipic steroids or far worse than so many other drugs.
[00:48:23.351 --> 00:48:29.735]  But notice when you see vaccine ads, you don't see the regular warning at the end.
[00:48:30.623 --> 00:48:32.104]  Where they say, be sure and read the warning.
[00:48:32.564 --> 00:48:41.048]  They're trying to pass laws where the warnings won't even have to be in the ampule, in the drug delivery, in the packaging.
[00:48:41.769 --> 00:48:45.571]  You have vaccine fact sheets that aren't fact sheets they give you at the drugstore.
[00:48:45.871 --> 00:48:46.671]  That's disinfo.
[00:48:46.731 --> 00:48:48.112]  You want the insert.
[00:48:49.012 --> 00:48:57.637]  I'm going to send the crew back into Walgreens and back into CVS today to get as many of the inserts supposed to give them to you by law from the
[00:48:58.752 --> 00:49:08.294]  Pharmacists, and then tomorrow I'm going to start the show, the entire first hour, reading you the MMR shot, the flu shot, the Gardasil shot.
[00:49:08.854 --> 00:49:10.414]  So I'm sending the crew in today.
[00:49:10.434 --> 00:49:12.575]  We've got a bunch from over the years I've shown on air.
[00:49:12.975 --> 00:49:17.136]  We can dig those out of our archive, but I'm going to show you where it says it can eat your pancreas.
[00:49:17.456 --> 00:49:22.717]  I'm going to show you where it says it can give you permanent neurological disorders like Guillain-Barre's that paralyzes you.
[00:49:23.297 --> 00:49:24.817]  I'm going to show you everything.
[00:49:25.663 --> 00:49:30.767]  And there's coming a time, it's basically here, where you won't be able to even get to InfoWars and see these videos.
[00:49:31.207 --> 00:49:36.070]  We have to have our own platform, Bandot Video, in America, just to show you these.
[00:49:36.831 --> 00:49:38.812]  So, midnight's not coming folks, it's here.
[00:49:39.152 --> 00:49:40.573]  We're not two minutes away, we're here.
[00:49:41.494 --> 00:49:42.895]  And people better start acting like it.
[00:49:42.915 --> 00:49:46.037]  We've been eased into this tyranny, like the frog in the boiling pot.
[00:49:47.018 --> 00:49:53.062]  Now back to David Knight, in Austin, Texas, in the InfoWars Center, that is under major globalist siege, because
[00:49:53.717 --> 00:49:54.417]  They're gonna go down.
[00:49:54.457 --> 00:49:55.218]  They're gonna collapse.
[00:49:55.238 --> 00:49:58.399]  Their house of cards is coming down if we've got speech and if you've got speech.
[00:49:58.939 --> 00:50:00.920]  That's why this operation is so critical.
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.281]  That's why the ADL's calling for us to be shut down.
[00:50:03.301 --> 00:50:05.181]  That's why they're calling for our arrest.
[00:50:05.562 --> 00:50:08.003]  That's why they're calling for Big Tech to be arrested if they don't submit.
[00:50:08.303 --> 00:50:14.205]  Because the globalists know their pedophile rings, their whole blackmail networks, their whole evil system is coming down.
[00:50:14.926 --> 00:50:18.288]  So keep hammering and keep getting the information out in the third dimension.
[00:50:18.629 --> 00:50:23.392]  Everybody should print off the vaccine inserts and go stand outside drugstores and warn people.
[00:50:23.472 --> 00:50:26.574]  It's time to get aggressive in the face of these monsters.
[00:50:26.854 --> 00:50:28.275]  Their house of cards is coming down.
[00:50:28.536 --> 00:50:29.837]  Mobilize and take action.
[00:50:30.137 --> 00:50:31.958]  Back to David Knight, host of the David Knight Show.
[00:50:32.298 --> 00:50:36.001]  Weekday mornings 8am to 11am and hosting the Alex Jones Show right now.
[00:50:37.247 --> 00:50:40.509]  All right, thank you Alex, and of course we're talking to Eric Peters.
[00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:50.457]  I wanted to keep him on a little bit longer because as Alex is talking about how they're controlling what you're allowed to see, what you're allowed to know about vaccines, about drugs, about anything.
[00:50:50.577 --> 00:50:51.478]  Pick the subject.
[00:50:51.698 --> 00:50:52.559]  They're going to control this.
[00:50:53.359 --> 00:50:59.104]  And we've already seen a technocracy asserting itself in control of our speech on the internet.
[00:50:59.804 --> 00:51:01.284]  Let me tell you, it's not going to stop there.
[00:51:02.205 --> 00:51:13.187]  They're going to shut down any information, any kind of health concerns that you have about 5G, any kind of privacy concerns that you're going to have about 5G, because this is a public-private partnership.
[00:51:13.607 --> 00:51:15.647]  It's a partnership between the corporations and the government.
[00:51:15.907 --> 00:51:17.008]  They've got an agenda.
[00:51:17.368 --> 00:51:18.428]  They've even told us what it is.
[00:51:18.468 --> 00:51:19.508]  We know what the agenda is called.
[00:51:19.568 --> 00:51:21.048]  It's called the UN 2030 Agenda.
[00:51:21.068 --> 00:51:24.129]  They say it's to save the environment, but it's to enslave you.
[00:51:25.009 --> 00:51:27.910]  What is going to be sustainable here is going to be their control over your life.
[00:51:28.942 --> 00:51:35.229]  And so when we look at these people who are now ruling our speech, they're going to be ruling our cities.
[00:51:35.709 --> 00:51:39.974]  These people who are covering up the information about vaccines are already covering up health concerns about 5G.
[00:51:41.801 --> 00:51:43.622]  And privacy concerns as well.
[00:51:44.062 --> 00:51:48.444]  And so that's why I think it's very important to take a look at this Cybertruck issue.
[00:51:48.784 --> 00:51:50.205]  The king of crony capitalism.
[00:51:50.805 --> 00:51:54.187]  The guy who has been the chief pitchman for the technocratic elite.
[00:51:54.767 --> 00:51:55.968]  Eric, thanks for holding.
[00:51:56.568 --> 00:52:01.951]  Are you aware that Elon Musk's grandfather was run out of Canada, essentially?
[00:52:01.991 --> 00:52:05.192]  He was arrested, put on trial, because he set up Technocracy Incorporated.
[00:52:05.212 --> 00:52:10.735]  They accused him of trying to overthrow the democratically elected government there with a technocracy.
[00:52:11.403 --> 00:52:12.524]  No, but I'm not surprised.
[00:52:12.544 --> 00:52:24.977]  You know, a lot of this is multi-generational that has been going on for decades, incrementally, which is quite something to contemplate, to think about how long-range the vision and the plan is of these people to achieve their ends.
[00:52:25.397 --> 00:52:26.078]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:26.218 --> 00:52:27.479]  His grandfather was Haldeman.
[00:52:27.539 --> 00:52:31.423]  He went there and had to leave, left after he beat the rap.
[00:52:31.483 --> 00:52:34.907]  He beat it out of town and went to South Africa.
[00:52:35.607 --> 00:52:42.935]  I wanted to mention something that I think will interest people listening to this broadcast and that I often harp on when I speak and when I write.
[00:52:43.396 --> 00:52:54.108]  If we take as a premise this idea that we have to have electric cars because they're going to save the earth, because we have this issue with carbon dioxide emissions, well, just for the sake of discussion, accept that.
[00:52:55.028 --> 00:53:04.613]  Then why is it that we are allowing gratuitously powerful, high-performance electric cars, which is all that Elon Musk makes, to be put onto the market?
[00:53:04.653 --> 00:53:20.622]  Nobody needs a ludicrous-speed electric car that gets to 60 in 2.8 seconds and that has to have a battery pack that's twice as large as what would be necessary for an A-to-B transportation module that ends up emitting, maybe not at the tailpipe but at the smokestack,
[00:53:21.422 --> 00:53:25.883]  A great deal more carbon dioxide than an internal combustion-powered economy car.
[00:53:26.423 --> 00:53:28.123]  And I think you and I both know the answer to that.
[00:53:28.143 --> 00:53:31.844]  It's because the elites are the only ones who are going to be having those cars.
[00:53:31.904 --> 00:53:33.785]  That's why they're building these high-performance cars.
[00:53:33.825 --> 00:53:36.645]  The rest of us will be... They're sovietizing the American marketplace.
[00:53:36.865 --> 00:53:37.185]  That's right.
[00:53:37.225 --> 00:53:50.508]  The idea is to get the vast majority of us, probably two-thirds or more of the population, out of personal cars and into ride-sharing or on the bus, while personal vehicles are for the party elite only, so to speak.
[00:53:51.008 --> 00:53:51.468]  That's correct.
[00:53:51.828 --> 00:54:03.531]  And you know, there's an article came out today talking about how, oh gee, this is kind of inconvenient that the Apple, that smartphones in general, not just Apple's phone, but smartphones in general, they have a very short life.
[00:54:04.311 --> 00:54:11.272]  And they use a lot of very, very toxic and very, very rare materials that can be very destructive to the environment to obtain them.
[00:54:11.672 --> 00:54:13.573]  And they don't have a good way to recycle them as well.
[00:54:13.613 --> 00:54:20.414]  So their smartphones are not really very green, but you know, the electric vehicles, as you pointed out many times, are just basically giant smartphones with wheels.
[00:54:20.854 --> 00:54:21.274]  That's right.
[00:54:21.995 --> 00:54:33.701]  It involves a great deal of things that are not so great for the environment when it comes to obtaining the raw materials that are necessary for a lithium-ion battery and then processing that and turning that into a battery.
[00:54:34.401 --> 00:54:43.466]  The environmental costs of that, if you want to look at it from that point of view, are far greater actually than those involved with a conventional internal combustion powered economy car.
[00:54:43.526 --> 00:54:45.807]  And there's another factor, and that's longevity.
[00:54:46.187 --> 00:54:47.908]  A typical new IC car
[00:54:48.788 --> 00:54:51.710]  We'll have a useful service life of 15 to 20 years or more.
[00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:56.414]  Especially if it was a diesel, which they are totally outlawing now.
[00:54:56.434 --> 00:54:59.716]  These electric cars are disposable at a much faster rate.
[00:54:59.736 --> 00:55:03.699]  You know, you typically have to get rid of it because the battery is just simply too expensive to replace.
[00:55:04.399 --> 00:55:11.885]  So you throw it away after 8 or 10 years, in effect, half the useful service life of an IC vehicle.
[00:55:12.285 --> 00:55:13.486]  How good is that for the environment?
[00:55:13.686 --> 00:55:14.348]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:14.368 --> 00:55:18.356]  We're going to talk more to Eric Peters, epautos.com when we return.
[00:55:18.456 --> 00:55:21.884]  Stay with us because this is about your freedom as well as your mobility.
[00:55:21.924 --> 00:55:22.866]  We'll stay with stay with us.
[00:55:23.749 --> 00:55:28.354]  We're talking to Eric Peters about the moves to take over our physical space.
[00:55:28.414 --> 00:55:35.582]  We know that they've already taken over social media, cyberspace, so now they're moving with things like the Cybertruck to take over our physical space.
[00:55:35.602 --> 00:55:45.412]  You know, it's kind of funny, Elon Musk lost, according to Forbes Magazine, they estimated that the fall off in stock after the fiasco of a demonstration of this new product.
[00:55:46.193 --> 00:55:46.834]  I think more than 6%.
[00:55:47.435 --> 00:56:02.470]  They said that would carve off about $768 million off of Elon Musk's fortune, and they rank him as the 41st richest person in the world.
[00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:06.714]  He's not as rich as Bloomberg, but you know, it's interesting, I think, Eric, that both of these guys
[00:56:07.622 --> 00:56:12.405]  ...have prospered selling this climate fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
[00:56:12.425 --> 00:56:15.468]  You know, they say the word of the year.
[00:56:15.748 --> 00:56:16.628]  Actually, it's two words.
[00:56:17.229 --> 00:56:20.031]  Climate emergency has been used so many times.
[00:56:20.051 --> 00:56:25.315]  100 times, used 100 times more this last year than the year previous.
[00:56:25.935 --> 00:56:29.438]  And these guys are pushing that fear, uncertainty, and doubt for their own personal profit.
[00:56:29.478 --> 00:56:31.119]  And of course, Bloomberg wants to take your guns.
[00:56:31.219 --> 00:56:32.560]  Elon Musk wants to take your car.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.041]  Your comment, Eric?
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:35.721]  Well, of course.
[00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:41.185]  And regarding Musk's worth, this is a man whose net worth, I think, is in the order of $24 billion.
[00:56:41.205 --> 00:56:41.725]  Yeah.
[00:56:42.106 --> 00:56:42.766]  Yeah.
[00:56:42.786 --> 00:56:46.349]  If he believes so strongly in his product, why isn't he investing his own money in it?
[00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:49.732]  Well, he might have bought back some of that stock the next day.
[00:56:49.752 --> 00:56:55.336]  You know, there's a degree of effrontery here that is almost paralyzing.
[00:56:55.817 --> 00:57:01.742]  On the one hand, you've got this mega billionaire who can't use his own money to fund his little car company.
[00:57:01.762 --> 00:57:04.564]  I've got no objection to him building his car company using his own money.
[00:57:05.064 --> 00:57:13.070]  But there's this effrontery of him using the government to force you and me to subsidize his little experiment with the electric car.
[00:57:13.431 --> 00:57:25.240]  And then there's the effrontery of the electric car itself as they exist, which is an indulgent toy for the virtue-signaling affluent, paid for by ordinary working people who can't afford them.
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:26.521]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:57:26.681 --> 00:57:31.005]  And let's talk a little bit about that virtue signaling, and let's talk a little bit about the P.T.
[00:57:31.045 --> 00:57:32.266]  Barnum aspect of this.
[00:57:32.906 --> 00:57:37.710]  Jalopnik is a, I put it in quotes as part of the car press.
[00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:38.771]  They don't really like cars.
[00:57:39.051 --> 00:57:40.112]  They like their environment.
[00:57:40.152 --> 00:57:41.113]  They really hate the cars.
[00:57:41.253 --> 00:57:45.096]  And they're usually cheering Elon Musk on, but they had this to say.
[00:57:45.397 --> 00:57:53.704]  They said, a truck that finally answers the question of what would a truck look like if it was designed on a Nintendo 64 and built in a country with zero ability to stamp steel.
[00:57:54.384 --> 00:57:56.345]  A question that nobody was asking.
[00:57:56.966 --> 00:57:58.626]  And so they pretty much hated on it.
[00:57:58.727 --> 00:58:01.208]  And then you had the issue of the smashed windows.
[00:58:01.308 --> 00:58:12.614]  And what I thought was most interesting about that was the response after the fact where Elon Musk put out a video saying, oh look, we pre-tested this and that's why it failed.
[00:58:13.335 --> 00:58:20.659]  Did you see that video where they had a blanket on the side of the car and then they tossed some steel balls at the window?
[00:58:21.562 --> 00:58:24.405]  I saw the one where the windows were cracked by the steel balls, yeah.
[00:58:24.665 --> 00:58:31.853]  Yeah, well then they put out another one and they said, well, you know, this is video of us testing it beforehand and I think that we weakened it, which is why it crashed.
[00:58:31.873 --> 00:58:33.895]  Of course, there's always an excuse, isn't there?
[00:58:34.536 --> 00:58:37.819]  Well, Twitter was hilarious because everybody called BS on that.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.082]  They said, well, first of all, why is the blanket there?
[00:58:40.162 --> 00:58:41.042]  It's there for a reason.
[00:58:41.202 --> 00:58:59.045]  I think it's there because you don't want us to see that you replaced the windows on that Cybertruck because earlier they had thrown these balls against the steel side and they had put dents on it so they had the blanket there and then many people pointed out that the window as well as the door were flexing which meant that it was not completely closed.
[00:58:59.085 --> 00:59:00.746]  There's that video right there we're playing it.
[00:59:01.286 --> 00:59:08.547]  That's the one that he put out many many hours ago and I said well you know I will just go with the one that he did before a live audience and not the one
[00:59:09.227 --> 00:59:09.667]  We're good to go.
[00:59:29.352 --> 00:59:38.099]  That would have caused any other car company to be run out of town by the so-called consumer advocates at Consumer Reports at all.
[00:59:38.139 --> 00:59:42.822]  If Toyota did what Elon Musk does, Toyota would probably be out of business.
[00:59:43.163 --> 00:59:46.685]  Yeah, actually, I think it was Motor Trend that took a ride in it.
[00:59:46.705 --> 00:59:52.990]  They said, well, you know, it had a lot of quality issues, but then of course, you know, this is a prototype, but all the
[00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:53.850]  We're good.
[01:00:09.448 --> 01:00:09.668]  We're good.
[01:00:25.636 --> 01:00:32.043]  And so, you know, you're talking about 600 to 1,000 pounds added to the weight of the car just for the side windows.
[01:00:32.604 --> 01:00:37.389]  That's not saying anything about the large front window and the very large back window that's on there.
[01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:41.273]  Not very believable that this actually has bulletproof glass.
[01:00:41.493 --> 01:00:42.274]  Certainly not the demo.
[01:00:42.970 --> 01:00:46.332]  No, but then again, rational considerations don't apply.
[01:00:47.132 --> 01:00:56.197]  Again, if we're talking about a vehicle that's going to save the planet, I fail to see how this extravagantly heavy, extravagantly wasteful vehicle is going to accomplish that.
[01:00:56.618 --> 01:01:05.202]  Well, it might be useful for the technocratic elite when the peasants are throwing steel balls at them as they drive through the cities that they own.
[01:01:08.359 --> 01:01:13.423]  You know, it's absolutely amazing that he can get on with this as we have talked about this in the past.
[01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:20.167]  You actually mentioned the fact that we have gone from safety glass in the front of a car, which has been there for a very long time.
[01:01:20.227 --> 01:01:28.854]  I remember my sister's Edsel was hit by a tornado and it took off our back porch and hurled it board by board at my sister's Edsel.
[01:01:29.713 --> 01:01:31.655]  That was the first time I was exposed to safety glass.
[01:01:31.995 --> 01:01:38.340]  Could not break through that glass even after it was shattered completely because it's got that laminated plastic in it.
[01:01:38.741 --> 01:01:43.225]  They did that because they wanted to protect people from going through the windshield if they have a head-on collision.
[01:01:43.725 --> 01:01:46.728]  And yet now we've got them doing that on side windows.
[01:01:47.208 --> 01:01:58.364]  And you know, quite frankly, I'm a lot more concerned here in Texas with floods that are going to trap me in a car with electric windows that cease to work once it gets flooded, and I can't crack my way out of those windows.
[01:01:58.424 --> 01:02:00.588]  I don't know why that is somehow a feature.
[01:02:00.608 --> 01:02:01.349]  It looks to me more like a bug.
[01:02:02.495 --> 01:02:06.856]  Well, and how about Teslas that have no exterior physical door pulls?
[01:02:07.316 --> 01:02:07.656]  Yes.
[01:02:07.676 --> 01:02:13.077]  And when the electricity stops because the battery's fritzed out or because it's underwater, you can't open the doors anymore.
[01:02:13.478 --> 01:02:17.358]  Yeah, we just had a lawsuit filed by the family of an anesthesiologist.
[01:02:17.418 --> 01:02:22.820]  They said, well, you know, he bought the Tesla because he wanted to save the environment and because he thought they were safe.
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:23.880]  And he got trapped.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:30.069]  And the Tesla, when it had a crash, and nobody, the people that were there, could not get him out of the car as it was catching fire.
[01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:34.416]  And he burned alive as everybody was watching him, to their horror.
[01:02:34.836 --> 01:02:36.199]  Seems like a safety defect to me.
[01:02:38.128 --> 01:02:42.592]  Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
[01:02:43.373 --> 01:02:44.233]  They're not going to come after him.
[01:02:44.253 --> 01:02:48.116]  And of course, they're not going to come after Uber either, because again, this is not just Elon Musk.
[01:02:48.477 --> 01:02:51.159]  This is the entire industry that they're pushing this.
[01:02:51.179 --> 01:02:57.564]  It doesn't matter if you run over a pedestrian, you know, they're going to say, well, sorry, move along, there's nothing to see here.
[01:02:58.044 --> 01:03:02.688]  And yet, if you are a Volkswagen with a diesel, something that, you know, you talk about some
[01:03:02.688 --> 01:03:05.509]  Something that's green, that's going to be durable and last a long time.
[01:03:05.529 --> 01:03:16.913]  You know, when I was looking at my post-apocalyptic vehicle, I was looking at diesels, thinking about how I could run them off of vegetable oil and things like that, because that's the thing that you can do with a diesel.
[01:03:17.273 --> 01:03:17.593]  That's right.
[01:03:17.633 --> 01:03:28.737]  Well, the untold story of the fiasco with Volkswagen was that they were on the verge of bringing into production a diesel-powered commuter car that would have averaged 80 miles per gallon and would have sold for about $18,000.
[01:03:30.137 --> 01:03:33.440]  I guess somebody needs to do a documentary and say, whatever happened to the diesel car?
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:34.861]  Remember, they did that with the electric car.
[01:03:34.881 --> 01:03:37.123]  You know, we can say, well, what's the conspiracy to shut down diesels?
[01:03:37.143 --> 01:03:38.924]  Well, we know what the conspiracy is.
[01:03:39.445 --> 01:03:40.846]  You and I have talked about that many times.
[01:03:41.166 --> 01:03:42.247]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:03:42.447 --> 01:03:46.871]  Eric Peters, you can find his reviews and his opinions on liberty and mobility.
[01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:50.194]  He does practical car reviews, not things like the Cybertruck.
[01:03:51.257 --> 01:04:00.782]  There's a reason that nutritional supplements are the fastest growing industry, not just in the United States, not just in Europe, but all over the world.
[01:04:01.783 --> 01:04:06.765]  Because the power of Mother Nature that God gave us is simply incredible.
[01:04:07.406 --> 01:04:11.448]  Now, a lot of viewers have noted that I'm more focused,
[01:04:12.554 --> 01:04:18.442]  That the broadcast have been better than they've ever been and a lot of people notice that I look younger and I've lost a lot of weight.
[01:04:18.583 --> 01:04:27.054]  Well, you remember just three months ago I said on air that when I do take the supplements from InfoWars Life,
[01:04:28.669 --> 01:04:40.993]  I lose weight, I have more stamina, more energy, more libido, and then I tend to get back in better shape, and then forget about the supplements, even though that's how we fund our operation, and I stop taking the majority of them.
[01:04:41.734 --> 01:04:52.677]  A lot of times, family comes to town for Thanksgiving, and we take the Lazy Susan off the dining table, and then I forget to put it back, and literally, six months later, I'm like, wait, I'm not really taking many of the supplements.
[01:04:53.858 --> 01:04:57.299]  It's when I religiously take our flagship products,
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.942]  So many great things happen.
[01:05:00.623 --> 01:05:17.340]  So I'm launching for this Black Friday week and as long as we're able to do this while supplies last, because one of these is not stocked up as much as it should be, I'm going to offer this special that I've named the Change Your Life Trifecta Pack.
[01:05:18.181 --> 01:05:18.341]  Now,
[01:05:19.878 --> 01:05:23.520]  We've got the great BrainPill Nootropic BrainForce Plus.
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:29.223]  We've got the great Triiodine with the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and two other types to help absorb it.
[01:05:30.704 --> 01:05:35.206]  That's X3 together with this product.
[01:05:37.032 --> 01:05:50.119]  I believe is one of our very best products and that I actually had our designers put together because products like this are the best-selling systems in the world right now and the fastest growing.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:56.703]  So let me show you what's in the 8-pack PowerStack AM PM system.
[01:05:58.663 --> 01:05:59.904]  Look at all of these packets.
[01:06:01.026 --> 01:06:04.069]  13 different pills that you take in the a.m.
[01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:05.270]  and the p.m.
[01:06:05.851 --> 01:06:08.814]  and then this way you don't forget.
[01:06:09.635 --> 01:06:15.261]  So that's why I'm calling this the change your life trifecta pack because if you take
[01:06:16.462 --> 01:06:23.788]  The morning pack and the evening pack, this alone is simply amazing and has changed my life.
[01:06:24.048 --> 01:06:38.459]  All the different supplements that are in it, what they do for you, what they do for your health, what they do as antioxidants, what the fish oil does, what the nootropic does, what the detox does, what the energy does, it's just insane.
[01:06:38.959 --> 01:06:43.783]  It's insane if you take these 13 pills a day, what mother nature has put together.
[01:06:44.043 --> 01:06:44.464]  Because listen,
[01:06:46.223 --> 01:06:51.994]  The top selling packs out there may have $10 of product in it that you take in a month.
[01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:53.958]  This has close to $30.
[01:06:56.331 --> 01:07:05.996]  We went out to the top manufacturer of organic supplements, and we have the Daytime Pack and the Nighttime Pack, and we put almost $30 a product into this.
[01:07:06.076 --> 01:07:10.039]  And so this special right now is at cost, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:10.479 --> 01:07:17.443]  You get the Brain Force Plus, you get the Survival Shield X3, and you get the 8-pack Power Stack, all
[01:07:18.403 --> 01:07:22.045]  For $59.95, that's at more than half off.
[01:07:22.285 --> 01:07:24.266]  This is more than a $120 value.
[01:07:24.746 --> 01:07:27.347]  When you put it all together, we are giving this to you at cost.
[01:07:27.427 --> 01:07:34.791]  Even though the X3 and the BrainForce Plus are really huge sellers, this seller that I thought would be our top seller has not sold well.
[01:07:35.311 --> 01:07:39.573]  But it's game-changing and the highest quality supplements you're going to find anywhere.
[01:07:39.873 --> 01:07:41.374]  No one that I know of has ever put out
[01:07:42.054 --> 01:07:44.116]  A daytime, nighttime pack with this type of quality.
[01:07:44.557 --> 01:07:45.638]  This will blow you away.
[01:07:45.738 --> 01:07:46.719]  This will change your life.
[01:07:47.079 --> 01:07:48.080]  All three of these together.
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:49.862]  It's incredible and it funds our operation.
[01:07:50.506 --> 01:07:51.086]  Welcome back.
[01:07:51.447 --> 01:07:54.869]  I was just talking to Eric Peters, talking about the environmentalism, the religion.
[01:07:54.929 --> 01:07:56.370]  It's now becoming secular religion.
[01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:59.832]  Of course, the Pope is making it literal religion.
[01:07:59.872 --> 01:08:02.173]  You know, he's talking about ecological sins and so forth.
[01:08:02.994 --> 01:08:14.881]  This goes back to a couple of years ago when he was bringing in people like John Schellenhuber, somebody who'd been pushing population control, radical population control, depopulation, for quite some time, working with Prince Charles.
[01:08:16.039 --> 01:08:18.041]  They had what they called the Earth League.
[01:08:18.842 --> 01:08:27.230]  They were proposing a planetary council to write environmental laws, a global court and so forth that they could haul you before.
[01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:28.391]  Yeah, they want a world government.
[01:08:28.412 --> 01:08:30.233]  They've got to have a world problem.
[01:08:30.594 --> 01:08:31.755]  This is what they're selling.
[01:08:31.795 --> 01:08:35.018]  And it's now become a world religion, a secular religion.
[01:08:36.099 --> 01:08:39.042]  As I was saying yesterday on my program in the morning, 8 to 11 here,
[01:08:41.138 --> 01:08:45.320]  You saw what happened with the Yale and Harvard football game.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.141]  You had the students go on and take the field at halftime.
[01:08:50.401 --> 01:08:55.683]  It wasn't like American Pie.
[01:08:55.703 --> 01:08:57.883]  It wasn't the marching band that refused to yield.
[01:08:57.903 --> 01:08:59.704]  The marching band got off and these guys went on.
[01:09:00.284 --> 01:09:02.365]  I said, you know, Yale and Harvard used to be seminaries.
[01:09:03.776 --> 01:09:12.301]  One of them was a Presbyterian seminary, I think, the other one was Congregationalist, and yet now they are both seminaries for this new religion, environmentalism.
[01:09:13.361 --> 01:09:16.423]  And they got on the field and they refused to leave as part of a protest.
[01:09:17.464 --> 01:09:31.772]  But I want you to think about the fact that as social media is banning anybody that challenges this information, you know, we call ourselves skeptics because I believe that science should always be skeptical.
[01:09:32.748 --> 01:09:40.572]  I believe that real science always challenges and continues to investigate what the conventional wisdom is.
[01:09:41.812 --> 01:09:47.735]  Any advance in science always comes by overturning what has become conventional wisdom.
[01:09:48.395 --> 01:09:49.736]  But they call you a denier.
[01:09:49.916 --> 01:09:51.296]  They don't call you a skeptic.
[01:09:51.336 --> 01:09:52.757]  You're not allowed to be called a skeptic.
[01:09:52.817 --> 01:09:54.178]  We call ourselves climate skeptics.
[01:09:54.198 --> 01:09:59.100]  They call us deniers because this is a religion to them and we are climate infidels, right?
[01:09:59.872 --> 01:10:00.553]  We're unbelievers!
[01:10:01.474 --> 01:10:02.254]  We're deniers!
[01:10:02.555 --> 01:10:03.816]  Deniers of the faith!
[01:10:05.097 --> 01:10:09.702]  And now, not only is social media banning any discussion of this, like they do,
[01:10:10.816 --> 01:10:15.057]  Health discussions or political discussions or discussions about abortion, whatever.
[01:10:16.057 --> 01:10:18.817]  They are going on the offensive.
[01:10:18.938 --> 01:10:21.058]  As Reuters is pointing out, the U.S.
[01:10:21.078 --> 01:10:28.479]  Supreme Court is now letting a very well-known climate quote-unquote scientist, I'll put that in air quotes for you, Michael Mann.
[01:10:28.499 --> 01:10:31.140]  This is the guy that came up with the hockey stick.
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:34.880]  And I just wish that we still had Don Rickles around because he would have said, hockey stick?
[01:10:35.421 --> 01:10:35.841]  Hockey stick?
[01:10:35.861 --> 01:10:36.921]  We got a hockey puck here.
[01:10:39.105 --> 01:10:42.450]  And he would have been sued by Michael Mann because you're not allowed to question him.
[01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:45.615]  He is one of the high priests of this world religion.
[01:10:46.456 --> 01:10:53.927]  You know, you're going to have the world court that's going to be laying down the new Levitical law.
[01:10:54.679 --> 01:10:57.400]  And these people are the high priests that are laying it out there.
[01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:01.701]  Michael Mann is somebody who is deeply involved in Climategate.
[01:11:02.421 --> 01:11:05.342]  And of course, that's just had its 10-year anniversary.
[01:11:06.163 --> 01:11:10.064]  If you remember, and maybe you don't, because it did get a little bit of attention,
[01:11:10.712 --> 01:11:14.953]  At first, but then the establishment system very quickly pushed back on that.
[01:11:14.973 --> 01:11:16.374]  We had emails surface.
[01:11:16.394 --> 01:11:27.097]  We had a lot of people who were working at the Climate Research Agency in East Anglia in the UK saying there's something wrong here and this needs to be exposed.
[01:11:27.117 --> 01:11:28.718]  And so people were trying to get that information.
[01:11:28.758 --> 01:11:30.098]  They stonewalled.
[01:11:30.278 --> 01:11:31.418]  They blocked that information.
[01:11:31.438 --> 01:11:33.639]  You know, kind of like Hillary Clinton did with her emails.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:39.481]  And then after a while, interestingly enough, there were a thousand emails that appeared on a Russian server.
[01:11:40.456 --> 01:12:01.068]  And we saw that these people within the university there in East Anglia, that was studying quote-unquote climate, they were emailing each other back and forth and saying, this looks really bad, the models are not working, the temperature is going down, even though the carbon dioxide is going up, we've got to find some way to hide this decline.
[01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:05.411]  And so they were admitting that their models had failed, they were conspiring
[01:12:06.892 --> 01:12:09.894]  To alter and to cover up the problems.
[01:12:11.055 --> 01:12:14.097]  And, you know, eventually, like I said, it appeared on a Russian server.
[01:12:14.137 --> 01:12:14.757]  So what did they do?
[01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:19.460]  They did exactly the same thing that Hillary Clinton did in 2016.
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.042]  They said, oh, this came from Russia.
[01:12:22.162 --> 01:12:23.022]  Who released this stuff?
[01:12:23.062 --> 01:12:23.563]  Don't look at that.
[01:12:23.703 --> 01:12:25.544]  Just look at who released this information, right?
[01:12:26.344 --> 01:12:29.526]  I mean, everything that came out about Hillary Clinton and the DNC and so forth, that was all true.
[01:12:29.687 --> 01:12:31.608]  Everything that WikiLeaks had was all true.
[01:12:32.657 --> 01:12:33.318]  But no, no, no.
[01:12:34.179 --> 01:12:36.121]  You've got to look at where this information came from.
[01:12:36.181 --> 01:12:36.762]  Don't look at it.
[01:12:36.782 --> 01:12:41.769]  Well, we're going to take a look at that when we come back, because now Michael Mann is suing again.
[01:12:41.869 --> 01:12:42.489]  We'll be right back.
[01:12:42.529 --> 01:12:42.950]  Stay with us.
[01:12:43.371 --> 01:12:43.791]  Welcome back.
[01:12:43.851 --> 01:12:51.260]  As I've been pointing out since President Trump got elected, as soon as he got elected, you had Barack Obama and his Attorney General Eric Holder.
[01:12:52.065 --> 01:13:02.149]  Get together and talk about how they could file a system of lawsuits because they had lost so badly at the ballot box.
[01:13:02.169 --> 01:13:10.272]  You know, the Democrats under Obama lost over a thousand seats in various offices throughout the country.
[01:13:10.773 --> 01:13:15.735]  And so what they could not win at the ballot box, they decided they would win in lawsuits.
[01:13:16.135 --> 01:13:18.336]  A good example is North Carolina, where I lived at the time.
[01:13:18.356 --> 01:13:20.977]  You know, in 2008, North Carolina went for Barack Obama.
[01:13:21.935 --> 01:13:28.439]  Two years later, they had buyer's regret, and they went solidly Republican.
[01:13:29.259 --> 01:13:35.743]  So much so, that for the first time since the Civil War, they had the Republicans in charge of both houses of the state legislature.
[01:13:36.981 --> 01:13:43.622]  And as 2010 was a year that they had the census, they were able to redraw the districting lines.
[01:13:44.263 --> 01:13:49.123]  Everything in the state had gone Republican in 2010 after voting for Barack Obama in 2008.
[01:13:49.824 --> 01:13:53.624]  The only thing that didn't change were the congressional seats.
[01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:56.065]  And that's because of gerrymandering.
[01:13:56.145 --> 01:13:59.286]  Gerrymandering is something that goes back to the foundation of the republic.
[01:13:59.606 --> 01:14:01.506]  It's something that both political parties have used.
[01:14:02.557 --> 01:14:13.362]  Barack Obama and Eric Holder decided it was something that they needed to change because now the advantage after they had lost so many elected seats, now the advantage was with Republicans.
[01:14:13.442 --> 01:14:16.104]  And so North Carolina was one of the states that they sued on.
[01:14:16.144 --> 01:14:20.186]  Now they subsequently, I believe, lost that at the Supreme Court level.
[01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:23.284]  I'm not sure if that case is finished yet.
[01:14:23.764 --> 01:14:27.806]  But we've seen this type of tactic being used by the Democrats in many different ways.
[01:14:27.906 --> 01:14:42.572]  As a matter of fact, we just saw in the recent elections in Virginia, we saw that George Soros poured way more money, I think it was, I forget now exactly how much it was, compared to what he had invested in the legislative
[01:14:43.433 --> 01:14:43.793]  I think so.
[01:14:59.955 --> 01:15:00.135]  Yes.
[01:15:19.275 --> 01:15:19.435]  Yeah.
[01:15:49.675 --> 01:15:52.256]  About ClimateGate in 2009.
[01:15:52.436 --> 01:16:01.059]  There's a thousand emails that showed that these people were conspiring at East Anglia University in the UK to conceal the fact that their climate models were garbage.
[01:16:02.279 --> 01:16:04.120]  And then conspiring to alter the data.
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:07.921]  Now one of the people that was involved in that at the time was Michael Mann.
[01:16:07.961 --> 01:16:10.402]  He was teaching at the time at University of Virginia.
[01:16:11.582 --> 01:16:13.683]  And he was corresponding with these individuals.
[01:16:14.915 --> 01:16:20.679]  I worked for a group that was trying to get access to his original data.
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:40.234]  And he refused to give it up, even though he was working at a public university, even though these emails were done on the university's email system, even though the conclusions that he drew from his research and the papers that had already been published, this is not going to mess up any of his research,
[01:16:41.244 --> 01:16:46.908]  But the publications that he had put out of his research, his conclusions, were used to craft public policy.
[01:16:47.769 --> 01:17:03.579]  In spite of all that, in spite of doing it while he was working for a public university, in spite of doing it on the public university's system, and in spite of the fact that it was used to craft public policy, he maintained that the data that supported his conclusions was his own personal private property.
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:05.080]  And we could not see it.
[01:17:06.201 --> 01:17:09.183]  And of course we wanted to see it because we knew what was going on with Climategate.
[01:17:10.603 --> 01:17:19.746]  And so we sued, but of course it's very vital, it's one of these things, you know, whenever the government's vital interests are at stake, you don't expect a fair trial.
[01:17:19.866 --> 01:17:21.326]  And so he prevailed in that.
[01:17:22.727 --> 01:17:35.431]  And he's now at the University of Pennsylvania, and so this newest suit is being brought by him, and it is an effort to, you know, we look at these people, they want to ban, they want to cancel, they want to sue.
[01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:37.659]  And that's what Michael Mann is doing.
[01:17:37.679 --> 01:17:41.202]  He's now suing the Competitive Enterprise Institute as well as National Review.
[01:17:42.363 --> 01:17:42.623]  Why?
[01:17:42.743 --> 01:17:43.824]  What is their crime?
[01:17:43.884 --> 01:17:44.825]  You will not believe this.
[01:17:46.146 --> 01:17:48.568]  The Competitive Enterprise Institute, Libertarian Think Tank,
[01:17:50.386 --> 01:17:56.168]  Says that it questions global warming alarmism, and they put that in quotes because this is a Reuters article.
[01:17:56.428 --> 01:17:59.389]  You know, these people, they just don't understand science.
[01:17:59.409 --> 01:18:03.371]  They question global warming alarmism, so they have to put that in quotes, right?
[01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:05.251]  Because they don't agree with that.
[01:18:05.871 --> 01:18:10.793]  Earlier, they say, Michael Mann over the years has clashed with groups and individuals who have sought to discredit his work.
[01:18:11.693 --> 01:18:13.254]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:18:13.654 --> 01:18:17.535]  Like the hockey stick, the thing that was used by Al Gore.
[01:18:17.555 --> 01:18:19.296]  Remember that inconvenient truth?
[01:18:20.564 --> 01:18:22.546]  Uh, his, uh, his convenient lie.
[01:18:23.306 --> 01:18:28.151]  We had a giant graph showing the projections of Michael Mann.
[01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:32.834]  You know, we're going to go along and we're going to, uh, uh, CO2 is going to increase.
[01:18:33.515 --> 01:18:36.978]  And then it and the temperature are going to go up exponentially.
[01:18:37.178 --> 01:18:38.419]  That's what they mean by the hockey stick.
[01:18:38.599 --> 01:18:43.664]  And he blew it up to the size of an entire wall and he got on a electric lift.
[01:18:44.761 --> 01:18:53.127]  And went up to dramatize that, and they used that then to propagandize students and schools, as they showed them that fake movie.
[01:18:54.088 --> 01:19:05.356]  And as I pointed out earlier in the program, we've now got USA Today wringing their hands that carbon dioxide and others, they call it greenhouse gases, have set a record high in the Earth's atmosphere.
[01:19:05.396 --> 01:19:06.977]  The sky is falling.
[01:19:08.218 --> 01:19:11.160]  And yet, it's not the sky that's falling, it's the temperatures that are falling.
[01:19:12.392 --> 01:19:14.554]  Temperature's going exactly the opposite direction.
[01:19:14.574 --> 01:19:16.035]  They're not going up exponentially.
[01:19:16.715 --> 01:19:18.216]  Even though we've had a massive increase.
[01:19:18.256 --> 01:19:19.978]  They say a massive increase in greenhouse gases.
[01:19:20.018 --> 01:19:20.758]  Oh, this is horrible.
[01:19:21.239 --> 01:19:22.459]  No, but the temperatures are going down.
[01:19:22.479 --> 01:19:23.620]  They've got to hide that decline.
[01:19:23.961 --> 01:19:25.662]  And that's what we're trying to expose about Michael Mann.
[01:19:25.682 --> 01:19:27.643]  But now he's got another issue.
[01:19:28.124 --> 01:19:32.527]  As he was being criticized by the Competitive Enterprise Institute and National Review.
[01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:58.167]  They said that former CEI fellow, that's Competitive Enterprise Institute, Rand Semberg, compared the investigations into man with then-recent national controversy over Jerry Sandusky, the pedophile that was coaching at the University of Pennsylvania, who was arrested in 2011 and convicted in 2012 of sexually molesting 10 young boys.
[01:19:59.441 --> 01:20:12.423]  And Rand Sinberg said at the time, quote, man could be said to be the Jerry Sandusky of climate science, except instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data.
[01:20:13.804 --> 01:20:18.745]  Now I look at that and I think that's pretty clever rhetoric, sarcasm, satire.
[01:20:19.405 --> 01:20:25.186]  And he makes it clear that he's not accusing Michael Mann of molesting children, just of molesting data.
[01:20:26.724 --> 01:20:29.087]  And I guess he concealed those crimes as well.
[01:20:29.127 --> 01:20:31.730]  He was certainly able to conceal them from the group that I was working with.
[01:20:32.271 --> 01:20:39.058]  In a later post on National Review's website, conservative writer Mark Stein quoted from Sinberg's article and referred to Mann's research as, quote, fraudulent.
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:42.783]  Well, now he's suing because of that.
[01:20:42.843 --> 01:20:43.724]  Can you imagine that?
[01:20:44.585 --> 01:20:45.286]  Can you imagine that?
[01:20:46.435 --> 01:20:52.097]  CEI later removed the Sandusky comparison, but the National Review refused to retract its post.
[01:20:52.157 --> 01:21:00.021]  Instead, it published a response from its editor with the headline, Get Lost, which is exactly what they should tell him.
[01:21:00.321 --> 01:21:01.581]  We have free speech.
[01:21:01.821 --> 01:21:04.122]  We should be able to debate.
[01:21:04.843 --> 01:21:05.623]  And let me tell you something.
[01:21:05.723 --> 01:21:12.786]  If anybody comes to you with quote-unquote science and tells you that it's settled, science is never settled.
[01:21:14.846 --> 01:21:19.788]  It is false if they cannot stand the scrutiny.
[01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:22.369]  And these people cannot stand the scrutiny.
[01:21:22.650 --> 01:21:28.832]  And yet, when we look at this, when we look at the fact that carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases, as they admit and they wring their hands, they are peaking.
[01:21:29.072 --> 01:21:32.534]  They're setting record amounts.
[01:21:32.614 --> 01:21:36.415]  And yet, we have the coldest winter in 100 years in the UK.
[01:21:36.776 --> 01:21:39.357]  A three-month sub-zero freeze hits Britain.
[01:21:40.373 --> 01:21:41.674]  What is the response of these people?
[01:21:41.714 --> 01:21:45.797]  Same people are wringing their hands, USA Today, says kids are at risk.
[01:21:46.677 --> 01:21:47.398]  Kids are at risk.
[01:21:47.958 --> 01:21:55.524]  We're damaging the health of the world's children with this carbon dioxide and global warming or cooling or whatever they've decided it is at the point.
[01:21:56.084 --> 01:21:58.025]  And Wired Magazine is doing the same thing.
[01:21:58.045 --> 01:22:07.352]  I tweeted out yesterday, Wired Magazine, a new report shows how climate change is disproportionately affecting women.
[01:22:08.453 --> 01:22:09.634]  And I tweeted that out and I said,
[01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:12.853]  Wired Magazine tells us the world is ending.
[01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:14.735]  Women and minorities are the hardest hit.
[01:22:15.695 --> 01:22:18.677]  That was actually very funny.
[01:22:18.977 --> 01:22:21.239]  Back in the day when Harvard had a sense of humor.
[01:22:21.259 --> 01:22:25.101]  Nobody at these colleges has a sense of humor anymore.
[01:22:25.621 --> 01:22:31.085]  Back in the day when Harvard had a sense of humor, when they had National Lampoon, they actually put out a satire article.
[01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:33.134]  World is ending tomorrow.
[01:22:33.594 --> 01:22:35.235]  Women and minorities, hardest hit.
[01:22:35.295 --> 01:22:36.736]  And that's what these people are selling you.
[01:22:37.336 --> 01:22:40.978]  First of all, they tell you that the world is ending, even though their climate models are abject failures.
[01:22:41.058 --> 01:22:45.200]  And then they tell you that women and minorities are the hardest hit.
[01:22:47.021 --> 01:22:48.322]  It's a climate emergency.
[01:22:48.862 --> 01:22:49.443]  We'll be right back.
[01:22:49.463 --> 01:22:49.883]  Stay with us.
[01:22:50.143 --> 01:22:50.643]  Welcome back.
[01:22:50.703 --> 01:22:53.685]  We talked earlier about Elon Musk, who wants to come for your cars.
[01:22:53.725 --> 01:22:56.867]  And of course, Bloomberg, no doubt about it, wants to come for your guns.
[01:22:58.347 --> 01:23:00.669]  And one of the most amazing things about his candidacy
[01:23:01.664 --> 01:23:08.331]  There's the fact that the Bloomberg organizations came out and said, well, we will not be investigating fellow Democrats.
[01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:10.153]  We will not be investigating Bloomberg himself.
[01:23:10.213 --> 01:23:13.296]  Instead, we will be investigating, however, President Trump.
[01:23:13.636 --> 01:23:14.797]  That is going to be fair game.
[01:23:15.819 --> 01:23:21.725]  In reply yesterday, the union that represents journalists at the Bloomberg publication groups
[01:23:22.603 --> 01:23:23.003]  We're good.
[01:23:41.552 --> 01:23:52.896]  And, of course, Bloomberg is one of the people who has the Bloomberg environment brought back population control as something that needs to be brought back.
[01:23:52.956 --> 01:23:55.017]  And, you know, we've got to reduce the number of people and so forth.
[01:23:55.737 --> 01:23:58.338]  Yeah, it's all about the environment.
[01:23:58.358 --> 01:24:02.459]  That's where they get their protection from, by selling that narrative for the government.
[01:24:02.679 --> 01:24:03.660]  Anyway, all these different groups.
[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:09.431]  Called the company's decision an effort to silence the company's reporters.
[01:24:09.471 --> 01:24:10.413]  Well, of course that's what it is.
[01:24:10.453 --> 01:24:13.560]  We're seeing silencing going on across the political spectrum.
[01:24:14.745 --> 01:24:24.472]  All of these technocratic billionaires, whether they're the people who run Facebook and Twitter and Google, or even Bloomberg Press now.
[01:24:24.532 --> 01:24:28.535]  It's not just social media, but it's actual old-style press.
[01:24:29.295 --> 01:24:36.961]  They're all basically gagging people, telling everybody what you can say, what topics you can cover, and what you can say about those topics.
[01:24:37.201 --> 01:24:38.662]  It's across the spectrum.
[01:24:39.844 --> 01:24:44.026]  Not just health or politics, but it's everything that's coming up.
[01:24:44.046 --> 01:24:56.490]  They said, quote, we are extremely alarmed by management's decision to silence the journalists that we represent at Bloomberg Industry Group, as well as the unrepresented journalists at Bloomberg News, wrote the Guild.
[01:24:57.231 --> 01:25:08.155]  The Guild believes that journalists should not only be allowed, but encouraged to thoroughly cover every single candidate as the profession demands in one of the most important elections in modern history.
[01:25:08.848 --> 01:25:09.548]  You would think, right?
[01:25:10.308 --> 01:25:10.828]  No, no, no, no.
[01:25:11.429 --> 01:25:13.569]  It's just like the investigation into President Trump.
[01:25:13.589 --> 01:25:25.031]  You have to understand if it's going to make any sense to you because I remember we had both the declassification of the phone call and then the complaint.
[01:25:25.051 --> 01:25:27.652]  I think it was two consecutive days when it came out.
[01:25:29.232 --> 01:25:35.513]  The press doesn't really cover what was actually released in those documents by President Trump right away.
[01:25:36.594 --> 01:25:37.794]  They came out during my show.
[01:25:39.062 --> 01:25:40.423]  The crew came in and handed me this stuff.
[01:25:40.443 --> 01:25:41.423]  I said, well, let's just read this.
[01:25:42.004 --> 01:25:43.744]  I went through and talked about it in detail.
[01:25:44.745 --> 01:25:45.405]  I said, well, that's it.
[01:25:45.745 --> 01:25:46.826]  There's absolutely nothing here.
[01:25:47.266 --> 01:25:48.387]  Well, that was a couple of months ago.
[01:25:48.427 --> 01:25:51.408]  And of course, they've been trying to invent something out of that ever since.
[01:25:52.989 --> 01:25:57.351]  But as soon as I saw it, I said, wait, this is, this guy didn't witness anything.
[01:25:57.371 --> 01:25:59.092]  This complaint, the guy didn't witness anything.
[01:26:00.305 --> 01:26:05.309]  I look at the transcript and I said, well, you know, the Ukrainian guy brought up corruption.
[01:26:05.389 --> 01:26:06.830]  He said, we're going to drain the swamp here.
[01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.451]  We've had a lot of corruption problems here.
[01:26:08.511 --> 01:26:09.491]  He brought that up first.
[01:26:11.113 --> 01:26:19.819]  And the complaint, it even talked about the timeline that would indicate that there were a lot of things that were happening on the Ukrainian side well before that phone call happened.
[01:26:20.699 --> 01:26:23.501]  Nevertheless, you know, they continue going on with that.
[01:26:23.661 --> 01:26:25.282]  And I said at the time, I said, well,
[01:26:26.539 --> 01:26:38.745]  Even though there's nothing here, you've got to understand that the principle on which the mainstream media, but I think a better way to label them, is the checkmark video.
[01:26:38.805 --> 01:26:43.868]  Because, you know, we've got Microsoft out there with its election guard, as well as its news guard.
[01:26:44.008 --> 01:26:45.909]  You know, news guard is built into its browser.
[01:26:47.230 --> 01:26:54.874]  And you have certain organizations, like the BBC, that would never lie to you about pedophiles, that would never lie to you about 9-11, they would never lie to you about anything.
[01:26:55.785 --> 01:26:57.786]  The BBC gets a checkmark.
[01:26:57.987 --> 01:27:05.752]  New York Times or ABC, no matter how many times they've lied or covered up or had to do retractions, they never lie to you about anything either.
[01:27:05.832 --> 01:27:07.193]  You know, you believe everything they say.
[01:27:08.053 --> 01:27:09.655]  And of course they are the checkbook media.
[01:27:10.415 --> 01:27:16.099]  No, the thing that you have to understand those people are going to be talking about is the fact that Democrats can never commit a crime.
[01:27:16.119 --> 01:27:21.583]  The only crime is to try to investigate them after they've committed the crime.
[01:27:22.223 --> 01:27:22.824]  We'll be right back.
[01:27:22.864 --> 01:27:23.224]  Stay with us.
[01:27:24.426 --> 01:27:31.448]  As you know, the establishment is trying to silence us and anyone else that wants to be free and promote American values, not just here but worldwide.
[01:27:32.408 --> 01:27:34.069]  And they're really trying to shut us down right now.
[01:27:34.109 --> 01:27:41.071]  But I have a special for you that runs through Black Friday week that is the best special we've ever offered for these three items together.
[01:27:42.111 --> 01:27:44.612]  And I'm calling it the Change Your Life Trifecta Pack.
[01:27:45.032 --> 01:27:46.753]  When I forget to take the supplements
[01:27:47.918 --> 01:27:50.099]  I'm sluggish, I gain weight, I'm not as healthy.
[01:28:18.279 --> 01:28:24.800]  And of course our best-selling brain force plus healthy nootropic all of this ladies and gentlemen
[01:28:25.899 --> 01:28:29.401]  is at cost together in this trifecta pack.
[01:28:30.041 --> 01:28:35.744]  Normally, again, with a supplement, if something has almost $30 a product in it, people would sell it for $100.
[01:28:36.684 --> 01:28:39.605]  If something has $10 a product in it, they sell it for $40, $50.
[01:28:40.546 --> 01:28:40.926]  Same thing.
[01:28:41.546 --> 01:28:47.489]  All of this is at cost together in this special for $59.95.
[01:28:48.009 --> 01:28:51.491]  That's more than half off, and these are game-changing.
[01:28:51.531 --> 01:28:53.932]  This will boost your brain in healthy, great ways.
[01:28:55.712 --> 01:28:57.972]  The Survival Shield X3 is the missing link.
[01:28:58.273 --> 01:29:00.333]  The opposite of fluoride, it's the good halogen.
[01:29:00.553 --> 01:29:01.813]  This is totally game-changing.
[01:29:02.193 --> 01:29:13.235]  And I'll assure you, if you take these two packs every day religiously, you're going to feel a huge difference in your energy, your stamina, your libido, the way you sleep, your clarity, your focus.
[01:29:13.635 --> 01:29:14.595]  This is game-changing.
[01:29:14.675 --> 01:29:16.416]  And then it funds the information war.
[01:29:16.936 --> 01:29:21.217]  So, truly, truly amazing and will change your life in those ways as well.
[01:29:21.497 --> 01:29:22.957]  Get yours today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:29:23.277 --> 01:29:23.657]  Welcome back.
[01:29:23.677 --> 01:29:34.602]  I was just talking about how the reporters, the journalists, the real journalists, are not too happy about the gag order that's been placed on them by the management of various Bloomberg Press.
[01:29:35.242 --> 01:29:41.865]  They put out their statement and said, well, we believe that journalists should not only be allowed but encouraged to thoroughly cover every candidate.
[01:29:42.865 --> 01:29:47.027]  And that is in response to the statement that came out from the company itself.
[01:29:47.087 --> 01:29:50.868]  We will continue our tradition of not investigating Mike.
[01:29:51.309 --> 01:29:51.809]  He's Mike.
[01:29:52.948 --> 01:29:53.708]  He's Mike to them.
[01:29:53.949 --> 01:29:54.989]  He's not even Michael.
[01:29:55.069 --> 01:29:57.350]  He's not even Mr. Bloomberg to you.
[01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:58.250]  No, he's Mike.
[01:29:59.031 --> 01:29:59.271]  Mike.
[01:29:59.531 --> 01:30:00.771]  Talk about crony capitalism.
[01:30:00.891 --> 01:30:02.012]  Talk about the crony press.
[01:30:02.912 --> 01:30:07.094]  We will continue our tradition of not investigating Mike and his family and his foundations.
[01:30:08.134 --> 01:30:09.355]  Why don't we just get a statement?
[01:30:09.415 --> 01:30:15.457]  I would like to see a statement like this from CNN and ABC and the rest of the establishment media about Hillary Clinton.
[01:30:15.537 --> 01:30:19.679]  We will continue our tradition of not investigating Hillary, Bill or their foundations.
[01:30:21.496 --> 01:30:24.577]  They're foundations of corruption, of multi-million dollars.
[01:30:24.697 --> 01:30:27.118]  I mean, I've had Charles Ortel on many times.
[01:30:27.378 --> 01:30:32.080]  He has investigated their foundation, found that they very clearly violated the law.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.681]  I mean, it's just an accounting issue.
[01:30:34.741 --> 01:30:36.521]  I mean, you don't even have to get into the skullduggery.
[01:30:36.541 --> 01:30:43.984]  You don't even have to get into the alleged murders and child trafficking and rapes and sexual assaults of these people.
[01:30:44.884 --> 01:30:49.486]  I mean, you can just look at the fact that they don't file any of their paperwork for their foundations.
[01:30:51.249 --> 01:30:53.210]  You don't even have to get into any quid pro quo.
[01:30:53.591 --> 01:30:55.852]  It's a criminal organization, by definition.
[01:30:56.052 --> 01:30:57.133]  Any accountant can do it.
[01:30:57.833 --> 01:31:00.174]  And Charles Hortel has done it many times.
[01:31:00.295 --> 01:31:02.296]  I've had him on my program many times.
[01:31:02.376 --> 01:31:10.221]  But they have a tradition of not investigating the Clintons or their foundation, just like Bloomberg has a tradition of not investigating Mike or his foundation.
[01:31:10.261 --> 01:31:12.282]  We'll extend the same policy to his rivals.
[01:31:13.342 --> 01:31:14.043]  Yes, we've noticed.
[01:31:15.996 --> 01:31:17.217]  And the Democratic primaries.
[01:31:17.277 --> 01:31:21.321]  We cannot treat Mike's Democratic competitors differently than we treat him.
[01:31:21.461 --> 01:31:26.285]  But they can treat President Trump differently than they treat the Democrats, of course.
[01:31:26.605 --> 01:31:26.806]  Right?
[01:31:27.526 --> 01:31:32.491]  We've already assigned a reporter to follow his campaign, just as we did when Mike was in City Hall.
[01:31:33.011 --> 01:31:40.077]  And in the stories that we write on the presidential contest, we will make it clear that our owner is now a candidate.
[01:31:40.157 --> 01:31:40.918]  Now think about that.
[01:31:42.682 --> 01:31:48.525]  Is that all these Democrats who are out there wringing their hands over President Trump and trying to dig in through his tax returns and everything?
[01:31:49.166 --> 01:31:50.467]  Talking about emoluments?
[01:31:52.468 --> 01:32:06.495]  And we've explained from the constitutional standpoint, I've had Richard Proctor who wrote a great commentary on the Constitution come on many times to talk about how emoluments has nothing to do with somebody who owns hotels prior to going in.
[01:32:06.535 --> 01:32:11.218]  But if these people are going to play that game, wouldn't you think that they'd want to look into the fact that
[01:32:12.293 --> 01:32:18.038]  Mike Bloomberg is owner of this big press organization, and he is immune to all of that.
[01:32:19.099 --> 01:32:20.039]  Oh no, but you know what?
[01:32:20.059 --> 01:32:21.721]  He's playing this very, very smart.
[01:32:22.541 --> 01:32:23.002]  Very smart.
[01:32:23.022 --> 01:32:25.824]  You know, Bloomberg is drafting.
[01:32:26.725 --> 01:32:29.607]  Kind of like Junior Johnson, the NASCAR hero.
[01:32:30.408 --> 01:32:30.868]  Remember that?
[01:32:31.048 --> 01:32:32.289]  I mean, that goes way back.
[01:32:33.210 --> 01:32:35.792]  Junior Johnson was very famous in the 1950s.
[01:32:35.832 --> 01:32:40.176]  He figured out how drafting works.
[01:32:41.206 --> 01:32:44.609]  And they did a movie about him in the 1970s, Last American Hero.
[01:32:44.729 --> 01:32:47.571]  They had Jeff Bridges play the part of Junior Johnson.
[01:32:48.732 --> 01:32:54.476]  But Junior figured out he had a car that didn't have as big an engine as his competitors did.
[01:32:55.317 --> 01:32:59.680]  And he realized that he could kind of hang in behind them.
[01:33:00.761 --> 01:33:09.308]  And not only did it help him to go faster because they were taking all the wind resistance, but they actually kind of pulled him along.
[01:33:10.643 --> 01:33:18.317]  And he would do that, you know, follow the leader, go around many, many times, and then right at the very end, he would slingshot around the guy and win the race, even though he had the slower car.
[01:33:19.499 --> 01:33:23.606]  Well, I think that's what Bloomberg is doing because, you know, he is avoiding
[01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:28.191]  And he's doing it in a very, very clever way.
[01:33:28.251 --> 01:33:33.974]  This guy didn't become, I think, the 15th richest man in the world, you know, by not being clever.
[01:33:33.994 --> 01:33:35.494]  I mean, he is a very clever individual.
[01:33:35.534 --> 01:33:36.415]  He may be evil.
[01:33:36.475 --> 01:33:45.058]  He may be having Machiavellian plans about how to control your life and how to make himself even richer and even more powerful.
[01:33:46.199 --> 01:33:48.040]  But he is very clever.
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:52.441]  See, he's not going to take any personal donations from anybody.
[01:33:52.461 --> 01:33:53.762]  No, no, no, no.
[01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:59.783]  I am just doing this to serve my country and to preserve the planet, he'll tell everybody.
[01:34:00.443 --> 01:34:08.826]  We've got to save lives by taking guns from people, not allowing you to defend yourself, not allowing you to make choices about your life.
[01:34:10.006 --> 01:34:12.827]  And so, you know, he's not going to collect any donations.
[01:34:14.307 --> 01:34:15.607]  I'm just going to fund this myself.
[01:34:15.667 --> 01:34:17.448]  It's going to be right out of my own pocket.
[01:34:18.359 --> 01:34:24.922]  Well, what that means is that he's not going to be eligible to participate in any of the Democrat debates.
[01:34:25.062 --> 01:34:27.343]  Now, I don't think he wants to participate in those debates.
[01:34:27.463 --> 01:34:32.646]  I think, just like Junior Johnson, he wants to hang back and draft in behind the leaders.
[01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:35.971]  And then slingshot out at the very last minute.
[01:34:38.433 --> 01:34:47.239]  And he can say, hey, they won't let me in the debates because, you know, I'm just, I just want to do this out of a sense of public service.
[01:34:47.259 --> 01:34:48.720]  I don't want any of your money.
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:50.341]  I've got more than enough money.
[01:34:50.361 --> 01:34:52.583]  I feel guilty about having so much money.
[01:34:52.603 --> 01:34:56.586]  I feel even guiltier than Elizabeth Warren hates me for having this much money.
[01:34:58.096 --> 01:35:04.361]  But since I'm not taking any donations, they've set up the rules for debate, and they won't let me on the stage.
[01:35:04.461 --> 01:35:05.061]  I'm sorry.
[01:35:05.142 --> 01:35:05.962]  I mean, I'd do that.
[01:35:05.982 --> 01:35:17.911]  I would explain my policies, and I would take the criticisms, but I'll just kind of sit back and let those clowns fight it out amongst themselves, and then the last minute, I will zoom around in the front.
[01:35:18.171 --> 01:35:21.174]  He's going to miss a half-dozen debates that were planned for next year.
[01:35:21.274 --> 01:35:22.575]  He's going to set out all the debates.
[01:35:23.564 --> 01:35:24.724]  He doesn't need to debate anybody.
[01:35:24.784 --> 01:35:33.006]  He's going to run tens of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars, telling his own story.
[01:35:33.967 --> 01:35:35.307]  He doesn't want to be scrutinized.
[01:35:35.347 --> 01:35:36.467]  He doesn't want to be debated.
[01:35:36.547 --> 01:35:38.708]  He's going to market this.
[01:35:38.748 --> 01:35:42.209]  And he's already started out with $34 million ad buy.
[01:35:43.269 --> 01:35:48.150]  Of course, he said he's going to run more than $100 million against President Trump.
[01:35:49.316 --> 01:35:55.199]  He has been the primary funder of the two biggest gun control groups out there.
[01:35:56.119 --> 01:36:00.381]  Every town and moms demand gun control or whatever they call themselves.
[01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:05.404]  He's been the biggest donor of one of them and he was the one who created the other organization.
[01:36:06.124 --> 01:36:07.205]  But make no mistake about it.
[01:36:08.188 --> 01:36:11.609]  This guy is pushing climate change for global government.
[01:36:12.509 --> 01:36:14.610]  He is not just coming to take the guns.
[01:36:14.730 --> 01:36:20.432]  He is pushing every aspect of the Democrat agenda.
[01:36:20.452 --> 01:36:21.852]  All right, we've got to take a break.
[01:36:21.872 --> 01:36:22.612]  We're going to be right back.
[01:36:22.652 --> 01:36:23.033]  Stay with us.
[01:36:23.653 --> 01:36:26.754]  We recently spoke all about this story because we think it's important.
[01:36:26.794 --> 01:36:29.515]  With Jonathan Steele, he's a former chief foreign correspondent for The Guardian.
[01:36:29.895 --> 01:36:30.655]  Here's the conversation.
[01:36:32.526 --> 01:36:33.549]  I don't want to overstate this.
[01:36:34.691 --> 01:36:40.765]  A lot of us, well, not a lot, some of us, this show, had suspicions from the outset that there wasn't much evidence that this had actually happened.
[01:36:41.166 --> 01:36:42.048]  What do we now know?
[01:36:43.652 --> 01:36:51.559]  Well, we now know from this whistleblower who prefers to call himself Alex, we know his real name and we've got proof that he did work at the OPCW.
[01:36:52.099 --> 01:37:02.948]  He was an inspector, one of the team of about nine people who went to Damascus and to Douma to pick up samples on the ground and to talk to witnesses and check the whole thing out.
[01:37:03.709 --> 01:37:05.830]  No, he took these samples.
[01:37:06.370 --> 01:37:14.054]  The main point is that chlorine gas degrades rapidly in the air, so that coming in two weeks later, you wouldn't find anything.
[01:37:14.474 --> 01:37:23.679]  But what you would find is that the gas can contaminate or affect other chemicals in the natural environment, so-called chlorinated organic chemicals.
[01:37:24.299 --> 01:37:30.262]  But the difficulty is that they exist anyway, in the natural environment anyway, and in water and so on.
[01:37:30.342 --> 01:37:32.143]  So the crucial thing is the levels.
[01:37:32.803 --> 01:37:41.392]  Were there higher levels of chlorinated organic chemicals found after the alleged gas attack than there would have been in the normal environment?
[01:37:42.032 --> 01:37:50.280]  And when they got back to the Netherlands, to The Hague, where the OPCW has its headquarters, the samples were sent off to designated laboratories.
[01:37:51.061 --> 01:37:53.703]  Then there was weird silence developed.
[01:37:53.763 --> 01:37:57.546]  Nobody told the inspectors what the results of the analysis was.
[01:37:58.287 --> 01:38:05.432]  And it was only by chance that the inspector found out that three weeks earlier the results had come in and they showed no difference at all.
[01:38:05.873 --> 01:38:17.302]  There were no higher levels of chlorinated organic chemicals in the areas where the alleged attack happened, where there's some suspicious cylinders had been found by opposition activists.
[01:38:18.002 --> 01:38:24.447]  And so it didn't seem possible that there could have been a gas attack because the levels were just the same as in the natural environment.
[01:38:24.688 --> 01:38:26.189]  Well, I'm confused by two points.
[01:38:27.170 --> 01:38:31.533]  So first, we were told, and again sternly lectured, that the U.S.
[01:38:31.553 --> 01:38:37.758]  government had absolute evidence that this gas attack took place.
[01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:45.024]  A. B. If OPCW knew that there wasn't actually evidence, why did it take a whistleblower to tell the rest of us?
[01:38:46.684 --> 01:38:50.788]  Well, on the first point, I mean, they just rushed, it was a rush to judgment.
[01:38:51.168 --> 01:38:59.575]  The missile strikes, which included British and French missiles as well as the American ones, happened about two or three days after the alleged gas attack.
[01:39:00.015 --> 01:39:02.958]  When no inspectors had been on the ground, there was no evidence on the ground.
[01:39:03.398 --> 01:39:07.162]  So it was just fabricated, as it were, the reason to go in.
[01:39:07.182 --> 01:39:08.883]  It was a rush to judgment.
[01:39:09.363 --> 01:39:11.685]  But the second point is that
[01:39:13.194 --> 01:39:23.363]  There was no real reason why Assad would make an attack at this stage because he was already capturing most of Douma and was about to capture the rest of it.
[01:39:23.703 --> 01:39:27.266]  He didn't need to go in for a chemical gas attack at that stage.
[01:39:29.127 --> 01:39:29.868]  We've been lied to.
[01:39:29.988 --> 01:39:30.969]  We've been manipulated.
[01:39:31.369 --> 01:39:32.210]  We knew it at the time.
[01:39:32.590 --> 01:39:33.931]  Thanks so much for coming on tonight.
[01:39:33.951 --> 01:39:34.612]  I appreciate that.
[01:39:34.652 --> 01:39:35.492]  It's a fascinating story.
[01:39:35.512 --> 01:39:36.333]  It's an important story.
[01:39:36.353 --> 01:39:39.696]  I hope it gets picked up by others apart from just this show.
[01:39:40.116 --> 01:39:40.997]  Jonathan Steele, thank you.
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:42.620]  Absolutely.
[01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:44.301]  Kudos to Tucker Carlson.
[01:39:44.341 --> 01:39:46.001]  Yeah, we were lied to at the time and we knew it.
[01:39:46.861 --> 01:39:49.862]  And, uh, yeah, I've been talking about this since it happened.
[01:39:49.902 --> 01:39:52.523]  I talked about it when it happened, as it was happening.
[01:39:53.383 --> 01:39:59.965]  First of all, what they just mentioned, the fact that, uh, you had, uh, Syria had absolutely no motivation to do that gas attack.
[01:40:00.745 --> 01:40:04.046]  They didn't have any motivation to do the one the previous year.
[01:40:04.066 --> 01:40:05.727]  You know, it was every March.
[01:40:06.704 --> 01:40:07.184]  I even said it.
[01:40:07.304 --> 01:40:08.505]  I said, beware of the Ides of March.
[01:40:08.525 --> 01:40:12.866]  We're going to have another false flag attack to try to draw us deeper into Syria.
[01:40:13.166 --> 01:40:17.248]  Every time it would come around to the Ides of March, it'd be, 8-2, Nikki!
[01:40:18.208 --> 01:40:24.711]  Because when Tucker Carlson said we were sternly lectured, that there was no question about that, you know who was sternly lecturing us?
[01:40:25.531 --> 01:40:26.411]  It was Nikki Haley.
[01:40:26.992 --> 01:40:28.772]  That darling of the conservative movement.
[01:40:29.693 --> 01:40:31.773]  At the time I called her Anne Theresa May.
[01:40:32.434 --> 01:40:33.654]  I called them the Valkyrie.
[01:40:34.835 --> 01:40:35.335]  You know, these...
[01:40:36.957 --> 01:40:38.618]  Nordic fictional characters?
[01:40:38.658 --> 01:40:39.379]  Yeah, that's what they are.
[01:40:39.419 --> 01:40:40.640]  They're fictional characters, alright.
[01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:47.144]  But, you know, these warlike women who, in Norse mythology, they were the ones who decided who was going to live and die.
[01:40:47.945 --> 01:40:49.606]  And that was Nikki Haley and Theresa May.
[01:40:50.767 --> 01:40:54.029]  And we had had that situation every year.
[01:40:54.289 --> 01:40:54.830]  Every year.
[01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:56.391]  Around March.
[01:40:56.411 --> 01:40:57.612]  It was the third time that they had done it.
[01:40:57.652 --> 01:40:59.753]  This time, they sexed it up.
[01:41:00.654 --> 01:41:03.876]  They threw in another gas attack in the UK.
[01:41:04.617 --> 01:41:06.018]  The one against Skripal.
[01:41:07.059 --> 01:41:08.700]  I talked about that at the time.
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:15.183]  And immediately after that attack, there was a UK journalist, Robert Fisk, who spoke the language of the people.
[01:41:15.223 --> 01:41:16.484]  He went there, he interviewed people.
[01:41:16.504 --> 01:41:24.007]  You know, we had the White Hats, an organization that's funded by NATO and the United States.
[01:41:24.027 --> 01:41:28.049]  They get almost all their funding from the US and NATO.
[01:41:29.009 --> 01:41:32.031]  Robert Fisk went there and he talked to doctors.
[01:41:32.431 --> 01:41:34.052]  We reported on this as it was happening.
[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:36.220]  This is nothing new.
[01:41:36.281 --> 01:41:37.261]  That was a year and a half ago.
[01:41:38.481 --> 01:41:49.946]  And the doctors told him, they said, yeah, it's such an intense bombing campaign as they were, you know, clearing out these areas of our ISIS allies.
[01:41:49.986 --> 01:41:51.427]  That's the other aspect of this, of course.
[01:41:51.447 --> 01:41:58.530]  You know, ISIS was working for our government as part of our surrogates for regime change.
[01:41:58.950 --> 01:42:03.152]  They said it was such an intense bombing campaign that people were suffocating from the dust
[01:42:04.967 --> 01:42:13.231]  And they were being brought in to be treated and he said one of the white hats came in and screamed, it's a chemical attack, right?
[01:42:14.052 --> 01:42:18.034]  And he said everybody started panicking and everybody started pouring water on themselves and so forth.
[01:42:18.074 --> 01:42:22.276]  He said it was simply that guy scaring everybody.
[01:42:22.316 --> 01:42:28.059]  And so Robert Fisk, as a journalist, went to talk to the white helmets and guess what?
[01:42:28.079 --> 01:42:28.799]  They'd all cleared out.
[01:42:29.731 --> 01:42:32.072]  Nobody would talk to him.
[01:42:32.092 --> 01:42:34.513]  Yeah, it was a lie from the get-go.
[01:42:34.913 --> 01:42:38.054]  And it's not just one OPCW whistleblower.
[01:42:38.254 --> 01:42:38.815]  It's now two.
[01:42:39.675 --> 01:42:49.399]  Not only do you have the guy who went there, and I reported on this weeks ago, not only is it the guy who went there and said, I measured the chemical contaminants and there was nothing.
[01:42:50.319 --> 01:42:54.481]  There was no more of this particular gas there than there was anywhere else in Syria.
[01:42:56.018 --> 01:42:58.622]  But it's also another guy who looks at armaments.
[01:42:58.942 --> 01:43:02.888]  And he said, no, that aspect of it was a lie as well.
[01:43:04.190 --> 01:43:06.433]  And then there's the lie in the UK itself.
[01:43:07.875 --> 01:43:11.941]  Just a few miles from the UK's chemical weapons facility there, Porton Down.
[01:43:12.856 --> 01:43:21.601]  You had a double, or I should say maybe a triple agent, Skripal and his daughter, who were allegedly poisoned with Novichok.
[01:43:21.621 --> 01:43:28.244]  This is a nerve gas that is seven times more potent than our own VX nerve gas.
[01:43:29.385 --> 01:43:32.146]  And we were told, it's absolutely certain, that this was Novichok.
[01:43:33.667 --> 01:43:36.629]  They immediately announced that, that it was Novichok.
[01:43:37.793 --> 01:43:43.555]  And you want to talk about a false flag attack, you want to talk about how we were lied to and we pointed this out from the very beginning.
[01:43:43.695 --> 01:43:52.058]  We didn't, you know, we suspected that this other one was false and Duma because we'd had that happen at least two times before.
[01:43:53.378 --> 01:44:03.862]  But immediately you could see the fact that you had these chemical, these guys in the full hazmat suits that were there at the bench where they found Skripal and his daughter.
[01:44:05.103 --> 01:44:15.007]  And, uh, standing around, they weren't full, you know, chemical weapon protection suits, and yet standing around them were guys who were just, you know, dressed like I am or whatever.
[01:44:15.027 --> 01:44:17.068]  No protection whatsoever.
[01:44:17.088 --> 01:44:20.009]  Uh, but it was actually worse than that.
[01:44:21.058 --> 01:44:27.222]  Because, as I said, it's seven times, Novichok is seven times more potent than our own VX nerve gas.
[01:44:27.802 --> 01:44:31.504]  And as Vladimir Putin laughed and said, if it had been Novichok, they'd all be dead.
[01:44:31.784 --> 01:44:35.406]  You had a nurse who worked on the two of them for a half hour.
[01:44:35.826 --> 01:44:37.748]  She said they had opioid-like symptoms.
[01:44:37.788 --> 01:44:39.969]  And you want to talk about an undegraded sample?
[01:44:41.069 --> 01:44:42.670]  Yeah, we'll talk about that when we come back.
[01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:43.771]  One more thing to say about that.
[01:44:43.791 --> 01:44:46.092]  And we're going to talk about the history of Thanksgiving.
[01:44:46.112 --> 01:44:46.473]  Stay with us.
[01:44:46.493 --> 01:44:46.993]  We'll be right back.
[01:44:47.625 --> 01:44:48.025]  Welcome back.
[01:44:48.045 --> 01:44:55.531]  We played Tucker Carlson talking to an individual explaining how we have the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, OPCW.
[01:44:55.571 --> 01:44:56.852]  We have whistleblowers.
[01:44:57.653 --> 01:45:02.276]  Not just one, as the individual was talking about, but there's actually been two, at least.
[01:45:03.157 --> 01:45:10.223]  And then of course we had an investigative journalist on the scene right away, Robert Fisk, saying that this is a lie that was put out by the White Helmets.
[01:45:11.271 --> 01:45:18.557]  But at the time we had Nikki Haley, Tucker didn't name her, but he said, yeah, we were sternly lectured that this was what was going on.
[01:45:18.577 --> 01:45:24.322]  Nothing, we cannot doubt this, even though there was absolutely no motivation from the Syrians to do this.
[01:45:24.382 --> 01:45:28.445]  As a matter of fact, they had exactly the opposite motivation to do that.
[01:45:29.546 --> 01:45:39.375]  But we were told immediately that, no, this was something that was a narrative that began as a white helmet, one of these people funded by
[01:45:40.495 --> 01:45:43.337]  NATO said that it was a gas attack.
[01:45:44.578 --> 01:45:50.201]  But as the individual said, you know, looked at this and of course this chemical degrades very quickly.
[01:45:51.362 --> 01:45:57.206]  That's a part of the narrative that's very important about the alleged Skripal poisoning.
[01:45:58.347 --> 01:46:01.569]  And I say alleged because he was poisoned with something.
[01:46:03.025 --> 01:46:07.547]  She just wasn't poisoned with Novichok, because as Vladimir Putin laughed, he said, that I'll be dead.
[01:46:07.787 --> 01:46:08.027]  Come on.
[01:46:08.128 --> 01:46:10.449]  You know, immediately, you know, we got, hey, this guy's sick.
[01:46:10.489 --> 01:46:11.009]  He's a spy.
[01:46:11.049 --> 01:46:11.709]  He was poisoned.
[01:46:11.829 --> 01:46:12.369]  Russia did it.
[01:46:12.630 --> 01:46:13.750]  They did it because of Syria.
[01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:15.331]  They did it with Novichok.
[01:46:17.232 --> 01:46:23.394]  And as I said, as we're going to break, you had a doctor who worked on Skripal and his daughter for a half hour.
[01:46:23.474 --> 01:46:24.495]  She would have been dead as well.
[01:46:26.153 --> 01:46:29.776]  They show up later, you know, they make a big show of having the hazmat suits and so forth.
[01:46:30.837 --> 01:46:35.921]  They did not send any samples of that alleged Novichok attack.
[01:46:36.121 --> 01:46:39.944]  They did not send any of that to an OPCW lab for several months.
[01:46:41.665 --> 01:46:42.426]  Several months.
[01:46:43.547 --> 01:46:55.215]  When they did, the Swiss lab, and there's only about a half dozen labs that are authorized to do chemical analysis for the OPCW, the Swiss lab that did the analysis said, well, what we found was
[01:46:56.383 --> 01:46:59.164]  BZ, or as they said in the UK, BZED.
[01:47:00.204 --> 01:47:03.906]  It is a Class 2 chemical contaminant.
[01:47:04.026 --> 01:47:05.446]  They have three different classes.
[01:47:06.406 --> 01:47:13.469]  The most, the number one classification are things that are designed as a weapon and they have no other use.
[01:47:14.649 --> 01:47:19.530]  Class II were things that have industrial uses, let's say, like in the particular case of BZ.
[01:47:20.170 --> 01:47:23.811]  It is something that is used, and I think it's in dry cleaning.
[01:47:23.971 --> 01:47:27.812]  I'm going from memory now because it's been so long since I talked about all this stuff.
[01:47:29.332 --> 01:47:34.233]  But anyway, BZ is an industrial chemical.
[01:47:35.313 --> 01:47:40.654]  It's not even used by Russia in any kind of industrial chemistry.
[01:47:40.974 --> 01:47:42.315]  But it can also be used as a weapon.
[01:47:42.355 --> 01:47:43.035]  It's very dangerous.
[01:47:44.339 --> 01:47:50.482]  But it produces opioid-like symptoms, which is what the doctor who worked on Skripal and his daughter for a half hour said.
[01:47:50.502 --> 01:47:52.864]  He said, I thought they were having an opioid overdose.
[01:47:54.104 --> 01:47:55.125]  And of course, they didn't die.
[01:47:55.605 --> 01:47:56.546]  She didn't die.
[01:47:57.846 --> 01:47:59.787]  And then what they said was even more curious.
[01:47:59.827 --> 01:48:07.952]  And it was almost like the Swiss lab was kind of, you know, they don't want to burn their bridges with the OPCW, but they kind of threw a little bit of a hint in there.
[01:48:07.972 --> 01:48:10.673]  And they said, we found predominantly BZ, BZ,
[01:48:13.090 --> 01:48:20.192]  And we found a small, undegraded sample of Novichok.
[01:48:22.112 --> 01:48:27.354]  Now, this was several months, it was four or five months after the alleged poisoning.
[01:48:28.454 --> 01:48:29.634]  It would have been degraded.
[01:48:29.654 --> 01:48:39.677]  And so what they were doing was they were telling the public, even though very few of us picked up on it, they were telling us that that Novichok had been added after the fact.
[01:48:40.979 --> 01:48:41.499]  After the fact.
[01:49:10.836 --> 01:49:16.277]  And we look at how the establishment there, many people have said, you know, these are people that were Obama holdovers.
[01:49:17.358 --> 01:49:20.119]  These are people that were brought in by the Obama administration.
[01:49:20.179 --> 01:49:25.680]  They put a social justice warrior bent on the Department of Defense.
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:31.402]  And this was petty, vindictive, as Gallagher's lawyers had said.
[01:49:31.422 --> 01:49:35.323]  And I'm glad that President Trump pulled that back.
[01:49:35.923 --> 01:49:36.583]  He did the right thing.
[01:49:38.076 --> 01:49:41.859]  President Trump needs to step up and do the right thing for Roger Stone as well.
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:45.242]  You know, Tucker Carlson, we played that clip of the OPCW.
[01:49:45.262 --> 01:49:46.403]  I played the entire clip.
[01:49:46.903 --> 01:49:56.190]  Tucker Carlson talking, contrasting the difference between the way Jeffrey Epstein was treated and the way Roger Stone was treated.
[01:49:57.231 --> 01:49:59.733]  You know, when they arrested Jeffrey Epstein,
[01:50:01.005 --> 01:50:02.285]  They were very deferential to him.
[01:50:02.325 --> 01:50:05.586]  They didn't do a big televised display.
[01:50:05.606 --> 01:50:07.367]  They didn't call up CNN in advance.
[01:50:08.027 --> 01:50:09.848]  They didn't go in with guns drawn.
[01:50:09.888 --> 01:50:12.769]  They gave him a call and said, would you like to turn yourself in?
[01:50:12.849 --> 01:50:13.189]  Oh, yes.
[01:50:13.249 --> 01:50:18.670]  And then the judge says, oh, let's move your trial to another jurisdiction so the press doesn't find out about this.
[01:50:18.711 --> 01:50:19.211]  Let's do that.
[01:50:20.351 --> 01:50:22.372]  And of course, he had the very best lawyers.
[01:50:22.412 --> 01:50:24.232]  He had lawyers like Alan Dershowitz.
[01:50:25.273 --> 01:50:27.253]  He had lawyers like Ken Starr.
[01:50:27.833 --> 01:50:29.334]  Ken Starr, the guy who
[01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:33.972]  Evidently, he couldn't find anything in the Clinton's history.
[01:50:33.992 --> 01:50:38.435]  He couldn't find any evidence to support whitewater scandals.
[01:50:38.475 --> 01:50:42.857]  He couldn't find any evidence to support the cattle futures stuff.
[01:50:42.877 --> 01:50:56.525]  He couldn't find any evidence to support what all these women, Juanita Broderick, Kathleen Willey, Paula Jones, all these people were saying about how President Clinton had violently assaulted them, sexually assaulted and raped them.
[01:50:56.645 --> 01:51:00.648]  No, those women were called bimbos, trailer trash by Hillary Clinton.
[01:51:03.055 --> 01:51:03.655]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:51:03.715 --> 01:51:09.177]  And by the people like... What was her name?
[01:51:11.138 --> 01:51:17.340]  It was when we had the back and forth about the Supreme Court nomination.
[01:51:17.861 --> 01:51:18.661]  Anita Hill.
[01:51:18.681 --> 01:51:19.361]  I believe Anita Hill.
[01:51:19.381 --> 01:51:19.781]  Remember that?
[01:51:20.021 --> 01:51:21.102]  Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill?
[01:51:21.882 --> 01:51:24.983]  Alleging that Clarence Thomas had made some inappropriate remarks to her?
[01:51:25.183 --> 01:51:26.224]  Oh, shame on him.
[01:51:28.545 --> 01:51:32.206]  Nothing like what was alleged about Bill Clinton.
[01:51:33.257 --> 01:51:35.819]  And yet, Ken Starr just looked the other way with all that.
[01:51:36.579 --> 01:51:39.141]  He had to do something, however, about the purge recharge.
[01:51:39.181 --> 01:51:54.511]  I can just imagine when one of his assistants brought him the blue dress, the blue dress that you, you know, see Bill Clinton wearing in the portrait that's in Jeffrey Epstein's living quarters, you know, sitting there in blue dress, smirking at the viewer.
[01:51:55.484 --> 01:52:01.326]  I can imagine when they brought the blue dress in and said, you know, we have this particular stain and it shows that the president has lied under oath.
[01:52:01.366 --> 01:52:05.186]  I can just imagine Ken Starr going, oh man, we're going to have to do something about that.
[01:52:05.206 --> 01:52:05.907]  I can't avoid that.
[01:52:05.947 --> 01:52:07.687]  I'm going to have to bring up charges about that.
[01:52:08.447 --> 01:52:11.188]  Because Ken Starr was the lawyer for Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:52:11.208 --> 01:52:13.809]  Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz got Jeffrey Epstein off.
[01:52:14.009 --> 01:52:15.549]  He basically got Bill Clinton off.
[01:52:15.929 --> 01:52:18.810]  And he tried to get his football players at Baylor University off.
[01:52:19.875 --> 01:52:23.397]  So President Trump, you know, when you pardon the turkey, think about Roger Stone.
[01:52:23.437 --> 01:52:27.639]  Maybe you could extend a little bit of grace to him and do the right thing.
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:35.344]  Because he's being politically persecuted because his crime was to support you.
[01:52:36.784 --> 01:52:37.425]  To support you.
[01:52:38.745 --> 01:52:39.386]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:52:39.406 --> 01:52:41.727]  You talk about the fact that, you know, lying to Congress.
[01:52:43.008 --> 01:52:45.189]  It's kind of like taking coals to Newcastle, isn't it?
[01:52:45.549 --> 01:52:46.410]  If that were even true.
[01:52:47.298 --> 01:52:53.200]  We had James Clapper, who lied under oath to the American people, looked us straight in the eye and said, I'm not surveilling you.
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:56.001]  And they never did anything about it.
[01:52:56.181 --> 01:52:57.501]  Republican nor Democrat.
[01:52:57.822 --> 01:53:01.863]  They let the statute of limitations expire on his crime of perjury.
[01:53:02.823 --> 01:53:09.305]  You know, as I pointed out, Thanksgiving is coming up and I want to talk a little bit about what the teachers are doing.
[01:53:09.345 --> 01:53:10.686]  We have civics teachers.
[01:53:11.698 --> 01:53:12.118]  We're good to go.
[01:53:33.342 --> 01:53:38.385]  You could talk about it as a lesson in economics and political organization.
[01:53:38.545 --> 01:53:42.987]  You know, private property and individual responsibility versus socialism and communism.
[01:53:43.007 --> 01:53:43.767]  There's a story there.
[01:53:44.768 --> 01:53:47.970]  You could talk about peace and cooperation between different peoples.
[01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:50.591]  You know, that's a message of merging cultures.
[01:53:50.651 --> 01:53:59.696]  It used to be a part of the core that we tried to impart to our students about the melting pot of America, how we brought together the best of different cultures.
[01:54:01.407 --> 01:54:04.388]  Or you could teach something like white people are evil.
[01:54:05.508 --> 01:54:10.709]  That's exactly what the civics professors are talking about teaching your kids.
[01:54:10.769 --> 01:54:11.369]  We'll be right back.
[01:54:11.409 --> 01:54:11.829]  Stay with us.
[01:54:12.490 --> 01:54:19.431]  There are a lot of men out there that say when push comes to shove and when America is fighting for its life against tyrants that they're gonna stand up and do something.
[01:54:20.531 --> 01:54:24.172]  Well a lot of those men have supported this broadcast and so you have done something.
[01:54:24.192 --> 01:54:27.313]  You've done a lot of other things as well like take care of your family and
[01:54:28.234 --> 01:54:28.474]  I don't know.
[01:54:43.766 --> 01:54:51.512]  We have got all these powerful megacorporations and all these different criminal groups desperately trying to shut us down right now because they're scared.
[01:54:51.813 --> 01:55:02.621]  We have analyzed the globalist attack profile, we know how to defeat them, and we're mobilizing not just Americans but people all over the world to say no to globalism and no to the satanic New World Order.
[01:55:02.641 --> 01:55:04.103]  And that's really what it is.
[01:55:04.203 --> 01:55:06.384]  And so, as everything we've warned of,
[01:55:07.145 --> 01:55:10.268]  Is confirmed, our credibility goes up and up and up.
[01:55:10.688 --> 01:55:13.931]  That's why they need us off the air desperately.
[01:55:14.411 --> 01:55:17.874]  So they can send a message to everybody else that you better keep your mouth shut.
[01:55:18.394 --> 01:55:20.776]  So now is the time to step up to the plate.
[01:55:21.357 --> 01:55:23.579]  Now is the time to decide where you're going to be in history.
[01:55:24.281 --> 01:55:30.704]  Because not just our country, but our species and our children need good men to come to the aid of humanity and good women as well.
[01:55:31.244 --> 01:55:34.766]  So I want to ask everybody out there to recommit in the information war.
[01:55:34.886 --> 01:55:35.846]  You are so powerful.
[01:55:36.346 --> 01:55:48.992]  To spread the word about InfoWars.com forward slash show and Bandot video and to realize the funding of our operation is absolutely paramount and only by you buying the products at InfoWars.com can we fund the operation.
[01:55:49.372 --> 01:56:02.526]  So do your Christmas shopping there, and get your supplements there, and get your coffee there, and get your protein bars there, because they're all excellent, they're high quality, and they make this operation absolutely viable into the future.
[01:56:02.566 --> 01:56:04.688]  Without you, they're going to win.
[01:56:04.768 --> 01:56:06.730]  But if you take action, we're going to win together.
[01:56:06.951 --> 01:56:09.213]  So I thank you for your support, and I salute you.
[01:56:09.433 --> 01:56:10.795]  So keep doing what you're doing.
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:14.522]  Alright, welcome back in this last segment.
[01:56:14.542 --> 01:56:18.184]  I want to talk a little bit about Thanksgiving and what your children are going to be taught from here on out.
[01:56:18.284 --> 01:56:19.946]  It's going to be very different than what you were taught.
[01:56:20.726 --> 01:56:22.808]  It's going to be very different than what I taught my children.
[01:56:22.908 --> 01:56:24.789]  I homeschooled our kids.
[01:56:25.610 --> 01:56:31.154]  But I got to say that Thanksgiving was my favorite lesson to go over because it was so rich in so many different ways.
[01:56:32.435 --> 01:56:36.338]  But as I said before, you know, you can make it a lesson about economics and political organization.
[01:56:36.358 --> 01:56:38.360]  You can make it a lesson about cooperation.
[01:56:39.173 --> 01:56:40.974]  About peace between different people?
[01:56:41.275 --> 01:56:43.376]  About the melting pot that is America?
[01:56:44.037 --> 01:56:46.078]  All of that was there at the beginning.
[01:56:46.939 --> 01:56:48.800]  You could teach the providence of God.
[01:56:50.021 --> 01:56:54.024]  You could talk about His protection through hard times and through persecution.
[01:56:54.845 --> 01:56:57.827]  About His love and power to all nations, right?
[01:56:57.847 --> 01:57:01.029]  Or, you could teach that white people are evil.
[01:57:01.149 --> 01:57:01.910]  That they're invaders.
[01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:07.394]  That they and their culture, their system of law are evil and must be purged from our society.
[01:57:08.939 --> 01:57:11.361]  What lesson do you think is going to be taught in schools?
[01:57:11.741 --> 01:57:13.142]  I'm afraid it's the last lesson.
[01:57:13.882 --> 01:57:24.809]  That's the one that's going to be taught in our government schools because we now have, if you look at Education Week, as Thanksgiving approaches, quote-unquote, unlearning history continues.
[01:57:26.050 --> 01:57:35.816]  And they say, not too long ago, it was common in K-12 classrooms for students to use construction paper to craft stereotypical renderings of Native American headdresses.
[01:57:36.833 --> 01:57:40.635]  There were stereotypical renderings of pilgrims as well.
[01:57:40.695 --> 01:57:41.635]  Give me a break.
[01:57:43.016 --> 01:57:46.738]  And of turkeys, you know, stereotypical turkey, you know, with your hand and so forth.
[01:57:46.798 --> 01:57:50.080]  Anyway, but they only stereotyped the poor Indians.
[01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:56.143]  And to pose as colonists and natives harmoniously sharing a meal together.
[01:57:56.303 --> 01:57:58.324]  Oh, we wouldn't want to have that lesson, would we?
[01:57:59.844 --> 01:58:03.326]  We wouldn't want to have people harmoniously sharing a meal together.
[01:58:03.486 --> 01:58:04.927]  No, no, not today.
[01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:20.293]  They said, now according to a citizen of the Kiowa tribe and the tribal educational specialist for the National Indian Education Association, he said there's a different perspective that needs to be considered, no, needs to be pushed according to Education Week.
[01:58:21.333 --> 01:58:30.196]  As Breitbart covers this story, they point out, they have another quote from Education Week, because you actually have to pay them money to read the rest of the article.
[01:58:32.244 --> 01:58:34.886]  That's their propaganda, but I guess somebody at Breitbart did, they said that.
[01:58:34.906 --> 01:58:50.337]  To help students appreciate colonial oppression of natives and the violence that ensued from it, this individual with the Kiowa tribe recommends that we reframe the holiday as an opportunity to honor representatives of native communities who greeted European visitors with open arms.
[01:58:50.917 --> 01:58:52.839]  They didn't perceive them as invaders.
[01:58:54.227 --> 01:58:55.508]  Oh yes, but they were invaders.
[01:58:56.208 --> 01:58:58.249]  At the time, because their numbers were so small.
[01:58:58.269 --> 01:58:59.730]  I was like, oh, wait a minute.
[01:59:01.090 --> 01:59:04.332]  He's not saying that we should be anti-immigrant, is he?
[01:59:04.432 --> 01:59:11.355]  I mean, you know, these pilgrims were, after all, according to this guy with the Native American tribes, they were illegal immigrants.
[01:59:11.435 --> 01:59:14.457]  And of course, they weren't a problem at the time because their numbers were so small.
[01:59:14.517 --> 01:59:16.198]  But you know, when you get the numbers to be large enough,
[01:59:16.991 --> 01:59:20.195]  You wind up having your civilization and your land taken over, don't you?
[01:59:20.375 --> 01:59:21.376]  Maybe that's the lesson.
[01:59:21.416 --> 01:59:24.620]  That's one I didn't teach my kids, but it's one that they ought to understand by now.
[01:59:25.741 --> 01:59:37.254]  You know, I've seen some of the curriculum that's being taught by some of the people pushing back against the traditional versions of Thanksgiving.
[01:59:37.972 --> 01:59:49.759]  I've actually seen them talk about how, you know, well, you know, these people get together for a wonderful meal, the Pilgrims and the Indians, they rounded them up, they said, well, we're all going to go into this building, and then they shot and burned all the Indians.
[01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:51.920]  Why?
[01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:53.021]  Is there any reason?
[01:59:53.061 --> 01:59:55.382]  Oh, no, you know, they're just evil white people doing that.
[01:59:55.822 --> 02:00:04.507]  Let me tell you, when somebody gives you something like that without any context, without any narration of motivation or anything, you know that you're just being fed a propaganda lie, don't you?
[02:00:05.348 --> 02:00:05.688]  Or do you?
[02:00:06.008 --> 02:00:06.749]  Do the kids know that?
[02:00:07.492 --> 02:00:08.092]  If they're told that?
[02:00:08.833 --> 02:00:09.513]  No, no.
[02:00:10.734 --> 02:00:15.657]  So it leaves out the context of relations between them and the early immigrants and how the settlers brought disease.
[02:00:16.998 --> 02:00:17.718]  We brought disease.
[02:00:17.918 --> 02:00:21.040]  See, it's a policy of genocide is what they're saying here.
[02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:24.062]  You know, we deliberately brought diseases to take them out.
[02:00:24.442 --> 02:00:31.386]  And so Education Week has got its project they call Citizen Z. You know, talking about a particular generation.
[02:00:32.116 --> 02:00:36.059]  Teaching civics in a divided nation.
[02:00:36.739 --> 02:00:37.780]  Let me tell you what they're really doing.
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:41.543]  They're teaching civics in a way in order to divide the nation.
[02:00:42.404 --> 02:00:43.464]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[02:00:43.645 --> 02:00:47.147]  They completely skip over anything that would unify us.
[02:00:47.788 --> 02:00:53.032]  Anything that would point to a benevolent God.
[02:00:53.732 --> 02:00:55.253]  That last aspect of that.
[02:00:55.373 --> 02:00:56.094]  You know, R.L.
[02:00:56.134 --> 02:00:58.756]  Dabney talked about what would happen with government schools.
[02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:10.573]  He knew that there was, and he was somebody who wrote right after the Civil War, he knew that it was what was going to happen as government began educating our kids with compulsory tax-funded schools.
[02:01:11.453 --> 02:01:20.195]  And so he asked the question in his tract, secularized education, he said, number one, who is the agent entitled to control education?
[02:01:20.376 --> 02:01:24.477]  And number two, what is the right kind of education?
[02:01:25.497 --> 02:01:29.278]  And he argued that neither the state nor the church
[02:01:30.123 --> 02:01:30.443]  I don't know.
[02:01:48.988 --> 02:01:52.671]  You understand when you look at this, you're going to force religion of the majority on the minority.
[02:01:52.731 --> 02:01:54.172]  That's one possibility.
[02:01:54.752 --> 02:01:57.674]  Or you could have different schools for each denomination, you know.
[02:01:57.694 --> 02:02:04.039]  The Jews get one and the Catholics get another and then each of the Protestant denominations, they get another one.
[02:02:04.059 --> 02:02:08.482]  Or you could have unsectarian religious instruction given just the beginning of the day.
[02:02:09.423 --> 02:02:10.223]  All of those things.
[02:02:11.155 --> 02:02:15.556]  Would be an issue for endorsing a religion.
[02:02:15.576 --> 02:02:20.058]  It would be oppressing people who dissent from that religion and so forth.
[02:02:20.818 --> 02:02:25.440]  And so that leaves us with just one result if the government is going to run the schools.
[02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:28.441]  That means you're going to secularize the state's teaching.
[02:02:29.301 --> 02:02:30.021]  Absolutely.
[02:02:31.162 --> 02:02:37.044]  And the state is going to set itself up as an opponent of God.
[02:02:37.104 --> 02:02:38.264]  It's not going to tolerate God.
[02:02:39.326 --> 02:02:46.450]  You know, we've had presidents in the past who have said, well, we need to set aside a day to thank God.
[02:02:46.730 --> 02:02:49.472]  You know, what does it mean when we say Thanksgiving?
[02:02:49.492 --> 02:02:51.253]  Who are you going to give thanks to?
[02:02:52.734 --> 02:03:03.601]  Well, these people, these secular humanists, these Democrats like Elizabeth Warren, just like Barack Obama, she's out there saying, you know, these billionaires, and she's defending her billionaire tax.
[02:03:04.731 --> 02:03:09.053]  She's saying, these people out there, they didn't really earn this.
[02:03:09.073 --> 02:03:12.455]  We're going to tell these billionaires, you think you built something in this country?
[02:03:13.116 --> 02:03:18.138]  Well, good for you, but you did it using workers that all of us paid to educate.
[02:03:18.178 --> 02:03:20.840]  You did it by getting all your goods on the roads and bridges, etc.
[02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:23.701]  I mean, she did the same thing that Barack Obama did, right?
[02:03:23.762 --> 02:03:25.502]  You didn't build this, government built it.
[02:03:26.283 --> 02:03:29.465]  So, you know, on a Democrat Thanksgiving Day, who are you going to thank?
[02:03:30.245 --> 02:03:30.525]  God?
[02:03:30.545 --> 02:03:30.585]  No.
[02:03:31.226 --> 02:03:34.007]  You're going to think government, because government is God.
[02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:36.969]  You look to God to provide everything for you, don't you?
[02:03:38.109 --> 02:03:42.351]  You look to God, or government, to keep you safe, to give you material wealth.
[02:03:43.992 --> 02:03:54.318]  The pilgrims and the people who started this country didn't see God as the provider of everything, the end-all and the be-all of everything.
[02:03:55.018 --> 02:03:56.199]  They knew who they needed to think.
[02:03:58.184 --> 02:03:58.605]  Stay with us.
[02:03:58.645 --> 02:04:01.286]  When we come back, I'm going to finish this up, and then we're going to go to Matt Bracken.
[02:04:01.866 --> 02:04:03.067]  He's going to be doing the fourth hour.
[02:04:03.547 --> 02:04:05.948]  I've got a couple more things I want to say about Thanksgiving.
[02:04:06.068 --> 02:04:06.468]  Stay with us.
[02:04:07.209 --> 02:04:07.649]  Welcome back.
[02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:12.891]  I had a couple more things to say about Thanksgiving, about the schools and what they've become.
[02:04:14.012 --> 02:04:14.792]  As I said, R.L.
[02:04:14.832 --> 02:04:18.974]  Dabney, as he looked at what was going to happen when we completely secularized education.
[02:04:18.994 --> 02:04:21.496]  He said if the government runs it, it's going to have to be secular education.
[02:04:21.536 --> 02:04:22.976]  He says, is that even possible?
[02:04:24.097 --> 02:04:26.238]  Is that possible to have secular education?
[02:04:27.008 --> 02:04:31.569]  He said, education is the nurture and the development of the whole man for the proper end.
[02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:33.870]  Its end is moral.
[02:04:34.610 --> 02:04:40.232]  He said, now you can educate somebody about how to use a hammer, how you can teach art, or you can teach skill.
[02:04:40.252 --> 02:04:42.393]  But he goes, that's not education.
[02:04:44.034 --> 02:04:52.056]  When the state says that they're going to educate you, what they're saying they're going to do is they're going to educate you with the goal of training you to be a citizen.
[02:04:52.096 --> 02:04:54.257]  They're talking about something that is inherently moral.
[02:04:55.503 --> 02:04:57.384]  And yet they're leaving morality out of it.
[02:04:57.484 --> 02:04:58.044]  Or are they?
[02:04:59.085 --> 02:05:01.066]  Or are they giving you their morality?
[02:05:01.086 --> 02:05:02.887]  You know, we have Focahannes, as I pointed out.
[02:05:02.907 --> 02:05:08.510]  She said, you know, all you billionaires and all you small businesses, you didn't build that.
[02:05:08.811 --> 02:05:09.391]  We built that.
[02:05:09.431 --> 02:05:10.312]  The government built that.
[02:05:11.152 --> 02:05:11.832]  It was made possible.
[02:05:11.932 --> 02:05:15.114]  Everything you have is because government made it possible.
[02:05:15.154 --> 02:05:16.035]  We educated you.
[02:05:16.515 --> 02:05:19.617]  We built the infrastructure, which is now decaying and so forth.
[02:05:20.317 --> 02:05:21.378]  But we did all that.
[02:05:22.728 --> 02:05:26.329]  And so, Focahontas and her Democrat tribe want you to worship them.
[02:05:27.249 --> 02:05:28.309]  They want you to worship the government.
[02:05:28.349 --> 02:05:49.373]  As a matter of fact, we've got schools now, as I pointed out last week, we've got schools in Colorado, where they've got them doing role-playing, teenagers doing role-playing of rape and anal sex, where they've got them reading poems by Allen Ginsberg, praising Moloch, the god of child sacrifice, in order to get economic reward.
[02:05:49.413 --> 02:05:50.973]  I mean, that's the tradition of Moloch.
[02:05:51.752 --> 02:05:52.352]  That's the religion.
[02:05:52.392 --> 02:05:53.913]  You're going to be taught something, right?
[02:05:53.933 --> 02:05:56.974]  It's just a question of which religion you're going to be taught.
[02:05:57.914 --> 02:06:01.796]  Now, the people who founded this country, they had suffered persecution.
[02:06:01.816 --> 02:06:03.596]  They came here for one reason, one reason only.
[02:06:04.397 --> 02:06:06.437]  They wanted to live freely.
[02:06:08.178 --> 02:06:10.619]  And they had fled Holland.
[02:06:10.639 --> 02:06:11.559]  They'd lived there for a while.
[02:06:11.619 --> 02:06:13.740]  They had seen the moral corruption in Holland.
[02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:16.161]  They wanted to separate themselves.
[02:06:17.472 --> 02:06:18.913]  And they wanted to be self-sufficient.
[02:06:18.973 --> 02:06:20.715]  And they were planning to go to Virginia.
[02:06:20.795 --> 02:06:22.677]  That was the plan.
[02:06:23.137 --> 02:06:27.181]  The storms kept them from, pushed them into Massachusetts.
[02:06:27.201 --> 02:06:28.783]  They tried to get out three different times.
[02:06:28.803 --> 02:06:31.145]  They kept getting pushed back into the same area.
[02:06:31.185 --> 02:06:33.687]  Finally, they said, well, I guess we're going to have to stay here.
[02:06:34.962 --> 02:06:41.384]  And because they had been headed to Virginia, they said, well, we don't have really any system of laws to set this up.
[02:06:41.404 --> 02:06:42.985]  So they created the Mayflower Compact.
[02:06:43.025 --> 02:06:53.188]  And that was the first time we had here in the United States a formal written law that was going to set up how society was going to be organized.
[02:06:54.409 --> 02:06:55.309]  They weren't anarchists.
[02:06:55.609 --> 02:06:58.470]  You know, they wanted to have some kind of a formal legal system.
[02:06:58.490 --> 02:07:03.732]  And so they referred back to the Magna Carta, the rule of law that was established by the Magna Carta.
[02:07:04.938 --> 02:07:07.899]  And they established majority rule.
[02:07:09.579 --> 02:07:10.700]  And then they made some mistakes.
[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:19.442]  As Bradford, he wrote a very detailed diary, pointed out, he said, well, they started essentially having a common area.
[02:07:19.522 --> 02:07:24.123]  Everybody would work and, you know, from each according to his ability to each according to his need, essentially.
[02:07:24.904 --> 02:07:30.831]  A system of communism, and we've seen this repeated over and over again for hundreds of years.
[02:07:31.171 --> 02:07:43.786]  Communism began back with the pilgrims, and they almost all starved to death, until he gave everybody private lots, private property, and said, grow what you're going to eat.
[02:07:46.676 --> 02:07:56.101]  Again, in the 1800s, the middle of the 1800s, we had a lot of communities that were set up along a communitarian basis, along a communist basis, trying to do the same things.
[02:07:56.262 --> 02:07:58.803]  Many of them thought it was the Christian thing to do.
[02:08:00.224 --> 02:08:03.686]  But no, God set up the idea of private property.
[02:08:03.726 --> 02:08:05.867]  What does it mean to say, thou shalt not steal?
[02:08:05.907 --> 02:08:08.229]  If you don't have private property, that doesn't have any meaning, right?
[02:08:09.509 --> 02:08:11.951]  But these people, as they landed in Massachusetts,
[02:08:13.406 --> 02:08:15.468]  They met the Indians that were there.
[02:08:15.848 --> 02:08:16.548]  They met Squanto.
[02:08:16.568 --> 02:08:17.549]  That's an amazing story.
[02:08:17.769 --> 02:08:22.433]  If you've never read that story, Focus on the Family has a great story about that.
[02:08:22.473 --> 02:08:24.174]  But they saw God's providence there.
[02:08:25.575 --> 02:08:30.919]  And they saw it as an opportunity to share the wealth that they had been given.
[02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:34.762]  What they knew about a personal God with the people there.
[02:08:34.782 --> 02:08:37.083]  They weren't coming to enslave people, to kill people.
[02:08:37.824 --> 02:08:41.947]  They were coming to live freely and to share the greatest treasure they had.
[02:08:43.285 --> 02:08:43.645]  That's it.
[02:08:43.885 --> 02:08:44.406]  We'll be right back.
[02:09:00.016 --> 02:09:04.199]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:09.623]  The most powerful and influential Jewish organization in the world.
[02:09:10.163 --> 02:09:12.645]  The ADL, or Anti-Defamation League.
[02:09:13.644 --> 02:09:14.945]  And maybe fines are not enough.
[02:09:14.965 --> 02:09:15.845]  Maybe it's time
[02:09:39.502 --> 02:09:42.684]  The ADL then goes further and calls for a purge of everyone who does not
[02:10:01.778 --> 02:10:02.838]  Agree with them.
[02:10:03.179 --> 02:10:08.981]  Insist on facts and purge these lies and conspiracies from their platforms.
[02:10:09.341 --> 02:10:15.263]  Ladies and gentlemen, not even Hitler gave speeches this evil and this draconian.
[02:10:15.703 --> 02:10:17.944]  He just took over and then carried out the evil.
[02:10:19.885 --> 02:10:30.049]  Multinational corporations, working with groups like the ADL, have decided to brand any resistance to their takeover as anti-Semitic.
[02:10:31.052 --> 02:10:36.836]  This is so incredibly dangerous and it's going to blow up in the face of those that are trying it.
[02:10:37.817 --> 02:10:45.863]  It's the ADL spokesperson that famously said, throw the Jew down the well so my country can be free.
[02:10:48.605 --> 02:11:00.775]  Well, I simply say uphold the Bill of Rights and Constitution and stand up to those that want to gag the people of the United States just as the people of Europe and the UK have been silenced.
[02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:04.132]  This is the tyranny in our age.
[02:11:04.973 --> 02:11:06.114]  This is the threat.
[02:11:07.135 --> 02:11:09.777]  This is the authoritarianism.
[02:11:10.077 --> 02:11:12.179]  Do it again and you go to jail.
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:28.113]  Since when in history have we heard a powerful organization via their celebrity spokesperson say, if corporations don't do our exact bidding, we are going to have their directors arrested.
[02:11:30.583 --> 02:11:34.705]  If what you just heard isn't Hitlerian, nothing is.
[02:11:35.405 --> 02:11:42.428]  It's why YouTube recommended videos by the conspiracist Alex Jones billions of times.
[02:11:43.169 --> 02:11:49.972]  It's why fake news outperforms real news, because studies show that lies spread faster than truth.
[02:11:50.692 --> 02:11:57.576]  And it's no surprise that the greatest propaganda machine in history has spread the oldest conspiracy theory in history.
[02:11:58.116 --> 02:12:00.857]  The lie that Jews are somehow dangerous.
[02:12:01.257 --> 02:12:03.839]  So the trick is very, very elementary.
[02:12:04.259 --> 02:12:09.662]  Convince everyone that there's a second Holocaust about to happen and that there are Nazis under every table.
[02:12:10.424 --> 02:12:17.309]  And then switch it to Alex Jones and Donald Trump and Nationalists and Conservatives.
[02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:22.473]  On the internet, everything can appear equally legitimate.
[02:12:23.054 --> 02:12:24.975]  Breitbart resembles the BBC.
[02:12:25.476 --> 02:12:30.800]  The fictitious protocols of the Elders of Zion look as valid as an ADL report.
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:34.162]  So the ADL is going to protect us from all these Nazis.
[02:12:34.242 --> 02:12:44.628]  And then we learn they're Alex Jones, Donald Trump, Breitbart, Stephen Miller, anybody that doesn't like George Soros, that was an actual Nazi collaborator and said it was the best time of his life on 60 Minutes.
[02:12:45.548 --> 02:12:46.309]  This is dangerous.
[02:12:47.329 --> 02:12:49.231]  But it's more than just a power grab.
[02:12:49.251 --> 02:12:58.336]  It's also about money, because the ADL is already paid hundreds of millions of dollars a year by big tech to run their moderation and the training of their censors.
[02:13:00.143 --> 02:13:08.167]  Cohen says that's not enough, you better spend unlimited amounts of money to stop what they deem as thought crime.
[02:13:08.627 --> 02:13:16.151]  Now in their defense, these social media companies have taken some steps to reduce hate and conspiracies on their platforms.
[02:13:16.571 --> 02:13:18.772]  But these steps have been mainly superficial.
[02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:30.182]  The ADL teleprompter reader insults all of his viewers by claiming that big text censorship directed and captained by the ADL has only been superficial.
[02:13:31.262 --> 02:13:33.422]  Hundreds of millions of accounts have been suspended.
[02:13:33.762 --> 02:13:37.263]  Anyone promoting Trump or nationalism in the Second Amendment has been banned.
[02:13:37.803 --> 02:13:42.844]  Thousands of people I know have lost their bank accounts at the ADL's direction.
[02:13:43.684 --> 02:13:46.345]  What did Hitler do in Nazi Germany in the early years?
[02:13:46.385 --> 02:13:48.185]  He took Jews' bank accounts away.
[02:13:48.584 --> 02:13:50.745]  And wouldn't let them engage in commerce.
[02:13:51.406 --> 02:14:00.111]  Voltaire was right when he said, those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.
[02:14:01.371 --> 02:14:03.313]  Arrest people that don't submit.
[02:14:03.613 --> 02:14:04.533]  Purge the internet.
[02:14:05.374 --> 02:14:08.636]  This is what you hear out of megalomaniac's mouths.
[02:14:09.616 --> 02:14:13.799]  And the stench of authoritarian danger is absolutely overwhelming.
[02:14:14.439 --> 02:14:17.441]  This can't possibly be what the creators of the internet had in mind.
[02:14:18.126 --> 02:14:24.392]  One of the few true things that Cohen said was that the Internet wasn't supposed to be like this.
[02:14:24.452 --> 02:14:25.893]  It wasn't supposed to defeat the globalists.
[02:14:25.933 --> 02:14:27.715]  It wasn't supposed to empower humanity.
[02:14:27.975 --> 02:14:33.900]  It was supposed to control and surveil and track everyone and bind everyone into this authoritarian system.
[02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:37.924]  But instead it has been used to expose corruption to a great extent.
[02:14:38.344 --> 02:14:40.426]  And so now they're playing a game of catch-up.
[02:14:41.175 --> 02:14:44.416]  In an attempt to tap down on the resistance worldwide.
[02:14:44.996 --> 02:14:48.098]  And the power structure is in a full bore panic.
[02:14:48.518 --> 02:14:52.239]  And their attempt to crush dissent is only going to increase it.
[02:14:52.939 --> 02:15:08.665]  But Infowars is a main target of these organizations because we want to bring everyone together like Martin Luther King did and promote a true Western Renaissance culture of freedom based around the principles that our Republic was founded with.
[02:15:09.266 --> 02:15:09.886]  And that's why
[02:15:10.509 --> 02:15:12.410]  The forces of evil want to shut us down.
[02:15:12.731 --> 02:15:21.616]  That's why it's more important than ever that any viewer or listener understand this is a quest to be able to get information out of the people so they can make decisions for themselves.
[02:15:22.257 --> 02:15:28.981]  You'll find our censored videos, articles, and more at Banned.Video and Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:15:29.562 --> 02:15:35.806]  Without you spreading those articles and those videos, we are not going to be able to reach new people during this incredible time.
[02:15:36.627 --> 02:15:38.808]  And the forces of authoritarian globalism are going to win.
[02:15:39.462 --> 02:15:39.862]  Who is Alex Jones?
[02:15:39.882 --> 02:15:44.443]  Mainstream media calls him a conspiracy theorist, fake news, crazy, and worst of all, a fear monger.
[02:15:44.683 --> 02:15:45.803]  But the only thing to truly fear

[02:16:57.171 --> 02:17:00.133]  Okay, you've got Matt Bracken for the rest of the hour.
[02:17:01.072 --> 02:17:05.774]  That was a terrific video that Alex was previewing there at the top of the hour.
[02:17:05.794 --> 02:17:12.797]  Because this is an information war, and you guys that are tuned in today, you're on the front line.
[02:17:13.477 --> 02:17:17.799]  And this is not just happening in America, it's happening all around the world.
[02:17:18.439 --> 02:17:28.984]  And it's not just the globalists that are trying to stifle free speech under the guise of banning hate speech, which means opinions that they don't agree with.
[02:17:29.775 --> 02:17:35.751]  There's a synergy or a synthesis going on with Islamization.
[02:17:36.488 --> 02:17:40.710]  Which is seeing the end of free speech beginning primarily in Europe.
[02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:42.391]  Of course, it's already gone in the Middle East.
[02:17:42.932 --> 02:17:51.276]  But in Europe, free speech is being banned under the guise of stopping the incitement of hatred.
[02:17:51.617 --> 02:18:02.743]  So even if you say things that are truthful about Muhammad or the Quran, you can be hauled in front of a court and fined or even jailed for telling the truth.
[02:18:03.223 --> 02:18:05.365]  Because Muslims don't like it.
[02:18:05.805 --> 02:18:08.508]  There's a concept called Islamic slander.
[02:18:09.048 --> 02:18:13.412]  And when we come back, I'm going to have a special guest for the rest of the hour.
[02:18:13.912 --> 02:18:23.500]  We're going to discuss how this is happening in Europe and what it means to the rest of the country or the rest of the world and really coming to America in the future.
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:24.841]  It's going to be the next thing.
[02:18:25.402 --> 02:18:29.185]  Banning free speech under the guise of banning hate speech
[02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:31.471]  And not offending Muslims.
[02:18:31.951 --> 02:18:37.272]  Those are the twin tracks of the end of freedom of speech in America and around the world.
[02:18:37.853 --> 02:18:44.655]  My guest for the rest of the hour, some people have compared her to a female Forrest Gump.
[02:18:45.595 --> 02:18:58.099]  She was the daughter of an Austrian diplomat, or is the daughter of an Austrian diplomat, but she grew up learning English in America, so she spent some of her middle school years in the States, so she speaks perfect English.
[02:18:59.042 --> 02:19:14.391]  But she also lived in, and get this, Iran before and during the revolution, Iraq, Kuwait, when Saddam Hussein's army invaded and in fact she was one of the hostages and got out in one of those convoys.
[02:19:15.371 --> 02:19:23.776]  She was in Libya during 9-11 and she's been back in Austria during the 2000s.
[02:19:24.196 --> 02:19:27.578]  Well, growing up as a female in the Middle East, living
[02:19:28.351 --> 02:19:29.932]  You know, side by side with Sharia.
[02:19:29.952 --> 02:19:33.093]  Of course, she had diplomatic, some diplomatic protection.
[02:19:33.813 --> 02:19:40.276]  But as a diplomatic kid, you know, you still go to all kinds of different schools and you're exposed to the local culture.
[02:19:41.056 --> 02:19:46.078]  And she didn't like what she saw in terms of being a woman in a Sharia country.
[02:19:46.739 --> 02:19:54.242]  When she came back to Austria, she was horrified to see that her country was already bending towards Sharia.
[02:19:54.961 --> 02:20:07.874]  And she began in the mid-2000s giving private seminars to people on the dangers of what she saw as creeping Islamization in her country and in Europe.
[02:20:08.655 --> 02:20:16.442]  At one of these private seminars, these weren't public on the street, this is like a house party seminar, somebody
[02:20:18.063 --> 02:20:38.932]  She claimed or wrote down that she had said something about Mohammed, namely that he was a pedophile because Mohammed had slept with his favorite wife of his many wives, Aisha, whom he had married when he was in his 50s and she was 6, and then quote-unquote consummated the marriage at 9.
[02:20:39.952 --> 02:20:44.374]  She was brought up on hate speech laws in Austria,
[02:20:45.279 --> 02:20:49.721]  You spent years in and out of court over this and was convicted.
[02:20:49.861 --> 02:21:00.544]  And the conviction was based on the fact that Muhammad didn't only sleep with Aisha when she was nine, but continued to sleep with her until she was a teenager.
[02:21:00.884 --> 02:21:03.085]  Therefore, he couldn't be a pedophile.
[02:21:03.565 --> 02:21:05.526]  I mean, you can hardly make this stuff up.
[02:21:06.026 --> 02:21:08.847]  The point is, there is no free speech in Islam.
[02:21:09.507 --> 02:21:11.328]  And in Austria and in Europe,
[02:21:12.488 --> 02:21:17.270]  The concept of free speech that we have in America, it doesn't exist at all.
[02:21:17.930 --> 02:21:28.494]  And the European bureaucrats and politicians are more afraid already of their Muslim minorities than they are concerned about preserving freedom.
[02:21:28.955 --> 02:21:37.218]  So they're more worried about inciting the anger of the Muslims than they are of their own people losing their freedom.
[02:21:37.822 --> 02:21:43.887]  So, without further ado, I'd like to bring on a woman named Elizabeth Sabanich-Wolf.
[02:21:44.387 --> 02:21:57.117]  She has shared the dais with people like Diana West, Robert Spencer, Claire Lopez, Stephen Coughlin, Alan West, all of these counter-jihad heavy hitters.
[02:21:57.517 --> 02:22:00.199]  Well, she is one of the counter-jihad heavy hitters herself.
[02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:02.121]  So, Elizabeth, welcome aboard.
[02:22:03.411 --> 02:22:05.592]  Well, thank you so much, Matt.
[02:22:05.632 --> 02:22:06.873]  It's an honor to be with you.
[02:22:07.253 --> 02:22:13.416]  And you've named some of my very favorite people and they are personal heroes of mine.
[02:22:13.436 --> 02:22:20.320]  I haven't met them, but I've read I've read a lot of their books and I do check their websites.
[02:22:20.900 --> 02:22:22.441]  Gates of Vienna, Vlad Tepes
[02:22:23.664 --> 02:22:28.605]  Pam Geller's website, Robert Spencer's Jihad Watch, all of them, they're very important.
[02:22:28.985 --> 02:22:36.807]  And it's notable that some of these people, like Pam Geller and Robert Spencer, they're not even allowed to travel, for example, to Britain anymore.
[02:22:37.147 --> 02:22:44.868]  You can be a returning ISIS terrorist, you're welcome, with open arms, but the counter-jihad heroes are not even allowed in Europe.
[02:22:46.188 --> 02:22:47.189]  How true, how true.
[02:22:47.229 --> 02:22:48.549]  And it's really a sad
[02:22:49.969 --> 02:22:51.049]  situation.
[02:22:51.569 --> 02:22:52.550]  It's very depressing.
[02:22:53.250 --> 02:22:54.470]  And it's frightening.
[02:22:54.690 --> 02:22:59.431]  And honestly, I don't even know if I'm allowed into the United Kingdom.
[02:22:59.511 --> 02:23:00.271]  I haven't tried.
[02:23:00.791 --> 02:23:02.912]  And I'm not really sure if I want to.
[02:23:03.892 --> 02:23:10.473]  But one of these days, I'll probably give it a try just to, yeah, just to give it a try and see what happens.
[02:23:11.533 --> 02:23:15.214]  Well, I have I have your book on Kindle, so I can't hold it up.
[02:23:15.754 --> 02:23:18.455]  But you have a book about your experience.
[02:23:18.495 --> 02:23:18.935]  There you go.
[02:23:19.912 --> 02:23:24.138]  You have a book about your experiences and it's called The Truth is No Defense.
[02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:26.282]  It was just published, wasn't it?
[02:23:27.931 --> 02:23:44.384]  It was published a week and a half ago and it looks quite good in terms of sales, but of course, you know, I want as many people as possible to read about what can happen to you in just, you know, a few days.
[02:23:45.184 --> 02:23:57.254]  And if you're not careful what you say, and this means you have to self-censor here in Europe, which I do every single day and I tell my daughter to self-censor when she's in school,
[02:23:58.594 --> 02:24:10.118]  But also in the United States, you have something called prior restraint, which is certainly not compatible with the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
[02:24:12.079 --> 02:24:22.622]  You know, if we kind of dodged the bullet in the fact that Hillary Clinton was not elected president, because she was, as Secretary of State,
[02:24:23.323 --> 02:24:31.970]  I think it's number 822, but she was supporting a UN resolution which was proposed by people have never heard of, you know, the second biggest
[02:24:33.083 --> 02:24:40.766]  A group of nations on the planet is something called the OIC, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.
[02:24:40.786 --> 02:24:42.007]  57 nations.
[02:24:42.547 --> 02:24:45.788]  Remember Obama said, I've been to almost all 57 states?
[02:24:46.209 --> 02:24:47.569]  I think it was a Freudian slip.
[02:24:48.069 --> 02:24:51.231]  Because the OIC is the 57 Muslim nations.
[02:24:51.751 --> 02:24:57.873]  And they're like the 500-pound gorilla in the zoo because they have so much clout.
[02:24:57.933 --> 02:25:02.055]  Because those 57 countries are like a mailed fist.
[02:25:02.651 --> 02:25:26.989]  You know, going into a bowl of Jell-O, and they've been promoting this concept of anti-blasphemy laws, which would be formalizing what happened to you in Austria, that you do not have the freedom of speech, because in the Islamic concept of blasphemy and slander, the truth is no defense, as your book said.
[02:25:27.470 --> 02:25:30.352]  It's whatever angers Muslims, that's what's slander.
[02:25:31.519 --> 02:25:40.825]  It's that which a Muslim will or might dislike, no matter the content or whether or not it's truth.
[02:25:41.045 --> 02:25:46.789]  So my book called The Truth is No Defense is exactly what happened to me.
[02:25:46.869 --> 02:25:58.377]  It's the story of how European or Western nations start using Sharia laws without even knowing that they are using them.
[02:25:58.417 --> 02:26:01.099]  They will never, of course, never say or agree
[02:26:02.099 --> 02:26:11.102]  Or admit that this is the Islamic concept of slander that they applied to my court, you know, in my court case.
[02:26:11.962 --> 02:26:13.343]  But this is exactly what happened.
[02:26:13.603 --> 02:26:17.604]  And just to remind you, you were looking for the UN resolution.
[02:26:17.984 --> 02:26:20.004]  It was called Resolution 1618.
[02:26:21.505 --> 02:26:28.407]  And if that had been implemented, the First Amendment would have been torn to shreds, basically.
[02:26:29.656 --> 02:26:40.058]  Right, and the Muslims will say, well, we're not only trying to protect Islam, we'll also make it illegal to do things like make art with the Bible.
[02:26:40.578 --> 02:26:43.998]  But nobody in the Christian country has been asking for this.
[02:26:44.599 --> 02:26:54.340]  This is strictly a way for Islam to avoid any criticism of primarily the, I can say it here in America, pedophile prophet.
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:58.341]  When we come back after the break, we're going to continue this discussion.
[02:26:59.139 --> 02:26:59.799]  Stand by.
[02:26:59.819 --> 02:27:07.584]  Yeah, I'm back with Elizabeth Sabetich-Wolf, who is one of my counter-jihad heroines.
[02:27:08.244 --> 02:27:14.528]  She is literally on the front line of the counter-jihad, living in occupied Austria.
[02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:22.933]  I noted that recently there's even a statue of Jan Sobieski that was going to be gifted and
[02:27:25.544 --> 02:27:27.505]  Austria wouldn't take it.
[02:27:28.025 --> 02:27:33.127]  The Sharia-Demi status seems to be well underway.
[02:27:33.908 --> 02:27:45.773]  And if this UN resolution ever passes, 1816, which makes blasphemy laws global and universal, don't be surprised if this passes.
[02:27:46.233 --> 02:27:53.676]  Because the tech giants that Alex was talking about in the video near the top of the hour, they'd be happy to support this.
[02:27:54.457 --> 02:28:08.909]  You know, the totalitarians of the left and the totalitarians of Islam, some people call it the red-green alliance, they're both happy to cooperate when it comes to crushing free speech.
[02:28:09.510 --> 02:28:15.335]  Because free speech in most of the world is the only pillar of freedom that they really have.
[02:28:16.149 --> 02:28:24.176]  At least in the United States, uniquely probably in the world, we not only have the First Amendment, we have the Second Amendment.
[02:28:24.616 --> 02:28:32.843]  So if they tried to actually take away the First Amendment, they might come up against the Second Amendment in a very hard way.
[02:28:33.464 --> 02:28:35.866]  But that solution is not available in Europe.
[02:28:36.787 --> 02:28:40.690]  In Europe, you see videos coming out of Holland, for example,
[02:28:41.451 --> 02:28:49.316]  Of Native kids just being beaten by gangs of refugees, immigrants, what do you want to call them?
[02:28:50.157 --> 02:28:51.317]  And there's no recourse.
[02:28:51.437 --> 02:29:08.788]  All the Native Europeans can do is stare out of a window, maybe make a recording on their smartphone, and if they post it to the internet, the police will come around and accuse them of inciting violence or inciting hatred for posting a video of a crime that they saw.
[02:29:10.365 --> 02:29:21.517]  Elizabeth Sabanich-Wolf, she's not just a witness, she's actually, you know, a participant in this entire process of Islamization.
[02:29:22.078 --> 02:29:32.349]  So, Elizabeth, I'm sorry, go ahead and let's talk about where your case is now and what's happening going forward with your case in Austria.
[02:29:34.213 --> 02:29:35.914]  Well, the case is over.
[02:29:36.234 --> 02:29:38.095]  The case is now completely over.
[02:29:38.155 --> 02:29:39.996]  There's no legal recourse for me.
[02:29:40.677 --> 02:29:50.082]  Once the European Court of Human Rights decides and refuses the final appeal, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
[02:29:50.202 --> 02:29:52.283]  It's now over and done with.
[02:29:53.024 --> 02:29:58.186]  And we have to, all of us in Europe, have to accept that
[02:29:59.676 --> 02:30:07.057]  The law system, the justice system has succumbed to Sharia, to Sharia law, which is very sad.
[02:30:08.518 --> 02:30:11.078]  But there's nothing I can do anymore.
[02:30:11.318 --> 02:30:12.539]  It's over and done with.
[02:30:13.139 --> 02:30:28.502]  What I can do and what I've set my sights on is to come to America as often as I can, as often as my family permits me to do so, and to warn Americans about
[02:30:30.933 --> 02:30:32.313]  They're about to lose.
[02:30:32.433 --> 02:30:34.574]  Americans are about to lose their First Amendment.
[02:30:35.594 --> 02:30:44.257]  And this must not happen because the First Amendment is the gold standard of freedom of speech or freedom in general on this planet.
[02:30:44.977 --> 02:30:50.579]  So it is my duty, I believe, to warn Americans
[02:30:51.159 --> 02:31:08.743]  To rally Americans, to let them know that we in Europe are looking to our American brothers and sisters and we're hoping that one day America will restore freedom of speech in the Western Judeo-Christian world.
[02:31:10.563 --> 02:31:17.465]  When you go on the internet, are you able to access websites like Jihad Watch and Gates of Vienna?
[02:31:18.769 --> 02:31:19.489]  Yes, I can.
[02:31:19.629 --> 02:31:21.050]  I have no problems at all.
[02:31:22.050 --> 02:31:25.831]  Do you think that you're monitored or do you think you're on some kind of a watch list now?
[02:31:26.431 --> 02:31:28.032]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[02:31:28.052 --> 02:31:29.432]  I've always been on a watch list.
[02:31:31.132 --> 02:31:33.593]  So you have to watch what you would post on social media?
[02:31:35.094 --> 02:31:37.034]  I don't use social media at all.
[02:31:38.034 --> 02:31:45.236]  Okay, because even like sharing a cartoon or a meme or, you know, an article, that's too risky?
[02:31:46.177 --> 02:31:47.337]  No, no, won't do that.
[02:31:48.504 --> 02:31:53.689]  Because even if you're sharing it, then I guess it's seen legally that you are promulgating an idea.
[02:31:53.709 --> 02:31:53.769]  Yes.
[02:31:54.490 --> 02:31:56.351]  Been there, done that.
[02:31:57.112 --> 02:31:57.272]  No.
[02:31:58.854 --> 02:31:59.094]  Wow.
[02:31:59.354 --> 02:32:00.275]  But this is a shame.
[02:32:00.695 --> 02:32:05.540]  Because, you know, it was I think 14 years ago that the cartoon controversy erupted.
[02:32:07.221 --> 02:32:13.207]  And we saw that it was followed by what was called the days of rage in the Islamic world.
[02:32:13.939 --> 02:32:23.225]  Which, where these cartoons were added to with other cartoons that were not part of the newspaper publishing of a few Muhammad cartoons.
[02:32:24.085 --> 02:32:31.390]  And this led to people being killed, burned, riots, arson attacks where people were murdered.
[02:32:32.210 --> 02:32:46.598]  And I understand now that in Norway, there has been, about two weeks ago, a Koran burning, which the police tried to prevent, even though there is no longer a blasphemy law in Norway.
[02:32:47.379 --> 02:32:52.762]  The police tried to prevent it, also citing incitement to violence and things like that.
[02:32:53.242 --> 02:32:58.145]  So essentially, anything that makes Muslims angry enough to go berserk and turn violent,
[02:32:59.295 --> 02:33:09.159]  It's now considered that the people of, you know, for example, exercising their right to buy a book and do what they like with it, it's no longer permitted.
[02:33:09.819 --> 02:33:13.121]  And, you know, nobody wants to see violence.
[02:33:13.221 --> 02:33:17.963]  But I think it's an important lesson in the West that once you surrender your rights,
[02:33:19.017 --> 02:33:34.210]  It's just a question of the next, it's, you know, only halal meat slaughter and hijabs and then burqas in, you know, on passports and driver licenses and in public places.
[02:33:34.911 --> 02:33:37.153]  And step by step, Sharia is coming.
[02:33:37.533 --> 02:33:43.138]  I mean, in most European countries, the most popular and most common boy's name is now Mohammed.
[02:33:43.698 --> 02:33:45.459]  So, looking forward 15 or 20 years,
[02:33:47.816 --> 02:33:52.658]  I think most of these countries are going to have a hard time ever resisting Sharia.
[02:33:53.539 --> 02:33:56.320]  I mean, that's... Well, we're not doing it now.
[02:33:56.520 --> 02:34:08.666]  It's not... Since we're not resisting Sharia right now, how are we going to resist it in 20 years when our population will have been decimated dramatically?
[02:34:09.346 --> 02:34:12.207]  Just to give you an example, I mean, I have one daughter.
[02:34:13.228 --> 02:34:15.309]  My next-door neighbors are refugees from Iraq.
[02:34:17.428 --> 02:34:20.497]  Four daughters and a fifth a boy on his way.
[02:34:20.517 --> 02:34:20.838]  Now this is
[02:34:24.761 --> 02:34:28.124]  I mean, what else should we discuss?
[02:34:28.244 --> 02:34:32.727]  I mean, it's basically over, given that the demographics are changing so rapidly.
[02:34:33.468 --> 02:34:46.277]  And, you know, as long as we have fewer European babies, native European babies, and more non-European babies, no matter what we do, we're going to lose.
[02:34:46.838 --> 02:34:49.600]  Be it in 20 years, be it in 30 years, it doesn't really matter.
[02:34:50.260 --> 02:34:55.164]  It's probably going to be in my lifetime and certainly in my daughter's lifetime.
[02:34:55.745 --> 02:35:07.114]  And that is very frightening, especially because we could have stopped this a few years ago, but now we've reached the point of no return.
[02:35:08.315 --> 02:35:09.776]  So we can't stop it anymore.
[02:35:10.236 --> 02:35:16.782]  And if we do stop it, it's, I'm afraid, going to be very violent, which is something that I do not want.
[02:35:17.628 --> 02:35:21.109]  But what I've been fearful of all along.
[02:35:22.870 --> 02:35:30.692]  When we come back, I want to talk about a concept called hybrid vigor, which I'll leave that as a mystery for now.
[02:35:30.812 --> 02:35:35.094]  But Americans who look at Europe and say, that's their problem.
[02:35:35.394 --> 02:35:36.054]  Who cares?
[02:35:36.554 --> 02:35:37.514]  So they were chicken.
[02:35:37.574 --> 02:35:38.455]  They surrendered.
[02:35:38.515 --> 02:35:39.455]  They didn't resist.
[02:35:39.495 --> 02:35:41.356]  They didn't have a first and second amendment.
[02:35:41.736 --> 02:35:42.656]  They didn't fight back.
[02:35:43.251 --> 02:35:48.352]  Americans who look at Europe and say, it's not my problem, it doesn't concern me.
[02:35:48.912 --> 02:35:52.633]  You have to look at Europe as the giant canary in the coal mine.
[02:35:52.653 --> 02:35:56.974]  You know, Europe is just a decade or so ahead of America.
[02:35:57.034 --> 02:35:58.155]  That's the only difference.
[02:35:58.775 --> 02:36:07.377]  And when we come back, I'm going to talk about why an Islamicized Europe would be so dangerous to the rest of the world.
[02:36:07.975 --> 02:36:14.719]  It wouldn't just be like Islam that we understand in places like Morocco or Egypt.
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:16.941]  It would be an entirely new beast.
[02:36:17.461 --> 02:36:23.885]  And when we come back after the break, I want to discuss this concept of hybrid vigor and what it means to the entire world.
[02:36:25.766 --> 02:36:36.313]  My last novel that I finished about two years ago, it takes place between Ireland and Morocco, and it's a rescue novel.
[02:36:37.864 --> 02:36:42.845]  But the twist at the end is that everything that I describe in the novel actually happened in history.
[02:36:43.746 --> 02:36:51.188]  Every single event, all of the characters, they actually happened during the Barbary era, you know, in the 16 and 1700s.
[02:36:51.988 --> 02:36:57.189]  When Islam is weak, which it was most of this century, we tend to disregard it.
[02:36:57.549 --> 02:37:01.850]  But when Europe is weak and Islam is strong, they break out.
[02:37:02.671 --> 02:37:04.291]  And the difference this time is,
[02:37:04.818 --> 02:37:14.061]  It's not just pirates raiding on the high seas or making raids like into Ireland or France or Italy or even Iceland, which they did.
[02:37:14.701 --> 02:37:34.106]  Now, there's a much worse dynamic because traders within the gates of Europe, who actually really hate Western civilization, they're allowing this invasion to happen because they think it will help to break the back of Western Judeo-Christian civilization.
[02:37:34.847 --> 02:37:42.249]  They don't realize, these socialists don't realize, in the end, like many others, they'll wind up Islamicized themselves.
[02:37:42.749 --> 02:37:57.673]  You know, for 1,400 years, Islam has defeated adjoining countries that were richer, stronger, smarter, and basically mocked these, you know, cruel desert savages.
[02:37:58.094 --> 02:38:00.354]  But you come back a century later, and guess what?
[02:38:00.914 --> 02:38:02.315]  The cruel desert savages won.
[02:38:03.490 --> 02:38:08.178]  You know, when the Mongols invaded the Crimea, they defeated militarily.
[02:38:08.218 --> 02:38:11.444]  They defeated the Arabs, the Muslims that were there.
[02:38:12.005 --> 02:38:15.591]  You come back a century later, the Mongols are Islamic.
[02:38:16.169 --> 02:38:21.372]  So it's a very devious strategy appealing to the worst urges of men.
[02:38:21.813 --> 02:38:23.153]  Women have nothing to do with it.
[02:38:23.674 --> 02:38:27.616]  Sort of promising men, like a deal with the devil.
[02:38:27.676 --> 02:38:30.718]  You can have multiple wives, you can beat them, divorce them.
[02:38:31.459 --> 02:38:34.781]  You can rape women who aren't Muslims freely.
[02:38:35.601 --> 02:38:40.164]  It's a horrible, to me, very satanic and diabolic cult.
[02:38:40.784 --> 02:38:43.066]  And it has spread successfully for 1,400 years.
[02:38:45.262 --> 02:39:00.936]  And something, when I was researching this book, my counter-jihad novel, I didn't realize that when the invasion of Spain happened, it wasn't the Spanish, or excuse me, it wasn't the like desert Arabs that invaded Spain.
[02:39:01.777 --> 02:39:08.002]  It was the very strong, powerful Berbers of Morocco who had recently been Islamicized.
[02:39:08.563 --> 02:39:12.246]  So this scrawny desert Arabs that invaded across North Africa
[02:39:13.078 --> 02:39:16.961]  Conquered Morocco, one valley, one mountain, one tribe at a time.
[02:39:17.462 --> 02:39:27.510]  And when they had the entire country, this very strong, powerful, newly rejuvenated with that Berber blood, that's who invaded Spain.
[02:39:28.191 --> 02:39:32.755]  When the Turks would raid into the Balkans,
[02:39:33.223 --> 02:39:35.326]  They actually kidnapped children.
[02:39:35.346 --> 02:39:42.534]  It was like part of their tax to take the strongest young men and the prettiest young girls back to Turkey.
[02:39:42.995 --> 02:39:51.705]  They actually called them the Janissary Corps, and they were very smart, strong, and their best soldiers.
[02:39:52.876 --> 02:40:00.282]  If Islam succeeds in completely putting Europe under Sharia, they're not going to be scrawny desert Arabs.
[02:40:00.643 --> 02:40:06.467]  They're going to be big, strong Swedes and Germans, but fully fanatically Islamic.
[02:40:06.928 --> 02:40:16.416]  So don't think that it's going to be, you know, something we don't have to worry about, because the new Islamicized Europe, they're going to have the rocket scientists and the
[02:40:18.297 --> 02:40:23.942]  You know, the ordnance engineers, they're not going to be weak, pitiful, puny, little scrawny things.
[02:40:24.302 --> 02:40:29.427]  They're going to be powerful and strong and have the fanaticism of the convert.
[02:40:29.907 --> 02:40:43.739]  So that's my worry is not only, you know, that Europeans are going to lose their freedom, but in Islamic Europe is going to be a very dangerous powerhouse in terms of its fanaticism and its new population.
[02:40:44.820 --> 02:40:46.361]  They're going to be something to behold.
[02:40:47.222 --> 02:40:51.643]  And I hate to sound depressing, but at least I'm not living there like Elizabeth.
[02:40:52.523 --> 02:40:59.165]  So, I don't know what the future holds for your children, but it's very worrisome to me.
[02:41:01.586 --> 02:41:02.826]  Yes, Matt.
[02:41:02.986 --> 02:41:04.807]  It worries me every single day.
[02:41:07.250 --> 02:41:10.172]  Don't think that I will leave my country.
[02:41:10.593 --> 02:41:15.897]  I've been asked many, many times, well, why don't you emigrate to the United States?
[02:41:16.618 --> 02:41:20.341]  You know, you could do so much good over here and we'd love to have you.
[02:41:21.082 --> 02:41:30.129]  And, you know, it is, you know, it's worth thinking about, especially given that I do know the language and I do know the Constitution.
[02:41:30.189 --> 02:41:33.892]  So I guess the citizenship test wouldn't be too much of a challenge for me.
[02:41:34.793 --> 02:41:35.354]  But honestly,
[02:41:36.432 --> 02:41:45.575]  I love my country and I will not leave my country to these people wanting to take over the country and wanting it for themselves.
[02:41:46.376 --> 02:41:58.120]  And given that my husband is in the Austrian army, there's absolutely no possibility for us to leave Austria.
[02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:03.922]  And you know, Katie Hopkins did a very good documentary about the white
[02:42:05.677 --> 02:42:07.879]  I know in Germany there's the AFD party.
[02:42:08.019 --> 02:42:09.640]  Is there anything like that in Austria?
[02:42:36.482 --> 02:42:39.203]  No, no.
[02:42:40.824 --> 02:42:42.545]  The media is totally controlled.
[02:42:42.565 --> 02:42:46.487]  There's no quote-unquote opposition media at all.
[02:42:46.507 --> 02:42:51.029]  The opposition is completely silenced.
[02:42:52.010 --> 02:43:00.574]  We have no way of voicing our opinions now that the Austrian Freedom Party is basically
[02:43:01.232 --> 02:43:02.192]  It's disintegrated.
[02:43:02.332 --> 02:43:03.492]  It doesn't exist anymore.
[02:43:03.512 --> 02:43:07.393]  We even have no party to vote for.
[02:43:07.633 --> 02:43:12.414]  So I'm not politically, currently I'm not politically represented in Austria.
[02:43:13.314 --> 02:43:19.396]  And you know what happens when people no longer feel represented.
[02:43:19.496 --> 02:43:26.577]  They usually, and we know that from history, you know, it usually leads to some sort of
[02:43:28.007 --> 02:43:32.270]  Revolution or maybe even worse than that, but usually bloodshed.
[02:43:33.651 --> 02:43:37.834]  Now, I certainly won't do that, but go ahead.
[02:43:38.234 --> 02:43:41.376]  What do you feel or hear from the younger generation?
[02:43:41.396 --> 02:43:52.404]  Because if I was in my teens or 20s and I was an Austrian young man or young woman, I would be very terrified and I would
[02:43:53.705 --> 02:43:58.984]  Probably be forming some kind of tribal or gang relationship just to be able to, you know...
[02:44:01.112 --> 02:44:02.113]  It's not happening?
[02:44:02.693 --> 02:44:03.594]  No, no.
[02:44:03.674 --> 02:44:08.397]  There's no resistance of any sort anywhere in Europe.
[02:44:08.458 --> 02:44:15.943]  I mean, you know what happened with the English Defence League, that it was infiltrated and basically destroyed.
[02:44:16.604 --> 02:44:24.810]  And there is no opposition, neither political nor coming directly from the people themselves.
[02:44:25.890 --> 02:44:37.696]  The Austrian youth are more concerned about climate change and skipping school on Fridays to protest climate change than anything else.
[02:44:39.537 --> 02:44:49.622]  Unfortunately, I can't tell you anything, I can't give you any better news than that, because we can't even have clandestine meetings anywhere.
[02:44:51.616 --> 02:44:52.337]  We won't.
[02:44:53.358 --> 02:44:54.599]  There's nothing, honestly.
[02:44:54.659 --> 02:44:58.382]  And people don't believe me when I tell them that when I'm in the U.S.
[02:44:58.743 --> 02:45:00.704]  There is no opposition.
[02:45:01.065 --> 02:45:02.106]  People are giving in.
[02:45:02.946 --> 02:45:10.894]  People are, well, basically, you know, it seems like the situation, it must have been like that in the 1930s.
[02:45:12.715 --> 02:45:14.656]  The Austrian is very complacent.
[02:45:14.696 --> 02:45:19.059]  The Austrian doesn't really do anything until it's too late.
[02:45:19.499 --> 02:45:31.886]  And remember also that the Austrians were at the forefront of persecution among the high-ranking Nazis during Hitler's regime here in Austria.
[02:45:31.906 --> 02:45:35.508]  And that's exactly what I fear is going to happen again.
[02:45:35.528 --> 02:45:37.749]  This is just in our DNA, apparently.
[02:45:37.769 --> 02:45:39.310]  Wow.
[02:45:39.330 --> 02:45:40.851]  That's pretty depressing.
[02:45:41.889 --> 02:45:43.610]  As long as some people are staying to fight.
[02:45:43.950 --> 02:45:47.511]  So there's no Tommy Robinson, it's just Elisabeth Sabadich-Wolf.
[02:45:48.232 --> 02:45:48.652]  That's it.
[02:45:49.112 --> 02:45:51.173]  And even she has been silenced, Matt.
[02:45:51.473 --> 02:45:52.513]  Even I've been silenced.
[02:45:52.613 --> 02:45:57.775]  I no longer do any sort of public speaking anywhere in Europe.
[02:45:58.415 --> 02:45:59.256]  I've been silenced.
[02:45:59.356 --> 02:46:05.478]  I just, you know, I feel like I've done my share here in Europe.
[02:46:05.638 --> 02:46:09.900]  I've done everything I could and I think now it's time for others to take over.
[02:46:10.814 --> 02:46:16.657]  Well, if you can, folks watching this, you can buy her book on Amazon, and that's one way of supporting her.
[02:46:17.357 --> 02:46:19.799]  And you can get my books, too.
[02:46:19.879 --> 02:46:20.839]  Great Christmas gifts.
[02:46:21.599 --> 02:46:27.723]  And if you get them straight from me, from my post office, you don't have to give half the money to Jeff Bezos.
[02:46:29.764 --> 02:46:40.209]  If I may step in, Matt, if people get in touch with me, I can direct them to my manager, and they can also skip Matt Bezos' share in the book.
[02:46:46.325 --> 02:46:55.827]  There's a reason that nutritional supplements are the fastest growing industry, not just in the United States, not just in Europe, but all over the world.
[02:46:56.848 --> 02:47:01.809]  Because the power of Mother Nature that God gave us is simply incredible.
[02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:06.510]  Now, a lot of viewers have noted that I'm more focused,
[02:47:07.622 --> 02:47:08.103]  That's right.
[02:47:23.735 --> 02:47:36.044]  I lose weight, I have more stamina, more energy, more libido, and then I tend to get back in better shape, and then forget about the supplements, even though that's how we fund our operation, and I stop taking the majority of them.
[02:47:36.064 --> 02:47:47.753]  A lot of times, family comes to town for Thanksgiving, and we take the Lazy Susan off the dining table, and then I forget to put it back, and literally, six months later, I'm like, wait, I'm not really taking many of the supplements.
[02:47:48.934 --> 02:47:52.377]  It's when I religiously take our flagship products,
[02:47:53.428 --> 02:47:55.010]  So many great things happen.
[02:47:55.671 --> 02:48:12.411]  So I'm launching for this Black Friday week, and as long as we're able to do this while supplies last, because one of these is not stocked up as much as it should be, I'm going to offer this special that I've named the Change Your Life trifecta pack.
[02:48:13.252 --> 02:48:13.392]  Now,
[02:48:14.943 --> 02:48:18.586]  We've got the great BrainPill Nootropic BrainForce Plus.
[02:48:18.686 --> 02:48:24.291]  We've got the great Triiodine with the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine and two other types to help absorb it.
[02:48:25.773 --> 02:48:30.277]  That's X3 together with this product.
[02:48:32.100 --> 02:48:45.183]  I believe is one of our very best products and that I actually had our designers put together because products like this are the best-selling systems in the world right now and the fastest growing.
[02:48:46.224 --> 02:48:51.765]  So let me show you what's in the 8-pack PowerStack AM PM system.
[02:48:53.735 --> 02:48:54.957]  Look at all of these packets.
[02:48:56.098 --> 02:48:59.121]  13 different pills that you take in the a.m.
[02:48:59.662 --> 02:49:00.343]  and the p.m.
[02:49:00.904 --> 02:49:03.867]  and then this way you don't forget.
[02:49:04.708 --> 02:49:10.315]  So that's why I'm calling this the change your life trifecta pack because if you take
[02:49:11.530 --> 02:49:18.856]  The morning pack and the evening pack, this alone is simply amazing and has changed my life.
[02:49:19.116 --> 02:49:33.507]  All the different supplements that are in it, what they do for you, what they do for your health, what they do as antioxidants, what the fish oil does, what the nootropic does, what the detox does, what the energy does, it's just insane.
[02:49:34.007 --> 02:49:38.851]  It's insane if you take these 13 pills a day, what mother nature has put together.
[02:49:39.091 --> 02:49:39.532]  Because listen,
[02:49:41.291 --> 02:49:47.037]  The top selling packs out there may have $10 a product in it that you take in a month.
[02:49:47.717 --> 02:49:49.018]  This has close to 30.
[02:49:51.380 --> 02:50:01.066]  We went out to the top manufacturer of organic supplements, and we have the daytime pack and the nighttime pack, and we put almost $30 a product into this.
[02:50:01.146 --> 02:50:05.109]  And so this special right now is at cost, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:05.549 --> 02:50:12.494]  You get the Brain Force Plus, you get the Survival Shield X3, and you get the 8-pack Power Stack, all
[02:50:13.474 --> 02:50:17.116]  For $59.95, that's at more than half off.
[02:50:17.356 --> 02:50:19.338]  This is more than a $120 value.
[02:50:19.818 --> 02:50:22.399]  When you put it all together, we are giving this to you at cost.
[02:50:22.479 --> 02:50:29.864]  Even though the X3 and the BrainForce Plus are really huge sellers, this seller that I thought would be our top seller has not sold well.
[02:50:30.364 --> 02:50:34.627]  But it's game-changing and the highest quality supplements you're going to find anywhere.
[02:50:34.947 --> 02:50:36.428]  No one that I know of has ever put out
[02:50:37.128 --> 02:50:39.189]  A daytime, nighttime pack with this type of quality.
[02:50:39.610 --> 02:50:40.690]  This will blow you away.
[02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:41.771]  This will change your life.
[02:50:42.151 --> 02:50:43.152]  All three of these together.
[02:50:43.492 --> 02:50:44.913]  It's incredible and it funds our operation.
