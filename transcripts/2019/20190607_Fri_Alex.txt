[00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:10.827]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:46.311]  There's just been another massacre in Virginia Beach where the shooter used a silencer.
[00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:47.872]  What is your view of silencers?
[00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:48.433]  I don't like it.
[00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:49.754]  Would you like to see those banned?
[00:00:49.754 --> 00:00:51.395]  Well, I'd like to think about it.
[00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:53.777]  I mean, nobody's talked about silencers very much.
[00:00:53.777 --> 00:00:58.120]  They did talk about the bump stock and we had it banned and we're looking at that.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.263]  I'm going to seriously look at it.
[00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:02.884]  I don't love the idea of it.
[00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:03.684]  I don't like the idea.
[00:01:03.684 --> 00:01:04.385]  What's happening is
[00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:06.046]  Crazy.
[00:01:06.046 --> 00:01:08.047]  Okay, it's crazy.
[00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:09.648]  Mark your calendars.
[00:01:09.648 --> 00:01:12.669]  June 6, 2019.
[00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:21.574]  Trump does an interview with Piers Morgan, Mr. Anti-Gun, in England, and says he's seriously looking at banning suppressors or silencers.
[00:01:22.134 --> 00:01:29.660]  I've got an article right here from the ATF admitting that millions of these have been sold and that almost no crimes have been committed.
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.024]  But regardless, people commit crimes with automobiles, they commit crimes with baseball bats.
[00:01:34.024 --> 00:01:42.551]  You don't ban butcher knives or automobiles or baseball bats because they were used in crimes, because criminals used them.
[00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:47.495]  I gave Trump a pass after the Vegas massacre, which turned out to be an Islamic attack they covered up.
[00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:54.388]  Well, he went after bump stocks because bump stocks are basically worthless and are pieces of crap.
[00:01:54.388 --> 00:01:57.108]  But my listener said, Jones, you're wrong.
[00:01:57.108 --> 00:02:06.991]  The fact that Trump got political points talking about this means that when there are future events, he will blame the firearm or accessories.
[00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:08.031]  Well, guess what, listeners?
[00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:09.111]  You're right.
[00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:10.412]  So I'm telling President Trump this.
[00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:13.713]  The Democrats want to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:02:13.713 --> 00:02:14.914]  There's massive pressure to do it.
[00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:17.996]  It's not going to stop criminals committing crimes.
[00:02:17.996 --> 00:02:32.827]  And if you're going to blame the 10 million plus silencer and suppressor owners in this country because some wound up guy in a gun-free zone went and attacked his co-workers and had one in his truck, then that's my line of saying.
[00:02:34.232 --> 00:02:37.634]  President Trump, if you become Hillary Clinton, what's the point of supporting you?
[00:02:37.634 --> 00:02:42.757]  You think you're going to garner support from Piers Morgan and the left by doing things like this?
[00:02:42.757 --> 00:02:45.938]  All you're going to do is turn your base against you.
[00:02:45.938 --> 00:02:49.560]  So I'm going to tell you what I told Piers Morgan on CNN.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.101]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:52.682]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:53.903]  Mao took the guns.
[00:02:53.903 --> 00:02:59.146]  And if you try to take our firearms, 1776 will commence again!
[00:02:59.146 --> 00:02:59.806]  Damn it, Trump!
[00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:04.885]  At least you said at the end of the clip, well, you're not inclined to do it.
[00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:07.327]  Okay, but you're giving it lip service.
[00:03:07.327 --> 00:03:16.718]  Once you ban bump stocks, and that whole fake story of what happened when he knows a fraud, you open the door to blame the tools instead of the psychopaths.
[00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:20.782]  And once you did that, you joined the deep state and the globalists, who are your mortal enemies?
[00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:27.312]  Trump, I want to support you, but dammit, you cross the line on the Second Amendment.
[00:03:27.312 --> 00:03:31.915]  I'm sworn to defend this constitutional republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:35.737]  And you cross that line, you become an enemy of the republic.
[00:03:35.737 --> 00:03:39.960]  Trump, you know the right thing to do.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.560]  You have been warned.
[00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:44.102]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:03:44.102 --> 00:03:45.442]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:03:45.442 --> 00:03:46.483]  Mao took the guns.
[00:03:46.483 --> 00:03:47.963]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:03:47.963 --> 00:03:49.384]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:54.847]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:03:54.847 --> 00:03:59.349]  Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.869]  We will not relinquish them.
[00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:01.790]  Do you understand?
[00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:11.917]  California Senator Dianne Feinstein worked for more than a year to get the Assault Weapons Bill passed in the face of ferocious opposition from the National Rifle Association.
[00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:14.358]  She says she got the best she could.
[00:04:14.358 --> 00:04:28.788]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:04:28.788 --> 00:04:30.049]  I could not do that.
[00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:32.431]  The votes weren't here.
[00:05:01.155 --> 00:05:08.541]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:12.825]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[00:05:12.825 --> 00:05:16.528]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[00:05:22.196 --> 00:05:23.896]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:25.117]  This is racketeering.
[00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:26.237]  This is cartels.
[00:05:26.237 --> 00:05:28.658]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[00:05:28.658 --> 00:05:30.538]  We need it now.
[00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.218]  You can take on Big Ten.
[00:05:32.218 --> 00:05:41.161]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:49.203]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[00:05:49.203 --> 00:05:50.063]  The way to fight back
[00:05:50.703 --> 00:05:55.547]  ...is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[00:05:55.547 --> 00:05:59.310]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:03.866]  Breaking news out of Silicon Valley.
[00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:08.670]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.353]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[00:06:12.353 --> 00:06:16.436]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[00:06:16.436 --> 00:06:19.558]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[00:06:19.558 --> 00:06:26.724]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous.
[00:06:26.724 --> 00:06:27.324]  Dangerous.
[00:06:27.324 --> 00:06:27.925]  Dangerous.
[00:06:27.925 --> 00:06:28.465]  Dangerous.
[00:06:28.465 --> 00:06:29.066]  Dangerous.
[00:06:29.586 --> 00:06:30.767]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:06:30.767 --> 00:06:31.928]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:06:31.928 --> 00:06:34.589]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:37.290]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.391]  Danger, Will Robinson.
[00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:38.991]  Danger.
[00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:40.152]  They call me dangerous.
[00:06:40.152 --> 00:06:41.773]  Danger is my middle name.
[00:06:41.773 --> 00:06:43.854]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[00:06:43.854 --> 00:06:47.076]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[00:06:47.216 --> 00:06:51.879]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.561]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[00:06:53.561 --> 00:06:58.164]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[00:06:58.164 --> 00:07:00.866]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[00:07:00.866 --> 00:07:02.888]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[00:07:02.888 --> 00:07:05.630]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.071]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[00:07:08.071 --> 00:07:09.152]  I want them shut down.
[00:07:09.152 --> 00:07:10.113]  I want them silenced.
[00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:10.833]  I want them muted.
[00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:12.755]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:07:12.935 --> 00:07:14.636]  I want them shut down!
[00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:15.876]  I want them silenced!
[00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:16.757]  I want them muted!
[00:07:16.757 --> 00:07:21.839]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal few.
[00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:30.923]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content.
[00:07:30.923 --> 00:07:39.627]  And we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:44.069]  Through your rules, your rules go against our values, and they are patently un-American.
[00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:51.333]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions, he's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:53.874]  We need a digital Bill of Rights.
[00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:57.776]  They're becoming the public square, and they control how we interact with each other.
[00:07:57.776 --> 00:08:04.820]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane, and you are part of the problem.
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.541]  You are a bad person, you should be censored off the internet.
[00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:08.722]  Bad, yes!
[00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:09.983]  Get out of here, Alex!
[00:08:09.983 --> 00:08:14.485]  InfoWars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[00:08:14.485 --> 00:08:23.590]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.692]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:08:41.098 --> 00:08:41.839]  I'm good.
[00:09:12.695 --> 00:09:20.948]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is June 7th, 2019.
[00:09:20.948 --> 00:09:24.093]  I'm your host on this Friday Worldwide Broadcast.
[00:09:24.093 --> 00:09:27.218]  We're gonna be live here for the next four hours ahead of the War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[00:09:28.342 --> 00:09:33.426]  Well, we have one of the heroes of Benghazi, one of the survivors, John Tigg.
[00:09:33.426 --> 00:09:34.908]  That's his nickname.
[00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:39.592]  John Tigg will be in studio with us with a lot of really key information.
[00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:51.022]  He'll also get into the fact that the movie, 13 Hours, is about 60% accurate and, of course, traces back to the criminal activity and the stand-down that was ordered by Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[00:09:51.522 --> 00:09:53.263]  So that is coming up in the second hour.
[00:09:53.263 --> 00:10:01.306]  We'll also be joined by David J. Lin, a preacher who was arrested for preaching the gospel in Canada.
[00:10:01.306 --> 00:10:06.148]  Yes, they're getting rid of free speech everywhere, but Canada is leading the world.
[00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:09.609]  Only worse is places like North Korea and China.
[00:10:09.609 --> 00:10:10.830]  I'm not kidding.
[00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.551]  It's already that bad.
[00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.930]  So that's coming up.
[00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:22.412]  Also, Dr. Nick Begich, always loaded for bear, will be joining us today and co-hosting in the fourth hour.
[00:10:22.412 --> 00:10:24.113]  Okay.
[00:10:24.113 --> 00:10:26.653]  Let me just do this.
[00:10:26.653 --> 00:10:28.614]  I got a lot of news to cover here, obviously.
[00:10:28.614 --> 00:10:30.334]  And the collapse of the border is accelerating.
[00:10:30.334 --> 00:10:31.694]  We're going to get into all that.
[00:10:31.694 --> 00:10:39.856]  And more dramatic footage of giant caravans just surging over it via flare footage.
[00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:42.177]  But what about President Trump?
[00:10:43.464 --> 00:11:02.413]  What about President Trump and his statement to Piers Morgan that he doesn't like suppressors or silencers and that he would like to see them banned, but he doesn't know if he's going to do that.
[00:11:02.413 --> 00:11:04.834]  Well, A, it's not really up to the President to try to ban stuff.
[00:11:04.834 --> 00:11:05.535]  It's up to Congress.
[00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:16.050]  B, the President shouldn't be supporting that, because suppressors and silencers I know are big in movies, and I understand Trump's from New York, he's not a big gun guy himself.
[00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:20.955]  His sons are, and I know they're totally pro-Second Amendment and have informed their dad before.
[00:11:20.955 --> 00:11:21.916]  They're big hunters as well.
[00:11:22.777 --> 00:11:27.439]  But silencers and suppressors are used in almost no crimes.
[00:11:27.439 --> 00:11:33.221]  You have to go through a further federal background check and pay for a tax stamp to get one.
[00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:35.062]  But they are a dream to shoot.
[00:11:35.062 --> 00:11:39.403]  They make there be less kick on the rifle or handgun, more accurate.
[00:11:39.403 --> 00:11:41.284]  And of course, they're not really silencers.
[00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:47.387]  They're called suppressors because it's not like Hollywood movies where they go, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[00:11:47.387 --> 00:11:51.248]  That's not what silencers or suppressors do.
[00:11:51.688 --> 00:12:09.488]  Really sound like I mean you could have some giant suppressor that could cut sound down to a very low level, but your average suppressor All it does is basically turn it down to something about like About like that and then that way you don't blow your eardrums out does it mess with your neighbors?
[00:12:09.488 --> 00:12:12.592]  It just makes firearms a lot better, and here's the difference
[00:12:13.953 --> 00:12:17.194]  President Trump came out and said, yeah, bump stocks.
[00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:18.294]  They're pieces of crap.
[00:12:18.294 --> 00:12:19.594]  They don't work.
[00:12:19.594 --> 00:12:20.955]  The gun community doesn't like them.
[00:12:20.955 --> 00:12:23.055]  There isn't a lobby for them.
[00:12:23.055 --> 00:12:25.356]  They don't allow for accurate fire, in my view.
[00:12:25.356 --> 00:12:27.076]  There wasn't anybody there to defend them.
[00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:33.098]  And when he first came out and said, yeah, yeah, maybe we'll ban bump stocks, I thought, well, they'll never really do that.
[00:12:33.098 --> 00:12:34.038]  But they did.
[00:12:34.038 --> 00:12:35.298]  And listeners got really mad at me.
[00:12:35.298 --> 00:12:40.140]  They said, you know, you need to be more on Trump for this because next they're going to come out for other things when there's events.
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.280]  And it sells the idea that
[00:12:42.196 --> 00:12:45.397]  The inanimate object is guilty, not the criminal.
[00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:46.937]  And so you watch Jones.
[00:12:46.937 --> 00:12:50.298]  If Trump thinks he gets political points with this, he might go down the line with other things.
[00:12:50.298 --> 00:12:53.238]  Well, he's done it.
[00:12:53.238 --> 00:12:57.239]  Trump looks at silencing the Second Amendment.
[00:12:57.239 --> 00:12:59.699]  And we're going to play a clip from Piers Morgan where he went over this.
[00:12:59.699 --> 00:13:07.381]  I've shot a very powerful report that we're going to repost to the top of InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, which was posted last night.
[00:13:07.381 --> 00:13:08.181]  I shot it last night.
[00:13:09.474 --> 00:13:17.875]  Up here with the crew, my warning to the President, Alex Jones warns Trump 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:22.616]  Everyone needs to go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and get this article with the video.
[00:13:22.616 --> 00:13:24.897]  It's a powerful four-minute report.
[00:13:24.897 --> 00:13:26.217]  You need to send it to WhiteHouse.gov.
[00:13:26.217 --> 00:13:28.497]  You need to retweet it at Don Jr.
[00:13:28.497 --> 00:13:33.938]  You need to retweet it at the entire Trump family, at the NRA and everybody else because here's the deal.
[00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:37.379]  The NRA tacitly supported banning bump stocks.
[00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:43.824]  Again, there's such pieces of junk that instinctively I didn't really defend it.
[00:13:43.824 --> 00:13:48.028]  But it set the precedent for now them to go after really legitimate things.
[00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:51.331]  And by the way, the gun industry has been sued thousands of times.
[00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.013]  The gun industry, since Trump got in, is losing money.
[00:13:54.013 --> 00:13:55.535]  Remington and others.
[00:13:55.535 --> 00:13:59.979]  Hundreds of companies have gone bankrupt, including our oldest firearms maker, Remington.
[00:13:59.979 --> 00:14:01.640]  And so it's been suppressors.
[00:14:02.481 --> 00:14:06.202]  And everybody already has guns, firearms, going out and getting them.
[00:14:06.202 --> 00:14:09.684]  I have been looking at going ahead and buying some suppressors.
[00:14:09.684 --> 00:14:15.246]  And you can store them at places like The Range here in South Austin.
[00:14:15.246 --> 00:14:22.028]  And then while your paperwork goes through for a few months, you can go shoot it there at The Range or other facilities where it's kept.
[00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.229]  And then you get to have your suppressor.
[00:14:24.229 --> 00:14:31.752]  And then that way, oh my gosh, if you're out in the woods shooting or you're wherever you are, it just makes shooting a dream.
[00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:34.834]  Once you shoot suppressed, you just don't want to go back.
[00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:38.417]  And I've been so busy, I haven't gotten suppressors yet.
[00:14:38.417 --> 00:14:52.849]  But one of my friends, Shane Steiner, he's got suppressors for Lapua rifles, and he's got suppressors for .308s, and he's got suppressors for .45s, and just everything.
[00:14:52.849 --> 00:14:57.853]  And it's so much fun to be able to do that.
[00:14:57.853 --> 00:15:00.315]  There's his Lapua without the suppressor on it.
[00:15:00.315 --> 00:15:01.656]  They were able to pull that up pretty quick.
[00:15:02.296 --> 00:15:03.577]  That was about five, six years ago.
[00:15:03.577 --> 00:15:04.177]  I stopped shooting.
[00:15:04.177 --> 00:15:07.099]  He's got a big suppressor on it now.
[00:15:07.099 --> 00:15:12.142]  And again, it's not like a movie where you can't hear it when he fires.
[00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:19.975]  I got really mad yesterday, and I stand by the video I put out that is a warning to Trump, and we're going to re-air it a little bit later in the hour.
[00:15:19.975 --> 00:15:22.115]  If you missed it, I aired it right at the start of the show.
[00:15:22.115 --> 00:15:26.616]  Some stations don't carry that first five minutes, but this is a big deal.
[00:15:26.616 --> 00:15:39.099]  Trump's doing a great job on so many fronts, and in fighting incredible obstacles, but if he's going to meet with Piers Morgan, and he's going to start saying this, and he's got a history of following through on what he says, we better be concerned.
[00:15:39.099 --> 00:15:40.720]  But it's also Trump better be concerned.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.660]  Let me tell you something.
[00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:45.731]  Trump's base will walk on him and he'll lose the 2020 election.
[00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:49.394]  This is absolutely self-sabotage.
[00:15:49.394 --> 00:15:51.355]  And again, Trump has a blind spot.
[00:15:51.355 --> 00:15:52.456]  He's a golfer.
[00:15:52.456 --> 00:15:55.338]  He is not a firearms enthusiast.
[00:15:55.338 --> 00:15:58.000]  Trump, get with the program.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.201]  Listen to your sons.
[00:15:59.201 --> 00:16:01.103]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[00:16:01.103 --> 00:16:04.325]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[00:16:04.325 --> 00:16:05.946]  Savory and delicious.
[00:16:05.946 --> 00:16:08.769]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:09.169]  Awesome.
[00:16:09.429 --> 00:16:12.513]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[00:16:12.513 --> 00:16:14.075]  NASA PAC Technology.
[00:16:14.075 --> 00:16:14.696]  Bacon.
[00:16:14.696 --> 00:16:18.861]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon.
[00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:20.282]  Or warm and serve.
[00:16:20.282 --> 00:16:22.345]  Life-saving, ready to eat bacon.
[00:16:22.345 --> 00:16:24.287]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:32.995]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[00:16:56.573 --> 00:16:58.776]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[00:16:58.776 --> 00:17:03.343]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:17:03.343 --> 00:17:05.426]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:17:05.426 --> 00:17:06.768]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:17:07.148 --> 00:17:13.698]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:17:13.698 --> 00:17:18.785]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:17:18.785 --> 00:17:23.492]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[00:17:23.912 --> 00:17:27.034]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[00:20:03.317 --> 00:20:05.941]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:35.523 --> 00:20:36.083]  We're good to go.
[00:20:57.751 --> 00:21:10.625]  Because he quoted the host of Vox, who's been given $250 million by NBC a year, who quotes and calls himself, you know, we're queer, we're here, we're here to stay, all this stuff.
[00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:12.627]  And he goes, well, self-described queer.
[00:21:12.627 --> 00:21:15.910]  They're like, oh my God, you called me a queer.
[00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:16.631]  You can't do that.
[00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:18.833]  These are public figures, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:19.801 --> 00:21:22.742]  So now they're trying to have him banned as well.
[00:21:22.742 --> 00:21:25.063]  This is never going to end.
[00:21:25.063 --> 00:21:31.826]  And I've got one of my constitutional lawyers here for all the globalist attacks they've got going against us right now.
[00:21:31.826 --> 00:21:36.568]  Famous constitutional lawyer, First Amendment lawyer, Norm Pattis.
[00:21:36.568 --> 00:21:44.791]  And I was telling him in my office this morning about how I have a street preacher coming on who was arrested and the Canadian government says for criticizing homosexuality.
[00:21:46.186 --> 00:21:47.747]  He said, that's not possible.
[00:21:47.747 --> 00:21:48.728]  Canada has free speech.
[00:21:48.728 --> 00:21:53.211]  People don't even know what's happening in Europe or what's happening in Canada.
[00:21:53.211 --> 00:22:03.759]  Canada is worse than places like Sweden, where they arrest you if you report crime statistics that Muslims have committed.
[00:22:03.759 --> 00:22:12.986]  Now they just had the head police officer of the Netherlands had to resign for covering up Islamic crimes and Islamic terror.
[00:22:13.851 --> 00:22:14.471]  Well guess what?
[00:22:14.471 --> 00:22:24.656]  YouTube, there's an article on InfoWars.com, just came out last night with new rules and they said if you discuss someone's immigration status, that is hate.
[00:22:24.656 --> 00:22:25.956]  So they can call anything they want hate.
[00:22:25.956 --> 00:22:28.257]  They can call mothers milk hate.
[00:22:28.257 --> 00:22:35.580]  And so now, thousands of accounts are being deleted in just the last day of mainline conservatives.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:40.042]  So first they came for me.
[00:22:40.042 --> 00:22:41.583]  First they came for Alex Jones.
[00:22:43.263 --> 00:22:49.470]  Build a straw man, a horrible straw man that I'm not so people wouldn't defend me.
[00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.594]  And then once that domino fell, it was everybody else.
[00:22:52.594 --> 00:22:55.517]  Now I'm going to get more into Trump coming out against.
[00:22:56.912 --> 00:23:00.095]  Suppressors, silencers, and just how incredibly dangerous that is.
[00:23:00.095 --> 00:23:05.479]  The idea that if someone uses something in the commission of a crime, that it's going to be banned.
[00:23:05.479 --> 00:23:09.702]  Even though there's hardly any cases of suppressors being used in crimes.
[00:23:09.702 --> 00:23:17.949]  In fact, even in my report to the President that we just aired earlier, I show mainstream news, the FBI admitting, the ATF admitting it's almost never been used in crime.
[00:23:17.949 --> 00:23:21.452]  The supposed shooter in Virginia last week had one in his vehicle.
[00:23:23.442 --> 00:23:25.944]  So if he used a butcher knife, would we ban those?
[00:23:25.944 --> 00:23:30.429]  But this is the psychology of where these individuals are going.
[00:23:30.429 --> 00:23:34.493]  But I wanted to get to a report about Steven Crowder.
[00:23:34.493 --> 00:23:41.019]  A flashback from June 7th.
[00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:41.560]  That's amazing.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.202]  August 10th, 2018.
[00:23:47.202 --> 00:23:49.642]  So this was August 10th, 2018.
[00:23:49.642 --> 00:24:00.586]  Here we are, 10 months later, on June 7th, on this Friday edition, and I laid out exactly how the next bannings would take place after I was banned last year.
[00:24:00.586 --> 00:24:02.947]  Here it is.
[00:24:02.947 --> 00:24:10.050]  We're saying, when we get Jones down, we want Steven Crowder, and we want all these other people down.
[00:24:11.192 --> 00:24:14.933]  Steven Crowder, even with shadowbanning, his average video has 2 million views.
[00:24:14.933 --> 00:24:16.813]  Everything he does is a hit.
[00:24:16.813 --> 00:24:21.934]  I go to my kid's school, I go to mainline high schools with my kids for sporting events.
[00:24:21.934 --> 00:24:24.815]  Do you know Steven Crowder?
[00:24:24.815 --> 00:24:28.936]  They know who I am, but you know Paul Watson, he works for you.
[00:24:28.936 --> 00:24:30.616]  You know Steven Crowder.
[00:24:30.616 --> 00:24:39.558]  So, smart, funny, good-looking guys who are very appealing across the board and promoting America, they want them shut down, period.
[00:24:40.572 --> 00:24:42.673]  And now, it's been announced.
[00:24:42.673 --> 00:24:48.975]  He is the next target.
[00:24:48.975 --> 00:24:51.616]  It's crazy to watch their giant sigh off.
[00:24:51.616 --> 00:25:01.560]  There's an article I'm going to get to, what the intelligence community's insurance policy on the president would look like.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.260]  It's a Hill article.
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:08.202]  And if you read what they're doing to Trump, and then think about what they're doing to Infowars, this is the blueprint for everybody.
[00:25:10.796 --> 00:25:15.098]  Julian Assange has been on house arrest, the Ecuadorian embassy for six years.
[00:25:15.098 --> 00:25:18.160]  Tommy Robinson, you know, prison.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.321]  They're trying to de-platform me and destroy me and sue me out of existence.
[00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:28.305]  This is what it looks like in 21st century information warfare to retake this country from the globalists and from the shycomps.
[00:25:28.305 --> 00:25:31.467]  And it's all coming out.
[00:25:31.467 --> 00:25:33.748]  So let's go ahead and get into what's happening.
[00:25:35.609 --> 00:25:47.559]  When they started deplatforming us two weeks ago, I said, as soon as they're successful with us, and I said, and they're going to do it, they're going to come after everybody else.
[00:25:47.559 --> 00:25:51.742]  Because I was reading what the Democratic Party websites were saying last week.
[00:25:51.742 --> 00:25:59.989]  They were saying, when we get Jones down, we want Steven Crowder, and we want all these other people down.
[00:25:59.989 --> 00:26:03.872]  But Steven Crowder, even with shadowbanning, his average video has 2 million views.
[00:26:03.872 --> 00:26:04.833]  Everything he does is a hit.
[00:26:05.737 --> 00:26:10.838]  I go to my kids' school, I go to mainline high schools with my kids for sporting events.
[00:26:10.838 --> 00:26:13.719]  Do you know Steven Crowder?
[00:26:13.719 --> 00:26:17.860]  They know who I am, but you know Paul Watson, he works for you.
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.521]  You know Steven Crowder.
[00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:28.463]  So, smart, funny, good-looking guys who are very appealing across the board and promoting America, they want them shut down, period.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.582]  And now, it's been announced.
[00:26:31.582 --> 00:26:33.103]  He is the next target.
[00:26:33.103 --> 00:26:35.725]  And man, he's really polite, but effective.
[00:26:35.725 --> 00:26:41.310]  And if they're calling him hate, because you can take stuff I say out of context and twist it.
[00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:44.072]  Crowder is very scripted, and I don't mean that in a mean way.
[00:26:44.072 --> 00:26:49.237]  He's a famous actor in his own right, famous child actor, so he's able to then really do a lot of preparation and do what he does.
[00:26:49.237 --> 00:26:52.780]  And it's because he is effective and is getting liberals to walk away is why they want him shut down.
[00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:53.761]  But I'm digressing.
[00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:54.801]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:26:54.801 --> 00:26:57.544]  They wouldn't make such a bold,
[00:27:00.245 --> 00:27:11.350]  Full-throated attack on the First Amendment and absolute racketeering, corporate coordination between $3 trillion of capital.
[00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:18.573]  You take the six companies that have blacklisted me, and they call it a blacklist, they're not calling it censorship, unpersoning, putting me into the phantom zone.
[00:27:18.573 --> 00:27:21.955]  $3 trillion is what they're estimating, about $3.1 trillion.
[00:27:25.205 --> 00:27:32.590]  So three plus trillion dollars of companies that have moved to China are muscling in on America and they demonize me first.
[00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:38.554]  I'm the target because Hillary called me dark art, knows we were effective at rebooting Americana.
[00:27:38.554 --> 00:27:40.216]  And they know that we're growing exponentially.
[00:27:40.216 --> 00:27:40.796]  So they got scared.
[00:27:40.796 --> 00:27:42.877]  They've already dialed back 93 percent.
[00:27:42.877 --> 00:27:51.383]  All the other conservative and national sites, any type of pro-military group, pro-Trump group, they're all banned.
[00:27:51.383 --> 00:27:52.144]  They're all blocked.
[00:27:54.512 --> 00:27:56.273]  Everybody else is already 93%.
[00:27:56.273 --> 00:27:58.314]  Paul Watson is left alone.
[00:27:58.314 --> 00:28:00.114]  He works with Infowars.
[00:28:00.114 --> 00:28:00.915]  But he's 97%.
[00:28:00.915 --> 00:28:03.896]  Because we have the analytics.
[00:28:03.896 --> 00:28:05.517]  We have the server logs.
[00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:08.678]  When they turn us off, man, they just flip a switch.
[00:28:08.678 --> 00:28:23.144]  So, they wouldn't make a super ultra crazy bold move like this, which is right out of the Soviet Union, right out of Nazi Germany, unless they are planning to go for broke on every front.
[00:28:28.451 --> 00:28:31.453]  From last August, three days after the big massive ban.
[00:28:31.453 --> 00:28:35.296]  Now they're banning positive mention of my name or our websites.
[00:28:35.296 --> 00:28:43.662]  This is beyond the old Soviet Union, but you can override them by spreading the links to InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:43.662 --> 00:28:45.383]  This is a real fight though.
[00:28:45.383 --> 00:28:48.565]  We'll be right back with the globalists imploding the border, the latest developments.
[00:28:48.565 --> 00:28:49.346]  Stay with us.
[00:28:49.346 --> 00:28:50.026]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:28:59.475 --> 00:29:00.997]  Oh, these pains.
[00:29:00.997 --> 00:29:03.519]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:05.321]  I've got to get some relief.
[00:29:05.321 --> 00:29:11.026]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.

[00:32:00.397 --> 00:32:04.639]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:32:04.639 --> 00:32:15.043]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[00:32:15.043 --> 00:32:18.165]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale.
[00:32:18.345 --> 00:32:18.665]  Of course.
[00:32:34.477 --> 00:32:43.644]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[00:32:43.644 --> 00:32:52.250]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.572]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment.
[00:32:55.572 --> 00:32:58.955]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[00:33:03.271 --> 00:33:05.935]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:23.613 --> 00:33:28.495]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:28.495 --> 00:33:37.378]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[00:34:09.421 --> 00:34:25.036]  Our story of what's happening currently to the United States and our borders starts back in 1993 at a man named Ross Perot.
[00:34:25.036 --> 00:34:28.500]  Do you remember that Texan telling you that, listen...
[00:34:29.872 --> 00:34:33.795]  About 10 years ago, we got rid of the controls we have with Canada.
[00:34:33.795 --> 00:34:39.298]  Canada got rid of those, and their auto workers were making $45 an hour, and our auto workers were making $18 an hour.
[00:34:39.298 --> 00:34:44.261]  Now, our auto workers' pay went down, and theirs went down.
[00:34:44.261 --> 00:34:53.107]  Now, when you move our jobs to Mexico, where they're paid about $1 an hour, it's not going to raise our pay.
[00:34:53.107 --> 00:34:56.349]  It's going to lower it for Canada and the United States.
[00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:57.470]  Now, we can play all those clips.
[00:34:58.783 --> 00:35:01.806]  Played them many times and everybody remembers it.
[00:35:01.806 --> 00:35:14.499]  So in 1993, there were zero auto workers in Mexico producing vehicles for the United States.
[00:35:14.499 --> 00:35:21.946]  Mexico was so anti-America that there was only a VW plant down there and Mexico would not buy U.S.
[00:35:21.946 --> 00:35:22.286]  vehicles.
[00:35:23.325 --> 00:35:29.227]  Yes, Mexico hates the United States guts for most of its history, because it's lost a bunch of wars with us.
[00:35:29.227 --> 00:35:32.148]  But I digress.
[00:35:32.148 --> 00:35:38.611]  If you expand on all of that, now you've got Central and South America collapsing.
[00:35:38.611 --> 00:35:45.974]  As I told you last year, the numbers are now in, most of the illegal aliens aren't coming from Mexico now, they're coming from Venezuela.
[00:35:47.793 --> 00:35:52.416]  Venezuela, another communist country that has completely collapsed.
[00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:58.621]  So now we have up to a third of the cars sold in this country being made in Mexico.
[00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:01.543]  And has that helped Mexico?
[00:36:01.543 --> 00:36:08.148]  Has that stopped uneducated people wanting to come up here to have their babies for free and get on welfare and all the rest of it?
[00:36:08.148 --> 00:36:09.389]  No.
[00:36:09.389 --> 00:36:10.610]  In fact, it's made it worse.
[00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:14.473]  So when Ross Perot talked about the giant sucking sound,
[00:36:15.691 --> 00:36:28.363]  When he talked about what was going to happen with all of that, in 1993, 27, 28 years ago, was he right or was he wrong?
[00:36:28.363 --> 00:36:31.046]  And the answer is, he was right.
[00:36:31.046 --> 00:36:34.229]  Now, we've seen the same playbook of Europe.
[00:36:34.229 --> 00:36:37.812]  There's over 15 million military age men have come into Europe the last 10 years.
[00:36:37.812 --> 00:36:39.834]  That's a conservative EU number, it's probably much higher.
[00:36:40.703 --> 00:36:48.007]  Almost all the military-age men, upwards of 90%, never got jobs and live on welfare because the government wants them there on welfare.
[00:36:48.007 --> 00:37:02.575]  Thousands of cars are torched every month in Europe, thousands of rapes, stabbings, acid attacks, all of it, importing a group from caveman-level squalor in North Africa and the worst countries in the Middle East.
[00:37:02.575 --> 00:37:06.918]  We're getting the worst percentage off the bottom
[00:37:08.004 --> 00:37:11.045]  Of these already very, very dangerous, out-of-control countries.
[00:37:11.045 --> 00:37:12.946]  And they've been taught to hate America.
[00:37:12.946 --> 00:37:17.608]  They've been taught by the left on top of it to exploit it and to exploit Europe.
[00:37:17.608 --> 00:37:20.549]  And it is a nightmare scenario.
[00:37:20.549 --> 00:37:24.750]  Now, inner Nancy Pelosi.
[00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:28.152]  We have a clip of this, if we can cue it up.
[00:37:28.152 --> 00:37:34.574]  Nancy Pelosi says that we just won't be America anymore if we don't just let all these groups in.
[00:37:34.574 --> 00:37:37.135]  America's been the most open country in the world, but if you go back,
[00:37:38.519 --> 00:37:51.466]  If you go back to everything that we've seen unfolding at places like Ellis Island and everywhere else, you got checked, you got quarantined for three months on average.
[00:37:52.808 --> 00:38:03.197]  None of that's being done and now every day there's a new video of 200 Africans, 1,000 Mexicans, 2,000 Venezuelans pouring in en masse.
[00:38:03.197 --> 00:38:08.261]  Go to newswars.com and raise the alarm because the left and the globalists don't want you to see this.
[00:38:08.261 --> 00:38:14.366]  Remember just a few months ago they were saying Trump was making it all up.
[00:38:14.366 --> 00:38:15.547]  Remember that?
[00:38:15.547 --> 00:38:16.909]  Trump was making it up.
[00:38:16.909 --> 00:38:18.550]  There wasn't a border crisis.
[00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:19.651]  There wasn't caravans.
[00:38:19.651 --> 00:38:20.792]  It didn't exist.
[00:38:23.973 --> 00:38:26.834]  Think about that.
[00:38:26.834 --> 00:38:32.816]  And now they say there is a border crisis, but it's Trump's fault, and we've got to give everything free to these people.
[00:38:32.816 --> 00:38:33.997]  Newswars.com.
[00:38:33.997 --> 00:38:35.097]  Pelosi.
[00:38:35.097 --> 00:38:40.459]  If we close the door to immigrants, we won't be the country we were anymore.
[00:38:40.459 --> 00:38:41.760]  What does that mean?
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:50.143]  We're not the country we were because we're not checking people for diseases or crime, and when they do check them, one third of the children
[00:38:51.292 --> 00:38:57.558]  ...are not related genetically in genetic tests and they tell ICE, we've been kidnapped.
[00:38:57.558 --> 00:39:00.681]  I was grabbed out of a town in southern Mexico.
[00:39:00.681 --> 00:39:03.704]  These men are from Venezuela.
[00:39:03.704 --> 00:39:06.967]  But children are the golden ticket.
[00:39:06.967 --> 00:39:12.893]  And under Obama, he would just let aid groups, Democrat groups, come with the buses and disappear the children.
[00:39:12.893 --> 00:39:15.115]  And the Senate report admitted, even the Washington Post admitted,
[00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:23.576]  That many thousands of children were put into sex trafficking as young as four years old!
[00:39:23.576 --> 00:39:30.823]  And the Democrats say MS-13 are all God's children.
[00:39:30.823 --> 00:39:32.985]  If you're a radio listener, you have to understand something.
[00:39:32.985 --> 00:39:39.211]  For TV viewers, they're seeing everything I say put on screen by that crew, who in live time is searching what I say.
[00:39:39.977 --> 00:39:42.999]  The Senate report, the one-third being kidnapped kids.
[00:39:42.999 --> 00:39:45.900]  One-third kidnapped kids?
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.222]  Five thousand a week they're catching.
[00:39:49.222 --> 00:39:52.443]  God knows how many they're not catching.
[00:39:52.443 --> 00:39:56.525]  Some estimates are for every person they catch, they don't catch two.
[00:39:56.525 --> 00:40:01.167]  So, three times, double, quadruple, we don't know.
[00:40:01.167 --> 00:40:06.050]  And now it's groups of Africans who are paying smugglers to bring them here.
[00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:07.951]  And the UN is paying to fly them here.
[00:40:08.993 --> 00:40:16.039]  And the Vatican is paying, and George Soros gives them plane tickets, bus tickets.
[00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:22.365]  But if they can't get in a port of entry, they don't have a visa, they just fly into Guatemala.
[00:40:22.365 --> 00:40:34.736]  And then they pay the smugglers, the coyotes, and Soros gives them each, man, woman, and child, $1,000, with no name on it, from Visa and MasterCard.
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:46.155]  Meanwhile, Visa and MasterCard have announced they're hiring human rights commissions from the Southern Poverty Law Center to watch what you buy and who you support, and that if you buy from the NRA, they may get rid of your credit card.
[00:40:46.155 --> 00:40:46.917]  I'm not kidding.
[00:40:46.917 --> 00:40:50.782]  And LA passed a law that if you are a member of the NRA, you must tell
[00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:59.983]  The government, if you work for the city or are a contractor, and then they say you will be fired and you will lose your contracting job.
[00:40:59.983 --> 00:41:02.544]  This is terrorism!
[00:41:02.544 --> 00:41:05.966]  This is Big Brother on steroids and then some!
[00:41:05.966 --> 00:41:12.809]  And it's all out of control and it's all only getting worse by the millisecond.
[00:41:14.033 --> 00:41:18.837]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the corporate world waging war on the people.
[00:41:18.837 --> 00:41:21.680]  And then Pelosi says, we're not America anymore.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:28.826]  If we don't let tens of thousands of people pour in with little kidnapped children, one third of them, not with their parents, little babies.
[00:41:29.938 --> 00:41:34.422]  Marching through the desert with kidnapped children, and then five children have died.
[00:41:34.422 --> 00:41:40.666]  I can't believe it's not higher in the last few months in Border Patrol custody, because they get here with deadly diseases.
[00:41:40.666 --> 00:41:45.950]  Sometimes they die before they even get to the hospital, and then it's America's fault!
[00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:51.935]  Not the Democrats, not the UN, not Soros, setting it up, staging it, telling the people to come here.
[00:41:51.935 --> 00:41:52.956]  No!
[00:41:52.956 --> 00:41:54.377]  It's America's fault!
[00:41:54.377 --> 00:41:56.639]  It's your fault!
[00:41:56.639 --> 00:41:59.281]  And yeah, you can say, Trump's better than, uh,
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:03.382]  Better than Obama or better than the Democrats on this.
[00:42:03.382 --> 00:42:06.083]  Yeah, he's putting tariffs on the Mexicans if they don't do this.
[00:42:06.083 --> 00:42:12.667]  And then even Fox News is like, oh, it's terrible to pay more for tequila and $200 more for a car and 30 cents more for an avocado.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.242]  We've been sold out by globalism.
[00:42:19.242 --> 00:42:20.202]  We've lost our jobs.
[00:42:20.202 --> 00:42:21.504]  We've lost our high pay.
[00:42:21.504 --> 00:42:35.216]  We've lost the middle class on this, and then now Trump tries to put pressure on Mexico to not organize the invasion of the country, with the Mexican president admitting it's an invasion, with the head envoy from Mexico saying that they're at war with America!
[00:42:36.348 --> 00:42:44.070]  Well I tell you what then, narco-terrorist state, if you're at war with us with the UN, how about we throw the UN out of the US and cut its damn funding?
[00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:45.850]  And that's what needs to happen.
[00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:50.051]  The truth is, Trump hadn't even taken the gloves off yet.
[00:42:50.051 --> 00:42:52.312]  And the left's saying he's the one that's a criminal.
[00:42:52.312 --> 00:42:54.592]  We're gonna play all these clips and more straight ahead.
[00:42:54.592 --> 00:42:58.613]  But if you're not pissed, and if you're not spreading the word, something's wrong with you because this is war.

[00:44:17.115 --> 00:44:17.896]  Sports broadcast.
[00:44:17.896 --> 00:44:18.376]  Spreads the word.
[00:44:18.376 --> 00:44:19.677]  It's a great conversation piece.
[00:44:19.677 --> 00:44:20.758]  It's 33% off.
[00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:22.960]  If we sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.

[00:44:26.042 --> 00:44:28.344]  DNA Force Plus, that is such a huge deal.
[00:44:28.344 --> 00:44:30.986]  That is the best CoQ10, PQQ system.

[00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:40.753]  TurboForce, which is just tearing our energy clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[00:44:40.753 --> 00:44:42.735]  Ultimate FemaleForce is incredible as well.
[00:44:42.735 --> 00:44:44.716]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[00:44:44.716 --> 00:44:47.518]  All of the Force products, it's got Force in the name.

[00:46:09.795 --> 00:46:18.798]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:46:18.798 --> 00:46:28.880]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:37.403]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.

[00:46:39.584 --> 00:46:40.745]  You must experience it.
[00:46:40.745 --> 00:46:47.749]  It is a total game changer when it comes to easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:46:47.749 --> 00:46:49.269]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[00:46:49.269 --> 00:46:50.750]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:57.454]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:46:57.454 --> 00:47:02.877]  Turbo Force at m4slive.com.
[00:47:02.877 --> 00:47:05.539]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:29.784 --> 00:47:32.465]  Welcome back, my friends, on this live Friday edition.
[00:47:32.465 --> 00:47:37.626]  I know I say this every broadcast because this isn't your regular broadcast.
[00:47:37.626 --> 00:47:39.507]  We're just trying to be entertaining.
[00:47:39.507 --> 00:47:41.527]  I know you're an amazing activist audience.
[00:47:41.527 --> 00:47:42.247]  You're in the arena.
[00:47:42.247 --> 00:47:44.468]  This is how we defeat the globalists.
[00:47:44.468 --> 00:47:47.029]  I've read their public psychological warfare manuals.
[00:47:47.029 --> 00:47:47.849]  We've published them.
[00:47:47.849 --> 00:47:48.409]  We've put them out.
[00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:57.099]  A lot of this stuff's declassified from the left, out of the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, and they've got their embeds in all the different U.S.
[00:47:57.099 --> 00:47:59.241]  government and European Union agencies.
[00:47:59.241 --> 00:48:00.863]  They want to break up the family.
[00:48:00.863 --> 00:48:02.085]  They want to get rid of free speech.
[00:48:02.085 --> 00:48:03.546]  They want to flood us with Islamists.
[00:48:03.546 --> 00:48:06.350]  You already know all this, and we've got all their own admissions.
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.882]  But they also want to just overwhelm you where you give up.
[00:48:11.882 --> 00:48:13.684]  I'm doing the opposite here.
[00:48:13.684 --> 00:48:22.610]  I'm agitating with the reality to get people pissed, to get people off the couch, to realize this is an existential threat, so we don't just give up to it.
[00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:25.292]  Now, I always naturally did that my 25 years on air.
[00:48:25.292 --> 00:48:38.042]  It wasn't probably until 10 years ago I started reading declassified, you know, globalist psychological operations manuals and linking to them and writing articles about them and showing them to you.
[00:48:39.005 --> 00:48:42.186]  But they are literally trying to break your will.
[00:48:42.186 --> 00:48:45.347]  Well, the answer to that is saying, I'm going to fight back.
[00:48:45.347 --> 00:48:50.469]  And the way the body and the brain works is once you start fighting back, you get stronger, they get weaker.
[00:48:50.469 --> 00:48:59.072]  And they know via Trump and via a lot of folks, America is coming back and America is getting its focus again.
[00:48:59.072 --> 00:49:01.673]  That's why I really support the president.
[00:49:01.673 --> 00:49:05.774]  And I've been persecuted a lot for supporting the president, which lets you know that the president overall is good.
[00:49:05.774 --> 00:49:07.935]  But when he goes on Piers Morgan and lip services,
[00:49:08.792 --> 00:49:15.194]  Banning gun accessories every time there's a new event.
[00:49:15.194 --> 00:49:16.975]  There's 350 million people in this country.
[00:49:16.975 --> 00:49:17.795]  There's going to be murders.
[00:49:17.795 --> 00:49:18.976]  There's going to be killings.
[00:49:18.976 --> 00:49:21.057]  There's bad people in the world.
[00:49:21.057 --> 00:49:30.200]  And said that he's going to ban suppressors or that he's going to try to ban silencers when they're almost using no crime.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:35.582]  Is an example of how much danger we're in because the Democrats just say repeal the whole Second Amendment now.
[00:49:35.582 --> 00:49:37.023]  Remember they used to deny that.
[00:49:37.964 --> 00:49:41.265]  But let's get back to the border first and I'll get back into the Second Amendment.
[00:49:41.265 --> 00:49:42.085]  Here's Pelosi.
[00:49:42.085 --> 00:49:49.146]  You do have to remember the values that freedom isn't free.
[00:49:49.146 --> 00:49:51.646]  And part of that freedom is who we are as Americans.
[00:49:51.646 --> 00:49:55.167]  And who we are as Americans, no one said it better than Ronald Reagan.
[00:49:55.167 --> 00:50:05.969]  Ronald Reagan had the biggest voice for welcoming people to our country and that we cannot close the door or else we won't be the country that leads the world.
[00:50:06.869 --> 00:50:32.236]  And again, for TV viewers, let's just roll the last few days of giant hordes of Africans, Venezuelans, and others just surging over the border, climbing right over walls, right over fences, collapsing everything, and then being grabbed up by the Democrat-controlled courts and given free welfare, free baby births, free everything, and then one out of nine ever show up to an immigration hearing.
[00:50:32.236 --> 00:50:32.996]  They're just here.
[00:50:33.931 --> 00:50:35.913]  A permanent underclass.
[00:50:35.913 --> 00:50:39.775]  And again, I'm all for immigrants, people coming here, people coming here getting jobs.
[00:50:39.775 --> 00:50:45.119]  I've got people from around the world that work here, you know, who are college interns and things, but you know, paid interns.
[00:50:45.119 --> 00:50:47.041]  I'm not against people from Mexico or anywhere else.
[00:50:47.041 --> 00:50:55.006]  I'm against total lawlessness and no border and the lawlessness of Mexico and Venezuela and all these other countries coming here.
[00:50:55.006 --> 00:50:58.709]  It's so incredibly dangerous.
[00:50:58.709 --> 00:50:59.209]  But you know what?
[00:50:59.209 --> 00:51:00.851]  Speaking of Trump, I'm going to go to this right now.
[00:51:01.971 --> 00:51:05.353]  Because this is so central, and it deals with everything we're talking about.
[00:51:05.353 --> 00:51:19.840]  Here is my emergency warning to the President about where he's going with this, and how dangerous it is, and how it will destroy the support he has in his base, and he will lose in 2020 if he continues down this path.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:25.043]  So the same warning I gave Piers Morgan, I now have to give the President with what he said to Piers Morgan.
[00:51:25.043 --> 00:51:25.303]  Here it is.
[00:51:27.827 --> 00:51:32.949]  There's just been another massacre in Virginia Beach where the shooter used a silencer.
[00:51:32.949 --> 00:51:35.090]  What is your view of silencers?
[00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:36.391]  Would you like to see those back?
[00:51:36.391 --> 00:51:38.032]  Well, I'd like to think about it.
[00:51:38.032 --> 00:51:40.413]  I mean, nobody's talked about silencers very much.
[00:51:40.413 --> 00:51:44.775]  They did talk about the bump stock that we had at band and we're looking at that.
[00:51:44.775 --> 00:51:47.916]  I'm going to seriously look at it.
[00:51:47.916 --> 00:51:49.537]  I don't love the idea of it.
[00:51:49.537 --> 00:51:50.937]  I don't like the idea of what's happening.
[00:51:52.478 --> 00:51:52.678]  Crazy.
[00:51:52.678 --> 00:51:54.700]  Okay, it's crazy.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.301]  Mark your calendars.
[00:51:56.301 --> 00:51:58.163]  June 6, 2019.
[00:51:58.163 --> 00:52:08.212]  Trump does an interview with Piers Morgan, Mr. Anti-Gun, in England, and says he's seriously looking at banning suppressors or silencers.
[00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:16.316]  I've got an article right here from the ATF admitting that millions of these have been sold and that almost no crimes have been committed.
[00:52:16.316 --> 00:52:20.679]  But regardless, people commit crimes with automobiles, they commit crimes with baseball bats.
[00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:29.204]  You don't ban butcher knives or automobiles or baseball bats because they were using crimes, because criminals used them.
[00:52:29.204 --> 00:52:34.147]  I gave Trump a pass after the Vegas massacre, which turned out to be an Islamic attack they covered up.
[00:52:35.322 --> 00:52:41.046]  Well, he went after bump stocks because bump stocks are basically worthless and are pieces of crap.
[00:52:41.046 --> 00:52:43.767]  But my listeners said, Jones, you're wrong.
[00:52:43.767 --> 00:52:53.653]  The fact that Trump got political points talking about this means that when there are future events, he will blame the firearm or accessories.
[00:52:53.653 --> 00:52:54.694]  Well, guess what, listeners?
[00:52:54.694 --> 00:52:55.795]  You're right.
[00:52:55.795 --> 00:52:57.076]  So I'm telling President Trump this.
[00:52:58.109 --> 00:53:00.410]  The Democrats want to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.531]  There's massive pressure to do it.
[00:53:01.531 --> 00:53:04.653]  It's not going to stop criminals committing crimes.
[00:53:04.653 --> 00:53:19.442]  And if you're going to blame the 10 million plus silencer and suppressor owners in this country because some wound up guy in a gun-free zone went and attacked his co-workers and had one in his truck, then that's my line of defense.
[00:53:20.902 --> 00:53:24.284]  President Trump, if you become Hillary Clinton, what's the point of supporting you?
[00:53:24.284 --> 00:53:29.407]  You think you're going to garner support from Piers Morgan and the left by doing things like this?
[00:53:29.407 --> 00:53:32.149]  All you're going to do is turn your base against you.
[00:53:32.149 --> 00:53:36.212]  So I'm going to tell you what I told Piers Morgan on CNN.
[00:53:36.212 --> 00:53:37.772]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:53:37.772 --> 00:53:39.333]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:53:39.333 --> 00:53:40.554]  Mao took the guns.
[00:53:40.554 --> 00:53:43.056]  And if you try to take our firearms, 1776 will commence again!
[00:53:43.056 --> 00:53:43.416]  Damn it, Trump!
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:51.542]  At least you said at the end of the clip, well, you're not inclined to do it.
[00:53:51.542 --> 00:53:53.983]  Okay, but you're giving it lip service.
[00:53:53.983 --> 00:54:03.367]  Once you ban bump stocks, and that whole fake story of what happened when he knows a fraud, you open the door to blame the tools instead of the psychopaths.
[00:54:03.367 --> 00:54:07.429]  And once you did that, you joined the Deep State and the globalists, who are your mortal enemies?
[00:54:08.447 --> 00:54:13.969]  Trump, I want to support you, but dammit, you cross the line on the Second Amendment.
[00:54:13.969 --> 00:54:18.571]  I'm sworn to defend this constitutional republic against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:54:18.571 --> 00:54:22.393]  And you cross that line, you become an enemy of the republic.
[00:54:22.393 --> 00:54:26.595]  Trump, you know the right thing to do.
[00:54:26.595 --> 00:54:27.215]  You have been warned.
[00:54:29.542 --> 00:54:30.764]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:54:30.764 --> 00:54:32.105]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:54:32.105 --> 00:54:33.146]  Mao took the guns.
[00:54:33.146 --> 00:54:34.728]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:54:34.728 --> 00:54:36.050]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:41.496]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:54:41.496 --> 00:54:46.022]  Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken.
[00:54:46.022 --> 00:54:47.543]  We will not relinquish them.
[00:54:47.543 --> 00:54:48.445]  Do you understand?
[00:54:49.045 --> 00:54:58.593]  California Senator Dianne Feinstein worked for more than a year to get the Assault Weapons Bill passed in the face of ferocious opposition from the National Rifle Association.
[00:54:58.593 --> 00:55:01.015]  She says she got the best she could.
[00:55:01.015 --> 00:55:15.447]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in, I would have done it.
[00:55:15.447 --> 00:55:16.708]  I could not do that.
[00:55:17.408 --> 00:55:20.650]  The votes weren't here.
[00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:27.132]  But if Trump supports them, well then what's going to happen?
[00:55:27.132 --> 00:55:28.133]  Pretty amazing times.
[00:55:28.133 --> 00:55:33.555]  We're going to go to break and we're going to have our guest in here, one of the survivors of Benghazi.
[00:55:33.555 --> 00:55:35.696]  We've had a studio before.
[00:55:35.696 --> 00:55:36.796]  John Tiggs is going to be here with us.
[00:55:36.796 --> 00:55:37.597]  Tiggs is his nickname.
[00:55:38.559 --> 00:55:42.061]  And we're going to be talking about a whole bunch of different issues and what's unfolding in this country.
[00:55:42.061 --> 00:55:48.866]  And we have a pastor joining us from Canada who was arrested for his free speech.
[00:55:48.866 --> 00:55:51.187]  It is now happening.
[00:55:51.187 --> 00:55:58.652]  The European hate laws are here and we've got to stand up and say no.
[00:55:58.652 --> 00:56:00.333]  Please remember we are listeners supported.
[00:56:01.331 --> 00:56:03.793]  And without you, we will not be on the air.
[00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:04.934]  Period.
[00:56:04.934 --> 00:56:06.936]  We have the new Space Force shirt.
[00:56:06.936 --> 00:56:07.716]  America's back.
[00:56:07.716 --> 00:56:09.338]  People love the design.
[00:56:09.338 --> 00:56:10.319]  It's already a bestseller.
[00:56:10.319 --> 00:56:12.060]  It's 33% off.
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:25.051]  Part of the total Super Force special, and the reason it's named that is everything that has Force in the name, like Brain Force Plus, Turbo Force, it's all 50% off.
[00:56:25.051 --> 00:56:27.233]  All the supplements that have Force in the name are 50% off.
[00:56:29.169 --> 00:56:29.450]  I think?
[00:56:51.801 --> 00:56:54.443]  Slowing the shrinkage of your telomeres.
[00:56:54.443 --> 00:56:58.385]  If there's anything that Mother Nature and God gave us that's close to the fountain of youth, this is it.
[00:56:58.385 --> 00:57:01.127]  DNA Force Plus, 50% off.
[00:57:01.127 --> 00:57:03.829]  50% off Brain Force Plus, our great nootropic.
[00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:07.171]  50% off Turbo Force, it's like the 10-hour energy clean and healthy and good.
[00:57:07.171 --> 00:57:08.212]  You can read the thousands.
[00:57:09.474 --> 00:57:16.097]  A five-star reviews about all of those products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:16.097 --> 00:57:17.458]  That's the umbrella site.
[00:57:17.458 --> 00:57:23.861]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the supplement pages and right to those areas.
[00:57:23.861 --> 00:57:26.523]  But that is how we're able to fund this operation.
[00:57:26.523 --> 00:57:28.764]  Plus these are great products that you need and that are awesome.
[00:57:29.264 --> 00:57:32.485]  Separately, the film is now out and available to see online.
[00:57:32.485 --> 00:57:34.746]  YouCan'tWatchThis.com.
[00:57:34.746 --> 00:57:41.949]  With all the censors, you've got to go watch that amazing film about globalist censorship and how to fight back at YouCan'tWatchThis.com.
[00:57:41.949 --> 00:57:43.749]  So that film is now out.
[00:57:43.749 --> 00:57:46.790]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with our number two.
[00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:51.752]  InfoWars.
[00:57:51.752 --> 00:57:54.713]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:57:55.248 --> 00:57:57.190]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:59.672]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[00:57:59.672 --> 00:58:00.612]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[00:58:00.612 --> 00:58:01.073]  Yes, sir.
[00:58:01.073 --> 00:58:02.374]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:58:02.374 --> 00:58:04.475]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[00:58:04.475 --> 00:58:08.198]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case.
[00:58:08.198 --> 00:58:10.400]  My truck, sports shirts, all the equipment.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.341]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[00:58:12.341 --> 00:58:13.322]  God bless you, brother.
[00:58:13.322 --> 00:58:16.865]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now.
[00:58:16.865 --> 00:58:19.667]  I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread
[00:58:20.307 --> 00:58:21.408]  You're our only hope, brother.
[00:58:21.408 --> 00:58:23.730]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:26.472]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[00:58:50.089 --> 00:58:53.692]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:58:53.692 --> 00:58:55.473]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:58:55.473 --> 00:59:06.742]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:59:07.503 --> 00:59:16.712]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:59:16.712 --> 00:59:22.457]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:59:22.457 --> 00:59:27.763]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:59:27.763 --> 00:59:30.005]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:59:30.365 --> 00:59:32.087]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:59:32.087 --> 00:59:42.076]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:59:42.076 --> 00:59:44.738]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:59:44.738 --> 00:59:53.766]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:59:53.766 --> 00:59:56.469]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:14.902]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:00:14.902 --> 01:00:18.187]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:29.203]  If you think gun control or something like that is gonna change a terrorist's point of view, I think you're, like, out of your mind.
[01:00:29.203 --> 01:00:32.164]  You may think you've got me worried about what you're gonna do.
[01:00:32.164 --> 01:00:34.665]  Dude, you're about to find out what I'm gonna do.
[01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:36.826]  And that's gonna worry you a lot more.
[01:00:36.826 --> 01:00:37.586]  No, no.
[01:00:37.586 --> 01:00:42.048]  You don't step aside, we'll tear you apart.
[01:00:42.048 --> 01:00:44.389]  You die first, get it?
[01:00:44.389 --> 01:00:49.670]  Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe, you understand me?
[01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:50.911]  He's blood, let's rush him.
[01:00:50.911 --> 01:00:51.011]  No.
[01:00:52.495 --> 01:00:55.456]  You're not as stupid as you look, Hank.
[01:00:55.456 --> 01:00:59.777]  Yeah, I don't understand the concepts of conversation of the gun culture.
[01:00:59.777 --> 01:01:04.098]  We've lived with guns since, what, the 7th century or something?
[01:01:04.098 --> 01:01:04.578]  I don't know.
[01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:10.360]  We all know that right now, guns is a totem, it's a metaphor that disenfranchised white guys need.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.880]  It makes them feel good because they're being proud.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.281]  You can say what you want, I don't agree with that.
[01:01:13.281 --> 01:01:16.461]  There's a big difference between Fantasyland and reality.
[01:01:16.461 --> 01:01:17.922]  Fantasyland is what we do.
[01:01:17.922 --> 01:01:20.823]  Doing a movie, doing a television show, that's Fantasyland.
[01:01:20.823 --> 01:01:22.123]  And that's where that stuff belongs.
[01:01:22.503 --> 01:01:29.730]  In reality, when we're dealing with things like terrorism and whatnot, we're all going to have different opinions on how to do it, how to deal with it.
[01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:37.616]  Mine happens to be that I think there's a very strong reason the Founding Fathers had for the Second Amendment, and that is that no government ever
[01:01:38.317 --> 01:01:42.962]  Hasn't had to fight its own people and its own people hasn't had to fight its own government.
[01:01:42.962 --> 01:01:44.043]  So what are you going to do?
[01:01:44.043 --> 01:01:44.764]  Outlaw everything?
[01:01:44.764 --> 01:01:45.745]  That ain't the answer.
[01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:49.489]  Just put some control.
[01:01:49.489 --> 01:01:50.670]  Put some controls?
[01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:54.033]  What, so the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[01:01:54.033 --> 01:01:55.235]  No, not so you can't.
[01:01:55.235 --> 01:01:57.257]  Just so the idiots can't get ahold of us.
[01:01:57.257 --> 01:01:58.698]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[01:01:58.698 --> 01:02:00.120]  Are you serious about that?
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:01.981]  Are you serious?
[01:02:01.981 --> 01:02:02.242]  What?
[01:02:02.242 --> 01:02:03.163]  Good will that?
[01:02:03.163 --> 01:02:05.545]  Oh my God.
[01:02:05.545 --> 01:02:07.087]  We had our Civil War.
[01:02:07.087 --> 01:02:16.496]  If that Second Amendment hadn't been there, those people would not have had the opportunity to do what they considered was defending their life, their way, their style of living.
[01:02:16.496 --> 01:02:18.438]  So, I agree with that.
[01:02:18.438 --> 01:02:22.022]  I think that's an important part of our existence, and it's basically that simple.
[01:02:25.937 --> 01:02:30.255]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:02:32.335 --> 01:02:33.336]  And that's saying something.
[01:02:33.336 --> 01:02:35.838]  John Tiegen is in studio for the second time with us.
[01:02:35.838 --> 01:02:38.601]  Goes by TIG and JohnTiegen.com.
[01:02:38.601 --> 01:02:43.305]  John, J-O-H-N-T-I-E-G-E-N.com on Twitter.
[01:02:43.305 --> 01:02:44.266]  John Tiegen.
[01:02:44.266 --> 01:02:45.387]  Good to have you here with us, my friend.
[01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:46.088]  Hey, thanks for having me again.
[01:02:46.088 --> 01:02:47.469]  You're doing the Lord's work as usual.
[01:02:47.469 --> 01:02:49.771]  You're raising money for veterans and others.
[01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:51.232]  We'll tell folks about that in the next segment.
[01:02:51.232 --> 01:02:55.436]  You've got an amazing Tommy gun that you're going to show TV viewers and that you're going to be auctioning off.
[01:02:56.477 --> 01:02:57.417]  We were just now talking.
[01:02:57.417 --> 01:03:04.660]  What do you think about President Trump with Piers Morgan saying, yeah, we may have to try to ban suppressors?
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.281]  Again, you're taking away a tool.
[01:03:06.281 --> 01:03:09.602]  You're not going to fix the problem at all because the problem is people.
[01:03:09.602 --> 01:03:12.543]  I mean, the tool that they use to kill people is...
[01:03:14.092 --> 01:03:15.213]  It can be anything.
[01:03:15.213 --> 01:03:20.396]  You know, you start banning, let's say you ban every gun in the world, next thing you know you're going to have more Oklahoma City bombings.
[01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:23.878]  You're going to have, you know, suicide bombers more than guns.
[01:03:23.878 --> 01:03:25.359]  Yeah, the Islamists just keep using vehicles.
[01:03:25.359 --> 01:03:26.699]  We're going to ban cars?
[01:03:26.699 --> 01:03:29.641]  I mean, people, if they want it, they're going to find a way to do it.
[01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:33.223]  Just banning guns and accessories is not going to solve it.
[01:03:33.223 --> 01:03:34.504]  You know, Trump's pretty smart.
[01:03:34.504 --> 01:03:38.606]  He's got to know trying to appease the Democrats is never going to make them happy.
[01:03:38.606 --> 01:03:40.107]  So I wonder why he'd make a statement like that.
[01:03:41.149 --> 01:03:44.011]  Maybe he just wants one agreement with CNN.
[01:03:44.011 --> 01:03:45.132]  I guess, I mean, I don't know.
[01:03:45.132 --> 01:03:46.112]  I don't know why he would.
[01:03:46.112 --> 01:03:50.215]  I mean, again, a suppressor is not quiet.
[01:03:50.215 --> 01:03:53.317]  You're still going to hear a gun go off in the other room.
[01:03:53.317 --> 01:03:55.839]  It doesn't make it totally silent.
[01:03:55.839 --> 01:04:08.687]  That's the crazy part about this, is that Trump's, I think, doing a really good job on so many fronts, but then something like this with the Second Amendment, he already banned bump stocks, and then now somebody commits a crime with a
[01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:09.881]  I don't
[01:04:32.028 --> 01:04:33.048]  I'm not joking.
[01:04:33.048 --> 01:04:34.029]  That is crazy.
[01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:36.170]  I know this sounds like BS.
[01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:36.950]  Alright, John, let's go.
[01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:37.731]  No, I believe it.
[01:04:37.731 --> 01:04:39.091]  We're going to come back in one minute.
[01:04:39.091 --> 01:04:51.537]  We're going to get into this event you've got coming up, other events, and then we're going to talk about the fact that I've seen you quoted as saying only about 60% of what you see in 13 hours is actually accurate.
[01:04:51.537 --> 01:04:54.779]  So we'll talk about Benghazi, the rest of the story, that exposes Hillary Clinton.
[01:04:54.779 --> 01:04:55.279]  That's critical.
[01:04:58.599 --> 01:05:06.683]  Our powerful line of fluoride-free products is the perfect gift for yourself or others who are exploring a healthier, happier lifestyle.
[01:05:06.683 --> 01:05:12.265]  With options ranging from toothpaste to oral spray, it's easy to find the perfect option for you.
[01:05:12.265 --> 01:05:18.108]  Super Blue Toothpaste is the fan favorite fluoride-free toothpaste that every InfoWarrior loves.

[01:06:20.831 --> 01:06:25.316]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:25.316 --> 01:06:27.338]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:27.338 --> 01:06:30.160]  Alright, we've got a lot to cover while he's in studio with us.
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.842]  He's been in studio with us before.
[01:06:31.842 --> 01:06:40.611]  John Teague is his full name, one of the survivors of the Benghazi stand-down.
[01:06:40.611 --> 01:06:44.154]  And he's on about a bunch of issues today, but I said, what do you want to hit first?
[01:06:44.835 --> 01:06:54.264]  And he said, I want to get into what really happened in Benghazi and the fact that, you know, look, only about 60% of what's in that movie, 13 hours, is actually accurate.
[01:06:54.264 --> 01:07:08.316]  It's even worse than that, because Hillary's running around saying Trump's a traitor, he needs to be arrested, he's obstructed, he's done all these bad things, but she's the one from Benghazi to the servers, to all of it, and then she's still crawling around, though, acting like she's this great person.
[01:07:08.316 --> 01:07:08.997]  What's that like for you?
[01:07:09.628 --> 01:07:22.134]  Yeah, you know, it's pretty disgusting that she's even out there even speaking about stuff like this, because, you know, everybody knows she lied about her emails, she lied about what happened in Benghazi, and, you know, even to the families, right to the face of the families of the fallen.
[01:07:22.134 --> 01:07:26.796]  So, it's pretty disgusting how she's going out talking like this.
[01:07:28.072 --> 01:07:34.619]  I've got my criticisms of Trump, but my God, can you imagine what it would have been like if Hillary would have gotten in?
[01:07:34.619 --> 01:07:36.541]  A thousand times worse.
[01:07:36.541 --> 01:07:42.127]  I mean, that probably would have complete gun ban, or almost complete gun ban.
[01:07:42.127 --> 01:07:43.909]  And who knows what the chaos would be on the border.
[01:07:43.909 --> 01:07:45.070]  I mean, it'd be totally worse.
[01:07:46.667 --> 01:07:48.088]  That's a good point.
[01:07:48.088 --> 01:07:49.969]  I mean, you almost died.
[01:07:49.969 --> 01:07:51.089]  Some of your friends died.
[01:07:51.089 --> 01:07:53.730]  A lot of innocent people died because of a stand-down.
[01:07:53.730 --> 01:07:55.071]  We now know she ordered the stand-down.
[01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:57.672]  People that you work with heard the stand-down.
[01:07:57.672 --> 01:07:59.233]  You witnessed it.
[01:07:59.233 --> 01:08:03.315]  Have we ever figured out exactly why she did it and what was behind it?
[01:08:03.315 --> 01:08:08.117]  And then specifically, so it's on the record, you were there, what really did happen?
[01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:11.899]  You know, the stand-down that I know I heard was from the Chief of Base.
[01:08:11.899 --> 01:08:14.741]  But for other ones that everybody's saying, it was the one that pretty much
[01:08:16.246 --> 01:08:26.272]  The Fast Company that was getting ready to deploy to Benghazi, they got told pretty much, don't go, go, don't go, go, or change into clothes, don't, change into this, change back out.
[01:08:26.272 --> 01:08:44.101]  You know, and that just delays and delays, and you know, it's seconds that count, especially in a burning building, under live fire, it's not minutes, it's seconds, you know, and it's, it, you know, it caused the death of Rowan and Bob, their, her lack of due diligence, and
[01:08:45.424 --> 01:08:50.606]  Keeping track of the security of the consulates killed Ambassador Stephen Sean Smith because the consulate got attacked twice prior.
[01:08:50.606 --> 01:08:56.787]  I was there the second time it got attacked and there was only two security personnel that night when it got attacked the second time.
[01:08:56.787 --> 01:09:05.870]  So again, I mean, her... It's just crazy the fact that she wants to tell Trump he needs to be in jail, she should be the one in jail just for her emails.
[01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:10.652]  I mean, her private server which got compromised by foreign entities.
[01:09:10.652 --> 01:09:13.893]  I mean, that's classified TS service and
[01:09:14.853 --> 01:09:19.896]  You know, if I would have did it as a service member, as an individual, I'd be in prison immediately.
[01:09:19.896 --> 01:09:21.957]  I mean, there wouldn't be no waiting for a trial.
[01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:23.058]  You'd go straight to jail.
[01:09:23.058 --> 01:09:24.359]  And then you would wait.
[01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:28.442]  Oh, it's like these people that take signed orders off the president's desk and hide them.
[01:09:28.442 --> 01:09:30.263]  That's stealing national security items.
[01:09:30.263 --> 01:09:31.443]  That's obstruction.
[01:09:31.443 --> 01:09:33.084]  I mean, that's just, but they just do it.
[01:09:33.084 --> 01:09:33.885]  Then they brag about it.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:40.706]  Yeah, I mean, well, she's doing a, she's a keynote speaker for some cyber security company coming up.
[01:09:40.706 --> 01:09:41.947]  That's hilarious!
[01:09:41.947 --> 01:09:42.267]  Really?
[01:09:42.267 --> 01:09:46.832]  That'd be like having Jeffrey Dahmer, you know, do a talk against cannibalism.
[01:09:46.832 --> 01:09:48.894]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:09:48.894 --> 01:09:50.315]  The world is just, it's backwards.
[01:09:50.315 --> 01:09:51.276]  It's totally ass backwards.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:10:04.923]  Colonel Schaefer, who has a lot of good sources, like a week after Benghazi happened, he said they were trying to get weapons caches in these warehouses, that Hillary wanted them shipped into Syria to start that next war.
[01:10:04.923 --> 01:10:07.683]  And a lot of that later, years later, came out.
[01:10:07.683 --> 01:10:19.026]  And I talked to other sources that said that was what happened, and that Hillary actually premeditatedly just wanted to get rid of the ambassador so that there wouldn't be any witnesses to the weapons transfer.
[01:10:20.627 --> 01:10:22.028]  That's totally possible.
[01:10:22.028 --> 01:10:23.889]  I mean, because I never saw any of the weapons.
[01:10:23.889 --> 01:10:31.715]  Again, that was more State Department than the agency stuff, so... And didn't some of the other local State Department people and others get warnings to get out?
[01:10:31.715 --> 01:10:33.696]  And a bunch of them left, and then you guys were stuck there?
[01:10:34.768 --> 01:10:40.170]  When the USAID got attacked, a lot of other Americans were told to leave Benghazi.
[01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:44.632]  A lot of other Western consulates, they closed down.
[01:10:44.632 --> 01:10:49.494]  The Italians are still there and I think the French were still there, but all the rest had moved out after that.
[01:10:49.494 --> 01:10:53.275]  And what about Hillary trying to blame some trailer for a movie about Mohammed?
[01:10:53.275 --> 01:10:57.317]  I mean, from all I saw, that was just a red herring to cover up why they really attacked.
[01:10:57.617 --> 01:11:00.418]  Yeah, that only had to do with Egypt.
[01:11:00.418 --> 01:11:08.180]  I don't think a lot of people remember that the embassy in Cairo got overrun eight hours prior to Benghazi being attacked.
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:19.862]  And for them to even have military assets going towards the embassy during that time, just, again, the lack of leadership that we had that night was totally up in front.
[01:11:19.862 --> 01:11:21.583]  I mean, it was disgusting.
[01:11:22.163 --> 01:11:30.230]  Imagine if Trump ordered a stand-down for 13 hours of surrounded Americans and then got caught lying about it, what we would do to him?
[01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:34.834]  But with Hillary, she seems to just have a get-out-of-jail-free card and to never get in trouble.
[01:11:34.834 --> 01:11:42.060]  And she, to a great extent, is still running the Democrat embedded groups that are still in the government that are resisting the President.
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:44.142]  And for me, that's really the most criminal thing I've seen.
[01:11:44.142 --> 01:11:46.944]  I don't know if you've seen this in the news, but you seem to always be up on stuff.
[01:11:48.044 --> 01:11:54.227]  They are just ignoring Trump's orders on declassifying the Russiagate stuff to show the illegal spying.
[01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:57.748]  They're ignoring his orders on other things he said.
[01:11:57.748 --> 01:12:00.610]  Basically, the government just does what it wants.
[01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:03.391]  Well, the Democrat portion of it definitely does.
[01:12:03.391 --> 01:12:12.655]  What I understand is if Barr releases the information that they want, he'd be under criminal investigation for releasing because he's not allowed to release it.
[01:12:14.463 --> 01:12:20.626]  Exactly, and then the Democrats continue to leak whatever they want, but they leak selectively to paint the picture they want.
[01:12:20.626 --> 01:12:26.689]  But now the President has said, you can release whatever you want, he has the authority to do that, but that's still held up.
[01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:28.270]  But I wonder what's going to come out when that comes out.
[01:12:29.383 --> 01:12:34.807]  I don't think any, there's not going to be a smoking gun, I don't think anything big is going to happen.
[01:12:34.807 --> 01:12:44.694]  I don't, whatever, because a lot of this, I think a lot of them they can go read, or they could have read the whole entire unedacted thing if they went inside the skiff, but they refuse to go into the skiff when I know.
[01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:45.615]  Sure, absolutely.
[01:12:45.615 --> 01:12:47.737]  Well, that's why Trump's saying not just
[01:12:48.777 --> 01:12:56.481]  Not just the unredacted Mueller report, but all the illegal spying that the Clintons and Obama engaged in during the campaign and after.
[01:12:56.481 --> 01:13:05.967]  That's what I'm saying is, they've still got people inside the intelligence agencies that are operating as a mutinous, rogue, stay-behind networks that are then working against the President.
[01:13:05.967 --> 01:13:07.988]  Yeah, it's pretty deep.
[01:13:07.988 --> 01:13:14.211]  I mean, it's going to take years, if not decades, to weed these people out.
[01:13:14.211 --> 01:13:16.552]  How many years ago is Benghazi now?
[01:13:16.552 --> 01:13:17.473]  About seven years.
[01:13:18.891 --> 01:13:21.854]  Are you more angry now or less angry now?
[01:13:21.854 --> 01:13:23.196]  I'd say about the same.
[01:13:23.196 --> 01:13:24.617]  There's no more, no less.
[01:13:24.617 --> 01:13:34.548]  I mean it's pretty mind-boggling that nobody's actually been held accountable for the inactions that the government at the time had taken.
[01:13:34.548 --> 01:13:35.510]  We also forget
[01:13:36.527 --> 01:13:47.032]  And you know all the specifics, but going back in memory, you guys got threatened a lot when she was lying about you not to speak out, and basically Obama was ordering people not to speak out, but you guys did the right thing and did speak out.
[01:13:47.032 --> 01:13:49.113]  I remember you went on Megyn Kelly and things like that.
[01:13:49.113 --> 01:13:49.653]  Yeah, we did.
[01:13:49.653 --> 01:13:56.036]  We were told we had to sign a couple extra nondisclosure agreements, and we were never threatened not to speak out.
[01:13:56.036 --> 01:13:58.878]  We were just told don't go to the media and speak.
[01:13:58.878 --> 01:14:01.839]  If you wanted to speak, go in front of Congress, go in front of the committees and talk.
[01:14:02.379 --> 01:14:12.366]  But, you know, going for our job, what we were doing, going and speaking to the media, we definitely would lose our job, but then we could also be criminally charged for revealing classified information.
[01:14:12.366 --> 01:14:13.887]  But what made you guys go ahead and do it?
[01:14:13.887 --> 01:14:15.387]  Just because you knew Hillary was lying?
[01:14:15.387 --> 01:14:23.813]  That and we went and we did testify, and they still kept the same story about how it happened and what happened and why it happened, and we just said, nope, that's it, we're done.
[01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:26.595]  So you went through the channels like you were supposed to.
[01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:26.936]  Yep.
[01:14:26.936 --> 01:14:27.616]  And then they didn't do anything.
[01:14:27.616 --> 01:14:30.038]  And that's why under law whistleblowing is protected.
[01:14:30.038 --> 01:14:32.560]  You've gone through channels and then they don't do anything.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:32.741]  Yep.
[01:14:32.741 --> 01:14:35.683]  And that's why we, we wouldn't, everybody says, well, why'd you do a book?
[01:14:35.683 --> 01:14:36.864]  Why'd you just come talk to the media?
[01:14:36.864 --> 01:14:44.151]  Well, the problem is you go on, say you go on Fox News, they'll spin it, what you say, they'll spin it to where, how they want it to sound.
[01:14:44.151 --> 01:14:46.753]  But if you put it in a book, it's written down, you cannot change the source.
[01:14:46.753 --> 01:14:47.654]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:14:47.654 --> 01:14:48.815]  There's this idea that
[01:14:49.215 --> 01:14:51.656]  You know, you've been in the military a long time, dangerous parts of the world.
[01:14:51.656 --> 01:14:53.377]  People want to read what you had to say.
[01:14:53.377 --> 01:14:54.637]  This is all public what went on.
[01:14:54.637 --> 01:14:56.038]  They're putting their lives out about it.
[01:14:56.038 --> 01:15:04.802]  And then it's bad when you lose all your contracting jobs that you then try to write a book to get your name back, to tell the truth, and to fund yourself.
[01:15:04.802 --> 01:15:06.763]  American patriots should be proud.
[01:15:06.763 --> 01:15:08.704]  People should buy the books you've been involved in.
[01:15:08.704 --> 01:15:09.984]  They should see the films.
[01:15:09.984 --> 01:15:14.106]  They should support you because people pay a price for telling the truth.
[01:15:14.106 --> 01:15:18.628]  And if we as Americans don't economically support people that are patriots, well then
[01:15:19.108 --> 01:15:20.369]  We get what we deserve.
[01:15:20.369 --> 01:15:24.773]  Yeah, I mean, we totally lost our source of income and, you know, pretty much our way of life.
[01:15:24.773 --> 01:15:29.157]  It went from a private life to a public life and just like that.
[01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:30.138]  And you didn't start it.
[01:15:30.138 --> 01:15:31.379]  Hillary ordered the stand down.
[01:15:31.379 --> 01:15:32.080]  The people died.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.621]  Then she lied about it.
[01:15:33.621 --> 01:15:34.782]  You were put in that position.
[01:15:34.782 --> 01:15:35.603]  You did the right thing.
[01:15:35.603 --> 01:15:36.564]  So you're a hero.
[01:15:36.564 --> 01:15:38.986]  Not just what you did on the ground, but the moral courage.
[01:15:38.986 --> 01:15:42.849]  And I want to point that out to people, what we've gone through, what you go through to tell the truth.
[01:15:43.670 --> 01:15:46.635]  They want to shut us up because we're telling the truth and we're not going to do it.
[01:15:46.635 --> 01:15:48.558]  So I want to thank the audience for all of your support.
[01:15:48.558 --> 01:15:51.463]  You're the reason we're still on the air in defiance of their fraud.
[01:15:51.463 --> 01:15:55.569]  You're doing some other exciting stuff we'll talk about when we come back with one of the great heroes of Benghazi.
[01:15:57.524 --> 01:15:58.764]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.764 --> 01:16:00.065]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.065 --> 01:16:03.805]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.805 --> 01:16:04.886]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.886 --> 01:16:06.706]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.706 --> 01:16:08.426]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:27.048 --> 01:16:33.390]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:36.430]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:42.352]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.352 --> 01:16:46.153]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.153 --> 01:16:47.413]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.413 --> 01:16:48.753]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.753 --> 01:16:54.955]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:54.955 --> 01:16:56.375]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.313 --> 01:16:59.274]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:59.274 --> 01:17:04.597]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:04.597 --> 01:17:06.177]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.177 --> 01:17:14.541]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:20.224]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:17:20.384 --> 01:17:22.205]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:24.386]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:24.386 --> 01:17:28.887]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:28.887 --> 01:17:31.068]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:17:31.068 --> 01:17:38.931]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:17:38.971 --> 01:17:40.332]  Okay, it's true.
[01:17:40.332 --> 01:17:42.774]  I stayed up late last night, so I had to have it.
[01:18:56.863 --> 01:18:58.063]  And get the fish oil!
[01:18:58.063 --> 01:19:03.265]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:19:03.265 --> 01:19:11.827]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:19:11.827 --> 01:19:14.808]  Some of the most polluted areas on Earth are major cities.
[01:19:14.808 --> 01:19:16.548]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:19:16.548 --> 01:19:22.830]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:30.252]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[01:19:30.252 --> 01:19:33.193]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:19:33.193 --> 01:19:37.135]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:19:37.135 --> 01:19:41.116]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:19:41.116 --> 01:19:42.937]  I've got two in my home.
[01:19:42.937 --> 01:19:49.019]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:19:49.019 --> 01:19:49.860]  Don't live
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:54.403]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[01:19:54.403 --> 01:20:01.327]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:20:01.327 --> 01:20:03.969]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:30.248 --> 01:20:31.689]  John Teigen is my guest.
[01:20:31.689 --> 01:20:33.389]  He goes by Tig.
[01:20:33.389 --> 01:20:35.810]  And of course, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:35.810 --> 01:20:37.271]  He was correcting me during the break.
[01:20:37.271 --> 01:20:41.252]  He said he's made no money off the big Benghazi book.
[01:20:41.252 --> 01:20:42.833]  And that's the crazy thing.
[01:20:42.833 --> 01:20:43.933]  Tell us about that.
[01:20:43.933 --> 01:20:48.395]  No, I guess they said that we have to sell like over three million books before we make anything.
[01:20:48.395 --> 01:20:52.316]  And even then, I think we make like three cents a book or something like that.
[01:20:52.316 --> 01:20:53.277]  Who signed that deal?
[01:20:53.877 --> 01:20:58.519]  Well, there's five of us involved, and plus we added Roan's kid in there too, so... That's good.
[01:20:58.519 --> 01:21:00.559]  Yeah, so it split up.
[01:21:00.559 --> 01:21:01.840]  That's pretty much the reason why.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:02.500]  I understand.
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:05.041]  But again, we didn't do it for the money, we did it to get the story out.
[01:21:05.041 --> 01:21:06.962]  That's fine.
[01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:13.344]  But I still think it's okay for patriots, when they sacrifice a lot, and didn't ask to be in the story, to be able to make money off of it.
[01:21:13.344 --> 01:21:14.044]  Yeah, you should be able to.
[01:21:14.044 --> 01:21:22.387]  Because the left always is telling us we can't have our own operations, we can't speak, but then all they do is take our money from us, and taxpayer money, and then use it against us.
[01:21:22.967 --> 01:21:24.448]  Yeah, pretty much.
[01:21:24.448 --> 01:21:25.769]  I mean, they do it.
[01:21:25.769 --> 01:21:29.351]  They'll sell themselves out and make money off of it, but we can't.
[01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:31.932]  All you guys need to sell published books.
[01:21:31.932 --> 01:21:32.372]  Yeah.
[01:21:32.372 --> 01:21:35.794]  I'm telling you, you won't sell three million copies, but you'll get the word out and you'll support yourself.
[01:21:35.794 --> 01:21:40.717]  Because I know you travel the country and speak, so let's talk about that and this awesome firearm you've got over here.
[01:21:40.717 --> 01:21:43.798]  Radio listeners should go to your website, or where can they go and look at it?
[01:21:43.798 --> 01:21:44.979]  Well, it's not on the website.
[01:21:44.979 --> 01:21:46.860]  It's a one-of-a-kind Tommy gun.
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:49.862]  I got it from... I just want to see photos of it.
[01:21:51.311 --> 01:21:54.436]  TV viewers can obviously see this, and I like how it's in a guitar case.
[01:21:54.436 --> 01:21:55.297]  Oh yeah, you gotta have it.
[01:21:55.297 --> 01:21:56.179]  It's a Tommy gun.
[01:21:56.179 --> 01:21:57.701]  It's gotta be in a guitar case.
[01:21:57.701 --> 01:22:01.828]  So it's a one-of-a-kind from Car Firearms, the Tommy gun.
[01:22:04.219 --> 01:22:04.899]  It's a tribute.
[01:22:04.899 --> 01:22:06.980]  Sorry, I didn't mean to flag you there.
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:10.701]  It's a tribute to Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith.
[01:22:10.701 --> 01:22:14.123]  I got a TIG series.
[01:22:14.123 --> 01:22:18.924]  There's a card they did a TIG series Tommy Gunn did about a thousand of them.
[01:22:18.924 --> 01:22:26.647]  I got number 911, obviously for 9-11, and the paid tribute to Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith and that's what it's for.
[01:22:26.647 --> 01:22:29.448]  It's a one-of-a-kind and hopefully they auction it off on June 22nd.
[01:22:30.882 --> 01:22:34.684]  You know, I haven't shot a Tommy Gun in a long time, but they are so smooth shooting and fun.
[01:22:34.684 --> 01:22:35.064]  Oh, they are.
[01:22:35.064 --> 01:22:35.784]  They're a lot of fun.
[01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.765]  Have you tried one-handed yet?
[01:22:37.765 --> 01:22:38.206]  No.
[01:22:38.206 --> 01:22:38.546]  You can.
[01:22:38.546 --> 01:22:39.006]  You can hold them.
[01:22:39.006 --> 01:22:39.666]  It's so heavy.
[01:22:39.666 --> 01:22:41.647]  It takes a recoil.
[01:22:41.647 --> 01:22:42.928]  It's pretty cool.
[01:22:42.928 --> 01:22:46.550]  But it's, yeah, again, it's just a tribute rifle to honor the guy that shot it.
[01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:47.390]  Shoots those .45s, huh?
[01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:48.551]  Yep, that's a .45.
[01:22:48.551 --> 01:22:50.451]  How far is it accurate out to?
[01:22:50.451 --> 01:22:52.332]  That I don't know, honestly.
[01:22:52.332 --> 01:22:53.973]  It's, you know, it's a handgun.
[01:22:53.973 --> 01:22:57.575]  Pretty much is a handgun bullet, but it's going to probably shoot a hundred yards plus.
[01:22:59.946 --> 01:23:02.847]  You know, some police departments in like Asia and stuff use these.
[01:23:02.847 --> 01:23:04.548]  It's weird.
[01:23:04.548 --> 01:23:06.149]  Well, it's got the drum.
[01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:11.032]  It's got a 50-round drum that'll come with it and two 20-round magazines.
[01:23:11.032 --> 01:23:12.672]  I need to enter this.
[01:23:12.672 --> 01:23:13.913]  There's a raffle coming up or something?
[01:23:13.913 --> 01:23:15.354]  No, it'll be a live auction.
[01:23:15.354 --> 01:23:16.754]  Live auction!
[01:23:16.754 --> 01:23:20.336]  Okay, and then tell folks what the event is and how folks can be part of it.
[01:23:22.315 --> 01:23:30.399]  We call it the Warrior Weekend, but it's going to be Saturday, June 22nd at Reveley Peak Ranch in Burnett, Texas.
[01:23:30.399 --> 01:23:36.402]  We'll be able to shoot some full-auto guns during the day.
[01:23:36.402 --> 01:23:39.563]  The seats for the gala, I think they're $125 a seat.
[01:23:39.563 --> 01:23:43.285]  Again, it's a fundraiser to help veterans and first responders.
[01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:50.048]  We've got this Tommy gun, we've got a couple other custom M1s and pistols that are going to be out there auctioned off as well.
[01:23:50.048 --> 01:23:51.109]  And what's the best website?
[01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:54.393]  We can do it over the head shot of this.
[01:23:54.393 --> 01:23:55.174]  It'd be great.
[01:23:55.174 --> 01:23:56.996]  It's the TaigenFoundation.org.
[01:23:56.996 --> 01:23:58.238]  The TaigenFoundation.org.
[01:23:58.238 --> 01:23:58.759]  Yep.
[01:23:58.759 --> 01:24:01.663]  And of course, I love that even though I've known you a few years, I always butcher your name.
[01:24:01.663 --> 01:24:02.364]  I apologize.
[01:24:02.364 --> 01:24:02.925]  I'm used to it.
[01:24:02.925 --> 01:24:04.086]  The TaigenFoundation.org.
[01:24:05.259 --> 01:24:06.199]  I was saying it that way earlier.
[01:24:06.199 --> 01:24:07.260]  They were telling me different.
[01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:10.661]  I get to blend the producers in there.
[01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:12.142]  Tell us about the foundation.
[01:24:12.142 --> 01:24:16.284]  You're doing this for... Yeah, we're first responders and veterans.
[01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:18.445]  They get service dogs as their main goal.
[01:24:18.445 --> 01:24:23.507]  But then also, we help them out with their homes, with any financial bills that they need.
[01:24:23.507 --> 01:24:27.669]  We send them for treatment for PTS, TBI treatments.
[01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:29.210]  We just do whatever we can when we can do it.
[01:24:29.730 --> 01:24:34.614]  Well, this is going to be a great event, and everybody needs to go get signed up for it before it overflows.
[01:24:34.614 --> 01:24:37.697]  And again, tell folks the best website to visit?
[01:24:37.697 --> 01:24:39.338]  TheTigenFoundation.org.
[01:24:39.338 --> 01:24:42.521]  That's T-I-E-G-E-N.
[01:24:42.521 --> 01:24:45.003]  TheTigenFoundation.org.
[01:24:45.003 --> 01:24:48.826]  And I'm going to email out this video today after we're live at
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:54.663]  We can't tweet this, only our listeners can tweet.
[01:24:54.663 --> 01:24:59.869]  We've been banned everywhere because we have evil guests like Mr. Keegan on the show.
[01:24:59.869 --> 01:25:04.474]  And getting back to that, because you're going to ride shotgun with us with this pastor that's been censored.
[01:25:04.474 --> 01:25:09.459]  What do you make of the invasion at the border, the attacks on free speech, all the things that are happening?
[01:25:09.459 --> 01:25:11.722]  I never thought the left would go this criminal this fast.
[01:25:12.082 --> 01:25:15.703]  You know, it's funny, the left, they want to say Trump's trying to ban immigration.
[01:25:15.703 --> 01:25:18.944]  He's not trying to ban immigration, he's trying to stop illegal immigration.
[01:25:18.944 --> 01:25:22.685]  Trying to stop the illegals coming, and so we don't know who's coming across.
[01:25:22.685 --> 01:25:27.006]  Right now, this is what, you've got thousands, hundreds of thousands a month, isn't it now?
[01:25:27.006 --> 01:25:27.186]  Yes.
[01:25:27.186 --> 01:25:29.126]  Getting captured, getting caught.
[01:25:29.126 --> 01:25:29.866]  Those people just flow.
[01:25:29.866 --> 01:25:31.087]  Overwhelming everywhere!
[01:25:31.087 --> 01:25:32.767]  Yeah, you don't... I mean, what government can handle?
[01:25:32.767 --> 01:25:34.447]  Nothing's like this ever happened in history.
[01:25:34.447 --> 01:25:36.748]  Even in Europe, the numbers weren't this high with the Islamists.
[01:25:37.233 --> 01:25:38.474]  Yeah, I mean, you need control.
[01:25:38.474 --> 01:25:43.516]  You need to control your population and the illegal population at the border.
[01:25:43.516 --> 01:25:44.296]  That's what borders are for.
[01:25:44.296 --> 01:25:46.897]  But, I mean, Pelosi says, oh, this will kill our country.
[01:25:46.897 --> 01:25:48.078]  We've never done this before.
[01:25:48.078 --> 01:25:50.058]  Yes, we've never had open borders like this before.
[01:25:50.058 --> 01:25:52.359]  Yeah, we've never had this many people trying to cross before.
[01:25:52.359 --> 01:25:53.640]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.221]  What do you think President Trump should do?
[01:25:55.221 --> 01:26:02.344]  He's talking about declaring this emergency act a real emergency and put the regular military down there.
[01:26:02.344 --> 01:26:05.585]  Because if we just keep letting them use our system, it's already overwhelmed things.
[01:26:06.539 --> 01:26:14.524]  I mean, well, look at the two military guys who got apprehended by the Mexicans on the American side.
[01:26:14.524 --> 01:26:15.084]  Oh, that's right!
[01:26:15.084 --> 01:26:17.186]  We've now got Mexican troops disarming U.S.
[01:26:17.186 --> 01:26:17.846]  military.
[01:26:17.846 --> 01:26:19.727]  I mean, come on.
[01:26:19.727 --> 01:26:21.328]  Why not put the military on the border?
[01:26:21.328 --> 01:26:25.571]  I mean, you have border patrol agents who get firefights with the Mexican cartels down there.
[01:26:25.731 --> 01:26:27.372]  By the way, that's in the Constitution.
[01:26:27.372 --> 01:26:29.194]  Because I'm all for posse comitatus.
[01:26:29.194 --> 01:26:31.896]  I don't want troops doing police work on the streets.
[01:26:31.896 --> 01:26:36.219]  But it's in the Constitution that the military, that's where it's supposed to be, is on the border, right?
[01:26:36.219 --> 01:26:37.060]  That's what they're for.
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:40.442]  They're to protect our country from outside invasions.
[01:26:40.442 --> 01:26:41.183]  And that's what it is.
[01:26:41.183 --> 01:26:42.704]  It's a complete invasion.
[01:26:42.704 --> 01:26:46.447]  Why do you think the Democrats tried for a couple years to deny all this was happening?
[01:26:46.447 --> 01:26:54.473]  And say, oh, you know, Trump's... And now they admit it's happening, but they say the answer is just legalize everybody, which then will bring even more.
[01:26:55.714 --> 01:26:57.055]  They need the votes.
[01:26:57.055 --> 01:26:59.657]  Can I see that Tommy gun one more time?
[01:26:59.657 --> 01:27:03.440]  You know, I'm going to either send a crew to this or I'm going to come because this is only in a few weeks.
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.302]  June 22nd.
[01:27:05.302 --> 01:27:07.324]  Tell me about this ranch and the events coming up.
[01:27:07.324 --> 01:27:08.585]  It's a Reveley Peak Ranch.
[01:27:08.585 --> 01:27:10.206]  It's about 1800 acres.
[01:27:10.206 --> 01:27:13.749]  It's about an hour, hour and 20 minutes north of here.
[01:27:13.749 --> 01:27:17.172]  And you know, it's just, it's got a bunch of shooting range out there.
[01:27:17.172 --> 01:27:20.875]  It's got a repelling tower, zip lines, got a lake, it's got a bunch of trails.
[01:27:21.195 --> 01:27:27.357]  What if I show up and showboat and get this as the highest bidder, huh?
[01:27:27.357 --> 01:27:28.097]  That'd be awesome.
[01:27:28.097 --> 01:27:29.798]  I don't want to do that, but it is cool.
[01:27:29.798 --> 01:27:30.578]  I do need a Tommy Gun.
[01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:31.959]  You know, I don't have one.
[01:27:31.959 --> 01:27:32.799]  That's a perfect one.
[01:27:32.799 --> 01:27:34.680]  It's one of a kind.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.860]  It's nice.
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:38.221]  And again, what company made it?
[01:27:38.221 --> 01:27:39.281]  Carr Firearms.
[01:27:39.281 --> 01:27:44.323]  They own Magnum Research and Tommy Gun and Auto Ordinance.
[01:27:44.323 --> 01:27:50.505]  So, yeah, they did a whole series of these and 9s and a .50 Cal Desert Eagle.
[01:27:51.508 --> 01:27:53.109]  They have a .50 Cal one of these?
[01:27:53.109 --> 01:27:55.832]  No, not one of these, but a .50 Cal Desert Eagle.
[01:27:55.832 --> 01:27:56.532]  Oh, wow.
[01:27:56.532 --> 01:27:59.855]  I'll say, wow, a Tommy Gun shooting .50 Cal, that'd be awesome.
[01:27:59.855 --> 01:28:02.337]  But that Desert Eagle .50 Cal's different.
[01:28:02.337 --> 01:28:02.938]  It's shorter, right?
[01:28:02.938 --> 01:28:04.499]  Yeah, it's a handgun.
[01:28:04.499 --> 01:28:07.422]  And it's got one heck of a kick.
[01:28:07.422 --> 01:28:07.782]  I bet.
[01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:13.507]  You know, I've got one of those Spencer & Wesson .500s, and I shot a Buffalo with it.
[01:28:13.507 --> 01:28:14.148]  But I shot
[01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:20.557]  At his, like, 30 yards away, I shot at his shoulder, his heart, and actually hit him in my ass.
[01:28:20.557 --> 01:28:22.918]  So I'm not a very good shot with one of those.
[01:28:22.918 --> 01:28:23.978]  But hey, you dropped him.
[01:28:23.978 --> 01:28:31.620]  Can you, well, I took the whole cylinder, but can you be a good shot with one of those, like, the ones with 500s?
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.681]  I mean, is there a way to do it?
[01:28:33.681 --> 01:28:37.622]  Because I'm usually a pretty good shot with a revolver, and I can't hit the side of a barn door with one.
[01:28:37.622 --> 01:28:41.883]  Yeah, there's people, I can't, I'm not a very good revolver either, but there's people who can shoot those things pretty good.
[01:28:42.904 --> 01:28:43.925]  Alright, well look out.
[01:28:43.925 --> 01:28:47.851]  I may at least send a representative out there and get that Tommy gun for myself.
[01:28:47.851 --> 01:28:50.635]  Whatever you do, folks, go sign up for it and be there.
[01:28:50.635 --> 01:28:51.977]  It's for a good cause.
[01:28:51.977 --> 01:28:52.557]  We'll be back.
[01:28:52.557 --> 01:28:55.442]  Look at the attack on the First Amendment on this Friday, Global Edition.
[01:28:57.325 --> 01:28:57.785]  Ugh!
[01:28:57.785 --> 01:28:58.846]  These pains!
[01:28:58.846 --> 01:28:59.586]  My neck!
[01:28:59.586 --> 01:29:00.526]  My back!
[01:29:00.526 --> 01:29:01.367]  Shoulders!
[01:29:01.367 --> 01:29:03.187]  I've got to get some relief!
[01:29:03.187 --> 01:29:08.890]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries, or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[01:29:08.890 --> 01:29:10.770]  But you don't want to take another pill!
[01:29:10.770 --> 01:29:12.551]  There's an easier, healthier way, right?

[01:29:58.621 --> 01:30:09.689]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[01:30:09.689 --> 01:30:18.555]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[01:30:18.555 --> 01:30:22.558]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[01:30:23.238 --> 01:30:29.706]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[01:30:29.706 --> 01:30:31.888]  And you may be experiencing back up too.
[01:30:31.888 --> 01:30:37.815]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to Infowarsstore.com and get Oxy Powder.
[01:30:37.815 --> 01:30:40.378]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.

[01:31:12.859 --> 01:31:17.639]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[01:31:58.244 --> 01:32:00.126]  They've not shut down our speech!
[01:32:00.126 --> 01:32:05.632]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[01:32:05.632 --> 01:32:13.121]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[01:32:13.121 --> 01:32:14.442]  Are you coming back?
[01:32:14.442 --> 01:32:15.603]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:16.204 --> 01:32:17.565]  We're at Newshorse.com.
[01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:19.806]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.news.
[01:32:19.806 --> 01:32:21.807]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[01:32:21.807 --> 01:32:26.570]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:28.811]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:32:28.811 --> 01:32:32.093]  InfoWars.com, man!
[01:32:32.093 --> 01:32:32.453]  Woo!
[01:32:35.166 --> 01:32:37.948]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[01:32:37.948 --> 01:32:39.769]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[01:32:39.769 --> 01:32:42.751]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:32:42.751 --> 01:32:44.712]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[01:32:44.712 --> 01:32:48.214]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[01:32:48.214 --> 01:32:50.936]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[01:32:50.936 --> 01:32:53.377]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:32:53.377 --> 01:32:54.078]  That's where they find it.
[01:32:54.078 --> 01:32:56.219]  You know, there's things called websites.
[01:32:56.219 --> 01:33:01.222]  Just go there.
[01:33:01.222 --> 01:33:03.844]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.498 --> 01:33:19.639]  Big Brother.
[01:33:19.639 --> 01:33:21.440]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:23.341]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:23.341 --> 01:33:25.043]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:25.043 --> 01:33:26.804]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:26.804 --> 01:33:29.125]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:33:29.125 --> 01:33:31.527]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:31.527 --> 01:33:34.349]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.349 --> 01:33:34.609]  John!
[01:33:36.827 --> 01:33:42.932]  Teagan is in studios with the Heroes of Benghazi.
[01:33:42.932 --> 01:33:46.636]  Once we start debating the name back and forth, then you can't like differentiate.
[01:33:46.636 --> 01:33:47.356]  It's an awesome name.
[01:33:47.356 --> 01:33:48.237]  We're the Heroes of Benghazi.
[01:33:48.237 --> 01:33:50.279]  He's riding shotgun with us.
[01:33:50.279 --> 01:33:53.182]  And John, T-I-E-G-E-N dot com.
[01:33:53.182 --> 01:33:55.504]  Got a big event coming up here in about a week and a half or so.
[01:33:55.504 --> 01:33:57.565]  You'll want to find out about that on the website.
[01:33:58.513 --> 01:34:01.635]  But we have a guest here while we're focusing on free speech.
[01:34:01.635 --> 01:34:07.458]  Not the First Amendment, but in Canada, we have David J. Lynn, who's on the road, popping in.
[01:34:07.458 --> 01:34:09.299]  I'm going to play a few minutes of this first.
[01:34:09.299 --> 01:34:18.345]  There's an InfoWars.com article from two days ago about a street pastor attacked and arrested for preaching the gospel.
[01:34:18.345 --> 01:34:19.005]  That's right, folks.
[01:34:19.005 --> 01:34:25.789]  You don't just get banned on YouTube if a homosexual group calls itself queer and you quote the name of the group.
[01:34:27.168 --> 01:34:31.250]  No, ladies and gentlemen, if you're a preacher reading out of the Bible, you get arrested in Canada.
[01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:36.293]  In Sweden, if you criticize radical Islam or report criminal numbers, you get arrested.
[01:34:36.293 --> 01:34:46.018]  The left is coming after everybody's free speech, and even though we have governments in the United States that supposedly defend it, big tech and the universities are working against it.
[01:34:46.018 --> 01:34:49.400]  So there's a six-minute video up on InfoWars.com and Kellum Green's article.
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:52.401]  If you want to see it, it's very important.
[01:34:52.401 --> 01:34:54.943]  But we're going to play just a short excerpt of it here.
[01:34:54.943 --> 01:34:55.223]  Here it is.
[01:34:57.398 --> 01:34:59.760]  Everybody can have dignity and respect.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.681]  Everybody.
[01:35:00.681 --> 01:35:04.424]  But you know, it's not all the time that this is carried out.
[01:35:04.424 --> 01:35:09.668]  Sometimes hatred is carried out by people of various members of the community.
[01:35:09.668 --> 01:35:11.910]  We're here to tell you that we hate nobody.
[01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:15.393]  So I'm coming out of a closet and saying I'm a Christian.
[01:35:15.393 --> 01:35:19.297]  And I want to know whether you would tolerate me as a Christian.
[01:35:19.297 --> 01:35:21.318]  Would you tolerate me, sir?
[01:35:21.318 --> 01:35:22.940]  Would you tolerate me as a Christian?
[01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:25.846]  I don't want to engage.
[01:35:25.846 --> 01:35:28.509]  Ma'am, would you tolerate me as a Christian?
[01:35:28.509 --> 01:35:30.591]  Would you tolerate me as a Christian?
[01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:32.073]  Go away.
[01:35:32.073 --> 01:35:34.815]  Okay, so you're a bigot.
[01:35:34.815 --> 01:35:37.458]  Would you tolerate me as a Christian?
[01:35:37.458 --> 01:35:39.140]  You don't want to talk to me.
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:42.843]  Would you tolerate me as a Christian?
[01:35:42.843 --> 01:35:44.305]  Would you tolerate me as a Christian?
[01:35:45.482 --> 01:35:48.564]  So you don't want to talk to me?
[01:35:48.564 --> 01:35:50.185]  You don't want to talk to me?
[01:35:50.185 --> 01:35:52.126]  You're telling me to get out?
[01:35:52.126 --> 01:35:52.986]  You don't want to talk to me?
[01:35:52.986 --> 01:35:54.847]  You have your bat's face towards me?
[01:35:54.847 --> 01:35:55.707]  Acceptance.
[01:35:55.707 --> 01:35:56.808]  What about acceptance?
[01:35:56.808 --> 01:35:57.989]  I accept you.
[01:35:57.989 --> 01:35:58.449]  You're here.
[01:35:58.449 --> 01:35:59.790]  You want to shake my hand?
[01:35:59.790 --> 01:36:00.890]  What did I say?
[01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:03.031]  But why do you need a microphone?
[01:36:03.031 --> 01:36:05.673]  So that people can hear the good news of Jesus Christ.
[01:36:06.833 --> 01:36:10.815]  Okay, so I'm just going to continue on with what I have to say.
[01:36:10.815 --> 01:36:13.877]  We have people that can't even say that they love me.
[01:36:13.877 --> 01:36:15.818]  They can't even say that they tolerate me.
[01:36:15.818 --> 01:36:16.958]  They can't even say anything.
[01:36:16.958 --> 01:36:18.079]  Except Ron loves you.
[01:36:18.079 --> 01:36:19.500]  You don't accept me?
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.581]  Why would I have to get out of Toronto?
[01:36:21.581 --> 01:36:22.802]  This is a public sidewalk, I believe.
[01:36:22.802 --> 01:36:24.502]  And that's what we teach as Christians, that everybody is accepted.
[01:36:35.208 --> 01:36:37.869]  Jesus died for the sinner.
[01:36:37.869 --> 01:36:40.769]  Do you know that every person is a sinner?
[01:36:40.769 --> 01:36:42.050]  Don't touch me, please.
[01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:44.270]  Please take that off my body.
[01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:46.151]  Every heterosexual has sinned.
[01:36:46.151 --> 01:36:48.831]  Every homosexual has sinned.
[01:36:48.831 --> 01:36:54.793]  And sin is when we violate the laws of God and we go contrary to the things of faith.
[01:36:54.793 --> 01:36:56.053]  That's what sin is.
[01:36:56.053 --> 01:37:00.674]  Alright, we're gonna get to our guest now and then come back next segment to show the arrest.
[01:37:00.674 --> 01:37:02.475]  But I gotta say, I believe everybody's free speech.
[01:37:03.885 --> 01:37:10.130]  But I've walked out of a restaurant before that's not even in a party area and had some guy go, you're going to hell with bad breath in my face.
[01:37:10.130 --> 01:37:12.472]  I'm like, OK, dude, you're going to turn people off.
[01:37:12.472 --> 01:37:13.973]  And I'm not saying I'm against those street preachers.
[01:37:13.973 --> 01:37:16.715]  I'm saying this guy's very well spoken, very nice.
[01:37:16.715 --> 01:37:17.516]  I've watched the whole video.
[01:37:17.516 --> 01:37:18.677]  We're going to get to it.
[01:37:18.677 --> 01:37:22.360]  And he gets arrested for what he's saying.
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:23.261]  John, this is pretty scary.
[01:37:24.958 --> 01:37:26.539]  Yeah, it is.
[01:37:26.539 --> 01:37:29.301]  I wouldn't be surprised if you see that here in America soon.
[01:37:29.301 --> 01:37:33.343]  I mean, it seems to flow from over there to over here all the time.
[01:37:33.343 --> 01:37:40.867]  And again, what you saw, I mean, he wasn't preaching any hate, no nothing, and he was saying, I accept you, but they're yelling at him.
[01:37:40.867 --> 01:37:42.108]  It's crazy.
[01:37:42.108 --> 01:37:49.072]  He's just simply telling him, though, that this is a very destructive lifestyle, which is his right to say, but if it isn't true, which it is.
[01:37:49.072 --> 01:37:51.233]  Let's go to David J. Lynn.
[01:37:53.146 --> 01:37:58.311]  And the best website for people to go to, I guess, would be ChristForgiveness.com.
[01:37:58.311 --> 01:37:59.392]  You've been arrested.
[01:37:59.392 --> 01:38:00.153]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:38:00.153 --> 01:38:03.537]  I know you're in your car, but we've got a good Skype connection now.
[01:38:03.537 --> 01:38:05.939]  Just for people that just tuned in, I don't think they understand.
[01:38:05.939 --> 01:38:07.881]  This is commonplace now in Canada.
[01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:14.188]  I hear about churches where the preachers are arrested because they read out of Leviticus and say that homosexual sex is a sin.
[01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:16.410]  I mean, this is widespread, isn't it?
[01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:21.393]  Yes, in fact many street preachers feel threatened.
[01:38:21.393 --> 01:38:31.981]  Many people that are just simply Christian are getting fired on the job or dismissed without pay for putting simple things like crosses on their desk or Bibles on their desk.
[01:38:31.981 --> 01:38:34.083]  I myself was a victim of that many years ago.
[01:38:34.083 --> 01:38:44.712]  I worked for the largest media company in Canada and just by putting a Bible on my desk and having some good scriptures like love everybody on my cubicle
[01:38:45.538 --> 01:38:53.961]  I was not only told to take it down, but I was brought to human resources and my job was threatened if I didn't comply.
[01:38:53.961 --> 01:38:56.602]  And this is mainstream in Canada.
[01:38:56.602 --> 01:39:03.145]  It seems as though the laws are being set up in such a way that you can say anything except
[01:39:03.973 --> 01:39:07.195]  The Gospel, except things of the Bible.
[01:39:07.195 --> 01:39:10.957]  And I'm not even talking about the controversial scriptures.
[01:39:10.957 --> 01:39:14.498]  I'm talking about simply saying Jesus died on a cross.
[01:39:14.498 --> 01:39:18.360]  Simply saying, for God so loved the world that he gave his one and only begotten son.
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:23.603]  Because when I got arrested two or three days ago now, about two days ago,
[01:39:24.508 --> 01:39:27.549]  I didn't say anything specific to their community.
[01:39:27.549 --> 01:39:32.191]  All I said was God loves you, God cares for you, He's calling you to Himself.
[01:39:32.191 --> 01:39:33.851]  I never said any trigger words.
[01:39:33.851 --> 01:39:36.012]  I never quoted any specific scripture.
[01:39:36.012 --> 01:39:40.274]  I want to be clear about this though, because we've got
[01:39:41.432 --> 01:39:48.418]  Steven Crowder about to be banned off YouTube for a joke shirt with Che Guevara saying socialism is for figs.
[01:39:48.418 --> 01:39:51.000]  Well, I think he has the right to say for facts.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.541]  And if I hate people, I'm allowed to hate them.
[01:39:52.541 --> 01:39:55.604]  I don't hate them, but damn it, they're allowed to use whatever words they want.
[01:39:55.604 --> 01:40:05.032]  So as soon as you give in to saying, I didn't even say any of the words you say don't use, well, there's always more words, and then it's a slippery slope, and pretty soon you're out there.
[01:40:06.152 --> 01:40:07.953]  Jesus loves you and you're arrested.
[01:40:07.953 --> 01:40:13.596]  And now you'll be arrested for just being a Christian and now you'll be in an underground secret church like China.
[01:40:13.596 --> 01:40:14.757]  That's where I think this is going.
[01:40:16.431 --> 01:40:17.852]  I 100% agree.
[01:40:17.852 --> 01:40:19.173]  And it's a shame.
[01:40:19.173 --> 01:40:21.814]  I shouldn't have to be ashamed to read the Bible.
[01:40:21.814 --> 01:40:25.316]  As far as I know, the Bible is not a banned book in Canada.
[01:40:25.316 --> 01:40:27.517]  There's churches on almost every block.
[01:40:27.517 --> 01:40:38.002]  And so what's happening in Canada should be a wake-up call to everyone in the United States and all throughout the world because this is spreading like wildfire.
[01:40:38.002 --> 01:40:44.826]  Our Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, is now speaking with social media giants like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram.
[01:40:45.487 --> 01:40:56.551]  And setting rules that if they don't comply with his idea of freedom of speech, which is basically don't say anything biblical, that they'll be fined and they'll even be censored.
[01:40:56.551 --> 01:40:58.532]  And by the way, let me throw this in here.
[01:40:58.532 --> 01:40:59.332]  Exactly.
[01:40:59.332 --> 01:41:01.593]  Because our government won't say no to censorship.
[01:41:01.593 --> 01:41:07.035]  It's allowing foreign governments like the EU, Canada, the Chinese to then come say what the policies are.
[01:41:07.035 --> 01:41:11.777]  And so by extension of that power vacuum, we're seeing governance from authoritarian regimes.
[01:41:11.777 --> 01:41:12.978]  And then if you expand on that,
[01:41:13.919 --> 01:41:19.394]  Again, there's more and more and more that they're saying that they find offensive or that they find hateful.
[01:41:19.394 --> 01:41:20.677]  This is extremely dangerous.
[01:41:21.957 --> 01:41:25.599]  Well, you can't have a real democracy unless you have the contrary opinion.
[01:41:25.599 --> 01:41:34.584]  And if you're not allowed to attempt to change somebody's mind, then we're not living in a free democratic society at all.
[01:41:34.584 --> 01:41:36.845]  We're living in a dictatorship.
[01:41:36.845 --> 01:41:40.687]  In fact, if you're a radio listener, this is like Tiananmen Square level stuff.
[01:41:40.687 --> 01:41:48.672]  You're being taken away for saying Jesus loves you at an event that he's supposedly allowed to do.
[01:41:49.298 --> 01:41:51.260]  Yeah, it's a scary slope.
[01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:54.364]  I mean, Canada's definitely going in a bad direction.
[01:41:54.364 --> 01:42:03.856]  You know, just like Omar, she can criticize the Jews, but you sit and you criticize her, you get attacked because, well, now you're attacking Muslims.
[01:42:03.856 --> 01:42:05.178]  As you said, people are being...
[01:42:05.678 --> 01:42:08.521]  Fired off their radio, people are getting fined, they're getting in trouble.
[01:42:08.521 --> 01:42:09.763]  They talk about Ilhan Omar.
[01:42:09.763 --> 01:42:10.824]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:42:10.824 --> 01:42:11.625]  Well, sir, stay there.
[01:42:11.625 --> 01:42:14.548]  I'm really impressed, David, with what you're doing.
[01:42:14.548 --> 01:42:20.915]  I want to show this to people, but if they're a radio listener, folks, you've got to go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:42:20.915 --> 01:42:23.237]  You've got to see this for yourself.
[01:42:23.237 --> 01:42:26.561]  We're about to go to break, sir, but what did they arrest you for specifically?
[01:42:26.561 --> 01:42:27.522]  What are they charging you with?
[01:42:28.502 --> 01:42:30.464]  They're charging me with a breach of the peace.
[01:42:30.464 --> 01:42:36.328]  They couldn't find any hate speech in my words, but they were trying to get me, and they even lied in court.
[01:42:36.328 --> 01:42:38.991]  I didn't even know the prosecutors could do that.
[01:42:38.991 --> 01:42:41.413]  They falsified quotes.
[01:42:41.413 --> 01:42:47.758]  They even vilified me by attaching me to a totally different person.
[01:42:47.758 --> 01:42:53.182]  The majority of the court reading for me to get bail was about somebody else.
[01:42:53.182 --> 01:42:54.043]  Wow, stay there.
[01:42:54.043 --> 01:42:55.104]  Incredible, incredible.
[01:42:57.179 --> 01:43:01.364]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[01:43:01.364 --> 01:43:02.425]  They are technocrats.
[01:43:02.425 --> 01:43:04.707]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:43:04.707 --> 01:43:12.075]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:43:12.075 --> 01:43:13.957]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:43:13.957 --> 01:43:16.040]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:22.906]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:43:22.906 --> 01:43:28.091]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:43:28.091 --> 01:43:37.100]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:43:38.061 --> 01:43:44.065]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[01:43:44.065 --> 01:43:45.005]  It is amazing.
[01:43:45.005 --> 01:43:58.213]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:43:58.213 --> 01:44:04.737]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[01:44:05.595 --> 01:44:09.863]  This is a digital, AI-enforced, gag order.
[01:44:09.863 --> 01:44:13.591]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or Infowars.com.
[01:44:19.246 --> 01:44:20.966]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[01:44:20.966 --> 01:44:22.187]  This is racketeering.
[01:44:22.187 --> 01:44:23.287]  This is cartels.
[01:44:23.287 --> 01:44:25.707]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:44:25.707 --> 01:44:27.587]  We need it now.
[01:44:27.587 --> 01:44:29.268]  You can take on Big Tech.
[01:44:29.268 --> 01:44:38.209]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:46.271]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[01:44:46.271 --> 01:44:47.111]  The way to fight back
[01:44:47.751 --> 01:44:52.592]  ...is to support InfoWars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[01:44:52.592 --> 01:44:58.794]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[01:44:58.794 --> 01:45:03.055]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:45:03.055 --> 01:45:13.437]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[01:45:13.437 --> 01:45:16.558]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale
[01:45:16.758 --> 01:45:17.159]  I don't know.
[01:45:32.876 --> 01:45:42.043]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[01:45:42.043 --> 01:45:50.650]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[01:45:50.650 --> 01:45:53.972]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment.
[01:45:53.972 --> 01:45:57.355]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[01:45:58.687 --> 01:46:04.697]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:04.697 --> 01:46:07.662]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[01:46:07.662 --> 01:46:12.229]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply on the top.
[01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:22.404]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:46:22.404 --> 01:46:27.767]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:46:27.767 --> 01:46:30.028]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:46:30.028 --> 01:46:33.550]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:35.030]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:39.012]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:46:39.012 --> 01:46:41.233]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:46:41.233 --> 01:46:42.314]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:46:42.774 --> 01:46:44.775]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:46:44.775 --> 01:46:47.296]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:46:47.296 --> 01:46:52.299]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:46:52.299 --> 01:47:01.324]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:47:01.324 --> 01:47:04.025]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.269 --> 01:47:22.609]  John Tygan is our guest.
[01:47:22.609 --> 01:47:25.950]  One of the great patriots of Benghazi.
[01:47:25.950 --> 01:47:29.891]  They have bigger heroes having the will to stand up against Hillary.
[01:47:29.891 --> 01:47:32.531]  I think their going public against her is one of the reasons she lost.
[01:47:32.531 --> 01:47:34.432]  It definitely went into the secret sauce that did that.
[01:47:34.432 --> 01:47:35.072]  You agree?
[01:47:35.072 --> 01:47:35.932]  Oh, I totally agree.
[01:47:35.932 --> 01:47:39.153]  I think it definitely ended her run.
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:43.762]  We'll hear more about this after our next guest leaves.
[01:47:43.762 --> 01:47:54.187]  I gotta tell you, David, Jay, Lynn, so much news breaks at NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com that two days ago they were like, hey, cover this, cover this, it's incredible.
[01:47:54.187 --> 01:47:56.468]  And I meant to cover it and I didn't get to it.
[01:47:56.468 --> 01:48:06.954]  Then I got home that night and I watched the video and then I remembered all these other cases in Canada where they're really targeting Christians viciously, but like you said,
[01:48:08.189 --> 01:48:15.194]  Muslim call to prayer inside government buildings, pagan stuff all over, gay pride stuff all over, jobs.
[01:48:15.194 --> 01:48:21.458]  But if you even wear, I've seen articles out of Canada, a cross around your neck, people get pissed.
[01:48:21.458 --> 01:48:23.820]  And I think you were saying that you basically experienced that.
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:25.701]  I want to play some more of this video.
[01:48:25.701 --> 01:48:29.904]  But I got to say, you're a very well-spoken, calm, nice guy.
[01:48:29.904 --> 01:48:30.965]  Nicer than I would have been.
[01:48:30.965 --> 01:48:32.126]  And believe me, I work on it.
[01:48:32.126 --> 01:48:37.730]  When I go out and leftists are in my face, spitting on me, pushing me, dumping coffee on my head, I start, you know,
[01:48:38.010 --> 01:48:38.110]  Amen.
[01:48:38.110 --> 01:48:38.310]  You know, I
[01:49:01.747 --> 01:49:18.241]  I'm in a position right now, it's sad because my sister informed me today that our Toronto Mayor has been siding with the LGBT community and it's inferring that I might not get a fair say.
[01:49:18.241 --> 01:49:19.382]  It's become political.
[01:49:19.382 --> 01:49:24.687]  In fact, the judges ruled totally in favor of the other community and I was assaulted.
[01:49:24.687 --> 01:49:25.908]  I was actually assaulted at
[01:49:26.783 --> 01:49:28.704]  I've got a lawyer that's got lawyers in Canada.
[01:49:28.704 --> 01:49:30.085]  He's actually here right now.
[01:49:30.085 --> 01:49:31.446]  So we'll get Norm Pattis to call you later.
[01:49:56.724 --> 01:50:01.690]  Please, thank you, because, I mean, we're, you know, we're trying to raise funds, we're trying to do everything we can.
[01:50:01.690 --> 01:50:06.315]  Believe me, brother, I know what it's like to try to tell the truth, and I'm not saying I'm a victim, I'm a target.
[01:50:06.315 --> 01:50:14.144]  What is it like for you as a patriot, as an American, to watch this, John, unfolding with what's happening in Canada?
[01:50:14.144 --> 01:50:15.426]  Like you said, this is already coming here.
[01:50:16.323 --> 01:50:18.505]  Yeah, again, it's just very disturbing.
[01:50:18.505 --> 01:50:23.689]  And again, I know what it's like to be targeted as well, obviously, because the left didn't like the fact that we came out and told the truth.
[01:50:23.689 --> 01:50:29.755]  You know, we get attacked every now and then by individuals, and it's sad.
[01:50:29.755 --> 01:50:32.697]  I always wish the officer... Hillary tried to get you killed!
[01:50:32.697 --> 01:50:33.258]  You're the bad guy!
[01:50:34.559 --> 01:50:41.543]  Well, people say that, but you know, she'd be hired to save people that are like me, so it'd be kind of hard.
[01:50:41.543 --> 01:50:47.146]  But, you know, it's... You would wish that... I'm saying, she tried to basically... Culver Magazzi, for sure.
[01:50:47.146 --> 01:50:49.948]  Yeah, yeah, get you guys killed that day, and then you're the bad guys.
[01:50:49.948 --> 01:50:51.169]  How dare you want to live?
[01:50:51.169 --> 01:50:55.791]  Yeah, I mean, because... But I wonder what it's like for her to be surrounded by guys that hate her guts.
[01:50:55.791 --> 01:50:57.653]  And I know a lot of you know more of them than I do.
[01:50:57.653 --> 01:50:59.674]  They literally all say she's a total monster.
[01:51:00.262 --> 01:51:03.284]  Oh yeah, I wish I could tell you the stories I've heard.
[01:51:03.284 --> 01:51:05.005]  I've heard them, we'll talk some about it in a minute.
[01:51:05.005 --> 01:51:11.188]  Well sir, David, I want to invite you back on the war room, I want to invite you back on my show for a full hour to talk about religion and freedom.
[01:51:11.188 --> 01:51:18.713]  But I want to play the rest of the tape we didn't get to of you being arrested, these people are assaulting you, they're pushing you, they're screaming at you, they're spitting on you.
[01:51:18.713 --> 01:51:25.056]  Obviously there's always a lot of footage that people can't see because there's only one camera angle.
[01:51:25.056 --> 01:51:27.538]  The footage your eyes witnessed, what else didn't we see?
[01:51:29.458 --> 01:51:34.826]  So what I want to say is that the police officer was actually a member of the LGBT community.
[01:51:34.826 --> 01:51:40.555]  He was wearing a rainbow flag on his uniform.
[01:51:40.555 --> 01:51:41.817]  So it's a gang now?
[01:51:41.817 --> 01:51:42.417]  It's a gang?
[01:51:44.284 --> 01:51:45.765]  Yes, it was a setup.
[01:51:45.765 --> 01:51:53.149]  Another thing that you didn't notice or someone might not notice is that they were already about to pick at me before I even started preaching.
[01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:56.171]  So it was a setup because I posted my itinerary.
[01:51:56.171 --> 01:52:04.837]  We were going all around Toronto preaching the gospel to everybody and they knew we were coming and they already had their hate ready to be spewed at me.
[01:52:04.837 --> 01:52:06.938]  So they want to silence you, your message of love.
[01:52:08.237 --> 01:52:09.598]  Yes.
[01:52:09.598 --> 01:52:12.822]  And so those are two key ingredients to this whole story.
[01:52:12.822 --> 01:52:17.647]  And I'm actually the victim here, not the aggressor.
[01:52:17.647 --> 01:52:20.329]  I came there... Oh, we've seen the unedited video.
[01:52:20.329 --> 01:52:20.750]  We've got it.
[01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:22.271]  Let's go ahead and roll some more of that right now.
[01:52:22.271 --> 01:52:22.552]  Here it is.
[01:52:24.426 --> 01:52:28.069]  And becoming bigots and hate speech against my religion.
[01:52:28.069 --> 01:52:32.873]  And so if you're willing to look at the evidence, this is all on live stream right now.
[01:52:32.873 --> 01:52:34.975]  City TV News is right here.
[01:52:34.975 --> 01:52:39.118]  So I want to exercise my freedom.
[01:52:39.118 --> 01:52:42.481]  I chose this location as a product of Toronto.
[01:52:42.481 --> 01:52:44.602]  Does this have a special law in George and Wellesley?
[01:52:44.602 --> 01:52:44.742]  No.
[01:52:44.742 --> 01:52:46.043]  But you've chosen this location.
[01:52:46.043 --> 01:52:48.505]  I don't want to continue this conversation anymore.
[01:52:48.505 --> 01:52:51.908]  Officer, I'm going to preach over here and exercise my freedom.
[01:52:53.449 --> 01:52:55.730]  So he's preaching in front of cops.
[01:52:55.730 --> 01:52:57.110]  Now they cheer.
[01:52:57.110 --> 01:52:59.010]  Flip him off.
[01:52:59.010 --> 01:53:07.632]  So he's a Christian saying, I love you, but because he's a Christian, they hate him.
[01:53:07.632 --> 01:53:08.652]  How about bigotry?
[01:53:21.577 --> 01:53:31.960]  You know, people ask if I'm anti-police, I'm pro-police, but not when they're like, these aren't police, these are political thugs.
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:33.620]  These are tyrannical enforcers.
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:34.340]  Shame on them.
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:35.881]  Okay, well I'm being arrested.
[01:53:35.881 --> 01:53:36.801]  For what?
[01:53:36.801 --> 01:53:37.301]  What did I do?
[01:53:37.301 --> 01:53:38.461]  You are not upholding the law.
[01:53:38.461 --> 01:53:39.021]  What did I do?
[01:53:39.021 --> 01:53:42.262]  Yeah, the leftists got angry, they got violent, so he goes to jail.
[01:53:42.262 --> 01:53:43.602]  It's his fault.
[01:53:43.602 --> 01:53:44.743]  What did I do?
[01:53:44.743 --> 01:53:46.543]  I need to know what I did according to the law.
[01:53:47.834 --> 01:53:50.315]  This is against the law.
[01:53:50.315 --> 01:53:52.895]  This is against the law.
[01:53:52.895 --> 01:53:57.596]  Teague, what's really happening here?
[01:53:57.596 --> 01:53:59.136]  You know, they're going after the wrong person.
[01:53:59.136 --> 01:54:02.797]  I mean, they should be going after the aggressors, which were the protesters.
[01:54:02.797 --> 01:54:05.038]  They were the ones getting up in his face and attacking him.
[01:54:05.038 --> 01:54:05.758]  He wasn't.
[01:54:05.758 --> 01:54:07.558]  He was, again, he was just preaching.
[01:54:07.558 --> 01:54:09.098]  And notice he even retreated.
[01:54:09.098 --> 01:54:09.418]  Yeah, he did.
[01:54:09.418 --> 01:54:11.679]  And that's what I've noticed with the left, when you retreat when they attack.
[01:54:12.537 --> 01:54:17.078]  And I'm not saying you're bad, I'm glad you retreated, you're taking the upper, higher road, but man.
[01:54:17.078 --> 01:54:21.060]  Yeah, it's, that thing, it happens here too, it seems like.
[01:54:21.060 --> 01:54:22.260]  It ain't just in Canada.
[01:54:22.260 --> 01:54:29.262]  Oh, I've noticed that whenever they're yelling and screaming at me in the street, it happens all the time, when I left, one'll get there, then two, then more, if I stay on my ground.
[01:54:29.262 --> 01:54:37.285]  It'll be like 50 within about 10 minutes, and then as soon as I gotta leave, they cheer and start chasing me, because they want that feeling of they're in charge, they're routing you.
[01:54:37.285 --> 01:54:41.686]  Even though you're just going to pick your kids up, or going to your job, it's weird psychology.
[01:54:41.866 --> 01:54:42.547]  It is.
[01:54:42.547 --> 01:54:45.592]  It emboldens them, it seems like.
[01:54:45.592 --> 01:54:45.953]  Exactly.
[01:54:45.953 --> 01:54:47.655]  It's like running from a wild dog.
[01:54:47.655 --> 01:54:51.361]  So, David, other points you'd like to make about what unfolded?
[01:54:51.361 --> 01:54:57.050]  It's one thing to read about preachers being arrested for preaching the gospel, but it's another thing to see it.
[01:54:58.806 --> 01:55:07.392]  You know, it's interesting because 30 minutes prior to arriving there, we had a conversation with two police officers, a neutral conversation, because we were preaching in another location.
[01:55:07.392 --> 01:55:10.954]  And what they told me was that there's nothing wrong with sharing a contrary point of view.
[01:55:10.954 --> 01:55:12.295]  You have all right to do that.
[01:55:12.295 --> 01:55:15.357]  If anybody became aggressive, I should call the police.
[01:55:15.357 --> 01:55:16.798]  They should be charged.
[01:55:16.798 --> 01:55:22.062]  And the interesting thing about it is that 30 minutes later, I actually got assaulted.
[01:55:22.571 --> 01:55:25.497]  The police were informed and I ended up getting arrested.
[01:55:25.497 --> 01:55:29.124]  What made things worse was that when I went to the when I went to the prison.
[01:55:30.194 --> 01:55:40.023]  The police station all I was forced to stay there all night and for eight to nine hours while I was there even longer None of the the guards helped me.
[01:55:40.023 --> 01:55:46.849]  I kept knocking on the door I wanted to call my wife and my who just was a gave birth to my three-month-old son.
[01:55:46.849 --> 01:55:49.932]  I nobody This is all on video.
[01:55:49.932 --> 01:55:54.977]  Nobody answered me even when they were in front of my cell they purposely ignored me and
[01:55:55.277 --> 01:56:12.474]  And talk to all the other inmates except me and they wouldn't even allow me to use the phone to call my my wife and I don't know what I did to have this kind of ill treatment but but I was totally unjustly treated in this in this whole situation.
[01:56:12.474 --> 01:56:18.741]  And they're still going ahead with the charges and like you were saying it's in the news that they're gonna try to crucify you as an example that you're gonna shut your mouth.
[01:56:19.690 --> 01:56:23.553]  They gave me bail conditions and what I do for a job is I do this full-time.
[01:56:23.553 --> 01:56:26.315]  I go to different street corners, predominantly Young & Done.
[01:56:26.315 --> 01:56:29.337]  That's the busiest intersection in Canada.
[01:56:29.337 --> 01:56:36.122]  And they gave me guidelines for bail saying that I can't be around any LGBT event.
[01:56:36.122 --> 01:56:38.284]  I can't go into a very broad area.
[01:56:39.106 --> 01:56:42.809]  Where a lot of the LGBT members are.
[01:56:42.809 --> 01:56:46.231]  So the very group you want to preach to about how they're in a cult.
[01:56:46.231 --> 01:56:48.793]  You can say what you want about people and their sexual orientation.
[01:56:48.793 --> 01:56:51.014]  The whole left is using this as a cult.
[01:56:51.014 --> 01:56:52.676]  And they're targeting kids and everything else.
[01:56:52.676 --> 01:56:53.396]  That's incredible.
[01:56:53.396 --> 01:56:57.319]  You've got to come back this Sunday for the Sunday show or on Monday, my friend.
[01:56:57.319 --> 01:57:00.241]  Because I want to do a whole hour on this and really walk through it.
[01:57:00.241 --> 01:57:00.981]  This is amazing.
[01:57:00.981 --> 01:57:03.203]  David J. Lynn.
[01:57:03.203 --> 01:57:04.584]  What's the best website for people to visit?
[01:57:05.836 --> 01:57:07.817]  ChristsForgiveness.com.
[01:57:07.817 --> 01:57:09.057]  It has all this information.
[01:57:09.057 --> 01:57:11.939]  It's Christs with an S, Forgiveness.com.
[01:57:11.939 --> 01:57:14.640]  And you can go to the GoFundMe.

[01:57:16.061 --> 01:57:16.921]  We're not a cult.
[01:57:16.921 --> 01:57:17.801]  We love Jesus.
[01:57:17.801 --> 01:57:19.362]  We stand on the word of God.
[01:57:19.362 --> 01:57:23.304]  And we love all people, but we... Well, sir, obviously you're a well-spoken, nice Christian.
[01:57:23.304 --> 01:57:24.264]  You're the opposite of a cult.
[01:57:24.264 --> 01:57:25.725]  But if you weren't a cult, you have the right.
[01:57:25.725 --> 01:57:27.026]  The cult's what attacked you.
[01:57:27.026 --> 01:57:29.927]  And we damn well know what's going on.
[01:57:29.927 --> 01:57:31.248]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:57:31.248 --> 01:57:33.509]  We'll talk to you again soon, my friend.
[01:57:33.509 --> 01:57:33.969]  God bless you.

[02:00:01.445 --> 02:00:03.827]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:03.827 --> 02:00:05.129]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.498 --> 02:00:48.643]  John T. Teigen is our guest in studio here and you know you're here to promote this event and these things get bigger and bigger and I've heard the Strickler Ranch is an awesome place yeah I'm tempted to try to get up there only an hour north of Austin but I don't see you're a shrieking violet but you know plug this sucker people need to go to this it's very exciting and it goes to a very good cause
[02:00:48.863 --> 02:00:49.123]  It is.
[02:00:49.123 --> 02:00:51.145]  You know, we're bringing about 28 veterans in.
[02:00:51.145 --> 02:00:56.189]  We've got a couple of Medal of Honor recipients, some other VIPs, and we're taking the veterans.
[02:00:56.189 --> 02:00:59.092]  We're going to let them shoot out of the helicopter, probably take them hog hunting.
[02:00:59.092 --> 02:01:01.754]  They can go fishing, you know, canoeing, whatever.
[02:01:01.754 --> 02:01:03.576]  I mean, there's all kinds of stuff out there to do.
[02:01:03.576 --> 02:01:05.117]  This place is kick-ass.
[02:01:05.117 --> 02:01:05.497]  It is.
[02:01:05.497 --> 02:01:12.123]  You know, they do a lot of Spartan races up there, so it's, you know, it's a lot of trails you can walk, you can ride, bike, motorcycle.
[02:01:12.703 --> 02:01:14.905]  Sounds like a big ol' slice of Americana with a side of Texas.
[02:01:27.833 --> 02:01:28.713]  Of course it is.
[02:01:28.713 --> 02:01:35.477]  Then that evening we'll have our fundraiser Saturday, the Gala, which will auction off the one-of-a-kind Tommy gun.
[02:01:35.477 --> 02:01:37.198]  We have an M1 carbine.
[02:01:37.198 --> 02:01:38.258]  Again, that's a one-of-a-kind.
[02:01:38.258 --> 02:01:45.442]  We've got some Vietnam stuff engraved on it in tribute to the Vietnam veterans and some other cool guns that we're going to have out there.
[02:01:46.622 --> 02:01:52.028]  Sunday we have a Redneck Olympics, which is, you can picture a bunch of rednecks doing the Olympics.
[02:01:52.028 --> 02:01:58.375]  So it's like toilet seat, horseshoes, um, you know, uh, geez I can't even think now.
[02:01:58.375 --> 02:02:00.418]  Sunflower seed spitting, so.
[02:02:00.418 --> 02:02:01.399]  All sorts of fun stuff.
[02:02:01.399 --> 02:02:04.242]  Shotgun golf, you know, rifle golf, so.
[02:02:04.242 --> 02:02:05.683]  It's, you know, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:02:05.683 --> 02:02:06.785]  Sounds like I need to come to this.
[02:02:07.185 --> 02:02:10.888]  Yeah, you know, I think we've got about 20 seats open to the public again.
[02:02:10.888 --> 02:02:12.849]  Oh, it's filling up quick.
[02:02:12.849 --> 02:02:17.373]  It's an auctioned off, I think, you can go on the website and see what it is.
[02:02:17.373 --> 02:02:18.313]  You need to expand it then.
[02:02:18.313 --> 02:02:19.815]  I know this place is big.
[02:02:19.815 --> 02:02:20.275]  Oh, it is.
[02:02:20.275 --> 02:02:25.279]  You know, again, this is our first year, so we're hoping it'll grow after this first year.
[02:02:25.279 --> 02:02:29.002]  We were doing it in Colorado, but we decided we wanted to make it bigger, so we moved it to Texas.
[02:02:29.682 --> 02:02:30.202]  Gotta do it.
[02:02:30.202 --> 02:02:34.124]  Hey, you were getting a little upset when I first told you.
[02:02:34.124 --> 02:02:34.964]  Hey guys, pull it up.
[02:02:34.964 --> 02:02:35.265]  Here it is.
[02:02:35.265 --> 02:02:37.386]  When I told you this, you're kind of like, what?
[02:02:37.386 --> 02:02:41.508]  Europe's controversial overhaul of online copyright receives final approval.
[02:02:41.508 --> 02:02:42.808]  That's not the headline, guys.
[02:02:42.808 --> 02:02:48.031]  The actual headline is, was in AP, was in Reuters, Drudge had it linked on Monday and Tuesday.
[02:02:48.031 --> 02:02:48.931]  The actual headline.
[02:02:48.931 --> 02:02:50.532]  I want to show John this before he leaves.
[02:02:51.352 --> 02:02:54.094]  Yeah, it seems like censorship is going crazy around here.
[02:02:54.094 --> 02:02:57.797]  I mean, what are they trying to copyright everything that we do?
[02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:20.501]  I think that's what they're doing.
[02:03:20.501 --> 02:03:21.181]  Where's my phone?
[02:03:21.181 --> 02:03:22.742]  I'll pull it up on my phone.
[02:03:22.742 --> 02:03:24.623]  I have this OCD about headlines.
[02:03:24.623 --> 02:03:25.263]  I can't have them.
[02:03:25.263 --> 02:03:26.784]  I'm going to go crazy.
[02:03:26.784 --> 02:03:30.046]  Bring me Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday stacks.
[02:03:30.046 --> 02:03:32.147]  Bring me the stacks.
[02:03:32.147 --> 02:03:33.568]  There it is.
[02:03:33.568 --> 02:03:34.929]  Now that's Article 13.
[02:03:34.929 --> 02:03:37.070]  You guys aren't clicking news.
[02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:38.411]  You're clicking web.
[02:03:38.411 --> 02:03:42.253]  Article 13 memes exempt as you use controversial copyright law.
[02:03:43.058 --> 02:03:44.959]  Okay.
[02:03:44.959 --> 02:03:45.539]  It doesn't matter.
[02:03:45.539 --> 02:03:50.961]  I'm going to find it and it's going to be so much fun.
[02:03:50.961 --> 02:03:52.862]  Bring me all three stacks.
[02:03:52.862 --> 02:03:55.063]  I covered it Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
[02:03:55.063 --> 02:03:57.684]  The stack will be this high and you'll be gone.
[02:03:57.684 --> 02:04:03.486]  You can tune in and I will have it because imagine the EU declaring jurisdiction over the US.
[02:04:03.486 --> 02:04:03.886]  No.
[02:04:03.886 --> 02:04:05.967]  Yeah, that ain't going to happen.
[02:04:07.205 --> 02:04:08.446]  It's crazy.
[02:04:08.446 --> 02:04:09.907]  Yeah.
[02:04:09.907 --> 02:04:16.151]  In the last minute we have, I presume, coming in, what would you call this period of time, John, we're in right now?
[02:04:16.151 --> 02:04:16.991]  Complete chaos.
[02:04:16.991 --> 02:04:22.095]  I mean, definitely, it seems like anything that's traditional is being attacked.
[02:04:22.095 --> 02:04:26.077]  I mean, everything's trying to be erased and rewritten by the left.
[02:04:26.077 --> 02:04:29.640]  I mean, if it's a positive message, they don't like it.
[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:31.381]  That's what it seems like to me, anyways.
[02:04:31.381 --> 02:04:32.581]  It is certainly a crazy time.
[02:04:32.581 --> 02:04:34.503]  Alright, well, you were in here, what, two years ago?
[02:04:35.325 --> 02:04:36.806]  Yeah, something like that.
[02:04:36.806 --> 02:04:39.488]  Well, let's get you in more often than two years, alright?
[02:04:39.488 --> 02:04:40.829]  It's a busy life, man.
[02:04:40.829 --> 02:04:41.369]  I know, I hear you.
[02:04:41.369 --> 02:04:42.050]  Thanks for coming in, buddy.
[02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:42.370]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:42.370 --> 02:04:42.890]  Thank you.
[02:04:42.890 --> 02:04:52.316]  Congratulations on all the success spreading Americana to the four corners of the planet and outliving that witch's wish to exterminate you, the whore Hillary.
[02:04:52.316 --> 02:04:53.017]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:53.017 --> 02:04:53.737]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:06:00.864 --> 02:06:02.884]  The tip of the spear.
[02:06:02.884 --> 02:06:05.645]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:15.866 --> 02:06:20.175]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[02:06:20.175 --> 02:06:24.543]  Say the joker to the thief.
[02:06:24.543 --> 02:06:26.227]  There's too much confusion.
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:48.195]  I want to pay you credit for this, because when we spoke in Davos after the... I want to pay you credit for this, because when we spoke in Davos after the Las Vegas mass shooting, I brought up the issue of bump fire stock and why it was legal when it was used to convert legal weapons to illegal ones.
[02:06:48.195 --> 02:06:49.936]  And you did ban bump fire stock.
[02:06:49.936 --> 02:06:50.517]  I ended it.
[02:06:50.517 --> 02:06:52.298]  I don't think you got enough credit for that.
[02:06:52.298 --> 02:06:56.702]  There's just been another massacre in Virginia Beach where the shooter used a silencer.
[02:06:57.402 --> 02:06:59.543]  What is your view of silences?
[02:06:59.543 --> 02:07:00.844]  Would you like to see those banned?
[02:07:00.844 --> 02:07:02.505]  Well, I'd like to think about it.
[02:07:02.505 --> 02:07:04.867]  I mean, nobody's talked about silences very much.
[02:07:04.867 --> 02:07:07.368]  They did talk about the bump stock, and we had it banned.
[02:07:07.368 --> 02:07:09.229]  And we're looking at that.
[02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:12.371]  I'm going to seriously look at it.
[02:07:12.371 --> 02:07:13.992]  I don't love the idea of it.
[02:07:13.992 --> 02:07:14.792]  I don't like the idea.
[02:07:14.792 --> 02:07:17.954]  What's happening is crazy.
[02:07:17.954 --> 02:07:18.314]  Okay?
[02:07:18.314 --> 02:07:19.495]  It's crazy.
[02:07:19.495 --> 02:07:22.217]  What's going on with schools, and not only in our country.
[02:07:22.217 --> 02:07:23.938]  I mean, not only in our country, but again,
[02:07:24.318 --> 02:07:26.600]  But America has a particular issue with gun violence.
[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:28.502]  You and I have discussed this for years.
[02:07:28.502 --> 02:07:31.926]  There's been 150 mass shootings in America this year alone.
[02:07:31.926 --> 02:07:34.669]  In Britain, we have 35 gun deaths a year.
[02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:37.111]  In America today, there'll be 85.
[02:07:37.111 --> 02:07:38.573]  Tomorrow, 85 and so on.
[02:07:38.573 --> 02:07:40.855]  What can you do to change the culture?
[02:07:40.855 --> 02:07:42.457]  In London, you have stabbings all over.
[02:07:42.457 --> 02:07:44.439]  I read an article where everyone's being stabbed.
[02:07:44.439 --> 02:07:46.261]  We've had about 50-odd stabbings.
[02:07:46.661 --> 02:07:49.723]  We've had 50-odd murders with knives this year in London.
[02:07:49.723 --> 02:07:53.546]  Well, they said your hospital is a sea of blood all over the floors.
[02:07:53.546 --> 02:07:55.087]  I'm not going to deny we have a problem with knife crime.
[02:07:55.087 --> 02:07:56.448]  It's a sea of blood and they don't have the guns.
[02:07:56.448 --> 02:07:57.408]  We have a problem with knife crime.
[02:07:57.408 --> 02:08:01.731]  What do you think you can do as a president, though, to change the mindset about gun violence in America?
[02:08:01.731 --> 02:08:02.612]  Just talk about it.
[02:08:02.612 --> 02:08:04.013]  You have to talk about it.
[02:08:04.013 --> 02:08:11.838]  But, Piers, when somebody has a gun illegally and nobody else has a gun because the laws are that you can't have a gun, those people are gone.
[02:08:11.838 --> 02:08:12.778]  They have no choice.
[02:08:12.778 --> 02:08:14.279]  They have no chance.
[02:08:14.279 --> 02:08:15.120]  They have no chance.
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:16.361]  It's a very tough subject.
[02:08:17.142 --> 02:08:19.905]  But the bad guys are not getting rid of their guns.
[02:08:19.905 --> 02:08:21.967]  Pretty much everybody agrees with that.
[02:08:21.967 --> 02:08:27.192]  The people that obey the laws, if there was a law passed, they get rid... Those people are sitting ducks.
[02:08:27.192 --> 02:08:34.780]  You know, the one I think about the most is Paris, where they had so many people killed, where that wacky group of people went into the nightclub.
[02:08:35.521 --> 02:08:38.843]  And they just, boom, boom, boom.
[02:08:38.843 --> 02:08:45.406]  And they killed, like, tremendous numbers of people, horribly injured, so many more still in the hospital, I read the other day.
[02:08:45.406 --> 02:08:52.510]  No, but if we had, if there was a gun on the other side, if one or two or three of those people had a gun, it would have never happened.
[02:08:52.510 --> 02:08:53.911]  Here's my problem with that argument.
[02:08:53.911 --> 02:09:00.034]  More people were shot dead in America that week than have died from guns in Paris since the Second World War.
[02:09:00.034 --> 02:09:03.856]  I'm just telling you... I mean, the stats are so against that argument, aren't they?
[02:09:03.976 --> 02:09:04.817]  Well, what are you going to do?
[02:09:04.817 --> 02:09:06.439]  Are you going to take the guns away from hunters?
[02:09:06.439 --> 02:09:07.380]  You have hunters.
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:09.762]  No, I think you can have special licenses for hunters.
[02:09:09.762 --> 02:09:15.648]  Actually, I sort of subscribe to the view of the right to bear arms, allowing someone to have a handgun or something, the home thing.
[02:09:15.648 --> 02:09:22.035]  I don't understand, I never have understood why anyone in America needs a semi-automatic AR-15 assault rifle at home.
[02:09:22.785 --> 02:09:28.251]  Well, a lot of them use them for entertainment, they do.
[02:09:28.251 --> 02:09:29.772]  For some people it's entertainment.
[02:09:29.772 --> 02:09:33.236]  They go out and they shoot and they go to ranges and they have a tremendous amount of fun.
[02:09:33.236 --> 02:09:35.238]  It's all shooting and specific hunting with licenses.
[02:09:35.238 --> 02:09:36.019]  I get that.
[02:09:36.019 --> 02:09:37.561]  What I don't get is the need.
[02:09:37.561 --> 02:09:38.662]  This guy in Vegas had 13.
[02:09:40.363 --> 02:09:42.324]  AR-15 assault rifles.
[02:09:42.324 --> 02:09:44.624]  He'd bought 52 guns in one year.
[02:09:44.624 --> 02:09:48.766]  And he was a sick guy, and if it wasn't guns, he would have done bombs, or he would have done something else.
[02:09:48.766 --> 02:09:50.346]  He was actually a pretty smart guy.
[02:09:50.346 --> 02:09:56.148]  He was supposedly a good, successful gambler, and there's almost no such thing as a successful gambler.
[02:09:56.148 --> 02:09:58.869]  And he went out, and what he did was incredible.
[02:09:58.869 --> 02:10:00.849]  Well, you did something.
[02:10:00.849 --> 02:10:03.970]  To give you credit on that again, you did get bump-fired stock.
[02:10:03.970 --> 02:10:04.791]  He used the bump stock.
[02:10:04.791 --> 02:10:05.611]  You got it banged.
[02:10:05.871 --> 02:10:06.932]  And that will make a difference.
[02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:07.412]  Good.
[02:10:07.412 --> 02:10:09.273]  I urge you to carry on doing something on guns.
[02:10:09.273 --> 02:10:09.833]  Okay, thank you.
[02:10:09.833 --> 02:10:15.677]  Because I think it would be great if the American gun violence could be reduced in some way.
[02:10:15.677 --> 02:10:16.878]  I think we would both agree on that.
[02:10:16.878 --> 02:10:17.198]  Thank you.
[02:10:17.198 --> 02:10:17.378]  We do.
[02:10:28.945 --> 02:10:48.630]  In 2018, in the United States of America, tech giants Facebook, Apple, and Google have deemed the information coming from Alex Jones to be too dangerous for public consumption and have forbidden him from having a voice.
[02:10:48.630 --> 02:10:52.771]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive.
[02:10:54.474 --> 02:10:56.716]  Never defeat the human spirit!
[02:10:56.716 --> 02:11:09.285]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he's been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[02:11:10.623 --> 02:11:11.544]  He predicted 9-11.
[02:11:11.544 --> 02:11:20.672]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIA asset in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[02:11:20.672 --> 02:11:24.576]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[02:11:29.372 --> 02:11:31.974]  Babylon Mystery Religion Ceremony!
[02:11:31.974 --> 02:11:36.636]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[02:11:36.636 --> 02:11:40.758]  Prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[02:11:40.758 --> 02:11:44.060]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg Group et al.
[02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:48.623]  And most of you are a bunch of stinkin' parasites!
[02:11:48.623 --> 02:11:56.707]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[02:11:56.707 --> 02:11:57.928]  They falsely edited him.
[02:12:00.438 --> 02:12:04.459]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[02:12:04.459 --> 02:12:12.521]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[02:12:12.521 --> 02:12:20.562]  And now he is being de-platformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[02:12:20.562 --> 02:12:25.363]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[02:12:25.363 --> 02:12:27.464]  And then we get hit and say, you no longer use our software.
[02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:32.092]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[02:12:32.092 --> 02:12:33.794]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[02:12:33.794 --> 02:12:35.816]  They just killed our stream.
[02:12:35.816 --> 02:12:36.236]  Really?
[02:12:36.236 --> 02:12:36.596]  Yep.
[02:12:36.596 --> 02:12:40.860]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:44.864]  This is America.
[02:12:44.864 --> 02:12:49.028]  This is America in 2018.
[02:12:49.028 --> 02:12:54.413]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[02:12:56.641 --> 02:12:58.783]  Will you do nothing?
[02:12:58.783 --> 02:13:03.548]  While history is being recorded, will you sit and do nothing?
[02:13:03.548 --> 02:13:11.537]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[02:13:11.537 --> 02:13:16.482]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:13:23.337 --> 02:13:28.980]  Alright folks, we're back live on this Friday edition of Broadcasting Worldwide.
[02:13:28.980 --> 02:13:40.105]  And, you know, really, sitting back and looking at all of this, the left is just an authoritarian outreach of global government.
[02:13:41.209 --> 02:13:49.593]  And they're allied with the Chinese communists, they're allied with radical Islam, and they hate Christians, and they hate families, and they hate babies.
[02:13:49.593 --> 02:13:52.094]  And we're not just saying that to demonize them.
[02:13:52.094 --> 02:13:55.655]  They're the party of the bad people.
[02:13:55.655 --> 02:14:05.900]  And when you go look at liberals, whether they're in Canada, or whether they're in Asia, or whether they're... They all look like mentally lobotomized zombies or something.
[02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:08.021]  Because I wouldn't even call all of us conservatives.
[02:14:09.005 --> 02:14:11.827]  But just pro-human, common-sense type people.
[02:14:11.827 --> 02:14:17.732]  We're very open-minded, we're very tolerant, but we won't be dominated, won't have our views changed.
[02:14:17.732 --> 02:14:25.058]  So the left, before they took over, they were tolerant because they wanted you to be tolerant of them, but they're not tolerant of us.
[02:14:25.058 --> 02:14:32.564]  And they seek after power, and they seek after virtue signaling to each other about how great they are and how good they are.
[02:14:33.991 --> 02:14:45.234]  Now I'm going to come back and hit some other reports that I've been breaking on some big issues that we haven't hit yet, and what's happening with the tariffs on the economy, and so much more.
[02:14:45.234 --> 02:14:51.036]  And then I've said I'm going to do this for a week or so, and I haven't done it, and the contest is over in a few days.
[02:14:51.036 --> 02:15:01.439]  So I want to play some of these great reports that people have entered for a $5,000 contest for street activism, getting the word about M4s being censored out.
[02:15:02.361 --> 02:15:04.461]  So, very, very exciting.
[02:15:04.461 --> 02:15:06.802]  That's all coming up.
[02:15:06.802 --> 02:15:22.325]  But I'll say it for the thousandth time, like I said this week, every day, at AP and Reuters and all the top news headlines everywhere you saw, on Drug Report, everywhere else, that the EU is declaring jurisdiction over the Internet.
[02:15:22.325 --> 02:15:23.766]  Worldwide.
[02:15:23.766 --> 02:15:28.127]  And because we haven't stood up to that, by extension, they now have that control.
[02:15:28.127 --> 02:15:28.707]  That is a
[02:15:30.011 --> 02:15:32.112]  Big deal, and we did find it, Bloomberg.
[02:15:32.112 --> 02:15:36.756]  Facebook may be told to censor users' hateful posts globally.
[02:15:36.756 --> 02:15:38.137]  That's just one of them.
[02:15:38.137 --> 02:15:41.419]  European Union considers international crackdown on Facebook hate speech.
[02:15:41.419 --> 02:15:43.460]  See, this is here.
[02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:46.563]  The left, the globalists opening the borders are making their move.
[02:15:46.563 --> 02:15:51.086]  This is a global war, and things are going to get real bad if we don't stand up to this.
[02:15:51.086 --> 02:15:52.507]  This is beyond critical.
[02:15:55.700 --> 02:16:00.762]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[02:16:00.762 --> 02:16:06.125]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[02:16:06.125 --> 02:16:14.169]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:26.491]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:26.491 --> 02:16:30.393]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.393 --> 02:16:31.934]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:31.934 --> 02:16:34.896]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:34.896 --> 02:16:40.459]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:40.459 --> 02:16:41.659]  I can help you, too.
[02:16:41.659 --> 02:16:44.601]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:16:44.601 --> 02:16:46.822]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:16:54.827 --> 02:17:01.173]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:01.173 --> 02:17:04.215]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:04.215 --> 02:17:10.161]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:10.161 --> 02:17:13.944]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:13.944 --> 02:17:14.865]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:15.185 --> 02:17:16.205]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:16.205 --> 02:17:22.728]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:22.728 --> 02:17:24.749]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:24.749 --> 02:17:27.391]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.

[02:17:58.180 --> 02:18:00.041]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:18:00.041 --> 02:18:00.922]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[02:18:00.922 --> 02:18:02.263]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:18:02.263 --> 02:18:03.804]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:18:03.804 --> 02:18:04.585]  I'm so excited.
[02:18:04.585 --> 02:18:05.505]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:18:05.505 --> 02:18:07.987]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:18:07.987 --> 02:18:10.489]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[02:18:10.489 --> 02:18:11.910]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:11.910 --> 02:18:13.351]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:13.351 --> 02:18:14.732]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:14.732 --> 02:18:15.993]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:15.993 --> 02:18:20.756]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:18:20.756 --> 02:18:22.177]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:22.177 --> 02:18:23.578]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:23.578 --> 02:18:24.759]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:28.541]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:18:28.541 --> 02:18:32.724]  My daughter uses the Bubble Gum Fluoride 3 toothpaste.
[02:18:32.724 --> 02:18:36.506]  I've used the Super Male Vitality, a host of other products.
[02:18:36.506 --> 02:18:38.568]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:18:38.568 --> 02:18:41.129]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[02:18:41.129 --> 02:18:41.870]  I'm thanking you.
[02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:48.314]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[02:18:48.314 --> 02:18:49.054]  It is next level.
[02:18:49.054 --> 02:18:49.715]  It really is good.
[02:18:49.715 --> 02:18:50.275]  So thank you.
[02:18:50.275 --> 02:18:52.196]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:18:52.196 --> 02:18:52.577]  Thank you.

[02:19:47.242 --> 02:19:49.723]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today!
[02:19:59.764 --> 02:20:09.310]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:09.310 --> 02:20:15.995]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:15.995 --> 02:20:26.221]  So, two days ago, the producers of this show said, do you want to have guests on from the straight pride parade in Boston?
[02:20:26.221 --> 02:20:26.782]  And I said, no.
[02:20:28.593 --> 02:20:34.860]  I said, if people try to violate their free speech, though, then I want them on, which will probably happen.
[02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:49.115]  Because, see, you can have a black pride group, you can have an organization of African Americans, you can have a Hispanic group like Metro La Raza, but white people can't have an organization because being white is inherently bad.
[02:20:49.115 --> 02:20:50.317]  How racist is that?
[02:20:51.843 --> 02:20:58.748]  And so yes, everywhere you go, the force feeding of an alternative lifestyle is going on.
[02:20:58.748 --> 02:21:08.176]  So when I say that I'm a libertarian and I don't try to judge people off their personal activities, that doesn't mean that I don't have a view that something somebody's doing could be destructive or bad.
[02:21:09.735 --> 02:21:17.158]  But if you look at Hollywood and the whole culture, they are exploiting people that are in the gay and lesbian lifestyle.
[02:21:17.158 --> 02:21:25.961]  The numbers of abuse and drug abuse and suicide and family violence, spousal violence is just unprecedented.
[02:21:25.961 --> 02:21:31.043]  That doesn't mean there aren't some people that are really nice and live wonderful lives, little picket fences.
[02:21:31.043 --> 02:21:35.205]  It's just that the truth is, these are very nihilistic, destructive communities.
[02:21:36.545 --> 02:21:45.351]  And, you know, I don't say that from some high horse like I have been an angel cake myself, you know, in my life with things I've done.
[02:21:45.351 --> 02:22:00.200]  But it's just crazy how there's the seeking out of the children and the seeking out to violate other people's rights all over the world and street preachers being arrested and just the real wild-eyed authoritarianism.
[02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:01.881]  It's like the pro-vaccine lobby.
[02:22:01.881 --> 02:22:03.182]  You've had your vaccine.
[02:22:03.182 --> 02:22:04.663]  You're protected supposedly.
[02:22:04.663 --> 02:22:05.664]  Why do I need to take it?
[02:22:06.581 --> 02:22:09.844]  You just want to get pissed off at me.
[02:22:09.844 --> 02:22:12.847]  So what you've got is a bunch of followers.
[02:22:12.847 --> 02:22:31.045]  And you've also got a lot of people that aren't alphas, or aspiring alphas, who get recruited into the homosexual lifestyle, not because they were actually attracted to the same sex, but because no one was attracted to them, and they kind of got sucked into it.
[02:22:32.236 --> 02:22:44.280]  And so if anything is a gang, you know, you got the Crips, you got the Bloods, some churches are gangs, cults, let's just admit it, a lot of the LGBT community is a damn cult!
[02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:52.003]  A damn cult of leftism abusing people, and blackmailing people, and controlling people, and it's not healthy, and it's not good.
[02:22:52.981 --> 02:22:57.222]  You know, Mick Jagger famously said, oh, you get to a certain age, you learn everybody's bisexual.
[02:22:57.222 --> 02:23:02.524]  Well, Mick Jagger, not everybody's worth a billion dollars like you and running around in palaces all day.
[02:23:02.524 --> 02:23:03.485]  People have got families.
[02:23:03.485 --> 02:23:05.185]  They're leading lives.
[02:23:05.185 --> 02:23:06.345]  They're trying to pay their bills.
[02:23:06.345 --> 02:23:12.488]  They don't have time to hop around in, you know, fancy outfits all day and have sex with five dudes and ten women.
[02:23:12.488 --> 02:23:16.449]  So, this is really a decadent situation that we've gotten down to.
[02:23:17.435 --> 02:23:27.763]  And then you've got all these people in Hollywood and all these billionaires wanting to export their lifestyles onto us when we just want to have grandkids.
[02:23:27.763 --> 02:23:30.725]  But you see, the globalists, they don't want us to have grandkids.
[02:23:30.725 --> 02:23:31.986]  They don't want us to have cultures.
[02:23:31.986 --> 02:23:35.709]  They're all over the news saying the family sucks, the family's bad, get rid of it.
[02:23:35.709 --> 02:23:43.395]  You've got all the videos of them having dead babies fight with each other and abortion doctors having sex with dead babies.
[02:23:43.395 --> 02:23:46.057]  And yeah, we're not going to show that, obviously, but there's been indictments.
[02:23:47.383 --> 02:23:51.244]  What, you want to see baby dead babies being made to fight like a boxing match again?
[02:23:51.244 --> 02:23:52.905]  They'll never get to be in a real boxing match.
[02:23:52.905 --> 02:23:54.885]  They'll never get to go play soccer.
[02:23:54.885 --> 02:23:59.146]  They'll never get to have friends or go to school or get to be cool.
[02:23:59.146 --> 02:24:01.047]  What's that famous song about?
[02:24:01.047 --> 02:24:05.188]  Keep on rockin' in the free world.
[02:24:05.188 --> 02:24:06.388]  Now there's a woman in the dark.
[02:24:06.388 --> 02:24:08.849]  She's got a baby in her hands.
[02:24:08.849 --> 02:24:10.090]  But you know, she wants to take a hit.
[02:24:10.090 --> 02:24:11.350]  That's one more kid that'll never
[02:24:12.492 --> 02:24:14.612]  Be cool, get to go to school.
[02:24:14.612 --> 02:24:16.753]  Let's intro the next segment with that if we can pull it up.
[02:24:16.753 --> 02:24:18.893]  By the way, this crew is badass.
[02:24:18.893 --> 02:24:23.514]  How they pull up stuff so fast that I kind of flip out on air, it has nothing to do with them.
[02:24:23.514 --> 02:24:32.256]  It is a neurotic thing I've developed, where I have all this data in my brain, and I know it sounds insane, and then I've got to show it to you.
[02:24:32.256 --> 02:24:37.937]  Like, I've got to show you the dead babies being made to fight with each other by two scumbag doctors.
[02:24:37.937 --> 02:24:38.837]  I don't want to watch it.
[02:24:39.827 --> 02:24:41.248]  But I need to watch it, you see.
[02:24:41.248 --> 02:24:43.850]  Because I need to get pissed and do something, you see.
[02:24:43.850 --> 02:24:45.772]  And see, they pulled it up, newswars.com.
[02:24:45.772 --> 02:24:49.395]  You need to get that out to everybody that thinks abortion is so cool or so fun.
[02:24:49.395 --> 02:24:56.340]  Let's look at some six-pound babies that never got to go to school, never got to have friends, never got to be cool.
[02:24:56.340 --> 02:24:57.882]  Keep on rockin' in the free world.
[02:24:57.882 --> 02:24:58.562]  Yeah, roll it!
[02:24:58.562 --> 02:24:59.583]  Roll it!
[02:24:59.583 --> 02:25:00.664]  Roll it for TV viewers!
[02:25:00.664 --> 02:25:01.725]  Let's look at it!
[02:25:01.725 --> 02:25:02.705]  Let's see it!
[02:25:02.705 --> 02:25:03.606]  Let's know it!
[02:25:03.606 --> 02:25:05.468]  Let's see what you've signed on to!
[02:25:07.541 --> 02:25:12.844]  Oh, the whole LGBT, you're so bullied against, everybody's so against you.
[02:25:12.844 --> 02:25:33.437]  You have the highest rates of education, highest rates of pay, highest rates of everything, and you're bitching and complaining that in your narcissistic, nihilistic, drug-fueled lifestyle, that somehow, if some of us just want to go fishing, or eat a plate of enchiladas, or drink a cold beer,
[02:25:34.738 --> 02:25:37.339]  And we don't want to shove gerbils up our ass.
[02:25:37.339 --> 02:25:42.522]  Because we don't want to do that, we're the bad guys.
[02:25:42.522 --> 02:25:43.282]  I'm sorry.
[02:25:43.282 --> 02:25:45.804]  I'm not even against Lemmy Winks.
[02:25:45.804 --> 02:25:48.525]  But you saw what happened to Lemmy Winks.
[02:25:48.525 --> 02:25:51.407]  It was a brave adventure.
[02:25:51.407 --> 02:25:55.108]  The bravest adventure on the road to Mordor.
[02:25:55.108 --> 02:25:56.609]  So we can talk about this all day.
[02:25:56.609 --> 02:25:58.350]  I'm not looking at what's on screen.
[02:25:58.350 --> 02:25:59.691]  But this is the true dark side.
[02:25:59.691 --> 02:26:01.912]  I'm going to break.
[02:26:01.912 --> 02:26:03.873]  You've got this commitment from me, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:26:04.983 --> 02:26:07.084]  You've got this commitment from me a trillion percent.
[02:26:07.084 --> 02:26:09.285]  I won't compromise on the Second Amendment.
[02:26:09.285 --> 02:26:11.625]  I won't compromise on national sovereignty.
[02:26:11.625 --> 02:26:13.706]  I won't compromise when it comes to the unborn.
[02:26:13.706 --> 02:26:15.407]  And it's not because I'm Mr. Goody Two-Shoes.
[02:26:15.407 --> 02:26:18.428]  It's because my soul's on the line.
[02:26:18.428 --> 02:26:20.228]  And I'm not about to forfeit that for anybody.
[02:26:23.717 --> 02:26:33.859]  Without you supporting us, and I know you know this and I want to thank you, but without you supporting us and thanking your local AM and FM stations and tithing to them once a month or tithing to us.
[02:26:33.859 --> 02:26:34.980]  We're not tax exempt.
[02:26:34.980 --> 02:26:36.560]  We're an information warfare operation.
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:38.001]  It's pro-America.
[02:26:38.001 --> 02:26:47.483]  But the point is, if you just get your coffee and you just get your toothpaste and you just get things like fish oil that everybody should be taking for your brain and heart, whether you're an adult or a child, every day we have the best three brands out there.
[02:26:48.323 --> 02:26:51.284]  We've got the best turmeric, and I'm glad listeners get this.
[02:26:51.284 --> 02:26:56.746]  We have 95% curcuminoid in bodies that no one else has.
[02:26:56.746 --> 02:26:58.647]  We go and pay the top company in the U.S.
[02:26:58.647 --> 02:27:03.348]  that owns the patents to create the concentrated curcuminoid that is off the charts.
[02:27:03.348 --> 02:27:10.351]  And people get this and are so blown away about their joints and pain they have and just everything and what it does for your blood.
[02:27:11.735 --> 02:27:21.365]  Point is, Infoworkstore.com, you have that commitment from us that any product we sell you, in fact, I never got to this today, but maybe at the end of the show we'll play it.
[02:27:21.365 --> 02:27:26.731]  I just happened along a fan-made video about Prostagard.
[02:27:26.731 --> 02:27:27.792]  And he took it.
[02:27:28.758 --> 02:27:29.038]  I don't
[02:27:49.557 --> 02:27:54.659]  And he's like, well, you know, some brands are only $20, but this is $29.95.
[02:27:54.659 --> 02:27:55.919]  Well, it's $24.95 right now.
[02:27:55.919 --> 02:28:01.441]  Yeah, sir, that's because it has 10 ingredients in it, all sourced to be the best.
[02:28:01.441 --> 02:28:07.282]  But obviously anyone that takes it, some brands are $50 and aren't even as good.
[02:28:07.282 --> 02:28:16.285]  We go out and we say, what is the most quality, concentrated, popular prostate brand you could put out?
[02:28:16.285 --> 02:28:19.166]  Like, we know you're manufacturing for seven or eight people.
[02:28:20.823 --> 02:28:22.526]  What could you do to top all of them?
[02:28:22.526 --> 02:28:25.631]  Well, we do this, we do that, we do this, we do that.
[02:28:25.631 --> 02:28:28.015]  And we go around to all these manufacturers, and then that's what we bring.
[02:28:28.015 --> 02:28:29.918]  That's our Prostagard.
[02:28:29.918 --> 02:28:31.521]  That's what people go, my God, this works better than anything else.
[02:28:32.395 --> 02:28:36.438]  And look, even the crappy brands work really good, because Mother Nature's real, folks.
[02:28:36.438 --> 02:28:40.941]  Drugs and all this stuff from Big Pharma are a rip-off of what's already in nature.

[02:31:57.580 --> 02:31:59.302]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:31:59.302 --> 02:32:00.803]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[02:32:00.803 --> 02:32:02.865]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:32:02.865 --> 02:32:07.749]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:32:07.749 --> 02:32:11.572]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:32:11.572 --> 02:32:19.618]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:32:20.559 --> 02:32:23.341]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[02:32:23.341 --> 02:32:30.607]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[02:32:30.607 --> 02:32:34.571]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[02:32:34.571 --> 02:32:40.516]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[02:32:40.516 --> 02:32:45.059]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:32:45.059 --> 02:32:48.102]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment!
[02:32:50.433 --> 02:32:52.476]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:18.684 --> 02:33:21.846]  The globalists are trying to collapse this country.
[02:33:21.846 --> 02:33:23.627]  Period.
[02:33:23.627 --> 02:33:25.689]  Massive amounts of drugs are being allowed in.
[02:33:25.689 --> 02:33:26.689]  Borders are totally open.
[02:33:26.689 --> 02:33:28.130]  Diseases pouring in.
[02:33:28.130 --> 02:33:30.332]  The demoralization of the family.
[02:33:30.332 --> 02:33:31.512]  Killing babies after they're born.
[02:33:31.512 --> 02:33:35.555]  Crank it up.
[02:33:35.555 --> 02:33:37.576]  It's Neil Young.
[02:33:37.576 --> 02:33:39.518]  Crankin' us in.
[02:33:39.518 --> 02:33:41.559]  There's a lady in the night.
[02:33:41.559 --> 02:33:42.840]  She's got a baby in her arms.
[02:34:12.175 --> 02:34:14.457]  That's liberal to kill those babies.
[02:34:14.457 --> 02:34:18.720]  Because the left believes they get more money and power when they kill babies.
[02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:20.701]  They say they're the moral hierarchy, they're the bosses.
[02:34:22.014 --> 02:34:26.798]  Alright, we've launched a lot of contests over the years, and it's not about the $5,000 prize.
[02:34:26.798 --> 02:34:31.522]  That just makes it fun to recognize who everybody thinks did the best video.
[02:34:31.522 --> 02:34:33.523]  And we've gotten 15 or so really good entries.
[02:34:33.523 --> 02:34:34.864]  We're going to play some of them right now.
[02:34:34.864 --> 02:34:37.206]  There's four or five days left in this.
[02:34:37.206 --> 02:34:47.695]  You go out and you just put out different posters about Alex Jones or about InfoWars or about free speech, and then you try to get local news to cover it and freak out over your speech.
[02:34:49.460 --> 02:34:55.062]  America leads charge against death of the West is the latest article with the latest entries.
[02:34:55.062 --> 02:35:03.145]  Free speech poster challenge brings fight for Western civilization to your neighborhood.
[02:35:03.145 --> 02:35:04.325]  So the latest entries are up there.
[02:35:04.325 --> 02:35:06.306]  We're going to play a few of these clips.
[02:35:08.174 --> 02:35:11.496]  And then Dr. Nick Baggage takes over in the fourth hour.
[02:35:11.496 --> 02:35:13.798]  But just look at some of the new articles breaking.
[02:35:13.798 --> 02:35:26.327]  Passing on Sleeping Giant's founder, the guy that runs all these censorship brigades, continues to harass companies to block ad dollars to conservatives while he represents the same companies in his day job.
[02:35:26.327 --> 02:35:27.207]  Wow!
[02:35:27.207 --> 02:35:28.508]  Talk about evil.
[02:35:28.508 --> 02:35:29.089]  And U.S.
[02:35:29.089 --> 02:35:35.934]  government welcomes back two more ISIS brides and they're spawned back in to the United States.
[02:35:37.039 --> 02:35:40.140]  They'll probably be working at the NSA by the end of the week.
[02:35:40.140 --> 02:35:43.700]  And they've caught another ISIS fighter and they came to the Texas border.
[02:35:43.700 --> 02:35:46.041]  This is just crazy.
[02:35:46.041 --> 02:35:47.701]  And the crew did find it.
[02:35:47.701 --> 02:35:49.662]  Bloomberg and others.
[02:35:49.662 --> 02:35:52.862]  EU says they have jurisdiction globally over the internet.
[02:35:52.862 --> 02:35:55.043]  Just an incredible time to be alive.
[02:35:55.043 --> 02:36:00.684]  But imagine how bad it'd be if we weren't on air and if you weren't out there spreading the word and taking action.
[02:36:00.684 --> 02:36:03.585]  Thank our lucky stars, all of us, that at least we care about what's going on.
[02:36:03.585 --> 02:36:03.965]  But wow!
[02:36:04.912 --> 02:36:08.713]  We are watching biblical things unfold right now.
[02:36:08.713 --> 02:36:13.975]  I'll be back to, don't forget this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:36:13.975 --> 02:36:23.597]  And I'm tempted to just open the phones up about Trump coming out and saying he may ban suppressors.
[02:36:23.597 --> 02:36:28.799]  He probably doesn't know that that is the fastest growing thing in firearms and very rarely used in a crime.
[02:36:28.799 --> 02:36:32.980]  And I just hate to have to go after Trump on that, but that is just mind-blowing.
[02:36:34.261 --> 02:36:34.742]  I do want to salute
[02:36:57.728 --> 02:37:04.134]  All of the folks that have entered the contest, again, see some of the top entries of the new posting at NewsWorks.com.
[02:37:04.134 --> 02:37:09.919]  But let's go ahead and go to Can We Save the West by Mr. Real News.
[02:37:09.919 --> 02:37:10.260]  Here it is.
[02:37:13.563 --> 02:37:18.845]  From the introduction of Pat Buchanan's masterpiece, The Death of the West.
[02:37:18.845 --> 02:37:20.346]  The West is dying.
[02:37:20.346 --> 02:37:25.808]  Its nations have ceased to reproduce and their populations have stopped growing and begun to shrink.
[02:37:25.808 --> 02:37:33.911]  Not since the Black Death carried off a third of Europe in the 14th century has there been a graver threat to the survival of Western civilization.
[02:37:33.911 --> 02:37:38.793]  The new hedonism seems unable to give people a reason to go on living.
[02:37:38.793 --> 02:37:41.094]  Its earliest fruits appear to be poisonous.
[02:37:41.894 --> 02:37:51.027]  Will this new, quote, liberating culture that our young have so enthusiastically embraced prove the deadliest carcinogen of them all?
[02:37:51.027 --> 02:37:56.636]  And if the West is in the grip of a culture of death, as the Pope contends, and the statistics seem to show,
[02:37:57.677 --> 02:38:03.302]  Is Western civilization about to follow Lenin's empire to the same and glorious end?
[02:38:03.302 --> 02:38:09.048]  These ideas have made Western elites apparently indifferent to the death of their civilization.
[02:38:09.048 --> 02:38:18.257]  They do not seem to care if the end of the West comes by depopulation, by a surrender of nationhood, or by drowning in waves of third world immigration.
[02:38:18.257 --> 02:38:19.738]  Now that all the Western empires are...
[02:38:22.571 --> 02:38:25.193]  And again, that's part of one of these great reports.
[02:38:25.193 --> 02:38:31.099]  We've got a whole bunch of these that are just really impressive and amazing that are up on the site.
[02:38:31.099 --> 02:38:34.662]  I was going to play all of that report, but we had a computer glitch.
[02:38:34.662 --> 02:38:40.087]  And you know, that's why it's just best that you go get these reports for yourself.
[02:38:40.087 --> 02:38:48.235]  But very, very impressed by how calm and focused this individual is, because I wish I was like that.
[02:38:49.977 --> 02:38:51.978]  I wish I was like that myself.
[02:38:51.978 --> 02:38:56.119]  And so, just whenever, we'll just go ahead and play the next report.
[02:38:56.119 --> 02:39:00.961]  InfoWars poster contest, Al Gore lied, by Thomas Siska from Austin, Texas.
[02:39:00.961 --> 02:39:02.482]  I think we have that one.
[02:39:02.482 --> 02:39:02.982]  So here it is.
[02:39:27.742 --> 02:39:29.543]  Downtown Austin, Texas.
[02:39:29.543 --> 02:39:31.665]  We have quite the poster board.
[02:39:31.665 --> 02:39:37.929]  It's a global warming poster featuring a very adorable polar bear.
[02:39:37.929 --> 02:39:39.030]  We're going to go have some fun.
[02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:08.455]  Al Gore, you lied about the polar bears.
[02:40:08.455 --> 02:40:13.899]  Al Gore, you lied about the polar bears.
[02:40:13.899 --> 02:40:17.402]  They're alright.
[02:40:17.402 --> 02:40:20.604]  They're doing just fine.
[02:40:20.604 --> 02:40:21.165]  Freezing.
[02:40:21.963 --> 02:40:29.126]  It's getting a little cold, but we're doing alright.
[02:40:29.126 --> 02:40:35.849]  We're doing alright.
[02:40:35.849 --> 02:40:37.070]  Thank you.
[02:40:47.993 --> 02:40:50.915]  I'd like a crispy taco, please.
[02:40:50.915 --> 02:40:53.998]  So we're here at Tyson's Tacos in Austin, Texas.
[02:40:53.998 --> 02:40:56.960]  I just performed a song about the polar bears.
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:40:58.622]  Got a free taco for it.
[02:40:58.622 --> 02:41:01.644]  And now you can see the posters in the background.
[02:41:34.862 --> 02:41:38.485]  Here at the Council of Foreign Relations.
[02:41:38.485 --> 02:41:40.186]  My man.
[02:41:40.186 --> 02:41:41.747]  Door guy.
[02:41:41.747 --> 02:41:48.772]  Lots of famous globalists coming in, coming out.
[02:41:48.772 --> 02:41:50.834]  Trying to kill me.
[02:41:50.834 --> 02:41:54.076]  But, really no good posting place.
[02:41:54.076 --> 02:41:56.338]  Except maybe right here.
[02:41:56.338 --> 02:41:57.199]  That's so dope.
[02:42:06.232 --> 02:42:10.375]  You mind taking a video of me real quick?
[02:42:10.375 --> 02:42:18.781]  I'm doing a contest.
[02:42:18.781 --> 02:42:24.985]  I don't want to make you late.
[02:42:24.985 --> 02:42:25.846]  Thank you.
[02:42:25.846 --> 02:42:27.006]  Have a nice day.
[02:42:27.006 --> 02:42:28.648]  68 CFR.
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:40.607]  Hopefully the Ghost of Rockefeller will distribute it, but a lot of people coming in, a lot of students.
[02:42:40.607 --> 02:42:42.308]  Hunter College.
[02:42:42.308 --> 02:42:43.269]  Park Ave, lovely day.
[02:42:43.269 --> 02:42:50.476]  How are you Alex?
[02:42:50.476 --> 02:42:53.960]  I don't know, but I think it needs a...
[02:42:55.034 --> 02:42:56.896]  They've not shut down our speech!
[02:42:56.896 --> 02:43:02.403]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[02:43:02.403 --> 02:43:09.912]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[02:43:09.912 --> 02:43:11.233]  Are you coming back?
[02:43:11.233 --> 02:43:12.374]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[02:43:12.975 --> 02:43:14.336]  We're at Newshorse.com.
[02:43:14.336 --> 02:43:16.598]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[02:43:16.598 --> 02:43:18.600]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:23.345]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[02:43:23.345 --> 02:43:25.607]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[02:43:25.607 --> 02:43:28.890]  InfoWars.com, man!
[02:43:28.890 --> 02:43:29.230]  Woo!
[02:43:31.957 --> 02:43:36.542]  InfoWars.com, because that's most people out here don't know about InfoWars.com.
[02:43:36.542 --> 02:43:39.565]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:43:39.565 --> 02:43:41.487]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[02:43:41.487 --> 02:43:44.990]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:47.733]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[02:43:47.733 --> 02:43:49.835]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:43:49.835 --> 02:43:51.116]  That's where they find it.
[02:43:51.116 --> 02:43:52.838]  You know, there's things called websites.
[02:43:52.838 --> 02:43:53.419]  They just go there.
[02:43:55.678 --> 02:43:59.844]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:43:59.844 --> 02:44:10.257]  So the Infowars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[02:44:10.257 --> 02:44:13.461]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale of
[02:44:13.581 --> 02:44:13.841]  I'm good.
[02:44:29.699 --> 02:44:47.450]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[02:44:47.450 --> 02:44:54.154]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[02:44:57.951 --> 02:44:59.456]  Okay, it's true.
[02:44:59.456 --> 02:45:01.203]  I stayed up late last night, so I had half an hour.
[02:45:54.912 --> 02:45:57.913]  And get the fish oil.
[02:45:57.913 --> 02:45:59.073]  InfoWars.
[02:45:59.073 --> 02:46:02.554]  The most banned network in the world.
[02:46:02.554 --> 02:46:04.314]  We have a new super special.
[02:46:04.314 --> 02:46:06.895]  It's on everything with force in its name.
[02:46:06.895 --> 02:46:12.356]  The new already best-selling Space Force America's Back awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[02:46:12.356 --> 02:46:13.256]  It's gonna be a hit shirt now.
[02:46:13.256 --> 02:46:13.956]  I hope you get it.
[02:46:13.956 --> 02:46:15.216]  Sports broadcast spreads the word.
[02:46:15.216 --> 02:46:16.317]  It's a great conversation piece.
[02:46:16.317 --> 02:46:16.497]  It's 33% off.
[02:46:17.677 --> 02:46:19.779]  We sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.
[02:46:19.779 --> 02:46:22.521]  All the other Force products, it's all 50% off.
[02:46:22.521 --> 02:46:25.163]  ENA Force Plus, that is such a huge deal.
[02:46:25.163 --> 02:46:29.707]  That is the best GoQ10, PQQ system, just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[02:46:29.707 --> 02:46:31.888]  50% off, nobody gets close to that price.
[02:46:31.888 --> 02:46:33.269]  Rain Force Plus, amazing.
[02:46:33.269 --> 02:46:37.593]  Turbo Force, which is just tearing our energy clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[02:46:37.593 --> 02:46:39.595]  Ultimate Female Force is incredible as well.
[02:46:39.595 --> 02:46:41.276]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[02:46:41.496 --> 02:46:43.237]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:07.805 --> 02:47:08.966]  Big Brother.
[02:47:08.966 --> 02:47:10.747]  Mainstream media.
[02:47:10.747 --> 02:47:12.648]  Government cover-ups.
[02:47:12.648 --> 02:47:14.329]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:47:14.329 --> 02:47:15.990]  Well, so does he.
[02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:20.973]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:20.973 --> 02:47:25.795]  And I still haven't done anything wrong!
[02:47:25.795 --> 02:47:29.898]  What can I do to get through to these people?
[02:47:29.898 --> 02:47:32.519]  I'm gonna do the stupid challenge!
[02:47:35.222 --> 02:47:36.883]  That's right, Mr. Stardom.
[02:47:36.883 --> 02:47:44.345]  We're gonna go out and we're gonna put these all over the place.
[02:47:44.345 --> 02:47:48.467]  There it is, there it is.
[02:47:48.467 --> 02:47:51.108]  We're here, right in front of Starbucks.
[02:47:51.108 --> 02:47:54.109]  See, it's right here.
[02:47:54.109 --> 02:47:56.850]  See, it's right here.
[02:47:56.850 --> 02:47:58.311]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong.
[02:47:58.311 --> 02:47:59.351]  We gotta let them know.
[02:48:01.265 --> 02:48:02.946]  Here we go!
[02:48:02.946 --> 02:48:04.988]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong!
[02:48:04.988 --> 02:48:06.570]  Let's do this, man!
[02:48:06.570 --> 02:48:07.811]  Before we get a ticket!
[02:48:07.811 --> 02:48:09.312]  Here comes police!
[02:48:09.312 --> 02:48:09.612]  Police!
[02:48:09.612 --> 02:48:10.453]  Oh, it's coming!
[02:48:10.453 --> 02:48:11.694]  It's coming!
[02:48:11.694 --> 02:48:15.618]  Here I come!
[02:48:15.618 --> 02:48:16.719]  Yeah!
[02:48:16.719 --> 02:48:18.701]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong!
[02:48:18.701 --> 02:48:19.061]  Yeah!
[02:48:19.061 --> 02:48:23.024]  Hey, I just had some good old Christian chicken!
[02:48:23.024 --> 02:48:25.547]  I'm about to go let them know!
[02:48:25.547 --> 02:48:26.768]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong!
[02:48:31.903 --> 02:48:32.723]  Right here!
[02:48:32.723 --> 02:48:33.003]  Ah!
[02:48:33.003 --> 02:48:33.604]  Ah!
[02:48:33.604 --> 02:48:34.124]  Yeah!
[02:48:34.124 --> 02:48:36.385]  Alex Jones, ain't nothing wrong!
[02:48:36.385 --> 02:48:39.646]  You're live at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Stadium!
[02:48:39.646 --> 02:48:42.967]  And I still haven't done anything wrong!
[02:48:42.967 --> 02:48:44.947]  Ah!
[02:48:44.947 --> 02:48:51.790]  And I still haven't done anything wrong!
[02:48:51.790 --> 02:48:53.390]  Ah!
[02:48:53.390 --> 02:48:56.971]  And I still haven't done anything wrong!
[02:48:56.971 --> 02:48:57.131]  Ah!
[02:48:57.131 --> 02:48:59.512]  Right here.
[02:48:59.512 --> 02:49:01.173]  Right here.
[02:49:04.048 --> 02:49:05.809]  Let's go!
[02:49:05.809 --> 02:49:12.452]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong, Tampa Bay!
[02:49:12.452 --> 02:49:17.014]  You know, vaccines have side effects that kill thousands a year.
[02:49:17.014 --> 02:49:24.858]  Vaccines are not tested for safety, and vaccine makers are not liable for the people they injure.
[02:49:24.858 --> 02:49:27.600]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:38.224]  Sir, did you know that vaccines have side effects that kill thousands a year?
[02:49:38.224 --> 02:49:39.545]  Vaccines are not safe.
[02:49:39.545 --> 02:49:41.807]  They're tested for safety and they're not.
[02:49:41.807 --> 02:49:43.569]  People think that.
[02:49:43.569 --> 02:49:46.251]  Vaccine makers are not liable for the people they injure.
[02:49:46.251 --> 02:49:47.472]  Did you know that, sir?
[02:49:47.472 --> 02:49:49.214]  Infowars.com.
[02:49:49.214 --> 02:49:49.794]  Thank you, sir.
[02:49:49.794 --> 02:49:53.798]  We're going to put this right here for you.
[02:49:53.798 --> 02:49:55.900]  That way everybody can see it.
[02:49:55.900 --> 02:49:56.801]  Right there!
[02:49:56.801 --> 02:49:59.603]  Because I'm angry!
[02:50:01.109 --> 02:50:04.651]  I don't know where... We're here live, reporting Tampa, Florida.
[02:50:04.651 --> 02:50:08.132]  I don't know where this microphone came from, but Alex Jones did nothing wrong.
[02:50:08.132 --> 02:50:08.813]  Let's go!
[02:50:08.813 --> 02:50:14.395]  We're here, Tampa, Florida.
[02:50:14.395 --> 02:50:14.975]  Ah!
[02:50:14.975 --> 02:50:17.397]  I got something to say.
[02:50:17.397 --> 02:50:17.997]  I'm angry.
[02:50:17.997 --> 02:50:22.819]  I've had enough of these people.
[02:50:22.819 --> 02:50:25.861]  They're a bunch of Christian murdering scrums.
[02:50:25.861 --> 02:50:28.562]  Running giant death tracks and keeping babies alive.
[02:50:30.763 --> 02:50:32.304]  Sellin' their body parts.
[02:50:32.304 --> 02:50:34.124]  Hey, put it right here.
[02:50:34.124 --> 02:50:37.166]  We're in the corner of Delmaria.
[02:50:37.166 --> 02:50:40.987]  I'm not gonna tell you.
[02:50:40.987 --> 02:50:45.429]  Put it right here.
[02:50:45.429 --> 02:50:47.149]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong!
[02:50:47.149 --> 02:50:48.190]  This is what we're here for!
[02:50:48.190 --> 02:50:49.690]  Infowars.com!
[02:50:49.690 --> 02:50:50.431]  Yeah!
[02:50:50.431 --> 02:50:52.492]  And I still haven't done anything wrong!
[02:51:07.461 --> 02:51:10.585]  Attention to all conservative comrades.
[02:51:10.585 --> 02:51:12.347]  Dude, now let me stop you right there.
[02:51:12.347 --> 02:51:14.790]  It's gonna be a hard pass.
[02:51:14.790 --> 02:51:22.518]  The deep state has foiled our genius plot to give barely any money to Facebook for advertising.
[02:51:22.518 --> 02:51:24.601]  Even though Obama said it was cool.
[02:51:25.905 --> 02:51:33.113]  And now they have banned our greatest ally, Alex Jones, for like the fifth time.
[02:51:33.113 --> 02:51:37.177]  We honestly didn't even know he was still on there.
[02:51:37.177 --> 02:51:38.038]  Greatest ally?
[02:51:38.038 --> 02:51:39.539]  What are you talking about?
[02:51:40.345 --> 02:51:43.427]  Wait, did Hillary Clinton put you up to this?
[02:51:43.427 --> 02:51:48.091]  You'd think we would prefer the Hillary Clinton and the Easy Arrhenia.
[02:51:48.091 --> 02:51:51.193]  But no, we prefer Z Donald Trump.
[02:51:51.193 --> 02:51:54.376]  For some reason, I don't know.
[02:51:54.376 --> 02:51:57.478]  Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.
[02:51:57.478 --> 02:52:01.101]  But more importantly, these big tech authoritarians?
[02:52:01.961 --> 02:52:02.682]  Oh, bully!
[02:52:02.682 --> 02:52:07.545]  They do not like the Donald Trump and they really don't like his supporters.
[02:52:07.545 --> 02:52:15.689]  It's so extreme now that they're even banning Jews after applying vague straw man labels to them.
[02:52:15.689 --> 02:52:17.651]  Call me crazy, but what are they doing?
[02:52:17.651 --> 02:52:20.993]  I want to know what people are actually going to do!
[02:52:20.993 --> 02:52:22.894]  My life is ruined!
[02:52:22.894 --> 02:52:26.336]  Does anybody understand how ruined my life is?
[02:52:26.596 --> 02:52:31.498]  They're even banning 14-year-old women for being too hilarious.
[02:52:31.498 --> 02:52:35.279]  Just some of the journalists finding, you know, personal info, it's sort of scary.
[02:52:35.279 --> 02:52:36.980]  Like, is somebody going to show up at your house?
[02:52:36.980 --> 02:52:38.400]  Are you going to get swatted?
[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:42.502]  You know, what are they willing to go through to take down somebody like me?
[02:52:42.502 --> 02:52:48.224]  Democrats are even going after people's banking just for their political ideology.
[02:52:48.766 --> 02:52:50.247]  What?
[02:52:50.247 --> 02:52:52.789]  Those are literal Nazi backpacks.
[02:52:52.789 --> 02:52:57.112]  I was recently, I was banned on Tuesday from Instagram.
[02:52:57.112 --> 02:52:58.954]  I had a private account.
[02:52:58.954 --> 02:53:01.056]  They still banned me.
[02:53:01.056 --> 02:53:06.780]  I also was banned from Chase WePay to sell tour tickets.
[02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:12.024]  Bro, great clips and all, but I understood about four of those words that you said.
[02:53:12.024 --> 02:53:15.827]  14-year-old Wymans, why do you have an Italian accent?
[02:53:16.755 --> 02:53:19.371]  Wait, is this entrapment?
[02:53:20.831 --> 02:53:21.631]  John Brennan?
[02:53:21.631 --> 02:53:22.692]  Is that you?
[02:53:22.692 --> 02:53:33.337]  In this time of internet censorship, we must stride boldly forward to the next phase of our operation to... make America great again?
[02:53:33.337 --> 02:53:37.339]  It... it doesn't really make a lot of sense.
[02:53:37.339 --> 02:53:38.219]  Exactly.
[02:53:38.219 --> 02:53:42.041]  And take that Super Mario accent with you on the way out.
[02:53:42.041 --> 02:53:43.441]  Gon' get.
[02:53:43.441 --> 02:53:48.104]  It is time to mobilize our forces and peacefully hit the streets?
[02:53:49.324 --> 02:53:53.625]  With our pro-liberty propaganda?
[02:53:53.625 --> 02:53:56.126]  Am I reading this script correctly?
[02:53:56.126 --> 02:53:58.346]  Pro-liberty?
[02:53:58.346 --> 02:54:00.586]  No thanks?
[02:54:00.586 --> 02:54:02.747]  Maybe just a little bit of thanks?
[02:54:02.747 --> 02:54:03.527]  Wait, hold on.
[02:54:03.527 --> 02:54:03.947]  Shut up.
[02:54:03.947 --> 02:54:05.227]  I'm actually listening now.
[02:54:05.227 --> 02:54:12.029]  You're saying, put up posters in the real world since we're banned everywhere in the digital world.
[02:54:13.083 --> 02:54:21.105]  I mean, I am still waiting for those community guideline strikes to expire, so... Duh!
[02:54:21.105 --> 02:54:24.987]  The censorship is here, and who will rise up?
[02:54:24.987 --> 02:54:27.307]  It's actually quite easy.
[02:54:27.307 --> 02:54:42.472]  All you gotta do is print out some pre-made posters, take a video and you hang them up, and then just email a link to that video to contest at infowares.com by Monday, June 10th, midnight central time.
[02:54:44.753 --> 02:54:46.514]  It's so very easy!
[02:54:46.514 --> 02:54:47.994]  Mamma mia!
[02:54:47.994 --> 02:54:52.795]  But most importantly, whatever you do, don't make it too good.
[02:54:52.795 --> 02:54:57.457]  Vladimir really needs that $5,000 first place prize.
[02:54:57.457 --> 02:55:00.357]  Or, tout bien, buy more costumes.
[02:55:00.357 --> 02:55:02.458]  Axes aren't cheap anymore, you know?
[02:55:02.458 --> 02:55:04.178]  But who will win $1,000 for second place?
[02:55:04.178 --> 02:55:05.119]  Or $500 for third?
[02:55:05.119 --> 02:55:05.779]  Will it be you?
[02:55:05.779 --> 02:55:06.699]  C-conservative comrade,
[02:55:13.982 --> 02:55:16.005]  I was... I was kind of talking to you.
[02:55:16.005 --> 02:55:16.846]  Hello?
[02:55:16.846 --> 02:55:20.330]  Sorry, now I'm all embarrassed.
[02:55:20.330 --> 02:55:22.933]  I'm... I'm not leaving though.
[02:55:22.933 --> 02:55:24.455]  No, I'm not... Oh, I'll just sit here.
[02:55:29.224 --> 02:55:35.750]  Alright, I am here for the Info Wars contest to hang a sign or poster with their website.
[02:55:35.750 --> 02:55:37.191]  I'm doing it a little bit different here.
[02:55:37.191 --> 02:55:38.492]  I'm in Flint, Michigan.
[02:55:38.492 --> 02:55:42.516]  What we have here is the block, or as some people call it, the rock.
[02:55:42.516 --> 02:55:45.018]  I've always called it the rock.
[02:55:45.018 --> 02:55:49.462]  And the city gave us permission a long time ago to paint this however we want.
[02:55:49.462 --> 02:55:51.764]  Obviously just keep obscene stuff off it.
[02:55:51.764 --> 02:55:55.427]  So there's no vandalism or any illegal activity or any worries like that here.
[02:55:55.427 --> 02:55:55.847]  It's 100% legal.
[02:55:57.709 --> 02:56:02.314]  Um, I'm right on Camembert Road.
[02:56:02.314 --> 02:56:06.019]  I just got the initial coat of paint.
[02:56:06.019 --> 02:56:07.621]  Figured out how to do it better.
[02:56:07.621 --> 02:56:15.790]  I was looking at Polar's poster, as they say on here, and they said, video yourself doing it, so this will be me videoing myself doing just that.
[02:56:57.620 --> 02:57:01.702]  I've been noticing a lot of signs going up around town.
[02:57:01.702 --> 02:57:04.243]  Unapproved signs.
[02:57:04.243 --> 02:57:09.986]  We here in Erstopia take these things very, very seriously.
[02:57:12.557 --> 02:57:16.645]  That's why I'm here as a representative of the Thought Police.
[02:57:16.645 --> 02:57:22.175]  To let you know what sort of thoughts you are and aren't allowed to have.
[02:57:22.175 --> 02:57:22.516]  Thought 1!
[02:57:23.877 --> 02:57:25.138]  Oh boy!
[02:57:25.138 --> 02:57:29.682]  That's an instant one week suspension.
[02:57:29.682 --> 02:57:32.964]  Oh, what's this about free speech?
[02:57:32.964 --> 02:57:34.405]  Not in Erstofia.
[02:57:34.405 --> 02:57:37.648]  That's one month in the brig!
[02:57:37.648 --> 02:57:38.628]  This right here?
[02:57:38.628 --> 02:57:44.353]  Probably one of the best examples of what'll get you sent to the Gulag to re-educate.
[02:57:47.734 --> 02:57:57.136]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.

[02:59:13.151 --> 02:59:14.132]  We're good to go.
[02:59:49.273 --> 03:00:00.035]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.035 --> 03:00:06.857]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.857 --> 03:00:10.458]  And now, your host, Nick Begich.
[03:00:14.193 --> 03:00:18.815]  And welcome to this fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:18.815 --> 03:00:20.776]  And I'm sitting in for Alex.
[03:00:20.776 --> 03:00:27.019]  You know, there's always a lot of news and the guys cover it.
[03:00:27.019 --> 03:00:30.201]  Alex covers it really extraordinarily well.
[03:00:30.201 --> 03:00:37.504]  And, you know, the things I want to talk about a little bit today, maybe amplify some of this free speech discussion.
[03:00:37.504 --> 03:00:39.225]  And I'm going to kind of roll back
[03:00:40.232 --> 03:00:43.554]  And it sort of reshaped this a little bit.
[03:00:43.554 --> 03:00:53.421]  You know, when I first started doing this work years ago, the main emphasis for me was really military technology, how they were being applied.
[03:00:53.421 --> 03:00:59.165]  And then that led to privacy related technologies, another look at all of that.
[03:00:59.905 --> 03:01:03.708]  And a number of issues sort of came to the front.
[03:01:03.708 --> 03:01:09.032]  Now this was the middle 1990s, even the early 1990s.
[03:01:09.032 --> 03:01:21.820]  And so we started to see, my colleagues and I, trends that were taking us really rapidly in a direction that would present probably the biggest challenges for freedom and liberty.
[03:01:21.820 --> 03:01:23.662]  So I started writing and talking about
[03:01:24.482 --> 03:01:48.158]  The technocracy and the changes that were taking place within our culture and really the reshaping of culture, not based so much on what sprang from populations, but what media brought to us and how it sort of gently and then more radically began to shape the way people see the world.
[03:01:49.279 --> 03:02:05.170]  When you think about this, as things got more and more mechanized, more and more automated, it provided a lot of information, gave us access to a lot, but at the same time, every window that opened went both ways.
[03:02:05.170 --> 03:02:07.651]  And this is what got missed in the shuffle.
[03:02:07.651 --> 03:02:13.475]  As information opened in the world, it also opened in the direction of you personally.
[03:02:14.373 --> 03:02:27.657]  And so a lot of discussion about privacy and speech and the basic fundamentals, the building blocks of democratic republics like ours.
[03:02:27.657 --> 03:02:38.940]  When these start to be silenced by all the different methods, whether it's by political speech, you know, that was the first real wave, you know, what was not nice to say.
[03:02:39.860 --> 03:02:44.124]  And then what is criminally not nice to say what became hate speech.
[03:02:44.124 --> 03:02:49.529]  And that continues to be amplified across the population.
[03:02:49.529 --> 03:02:54.233]  So you think about speech as the first sort of attack and takeaway.
[03:02:54.233 --> 03:02:58.757]  Because if you can't have open discussion, then it's easier to do the next thing.
[03:02:58.757 --> 03:03:02.220]  You know, take away your Second Amendment rights as an example.
[03:03:02.220 --> 03:03:04.783]  If you can't talk about it and the people that are talking
[03:03:05.723 --> 03:03:12.587]  about this in a way that is constitutional, get silenced, then what can you say?
[03:03:12.587 --> 03:03:17.030]  All the information in the world won't give you the opportunity to speak your truth.
[03:03:17.030 --> 03:03:23.454]  And so this is the impact, excuse me, on democracy.
[03:03:23.454 --> 03:03:29.337]  That's actually taking us down a path that's much different than the one we're currently on.
[03:03:30.066 --> 03:03:41.091]  And again, we need to kind of rethink in the 21st century how technologies play against what we're seeing play out in the daily news.
[03:03:41.091 --> 03:03:43.613]  And the news feeds are interesting.
[03:03:43.613 --> 03:03:57.099]  You know, when you look at sort of how it's being shaped, CNN continuing to drop in the polls because people recognize it's becoming more of a contest of who's the best editorial showman.
[03:03:57.970 --> 03:04:09.915]  As opposed to delivering really useful information within the context of a public debate, invigorating the public debate, if I might say, with the facts rather than the opinion.
[03:04:09.915 --> 03:04:13.957]  And we see that across the media today.
[03:04:13.957 --> 03:04:17.098]  But it's not just about speech, it's also about privacy.
[03:04:17.722 --> 03:04:34.533]  Because as we look at the news and as we select the data feeds that we're interested in, we also begin to reveal a profile of us ourselves individually, which is then utilized by Big Tech and their, with their cooperation, Big Government.
[03:04:34.533 --> 03:04:38.115]  We're going to talk more about this in the remaining segments of this hour.
[03:04:38.115 --> 03:04:40.817]  Take a look at infowarestore.com.
[03:04:40.817 --> 03:04:45.000]  That's how we're supported and we appreciate you tuning in today, this Friday afternoon.

[03:06:14.994 --> 03:06:25.619]  And welcome back on this Friday afternoon in most countries, still a bit before noon here in Alaska, where I'm broadcasting today in the background.
[03:06:25.619 --> 03:06:30.301]  If you see it, that's one of the scenes from my part of the world.
[03:06:30.301 --> 03:06:31.882]  You know, when you think about
[03:06:32.478 --> 03:06:47.626]  The things that are happening right now, the idea of profiling, if you will, what we're trying to speaking to just before the break was this idea of gathering data, the two way sort of window and how the data is used and manipulated.
[03:06:47.626 --> 03:06:49.387]  You know, this is really.
[03:06:50.925 --> 03:07:02.515]  The reshaping so that what you see in advertising in your social media, what you see coming at you, literally, is based on what you provide an information.
[03:07:02.515 --> 03:07:05.998]  And this is what fundamentally probably needs to be protected.
[03:07:05.998 --> 03:07:06.799]  Now, think back.
[03:07:06.799 --> 03:07:14.946]  If you go back to the 1990s, there was a program, Total Awareness, and it was a Pentagon program, and they wanted to really see the public.
[03:07:15.774 --> 03:07:29.086]  You know, every minute detail from facial recognition to your whole set of preferences in life, everything about you that you could gather was the sort of the picture and using the Internet to do it.
[03:07:29.668 --> 03:07:39.953]  Well, that kind of got shut down, sort of, but then what it's called Total Information Awareness for those that are looking at the thing on the video feed on this program.
[03:07:39.953 --> 03:07:46.737]  But here's the thing that about that that's important is what they supposedly didn't do.
[03:07:46.737 --> 03:07:54.701]  It switched over to more of a terrorism look, but they collect all the data and then they made their deal with big tech.
[03:07:55.538 --> 03:08:00.040]  And Big Tech had the same kind of programming need, if you will.
[03:08:00.040 --> 03:08:15.305]  But their need was for the commercial extraction of the data so they could use it to go sell that data to other commercial enterprises that would sell you at a higher rate and be more successful in shaping, you know, sort of what you buy and your buying pattern.
[03:08:15.305 --> 03:08:16.786]  I'm understanding a lot about you.
[03:08:17.324 --> 03:08:22.888]  Well, this stuff morphed into political manipulation as well.
[03:08:22.888 --> 03:08:38.038]  And in fact, all of this, Jim Roderick, late Jim Roderick and I spoke about back in a book we wrote now almost 20 years ago called Earthrise and the Revolution, which still is pertinent in terms of where we are today.
[03:08:38.038 --> 03:08:43.281]  And it was more of a forecast based on 650 source documents.
[03:08:43.281 --> 03:08:46.804]  And that book is available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:08:47.544 --> 03:08:48.225]  We're good to go.
[03:09:03.843 --> 03:09:23.394]  The misapplication, which has not been adequately safeguarded, and this is the problem, is as our technologies have emerged and blossomed in the 21st century and moving in to this next hundred years, the platform is changing.
[03:09:23.394 --> 03:09:26.895]  Now, let me tell you what that means from a standpoint of technology.
[03:09:26.895 --> 03:09:31.518]  From the invention of the wheel to where we are at this moment, as we take this breath,
[03:09:32.191 --> 03:09:38.876]  In 10 months, all the technology that's been developed in that branch of time is going to double.
[03:09:38.876 --> 03:09:40.858]  And that's the window going forward.
[03:09:40.858 --> 03:09:43.440]  That's how fast everything is moving.
[03:09:43.440 --> 03:09:45.401]  Faster than anyone can keep up.
[03:09:45.401 --> 03:09:54.288]  And then the information gathered in those technologies is applied for commercial, political, and governmental reasons.
[03:09:54.288 --> 03:09:55.509]  If you don't think so,
[03:09:57.515 --> 03:10:00.797]  You've been sleeping under a rock.
[03:10:00.797 --> 03:10:13.064]  Now what's happening in all of this, as you think about it, is the safeguards for the very fundamental values that this program and others talk about are lost sort of in the shuffle.
[03:10:13.064 --> 03:10:18.167]  The right privacy is no longer about your front door.
[03:10:18.167 --> 03:10:20.888]  And I've said this many times in this way.
[03:10:20.888 --> 03:10:23.850]  It is your digital doorway that has been kicked in.
[03:10:25.186 --> 03:10:33.571]  It's been kicked in by a technocracy, a union of big corporations as well as governments.
[03:10:33.571 --> 03:10:46.778]  And these big corporations, interestingly enough today, are the information technology, marketing technologies, the Googles, the Amazons, the Facebooks.
[03:10:46.778 --> 03:10:48.739]  And they are actually controlling
[03:10:49.319 --> 03:10:57.683]  And manipulating the political speech in favor of the political views of the owners of those companies as they're represented by their CEOs.
[03:10:57.683 --> 03:11:04.687]  And it's a big shift, you know, because a lot of economic power was traditionally held by the right.
[03:11:04.687 --> 03:11:13.611]  We never really thought much about big economic power held by the left, because traditionally Democrats in the United States were about working people.
[03:11:14.431 --> 03:11:19.154]  And Republicans were about big business, but that's all upside down anymore.
[03:11:19.154 --> 03:11:20.495]  It doesn't even apply anymore.
[03:11:20.495 --> 03:11:22.416]  It's all upside down.
[03:11:22.416 --> 03:11:25.658]  Value and dollars and income and billionaires don't matter.
[03:11:25.658 --> 03:11:29.620]  You're in both parties everywhere, furthering political interest.
[03:11:29.620 --> 03:11:40.607]  And it just makes it more obvious when you see it on the left, because the mechanism they happen to control aren't like big steel or oil or gas.
[03:11:40.607 --> 03:11:43.669]  It's the very communications that talk about all those things.
[03:11:44.605 --> 03:11:47.106]  And everything else under the sun.
[03:11:47.106 --> 03:11:54.228]  And then to restrict commercial transactions through PayPal and other organizations.
[03:11:54.228 --> 03:11:55.448]  Think about this.
[03:11:55.448 --> 03:11:57.548]  Is this the mark?
[03:11:57.548 --> 03:12:09.972]  Is this when buying and selling is regulated by those that conform to political speak and cultural speak evolved by think tanks of morons who just want to manipulate us?
[03:12:12.245 --> 03:12:17.226]  And I say spiritually moronic because intellectually they're high-powered horsepower.
[03:12:17.226 --> 03:12:19.207]  I don't think they're not.
[03:12:19.207 --> 03:12:23.888]  But spiritually they're bankrupt and they know it.
[03:12:23.888 --> 03:12:36.811]  Because the countermeasures is that awakening that's coming and is here now for those that have paid attention to what's going on in the world in the 21st century.
[03:12:36.811 --> 03:12:39.072]  And now is a very different time because as
[03:12:40.552 --> 03:12:52.544]  You look at what's being done materially, externally in the world, it's really a reflection internally of also what's happening within us.
[03:12:52.544 --> 03:12:58.530]  You know, usually when you think about these things, there's two extremes, both sides of the equation.
[03:12:58.530 --> 03:12:59.251]  You know, there's the
[03:13:01.042 --> 03:13:09.866]  A side of the equation that says, oh, people are just drones, taxpayers, consumers, whatever title they want to give you.
[03:13:09.866 --> 03:13:14.888]  I want to say to everyone listening to this broadcast, you are not that.
[03:13:14.888 --> 03:13:16.509]  You can reflect some of those things.
[03:13:16.509 --> 03:13:26.674]  Certainly you're a consumer at times, you're a taxpayer at times, you're a parent at times, you're a friend at times, you're all those things at times, but you are
[03:13:28.183 --> 03:13:30.184]  A human being, fundamentally.
[03:13:30.184 --> 03:13:34.427]  And those things that I just referenced are things that you do.
[03:13:34.427 --> 03:13:38.350]  You are a parent sometimes, you are a friend sometimes, you're a taxpayer sometimes.
[03:13:38.350 --> 03:13:46.675]  These things that you do are wrapped around your experiential living in the world that we experience on a day-to-day basis.
[03:13:46.675 --> 03:13:48.697]  That's our physical reality.
[03:13:48.697 --> 03:13:55.261]  But our internal reality, our value systems, that decide how we behave and act in the world,
[03:13:56.895 --> 03:13:59.657]  Is really the corpus of our awareness, right?
[03:13:59.657 --> 03:14:11.105]  This is what motivates us, which moves us through the world in a way that creates a positive change, something that robotics and AI will never have.
[03:14:11.105 --> 03:14:13.026]  But having said that.
[03:14:13.698 --> 03:14:22.943]  The advances in these technologies and what's coming and their ability to rationally reason will be indisputable.
[03:14:22.943 --> 03:14:30.567]  To take huge, massive data sets and interpret those data sets, these machines will be able to do.
[03:14:30.567 --> 03:14:34.269]  But I have news for everyone listening.
[03:14:34.269 --> 03:14:40.392]  The quantum computing that they're aspiring to and quantum computing, just let me give you a quick illustration.
[03:14:41.272 --> 03:14:57.759]  20 years ago the case was you could put everybody on a hand calculator for 60 hours and do what you could do with the whole population of the planet for 60 hours running hand calculations every few seconds.
[03:14:57.759 --> 03:15:02.581]  And a supercomputer of today would do that in a second.
[03:15:02.581 --> 03:15:04.222]  A quantum computer.
[03:15:04.222 --> 03:15:04.982]  Now imagine that.
[03:15:05.586 --> 03:15:13.312]  All those people running those hand calculators all that time for 60 hours, the whole planet, everybody.
[03:15:13.312 --> 03:15:16.554]  And that's what a supercomputer today does in a second.
[03:15:16.554 --> 03:15:21.938]  Think about that supercomputer that I just described running for a trillion years.
[03:15:21.938 --> 03:15:26.821]  A quantum computer will do what that supercomputer does in a trillion years.
[03:15:26.821 --> 03:15:27.402]  It will do it
[03:15:28.584 --> 03:15:29.905]  In one hour.
[03:15:29.905 --> 03:15:39.350]  Which means all encryption goes away, the ability to look at all the data and draw very, very accurate scenarios becomes possible.
[03:15:39.350 --> 03:15:41.231]  Some say we already have one.
[03:15:41.231 --> 03:15:43.993]  Some say we're a few decades away.
[03:15:43.993 --> 03:15:44.853]  We're going to be right back.
[03:15:44.853 --> 03:15:47.074]  We're going to pick it up right after these brief messages.
[03:15:47.074 --> 03:15:49.776]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and we're in the Info War.
[03:15:53.234 --> 03:15:57.117]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[03:17:22.759 --> 03:17:23.980]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:23.980 --> 03:17:27.903]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:27.903 --> 03:17:29.444]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.444 --> 03:17:32.406]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.406 --> 03:17:37.969]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:37.969 --> 03:17:39.170]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:39.170 --> 03:17:42.112]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:42.112 --> 03:17:44.334]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[03:17:54.099 --> 03:17:57.702]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:17:57.702 --> 03:17:59.483]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:17:59.483 --> 03:18:11.533]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:18:11.533 --> 03:18:16.557]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[03:18:17.317 --> 03:18:26.664]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:18:26.664 --> 03:18:31.768]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:18:31.768 --> 03:18:34.390]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[03:18:34.390 --> 03:18:36.111]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:18:36.111 --> 03:18:40.915]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[03:18:41.135 --> 03:18:46.098]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:18:46.098 --> 03:18:48.739]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:18:48.739 --> 03:18:53.442]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:18:54.278 --> 03:18:58.843]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[03:18:58.843 --> 03:19:00.866]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:19:00.866 --> 03:19:01.967]  Good to talk to you.
[03:19:01.967 --> 03:19:06.612]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[03:19:06.612 --> 03:19:08.555]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[03:19:08.555 --> 03:19:13.120]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[03:19:13.380 --> 03:19:19.366]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[03:19:19.366 --> 03:19:20.126]  I appreciate that.
[03:19:20.126 --> 03:19:21.728]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:19:21.728 --> 03:19:22.348]  Tell us about it.
[03:19:22.348 --> 03:19:23.109]  Well, it's really great.
[03:19:23.109 --> 03:19:24.410]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:19:24.410 --> 03:19:24.931]  I take it.
[03:19:24.931 --> 03:19:25.671]  It tastes good.
[03:19:25.671 --> 03:19:27.513]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:19:27.513 --> 03:19:29.475]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:19:29.475 --> 03:19:32.918]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[03:19:32.978 --> 03:19:35.800]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:19:35.800 --> 03:19:37.561]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:19:37.561 --> 03:19:39.642]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:19:39.642 --> 03:19:42.984]  So yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[03:19:42.984 --> 03:19:45.826]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[03:19:45.826 --> 03:19:46.967]  So I'm glad you plugged it.

[03:19:48.048 --> 03:19:49.468]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.488 --> 03:20:16.609]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.609 --> 03:20:18.530]  Because there is a war on.
[03:20:18.530 --> 03:20:20.171]  For your mind.
[03:20:20.171 --> 03:20:26.235]  With Nick Begich.
[03:20:26.235 --> 03:20:28.836]  And welcome back to this fourth hour.
[03:20:28.836 --> 03:20:33.919]  I'm coming to you from, last again, from my home in Anchorage.
[03:20:33.919 --> 03:20:43.285]  And just before the break, I was talking about this kind of way of maybe reshaping some of the debate, alright?
[03:20:44.985 --> 03:20:57.287]  We talk about information, we talk about sort of what the technocracy is doing and its attack on our basic humanity, you know, on who we are because of the way it looks at us.
[03:20:57.287 --> 03:20:59.348]  It makes us into a commodity.
[03:20:59.348 --> 03:21:08.990]  Think about, you know, seven to nine billion people around the planet over the next ten years just being some expendable commodity.
[03:21:08.990 --> 03:21:09.710]  This is how
[03:21:10.778 --> 03:21:22.810]  Much of the population of the world is looked at by many at the very top of the pile of greed, corruption, and craziness.
[03:21:22.810 --> 03:21:26.193]  And not to say that accumulating wealth is bad.
[03:21:26.193 --> 03:21:27.455]  I believe it's a good thing.
[03:21:27.455 --> 03:21:30.257]  You know, it's a way that we sort of keep score on the planet.
[03:21:30.257 --> 03:21:30.678]  We do it.
[03:21:31.238 --> 03:21:51.571]  Responsibly and most of us make our living in a decent way and I think even these big tech companies, you know, great innovation, great ideas, great teams, great people, but misapplication of technology by failing to underlie that experience again on a platform of values.
[03:21:51.571 --> 03:21:52.872]  This is what's been missing.
[03:21:53.853 --> 03:22:00.334]  And yet everyone's looking for it, so when you see the slightest indication of it, people tend to gravitate that way.
[03:22:00.334 --> 03:22:07.276]  That's why certain speakers are jumping out of the woodwork, because they're speaking a truth that resonates with people.
[03:22:07.276 --> 03:22:18.258]  Because everyone, internally, as a human being, when you hear it, it vibrates, it resonates, it sounds a note in you that is unavoidable.
[03:22:18.826 --> 03:22:21.507]  That you can't mistake for something else.
[03:22:21.507 --> 03:22:30.550]  It's that intuitive touch of grace that tells you what is and what is not in your personal interior life.
[03:22:30.550 --> 03:22:42.374]  Now if you shut that down, you don't listen to it, you just keep turning it off, turning it off, it will dull and it will atrophy and you'll become a sociopath, a narcissist, and a sociopath.
[03:22:43.032 --> 03:22:55.577]  Which, incidentally, there's like one or two in five at the very top of CEOs and organizations, including government, that are that.
[03:22:55.577 --> 03:23:02.519]  Because that's what allows them to cut the throat of anyone in their way and jump to the top.
[03:23:02.519 --> 03:23:04.520]  Many of them are sociopaths.
[03:23:04.520 --> 03:23:10.722]  Inability to recognize and display natural, normal human emotions, because they've turned all that off.
[03:23:11.158 --> 03:23:17.602]  Because the feeling side of us is what's stimulated often by our intuitive internal conversation.
[03:23:17.602 --> 03:23:20.904]  And then what we do with that decides how we deal with the world.
[03:23:20.904 --> 03:23:26.948]  Do we deal with the world in anxiety and fear and run around worrying about the sky falling?
[03:23:26.948 --> 03:23:30.050]  Or do we engage life in a more direct,
[03:23:32.621 --> 03:23:53.060]  Where we engage what we see in the world from a platform of recognition of our basic innate values as living souls, as created human beings, as a spirit occupying a carrier or a body or whatever you want to refer to this thing.
[03:23:54.450 --> 03:24:05.435]  But the recognition of that is sort of a foundation for your dialogue in life, sort of changes the way your words project from your mouth, which create the reality around you.
[03:24:05.435 --> 03:24:06.476]  Think about it.
[03:24:06.476 --> 03:24:08.917]  People react to what you say.
[03:24:08.917 --> 03:24:13.179]  You have deep responsibility for what you say and how the information is delivered.
[03:24:13.179 --> 03:24:20.282]  You know, some people are stimulated by all different kinds of conversation to get thinking engaged again.
[03:24:21.015 --> 03:24:23.097]  Thinking is the name of the game.
[03:24:23.097 --> 03:24:30.644]  And so much of the social media and the mainstream media is not about engaging your intellect.
[03:24:30.644 --> 03:24:46.879]  It's about moving the herd, pushing your opinion, pushing who you are, shaping what you think, determining how to best do that based on the information you voluntarily give up every time you engage with an electronic interface into the world.
[03:24:47.714 --> 03:24:57.581]  And anything else you do, because even the fundamental stuff like mail, you know, every return address and address sent is kept by the Postal Service.
[03:24:57.581 --> 03:25:03.426]  And all those linkages create, again, a matrix that describes a lot about us individually.
[03:25:03.426 --> 03:25:07.729]  And this is the ongoing collection of data.
[03:25:07.729 --> 03:25:10.691]  And what does the data mean?
[03:25:10.691 --> 03:25:14.214]  The data makes predictions.
[03:25:14.214 --> 03:25:16.916]  The more you have, the better your ability to predict.
[03:25:17.501 --> 03:25:46.833]  With 3,000 data points, which we all give up, if you're listening to this on any medium at all, I know that you've done that in probably the last month or six weeks even, 3,000 contact points, you have a profile of an individual that's so profound that someone who lives with you for 20 years could, it would take to be able to predict, but more importantly, the computer will predict what you will do at that point better than you yourself
[03:25:48.235 --> 03:25:49.256]  Wow!
[03:25:49.256 --> 03:25:50.737]  Based on just the raw data.
[03:25:50.737 --> 03:26:03.567]  So when you think about AI and computers gathering information, and when we started our work, they were using data warehouses, and they were storing all this data, and everybody was saying, ah, it's worthless, it doesn't mean anything.
[03:26:03.567 --> 03:26:08.711]  Before this segment began, we were talking about quantum computing and the power of that.
[03:26:08.711 --> 03:26:12.975]  And see, this allows you to sort all that data instantly.
[03:26:12.975 --> 03:26:13.275]  Poof!
[03:26:14.801 --> 03:26:29.553]  Just virtually instantly, I mean with so little time involved, and then be able to apply the flow of information, the nudging against each profile of each person individually, and be able to track them through the world.
[03:26:30.143 --> 03:26:38.004]  Because of facial recognition, voice recognition, these basic things that we reported on 20 years ago that are now part of the mainstream.
[03:26:38.004 --> 03:26:41.725]  This is part of the Chinese model of social control.
[03:26:41.725 --> 03:26:44.766]  And this network and people listening to this network are well aware of it.
[03:26:44.766 --> 03:26:51.347]  Facial recognition, biometrics, applied to population control, and then your behavior monitoring.
[03:26:51.347 --> 03:26:59.308]  This is all based on data points from a culture, technologically, that's way different from what we're doing in the West.
[03:26:59.468 --> 03:27:04.873]  We even give more information up in the West than they ever thought about giving up in China.
[03:27:04.873 --> 03:27:08.316]  The differences are overt about it, and here we're covert about it.
[03:27:08.316 --> 03:27:11.559]  It's the same thing, it's just happening a little differently.
[03:27:11.559 --> 03:27:12.320]  Now in the U.S.
[03:27:12.320 --> 03:27:24.871]  they say, oh, but we're not going to get that data without a warrant, and then you've got things like FISA courts where nobody even gets to hear about warrants, and false information is rolled up in front of judges and gets used to subpoena records, and then all that data
[03:27:26.263 --> 03:27:33.366]  You know, secret court, shutting down freedom of speech, big tech, holding our data warehouses hostage.
[03:27:33.366 --> 03:27:45.031]  This is your information, your digital doorway, and the technocracy has already kicked it in, and no one has said a word except these networks.
[03:27:45.031 --> 03:27:53.595]  They represent an alternative view of the media, both from the far left and the far right, and sweeping all the way through the middle, these dialogues has happened.
[03:27:54.366 --> 03:28:19.433]  And have happened, continue to happen, and yet the mainstream continues to push us apart, to separate us, and to create a violent reaction and backlash that's not only unnecessary, it doesn't lend itself to this republic and the principles under which it was founded, which is about our divinity as human souls, our independence, our sovereignty,
[03:28:20.193 --> 03:28:26.798]  The system that has come against us is choking us and strangling this Democratic Republic.
[03:28:26.798 --> 03:28:29.560]  And this is not the only democracy being affected.
[03:28:29.560 --> 03:28:34.964]  That is why you're seeing the backlash around the world from those who are still awake.
[03:28:34.964 --> 03:28:37.907]  And the awakening is happening now.
[03:28:37.907 --> 03:28:39.288]  You're the tip of the spear.
[03:28:39.288 --> 03:28:41.729]  We're doing this together.
[03:28:41.729 --> 03:28:44.211]  Take a look at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:28:44.211 --> 03:28:46.313]  We'll be right back after these brief messages.
[03:28:53.246 --> 03:28:54.768]  Oh, these pains.
[03:28:54.768 --> 03:28:57.290]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[03:28:57.290 --> 03:28:59.112]  I've got to get some relief.
[03:28:59.112 --> 03:29:04.818]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries, or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.

[03:31:54.770 --> 03:32:02.178]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world's history.
[03:32:02.178 --> 03:32:06.463]  This is a digital, AI-enforced, gag order.
[03:32:06.463 --> 03:32:10.167]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or Infowars.com.
[03:32:15.834 --> 03:32:17.535]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[03:32:17.535 --> 03:32:18.755]  This is racketeering.
[03:32:18.755 --> 03:32:19.876]  This is cartels.
[03:32:19.876 --> 03:32:22.277]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[03:32:22.277 --> 03:32:24.158]  We need it now.
[03:32:24.158 --> 03:32:25.858]  You can take on Big Tech.
[03:32:25.858 --> 03:32:34.802]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[03:32:34.802 --> 03:32:42.845]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[03:32:42.845 --> 03:32:43.706]  The way to fight back
[03:32:44.346 --> 03:32:49.169]  It's to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[03:32:49.169 --> 03:32:57.635]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[03:32:57.635 --> 03:33:00.277]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.518 --> 03:33:20.732]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Vagich.
[03:33:20.732 --> 03:33:23.498]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:27.313 --> 03:33:35.342]  And welcome back and I want to thank everyone that supports this network and supports us on the production team.
[03:33:35.342 --> 03:33:44.353]  I got Connor and Kyle and Daria always helping me out when we're on live and I really appreciate them a lot and
[03:33:44.953 --> 03:33:46.515]  I appreciate everyone that listens.
[03:33:46.515 --> 03:33:50.579]  You know, pass these videos on, you know, and remember the contest that's going on.
[03:33:50.579 --> 03:33:55.284]  I thought that was pretty cool before this segment began.
[03:33:55.284 --> 03:33:57.467]  $5,000, you know, putting up signs.
[03:33:57.467 --> 03:33:58.027]  First prize.
[03:33:58.027 --> 03:33:59.369]  I think that's a cool thing.
[03:33:59.369 --> 03:34:04.194]  And that gets the InfoWars out and bypasses the technocracy.
[03:34:04.194 --> 03:34:04.514]  So I think
[03:34:04.514 --> 03:34:06.194]  I think that's a great idea.
[03:34:06.194 --> 03:34:11.875]  You know, I'm like a paper guy and I've been trying to get better about it, but I just can't.
[03:34:11.875 --> 03:34:18.017]  You know, I really, I keep books and they're not in digital form, they're actually printed.
[03:34:18.017 --> 03:34:24.838]  And I keep paper because I think about the digital world and how easy information can come and go and be restricted.
[03:34:24.838 --> 03:34:27.538]  And we're just seeing the very beginning of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:34:27.538 --> 03:34:29.179]  And those who haven't read the book 1984, well,
[03:34:31.266 --> 03:34:33.168]  You're in it.
[03:34:33.168 --> 03:34:39.695]  You all have leading roles, although we don't generally think about it, except 1984 is primitive.
[03:34:39.695 --> 03:34:44.039]  I mean, it's like the primitive version of what we're doing and what's happening to us today.
[03:34:44.039 --> 03:34:49.305]  And as actors in the play of reshaping the way we think,
[03:34:51.272 --> 03:35:01.576]  The InfoWars, you see, the very name InfoWars implies from the very beginning going back 23, 24 years now with Alex.
[03:35:01.576 --> 03:35:14.720]  For me, my statement, my slogan, you know, at the end of my company name was changing the way we see the world because that's what I saw going on and I wanted to make sure we at least kept some focus that was multi-generational.
[03:35:15.340 --> 03:35:21.764]  And, you know, this is my brother Tom's thesis, his master's thesis was on multi-generational history.
[03:35:21.764 --> 03:35:24.746]  One of the degrees he got along the way was one in history.
[03:35:24.746 --> 03:35:31.250]  And, you know, he has a very different perspective on sort of what history brought us to and how we interpret it.
[03:35:32.010 --> 03:35:35.731]  And in my family, we have real liberals.
[03:35:35.731 --> 03:35:37.171]  Tom fits on that end.
[03:35:37.171 --> 03:35:38.872]  And real conservatives.
[03:35:38.872 --> 03:35:40.632]  And my son and I fit on that end.
[03:35:40.632 --> 03:35:43.333]  My oldest son and I. And you know what?
[03:35:43.333 --> 03:35:48.234]  When we get into these discussions, what we're looking for is not necessarily the middle ground.
[03:35:48.234 --> 03:35:50.375]  There's my brother on screen if you're looking.
[03:35:51.356 --> 03:35:57.120]  And he's a state senator, actually, representing downtown Anchoragetown and our state capitol.
[03:35:57.120 --> 03:36:05.386]  And, you know, when you look at the politics, the differences, this brings an invigorated conversation.
[03:36:05.386 --> 03:36:07.928]  That's really lively.
[03:36:07.928 --> 03:36:11.251]  It's not devoid of emotions by any stretch of the imagination.
[03:36:11.251 --> 03:36:13.793]  But a value system underlies that debate.
[03:36:14.398 --> 03:36:20.280]  And it's based on consideration, respect, and accountability, and love, fundamentally.
[03:36:20.280 --> 03:36:25.221]  And the right, the fundamental right to express ourselves respectfully.
[03:36:25.221 --> 03:36:31.103]  Recognizing fundamentally, and we express differently, the divinity in each other.
[03:36:31.103 --> 03:36:33.883]  That level of respect.
[03:36:33.883 --> 03:36:42.906]  That we listen carefully, we engage the debate, and hopefully, and one of the kind of working rules in my family is if you go to the fight, you know, in terms of a debate,
[03:36:43.675 --> 03:36:52.242]  You need to come armed with a set of solutions and make that the focus of your conversation because therein lies the opportunity.
[03:36:52.242 --> 03:36:55.844]  We all recognize problems just come at the solutions differently.
[03:36:55.844 --> 03:36:57.826]  So we fight over the problem existing.
[03:36:57.826 --> 03:36:58.806]  Well, that's kind of crazy.
[03:36:58.806 --> 03:37:00.708]  We all know these problems exist.
[03:37:00.708 --> 03:37:05.672]  So let that go get into the discussion about what are the solution sets for getting the
[03:37:06.372 --> 03:37:10.394]  Propaganda, one-liners, they get us all emotionally charged up.
[03:37:10.394 --> 03:37:19.880]  Because this is what the left and the right are so good at, in terms of organizational structures at the top, representing different groups of elites.
[03:37:19.880 --> 03:37:23.882]  It doesn't matter whether they're Republican elites or Democratic elites.
[03:37:23.882 --> 03:37:25.483]  Why do the elites hate Donald Trump?
[03:37:26.155 --> 03:37:28.377]  Because he wasn't part of the team, you know?
[03:37:28.377 --> 03:37:30.698]  He was kind of this maverick, independent guy.
[03:37:30.698 --> 03:37:38.183]  My oldest son and I voted for Donald Trump and the chagrin of every one of my relatives.
[03:37:38.183 --> 03:37:41.145]  But, you know, my view was we needed a disruptor.
[03:37:41.145 --> 03:37:44.047]  We needed someone that would shake the system and change it.
[03:37:44.047 --> 03:37:48.230]  And think about this in the context of this technocracy.
[03:37:48.230 --> 03:37:55.275]  He has the potential of totally changing it if he's listening to these kinds of broadcasts and recognizing the intrusion that happened in his life.
[03:37:56.181 --> 03:38:24.436]  That he now is aware of how they manipulated information, tapped his phones, infiltrated his life, and they're doing it to every single one of us, every single day, which is why this president, another person who has been hammered by the same technocracy, needs to grab it by the... and move on, and get the thing fixed.
[03:38:25.416 --> 03:38:27.437]  Because it's gone on too long.
[03:38:27.437 --> 03:38:28.258]  It's gone too far.
[03:38:28.258 --> 03:38:30.559]  It's even touched his presence in the United States.
[03:38:30.559 --> 03:38:44.147]  Even our so-called allies, national leaders' phones were tapped by a bureaucracy, a technocracy, that even politicians, many of which are unaware, and many others are complicit.
[03:38:44.147 --> 03:38:46.868]  And why are they cooperating?
[03:38:46.868 --> 03:38:54.953]  Because from Hoover's days and continuing today, through fraternities, organizations, observations,
[03:38:55.851 --> 03:39:06.615]  All the dark secrets are known about all the public players that are out there and they better do what they're told or the rest of the world knows too.
[03:39:06.615 --> 03:39:23.582]  Because there's a whole bunch of wieners out there, there's a whole bunch of Bill and Hillary's out there, there's a bunch of people doing criminal activity out there that's excused and then used because when they hit the political high points of their careers
[03:39:24.529 --> 03:39:26.650]  They do what they're told.
[03:39:26.650 --> 03:39:29.371]  That's the problem, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:39:29.371 --> 03:39:31.232]  They're no longer representing us.
[03:39:31.232 --> 03:39:35.114]  They're doing instead what they're told.
[03:39:35.114 --> 03:39:41.297]  Because they have them by their hidden parts and they're dragging them through the square dance.
[03:39:41.297 --> 03:39:42.958]  That's what's really going on.
[03:39:42.958 --> 03:39:45.619]  And you and I, I don't want to use the word victims,
[03:39:46.337 --> 03:39:49.298]  We're the false beneficiaries of it.
[03:39:49.298 --> 03:39:50.438]  Okay?
[03:39:50.438 --> 03:39:52.058]  We're not winning that one.
[03:39:52.058 --> 03:39:54.119]  We're losing that one every step of the way.
[03:39:54.119 --> 03:39:59.960]  Look at how our lives have been reshaped over one generation already, two generations for sure.
[03:39:59.960 --> 03:40:13.563]  From a single household income, from the trades to the professions, you could expect to raise a couple of kids, have a nice home, drive a car, every few years get a different one.
[03:40:14.580 --> 03:40:18.325]  Save for retirement and have something to look forward to.
[03:40:18.325 --> 03:40:21.229]  And you don't have that anymore.
[03:40:21.229 --> 03:40:26.897]  It's been hijacked by this technocracy and you're told to accept it.
[03:40:26.897 --> 03:40:27.678]  That's okay.
[03:40:29.213 --> 03:40:32.995]  And the guys of, well, you know, we're changing all our roles.
[03:40:32.995 --> 03:40:36.977]  You know, women can now engage outside the home that they didn't do in those days.
[03:40:36.977 --> 03:40:38.058]  I believe in all that.
[03:40:38.058 --> 03:40:39.578]  I think that's true.
[03:40:39.578 --> 03:40:43.440]  But it's also missing a lot of the main points.
[03:40:43.440 --> 03:40:46.282]  We've lost a lot of our freedom and liberty along the way.
[03:40:46.282 --> 03:40:48.503]  Because the free time we used to have
[03:40:49.083 --> 03:40:51.605]  The time we used to have, we don't have anymore.
[03:40:51.605 --> 03:40:52.846]  It's consumed.
[03:40:52.846 --> 03:41:10.499]  Time we used to have to pay attention to what was going on in the world, to read, to engage, to teach our children, to engage with our neighbors on a face-to-face basis, not with an electronic mirror, an interface that makes sure the data stops for the intermediate areas to review.
[03:41:11.917 --> 03:41:23.179]  That's how most people communicate, whether it's on a cell phone, an iPad, the internet, whatever, you know, it's all electronically, digitally captured along the way and then used.
[03:41:23.888 --> 03:41:26.669]  For all different kinds of purposes.
[03:41:26.669 --> 03:41:35.412]  And so, you know, when I think about the synthetic systems of technology, they're kind of trying to mirror what human beings fundamentally are.
[03:41:35.412 --> 03:41:37.973]  And this is what gets lost in the show.
[03:41:37.973 --> 03:41:43.535]  One of the points I like to bring out, because a lot of my work goes back to the whole mind affects concepts.
[03:41:43.535 --> 03:41:45.996]  What can you do with the human brain?
[03:41:45.996 --> 03:41:49.277]  What can you do to move thought differently?
[03:41:49.857 --> 03:41:59.230]  And government really learned a lot in this realm, and I've written on this book, Controlling the Human Mind, which InfoWars store has available.
[03:41:59.230 --> 03:42:06.660]  You know, this book is 250 sources showing the evolution of mind control and propaganda at the ultimate level.
[03:42:07.248 --> 03:42:09.109]  Manipulating what goes on in your brain.
[03:42:09.109 --> 03:42:15.012]  The next jump for the internet that they're talking about, even PBS had a special called the World Wide Mind.
[03:42:15.012 --> 03:42:16.012]  Look it up.
[03:42:16.012 --> 03:42:17.933]  The World Wide Mind, PBS.
[03:42:17.933 --> 03:42:22.736]  The next connection for the internet isn't going to be a bunch of computers you can decide to turn off.
[03:42:22.736 --> 03:42:26.818]  It's going to be the mind of each human being on the planet.
[03:42:26.818 --> 03:42:28.598]  That's the prediction for the future.
[03:42:28.598 --> 03:42:31.600]  Imagine your mind linked to everyone else synthetically in some way.
[03:42:32.668 --> 03:42:34.289]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:42:57.864 --> 03:43:08.250]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[03:43:08.250 --> 03:43:13.073]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[03:43:13.073 --> 03:43:27.582]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little-d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting InfoWars.
[03:43:27.702 --> 03:43:45.471]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[03:43:45.471 --> 03:43:52.175]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[03:43:55.220 --> 03:43:59.842]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:43:59.842 --> 03:44:01.582]  We have a new super special.
[03:44:01.582 --> 03:44:04.163]  It's on everything with Force in its name.
[03:44:04.163 --> 03:44:09.545]  The new, already best-selling, Space Force, America's Back, awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[03:44:09.545 --> 03:44:10.646]  It's gonna be a hit shirt now.
[03:44:10.646 --> 03:44:11.226]  Hope you get it.
[03:44:11.226 --> 03:44:12.006]  Sports broadcast.
[03:44:12.006 --> 03:44:12.726]  Spreads the word.
[03:44:12.726 --> 03:44:13.587]  Great conversation piece.
[03:44:13.587 --> 03:44:13.767]  It's 33% off.
[03:44:14.967 --> 03:44:16.188]  We sold the t-shirt at 50% off.
[03:44:16.188 --> 03:44:17.048]  That'd be a cost.
[03:44:17.048 --> 03:44:19.849]  All the other Force products, it's all 50% off.
[03:44:19.849 --> 03:44:22.450]  DNA Force Plus, that is such a huge deal.
[03:44:22.450 --> 03:44:24.611]  That is the best CoQ10, PQQ system.
[03:44:24.611 --> 03:44:26.992]  Just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[03:44:26.992 --> 03:44:27.752]  50% off.
[03:44:27.752 --> 03:44:29.153]  Nobody gets close to that price.
[03:44:29.153 --> 03:44:30.554]  Rain Force Plus, amazing.
[03:44:30.554 --> 03:44:34.875]  Turbo Force, which is just tearing our energy clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[03:44:34.875 --> 03:44:36.856]  Ultimate Female Force is incredible as well.
[03:44:36.856 --> 03:44:38.557]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[03:44:38.837 --> 03:44:40.259]  All of the Force products.
[03:44:40.259 --> 03:44:41.621]  It's got Force in the name.
[03:44:41.621 --> 03:44:45.286]  It's 50-30% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:45.286 --> 03:44:48.210]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:48.210 --> 03:44:49.331]  InfoWars.
[03:44:49.331 --> 03:44:51.894]  The most banned network in the world.
[03:44:55.177 --> 03:44:56.258]  We've done our speech!
[03:44:56.258 --> 03:45:01.761]  We're at Infowars.com and Newswars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[03:45:01.761 --> 03:45:03.362]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans.
[03:45:03.362 --> 03:45:05.523]  But almost all of a sudden, we used to love you on air.
[03:45:05.523 --> 03:45:09.265]  It was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[03:45:09.265 --> 03:45:10.586]  Are you coming back?
[03:45:10.586 --> 03:45:11.727]  We're at Infowars.com.
[03:45:12.327 --> 03:45:13.488]  We're at newswars.com.
[03:45:13.488 --> 03:45:15.951]  Paul Watson's launched his own summit.news.
[03:45:15.951 --> 03:45:16.872]  We have our own videos.
[03:45:16.872 --> 03:45:17.693]  We have our own articles.
[03:45:17.693 --> 03:45:22.719]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[03:45:22.719 --> 03:45:24.982]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[03:45:24.982 --> 03:45:29.868]  InfoWars is coming!
[03:45:29.868 --> 03:45:29.948]  Woo!
[03:45:31.309 --> 03:45:34.051]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[03:45:34.051 --> 03:45:35.913]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[03:45:35.913 --> 03:45:38.896]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:45:38.896 --> 03:45:40.857]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[03:45:40.857 --> 03:45:44.360]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[03:45:44.360 --> 03:45:47.103]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[03:45:47.103 --> 03:45:49.365]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:45:49.365 --> 03:45:50.386]  That's where they find it.
[03:45:50.386 --> 03:45:52.367]  You know, there's things called websites.
[03:45:52.367 --> 03:45:52.768]  Just go there.
[03:46:00.413 --> 03:46:04.855]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border, talks about MS-13 and more.
[03:46:04.855 --> 03:46:05.796]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[03:46:05.796 --> 03:46:06.256]  Yes, sir.
[03:46:06.256 --> 03:46:07.556]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:46:07.556 --> 03:46:09.657]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[03:46:09.657 --> 03:46:15.580]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sports shirts, all the equipment.
[03:46:15.580 --> 03:46:17.541]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[03:46:17.541 --> 03:46:18.521]  God bless you, brother.
[03:46:18.521 --> 03:46:24.804]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread
[03:46:25.504 --> 03:46:26.605]  You're our only hope, brother.
[03:46:26.605 --> 03:46:28.927]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[03:46:28.927 --> 03:46:31.669]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[03:46:57.148 --> 03:47:06.551]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:06.551 --> 03:47:17.674]  I'm alive!
[03:47:17.674 --> 03:47:21.175]  And I see things light and clear today!
[03:47:21.175 --> 03:47:21.575]  I'm alive!
[03:47:23.223 --> 03:47:26.106]  And welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:47:26.106 --> 03:47:30.711]  This is Dr. Nick Begich in this Friday afternoon in this fourth hour.
[03:47:30.711 --> 03:47:41.023]  And we've been talking a lot about the technocracy today and also about sort of the underlying values of how to sort of come at the conversation and what's being lost in a lot of this.
[03:47:42.660 --> 03:47:53.227]  Is the profiling, when you think about this profiling that we're talking about, which is a really, again, collecting all that data and then looking at the individual.
[03:47:53.227 --> 03:48:04.195]  And then what is intended by the feedback loop that we're in is to excite your emotions, because then you sort of turn off the intellectual part and you start moving.
[03:48:05.314 --> 03:48:10.098]  And the emotions are meant to work with the intellectual part.
[03:48:10.098 --> 03:48:15.842]  I think about emotions again as sort of part of that matrix of experiences.
[03:48:15.842 --> 03:48:24.268]  You know, you're a father, you're a mother, you're a parent, you're a brother, you're a sister, you're an employee, you're all these things.
[03:48:25.197 --> 03:48:34.747]  And these are activities that you engage in, experiences that we engage in that spring from what we are internally from a point of awareness.
[03:48:34.747 --> 03:48:36.809]  This is how I segregate the two.
[03:48:36.809 --> 03:48:42.295]  When the awareness is in control, these things we do kind of line up.
[03:48:43.118 --> 03:48:53.903]  And manifesting differently for everyone, but in certain lines of activity and inquiry that continues to amplify what I call the divinity in us.
[03:48:53.903 --> 03:49:10.810]  And this is the greatest power against the technocracy is stepping into what you are and kind of remembering what's possible when sovereign people recognize it only takes one or two to make huge changes by just doing what is possible.
[03:49:12.035 --> 03:49:15.098]  I want to say that again, you know, do what's possible.
[03:49:15.098 --> 03:49:24.227]  A lot of people believe that you need this big grand plan that's so grand and so big you can't conceive that it can happen.
[03:49:24.227 --> 03:49:26.889]  Well, that won't work.
[03:49:26.889 --> 03:49:32.775]  Creation happens either in the universe or on the planet or through you as a creating
[03:49:33.804 --> 03:49:36.886]  You gotta have the faith to know what you can do.
[03:49:36.886 --> 03:49:40.287]  That's why if you know what you can do, it gets done.
[03:49:40.287 --> 03:49:45.869]  You know, that's the faith of a mustard seed analogy that we all have heard in our lifetimes.
[03:49:45.869 --> 03:49:51.652]  It's knowing what you can act on that's right and true, and that you're fortified to go and do.
[03:49:51.652 --> 03:49:53.713]  And then just jump into it and do it.
[03:49:53.713 --> 03:49:58.475]  You know, and that's the mark of an info warrior, actually, is that.
[03:49:59.115 --> 03:50:00.795]  It's not doing the impossible.
[03:50:00.795 --> 03:50:03.636]  It's not convincing someone that cannot be convinced.
[03:50:03.636 --> 03:50:08.857]  It's living a life that exemplifies that info war of what you are.
[03:50:08.857 --> 03:50:22.560]  All those things that you want to attach to in terms of ideas, concepts, objections, you know, things to be outraged over, they're all secondary to the underlying values in which you convey your information.
[03:50:22.560 --> 03:50:25.601]  If you can't do it on a platform of awareness,
[03:50:26.440 --> 03:50:28.081]  Which is what you are.
[03:50:28.081 --> 03:50:30.803]  Of your divinity, if you want to call it that.
[03:50:30.803 --> 03:50:35.725]  Or whatever you want to call it that really is the essence of what we are as human beings.
[03:50:35.725 --> 03:50:38.827]  It drives us through our experiences.
[03:50:38.827 --> 03:50:40.728]  That's what you should be calling the shots.
[03:50:40.728 --> 03:50:49.393]  And so, you know, one of the simple things, you know, when anger arises in you, the way to control it is just to look at it for a second.
[03:50:49.393 --> 03:50:54.416]  You know, as soon as you notice it, you literally can decide whether to continue in that vein.
[03:50:54.416 --> 03:50:55.977]  Let it just carry you away.
[03:50:56.849 --> 03:51:00.750]  Or whether you are going to assert the awareness that you are in control of it.
[03:51:00.750 --> 03:51:03.290]  The same is true with any other emotion.
[03:51:03.290 --> 03:51:05.771]  You decide how you engage it.
[03:51:05.771 --> 03:51:06.791]  You still experience it.
[03:51:06.791 --> 03:51:09.872]  Don't shut it off, because that makes you a sociopath.
[03:51:09.872 --> 03:51:19.594]  Experience it, but don't let it run away with, you know, this is the difference between someone who's awake and aware, remembering their divinity and what they are.
[03:51:19.594 --> 03:51:21.254]  At their rest, this is someone who doesn't.
[03:51:22.820 --> 03:51:23.421]  That's it.
[03:51:23.421 --> 03:51:24.781]  That's the big difference, right?
[03:51:24.781 --> 03:51:28.944]  I mean, at least as a starting point.
[03:51:28.944 --> 03:51:40.090]  And so when we think about all the conflicts that all of us are very upset about, and the way in which technology is working to sort of rob us of this aspect of who we are.
[03:51:40.530 --> 03:52:09.703]  You know, a lot of my research in the early days was about mind effects, mind control technologies, all the stuff that people heard about from the Manchurian candidates to MKUltra, the church committee investigation of the early 70s where all of this was disclosed, and the abuses of the CIA that were disclosed, and on and on and on, you know, and like Alex and several others, you know, we remember this and we try to convey it in a contextual way.
[03:52:10.319 --> 03:52:14.322]  Within a broader framework so that we can change it.
[03:52:14.322 --> 03:52:20.487]  And so it starts with each individual doing what you believe is right and true and stepping into that.
[03:52:20.487 --> 03:52:23.269]  That's the act of faith because you already know it.
[03:52:23.269 --> 03:52:25.771]  Don't do more than you know you can do, but do that.
[03:52:25.771 --> 03:52:31.995]  And everyone has a different thing they can do in the furtherance of their individual truth.
[03:52:31.995 --> 03:52:33.597]  And then chasing truth.
[03:52:33.597 --> 03:52:37.760]  One of the things I found is oftentimes you got to let go of what you thought was true because
[03:52:38.460 --> 03:52:41.563]  You got new information.
[03:52:41.563 --> 03:52:52.272]  And that's the mark of an intelligent person, truly evolving person, and remembering what you are again, because I think it all takes effect to our source.
[03:52:52.272 --> 03:52:57.937]  And when you look at what's happening in the world, it is essentially trying to duplicate this.
[03:52:57.937 --> 03:53:04.723]  Artificially, I was talking about the worldwide mind, something that PBS report on the idea of linking everybody's mind.
[03:53:05.683 --> 03:53:07.483]  In a synthetic way.
[03:53:07.483 --> 03:53:15.845]  And that's like makes what's going on now look like nothing, like nothing at all compared to that thought.
[03:53:15.845 --> 03:53:17.686]  But I believe we already do that.
[03:53:17.686 --> 03:53:19.266]  We already have that.
[03:53:19.266 --> 03:53:23.667]  If we can remember what we are and if we're responsible enough, you know, we'll fall into that.
[03:53:23.667 --> 03:53:25.488]  In fact, think about this.
[03:53:25.488 --> 03:53:30.369]  If that's true, if man can create this, think about what Judgment Day is.
[03:53:31.674 --> 03:53:33.056]  Is it going to be blackmail day?
[03:53:33.056 --> 03:53:40.125]  Or is it going to be decide who belongs in jail based on what you think day?
[03:53:40.125 --> 03:53:41.888]  Or is it judgment day?
[03:53:43.098 --> 03:53:50.640]  You know, think about this when it happens naturally in the Book of Life is opened, all knowledge is revealed, and then there's this gnashing of teeth.
[03:53:50.640 --> 03:54:01.524]  I think that might be that day that we know it's in the minds of everyone else and we are totally naked in front of the universe and the creation itself.
[03:54:01.524 --> 03:54:06.205]  And in that moment, we better be awful forgiving of ourselves at a starting point.
[03:54:07.538 --> 03:54:23.670]  And have grown at some level from the mistakes we've made, but more importantly, be forgiving also of each other and having experienced the same humanness of this experience and hopefully growing in that humanness in a way that makes us
[03:54:25.888 --> 03:54:37.812]  More aware, more awake, more in connection with what we are fundamentally, and as we fall into that connection fundamentally, this is where we change the world, when we recognize what we are truly created to do.
[03:54:37.812 --> 03:54:50.636]  You know, when you think about the brain as sort of this connecting point, you know, sort of think about it as the plug-in to your energetic spiritual nature, you know, sort of the medium of the brain.
[03:54:50.636 --> 03:54:51.937]  You have a left brain and a right brain.
[03:54:51.937 --> 03:54:55.298]  The right brain is order, the left brain is creative.
[03:54:56.042 --> 03:54:59.046]  OK, or chaos, you could even say.
[03:54:59.046 --> 03:55:08.056]  And if you can get both of these working together, this is where you get this incredible possibility set.
[03:55:08.056 --> 03:55:13.722]  And it's sort of the beginning point of how we project in the world and then through our words and our thoughts, we create.
[03:55:14.887 --> 03:55:16.528]  Wow, that's pretty amazing.
[03:55:16.528 --> 03:55:22.111]  You know, no other creature on the planet creates in the way humans are capable of creating.
[03:55:22.111 --> 03:55:24.833]  But it's not just the physical form.
[03:55:24.833 --> 03:55:25.853]  This is nothing.
[03:55:25.853 --> 03:55:31.136]  This is the shell through which we emerge into the earth and do our work in the earth.
[03:55:31.136 --> 03:55:33.537]  And we should do it respectfully and we should do it mindfully.
[03:55:33.537 --> 03:55:42.002]  And if we believe at all that we're creating the image and likeness of God, which many who listen to this program profess to believe, we should behave this way.
[03:55:42.654 --> 03:55:49.283]  We should behave no matter what the conflict is that we're facing, but we should try to find the path through it.
[03:55:49.283 --> 03:55:52.608]  You know, this is the path through order and chaos.
[03:55:52.608 --> 03:55:56.313]  And in fact, when both hemispheres of the brain come together,
[03:55:57.654 --> 03:56:01.736]  And they're both working in harmony together, the way they're intended.
[03:56:01.736 --> 03:56:06.337]  The way small children actually function more predominantly than adults.
[03:56:06.337 --> 03:56:12.259]  Think about this, you know, pay attention to small children, but their brains are more balanced, so they tend to be very creative.
[03:56:12.259 --> 03:56:14.179]  They learn at an accelerated rate.
[03:56:14.179 --> 03:56:22.322]  Think about all of what is learned between three and five-year-olds in that range, when their brains are the best balance and they're just maturing.
[03:56:22.882 --> 03:56:36.813]  And then we began to carve that away with our institutions that so closely identify what we are with this carrier and these experiences that we have and people thrust on us in terms of our cultures that tell us who we are.
[03:56:36.813 --> 03:56:38.074]  But that is not who we are.
[03:56:38.661 --> 03:56:44.285]  Those are experiences and cultures, and they are separate from who we are fundamentally.
[03:56:44.285 --> 03:57:02.578]  And this gets back down to the core, the essence of what changes the world is individuals acting individually, not in a squishy collective, not in a highly monitored and directed society, the stuff of futurists and globalists and the elites.
[03:57:03.339 --> 03:57:12.853]  But one in a society that's based upon the freedom of the soul, the freedom of creativity, and the freedom of dialogue and discussion.
[03:57:12.853 --> 03:57:18.401]  And certainly it ought to be a lot more respectful than what we've seen demonstrated recently.
[03:57:19.139 --> 03:57:31.108]  But let's end this Friday on a note of let's spend the time thinking about what we can do and do a little bit, even if it's a smile to your neighbor or a step in a bigger direction.
[03:57:31.108 --> 03:57:36.972]  This has been Dr. Nick Begich in this fourth hour of InfoWars, changing the way we see the world.
[03:57:36.972 --> 03:57:37.933]  Let's do that together.
[03:57:37.933 --> 03:57:38.933]  You're the tip of the spear.
[03:57:38.933 --> 03:57:39.774]  Thanks for being here.
[03:57:43.467 --> 03:57:54.533]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[03:57:54.533 --> 03:58:03.418]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[03:58:03.418 --> 03:58:07.401]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[03:58:08.081 --> 03:58:14.570]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[03:58:14.570 --> 03:58:16.733]  And you may be experiencing backup too.
