[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:04.857]  Gavin McInnes is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:09.445]  Gavin McInnes, Joe Biggs, Miley Yiannopoulos, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:31.395]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:35.736]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:39.896]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:00:39.896 --> 00:00:42.017]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:47.378]  Take the children and yourself and hide out in the cellar.
[00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:56.928]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is November 1st, 2019.
[00:00:56.928 --> 00:01:07.330]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:21.714]  Congressman Louie Gohmert gave an extremely powerful nine-minute speech from the floor of the House, and we're going to air it in its entirety, coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.975]  That's just the best way to do this here.
[00:01:35.145 --> 00:01:38.528]  And it's precisely because of that that they intend to remove the president.
[00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.873]  That's the whole point.
[00:02:08.873 --> 00:02:21.900]  And so, we have reached that crossroads now, where individuals are going to have to decide what they're going to do to resist this.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:30.445]  Because the criminals that have taken control of much of the world want final control of the United States.
[00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:41.489]  And if they remove Trump, there is going to be a reign of terror against the American people.
[00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.510]  And they've said they're going to engage in a reign of terror, and they're already engaging in one.
[00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.250]  Now, Louie Gohmert is the canary in the coal mine.
[00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:00.792]  We're going to play this clip a lot today on air, not just the full clip, but we're going to play
[00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:13.071]  Where he talks about the fact that revolutions don't start with guns.
[00:03:13.071 --> 00:03:19.034]  Guns come at the end.
[00:03:19.034 --> 00:03:26.918]  And he says we're going into an area where there's going to be guns involved.
[00:03:26.918 --> 00:03:32.681]  And he says, I don't want guns to be involved.
[00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:44.875]  But he says, downstairs in a secret room, they're not letting even Congress see what's going on, and that's never been done before.
[00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:56.463]  And we have all these other witnesses and transcripts showing the president didn't do anything, and the head of the committee has read into the record a fake transcript.
[00:03:56.463 --> 00:04:02.567]  And they've been caught in all these other hoaxes, and they have armed men keeping us out of there.
[00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:27.811]  And then the few witnesses that are in there say that Schiff's telling the witnesses what to say and the list of witnesses all worked for Obama and Hillary and Clapper and Brennan and hate Trump with an absolute passion and are lying just like in the whole Kavanaugh hearings we saw.
[00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:31.614]  So they have passed and they have initiated
[00:04:41.602 --> 00:04:45.504]  Beginning of the impeachment process, it's live.
[00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:53.808]  And they know that it's going to trigger unrest if they remove Trump, and they're planning on that.
[00:04:53.808 --> 00:04:54.348]  This is it.
[00:04:54.348 --> 00:04:56.689]  This is the greatest challenge to America and its history.
[00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.331]  We couldn't fall from without, but we're falling from within.
[00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:07.695]  However you're watching, however you're listening on AM and FM stations, TV stations, or at infowares.com.org slash show, or at band.video, or wherever you are, tell people to tune in.
[00:05:07.695 --> 00:05:08.275]  This is history.
[00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:13.473]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[00:05:13.473 --> 00:05:15.394]  I don't care what your views are.
[00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:18.416]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:19.196]  That's important.
[00:05:19.196 --> 00:05:20.797]  But we have something in common.
[00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:24.399]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:32.108]  Clinton deep state bag man Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to Congress and the world.
[00:05:32.108 --> 00:05:37.854]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted.
[00:05:37.854 --> 00:05:42.279]  Word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.042]  From my new home in New Zealand I will
[00:05:46.976 --> 00:05:50.518]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[00:05:50.518 --> 00:05:52.438]  Not so fast, criminal!
[00:05:52.438 --> 00:05:56.340]  We're going to bring you to justice, and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.162]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[00:06:01.162 --> 00:06:08.305]  But the American people know how much you hate us, and we're fighting back at Infowars.com, Newswars.com, and Banned.video!
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:38.929]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this November 1st, 2019 worldwide broadcast.
[00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:40.591]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:40.591 --> 00:06:44.115]  And the establishment wanted us off air before they tried to remove Trump.
[00:06:44.115 --> 00:06:45.596]  They want everybody else silenced as well.
[00:06:46.397 --> 00:06:48.680]  And now they're banning Republican ads on the internet.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.004]  They're banning Republican congressmen from even speaking on Twitter and Facebook.
[00:06:53.004 --> 00:06:56.288]  They're banning Trump from running pro-women ads.
[00:06:56.288 --> 00:07:00.272]  And Trump's put up with it so far, and so it's eliciting this criminal response.
[00:07:00.272 --> 00:07:08.901]  The good news is, the president has done what we've said he should do three years ago, started having fireside chats, national addresses, weekly to the American people.
[00:07:10.762 --> 00:07:14.624]  To bypass all this and cut right to it, but that's too little too late.
[00:07:14.624 --> 00:07:27.431]  He has to do emergency addresses to the nation about how Schiff and Hillary and all of them are running this and how they plan to run Hillary again after he's been impeached and Pelosi is the president.
[00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:37.476]  And now CNN's saying they're going to remove Trump and then Pence and put in Pelosi, that's the Constitution, she will then appoint Hillary as the vice president.
[00:07:38.592 --> 00:07:43.833]  But that might not be even needed because Hillary can then run against weak Republicans once Trump's been removed.
[00:07:43.833 --> 00:07:45.914]  They mean to do it.
[00:07:45.914 --> 00:07:47.434]  This is dangerous.
[00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:49.454]  Now, Louie Gohmert laid it out.
[00:07:49.454 --> 00:07:52.795]  It's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:07:52.795 --> 00:07:58.456]  Texas Congressman, he said, revolutions don't start violently.
[00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:00.617]  The shooting comes later.
[00:08:00.617 --> 00:08:05.778]  And he explains that we're now entering that wheelhouse of a shooting war and that they're eliciting it.
[00:08:06.693 --> 00:08:15.695]  If they illegally try to remove the President and don't follow procedures correctly, then it becomes a discussion of force against this illegitimate group.
[00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:23.697]  If the Justice Department and everybody else won't act, the Democrats and the Globalists, funded by foreign states, have brought America into its greatest crisis in its history.
[00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:24.818]  Make no mistake.
[00:08:24.818 --> 00:08:29.679]  The full video is on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:08:29.679 --> 00:08:32.440]  We'll put that headline back up for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.840]  I'm asking everyone to go there.
[00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:40.584]  Representative Gohmert says coup to push America into civil war.
[00:08:40.584 --> 00:08:46.606]  Now here is much of what he had to say in the floor of the House yesterday.
[00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:56.851]  You get to ask the questions, you see the questions, you get to hear the answers, and you get to observe the witnesses.
[00:08:56.851 --> 00:09:00.513]  It's important.
[00:09:00.513 --> 00:09:00.953]  And yet,
[00:09:03.422 --> 00:09:24.842]  Under orders of the Speaker and Chairman Schiff, this so-called comparative grand jury kept the huge majority out of those hearings where we could hear and see for ourselves.
[00:09:26.283 --> 00:09:55.060]  And now we find out through the vote today that, yeah, the Judiciary Committee is ultimately going to get this from the Intelligence Committee, but never in the history of this country have we had such gross unfairness that one party would put armed guards with guns to prevent the duly authorized people from being able to hear the witnesses and see them for themselves.
[00:09:56.164 --> 00:09:59.606]  And then, oh, we hear from this resolution today.
[00:09:59.606 --> 00:10:09.411]  We're going to send you the depositions after we get through doctoring and looking at and editing the transcripts.
[00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:14.554]  We'll send you those so you have the evidence you need.
[00:10:14.554 --> 00:10:20.937]  That's not the kind of evidence that a coup should be based on.
[00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:31.929]  If we're going to have what they're trying to legalize as a coup, we ought to have a right to see each of those witnesses.
[00:10:31.929 --> 00:10:39.615]  And the only potential use for the deposition should be impeachment of those witnesses.
[00:10:39.615 --> 00:10:40.475]  Nothing else.
[00:10:40.475 --> 00:10:44.599]  Not for anything substantive.
[00:10:44.599 --> 00:10:45.940]  The President's attorney
[00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:55.590]  Unlike in 74 and 98, we're not allowed to be there, even see and hear the witnesses.
[00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:04.195]  So the references to this being a star chamber are not inappropriate.
[00:11:04.195 --> 00:11:12.380]  It's outrageous what's been going on for people who truly care about due process.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.020]  Regarding the
[00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:26.440]  The procedures now, the Judiciary Committee must operate pursuant to the procedures imposed by the Chairman of the Rules Committee.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:42.009]  Well, previously, one of the oldest committees in the House of Representatives, the Judiciary Committee, in prior impeachments made the rules for the impeachment hearing.
[00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:46.242]  We didn't have it dictated by the Rules Committee.
[00:11:46.242 --> 00:11:49.108]  No, because this is the Judiciary Committee.
[00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:53.837]  These are people that are supposed to have expertise in constitutional issues.
[00:11:55.771 --> 00:12:05.079]  So, when you have the committee that has more expertise in constitutional issues, what did the majority do?
[00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:12.865]  We don't want the committee with the most expertise on constitutional issues dealing with these constitutional issues.
[00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:23.875]  We want to put armed guards outside a hearing and have it in a secret compartmented information facility.
[00:12:26.229 --> 00:12:33.852]  And we're not going to let the other side call their own witnesses so we get a fair picture of what actually went on.
[00:12:33.852 --> 00:12:37.834]  And we're not even going to let them ask questions we don't want them to ask.
[00:12:37.834 --> 00:12:41.135]  We'll instruct the witnesses not to answer.
[00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:49.219]  Because, you see, they want it to be a one-sided, non-due process sham court.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:58.325]  And it's about to push this country to a civil war if they were to get their wishes.
[00:12:58.325 --> 00:13:07.692]  And if there's one thing I don't want to see in my lifetime, I don't want to ever have participation in, it's a civil war.
[00:13:07.692 --> 00:13:16.059]  Some historian, I don't remember who, said guns are only involved in the last phase of a civil war.
[00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:29.687]  What's going on here has not protected the Constitution, it's not protected the institutions, it's not protected this little experiment in self-government.
[00:13:29.687 --> 00:13:35.308]  No, what it has done is put it all at risk.
[00:13:35.308 --> 00:13:47.071]  Because what some people in this body don't seem to understand is, when you set a precedent as dangerous as what we have been watching for the last three years,
[00:13:51.204 --> 00:14:06.557]  It won't be me, but there will be Republicans, if this isn't stopped, there will be Republicans that will take the precedent of what the Democrats have done here and use it against a Democratic president.
[00:14:06.557 --> 00:14:10.681]  Try to set him up and create a coup.
[00:14:10.681 --> 00:14:14.224]  Like I say, it won't be me, but that's the way history works.
[00:14:15.134 --> 00:14:30.060]  Then somebody sets a precedent, then eventually somebody, also not concerned about due process, is going to try to mimic that and go one further.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.001]  In 1974, 1998, the committee procedures, during those Clinton and Nixon
[00:14:37.927 --> 00:14:38.568]  Impeachment
[00:15:08.988 --> 00:15:17.619]  The President's Council could also review all evidence obtained in the course of the impeachment inquiry.
[00:15:17.619 --> 00:15:25.529]  Not only has the President's Council not been allowed to do any of those things that have been done in the past to ensure due process and fairness,
[00:15:27.609 --> 00:15:44.034]  Even the rest of this voting body that will have to vote on an impeachment, we're not allowed to see the witnesses, to hear the witnesses, to review the transcripts until after they're through working with the transcripts.
[00:15:44.034 --> 00:15:53.257]  This resolution today bifurcates the impeachment, only allows President's Council to participate in Judiciary Committee proceedings
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.583]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:56.583 --> 00:15:58.365]  Did you hear that?
[00:15:58.365 --> 00:16:00.908]  Civil wars don't start with shooting.
[00:16:00.908 --> 00:16:02.409]  That comes at the end.
[00:16:02.409 --> 00:16:04.992]  And we're beginning to approach that point.
[00:16:04.992 --> 00:16:05.773]  This is real.
[00:16:05.773 --> 00:16:06.534]  This is happening.
[00:16:06.534 --> 00:16:06.935]  Stay with us.
[00:16:08.305 --> 00:16:09.526]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:16:09.526 --> 00:16:13.447]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:13.447 --> 00:16:14.988]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:14.988 --> 00:16:17.949]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:23.511]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:27.666]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.

[00:19:11.703 --> 00:19:16.944]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me, and she had her digital textbook.
[00:19:16.944 --> 00:19:27.847]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table, and I clicked on iodine, and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough iodine.
[00:19:27.847 --> 00:19:32.008]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy, and it's not true.
[00:19:32.008 --> 00:19:34.709]  But, Dad, it's right here on the periodic table.
[00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:35.349]  When I click it,
[00:19:35.589 --> 00:19:36.830]  Saying exactly what you said.
[00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:42.893]  And I said, I know honey, that's why I have you take a high quality nutraceutical grade iodine.
[00:19:42.893 --> 00:19:45.455]  It's because it's why you're so vibrant.
[00:19:45.455 --> 00:19:46.756]  It's why you're so alive.
[00:19:46.756 --> 00:19:52.819]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age.
[00:19:52.819 --> 00:19:56.602]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself.
[00:19:56.602 --> 00:20:01.845]  To know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion, are mentally retarded.
[00:20:02.265 --> 00:20:05.007]  On the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[00:20:05.007 --> 00:20:07.228]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[00:20:07.228 --> 00:20:14.712]  Infowars.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:28.576 --> 00:20:29.696]  We're good.
[00:20:54.568 --> 00:21:02.793]  Are we going to sit here and let a bunch of satanic pedophiles completely dominate the country and have their way with us?
[00:21:02.793 --> 00:21:11.919]  Are we going to let them destroy the rule of law, have kangaroo courts, persecute innocent people in the streets, launch endless wars in our name?
[00:21:11.919 --> 00:21:16.842]  Or are we going to give back to God?
[00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:18.744]  That's the question.
[00:21:18.744 --> 00:21:20.325]  And Louie Gohmert of Texas,
[00:21:21.533 --> 00:21:22.353]  Laid it out.
[00:21:22.353 --> 00:21:37.861]  Armed men under the command of the Democrats are having secret kangaroo hearings with known liars who've been caught lying, who work for Hillary and Obama and Clapper and Brennan and the rest of them, and they are leading us into an armed civil war.
[00:21:37.861 --> 00:21:41.363]  They've been talking about removing the president outside of law.
[00:21:41.363 --> 00:21:48.006]  They've been talking about removing him saying he's mentally ill because they couldn't get the impeachment, they thought.
[00:21:48.006 --> 00:21:51.208]  So instead, they're going forward with a rigged event.
[00:21:53.151 --> 00:21:55.872]  Which is extremely dangerous and is illegal.
[00:21:55.872 --> 00:22:00.853]  So here is the congressman from Texas talking about how civil wars really started.
[00:22:00.853 --> 00:22:03.094]  We're in one now.
[00:22:03.094 --> 00:22:16.497]  Where they're censoring a whole class of people and persecuting them and taking their bank accounts and beating them up and throwing coffee on them and calling them Nazis.
[00:22:16.497 --> 00:22:18.478]  And then calling themselves the defenders of speech.
[00:22:18.478 --> 00:22:18.898]  It's sick.
[00:22:20.267 --> 00:22:24.350]  And then that very group of globalists are the ones that have sold the nation out.
[00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:27.113]  So here's the key to what Congressman Gohmert said.
[00:22:27.113 --> 00:22:30.816]  The full speech is on Infowars.com.
[00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:38.602]  We don't want the committee with the most expertise on constitutional issues dealing with these constitutional issues.
[00:22:38.602 --> 00:22:49.611]  We want to put armed guards outside a hearing and have it in a secret compartmented information facility.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:59.584]  And we're not going to let the other side call their own witnesses so we get a fair picture of what actually went on.
[00:22:59.584 --> 00:23:03.566]  And we're not even going to let them ask questions we don't want them to ask.
[00:23:03.566 --> 00:23:06.868]  We'll instruct the witnesses not to answer.
[00:23:06.868 --> 00:23:14.953]  Because, you see, they want it to be a one-sided, non-due process sham court.
[00:23:17.034 --> 00:23:24.058]  And it's about to push this country to a civil war if they were to get their wishes.
[00:23:24.058 --> 00:23:33.422]  And if there's one thing I don't want to see in my lifetime, I don't want to ever have participation in, it's a civil war.
[00:23:33.422 --> 00:23:41.787]  Some historian, I don't remember who, said guns are only involved in the last phase of a civil war.
[00:23:43.695 --> 00:23:48.137]  What's going on here has not protected the Constitution.
[00:23:48.137 --> 00:23:51.118]  It's not protected the institutions.
[00:23:51.118 --> 00:23:55.400]  It's not protected this little experiment in self-government.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.761]  No, what it has done is put it all at risk.
[00:24:02.003 --> 00:24:20.228]  Absolutely, it is the globalist foreign powers with their agents doing all of this and you're going to see the most incredible clips ever of Brennan and Clapper and others and the former CIA director McLaughlin saying thank God
[00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:24.332]  For the deep state, says John McLaughlin.
[00:24:24.332 --> 00:24:27.892]  Like they're these heroes, and thank God there's no chain of command for us.
[00:24:27.892 --> 00:24:31.773]  Yeah, no Bill of Rights, no Constitution, no due process.
[00:24:31.773 --> 00:24:39.775]  Not even a branch of government, just put in by Hillary, the Clintons, put in by Obama.
[00:24:39.775 --> 00:24:42.495]  Runnin' the show.
[00:24:42.495 --> 00:24:43.876]  Believe you can do whatever you want.
[00:24:43.876 --> 00:24:48.577]  Created ISIS, destabilized the Middle East.
[00:24:48.577 --> 00:24:49.717]  Committed all these crimes.
[00:24:54.022 --> 00:24:56.944]  Think about that.
[00:24:56.944 --> 00:25:07.650]  And they get up there in this clip I'm about to play to them about how they are the most moral, good people and how they are trooping up to the little secret hearings and spewing their lies and their garbage.
[00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:08.491]  You find out who's doing it.
[00:25:08.491 --> 00:25:10.292]  They literally all are the adjuncts.
[00:25:12.967 --> 00:25:27.479]  The gophers, the secretaries of these individuals that think because they got in control of these giant, sprawling intelligence agencies that are supposedly to fight the Russians in the Cold War, that it's their right to rule over us now.
[00:25:27.479 --> 00:25:33.644]  And that they're the permanent, fourth branch of government that is above the law.
[00:25:33.644 --> 00:25:34.004]  Here they are.
[00:25:37.264 --> 00:25:46.929]  I have to agree that now the impeachment inquiry is underway, sparked by a complaint from someone within the intelligence community.
[00:25:46.929 --> 00:25:55.193]  It feeds the president's concern and often used term about a deep state being there to take him out.
[00:25:55.193 --> 00:25:57.234]  Thank God for the deep state.
[00:25:57.234 --> 00:25:58.815]  Hit pause, please.
[00:25:58.815 --> 00:25:59.575]  Great job, crew.
[00:25:59.575 --> 00:26:00.456]  Back that up again.
[00:26:01.783 --> 00:26:02.363]  From the start.
[00:26:02.363 --> 00:26:11.508]  Here's the reporter, CBS, saying, you have the deep state, your secretaries, your managers, your viceroys.
[00:26:11.508 --> 00:26:12.969]  It's the list of them here.
[00:26:12.969 --> 00:26:13.889]  I'll go over it later.
[00:26:13.889 --> 00:26:15.550]  Michael Savage is coming on next.
[00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:18.432]  We'll get back into all this.
[00:26:18.432 --> 00:26:23.454]  And Brennan is all on a power trip, arrogantly looking like a crocodile.
[00:26:23.454 --> 00:26:26.776]  Just looking like a psycho from a movie.
[00:26:26.776 --> 00:26:27.777]  Former CIA director.
[00:26:27.777 --> 00:26:30.238]  Next, the other former CIA director that thinks they own this country.
[00:26:31.203 --> 00:26:32.564]  Globalist.
[00:26:32.564 --> 00:26:34.766]  He says, thank God for the deep state.
[00:26:34.766 --> 00:26:37.008]  Intel traders admit they want to take out Trump.
[00:26:37.008 --> 00:26:38.589]  They say that too.
[00:26:38.589 --> 00:26:40.630]  It's all by them, the whole chain.
[00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.072]  And they think they control Congress.
[00:26:42.072 --> 00:26:44.233]  They're having fake secret hearings right now.
[00:26:44.233 --> 00:26:50.438]  And Goldberg's saying, hey, you're taking it to the point of war.
[00:26:50.438 --> 00:26:52.260]  And now we need to start talking about that.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.083]  But you know they're going to stage terror attacks and blame it on us.
[00:26:56.083 --> 00:26:58.305]  But long before we get to that point, they will trigger it.
[00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.190]  But we're now here, folks.
[00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:04.611]  Now listen to this sycophant invert reality.
[00:27:04.611 --> 00:27:06.452]  Listen to evil.
[00:27:06.452 --> 00:27:16.494]  You'd have to agree that now the impeachment inquiry is underway sparked by a complaint from someone within the intelligence community.
[00:27:16.494 --> 00:27:24.735]  It feeds the president's concern and often used term about a deep state being there to take him out.
[00:27:24.735 --> 00:27:26.516]  Thank God for the deep state.
[00:27:30.862 --> 00:27:33.765]  I mean, I think, you know, everyone... Look at all those old spokes.
[00:27:33.765 --> 00:27:44.496]  ...this progression of diplomats and intelligence officers and White House people trooping up to Capitol Hill right now and saying, these are people who are doing their duty or responding to a higher call.
[00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:44.616]  Oh.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.524]  It doesn't... Well, think about it for a minute.
[00:27:52.524 --> 00:28:01.412]  With all of the people who knew what was going on here, it took an intelligence officer to step forward and say something about it, which was the...
[00:28:03.696 --> 00:28:06.478]  The trigger that then unleashed everything else.
[00:28:06.478 --> 00:28:08.740]  Like the fake WNDs you guys made up, the CIA?
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:22.251]  What I tell American people, why that happens is this is the institution in the US government that with all of its flaws and it makes mistakes, is institutionally committed to objectivity and to telling the truth.
[00:28:22.251 --> 00:28:29.216]  It is one of the few institutions in Washington... Oh, one of the few we can trust is the leftist globalist running the CIA.
[00:28:29.216 --> 00:28:30.757]  ...to speak the truth.
[00:28:30.757 --> 00:28:32.519]  It's engraved in marble in the lobby.
[00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.403]  It's engraved in marble at the lobby!
[00:28:37.403 --> 00:28:37.463]  Wow!
[00:28:40.342 --> 00:28:46.006]  And they'll get rid of that new process for us and have all their minions come out and say, intimidate Trump supporters and physically attack them.
[00:28:46.006 --> 00:28:49.789]  Well, you know, Mr. Tough Guy, none of these guys ever killed anybody themselves.
[00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:51.410]  They just gave the orders.
[00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.272]  And now they think they're going to whoop America's ass.
[00:28:54.272 --> 00:28:56.914]  They think they're going to piss on our grave.
[00:28:56.914 --> 00:29:01.918]  And all these guys, I mean, Brennan's a communist admittedly, and say they want China to dominate us.
[00:29:01.918 --> 00:29:04.820]  No, son, your expiration date is up!
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.782]  You're going to get your card punched!

[00:30:14.457 --> 00:30:17.461]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[00:30:17.461 --> 00:30:22.267]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something you don't know.
[00:30:22.267 --> 00:30:23.148]  But I'm here to tell you.
[00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:33.322]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life completely changes.
[00:30:33.322 --> 00:30:34.063]  I'm healthier.
[00:30:34.063 --> 00:30:35.425]  I have more energy.
[00:30:35.425 --> 00:30:36.246]  I lose weight.

[00:31:48.053 --> 00:31:49.635]  That's 50% off.
[00:31:49.635 --> 00:31:50.135]  Free shipping.
[00:31:50.135 --> 00:31:51.016]  Double Patriot points.
[00:31:51.016 --> 00:31:52.157]  All this is free shipping.
[00:31:52.157 --> 00:31:52.837]  Double Patriot points.
[00:31:52.837 --> 00:31:53.378]  That's about
[00:31:53.638 --> 00:31:56.742]  To end living defense that everybody loves so much.
[00:31:56.742 --> 00:31:57.784]  That's 50% off.
[00:31:57.784 --> 00:31:59.987]  That's about to end.
[00:31:59.987 --> 00:32:01.589]  It is a huge sale.
[00:32:01.589 --> 00:32:05.174]  Infowarsstore.com and your purchases from the Infowars.
[00:32:05.174 --> 00:32:08.539]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.352]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[00:32:14.352 --> 00:32:22.335]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[00:32:22.335 --> 00:32:24.916]  It's just that simple.
[00:32:24.916 --> 00:32:31.319]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[00:32:31.319 --> 00:32:31.859]  Others like
[00:32:32.419 --> 00:32:34.521]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[00:32:34.521 --> 00:32:35.241]  Get both.
[00:32:35.241 --> 00:32:36.702]  They're both great for you.
[00:32:36.702 --> 00:32:41.126]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[00:32:41.126 --> 00:32:43.328]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:44.689]  That's why I harp on it.
[00:32:44.689 --> 00:32:48.852]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[00:32:48.852 --> 00:32:52.114]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long.
[00:32:52.114 --> 00:32:52.855]  It's simple.
[00:32:52.855 --> 00:32:57.458]  Get your high quality iodine at InfoWarsTore.com and help fund the InfoWar.
[00:32:57.458 --> 00:32:58.499]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.244]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[00:33:02.244 --> 00:33:04.066]  It's the Iodine Challenge.
[00:33:04.066 --> 00:33:12.138]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[00:33:12.138 --> 00:33:14.761]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.711 --> 00:33:32.661]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:36.967]  You better believe you got one!
[00:33:36.967 --> 00:33:42.034]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:53.626 --> 00:34:01.370]  We don't want the committee with the most expertise on constitutional issues dealing with these constitutional issues.
[00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:15.698]  We want to put armed guards outside a hearing and have it in a secret compartmented information facility and we're not going to let
[00:34:16.792 --> 00:34:22.394]  The other side called their own witnesses so we get a fair picture of what actually went on.
[00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:26.356]  And we're not even going to let them ask questions we don't want them to ask.
[00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:29.657]  We'll instruct the witnesses not to answer.
[00:34:29.657 --> 00:34:39.841]  Because you see, they want it to be a one-sided, non-due process, sham court.
[00:34:39.841 --> 00:34:45.404]  And it's about to push this country to a civil war if they were to get their wishes.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:56.223]  And if there's one thing I don't want to see in my lifetime, I don't want to ever have participation in, it's a civil war.
[00:34:56.223 --> 00:35:04.566]  Some historian, I don't remember who, said guns are only involved in the last phase of a civil war.
[00:35:06.493 --> 00:35:10.956]  What's going on here has not protected the Constitution.
[00:35:10.956 --> 00:35:13.938]  It's not protected the institutions.
[00:35:13.938 --> 00:35:18.220]  It's not protected this little experiment in self-government.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:25.825]  No, what it has done is put it all at risk.
[00:35:25.825 --> 00:35:28.346]  Our nation and the world is in the middle of a crisis.
[00:35:28.346 --> 00:35:35.351]  There are populist rebellions against globalism, against these unelected kleptocracies happening everywhere.
[00:35:36.431 --> 00:35:38.092]  Davos two years ago said, G.G.
[00:35:38.092 --> 00:35:41.135]  Ping, the dictator of China can crush America.
[00:35:41.135 --> 00:35:46.199]  We've seen the massive Chai Com censorship of Hollywood and the publishing industry and so much more.
[00:35:46.199 --> 00:35:51.623]  Michael Savage had one of his best-selling books spiked by the Chai Coms.
[00:35:51.623 --> 00:35:57.748]  Michael Savage joins us, Dr. Savage, and we're very blessed to have him until the end of this hour.
[00:35:57.748 --> 00:36:00.710]  He's got a big event coming up at michaelsavage.com.
[00:36:02.332 --> 00:36:05.673]  It's already sold out, but there's going to be online availability.
[00:36:05.673 --> 00:36:22.901]  This is the type of thing you want to watch, where he gets into the mindset of being a conservative, living in San Francisco, and he can really speak to the madness, the mental disorder that is leftist, where now convicted pedophiles lead drag queen story times for small children.
[00:36:22.901 --> 00:36:27.083]  So to talk about the state of the world right now, and the peril this republic's in, and the fact that
[00:36:28.766 --> 00:36:30.108]  This nation, I think, is fighting for our lives.
[00:36:30.108 --> 00:36:31.550]  Michael Savage.
[00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:33.472]  Michael, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:36:33.472 --> 00:36:37.617]  Well, Alex, you're the gladiator and you keep on pounding the opposition there.
[00:36:37.617 --> 00:36:38.178]  I love it.
[00:36:38.178 --> 00:36:39.039]  How do you keep doing it?
[00:36:39.039 --> 00:36:39.700]  What are you taking?
[00:36:40.711 --> 00:36:44.792]  Well, you're the big botanist, but I do take a lot of stuff you recommend.
[00:36:44.792 --> 00:36:51.375]  Seriously, wow, let's get this out of the way first because it's so interesting and it ties into my first question.
[00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:53.956]  You're the one that coined the term that liberalism is a mental disorder.
[00:36:53.956 --> 00:36:56.357]  You're doing a big speech about this.
[00:36:56.357 --> 00:36:57.717]  What the hell is their problem?
[00:36:57.717 --> 00:36:58.777]  Can't they see they're pushing it?
[00:36:58.777 --> 00:37:02.659]  No, I published, I have the book right in my hand, Liberalism and a Mental Disorder.
[00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:05.400]  I published it in 2006.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.161]  It wasn't meant to be sarcastic.
[00:37:07.161 --> 00:37:08.401]  I wasn't Jonathan Swift.
[00:37:09.432 --> 00:37:15.995]  I knew exactly what I was talking about, only I didn't know it was a terminal mental disorder.
[00:37:15.995 --> 00:37:17.776]  I thought it was curable.
[00:37:17.776 --> 00:37:26.420]  The problem is, liberalism is an incurable mental disorder, and I am not talking about decent kind, reasonable liberals of the Voltairian kind.
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:30.402]  You know, I may disagree with you, but I'd fight to the death you're right to say it.
[00:37:30.402 --> 00:37:34.144]  Remember that beautiful saying by Voltaire?
[00:37:34.144 --> 00:37:35.424]  Those days are long over.
[00:37:35.424 --> 00:37:38.466]  It's no longer, I may disagree with you, but I'd fight to the death you're right to say it.
[00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:47.638]  The progressives of today, who are the fascists of today, say, I may disagree with you, but I will kill you rather than let you say another word.
[00:37:47.638 --> 00:37:49.858]  And so we are at the Civil War.
[00:37:49.858 --> 00:37:52.759]  You know, there used to be a thing called the Cold War, Alex.
[00:37:52.759 --> 00:37:56.580]  We're way past the Cold War because they're fighting a hot war.
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:02.701]  They try to attack you in restaurants, as they've done to various people in the media, myself included.
[00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:08.682]  How unusual is it for a man my age, a law-abiding citizen, a man with higher degrees,
[00:38:09.528 --> 00:38:11.249]  Because these people are homicidal maniacs.
[00:38:39.798 --> 00:39:08.776]  The other night, at a private club in San Francisco for about a hundred people, it was closed to the public, thank God, so these psychos couldn't even, they didn't know where I was, and I did a video of it, Alex, called, it's at SavageNationLive.com, it's about an hour long, it hasn't been posted yet, it will be at the end of the day, and we had about a hundred people, one table of ten, no one knew who they were, they asked for anonymity, our active duty special ops guys, people I had met,
[00:39:10.288 --> 00:39:13.609]  Why don't I tell you, Alex, these are the best people on Earth, right?
[00:39:13.609 --> 00:39:15.529]  But do you know what's going on in this country?
[00:39:15.529 --> 00:39:20.490]  Here are guys who have given up, let's say, fortunes.
[00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.771]  These guys are smart enough to have done anything in their lives.
[00:39:23.771 --> 00:39:25.531]  Let's all agree with that.
[00:39:25.531 --> 00:39:30.573]  If you're airborne, if you're a special ops, you could do anything in your life, right?
[00:39:30.573 --> 00:39:32.273]  But they devote their life to the nation.
[00:39:32.273 --> 00:39:34.133]  They give their life for the nation.
[00:39:34.133 --> 00:39:36.354]  They'll take a bullet for the nation.
[00:39:36.354 --> 00:39:37.354]  So, here they are.
[00:39:38.507 --> 00:39:46.213]  No one knows who they are, but you can see that they look better and stronger than everybody else there with their wives or lady friends.
[00:39:46.213 --> 00:39:48.115]  And they were an anonymous group.
[00:39:48.115 --> 00:39:59.584]  I learned that the left is so activated in this country now that they have hunted down the home addresses and school addresses of the children of these people.
[00:39:59.584 --> 00:40:05.269]  It's exactly what went on in Vietnam after the communists took over South Vietnam.
[00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:06.350]  It's exactly what went on
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.482]  During the purges of the Hitler years.
[00:40:09.482 --> 00:40:12.745]  It's exactly what went on during Stalin's purges.
[00:40:12.745 --> 00:40:19.171]  And if these scumbags don't understand that we know who they are, they're living in a dream world.
[00:40:19.171 --> 00:40:21.052]  That's the world we're living in.
[00:40:21.052 --> 00:40:23.714]  And how do they cover their tracks?
[00:40:23.714 --> 00:40:24.095]  How?
[00:40:24.095 --> 00:40:30.280]  By attacking a white heterosexual Christian man named Donald Trump.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.503]  Now, this may be controversial, but I could give a damn less.
[00:40:34.483 --> 00:40:40.716]  It dawned on me at dawn this morning that the whole attack on Trump is being driven by racism.
[00:40:40.716 --> 00:40:43.281]  And I tweeted this this morning.
[00:40:43.281 --> 00:40:45.085]  Attacks on Trump based on racism.
[00:40:45.857 --> 00:40:48.259]  White, heterosexual, Christian male.
[00:40:48.259 --> 00:40:50.180]  Recall all of Obama's scandals.
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:52.082]  $170 billion to Iran.
[00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:53.803]  Where'd the dollars come from?
[00:40:53.803 --> 00:40:56.305]  No outcry from anti-white male media.
[00:40:56.305 --> 00:40:56.965]  Want more?
[00:40:56.965 --> 00:41:07.813]  And I have at least 20 more scandals of the first mixed-race president, Barack Hussein Obama, who was untouchable because of his mixed-race background, which is why he was handpicked.
[00:41:07.813 --> 00:41:11.216]  They knew he could get away with destroying the Constitution.
[00:41:11.216 --> 00:41:12.517]  Okay, so now we have Trump.
[00:41:13.615 --> 00:41:17.219]  He's not committed any impeachable offense whatsoever.
[00:41:17.219 --> 00:41:31.016]  The impeachable offense was committed by Nancy Golosi, a gangster, a gangster running a gang whose consigliere is Adam Shiples, a man without a country.
[00:41:31.016 --> 00:41:33.599]  That's who has committed the impeachable crimes.
[00:41:34.364 --> 00:41:39.606]  And we, the people, are supposed to sit here like dunces and putses and let them steal an election from us?
[00:41:39.606 --> 00:41:40.287]  No way!
[00:41:40.287 --> 00:41:41.227]  It's not happening!
[00:41:41.227 --> 00:41:44.329]  They're not stealing the presidency from us!
[00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:46.350]  And that's why it's perfect that you're here today.
[00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:47.350]  We're Simpawtico.
[00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:49.151]  We didn't talk before you came on.
[00:41:49.151 --> 00:41:51.012]  They've been bullying us, attacking us.
[00:41:51.012 --> 00:41:53.453]  Antifa openly works for Soros and others.
[00:41:53.453 --> 00:41:57.415]  They openly are targeting law enforcement, special operations, the FBI.
[00:41:57.415 --> 00:41:58.535]  They've openly targeted me.
[00:41:58.535 --> 00:42:00.136]  I have to have home security.
[00:42:00.136 --> 00:42:01.156]  Folks, they've been there.
[00:42:01.156 --> 00:42:01.937]  I'm not going to get into it.
[00:42:02.677 --> 00:42:08.160]  These are terrorists, and they know it, and they believe they're about to up the violence using firearms.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:13.623]  And as you said, even Special Operations has been now lazed by the left.
[00:42:13.623 --> 00:42:15.944]  You say, oh, well, the Antifa's not a threat, they're a bunch of wimps.
[00:42:15.944 --> 00:42:25.909]  No, they've got MS-13, they've got other criminal groups, they've got Hezbollah, now synced up with Obama and the deep state, and they plan on making a run at this country and civil war.
[00:42:25.909 --> 00:42:27.510]  Michael Savage, you're absolutely right.
[00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.011]  I want to talk to you when we come back.
[00:42:29.511 --> 00:42:33.492]  About how you think we can stop this, what Trump should do, but I think you just said it.
[00:42:33.492 --> 00:42:40.415]  We have to recognize this is the fight of our lives, America fighting for its life, and people better decide what they're going to do and whose side they're on.
[00:42:40.415 --> 00:42:42.576]  Is that what you're saying, Michael Savage?
[00:42:42.576 --> 00:42:45.276]  I'm saying they're not Antifa, they're Nazifa.
[00:42:45.276 --> 00:42:46.377]  Let's be very clear.
[00:42:46.377 --> 00:42:48.778]  Let's start using their tactics.
[00:42:48.778 --> 00:42:49.518]  They are racists.
[00:42:50.942 --> 00:42:55.364]  They are absolutely terroristic, and they are Nazi-fa.
[00:42:55.364 --> 00:42:56.665]  They're not the good guys.
[00:42:56.665 --> 00:42:58.406]  They wear the black hats.
[00:42:58.406 --> 00:43:03.548]  And this is what I spoke about at the private dinner at SavageNationLive.com.
[00:43:03.548 --> 00:43:06.270]  Let's talk about it right now with Michael Savage.
[00:43:08.004 --> 00:43:12.466]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[00:43:12.466 --> 00:43:14.387]  I don't care what your views are.
[00:43:14.387 --> 00:43:17.409]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[00:43:17.409 --> 00:43:18.169]  That's important.
[00:43:18.169 --> 00:43:19.790]  But we have something in common.
[00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:23.392]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[00:43:23.872 --> 00:43:31.078]  Clinton deep state bag man Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to Congress and the world.
[00:43:31.078 --> 00:43:36.842]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted.
[00:43:36.842 --> 00:43:41.265]  Word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[00:43:41.265 --> 00:43:43.027]  From my new home in New Zealand I will...
[00:43:45.938 --> 00:43:49.522]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[00:43:49.522 --> 00:43:51.424]  Not so fast, criminal.
[00:43:51.424 --> 00:43:55.328]  We're going to bring you to justice, and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[00:43:55.328 --> 00:44:00.153]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[00:44:00.153 --> 00:44:07.401]  But the American people know how much you hate us, and we're fighting back at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Ban.Video!

[00:45:09.574 --> 00:45:11.215]  The Alex Jones Show!
[00:45:39.514 --> 00:45:45.499]  The reason you take the high-quality, nutraceutical-grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant.
[00:45:45.499 --> 00:45:46.840]  It's why you're so alive.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:52.885]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age.
[00:45:52.885 --> 00:46:01.913]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself to know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion, are mentally retarded.
[00:46:02.353 --> 00:46:05.094]  On the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[00:46:05.094 --> 00:46:07.275]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[00:46:07.275 --> 00:46:13.898]  InfoWars.com The time has come to defy the Thought Police.
[00:46:13.898 --> 00:46:17.400]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.982]  They're waging war on communication itself.
[00:46:20.982 --> 00:46:27.705]  As the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[00:46:27.705 --> 00:46:30.106]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[00:46:30.686 --> 00:46:37.115]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[00:46:37.115 --> 00:46:44.204]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[00:46:44.204 --> 00:46:46.728]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[00:46:47.368 --> 00:46:51.610]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:55.531]  We have a it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap.
[00:46:55.531 --> 00:46:56.391]  It's black and white.
[00:46:56.391 --> 00:46:56.891]  Very nice.
[00:46:56.891 --> 00:46:58.352]  It has the okay symbol on it.
[00:46:58.352 --> 00:47:00.173]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[00:47:00.173 --> 00:47:02.173]  Infowars.com is on the back.
[00:47:02.173 --> 00:47:12.077]  Get yours today at infowarsstore.com and support free speech by supporting Infowars while having a great hat.
[00:47:12.077 --> 00:47:14.738]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:27.483 --> 00:47:34.408]  Thrashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:34.408 --> 00:47:38.790]  Well, the whole country, that means the whole world, is in the danger zone.
[00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:50.278]  And everybody overuses parallels to Hitler, but if you look at the anti-fascists, they are funded by a Nazi collaborator, they're against free speech, they are promoting race war in this country, they are the ultimate
[00:47:51.872 --> 00:47:53.373]  Modern version of the Nazis.
[00:47:53.373 --> 00:48:00.475]  Dr. Savage, who's a historian, botanist, you name it, and best-selling author, is not engaged in hyperbole here.
[00:48:00.475 --> 00:48:06.077]  You cannot understate how dangerous these people are, and who they represent, and how they're protected.
[00:48:06.077 --> 00:48:19.401]  Now, the mainstream media promotes them, and we have this letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote his daughter, that Ivanka Trump retweeted yesterday, surrounded by enemies and spies, catching and
[00:48:20.811 --> 00:48:27.821]  Perverting every word that falls from or flows from my pen and inventing where facts fail them.
[00:48:27.821 --> 00:48:29.224]  They're making their move.
[00:48:29.224 --> 00:48:31.287]  They admit they're making their move.
[00:48:31.287 --> 00:48:34.572]  And conservatives and nationalists and patriots better stop living in denial.
[00:48:36.223 --> 00:48:38.725]  Doesn't matter if it makes Trump more popular trying to impeach him.
[00:48:38.725 --> 00:48:55.957]  They're going for the jugular and two former CIA directors, Brennan and McLaughlin, on TV yesterday said, we're running this, we're proud of ourselves, our former adjuncts are the ones testifying, we're removing him, and Brennan had this psycho face like he was in a psycho movie.
[00:48:55.957 --> 00:48:59.700]  Dr. Michael Savage is with us right now pointing out the point we're at.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:01.381]  I want him to get into what he thinks we should do.
[00:49:02.202 --> 00:49:03.563]  What do you think Trump should do?
[00:49:03.563 --> 00:49:05.104]  Trump's announcing fireside chats.
[00:49:05.104 --> 00:49:05.845]  That's not enough.
[00:49:05.845 --> 00:49:09.868]  I think emergency messages to the public about... Fireside chat.
[00:49:09.868 --> 00:49:12.010]  Again, Alex, please.
[00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:13.311]  I've said this on my own show.
[00:49:13.311 --> 00:49:15.333]  I said it at the dinner the other night.
[00:49:15.333 --> 00:49:18.636]  Someone's misadvising the President on how to respond to these criminals.
[00:49:19.432 --> 00:49:22.293]  Stop with the nice guy and the fireside chats.
[00:49:22.293 --> 00:49:23.553]  He's not FDR.
[00:49:23.553 --> 00:49:24.994]  That's not his style.
[00:49:24.994 --> 00:49:26.454]  It's only going to make him look weak.
[00:49:26.454 --> 00:49:28.414]  He's got to look stronger, not weaker.
[00:49:28.414 --> 00:49:36.637]  And when the enemy tries to take you down, a guy like him, the last thing he should do is get weak and not worry about Jake Tapper.
[00:49:36.637 --> 00:49:37.817]  He's a low grade guy.
[00:49:37.817 --> 00:49:38.197]  I agree.
[00:49:38.197 --> 00:49:42.598]  So he should march into Schiff's secret committee and say, I'm the man being accused.
[00:49:42.598 --> 00:49:44.519]  I want to face my accuser!
[00:49:44.519 --> 00:49:45.399]  Well, that would be nice.
[00:49:46.562 --> 00:49:48.703]  I think Schiff should be taken out in handcuffs.
[00:49:48.703 --> 00:49:50.084]  Who the hell is he?
[00:49:50.084 --> 00:49:59.450]  Who is this low-grade lawyer that suddenly thinks he's the President of the United States or the consigliere to the crime family that wants to take over the United States?
[00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:08.355]  How long have I said on my show, and I saw this before it came out on the news today, that they're trying to decapitate the leadership so Pelosi can become President?
[00:50:08.975 --> 00:50:11.557]  I know people, oh that's crazy, I said it four weeks ago.
[00:50:11.557 --> 00:50:13.098]  Guess what we read this morning?
[00:50:13.098 --> 00:50:15.639]  We heard it on MSNBC yesterday.
[00:50:15.639 --> 00:50:21.203]  One of their stooges said, let's try to take down Trump and... CNN 2, ABC, Doctor, you must have missed it.
[00:50:21.203 --> 00:50:22.984]  It's now the new Talking Point.
[00:50:22.984 --> 00:50:24.525]  Well I said it four weeks ago.
[00:50:24.525 --> 00:50:26.606]  Of course, there's a fly in their ointment.
[00:50:27.442 --> 00:50:34.647]  Uh, which is that even if they did succeed in this, Trump gets to appoint the new vice president before he leaves, should he be removed.
[00:50:34.647 --> 00:50:42.172]  But they don't understand the niceties of parliamentarism, since they are authoritarians, and they don't understand anything but absolute power and greed.
[00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:44.414]  Look, we have a civil war in the country.
[00:50:44.414 --> 00:50:51.878]  There may not be a shooting civil war right now, they have started the civil war, we're in the civil war, and some of us know it, some of us don't know it.
[00:50:51.878 --> 00:50:53.640]  Eventually, we will all know it.
[00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.922]  And the criminals need to be exposed for their criminality.
[00:50:57.382 --> 00:51:00.024]  Now, again, I have to tell you why I'm on your show.
[00:51:00.024 --> 00:51:01.405]  You say, well, it's self-interest.
[00:51:01.405 --> 00:51:03.007]  Yes, it's self-interest.
[00:51:03.007 --> 00:51:07.931]  I did a show the other night in a private location in a club in San Francisco.
[00:51:07.931 --> 00:51:14.096]  And I did a videotape of it, which can be downloaded at SavageNationLive.com for probably the cost of a beer.
[00:51:14.096 --> 00:51:15.897]  It's not a moneymaker.
[00:51:15.897 --> 00:51:17.819]  It covers the cost of the dinner.
[00:51:19.031 --> 00:51:22.313]  The hundred people who were lucky enough to get in there heard the real savage.
[00:51:22.313 --> 00:51:24.394]  Most of it was humorous, incidentally.
[00:51:24.394 --> 00:51:25.615]  Alex, I used a lot of humor.
[00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:27.196]  You want to hear the opening line in the club?
[00:51:27.196 --> 00:51:29.658]  I do, but let me just stop you, because I'm going to stop you right now.
[00:51:29.658 --> 00:51:32.219]  The fact that you are, literally Trump wouldn't have got elected.
[00:51:32.219 --> 00:51:37.563]  We would have already lost if you hadn't been there, immobilizing people along with Matt Drudge and a few others, myself.
[00:51:37.563 --> 00:51:40.925]  I'm not trying to brag, but let's do credit where we should celebrate
[00:51:41.505 --> 00:51:43.247]  Well, I don't know about that.
[00:51:43.247 --> 00:51:43.607]  I know this.
[00:51:43.607 --> 00:51:47.530]  Trump put his arm around me shortly after he was elected at Mar-a-Lago, which was in December of that year.
[00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:48.952]  I went there, and he saw me.
[00:51:48.952 --> 00:51:50.033]  I went up to him.
[00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:11.102]  The Secret Service tried to keep me away and he waved him away.
[00:52:11.102 --> 00:52:12.945]  He was in the early days.
[00:52:12.945 --> 00:52:13.345]  No, no, no.
[00:52:13.345 --> 00:52:17.110]  He put his arm around me and loudly proclaimed I wouldn't be President without this man.
[00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:18.652]  It was a great moment.
[00:52:18.652 --> 00:52:20.234]  A really great moment.
[00:52:20.234 --> 00:52:24.180]  And you know, Alex, I had a hot dog with the President on Air Force One about four weeks ago.
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.582]  I've told this story over and over again.
[00:52:26.252 --> 00:52:31.995]  Even though I've been critical of many of his policies, and I have been, I'm not Sean Hannity.
[00:52:31.995 --> 00:52:34.877]  I never learned how to do shoe polish on my tongue.
[00:52:34.877 --> 00:52:38.960]  Maybe that's something he learned at his parents' knees.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:47.445]  I was taught to be independent, and I've criticized the president where I thought he was wrong, such as his abrupt withdrawal from Syria, and the emphasis on the word abrupt.
[00:52:47.445 --> 00:52:51.507]  I was surprised that I was even allowed near him, but he's a true gentleman.
[00:52:52.615 --> 00:52:56.377]  And not only a gentleman, but a very kind, sensitive man.
[00:52:56.377 --> 00:52:58.057]  I don't want to go into the details.
[00:52:58.057 --> 00:53:01.159]  The real Trump is very, very soft and smart.
[00:53:01.159 --> 00:53:03.359]  And I don't mean soft in a wimpy way.
[00:53:03.359 --> 00:53:04.840]  He's a human being.
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:09.302]  I mean, you saw it the way, just I saw it the way he offered me his food from his own plate.
[00:53:09.302 --> 00:53:10.882]  Which sounds odd, doesn't it?
[00:53:10.882 --> 00:53:13.003]  I don't know any other world leader who would do that.
[00:53:13.003 --> 00:53:16.965]  Because they're usually, they don't have a scintilla of humility in them.
[00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:28.399]  What I'm getting at is the man that I know and the man that most people know is the opposite of what the vermin in the media are portraying him as being.
[00:53:28.399 --> 00:53:33.123]  He is the least racist president I have remembered reading about.
[00:53:33.123 --> 00:53:42.511]  The things he has done, do you know that he was the first, I think one of the first, private club owners to open his club to LGBT people over the objections of many?
[00:53:43.393 --> 00:53:45.635]  People don't give him credit for what he actually is.
[00:53:45.635 --> 00:53:50.158]  Well, he was the first to open the clubs up to blacks and others, and he gets crapped on and lied about.
[00:53:50.158 --> 00:53:55.981]  But it scares them to have people like Kanye West coming out now and saying, we're getting off the Democrat plantation.
[00:53:55.981 --> 00:53:58.703]  I think that's why they're launching their attacks so hard.
[00:53:58.703 --> 00:54:01.505]  Why do you think the deep state is flipping out?
[00:54:01.505 --> 00:54:05.468]  I think it's because they know they're beginning to lose the culture war, Dr. Savage.
[00:54:07.281 --> 00:54:08.242]  What is the deep state?
[00:54:08.242 --> 00:54:09.685]  We used to call them something else.
[00:54:09.685 --> 00:54:10.326]  What do we call them?
[00:54:10.326 --> 00:54:11.307]  The establishment, right?
[00:54:11.307 --> 00:54:12.349]  Yes.
[00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:13.952]  Let's go back to the original word.
[00:54:13.952 --> 00:54:16.356]  The people who really run the show.
[00:54:16.356 --> 00:54:17.257]  The money people.
[00:54:17.257 --> 00:54:20.423]  The financial institutions who basically own the media.
[00:54:21.149 --> 00:54:22.610]  That would include Rupert Murdoch.
[00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:24.211]  I mean, let's not mince words here.
[00:54:24.211 --> 00:54:25.752]  Oh, Fox has gotten really bad.
[00:54:25.752 --> 00:54:34.076]  Yeah, they all bet on China, and they can't believe America, this horse, is coming back from behind at the end, so they're out there shooting at the horse so we don't win the damn race.
[00:54:34.076 --> 00:54:40.400]  So, the big money, the media money, etc., doesn't like the outsider.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:47.483]  Everyone in the media portrays Trump as part of the establishment, but that's the exact opposite of who he is.
[00:54:47.483 --> 00:54:49.204]  Yeah, McCain was the opposite of a maverick.
[00:54:49.204 --> 00:54:50.045]  Trump is a maverick.
[00:54:50.743 --> 00:54:52.703]  You could put it that way.
[00:54:52.703 --> 00:54:56.044]  I wonder, though, how any man can take this amount of hatred.
[00:54:56.044 --> 00:54:58.884]  This is the one thing we should talk about another time.
[00:54:58.884 --> 00:55:09.166]  The psychological pain, the psychological damage they are doing to this man is actually, it's inhuman.
[00:55:09.166 --> 00:55:10.146]  I don't know how he does it.
[00:55:10.146 --> 00:55:11.747]  I don't know how- Michael, you know how he does it.
[00:55:11.747 --> 00:55:13.947]  You've been attacked just as bad over the years.
[00:55:13.947 --> 00:55:17.128]  So have I. You do it because you know how evil they are.
[00:55:17.128 --> 00:55:19.408]  25 years, that's a quarter of a century of how to live in hiding.
[00:55:20.268 --> 00:55:21.909]  I have almost no friends.
[00:55:21.909 --> 00:55:22.590]  But you know what?
[00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:27.013]  It's a price I have chosen to pay for the job that God put me here to do.
[00:55:27.013 --> 00:55:28.955]  People say bullcrap, Savage.
[00:55:28.955 --> 00:55:30.536]  You're doing it for the money.
[00:55:30.536 --> 00:55:32.117]  Let me tell you something.
[00:55:32.117 --> 00:55:35.520]  I grew up poor and I have some money, which I earned every penny of.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.002]  I'm basically still a poor man with money.
[00:55:38.002 --> 00:55:39.703]  And so I still think like a poor man.
[00:55:39.963 --> 00:55:50.947]  Savage, let me, I've been stalking you for 20-something years, so I know you made your giant fortune in books and in trailblazing the whole modern supplement movement that we literally fund ourselves from.
[00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:56.308]  That's why I admire you, and that's why I am kissing your ass here on air, because you deserve it for what you've done.
[00:55:56.308 --> 00:55:57.409]  No, no, it's all true.
[00:55:57.409 --> 00:55:59.429]  I'm not getting down on your shoe polish.
[00:55:59.429 --> 00:56:00.470]  That may be toxic.
[00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:02.971]  You better be very careful and take another supplement.
[00:56:02.971 --> 00:56:03.631]  But look, Alex,
[00:56:04.191 --> 00:56:05.432]  I like to joke around a lot.
[00:56:05.432 --> 00:56:08.554]  I gotta give you the opening line to this show to make everyone happy.
[00:56:08.554 --> 00:56:08.914]  You ready?
[00:56:08.914 --> 00:56:11.215]  It's at SavageNationLine.com.
[00:56:11.215 --> 00:56:13.777]  Okay, so I walk into the club, people cheer.
[00:56:13.777 --> 00:56:15.798]  Some of them knew me, most didn't.
[00:56:15.798 --> 00:56:18.699]  I was like a freak coming into this private liberal club.
[00:56:18.699 --> 00:56:23.242]  Many paid to just see me talk and they got a dinner for a very, very low price.
[00:56:23.242 --> 00:56:28.225]  So as Groucho Marx said, I would never join a club that would have me as a member.
[00:56:28.225 --> 00:56:30.246]  I said, now look around and you'll see why he was right.
[00:56:31.411 --> 00:56:35.614]  That was a funny line on Private Club where I was a member, don't you think?
[00:56:35.614 --> 00:56:36.775]  Absolutely, it was very good.
[00:56:36.775 --> 00:56:37.656]  It's hilarious.
[00:56:37.656 --> 00:56:40.258]  Okay, so what I'm saying is I made it very light.
[00:56:40.258 --> 00:56:52.328]  I used my God-given sense of humor to bridge, bridge the hard right, the hard left, the hard realities from the hard lies.
[00:56:52.328 --> 00:56:56.031]  I try to use humor, which is the greatest leavening agent, Alex.
[00:56:56.031 --> 00:56:59.334]  I don't know that there's room for humor in this age of mass hysteria.
[00:57:00.071 --> 00:57:04.293]  This age of mass hysteria right now is at a fever pitch.
[00:57:04.293 --> 00:57:07.855]  All the left knows is lies, deceit, and hate.
[00:57:07.855 --> 00:57:10.356]  And the one behind it all is who?
[00:57:10.356 --> 00:57:12.256]  Who is the one behind it all?
[00:57:12.256 --> 00:57:13.717]  Oh, we could say Soros.
[00:57:13.717 --> 00:57:15.658]  Oh, we could say Pelosi's gang.
[00:57:15.658 --> 00:57:17.299]  It's us letting them do it.
[00:57:17.299 --> 00:57:18.639]  Who is it, though?
[00:57:18.639 --> 00:57:19.260]  Who is it?
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:19.500]  Who is it?
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:20.120]  The devil.
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:20.680]  Who is it?
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.621]  Who's behind this?
[00:57:21.621 --> 00:57:22.161]  Satan's real.
[00:57:23.487 --> 00:57:28.050]  Well, even if it's a metaphor, it's as real as Pelosi's tongue.
[00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:33.694]  Even if Satan is a metaphor, it's as real as... Hey, Dr. Savage, I know you've got to go, but this is a two-minute break.
[00:57:33.694 --> 00:57:41.719]  You've got to do five more minutes and give President Trump solutions, because I know he tunes into my show, he tunes into what you do, so I'm drafting you.
[00:57:41.719 --> 00:57:43.920]  Stay there two minutes, we'll be right back with Michael Savage.
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:44.761]  I have the solution.
[00:57:45.641 --> 00:57:46.062]  Stay there.
[00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:48.467]  We want the solution on the other side, folks.
[00:57:48.467 --> 00:57:49.449]  An incredible time.
[00:57:49.449 --> 00:57:51.072]  MichaelSavage.com.
[00:57:51.072 --> 00:57:53.336]  I know I'm gonna go watch his piece tonight.
[00:57:53.336 --> 00:57:54.959]  And thank you all for your support of InfoWars, folks.
[00:57:54.959 --> 00:57:55.800]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[00:57:58.021 --> 00:57:59.042]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[00:57:59.042 --> 00:58:00.103]  Hey Alex!
[00:58:00.103 --> 00:58:01.484]  Oh my God!
[00:58:01.484 --> 00:58:04.286]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[00:58:04.286 --> 00:58:06.888]  Look, in January 2016 I went in a hospital.
[00:58:06.888 --> 00:58:10.731]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June.
[00:58:10.731 --> 00:58:14.374]  And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[00:58:14.374 --> 00:58:15.195]  Let me tell you something, man.
[00:58:15.755 --> 00:58:23.177]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[00:58:23.177 --> 00:58:24.937]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[00:58:24.937 --> 00:58:28.899]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[00:58:28.899 --> 00:58:31.279]  I'm gonna get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[00:58:31.279 --> 00:58:34.240]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.342]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[00:58:36.342 --> 00:58:36.882]  I got it.
[00:58:36.882 --> 00:58:38.243]  I hid it from the nurses.
[00:58:38.243 --> 00:58:39.304]  I started taking it.
[00:58:39.304 --> 00:58:41.706]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[00:58:41.706 --> 00:58:42.747]  It saved my life.
[00:58:42.747 --> 00:58:52.216]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't care if you've traveled over, anybody's traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that Living Defense.
[00:58:52.216 --> 00:58:52.917]  It's true, folks.
[00:58:52.917 --> 00:58:55.959]  We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality.
[00:58:55.959 --> 00:58:57.561]  And Living Defense is over-the-top good.
[00:59:00.642 --> 00:59:04.323]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[00:59:04.323 --> 00:59:12.305]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[00:59:12.305 --> 00:59:14.886]  It's just that simple.
[00:59:14.886 --> 00:59:21.288]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[00:59:21.288 --> 00:59:21.808]  Others like
[00:59:22.388 --> 00:59:24.489]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[00:59:24.489 --> 00:59:25.210]  Get both.
[00:59:25.210 --> 00:59:26.670]  They're both great for you.
[00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:31.093]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[00:59:31.093 --> 00:59:33.294]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[00:59:33.294 --> 00:59:34.654]  That's why I harp on it.
[00:59:34.654 --> 00:59:38.817]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[00:59:38.817 --> 00:59:42.078]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long.
[00:59:42.078 --> 00:59:42.819]  It's simple.
[00:59:42.819 --> 00:59:47.061]  Get your high quality iodine at InfoWarsTore.com and help fund the InfoWar.
[00:59:47.401 --> 00:59:49.522]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:49.522 --> 00:59:52.204]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[00:59:52.204 --> 00:59:54.025]  It's the iodine challenge.
[00:59:54.025 --> 01:00:01.509]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[01:00:01.509 --> 01:00:04.151]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:10.965 --> 01:00:15.838]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:00:15.838 --> 01:00:17.321]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.709 --> 01:00:23.531]  Alright, five more minutes with Michael Savage and I'm opening the phones up.
[01:00:23.531 --> 01:00:26.152]  The coup against the President in America is live.
[01:00:26.152 --> 01:00:28.233]  Globalist forces are funding it.
[01:00:28.233 --> 01:00:29.934]  John Brennan is quarterbacking it.
[01:00:29.934 --> 01:00:32.796]  Obama's minion voted for the Communist Party twice.
[01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:35.358]  Joined the Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia as a convert.
[01:00:35.358 --> 01:00:36.198]  That is confirmed.
[01:00:36.198 --> 01:00:40.161]  I just heard that ten years ago and it's since he's given interviews and admitted all of that.
[01:00:40.161 --> 01:00:40.621]  Unbelievable.
[01:00:41.141 --> 01:00:44.642]  Michael Savage, ladies and gentlemen, is here with us for five more minutes.
[01:00:44.642 --> 01:00:46.283]  MichaelSavage.com.
[01:00:46.283 --> 01:00:54.206]  And I just can't stand it, quite frankly, when somebody like him goes, hey, I'm sorry, I'm promoting this speech I gave, and, you know, it pays for putting the event on.
[01:00:54.206 --> 01:00:55.987]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're trying to bankrupt InfoWars.
[01:00:56.747 --> 01:00:58.068]  We used to have extra money to do stuff.
[01:00:58.068 --> 01:00:59.509]  I haven't been paid in over a year and a half.
[01:00:59.509 --> 01:01:00.489]  I don't care about that.
[01:01:00.489 --> 01:01:02.130]  But I want money to keep fighting.
[01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:04.232]  They're shutting everybody down.
[01:01:04.232 --> 01:01:08.714]  So we need to patronize and support the people telling the truth.
[01:01:08.714 --> 01:01:10.215]  And I know you're doing it, folks.
[01:01:10.215 --> 01:01:13.237]  So whether it's Michael Savage or Infowars, they took all our sponsors.
[01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:14.518]  His show was top-rated everywhere.
[01:01:14.518 --> 01:01:16.860]  They went and got his sponsors to try to take him off the air.
[01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:18.000]  And he's not going to whine about it.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.361]  He keeps fighting.
[01:01:19.361 --> 01:01:20.722]  So it's a mirror reaction.
[01:01:20.722 --> 01:01:21.923]  He says, why does Trump keep fighting?
[01:01:22.623 --> 01:01:24.244]  Savage asks, how do you keep doing it?
[01:01:24.244 --> 01:01:25.345]  The same damn reason!
[01:01:25.345 --> 01:01:27.967]  These people are pissing all over me and attacking me!
[01:01:27.967 --> 01:01:29.067]  I can't give up!
[01:01:29.067 --> 01:01:32.049]  And it proves how bad they are and makes me fight harder, quite frankly.
[01:01:32.049 --> 01:01:34.691]  I thrive off of it, like the President says.
[01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.192]  Michael Savage, thanks for staying with us.
[01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:37.933]  You've got four minutes.
[01:01:37.933 --> 01:01:39.294]  What does the President need to do?
[01:01:39.294 --> 01:01:43.557]  Your message to Trump and your message to America and the world.
[01:01:43.557 --> 01:01:48.380]  Well, my tweet is, do what they're doing to him.
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.340]  I'm saying this.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:50.101]  Here's what I say.
[01:01:50.101 --> 01:01:51.862]  Attacks on Trump based on racism.
[01:01:52.495 --> 01:01:59.958]  He is the symbol of white males, heterosexual, Christian people.
[01:01:59.958 --> 01:02:09.881]  Here we had the first mixed-race president, Barack Obama, who did at least 20 different scandalous things, some of which were impeachable.
[01:02:09.881 --> 01:02:20.125]  Whether it was the IRS targeting Obama's enemies, that was more impeachable than the alleged withholding of funds from Ukraine, which is a laugh altogether.
[01:02:21.087 --> 01:02:23.628]  There was the IRS targeting Obama's enemies.
[01:02:23.628 --> 01:02:25.368]  There was Benghazi.
[01:02:25.368 --> 01:02:29.789]  There was the VA hospital scandal where people were dying in the hall.
[01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:31.870]  There was the Solyndra scandal.
[01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:33.910]  Tie that into Pelosi's family.
[01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:35.951]  Anyone know the connection?
[01:02:35.951 --> 01:02:38.171]  I can give you all of the others.
[01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:42.132]  Now, Obama's no longer president, so that's not the right track to take.
[01:02:42.132 --> 01:02:43.073]  It's a point of illustration.
[01:02:45.445 --> 01:02:55.248]  Of how this operates, which is the media is 100% racist towards white people, and it's mainly run by white people, which of course is the game.
[01:02:55.248 --> 01:02:56.408]  That's how they get away with it.
[01:02:56.408 --> 01:02:59.149]  They make believe that they're not one of them, you get it?
[01:02:59.149 --> 01:03:00.489]  To keep them away from their doors.
[01:03:00.489 --> 01:03:07.851]  That's why a woman like Nancy Pelosi has the nerve to give speeches at valedictorian speeches at Berkeley and say, be a disruptor.
[01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:08.811]  You hear this?
[01:03:08.811 --> 01:03:12.132]  A billionaire who lives on top of Pacific Heights with armed security guards
[01:03:12.964 --> 01:03:14.264]  Says be a disruptor.
[01:03:14.264 --> 01:03:14.745]  You hear this?
[01:03:14.745 --> 01:03:17.886]  A city where people crap in the streets while you're eating in a restaurant.
[01:03:17.886 --> 01:03:19.606]  And I'm told she doesn't even use a car.
[01:03:19.606 --> 01:03:27.629]  She flies to the- I was in a restaurant in her backyard not too long ago and as I'm eating I look out a man drops his pants and defecates on the sidewalk.
[01:03:27.629 --> 01:03:28.910]  It's not a laughing matter.
[01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:32.851]  It's an example of what a liar she is and so is Feinstein.
[01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.231]  This is in their own city.
[01:03:34.231 --> 01:03:35.992]  They can't manage their own city.
[01:03:35.992 --> 01:03:41.554]  Gavin Newsom can't even keep the lights on in his own state and yet he's one of the chief champions of impeach Trump.
[01:03:42.074 --> 01:03:52.782]  If people can't figure it out, that Democrats can't manage a goddamn thing, they can't even keep the damn lights on, and we kept hearing, oh, it's going to become like Venezuela.
[01:03:52.782 --> 01:04:00.507]  More people were without power in the state of California under this Democrat machine than have ever been without power in Venezuela.
[01:04:00.507 --> 01:04:08.753]  It's fallen below the level of Venezuela under this corrupt machine in the state of California, which is ruled by, somewhat ruled by, Pelosi and Feinstein.
[01:04:08.753 --> 01:04:10.795]  I'm sure there are others behind it, but the fact is,
[01:04:11.355 --> 01:04:15.540]  Take a look at their mismanagement and you'll understand why they're going after Trump.
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.825]  A number of reasons, primarily because they want to cover up their own corruption.
[01:04:21.718 --> 01:04:25.099]  Wow, you are on fire and it's been too long since you've been back on.
[01:04:25.099 --> 01:04:29.120]  Please, anytime you want to have an extra rant or two.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.060]  Alex, I'm exhausted.
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.961]  I was up for four nights because of the blackout.
[01:04:31.961 --> 01:04:34.522]  I had to do a live event after a live show.
[01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:36.762]  I'm a young guy, but there's only so much anyone could do.
[01:04:36.762 --> 01:04:45.005]  I did the show the other night, SavageNationLive.com, and it's a stand-up routine that was called Life as a Conservative in Liberal San Francisco.
[01:04:45.005 --> 01:04:45.665]  A lot of humor.
[01:04:46.351 --> 01:04:48.894]  But a lot of very serious stuff mixed in.
[01:04:48.894 --> 01:04:50.435]  I hope I hit the mark.
[01:04:50.435 --> 01:04:51.637]  Hey, you've got me hooked.
[01:04:51.637 --> 01:04:53.158]  I'm gonna watch it tonight.
[01:04:53.158 --> 01:04:54.239]  Thank you, Michael Savage.
[01:04:54.239 --> 01:04:59.645]  Please come back again soon to report on the fall of California, which I know is a great state you love, but so sad.
[01:04:59.645 --> 01:05:01.387]  Thank you for reporting from hell on earth.
[01:05:01.387 --> 01:05:03.649]  Michael Savage, Godspeed.
[01:05:03.649 --> 01:05:04.610]  Keep fighting, Alex.
[01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:05.451]  You're the gladiator.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.741]  All of our bodies are different.
[01:05:09.741 --> 01:05:12.543]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[01:05:12.543 --> 01:05:15.544]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:21.228]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something you don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[01:05:22.302 --> 01:05:31.393]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life completely changes.
[01:05:31.393 --> 01:05:32.154]  I'm healthier.
[01:05:32.154 --> 01:05:33.495]  I have more energy.
[01:05:33.495 --> 01:05:34.316]  I lose weight.
[01:05:34.316 --> 01:05:35.097]  I look better.
[01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:36.659]  Everybody notices.
[01:05:36.659 --> 01:05:39.342]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit
[01:05:40.203 --> 01:05:43.944]  To take X2 Body's Ultimate Turmeric.
[01:05:43.944 --> 01:05:49.006]  I'm gonna commit to flush my gut out with the Gut Fusion from M4's Life.
[01:05:49.006 --> 01:05:53.928]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[01:05:53.928 --> 01:05:59.309]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about, is Gut Fusion.
[01:05:59.309 --> 01:06:00.410]  Folks, check it out.
[01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:02.351]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:06:02.351 --> 01:06:03.331]  50% off right now.
[01:06:03.331 --> 01:06:04.871]  The sale's about to end.
[01:06:04.871 --> 01:06:05.632]  Gut Fusion, m4store.com.
[01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:27.124]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:27.124 --> 01:06:33.928]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I promised to take a lot of calls today.
[01:06:33.928 --> 01:06:41.592]  And I promised to get the calls the first hour, but the producer reminded me after the show, she said, you know, we got Michael Savage on tomorrow.
[01:06:41.592 --> 01:06:44.134]  Would have been on today, but he was under the weather.
[01:06:45.862 --> 01:06:46.182]  Yes, sir.
[01:07:08.965 --> 01:07:23.451]  It's that they're trying to make it go into a shooting war, and Trump needs to march into Schiff's fake hearing as the president, as the person being accused, and demand to face his accusers.
[01:07:23.451 --> 01:07:31.034]  Coming up, I'm going to go over who these whistleblowers are, which is, again, we knew, the direct aides of Brennan, Clapper, Obama, and Hillary.
[01:07:33.407 --> 01:07:35.288]  And it turns out they tried to change the transcripts.
[01:07:35.288 --> 01:07:39.631]  Witnesses have said that the normal transcript, people said, this is the transcript, give me the transcript.
[01:07:39.631 --> 01:07:43.894]  The Ukrainian colonel and others, give me the transcript, I will change it for you.
[01:07:43.894 --> 01:07:52.079]  They've got orders to set the president up and they think his word against all the other witnesses and the transcripts of him talking to the Ukrainian president.
[01:07:52.079 --> 01:07:56.822]  You think Trump would go, I'm a businessman and you give me something for something.
[01:07:56.822 --> 01:07:58.463]  He never talks like that.
[01:07:59.943 --> 01:08:02.164]  That's unbelievable.
[01:08:02.164 --> 01:08:04.504]  That's how the Democrat crooks talk.
[01:08:04.504 --> 01:08:11.986]  Five senators, one of them's dead, McCain, are on record saying, you do what we want or we'll cut back the money.
[01:08:11.986 --> 01:08:16.447]  The Vice President, Biden's on TV!
[01:08:16.447 --> 01:08:27.650]  Going, listen, you fire that son of a bitch, that's a quote, who's investigating my son, which was a bad man for him, or we're holding back the billion dollars, and that son of a bitch was fired that night!
[01:08:31.343 --> 01:08:42.293]  And he said that from the Council on Foreign Relations on C-SPAN, the same group that had a meeting with Brennan and McLaughlin, both former CIA directors, saying, we're removing the president.
[01:08:42.293 --> 01:08:43.835]  Thank God for the deep state.
[01:08:43.835 --> 01:08:45.396]  We're glad we're getting rid of them.
[01:08:45.396 --> 01:08:50.822]  Those are quotes!
[01:08:50.822 --> 01:08:56.187]  So they can have their corrupt media hype all their zombie followers to try to physically attack
[01:08:57.898 --> 01:09:02.742]  Myself, the Trump family, Michael Savage, anybody that's known to be a patriot.
[01:09:02.742 --> 01:09:08.106]  And then they can't believe when I go, when they come over and bump me and I get up and I go, touch me again, I'm gonna beat the living hell out of you.
[01:09:08.106 --> 01:09:10.668]  And then a couple guys, let's go then!
[01:09:10.668 --> 01:09:12.329]  Start swinging!
[01:09:12.329 --> 01:09:15.612]  Just make sure you swing first, cuz I'm gonna punch you right in the throat.
[01:09:15.612 --> 01:09:21.557]  And when they're fishing that tracheotomy down your throat in that ambulance, if you're lucky, you'll just remember.
[01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:26.821]  When they go review the tape, you hit me first, and I'm gonna knock you into next week.
[01:09:26.821 --> 01:09:27.201]  Believe me.
[01:09:29.818 --> 01:09:34.960]  I am so sick of talking about you, scum.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:41.882]  Believe me, I'm not a talker.
[01:09:41.882 --> 01:09:47.404]  But I'm trying to mobilize people to fix this peacefully.
[01:09:47.404 --> 01:09:48.445]  You heard Savage.
[01:09:48.445 --> 01:09:49.465]  We're in a war.
[01:09:49.465 --> 01:09:51.426]  They're coming for everybody.
[01:09:51.426 --> 01:09:54.047]  They want to round us all up.
[01:09:54.047 --> 01:09:55.007]  You heard he had a bunch of
[01:09:56.078 --> 01:10:10.428]  Special Operations people at his event in San Francisco, and they said, no, we've been exposed where we live, where we work by government employees that are feeding Antifa, and they are targeting people just in general.
[01:10:10.428 --> 01:10:21.536]  If you're in ICE, or you're in the FBI, or you are in Delta Force, or you're in CIL Team 6, or any of that stuff, you have been identified in a database.
[01:10:21.536 --> 01:10:25.339]  Hell, Obama gave the CHICOMS, the Office of Personnel Management, hack.
[01:10:26.274 --> 01:10:28.455]  He completely sold us out!
[01:10:28.455 --> 01:10:33.258]  The Chi-Coms are quarterbacking this with Dianne Feinstein.
[01:10:33.258 --> 01:10:35.019]  You just heard Savage talk about it.
[01:10:35.019 --> 01:10:42.084]  There's no limit to the level they won't go.
[01:10:42.084 --> 01:10:46.146]  This is it.
[01:10:46.146 --> 01:10:47.847]  You just heard Savage.
[01:10:47.847 --> 01:10:52.490]  Trump's in deep trouble.
[01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:54.331]  Because he is good.
[01:10:54.331 --> 01:10:54.911]  Drudge.
[01:10:54.911 --> 01:10:55.892]  Trump's in deep trouble.
[01:10:57.503 --> 01:11:00.305]  So that Trump will stop listening.
[01:11:00.305 --> 01:11:03.708]  Alex Jones, Trump's in deep trouble.
[01:11:03.708 --> 01:11:05.490]  The blood's already in the water.
[01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:09.153]  So that Trump will get aggressive.
[01:11:09.153 --> 01:11:11.475]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:11:11.475 --> 01:11:19.582]  My ass and America's ass, your ass, your children's ass, the world's ass, is hanging out with President Trump.
[01:11:19.582 --> 01:11:20.323]  I love him to death.
[01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:27.153]  Love him like a son, a father, a family member.
[01:11:27.153 --> 01:11:38.782]  And when you see somebody doing something you care about that isn't going to turn out good, you get pissed at them.
[01:11:38.782 --> 01:11:44.847]  And I don't like having to start thinking about the physical end of this stuff.
[01:11:44.847 --> 01:11:46.709]  Because I'm not scared.
[01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:49.932]  And my brain starts, that part of my brain starts
[01:11:51.428 --> 01:12:02.760]  Talking, and the voice gets bigger, and it's smart, and it's mean, and it knows what to do, and it's done it for generations, and it's just waiting to be turned loose.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.724]  Begging to be turned loose.
[01:12:06.724 --> 01:12:10.488]  The satisfaction of just good clean fun.
[01:12:13.885 --> 01:12:27.090]  And you watch those devil worshippers simulating murdering babies, and you watch the pedophiles openly parading with our children and laughing that they've captured our standard because they have captured our standard.
[01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:41.957]  And they're trying to invoke us into war with them because they're losing the information war, and they know it, so they're uncloaking themselves now, hoping we go into a physical confrontation, and we don't want that.
[01:12:41.957 --> 01:12:42.857]  But here's the problem.
[01:12:45.029 --> 01:12:51.790]  They're going to stage more mass shootings with their Antifa operatives.
[01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:55.391]  And they're going to blame them on us.
[01:12:55.391 --> 01:12:57.251]  And they're going to try to kill the President.
[01:12:57.251 --> 01:12:58.631]  And they're going to pull a lot of other stuff.
[01:12:58.631 --> 01:13:02.772]  And so, we have to be honest about the world we're entering.
[01:13:02.772 --> 01:13:09.833]  And... There's something else very key here.
[01:13:09.833 --> 01:13:12.894]  You have to understand that Pelosi and Schiff are all just slaves.
[01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:15.799]  They don't call the shots.
[01:13:15.799 --> 01:13:24.244]  They have the deep state behind people like Brennan, threatening them with scandals in jail time if they don't do this.
[01:13:24.244 --> 01:13:25.725]  Pelosi was shaking when she did it.
[01:13:25.725 --> 01:13:26.806]  She knows it's criminal.
[01:13:26.806 --> 01:13:29.728]  She can barely talk.
[01:13:29.728 --> 01:13:33.791]  They don't know what to do.
[01:13:33.791 --> 01:13:37.453]  And that's it.
[01:13:37.453 --> 01:13:39.414]  And they're scared.
[01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:40.435]  They're put there because they're weak.
[01:13:44.377 --> 01:13:47.239]  This is all an intimidation game.
[01:13:47.239 --> 01:13:49.380]  We just want prosperity, but the globalists don't.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:57.925]  I'm going to go to break, come back with these clips, think of the number, take your calls, a lot of them today on this, what you think we should do, where it's all going, just how amazing these epic times are.
[01:13:57.925 --> 01:14:09.532]  Please, I didn't even plug last hour, and that's how we fund ourselves, and we are not in the black to continue through the election at the level we're at.
[01:14:11.354 --> 01:14:12.615]  I need funds.
[01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:14.856]  I've got a lot of projects I want to do.
[01:14:14.856 --> 01:14:27.322]  I know that we could do a lot of things that are, that we could trigger dominoes that could mortally wound, at this stage, the globalist operation.
[01:14:27.322 --> 01:14:40.809]  I mean, we've already, you've already hurt them bad through this weapon system that projects the truth, unapologetically, with extreme force and will and anger, but projected through love for our children.
[01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:45.891]  And the enemy wants this system shut down.
[01:14:45.891 --> 01:14:48.912]  They failed because you've been amplifying it.
[01:14:48.912 --> 01:14:50.652]  But I don't want you to think of yourself as a caboose.
[01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:53.873]  You are the engine.
[01:14:53.873 --> 01:14:59.174]  You are the thunderbolt that falls from heaven.
[01:14:59.174 --> 01:15:00.375]  You are the resistance.
[01:15:00.375 --> 01:15:01.255]  You are the leadership.
[01:15:01.255 --> 01:15:03.596]  You are everything we need.
[01:15:03.596 --> 01:15:04.916]  So the word of mouth, the prayer,
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.221]  And the finances.
[01:15:10.221 --> 01:15:11.201]  And we make it so easy.
[01:15:11.201 --> 01:15:13.542]  You want Wake Up America Coffee.
[01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:14.722]  It's excellent.
[01:15:14.722 --> 01:15:18.503]  Then you want to sign up for AutoShip so you get 10% off and keep getting it, cancelling time.
[01:15:18.503 --> 01:15:20.044]  You want our toothpaste.
[01:15:20.044 --> 01:15:21.944]  No additives.
[01:15:21.944 --> 01:15:22.504]  No fillers.
[01:15:22.504 --> 01:15:26.546]  It's nothing but the high quality systems that are healthy with a little silver and iodine.
[01:15:26.546 --> 01:15:27.006]  People love it.
[01:15:28.086 --> 01:15:30.489]  People say a tiny little dot works.
[01:15:30.489 --> 01:15:31.210]  Why is it clean so well?
[01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:32.171]  Why are my gums so healthy?
[01:15:32.171 --> 01:15:34.253]  Just because it doesn't have the garbage.
[01:15:34.253 --> 01:15:35.975]  That's there.
[01:15:35.975 --> 01:15:39.399]  The turmeric, all the products, a bunch of stuff like DNA Force Plus is back in stock.
[01:15:39.399 --> 01:15:40.921]  A lot of things are selling out.
[01:15:40.921 --> 01:15:42.443]  Everything must go.
[01:15:42.443 --> 01:15:43.984]  Mega Sale has to end by Monday.

[01:15:48.126 --> 01:15:55.755]  And a lot of stuff is selling out, like Living Defense and like the other great products like Ultra 12.

[01:16:07.585 --> 01:16:08.885]  Maybe not tomorrow.

[01:16:35.802 --> 01:16:42.147]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:42.147 --> 01:16:45.190]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:51.134]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:51.134 --> 01:16:54.917]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:54.917 --> 01:16:56.178]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:57.520]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:03.725]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:17:03.725 --> 01:17:05.166]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:17:06.081 --> 01:17:08.043]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:17:08.043 --> 01:17:13.346]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:13.346 --> 01:17:14.928]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:14.928 --> 01:17:23.294]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:23.294 --> 01:17:28.978]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:17:29.138 --> 01:17:30.979]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:33.121]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:33.121 --> 01:17:37.644]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:37.644 --> 01:17:39.825]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:17:39.825 --> 01:17:47.671]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:17:53.912 --> 01:17:55.553]  The time has come to defy the Thought Police.
[01:18:11.465 --> 01:18:14.948]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[01:18:14.948 --> 01:18:25.277]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[01:18:25.277 --> 01:18:27.660]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:34.668]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:41.756]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[01:18:41.756 --> 01:18:44.279]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[01:18:44.919 --> 01:18:49.182]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[01:18:49.182 --> 01:18:53.085]  We have a it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap.
[01:18:53.085 --> 01:18:53.946]  It's black and white.
[01:18:53.946 --> 01:18:54.446]  Very nice.
[01:18:54.446 --> 01:18:55.907]  It has the okay symbol on it.
[01:18:55.907 --> 01:18:57.749]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[01:18:57.749 --> 01:18:59.750]  Infowars.com is on the back.
[01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:05.715]  Get yours today at infowarsstore.com and support free speech by supporting InfoWars while having a great hat.
[01:19:06.727 --> 01:19:11.193]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[01:19:11.193 --> 01:19:13.116]  I don't care what your views are.
[01:19:13.116 --> 01:19:16.120]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:16.901]  That's important.
[01:19:16.901 --> 01:19:18.524]  But we have something in common.
[01:19:18.524 --> 01:19:22.129]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[01:19:22.589 --> 01:19:29.812]  Clinton deep state bag man Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to Congress and the world.
[01:19:29.812 --> 01:19:35.554]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted.
[01:19:35.554 --> 01:19:39.975]  Word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:41.696]  From my new home in New Zealand I will
[01:19:44.652 --> 01:19:48.235]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[01:19:48.235 --> 01:19:50.157]  Not so fast, criminal!
[01:19:50.157 --> 01:19:54.060]  We're going to bring you to justice, and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:58.863]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[01:19:58.863 --> 01:20:10.593]  But the American people know how much you hate us, and we're fighting back at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Ban.Video!
[01:20:10.593 --> 01:20:13.235]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.202 --> 01:20:42.448]  Satan is real Working in spirit You can see him and hear him In this world every day Satan is real Working with power He can tempt you and lead
[01:20:47.979 --> 01:20:51.741]  I attended service at a little church in the country not long ago.
[01:20:51.741 --> 01:21:01.467]  A prayer was led by an old country preacher who then raised his hands as everyone stood and sang, My God is Real.
[01:21:01.467 --> 01:21:07.550]  A warm breeze through the open windows brought in the smell of new mown hay in a nearby field.
[01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:14.314]  And the singing of birds could be heard in the moment of silence as the preacher opened his Bible to read.
[01:21:14.314 --> 01:21:16.956]  And then, a little old man stood up
[01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:26.938]  Bent with age, his hair thin and white, and said, Preacher, tell them that Satan is real too.
[01:21:26.938 --> 01:21:33.223]  You can hear him in songs that give praise to idols and sinful things of this world.
[01:21:33.223 --> 01:21:37.325]  You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart.
[01:21:38.506 --> 01:21:43.410]  I know that Satan is real, for once I had a happy home.
[01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:46.753]  I was loved and respected by my family.
[01:21:46.753 --> 01:21:50.376]  I was looked upon as a leader in my community.
[01:21:50.376 --> 01:21:53.479]  And then, Satan came into my life.
[01:21:54.648 --> 01:21:57.530]  I grew selfish and unlaborly.
[01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:59.891]  My friends turned against me.
[01:21:59.891 --> 01:22:03.593]  And finally, my home was broken apart.
[01:22:03.593 --> 01:22:07.755]  My children took their paths into a world of sin.
[01:22:07.755 --> 01:22:12.498]  Yes, preacher, it's sweet to know that God is real.
[01:22:12.498 --> 01:22:16.420]  And to know that in Him all things are possible.
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:20.923]  And we know that heaven is a real place where joys shall never end.
[01:22:22.153 --> 01:22:28.476]  But sinner friend, if you're here today, Satan is real too.
[01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:31.517]  And hell is a real place.
[01:22:31.517 --> 01:22:34.698]  A place of everlasting punishment.
[01:22:34.698 --> 01:22:36.239]  That is the Loving Brothers.
[01:22:36.239 --> 01:22:45.263]  I thought we'd play that for TV viewers, specifically with the tranny, the man dressed up as a demon, calling himself a woman, simulating the murder of a baby.
[01:22:45.263 --> 01:22:47.984]  But don't worry, we've got all these states passing laws to kill babies after they're born.
[01:22:48.683 --> 01:22:52.024]  That's the left answer to saying you won't kill babies before they're born.
[01:22:52.024 --> 01:22:54.124]  Well, we'll just kill them after.
[01:22:54.124 --> 01:22:55.825]  See how you like that?
[01:22:55.825 --> 01:22:59.726]  And here's Hillary Clinton on with Trevor Noah.
[01:22:59.726 --> 01:23:02.166]  Asked about, well, you know, they've come out with the autopsy.
[01:23:02.166 --> 01:23:05.887]  Jeffrey Epstein, the pedophile trafficker for Hillary.
[01:23:05.887 --> 01:23:07.148]  That's right.
[01:23:07.148 --> 01:23:11.309]  Her foundation had got caught smuggling kids out of Haiti that were getting killed as well.
[01:23:11.309 --> 01:23:14.070]  Well, she thought it was really funny.
[01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:15.650]  So here, here is the demon laughing.
[01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:21.195]  How did you kill Jeffrey Epstein?
[01:23:21.195 --> 01:23:30.022]  Because you're not in power, but you have all the power.
[01:23:30.022 --> 01:23:33.785]  I really need to understand how you do what you do.
[01:23:33.785 --> 01:23:41.692]  Because you seem to be behind everything nefarious, and yet you do not use it to become president.
[01:23:41.692 --> 01:23:44.034]  What is the game plan?
[01:23:44.034 --> 01:23:44.595]  Well, Trevor...
[01:23:47.191 --> 01:23:51.290]  But honestly though, what does it feel like being the boogeyman of the right?
[01:23:52.302 --> 01:23:56.305]  Well, it's a constant surprise to me.
[01:23:56.305 --> 01:23:57.065]  Oh yeah!
[01:23:57.065 --> 01:24:15.578]  Because the things they say, and now of course it's on steroids with being online, are so ridiculous, beyond any imagination that I could have, and yet they are so persistent in putting forth these crazy ideas and theories.
[01:24:15.578 --> 01:24:19.481]  Honestly, I don't know what I ever did to get them so upset.
[01:24:20.805 --> 01:24:26.008]  I don't know what I ever did to get them so upset.
[01:24:26.008 --> 01:24:33.312]  She took out of college a job defending pedophiles specifically that had brutally raped little girls until their guts came out.
[01:24:33.312 --> 01:24:36.234]  I don't want to be gross, but I've had the women in the studio.
[01:24:36.234 --> 01:24:41.397]  And then the audio is her talking about how much fun it was and making jokes saying she knew her clients were guilty.
[01:24:42.762 --> 01:24:45.825]  Then she got caught trying to frame Richard Nixon on the Watergate Committee.
[01:24:45.825 --> 01:24:47.406]  She's famous for that.
[01:24:47.406 --> 01:24:56.173]  And then all the deaths in Arkansas, all the corruption, all the sellouts, going to ruining Libya, destabilizing it, blowing it up and saying, I came, I saw, he died.
[01:24:56.173 --> 01:25:06.021]  And then standing down at Benghazi and letting everybody get killed, helping start the whole Arab Spring and turning ISIS and al-Qaeda loose and everything else she's done.
[01:25:06.021 --> 01:25:11.166]  She doesn't know why anybody doesn't like her and rigging the debates and
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:28.086]  Now it turns out you're demanding all the Republican ads be banned on the internet and Twitter does it and filing all these lawsuits against me and calling me the dark heart and saying I should be taken off the air and attacking the First Amendment and saying ban the guns and saying black people are animals like dogs have to be brought to heel.
[01:25:28.086 --> 01:25:33.288]  These are quotes.
[01:25:33.288 --> 01:25:35.189]  She just honestly has no idea.
[01:25:36.937 --> 01:25:43.558]  Because it's so funny that her and her husband flew around with Epstein and he used these little kids to get people set up for them and that's what they've been known for.
[01:25:43.558 --> 01:25:50.940]  And Clinton's settled three rape case lawsuits.
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:54.781]  Her husband.
[01:25:54.781 --> 01:25:59.482]  And now she's got Pelosi trying to impeach the president so Pelosi can become president and appoint her vice president.
[01:25:59.482 --> 01:26:02.043]  And I told you that two years ago, a year ago.
[01:26:02.043 --> 01:26:02.703]  We have all the clips.
[01:26:02.703 --> 01:26:03.423]  Want me to play them for you?
[01:26:04.619 --> 01:26:05.239]  I love Savage.
[01:26:05.239 --> 01:26:06.800]  He said, I said that four weeks ago.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.562]  Oh, well, Roger Stone said it before Trump got in office.
[01:26:11.562 --> 01:26:15.063]  He said, if he wins, they'll try to impeach him and Pelosi will make her vice president.
[01:26:15.063 --> 01:26:17.324]  If they don't have an election, she'll win.
[01:26:17.324 --> 01:26:21.106]  Because they never give up.
[01:26:21.106 --> 01:26:23.747]  Because they've never been brought to justice.
[01:26:23.747 --> 01:26:31.330]  Saw this meme, wherever you're afraid to swim, out in the ocean, just remember, you're statistically more likely to be killed by Hillary Clinton than by a shark.
[01:26:33.752 --> 01:26:46.599]  And then the woman presided over the sanctions under Obama and under Clinton before that, a shadow president before and the State Department head after that.
[01:26:46.599 --> 01:26:49.040]  Two million extra Iraqis died under their sanctions.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:53.343]  They were three times worse than W, W's daddies, HW.
[01:26:54.986 --> 01:26:56.646]  No food, no medicine.
[01:26:56.646 --> 01:27:00.828]  Iraq had had a huge population bloom since the 60s with oil.
[01:27:00.828 --> 01:27:02.828]  They could only produce about a third of the food they needed.
[01:27:02.828 --> 01:27:05.229]  A couple million people died.
[01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:06.909]  Starvation, a lot of it.
[01:27:06.909 --> 01:27:08.130]  Most of them kids.
[01:27:08.130 --> 01:27:09.930]  Half a million back in the middle of it.
[01:27:09.930 --> 01:27:12.611]  And Madeleine Albright said it's a good price to pay.
[01:27:12.611 --> 01:27:14.511]  Like, you know, how good's that fried chicken?
[01:27:14.511 --> 01:27:16.492]  Well, it's finger-lickin' good.
[01:27:16.492 --> 01:27:18.052]  That's how good it is.
[01:27:18.052 --> 01:27:20.513]  And I could talk about her crimes for a thousand years.
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:24.041]  We're going to give the number out.
[01:27:24.041 --> 01:27:25.862]  We're going to go to break.
[01:27:25.862 --> 01:27:26.903]  We're going to take your calls.
[01:27:26.903 --> 01:27:30.325]  877-789-2539 on what's happening.
[01:27:30.325 --> 01:27:35.329]  Let's go out to break with Louie Gohmer saying civil wars don't start with shooting.
[01:27:35.329 --> 01:27:39.312]  It comes at the end and we're entering that wheelhouse now.
[01:27:39.312 --> 01:27:40.093]  This is real.
[01:27:40.093 --> 01:27:42.094]  Criminals are coming for you.
[01:27:42.094 --> 01:27:46.538]  They want to conquer America and what people fought and bled to create.
[01:27:46.538 --> 01:27:51.762]  It was paid for in blood and they think it's going to have to be bought out of
[01:27:53.715 --> 01:27:57.198]  Bankruptcy and foreclosure by blood.
[01:27:57.198 --> 01:28:03.042]  We better work hard in the information war before you gotta start paying in blood.
[01:28:03.042 --> 01:28:04.163]  I'm ready.
[01:28:04.163 --> 01:28:06.885]  I'll pay with every damn drop I've got.
[01:28:06.885 --> 01:28:08.867]  But I'm gonna fight hard before I gotta do it.
[01:28:10.404 --> 01:28:11.644]  Pay up, folks.
[01:28:11.644 --> 01:28:12.925]  Here's Gohmert.
[01:28:12.925 --> 01:28:20.686]  We don't want the committee with the most expertise on constitutional issues dealing with these constitutional issues.
[01:28:20.686 --> 01:28:34.090]  We want to put armed guards outside a hearing and have it in a secret compartmented information facility.
[01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:35.010]  And we're not going to let
[01:28:36.112 --> 01:28:41.693]  The other side called their own witnesses so we get a fair picture of what actually went on.
[01:28:41.693 --> 01:28:45.674]  And we're not even going to let them ask questions we don't want them to ask.
[01:28:45.674 --> 01:28:48.975]  We'll instruct the witnesses not to answer.
[01:28:48.975 --> 01:28:59.158]  Because you see, they want it to be a one-sided, non-due process sham court.
[01:28:59.158 --> 01:29:04.699]  And it's about to push this country to a civil war if they were to get their wishes.
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:09.402]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[01:29:09.402 --> 01:29:12.303]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:09.169]  Hey Alex!
[01:30:09.169 --> 01:30:10.510]  Oh my God!
[01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:13.311]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[01:30:13.311 --> 01:30:15.913]  Look, in January 2016 I went in a hospital.
[01:30:15.913 --> 01:30:19.755]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June.
[01:30:19.755 --> 01:30:23.436]  And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[01:30:23.436 --> 01:30:24.457]  Let me tell you something, man.
[01:30:24.777 --> 01:30:44.374]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every test nobody could figure out what it is and then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials I said you know what I'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have it but I ordered to have
[01:30:44.694 --> 01:30:45.274]  It's true, folks.
[01:30:45.274 --> 01:30:47.655]  We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality.
[01:30:47.655 --> 01:30:49.495]  And living defense is over-the-top good.
[01:31:07.967 --> 01:31:08.988]  Here's the bad news.

[01:31:22.934 --> 01:31:26.196]  Here is the good news, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:31:49.214 --> 01:31:50.155]  So please take action.

[01:32:50.293 --> 01:32:50.994]  Double Patriot points.
[01:32:50.994 --> 01:32:51.515]  That's about
[01:32:51.775 --> 01:32:53.716]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:39.875]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:39.875 --> 01:33:46.240]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:48.962]  Well, we knew it was coming.
[01:33:48.962 --> 01:33:50.003]  But we sucker punched them.
[01:33:50.003 --> 01:33:50.824]  They were so arrogant.
[01:33:50.824 --> 01:33:51.665]  We got Trump in.
[01:33:51.665 --> 01:33:54.007]  We've got populists getting in all over the world.
[01:33:54.007 --> 01:33:57.550]  There's obviously patriots inside the government, intelligence agencies and corporations.
[01:33:59.622 --> 01:34:03.265]  Who are helping as much as they can, but they're not directing any of it.
[01:34:03.265 --> 01:34:07.968]  This is all literally an organic human push.
[01:34:07.968 --> 01:34:10.269]  And the globalists are scared because they can feel it.
[01:34:10.269 --> 01:34:13.231]  It's only beginning to power up.
[01:34:13.231 --> 01:34:14.012]  We've got to push it.
[01:34:15.569 --> 01:34:20.591]  The enemy can just feel it, because every action also has its psychic action in the universe.
[01:34:20.591 --> 01:34:30.054]  The enemy can hear the air raid sirens, they can see the push back by people that don't want to serve Satan, and don't want this anti-human, post-human world.
[01:34:30.054 --> 01:34:34.375]  And they knew this resistance was coming, but they thought they had it in the bag.
[01:34:34.375 --> 01:34:41.438]  And now, as humanity and our spirit powers up, the enemy is launching its counter-offensive.
[01:34:44.138 --> 01:34:52.202]  But we've got to hold fire here on the physical confrontation as bad as it is.
[01:34:52.202 --> 01:35:00.506]  The enemy is trying to trick us into violent outbursts by their physical attacks.
[01:35:00.506 --> 01:35:06.129]  We have to have information warfare attacks and peaceful physical action.
[01:35:06.129 --> 01:35:13.473]  And we are entering the time of civil disobedience.
[01:35:14.736 --> 01:35:18.018]  Not violent action, but civil disobedience.
[01:35:18.018 --> 01:35:37.488]  And I mean, 50,000 people should be outside of those committee hearing rooms just chanting that it's a fraud and it's not due process, that the president needs to be able to face his accusers.
[01:35:37.488 --> 01:35:38.009]  And we need
[01:35:39.355 --> 01:35:56.801]  Individuals leaking from inside mainstream media and corporate media and establishment enemy media and we just need wherever you're at in any way or talking to your neighbor or going and talking to your pastor or getting up in front of the church and if your church doesn't want you getting up talking about the evil in the world and confronting it then it's not a church.
[01:35:56.801 --> 01:36:00.282]  It is a government globalist controlled demon.
[01:36:00.282 --> 01:36:06.224]  It's that simple.
[01:36:06.224 --> 01:36:08.485]  And it's gonna get very clear ladies and gentlemen
[01:36:10.251 --> 01:36:22.978]  For everyone, that they should have fought this earlier.
[01:36:22.978 --> 01:36:27.921]  Because appeasement of something, this evil, does not go well.
[01:36:27.921 --> 01:36:28.762]  That's how evil works.
[01:36:28.762 --> 01:36:33.965]  There can be long periods where you appease evil by increment, and it's satisfied.
[01:36:33.965 --> 01:36:37.747]  But it's not really satisfied, it's patient.
[01:36:40.233 --> 01:36:43.735]  And it's got a long-term game to bend you.
[01:36:43.735 --> 01:36:54.700]  Like George Soros said in the New York Times last Friday, he said, we're gonna bend the will of the American people.
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:57.821]  He said, the American people are bending.
[01:36:57.821 --> 01:37:00.843]  And he said, and I intend to bend them to my will.
[01:37:00.843 --> 01:37:03.424]  You like that?
[01:37:03.424 --> 01:37:04.544]  You like him bending your will?
[01:37:04.544 --> 01:37:05.385]  He's not bending my will.
[01:37:16.394 --> 01:37:17.195]  Gonna bend your will?
[01:37:17.195 --> 01:37:21.979]  You gonna go with him?
[01:37:21.979 --> 01:37:33.649]  Because all he is, is a general of Satan.
[01:37:33.649 --> 01:37:41.256]  That means he's a wraith, he's a loser, he's a slug.
[01:37:41.256 --> 01:37:44.018]  He's a lure on the end of a fishing line.
[01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:54.083]  He's not even an errand boy.
[01:37:54.083 --> 01:38:05.132]  He's the dim little light on the end of an anglerfish's lure.
[01:38:05.132 --> 01:38:09.116]  There is no choice but to fight them.
[01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:13.800]  And again, people say, what do you do?
[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:28.825]  Well, if you print up business cards and put InfoWars.com forbidden information, and hand out a few hundred of those a week, and all of you did that, it would change the world.
[01:38:28.825 --> 01:38:30.166]  Or had your own website,
[01:38:31.513 --> 01:38:35.736]  That sends people to forbidden information and said, hey, this is what they don't want you to know.
[01:38:35.736 --> 01:38:36.676]  This is the truth.
[01:38:36.676 --> 01:38:41.839]  And you know, so many other places and things say that, but this really is the zeitgeist.
[01:38:41.839 --> 01:38:42.820]  We all know it.
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:43.820]  It's not Alex Jones.
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:44.541]  It's not you.
[01:38:44.541 --> 01:38:46.382]  It's not Michael Savage that was on.
[01:38:46.382 --> 01:38:47.763]  It's not all the other guests.
[01:38:47.763 --> 01:38:48.183]  It's not.
[01:38:48.183 --> 01:38:50.624]  It's all of us.
[01:38:50.624 --> 01:38:54.026]  This is the fount.
[01:38:54.026 --> 01:38:57.989]  We're right in the center of the resistance.
[01:38:57.989 --> 01:38:59.990]  Planted right dead smack.
[01:39:03.467 --> 01:39:07.409]  Of the globalists trying to take over Texas and then the entire Midwest.
[01:39:07.409 --> 01:39:13.451]  And they'll link up with Chicago and Austin as the crime syndicate takeover of what's left of the country.
[01:39:13.451 --> 01:39:19.394]  I mean, the UN came in here 20 years ago with all the globalist investment and said they would take over Austin first.
[01:39:19.394 --> 01:39:23.616]  They have triangle models, then Dallas, then Houston, then San Antonio, then all the outlying towns.
[01:39:25.233 --> 01:39:35.202]  How they then bring in, quote, migrants from all over the world and build ten-story buildings in little towns and then bring them in and then run people for office and take over your towns.
[01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:37.524]  I mean, this is an invasion.
[01:39:37.524 --> 01:39:40.687]  Right before Obama left, he put tens of billions into funding.
[01:39:40.687 --> 01:39:45.091]  He's saying that, oh, rural areas are racist because they're white in many areas.
[01:39:45.091 --> 01:39:49.135]  We're going to import people into the rural areas.
[01:39:49.135 --> 01:39:50.937]  But what he really means is they're political takeover.
[01:39:51.869 --> 01:40:15.524]  And they're going to bring the poor minority slaves they've already got on their plantation out of their big re-education camps into the cities, led by little leftist priesthood leaders who are the white social workers who will then come and lead the minorities into your area and teach them you're evil and teach them you're bad and teach them that they're the boss as long as they're anti-white.
[01:40:15.524 --> 01:40:16.825]  I mean, that's the plan.
[01:40:16.825 --> 01:40:18.566]  And you heard Michael Savage talk about it earlier.
[01:40:21.766 --> 01:40:29.293]  And that's why when you're around a leftist that's got a job in government, they'll laugh at you when you tell them this, because they know all of it!
[01:40:29.293 --> 01:40:31.615]  They go to mail meetings.
[01:40:31.615 --> 01:40:33.036]  Millions of them.
[01:40:33.036 --> 01:40:40.883]  They dream of how they're going to torture patriot men in prisons and stomp your guts out and rape your children.
[01:40:42.042 --> 01:40:43.903]  They have converted them.
[01:40:43.903 --> 01:40:45.524]  First, they don't believe in God.
[01:40:45.524 --> 01:40:46.485]  Then they brainwash them.
[01:40:46.485 --> 01:40:49.767]  Then they get them hateful against Christians and conservatives.
[01:40:49.767 --> 01:40:52.248]  And they go, by the way, we're into witchcraft and stuff.
[01:40:52.248 --> 01:40:53.769]  And suddenly they feel this feeling.
[01:40:53.769 --> 01:40:58.892]  They were so empty because instead of not having God and just having nothing, now they've got the devil.
[01:40:58.892 --> 01:40:59.672]  And they go, ah!
[01:40:59.672 --> 01:41:02.174]  And they just, they convert like that.
[01:41:02.174 --> 01:41:03.134]  It's a factory.
[01:41:03.134 --> 01:41:08.538]  They take lost wimps and they load them into the meat grinder and they come out Satanist on the other side.
[01:41:09.341 --> 01:41:12.607]  And they have been promised power over you!
[01:41:12.607 --> 01:41:15.472]  And they've been promised man flesh!
[01:41:15.472 --> 01:41:20.722]  It's that simple.
[01:41:25.888 --> 01:41:33.652]  And no matter how crazy that sounds, go to any Lepus event, and it's suddenly women going, you look like an old housewife, and she'll just go, oh, Satan.
[01:41:33.652 --> 01:41:36.513]  And you're like, we have hidden cameras and people posing as them.
[01:41:36.513 --> 01:41:37.774]  We're like, what do we do with babies?
[01:41:37.774 --> 01:41:38.214]  Kill them?
[01:41:38.214 --> 01:41:40.295]  The little voices make me sick.
[01:41:40.295 --> 01:41:44.017]  And you're like, what the hell?
[01:41:44.017 --> 01:41:46.198]  I mean, what the hell's going on here, man?
[01:41:46.198 --> 01:41:48.099]  We aren't in Kansas anymore.
[01:41:51.957 --> 01:41:52.878]  Two years ago.
[01:41:52.878 --> 01:41:55.480]  Don't let him read InfoWars or Breitbart.
[01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.683]  Don't let him see what... Some nice clips in my ear.
[01:41:59.683 --> 01:42:03.106]  Gotta enjoy those.
[01:42:03.106 --> 01:42:04.988]  Yeah, I don't even hear what that mic's... What'd you say over your mic?
[01:42:04.988 --> 01:42:07.570]  Oh, it's no big deal.
[01:42:07.570 --> 01:42:08.951]  I like it.
[01:42:08.951 --> 01:42:09.932]  Listen, we got a live show.
[01:42:09.932 --> 01:42:10.752]  We're gonna have mistakes.
[01:42:10.752 --> 01:42:11.913]  Stuff's gonna go through my ear feed.
[01:42:11.913 --> 01:42:13.475]  Stuff, I'm fine with it.
[01:42:13.475 --> 01:42:16.077]  Um, you know, I'm gonna go to your calls when we come back.
[01:42:17.972 --> 01:42:30.239]  I still didn't get to the full Louie Gummer clip, I said I would, and I got all these other clips of the insanity going on, and the lawless, complete takeover that is taking place and happening, and you're like... It's incredible!
[01:42:30.239 --> 01:42:37.824]  Convicted pedophiles nationwide, dressed like It the Clown, unannounced in many cases, are getting their hands on elementary students.
[01:42:37.824 --> 01:42:38.784]  Yeah!
[01:42:38.784 --> 01:42:43.267]  Just like they did to the Catholic Church, and just like they did to the Boy Scouts now.
[01:42:46.311 --> 01:42:51.113]  Remember three years ago they go, they're giving five-year-olds condoms and saying have sex, it was in the news.
[01:42:51.113 --> 01:42:52.714]  People couldn't believe it, couldn't face it.
[01:42:52.714 --> 01:42:57.696]  And now it's just the Boy Scouts and a lot of parents don't get their kids out, they just go, well that's what we do.
[01:42:57.696 --> 01:43:01.517]  We take our children to be raped by their Scoutmasters, hell Satan.
[01:43:01.517 --> 01:43:06.300]  They're taking over everything.
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:09.281]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[01:43:10.458 --> 01:43:13.963]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[01:43:13.963 --> 01:43:24.276]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[01:43:24.276 --> 01:43:25.418]  We've had Oxford come out
[01:43:25.518 --> 01:43:26.279]  We're good to go.
[01:43:43.918 --> 01:43:48.181]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[01:43:48.181 --> 01:43:52.084]  We have a It's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap.
[01:43:52.084 --> 01:43:52.944]  It's black and white.
[01:43:52.944 --> 01:43:53.444]  Very nice.
[01:43:53.444 --> 01:43:54.925]  It has the OK symbol on it.
[01:43:54.925 --> 01:43:56.747]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[01:43:56.747 --> 01:43:58.748]  Infowars.com is on the back.
[01:43:58.748 --> 01:44:04.712]  Get yours today at infowarsstore.com and support free speech by supporting InfoWars while having a great hat.
[01:44:07.305 --> 01:44:10.987]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[01:44:10.987 --> 01:44:18.972]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[01:44:18.972 --> 01:44:21.553]  It's just that simple.
[01:44:21.553 --> 01:44:27.957]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[01:44:27.957 --> 01:44:28.477]  Others like
[01:44:29.037 --> 01:44:31.138]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[01:44:31.138 --> 01:44:31.858]  Get both.
[01:44:31.858 --> 01:44:33.319]  They're both great for you.
[01:44:33.319 --> 01:44:37.741]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[01:44:37.741 --> 01:44:39.962]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[01:44:39.962 --> 01:44:41.302]  That's why I harp on it.
[01:44:41.302 --> 01:44:45.484]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[01:44:45.484 --> 01:44:47.645]  Lower IQ makes you sluggish.
[01:44:47.645 --> 01:44:48.726]  You don't live as long.
[01:44:48.726 --> 01:44:49.486]  It's simple.
[01:44:49.486 --> 01:44:53.708]  Get your high-quality iodine at InfoWarsTore.com and help fund the InfoWar.
[01:44:54.929 --> 01:44:58.872]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[01:44:58.872 --> 01:45:00.693]  It's the Iodine Challenge.
[01:45:00.693 --> 01:45:06.737]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[01:45:06.737 --> 01:45:11.221]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds, and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[01:45:11.221 --> 01:45:13.122]  I don't care what your views are.
[01:45:13.122 --> 01:45:16.144]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[01:45:16.144 --> 01:45:16.925]  That's important.
[01:45:16.925 --> 01:45:18.526]  But we have something in common.
[01:45:18.526 --> 01:45:22.129]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:29.816]  Clinton deep state bag man Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to Congress and the world.
[01:45:29.816 --> 01:45:35.562]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted.
[01:45:35.562 --> 01:45:40.006]  Word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[01:45:40.006 --> 01:45:41.708]  From my new home in New Zealand I will...
[01:45:44.683 --> 01:45:48.245]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[01:45:48.245 --> 01:45:50.165]  Not so fast, criminal.
[01:45:50.165 --> 01:45:51.826]  We're going to bring you to justice.
[01:45:51.826 --> 01:45:54.067]  And we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[01:45:54.067 --> 01:45:58.869]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[01:45:58.869 --> 01:46:01.290]  But the American people know how much you hate us.
[01:46:01.290 --> 01:46:06.032]  And we're fighting back at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Ban.Video!
[01:46:07.353 --> 01:46:09.534]  All of our bodies are different.
[01:46:09.534 --> 01:46:12.335]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[01:46:12.335 --> 01:46:15.336]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[01:46:15.336 --> 01:46:20.998]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something you don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[01:46:22.097 --> 01:46:31.188]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life completely changes.
[01:46:31.188 --> 01:46:31.929]  I'm healthier.
[01:46:31.929 --> 01:46:33.290]  I have more energy.
[01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:34.111]  I lose weight.
[01:46:34.111 --> 01:46:34.892]  I look better.
[01:46:34.892 --> 01:46:36.454]  Everybody notices.
[01:46:36.454 --> 01:46:39.137]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit
[01:46:39.998 --> 01:46:43.739]  To take X2 Body's Ultimate Turmeric.
[01:46:43.739 --> 01:46:48.800]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the Gut Fusion from InfoWars Life.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:53.701]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[01:46:53.701 --> 01:46:59.102]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use and I don't talk enough about is Gut Fusion.
[01:46:59.102 --> 01:47:00.203]  Folks, check it out.
[01:47:00.203 --> 01:47:02.143]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:47:02.143 --> 01:47:03.123]  50% off right now.
[01:47:03.123 --> 01:47:04.664]  The sale's about to end.
[01:47:04.664 --> 01:47:05.284]  GutFusion.
[01:47:05.284 --> 01:47:06.244]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:47:10.010 --> 01:47:12.624]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:33.394 --> 01:47:38.378]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:38.378 --> 01:47:46.245]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:46.245 --> 01:47:53.270]  And it's about to push this country to a civil war if they were to get their wishes.
[01:47:53.270 --> 01:48:00.997]  And if there's one thing I don't want to see in my lifetime, I don't want to ever have participation in, it's a civil war.
[01:48:02.620 --> 01:48:12.923]  Some historian, I don't remember who, said guns are only involved in the last phase of a civil war.
[01:48:12.923 --> 01:48:24.607]  What's going on here has not protected the Constitution, it's not protected the institutions, it's not protected this little experiment in self-government.
[01:48:24.607 --> 01:48:27.968]  No, what it has done is put it all at risk.
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:35.541]  All right, we're going to your phone calls throughout the next hour and some into the next.
[01:48:35.541 --> 01:48:40.562]  Before that, I'll take 15 minutes of Beckett's time and he'll do an excellent job as always on Fridays.
[01:48:40.562 --> 01:48:43.043]  We're taking a lot of calls now.
[01:48:43.043 --> 01:48:50.265]  Texas to protest Deep State Kingpin Hillary Clinton in Austin this Sunday, November 3rd at 1 p.m.
[01:48:50.265 --> 01:48:55.266]  The doors open at 2, but the Slimers, it's sold out, will be lining up to see their demon god.
[01:48:57.782 --> 01:49:06.804]  So there will be again a satanic procession and a review by their General Medusa, the Gorgon.
[01:49:06.804 --> 01:49:09.905]  And I will be there about, so I'll just let you know that.
[01:49:09.905 --> 01:49:13.765]  I'll be on the ground and I'll be riding around and I'll be doing a lot of things.
[01:49:13.765 --> 01:49:17.446]  Other folks will be doing a lot of things, the information war.
[01:49:17.446 --> 01:49:25.268]  The Deep State Kingpin herself will be there with Webster Hubble's daughter, Chelsea, Mr. Ed Clinton.
[01:49:26.894 --> 01:49:29.074]  Coming up, I'll hit more of this after we take calls.
[01:49:29.074 --> 01:49:36.856]  Antifa supporter brags about giving kids, dressed as Trump, fentanyl-laced candy that could kill them.
[01:49:36.856 --> 01:49:39.137]  These people are very, very sick.
[01:49:39.137 --> 01:49:44.818]  Pelosi begins political death march as impeachment resolution offers few answers.
[01:49:44.818 --> 01:49:48.719]  They've got a big raft of stuff they're going to spring on the president.
[01:49:48.719 --> 01:49:50.099]  We're breaking it all down.
[01:49:50.099 --> 01:49:53.980]  Facebook bans InfoWars, allows Drag Queen graphic abortion video.
[01:49:55.578 --> 01:50:04.491]  I guess RT did a big report on that, so I guess there's a video report on that too, so maybe we'll get to that.
[01:50:04.491 --> 01:50:07.675]  But I do want to go to your calls.
[01:50:07.675 --> 01:50:10.560]  Also, I'm seeing everybody go, wow!
[01:50:12.605 --> 01:50:18.273]  You know, Jones and Roger Stone, back when Trump was Trump president-elect, said Hillary never gives up.
[01:50:18.273 --> 01:50:21.637]  Well, we know that about her modus operandi, her psychology.
[01:50:21.637 --> 01:50:23.280]  This is criminology.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:26.244]  And normal people tend to act the same as they did before.
[01:50:28.183 --> 01:50:33.505]  You know, just never really get tired of just being normal and being nice and having fun and being a good person.
[01:50:33.505 --> 01:50:35.706]  You know, enchiladas and cold beer never gets old.
[01:50:35.706 --> 01:50:39.047]  Going out on the motorboat, go fishing, go hiking.
[01:50:39.047 --> 01:50:42.569]  You know, having fun with your kids, your family never gets old.
[01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:46.790]  Globalists want to commit crimes and dominate people and molest children.
[01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:52.353]  And they want power over people.
[01:50:52.353 --> 01:50:53.293]  And when you pull back,
[01:50:55.538 --> 01:50:57.159]  And you look at Hillary, we know what she's gonna do.
[01:50:57.159 --> 01:50:59.601]  She can't help but run.
[01:50:59.601 --> 01:51:01.863]  She's still in control of the DNC.
[01:51:01.863 --> 01:51:03.344]  She's running the phone calls.
[01:51:03.344 --> 01:51:05.705]  She's collecting money.
[01:51:05.705 --> 01:51:09.889]  She's on every damn TV show in the country, and all the other candidates aren't!
[01:51:09.889 --> 01:51:12.250]  She's getting more coverage than all the other ones combined!
[01:51:12.250 --> 01:51:14.332]  What the hell does that look like to you?
[01:51:14.332 --> 01:51:23.719]  So people are like, oh, wow, yeah, and you guys said how they'll have an impeachment, and then they'll kick him out.
[01:51:25.029 --> 01:51:29.110]  That'll cause all hell to break loose.
[01:51:29.110 --> 01:51:30.711]  That's a whole other ball of wax how that would go.
[01:51:30.711 --> 01:51:33.911]  Whole other kettle of fish.
[01:51:33.911 --> 01:51:35.592]  That's a new country right there.
[01:51:35.592 --> 01:51:40.913]  That's uncharted territory.
[01:51:40.913 --> 01:51:42.894]  Except history repeats itself, we know exactly what'll happen.
[01:51:44.710 --> 01:51:51.273]  We know several different scenarios that will unfold with combinations of one another, and it's not fun.
[01:51:51.273 --> 01:52:02.258]  But these little crazies think, well, no one ever punished us, so we'll keep pushing war and civil war and race war and death and pedophilia and satanism and collapsing everything and our cities will be open, sirs.
[01:52:03.339 --> 01:52:16.107]  That's okay, because no one ever punishes them, except our lack of action against them will allow them to do so bad, they collapse everything and cause a giant civil war, and they'll be stacked up like dead cordwood.
[01:52:16.107 --> 01:52:18.749]  But it won't matter, because they're scum!
[01:52:18.749 --> 01:52:19.990]  We don't want that to happen!
[01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:26.674]  A real civil war kicks off, I give it 50 million dead.
[01:52:27.813 --> 01:52:29.754]  Nuclear reactors melting down, you name it.
[01:52:29.754 --> 01:52:30.474]  I mean, the U.S.
[01:52:30.474 --> 01:52:33.576]  is going to be a slaughterhouse.
[01:52:33.576 --> 01:52:36.297]  All these demons claim they want a bunch of blood and death.
[01:52:36.297 --> 01:52:41.620]  Well, you know, when the good guys start dealing, it's always about 100 times worse than you guys can imagine.
[01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:49.824]  Because while you're toiling and smiling over some bloody baby you're raping, hundreds of you will be wiped out for every baby you've killed.
[01:52:49.824 --> 01:52:55.687]  So, I don't want this to happen.
[01:52:57.059 --> 01:52:59.240]  But, this isn't rhetoric.
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:03.402]  This isn't like, oh, there's a breeze of civil war and physical war here.
[01:53:03.402 --> 01:53:05.944]  It's a hurricane already.
[01:53:05.944 --> 01:53:18.970]  The globalists are like mentally retarded monkeys on PCP with flamethrowers in their hands, lit, running through a fireworks factory.
[01:53:18.970 --> 01:53:20.511]  With sparklers sticking out of their rear-ends.
[01:53:25.148 --> 01:53:26.509]  We're already a mess.
[01:53:26.509 --> 01:53:28.451]  We already killed 60 million babies.
[01:53:28.451 --> 01:53:31.073]  We already kill babies after they're born.
[01:53:31.073 --> 01:53:35.717]  We are a demonic mess.
[01:53:35.717 --> 01:53:41.442]  We're hitting the bottom of the decadent cycle, and most countries don't get out of it without a giant bloodbath.
[01:53:41.442 --> 01:53:46.466]  Fountains of blood, a thousand feet high, spouting.
[01:53:46.466 --> 01:53:53.312]  And so all these good old boys have been buying your guns over the years, and whenever it kicks off, I'm gonna get a bunch of liberals.
[01:53:54.639 --> 01:54:00.600]  That's like saying if you let a dog crap in your yard for a year, you're gonna run out there one day and stomp on all the dog turds.
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:04.661]  All you had to do was go get the neighbor to keep their damn dog in their backyard, or come clean it up.
[01:54:04.661 --> 01:54:19.724]  But instead, you're always piling guns up going, one day I'll stop that dog crap!
[01:54:19.724 --> 01:54:20.204]  Truth is,
[01:54:21.368 --> 01:54:23.731]  If God blew up the whole planet, we deserve it.
[01:54:23.731 --> 01:54:28.235]  But there's a lot of innocent people on the planet, and God's got a plan for us, so God has held back.
[01:54:28.235 --> 01:54:34.442]  But let me tell you, we deserve whatever's coming to us.
[01:54:34.442 --> 01:54:41.149]  So just get right with God and stop worrying about dying, and then you're not going to care about what leftists say about you.
[01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:42.811]  You're not going to care about what's in the newspaper.
[01:54:44.542 --> 01:54:52.586]  Every time they lie about me and do horrible things, it just confirms how evil they are and that I'm on the right path and that means I must be hurting them.
[01:54:52.586 --> 01:54:57.348]  So, again, I take their attacks as guidance systems.
[01:54:57.348 --> 01:55:00.990]  Just like a missile hones in on a radar dish.
[01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:03.811]  Or on the exhaust port of an aircraft.
[01:55:03.811 --> 01:55:06.493]  And I go where the bullets are coming from.
[01:55:06.493 --> 01:55:07.393]  I use them.
[01:55:07.393 --> 01:55:08.954]  It's my only eyesight.
[01:55:08.954 --> 01:55:12.676]  And so, it's the only thing true the enemy does is their lies.
[01:55:13.604 --> 01:55:14.345]  is their attacks.
[01:55:14.345 --> 01:55:18.427]  That's how you guide into what they don't like, what they want you to get away from.
[01:55:18.427 --> 01:55:25.772]  And the pedophilia and the devil worship is what they don't want to go close, and what they really don't want discussed, because it's who they are.
[01:55:25.772 --> 01:55:27.733]  Hillary can't even hide herself.
[01:55:27.733 --> 01:55:31.335]  Look at her in these videos on TV.
[01:55:31.335 --> 01:55:33.777]  I mean, she's a frightening looking woman.
[01:55:33.777 --> 01:55:38.880]  Look at her when she was a young mob boss's daughter in Chicago.
[01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:40.421]  A little snake, but still evil.
[01:55:40.421 --> 01:55:42.963]  But now, she's drunk on a lot of blood.
[01:55:45.029 --> 01:55:49.934]  And that is a full-blown devil worshipper right there.
[01:55:49.934 --> 01:55:51.957]  I know the folks that have worshipped Satan with her.
[01:55:51.957 --> 01:55:53.759]  We've had them on.
[01:55:53.759 --> 01:55:56.221]  People went and dug out news articles and actually found it.
[01:55:56.221 --> 01:55:58.484]  Hillary Clinton worships Satan.
[01:55:58.484 --> 01:55:59.926]  She drinks blood.
[01:55:59.926 --> 01:56:02.468]  She rapes children.
[01:56:02.468 --> 01:56:02.849]  Period.
[01:56:04.394 --> 01:56:05.935]  A lot of folks are like, yeah, we know she does.
[01:56:05.935 --> 01:56:06.536]  It's all coming out.
[01:56:06.536 --> 01:56:07.516]  Aren't you scared?
[01:56:07.516 --> 01:56:16.563]  I'm scared of not fighting her because God will send me to a freaking dimension to be locked up with her.
[01:56:16.563 --> 01:56:21.087]  If I do not oppose her, I am scared to death she doesn't come after me.
[01:56:21.087 --> 01:56:31.975]  I absolutely could care less, except I want to expend my energy in their annihilation.
[01:56:36.721 --> 01:56:46.147]  The head of her foundation got caught smuggling hundreds of children out of Haiti that were disappearing.
[01:56:46.147 --> 01:56:52.351]  Being turned into walnut sauce.
[01:56:52.351 --> 01:56:54.973]  You're like, this is insane, yeah.
[01:56:54.973 --> 01:57:00.857]  They sit around farmhouses and have full meals with little kids' body parts.
[01:57:03.527 --> 01:57:16.890]  They're completely psychotic, ladies and gentlemen, and they think because they're so evil that you can't deal with it because they're so powerful because they do this.
[01:57:16.890 --> 01:57:20.151]  It's the raw exercise of power.
[01:57:20.151 --> 01:57:23.572]  And they believe they're invincible and they're not.
[01:57:23.572 --> 01:57:25.153]  So, I got a bunch of the clips together.
[01:57:25.153 --> 01:57:30.694]  The one we found was Roger and I back in January of this year laying out exactly how they do it.
[01:57:34.753 --> 01:57:38.794]  You know, Hillary right out of college, her father said, you must bathe in Satanism.
[01:57:38.794 --> 01:57:43.556]  We're gonna send you down to Arkansas with these good old boys who like to torture and rape kids who definitely get caught sometimes.
[01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:46.336]  She went down there and wallowed around with those old boys.
[01:57:46.336 --> 01:57:50.398]  Had a lot of sex with men, had a lot of sex with women, had a lot of sex with kids.
[01:57:50.398 --> 01:57:54.879]  I mean, Hillary Clinton's a full-on, absolute psychotic devil worshiper.
[01:57:58.519 --> 01:58:03.763]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me, and she had her digital textbook.
[01:58:03.763 --> 01:58:14.672]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table, and I clicked on iodine, and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough iodine.
[01:58:14.672 --> 01:58:18.815]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy, and it's not true.
[01:58:18.815 --> 01:58:21.537]  But, Dad, it's right here on the periodic table.
[01:58:21.537 --> 01:58:22.178]  When I click it,
[01:58:22.398 --> 01:58:23.619]  Saying exactly what you said.
[01:58:23.619 --> 01:58:25.220]  And I said, I know, honey.
[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:29.722]  That's why I have you take a high-quality, nutraceutical-grade iodine.
[01:58:29.722 --> 01:58:32.244]  It's because it's why you're so vibrant.
[01:58:32.244 --> 01:58:33.564]  It's why you're so alive.
[01:58:33.564 --> 01:58:39.628]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age.
[01:58:39.628 --> 01:58:48.653]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself to know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion, are mentally retarded.
[01:58:49.093 --> 01:58:51.834]  On the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[01:58:51.834 --> 01:58:54.034]  Research it and find out for yourself now.

[02:00:00.071 --> 02:00:02.713]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:16.932 --> 02:00:25.656]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.656 --> 02:00:29.817]  By the way, these Satanists do more and more heinous rituals.
[02:00:29.817 --> 02:00:31.638]  It gives them more power.
[02:00:31.638 --> 02:00:35.660]  In their hierarchy, they admire whoever's killed more people directly.
[02:00:35.660 --> 02:00:41.122]  Indirectly is a side bonus, but not seen as getting your hands dirty yourself.
[02:00:43.052 --> 02:00:44.933]  And the more innocent, the better.
[02:00:44.933 --> 02:00:53.379]  And see, you know, why would the deputy Chicago mob boss, that was her dad for Daley, he was the deputy to the most powerful mob boss probably in America.
[02:00:53.379 --> 02:00:56.041]  Well, he's the mob's Italian.
[02:00:56.041 --> 02:01:00.064]  I mean, you break that's just one branch of organized crime.
[02:01:00.064 --> 02:01:08.030]  And she was sent down to Arkansas to Little Rock and the hot springs because the main capital of the Chicago mafia was really Arkansas.
[02:01:08.854 --> 02:01:24.421]  Going back to about 1900, and if you go there, they'll tell you that there's museums, and it's where they really lived, and where they produced during the Prohibition, the white lightning, at an industrial scale, and shipped it out in so-called bottle water containers.
[02:01:26.451 --> 02:01:27.251]  And so that's what I'm saying.
[02:01:27.251 --> 02:01:32.854]  I mean, she was sent down there right out of college, trained by the mafia, then put in the CIA.
[02:01:32.854 --> 02:01:33.795]  I mean, she's really bad.
[02:01:33.795 --> 02:01:34.755]  I'm not talking about her anymore.
[02:01:34.755 --> 02:01:35.515]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:01:35.515 --> 02:01:38.037]  I apologize, but at least we got them loaded up here.
[02:01:38.037 --> 02:01:43.519]  Brandon and Jess and Ralph and Matt and Kurt and Danny and Alan and Chris and Jeff and Chris.
[02:01:43.519 --> 02:01:45.740]  We'll at least get to all those callers.
[02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:51.563]  Let's go ahead now and let's talk to Brandon in Washington, D.C.
[02:01:51.563 --> 02:01:53.684]  from Deep in the Swamp.
[02:01:53.684 --> 02:01:54.084]  Thank you.
[02:01:54.084 --> 02:01:55.465]  What is your view of all this happening?
[02:01:56.513 --> 02:02:16.346]  Hey Alex, I go to Georgetown University and I was down by the Capitol yesterday and they had Marines standing by and I was asking what was going on and they said they were doing a drill and it was basically a riot control drill and this is on the heel.
[02:02:16.346 --> 02:02:24.071]  Yesterday was the vote whether or not they're going to move forward with the impeachment inquiry and then as I was leaving I saw
[02:02:24.714 --> 02:02:44.750]  FBI agents directing the whole thing and I shot video on my phone and they approached me and told me to delete it and I asked them if they were detaining me and they said that under the NDAA they don't need to read me my rights or formally charge me to detain me unless I deleted the video.
[02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:47.633]  This is insane!
[02:02:47.633 --> 02:02:51.216]  Well, they're under orders and
[02:02:53.337 --> 02:02:55.649]  The problem is going into a real national emergency.
[02:02:57.679 --> 02:02:59.080]  You could argue that's constitutional.
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:03.224]  I'm not defending it, but I'm telling you, I know people that have talked to Trump.
[02:03:03.224 --> 02:03:05.245]  He plans to call the Marines out.
[02:03:05.245 --> 02:03:10.149]  If this impeachment is done by the book, and the Senate removes him, he will go.
[02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:14.994]  But if any of his rights are violated, or our rights are violated, he has the Marines standing by.
[02:03:14.994 --> 02:03:20.878]  And that's why I think Gohmert's talking about a shooting war, and how the Democrats are pushing us into a shooting war.
[02:03:20.878 --> 02:03:23.220]  Because I'm telling you, those discussions are now being had.
[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:24.882]  That's how much trouble the country is in, brother.
[02:03:25.859 --> 02:03:31.042]  And Alex, uh, I have, I have family who work high level in the Pentagon.
[02:03:31.042 --> 02:03:33.003]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:03:33.003 --> 02:03:42.108]  And one of my uncles who's retired Marine Corps was telling me that don't be surprised if Trump activates the U.S.
[02:03:42.108 --> 02:03:44.570]  Marine Corps to arrest these people.
[02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:53.555]  And if you start seeing televised treason trials in the Senate, because these people are playing with Trump and he's not playing around.
[02:03:54.164 --> 02:04:01.631]  These people have lost their mind thinking that they're going to have some type of coup d'etat in America.
[02:04:01.631 --> 02:04:09.398]  And why do you think Gohmert got up and said, I don't want this to happen, but you're entering physical war territory.
[02:04:09.398 --> 02:04:10.960]  You're entering a place with weapons.
[02:04:12.566 --> 02:04:21.112]  Yeah, and to everybody listening, I just want to say, you better get right with God, and you better choose a side, because we ain't in Kansas anymore.
[02:04:21.112 --> 02:04:24.874]  Stay there, because I get so out of my mind angry at things.
[02:04:24.874 --> 02:04:27.416]  I didn't look at all these callers and a lot of important things.
[02:04:27.416 --> 02:04:30.138]  I want you to just calm down, because I'm excited too.
[02:04:30.138 --> 02:04:31.539]  You're even more upset than I am.
[02:04:31.539 --> 02:04:33.840]  I understand why.
[02:04:33.840 --> 02:04:37.322]  But when we come back, I want you to
[02:04:38.638 --> 02:04:39.839]  Just slowly.
[02:04:39.839 --> 02:04:40.479]  Spend a few minutes.
[02:04:40.479 --> 02:04:44.042]  I know the other callers are happy to hold to hear you.
[02:04:44.042 --> 02:04:48.706]  And just lay out what you witnessed, what you saw, what they said to you.
[02:04:48.706 --> 02:04:55.611]  And then I'm getting the articles from a month ago when Trump did call the Marines up for domestic national crisis.
[02:04:55.611 --> 02:04:56.712]  Now, really unprecedented.
[02:04:56.712 --> 02:04:58.733]  And we've had experts look at it.
[02:04:58.733 --> 02:05:00.134]  They say, no, this is unprecedented.
[02:05:00.134 --> 02:05:01.956]  So, Brandon, don't hang up back in 60 seconds.
[02:05:06.574 --> 02:05:10.258]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[02:05:10.258 --> 02:05:18.247]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[02:05:18.247 --> 02:05:20.830]  It's just that simple.
[02:05:20.830 --> 02:05:27.237]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[02:05:27.237 --> 02:05:27.758]  Others like
[02:05:28.318 --> 02:05:30.420]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:31.140]  Get both.
[02:05:31.140 --> 02:05:32.601]  They're both great for you.
[02:05:32.601 --> 02:05:37.025]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[02:05:37.025 --> 02:05:39.226]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[02:05:39.226 --> 02:05:40.587]  That's why I harp on it.
[02:05:40.587 --> 02:05:44.751]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[02:05:44.751 --> 02:05:48.013]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long.
[02:05:48.013 --> 02:05:48.754]  It's simple.
[02:05:48.754 --> 02:05:52.977]  Get your high-quality iodine at InfoWarsTore.com and help fund the InfoWar.
[02:05:53.337 --> 02:05:55.462]  InfowarStore.com.
[02:05:55.462 --> 02:05:58.147]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[02:05:58.147 --> 02:05:59.971]  It's the Iodine Challenge.
[02:05:59.971 --> 02:06:02.777]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[02:06:17.566 --> 02:06:24.589]  And it's about to push this country to a civil war if they were to get their wishes.
[02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:33.953]  And if there's one thing I don't want to see in my lifetime, I don't want to ever have participation in, it's a civil war.
[02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:42.297]  Some historian, I don't remember who, said guns are only involved in the last phase of a civil war.
[02:06:44.244 --> 02:06:48.687]  What's gone on here has not protected the Constitution.
[02:06:48.687 --> 02:06:51.670]  It's not protected the institutions.
[02:06:51.670 --> 02:06:55.953]  It's not protected this little experiment in self-government.
[02:06:55.953 --> 02:07:01.337]  No, what it has done has put it all at risk.
[02:07:01.337 --> 02:07:03.599]  It's Friday, November 1st, 2019.
[02:07:03.599 --> 02:07:06.281]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:07:06.281 --> 02:07:11.906]  There's been a silent war taking out members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, that tried to empower the people and promote populism.
[02:07:12.995 --> 02:07:15.456]  The Democratic Party, though, now is the main engine of evil.
[02:07:15.456 --> 02:07:17.997]  There's a lot of neocons being kicked out.
[02:07:17.997 --> 02:07:24.199]  But here's the report from October 5th, 2019, a little less than a month ago.
[02:07:24.199 --> 02:07:25.959]  Exclusive, Trump activates U.S.
[02:07:25.959 --> 02:07:32.202]  Marine Reserves for emergency within the United States to stop illegal coup.
[02:07:32.202 --> 02:07:35.783]  And we've since had a talk with folks at the highest levels.
[02:07:37.262 --> 02:07:37.482]  of course.
[02:07:55.888 --> 02:08:19.448]  In control of one half of the legislative branch, are openly working for foreign powers, exactly what they project onto Trump and yours truly, and others that are loyal, informed, conscientious Americans, who also saw the threat and built our own platforms to resist.
[02:08:19.448 --> 02:08:21.790]  So, Brandon called in, Washington D.C.,
[02:08:23.126 --> 02:08:33.790]  And I want him to recap, because some stations don't care that first five minutes, what he saw, what unfolded, and to take his time, because it mirrors what we see here.
[02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:36.131]  And we'll also look into local news in D.C.
[02:08:36.131 --> 02:08:37.651]  about any marine drills.
[02:08:37.651 --> 02:08:42.733]  But I already have witnessed increased marine presence when the president flies around the United States.
[02:08:42.733 --> 02:08:50.376]  So we know this is going on, but to physically see it, and then what the FBI said to you is amazing, Brandon.
[02:08:50.376 --> 02:08:52.297]  So please repeat what you said.
[02:08:55.034 --> 02:09:24.573]  Yes Alex, I was at the National Mall and I saw what had to easily have been 200 to maybe 300 Marines and they were conducting drills but the people that were running the show were FBI agents and I had filmed some video after talking to one of the Marines there and he said that they were doing a drill for civil unrest, more specifically in the case of looters, riots,
[02:09:25.905 --> 02:09:30.429]  Pretty much a Ferguson or Baltimore type of situation.
[02:09:30.429 --> 02:09:39.296]  And this was the day that they took the vote in the House on whether or not they were going to impeach Trump or move forward with it.
[02:09:39.296 --> 02:09:53.147]  As I was leaving to get on the train to go back home, I was approached by two FBI agents who basically took my phone, threw me up against the wall, and I asked them if I was under arrest.
[02:09:54.423 --> 02:09:58.624]  He told me that I don't have to read you your rights.
[02:09:58.624 --> 02:10:02.225]  I don't have to tell you if you're formally charged with anything under the NDAA.
[02:10:02.225 --> 02:10:05.426]  We can detain you for as long as we want.
[02:10:05.426 --> 02:10:19.010]  And from talking to family members who work in the Pentagon, they have told me that to not be surprised if Trump activates the Marine Corps and arrests these people.
[02:10:19.010 --> 02:10:23.051]  And if I start seeing televised treason trials in the Senate,
[02:10:23.686 --> 02:10:26.947]  Because what they're doing is treason by every sense of the word.
[02:10:26.947 --> 02:10:29.367]  And Trump's not playing around with them.
[02:10:29.367 --> 02:10:31.908]  Now, is that what you're saying, or is that what your family in the Pentagon said?
[02:10:31.908 --> 02:10:35.668]  That's what my family in the Pentagon said.
[02:10:35.668 --> 02:10:38.109]  Well, I mean, here's the issue.
[02:10:38.109 --> 02:10:40.989]  They're violating due process and laws flagrantly.
[02:10:40.989 --> 02:10:45.070]  They're the ones in bed with Russia and China and have been caught selling us out.
[02:10:45.070 --> 02:10:47.511]  And they keep putting forward fraud.
[02:10:47.511 --> 02:10:49.891]  And they're saying intimidate the American people.
[02:10:49.891 --> 02:10:52.892]  And they're taking thousands of prominent conservatives' bank accounts away.
[02:10:53.997 --> 02:10:57.339]  They're trying to shut down the NRA.
[02:10:57.339 --> 02:11:08.884]  They have activated large portions of the CIA, mainly, through foundations to harass patriot leaders and to harass Trump's family and companies.
[02:11:08.884 --> 02:11:14.006]  And so they're pushing a Cold War that's now getting hot.
[02:11:14.006 --> 02:11:19.068]  And so it's a dereliction of duty if Trump doesn't start taking action.
[02:11:19.068 --> 02:11:20.769]  The problem is the Justice Department
[02:11:22.225 --> 02:11:26.829]  It's so full of lawyers and people appointed by the deep state by Bush and Bush Sr.
[02:11:26.829 --> 02:11:29.311]  and the Clintons and Obama that they're a bunch of cowards.
[02:11:29.311 --> 02:11:40.321]  Trump believes the Marines, just like they did in the Nazis almost overthrew Roosevelt, and then it was the Marines were secretly activated and the Nazis were arrested and it was kept quiet for morale issues.
[02:11:40.321 --> 02:11:44.565]  But I can tell you, I mean, it's in the McCormick-Dickstein Committee hearings, they didn't publish all of it.
[02:11:45.822 --> 02:11:48.644]  More than 5,000 people got killed.
[02:11:48.644 --> 02:11:50.686]  The Marines just killed people.
[02:11:50.686 --> 02:11:55.350]  The president will issue death warrants, and then they'll just go out and start killing people.
[02:11:55.350 --> 02:12:00.354]  And so, that's super dangerous too, but that's where the globalists have taken this country.
[02:12:01.753 --> 02:12:03.615]  And it's just crazy.
[02:12:03.615 --> 02:12:17.311]  Now, the Bushes jumped back right before this started and said, OK, we're sorry, we won't be with the Nazis anymore, and Brown Brother Harriman, and we'll make a deal with you, and we'll start the pro-troop movements and all this stuff.
[02:12:17.311 --> 02:12:19.814]  And guaranteed, Trump's given all these people a chance.
[02:12:20.515 --> 02:12:23.117]  To stop going along with this attempted coup against America.
[02:12:23.117 --> 02:12:26.099]  Because it's not just about taking out Trump, that's only part of it.
[02:12:26.099 --> 02:12:31.362]  It's about fully getting their foot back on the neck of America, and that's why this is so dangerous.
[02:12:31.362 --> 02:12:32.783]  What were the Marines doing?
[02:12:32.783 --> 02:12:35.105]  Just, like, practicing for rioting?
[02:12:35.105 --> 02:12:37.426]  I mean, specifically, what did you see them doing?
[02:12:37.426 --> 02:12:46.993]  They had riot shield, and they also had, uh, I also saw a UN, like, they had the UN letters in white on the
[02:12:47.725 --> 02:12:51.387]  Millet armored vehicles, so I'm wait a minute.
[02:12:51.387 --> 02:13:14.016]  You're saying you saw you in vehicles And the Marines were basically they had riot shield and it looked like role players that they were basically detaining and This was right in plain sight and people were walking by like it was almost normal and so
[02:13:16.033 --> 02:13:21.435]  I'm not really sure if the Marines have been given the green light by President Trump.
[02:13:21.435 --> 02:13:21.895]  Well, no.
[02:13:21.895 --> 02:13:25.017]  I mean, obviously they'd be going into the Capitol and grabbing people.
[02:13:25.017 --> 02:13:28.998]  That just shows how crazy this is.
[02:13:28.998 --> 02:13:31.619]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:13:31.619 --> 02:13:33.020]  Yeah.
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:40.543]  I just can't believe how normal those FBI agents talked about basically disappearing me.
[02:13:40.543 --> 02:13:41.623]  No judge, no jury.
[02:13:42.054 --> 02:13:45.116]  And it makes me wonder, what are they doing going along with this?
[02:13:45.116 --> 02:13:48.898]  Because they're going to be the first ones the deep state kills once they get power.
[02:13:48.898 --> 02:13:57.424]  Sure, because, I mean, if you're saying you saw UN vehicles, and I'm not saying you're lying, but we haven't confirmed this, we don't know if it's true, then that would be some UN operation.
[02:13:57.424 --> 02:14:00.326]  But if the Marines were involved, the President would have learned of this.
[02:14:00.326 --> 02:14:03.167]  So, I really appreciate your call, sir.
[02:14:03.167 --> 02:14:08.711]  We need people to get footage of stuff like that, and there's ways to do it.
[02:14:08.711 --> 02:14:10.132]  Obviously, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:14:11.923 --> 02:14:15.224]  We just go with the facts here, and we know that Trump has activated U.S.
[02:14:15.224 --> 02:14:22.807]  Marine reserves for emergency within the United States to stop illegal coup, and we will repost that article to the front of InfoWars.com.
[02:14:22.807 --> 02:14:23.227]  I've got to break.
[02:14:23.227 --> 02:14:26.468]  I'm going to come back and go to callers quicker, but thank you, Brandon.
[02:14:26.468 --> 02:14:28.489]  Here's some drone footage of U.N.
[02:14:28.489 --> 02:14:31.110]  vehicles in the U.S.
[02:14:31.110 --> 02:14:33.610]  that were being prepared, but that was for overseas.
[02:14:33.610 --> 02:14:35.191]  There are plans to try to use the U.N.
[02:14:35.191 --> 02:14:36.191]  inside the United States.
[02:14:36.191 --> 02:14:38.052]  Obama openly announced that.
[02:14:38.052 --> 02:14:40.593]  The strong city initiatives have them police the police.
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:45.703]  But we don't know the specifics of what the caller was talking about.
[02:14:45.703 --> 02:14:46.423]  I'm not doubting him.
[02:14:46.423 --> 02:14:49.065]  I'm not saying he's a liar.
[02:14:49.065 --> 02:14:56.111]  I'm simply saying people will run with a rumor like that instead of going, whoa, Trump's had to activate the Marines for civil unrest.
[02:14:56.111 --> 02:14:57.232]  It's unprecedented.
[02:14:57.232 --> 02:14:59.874]  That was almost a month ago.
[02:14:59.874 --> 02:15:00.955]  But let's expand on that.
[02:15:04.042 --> 02:15:06.363]  We know they're having a sham trial.
[02:15:06.363 --> 02:15:07.924]  We know they're railroading.
[02:15:07.924 --> 02:15:09.425]  We know they're twisting arms.
[02:15:09.425 --> 02:15:14.248]  We know they're using spy agencies illegally to spy on the president and then leak this info.
[02:15:14.248 --> 02:15:17.730]  So we're already in a civil war inside the government.
[02:15:17.730 --> 02:15:23.773]  The shooting just comes at the end and I want to avert that, as Congressman Gohmert was saying, I totally agree with that.
[02:15:23.773 --> 02:15:30.016]  But without speculation or without believing that caller, that is the world we're in now.
[02:15:30.016 --> 02:15:30.857]  That's the wheelhouse.
[02:15:32.119 --> 02:15:42.306]  Show, very serious situation and that's another reason I want a bigger budget to have a full-time DC Bureau of at least three people to catch all the craziness going on up there.
[02:15:42.306 --> 02:15:50.451]  That's why when you buy the products, InfoWarsTore.com, we can go from being tenuous to even stay at this size to expanding in 2020, which is so critical.
[02:15:50.451 --> 02:15:56.014]  That's why we have the everything must go sale that ends by Monday because I've had a weird feeling that 2020 isn't even going to happen.
[02:15:56.014 --> 02:15:58.956]  They're trying to take Trump out now and you now see it happening.
[02:15:58.956 --> 02:15:59.757]  You see?
[02:15:59.757 --> 02:16:01.458]  InfoWarsTore.com, thank you for the support.
[02:16:04.136 --> 02:16:06.778]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[02:16:06.778 --> 02:16:15.323]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:16:15.323 --> 02:16:24.508]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:16:24.608 --> 02:16:29.910]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:42.094]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[02:16:42.094 --> 02:16:43.354]  So here's what you should do right now.
[02:16:43.354 --> 02:16:45.335]  Check out the PPX Microgrid system

[02:20:26.569 --> 02:20:29.430]  The way we've always done before.
[02:20:29.430 --> 02:20:33.512]  Look in the dark we've followed.
[02:20:33.512 --> 02:20:36.233]  Look at the leaders we've followed.
[02:20:36.233 --> 02:20:40.875]  Look at the lives we've swallowed.
[02:20:40.875 --> 02:20:43.676]  And I don't wanna hear no more.
[02:21:21.229 --> 02:21:22.590]  Civil War!
[02:21:22.590 --> 02:21:25.412]  With the faction that supports the globalists at the end of America.
[02:21:25.412 --> 02:21:27.814]  The faction that wants to be a good, decent, successful nation.
[02:21:29.065 --> 02:21:49.971]  Allen in Colorado on the side of Hillary and civil war and Republicans saying we're in a civil war they've got armed men not letting us into secret fake hearings where they coach everybody and they're saying that they're gonna remove everybody all the judges Trump put in everything they're gonna stop America and stop the election 2016 and stop 2020 because they know that
[02:21:54.366 --> 02:21:55.367]  Trump is going to win 2020.
[02:21:55.367 --> 02:21:56.487]  His poll numbers go up, up, up.
[02:21:56.487 --> 02:21:57.928]  People say, oh good!
[02:21:57.928 --> 02:21:59.229]  He's raising lots of money.
[02:21:59.229 --> 02:22:01.550]  Oh!
[02:22:01.550 --> 02:22:03.872]  Internal polls show he's way up with this fake impeachment.
[02:22:03.872 --> 02:22:07.114]  They don't care!
[02:22:07.114 --> 02:22:09.776]  That's why they have to be dealt with.
[02:22:09.776 --> 02:22:10.996]  We're having a discussion about that.
[02:22:10.996 --> 02:22:11.657]  Alan, what do you think?
[02:22:11.657 --> 02:22:13.878]  And thanks for calling on Friday.
[02:22:13.878 --> 02:22:15.079]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:22:15.079 --> 02:22:16.260]  I'm good, brother.
[02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:20.362]  I've been listening to you for 18 years and been with you since the beginning after 9-1-1.
[02:22:23.096 --> 02:22:25.098]  I guess I just want to discuss two points.
[02:22:25.098 --> 02:22:26.099]  First one with Hillary.
[02:22:26.099 --> 02:22:39.734]  About a year ago, I was looking through the channels and one of the news stations, I can't remember which one it was, they had the president of Haiti on there just bashing the Clintons about how they stole money and all this other stuff.
[02:22:40.647 --> 02:22:46.890]  And I don't know if you knew about this already, but it just seems to me you guys could find that clip and just play it over and over again.
[02:22:46.890 --> 02:22:53.754]  Oh, we sent crews to Haiti right after the hurricane hit, and we interviewed state senators and others about the missing kids.
[02:22:53.754 --> 02:23:01.998]  You know, when I say Hillary and these people have tables full of flesh and blood and semen, that's in the emails.
[02:23:01.998 --> 02:23:05.260]  That we have the semen and the milk and other goodies for you.
[02:23:05.260 --> 02:23:09.842]  And normal people go, that just doesn't sound right.
[02:23:10.984 --> 02:23:12.304]  Because it's not right.
[02:23:12.304 --> 02:23:16.505]  It's like HBO is promoting sex with earthworms now.
[02:23:16.505 --> 02:23:19.846]  They're doing it to degradate us and prepare us for horrors.
[02:23:19.846 --> 02:23:24.226]  They're doing it to program us and to condition us for horrible things that are coming.
[02:23:24.226 --> 02:23:28.987]  That's in the declassified CIA documents.
[02:23:28.987 --> 02:23:31.628]  How do you think we stop this?
[02:23:31.628 --> 02:23:32.348]  I have no idea.
[02:23:32.348 --> 02:23:38.289]  I mean, to me, just eating fine clips like that and just playing them over and over again just to show it.
[02:23:39.335 --> 02:23:51.682]  You know, how bad that the Clintons have destroyed Haiti, you know, and, you know, we've discussed about if the civil war is coming and the Democrats do get this coup or civil war that they want.
[02:23:51.682 --> 02:23:55.404]  What I'm kind of curious about is, is who's going to follow through for these people?
[02:23:55.404 --> 02:24:05.329]  Because every liberal I know, like, runs from the sight of a gun, works for education, government or social organizations.
[02:24:06.031 --> 02:24:08.853]  And, you know, we're just completely just emasculated.
[02:24:08.853 --> 02:24:17.697]  So I'm just, you know, to me it seems like... They think they're going to put out, let me tell you, I don't want your view on this, they think they're going to put out a script how it's us being violent.
[02:24:17.697 --> 02:24:29.344]  They're going to have people stage false flags, like the last two guys that admitted Antifa, did it to get the guns, and then they'll try to trick the apparatus of the military and police to do their jobs for them.
[02:24:29.344 --> 02:24:30.604]  They never do the work.
[02:24:30.604 --> 02:24:34.507]  They trick people like magicians with tricks to do their bidding.
[02:24:34.507 --> 02:24:35.067]  Does that make sense?
[02:24:37.677 --> 02:24:38.577]  Come down to guns.
[02:24:38.577 --> 02:24:43.298]  I mean, if you think about, you know, you got the trucking business, the farming business.
[02:24:43.298 --> 02:24:44.598]  I mean, all the blue collar work.
[02:24:44.598 --> 02:24:48.119]  I mean, we could shut this country down, you know, in a day.
[02:24:48.119 --> 02:24:50.799]  I know, but here's what they have us off the air on most areas.
[02:24:50.799 --> 02:24:54.460]  People don't know who the enemy is, but people are getting the word.
[02:24:54.460 --> 02:24:59.921]  And that's why getting the word out through underground networks to everybody about we don't want violence.
[02:24:59.921 --> 02:25:01.541]  We don't want to have a physical civil war.
[02:25:01.541 --> 02:25:05.862]  But if they start coming after our leaders or they start grabbing people, everybody
[02:25:07.533 --> 02:25:16.644]  It's called moose hunting, and you know up north, ten guys might put in a ticket to get a moose tag, but only one guy gets to go hunt moose.
[02:25:16.644 --> 02:25:17.866]  I mean, exactly.
[02:25:17.866 --> 02:25:21.230]  If we move against them, everybody just picks a moose.
[02:25:22.191 --> 02:25:23.192]  You don't want to do anything violent.
[02:25:23.192 --> 02:25:24.132]  You said they get violent.
[02:25:24.132 --> 02:25:31.676]  There's a moose picked and then you know what happens and and then somebody goes does one thing in their life and they never do anything again.
[02:25:31.676 --> 02:25:33.597]  All of our enemies are wiped out right there.
[02:25:33.597 --> 02:25:35.578]  So I totally agree and I don't want to talk about this stuff.
[02:25:35.578 --> 02:25:37.459]  I mean I I know all about it.
[02:25:37.459 --> 02:25:38.579]  You know all about it.
[02:25:38.579 --> 02:25:39.500]  Everybody can research it.
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:42.181]  We can get you know caught up on that as our study stuff.
[02:25:42.181 --> 02:25:45.143]  We don't want to go there because before we have to think about
[02:25:47.041 --> 02:25:48.382]  I don't know.
[02:25:48.382 --> 02:25:50.563]  All I know is I feel like the people have the power.
[02:25:50.563 --> 02:25:58.729]  I mean, you know, the people that are in these high positions really can't even fill up their own gas tank or buy their own food, so I'm just kind of curious to how they're gonna
[02:26:11.365 --> 02:26:12.985]  You know, implement something like this.
[02:26:12.985 --> 02:26:17.707]  I mean, if we're supposed to go after these global leaders, why aren't we going after these global leaders?
[02:26:17.707 --> 02:26:23.328]  Why aren't we, like, you know, you have one of your guests saying, you know, if he tells us to go get Soros, we'll go get him.
[02:26:23.328 --> 02:26:24.669]  Why aren't we going to get him?
[02:26:24.669 --> 02:26:28.490]  I mean, it's like, let's just cut off, cut the head off the snake and just do this.
[02:26:28.490 --> 02:26:29.910]  You know, why are we getting to the point where we're at?
[02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:30.550]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:35.032]  Soros has handed things over to Alexander Soros, and then they've got all these foundations funded.
[02:26:35.032 --> 02:26:39.093]  If something happens to them, it continues on, and they would spend that into them being martyrs.
[02:26:39.773 --> 02:26:48.780]  Instead, we want to assassinate their name, which they're doing to me, and destroy their name, take them, and then use them as a symbol of what they are, the enemy.
[02:26:48.780 --> 02:26:51.442]  Soros is a negative to their movement now.
[02:26:51.442 --> 02:27:02.010]  And again, I'm not evil, but they've taken me, made me evil to their people, and I'm a captured signet, at least at their level, that they believe they've turned towards their use.
[02:27:02.010 --> 02:27:06.013]  They've failed, which means they might do the other thing, which is, you know, fine.
[02:27:06.013 --> 02:27:08.775]  If I see it coming, I'll resist it, but I'm not too worried about it, quite frankly.
[02:27:10.636 --> 02:27:15.997]  So, so again sir, I hear what you're saying and I'm not going to tell you what to do, but here's the thing.
[02:27:15.997 --> 02:27:20.998]  They're going to start more false flags against themselves, so we're never going to just shoot random innocent cops.
[02:27:20.998 --> 02:27:22.699]  We're not going to attack the military.
[02:27:22.699 --> 02:27:28.400]  We're not going to go after, you know, notice always the terror attacks are some innocent group getting hit because it's terrorists.
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:32.121]  But if things do get brutal, I hope that doesn't happen.
[02:27:32.121 --> 02:27:37.322]  I'm not saying do it, but there needs to be political command and control targets.
[02:27:38.567 --> 02:27:41.049]  Political command and control targets.
[02:27:41.049 --> 02:27:53.139]  But don't worry, we are showing our strength, and we have woken up and educated people throughout every system you can imagine, and they're going to make the decision, if this goes much further, to decapitate the globalists for us.
[02:27:53.139 --> 02:27:55.200]  We're very close, believe me.
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:55.601]  Believe me.
[02:27:56.741 --> 02:27:59.764]  You need to be ready in case we fail.
[02:27:59.764 --> 02:28:02.045]  I mean, folks, higher levels.
[02:28:02.045 --> 02:28:03.986]  But we're not going to fail, my friend.
[02:28:03.986 --> 02:28:09.290]  Now, it's a failure if we have to decapitate these individuals.
[02:28:09.290 --> 02:28:12.772]  We don't want to go there, but believe me, that's prepared.
[02:28:12.772 --> 02:28:13.553]  You can believe it.
[02:28:13.553 --> 02:28:14.554]  Santa Claus has got a list.
[02:28:15.294 --> 02:28:16.335]  And I'm not Santa Claus.
[02:28:16.335 --> 02:28:17.115]  I'm not even an elf.
[02:28:17.115 --> 02:28:20.798]  I'm just telling you, Santa Claus has got that going on.
[02:28:20.798 --> 02:28:22.699]  And Mrs. Santa Claus and a lot of other folks.
[02:28:22.699 --> 02:28:28.623]  I mean, these guys have no idea sitting right next to them are people waiting for the order.
[02:28:28.623 --> 02:28:30.605]  Right next to them that are cooking their food.
[02:28:31.618 --> 02:28:36.299]  Taking care of their kids, driving their cars, are watching them right now, brother.
[02:28:36.299 --> 02:28:37.500]  This is America!
[02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:38.920]  We don't go down easy!
[02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:45.802]  They may have gotten all the lemmings brainwashed, that may make them look strong, but we have the giant underground force army ready!
[02:28:45.802 --> 02:28:46.162]  Believe it!
[02:28:46.162 --> 02:28:48.442]  I mean, what do you think?
[02:28:48.442 --> 02:28:50.663]  Infowars just popped up out of a jack-in-the-box?
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:56.644]  I wasn't backed by anybody because the very soil is full of it!
[02:28:56.644 --> 02:29:02.370]  And if you think Alex Jones is dangerous, there are new people coming up, even stronger!
[02:29:04.201 --> 02:29:15.389]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:15.389 --> 02:29:24.696]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's gonna let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:29:24.696 --> 02:29:30.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:30.520]  Because of the
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:30.961]  I think so.

[02:31:07.806 --> 02:31:10.609]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[02:31:10.609 --> 02:31:13.631]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[02:31:13.631 --> 02:31:19.296]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something you don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[02:31:20.357 --> 02:31:29.464]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life completely changes.

[02:31:30.204 --> 02:31:31.545]  I have more energy.
[02:31:31.545 --> 02:31:32.386]  I lose weight.
[02:31:32.386 --> 02:31:33.166]  I look better.
[02:31:33.166 --> 02:31:34.707]  Everybody notices.

[02:32:05.089 --> 02:32:05.829]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[02:32:06.149 --> 02:32:07.231]  Hey, Alex!
[02:32:07.231 --> 02:32:08.572]  Oh my God!
[02:32:08.572 --> 02:32:11.376]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[02:32:11.376 --> 02:32:14.000]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:17.825]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June.
[02:32:17.825 --> 02:32:21.530]  And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[02:32:21.530 --> 02:32:22.531]  Let me tell you something, man.
[02:32:22.831 --> 02:32:28.034]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years.
[02:32:28.034 --> 02:32:30.256]  And the doctors, they tried every test.
[02:32:30.256 --> 02:32:32.037]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[02:32:32.037 --> 02:32:36.020]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[02:32:36.020 --> 02:32:38.401]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[02:32:38.401 --> 02:32:42.904]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have it, but I ordered it and had it shipped.
[02:32:43.124 --> 02:32:44.885]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:32.521 --> 02:33:35.103]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:35.103 --> 02:33:47.352]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:47.352 --> 02:33:55.578]  Well, you lived to see the Chi-Coms and the Hollywood scum and the New World Order take a real run in America.
[02:33:56.445 --> 02:34:00.006]  They thought they had it, we just sleepwalk into total collapse.
[02:34:00.006 --> 02:34:06.689]  But at the last minute, enough patriots in the public and in the government just said, this is insane.
[02:34:06.689 --> 02:34:09.950]  Even pragmatists said that this is destructive.
[02:34:09.950 --> 02:34:14.431]  Even sociopaths went, this is wrong, unless you're a satanist.
[02:34:14.431 --> 02:34:18.513]  Unless you really like to mess good things up.
[02:34:18.513 --> 02:34:21.594]  You know, like just burning down a mansion for no reason.
[02:34:22.830 --> 02:34:25.931]  Or feeding a kid through a wood chipper, because you like it, it makes you feel big.
[02:34:25.931 --> 02:34:29.412]  Well, it doesn't make me feel big.
[02:34:29.412 --> 02:34:31.853]  It makes me want to hurt the people doing it, because I have that instinct.
[02:34:31.853 --> 02:34:42.757]  See, I'm not a person who likes to hurt people, until they have it coming, and then... Yeah, I actually do enjoy it.
[02:34:42.757 --> 02:34:50.159]  But I like taking big, powerful people who think they are in command, who like to bully people, and I like to hurt them.
[02:34:50.159 --> 02:34:51.180]  But what I like to really do,
[02:34:52.418 --> 02:34:54.059]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:34:54.059 --> 02:34:56.000]  I think if they pull off impeachment, whether or not it's so-called legal,
[02:35:22.125 --> 02:35:32.749]  As the little people, which the elites like to call us, the first thing we need to do is, number one, pull everyone's kids out of public schools and go on a tax strike immediately.
[02:35:32.749 --> 02:35:36.630]  Oh, yeah, they'll hate that.
[02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:41.211]  And I get most people can't afford to even do that, but you can do it as a strike.
[02:35:41.211 --> 02:35:42.152]  Right, exactly.
[02:35:42.152 --> 02:35:51.535]  And, you know, everyone with a small business, you know, everyone that if you haven't been having your W-4 withholding, file for an extension.
[02:35:52.139 --> 02:35:53.360]  Immediate tax strike.
[02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:55.240]  Pull your kids out of school.
[02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:56.161]  I don't know what else to do.
[02:35:56.161 --> 02:35:58.922]  I mean, we're, uh... Well, I know this.
[02:35:58.922 --> 02:36:04.284]  The left starts going around to people's houses like Tucker Carlson and starts killing people.
[02:36:04.284 --> 02:36:04.664]  Oh, yeah.
[02:36:04.664 --> 02:36:07.365]  Folks don't need to go find the Antifa and kill them.
[02:36:07.365 --> 02:36:15.148]  The people that have been saying Antifa's good and giving the orders on the news need to get whatever Antifa does to people needs to happen to them.
[02:36:15.148 --> 02:36:17.009]  An eye for an eye.
[02:36:17.009 --> 02:36:18.190]  Absolutely.
[02:36:18.190 --> 02:36:20.030]  And these lizards in suits, man.
[02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:21.291]  Like, they've been trying to trick us.
[02:36:21.897 --> 02:36:24.319]  Into fighting each other for a long time.
[02:36:24.319 --> 02:36:25.199]  It's an old trick.
[02:36:25.199 --> 02:36:26.520]  It's not a new trick.
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:27.521]  It's an old trick.
[02:36:27.521 --> 02:36:29.842]  And if they pull it off, we all lose.
[02:36:29.842 --> 02:36:30.403]  No, you're right.
[02:36:30.403 --> 02:36:37.487]  You can see how they're trying to cause racial division, and Trump's been trying to counter it.
[02:36:37.487 --> 02:36:38.528]  It's so obvious now.
[02:36:38.528 --> 02:36:45.733]  I mean, you wouldn't believe how many people I talked to that last year were like, a little bit anti-gun, a little bit this, a little bit that, are now like, oh, crap, dude.
[02:36:45.733 --> 02:36:46.933]  We gotta keep our guns.
[02:36:46.933 --> 02:36:49.195]  Like, we gotta pull our kids out of these public schools.
[02:36:49.949 --> 02:36:52.813]  Yeah, everyone sees what's going on.
[02:36:52.813 --> 02:36:59.521]  I've been researching this stuff for a long time and I've never seen this many people like to know what's going on.
[02:37:01.038 --> 02:37:02.780]  Kurt, you're awesome, and let me just say this.
[02:37:02.780 --> 02:37:10.427]  That's what I'm seeing, and that's why they're purposely censoring us and purposely invoking all this evil in front of us.
[02:37:10.427 --> 02:37:23.781]  Because when you silence someone, as Kennedy said, when you make peaceful revolutions impossible, you make violent revolutions inevitable, they're really trying to get us to be violent because we hear the children screaming under the weight of these monsters.
[02:37:25.256 --> 02:37:29.959]  They want to trick us into a precipitous action because we're winning the information war.
[02:37:29.959 --> 02:37:32.301]  And I wouldn't just say that if it wasn't true, folks.
[02:37:32.301 --> 02:37:33.581]  We can all see it.
[02:37:33.581 --> 02:37:41.026]  And so we just have to control ourselves and not go out and start killing these people that are running this and doing this.
[02:37:41.026 --> 02:37:46.610]  We have to hold fire and we have to just informationally hammer them as hard as we can.
[02:37:46.610 --> 02:37:47.270]  Absolutely.
[02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:49.572]  And they know they're losing that bet.
[02:37:49.572 --> 02:37:50.152]  They know that.
[02:37:50.152 --> 02:37:52.514]  That's why they're trying to get this into a physical fight.
[02:37:53.411 --> 02:38:01.594]  And, like, everyone needs to understand, like, listen, like, I don't want to give away too much who I am, but I worked on Biden's Secret Service detail when I was in the military.
[02:38:01.594 --> 02:38:05.015]  These lizards behind the curtains, they're monsters.
[02:38:05.015 --> 02:38:09.737]  Just like you always talk about, these people are monsters.
[02:38:09.737 --> 02:38:15.199]  And everyone needs to understand, we give them a third of our money or more, and they don't represent us.
[02:38:15.199 --> 02:38:20.841]  And if they impeach Trump, none of them represent us at that point, and we should not be giving them any of our support.
[02:38:21.351 --> 02:38:21.913]  Any of our money.
[02:38:21.913 --> 02:38:25.746]  We need to cut off their control over our children and over our money.
[02:38:26.544 --> 02:38:34.911]  Well, I was already about to say this, Kirk, as we're starting this new show, we've already done a few of them, where we have some of our best callers host the show, and then they'll open the phones up.
[02:38:34.911 --> 02:38:41.376]  So please, if you want to give us your name and number and host the show sometime as one of those folks, we're getting a bigger list of people so we can do it.
[02:38:41.376 --> 02:38:47.021]  We've got like 10 names, and half of them when we call can't do it, so we need to get like 20, 30 names of folks who want to start that show.
[02:38:47.021 --> 02:38:52.765]  And once we get some people that like to host it routinely, they'll become the main host, maybe three or four of them, and then take calls.
[02:38:52.765 --> 02:38:55.147]  But if you'd like to be involved, please do that.
[02:38:55.888 --> 02:39:02.330]  Getting back to what you were saying about Sina behind the scenes, they don't act like humans.
[02:39:02.330 --> 02:39:04.591]  And I used to hear this 25 years ago and didn't believe it.
[02:39:04.591 --> 02:39:05.891]  I thought, well, they're like sociopaths.
[02:39:05.891 --> 02:39:08.452]  But no, I've talked to a lot of people.
[02:39:08.452 --> 02:39:13.773]  I mean, I personally am friends with three people that have guarded Hillary Clinton repeatedly, long periods of time.
[02:39:13.773 --> 02:39:15.494]  You know, a few of them work here.
[02:39:15.494 --> 02:39:17.775]  And they don't break their agreements to get into all of it.
[02:39:17.775 --> 02:39:21.716]  They go, yeah, no, she's, I mean, it's just like, she is unbelievable.
[02:39:21.716 --> 02:39:25.237]  And that's, and it's exactly what you're talking about.
[02:39:26.476 --> 02:39:29.997]  Where she'll just like go into a trance for like an hour in a corner like she's a lizard.
[02:39:29.997 --> 02:39:31.998]  Just turn off sitting up.
[02:39:31.998 --> 02:39:35.919]  Turn with her eyes open or she'll just start going, I hate you.
[02:39:35.919 --> 02:39:36.959]  Just like freaking out.
[02:39:36.959 --> 02:39:42.341]  Or if she sees a dog, she'll go and sometimes flop around on the ground chewing carpet.
[02:39:42.341 --> 02:39:45.302]  I mean, and folks, this isn't normal human behavior.
[02:39:45.302 --> 02:39:47.583]  It's not like they get mad or angry or whatever.
[02:39:47.583 --> 02:39:50.464]  They are like robots, except sometimes they blow up.
[02:39:51.384 --> 02:40:00.653]  And they are tirelessly trying to hurt people, implode civilization, sabotage humanity, and that's their main mission.
[02:40:00.653 --> 02:40:01.915]  And it's literally biblical.
[02:40:01.915 --> 02:40:03.756]  Is that what you're getting at?
[02:40:03.756 --> 02:40:04.797]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:40:04.797 --> 02:40:06.779]  They hate creation.
[02:40:06.779 --> 02:40:07.860]  They hate life.
[02:40:07.860 --> 02:40:09.061]  They hate happiness.
[02:40:09.061 --> 02:40:10.062]  It's in their ethos.
[02:40:10.062 --> 02:40:13.366]  It's in their religion to destroy it.
[02:40:13.366 --> 02:40:15.648]  And so they don't want us to figure out
[02:40:16.252 --> 02:40:16.732]  We're good to go.
[02:40:47.077 --> 02:40:49.019]  I mean, come on.
[02:40:49.019 --> 02:40:59.655]  I mean, everyone knows, but I just thought I would like confirm that that I've got that from Secret Service and one of my buddies who's been to Biden's house working with Secret Service.
[02:41:00.788 --> 02:41:02.069]  So, yeah.
[02:41:02.069 --> 02:41:10.358]  Well, I mean, what do people think the Secret Service is doing when their whole history they never leaked info and they leaked info to us about Hillary having convulsions because they thought she was so dangerous?
[02:41:10.358 --> 02:41:11.199]  People should know this.
[02:41:11.199 --> 02:41:14.322]  I mean, that's the good news is people have been around these Democrats.
[02:41:14.322 --> 02:41:19.768]  Trump blows up sometimes at people that work for him, high level, that have betrayed him or whatever.
[02:41:19.768 --> 02:41:22.170]  And he calls people wimps and stuff if they say they're tired.
[02:41:22.671 --> 02:41:24.231]  Because he's like crazy, 20 hours a day.
[02:41:24.231 --> 02:41:25.852]  I mean, Trump is a wild man.
[02:41:25.852 --> 02:41:29.133]  But other than that, he's very nice to common people, really nice to his crew.
[02:41:29.133 --> 02:41:31.393]  But these Democrats just treat people like total filth.
[02:41:31.393 --> 02:41:32.094]  That tells you a lot.
[02:41:32.094 --> 02:41:33.194]  Thank you, Kurt.
[02:41:33.194 --> 02:41:34.694]  And I just said I respect the callers.
[02:41:34.694 --> 02:41:36.655]  I'm going to get to more than one in this segment.
[02:41:36.655 --> 02:41:39.256]  But the caller was so good, how could you hang up on him?
[02:41:39.256 --> 02:41:40.956]  I'm going to go to everybody.
[02:41:40.956 --> 02:41:41.956]  Nick baggage is holding.
[02:41:41.956 --> 02:41:43.697]  Let's go to Matt in California.
[02:41:43.697 --> 02:41:44.417]  Matt, you're on the air.
[02:41:44.417 --> 02:41:44.697]  Welcome.
[02:41:52.583 --> 02:41:54.424]  America!
[02:41:54.424 --> 02:41:55.324]  Let's do this.
[02:41:55.324 --> 02:41:56.085]  Listen.
[02:41:56.085 --> 02:42:00.247]  Michael Savage was on today and he is fucking awesome.
[02:42:00.247 --> 02:42:01.828]  Sorry about the swear words.
[02:42:01.828 --> 02:42:02.928]  Pumped up.
[02:42:02.928 --> 02:42:04.869]  You need to have a convention.
[02:42:04.869 --> 02:42:08.671]  All of the people need to get together and we're not talk show hosts anymore.
[02:42:08.671 --> 02:42:15.215]  You are now the founding fathers of We The Sequel, the second American revolution worldwide.
[02:42:15.215 --> 02:42:18.216]  What I actually called in to talk about was something.
[02:42:18.216 --> 02:42:19.857]  Sorry, I'm really pumped up.
[02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:27.444]  I wanted to talk, call in, a long time ago, I've been doing new callers only, so I've been respectful.
[02:42:27.444 --> 02:42:28.745]  Trump needs to change his subject.
[02:42:28.745 --> 02:42:32.066]  He needs to come out and say, the Democrats do nothing.
[02:42:32.066 --> 02:42:34.328]  I want to do something about gun violence.
[02:42:34.328 --> 02:42:38.110]  What I want to do is I want to create a new agency to look into
[02:42:38.988 --> 02:42:40.370]  All of the gun violence problems.
[02:42:40.370 --> 02:42:44.234]  And they will have cart watch to look at all of them.
[02:42:44.234 --> 02:42:50.662]  And that agency would find out 99% of the violence is in their districts under their control and the mass shooters are all antifa devil worshippers.
[02:42:51.844 --> 02:42:57.186]  And we're gonna look into it, and we're gonna find out exactly who they are, and who's putting it all together.
[02:42:57.186 --> 02:43:01.488]  Well, the media knows, like an equation, they hype it, mental patients do it.
[02:43:01.488 --> 02:43:02.048]  Great points, man.
[02:43:02.048 --> 02:43:02.748]  I'm gonna move fast.
[02:43:02.748 --> 02:43:03.969]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[02:43:03.969 --> 02:43:14.893]  We are running the Everything Must Go Super Sale, but it's going to have to end by early next week, because we're selling out of many of our best-selling products, like Ultra 12, the best B12 you're gonna find liquid.
[02:43:14.893 --> 02:43:20.695]  Take it under the tongue, that is 50% off, free shipping, double Patriot points, but it's about to sell out.
[02:43:21.255 --> 02:43:26.457]  Vazo Beats, oh my gosh, with all of the great compounds that are in beet concentrates.
[02:43:26.457 --> 02:43:29.018]  This is a very strong concentrate.
[02:43:29.018 --> 02:43:30.398]  It's 50% off.
[02:43:30.398 --> 02:43:33.119]  Research all the things it does for your body.
[02:43:33.119 --> 02:43:34.840]  That is about to end.
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:37.201]  Unlock the ancient power of bone broth.
[02:43:37.201 --> 02:43:37.901]  50% off.
[02:43:37.901 --> 02:43:39.622]  That's very close to selling out.
[02:43:39.622 --> 02:43:43.063]  MycoZX that goes up with the candida yeast to mold the gut.
[02:43:43.063 --> 02:43:43.323]  That's
[02:43:43.983 --> 02:43:46.046]  50% off, free shipping, double Patriot points.
[02:43:46.046 --> 02:43:47.868]  All this is free shipping, double Patriot points.
[02:43:47.868 --> 02:43:49.189]  That's about to end.
[02:43:49.189 --> 02:43:51.792]  Living Defense that everybody loves so much.
[02:43:51.792 --> 02:43:52.813]  That's 50% off.
[02:43:52.813 --> 02:43:55.015]  That's about to end.
[02:43:55.015 --> 02:43:56.637]  It is a huge sale.
[02:43:56.637 --> 02:44:00.221]  Infowarsstore.com and your purchases from the InfoWars.
[02:44:00.221 --> 02:44:03.565]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:44:04.105 --> 02:44:08.570]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds, and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[02:44:08.570 --> 02:44:10.492]  I don't care what your views are.
[02:44:10.492 --> 02:44:13.515]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[02:44:13.515 --> 02:44:14.295]  That's important.
[02:44:14.295 --> 02:44:15.897]  But we have something in common.
[02:44:15.897 --> 02:44:19.501]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[02:44:19.981 --> 02:44:27.185]  Clinton deep state bag man Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to Congress and the world.
[02:44:27.185 --> 02:44:32.928]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident, he won't get indicted.
[02:44:32.928 --> 02:44:37.370]  Word is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[02:44:37.370 --> 02:44:39.131]  From my new home in New Zealand, I will...
[02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:45.631]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[02:44:45.631 --> 02:44:47.531]  Not so fast, criminal!
[02:44:47.531 --> 02:44:51.432]  We're going to bring you to justice, and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[02:44:51.432 --> 02:44:56.254]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[02:44:56.254 --> 02:45:05.776]  But the American people know how much you hate us, and we're fighting back at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Banned.Video!
[02:45:05.776 --> 02:45:08.737]  The time has come to defy the Thought Police.
[02:45:09.929 --> 02:45:13.435]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[02:45:13.435 --> 02:45:22.390]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[02:45:23.726 --> 02:45:26.710]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[02:45:26.710 --> 02:45:33.157]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[02:45:33.157 --> 02:45:40.226]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[02:45:40.226 --> 02:45:42.769]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[02:45:43.389 --> 02:45:47.651]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[02:45:47.651 --> 02:45:51.553]  We have a It's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap.
[02:45:51.553 --> 02:45:52.414]  It's black and white.
[02:45:52.414 --> 02:45:52.874]  Very nice.
[02:45:52.874 --> 02:45:54.395]  It has the OK symbol on it.
[02:45:54.395 --> 02:45:56.216]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[02:45:56.216 --> 02:45:58.217]  Infowars.com is on the back.
[02:45:58.217 --> 02:46:04.180]  Get yours today at InfowarsStore.com and support free speech by supporting Infowars while having a great hat.
[02:46:06.189 --> 02:46:07.229]  Here's the bad news.
[02:46:07.229 --> 02:46:11.811]  Ultra 12 is selling out at 50% off double Patriot points free shipping.
[02:46:11.811 --> 02:46:13.091]  So is Vazzo Beach.
[02:46:13.091 --> 02:46:15.092]  So is Ultimate Bone Broth.
[02:46:15.092 --> 02:46:16.472]  So is Mico ZX.
[02:46:16.472 --> 02:46:17.353]  So is Living Defense.

[02:46:47.420 --> 02:46:48.361]  So please take action.

[02:46:53.643 --> 02:46:54.884]  InfowarStore.com.
[02:46:54.884 --> 02:46:57.265]  Back in stock, Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:46:57.265 --> 02:46:58.446]  It's so good for you.
[02:46:58.446 --> 02:46:59.967]  And it funds the Infowar.
[02:46:59.967 --> 02:47:01.328]  A total 360 win.
[02:47:01.328 --> 02:47:08.012]  InfowarStore.com.
[02:47:08.012 --> 02:47:10.673]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:44.690]  I'm going to continue with your phone calls, and then, before Nick Begich takes over, video Canadian Health Minister accused of faking flu shot while pushing vaccines.
[02:47:44.690 --> 02:47:54.818]  And we've got other cases of people faking the flu shots on national TV, and the German government getting special, quote, untainted vaccines for government officials.
[02:47:54.818 --> 02:47:55.699]  Hmm.
[02:47:55.699 --> 02:47:56.840]  Oh, but there's no problem.
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:47:57.280]  Take this.
[02:47:58.334 --> 02:48:08.758]  Also, they've now got billboards in London, drugreport.com is linked to this, telling white people not to have children and to get sterilized.
[02:48:08.758 --> 02:48:13.100]  Very important articles to get out to everyone you know.
[02:48:13.100 --> 02:48:23.425]  But this country is in a constitutional crisis, and if the Democrats try to illegally remove Trump, including with a sham, improperly executed, violating the Constitution, impeachment,
[02:48:24.116 --> 02:48:25.017]  They control the House.
[02:48:25.017 --> 02:48:26.738]  They do it by fraud.
[02:48:26.738 --> 02:48:33.364]  Then we're in a military crisis, as Congressman Gohmert and others have said, a shooting war.
[02:48:33.364 --> 02:48:39.188]  This cold Civil War is becoming very warm and going towards the latter stage.
[02:48:39.188 --> 02:48:43.932]  That's the big takeaway on this Friday transmission.
[02:48:43.932 --> 02:48:46.594]  Obviously, we're going to be covering Hillary coming to town Sunday.
[02:48:46.594 --> 02:48:47.875]  I'll also be on air here.
[02:48:47.875 --> 02:48:49.036]  There's going to be a lot going on.
[02:48:49.036 --> 02:48:50.718]  Look for special Saturday transmissions.
[02:48:50.718 --> 02:48:51.739]  This is all too important.
[02:48:52.861 --> 02:49:02.626]  And InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and Band.Video are the place that will have the resistance and the truth, the talking points that challenge the globalist lies.
[02:49:02.626 --> 02:49:04.927]  You know all about the New World Order.
[02:49:04.927 --> 02:49:11.090]  I know I'm stating something simple here, but you are the only way, the bridge to others for our local radio stations or TV stations.
[02:49:11.090 --> 02:49:12.011]  Tell people about them.
[02:49:12.011 --> 02:49:16.213]  Or about Band.Video or InfoWars.com, where you find all the feeds and all the other great programs.
[02:49:19.619 --> 02:49:21.260]  Let's race through your calls.
[02:49:21.260 --> 02:49:23.062]  Who's been holding longest here?
[02:49:23.062 --> 02:49:25.483]  It's Jess in Canada, then we'll go to others.
[02:49:25.483 --> 02:49:29.166]  Jess, thanks for calling.
[02:49:29.166 --> 02:49:30.927]  Hi, it's Jeff in Canada, Alex.
[02:49:30.927 --> 02:49:31.508]  Jeff, thank you.
[02:49:31.508 --> 02:49:32.689]  Sorry I had Jess on the screen.
[02:49:32.689 --> 02:49:33.810]  Go ahead.
[02:49:33.810 --> 02:49:39.394]  Okay, I called in yesterday and I just want to put a part two to this.
[02:49:39.394 --> 02:49:41.175]  Everybody's asking, what can we do?
[02:49:41.175 --> 02:49:43.697]  And I want to say this again, reiterate this.
[02:49:43.697 --> 02:49:46.379]  Operation Patriot Revere Worldwide.
[02:49:46.823 --> 02:49:51.627]  The facts are that Donald Trump, you, Michael Savage and the like are the generals.
[02:49:51.627 --> 02:49:58.352]  But every good leader and general knows that without an army, it's impossible to win the war.
[02:49:58.352 --> 02:50:03.036]  So what I would like to see is the release of the army.
[02:50:03.036 --> 02:50:04.657]  I believe it's beyond Infowars.
[02:50:04.657 --> 02:50:06.118]  I beg you to do this, Alex.
[02:50:06.118 --> 02:50:07.059]  I beg you to do this.
[02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:18.308]  In an analogy, in the Moravian Revivals back in the day, 25% of the people were missionaries, 75% of the people funded the ministry of those missionaries.
[02:50:18.308 --> 02:50:32.379]  And in that same spirit, what I would like to see is Operation Patriot Revere worldwide with hats and shirts to galvanize the army together and
[02:50:34.449 --> 02:50:41.833]  Make videos and creative ideas to influence the war right now in the First Amendment phase.
[02:50:41.833 --> 02:50:42.313]  Sir, I hear you.
[02:50:42.313 --> 02:50:42.954]  I gotta jump.
[02:50:42.954 --> 02:50:43.914]  Yes, I appreciate your call.
[02:50:43.914 --> 02:50:46.376]  We're moving quick here.
[02:50:46.376 --> 02:50:48.877]  We want children for prison.
[02:50:48.877 --> 02:50:51.518]  With people like little Paul Revere pens or something.
[02:50:51.518 --> 02:50:53.840]  People send us data, they send it to Project Veritas.
[02:50:53.840 --> 02:50:54.280]  We're fighting.
[02:50:55.828 --> 02:50:57.869]  We're so late in the game here.
[02:50:57.869 --> 02:50:59.390]  We need intelligence on the ground.
[02:50:59.390 --> 02:51:01.311]  You go to any leftist event.
[02:51:01.311 --> 02:51:02.911]  Infiltrate Antifa.
[02:51:02.911 --> 02:51:04.352]  You go show what they're doing.
[02:51:04.352 --> 02:51:05.232]  Then get it out on the internet.
[02:51:05.232 --> 02:51:06.173]  Send it to us.
[02:51:06.173 --> 02:51:08.794]  Action at InfoWars.com.
[02:51:08.794 --> 02:51:09.955]  Go into Hillary's speeches.
[02:51:09.955 --> 02:51:11.956]  She's all over the country, running for president.
[02:51:11.956 --> 02:51:13.396]  Just hasn't announced it yet.
[02:51:13.396 --> 02:51:14.397]  Go confront her.
[02:51:14.397 --> 02:51:18.159]  You don't represent women, you monster.
[02:51:18.159 --> 02:51:19.819]  How dare you be behind the impeachment?
[02:51:19.819 --> 02:51:21.020]  She's running it all!
[02:51:22.346 --> 02:51:24.948]  People are like, oh no, she's done, it's over Alex.
[02:51:24.948 --> 02:51:25.969]  No!
[02:51:25.969 --> 02:51:28.972]  I told you they'd pass the initiation of impeachment in the House.
[02:51:28.972 --> 02:51:31.194]  They did, yesterday.
[02:51:31.194 --> 02:51:33.016]  They mean business.
[02:51:33.016 --> 02:51:35.558]  They're a bunch of self-confident criminals.
[02:51:35.558 --> 02:51:39.822]  You watch Brennan and others on TV going, we're the deep state, thank God for us.
[02:51:39.822 --> 02:51:44.306]  Our intelligence agencies guard America and we're getting rid of Trump.
[02:51:44.306 --> 02:51:45.767]  They're rogue criminals.
[02:51:46.667 --> 02:51:50.310]  Openly pissing in our face so that all their minions think they're still in charge.
[02:51:50.310 --> 02:51:54.193]  It's all a confidence act.
[02:51:54.193 --> 02:51:56.535]  Chris in Virginia, thanks for holding it on the air worldwide.
[02:51:56.535 --> 02:52:01.780]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:01.780 --> 02:52:04.242]  Yeah, I was just calling in about bagpipes of war.
[02:52:04.242 --> 02:52:10.067]  A lot of people forgot about when William Barr was in the DOJ and he was blowing in bagpipes.
[02:52:10.067 --> 02:52:14.951]  A lot of people got a kick out of it, but I think he was signaling to the deep state that it was wartime.
[02:52:15.706 --> 02:52:25.851]  And after that, the Mueller hearing was over, Trump had a press conference where he was saying, look into Ukraine, look into Australia, look into all these different places.
[02:52:25.851 --> 02:52:27.172]  Nobody said a word about that.
[02:52:27.172 --> 02:52:31.594]  Now everybody wants to impeach him because of Ukraine.
[02:52:31.594 --> 02:52:40.159]  So what I think is going on is that behind the scenes, and I think this is where Trump is different from maybe JFK, I think he has the support of the military.
[02:52:40.888 --> 02:52:43.772]  The word commanders on the ground, he's empowered them.
[02:52:43.772 --> 02:52:49.019]  Where he took the power out of the Pentagon and gave it, put it to the people that's on the ground.
[02:52:49.019 --> 02:52:51.181]  That way they have a direct line to the President.
[02:52:51.181 --> 02:52:53.344]  So they can go do all these special missions.
[02:52:53.344 --> 02:52:54.225]  Chris, don't hang up.
[02:52:54.225 --> 02:52:55.887]  I want to back up what you're saying from Virginia.
[02:52:56.778 --> 02:52:59.861]  I talked to folks that were there the day he got inaugurated.
[02:52:59.861 --> 02:53:07.067]  He went to the CIA and had over 200 of the top actual people that do the work on the ground in charge of those.
[02:53:07.067 --> 02:53:10.210]  And he just said, you're now in command.
[02:53:10.210 --> 02:53:12.813]  Whatever you think, I have confidence in you.
[02:53:12.813 --> 02:53:13.713]  Execute the missions.
[02:53:14.694 --> 02:53:16.935]  And that absolutely pissed off the deep state.
[02:53:16.935 --> 02:53:19.777]  That's why they tried to sabotage a few of the early missions.
[02:53:19.777 --> 02:53:24.840]  And then Trump started just completely cutting all the deep staters out of the decision-making process.
[02:53:24.840 --> 02:53:26.221]  So what you're saying is absolutely true.
[02:53:26.221 --> 02:53:28.102]  Please continue.
[02:53:28.102 --> 02:53:33.805]  I think also that he's also empowered William Barr and Durham.
[02:53:33.805 --> 02:53:35.686]  They're really afraid of Durham.
[02:53:35.686 --> 02:53:37.827]  They wasn't worried about the horror rates.
[02:53:38.103 --> 02:53:41.345]  But they're worried about Durham because they know his investigation is real.
[02:53:41.345 --> 02:53:44.367]  You know, justice, it takes time to come.
[02:53:44.367 --> 02:53:45.847]  You know, a lot of people are impatient.
[02:53:45.847 --> 02:53:46.828]  They want justice to come.
[02:53:46.828 --> 02:53:51.571]  But I think you have to go after these super criminals for the rest of the following line.
[02:53:51.571 --> 02:53:57.214]  If you want to get big tech in order, if you want to get everything, everybody else in order, you have to take out the big fish.
[02:53:57.214 --> 02:53:58.234]  And these are high rollers.
[02:53:58.234 --> 02:53:59.795]  So it's not going to be easy.
[02:53:59.795 --> 02:54:06.319]  But I think with the power of the military and the power of the people getting the word out, I think people are more awake now than ever.
[02:54:06.920 --> 02:54:10.901]  And I think that their time is numbered.
[02:54:10.901 --> 02:54:12.461]  We've got a lot of really good calls today.
[02:54:12.461 --> 02:54:14.622]  We've got to get this fella's number.
[02:54:14.622 --> 02:54:16.442]  Chris, if you want to be part of this show, we're going to launch.
[02:54:16.442 --> 02:54:18.383]  We don't have to do it every week or even every month.
[02:54:18.383 --> 02:54:25.565]  We want to get like 30 names of people that want to come in, do the show a while, and then start hosting it because you've got a great voice and you're making really great points.
[02:54:25.565 --> 02:54:28.886]  And so I'm dedicated by next week to really start that show every week.
[02:54:28.886 --> 02:54:31.406]  I'm not going to host it every week myself because I'm already working seven days a week.
[02:54:31.406 --> 02:54:33.167]  But Chris, I'd love to have you involved in that.
[02:54:33.167 --> 02:54:33.787]  Let me ask you this.
[02:54:35.478 --> 02:54:37.099]  How long can Trump wait, though?
[02:54:37.099 --> 02:54:39.101]  Because it's totally out of control.
[02:54:39.101 --> 02:54:40.842]  They're having secret hearings.
[02:54:40.842 --> 02:54:42.303]  They're running around threatening everybody.
[02:54:42.303 --> 02:54:44.384]  They're trying to sabotage the economy.
[02:54:44.384 --> 02:54:45.845]  I mean, how long?
[02:54:45.845 --> 02:54:49.788]  Because now Trump says he's going to start the fireside chats.
[02:54:49.788 --> 02:54:57.914]  I think he needs serious national addresses about these criminals and go right to the people, more than just Twitter.
[02:54:57.914 --> 02:55:04.599]  He needs to say on TV from the White House desk what he says on Twitter.
[02:55:04.599 --> 02:55:05.059]  What do you say?
[02:55:06.761 --> 02:55:07.161]  I said that.
[02:55:07.161 --> 02:55:20.232]  That is a good idea, but I also think that, you know, in this game that he's playing, I think he's playing this game that the Democrats are playing way better than they're playing, and the deep state that he's playing right now.
[02:55:20.232 --> 02:55:26.937]  I think that, you know, he's done a good job of getting the word out there, but I think there's only so much that he can do.
[02:55:26.937 --> 02:55:32.281]  He just did an interview where he said that he had a lot of cards to play with the declassification.
[02:55:32.281 --> 02:55:33.602]  They asked him why was he holding it.
[02:55:34.930 --> 02:55:39.934]  Uh, he wouldn't, he didn't want to play that card right then because he knew that it would be gone by now.
[02:55:39.934 --> 02:55:41.235]  It'd be tomorrow's news.
[02:55:41.235 --> 02:55:50.223]  So I think that he's waiting for 2020 to have the Democrats on defense all year leading up to the election with declassification, indictments,
[02:55:50.703 --> 02:55:55.887]  So much stuff that I think the system, as we know it, is about to crumble.
[02:55:55.887 --> 02:55:56.847]  Oh, I agree.
[02:55:56.847 --> 02:55:59.209]  Listen, what you said up front is the key.
[02:55:59.209 --> 02:56:00.550]  They are scared.
[02:56:00.550 --> 02:56:04.132]  They are running around crazy doing criminal things.
[02:56:04.132 --> 02:56:07.574]  I just don't like letting them run wild like this.
[02:56:07.574 --> 02:56:08.375]  It's so illegal.
[02:56:08.375 --> 02:56:10.376]  It's emboldening their minions.
[02:56:10.376 --> 02:56:12.537]  And I understand the strategies of wait, wait, wait.
[02:56:15.168 --> 02:56:17.510]  You wait too long, you burn the cake.
[02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:20.032]  I think it's time to get the cake out of the oven.
[02:56:20.032 --> 02:56:22.614]  I mean, we're into 2020, basically.
[02:56:22.614 --> 02:56:28.598]  We're a year out from the election in just, what, four or five days, my friend?
[02:56:28.598 --> 02:56:33.342]  Yeah, we're in a situation right now that we need to get
[02:56:34.086 --> 02:56:35.907]  It is urgency.
[02:56:35.907 --> 02:56:38.248]  Urgency isn't necessary at this time.
[02:56:38.248 --> 02:56:43.251]  But I think for us on the ground as people, we just got to continue the information war.
[02:56:43.251 --> 02:56:50.355]  For the people inside the government, I think that they have to get mobilized and grow a pair and really get behind this president.
[02:56:50.355 --> 02:56:59.620]  Because like you say, there's a lot of good patriots in this government, but they have to be the ones to step up from the inside so it makes it better for us on the outside.
[02:57:01.343 --> 02:57:02.365]  Absolutely.
[02:57:02.365 --> 02:57:05.328]  You can feel the energy, you can see it, and it's happening all over the world.
[02:57:05.328 --> 02:57:07.511]  People are overthrowing these globalist governments.
[02:57:07.511 --> 02:57:11.116]  People know the truth, and it's only a matter of time.
[02:57:12.657 --> 02:57:18.121]  Hillary really thinks they're going to remove Trump and that she's going to skate in against whatever Republican they put in against her.
[02:57:18.121 --> 02:57:19.923]  And I just don't see that working.
[02:57:19.923 --> 02:57:24.206]  Even if they're able to kill Trump, it triggers something that destroys them.
[02:57:24.206 --> 02:57:26.488]  But they just are too stupid to get it.
[02:57:26.488 --> 02:57:31.071]  And they'll have to have the deep state out in the open admitting that they exist and they're going to stop Trump.
[02:57:31.071 --> 02:57:35.435]  Even if they get rid of Trump, they're going to be removed by another group that's going to use their weakness.
[02:57:35.435 --> 02:57:38.958]  And they're just so stupid what they've done.
[02:57:38.958 --> 02:57:40.038]  God bless you, Chris.
[02:57:40.038 --> 02:57:40.639]  Really good points.
[02:57:42.526 --> 02:57:43.547]  Fourth hour's about to start.
[02:57:43.547 --> 02:57:51.053]  I'm going to get to Matt, Danny, Chris, and Jeff, so another Chris, and then we're going to catch some other news.
[02:57:51.053 --> 02:57:52.314]  The Dr. Nick Baggage is coming up.
[02:57:52.314 --> 02:57:53.995]  Please stay with us.
[02:57:53.995 --> 02:57:55.596]  Alex Jones.
[02:57:55.596 --> 02:57:57.898]  Stop the iodine conspiracy.
[02:57:57.898 --> 02:57:59.579]  Wake up the world challenge.

[02:58:09.867 --> 02:58:15.772]  Ladies and gentlemen, X2 and X3 are two amazing formulas of iodine.

[02:58:17.433 --> 02:58:19.434]  See which one works best for you.
[02:58:19.434 --> 02:58:23.717]  Bio-True Selenium from the mustard seed supercharges all of it.
[02:58:23.717 --> 02:58:26.700]  We have this best deal ever on these products.

[02:58:30.783 --> 02:58:33.705]  But we're about to have to end this special.
[02:58:33.925 --> 02:58:38.891]  The Everything Must Go Super sale is the main sale, and this sale is part of that sale.
[02:58:38.891 --> 02:58:41.574]  It's going to have to end by early next week.

[02:58:55.754 --> 02:58:57.917]  All of our bodies are different.
[02:58:57.917 --> 02:59:00.720]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[02:59:00.720 --> 02:59:03.723]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[02:59:03.723 --> 02:59:08.529]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something you don't know.
[02:59:08.529 --> 02:59:10.491]  But I'm here to tell you.
[02:59:10.491 --> 02:59:12.814]  Every time I commit and use
[02:59:13.935 --> 02:59:17.876]  The supplements that we sell on a religious basis.
[02:59:17.876 --> 02:59:19.657]  My life completely changes.
[02:59:19.657 --> 02:59:20.317]  I'm healthier.
[02:59:20.317 --> 02:59:21.657]  I have more energy.
[02:59:21.657 --> 02:59:22.477]  I lose weight.
[02:59:22.477 --> 02:59:23.258]  I look better.
[02:59:23.258 --> 02:59:24.818]  Everybody notices.
[02:59:24.818 --> 02:59:31.340]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2 Body's Ultimate Turmeric.
[02:59:32.120 --> 02:59:37.184]  I'm gonna commit to flush my gut out with the Gut Fusion from InfoWars Life.

[02:59:53.776 --> 02:59:58.039]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:58.039 --> 03:00:00.681]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:30.842 --> 03:00:31.422]  Alex Jones, sir!
[03:00:58.112 --> 03:01:00.494]  It's an honor to talk to you, finally.
[03:01:00.494 --> 03:01:04.016]  I was actually on the ground in D.C.
[03:01:04.016 --> 03:01:11.881]  during the inauguration, looking for you, hunting for you, wearing my Hillary Joker shirt.
[03:01:11.881 --> 03:01:13.181]  You probably heard me.
[03:01:13.181 --> 03:01:16.243]  I had tickets in the blue section and the silver section.
[03:01:16.243 --> 03:01:25.289]  I was the only one when Obama and Hillary got on stage, booing as loud as I can.
[03:01:26.036 --> 03:01:53.845]  I'm familiar with booing really loud because I'm a Chicago White Sox fan and I spent, grew up at the park there and I just moved from, I want to be concise with what I talk about right now, I just moved from the most beautiful area in the country in Evergreen, Colorado and now I moved back here to the Chicagoland for money but
[03:01:56.055 --> 03:02:00.878]  Being, I got woke up to you so long ago.
[03:02:00.878 --> 03:02:09.002]  I think it was around 2002, whenever you came out with, it's called Martial Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[03:02:09.002 --> 03:02:09.382]  Yes.
[03:02:09.382 --> 03:02:13.344]  My brother woke me up in a dead sleep, shaking me.
[03:02:13.344 --> 03:02:13.944]  Wake up!
[03:02:13.944 --> 03:02:14.445]  Wake up!
[03:02:14.445 --> 03:02:16.946]  You gotta come see this!
[03:02:16.946 --> 03:02:18.147]  Drugged me upstairs.
[03:02:18.147 --> 03:02:21.468]  It was public access TV.
[03:02:21.468 --> 03:02:24.490]  And since that moment, I've been on this road.
[03:02:25.948 --> 03:02:31.192]  And I've gotten to shake hands with Dr. Ron Paul, Rand Paul.
[03:02:31.192 --> 03:02:35.116]  I worked security for Trump Jr.
[03:02:35.116 --> 03:02:41.801]  in Colorado, where it was literally me, Secret Service sheriffs, and Trump Jr.
[03:02:41.801 --> 03:02:43.262]  And Eric Trump.
[03:02:43.262 --> 03:02:46.285]  I went to all the rallies.
[03:02:46.285 --> 03:02:53.591]  And, uh, the point that I called in about is just kind of a side issue, to be honest.
[03:02:54.781 --> 03:02:59.845]  I love listening because your phone sounds good and clear.
[03:02:59.845 --> 03:03:01.026]  And you're making good points.
[03:03:01.026 --> 03:03:02.948]  I like hearing about the listeners.
[03:03:02.948 --> 03:03:09.753]  This is the only time that I would put my personal surveillance device next to my head to talk to you, sir.
[03:03:09.753 --> 03:03:11.755]  Well, we're honored to have you here.
[03:03:11.755 --> 03:03:13.256]  So what do you think Trump needs to do?
[03:03:13.256 --> 03:03:16.379]  Because the urgency is just fever pitch right now.
[03:03:16.379 --> 03:03:18.200]  I know what Trump needs to do.
[03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:22.844]  And actually, believe it or not, I have a referendum.
[03:03:23.632 --> 03:03:27.594]  that has been approved in the state of Colorado.
[03:03:27.594 --> 03:03:32.236]  I went to hearings at the Secretary of State and the Capitol building.
[03:03:32.236 --> 03:03:33.957]  I got grilled by their lawyers.
[03:03:33.957 --> 03:03:37.338]  So tell me about that and then tell me about your Beto coded message.
[03:03:37.338 --> 03:03:38.279]  Okay.
[03:03:38.279 --> 03:03:50.405]  So Beto, during, I think it was on world four, I believe, uh, he's when he is there debating booty judge about guns.
[03:03:50.405 --> 03:03:50.965]  He says,
[03:03:53.837 --> 03:04:01.544]  Anyone brandishing weapons will be... Okay, so this is a direct shot at Caitlyn Bennett.
[03:04:01.544 --> 03:04:10.492]  He says that anyone that's brandishing their weapons for intimidation like they did in Kent State will be red flagged.
[03:04:11.781 --> 03:04:15.302]  I don't remember any violence ever happening yet.
[03:04:15.302 --> 03:04:15.883]  No, that's right.
[03:04:15.883 --> 03:04:20.384]  He's saying if you have a firearm and someone doesn't like you having it, it'll be taken.
[03:04:20.384 --> 03:04:21.005]  You're right.
[03:04:21.005 --> 03:04:26.367]  I remember when I saw that, I knew it was Caitlyn Bennett and then I just forgot about it because so much happened.
[03:04:26.367 --> 03:04:27.547]  I'm going to get her on about that.
[03:04:27.547 --> 03:04:28.027]  Great point.
[03:04:28.027 --> 03:04:29.428]  God bless you.
[03:04:29.428 --> 03:04:30.328]  I know Mac is gone for an hour.
[03:04:30.328 --> 03:04:31.068]  I listened to him for an hour.
[03:04:33.109 --> 03:04:33.890]  I need to get better.
[03:04:33.890 --> 03:04:35.911]  I've gotten a little better at getting calls.
[03:04:35.911 --> 03:04:42.055]  For years, I haven't really been taking a lot of calls, but I'm getting back to it because it really brings in a lot of wild cards, a lot of good angles.
[03:04:42.055 --> 03:04:43.336]  And we've done pretty good, O'Day.
[03:04:43.336 --> 03:04:47.900]  I'd give myself about a C-minus, but it's better than an F-minus I usually get.
[03:04:47.900 --> 03:04:51.682]  We're talking to Danny and Jeff, and then I'm going to hit a bunch of news, and then Dr. Nick Megich is coming up.
[03:04:51.682 --> 03:04:53.003]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[03:04:53.003 --> 03:04:54.504]  Wow!
[03:04:54.504 --> 03:04:56.446]  Man, it's crazy what's going on!
[03:04:56.446 --> 03:04:58.647]  Did you hear what Gohmert said?
[03:04:58.647 --> 03:04:59.868]  The congressman?
[03:04:59.868 --> 03:05:00.649]  About civil war?
[03:05:04.584 --> 03:05:08.268]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[03:05:08.268 --> 03:05:16.257]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[03:05:16.257 --> 03:05:18.839]  It's just that simple.
[03:05:18.839 --> 03:05:25.246]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[03:05:25.246 --> 03:05:25.767]  Others like
[03:05:26.327 --> 03:05:28.429]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[03:05:28.429 --> 03:05:29.149]  Get both.
[03:05:29.149 --> 03:05:30.610]  They're both great for you.
[03:05:30.610 --> 03:05:35.033]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[03:05:35.033 --> 03:05:37.234]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[03:05:37.234 --> 03:05:38.595]  That's why I harp on it.
[03:05:38.595 --> 03:05:42.778]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[03:05:42.778 --> 03:05:44.939]  Lower IQ makes you sluggish.
[03:05:44.939 --> 03:05:46.020]  You don't live as long.
[03:05:46.020 --> 03:05:46.780]  It's simple.

[03:05:56.146 --> 03:05:57.987]  It's the Iodine Challenge.
[03:05:57.987 --> 03:06:01.449]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[03:06:01.449 --> 03:06:05.071]  Another world.
[03:06:05.071 --> 03:06:05.572]  Another time.
[03:06:05.572 --> 03:06:06.932]  In the age of wonder.
[03:06:28.770 --> 03:06:36.075]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:36.075 --> 03:06:46.362]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:46.362 --> 03:06:49.564]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back broadcasting worldwide into the fourth hour.
[03:06:49.564 --> 03:06:51.686]  Dr. Nick Vegas is about to take over in a moment.
[03:06:51.686 --> 03:06:53.027]  I have several video clips I want to play.
[03:06:54.940 --> 03:06:55.300]  Hey Alex.
[03:07:12.244 --> 03:07:25.848]  So I was just wanting to chat with you about the self-proclaimed Antifa member making posts about putting fentanyl and trick-or-treat candy for children, quote, children dressed in some MAGA-type costumes.
[03:07:25.848 --> 03:07:34.851]  This is some disgusting, I'm hoping it was just some trolling type of thing, but the sad thing is that, you know, nobody
[03:07:35.751 --> 03:07:54.122]  Seems to take these things seriously, and that is a very serious thing to say, especially when earlier, uh, was it yesterday or this week, uh, they found, you know, busted 40 pounds of, uh, fentanyl in Ohio, enough to kill the entire state more than once.
[03:07:54.122 --> 03:08:02.967]  Uh, and they caught, uh, TACOM trying to ship through Mexico, enough to kill the whole world, 10 billion, 600 plus million people once, and you're absolutely right, and I,
[03:08:03.507 --> 03:08:06.690]  I know a lot of people who've had friends and family die from fentanyl.
[03:08:06.690 --> 03:08:14.497]  I know a fella whose girlfriend died when they gave her a supposedly marijuana vape that was laced with fentanyl.
[03:08:14.497 --> 03:08:16.879]  And so, yes, China is bombarding us.
[03:08:16.879 --> 03:08:18.460]  Others are bombarding us.
[03:08:18.460 --> 03:08:19.961]  And that article's on Infowars.com.
[03:08:19.961 --> 03:08:22.503]  It's pretty sick, isn't it?
[03:08:22.503 --> 03:08:23.264]  It's disgusting.
[03:08:23.264 --> 03:08:29.890]  I noticed that they took his page down earlier this morning on Twitter, but I've been going through it on the Wayback Machine.
[03:08:30.643 --> 03:08:34.225]  I mean, this guy's just scum, you know, piece of garbage.
[03:08:34.225 --> 03:08:39.447]  Some Antifa... By the way, just because somebody's dressed like Trump doesn't mean they're a Trump supporter.
[03:08:39.447 --> 03:08:53.073]  Most of the masks are anti-Trump you see out there, so that shows how dumb they are too, because they will just attack random... I've seen Antifa attack white people just because they're white, thinking they must be racist, and they're a white person doing the attacking.
[03:08:54.915 --> 03:08:55.735]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:08:55.735 --> 03:08:58.056]  I mean, you know, we're talking about the Civil War.
[03:08:58.056 --> 03:09:12.639]  I mean, if this is China pushing this stuff in, and then Antifa doing things like this, whether they're doing it or not, it's hard to say, but it still has to be taken seriously when they're... Listen, I went to a sushi restaurant six years ago.
[03:09:12.639 --> 03:09:21.501]  I remember I was in the middle of my divorce, and I just went out with a friend, and we had walked down there, because I lived downtown at the time, and
[03:09:24.178 --> 03:09:28.761]  By the time I got back to my condo, I was crawling into the bed.
[03:09:28.761 --> 03:09:30.342]  And it happened to my friend as well.
[03:09:30.342 --> 03:09:34.946]  And then later we went back and they're like, well, yeah, somebody behind the counter didn't really like you.
[03:09:34.946 --> 03:09:35.166]  Whatever.
[03:09:35.166 --> 03:09:36.807]  Yeah, I heard that guy does that.
[03:09:36.807 --> 03:09:38.088]  I heard something about it.
[03:09:38.088 --> 03:09:40.149]  These leftists are so nonchalant.
[03:09:40.149 --> 03:09:42.731]  They're like, yeah, we heard you got, you know, your drink.
[03:09:42.731 --> 03:09:43.472]  Could have killed me.
[03:09:44.417 --> 03:09:47.818]  And then, of course, we come back, well, we're not going to say who it was.
[03:09:47.818 --> 03:09:52.300]  How would they like it if I came there and crammed fentanyl down their throat and they died?
[03:09:52.300 --> 03:09:53.020]  Then it'd be a big deal.
[03:09:53.020 --> 03:09:55.000]  But, oh, it's a Trump supporter, so you can do that.
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:56.381]  That was even pre-Trump.
[03:09:56.381 --> 03:09:59.402]  But, yeah, these leftists, man, they're just the scum of the earth.
[03:09:59.402 --> 03:09:59.882]  God bless you.
[03:09:59.882 --> 03:10:01.122]  I appreciate your call, Danny.
[03:10:01.122 --> 03:10:02.903]  Jeff in California.
[03:10:02.903 --> 03:10:08.725]  Man, what is going on out in California with the fires where they won't cut out the dead undergrowth?
[03:10:09.525 --> 03:10:11.585]  They make fun of Trump saying, rake the forest.
[03:10:11.585 --> 03:10:13.606]  Well, that's literally what you do.
[03:10:13.606 --> 03:10:17.467]  What do you make of just all that's going on, my friend?
[03:10:17.467 --> 03:10:19.067]  There's a lot going on, Alex.
[03:10:19.067 --> 03:10:22.667]  And I live in the South Bay area, so I get all the smoke down here.
[03:10:22.667 --> 03:10:23.708]  So yeah, it sucks.
[03:10:23.708 --> 03:10:28.029]  And to hear that it's all about climate change, it has nothing to do with it.
[03:10:28.029 --> 03:10:32.789]  It's so frustrating to hear people that I work and live around saying that crap.
[03:10:32.789 --> 03:10:34.350]  Oh, excuse me.
[03:10:34.350 --> 03:10:35.190]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[03:10:36.719 --> 03:10:45.102]  I did want to say, you know, public acts confronting Hillary and all that's great, but we can also do little things to wake people up.
[03:10:45.102 --> 03:11:02.048]  Just a real quick example, like I said, I'm in the belly of the beast, Bay Area, and when the Epstein story broke, the local and national news, all they were doing was showing pictures of Trump with Epstein and spending multiple segments on that.
[03:11:02.048 --> 03:11:04.049]  And my mom saw that and she was like, oh my God.
[03:11:04.830 --> 03:11:21.735]  But because I watch Infowars, I educated her on the truth, that Trump kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago, that Clinton went to, you know, the pedophile island over 20 times and dumped his Secret Service brigade.
[03:11:21.735 --> 03:11:28.017]  So things like that, just waking people up, we can do, and it's huge.
[03:11:28.017 --> 03:11:32.158]  Other thing I wanted to mention is it's time that we start talking about
[03:11:32.591 --> 03:11:39.797]  with the Constitution already has in it to solve all this, and that's implement a new government.
[03:11:39.797 --> 03:11:41.258]  It's beyond time.
[03:11:41.258 --> 03:11:43.680]  Half of our government are traitors.
[03:11:43.680 --> 03:11:54.268]  I say more than half because you have the Democrats, which of course are gone, but then you also have the elitist right-wing Republicans that are sold out, and they're willing to play
[03:11:54.835 --> 03:11:56.217]  Nice with the globalists.
[03:11:56.217 --> 03:11:58.420]  So, we need to start talking about that.
[03:12:07.568 --> 03:12:07.828]  Thank you.
[03:12:29.605 --> 03:12:30.165]  I did pretty good.
[03:12:30.165 --> 03:12:31.046]  I probably took 20 calls.
[03:12:31.046 --> 03:12:32.667]  I want to thank the crew this week.
[03:12:32.667 --> 03:12:36.489]  I have been on fire on air and on fire off air.
[03:12:36.489 --> 03:12:41.332]  And I'm going to be here tonight on the other shows.
[03:12:41.332 --> 03:12:43.434]  I'm just going to pop into both shows.
[03:12:43.434 --> 03:12:47.676]  Owen Troyer's War Room and the Firepower with Bill Johnson and Tom Pappert.
[03:12:47.676 --> 03:12:50.418]  There's just too much breaking, too much that I know has broken.
[03:12:50.418 --> 03:12:57.463]  I've got to go off air because we've got another great guest host popping in the last few segments of this hour, the next three.
[03:12:58.183 --> 03:13:02.325]  When you get excited about the products, we have plenty of money to fund the operation to do great things.
[03:13:02.325 --> 03:13:02.825]  When you don't...
[03:13:15.771 --> 03:13:19.892]  I spend most of my time trying to scrounge around to find money just to keep the lights on.
[03:13:19.892 --> 03:13:22.733]  So I want to thank you all for spending money with InfoWars.
[03:13:22.733 --> 03:13:35.096]  And I want to just tell you, you need fish oil, you need turmeric, you need colloidal silver, you need a good nootropic like RainForce, or a good clean 10-hour energy, the best you're going to find out there, like TurboForce.
[03:13:35.096 --> 03:13:40.558]  And our great peanut butter and chocolate and vanilla coconut and chocolate,
[03:13:41.647 --> 03:13:42.387]  Approaching bars.
[03:13:42.387 --> 03:13:47.210]  I mean, these are high-end bars that sell at places like Whole Foods for $6, $7 apiece.
[03:13:47.210 --> 03:13:51.212]  We usually sell them at $3 apiece in cases of 12.
[03:13:51.212 --> 03:13:54.413]  Well, these now are even lower than that at 50% off.
[03:13:54.413 --> 03:14:00.976]  Most of the sales have to end by Monday or so, because a lot of these are selling out.
[03:14:00.976 --> 03:14:04.858]  And so, again, Ultra 12 is about to sell out.
[03:14:04.858 --> 03:14:06.799]  Really high-quality vitamin B12 taken out of the tongue.
[03:14:09.139 --> 03:14:14.283]  Some things that have been sold out are back in, like DNA Force Plus is 30% off, but it just came back in.
[03:14:14.283 --> 03:14:16.444]  Torway Free Shipping, Double Pantry Points.
[03:14:16.444 --> 03:14:23.509]  We've sold out of more than half of the Alexa Pure Breeze 4-Stage Ion Cluster Filter.
[03:14:23.509 --> 03:14:26.190]  This is the lowest price ever at cost $147.
[03:14:26.190 --> 03:14:32.715]  And then they paid me a rebate to do it.
[03:14:32.715 --> 03:14:37.458]  Even though they sell tons of these, they're very popular, they order a huge amount each year.
[03:14:37.458 --> 03:14:38.459]  And I have a corporate agreement
[03:14:39.397 --> 03:14:44.780]  That I get any things they're going to sell at cost or lost leader first.
[03:14:44.780 --> 03:14:47.722]  I have first right to get whatever I want.
[03:14:47.722 --> 03:14:52.784]  And I took everything they had, $2,300 or something, and there's less than a thousand of them right now.
[03:14:52.784 --> 03:15:00.709]  And I can tell you, I can tell you that we normally make $50 on these when they're selling them for $250, and that's an amazing deal.
[03:15:02.845 --> 03:15:04.426]  Again, that's two different schools of thought.
[03:15:04.426 --> 03:15:10.150]  You can get the very same units for $400, $500 at some fancy store, and they're making them for $150.
[03:15:10.150 --> 03:15:14.292]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[03:15:14.292 --> 03:15:14.933]  It's just crazy.
[03:15:14.933 --> 03:15:15.753]  Well, they don't do that.
[03:15:15.753 --> 03:15:17.334]  They sell them at $250 is the normal price.
[03:15:17.334 --> 03:15:19.175]  $300 is the normal price.
[03:15:19.175 --> 03:15:21.757]  We always discount some.
[03:15:21.757 --> 03:15:24.178]  Those will sell out, I would guess, by Monday or Tuesday.
[03:15:24.178 --> 03:15:27.360]  So take advantage of those, and the little bit of money we make does fund the operation.
[03:15:27.360 --> 03:15:28.341]  Oh, and it's free shipping.
[03:15:28.341 --> 03:15:29.542]  That's why it's the best deal ever.
[03:15:29.542 --> 03:15:30.022]  It's insane.
[03:15:32.148 --> 03:15:33.689]  Alright, infowarestore.com.

[03:19:03.405 --> 03:19:05.046]  The Alex Jones Show!
[03:19:33.285 --> 03:19:33.785]  I don't think so.
[03:20:06.025 --> 03:20:19.736]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.736 --> 03:20:22.158]  Dr. Nick Baggage is taking over right now.
[03:20:22.158 --> 03:20:24.520]  I promise to hit this, and he's an expert.
[03:20:24.520 --> 03:20:25.842]  I'm going to get his take on it as well.
[03:20:26.866 --> 03:20:29.508]  He's got his own agenda of important news to cover.
[03:20:29.508 --> 03:20:32.590]  There's an article up on Infowars.com by Kellen McBrain.
[03:20:32.590 --> 03:20:34.371]  You want to get out to folks.
[03:20:34.371 --> 03:20:39.154]  Canadian health minister accused of faking flu shot by pushing vaccines.
[03:20:39.154 --> 03:20:48.800]  Christina Elliott, Ontario Canada's health minister, was allegedly caught on camera pretending to receive a flu vaccine during a promotional video, urging citizens to get their flu shots.
[03:20:49.460 --> 03:20:57.224]  Now it came out that in China and Germany and Europe, quote, clean vaccines, that's London Guardian, are produced for the elites.
[03:20:57.224 --> 03:20:57.684]  Oh, really?
[03:20:57.684 --> 03:20:59.525]  Clean ones?
[03:20:59.525 --> 03:21:01.246]  It's the liability protection.
[03:21:01.246 --> 03:21:02.067]  It's the danger.
[03:21:02.067 --> 03:21:06.449]  It's the cancer viruses that they've admitted have been in vaccines and all the health problems.
[03:21:06.449 --> 03:21:07.630]  Then they try to deny it.
[03:21:07.630 --> 03:21:15.354]  Zuckerberg got asked a week ago, when he was in Congress, a week and a half ago, why do you ban people who talk about bad effects they personally had?
[03:21:15.354 --> 03:21:17.575]  Isn't it a consumer thing we can talk about?
[03:21:19.175 --> 03:21:24.259]  That's what's happening, ladies and gentlemen, because they want the power to put things in our bodies.
[03:21:24.259 --> 03:21:34.767]  So we'll roll some of the video of that and what happened with her, but first I want to roll this video from the Golden Globes, where the news said Golden Globes participants got shots.
[03:21:34.767 --> 03:21:36.008]  This was a year ago.
[03:21:36.008 --> 03:21:44.374]  Now what was crazy is it was clearly fake nurses with big giant shots, and it wasn't real vaccines.
[03:21:44.374 --> 03:21:46.235]  So that's how dumb they think we are.
[03:21:46.235 --> 03:21:46.756]  Here's the video.
[03:21:48.376 --> 03:21:49.796]  Get a load of this crap.
[03:21:49.796 --> 03:21:57.659]  Normally, at this point of the show, the host would do something fun and spontaneous to show how we're all just ordinary people, like, ordering pizza for everyone.
[03:21:57.659 --> 03:22:01.960]  But since we already get food at the Globes, we thought we'd mix it up and try something new.
[03:22:01.960 --> 03:22:06.381]  So roll up your sleeves, Hollywood, because you're all getting... Blue Shots!
[03:22:10.370 --> 03:22:13.974]  You know you wore a sleeveless gown for a reason!
[03:22:13.974 --> 03:22:14.235]  Hey!
[03:22:14.235 --> 03:22:14.615]  Stop!
[03:22:14.615 --> 03:22:15.036]  Stop!
[03:22:15.036 --> 03:22:15.376]  Stop!
[03:22:15.376 --> 03:22:15.676]  Stop!
[03:22:15.676 --> 03:22:15.937]  Stop!
[03:22:15.937 --> 03:22:16.417]  Stop!
[03:22:16.417 --> 03:22:17.318]  Excuse me, ma'am?
[03:22:17.318 --> 03:22:17.659]  Ma'am?
[03:22:17.659 --> 03:22:20.302]  You're definitely going to want to hit the phone!
[03:22:27.352 --> 03:22:46.517]  So that's what's going on here.
[03:22:46.517 --> 03:22:51.438]  Now here's an 8 second video of her acting like she got it as well and clearly it's a fraud.
[03:22:51.438 --> 03:22:52.759]  The whole thing's a fraud.
[03:22:52.759 --> 03:22:52.999]  Here it is.
[03:22:54.059 --> 03:22:54.339]  No needle!
[03:22:54.339 --> 03:22:55.460]  She's not accused of it.
[03:22:55.460 --> 03:22:56.401]  She clearly staged it.
[03:23:20.422 --> 03:23:20.942]  We love him.
[03:23:20.942 --> 03:23:21.543]  He's awesome.
[03:23:21.543 --> 03:23:26.086]  He's Dr. Nick Baggage, filmmaker, researcher, amazing person, earthpulse.com.
[03:23:26.086 --> 03:23:28.207]  We've got them all saying, kill the president, remove him.
[03:23:28.207 --> 03:23:33.191]  You know, his own dad was a famous congressman that disappeared and was a political, obviously, target.
[03:23:33.191 --> 03:23:35.392]  And then, of course, you've got his brother that was a U.S.
[03:23:35.392 --> 03:23:35.973]  Senator.
[03:23:35.973 --> 03:23:37.594]  Thanks for letting me grab some of your time.
[03:23:37.594 --> 03:23:38.134]  We love you.
[03:23:38.134 --> 03:23:39.195]  We appreciate you.
[03:23:39.195 --> 03:23:40.236]  It's your rodeo, sir.
[03:23:40.236 --> 03:23:41.897]  Thank you.
[03:23:41.897 --> 03:23:44.058]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[03:23:44.058 --> 03:23:45.459]  It's always good to be with you.
[03:23:45.459 --> 03:23:45.840]  You know, the
[03:23:47.401 --> 03:24:01.898]  The whole vaccine thing that you're covering now, you know, one angle that no one ever really talks about, and I've mentioned it on your program before, and it's the idea that, you know, people talk about the right to our own bodies when they talk about
[03:24:02.859 --> 03:24:05.341]  Pro-choice versus the right to life.
[03:24:05.341 --> 03:24:06.701]  And, you know, the U.S.
[03:24:06.701 --> 03:24:08.943]  Supreme Court says your body is your own, right?
[03:24:08.943 --> 03:24:11.344]  Okay, so what about vaccines?
[03:24:11.344 --> 03:24:14.546]  Are our bodies our own or are they not?
[03:24:14.546 --> 03:24:17.448]  So maybe you can have it both ways, I guess.
[03:24:17.448 --> 03:24:21.370]  I'm a pro-life person, just to be clear on that, too, as I'm talking about this.
[03:24:21.370 --> 03:24:23.031]  But my point is,
[03:24:24.835 --> 03:24:31.363]  You know, when you think about our personal health and what is acceptable to us, that's an individual choice on every level.
[03:24:31.363 --> 03:24:40.094]  And, you know, you think about national health coverage and the angle that not many are talking about this either in the context of personal privacy.
[03:24:40.094 --> 03:24:43.639]  And that is a dimension that we really need to think about because
[03:24:44.571 --> 03:24:49.414]  You know, think about all of the different ways that personal privacy gets violated.
[03:24:49.414 --> 03:24:56.219]  I mean, today's news, I heard Google is going to buy Fitbit for a couple billion dollars.
[03:24:56.219 --> 03:25:05.065]  Now, then it mentions sort of the afterthought, you know, like the afterthought you always hear, you know, no, they might have some privacy implications.
[03:25:06.158 --> 03:25:08.301]  Well, actually, it does.
[03:25:08.301 --> 03:25:08.781]  There it is.
[03:25:08.781 --> 03:25:10.303]  Two point one billion dollars.
[03:25:10.303 --> 03:25:11.325]  Smart watchmaker.
[03:25:11.325 --> 03:25:18.293]  Now, what people don't realize is now think about all your Google information now mixed in with your health information.
[03:25:18.293 --> 03:25:24.982]  So the ads you're going to get are about, you know, the drugs for your heart or ads for the gym or whatever.
[03:25:25.402 --> 03:25:46.771]  But the point is, it's an additional layer of data collection by one central company, again, Google, which should be viewed as a utility, that actually now is a collector of more data, which it manipulates and uses commercially and politically, not for your benefit, but for the benefit of commercial and governmental interests.
[03:25:46.771 --> 03:25:49.392]  And that's just the way the system evolved.
[03:25:49.392 --> 03:25:50.973]  I mean, there's no question about it.
[03:25:50.973 --> 03:25:51.953]  The only question
[03:25:52.797 --> 03:26:13.532]  Is it a public utility that should be regulated with open access so this network and others with contrarian voices can still be heard and rated and ranked the same way as anyone else and treated equally as anyone else as a voice out of the wilderness, you ought to have an equal opportunity to be that voice.
[03:26:13.532 --> 03:26:16.775]  And I think that's what we're missing in the 21st century.
[03:26:16.775 --> 03:26:19.316]  And I heard the earlier dialogue about
[03:26:20.869 --> 03:26:23.930]  The fireside chats being discussed.
[03:26:23.930 --> 03:26:26.851]  And you know, it's funny, and I heard both sides of that.
[03:26:26.851 --> 03:26:28.632]  You know, some people say, no, that's a bad idea.
[03:26:28.632 --> 03:26:30.373]  Some say that's a good idea.
[03:26:30.373 --> 03:26:37.015]  I wrote a paper about this that I transferred through a friend of mine up to the Trump administration over a year and a half ago.
[03:26:37.015 --> 03:26:45.619]  And I still believe it's a good idea for the president to control his own microphone for an hour a week or a half an hour a week instead of these Twitter
[03:26:46.471 --> 03:26:54.494]  Deals, you know, give us some real information that's not, you know, the soundbite you're going to see on CNN or Fox or anyone else.
[03:26:54.494 --> 03:26:59.475]  Now, yeah, I know his style is not a Roosevelt and he's not a Roosevelt.
[03:26:59.475 --> 03:27:00.396]  I'd agree with that too.
[03:27:00.396 --> 03:27:08.698]  He's a Donald Trump and he should be Donald Trump, but do it for an hour each week and kind of recap what happened the last week.
[03:27:08.698 --> 03:27:13.440]  Talk about where we're headed the next week and what we can do as American citizens to support
[03:27:14.216 --> 03:27:17.957]  To support it or not, you know, but at least we have a fighting chance.
[03:27:17.957 --> 03:27:24.899]  Get the agenda complete, not the soundbite version, and then, you know, we can decide as a public, right, where we want to be.
[03:27:24.899 --> 03:27:34.582]  But an hour of content from the President, or even a half an hour once a week or every couple weeks, would be welcomed to talk about where we're going and where we've been.
[03:27:34.582 --> 03:27:42.644]  And keep us apprised from his point of view and let us evaluate as the American public what's right, what's wrong, what's good, what's bad, because we're going to do it anyway.
[03:27:44.406 --> 03:27:51.330]  But at least we hear his voice maybe break through the cloud of media control.
[03:27:51.330 --> 03:28:01.395]  And really, I want to kind of talk about all that in this segment in terms of the high road and a way through the matrix as I see it today.
[03:28:01.395 --> 03:28:07.718]  You know, in this program, it's one of the few bright spots where we can talk freely, at least at the moment.
[03:28:08.098 --> 03:28:09.099]  We're good.
[03:28:20.754 --> 03:28:26.779]  Troyer, and we've got everybody, you know, you got all the people, David Knight, the rest, doing the daily news.
[03:28:26.779 --> 03:28:36.746]  And so I try to cover a little bit different angle on the things we're all concerned about from the bigger picture of maybe a human perspective.
[03:28:36.746 --> 03:28:37.866]  How do we engage this?
[03:28:37.866 --> 03:28:46.933]  How do we enliven the public debate in a respectful way that leads us to a set of solutions that we can live with, that we can endorse, that we can support?
[03:28:47.473 --> 03:28:51.015]  And this network, InfoWars, is one of the ways we do it.
[03:28:51.015 --> 03:28:56.957]  So pay attention, look at the InfoWars store, and you can support me too.
[03:28:56.957 --> 03:29:00.319]  Books are there, videos are there, I'd rather you get them from InfoWars.

[03:31:51.826 --> 03:31:54.027]  That's about to end.

[03:31:55.629 --> 03:31:59.232]  Infowarsstore.com and your purchases from the Infowars.
[03:31:59.232 --> 03:32:02.575]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:32:03.095 --> 03:32:07.581]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[03:32:07.581 --> 03:32:09.484]  I don't care what your views are.
[03:32:09.484 --> 03:32:12.508]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[03:32:12.508 --> 03:32:13.289]  That's important.
[03:32:13.289 --> 03:32:14.892]  But we have something in common.
[03:32:14.892 --> 03:32:18.497]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[03:32:18.977 --> 03:32:26.184]  Clinton deep state bag man Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to Congress and the world.
[03:32:26.184 --> 03:32:31.930]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted.
[03:32:31.930 --> 03:32:36.374]  Word is the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[03:32:36.374 --> 03:32:38.136]  From my new home in New Zealand I will...
[03:32:41.034 --> 03:32:44.615]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[03:32:44.615 --> 03:32:46.535]  Not so fast, criminal!
[03:32:46.535 --> 03:32:50.416]  We're going to bring you to justice, and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[03:32:50.416 --> 03:32:55.238]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[03:32:55.238 --> 03:33:05.500]  But the American people know how much you hate us, and we're fighting back at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Ban.Video!
[03:33:05.500 --> 03:33:08.141]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:21.967 --> 03:33:29.196]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Vagich.
[03:33:29.196 --> 03:33:31.558]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:31.558 --> 03:33:32.980]  Welcome back.
[03:33:32.980 --> 03:33:37.766]  This Friday, November 1st, coming from my home in Anchorage, Alaska.
[03:33:38.466 --> 03:33:41.087]  I want to mention my website, earthpulse.com.
[03:33:41.087 --> 03:33:45.730]  A-R-T-H-P-U-L-S-E, earthpulse.com.
[03:33:45.730 --> 03:33:48.091]  Actually, nothing is for sale there.
[03:33:48.091 --> 03:33:56.215]  If you want to get my books or videos, you've got to get them from InfoWars right now, and that's the only place you can get them right now, unless you want electronic versions.
[03:33:56.215 --> 03:34:01.037]  But there's a lot of good articles, a lot of good information, some links at earthpulse.com.
[03:34:01.037 --> 03:34:02.118]  You're welcome to take a look there.
[03:34:03.619 --> 03:34:11.164]  The other thing I want to say, too, is a big sale, you know, on an everything must go sale.
[03:34:11.164 --> 03:34:15.106]  Forty, 70 percent off at the InfoWars store on a lot of products.
[03:34:15.106 --> 03:34:15.847]  Take a look there.
[03:34:15.847 --> 03:34:16.927]  That's ending pretty soon.
[03:34:18.624 --> 03:34:29.110]  Getting back into the subjects of the day, you know, talking about personal privacy and the issues there and sort of where the technology takes us.
[03:34:29.110 --> 03:34:34.373]  25 years of reporting on sort of technology trends generally is what
[03:34:35.093 --> 03:34:53.173]  My work's been about, for those that have followed it, and so starting with the angels don't play the sharp and that they're earth rising and earth rising too, which were really compilations of technologies that would affect us and are affecting us now, written, you know, years before what we see today.
[03:34:53.173 --> 03:34:55.215]  I mean, accurately forecast and predicted.
[03:34:55.695 --> 03:35:05.185]  Not based on some esoteric nonsense, but based on the evidence and over 1,200 source documents cited in those books and videos.
[03:35:05.185 --> 03:35:08.969]  You know, the important thing about all of that is it's not about being right.
[03:35:08.969 --> 03:35:10.711]  It's about, okay, what do we do with this?
[03:35:10.711 --> 03:35:16.978]  And it's always been about solutions, at least for me, because I still believe that there's a chance we can make a difference.
[03:35:17.498 --> 03:35:19.541]  And it really starts with individuals.
[03:35:19.541 --> 03:35:24.407]  You know, people ask me all the time, what's the scariest, worst thing in technologies?
[03:35:24.407 --> 03:35:28.072]  And I say it's human beings behaving badly, and it really is.
[03:35:28.072 --> 03:35:34.741]  All of these things, whether it's the economic issues, the political issues, the technology issues, these are all a symptom.
[03:35:35.689 --> 03:35:36.429]  Let me say that again.
[03:35:36.429 --> 03:35:42.111]  They're a symptom of human beings behaving badly, and I think we can acknowledge that.
[03:35:42.111 --> 03:35:55.514]  And it's easy to take shots at individuals when we see us being distracted now with impeachment discussion again and all of this nonsense, when the really big issues that affect you and I every day are being ignored.
[03:35:56.935 --> 03:36:02.359]  Particularly the privacy questions and the questions of manipulation.
[03:36:02.359 --> 03:36:12.226]  I want to talk about what's happening, sort of the precursors to what's going on in the world that's coming right here to a station close to you.
[03:36:12.226 --> 03:36:14.688]  Because this is the way it works.
[03:36:14.688 --> 03:36:19.372]  In Germany right now, and in Europe right now, they have negative interest rates.
[03:36:19.372 --> 03:36:22.434]  That means you put your money in the bank and you lose a little bit every month.
[03:36:22.975 --> 03:36:28.759]  So people started taking their money out of the bank and buying big bank vaults to stick their cash in.
[03:36:28.759 --> 03:36:32.382]  Because better to have your cash sitting in neutral than losing money every month.
[03:36:32.382 --> 03:36:36.304]  Because that's what negative interest rates will get you.
[03:36:36.304 --> 03:36:39.747]  Now what they're doing in Germany is having a discussion.
[03:36:39.747 --> 03:36:43.169]  A discussion about going to all electronic money.
[03:36:43.169 --> 03:36:47.192]  So you won't have any money under the mattress because it won't be acceptable.
[03:36:48.314 --> 03:37:00.085]  You'll be taxed a negative interest rate if you live in Germany on all your euros on a regular daily compounded thefting interest rate.
[03:37:00.085 --> 03:37:02.106]  You know, and so think about this.
[03:37:02.106 --> 03:37:11.415]  Now, the other thing they're doing in Germany is they're having this discussion right now in real time about requiring you to register
[03:37:12.407 --> 03:37:16.270]  Every purchase of gold over a thousand euros.
[03:37:16.270 --> 03:37:20.233]  That's less than a cougar and ladies and gentlemen, less than an ounce.
[03:37:20.233 --> 03:37:22.795]  And this is why is that?
[03:37:22.795 --> 03:37:24.336]  Why do you ask?
[03:37:24.336 --> 03:37:27.879]  Why do they want to know where your inventory of precious metals is?
[03:37:28.699 --> 03:37:29.539]  Well, take a guess.
[03:37:29.539 --> 03:37:32.681]  They're probably going to tax idle gold, too.
[03:37:32.681 --> 03:37:40.004]  Or maybe confiscate like they did in the 30s and put it in National Reserves when they remonetized after the war.
[03:37:40.004 --> 03:37:41.105]  You know, I mean, the U.S.
[03:37:41.105 --> 03:37:48.048]  did that, you know, after the Depression grabbed all the gold and took it out of circulation and fixed the price.
[03:37:48.048 --> 03:37:55.451]  But this is sort of the precursor, you know, and the other discussion that happens in Germany on mainstream primetime TV in a credible way.
[03:37:56.047 --> 03:37:58.850]  Is the idea of capping your income.
[03:37:58.850 --> 03:38:05.616]  Because after all, anything over 40,000 euros a month, you couldn't possibly need that kind of money.
[03:38:06.317 --> 03:38:19.127]  Now, whether you do or you don't, the point of the matter is, at least in this country, in the United States, we'd like to think that we have the opportunity to make that kind of money and not have it taxed after that at 100%.
[03:38:19.127 --> 03:38:21.449]  100%, which is what they're proposing in Germany.
[03:38:21.449 --> 03:38:25.132]  Here in the U.S., the left is only proposing 70%.
[03:38:25.132 --> 03:38:32.178]  How generous of them to tax at the top rate, going back to where we were in the 1960s, for God's sake.
[03:38:32.722 --> 03:38:34.485]  You know, we don't need to do that.
[03:38:34.485 --> 03:38:36.107]  We can do this much differently.
[03:38:36.107 --> 03:38:47.565]  And one of them is get a grip of the throttle, you know, on the cash register in terms of expenses and where the money's bleeding out of us like a sieve.
[03:38:48.446 --> 03:38:51.647]  Some of the things that I want to talk about today.
[03:38:51.647 --> 03:38:56.289]  You know, where does the money bleed out of the National Reserve?
[03:38:56.289 --> 03:38:58.510]  Out of the public balance sheet?
[03:38:58.510 --> 03:39:01.531]  Mr. Trump, President Trump, I hope you're listening.
[03:39:01.531 --> 03:39:03.352]  The balance sheet.
[03:39:03.352 --> 03:39:04.892]  Nobody pays attention to it.
[03:39:04.892 --> 03:39:06.293]  You know what the balance sheet is.
[03:39:06.293 --> 03:39:08.454]  It's where they store real wealth.
[03:39:08.454 --> 03:39:12.235]  The balance sheet of the nation is our natural resource base.
[03:39:12.235 --> 03:39:17.437]  Oil and gas, coal, minerals, grazing lands, public lands of all kinds.
[03:39:18.611 --> 03:39:21.213]  Is it working, ladies and gentlemen?
[03:39:21.213 --> 03:39:22.154]  Is it working for us?
[03:39:22.154 --> 03:39:22.974]  I don't think so.
[03:39:22.974 --> 03:39:28.518]  Here in Alaska, we have government, essentially government by endowment.
[03:39:28.518 --> 03:39:30.220]  Let me say that again, government by endowment.
[03:39:30.220 --> 03:39:31.380]  We don't have an income tax.
[03:39:31.380 --> 03:39:33.142]  We don't have a state sales tax.
[03:39:33.142 --> 03:39:34.883]  We don't have a state property tax.
[03:39:34.883 --> 03:39:36.044]  We don't have a state income tax.
[03:39:36.044 --> 03:39:42.708]  We have a state income tax on corporations, C-corporations, not S-corporations owned by small businesses.
[03:39:42.708 --> 03:39:46.231]  C-corps of 9%, you know, not too bad.
[03:39:47.097 --> 03:39:59.321]  But the point is, we make our money here based on rents and royalties on our natural resource base, which fuels something we call the permanent fund, which now is being used to fuel part of government.
[03:39:59.321 --> 03:40:06.444]  And we also have income reserve funds and other funds that we've created out of our revenue stream from our resource base.
[03:40:06.444 --> 03:40:11.625]  I don't think we're doing enough there, and there's not going to be time to talk about that, this segment today.
[03:40:11.625 --> 03:40:13.166]  But the point I'm making
[03:40:13.166 --> 03:40:13.586]  Yes, we are.
[03:40:34.605 --> 03:40:36.606]  Alaska is 18% of the U.S.
[03:40:36.606 --> 03:40:37.626]  landmass.
[03:40:37.626 --> 03:40:51.529]  We're more than the West Coast, Gulf Coast, and East Coast combined when you look at our coastal areas and the 200-mile federal limit extending into those oceans, which includes some of the biggest oil and gas basins left on the planet.
[03:40:51.529 --> 03:40:56.091]  That's the national wealth and that's also state wealth here in Alaska.
[03:40:56.091 --> 03:40:59.912]  And what we're not doing is seeing that wealth converted in the national interest.
[03:40:59.912 --> 03:41:01.672]  Most of those resources are exported.
[03:41:02.213 --> 03:41:04.235]  And you know why they're exported?
[03:41:04.235 --> 03:41:09.600]  Because of a thing called the Jones Act, which restricts shipping between U.S.
[03:41:09.600 --> 03:41:11.862]  ports to U.S.-built ships.
[03:41:12.768 --> 03:41:13.268]  The U.S.
[03:41:13.268 --> 03:41:19.492]  built ship versus a ship built in China, the difference is about tenfold, ten times.
[03:41:19.492 --> 03:41:20.633]  So when you use a U.S.
[03:41:20.633 --> 03:41:25.716]  built ship to move raw materials out of Alaska to the West Coast, it's not economic.
[03:41:25.716 --> 03:41:27.457]  It's cheaper to move them to Japan.
[03:41:27.457 --> 03:41:29.298]  It's cheaper to move them to China.
[03:41:29.298 --> 03:41:35.621]  It's cheaper to move them to India, even though it's much, much further away when you start talking China.
[03:41:35.621 --> 03:41:38.063]  And we do it because the shipping.
[03:41:38.897 --> 03:41:42.881]  To ship, as an example, a container from China to L.A.
[03:41:42.881 --> 03:41:43.582]  costs about $1,000.
[03:41:43.582 --> 03:41:49.247]  To ship it halfway back to Hawaii costs about $8,000.
[03:41:49.247 --> 03:41:50.248]  Eight times as much.
[03:41:53.398 --> 03:42:08.450]  So when you have all these natural resources in Alaska, and you only have 750,000 people in Alaska, and it's 18% of the entire United States, and you have all these resources, A, we don't have an infrastructure because the nation doesn't see the need, but we need one.
[03:42:08.450 --> 03:42:15.816]  We need to hook up to the rail so we can bypass the Jones Act and ship our commodities through Canada into the United States.
[03:42:17.230 --> 03:42:18.130]  Well, I think
[03:42:37.160 --> 03:42:40.341]  Trillion dollar opportunities every day in Alaska.
[03:42:40.341 --> 03:42:46.263]  In the national interest, we need to have a broader and bigger discussion about our resource base and the balance sheet of the nation.
[03:42:46.263 --> 03:42:48.904]  This is Dr. Nick Vegas this Friday afternoon.
[03:42:48.904 --> 03:42:50.084]  It's November 1st, 2019.
[03:42:50.084 --> 03:42:52.985]  We'll be back after these brief messages.
[03:43:03.477 --> 03:43:07.160]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[03:43:07.160 --> 03:43:15.145]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[03:43:15.145 --> 03:43:17.726]  It's just that simple.
[03:43:17.726 --> 03:43:24.130]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[03:43:24.130 --> 03:43:24.651]  Others like
[03:43:25.211 --> 03:43:27.312]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[03:43:27.312 --> 03:43:28.032]  Get both.
[03:43:28.032 --> 03:43:29.493]  They're both great for you.
[03:43:29.493 --> 03:43:33.914]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[03:43:33.914 --> 03:43:36.135]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[03:43:36.135 --> 03:43:37.475]  That's why I harp on it.
[03:43:37.475 --> 03:43:41.657]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[03:43:41.657 --> 03:43:44.898]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long.
[03:43:44.898 --> 03:43:45.658]  It's simple.

[03:43:55.031 --> 03:43:56.875]  It's the iodine challenge.
[03:43:56.875 --> 03:43:59.661]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[03:44:02.299 --> 03:44:04.462]  All of our bodies are different.
[03:44:04.462 --> 03:44:07.265]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[03:44:07.265 --> 03:44:10.268]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[03:44:10.268 --> 03:44:15.053]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something you don't know.
[03:44:15.053 --> 03:44:19.358]  But I'm here to tell you, every time I commit and use
[03:44:20.479 --> 03:44:24.423]  The supplements that we sell on a religious basis.
[03:44:24.423 --> 03:44:26.205]  My life completely changes.
[03:44:26.205 --> 03:44:26.865]  I'm healthier.
[03:44:26.865 --> 03:44:28.206]  I have more energy.
[03:44:28.206 --> 03:44:29.027]  I lose weight.
[03:44:29.027 --> 03:44:29.808]  I look better.
[03:44:29.808 --> 03:44:31.369]  Everybody notices.
[03:44:31.369 --> 03:44:37.895]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2 Body's Ultimate Turmeric.
[03:44:38.656 --> 03:44:43.717]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the Gut Fusion from InfoWars Life.
[03:44:43.717 --> 03:44:48.638]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[03:44:48.638 --> 03:44:54.019]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use that I don't talk enough about is Gut Fusion.

[03:45:03.103 --> 03:45:05.304]  The Alex Jones Show!
[03:45:05.304 --> 03:45:10.565]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me, and she had her digital textbook.
[03:45:10.565 --> 03:45:21.448]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table, and I clicked on iodine, and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth, because they didn't get enough iodine.
[03:45:21.448 --> 03:45:25.609]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy, and it's not true.
[03:45:25.609 --> 03:45:28.310]  But Dad, it's right here on the periodic table.
[03:45:28.310 --> 03:45:28.970]  When I click it,
[03:45:29.190 --> 03:45:30.431]  Saying exactly what you said.
[03:45:30.431 --> 03:45:36.514]  And I said, I know honey, that's why I have you take a high quality nutraceutical grade iodine.
[03:45:36.514 --> 03:45:39.036]  It's because it's why you're so vibrant.
[03:45:39.036 --> 03:45:40.116]  It's why you're so alive.
[03:45:40.116 --> 03:45:46.440]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age.
[03:45:46.440 --> 03:45:50.222]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself.
[03:45:50.222 --> 03:45:55.445]  To know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion, are mentally retarded.
[03:45:55.885 --> 03:45:58.627]  On the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[03:45:58.627 --> 03:46:00.828]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[03:46:00.828 --> 03:46:07.353]  InfoWars.com The time has come to defy the Thought Police.
[03:46:07.353 --> 03:46:10.855]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[03:46:10.855 --> 03:46:19.821]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[03:46:21.164 --> 03:46:24.147]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[03:46:24.147 --> 03:46:30.575]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[03:46:30.575 --> 03:46:37.663]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[03:46:37.663 --> 03:46:40.206]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[03:46:40.826 --> 03:46:45.068]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[03:46:45.068 --> 03:46:48.990]  We have a it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap.
[03:46:48.990 --> 03:46:49.851]  It's black and white.
[03:46:49.851 --> 03:46:50.331]  Very nice.
[03:46:50.331 --> 03:46:51.811]  It has the okay symbol on it.
[03:46:51.811 --> 03:46:53.632]  It's a great way to start conversations.

[03:47:23.855 --> 03:47:29.472]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Begich.
[03:47:33.809 --> 03:47:35.350]  And welcome back!
[03:47:35.350 --> 03:47:36.451]  It's always good to be here.
[03:47:36.451 --> 03:47:45.916]  You know, talking a little bit about Alaska and why it's important to the nation, we're talking about the Jones Act just before the break and the idea of a railroad link, and that's actually in discussion right now.
[03:47:45.916 --> 03:47:54.541]  They're talking about a railroad link from Canada through Alaska into the port, eventually into the ports of Anchorage and Seward.
[03:47:54.541 --> 03:47:58.543]  And why they're looking at this is the west coast ports are really pretty plugged up by
[03:47:59.176 --> 03:48:07.641]  The US to the Canadian side and the thought is that you could really do some things by exporting out of the ports here in Alaska.
[03:48:07.641 --> 03:48:10.763]  We actually have Whittier which is deep enough and we have
[03:48:11.972 --> 03:48:12.233]  All right.
[03:48:30.230 --> 03:48:35.874]  The other thing that's being talked about right now and is a big discussion right now and is moving forward is
[03:48:46.741 --> 03:48:48.344]  Natural gas on the North Slope.
[03:48:48.344 --> 03:48:54.493]  We have trillions, tens, perhaps hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas on the North Slope.
[03:48:54.493 --> 03:48:59.541]  They're putting, discussing now, and they're going to decide, I guess, in the next year or two to put
[03:49:00.800 --> 03:49:24.555]  Natural gas liquefaction plants there where we can convert that to a liquefied product and then that's going to be shipped from there out of Alaska actually to Japan to China and to South Korea and the Philippines again because of the Jones Act and economically shipped that material into the U.S.
[03:49:24.555 --> 03:49:29.158]  and we actually have a fair amount of natural gas now a surplus actually in the U.S.
[03:49:29.158 --> 03:49:30.039]  so it's not a problem
[03:49:30.499 --> 03:49:36.824]  But the point of the matter is we ought to have something going on relative to the Jones Act.
[03:49:36.824 --> 03:49:38.685]  Some things that are coming online.
[03:49:38.685 --> 03:49:40.506]  We have graphene, graphite.
[03:49:40.506 --> 03:49:47.391]  A company called Graphite One is being looked at right now as one of the primary supplies.
[03:49:47.391 --> 03:49:53.075]  There's no domestic supply for graphene for the electric economy and the batteries and so on.
[03:49:53.075 --> 03:49:56.378]  So that's a major, major deposit of graphite
[03:49:57.118 --> 03:50:00.120]  In Alaska that's being looked at right now is strategic mineral.
[03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:15.508]  The others are rare earth minerals in Southeast Alaska through a number of companies down there as well as zinc and other metals being looked at in Southeast which are on tidewater in deep water ports already.
[03:50:16.098 --> 03:50:19.819]  But we don't have a way to move that economically into the U.S.
[03:50:19.819 --> 03:50:22.179]  It can go to Canada by ship.
[03:50:22.179 --> 03:50:27.661]  It can then go overseas into Asia, which is most likely where it will go.
[03:50:27.661 --> 03:50:35.323]  In fact, it is where it will go if there's no amendment to the Jones Act to allow Alaska Natural Resources to be shipped into U.S.
[03:50:35.323 --> 03:50:40.004]  ports without consideration for how the vessel is flagged.
[03:50:40.004 --> 03:50:40.704]  That's the deal.
[03:50:42.017 --> 03:50:55.628]  That's the deal or get a railroad so we can actually do something with the balance sheet, ladies and gentlemen, because right now it's about taxing us under the bus is how it's currently rolling.
[03:50:55.628 --> 03:51:01.153]  And the natural resources are being developed, are being developed and sold as if there's a fire sale.
[03:51:01.153 --> 03:51:11.241]  And this has been going on, as I've covered in previous segments since the Revolutionary War, when we were screwing the patriots then out of their continentals.
[03:51:12.883 --> 03:51:28.543]  But here we are in the 21st century again seeing the government screw the average guy by not paying attention to things that are important that are truly in the nation's interest and in all of our interests as well.
[03:51:29.446 --> 03:51:41.276]  This whole discussion, some of the listeners had asked me and sent me some notes about talking a little bit about Alaska, a little bit more about it, because people don't really know the story, and I would agree with that.
[03:51:41.276 --> 03:51:43.778]  Some of the things I've covered in the past, and go to Band
[03:51:48.020 --> 03:52:05.764]  And you'll see a lot of the stuff that we've produced here on the network and covering a lot of different issues that I think are important, important to all of us.
[03:52:05.764 --> 03:52:10.526]  And, you know, when you start to think about this in the context of where we are today with all the
[03:52:12.686 --> 03:52:15.167]  Propaganda bullets flying at us.
[03:52:15.167 --> 03:52:22.288]  You've got to turn the tide, which is you do it with good information, good research and the kind of things that we can do here.
[03:52:22.288 --> 03:52:26.949]  And then more importantly, taking appropriate actions.
[03:52:26.949 --> 03:52:28.670]  And some of those are pretty simple.
[03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:33.891]  There's a article on my website called Change Agents and Reality Creation.
[03:52:33.891 --> 03:52:37.752]  I wrote it nearly 90s before change agents was hijacked by the left.
[03:52:38.772 --> 03:52:45.835]  But the ideas are still good, and they're simple ideas about how to reach out and touch the process, things you can do that empower you.
[03:52:45.835 --> 03:52:47.655]  And people have asked me, you know, what can we do?
[03:52:47.655 --> 03:52:48.336]  What can I do?
[03:52:48.336 --> 03:52:51.977]  You know, I'm just this guy, individual, out there.
[03:52:51.977 --> 03:52:54.758]  And each of us truly have a sphere of influence.
[03:52:54.758 --> 03:52:58.159]  It might be just our families and our neighbors and the people that we talk to at work.
[03:52:59.536 --> 03:53:00.957]  But we can provide information.
[03:53:00.957 --> 03:53:03.118]  The other thing we can do is send information.
[03:53:03.118 --> 03:53:04.179]  Mail it out.
[03:53:04.179 --> 03:53:04.939]  Keep it simple.
[03:53:04.939 --> 03:53:06.520]  Keep it brief.
[03:53:06.520 --> 03:53:10.263]  Handwritten letters to your congressional delegation, your local politicians.
[03:53:10.263 --> 03:53:12.984]  They still get read because there's so few of them.
[03:53:12.984 --> 03:53:14.025]  Let me say it again.
[03:53:14.025 --> 03:53:15.406]  Handwritten, not emails.
[03:53:15.406 --> 03:53:16.046]  They don't get read.
[03:53:17.202 --> 03:53:18.503]  And written notes too.
[03:53:18.503 --> 03:53:21.105]  Not postcards, often they don't get read.
[03:53:21.105 --> 03:53:28.009]  And written letters and envelopes mailed to your Congressional and Senate leadership actually get read.
[03:53:28.009 --> 03:53:32.452]  And tell them what you're doing to report on their activities.
[03:53:32.452 --> 03:53:36.895]  You know, you call in radio stations regularly and talk on talk radio about what they're doing.
[03:53:36.895 --> 03:53:38.196]  You do this, you do that.
[03:53:38.196 --> 03:53:40.658]  Let them know that you actually have a voice that you use
[03:53:42.017 --> 03:53:48.871]  And that you have something to say and you're asking them to consider what you're saying because otherwise you're saying it to the world anyway.
[03:53:48.871 --> 03:53:49.493]  We can all do that.
[03:53:50.214 --> 03:53:51.475]  And those are good things.
[03:53:51.475 --> 03:53:59.562]  The other thing that often happens, we complain all the time, we complain about government, we complain about the government, people we interact with, because bureaucracy is big.
[03:53:59.562 --> 03:54:02.104]  But we need to remember to do the opposite.
[03:54:02.104 --> 03:54:10.831]  I interface with government people all the time, and sometimes I meet really great people that do really great work, and sometimes I meet the opposite.
[03:54:10.831 --> 03:54:13.313]  When I meet the really good ones that are doing great work,
[03:54:14.008 --> 03:54:21.131]  I make a point to try and dial into their boss, but more importantly, their boss's boss, because their boss already knows it.
[03:54:21.131 --> 03:54:21.991]  Do that.
[03:54:21.991 --> 03:54:24.372]  Pass on a good word about someone occasionally.
[03:54:24.372 --> 03:54:28.913]  You do it in the public and the private sector and do it in both ways.
[03:54:28.913 --> 03:54:32.475]  I mean, do it at restaurants when you're served well by a waiter or a waitress.
[03:54:32.475 --> 03:54:35.096]  You know, recognize the humanity in that soul.
[03:54:35.096 --> 03:54:41.218]  If they did a great job and tell their boss's boss, the manager of that store, do something positive.
[03:54:41.898 --> 03:54:45.522]  That affects someone else in a positive way, and you know what?
[03:54:45.522 --> 03:54:48.405]  That's how this thing changes, by human behavior.
[03:54:48.405 --> 03:54:53.549]  How we address each other, how we consider each other in the debate that we are passionate about.
[03:54:53.549 --> 03:55:01.217]  You know, when you think about manipulation and control, and I was talking about some of that going into this in the last segment.
[03:55:01.880 --> 03:55:07.925]  Now the whole issue really boils down to misinformation and the propaganda wars.
[03:55:07.925 --> 03:55:12.509]  And InfoWars, we've been there for so long.
[03:55:12.509 --> 03:55:16.052]  For so long.
[03:55:16.052 --> 03:55:17.814]  InfoWars.com.
[03:55:17.814 --> 03:55:23.679]  You know, my saying when I started this was changing the way we see the world and I still believe that.
[03:55:23.679 --> 03:55:27.322]  And that comes from education and information.
[03:55:27.322 --> 03:55:27.502]  So.
[03:55:28.326 --> 03:55:31.048]  Again, to talk about where is it all headed?
[03:55:31.048 --> 03:55:34.169]  You know, I was talking about a cashless society, what's happening in Germany.
[03:55:34.169 --> 03:55:38.472]  A lot of the people with money in Germany are leaving because you can actually leave.
[03:55:38.472 --> 03:55:40.913]  They don't tax your worldwide income there.
[03:55:40.913 --> 03:55:46.756]  They tax only what you make when you reside there or within the EU in whatever country you reside in.
[03:55:46.756 --> 03:55:50.338]  But you can leave the EU and you can pay tax to the country you reside in.
[03:55:50.838 --> 03:56:05.287]  So my business partner is German, left Germany, not just because of the tax situation and the degradation was really it of the culture and the landscape of Germany has changed so radically.
[03:56:05.287 --> 03:56:06.768]  It's no longer the country it was.
[03:56:06.768 --> 03:56:09.010]  Europe's not the continent it was.
[03:56:09.010 --> 03:56:12.572]  It's totally changed by lawlessness.
[03:56:14.476 --> 03:56:17.397]  In a way that nobody ever expected.
[03:56:17.397 --> 03:56:27.399]  And the remedy is to screw down the population even more in lots of ways economically to bleed the productivity off the population.
[03:56:27.399 --> 03:56:39.822]  And what we see is the big mass migration of the economics moving to Asia where 4 billion people are going to move into the middle class in Asia, Latin America and Africa over the next 30 or 40 years.
[03:56:39.822 --> 03:56:41.603]  We are being de-industrialized
[03:56:42.223 --> 03:56:54.389]  In order to reindustrialize and industrialize even further the East, which not necessarily is a bad thing, but it needs to be honestly reviewed in terms of its impact on this country.
[03:56:54.389 --> 03:56:57.911]  Donald Trump is doing that by revisiting trade agreements.
[03:56:57.911 --> 03:57:03.534]  He's renegotiated NAFTA with Canada, with Mexico, renegotiated Japanese agreements.
[03:57:04.094 --> 03:57:05.155]  We're good to go.
[03:57:22.445 --> 03:57:28.749]  Get good information out and spread the word on what's really going on in the 21st century.
[03:57:28.749 --> 03:57:33.772]  In the InfoWars, what's important is your voice, not just the voice of the hosts.
[03:57:33.772 --> 03:57:37.074]  But you need to pass on the information you get here.
[03:57:37.074 --> 03:57:38.595]  Pick up my books and videos.
[03:57:38.595 --> 03:57:42.317]  When you're done with them, mail them to your congressman with a handwritten note.
[03:57:42.317 --> 03:57:47.621]  Get those books and videos at InfoWars store and pass them on to your congressional leadership.
[03:57:47.621 --> 03:57:50.162]  Maybe we see some changes to policy.
[03:57:50.162 --> 03:57:51.283]  InfoWars, the weapon.
