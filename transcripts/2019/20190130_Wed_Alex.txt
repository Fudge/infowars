[00:00:01.661 --> 00:00:03.602]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:25.396]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:28.838]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:39.161]  On this Wednesday, January 30th, 2019, Global Transmission, we have the very interesting, intelligent...
[00:00:40.413 --> 00:00:52.802]  An informed lawyer for many of the Covington Catholic school children and young people that were demonized and attacked in studio with us to talk about a wide range of topics.
[00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:54.743]  Went to dinner with him last night.
[00:00:54.743 --> 00:00:55.444]  Really smart guys.
[00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:57.165]  We're talking about a wide range of topics.
[00:00:57.165 --> 00:01:00.788]  Stuart Rhodes is there at the Covington school.
[00:01:00.788 --> 00:01:02.949]  He's got some breaking news with Oath Keepers.
[00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:03.650]  He'll be popping in.
[00:01:05.037 --> 00:01:07.298]  Roger Stone to the fourth hour.
[00:01:07.298 --> 00:01:11.719]  Mancow has been off the air for about two years, his own personal decision.
[00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.319]  He's now back on TV and radio.
[00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:15.780]  He's going to be popping in sometime during this first hour.
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.161]  If you think my voice is a little gravelier than normal, you're absolutely right.
[00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:25.602]  You know, just saying last week, I haven't gotten a fever in years.
[00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:26.443]  And I don't have a fever.
[00:01:28.948 --> 00:01:36.651]  Mold and mountain cedar just coating my lungs and my larynx, so I sound particularly toad-like.
[00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:41.173]  It's hard to not cough, but I'm going to hold the line here and get that job done.
[00:01:41.173 --> 00:01:45.934]  You know, I haven't really gotten involved in this whole Ruth Bader Ginsburg is dead thing.
[00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:53.137]  Fox & Friends, as you know, two weeks ago said that she was dead or put a graphic on screen saying the year she was born and then 2019.
[00:01:56.198 --> 00:02:01.763]  So everybody's basically got those already loaded in their computers for different TV networks.
[00:02:01.763 --> 00:02:04.905]  A lot of people have been saying, why hasn't she been seen in months?
[00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:11.250]  And it's the first time ever she hasn't shown up for a bunch of votes, even though she's had cancer treatment and surgeries before.
[00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.555]  So that points towards her maybe being incognizant, maybe on a respirator.
[00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:22.580]  It would be the first time that they keep somebody alive just so that the other party doesn't get somebody into office.
[00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.161]  into that key position there at the Supreme Court.
[00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:36.366]  But Jack LeSobick's got a lot of really top-flight forces and he's right about 99% of the time.
[00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:45.051]  He says that his source that he trusts explicitly, Saul Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was spotted with a trainer at a prominent D.C.
[00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:49.433]  gym yesterday, appears recovered well, enough to work out.
[00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:50.474]  State of the Union appearance?
[00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:56.340]  So I think that is probably accurate.
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.681]  Of course, there could be someone that looked like Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:07.763]  There's a lot of spider-like crones, sea hags there in D.C., skeksis, dark crystal escapees.
[00:03:07.763 --> 00:03:08.403]  But we will see.
[00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:11.084]  We will find out, obviously.
[00:03:11.084 --> 00:03:17.066]  But Ruth Bader Ginsburg wants to butcher as many babies in the womb as she can.
[00:03:19.227 --> 00:03:25.614]  Her mindset and her eugenics-based anti-human mindset is an abomination.
[00:03:25.614 --> 00:03:39.848]  And the sooner we can get somebody on the Supreme Court to reverse the Democrats, who are actually pushing through Dr. Peter Singer and others, who's very influential in leftist demonic circles, to actually euthanize people up to age three.
[00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:42.669]  Including Down Syndrome children.
[00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:48.777]  And of course, many areas of Europe have passed laws to make you abort Down Syndrome children.
[00:03:48.777 --> 00:03:58.989]  We've played Dutch TV programs, news programs, where they talk to a Down Syndrome gentleman, who's very high-functioning Down Syndrome, and tell him, you know, you cost us more than double the average Dutch person.
[00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.110]  You're a worthless piece of crap.
[00:04:01.363 --> 00:04:04.766]  And that dovetails with what just happened, of course, in New York.
[00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:14.114]  They passed a law that a woman's cervix can be dilated, the head can be crowning, the baby can be coming out, but they can kill the baby anytime they want to.
[00:04:14.114 --> 00:04:17.056]  That's law now, with the ghoul governor up there.
[00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:19.958]  Well, now the stories on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.279]  Very important you get this out to people.
[00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.882]  We're going to play the video coming up.
[00:04:23.882 --> 00:04:28.626]  Sick Virginia Dems introduced a bill to allow abortion right before a woman is giving birth.
[00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.593]  And then they lie and say, well, it's if the doctor does it for the health or mental welfare of the woman.
[00:04:34.593 --> 00:04:42.458]  It's not called abortion if there's a complication in birth and the baby dies to save the mother or vice versa.
[00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:43.658]  The baby just died in birth.
[00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.199]  It's not called an abortion.
[00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.963]  So they play a lot of semantical games, but bottom line, if they can't abort your baby, they want to give you a bunch of vaccines to brain damage you.
[00:04:50.963 --> 00:04:55.646]  And if that doesn't work, they'll push to have your son's genitals chopped off because it's so trendy.
[00:04:55.646 --> 00:04:57.687]  They want to kill your young boys particularly.
[00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:06.047]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:05:06.047 --> 00:05:12.472]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[00:05:12.472 --> 00:05:27.965]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.511]  Perk up with TurboForce at infowarrestore.com.
[00:06:19.005 --> 00:06:19.626]  We've got it.
[00:06:19.626 --> 00:06:26.133]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:30.538]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:30.538 --> 00:06:36.185]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:39.518 --> 00:06:47.161]  You know, most of the things we talk about on this broadcast are actually completely admitted and documented.
[00:06:47.161 --> 00:06:55.785]  But they sound so insane that people think, oh, that must not be true.
[00:06:55.785 --> 00:06:58.446]  And I've got a few examples of that here in front of me today.
[00:06:58.446 --> 00:07:01.467]  We're going to be going over.
[00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:06.329]  As I saw this article and I thought, why not go deeper than this and actually get into
[00:07:08.328 --> 00:07:11.129]  The bigger story, the bigger picture.
[00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:18.291]  And what the main causes of mental illness on this planet are, and the establishment is completely aware of it.
[00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:22.553]  Mind-altering parasites spread by cats may lead to schizophrenia.
[00:07:22.553 --> 00:07:27.994]  Daily Mail, common parasites spread by cats that's carried by two billion people may lead to schizophrenia.
[00:07:27.994 --> 00:07:30.435]  Researchers fear, and then it goes on.
[00:07:30.435 --> 00:07:32.576]  Well, they don't fear, they know it.
[00:07:32.576 --> 00:07:34.796]  It's the old joke of Crazy Cat Lady.
[00:07:34.796 --> 00:07:36.017]  Two billion people.
[00:07:36.017 --> 00:07:36.577]  Here's another one.
[00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:45.637]  National Geographic, meet five zombie parasites that mind control their host.
[00:07:45.637 --> 00:07:50.861]  Now, why am I mentioning this?
[00:07:50.861 --> 00:08:01.771]  Because this ties into something much, much, much, much bigger than I will cover coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:10.075]  But it ties into Apple to fix FaceTime bug that allows eavesdropping.
[00:08:10.075 --> 00:08:18.300]  Well, they built the back door in on purpose so that anybody that's in the club, anybody that's in big tech knows how to have that little leg up on folks.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.142]  It was private researchers that discovered the bug.
[00:08:20.142 --> 00:08:26.446]  Of course, we told you specifically about it 10 years ago when the iPhone came out with an exact article and even demonstrated it for you.
[00:08:26.446 --> 00:08:27.487]  That's why we've got to be roof of the air.
[00:08:28.715 --> 00:08:38.742]  Then it ties into this article, Facebook pays teams to install VPN that spies on them, including audio and video, in a secret program.
[00:08:38.742 --> 00:08:48.750]  Now I can get into why they're doing that, but the point is, is this is all being done by design.
[00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:55.215]  And by the time it becomes ubiquitous, or like indoor running water,
[00:08:56.656 --> 00:08:57.956]  Or central heating and cooling.
[00:08:57.956 --> 00:09:06.539]  Once it's just accepted as our environment, then they'll announce the next phase of what it's really all designed to do.
[00:09:06.539 --> 00:09:09.099]  So that's just some of the news on that front we're going to be covering.
[00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:14.501]  Also, the polar vortex tightens its grip on midwestern U.S.
[00:09:14.501 --> 00:09:15.381]  cities.
[00:09:15.381 --> 00:09:25.704]  Incredible satellite footage from above the Arctic shows the huge swirling mass basically boiling down from the Arctic
[00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:28.983]  Right over the Midwest.
[00:09:28.983 --> 00:09:36.691]  They're having to literally light the train tracks on fire in Chicago to be able to keep the trains rolling over the tracks.
[00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:37.552]  That sounds insane.
[00:09:37.552 --> 00:09:39.254]  That's the Associated Press.
[00:09:39.254 --> 00:09:40.595]  Large areas of Minneapolis-St.
[00:09:40.595 --> 00:09:41.656]  Paul are without power.
[00:09:41.656 --> 00:09:44.979]  There's obviously already been death, people freezing to death.
[00:09:44.979 --> 00:09:49.464]  This is the second coldest Arctic blast recorded in the last hundred years.
[00:09:51.633 --> 00:10:00.598]  But there is the literal footage, if you're a TV viewer, of them setting the train tracks on fire so the trains can roll over it.
[00:10:00.598 --> 00:10:12.744]  There's a lot of reasons for that, but a larger reason is it can get cold enough where if you try to roll trains down it, it can actually start shattering the metal when you get 60, 70, 80 below freezing.
[00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.012]  We're going to be looking at that as it unfolds.
[00:10:20.012 --> 00:10:22.956]  A very, very serious situation, obviously.
[00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:32.126]  Now, that said, we have Mankal Muller, who's been retired for two years on his own accord, back on TV and radio.
[00:10:32.126 --> 00:10:33.548]  He's going to be popping in next segment.
[00:10:34.986 --> 00:10:39.489]  Then we are going to have the very informative, I'm really impressed with him.
[00:10:39.489 --> 00:10:49.636]  I mean, I know about his work for years, but talking to him for two hours at dinner last night, this guy knows his stuff, not just about law, but about history, the world, what's really going on.
[00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:53.639]  This guy ought to host a show.
[00:10:53.639 --> 00:11:04.126]  Robert Barnes, representing many of the young people from the Covington Catholic High School, will be in studio writing Shotgun with us for two hours.
[00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:08.282]  Today.
[00:11:08.282 --> 00:11:11.604]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:16.567]  I also have mentioned this, but I think Tucker Carlson knocked it out of the park again.
[00:11:16.567 --> 00:11:20.370]  So I'm going to play it later in the hour.
[00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.410]  Perfect.
[00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:27.334]  Tucker covers Learn to Code meme and Twitter's ensuing crackdown.
[00:11:27.334 --> 00:11:34.238]  You see, they don't ban stuff that's calling for violence or that's truly racist that causes division.
[00:11:34.238 --> 00:11:35.139]  The left wants all that.
[00:11:37.349 --> 00:11:41.311]  What they ban are things that are funny and make sense and score political points.
[00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:57.879]  Because the left is always saying about farmers, or steel workers, or auto mechanics, or machine shop folks, or coal miners, oh, don't worry, I've been hearing this since the days of Bill Clinton, learn to code.
[00:11:57.879 --> 00:11:58.700]  Learn to code.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:04.803]  I remember being in high school when they were telling us about the future economy and we need to learn to code.
[00:12:06.946 --> 00:12:18.088]  And so when you had thousands of layoffs, hundreds at BuzzFeed, but it's thousands of people laid off the last month at the big establishment leftist publications, because the censorship's here.
[00:12:18.088 --> 00:12:31.870]  So since they've knocked out their competition, what the left didn't get was, once you've knocked out all your right-wing and libertarian and Christian competition online, predominantly, you're not needed anymore in the information war, dumb-dumbs.
[00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.651]  So you allow total censorship to come in, then the war is over.
[00:12:35.612 --> 00:12:38.035]  At least the globalists think that to a certain extent.
[00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:41.580]  So it's all over for the unknown soldier.
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:46.366]  So they're having massive pay cuts and huge layoffs everywhere.
[00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:51.473]  Newspapers, mainstream establishment media, everywhere.
[00:12:51.473 --> 00:12:53.796]  And if somebody's got a big contract to pay out,
[00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:55.981]  Like Charlie Rose or others.
[00:12:55.981 --> 00:13:02.143]  Well, then those old sexual harassment cases that got swept under the rug years ago, those get heated up and brought back.
[00:13:02.143 --> 00:13:05.543]  You can get rid of the head of CBS that way, you can get rid of the head of NBC that way.
[00:13:05.543 --> 00:13:07.364]  That's all they're doing here.
[00:13:07.364 --> 00:13:09.344]  So they're imploding.
[00:13:09.344 --> 00:13:17.766]  And I just love all the little leftist mercenaries who enjoyed interfacing with Google and Facebook and Twitter and then censoring everybody.
[00:13:17.766 --> 00:13:19.866]  You're total fools.
[00:13:19.866 --> 00:13:23.147]  Even if you were cynical, if you were Machiavelli,
[00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:31.560]  You know you wouldn't want to get rid of your opposition, idiots.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.101]  But, again, leftists are known for having low IQs.
[00:13:37.101 --> 00:13:46.243]  That's why they're always talking about how smart they are, because the real studies show you're a bunch of idiots, and you just don't get it.
[00:13:46.243 --> 00:13:50.524]  But you're going to get it in the final equation.
[00:13:50.524 --> 00:13:54.945]  Okay, we're going to go to break, come back with Mancow, and then get into all this and more, and then something really sickening.
[00:13:56.357 --> 00:13:59.678]  It's a powerful video up on Infowars.com.
[00:13:59.678 --> 00:14:02.460]  There's a couple powerful videos.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:15.725]  But it's leftist introducing a bill similar to the one, both identical to the one that passed in New York, to kill babies up until they're crowning and coming out of the womb.
[00:14:15.725 --> 00:14:17.706]  In fact, it says kill them once they're born.
[00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:21.010]  So, it's on.
[00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.991]  And it's video them admitting it.
[00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:25.893]  Even some of the Democrats start scratching their heads going, really?
[00:14:25.893 --> 00:14:26.774]  Well, why?
[00:14:26.774 --> 00:14:27.754]  The baby's being delivered.
[00:14:27.754 --> 00:14:29.395]  Why would you kill it?
[00:14:29.395 --> 00:14:32.277]  Because they want to move on to grandma.
[00:14:32.277 --> 00:14:36.700]  And you listen to the eugenicists and others, they want to kill up kids up to age three.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.080]  That's where all this is going.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.284]  So, that's a very important Paul Joseph Watson article that'll only get out if you get it out.
[00:14:43.284 --> 00:14:46.085]  But in the pro-life arena, we've been winning hearts and minds.
[00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:47.086]  The numbers are flipped now.
[00:14:47.086 --> 00:14:48.707]  The majority of young people are pro-life.
[00:14:49.878 --> 00:14:51.926]  We're going to win this fight, but let me tell you something.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:01.304]  We can't be in an echo chamber where listeners think, and I'm not bitching at you, I'm just saying, think about it, oh, we already know all this, so let's not worry about it.
[00:15:01.304 --> 00:15:16.952]  No, you have to get articles like this, with powerful video like this, and email it, or text message it, or print it off, and physically leave it inside a magazine when you are at the barber shop, or the beauty salon, or the dentist, or at a restaurant.
[00:15:16.952 --> 00:15:21.795]  Just dropping InfoWars.com verboten articles around that cost you a few cents to print,
[00:15:22.773 --> 00:15:34.561]  If you just go in every day with just simple things like that and just print, print, print, print, print a key article that you think's important for your demographic, your area, and then talk about it at the barbershop or slip it into a magazine.
[00:15:34.561 --> 00:15:39.944]  Because people have heard the term InfoWars.
[00:15:39.944 --> 00:15:44.367]  And so they know it's for voting, so they'll read it, and that's how we win the war.
[00:15:44.367 --> 00:15:47.209]  It's so powerful.
[00:15:47.209 --> 00:15:48.030]  Every little bit you do.
[00:15:49.918 --> 00:15:52.243]  But whatever you do, spread the live links to everybody you know.
[00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:52.845]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:52.845 --> 00:15:53.606]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:05.614]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:16:05.614 --> 00:16:08.656]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:16:08.656 --> 00:16:14.580]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.363]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:16:18.363 --> 00:16:19.624]  Was there ever a vote?

[00:18:03.021 --> 00:18:06.042]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.

[00:19:08.546 --> 00:19:10.006]  Believe me, I know.
[00:19:10.006 --> 00:19:14.708]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:19:14.708 --> 00:19:17.769]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[00:19:18.249 --> 00:19:19.931]  I still have that energy.
[00:19:19.931 --> 00:19:40.109]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[00:20:03.357 --> 00:20:05.998]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:23.149 --> 00:20:27.255]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:20:27.255 --> 00:20:30.319]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:32.201]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:32.201 --> 00:20:34.043]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:20:34.043 --> 00:20:38.810]  Before we go to Mankow and some important news here in a moment, please do not forget
[00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:42.662]  That they're trying to censor us, they're trying to shut us down.
[00:20:42.662 --> 00:20:46.423]  And then once that precedent was set, they start shutting everybody else down.
[00:20:46.423 --> 00:20:58.487]  Google's parent company, Alphabet, announced last week, it was in publications everywhere, it was in a local paper here in Austin, three separate times, that, don't worry, the cavalry's here.
[00:20:58.487 --> 00:21:01.728]  YouTube's gonna ban all conspiracy theories.
[00:21:01.728 --> 00:21:05.990]  And the videos will not be searchable and will not be recommended, and you won't be able to find them.
[00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.970]  That's called shadow banning.
[00:21:08.285 --> 00:21:12.346]  Well before, YouTube was whatever was popular that voted to the front page.
[00:21:12.346 --> 00:21:14.346]  Now YouTube is whatever they want to force feed you.
[00:21:14.346 --> 00:21:17.667]  You can say, well, what's the big deal?
[00:21:17.667 --> 00:21:19.248]  There's big studies out.
[00:21:19.248 --> 00:21:21.608]  Generation of web addicts.
[00:21:21.608 --> 00:21:25.029]  Children spend more time on YouTube than with friends.
[00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:27.409]  This is the new communications medium.
[00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:34.011]  And then by gaming and controlling what's on it, it's no longer a free open square or a free square, the term I'm coining.
[00:21:35.199 --> 00:21:40.382]  It's no longer a free square, it is a tyrannical, forced-fed system.
[00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:47.786]  So please, remember, whether you're listening on AMFM or watching a TV station, or on Infowars.com, you are the real ambassadors, you're the hope!
[00:21:48.988 --> 00:21:56.990]  To share the live video links, to share articles, to share videos with everybody you know on a regular basis to circumvent the algorithms and the censorship.
[00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:59.451]  We built our own system, our own video platform.
[00:21:59.451 --> 00:22:00.311]  We're taking it to them.
[00:22:00.311 --> 00:22:01.952]  We're fighting hard.
[00:22:01.952 --> 00:22:07.633]  And we're actually holding the line while others get shut down or go bankrupt, including corporate media.
[00:22:07.633 --> 00:22:09.394]  Now joining us is Man Cal.
[00:22:10.034 --> 00:22:18.420]  Man, Cal Muller, good friend of mine, he took off about a year and a half to be in some big movies with Bruce Willis and others and spend time with his family and travel the world.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.882]  We've been having some great long conversations off air.
[00:22:20.882 --> 00:22:25.426]  He's hosting another radio slash TV program again out of Chicago that's already becoming a hit.
[00:22:25.746 --> 00:22:46.212]  Here in just the last few weeks and I want to get him to pop in one of many future interviews where he's going to be here with us hopefully via Skype just to give us his view on the current state of the world and all the big issues and as a father and as a broadcaster being out of the limelight but having some time to actually sit back for almost two years what his perspective is right now.
[00:22:46.212 --> 00:22:48.173]  So Mankal, thanks so much for joining us.
[00:22:49.298 --> 00:22:52.519]  Well, it wasn't two years, it was a year.
[00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:53.659]  But it was incredible.
[00:22:53.659 --> 00:22:56.780]  Look, I've been doing my stupid shows since the mid-80s.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:09.543]  My radio station, probably the greatest rock and roll radio station, if not, well, one of the greatest, if not the greatest rock and roll radio stations, The Loop, went out of business, sold off to Christian Broadcasters, which I was fine with.
[00:23:09.543 --> 00:23:10.523]  And I didn't miss it, man.
[00:23:10.523 --> 00:23:13.244]  I didn't miss the stupidity of radio.
[00:23:15.782 --> 00:23:17.903]  Well, it seems like two years, I guess.
[00:23:17.903 --> 00:23:19.985]  But you had two gigs two years ago.
[00:23:19.985 --> 00:23:23.447]  You quit one, and then I guess a year later you got rid of the other one.
[00:23:23.447 --> 00:23:27.789]  But you just told me you've traveled the world, you've seen a lot of wild stuff.
[00:23:27.789 --> 00:23:38.696]  Well, I mean, probably the highlight or one of the most exciting things was, you know, traveling around Korea, North Korea, and having a sub come up next to me on the boat.
[00:23:38.696 --> 00:23:40.057]  That was pretty terrifying.
[00:23:40.057 --> 00:23:42.078]  A military submarine come up next to me.
[00:23:42.714 --> 00:23:51.297]  But you know, Alex, you really learned what the world thinks of us.
[00:23:51.297 --> 00:23:55.738]  You know, everything that we're rejecting is what the world loves about us.
[00:23:55.738 --> 00:24:09.342]  And what I'm talking about is our Wild West attitude, the Clint Eastwoods, the John Wayne, the no BS attitude that we have, the fact that we love truth and justice,
[00:24:10.345 --> 00:24:16.547]  That we are clear-cut with our opinions.
[00:24:16.547 --> 00:24:24.149]  It's just so bizarre because the world is learning that socialism doesn't work, and communism doesn't work.
[00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:30.371]  I was in Prague, I was in Budapest, and they love our freedom, and yet here we are just pushing that away.
[00:24:30.371 --> 00:24:31.932]  It's quite insane, really.
[00:24:31.932 --> 00:24:38.894]  I mean, talk to any cab driver anywhere in America, and these guys from the Eastern Bloc countries, they can't believe it.
[00:24:39.986 --> 00:24:48.014]  They got out of that oppression, and here we are debating whether or not to have socialism and communism in America.
[00:24:48.014 --> 00:24:48.835]  It's fascinating.
[00:24:48.835 --> 00:24:52.179]  I really think everyone should leave America.
[00:24:52.179 --> 00:24:53.200]  Not permanently.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.505]  No, you only leave America permanently if the presidency doesn't go the way you want, right?
[00:24:58.505 --> 00:25:00.707]  The liberals are always saying they're going to leave America.
[00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:01.188]  They never do.
[00:25:01.949 --> 00:25:07.476]  But, you know, it's important to leave America, and this goes back to early American literature, right?
[00:25:07.476 --> 00:25:13.484]  You have to leave America to appreciate America, but also to see kind of where we're steering off the cliff.
[00:25:13.484 --> 00:25:14.745]  Well, I think you hit the central point.
[00:25:16.553 --> 00:25:20.515]  Has had three or four rounds in the last 150 years of socialism and communism.
[00:25:20.515 --> 00:25:23.617]  It never works, except for the elites that are robbing the people.
[00:25:23.617 --> 00:25:33.021]  You travel the world, they love the ideal and the iconography and the art type of America, but that's exactly what Hollywood and the corporate establishment is attacking.
[00:25:33.021 --> 00:25:33.982]  What makes us strong?
[00:25:33.982 --> 00:25:35.283]  What makes us sexy?
[00:25:35.283 --> 00:25:37.284]  What made people want to come here to begin with?
[00:25:37.284 --> 00:25:41.126]  Why do you think they're doing that as the entire raft of Democratic candidates
[00:25:42.066 --> 00:25:49.293]  Say free health care, free tuition, free everything, when just free health care is bigger than the whole federal budget.
[00:25:49.293 --> 00:25:54.517]  Well, you know, Alex, you know, just quickly, I'm hoping you can help me with the answer.
[00:25:54.517 --> 00:25:56.019]  I don't quite get it.
[00:25:56.019 --> 00:26:02.625]  And the social justice warring, I mean, let's look at even, I know you talked about it, but just Star Wars or anything.
[00:26:02.625 --> 00:26:08.210]  Mary Poppins, and I had all the guys that wrote Mary Poppins, the two songwriters, the Sherman Brothers.
[00:26:08.928 --> 00:26:12.032]  You know, just brilliant guys and, you know, simple stuff.
[00:26:12.032 --> 00:26:13.735]  And we used to be able to do innocence.
[00:26:13.735 --> 00:26:14.816]  We used to be able to do beauty.
[00:26:14.816 --> 00:26:17.359]  We used to be able to do the American way.
[00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:20.263]  Yeah, everything has to have some nasty message.
[00:26:20.263 --> 00:26:24.509]  Like, kids' television is like all, like, perverted.
[00:26:24.509 --> 00:26:24.950]  It's sick.
[00:26:26.479 --> 00:26:29.921]  You know, Alex, I mean, I think about Shitty Chitty Bang Bang.
[00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:32.062]  Yeah, there was the child catcher or Willy Wonka.
[00:26:32.062 --> 00:26:33.682]  It was scary.
[00:26:33.682 --> 00:26:36.544]  But we can't do innocent and sweet anymore.
[00:26:36.544 --> 00:26:41.246]  Yeah, I think I have little kids and you take your kids to a cartoon and there's always a message.
[00:26:41.246 --> 00:26:45.668]  There's always some kind of sexual thing that they've got to be taught.
[00:26:45.668 --> 00:26:47.008]  And it's just it's awful.
[00:26:47.008 --> 00:26:52.351]  And so, you know, our our movies, our music, let's listen to our music.
[00:26:53.292 --> 00:26:54.693]  It's no wonder.
[00:26:54.693 --> 00:26:56.834]  Look, they're not racist.
[00:26:56.834 --> 00:26:58.655]  America's not racist.
[00:26:58.655 --> 00:26:59.756]  We elected Barack Obama.
[00:26:59.756 --> 00:27:00.816]  This isn't a racist country.
[00:27:00.816 --> 00:27:06.879]  It has nothing to do with urban music, but listen to the violence and the misogynistic crap.
[00:27:06.879 --> 00:27:11.001]  And I'll tell you something else traveling the world, there's borders.
[00:27:11.001 --> 00:27:16.424]  And you have to be, now certainly you can travel freely, but everywhere you go you get checked.
[00:27:16.424 --> 00:27:20.566]  And I don't see anything wrong with America having borders, and the world doesn't either.
[00:27:22.088 --> 00:27:30.892]  When you get down to the people, we're not talking about the media elite, but when you said, man, they love Donald Trump.
[00:27:30.892 --> 00:27:33.154]  Now the people on TV don't, the Angela Merkels don't.
[00:27:33.154 --> 00:27:35.815]  Do you really think she's Hitler's daughter?
[00:27:36.761 --> 00:27:41.643]  I don't know, but she might as well be, because the EU was Hitler's plan.
[00:27:41.643 --> 00:27:45.164]  But that's what I see in Europe, that's what my parents go to Europe a lot.
[00:27:45.164 --> 00:27:54.307]  They go every year and they say, people are on fire loving Donald Trump and loving Americana, and they want out from under the globalists as well.
[00:27:54.307 --> 00:28:03.870]  And the good news is you see the yellow vest, you see Merkel being booed with Macron, but then they're so arrogant they just keep moving forward with this program to open the borders up to radical Islam.
[00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:04.350]  It's crazy.
[00:28:06.016 --> 00:28:08.021]  I had just a beautiful time.
[00:28:08.021 --> 00:28:09.866]  Have you ever toured the Christmas villages?
[00:28:09.866 --> 00:28:10.608]  Have you ever done that?
[00:28:10.608 --> 00:28:14.497]  No, I've not had a chance to be in Germany and places around Christmas.
[00:28:15.594 --> 00:28:16.235]  Well, I did.
[00:28:16.235 --> 00:28:19.017]  I mean, this is really what the time off was.
[00:28:19.017 --> 00:28:19.877]  Well, we still can.
[00:28:19.877 --> 00:28:24.420]  And, of course, the one was attacked by Islam, Islamic kooks.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:28.643]  Obviously a lone wolf, part of no known ideology.
[00:28:28.643 --> 00:28:31.425]  But that one in Germany was attacked.
[00:28:31.425 --> 00:28:33.906]  I had little kids and I was nervous, somewhat.
[00:28:33.906 --> 00:28:35.527]  But I hit all the Christmas markets.
[00:28:35.527 --> 00:28:41.011]  I went through Prague and Budapest and Germany and Vienna.
[00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:42.031]  And it goes on and on.
[00:28:44.251 --> 00:28:48.712]  We were in Salzburg and we went to the Sound of Music.
[00:28:48.712 --> 00:28:50.733]  Hold on, here's where we come back.
[00:28:50.733 --> 00:28:53.413]  I want to get into the last of Christendom.
[00:28:53.413 --> 00:28:54.654]  See it while it's still last.
[00:28:54.654 --> 00:28:56.634]  And I'll get into censorship with Mad Cow.
[00:28:56.634 --> 00:28:59.215]  He's famously been censoring himself and where he thinks he's going.
[00:28:59.215 --> 00:29:01.595]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[00:29:01.595 --> 00:29:04.436]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[00:29:04.436 --> 00:29:09.097]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[00:29:09.517 --> 00:29:16.708]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[00:29:16.708 --> 00:29:21.255]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[00:29:21.838 --> 00:29:25.480]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.601]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[00:29:28.601 --> 00:29:31.242]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[00:29:31.242 --> 00:29:32.723]  Get sober now.
[00:29:32.723 --> 00:29:36.084]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[00:29:36.084 --> 00:29:36.884]  It's simple.
[00:29:36.884 --> 00:29:40.086]  Just call Elite Rehab Placement right now.
[00:29:40.086 --> 00:29:41.386]  Please, don't wait.
[00:29:41.386 --> 00:29:42.567]  Your life matters to us.
[00:29:42.807 --> 00:29:44.148]  800-213-9264 800-213-9264 800-213-9264 Call right now before it's too late.
[00:29:44.148 --> 00:29:44.188]  800-213-9264
[00:30:03.072 --> 00:30:06.115]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:30:06.115 --> 00:30:12.560]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:28.033]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[00:31:00.163 --> 00:31:02.405]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[00:31:02.405 --> 00:31:04.146]  There is no set stasis.
[00:31:04.146 --> 00:31:05.387]  There is no managed system.
[00:31:05.387 --> 00:31:07.028]  There is no un-continuum.
[00:31:07.028 --> 00:31:10.270]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:13.612]  So, you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[00:31:13.612 --> 00:31:14.853]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[00:31:14.853 --> 00:31:15.633]  We'll be here forever.
[00:31:15.633 --> 00:31:16.914]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[00:31:16.914 --> 00:31:23.799]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:24.359]  We made it.
[00:31:24.359 --> 00:31:26.520]  And that's really where this goes.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.342]  God's got a big war for you, Reddy.
[00:31:28.342 --> 00:31:28.702]  And so,
[00:31:28.902 --> 00:31:35.367]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[00:31:35.367 --> 00:31:40.431]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:43.293]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[00:31:43.293 --> 00:31:45.675]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[00:31:45.675 --> 00:31:49.178]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[00:31:49.178 --> 00:31:50.199]  I want to go to the next level.
[00:31:50.479 --> 00:31:54.741]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[00:31:54.741 --> 00:31:57.622]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[00:31:57.622 --> 00:31:58.702]  I want life!
[00:31:58.702 --> 00:32:00.043]  I want Jesus!
[00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:04.004]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:04.004 --> 00:32:07.285]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:07.285 --> 00:32:13.548]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:13.548 --> 00:32:16.329]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:17.049 --> 00:32:20.871]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:20.871 --> 00:32:27.355]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:27.355 --> 00:32:32.298]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:33.055 --> 00:32:36.997]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:44.181]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:49.404]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:49.404 --> 00:32:55.107]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:55.107 --> 00:32:59.069]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:03.368 --> 00:33:18.473]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.473 --> 00:33:29.337]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:33:33.564 --> 00:33:36.166]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:36.166 --> 00:33:40.728]  Alright, Eric Mankell-Muller is on the line with us.
[00:33:40.728 --> 00:33:44.811]  He's been off for a year, hiatus.
[00:33:44.811 --> 00:33:48.633]  We talked for 30 minutes the other day about all the amazing stuff he saw traveling the world.
[00:33:48.633 --> 00:33:56.918]  I wanted him to recount some of that, but then I just thought during the break, he's in Chicago and they're having to set the railways on fire.
[00:33:59.139 --> 00:34:01.261]  To de-ice it.
[00:34:01.261 --> 00:34:03.042]  We're at 60-70 below.
[00:34:03.042 --> 00:34:05.184]  Powers out in parts of Minneapolis, St.
[00:34:05.184 --> 00:34:06.425]  Paul, and Minnesota.
[00:34:06.425 --> 00:34:08.467]  This huge record Arctic blast.
[00:34:08.467 --> 00:34:10.709]  They say one of the strongest in a hundred years.
[00:34:10.709 --> 00:34:12.991]  How's that for global warming?
[00:34:12.991 --> 00:34:16.094]  So we'll get back to your Christmas story that we're getting into about through the Christmas markets.
[00:34:16.094 --> 00:34:21.479]  Have to put up these barriers so these llamas don't target it and run it over with these hundreds of attacks.
[00:34:21.479 --> 00:34:23.361]  But first off, the Arctic blast.
[00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:24.182]  How are you handling that?
[00:34:25.717 --> 00:34:30.863]  You know, a bit of trouble starting my truck this morning, but, you know, look, I go inside.
[00:34:30.863 --> 00:34:33.927]  These guys standing outside.
[00:34:33.927 --> 00:34:34.848]  It's cold outside.
[00:34:34.848 --> 00:34:35.869]  I've never understood that.
[00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:37.391]  We're not morons.
[00:34:37.391 --> 00:34:38.112]  It's Chicago.
[00:34:38.112 --> 00:34:39.113]  We expect the cold.
[00:34:39.113 --> 00:34:41.076]  We expect the snow.
[00:34:41.076 --> 00:34:45.121]  Constantly reminded that we should bring pets inside, and I guess people really are stupid.
[00:34:45.601 --> 00:34:48.583]  But it seems to me you would know to bring your dog and cat in.
[00:34:48.583 --> 00:34:53.906]  I don't know, but it's just everywhere you turn, it's bring your dog and cat in and wear a coat.
[00:34:53.906 --> 00:34:54.866]  Really?
[00:34:54.866 --> 00:34:56.347]  It's 40 below with the windshield.
[00:34:56.347 --> 00:34:56.768]  Really?
[00:34:56.768 --> 00:34:57.348]  Wear a coat?
[00:34:57.348 --> 00:34:58.609]  Are we that stupid?
[00:34:58.609 --> 00:35:01.010]  And of course, I heard your ad.
[00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:11.536]  You talked me into getting one of those water filters for my kids and, you know, they're really, we're starting to really find out how polluted Chicago water is, which explains our political system here.
[00:35:11.536 --> 00:35:13.017]  It's, you know, loaded with lead and
[00:35:13.658 --> 00:35:14.579]  Just zombies, man.
[00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:19.506]  Just the land of the living dead here in the middle of America.
[00:35:19.506 --> 00:35:24.353]  Remember all those years ago, and I'm not trying to toot my own horn, but I would come on your show 10, 12, 13 years ago and talk about
[00:35:25.956 --> 00:35:29.758]  Your phones are spying on you, your iPhones are watching you.
[00:35:29.758 --> 00:35:31.139]  Now it's all admitted.
[00:35:31.139 --> 00:35:35.982]  I think that's why they had to take me off the internet in many areas, is because the credibility had gone so high.
[00:35:35.982 --> 00:35:42.405]  And how they had to then brand me as the Sandy Hook denier, that isn't even really the case, that's out of context, just to make it all about that.
[00:35:42.405 --> 00:35:47.568]  But they're censoring a lot of other people now, from Franklin Grand to Ann Coulter.
[00:35:47.568 --> 00:35:49.630]  It's getting a lot worse, but you were one of the first people
[00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:54.935]  Massively censored for doing nothing but for having hit radio show across the country.
[00:35:54.935 --> 00:36:04.446]  I know when Clinton came to town once they threatened to actually take you off the air if you talk bad about Clinton and actually Secret Service puts you in the puts you in the armored limo and threatened you maybe you can recount that story but
[00:36:05.387 --> 00:36:27.411]  What do you make of, I know you've had a rivalry with him, not your rivalry, it's his, Howard Stern, claiming he's Mr. Free Speech, he's gone on air now and said, I deserve to be taken off the air everywhere, it's good to ban me, and then he says these lies about me and has impersonators on, making fun of dead kids, and I just wonder how Howard Stern has turned into Mr. Anti-Free Speech, it's pretty sick.
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.102]  Well, he's controlled by Soros and the rest of them, right?
[00:36:31.102 --> 00:36:32.863]  He is the system, man.
[00:36:32.863 --> 00:36:33.784]  He's part of the system.
[00:36:33.784 --> 00:36:38.587]  It's like expecting Hillary to change something or the system to change.
[00:36:38.587 --> 00:36:41.569]  The system protects the system, brother.
[00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:44.872]  And I've always known this guy's a wig-wearing fake.
[00:36:44.872 --> 00:36:46.653]  And, by the way, he never beat me.
[00:36:46.653 --> 00:36:49.435]  He never beat me.
[00:36:49.435 --> 00:36:55.399]  And you can... I mean, going back to the smoking gun, but all the files I have, it's spent... There was a book out about it.
[00:36:55.399 --> 00:36:57.621]  And this guy had one big fear, and that was me.
[00:36:58.712 --> 00:37:11.822]  And he sent me a dress, and we all... I don't want to be gross here, but we left something in the... It's what you would serve somebody on a shingle.
[00:37:11.822 --> 00:37:15.125]  And we filled that box back up and sent it to him.
[00:37:15.125 --> 00:37:16.446]  And I just punched him in the nose.
[00:37:16.446 --> 00:37:17.527]  He's a bully.
[00:37:17.527 --> 00:37:20.329]  And he thought he could shout me down while he lost.
[00:37:21.391 --> 00:37:21.511]  I am.
[00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:53.471]  I want to tell you something else.
[00:37:53.471 --> 00:37:55.412]  I do my show.
[00:37:55.412 --> 00:37:58.613]  You do your show.
[00:37:58.613 --> 00:38:03.416]  And this guy has 23 writers in a room.
[00:38:03.416 --> 00:38:04.657]  He has sunglasses on.
[00:38:04.657 --> 00:38:06.017]  Everything's typed up for him.
[00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:07.718]  He's reading a teleprompter.
[00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:09.379]  If you notice, he looks down and he's reading.
[00:38:11.412 --> 00:38:14.373]  Uh, I would take him on and you would tear him up, Alex.
[00:38:14.373 --> 00:38:15.614]  Well, here's what happened.
[00:38:15.614 --> 00:38:19.315]  He started wanting to have me on his show, so I did it and I went on some of their other shows.
[00:38:19.315 --> 00:38:22.996]  And they would literally get on the phone and say, now, you're not going to mention ManCow, are you?
[00:38:22.996 --> 00:38:24.577]  Well, we just don't like the fact that you know ManCow.
[00:38:24.577 --> 00:38:25.957]  And I'm like, I'm a talk show host.
[00:38:25.957 --> 00:38:27.378]  I go on other shows.
[00:38:27.378 --> 00:38:28.578]  I do like ManCow.
[00:38:28.578 --> 00:38:30.859]  And they were obsessed with you.
[00:38:30.859 --> 00:38:33.040]  Obsessed with you.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.400]  Yeah.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.041]  Hey, I want to say something.
[00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:38.802]  And I hear a lot about you and you hear a lot about me because
[00:38:39.389 --> 00:38:40.670]  You know, we're buddies.
[00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:45.473]  You know, I wish people knew that you have a sense of humor.
[00:38:45.473 --> 00:38:46.793]  How funny you are.
[00:38:46.793 --> 00:38:51.356]  And, you know, you are trying to do an entertaining show.
[00:38:51.356 --> 00:38:53.577]  They didn't get this about Raj.
[00:38:53.577 --> 00:38:57.079]  I think Bill Maher, I don't agree with him politically, but I think he tries to be entertaining.
[00:38:57.079 --> 00:39:00.861]  So many of these people, like Saturday Night Live.
[00:39:00.861 --> 00:39:03.543]  It's not funny, it's mean.
[00:39:03.543 --> 00:39:06.605]  And you were talking about, I didn't believe this, I didn't believe that.
[00:39:06.605 --> 00:39:08.506]  You talk about, I mean, you and I have had
[00:39:09.352 --> 00:39:11.013]  Arguments.
[00:39:11.013 --> 00:39:11.614]  Battles.
[00:39:11.614 --> 00:39:16.317]  Sometimes over a bottle of wine sitting in Austin or heading out to the Museum of the Weird and hanging out.
[00:39:16.317 --> 00:39:19.539]  And I hate to admit how often I've been wrong.
[00:39:19.539 --> 00:39:21.900]  I don't want my listeners to know this.
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.761]  How often I've been wrong and how often you've been right.
[00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:25.362]  So, it's just amazing.
[00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:27.964]  You never get the credit when you're right.
[00:39:27.964 --> 00:39:32.147]  You talked about surveillance blimps and I was slapping my knee.
[00:39:32.147 --> 00:39:34.208]  You talked about the pedophiles with the elite.
[00:39:35.554 --> 00:39:48.144]  Uh, and, and, you know, the connection with the children entertainers in England, the connection with the directors in Hollywood, and hardy har har, man, I was slapping my knee, that crazy Alex Jones.
[00:39:48.144 --> 00:39:50.946]  And good night, Irene, if you weren't right, brother.
[00:39:50.946 --> 00:39:54.669]  And, uh, and then that surve- remember that surveillance blimp, uh, crashed?
[00:39:54.669 --> 00:39:55.029]  Yes.
[00:39:55.029 --> 00:39:58.332]  And you called me, you go, you go, hey, I thought they didn't have surveillance blimps.
[00:40:00.111 --> 00:40:02.212]  Well, they're so high, the average person can't even see them.
[00:40:02.212 --> 00:40:03.532]  They're about 100,000 feet.
[00:40:03.532 --> 00:40:09.274]  Let me ask you this, because you've been writing about a lot of stuff as well, and you're right.
[00:40:09.274 --> 00:40:12.175]  I mean, society is breaking down.
[00:40:12.175 --> 00:40:15.556]  Children spend more time in front of computers than with friends or parents.
[00:40:15.556 --> 00:40:16.697]  There's got to be a breaking point.
[00:40:16.697 --> 00:40:20.218]  Where do you see civilization going?
[00:40:20.218 --> 00:40:21.158]  Oh, God, brother.
[00:40:21.158 --> 00:40:21.799]  I have children.
[00:40:21.799 --> 00:40:22.439]  You have children.
[00:40:23.422 --> 00:40:26.905]  And if you and I didn't have kids, how different would we live?
[00:40:26.905 --> 00:40:29.207]  I don't think you'd be doing this radio show if you didn't have kids.
[00:40:29.207 --> 00:40:30.267]  Man, you love your kids.
[00:40:30.267 --> 00:40:31.869]  Alex Jones loves his kids.
[00:40:31.869 --> 00:40:33.810]  I love my kids.
[00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:36.512]  And I don't know, man.
[00:40:36.512 --> 00:40:39.174]  I don't want to put it out there in the universe, you know what I mean?
[00:40:39.174 --> 00:40:42.897]  I was in Salzburg with my kids.
[00:40:42.897 --> 00:40:46.800]  We went to all the Sound of Music sites.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.103]  And there had been an attack two days earlier in Germany, an Islamic attack.
[00:40:51.129 --> 00:40:54.152]  This very liberal woman that was taking us around, I could tell she was liberal.
[00:40:54.152 --> 00:40:55.053]  We talked about a few things.
[00:40:55.053 --> 00:41:02.540]  She said, you know, and we're sitting there in the freezing cold and all these little handmade little cuckoo clocks.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.784]  Yeah, we're going back to you going to the great Christmas markets in Europe.
[00:41:06.784 --> 00:41:08.826]  Yeah, yeah, it's kind of our thing.
[00:41:08.826 --> 00:41:10.828]  And you know, the handmade manger.
[00:41:11.585 --> 00:41:12.286]  And all of this.
[00:41:12.286 --> 00:41:14.227]  And you know something?
[00:41:14.227 --> 00:41:15.768]  China.
[00:41:15.768 --> 00:41:17.349]  I'm going to get to the point of the story, Alex.
[00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:19.891]  I hate this, and you probably do as a radio host, but let me just say this.
[00:41:19.891 --> 00:41:20.431]  China.
[00:41:20.431 --> 00:41:21.152]  Japan.
[00:41:21.152 --> 00:41:21.952]  Korea.
[00:41:21.952 --> 00:41:24.814]  You see more Christmas than you do in America.
[00:41:24.814 --> 00:41:27.136]  We're so worried about offending people.
[00:41:27.136 --> 00:41:29.157]  Anyway, so I'm at this little Christmas market in Salzburg.
[00:41:29.157 --> 00:41:30.338]  This liberal lady's talking to me.
[00:41:30.338 --> 00:41:34.961]  She says, you know, we've always been open to the Eastern Bloc people under communism.
[00:41:34.961 --> 00:41:36.422]  Everybody was welcome in Vienna.
[00:41:36.422 --> 00:41:38.303]  Everybody was welcome.
[00:41:38.303 --> 00:41:40.504]  But we're beginning to see that it's not really
[00:41:42.256 --> 00:41:46.880]  That these people are lying, they're not fleeing political oppression, that it's an invasion.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:53.104]  And we really, they're coming from, you know, warm climates into our area here, and they're here to destroy us.
[00:41:53.104 --> 00:41:56.006]  We're really starting, and she was like, I was all for it.
[00:41:56.006 --> 00:42:11.318]  But we're really seeing that it's, Islam is on the march, and, you know, these are adult men that are not fleeing persecution, they're there to... No, exactly, so let me ask you this in closing, Mancow, and at Mancow on Twitter, people can find the show, everything there.
[00:42:12.513 --> 00:42:13.474]  Atman Cal Muller.
[00:42:13.474 --> 00:42:16.956]  That's right, Atman Cal Muller there on Twitter.
[00:42:16.956 --> 00:42:21.840]  How on earth does the establishment think they're going to get away with this?
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.601]  What do you mean?
[00:42:23.601 --> 00:42:25.002]  Well, bringing in the radical Islamists.
[00:42:25.002 --> 00:42:29.065]  I mean, all of this is just crazy.
[00:42:29.065 --> 00:42:32.147]  Brother, I was in Paris and spent two hours trying to find a cash machine.
[00:42:32.147 --> 00:42:34.429]  We were desperate because they'd been smashed.
[00:42:34.429 --> 00:42:38.412]  But look, you know how it's going to end?
[00:42:38.412 --> 00:42:41.214]  Look, go to the Vatican and you'll see the biggest
[00:42:42.575 --> 00:42:45.358]  Single panel painting in history at the time.
[00:42:45.358 --> 00:42:48.821]  And it's the picture of the king of Austria freeing Austria.
[00:42:48.821 --> 00:42:50.503]  And he's eating croissant.
[00:42:50.503 --> 00:42:51.844]  I bet you don't know this.
[00:42:51.844 --> 00:42:52.765]  Maybe I've told this before.
[00:42:52.765 --> 00:42:53.926]  Do you know what a croissant is?
[00:42:53.926 --> 00:42:55.728]  No.
[00:42:55.728 --> 00:42:58.050]  The croissant was the shape of the Muslim moon.
[00:43:02.034 --> 00:43:05.076]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:43:05.076 --> 00:43:11.499]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[00:47:03.307 --> 00:47:05.968]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:26.244]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:26.244 --> 00:47:36.069]  You know, there are countless monuments, huge paintings, historical books written about the hundreds of times that Islam invaded Europe.
[00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:37.630]  In fact, they took what is Turkey today.
[00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:39.411]  That was Constantinople.
[00:47:39.411 --> 00:47:42.513]  Now it's their capital there.
[00:47:42.513 --> 00:47:44.314]  It's Istanbul.
[00:47:45.345 --> 00:47:46.526]  And they got to the Vatican.
[00:47:46.526 --> 00:47:48.047]  They took over Rome.
[00:47:48.047 --> 00:47:50.810]  They would take the women, put them into sex slavery.
[00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:53.932]  And so there's a lot of paintings, a lot of history on that.
[00:47:53.932 --> 00:48:03.800]  And now the average Muslim that comes in understands that history and understands that there is inside the house of Islam and outside the house of Islam is war.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:09.265]  That's why there aren't really any Muslim nations you can go to where Christians even practice their faith without being killed.
[00:48:10.632 --> 00:48:17.818]  So, you were getting into, as we hit the break, how you were being driven around by this German liberal lady who was no longer liberal.
[00:48:17.818 --> 00:48:28.526]  She's like, oh yes, we were all, oh come in, we love you, but they don't assimilate, they hate us, they attack us, they have to put up freedom barriers around all these public places because of the big truck attacks.
[00:48:28.526 --> 00:48:31.909]  It's an alliance by the deep state, by the EU, with radical Islam.
[00:48:31.909 --> 00:48:34.771]  So you were finishing up with that, and then you had one more story about Howard Stern.
[00:48:34.771 --> 00:48:35.732]  Just understand Howard Stern.
[00:48:37.264 --> 00:48:49.308]  He does have 27 writers, he reads off a teleprompter that's in his desk, and he goes on air and constantly lies about me and says things I never said, and says I deserve to be off the air.
[00:48:49.308 --> 00:48:57.651]  When he has NAMBLA members on, talking about how they want to have sex with people's kids, and he has Nazis on, saying the most foul stuff, you know what, he has free speech, he can do it.
[00:48:57.651 --> 00:49:04.414]  He then lies and says I'm sending people to Sandy Hook families, like I've never played this audio, he plays my show's music,
[00:49:05.054 --> 00:49:17.045]  He has an impersonator on, that's done so well, people call thinking it's me on there, going, birthday time for the Sandy Hook kids, and all this, and then I get death threats over it, and he won't stop doing it.
[00:49:17.045 --> 00:49:25.052]  So, he gets the orders, he does it, and everybody calls me saying, yeah, even though his show is very small compared to what you speak, it still has a big following.
[00:49:25.052 --> 00:49:28.254]  Yeah, he's on there all the time saying, no free speech for you.
[00:49:28.254 --> 00:49:30.516]  So it just, it's, it's, it's, and you know, they've,
[00:49:32.257 --> 00:49:40.440]  It's just to see that is very, very disconcerting, man, Cal, but I know you've disliked him for a long time, and didn't he make fun of your dad when he died or something?
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:46.242]  Listen, quick, I just want to say I don't care if someone's Islamic, but I don't think we should have to give up what we are.
[00:49:46.242 --> 00:49:48.043]  I'm all about freedom.
[00:49:48.043 --> 00:49:52.264]  I'm all about him doing his awful show, and you can do your show, and I can do my show.
[00:49:52.264 --> 00:49:52.904]  That's freedom.
[00:49:52.904 --> 00:49:54.665]  That's what freedom is.
[00:49:54.665 --> 00:49:58.446]  And, you know, look, I should be able to punch somebody that does something to the flag.
[00:49:59.315 --> 00:50:02.596]  But, hey man, are we going to have freedom or not?
[00:50:02.596 --> 00:50:09.939]  Being a Christian, the things that I see on a daily basis, the offensive stuff that I see, but man, that's freedom.
[00:50:09.939 --> 00:50:15.082]  So for him to call for your ending is horrible.
[00:50:15.082 --> 00:50:20.484]  We had a meeting along with Opie and Anthony, and they're just a brother.
[00:50:20.484 --> 00:50:22.365]  They're just bottom of the barrel.
[00:50:22.365 --> 00:50:23.405]  They have no opinion.
[00:50:23.405 --> 00:50:24.305]  They're scumbags.
[00:50:24.305 --> 00:50:24.746]  It's filth.
[00:50:26.529 --> 00:50:31.912]  I'm sorry, but showing a breast of a woman is not shocking or dangerous.
[00:50:31.912 --> 00:50:38.955]  Speaking against power, putting everything on the line like you have, is... That's shocking.
[00:50:38.955 --> 00:50:40.616]  That's risky.
[00:50:40.616 --> 00:50:43.777]  I mean, I'm a family guy that likes to take my kids to church on Sunday.
[00:50:43.777 --> 00:50:47.759]  That's ugly and offensive to much of the world.
[00:50:47.759 --> 00:50:51.621]  My father made $30,000 a year as a cabinet salesman.
[00:50:51.621 --> 00:50:55.303]  And when he died, Howard Stern did a bit where he had a funeral for my dad.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.421]  And he dug up the corpse and he raped it.
[00:50:58.421 --> 00:51:01.863]  He raped my father's corpse on the day of his funeral.
[00:51:01.863 --> 00:51:06.025]  And then he used saliva from my mother's mouth for a lubricant.
[00:51:06.025 --> 00:51:07.326]  And then he had sex with her.
[00:51:07.326 --> 00:51:13.850]  And everybody in Chicago went, this is a vile, evil human being.
[00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:15.511]  And that was the end of him.
[00:51:15.511 --> 00:51:18.212]  He never got a foothold in Chicago.
[00:51:18.212 --> 00:51:19.853]  And his career died here.
[00:51:19.853 --> 00:51:21.194]  Because we're not ugly like that.
[00:51:22.196 --> 00:51:26.338]  And so I don't know what kind of person listens to that, but they can have it.
[00:51:26.338 --> 00:51:30.441]  Probably the same kind of people that cheer on Rachel Maddow and think that's news.
[00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:31.461]  Morons!
[00:51:31.461 --> 00:51:41.667]  I was about to say, there's a very pedophilic vein through his show when you actually look at it, and you see that in Hollywood, and I just think at the end of the day, that's what we're dealing with here.
[00:51:41.667 --> 00:51:45.289]  At the bottom of the spider hole is a system that wants to abuse children.
[00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:48.652]  You know the high-fiving, uh, I-I can't say it.
[00:51:48.652 --> 00:51:50.593]  You know the high-fiving kind?
[00:51:50.593 --> 00:51:51.654]  The high- Yeah!
[00:51:51.654 --> 00:51:52.395]  Ha ha!
[00:51:52.395 --> 00:51:57.238]  The stupid... The guy that's 30 years old thinks it's cool that he's got a beer in his hand?
[00:51:57.238 --> 00:51:58.700]  Yeah, I got a beer!
[00:51:58.700 --> 00:51:59.861]  Ha ha ha!
[00:51:59.861 --> 00:52:04.044]  I mean, just stupid, mouth-breathing, violent vile...
[00:52:04.835 --> 00:52:18.083]  That's his crowd and I don't care and it doesn't surprise me that he wants you shut down because he wants everyone shut down that's a threat to him and frankly anyone with any talent is a threat.
[00:52:18.083 --> 00:52:21.225]  By the way, Joe Big sent me this audio a few weeks ago.
[00:52:21.225 --> 00:52:24.266]  I never played it on air and I should play it because
[00:52:26.064 --> 00:52:44.816]  Other people have told me about it, he keeps doing it, where he has a character on, and the guy does a good impersonation of me, and actually says what I say word for word, but then mixes in horrible things in the middle of it, and you can say, oh it's a joke, but they know a lot, like Colbert and all these other people that are political now, they go, oh it's just a joke, but then they say I'm in the KKK.
[00:52:45.976 --> 00:52:46.516]  Alex, brother.
[00:52:46.516 --> 00:52:47.977]  I'm in Chicago.
[00:52:47.977 --> 00:52:49.677]  I don't run into anyone wearing Colbert shirts.
[00:52:49.677 --> 00:52:52.158]  I run into people all the time with Alex Jones and InfoWars shirts.
[00:52:52.158 --> 00:52:53.999]  They're not looking for me.
[00:52:53.999 --> 00:52:54.519]  I see them on the street.
[00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:18.074]  Brother, you're so much bigger than CBS.
[00:53:18.074 --> 00:53:20.496]  CBS is aimed at our grandparents.
[00:53:20.496 --> 00:53:26.422]  The only one that's watching CBS are old folks that can't get out of the chair to turn off the TV at the retirement home.
[00:53:26.422 --> 00:53:28.064]  I want to say something to you, Alex.
[00:53:28.064 --> 00:53:33.349]  The eagle does not hunt the fly, and it upsets me that you're upset by this.
[00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:36.292]  These people are degenerates.
[00:53:36.292 --> 00:53:37.573]  They're hacks.
[00:53:37.573 --> 00:53:38.474]  Colbert isn't funny.
[00:53:38.474 --> 00:53:38.955]  They're mean.
[00:53:40.029 --> 00:53:41.390]  SNL used to be great, man.
[00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:42.351]  It's not anymore.
[00:53:42.351 --> 00:53:43.572]  It's just mean.
[00:53:43.572 --> 00:53:49.756]  Well, listen, I understand that they target who's really popular and they don't control, and the broadcast is huge.
[00:53:49.756 --> 00:53:53.639]  I'm just upset that it's such a unified front of fraud.
[00:53:53.639 --> 00:53:54.479]  In fact, I found the audio.
[00:53:54.479 --> 00:53:57.722]  I don't know if this will translate over well, but folks, we need to play this the next few days.
[00:53:57.722 --> 00:53:58.422]  I keep forgetting.
[00:53:58.422 --> 00:53:59.603]  Listen to this crap.
[00:53:59.603 --> 00:54:00.063]  Alex, hi.
[00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:10.661]  What are lizard people?
[00:54:10.661 --> 00:54:11.461]  So they're bad.
[00:54:29.806 --> 00:54:30.427]  They're bad.
[00:54:30.427 --> 00:54:31.268]  They're horrible.
[00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:34.790]  And a lot of them have risen into high-power positions?
[00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:35.511]  That they have.
[00:54:35.511 --> 00:54:37.352]  And then people go, oh, they wonder why.
[00:54:37.352 --> 00:54:43.237]  Why is the leftist media showing videos of three-year-olds putting money in cheese strings and fat men wearing wigs shaking their asses?
[00:54:43.237 --> 00:54:47.300]  And our children are being ass-whipped!
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:48.301]  Goddammit!
[00:54:48.301 --> 00:54:50.443]  What happens when you kill a lizard person?
[00:54:50.443 --> 00:54:53.185]  Do they revert back to human?
[00:54:53.185 --> 00:54:54.887]  You see the bleed out of their gills.
[00:54:55.407 --> 00:54:56.148]  I could see it happen.
[00:54:56.148 --> 00:54:57.309]  I've seen it happen before.
[00:54:57.309 --> 00:54:58.110]  This is true.
[00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:00.812]  Primal-like authoritarianism pushed by them.
[00:55:00.812 --> 00:55:03.755]  It's disgusting!
[00:55:03.755 --> 00:55:07.619]  So you wouldn't prosecute this guy because he just killed a lizard person?
[00:55:07.619 --> 00:55:10.221]  I'll tell you what I would do, Robin.
[00:55:10.221 --> 00:55:11.703]  Let me ask you something.
[00:55:11.703 --> 00:55:13.425]  What time is it?
[00:55:13.425 --> 00:55:13.965]  Uh, 11 of 6.
[00:55:13.965 --> 00:55:16.828]  No, no, no.
[00:55:16.828 --> 00:55:18.029]  It's birthday time!
[00:55:21.744 --> 00:55:22.825]  And it goes on from there.
[00:55:41.261 --> 00:55:46.847]  So they're laughing about dead kids and basically saying that I'm the one doing it.
[00:55:46.847 --> 00:55:50.772]  He's the one making fun of dead kids and then saying that I'm doing it in my name.
[00:55:50.772 --> 00:55:53.635]  That's true scumbaggery.
[00:55:53.635 --> 00:55:55.377]  Every slam a boost, my friend.
[00:55:55.377 --> 00:55:56.398]  Every slam a boost.
[00:55:57.936 --> 00:55:58.997]  Don't buy into it.
[00:55:58.997 --> 00:56:00.779]  You shouldn't be giving them any press.
[00:56:00.779 --> 00:56:02.922]  The Eagle doesn't hunt the flea.
[00:56:02.922 --> 00:56:05.205]  The guy's a mouthpiece of the deep state.
[00:56:05.205 --> 00:56:07.288]  He is the problem.
[00:56:07.288 --> 00:56:08.309]  And they put him out there.
[00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:12.795]  You know, look, they have room for somebody outrageous on radio, and they put him out there.
[00:56:12.795 --> 00:56:13.696]  It's soft.
[00:56:14.398 --> 00:56:14.999]  It's weak.
[00:56:14.999 --> 00:56:16.781]  There's nothing dangerous about it.
[00:56:16.781 --> 00:56:23.448]  Sure, they just contacted, the attorney's family contacted Roku two weeks ago and said, he's sending people to our houses, he's saying our kids didn't die.
[00:56:23.448 --> 00:56:24.149]  Not even true.
[00:56:24.149 --> 00:56:26.211]  Never happened that I sent them to their house.
[00:56:26.211 --> 00:56:27.172]  Roku takes me off.
[00:56:28.973 --> 00:56:33.894]  And then meanwhile, Howard Stern's saying what I'm supposedly saying, and then he's promoted by the corporate system.
[00:56:33.894 --> 00:56:36.655]  Just shows how it's all a giant fraud.
[00:56:36.655 --> 00:56:39.136]  Well, Mancow, thanks for spending time with us, mancow.com.
[00:56:39.136 --> 00:56:42.236]  I'm going to be on your broadcast, I think, next Tuesday.
[00:56:42.236 --> 00:56:48.078]  And of course, that's a great broadcast at mancowmuller on Twitter or at mancow.com.
[00:56:48.078 --> 00:56:50.218]  Mancow, talk to you soon, brother.
[00:56:50.218 --> 00:56:50.818]  All right, Alex.
[00:56:50.818 --> 00:56:51.999]  Be strong.
[00:56:51.999 --> 00:56:52.379]  I am.
[00:56:52.379 --> 00:56:52.739]  I'm good.
[00:56:52.739 --> 00:56:54.419]  And listen, I wasn't whining about it.
[00:56:54.419 --> 00:56:56.400]  It's just that they have stolen my identity.
[00:56:57.591 --> 00:57:01.337]  And in my name, they're saying all these things I never said.
[00:57:01.337 --> 00:57:05.062]  That I'm in the KKK, that I'm harassing dead kids' families.
[00:57:05.062 --> 00:57:07.105]  All this crap, out of context, twisted lies.
[00:57:09.326 --> 00:57:10.707]  They're coming for everybody now.
[00:57:10.707 --> 00:57:12.328]  I didn't even really plug this hour.
[00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:14.409]  Listen, we won't be here if you don't buy the products.
[00:57:14.409 --> 00:57:17.692]  Supermelt Vitality, Supermelt Vitality have been our best seller.
[00:57:17.692 --> 00:57:22.615]  We've had trouble getting the log crafted the way it's done, and so the contract's over.
[00:57:22.615 --> 00:57:29.279]  It's the last run of it, and we're going to end the 50% off here on Friday, because then for what's left, we're going to sell it at full price.

[00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:45.154]  Everything ends on Friday.

[00:57:47.336 --> 00:57:47.877]  Thank you so much.
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:55.023]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:57:55.023 --> 00:58:01.468]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[00:58:57.799 --> 00:58:58.280]  It's you!
[00:58:59.363 --> 00:59:01.864]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:01.864 --> 00:59:03.104]  You are the InfoWarrant.
[00:59:03.104 --> 00:59:06.165]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:31.919]  Let everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:31.919 --> 00:59:39.885]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:39.885 --> 00:59:46.931]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:46.931 --> 00:59:49.673]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[00:59:52.737 --> 01:00:09.709]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.709 --> 01:00:13.752]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:13.752 --> 01:00:15.533]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.488 --> 01:00:24.710]  So if you're an establishment shill, like Howard Stern, you can get up there and make fun of dead Sandy Hook kids all day.
[01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:26.810]  The media praises you for it.
[01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:30.671]  As long as you're doing it in my name, then you're fine.
[01:00:30.671 --> 01:00:36.893]  But if you're really exposing the fact that Google and Apple and others are moving to China, helping oppress their own people, transferring U.S.
[01:00:36.893 --> 01:00:38.634]  technology, well then you get taken off air.
[01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:39.274]  You get blocked.
[01:00:39.274 --> 01:00:40.914]  And that's what's happening.
[01:00:40.914 --> 01:00:43.675]  Twitter doesn't take you off of your ISIS or Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:45.165 --> 01:00:47.026]  Or you're creating racial division.
[01:00:47.026 --> 01:00:55.272]  You have a civil rights lawyer, famous, represented a lot of black folks who were actually persecuted, come on later, and he'll break that down.
[01:00:55.272 --> 01:01:04.858]  The establishment funds cases in groups that are divisive, not cases where it's a slam dunk that somebody was actually abused for a racial reason.
[01:01:04.858 --> 01:01:09.181]  So that's coming up with our next guest in studio.
[01:01:09.181 --> 01:01:13.885]  But I wanted to play a clip from this very powerful Tucker Carlson piece
[01:01:15.236 --> 01:01:31.409]  That's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com that really needs to be shared because Twitter has begun banning people, banning them, not just freezing their account, that respond to any public figure, leftist journalist with, learn to code meme.
[01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:37.170]  Now they're not doing it because it's a hate symbol or whatever the left defines it as.
[01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:40.571]  They're doing it because it's the truth and it's effective.
[01:01:40.571 --> 01:01:47.334]  And it's what they told us about the service economy for the last 30 years while we were being purposely de-industrialized.
[01:01:47.334 --> 01:01:50.176]  So Tucker does a great job, but the last piece of the equation is...
[01:01:51.223 --> 01:02:05.323]  They're banning it because it's witty, it's common sense, it makes sense, and these little snowflakes that are in this authoritarian system can't handle somebody giving them their own medicine back.
[01:02:05.323 --> 01:02:08.127]  So here is that clip from last night's Tucker Carlson.
[01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:12.336]  Well, the past couple weeks have been pretty awful for American journalists.
[01:02:12.336 --> 01:02:21.388]  Hundreds of reporters and editors at places like Huffington Post and BuzzFeed lost their jobs, victims of systemic changes to their industry.
[01:02:21.388 --> 01:02:23.912]  No matter what you think of those sites, it's sad.
[01:02:23.912 --> 01:02:26.595]  Anyone who's lost his job knows it's very tough.
[01:02:27.416 --> 01:02:31.098]  Now those journalists suddenly have a lot in common with millions of other Americans.
[01:02:31.098 --> 01:02:34.539]  Factory workers, loggers, retail clerks, coal miners.
[01:02:34.539 --> 01:02:41.162]  All of them and many more have seen their way of life disappear thanks to technology or outsourcing or private equity.
[01:02:41.162 --> 01:02:43.783]  This kind of thing has been going on a long time.
[01:02:43.783 --> 01:02:51.006]  Now in previous cycles, what we used to call creative destruction, journalists had ready advice for newly unemployed blue-collar workers.
[01:02:51.006 --> 01:02:52.627]  Just learn to code.
[01:02:52.627 --> 01:02:53.667]  Coding is the future.
[01:02:53.667 --> 01:02:55.008]  Stop whining and embrace it.
[01:02:55.928 --> 01:02:58.669]  Here's a selection of headlines you might remember on that subject.
[01:02:58.669 --> 01:02:59.950]  This one's from NPR.
[01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:04.291]  From coal to code, a new path for laid-off miners in Kentucky.
[01:03:04.291 --> 01:03:09.994]  From WIRED, the tech evangelist magazine, can you teach a coal miner to code?
[01:03:09.994 --> 01:03:15.296]  From CBS News, out-of-work coal miners find new work in computer industry.
[01:03:15.296 --> 01:03:18.477]  And this from Bloomberg, Appalachian miners are learning to code.
[01:03:19.315 --> 01:03:22.859]  And from the venerable New York Times, the coders of Kentucky.
[01:03:22.859 --> 01:03:23.320]  See?
[01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.782]  It's that simple.
[01:03:24.782 --> 01:03:29.587]  Let's say you spent 30 years making a solid middle class living in a paper mill in northern New Hampshire.
[01:03:29.587 --> 01:03:32.851]  Then one day the mill shuts down, sold for scrap to China.
[01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.553]  Happened a lot, but no problem!
[01:03:34.553 --> 01:03:35.795]  Just learn to code.
[01:03:35.795 --> 01:03:36.876]  Everyone in Brooklyn's doing it.
[01:03:37.777 --> 01:03:45.282]  Well, coding was never a real solution to any of this, obviously, but it had the effect of making journalists feel even more self-satisfied.
[01:03:45.282 --> 01:03:46.183]  And of course, that was the point.
[01:03:46.183 --> 01:03:47.824]  It's always the point, actually.
[01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:50.246]  Fast forward to this month.
[01:03:50.246 --> 01:03:56.230]  Someone on Twitter came up with a pretty brilliant piece of advice for all those laid-off journalists trying to figure out what to do with their lives.
[01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:57.290]  Learn to code!
[01:03:58.271 --> 01:03:59.172]  Perfect.
[01:03:59.172 --> 01:04:03.116]  Suddenly, Learn to Code was everywhere on Twitter.
[01:04:03.116 --> 01:04:05.298]  But journalists didn't see the humor in this at all.
[01:04:05.298 --> 01:04:11.365]  A former New Yorker employee called Talia Lavin called the phrase, quote, far-right hate.
[01:04:11.365 --> 01:04:13.347]  People who went to Wesleyan shouldn't have to.
[01:04:13.707 --> 01:04:15.388]  Learn to code.
[01:04:15.388 --> 01:04:24.133]  So they complained to the censorship authorities at Twitter, who immediately concluded that asking someone to learn to code might be, quote, targeted harassment.
[01:04:24.133 --> 01:04:29.056]  But only when it's directed at people who used to work at BuzzFeed.
[01:04:29.056 --> 01:04:32.959]  For the paper mill guy in New Hampshire, coding is still the future.
[01:04:33.925 --> 01:04:41.528]  Let's be clear, Twitter especially, and Facebook as well, are bullying re-education camp digital brainwashing centers.
[01:04:41.528 --> 01:04:45.050]  So they all gang up, they all bully, that's all encouraged.
[01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:49.912]  But if you organize back with something witty to them that they've used on you, well now you're banning.
[01:04:49.912 --> 01:04:53.653]  It's all a rigged system for cowards to bully and attack.
[01:04:53.653 --> 01:04:54.714]  That's what the left is.
[01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:04.011]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:05:04.011 --> 01:05:10.452]  While coffee, candy and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[01:05:10.452 --> 01:05:25.916]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity and a boost of energy on the go.
[01:05:25.916 --> 01:05:29.657]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water and enjoy!
[01:05:31.468 --> 01:05:39.533]  With 14 servings per box for a two-week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[01:05:39.533 --> 01:05:45.938]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[01:05:45.938 --> 01:05:47.939]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[01:05:47.939 --> 01:05:50.521]  Perk up with TurboForce at infowarrestore.com.
[01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:04.433]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars.
[01:06:04.433 --> 01:06:18.200]  And in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios.
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:18.540]  We're good.
[01:06:38.626 --> 01:06:42.529]  InfoWars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:55.139]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[01:06:55.139 --> 01:07:04.267]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes.
[01:07:04.267 --> 01:07:05.868]  Demand truth.
[01:07:05.868 --> 01:07:07.569]  Demand InfoWars.
[01:07:09.374 --> 01:07:10.458]  InfoWars.
[01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:11.663]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:07:11.663 --> 01:07:11.985]  Today.
[01:07:17.938 --> 01:07:25.921]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[01:07:25.921 --> 01:07:38.484]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[01:07:40.505 --> 01:07:44.308]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space-time.
[01:07:44.308 --> 01:07:48.631]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:53.414]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[01:07:53.414 --> 01:08:09.525]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[01:08:14.593 --> 01:08:16.676]  We are drugged out!
[01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.981]  We are following other people's opinions!
[01:08:20.083 --> 01:08:22.885]  We are controlled by the media.
[01:08:22.885 --> 01:08:24.747]  Today, it all changes.
[01:08:24.747 --> 01:08:27.509]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[01:08:27.509 --> 01:08:30.571]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[01:08:30.571 --> 01:08:35.334]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[01:08:35.334 --> 01:08:38.457]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[01:08:38.457 --> 01:08:40.678]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[01:08:40.678 --> 01:08:43.240]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.902]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:08:44.902 --> 01:08:46.843]  We have the resources for
[01:08:49.505 --> 01:08:52.988]  Sometimes you need some crazy motherf***ers to change something.
[01:08:52.988 --> 01:08:54.450]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:56.051]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[01:08:56.051 --> 01:08:57.132]  They say Trump's crazy.
[01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:58.213]  They say I'm crazy.
[01:08:58.213 --> 01:09:00.615]  But I'm here to show love.
[01:09:00.615 --> 01:09:05.760]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:09.904]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:09:09.904 --> 01:09:11.665]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:34.705]  InfoWars.
[01:09:34.705 --> 01:09:35.906]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:09:35.906 --> 01:09:36.267]  Today.
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:47.966]  Alright folks, we're now well into the second hour and riding shotgun for the rest of the broadcast today is Robert Barnes.
[01:09:47.966 --> 01:09:49.147]  He's a trial lawyer.
[01:09:49.147 --> 01:09:52.790]  He wins high-profile cases for clients in civil, criminal, and constitutional law.
[01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:56.934]  He was featured in the UK Times and AP as America's most successful political gambler.
[01:09:56.934 --> 01:10:04.261]  Robert Barnes has vowed to sue the reporters and celebrities who have perpetuated the false statements and attacked the Covington High School students.
[01:10:04.261 --> 01:10:07.123]  In fact guys, cue up the clip if you can, the full clip.
[01:10:08.244 --> 01:10:11.607]  Where he gets, where Bill Maher gets into the attack.
[01:10:11.607 --> 01:10:12.909]  I want to play that.
[01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:15.791]  He's also given them 48 hours to retract and apologize.
[01:10:15.791 --> 01:10:17.313]  That now was last week.
[01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:20.415]  After which he will begin filing defamation lawsuits.
[01:10:20.415 --> 01:10:21.877]  So it's great to have you here in town.
[01:10:21.877 --> 01:10:22.738]  Thanks for coming to town.
[01:10:22.738 --> 01:10:23.098]  Absolutely.
[01:10:23.098 --> 01:10:23.899]  Glad to be here.
[01:10:23.899 --> 01:10:27.182]  Well, I had a great time last night at dinner with you.
[01:10:27.182 --> 01:10:29.264]  Us comparing notes just about how the world really works.
[01:10:29.884 --> 01:10:34.385]  The whole fake civil rights movement, because I know you've been involved in the civil rights movement, and where you see the whole world going.
[01:10:34.385 --> 01:10:39.107]  So in part two of the interview next hour, we should get more into that and just where you see this country and the world going.
[01:10:39.107 --> 01:10:49.970]  But the latest update on the story still captivating people's attention, the attempted frame-up by the media and leftist groups of the Covington High School students that you represent.
[01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:51.110]  Absolutely.
[01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:59.496]  So what we're sending out this week are intent to sue letters that are going to be demand letters that no longer can they just simply delete or correct or apologize.
[01:10:59.496 --> 01:11:01.577]  They have to take further remedial action.
[01:11:01.577 --> 01:11:02.738]  They can delete their account.
[01:11:02.738 --> 01:11:06.600]  They can pin a tweet that says what they said was wrong about the Covington kids.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.822]  They can propose other settlement terms.
[01:11:08.822 --> 01:11:10.943]  But those will be the terms that will be sent out this week.
[01:11:11.443 --> 01:11:25.887]  And if they don't remedy it within a week, they don't come up with some sort of settlement solution that is satisfactory to the family, that protects these families' kids moving forward, then the net effect is going to be they're going to be sued and sooner or later they're going to face a Covington judge and then a Covington jury.
[01:11:27.637 --> 01:11:31.402]  Why was this an important case to you, and why do you think it captured people's attention so much?
[01:11:31.402 --> 01:11:41.976]  Because it really was, as the President said, as I and others said, it was a tipping point where people really got how fake and how organized mainstream news is to put out unified deception.
[01:11:41.976 --> 01:11:42.417]  Absolutely.
[01:11:42.517 --> 01:11:48.759]  I mean, what it is, is it's really sort of this last vestige of, that's outside of the cultural mind control of the left.
[01:11:48.759 --> 01:12:01.183]  So the left overwhelmingly has influence in the entertainment industry, in the educational industry, most university faculty are to the left, most public education teachers are to the left, most of Hollywood is to the left, most of the mainstream media is to the left.
[01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:06.745]  So they have so much of the control of the means by which we shape people's minds in the country and in the world.
[01:12:07.265 --> 01:12:13.991]  One of the few places left that's a pushback against that, other than people like yourself Alex, are Christian schools.
[01:12:13.991 --> 01:12:28.162]  Little evangelical schools, little Catholic schools across the country that are teaching traditional values, traditional ideas, traditional ideals, respecting the sort of tradition of empiricism that the Western educational structure... Little islands of sanity and wholesomeness.
[01:12:28.442 --> 01:12:30.163]  Exactly, that's exactly what it is.
[01:12:30.163 --> 01:12:40.911]  And if so offends the institutional left and the mindset left and the mind control left, that their obsession is we have to suppress it, we have to shame it, we have to censor it, we have to repress it.
[01:12:40.911 --> 01:12:44.354]  And they chose a bunch of kids, kids going to Washington D.C.
[01:12:44.354 --> 01:12:46.896]  who are just enamored with being in the nation's capital.
[01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:47.697]  We're good to go.
[01:13:05.453 --> 01:13:13.014]  And Democrat members of Congress, days after it happened, saying ban the red hat, ban people under the age of 18 wearing it.
[01:13:13.014 --> 01:13:20.416]  Such open authoritarianism when they knew good and well that the quote elder is a political activist, he'd marched over and tried to cause a confrontation.
[01:13:20.416 --> 01:13:22.696]  The kids had already moved once away.
[01:13:22.696 --> 01:13:27.937]  If you watch the full 30 minute video, trying to get away from them, they were waiting for their bus.
[01:13:27.937 --> 01:13:32.858]  But the whole media said that no, they were impeding the poor native who just tried to walk up the stairs, that poor baby.
[01:13:33.658 --> 01:13:34.099]  We're good
[01:13:48.575 --> 01:13:48.955]  We're good.
[01:14:04.313 --> 01:14:04.753]  Precisely.
[01:14:04.753 --> 01:14:05.914]  I mean, you look at what happened.
[01:14:05.914 --> 01:14:16.358]  These kids are being taunted by this group of black Hebrew Israelites, who are calling them Cracker, who are actually also making fun of the Native Americans in the area, calling them Uncle Tomahawk.
[01:14:16.358 --> 01:14:18.098]  All of these racist references.
[01:14:18.098 --> 01:14:22.900]  These kids don't try to get into a fight with them, don't try to dispute them, don't try to question them.
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.221]  Instead, all they try to do is, hey, let's do some school cheers.
[01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:30.425]  And part of their school cheers is the Haka, which is one of the great tribal dances anywhere in the world.
[01:14:30.425 --> 01:14:32.867]  And doing the Haka isn't disrespect, it's respect!
[01:14:32.867 --> 01:14:33.748]  It's honor!
[01:14:33.748 --> 01:14:43.697]  It's one of the tribal traditions of the Haurari tribe from New Zealand and from South Australia and other parts around the sort of the Tahitian world, all the way up through there.
[01:14:43.697 --> 01:14:48.000]  And they do the New Zealand rugby band, the rugby team, does it every game.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.003]  They sort of invite their competition to come out and they do their Haka.
[01:14:51.303 --> 01:14:54.064]  And they're called the All Blacks for the New Zealand rugby team.
[01:14:54.064 --> 01:14:58.684]  And it's a great tradition that's one of the greatest sports dances of any kind in the world.
[01:14:58.684 --> 01:15:03.505]  Here they are doing this and not long after that they see a Native American come up with a drum.
[01:15:03.505 --> 01:15:04.806]  So they think he's participating.
[01:15:04.806 --> 01:15:06.146]  They think he's supporting.
[01:15:06.146 --> 01:15:07.366]  That's why they're doing the cheers.
[01:15:07.366 --> 01:15:08.446]  They think he's part of it.
[01:15:08.446 --> 01:15:09.746]  They don't think he's against them.
[01:15:09.746 --> 01:15:10.927]  They think he's with them.
[01:15:10.927 --> 01:15:16.828]  And then all of a sudden the people behind him are starting to chant names at him, call them names, tell them to go back to Europe.
[01:15:16.828 --> 01:15:18.008]  We're going to cut your organs out.
[01:15:18.388 --> 01:15:20.212]  Oh, it's just one horrible thing after another.
[01:15:20.212 --> 01:15:23.359]  So you have such innocence coming up against this out of control.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.521]  Crazed leftist evil.
[01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:31.043]  Because this same guy, this same native elder, had gone to a Catholic church during mass.
[01:15:31.043 --> 01:15:33.384]  Twenty people beating a drum, trying to get his ass kicked.
[01:15:33.384 --> 01:15:35.945]  He goes to universities, confronts people.
[01:15:35.945 --> 01:15:37.826]  It's the same provocateur garbage.
[01:15:37.826 --> 01:15:43.028]  I wonder what's going to happen to him, because he went on NPR and other news channels saying he was afraid.
[01:15:43.028 --> 01:15:46.990]  He was protecting these poor black people from these evil white demons.
[01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:48.190]  But in reality, we know what he was doing.
[01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:52.232]  He was trying to lead the black Israelites into a confrontation to have a racial
[01:15:54.313 --> 01:16:00.617]  A doctor's office visit for erectile dysfunction on my smartphone?
[01:16:00.617 --> 01:16:01.658]  That's crazy!

[01:17:28.293 --> 01:17:32.215]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.215 --> 01:17:33.756]  I sued the IRS and won.

[01:20:11.053 --> 01:20:13.696]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:13.696 --> 01:20:18.941]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:18.941 --> 01:20:21.104]  Robert Barnes is here.
[01:20:22.364 --> 01:20:25.525]  He, of course, has represented a lot of famous people.
[01:20:25.525 --> 01:20:27.366]  Leslie Snipes, you name it.
[01:20:27.366 --> 01:20:30.927]  He takes on the system many times at Barnes underscore Law.
[01:20:30.927 --> 01:20:33.288]  Barnes Law, LLP.
[01:20:33.288 --> 01:20:35.489]  And he's represented the Covington kids, some of them.
[01:20:35.489 --> 01:20:37.389]  Others have some other lawyers as well.
[01:20:37.389 --> 01:20:38.510]  And you say, great, the more the merrier.
[01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:42.931]  You're doing it pro bono just to get other lawyers to trigger and get the stampede going.
[01:20:42.931 --> 01:20:44.172]  Because as you've said, this is
[01:20:45.012 --> 01:20:48.315]  Lawfare, they're using to shut down conservatives and others with disinfo.
[01:20:48.315 --> 01:20:51.077]  This is clearly premeditated garbage.
[01:20:51.077 --> 01:20:58.503]  With a group that works for Facebook called NowThis being the first to put both videos out of these so-called native women a few months ago in D.C.
[01:20:58.503 --> 01:20:58.763]  again.
[01:20:58.763 --> 01:21:00.404]  I was at a public place.
[01:21:00.404 --> 01:21:01.185]  People knew I was there.
[01:21:01.185 --> 01:21:01.685]  They come up.
[01:21:01.685 --> 01:21:04.328]  They call me a white monkey.
[01:21:04.328 --> 01:21:05.669]  My mother's married to her brother.
[01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:10.312]  I had to go back to Europe and I said, man, that's really racist.
[01:21:10.312 --> 01:21:12.153]  And she'd go, I'm just a veteran.
[01:21:12.153 --> 01:21:13.834]  Why are you harassing me?
[01:21:13.834 --> 01:21:15.215]  We have the raw footage.
[01:21:15.215 --> 01:21:18.677]  Well, this was all edited together and they work in concert.
[01:21:18.677 --> 01:21:22.319]  So the left is all about deception.
[01:21:22.319 --> 01:21:25.341]  But okay, I'm not as sympathetic as these young people.
[01:21:25.341 --> 01:21:26.482]  And I also got back in their face.
[01:21:27.642 --> 01:21:31.905]  That's why they're in so much trouble with the situation with Covington, because they handled it just right.
[01:21:31.905 --> 01:21:32.985]  That's precisely right.
[01:21:32.985 --> 01:21:35.587]  These kids did what we would want our kids to do.
[01:21:35.587 --> 01:21:42.551]  They didn't react, they didn't respond, they didn't attack, they didn't try to initiate or instigate or further the confrontation.
[01:21:42.551 --> 01:21:44.432]  Instead they just did their own school cheers.
[01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:54.398]  And then when somebody came in the middle of their group, who is an agent provocateur, who has a lifelong history of being a provocateur, that's what he does, he's a lefty protest provocateur, people like Clay Travis were right away saying,
[01:21:54.938 --> 01:21:54.998]  No.
[01:22:09.855 --> 01:22:10.135]  I think?
[01:22:30.914 --> 01:22:37.002]  Students who are part of the Covington group they were doing against Native Americans who are in the area They were doing it against white kids there.
[01:22:37.002 --> 01:22:48.436]  It didn't matter what race or ethnicity you were they were chanting some crazy racial slur So he was propagating and helping to instigate and further it and when the Black Hebrews lights were unsuccessful creating a viral video
[01:22:48.636 --> 01:22:50.437]  Because the kids moved away 50 yards.
[01:22:50.437 --> 01:22:50.798]  Exactly.
[01:22:50.798 --> 01:22:55.040]  They move back, they move internal, they look at each other, and they start doing chants.
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:59.924]  And so all of a sudden their whole scandal, their intended viral video, is completely falling apart.
[01:22:59.924 --> 01:23:04.887]  Their whole plan on attacking these kids and what those kids represent is falling apart.
[01:23:04.887 --> 01:23:07.629]  And look, even the Native Americans can't help but dance with the kids.
[01:23:07.629 --> 01:23:12.212]  Even though they're trying to start a fight with them, the whole tribal of humans coming together, they can't help themselves.
[01:23:12.392 --> 01:23:12.812]  Exactly.
[01:23:12.812 --> 01:23:16.213]  Often when they're laughing, they're laughing at their own inability to dance.
[01:23:16.213 --> 01:23:16.813]  That's what you can tell.
[01:23:16.813 --> 01:23:22.135]  Like, one of them's trying to do something, and he's laughing at his own failure to be able to dance as well as the people around him.
[01:23:22.135 --> 01:23:23.475]  So the media then tries to spin this.
[01:23:23.475 --> 01:23:34.338]  And one thing about you is, you're a real civil rights lawyer that's actually gone out and fought some of the, you know, rare, but they do exist, white supremacist-type groups and represented a lot of people dealing with that.
[01:23:34.338 --> 01:23:36.338]  But you're like the old-fashioned Southern lawyer.
[01:23:36.338 --> 01:23:37.899]  You're going to see, folks who don't know,
[01:23:38.379 --> 01:23:47.573]  Who actually stood up for everybody like an Atticus Finch or something instead of the left now just adopting all the old racial tactics because that they think is going to work with people.
[01:23:47.573 --> 01:23:53.241]  And so last night you were breaking down like Black Lives Matter how they always choose a bad case to actually create division.
[01:23:53.241 --> 01:23:53.882]  They know what they're doing.
[01:23:54.122 --> 01:23:54.742]  Absolutely.
[01:23:54.742 --> 01:23:59.245]  So I represent someone who died in custody in Milwaukee Jail.
[01:23:59.245 --> 01:24:00.967]  In the state of Perry, James Perry.
[01:24:00.967 --> 01:24:03.648]  They treated him like he was just a garbage bag.
[01:24:03.648 --> 01:24:08.532]  And he died, I mean he had epilepsy, he had diabetes that was untreated.
[01:24:08.532 --> 01:24:09.332]  They weren't treating it.
[01:24:09.332 --> 01:24:10.593]  He told them about this.
[01:24:10.593 --> 01:24:13.395]  They ended up, here he is, he has these things coming from his mouth.
[01:24:13.395 --> 01:24:14.476]  They spit mask him.
[01:24:14.476 --> 01:24:17.918]  They basically tie him up and throw him inside.
[01:24:17.918 --> 01:24:20.340]  And guys, let's humanize him.
[01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:22.421]  James Perry died in Milwaukee.
[01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:23.922]  We can pull up an image or some news articles.
[01:24:24.162 --> 01:24:24.642]  Sure.
[01:24:24.642 --> 01:24:25.903]  So this is a nice guy.
[01:24:25.903 --> 01:24:27.143]  This is a guy who has a family.
[01:24:27.143 --> 01:24:29.624]  He has a young child.
[01:24:29.624 --> 01:24:30.284]  He made a mistake.
[01:24:30.284 --> 01:24:32.124]  He was in jail, but he hadn't been convicted of anything.
[01:24:32.124 --> 01:24:33.705]  He hadn't been convicted of any crime.
[01:24:33.705 --> 01:24:36.586]  He was simply in jail awaiting his arraignment.
[01:24:36.586 --> 01:24:40.407]  He tells them up front, by the way, I have these untreated medical conditions.
[01:24:40.407 --> 01:24:42.747]  They do nothing to treat those medical conditions.
[01:24:42.747 --> 01:24:43.828]  He ends up being treated.
[01:24:43.828 --> 01:24:48.509]  In fact, well, one of the police officers tells him, if you're going to act like an animal, I'm going to treat you like an animal.
[01:24:48.829 --> 01:24:50.590]  He was urinating on himself.
[01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:52.470]  He was defecating on himself.
[01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:54.031]  And they were giving him no treatment.
[01:24:54.031 --> 01:24:55.592]  They left him in isolation.
[01:24:55.592 --> 01:25:00.133]  Then they let him die right in front of him on the medical room floor.
[01:25:00.133 --> 01:25:01.434]  And so I bring that suit.
[01:25:01.434 --> 01:25:05.675]  Can't get the groups like Black Lives Matter or other politicized groups like that to even be involved.
[01:25:05.675 --> 01:25:06.436]  They won't be engaged.
[01:25:06.436 --> 01:25:07.316]  They won't support it.
[01:25:07.316 --> 01:25:09.657]  Instead, they pick cases that look like a caricature
[01:25:10.197 --> 01:25:10.657]  We're good to go.
[01:25:33.285 --> 01:25:36.368]  They're not there when it's cut and dry because a black guy with diabetes having convulsions
[01:25:53.573 --> 01:25:58.516]  Being allowed to die by cynical people, we're all going to come together and say that's wrong and repudiate it.
[01:25:58.516 --> 01:26:14.425]  But if it's a big black guy with a big criminal record charging cops trying to attack him, and all the witnesses say he was attacking him, well just say that he didn't attack him because that'll make whites think it's unreasonable, and then a lot of black folks will still buy into it, and now you have real division, and now you keep it going forever.
[01:26:14.665 --> 01:26:15.085]  Precisely.
[01:26:15.085 --> 01:26:19.429]  I mean, they've actually made civil rights cases harder for all of the civil rights lawyers in the country to bring.
[01:26:19.429 --> 01:26:26.035]  Because now, more and more Republicans and more and more conservatives think that if you're bringing an allegation, that the allegation is likely false.
[01:26:26.035 --> 01:26:28.137]  When the allegation is likely true.
[01:26:28.137 --> 01:26:35.923]  But because they have discredited the civil rights movement by politicizing it and bringing the worst cases to public light, bringing the least credible cases.
[01:26:35.923 --> 01:26:39.226]  I mean, there's a reason why the NAACP picked Rosa Parks.
[01:26:39.226 --> 01:26:42.169]  They didn't pick, like, the drunk bum who was harassing people on the bus.
[01:26:42.509 --> 01:26:47.713]  They picked Rosa Parks because that united... She'd been at work all day, she was tired, she didn't have a criminal record.
[01:26:47.713 --> 01:26:48.914]  A pure great American.
[01:26:48.914 --> 01:26:53.657]  It recognized that Americanism transcends race, transcends religion, transcends politics.
[01:26:53.657 --> 01:26:54.758]  That's what they don't want.
[01:26:54.758 --> 01:26:58.861]  Because they want divisiveness, they want divide, they want conflict, they want confrontation.
[01:26:59.301 --> 01:27:11.855]  Also, if you're the Democratic Party and you fail to deliver for the African American community going on almost 50 years now, then you're in a political position where you have to keep getting people to vote for you without actually delivering any substantive material benefit.
[01:27:11.855 --> 01:27:15.218]  So instead you're just going to protect them from the bloodthirsty cops that are trying to kill you?
[01:27:15.819 --> 01:27:18.460]  But then there's only maybe a few hundred people innocent a year that get shot.
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:20.441]  It's still a problem if you're the person happening.
[01:27:20.441 --> 01:27:25.083]  But it becomes this giant diversion from thousands dead a year in Chicago at each other's hands.
[01:27:25.083 --> 01:27:25.523]  Precisely.
[01:27:25.523 --> 01:27:26.484]  You need a solution.
[01:27:26.484 --> 01:27:28.485]  You need a problem that you have no solution for.
[01:27:28.485 --> 01:27:31.686]  Because the moment there's a solution, then that takes the entire thing all apart.
[01:27:31.926 --> 01:27:32.967]  And by the way, people figured this out.
[01:27:53.129 --> 01:27:54.469]  But it's in the WikiLeaks!
[01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:59.891]  Hillary with top psychology professors going, well, we've been using culture war and racial division.
[01:27:59.891 --> 01:28:02.151]  We suggest we turn the heat up.
[01:28:02.151 --> 01:28:04.171]  And they're in the emails going, how do we turn it up?
[01:28:04.171 --> 01:28:05.792]  Well, you've seen that the last three years.
[01:28:05.792 --> 01:28:06.972]  They have turned it up.
[01:28:06.972 --> 01:28:07.412]  Precisely.
[01:28:07.412 --> 01:28:15.534]  It's not a coincidence that Black Lives Matter all of a sudden appears on the scene around the same time President Obama is failing to deliver material benefits to the African-American community.
[01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:18.696]  And it's not a coincidence it suddenly disappears once the election is gone.
[01:28:18.696 --> 01:28:22.118]  We've heard very little from them politically for quite a long time.
[01:28:22.118 --> 01:28:26.922]  So this is entirely politically manipulated, not designed... They're designed to suck the oxygen out of the room.
[01:28:26.922 --> 01:28:27.502]  Precisely.
[01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:38.790]  They're designed to increase divisiveness, because as long as people hate each other, they can't unite against their real adversary, which is the institutional, corporate, political structure that suppresses their rights and represses their economic opportunity.
[01:28:39.210 --> 01:28:41.853]  And because even in the power structure, there are reformers.
[01:28:41.853 --> 01:28:44.597]  By having this big fight, it just diverts it away from reform.
[01:28:44.597 --> 01:28:45.077]  Precisely.
[01:28:45.077 --> 01:28:45.618]  That's the whole goal.
[01:28:45.618 --> 01:28:46.339]  That's the whole objective.
[01:28:46.339 --> 01:28:47.420]  Stop reform.
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:49.122]  And Trump, I would say, has been trying to reform.
[01:28:49.122 --> 01:28:51.324]  Doesn't mean he's got it all done, but he's a reformer.
[01:28:51.324 --> 01:28:52.286]  Absolutely.
[01:28:52.286 --> 01:28:52.866]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:52.866 --> 01:28:53.267]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.421 --> 01:28:58.642]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.642 --> 01:29:02.564]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.564 --> 01:29:04.105]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:04.105 --> 01:29:07.066]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.066 --> 01:29:12.269]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:12.609 --> 01:29:13.811]  I can help you too.
[01:29:13.811 --> 01:29:16.754]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:16.754 --> 01:29:18.976]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:18.976 --> 01:29:23.421]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:23.421 --> 01:29:25.764]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:27.466 --> 01:29:30.888]  You know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:30.888 --> 01:29:35.871]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:35.871 --> 01:29:40.694]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:40.694 --> 01:29:42.055]  Don't just take my word for it.

[01:29:47.178 --> 01:29:47.739]  HBExtract.com.
[01:29:47.739 --> 01:29:50.520]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:59.895 --> 01:30:05.539]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[01:30:05.539 --> 01:30:08.660]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:11.342]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[01:30:11.342 --> 01:30:15.625]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[01:30:15.625 --> 01:30:22.989]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[01:30:22.989 --> 01:30:25.551]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[01:30:28.988 --> 01:30:30.829]  We have seen what they want to do.
[01:30:30.829 --> 01:30:31.630]  They called it U.N.
[01:30:31.630 --> 01:30:33.952]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[01:30:33.952 --> 01:30:34.632]  2030 Agenda.
[01:30:34.632 --> 01:30:46.161]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[01:30:46.161 --> 01:30:48.423]  It's the David Knight Show!
[01:30:48.423 --> 01:30:50.925]  Never miss your show, any day.
[01:30:50.925 --> 01:30:51.945]  I mean, what?
[01:30:51.945 --> 01:30:52.746]  I mean, never!
[01:31:00.905 --> 01:31:03.948]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:31:03.948 --> 01:31:10.393]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[01:31:10.393 --> 01:31:25.866]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[01:31:57.964 --> 01:32:00.205]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[01:32:00.205 --> 01:32:01.946]  There is no set stasis.
[01:32:01.946 --> 01:32:03.187]  There is no managed system.
[01:32:03.187 --> 01:32:04.848]  There is no un-continuum.
[01:32:04.848 --> 01:32:08.070]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:11.432]  So, you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[01:32:11.432 --> 01:32:12.653]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[01:32:12.653 --> 01:32:13.473]  We'll be here forever.
[01:32:13.473 --> 01:32:14.714]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[01:32:14.714 --> 01:32:21.598]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[01:32:21.598 --> 01:32:22.158]  We made it.
[01:32:22.158 --> 01:32:24.320]  And that's really where this goes.
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:26.141]  God's got a big war for you, Revy.
[01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:26.501]  And so,
[01:32:26.721 --> 01:32:33.168]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[01:32:33.168 --> 01:32:38.233]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[01:32:38.233 --> 01:32:41.096]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[01:32:41.096 --> 01:32:43.318]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[01:32:43.318 --> 01:32:47.002]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[01:32:47.002 --> 01:32:48.043]  I want to go to the next level.
[01:32:48.283 --> 01:32:51.407]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[01:32:51.407 --> 01:32:52.549]  Not these devil worshippers.
[01:32:52.549 --> 01:32:55.252]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[01:32:55.252 --> 01:32:56.514]  I want life!
[01:32:56.514 --> 01:33:01.320]  I want Jesus!
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.963]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:15.931 --> 01:33:25.896]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:25.896 --> 01:33:33.619]  We've got an intrepid reporter and patriot there at the Kentucky Catholic High School.
[01:33:33.619 --> 01:33:37.621]  We'll be going to Stuart Rhodes here of Oath Keepers in just a moment.
[01:33:37.621 --> 01:33:41.603]  And since I mentioned it, here is Bill Maher.
[01:33:43.032 --> 01:33:48.015]  Blaming the young people a week after it was admitted that they didn't start the argument, they did nothing wrong.
[01:33:48.015 --> 01:33:50.657]  Still blaming them and then making a pedophilic joke.
[01:33:50.657 --> 01:33:51.037]  Here it is.
[01:33:52.176 --> 01:34:00.219]  But the black Hebrews started to mix it up with these Catholic high school kids who were there from Kentucky?
[01:34:00.219 --> 01:34:00.680]  Right.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:01.760]  Okay.
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:10.824]  And they were there with a big pro-life barge, and then a Native American elder playing a drum got in the middle to mediate!
[01:34:10.824 --> 01:34:16.346]  And now it's a big thing, and you know, people saying the kid... I don't blame the kid, the smirking kid.
[01:34:16.346 --> 01:34:17.487]  I blame lead poisoning.
[01:34:19.653 --> 01:34:21.016]  And bad parenting.
[01:34:21.016 --> 01:34:23.181]  And oh yeah, I blame that f***ing kid.
[01:34:23.181 --> 01:34:25.766]  What a little prick.
[01:34:25.766 --> 01:34:27.310]  Smirk face.
[01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:28.212]  Smirk faces.
[01:34:28.212 --> 01:34:28.492]  Please.
[01:34:31.414 --> 01:34:42.338]  Like, that's not a dick move at any age to stick your face in this elderly man's... And this smirking kid says he was just trying to diffuse the situation by... Really?
[01:34:42.338 --> 01:34:42.718]  You know what?
[01:34:42.718 --> 01:34:48.500]  Next time you get into a fight with your wife, or your husband, or your boyfriend, or your girlfriend, uh, try that.
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:55.343]  Try... Try getting two inches from their face with a shit-eating grin and see if it diffuses the situation.
[01:35:02.674 --> 01:35:06.398]  He asked me if this kid should have done what everyone does during a drum solo.
[01:35:06.398 --> 01:35:10.642]  Leave.
[01:35:10.642 --> 01:35:16.368]  But... Really, I mean, I don't spend a lot of time, I must tell you, around Catholic school children.
[01:35:16.368 --> 01:35:22.515]  But I do not get what Catholic priests see in these kids.
[01:35:27.715 --> 01:35:36.506]  We know what you get the name of your production company is kid love and we have clips of you saying that 12 year olds be able to have sex with 35 year olds because it's just love the actual
[01:35:38.664 --> 01:35:41.925]  Slogan of Nambla, but that's a side issue.
[01:35:41.925 --> 01:35:48.508]  We have Robert Barnes, lawyer for some of the young people who first started the ball rolling pro bono here in studio with us.
[01:35:48.508 --> 01:35:52.650]  And we also have Stuart Rhodes at the scene there at Covington High School in Kentucky.
[01:35:52.650 --> 01:35:55.852]  He's running an operation, founder of Oath Keepers, pops in with us.
[01:35:55.852 --> 01:35:58.173]  Robert, pop in anytime as well here.
[01:35:58.173 --> 01:36:05.056]  But you've got a press release out on this, a call to action, standing up for the students of Covington High because
[01:36:06.318 --> 01:36:09.489]  Here we are two weeks later, they're still putting out this info attacking him.
[01:36:11.297 --> 01:36:11.958]  Absolutely.
[01:36:11.958 --> 01:36:15.300]  We have yet to have some enforcement in place.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:32.215]  Homeland Security here, as well as law enforcement, because of the nationwide libel and slander against these students that has caused terrorists from the political left to jump on them and for the first time in our nation's recent history, threaten children with death.
[01:36:32.215 --> 01:36:33.716]  It's just disturbing and disgusting.
[01:36:33.716 --> 01:36:39.041]  And so we're here to offer our protection to the students going to and from school and if they need it, at their homes.
[01:36:39.844 --> 01:36:40.705]  Well, that's great.
[01:36:40.705 --> 01:36:42.646]  And I want to get your report more on that.
[01:36:42.646 --> 01:36:44.027]  There's really high wind there, Stewart.
[01:36:44.027 --> 01:36:48.209]  If you can jump in your truck or your car, we'll come right back to you at the next segment.
[01:36:48.209 --> 01:36:51.571]  But I want people to be able to hear exactly what you say.
[01:36:51.571 --> 01:36:52.132]  Robert Barnes.
[01:36:53.962 --> 01:37:05.330]  Again, this case is super important because it illustrates the entire spectrum of disinformation and a corporate press ready to join together in fraud and it shows who their enemy is.
[01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:09.913]  Independent little islands that haven't fallen to Hollywood's control.
[01:37:09.913 --> 01:37:11.674]  What comes next and what do you make of Bill Maher?
[01:37:12.315 --> 01:37:22.484]  I mean, I think Bill Maher's biggest mistake was, even though he's a comedian, he's on live TV, so verbal slander is treated differently than written slander in Kentucky.
[01:37:22.484 --> 01:37:31.292]  So he's on a little bit safer legal grounds, and because he's a comedian, and he has a history of saying crazy things in general, he has a certain flexibility with what he says.
[01:37:31.292 --> 01:37:33.875]  His mistake here was being so specific about a fact.
[01:37:34.335 --> 01:37:38.617]  When he said, this kid got into the native elder's face.
[01:37:38.617 --> 01:37:50.723]  So, Mr. Sammons, represented by a very good lawyer out of Atlanta, Lynn Wood, who said he's now evaluating the Bill Maher statements, and I'm sure he will, and looking at it from a third-party perspective, that's a lie by Bill Maher.
[01:37:50.723 --> 01:37:53.924]  And it's a very simple lie, because the kid didn't get into anybody's face.
[01:37:53.924 --> 01:37:57.186]  And it's a lie once the ultimatum's already out there that we're watching you.
[01:37:57.546 --> 01:37:58.327]  Absolutely.
[01:37:58.327 --> 01:37:59.788]  So he knew it was a lie.
[01:37:59.788 --> 01:38:01.109]  He just repeats the lie.
[01:38:01.109 --> 01:38:09.635]  How would Bill Maher like it if somebody kept going up into his face and following him around everywhere and putting a drum in his face and beating the drum in his face?
[01:38:09.635 --> 01:38:12.577]  Bill Maher, I've seen how he's reacted in other situations.
[01:38:12.577 --> 01:38:13.358]  He's run at them.
[01:38:13.358 --> 01:38:14.799]  He's run after them.
[01:38:14.799 --> 01:38:15.780]  He's attacked them.
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:16.800]  That's been his reaction.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.962]  So for him to sit there and attack some kid, he's
[01:38:19.002 --> 01:38:24.105]  He still doesn't know, based on a video he didn't obviously read, or if he did, he's just lying about it.
[01:38:24.105 --> 01:38:28.107]  He either didn't watch it, didn't review it, didn't read what happened, or he's simply lying about it.
[01:38:28.107 --> 01:38:34.471]  Either way, he's making a false statement about a kid that's verifiably false that has subjected him to potential litigation.
[01:38:35.131 --> 01:38:39.533]  And they've already had to shut down the school, they've gotten bomb threats, they've gotten death threats.
[01:38:39.533 --> 01:38:41.394]  Who are some of the other prime candidates for suits here?
[01:38:41.394 --> 01:38:47.216]  I know you don't want to give away your attack before it happens, but we've got Kathy Griffin, we've got others.
[01:38:47.216 --> 01:38:52.659]  I think Kathy Griffin is a guarantee to get sued, because she went out there and said, please dox these kids.
[01:38:52.659 --> 01:38:53.239]  Please dox them.
[01:38:53.419 --> 01:38:56.042]  I mean, frankly, I don't think that's ever happened before.
[01:38:56.042 --> 01:38:58.624]  Angie said, don't think they wouldn't do it to you.
[01:38:58.624 --> 01:38:59.325]  Exactly.
[01:38:59.325 --> 01:39:01.827]  These kids have no clue who Kathy Griffin is.
[01:39:01.827 --> 01:39:04.090]  So the idea that they would ever dox her is insane.
[01:39:04.090 --> 01:39:08.514]  But the fact that she would go out there and call for it, refuse to retract it, refuse to correct it.
[01:39:08.514 --> 01:39:13.159]  She did retract one offending tweet when I asked her to do so, but she didn't retract that tweet.
[01:39:13.159 --> 01:39:16.222]  So she's on pace to get sued unless she settles it within the next week.
[01:39:16.622 --> 01:39:35.279]  The same is true for Maggie Haberman, the lead reporter for the New York Times, who lied about these kids, misled the world about these kids, called for these kids to be expelled based on a video she had failed to properly vet and read and review, and even when she knew it was false, even when her own newspaper printed that her original version of the story was false, she has refused to correct her personal statement.
[01:39:35.279 --> 01:39:40.064]  So she's going to be subject to suit as the lead reporter, the lead White House reporter for the New York Times.
[01:39:40.885 --> 01:39:42.066]  In addition, there's going to be others.
[01:39:42.066 --> 01:39:56.305]  Matthew Dowd, who's a big commentator for ABC News, one of those sort of fake Republicans, originally from Austin, way back, his family's from Michigan, got his name to fame by working for the W campaign and then attacking W, got him on to ABC and now he's sort of their
[01:39:56.846 --> 01:40:02.490]  They're local fake Republican just like Ana Navarro who also lied about these kids and has refused to fully retract and correct.
[01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:04.311]  She's subject to potential suit.
[01:40:04.311 --> 01:40:07.353]  So there's a range of people that we put notice on.
[01:40:07.353 --> 01:40:10.115]  There's about a dozen other people that we've given notices to.
[01:40:10.115 --> 01:40:11.536]  And some of them have corrected.
[01:40:11.536 --> 01:40:12.436]  Many of them have not.
[01:40:12.436 --> 01:40:14.718]  And those that have not are subject to suit.
[01:40:14.718 --> 01:40:17.980]  And those suits will be filed over the next month if they don't settle.
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:24.865]  Do you think this is going to make NowThis and other groups that help stage these things a little more paranoid knowing that, hey, conservatives and others are ready to sue you?
[01:40:25.385 --> 01:40:25.905]  That's the goal.
[01:40:25.905 --> 01:40:40.774]  The objective is they are so accustomed to facing no consequence, no impact, no effect whatsoever to their reckless, rogue, lawless acts that they have grown too arrogant and they need to be brought back down to life, brought back down to reality of the situation.
[01:40:40.774 --> 01:40:41.074]  That's right.
[01:40:41.074 --> 01:40:42.355]  Let's go back to Stuart Rhodes.
[01:40:42.355 --> 01:40:48.358]  He's there at the high school with his big national group, Oath Keepers, a veteran patriot.
[01:40:48.358 --> 01:40:50.019]  Needs no introduction here.
[01:40:50.019 --> 01:40:51.961]  Again, because your audio was breaking up earlier.
[01:40:51.961 --> 01:40:54.202]  Recap why you're there and the operation you guys have launched.
[01:40:55.512 --> 01:40:59.933]  Well, yes, we're here to stand for the students and to stand against terrorism, basically.
[01:40:59.933 --> 01:41:05.174]  They have a right to free speech and assembly and association, and they should not be threatened with death.
[01:41:05.174 --> 01:41:14.156]  This is disturbing that we haven't talked about this in this country, that they have school children being threatened with being murdered because they dare to be pro-life or wear a MAGA hat on their head.
[01:41:14.156 --> 01:41:19.317]  And it's directly because of the slander and libel of the mass media in this country that this is happening.
[01:41:19.818 --> 01:41:21.159]  So, Mr. Barnes is correct.
[01:41:21.159 --> 01:41:23.982]  You need to be called out and held to account for it.
[01:41:23.982 --> 01:41:26.845]  And frankly, there should be prosecutions as well for terrorism.
[01:41:26.845 --> 01:41:27.946]  This is what this is.
[01:41:27.946 --> 01:41:35.173]  The use of force, the threatened use of force for political ends, which is exactly what Antifa has been doing for two years now, but now it's being applied to children.
[01:41:35.173 --> 01:41:35.674]  And frankly,
[01:41:36.147 --> 01:41:42.252]  It's at once no surprise because of the pattern of the left but also disturbing this is where we're at now in this country.
[01:41:42.252 --> 01:42:00.567]  We're going to come back next segment with both of you because I should also say you're not just a veteran everything else is a great patriot you're also a constitutional lawyer award-winning as well from some of the same universities as this guy so we get two constitutional lawyers take on this perspective about how crazy because conservatives and nationalists and patriots we're not drama queens but when you pull back
[01:42:01.127 --> 01:42:04.830]  These are high school and middle school students who are also there being debt-threatened.
[01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:08.854]  The media is ganging up on it, saying they still deserve it a week and a half later.
[01:42:08.854 --> 01:42:10.875]  That is sensational!
[01:42:10.875 --> 01:42:12.717]  That is sensational!
[01:42:12.717 --> 01:42:13.457]  No doubt about it.
[01:42:13.457 --> 01:42:14.318]  I mean, it's scandalous.
[01:42:14.318 --> 01:42:18.842]  I mean, what they did to these kids, what they're willing to do to your kids, to anybody else's kids.
[01:42:18.842 --> 01:42:20.944]  That's the frightening thing, and that's the real message here.
[01:42:20.944 --> 01:42:23.466]  The message is, we can destroy your kids' future.
[01:42:23.466 --> 01:42:24.647]  Everything about your kids' future.
[01:42:24.827 --> 01:42:34.189]  Not only can we make their life a living hell now with death threats and personal threats and the rest, we can jeopardize their college admissions, we can jeopardize their future employment, we can jeopardize everything about their future.
[01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:38.930]  They're telling you, you support Trump or make America great again, we're going to ruin your life.
[01:42:38.930 --> 01:42:41.591]  What a dangerous authoritarian group.
[01:42:41.591 --> 01:42:43.752]  Democrats in Congress say ban the MAGA hat.
[01:42:43.752 --> 01:42:45.272]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:45.272 --> 01:42:50.553]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, NewsWars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.

[01:42:59.969 --> 01:43:02.991]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.

[01:44:47.508 --> 01:44:53.671]  It's time to see what krill oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil, now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:57.808 --> 01:45:07.097]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:45:07.097 --> 01:45:09.960]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:16.006]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:45:16.667 --> 01:45:22.934]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:45:22.934 --> 01:45:29.240]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:36.167]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:45:37.308 --> 01:45:50.331]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:45:50.331 --> 01:45:54.572]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:45:54.572 --> 01:45:58.073]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[01:45:58.073 --> 01:46:01.134]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[01:46:01.134 --> 01:46:02.694]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:04.077 --> 01:46:07.018]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[01:46:07.018 --> 01:46:14.021]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron's supply, one of the top, most respected companies out there.

[01:46:51.682 --> 01:46:57.066]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:47:01.201 --> 01:47:09.207]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.207 --> 01:47:10.888]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:47:10.888 --> 01:47:13.930]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:25.629 --> 01:47:32.074]  We've got Constitutional Lawyer Robert Barnes here, and we've got a Constitutional Lawyer with us as well, Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers.
[01:47:32.074 --> 01:47:37.919]  He's on the ground at the Covington Catholic School there in Kentucky.
[01:47:37.919 --> 01:47:51.009]  And I was asking this question of Robert earlier, I want to ask you this, and then your article at OathKeepers.org goes through these new thought crimes of just standing your ground, smiling confidently is a new hate symbol.
[01:47:52.153 --> 01:47:53.174]  You're a constitutional lawyer.
[01:47:53.174 --> 01:47:54.054]  You're a father.
[01:47:54.054 --> 01:47:54.974]  You're a veteran.
[01:47:54.974 --> 01:47:56.375]  You've been around the block.
[01:47:56.375 --> 01:47:58.116]  You worked for Ron Paul.
[01:47:58.116 --> 01:48:00.057]  You've seen a few things.
[01:48:00.057 --> 01:48:08.901]  What is the vitriolic, foaming-at-the-mouth hatred coming out of the left and the branding of anybody white as bad?
[01:48:08.901 --> 01:48:12.202]  I mean, it's just so crazy out of the left.
[01:48:12.202 --> 01:48:15.064]  What do you think their endgame is and why do you think they're doing it, Stuart?
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:21.624]  Well, they're making Orwell's 1984 an actual reality, rather than a warning of what not to do.
[01:48:21.624 --> 01:48:24.366]  They're using it as a manual, ironically.
[01:48:24.366 --> 01:48:29.430]  It's face crime, it's thought crime, and now you can call it hat crime.
[01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:31.131]  Not a hate crime, but a hat crime.
[01:48:31.131 --> 01:48:32.572]  Wearing the wrong hat.
[01:48:32.572 --> 01:48:34.774]  And they want to criminalize
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:41.906]  All of these things they consider to be unacceptable and outside of their worldview.
[01:48:41.906 --> 01:48:44.728]  They want to demonize it and criminalize it.
[01:48:44.728 --> 01:48:47.130]  If they could do it through the state, they will do that.
[01:48:47.130 --> 01:48:52.795]  But if they can't do it through the state, they'll do it through private violence, through Antifa and other terrorist organizations like that.
[01:48:52.795 --> 01:49:00.302]  But their end goal is to really actualize Orwell's 1984 and make anybody who is not them the enemy.
[01:49:00.302 --> 01:49:01.583]  I mean, Trump is Goldstein.
[01:49:02.143 --> 01:49:14.394]  And all of us who are Trump supporters, or anybody who wears a MAGA hat, even if they just bought it that day, is considered to be Goldstein's followers who must be demonized and hated and smashed and crushed and burned alive.
[01:49:14.394 --> 01:49:15.555]  That's right, the ten minutes of hate.
[01:49:15.555 --> 01:49:16.456]  In fact, can we pull it up?
[01:49:16.456 --> 01:49:18.598]  I forgot to tell you guys.
[01:49:18.598 --> 01:49:25.805]  In Arizona, in a restaurant about blue-collar workers, they have a picture of coal miners coming out of the mine and drinking beer.
[01:49:26.943 --> 01:49:28.804]  Which you have blackface once you do it.
[01:49:28.804 --> 01:49:29.744]  That's what coal miners look like.
[01:49:29.744 --> 01:49:31.124]  They also get black lung.
[01:49:31.124 --> 01:49:33.325]  They go, oh, we want this down.
[01:49:33.325 --> 01:49:34.185]  This is racist.
[01:49:34.185 --> 01:49:39.867]  So everything is projected onto this and it just gets crazier.
[01:49:39.867 --> 01:49:42.427]  Meanwhile, all of us are losing our privacy rights.
[01:49:42.427 --> 01:49:43.988]  We're losing the right of our sovereignty.
[01:49:43.988 --> 01:49:46.748]  We're losing all of these things.
[01:49:46.748 --> 01:49:49.369]  That's up on newswars.com.
[01:49:49.369 --> 01:49:52.470]  What do you think the controlled corporate left is trying to do here, Robert Barnes?
[01:49:52.950 --> 01:50:01.597]  I think it's, well my 21-year-old son put it well, and he's not even very political, he's not like a conservative or libertarian or an activist at all, he's just a gamer.
[01:50:01.597 --> 01:50:09.363]  And he said, I think the world is telling me after he saw the Covington story, I'm supposed to feel bad just because of the color of my skin and the gender I was born with.
[01:50:09.363 --> 01:50:10.563]  And that's been the message.
[01:50:10.563 --> 01:50:12.385]  The message is feel bad for who you are.
[01:50:12.925 --> 01:50:15.328]  It's like a bad version of a Tom Wolfe novel.
[01:50:15.328 --> 01:50:17.189]  It's like Tom Wolfe on LSD.
[01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:19.451]  And it's the insanity of it.
[01:50:19.451 --> 01:50:22.334]  And the message is you cannot be yourself, you can't trust yourself.
[01:50:22.334 --> 01:50:25.117]  It's to destroy and to wreck and obliterate the past.
[01:50:25.117 --> 01:50:26.558]  To kill male confidence.
[01:50:26.558 --> 01:50:27.979]  Absolutely.
[01:50:27.979 --> 01:50:36.848]  Because this has been one of the last places disproportionately white men politically are advocating for traditional causes and traditional ideas and various forms of the political
[01:50:37.228 --> 01:50:38.089]  Atmosphere.
[01:50:38.089 --> 01:50:39.329]  So they see that as a threat.
[01:50:39.329 --> 01:50:41.130]  So how do you demonize that threat?
[01:50:41.130 --> 01:50:42.671]  When you can't debate the ideas.
[01:50:42.671 --> 01:50:44.512]  When you can't debate Jordan Peterson.
[01:50:44.512 --> 01:50:45.913]  You can't debate Stefan Molyneux.
[01:50:45.913 --> 01:50:47.413]  You can't debate Mike Cernovich.
[01:50:47.413 --> 01:50:47.894]  What do you do?
[01:50:47.894 --> 01:50:51.015]  You demonize them simply because of the color of their skin and their gender.
[01:50:51.015 --> 01:50:54.197]  And it's so ironic because it's exactly against what King taught.
[01:50:54.197 --> 01:51:00.060]  King's home, one of the greatest Americans in American history, political history, social history, is Martin Luther King.
[01:51:00.060 --> 01:51:02.121]  And what he taught was not... Because he tapped into Americana.
[01:51:02.481 --> 01:51:03.262]  Absolutely.
[01:51:03.262 --> 01:51:12.949]  He said, let's judge our whole dream, our whole ideal, our whole democratic structure is built on the presumption that we will recognize people for the content of their character, not the color of their skin.
[01:51:12.949 --> 01:51:16.011]  As a little kid, I had all those little cassette tapes.
[01:51:16.011 --> 01:51:17.832]  I had all of his speeches, all of his sermons.
[01:51:17.832 --> 01:51:19.113]  I used to listen to him all the time.
[01:51:19.113 --> 01:51:23.296]  Saved up what little money I had just so I could listen to them as a kid, as a 12, 13, 14 year old.
[01:51:23.296 --> 01:51:27.880]  And what the left is doing is demonizing his legacy, destroying his legacy.
[01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:29.481]  Well, have you heard universities are actually taking his
[01:51:29.721 --> 01:51:30.222]  I don't know.
[01:51:46.658 --> 01:51:55.523]  Christian Renaissance Movement, the Enlightenment, what the abolitionists had done to try to speak to America's soul to do the right thing.
[01:51:55.523 --> 01:52:04.428]  And then the left betrayed that whole deal and is now juxtaposing, trying to turn the minorities into the very same paradigm we fought to reverse Stuart Rhodes.
[01:52:04.428 --> 01:52:05.148]  Absolutely.
[01:52:05.148 --> 01:52:08.810]  They are the ones who are racist and racially focused with identity politics.
[01:52:09.497 --> 01:52:17.603]  And as Mr. Barnes said, they're now attempting to demonize everyone with white skin as a political weapon against their political opponents.
[01:52:17.603 --> 01:52:22.827]  And of course, Thomas Sowell and other conservative black people don't get a pass either.
[01:52:22.827 --> 01:52:25.830]  They're considered Oreos and they're demonized as well.
[01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:34.837]  But it's all about identity politics as a weapon against the West and a weapon against our constitutional republic.
[01:52:34.837 --> 01:52:36.338]  What do you think is coming next, Stuart Rhodes?
[01:52:37.852 --> 01:52:38.593]  More violence.
[01:52:38.593 --> 01:52:43.657]  I expect the Weather Underground style attacks to be commencing soon.
[01:52:43.657 --> 01:52:46.900]  I think the left is eventually going to go fully kinetic and kill somebody.
[01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:48.641]  That's why we're here.
[01:52:48.641 --> 01:53:00.731]  I think the school is being secured now by Homeland Security and the local police pretty effectively, but we want to offer, we feel duty-bound to offer our protection to the students going to and from school and also their homes if they need it.
[01:53:00.731 --> 01:53:02.392]  And Mr. Barnes, same goes for you.
[01:53:02.392 --> 01:53:04.394]  I know you're under a bomb threat.
[01:53:04.394 --> 01:53:06.816]  We have members in California, retired cops there.
[01:53:07.216 --> 01:53:09.117]  We're willing to step up and protect you if you need it.
[01:53:23.906 --> 01:53:27.889]  Absolutely, and especially once the media starts to green light this kind of violence.
[01:53:27.889 --> 01:53:32.593]  That's why it's very problematic when people like Reza Aslan go out there and talk about punching him in the face.
[01:53:32.593 --> 01:53:35.895]  Very problematic when Kathy Griffin says, let's dox these kids.
[01:53:35.895 --> 01:53:38.097]  Very problematic when- She said, I'll give you sex!
[01:53:40.023 --> 01:53:41.524]  It's a classic thing, like a woman.
[01:53:41.524 --> 01:53:43.886]  You can have me if you go after that son of a bitch.
[01:53:43.886 --> 01:53:46.188]  I mean, that's like offering money on the table.
[01:53:46.188 --> 01:53:49.750]  Attractive woman, says I'll have sex with you, go out there and attack people.
[01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:55.314]  Well, I mean, that was a young, self-described Saturday Night Live writer who was saying those kind of comments.
[01:53:55.314 --> 01:53:56.174]  So that's terrifying.
[01:53:56.174 --> 01:53:59.277]  By the way, what would happen if somebody walked up and knocked her teeth out?
[01:53:59.277 --> 01:54:00.217]  I'm not saying do that.
[01:54:00.217 --> 01:54:01.858]  Oh, it'd be a woman's attack?
[01:54:01.858 --> 01:54:02.399]  It's horrible.
[01:54:02.399 --> 01:54:03.219]  The media would ignore it.
[01:54:03.219 --> 01:54:03.900]  She called for it.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:07.682]  So under common law, under common sense, she's fair game.
[01:54:07.682 --> 01:54:10.904]  I'm not saying do it, but what would happen if somebody knocked her in the teeth?
[01:54:10.904 --> 01:54:12.645]  I think what they want is violent conflict.
[01:54:12.645 --> 01:54:19.990]  They want the excuse and the premise and the pretense to be able to demonize these groups, to be able to strip them of their liberty, strip them of their rights, strip them of the
[01:54:20.230 --> 01:54:27.094]  The audience is right to listen to whom they want, where they want, how they want, because their goal is mind control, thought control, idea control.
[01:54:27.094 --> 01:54:28.174]  You have to think like them.
[01:54:28.174 --> 01:54:31.276]  It's very much like the Inquisition era of the 15th century.
[01:54:31.276 --> 01:54:33.097]  They see any heretics as dangerous.
[01:54:33.097 --> 01:54:34.257]  They need to be burned at the stake.
[01:54:34.257 --> 01:54:36.158]  They need to be censored, shamed, and banished.
[01:54:36.158 --> 01:54:37.079]  They need to be isolated.
[01:54:37.079 --> 01:54:41.161]  They're building their own wall, and you can only think what those inside the wall say you can think.
[01:54:41.161 --> 01:54:43.162]  And if you don't, then you'll be banished or destroyed.
[01:54:43.442 --> 01:54:46.163]  And it's part of a pattern that's deeper and more pernicious.
[01:54:46.163 --> 01:54:56.747]  And it just reached out and everybody was shocked by it because they said, if they could do this to a bunch of kids, Catholic school kids, who are trying to do the best they can under difficult circumstances, then they can do it to anybody, anywhere, anytime.
[01:54:56.747 --> 01:54:57.368]  Well, that's right.
[01:54:57.368 --> 01:55:03.910]  Maybe we can pull up that famous Roman statesman quote, Cicero, about the enemy within being the plague.
[01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:06.491]  Because, Stuart, you're a historian, I'm just a constitutional lawyer, smart guy.
[01:55:06.491 --> 01:55:09.533]  In closing, how do we stop this?
[01:55:09.533 --> 01:55:12.014]  Because, clearly, America can only fall from within, but
[01:55:13.327 --> 01:55:24.781]  Our milk and honey has caused a lot of decadence and so we're getting soft, myself included, but we're still not against the country itself.
[01:55:24.781 --> 01:55:29.467]  How do we deal with a criminal cult that really means to take the country over?
[01:55:30.609 --> 01:55:31.190]  Stand up.
[01:55:31.190 --> 01:55:32.090]  Stand your ground.
[01:55:32.090 --> 01:55:35.233]  Do exactly what the students did, what Nick did, standing there that day.
[01:55:35.233 --> 01:55:37.435]  And then afterwards, he refused to apologize.
[01:55:37.435 --> 01:55:42.800]  It was an attempt to pressure him to give in and apologize for something he did not do.
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:44.381]  So stand your ground.
[01:55:44.381 --> 01:55:51.347]  Don't give them any benefit of credence for their position because their positions are bankrupt.
[01:55:52.133 --> 01:55:53.473]  Be Americans.
[01:55:53.473 --> 01:55:59.095]  Stand up and defend your right to free speech and assembly for all Americans, and be consistent about that.
[01:55:59.095 --> 01:56:01.475]  And don't buy into the threat.
[01:56:01.475 --> 01:56:04.156]  Don't counter them with also threatening them.
[01:56:04.156 --> 01:56:07.577]  Let them be the ones to show their true colors, which they are doing right now.
[01:56:07.577 --> 01:56:08.837]  That's all the more better.
[01:56:08.837 --> 01:56:14.819]  So, you know, light sunlight, bring attention to it, and stand your ground, and don't apologize for being Americans and being free.
[01:56:15.539 --> 01:56:16.860]  Alright Stuart Rhodes, I know you're up there.
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:18.221]  Let's talk to you tomorrow if you have time.
[01:56:18.221 --> 01:56:18.601]  God bless.
[01:56:18.601 --> 01:56:19.681]  We really appreciate you.
[01:56:19.681 --> 01:56:22.023]  Oathkeepers.org to see more of what you're doing.
[01:56:22.023 --> 01:56:22.863]  Thank you.
[01:56:22.863 --> 01:56:24.544]  I want to just be very clear about this when we come back.
[01:56:24.544 --> 01:56:25.265]  Briefly I'll talk about...
[01:56:26.067 --> 01:56:30.028]  Solutions here, but most times we go out to cover an event.
[01:56:30.028 --> 01:56:32.269]  There are no independent media there.
[01:56:32.269 --> 01:56:35.330]  That means just a person with a camera and a YouTube account.
[01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:44.012]  If you go to any leftist demonstration, you will see the most mentally ill, insane people, setting people up, doing incredibly insane things.
[01:56:44.012 --> 01:56:46.373]  And they may have a YouTube channel with 50 followers.
[01:56:46.373 --> 01:56:50.714]  It'll have 50,000 after you're done because that video will go viral.
[01:56:50.714 --> 01:56:52.615]  But most of the time, there's no one there to catch it.
[01:56:54.056 --> 01:56:59.979]  When these people try to set folks up, if there weren't other cameras there catching the setup, it wouldn't have happened.
[01:56:59.979 --> 01:57:10.364]  When we come back, I'll show Owen Schroeder, yesterday having a psychotic, actually attack him and eat his microphone, and then smell it, and then roll around on the ground like a demon.
[01:57:10.364 --> 01:57:14.246]  So, that footage is actually coming up, but this is Mass Mental Illness.
[01:57:14.246 --> 01:57:16.787]  Briefly, because I get so busy I don't plug.
[01:57:16.787 --> 01:57:18.028]  I'm our worst nightmare around here.
[01:57:19.108 --> 01:57:23.212]  Folks, we have great products, the very best out there, at Inforrestore.com.
[01:57:23.212 --> 01:57:24.833]  We have three big specials.
[01:57:24.833 --> 01:57:28.937]  Turmeric Bodies Ultimate Turmeric Formula, 50% off.
[01:57:28.937 --> 01:57:31.138]  Super Metal Super Female Vitality, amazing.
[01:57:31.138 --> 01:57:33.741]  Chamomile Bioenergy, 50% off.
[01:57:33.741 --> 01:57:38.164]  X3, all the good iodines, including the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, 50% off.
[01:57:38.164 --> 01:57:41.467]  That all ends this Friday, because some of those are about to sell out.
[01:57:41.467 --> 01:57:45.471]  And the new Turbo Force, beyond Next Level Energy Drink and more.
[01:57:49.983 --> 01:57:53.025]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:57:53.025 --> 01:57:59.450]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[01:57:59.450 --> 01:58:14.922]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[01:58:14.922 --> 01:58:18.665]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[01:58:20.481 --> 01:58:28.525]  With 14 servings per box for a two-week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[01:58:28.525 --> 01:58:34.928]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[01:58:34.928 --> 01:58:36.929]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[01:58:36.929 --> 01:58:39.491]  Perk up with TurboForce at infowarrestore.com.
[01:58:48.201 --> 01:58:52.137]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:58:53.484 --> 01:59:01.588]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:59:01.588 --> 01:59:04.149]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:07.611]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:59:07.611 --> 01:59:10.232]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:59:10.232 --> 01:59:12.513]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:59:12.513 --> 01:59:19.477]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:59:20.017 --> 01:59:29.805]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:59:29.805 --> 01:59:30.986]  We'll win.
[01:59:30.986 --> 01:59:33.889]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:59:33.889 --> 01:59:41.055]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:59:41.055 --> 01:59:44.738]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globus may win.
[01:59:44.738 --> 01:59:46.320]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:47.160]  We need your support.
[01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:47.721]  I'm counting on you.
[01:59:51.273 --> 01:59:53.903]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:23.931 --> 02:00:27.476]  Robert Barnes is a smart cookie.
[02:00:27.476 --> 02:00:30.059]  And I say that about a lot of folks, but I had dinner with him for two hours.
[02:00:30.059 --> 02:00:32.002]  I was familiar with his work over the years.
[02:00:32.002 --> 02:00:35.566]  Seen some of the big cases he's handled, most of them successfully.
[02:00:35.566 --> 02:00:35.767]  But...
[02:00:37.349 --> 02:00:49.392]  Talking to him, and he really has a big general knowledge of things, because most people have a specialized knowledge, and I think my knowledge isn't perfect or that great sometimes, but compared to other people, it's a general knowledge.
[02:00:49.392 --> 02:00:55.193]  And talking to you last night for two hours, just your general knowledge was right in line with mine, and then some very, very exciting.
[02:00:55.193 --> 02:00:57.694]  There's so much to cover this hour, but what do you want to get into?
[02:00:58.214 --> 02:01:07.078]  Well, I think part of the broader pattern, the broader aspect of what's taking place here is that the media is starting to green-lit violence and crazy minds.
[02:01:07.078 --> 02:01:23.926]  Because when you have New York Times writers, former CNN producers, major Hollywood celebrities saying that the effect of this is, it's okay to be violent, let's punch him in the face, it's such a punchable face, let's dox him, let's go after them, I'll provide sexual services if you go out and attack this person.
[02:01:24.326 --> 02:01:26.347]  They're telling, they're green-litting, they know what they're doing.
[02:01:26.347 --> 02:01:29.167]  They're green-litting the most craziest danger.
[02:01:29.167 --> 02:01:30.448]  And they're dehumanizing.
[02:01:30.448 --> 02:01:31.888]  Absolutely, that's the goal.
[02:01:31.888 --> 02:01:38.250]  It's like they're trying to recreate the 1930s, where in the 1930s Europe you had clashes on the streets between the communists and the fascists.
[02:01:38.250 --> 02:01:43.011]  They're trying to create a violent movement, they're trying to instigate that violent movement, they're trying to inspire that violent movement.
[02:01:43.391 --> 02:01:55.377]  And when you'll do it against kids, 12-year-old, 13-year-old kids, who have never been in the public light in their lives, whose only crime was showing up at Lincoln Memorial in a hat that simply said, Make America Great Again.
[02:01:55.377 --> 02:01:56.617]  That's it.
[02:01:56.617 --> 02:01:57.858]  And you say, oh, you know what?
[02:01:57.858 --> 02:01:59.739]  That's like the Klan outfit.
[02:01:59.739 --> 02:02:01.640]  That's like the Klan hood.
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:03.101]  What they're saying is, go out there and punch them.
[02:02:03.101 --> 02:02:03.901]  Go out there and attack them.
[02:02:04.161 --> 02:02:05.683]  Go out there and do something violent.
[02:02:05.683 --> 02:02:09.306]  Go and do what that man did to the Republicans at the softball field.
[02:02:09.306 --> 02:02:20.177]  They're green-lighting it, they're approving it, and the fact that they'll stand by it, even when it's exposed as a fraud, they'll stand by it, even when they know the threats of violence that are coming in, shows you just how dangerous this environment is.
[02:02:20.177 --> 02:02:24.401]  Oh yeah, put our Islamic member of Congress' tweet back up there.
[02:02:24.401 --> 02:02:25.702]  That's Omar Etch.
[02:02:26.952 --> 02:02:32.754]  Ilhan Omar, the boys were protesting a woman's right to choose and yell, it's not right if you enjoy it.
[02:02:32.754 --> 02:02:35.075]  That is such defamation, never said that.
[02:02:35.075 --> 02:02:40.297]  They were taunting five black men before they surrounded Phillips and led racist chants.
[02:02:40.297 --> 02:02:41.698]  This is a total inversion of reality.
[02:02:42.938 --> 02:02:48.079]  Sandman's family hired a right-wing PR firm to write his non-apology.
[02:02:48.079 --> 02:02:49.299]  None of that's true.
[02:02:49.299 --> 02:02:49.619]  Exactly.
[02:02:49.619 --> 02:02:50.559]  All of it were lies.
[02:02:50.559 --> 02:02:52.340]  And I'll give the Congresswoman credit.
[02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:56.881]  Within one hour of me telling her that she needed to retract that or be sued, she did.
[02:02:56.881 --> 02:02:59.921]  But it's one of the only offending things that she's ever retracted.
[02:02:59.921 --> 02:03:02.942]  One of the only horrible statements that she's ever pulled back.
[02:03:02.942 --> 02:03:03.922]  But all of those were lies.
[02:03:03.922 --> 02:03:05.022]  And they knew they were lies.
[02:03:05.022 --> 02:03:10.303]  And the fact that you have Senator Warren, she's likely to be sued next week unless she takes down her offending... Elizabeth Warren.
[02:03:11.303 --> 02:03:14.165]  So you have a fake Indian spreading fake news.
[02:03:14.165 --> 02:03:21.291]  And the nature of that, here you have a senator who's one of the leading Democratic candidates for the presidency of the United States.
[02:03:21.291 --> 02:03:27.495]  And yet she's out there defaming kids she's never met based on a video either she didn't review or she lied about reviewing.
[02:03:27.495 --> 02:03:33.620]  And even when she knew it was false, even when she knew the story was false, she continued to propagate it, continued to perpetuate it.
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:36.821]  Congresswoman Howland did the same thing, out of New Mexico.
[02:03:36.821 --> 02:03:38.742]  By the way, let's be straight on this.
[02:03:38.742 --> 02:03:43.305]  You never planned to sue the diocese or others that got on the bandwagon.
[02:03:43.305 --> 02:03:47.046]  That was another hoax put up by the media to drive a wedge between you and the families.
[02:03:47.046 --> 02:03:47.567]  Precisely.
[02:03:47.567 --> 02:03:53.810]  There was a story spread that I was going to sue the local priest, I was going to sue the local school system, I was going to sue the diocese.
[02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:55.411]  I was never going to do any of those things.
[02:03:55.411 --> 02:03:56.671]  And the parents weren't interested in that.
[02:03:56.671 --> 02:03:59.372]  The parents were interested in preserving and protecting their reputation.
[02:03:59.372 --> 02:04:02.414]  They just wanted apologies so the death threats would stop.
[02:04:02.694 --> 02:04:03.275]  Oh, precisely.
[02:04:03.275 --> 02:04:03.555]  Exactly.
[02:04:03.555 --> 02:04:04.115]  That was it.
[02:04:04.115 --> 02:04:06.257]  They just want people to go back to normal.
[02:04:06.257 --> 02:04:07.978]  To go back to where it was a week before.
[02:04:07.978 --> 02:04:10.120]  They knew they never could completely restore that.
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:11.641]  But they just wanted to protect their children.
[02:04:11.641 --> 02:04:12.861]  Protect their children's lives.
[02:04:12.861 --> 02:04:13.982]  Protect their children's future.
[02:04:13.982 --> 02:04:14.703]  That's it.
[02:04:14.703 --> 02:04:15.964]  They wanted nothing more than that.
[02:04:15.964 --> 02:04:17.085]  Nothing beyond that.
[02:04:17.085 --> 02:04:18.466]  They weren't here to make a political statement.
[02:04:18.466 --> 02:04:23.589]  So what's happened is the left has infiltrated the main Vatican with all their pedophiles to try to bring it down.
[02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:26.732]  There's still all these little independent Catholic groups that are wholesome and good.
[02:04:26.732 --> 02:04:28.953]  And the left is pissed they can't get control of that.
[02:04:28.953 --> 02:04:29.393]  Absolutely.
[02:04:29.393 --> 02:04:30.014]  That's exactly right.
[02:04:30.274 --> 02:04:41.941]  It's very much that these are people who have their own independent narrative, their own independent story, their own independent understanding of the world, and they hate... And they're strong, and they're moral, and they're controlled, and that is everything the establishment doesn't like.
[02:04:41.941 --> 02:04:43.021]  They're independent.
[02:04:43.021 --> 02:04:43.882]  They're not weak.
[02:04:43.882 --> 02:04:44.903]  Exactly.
[02:04:44.903 --> 02:04:46.904]  And that's exactly what they're most threatened by.
[02:04:46.904 --> 02:04:48.425]  That's why they're threatening it.
[02:04:48.425 --> 02:04:51.026]  They're afraid of just decency.
[02:04:51.026 --> 02:04:51.586]  We'll be back.
[02:04:51.586 --> 02:04:53.407]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com.

[02:06:11.716 --> 02:06:12.818]  InfoWars.
[02:06:12.818 --> 02:06:16.864]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[02:06:16.864 --> 02:06:21.812]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[02:06:21.812 --> 02:06:25.698]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:32.364 --> 02:06:40.327]  Coming to you live from the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[02:06:40.327 --> 02:06:44.709]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:47.030]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:50.552]  Turning for many of the Catholic school kids.
[02:06:50.552 --> 02:06:53.453]  The Covington in Kentucky is riding shotgun with us.
[02:06:54.802 --> 02:07:00.527]  And we are looking with Robert Barnes at the whole waterfront here and what's unfolding.
[02:07:00.527 --> 02:07:07.152]  I want to get to just one piece of footage that's gone viral on Infowars.com since last night.
[02:07:07.152 --> 02:07:16.600]  Millions of views on every platform out there with Owen Schroer is in DC covering the Roger Stone indictment and arraignment and hearings coming up.
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:20.423]  So he sees a protester group, the big giant rat on the back of a truck.
[02:07:20.423 --> 02:07:21.264]  You'll see the video in a moment.
[02:07:22.387 --> 02:07:40.158]  Uh, and so, uh, all that unfolded then was that, we'll see the video, he walks across the street, he's showing the rat, and the guy runs over, grabs his microphone, starts trying to eat the microphone cover, tries to put spit in his eyes, tries to spit on his camera, and it's just, look,
[02:07:41.462 --> 02:07:54.269]  The liberals I thought of 20-30 years ago were like lawyers that went out and, whether you were a poor white person or a poor black person, whatever, represented you if you got screwed over for pro bono, like Robert Barnes is famous for doing.
[02:07:54.269 --> 02:08:03.073]  But you look at weird academic leftists, man, they're all like escaped mental institutions wards.
[02:08:03.073 --> 02:08:06.175]  If you go out to these events, we're not just cherry-picking these people.
[02:08:06.795 --> 02:08:12.237]  There seems like there's something fundamentally wrong with them, and it's a malaise that's spreading.
[02:08:12.237 --> 02:08:15.639]  Now, Robert, obviously you won't agree with me if that's not your perception.
[02:08:15.639 --> 02:08:19.480]  What is your perception of what I just said, and what do you think this is?
[02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:23.922]  It's sort of a, you know, Jonathan Haidt, a very good professor, has described it as part of call-out culture.
[02:08:23.922 --> 02:08:26.663]  So what's happened is they've combined social media call-out culture
[02:08:27.063 --> 02:08:34.149]  In a degree to which a lot of children weren't allowed to play in the early 90s as the abduction stories became big stories.
[02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:36.531]  So parents told their kids not to go outside and play.
[02:08:36.531 --> 02:08:39.613]  And so they created this sort of safe space environment from the time they're young.
[02:08:39.613 --> 02:08:42.796]  And that's been reinforced by culture, reinforced now by university life.
[02:08:42.796 --> 02:08:50.082]  And what you have is you have these provocateurs and lefty protest culture who believe that the more insane they are, the more social prestige they're going to acquire.
[02:08:50.802 --> 02:09:02.312]  So it becomes, within their world, be nuttier, be crazier, be wackier, create more provocation, create more of a viral news story, no matter how fake it is, no matter how ludicrous it is, and that's what gets you brownie points and your little social milieu.
[02:09:02.312 --> 02:09:07.977]  And the effect of it is very dangerous to ordinary, innocent, everyday people who are just trying to exercise their civil rights and civil liberties.
[02:09:08.417 --> 02:09:14.004]  And it's become very precarious for people across the political spectrum, but particularly for people from the political right.
[02:09:14.004 --> 02:09:22.814]  Because they're the most often targeted by these lefty, violent protesters who often act in insane ways solely to provoke a reaction and a response.
[02:09:22.814 --> 02:09:25.978]  And here they just did it to ordinary everyday kids, but they do it to ordinary people all the time.
[02:09:26.198 --> 02:09:27.760]  They're not targeting people in power.
[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:28.941]  They're targeting ordinary people.
[02:09:28.941 --> 02:09:29.702]  They're bullish!
[02:09:29.702 --> 02:09:30.123]  Exactly.
[02:09:30.123 --> 02:09:31.164]  They're pure bullies.
[02:09:31.164 --> 02:09:38.513]  That's what I explained early on about what I learned about the Trump campaign when I was originally just monitoring for betting purposes and gambling purposes.
[02:09:38.513 --> 02:09:43.279]  I got in and started going to rallies and events and I realized that Trump wasn't the bully.
[02:09:43.279 --> 02:09:45.642]  He was the guy who was going to go up to the bully and punch the bully in the mouth.
[02:09:46.142 --> 02:09:51.126]  And that that's really what was happening because the left has become a bullying culture.
[02:09:51.126 --> 02:09:52.647]  It's intolerant across the board.
[02:09:52.647 --> 02:09:54.689]  It uses Twitter mobs to attack people.
[02:09:54.689 --> 02:09:57.732]  It uses literal mobs as what happened in Covington to attack people.
[02:09:57.732 --> 02:10:04.397]  And they always accuse us of being the bullies when they have organized scientific safe spaces for bullies to attack people.
[02:10:04.657 --> 02:10:06.358]  Absolutely, that's exactly what's going on.
[02:10:06.358 --> 02:10:09.681]  And the message has been to green light whatever activity they do.
[02:10:09.681 --> 02:10:14.465]  To green light the worst behavior, the most demonstrative behavior, the potentially most violent behavior.
[02:10:14.465 --> 02:10:22.371]  I mean, think, if those kids had been any other kind of kids, I mean, I knew folks I grew up with in Southeast Tennessee that would have reacted very differently to that kind of name-calling and that kind of attacking.
[02:10:22.591 --> 02:10:27.154]  They would have been a lot less generous, a lot less civil, a lot less of Christian character in their reaction.
[02:10:27.154 --> 02:10:31.036]  These kids reacted the best you could possibly imagine under those set of circumstances.
[02:10:31.036 --> 02:10:37.699]  And that's what made the establishment get even more pissed and spin it even worse, because it was that Jedi control they couldn't stand.
[02:10:37.699 --> 02:10:38.140]  Precisely.
[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:40.541]  The more innocent they were, the more they had to libel them.
[02:10:40.541 --> 02:10:42.522]  The more innocent they were, the more they had to lie about them.
[02:10:42.762 --> 02:10:45.364]  The more innocent they were, the more they had to destroy their reputation.
[02:10:45.364 --> 02:10:49.047]  And that also serves, ultimately, their political agenda and their political objectives.
[02:10:49.047 --> 02:10:57.954]  Because if they're able to so defame them and so destroy them when they are so innocent, then what can they do to an ordinary person anywhere in the walk of life who dares to voice a dissident view?
[02:11:02.694 --> 02:11:04.936]  To me, the left has no bottom now.
[02:11:04.936 --> 02:11:07.499]  And so the very worst of them becomes their new leader.
[02:11:07.499 --> 02:11:09.000]  And then somebody else will go even further.
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.684]  And so I think it's a radicalization curve.
[02:11:12.684 --> 02:11:13.145]  Absolutely.
[02:11:13.145 --> 02:11:15.667]  It's basically Gawker culture writ large.
[02:11:15.667 --> 02:11:23.255]  So you look at Gawker, and what got Gawker was you had reporters for Gawker in depositions say that it would have been okay to show a sex tape involving a five-year-old.
[02:11:24.375 --> 02:11:26.596]  They said their limit was maybe four years old.
[02:11:26.596 --> 02:11:27.916]  That's who they were.
[02:11:27.916 --> 02:11:30.556]  They had no bottom, no limit, and they had reached the bottom.
[02:11:30.556 --> 02:11:31.597]  They were beyond the gutter.
[02:11:31.597 --> 02:11:33.657]  The gutter was a ceiling to them.
[02:11:33.657 --> 02:11:36.097]  And you're seeing the same thing happen in lefty protest culture.
[02:11:36.097 --> 02:11:45.179]  You're seeing the same thing happen in the call-out culture of Twitter and social media that's targeting to harass, to harangue innocent, ordinary, everyday people.
[02:11:45.179 --> 02:11:49.320]  And the more innocent their behavior, the more they're targeted, the more they're lied about, the more they're tarnished.
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:51.241]  It's old tar and feather techniques.
[02:11:51.241 --> 02:11:52.983]  It's old banishment techniques.
[02:11:52.983 --> 02:11:54.464]  It's old censorship through shaming techniques.
[02:11:54.464 --> 02:11:56.445]  It's like you said, we're adopting the Chinese model.
[02:11:56.445 --> 02:11:57.046]  Absolutely.
[02:11:57.046 --> 02:11:58.047]  In fact, that's what's really happening.
[02:11:58.047 --> 02:12:16.081]  The big tech is combining, has already been doing it for five to ten years, working with the Chinese government, Google and Facebook and YouTube and the others, in order to be able to create a soc... where you have big corporate power and big state power united with big tech to control the mindset and the thoughts and what audience is allowed to hear out in the world.
[02:12:16.841 --> 02:12:23.324]  And they're going to take that Chinese model that they've already been employing, that they've already been using to discriminate, to censorship, to shame, to control.
[02:12:23.324 --> 02:12:25.605]  And they're rolling it out now?
[02:12:25.605 --> 02:12:25.965]  Absolutely.
[02:12:25.965 --> 02:12:27.165]  Doing it right here in the United States.
[02:12:27.165 --> 02:12:28.026]  And they need a premise for it.
[02:12:28.026 --> 02:12:29.166]  They need a pretext for it.
[02:12:29.166 --> 02:12:33.288]  The pretext was never going to be, hey, by the way, we want to do thought control.
[02:12:33.288 --> 02:12:37.069]  Their pretext was going to be, there's some dangerous thoughts out there that you need to not hear.
[02:12:37.069 --> 02:12:40.691]  There's some dangerous people out there that you need to not be exposed to.
[02:12:40.691 --> 02:12:42.351]  Like you said, it's not even about censoring us.
[02:12:42.351 --> 02:12:43.932]  It's about controlling what other people can see.
[02:12:43.932 --> 02:12:46.473]  They're telling people, hey, we're going to tell you what you can read or listen to.
[02:12:46.693 --> 02:12:46.973]  Correct.
[02:12:46.973 --> 02:12:48.995]  They want to control the audience.
[02:12:48.995 --> 02:12:50.856]  I will always be able to speak.
[02:12:50.856 --> 02:12:53.238]  The question is who gets to hear me?
[02:12:53.238 --> 02:12:55.059]  The question is who do I get to hear?
[02:12:55.059 --> 02:12:56.340]  Do I get to hear Alex Jones?
[02:12:56.340 --> 02:12:57.741]  Do I get to hear other people?
[02:12:57.741 --> 02:13:05.806]  Or am I shut off and only allowed to hear NBC and ABC and CBS and Rachel Maddow with her latest crazy collusion theory or conspiracy theory?
[02:13:05.806 --> 02:13:09.709]  So the conspiracy theories are always okay if it's the establishment spreading it about ordinary people.
[02:13:10.029 --> 02:13:15.013]  It's just not okay if ordinary people talk about it in relationship to the political and media and corporate establishment.
[02:13:15.013 --> 02:13:16.374]  And so that's what's happening.
[02:13:16.374 --> 02:13:18.796]  It's mind control, it's thought control, it's social control.
[02:13:18.796 --> 02:13:21.337]  They think like the Catholic Church of the 15th century.
[02:13:21.337 --> 02:13:35.608]  And what they're really offended by is they want to, not that what the Catholic school's students are being taught, they're offended that they don't get to be the Catholic Church, their own version of an ideology that is controlling and possessive in the way that the 15th century Inquisition was.
[02:13:35.928 --> 02:13:36.508]  That's what they want.
[02:13:36.508 --> 02:13:39.689]  That's why they're using inquisitional tactics, inquisitional techniques.
[02:13:39.689 --> 02:13:42.630]  They're doing things that have been done historically over and over again.
[02:13:42.630 --> 02:13:46.891]  They're just doing it in a new context and disguising and hiding what it actually is.
[02:13:46.891 --> 02:13:56.654]  What's scary is, even ten years ago, the average leftist priest-class controller, high up, knew what was going on, but most of the mid-level low-level knew nothing.
[02:13:56.654 --> 02:13:57.714]  They've actually gotten such a...
[02:13:59.670 --> 02:14:01.652]  Cultural bankruptcy now.
[02:14:01.652 --> 02:14:05.736]  That even their mid-level and low-level folks, a lot of them get that it's a takeover.
[02:14:05.736 --> 02:14:07.237]  They get it's cynical.
[02:14:07.237 --> 02:14:08.739]  They get it's a fraud.
[02:14:08.739 --> 02:14:12.062]  And they see our Western open values as a weakness.
[02:14:12.062 --> 02:14:14.745]  And they're just expanding the confines of the cult.
[02:14:15.245 --> 02:14:15.945]  Precisely.
[02:14:15.945 --> 02:14:17.546]  They see it as an opportunity.
[02:14:17.546 --> 02:14:19.307]  They see it as a hole in the gate.
[02:14:19.307 --> 02:14:35.696]  And because they believe in sort of a barrier society of their own accord, barriers being what you're allowed to see, what you're allowed to think, what you're allowed to express, what you're allowed to say, what you're allowed to believe, who you're allowed to vote for, they think in those terms and so they look at all the means and mechanisms to have influence over people's minds.
[02:14:36.116 --> 02:14:41.919]  I mean, I started in civil rights cases doing ballot access, because that was just about your opportunity to vote for who you want.
[02:14:41.919 --> 02:14:45.141]  But increasingly, it's moved now to the tech space and the media space.
[02:14:45.141 --> 02:14:47.722]  It's about what the audience can hear.
[02:14:47.722 --> 02:14:51.404]  Can they hear your voice on any particular technological medium that's available to them?
[02:14:51.404 --> 02:14:52.265]  Or is that foreclosed?
[02:14:52.265 --> 02:14:53.005]  Is that shut down?
[02:14:53.005 --> 02:14:54.005]  Is that shut out?
[02:14:54.005 --> 02:14:58.148]  It's all about making sure you only hear the correct ideas from the correct people.
[02:14:59.292 --> 02:15:06.226]  Classical, thoroughbred, authoritarian, super oppressive, pure evil.
[02:15:06.226 --> 02:15:08.250]  I mean, it's the bonafide
[02:15:09.349 --> 02:15:12.970]  End of civilization, and it's just rampaging forward.
[02:15:12.970 --> 02:15:14.171]  Absolutely, and it's the way they think.
[02:15:14.171 --> 02:15:26.696]  They really, if you want to understand their mindset, want to understand their approach, their mentality, simply go and look at how authoritarian regimes have acted in the past, particularly the Inquisition era in the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th century.
[02:15:26.696 --> 02:15:32.598]  Because they think the same way, they behave the same way, and they're going to continue to until the resistance succeeds at undermining what they're trying to do.
[02:15:34.102 --> 02:15:46.317]  Well, I mean, if conservatives or nationalists or free speech folks don't stop bowing down to every politically correct statement, they only make us acquiescing to them the green light to demand more and more and more and more.
[02:15:46.317 --> 02:15:49.662]  To the point of now, Google says they're going to ban the word family.
[02:15:49.662 --> 02:15:50.142]  That's right.
[02:15:50.142 --> 02:15:50.863]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:50.863 --> 02:15:51.264]  Stay with us.
[02:15:55.322 --> 02:15:57.704]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?

[02:16:00.566 --> 02:16:05.630]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:16:05.630 --> 02:16:12.815]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:16:12.815 --> 02:16:17.379]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:16:17.959 --> 02:16:21.602]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:16:21.602 --> 02:16:24.725]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:16:24.725 --> 02:16:27.367]  It hit me when I was arrested.

[02:16:55.678 --> 02:16:56.899]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.899 --> 02:17:00.821]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.821 --> 02:17:02.362]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:02.362 --> 02:17:05.324]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:05.324 --> 02:17:10.888]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:17:25.177 --> 02:17:31.540]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:31.540 --> 02:17:34.582]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:34.582 --> 02:17:40.505]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:40.505 --> 02:17:44.287]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:44.287 --> 02:17:45.547]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:45.547 --> 02:17:46.908]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.908 --> 02:17:53.111]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:53.111 --> 02:17:54.532]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:58.976 --> 02:18:02.017]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:18:02.017 --> 02:18:08.459]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[02:18:08.459 --> 02:18:23.903]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[02:18:55.962 --> 02:19:04.493]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:19:04.493 --> 02:19:05.955]  Believe me, I know.
[02:19:05.955 --> 02:19:10.260]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:13.725]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:19:14.205 --> 02:19:15.886]  I still have that energy.
[02:19:15.886 --> 02:19:34.274]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need
[02:19:34.694 --> 02:19:36.796]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:08.405 --> 02:20:10.486]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:10.486 --> 02:20:13.006]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:20:13.006 --> 02:20:30.331]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:31.420 --> 02:20:45.383]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, a very famous, successful lawyer, who, as they say, is one of the biggest political gamblers in the world, and very, very successful, takes on a lot of those big underdog positions.
[02:20:45.383 --> 02:20:53.805]  I want to get into some of the other big news items and get into other areas of history and where you think the world's going, but I want listeners to understand something.
[02:20:53.805 --> 02:21:00.206]  Mainstream media, corporate-owned, corporate-controlled, has its basic agenda to keep people on a reservation.
[02:21:01.476 --> 02:21:10.061]  But if you pull back to the actual social control going on, it's all in the white papers, it's all in the engineering.
[02:21:10.061 --> 02:21:23.389]  And the fact that we have this post-pro-human view by the elite, that if they just become totally ruthless they can consolidate power and that they'll have the future, is just incredibly twisted.
[02:21:26.798 --> 02:21:29.341]  I think evil more than anything is not having any rules.
[02:21:29.341 --> 02:21:38.810]  And by rules, I don't mean the evil controlled rules that technocracies bring in, or authoritarian regimes, but not having the basic rules that are genetically encoded in us.
[02:21:38.810 --> 02:21:41.432]  These people violate these rules because it gives them limited power.
[02:21:42.133 --> 02:21:49.278]  And then as things break down, they create a cosmology that, well, that's just part of their overall organizational system to consolidate control.
[02:21:49.278 --> 02:21:53.740]  But the truth is, these are very, very lazy, twisted, fallen, unhappy people.
[02:21:53.740 --> 02:21:58.784]  And then even at a subconscious level, they then project their hatred of themselves onto us.
[02:21:58.784 --> 02:22:03.847]  Or how would you quantify the sickness in the world versus what's good in the world and where we are historically?
[02:22:04.665 --> 02:22:12.172]  I mean, to a certain degree, the problem that the sort of cultural left has is that ordinary Americans don't accept or adopt any of their viewpoints.
[02:22:12.172 --> 02:22:23.601]  That's why they have to do these censorship campaigns, these terror campaigns, like what they're doing to the Covington kids in order to sort of shape up middle America and get them to coerce them back into their mindset.
[02:22:23.601 --> 02:22:25.103]  Because the ordinary person doesn't believe it.
[02:22:25.103 --> 02:22:27.545]  The guy working at the factory, the guy working at the local shop,
[02:22:27.805 --> 02:22:39.289]  The guy working, doing his own thing, the local mechanic, he doesn't buy into any of this sort of cultural conformist nonsense, this sort of idolatry of ideology that the left is shaping and putting out there and perpetrating and propagating.
[02:22:39.289 --> 02:22:48.912]  And so the advantage is the ordinary person for the most part, the reason why Trump won, thinks a lot more along the lines of Trump than they do along the lines of the coercive cultural conformist left.
[02:22:49.512 --> 02:22:53.735]  And that's the great utility and advantage that the ordinary person has.
[02:22:53.735 --> 02:23:04.941]  But what they don't have is very little access to media power, very little access to cultural power, very little access to entertainment, very little access to the entire news infrastructure.
[02:23:04.941 --> 02:23:08.483]  And that's why they're waging such war on InfoWars and on you.
[02:23:08.483 --> 02:23:10.984]  They want all dissident voices to be shut down.
[02:23:10.984 --> 02:23:12.985]  All dissident voices to be silenced.
[02:23:12.985 --> 02:23:15.747]  So that the audience can't hear them, the audience can't share them.
[02:23:15.747 --> 02:23:17.868]  Imagine what could have happened to the Covington kids.
[02:23:18.388 --> 02:23:21.509]  If they didn't have anybody like you showing the real story.
[02:23:21.509 --> 02:23:29.791]  They may have been known 50 years from now as just being the kids who did some horrible racial taunting of a Native American at Lincoln Memorial when they were entirely innocent.
[02:23:29.791 --> 02:23:30.151]  Exactly.
[02:23:30.151 --> 02:23:33.872]  The establishment doesn't see it as our lives are failing.
[02:23:33.872 --> 02:23:36.793]  They're saying there's still voices that can call us on our lives.
[02:23:36.793 --> 02:23:39.254]  So the problem is we haven't eradicated those voices.
[02:23:39.254 --> 02:23:40.154]  Precisely.
[02:23:40.154 --> 02:23:41.034]  And that's how they think.
[02:23:41.034 --> 02:23:43.975]  They think we need to suppress the voices that the audience is hearing.
[02:23:44.555 --> 02:23:50.216]  It's the same thing that they did with sort of ballot access control at the beginning of the century involving Ralph Nader.
[02:23:50.216 --> 02:23:52.637]  Their goal wasn't Ralph Nader's particular voice.
[02:23:52.637 --> 02:24:01.939]  Their goal was to suppress the ability of third voices to have meaningful access to the ballot, and that was only about the voters' rights to choose whom they wanted and to express themselves accordingly.
[02:24:01.939 --> 02:24:03.999]  They're doing the same thing now in the speech space.
[02:24:03.999 --> 02:24:06.180]  They're doing the same thing now in the educational space.
[02:24:06.180 --> 02:24:08.400]  They're doing the same thing now in the entertainment space.
[02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:10.300]  They're doing the same thing now in the news space.
[02:24:10.300 --> 02:24:12.781]  They want to control all of the means and mechanisms by which our
[02:24:13.001 --> 02:24:24.787]  And they've gotten the traditional left that at least claimed that it defended free speech to now be the most ardent destroyers of speech, and they wonder why as soon as they shut down their competition, suddenly they're being laid off.
[02:24:24.787 --> 02:24:25.327]  Oh, precisely.
[02:24:25.327 --> 02:24:31.310]  Well, it's interesting, the people at BuzzFeed and Huffington Post that were laid off disproportionately were people that had libeled the Covington kits.
[02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:36.532]  So we'll see whether or not one way in which you could avoid suit was to fire those people.
[02:24:36.532 --> 02:24:43.894]  In fact, Covington Post got rid of its entire editorial department, and most likely the reason for it was their fear of the suit that was coming for the Covington kids.
[02:24:43.894 --> 02:24:55.158]  So the advantage of people exerting their legal rights, their legal remedies to the jury system and to the court system in this country, in middle America, is they can take even the most powerful institutions, the most powerful people,
[02:24:55.538 --> 02:24:56.078]  I don't
[02:25:17.825 --> 02:25:23.350]  To then cause harm and pain, and then they admit it's done for a political aim to set the process.
[02:25:23.350 --> 02:25:34.459]  We'll talk about that after the break, because you've got some really, some of the most astute, piercing views, reading my cases, that even some of my lawyers do, and you're not in the cases, so you can speak to it.
[02:25:34.459 --> 02:25:35.861]  Obviously they can't.
[02:25:35.861 --> 02:25:39.804]  But before we do that, I mentioned Owen yesterday in DC.
[02:25:39.804 --> 02:25:41.806]  There's so many of these clips, we can't even play them all here.
[02:25:41.806 --> 02:25:42.626]  Here's just one guy.
[02:25:43.507 --> 02:25:46.409]  If you're a radio listener, there's a big giant rat on trailer.
[02:25:46.409 --> 02:25:48.651]  He walks over, oh, what's this giant rat?
[02:25:48.651 --> 02:25:54.595]  Nut job leftist melts down each InfoWars reporter's mic over nothing.
[02:25:54.595 --> 02:25:57.477]  And so here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:57.477 --> 02:26:02.101]  You know, I'd like to speak to the creator of said rat.
[02:26:02.101 --> 02:26:03.341]  And let's see what he has.
[02:26:03.341 --> 02:26:05.103]  It's a giant rat with Trump's head on it.
[02:26:05.103 --> 02:26:07.825]  Should be interesting.
[02:26:07.825 --> 02:26:08.025]  Wow.
[02:26:11.661 --> 02:26:17.203]  Leftists always treat it like a straw man, like a brimp, or a rat, and they're like, then that's you.
[02:26:17.203 --> 02:26:19.044]  But if you approach the idol, they get mad.
[02:26:19.044 --> 02:26:19.344]  Here we go.
[02:26:33.041 --> 02:26:35.642]  So, uh, you like fascism?
[02:26:35.642 --> 02:26:37.442]  I don't like fascists.
[02:26:37.442 --> 02:26:38.943]  I don't like Info Wars.
[02:26:38.943 --> 02:26:40.624]  I don't like young Nazis.
[02:26:40.624 --> 02:26:42.624]  In fact, I like young Nazis.
[02:26:42.624 --> 02:26:43.705]  Whoa!
[02:26:43.705 --> 02:26:44.225]  Yeah.
[02:26:44.225 --> 02:26:46.966]  I know that if someone were to come up... You're behaving like a fascist.
[02:26:46.966 --> 02:26:47.786]  No, no, no.
[02:26:47.786 --> 02:26:49.727]  This guy's literally in my face right now.
[02:26:49.727 --> 02:26:50.247]  Wait a minute.
[02:26:50.247 --> 02:26:51.767]  Who walked up to who?
[02:26:51.767 --> 02:26:52.007]  You!
[02:26:52.007 --> 02:26:52.768]  I have it on tape.
[02:26:52.768 --> 02:26:54.248]  You literally just walked up to me.
[02:26:54.248 --> 02:26:55.588]  Oh, now you're trying to assault me?
[02:26:55.588 --> 02:26:56.009]  Oh, yeah.
[02:26:56.009 --> 02:26:56.749]  Are you going to assault me?
[02:26:57.509 --> 02:26:58.170]  What are you doing?
[02:26:58.170 --> 02:26:59.611]  Don't touch my equipment!
[02:26:59.611 --> 02:27:00.311]  Touch your equipment?
[02:27:00.311 --> 02:27:01.973]  You are a freak show!
[02:27:01.973 --> 02:27:03.634]  Oh my God!
[02:27:03.634 --> 02:27:04.675]  Are you going to return that?
[02:27:04.675 --> 02:27:06.877]  No.
[02:27:06.877 --> 02:27:08.218]  Can I please have my mic cover?
[02:27:08.218 --> 02:27:09.759]  Steals his mic cover, bites it off.
[02:27:09.759 --> 02:27:10.580]  Oh my God!
[02:27:10.580 --> 02:27:13.322]  This is an unhinged lunatic, sir!
[02:27:13.322 --> 02:27:15.064]  Come on, put my mic cover... Wow!
[02:27:16.567 --> 02:27:17.488]  There we go.
[02:27:17.488 --> 02:27:18.749]  Did it melt yet?
[02:27:18.749 --> 02:27:20.451]  So seriously, do you have a mental disorder, sir?
[02:27:20.451 --> 02:27:21.512]  Do I have a mental disorder?
[02:27:21.512 --> 02:27:22.573]  Do you have a mental disorder?
[02:27:22.573 --> 02:27:23.153]  What's wrong with you?
[02:27:23.153 --> 02:27:24.355]  Do you want one?
[02:27:24.355 --> 02:27:27.398]  Dude, you walk up to me, you try to spit on me.
[02:27:27.398 --> 02:27:28.859]  I didn't spit on you.
[02:27:28.859 --> 02:27:30.721]  You licked your finger and you tried to put it in my eye.
[02:27:31.542 --> 02:27:32.022]  No, no, no.
[02:27:32.022 --> 02:27:35.304]  I was going for the lens.
[02:27:35.304 --> 02:27:36.564]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[02:27:36.564 --> 02:27:38.505]  The full video is on Unforced.com.
[02:27:38.505 --> 02:27:41.086]  This guy doesn't want to be interviewed for his big rap.
[02:27:41.086 --> 02:27:44.368]  He wants to flip out on somebody's speech and try to stop it.
[02:27:44.368 --> 02:27:46.549]  So it's beyond him just trying to act extreme.
[02:27:46.549 --> 02:27:53.352]  Their own derangement trying to provoke the public, because that's in the documents, into derangement, has now made them derange.
[02:27:53.712 --> 02:27:53.992]  Correct.
[02:27:53.992 --> 02:27:55.133]  And what they do is projection.
[02:27:55.133 --> 02:27:56.553]  It's sort of the old mirror principle.
[02:27:56.553 --> 02:28:06.318]  So I tell people if you're with somebody and somebody's making some crazy argument or accusation against you, often, and it doesn't make any sense, just go and replace the you with an I. And they'll often be confessing.
[02:28:06.318 --> 02:28:08.219]  They'll often be telling you their whole story.
[02:28:08.219 --> 02:28:09.840]  And that's precisely what's happening here.
[02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:12.601]  The left is accusing people like you of doing what they are doing.
[02:28:13.461 --> 02:28:14.282]  Just like this guy is.
[02:28:14.282 --> 02:28:21.645]  This guy is accusing the reporter of being the fascist, getting into his face, when he's the one acting in a fascistic manner and getting into his face.
[02:28:21.645 --> 02:28:23.405]  He's the one being sort of physical with him.
[02:28:23.405 --> 02:28:24.966]  He's the one attacking equipment.
[02:28:24.966 --> 02:28:27.767]  He's the one doing all that activity while accusing the other person of doing it.
[02:28:28.027 --> 02:28:35.009]  And this is a pattern in practice, modus operandi with the ideological left, is to accuse the other of that which they themselves do.
[02:28:35.009 --> 02:28:41.031]  To use the legal system inappropriately and improperly to attack others for what they themselves should be sued for.
[02:28:41.031 --> 02:28:46.712]  For the justice they themselves should... And they've all been trained the same, where they get physical and it doesn't work, they back off.
[02:28:46.712 --> 02:28:49.093]  They're trying to get you to attack them so they can sue you.
[02:28:49.093 --> 02:28:49.733]  Correct, exactly.
[02:28:49.733 --> 02:28:56.455]  It's all about instigation, it's all about provocation, it's old school tactics, old school techniques, going all the way back to Willenstein... Bacon lovers!

[02:32:54.364 --> 02:32:59.786]  You need to try TurboForce today.
[02:32:59.786 --> 02:33:02.407]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.265 --> 02:33:27.257]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:27.257 --> 02:33:31.968]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.631 --> 02:33:48.045]  Alright, now in the first hour today, I had Eric Mankow Muller on, Connecticut radio host, good friend of mine, and he was bringing up how people like Howard Stern now say Alex Jones doesn't deserve free speech.
[02:33:48.045 --> 02:33:56.654]  Now last year, in August, when I got deplatformed, at first, he did some fake spoof pieces, and I've been on the show before, that were more good-hearted.
[02:33:58.226 --> 02:34:03.412]  Now he's doing spoof pieces with these comedians that can hit my voice pretty damn well.
[02:34:03.412 --> 02:34:09.778]  They even use exact things I say and mix it with lies to say that I say nobody died at Sandy Hook and I'm bullying dead kids.
[02:34:09.778 --> 02:34:13.743]  And then I get sued for saying things I haven't said, but they don't get sued for making jokes.
[02:34:13.743 --> 02:34:15.264]  I say they have a free speech right to do that.
[02:34:16.124 --> 02:34:23.132]  But we have Robert Barnes of at Barnes underscore law, one of the top lawyers in the country when it comes to dealing with things like this.
[02:34:23.132 --> 02:34:26.757]  And obviously behind the scenes, we're looking at doing some things offensively.
[02:34:26.757 --> 02:34:30.821]  But I want to get his expert take because my cases are meant to affect everybody.
[02:34:31.582 --> 02:34:31.982]  I don't know.
[02:34:50.613 --> 02:34:51.734]  Uh, oh, wait a second.
[02:34:51.734 --> 02:34:52.354]  On our phone.
[02:34:52.354 --> 02:34:53.675]  I knew this was going to happen now.
[02:34:53.675 --> 02:34:55.036]  Now we're going to get into a whole thing.
[02:34:55.036 --> 02:34:56.958]  Here's Alex Jones.
[02:34:56.958 --> 02:34:58.699]  Hi Alex, how are you doing, man?
[02:34:58.699 --> 02:35:00.060]  I know you're probably freaking out.
[02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:01.641]  I don't know why we're having you on.
[02:35:01.641 --> 02:35:02.622]  Nobody else will.
[02:35:02.622 --> 02:35:03.322]  Right, all right.
[02:35:03.322 --> 02:35:04.043]  Go ahead.
[02:35:04.043 --> 02:35:04.943]  Good morning, Howard.
[02:35:04.943 --> 02:35:05.604]  Good morning, Rob.
[02:35:05.604 --> 02:35:12.469]  I want to commend you on a beautiful globalist misrepresentation of wars, news wars, and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:14.310]  Well, what are you going to do now?
[02:35:14.310 --> 02:35:15.331]  I mean, you're in big trouble.
[02:35:16.031 --> 02:35:18.873]  Howard, the establishment has made their move against free speech in America.
[02:35:18.873 --> 02:35:22.555]  The shadow ban of Christianity, nationalism, liberalism has happened.
[02:35:22.555 --> 02:35:24.416]  Draconian censorship in control of the air.
[02:35:24.416 --> 02:35:27.938]  Alright, well, you know, what is going on?
[02:35:27.938 --> 02:35:28.759]  What is reality?
[02:35:29.537 --> 02:35:36.020]  What's going on right now is the CHOCOMS, the foreign banks, the Monarch debt, the corporate mercenaries, they're trying to kill my free speech.
[02:35:36.020 --> 02:35:40.222]  And if I listen closely, I can hear Hillary Clinton pulling the puppet strings on you.
[02:35:40.222 --> 02:35:41.862]  I can hear it behind you, Howard.
[02:35:41.862 --> 02:35:42.923]  Listen, it's not me.
[02:35:42.923 --> 02:35:45.404]  I'm telling people it's the way of the world.
[02:35:45.404 --> 02:35:46.484]  This is what happens.
[02:35:46.484 --> 02:35:50.046]  There's only certain parameters in every medium.
[02:35:50.706 --> 02:35:55.150]  Howard, it doesn't matter what happens to me, as long as we win the war.
[02:35:55.150 --> 02:35:59.514]  The globalists will not win, you will not win, Hillary Clinton will not win, alright?
[02:35:59.514 --> 02:36:01.676]  Well, where are you taking the war now?
[02:36:01.676 --> 02:36:03.078]  Where will you go?
[02:36:03.078 --> 02:36:05.520]  Timberwars.com, where my revenue streams.
[02:36:07.295 --> 02:36:08.476]  That's some InfoWars product.
[02:36:08.476 --> 02:36:12.458]  Go ahead, I don't care.
[02:36:12.458 --> 02:36:15.059]  SuperShield X Survival Milk.
[02:36:15.059 --> 02:36:17.521]  It's a mix of milk and... SuperShield Survival Milk!
[02:36:17.521 --> 02:36:19.282]  Let the man talk, Rob.
[02:36:19.282 --> 02:36:21.383]  Don't say, shut up, Rob.
[02:36:21.383 --> 02:36:28.507]  It helps build stronger communication, makes you punch through concrete, it'll make your piss taste like grapefruit juice.
[02:36:28.507 --> 02:36:30.849]  There's a tough drink in the deep state, Kool-Aid.
[02:36:30.849 --> 02:36:33.030]  You can't drink this piss!
[02:36:33.030 --> 02:36:34.070]  Can I hear that commercial again?
[02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:35.111]  That was really good.
[02:36:35.111 --> 02:36:36.012]  You want another product?
[02:36:36.012 --> 02:36:36.572]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:36:38.620 --> 02:36:39.961]  Super X Alpha Male 3000.
[02:36:39.961 --> 02:36:42.982]  It's a mix of baby powder and lead.
[02:36:42.982 --> 02:36:46.643]  Helps build your immune system, stronger concentration, faster blinking.
[02:36:46.643 --> 02:36:48.264]  You'll be breathing like an octopus.
[02:36:48.264 --> 02:36:50.305]  Do 3000 push-ups in a second.
[02:36:50.305 --> 02:36:54.126]  Do you like the weekly world news?
[02:36:54.126 --> 02:36:55.026]  You've got the same advertisers.
[02:36:55.026 --> 02:36:56.467]  Yeah, those are great ads!
[02:37:00.149 --> 02:37:01.050]  Alright, let's stop there.
[02:37:31.058 --> 02:37:33.979]  I haven't plugged this hour, so I thought I'd let Howard Stern plug for us.
[02:37:33.979 --> 02:37:37.280]  There's no lead, there's no concrete in our products.
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:38.180]  That's what they do, though.
[02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:39.780]  They make a big joke out of it.
[02:37:39.780 --> 02:37:40.740]  We are Lister-supported.
[02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:42.921]  It is the last week of Sermal Vitality.
[02:37:42.921 --> 02:37:45.022]  It's just known cold-pressed herbs.
[02:37:45.022 --> 02:37:45.802]  Super high quality.
[02:37:45.802 --> 02:37:48.342]  We can't even get it anymore because it's wall-crafted.
[02:37:48.342 --> 02:37:48.742]  That's 50% off.
[02:37:48.742 --> 02:37:51.223]  Everybody knows how good turmeric is for you.
[02:37:51.223 --> 02:37:52.523]  We have bodies.
[02:37:52.523 --> 02:37:53.704]  95% curcuminoid.
[02:37:53.704 --> 02:37:56.304]  The average turmeric product is 5% curcuminoid.
[02:37:56.304 --> 02:37:57.645]  That's 50% off.
[02:37:57.645 --> 02:37:58.345]  And we also have
[02:37:59.225 --> 02:38:10.350]  The new product that is TurboForce that has clean-burning, healthy plant-derived stimulants that burn over 10 hours.
[02:38:11.138 --> 02:38:24.928]  Without the crash at the end, without all the sugars, and all the red dyes, and all the crap, and we've got it in tropical berry flavor, and it is the best next level energy drink, pre-workout, whatever you want to call it.
[02:38:24.928 --> 02:38:26.228]  It's liquid energy.
[02:38:26.228 --> 02:38:29.991]  It's TurboForce, at M4WarsLive.com, or AAA253-3139.
[02:38:29.991 --> 02:38:37.416]  You know, it's funny hearing them parody my voice, particularly when I'm hoarse right now, and the thing, you know, I'm not the parody.
[02:38:37.416 --> 02:38:38.017]  I'm the real one.
[02:38:38.777 --> 02:38:44.120]  A little bit crazy, but Robert Barnes, Attorney at Law, you just put up with that plug there brought to us by Howard Stern.
[02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:52.264]  Getting specifically into your view, just reading over the different Sandy Hook suits and others, even the statesman last week said it's an incredible suit.
[02:38:52.264 --> 02:38:54.205]  They admit he never said the people's names.
[02:38:55.089 --> 02:38:56.270]  Correct, and it's a major problem.
[02:38:56.270 --> 02:38:59.072]  For example, compare and contrast it to the Covington case.
[02:38:59.072 --> 02:39:13.582]  So in the Covington case, they identified the individuals, they identified them by their visual image, they shared links that identified to them, they shared the school they were at, the location they were at, and then they put out a photo shot and then they asked for them to be doxed all across the country.
[02:39:13.582 --> 02:39:14.403]  And beaten.
[02:39:14.403 --> 02:39:14.923]  Exactly.
[02:39:14.923 --> 02:39:17.024]  And then the violence threats came after that.
[02:39:17.024 --> 02:39:20.747]  And then by contrast, compared to what the accusations are in your case.
[02:39:20.747 --> 02:39:23.529]  So in your case, there's no accusation of identifying anybody by name.
[02:39:23.849 --> 02:39:24.410]  We're good to go.
[02:39:47.188 --> 02:39:53.351]  Or even name them, or even show their image, or even show their home, or even show their location, or even videotape them outside of their home.
[02:39:53.351 --> 02:39:59.453]  And they admit that in some of the suits, but like you said, I love my lawyers, they should have put that up front in the briefs.
[02:39:59.453 --> 02:40:02.814]  It's key to highlight that, because I think a lot of people have misunderstood that aspect.
[02:40:02.814 --> 02:40:09.537]  Because some people have asked me, they say, okay, Mr. Barnes, you're representing the Covington kids, you know Mr. Jones, do you think the cases are similar?
[02:40:09.537 --> 02:40:11.418]  And I'm like, no they're not, they're radically opposite.
[02:40:11.778 --> 02:40:14.540]  In the Covington case, they identified them by their photograph.
[02:40:14.540 --> 02:40:15.781]  They put their photograph everywhere.
[02:40:15.781 --> 02:40:19.304]  They put them up in a photo, they called it a hit list, a photographic hit list.
[02:40:19.304 --> 02:40:21.345]  And it just happened, it wasn't eight years ago.
[02:40:21.345 --> 02:40:26.069]  Exactly, and they're doing it everywhere, and they're doing it broad scale, and they're doing it wholesale, and they're doing it pervasively.
[02:40:26.069 --> 02:40:28.251]  By contrast, none of that happened here.
[02:40:28.251 --> 02:40:30.893]  Even the lawyers on the other side didn't even allege it.
[02:40:30.893 --> 02:40:32.274]  They didn't even claim it.
[02:40:32.274 --> 02:40:34.295]  In fact, they bury it in like paragraph 88.
[02:40:34.295 --> 02:40:40.580]  They say, well, because any question was ever raised about anything that might have happened in Sandy Hook, that by definition is liable.
[02:40:40.580 --> 02:40:41.261]  That's not the law.
[02:40:41.721 --> 02:40:45.225]  The law is, in order to be liable, you individually have to be targeted.
[02:40:45.225 --> 02:40:46.366]  That's what happened in Covington.
[02:40:46.366 --> 02:40:47.907]  They were individually targeted.
[02:40:47.907 --> 02:40:56.616]  There was a request to dox those individuals whose photograph and video was shared around the entire world, who the media linked to, who the media said, go here and look at who these people are.
[02:40:56.616 --> 02:40:57.337]  So what are they thinking?
[02:40:58.470 --> 02:41:03.551]  I think their approach is basically to, if they could, destroy you.
[02:41:03.551 --> 02:41:09.272]  Destroy your legacy, destroy your history, destroy your audience's right to hear independent viewpoints from you.
[02:41:09.272 --> 02:41:11.213]  They think they can destroy the ability... Well, that's it.
[02:41:11.213 --> 02:41:13.993]  They're really targeting the audience so they all feel alone.
[02:41:13.993 --> 02:41:17.774]  You read the WikiLeaks, it's like, we must make right-wingers and nationals feel alone.
[02:41:17.774 --> 02:41:19.614]  We must not let them have a community.
[02:41:19.614 --> 02:41:21.895]  And beyond anything, Infowars is like a coral reef.
[02:41:22.375 --> 02:41:28.502]  We're the listeners or the fish and I'm just a coral and we're all an ecosystem and they don't want us to have a home.
[02:41:28.502 --> 02:41:28.902]  Precisely.
[02:41:28.902 --> 02:41:30.724]  They don't want independent voices to be out there.
[02:41:30.724 --> 02:41:37.872]  They don't want anybody raising questions about the political establishment, raising questions about the media establishment, raising questions about the corporate establishment.
[02:41:38.152 --> 02:41:39.633]  In the same way, look at this case.
[02:41:39.633 --> 02:41:46.937]  This is a case that easily could have disappeared if there was an independent journalist, independent press, out there raising questions, showing what the truth is.
[02:41:46.937 --> 02:41:55.642]  These kids' lives could have been ruined over a lie, but for the ability of the independent press to raise the right questions, to challenge and contest the establishment narrative.
[02:41:55.642 --> 02:41:56.783]  They want to suppress.
[02:41:56.783 --> 02:42:03.947]  Your voice has been, and Infowars' voice, has been one of the most loudest, clearest voices for an independent, dissident political viewpoint.
[02:42:04.127 --> 02:42:04.888]  And it's so simple, but it's true.
[02:42:33.206 --> 02:42:35.287]  They're trying to control what people can hear.
[02:42:35.287 --> 02:42:43.353]  They're insulting people, saying they're a bunch of idiots and they can't be trusted to actually listen and see different ideas.
[02:42:43.353 --> 02:42:43.853]  Exactly.
[02:42:43.853 --> 02:42:44.393]  That's the goal.
[02:42:44.393 --> 02:42:45.954]  The goal is to control the listener.
[02:42:45.954 --> 02:42:51.057]  Not to control the speaker, but to control the listener and prevent them from knowing their truth and deciding their own truth.
[02:42:51.057 --> 02:42:52.178]  How do we go on the offense?
[02:42:52.178 --> 02:42:52.959]  We'll ask that question.
[02:42:58.004 --> 02:43:01.025]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:43:01.025 --> 02:43:07.466]  While coffee, candy and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[02:44:51.440 --> 02:45:00.843]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:45:03.365 --> 02:45:06.488]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:45:06.488 --> 02:45:09.170]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:45:09.170 --> 02:45:13.474]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:45:13.474 --> 02:45:20.961]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:45:20.961 --> 02:45:23.383]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now.
[02:45:26.821 --> 02:45:28.682]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:45:28.682 --> 02:45:29.462]  They called it U.N.
[02:45:29.462 --> 02:45:31.763]  Agenda 21, now they call it the U.N.
[02:45:31.763 --> 02:45:32.463]  2030 Agenda.
[02:45:32.463 --> 02:45:43.967]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:45:43.967 --> 02:45:45.547]  It's the David Knight Show!
[02:45:45.547 --> 02:45:48.508]  Never miss your show, any day.
[02:45:48.508 --> 02:45:49.129]  I mean, what?
[02:45:49.129 --> 02:45:49.809]  I mean, never!
[02:45:56.141 --> 02:45:58.482]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:45:58.482 --> 02:46:05.106]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[02:46:59.184 --> 02:47:07.830]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:07.830 --> 02:47:11.853]  When I was coming from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[02:47:13.797 --> 02:47:18.499]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[02:47:18.499 --> 02:47:24.080]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:28.862]  He said, it's a long walk to Nashville, would you like to ride?
[02:47:28.862 --> 02:47:31.503]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:31.503 --> 02:47:36.684]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:47:38.677 --> 02:47:39.538]  Robert Barnes is our guest.
[02:47:39.538 --> 02:47:43.364]  Robert, you've looked at the lawsuits against us.
[02:47:53.626 --> 02:47:54.987]  I think it's the same thing my lawyers say.
[02:47:54.987 --> 02:47:55.988]  This is new law.
[02:47:55.988 --> 02:47:57.008]  This has never happened before.
[02:47:57.008 --> 02:48:03.012]  But they think tens of thousands of fake news articles about what I supposedly done is going to carry this through.
[02:48:03.012 --> 02:48:07.355]  But the Connecticut case, they go, give us your business model on Sandy Hook.
[02:48:07.355 --> 02:48:12.638]  There's no business model about the news you're going to say or what you're going to cover or your views.
[02:48:12.638 --> 02:48:14.099]  We didn't have some pre-meeting about it.
[02:48:15.347 --> 02:48:16.907]  And it's the same thing.
[02:48:16.907 --> 02:48:19.068]  There is no marketing information on Sandy Hook.
[02:48:19.068 --> 02:48:24.889]  They're saying my whole life of Sandy Hook, when it's not even one-tenth of one, one-hundredth percent.
[02:48:24.889 --> 02:48:36.451]  But you were off there talking about how crazy that suit is, where, again, they just think, well, we've got Connecticut, well, we've got, you know, we'll get this Texan, we'll put him up here, we'll show him how the world works.
[02:48:36.451 --> 02:48:38.171]  And to me, it's just a travesty for this country.
[02:48:38.171 --> 02:48:41.552]  I'm not even really worried about it, because I know what I said when I did, versus what they said.
[02:48:41.932 --> 02:48:45.053]  Well, the interesting thing is they're really challenging everything you've ever said.
[02:48:45.053 --> 02:48:52.036]  So they're trying to say that every accusation ever made by anybody at Infowars, all of it is fake, all of it is false, when they know otherwise.
[02:48:52.036 --> 02:48:54.676]  And I think part of it is because that's how they want to brand the business model.
[02:48:54.676 --> 02:49:01.539]  Part of it is probably because some of the lawyers who drafted it really think that the Homeland version of Alex Jones is true on Showtime.
[02:49:01.539 --> 02:49:04.860]  Instead, and what that affords, it opens the door to some people who probably don't want
[02:49:04.980 --> 02:49:07.722]  I never watch that show, but I watch boildowns of it.
[02:49:07.722 --> 02:49:10.483]  And exactly, everybody thinks that's really me.
[02:49:10.483 --> 02:49:12.364]  That's the corporate media.
[02:49:12.364 --> 02:49:12.764]  Exactly.
[02:49:12.764 --> 02:49:15.025]  That's the entirely fake version of who you are.
[02:49:15.025 --> 02:49:21.409]  But the interesting thing is it really opens the door for you to get to prove some things that you've never had the court access to do.
[02:49:21.409 --> 02:49:28.773]  So for example, they've made certain accusations about things that were said about John Podesta or Tony Podesta, were said about David Brock.
[02:49:28.773 --> 02:49:30.114]  Imagine when I show the jury.
[02:49:31.195 --> 02:49:34.818]  Tony Podesta in the Washington Post with pictures of naked kids.
[02:49:34.818 --> 02:49:39.783]  Well not only that, it really affords and opens the door to you to ask to do depositions of third-party individuals.
[02:49:39.783 --> 02:49:53.455]  So you should have a right to do discovery of John Podesta, do discovery of Tony Podesta, do discovery of David Brock, find out about some of their rather interesting histories and some of the things they've been up to politically, and all of these other people that have done very... And find out about the kids in the hot tub.
[02:49:53.955 --> 02:49:54.996]  Find out about all of it.
[02:49:54.996 --> 02:50:00.739]  Find out about all the details of all of these individuals, what really happened, because they're claiming that none of those things ever happened.
[02:50:00.739 --> 02:50:09.824]  Not only that they make certain statements about Sandy Hook, but they claim any accusation that has ever been made by InfoWars against anybody in a position of power or privilege is not true.
[02:50:09.824 --> 02:50:10.845]  Exactly.
[02:50:10.845 --> 02:50:15.847]  They say that we sit around a boardroom and go, what is the most hurtful thing we can say?
[02:50:15.847 --> 02:50:16.348]  Let's do it.
[02:50:17.248 --> 02:50:19.190]  And then meanwhile, that's not the case.
[02:50:19.190 --> 02:50:25.234]  But then, is that because with the Democrats and the establishment, we know they have meanings than planned stuff.
[02:50:25.234 --> 02:50:27.036]  So I guess they think we're doing the same thing.
[02:50:27.036 --> 02:50:27.316]  Correct.
[02:50:27.316 --> 02:50:29.277]  I think that they basically project.
[02:50:29.277 --> 02:50:32.860]  It's amazing how easy it is to understand what their mindset is by just putting on to them.
[02:50:32.860 --> 02:50:39.065]  You kept saying like at dinner, you said, listen, as soon as I figured out, if I just go off what they're accusing me of, they're giving me a roadmap of who they are.
[02:50:39.065 --> 02:50:39.465]  Precisely.
[02:50:39.465 --> 02:50:40.226]  It's extraordinary.
[02:50:40.226 --> 02:50:44.129]  It's a very predictive of these kind of sociopathological individuals and institutions.
[02:50:44.489 --> 02:50:48.792]  And so you take that, you look at it, you put it back on them, and they'll give you a road map of who they are and what they're about.
[02:50:48.792 --> 02:51:03.842]  And what they've really done, and they haven't realized they've done this, the people orchestrating this hit job against you through lawfare, they don't realize they've opened the door to you to be able to use the discovery process and the judicial process to get inquiry, to get depositions, to get discovery into what they have been up to.
[02:51:03.842 --> 02:51:06.544]  Well, I only talked to you for the first time like a week ago on air.
[02:51:06.544 --> 02:51:11.308]  We had dinner last night, but for me it was like an epiphany a month ago what you'd already learned from experience.
[02:51:12.148 --> 02:51:27.434]  is I went oh my god what they're accusing me of is what they're all doing and it was very comforting not in a good way because that was before like what are they that dumb no they literally are operating like I'm them and then I had understanding of them and since that happened it's been like incredible
[02:51:27.714 --> 02:51:28.335]  Absolutely.
[02:51:28.335 --> 02:51:43.276]  And what it does is these open the door to sort of powerful tools like otherwise it would be difficult to say there's even the right to subpoena various government connected individuals and entities to what they've been up to because many of the things that have been predicted and forecast that by InfoWars over time has proven to be accurate.
[02:51:43.496 --> 02:51:47.761]  We found that out with iPhone and it's ability to use FaceTime to spy on people just yesterday.
[02:51:47.761 --> 02:51:48.782]  EU army?
[02:51:48.782 --> 02:51:49.122]  Exactly.
[02:51:49.122 --> 02:51:50.984]  Things that you were talking about many years ago.
[02:51:50.984 --> 02:51:54.528]  Well this affords the opport- they're trying to pretend that nothing you ever said was accurate.
[02:51:54.528 --> 02:51:56.511]  This affords the opportunity to present it to a jury.
[02:51:56.511 --> 02:51:59.013]  So their prosecution is everything you ever said was false?
[02:51:59.013 --> 02:52:00.355]  Well let's show them a hundred things that happened.
[02:52:00.555 --> 02:52:01.015]  Exactly.
[02:52:01.015 --> 02:52:01.996]  Let's prove that it's true.
[02:52:01.996 --> 02:52:11.704]  And let's use the powerful tool of the judicial discovery process that they're trying to do to invade your privacy to actually inquire into relevant factual material information about what they've been up to.
[02:52:11.704 --> 02:52:20.732]  I mean, about the scope of, you know, Tony Podesta's involvement in everything that's related to the Mueller investigation and inquiry that you, they're suggesting some aspects of that are inaccurate.
[02:52:20.732 --> 02:52:24.135]  Well, then let's sit down Tony Podesta and do a full two-day, three-day deposition.
[02:52:24.435 --> 02:52:25.696]  And let's see what the facts are.
[02:52:25.696 --> 02:52:28.117]  By the way, I'd love to say I'm an originator of most stuff.
[02:52:28.117 --> 02:52:30.779]  The New York Times wasn't as bad as they are now 10 years ago.
[02:52:30.779 --> 02:52:34.662]  2005, they had Hillary Clinton's Russian problem.
[02:52:34.662 --> 02:52:37.623]  And it was all about this deal and the FBI being shut down.
[02:52:37.623 --> 02:52:38.144]  Correct.
[02:52:38.144 --> 02:52:43.127]  And really, because they're saying that those accusations are fake, well then this is an opportunity to discover the facts.
[02:52:43.467 --> 02:52:49.848]  Let's do, I mean I had a case where what I kept saying throughout the case was the very first witness I was going to call was Hillary Clinton and the second was going to be Bill Clinton.
[02:52:49.848 --> 02:52:57.010]  And ultimately we got a good outcome in that case because everybody in the system was desperate to avoid those people ever being, having to testify.
[02:52:57.010 --> 02:52:57.690]  But you're right.
[02:52:57.690 --> 02:52:59.410]  They brought all these people in.
[02:52:59.410 --> 02:53:01.031]  They did it, not us.
[02:53:01.031 --> 02:53:01.631]  Exactly.
[02:53:01.631 --> 02:53:02.831]  It's their accusation.
[02:53:02.831 --> 02:53:11.493]  Their accusation is don't believe anything Infowars has ever talked about simply because we want to controversialize and improperly describe what happened related to Sandy Hook.
[02:53:11.833 --> 02:53:13.434]  They don't want to talk about the Podestas.
[02:53:13.434 --> 02:53:16.796]  They don't want to talk about all of these other scandals that other people have been involved in.
[02:53:16.796 --> 02:53:20.798]  The various dark arts that David Brock has been involved in for a long time.
[02:53:20.798 --> 02:53:22.078]  They don't want that put under scrutiny.
[02:53:22.078 --> 02:53:25.780]  But they've invited that scrutiny by claiming that all of those statements are inaccurate.
[02:53:25.780 --> 02:53:27.341]  That all of those claims are inaccurate.
[02:53:27.341 --> 02:53:28.522]  Well, I'm not Machiavelli.
[02:53:29.608 --> 02:53:40.402]  And I'm not trying to put a person on a pig here, but I can see what you're saying now that they have brought all this out and done all this, that what are they going to do when they actually get challenged at all these points?
[02:53:40.402 --> 02:53:41.443]  Exactly.
[02:53:41.443 --> 02:53:44.968]  If they want to prove that all of these things are fake and false, let's put it to the test.
[02:53:45.228 --> 02:53:46.568]  Let's put it to the evidentiary test.
[02:53:46.568 --> 02:53:48.049]  Let's put it to the discovery test.
[02:53:48.049 --> 02:53:49.629]  Let's put it to the deposition test.
[02:53:49.629 --> 02:53:57.131]  They can all swear and let an ordinary jury of 12 ordinary everyday people who aren't fans of the show or critics of the show decide what the truth is.
[02:53:57.131 --> 02:53:58.672]  Let's put it all out there.
[02:53:58.672 --> 02:54:00.612]  Everything that has nothing to do with Sandy Hook.
[02:54:00.612 --> 02:54:03.833]  But exactly how they put it all on trial using the dead children.
[02:54:03.833 --> 02:54:04.073]  Correct.
[02:54:04.073 --> 02:54:05.814]  Because they're the ones using the kids, not me.
[02:54:05.814 --> 02:54:06.054]  Correct.
[02:54:06.054 --> 02:54:09.615]  They want to talk about this marginal little piece where they're misrepresenting what happened.
[02:54:10.015 --> 02:54:12.877]  What, but they're the ones who are saying everything else that does nothing to you.
[02:54:12.877 --> 02:54:15.699]  Well, they're also saying I got famous off Sandy Hook and it's this big thing.
[02:54:15.699 --> 02:54:20.383]  No, they're the ones using my name and Sandy Hook to keep bringing it back up and then saying I'm doing it.
[02:54:20.383 --> 02:54:20.603]  Correct.
[02:54:20.603 --> 02:54:28.429]  The reality is that none of the names of any individual family member would have been known but for the suit and but for the publicity relating to the suit because InfoWars had nothing to do with it.
[02:54:28.429 --> 02:54:32.172]  But what they really want to do is scandalize everything else that has nothing to do with Sandy Hook.
[02:54:32.432 --> 02:54:40.122]  They want people to say, only look here, don't look at all of the other places where accurate information was disclosed, where questions were critically asked that needed to be asked.
[02:54:40.122 --> 02:54:41.183]  Well, imagine showing a jury.
[02:54:42.352 --> 02:54:55.257]  Babies being thrown into incubators, brains bashed out, and then ABC News admitting it was fake, and launching a war that killed millions, or all these declassified examples of mass events that didn't happen, and then saying, we're not supposed to question it?
[02:54:55.257 --> 02:54:55.598]  Exactly.
[02:54:55.598 --> 02:55:04.421]  Think if there had been an InfoWars in the 1950s, who would have exposed that Harvard was connected to an MKUltra project, doing experiments, psychological experiments, on young college students.
[02:55:04.421 --> 02:55:06.302]  Because one of those young college students was Ted Kaczynski.
[02:55:06.682 --> 02:55:08.763]  Maybe Ted Kaczynski doesn't become the Unabomber.
[02:55:08.763 --> 02:55:10.003]  Maybe that never happens.
[02:55:10.003 --> 02:55:15.225]  So the reality is exposing government misconduct and bad deeds by those in power usually ends up saving lives.
[02:55:15.225 --> 02:55:15.885]  Or Tuskegee.
[02:55:15.885 --> 02:55:22.327]  Imagine if Smiley in the 50s said when it first started they're secretly injecting black people with syphilis to spread it to kill black people.
[02:55:22.327 --> 02:55:24.027]  No one would believe it.
[02:55:24.027 --> 02:55:25.128]  Later it was proven right.
[02:55:25.128 --> 02:55:25.688]  Absolutely.
[02:55:25.888 --> 02:55:34.997]  We talk about in terms of the involvement, like now on Snowfall, a show that's a popular show on mainstream media, talks about the CIA's role with crack cocaine and the drug distribution in inner cities.
[02:55:34.997 --> 02:55:37.559]  The reality is, but the reporter who covered that ended up dead.
[02:55:37.559 --> 02:55:38.180]  Very well.
[02:55:38.180 --> 02:55:38.620]  Exactly.
[02:55:38.620 --> 02:55:40.041]  So what if that had been covered?
[02:55:40.041 --> 02:55:41.403]  What if InfoWars had been around?
[02:55:41.403 --> 02:55:42.964]  Well, they called him a kook and a nut.
[02:55:42.964 --> 02:55:43.725]  He never backed down.
[02:55:43.725 --> 02:55:44.646]  He was proven right.
[02:55:44.646 --> 02:55:45.186]  Exactly.
[02:55:45.186 --> 02:55:46.808]  But they demonized him in the process.
[02:55:46.808 --> 02:55:47.448]  They destroyed him.
[02:55:47.448 --> 02:55:48.550]  I talked to him two weeks before he died.
[02:55:49.150 --> 02:55:51.591]  He said, I'm moving, I've got all the proof, my new book's coming out.
[02:55:51.591 --> 02:55:55.753]  He sent us a disc that's somewhere around here that was like all his reportage.
[02:55:55.753 --> 02:55:58.974]  He wanted me to build him a new website and he was dead.
[02:55:58.974 --> 02:56:00.075]  Two gunshots to the head.
[02:56:00.075 --> 02:56:01.255]  They said I was totally normal.
[02:56:01.255 --> 02:56:01.936]  Exactly.
[02:56:01.936 --> 02:56:07.858]  I mean, that's why it's critical that we have dissident outsider voices raising questions about establishment press and establishment power.
[02:56:07.858 --> 02:56:09.559]  Because otherwise the truth never comes out.
[02:56:09.559 --> 02:56:11.320]  That doesn't mean you're going to have a perfect track record.
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:13.041]  That doesn't mean everything's going to be accurate.
[02:56:13.041 --> 02:56:13.941]  But we need those questions.
[02:56:13.941 --> 02:56:15.722]  But I'm not trying to come on here and lie.
[02:56:16.022 --> 02:56:17.344]  Exactly, and that's clear.
[02:56:17.344 --> 02:56:18.685]  It's what they're doing.
[02:56:18.685 --> 02:56:24.932]  They go in every day planning to lie about people, planning to lie about President Trump, planning to lie about the kind of people who support him.
[02:56:24.932 --> 02:56:28.155]  So they project that onto all of their critics and dissidents.
[02:56:28.155 --> 02:56:30.758]  They project that onto everybody raising questions about them.
[02:56:31.178 --> 02:56:38.745]  Clearly, people in the political right have cared more about accuracy, honesty, and truth than anybody in the establishment press has for a very, very long time.
[02:56:46.851 --> 02:56:47.452]  Unicorns.
[02:56:47.452 --> 02:56:48.453]  It just isn't there.
[02:56:48.453 --> 02:56:49.714]  They don't get it.
[02:56:49.714 --> 02:56:50.935]  They don't realize it at all.
[02:56:50.935 --> 02:56:52.556]  They've bought their own lie.
[02:56:52.556 --> 02:56:53.237]  They've fed a lie.
[02:56:53.237 --> 02:56:54.478]  It's like the old joke about a salesman.
[02:56:54.478 --> 02:56:56.119]  They have a tendency to buy their own ad.
[02:56:56.119 --> 02:57:00.743]  The left has bought their own lie in this case, but that's the advantage that it potentially affords you.
[02:57:00.743 --> 02:57:02.364]  It affords you to prove the truth.
[02:57:02.364 --> 02:57:06.267]  A lot of allegations have nothing to do with Sandy Hook that they're now saying are not accurate.
[02:57:06.267 --> 02:57:11.051]  You get to prove the accuracy of by having very important and influential people have to swear under oath to what happened.
[02:57:11.051 --> 02:57:11.551]  We come back.
[02:57:11.551 --> 02:57:13.133]  You've looked at my Virginia case too.
[02:57:13.133 --> 02:57:15.855]  I'm being sued for saying that Soros funded Antifa.
[02:57:16.235 --> 02:57:19.898]  The police stood down, they attacked the right-wing group, most of them feds, it's been admitted.
[02:57:19.898 --> 02:57:23.582]  So Soros, it's his fault for the melee that killed the woman.
[02:57:23.582 --> 02:57:28.226]  They then sue me, saying that I say a photographer that was there killed the woman.
[02:57:28.226 --> 02:57:29.587]  I never even said that!
[02:57:29.587 --> 02:57:31.789]  Never even said his name!
[02:57:31.789 --> 02:57:34.472]  But again, what is the endgame of this?
[02:57:34.472 --> 02:57:35.112]  It's incredible.
[02:57:35.112 --> 02:57:36.714]  We'll be right back in two minutes.
[02:57:36.714 --> 02:57:40.917]  Final segment with Robert Barnes at Barnes underscore Law on Twitter.
[02:57:40.917 --> 02:57:42.519]  BarnesLawLLP.com.
[02:57:47.881 --> 02:57:50.923]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:57:50.923 --> 02:57:57.368]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[02:57:57.368 --> 02:58:12.840]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[02:58:12.840 --> 02:58:16.583]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!

[02:58:26.426 --> 02:58:32.851]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[02:58:32.851 --> 02:58:34.852]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[02:58:34.852 --> 02:58:37.695]  Perk up with TurboForce at Infowarestore.com.
[02:58:46.360 --> 02:58:50.621]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:58:50.621 --> 02:58:54.082]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:58:54.082 --> 02:58:55.842]  Yeah, some of them were like little side accounts.
[02:58:55.842 --> 02:58:59.103]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:58:59.103 --> 02:59:05.904]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:59:05.904 --> 02:59:10.985]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[02:59:11.425 --> 02:59:17.430]  The globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:17.430 --> 02:59:20.413]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:59:20.413 --> 02:59:21.514]  I want to keep going.
[02:59:21.514 --> 02:59:25.337]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:25.337 --> 02:59:27.358]  I want to push all the way.
[02:59:27.358 --> 02:59:28.659]  I've committed to do that.
[02:59:28.659 --> 02:59:31.382]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:59:31.382 --> 02:59:33.804]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:59:34.284 --> 02:59:35.425]  I will never falter.
[02:59:35.425 --> 02:59:37.947]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:59:37.947 --> 02:59:38.887]  I physically will.
[02:59:38.887 --> 02:59:49.195]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, and fullrestore.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:59:49.195 --> 02:59:51.816]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:02.995 --> 03:00:08.927]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:11.713 --> 03:00:15.495]  Robert Barnes is in fuego on air, but he's really volcanic off air.
[03:00:15.495 --> 03:00:22.479]  So repeat what you just said in that last break to viewers about just the whole attack on InfoWars and what it shows, the real opportunities we've got.
[03:00:22.479 --> 03:00:32.624]  Because they have put the entire InfoWars business model at issue and because they're challenging and contesting literally everything that has ever been said that's come out of the studio, they're affording you the opportunity to verify and prove those things.
[03:00:32.984 --> 03:00:51.077]  They're affording, so for example, people like John Podesta, people like Tony Podesta, people like David Brock, who have never been meaningfully deposed in a lot of different cases about various issues and allegations concerning their misconduct and malfeasance over the years, various lobbying issues, various personal issues, various issues of allegations that have been raised concerning them.
[03:00:51.737 --> 03:00:53.599]  Let's have the opportunity to fully vet those.
[03:00:53.599 --> 03:00:54.760]  Let's issue subpoenas.
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:01:03.709]  They're affording you the opportunity to subpoena them for the purposes of deposition, for the purposes of discovery, to prove that the media wants to say that everything InfoWars has ever said is false.
[03:01:03.709 --> 03:01:10.375]  Prove the opportunity to present to a jury the evidence that proves that many of the accusations, none of which have anything to do with Sandy Hook, are in fact true and accurate.
[03:01:10.675 --> 03:01:11.576]  None of that has happened.
[03:01:33.853 --> 03:01:35.615]  It is what happened to the people in Covington.
[03:01:35.615 --> 03:01:37.377]  Totally different, radically different case.
[03:01:37.377 --> 03:01:42.463]  So somebody has a political agenda, but their political agenda is to suppress the audience's right to hear your voice.
[03:01:42.463 --> 03:01:50.713]  And as part of that, they've opened the door to discovery into their behavior, into their email, into their financial activity, into their business activity.
[03:01:50.713 --> 03:01:51.734]  Who's been funding what?
[03:01:52.094 --> 03:01:53.294]  Look at the Stormy Daniels case.
[03:01:53.294 --> 03:01:57.436]  Stormy Daniels had to pay a huge amount to Trump as part of anti-slap fees.
[03:01:57.436 --> 03:02:08.560]  Were these individuals who were brought in to file the claim, were they promised that they would be indemnified against any anti-slap fees that they may have to owe or have to pay, given that their individual names had never been liable or defamed?
[03:02:08.980 --> 03:02:10.201]  So that will be part of the case.
[03:02:10.201 --> 03:02:13.183]  So they've opened the door to get into who is really behind this.
[03:02:13.183 --> 03:02:14.824]  Who's really waging the lawfare?
[03:02:14.824 --> 03:02:20.408]  Who's really trying to misuse the legal system to propagate a political agenda and suppress dissident voices?
[03:02:20.408 --> 03:02:38.060]  And let's get into the verifiable facts, the evidence-supported facts, concerning the various kind of malfeasance and misfeasance that has taken place by privileged people in power for a long time, connected to sort of the Clinton cabal, but also connected to other institutional players who want to suppress and censor speech through shaming individuals that are dissident in that speech.
[03:02:39.120 --> 03:02:50.964]  So, do you think these law firms, which they basically admit are being funded by the Democratic Party, didn't get that by trying to make this the crucifixion of independent media, that they would then draw in all the things we were talking about?
[03:02:50.964 --> 03:02:54.785]  Because, I mean, if you really pull back from it, what they're doing is pretty breathtaking.
[03:02:54.785 --> 03:02:59.227]  Every lawyer that looks at it says, this is the crappiest made-up thing we've ever seen.
[03:02:59.227 --> 03:03:03.368]  Most of it is defamatory against me, but I guess it's in a court document, so they think it's safe.
[03:03:03.988 --> 03:03:11.016]  And generally, you do have a certain court legal privilege, sort of like the legislative privilege, so you can't be sued for defamation or libel.
[03:03:11.016 --> 03:03:12.497]  But what they've done is they've opened the door.
[03:03:12.497 --> 03:03:16.782]  They've said that all the accusations that ever concerned the Podestas were inaccurate, effectively.
[03:03:16.782 --> 03:03:18.223]  That's often what's in the complaint.
[03:03:18.223 --> 03:03:19.925]  That takes up 40 paragraphs.
[03:03:19.925 --> 03:03:24.470]  What's fascinating about the legal complaint is how little of it has anything to do with the individuals who are bringing the claim.
[03:03:24.910 --> 03:03:27.653]  It's not about Sandy Hook, it's about pedophilia doesn't exist.
[03:03:27.653 --> 03:03:27.953]  Correct.
[03:03:27.953 --> 03:03:31.136]  It's about that none of these bad people have ever done anything bad in their lives.
[03:03:31.136 --> 03:03:36.882]  It's like, why are they going on and on about the various, the weird emails that WikiLeaks exposed concerning the pedestrians?
[03:03:36.882 --> 03:03:38.063]  Why do they go into that?
[03:03:38.063 --> 03:03:39.465]  It's like, that has nothing to do with Sandy Hook.
[03:03:39.465 --> 03:03:40.366]  Why are they discussing that?
[03:03:40.706 --> 03:03:55.356]  So it seems odd, seems peculiar, and what they're trying to do is say every accusation, every allegation ever made by Infowars... What they're saying is, if you talk about Aleister Crowley, and spirit cooking, and Bill Maher, and kid love, we're gonna sue you.
[03:03:55.356 --> 03:03:55.856]  Right.
[03:03:55.856 --> 03:04:03.041]  If you get into anything that embarrasses people in privilege and power, then they're going to try to silence and censor and shame that speech.
[03:04:03.041 --> 03:04:05.082]  And that appears to be what the real objective is.
[03:04:05.082 --> 03:04:09.305]  But instead, this could become like the big bug zapper, or the lace target, politically.
[03:04:09.305 --> 03:04:10.306]  They've opened it up now.
[03:04:11.066 --> 03:04:13.888]  I had a gut feeling about a month ago, I was thinking about this.
[03:04:13.888 --> 03:04:15.749]  I think this is their waterloo now.
[03:04:15.749 --> 03:04:17.590]  I think they've actually stuck their foot in it.
[03:04:17.590 --> 03:04:20.292]  I don't say that as some confidence game here.
[03:04:20.292 --> 03:04:23.414]  I think it's over for them in a lot of respects.
[03:04:23.414 --> 03:04:24.875]  They've opened a door that they didn't realize.
[03:04:24.875 --> 03:04:36.682]  They bought into their own nonsense and their own sort of caricatured portrait of who you were and in the process they ignored the real evidence and the real evidence implicates a lot of bad actors and a lot of positions of privilege and power that need to be exposed for what they've done.
[03:04:37.342 --> 03:04:39.224]  Robert Barnes, attorney at law.
[03:04:39.224 --> 03:04:40.565]  We're gonna take a little 60-second break.
[03:04:40.565 --> 03:04:41.626]  I'm out with Roger Stone.
[03:04:41.626 --> 03:04:49.213]  Give you a chance to let you get some well-served lunch to talk about your view on the whole Russiagate canard and what you witnessed there and so much more.
[03:04:49.213 --> 03:04:49.614]  Stay with us.
[03:04:56.892 --> 03:04:59.913]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:04:59.913 --> 03:05:06.356]  While coffee, candy and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[03:06:03.124 --> 03:06:03.308]  Yeah.
[03:06:41.576 --> 03:06:42.056]  I'm 17.
[03:06:42.056 --> 03:06:42.417]  I'm 76.
[03:06:42.417 --> 03:06:44.597]  You're a white male!
[03:06:44.597 --> 03:06:49.879]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[03:06:49.879 --> 03:06:51.080]  Move, bitch!
[03:06:51.080 --> 03:06:54.161]  Get out the way!
[03:06:54.161 --> 03:06:57.202]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag
[03:06:58.402 --> 03:07:00.122]  It's the American plan!
[03:07:00.122 --> 03:07:04.483]  InfoWars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[03:07:04.483 --> 03:07:08.044]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[03:07:08.044 --> 03:07:09.504]  I will not let you down.
[03:07:09.504 --> 03:07:12.645]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:07:12.645 --> 03:07:14.225]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:07:14.225 --> 03:07:16.366]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:07:16.366 --> 03:07:21.907]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[03:07:21.907 --> 03:07:24.608]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:07:24.608 --> 03:07:25.608]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:07:28.510 --> 03:07:29.191]  Another world.
[03:07:29.191 --> 03:07:30.933]  Another time.
[03:07:30.933 --> 03:07:33.235]  Another world.
[03:07:33.235 --> 03:07:35.678]  Another time.
[03:07:35.678 --> 03:07:37.720]  Another time.
[03:07:37.720 --> 03:07:40.023]  In the age of wonder.
[03:07:40.023 --> 03:07:41.644]  In the age of wonder.
[03:07:52.458 --> 03:07:55.202]  We want to hear the crystal fact.
[03:07:55.202 --> 03:07:59.848]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:07:59.848 --> 03:08:02.152]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[03:08:02.152 --> 03:08:04.575]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[03:08:04.575 --> 03:08:06.497]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:06.497 --> 03:08:07.379]  I gotta be honest.
[03:08:08.912 --> 03:08:10.313]  I get tired from work.
[03:08:10.313 --> 03:08:11.773]  Everything else, I'm usually bored at dinner.
[03:08:11.773 --> 03:08:13.734]  Even when I'm talking to really smart people.
[03:08:13.734 --> 03:08:20.456]  But Robert Barnes last night, I was like, man, this guy on every angle, because I've played a lot of history, a lot of politics, on every topic.
[03:08:20.456 --> 03:08:22.457]  I bring up different people, different topics.
[03:08:22.457 --> 03:08:26.218]  And he had like the inside baseball from my own research, but then a little bit more.
[03:08:26.218 --> 03:08:26.898]  I was impressed.
[03:08:26.898 --> 03:08:30.379]  So we're going to be hearing a lot more from Robert Barnes here on air if he'll do it.
[03:08:30.379 --> 03:08:31.900]  I know he's a busy guy.
[03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:35.421]  He obviously is representing some of the Covington kids and doing a great job.
[03:08:35.421 --> 03:08:37.182]  He's represented Wesley Snipes and so many others.
[03:08:37.182 --> 03:08:37.682]  He's here with us.
[03:08:38.422 --> 03:08:40.706]  But he's been on for almost two hours.
[03:08:40.706 --> 03:08:44.091]  But we were talking about Roger's case last night and Rush again, his view on that.
[03:08:44.091 --> 03:08:46.815]  So Roger Stone from D.C.
[03:08:46.815 --> 03:08:47.255]  indicted.
[03:08:48.510 --> 03:08:50.912]  Last week, a rained Monday.
[03:08:50.912 --> 03:08:54.014]  Owen Schroeder, they're covering it live.
[03:08:54.014 --> 03:09:02.080]  I wanted to get your take on Russiagate, where you think it's going, and your big insight into Robert Mueller, who I've done research on that nobody had this research.
[03:09:02.080 --> 03:09:11.386]  Like, you've done the research, and I'm actually related to his wife, which is not a good thing, I guess, going back to the Mayflower, but I guess we're like 20th cousins or something.
[03:09:11.386 --> 03:09:13.347]  But I'm not related to him, though.
[03:09:13.347 --> 03:09:16.790]  I've done the family tree, but it's definitely some blue blood activity going on.
[03:09:17.390 --> 03:09:17.890]  Oh, no doubt.
[03:09:17.890 --> 03:09:26.475]  Manafort goes, I mean, I mean, the whole, all of the prosecutions, the Moore's family goes all the way back to old money, old establishment money, back to New Amsterdam when New York was New Amsterdam.
[03:09:26.475 --> 03:09:28.897]  You know, the Princeton dining clubs, that whole environment.
[03:09:28.897 --> 03:09:32.879]  There's a guy who has a very peculiar legal history from a political perspective.
[03:09:32.879 --> 03:09:36.781]  Somebody who's he's sort of the deep state fixed man for the better part of three decades.
[03:09:36.781 --> 03:09:40.323]  A guy who's part of weird prosecutions that go in unusual ways.
[03:09:40.323 --> 03:09:43.205]  So, I mean, here's a guy who was one of the top people for Bush.
[03:09:43.345 --> 03:09:51.914]  In the early 90s, then he leaves, cashes in, makes a couple of million, then he goes and becomes a mid-level homicide prosecutor in the District of Columbia, which is a weird transition.
[03:09:51.914 --> 03:09:53.715]  You just don't see that in normal resumes.
[03:09:53.715 --> 03:10:00.802]  And then, all of a sudden, Bill Clinton, after he's there at a key, after Mueller's there for a key several year juncture, suddenly Mueller gets one of the prime gigs.
[03:10:00.802 --> 03:10:05.247]  Here's a Republican getting a prime gig as the Northern District of California head prosecutor.
[03:10:05.467 --> 03:10:07.769]  Something every liberal Democrat in the country wanted.
[03:10:07.769 --> 03:10:09.250]  So the question is, how does that happen?
[03:10:09.250 --> 03:10:10.331]  How does he go from the D.C.
[03:10:10.331 --> 03:10:15.075]  Homicide Unit to being the United States Attorney in the Northern District of California?
[03:10:15.075 --> 03:10:18.879]  Then he handles the Asimov case, who is the son of the famous science fiction writer.
[03:10:18.879 --> 03:10:21.321]  A lot of peculiar things happen connected to that case.
[03:10:21.321 --> 03:10:25.845]  Not long after that, all of a sudden, he has a sweetheart gig back as the Director of the FBI.
[03:10:25.845 --> 03:10:27.246]  A lot of peculiar things happen then.
[03:10:27.606 --> 03:10:31.449]  I mean, you look at HSBC, BCCI, the Noriega case.
[03:10:31.449 --> 03:10:37.495]  You look at the various high-profile pedophile or the Epstein case, other high-profile cases.
[03:10:37.495 --> 03:10:38.576]  Somehow Mueller shows up.
[03:10:38.576 --> 03:10:40.077]  You look up at Whitey Bulger.
[03:10:40.077 --> 03:10:43.840]  You know, here Mueller is up in Boston while they're covering up for the bad activities of Whitey Bulger.
[03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:44.481]  How does that happen?
[03:10:44.781 --> 03:10:49.022]  How does this guy end up like Peter Sellers in that movie where he keeps showing up randomly?
[03:10:49.022 --> 03:10:50.543]  I was about to interrupt you.
[03:10:50.543 --> 03:10:55.064]  It's like in some movie where the devil always appears in a poof of smoke at the perfect time.
[03:10:55.064 --> 03:10:57.685]  It's like only one other guy, Donald Rumsfeld, does that.
[03:10:57.685 --> 03:10:58.745]  But Mueller, it's even worse.
[03:10:58.745 --> 03:11:01.926]  He like... and then pops back in at key points.
[03:11:01.926 --> 03:11:02.306]  Correct.
[03:11:02.306 --> 03:11:03.406]  And it's always the cover-up.
[03:11:03.406 --> 03:11:08.348]  I mean, both HSBC and BCCI were heavily involved in accusing... If something's threatening the deep state...
[03:11:09.008 --> 03:11:11.891]  Bob Mueller is the fix-it man.
[03:11:11.891 --> 03:11:12.611]  That's who he's been.
[03:11:12.611 --> 03:11:22.501]  He always looks for sin goats and sacrifice offerings to satisfy and to protect the actual corruption that's institutional and runs deep within high-ranking positions within the hierarchy of law enforcement.
[03:11:22.501 --> 03:11:25.143]  And his final sin goat is Roger Stone.
[03:11:25.143 --> 03:11:25.583]  Absolutely.
[03:11:25.583 --> 03:11:26.504]  There's no doubt.
[03:11:26.504 --> 03:11:28.886]  Counselor, it's your chance, because we talked about Roger a lot last night.
[03:11:28.886 --> 03:11:31.769]  Roger, give us the latest developments, but meet Robert Barnes.
[03:11:31.769 --> 03:11:32.450]  He's pretty amazing.
[03:11:33.716 --> 03:11:40.122]  I've been listening, and I must say, Counselor, I'm very impressed with the depth of your knowledge of both law and history.
[03:11:40.122 --> 03:11:43.205]  So it's an honor for me to be on with you.
[03:11:43.205 --> 03:11:45.987]  You're looking at Mr. Mueller's latest target.
[03:11:45.987 --> 03:11:54.455]  Now, it's said that a federal prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich, but I'm really not all that interested in being Mr. Mueller's lunch.
[03:11:56.195 --> 03:11:58.917]  This has been an extraordinary odyssey.
[03:11:58.917 --> 03:12:00.037]  It's almost surreal.
[03:12:00.037 --> 03:12:15.948]  I keep thinking it's a nightmare from which I will wake up after my arraignment yesterday, looking over at the prosecution table, seeing two former aides and attorneys who worked for Hillary Clinton.
[03:12:17.409 --> 03:12:23.493]  You know, the political bias in my prosecution is extraordinary.
[03:12:23.493 --> 03:12:27.315]  I mean, it needs to be brought to the attention of the court.
[03:12:27.315 --> 03:12:42.185]  I am assigned to a judge who was in the Manafort case, who rejected all of the legal arguments regarding the constitutionality of Mr. Mueller's appointment, his involvement in Uranium One and other issues.
[03:12:43.566 --> 03:12:56.424]  The scene outside the courthouse, however, was almost as bad as what I saw inside the courthouse in the sense that I have never seen a torrent of hate
[03:12:57.336 --> 03:13:05.904]  Well, the reason I kept Mr. Barnes here is he's really worried about you and all your lawyers are great, he thinks they're great.
[03:13:05.904 --> 03:13:17.554]  He's been following and reading the cases and he said, doesn't he know, and you know this lady gags people, she shuts them down, and he was just surprised that up front that wasn't the main issue made in front of the magistrate.
[03:13:17.554 --> 03:13:17.994]  You want to comment?
[03:13:18.254 --> 03:13:19.195]  Yeah, I mean, I was surprised.
[03:13:19.195 --> 03:13:21.897]  I mean, your lawyers are always in the position they're doing a very good job.
[03:13:21.897 --> 03:13:39.270]  But basically, it appears to me that Mueller has somehow coordinated a way in which the same judge who handled the Manafort case, the same judge who helped, was involved in efforts to misuse and abuse bail provisions to deal with Gates related to that case, where she prevented him from fundraising and other activity, a judge who's made very peculiar ruling.
[03:13:39.270 --> 03:13:42.292]  Basically, she's been nothing more than... How does a judge say you can't pay for your defense?
[03:13:42.692 --> 03:13:44.233]  I mean, effectively, that's what she did.
[03:13:44.233 --> 03:13:46.695]  And not only that, but she did things that were basically a rubber stamp.
[03:13:46.695 --> 03:13:50.838]  It was the old Earl Long joke about Huey Long.
[03:13:50.838 --> 03:13:53.920]  Somebody blew a leaf across his desk and he signed it.
[03:13:53.920 --> 03:13:59.364]  There's aspects of this judge that whatever Mueller has blown across her desk that she signs even when it's not based on good law.
[03:13:59.364 --> 03:14:01.045]  So is this judge compromised?
[03:14:01.045 --> 03:14:04.608]  I think it's a judge who just is reflexively pro-government and won't be independent.
[03:14:04.608 --> 03:14:05.869]  And I think that's the concern.
[03:14:07.062 --> 03:14:27.841]  Well, in all honesty, the reason that they were able to judge shop in this case is by connecting my case to the case of the 17 Russian intelligence agents in which I was mentioned, although not accused of doing anything wrong because of an innocuous communication, a benign communication, with Guccifer 2.0.
[03:14:27.841 --> 03:14:32.766]  So by connecting the two cases, they have judge shopped for this case.
[03:14:33.246 --> 03:14:37.729]  That's a question for my lawyers to address in due time.
[03:14:37.729 --> 03:14:43.332]  I imagine that I have not, there's not been a motion by the government to gag me yet, but I assume there will be.
[03:14:46.479 --> 03:14:50.805]  I have certainly, I don't know what you would call the last 24 hours, but I've not exactly been a freaking pilot.
[03:15:06.098 --> 03:15:11.321]  You know, and obviously Manafort did not appeal the gag rule put on him.
[03:15:11.321 --> 03:15:14.703]  To a higher court, he did not object.
[03:15:14.703 --> 03:15:17.045]  He also mounted no public defense.
[03:15:17.045 --> 03:15:30.853]  I generally think that when a person is accused of wrongdoing in public and they don't respond, they don't say, I'm not guilty, I'm innocent, I plead innocent, and mount a defense, people assume, well, that guy's guilty.
[03:15:30.853 --> 03:15:31.573]  He was unavailable.
[03:15:31.573 --> 03:15:33.695]  Well, let's do one more segment, Roger, and you'll take over.
[03:15:34.255 --> 03:15:35.597]  I want to ask the question.
[03:15:35.597 --> 03:15:37.839]  Is Mueller really winding this down?
[03:15:37.839 --> 03:15:41.223]  And is Roger Stone the cherry on top?
[03:15:41.223 --> 03:15:45.328]  The coup de gras, the final dish, the cognac at the end of a long meal?
[03:15:45.328 --> 03:15:46.369]  We'll find out.
[03:15:46.369 --> 03:15:48.171]  My gut tells me they've just begun.
[03:15:48.171 --> 03:15:51.555]  They're going to wrap up Russiagate, but launch a bunch of new fake investigations.
[03:15:53.280 --> 03:15:57.043]  You may need this herbal tea for relief right away, so write this down.

[03:16:23.044 --> 03:16:29.409]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.409 --> 03:16:32.451]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.451 --> 03:16:38.376]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.376 --> 03:16:42.159]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.159 --> 03:16:43.440]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.440 --> 03:16:44.781]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.781 --> 03:16:50.986]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[03:18:59.194 --> 03:19:00.834]  There is no un-continuum.

[03:19:10.719 --> 03:19:17.603]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[03:19:17.603 --> 03:19:18.163]  We made it.
[03:19:18.163 --> 03:19:20.324]  And that's really where this goes.
[03:19:20.324 --> 03:19:22.145]  God's got a big war for you, Reddy.
[03:19:22.145 --> 03:19:22.505]  And so,
[03:19:22.705 --> 03:19:29.307]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[03:19:29.307 --> 03:19:34.228]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[03:19:34.228 --> 03:19:37.088]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:19:37.088 --> 03:19:39.489]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:19:39.489 --> 03:19:42.990]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[03:19:42.990 --> 03:19:44.010]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:19:44.270 --> 03:19:48.553]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[03:19:48.553 --> 03:19:51.435]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[03:19:51.435 --> 03:19:52.496]  I want life.
[03:19:52.496 --> 03:19:57.239]  I want Jesus.
[03:19:57.239 --> 03:20:06.345]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:06.345 --> 03:20:10.168]  So if our president can grab a woman by the pussy, I can grab you by the balls.
[03:20:10.168 --> 03:20:11.208]  She just grabbed my dick.
[03:20:11.208 --> 03:20:12.169]  Is that sexual assault?
[03:20:13.351 --> 03:20:14.433]  Is that sexual assault?
[03:20:14.433 --> 03:20:15.135]  Yes.
[03:20:15.135 --> 03:20:16.257]  So you just sexually assaulted me?
[03:20:16.257 --> 03:20:16.758]  I did assault you.
[03:20:16.758 --> 03:20:17.860]  Should you be arrested?
[03:20:17.860 --> 03:20:18.742]  Arrest me?
[03:20:18.742 --> 03:20:19.503]  I'm not gonna arrest you.
[03:20:19.503 --> 03:20:21.287]  There are police officers right here.
[03:20:21.287 --> 03:20:22.008]  So look at this!
[03:20:22.008 --> 03:20:25.134]  Women have so much privilege, she can sexually assault me and get away with it!
[03:20:41.108 --> 03:20:44.689]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[03:20:44.689 --> 03:20:48.810]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:48.810 --> 03:20:50.691]  So, we were talking about these crazy leftists.
[03:20:50.691 --> 03:21:02.795]  I told Owen, a week and a half ago, it was the Women's March, this woman brutally grabbed his crotch, said it hurt pretty bad off-air, he went like a wimp, he's not, that, you know, it was assault, and I said, well, you should tell the police.
[03:21:02.795 --> 03:21:09.417]  Well, turns out they found out his name somehow, they called him, and she's been arrested yesterday.
[03:21:10.297 --> 03:21:11.858]  And Owen got the call today.
[03:21:11.858 --> 03:21:13.178]  He did a video on it.
[03:21:13.178 --> 03:21:15.219]  It's on InfoWars.com breaking.
[03:21:15.219 --> 03:21:20.521]  Liberal woman who grabbed InfoWars host by the crotch and said, I just assaulted you, has been arrested.
[03:21:20.521 --> 03:21:23.922]  And look, in another world, I wouldn't want her arrested for that.
[03:21:23.922 --> 03:21:27.623]  But the fact that she's so arrogant, this is just what she deserves.
[03:21:28.203 --> 03:21:28.763]  Oh, no doubt.
[03:21:28.763 --> 03:21:35.144]  I mean, it shows a double standard, and it shows the sort of reckless rogue conduct of individuals who think they can do anything they want, anytime they want.
[03:21:35.144 --> 03:21:37.165]  People who have a Harvey Weinstein mentality.
[03:21:37.165 --> 03:21:39.865]  It's not a surprise that Harvey Weinstein himself comes from the left.
[03:21:39.865 --> 03:21:43.106]  It's the same mentality, just applied in different contexts.
[03:21:43.106 --> 03:21:52.267]  Roger, what do you make of your co-host, The War Room, having a guy eat his microphone yesterday, and now this woman that assaulted him sexually, she's been arrested?
[03:21:52.267 --> 03:21:56.888]  Well, first he tried to spit on him, and then he tried to eat his microphone.
[03:21:58.584 --> 03:22:03.008]  Alex, this is kind of reminiscent of the scene yesterday outside the U.S.
[03:22:03.008 --> 03:22:04.629]  District Courthouse.
[03:22:04.629 --> 03:22:12.716]  In 50 years in politics, I've never seen this kind of hatred, pushing, shoving, screaming, spitting.
[03:22:12.716 --> 03:22:20.303]  When I got in the car, spittle, completely rolling down the window, people pounding on the car, pounding on the car.
[03:22:20.943 --> 03:22:25.567]  I'm very grateful to the police officers from the D.C.
[03:22:25.567 --> 03:22:31.192]  Metropolitan Police and to the federal marshals who got me out of the building in one piece.
[03:22:31.192 --> 03:22:38.959]  This reminded me of Vice President Richard Nixon in Caracas, people rocking the car before we pulled away.
[03:22:38.959 --> 03:22:42.843]  Thanks to the head of my security team, I got out of there with my skin.
[03:22:43.523 --> 03:22:45.363]  I wanted to make a statement.
[03:22:45.363 --> 03:22:51.885]  There were, you know, 40 microphones out front, but I don't want to be Jack Ruby, to be quite honest with you.
[03:22:51.885 --> 03:22:54.866]  And these people are perfectly capable of it.
[03:22:54.866 --> 03:23:05.428]  I'm also on probation under the supervision of the court, and it's been made very clear that if his eyes so much as spit on the sidewalk, I will be immediately incarcerated.
[03:23:06.228 --> 03:23:09.190]  I'm sure that Mr. Mueller would like nothing better.
[03:23:09.190 --> 03:23:12.753]  So, I've never seen this kind of hatred.
[03:23:12.753 --> 03:23:20.497]  I watched Jared Holt from Right Wing Watch call one of my black supporters a stupid N-word.
[03:23:20.497 --> 03:23:22.579]  Gee, that's real tolerant for you leftists.
[03:23:22.579 --> 03:23:28.022]  I guess you can't fathom the idea of an African American who holds conservative views.
[03:23:28.022 --> 03:23:29.123]  That's not allowed.
[03:23:29.123 --> 03:23:33.426]  Well, what's happened is they've learned they're allowed to say and do things that nobody else can.
[03:23:35.432 --> 03:23:37.854]  It's unlike anything I've ever seen.
[03:23:37.854 --> 03:23:42.819]  Going out to a restaurant here trying to eat, I've basically given up on it.
[03:23:42.819 --> 03:23:59.695]  I'm forced to eat in an undisclosed location in my room because every time I try to go outside to even shoot a video or for fresh air or to even smoke a cigar, God forbid, I'm confronted by some crazed leftist who wants to kill me.
[03:24:00.674 --> 03:24:07.462]  Not just yell, you're a Russian traitor, you're a Russian spy, but people who want actual fisticuffs.
[03:24:07.462 --> 03:24:09.023]  This is where we are in America.
[03:24:09.023 --> 03:24:14.290]  This is what I'm looking for, you know, the time between now and which I go to trial.
[03:24:14.290 --> 03:24:16.873]  So it is only through the help of
[03:24:17.745 --> 03:24:18.686]  All right.
[03:24:37.169 --> 03:24:41.054]  Uh, who's a friend of mine, uh, and who was unfortunately convicted.
[03:24:41.054 --> 03:24:46.160]  I will mount a very vigorous defense because I am not guilty.
[03:24:46.160 --> 03:24:55.431]  And watching Governor Chris Christie, who hasn't read the transcripts of my testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, which comprises five of the seven counts,
[03:24:56.151 --> 03:25:07.681]  And who hasn't read the context of any of the emails which are wildly taken out of context to fabricate this indictment is ready to declare me guilty.
[03:25:07.681 --> 03:25:08.482]  It's a done deal.
[03:25:08.482 --> 03:25:15.047]  I should just plead and maybe even testify against the President, which I'm not going to do.
[03:25:15.047 --> 03:25:17.049]  We know you're not going to do that.
[03:25:17.049 --> 03:25:19.231]  Closing on here before you take over with Robert Barnes.
[03:25:21.952 --> 03:25:24.175]  I mean, I've said, how do we make it about what they're doing?
[03:25:24.175 --> 03:25:29.263]  I can't see how Mueller's involved with Uranium One and the Russians and how they get away with this.
[03:25:29.263 --> 03:25:30.444]  Mueller doesn't want to lose.
[03:25:30.444 --> 03:25:32.507]  How do we let him know he's going to lose?
[03:25:32.507 --> 03:25:35.752]  You were surprised that he went after Roger because it's not a very good case.
[03:25:36.365 --> 03:25:40.567]  No, as a general rule, Mueller generally avoids prosecutions that are losable cases.
[03:25:40.567 --> 03:25:42.868]  He avoids bringing him against certain kinds of lawyers.
[03:25:42.868 --> 03:25:45.209]  He avoids bringing him against certain kind of defendants.
[03:25:45.209 --> 03:25:52.412]  So I think that the fact that they brought this, maybe he just sort of delegated it to the Clinton lawyers that are part of the team that's against Roger.
[03:25:52.412 --> 03:25:53.632]  Maybe that's what's going on.
[03:25:53.632 --> 03:25:56.234]  But I was surprised because it's not a strong case.
[03:25:56.234 --> 03:25:57.774]  This is entirely a process case.
[03:25:57.774 --> 03:26:02.496]  This case would not exist but for Mueller's investigation and the congressional investigation.
[03:26:02.496 --> 03:26:04.197]  The extravagant stretch
[03:26:04.577 --> 03:26:08.838]  To make this an obstruction case is very marginal on its face.
[03:26:08.838 --> 03:26:15.200]  And then the various perjury charges, there's no such thing as really perjury to Congress, frankly, if you've ever heard a congressional question.
[03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:17.441]  Because it's usually got 18 different sub-components.
[03:26:17.441 --> 03:26:19.861]  If this happened, then this happened, then this thing, and then what if you did this?
[03:26:19.861 --> 03:26:25.283]  And so they're interpreting something that's extrapolating from something that's interpreting something else, that they're going to call that perjury?
[03:26:25.283 --> 03:26:28.384]  This makes the Barry Bonds case look like the dream perjury case of all time.
[03:26:28.704 --> 03:26:39.769]  So it's a bad case, it's a weak case, it's only being brought because he thinks he can control who the judge is, and he thinks he can control and have a very liberal jury, and he thinks that that will be enough to railroad Rod.
[03:26:39.769 --> 03:26:48.172]  And it's good to hear that Roger's got a good amount of defense, and a strong defense, but it's a case that really shouldn't have been brought by an ethical, honest prosecutor only pursuing truth.
[03:26:48.172 --> 03:26:52.294]  Do you think Roger is the last hors d'oeuvre?
[03:26:53.553 --> 03:27:00.919]  I think because Democrats took back the House, they think they can transfer this sort of constant inquisition to the Democratic committee members.
[03:27:00.919 --> 03:27:05.723]  And I think people like Adam Schiff and others, they think, can effectively take over from Mueller.
[03:27:05.723 --> 03:27:07.905]  Mueller doesn't like to be in the constant middle of this.
[03:27:07.905 --> 03:27:17.293]  He's done an effective job covering up the various corruption and collusion that took place with the intel agencies during the Obama administration and spying on our first presidential candidate during a campaign.
[03:27:17.293 --> 03:27:21.476]  For all the accusations against Richard Nixon, he never did anything like that and was never accused of doing anything
[03:27:21.476 --> 03:27:21.736]  I don't
[03:27:42.810 --> 03:27:43.130]  We're good to go.
[03:28:08.488 --> 03:28:09.649]  That's what it's all about.
[03:28:09.649 --> 03:28:19.499]  You put Roger under massive macroscopic and microscopic scrutiny and all you come up with is an extrapolation of a perjury claim of a process crime that's weak on its face?
[03:28:19.499 --> 03:28:22.462]  That shows you how weak their claims were and their charges were.
[03:28:22.462 --> 03:28:27.527]  And it was all just done to cover up the collusion and corruption of the institutional operation against President Trump during the campaign.
[03:28:28.507 --> 03:28:29.608]  Infowars.com.
[03:28:29.608 --> 03:28:31.228]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:28:31.228 --> 03:28:33.749]  Roger Stone takes over and then decides in the war room.
[03:28:33.749 --> 03:28:35.070]  3 to 6 p.m.
[03:28:35.070 --> 03:28:40.632]  is coming up with Owen Schroyer, Rob Dew, and others hosting from DC and Austin, Texas.
[03:28:40.632 --> 03:28:41.452]  We'll be right back.

[03:28:47.475 --> 03:28:48.675]  Robert Barnes, thanks for joining us.
[03:28:48.675 --> 03:28:49.455]  It's been amazing.
[03:28:49.455 --> 03:28:50.176]  Absolutely.
[03:28:50.176 --> 03:28:50.496]  Thank you.
[03:28:53.200 --> 03:28:56.801]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:32:41.534 --> 03:32:44.276]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.
[03:32:44.276 --> 03:32:47.938]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[03:32:47.938 --> 03:32:56.702]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:56.702 --> 03:32:59.344]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.788 --> 03:33:24.831]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.831 --> 03:33:31.734]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:31.734 --> 03:33:35.095]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:35.095 --> 03:33:39.677]  I'm broadcasting today from an undisclosed location in D.C.
[03:33:39.677 --> 03:33:45.579]  because if my whereabouts was known, in all honesty, my life would most definitely be in danger.
[03:33:46.639 --> 03:33:52.521]  I want you to understand the vital importance of the InfoWars platform to my defense.
[03:33:52.521 --> 03:34:11.026]  Because it is only a matter of time before the mainstream media wants you to forget all about Roger Stone and the stunning raid on my home last Friday in which they used a larger force than that which was protecting our consulate in Benghazi.
[03:34:11.026 --> 03:34:16.108]  A larger force than was used to go in and capture and kill Bin Laden.
[03:34:17.040 --> 03:34:18.961]  Or Pablo Escobar?
[03:34:18.961 --> 03:34:20.401]  Or El Chapo?
[03:34:20.401 --> 03:34:23.202]  You see, Infowars is the tip of the spear.
[03:34:23.202 --> 03:34:26.323]  We are the beacon of truth, the beacon of freedom.
[03:34:26.323 --> 03:34:37.526]  And this is the only place on the internet, or on cable, or on radio, you'll be able to get the stone-cold truth about what's really going on in my trial.
[03:34:37.526 --> 03:34:39.947]  That's why they want to take Infowars down.
[03:34:39.947 --> 03:34:41.087]  They want to take me down.
[03:34:41.087 --> 03:34:45.909]  They want to incarcerate me, gag me, make sure that I can't defend myself.
[03:34:46.727 --> 03:34:55.070]  But under our Constitution, if you have the right to remain silent, you also have the right to speak in your defense.
[03:34:55.070 --> 03:34:57.431]  And they will try to deprive me of that.
[03:34:57.431 --> 03:34:59.952]  But Owen Schroyer will know the truth.
[03:34:59.952 --> 03:35:02.713]  Alex Jones will know the truth.
[03:35:02.713 --> 03:35:05.474]  David Knight will know the truth.
[03:35:05.474 --> 03:35:07.615]  Rob Doo will know the truth.
[03:35:08.271 --> 03:35:20.668]  Millie Weaver will know the truth, and so many others, Jake Lloyd and others, they will tell you what's going on, which is why it's vitally important for you to support the InfoWars platform.
[03:35:21.397 --> 03:35:33.939]  From the beginning, closing InfoWars down, wiping us off the digital platforms, taking us off Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Spotify, and so on.
[03:35:33.939 --> 03:35:40.601]  The assault on InfoWars by Google, by Apple, this is all part of the plan.
[03:35:40.601 --> 03:35:48.142]  Just as the arrest at my home last Friday, and the efforts to incarcerate me so that I cannot speak,
[03:35:48.642 --> 03:35:49.043]  Yes.
[03:36:06.880 --> 03:36:19.850]  Team of scientists that work with Alex Jones, where we fuse the very best of ancient Asian oriental herbology that's been in existence successfully for two centuries.
[03:36:19.850 --> 03:36:30.699]  And we bind that with some of the cutting edge nutraceutical products that bring you the very best all natural effective products that you can find on the market today.
[03:36:31.849 --> 03:36:36.173]  You can go to Walgreens or CVS or Walmart.
[03:36:36.173 --> 03:36:37.054]  There are others.
[03:36:37.054 --> 03:36:49.205]  There are products at Whole Foods that sound like the products that you can buy at InfoWars, but you will get less in terms of volume and you will get less in terms of quality.
[03:36:49.745 --> 03:36:54.807]  So, please, go to the InfoWars.com site and look at one of our great products.
[03:36:54.807 --> 03:37:04.651]  Whether it's Super Male Vitality, the special Michael Zimmerman formula, or Bodies, the very best turmeric formula, great for people.
[03:37:04.651 --> 03:37:06.231]  My sister's a waitress.
[03:37:06.231 --> 03:37:08.732]  She is on her feet eight hours a day.
[03:37:08.732 --> 03:37:10.313]  She complained constantly.
[03:37:10.313 --> 03:37:12.594]  She was taking mouths full of Advil.
[03:37:12.594 --> 03:37:14.174]  It wasn't doing the trick.
[03:37:14.174 --> 03:37:16.095]  I recommended Bodies.
[03:37:16.095 --> 03:37:18.076]  She says it's the greatest thing she's ever taken.
[03:37:18.596 --> 03:37:20.617]  So, I know this stuff works.
[03:37:20.617 --> 03:37:22.938]  That's a personal testimonial.
[03:37:22.938 --> 03:37:29.740]  And if you're not in the market for one of our great products, find the donate button on the InfoWars site.
[03:37:29.740 --> 03:37:30.700]  Send us $25, $50, $100, $500.
[03:37:30.700 --> 03:37:35.722]  Yes, some InfoWarriors have sent as much as $1,000 because the vibrance and the accessibility
[03:37:43.585 --> 03:37:48.008]  of the InfoWars platform are crucial to my defense.
[03:37:48.008 --> 03:37:52.430]  And then, go over to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:37:52.430 --> 03:37:55.132]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:37:55.132 --> 03:37:58.294]  You gotta be very careful, because there's hucksters out there.
[03:37:58.294 --> 03:38:02.216]  The Roger Stone Legal Defense Fund dot com, that's not me.
[03:38:02.216 --> 03:38:05.118]  The Stone Defense Fund, that's not me.
[03:38:05.118 --> 03:38:08.660]  Pardon me, the Stone Legal Defense Fund, that's not me.
[03:38:08.660 --> 03:38:10.941]  There's two places you can go that are authorized.
[03:38:11.701 --> 03:38:19.603]  StoneDefenseFund.com or WhoFramedRogerStone.com, although we know the answer to that.
[03:38:19.603 --> 03:38:25.964]  You know, I want to shift to what Alex Jones was talking about, because frankly, I'm tired of talking about my own case.
[03:38:25.964 --> 03:38:33.145]  It only brings me back to the stark future of repression that I face.
[03:38:33.145 --> 03:38:41.407]  The real question is, why are they doing this to me while FBI Director James Comey lied under oath?
[03:38:42.091 --> 03:38:51.898]  Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, the de facto Attorney General for the last two years, lied under oath.
[03:38:51.898 --> 03:39:06.448]  FBI Director Christopher Wray lied under oath to the Congress about whether President Trump was the subject of a secret counterintelligence investigation trying to prove that he was an active agent for the Russians.
[03:39:06.448 --> 03:39:06.989]  Ridiculous!
[03:39:07.830 --> 03:39:15.657]  What about John Brennan, the psychopath former CIA director who keeps threatening the president on Twitter?
[03:39:15.657 --> 03:39:24.466]  A man who personally approved the visas for a number of the hijackers in Saudi Arabia who came to this country and attacked America on 9-11?
[03:39:26.023 --> 03:39:35.927]  Or what about his conversion to radical Islam when he served as the CIA station chief in Rita?
[03:39:35.927 --> 03:39:53.593]  Or what about his lies to the Congress regarding whether the Steele dossier that was paid for by Hillary Clinton's minions, money laundering campaign cash through a law firm and calling it legal fees, a violation of the law, far worse than anything Michael Cohen is charged with.
[03:39:54.213 --> 03:39:57.816]  Why does he get away with lying to the Congress about that?
[03:39:57.816 --> 03:40:12.069]  Or lying about the fact that he had the Central Intelligence Agency break into the computers and spy on a Senate committee run by Dianne Feinstein that was investigating the CIA's illegal use of torture?
[03:40:12.649 --> 03:40:15.590]  No prosecution of John Brennan.
[03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:17.852]  What about Hillary Clinton herself?
[03:40:17.852 --> 03:40:21.913]  Talk about the destruction of evidence in her emails.
[03:40:21.913 --> 03:40:24.194]  Her illegal email server.
[03:40:24.194 --> 03:40:26.415]  The lies about that server.
[03:40:26.415 --> 03:40:32.798]  Telling the Congress and FBI, oh, I never emailed classified material.
[03:40:32.798 --> 03:40:35.860]  I never received classified material.
[03:40:35.860 --> 03:40:38.381]  Those are material lies.
[03:40:38.381 --> 03:40:40.442]  Those are consequential lies.
[03:40:41.178 --> 03:40:44.942]  But there is no prosecution of Hillary Clinton.
[03:40:44.942 --> 03:40:50.087]  Or what about the greatest treasonous financial crime in American history?
[03:40:50.854 --> 03:41:15.636]  In which the Russian Energy Company Board of Directors individually gave Bill and Hillary Clinton $145 million in contributions to their phony foundation at the very time that 20% of America's enriched uranium reserves were on the table for a shift of control to the Russian state.
[03:41:16.590 --> 03:41:36.003]  Crimes covered up, ironically, by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who knew that the Russian energy company had bribed various officials in the Obama administration, and Robert Mueller himself, who took the uranium samples to Stockholm as a courier for the Russians to inspect.
[03:41:36.627 --> 03:41:43.069]  Yet there is no investigation of these crimes, no investigation of their lies.
[03:41:43.069 --> 03:41:50.392]  Instead, they have manufactured a completely fabricated indictment of me.
[03:41:50.392 --> 03:41:52.232]  Am I the last hors d'oeuvre?
[03:41:52.232 --> 03:41:53.333]  Perhaps.
[03:41:53.333 --> 03:41:57.114]  Or maybe they're going to get a full meal when they try to go after Alex Jones.
[03:41:57.788 --> 03:42:04.029]  Because in recent weeks we have seen completely false allegations about Alex Jones.
[03:42:04.029 --> 03:42:18.872]  Various media outlets claiming that he is a Russian asset, that he took money from the Russian front, the Agency for Research, or whatever it is called.
[03:42:18.872 --> 03:42:21.513]  The claim that he was paid by RT.
[03:42:22.313 --> 03:42:25.836]  Which was told to me by an obnoxious New York Times reporter.
[03:42:25.836 --> 03:42:26.857]  Whole cloth.
[03:42:26.857 --> 03:42:27.658]  A lie.
[03:42:27.658 --> 03:42:29.740]  A bare-faced lie.
[03:42:29.740 --> 03:42:30.781]  Untrue.
[03:42:30.781 --> 03:42:48.337]  We'll be coming right back to talk about why it is Republicans, conservatives, lovers of freedom, who are under attack by the Mueller investigation and the Justice Department, while the Clintons and their cronies, and Obama and his cronies, walk free among us.
[03:42:55.888 --> 03:42:58.931]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:42:58.931 --> 03:43:05.376]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[03:43:05.376 --> 03:43:20.849]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[03:43:20.849 --> 03:43:24.592]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[03:43:26.385 --> 03:43:34.450]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[03:43:34.450 --> 03:43:40.855]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[03:43:40.855 --> 03:43:42.856]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[03:43:42.856 --> 03:43:45.418]  Perk up with TurboForce at infowarrestore.com.
[03:43:52.907 --> 03:43:57.050]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:43:57.050 --> 03:44:04.095]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:44:04.095 --> 03:44:08.899]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.

[03:44:53.934 --> 03:44:56.195]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:44:56.195 --> 03:44:57.936]  There is no set stasis.
[03:44:57.936 --> 03:44:59.157]  There is no managed system.
[03:44:59.157 --> 03:45:00.818]  There is no un-continuum.
[03:45:00.818 --> 03:45:04.040]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[03:45:04.040 --> 03:45:07.402]  So, you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[03:45:07.402 --> 03:45:08.643]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[03:45:08.643 --> 03:45:09.443]  We'll be here forever.
[03:45:09.443 --> 03:45:10.684]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:45:10.684 --> 03:45:18.128]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[03:45:18.128 --> 03:45:19.889]  And that's really where this goes.
[03:45:19.889 --> 03:45:22.111]  I tell you, God's got a big war for you ready.
[03:45:22.111 --> 03:45:22.491]  And so,
[03:45:22.691 --> 03:45:29.157]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[03:45:29.157 --> 03:45:34.221]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[03:45:34.221 --> 03:45:37.064]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:45:37.064 --> 03:45:39.466]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:45:39.466 --> 03:45:42.969]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[03:45:42.969 --> 03:45:43.990]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:45:44.250 --> 03:45:47.372]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[03:45:47.372 --> 03:45:48.513]  Not these devil worshippers.
[03:45:48.513 --> 03:45:51.395]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[03:45:51.395 --> 03:45:52.476]  I want life!
[03:45:52.476 --> 03:45:53.616]  I want Jesus!
[03:45:53.616 --> 03:45:55.418]  Listen, I'm just going to tell this for something right now.
[03:45:55.418 --> 03:46:01.282]  I think our best products are Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with a 95% curcuminoid level that no other company got.
[03:46:01.282 --> 03:46:02.002]  Nobody else did.
[03:46:02.002 --> 03:46:06.005]  Because everybody else, they put in a little bit of product and then they do a bunch of advertising and promote it.
[03:46:06.005 --> 03:46:07.246]  The turmeric in this is 95% curcuminoid.
[03:46:09.247 --> 03:46:11.969]  Nobody else has that bright yellow school bus color.
[03:46:11.969 --> 03:46:12.910]  That's what you're looking for.
[03:46:12.910 --> 03:46:13.510]  It's got it.
[03:46:13.510 --> 03:46:16.052]  Find out about bodies today at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:46:16.052 --> 03:46:17.713]  We have the best fish oil out there.

[03:46:21.796 --> 03:46:26.219]  We also have for adults, the ultimate krill oil that is so pure, so good.
[03:46:26.219 --> 03:46:27.940]  We have the ultimate fish oil as well.
[03:46:27.940 --> 03:46:29.401]  All three of those, everybody.
[03:46:29.401 --> 03:46:31.862]  Energy for healthy life, for brain, for heart.
[03:46:31.862 --> 03:46:32.703]  These are the best.
[03:46:32.703 --> 03:46:33.884]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:46:33.884 --> 03:46:37.226]  And then don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, we have our newest Turbo Force.
[03:46:37.406 --> 03:46:42.410]  For folks in the military, or doctors, or long-haul truck drivers, or airline pilots, or whatever.
[03:46:42.410 --> 03:46:47.395]  This is the cleanest-burning, wide-spectrum, nootropic energy, beyond-energy drink.
[03:46:47.395 --> 03:46:49.697]  Super-strong, super-healthy, super-amazing.
[03:46:49.697 --> 03:46:52.239]  TurboForce, I believe, has become our number one best-selling product.
[03:46:52.239 --> 03:46:57.643]  You need to try TurboForce today!
[03:46:57.643 --> 03:47:00.286]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:05.472 --> 03:47:07.033]  Welcome back.
[03:47:07.033 --> 03:47:08.694]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:47:08.694 --> 03:47:14.619]  Reaching you from an undisclosed location in our nation's capital.
[03:47:34.369 --> 03:47:43.576]  If I could tell you where I am and the radical left found out, my life, quite honestly, would be in danger.
[03:47:43.576 --> 03:47:46.077]  That's really where we are in America today.
[03:47:46.077 --> 03:47:51.741]  The unhinged, crazy, loony left, screaming for blood.
[03:47:51.741 --> 03:47:56.845]  The attacks on Owen Schroyer yesterday, outside the courthouse.
[03:47:57.623 --> 03:48:15.430]  Although I must admit, I was gratified when a lady came up to me in the lobby of the hotel where I'm staying, which is a very well-known hotel that starts with a T. She said how impressed and gratified she was to meet my son.
[03:48:15.430 --> 03:48:19.572]  I thought for a moment, well, my son's not in Washington.
[03:48:19.572 --> 03:48:22.633]  And then I realized she's referring to Owen Schroer.
[03:48:23.496 --> 03:48:28.739]  I was complimented and honored because he is a courageous journalist.
[03:48:28.739 --> 03:48:37.083]  He is fearless and he is out there on the streets confronting those who would take away my First Amendment rights.
[03:48:37.083 --> 03:48:49.069]  Now, there's terrific pace up right now at the Gateway Pundit, I think it leads the page, about the fact that when I was arrested, the FBI took my 71-year-old wife
[03:48:51.408 --> 03:48:57.050]  I would be very angry when she tells you that I said how old she is, but she doesn't look 71.
[03:48:57.050 --> 03:48:58.531]  She's the light of my life.
[03:48:58.531 --> 03:49:03.213]  She's the rock that keeps me together in this incredible ordeal.
[03:49:03.213 --> 03:49:05.394]  She and my God.
[03:49:05.394 --> 03:49:13.337]  But they walked her out on the street in her nightgown, in her bare feet at five o'clock in the morning, made her stand next to me.
[03:49:13.337 --> 03:49:14.798]  I was handcuffed.
[03:49:14.798 --> 03:49:16.478]  She at least was not.
[03:49:16.478 --> 03:49:18.179]  She is accused of no crime.
[03:49:18.883 --> 03:49:21.545]  She was not allowed to touch her cell phone.
[03:49:21.545 --> 03:49:33.293]  My children, my grandchildren, were trying to reach her to make sure she was okay, having seen on the television that their father and grandfather had been arrested.
[03:49:33.293 --> 03:49:36.836]  But the FBI would not allow her to touch her phone all day.
[03:49:36.836 --> 03:49:39.077]  She's a practicing Buddhist.
[03:49:39.077 --> 03:49:40.959]  She's a Roman Catholic like me.
[03:49:40.959 --> 03:49:44.921]  Buddhism is a philosophy of peace.
[03:49:44.921 --> 03:49:48.404]  But she was not allowed to open her gahansit or to chant.
[03:49:49.291 --> 03:50:09.283]  She had to essentially sit in the corner while the FBI went through every inch of my home, setting up police tape, setting up tents and tables in the front yard, going through every one of my personal possessions, seeking something, anything that could be used to embarrass me.
[03:50:09.283 --> 03:50:13.105]  It's a travesty that this can come happen in America.
[03:50:13.105 --> 03:50:14.086]  The question's obvious.
[03:50:14.835 --> 03:50:21.998]  When will Bill and Hillary Clinton's home in Chappaqua be raided by 29 FBI agents?
[03:50:21.998 --> 03:50:27.880]  When will John Brennan be taken into custody for his lies before the Congress?
[03:50:27.880 --> 03:50:38.564]  Why can James Comey tell the Congress that he didn't leak classified information or confidential information to the New York Times when he did?
[03:50:38.564 --> 03:50:40.565]  How is it that James Clapper,
[03:50:41.427 --> 03:50:48.229]  Tells the Congress under oath that there is no metadata collection program on Americans.
[03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:54.730]  Disproved by The Intercept and Glenn Greenwald reporting on Edward Snowden.
[03:50:54.730 --> 03:50:58.711]  A bald-faced, treasonous lie.
[03:50:58.711 --> 03:51:08.113]  Yet today, Mr. Clapper is teaching ethics at Vermont College and working as a paid analyst for CNN.
[03:51:09.457 --> 03:51:26.494]  And then there's the question of why a CNN camera was 15 feet from my doorway and allowed to record the FBI agents in full SWAT gear with their night vision goggles and their assault weapons swarming my home.
[03:51:26.494 --> 03:51:31.979]  The street was sealed off to all traffic, all traffic that is other than CNN.
[03:51:33.539 --> 03:51:49.928]  And we now know that Josh Campbell, the producer on site directing the CNN camera team, is a former assistant to FBI Director James Comey and a longtime FBI employee.
[03:51:49.928 --> 03:51:58.273]  Yet CNN expects us to believe their claim that they were just operating on the basis of a tip.
[03:51:58.273 --> 03:51:58.913]  Not credible.
[03:51:59.691 --> 03:52:09.840]  At least one Republican Congressman has asked for an investigation because the disclosure of a search warrant in advance of the search warrant being executed is a crime.
[03:52:11.178 --> 03:52:14.339]  But you see, they wanted to poison the jury pool.
[03:52:14.339 --> 03:52:17.941]  They want to make me public enemy number one.
[03:52:17.941 --> 03:52:32.288]  They want me to look like a drug kingpin or some kind of criminal to make sure that a jury gets the idea, even though I am accused of a series of nonviolent process crimes to which I pled not guilty.
[03:52:32.288 --> 03:52:35.429]  Now, when I was arrested at five
[03:52:35.981 --> 03:52:36.822]  We're good to go.
[03:52:52.600 --> 03:52:57.304]  You can buy this t-shirt at 1776.shop.
[03:52:57.304 --> 03:53:04.310]  That's 1776.shop with the proceeds going to my legal defense fund.
[03:53:04.310 --> 03:53:09.014]  And I'm gratified for those of you who do go there and purchase a t-shirt.
[03:53:09.014 --> 03:53:10.315]  Many have.
[03:53:10.315 --> 03:53:12.196]  I'm fighting for my life.
[03:53:12.196 --> 03:53:14.418]  My life is in your hands.
[03:53:14.418 --> 03:53:17.481]  You can read online that I'm worth 20, 10, 15 million dollars.
[03:53:17.481 --> 03:53:17.881]  It's a lie.
[03:53:21.431 --> 03:53:23.473]  I am virtually penniless.
[03:53:23.473 --> 03:53:27.136]  I am held together by the support of InfoWars.
[03:53:27.136 --> 03:53:38.945]  I am held together by the generous contributions of those who are paying for my legal defense fund and now must pay for some security so I can get to trial without being killed.
[03:53:38.945 --> 03:53:40.506]  That's where we are.
[03:53:40.506 --> 03:53:45.950]  I don't want to be Jack Ruby'd somewhere in the streets of DC.
[03:53:45.950 --> 03:53:49.413]  I particularly want to thank all of those who have contacted me and told me
[03:53:50.154 --> 03:53:52.135]  That they are praying for me.
[03:53:52.135 --> 03:53:54.536]  Because prayer has power.
[03:53:54.536 --> 03:53:56.798]  And our God has power.
[03:53:56.798 --> 03:53:59.679]  And I am protected by my belief in God.
[03:53:59.679 --> 03:54:02.000]  I was given a St.
[03:54:02.000 --> 03:54:09.745]  Michael's medal by a very dear friend at Christmas who told me to wear this for my protection and to pray every day to St.
[03:54:09.745 --> 03:54:10.785]  Michael.
[03:54:10.785 --> 03:54:12.366]  And I do.
[03:54:12.366 --> 03:54:15.608]  The FBI stripped me of that medal when I was arrested.
[03:54:16.372 --> 03:54:21.933]  As I was also unallowed to wear a belt or any shoes with shoelaces.
[03:54:21.933 --> 03:54:24.154]  But I am not suicidal.
[03:54:24.154 --> 03:54:26.854]  Because suicide is against God's law.
[03:54:26.854 --> 03:54:29.215]  And I will fight for my life.
[03:54:29.215 --> 03:54:31.415]  I will fight for the truth.
[03:54:31.415 --> 03:54:34.476]  And I know that Alex Jones is in my corner.
[03:54:34.476 --> 03:54:37.196]  And InfoWars is in my corner.
[03:54:37.196 --> 03:54:41.277]  But you cannot let them shut InfoWars down.
[03:54:41.277 --> 03:54:45.758]  InfoWars is a vital piece of my strategic plan to fight back.
[03:54:46.914 --> 03:55:03.043]  And there's nothing more that the Oliver Darcy's and the Jacob, Jared Holtz and the other dweebs who hate the First Amendment, hate free expression, hate the free press, hate the Constitution would like to do.
[03:55:03.043 --> 03:55:06.245]  So there's two things I ask at the end of this epic broadcast.
[03:55:07.014 --> 03:55:25.245]  Please go to the InfoWars.com store now and send a generous contribution or buy one of our great products, whether it's Survival Shield or Super Male Vitality or Bodies or my favorite, which has kept me in good shape these last several days, Brain Force Plus.
[03:55:25.245 --> 03:55:27.107]  You can see I'm losing my voice.
[03:55:27.107 --> 03:55:29.188]  I'm starting to sound like Alex Jones.
[03:55:30.047 --> 03:55:36.212]  But I will never stop talking in defense of our country and in defense of our president.
[03:55:36.212 --> 03:55:40.115]  And then please, go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:55:40.115 --> 03:55:42.517]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:55:42.517 --> 03:55:45.099]  These lawyers are very expensive.
[03:55:45.099 --> 03:55:46.820]  But they're not pussies.
[03:55:46.820 --> 03:55:48.361]  They're not cowards.
[03:55:48.361 --> 03:55:50.723]  They will not shrink from the fight.
[03:55:50.723 --> 03:55:56.788]  And like Robert Barnes, who's clearly a tough guy and a crusader, they will fight to keep me free.
[03:55:57.406 --> 03:55:59.587]  But I can't do it without your help.
[03:55:59.587 --> 03:56:08.233]  So please go to stonedefensefund.com, go to infowars.com at the store, and give us your support.
[03:56:08.233 --> 03:56:11.015]  Together, we will prevail.
[03:56:11.015 --> 03:56:12.976]  I'm committed to this fight.
[03:56:12.976 --> 03:56:16.819]  To quote my friend Alex Jones, I will not falter.
[03:56:16.819 --> 03:56:17.800]  I will not fail.
[03:56:17.800 --> 03:56:20.401]  I will not quit.
[03:56:20.401 --> 03:56:22.323]  I will not fold.
[03:56:22.323 --> 03:56:23.543]  But I cannot do it alone.
[03:56:23.543 --> 03:56:25.645]  And I appeal to everyone
[03:56:26.365 --> 03:56:30.487]  Look at this clip very quickly of my daughter, who spoke yesterday.
[03:56:30.487 --> 03:56:40.210]  There's some things that you don't know about Roger that I'm very proud of, along in his career.
[03:56:40.210 --> 03:56:46.072]  They're criminalizing what he does, and what he does is brilliant.
[03:56:46.072 --> 03:56:50.834]  They're criminalizing campaign strategies.
[03:56:52.214 --> 03:56:53.715]  It's not okay.
[03:56:53.715 --> 03:56:58.156]  You can't just lynch somebody because you don't like what they do.
[03:56:58.156 --> 03:56:59.357]  And there you have it.
[03:56:59.357 --> 03:57:02.638]  I'm very proud of my daughter, Adria Stone.
[03:57:02.638 --> 03:57:12.861]  There was a contingent of freaks at my home last night, along with a throng of supporters, and I want them to know how much I appreciate their support.
[03:57:12.861 --> 03:57:15.482]  Thank you for joining me today on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:16.408 --> 03:57:19.951]  Wild horses could not have kept me off the air today.
[03:57:19.951 --> 03:57:22.974]  I will fight if you have my back.
[03:57:22.974 --> 03:57:25.896]  I will fight if you have InfoWars back.
[03:57:25.896 --> 03:57:27.197]  We'll be right back.
[03:57:27.197 --> 03:57:29.039]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:29.039 --> 03:57:31.241]  Thank you and God bless you.
[03:57:31.241 --> 03:57:32.822]  Victory or death.
[03:57:45.834 --> 03:57:48.875]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:57:48.875 --> 03:57:55.317]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[03:57:55.317 --> 03:58:10.783]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[03:58:10.783 --> 03:58:14.524]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[03:58:16.331 --> 03:58:24.378]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[03:58:24.378 --> 03:58:30.803]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[03:58:30.803 --> 03:58:32.804]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[03:58:32.804 --> 03:58:35.367]  Perk up with TurboForce at infowarrestore.com.
[03:58:44.287 --> 03:58:50.314]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew they canned food during the fall so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:58:50.314 --> 03:58:53.258]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:58:53.258 --> 03:58:57.823]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply, one of the top
[03:58:58.874 --> 03:59:08.018]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[03:59:08.018 --> 03:59:13.381]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[03:59:13.381 --> 03:59:15.642]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[03:59:15.642 --> 03:59:19.164]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[03:59:19.164 --> 03:59:20.644]  They've got special diet foods.
[03:59:20.644 --> 03:59:24.626]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[03:59:24.626 --> 03:59:26.827]  They've got so many great products there.
[03:59:26.827 --> 03:59:27.928]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[03:59:28.388 --> 03:59:30.370]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[03:59:30.370 --> 03:59:32.892]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[03:59:32.892 --> 03:59:37.917]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[03:59:37.917 --> 03:59:47.166]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[03:59:47.166 --> 03:59:49.808]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
