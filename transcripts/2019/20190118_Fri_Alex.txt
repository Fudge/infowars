[00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:18.992]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:00:18.992 --> 00:00:21.093]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:26.795]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:28.415]  You found it.
[00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:35.177]  This is the tip of the spear when it comes to news and information.
[00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:46.898]  And that is why we are the most censored news organization in the West, potentially in the world, in the history of the United States.
[00:00:46.898 --> 00:00:51.400]  And that's not because we're crazy or loony or wrong.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.322]  It's because we're a threat to the establishment, specifically the corporate media.
[00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:09.710]  That has their little minions like Oliver Darcy and Brian Stelter, hi guys, tuned in every day to find something and some platform to get us banned from.
[00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.551]  And the latest...
[00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:16.646]  New way they censor us is with a pre-screening that they're calling NewsGuard.
[00:01:16.646 --> 00:01:19.449]  Here's Greg Reese with that report.
[00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:32.282]  A new Chrome extension called NewsGuard claims to restore trust and accountability by telling you what websites are lying to you and which ones are telling the truth.
[00:01:33.603 --> 00:01:49.196]  They provide a news guard shield displayed in the top of your Chrome browser that signals green if a website is trying to get it right and red if it has an agenda or knowingly publishes falsehoods or propaganda.
[00:01:49.957 --> 00:02:04.218]  Interestingly enough, the NewsGuard shield shows red on every website that questions the establishment narrative, and shows green on every website that supports the establishment narrative.
[00:02:04.218 --> 00:02:04.899]  For example,
[00:02:05.948 --> 00:02:15.973]  Establishment news site Forbes praises NewsGuard, saying, NewsGuard gets a leg up in the war on real fake news.
[00:02:15.973 --> 00:02:21.295]  And Forbes gets a green shield from NewsGuard.
[00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:29.859]  RT, a website that often questions the establishment narrative, posts an article that is critical of NewsGuard.
[00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.121]  And RT gets a red shield from NewsGuard.
[00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:39.688]  On their website, NewsGuard asks, why trust us?
[00:02:39.688 --> 00:02:50.321]  And when we look at their advisory board, we see Richard Stengel, who proudly describes himself to the Council on Foreign Relations as a propagandist.
[00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:55.883]  My old job at the State Department was what people used to joke as the chief propagandist job.
[00:02:55.883 --> 00:02:57.543]  We haven't talked about propaganda.
[00:02:57.543 --> 00:02:59.604]  Propaganda, I'm not against propaganda.
[00:02:59.604 --> 00:03:03.085]  Every country does it, and they have to do it to their own population.
[00:03:03.085 --> 00:03:05.225]  And I don't necessarily think it's that awful.
[00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:18.468]  We see retired General Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and NSA, who has made multiple media appearances where he exclaims a clear, strong bias against President Trump.
[00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:40.278]  And at a press conference in July of 2018, the White House press secretary told reporters that in addition to revoking Brennan's security clearance, the president is considered revoking clearances for Director James Comey, James Clapper, Michael Hayden, Susan Rice, and Andrew McCabe.
[00:03:41.358 --> 00:03:57.227]  NewsGuard is like a new version of Snopes.com, except rather than being run by one shady character, NewsGuard is run by a slew of establishment swamp creatures, such as Gordon Krovitz of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:02.909]  And former Secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge.
[00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:10.895]  NewsGuard tells you what to believe so that you don't have to bother with the basic responsibility of due diligence.
[00:04:10.895 --> 00:04:14.978]  The ruse is obvious to those thinking for themselves.
[00:04:14.978 --> 00:04:22.743]  But NewsGuard is only trying to corral the few sheeple the establishment have left in their stables.
[00:04:22.743 --> 00:04:26.125]  They will only succeed at placating their ignorant flock.
[00:04:27.906 --> 00:04:35.868]  So one has to ask, how does the establishment plan to deal with those of us who think for ourselves?
[00:04:35.868 --> 00:04:37.969]  This is Greg Reese for NewsWars.com.
[00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:45.051]  That's right.
[00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:47.832]  Let someone else decide what's news.
[00:04:47.832 --> 00:04:49.852]  Let someone else decide what's real.
[00:04:49.852 --> 00:04:52.333]  You can't trust yourself after all.
[00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:53.493]  Don't trust your own eyes.
[00:04:53.493 --> 00:04:54.953]  Don't trust your own ears.
[00:04:54.953 --> 00:04:56.594]  Trust the unseen.
[00:05:00.325 --> 00:05:07.789]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Life has the formula for you.

[00:05:48.058 --> 00:05:50.805]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.

[00:05:54.494 --> 00:05:56.619]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com
[00:06:06.068 --> 00:06:12.551]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[00:06:12.551 --> 00:06:14.872]  It's Owen Troyer.
[00:06:14.872 --> 00:06:29.398]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:29.398 --> 00:06:32.760]  You know, it's the same thing that we all already knew.
[00:06:35.973 --> 00:06:52.827]  But going back down this road just to remind us of the environment we're in and the elements and the surroundings is what we have to do.
[00:06:52.827 --> 00:07:02.114]  And when you now have pretty much everyone, it's not just BuzzFeed admitting that, yeah, we have no evidence of Russia collusion.
[00:07:02.114 --> 00:07:02.295]  I mean,
[00:07:03.462 --> 00:07:13.370]  Just about every news outlet, I mean, even Eric Swalwell goes on CNN and admits, yeah, I've seen nothing, even though he says he has it all.
[00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:26.660]  So it's this amazing con game they play, and Russian collusion, of course, is just one instance, one example.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.424]  But think about the state of our country.
[00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:58.109]  When you have hundreds of congressmen and women, dozens if not hundreds of people in the media, that are so overwhelmed by hatred, so overwhelmed by disgust, that they knowingly go along with a false narrative, Russian collusion, simply because they hate you,
[00:07:59.508 --> 00:08:05.509]  And they hate that you elected Donald Trump.
[00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:13.490]  And the bitterness turns into total hysteria.
[00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:28.293]  The good news is, from an anonymous source that wrote an op-ed in the Daily Caller, there are 15%, if you call that good news, 15% of the men and women in Congress actually care.
[00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:31.415]  And are actually patriots.
[00:08:31.415 --> 00:08:36.416]  Of course, you know, you can count maybe 0% of Democrats for that statistic.
[00:08:36.416 --> 00:08:43.938]  Thought maybe Tulsi Gabbard, but she goes with the whole PC thing, so she's out.
[00:08:43.938 --> 00:08:57.420]  But Jim Jordan is one of the congressmen that's really doing his job, but just doing your job in Congress now makes you almost a hero, a legend.
[00:08:58.397 --> 00:09:03.218]  In modern times.
[00:09:03.218 --> 00:09:22.423]  And so while the Democrats and the mainstream media are sitting here figuring the latest way they can spin up some hysteria over Russian collusion, it'll be Michael Cohen today, it'll be the dossier tomorrow, it'll be who knows next week.
[00:09:22.423 --> 00:09:23.283]  Let's not forget
[00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:41.092]  That you also have the Democrats doing anything and everything they can to stop a wall at the border, where I've got a ton of stories today that I could get to about why we need a wall.
[00:09:41.092 --> 00:09:53.337]  But let's just remind ourselves the total scumbaggery of the Democrat Party broken down so eloquently by Jim Jordan in Congress yesterday.
[00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:59.418]  Because today's left has taken the most radical positions in American history.
[00:09:59.418 --> 00:10:02.520]  They applaud Kaepernick when he disrespects the flag.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.882]  They embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never that great.
[00:10:05.882 --> 00:10:08.964]  We're not going to make America great again.
[00:10:08.964 --> 00:10:09.905]  It was never that great.
[00:10:10.888 --> 00:10:15.853]  And they cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harass anyone who supports the president.
[00:10:15.853 --> 00:10:26.762]  If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd!
[00:10:34.525 --> 00:10:38.286]  Today's left thinks that America is just another country.
[00:10:38.286 --> 00:10:41.687]  Just one of the 190 some countries on the planet.
[00:10:41.687 --> 00:10:44.307]  United States of America is not just another country.
[00:10:44.307 --> 00:10:50.969]  It's the greatest nation in history that has done more good for more people than any country ever.
[00:10:50.969 --> 00:10:54.110]  A special place where people from all over the world
[00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:05.437]  All shapes, all sizes, all colors, all talents come to so they can chase down their goals, chase down their dreams, make life better for themselves and their family.
[00:11:05.437 --> 00:11:15.383]  That's this country, a special place where people come and respect the Constitution, cherish the Bill of Rights, and embrace the rule of law.
[00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:18.544]  Democrat Congressman Blumenauer said, abolish ICE.
[00:11:19.765 --> 00:11:25.828]  Secretary Clinton, when she was running for the highest office in the land, said we need a borderless hemisphere.
[00:11:25.828 --> 00:11:39.134]  We've learned from the WikiLeaks that you said this, and I want to quote, I will continue speaking out for comprehensive immigration reform.
[00:11:39.134 --> 00:11:43.135]  I think the people who are here deserve a path to citizenship.
[00:11:43.135 --> 00:11:44.076]  Speaker Pelosi,
[00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:46.738]  A wall is an immorality.
[00:11:46.738 --> 00:11:49.440]  So in some cases you would be supportive of non-citizens?
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.041]  I wouldn't oppose it.
[00:12:01.932 --> 00:12:03.193]  She wouldn't oppose it.
[00:12:03.193 --> 00:12:08.635]  It sounds like she's open to non-citizens voting in local elections.
[00:12:08.635 --> 00:12:12.117]  Americans believe that borders need to be strong.
[00:12:12.117 --> 00:12:18.921]  Americans believe, we believe, that there's a difference, a big difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration.
[00:12:18.921 --> 00:12:29.046]  And Americans and Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus believe that a border security wall will help stop the drug problem, the gang problem, and the human trafficking problem.
[00:12:31.212 --> 00:12:38.817]  You know, it's hard to come on here and to voice the concern that I have.
[00:12:38.817 --> 00:12:45.341]  It's hard to come on here and voice all the issues that are going on right now.
[00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:54.547]  But the real challenge is not for me to figure out how to voice this, but to figure out
[00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:07.855]  What it's going to take for the common man in America, what it's going to take for the average American citizen to wake up and realize there is some serious trouble afoot.
[00:13:07.855 --> 00:13:11.357]  I mean, let's just look at three stories right now that are all huge.
[00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:14.418]  They're just three stories and it's smattering.
[00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:16.239]  A total fake news story, Russian collusion.
[00:13:17.273 --> 00:13:23.119]  That has one side of the aisle totally convinced Donald Trump and his associates are all going to be in jail.
[00:13:23.119 --> 00:13:25.081]  That's where they're at for Russian collusion.
[00:13:25.081 --> 00:13:26.963]  A total fake news narrative.
[00:13:26.963 --> 00:13:27.403]  100% hoax.
[00:13:27.403 --> 00:13:29.225]  Unless you're talking about Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:33.610]  You've got a wide-open border and a humanitarian crisis at the border.
[00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.471]  Not even mentioning the humanitarian crisis you have in California right now, which we'll cover that.
[00:13:37.471 --> 00:13:39.892]  So a total disaster happening at the border right now.
[00:13:39.892 --> 00:13:41.953]  The Democrats want to do nothing about it.
[00:13:41.953 --> 00:13:53.436]  You have the total attack on free speech in the West right now, where you've probably seen the story from Free Press about how they want Alex Jones off the air.
[00:13:53.436 --> 00:13:57.197]  They got a new story today, ladies and gentlemen, responding to this.
[00:13:57.197 --> 00:13:58.858]  Free Press vs. hate.
[00:14:00.646 --> 00:14:13.933]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is so racist, homophobic, and xenophobic that Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Twitter, and YouTube banned him and his show, InfoWars, from their sites in 2018.
[00:14:13.933 --> 00:14:22.358]  But now he's returned to Facebook with multiple new pages and the social media giant has allowed him to resume profiting off lies and hate.
[00:14:22.358 --> 00:14:25.940]  That's from the Free Speech Net two days ago.
[00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:32.855]  Now they've launched another petition to have us banned off everything else, anywhere we exist.
[00:14:32.855 --> 00:14:39.118]  And again, this is from the free press that want us shut down.
[00:14:39.118 --> 00:14:53.464]  And then you have the Council on Foreign Relations and Michael Hayden and others giving you news screenings and telling you what you can trust and what you can't trust, because after all, you can't trust yourself.
[00:14:54.468 --> 00:14:56.589]  That's what they're really saying.
[00:14:56.589 --> 00:15:01.531]  Don't trust yourself, trust us.
[00:15:01.531 --> 00:15:05.492]  Which is exactly what a tyrant would say.
[00:15:05.492 --> 00:15:07.673]  Exactly what an authoritarian would say.
[00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:10.414]  Exactly what a totalitarian would say.
[00:15:10.414 --> 00:15:15.115]  Exactly what a blood-sucking demon would say.
[00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:17.896]  And so, that's where we're at today.
[00:15:17.896 --> 00:15:19.497]  Now Alex Jones is going to be joining us
[00:15:21.178 --> 00:15:25.564]  And not too long with breaking news and some other developments that he's going to bring on here.
[00:15:25.564 --> 00:15:31.112]  So Alex Jones will be joining us before we sign off here on the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:15:32.128 --> 00:15:35.389]  On this Friday, the 18th of January, 2019.
[00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:44.690]  We also have Andrew Lawrence coming up, who confronted the racist Professor Irami Frimpong.
[00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:54.532]  And then Andrew Tate, the MMA fighter, who you've probably heard of lately dealing with a vaccine issue and other such things.
[00:15:54.532 --> 00:15:55.713]  Nick Begich in the fourth hour.
[00:15:55.713 --> 00:15:56.933]  This is all on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:56.933 --> 00:15:57.453]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:59.335 --> 00:16:02.077]  Bacon lovers, we ship free!

[00:18:00.208 --> 00:18:03.811]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:05.572]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.572 --> 00:18:17.622]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.622 --> 00:18:23.026]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[00:18:23.106 --> 00:18:23.666]  We're good to go!
[00:18:47.284 --> 00:18:48.986]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[00:18:48.986 --> 00:18:50.147]  There is no set stasis.
[00:18:50.147 --> 00:18:52.489]  There is no managed system.
[00:18:52.489 --> 00:18:53.550]  There is no un-continuum.
[00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.552]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[00:19:10.104 --> 00:19:13.446]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[00:19:13.446 --> 00:19:14.686]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:15.466]  We'll be here forever.
[00:19:15.466 --> 00:19:16.747]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[00:19:16.747 --> 00:19:23.630]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.190]  We made it.
[00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.351]  And that's really where this goes.
[00:19:26.351 --> 00:19:28.172]  God's got a big war for you, right?
[00:19:28.172 --> 00:19:28.532]  And so
[00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:35.219]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[00:19:35.219 --> 00:19:40.284]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[00:19:40.284 --> 00:19:43.147]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[00:19:43.147 --> 00:19:45.369]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:49.033]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[00:19:49.033 --> 00:19:50.074]  I want to go to the next level.
[00:19:50.314 --> 00:19:54.577]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[00:19:54.577 --> 00:19:57.479]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[00:19:57.479 --> 00:19:58.540]  I want life!
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:03.263]  I want Jesus!
[00:20:03.263 --> 00:20:05.865]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:13.697 --> 00:20:19.179]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Troyer.
[00:20:19.179 --> 00:20:21.961]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.961 --> 00:20:40.069]  You know, I'm not one that really feels pressure or nervous or ever starstruck or anything like that, but there's a weight to try to properly
[00:20:45.154 --> 00:20:59.499]  Put this information out there and the challenge is to just really somehow translate the gravity of the situation we're in.
[00:20:59.499 --> 00:21:05.401]  I know the average audience member knows this, but this should be a no-brainer.
[00:21:05.401 --> 00:21:05.901]  For example,
[00:21:08.069 --> 00:21:11.850]  The crew just brought me some news stories because I'm about to go to this clip.
[00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.911]  BuzzFeed reporter admits, you know, there's no Russian collusion.
[00:21:14.911 --> 00:21:22.333]  In fact, you know, we ought to get the Van Jones undercover tape to where Van Jones says that the Russian collusion thing's a nothing burger.
[00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:24.514]  Let's let's get the CNN producer.
[00:21:24.514 --> 00:21:25.734]  These are Project Veritas tapes.
[00:21:25.734 --> 00:21:29.416]  Let's get the CNN producer admitting CNN has no journalistic integrity.
[00:21:29.416 --> 00:21:30.236]  They laugh about it.
[00:21:30.236 --> 00:21:33.557]  It's all about giving you the Trump hate because that's what they think their audience wants.
[00:21:35.779 --> 00:21:37.660]  But, I mean, what am I supposed to say?
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:45.143]  How am I supposed to properly disseminate this information if you can't already see it for yourself?
[00:21:45.143 --> 00:21:45.663]  Does that make sense?
[00:21:45.663 --> 00:22:01.649]  It's like, if you are looking at a painting, let's say you're looking at a famous Rembrandt, and we're both looking at it, like, how do I explain it to you if you can't already see it?
[00:22:09.301 --> 00:22:16.144]  I mean, it's shocking when even Snopes admits.
[00:22:16.144 --> 00:22:19.245]  This is from the fact-checker Snopes.
[00:22:19.245 --> 00:22:27.368]  Did Hillary Clinton tell FBI's Robert Mueller to deliver uranium to Russians in 2009's secret tarmac meeting?
[00:22:27.368 --> 00:22:28.809]  The answer is yes.
[00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:33.243]  But why stop there?
[00:22:33.243 --> 00:22:39.285]  The New York Times documented the whole thing in a 17-page report in April of 2015.
[00:22:39.285 --> 00:22:51.468]  How Hillary Clinton made Russia's Vladimir Putin the number one, the number one possessor of enriched uranium!
[00:22:51.468 --> 00:22:55.950]  Thank you, Hillary!
[00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.150]  But what do you get all day on the news?
[00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.031]  Trump-Russia, Trump-Russia, Trump-Russia.
[00:23:00.031 --> 00:23:00.371]  All fake.
[00:23:01.411 --> 00:23:02.812]  What do you get from these reporters?
[00:23:02.812 --> 00:23:08.817]  Michael Cohen, Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Jerry Corsi.
[00:23:08.817 --> 00:23:13.121]  Where's the Russian collusion?
[00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:19.045]  So that's a political witch hunt that's landed people in jail, solitary confinement.
[00:23:19.045 --> 00:23:20.346]  Hillary Clinton walks free.
[00:23:20.346 --> 00:23:30.214]  One of the biggest criminals, if not the biggest criminal in the history of the United States government.
[00:23:30.214 --> 00:23:30.815]  Maybe Obama.
[00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:47.753]  But let's go to this clip of a BuzzFeed reporter admitting, just like the rest of them, I mean, Swalwell goes on TV and admits they got nothing now, even though he claims he has something, he admits he really has nothing.
[00:23:47.753 --> 00:23:54.260]  So here's the BuzzFeed reporter admitting, well, there really is no Russian collusion, but we're still going to report on it all day.
[00:23:55.538 --> 00:23:59.461]  Can you tell us, Anthony, the evidence?
[00:23:59.461 --> 00:24:08.707]  I know that in the report you say that you have spoken, you have two law enforcement sources who tell you that they have seen... Who are these people?
[00:24:08.707 --> 00:24:20.716]  ...texts, emails, a cache of other documents, maybe transcripts with other witnesses in Trump organization that Donald Trump pressured Michael Cohen to lie, he suborned perjury.
[00:24:20.716 --> 00:24:23.718]  Have you seen any of that other corroborating evidence?
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:36.230]  No, I'm not seeing it personally, but the folks that we've talked to, the two officials that we've spoken to are fully 100% read in to that aspect of the special counsel.
[00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:41.434]  Yeah, he's talking about Eric Swalwell and Adam Schiff.
[00:24:41.434 --> 00:24:43.516]  Two liars.
[00:24:43.516 --> 00:24:47.819]  Two Democrat henchmen out in California.
[00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:49.380]  You know what goes on out there, folks.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.922]  Do I really need to spell it out for you?
[00:24:51.772 --> 00:24:54.274]  You know what goes on in Adam Schiff's district, folks?
[00:24:54.274 --> 00:25:03.020]  You know what happens at Ed Buck's house?
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.623]  So again, I mean, I know it's all fake.
[00:25:07.623 --> 00:25:10.625]  I know who these people are.
[00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:11.606]  But what can I do?
[00:25:11.606 --> 00:25:20.853]  How can I properly spread this information, which is not my opinion, okay?
[00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:26.265]  You go to the source!
[00:25:26.265 --> 00:25:32.611]  But you have the entire nation in a tizzy now over fake Russian collusion.
[00:25:32.611 --> 00:25:41.219]  And you really want to know how on a razor's edge this country is?
[00:25:41.219 --> 00:25:47.585]  If you go to the right side of the political aisle in America, what do you get?
[00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:51.111]  Which is the majority, by the way.
[00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:52.172]  It's really not even close.
[00:25:52.172 --> 00:26:00.093]  That's one of the biggest con jobs the media is pulling on us right now, is that Trump's base and conservatism and America First isn't the majority opinion.
[00:26:00.093 --> 00:26:02.674]  It's a super majority.
[00:26:02.674 --> 00:26:06.134]  Unless you're in, you know, LA or New York.
[00:26:06.134 --> 00:26:13.856]  But just think about
[00:26:15.735 --> 00:26:25.529]  Think about what it means to have a media and a Democrat party knowingly lie to you for two years.
[00:26:25.529 --> 00:26:32.399]  Think about what it means that they try to censor any news organization that goes against their lies.
[00:26:33.692 --> 00:26:42.879]  Think about a Democrat party that wants to put Trump in jail for Russian collusion, even though it's all, literally all of it is Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.
[00:26:42.879 --> 00:26:44.620]  But let me get back to my point.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.742]  Here's how on a razor's edge this country is right now.
[00:26:46.742 --> 00:26:49.504]  If you go to the political right in this country, what are they saying?
[00:26:49.504 --> 00:26:51.926]  What do they want?
[00:26:51.926 --> 00:26:54.228]  Forget the wall and all the other political footballs out there.
[00:26:54.228 --> 00:27:01.113]  Let's really get down to firebrand politics.
[00:27:02.873 --> 00:27:16.082]  At the very motivating factor for why people are so upset right now with the Democrat Party.
[00:27:16.082 --> 00:27:19.965]  If you go to the political right, what do people want?
[00:27:19.965 --> 00:27:27.490]  Hillary Clinton in jail, Barack Obama in jail, just let's say the deep state in jail for all the crimes that they've committed.
[00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.550]  So right now,
[00:27:30.287 --> 00:27:32.528]  That's where you're at on the political right.
[00:27:32.528 --> 00:27:35.549]  Put all these people in jail for the crimes we know they committed.
[00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:36.549]  And it's all on record.
[00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:40.211]  That's just, I mean, again, the Uranium One deal, that's one thing.
[00:27:40.211 --> 00:27:45.273]  Hillary Clinton using Russian intelligence to make a fake dossier, that's another thing.
[00:27:45.273 --> 00:27:49.955]  The Obama administration using that dossier to spy on the Trump campaign illegally, that's another thing.
[00:27:49.955 --> 00:27:52.496]  But that's all on record, that's all admitted.
[00:27:52.496 --> 00:27:56.017]  But then let's go to the political left of the aisle in America, and what do they say?
[00:27:57.728 --> 00:27:59.509]  They want Trump in jail.
[00:27:59.509 --> 00:28:01.371]  They want all of Trump's associates in jail.
[00:28:01.371 --> 00:28:02.852]  They want Trump impeached.
[00:28:02.852 --> 00:28:04.153]  They think he's a Russian asset.
[00:28:04.153 --> 00:28:05.514]  They think he's treasonous.
[00:28:05.514 --> 00:28:07.656]  They think he's putting kids in cages.
[00:28:07.656 --> 00:28:11.119]  They think all the worst things that you've heard.
[00:28:11.119 --> 00:28:21.227]  So if you go to the firebrand political conservative and the firebrand political progressive liberal, they both want their opposition in jail.
[00:28:24.929 --> 00:28:28.293]  And they're both waiting for it to happen.
[00:28:28.293 --> 00:28:30.596]  Because, of course!
[00:28:30.596 --> 00:28:33.579]  Well yeah, we know that James Comey perjured himself.
[00:28:33.579 --> 00:28:35.682]  We know that Sundar Pichai perjured himself.
[00:28:35.682 --> 00:28:42.650]  We know that Hillary Clinton made Vladimir Putin the number one possessor of enriched uranium in the world like he wanted to be.
[00:28:43.553 --> 00:28:46.578]  But if you're on the left, they know that Trump colluded with Russia.
[00:28:46.578 --> 00:28:49.702]  They know that it was Trump's administration that stole the election.
[00:28:49.702 --> 00:28:51.645]  They know it was all bad.
[00:28:51.645 --> 00:28:54.169]  And both sides are just waiting for the opposition to get in jail.
[00:28:54.169 --> 00:28:56.312]  Just waiting for the opposition to get in jail.
[00:28:56.312 --> 00:28:57.634]  And none of it happens.
[00:28:59.326 --> 00:29:02.908]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:06.490]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.611]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[00:32:18.697 --> 00:32:24.938]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:32:24.938 --> 00:32:31.239]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:32:31.239 --> 00:32:38.181]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:40.942]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:20.888 --> 00:33:22.569]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:22.569 --> 00:33:24.290]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.211]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.211 --> 00:33:29.233]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:29.233 --> 00:33:43.122]  I feel like I've just been a babbling brook up here trying to explain this information, but... I mean, again... If you can't see how the Democrats are total frauds, then... You know, I don't know what to do.
[00:33:43.122 --> 00:33:48.226]  So I'm gonna try to get focused here and just hit these news stories.
[00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:49.907]  We've got Alex Jones coming up here.
[00:33:51.388 --> 00:34:08.105]  And not too long with breaking news and then Roger Stone is going to be joining us in the third hour as well because I'm telling you folks there's major developments happening in DC right now and there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that I don't know how much Roger is going to want to talk about but he's going to be coming on at 1.06.
[00:34:08.105 --> 00:34:12.450]  Now before I try to focus and get some of this news that is happening right now
[00:34:14.343 --> 00:34:17.284]  Let me remind you about InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:34:17.284 --> 00:34:38.547]  Now, you have seen what Alex Jones has done in the last two years to expand InfoWars, bring more content to InfoWars.com, just produce more content in general, more live streams, obviously 10 hours live a day, the new studios, everything you're seeing, the new products.
[00:34:38.547 --> 00:34:41.288]  And it's all possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:50.976]  This is pretty much the last main vein that we have to market.
[00:34:50.976 --> 00:35:07.768]  So when they shut us off of all of these platforms, we lose the ability to reach those audiences that may have given up trying to find us, may not know where to find us, still looking where to find us, or just can't find us for the first time ever.
[00:35:09.267 --> 00:35:19.714]  And so it's really just the continued sustained support from the audience over the last decade since Alex has been doing the show that makes it all possible.
[00:35:19.714 --> 00:35:22.516]  So, we've got specials at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:35:22.516 --> 00:35:26.419]  50% off Supermail Vitality, which is in its final run.
[00:35:26.419 --> 00:35:29.300]  That's the final run of Supermail Vitality.

[00:36:03.843 --> 00:36:05.964]  Just go do the research into that for yourself.
[00:36:05.964 --> 00:36:08.726]  Not just the chemicals that they add to the water that are no good,
[00:36:09.446 --> 00:36:13.208]  The fluoride, but look at the glyphosates that get in the water.
[00:36:13.208 --> 00:36:17.731]  Look at the other toxic chemicals that have been found in the water like lead.
[00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:23.434]  Go on the internet and look at some places where the water is so contaminated they can light it on fire.
[00:36:23.434 --> 00:36:25.415]  It's combustible.
[00:36:25.415 --> 00:36:29.318]  So why would you not be filtering your water?
[00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:34.720]  With the Alexa Pure Pro Water Filtration System at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.960]  So, check it all out.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.621]  The products you want, the products you need.
[00:36:38.621 --> 00:36:42.061]  Not to mention the t-shirts, the hats, the emergency food supplies.
[00:36:42.061 --> 00:36:44.062]  It's all at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:36:44.062 --> 00:36:45.302]  Makes everything we do here possible.
[00:36:45.302 --> 00:36:54.864]  And we want to continue to do more, but it's frustrating because they continue to, you know, amputate every tentacle that we have.
[00:36:54.864 --> 00:36:58.825]  So it's like, I don't know, something's got to give when that comes to
[00:37:00.515 --> 00:37:04.060]  It's like, does Infowars.com just become massive?
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.904]  Or are they just gonna let us back on their social media platforms?
[00:37:06.904 --> 00:37:08.586]  Well, I doubt the latter happens, so.
[00:37:08.586 --> 00:37:11.570]  It's all about you sharing the links, though, at the end of the day, folks.
[00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:17.778]  Because they won't let us on social media, so they won't let us market ourselves, so we rely on you to market for us.
[00:37:18.599 --> 00:37:20.720]  And of course to shop at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.601]  And you do a great job.
[00:37:22.601 --> 00:37:24.142]  The InfoWars Army is amazing.
[00:37:24.142 --> 00:37:27.323]  A lot of people organize at InfoComms.org.
[00:37:27.323 --> 00:37:29.725]  That's how you can meet fellow InfoWarriors.
[00:37:29.725 --> 00:37:36.648]  People go out and hold signs, go to events with their InfoWars gear on to raise awareness and to spread the news of the broadcast.
[00:37:36.648 --> 00:37:38.389]  So I thank everybody that does that.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:44.002]  And you get to see how we produce more content.
[00:37:44.002 --> 00:37:49.424]  The Women's March is this weekend in D.C., and we will be there with multiple reporters.
[00:37:49.424 --> 00:37:53.066]  Now, you can imagine the type of stuff we may see at the Women's March.
[00:37:53.066 --> 00:37:59.249]  If it's anything like last year, we'll end up back on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:37:59.249 --> 00:38:06.432]  Now, let me just focus and get to some of this news.
[00:38:08.314 --> 00:38:09.655]  Where to begin?
[00:38:09.655 --> 00:38:17.082]  Well, again, BuzzFeed reporter admits he hasn't seen any evidence to validate Trump Tower story.
[00:38:17.082 --> 00:38:31.096]  Of course, this is the same BuzzFeed that took the knowingly fabricated Russian dossier, published it as if it were real, even though they admitted it wasn't real, and then, of course, well, you know the rest of the story.
[00:38:32.765 --> 00:38:35.926]  President Trump just dunked on Nancy Pelosi.
[00:38:35.926 --> 00:38:40.888]  This is from, this is at Infowars.com, Michael Snyder, end of the American dream.
[00:38:40.888 --> 00:38:46.529]  President Trump just dunked on Nancy Pelosi with a power move that has never happened in the annals of congressional history.
[00:38:46.529 --> 00:38:56.312]  Yeah, and then it turned out to be quite an awkward moment for the Democrats after Trump canceled Pelosi's flight an hour before takeoff.
[00:38:56.312 --> 00:38:57.413]  And then what happened?
[00:38:57.413 --> 00:39:01.134]  They were driving around in circles in Washington, D.C.
[00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.671]  Because they didn't know what to do.
[00:39:05.671 --> 00:39:07.451]  Just pathetic.
[00:39:07.451 --> 00:39:08.451]  Just pathetic.
[00:39:08.451 --> 00:39:10.812]  In fact, I think we have some B-roll of that.
[00:39:10.812 --> 00:39:14.113]  The stranded bus that had Pelosi and Schiff.
[00:39:14.113 --> 00:39:15.953]  I mean, it's one of the most awkward things.
[00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:22.714]  So, they cancel the trip, they're all on this bus, and they're doing circles around D.C.
[00:39:22.714 --> 00:39:25.375]  The media knows it, so the media's kind of following them around.
[00:39:25.375 --> 00:39:27.716]  They're kind of hopping in and off the bus.
[00:39:29.983 --> 00:39:34.486]  And it just, it really just kind of personifies who these people are.
[00:39:34.486 --> 00:39:37.187]  They're nothing!
[00:39:37.187 --> 00:39:40.629]  Just drive around the bus, you know, walk around D.C.
[00:39:40.629 --> 00:39:44.491]  like, oh yeah, this is just what we do.
[00:39:44.491 --> 00:39:46.152]  Meanwhile, they're still collecting a paycheck.
[00:39:46.152 --> 00:39:50.515]  How do you like that?
[00:39:50.515 --> 00:39:56.138]  Jim Jordan's inspiring speech, Electrifies the Internet, that's at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:56.138 --> 00:39:57.859]  We played that in the first segment.
[00:39:58.945 --> 00:40:10.232]  Free Press, literally the name of the organization is Free Press, is totally out to get Alex Jones, and they're doubling and tripling down on it, even though everyone that follows the Free Press is like, wait, you're Free Press, why are you attacking InfoWars?
[00:40:10.232 --> 00:40:11.473]  Why are you attacking Alex Jones?
[00:40:11.473 --> 00:40:12.734]  Aren't you for Free Press?
[00:40:12.734 --> 00:40:16.296]  Well, they're saying, no, we are not Free Press.
[00:40:16.296 --> 00:40:18.118]  So that's just what they're saying now.
[00:40:18.118 --> 00:40:19.559]  We just don't have the right to exist.
[00:40:20.663 --> 00:40:30.113]  We don't have the right to broadcast, we don't have the right to be on social media, just shut us down because we're so hateful.
[00:40:30.113 --> 00:40:40.343]  You know, by the way, I honestly cannot even fathom the mind of a modern day leftist.
[00:40:41.178 --> 00:40:47.181]  Because there's so many things, I mean, the mental gymnastics that they have to do in their head, I cannot even comprehend.
[00:40:47.181 --> 00:40:48.041]  Think about it like this.
[00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:51.002]  Let's just give one example of something that's trending recently.
[00:40:51.002 --> 00:40:55.024]  Having a beard is considered toxic masculinity.
[00:40:55.024 --> 00:40:56.805]  You have a beard, toxic masculinity.
[00:40:56.805 --> 00:40:59.926]  Okay, shave your beard, says Gillette.
[00:40:59.926 --> 00:41:06.710]  Again, I'm not trying to be hateful here, but let's just point out facts.
[00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.531]  So, are Muslim men gonna have to shave their beards?
[00:41:10.683 --> 00:41:13.505]  Are Muslim men toxic masculinists?
[00:41:13.505 --> 00:41:23.651]  I mean, really, if you want to look at anything that personifies toxic masculinity, it would be the old 17th century Islam that a lot of these people are still practicing.
[00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:31.936]  Someone asked me, because they sent me a video from back in 2017 when Steven Crowder went to a bunch of Muslim bakeries and asked them to make gay cakes.
[00:41:31.936 --> 00:41:33.357]  They all turned them down.
[00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.517]  Did it make national news?
[00:41:34.517 --> 00:41:35.018]  Nah.
[00:41:35.018 --> 00:41:35.878]  Was there a lawsuit?
[00:41:35.878 --> 00:41:37.479]  Nah.
[00:41:37.479 --> 00:41:38.500]  And then someone asked,
[00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:48.066]  I forget the imam on Twitter, are there any Muslims, are there any places in the religion of Islam where you can have a gay marriage?
[00:41:48.066 --> 00:41:54.112]  And the imam said yes at the top of the roof before they push you off.
[00:41:54.112 --> 00:41:56.275]  But this is what the left is inviting into America.
[00:41:57.199 --> 00:41:59.180]  Because they're tolerant and loving.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:41:59.960]  But see, that's what I'm saying.
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.821]  It's the mental gymnastics that these people do.
[00:42:02.821 --> 00:42:16.006]  And so now, the DNC, which never was actually an official sponsor or anything with the Women's March, the DNC says, we disavow the Women's March for anti-Semitism, even though they were never a sponsor or anything with the Women's March.
[00:42:16.006 --> 00:42:18.647]  They were never officially connected to it.
[00:42:18.647 --> 00:42:20.287]  They disavow it for anti-Semitism.
[00:42:20.287 --> 00:42:21.028]  Why?
[00:42:21.028 --> 00:42:24.829]  Because Linda Sarsour is an Israel Jew hater.
[00:42:26.482 --> 00:42:27.483]  Linda Cockroach.
[00:42:27.483 --> 00:42:29.085]  That's what her name translates to.
[00:42:29.085 --> 00:42:30.546]  Well, it's Beautiful Cockroach.
[00:42:30.546 --> 00:42:39.216]  But, so, is the DNC going to disavow Ilhan Omar because she has a map in her office that doesn't even have Israel on it, just Palestine?
[00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:47.332]  Is the DNC going to disavow Rashida Tlaib, who also says Israel has no right to exist?
[00:42:47.332 --> 00:42:50.833]  So, do you see the mental gymnastics these people have to do?
[00:42:50.833 --> 00:42:51.813]  And it doesn't stop there.
[00:42:51.813 --> 00:42:53.974]  I mean, it goes everything with these people.
[00:42:53.974 --> 00:42:57.755]  Hillary Clinton colluding with Russia, giving Putin the Uranium One deal.
[00:42:57.755 --> 00:42:58.355]  I mean, it's everything.
[00:42:59.349 --> 00:43:03.294]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:43:03.294 --> 00:43:06.578]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:43:06.578 --> 00:43:12.867]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:43:12.867 --> 00:43:15.630]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:43:16.371 --> 00:43:20.176]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:43:20.176 --> 00:43:26.665]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:43:26.665 --> 00:43:31.632]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:43:32.372 --> 00:43:36.295]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:43:36.295 --> 00:43:43.499]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:43:43.499 --> 00:43:48.723]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:43:48.723 --> 00:43:54.406]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:43:54.406 --> 00:43:58.389]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:43:59.491 --> 00:44:04.334]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:44:04.334 --> 00:44:13.801]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[00:44:13.801 --> 00:44:18.604]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[00:44:18.604 --> 00:44:28.831]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support
[00:44:28.831 --> 00:44:29.151]  I think so.
[00:45:00.436 --> 00:45:02.678]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[00:45:02.678 --> 00:45:04.419]  There is no set stasis.
[00:45:04.419 --> 00:45:05.660]  There is no managed system.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:07.321]  There is no un-continuum.
[00:45:07.321 --> 00:45:10.543]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[00:45:10.543 --> 00:45:13.885]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[00:45:13.885 --> 00:45:15.146]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:15.926]  We'll be here forever.
[00:45:15.926 --> 00:45:17.187]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[00:45:17.187 --> 00:45:24.072]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[00:45:24.072 --> 00:45:24.632]  We made it.
[00:45:24.632 --> 00:45:26.793]  And that's really where this goes.
[00:45:26.793 --> 00:45:28.615]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[00:45:28.615 --> 00:45:28.975]  And so,
[00:45:29.175 --> 00:45:35.782]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[00:45:35.782 --> 00:45:40.707]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[00:45:40.707 --> 00:45:43.571]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[00:45:43.571 --> 00:45:45.953]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[00:45:45.953 --> 00:45:49.477]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[00:45:49.477 --> 00:45:50.498]  I want to go to the next level.
[00:45:50.738 --> 00:45:53.862]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[00:45:53.862 --> 00:45:55.023]  Not these devil worshippers.
[00:45:55.023 --> 00:45:57.906]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[00:45:57.906 --> 00:45:58.967]  I want life!
[00:45:58.967 --> 00:46:00.269]  I want Jesus!
[00:46:00.269 --> 00:46:01.930]  Defeat the globalists.
[00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:03.672]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:03.672 --> 00:46:05.174]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[00:46:05.174 --> 00:46:06.255]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:07.216 --> 00:46:12.099]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:12.099 --> 00:46:15.922]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:15.922 --> 00:46:24.908]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:24.908 --> 00:46:34.275]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[00:46:34.955 --> 00:46:38.918]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[00:46:38.918 --> 00:46:44.883]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[00:46:44.883 --> 00:46:47.905]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:49.406]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:49.406 --> 00:46:52.609]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:59.034]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[00:47:02.825 --> 00:47:19.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.401]  You found it.
[00:47:20.401 --> 00:47:22.482]  The tip of the spear.
[00:47:22.482 --> 00:47:25.625]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:47:25.625 --> 00:47:25.805]  Folks,
[00:47:30.205 --> 00:47:39.924]  We're going to be getting breaking news here shortly from Alex Jones and I just want to explain something in case people can't fully understand what the censorship has done.
[00:47:41.684 --> 00:47:45.887]  Alex is busy dealing with a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff.
[00:47:45.887 --> 00:47:52.010]  Obviously, a lot of this stuff kind of goes into the public with the news they talk about, with the lawsuits and everything.
[00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:54.132]  Obviously, the attack on us, censoring us and everything.
[00:47:54.132 --> 00:48:05.099]  So, what they've done is they've basically put Alex into a box where the only place where he can, at the flick of a switch, reach a million people is right here.
[00:48:05.879 --> 00:48:09.201]  So he can't go live on YouTube and reach a million people with a message.
[00:48:09.201 --> 00:48:14.424]  He can't go live on Facebook or Twitter and reach a million people with a message in the flick of a switch like he used to be able to do.
[00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:25.870]  So, you know, when he's out doing stuff behind the scenes, dealing with all of this stuff on a day like today, it's super frustrating for him because he's got breaking news, there's major developments happening, and
[00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:34.956]  He has to try to deal with everything behind the scenes and somehow get the message into the Alex Jones Show because this is where they've boxed him into.
[00:48:34.956 --> 00:48:38.258]  The last place he can go to get millions of people to hear his message.
[00:48:38.258 --> 00:48:45.963]  So, we got an emergency message coming up from Alex shortly and he's going to be joining us before the end of the show.
[00:48:45.963 --> 00:48:50.587]  And we've got some other stuff I'm going to get to with some guests coming up as well.
[00:48:50.587 --> 00:48:50.747]  But...
[00:48:52.358 --> 00:48:55.141]  I just got this story handed to me.
[00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:58.684]  Suspect attacks Arizona officer charged with terrorism.
[00:48:58.684 --> 00:49:04.109]  And I had, I don't even know what you want to say.
[00:49:04.109 --> 00:49:14.078]  It was like just this humbling moment, but it was really just, it just grounded me in how ridiculous it all really is.
[00:49:14.078 --> 00:49:17.922]  Because in the last year, think about this.
[00:49:19.793 --> 00:49:26.755]  In the last year, the biggest news story has pretty much been the same, as far as what the mainstream media wants to push, and that's Trump bad.
[00:49:26.755 --> 00:49:29.656]  Whether that's Russian collusion, government shutdown, whatever.
[00:49:29.656 --> 00:49:30.937]  Trump bad is the main story, right?
[00:49:30.937 --> 00:49:31.957]  Trump is the worst thing ever.
[00:49:31.957 --> 00:49:35.578]  I mean, you know, you've heard it all.
[00:49:35.578 --> 00:49:44.621]  In the last year, do you know that there have been multiple major terror attacks thwarted in this country?
[00:49:47.628 --> 00:49:55.733]  Last 4th of July you had a radical leftist that was attempting to blow up a 4th of July parade in Cleveland.
[00:49:55.733 --> 00:50:07.880]  You had a compound in New Mexico where two jihadis were training children how to go into schools and murder children.
[00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:13.163]  They also ritualistically sacrificed a child.
[00:50:13.163 --> 00:50:13.664]  No big deal.
[00:50:15.475 --> 00:50:18.497]  There was a huge story, was it yesterday?
[00:50:18.497 --> 00:50:19.137]  Two days ago?
[00:50:19.137 --> 00:50:21.619]  I mean, it's like a blip on the radar.
[00:50:21.619 --> 00:50:25.482]  They just stopped another major terror attack from happening.
[00:50:25.482 --> 00:50:29.524]  There was some guy trying to bomb the White House.
[00:50:29.524 --> 00:50:31.586]  This is like, oh, just a blip on the radar.
[00:50:31.586 --> 00:50:33.467]  Just, oh, terrorist tries to bomb the White House.
[00:50:33.467 --> 00:50:36.989]  Eh, okay, moving on.
[00:50:36.989 --> 00:50:38.610]  And so, now this comes out today.
[00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:44.294]  Suspect attacks Arizona officer charged with multiple accounts of terrorism.
[00:50:46.295 --> 00:50:49.156]  And of course, it's a suspected jihadist.
[00:50:49.156 --> 00:50:51.277]  They believe it could be ISIS-inspired.
[00:50:51.277 --> 00:50:55.759]  And he's got his nice, toxic, masculine, you know, beard, too.
[00:50:55.759 --> 00:50:58.580]  Which is bad, unless it's a Muslim, I suppose.
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.201]  It's a white male, your beard's toxic.
[00:51:00.201 --> 00:51:03.342]  If it's a Muslim, then it's loving.
[00:51:03.342 --> 00:51:08.765]  So, I mean, I'm just sitting here like, oh my God!
[00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:09.185]  We get
[00:51:10.419 --> 00:51:11.039]  Nothing.
[00:51:11.039 --> 00:51:14.020]  You get multiple terror attacks thwarted.
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:15.061]  Could be major terror attacks.
[00:51:15.061 --> 00:51:16.701]  I mean, who knows what's going on here?
[00:51:16.701 --> 00:51:19.742]  A terror compound in New Mexico with dead children.
[00:51:19.742 --> 00:51:22.743]  And you get nothing!
[00:51:22.743 --> 00:51:24.344]  It's like it doesn't even happen!
[00:51:28.191 --> 00:51:31.413]  And then, of course, the news story comes out and goes mainstream yesterday.
[00:51:31.413 --> 00:51:33.035]  All the prayer rugs found at the border.
[00:51:33.035 --> 00:51:35.556]  InfoWars broke that in 2017.
[00:51:35.556 --> 00:51:38.719]  We had an interview where the guy was talking about finding all these prayer rugs.
[00:51:38.719 --> 00:51:40.180]  I don't know what the hell's going on.
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.821]  We claim to be at war with Islam.
[00:51:41.821 --> 00:51:44.763]  We're in seven different Islamic countries.
[00:51:44.763 --> 00:51:51.128]  You know, the Border Patrol says we get people from 48 different countries coming across the border here nearly every day.
[00:51:51.548 --> 00:52:02.018]  You don't think that some of these Muslim countries we've been bombing for years might try to slip some jihadis across that wide open border?
[00:52:02.018 --> 00:52:02.939]  But it doesn't even matter!
[00:52:04.898 --> 00:52:09.739]  It doesn't even matter, it doesn't even matter if they thwart a terror attack attempted on a 4th of July parade.
[00:52:09.739 --> 00:52:12.940]  It doesn't even matter if they thwart a terror attack attempted on the White House.
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.280]  Oh, oh, what was the one?
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:24.162]  They found some like, a bomb that weighed like a ton in some guy's backyard that he was trying to blow up.
[00:52:24.162 --> 00:52:26.883]  I think that was in D.C.
[00:52:26.883 --> 00:52:32.064]  You have video of armed men walking across the border.
[00:52:34.346 --> 00:52:36.027]  This is just, I mean, it's just insane!
[00:52:36.027 --> 00:52:38.848]  It's just, this is lunatic society!
[00:52:38.848 --> 00:52:50.612]  No common sense, no logic, no reasoning, just whatever's politically advantageous for me, whatever's politically correct for me.
[00:52:50.612 --> 00:52:54.414]  Just insane!
[00:52:54.414 --> 00:52:55.674]  Ugh!
[00:52:55.674 --> 00:52:58.355]  But you know what?
[00:52:58.355 --> 00:53:02.317]  The ideological left, the ideological left,
[00:53:04.022 --> 00:53:07.926]  We'll end all borders, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:07.926 --> 00:53:10.948]  And I realized something.
[00:53:10.948 --> 00:53:16.874]  What the real role here is, on an individual level, for someone like myself.
[00:53:16.874 --> 00:53:21.078]  And for you.
[00:53:21.078 --> 00:53:25.782]  The ideological left will end all borders.
[00:53:25.782 --> 00:53:28.405]  I'm not just talking about countries, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:29.534 --> 00:53:34.717]  The ideological left has already ended the borders of human biology.
[00:53:34.717 --> 00:53:39.159]  The ideological left has already ended the borders of human sexuality.
[00:53:39.159 --> 00:53:49.165]  The ideological left has already ended the borders of the innocence of children.
[00:53:49.165 --> 00:53:53.367]  Ending the border of a country is a joke to these people.
[00:53:57.423 --> 00:54:02.845]  Yes, the ideological left will end all borders.
[00:54:02.845 --> 00:54:08.448]  And that's the resistance is victory factor because we have to be a governor on these people.
[00:54:08.448 --> 00:54:10.388]  We have to be a check on these people.
[00:54:10.388 --> 00:54:17.351]  These people want to dive in headfirst into a one inch deep body of water.
[00:54:17.351 --> 00:54:18.872]  And so we're simply saying, look,
[00:54:20.779 --> 00:54:29.606]  You're gonna dive, and we're probably gonna die, so can we at least wait until the water hits, like, 10 feet?
[00:54:29.606 --> 00:54:31.007]  Before we jump to our death?
[00:54:31.007 --> 00:54:37.772]  Like, can we at least try to soften the blow before we jump to our death here?
[00:54:37.772 --> 00:54:38.493]  But that's what it is.
[00:54:38.493 --> 00:54:40.034]  It's all about ending all borders.
[00:54:40.034 --> 00:54:48.300]  The borders of sexuality, the borders of biology, the borders of common sense, the borders of reality, even.
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:48.500]  And see,
[00:54:49.685 --> 00:54:51.607]  I talked about the mental gymnastics of a leftist.
[00:54:51.607 --> 00:54:53.108]  I can't even imagine.
[00:54:53.108 --> 00:55:04.217]  Of course they, they, these people, all the social constructs that they have in their mind, here's why they, here's why the average leftist struggles with society, struggles with reality.
[00:55:04.217 --> 00:55:10.742]  Because all the social constructs that they have, that they've invented, exist only in their minds.
[00:55:10.742 --> 00:55:12.123]  They don't exist in the real world.
[00:55:13.177 --> 00:55:23.481]  So of course, when you go out and you try to apply a leftist ideology to the real world, you're going to be confused and disoriented, which will eventually lead to anger and outrage, which is what we see from these people.
[00:55:23.481 --> 00:55:31.363]  Well, of course, inevitably, that's all you're going to get when the social construct that you've created in your mind only exists in your mind.
[00:55:31.363 --> 00:55:35.085]  And when you try to apply it to reality, it doesn't work.
[00:55:35.085 --> 00:55:37.085]  Of course, you're going to be frustrated.
[00:55:37.085 --> 00:55:41.327]  Of course, you're going to be confused.
[00:55:41.327 --> 00:55:41.507]  But
[00:55:43.951 --> 00:55:54.293]  Again, we're just like a governor here, like, okay, you're going to jump off this cliff, you're going to splatter your brains and guts all over the ground, okay?
[00:55:54.293 --> 00:55:56.053]  You've already decided that.
[00:55:56.053 --> 00:55:58.974]  You've already decided that's what you want to do with humanity, okay?
[00:55:58.974 --> 00:56:06.795]  We're just sitting here trying to hold them back, saying, let's wait until some of the water builds up before we dive headfirst, okay?
[00:56:06.795 --> 00:56:09.876]  Let's maybe 5 feet, 10 feet, 20 feet, maybe we'll survive.
[00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:12.482]  But no, these people are ready to go.
[00:56:12.482 --> 00:56:13.343]  Jump off!
[00:56:13.343 --> 00:56:13.843]  Jump off!
[00:56:13.843 --> 00:56:19.969]  Let's jump into that one inch deep water right now from 50 feet high!
[00:56:19.969 --> 00:56:23.171]  And we're just like, okay, slow down.
[00:56:23.171 --> 00:56:25.513]  This jump will lead to our death.
[00:56:25.513 --> 00:56:28.956]  No it won't, you racist!
[00:56:28.956 --> 00:56:33.080]  All right, so anyway folks, we're gonna have an emergency message from Alex Jones coming up.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:37.464]  I didn't even really get to the news, but it's just, it just all feels so trivial to me.
[00:56:38.598 --> 00:56:47.702]  Because if the person cannot see what's going on in front of their eyes, as far as the corruption, the lies and everything, then what good does it do me covering the news, you know?
[00:56:47.702 --> 00:56:54.965]  If we don't even care about mass terror attacks being thwarted, if we don't care about all the drugs and terror and crime that comes across the... I mean, you know.
[00:56:56.479 --> 00:56:58.220]  What's the big deal?
[00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.423]  Illegal voting in, you know, Washington, D.C.
[00:57:01.423 --> 00:57:05.166]  Continuing the government funding of Planned Parenthood.
[00:57:05.166 --> 00:57:08.849]  You know, new caravans are coming across the border.
[00:57:08.849 --> 00:57:11.351]  I mean, who cares?
[00:57:11.351 --> 00:57:16.696]  We're going to jump off that cliff to our death anyway!
[00:57:16.696 --> 00:57:17.657]  So that's what we've got.
[00:57:17.657 --> 00:57:25.183]  So, we're going to be joined in the next hour by Andrew Lawrence, who confronted that racist professor who says killing white people is a skill.
[00:57:26.247 --> 00:57:27.908]  Okay.
[00:57:27.908 --> 00:57:28.888]  And again, whatever.
[00:57:28.888 --> 00:57:34.251]  This guy's not gonna, he's not gonna stop me from accomplishing whatever I want to do, whatever.
[00:57:34.251 --> 00:57:50.918]  But again, you just have to look at the society and wonder why a statement like that, why you can be racist against white people that's even trained, but if you reversed it, well then, now all of a sudden it's a non-issue.
[00:57:50.918 --> 00:57:54.840]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:59.681]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[00:57:59.681 --> 00:58:02.343]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[00:58:02.343 --> 00:58:06.646]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[00:58:06.646 --> 00:58:14.152]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[00:58:14.152 --> 00:58:16.554]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[00:58:19.992 --> 00:58:21.853]  We have seen what they want to do.
[00:58:21.853 --> 00:58:25.636]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[00:58:25.636 --> 00:58:37.164]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[00:58:37.164 --> 00:58:39.446]  It's the David Knight Show!
[00:58:39.446 --> 00:58:41.908]  Never miss your show, any day.
[00:58:41.908 --> 00:58:42.949]  I mean, what?
[00:58:42.949 --> 00:58:44.210]  I mean, never!
[00:58:50.265 --> 00:58:57.951]  Did you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:57.951 --> 00:59:01.734]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:59:01.734 --> 00:59:10.421]  It is you, the Infowarriors, across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:59:10.421 --> 00:59:15.024]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:15.024 --> 00:59:16.485]  You are the Infowar.
[00:59:16.485 --> 00:59:20.008]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:20.879 --> 00:59:32.048]  Everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:32.048 --> 00:59:40.035]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:40.035 --> 00:59:47.081]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:47.081 --> 00:59:49.823]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[00:59:53.777 --> 00:59:56.383]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:12.256 --> 01:00:14.518]  Waging War on Corruption.
[01:00:14.518 --> 01:00:17.881]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:20.964]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:00:20.964 --> 01:00:27.350]  Alright, we've actually asked this professor, Irami Osai Frimpong,
[01:00:28.234 --> 01:00:32.861]  Who is encouraging people to fight and kill white people.
[01:00:32.861 --> 01:00:34.743]  A total racist.
[01:00:34.743 --> 01:00:36.085]  But he's not racist because he's black.
[01:00:36.085 --> 01:00:37.407]  So you can't be racist if you're black.
[01:00:37.407 --> 01:00:43.295]  One of the biggest... I don't even know how somebody could... Just... Anyway...
[01:00:44.381 --> 01:00:45.541]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:51.204]  See, I had these moments where it's just the reality of the insanity hits you and it's just like, it's like a wall, man.
[01:00:51.204 --> 01:00:53.905]  It's just like it stops you dead in your tracks.
[01:00:53.905 --> 01:01:00.987]  Anyway, one of his students who's going to be joining us this hour, Andrew Lawrence, confronted this racist professor.
[01:01:00.987 --> 01:01:02.808]  Here is how that went.
[01:01:05.938 --> 01:01:11.763]  You said that every suburban community in Georgia raises white supremacists.
[01:01:11.763 --> 01:01:12.984]  How can you possibly say that?
[01:01:12.984 --> 01:01:16.728]  You don't know what every white community in Georgia does.
[01:01:16.728 --> 01:01:17.468]  Pause this real quick.
[01:01:17.468 --> 01:01:19.610]  Pause this real quick.
[01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:21.272]  I haven't seen this video yet.
[01:01:21.272 --> 01:01:25.195]  I can already tell Andrew Lawrence is a toxic masculinity.
[01:01:26.186 --> 01:01:27.287]  Do you hear that man?
[01:01:27.287 --> 01:01:30.631]  Do you hear the confidence in that man's voice to stand up for what he believes in?
[01:01:30.631 --> 01:01:32.312]  What a toxic masculinist.
[01:01:32.312 --> 01:01:34.935]  You see, this is what America has way too much of, folks.
[01:01:34.935 --> 01:01:37.037]  Men who stand up for what they believe in.
[01:01:37.037 --> 01:01:48.169]  Men who aren't going to cowardice to political correctness and bullying and the hate mobs of the left that cry racism whenever they feel embarrassed or upset.
[01:01:48.729 --> 01:02:00.595]  So, so this is the problem with America is men like Andrew Lawrence who stand up for what he believes in and speaks with confidence against racists like Irami Frimpong.
[01:02:00.595 --> 01:02:04.197]  So yeah, this is what they want to end in this country.
[01:02:04.197 --> 01:02:09.060]  They don't want someone to stand up to the leftist brainwashing cult.
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:09.660]  All right, let's go back.
[01:02:12.217 --> 01:02:17.660]  That's an extreme statement.
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:23.705]  I live in one too, and I didn't have the typical heterosexual... No, I'm talking now.
[01:02:23.705 --> 01:02:27.928]  I did not have the same heterosexual experience that people in these communities had.
[01:02:27.928 --> 01:02:31.930]  So how can you generalize me into this stereotype when you don't know my experiences?
[01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:33.912]  You just asked him a question, I was going to answer it, okay?
[01:02:34.432 --> 01:02:36.254]  I don't feel like he's answered my question at all.
[01:02:36.254 --> 01:02:38.175]  I didn't even realize.
[01:02:38.175 --> 01:02:40.297]  Y'all yelled at me while I was trying to ask my question.
[01:02:40.297 --> 01:02:42.318]  Well, if he just asks one, I'll let him answer it.
[01:02:42.318 --> 01:02:44.600]  He can answer it when he's done, he can ask another one.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.601]  Does that sound good?
[01:02:45.601 --> 01:02:46.021]  My gosh.
[01:02:59.235 --> 01:03:01.777]  Higher education in this country is dead.
[01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:02.137]  Dead.
[01:03:28.695 --> 01:03:30.397]  Of course, the reason is that's part of the propaganda.
[01:03:49.889 --> 01:03:55.753]  This is part of the indoctrination that is our higher education system.
[01:03:55.753 --> 01:04:01.278]  But there are people on this campus who are, that he's putting into a box, and that's not appropriate.
[01:04:01.278 --> 01:04:03.940]  Now, think about this, folks.
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:08.183]  This is actually the real dire straits that higher education is in.
[01:04:08.183 --> 01:04:08.924]  My God.
[01:04:18.573 --> 01:04:20.875]  You almost need to shut down these universities at this point.
[01:04:20.875 --> 01:04:21.956]  I mean, this is out of control.
[01:04:21.956 --> 01:04:23.517]  Think about it, though.
[01:04:23.517 --> 01:04:28.240]  A class of people... Look, most of the students in that class, probably 50% or more, they probably have no idea.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.602]  They are clueless to anything going on.
[01:04:29.602 --> 01:04:32.143]  They're just in there to go to college, get the grade, and get out.
[01:04:33.448 --> 01:04:39.754]  But ideologically, that individual, Andrew Lawrence, who's about to join us, probably a few and far between up there.
[01:04:39.754 --> 01:04:43.117]  But see, the professor goes against his opinion.
[01:04:43.117 --> 01:04:45.219]  The brainwashed minions goes against an opinion.
[01:04:45.219 --> 01:04:47.641]  So he's just out there, a man on an island.
[01:04:47.641 --> 01:04:48.922]  What's he supposed to do?
[01:04:48.922 --> 01:04:50.343]  How's he supposed to graduate?
[01:04:50.343 --> 01:04:52.125]  How's he supposed to share his ideas?
[01:04:52.125 --> 01:04:53.946]  How's he supposed to expand his mind?
[01:04:53.946 --> 01:04:55.007]  He's not!
[01:04:55.007 --> 01:04:55.728]  He's not welcome!
[01:04:58.331 --> 01:05:01.393]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[01:05:01.393 --> 01:05:04.354]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:05:04.354 --> 01:05:07.275]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[01:05:07.275 --> 01:05:11.337]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patriotic supply.
[01:05:12.901 --> 01:05:22.046]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:05:22.046 --> 01:05:27.388]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:05:27.388 --> 01:05:29.670]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:33.191]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:34.672]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:05:34.672 --> 01:05:38.654]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:05:38.654 --> 01:05:40.895]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:41.956]  Have you got a three-year supply?
[01:05:42.416 --> 01:05:44.398]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:05:44.398 --> 01:05:46.900]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:51.945]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:51.945 --> 01:05:57.330]  InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsSelect, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:06:08.308 --> 01:06:09.449]  Big Brother.
[01:06:09.449 --> 01:06:11.231]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:11.231 --> 01:06:13.134]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:13.134 --> 01:06:14.835]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:14.835 --> 01:06:16.477]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:16.477 --> 01:06:21.603]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:24.626]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:34.716 --> 01:06:46.368]  Ladies and gentlemen of the United States, ladies and gentlemen of the entire planet, this is the most important emergency transmission we've ever put out by magnitudes.
[01:06:46.368 --> 01:06:51.514]  At one o'clock central today, I will lay out the confirmed plan.
[01:06:53.078 --> 01:06:59.144]  That we have discovered and have personally been targeted by rogue criminal elements in the U.S.
[01:06:59.144 --> 01:07:12.738]  government working with multinationals to overthrow the 2016 election and arrest President Trump and Vice President Pence, declaring that they are involved in espionage for the Russians with no proof.
[01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:17.419]  They have to do that with this type of impeachment.
[01:07:17.419 --> 01:07:19.541]  Because if they don't, Pence will still be in.
[01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:24.125]  It has to be foreign meddling, false election.
[01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:27.348]  Once that's done, Nancy Pelosi, under the Constitution, will be the new president.
[01:07:27.348 --> 01:07:31.051]  She can appoint her vice president, and you bet you know who that is.
[01:07:31.051 --> 01:07:32.232]  Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[01:07:32.232 --> 01:07:34.554]  This is the plan.
[01:07:34.554 --> 01:07:37.117]  Now, in the last year, Robert Mueller has tried to set me up.
[01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:40.662]  And it is blaring.
[01:07:40.662 --> 01:07:42.503]  We have the evidence.
[01:07:42.503 --> 01:08:02.467]  But this latest action, via contact from the Washington Post and others, we've confirmed by researching with other sources that they are preparing to attempt to take down InfoWars, arrest myself and my father, as well as Roger Stone.
[01:08:02.467 --> 01:08:07.688]  That's why they've been moving so hard to demonize my name and lie about me and shut us off the air.
[01:08:09.221 --> 01:08:12.763]  And to get us silenced so they can then frame us.
[01:08:12.763 --> 01:08:15.204]  So all of us are in this together.
[01:08:15.204 --> 01:08:17.305]  This is America's darkest hour.
[01:08:17.305 --> 01:08:19.566]  We're fighting for our very existence.
[01:08:19.566 --> 01:08:23.748]  The president means well and works hard and has good ideas and policies.
[01:08:24.608 --> 01:08:28.971]  But he's absolutely surrounded by traitors and yes men.
[01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:29.891]  Carter Carlson's right.
[01:08:29.891 --> 01:08:36.535]  He doesn't know what he's doing in general when it comes to who he appoints and who he brings in.
[01:08:36.535 --> 01:08:42.679]  Evidenced by this new Attorney General nominee that the deep state is licking its lips over.
[01:08:42.679 --> 01:08:46.361]  So they are making their move on the President.
[01:08:46.361 --> 01:08:51.304]  And we have to get the word out about this criminal conspiracy by a rogue group
[01:08:52.657 --> 01:08:53.038]  I don't know.
[01:09:05.976 --> 01:09:07.436]  From this tyranny, in my view.
[01:09:07.436 --> 01:09:09.257]  It'll be very, very hard.
[01:09:09.257 --> 01:09:15.338]  The chips are down here, ladies and gentlemen, but we have truth on our side and we're still on the air at this critical point.
[01:09:15.338 --> 01:09:23.859]  But they need to get us off the air before they make the move on Trump and on Pence, before they install President Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:28.300]  They've got the women all fired up with all the TV shows and movies about woman power against men.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.821]  That was already their plan when Hillary got in, to have a culture war.
[01:09:33.192 --> 01:09:40.978]  Now they're going ahead with that blueprint and they're going to install these women via a fraudulent coup by the rogue FBI.
[01:09:40.978 --> 01:09:48.404]  Pray to God that the people's eyes be open and call everyone you know, text message them, email, go out there and say this is it.
[01:09:48.404 --> 01:09:49.825]  They're moving on Alex Jones.
[01:09:49.825 --> 01:09:51.346]  They're moving on his father.
[01:09:51.346 --> 01:09:52.547]  They're moving on
[01:09:53.388 --> 01:09:54.269]  Roger Stone.
[01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:55.649]  They're moving on myself.
[01:09:55.649 --> 01:09:56.930]  They're moving on my father.
[01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:59.011]  They're moving against you.
[01:09:59.011 --> 01:10:01.092]  They're moving against the free press.
[01:10:01.092 --> 01:10:04.474]  And they're targeting real Americans that stand up for the country.
[01:10:04.474 --> 01:10:11.118]  They're claiming that we are foreign enemies, when they themselves are literally in bed with the shycoms, the Russians, anybody else that'll pay them.
[01:10:12.281 --> 01:10:15.342]  You know, I've called Mueller a Russian agent for tarmacs and uranium.
[01:10:15.342 --> 01:10:17.083]  That's not really what he is.
[01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:20.705]  He's a pimp that sells out America to any foreign bidder he can.
[01:10:20.705 --> 01:10:24.367]  He's a thug gangster from his days with Whitey Bulger.
[01:10:24.367 --> 01:10:29.929]  And if America doesn't stand up against these monsters, there's no coming back.
[01:10:29.929 --> 01:10:34.151]  One o'clock today, coming up, I'm gonna lay it all out.
[01:10:34.151 --> 01:10:35.732]  Emergency transmission.
[01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:37.793]  You are the modern Paul Revere.
[01:10:37.793 --> 01:10:39.234]  Please, join us in one hour.
[01:10:42.418 --> 01:10:43.700]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:52.952]  We will be joined by Alex Jones in under an hour now to break this all down.
[01:10:52.952 --> 01:10:54.114]  What else is there to say, folks?
[01:10:55.444 --> 01:10:57.045]  What else is there to say?
[01:10:57.045 --> 01:11:03.969]  You are witnessing a direct coup against the President of the United States.
[01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:09.173]  You are looking at a direct coup against the Republic.
[01:11:09.173 --> 01:11:12.935]  You are looking at a direct coup against free speech.
[01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:14.496]  It's all happening right now.
[01:11:14.496 --> 01:11:19.459]  And on the other side of this is total tyranny and the end of America.
[01:11:19.459 --> 01:11:23.662]  And if you don't understand that, you don't understand anything.
[01:11:25.018 --> 01:11:32.683]  And we're joined now by Andrew Lawrence, which this all ties together, actually, Andrew.
[01:11:32.683 --> 01:11:42.989]  Part of the reason why they're able to demonize Alex Jones and demonize Trump is because of the indoctrination we see at a university level.
[01:11:42.989 --> 01:11:51.434]  Now, I feel like my generation of millennials was, specifically my age of 29, I feel like I was right on the edge
[01:11:52.234 --> 01:12:00.778]  Of still kind of being like a 90s baby and not having the full 100% indoctrination in the schools and in the media and everywhere.
[01:12:00.778 --> 01:12:03.619]  It was like 60, 70% with us, depends where you look.
[01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:08.581]  You know, we still played on bicycles and actually went to the park, not on social media.
[01:12:08.581 --> 01:12:17.944]  You know, if you wanted to find out what people were doing, you rode your bike around the neighborhood, see where all the bikes were, not getting on social media, see where people are, you know, tagged in or whatever.
[01:12:17.944 --> 01:12:20.986]  So I honestly, I can't even imagine what it's like for you
[01:12:21.926 --> 01:12:23.407]  Being on a college campus like this.
[01:12:23.407 --> 01:12:27.609]  I mean, I wasn't really politically inclined when I was at a university, but I was always a contrarian.
[01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:33.012]  And so I would get in political discussions and all kinds of discussions, and it was always well, you know, fun and mannered.
[01:12:33.012 --> 01:12:34.132]  Nobody hated you.
[01:12:34.132 --> 01:12:37.214]  You know, you didn't have everybody, including the professor, ganging up against you.
[01:12:37.214 --> 01:12:42.056]  But it seems like that's what it is to be a conservative at college campuses these days.
[01:12:42.056 --> 01:12:45.478]  So we'll get into this more on the other side and detailed about your
[01:12:46.338 --> 01:12:48.639]  What is it like being a conservative on campus these days?
[01:12:48.639 --> 01:12:51.260]  Is it really as bad as it seems to those on the outside looking in?
[01:13:02.285 --> 01:13:03.766]  Absolutely.
[01:13:03.766 --> 01:13:18.312]  You know, there is a movement on college campuses across the country for students to buy into this narrative that we constantly have to apologize for oppression that happened hundreds of years ago.
[01:13:19.313 --> 01:13:32.764]  That we have to now accept new ideas and relearn things that are basic knowledge that we've learned about gender, about sex, about roles and masculinity.
[01:13:32.764 --> 01:13:39.050]  And this group speak on college campuses and university campuses.
[01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:46.496]  When you go up against that and you challenge the establishment on these campuses, you're isolated, you're ostracized, you're criticized.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:56.544]  And it's unsafe sometimes for these students to go up against these individuals who are pushing for you to buy into these ideas.
[01:13:56.544 --> 01:13:59.506]  Well, and I look at this and I say, what's the point of you even going to college now?
[01:13:59.506 --> 01:14:00.586]  I mean, what's the point?
[01:14:00.586 --> 01:14:02.327]  You're not allowed to have your ideas.
[01:14:02.327 --> 01:14:03.848]  You're not allowed to speak freely.
[01:14:03.848 --> 01:14:08.630]  If you do, and then your professor learns about your political beliefs, he'll fail you or she'll fail you.
[01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:12.012]  So I'm looking at this like, what's the point of a conservative even going to college anymore?
[01:14:12.012 --> 01:14:12.752]  They're not welcome!
[01:14:13.968 --> 01:14:24.134]  Well, you know, there is a certain irony to me when universities constantly are putting in initiatives to create more diversity on campuses.
[01:14:24.134 --> 01:14:28.396]  They want everyone to look different, but they want everyone to think the same way.
[01:14:28.396 --> 01:14:35.320]  And if you don't think the way that the majority of students on campus think, then you open yourself up to lots of criticism.
[01:14:36.476 --> 01:14:46.947]  Well that's very well said and I remember, again, I try to apply my experience with things to try to get a better picture when I talk about stuff like this.
[01:14:46.947 --> 01:14:47.788]  I remember, I mean, I had...
[01:14:49.116 --> 01:14:57.824]  I studied psychology and media, and I remember I had a cross-cultural psychology professor who was definitely a liberal.
[01:14:57.824 --> 01:15:04.710]  I mean, I knew he was a liberal because I talked to him outside of class, but in class when he was teaching, you would know it!
[01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:09.294]  He just taught you the class and he made sure that he did not inject his politics into it.
[01:15:09.294 --> 01:15:10.576]  Same with history classes I took.
[01:15:10.576 --> 01:15:12.938]  I remember I got real close to a history professor.
[01:15:12.938 --> 01:15:14.499]  She was one of the most amazing professors ever.
[01:15:15.723 --> 01:15:18.704]  Dr. McVicker, and she was a total conservative.
[01:15:18.704 --> 01:15:20.145]  You would never know it being in her class.
[01:15:20.145 --> 01:15:21.465]  She taught the class.
[01:15:21.465 --> 01:15:29.808]  It seems like professors now have this urge or maybe it's like this comfort to politicize their class now.
[01:15:29.808 --> 01:15:30.588]  They do.
[01:15:30.588 --> 01:15:41.632]  You know, I have a certain respect for professors on campuses that present information in an objective way and allow students to decide for themselves what it is that they believe and what they don't believe.
[01:15:42.426 --> 01:15:44.990]  And that's not what we're seeing on college campuses right now.
[01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:48.315]  There's a lot of subjective information being presented to students.
[01:15:48.315 --> 01:15:50.558]  Yeah, it's not a rape culture on college campus.
[01:15:50.558 --> 01:15:53.303]  It's a leftist, liberal, progressive, bullying culture.
[01:15:53.303 --> 01:15:53.984]  That's what it is.
[01:15:53.984 --> 01:15:55.106]  We'll be right back with Andrew Lawrence.
[01:15:55.106 --> 01:15:55.606]  Don't go anywhere.

[01:20:39.333 --> 01:20:39.533]  In fact,
[01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:47.571]  I was talking to some people last night about what's about to happen in the next 48 hours, and it could be insane.
[01:20:47.571 --> 01:20:48.811]  And of course, we'll be in D.C.

[01:21:09.535 --> 01:21:18.463]  Patronizing that is just a fact but the good news is we've got great products and great specials like 50% off bodies right now.
[01:21:18.463 --> 01:21:19.985]  I get so many different
[01:21:21.383 --> 01:21:39.032]  Comments on bodies for how it's worked for people and from a wide range of just personal testimony that I've get I have people that talk about working heavy labor jobs like construction and such Where they get a lot of inflammation and soreness from working with jackhammers and you know sledgehammers and with their hands
[01:21:39.972 --> 01:21:46.874]  And they say bodies, they hit it two bodies every night and it relieves so much of that day-to-day ache and pain.
[01:21:46.874 --> 01:21:54.936]  I have people that work on their feet all day long, chefs that work eight, ten hour shifts running around kitchens on their feet for non-stop long hours.
[01:21:54.936 --> 01:22:01.077]  They tell me the knees and their ankles where they have soreness and inflammation, they take the bodies, relieves it all away.
[01:22:01.077 --> 01:22:03.938]  And another person tell me they get their sinuses
[01:22:05.397 --> 01:22:07.118]  Swollen and inflamed all the time.
[01:22:07.118 --> 01:22:10.701]  They said bodies helped with that So that was kind of out of left field.
[01:22:10.701 --> 01:22:28.534]  Someone told me that for me I like it because I for example last night I was where I worked out for about two and a half hours and so normally Normally today after a workout like that where I did a lot of heavy lifting my legs would be sore My legs would be like wet noodles and there'd be a lot of soreness and inflammation.
[01:22:28.534 --> 01:22:30.515]  I took the bodies after the workout and
[01:22:30.955 --> 01:22:31.515]  Nothing today.
[01:22:31.515 --> 01:22:34.376]  A little stretch in the morning, all the soreness, all the aching is gone.
[01:22:34.376 --> 01:22:36.197]  So try bodies for yourself.
[01:22:36.197 --> 01:22:40.678]  Wide range of positive effects from the bodies.
[01:22:40.678 --> 01:22:44.019]  But read all the reviews for yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:22:59.832 --> 01:23:05.338]  All right, my guest, Andrew Lawrence, graduated from the University of Georgia and
[01:23:07.941 --> 01:23:24.467]  You've seen probably the video of either his racist professor, you know, talking about how bad white people are, time to start killing white people, or perhaps the video of him confronting his professor where he's a man on an island and, you know, it's all about, you know, being a progressive liberal in a university.
[01:23:24.467 --> 01:23:28.529]  That's how you get an A. If you're a thinking man, you get an F and you get kicked out.
[01:23:28.529 --> 01:23:30.949]  It makes you wonder what the point of a university is anymore.
[01:23:30.949 --> 01:23:34.671]  But, Andrew, let's actually talk about this professor, what the class was like,
[01:23:35.331 --> 01:23:40.373]  And what motivated you to stand up like that and record the video?
[01:23:40.373 --> 01:23:59.419]  So at the time that the video was recorded, which was actually back in September, I was a student journalist at the University of Georgia and I had written several stories about this TA before who happened to have been teaching several solo courses in the philosophy department.
[01:23:59.419 --> 01:24:01.819]  He gave me plenty of material.
[01:24:01.819 --> 01:24:03.540]  There's years worth of
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:04.600]  We're good.
[01:24:28.459 --> 01:24:47.777]  During the time that I was covering this professor, he had been invited to a Young Democrats meeting on campus at the University of Georgia, and I decided to attend the meeting and listen to what he had to say, and then during the Q&A portion, I would ask him some questions about how he could possibly
[01:24:48.823 --> 01:24:57.907]  You know, advocate for equality and rights among groups, but say something so inflammatory about the white community.
[01:24:57.907 --> 01:25:02.549]  How can you isolate one community but advocate for equality?
[01:25:02.549 --> 01:25:04.510]  So I went to the meeting.
[01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:06.911]  I waited until the Q&A session.
[01:25:06.911 --> 01:25:08.812]  No one had a question but me.
[01:25:08.812 --> 01:25:14.234]  I raised my hand and I began to read or reference several of his tweets.
[01:25:14.234 --> 01:25:17.616]  Before I could even get through the first or second, I was interrupted.
[01:25:18.684 --> 01:25:19.644]  Insulted.
[01:25:19.644 --> 01:25:20.784]  People were yelling at me.
[01:25:20.784 --> 01:25:22.825]  I couldn't ask my question.
[01:25:22.825 --> 01:25:29.246]  It was a very frustrating experience and at that time I just pulled out my phone and I started recording.
[01:25:29.246 --> 01:25:46.870]  I felt like I was seeing firsthand so many of the things I had seen on Twitter and on Facebook and on Fox News and, you know, of students trying to take a stand against this type of rhetoric and being met with pushback from their peers and from someone who is paid by the university.
[01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:53.234]  So, I started recording and the rest, I guess, is kind of history.
[01:25:53.234 --> 01:25:55.796]  He insulted me several different times.
[01:25:55.796 --> 01:26:00.259]  He told me to shut my yap when I was continuing to ask my question.
[01:26:00.259 --> 01:26:09.786]  He went on and said something to the effect of people who are born in the South and raised with manners use manners as a way of sustaining oppression.
[01:26:09.786 --> 01:26:11.908]  I mean, just really off the wall
[01:26:12.503 --> 01:26:14.385]  Well, I've been to SEC country.
[01:26:14.385 --> 01:26:15.827]  I mean, let's call it SEC country.
[01:26:15.827 --> 01:26:16.548]  I've been to Georgia.
[01:26:16.548 --> 01:26:19.372]  You know, I've been around people like this.
[01:26:30.845 --> 01:26:32.486]  Where does he get this idea?
[01:26:32.486 --> 01:26:36.489]  I mean, people in the Southern Bible Belt are mostly conservative.
[01:26:36.489 --> 01:26:38.630]  I mean, you look at Georgia's voting base.
[01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:41.412]  I mean, that's a very conservative red state.
[01:26:41.412 --> 01:26:42.833]  I mean, so I'm just confused.
[01:26:42.833 --> 01:26:46.295]  Where is he even getting these ideas?
[01:26:46.295 --> 01:26:49.137]  Southern culture, to me, is very conservative.
[01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:52.199]  And it doesn't matter what color your skin is.
[01:26:52.199 --> 01:26:53.660]  People do like manners down there.
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:54.861]  They do shake your hand.
[01:26:54.861 --> 01:26:55.882]  They do look you in the eye.
[01:26:55.882 --> 01:26:57.043]  I mean, where is he?
[01:26:57.043 --> 01:26:57.883]  Let me guess.
[01:26:57.883 --> 01:26:59.784]  This guy's probably not even from the South.
[01:26:59.784 --> 01:27:00.225]  Am I wrong?
[01:27:00.965 --> 01:27:02.187]  He's not from the South.
[01:27:02.187 --> 01:27:05.713]  He was raised in California and did his undergraduate work at UC Berkeley.
[01:27:06.451 --> 01:27:07.471]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:07.471 --> 01:27:08.172]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:27:08.172 --> 01:27:10.373]  You go to Athens, Georgia.
[01:27:10.373 --> 01:27:12.293]  You go to Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
[01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:13.214]  You go to Kennesaw.
[01:27:13.214 --> 01:27:14.634]  You go to these areas.
[01:27:14.634 --> 01:27:16.395]  I mean, this is the Bible Belt.
[01:27:16.395 --> 01:27:18.095]  This is SEC country.
[01:27:18.095 --> 01:27:19.656]  Very conservative people.
[01:27:19.656 --> 01:27:21.817]  And it's not even necessarily politically conservative.
[01:27:21.817 --> 01:27:23.457]  Just like manners.
[01:27:23.457 --> 01:27:23.958]  So let me guess.
[01:27:23.958 --> 01:27:27.279]  This guy from California probably never has said thank you.
[01:27:27.279 --> 01:27:28.259]  Never shook someone's hand.
[01:27:28.259 --> 01:27:31.000]  Just probably some grublet from the West Coast.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.961]  Goes down to Georgia where people shake your hand.
[01:27:33.961 --> 01:27:35.122]  Where people tuck their shirt in.
[01:27:35.322 --> 01:27:36.963]  Where people comb their hair.
[01:27:36.963 --> 01:27:38.063]  Where people take a shower.
[01:27:38.063 --> 01:27:41.885]  And he's just like, oh my gosh, this is oppressing to me!
[01:27:41.885 --> 01:27:44.286]  I want to look like a slovenly bum!
[01:27:44.286 --> 01:27:53.510]  And so he considers it oppression because he's now in a culture where people actually like to comb their hair and have a nice shirt and shake people's hands and smile and say thank you ma'am.
[01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:58.252]  So it was like an actual culture that's like uplifting and loving is what upset him.
[01:28:00.012 --> 01:28:01.793]  Yeah, it definitely seems that way.
[01:28:01.793 --> 01:28:16.121]  He made several posts on Facebook that said that every rural community in Georgia raises white supremacists, that the public school systems in Georgia raise white supremacists, and what is the most startling is that the university has seemed to
[01:28:16.761 --> 01:28:32.732]  To support this rhetoric, they put out two statements yesterday, one over Twitter and one that was emailed to me from the Equal Opportunity Office, where they said that they're not going to hold him accountable for these statements because they were supposedly made on a private forum.
[01:28:32.732 --> 01:28:34.934]  I didn't know Twitter was a private forum or Facebook.
[01:28:36.135 --> 01:28:46.245]  Oh, but you know that same principle would apply if a conservative professor went on the internet on a private platform and was talking positively about Trump.
[01:28:46.245 --> 01:28:49.269]  Or let's even go down the negative road here.
[01:28:49.269 --> 01:28:54.033]  If they were talking actual racist stuff against black people, they'd be kicked out and fired immediately.
[01:28:54.033 --> 01:28:55.795]  So it's just a total double standard.
[01:28:55.795 --> 01:28:56.216]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:56.994 --> 01:28:59.356]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[01:28:59.356 --> 01:29:02.238]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[01:29:02.238 --> 01:29:07.302]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[01:29:07.302 --> 01:29:14.487]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[01:29:14.487 --> 01:29:19.051]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:23.261]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[01:29:23.261 --> 01:29:26.382]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[01:29:26.382 --> 01:29:29.023]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[01:29:29.023 --> 01:29:30.523]  Get sober now.
[01:29:30.523 --> 01:29:33.864]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[01:29:33.864 --> 01:29:34.644]  It's simple.
[01:29:34.644 --> 01:29:37.885]  Just call Elite Rehab Placement right now.
[01:29:37.885 --> 01:29:39.166]  Please, don't wait.
[01:29:39.166 --> 01:29:40.366]  Your life matters to us.
[01:29:40.606 --> 01:29:41.947]  800-213-9264 800-213-9264 800-213-9264 Call right now before it's too late.
[01:29:41.947 --> 01:29:45.888]  800-213-9264 Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:30:03.416 --> 01:30:12.123]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:30:12.123 --> 01:30:14.085]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:30:14.085 --> 01:30:17.547]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:30:17.547 --> 01:30:20.170]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:30:20.170 --> 01:30:22.451]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:30:22.451 --> 01:30:25.154]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is,
[01:30:25.774 --> 01:30:29.963]  And understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target.
[01:30:29.963 --> 01:30:34.874]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[01:30:36.024 --> 01:30:39.747]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:30:39.747 --> 01:30:40.928]  We'll win.

[01:30:50.976 --> 01:30:54.679]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Glove will swing wind.
[01:30:54.679 --> 01:30:56.241]  This is InfoWars Darkness Hour.
[01:30:56.241 --> 01:30:57.101]  We need your support.

[01:32:06.179 --> 01:32:07.421]  Believe me, I know.
[01:32:07.421 --> 01:32:11.926]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:32:11.926 --> 01:32:15.411]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[01:32:15.891 --> 01:32:17.572]  I still have that energy.
[01:32:17.572 --> 01:32:37.717]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[01:33:01.138 --> 01:33:03.781]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.576 --> 01:33:18.858]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[01:33:18.858 --> 01:33:24.901]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.901 --> 01:33:28.044]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:28.044 --> 01:33:32.747]  So there's an interesting dynamic here that I want to discuss with my guest, Andrew Lawrence.
[01:33:33.767 --> 01:33:38.231]  Recently graduated from the University of Georgia, studying political science.
[01:33:38.231 --> 01:33:47.660]  And he's recently gotten some fame and popularity for standing up to a racist leftist professor in a video that went viral.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:53.185]  Of course, this professor has tons of videos on the internet and posts where he's talking about anti-white garbage.
[01:33:53.185 --> 01:33:53.866]  And that's fine.
[01:33:53.866 --> 01:33:55.688]  I mean, look, I don't care.
[01:33:55.688 --> 01:33:57.769]  This professor can be as racist as he wants.
[01:33:58.710 --> 01:34:03.771]  But let's at least have a one standard policy here for racism in America.
[01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:11.773]  And, you know, let's apply the same rules to him that we would a white professor that would say negative things about black people, if that was even happening.
[01:34:11.773 --> 01:34:13.073]  I'm not seeing those videos.
[01:34:13.073 --> 01:34:22.155]  But here's the here's the dynamic that is going through my head with this, Andrew, because I have a lot of young people that ask me,
[01:34:23.607 --> 01:34:29.161]  for advice as far as specifically people getting out of high school and uh...
[01:34:31.263 --> 01:34:44.773]  I kind of used to go with the same notion, which was, look, if you know what you want to do and you're sure about it, and quite frankly, if your parents are going to pay for it, then going to a university is probably the best bet for you.
[01:34:44.773 --> 01:34:57.322]  If you're not sure, but you do want to go to a university, maybe go to a junior college or something for a year or two until you kind of figure it out, and that'll be a little easier on your wallet, a little easier for you to figure out what you want to do.
[01:34:59.454 --> 01:35:01.395]  So that's kind of what I said.
[01:35:01.395 --> 01:35:07.737]  Or I said, look, you know, if you already know what you want to do and you have an outlet for that and a passion and a motivation, just don't even go to college, quite frankly.
[01:35:07.737 --> 01:35:14.119]  Because most of these degrees you're going to get, you either won't need it and it'll just be a resume builder, unless you're like an engineer or a doctor.
[01:35:14.119 --> 01:35:21.142]  But there's a new dynamic that I think is playing out at the university level now, Andrew, and that's this.
[01:35:22.944 --> 01:35:30.306]  I look at the university now, and I almost can't even tell young students to go to college anymore.
[01:35:30.306 --> 01:35:39.128]  I don't even think I can say that with, again, unless your parents want to pay for it, you already got it all figured out, you want to be an engineer or doctor, then fine.
[01:35:39.128 --> 01:35:44.469]  Other than that, I just don't see a college education benefiting people very much anymore.
[01:35:44.469 --> 01:35:48.270]  It's a resume builder, but is it really worth 60, 70, 80 grand, whatever you pay for it?
[01:35:49.892 --> 01:35:58.818]  But there's a new almost level to this where, and I don't even know how to approach this Andrew, I want to know what you think about this.
[01:35:58.818 --> 01:36:09.886]  It's almost as if, because if you want to fight the war that's happening at the college level right now, if you want to fight the indoctrination that's happening at universities right now, well what are you going to do?
[01:36:10.706 --> 01:36:12.047]  If you're not on the inside.
[01:36:12.047 --> 01:36:24.735]  So it's almost like you now have to go to a university, if you're a conservative, you now have to pay to get into a university just to battle the leftist indoctrination.
[01:36:24.735 --> 01:36:33.140]  It's like you can't even go in with the mindset of I'm gonna get straight A's, I'm gonna be a good student, I'm gonna actually be engaged here at this university because you won't get anything.
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:36.743]  You'll get F's, you'll get kicked out of class, you'll be publicly, you know,
[01:36:37.443 --> 01:36:40.085]  You'll be called toxic and everything in between.
[01:36:40.085 --> 01:36:43.087]  So it's like, do you go to college now?
[01:36:43.087 --> 01:36:47.070]  Do you foot that bill to go to college just to battle these people intellectually?
[01:36:47.070 --> 01:36:50.873]  Just to go into the arena as some form of resistance?
[01:36:50.873 --> 01:36:54.876]  Or do you just say, we just have to put the university behind us.
[01:36:54.876 --> 01:36:57.118]  We just have to put the college stuff behind us.
[01:36:57.118 --> 01:36:58.078]  It's gone.
[01:36:58.078 --> 01:36:58.679]  It's gone.
[01:36:58.679 --> 01:37:00.080]  The leftists have destroyed it.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.361]  What do you think we should do with this?
[01:37:02.853 --> 01:37:09.077]  So, I'm going to start off by saying I really do value the education that I got at the University of Georgia.
[01:37:09.077 --> 01:37:14.800]  I wouldn't have spent some of the best years of my life at that university if I didn't love it so much.
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:23.445]  But one thing that I've always said is that we have to stop lying to kids and telling them that it's necessary to go to a four-year university.
[01:37:23.445 --> 01:37:27.127]  It is absolutely not necessary for everybody to go to college.
[01:37:27.127 --> 01:37:28.288]  It's simply not.
[01:37:28.288 --> 01:37:30.129]  I have friends and family members who
[01:37:30.962 --> 01:37:33.203]  Work in various trades.
[01:37:33.203 --> 01:37:34.623]  Some are cosmetologists.
[01:37:34.623 --> 01:37:48.568]  Some are welders that have gone to trade school or gone to some sort of vocational school, and they make better money than some of the people coming out of these prestigious quote-unquote prestigious universities.
[01:37:48.568 --> 01:37:51.529]  I think that we need to start directing kids
[01:37:52.378 --> 01:38:04.023]  In the direction of vocational schools and telling them that, hey, it's okay if you don't want to go to a liberal arts school if you want to go and learn a trade in two years and make double what the kids who do go to liberal arts schools are making.
[01:38:04.023 --> 01:38:18.249]  I think that that's something that we really need to reassess in our educational system because right now telling kids that they have to go to a four-year university is subjecting them to this hateful rhetoric that we're seeing in some of our universities and colleges.
[01:38:18.953 --> 01:38:29.230]  Yeah, and I could see, you know, at one level, it takes time for the college, university structure and setup to catch up with the rest of society.
[01:38:29.230 --> 01:38:30.072]  What I'm talking about here is...
[01:38:31.161 --> 01:38:31.761]  I forget what it was.
[01:38:31.761 --> 01:38:45.090]  There was something I wanted to learn and I remember it was a specific class in college and then I realized I can go online and learn all of it in a week and actually have it applied to something practically within a week.
[01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:49.653]  Something I would spend, it'd probably be a $1,500 course or more at a local university.
[01:38:49.653 --> 01:38:51.474]  It'd take six months or whatever to do it.
[01:38:52.114 --> 01:39:08.758]  So there's kind of that aspect of college where it kind of needs to catch up to the ability of the internet and everything, which takes time and patience and maybe that comes along, but it's the level of indoctrination, to me, that's the real problem here.
[01:39:08.758 --> 01:39:18.980]  I mean, yes, you don't necessarily need a college degree, again, depending on what you want to study, what you want to do, and just the individual, their situation financially and all that stuff, but
[01:39:20.049 --> 01:39:23.771]  I mean, for a lot of people, like learning a foreign language.
[01:39:23.771 --> 01:39:24.971]  You can learn a foreign language.
[01:39:24.971 --> 01:39:35.376]  There's a dozen apps I can download for free on my phone, and I'm more effective learning a foreign language probably there than spending, you know, a couple thousand dollars in a classroom.
[01:39:35.376 --> 01:39:36.857]  So, I mean, what do you see?
[01:39:36.857 --> 01:39:39.458]  I mean, you just, you graduated recently.
[01:39:39.458 --> 01:39:46.441]  I mean, how does the university maintain a competitive ability to educate people with the Internet?
[01:39:48.892 --> 01:40:05.704]  You know, the university systems throughout the country do a very good job of marketing themselves and marketing themselves to students or prospective students in a way that is far more appealing than how vocational schools will market themselves.
[01:40:05.704 --> 01:40:09.647]  Yeah, you got the big football team, you know, the big tailgates and everything, yeah.
[01:40:11.068 --> 01:40:25.791]  So I started at a university in Georgia for my first few years that did not have a football team, that really didn't have a lot going on and had like a fraction of the student body population that the University of Georgia had after I transferred.
[01:40:27.433 --> 01:40:44.384]  You know, there were not a lot of incentives to really go to a smaller university or to go to a vocational school other than the fact that, you know, you might get out a little bit earlier, you can take more classes, or your learning is tailored to a much smaller class size.
[01:40:44.384 --> 01:40:50.989]  But the University of Georgia and universities like it appeal to students because they want that college experience where people go in and
[01:40:51.389 --> 01:40:57.412]  Well, and I think that what you're talking about is actually touching on the answer to my question, which is, what makes college worth it?
[01:41:19.301 --> 01:41:19.722]  You think so?
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:36.360]  Absolutely.
[01:42:02.638 --> 01:42:13.506]  You know, I don't really understand in this particular scenario that we have with this TA at the University of Georgia, why the university is holding on to him.
[01:42:13.506 --> 01:42:18.049]  He is a PhD candidate that just happens to be a TA and teaches a solo course.
[01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:20.270]  He's not a professor with tenure.
[01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:24.413]  So I don't really understand why the university is trying to hold on to him.
[01:42:24.413 --> 01:42:29.236]  Because it seems from this video... Is anyone else standing up against this?
[01:42:29.236 --> 01:42:31.238]  Are you the only one voicing concern over this guy?
[01:42:32.498 --> 01:42:34.180]  I seem to be the only one.
[01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:38.284]  Well, I think you just answered your own question right there, Andrew.
[01:42:38.284 --> 01:42:40.487]  And isn't that the problem with this country?
[01:42:40.487 --> 01:42:42.429]  People aren't willing to stand up for what's right.
[01:42:42.429 --> 01:42:43.730]  But of course, why is that?
[01:42:43.730 --> 01:42:47.534]  Because they'll label you a toxic masculinist.
[01:42:47.534 --> 01:42:48.955]  They'll label you a white supremacist.
[01:42:48.955 --> 01:42:54.241]  This is how they bully people out of sharing their opinion or even telling the truth.
[01:42:54.241 --> 01:42:54.862]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:57.048 --> 01:42:58.709]  Defeat the globalists.
[01:42:58.709 --> 01:43:00.430]  Hashtag Alex Jones.

[01:43:12.697 --> 01:43:20.762]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:21.682 --> 01:43:24.483]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[01:43:24.483 --> 01:43:31.745]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:43:31.745 --> 01:43:35.707]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.

[01:43:41.649 --> 01:43:44.689]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:46.190]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:46.190 --> 01:43:49.231]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[01:43:52.025 --> 01:43:52.867]  We're good.

[01:44:57.791 --> 01:45:07.074]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:45:07.074 --> 01:45:09.934]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:45:09.934 --> 01:45:15.996]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:45:16.656 --> 01:45:22.920]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:29.223]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:45:29.223 --> 01:45:36.147]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:45:37.288 --> 01:45:50.321]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:45:50.321 --> 01:45:54.585]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:45:54.585 --> 01:45:57.268]  X3, now available at mpooler'slife.com.
[01:45:57.984 --> 01:46:00.325]  We all know the importance of fish oils.

[01:47:16.577 --> 01:47:23.621]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.621 --> 01:47:27.302]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:47:27.302 --> 01:47:31.364]  You know, I'm sitting here in the break and kind of reminiscing on some of my college days.
[01:47:31.364 --> 01:47:33.265]  I mean, my God.
[01:47:33.265 --> 01:47:36.167]  College was, like, always kind of out of control at a certain level.
[01:47:37.813 --> 01:47:41.415]  But like, it just all seems to be deteriorating.
[01:47:41.415 --> 01:47:44.656]  It just all just seems to be deteriorating at all levels.
[01:47:44.656 --> 01:47:49.258]  I mean, it's just, it's just so ridiculous, man.
[01:47:49.258 --> 01:47:52.780]  Oh, and so here's the question, because I'm a guy that wants solutions.
[01:47:52.780 --> 01:47:54.301]  I don't claim to have all the solutions.
[01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:58.343]  I try to use logic and reasoning to maybe find options for solutions.
[01:47:58.343 --> 01:48:03.025]  But again, I'm going to ask Andrew this, and let's try to really focus on this, Andrew.
[01:48:04.810 --> 01:48:13.329]  What can we do as Americans to try to save higher education in this country?
[01:48:13.329 --> 01:48:14.692]  Because again, to me...
[01:48:16.437 --> 01:48:34.862]  Doing what you did is one level of this, and I think probably the easiest way to go about this, which is just standing up to these bullies in class, voicing your opinion, not being intimidated, and then the viral video to kind of expose the whole thing to the rest of the nation, and then you hope it kind of catches on as a trend.
[01:48:34.862 --> 01:48:35.283]  Who knows?
[01:48:35.283 --> 01:48:36.143]  Maybe you get a hashtag.
[01:48:37.242 --> 01:48:39.965]  But that's, but then it comes down to this.
[01:48:39.965 --> 01:48:50.755]  It's like, so are we now simply sending our kids, are we just sending people into universities to basically engage in intellectual warfare?
[01:48:50.755 --> 01:48:51.575]  Because you know,
[01:48:52.569 --> 01:48:53.009]  If you go
[01:49:07.757 --> 01:49:09.519]  What do you think the answer is to this riddle?
[01:49:09.519 --> 01:49:10.259]  How do we solve this?
[01:49:10.259 --> 01:49:32.978]  Do we just have to say, alright, we're sending our conservative kids to these universities, and who knows what the outcome is going to be, but they're going to go into these classrooms, they're going to stand up for what they believe in, they're going to stand up for the truth, they're not going to be bullied and intimidated by the leftist indoctrination, or do you just say, okay, we're not sending our kids to these universities anymore, we're just done with the college system, or is there something else?
[01:49:32.978 --> 01:49:34.740]  I mean, what do you think is the solution here, Andrew?
[01:49:36.371 --> 01:49:38.862]  Well, I think there's two parts to it.
[01:49:38.862 --> 01:49:40.690]  One of them that you mentioned earlier was that
[01:49:41.161 --> 01:49:46.224]  You know, the public is just going to have to start standing behind students who call this out.
[01:49:46.224 --> 01:49:49.546]  And I think the second part of it is something that we really haven't discussed.
[01:49:49.546 --> 01:49:56.251]  And that's the boosters and supporters and donors who make significant financial contributions to these schools.
[01:49:56.251 --> 01:50:00.073]  And many, many times their children and their grandchildren go to these schools.
[01:50:00.073 --> 01:50:07.818]  They're going to have to stand up to these universities and say, we are not giving you another dime until something changes on this campus.
[01:50:07.818 --> 01:50:08.599]  Because right now,
[01:50:09.479 --> 01:50:15.423]  These universities are functioning as, you know, as is and the climate there is crumbling.
[01:50:15.423 --> 01:50:27.430]  The prestigious, you know, reputation that these universities have, they're crumbling at the hands of inarticulate, you know, radical professors and TAs like the guy in this video.
[01:50:27.878 --> 01:50:34.063]  Well, that's another issue, is just the bumbling fools that these universities hire as professors.
[01:50:34.063 --> 01:50:35.904]  I mean, I could talk about that.
[01:50:35.904 --> 01:50:37.125]  I almost don't even want to get into that.
[01:50:37.125 --> 01:50:38.886]  It looks like it may be worse than it ever was.
[01:50:38.886 --> 01:50:41.929]  I mean, seriously, that's like insane.
[01:50:41.929 --> 01:50:44.871]  I mean, some of these professors are just bumbling idiots.
[01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:52.277]  Yeah, if you listen to this TA, I mean, and try and really soak up what he's saying,
[01:50:52.722 --> 01:50:54.043]  He's talking in circles.
[01:50:54.043 --> 01:50:55.604]  He's rambling.
[01:50:55.604 --> 01:50:57.104]  It's hard to even... Just look at him!
[01:50:57.104 --> 01:50:59.025]  He's a disheveled bum!
[01:50:59.025 --> 01:51:06.209]  Professors used to show up in suits and ties and bow ties because they wanted to look nice so that the students looked up to him.
[01:51:06.209 --> 01:51:08.170]  This guy shows up like he just rolled out of bed.
[01:51:08.170 --> 01:51:09.451]  Probably smells like it too!
[01:51:12.068 --> 01:51:18.833]  Yeah, the imagery of being an educator in a college or university has definitely changed.
[01:51:18.833 --> 01:51:21.255]  I've seen professors wear pajamas to class before.
[01:51:21.255 --> 01:51:25.398]  I mean, what the heck happened down there in the South, man?
[01:51:25.398 --> 01:51:25.898]  I don't know.
[01:51:25.898 --> 01:51:31.062]  Well, we have professors like this who are permeating our universities that weren't born and raised in the South.
[01:51:31.062 --> 01:51:39.008]  They don't understand our way of life and who don't really understand, you know, the values that many students and their families hold near and dear.
[01:51:39.909 --> 01:51:42.371]  You know, you actually are so smart.
[01:51:42.371 --> 01:51:50.860]  I'm really impressed, because you said something that was actually, that was so spot on, and I already knew this, but saying it, it refreshed in my mind.
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:59.108]  One of the first viral videos exposing the status of college campuses came from the university I went to, University of Missouri-Columbia.
[01:51:59.108 --> 01:51:59.888]  It's known as Mizzou.
[01:52:01.131 --> 01:52:05.932]  Where you had the professor yelling about, you know, your opinion's not welcome here, get out of here, no free speech.
[01:52:05.932 --> 01:52:06.892]  The student's just filming.
[01:52:06.892 --> 01:52:11.973]  It's an Asian student from Webster, Missouri, where I grew up.
[01:52:11.973 --> 01:52:13.353]  And so it became a whole thing.
[01:52:13.353 --> 01:52:20.055]  There was the movement with that young black kid whose father was a multi-millionaire and he was pretending to be oppressed.
[01:52:20.055 --> 01:52:24.255]  It turned out he was getting dropped off by, like, private drivers the whole time.
[01:52:24.255 --> 01:52:26.096]  So the whole thing was basically just a front.
[01:52:28.436 --> 01:52:35.580]  It seems to me that, you know, there's slowly trickling out more videos, slowly more people are kind of realizing it.
[01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:42.144]  But, I mean, I just look back, again, I kind of compare like when I was at the university to what I see now.
[01:52:42.144 --> 01:52:43.944]  It just seems like it's going out of control.
[01:52:43.944 --> 01:52:46.926]  But you hit the head, you hit the nail on the head.
[01:52:46.926 --> 01:52:49.828]  I remember when this stuff started going on at the University of Missouri.
[01:52:49.828 --> 01:52:53.590]  Guys, see if you can find these stories, and I'm serious, I want the crew to actually focus on this and find this.
[01:52:54.995 --> 01:53:07.706]  As soon as that garbage started happening at the University of Missouri, boosters and funders started pulling their funds, and eventually the University of Missouri had to suspend that professor.
[01:53:07.706 --> 01:53:10.648]  I'm not sure if she ever lost her job, but they had to suspend her.
[01:53:10.648 --> 01:53:14.571]  The university president of Mizzou ended up getting ousted, too.
[01:53:14.571 --> 01:53:16.513]  Whether that was good or bad, I think, is up for debate.
[01:53:19.537 --> 01:53:24.639]  This stuff started to go viral from the University of Mizzou with these crazed leftist professors.
[01:53:24.639 --> 01:53:31.301]  Boosters started pulling their funding, it started hurting Mizzou's bottom line, and that's when they finally started moving against some of the professors.
[01:53:31.301 --> 01:53:33.322]  So you're actually spot on.
[01:53:33.322 --> 01:53:36.623]  Now, do you know, though, how do you... I mean, maybe that's the answer here.
[01:53:36.623 --> 01:53:39.884]  Maybe someone has to reach out to the boosters here.
[01:53:39.884 --> 01:53:40.784]  Maybe that's it.
[01:53:40.784 --> 01:53:47.087]  You get the viral videos exposing the professors, and then you send them to all the boosters.
[01:53:47.087 --> 01:53:48.107]  Maybe that's the answer.
[01:53:49.386 --> 01:54:17.792]  Well, what I've been telling people over the last two days since this video was posted was email the Alumni Association, email Boosters, email anyone you know who makes a financial contribution to this university, and tell them to reach out to the EOO, reach out to the legal department, the office of the president, and say, we will not fund this university in any way, shape, or form until this person is no longer in any sort of position to take academic influence over students.
[01:54:21.001 --> 01:54:31.099]  Well, I think that maybe that's what we do, is you motivate more people to stand up like you did and get the videos.
[01:54:31.099 --> 01:54:31.760]  Or, you know, maybe...
[01:54:32.697 --> 01:54:40.183]  Maybe you don't even have to do something where you stand up like that if that's not necessarily your inclination or your nature, but I think that's the key.
[01:54:40.183 --> 01:54:45.468]  The whole university structure is so screwed up, there's so many different issues I could talk about.
[01:54:45.468 --> 01:54:54.135]  My God, the highest paid person at almost any major university is either going to be a football coach or a basketball coach.
[01:54:54.135 --> 01:54:57.158]  Those programs drive the most revenue, yet the students don't get any money.
[01:55:00.658 --> 01:55:12.608]  I mean, it's somehow tapping into that blood vessel of straight cash that funds all these universities, gets them the new uniforms, gets the coaches hired.
[01:55:12.608 --> 01:55:15.751]  I mean, that's what these boosters really only care about, let's be perfectly honest.
[01:55:15.751 --> 01:55:21.235]  They want the football team to win so they can go to the game and eat a bunch of hot dogs and chips and what have you.
[01:55:21.235 --> 01:55:22.697]  So I think that that's the answer.
[01:55:24.209 --> 01:55:29.570]  I mean, they just pulled up the top government, the top salaries at the University of Texas here in Austin.
[01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:31.691]  Guess what?
[01:55:31.691 --> 01:55:42.673]  The biggest salaries for any government employee in Texas is the head basketball and the head football coach at UT!
[01:55:42.673 --> 01:55:44.053]  Oh my God!
[01:55:44.053 --> 01:55:46.834]  So again, this just shows you how out of whack
[01:55:47.674 --> 01:55:49.755]  The entire education system is.
[01:55:49.755 --> 01:55:51.175]  Alright, you know what, Andrew?
[01:55:51.175 --> 01:55:52.235]  We've got two minutes left here.
[01:55:52.235 --> 01:55:54.376]  I want to thank you so much for coming on.
[01:55:54.376 --> 01:55:55.797]  Hopefully some other people interview you.
[01:55:55.797 --> 01:55:58.277]  Apparently no one else has been interested in picking you up as an interview yet.
[01:55:58.277 --> 01:55:59.037]  I'm surprised.
[01:55:59.037 --> 01:56:00.778]  You're very well spoken, very smart.
[01:56:00.778 --> 01:56:02.679]  So final minute and a half here, Andrew.
[01:56:02.679 --> 01:56:03.679]  What do you want to tell our audience?
[01:56:06.082 --> 01:56:13.646]  I want to tell if there are any other students watching, anyone in university right now, and they see this type of thing happening, they need to whip out their phone and record it.
[01:56:13.646 --> 01:56:15.807]  You don't even have to engage like I did.
[01:56:15.807 --> 01:56:28.913]  Like you said, that might not be someone's nature or their inclination, but record it, post it, show it to someone who you know supports your beliefs, because God knows these professors don't and some of your peers don't.
[01:56:29.934 --> 01:56:36.819]  And really try and get the public behind you because right now, from the looks of my university, the administration is not even behind you.
[01:56:37.779 --> 01:56:40.180]  Well, I gotta tell you, you really hit the nail on the head.
[01:56:40.180 --> 01:56:44.463]  If you hit these universities where the cash comes in, that changes everything.
[01:56:44.463 --> 01:56:52.388]  Because the people that run these universities, they live in these huge mansions provided by the university.
[01:56:52.388 --> 01:56:55.370]  Most of these universities run at a tremendous deficit, too.
[01:56:55.370 --> 01:56:59.372]  I think the University of Missouri is like $300 million on the state of Missouri.
[01:56:59.372 --> 01:57:04.575]  They only are able to operate with the major cash that comes in from the boosters.
[01:57:04.575 --> 01:57:05.416]  And these boosters
[01:57:05.996 --> 01:57:09.258]  I have a feeling you don't want to see this leftist indoctrination, but maybe that's the answer.
[01:57:09.258 --> 01:57:10.039]  Maybe we find out.
[01:57:10.039 --> 01:57:11.840]  So thank you so much, Andrew Lawrence, folks.
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:15.863]  Follow him on Twitter at YoungGAGOP.
[01:57:15.863 --> 01:57:20.446]  That's at YoungGAGeorgiaGOP.
[01:57:20.446 --> 01:57:21.106]  Andrew Lawrence.
[01:57:21.106 --> 01:57:23.748]  Follow him on Twitter and reach out to him, folks.
[01:57:23.748 --> 01:57:26.530]  Like he said, if you're a college student, reach out to him.
[01:57:26.530 --> 01:57:27.911]  He can help you find ways to do this.
[01:57:27.911 --> 01:57:32.174]  I mean, if you really want to trigger your professor and get a viral video, wear a MAGA hat to class.
[01:57:33.127 --> 01:57:34.368]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:57:34.368 --> 01:57:36.230]  Wear a Trump shirt to class.
[01:57:36.230 --> 01:57:39.292]  I mean, wear the Ocasio-Cortez shirt right here.
[01:57:39.292 --> 01:57:41.614]  Wear this to your college class right here.
[01:57:41.614 --> 01:57:43.256]  Send us that video.
[01:57:43.256 --> 01:57:44.437]  That's the video I want to see.
[01:57:44.437 --> 01:57:46.839]  You wearing this shirt in class.
[01:57:46.839 --> 01:57:49.081]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[01:57:49.081 --> 01:57:50.822]  There is no set stasis.
[01:57:50.822 --> 01:57:52.063]  There is no managed system.
[01:57:52.063 --> 01:57:53.725]  There is no un-continuum.
[01:57:53.725 --> 01:57:56.387]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[01:57:56.927 --> 01:58:00.269]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[01:58:00.269 --> 01:58:01.509]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[01:58:01.509 --> 01:58:02.289]  We'll be here forever.
[01:58:02.289 --> 01:58:03.570]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[01:58:03.570 --> 01:58:11.013]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[01:58:11.013 --> 01:58:13.174]  And that's really where this goes.
[01:58:13.174 --> 01:58:14.855]  God's got a big war for you, Revy.
[01:58:15.575 --> 01:58:22.162]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[01:58:22.162 --> 01:58:27.087]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[01:58:27.087 --> 01:58:29.970]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:32.352]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[01:58:32.352 --> 01:58:35.856]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[01:58:35.856 --> 01:58:36.897]  I want to go to the next level.
[01:58:37.137 --> 01:58:41.387]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[01:58:41.387 --> 01:58:44.293]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[01:58:44.293 --> 01:58:45.375]  I want life!
[01:58:45.375 --> 01:58:46.197]  I want Jesus!
[01:58:51.793 --> 01:58:57.516]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:58:57.516 --> 01:59:05.381]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:59:05.381 --> 01:59:08.543]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:59:08.743 --> 01:59:14.005]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:59:14.005 --> 01:59:16.765]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:59:16.765 --> 01:59:25.748]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:59:25.928 --> 01:59:37.790]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, pau d'arco bark, and grapeseed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:42.591]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:42.591 --> 01:59:50.432]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:50.432 --> 01:59:53.073]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:03.670 --> 02:00:06.913]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[02:00:06.913 --> 02:00:11.236]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:00:11.236 --> 02:00:25.667]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's partisan politics, there's opinion, there's the left, there's the right, there's conservatism, there's liberalism, there's progressivism.
[02:00:28.234 --> 02:00:36.459]  There's all these different boxes that we may or may not fall into politically, but there's one box that we should all exist in.
[02:00:36.459 --> 02:00:45.924]  And that's common sense, that's logic, that's reasoning, and you'd hope that's putting America first, being proud of your country, being proud of your heritage.
[02:00:45.924 --> 02:00:52.148]  Now, that is not the case, and perhaps even up for a fair debate.
[02:00:52.148 --> 02:00:53.329]  But, Jim Jordan,
[02:00:54.892 --> 02:01:03.954]  Goes to Congress yesterday and delivers a speech, not partisan, not Republican, not conservative, not liberal, not Democrat.
[02:01:03.954 --> 02:01:06.354]  Nothing but just truth.
[02:01:06.354 --> 02:01:08.115]  Nothing but just common sense.
[02:01:08.115 --> 02:01:10.415]  Nothing but just logic.
[02:01:10.415 --> 02:01:15.916]  Nothing but just what America needs to hear.
[02:01:15.916 --> 02:01:19.337]  Here's Jim Jordan's speech to Congress yesterday.
[02:01:19.337 --> 02:01:23.398]  Today's left has taken the most radical positions in American history.
[02:01:24.266 --> 02:01:27.368]  They applaud Kaepernick when he disrespects the flag.
[02:01:27.368 --> 02:01:30.711]  They embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never that great.
[02:01:30.711 --> 02:01:32.792]  We're not going to make America great again.
[02:01:32.792 --> 02:01:35.734]  It was never that great.
[02:01:35.734 --> 02:01:40.698]  And they cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go out and harass anyone who supports the president.
[02:01:40.698 --> 02:01:51.585]  If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd.
[02:01:59.389 --> 02:02:03.131]  Today's left thinks that America is just another country.
[02:02:03.131 --> 02:02:06.532]  Just one of the 190 some countries on the planet.
[02:02:06.532 --> 02:02:09.153]  United States of America is not just another country.
[02:02:09.153 --> 02:02:15.816]  It's the greatest nation in history that has done more good for more people than any country ever.
[02:02:15.816 --> 02:02:18.958]  A special place where people from all over the world
[02:02:20.078 --> 02:02:30.283]  All shapes, all sizes, all colors, all talents come to so they can chase down their goals, chase down their dreams, make life better for themselves and their family.
[02:02:30.283 --> 02:02:31.903]  That's this country.
[02:02:31.903 --> 02:02:40.227]  A special place where people come and respect the Constitution, cherish the Bill of Rights, and embrace the rule of law.
[02:02:40.227 --> 02:02:43.389]  Democrat Congressman Blumenauer said, abolish ICE.
[02:02:44.609 --> 02:02:50.672]  Secretary Clinton, when she was running for the highest office in the land, said we need a borderless hemisphere.
[02:02:50.672 --> 02:03:03.978]  We've learned from the WikiLeaks that you said this, and I want to quote, I will continue speaking out for comprehensive immigration reform.
[02:03:03.978 --> 02:03:07.979]  I think the people who are here deserve a path to citizenship.
[02:03:07.979 --> 02:03:08.920]  Speaker Pelosi,
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:10.961]  ...said walls are immoral.
[02:03:10.961 --> 02:03:12.902]  A wall is an immorality.
[02:03:12.902 --> 02:03:21.106]  Just last week, Stacey Abrams, governor candidate, state of Georgia, said non-citizens should be able to vote.
[02:03:21.106 --> 02:03:21.886]  Think about that.
[02:03:21.886 --> 02:03:25.288]  So in some cases you would be supportive of non-citizens voting?
[02:03:25.288 --> 02:03:26.769]  I wouldn't oppose it.
[02:03:26.769 --> 02:03:28.349]  She wouldn't oppose it.
[02:03:28.349 --> 02:03:33.312]  It sounds like she is open to non-citizens voting in local elections.
[02:03:33.592 --> 02:03:36.953]  Americans believe that borders need to be strong.
[02:03:36.953 --> 02:03:44.155]  Americans believe, we believe, that there's a difference, a big difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration.
[02:03:44.155 --> 02:03:53.318]  And Americans and Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus believe that a border security wall will help stop the drug problem, the gang problem, and the human trafficking problem.
[02:03:57.941 --> 02:04:00.162]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:00.162 --> 02:04:06.566]  And, you know, it's funny because people in America want to bitch and complain about stuff here, and there's a lot of corruption.
[02:04:06.566 --> 02:04:17.912]  I mean, we're the first to report it, but they tend to miss what America actually means, what it actually represents, and why it's the greatest country on earth.
[02:04:17.912 --> 02:04:24.496]  And then they tend to ignore, well, they don't ignore it when it's politically advantageous for them to bring it up, but they'll ignore the fact that
[02:04:25.404 --> 02:04:29.805]  Pretty much people from almost every country want to try to come to this country.
[02:04:29.805 --> 02:04:31.385]  Because it's the best on earth.
[02:04:31.385 --> 02:04:34.326]  If it was racist, it wouldn't be that way.
[02:04:34.326 --> 02:04:37.686]  But, you know, it's funny that they all complain about the status of America.
[02:04:37.686 --> 02:04:40.787]  You know, there used to be a way to measure rich and poor.
[02:04:40.787 --> 02:04:42.407]  You know what that way was?
[02:04:42.407 --> 02:04:46.168]  You would look at someone, and if they were fat, they'd be assumed rich.
[02:04:46.168 --> 02:04:48.048]  If they were skinny, they'd be assumed poor.
[02:04:48.048 --> 02:04:51.809]  You notice how many poor people in America are fat?
[02:04:51.809 --> 02:04:53.849]  What does that tell you about the standard of living in this country?
[02:04:56.039 --> 02:05:08.563]  CBD rich hemp oil is totally organic, all natural, something God gave us, and it doesn't have THC in it, and it's totally legal in all 50 states.
[02:05:08.563 --> 02:05:10.544]  This is where everybody's going.
[02:05:11.564 --> 02:05:14.747]  This is what your body actually needs.
[02:05:14.747 --> 02:05:25.735]  There are so many different spectrums of this natural oil that comes from him, now legal and lawful in all 50 states, that you need to just go research it for yourself.
[02:05:26.455 --> 02:05:27.736]  This is not marijuana.
[02:05:27.736 --> 02:05:29.438]  There are hundreds of varieties of hemp.
[02:05:29.438 --> 02:05:35.082]  This is industrial hemp that has all the good attributes, but not the bad attributes.
[02:05:35.082 --> 02:05:37.123]  People wonder why I haven't gotten to CBD oil?
[02:05:37.123 --> 02:05:42.648]  Well, because some of the stuff's got problems, some of it can get you high, and some of it can get you arrested.
[02:05:42.648 --> 02:05:43.909]  This is not that.
[02:05:43.909 --> 02:05:45.350]  Legal in all 50 states.
[02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:47.872]  It's from hemp, not marijuana.
[02:05:47.872 --> 02:05:49.373]  It's totally legal.
[02:05:49.373 --> 02:05:55.758]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we can ship to all 50 states right now from the great website, washingtonsreserve.com.
[02:05:57.233 --> 02:05:59.324]  We are drugged out!
[02:05:59.324 --> 02:06:01.596]  We are following other people's opinions!
[02:06:02.748 --> 02:06:05.529]  We are controlled by the media.
[02:06:05.529 --> 02:06:07.410]  Today, it all changes.
[02:06:07.410 --> 02:06:10.172]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[02:06:10.172 --> 02:06:13.233]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[02:06:13.233 --> 02:06:17.976]  Einstein says the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[02:06:17.976 --> 02:06:20.657]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[02:06:20.657 --> 02:06:23.478]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[02:06:23.478 --> 02:06:25.919]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:06:25.919 --> 02:06:27.560]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:28.841]  We have the resources.
[02:06:32.045 --> 02:06:35.567]  Sometimes you need some crazy motherf***** to change something.
[02:06:35.567 --> 02:06:38.710]  Steve Jobs is crazy, now we all on Steve Jobs phones.
[02:06:38.710 --> 02:06:40.871]  They say Trump's crazy, they say I'm crazy.
[02:06:40.871 --> 02:06:43.273]  But I'm here to show love.
[02:06:43.273 --> 02:06:48.417]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[02:06:48.417 --> 02:06:52.539]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:06:52.539 --> 02:06:54.321]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:07:02.087 --> 02:07:04.589]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas.
[02:07:04.589 --> 02:07:05.029]  The U.S.
[02:07:05.029 --> 02:07:13.754]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[02:07:13.754 --> 02:07:16.255]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[02:07:16.255 --> 02:07:18.056]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[02:07:18.056 --> 02:07:20.217]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[02:07:20.217 --> 02:07:22.559]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[02:07:22.559 --> 02:07:23.659]  This is all confirmed.
[02:07:23.659 --> 02:07:24.760]  This is not a drill.
[02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:28.702]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[02:07:29.002 --> 02:07:31.503]  They've officially become state-run.
[02:07:31.503 --> 02:07:31.884]  Apple 100%.
[02:07:31.884 --> 02:07:37.506]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[02:07:37.506 --> 02:07:42.589]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:43.470]  This is happening.
[02:07:43.470 --> 02:07:51.494]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[02:07:51.494 --> 02:07:57.417]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[02:07:57.817 --> 02:08:06.520]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:10.522]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[02:08:10.522 --> 02:08:14.023]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[02:08:14.023 --> 02:08:21.266]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[02:08:21.266 --> 02:08:24.267]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[02:08:24.267 --> 02:08:27.568]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score,
[02:08:27.848 --> 02:08:28.649]  We're good to go.
[02:08:51.798 --> 02:09:00.545]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[02:09:00.545 --> 02:09:05.809]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[02:09:05.809 --> 02:09:09.151]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[02:09:09.151 --> 02:09:10.933]  And so they make me a murderer of children.
[02:09:10.933 --> 02:09:18.719]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[02:09:19.239 --> 02:09:26.426]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[02:09:26.426 --> 02:09:32.011]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used against you.
[02:09:32.011 --> 02:09:36.616]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[02:09:36.616 --> 02:09:38.958]  I have given you the transmission!
[02:09:38.958 --> 02:09:39.879]  Now break free!
[02:09:43.599 --> 02:09:52.742]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:09:52.742 --> 02:09:55.683]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:09:55.683 --> 02:10:03.546]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:10:03.546 --> 02:10:06.187]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:10:06.187 --> 02:10:11.309]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:10:16.835 --> 02:10:21.460]  My wife was scheduled for surgery today, for the last month.
[02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:25.805]  And so I wasn't going to be here.
[02:10:25.805 --> 02:10:32.232]  But I ended up staying up basically all last night because of the information you're about to receive.
[02:10:32.232 --> 02:10:35.876]  And I got her into surgery, got her out, and I'm here.
[02:10:35.876 --> 02:10:37.838]  I want to thank the crew.
[02:10:37.838 --> 02:10:38.739]  I want to thank everybody.
[02:10:39.857 --> 02:10:42.419]  Who makes this broadcast possible?
[02:10:42.419 --> 02:10:49.964]  Now, I'm going to try to be very reserved and very calm in the rest of the hour with Roger Stone.
[02:10:49.964 --> 02:10:52.286]  And I'm going to try to lay this information out.
[02:10:52.286 --> 02:10:54.747]  I want to explain something to everybody.
[02:10:54.747 --> 02:11:02.092]  We've now moved on from the two-year fake Russia hoax, the witch hunt.
[02:11:02.092 --> 02:11:03.213]  We've now moved on
[02:11:07.133 --> 02:11:19.563]  To the final phase of the witch hunt, where it goes into an inquisition and they start persecuting everybody and overturning the 2016 election.
[02:11:19.563 --> 02:11:31.113]  And that means putting Nancy Pelosi in, because by saying it's a foreign meddling, by saying it's a foreign attack, by doing this, they are then able to remove the vice president as well.
[02:11:32.378 --> 02:11:43.348]  And then you will have her as the president and whoever she wants to designate as vice president.
[02:11:43.348 --> 02:11:45.991]  So that's why this is so incredibly important.
[02:11:45.991 --> 02:11:47.612]  This is a lot bigger than InfoWars.
[02:11:47.612 --> 02:11:53.078]  It's a lot bigger than any individual person like Roger Stone.
[02:11:53.078 --> 02:11:57.302]  This is the culmination, the coming to a head of Robert Mueller's investigation.
[02:11:58.297 --> 02:12:01.219]  And the word is they're going to move on him in March.
[02:12:01.219 --> 02:12:06.162]  I got that from a lot of really intelligent, high-level sources last October.
[02:12:06.162 --> 02:12:10.285]  And I said they're going to move against him again in March.
[02:12:10.285 --> 02:12:13.307]  And you can see it all building to a crescendo.
[02:12:13.307 --> 02:12:17.750]  Now let me make the personal announcement, then we'll flush it all out, go through it all.
[02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:19.952]  Here on air, I have the documents.
[02:12:19.952 --> 02:12:25.075]  This is going to be world-exclusive information here for everybody.
[02:12:25.075 --> 02:12:26.917]  I've gone to the FBI last year.
[02:12:27.842 --> 02:12:34.006]  When obviously another arm of it, the Mueller operation, tried to set me up that there's just cut and dry right out of a movie.
[02:12:34.006 --> 02:12:37.208]  You wouldn't believe it.
[02:12:37.208 --> 02:12:53.659]  Then again, we were basically infiltrated and we've been able from high-level sources and by using police tactics to get major news organizations to admit who their sources are.
[02:12:55.180 --> 02:12:57.561]  And so we know exactly who is behind it.
[02:12:57.561 --> 02:12:58.861]  We're able to cross-reference it.
[02:12:58.861 --> 02:13:15.766]  So, because we've been this persecuted and this targeted and set up as the straw men for the entire fall of America, and the takedown of the President, and our Republic itself, literally, we are in the eye of the hurricane and are able to see things and know things others don't.
[02:13:15.766 --> 02:13:18.407]  That's why this is actually a blessing.
[02:13:18.407 --> 02:13:20.468]  In fact, I'm not scared of Robert Mueller III.
[02:13:20.468 --> 02:13:24.449]  I'm not scared of all these white shoe boy lawyers and wannabe tough guys, okay?
[02:13:25.569 --> 02:13:28.050]  Uh, who cover up all the pedophilia and evil and the rest of it.
[02:13:28.050 --> 02:13:32.551]  I, I know I've been put in this place by God.
[02:13:32.551 --> 02:13:36.712]  Thanks for your support and prayers to now face this test.
[02:13:36.712 --> 02:13:41.134]  In fact, my entire life, I have just been feeling like I'm not carrying out my mission and I've got to do something.
[02:13:41.134 --> 02:13:44.595]  And I'm always burning in my bones and driven.
[02:13:44.595 --> 02:13:46.715]  And there's just been this great weight on me.
[02:13:46.715 --> 02:13:48.356]  And for the first time in my life, it's lifted.
[02:13:50.251 --> 02:13:57.273]  It's, it's, it's, it's, I mean I really feel the spirit of God's with me and I just am right where I want to be.
[02:13:57.273 --> 02:14:00.474]  But I want to tell you all something ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:00.474 --> 02:14:09.757]  This spirit of fear and this spirit of bullying from the left and the deep state and the rogue state and the globalist is permeating this country.
[02:14:09.757 --> 02:14:12.358]  And we have a real shortage of men.
[02:14:12.358 --> 02:14:19.160]  I've been on the phone today with some of the most prominent and famous people in the country who are the few people that have courage to talk about this and
[02:14:20.683 --> 02:14:24.145]  They have said without me even saying it, I'm not worried about myself.
[02:14:24.145 --> 02:14:26.307]  In fact, I have no fear.
[02:14:26.307 --> 02:14:29.309]  I fear for our children and the country and the world.
[02:14:29.309 --> 02:14:31.290]  And that's what you've got to step into as a man.
[02:14:31.290 --> 02:14:34.192]  Before we get to this information, we'll come back from break and get into it.
[02:14:34.192 --> 02:14:36.833]  Folks need to understand something.
[02:14:36.833 --> 02:14:38.895]  They are systematically, consciously,
[02:14:40.137 --> 02:14:43.739]  Trying to create frauds, like Trump in a hotel being pissed on.
[02:14:43.739 --> 02:14:46.061]  BuzzFeed puts it out, it's admittedly fake.
[02:14:46.061 --> 02:14:49.823]  Now today they have Cohen the stool pigeon, who's very low IQ.
[02:14:49.823 --> 02:14:56.467]  A known liar saying Trump told him to send a bag of cash and a boxing glove to somebody.
[02:14:56.467 --> 02:14:57.428]  To rig a poll.
[02:14:57.428 --> 02:14:59.569]  See, oh, Trump rigged the election.
[02:14:59.569 --> 02:15:03.892]  Trump rigged, not Hillary, with her admitted fake polls and the WikiLeaks.
[02:15:05.362 --> 02:15:11.745]  Not John Podesta two years before the election even started saying buy off all the pollsters so none of them will report the truth in 2016.
[02:15:11.745 --> 02:15:15.807]  That's two years before the election even gets going.
[02:15:15.807 --> 02:15:27.033]  They're already buying everyone off with polls to let them know who their big mama is and which side of the bread everything's buttered.
[02:15:27.033 --> 02:15:33.776]  So they're making their move and literally trying to indict not just me, but my father,
[02:15:35.652 --> 02:15:38.034]  And Roger Stone.
[02:15:38.034 --> 02:15:45.818]  And it's sickening to hear these ABC and Washington Post reporters giggling and snickering about their criminal activity.
[02:15:45.818 --> 02:15:54.063]  I mean, this is a group of criminals, and we will defeat these terrorists, these psychological terrorists, who get the global exclusive on how they plan to take Trump out straight ahead.
[02:15:55.111 --> 02:15:58.972]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[02:16:26.261 --> 02:16:30.183]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.183 --> 02:16:31.724]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:31.724 --> 02:16:34.685]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.

[02:18:00.543 --> 02:18:04.006]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:18:04.006 --> 02:18:05.788]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:18:05.788 --> 02:18:09.050]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:18:09.050 --> 02:18:15.836]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:18:15.836 --> 02:18:20.920]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[02:18:21.260 --> 02:18:27.361]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:18:27.361 --> 02:18:30.342]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:18:30.342 --> 02:18:31.422]  I want to keep going.
[02:18:31.422 --> 02:18:35.263]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:18:35.263 --> 02:18:37.284]  I want to push all the way.
[02:18:37.284 --> 02:18:38.564]  I've committed to do that.
[02:18:38.564 --> 02:18:39.644]  I've prayed for that.
[02:18:39.644 --> 02:18:41.284]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:18:41.284 --> 02:18:43.725]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.

[02:20:38.178 --> 02:20:41.040]  Roger Stone joins us with a global exclusive.
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:43.321]  This is not Russiagate we're talking about.
[02:20:43.321 --> 02:20:50.404]  That is the vehicle to overturn the 2016 election and seat Nancy Pelosi as President of the United States.
[02:20:50.404 --> 02:20:52.145]  That is their admitted plan.
[02:20:52.145 --> 02:20:53.746]  They've introduced the impeachment.
[02:20:53.746 --> 02:20:57.187]  It's on the cover of establishment publications.
[02:20:57.187 --> 02:20:57.988]  They're making their move.
[02:20:59.147 --> 02:21:07.973]  You see the propaganda that Trump's a liar, and that he's a criminal, and that he is a horrible person, and he needs to be removed everywhere.
[02:21:07.973 --> 02:21:10.895]  You see them plunging the economy and other economies.
[02:21:10.895 --> 02:21:13.356]  The globalists are saying they're going to punish us.
[02:21:13.356 --> 02:21:23.283]  The two exclusive articles are on Infowars.com and Newswars.com by Paul Joseph Watson, working with myself and Roger Stone today.
[02:21:24.713 --> 02:21:30.919]  And I'm asking listeners, for your own family, for your own sake, this isn't just one more story out there.
[02:21:30.919 --> 02:21:38.247]  Both of these articles on Infowars.com, you'll get more viral spread at Newswars.com, they don't block that as much, are critical.
[02:21:39.974 --> 02:21:42.776]  They must be sent to every police department, every state police department.
[02:21:42.776 --> 02:21:45.218]  You should flood the FBI email with this.
[02:21:45.218 --> 02:21:47.159]  Because most of those people there aren't bad.
[02:21:47.159 --> 02:21:47.720]  It's at the top.
[02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:49.381]  You should flood talk radio.
[02:21:49.381 --> 02:21:50.762]  Flood everything.
[02:21:50.762 --> 02:21:53.704]  Right now the phones are ringing off the hook in there.
[02:21:53.704 --> 02:21:58.408]  Because they've had, the Washington Post is run by the leftist CIA.
[02:21:58.408 --> 02:22:00.289]  That's been declassified.
[02:22:00.289 --> 02:22:05.794]  And the New York Times is also operating, and ABC News.
[02:22:06.972 --> 02:22:14.960]  And they began calling in the last week, bringing up the attempted sting that Mueller tried on us, clearly.
[02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:21.446]  And I have the documents and they're coming out.
[02:22:21.446 --> 02:22:31.276]  And then bringing up new false claims that we made, that Roger Stone, myself, my dad, my poor sweet dad, such a patriot.
[02:22:32.785 --> 02:22:39.609]  Made payments to Jerome Corsi to cover up WikiLeaks information and where that came from.
[02:22:39.609 --> 02:22:42.630]  Absolutely total fiction.
[02:22:42.630 --> 02:22:45.191]  As fictional as Star Wars.
[02:22:45.191 --> 02:22:46.812]  Or the Koran.
[02:22:46.812 --> 02:22:49.794]  And so, that's where we now are.
[02:22:49.794 --> 02:22:57.478]  And we know they did that believing that they would get us to release the stories because we don't have any other choice.
[02:22:59.451 --> 02:23:02.652]  Because this information is so out of control.
[02:23:02.652 --> 02:23:06.693]  So I just want the enemy to know, we know what you're doing.
[02:23:06.693 --> 02:23:11.515]  You know, first get us to try to not report on it, and not talk about how you're trying to set us up.
[02:23:11.515 --> 02:23:16.636]  Then pull back, create a whole new lie that we'll lay out in great detail right now.
[02:23:16.636 --> 02:23:26.840]  But understand this, when we're done doing that, they're making their move, we'll go a little bit to the next hour, they're making their move on Trump in the next few months.
[02:23:26.840 --> 02:23:27.880]  And we exclusively,
[02:23:29.181 --> 02:23:37.228]  From our unparalleled perspective, in the middle of the battle, have intel that no one else has.
[02:23:37.228 --> 02:23:40.451]  So the answer to defeating this whole thing is in our hands.
[02:23:40.451 --> 02:23:44.034]  And I have to tell the President something.
[02:23:44.034 --> 02:23:46.917]  And I'll do this at the end of this discussion.
[02:23:46.917 --> 02:23:52.382]  First we'll talk about what's currently happening in the next level of the Inquisition, the political coup by the Deep State.
[02:23:53.789 --> 02:23:54.170]  We're good to go.
[02:24:09.744 --> 02:24:14.388]  That then it's not that he's our enemy, but that something's wrong with him.
[02:24:14.388 --> 02:24:15.449]  He's autistic.
[02:24:15.449 --> 02:24:18.192]  He's very smart in some ways, not in others.
[02:24:18.192 --> 02:24:21.475]  And that he means well, but he's not defending us.
[02:24:21.475 --> 02:24:22.876]  He's not defending himself.
[02:24:22.876 --> 02:24:27.461]  And we'll go on with nationalism and anti-globalism and fight the left, but Trump must be abandoned.
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:32.382]  Because if Trump is abandoning the people defending him, then he must be abandoned.
[02:24:32.382 --> 02:24:35.924]  So I'm letting the President know, not to get Mueller off my ass, I'll fight him to the end.
[02:24:35.924 --> 02:24:38.006]  He's a globalist that sold the country out.
[02:24:38.006 --> 02:24:48.832]  But if Trump doesn't understand the existential threat to him, his family, the country, everything, and doesn't move against these people when they're open criminals, in an open criminal conspiracy, and lets them do this, then...
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:52.222]  These little stunts canceling Pelosi's airplane ride.
[02:24:52.222 --> 02:24:53.642]  Okay, that's all cutesy foot.
[02:24:53.642 --> 02:24:54.523]  That's not real world.
[02:24:54.523 --> 02:24:55.484]  Roger, I'm going to shut up now.
[02:24:55.484 --> 02:24:56.524]  This segment next.
[02:24:56.524 --> 02:24:57.185]  Give you the floor.
[02:24:57.185 --> 02:24:58.246]  You're on fire.
[02:24:58.246 --> 02:25:04.890]  We've been up all night long just going over everything, making sure everything is absolutely accurate.
[02:25:04.890 --> 02:25:11.935]  And now I know the next move, Mueller's specialty, Mueller's specialty, targeting people's families.
[02:25:12.455 --> 02:25:15.075]  But you know, my mom normally doesn't like conflict.
[02:25:15.075 --> 02:25:16.736]  Last night, I'm talking to her at 3 a.m.
[02:25:16.736 --> 02:25:17.996]  She goes, God's on our side.
[02:25:17.996 --> 02:25:19.036]  I'm not worried at all.
[02:25:19.036 --> 02:25:20.256]  It's all going to turn out good.
[02:25:20.256 --> 02:25:22.257]  We come from good people.
[02:25:22.257 --> 02:25:23.417]  We come from good people.
[02:25:23.417 --> 02:25:24.637]  We're good people.
[02:25:24.637 --> 02:25:25.557]  We founded America.
[02:25:25.557 --> 02:25:26.757]  We founded Texas.
[02:25:26.757 --> 02:25:27.798]  We won the wars.
[02:25:27.798 --> 02:25:30.098]  And you parasites come in and take it over later.
[02:25:30.098 --> 02:25:31.918]  So, Roger, you've got the floor of this segment.
[02:25:31.918 --> 02:25:32.979]  What's left is the next one.
[02:25:32.979 --> 02:25:41.020]  Get into the current conspiracy to finally gin up some fake Russia connection to overturn the election using you, myself, and my father.
[02:25:42.250 --> 02:25:46.751]  Yeah, I think, Alex, important people understand that this is a sub-plot.
[02:25:46.751 --> 02:26:01.415]  In other words, the Deep Staters understand that as a precursor to take down Donald Trump, which they clearly intend to do, they need to co-opt and silence both Roger Stone and Alex Jones and, of course, InfoWars.
[02:26:02.055 --> 02:26:26.612]  And therefore, as I have told the InfoWars audience previously, I've been deeply disappointed that Dr. Jerry Corsi, who at least on paper is a patriot, has been more than willing to bear false witness against me for Robert Mueller and the grand jury, claiming falsely that the information he provided to me regarding the Podesta Brothers' Russian dealings was somehow a cover story.
[02:26:27.192 --> 02:26:32.556]  A cover story for what is not clear, because no cover story is required.
[02:26:32.556 --> 02:26:41.542]  Now, incredibly, Corsi is clearly told the special counsel, Mr. Mueller, most likely the grand jury... Well, let's just say it.
[02:26:41.542 --> 02:26:42.063]  We know.
[02:26:42.063 --> 02:26:43.083]  We were able to confirm.
[02:26:43.083 --> 02:26:46.766]  So, you need to know his cover's blown, but yeah, continue.
[02:26:47.601 --> 02:27:01.229]  But he's evidently claiming, falsely, that his employment at Infowars, where he was briefly the Washington Bureau Chief, was somehow a hush money or an inducement for him to be silent.
[02:27:01.229 --> 02:27:04.691]  This is completely and totally categorically false.
[02:27:05.391 --> 02:27:16.156]  As is his claim that I knew about the Billy Bush tape in advance, as is all of his prognostications regarding WikiLeaks, every one of which turned out to be false.
[02:27:16.156 --> 02:27:24.760]  So now he is claiming that evidently some severance he got from InfoWars after being terminated
[02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:28.081]  After a drunken meltdown in a Washington D.C.
[02:27:28.081 --> 02:27:32.343]  restaurant constituted hush money payments.
[02:27:32.343 --> 02:27:36.504]  It's ludicrous, it's ridiculous, and it's false.
[02:27:36.504 --> 02:27:40.126]  No one gets paid at Infowars for work they didn't do.
[02:27:40.126 --> 02:27:45.508]  So under his contract, I'm told by your folks, that he received some limited severance.
[02:27:45.928 --> 02:27:49.869]  But now he's mischaracterizing that as a hush money payment.
[02:27:49.869 --> 02:27:51.229]  Hush money for what?
[02:27:51.229 --> 02:27:52.989]  No hush money is required.
[02:27:52.989 --> 02:27:55.670]  Nobody at Infowars has done anything wrong.
[02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:57.230]  I have done nothing wrong.
[02:27:57.230 --> 02:28:12.753]  But anybody who doesn't understand that Jerry Corsi and his inept lawyer Larry Klayman are now playing ball with Robert Mueller and the Washington Post that is trying to promulgate this pack of lies does not understand what's going on.
[02:28:12.753 --> 02:28:14.913]  But they just heard the stone cold truth.
[02:28:15.413 --> 02:28:19.896]  That's right, and it's lightweight for the Washington Post and ABC to know.
[02:28:19.896 --> 02:28:22.538]  We know you guys aren't off the record, and neither are we, okay?
[02:28:22.538 --> 02:28:24.960]  So we've got your ass.
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:25.881]  And it's all being...
[02:28:27.122 --> 02:28:29.623]  Transmitted to the proper authorities, though there's not many of them left.
[02:28:29.623 --> 02:28:33.145]  Most men have, like, gone, oh gosh, the deep state's moving on Trump.
[02:28:33.145 --> 02:28:34.266]  Let me roll over.
[02:28:34.266 --> 02:28:39.528]  Yeah, for the chi-coms and the radical Islamicists and how the pedophiles are going to get your kids in the schools.
[02:28:39.528 --> 02:28:45.071]  If anybody rolls over to this, you might as well just sign your warrant to go to hell when you die, I'm here to tell you.
[02:28:45.071 --> 02:28:52.615]  When we come back, we're going to lay it all out and where this rabbit hole leads, it leads to the plan to remove Trump and install not just Pelosi,
[02:28:55.157 --> 02:28:56.358]  Bacon Lovers.

[02:30:01.288 --> 02:30:02.950]  There is no un-continuum.
[02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:06.172]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[02:30:06.172 --> 02:30:09.535]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:30:09.535 --> 02:30:10.776]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[02:30:10.776 --> 02:30:11.576]  We'll be here forever.
[02:30:11.576 --> 02:30:12.817]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:30:12.817 --> 02:30:19.703]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[02:30:19.703 --> 02:30:20.283]  We made it.
[02:30:20.283 --> 02:30:22.445]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:30:22.445 --> 02:30:24.247]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[02:30:24.247 --> 02:30:24.627]  And so,
[02:30:24.827 --> 02:30:31.292]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[02:30:31.292 --> 02:30:36.335]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[02:30:36.335 --> 02:30:39.197]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:30:39.197 --> 02:30:41.619]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[02:30:41.619 --> 02:30:45.101]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[02:30:45.101 --> 02:30:46.382]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:30:46.382 --> 02:30:50.665]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[02:30:50.665 --> 02:30:53.547]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[02:30:53.547 --> 02:30:54.348]  I want life.
[02:30:54.628 --> 02:30:55.848]  I want Jesus!
[02:30:55.848 --> 02:30:59.970]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.

[02:32:20.487 --> 02:32:29.855]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[02:32:30.535 --> 02:32:34.477]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[02:32:34.477 --> 02:32:40.441]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[02:32:40.441 --> 02:32:43.462]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[02:32:43.462 --> 02:32:44.983]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:32:44.983 --> 02:32:48.185]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[02:32:48.185 --> 02:32:54.589]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[02:32:59.059 --> 02:33:18.311]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.311 --> 02:33:24.836]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:34.645 --> 02:33:40.210]  You know, I don't fight Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi and the globalists and their minions like Robert Mueller and their bag men.
[02:33:40.210 --> 02:33:43.332]  Because I hate them.
[02:33:43.332 --> 02:33:45.554]  Or because I want their swamp.
[02:33:45.554 --> 02:33:47.636]  I want to be away from them.
[02:33:47.636 --> 02:33:51.379]  And I don't want them running our schools and our local communities.
[02:33:51.379 --> 02:33:52.680]  See, I'm in Texas.
[02:33:54.645 --> 02:33:56.907]  I don't hang around in your little trendy cool areas.
[02:33:56.907 --> 02:33:59.028]  Nothing against anybody that lives in New York or whatever.
[02:33:59.028 --> 02:34:14.860]  The point is, is that the establishment there are all nothing but materialistic, narcissistic, self-aggrandizing worshippers who have crawled their way up the ass of the devil and think they're winners.
[02:34:15.828 --> 02:34:17.349]  I'm a trailblazer.
[02:34:17.349 --> 02:34:18.831]  I'm a pioneer.
[02:34:18.831 --> 02:34:20.212]  I'm a builder.
[02:34:20.212 --> 02:34:22.174]  And it doesn't mean I'm on a power trip.
[02:34:22.174 --> 02:34:25.236]  It means I love God and I love justice.
[02:34:25.236 --> 02:34:28.820]  And I knew Roger Stone wasn't involved with the Russians.
[02:34:28.820 --> 02:34:31.582]  I knew WikiLeaks didn't come from the Russians.
[02:34:31.582 --> 02:34:39.289]  Hell, I've had the former head of the NSA in my office and in the studio, and they have on record the download speeds of the WikiLeaks.
[02:34:39.289 --> 02:34:42.332]  It was downloaded in the port by a thumb drive.
[02:34:43.208 --> 02:34:47.512]  At that time, it was like five times faster than the fastest online download.
[02:34:47.512 --> 02:34:49.334]  We know what went on.
[02:34:49.334 --> 02:34:52.617]  We know they were scared to death of anybody looking at Seth Rich.
[02:34:52.617 --> 02:35:00.444]  And I was here when Still and WikiLeaks was all over the news, and they wouldn't give us the time of day, and I was calling him Hillary Clinton's butt plug.
[02:35:00.444 --> 02:35:05.188]  I was here when we were trying to get the big scoop.
[02:35:05.188 --> 02:35:06.710]  What's wrong with journalists trying to get the big scoop?
[02:35:08.206 --> 02:35:11.328]  You saw Gucifer 2.0 talk in the New York Times?
[02:35:11.328 --> 02:35:14.951]  Roger couldn't even tweet at him and say, hey, give me some info.
[02:35:14.951 --> 02:35:22.597]  So, we all know this is a fraud, like Pissgate, everything else, and we have a memory.
[02:35:22.597 --> 02:35:29.002]  But now, I know for 100%, not 99.999, 100 platinum percent it's pure crap.
[02:35:37.682 --> 02:35:40.983]  My father managed, at one time, 100 dental offices.
[02:35:40.983 --> 02:35:42.304]  By the end, about 30.
[02:35:42.304 --> 02:35:43.865]  He was working 15 hours a day.
[02:35:43.865 --> 02:35:45.785]  He'd come home and collapse.
[02:35:45.785 --> 02:35:46.706]  And he had heart problems.
[02:35:46.706 --> 02:35:51.128]  I didn't even tell my mom about it because he wanted to keep her... He treats her like royalty.
[02:35:51.128 --> 02:35:52.188]  That's how we do in our family.
[02:35:52.188 --> 02:35:54.549]  Spoil the hell out of the women.
[02:35:54.549 --> 02:35:59.711]  And I hired him seven years ago because he could be trusted to do accounting and HR.
[02:35:59.711 --> 02:36:02.112]  And that's all he does.
[02:36:02.112 --> 02:36:04.614]  And if anything, he's too nice to everybody.
[02:36:04.614 --> 02:36:05.274]  He's a sweetheart.
[02:36:06.542 --> 02:36:10.163]  And you know, it's next level to go after my dad.
[02:36:10.163 --> 02:36:15.704]  It's next level to know that my dad said that, of course, he cried on the phone.
[02:36:15.704 --> 02:36:17.024]  So I kept saying, I'm firing him.
[02:36:17.024 --> 02:36:17.684]  We got all the emails.
[02:36:17.684 --> 02:36:19.365]  I'm firing him in April for this story.
[02:36:19.365 --> 02:36:20.785]  This is a load of crap.
[02:36:20.785 --> 02:36:22.745]  And I go, oh, we'll see if it gets better or whatever.
[02:36:22.745 --> 02:36:24.846]  And he goes, oh, he's our bureau chief.
[02:36:24.846 --> 02:36:25.906]  Big name we had.
[02:36:25.906 --> 02:36:28.646]  He didn't deliver any of it.
[02:36:28.646 --> 02:36:30.847]  And then, and I'm telling Roger, I'm going to fire this guy.
[02:36:30.847 --> 02:36:32.487]  He's a frickin' kook, man.
[02:36:32.487 --> 02:36:34.228]  He used to be great on Lou Dobbs and everything.
[02:36:34.228 --> 02:36:35.088]  What the hell happened to him?
[02:36:37.295 --> 02:36:44.480]  I'm gonna go back to Roger here, just so you get, just so you understand this, this is the truth.
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:49.343]  He brings this Colonel Sanders guy here, he tells me, oh Peter Thiel wants to invest in you.
[02:36:49.343 --> 02:36:51.584]  Wasn't the Russians, it was Peter Thiel supposedly.
[02:36:51.584 --> 02:36:59.269]  And when they show up, it's not Peter Thiel, it's Colonel Sanders!
[02:36:59.269 --> 02:37:06.374]  And the other guy, I'll remember his name in a minute, and I call Roger up, he's only ever giving me straight info, and he goes, yeah, it's a bunch of talk.
[02:37:07.389 --> 02:37:10.831]  And so I sit there and I hear that, and see, so Corsi got pissed.
[02:37:10.831 --> 02:37:15.034]  Corsi's like, we're gonna have a private offering and we're gonna impose worldwide all this BS.
[02:37:15.034 --> 02:37:17.556]  I was like, dude, I'm not involved in any of that.
[02:37:17.556 --> 02:37:20.538]  And I was like, my alarms are going off.
[02:37:20.538 --> 02:37:31.385]  And so within Corsi being here six, seven, eight months already, my opinion of him went way down from all the 18 years I'd known him and the great work he'd done and the best-selling books and everything he'd been engaged in.
[02:37:31.385 --> 02:37:36.148]  And this is just the anatomy of what's happening here.
[02:37:38.899 --> 02:37:43.201]  We've got to get back into currently and how they're going after Trump and this big global exclusive.
[02:37:43.201 --> 02:38:04.872]  It's just the idea then to be sitting here and to know what really went on and then to have the Washington Post and all these other publications sitting there saying, we hear you paid Corsi hush money because his contract was year-to-year and if it wasn't for cause then we said we'd pay out his contracts.
[02:38:04.872 --> 02:38:06.133]  He was let go in June.
[02:38:06.133 --> 02:38:07.814]  We said fine because he was crying.
[02:38:09.039 --> 02:38:09.479]  Begging.
[02:38:39.919 --> 02:38:45.222]  Roger Stone was one of the dozens of people that said, hire Jack Posobiec, hire Corsi.
[02:38:45.222 --> 02:38:46.723]  We're trying to build something.
[02:38:46.723 --> 02:38:54.647]  Corsi had been let go at WorldNetDaily, was trying to get a job here before Roger ever said, okay, hire Corsi, because Corsi called him and said, please get me hired.
[02:38:54.647 --> 02:38:55.708]  And so what I get now...
[02:38:57.173 --> 02:39:03.376]  For hiring Corsi and not letting him and Colonel Sanders take over InfoWars is, you think you'll get to me?
[02:39:03.376 --> 02:39:07.659]  You can hang my dad up by his toes and slit his goddamn throat.
[02:39:07.659 --> 02:39:09.399]  I won't sell this country or my kids out.
[02:39:09.399 --> 02:39:11.200]  And my dad's ready, by the way.
[02:39:11.200 --> 02:39:13.742]  So, he may be a sweet person, but he's not gonna roll over.
[02:39:13.742 --> 02:39:17.144]  You think, Mueller, because you're targeting my daddy, my kids, anything!
[02:39:17.144 --> 02:39:17.444]  Listen!
[02:39:18.084 --> 02:39:22.646]  I don't back down to pedophile supporters like you, Mueller, you piece of filth!
[02:39:22.646 --> 02:39:36.713]  So no matter what you do, you criminal, jihadi-supporting, 9-11-covering-up maggot, and Hillary, your whore controller, I will never roll over to you, you sons of bitches, so get that through your head.
[02:39:39.273 --> 02:39:42.334]  You think I'm a cowardly piece of crap like you?
[02:39:42.334 --> 02:39:45.556]  You think I'd sell out my soul for anything?
[02:39:45.556 --> 02:39:46.256]  Nothing.
[02:39:46.256 --> 02:39:47.257]  It's not for sale.
[02:39:47.257 --> 02:39:48.817]  There's no price.
[02:39:48.817 --> 02:39:50.398]  Because I've seen hell.
[02:39:50.398 --> 02:39:51.138]  So I'm gonna say it again.
[02:39:51.138 --> 02:39:52.379]  I go back to Roger and I'm sorry.
[02:39:52.379 --> 02:39:55.820]  We'll get into their plan to take down Trump and come back and all the rest of it.
[02:39:55.820 --> 02:39:58.582]  It's just so diabolical.
[02:39:58.582 --> 02:40:08.226]  When you sit there and you're a good, wholesome person and these people manufacture this crap and they've tried to shut us down and curtail us so that when they made this move,
[02:40:08.846 --> 02:40:11.427]  We would not even have a voice, but you know what?
[02:40:11.427 --> 02:40:14.869]  I believe in our listeners and viewers, and I believe this voice will get out.
[02:40:14.869 --> 02:40:21.152]  I believe no matter what happens to me, just like Colonel Travis at the Alamo, and I'm not comparing myself to that yet, but I'm cut from that.
[02:40:21.152 --> 02:40:23.453]  You better believe it like nobody else you know!
[02:40:24.273 --> 02:40:25.734]  Nobody else you knows.
[02:40:25.734 --> 02:40:28.375]  That connected like I am and I don't brag about it.
[02:40:28.375 --> 02:40:31.376]  I will never back down to goddamn pieces of filth.
[02:40:31.376 --> 02:40:33.017]  And I mean that not in the Lord's name in vain.
[02:40:33.017 --> 02:40:34.578]  I mean you people are damned to hell.
[02:40:34.578 --> 02:40:35.838]  Roger, we got three minutes to break.
[02:40:35.838 --> 02:40:36.759]  We'll have the whole next segment.
[02:40:36.759 --> 02:40:38.900]  Then we got to get into, we'll back up baggage.
[02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:39.940]  We got to go to the next hour.
[02:40:39.940 --> 02:40:42.081]  They're planning to take out Trump, put in Pelosi.
[02:40:42.081 --> 02:40:43.182]  They admit it now.
[02:40:43.182 --> 02:40:43.802]  It's on.
[02:40:43.802 --> 02:40:44.763]  Trump won't listen.
[02:40:44.763 --> 02:40:45.783]  I've got to let Trump know.
[02:40:45.783 --> 02:40:46.403]  Just go ahead.
[02:40:46.403 --> 02:40:46.744]  I'm sorry.
[02:40:46.744 --> 02:40:47.624]  I've got you here and I'm ranting.
[02:40:49.130 --> 02:40:50.272]  Not at all, Alex.
[02:40:50.272 --> 02:40:52.535]  Look, this is definitively clear.
[02:40:52.535 --> 02:40:59.885]  Unfortunately, in violation of the Bible, Jerry Corsi has decided to bear false witness against both you and me.
[02:40:59.885 --> 02:41:05.512]  Unfortunately, his own text messages and the metadata tags on the various documents prove that he's lying.
[02:41:05.512 --> 02:41:06.774]  I guess he forgot about that.
[02:41:07.214 --> 02:41:17.686]  But he was perfectly willing to throw a fellow Trump supporter, a fellow conservative, over the side until they told him that he would have to plead guilty to something that he didn't do.
[02:41:17.686 --> 02:41:19.168]  Let's be very clear.
[02:41:19.168 --> 02:41:22.732]  He never told me that anybody had stolen John Podesta's emails.
[02:41:23.312 --> 02:41:25.534]  He never gave me any such thing.
[02:41:25.534 --> 02:41:27.776]  Therefore, there is nothing to cover up.
[02:41:27.776 --> 02:41:32.040]  In fact, my famous tweet was not controversial for six weeks.
[02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:34.962]  So cover up for what?
[02:41:34.962 --> 02:41:38.826]  His position is irrational as well as illogical.
[02:41:38.826 --> 02:41:46.853]  And then teaming with Shelby Holliday of the Wall Street Journal, one of the most duplicitous, dishonest, two-faced liars in media today,
[02:41:47.413 --> 02:41:55.685]  Teaming up with leftists like that, going on with Ari Melber of MSNBC to spew his lie after lie after lie.
[02:41:55.685 --> 02:41:58.589]  I don't know how Dr. Corsi sleeps with himself.
[02:41:58.589 --> 02:42:00.732]  Did they see what happened to Michael Cohen?
[02:42:00.732 --> 02:42:04.036]  What groveling and giving a rim job to Robert Mueller does?
[02:42:05.475 --> 02:42:17.977]  Yeah, look, if they think that there's any chance whatsoever that they're going to destroy you and they're going to get me to testify against Donald Trump, making up stories, bearing false witness, that's not going to happen.
[02:42:17.977 --> 02:42:20.178]  There's zero chance that's going to happen.
[02:42:20.178 --> 02:42:25.879]  The worst they do stuff to me, I mean, I would never have sold out before, but there's no, I mean, never.
[02:42:25.879 --> 02:42:27.539]  I mean, these people are the enemy.
[02:42:27.539 --> 02:42:28.219]  Hold on.
[02:42:28.219 --> 02:42:28.880]  We got to get it.
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:30.780]  I know you're going over you, but the point is.
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:41.705]  They are literally trying to say giving someone six months severance pay is a payoff and that they all want to indict, and they let me know, my father.
[02:42:41.705 --> 02:42:44.186]  And then we've got all other proof of the sting they tried to run.
[02:42:44.186 --> 02:42:46.828]  We haven't even gotten to that so bombshell is breaking as we speak.
[02:42:46.828 --> 02:42:52.751]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone about their master plan if they take Trump down in the next three months and how we can stop it.
[02:42:55.157 --> 02:43:03.561]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.561 --> 02:43:05.002]  Believe me, I know.
[02:43:05.002 --> 02:43:09.724]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:09.724 --> 02:43:12.786]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:43:13.266 --> 02:43:14.948]  I still have that energy.
[02:43:14.948 --> 02:43:35.104]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:43:35.604 --> 02:43:39.586]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[02:43:54.946 --> 02:44:04.233]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:44:04.233 --> 02:44:07.095]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:44:07.095 --> 02:44:13.160]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:44:13.820 --> 02:44:20.086]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:44:20.086 --> 02:44:26.351]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:44:26.351 --> 02:44:33.317]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:44:34.438 --> 02:44:47.464]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:44:47.464 --> 02:44:51.726]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:44:51.726 --> 02:44:54.427]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.

[02:45:59.096 --> 02:46:00.637]  During the fall, they'd have it during the winter.
[02:46:02.010 --> 02:46:04.977]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:46:04.977 --> 02:46:09.028]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patreon supply.
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:19.744]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[02:46:42.093 --> 02:46:44.615]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[02:46:44.615 --> 02:46:49.638]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[02:46:49.638 --> 02:46:59.103]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[02:46:59.103 --> 02:47:01.745]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:13.784 --> 02:47:26.031]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:47:26.031 --> 02:47:28.193]  Let me just recap briefly.
[02:47:28.193 --> 02:47:33.716]  Foreign multinational powers are manipulating, sell-out, trader-collaborator elements in our government.
[02:47:33.716 --> 02:47:36.978]  Hollywood, the Democrats, cowards, neocons.
[02:47:39.505 --> 02:47:42.568]  Parlay America into a global government they believe they're building.
[02:47:42.568 --> 02:47:48.092]  But the Chinese, the EU, they're all bidding for power.
[02:47:48.092 --> 02:47:50.254]  They haven't sold out like you have completely.
[02:47:50.254 --> 02:47:52.396]  You're fools.
[02:47:52.396 --> 02:47:53.377]  That's incredibly dangerous.
[02:47:53.377 --> 02:47:54.478]  So along comes a president...
[02:47:55.728 --> 02:47:58.490]  Who sees a business deal and who, you know, he's a Scott.
[02:47:58.490 --> 02:48:03.275]  He's got a German last name, but you know, I think more of the mom got into him than the dad.
[02:48:03.275 --> 02:48:08.279]  And you know, no Scots will turn a piece of coal in their ass into a diamond.
[02:48:08.279 --> 02:48:10.621]  They get so, so, so, so selfish about money.
[02:48:10.621 --> 02:48:11.322]  Nothing against Scots.
[02:48:11.322 --> 02:48:12.763]  I got a little bit of Scott in me.
[02:48:12.763 --> 02:48:19.329]  So Trump sees America getting screwed over and goes, we're super powerful and number one, why should we just throw it overboard?
[02:48:19.329 --> 02:48:22.112]  Well, the globalists had already sold the whole thing out.
[02:48:23.894 --> 02:48:25.575]  And so they're like, dude, we already sold it.
[02:48:25.575 --> 02:48:26.636]  You can't do this.
[02:48:26.636 --> 02:48:27.917]  We have agreements.
[02:48:27.917 --> 02:48:29.959]  And he said, no, you don't.
[02:48:29.959 --> 02:48:31.100]  And he's smart about that.
[02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:32.080]  We'll get this next hour.
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:34.442]  Not smart about how to counter it.
[02:48:34.442 --> 02:48:41.728]  And so now they've built this whole Russian canard to overturn not just the president, but the vice president.
[02:48:41.728 --> 02:48:44.750]  That's what this is really all about.
[02:48:44.750 --> 02:48:52.597]  So imagine the Twilight Zone insanity, that at the end of this whole thing, two plus years of BS,
[02:48:53.553 --> 02:49:07.757]  Roger Stone, Jerome Corsi, Alex Jones, and Dr. David Jones are now the shenner of what he wants to the next month to quote, finish his fake investigation to begin the impeachment.
[02:49:07.757 --> 02:49:10.438]  That's why they want us off air so we can't respond.
[02:49:10.438 --> 02:49:12.198]  But oh, you kept us on air.
[02:49:12.198 --> 02:49:13.219]  Oh, you bought products.
[02:49:13.219 --> 02:49:14.319]  Oh, you prayed for us.
[02:49:14.319 --> 02:49:15.359]  Oh, we're still here.
[02:49:15.359 --> 02:49:17.300]  See, they're not all powerful.
[02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:21.261]  But now, the unstoppable force is meeting the unmovable object.
[02:49:22.458 --> 02:49:24.700]  And that causes explosions.
[02:49:24.700 --> 02:49:27.001]  I'm praying for peace, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:27.001 --> 02:49:35.667]  But I know that the people out there understand we're in a war, a globalist civil war that's coming after our children, our country, our very essence.
[02:49:35.667 --> 02:49:40.850]  And most men just want to put their finger in the wind and say, well, I'm going to go along with this because I'll be safe.
[02:49:40.850 --> 02:49:42.151]  I'll get some more money.
[02:49:42.151 --> 02:49:45.674]  But what good is your money if the whole country goes down?
[02:49:45.674 --> 02:49:49.476]  I want to appeal just to their basic selfishness so they don't have a soul.
[02:49:49.476 --> 02:49:52.118]  This is not good for the average person, even the average sellout.
[02:49:53.058 --> 02:49:56.721]  So, Roger, here we are quantifying this.
[02:49:56.721 --> 02:50:01.625]  We'll get to this next hour why I am ready to denounce Donald Trump.
[02:50:01.625 --> 02:50:03.406]  Why I'm ready to come out against Donald Trump.
[02:50:03.406 --> 02:50:05.087]  And it's not to get Mueller off my ass.
[02:50:05.087 --> 02:50:06.168]  No, no, no.
[02:50:06.168 --> 02:50:09.770]  It's to let Trump know that he's failed those of us that tell the truth.
[02:50:09.770 --> 02:50:11.532]  He's not stood up against censorship.
[02:50:11.532 --> 02:50:14.254]  He's not stood up when he has the power to stop it.
[02:50:14.254 --> 02:50:15.715]  But just in the time we have in this segment,
[02:50:16.707 --> 02:50:21.088]  The persecution, the plan, Hillary Clinton, Pelosi.
[02:50:21.088 --> 02:50:23.469]  I mean, this isn't our opinion.
[02:50:23.469 --> 02:50:26.009]  Listeners, have you ever heard one thing I've said in my life?
[02:50:26.009 --> 02:50:28.070]  This is the biggest alert we've ever put out.
[02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:29.490]  And I'm begging you to hear me.
[02:50:29.490 --> 02:50:33.071]  Because a lot of stuff's been urgent, but now we're to the point.
[02:50:33.071 --> 02:50:34.851]  They're preparing the Civil War.
[02:50:34.851 --> 02:50:36.511]  They're preparing the race war.
[02:50:36.511 --> 02:50:38.272]  The clash of the sexes.
[02:50:38.272 --> 02:50:40.952]  You see all the programming Hillary was supposed to be in.
[02:50:40.952 --> 02:50:42.333]  They said, hey, it doesn't matter.
[02:50:42.333 --> 02:50:43.673]  We'll impeach him as a Russian.
[02:50:45.299 --> 02:50:49.161]  When Hillary's throwing a fit, you know, on that night when Trump wins.
[02:50:49.161 --> 02:50:52.222]  We'll impeach him as a Russian.
[02:50:52.222 --> 02:50:55.324]  And Pelosi will be the Speaker.
[02:50:55.324 --> 02:50:56.504]  And you'll be the Vice President.
[02:50:56.504 --> 02:50:57.685]  And you'll do it together.
[02:50:57.685 --> 02:50:59.245]  We'll make it all about women against men.
[02:50:59.245 --> 02:50:59.986]  We're still gonna win.
[02:50:59.986 --> 02:51:02.327]  And that's been the plan.
[02:51:02.327 --> 02:51:04.208]  That's been the program.
[02:51:04.208 --> 02:51:05.368]  That's been the operation.
[02:51:05.368 --> 02:51:10.771]  So you're getting, from the inside right now, how to stop them.
[02:51:10.771 --> 02:51:13.512]  And what they're doing, because if they remove Trump,
[02:51:15.549 --> 02:51:16.270]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:51:16.270 --> 02:51:23.377]  Notice what's happened in the last several days where the mainstream media and their corporate controlled media has gone into high gear.
[02:51:35.656 --> 02:51:38.357]  Repeating the big lie now over and over again.
[02:51:38.357 --> 02:51:39.897]  Trump works for Putin.
[02:51:39.897 --> 02:51:41.317]  Trump is a Russian asset.
[02:51:41.317 --> 02:51:43.158]  Trump is a Russian traitor.
[02:51:43.158 --> 02:51:48.338]  We're no longer in a realm where you need corroboration or proof or evidence.
[02:51:48.338 --> 02:51:59.981]  Now they want us to believe that just because Andrew Cusin Cooper says something or Chris Cuomo says something or Ari Melber says something or the New York Times or the Washington Post says something, it's true.
[02:51:59.981 --> 02:52:01.341]  It's true because they say it.
[02:52:01.881 --> 02:52:10.987]  That's why they don't want to proceed against Trump on the basis of his tax returns or his business dealings, because that would leave Mike Pence as president.
[02:52:10.987 --> 02:52:15.310]  And although I'm not a great lover of Mike Pence, that's not their plan.
[02:52:15.310 --> 02:52:17.591]  Their plan is very, very clear.
[02:52:17.591 --> 02:52:21.634]  Hoke up some fraudulent charge of Russian collusion.
[02:52:22.208 --> 02:52:25.869]  Between the Trump campaign and the Russian state to win the election.
[02:52:25.869 --> 02:52:30.150]  That gives him the grounds to remove both Donald Trump and Mike Pence.
[02:52:30.150 --> 02:52:37.832]  That constitutionally means Nancy Pelosi would be elevated to the presidency, but the vice presidency would be vacant.
[02:52:37.832 --> 02:52:41.153]  She would then appoint Hillary Clinton to the vice presidency.
[02:52:41.153 --> 02:52:43.273]  Then Pelosi would resign.
[02:52:43.273 --> 02:52:46.554]  I'm imagining she will try and maneuver to stay as Speaker of the House.
[02:52:47.350 --> 02:52:52.455]  Uh, and Hillary Clinton would get that thing which she was not able to get in 2016.
[02:52:52.455 --> 02:52:53.676]  The White House.
[02:52:53.676 --> 02:52:55.197]  That is the plan.
[02:52:55.197 --> 02:52:59.461]  That you've just heard it, you're gonna hear it again, but that is where this is all going.
[02:52:59.461 --> 02:53:02.524]  And I'll tell you what's frightening, Roger, everything you've said here...
[02:53:03.951 --> 02:53:06.513]  You're one of those, you're probably the most truthful person I've ever talked to.
[02:53:06.513 --> 02:53:10.196]  They say you're this dirty trick journalist and you kind of like reveled in it, but it's not true.
[02:53:10.196 --> 02:53:12.738]  Everything you basically said has come true.
[02:53:12.738 --> 02:53:14.199]  And you've never steered me wrong.
[02:53:14.199 --> 02:53:17.722]  You've got uncanny instinct and incredible memory.
[02:53:17.722 --> 02:53:19.103]  I hope when I'm your age I still have that.
[02:53:19.103 --> 02:53:22.946]  I used to have a memory better than yours, but I mean you're older than I am.
[02:53:22.946 --> 02:53:23.747]  And this is it.
[02:53:23.747 --> 02:53:25.188]  We're not just saying this.
[02:53:25.188 --> 02:53:26.589]  This is the law.
[02:53:26.589 --> 02:53:27.610]  This is what they're saying.
[02:53:27.610 --> 02:53:29.512]  They've begun impeachment.
[02:53:29.512 --> 02:53:33.034]  It's here and they plan, as you said, a subplot to prove
[02:53:33.735 --> 02:53:41.185]  But the subplot is the plot that we're these Russians, finally, with Corsi, and then they've got the whole thing.
[02:53:41.185 --> 02:53:43.608]  They bring down the president and the vice president.
[02:53:43.608 --> 02:53:44.990]  This is a national emergency.
[02:53:46.365 --> 02:53:51.729]  Well, and I think people need to understand, Alex, they need to get you and I out of the way.
[02:53:51.729 --> 02:54:00.536]  The subplot that Jerry Corsi is now complicit in, bearing false witness against us, making up nonsense, is to get us off the board.
[02:54:00.536 --> 02:54:07.361]  They seek to destroy me financially, which is why I ask people to go to StoneDefenseFund.com because they're destroying me.
[02:54:07.361 --> 02:54:09.963]  I lost my health and life insurance in December.
[02:54:09.963 --> 02:54:14.286]  This is part of the plan to squeeze me to get me to testify against you.
[02:54:14.286 --> 02:54:15.607]  No, no, people should support you.
[02:54:16.347 --> 02:54:28.675]  And what they've done to InfoWars in an effort to silence you and to cut off our revenues is because they recognize that InfoWars is the early warning system for the coming impeachment.
[02:54:28.675 --> 02:54:32.877]  That's why they have to destroy the two of us and they don't understand our character.
[02:54:32.877 --> 02:54:35.059]  You see, they think that we're like them.
[02:54:35.831 --> 02:54:39.812]  We're in this for money or status or aggrandizement.
[02:54:39.812 --> 02:54:42.733]  They don't understand that we're in this for the country.
[02:54:42.733 --> 02:54:45.634]  I didn't get into politics because I wanted to be a big shot.
[02:54:45.634 --> 02:54:48.934]  If I wanted to be a big shot, I would have kissed George Bush's ass.
[02:54:48.934 --> 02:54:50.255]  I had plenty of opportunity.
[02:54:50.255 --> 02:54:53.636]  Jim Baker begged me to run George H.W.
[02:54:53.636 --> 02:54:55.056]  Bush's presidential campaign.
[02:54:55.596 --> 02:54:56.137]  We're good to go.
[02:55:18.130 --> 02:55:21.391]  We have the President's back, but he needs to have our back.
[02:55:38.955 --> 02:55:53.979]  I've talked to five different people and they say, he's super smart at instincts and politics, he loves America, but he is dumber than a box of rocks when people tell him, here this person's great, like his new Attorney General nominee, and the person is literally Satan.
[02:55:53.979 --> 02:55:58.020]  Maybe Satan came and pledged allegiance to him, but Satan is a liar.
[02:55:58.020 --> 02:55:59.560]  So we're going to go to break and come right back.
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:02.501]  Listen, you heard Roger.
[02:56:02.501 --> 02:56:03.421]  They're trying to destroy him.
[02:56:03.421 --> 02:56:03.761]  Support him.
[02:56:04.813 --> 02:56:09.714]  I'm not worried about the money at the end of the day, but I need money long-term to beat these bastards.
[02:56:09.714 --> 02:56:12.555]  And so, I get so busy, I don't even plug.
[02:56:12.555 --> 02:56:14.396]  Everyone needs to go to InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:56:27.380 --> 02:56:28.360]  T-shirts.
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:31.761]  Alexandra Cortez is a foaming at the mouth methhead dog.
[02:56:32.441 --> 02:56:34.263]  She wanted to arrest Don Trump Jr.
[02:56:34.263 --> 02:56:42.831]  for, she would have him subpoenaed and brought in for criminal charges for saying socialists eat their dogs, Republicans or Conservatives or Capitalists walk them.
[02:56:42.831 --> 02:56:44.432]  I mean, we have that shirt.
[02:56:44.432 --> 02:56:46.534]  Because, I mean, it's like, you're crazy.
[02:56:46.534 --> 02:56:49.837]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, only five reviews, it just came out.
[02:56:49.837 --> 02:56:51.859]  Already 100% review though.

[02:57:03.509 --> 02:57:09.373]  And they got Meth Mouth Cortez, and they got Crypt Keeper Pelosi, and the groom of the stool, Hillary Clinton.
[02:57:09.373 --> 02:57:12.255]  They got all these scumbags, but they don't have guts.
[02:57:12.255 --> 02:57:13.116]  And they don't have will.
[02:57:13.116 --> 02:57:14.477]  They all read off teleprompters.
[02:57:14.477 --> 02:57:17.580]  They all are just a bunch of cowardly filth and hardly even...
[02:57:18.300 --> 02:57:20.442]  Wipe their own, you know what.
[02:57:20.442 --> 02:57:24.665]  So, all I'm telling you is, we're going to defeat them, but we need your financial support today.
[02:57:24.665 --> 02:57:29.709]  Together, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:29.709 --> 02:57:34.113]  But regardless, our number four is going to be the most critical ever.
[02:57:34.113 --> 02:57:37.475]  I'm going to really give Trump a personal message straight ahead and chart the future.
[02:57:37.475 --> 02:57:37.876]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.026 --> 02:57:47.288]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[02:57:47.288 --> 02:57:49.029]  There is no set stasis.
[02:57:49.029 --> 02:57:50.270]  There is no managed system.
[02:57:50.270 --> 02:57:51.911]  There is no un-continuum.
[02:57:51.911 --> 02:57:55.133]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[02:57:55.133 --> 02:57:58.495]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:57:58.495 --> 02:57:59.736]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[02:57:59.736 --> 02:58:00.537]  We'll be here forever.
[02:58:00.537 --> 02:58:01.798]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:58:01.798 --> 02:58:08.662]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[02:58:08.662 --> 02:58:09.243]  We made it.
[02:58:09.243 --> 02:58:11.404]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:58:11.404 --> 02:58:13.226]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[02:58:13.226 --> 02:58:13.586]  And so,
[02:58:13.786 --> 02:58:20.252]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[02:58:20.252 --> 02:58:25.316]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[02:58:25.316 --> 02:58:28.179]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:58:28.179 --> 02:58:30.561]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[02:58:30.561 --> 02:58:34.064]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[02:58:34.064 --> 02:58:35.085]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:58:35.345 --> 02:58:39.630]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[02:58:39.630 --> 02:58:42.312]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[02:58:42.312 --> 02:58:43.574]  I want life!
[02:58:43.574 --> 02:58:44.415]  I want Jesus!
[02:58:46.027 --> 02:58:48.708]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:58:48.708 --> 02:58:55.072]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:58:55.072 --> 02:58:57.033]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[02:59:49.114 --> 02:59:51.744]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:18.948 --> 03:00:24.110]  You know, I've said this many times, it's the truth.
[03:00:24.110 --> 03:00:31.674]  I've been on air 25 years, almost 25 years, and used to maybe once a year I'd say this is the most important broadcast I've ever done.
[03:00:31.674 --> 03:00:36.296]  As you go on through life, things do get more important towards this singularity.
[03:00:36.296 --> 03:00:40.218]  The last few years I've been saying it like every month and every week, but there's hands down
[03:00:41.644 --> 03:00:47.210]  Right now, I've still, despite the fact we're censored and attacked and blocked in many areas, we're still reaching millions of people.
[03:00:47.210 --> 03:00:48.451]  Thanks to you.
[03:00:48.451 --> 03:00:49.613]  And I'll just say, like, thanks to you.
[03:00:49.613 --> 03:00:53.497]  I mean, like, thanks like you're pulling me out of the North Atlantic Ocean when I'm freezing to death.
[03:00:53.497 --> 03:00:57.181]  Or I'm on fire, you're putting a blanket over me.
[03:00:57.181 --> 03:01:00.484]  I mean, words can't describe that.
[03:01:00.484 --> 03:01:01.926]  And we're here now.
[03:01:01.926 --> 03:01:02.547]  And this is real.
[03:01:04.133 --> 03:01:06.154]  And this is so historical.
[03:01:06.154 --> 03:01:16.920]  Next segment, because some stations don't care this segment, we're going to get into what Trump needs to do, how they plan to take him out, hands down most important segment we'll ever do up to this point.
[03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:18.841]  And they fear you.
[03:01:18.841 --> 03:01:26.165]  They fear you grabbing the video once we post it to Infowars.com, our emergency message to Trump, Alex Jones prepares to turn against Trump.
[03:01:28.131 --> 03:01:29.852]  Because he's turned against himself.
[03:01:29.852 --> 03:01:31.072]  He's not facing the real danger.
[03:01:31.072 --> 03:01:35.214]  He's being lied to by a coterie of people around him and Fox News is his bubble.
[03:01:35.214 --> 03:01:37.875]  We're going to talk about this next segment.
[03:01:37.875 --> 03:01:40.896]  That's why they want to shut down when they make their move on Trump and on America.
[03:01:40.896 --> 03:01:42.076]  They don't want us on air.
[03:01:42.076 --> 03:01:45.778]  So our attack on Trump is a loving attack, but it's going to happen.
[03:01:45.778 --> 03:01:49.079]  But Roger, let's get into the anatomy of this to understand the larger enemy structure.
[03:01:49.079 --> 03:01:57.282]  Why did they pick you two years ago to frame the whole WikiLeaks thing, to change the subject from Hillary, and then obviously to try to take me down, now suck us in?
[03:01:58.547 --> 03:02:00.628]  Where do you think that's going?
[03:02:00.628 --> 03:02:02.529]  Well, Alex, I think it's abundantly clear.
[03:02:02.529 --> 03:02:10.154]  Because I was an aide to President Richard Nixon as a very young man, because I lived through Watergate, I've seen this movie.
[03:02:10.154 --> 03:02:18.779]  In all honesty, I may be the one person on the face of the planet who could tell the President how to navigate through these waters and how to use the power he has.
[03:02:19.801 --> 03:02:20.782]  Let's be clear.
[03:02:20.782 --> 03:02:22.063]  He is of pure heart.
[03:02:22.063 --> 03:02:23.704]  His instincts are good.
[03:02:23.704 --> 03:02:31.830]  In some cases, I don't know whether he issues orders and his orders are ignored by the coterie of deep staters that he has surrounded himself with.
[03:02:33.597 --> 03:02:44.946]  We've seen it in the books where they steal documents from his desk, he asks for documents to sign, to issue executive orders, and they stall, they hide them, they hope that he'll forget.
[03:02:44.946 --> 03:02:54.214]  He's trying to run the country, he's trying to beat back the JICOMs, he's trying to negotiate new business deals for the country, new trade deals I should say.
[03:02:54.214 --> 03:03:00.479]  He's trying to seal our border, he's trying to reinvigorate the economy, he's got a few things on his mind.
[03:03:01.079 --> 03:03:06.301]  But, sadly, his tweets are great, but tweets must be backed up with action.
[03:03:06.301 --> 03:03:10.582]  So don't just tweet about internet censorship of your allies.
[03:03:10.582 --> 03:03:12.363]  Order your Justice Department.
[03:03:12.363 --> 03:03:14.663]  We're going to do that in our message next segment.
[03:03:14.663 --> 03:03:18.565]  This now, though, is, you just said it, it's true.
[03:03:18.565 --> 03:03:20.345]  You're kind of the ghost of Richard Nixon.
[03:03:20.345 --> 03:03:22.326]  He wasn't perfect, was pro-America.
[03:03:22.326 --> 03:03:25.307]  The deep state tried to remove him to capture the presidency.
[03:03:26.187 --> 03:03:29.911]  And then make it all-powerful because the oligarchy controlled it.
[03:03:29.911 --> 03:03:35.036]  Trump represents the recapturing that Reagan tried and I think Trump's partially done.
[03:03:35.036 --> 03:03:36.077]  So I think that's it.
[03:03:36.077 --> 03:03:41.102]  They fear you because you are the ghost of Richard Nixon and reportedly one of his best friends in his last years.
[03:03:42.051 --> 03:03:46.474]  I know exactly what the President needs to do right now to save himself, but I am confounded.
[03:03:46.474 --> 03:03:57.302]  Knowing the man for 40 years, having deep affection for him and his parents and his family, and the man himself, I'm perplexed as to why he will not use the power he has to save himself.
[03:03:57.302 --> 03:04:01.245]  And let's be clear, you and I and all of us are bound where I'm ready to die.
[03:04:01.245 --> 03:04:04.287]  I don't want to die, I love life, but whatever, what do we got to do here?
[03:04:05.069 --> 03:04:07.552]  I mean, I'm committed, because these people are bad, so somebody's got to stand up.
[03:04:07.552 --> 03:04:14.341]  But to not have him understand that we're being destroyed while he's being destroyed and he's being lied to.
[03:04:14.341 --> 03:04:20.108]  We're going to come back, Roger, with this message to Trump about what he needs to do, because what's coming, go through everything you just said.
[03:04:20.108 --> 03:04:22.331]  This is your message to the President that...
[03:04:23.550 --> 03:04:27.071]  If he doesn't save himself, he's destroying us as well.
[03:04:27.071 --> 03:04:33.692]  And he's gone so far and his instincts have been good, but that's instincts on policy, not on instincts of who he hires or what he does.
[03:04:33.692 --> 03:04:36.573]  All right, this is a very important segment straight ahead.
[03:04:36.573 --> 03:04:38.013]  It's total red alert.
[03:04:38.013 --> 03:04:42.174]  I cannot ask listeners and viewers enough, think of every way you can.
[03:04:42.174 --> 03:04:45.115]  How do you get this live feed out?
[03:04:45.115 --> 03:04:49.335]  How do you take this later when it's uploaded as a video and get it out to everybody?
[03:04:49.335 --> 03:04:50.856]  Because that's what needs to happen.
[03:04:50.856 --> 03:04:51.536]  Raise the alarm.
[03:04:54.096 --> 03:05:06.632]  CBD rich hemp oil is totally organic, all natural, something God gave us, and it doesn't have THC in it, and it's totally legal in all 50 states.
[03:05:06.632 --> 03:05:08.614]  This is where everybody's going.
[03:05:09.615 --> 03:05:12.798]  This is what your body actually needs.
[03:05:12.798 --> 03:05:23.786]  There are so many different spectrums of this natural oil that comes from him, now legal and lawful in all 50 states, that you need to just go research it for yourself.
[03:05:24.506 --> 03:05:25.787]  This is not marijuana.
[03:05:25.787 --> 03:05:27.508]  There are hundreds of varieties of hemp.
[03:05:27.508 --> 03:05:33.132]  This is industrial hemp that has all the good attributes, but not the bad attributes.
[03:05:33.132 --> 03:05:35.173]  People wonder why I haven't gotten to CBD oil?
[03:05:35.173 --> 03:05:40.697]  Well, because some of the stuff's got problems, some of it can get you high, and some of it can get you arrested.
[03:05:40.697 --> 03:05:41.957]  This is not that.
[03:05:41.957 --> 03:05:43.418]  Legal in all 50 states.
[03:05:43.418 --> 03:05:45.920]  It's from hemp, not marijuana.
[03:05:45.920 --> 03:05:47.421]  It's totally legal.
[03:05:47.421 --> 03:05:53.785]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we can ship to all 50 states right now from the great website, washingtonsreserve.com.
[03:05:59.037 --> 03:06:01.378]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:06:01.378 --> 03:06:16.241]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:16.241 --> 03:06:18.442]  It's Friday, January 18th, 2019.
[03:06:18.442 --> 03:06:21.443]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:06:21.443 --> 03:06:22.563]  As we speak, Robert Mueller.
[03:06:23.652 --> 03:06:35.163]  Through ABC News, The Washington Post has let us know he plans to arrest myself, my father, Roger Stone for hush money payments to W. Jerome Corsi that are 100% total fabrications and lies.
[03:06:36.960 --> 03:06:41.663]  But it's just like the other desperation that's going to be breaking very soon, over the weekend.
[03:06:41.663 --> 03:06:44.965]  Other attempts by Mueller to set up info wars, the documents, all of it.
[03:06:44.965 --> 03:06:48.727]  We didn't leak it, somebody did, so okay, fine, we'll cover it.
[03:06:48.727 --> 03:06:50.328]  Again, they did it themselves.
[03:06:50.328 --> 03:06:51.568]  This is incredible.
[03:06:51.568 --> 03:07:02.355]  Roger, let's speak to the President now about where we stand and what he needs to do if he's going to stop this, because I have to tell President Trump something.
[03:07:03.277 --> 03:07:12.181]  I only got mad at him over a year and a half ago when he promised not to strike Syria and they had a false flag and he did it and I thought he was going back on war mongering and stopping that.
[03:07:12.181 --> 03:07:28.989]  And now I really respect him as Rand Paul does, very proud of him, not wanting to destabilize the Middle East in areas, but wanting to bring back our troops, save the money, to rebuild our infrastructure, take care of our veterans, put in space-based weapons that give us real dominance, not our troops dying in sand and blood.
[03:07:28.989 --> 03:07:29.589]  That said though,
[03:07:30.572 --> 03:07:49.711]  If President Trump won't defend himself and his family, won't recognize what he's doing, won't recognize that his advisors put the worst deep state people in to betray him over and over again, then I'm going to fight the globalists, I'm going to fight for family values, I'm going to fight not to sexualize children, I'm going to fight for sovereignty and better trade deals, but I'm going to abandon President Trump.
[03:07:50.799 --> 03:07:58.744]  Because if something's even a lesser of two evils, if he doesn't take action, he's allowing them to set him up and destroy him.
[03:07:58.744 --> 03:08:09.571]  So in the eight minutes we have left, our message from Alex Jones and Roger Stone about what Trump needs to do to take action or destroy himself and the country.
[03:08:09.571 --> 03:08:15.035]  Well, Alex, I would say beware the Ides of March, because I think that is their game plan.
[03:08:15.035 --> 03:08:17.977]  That's what my sources, that's what your sources are telling us.
[03:08:19.017 --> 03:08:27.126]  Their plan A has always been to try to jack the president up on some bogus, fabricated claim of Russian collusion.
[03:08:27.126 --> 03:08:35.995]  Because you see, that not only removes Donald Trump, but it also would remove Vice President Mike Pence, paving the way for a Pelosi presidency.
[03:08:35.995 --> 03:08:38.858]  She then designates Hillary as her vice president.
[03:08:39.478 --> 03:08:48.509]  Then Pelosi resigns, Hillary becomes president, and the 2016 presidential election is voided.
[03:08:48.509 --> 03:08:50.070]  That is their plan.
[03:08:50.070 --> 03:08:51.933]  Let's make no mistake about it.
[03:08:51.933 --> 03:08:57.459]  Now, the president can do a number of things, but tweeting about them is not going to do it.
[03:08:57.999 --> 03:09:05.325]  A. He needs to order his Justice Department to initiate antitrust action against the Google giants.
[03:09:05.325 --> 03:09:09.168]  Twitter, Facebook, Google, Apple, etc.
[03:09:09.168 --> 03:09:10.129]  Immediately.
[03:09:10.129 --> 03:09:17.135]  Because if we can't communicate among each other, and if we can't amplify his message, his chances of saving his presidency are zero.
[03:09:17.695 --> 03:09:20.997]  Secondarily, the best defense is an offense.
[03:09:20.997 --> 03:09:40.525]  He needs to instruct the Acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker, who's going to be there until Mr. Barr is presumably confirmed, to appoint a special counsel on the matter of Uranium One, convene a grand jury, and bring criminal indictments against everyone involved, including Bill, Hillary, Mr. Mueller, and others.
[03:09:41.178 --> 03:09:54.832]  Thirdly, he needs to limit the probe, which there are constitutional arguments that he can do, of the current Mueller investigation to Russian collusion, of which there is none, zero, nada.
[03:09:54.832 --> 03:10:03.821]  Then, he clearly needs to move to fortify his support in the United States Senate.
[03:10:03.821 --> 03:10:05.122]  The House is history.
[03:10:05.692 --> 03:10:17.860]  The House under the tutelage of Nancy Pelosi, Jerry Nadler, Adam Schiff, Maxine Waters and this cabal of criminals is going to vote articles of impeachment.
[03:10:17.860 --> 03:10:26.126]  Now they don't want to do it on the basis of his tax returns or his real estate developments or the use of his hotels by government officials.
[03:10:26.126 --> 03:10:30.089]  It has to be Russia related because they have to get Pence too.
[03:10:30.729 --> 03:10:38.152]  Although, don't get me wrong, the deep state would be much happier with a Pence presidency as long as they can get rid of Donald Trump.
[03:10:38.152 --> 03:10:50.878]  But Hillary and the globalists and Soros and the shycoms, they want total power, they want implosion of America, men and women fighting with each other, race war, the Democrats are ready to deliver the Marxian takedown.
[03:10:50.878 --> 03:10:54.760]  Well, and let's be very clear what they have in mind for you and me and your dad.
[03:10:55.393 --> 03:11:15.328]  They're going to attempt to indict us for witness tampering, based on a phony allegation put forward by Jerry Corsi, who used to work at InfoWars, that for some reason, payments made to him for the actual work he did at InfoWars constituted hush money.
[03:11:15.328 --> 03:11:16.849]  Hush money for what?
[03:11:16.849 --> 03:11:19.251]  The whole thing is bullshit!
[03:11:19.251 --> 03:11:21.153]  With an F. It's nonsense.
[03:11:22.037 --> 03:11:30.124]  The whole idea that the memo he created documenting the Podesta brothers' Russian involvement was part of a cover story.
[03:11:30.124 --> 03:11:31.746]  That would be what we're supposedly covering up?
[03:11:31.746 --> 03:11:33.307]  And you have all the emails, all the texts.
[03:11:33.307 --> 03:11:34.008]  I was there.
[03:11:34.008 --> 03:11:35.589]  This is insane.
[03:11:35.589 --> 03:11:36.490]  But that's what I mean.
[03:11:36.490 --> 03:11:37.331]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:11:37.331 --> 03:11:42.216]  They're announcing they're going to indict his stepson, who worked for him and reportedly wiped a computer.
[03:11:44.577 --> 03:11:52.639]  It's just, listen, that's why I jumped on him so hard when he first learned that he was putting on all this bull, was because I was there when he was drunk, falling down.
[03:11:52.639 --> 03:11:56.640]  He's like, you're shameful, you and Roger are gonna get it.
[03:11:56.640 --> 03:11:59.021]  I've been with the government for a long time.
[03:11:59.021 --> 03:12:02.782]  And I guess he was like an FBI informer forever, like in Eastern Europe or something.
[03:12:02.782 --> 03:12:06.883]  I mean, I know he wrote all these bestselling books and stuff for Lou Dobbs and everything, but let's talk about that.
[03:12:06.883 --> 03:12:09.723]  He developed the fake birther thing that created division.
[03:12:09.723 --> 03:12:11.244]  This guy pushed QAnon.
[03:12:11.244 --> 03:12:12.384]  I think he is actually Q.
[03:12:14.076 --> 03:12:18.200]  Well, just the fact that he would go on the air with Ari Melber.
[03:12:18.200 --> 03:12:26.587]  Just the fact that he would talk to Shelby Holliday, who is a deep state quizzling and the symbol most... You ever notice, no one will interview me.
[03:12:26.587 --> 03:12:28.549]  Like, I am the guy they will not talk to.
[03:12:30.205 --> 03:12:31.506]  Well, you know what?
[03:12:31.506 --> 03:12:33.408]  Clearly, I'm moving into the same realm.
[03:12:33.408 --> 03:12:42.455]  I mean, very deeply disappointed that Trish Regan, who I really like at Fox, has now give Jerry Corsi a forum twice to defame me, lying with a straight face.
[03:12:42.455 --> 03:12:46.659]  By the way, you can always tell when Jerry's lying, his lips are moving.
[03:12:46.659 --> 03:12:50.142]  But they won't afford me an opportunity to come on and defend myself.
[03:12:50.142 --> 03:12:52.764]  Don't you think they're going to give him the Cohen treatment, though?
[03:12:52.764 --> 03:12:58.449]  That, you know, after they've squeezed everything out of him, they want to discredit him because he worked with him, and they'll just kind of flush him down the toilet?
[03:12:59.258 --> 03:13:00.279]  Oh, there's no question.
[03:13:00.279 --> 03:13:08.186]  He will do his dirty work to try to take us down, but he will not escape the wrath of the special counsel.
[03:13:08.186 --> 03:13:10.107]  They will destroy him, too.
[03:13:10.107 --> 03:13:11.228]  That's the sad part.
[03:13:11.228 --> 03:13:20.677]  You would think with a person of his sophistication, who's been around the block, that he would understand that, but he's getting the worst possible advice from this clown, Larry Klayman.
[03:13:20.677 --> 03:13:23.219]  Also, I think there's a lot of alcohol-induced dementia.
[03:13:24.369 --> 03:13:26.390]  Well, it's true, and people need to understand.
[03:13:26.390 --> 03:13:32.412]  Klayman was ousted from Judicial Watch, an organization he founded, over a sexual harassment claim.
[03:13:32.412 --> 03:13:34.493]  He was also disciplined by the D.C.
[03:13:34.493 --> 03:13:34.873]  Bar.
[03:13:34.873 --> 03:13:38.455]  He was thrown off the Bundy case.
[03:13:38.455 --> 03:13:39.075]  Well, let's be clear.
[03:13:39.075 --> 03:13:42.656]  I don't want to get in a fight with Klayman, but I was walking through the office a few months ago.
[03:13:42.656 --> 03:13:44.377]  I think Owen had him on or something.
[03:13:44.377 --> 03:13:45.558]  He's like, I'm loyal.
[03:13:45.558 --> 03:13:46.478]  Of course he's loyal.
[03:13:46.478 --> 03:13:48.919]  And I hope Alex is loyal.
[03:13:48.919 --> 03:13:50.460]  It was like a hunting dog looking at a rabbit.
[03:13:50.460 --> 03:13:50.820]  I was like,
[03:13:51.460 --> 03:13:52.341]  I was like, what?
[03:13:52.341 --> 03:13:55.124]  And I called you and you go, oh yeah, man, I've been warned.
[03:13:55.124 --> 03:13:57.126]  And it's like, you see this stuff.
[03:13:57.126 --> 03:13:59.248]  And then like, as you know, I don't give an inside baseball.
[03:14:00.120 --> 03:14:07.204]  The media admits that Corsi is the one, like they've got us telling us that we gave him hush money.
[03:14:07.204 --> 03:14:09.125]  It's outrageous!
[03:14:09.125 --> 03:14:10.966]  It's just insane!
[03:14:10.966 --> 03:14:17.569]  It's not like we enjoy attacking people who are ostensibly other conservatives or other Trump supporters because we don't.
[03:14:17.569 --> 03:14:21.291]  But we're not the ones bearing false witness against Jerry Corsi.
[03:14:21.291 --> 03:14:26.074]  Jerry Corsi has agreed to a pack of lies suggested to him by Robert Mueller.
[03:14:26.854 --> 03:14:29.676]  And he intends to be their bitch.
[03:14:29.676 --> 03:14:32.677]  And it is very, very disappointing.
[03:14:32.677 --> 03:14:36.139]  I know you, Alex, and I know myself in my own heart.
[03:14:36.139 --> 03:14:38.360]  I will fight to the bitter end.
[03:14:38.360 --> 03:14:39.921]  You can threaten to indict my wife.
[03:14:39.921 --> 03:14:42.062]  You can threaten to attack my children.
[03:14:42.062 --> 03:14:43.363]  They stand with me.
[03:14:43.363 --> 03:14:45.184]  We will fight.
[03:14:45.184 --> 03:14:46.524]  We have done nothing wrong.
[03:14:46.524 --> 03:14:47.925]  We have broken no laws.
[03:14:47.925 --> 03:14:49.706]  There is no Russian collusion.
[03:14:49.706 --> 03:14:51.707]  There is no WikiLeaks collaboration.
[03:14:51.707 --> 03:14:55.169]  And Jerry Corsi is an alcohol-addled liar.
[03:14:55.769 --> 03:14:57.911]  Who was perfectly willing to throw other...
[03:15:25.689 --> 03:15:29.430]  We're going to introduce Dr. Nick Begich, whose dad was killed, assassinated for being a patriot.
[03:15:29.430 --> 03:15:30.270]  His brother's been a U.S.
[03:15:30.270 --> 03:15:30.831]  Senator.
[03:15:30.831 --> 03:15:32.011]  We'll both introduce him coming up.
[03:15:32.011 --> 03:15:34.232]  But again, one more appeal to the President.
[03:15:34.232 --> 03:15:38.473]  Mr. President, appoint a special counsel to Uranium One.
[03:15:38.473 --> 03:15:41.174]  You know, get Tucker Carlson to advise you.
[03:15:41.174 --> 03:15:42.254]  Bring in Roger Stone.
[03:15:42.254 --> 03:15:43.395]  They're ready.
[03:15:43.395 --> 03:15:44.735]  Tucker Carlson is ready.
[03:15:44.735 --> 03:15:46.215]  Rand Paul is advising you.
[03:15:46.215 --> 03:15:47.516]  Some of the best advice you can get.
[03:15:47.516 --> 03:15:49.356]  Bring them in now.
[03:15:49.356 --> 03:15:50.697]  Roger Stone.
[03:15:50.697 --> 03:15:51.077]  Do it now.
[03:15:53.132 --> 03:15:56.995]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:15:56.995 --> 03:16:01.998]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[03:17:23.977 --> 03:17:27.878]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:27.878 --> 03:17:29.419]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.419 --> 03:17:32.380]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.380 --> 03:17:37.941]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[03:20:05.486 --> 03:20:07.326]  Big Brother.
[03:20:07.326 --> 03:20:09.127]  Mainstream media.
[03:20:09.127 --> 03:20:11.048]  Government cover-ups.
[03:20:11.048 --> 03:20:12.729]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:20:12.729 --> 03:20:14.369]  Well, so does he.
[03:20:14.369 --> 03:20:18.891]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:23.682 --> 03:20:25.163]  Liberals now are all over the news.
[03:20:25.163 --> 03:20:30.704]  They're the newest, biggest group buying guns saying, I'm preparing for civil war with the right-wingers.
[03:20:30.704 --> 03:20:33.245]  Thank God you just joined us and didn't know it.
[03:20:33.245 --> 03:20:36.266]  The Second Amendment is for a tyrannous government.
[03:20:36.266 --> 03:20:43.228]  The sleeping giant that is humanity is rising!
[03:20:52.059 --> 03:20:54.260]  You won't stand up against me or you'll only be a slave.
[03:20:54.260 --> 03:20:59.001]  If you're sad and bullied, they will push you around and make you their slave.
[03:20:59.001 --> 03:20:59.922]  Become men again!
[03:20:59.922 --> 03:21:01.202]  Become women again!
[03:21:01.202 --> 03:21:05.463]  Stand up and tell the New World Order!
[03:21:05.463 --> 03:21:08.524]  You can take our lives, but you'll never take our freedom!
[03:21:08.524 --> 03:21:10.725]  What we are looking at is good and evil.
[03:21:12.298 --> 03:21:17.559]  And for the people above you that are inviting you into their New World Order, they're slaves.
[03:21:17.559 --> 03:21:18.979]  They've sold out to it.
[03:21:18.979 --> 03:21:19.740]  They're blind.
[03:21:19.740 --> 03:21:20.400]  They're cowards.
[03:21:20.400 --> 03:21:22.040]  You don't want to be part of them.
[03:21:22.040 --> 03:21:24.560]  Like Patrick Henry said, forget you are our brethren.
[03:21:24.560 --> 03:21:26.321]  Go from us in peace.
[03:21:26.321 --> 03:21:29.101]  Crouch down and lift the hand that feeds you.
[03:21:29.101 --> 03:21:32.842]  Let your chains sit lightly upon you.
[03:21:32.842 --> 03:21:36.543]  And for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[03:21:44.187 --> 03:21:47.429]  You are receiving this transmission.
[03:21:47.429 --> 03:21:56.093]  You are the resistance.
[03:21:56.093 --> 03:21:59.115]  Exploding to space!
[03:21:59.115 --> 03:22:02.637]  Alright, Nick Baggage, Great Patriots taking over.
[03:22:02.637 --> 03:22:06.519]  I wanted to get final comments from Roger Stone, but I've made my statement to Trump.
[03:22:06.519 --> 03:22:08.020]  I've made my statement to the world.
[03:22:08.020 --> 03:22:13.103]  I've made my statement about how they're now trying to put myself and my dear sweet father in prison.
[03:22:14.437 --> 03:22:20.919]  That makes me want to fight that much harder against these liars and make sure Robert Mueller goes to prison and Hillary Clinton goes to prison.
[03:22:20.919 --> 03:22:24.740]  The stakes are so high and these people, these sociopaths are reaching for it all.
[03:22:24.740 --> 03:22:29.062]  But in closing, Roger, I wanted to give the deep state a warning and have you speak to that because
[03:22:30.256 --> 03:22:40.303]  Trump's right when he told prominent individuals recently that he believes Americans are too well armed, he means that in a good way, and that they will have a civil war if they try to remove him.
[03:22:40.303 --> 03:22:49.009]  Well, that's true if he leads and doesn't just send out tweets and really gets on the offense about what's happening.
[03:22:49.009 --> 03:22:51.651]  I don't want to have that civil war.
[03:22:51.651 --> 03:22:55.073]  But at the same time, I can't, as I've said a thousand times,
[03:22:57.407 --> 03:23:08.772]  The globalists were just boss hogs and they just wanted to run stuff and they weren't trying to teach kids how to have sex with pedophiles or pushing all this evil globalism or bringing in radical Muslims.
[03:23:08.772 --> 03:23:13.094]  I'd oppose them and be for another group that was better but I would not be risking my life.
[03:23:13.094 --> 03:23:20.658]  It's not just an honor, it's a duty and a pleasure and a compulsion to fight this new world order because
[03:23:22.190 --> 03:23:26.053]  Even if I was an atheist, if you look at this globalist system, it's the definition of Satan.
[03:23:26.053 --> 03:23:42.043]  So, I think the establishment needs to know, and all these vitriolic, low IQ people that have some existential envy of success or goodness or whatever it is, that want a war with everybody, I don't think they understand the door they're opening, because I can play a few
[03:23:43.052 --> 03:23:43.292]  You know,
[03:24:14.434 --> 03:24:24.574]  Well Alex, you know, several months ago you told me great detail about a sting operation in which there was an attempt to set you up with faux evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:24:24.574 --> 03:24:25.596]  And I gave you the documents.
[03:24:27.282 --> 03:24:28.023]  I've reviewed them.
[03:24:28.023 --> 03:24:29.403]  It's completely bogus.
[03:24:29.403 --> 03:24:30.323]  But it's outrageous.
[03:24:30.323 --> 03:24:32.944]  It was the most brazen thing I've ever seen.
[03:24:32.944 --> 03:24:37.246]  Just to be clear, you've never taken a dime from any Russian entity.
[03:24:37.246 --> 03:24:38.006]  Period.
[03:24:38.006 --> 03:24:38.787]  None.
[03:24:38.787 --> 03:24:40.027]  RT.
[03:24:40.027 --> 03:24:41.888]  The Internet Research Agency.
[03:24:41.888 --> 03:24:42.688]  Anybody else.
[03:24:42.688 --> 03:24:43.528]  Concord.
[03:24:43.528 --> 03:24:45.869]  This is all BS.
[03:24:45.869 --> 03:24:49.851]  BS that now, sadly, is not only being promulgated by the likes of
[03:24:50.471 --> 03:24:59.599]  Adam Schiff and Robert Mueller and other deep staters, but with the complicity of Dr. Jerry Corsi, Judas Iscariot.
[03:24:59.599 --> 03:25:06.044]  Now he's using MSNBC, CNN to defame me, now to defame you.
[03:25:06.044 --> 03:25:08.726]  People need to understand he's a quizling.
[03:25:08.726 --> 03:25:10.287]  He's a snake in a grass.
[03:25:10.287 --> 03:25:12.669]  He's not a supporter of the president.
[03:25:12.669 --> 03:25:14.671]  He's not the patriot we thought he was.
[03:25:14.671 --> 03:25:18.234]  It's wounding, because I did have some affection for him.
[03:25:18.234 --> 03:25:19.575]  I did have some respect for him.
[03:25:20.055 --> 03:25:33.565]  But now I understand he's prepared to say whatever his new handlers want him to say in an effort to help close Infowars down and destroy you, and more importantly at this point, destroy me because they're afraid I might tell the President.
[03:25:33.565 --> 03:25:34.025]  Let's be honest.
[03:25:34.025 --> 03:25:35.226]  Go ahead and say it.
[03:25:35.226 --> 03:25:35.466]  Go ahead.
[03:25:36.371 --> 03:25:38.792]  Declassify the documents, Mr. President.
[03:25:38.792 --> 03:25:41.352]  Bring the whole house of cards down.
[03:25:41.352 --> 03:25:44.233]  Devin Nunes has seen the FISA warrants.
[03:25:44.233 --> 03:25:48.154]  He knows it leads directly- Jim Jordan, Devin Nunes are amazing patriots.
[03:25:48.154 --> 03:25:50.394]  They've been total- they're willing to fight.
[03:25:50.394 --> 03:25:51.395]  Rand Paul's willing to fight.
[03:25:51.395 --> 03:25:52.895]  And let's expand on that.
[03:25:52.895 --> 03:25:57.116]  One man against a bunch of cowards is, you know, 101 will win.
[03:25:57.116 --> 03:26:04.378]  That's the thing that's so painful about all this, is that we have all the cards, and then we sit back and ask, why doesn't Trump play the cards?
[03:26:06.230 --> 03:26:07.731]  It just confounds me.
[03:26:07.731 --> 03:26:15.818]  And then watching Rudy Giuliani, who I like, and who's an old friend of mine, who I think has the President's best interests at heart.
[03:26:16.585 --> 03:26:20.987]  Say, well, there may have been Russian collusion, but Donald Trump didn't know about it.
[03:26:20.987 --> 03:26:23.549]  What is he talking about?
[03:26:23.549 --> 03:26:27.431]  $30 million, two years in, they don't have a shred, a scintilla.
[03:26:27.431 --> 03:26:32.113]  Well, his full quote was, they haven't found any evidence, but I'm not an omnipresent.
[03:26:32.113 --> 03:26:33.494]  I represent the president.
[03:26:33.494 --> 03:26:34.814]  He 100% hasn't.
[03:26:34.814 --> 03:26:38.196]  Because they don't know, like, there's one more guy talked to a Russian once or whatever.
[03:26:38.196 --> 03:26:39.877]  His full thing makes sense.
[03:26:39.877 --> 03:26:43.299]  He's just being too real with these people, not knowing what liars they are.
[03:26:43.299 --> 03:26:45.180]  Like Steve King said, national.
[03:26:46.280 --> 03:26:50.822]  You know, white supremacism is not the same as nationalism.
[03:26:50.822 --> 03:26:52.763]  And then they turn that into he defends white supremacism.
[03:26:52.763 --> 03:26:57.386]  The quote, any moron can see what it says, but they make it all a false quote.
[03:26:57.386 --> 03:27:05.170]  So I just think his failure is Giuliani doesn't understand we're entering the endgame here, where they are going to lie about the president at every level.
[03:27:06.716 --> 03:27:07.537]  There's no question.
[03:27:07.537 --> 03:27:09.399]  They have shifted into high gear.
[03:27:09.399 --> 03:27:15.865]  So at least previously, you could combat the lies with truth and the lack of evidence, the lack of corroboration.
[03:27:15.865 --> 03:27:17.606]  But now none of that matters.
[03:27:17.606 --> 03:27:20.669]  I watched Anderson Cooper, who I kind of like, to be honest with you.
[03:27:20.669 --> 03:27:23.452]  He's always been very fair with me on the air.
[03:27:23.452 --> 03:27:26.554]  But the other night, insisting that Trump was involved with the Russians.
[03:27:26.554 --> 03:27:27.595]  Well, wait a minute.
[03:27:27.595 --> 03:27:30.098]  What about Barack Obama saying into a hot mic,
[03:27:30.538 --> 03:27:32.238]  After I'm re-elected, I'll have more credibility.
[03:27:32.238 --> 03:27:33.119]  But what about Uranium One?
[03:27:33.119 --> 03:27:38.840]  The crazy part is, they show an image of Trump at G20 meetings, and they go, look, he's with them!
[03:27:38.840 --> 03:27:43.481]  It's like, you read the article, it's like five pages long, there's no proof!
[03:27:43.481 --> 03:27:45.702]  Yeah, it's next level, believe me.
[03:27:45.702 --> 03:27:56.524]  Having them try to say that my dad works for the Russians, and, you know, all the rest of it, is just... I already knew it was BS, but now, it actually makes me not be afraid at all.
[03:27:56.524 --> 03:27:58.545]  It just makes me go into total war mode, because
[03:28:00.188 --> 03:28:04.932]  I mean, my God, why did Bulger work with Mueller to kill all these people and do all this horrible stuff?
[03:28:04.932 --> 03:28:06.993]  Mueller is a drug-dealing pimp.
[03:28:06.993 --> 03:28:10.196]  Mueller is, like, just a horrible psychotic.
[03:28:10.196 --> 03:28:11.937]  And people go, they go, yeah, he's a psychotic.
[03:28:11.937 --> 03:28:12.497]  Back down.
[03:28:12.497 --> 03:28:13.998]  No!
[03:28:13.998 --> 03:28:14.859]  Let me tell you something.
[03:28:14.859 --> 03:28:15.820]  God's gonna deal with Robert Mueller.
[03:28:16.923 --> 03:28:23.828]  And I'm not going to be the one spending 100,000 trillion years in a subterranean dungeon with the devil.
[03:28:23.828 --> 03:28:25.669]  So it's, you know, whatever.
[03:28:25.669 --> 03:28:26.530]  Roger, great job.
[03:28:26.530 --> 03:28:33.094]  I'm going to introduce Nick Begich, whose dad was a famous congressman, clearly murdered, and then of being a patriot, then his brother, a U.S.
[03:28:33.094 --> 03:28:34.596]  senator, about his take on this.
[03:28:34.596 --> 03:28:39.099]  Appreciate you letting me take 30 minutes of it, but this is epic, breaking, global, exclusive news.
[03:28:39.099 --> 03:28:41.901]  They're now trying to put me in prison, my father, everything.
[03:28:41.901 --> 03:28:44.783]  They've got ABC News, The Washington Post, all calling up, salivating.
[03:28:44.783 --> 03:28:46.484]  They're about to run a coup on the president.
[03:28:46.744 --> 03:28:48.311]  We've now entered zero hour.
[03:28:48.311 --> 03:28:49.035]  Thank you, Roger.
[03:28:49.035 --> 03:28:49.658]  God bless.
[03:28:49.658 --> 03:28:50.080]  We'll be back.
[03:28:53.097 --> 03:28:56.679]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:31:17.824 --> 03:31:18.384]  We made it.
[03:31:18.384 --> 03:31:20.566]  And that's really where this goes.
[03:31:20.566 --> 03:31:22.367]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[03:31:22.367 --> 03:31:22.747]  And so,
[03:31:22.947 --> 03:31:29.409]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[03:31:29.409 --> 03:31:34.450]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[03:31:34.450 --> 03:31:37.310]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:31:37.310 --> 03:31:39.711]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:31:39.711 --> 03:31:43.212]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[03:31:43.212 --> 03:31:44.232]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:31:44.492 --> 03:31:48.773]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[03:31:48.773 --> 03:31:51.654]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[03:31:51.654 --> 03:31:52.734]  I want life!
[03:31:52.734 --> 03:31:53.975]  I want Jesus!

[03:32:25.654 --> 03:32:27.375]  There are hundreds of varieties of hemp.
[03:32:27.375 --> 03:32:32.998]  This is industrial hemp that has all the good attributes, but not the bad attributes.
[03:32:32.998 --> 03:32:35.040]  People wonder why I haven't gotten to CBD oil.
[03:32:35.040 --> 03:32:40.563]  Well, because some of the stuff's got problems, some of it can get you high, and some of it can get you arrested.
[03:32:40.563 --> 03:32:41.824]  This is not that.
[03:32:41.824 --> 03:32:43.285]  Legal in all 50 states.
[03:32:43.285 --> 03:32:45.786]  It's from hemp, not marijuana.

[03:33:09.853 --> 03:33:16.518]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[03:33:16.518 --> 03:33:19.841]  I'm a friend of thunder.
[03:33:19.841 --> 03:33:24.364]  Friend as in any wonder lightning strikes me.
[03:33:28.087 --> 03:33:33.429]  I fought with the devil, got down on his level.
[03:33:33.429 --> 03:33:37.150]  But I never gave in, so he gave it for me.
[03:33:37.150 --> 03:33:44.872]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[03:33:44.872 --> 03:33:50.334]  I can spot bad weather, and I'm good at finding shelter in a dam.
[03:33:55.021 --> 03:33:55.342]  Alright!
[03:34:12.125 --> 03:34:14.207]  I want to make this statement here, I want to be very, very clear.
[03:34:14.207 --> 03:34:15.528]  This is not a simulation.
[03:34:15.528 --> 03:34:18.311]  This universe, this planet's real.
[03:34:18.311 --> 03:34:19.112]  Life is real.
[03:34:19.112 --> 03:34:20.653]  Our ancestors are real.
[03:34:20.653 --> 03:34:22.936]  The struggles we've been through are real.
[03:34:22.936 --> 03:34:25.238]  The future we're going towards is real.
[03:34:25.238 --> 03:34:28.921]  And there are good people, and there are deceived people, and there are bad people.
[03:34:29.662 --> 03:34:31.184]  And Dr. Nick Begich has taken over now.
[03:34:31.184 --> 03:34:34.347]  I really appreciate him and the great work he does at EarthPulse.com.
[03:34:34.347 --> 03:34:49.521]  Famous scientist himself, trailblazer, best-selling author, his dad, a famous congressman who helped liberate the lands up there for the people, both native Alaskans, Inuit, and of course the general European and other populations from the United States.
[03:34:49.521 --> 03:34:52.644]  And I think he's uniquely placed, his brother's been a U.S.
[03:34:52.644 --> 03:34:52.945]  Senator,
[03:34:54.315 --> 03:35:03.320]  To just briefly, before he takes over these segments, let me take some time earlier, to speak to political and physical sacrifice for the truth.
[03:35:03.320 --> 03:35:05.542]  Because I'm not up here as a victim.
[03:35:05.542 --> 03:35:10.385]  I'm very honored to be having Mueller openly trying to indict me and my father for no reason.
[03:35:10.385 --> 03:35:16.368]  I am extremely honored to be involved in all this and trying to restart a renaissance because I've never felt closer to God.
[03:35:16.368 --> 03:35:18.249]  In fact, I'm not a masochist.
[03:35:18.249 --> 03:35:18.970]  I don't like pain.
[03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:24.092]  I actually, as this gets worse, feel more fulfilled because I know I'm not bad.
[03:35:24.092 --> 03:35:27.974]  I know I'm American, a human that stood up for humanity.
[03:35:27.974 --> 03:35:30.195]  My nationalism is humanity, but I'm an American.
[03:35:30.195 --> 03:35:31.435]  I'm proud of America.
[03:35:31.435 --> 03:35:33.636]  And so, Nick, I'll take over.
[03:35:33.636 --> 03:35:34.897]  I'll talk a lot, so you take over.
[03:35:34.897 --> 03:35:39.199]  I'm not going to talk again, but your advice to me and everybody else being persecuted tonight
[03:35:39.779 --> 03:35:43.522]  On Friday night, because I know you've been through a lot in your own family, about where we're going.
[03:35:43.522 --> 03:35:46.404]  Because anything worth something is going to be a big price.
[03:35:46.404 --> 03:35:47.645]  You've paid more than I have.
[03:35:47.645 --> 03:35:53.889]  You've paid with your dad, who transferred hundreds of billions of dollars to the people, and we saw what happened.
[03:35:53.889 --> 03:35:58.593]  So tell us about that and your advice to us tonight as we're listening.
[03:35:59.460 --> 03:36:03.263]  You bet, and I'm glad we're on this tonight particularly.
[03:36:03.263 --> 03:36:21.637]  In fact, this is where I really wanted to start my whole program was about this, because my family has three generations at the local, state, and national and international levels in influencing political thinking and how to get ideas into the public domain.
[03:36:21.637 --> 03:36:26.520]  Now that's from the left to the right and everything in between.
[03:36:26.520 --> 03:36:28.742]  You know, when you look at my family's configuration,
[03:36:29.866 --> 03:36:32.728]  But this is the standard practice.
[03:36:32.728 --> 03:36:34.610]  First, they attack you economically.
[03:36:34.610 --> 03:36:37.412]  They did my dad a number of occasions.
[03:36:37.412 --> 03:36:47.519]  When my dad was in his early career as a state senator, we were living, I'll give you a story, we were living on the bases and they gave us 90 days to evacuate the base, basically.
[03:36:47.519 --> 03:36:53.503]  My dad was a superintendent of schools for the military installations here in Anchorage.
[03:36:53.503 --> 03:36:55.704]  And essentially, he was a state senator and a
[03:36:57.845 --> 03:37:01.787]  And a superintendent at the same time, and so they brought it into the state courts.
[03:37:01.787 --> 03:37:05.468]  My dad lost, he couldn't hold two state jobs at the same time.
[03:37:05.468 --> 03:37:07.368]  He had four children at home.
[03:37:07.368 --> 03:37:13.970]  The superintendent paid $18,000 a year, which in the early 60s was a lot of money, and the Senate paid six.
[03:37:13.970 --> 03:37:18.651]  My dad quit the superintendent's job, figured out how to be a builder.
[03:37:18.651 --> 03:37:20.732]  You know, that's a long story, too long for today.
[03:37:21.392 --> 03:37:23.913]  But, he did not cave in.
[03:37:23.913 --> 03:37:25.373]  And that was sort of the first attempt.
[03:37:25.373 --> 03:37:28.413]  You know, there were a lot of attempts through my dad's career.
[03:37:28.413 --> 03:37:35.355]  And when they couldn't bribe him, corrupt him in any way, basically they ended it.
[03:37:35.355 --> 03:37:36.755]  You know, they took him out.
[03:37:36.755 --> 03:37:41.236]  Or at least, when the opportunity to not find him came up, they didn't go get him.
[03:37:41.236 --> 03:37:43.916]  And that's what his... Let's describe, his plane went down, never found.
[03:37:43.916 --> 03:37:46.897]  That's correct.
[03:37:46.897 --> 03:37:48.397]  Just like Larry McDonald and everybody else.
[03:37:49.335 --> 03:37:57.821]  Right, and this was the official story, but unofficially, and then later, FBI telexes proved that this was not the case at all.
[03:37:57.821 --> 03:38:02.384]  In fact, the government did know where they were, didn't recover the bodies.
[03:38:03.476 --> 03:38:14.382]  What's important right now and what I see happening with many of the influence makers around the world, including you, Alex, is we're being, the push is to take us off message.
[03:38:14.382 --> 03:38:18.144]  So they attack us personally with the idea that we're going to come in and just be all defensive.
[03:38:18.144 --> 03:38:22.967]  And I'm glad you, that was the whole point today is it's meant to make us get off message while we defend ourselves.
[03:38:22.967 --> 03:38:23.547]  That's right.
[03:38:23.547 --> 03:38:28.110]  And we, we need to recognize that the defense is in the ideas.
[03:38:28.943 --> 03:38:41.875]  In the debate that we invigorate as policy makers, policy shapers, because that's who you are, that's who I am, that's who Roger Stone is, that's who everybody who engages as a disruptor, the status quo.
[03:38:41.875 --> 03:38:43.637]  And that's what they're really fighting.
[03:38:43.637 --> 03:38:47.441]  So they first try to attack you personally, get you off message, so you're being defensive.
[03:38:49.292 --> 03:38:54.414]  People know who we are because we've been at this a very, very long time.
[03:38:54.414 --> 03:38:55.955]  Myself, 25 years.
[03:38:55.955 --> 03:38:56.975]  You, 23 years.
[03:38:56.975 --> 03:39:02.778]  We've been working together since the very beginning of both of our public work in the international arena.
[03:39:02.778 --> 03:39:06.920]  And staying on message is critical, and providing solutions.
[03:39:06.920 --> 03:39:11.381]  And this is, you know, if you think back, remember when Ross Perot was the big thing in the early 90s?
[03:39:11.381 --> 03:39:13.222]  You were a very young man then.
[03:39:13.222 --> 03:39:17.144]  And it was a guy, Chuck Harder, who had For the People Radio Network.
[03:39:17.785 --> 03:39:25.052]  And when the institutions of the establishment came in to shut him down, it was the snake under the door.
[03:39:25.052 --> 03:39:30.677]  They came in, they infiltrated his organization, and then eventually they took it away from him.
[03:39:30.677 --> 03:39:32.699]  And you never heard again about Ross Perot.
[03:39:32.699 --> 03:39:37.824]  But he was the single biggest policymaker at the time as a broadcaster.
[03:39:37.904 --> 03:39:38.224]  That's right.
[03:39:58.184 --> 03:40:04.629]  And make those calls to your legislative bodies, to your legislators.
[03:40:04.629 --> 03:40:06.070]  Let them know you're watching.
[03:40:06.070 --> 03:40:07.051]  Let them know to re-establish peace.
[03:40:07.051 --> 03:40:12.896]  Don't just think as you're censored on Facebook and Twitter everywhere that you can't march or call or get involved.
[03:40:12.896 --> 03:40:14.497]  And I totally agree with you, Doc.
[03:40:14.497 --> 03:40:16.278]  So what would you say to Trump then?
[03:40:16.278 --> 03:40:19.000]  Clearly the word is they're building up towards a move against him.
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:21.883]  He means well, but he doesn't know how to pick the right people.
[03:40:21.883 --> 03:40:23.044]  He's so betrayed.
[03:40:24.825 --> 03:40:25.846]  They're all around him.
[03:40:25.846 --> 03:40:26.947]  They're all around him.
[03:40:26.947 --> 03:40:30.851]  And he has to be true to himself and his gut and his intuition.
[03:40:30.851 --> 03:40:36.577]  And I would say this, is quit responding to everything they say.
[03:40:36.577 --> 03:40:37.178]  No, I agree.
[03:40:37.178 --> 03:40:39.640]  Like you said, get on his own message.
[03:40:39.640 --> 03:40:41.122]  And Rand Paul said he's really proud of it.
[03:40:41.122 --> 03:40:42.643]  He's trying to pull trips out.
[03:40:42.643 --> 03:40:44.325]  That's Trump's instincts.
[03:40:44.325 --> 03:40:44.845]  But I agree.
[03:40:44.845 --> 03:40:45.906]  Stop responding.
[03:40:45.906 --> 03:40:46.247]  Attack.
[03:40:47.350 --> 03:40:49.971]  Attack on your ideas.
[03:40:49.971 --> 03:41:10.600]  And I would say this, if the media won't cover you, then do the fireside chat once a week, do an hour, and talk directly to the American people, and lay out your ideas for the week, and get rid of, you know, 10% on defense to say what you did actually, and then 90% on what you want to do and where you need the American people.
[03:41:10.600 --> 03:41:10.840]  I agree.
[03:41:10.840 --> 03:41:12.341]  Why do they hate Trump so much?
[03:41:12.341 --> 03:41:16.723]  I mean, because they just act like he is the ultimate evil.
[03:41:17.774 --> 03:41:21.355]  Because he's not playing ball with the established order.
[03:41:21.355 --> 03:41:22.916]  And this is the fact.
[03:41:22.916 --> 03:41:36.742]  The established order is attacking human beings, you and me, everyone, on a very base level, to divide us, to separate us, to create a tribalism that allows for a total breakdown.
[03:41:36.742 --> 03:41:39.763]  And that's where you get totalitarian governments.
[03:41:40.263 --> 03:41:44.106]  You don't get it when people respect each other enough to engage in public debate.
[03:41:44.106 --> 03:41:48.549]  I was about to say, Trump's trying to create real unity about nationalism and free market and innovation.
[03:41:48.549 --> 03:41:48.829]  Right.
[03:41:48.829 --> 03:41:53.212]  And you turn on leftist news, it is like Hitlerian, the division.
[03:41:53.212 --> 03:41:54.573]  Right, and this is the tactic.
[03:41:54.573 --> 03:41:56.174]  It is the tactic.
[03:41:58.570 --> 03:42:02.595]  And it leads to the chaos that we're seeing.
[03:42:02.595 --> 03:42:09.042]  You know, to get back on message and force the left to defend themselves on their issues, right?
[03:42:09.042 --> 03:42:13.827]  Because if your message is first and that's where your focus is, everyone has to respond.
[03:42:14.407 --> 03:42:16.128]  Make sure you stay on message.
[03:42:16.128 --> 03:42:18.430]  That's my message for the President.
[03:42:18.430 --> 03:42:19.610]  Stay on message.
[03:42:19.610 --> 03:42:20.731]  The changes are happening.
[03:42:20.731 --> 03:42:23.373]  Lowest unemployment, high stock markets.
[03:42:23.373 --> 03:42:26.354]  Get in there and do what you said you were going to do with the Federal Reserve.
[03:42:26.354 --> 03:42:28.476]  Take control of our money supply.
[03:42:28.476 --> 03:42:32.818]  Liberate the Treasury and the American public to freedom again, to liberty again.
[03:42:32.818 --> 03:42:34.619]  That's what the President needs to do.
[03:42:34.619 --> 03:42:35.440]  Stay on message.
[03:42:36.457 --> 03:42:37.638]  Nick Begich is on fire.
[03:42:37.638 --> 03:42:38.980]  What an incredible Friday show.
[03:42:38.980 --> 03:42:40.641]  That's probably the most important show I've ever done.
[03:42:40.641 --> 03:42:41.802]  I'm not just saying that.
[03:42:41.802 --> 03:42:44.185]  Whatever you do later after it's archived, get it out, folks.
[03:42:44.185 --> 03:42:45.746]  Nick Begich takes over the final segment.
[03:42:45.746 --> 03:42:49.009]  Then Owen Schroyer and others in the War Room, straight ahead.
[03:42:53.106 --> 03:43:00.568]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.
[03:43:00.568 --> 03:43:09.830]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.
[03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:18.892]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as astaxanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[03:43:19.850 --> 03:43:31.295]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function and more.
[03:43:31.295 --> 03:43:34.777]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas,
[03:43:34.997 --> 03:43:43.581]  We're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate, paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil, or used separately.
[03:43:43.581 --> 03:43:52.726]  It's time to see what krill oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil, now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:43:52.726 --> 03:44:00.429]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[03:44:00.429 --> 03:44:00.910]  It's you!
[03:44:02.011 --> 03:44:04.193]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[03:44:04.193 --> 03:44:12.882]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[03:44:12.882 --> 03:44:17.506]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:44:17.506 --> 03:44:18.947]  You are the info war.
[03:44:18.947 --> 03:44:22.471]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever.
[03:44:23.251 --> 03:44:34.533]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:44:34.533 --> 03:44:42.515]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[03:44:42.515 --> 03:44:49.556]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:44:49.556 --> 03:44:52.297]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[03:44:53.666 --> 03:45:04.275]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:45:04.275 --> 03:45:06.337]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[03:45:06.337 --> 03:45:09.199]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:45:09.199 --> 03:45:10.701]  It's made in the USA.
[03:45:10.701 --> 03:45:10.821]  It's
[03:45:10.981 --> 03:45:11.261]  I think?
[03:45:34.454 --> 03:45:46.098]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:45:46.098 --> 03:45:49.399]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:45:49.399 --> 03:45:53.480]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field and Infowarslife.com.
[03:45:53.480 --> 03:45:55.140]  Defeat the globalists.
[03:45:55.140 --> 03:45:56.881]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:45:56.881 --> 03:45:58.381]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[03:45:58.381 --> 03:45:59.462]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:46:00.422 --> 03:46:05.326]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:46:05.326 --> 03:46:09.129]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:46:09.129 --> 03:46:18.115]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:46:18.115 --> 03:46:27.483]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[03:46:28.163 --> 03:46:32.124]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[03:46:32.124 --> 03:46:38.086]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[03:46:38.086 --> 03:46:41.107]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[03:46:41.107 --> 03:46:42.608]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:46:42.608 --> 03:46:47.809]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[03:46:47.809 --> 03:46:52.231]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[03:46:57.086 --> 03:47:13.436]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.436 --> 03:47:20.600]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Vagic.
[03:47:20.600 --> 03:47:23.382]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:27.040 --> 03:47:35.364]  And welcome back to Infowars.com and this is Dr. Nick Begich and I'm standing in this last bit of time on this last segment.
[03:47:35.364 --> 03:47:49.630]  You know this is a really important issue and you know when I had laid out my program for today I wanted to talk about a lot of the things that we've hit on you know and the timing couldn't be better as these things go.
[03:47:49.630 --> 03:47:55.633]  I had 22 pages of notes I'm not going to refer to any of them at the moment but I want to talk about what
[03:47:56.133 --> 03:48:12.377]  What happens and I want to develop this story a little bit better from a personal perspective, you know, and again, I've been involved in a lot of things politically as an organizer, you know, for all different kinds of initiatives, basically my whole life.
[03:48:12.377 --> 03:48:23.340]  I mean, I was raised in and I'm 60 years old now, you know, my son is now engaged in this in his 40s and and and I think about my dad and then my grandfather even in some of the things he did as
[03:48:24.020 --> 03:48:30.401]  There's a whole history of conflict and sort of resolution starting with a little bit of a rougher period in our history and coming into the 21st century.
[03:48:53.052 --> 03:49:09.866]  What I really want to say today is now, more than ever, is a time for focus, a time for calm in the middle of the storm, and a time to take stock in who we are, what we are, and what's possible.
[03:49:10.567 --> 03:49:15.992]  You know, and I want to get into the little bit of esoteric side of this because it's the essence of what we are.
[03:49:15.992 --> 03:49:20.296]  I believe that we're, you know, spiritual beings occupying physical bodies.
[03:49:20.296 --> 03:49:28.684]  I believe in the divinity of the human being in the sense of being created in the image and likeness of God.
[03:49:28.684 --> 03:49:34.129]  I believe in that as a foundational fundamental of who I am and who we are.
[03:49:34.649 --> 03:49:37.091]  Which means a lot to me.
[03:49:37.091 --> 03:49:45.478]  I mean in a real sense in how I attempt to project in the world and I screw up like everybody else in that projection in the world.
[03:49:45.478 --> 03:49:48.160]  I make mistakes and I learn from them.
[03:49:48.160 --> 03:49:51.163]  But what I also learn is a lot from my adversaries.
[03:49:51.483 --> 03:50:00.326]  I learn a lot from those that would call themselves my adversaries, and I look at them as my information sources, quite frankly.
[03:50:00.326 --> 03:50:03.867]  I want a discussion with those that don't think like me.
[03:50:03.867 --> 03:50:06.348]  I want a discussion, a dialogue.
[03:50:06.348 --> 03:50:09.489]  I want to extract from those that don't think like me
[03:50:10.349 --> 03:50:13.971]  What takes them to the place where they come to their conclusions?
[03:50:13.971 --> 03:50:17.213]  Because I really want the information because it's going to show me a couple of things.
[03:50:17.213 --> 03:50:22.576]  It's going to demonstrate for me what I'm missing so I can be a more fully informed person.
[03:50:22.576 --> 03:50:31.981]  Or it's going to show me clearly what they're missing in information and provide me a gateway, an opportunity, a porthole, if you will, to provide more data.
[03:50:32.541 --> 03:50:38.505]  And maybe end up in a different kind of dialogue, but one that heads eventually towards solutions.
[03:50:38.505 --> 03:50:42.668]  Because this is what participating in a democratic republic is about.
[03:50:42.668 --> 03:50:45.930]  It's about eventually reaching solutions.
[03:50:45.930 --> 03:50:50.313]  Now what the media has done is fail.
[03:50:50.313 --> 03:50:56.257]  Fail in their foundational mission under the First Amendment, which is really intended.
[03:50:56.257 --> 03:50:58.418]  Because when you look at the amendment, it's intended.
[03:50:59.381 --> 03:51:01.422]  To keep a well-informed public.
[03:51:01.422 --> 03:51:02.922]  That's what the press is about.
[03:51:02.922 --> 03:51:06.823]  That's what InfoWars, think about the name itself.
[03:51:06.823 --> 03:51:09.184]  InfoWars.
[03:51:09.184 --> 03:51:11.345]  It's what it was all about.
[03:51:11.345 --> 03:51:14.586]  It's what it's always been about.
[03:51:14.586 --> 03:51:16.846]  Information warfare.
[03:51:16.846 --> 03:51:25.549]  Now, you can look at all the formal forms of propaganda, manipulation, all that stuff that I've covered in other segments, not for today.
[03:51:25.549 --> 03:51:28.190]  Because I want to talk about it more fundamentally today.
[03:51:28.803 --> 03:51:43.850]  That if you truly believe that you're created in the likeness and image of God, then it demands that we have respect for others in a reasonable way, and that we present our arguments in reasonable ways.
[03:51:43.850 --> 03:51:50.373]  Not with anger, not with bitterness, and we talked a little while ago about my dad's disappearance, and then failed to recover.
[03:51:50.373 --> 03:51:54.395]  You know, I was 14 years old when my dad disappeared with the majority of the U.S.
[03:51:54.395 --> 03:51:54.735]  House,
[03:51:55.928 --> 03:51:58.230]  There were six kids in my household.
[03:51:58.230 --> 03:52:01.052]  I was fourteen, the youngest was four.
[03:52:01.052 --> 03:52:07.217]  And my mom in her mid-thirties, you know, had to complete the mission of raising six kids.
[03:52:07.217 --> 03:52:18.947]  You know, and in that, we became very different kind of adults from Republicans, Conservatives, Libertarians, Democrats, you know, everything all across the map.
[03:52:19.685 --> 03:52:27.756]  But we learned how to debate vigorously our beliefs and with a lot of energy our beliefs, but we still embrace each other as brothers and sisters.
[03:52:27.756 --> 03:52:29.759]  We love each other as brothers and sisters.
[03:52:29.759 --> 03:52:34.866]  We define and defend each other's right to free speech no matter what.
[03:52:35.828 --> 03:52:38.630]  We personally felt about what was being said.
[03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:43.134]  This is the model, if you will, that our country began with.
[03:52:43.134 --> 03:52:46.136]  It's the model that all of us should be embracing.
[03:52:46.136 --> 03:52:53.202]  Recognize the divinity of each and every human, and then as we recognize that divinity, step into our divinity.
[03:52:53.202 --> 03:52:56.104]  Self-examination is required right now.
[03:52:56.104 --> 03:53:02.209]  If we're reacting to everything that's coming up in a negative way or in a hostile way, we need to examine ourselves.
[03:53:02.749 --> 03:53:06.932]  We need to look at that again and recognize, is that who we want to be?
[03:53:06.932 --> 03:53:08.393]  Is that how we want to project in the world?
[03:53:08.393 --> 03:53:17.198]  Is that the strength, the power that we wish to display in the world?
[03:53:17.198 --> 03:53:29.266]  That form of ignorant weakness, informed action against a belief system that you embrace, being true and honest is the critical element.
[03:53:29.266 --> 03:53:32.028]  And true speech, think about that as a fundamental.
[03:53:33.402 --> 03:53:38.290]  Now, everyone engages in false speech from time to time.
[03:53:38.290 --> 03:53:40.834]  You know, somebody asks you, how's your day?
[03:53:40.834 --> 03:53:42.977]  And you say, great, when it really isn't.
[03:53:42.977 --> 03:53:43.759]  Are you lying?
[03:53:45.385 --> 03:53:47.606]  Yeah, yeah, you really are.
[03:53:47.606 --> 03:53:50.027]  And so what's the better response?
[03:53:50.027 --> 03:53:52.527]  To say, well, I am having some things going on.
[03:53:52.527 --> 03:53:53.608]  How about the truth?
[03:53:53.608 --> 03:53:58.149]  You know, the truth is transparency and begins to remove the blinders.
[03:53:58.149 --> 03:54:06.632]  We should become a pattern to the truth in our speech and in what we say and recognize the responsibility when we say something.
[03:54:07.455 --> 03:54:11.478]  That that level of responsibility is there.
[03:54:11.478 --> 03:54:18.624]  And so when we're attacked, yeah, okay, they're responsible for the attack, but we are responsible for the response.
[03:54:18.624 --> 03:54:20.045]  And I say stay on message.
[03:54:20.994 --> 03:54:42.528]  I say, make sure that your brain and your heart are connected and your emotion and your intellect tie together and bring into harmony those two aspects of yourself, which could also be defined as, you know, left brain, right brain, you know, the ordered side, the left brain and the chaotic side, the creative side, the right brain.
[03:54:42.528 --> 03:54:46.911]  Think about that in terms of all of the things that divide us.
[03:54:48.796 --> 03:54:52.760]  Women and men, left and right, up and down.
[03:54:52.760 --> 03:54:55.543]  You know, the world negative and positive charges.
[03:54:55.543 --> 03:54:59.366]  You know, the world is polarized, for sure.
[03:54:59.366 --> 03:55:03.230]  The objective is to find unity in the polarity.
[03:55:03.230 --> 03:55:04.992]  Think about this.
[03:55:04.992 --> 03:55:13.420]  This is stewardship of the planet, fundamentally, and stewardship towards each other, divinely created human soul.
[03:55:14.321 --> 03:55:16.582]  This is our responsibility.
[03:55:16.582 --> 03:55:20.843]  This is our calling at the 11th hour, five minutes to midnight.
[03:55:20.843 --> 03:55:27.346]  It's to rise up into what we've been to be created, not violent, angry, bitter souls.
[03:55:27.346 --> 03:55:34.268]  It would be easy and it would have been easy for me to be bitter over what happened in the disappearance of my dad as a young person.
[03:55:35.431 --> 03:55:36.632]  I'm not bitter.
[03:55:36.632 --> 03:55:47.015]  It was in fact, and I've said this at other broadcasts, it was the single biggest, most important, life-changing event in my life.
[03:55:47.015 --> 03:55:54.678]  Both in terms of its negative traumatic impact, but more importantly in how I overcame that impact by recognition.
[03:55:56.178 --> 03:55:58.559]  Recognition that it changed me.
[03:55:58.559 --> 03:56:03.702]  It did what my dad could never do as my parent alive.
[03:56:03.702 --> 03:56:05.103]  He did by the disappearance.
[03:56:05.103 --> 03:56:06.464]  Totally changed me.
[03:56:06.464 --> 03:56:08.565]  I became a very serious young person.
[03:56:08.565 --> 03:56:10.866]  Anyone that knew me then would tell you that.
[03:56:10.866 --> 03:56:16.049]  And my whole life became a different trajectory because I chose.
[03:56:16.049 --> 03:56:22.232]  I chose in the moment of my biggest trauma to choose a different path.
[03:56:22.232 --> 03:56:23.693]  That's called free will.
[03:56:24.793 --> 03:56:28.276]  This is where our divinity takes us.
[03:56:28.276 --> 03:56:30.918]  This is why Alex is fearless.
[03:56:30.918 --> 03:56:33.320]  This is why I have been fearless.
[03:56:33.320 --> 03:56:35.661]  This is why I stay on message.
[03:56:35.661 --> 03:56:43.207]  Because I know this is a short, short stop this lifetime in eternity.
[03:56:43.207 --> 03:56:46.289]  A short stop in who we are.
[03:56:46.289 --> 03:56:49.872]  And what we do here does matter.
[03:56:49.872 --> 03:56:52.414]  And we have to have meaning in that.
[03:56:53.240 --> 03:56:55.021]  Meaning for our individual lives.
[03:56:55.021 --> 03:57:04.046]  So what my suggestion is, look inside, examine your heart, examine your thoughts as you begin to change the world again.
[03:57:04.046 --> 03:57:11.330]  And let us reshape this next century in the image of God.
[03:57:11.330 --> 03:57:11.990]  Wow!
[03:57:11.990 --> 03:57:13.071]  Wouldn't that be something?
[03:57:13.647 --> 03:57:16.828]  Wouldn't that be amazing if we could integrate those values?
[03:57:16.828 --> 03:57:25.370]  And I believe at the five minutes to midnight, the power of God is descending on the planet and the gifts of the Spirit will rise.
[03:57:25.370 --> 03:57:29.291]  And the meek indeed, with sword sheathed, we will be strong.
[03:57:29.291 --> 03:57:32.132]  We will inherit the earth because we are strong.
[03:57:32.132 --> 03:57:33.073]  This is InfoWars.
[03:57:33.073 --> 03:57:37.974]  This has been Nick Begich in this fourth hour, encouraging you in the InfoWars that we're all in.
