[00:00:02.105 --> 00:00:03.787]  Big Brother.
[00:00:03.787 --> 00:00:06.110]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.912]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:07.912 --> 00:00:09.995]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:12.137]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:16.723]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:38.491]  It is November 11th, 2019 on this Monday, live worldwide broadcast.
[00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:41.533]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:53.602]  And a lot of you that watch us on television, we simulcast radio and TV, probably been asking why lately I've been out front when we start the show many times, instead of behind the desk.
[00:00:56.132 --> 00:01:05.859]  Over the years, many times I've gotten up to go to the map wall or go to a video feed and point some things out like a weatherman would do, but this would be a political weatherman.
[00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:23.351]  But with only 357 days left to this historic election, I'm doing it because I want to note visually to everyone that we're not in Kansas anymore, that the world is really on the brink
[00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:33.203]  Of total breakdown and disaster if good people don't exert our full political, cultural, economic, and spiritual will.
[00:01:33.203 --> 00:01:38.544]  Because if we fail at that, we're going to have to exert our physical will because we'll have no other choice.
[00:01:38.544 --> 00:01:44.505]  Because what's coming at us is so damn evil, there will be worldwide massive civil war and violence.
[00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:48.166]  Because if we fail, there will have to be.
[00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:51.347]  And I'm not saying that to sound tough.
[00:01:51.347 --> 00:01:51.987]  It's just a fact.
[00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:57.174]  Now you see when we do exert our will against tyrants, good things happen.
[00:01:57.174 --> 00:02:01.237]  When we don't, all hell breaks loose.
[00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:06.740]  So let me walk towards the camera a little bit here.
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.023]  Something I've never done to really get people's attention.
[00:02:12.023 --> 00:02:20.488]  Because I'm gonna lay out information here on the show today that is of the complete paramount importance
[00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:30.000]  Nikki Haley, the former governor, who became the head U.N.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.864]  ambassador from the U.S., had her issues, and I've had problems with her.
[00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:46.071]  But she at least understands that it's treason when you undermine the president and try to set him up, and when he signs an executive order, you take it and throw it in a trash can.
[00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:51.074]  Or when he says, bring me Infowars.com articles daily, and you refuse to do it,
[00:02:53.226 --> 00:03:08.152]  That is treason against the voters, against the system, because every tyrant group that undermines the president or overthrows the system always says they're doing it for the best of the society.
[00:03:08.152 --> 00:03:20.877]  But now we understand that, and we already knew this was going on, I don't just believe Nikki Haley, we knew this was going on with Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State, former ExxonMobil CEO, and
[00:03:22.227 --> 00:03:29.491]  Former head of Homeland Security and General John Kelly.
[00:03:29.491 --> 00:03:41.759]  And they were not just trying to undermine the president, they were blocking his agenda and then leaking information to cover their ass with the establishment because they came from the establishment.
[00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:49.664]  And because they're not their own men, they're followers who might have physical courage in the case of Kelly, but he doesn't have moral courage.
[00:03:50.575 --> 00:03:55.397]  We're going to roll through this and lay this out and prove it today.
[00:03:55.397 --> 00:03:57.459]  But here's the key.
[00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:11.226]  Understanding how the deep state has already tried to take Trump out the previous two times, we can defeat this third attempt and then stop future attempts.
[00:04:11.226 --> 00:04:13.707]  Because this isn't even about Trump.
[00:04:13.707 --> 00:04:19.510]  This is about due process, about our country, and about we the people, and about us getting control of our government back.
[00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:23.027]  What they're doing is illegal.
[00:04:23.027 --> 00:04:28.831]  And the fact that we forced the deep state out in the open to admit they're doing all this is a seismic event.
[00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:31.352]  So the blueprints of victory are here.
[00:04:31.352 --> 00:04:33.353]  The blueprints of our enslavement are here as well.
[00:04:33.353 --> 00:04:39.137]  We have to go over this judiciously, and we will when we come back after this 60-second break.
[00:04:39.137 --> 00:04:42.739]  Please, however you're watching or listening, tell folks to tune in now.
[00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:44.400]  You're listening on local radio.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.042]  Tell folks it's in the local station.
[00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:53.892]  If you're listening at Band.Video or watching at Band.Video or InfoWars.com or it's last show, be the Paul Revere's this country and the world needs.
[00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:55.394]  Please, everything hangs on you.
[00:05:00.565 --> 00:05:04.229]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:12.216]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[00:05:12.216 --> 00:05:14.798]  It's just that simple.
[00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:21.204]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[00:05:21.204 --> 00:05:21.745]  Others like
[00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:24.406]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[00:05:24.406 --> 00:05:25.126]  Get both.
[00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:26.566]  They're both great for you.
[00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:30.988]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[00:05:30.988 --> 00:05:33.209]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:34.549]  That's why I harp on it.
[00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:38.730]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.971]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long.
[00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:42.732]  It's simple.
[00:05:42.732 --> 00:05:46.953]  Get your high quality iodine at InfoWarsTore.com and help fund the InfoWar.
[00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:49.435]  InfowarStore.com.
[00:05:49.435 --> 00:05:52.117]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.938]  It's the Iodine Challenge.
[00:05:53.938 --> 00:05:56.741]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[00:06:10.345 --> 00:06:15.169]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:16.870]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.532]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:18.532 --> 00:06:24.416]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:29.120]  It was late in 2017, and newspapers across the country reported
[00:06:39.488 --> 00:06:47.474]  That InfoWars was banned from the President reading it in the White House.
[00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:51.617]  And John Kelly later confirmed that indeed that was the case.
[00:06:51.617 --> 00:06:54.680]  Now, we now know in hindsight why that was.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:01.105]  In fact, we knew back at the time via Roger Stone and Mike Cernovich and their sources that were separate but very, very accurate.
[00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:12.996]  Soros, via General McMaster, had gotten Fiona Hill in, who then loaded the National Security Council and the State Department with Soros operatives.
[00:07:12.996 --> 00:07:17.900]  Trump's removed about half of them so far, that we know of.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:27.826]  We specifically, as loyal Americans, who want to stop globalists that have hijacked our nation, specifically exposed
[00:07:30.114 --> 00:07:35.015]  The individuals by name and exactly how they were doing it and how they were sabotaging the president.
[00:07:35.015 --> 00:07:43.598]  We even had sources who would be out at dinner, high-powered donors, billionaires, with McMaster and he would be drunk saying Trump's an idiot, Trump's a fool.
[00:07:43.598 --> 00:07:45.478]  We here in the establishment know how to run things.
[00:07:45.478 --> 00:07:47.139]  He'll be out in just a few months.
[00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:57.802]  They called the president up and couldn't even get him on the phone so they called Roger Stone and they had Roger's phones tapped
[00:07:58.823 --> 00:08:06.266]  He got a bunch of death threats the next day, and so did I. We got told, if you don't keep your mouth shut, you're dead.
[00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:12.269]  And I had people I know call up that have worked high-level CIA, you name it, and threatened me, basically.
[00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:16.831]  I told them, piss up a rope, and you better make sure I don't see you coming.
[00:08:16.831 --> 00:08:19.912]  Because I'm an American, and I'll piss on you.
[00:08:19.912 --> 00:08:21.453]  How's that sound?
[00:08:21.453 --> 00:08:25.615]  So, this is what this all comes down to, is a political clash
[00:08:27.438 --> 00:08:34.042]  That has hijacked the country.
[00:08:34.042 --> 00:08:43.349]  And they think they own it and all they do is glad hand around talking about how smart they are and how great they are and how good they are and how all the rest of us are scum.
[00:08:45.094 --> 00:08:47.775]  And that's where the Hollywood hatred of America comes from.
[00:08:47.775 --> 00:08:49.916]  It's where the Americans are dumb.
[00:08:49.916 --> 00:08:50.976]  America was never great.
[00:08:50.976 --> 00:08:52.417]  It'll never be that great.
[00:08:52.417 --> 00:08:59.159]  You wonder why the mainline professors and mainline universities and mainline Republicans even have that attitude.
[00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:08.363]  Because when you are conquering a nation and selling it off and butchering it and dumbing it down and psychologically demoralizing it and poisoning it, that's all in the WikiLeaks.
[00:09:08.363 --> 00:09:10.423]  You can turn the damn TV on and see it though.
[00:09:10.423 --> 00:09:13.985]  You don't need to know it's in a secret document because you can see it.
[00:09:14.892 --> 00:09:16.153]  Breaking up the family, everything.
[00:09:16.153 --> 00:09:17.334]  We're being poisoned.
[00:09:17.334 --> 00:09:18.615]  That's how you do it, from within.
[00:09:18.615 --> 00:09:20.576]  The rot from within.
[00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:25.259]  There are the 49 secret plans of the communists to bring down the U.S.
[00:09:25.259 --> 00:09:28.021]  and all the famous senatorial reports.
[00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:29.462]  But it wasn't the Russian communists.
[00:09:29.462 --> 00:09:33.265]  It was the globalists who had already taken over Russia and were using the same poison on us.
[00:09:33.265 --> 00:09:35.206]  We ought to read those lists here on air today.
[00:09:35.206 --> 00:09:41.490]  In fact, we will.
[00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.852]  And so, these individuals like John Kelly,
[00:09:45.489 --> 00:09:55.336]  And all of them go into the military so they can make you think they protect America and that they care about the nation, when what they really care about is running it and controlling.
[00:09:55.336 --> 00:10:03.623]  Especially with somebody like... Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut.
[00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:06.165]  And he's in the Marines too.
[00:10:06.165 --> 00:10:08.646]  Well, hell, Benedict Arnold helped found the country.
[00:10:08.646 --> 00:10:10.087]  He was in the Army.
[00:10:10.087 --> 00:10:12.809]  Look at who he was, double agent of the British.
[00:10:12.809 --> 00:10:13.010]  So...
[00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:19.891]  That's who they are, but we already knew what Nikki Haley has come out and said was true.
[00:10:19.891 --> 00:10:23.794]  That they would come to her and say, Trump is an idiot.
[00:10:23.794 --> 00:10:25.235]  He's going to destroy the country.
[00:10:25.235 --> 00:10:32.381]  You've got to help us undermine him and not support him and block his agenda.
[00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:41.769]  When the globalists have sat here and presided over the deindustrialization of America, the dumbing down of America, our life expectancy plummeting,
[00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:50.085]  Infant mortality exploding and all the other curses that are upon the nation.
[00:10:50.085 --> 00:10:53.989]  And then Trump comes in, gets elected, tries to be the president.
[00:10:53.989 --> 00:10:56.170]  Tries to stabilize the economy.
[00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.194]  Tries to have fair deals with China that will bring jobs back.
[00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:10.602]  Gets us out of the globalist compacts that are unconstitutional and that are illegal.
[00:11:10.602 --> 00:11:13.545]  Like these fake so-called Pacific partnerships.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:24.650]  Hillary Clinton and others wrote the TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, and they want him out.
[00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:32.398]  And you learn from what she says exactly what Roger Stone and Mike Cernovich and others all laid out here on air at the time.
[00:11:35.393 --> 00:11:48.436]  And I've got to tell you, all these movements that tell you everything's fine, everybody's secretly good in the government, Trump's about to take down the whole deep state, go back to sleep, everything's okay, Trump's invincible, that's right out of their department, run by them.
[00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:54.437]  In fact, it's currently run by Kelly, I'm told.
[00:11:54.437 --> 00:12:00.738]  Who absolutely hates my guts, and if he could get the green light, guaranteed they'd send somebody for me.
[00:12:00.738 --> 00:12:03.699]  Which, knock yourself out, brother.
[00:12:03.699 --> 00:12:04.959]  Knock yourself out.
[00:12:06.525 --> 00:12:13.851]  So, that's really what's going on here, and we've known about it the whole time, and these people believe they had America.
[00:12:13.851 --> 00:12:19.255]  They were cutting it up and selling it off to the highest bidder.
[00:12:19.255 --> 00:12:23.639]  They literally see us all as flyover country.
[00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:34.807]  And people like Rand Paul is for real, and people like Scalise are for real, and people like Hurley are for real, and people like Jordan are for real.
[00:12:34.807 --> 00:12:35.388]  I'm for real.
[00:12:37.366 --> 00:12:41.887]  Because we're all under attack and you can see it, and Trump's for real.
[00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:51.110]  But everybody else is being threatened, everybody else is being blackmailed, everybody else feels like they're part of the establishment and oh, you've got to save America and the world from Trump.
[00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:57.152]  You're our only hope.
[00:12:57.152 --> 00:13:01.973]  So America has to ask, we want to be ruled by a bunch of bureaucrats, the fourth and fifth estate?
[00:13:03.851 --> 00:13:05.472]  You've seen what they've done to us so far.
[00:13:05.472 --> 00:13:10.674]  You've seen their weaponized alliance with China against us.
[00:13:10.674 --> 00:13:13.215]  You've seen what's being taught in the schools.
[00:13:13.215 --> 00:13:17.357]  That's what the ruling class thinks of you and what they want to do to you.
[00:13:17.357 --> 00:13:19.778]  Because we've always been the big system to conquer.
[00:13:19.778 --> 00:13:21.259]  And they almost had us.
[00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:26.781]  And if they control America, they will control the planet.
[00:13:26.781 --> 00:13:27.362]  And America?
[00:13:29.093 --> 00:13:37.730]  ...was attacked when America was asleep, and then America was put into a globalist-induced cultural, spiritual, economic coma, and we're out of the coma?
[00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:38.151]  We're sick?
[00:13:40.077 --> 00:13:46.200]  We're stumbling around, we got diarrhea running down our legs, but our eyes are getting clear and we see what's going on.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:58.485]  And even though we're in a debilitated state, we're bigger and stronger than these gremlins that had us tied down on the operating table and that we're about to finally finish us off and sell our organs off to the highest bidder.
[00:13:58.485 --> 00:13:59.125]  That's the metaphor.
[00:14:01.158 --> 00:14:03.899]  And I personally am doing everything I can.
[00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:07.560]  I got my hands on a couple of the gremlins, and I'm squeezing them and they're dying.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:07.640]  Ah!
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.720]  Well, they're stabbing me in the guts.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.181]  I'm just, ah!
[00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:12.122]  I don't want to throw these down and grab some more!
[00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:16.343]  The only way I can do that is when you spread the word, and when you buy the products, and when you pray for us.
[00:14:16.343 --> 00:14:19.584]  You do that, I can just start smashing goblins.
[00:14:19.584 --> 00:14:25.506]  Smashing them, smashing them, smashing them, and just fling them up against the wall and break every bone in their body.
[00:14:25.506 --> 00:14:28.847]  And then I'm just going to aim like a big rhinoceros and just run through them.
[00:14:30.834 --> 00:14:37.000]  I'm going to hammer them until the last ounce of our operational capital and will runs out.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.262]  And I believe we're going to overrun them and defeat them.
[00:14:39.262 --> 00:14:41.504]  They can feel the defeat right now.
[00:14:41.504 --> 00:14:42.725]  But it's never been more epic.
[00:14:42.725 --> 00:14:51.674]  The Chi-Coms and the EU and the Hollywood America haters all allied with a bunch of the professional class that has been selling out and carving this country up for 60, 70 years.
[00:14:54.158 --> 00:14:57.763]  British intelligence knows how to take over a country and corrupt its establishments.
[00:14:57.763 --> 00:15:02.871]  It sets up Royal Institute of International Affairs, models, CFRs in every country.
[00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:10.022]  It comes in and buys off the establishment, tells them they're the elite, gets them to slowly, incrementally, generationally sell out their country.
[00:15:11.533 --> 00:15:31.923]  And that's all these people are, that presided over the gang raping of America, want to tell you that sabotaging the election, sabotaging Trump, censoring the internet, calling all the American patriots Russian agents, all the things we've been sending people to shoot up the baseball field, you know that was a deep state operation.
[00:15:31.923 --> 00:15:33.904]  It was a message.
[00:15:33.904 --> 00:15:34.544]  All of that.
[00:15:37.034 --> 00:15:39.176]  is coming down and they're not going to win.
[00:15:39.176 --> 00:15:41.578]  And America is choosing what side it's on.
[00:15:41.578 --> 00:15:45.322]  And they're going to be defeated one way or another, no matter how this goes.
[00:15:45.322 --> 00:15:52.289]  For us individually, they're going to be defeated because the cat's out of the bag, the genie's out of the bottle, the toothpaste ain't going back in the tube.
[00:15:52.289 --> 00:15:55.872]  We know about your treason, you New World Order scum, and you're going down!
[00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.912]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[00:16:01.912 --> 00:16:06.896]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[00:16:06.896 --> 00:16:11.739]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[00:17:00.353 --> 00:17:08.742]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:17:08.882 --> 00:17:18.208]  Bill Hyde here, and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX Microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:23.471]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[00:17:23.471 --> 00:17:35.678]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[00:17:35.678 --> 00:17:36.939]  So here's what you should do right now.
[00:17:36.939 --> 00:17:38.560]  Check out the PPX Microgrid
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:38.880]  Let's go!
[00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:00.621]  Alex Jones.
[00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.925]  Stop the iodine conspiracy.
[00:18:02.925 --> 00:18:04.627]  Wake up the world challenge.

[00:18:14.901 --> 00:18:20.805]  Ladies and gentlemen, X2 and X3 are two amazing formulas of iodine.
[00:18:20.805 --> 00:18:22.466]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[00:18:22.466 --> 00:18:24.467]  See which one works best for you.
[00:18:24.467 --> 00:18:28.750]  Bio-True Selenium from the mustard seed supercharges all of it.

[00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:38.736]  But we're about to have to end this special.
[00:18:38.956 --> 00:18:43.920]  The Everything Must Go Super sale is the main sale, and this sale is part of that sale.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.622]  It's going to have to end by early next week.

[00:20:31.854 --> 00:20:38.477]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart.
[00:20:38.477 --> 00:20:44.980]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.263]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:49.263 --> 00:20:53.465]  Alright, I'm going to open the phones up throughout the entire broadcast.
[00:20:53.465 --> 00:20:57.847]  We have the former lead singer of the Misfits, who's a patriot, also going to be in the studio with us in the third hour.
[00:20:58.922 --> 00:21:06.186]  But wide open phones today that I'll give the number out starting at the beginning of the next segment.
[00:21:06.186 --> 00:21:07.446]  Let me just do this.
[00:21:07.446 --> 00:21:13.309]  I just launched into the Nikki Haley revelations that broke yesterday afternoon.
[00:21:13.309 --> 00:21:18.952]  I'm gonna get back into those and play a bunch of clips coming up here at the start of the next segment.
[00:21:18.952 --> 00:21:22.393]  But I wanted to just do a big picture first 35,000 foot view here.
[00:21:25.762 --> 00:21:38.031]  The Jeffrey Epstein revelations and attempts to cover it up has blown a giant hole in the globalist satanic ecosystem that cannot be repaired.
[00:21:38.031 --> 00:21:42.375]  That's what I wrote yesterday for InfoWars.com.
[00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:43.295]  Now think about that.
[00:21:43.295 --> 00:21:45.577]  That's not just words.
[00:21:45.577 --> 00:21:50.581]  That's not really sexy, scary fiction.
[00:21:50.581 --> 00:21:53.023]  Science fiction meets horror.
[00:21:53.023 --> 00:21:53.943]  Horror fiction.
[00:21:54.924 --> 00:21:56.844]  Science horror fiction.
[00:21:56.844 --> 00:21:57.525]  It's official.
[00:21:57.525 --> 00:22:02.466]  Epstein blew a giant hole in the globalist satanic ecosystem that cannot be repaired.
[00:22:02.466 --> 00:22:04.766]  DC pedophile networks outed.
[00:22:04.766 --> 00:22:08.587]  Dems caught rigging election machines nationwide.
[00:22:08.587 --> 00:22:12.488]  Trump declares we're kicking the New World Order's ass.
[00:22:12.488 --> 00:22:17.149]  He actually said we're kicking the Deep State's ass.
[00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:18.249]  That was Sunday's show.
[00:22:18.249 --> 00:22:19.089]  That's what we covered.
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:29.729]  Because we're in an amazing time, a time of awakening of the biggest zeitgeist anywhere, whether a Navy SEAL or a...
[00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:43.482]  Army Ranger is on TV or somebody's at a football game and gets on a local TV or national television or people on a brewery so they're put on the bottom of each can.
[00:22:43.482 --> 00:22:45.264]  Epstein didn't kill himself.
[00:22:45.264 --> 00:22:52.311]  That act of the people showing how they can communicate in all these incredibly inventive ways
[00:22:53.254 --> 00:22:58.118]  We'll never be able to be stopped by authoritarians or by AI or by any of it.
[00:22:58.118 --> 00:23:10.848]  And it's only when the system starts to try to suppress everyone's speech that people remember how valuable it is and start using it again.
[00:23:10.848 --> 00:23:19.595]  So there is a giant awakening happening, but the globalists knew that was coming, so they're building a post-human world where human activity is obsolete.
[00:23:21.243 --> 00:23:30.609]  And to do that, they don't just make everything robotic and mechanized and technotronic, technocratic.
[00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:46.059]  They domesticate us and literally chemicalize and brainwash the human resistance out of us to where we're helpless beyond domesticated slaves.
[00:23:47.813 --> 00:23:54.598]  And so the fight for human future is really neck and neck between the two sides.
[00:23:54.598 --> 00:24:08.149]  And a lot of people that are actually competent and good people are so tired of trying to wake up the general public that they decide to try to avoid the globalist.
[00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:11.451]  To hide from it.
[00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:12.332]  And when you do that,
[00:24:17.244 --> 00:24:24.068]  When you try to hide from the globalists, then they come looking for you, and they say, no, do this for us, and we'll leave you alone.
[00:24:24.068 --> 00:24:45.139]  And then once they've gotten you to do that first thing, you metaphysically aren't protected by God anymore, and they get you to do more and more and more, and then you find out that you are so close to the devil, while you're right underneath his wing, safe for the moment, but destroyed for eternity.
[00:24:45.139 --> 00:24:45.619]  Think about that.
[00:24:47.193 --> 00:24:49.513]  Think about that.
[00:24:49.513 --> 00:24:54.074]  So this is an amazing time, and I think everybody really realizes now that I'm not just hyping that up.
[00:24:54.074 --> 00:25:06.316]  That's really where we are at this historic, economic, cultural, industrial, spiritual, galactic, infinity jump point.
[00:25:06.316 --> 00:25:14.258]  Fork in the road, crossroads isn't enough of a term, but such a societal,
[00:25:15.475 --> 00:25:18.897]  Cultural species level decision.
[00:25:18.897 --> 00:25:27.581]  And you see the establishment showing folks what side they're on.
[00:25:27.581 --> 00:25:37.226]  You see the lawyers for the whistleblower and others coming out and saying, we like kids, we like pedophilia.
[00:25:37.226 --> 00:25:42.008]  We like to get pedophiles jobs in national security.
[00:25:42.008 --> 00:25:42.829]  Why would you tweet that out?
[00:25:44.053 --> 00:25:56.157]  Because it's about rubbing our noses in it to break our will and normalize it so that when we get upset about it and warn people, people go, oh, just get into it.
[00:25:56.157 --> 00:26:03.219]  So even greater excesses can be exercised and visited upon us.
[00:26:03.219 --> 00:26:04.099]  You feel safe?
[00:26:04.099 --> 00:26:07.540]  You feel good deep inside laying down that?
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.100]  No, you don't.
[00:26:10.538 --> 00:26:12.059]  You want to take action against it, don't you?
[00:26:12.059 --> 00:26:18.645]  Well, the question is, how do we do that effectively without falling into the traps that the system has set for us?
[00:26:18.645 --> 00:26:23.810]  So when we come back, I'm going to get into just how massive, and we cover a lot of really important things here.
[00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.511]  It's all epic.
[00:26:25.511 --> 00:26:28.634]  The fight between good and evil, but Nikki Haley...
[00:26:32.284 --> 00:26:38.869]  It's somewhat politically correct, is a TV ham, but she gets you're not supposed to try to undermine the president.
[00:26:38.869 --> 00:26:41.330]  You're not supposed to sabotage the president.
[00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:58.242]  And she knows it's going to come out in the deep state criminal investigations that are going on about who was running the coup against the president that General Kelly and Rex Tillerson and others were working with Hillary Obama, Mueller,
[00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.812]  And all the rest of them.
[00:27:03.812 --> 00:27:05.375]  Because that's what they do.
[00:27:05.375 --> 00:27:07.719]  They're from the establishment.
[00:27:07.719 --> 00:27:10.222]  And then what they did is treasonous.
[00:27:11.892 --> 00:27:19.697]  Kelly's quoted as saying, well, I'm trying to save the country and give the president the best advice there is in the government on things that are happening.
[00:27:19.697 --> 00:27:22.559]  If that's undermining him, then guilty as charged.
[00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:24.460]  No, we know what you did.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.682]  You would take his decisions and block them.
[00:27:26.682 --> 00:27:27.703]  You'd throw stuff away.
[00:27:27.703 --> 00:27:28.763]  You'd brag about it.
[00:27:28.763 --> 00:27:30.044]  You'd shoot your mouths off.
[00:27:30.044 --> 00:27:41.552]  You'd call him names because you would get in such a furor of the support you were getting in the establishment and the orgy of Trump hating that you would all shoot your mouths off.
[00:27:42.585 --> 00:27:56.009]  The truth is this loser, this big baby with this fake New York Times, reportedly John Bolton, written by the New York Times, anonymous book about Trump being such a buffoon.
[00:27:56.009 --> 00:28:01.930]  It's just more of Fire and Fury and more of all the rest of it.
[00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:07.712]  That's coming out, you know, right as the impeachment warms up into Thanksgiving with the vote in the House and then into Christmas.
[00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:13.486]  And by the time you figure out one thing's a hoax, they've got a new hoax, and a new hoax, and a new hoax.
[00:28:13.486 --> 00:28:16.828]  And Lindsey Graham is saying, hey, don't worry.
[00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:18.269]  It'll be dead on arrival.
[00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:27.094]  No, ladies and gentlemen, because they're going to spring a bunch of other crap on the way to the Senate, and they're going to twist those arms until they break off in the Senate.
[00:28:27.094 --> 00:28:30.135]  All they need is 20 senators.
[00:28:30.135 --> 00:28:30.535]  And so...
[00:28:32.142 --> 00:28:37.566]  I wouldn't take the confidence talk from Graham as if it's a sure thing.
[00:28:37.566 --> 00:28:38.867]  My gut's never wrong.
[00:28:38.867 --> 00:28:45.591]  And I'm telling you that this whole country and President Trump and the world is in grave danger.
[00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:49.374]  So, guard yourself for true.
[00:28:49.374 --> 00:28:51.615]  Infowars.com.
[00:28:51.615 --> 00:28:55.678]  It's where the defense of human liberty and a pro-human future lives.
[00:28:58.337 --> 00:29:00.298]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:00.298 --> 00:29:05.620]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.200]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:15.543]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:15.543 --> 00:29:21.245]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:21.525 --> 00:29:22.025]  I don't think so.

[00:29:59.372 --> 00:30:01.554]  All of our bodies are different.
[00:30:01.554 --> 00:30:04.336]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:07.359]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:12.143]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something you don't know.
[00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:13.024]  But I'm here to tell you.
[00:30:14.111 --> 00:30:23.300]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life completely changes.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:23.961]  I'm healthier.
[00:30:23.961 --> 00:30:25.302]  I have more energy.
[00:30:25.302 --> 00:30:26.123]  I lose weight.
[00:30:26.123 --> 00:30:26.904]  I look better.
[00:30:26.904 --> 00:30:28.466]  Everybody notices.
[00:30:28.466 --> 00:30:31.148]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit
[00:30:32.009 --> 00:30:35.750]  To take X2 Body's Ultimate Turmeric.
[00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:40.811]  I'm gonna commit to flush my gut out with the Gut Fusion from InfoWars Life.
[00:30:40.811 --> 00:30:45.732]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[00:30:45.732 --> 00:30:51.113]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about is Gut Fusion.
[00:30:51.113 --> 00:30:52.233]  Folks, check it out.
[00:30:52.233 --> 00:30:53.753]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:30:53.753 --> 00:30:55.133]  50% off right now.
[00:30:55.133 --> 00:30:56.694]  The sale's about to end.
[00:30:56.694 --> 00:30:57.294]  Gut Fusion.
[00:30:57.294 --> 00:30:58.254]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:59.147 --> 00:31:01.328]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:01.328 --> 00:31:06.589]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me, and she had her digital textbook.
[00:31:06.589 --> 00:31:17.472]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table, and I clicked on iodine, and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough iodine.
[00:31:17.472 --> 00:31:21.633]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy, and it's not true.
[00:31:21.633 --> 00:31:24.354]  But, Dad, it's right here on the periodic table.
[00:31:24.354 --> 00:31:24.994]  When I click it,
[00:31:25.234 --> 00:31:26.455]  Saying exactly what you said.
[00:31:26.455 --> 00:31:28.056]  And I said, I know, honey.
[00:31:28.056 --> 00:31:32.538]  That's why I have you take a high-quality, nutraceutical-grade iodine.
[00:31:32.538 --> 00:31:35.080]  It's because it's why you're so vibrant.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.400]  It's why you're so alive.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:42.444]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age.
[00:31:42.444 --> 00:31:46.246]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself.
[00:31:46.246 --> 00:31:51.469]  To know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion, are mentally retarded.
[00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:54.651]  On the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[00:31:54.651 --> 00:31:56.852]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[00:31:56.852 --> 00:32:07.177]  InfoWars.com Please support us as well and spread the word about the transmission and remember your financial support is what makes this possible.
[00:32:07.177 --> 00:32:08.558]  Plus we make it easy.
[00:32:08.558 --> 00:32:17.283]  We have really great products at InfoWarsStore.com and we have the Alexa Pure Breeze that every year around this time we are able to offer at their cost.
[00:32:17.643 --> 00:32:21.488]  And then we're given a rebate for the new year when we purchase these.
[00:32:21.488 --> 00:32:23.711]  This is what I have to pay taxes on.
[00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:26.093]  This is $147 is the cost with free shipping.
[00:32:26.093 --> 00:32:27.335]  They've never done a deal that good.
[00:32:27.335 --> 00:32:28.556]  It's a hot item.
[00:32:28.556 --> 00:32:30.879]  They sell tens of thousands of these a year.
[00:32:30.879 --> 00:32:32.922]  It's a four-stage ion cluster.
[00:32:32.922 --> 00:32:34.063]  Other competing brands are $400, $500, $600, $700.
[00:32:34.063 --> 00:32:34.544]  All the markup.
[00:32:38.007 --> 00:32:40.688]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we usually sell these all day long for $2.50.
[00:32:40.688 --> 00:32:42.509]  They're a great deal.
[00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.609]  $1.47.
[00:32:42.609 --> 00:32:46.271]  I've told the guy, like, this cuts into the market.
[00:32:46.271 --> 00:32:48.152]  Selling this low, people don't appreciate it.
[00:32:48.152 --> 00:32:50.213]  Well, this is what the InfoWars audience gets.
[00:32:50.213 --> 00:32:54.735]  InfoWarshore.com, there's only a few hundred of these left at this price.
[00:32:54.735 --> 00:33:01.939]  And then more don't come in until next year.
[00:33:01.939 --> 00:33:04.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:11.875 --> 00:33:14.517]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:14.517 --> 00:33:19.619]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.081]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:46.081 --> 00:33:48.882]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:48.882 --> 00:33:52.283]  And we're only here on air because of you.
[00:33:52.283 --> 00:34:04.967]  And if you just joined us, Nikki Haley's revelations simply confirm everything that we'd already told you about not just the Democrat deep state, but the Republican deep state trying to take the president out.
[00:34:04.967 --> 00:34:09.689]  I'm going to go to these clips and break it down and give out the number here in just a moment.
[00:34:10.249 --> 00:34:24.035]  Now, as a lot of you know, I said that the Everything Must Go Mega Special was going to end last Sunday, and I usually extend sales a couple days because I'm so busy covering news and stories and filing reports.
[00:34:24.972 --> 00:34:31.177]  That I never have time to come up with the new sale until the old sale is supposed to already be over.
[00:34:31.177 --> 00:34:37.601]  And because of election fraud in Kentucky that we pioneered and broke with our investigative journalist, it's just earth-shaking.
[00:34:37.601 --> 00:34:42.184]  And all the probably 20 hours I've spent on that since last Friday.
[00:34:42.184 --> 00:34:50.430]  And just all the other continual big breaking stories that I'm filing and putting out and all the other things I'm doing here.
[00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:52.512]  I was up here till
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:57.081]  Eight o'clock at night every day last week on average.
[00:34:57.081 --> 00:34:57.942]  Some nights, ten o'clock.
[00:34:57.942 --> 00:34:59.423]  Some nights, seven o'clock.
[00:34:59.423 --> 00:35:00.143]  But I was up here.
[00:35:00.143 --> 00:35:02.244]  I've been up here seven days a week.
[00:35:02.244 --> 00:35:03.605]  And I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:35:03.605 --> 00:35:05.926]  This is an important time.
[00:35:05.926 --> 00:35:11.369]  And it's very hard to not stay in the gunner's seat when you've got targets.
[00:35:11.369 --> 00:35:15.251]  And the fight for liberty is so close against evil.
[00:35:15.251 --> 00:35:17.072]  So that's why there isn't new specials.
[00:35:17.072 --> 00:35:20.173]  And quite frankly, there may not be for a couple days.
[00:35:20.173 --> 00:35:23.255]  Because I just have so much to do.
[00:35:24.659 --> 00:35:32.941]  And so much research to do on critical things that I'm not able to look at all the inventory and go over it all and come up with a new specials.
[00:35:32.941 --> 00:35:39.583]  But I'll tell you this, what I told Tim Frechet that runs this last week, as I said, just things that are almost sold out.
[00:35:39.583 --> 00:35:41.764]  We can't not have inventory of a lot of this.
[00:35:41.764 --> 00:35:44.024]  Take them off sale.
[00:35:44.024 --> 00:35:45.425]  So that's what's happened with the sale is
[00:35:47.108 --> 00:35:52.512]  The hundreds of great items there, upwards of a third of them or more now, have either sold out or about to sell out.
[00:35:52.512 --> 00:35:59.417]  So they're going off from sale at 50% off to regular price to Super Blue fluoride free toothpaste.
[00:35:59.417 --> 00:36:02.039]  We have plenty of the children, so it's still a 50% off.
[00:36:02.039 --> 00:36:03.661]  That's an example of what's going on.
[00:36:04.994 --> 00:36:05.314]  That's right.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.302]  Several thousand of these in, and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[00:36:40.302 --> 00:36:52.769]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste, and it doesn't compete with Super Blue that's four to five colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free.
[00:36:52.769 --> 00:36:54.530]  The adult or the children's.
[00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:58.093]  These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers.
[00:36:58.093 --> 00:36:58.693]  People love it.
[00:37:00.267 --> 00:37:10.090]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:14.611]  Then it has the patented silver salt.
[00:37:14.611 --> 00:37:17.312]  Silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause gingivitis.
[00:37:17.312 --> 00:37:18.132]  This is all proven.
[00:37:18.132 --> 00:37:20.173]  You can make claims with this.
[00:37:20.173 --> 00:37:21.713]  And so much more.
[00:37:21.713 --> 00:37:24.314]  And it's concentrated as well.
[00:37:24.314 --> 00:37:26.715]  Now it costs more to produce than Super Blue.
[00:37:27.867 --> 00:37:35.629]  And it's apples and oranges, so this is not meant to compete with Super Blue that has thousands and thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:37:35.629 --> 00:37:46.513]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[00:37:47.602 --> 00:37:51.646]  A lot of the cleansing toothpastes really do cleanse them, but they eat your teeth.
[00:37:51.646 --> 00:37:53.247]  This is designed by my father.
[00:37:53.247 --> 00:37:58.592]  He's still got his license, but he's a retired dentist and oral surgeon working with the top silver producers.
[00:37:58.592 --> 00:38:03.015]  The folks that put this out are the ones that supply the silver products to the hospitals and over the counter as well.
[00:38:03.015 --> 00:38:04.897]  They put out the silver wound gel you love so much.
[00:38:04.897 --> 00:38:07.519]  They're the only ones in the country allowed to private label.
[00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:12.460]  That, this is not a private label like the Super Silver Wound Gel.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.421]  This is proprietary that we made with them.
[00:38:14.421 --> 00:38:24.163]  The silver cream, the face cream with the hyaluronic acid and all the key minerals and vitamins that people love, men and women, they're the ones that helped us make this.
[00:38:24.163 --> 00:38:26.544]  Two years in the making.
[00:38:26.544 --> 00:38:26.964]  Two years.
[00:38:28.994 --> 00:38:31.515]  And it doesn't have the iodine.
[00:38:31.515 --> 00:38:32.295]  It's the only way.
[00:38:32.295 --> 00:38:33.836]  It's different from Super Blue.
[00:38:33.836 --> 00:38:35.196]  So, we're really proud of it.
[00:38:35.196 --> 00:38:36.117]  It funds the operation.
[00:38:36.117 --> 00:38:37.957]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:38:37.957 --> 00:38:40.278]  It will sell out in the next two, three days.
[00:38:40.278 --> 00:38:51.062]  But the good news is, in December, it looks like they're manufacturing it in Denver right now.
[00:38:51.062 --> 00:38:52.783]  So, it's being made in Denver right now.
[00:38:54.796 --> 00:38:58.061]  And again, you've got to pay for the patents and all of it to have the silver saw.
[00:38:58.061 --> 00:39:03.989]  So that's why even discount 25% is $14.95 because this is not your regular toothpaste.
[00:39:03.989 --> 00:39:07.554]  I can sell super silver, you know, products.
[00:39:08.766 --> 00:39:13.650]  Discounted like the skin cream because we don't have to pay for the patent for that even though it has the patented ingredients in it.
[00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:14.891]  I was able to get a better deal.
[00:39:14.891 --> 00:39:15.572]  Not on this.
[00:39:15.572 --> 00:39:16.893]  It's still amazing.
[00:39:16.893 --> 00:39:18.695]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:39:18.695 --> 00:39:20.936]  Up to 12 hours of protection.
[00:39:20.936 --> 00:39:23.719]  Natural whitening and coral calcium carbonate.
[00:39:23.719 --> 00:39:26.841]  Silver salt, nano silver infused toothpaste.
[00:39:26.841 --> 00:39:28.483]  Winter mint.
[00:39:28.483 --> 00:39:29.544]  Triple action.
[00:39:31.954 --> 00:39:32.074]  Yes.
[00:39:49.568 --> 00:39:50.469]  Protein bars.
[00:39:50.469 --> 00:39:55.535]  All of it has to go off sale, because most of it's getting close to selling out.
[00:39:55.535 --> 00:39:58.920]  And I've got to reassess and find out what's coming back in and what the new sales are going to be.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:03.405]  But I'll be honest, I just can't turn away and do marketing when I'm tired after the show.
[00:40:03.405 --> 00:40:06.028]  I can't get excited about marketing, even though the products are great.
[00:40:06.028 --> 00:40:08.011]  But I can still get excited about the New World Order.
[00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:09.792]  I have endless energy on that.
[00:40:09.792 --> 00:40:16.295]  I literally, when I'm tired, I cannot do marketing or any of this, or planning, or products, or money stuff.
[00:40:16.295 --> 00:40:17.595]  I just don't care about it.
[00:40:17.595 --> 00:40:21.237]  I can just keep going and going and going and going and going, fighting the globalists.
[00:40:21.237 --> 00:40:22.557]  I think a lot of you are the same way.
[00:40:22.557 --> 00:40:26.139]  I can work till midnight every night, no problem, if I'm fighting the New World Order.
[00:40:26.139 --> 00:40:29.000]  And I understand getting money in here is the same as fighting them.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.801]  It just doesn't click something in me.
[00:40:31.749 --> 00:40:34.111]  But the products are amazing and I'm glad you're excited about them.
[00:40:34.111 --> 00:40:40.076]  I'm excited about them, it's just not to the foaming at the mouth level, pun intended, with the toothpaste that I am with this.
[00:40:40.076 --> 00:40:42.318]  Okay, I'm going to stop there.
[00:40:42.318 --> 00:40:44.480]  We're neck and neck funding ourselves into next year.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.582]  I want to expand.
[00:40:46.582 --> 00:40:48.344]  Look at it as an investment in your future.
[00:40:48.344 --> 00:40:50.065]  Look at how the globalists want to shut down.
[00:40:50.065 --> 00:40:55.550]  Look at how the internal coup against the president with John Kelly and
[00:40:56.468 --> 00:41:00.653]  Rex Tillerson, with the Deep State, with the Democrats, and we first told you about that.
[00:41:00.653 --> 00:41:02.095]  That's why they wanted us destroyed.
[00:41:02.095 --> 00:41:08.643]  Because we had guests on exposing, by name, who the Deep State globalists are.
[00:41:08.643 --> 00:41:09.905]  Who the fake whistleblower is.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.021]  Sierra Mela and all of them.
[00:41:13.021 --> 00:41:19.644]  And they were in Foreign Affairs and all the big global publications saying, shut Jones up, get him off air.
[00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:27.248]  They were having House Armed Services Committees and Senate Intelligence Committees saying, Jones is a Russian agent.
[00:41:27.248 --> 00:41:28.849]  He needs to be taken off air.
[00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:29.729]  He needs to be arrested.
[00:41:29.729 --> 00:41:30.490]  You want me to play the clips?
[00:41:31.749 --> 00:41:32.970]  A lot of people go, man, how are you taking that?
[00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:33.570]  Are you scared?
[00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:34.270]  Yeah.
[00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:36.551]  I'm scared we're going to let them still run things.
[00:41:36.551 --> 00:41:37.972]  I'm scared for my children.
[00:41:37.972 --> 00:41:39.012]  I'm scared for me.
[00:41:39.012 --> 00:41:40.373]  These people are out of control.
[00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:44.795]  They're the globalists selling the country out, saying, I'm a Russian agent.
[00:41:44.795 --> 00:41:47.956]  Oh, now that's been disproven, so now we're Ukrainian agents.
[00:41:47.956 --> 00:41:48.536]  Bull!
[00:41:48.536 --> 00:41:49.277]  I'm an American.
[00:41:50.117 --> 00:41:53.039]  I care about freedom and I'm not going to be their slave.
[00:41:53.039 --> 00:42:06.807]  They are a bunch of baby-killing, devil-worshipping scum that run it, and then a bunch of yes-men that love to be told how smart they are, and how great they are, and how they're the best, and how they're going to save America from us evil Americans in flyover country.
[00:42:06.807 --> 00:42:09.508]  They have this elitist attitude towards everybody and I'm sick of it.
[00:42:09.508 --> 00:42:10.189]  They're not elitist.
[00:42:11.488 --> 00:42:14.932]  All these people in the government at that level got there by brown nosing.
[00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:17.775]  They got there by being yes men, and that's why they were promoted.
[00:42:17.775 --> 00:42:20.898]  Trump came from the outside, just like I did, just like you do.
[00:42:20.898 --> 00:42:22.700]  And that's why they're so scared of us.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.144]  And that's why we're still on air thanks to you and our local affiliates.
[00:42:26.144 --> 00:42:26.765]  And I'll say this.
[00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:34.187]  It's just as important to support Infowars as it is to support the local affiliates who are... These shows put us on.
[00:42:34.187 --> 00:42:36.448]  We're standing up for babies.
[00:42:36.448 --> 00:42:37.688]  Most of your churches aren't.
[00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:40.829]  I would give your money to the local radio stations that you hear us on.
[00:42:40.829 --> 00:42:49.972]  Literally, I'd make a tithe weekly or monthly instead of those local churches that won't do a damn thing but make you feel good about eternity while selling out civilization.
[00:42:49.972 --> 00:42:51.632]  Alright, I'm gonna stop ranting.
[00:42:51.632 --> 00:42:55.533]  I promise I'm gonna have a hardcore report on the treason that's been discovered and confirmed.
[00:42:55.533 --> 00:42:56.874]  It's so bombshell.
[00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:57.274]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.461 --> 00:43:03.145]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[00:43:03.145 --> 00:43:11.134]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[00:43:11.134 --> 00:43:13.716]  It's just that simple.
[00:43:13.716 --> 00:43:20.123]  X3 is the deep-earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[00:43:20.123 --> 00:43:20.664]  Others like
[00:43:21.204 --> 00:43:23.305]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[00:43:23.305 --> 00:43:24.025]  Get both.
[00:43:24.025 --> 00:43:25.485]  They're both great for you.
[00:43:25.485 --> 00:43:29.907]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:32.108]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[00:43:32.108 --> 00:43:33.468]  That's why I harp on it.
[00:43:33.468 --> 00:43:37.649]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[00:43:37.649 --> 00:43:39.810]  Lower IQ makes you sluggish.
[00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:40.890]  You don't live as long.
[00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:41.651]  It's simple.
[00:43:41.651 --> 00:43:45.892]  Get your high quality iodine at InfoWarsTore.com and help fund the InfoWars.

[00:43:48.354 --> 00:43:51.035]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[00:43:51.035 --> 00:43:52.857]  It's the Iodine Challenge.
[00:43:52.857 --> 00:43:55.638]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[00:43:59.365 --> 00:44:06.008]  The Witch Queen of the Deep State lost the 2016 election because she was arrogant.
[00:44:06.008 --> 00:44:14.633]  And the corporate whores in the media busily covering up her giant pedophile and blackmail rings thought that her victory was assured.
[00:44:14.633 --> 00:44:18.435]  Now that the enemy lost that election, they are awakened.
[00:44:18.675 --> 00:44:21.256]  Throwing everything they've got at us.
[00:44:21.256 --> 00:44:26.797]  And conservatives and nationalists and Christians and patriots, many of them, are asleep thinking 2020's in the bag.
[00:44:26.797 --> 00:44:29.378]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost Kentucky governorship.
[00:44:29.378 --> 00:44:33.279]  We just lost the Virginia Statehouse the first time in 30 years.
[00:44:33.279 --> 00:44:34.459]  This is serious.
[00:44:34.459 --> 00:44:38.060]  We can win again and secure the gains we've gotten.
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.981]  Or we can see it all wash down the drain.
[00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:48.277]  Whatever you do, get more politically activated than you ever have and spread the live links at man.video and infowars.com forward slash show.

[00:44:59.318 --> 00:45:01.520]  The Alex Jones Show!
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:06.784]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me, and she had her digital textbook.
[00:45:06.784 --> 00:45:17.673]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table, and I clicked on iodine, and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough iodine.
[00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:21.836]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy, and it's not true.
[00:45:21.836 --> 00:45:24.538]  But, Dad, it's right here on the periodic table.
[00:45:24.538 --> 00:45:25.199]  When I click it,
[00:45:25.399 --> 00:45:26.620]  Saying exactly what you said.
[00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.241]  And I said, I know, honey.
[00:45:28.241 --> 00:45:32.724]  That's why I have you take a high-quality, nutraceutical-grade iodine.
[00:45:32.724 --> 00:45:35.246]  It's because it's why you're so vibrant.
[00:45:35.246 --> 00:45:36.587]  It's why you're so alive.
[00:45:36.587 --> 00:45:42.631]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age.
[00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:46.433]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself.
[00:45:46.433 --> 00:45:51.657]  To know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion, are mentally retarded.
[00:45:52.097 --> 00:45:54.838]  On the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[00:45:54.838 --> 00:45:57.038]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[00:45:57.038 --> 00:46:03.660]  InfoWars.com The time has come to defy the Thought Police.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:07.141]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:16.104]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[00:46:17.458 --> 00:46:20.441]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[00:46:20.441 --> 00:46:26.889]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[00:46:26.889 --> 00:46:33.957]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:36.500]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:41.381]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[00:46:41.381 --> 00:46:45.283]  We have a it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap.
[00:46:45.283 --> 00:46:46.143]  It's black and white.
[00:46:46.143 --> 00:46:46.643]  Very nice.
[00:46:46.643 --> 00:46:48.124]  It has the okay symbol on it.
[00:46:48.124 --> 00:46:49.944]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[00:46:49.944 --> 00:46:51.945]  Infowars.com is on the back.

[00:47:18.058 --> 00:47:23.601]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:23.601 --> 00:47:32.746]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:32.746 --> 00:47:36.708]  Look at the headline at newswars.com.
[00:47:36.708 --> 00:47:38.029]  Look at the headline at Bandon Video.
[00:47:40.371 --> 00:47:42.173]  Monday Live.
[00:47:42.173 --> 00:47:46.716]  Nikki Haley reveals attempted sabotage against America and President Trump.
[00:47:46.716 --> 00:47:48.518]  That's what it is.
[00:47:48.518 --> 00:47:55.403]  Attempts to derail Trump and subvert 2016 election is 100% textbook treason.
[00:47:55.403 --> 00:47:56.464]  Wow!
[00:47:56.464 --> 00:47:59.967]  And now we're 47 minutes into that live broadcast.
[00:47:59.967 --> 00:48:02.269]  I'm gonna open the phones up throughout the rest of the broadcast.
[00:48:02.269 --> 00:48:03.290]  We have a guest in studio.
[00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:06.693]  We'll be taking calls then as well in the third hour.
[00:48:11.451 --> 00:48:20.695]  We're going to get to the video clips here in a moment, but the toll-free number to join us, I want to give first-time callers a chance to respond to this in the first round of calls.
[00:48:20.695 --> 00:48:26.178]  Next hour, you can call in then if you're a longtime caller or disagree, agree.
[00:48:26.178 --> 00:48:27.699]  You can call in as well, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[00:48:27.699 --> 00:48:29.159]  First-time callers, what should Trump do about this?
[00:48:29.159 --> 00:48:29.920]  We already know this.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.280]  He already discovered this.
[00:48:40.182 --> 00:48:44.104]  This is the government, the bureaucracy, believing it owns this country.
[00:48:44.104 --> 00:48:44.424]  877-789-2539.
[00:48:44.424 --> 00:48:50.148]  Remember what President Trump said in a speech a few weeks ago?
[00:48:50.148 --> 00:48:52.869]  He said the hardest government he's had to deal with is the U.S.
[00:48:52.869 --> 00:48:53.710]  government.
[00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:54.950]  Because it's not the U.S.
[00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:55.410]  government.
[00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:57.652]  It's the imperial globalist court.
[00:48:57.652 --> 00:49:01.634]  They transferred America into an imperial empire.
[00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:10.916]  And they want the American people to pay for that corporate empire that benefits the chi-coms and them.
[00:49:10.916 --> 00:49:14.399]  That's the incredible treason.
[00:49:14.399 --> 00:49:16.581]  877-789-2539.
[00:49:16.581 --> 00:49:22.445]  We'll take your phone calls, but please share that live link from newswars.com.
[00:49:22.445 --> 00:49:30.132]  It doesn't get censored as much on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and by your text message and by your word of mouth, because if you aren't the Paul Revere's,
[00:49:31.678 --> 00:49:33.779]  If you don't get the information out, nobody will.
[00:49:33.779 --> 00:49:38.580]  And this isn't like we're some leftist or mainline conservative show claiming we're the zeitgeist.
[00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:39.861]  We're the zeitgeist.
[00:49:39.861 --> 00:49:41.561]  You are the zeitgeist.
[00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:43.542]  Literally.
[00:49:43.542 --> 00:49:44.582]  With Kelly.
[00:49:44.582 --> 00:49:46.503]  It was in the New York Times, the Washington Post, everywhere.
[00:49:46.503 --> 00:49:53.745]  But I confirmed inside the White House, it was do not let him have Infowars.com.
[00:49:53.745 --> 00:50:00.408]  Do not let the President talk to people like Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:50:01.874 --> 00:50:04.495]  They tried to keep Trump Jr.
[00:50:04.495 --> 00:50:06.815]  out, who brings him the truth.
[00:50:06.815 --> 00:50:12.437]  Trump doesn't know all of this stuff until people show him.
[00:50:12.437 --> 00:50:17.918]  And he knows we exposed Fiona Hill first, here.
[00:50:17.918 --> 00:50:23.560]  We exposed Ciara Mella, here, simultaneously with Mike Cernovich.
[00:50:25.999 --> 00:50:30.603]  And the Deep State thought that Cernovich and I had the same sources.
[00:50:30.603 --> 00:50:34.426]  We learned later they were different sources.
[00:50:34.426 --> 00:50:36.328]  And I never out sources.
[00:50:36.328 --> 00:50:39.130]  He had quite a few, and still does.
[00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:43.374]  But it was public that Don Jr.
[00:50:43.374 --> 00:50:44.575]  was releasing information.
[00:50:44.575 --> 00:50:47.438]  So when I released that, I was not releasing that one of his sources was Don Jr.
[00:50:49.707 --> 00:50:50.907]  You still got pissed off about it?
[00:50:50.907 --> 00:50:52.148]  No, no, fine.
[00:50:52.148 --> 00:50:58.249]  I guess that draws attention to what's already admitted, but there are a bunch of other sources, and then inside Google sources, and everywhere else.
[00:50:58.249 --> 00:51:15.934]  Why do you think, on this show repeatedly, it's been brought up by James O'Keefe, that when we get all these videos inside Twitter, Facebook, and Google, it's you, it's Infowars, it's the number one thing, they name you, that their bosses want you shut down.
[00:51:15.934 --> 00:51:18.115]  You must have really done something, James O'Keefe said.
[00:51:18.115 --> 00:51:19.055]  Yeah, we did something!
[00:51:21.274 --> 00:51:43.280]  We accurately assessed the geopolitical system and the ruling political class in this nation that hates America and has now externalized the hierarchy where the hatred of America and the globalist ideology of the people at the top of it is now openly taught everywhere.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.581]  And the British under Cecil Rhodes tried this from about the 1890s to the 1940s.
[00:51:46.581 --> 00:51:46.801]  It failed.
[00:51:50.691 --> 00:52:01.898]  It wasn't the British people, but they called them Anglophiles, they called it an Atlantic accent, where Americans who were in the first movies and on radio would talk with a British accent.
[00:52:01.898 --> 00:52:06.280]  And Americans were taught to drink tea and love the Queen, and all the tabloids.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:09.462]  Ever wonder why you go to the checkout counter, it's the Queen and how great she is?
[00:52:09.462 --> 00:52:19.268]  British intelligence spent hundreds of billions of dollars in the last 120 years or so, or more, making you love the monarchy!
[00:52:21.186 --> 00:52:24.809]  We had a war with that monarchy.
[00:52:24.809 --> 00:52:32.996]  Churchill wrote three books, the history of the English-speaking peoples, about how he wanted to merge the empire with America, and it happened.
[00:52:32.996 --> 00:52:35.318]  I'm not even against people that are anglophiles.
[00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:38.000]  I'm proud of my British background.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:44.445]  The point is, or Welsh, a little bit north of the British, it doesn't matter.
[00:52:44.445 --> 00:52:48.529]  It's the global corporate system that uses pedophilia and corruption.
[00:52:48.529 --> 00:52:49.970]  It's not British, it's globalist.
[00:52:51.463 --> 00:52:55.346]  They perfected it through the British East India Company and all these corporate governance systems.
[00:52:55.346 --> 00:52:57.788]  That's all this is.
[00:52:57.788 --> 00:53:01.612]  And so John Kelly and all these people came up through that.
[00:53:01.612 --> 00:53:03.793]  The ExxonMobil head?
[00:53:03.793 --> 00:53:18.906]  They all tell Trump they're loyal to his face, how smart he is to his face, and then they, behind his back, try to sabotage the agenda, try to leak, try to remove him from office because they were put in by the establishment.
[00:53:18.906 --> 00:53:19.947]  You ask, why does Trump then
[00:53:21.685 --> 00:53:27.452]  Well, he thought the former head of the Border Patrol would be good, Kelly.
[00:53:27.452 --> 00:53:31.557]  And Kelly, you know, had a good resume.
[00:53:31.557 --> 00:53:35.922]  And the same thing with Tillerson, but they still came out of the swamp.
[00:53:35.922 --> 00:53:41.649]  But now Trump knows, you saw him a month ago say, anybody that's been a member of Trump or I don't care who you are, you're out of my administration.
[00:53:43.643 --> 00:53:56.834]  And now you've got the anonymous book being written by the New York Times coming out, I think, this week, right before the impeachment, officially, that starts from secret kangaroo hearings to the show trial.
[00:53:56.834 --> 00:53:57.855]  And think about Trump.
[00:53:57.855 --> 00:54:03.980]  He's got to have the never-Trumper vitamin.
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:06.683]  He's still in the White House on the National Security Council.
[00:54:06.683 --> 00:54:09.445]  He can't even get rid of these people.
[00:54:09.445 --> 00:54:10.466]  They're all around him.
[00:54:13.746 --> 00:54:17.547]  Undermining, sabotaging, lying, leaking disinfo.
[00:54:17.547 --> 00:54:31.891]  And then when you've got this Eric Sierra Mela that we expose as a CIA operative trying to overthrow Trump two plus years ago in late 2017.
[00:54:31.891 --> 00:54:35.192]  That's what the CIA does is overthrow countries.
[00:54:35.192 --> 00:54:41.474]  And now the rogue leftist globalist America-hating CIA run by all these blue bloods
[00:54:42.878 --> 00:54:51.200]  All these libtards, all these libtards that have a heart on for America because they're all limp-wristed cowards.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:57.121]  And the Ciremella's lawyer can't stop talking about how much he admires Epstein when he was in jail.
[00:54:57.121 --> 00:54:59.702]  And how he has pedophile clients.
[00:54:59.702 --> 00:55:06.943]  How he gets some national security clearances and how much he loves visiting children's parks, taking photos with them.
[00:55:06.943 --> 00:55:08.263]  Sick, man.
[00:55:08.263 --> 00:55:10.744]  But you know they think they're better than us because we put up with it.
[00:55:12.779 --> 00:55:16.580]  And they're dug in!
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:26.502]  Now the federal government funds drag queen story time, and so does the EU, because they want you to get used to your kids sitting in the laps of big fat men dressed like women.
[00:55:26.502 --> 00:55:28.202]  But oh, the bad guy's Trump.
[00:55:28.202 --> 00:55:29.303]  But he's the big buffoon.
[00:55:29.303 --> 00:55:30.083]  He's the big idiot.
[00:55:30.083 --> 00:55:32.623]  He's the guy they were going to defeat.
[00:55:32.623 --> 00:55:33.904]  But he beat them.
[00:55:33.904 --> 00:55:35.144]  Coming from the outside.
[00:55:35.144 --> 00:55:35.944]  Self-made.
[00:55:35.944 --> 00:55:37.805]  His own system outside of their system.
[00:55:37.805 --> 00:55:39.125]  And that's why they hate Mavericks.
[00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:46.005]  It's why if you get into the whole Homeland Security thing, they're worried about individuals that have leadership that they don't control.
[00:55:46.005 --> 00:55:47.208]  Because it's a power cult!
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:57.342]  It's a coup against the election of 2016.
[00:55:57.342 --> 00:56:03.346]  And they intend to win because everything these losers have done is bet on finally defeating America.
[00:56:03.346 --> 00:56:05.007]  They can't win any war they launch.
[00:56:05.007 --> 00:56:09.290]  They just make trillions off of it and feed our men and women into meat grinders.
[00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:10.191]  They're totally inept.
[00:56:10.191 --> 00:56:13.453]  They didn't see the fall of the Soviet Union, the fall of the Berlin Wall.
[00:56:13.453 --> 00:56:21.819]  They just sit around, flying around all rich and powerful with their thumbs in their rear ends, a bunch of blue-blood, inbred, social retards.
[00:56:23.527 --> 00:56:24.668]  Remember Bush Sr.
[00:56:24.668 --> 00:56:29.291]  didn't know what a food scanner was 15 years after they were ubiquitous?
[00:56:29.291 --> 00:56:31.772]  They're on their own planet!
[00:56:31.772 --> 00:56:36.555]  We all step and fetch and bow down to them so we think that's just the way it is.
[00:56:36.555 --> 00:56:47.522]  I'm gonna go to the break and come back and take your phone calls and get to these Nikki Haley clips and all the rest of it but here's from the vault two years ago when they're reporting that InfoWars is banned in the White House by John Kelly.
[00:56:50.413 --> 00:57:02.617]  According to Gizmodo, the new White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has told President Trump's aides to not bring the president any news stories from InfoWars, a conspiracy theory website funded by Alex Jones.
[00:57:02.617 --> 00:57:06.478]  This website covers stories such as child slavery on Mars.
[00:57:06.478 --> 00:57:13.320]  Another website, Axios, says that Got News, a website run by far-right blogger Chuck Johnson, has also been banned.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:18.342]  Johnson said to the Washington Examiner, we and the alternative media won the election for Trump.
[00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:24.533]  Ladies and gentlemen, a million dollars you can find me say there's slave colonies on Mars.
[00:57:24.533 --> 00:57:25.073]  Never said it.
[00:57:25.073 --> 00:57:27.174]  Just totally a lie.
[00:57:27.174 --> 00:57:30.116]  But that's who these people are.
[00:57:30.116 --> 00:57:34.679]  They've had their foot on America's neck for a long time because we were asleep.
[00:57:34.679 --> 00:57:35.960]  Now we're not asleep.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:37.761]  And all they're doing is pissing us off.
[00:57:37.761 --> 00:57:40.362]  The only question is how bad is it gonna go for them?
[00:57:40.362 --> 00:57:41.703]  Ha!
[00:57:41.703 --> 00:57:43.344]  A sick part of me hopes they remove Trump.
[00:57:43.344 --> 00:57:45.446]  It's gonna blow up in their face ten times worse.
[00:57:45.446 --> 00:57:45.886]  The red bug.
[00:57:48.345 --> 00:57:52.489]  The time has come to defy the Thought Police.
[00:57:52.489 --> 00:57:55.992]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[00:57:55.992 --> 00:58:06.302]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[00:58:06.302 --> 00:58:08.705]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[00:58:09.265 --> 00:58:15.712]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[00:58:15.712 --> 00:58:22.780]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.323]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[00:58:25.963 --> 00:58:30.207]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[00:58:30.207 --> 00:58:34.110]  We have a it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap.
[00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:34.971]  It's black and white.
[00:58:34.971 --> 00:58:35.472]  Very nice.
[00:58:35.472 --> 00:58:36.953]  It has the okay symbol on it.
[00:58:36.953 --> 00:58:38.774]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[00:58:38.774 --> 00:58:40.776]  Infowars.com is on the back.

[00:59:07.626 --> 00:59:11.467]  And then we're given a rebate for the new year when we purchase these.
[00:59:11.467 --> 00:59:12.687]  This way, we don't have to pay taxes on it.
[00:59:12.827 --> 00:59:16.072]  This is $147, is the cost, with free shipping.
[00:59:16.072 --> 00:59:17.294]  They've never done a deal that good.
[00:59:17.294 --> 00:59:18.516]  It's a hot item.
[00:59:18.516 --> 00:59:20.820]  They sell tens of thousands of these a year.
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:22.883]  It's a four-stage ION cluster.
[00:59:22.883 --> 00:59:24.025]  Other competing brands are $400, $500, $600, $700.
[00:59:24.025 --> 00:59:24.546]  All the markup.
[00:59:27.970 --> 00:59:30.631]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we usually sell these all day long for $2.50.
[00:59:30.631 --> 00:59:32.472]  They're a great deal.
[00:59:32.472 --> 00:59:32.572]  $1.47.
[00:59:32.572 --> 00:59:37.134]  I've told the guy, like, this cuts into the market, selling this low.
[00:59:37.134 --> 00:59:38.135]  People don't appreciate it.
[00:59:38.135 --> 00:59:40.176]  Well, this is what the InfoWars audience gets.
[00:59:40.176 --> 00:59:44.738]  InfoWarsHore.com, there's only a few hundred of these left at this price.
[00:59:44.738 --> 00:59:51.461]  And then more don't come in until next year.
[00:59:51.461 --> 00:59:54.082]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:05.563 --> 01:00:12.866]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.866 --> 01:00:20.030]  Oh, the MI6 founder and main funder of the White Helmets.
[01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:29.094]  So ISIS, al-Nusra, al-Qaeda could jump back and forth between the ambulances and to their mortars and heavy machine guns.
[01:00:29.094 --> 01:00:32.596]  Just got found dead in his home in Turkey.
[01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:34.697]  Guess he didn't complete the mission like he was supposed to.
[01:00:35.956 --> 01:00:38.258]  So now the cleanup crews are out.
[01:00:38.258 --> 01:00:41.780]  Another so-called James Bond.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:45.323]  Found out that James Bond's just a fantasy.
[01:00:45.323 --> 01:00:47.464]  This is the reality.
[01:00:47.464 --> 01:00:48.665]  Pushing daisies now.
[01:00:48.665 --> 01:00:52.728]  Hmm.
[01:00:52.728 --> 01:00:54.769]  Wonder, wonder what happened to him.
[01:00:54.769 --> 01:00:56.050]  He looks so young and healthy.
[01:00:56.050 --> 01:01:00.413]  I wonder how John McCain's doing.
[01:01:00.413 --> 01:01:01.694]  He helped set all that up too.
[01:01:04.002 --> 01:01:06.242]  Not doing too well now.
[01:01:06.242 --> 01:01:06.462]  So!
[01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:13.484]  I'm going to go to your phone call starting next segment.
[01:01:13.484 --> 01:01:23.105]  And I think then I'll play these clips too that all go together and just recap briefly.
[01:01:23.105 --> 01:01:30.186]  But think about how we've gotten comfortable with just the terms of mainstream news saying we're in a civil war.
[01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:30.787]  Between who?
[01:01:30.787 --> 01:01:32.567]  Who are the sides?
[01:01:32.567 --> 01:01:33.027]  And that
[01:01:34.158 --> 01:01:38.659]  The President was sabotaged by Secretary of State and his Chief of Staff.
[01:01:38.659 --> 01:01:42.400]  They were undermining him, trying to get him removed.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:46.461]  Trying to stop the will of the people.
[01:01:46.461 --> 01:01:47.141]  Sabotaging.
[01:01:47.141 --> 01:01:48.902]  When he signed executive orders, they just throw them away.
[01:01:48.902 --> 01:01:53.703]  He'd say, declassify this, and they wouldn't do it.
[01:01:53.703 --> 01:01:59.045]  They protected the deep state.
[01:01:59.045 --> 01:02:00.105]  And now, yeah, print me that article.
[01:02:01.055 --> 01:02:03.917]  Yeah, now Mainline News is saying, oh, the Civil War's begun.
[01:02:03.917 --> 01:02:05.518]  Yeah, where'd you hear that first?
[01:02:05.518 --> 01:02:11.242]  And I'm not up here saying, hey, we told you this, hey, we told you that first, to go, oh, look, we're big, we're smart.
[01:02:11.242 --> 01:02:17.787]  The deep state wants us off air because we are actually looking at the real blueprints.
[01:02:17.787 --> 01:02:25.092]  We're not singing from some choir hymn of leftist garbage or establishment rhino bilge.
[01:02:25.092 --> 01:02:26.793]  We've done the original research.
[01:02:26.793 --> 01:02:28.514]  We know what we're talking about.
[01:02:28.514 --> 01:02:29.275]  We have the real
[01:02:31.227 --> 01:02:35.649]  We've got Randy, Joe, Brian, Alex, Thomas, Jimmy, James, Terry, Steve, Jeff, Josh, and others.
[01:03:02.486 --> 01:03:29.706]  I'm going to be very judicious and very focused and I'm going to play five clips when we come back in the next ten minute segment and just lay out the magnitude because again I say this constantly we're covering huge issues all the time but Nikki Haley coming out and laying out what we already knew when we first broke that's been confirmed by many others is just incredible because it gives us the blueprint on how to defeat these people and I'll explain that
[01:03:31.195 --> 01:03:37.882]  As quickly and as focused as I can, you've got my commitment on the other side of this break to do it.
[01:03:37.882 --> 01:03:42.567]  I'm begging you for yourself and your family's future.
[01:03:42.567 --> 01:03:53.037]  And for the commitment of this broadcast that I want to defeat these people, to please, please remember that it is only your word of mouth that gets us around the censors.
[01:03:54.147 --> 01:04:03.009]  And it is only your financial support that funds the operation and only your prayer that I know if two of us agree upon it on earth, it's done in heaven.
[01:04:03.009 --> 01:04:18.312]  That it is your intercession that is literally giving us discernment and it's not luck, it's a man's heart chooses his path, but God guideth our steps.
[01:04:18.312 --> 01:04:20.933]  To quote a verse, I forget the verse, but
[01:04:21.912 --> 01:04:22.372]  That's it.
[01:04:22.372 --> 01:04:23.692]  And I need that.
[01:04:23.692 --> 01:04:25.213]  I need that.
[01:04:25.213 --> 01:04:27.133]  I absolutely need that.
[01:04:27.133 --> 01:04:27.853]  And I feel it.
[01:04:27.853 --> 01:04:28.334]  I see it.
[01:04:28.334 --> 01:04:30.374]  And I'm humble and I can handle it.
[01:04:30.374 --> 01:04:31.334]  I need more prayer.
[01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:32.095]  It's unbelievable.
[01:04:32.095 --> 01:04:35.315]  I mean, you are just burning a pathway for me right now.
[01:04:35.315 --> 01:04:39.616]  You are literally, as we're just going through solid rock at the end of me, a millisecond ahead of us, you're just burning.
[01:04:39.616 --> 01:04:43.517]  And we're moving a million miles an hour, and if you don't keep it going, we'll slam into it.
[01:04:43.517 --> 01:04:46.058]  You keep it going, we're just burning the hole into the enemy.
[01:04:46.058 --> 01:04:49.799]  Just blasting through them right now, like a high-powered trajectory rifle round.
[01:04:50.459 --> 01:04:52.780]  I need your prayers more than anything!
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:57.422]  Please pray for us!
[01:04:57.422 --> 01:04:59.603]  All of our bodies are different.
[01:04:59.603 --> 01:05:02.405]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[01:05:02.405 --> 01:05:05.406]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[01:05:05.406 --> 01:05:10.188]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something you don't know.
[01:05:10.188 --> 01:05:11.089]  But I'm here to tell you.
[01:05:12.165 --> 01:05:21.248]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life completely changes.
[01:05:21.248 --> 01:05:21.988]  I'm healthier.
[01:05:21.988 --> 01:05:23.349]  I have more energy.
[01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:24.169]  I lose weight.
[01:05:24.169 --> 01:05:24.949]  I look better.
[01:05:24.949 --> 01:05:26.510]  Everybody notices.
[01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:33.032]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2, Body's Ultimate Turmeric,
[01:05:33.812 --> 01:05:38.855]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the Gut Fusion from InfoWars Life.
[01:05:38.855 --> 01:05:43.779]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[01:05:43.779 --> 01:05:49.162]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about, is Gut Fusion.
[01:05:49.162 --> 01:05:50.283]  Folks, check it out.
[01:05:50.283 --> 01:05:51.824]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:53.185]  50% off right now.
[01:05:53.185 --> 01:05:54.746]  The sale's about to end.
[01:05:54.746 --> 01:05:55.426]  Gut Fusion.
[01:05:55.426 --> 01:05:56.327]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:04.344 --> 01:06:17.028]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:17.028 --> 01:06:20.129]  It is Monday, November 11th, 2019.
[01:06:20.129 --> 01:06:24.931]  Your phone calls to balance the transmission coming up.
[01:06:24.931 --> 01:06:25.911]  Let's get right to it.
[01:06:26.952 --> 01:06:39.516]  Nikki Haley has come out confirming what we first broke more than two years ago from inside White House sources and patriots inside the State Department, CIA, and the Department of Defense.
[01:06:39.516 --> 01:06:44.418]  Nikki Haley reveals attempted sabotage against America and President Trump.
[01:06:44.418 --> 01:06:50.020]  Attempts to derail Trump and subvert the 2016 election is 100% textbook treason.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:52.301]  And Nikki Haley has now come out
[01:06:52.981 --> 01:07:01.467]  Ladies and gentlemen, and expose the facts that Rex Tillerson and John Kelly were saying, oh, save America.
[01:07:01.467 --> 01:07:02.688]  Don't do what he says.
[01:07:02.688 --> 01:07:03.809]  He'd sign executive orders.
[01:07:03.809 --> 01:07:05.531]  They'd literally shred them.
[01:07:05.531 --> 01:07:07.412]  That is a federal crime.
[01:07:07.412 --> 01:07:09.153]  Obstruction.
[01:07:09.153 --> 01:07:10.855]  It is just fraud.
[01:07:10.855 --> 01:07:18.380]  But Kelly says, hey, if giving him the best advice of the government is bad, then I'm guilty.
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.602]  No, you obstructed the president.
[01:07:22.517 --> 01:07:35.462]  But again, these are yes-men from the establishment told what geniuses they are and how Trump's this buffoon by this deep state that's hijacked our country and literally has run the nation into the ground.
[01:07:35.462 --> 01:07:40.745]  So you guys must be really pathetic if Trump and Infowars run circles around you and that's really the solution here.
[01:07:40.745 --> 01:07:46.207]  Because these guys think they're so incredible as white shoe boys and so invincible.
[01:07:46.207 --> 01:07:49.628]  Why are they so worried about Infowars?
[01:07:49.628 --> 01:07:50.869]  Why are they so worried about Trump?
[01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:57.373]  You see, the truth is they've sold out the shycoms and others.
[01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:00.556]  Pretty easy to run the country and run in the ground and sell it off.
[01:08:00.556 --> 01:08:01.857]  We're fighting back against you.
[01:08:01.857 --> 01:08:03.558]  We're not a bunch of yes-men.
[01:08:03.558 --> 01:08:12.727]  And neither is Congressman Scalise, or Congressman Jordan, or Congressman Nunes, or some of the best senators that are up there.
[01:08:12.727 --> 01:08:14.769]  Like the senator from Missouri.
[01:08:14.769 --> 01:08:16.090]  Hurley Turley.
[01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:17.652]  All those guys are fighting hard.
[01:08:20.421 --> 01:08:28.229]  So let's go ahead and go to Nikki Haley laying out this incredible piece of the puzzle.
[01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:35.536]  And then the Secretary of State Tillerson went on to tell you the reason he resisted the President's decisions was because if he didn't, people would die.
[01:08:37.691 --> 01:08:39.513]  Do you memorialize that conversation?
[01:08:39.513 --> 01:08:40.674]  It definitely happened?
[01:08:40.674 --> 01:08:42.556]  It absolutely happened.
[01:08:42.556 --> 01:08:47.120]  And instead of saying that to me, they should have been saying that to the president.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.405]  Not asking me to join them on their sidebar plan.
[01:08:51.405 --> 01:08:56.610]  It should have been, go tell the president what your differences are and quit if you don't like what he's doing.
[01:08:56.610 --> 01:08:58.392]  But to undermine a president.
[01:08:59.517 --> 01:09:06.559]  is really a very dangerous thing and it goes against the Constitution and it goes against what the American people want.
[01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:08.919]  It was offensive.
[01:09:08.919 --> 01:09:11.119]  We asked them to respond.
[01:09:11.119 --> 01:09:27.923]  John Kelly tells Sunday Morning, if by resistance and stalling she means putting a staff process in place to ensure the president knew all the pros and cons of what policy decision he might be contemplating so he could make an informed decision, then guilty as charged.
[01:09:30.336 --> 01:09:32.417]  So there you go.
[01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:41.761]  No, what they did was go around and try to organize a cabal against the president in the name of saving America, never actually, again, confronting him.
[01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.502]  And then look at the policies they wanted.
[01:09:43.502 --> 01:09:52.606]  Endless war, deindustrialization, open borders, the UN, running our refugee program and saying who could come into the country, not the president.
[01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:53.846]  He reversed that.
[01:09:53.846 --> 01:09:55.167]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:07.043]  And now they said, oh, we'll just crash the economy and raise interest rates eight times to start that process.
[01:10:07.043 --> 01:10:08.564]  These people are our mortal enemies.
[01:10:08.564 --> 01:10:12.206]  We don't need friends like them.
[01:10:12.206 --> 01:10:17.529]  Remember, just because Kelly wore a uniform, so did Benedict Arnold.
[01:10:17.529 --> 01:10:18.610]  Think about that.
[01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:19.771]  These are globalists.
[01:10:19.771 --> 01:10:20.951]  These are yes-men.
[01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:22.272]  They got put in positions of power.
[01:10:22.272 --> 01:10:23.613]  Anybody in the military will tell you.
[01:10:23.613 --> 01:10:27.215]  Somebody gets to general level now, it means they've sold people out.
[01:10:27.215 --> 01:10:28.356]  It means they'll do what they're told.
[01:10:29.192 --> 01:10:33.034]  The military is now a social engineering brainwashing facility.
[01:10:33.034 --> 01:10:40.017]  They're replacing the troops with robots.
[01:10:40.017 --> 01:10:54.284]  Now, here's Roger Stone in 2017, and we've got another clip of him just a year and a half ago, breaking down John Kelly, and how they were working with Steve Bannon to bring in the Deep State, and all these sorrows.
[01:10:54.284 --> 01:10:56.025]  People like Fiona Hill and Eric.
[01:10:58.467 --> 01:11:00.889]  Sierra Mela.
[01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:02.451]  What does Bannon do?
[01:11:02.451 --> 01:11:19.466]  He leaves in August and by October he has a financial deal with Kwok to finance Breitbart as the Mercers, who I do think are patriots, appear to be ready to throw in line.
[01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:35.702]  Trump a traitor, at the same time talking to a snake reporter that he brought into the hen house, and at the same time using national security intel to then go basically get money off of somebody so that he could be the person's political protector.
[01:11:35.702 --> 01:11:41.969]  By every stretch of the imagination, by every historical yardstick, this sounds like treason to me.
[01:11:43.356 --> 01:11:46.259]  And then that's a particular clip dealing with Bannon.
[01:11:46.259 --> 01:11:50.202]  The clips we have, you can just type into Google if you want.
[01:11:50.202 --> 01:11:54.026]  Roger Stone says Kelly's on his way out.
[01:11:54.026 --> 01:11:58.190]  Roger Stone says that Kelly has brought in sorrow sites.
[01:11:58.190 --> 01:11:59.451]  Those are the clips I sent the crew.
[01:11:59.451 --> 01:12:02.154]  We'll play those for you a little bit later.
[01:12:02.154 --> 01:12:08.480]  But continuing here now, ladies and gentlemen, we have the New York Times coming out.
[01:12:09.833 --> 01:12:13.600]  Saying they're getting ready to publish this anonymous book.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:19.931]  The word is it's John Bolton who we know wants to testify against the president.
[01:12:22.617 --> 01:12:26.658]  Even though there's a separation of powers, the President, by law, is supposed to be able to keep him from doing it.
[01:12:26.658 --> 01:12:37.642]  He wants to go bear the false witness because he's a neocon, was always a neocon, but lied to Trump's face that he would try to carry out the President's agenda, the person that we elected.
[01:12:37.642 --> 01:12:39.262]  Book Review is a warning.
[01:12:39.262 --> 01:12:43.104]  Anonymous author makes case against re-election.
[01:12:43.104 --> 01:12:49.086]  And Steve Pchenik, who's worked with a lot of these people, says that John Bolton is today's Benedict Arnold.
[01:12:49.086 --> 01:12:50.326]  Here he is from his YouTube channel.
[01:12:53.905 --> 01:13:00.568]  Hi, this is Dr. Pichenik, and today I want to talk about John Bolton, the Benedict Arnold of America.
[01:13:00.568 --> 01:13:02.729]  Now, why do I say that?
[01:13:02.729 --> 01:13:13.553]  A book came out that was written by anonymous, and it's written about the Trump administration and how childish they are, how puerile, and how ineffective they are.
[01:13:13.553 --> 01:13:19.636]  In fact, John Bolton calls the president a 12-year-old but doesn't know what his mental condition is.
[01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:23.677]  I happen to know John Bolton, and I think he's a sociopath.
[01:13:23.677 --> 01:13:28.159]  But as an intelligence operative, what I did was to create agitation propaganda.
[01:13:28.159 --> 01:13:42.646]  I purposely created a proposal for my own book, which will come out in a few weeks, which talks about the real Jack Ryan and the person who really implemented a lot of the coups and counter-coups in this administration.
[01:13:42.646 --> 01:13:44.707]  Now I'm doing another coup.
[01:13:44.707 --> 01:13:49.269]  What I'm trying to do is to get John Bolton blown out of the water because he
[01:13:50.389 --> 01:13:50.730]  I think?
[01:14:13.969 --> 01:14:15.770]  Deeply involved in 9-11.
[01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:31.774]  When I wrote my proposal and presented it to Hachette, and I'll talk about Hachette in a minute, they turned me down immediately because they knew that the history of the real Jack Ryan was involved in breaking up the 9-11 coup.
[01:14:31.774 --> 01:14:34.755]  Now let me say to you how this came about.
[01:14:34.755 --> 01:14:40.057]  John Bolton's figure and personality fits what we call in the intelligence world mice.
[01:14:41.077 --> 01:14:48.944]  M standing for money, I for ideology, C for compromise, and E for ego.
[01:14:48.944 --> 01:14:50.605]  John needs the money.
[01:14:50.605 --> 01:14:53.808]  He's ideologically always been a neocon.
[01:14:53.808 --> 01:15:02.795]  C, he's always been compromised by someone or an institution, in this case Yale, where he went to Yale and worked with Bob Woodward.
[01:15:03.175 --> 01:15:07.460]  And John Kerry, who are now on ABC News and NBC News.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.522]  And the last one was ego.
[01:15:09.522 --> 01:15:11.544]  His ego is immense.
[01:15:11.544 --> 01:15:22.155]  Carl Ford, one of my intelligence operatives, said correctly that John needed to always suck up to the superior and always deprecate the bottom.
[01:15:22.896 --> 01:15:28.222]  Ladies and gentlemen, the CIA is a rogue agency out of control run by foreign banks.
[01:15:28.222 --> 01:15:31.065]  It's against America, and it's trying to run it in the ground.
[01:15:31.065 --> 01:15:36.010]  We're going to take your phone calls coming up, and I am going to get you those clips when Roger Stone was on this show.
[01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:36.551]  You all heard it.
[01:15:36.551 --> 01:15:38.753]  We've got 50 articles on the websites, literally.
[01:15:38.753 --> 01:15:40.054]  Just type it in.
[01:15:40.054 --> 01:15:40.895]  I'll pull it up for you.
[01:15:41.696 --> 01:15:48.148]  Where Roger Stone exposes John Kelly working with Deep State against Trump and that he would soon be resigning.
[01:15:48.148 --> 01:15:51.555]  We've got all those for you coming up in your phone calls.
[01:15:51.555 --> 01:15:52.937]  Infowars.com.
[01:15:52.937 --> 01:15:53.979]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:15:56.331 --> 01:15:59.374]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[01:15:59.374 --> 01:16:02.278]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:06.620]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:14.346]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[01:17:14.346 --> 01:17:22.232]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[01:17:22.392 --> 01:17:24.173]  Not a security IPO or note.
[01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:33.696]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[01:17:33.696 --> 01:17:34.537]  Don't miss this one.

[01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:38.998]  800-600-3388.
[01:17:53.685 --> 01:18:01.489]  The time has come to defy the Thought Police.
[01:18:01.489 --> 01:18:04.971]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:15.297]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[01:18:15.297 --> 01:18:17.678]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[01:18:18.258 --> 01:18:24.704]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[01:18:24.704 --> 01:18:31.770]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[01:18:31.770 --> 01:18:34.313]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[01:18:34.953 --> 01:18:39.198]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[01:18:39.198 --> 01:18:43.122]  We have a It's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap.
[01:18:43.122 --> 01:18:43.983]  It's black and white.
[01:18:43.983 --> 01:18:44.464]  Very nice.
[01:18:44.464 --> 01:18:45.945]  It has the OK symbol on it.
[01:18:45.945 --> 01:18:47.767]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[01:18:47.767 --> 01:18:49.769]  Infowars.com is on the back.
[01:18:49.769 --> 01:18:55.736]  Get yours today at infowarsstore.com and support free speech by supporting InfoWars while having a great hat.
[01:18:58.270 --> 01:19:01.952]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[01:19:01.952 --> 01:19:09.936]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[01:19:09.936 --> 01:19:12.517]  It's just that simple.
[01:19:12.517 --> 01:19:18.921]  X3 is the deep-earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:19.441]  Others like
[01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:22.122]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[01:19:22.122 --> 01:19:22.843]  Get both.
[01:19:22.843 --> 01:19:24.304]  They're both great for you.
[01:19:24.304 --> 01:19:28.726]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[01:19:28.726 --> 01:19:30.927]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[01:19:30.927 --> 01:19:32.268]  That's why I harp on it.
[01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:36.450]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[01:19:36.450 --> 01:19:38.612]  Lower IQ makes you sluggish.
[01:19:38.612 --> 01:19:39.692]  You don't live as long.
[01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:40.453]  It's simple.
[01:19:40.453 --> 01:19:44.675]  Get your high-quality iodine at InfoWarsTore.com and help fund the InfoWar.
[01:19:45.035 --> 01:19:47.158]  InfowarStore.com.
[01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:49.841]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[01:19:49.841 --> 01:19:51.663]  It's the Iodine Challenge.
[01:19:51.663 --> 01:20:00.513]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[01:20:00.513 --> 01:20:03.156]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:23.974]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:23.974 --> 01:20:27.536]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls right now.
[01:20:27.536 --> 01:20:38.500]  We know that Rex Tillerson and John Kelly, working with the Deep State, helped bring in people like John Bolton, McMaster, the Robin Fiona Hill, all of them.
[01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:39.461]  We've exposed them at the time.
[01:20:41.192 --> 01:20:59.298]  These guys are part of butt-sniffing, white-shoe boy establishment types who get into power because they go to these committees of the globalists, of the establishment, and make sure that all the lawyers and everyone signs off on what they do, and then they just organize the sell-off of the country.
[01:20:59.298 --> 01:21:00.478]  And now they're pissed.
[01:21:00.478 --> 01:21:10.161]  We elected a president that actually thinks he's running the country, and they're trying to cause a depression and a civil war to get him out and finally defeat their enemy, the American people.
[01:21:11.616 --> 01:21:14.898]  And just because people think, oh, Kelly was in the Marine Corps.
[01:21:14.898 --> 01:21:20.742]  Yeah, well, Benedict Arnold was the most decorated general after George Washington, and he was a British double agent.
[01:21:20.742 --> 01:21:25.885]  These guys like to play both sides of the fence.
[01:21:25.885 --> 01:21:28.486]  They think it's smart.
[01:21:28.486 --> 01:21:32.549]  That way they always just go up, up, up, up, up as the country and the world goes down, down, down.
[01:21:33.376 --> 01:21:36.297]  But I told you if you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[01:21:36.297 --> 01:21:38.218]  Whistleblower in Texas.
[01:21:38.218 --> 01:21:40.199]  That's like a royal title.
[01:21:40.199 --> 01:21:40.699]  Almost.
[01:21:40.699 --> 01:21:41.339]  Whistleblower.
[01:21:41.339 --> 01:21:42.340]  It's like dossier.
[01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:48.362]  I better keep your anonymity secret, but those being accused are publicly on trial.
[01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:50.363]  The whistleblower says that maybe I'm a pumpkin.
[01:21:50.363 --> 01:21:51.083]  I'll turn into one.
[01:21:51.083 --> 01:21:52.764]  It's a magical thing.
[01:21:52.764 --> 01:21:55.285]  Whistleblower in Texas disagrees.
[01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:56.665]  Says Trump should resign.
[01:21:56.665 --> 01:21:57.106]  Tell us.
[01:21:57.106 --> 01:21:58.986]  Tell us.
[01:21:58.986 --> 01:22:01.527]  Well, Trump's next move is resignation.
[01:22:01.527 --> 01:22:02.648]  You know how he's got the
[01:22:04.093 --> 01:22:04.733]  I don't know.
[01:22:23.074 --> 01:22:27.736]  Uh, who knows how long it's going to take, but that, that's the dominoes that are falling.
[01:22:27.736 --> 01:22:32.178]  Well, you sound like you have satisfaction, like you're powerful.
[01:22:32.178 --> 01:22:34.759]  And if this happens, it's like a victory for you.
[01:22:34.759 --> 01:22:36.880]  Is that what you think?
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:52.047]  No, I think, um, uh, I think it's just, uh, hopefully the, the way that I've read it, uh, I don't, I don't revel in, uh, I don't revel in our country having gone through such a terrible, uh, crisis, but, um,
[01:22:52.646 --> 01:22:57.427]  I see this as being the result, you know, the end result.
[01:22:57.427 --> 01:23:01.248]  Like him trying to control the totally open border and the UN flooding us on purpose?
[01:23:01.248 --> 01:23:05.870]  Or him getting out of the TPP that Hillary secretly wrote that's one-sided trade deals?
[01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:11.011]  I mean, just the terrible crisis of having a president actually try to be president?
[01:23:11.011 --> 01:23:15.212]  No, I think it's a person that didn't intend to be president in the first place.
[01:23:17.475 --> 01:23:20.156]  He was just running a PR campaign so he could do The Apprentice 4.
[01:23:20.156 --> 01:23:21.736]  He's going to do that!
[01:23:21.736 --> 01:23:22.096]  Really?
[01:23:22.096 --> 01:23:26.477]  What does that say about the big establishment in Hillary that didn't see it coming?
[01:23:26.477 --> 01:23:28.577]  There isn't one!
[01:23:28.577 --> 01:23:31.358]  That's what it says.
[01:23:31.358 --> 01:23:32.698]  It says there isn't one.
[01:23:32.698 --> 01:23:35.618]  It says that that's a fantasy.
[01:23:35.618 --> 01:23:43.040]  Oh, you're with an older download of propaganda where globalism doesn't exist, the deep state doesn't exist.
[01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:45.531]  Hold on just a second.
[01:23:45.531 --> 01:23:48.252]  There's no anti-Christian or anti-Christmas movement.
[01:23:48.252 --> 01:23:50.873]  There's no anti-Thanksgiving movement.
[01:23:50.873 --> 01:23:51.674]  It's all over the news.
[01:23:51.674 --> 01:23:54.655]  There's no attempt to sexualize children.
[01:23:54.655 --> 01:24:00.398]  What you're saying is, oh, so there's no permanent establishment in D.C.
[01:24:00.398 --> 01:24:01.258]  I mean, there is one.
[01:24:01.258 --> 01:24:05.901]  They're a bunch of idiots who all tell each other how great they are and they're getting their ass kicked.
[01:24:05.901 --> 01:24:06.381]  Yeah.
[01:24:06.381 --> 01:24:07.901]  Yeah, there's that.
[01:24:07.901 --> 01:24:08.482]  And then there's...
[01:24:09.693 --> 01:24:11.434]  And then there's just real people.
[01:24:11.434 --> 01:24:17.237]  You know, this global cabal, whatnot, is all fantasy, balderdash, whatever.
[01:24:17.237 --> 01:24:31.846]  So wait a minute, when Xi Jinping almost three years ago, in early 2017, right after Trump was inaugurated, when he went to Davos and said, our global government will continue, communist China will empower it,
[01:24:32.746 --> 01:24:35.327]  Uh, you know, David Rockefeller, you know, helped us.
[01:24:35.327 --> 01:24:37.287]  We will help you defeat Trump.
[01:24:37.287 --> 01:24:47.770]  And whenever Juncker, the literal heir of the Nazi fortune, whose grandfather ran Nazi Germany with Hitler, said, we'll stop the Americans, we'll teach them, we'll teach the Brits not to leave.
[01:24:47.770 --> 01:24:49.910]  None of that was real.
[01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:53.011]  Oh, so I, I don't know what you're referencing.
[01:24:53.011 --> 01:24:57.192]  So, um, well, you're saying there's no global government, there's no deep state.
[01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:59.733]  There's just, there's none of that.
[01:24:59.733 --> 01:25:00.593]  Yeah.
[01:25:00.593 --> 01:25:00.753]  Yeah.
[01:25:02.176 --> 01:25:10.840]  And I think I just want to say thanks for playing that drop from A Face in the Crowd last week.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:11.721]  The Andy Griffith movie?
[01:25:11.721 --> 01:25:13.682]  Yes.
[01:25:13.682 --> 01:25:17.043]  That was a wild ride.
[01:25:17.043 --> 01:25:17.944]  Quite enjoyable.
[01:25:17.944 --> 01:25:20.965]  Recommend it to anyone who's got Amazon Prime.
[01:25:20.965 --> 01:25:24.167]  Zero dollar rental.
[01:25:24.167 --> 01:25:24.727]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:25:24.727 --> 01:25:26.368]  That was an awesome movie.
[01:25:26.368 --> 01:25:27.128]  Yeah, you bet.
[01:25:27.128 --> 01:25:28.909]  In fact, since you bring it up, we'll play it.
[01:25:30.183 --> 01:25:44.517]  After the next break for TV and radio listeners, but sir, what I'm telling you is there is a global corporate governance system that is screwing over everyone and is tax exempt.
[01:25:45.618 --> 01:25:56.583]  And then Trump gets in and actually sees America getting one-sided trade deals and just wants to get a better deal for the country and exercise real American power instead of selling out American power.
[01:25:56.583 --> 01:26:05.407]  And then you make childish statements about how there's no global government, there's no deep state, when it's in all their emails, it's in the WikiLeaks, it's these corrupt groups.
[01:26:05.407 --> 01:26:07.228]  They are incompetent.
[01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:10.129]  They are a bunch of skin-bred scum.
[01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:13.871]  And Trump's right on Friday when he said, we're kicking their ass.
[01:26:13.871 --> 01:26:14.711]  Did you see that video?
[01:26:16.333 --> 01:26:17.715]  I've read the headline.
[01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:18.575]  Sure.
[01:26:18.575 --> 01:26:19.276]  Sure.
[01:26:19.276 --> 01:26:22.499]  Would you like me to play that clip for you, too?
[01:26:22.499 --> 01:26:23.980]  You can play anything you want.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:25.982]  My phone's about to die.
[01:26:25.982 --> 01:26:38.974]  I know, but there's this arrogance of people that think they're part of the establishment, who say there isn't an establishment, so that we can never get to square one about saying, hey, let's have the rule of law and a pro-American future govern our nation.
[01:26:40.117 --> 01:26:46.182]  And let's get all these special interests out that think they own and run the country and have done one-sided deals to China and others.
[01:26:46.182 --> 01:26:47.403]  I mean, that's a fact.
[01:26:47.403 --> 01:26:48.804]  It's a fact China owns our debt.
[01:26:48.804 --> 01:26:52.868]  It's a fact China owns most of Hollywood and controls all these movies.
[01:26:52.868 --> 01:26:53.848]  And I don't like that.
[01:26:53.848 --> 01:26:56.030]  We don't control their movies.
[01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:59.753]  And, I mean, are you saying the Chi-Coms aren't trying to run our country?
[01:26:59.753 --> 01:27:03.516]  We control everyone's movies because we have Hollywood.
[01:27:03.516 --> 01:27:08.000]  No, if you buy up Hollywood, then America doesn't control it.
[01:27:09.233 --> 01:27:10.914]  And what is America?
[01:27:10.914 --> 01:27:17.096]  Hollywood is a bunch of America haters that tell us the country was never great and will never be great.
[01:27:17.096 --> 01:27:18.817]  This is the greatest country on the fucking planet.
[01:27:18.817 --> 01:27:20.137]  Alright, you just cussed.
[01:27:20.137 --> 01:27:23.018]  I gotta let you go.
[01:27:23.018 --> 01:27:32.122]  There's a lot of people that buy into hating Trump because they get to bitch about it at work and they get to talk about it and whine about it and have some fake solidarity.
[01:27:32.122 --> 01:27:37.544]  But these are all followers and they're all people that wouldn't help you out in a jam.
[01:27:39.670 --> 01:27:42.152]  They're all sunshine patriots, folks.
[01:27:42.152 --> 01:27:44.153]  They're not winter soldiers.
[01:27:44.153 --> 01:27:48.516]  And Trump's a winter soldier, and he's done a really kick-ass job.
[01:27:48.516 --> 01:27:54.341]  And everybody's being put under massive pressure to turn their back on him, just like they've been put under pressure to turn their back on us.
[01:27:54.701 --> 01:28:00.803]  And they're being told, oh, as soon as he's gone, all the problems will be gone and all the infighting will be gone.
[01:28:00.803 --> 01:28:07.226]  The people creating the infighting and the racial division and the attack on our children are the ones that were already doing it.
[01:28:07.226 --> 01:28:10.747]  They just accelerated their program when President Trump got into office.
[01:28:12.642 --> 01:28:20.327]  And now they're the ones trying to crash the economy, in the words of Bill Maher, to teach Americans not to support nationalism.
[01:28:20.327 --> 01:28:23.789]  They're the ones that tell us nationalism's dirty and nationalism's bad.
[01:28:23.789 --> 01:28:31.735]  And all you fools that happen to be tuning in on our regular listeners, but the people that really think you're betting on the winning team.
[01:28:31.735 --> 01:28:33.235]  I told you Trump was going to win.
[01:28:33.235 --> 01:28:34.396]  He did.
[01:28:34.396 --> 01:28:35.857]  I told you globalism's in trouble.
[01:28:35.857 --> 01:28:36.778]  You can see it.
[01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:38.259]  It's back on its heels.
[01:28:38.259 --> 01:28:41.481]  And even if you remove Trump, which there's a 50-50 chance, I think,
[01:28:42.824 --> 01:28:46.432]  Stopped during this cycle when he, in his second turn.
[01:28:46.432 --> 01:28:48.617]  That is an even bigger defeat for you.
[01:28:48.617 --> 01:28:52.685]  You watch, and all the censorship that's happened to shut us up.
[01:28:52.685 --> 01:28:53.587]  It ain't working!
[01:28:56.485 --> 01:29:01.568]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:04.983]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[01:30:04.983 --> 01:30:15.294]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[01:30:15.294 --> 01:30:17.717]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[01:30:18.257 --> 01:30:24.706]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[01:30:24.706 --> 01:30:31.775]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[01:30:31.775 --> 01:30:34.319]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[01:30:34.939 --> 01:30:39.202]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[01:30:39.202 --> 01:30:43.104]  We have a it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap.
[01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:43.965]  It's black and white.
[01:30:43.965 --> 01:30:44.465]  Very nice.
[01:30:44.465 --> 01:30:45.946]  It has the okay symbol on it.
[01:30:45.946 --> 01:30:47.767]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[01:30:47.767 --> 01:30:49.768]  Infowars.com is on the back.

[01:30:58.454 --> 01:31:13.710]  The rich queen of the deep state lost the 2016 election because she was arrogant and the corporate whores in the media busily covering up her giant pedophile and blackmail rings thought that her victory was assured.
[01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:14.511]  Now that the
[01:31:14.611 --> 01:31:16.292]  The enemy lost that election.
[01:31:16.292 --> 01:31:20.353]  They are awake and throwing everything they've got at us.
[01:31:20.353 --> 01:31:25.875]  And conservatives and nationalists and Christians and patriots, many of them, are asleep thinking 2020's in the bag.
[01:31:25.875 --> 01:31:28.456]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost Kentucky governorship.
[01:31:28.456 --> 01:31:31.977]  We just lost the Virginia Statehouse the first time in 30 years.
[01:31:31.977 --> 01:31:33.538]  This is serious.
[01:31:33.538 --> 01:31:37.159]  We can win again and secure the gains we've gotten.
[01:31:37.159 --> 01:31:39.060]  Or we can see it all wash down the drain.
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:47.345]  Whatever you do, get more politically activated than you ever have, and spread the live links at man.video and infowars.com forward slash show.

[01:33:22.246 --> 01:33:23.607]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.212 --> 01:33:48.544]  Alright, the smarmy, arrogant anti-Trumper that you just heard wanted to see this little piece we put together dealing with how the mainstream corporate media really thinks about you with edits from the face in a crowd.
[01:33:48.544 --> 01:33:53.508]  Then we're going to come back with your phone calls here in just a moment, but here it is.
[01:33:57.321 --> 01:33:58.902]  I'm not just an entertainer.
[01:33:58.902 --> 01:34:02.103]  I'm an influence, a wielder of opinion, a force!
[01:34:02.103 --> 01:34:11.707]  Do you have any people paid by the CIA who are working for television networks?
[01:34:11.707 --> 01:34:17.189]  I think we're getting into the kind of detail, Mr. Chairman, that I'd prefer to handle in executive session.
[01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:18.810]  This is CNN.
[01:34:20.745 --> 01:34:23.808]  Are those morons out there?
[01:34:23.808 --> 01:34:27.611]  Sure, I got them like this.
[01:34:27.611 --> 01:34:29.432]  You know what the public's like.
[01:34:29.432 --> 01:34:32.695]  A cage full of guinea pigs.
[01:34:32.695 --> 01:34:34.477]  Boy, do I almost look stupid.
[01:34:34.477 --> 01:34:39.041]  Good night, you stupid idiots.
[01:34:39.041 --> 01:34:42.824]  Good night, you miserable slobs.
[01:34:44.702 --> 01:34:47.163]  There are a lot of trained seals.
[01:34:47.163 --> 01:34:52.066]  I toss them a dead fish and they'll flap their flippers.
[01:34:52.066 --> 01:34:55.228]  Oh, if they ever heard the way that psycho really talks.
[01:34:55.228 --> 01:35:06.494]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call, stop the hammering!
[01:35:06.494 --> 01:35:13.878]  Our great Darren McBrain put that little masterpiece together, but when I told him to put a compilation together, I got busy, never told him what I wanted.
[01:35:15.675 --> 01:35:22.558]  I want a bigger piece done with that, with Jonathan Gruber saying, thank God they're so dumb, thank God they don't have any attention spans.
[01:35:22.558 --> 01:35:30.321]  Joy Behar is what made me think of it, where she goes, look, you don't tell them we're going to take all their guns from the stupid flyover gun for the Christians.
[01:35:30.321 --> 01:35:40.025]  And then Obama saying, yeah, the bitter clingers, I'm not going to let them know I'm going to take their guns and their Bibles and their kids, he didn't say that part, until I get in.
[01:35:42.176 --> 01:35:48.480]  But we're going to put a big, because I want to do a big review of Facing the Crowd.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:59.006]  And notice, they point that film, because they're leftist Hollywood scum, at Roy Rogers, who was a populist that they couldn't get the people to hate.
[01:35:59.006 --> 01:36:06.290]  So that movie was against Roy Rogers, after he was gone and dead.
[01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:07.351]  Or Will Rogers.
[01:36:07.351 --> 01:36:08.972]  Again, I'm teleprompter-free, folks.
[01:36:10.205 --> 01:36:17.211]  So, that's how they operate, and I don't feel good imagining conning people.
[01:36:17.211 --> 01:36:21.896]  I don't get a good little spring in my step calling in like that last caller.
[01:36:21.896 --> 01:36:22.976]  No wonder he likes that movie.
[01:36:22.976 --> 01:36:25.058]  I guess it's about him, he thinks.
[01:36:25.058 --> 01:36:27.741]  Going, when I read this, he'll be gone real quick.
[01:36:27.741 --> 01:36:32.985]  He's already running down there to Florida, shutting his lizard butt in the sun.
[01:36:35.484 --> 01:36:41.967]  The satisfaction that that guy has, like he's part of the establishment, is sickening, isn't it?
[01:36:41.967 --> 01:36:47.229]  I mean, you heard it for yourself.
[01:36:47.229 --> 01:36:50.491]  Meanwhile, our children are being sexualized.
[01:36:50.491 --> 01:36:52.792]  They're killing babies after they're born.
[01:36:52.792 --> 01:36:57.694]  5G's going in that gives people cancer on record.
[01:36:57.694 --> 01:36:59.635]  The society's falling apart.
[01:36:59.635 --> 01:37:04.037]  All these federal judges are trying to block Trump, but he wins every Supreme Court case he's gotten.
[01:37:04.898 --> 01:37:07.982]  I'd love to overturn the Constitution.
[01:37:07.982 --> 01:37:10.125]  And this guy's like, our nation will be alright.
[01:37:10.125 --> 01:37:11.426]  He'll be gone soon.
[01:37:11.426 --> 01:37:13.169]  Our nation will be alright?
[01:37:13.169 --> 01:37:21.680]  When Trump says we should love our nation and it's good to have countries, CNN and MSNBC says that's racist, that a country existing is bad.
[01:37:25.623 --> 01:37:41.072]  But you hear the conceit from people that think they're part of the establishment when 99.99% of people that go along with globalism are screwing their own future.
[01:37:41.072 --> 01:37:41.972]  But they don't care.
[01:37:41.972 --> 01:37:48.216]  These are the people that tune into Bill Maher and feel like he's their buddy.
[01:37:48.216 --> 01:37:52.018]  I've noticed the ratio of people that are for the establishment is how much television they watch.
[01:37:54.062 --> 01:37:57.923]  I mean, and also the bigger the losers they are.
[01:37:57.923 --> 01:38:03.805]  They're either on welfare or they've got three degrees that are worthless.
[01:38:03.805 --> 01:38:07.266]  They can't even make a living, but they get to mentor young people.
[01:38:07.266 --> 01:38:08.487]  That means brainwash them.
[01:38:08.487 --> 01:38:15.029]  So the currency they want is having people in their cult, but they don't even get any power out of that either.
[01:38:16.018 --> 01:38:20.341]  You get power out of empowering people, then the rising tide raises you.
[01:38:20.341 --> 01:38:22.203]  Globalism doesn't empower people.
[01:38:22.203 --> 01:38:24.204]  It's a post-human system.
[01:38:24.204 --> 01:38:26.366]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:38:26.366 --> 01:38:30.088]  I said I'd go quickly, but that one caller got a whole segment.
[01:38:30.088 --> 01:38:36.193]  But since I mentioned it, here's Trump, because he is kicking the deep state's ass.
[01:38:36.193 --> 01:38:42.558]  Everything is proven to be a lie, but like shark teeth, one group of lies falls out, another rolls forward.
[01:38:43.732 --> 01:38:45.757]  You don't kill a shark by pulling its teeth out.
[01:38:45.757 --> 01:38:48.925]  You kill a shark by putting a bullet through its brain.
[01:38:48.925 --> 01:38:50.208]  And I'm not calling for violence.
[01:38:50.208 --> 01:38:51.792]  I mean that as a metaphor.
[01:38:51.792 --> 01:38:53.235]  Just like I don't want to pull a shark's teeth out.
[01:38:55.649 --> 01:38:57.990]  And we have to expose their ideology.
[01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:59.190]  That's what they say.
[01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:00.531]  You heard that caller.
[01:39:00.531 --> 01:39:02.872]  Oh, there's no globalism, there's no deep state.
[01:39:02.872 --> 01:39:05.973]  They're trying to go back to the old propaganda.
[01:39:05.973 --> 01:39:15.817]  They don't want you awake, knowing it's special interest from outside, screwing you over, selling you out, demoralizing you on the way, so you never get back control of your country.
[01:39:15.817 --> 01:39:18.058]  And find out what they've done, and the election fraud.
[01:39:18.058 --> 01:39:20.439]  Let me tell you how it works, since that fella called in.
[01:39:21.823 --> 01:39:38.808]  This Kentucky fraud, the thousands of pages, the proof of one company in dozens of states, with both parties in an intelligence agency connection, with the modems between the Secretary of State's office and all the voting machines, even though they're different companies, the modems are where they're loading the software in and tallying the fraud.
[01:39:38.808 --> 01:39:47.891]  Everybody looking at these documents that Bev Harris has seen that we got, and she says, no, these are real, this is bombshell, showing the fraud in Kentucky and more.
[01:39:51.243 --> 01:39:56.787]  Illegal aliens voting, aliens voting, Republicans who don't live in the state voting for Democrats.
[01:39:56.787 --> 01:39:58.869]  The Republican governor only lost by 5,000 votes.
[01:39:58.869 --> 01:40:01.151]  He should contest it, and he is.
[01:40:01.151 --> 01:40:03.273]  But not with a recount that's run at the same computers again.
[01:40:03.273 --> 01:40:10.558]  You have to show the index of the 175,000 people off the rolls they put back on that aren't even citizens.
[01:40:10.558 --> 01:40:12.960]  Reportedly, there's more than 20,000 of those in there.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:17.104]  Then that ends the whole election, because you match that to who voted in that name.
[01:40:17.104 --> 01:40:18.024]  Game over!
[01:40:21.206 --> 01:40:25.909]  But you see, people go, well then why do the Republicans stay in office in some places?
[01:40:25.909 --> 01:40:29.212]  Because the blue bloods know how this game works.
[01:40:29.212 --> 01:40:36.577]  And they know the Republicans are really the dominant party in this country, except for the few blue cities the globalists control where they fully exploit the slaves.
[01:40:36.577 --> 01:40:42.201]  So they've got a deal with the deep state where they divide up who gets different territories, just like mafias.
[01:40:42.201 --> 01:40:45.083]  But the last decade or so, the Democrats started cheating.
[01:40:45.083 --> 01:40:47.325]  It was like China had a globalist deal to sell out America.
[01:40:49.633 --> 01:40:50.454]  But slowly.
[01:40:50.454 --> 01:40:52.156]  They're doing it too quickly.
[01:40:52.156 --> 01:40:53.917]  They weren't supposed to launch their military right away.
[01:40:53.917 --> 01:40:58.162]  They weren't supposed to expand and announce they would dominate it right away.
[01:40:58.162 --> 01:41:06.490]  So they broke those public agreements.
[01:41:06.490 --> 01:41:09.874]  And so now the deals are broken and the Democrats are trying to become a one-party state.
[01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:28.284]  So the Republicans have figured out they've broken the deal, and the Blue Bloods are all resigning to go get jobs, or they get blackmailed and exposed, but all the real Republicans are staying in and saying, election fraud, treason, Chi-Com traitors, kangaroo courts.
[01:41:28.284 --> 01:41:33.568]  They're trying to kill us, breaking our ribs, shooting us.
[01:41:33.568 --> 01:41:35.089]  It's treason.
[01:41:35.089 --> 01:41:36.290]  They're against America.
[01:41:38.032 --> 01:41:39.893]  Because that's what it is.
[01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:41.494]  That's what's happened.
[01:41:41.494 --> 01:41:43.155]  That's what's gone on.
[01:41:43.155 --> 01:41:44.876]  That's what's unfolding.
[01:41:44.876 --> 01:41:51.359]  That's what's developing.
[01:41:51.359 --> 01:41:51.859]  And that's it.
[01:41:51.859 --> 01:41:55.221]  Are you an American or are you a globalist?
[01:41:55.221 --> 01:41:57.902]  And so that caller calls in and says, there's nothing going on.
[01:41:57.902 --> 01:41:58.963]  There's no deep state.
[01:41:58.963 --> 01:42:02.885]  I'm like, wow, Trump sure beat the deep state's ass.
[01:42:02.885 --> 01:42:04.846]  The guy's like, nope, doesn't exist.
[01:42:06.903 --> 01:42:11.106]  We really ought to tell that to Brennan who goes on TV and says, thank God for the deep state.
[01:42:11.106 --> 01:42:18.672]  Our intelligence agencies will remove him for the good of the nation when they stand for getting rid of it and almost did.
[01:42:18.672 --> 01:42:28.019]  But the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[01:42:28.019 --> 01:42:30.101]  Humpty Dumpty ain't getting put back together again.
[01:42:30.101 --> 01:42:34.825]  I'm going to write your calls to come back in with that Trump clip, because I know you didn't want to hear Trump talk about kicking their ass.
[01:42:34.825 --> 01:42:36.446]  And yeah, in the real world, we're kicking their ass.
[01:42:38.496 --> 01:42:47.002]  But you see, we have to identify the fact, how pathetic is Kelly, and Tillerson, and Hillary, and all that, that they can't beat Infowars, that we beat them.
[01:42:47.002 --> 01:42:56.268]  There's the secret, is realizing how much power we have, and that we're promoting justice and freedom, and a nation for all, and there's not even a debate with these people.
[01:42:56.268 --> 01:42:59.230]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[01:43:00.407 --> 01:43:03.911]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:14.225]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[01:43:14.225 --> 01:43:16.628]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[01:43:17.188 --> 01:43:23.634]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[01:43:23.634 --> 01:43:30.700]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[01:43:30.700 --> 01:43:33.243]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[01:43:33.883 --> 01:43:38.125]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[01:43:38.125 --> 01:43:42.027]  We have a it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap.
[01:43:42.027 --> 01:43:42.887]  It's black and white.
[01:43:42.887 --> 01:43:43.387]  Very nice.
[01:43:43.387 --> 01:43:44.868]  It has the okay symbol on it.
[01:43:44.868 --> 01:43:46.689]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[01:43:46.689 --> 01:43:48.689]  Infowars.com is on the back.

[01:44:05.333 --> 01:44:14.063]  We have really great products at Infolwerestore.com and we have the Alexa Pure Breeze that every year around this time we are able to offer at their cost.
[01:44:14.423 --> 01:44:18.264]  And then we're given a rebate for the new year when we purchase these.
[01:44:18.264 --> 01:44:19.625]  That's what I have to pay taxes on.
[01:44:19.625 --> 01:44:22.865]  This is $147, is the cost, with free shipping.
[01:44:22.865 --> 01:44:24.106]  They've never done a deal that good.
[01:44:24.106 --> 01:44:25.326]  It's a hot item.
[01:44:25.326 --> 01:44:27.647]  They sell tens of thousands of these a year.
[01:44:27.647 --> 01:44:29.687]  It's a four-stage ion cluster.
[01:44:29.687 --> 01:44:32.088]  Other competing brands are $400, $500, $600, $700.
[01:44:32.088 --> 01:44:34.789]  All the markup.
[01:44:34.789 --> 01:44:37.450]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we usually sell these all day long for $250.
[01:44:37.450 --> 01:44:37.970]  They're a great deal.
[01:44:39.265 --> 01:44:39.365]  147.
[01:44:39.365 --> 01:44:43.047]  I've told the guy, like, this cuts into the market.
[01:44:43.047 --> 01:44:43.947]  Selling this low.
[01:44:43.947 --> 01:44:44.927]  People don't appreciate it.
[01:44:44.927 --> 01:44:46.988]  Well, this is what the InfoWars audience gets.
[01:44:46.988 --> 01:44:47.968]  InfoWarshore.com.
[01:44:47.968 --> 01:44:51.530]  There's only a few hundred of these left at this price.
[01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:53.931]  And then more don't come in until next year.
[01:44:58.594 --> 01:45:02.277]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[01:45:02.277 --> 01:45:10.263]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[01:45:10.263 --> 01:45:12.845]  It's just that simple.
[01:45:12.845 --> 01:45:19.250]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:19.771]  Others like
[01:45:20.331 --> 01:45:22.432]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[01:45:22.432 --> 01:45:23.152]  Get both.
[01:45:23.152 --> 01:45:24.613]  They're both great for you.
[01:45:24.613 --> 01:45:29.035]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[01:45:29.035 --> 01:45:31.256]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[01:45:31.256 --> 01:45:32.597]  That's why I harp on it.
[01:45:32.597 --> 01:45:36.778]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[01:45:36.778 --> 01:45:38.939]  Lower IQ makes you sluggish.
[01:45:38.939 --> 01:45:40.020]  You don't live as long.

[01:45:45.182 --> 01:45:46.363]  All of our bodies are different.
[01:45:46.363 --> 01:45:48.184]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[01:45:48.184 --> 01:45:50.285]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[01:45:50.285 --> 01:45:55.929]  There's a lot of factors that go into this, and I'm not telling you something you don't know, but I'm here to tell you.

[01:46:22.015 --> 01:46:23.356]  I have more energy.
[01:46:23.356 --> 01:46:24.177]  I lose weight.

[01:46:24.958 --> 01:46:26.519]  Everybody notices.
[01:46:26.519 --> 01:46:33.045]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2 Body's Ultimate Turmeric.

[01:47:00.027 --> 01:47:02.669]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:18.885 --> 01:47:23.211]  And I'll tell you, the whistleblower, I call him the fake whistleblower.
[01:47:23.211 --> 01:47:26.935]  He gave a fake report of my phone call.
[01:47:26.935 --> 01:47:32.602]  And when I did it, all of a sudden, when I released that call, all of a sudden everybody disappeared.
[01:47:32.602 --> 01:47:34.385]  The whistleblower disappeared.
[01:47:34.385 --> 01:47:36.527]  Whatever happened to the second whistleblower?
[01:47:37.348 --> 01:47:40.750]  Why isn't the first whistleblower going to testify anymore?
[01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:41.651]  You know why?
[01:47:41.651 --> 01:47:45.694]  Because everything he wrote in that report almost was a lie.
[01:47:45.694 --> 01:47:48.415]  Because he made a phony phone call.
[01:47:48.415 --> 01:47:50.076]  My phone call was perfect.
[01:47:50.076 --> 01:47:51.597]  He made it sound bad.
[01:47:51.597 --> 01:47:53.939]  That's why I had to release.
[01:47:53.939 --> 01:47:57.541]  So the whistleblower is a disgrace to our country.
[01:47:57.541 --> 01:47:58.562]  A disgrace.
[01:47:58.562 --> 01:48:02.084]  And the whistleblower, because of that, should be revealed.
[01:48:02.084 --> 01:48:02.564]  And his lawyer,
[01:48:04.045 --> 01:48:15.169]  Who said the worst thing possible, two years ago, he should be sued, and maybe for treason, maybe for treason, but he should be sued.
[01:48:15.169 --> 01:48:18.330]  His lawyer is a disgrace, a disgrace.
[01:48:18.330 --> 01:48:23.652]  And then ask him this, where is the second whistleblower, right?
[01:48:23.652 --> 01:48:27.253]  Where is the witness that gave the whistleblower the information?
[01:48:27.253 --> 01:48:28.334]  They all disappeared.
[01:48:29.235 --> 01:48:33.238]  Because Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician.
[01:48:33.238 --> 01:48:35.060]  He's corrupt!
[01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:38.082]  He made up a speech and he put my voice in it.
[01:48:38.082 --> 01:48:40.064]  He made up a speech.
[01:48:40.064 --> 01:48:42.286]  Had nothing to do with what I said.
[01:48:42.286 --> 01:48:53.295]  Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician that's not giving us due process, not giving us lawyers, and despite all that, we're kicking their ass.
[01:48:57.011 --> 01:49:01.132]  Don't hold your breath, whistleblower from Texas.
[01:49:01.132 --> 01:49:07.233]  When you're not, you're God, Eric Ciaramella.
[01:49:07.233 --> 01:49:12.254]  Who can't have his name known, even though it's legal and lawful to put it out, because people are being mean to him.
[01:49:12.254 --> 01:49:16.414]  Oh, a CIA agent.
[01:49:16.414 --> 01:49:20.555]  Looks like a libtard, libtard.
[01:49:20.555 --> 01:49:23.196]  Looks like he's got like a 60 IQ.
[01:49:23.196 --> 01:49:25.696]  Can't even tie his shoelaces, making sure make-up crap.
[01:49:27.307 --> 01:49:30.029]  The Deep State.
[01:49:30.029 --> 01:49:31.109]  And where's it going for him?
[01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:34.291]  A bunch of pretentious fops.
[01:49:34.291 --> 01:49:41.256]  A bunch of wannabe blue-blood jokers.
[01:49:41.256 --> 01:49:42.636]  Oh, but Trump's inept.
[01:49:42.636 --> 01:49:44.278]  He kicked your ass.
[01:49:44.278 --> 01:49:45.618]  We're kicking your ass.
[01:49:45.618 --> 01:49:48.880]  This listenership who are in the arena are kicking your ass.
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:51.362]  We're going back to your calls.
[01:49:51.362 --> 01:49:54.464]  But... I'm gonna say it again.
[01:49:55.981 --> 01:50:02.486]  The globalists think they own this nation and they're mad that we have a president that thinks he's the president.
[01:50:02.486 --> 01:50:06.749]  But he is encircled by traitors that tell him they're going to do what he says and then don't do it.
[01:50:06.749 --> 01:50:11.993]  And then it turns out his plans, his idea have been excellent.
[01:50:11.993 --> 01:50:20.579]  And are the deals that were agreed upon decades ago, in the case of the Kurds and the Syrians and all the rest of them, it ends the conflict.
[01:50:22.159 --> 01:50:23.861]  But the system doesn't want that.
[01:50:23.861 --> 01:50:27.426]  All these geniuses that pat each other on the back.
[01:50:27.426 --> 01:50:31.652]  And now you're going to see more and more lies and more and more fake whistleblowers.
[01:50:31.652 --> 01:50:32.893]  But Trump's not going to resign.
[01:50:32.893 --> 01:50:36.398]  He's going to go all the way.
[01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:42.751]  Everybody's surrounded by a bunch of cowards because the swamp is deep.
[01:50:42.751 --> 01:50:46.232]  It's been bringing its people in forever and America has become soft.
[01:50:46.232 --> 01:50:50.913]  There's a lot of good people, a lot of strong people, but we didn't desire power.
[01:50:50.913 --> 01:50:52.993]  We didn't get into government.
[01:50:52.993 --> 01:50:57.994]  And so these systems are just filled with ass kissers that don't care about the nation.
[01:50:57.994 --> 01:50:58.775]  In fact, they hate it.
[01:50:58.775 --> 01:51:01.395]  And they tell us they do.
[01:51:01.395 --> 01:51:04.156]  And you look at the whistleblowers and who their lawyers are.
[01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:10.914]  You see the things they say and they do openly promoting pedophilia?
[01:51:10.914 --> 01:51:15.135]  Saying they love to defend people that are pedophiles and give them national security clearances?
[01:51:15.135 --> 01:51:17.376]  Why would you say that in public?
[01:51:17.376 --> 01:51:20.277]  Even if you were one of those people?
[01:51:20.277 --> 01:51:24.279]  And it's because they're bad news, folks!
[01:51:24.279 --> 01:51:29.581]  And they think we're done!
[01:51:29.581 --> 01:51:31.681]  What do you think it'll be like if you roll over to these maniacs?
[01:51:31.681 --> 01:51:33.122]  You think it'll get better or a lot worse?
[01:51:37.412 --> 01:51:40.234]  Steve in Colorado, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:51:40.234 --> 01:51:40.534]  Go ahead.
[01:51:40.534 --> 01:51:41.074]  Thanks for holding.
[01:51:41.074 --> 01:51:43.376]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[01:51:43.376 --> 01:51:47.318]  I've been listening to you since you started.
[01:51:47.318 --> 01:51:48.699]  First time I've ever called.
[01:51:48.699 --> 01:51:49.380]  Well, God bless you.
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:51.601]  Thanks for getting on.
[01:51:51.601 --> 01:51:53.342]  Thank you.
[01:51:53.342 --> 01:51:56.104]  Well, you know, we know what they're doing.
[01:51:56.104 --> 01:51:58.346]  You can see what they're doing.
[01:51:58.346 --> 01:52:01.127]  And it's not going to stop.
[01:52:01.127 --> 01:52:01.968]  This isn't going to stop.
[01:52:02.807 --> 01:52:10.313]  You know, there's not going to be anything on mainstream to let the American people think that, oh, maybe these people are doing something wrong.
[01:52:10.313 --> 01:52:18.338]  And if they can't take him out in handcuffs like they want, they want him in handcuffs in front of the American people.
[01:52:18.338 --> 01:52:26.184]  If they can't do that, if there's any hint that there actually can be elected, that's when they're going to blow this thing up.
[01:52:26.184 --> 01:52:29.307]  They're not going to allow him to be elected.
[01:52:29.307 --> 01:52:31.248]  They're going to blow this whole thing up completely.
[01:52:34.130 --> 01:52:38.251]  And then the question is, is, well, when do we call in the Marines?
[01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:43.672]  Well, you can't call in the Marines right now because he'd look like a dictator and obstruction.
[01:52:43.672 --> 01:52:50.853]  So he's got to let them do their whole fake illegal scheme.
[01:52:50.853 --> 01:52:57.095]  And then when it comes time where they are actually going to try to remove him, that's when you can pull the trigger.
[01:52:57.095 --> 01:53:03.816]  If, if the circumstances allow, I mean, they're going to either pull him out of there in handcuffs or a straitjacket.
[01:53:05.357 --> 01:53:09.249]  They are not going to allow him to be elected.
[01:53:09.249 --> 01:53:10.193]  Period.
[01:53:10.193 --> 01:53:11.136]  This is it.
[01:53:11.136 --> 01:53:11.396]  It's done.
[01:53:12.981 --> 01:53:16.303]  And the Democrats have said that they're coming after everybody after that.
[01:53:16.303 --> 01:53:18.304]  And so, I'll tell you, I'm not scared.
[01:53:18.304 --> 01:53:19.645]  They ought to be scared.
[01:53:19.645 --> 01:53:21.546]  But see, these guys always push and push.
[01:53:21.546 --> 01:53:23.127]  And that's the good news.
[01:53:23.127 --> 01:53:24.308]  You're right, they're not going to stop.
[01:53:24.308 --> 01:53:27.750]  And then they're going to run into an immovable force.
[01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:29.811]  And that's the way these things tend to go.
[01:53:29.811 --> 01:53:31.892]  And it's very, very sad.
[01:53:31.892 --> 01:53:34.434]  But America's forgotten our poor children.
[01:53:34.434 --> 01:53:36.015]  We've killed 60 million-plus babies.
[01:53:36.015 --> 01:53:38.596]  And now we keep them alive and sell their organs.
[01:53:38.596 --> 01:53:41.358]  And now pedophilia is being mainlined.
[01:53:41.358 --> 01:53:42.459]  And so we're a cursed nation.
[01:53:43.453 --> 01:53:48.375]  And if we don't support Trump, if we don't turn the tide, then we deserve what happens to us.
[01:53:48.375 --> 01:53:48.875]  God bless you.
[01:53:48.875 --> 01:53:49.775]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:53:49.775 --> 01:53:53.637]  A lot of calls about Steve Pucinich.
[01:53:53.637 --> 01:53:57.258]  We ought to get him back on the show.
[01:53:57.258 --> 01:53:59.319]  Dad in Utah wants to talk about Pucinich.
[01:53:59.319 --> 01:54:00.039]  So does Casey.
[01:54:00.039 --> 01:54:05.021]  He's saying that the mole, the anonymous person in the New York Times is Bolton.
[01:54:05.021 --> 01:54:06.402]  Well, I said that back when he got in.
[01:54:07.418 --> 01:54:08.159]  And he is the one.
[01:54:08.159 --> 01:54:10.660]  And now he's going to testify against the president.
[01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:11.801]  Against the president's orders.
[01:54:11.801 --> 01:54:14.623]  Because that's the executive's prerogative to say, no you don't.
[01:54:14.623 --> 01:54:15.564]  Separation of powers.
[01:54:15.564 --> 01:54:17.205]  It's just incredible.
[01:54:17.205 --> 01:54:22.969]  So let's go ahead and go to Thad in Utah.
[01:54:22.969 --> 01:54:23.509]  You're on the air.
[01:54:23.509 --> 01:54:23.870]  Go ahead.
[01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:26.692]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:54:26.692 --> 01:54:29.473]  This is Thad, aka Chief Bowles with Titans of Liberty.
[01:54:29.473 --> 01:54:30.834]  How you doing today?
[01:54:30.834 --> 01:54:34.197]  I'm very glad to hear that you have Steve Pachenik on the radio again.
[01:54:35.502 --> 01:54:41.067]  You know, Dr. Steve has been putting it out there with Bolton and his white shoe boy ties to Yale.
[01:54:41.067 --> 01:54:53.397]  He's always been, unequivocally, been in the power circle that's basically driving this coup d'etat against our great 45.
[01:54:53.397 --> 01:54:56.660]  It's amazing to hear Steve Puchenik on your program again.
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:58.562]  It's been a while.
[01:54:58.562 --> 01:54:59.263]  Alex.
[01:54:59.263 --> 01:55:01.805]  Yeah, if you want him to come on, he's refused to come on the show.
[01:55:03.021 --> 01:55:03.141]  He's
[01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.991]  Well, I'm not.
[01:55:36.527 --> 01:55:37.468]  I'm not trying to put him down.
[01:55:37.468 --> 01:55:39.049]  You were just kind of like, hey, where's Pachenek?
[01:55:39.049 --> 01:55:40.050]  And I get a lot of that.
[01:55:40.050 --> 01:55:41.691]  So I'm like, well, he refuses to go on the show.
[01:55:41.691 --> 01:55:44.353]  We've invited him on the show many times.
[01:55:44.353 --> 01:55:46.135]  And I'm not going to say he's a coward.
[01:55:46.135 --> 01:55:48.317]  I know he got put under a lot of heat coming on.
[01:55:48.317 --> 01:55:49.658]  He's been called into federal court.
[01:55:49.658 --> 01:55:50.899]  He's been called into federal court.
[01:55:51.639 --> 01:55:53.240]  On other things that were said on the show.
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:55.481]  So there's a lot of stuff behind the scenes.
[01:55:55.481 --> 01:55:59.664]  And he's still speaking out and saying more bold things than ever that I agree with.
[01:55:59.664 --> 01:56:01.925]  The things I've seen are dead on.
[01:56:01.925 --> 01:56:04.907]  And so, yeah, he's been a source on many things.
[01:56:04.907 --> 01:56:08.049]  We have a lot of other sources and he's invited on the show tomorrow.
[01:56:08.869 --> 01:56:10.470]  I might have just pissed him off, too, one day.
[01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:12.471]  I was up here and had a guest on before.
[01:56:12.471 --> 01:56:13.531]  I made him hold like 15 minutes.
[01:56:13.531 --> 01:56:17.032]  And then he got real pissed off and said, you know, I'm not coming on anymore.
[01:56:17.032 --> 01:56:18.753]  He made me hold or whatever.
[01:56:18.753 --> 01:56:21.334]  And I'm like, well, come on, I won't make you hold.
[01:56:21.334 --> 01:56:23.235]  He goes, no, I'm too old.
[01:56:23.235 --> 01:56:24.195]  Hang up on me.
[01:56:24.195 --> 01:56:26.636]  So that's the last conversation I had with him.
[01:56:26.636 --> 01:56:29.177]  So I get he's an old cranky man, but he's a good guy.
[01:56:29.177 --> 01:56:30.238]  He should come back on the show.
[01:56:32.807 --> 01:56:33.768]  Don't misunderstand me.
[01:56:33.768 --> 01:56:37.390]  I have the utmost admiration for Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:39.732]  I mean, he has been at the forefront... No, he's a great guy.
[01:56:39.732 --> 01:56:40.773]  He's invited on the show.
[01:56:40.773 --> 01:56:42.194]  Just hold on just a second.
[01:56:42.194 --> 01:56:42.775]  Stay there.
[01:56:42.775 --> 01:56:45.016]  Faz is running a Pachinik discussion now.
[01:56:45.016 --> 01:56:49.480]  Maybe that'll flush him out of the bushes and get him on the show.
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:52.422]  And then we're going to come back to other callers who want to talk about him, like Casey.
[01:56:52.422 --> 01:56:54.584]  Then we've got a guest about 20 minutes to the next hour.
[01:56:54.584 --> 01:56:56.205]  Coming in, former frontman of the Misfits.
[01:56:56.205 --> 01:56:57.966]  Always interesting when he's been with us.
[01:56:57.966 --> 01:56:58.567]  And so much more.
[01:56:58.567 --> 01:56:59.748]  I've got to plug once this hour.
[01:57:01.656 --> 01:57:07.242]  We still have the Everything Must Go special, except a lot of things have sold out or they're about to sell out, so a lot of things are being taken off.
[01:57:07.242 --> 01:57:12.087]  So I haven't come up with a new special, so what I'm doing is things that are selling out or about to sell out are being taken off.
[01:57:12.087 --> 01:57:14.429]  So a lot of your best-selling items will be taken off by today.

[01:57:38.132 --> 01:57:41.195]  The adult is basically sold out so I can't offer 50% off.

[01:57:46.263 --> 01:57:47.884]  The Alex Jones Show!

[01:59:03.090 --> 01:59:08.995]  Ladies and gentlemen, X2 and X3 are two amazing formulas of iodine.

[01:59:10.656 --> 01:59:12.658]  See which one works best for you.
[01:59:12.658 --> 01:59:16.942]  Bio-True Selenium from the mustard seed supercharges all of it.
[01:59:16.942 --> 01:59:19.924]  We have this best deal ever on these products.

[01:59:24.007 --> 01:59:26.930]  But we're about to have to end this special.
[01:59:27.150 --> 01:59:32.114]  The Everything Must Go Super sale is the main sale, and this sale is part of that sale.
[01:59:32.114 --> 01:59:34.817]  It's going to have to end by early next week.
[01:59:34.817 --> 01:59:44.565]  So, support yourself, support your family, and fund the InfoWars at InfoWarsStore.com with this Stop the I9 Conspiracy special.
[01:59:44.565 --> 01:59:49.950]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:52.592]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:00.692 --> 02:00:02.814]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.814 --> 02:00:07.399]  Because there is a war on, or you're mine.
[02:00:07.399 --> 02:00:11.623]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[02:00:11.623 --> 02:00:16.467]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[02:00:16.467 --> 02:00:19.731]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[02:00:19.731 --> 02:00:22.573]  Because when you're out there, so much space.
[02:00:28.476 --> 02:00:32.717]  But it wasn't because I didn't know enough.
[02:00:32.717 --> 02:00:34.337]  I know too much.
[02:00:34.337 --> 02:00:35.497]  That does make me crazy.
[02:00:35.497 --> 02:00:40.539]  Alright, Thad in Utah.
[02:00:40.539 --> 02:00:41.859]  This is all transparent.
[02:00:41.859 --> 02:00:43.339]  We know it's Bolton.
[02:00:43.339 --> 02:00:44.259]  We always knew.
[02:00:44.259 --> 02:00:53.361]  And if you want to say something Trump's done that's incompetent, is he brought in all these deep staters because they'd lie to his face.
[02:00:53.361 --> 02:00:54.702]  And he'd never seen that in business.
[02:00:54.702 --> 02:00:56.742]  People get promoted in business for doing well and
[02:00:58.268 --> 02:01:00.129]  Executing properly and he thought it.
[02:01:00.129 --> 02:01:24.708]  Oh, we just had bad management people want America to continue on and not go bankrupt and No, they want to destroy the country and he said that he said I underestimated how bad the swamp is and how corrupt they are and how much they hate the country because he offers a money and power not to sell it out a big seat at the table these minions and They're working for other groups
[02:01:26.075 --> 02:01:31.045]  See, Trump's his own man, so he projects onto them that, hey, come on to Team America.
[02:01:31.045 --> 02:01:32.788]  You'll be more successful.
[02:01:32.788 --> 02:01:33.890]  And you don't have to screw anybody over.
[02:01:33.890 --> 02:01:35.052]  They're like, no!
[02:01:35.052 --> 02:01:35.914]  I'm better than you!
[02:01:35.914 --> 02:01:36.636]  I'm a genius!
[02:01:36.636 --> 02:01:37.317]  You're an idiot!
[02:01:37.317 --> 02:01:38.118]  America sucks!
[02:01:39.127 --> 02:01:40.688]  That's the elitism behind the scenes.
[02:01:40.688 --> 02:01:42.028]  Now it's out in the open.
[02:01:42.028 --> 02:01:43.849]  And Trump's like, what?
[02:01:43.849 --> 02:01:48.490]  You'll be more powerful and make more money and have a seat helping run America.
[02:01:48.490 --> 02:01:50.791]  Just don't F the country over.
[02:01:50.791 --> 02:01:51.491]  And you don't want it?
[02:01:51.491 --> 02:01:52.571]  They go, that's right.
[02:01:52.571 --> 02:01:53.832]  And I'm going to get you.
[02:01:53.832 --> 02:01:55.112]  I'm better than you.
[02:01:55.112 --> 02:01:56.953]  It's the little ding dong syndrome.
[02:01:58.530 --> 02:02:01.511]  It's the chicken sh-t dimension.
[02:02:01.511 --> 02:02:04.651]  These people, it's spiritual folks and you've got to get that.
[02:02:04.651 --> 02:02:08.972]  Because the average American is nice and cares and isn't arrogant and is humble.
[02:02:08.972 --> 02:02:11.453]  And we project that onto these people.
[02:02:11.453 --> 02:02:15.434]  Like the so-called whistleblowers.
[02:02:15.434 --> 02:02:17.674]  Lawyer.
[02:02:17.674 --> 02:02:21.755]  And you research these people and they're almost all like signaling, hey I like
[02:02:22.602 --> 02:02:24.263]  Creepypasta girls.
[02:02:24.263 --> 02:02:30.826]  I go photograph them alone at Disney World and at water parks and I represent pedophiles and I think Jeffrey Epstein's great!
[02:02:30.826 --> 02:02:34.707]  And I get pedophiles jobs in national security!
[02:02:34.707 --> 02:02:37.869]  I mean, why the hell would you tell people that on Twitter?
[02:02:37.869 --> 02:02:41.950]  Because, man, these folks are taking over.
[02:02:41.950 --> 02:02:45.272]  The people that do it and then the Renfields that assist in it.
[02:02:48.379 --> 02:02:49.820]  And so, there you go.
[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:56.102]  I mean, when you're faced with something like this, people just don't know what to do.
[02:02:56.102 --> 02:02:58.644]  That's how they got the Boy Scouts of America, just like the Catholic Church.
[02:02:58.644 --> 02:03:01.905]  They start taking over, and then people can't believe it.
[02:03:01.905 --> 02:03:08.188]  Well, it'll bring down the church, it'll bring down Boy Scouts, it's so pervasive, and then you start turning a blind eye.
[02:03:08.188 --> 02:03:13.530]  Now you're complicit, and now they take over the whole shooting match.
[02:03:13.530 --> 02:03:14.891]  That's how you compromise something.
[02:03:16.752 --> 02:03:18.453]  So you can't compromise with any of it.
[02:03:18.453 --> 02:03:21.254]  Just say, full speed attack!
[02:03:21.254 --> 02:03:23.755]  See, that's why I always say I frontal attack.
[02:03:23.755 --> 02:03:28.017]  I could get all Machiavelli, but that's a mental illness and creep around and do side things and dirty tricks.
[02:03:28.017 --> 02:03:29.338]  They always think I'm doing that.
[02:03:29.338 --> 02:03:45.286]  The Globals have been so freaked out in all these lawsuits, they haven't found any dirty tricks, any secretiveness, any manipulations, because I've chosen to go full broad daylight frontal attack, because I don't even want to play games with my brain to get into a position where I operate like they do, even in the name of good.
[02:03:47.261 --> 02:03:53.707]  Because then you spend your energy in all these other manipulations instead of just full-bore attack.
[02:03:53.707 --> 02:04:00.714]  It's the spectacle I want of us crashing into them and exploding and burning, quite frankly.
[02:04:00.714 --> 02:04:07.301]  And it's not that I'm a sadist or want to get hurt or want to be a martyr.
[02:04:07.301 --> 02:04:09.944]  I just cannot merge my interdimensional
[02:04:11.306 --> 02:04:14.728]  Essence with devil-worshipping Satanist scumbags.
[02:04:14.728 --> 02:04:21.612]  So my will is, assault them with everything I've got and if I get destroyed in the process and torn inside out, that's good.
[02:04:21.612 --> 02:04:25.275]  Because I will certainly not be with them.
[02:04:25.275 --> 02:04:31.598]  I want to hit them and explode, incinerating their operation.
[02:04:31.598 --> 02:04:32.179]  And I want
[02:04:33.331 --> 02:04:42.795]  In the last essence of feeling I have to bring them down, burning and collapsing into hell with giant... The only thing I'd go to hell for would be to take them to hell!
[02:04:42.795 --> 02:04:48.637]  I want to be with God so bad, if God wants to send me to hell to take them, then damn me to hell!
[02:04:48.637 --> 02:04:50.258]  If I need to go to hell, I will!
[02:04:56.525 --> 02:04:59.246]  Please support us as well and spread the word about the transmission.
[02:04:59.246 --> 02:05:03.168]  And remember, your financial support is what makes this possible.
[02:05:03.168 --> 02:05:04.528]  Plus, we make it easy.
[02:05:04.528 --> 02:05:07.229]  We have really great products at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:05:07.229 --> 02:05:13.652]  And we have the Alexa Pure Breeze that every year around this time, we are able to offer at their cost.
[02:05:13.652 --> 02:05:17.473]  And then we're given a rebate for the new year when we purchase these.
[02:05:17.473 --> 02:05:18.614]  That's what I have to pay taxes on.
[02:05:18.854 --> 02:05:22.075]  This is $147, is the cost, with free shipping.
[02:05:22.075 --> 02:05:23.316]  They've never done a deal that good.
[02:05:23.316 --> 02:05:24.516]  It's a hot item.
[02:05:24.516 --> 02:05:26.837]  They sell tens of thousands of these a year.
[02:05:26.837 --> 02:05:28.898]  It's a four-stage ion cluster.
[02:05:28.898 --> 02:05:31.299]  Other competing brands are $400, $500, $600, $700.
[02:05:31.299 --> 02:05:34.000]  All the markup.
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.662]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we usually sell these all day long for $250.
[02:05:36.662 --> 02:05:37.162]  They're a great deal.
[02:05:38.486 --> 02:05:38.566]  147.
[02:05:38.566 --> 02:05:42.109]  I've told the guy, like, this cuts into the market.
[02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:43.090]  It's all just slow.
[02:05:43.090 --> 02:05:44.151]  People don't appreciate it.
[02:05:44.151 --> 02:05:46.193]  Well, this is what the InfoWars audience gets.
[02:05:46.193 --> 02:05:50.736]  InfoWarshore.com, there's only a few hundred of these left at this price.
[02:05:50.736 --> 02:05:58.863]  And then more don't come in until next year.
[02:05:58.863 --> 02:06:01.545]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:01.545 --> 02:06:06.670]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:20.114 --> 02:06:24.925]  Well, if you just joined us, Nikki Haley came out and said what we already knew and what we broke exclusively over two years ago.
[02:06:24.925 --> 02:06:28.293]  Rex Tellerson.
[02:06:28.293 --> 02:06:28.614]  Kelly.
[02:06:30.026 --> 02:06:34.167]  Well Alex, really all I wanted to say in regards to that whistleblower in Texas
[02:07:00.493 --> 02:07:07.056]  Uh, this is something that we hear quite frequently, and it's mostly with people who are just completely uninformed.
[02:07:07.056 --> 02:07:16.480]  And, uh, you could hear the, uh, the joy in that person's voice in regards to having a president.
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:21.522]  Well, you could hear the conceited power trip of someone that's powerless, too.
[02:07:21.522 --> 02:07:22.362]  Did you hear the weakness?
[02:07:23.504 --> 02:07:24.204]  Absolutely.
[02:07:24.204 --> 02:07:24.725]  Absolutely.
[02:07:24.725 --> 02:07:30.807]  And as somebody who just left Austin, Texas, I can tell you that is something that I heard quite a bit.
[02:07:30.807 --> 02:07:32.728]  I just left Austin.
[02:07:32.728 --> 02:07:39.612]  And that little snarky tone is something that has very much invaded the great state of Texas.
[02:07:39.612 --> 02:07:40.612]  Texas is in trouble.
[02:07:40.612 --> 02:07:41.913]  The whole country's in trouble.
[02:07:41.913 --> 02:07:42.893]  People ask, why do I live here?
[02:07:42.893 --> 02:07:45.714]  This is where my family's from since the literal 1820s.
[02:07:49.474 --> 02:07:59.758]  And just to watch Texas fall to the sickness, the same snake that bit California, used to be as conservative as we are, now it's slithered over here and people say, why do they bring it with them?
[02:07:59.758 --> 02:08:02.519]  Because they're the ones that suck California dry.
[02:08:02.519 --> 02:08:04.660]  They're the soulless vampires and now they're here.
[02:08:06.762 --> 02:08:07.962]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:08:07.962 --> 02:08:17.665]  And you know, for someone to just blurt out that they believe or they do not believe that the Deep State actually exists just goes to show you that they do not read The Economist.
[02:08:17.665 --> 02:08:21.707]  They did not read the Agenda 2030.
[02:08:21.707 --> 02:08:24.788]  It's all public, Financial Times, Atlantic Monthly.
[02:08:24.788 --> 02:08:25.828]  The Globalist admitted
[02:08:27.048 --> 02:08:34.231]  Again, I was being offered 20 years ago $10 million a year in book deals and Glenn Beck's job before he even existed.
[02:08:34.231 --> 02:08:37.772]  And I mean, I had it on paper from the big corporations.
[02:08:37.772 --> 02:08:41.533]  I mean, that guy would fall over in a second if somebody offered him $10 million.
[02:08:41.533 --> 02:08:46.815]  But nobody's offered him $10 million because he doesn't have any talent or the spark of leadership.
[02:08:46.815 --> 02:08:54.337]  They're all a bunch of sycophants that think if they kiss butt long enough, they'll finally be a real man when they'll never be a real man.
[02:08:54.337 --> 02:08:54.918]  God bless you.
[02:08:54.918 --> 02:08:55.638]  I appreciate your call.
[02:08:56.664 --> 02:08:59.805]  Yeah, that $10 million a year is pretty cheap now, huh?
[02:08:59.805 --> 02:09:05.488]  Takes, what, $30, $40 million a year to run Infowars, all the bandwidth, all the crew, all the legal?
[02:09:05.488 --> 02:09:07.449]  See, that was cheap, wasn't it?
[02:09:07.449 --> 02:09:11.270]  First it was a million, then $3 million, then $10 million, then the book deals, then all of it.
[02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:17.813]  You think I want to be somebody else's man?
[02:09:17.813 --> 02:09:20.554]  You want a billion dollars to sell out humanity or a bullet in your head?
[02:09:20.554 --> 02:09:22.835]  I'll take the bullet.
[02:09:22.835 --> 02:09:24.376]  But I'll die trying to stop you.
[02:09:25.523 --> 02:09:30.546]  Because it's the soul, it's the essence, it's your will that transcends.
[02:09:30.546 --> 02:09:32.847]  Don't let them have your will!
[02:09:32.847 --> 02:09:34.748]  Don't bow your will to them!
[02:09:34.748 --> 02:09:36.249]  Bow to God!
[02:09:36.249 --> 02:09:44.074]  And then, instantly you'll go, I'm not bowing to God, I've just joined with God and I've got so much power now it's insane!
[02:09:44.074 --> 02:09:49.077]  But you won't even want the power, like the metaphor in the Bible of throwing down their crowns after
[02:09:50.706 --> 02:09:52.468]  Thousand years with, you know, Christ.
[02:09:52.468 --> 02:09:53.649]  God, I don't want these crowns.
[02:09:53.649 --> 02:09:54.570]  I don't want these awards.
[02:09:54.570 --> 02:09:57.653]  You don't want it because it doesn't matter anymore.
[02:09:57.653 --> 02:09:59.855]  The ego's gone.
[02:09:59.855 --> 02:10:01.117]  It's all the real plan.
[02:10:04.022 --> 02:10:09.824]  Casey in Mississippi wants to bring up Pachinik, who's a smart guy, Dr. C. Pachinik, who's been out there talking about the Deep State attempted coup.
[02:10:09.824 --> 02:10:10.504]  Yeah.
[02:10:10.504 --> 02:10:15.285]  The CIA, leftist globalist arms of it, are carrying out an attempt to overthrow America.
[02:10:15.285 --> 02:10:21.707]  They run the media, and it's unbelievable that all Americans don't instantly join with Trump and with Infowars against it.
[02:10:21.707 --> 02:10:25.048]  Even if you disagree with some policies of Trump, and not what they make up in the news,
[02:10:25.868 --> 02:10:27.849]  It's still about us running our own country.
[02:10:27.849 --> 02:10:35.072]  It's outside forces trying to destroy the nation-state and turn us into a vassal state of the globalists.
[02:10:35.072 --> 02:10:36.953]  We must say no.
[02:10:36.953 --> 02:10:38.294]  It's ridiculous.
[02:10:38.294 --> 02:10:40.515]  I'm surprised we're not winning by a long shot.
[02:10:40.515 --> 02:10:43.917]  We're barely beating them right now.
[02:10:43.917 --> 02:10:44.477]  Trump's right.
[02:10:44.477 --> 02:10:45.598]  We're kicking their ass.
[02:10:45.598 --> 02:10:46.118]  But you know what?
[02:10:47.779 --> 02:10:52.361]  They are squeezing the hell out of America and putting an authoritarian censorship in control.
[02:10:52.361 --> 02:10:56.904]  And if they take Trump out, they'll try to complete that because they're scared.
[02:10:56.904 --> 02:11:02.587]  They're going to accelerate the authoritarian takeover and we can't let them do that.
[02:11:02.587 --> 02:11:03.908]  Casey, Mississippi, thanks for holding.
[02:11:03.908 --> 02:11:05.188]  Go ahead.
[02:11:05.188 --> 02:11:06.349]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:11:06.349 --> 02:11:07.069]  I appreciate it.
[02:11:07.069 --> 02:11:08.530]  Thank you.
[02:11:08.530 --> 02:11:15.674]  Well, you know, anyone that says there isn't a deep state or shadow government is either disingenuous or like the last caller said,
[02:11:16.243 --> 02:11:24.649]  Doesn't have their eyes open, is not paying attention to the very clear and blatant propaganda that they put out.
[02:11:24.649 --> 02:11:25.089]  Oh, no, no.
[02:11:25.089 --> 02:11:28.111]  He did it to disrespect us and play gaslighting games.
[02:11:28.111 --> 02:11:32.334]  Because I guarantee you that guy's probably an educator or something and does that to little kids all day.
[02:11:32.334 --> 02:11:33.415]  I mean, you can hear the M.O.
[02:11:33.415 --> 02:11:34.696]  That's somebody that misleads people.
[02:11:34.696 --> 02:11:38.398]  That's somebody that enjoys leading people astray.
[02:11:38.398 --> 02:11:39.119]  Absolutely.
[02:11:39.119 --> 02:11:42.261]  And, you know, really what I would look at as the deep state would
[02:11:42.773 --> 02:11:44.374]  It was a movie that came out a while ago.
[02:11:44.374 --> 02:11:49.157]  I can't think of the name right now, but they called it a College of Corporations.
[02:11:49.157 --> 02:11:53.480]  And, you know, I think that ultimately it is that.
[02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:58.644]  It's a College of Corporations with, you know, kind of like the banking headmaster, if you will.
[02:11:58.644 --> 02:12:05.289]  Yeah, that's Network and Rollerball, the original, which show you how they really run it.
[02:12:05.289 --> 02:12:08.251]  And that's actually written by folks that were externalizing the method.
[02:12:08.251 --> 02:12:09.492]  That's actually what it is.
[02:12:09.492 --> 02:12:10.953]  It's a College of Corporations.
[02:12:12.159 --> 02:12:17.200]  I agree with you 100%, and I think a lot of the kabuki theater that we see coming out of DC is distracting us from that.
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:22.342]  You know, this control grid, which pairs with the cashless society, this cybernetic control grid,
[02:12:42.652 --> 02:12:49.257]  You know, that is 5G, that is all the smart devices, basically.
[02:12:49.257 --> 02:12:54.561]  You know, from my understanding, 5G is a computer-to-computer comms system that will connect
[02:12:55.663 --> 02:13:02.731]  Your phone, appliances, TVs, anything that has that type of... It's already doing it without asking me.
[02:13:02.731 --> 02:13:03.913]  And people say, well, just get a droid.
[02:13:03.913 --> 02:13:04.633]  It's just as bad.
[02:13:04.633 --> 02:13:08.198]  If you have one, it's all the same gloveless plan.
[02:13:08.198 --> 02:13:12.302]  And it's all these governments competing for control of the eye, of the one ring.
[02:13:12.302 --> 02:13:13.724]  It's all that allegory.
[02:13:13.724 --> 02:13:14.885]  That's how Satanism works.
[02:13:15.546 --> 02:13:19.028]  They're all building their own destruction, hoping they can be finally in control of it.
[02:13:19.028 --> 02:13:20.869]  Suddenly, I'm telling it no.
[02:13:20.869 --> 02:13:22.750]  The phone is dialed into my car.
[02:13:22.750 --> 02:13:25.732]  It knows when I need gas, where we're going, all the sensors.
[02:13:25.732 --> 02:13:26.673]  I can't turn it off.
[02:13:26.673 --> 02:13:27.633]  I go into the menus.
[02:13:27.633 --> 02:13:29.114]  It still just re-uploads.
[02:13:29.114 --> 02:13:35.138]  This is the AI push, where even if you turn it off, it's turned out Apple, Google never really turn it off.
[02:13:35.138 --> 02:13:36.499]  And now they won't let you turn it off.
[02:13:36.499 --> 02:13:39.401]  They're just letting you know, we're in control of everything.
[02:13:39.401 --> 02:13:41.142]  And they're flipping the switches on right now.
[02:13:42.512 --> 02:13:43.092]  Absolutely.
[02:13:43.092 --> 02:13:48.314]  And you said, I remember you saying, I can't think of how long ago it was, but it's over a year.
[02:13:48.314 --> 02:13:51.316]  You were talking about them terraforming the planet.
[02:13:51.316 --> 02:13:56.378]  And really, the way that strikes me now is just being terraformed for AI.
[02:13:56.378 --> 02:14:03.040]  Even the chemtrails, the stratospheric aerosol injection with the metallic oxide, makes everything more receptive to frequency.
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:08.103]  And this control grid, the cybernetic control grid, you know, is more or less run on frequencies.
[02:14:08.103 --> 02:14:11.224]  I mean, EMF, RF, ULF, everything.
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:12.721]  That's right.
[02:14:12.721 --> 02:14:15.763]  And what did they tell you in Transcendence with Johnny Depp?
[02:14:15.763 --> 02:14:19.425]  He becomes AI and becomes a dust that is in the sky.
[02:14:19.425 --> 02:14:28.612]  That is a smart dust where they can have a whole computer system, you know, way more advanced than even a smartphone, in a single molecule.
[02:14:29.272 --> 02:14:33.954]  And then it will be everything and absorb us, and that's the endgame plan where you can't escape it.
[02:14:33.954 --> 02:14:54.121]  And they're now already putting the binary weapon system into you, the aluminum dioxide and the other systems, so that then when the nanotech hits, they believe, it will then be able to find a place in your body and bind to that, and then through the 678G they're already rolling out and test, it will then be able to oscillate and program that to basically kill you, fry you.
[02:14:54.821 --> 02:14:57.422]  So the game isn't even get control of us.
[02:14:57.422 --> 02:15:04.905]  It's get control of us long enough to have us spiritually cut off from God, because our DNA has been proven to be a transceiver.
[02:15:04.905 --> 02:15:12.089]  They want to jam that frequency, then program us to worship Satan, which isn't just some cosmology out of a church.
[02:15:12.089 --> 02:15:18.732]  It is merged with that AI synthetic system, and that's what Elon Musk and others have told you their religion is.
[02:15:18.732 --> 02:15:19.232]  You go to these
[02:15:20.103 --> 02:15:47.043]  And now the FDA just came out and said, okay, we can do the ambrosia operation where parents will take their kids if they sign the agreement forms, the children have their own rights, that now they want five-year-olds to start giving blood, and the biggest people that want the money and are going to roll out the whole agreement is Silicon Valley will literally now openly be vampires, and then everybody living in the Silicon Valley area will then come and bring their fresh blood to the Silicon Valley lords who will then pump it directly into their arteries.
[02:15:47.643 --> 02:15:48.525]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[02:15:48.525 --> 02:15:49.147]  That's the whole plan.
[02:15:49.147 --> 02:15:51.672]  I think the human AI gets it, Casey.
[02:15:51.672 --> 02:15:52.133]  God bless you.
[02:15:52.133 --> 02:15:52.614]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:54.251 --> 02:15:55.512]  Maybe not today.
[02:15:55.512 --> 02:15:56.812]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:15:56.812 --> 02:16:00.554]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:00.554 --> 02:16:01.634]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:01.634 --> 02:16:03.455]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:16:03.455 --> 02:16:05.176]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[02:17:46.991 --> 02:17:57.556]  The Witch Queen of the Deep State lost the 2016 election because she was arrogant and the corporate whores in the media busily covering up her giant pedophile and blackmail rigs thought that her victory was assured.
[02:17:57.556 --> 02:17:57.856]  Now that the
[02:18:12.702 --> 02:18:14.363]  The enemy lost that election.
[02:18:14.363 --> 02:18:18.425]  They are awake and throwing everything they've got at us.
[02:18:18.425 --> 02:18:23.967]  And conservatives and nationalists and Christians and patriots, many of them, are asleep thinking 2020's in the bag.
[02:18:23.967 --> 02:18:26.529]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost Kentucky governorship.
[02:18:26.529 --> 02:18:30.431]  We just lost the Virginia Statehouse the first time in 30 years.
[02:18:30.431 --> 02:18:31.631]  This is serious.
[02:18:31.631 --> 02:18:35.233]  We can win again and secure the gains we've gotten.
[02:18:35.233 --> 02:18:37.154]  Or we can see it all wash down the drain.
[02:18:37.654 --> 02:18:41.137]  Whatever you do, get more politically activated than you ever have.
[02:18:41.137 --> 02:18:47.641]  And spread the live links at bandockvideoandimplewars.com forward slash show if you want to defeat the deep state and the globalists.
[02:18:47.641 --> 02:18:48.862]  Then get fired!
[02:18:57.563 --> 02:19:02.826]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me, and she had her digital textbook.
[02:19:02.826 --> 02:19:13.713]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table, and I clicked on iodine, and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or are mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough iodine.
[02:19:13.713 --> 02:19:17.875]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy, and it's not true.
[02:19:17.875 --> 02:19:20.597]  But, Dad, it's right here on the periodic table.
[02:19:20.597 --> 02:19:21.237]  When I click it,
[02:19:21.457 --> 02:19:22.678]  Saying exactly what you said.
[02:19:22.678 --> 02:19:24.280]  And I said, I know, honey.
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:28.764]  That's why I have you take a high-quality, nutraceutical-grade iodine.
[02:19:28.764 --> 02:19:31.306]  It's because it's why you're so vibrant.
[02:19:31.306 --> 02:19:32.627]  It's why you're so alive.
[02:19:32.627 --> 02:19:38.693]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age.
[02:19:38.693 --> 02:19:42.476]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself.
[02:19:42.476 --> 02:19:47.721]  To know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion, are mentally retarded.
[02:19:48.141 --> 02:19:50.885]  On the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[02:19:50.885 --> 02:19:53.087]  Research it and find out for yourself now!
[02:19:53.087 --> 02:20:00.116]  InfoWars.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:28.433 --> 02:20:31.019]  Whoa used to mean look out.
[02:20:31.019 --> 02:20:33.566]  Whoa means danger.
[02:20:37.199 --> 02:20:44.225]  You know, I'm a big fan of the Misfits, and usually you're not as big a fan of the Misfits or a band when they have another singer that comes along.
[02:20:44.225 --> 02:20:47.287]  But in the case, I mean, maybe a Van Halen the singer was better.
[02:20:47.287 --> 02:20:52.751]  Well, the same thing with the Misfits and Michael Graves, a good patriot, smart guy, official MichaelGraves.com.
[02:20:52.751 --> 02:21:02.259]  He's here in Austin, and he's had his sold-out shows canceled because of his evil support of Infowars and Alex Jones and Breitbart.
[02:21:02.259 --> 02:21:03.980]  But he's here to give us an update on how that went.
[02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:04.881]  He hadn't been here in about a year.
[02:21:06.221 --> 02:21:07.382]  Travels all over the world.
[02:21:07.382 --> 02:21:08.502]  Good to have you here, my friend.
[02:21:08.502 --> 02:21:09.622]  Good to be here, Alex.
[02:21:09.622 --> 02:21:11.443]  Thank you for having me back.
[02:21:11.443 --> 02:21:13.283]  Thanks for having the time to be here.
[02:21:13.283 --> 02:21:18.845]  And we're going to go to all the callers that are holding, like Jeff and Gary and all these folks.
[02:21:18.845 --> 02:21:19.745]  We'll get to you, too.
[02:21:19.745 --> 02:21:20.966]  We've got Joe Cilente.
[02:21:20.966 --> 02:21:23.767]  He'll take over about 15 minutes the next hour.
[02:21:23.767 --> 02:21:25.587]  But you're loaded for bear.
[02:21:25.587 --> 02:21:28.968]  You've got a lot to talk about and how this is all interconnected.
[02:21:28.968 --> 02:21:30.249]  We've also got a special report.
[02:21:30.249 --> 02:21:31.349]  Savannah Hernandez shot.
[02:21:31.909 --> 02:21:33.129]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:21:33.129 --> 02:21:34.130]  It's incredible.
[02:21:34.130 --> 02:21:34.890]  It's 10 minutes long.
[02:21:34.890 --> 02:21:37.591]  I'm only going to air two minutes of it in the last segment of this hour.
[02:21:37.591 --> 02:21:39.752]  But she went out and asked, is it OK to be white?
[02:21:39.752 --> 02:21:41.332]  And people said no.
[02:21:41.332 --> 02:21:44.953]  So, I mean, this is the brainwashing that's happening.
[02:21:44.953 --> 02:21:46.514]  We'll get to that.
[02:21:46.514 --> 02:21:49.255]  Also, where are the globalists operating with the homeless?
[02:21:49.915 --> 02:21:50.875]  Well, again, the Epstein
[02:22:16.966 --> 02:22:24.371]  The way that the Jeffrey Epstein suicide has hit the popular zeitgeist is amazing.
[02:22:24.371 --> 02:22:25.452]  You hear it everywhere.
[02:22:25.452 --> 02:22:31.156]  I hear it everywhere, every night, to the point where we're making, there's memes about it.
[02:22:31.156 --> 02:22:33.237]  It's funny, right?
[02:22:33.237 --> 02:22:45.845]  So to prepare for today, and I went to Infowars.com, and there's the report up about Roger Stone talking about Steve Bannon and yourself.
[02:22:47.126 --> 02:23:01.537]  He references and talks about Miles Kwok, who is this Chinese national who China is looking to expedite back to China for his crimes, right?
[02:23:01.537 --> 02:23:13.106]  And that ties together Steve Bannon and how Steve Bannon was basically infiltrating the Trump campaign for his own gain.
[02:23:13.106 --> 02:23:15.147]  And then I started to think about
[02:23:16.344 --> 02:23:17.685]  I don't
[02:23:35.373 --> 02:23:38.455]  Link to some sort of child... It's a total prepozoid!
[02:23:38.455 --> 02:23:39.896]  Have you seen the latest thing?
[02:23:39.896 --> 02:23:40.776]  A hundred percent.
[02:23:40.776 --> 02:23:44.198]  Where he says I represent pedophiles who are going to manage security clearances.
[02:23:44.198 --> 02:23:47.821]  And it's still up on Twitter for everybody to see.
[02:23:47.821 --> 02:23:48.721]  He's flaunting it.
[02:23:48.721 --> 02:24:04.250]  Now this guy started what's called Whistleblower Aid, which is a non-profit that the Trump administration took over in 2016 and went around and advertised for whistleblowers, people within the administration, to
[02:24:05.191 --> 02:24:09.957]  To basically spy and come out against the administration, right?
[02:24:09.957 --> 02:24:10.358]  No, you're right.
[02:24:10.358 --> 02:24:15.664]  He organized people that were inside of it to then go out and do what the so-called whistleblowers done.
[02:24:15.664 --> 02:24:19.469]  Say something that no of the witnesses or transcripts ever saw.
[02:24:19.469 --> 02:24:22.172]  And he's also connected to the James Madison Project?
[02:24:22.918 --> 02:24:38.981]  Which also on the board of the James Madison Project, that's connected to John Podesta, which is connected to the Center for American Progress, which is connected to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is connected to the ACLU, funded by George Soros.
[02:24:40.157 --> 02:24:44.059]  That's why the ACLU will not defend free speech.
[02:24:44.059 --> 02:24:47.260]  They got bought.
[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:48.580]  This isn't me making it up.
[02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:50.061]  It's an Aaron Klein report.
[02:24:50.061 --> 02:24:50.821]  They're facts.
[02:24:50.821 --> 02:24:53.922]  I didn't sit up last night and just analyze this.
[02:24:53.922 --> 02:25:04.667]  So within tax documents that were looked at in this report, you find out that the Open Society, which is George Soros' group, is funding all of this.
[02:25:05.447 --> 02:25:09.888]  Which then is connected to the United to Protect Democracy.
[02:25:09.888 --> 02:25:24.332]  United to Protect Democracy is a group that is filled with former top lawyers from the Obama administration, which does advocacy methods to oppose the Trump administration.
[02:25:25.317 --> 02:25:47.458]  So that's who this is, is George Soros, Hillary, and a bunch of globalists, and it turns out they had Kelly, turns out they had Tillerson, because these people are all scared, literally working for them, and then they brought in McMaster, they brought in Fiona Hill, they brought in all these people to fill up the administration all under Trump's nose, and now Bannon goes and testifies against Stone.
[02:25:48.258 --> 02:25:51.759]  Well, he didn't tell me he was talking to WikiLeaks or had it, but that he was trying to get it.
[02:25:51.759 --> 02:25:54.899]  Well, of course we were all trying to get it, and now Roger faced a certain present.
[02:25:54.899 --> 02:25:57.380]  So why is this all important to the impeachment?
[02:25:57.380 --> 02:25:58.540]  How does it tie in?
[02:25:58.540 --> 02:26:06.382]  Well, because numerous aspects of the whistleblower's claims relies on information that's tied to CrowdStrike.
[02:26:06.382 --> 02:26:10.843]  And then when you start to look at CrowdStrike and who they are, the FBI never
[02:26:12.347 --> 02:26:16.914]  Never investigated the DNC hack.
[02:26:16.914 --> 02:26:21.740]  It was CrowdStrike that investigated the hack, right?
[02:26:21.740 --> 02:26:22.361]  Because it wasn't.
[02:26:22.361 --> 02:26:24.003]  It was a download at the point.
[02:26:24.003 --> 02:26:24.744]  It was never that.
[02:26:25.706 --> 02:26:47.578]  And Roger Stone made a motion to suppress evidence in May for this very reason, that the DNC hack, it was questioning the legitimacy of the information offered by the prosecutors because the FBI didn't investigate, or they failed to investigate, or they just decided not to, and they relied on the information from CrowdStrike.
[02:26:48.615 --> 02:26:56.146]  Who found that Russian state players were to blame and gave the information to WikiLeaks.
[02:26:56.146 --> 02:26:59.731]  And that's where the whole Russiagate thing is coming from.
[02:26:59.731 --> 02:27:00.492]  Which is ridiculous.
[02:27:00.492 --> 02:27:04.918]  It was a giant consortium of patriots in the government that leaked that information.
[02:27:05.439 --> 02:27:07.160]  And I've had that from William, Benny, from everybody.
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:09.581]  It was downloaded inside the DNC.
[02:27:09.581 --> 02:27:15.003]  Other stuff was downloaded inside the National Security Council, inside the NSA, and inside the CIA.
[02:27:15.003 --> 02:27:19.764]  That's where all that stuff's coming from, because there are people in the government that don't like the deep state.
[02:27:19.764 --> 02:27:23.526]  There's a civil war in the government between them, pro-Americans and globalists.
[02:27:23.526 --> 02:27:29.368]  And the final straw was Obama giving the Office of Personnel Management hack, 22 million names, of the entire U.S.
[02:27:29.368 --> 02:27:31.849]  intelligence, their families, everybody, to the CHICOMS.
[02:27:32.449 --> 02:27:40.712]  So then, here I am, so it's starting to crystallize for me as you get all of this information.
[02:27:40.712 --> 02:27:55.737]  Then you start to see groups like CrowdStrike, you start to see the, you know, DNC and Adam Schiff who's tied to Ukraine, who's tied to the Atlantic Council.
[02:27:55.737 --> 02:27:58.458]  And then, so the Atlantic Council then pops up.
[02:27:59.258 --> 02:28:15.711]  The Atlantic Council is funded by and works with, in partnership with, wait for it, Burisma, Burisma Holdings, Google as well, Google Capital, $100 million funding drive, financed by CrowdStrike.
[02:28:15.711 --> 02:28:19.874]  Why do you think InfoWars and Alex Jones is under attack?
[02:28:19.874 --> 02:28:21.695]  Google, there's ties to...
[02:28:22.876 --> 02:28:29.699]  The Atlantic Council is former CIA from the left, and they admit, they go on congressional hearings and say, shut Alex Jones down.
[02:28:29.699 --> 02:28:31.040]  They're running it all.
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:31.420]  Absolutely.
[02:28:31.420 --> 02:28:37.743]  American citizens under CIA attack for simply supporting America being great.
[02:28:37.743 --> 02:28:41.125]  We'll be right back with our guest, Michael Graves, officialmichaelgraves.com.
[02:28:41.125 --> 02:28:44.106]  He is the former frontman with the misfits and a good patriot.
[02:28:44.106 --> 02:28:45.947]  And your phone calls, I promise, straight ahead.
[02:28:45.947 --> 02:28:50.289]  But yeah, we have globalists working with traitors inside the government to overthrow America.
[02:28:53.931 --> 02:28:58.494]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:58.494 --> 02:29:00.596]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:00.596 --> 02:29:02.317]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:02.317 --> 02:29:08.881]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:08.881 --> 02:29:13.965]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:13.965 --> 02:29:18.648]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:19.088 --> 02:29:22.210]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[02:29:44.760 --> 02:29:44.981]  That's 800-506-6740.
[02:29:44.981 --> 02:29:49.065]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.

[02:30:55.484 --> 02:30:57.646]  All of our bodies are different.
[02:30:57.646 --> 02:31:00.449]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[02:31:00.449 --> 02:31:03.452]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[02:31:03.452 --> 02:31:08.236]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something you don't know.
[02:31:08.236 --> 02:31:09.117]  But I'm here to tell you.
[02:31:10.203 --> 02:31:19.287]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life completely changes.
[02:31:19.287 --> 02:31:20.047]  I'm healthier.
[02:31:20.047 --> 02:31:21.387]  I have more energy.
[02:31:21.387 --> 02:31:22.208]  I lose weight.
[02:31:22.208 --> 02:31:22.988]  I look better.
[02:31:22.988 --> 02:31:24.549]  Everybody notices.
[02:31:24.549 --> 02:31:27.230]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit
[02:31:28.110 --> 02:31:31.833]  To take X2 Body's Ultimate Turmeric.
[02:31:31.833 --> 02:31:36.918]  I'm gonna commit to flush my gut out with the Gut Fusion from M4 Wars Life.
[02:31:36.918 --> 02:31:41.822]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[02:31:41.822 --> 02:31:47.207]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about, is Gut Fusion.
[02:31:47.207 --> 02:31:48.328]  Folks, check it out.
[02:31:48.328 --> 02:31:49.869]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:31:49.869 --> 02:31:51.251]  50% off right now.
[02:31:51.251 --> 02:31:52.792]  The sale's about to end.
[02:31:52.792 --> 02:31:53.853]  Gut Fusion, m4warsstore.com.
[02:31:55.214 --> 02:31:59.376]  The time has come to defy the Thought Police.
[02:31:59.376 --> 02:32:02.857]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[02:32:02.857 --> 02:32:11.821]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[02:32:13.180 --> 02:32:16.144]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[02:32:16.144 --> 02:32:22.591]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[02:32:22.591 --> 02:32:29.660]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[02:32:29.660 --> 02:32:32.223]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[02:32:32.843 --> 02:32:37.085]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[02:32:37.085 --> 02:32:40.986]  We have a it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap.
[02:32:40.986 --> 02:32:41.846]  It's black and white.
[02:32:41.846 --> 02:32:42.366]  Very nice.
[02:32:42.366 --> 02:32:43.827]  It has the okay symbol on it.
[02:32:43.827 --> 02:32:45.648]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[02:32:45.648 --> 02:32:47.648]  Infowars.com is on the back.
[02:32:47.648 --> 02:32:58.472]  Get yours today at infowarsstore.com and support free speech by supporting Infowars while having a great hat.
[02:32:58.472 --> 02:33:01.093]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.575 --> 02:33:23.507]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:34.983 --> 02:33:37.984]  It's definitely Hollywood Babylon, and now Hollywood is collapsing.
[02:33:37.984 --> 02:33:40.825]  We're just getting into how horrible the Pacific Northwest is, how bad L.A.
[02:33:40.825 --> 02:33:41.466]  is.
[02:33:41.466 --> 02:33:42.386]  I want to get to some clips of that.
[02:33:42.386 --> 02:33:43.426]  I want to get to some phone calls.
[02:33:43.426 --> 02:33:48.448]  We'll go to the next hour, but Michael Graves finishing up with this deep state coup.
[02:33:48.448 --> 02:33:54.531]  It's incredible how transparent it is, how fraudulent it is, and Lindsey Graham says it's going to be dead on arrival in the Senate.
[02:33:55.191 --> 02:33:59.212]  They're going to launch a bunch of other lies once they get up next to that vote.
[02:33:59.212 --> 02:34:02.454]  And then they're going to launch a bunch of other lies when the Senate's having its trial.
[02:34:02.454 --> 02:34:06.855]  We're about to see their full vomiting of propaganda and disinfo.
[02:34:06.855 --> 02:34:08.576]  And I'm not saying they're going to win.
[02:34:08.576 --> 02:34:12.517]  I'm just saying people that think it's in the bag, I think are really underestimating.
[02:34:12.517 --> 02:34:15.258]  Remember folks, I'm the guy that told you Trump was going to win for sure.
[02:34:15.258 --> 02:34:16.539]  And my gut told me that.
[02:34:16.539 --> 02:34:19.920]  I'm telling you it's not in the bag right now.
[02:34:19.920 --> 02:34:20.300]  What do you think?
[02:34:23.228 --> 02:34:23.928]  I agree with you.
[02:34:23.928 --> 02:34:28.251]  I agree with you 100% that it's not in the bag.
[02:34:28.251 --> 02:34:38.738]  However, like you always say, and people call up this show and they ask what can they do, and it's sort of the obvious about supporting the broadcast and buying the products.
[02:34:38.738 --> 02:34:40.799]  It's exactly what I just did.
[02:34:40.799 --> 02:34:42.300]  I'm a punk rock musician, right?
[02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:43.501]  I'm a musician.
[02:34:43.501 --> 02:34:48.004]  I maybe spent two, three hours last night researching, writing my notes.
[02:34:48.004 --> 02:34:51.606]  The hotel wouldn't let me print out all the things I wanted to print out, so I wrote them down.
[02:34:52.266 --> 02:35:03.337]  And just with a little bit of thought and a little bit of research, you can put this whole piece, this whole puzzle together.
[02:35:03.337 --> 02:35:06.941]  And then you can talk to other people as well.
[02:35:07.381 --> 02:35:15.385]  Again, I'll reach out to, I know that there's a lot of musicians, I know that there's a lot of artists out there that listen to this broadcast.
[02:35:15.385 --> 02:35:30.953]  I wear the shirts, I'm out there every single day, almost 40-something cities, 55 cities on the tour that I'm doing, and people come up to me all the time, Alex, and they say, nice shirt, I listen to Infowars, and the question back is, well, what are you doing?
[02:35:30.953 --> 02:35:36.916]  You have to do something, and... They have to be leaders, I'm not bitching at people, it's just, Alex Jones is out there, folks.
[02:35:37.236 --> 02:35:40.358]  The system is afraid of the show because the focal point, they're afraid of you.
[02:35:40.358 --> 02:35:42.100]  Everybody's got to start speaking out.
[02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:43.220]  They've got to take action.
[02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:48.805]  All they have is holding on to the narrative and trying to control the narrative.
[02:35:48.805 --> 02:35:51.386]  The president keeps saying witch hunt.
[02:35:51.386 --> 02:35:59.973]  We have to remember the lessons of the Salem witch trials in the 1600s, the lack of judicial regulation, the controlling of the narrative.
[02:36:00.433 --> 02:36:05.675]  And at the end of that, there were people that were dead and there were people that were in prison.
[02:36:05.675 --> 02:36:21.640]  And it's that spirit within what happened in the 1600s that propelled us forward, that eventually our forefathers and the Constitution and the birthing of this country was born through, and that's why... Because there was judicial tyranny going on all over the colonies.
[02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:23.002]  All over the place.
[02:36:23.002 --> 02:36:28.429]  And there was the controlling of the narrative and the ignorance of the people that were involved in that.
[02:36:28.429 --> 02:36:32.375]  That is what led to such a horrible outcome.
[02:36:32.375 --> 02:36:36.401]  And the left is trying to create a witch trials hysteria.
[02:36:37.545 --> 02:36:39.567]  A hundred percent, they absolutely are.
[02:36:39.567 --> 02:36:44.130]  I've seen them failing, except they've got a lowest common denominator that buys into it.
[02:36:44.130 --> 02:36:50.015]  You were talking about them, what you've seen in Los Angeles, what you're witnessing all over the, particularly the West Coast.
[02:36:50.015 --> 02:37:00.843]  Right, so whether it's Antifa or it's the environmental activists, you're talking about the supporters of the New Green Deal, the AOC people.
[02:37:01.784 --> 02:37:05.406]  They are convinced that they are fighting real Nazis.
[02:37:05.406 --> 02:37:15.891]  They are convinced of all the lies that are put out through the media and these crazy people that you see on screen there.
[02:37:17.149 --> 02:37:25.596]  It's another thing that I recognize with the anonymity of the whistleblowers and the anonymity of all these people that hide behind.
[02:37:25.596 --> 02:37:26.977]  Everybody covers their face.
[02:37:26.977 --> 02:37:32.542]  Nobody wants to stand up and actually have themselves be known.
[02:37:32.542 --> 02:37:34.063]  These people are violent.
[02:37:34.063 --> 02:37:35.224]  They are ignorant.
[02:37:35.224 --> 02:37:36.565]  They don't understand.
[02:37:38.207 --> 02:37:43.290]  The founding of this country, what it was built on, they don't understand history.
[02:37:43.290 --> 02:37:45.172]  They are looking into their cell phones.
[02:37:45.172 --> 02:37:46.913]  They are getting the information.
[02:37:46.913 --> 02:37:48.995]  They're mesmerized.
[02:37:48.995 --> 02:37:49.655]  100%.
[02:37:49.655 --> 02:37:56.420]  I know that we don't necessarily have time to get into the social, the big social engineering part of all this.
[02:37:56.420 --> 02:38:02.425]  I know that obviously here on the broadcast you've talked about the Tavistock Institute.
[02:38:02.905 --> 02:38:03.826]  We're good to go.
[02:38:24.906 --> 02:38:28.150]  A crowd of people like that, where do those people come from?
[02:38:28.150 --> 02:38:35.920]  And ladies and gentlemen, they are, you just saw them on the TV, the people that will look over these camps if this goes through the way that...
[02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:44.497]  That the left, the progressives, all the Soros people are hoping that it goes through.
[02:38:44.497 --> 02:38:48.221]  They're going to come for us all and it's those people right there.
[02:38:48.221 --> 02:38:49.322]  And they say they are too.
[02:38:49.322 --> 02:38:50.884]  That's what's really creepy about it.
[02:38:50.884 --> 02:38:59.632]  The type of people that would eat Owen Schroeder's microphone windscreen are going to be looking over and have the hate
[02:39:00.333 --> 02:39:21.522]  In their hearts because they are disconnected from God and again I love how you've become more spiritual on the broadcast and allowing that to flow through on this broadcast and again part of my notes I wanted to bring up again that it's important to understand that
[02:39:23.323 --> 02:39:33.586]  We're not, at the end of the day, wrestling with human forces and that it's a supernatural force.
[02:39:33.586 --> 02:39:38.488]  And it's going to get more and more obvious, all the Kim trailing and the AI and the anti-human future.
[02:39:38.488 --> 02:39:44.650]  This headline, Mainstream News, Inside Amazon's Plan for Alexa to Run Our Entire Lives.
[02:39:44.650 --> 02:39:46.370]  It's all there.
[02:39:46.370 --> 02:39:47.691]  This is a takeover.
[02:39:48.411 --> 02:39:49.552]  And humanity has to decide.
[02:39:49.552 --> 02:39:53.594]  Do we want to be human and continue on and grow normally the way God has planned?
[02:39:53.594 --> 02:40:00.637]  Or do we want somebody else to come through and tell us, give up our humanity, merge with machines, and be their slaves?
[02:40:00.637 --> 02:40:02.698]  I mean, this is really, this is happening.
[02:40:02.698 --> 02:40:03.758]  We're on a planet, folks.
[02:40:03.758 --> 02:40:05.239]  It's not a science fiction movie.
[02:40:05.239 --> 02:40:07.280]  It's the real world.
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:08.261]  I want to go to some calls.
[02:40:08.261 --> 02:40:10.282]  We'll be able to continue into the next hour.
[02:40:10.282 --> 02:40:12.523]  This is all important.
[02:40:12.523 --> 02:40:13.483]  And I've got some clips.
[02:40:13.483 --> 02:40:14.804]  Savannah Hernandez went out to UT.
[02:40:16.510 --> 02:40:22.032]  This last weekend, and because there's all over the news, it's like, is it okay to be white?
[02:40:22.032 --> 02:40:22.992]  White supremacist?
[02:40:22.992 --> 02:40:24.353]  The FBI is investigating.
[02:40:24.353 --> 02:40:26.473]  Because there's all this thing that white people are evil.
[02:40:26.473 --> 02:40:29.294]  Well, that's the universities, that's the left trying to create a race war.
[02:40:29.294 --> 02:40:31.375]  So of course it's okay to be any color.
[02:40:31.375 --> 02:40:33.536]  But we're going to play some of that coming back next segment.
[02:40:33.536 --> 02:40:35.156]  Right now, let's go to a caller.
[02:40:35.156 --> 02:40:39.417]  Let's go to Gary, who's been on the longest, and James, and Elijah, and Jeff, and many others.
[02:40:39.417 --> 02:40:40.238]  Gary, thanks for holding.
[02:40:40.238 --> 02:40:41.398]  You're on the air.
[02:40:41.398 --> 02:40:43.819]  What do you think Trump should do to stop this attempted takeover?
[02:40:46.136 --> 02:40:47.216]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:40:47.216 --> 02:40:49.837]  I'm good, brother.
[02:40:49.837 --> 02:40:52.337]  Listen, I want to tell you, you're like Trump.
[02:40:52.337 --> 02:41:02.020]  The times get tough, your products get better, you work harder, you get more focused, and he does the same thing.
[02:41:02.020 --> 02:41:04.580]  In regards to Trump, here's what I think.
[02:41:04.580 --> 02:41:13.162]  I think that no man's an island, and what's getting me today is always new news, is this guy Lindsey Graham.
[02:41:14.172 --> 02:41:14.592]  Unbelievable.
[02:41:14.592 --> 02:41:19.154]  That means turn off America's energy when nobody else has to make the cuts.
[02:41:19.154 --> 02:41:21.095]  That's what that is.
[02:41:21.095 --> 02:41:21.535]  That's warfare.
[02:41:42.091 --> 02:41:43.331]  It's what I'm saying.
[02:41:43.331 --> 02:41:50.933]  When they either come up with crazy statements or they do something that's so abnormal, you gotta say to yourself, what is going on?
[02:41:50.933 --> 02:41:56.034]  Well remember, Lindsey Graham said a few weeks ago they'd never vote to start formal impeachment in the House.
[02:41:56.034 --> 02:41:58.474]  They did!
[02:41:58.474 --> 02:41:59.114]  Right.
[02:41:59.114 --> 02:42:04.536]  So he's like the last minute in regards to all the time they put into healthcare.
[02:42:04.536 --> 02:42:11.757]  That guy came by, his buddy, and he votes no on healthcare at the last minute and costs the American people trillions of dollars.
[02:42:12.546 --> 02:42:18.892]  Well, in regards to this impeachment, if we're going to put, we know the Democrats are bad, we know there's all this stuff.
[02:42:18.892 --> 02:42:21.194]  It's the Republicans that worry me.
[02:42:21.194 --> 02:42:21.794]  Yes.
[02:42:21.794 --> 02:42:25.097]  It's the deals that the Republicans have made.
[02:42:25.097 --> 02:42:26.158]  It's what's going on.
[02:42:26.158 --> 02:42:28.880]  It's, it's always the guy that's on your side.
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:33.504]  You can sit there and get ready for the, for the, for the hordes that are in front of you.
[02:42:33.504 --> 02:42:36.427]  But if your friend that's behind you, that's supposed to have you six,
[02:42:37.091 --> 02:42:40.434]  Who you have, you know, faith in is going to get you from behind.
[02:42:40.434 --> 02:42:41.475]  You're in a lot of trouble.
[02:42:56.421 --> 02:43:01.682]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me, and she had her digital textbook.
[02:43:01.682 --> 02:43:12.566]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table, and I clicked on iodine, and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough iodine.
[02:43:12.566 --> 02:43:16.728]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy, and it's not true.
[02:43:16.728 --> 02:43:21.849]  But, Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what you said.
[02:43:21.849 --> 02:43:23.150]  And I said, I know, honey.
[02:43:23.150 --> 02:43:23.950]  That's why I have
[02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:24.410]  Infowars.com.
[02:43:55.607 --> 02:43:59.291]  Host asked me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[02:43:59.291 --> 02:44:07.280]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:09.862]  It's just that simple.
[02:44:09.862 --> 02:44:16.269]  X3 is the deep-earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[02:44:16.269 --> 02:44:16.790]  Others like
[02:44:17.350 --> 02:44:19.452]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[02:44:19.452 --> 02:44:20.172]  Get both.
[02:44:20.172 --> 02:44:21.633]  They're both great for you.
[02:44:21.633 --> 02:44:26.056]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[02:44:26.056 --> 02:44:28.258]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[02:44:28.258 --> 02:44:29.618]  That's why I harp on it.
[02:44:29.618 --> 02:44:33.781]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[02:44:33.781 --> 02:44:35.943]  Lower IQ makes you sluggish.
[02:44:35.943 --> 02:44:37.043]  You don't live as long.
[02:44:37.043 --> 02:44:37.804]  It's simple.
[02:44:37.804 --> 02:44:42.027]  Get your high-quality iodine at InfoWarsTore.com and help fund the InfoWar.
[02:44:42.367 --> 02:44:44.490]  InfowarStore.com.
[02:44:44.490 --> 02:44:47.173]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[02:44:47.173 --> 02:44:48.995]  It's the iodine challenge.
[02:44:48.995 --> 02:44:55.424]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[02:44:55.424 --> 02:44:58.407]  The time has come to defy the Thought Police.
[02:44:59.588 --> 02:45:03.070]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[02:45:03.070 --> 02:45:12.015]  They're waging war on communication itself, as the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[02:45:13.385 --> 02:45:16.366]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[02:45:16.366 --> 02:45:22.788]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[02:45:22.788 --> 02:45:29.410]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[02:45:29.850 --> 02:45:33.051]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[02:45:33.051 --> 02:45:37.292]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[02:45:37.292 --> 02:45:41.212]  We have a it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap.
[02:45:41.212 --> 02:45:42.053]  It's black and white.
[02:45:42.053 --> 02:45:42.553]  Very nice.
[02:45:42.553 --> 02:45:44.033]  It has the okay symbol on it.
[02:45:44.033 --> 02:45:45.853]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[02:45:45.853 --> 02:45:47.854]  Infowars.com is on the back.
[02:45:47.854 --> 02:45:53.815]  Get yours today at infowarsstore.com and support free speech by supporting InfoWars while having a great hat.
[02:45:56.479 --> 02:46:11.730]  The Witch Queen of the Deep State lost the 2016 election because she was arrogant, and the corporate whores in the media busily covering up her giant pedophile and blackmail rings thought that her victory was assured.
[02:46:11.730 --> 02:46:12.531]  Now that the
[02:46:12.631 --> 02:46:14.312]  The enemy lost that election.
[02:46:14.312 --> 02:46:18.373]  They are awake and throwing everything they've got at us.
[02:46:18.373 --> 02:46:23.915]  And conservatives and nationalists and Christians and patriots, many of them, are asleep thinking 2020's in the bag.
[02:46:23.915 --> 02:46:26.476]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost Kentucky governorship.
[02:46:26.476 --> 02:46:30.377]  We just lost the Virginia Statehouse the first time in 30 years.
[02:46:30.377 --> 02:46:31.578]  This is serious.
[02:46:31.578 --> 02:46:35.179]  We can win again and secure the gains we've gotten.
[02:46:35.179 --> 02:46:37.080]  Or we can see it all wash down the drain.
[02:46:37.600 --> 02:46:45.367]  Whatever you do, get more politically activated than you ever have, and spread the live links at man.video and infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:46:45.367 --> 02:46:53.495]  If you want to defeat the deep state and the globalists, then get fired up!
[02:46:53.495 --> 02:46:58.019]  Man.Video!
[02:46:58.019 --> 02:47:00.682]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:11.638 --> 02:47:17.881]  Michael Graves, a patriot, also former lead man with the Misfits, has his own great band today, OfficialMichaelGraves.com.
[02:47:17.881 --> 02:47:24.725]  He just told me tonight, just with the crew, at a little restaurant I've been to before called Patsy's.
[02:47:24.725 --> 02:47:27.587]  They got great chicken fried steaks, at least the last time I ate there a few years ago.
[02:47:27.587 --> 02:47:30.888]  He'll be there playing acoustic guitar tonight at Patsy's.
[02:47:30.888 --> 02:47:33.069]  I guess that's off Ben White South or 290.
[02:47:34.690 --> 02:47:36.192]  South in Austin, Texas.
[02:47:36.192 --> 02:47:38.053]  So look for that this evening over there.
[02:47:38.053 --> 02:47:42.637]  I guess with some of the crew they're gonna shoot some video and he'll also be on the war room coming up today.
[02:47:42.637 --> 02:47:43.717]  We're trying to get through your calls.
[02:47:43.717 --> 02:47:48.121]  He's got a lot more to add and I've got a lot to add and I've got a few reports I want to get to.
[02:47:48.121 --> 02:47:50.963]  But let's comment on what the last caller said, Michael.
[02:47:52.540 --> 02:47:53.360]  That's absolutely true.
[02:47:53.360 --> 02:47:57.722]  As Cicero said, it's not the enemy that openly has the banner at your gate.
[02:47:57.722 --> 02:47:59.343]  You can mobilize against that.
[02:47:59.343 --> 02:48:05.345]  If Rome's gonna fall, and America's like the modern Rome, make no mistake, we're as close to it as anything ever has been.
[02:48:05.345 --> 02:48:06.326]  It's the enemy within.
[02:48:06.326 --> 02:48:07.146]  It's the traitor.
[02:48:07.146 --> 02:48:09.667]  They're the plague.
[02:48:09.667 --> 02:48:09.927]  100%.
[02:48:09.927 --> 02:48:12.168]  It's from the inside.
[02:48:12.168 --> 02:48:18.991]  It's internal, and that is why it's important to continue to pay attention and not trust
[02:48:20.391 --> 02:48:30.554]  That caller was just talking about Lindsey Graham and not trusting these elected officials as far as we can throw them.
[02:48:30.554 --> 02:48:38.056]  The endgame here is to remove Trump, whether it's by impeachment, whether it's by assassination.
[02:48:38.056 --> 02:48:41.297]  The endgame, and it doesn't matter how they get to that endgame.
[02:48:41.297 --> 02:48:42.818]  They need to discredit the Liberty Movement.
[02:48:43.697 --> 02:48:46.139]  They need to discredit the Liberty Movement.
[02:48:46.139 --> 02:48:49.002]  Remember what Hillary Clinton said.
[02:48:49.002 --> 02:48:51.063]  Remember what she called us.
[02:48:51.063 --> 02:48:52.204]  Irredeemable.
[02:48:52.204 --> 02:48:53.165]  Deplorables.
[02:48:53.165 --> 02:48:58.130]  When you look up irredeemable, the definition of irredeemable is not a good thing.
[02:48:58.130 --> 02:48:59.731]  She said that too, you're right.
[02:48:59.731 --> 02:49:01.392]  And I actually looked it up.
[02:49:01.392 --> 02:49:04.275]  It means worthless crap, no value, can't fix it, get rid of it.
[02:49:04.435 --> 02:49:08.561]  Deserving strong condemnation, shockingly bad in quality.
[02:49:08.561 --> 02:49:12.207]  We were talking about Auschwitz, we were talking about camps before.
[02:49:12.207 --> 02:49:18.356]  That was signaling to us what's going to happen when somebody like Hillary Clinton
[02:49:19.426 --> 02:49:21.547]  And then people ask, why is D.C.
[02:49:21.547 --> 02:49:22.708]  so cowardly?
[02:49:42.005 --> 02:49:46.088]  The military is great, but once you get up to generals, because they were picked because they're yes-men.
[02:49:46.088 --> 02:49:47.990]  They were picked because they're duplicitous.
[02:49:47.990 --> 02:49:56.477]  And now we know that Roger Stone and Mike Cernovich were right with their sources here on air that made them so mad that we named who the globalists were, who they were bringing in.
[02:49:56.477 --> 02:49:57.438]  It was dead on!
[02:49:58.297 --> 02:50:00.499]  Roger Stone is being railroaded again.
[02:50:00.499 --> 02:50:01.960]  There's another canary in the coal mine.
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:04.882]  What's happening to Roger Stone?
[02:50:04.882 --> 02:50:08.244]  I read a lot about World War II.
[02:50:08.244 --> 02:50:10.586]  I've read a lot about the death camps.
[02:50:10.586 --> 02:50:20.213]  And one of the things that I find when you read about that history, when you read about the people that were involved in that, it's always the same thing.
[02:50:20.213 --> 02:50:25.277]  The people in these communities, in the Jewish communities that were sort of far removed from it, were always saying,
[02:50:25.817 --> 02:50:32.242]  Well you know we heard about it and we didn't really think it was a big deal and then it got a little bit worse and then we got concerned.
[02:50:32.242 --> 02:50:36.146]  Next thing you know they were on a train headed to a death camp.
[02:50:36.146 --> 02:50:37.306]  Because George Soros...
[02:50:38.797 --> 02:50:44.621]  And then back to these Antifa kids, again, in what I do for a living, we were talking about before, I'm in these venues, I see these bands.
[02:51:01.772 --> 02:51:08.159]  You've always been a real anti-fascist, and what is it like to see them literally working for a former Nazi collaborator calling you a Nazi?
[02:51:08.159 --> 02:51:11.042]  I started my professional career in 1994-1995.
[02:51:11.042 --> 02:51:16.647]  It was the end of the punks and the real punk rock skinhead wars.
[02:51:16.647 --> 02:51:20.511]  I knew and was part of what were called the Sharpies, right?
[02:51:20.511 --> 02:51:20.972]  They were real
[02:51:22.273 --> 02:51:25.495]  They were nationalists before the freedom movement.
[02:51:25.495 --> 02:51:28.657]  It started in the punk rock, in the hardcore community.
[02:51:28.657 --> 02:51:30.078]  We loved America.
[02:51:30.078 --> 02:51:34.440]  A lot of the guys that I knew went on to join the military because they loved their country.
[02:51:34.440 --> 02:51:41.284]  They wanted to have families and they were actually fighting the real white supremacists.
[02:51:41.284 --> 02:51:45.366]  These bonehead, meathead guys that hated everything.
[02:51:45.366 --> 02:51:46.507]  They hated gays.
[02:51:46.507 --> 02:51:48.088]  They hated Jews.
[02:51:48.088 --> 02:51:51.050]  They hated everybody and they had made no qualms about it.
[02:51:52.199 --> 02:52:03.195]  And that movement, that white supremacist movement seems to have morphed into this Antifa movement.
[02:52:03.195 --> 02:52:06.640]  It's shapeshifted into the Antifa movement.
[02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:08.082]  It's really just an excuse to be nasty.
[02:52:08.965 --> 02:52:11.867]  It really is, and to be disgusting and to be deplorable.
[02:52:11.867 --> 02:52:33.479]  Look at these... Back, again, when I started and I've been in enough fights and skirmishes, you know, back in the day, if there was going to be a fight, you know, two guys would go outside and they would fight, they would look at each other, their faces would be bare, and they would do what they needed to do and go away.
[02:52:33.479 --> 02:52:36.821]  Would you say that Punk Rock was more nationalistic or right-wing?
[02:52:37.421 --> 02:52:39.382]  Rejected the skinheads trying to take it over or whatever?
[02:52:39.382 --> 02:52:44.763]  Because I mean, I would say even before you were there, wouldn't you describe Glenn Danzig as kind of right-wing and nationalist?
[02:52:44.763 --> 02:52:45.603]  I think so, yeah.
[02:52:45.603 --> 02:53:01.407]  Well, at least I know that Glenn Danzig now certainly is awake and he understands from the interviews that I've seen and things that he's said, statements that he's made, that he's awake and he understands what the left is and what's happening.
[02:53:01.407 --> 02:53:04.388]  Again, he's been in the game long enough to remember
[02:53:05.248 --> 02:53:10.834]  The what came down on him and the rock music industry.
[02:53:10.834 --> 02:53:11.315]  The censorship.
[02:53:11.315 --> 02:53:13.597]  The censorship, yes, yes.
[02:53:13.597 --> 02:53:15.800]  And Tipper Gore had nothing on the left today.
[02:53:15.800 --> 02:53:22.267]  Yeah, but punk rock has always overlapped with left-wing politics.
[02:53:22.267 --> 02:53:23.949]  That's what I'm saying, I'm saying that more
[02:53:24.629 --> 02:53:27.752]  The Misfits version was more pro-military and stuff like that.
[02:53:27.752 --> 02:53:45.966]  Yes, yeah, when you really dig into Glenn Danzig's lyrics, at least what I get from, again, Hollywood Babylon, if you know anything about what Babylon is and what it was and what it represents, it was synonymous with evil, an evil, horrible system.
[02:53:45.966 --> 02:53:50.369]  You get a sense that, yes, music like Glenn was making was definitely nationalistic.
[02:53:50.369 --> 02:53:52.051]  Speaking of horrible and evil,
[02:53:52.978 --> 02:53:55.759]  I want to play just two minutes of the Savannah Hernandez report.
[02:53:55.759 --> 02:53:57.460]  The full thing is so important.
[02:53:57.460 --> 02:54:00.041]  I posted it to the live show feed today.
[02:54:00.041 --> 02:54:03.283]  Nikki Haley reveals attempted sabotage against America and President Trump.
[02:54:03.283 --> 02:54:05.804]  I want to play this, get your take on it, and then go back to phone calls.
[02:54:05.804 --> 02:54:09.086]  But imagine Martin Luther King just taught what Christians already knew.
[02:54:09.086 --> 02:54:09.506]  Everybody
[02:54:10.046 --> 02:54:10.246]  I think?
[02:54:32.481 --> 02:54:34.082]  This, it's not okay to be white.
[02:54:34.082 --> 02:54:36.144]  Whoever came up with the idea, I guess 4chan did, is smart.
[02:54:36.144 --> 02:54:39.606]  Because people say, no, it is bad, and whites are inherently bad.
[02:54:39.606 --> 02:54:46.171]  And most of the people she talked to at UT, who were white, said, yes, being white is not okay, and it's bad to put those up.
[02:54:46.171 --> 02:54:49.033]  Now she talked to black folks, most of them are like, no, it's okay to be white.
[02:54:49.033 --> 02:54:50.254]  They get that.
[02:54:50.254 --> 02:54:54.717]  It's just crazy how the left's trying to sell this idea that is true racism.
[02:54:54.717 --> 02:54:55.738]  Here it is.
[02:54:55.738 --> 02:54:58.940]  This poster has been put up around universities all over America.
[02:54:58.940 --> 02:55:00.261]  It's okay to be white.
[02:55:00.261 --> 02:55:01.182]  What do y'all think about that?
[02:55:02.173 --> 02:55:06.514]  I mean, we have a lot of privileges as white individuals, so, like... No, we don't.
[02:55:06.514 --> 02:55:10.455]  Like, be proud, do your own thing, but I don't think, like, boasting that s*** is necessary.
[02:55:10.455 --> 02:55:11.295]  I'm not sure.
[02:55:11.295 --> 02:55:17.297]  It's... I would probably resent that group, or, like, the people that were putting it up.
[02:55:17.297 --> 02:55:19.457]  It's like saying you're the new royalty if you're white.
[02:55:19.457 --> 02:55:20.937]  Because I don't think it's necessary.
[02:55:20.937 --> 02:55:21.037]  What?
[02:55:21.037 --> 02:55:25.919]  Sanders says no whites are poor.
[02:55:25.919 --> 02:55:31.620]  I agree with you, although... I feel that if that's, like,
[02:55:32.697 --> 02:55:37.021]  If that's their pride, then I think it's fine for them to do that.
[02:55:37.021 --> 02:55:38.302]  Just like everyone else.
[02:55:38.302 --> 02:55:39.323]  What do you guys think about it?
[02:55:39.323 --> 02:55:42.645]  How would you feel if you saw it popping up at UT?
[02:55:42.645 --> 02:55:44.747]  I mean, obviously it's not good.
[02:55:44.747 --> 02:55:45.588]  How come?
[02:55:45.588 --> 02:55:46.488]  Because that's pretty, right?
[02:55:46.488 --> 02:55:46.969]  I mean...
[02:55:49.107 --> 02:55:50.628]  It's pretty racist, I guess.
[02:55:50.628 --> 02:55:52.609]  It just makes me feel weird.
[02:55:52.609 --> 02:55:54.551]  Yeah, it does make me feel weird.
[02:55:54.551 --> 02:55:56.572]  I'm not sure how I would feel.
[02:55:56.572 --> 02:56:03.457]  I guess the sentiment is in the right place, but I don't think it's necessary to put up posters like that.
[02:56:03.457 --> 02:56:15.284]  I feel like it's a given in any society that it is okay to be white, and there's no repercussions to being white, or any additional difficulties that they have to face.
[02:56:15.284 --> 02:56:16.145]  I'd be disappointed.
[02:56:18.447 --> 02:56:22.688]  Uh, because it's, uh... I don't know.
[02:56:22.688 --> 02:56:25.609]  It infers that white people are oppressed in some way, and we are not.
[02:56:25.609 --> 02:56:26.989]  There's white supremacists everywhere.
[02:56:26.989 --> 02:56:28.409]  Well, they're everywhere!
[02:56:28.409 --> 02:56:31.250]  They're everywhere.
[02:56:31.250 --> 02:56:33.230]  Do you think that this phrase should be banned?
[02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:34.050]  It's hard for them to talk.
[02:56:34.050 --> 02:56:42.332]  Do you think that if people are posting this sign or saying this phrase around Trump, that they should be punished for that?
[02:56:42.332 --> 02:56:42.592]  Yes.
[02:56:43.812 --> 02:56:52.455]  Well, uh, I believe in the First Amendment, so like, if it's not, like, hate speech, but they're also, like... Yeah, they all use these buzzwords.
[02:56:52.455 --> 02:56:54.136]  That's what the majority of millennials say.
[02:56:54.136 --> 02:56:56.837]  Oh, we believe in the First Amendment, but if something's hurtful, arrest you.
[02:56:56.837 --> 02:57:02.719]  It's just like, blah, blah, blah, First Amendment, blah, blah, hate speech, blah, blah, white supremacists.
[02:57:02.719 --> 02:57:04.359]  Get some kind of rise out of them.
[02:57:04.359 --> 02:57:06.000]  Yeah, that's a good shit.
[02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:06.740]  I'm not sure if it...
[02:57:07.943 --> 02:57:11.211]  Go so far as to be qualified for hate speech, but... What is hate speech?
[02:57:11.211 --> 02:57:12.595]  It's a leftist term for banning speech.
[02:57:12.595 --> 02:57:13.638]  We're going to come back with your calls.
[02:57:14.617 --> 02:57:15.677]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:15.677 --> 02:57:20.219]  That full video is up on InfoWars.com and banned on video, and it needs to get out there.
[02:57:20.219 --> 02:57:23.240]  And I'm going to go out and do a prove-me-wrong.
[02:57:23.240 --> 02:57:26.261]  I did the Jeff Gereff's team was murdered, prove-me-wrong deal.
[02:57:26.261 --> 02:57:28.642]  We've got signs printed up, it's okay to be white.
[02:57:28.642 --> 02:57:36.165]  Of course, on either side of them, it's okay to be black or brown, but you watch, folks are going to flip out because that's the brainwashing that's going on.
[02:57:36.165 --> 02:57:40.346]  So we have to force this debate out there because of what these people have been taught.
[02:57:40.346 --> 02:57:41.847]  We'll be right back with our number four.
[02:57:44.005 --> 02:57:45.586]  Alex Jones.
[02:57:45.586 --> 02:57:47.888]  Stop the iodine conspiracy.
[02:57:47.888 --> 02:57:49.590]  Wake up the world challenge.

[02:57:59.858 --> 02:58:05.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, X2 and X3 are two amazing formulas of iodine.

[02:58:07.420 --> 02:58:09.421]  See which one works best for you.
[02:58:09.421 --> 02:58:13.702]  Bio-True Selenium from the mustard seed supercharges all of it.
[02:58:13.702 --> 02:58:16.703]  We have this best deal ever on these products.

[02:58:23.925 --> 02:58:28.891]  The Everything Must Go Super sale is the main sale, and this sale is part of that sale.
[02:58:28.891 --> 02:58:31.594]  It's going to have to end by early next week.

[02:58:41.345 --> 02:58:43.568]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:45.720 --> 02:58:47.883]  All of our bodies are different.
[02:58:47.883 --> 02:58:50.686]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[02:58:50.686 --> 02:58:53.690]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[02:58:53.690 --> 02:58:59.357]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something you don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[02:59:00.439 --> 02:59:09.623]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life completely changes.
[02:59:09.623 --> 02:59:10.283]  I'm healthier.
[02:59:10.283 --> 02:59:11.623]  I have more energy.
[02:59:11.623 --> 02:59:12.444]  I lose weight.
[02:59:12.444 --> 02:59:13.244]  I look better.
[02:59:13.244 --> 02:59:14.785]  Everybody notices.
[02:59:14.785 --> 02:59:17.466]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit
[02:59:18.346 --> 02:59:22.089]  To take X2 Body's Ultimate Turmeric.
[02:59:22.089 --> 02:59:27.153]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the Gut Fusion from InfoWars Life.
[02:59:27.153 --> 02:59:32.056]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[02:59:32.056 --> 02:59:37.460]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use that I don't talk enough about is Gut Fusion.

[02:59:38.561 --> 02:59:40.503]  There's nothing else like it.

[02:59:41.483 --> 02:59:43.025]  The sale's about to end.

[02:59:43.645 --> 02:59:44.606]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:48.028 --> 02:59:50.644]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.327 --> 03:00:14.092]  We walk the streets at night.
[03:00:14.092 --> 03:00:16.235]  We go where we go down.
[03:00:16.235 --> 03:00:19.661]  They pick up every movement.
[03:00:19.661 --> 03:00:21.564]  They pick up every loser.
[03:00:21.564 --> 03:00:24.229]  We're dead in our speeches.
[03:00:24.229 --> 03:00:25.551]  You think they really care?
[03:00:26.448 --> 03:00:32.554]  Alright folks, we are back live here playing some previous misfits, not his misfits, which is just as good.
[03:00:32.554 --> 03:00:36.738]  Which you never really, hardly ever see, is where the next singer in a band is just as good.
[03:00:36.738 --> 03:00:44.285]  Different style, but just as good as the Eagles' dare that it's not a family-friendly track, even though that was in the computer in there.
[03:00:44.285 --> 03:00:46.507]  But right now, probably not making it.
[03:00:46.667 --> 03:00:47.267]  Hi, how are you doing Alex?
[03:00:47.267 --> 03:00:48.688]  How are you guys doing over there?
[03:01:17.247 --> 03:01:18.488]  Good.
[03:01:18.488 --> 03:01:31.033]  Listen, okay, so the thing that Trump can do, I'll tell you this, he could go push as hard as they are pushing against him by exposing the whistleblower's lawyer, giving clearances to guys who had childborn.
[03:01:31.033 --> 03:01:34.455]  I mean, that right there blows it all up.
[03:01:34.455 --> 03:01:36.856]  Another thing is he could also push on for the Kentucky.
[03:01:37.849 --> 03:01:40.370]  I agree.
[03:01:40.370 --> 03:01:49.134]  Trump should go after the lawyer for the fake whistleblower, the CIA coup, who literally just, you can't, just everywhere is.
[03:01:49.134 --> 03:01:51.975]  I like Epstein when he's arrested.
[03:01:51.975 --> 03:01:54.997]  I love to go to theme parks alone and foes them with kids.
[03:01:54.997 --> 03:01:58.718]  You know, I help people with pedophile stuff get jobs.
[03:01:58.718 --> 03:02:01.620]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[03:02:01.620 --> 03:02:02.440]  Right, exactly.
[03:02:02.440 --> 03:02:05.481]  And that's the whole thing is like you expose them.
[03:02:05.481 --> 03:02:06.902]  And then, okay, so for example,
[03:02:07.446 --> 03:02:16.290]  I went out today in my college and I said, I printed out the article, Ecogenocide, 11,000 scientists signed the order demanding globalists eliminate billions of humans from planet Earth.
[03:02:16.290 --> 03:02:25.674]  I printed that out and I actually changed about seven people's minds to not trust the scientific community fully, to not fully trust them and put all of their heart into it.
[03:02:25.674 --> 03:02:26.855]  Exactly, period.
[03:02:26.855 --> 03:02:31.717]  If we just use human intelligence and human action to just wake a few people up, it's game over.
[03:02:31.717 --> 03:02:34.038]  Because we've reached the tipping point.
[03:02:34.038 --> 03:02:36.239]  Exactly, so I'm doing that locally actually because, you know,
[03:02:37.150 --> 03:02:37.270]  Yeah.
[03:02:55.137 --> 03:02:56.338]  What do you think about Epstein?
[03:03:25.507 --> 03:03:28.750]  And people agree on that.
[03:03:28.750 --> 03:03:31.432]  I say, hey, listen, visit the site, buy these products.
[03:03:31.432 --> 03:03:33.133]  And I told them, who is this?
[03:03:33.133 --> 03:03:34.954]  Alex Jones?
[03:03:34.954 --> 03:03:35.775]  They're like, yeah.
[03:03:35.775 --> 03:03:37.136]  You're nice to tell them to get the products.
[03:03:37.136 --> 03:03:38.016]  That's how we find ourselves.
[03:03:38.016 --> 03:03:38.517]  And they're great.
[03:03:38.517 --> 03:03:42.300]  Just send people to BandOnVideo and say, hey, you know the guy that first exposed Epstein?
[03:03:42.300 --> 03:03:43.460]  They want him off the air.
[03:03:43.460 --> 03:03:45.562]  You know the guy that first exposed the coup against Trump?
[03:03:45.562 --> 03:03:47.083]  Find out what you're not supposed to hear.
[03:03:47.083 --> 03:03:50.606]  Doesn't everybody know that if they tell you you can't have something, you should go look it up?
[03:03:50.606 --> 03:03:53.068]  But see, their big lie is, Jones is off the air.
[03:03:53.068 --> 03:03:53.888]  You can't find him.
[03:03:53.888 --> 03:03:54.449]  People don't think.
[03:03:55.169 --> 03:03:58.412]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[03:03:58.412 --> 03:04:04.939]  But I was asking you, Michael, I mean, how big is it that, I mean, this Epstein thing, they didn't get away with it by killing him.
[03:04:04.939 --> 03:04:06.220]  I think it convicted him.
[03:04:06.220 --> 03:04:09.363]  This has really hit the zeitgeist.
[03:04:09.363 --> 03:04:10.745]  It absolutely has.
[03:04:10.745 --> 03:04:16.851]  This was the little, it's the boulder that's gone down the hill that's created the avalanche.
[03:04:16.851 --> 03:04:17.632]  Nobody
[03:04:18.769 --> 03:04:39.624]  He believes that this man who is connected to British royalties, connected to the Clintons, connected to everybody, he's that key to this whole pedophile ring and the child trafficking, the Luciferian, the spirit cooking, the whole nine yards.
[03:04:39.624 --> 03:04:45.448]  And now that it's obvious this guy didn't do this swan dive off the bed because he was
[03:04:46.289 --> 03:04:48.374]  It convicts the whole rotting thing.
[03:04:48.374 --> 03:04:49.897]  Back in 60 Seconds with Michael Graves.
[03:04:49.897 --> 03:04:51.160]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:04:51.160 --> 03:04:51.701]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:04:54.491 --> 03:04:57.232]  Please support us as well and spread the word about the transmission.
[03:04:57.232 --> 03:05:01.133]  And remember, your financial support is what makes this possible.
[03:05:01.133 --> 03:05:02.513]  Plus, we make it easy.
[03:05:02.513 --> 03:05:05.214]  We have really great products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:05.214 --> 03:05:11.616]  And we have the Alexa Pure Breeze that every year around this time, we are able to offer at their cost.
[03:05:11.616 --> 03:05:15.257]  And then we're given a rebate for the new year when we purchase these.
[03:05:15.257 --> 03:05:16.577]  This is what I have to pay taxes on.
[03:05:16.837 --> 03:05:20.059]  This is $147, is the cost, with free shipping.
[03:05:20.059 --> 03:05:21.299]  They've never done a deal that good.
[03:05:21.299 --> 03:05:22.500]  It's a hot item.
[03:05:22.500 --> 03:05:24.821]  They sell tens of thousands of these a year.
[03:05:24.821 --> 03:05:26.882]  It's a four-stage ion cluster.
[03:05:26.882 --> 03:05:29.283]  Other competing brands are $400, $500, $600, $700.
[03:05:29.283 --> 03:05:31.984]  All the markup.
[03:05:31.984 --> 03:05:34.646]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we usually sell these all day long for $250.
[03:05:34.646 --> 03:05:35.146]  They're a great deal.
[03:05:36.466 --> 03:05:36.567]  $147.
[03:05:36.567 --> 03:05:40.232]  I've told the guy, like, this cuts into the market.
[03:05:40.232 --> 03:05:42.135]  Selling this low, people don't appreciate it.
[03:05:42.135 --> 03:05:44.178]  Well, this is what the InfoWars audience gets.
[03:05:44.178 --> 03:05:48.745]  InfoWarshore.com, there's only a few hundred of these left at this price.
[03:05:48.745 --> 03:05:51.128]  And then more don't come in until next year.
[03:06:13.726 --> 03:06:17.047]  Man, so much news is breaking.
[03:06:17.047 --> 03:06:21.789]  Makes my head spin.
[03:06:21.789 --> 03:06:22.849]  Look at this story.
[03:06:22.849 --> 03:06:24.029]  Breaking Google.
[03:06:24.029 --> 03:06:27.770]  Running Orwellian Project to secretly Hoover up.
[03:06:27.770 --> 03:06:30.191]  Health records of millions of Americans across 21 states.
[03:06:30.191 --> 03:06:30.931]  Wall Street Journal.
[03:06:30.931 --> 03:06:32.672]  Of course, they've always been doing that.
[03:06:32.672 --> 03:06:35.733]  Kelsey Gabbard's demand Hillary retract Russia remarks.
[03:06:35.733 --> 03:06:37.573]  Video of that on Infowars.com.
[03:06:37.573 --> 03:06:41.595]  Bernie Sanders' AOC will play a very important role in White House if I'm elected.
[03:06:41.595 --> 03:06:42.095]  My God.
[03:06:43.763 --> 03:06:44.403]  So much more.
[03:06:44.403 --> 03:06:46.184]  Democrats support their own quid pro quo.
[03:06:46.184 --> 03:06:48.565]  Those are reports up on InfoWars.com.
[03:06:48.565 --> 03:06:50.826]  Michael Graves, former frontman of the Smart Guys.
[03:06:50.826 --> 03:06:52.006]  We're having him here.
[03:06:52.006 --> 03:06:53.187]  Of the Misfits and other great bands.
[03:06:53.187 --> 03:06:54.407]  OfficialMichaelGraves.com.
[03:06:54.407 --> 03:06:58.649]  We're jamming in some final calls here before Joe Salente takes over.
[03:06:58.649 --> 03:07:04.271]  But I was asking you about the collapse of the West Coast particularly, which the Democrats
[03:07:05.469 --> 03:07:07.551]  Well, allow the fentanyl and heroin shipped in.
[03:07:07.551 --> 03:07:10.613]  Then they have local welfare controllers that give them the check.
[03:07:10.613 --> 03:07:12.695]  They cash it, pay it into drug gangs.
[03:07:12.695 --> 03:07:14.036]  They order the police to stop it.
[03:07:14.036 --> 03:07:16.037]  Then that money goes right back to the Democrats.
[03:07:16.037 --> 03:07:17.619]  But you were saying it's more than that.
[03:07:17.619 --> 03:07:18.739]  It's about the demoralization.
[03:07:18.739 --> 03:07:19.900]  I totally agree.
[03:07:19.900 --> 03:07:20.621]  We have this video.
[03:07:20.621 --> 03:07:22.623]  It's up on Infowars.com, a Kit Daniels article.
[03:07:23.649 --> 03:07:31.414]  California man arrested for eating a subway station sandwich on a train station.
[03:07:31.414 --> 03:07:38.819]  Meanwhile, though, homeless shoot heroin up on the trains, don't get in trouble, poop in the trains, poop on the streets, don't get in trouble.
[03:07:38.819 --> 03:07:43.002]  Why do they persecute citizens but not people that have totally given up?
[03:07:43.002 --> 03:07:45.863]  Let's play that clip of the man being arrested.
[03:07:45.863 --> 03:07:48.765]  Here it is.
[03:07:48.765 --> 03:07:51.167]  You are detained and you're not free to go.
[03:07:52.461 --> 03:07:54.349]  You singled me out out of all these people.
[03:07:57.857 --> 03:08:00.358]  I'll stop there, it hasn't been blamed.
[03:08:23.124 --> 03:08:26.548]  And again, he was going to give him a ticket, search his bag, the guy starts complaining.
[03:08:26.548 --> 03:08:35.676]  But my point is, is that literally the homeless bit my cousin in Seattle and he got blood poisoning and died.
[03:08:35.676 --> 03:08:41.062]  He was giving one guy a $10 bill, the other guy got mad and bit my cousin who died from it.
[03:08:41.062 --> 03:08:44.585]  So literal zombies killed my cousin.
[03:08:44.585 --> 03:08:45.446]  I was very close to it.
[03:08:47.696 --> 03:08:50.477]  I've heard that story before, Alex, and it's horrible.
[03:08:50.477 --> 03:08:58.259]  That's a terrible story, but I just came from a string of shows in the Pacific Northwest, and it is absolutely disgusting up there.
[03:08:58.259 --> 03:09:03.640]  There's homeless people everywhere, and we were just talking during the break.
[03:09:03.640 --> 03:09:07.261]  I think it's throwing that depravity in our face.
[03:09:07.901 --> 03:09:16.569]  These people who are diseased, they're sick, they're broken in their minds, they hate everything, they're drug addicts.
[03:09:16.569 --> 03:09:27.858]  To push that depravity on us, and you see the other side of that, just some guy eating a sandwich, it's a demoralization effort, but I also believe
[03:09:28.499 --> 03:09:36.806]  That it's also a way for, like I was saying, the left and the progressives and these people to gain compassion.
[03:09:36.806 --> 03:09:39.749]  Oh, well, we have to help these people.
[03:09:39.749 --> 03:09:44.273]  They are the least, you know, among us and they need our help.
[03:09:44.273 --> 03:09:46.194]  And it's because of the conservatives.
[03:09:46.194 --> 03:09:52.560]  It's because of the people that support Trump that our world is like this.
[03:09:52.560 --> 03:09:53.180]  Absolutely.
[03:09:55.250 --> 03:09:58.313]  Total lawlessness in many areas of the country where the left are.
[03:09:58.313 --> 03:10:01.895]  But they'll, in Chicago, they'll give you a ticket for eating a sandwich on the train.
[03:10:01.895 --> 03:10:02.916]  You're not throwing food around.
[03:10:02.916 --> 03:10:03.917]  This guy was like, throwing food around?
[03:10:03.917 --> 03:10:05.258]  Sure, give him a ticket.
[03:10:05.258 --> 03:10:07.100]  But the point is, is that no, no, no.
[03:10:07.100 --> 03:10:08.381]  Then the gangs are shooting each other.
[03:10:08.381 --> 03:10:09.562]  Nobody even goes in those neighborhoods.
[03:10:09.562 --> 03:10:11.824]  That's how the Democrats roll.
[03:10:11.824 --> 03:10:13.045]  It's how they run things.
[03:10:13.045 --> 03:10:16.567]  What are some of the things you're going to talk about when you're on with Owen Schroeder today during the war room?
[03:10:16.567 --> 03:10:21.872]  I really want to talk about perhaps getting into the more spiritual side of things.
[03:10:21.872 --> 03:10:22.973]  And we talk about
[03:10:24.514 --> 03:10:27.517]  The energy and the spirit of things.
[03:10:27.517 --> 03:10:46.174]  I'm a musician, I'm an artist, and so it's important for me to be clear-headed and to make sure that I'm able to tap into that unseen force, that higher power that we're all... I've been preaching a lot about connectivity and the way that music affects us.
[03:10:46.815 --> 03:10:48.876]  And by the way, all these powerful people know this.
[03:10:48.876 --> 03:10:49.837]  They're not really atheists.
[03:10:49.837 --> 03:10:53.239]  I mean, I don't want to get into Glenn Danzig, but we never talked about it the other time, Sherman.
[03:10:53.239 --> 03:10:56.461]  He says, no, there's power in Christ and power in the devil.
[03:10:56.461 --> 03:11:06.887]  He at least admits it and knows it and is getting power from the dark side, but then on one side saying, I'm not a leftist and I don't support the left-hand path, but then singing songs about left-hand rise above.
[03:11:06.887 --> 03:11:10.068]  That's somebody that's like Faust caught between two worlds.
[03:11:10.068 --> 03:11:12.710]  Many of these people that are under Satan's control don't even know it.
[03:11:14.278 --> 03:11:15.279]  That's true.
[03:11:15.279 --> 03:11:33.074]  Yeah, you know, and you look at communism and socialism, it counterfeits Christianity because it goes with the premise that man is flawed, that we're broken, and that communism and socialism can fix it.
[03:11:33.074 --> 03:11:34.956]  But as believers, we know that
[03:11:35.356 --> 03:11:45.040]  That man is inherently broken, and it's the grace of Jesus, it's the grace of God and what was done at Calvary on the cross that saves us.
[03:11:45.040 --> 03:11:47.200]  It's not man that saves us.
[03:11:47.200 --> 03:12:01.066]  And as we get closer to that spirit, and I was saying how the InfoWars products keeps my spirit clean, it keeps my body healthy so that I can function at a higher level.
[03:12:01.066 --> 03:12:03.647]  My body's able to, my brain's able to function.
[03:12:03.647 --> 03:12:04.527]  Which product do you like the best?
[03:12:05.453 --> 03:12:06.473]  X2?
[03:12:06.473 --> 03:12:08.254]  I love the X2.
[03:12:08.254 --> 03:12:18.496]  What's really, really, really changed my life is the knockout, but also the Chill Force with the GABA has changed my life.
[03:12:18.496 --> 03:12:21.616]  I'm one of these people, again, you know, I'm an artist, so I'm a little bit of a diva.
[03:12:21.616 --> 03:12:28.898]  I have problems with anxiety, I've experienced depression, and since I've been on, I've taken the Chill Force Challenge with Chill Force and Brain Force.
[03:12:29.718 --> 03:12:47.644]  The GABA has done amazing things for me with anxiety and keeping me calm and not having me react the way that your brain reacts when the neurotransmitters just fire.
[03:12:47.644 --> 03:12:52.465]  Again, go and research the products and what they can do for you.
[03:12:52.465 --> 03:12:53.025]  Well, that's what we do.
[03:12:53.025 --> 03:12:55.166]  We go out of what's already proven to work.
[03:12:55.566 --> 03:12:59.695]  Then we just source organic and high quality forms of it, make sure there's a lot of it in there.
[03:12:59.695 --> 03:13:01.118]  Because, you know, I mean, take something like...
[03:13:02.776 --> 03:13:05.578]  What happens with turmeric?
[03:13:05.578 --> 03:13:07.600]  Well, most of it has 3 to 5% curcuminoid.
[03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:11.102]  We actually went out and got the highest anybody can make, 95% curcuminoid.
[03:13:11.102 --> 03:13:15.605]  So the amount, it doesn't even say giant on there because you're not supposed to count it as a concentrate.
[03:13:15.605 --> 03:13:18.708]  You just say it has turmeric in it.
[03:13:18.708 --> 03:13:21.650]  But it's really the strongest turmeric you're going to find out there.
[03:13:21.650 --> 03:13:23.591]  And that's why the stuff works so good.
[03:13:23.591 --> 03:13:25.032]  And that's what I treat folks like.
[03:13:25.032 --> 03:13:25.593]  I want to be treated.
[03:13:25.593 --> 03:13:27.094]  I take all these products.
[03:13:27.094 --> 03:13:28.255]  My children take the products.
[03:13:28.715 --> 03:13:33.938]  That's how we fund the operation, but I appreciate the fact that you use them and you like them and absolutely do.
[03:13:33.938 --> 03:13:36.860]  Chill force isn't a downer.
[03:13:36.860 --> 03:13:43.684]  What it does is when I take it, it gives me even more clarity when I'm taking natural stimulants like turbo force, which I don't take every time.
[03:13:43.684 --> 03:13:45.425]  Sometimes I'm going to be up for 20 hours working.
[03:13:45.425 --> 03:13:46.906]  I already have so much energy.
[03:13:46.906 --> 03:13:51.189]  I will take half a packet of turbo force, but then I'm going to need to take
[03:13:52.065 --> 03:13:55.027]  Chill Force and Knockout to come down off of it.
[03:13:55.027 --> 03:14:03.133]  And a lot of folks take it with the natural stimulus to make it smoother so that you don't have the, well, I can get aggressive, other people can have anxiety attacks.
[03:14:03.133 --> 03:14:04.113]  But that's just the way this stuff works.
[03:14:04.113 --> 03:14:07.315]  Look, Mother Nature is where the drug companies got all their stuff.
[03:14:07.315 --> 03:14:08.656]  They just twist it around.
[03:14:08.656 --> 03:14:11.518]  And that's all we're bringing you is what God gave us.
[03:14:11.518 --> 03:14:12.639]  And so they are amazing products.
[03:14:12.639 --> 03:14:15.141]  And I appreciate you saying those plugs for them, my friend.
[03:14:15.441 --> 03:14:17.502]  No worries, I mean it.
[03:14:17.502 --> 03:14:22.784]  I always hear people as well that call up and they want to know what they can do.
[03:14:22.784 --> 03:14:23.925]  They know what's going on.
[03:14:23.925 --> 03:14:32.829]  They understand the problem that we're facing with all of the tyranny, the oppression.
[03:14:32.829 --> 03:14:33.789]  What can I do?
[03:14:33.789 --> 03:14:35.130]  I'm just a regular person.
[03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:38.152]  Everybody should be brushing their teeth.
[03:14:38.152 --> 03:14:41.475]  So, I mean, you can buy a toothpaste.
[03:14:41.475 --> 03:14:44.037]  Everybody drinks coffee in the morning.
[03:14:44.037 --> 03:14:49.181]  Buy coffee from Infowars and bring money into this operation.
[03:14:49.181 --> 03:14:57.928]  We're able to pay the bills right now, but I want to expand and I want to really give them a run for their money in 2020 because I think you can see it's all on the line here.
[03:14:57.928 --> 03:15:03.333]  Gerald Cilente's coming up, but Jefferson, Tom, James, Phillip, and Jeff, speaking of products,
[03:15:04.173 --> 03:15:05.354]  I don't think so.
[03:15:21.880 --> 03:15:23.600]  Free t-shirt in whatever size they ask for.
[03:15:23.600 --> 03:15:25.101]  I apologize for keeping you on hold.
[03:15:25.101 --> 03:15:26.421]  I know you had great stuff to say.
[03:15:26.421 --> 03:15:34.584]  I want to hear what your points are and I promise, and I'm getting better, we're going to put more calls on the show and I'm going to do more live shows as well because people want to vent.
[03:15:34.584 --> 03:15:38.205]  They want to give their ideas and you folks bring up amazing ideas and amazing points.
[03:15:38.205 --> 03:15:46.087]  Gerald Cilente is taking over and in 45 minutes we're going to have the war with Owen Schroyer and Mr. Gray right here.

[03:18:55.626 --> 03:19:00.891]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[03:19:00.891 --> 03:19:11.781]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because they didn't get enough iodine.
[03:19:11.781 --> 03:19:15.945]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not true.
[03:19:15.945 --> 03:19:18.667]  But Dad, it's right here on the periodic table.
[03:19:18.667 --> 03:19:19.308]  When I click it,
[03:19:19.528 --> 03:19:20.749]  Saying exactly what you said.
[03:19:20.749 --> 03:19:22.350]  And I said, I know, honey.
[03:19:22.350 --> 03:19:26.833]  That's why I have you take a high-quality, nutraceutical-grade iodine.
[03:19:26.833 --> 03:19:29.375]  It's because it's why you're so vibrant.
[03:19:29.375 --> 03:19:30.696]  It's why you're so alive.
[03:19:30.696 --> 03:19:36.740]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age.
[03:19:36.740 --> 03:19:45.767]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself to know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion, are mentally retarded.
[03:19:46.207 --> 03:19:48.949]  On the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[03:19:48.949 --> 03:19:51.151]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[03:19:51.151 --> 03:19:58.596]  Infowars.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.485 --> 03:20:17.407]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:20:17.407 --> 03:20:28.576]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilenti.
[03:20:28.576 --> 03:20:29.717]  Hello, hello.
[03:20:29.717 --> 03:20:32.980]  Great to be back on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:32.980 --> 03:20:41.848]  And info was, you know, remember, don't remember, remember to support Alex Jones, keep the truth coming out there and buy those products.
[03:20:42.913 --> 03:20:47.735]  I got my favorite one, Supermail Vitality.
[03:20:47.735 --> 03:20:50.156]  OK.
[03:20:50.156 --> 03:20:53.517]  On the economic front, poof!
[03:20:53.517 --> 03:20:56.098]  And equity markets are really boosting around there.
[03:20:56.098 --> 03:20:58.979]  And you know why, don't you?
[03:20:58.979 --> 03:21:05.481]  More cheap monetary methadone shot into the system by the central banksters.
[03:21:05.481 --> 03:21:07.022]  That's right.
[03:21:07.022 --> 03:21:12.044]  A hundred and twenty billion dollars a day.
[03:21:13.046 --> 03:21:14.227]  During the weeks.
[03:21:14.227 --> 03:21:15.648]  That's right.
[03:21:15.648 --> 03:21:18.050]  Into the repo markets.
[03:21:18.050 --> 03:21:19.011]  What's a repo market?
[03:21:19.011 --> 03:21:19.611]  Who cares?
[03:21:19.611 --> 03:21:21.633]  It's a repo market.
[03:21:21.633 --> 03:21:27.497]  It's money for the gamblers to get cheap so they can keep the equity markets going.
[03:21:27.497 --> 03:21:29.819]  Today's a shaky day.
[03:21:29.819 --> 03:21:30.800]  Dow is down.
[03:21:30.800 --> 03:21:33.362]  Now it's up a bit.
[03:21:33.362 --> 03:21:37.045]  But over there in China, not happy days.
[03:21:37.045 --> 03:21:40.047]  The Hong Kong market down over 2%.
[03:21:41.129 --> 03:21:44.312]  As violence increases over there.
[03:21:44.312 --> 03:21:53.719]  Shanghai, and the Shenzhen markets in China, down.
[03:21:53.719 --> 03:21:57.862]  Europe, down.
[03:21:57.862 --> 03:22:00.824]  This is artificially being propped up.
[03:22:00.824 --> 03:22:05.448]  The protests in Hong Kong, this is a big issue.
[03:22:05.448 --> 03:22:08.931]  And it's something we're following very closely.
[03:22:08.931 --> 03:22:10.352]  The world is on fire.
[03:22:10.956 --> 03:22:18.201]  Not only those fires out in California and Australia and Indonesia and other places.
[03:22:18.201 --> 03:22:20.543]  That's on fire.
[03:22:20.543 --> 03:22:25.586]  You know, my saying is when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[03:22:25.586 --> 03:22:29.248]  And they're losing it in Hong Kong.
[03:22:29.248 --> 03:22:33.011]  Oh, yeah, it began with that extradition law.
[03:22:33.011 --> 03:22:40.296]  If you was found guilty of something in Hong Kong, you could get transferred over there to China to really get shafted by the government.
[03:22:40.933 --> 03:22:43.134]  That was the initial protest.
[03:22:43.134 --> 03:22:45.634]  But the protest is much bigger than that.
[03:22:45.634 --> 03:22:47.715]  The protest is against inequality.
[03:22:47.715 --> 03:22:51.336]  You've got a few people in Hong Kong that are almost at a joint.
[03:22:51.336 --> 03:22:54.596]  A lot of people are living in shoe boxes over there.
[03:22:54.596 --> 03:23:07.020]  And they don't dig the Chinese consumers, even though Hong Kong is Chinese, until the British, of course, took it over and gave it back to China, partially, in the deal made in 1997.
[03:23:09.312 --> 03:23:15.013]  That'll be semi-autonomous, and another 40 years it'll go all over to China.
[03:23:15.013 --> 03:23:18.034]  And they don't like that, the Hong Kong people.
[03:23:18.034 --> 03:23:22.414]  They don't want to live under an authoritarian government.
[03:23:22.414 --> 03:23:24.815]  These protests are big.
[03:23:24.815 --> 03:23:32.236]  But I want to also point out to you the hypocrisy of the way the American media reports this, and the Western media.
[03:23:32.236 --> 03:23:36.477]  Two protesters were killed in Hong Kong yesterday.
[03:23:36.477 --> 03:23:37.237]  Today.
[03:23:37.237 --> 03:23:37.977]  Last couple of days.
[03:23:39.076 --> 03:23:40.416]  Two.
[03:23:40.416 --> 03:23:42.377]  Hey, how many were killed in Yemen?
[03:23:42.377 --> 03:23:44.098]  Ah, what's the Yemen?
[03:23:44.098 --> 03:23:49.619]  Hey, how about how many were killed in Congo, in Sudan?
[03:23:49.619 --> 03:23:52.200]  Hey, how many were killed down there in Chile?
[03:23:52.200 --> 03:23:54.461]  Hey, don't say anything bad about Chile!
[03:23:54.461 --> 03:23:57.742]  America likes that billionaire in charge over there.
[03:23:57.742 --> 03:24:07.285]  And income inequality in Chile is one of the worst in the so-called developed world.
[03:24:07.285 --> 03:24:08.805]  United States isn't far behind.
[03:24:11.127 --> 03:24:13.849]  Of income inequality.
[03:24:13.849 --> 03:24:16.852]  How about the people that were killed in Ecuador?
[03:24:16.852 --> 03:24:18.553]  They don't count as much.
[03:24:18.553 --> 03:24:23.277]  So I'm wondering why two people, and this is big news.
[03:24:23.277 --> 03:24:26.019]  Hey, how about this one?
[03:24:26.019 --> 03:24:38.609]  How about the 320 people that were killed in Iraq as they're demonstrating against their corrupt government and the violence and poverty wracking that nation?
[03:24:39.104 --> 03:24:46.727]  Brought to you by the United States, of course, under the war criminal George Bush and Penis Cheney.
[03:24:46.727 --> 03:24:48.427]  I can't say dick.
[03:24:48.427 --> 03:24:51.869]  I don't want to get censored.
[03:24:51.869 --> 03:24:53.689]  Oh, and I forgot Condoleezza Rice.
[03:24:53.689 --> 03:24:56.270]  If only a woman was in charge.
[03:24:56.270 --> 03:24:57.751]  Yeah.
[03:24:57.751 --> 03:24:58.851]  Doesn't make any difference.
[03:24:58.851 --> 03:25:05.214]  Black, white, green, yellow, gender, race, creed, color, doesn't make any difference.
[03:25:05.214 --> 03:25:07.174]  Good and bad comes in all of them.
[03:25:07.174 --> 03:25:08.555]  But going back to Hong Kong,
[03:25:09.861 --> 03:25:11.162]  Two deaths.
[03:25:11.162 --> 03:25:13.202]  Big news.
[03:25:13.202 --> 03:25:14.663]  Iraq?
[03:25:14.663 --> 03:25:16.624]  Over 300?
[03:25:16.624 --> 03:25:18.464]  Nobody knows.
[03:25:18.464 --> 03:25:21.886]  Not a major news story.
[03:25:21.886 --> 03:25:28.668]  So going back to the economy, this is a huge issue for China.
[03:25:28.668 --> 03:25:34.171]  Because President Xi met with this lamb.
[03:25:34.171 --> 03:25:35.391]  Mary had a little lamb.
[03:25:35.391 --> 03:25:36.391]  No, not that one.
[03:25:36.391 --> 03:25:37.792]  There's no bee on this lamb.
[03:25:38.496 --> 03:25:42.359]  She's the chosen person to be running Hong Kong.
[03:25:42.359 --> 03:25:43.679]  And they met last week.
[03:25:43.679 --> 03:25:51.404]  This is the first time that she went to China to meet with President Xi of China.
[03:25:51.404 --> 03:25:59.610]  And they made it very clear they will not tolerate what's going on in Hong Kong and will do everything to quash it.
[03:25:59.610 --> 03:26:06.634]  I'm mentioning this because it goes back to the markets of what I talked about to begin with.
[03:26:06.634 --> 03:26:07.135]  And that is
[03:26:08.680 --> 03:26:15.865]  Hong Kong is the investment hub of Asia.
[03:26:15.865 --> 03:26:18.908]  And a lot of banksters are there.
[03:26:18.908 --> 03:26:21.750]  And guess what?
[03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:24.672]  They're moving their money out.
[03:26:24.672 --> 03:26:31.837]  China cannot afford to lose Hong Kong as the banking center of Asia.
[03:26:31.837 --> 03:26:36.481]  So they're in a very difficult position here of stopping these protesters.
[03:26:39.631 --> 03:26:42.672]  So, keep your eye on that.
[03:26:42.672 --> 03:26:54.216]  So, going back to the equity markets, it looks, again, I would have thought the bull run was over in the equities.
[03:26:54.216 --> 03:26:57.598]  That was my forecast, that they had topped.
[03:26:57.598 --> 03:26:59.138]  You don't see it going much higher.
[03:26:59.138 --> 03:27:05.881]  But, when does a junkie have enough?
[03:27:05.881 --> 03:27:07.161]  And that's all they are.
[03:27:08.800 --> 03:27:11.482]  They call them investors on Wall Street.
[03:27:11.482 --> 03:27:12.823]  They're money junkies.
[03:27:12.823 --> 03:27:15.966]  They're addicts.
[03:27:15.966 --> 03:27:18.668]  They can never get enough.
[03:27:18.668 --> 03:27:25.334]  And the Fed is giving them their fix.
[03:27:25.334 --> 03:27:27.796]  The monetary methadone.
[03:27:27.796 --> 03:27:35.142]  So the markets are going to keep going up, it looks like, for a while, unless there's a wild card event.
[03:27:35.142 --> 03:27:37.124]  So you may be seeing new highs in the
[03:27:38.342 --> 03:27:39.443]  Markets are up.
[03:27:39.443 --> 03:27:42.284]  S&P 500's up some 23% this year.
[03:27:42.284 --> 03:27:48.167]  Hitting new highs.
[03:27:48.167 --> 03:27:50.068]  So.
[03:27:50.068 --> 03:27:53.009]  Gold prices.
[03:27:53.009 --> 03:27:56.031]  They came down a lot.
[03:27:56.031 --> 03:27:58.452]  They're now below that $1,460 an ounce mark.
[03:27:58.452 --> 03:27:59.293]  So how low can gold go?
[03:27:59.293 --> 03:27:59.953]  Will it go lower?
[03:28:09.011 --> 03:28:11.513]  Or will it go higher?
[03:28:11.513 --> 03:28:14.355]  Because you know my forecast.
[03:28:14.355 --> 03:28:15.316]  Here's part of it.
[03:28:15.316 --> 03:28:20.960]  When gold breaks over $14.50, which it has, it's going to spike to a $2,000.
[03:28:20.960 --> 03:28:22.521]  It started going there.
[03:28:22.521 --> 03:28:26.724]  But now there's a reversal.
[03:28:26.724 --> 03:28:30.767]  So here's the reversal side of it.
[03:28:30.767 --> 03:28:35.050]  Should gold go under $14.50 an ounce?
[03:28:35.050 --> 03:28:38.153]  I'll tell you where it's going to go when you come back.
[03:28:39.431 --> 03:28:42.596]  Just a few minutes.
[03:28:42.596 --> 03:28:45.642]  Don't forget, keep buying these products.
[03:28:52.219 --> 03:28:55.241]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[03:28:55.241 --> 03:28:58.142]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[03:29:54.538 --> 03:30:09.803]  The witch queen of the deep state lost the 2016 election because she was arrogant and the corporate whores in the media busily covering up her giant pedophile and blackmail raids thought that her victory was assured.
[03:30:09.803 --> 03:30:10.603]  Now that the
[03:30:10.703 --> 03:30:12.384]  The enemy lost that election.
[03:30:12.384 --> 03:30:16.446]  They are awake and throwing everything they've got at us.
[03:30:16.446 --> 03:30:21.968]  And conservatives and nationalists and Christians and patriots, many of them, are asleep thinking 2020's in the bag.
[03:30:21.968 --> 03:30:24.550]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just lost Kentucky governorship.
[03:30:24.550 --> 03:30:28.452]  We just lost the Virginia Statehouse the first time in 30 years.
[03:30:28.452 --> 03:30:29.632]  This is serious.
[03:30:29.632 --> 03:30:33.234]  We can win again and secure the gains we've gotten.
[03:30:33.234 --> 03:30:35.155]  Or we can see it all wash down the drain.

[03:31:54.581 --> 03:31:58.265]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[03:31:58.265 --> 03:32:06.253]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems in people will like different formulas.
[03:32:06.253 --> 03:32:08.836]  It's just that simple.
[03:32:08.836 --> 03:32:15.242]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three types to absorb.
[03:32:15.242 --> 03:32:15.783]  Others like
[03:32:16.323 --> 03:32:18.425]  The Pure Atomic Iodine.
[03:32:18.425 --> 03:32:19.145]  Get both.
[03:32:19.145 --> 03:32:20.606]  They're both great for you.
[03:32:20.606 --> 03:32:25.030]  Whichever one you like, use that and give the other to family or friends.
[03:32:25.030 --> 03:32:27.232]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[03:32:27.232 --> 03:32:28.593]  That's why I harp on it.
[03:32:28.593 --> 03:32:32.436]  The globalists want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[03:32:32.756 --> 03:32:35.997]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long.
[03:32:35.997 --> 03:32:36.757]  It's simple.
[03:32:36.757 --> 03:32:41.359]  Get your high quality iodine at InfoWarStore.com and help fund the InfoWar.
[03:32:41.359 --> 03:32:43.460]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:32:43.460 --> 03:32:46.161]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[03:32:46.161 --> 03:32:47.981]  It's the Iodine Challenge.
[03:32:47.981 --> 03:32:55.484]  Both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[03:32:55.484 --> 03:32:58.165]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:12.418 --> 03:33:14.839]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:14.839 --> 03:33:17.480]  It's Gerald Solente.
[03:33:17.480 --> 03:33:20.801]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.801 --> 03:33:24.582]  Hello, hello.
[03:33:24.582 --> 03:33:26.622]  So, where's gold going?
[03:33:26.622 --> 03:33:28.703]  Here's where it's going.
[03:33:28.703 --> 03:33:30.783]  If it breaks below $1,450 an ounce,
[03:33:35.497 --> 03:33:36.198]  Sure.
[03:33:36.198 --> 03:33:39.820]  My forecast is that it'll bottom out at $1,390.
[03:33:39.820 --> 03:33:45.863]  That's my forecast, you know.
[03:33:45.863 --> 03:33:46.844]  Can it go lower?
[03:33:46.844 --> 03:33:48.605]  Hey, who knows?
[03:33:48.605 --> 03:33:50.786]  But that's where I see it going.
[03:33:50.786 --> 03:33:53.187]  I don't see it going much lower than that.
[03:33:53.187 --> 03:33:58.430]  Because all the central banks around the world are lowering interest rates.
[03:33:58.430 --> 03:34:03.753]  Over there in the underdeveloped nations, they're very risky.
[03:34:04.707 --> 03:34:08.768]  You see, the dollar is staying strong.
[03:34:08.768 --> 03:34:14.430]  And it's staying strong because the other economies are so weak.
[03:34:14.430 --> 03:34:18.631]  For example, we're just writing the Trends Journal.
[03:34:18.631 --> 03:34:21.651]  It's a weekly now.
[03:34:21.651 --> 03:34:29.333]  And we're writing about the economy just before I got on the air and talking about Germany.
[03:34:29.333 --> 03:34:31.134]  German nation's stagnation.
[03:34:31.621 --> 03:34:43.249]  Industrial production in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has slipped 4.3% in the 12 months to September.
[03:34:43.249 --> 03:34:55.798]  One group is forecasting GDP growth at 0.3% in the third quarter.
[03:34:55.798 --> 03:35:00.722]  And they're forecasting GDP growth
[03:35:01.246 --> 03:35:05.348]  In all of 2020, to only 1%.
[03:35:05.348 --> 03:35:10.171]  Others are saying it's going to go lower.
[03:35:10.171 --> 03:35:14.394]  This coming Thursday, they're coming out with the GDP numbers.
[03:35:14.394 --> 03:35:22.739]  And Germany could now have two consecutive quarters of negative GDP, which officially puts them into a recession.
[03:35:22.739 --> 03:35:27.722]  I'm mentioning this because it's Germany.
[03:35:27.722 --> 03:35:29.723]  So the dollar's staying strong,
[03:35:30.359 --> 03:35:34.421]  Because other economies are going so weak.
[03:35:34.421 --> 03:35:37.523]  What are the interest rates in Europe?
[03:35:37.523 --> 03:35:41.085]  Negative.
[03:35:41.085 --> 03:35:42.426]  0.5.
[03:35:42.426 --> 03:35:44.467]  Negative.
[03:35:44.467 --> 03:35:48.029]  What are they in the United States?
[03:35:48.029 --> 03:35:48.929]  Only a plus 1.50.
[03:35:48.929 --> 03:35:54.933]  So, it could go lower here.
[03:35:54.933 --> 03:35:57.534]  How much lower are they going to go into negative territory over there?
[03:35:58.510 --> 03:36:11.822]  Going back to the underdeveloped nations and other nations, including China, they have massive amounts of debt in dollars.
[03:36:11.822 --> 03:36:13.143]  The stronger the U.S.
[03:36:13.143 --> 03:36:17.147]  dollar gets, the weaker their currencies go.
[03:36:17.147 --> 03:36:23.753]  That means they have to pay back their debt with more dough as their currencies go low.
[03:36:25.751 --> 03:36:27.351]  So that's what's going on in the world.
[03:36:27.351 --> 03:36:42.775]  The United States is separate in so many ways from the economic indicators that are showing real serious problems coming about that aren't reported in this country.
[03:36:42.775 --> 03:36:47.356]  Before I got on the air, I went on to CNBC.
[03:36:47.356 --> 03:36:50.577]  I clicked on business and then I went to the economy.
[03:36:52.466 --> 03:36:57.009]  Do you know the last economic story they put up there on the economy on CNBC?
[03:36:57.009 --> 03:37:00.812]  It was from November 10th.
[03:37:00.812 --> 03:37:04.355]  That's right.
[03:37:04.355 --> 03:37:07.057]  So they're not looking at the world.
[03:37:07.057 --> 03:37:09.819]  You look what's going on in China.
[03:37:09.819 --> 03:37:13.542]  There's a slowdown going on.
[03:37:13.542 --> 03:37:21.868]  They're hesitant, as opposed to what President Trump is saying, to lower the value of their currency, the yuan.
[03:37:23.444 --> 03:37:30.087]  Because they have so much debt in dollar denomination.
[03:37:30.087 --> 03:37:39.451]  It's estimated the private sector has some $16 trillion in dollar-denominated debt.
[03:37:39.451 --> 03:37:43.753]  So the lower their yuan goes, the more they gotta pay it back.
[03:37:43.753 --> 03:37:48.535]  And now, by the way, the yuan's going back up.
[03:37:48.535 --> 03:37:51.857]  And it's not affecting trade.
[03:37:52.790 --> 03:37:57.854]  Because in the United States, we saw the trade numbers come out.
[03:37:57.854 --> 03:38:15.929]  And despite President Trump's pledge to reverse the negative trade deficit, imports for goods and services leaped 5.4% last month, up $17.8 billion.
[03:38:15.929 --> 03:38:20.032]  That should be, yeah.
[03:38:20.032 --> 03:38:22.494]  And for the full third quarter up to this year,
[03:38:24.592 --> 03:38:31.035]  $481 billion dollar trade deficit.
[03:38:31.035 --> 03:38:34.756]  Or I should say imports.
[03:38:34.756 --> 03:38:38.678]  Meanwhile, exports fell by $7 trillion.
[03:38:38.678 --> 03:38:43.900]  So this trade war, tariff war, there's no war.
[03:38:43.900 --> 03:38:46.501]  It's a losing war.
[03:38:46.501 --> 03:38:49.922]  Kind of reminds me of all the other American wars.
[03:38:49.922 --> 03:38:51.743]  You had the Vietnam War, the Hong Kong War,
[03:38:52.625 --> 03:38:53.685]  Hey, how about the Iraq War?
[03:38:53.685 --> 03:38:54.866]  What about the Afghan War?
[03:38:54.866 --> 03:38:55.746]  Maybe the Libyan War?
[03:38:55.746 --> 03:38:58.786]  I got it, the Syrian War.
[03:38:58.786 --> 03:39:01.027]  No winners, all losers.
[03:39:01.027 --> 03:39:02.387]  Another losing war.
[03:39:02.387 --> 03:39:21.412]  And by the way, I am totally in favor of restoring the trade regulations that existed before slick Willie Clinton brought us into NAFTA and the World Trade Organization laws.
[03:39:22.648 --> 03:39:26.089]  So I'm in favor of a self-sustaining economy.
[03:39:26.089 --> 03:39:33.391]  So when I report these numbers, it's not what I like, what I want, what I wish, it's what is.
[03:39:33.391 --> 03:39:50.415]  So now, when you put it all together, and going back to what's going on around the world, these riots and uprisings, these revolts, it's all about the bottom line.
[03:39:52.267 --> 03:39:56.590]  Because all the money that's been created has gone to the 1%.
[03:39:56.590 --> 03:40:00.533]  And I'm not making that up.
[03:40:00.533 --> 03:40:01.994]  The facts are there.
[03:40:01.994 --> 03:40:13.762]  And now you're hearing all these guys like Jamie Dimon, by the way, you know, the head of the JPMorgan Chase Bankster.
[03:40:13.762 --> 03:40:20.106]  Another guy with an attitude born on third base and thought he had a home run.
[03:40:20.106 --> 03:40:20.967]  That's right.
[03:40:22.179 --> 03:40:25.160]  Daddy was a bankster.
[03:40:25.160 --> 03:40:28.162]  Daddy worked on Wall Street.
[03:40:28.162 --> 03:40:31.443]  Daddy opened the doors to him.
[03:40:31.443 --> 03:40:33.584]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale.
[03:40:33.584 --> 03:40:36.326]  Bullets, bombs, and banksters.
[03:40:36.326 --> 03:40:37.606]  You got it?
[03:40:37.606 --> 03:40:40.908]  The arrogance of these people.
[03:40:40.908 --> 03:40:44.910]  The arrogance.
[03:40:44.910 --> 03:40:47.691]  Hey, and who did it, you liberals?
[03:40:47.691 --> 03:40:50.493]  Don't forget who helped a lot.
[03:40:50.493 --> 03:40:51.333]  Obama.
[03:40:52.850 --> 03:41:16.434]  The Nobel Piece of Crap Prize winner, the liar-in-chief, the pathological liar-in-chief, who lied his way into office as an anti-war president, and he was gonna take after that Wall Street gang that shafted so many people around this country and ruined millions of lives, and didn't put one of the banksters in jail.
[03:41:16.434 --> 03:41:18.254]  You remember Eric Holder?
[03:41:18.254 --> 03:41:19.275]  Oh yeah, hold this.
[03:41:19.275 --> 03:41:20.895]  That Eric Holder.
[03:41:20.895 --> 03:41:21.475]  Oh yeah!
[03:41:22.725 --> 03:41:24.766]  Now, he was the Attorney General back then.
[03:41:24.766 --> 03:41:32.050]  Now, working for a white shoe law firm over there in Wall Street gang.
[03:41:32.050 --> 03:41:37.953]  They were too big to jail.
[03:41:37.953 --> 03:41:40.114]  That's what's going on.
[03:41:40.114 --> 03:41:49.239]  The money is all going to the top and the rest of the country is going to the bottom around the world.
[03:41:49.239 --> 03:41:51.760]  But over around the world, he's fighting.
[03:41:53.482 --> 03:41:55.643]  No fight in the USA.
[03:41:55.643 --> 03:41:59.085]  No bullying zones.
[03:41:59.085 --> 03:42:00.626]  You got no bullying zones.
[03:42:00.626 --> 03:42:02.748]  You can't go out and fight.
[03:42:02.748 --> 03:42:04.168]  That's right, men.
[03:42:04.168 --> 03:42:06.050]  Be little girls.
[03:42:06.050 --> 03:42:09.192]  And women.
[03:42:09.192 --> 03:42:10.412]  How about the women?
[03:42:10.412 --> 03:42:15.675]  Hey, where are the Me Too women in what they did to that woman down in Bolivia?
[03:42:15.675 --> 03:42:17.356]  The mayor of a city.
[03:42:17.356 --> 03:42:19.878]  Oh, you didn't see that because they didn't report it?
[03:42:19.878 --> 03:42:22.980]  Because the American government doesn't like the government in Bolivia.
[03:42:23.906 --> 03:42:34.873]  Oh, all they did was drag her out of her office, cut her hair, pour red paint on her, and make her walk barefoot?
[03:42:34.873 --> 03:42:36.694]  Hey, where's Me Too?
[03:42:36.694 --> 03:42:38.415]  You didn't see that one?
[03:42:38.415 --> 03:42:41.937]  Could you imagine if that was in a country that America liked?
[03:42:41.937 --> 03:42:44.818]  Ooh, be a different story.
[03:42:44.818 --> 03:42:50.582]  But it's all a fairy tale when you watch the mainstream media, and that's why you have to support InfoWars.
[03:42:52.012 --> 03:42:53.393]  Do what you can.
[03:42:53.393 --> 03:42:56.156]  Please support us as well and spread the word about the transmission.
[03:42:56.156 --> 03:43:00.080]  And remember, your financial support is what makes this possible.
[03:43:00.080 --> 03:43:01.441]  Plus, we make it easy.
[03:43:01.441 --> 03:43:10.209]  We have really great products at InfoWareStore.com and we have the Alexa Pure Breeze that every year around this time we are able to offer at their cost.
[03:43:10.549 --> 03:43:14.390]  And then we're given a rebate for the new year when we purchase these.
[03:43:14.390 --> 03:43:15.751]  That's what I have to pay taxes on.
[03:43:15.751 --> 03:43:18.992]  This is $147, is the cost, with free shipping.
[03:43:18.992 --> 03:43:20.232]  They've never done a deal that good.
[03:43:20.232 --> 03:43:21.433]  It's a hot item.
[03:43:21.433 --> 03:43:23.753]  They sell tens of thousands of these a year.
[03:43:23.753 --> 03:43:25.794]  It's a four-stage ion cluster.
[03:43:25.794 --> 03:43:29.115]  Other competing brands are $400, $500, $600, $700.
[03:43:29.115 --> 03:43:30.916]  All the markup.
[03:43:30.916 --> 03:43:33.577]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we usually sell these all day long for $250.
[03:43:33.577 --> 03:43:34.077]  They're a great deal.
[03:43:35.388 --> 03:43:35.488]  $147.
[03:43:35.488 --> 03:43:39.151]  I've told the guy, like, this cuts into the market.
[03:43:39.151 --> 03:43:40.051]  Selling just slow.
[03:43:40.051 --> 03:43:41.052]  People don't appreciate it.
[03:43:41.052 --> 03:43:43.093]  Well, this is what the InfoWars audience gets.
[03:43:43.093 --> 03:43:44.074]  InfoWarshore.com.
[03:43:44.074 --> 03:43:47.636]  There's only a few hundred of these left at this price.
[03:43:47.636 --> 03:43:50.058]  And then more don't come in until next year.
[03:43:52.532 --> 03:43:54.713]  All of our bodies are different.
[03:43:54.713 --> 03:43:57.495]  All of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[03:43:57.495 --> 03:44:00.496]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[03:44:00.496 --> 03:44:07.259]  There's a lot of factors that go into this, and I'm not telling you something you don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[03:44:07.259 --> 03:44:09.581]  Every time I commit and use
[03:44:10.721 --> 03:44:14.665]  The supplements that we sell on a religious basis.
[03:44:14.665 --> 03:44:16.346]  My life completely changes.
[03:44:16.346 --> 03:44:17.087]  I'm healthier.
[03:44:17.087 --> 03:44:18.448]  I have more energy.
[03:44:18.448 --> 03:44:19.269]  I lose weight.
[03:44:19.269 --> 03:44:20.049]  I look better.
[03:44:20.049 --> 03:44:21.611]  Everybody notices.
[03:44:21.611 --> 03:44:28.137]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2 Body's Ultimate Turmeric.
[03:44:28.897 --> 03:44:33.962]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the Gut Fusion from Infolware's Life.
[03:44:33.962 --> 03:44:38.867]  And when I take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[03:44:38.867 --> 03:44:44.273]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use that I don't talk enough about is Gut Fusion.
[03:44:44.273 --> 03:44:45.374]  Folks, check it out.
[03:44:45.374 --> 03:44:46.915]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:44:46.915 --> 03:44:48.297]  50% off right now.
[03:44:48.297 --> 03:44:49.858]  The sale's about to end.
[03:44:49.858 --> 03:44:50.459]  Gut Fusion.
[03:44:50.459 --> 03:44:51.440]  Infolwarestore.com.
[03:44:53.447 --> 03:44:55.088]  The Alex Jones Show!
[03:45:23.387 --> 03:45:29.372]  You take a high-quality, nutraceutical-grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant.
[03:45:29.372 --> 03:45:30.693]  It's why you're so alive.
[03:45:30.693 --> 03:45:36.759]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age.
[03:45:36.759 --> 03:45:45.787]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself to know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion are mentally retarded.
[03:45:46.227 --> 03:45:48.968]  On the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[03:45:48.968 --> 03:45:51.148]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[03:45:51.148 --> 03:45:57.709]  InfoWars.com The time has come to defy the Thought Police.
[03:45:57.709 --> 03:46:01.210]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[03:46:01.210 --> 03:46:04.790]  They're waging war on communication itself.
[03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:11.532]  As the Fabian Socialists promised they would do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[03:46:11.532 --> 03:46:13.912]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping.
[03:46:14.492 --> 03:46:20.940]  The ADL and others will literally bankrupt you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[03:46:20.940 --> 03:46:28.008]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what they're doing.
[03:46:28.008 --> 03:46:30.551]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous.
[03:46:31.191 --> 03:46:35.432]  And the answer to their attack on speech is to exercise it in their face.
[03:46:35.432 --> 03:46:39.354]  We have a it's okay to be okay politically incorrect ball cap.
[03:46:39.354 --> 03:46:40.194]  It's black and white.
[03:46:40.194 --> 03:46:40.694]  Very nice.
[03:46:40.694 --> 03:46:42.175]  It has the okay symbol on it.
[03:46:42.175 --> 03:46:43.995]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[03:46:43.995 --> 03:46:45.996]  Infowars.com is on the back.
[03:46:45.996 --> 03:46:56.419]  Get yours today at infowarsstore.com and support free speech by supporting Infowars while having a great hat.
[03:46:56.419 --> 03:46:59.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.657 --> 03:47:18.039]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:18.039 --> 03:47:25.744]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:47:25.744 --> 03:47:27.265]  Hello, hello.
[03:47:27.265 --> 03:47:30.366]  Glad to be back on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:30.366 --> 03:47:31.607]  And for a couple of weeks.
[03:47:31.607 --> 03:47:33.288]  Here I am, man.
[03:47:33.288 --> 03:47:34.709]  There you are.
[03:47:34.709 --> 03:47:42.914]  In order to keep Alex Jones and InfoWars going, you get to truth out there when all you're getting is fake news and crap news.
[03:47:44.810 --> 03:47:48.833]  You have to support them to keep it going, or else it's going to be gone.
[03:47:48.833 --> 03:47:51.514]  So do what you can to put your money where your heart is.
[03:47:51.514 --> 03:48:01.141]  And the all-new Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste has finally arrived at InfoWarsStores.com.
[03:48:01.141 --> 03:48:03.182]  InfoWars Life has done it again.
[03:48:03.182 --> 03:48:14.630]  They've secured a new line of fluoride-free toothpaste that's loaded with natural ingredients proven to kill bacteria, whiten your teeth, and so much more.
[03:48:15.438 --> 03:48:34.908]  The new super silver whitening toothpaste at InfoWarsStore.com contains patented silver solo nano silver technology that's been scientifically proven to kill the bacteria that causes gingivitis.
[03:48:34.908 --> 03:48:45.033]  It even comes loaded with another special ingredient, above sea coral calcium carbonate, which is known to not only whiten
[03:48:45.649 --> 03:48:49.091]  But re-mineralize your teat.
[03:48:49.091 --> 03:48:50.933]  So, do what you can.
[03:48:50.933 --> 03:48:55.156]  I'm going to try that product.
[03:48:55.156 --> 03:49:08.645]  So, talking about the economy, talking about what's going on around the globe, and how the 1% has gained so much.
[03:49:14.761 --> 03:49:17.041]  The numbers are real.
[03:49:17.041 --> 03:49:29.304]  You're seeing now they've come out with the 1% has now more assets than the entire middle class.
[03:49:29.304 --> 03:49:34.305]  So that's why you're seeing these outbreaks around the world.
[03:49:34.305 --> 03:49:35.965]  Lebanon, that's what it's about.
[03:49:35.965 --> 03:49:41.106]  Inequality, corrupt governments, poverty.
[03:49:41.106 --> 03:49:44.507]  When you go to Ecuador, Chile,
[03:49:45.498 --> 03:49:49.079]  All the countries I've been mentioning.
[03:49:49.079 --> 03:49:51.060]  Algeria.
[03:49:51.060 --> 03:50:02.264]  It's about the 1% owning everything and poverty, crime and corruption being the foundation of most governments.
[03:50:02.264 --> 03:50:07.566]  I'm mentioning this because you know I'm forecasting the greatest depression is going to hit in 2021.
[03:50:07.566 --> 03:50:09.767]  I'm saying 2021 because the Federal Reserve
[03:50:12.554 --> 03:50:18.238]  It's going to lower interest rates, as I said, to zero to negative interest rate policy.
[03:50:18.238 --> 03:50:25.182]  And so too, banks around the world are going to do what they can to keep injecting more monetary methadone to keep the bull running.
[03:50:25.182 --> 03:50:27.803]  But it's not going to work.
[03:50:27.803 --> 03:50:31.866]  If you think you see a homeless crisis now, you haven't seen anything.
[03:50:31.866 --> 03:50:34.688]  And I know they have one down there in Austin.
[03:50:34.688 --> 03:50:41.512]  From what I read, the mayor down there, he wants to bring a homeless person near a home near you.
[03:50:42.506 --> 03:50:44.668]  And the governor doesn't want to.
[03:50:44.668 --> 03:50:49.391]  And the governor's doing what I had proposed to do, and had been proposing.
[03:50:49.391 --> 03:51:01.261]  And that is, with all the state land that we have, start putting the homeless, not in shelters, but start building facilities.
[03:51:01.261 --> 03:51:02.081]  You want to camp out?
[03:51:02.081 --> 03:51:03.823]  You can camp out in the beautiful nature.
[03:51:03.823 --> 03:51:07.926]  And we have farms, and production.
[03:51:07.926 --> 03:51:11.369]  They can get to work doing things, and living decent lives.
[03:51:13.354 --> 03:51:17.435]  Rather than putting them in homeless shelters in the middle of cities.
[03:51:17.435 --> 03:51:19.955]  What are they going to get in cities?
[03:51:19.955 --> 03:51:25.217]  They'll get a lot more if they go to the country.
[03:51:25.217 --> 03:51:33.138]  So anyway, that's my proposal, but I'm mentioning the homeless because as this greatest depression hits, people are going to be out in the streets.
[03:51:33.138 --> 03:51:34.318]  They're going to be losing everything.
[03:51:34.318 --> 03:51:38.719]  And when they have nothing left to lose, as I said, they lose it.
[03:51:38.719 --> 03:51:41.080]  So you're going to see more riots, more demonstrations, more crime.
[03:51:42.887 --> 03:51:46.450]  People will steal, rob, kill to get what they need.
[03:51:46.450 --> 03:51:48.392]  This thing's going to be out of control.
[03:51:48.392 --> 03:51:57.139]  So when I talk about this also, considering all the other products that InfoWars has, you want to prepare for the worst.
[03:51:57.139 --> 03:52:03.584]  If the worst doesn't happen and you're prepared for it, you lose nothing.
[03:52:03.584 --> 03:52:10.469]  If the worst happens and you're prepared for nothing, you lose everything, or odds are you will.
[03:52:10.469 --> 03:52:12.411]  So, going on again.
[03:52:13.160 --> 03:52:16.002]  About what's going on around the world.
[03:52:16.002 --> 03:52:22.227]  One key indicator to look at are auto sales.
[03:52:22.227 --> 03:52:25.769]  And auto sales are in a big slump.
[03:52:25.769 --> 03:52:27.090]  Trade war?
[03:52:27.090 --> 03:52:30.673]  They don't have one over there in India.
[03:52:30.673 --> 03:52:33.134]  But India car sales are down some 41%.
[03:52:33.134 --> 03:52:38.298]  In the United States they're flattening out, they're going down.
[03:52:38.298 --> 03:52:40.660]  And the debt that people are taking on,
[03:52:43.857 --> 03:52:51.480]  They have cars now because they're trading in the ones that they bought and taking out a new loan.
[03:52:51.480 --> 03:52:55.002]  They're getting deeper and deeper in debt.
[03:52:55.002 --> 03:53:08.367]  When you put student loan, credit card debt, the national debt, the debt from Social Security, all the debt that the United States has piled up,
[03:53:09.625 --> 03:53:15.108]  The global debt, they say, is about $250 trillion.
[03:53:15.108 --> 03:53:19.170]  The United States debt bubble is about $270 trillion.
[03:53:19.170 --> 03:53:23.833]  So things are not going to get better.
[03:53:23.833 --> 03:53:28.515]  This is artificially propped up.
[03:53:28.515 --> 03:53:37.320]  So again, as we know by, I mentioned Jamie Dimon, the bankster with the JPMorgan Chase
[03:53:39.170 --> 03:53:41.970]  Outfit?
[03:53:41.970 --> 03:53:46.991]  Weren't they convicted, a bunch of guys there, for rigging the gold market?
[03:53:46.991 --> 03:53:48.152]  Huh.
[03:53:48.152 --> 03:53:50.792]  Seems like I can recall that.
[03:53:50.792 --> 03:53:53.232]  So the markets are rigged.
[03:53:53.232 --> 03:53:57.593]  The banksters don't want to see gold prices spike.
[03:53:57.593 --> 03:54:02.314]  It's best for them to keep gold low.
[03:54:02.314 --> 03:54:07.675]  And talking about banksters, you got that Deutsche Bank over there in Germany.
[03:54:07.675 --> 03:54:08.555]  Yeah, it's a big bank.
[03:54:09.326 --> 03:54:12.287]  One of the biggest in the world.
[03:54:12.287 --> 03:54:16.368]  Laying off 18,000 people.
[03:54:16.368 --> 03:54:19.149]  Commerce Bank.
[03:54:19.149 --> 03:54:21.430]  One bank after another.
[03:54:21.430 --> 03:54:23.931]  Laying off people.
[03:54:23.931 --> 03:54:33.994]  And although we see the markets going up, according to the latest reports coming out, buybacks have increased, stock buybacks, by some 23%.
[03:54:37.814 --> 03:54:41.377]  And trading volume is low.
[03:54:41.377 --> 03:54:46.922]  And although money's coming back in, there's still great concern.
[03:54:46.922 --> 03:54:51.486]  So what we're saying is, prepare for the future.
[03:54:51.486 --> 03:54:55.790]  And on another note, Veterans Day.
[03:54:55.790 --> 03:55:04.257]  And I just saw a report that most veterans believe the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan weren't worth fighting.
[03:55:05.988 --> 03:55:06.928]  Majority of U.S.
[03:55:06.928 --> 03:55:18.592]  military veterans say America's most recent wars were not worth fighting, according to results of a Pew Research Center study.
[03:55:18.592 --> 03:55:35.537]  It comes down to, when it comes to the, this is their language, when it comes to the global war on terror, roughly two-thirds of veterans, 64%, say they think the war in Iraq was not worth fighting in light
[03:55:36.437 --> 03:55:44.861]  Of, quote, the costs versus the benefits to the United States.
[03:55:44.861 --> 03:55:46.922]  And let us also look at the numbers.
[03:55:46.922 --> 03:55:47.403]  What is it?
[03:55:47.403 --> 03:55:54.907]  Some 20 to 22 veterans are committing suicide a day.
[03:55:54.907 --> 03:55:59.029]  This is a tragedy and it's immoral.
[03:55:59.029 --> 03:56:02.230]  I hear all these liberals around me near Woodstock over here.
[03:56:02.230 --> 03:56:04.872]  It's 15 minutes from Kingston, Kingston, New York.
[03:56:04.872 --> 03:56:05.452]  And by the way,
[03:56:06.018 --> 03:56:09.040]  Kingston, where we are over here, what press?
[03:56:09.040 --> 03:56:13.922]  Put in Kingston, The Guardian, the English newspaper.
[03:56:13.922 --> 03:56:17.004]  Put in Kingston, In Vogue magazine.
[03:56:17.004 --> 03:56:18.684]  Kingston is the hot spot.
[03:56:18.684 --> 03:56:25.948]  Anyway, 15 minutes northwest of here is Woodstock.
[03:56:25.948 --> 03:56:29.490]  Oh, we abandoned the Kurds in Syria, all the liberals say.
[03:56:30.635 --> 03:56:32.736]  You're there illegally!
[03:56:32.736 --> 03:56:35.237]  Can anybody say the word illegally?
[03:56:35.237 --> 03:56:40.379]  The Iraq War, an illegal war, the Afghan War, these are illegal!
[03:56:40.379 --> 03:56:46.922]  And the people that suffer for it in our country are the troops.
[03:56:46.922 --> 03:56:51.104]  And they're saying they don't want to suffer anymore.
[03:56:51.104 --> 03:56:54.245]  So consider occupying peace.
[03:56:54.245 --> 03:56:56.746]  WWW-OCCUPYPEACE.
[03:56:56.746 --> 03:56:58.787]  The people are against these wars as well.
[03:57:00.043 --> 03:57:03.966]  It's time to bring liberty, love, joy, and beauty back to America.
[03:57:03.966 --> 03:57:05.227]  Not fear and terror.
[03:57:05.227 --> 03:57:07.048]  That's not my trip.
[03:57:07.048 --> 03:57:12.952]  And I know it's not yours because you wouldn't be listening to InfoWars.
[03:57:12.952 --> 03:57:20.357]  And again, the Trends Journal used to be a monthly, first a quarterly, and now it's a weekly.
[03:57:20.357 --> 03:57:23.340]  No magazine in the world like it.
[03:57:23.340 --> 03:57:25.721]  If there is, let us know.
[03:57:25.721 --> 03:57:29.324]  But again, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:57:30.680 --> 03:57:35.025]  And do what you can to change for a better future.
[03:57:35.025 --> 03:57:42.292]  Remember, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen on setting brush fires.
