[00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.080]  Okay.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.981]  Here's what's happening right now.
[00:00:56.981 --> 00:01:01.924]  I've been getting prepared for this broadcast for hours today.
[00:01:01.924 --> 00:01:08.328]  And so much is breaking right as we go on air that I am basically speechless.
[00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:11.550]  That's not something I'm known for.
[00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.755]  We have really a particularly powerful broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:26.653]  on this Wednesday, May 15th, 2019 global transmission.
[00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:38.083]  And we have Soph, the 14-year-old young lady whose parents have given her permission to take off from school today to give us a big exclusive live interview because she's not being scripted.
[00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:40.365]  She's not being handed talking points.
[00:01:40.365 --> 00:01:41.486]  She's extremely smart.
[00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:44.517]  And it's very refreshing.
[00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:47.698]  She probably has an IQ twice that of AOC.
[00:01:47.698 --> 00:01:53.441]  And so she's going to be joining us live, unscripted, on air today.
[00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:58.343]  And we look forward to that because the thought police over at BuzzFeed, you know, the villains,
[00:02:00.282 --> 00:02:05.105]  They've been running around tattletaling on her and trying to get her removed.
[00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:10.487]  And YouTube has been taking action and removing her videos, giving her strikes.
[00:02:10.487 --> 00:02:12.869]  And well, BuzzFeed says, good job.
[00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:17.711]  Now completely de-platform her for life.
[00:02:17.711 --> 00:02:21.193]  Get her web ID or Google ID and ban her.
[00:02:21.193 --> 00:02:23.114]  Do not let her talk.
[00:02:23.114 --> 00:02:24.395]  Shut her up.
[00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:27.297]  She's dangerous.
[00:02:27.297 --> 00:02:27.877]  Shut her up now.
[00:02:30.854 --> 00:02:35.056]  Again, Tucker Carlson said these people aren't scary or anything.
[00:02:35.056 --> 00:02:37.797]  It's the little girl.
[00:02:37.797 --> 00:02:39.277]  But I just said girl.
[00:02:39.277 --> 00:02:41.158]  That infers that some people might not be a girl.
[00:02:41.158 --> 00:02:45.139]  I'm not talking about her, but I just... Well, I just committed a thought crime.
[00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.680]  And you know, we can joke about this all day.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.261]  These people are serious.
[00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.039]  They are the threat.
[00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.640]  You know, Hitler and the Soviet Union was the threat last century.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.302]  We're definitely run by the bad guys at the universities and the Hollywood level.
[00:03:02.302 --> 00:03:04.342]  And more and more people are getting it.
[00:03:04.342 --> 00:03:13.504]  There's a very powerful article up on Infowars.com dealing with a man that they're calling Trump 2.0.
[00:03:13.504 --> 00:03:14.785]  And I was already familiar with him.
[00:03:14.785 --> 00:03:15.505]  I already knew what he did.
[00:03:15.505 --> 00:03:18.946]  He's Attorney General of Missouri, the show me state.
[00:03:18.946 --> 00:03:19.786]  And I was already a fan.
[00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:42.589]  But then I kind of went on a binge on Josh Hawley last night and this morning and probably watched two hours of him in Congress in speeches and I'm telling you, he'll give Ted Cruz or Rand Paul a big run for their money at 39 years old.
[00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:46.071]  This guy and people like him are the future.
[00:03:46.071 --> 00:03:49.453]  He's populist and he gets the fact that
[00:03:51.803 --> 00:03:59.370]  The Democrats are working with foreign governments and combines to act as governments to usurp our freedoms.
[00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:08.978]  And so this whole Brookings Institution, you know, libertarian type idea of get out of the way of corporations is suicide.
[00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:22.373]  Because if the corporations are working with the CHICOMS and the EU, by extension with regulations that we then go under, the government not getting involved is the same as the government ending free speech and getting involved.
[00:04:22.373 --> 00:04:26.436]  And it's simple little mind games the globalists play.
[00:04:26.436 --> 00:04:27.416]  Simple little mind games.
[00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:30.579]  You know, he's top of his class lawyer, whole nine yards.
[00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:34.461]  But you're going to hear his speeches, you're going to say, that sounds exactly like Alex Jones.
[00:04:34.461 --> 00:04:36.362]  That's exactly what Alex Jones is saying.
[00:04:36.362 --> 00:04:38.744]  Because it's what's going on.
[00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:39.645]  Anybody can look at
[00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:42.037]  A pink pig.
[00:04:42.037 --> 00:04:44.900]  And say that's a pink pig.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.704]  Anybody can look at what the EU and the UN and Hollywood, the Democrats are doing.
[00:04:48.704 --> 00:04:49.825]  They're running roughshod.
[00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:52.207]  They're a bunch of tyrants.
[00:04:52.207 --> 00:04:54.129]  Lock their asses up, man.
[00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.530]  Jeez.
[00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.993]  I mean, this is survival we're talking about.
[00:04:57.993 --> 00:04:59.495]  Silicon Valley needs to be raided.
[00:05:00.543 --> 00:05:02.044]  Let's shut down our speech!
[00:05:02.044 --> 00:05:07.549]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:15.055]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:16.357]  Are you coming back?
[00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:17.498]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:18.078 --> 00:05:19.479]  We're at NewsWars.com.
[00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.740]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.721]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[00:05:23.721 --> 00:05:28.483]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[00:05:28.483 --> 00:05:30.724]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:05:30.724 --> 00:05:34.006]  InfoWars.com, man!
[00:05:34.006 --> 00:05:34.366]  Woo!
[00:05:37.097 --> 00:05:39.860]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.681]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:44.403]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:46.625]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:50.148]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[00:05:50.148 --> 00:05:52.871]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:55.293]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:05:55.293 --> 00:05:56.154]  That's where they find it.
[00:05:56.154 --> 00:05:58.115]  You know, there's things called websites.
[00:05:58.115 --> 00:05:58.536]  Just go there.
[00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:16.501]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:28.277 --> 00:06:46.901]  Well, the 14-year-old who's exploded in the last few months, with hundreds of millions of views on YouTube, a million subscribers, is the next person to be digitally crucified, then burned into ashes, and scattered to the four winds, like Winston Smith at the end of 1984.
[00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:57.123]  And she's going to be joining us, coming up, ladies and gentlemen, on the broadcast today.
[00:06:57.123 --> 00:06:57.783]  In the second hour.
[00:06:58.638 --> 00:07:07.183]  Mike Adams is going to be hosting the 4th Hour War Room after that, 3 o'clock central, with the great Owen Troyer.
[00:07:07.183 --> 00:07:09.324]  This is going to be a very important broadcast today.
[00:07:09.324 --> 00:07:28.136]  I've done a lot of research, a lot of preparation for the topics I want to get into and the points I want to make, and I really want to get these salvos out there, because if people listen, if people research, if they find out I'm telling the truth, and then if we take action collectively, it's bye-bye New World Order and hello prosperity!
[00:07:29.804 --> 00:07:43.926]  Because the globalists admit they have been purposely sabotaging, purposely demoralizing, and pumping cultural poison into the system because they can't run a free, open, virtuous people.
[00:07:45.114 --> 00:07:46.694]  I know that's really simple.
[00:07:46.694 --> 00:07:50.875]  A free people can't be enslaved by authoritarians.
[00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:54.176]  So they want us to be slaves.
[00:07:54.176 --> 00:08:06.158]  And the credo of slaves is ignorance, it's backbiting, it's stupidity, it's feeling like you're victims, so you lay down and die instead of overcoming.
[00:08:06.158 --> 00:08:09.298]  And there is a war against the middle of the country.
[00:08:09.298 --> 00:08:12.139]  And I don't just mean that geographically, there's that too.
[00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:13.219]  There is a war.
[00:08:14.045 --> 00:08:15.066]  And everybody already knows this.
[00:08:15.066 --> 00:08:20.590]  When I say this, you're going to say, Jones just said the grass is green.
[00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:30.717]  I know, but the enemy is obsessed with this, the enemy admits this, and now they've gotten so freaked out that we're fighting back that they've uncloaked themselves.
[00:08:30.717 --> 00:08:32.678]  Because they don't get how we operate.
[00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.299]  They've miscalculated.
[00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.401]  They've thrown a lot of kindling on this blaze.
[00:08:38.835 --> 00:08:42.597]  They want you to worship Hollywood.
[00:08:42.597 --> 00:08:45.098]  They want you to worship their emptiness.
[00:08:45.098 --> 00:08:48.400]  They want control of everything because they have no control.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.721]  They want power because they don't have power.
[00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:51.922]  Inherently.
[00:08:51.922 --> 00:08:56.084]  No matter how much power they've got, it's like a colander, the water just pours out.
[00:08:56.084 --> 00:08:58.306]  It's like a boat with holes in it.
[00:08:58.306 --> 00:08:59.786]  And this happens throughout history.
[00:08:59.786 --> 00:09:00.767]  It's known psychology.
[00:09:03.123 --> 00:09:16.909]  And so the left runs the gambit from arrested development fools, low IQ minions, slaves, right up through mercenaries, control freaks, absolutely evil people.
[00:09:16.909 --> 00:09:18.769]  And it runs that spectrum.
[00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:24.792]  And we have to fully come to Jesus on that.
[00:09:24.792 --> 00:09:27.473]  And understand that we are blind.
[00:09:29.912 --> 00:09:33.533]  To the way they operate, because we don't think like that.
[00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:37.834]  We have a blind spot the size of the Grand Canyon.
[00:09:37.834 --> 00:09:47.877]  And once you finally understand, oh my God, there are really evil people in the world, and how they operate, then we can start beating them.
[00:09:47.877 --> 00:09:50.378]  And look, I know you know there's evil people.
[00:09:50.378 --> 00:09:58.900]  But you've got to realize that a lot of evil people aren't gonna climb in to your daughter's bedroom at night and slit their throat.
[00:09:59.744 --> 00:10:01.386]  Those psychos exist.
[00:10:01.386 --> 00:10:02.627]  I don't want to play that clip on Friday.
[00:10:02.627 --> 00:10:03.128]  I never played it.
[00:10:03.128 --> 00:10:03.708]  Let's cue that up.
[00:10:03.708 --> 00:10:06.652]  That's serial killer.
[00:10:06.652 --> 00:10:09.355]  For later in the hour.
[00:10:09.355 --> 00:10:18.585]  But there's a lot of other cowardly evil people that set up systems of corruption and oppression so they can get away with carrying it out in an institutional system.
[00:10:19.815 --> 00:10:34.023]  And then those of us that are trying to just have good country and healthy people and live a long time and love God and have justice and we believe in success and we like other people's success and we like our success because we're confident, we're strong, we come from, you know, good gene pools basically.
[00:10:34.023 --> 00:10:36.224]  We are blind to these people.
[00:10:36.224 --> 00:10:39.265]  But I'm telling you, once you've seen their ass, you're never blind again.
[00:10:39.265 --> 00:10:46.449]  And every fiber of your soul will be, get them off our back.
[00:10:46.449 --> 00:10:49.251]  So that's where I'm coming from here today is, I know you know this.
[00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:57.631]  But they're as evil as we thought they were and more.
[00:10:57.631 --> 00:11:01.579]  And they are seeking always to have power and control over us.
[00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:11.608]  And they want to extinguish what makes us great, because that greatness inherently threatens the corrupt, upside-down system they're trying to build.
[00:11:11.608 --> 00:11:13.568]  They can't have a successful America.
[00:11:13.568 --> 00:11:16.269]  They can't have successful race relations.
[00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:22.310]  They can't have good, strong families and culture, because that threatens their strategic takeover, and they admit that.
[00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.211]  And I know you know that!
[00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:32.473]  But every moment of every day, in everything we do, we have to remember they are literally out to get us.
[00:11:35.785 --> 00:11:40.567]  And so instead of being victims, we're overcomers.
[00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:49.089]  But you have to overcome the enemy by declaring them the enemy and saying to the enemy, I see you.
[00:11:49.089 --> 00:11:51.250]  I know you're bad.
[00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.911]  I know you don't have a conscience.
[00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:54.451]  You know I have one.
[00:11:54.451 --> 00:11:56.692]  So you spend all day trying to manipulate me.
[00:11:56.692 --> 00:11:58.672]  Get behind me, Satan.
[00:11:58.672 --> 00:11:59.913]  You're not in my life anymore.
[00:12:00.603 --> 00:12:02.024]  You don't scare me.
[00:12:02.024 --> 00:12:03.344]  You don't bully me.
[00:12:03.344 --> 00:12:05.986]  Your labels, your lies, it means nothing to me.
[00:12:05.986 --> 00:12:08.987]  I'm standing firm against you.
[00:12:08.987 --> 00:12:12.069]  And I'm going to confront you to your face.
[00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:16.611]  It isn't just Alex Jones that has to go to Congress when they have big tech hearings.
[00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:21.514]  I'll be at every one I'm physically able to be at.
[00:12:21.514 --> 00:12:25.276]  The moment you decide to look at your calendar and take your vacation in DC,
[00:12:27.048 --> 00:12:35.550]  To take your children with you and to march in there when you see Sundar Pichai, or you see Oliver Darcy, or you see any of these liars.
[00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.971]  And you get in their face, because they're the usurpers.
[00:12:38.971 --> 00:12:41.952]  They're bigger than a government.
[00:12:41.952 --> 00:12:55.715]  And they've set themselves up as our kings now, and induced us through telecommunications to make them the new communications system, where they spy on us and sell our data and lie to us, and then when they get caught, they lie to us again,
[00:12:57.817 --> 00:13:03.380]  And just keep trying this Jedi mind trick of we're a private company, we're a private company.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.302]  No, what you are is a trust.
[00:13:06.302 --> 00:13:13.686]  What you are is a criminal combine working with other groups in an oligopoly to control and dominate this nation.
[00:13:13.686 --> 00:13:26.233]  You have disdain for people that don't want to be in Hollywood, that don't want to worship Silicon Valley, and you're taking over every facet of our lives and pumping us full of poison so you can feed on us at your leisure.
[00:13:28.427 --> 00:13:30.969]  And it's coming to an end.
[00:13:30.969 --> 00:13:33.592]  We're going to break up all of these tech monopolies.
[00:13:33.592 --> 00:13:36.294]  We're going to pull the Chi-Com operatives out of our government.
[00:13:36.294 --> 00:13:38.216]  There's going to be thousands of people arrested.
[00:13:38.216 --> 00:13:39.698]  Already hundreds have been.
[00:13:39.698 --> 00:13:48.646]  We're going to roll up Hollywood, and we're going to roll all of you up because you're a cancer, you're an enemy force, and you're working against this nation.
[00:13:48.646 --> 00:13:50.608]  Remember a few months ago?
[00:13:54.059 --> 00:14:01.306]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff got asked in Congress about Google officially working for China and won't even work with our own military.
[00:14:01.306 --> 00:14:02.647]  What does that tell you?
[00:14:02.647 --> 00:14:05.049]  They hate America!
[00:14:05.049 --> 00:14:16.140]  You go to any Democratic Party event, any Silicon Valley event, and you talk about loving America or free market or God, they will groan, they will yell at you, and they will say, get out of here!
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.963]  They will physically attack you in public spaces!
[00:14:20.967 --> 00:14:22.469]  They are so habituated.
[00:14:22.469 --> 00:14:24.893]  They hate you so much.
[00:14:24.893 --> 00:14:27.277]  They hate Jesus Christ so much.
[00:14:27.277 --> 00:14:35.029]  They hate families so much that they shake with murderous delight.
[00:14:37.845 --> 00:14:43.108]  I mean, I knew they hated America, but the last few years I go out to these events and I say, Hey, America's back.
[00:14:43.108 --> 00:14:48.710]  You know, it's, you know, unemployment's down and, and good things are happening and they start groaning.
[00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.731]  And I say, I love America.
[00:14:50.731 --> 00:15:00.596]  And they go, and you're like, so you do it to another group and another group and another group.
[00:15:00.596 --> 00:15:01.436]  And they're all the same.
[00:15:04.622 --> 00:15:07.744]  And it's like, you have to understand, these are really bad people.
[00:15:07.744 --> 00:15:13.589]  And they've converted a large number of our fellow citizens into this now.
[00:15:13.589 --> 00:15:15.210]  They're basically demon possessed.
[00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.731]  I don't know what you want to call it.
[00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:18.112]  Mass psychosis.
[00:15:18.112 --> 00:15:19.553]  It's going on.
[00:15:19.553 --> 00:15:20.674]  It's happening.
[00:15:20.674 --> 00:15:21.895]  We've all seen it.
[00:15:21.895 --> 00:15:22.976]  It's like the body snatchers.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:33.384]  And we're going to have to stand against them and stop acquiescing to their bullying, or it's only going to get worse.
[00:15:33.384 --> 00:15:35.945]  And you can see there's no limit to what they'll do.
[00:15:35.945 --> 00:15:47.871]  The good news is there are a bunch of evil people on top, but still a small number, with a lot of victims and mind-controlled, servile, mass brainwashed followers.
[00:15:49.292 --> 00:15:53.361]  But we have to come into that power vacuum and lead and stop all this.
[00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:55.565]  We'll lay the plan out and stop it on the other side.
[00:15:55.565 --> 00:15:57.449]  However you're listening, please spread the word.
[00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:00.792]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.792 --> 00:16:04.713]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:06.234]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:06.234 --> 00:16:09.216]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:09.216 --> 00:16:14.758]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:14.758 --> 00:16:15.959]  I can help you, too.
[00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:18.900]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:35.469]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:16:35.469 --> 00:16:38.511]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:16:38.511 --> 00:16:44.435]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:16:44.435 --> 00:16:48.218]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:16:48.218 --> 00:16:49.499]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:16:49.499 --> 00:16:50.840]  Who do we fight for?
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:57.044]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[00:18:00.228 --> 00:18:03.811]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:05.593]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.593 --> 00:18:16.862]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.643 --> 00:18:26.829]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.829 --> 00:18:32.613]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.613 --> 00:18:37.876]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.876 --> 00:18:40.138]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.498 --> 00:18:42.199]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.199 --> 00:18:52.203]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.203 --> 00:18:54.864]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.864 --> 00:18:59.566]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:06.026 --> 00:19:10.429]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border, talks about MS-13 and more.
[00:19:10.429 --> 00:19:11.409]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[00:19:11.409 --> 00:19:11.869]  Yes, sir.
[00:19:11.869 --> 00:19:13.170]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.271]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:21.194]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sports shirts, all the equipment.
[00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:23.135]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[00:19:23.135 --> 00:19:24.096]  God bless you, brother.
[00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:30.879]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody, just to help spread that word.
[00:19:31.099 --> 00:19:32.320]  You're our only hope, brother.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.522]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[00:19:34.522 --> 00:19:37.264]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[00:20:03.392 --> 00:20:09.795]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:09.795 --> 00:20:16.277]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[00:20:16.277 --> 00:20:19.598]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread!
[00:20:19.598 --> 00:20:23.019]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[00:20:23.019 --> 00:20:25.600]  And we're beholden to scum!
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.301]  Russian scum!
[00:20:34.497 --> 00:20:35.917]  Please, listen.
[00:20:35.917 --> 00:20:44.240]  If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.361]  The function of all life is survival.
[00:20:48.361 --> 00:20:50.361]  Sleep.
[00:20:50.361 --> 00:20:52.302]  Sleep.
[00:20:52.302 --> 00:20:53.802]  Sleep.
[00:20:53.802 --> 00:20:54.622]  Oh my God!
[00:20:54.622 --> 00:20:55.523]  Oh my God!
[00:20:55.523 --> 00:20:55.983]  Oh my God!
[00:20:55.983 --> 00:20:56.523]  Lock the door!
[00:20:56.523 --> 00:20:57.663]  Lock the door!
[00:20:57.663 --> 00:20:59.964]  They're coming!
[00:20:59.964 --> 00:21:00.924]  They're coming!
[00:21:00.924 --> 00:21:01.224]  Help!
[00:21:01.224 --> 00:21:01.404]  Help!
[00:21:01.404 --> 00:21:01.964]  They're coming!
[00:21:01.964 --> 00:21:02.585]  They're coming!
[00:21:02.585 --> 00:21:03.045]  Listen to me!
[00:21:03.045 --> 00:21:03.325]  Listen!
[00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:03.745]  Tell me!
[00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:05.611]  Please!
[00:21:05.611 --> 00:21:06.232]  Please!
[00:21:06.232 --> 00:21:07.633]  Your legs are in danger!
[00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:08.693]  Please, listen to me!
[00:21:08.693 --> 00:21:09.874]  It's something terrible!
[00:21:09.874 --> 00:21:10.754]  Please!
[00:21:10.754 --> 00:21:12.716]  Your legs are in the air!
[00:21:12.716 --> 00:21:15.017]  They're already here!
[00:21:15.017 --> 00:21:15.217]  Help!
[00:21:15.217 --> 00:21:15.597]  Your legs!
[00:21:15.597 --> 00:21:16.098]  They're coming!
[00:21:16.098 --> 00:21:17.539]  They're coming!
[00:21:17.539 --> 00:21:18.379]  Sleep.
[00:21:18.379 --> 00:21:19.520]  The seed is planted.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.461]  Sleep.
[00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:22.401]  Sleep.
[00:21:22.401 --> 00:21:23.602]  Terror grows.
[00:21:23.602 --> 00:21:25.723]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[00:21:25.723 --> 00:21:27.625]  We'll get you when you sleep!
[00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:29.005]  Sit up!
[00:21:29.005 --> 00:21:31.147]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[00:21:32.632 --> 00:21:34.854]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites.
[00:21:34.854 --> 00:21:36.395]  Is it contagious?
[00:21:36.395 --> 00:21:38.176]  It looked right at me.
[00:21:38.176 --> 00:21:39.277]  You need to get out!
[00:21:39.277 --> 00:21:41.599]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[00:21:41.599 --> 00:21:44.601]  It was not human.
[00:21:44.601 --> 00:21:47.783]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[00:21:47.783 --> 00:21:49.565]  We're being cornered!
[00:21:49.565 --> 00:21:52.707]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[00:21:52.707 --> 00:21:53.968]  They're barricading us.
[00:22:19.955 --> 00:22:24.958]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:30.302]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:22:30.302 --> 00:22:35.886]  And we got a giant beachhead two and a half years ago when Trump got elected.
[00:22:35.886 --> 00:22:37.086]  We'd relaunched America.
[00:22:37.086 --> 00:22:40.549]  This audience, you had done it.
[00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:42.050]  1776 had a beachhead.
[00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:45.252]  So the enemy said, okay, shut him down.
[00:22:45.252 --> 00:22:46.813]  We'll call ourselves the resistance.
[00:22:48.823 --> 00:22:53.947]  And we'll try to adopt a lot of Jones's populist tactics, but we'll invert it.
[00:22:53.947 --> 00:22:56.048]  And that's why they want us off the air.
[00:22:56.048 --> 00:22:58.090]  They are now the resistance.
[00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.252]  Well, yeah, you're the resistance to America.
[00:23:00.252 --> 00:23:01.032]  You're the globalist.
[00:23:01.032 --> 00:23:02.433]  America was never great.
[00:23:02.433 --> 00:23:05.155]  It'll never be great.
[00:23:05.155 --> 00:23:17.464]  And now President Trump has basically stood down his one biggest failure so far and not defended the First Amendment against the monopoly combine activities
[00:23:18.527 --> 00:23:25.429]  A big tech openly and publicly moving to China just on the national security front.
[00:23:25.429 --> 00:23:31.091]  He's done something on Huawei, he's done something on 5G, and now that's a major national security threat.
[00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:43.295]  But if you don't think every Apple device having its code access based in China on servers that Apple admits are state controlled so Apple can be tax exempt.
[00:23:45.336 --> 00:23:51.501]  And then the Pentagon is like, well, I guess none of you will work with us, Apple or Google or anybody else.
[00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:54.083]  Amazon works for the Pentagon.
[00:23:54.083 --> 00:23:56.025]  I guess that's your right.
[00:23:56.025 --> 00:23:57.906]  But, gee, it's kind of bad.
[00:23:57.906 --> 00:23:59.748]  Your right?
[00:23:59.748 --> 00:24:03.011]  To move to China and let them have all our damn codes?
[00:24:03.011 --> 00:24:04.512]  No, that's not their right.
[00:24:04.512 --> 00:24:07.334]  You're a private company.
[00:24:07.334 --> 00:24:10.076]  The Libertarian Institute said so.
[00:24:10.076 --> 00:24:13.179]  Libertarianism isn't what big corporations say it is.
[00:24:13.179 --> 00:24:14.220]  It isn't slitting your throat.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.043]  By our government letting China and the EU write all the regulations.
[00:24:22.043 --> 00:24:27.247]  They've written them now to make big tech move over there and do what they say.
[00:24:27.247 --> 00:24:36.533]  I'm going to say it again, because our government won't defend us and won't regulate to prohibit foreign regulation and won't protect what we built.
[00:24:36.533 --> 00:24:42.477]  You have given it over and you're going to let them steal 2020.
[00:24:42.477 --> 00:24:43.678]  Trump's going to lose.
[00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:46.942]  And they're just going to ban everybody.
[00:24:46.942 --> 00:24:48.702]  That's where we are right now.
[00:24:48.702 --> 00:24:50.723]  I told you Trump was going to win.
[00:24:50.723 --> 00:24:52.984]  He's going to lose.
[00:24:52.984 --> 00:24:54.284]  Mark my words.
[00:24:54.284 --> 00:25:00.087]  I think Trump's got six months to tear the hell out of Big Tech and bloody their nose politically.
[00:25:00.087 --> 00:25:01.487]  And scare the hell out of them.
[00:25:01.487 --> 00:25:04.148]  They've got all sorts of stuff to indict these heads.
[00:25:04.148 --> 00:25:08.310]  Big Tech's been acting like they're invincible above the law god.
[00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.550]  We don't have a lot of time.
[00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.551]  We need serious measures.
[00:25:11.551 --> 00:25:14.032]  Are the only measures that will do anything.
[00:25:17.199 --> 00:25:36.552]  I'm not an authoritarian, but if our taxpayers and our engineers built Google, built Apple, built YouTube, built Twitter, now they're these piss-on-America, we-hate-America leftists, the normal response, you know if Russian companies just handed their stuff over to foreign
[00:25:37.423 --> 00:25:38.904]  Countries.
[00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:42.766]  Those executives would all be found dead in their beds in a week.
[00:25:42.766 --> 00:25:44.347]  I mean, you know that, right?
[00:25:44.347 --> 00:25:47.528]  They'd get run over in the street, they'd get shot, they'd get poisoned.
[00:25:47.528 --> 00:25:49.369]  That's not authoritarianism.
[00:25:49.369 --> 00:25:52.831]  That's not slitting your children's throats, is what that is.
[00:25:52.831 --> 00:25:53.531]  So, fine!
[00:25:53.531 --> 00:25:55.812]  I mean, good, let's just give the chi-coms everything!
[00:25:55.812 --> 00:25:57.253]  Holy mackerel!
[00:25:57.253 --> 00:26:00.235]  They've only killed 120 million people!
[00:26:00.235 --> 00:26:01.856]  Here, just give Hitler all the codes!
[00:26:01.856 --> 00:26:03.116]  Hell, get the time machine!
[00:26:03.116 --> 00:26:06.338]  Go back and give Hitler the internet, hydrogen bombs, just give him everything!
[00:26:07.227 --> 00:26:09.729]  Let's just roll over!
[00:26:09.729 --> 00:26:11.750]  And I don't wish any harm against the big tech people.
[00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:13.131]  I don't want to have a hot war.
[00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:16.113]  These people are already crapping all over us.
[00:26:16.113 --> 00:26:17.994]  They've already sold us out so far.
[00:26:17.994 --> 00:26:19.335]  It's insane!
[00:26:21.021 --> 00:26:25.705]  And we can't even get the Pentagon to get more than a little upset about it.
[00:26:25.705 --> 00:26:27.146]  Protect our country.
[00:26:27.146 --> 00:26:29.688]  It isn't about aircraft carriers and missiles.
[00:26:29.688 --> 00:26:33.110]  It's about money and communications and telecommunications.
[00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.131]  That's more important.
[00:26:34.131 --> 00:26:35.792]  That's 90% of war.
[00:26:35.792 --> 00:26:40.516]  And we don't have control of our own Internet!
[00:26:40.516 --> 00:26:42.718]  Oh, that we built.
[00:26:42.718 --> 00:26:47.802]  Here is Senator, a month ago, bringing this up to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
[00:26:47.802 --> 00:26:48.042]  Here it is.
[00:26:49.662 --> 00:26:53.065]  So, I just want to make sure that I understand exactly what you're saying.
[00:26:53.065 --> 00:27:07.495]  You're telling me that Google, an American company, supposedly, is refusing to work with the Department of Defense, but is doing work with China, in China, in a way that at least indirectly benefits the Chinese government.
[00:27:07.495 --> 00:27:09.616]  Is that correct?
[00:27:09.616 --> 00:27:16.541]  I haven't heard the word refuse, but there's a lack of willingness to support DoD programs.
[00:27:16.541 --> 00:27:17.522]  General, you're nodding your head.
[00:27:17.522 --> 00:27:18.343]  Do you want to weigh in on this?
[00:27:19.275 --> 00:27:29.886]  No, Senator, I'm nodding your head on exactly the point that you made, that the work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military.
[00:27:29.886 --> 00:27:33.310]  And I've been very public on this issue as well.
[00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:37.954]  In fact, the way I described it to our industry partners is, look, we're the good guys in the
[00:27:38.715 --> 00:27:46.276]  The values that we represent and the system that we represent is the one that will allow and has allowed you to thrive.
[00:27:46.276 --> 00:27:48.137]  And that's the way I've characterized it.
[00:27:48.137 --> 00:27:53.358]  So I was just nodding that what the Secretary was articulating is a general sense of all of us as leaders.
[00:27:53.358 --> 00:28:00.059]  And we watch with great concern when industry partners work in China, knowing that there is that indirect benefit.
[00:28:00.059 --> 00:28:05.119]  And frankly, indirect may be not a full characterization of the way it really is.
[00:28:05.119 --> 00:28:07.520]  It's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military.
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:29.218]  I just want to underscore this for the record so that we are absolutely, perfectly, 100% clear here that Google, an American company based in this country, again, supposedly an American company, is doing work in China that directly or indirectly benefits the Chinese government at a time of increased peer competition with this country.
[00:28:29.218 --> 00:28:31.179]  We are in a struggle.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:40.246]  with the Chinese government over whether or not they're going to become a regional and maybe global hegemon with values very different from ours.
[00:28:40.246 --> 00:28:43.668]  Certainly values that do not favor freedom in the world.
[00:28:43.668 --> 00:28:50.052]  And we have an American company that does not want to do work with our Defense Department, which is one thing, but... That's because they're traitors!
[00:28:50.052 --> 00:28:52.073]  It's called globalism!
[00:28:52.073 --> 00:28:53.975]  The Democrats want to destroy the country.
[00:28:53.975 --> 00:28:55.476]  They sold out the foreign powers.
[00:28:55.476 --> 00:28:56.096]  Period!
[00:28:56.096 --> 00:28:57.217]  Wake up or the country's done!
[00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:01.651]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.651 --> 00:29:06.952]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.952 --> 00:29:08.552]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.552 --> 00:29:16.894]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:16.894 --> 00:29:22.596]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:22.756 --> 00:29:24.597]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:24.597 --> 00:29:26.758]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:26.758 --> 00:29:31.259]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:31.259 --> 00:29:33.440]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:41.303]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:04.140]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.020]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.380]  You are the man, Alex.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.900]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:08.701]  I'm so excited.
[00:30:08.701 --> 00:30:09.601]  I'm such a big fan.
[00:30:09.601 --> 00:30:12.082]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[00:30:12.082 --> 00:30:14.582]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[00:30:14.582 --> 00:30:16.003]  The Bone Broth.
[00:30:16.003 --> 00:30:17.443]  The Bone Broth.
[00:30:17.443 --> 00:30:18.843]  The Bone Broth.
[00:30:18.843 --> 00:30:20.084]  The Bone Broth.
[00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:24.845]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[00:30:24.845 --> 00:30:26.005]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:30:26.005 --> 00:30:27.546]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:30:27.546 --> 00:30:28.826]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:30:29.906 --> 00:30:32.628]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[00:30:32.628 --> 00:30:36.830]  My daughter uses the Bubble Gum Fluoride 3 Toothpaste.
[00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:40.631]  I've used the Super Male Vitality, a host of other products.
[00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:42.652]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[00:30:42.652 --> 00:30:45.213]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products.
[00:30:45.213 --> 00:30:45.974]  I'm thanking you.
[00:30:45.974 --> 00:30:52.417]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:53.237]  It is next level.
[00:30:53.237 --> 00:30:53.797]  It really is good.
[00:30:53.797 --> 00:30:54.358]  So thank you.
[00:30:54.358 --> 00:30:56.299]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[00:30:56.299 --> 00:30:56.659]  Thank you.

[00:31:51.417 --> 00:31:53.918]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today!
[00:32:00.111 --> 00:32:13.557]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[00:32:13.557 --> 00:32:24.603]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[00:32:25.917 --> 00:32:27.843]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[00:32:27.843 --> 00:32:30.513]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[00:32:31.903 --> 00:32:36.205]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[00:32:36.205 --> 00:32:40.468]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[00:32:40.468 --> 00:32:42.749]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[00:32:42.749 --> 00:32:45.071]  This country is in a war!
[00:32:45.071 --> 00:32:55.757]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[00:32:55.757 --> 00:32:59.339]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[00:33:03.331 --> 00:33:14.375]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.375 --> 00:33:17.336]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:33.923 --> 00:33:45.270]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:45.270 --> 00:34:01.100]  So, imagine the arrogance of big tech globally, working together in concert to censor nationalists, populists, whether they be right-wing or left-wing, if they want their countries to be run by them.
[00:34:02.612 --> 00:34:12.099]  Right now you've got Facebook admittedly interfering and blocking populist parties in major elections in Spain, in Italy, everywhere and admitting they're doing it.
[00:34:12.099 --> 00:34:21.066]  Facebook has announced no live streaming is allowed in Paris on their platform because they don't want you to see what the police do to people.
[00:34:21.066 --> 00:34:22.367]  They don't want you to see the yellow vest.
[00:34:22.367 --> 00:34:25.529]  They don't want you to be able to know what goes on.
[00:34:25.529 --> 00:34:29.312]  That's what authoritarian regimes do.
[00:34:29.312 --> 00:34:31.133]  And they just announce it like they're very
[00:34:32.216 --> 00:34:34.597]  Proud of what they're doing.
[00:34:34.597 --> 00:34:47.001]  And that's what Obama tried three years ago, on the eve of leaving, was to hand full control of the Internet over to the UN, in an advisory body set up by the European Union.
[00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:52.362]  The very robber barons that set up the UN set up the European Union.
[00:34:52.362 --> 00:34:56.544]  And guess where they got the plan?
[00:34:56.544 --> 00:34:57.004]  From Hitler.
[00:34:58.527 --> 00:34:59.087]  Don't believe me?
[00:34:59.087 --> 00:34:59.927]  Just type in.
[00:34:59.927 --> 00:35:05.889]  The EU was a brainchild of Adolf Hitler.
[00:35:05.889 --> 00:35:08.490]  Even the flag Hitler came up with.
[00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.531]  The Olympic symbol Hitler came up with.
[00:35:10.531 --> 00:35:12.572]  The Volkswagen symbol he came up with.
[00:35:12.572 --> 00:35:19.834]  He drew the first Volkswagen Beetle in 1935 on the back of a cocktail napkin.
[00:35:19.834 --> 00:35:22.595]  And all I'm saying is, isn't it amazing?
[00:35:22.595 --> 00:35:24.936]  Autobahns, big highways, Hitler's idea.
[00:35:26.793 --> 00:35:28.934]  And I'm not saying highways are a bad idea.
[00:35:28.934 --> 00:35:36.739]  I'm just simply saying you might want to actually research how authoritarian all this is.
[00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:48.206]  Because when I get up here and I say, you know, the space shuttle was called the Silverbird and was being developed on paper by, who became the head of NASA later, to be a atomic bomber.
[00:35:49.397 --> 00:36:00.504]  That would go up into orbit, turn over, open up the space shuttle, open up its bays, and drop atomic bombs on Manhattan, Detroit, and Chicago.
[00:36:00.504 --> 00:36:02.206]  And that was in its first path.
[00:36:02.206 --> 00:36:10.611]  It was then going to orbit the Earth, get into another angle, to then bomb across the Midwest.
[00:36:10.611 --> 00:36:13.133]  And that's all the atomic bombs they thought they could load in.
[00:36:15.285 --> 00:36:19.308]  You're like, wait a minute, the space shuttle, we invented that, that first flew in 1980 or whatever.
[00:36:19.308 --> 00:36:23.491]  No, my friends, we didn't invent the space shuttle, the Nazis did.
[00:36:23.491 --> 00:36:25.612]  And they were able to create atomic weapons.
[00:36:25.612 --> 00:36:32.657]  But we sent special forces, and the British did, into those mountains and blew them up on suicide missions.
[00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:35.939]  They had dozens of different types of jet aircraft.
[00:36:35.939 --> 00:36:37.840]  They had it all.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.744]  And the point is, is we're not facing a Nazi conspiracy.
[00:36:44.565 --> 00:36:57.371]  There are powerful corporations and powerful individuals that will gobble up anything they can get that other evil people have come up with for evil aims.
[00:36:57.371 --> 00:36:58.852]  And so that's the reality.
[00:36:58.852 --> 00:37:05.275]  We took the space shuttle and used it to resupply the space station and 20% of its missions.
[00:37:05.275 --> 00:37:08.176]  80% were classified and were weapons payloads in space.
[00:37:08.176 --> 00:37:11.078]  That's what the space shuttle does is it takes huge weapons payloads
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:17.523]  X-ray lasers, you name it, into orbit and then places them.
[00:37:17.523 --> 00:37:18.483]  But I'm going to stop there.
[00:37:18.483 --> 00:37:21.245]  I have a problem with the show.
[00:37:21.245 --> 00:37:23.186]  I have massive preparation here.
[00:37:23.186 --> 00:37:29.749]  All this stuff I want to go over, all these things I want to talk about.
[00:37:29.749 --> 00:37:36.533]  But you see I go down the little rabbit trail of Facebook is helping the EU at the request of Macron, who's really an EU minion.
[00:37:37.535 --> 00:37:44.198]  For this big internet tech conference, ban free speech, basically, and ban live video.
[00:37:44.198 --> 00:37:45.818]  Look at this though, that's my whole stack of censorship today.
[00:37:45.818 --> 00:37:50.400]  It's like, China's social credit system blacklists 13 million people so far.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:38:00.564]  Google's censorship search would help China be more open, said CEO of Google.
[00:38:00.564 --> 00:38:03.565]  He runs the parent company now, Alphabet, Eric Schmidt.
[00:38:05.441 --> 00:38:07.543]  That's 2 plus 2 equals 10.
[00:38:07.543 --> 00:38:09.425]  Or being tortured to death is a great liberation.
[00:38:09.425 --> 00:38:10.005]  War is peace.
[00:38:10.005 --> 00:38:10.806]  Freedom is slavery.
[00:38:10.806 --> 00:38:11.907]  Lies are truth.
[00:38:11.907 --> 00:38:17.592]  Google's censored search would help China be more open, said ex-CEO Eric Schmidt.
[00:38:17.592 --> 00:38:20.995]  Isn't that a funny, funny, funny, funny one?
[00:38:20.995 --> 00:38:25.979]  Online encyclopedia Wikipedia blocked in China ahead of Tiananmen anniversary.
[00:38:25.979 --> 00:38:26.660]  That's out of Reuters.
[00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:40.994]  Don't worry, they've locked up a right-wing comedian for making a gay joke he's facing six months in prison and the president thinks that's wrong, so they're calling him hateful.
[00:38:40.994 --> 00:38:44.215]  That's right, you know, this is what happens in other countries.
[00:38:44.215 --> 00:38:47.436]  Oh, under political correctness, Brazil is very politically correct.
[00:38:47.436 --> 00:38:48.977]  Oh my God!
[00:38:48.977 --> 00:38:50.057]  You made a gay joke!
[00:38:50.057 --> 00:38:51.158]  You're going to prison!
[00:38:51.158 --> 00:38:51.978]  Isn't that liberal?
[00:38:55.848 --> 00:38:57.229]  Wow!
[00:38:57.229 --> 00:39:00.371]  I mean, that's without even looking what's going on.
[00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:05.414]  It's everywhere.
[00:39:05.414 --> 00:39:13.979]  You know, I used to laugh at this, but now I'm figuring out the left has their fundraiser letters and their private communications and what goes on.
[00:39:13.979 --> 00:39:19.602]  But about three years ago, I started seeing it on Facebook and YouTube and Twitter everywhere.
[00:39:19.602 --> 00:39:24.064]  They'd say, Alex Jones is being sued by the Sandy Hook families.
[00:39:24.064 --> 00:39:24.925]  I hadn't been sued yet.
[00:39:27.853 --> 00:39:31.234]  And I remember, that's weird, that's not right.
[00:39:31.234 --> 00:39:32.875]  And then they did it.
[00:39:32.875 --> 00:39:41.498]  He just creates this thing of, well, you're supposed to, because the media and the left brings up things I never said in my voice, and then tells people, did you hear what Alex is doing?
[00:39:41.498 --> 00:39:42.278]  Why?
[00:39:42.278 --> 00:39:45.119]  Why, he paid for his college tuition for his kids on you.
[00:39:45.119 --> 00:39:47.680]  Why, he made $80 billion off you.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.960]  Why, he talks about you every day.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.501]  None of that's even true.
[00:39:52.501 --> 00:39:56.963]  And now the new thing is, Alex Jones killed people.
[00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.152]  Alex Jones is a murderer!
[00:40:00.152 --> 00:40:02.053]  Alex Jones is in prison!
[00:40:02.053 --> 00:40:10.539]  And you've seen Millie Weaver and other videos on the street with Kaitlin Benton and others, and people walk up and they go, Alex Jones is in prison for murder!
[00:40:10.539 --> 00:40:20.706]  And we all kind of laugh and go, huh, but see, I guess in their weird group collective or however this thing works, I'm not sure.
[00:40:20.706 --> 00:40:23.708]  They think I'm in prison now!
[00:40:23.708 --> 00:40:27.211]  They said I was being sued by Sandy Hook before I was.
[00:40:28.912 --> 00:40:35.537]  And now they say I'm in prison for murdering people.
[00:40:35.537 --> 00:40:38.378]  People walk up on the street and they go, aren't you supposed to be in prison?
[00:40:38.378 --> 00:40:44.542]  These are crazy people.
[00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:47.905]  But they create whatever insane narrative they want.
[00:40:47.905 --> 00:40:49.586]  It's the death of logic.
[00:40:49.586 --> 00:40:52.908]  It's the death of civilization.
[00:40:52.908 --> 00:40:53.929]  It's completely out of control.
[00:40:53.929 --> 00:40:55.530]  But just let me control myself.
[00:40:56.624 --> 00:40:57.544]  Okay?
[00:40:57.544 --> 00:41:02.085]  Because I've got to get to how we can break up big tech, and it's bigger than just me being censored.
[00:41:02.085 --> 00:41:04.665]  I don't care.
[00:41:04.665 --> 00:41:13.287]  On my knees, if we could just halfway turn the country around, I would stop and, you know, shut this operation down or let Owen run it or something, or Paul Watson if he was interested.
[00:41:13.287 --> 00:41:17.608]  You know, I mean, because there's always something, you know, to do political.
[00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:19.948]  But this is existential threat to everything.
[00:41:19.948 --> 00:41:25.589]  We've got to really be politically engaged and informed now, because facts are
[00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:29.872]  The enemy of our enemy.
[00:41:29.872 --> 00:41:36.035]  Now, I've been very impressed with what they're calling Trumpism 2.0.
[00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:45.160]  Senator Josh Hawley has unveiled populist platform to fight big tech aristocrats and restore America.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:52.624]  And I watched hours of his speeches last night and this morning, and he gave a speech to the Senate earlier that we're going to air excerpts of next hour.
[00:41:54.755 --> 00:41:59.037]  But when you hear these speeches, you're going to say, well, that sounds just like Alex Jones.
[00:41:59.037 --> 00:42:02.279]  No, folks.
[00:42:02.279 --> 00:42:05.381]  What it is, is we're looking at the same thing in history.
[00:42:05.381 --> 00:42:06.681]  I'm quoting founding fathers.
[00:42:06.681 --> 00:42:08.202]  He's quoting founding fathers.
[00:42:08.202 --> 00:42:15.866]  He's quoting Senator Hawley, the same person that a big liberal is.
[00:42:15.866 --> 00:42:21.929]  Mark Zuckerberg's accomplice in founding Facebook has come out.
[00:42:21.929 --> 00:42:22.510]  Chris Hughes.
[00:42:23.826 --> 00:42:29.287]  And said exactly what the Senator's saying.
[00:42:29.287 --> 00:42:32.568]  So, this is the key when we come back.
[00:42:32.568 --> 00:42:39.309]  Get the founder of Facebook saying what the GOP Rising Star Senator's saying.
[00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:40.169]  Because it's common sense.
[00:42:40.169 --> 00:42:44.050]  And you read this and you go, oh my God, that's exactly it.
[00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:47.231]  We have new royalty.
[00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:48.871]  What is royalty?
[00:42:48.871 --> 00:42:49.771]  What does it signify?
[00:42:49.771 --> 00:42:50.571]  What does it mean?
[00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:52.652]  Why did our forebearers reject it?
[00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:55.069]  It's all coming up.
[00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:56.889]  On the other side, InfoWars.com.
[00:42:56.889 --> 00:42:59.230]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:01.491]  They've not shut down our speech!
[00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:06.592]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[00:43:06.592 --> 00:43:14.095]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[00:43:14.095 --> 00:43:15.415]  Are you coming back?
[00:43:15.415 --> 00:43:16.556]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[00:43:17.156 --> 00:43:18.537]  We're at Newshorse.com.
[00:43:18.537 --> 00:43:20.779]  Paul Watts has launched his own Summit.news.
[00:43:20.779 --> 00:43:22.780]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:27.544]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[00:43:27.544 --> 00:43:29.805]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:43:29.805 --> 00:43:33.068]  InfoWars.com, man!
[00:43:33.068 --> 00:43:33.408]  Woo!
[00:43:36.135 --> 00:43:38.877]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[00:43:38.877 --> 00:43:40.738]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[00:43:40.738 --> 00:43:43.779]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:43:43.779 --> 00:43:45.680]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:49.182]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[00:43:49.182 --> 00:43:51.924]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[00:43:51.924 --> 00:43:54.345]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:43:54.345 --> 00:43:55.206]  That's where they find it.
[00:43:55.206 --> 00:43:57.167]  You know, there's things called websites.
[00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:57.587]  Just go there.
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:11.209]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[00:44:11.209 --> 00:44:19.576]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with and that it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[00:44:19.576 --> 00:44:23.699]  Well, thousands of years ago it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:31.289]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally.
[00:44:31.289 --> 00:44:41.984]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[00:44:42.504 --> 00:44:44.746]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[00:44:44.746 --> 00:44:49.609]  It's 50% off right now at InFourStore.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:52.491]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[00:44:52.491 --> 00:45:00.697]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taking on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[00:45:00.697 --> 00:45:03.119]  Stacey in the great state of Texas.
[00:45:04.125 --> 00:45:07.208]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[00:45:19.898 --> 00:45:25.885]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[00:45:25.885 --> 00:45:26.666]  I appreciate that.
[00:45:26.666 --> 00:45:28.247]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[00:45:28.247 --> 00:45:28.788]  Tell us about it.
[00:45:28.788 --> 00:45:29.629]  Well, it's really great.
[00:45:29.629 --> 00:45:30.910]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:31.431]  I take it.
[00:45:31.431 --> 00:45:32.192]  It tastes good.
[00:45:32.192 --> 00:45:34.034]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[00:45:34.034 --> 00:45:35.996]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[00:45:35.996 --> 00:45:39.420]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.323]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[00:45:42.323 --> 00:45:44.084]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[00:45:44.084 --> 00:45:46.146]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[00:45:46.146 --> 00:45:47.067]  So, yeah.
[00:45:47.067 --> 00:45:49.510]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.333]  These are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:53.494]  So, I'm glad you plugged it.
[00:45:53.494 --> 00:45:55.295]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:00.618 --> 00:46:03.819]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.

[00:46:31.432 --> 00:46:33.112]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[00:46:33.112 --> 00:46:35.953]  And we decided, I like Secret 12 Plus.
[00:46:35.953 --> 00:46:39.015]  But they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[00:46:39.015 --> 00:46:39.775]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[00:46:39.775 --> 00:46:40.535]  Well, you know what?
[00:46:40.535 --> 00:46:41.796]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[00:46:41.796 --> 00:46:43.797]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[00:46:43.797 --> 00:46:44.777]  We decided to change the name.
[00:46:44.777 --> 00:46:45.978]  So when you peel off the label...
[00:46:47.198 --> 00:46:50.920]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.722]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.
[00:46:53.722 --> 00:46:55.602]  Better than Secret 12 ever was.
[00:46:55.602 --> 00:47:03.386]  InfoWarsTore.com now back in stock after four months sold out.
[00:47:03.386 --> 00:47:06.028]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.215 --> 00:47:23.139]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:23.139 --> 00:47:27.368]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:27.368 --> 00:47:27.689]  Show!
[00:47:27.689 --> 00:47:28.330]  You know?
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.703]  End of World War II, the British and the U.S.
[00:47:36.703 --> 00:47:45.691]  sent now a lot of famous raids, where in some cases everybody died, in other cases nobody died, to go into the mountains, not of Germany.
[00:47:45.691 --> 00:47:53.138]  The Germans, just like in a Marvel comic movie, had all these underground bases in different nations around Germany in the Alps.
[00:47:54.099 --> 00:48:01.927]  And so groups as small as 10 people, sometimes 100, would ski in 30, 40, 50, 100 miles with weapons.
[00:48:01.927 --> 00:48:03.389]  They'd go in with explosives.
[00:48:03.389 --> 00:48:05.091]  They'd sneak into these bases.
[00:48:05.091 --> 00:48:07.353]  They'd blow them up.
[00:48:07.353 --> 00:48:08.534]  They had atomic bombs.
[00:48:08.534 --> 00:48:09.375]  They had rockets.
[00:48:09.375 --> 00:48:10.016]  They had everything.
[00:48:10.016 --> 00:48:11.137]  They had missiles.
[00:48:11.137 --> 00:48:13.640]  That's why Hitler didn't win World War II.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:14.341]  Came that close.
[00:48:15.967 --> 00:48:21.931]  They did all sorts of stuff, like they'd get there and the train had already picked up the atomic fissile material.
[00:48:21.931 --> 00:48:24.833]  And so they'd follow the train desperately and wait until it was loaded on a ship.
[00:48:24.833 --> 00:48:29.917]  Then they'd, you know, swim under the ship at night without even the gear and put a mine on it and sink it.
[00:48:29.917 --> 00:48:32.979]  I mean, just all sorts of stuff to stop Hitler from winning.
[00:48:34.437 --> 00:48:36.559]  And then you look at America today.
[00:48:36.559 --> 00:48:38.000]  We're trained to hate America.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.221]  America sucks.
[00:48:39.221 --> 00:48:42.723]  The president's bad for even saying the country exists.
[00:48:42.723 --> 00:48:44.845]  Nation states are bad.
[00:48:44.845 --> 00:48:49.128]  And so you wonder why Google and Apple moved to China.
[00:48:49.128 --> 00:48:53.031]  You wonder why they gave all the secret codes to them.
[00:48:53.031 --> 00:48:54.713]  You wonder why the Clintons gave them all of the
[00:48:56.201 --> 00:49:02.205]  ICBM technology so they could launch the missiles, deliver the missiles, deliver their payrolls.
[00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:03.646]  The MIRV technology.
[00:49:03.646 --> 00:49:13.212]  Howard Stern thought that was so funny yesterday when, you know, they basically had word for word things I had said about the Clintons selling out our MIRV technology.
[00:49:13.212 --> 00:49:21.517]  They were all, MIRV, it's a funny word, multiple re-entry device.
[00:49:21.517 --> 00:49:24.880]  So instead of one hydrogen bomb in a nose cone, you can have 20.
[00:49:28.806 --> 00:49:36.093]  It's so funny that we gave our archenemy something so one delivery system could vaporize 20 cities.
[00:49:36.093 --> 00:49:37.294]  Ha ha ha!
[00:49:37.294 --> 00:49:38.235]  Hey now!
[00:49:38.235 --> 00:49:38.796]  Hey now!
[00:49:38.796 --> 00:49:40.437]  I wonder how that'd feel.
[00:49:40.437 --> 00:49:42.679]  Again, this is the silliness of the public.
[00:49:43.453 --> 00:49:45.293]  No instinct to protect themselves.
[00:49:45.293 --> 00:49:47.094]  No instinct for territorialism.
[00:49:47.094 --> 00:49:48.594]  No instinct for anything.
[00:49:48.594 --> 00:50:04.797]  All that crazy Alex Jones is, you know, mad that Google and Apple moved to China and, you know, gave him all our secrets and he's upset that they've got their 5G coming in, spying on everything and, you know, that guy is just a crazy old man over there, you know.
[00:50:04.797 --> 00:50:07.098]  I guess I'm kind of crazy betting on America then, huh?
[00:50:09.568 --> 00:50:11.089]  Oh, everybody's out for everybody.
[00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.669]  No, they're not.
[00:50:11.669 --> 00:50:23.895]  The Chai comms would kill anybody in their population who did stuff like this in one second, because they're in it for themselves and their dirty Communist Party.
[00:50:23.895 --> 00:50:25.455]  And that's the thing.
[00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:33.059]  Trump is at least trying to stick up for us like we have any type of will.
[00:50:34.662 --> 00:50:50.989]  Instead, we act like a bunch of wimps, a bunch of chumps, a bunch of idiots, and then you see the culture of Hollywood, deliberately funded by foreign governments and others, putting out propaganda that is illegal.
[00:50:50.989 --> 00:50:54.931]  China doesn't let 95% of what we produce into their country.
[00:50:54.931 --> 00:50:57.092]  They call it demoralization.
[00:50:57.092 --> 00:50:58.372]  They call it cultural death.
[00:50:58.372 --> 00:51:00.413]  They know they're financing it.
[00:51:00.413 --> 00:51:01.794]  I'm gonna tell you again.
[00:51:04.841 --> 00:51:22.388]  We had a representative at Sundance this year to go investigate, and they openly said, demoralization, panic, darkness, we want people depressed.
[00:51:24.957 --> 00:51:25.957]  Now think about that.
[00:51:25.957 --> 00:51:28.939]  And of course, they have a show about girls committing suicide, record suicide.
[00:51:28.939 --> 00:51:33.281]  They want your daughters to tie a string around their neck and kill themselves.
[00:51:33.281 --> 00:51:35.262]  They want to murder you.
[00:51:35.262 --> 00:51:38.864]  Hollywood wants to kill you, okay?
[00:51:38.864 --> 00:51:40.644]  They don't wanna sell you tickets.
[00:51:40.644 --> 00:51:42.225]  They want you to kill your baby.
[00:51:42.225 --> 00:51:43.786]  They want you to take a bunch of drugs.
[00:51:43.786 --> 00:51:45.567]  They want you to commit suicide.
[00:51:45.567 --> 00:51:46.847]  They want your soul.
[00:51:46.847 --> 00:51:51.089]  That's not hyperbole.
[00:51:51.089 --> 00:51:54.251]  20 years ago, when they offered me some movies, I thought it was cute.
[00:51:55.851 --> 00:52:00.675]  Ten years ago, you couldn't pay me any amount of money to be in movies now.
[00:52:00.675 --> 00:52:06.340]  Even though they quote say it's going to be a positive message, it's always going to get twisted, unless it's an independent documentary.
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.981]  You understand, it's religious.
[00:52:07.981 --> 00:52:14.166]  You don't just not care about Hollywood, you need to want to throw up.
[00:52:14.166 --> 00:52:17.509]  Hollywood is empty, soulless, beyond anything you can imagine.
[00:52:17.509 --> 00:52:22.594]  The people, you think as you go up the Hollywood chain, you finally find oxygen.
[00:52:22.594 --> 00:52:23.935]  No, no, no, it gets worse.
[00:52:26.311 --> 00:52:38.095]  And so all these people go there thinking they're going to find themselves and all they find is emptiness and they commit suicide.
[00:52:38.095 --> 00:52:45.858]  Hollywood is venom out of a spider's fangs or out of a snake's fangs.
[00:52:45.858 --> 00:52:48.379]  It's doing what it's supposed to do.
[00:52:48.379 --> 00:52:49.879]  It's targeting you.
[00:52:49.879 --> 00:52:51.180]  It's targeting your children.
[00:52:52.048 --> 00:53:04.397]  More than half of it is financed by the most murderous government of bloodthirsty chi-coms the planet has ever seen in Red China.
[00:53:04.397 --> 00:53:07.499]  And I know you know this, but listen.
[00:53:07.499 --> 00:53:10.041]  Revel in your rejection of Hollywood.
[00:53:10.041 --> 00:53:11.241]  Revel in it.
[00:53:11.241 --> 00:53:13.323]  And teach your children that, and they will know.
[00:53:15.677 --> 00:53:16.638]  That's the enemy.
[00:53:16.638 --> 00:53:17.659]  That's the scum.
[00:53:17.659 --> 00:53:18.699]  That's the filth.
[00:53:18.699 --> 00:53:20.581]  That wants you to fail.
[00:53:20.581 --> 00:53:23.763]  Say no to it and reject it.
[00:53:23.763 --> 00:53:29.327]  And that's why all the comedians tell you how much you suck because you're white.
[00:53:29.327 --> 00:53:32.430]  Or how bad you are because you live in Arkansas.
[00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:34.672]  Or how much you suck because you live in Illinois.
[00:53:34.672 --> 00:53:36.833]  Or how bad you are because you're in upstate New York.
[00:53:36.833 --> 00:53:38.835]  Or how stupid you are because you're a farmer.
[00:53:40.444 --> 00:53:42.244]  Or how, what a loser you are.
[00:53:42.244 --> 00:53:43.605]  You're an auto mechanic.
[00:53:43.605 --> 00:53:48.385]  You're not some cool Hollywood meth head.
[00:53:48.385 --> 00:53:49.906]  All that matters is your soul.
[00:53:49.906 --> 00:53:51.446]  And I know you know that.
[00:53:51.446 --> 00:54:04.328]  And they're so pissed that they're losing control of us, and they want our kids so bad, and they want to destroy everybody so bad, and they want us all fighting with each other, and they try to say we're all racist, so we fight with each other.
[00:54:04.328 --> 00:54:07.089]  That's so evil.
[00:54:07.089 --> 00:54:09.489]  And then you realize they have no bottom.
[00:54:10.512 --> 00:54:20.279]  And they're doing it on purpose, and they're maneuvering us into this collapse to control us, and they're not going to get away with it.
[00:54:20.279 --> 00:54:22.921]  But of course they teach in schools, America sucks.
[00:54:22.921 --> 00:54:24.322]  Of course they're demoralizing you.
[00:54:24.322 --> 00:54:30.706]  Of course they want you to think you're pathetic and have no value, because they want to direct you and lead your life.
[00:54:30.706 --> 00:54:34.409]  You see the Facebook internal marketing, it's about keeping you desperate, keeping you scared.
[00:54:35.373 --> 00:54:45.200]  They've hired thousands of psychiatrists and top psychologists to mess with their algorithm to make you as pathetic and sad and alone as they can.
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.021]  You know what our marketing error is?
[00:54:47.021 --> 00:54:48.142]  We're in this together.
[00:54:48.142 --> 00:54:49.082]  We love you.
[00:54:49.082 --> 00:54:50.183]  We want to be empowered.
[00:54:50.183 --> 00:54:51.364]  We want you empowered.
[00:54:51.364 --> 00:54:52.965]  Let's win this together.
[00:54:52.965 --> 00:54:54.106]  There is no marketing.
[00:54:54.106 --> 00:54:58.148]  It's all just straight up truth.
[00:54:58.148 --> 00:55:04.833]  So you've got soulless Hollywood and soulless big tech thinking if they can eat us, if they can absorb us, they'll finally be a real boy.
[00:55:05.657 --> 00:55:06.617]  Well, guess what?
[00:55:06.617 --> 00:55:10.339]  Your system's dead on arrival.
[00:55:10.339 --> 00:55:11.999]  When we come back, I'm going to get to the Senator's speech.
[00:55:11.999 --> 00:55:12.779]  It's very powerful.
[00:55:12.779 --> 00:55:15.840]  I'm going to get to the antitrust systems that can break up the globalists.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:16.401]  Now we can do it.
[00:55:16.401 --> 00:55:18.061]  I'm going to get to it all next hour.
[00:55:18.061 --> 00:55:19.882]  Briefly, because this hour is almost over.
[00:55:19.882 --> 00:55:22.843]  I always wait to the end here.
[00:55:22.843 --> 00:55:32.626]  Quite frankly, if folks don't support us, it's like not locking your door at night or not brushing your teeth or
[00:55:33.993 --> 00:55:35.034]  Wiping your ass.
[00:55:35.034 --> 00:55:35.734]  Okay?
[00:55:35.734 --> 00:55:37.275]  And I appreciate everybody.
[00:55:37.275 --> 00:55:53.806]  And I'm not saying, hey, you better get in there and support us, but, ladies and gentlemen, our supporters, and our guests, and our crew, what this is, detonated the second American Revolution worldwide, and the enemy recognizes we are to be destroyed.
[00:55:53.806 --> 00:55:55.107]  But the enemy's getting weaker and weaker.
[00:55:56.408 --> 00:55:59.550]  But they can focus their firepower on who they see as the leaders.
[00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:05.575]  They believe if they take us down, they have a chance of winning, which is true in the short term.
[00:56:05.575 --> 00:56:07.396]  They're going to lose long term, no matter what.
[00:56:07.396 --> 00:56:09.417]  But I have a little bit of self-preservation in this.
[00:56:09.417 --> 00:56:10.858]  I'd like to sign that.
[00:56:10.858 --> 00:56:11.819]  I don't even worry about it.
[00:56:11.819 --> 00:56:15.242]  I just don't want to lose to these people, because they see me being destroyed as a victory, too.
[00:56:16.491 --> 00:56:18.933]  So, hold me up if you can.
[00:56:18.933 --> 00:56:20.074]  Thanks for putting up with me.
[00:56:20.074 --> 00:56:24.237]  I know I'm not perfect, but it takes a firebrand to kind of detonate this.
[00:56:24.237 --> 00:56:28.800]  And we're just a focal point, but we make it very easy at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:30.342]  We have Ultra 12.
[00:56:30.342 --> 00:56:31.402]  It's the new secret 12.
[00:56:31.402 --> 00:56:36.046]  It's twice as strong, the purest, highest quality out there.
[00:56:36.046 --> 00:56:39.288]  It's the best B12 you can get over the counter.
[00:56:39.288 --> 00:56:41.530]  And it is amazing.
[00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:43.272]  Put it under the tongue or put it in your water.
[00:56:43.272 --> 00:56:43.892]  It tastes sweet.
[00:56:43.892 --> 00:56:44.733]  There's no sweetener in it.
[00:56:45.652 --> 00:56:46.372]  Real B12.
[00:56:46.372 --> 00:56:47.953]  Tastes very sweet.
[00:56:47.953 --> 00:56:49.374]  There's no other flavor like it, though.
[00:56:49.374 --> 00:56:51.295]  You never taste a sweetness like this.
[00:56:51.295 --> 00:56:52.776]  It's 50% off out of the gate.
[00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:55.177]  It's very close to cost.
[00:56:55.177 --> 00:56:55.718]  $24.95.
[00:56:55.718 --> 00:56:59.580]  Crappy, synthetic stuff that doesn't even have as strong as more than this.
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:01.801]  This is a really great deal.
[00:57:01.801 --> 00:57:04.403]  So, if everybody just says on their calendar, hey, I want to sign up for AutoShip.
[00:57:04.403 --> 00:57:06.524]  You get an additional 10% off on your next order.
[00:57:06.524 --> 00:57:07.845]  Cancel any time.
[00:57:07.845 --> 00:57:09.606]  Sign up for a month, every two months, whatever.
[00:57:09.606 --> 00:57:11.667]  You just click the button when you want it sent to you.
[00:57:11.667 --> 00:57:13.548]  Go back in your profile, click any time, take it off.
[00:57:14.261 --> 00:57:22.091]  And you get your Ultra 12 at infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:24.013]  And we also have to end this special in the next few days.
[00:57:24.013 --> 00:57:27.898]  I told you, get a bottle of the amazing Good Halogen X2.
[00:57:27.898 --> 00:57:29.740]  Nobody else has this.
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:31.743]  For 25% off and get a free bottle of X3.
[00:57:32.944 --> 00:57:36.968]  We're getting right around to X2, so we've got to stop this sale very, very soon.
[00:57:36.968 --> 00:57:38.169]  Take the X2 Challenge.
[00:57:38.169 --> 00:57:39.250]  Experience it.
[00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:39.810]  See what it does.
[00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:41.272]  It takes about three weeks to kick in.
[00:57:41.272 --> 00:57:43.093]  It's elemental, literally.
[00:57:43.093 --> 00:57:44.675]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:57:44.675 --> 00:57:45.456]  Stay with us.
[00:57:45.456 --> 00:57:46.757]  Hour number two, straight away.
[00:57:49.161 --> 00:57:53.327]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:57:53.327 --> 00:57:54.408]  They are technocrats.
[00:57:54.408 --> 00:57:56.691]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:57:56.691 --> 00:58:03.580]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:58:04.121 --> 00:58:05.902]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:58:05.902 --> 00:58:08.384]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:58:08.384 --> 00:58:14.889]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:58:14.889 --> 00:58:20.073]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:58:20.073 --> 00:58:29.079]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlemen and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:36.026]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[00:58:36.026 --> 00:58:36.987]  It is amazing.
[00:58:36.987 --> 00:58:46.996]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.

[00:59:46.496 --> 00:59:52.838]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:52.838 --> 00:59:55.479]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.463 --> 01:00:13.588]  Alright, I've kind of gotten wound up and hyped up earlier, and I've got a ton of news I've got to get to, and a special guest joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:13.588 --> 01:00:16.890]  The 14-year-old who's taking the internet by storm that they're trying to ban right now.
[01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:23.554]  I want to get to the Senator's powerful speech when we come back, but here's Mark Dice knocking it out of the park, as usual.
[01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:36.375]  As you know, many schools have become safe spaces instead of actually teaching the kids history, math, and science, and instead provide them with an environment to invent new genders and find new things to be offended by.
[01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:49.504]  And now an Ohio high school has taken safe spaces to a whole new level, and will not be awarding students with the honor of valedictorian or salutatorian because it's going to hurt the other student's feelings because they didn't do as good.
[01:00:49.724 --> 01:00:52.768]  New at 11, first or second in class, no more.
[01:00:52.768 --> 01:00:59.817]  Mason City Schools is getting rid of valedictorian and salutatorian honors, honors that is, all to help students' mental health.
[01:00:59.817 --> 01:01:05.504]  900 Sides' Jake Ryle joins us live right now from Mason High School with reaction from parents and students.
[01:01:05.504 --> 01:01:06.185]  What are they saying, Jake?
[01:01:06.365 --> 01:01:07.606]  I'll take it from here, guys.
[01:01:07.606 --> 01:01:11.308]  This is something you would expect to see on a parody news website like The Onion.
[01:01:11.308 --> 01:01:15.370]  But if this is a real broadcast about a real school, then they're really doing this.
[01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:22.793]  What planet are we living on when a school has decided that giving the Valedictory and Salutatory Awards is going to hurt the feelings of the other students?
[01:01:22.793 --> 01:01:31.218]  The school's principal said, quote, this will help reduce the overall competitive culture at Mason High School to allow students to focus on
[01:01:31.578 --> 01:01:35.240]  Exploring learning opportunities that are of interest to them.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.501]  Reduce the competitive culture!
[01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:42.765]  Because we wouldn't want the kids to work hard and try to achieve something in their lives, now would we?
[01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:47.607]  Well, I guess it makes sense because if the Democrats get back into power, these kids won't even need jobs.
[01:01:47.607 --> 01:01:50.189]  They'll just live off of our tax dollars.
[01:01:50.189 --> 01:01:58.614]  Business Insider reports that the school is doing away with valedictorians to make mental health a priority, and experts think it's a game-changing policy
[01:01:58.894 --> 01:02:00.195]  What experts?
[01:02:00.195 --> 01:02:05.200]  I guess we're at the point where telling your kid to work hard and do good in school is bullying them.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:18.372]  Speaking of a kid who has been working hard, this is 14-year-old Sophia, who goes by the name of Soph on YouTube, who has over 800,000 subscribers, and she rails against political correctness and the social justice warriors.
[01:02:18.692 --> 01:02:22.814]  Remember when YouTube used to be about the little guy being able to reach a large audience?
[01:02:22.814 --> 01:02:24.654]  Well, that's not very caring.
[01:02:24.654 --> 01:02:28.556]  That's why we completely changed the algorithm, without telling you!
[01:02:28.556 --> 01:02:29.476]  Yay!
[01:02:29.476 --> 01:02:35.339]  Now the only way you can get on the trending tab is if you're already famous, rendering the whole thing ultimately pointless.
[01:02:35.339 --> 01:02:44.442]  BuzzFeed's feelings got hurt by her style of comedy, particularly after she posted this video making fun of Muslims, which, as you know, you're not allowed to do anymore.
[01:02:44.442 --> 01:02:48.284]  And so they're calling for her to be banned from YouTube.
[01:02:48.524 --> 01:02:53.930]  YouTube's newest far-right foul-mouthed, red-billing star is a 14-year-old girl.
[01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:57.073]  SnowFan has nearly a million followers on the giant video platform.
[01:02:57.073 --> 01:03:00.597]  The site's executives only have themselves to blame.
[01:03:00.597 --> 01:03:08.446]  And it looks like YouTube is getting ready to take her down because shortly after BuzzFeed's article, her channel received not one, but two strikes.
[01:03:08.906 --> 01:03:23.529]  One, according to her Twitter feed from a previous video in which it got a strike, then she appealed, then it was restored, now that video got a strike again, and then a different video of her pretending to be a communist making fun of commies also got struck.
[01:03:23.869 --> 01:03:25.770]  Now, she does have a very foul mouth.
[01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:29.612]  What teenager doesn't when they're away from their parents and trying to push people's buttons?
[01:03:29.612 --> 01:03:36.535]  But she is very talented, and I think that we should all stand up against this censorship and get her to a million subscribers today.
[01:03:36.535 --> 01:03:38.236]  The world has gone mad.
[01:03:38.236 --> 01:03:49.362]  So mad that Taylor University, a Christian university in Mike Pence's home state of Indiana, invited him to give the commencement speech, and so some of the students are upset about it.
[01:03:49.662 --> 01:03:58.015]  Students and alumni are outraged and shaking, of course they're shaking, after Vice President Pence invited to give the commencement address.
[01:03:58.015 --> 01:04:04.846]  Here's a little advice kids, if you're not a Christian and you don't like Christians, maybe you shouldn't go to a Christian university.
[01:04:05.146 --> 01:04:09.608]  Students at a Christian University are upset that Mike Pence is giving the commencement address.
[01:04:09.608 --> 01:04:10.489]  I mean, what's next?
[01:04:10.489 --> 01:04:15.051]  Is Sports Illustrated gonna feature a 300-pound beach whale in the swimsuit edition?
[01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:16.772]  Oh, wait, what's this?
[01:04:16.772 --> 01:04:18.033]  Oh, come on!
[01:04:18.033 --> 01:04:25.297]  This is not a joke, and I'm sorry that I have to keep saying that it's not a joke when it's not a joke, but I really want you guys to understand that they're really doing this.
[01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:33.223]  Listen, Sports Illustrated, if guys wanted to see a 300-pound woman wearing skin-tight clothes, they could go to Walmart any night of the week.
[01:04:33.223 --> 01:04:38.466]  You didn't have to put one in the swimsuit edition in the name of social justice.
[01:04:38.466 --> 01:04:46.492]  Okay, that's about all the liberalism I could take for a day, but be sure to subscribe to Soph's channel to get her to a million subscribers!
[01:04:46.492 --> 01:04:50.375]  And she's almost there, and she's joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:51.116]  But straight ahead...
[01:04:52.328 --> 01:04:55.610]  The Pentagon, Congress, the American people finally know Big Tech's the enemy.

[01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:17.210]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.932 --> 01:06:47.179]  If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any necessity of life.
[01:06:47.179 --> 01:06:50.960]  That is Senator John Sherman, Republican of Ohio,
[01:06:52.418 --> 01:07:06.907]  In 1890, with the Sherman Antitrust Act, the first of those acts, to not let the railroads and the big combines act and behave like God, and engage in all sorts of cartel activity.
[01:07:06.907 --> 01:07:19.635]  Because it's not just monopolies over certain things, it's monopolies working together to combine into a cartel, and then you get Venezuela.
[01:07:21.559 --> 01:07:25.261]  That's what this is all about.
[01:07:25.261 --> 01:07:36.428]  And I was quoting from the big New York Times article of May 8th last week, it's time to break up Facebook, from the co-founder, Chris Hughes.
[01:07:36.428 --> 01:07:44.112]  Now he says government has to get involved, and he gives some leftist, you know, drivel reasons, but there's some good points in here as well.
[01:07:44.112 --> 01:07:46.653]  I believe he wrote this article from a good place.
[01:07:49.548 --> 01:07:57.295]  But you've got all these Republicans, so-called libertarian think tanks, that since the 70s have convinced us you don't do anything to corporations.
[01:07:57.295 --> 01:08:10.167]  Well, when corporations are bigger than governments, and corporations control the communication systems and have monopolies, and then they start watching in real time and controlling what you're doing, that's authoritarianism.
[01:08:12.662 --> 01:08:19.225]  And they've got consent rulings against them, they've lost lawsuits, they're supposed to Facebook, Google, all of them were supposed to quit this a decade ago.
[01:08:19.225 --> 01:08:21.526]  They didn't quit, they got worse.
[01:08:21.526 --> 01:08:25.388]  And they've budgeted in the billion dollar, the five billion dollar fines they pay.
[01:08:25.388 --> 01:08:31.851]  That's nothing when you're making hundreds of billions of dollars a year.
[01:08:31.851 --> 01:08:34.072]  And so now, this is the key to everything.
[01:08:36.505 --> 01:08:54.488]  As a senator, in his first big Senate floor speech since he got in in November, Josh Hawley of the Show Me State, former prosecutor there, who I'm very impressed by, on his bill to not kill babies after they're born, Democrats voted it down, showed who they are.
[01:08:54.488 --> 01:09:03.030]  And his moves against Google years ago for antitrust, only state to go after Google.
[01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:04.550]  I mean, the guy's hitting on all cylinders.
[01:09:07.418 --> 01:09:18.143]  And he lays this out in larger papers and articles that the new aristocrats, the new royalty is Google, is Facebook, is Twitter.
[01:09:18.143 --> 01:09:19.724]  And what does royalty mean?
[01:09:19.724 --> 01:09:28.949]  It means you're above the law, it's arbitrary, you do whatever you want, and you can hand down power to whoever you want.
[01:09:28.949 --> 01:09:34.412]  You've got hereditary royalty, you've got hereditary dictatorships like North Korea, but you've also got
[01:09:35.336 --> 01:09:40.799]  Forms of royalty that are more like oligarchies, where it's clubs and groups, where the bureaucrats hand down power.
[01:09:40.799 --> 01:09:42.240]  Oh, we don't care Trump got elected.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.481]  We're bureaucrats.
[01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:45.541]  We'll have an insurance policy.
[01:09:45.541 --> 01:09:47.082]  We'll remove him from office.
[01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:50.284]  We are entitled to run America.
[01:09:50.284 --> 01:09:55.027]  You know, I was just in a Walmart, wrote Strock to Page.
[01:09:55.027 --> 01:09:58.989]  I could smell the Trump support.
[01:09:58.989 --> 01:10:02.050]  We're not going to let these people win.
[01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:02.791]  It's an arrogance.
[01:10:02.791 --> 01:10:02.991]  It's a
[01:10:05.117 --> 01:10:05.597]  Humorous.
[01:10:05.597 --> 01:10:07.078]  It's a royalty.
[01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:09.720]  How dare you!
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.222]  You're not going to do that!
[01:10:12.222 --> 01:10:16.084]  We're going to tell you what to do.
[01:10:16.084 --> 01:10:26.051]  And so he explains that the lie is the, not grassroots libertarianism that I like, that's constitutional, but
[01:10:27.441 --> 01:10:40.587]  The institutional system of laissez-faire, where these companies should do whatever they want, be tax exempt, be above the law, tell us what to do, oppress us, lie to Congress.
[01:10:40.587 --> 01:10:45.649]  They've had that position since big tech started 50 years ago, and it's all coming to an end.
[01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:49.991]  I'm not just saying that confidently, you can see it.
[01:10:49.991 --> 01:10:54.213]  And they're just arrogantly trying to just keep chugging along.
[01:10:54.213 --> 01:10:55.494]  And we've seen the major signs of this.
[01:10:56.877 --> 01:11:01.460]  Again, a year ago, head of Google said, I will not come.
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.721]  And we're not going to work with the Pentagon.
[01:11:02.721 --> 01:11:03.041]  F you.
[01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:03.401]  You're weak.
[01:11:03.401 --> 01:11:04.422]  You're stupid.
[01:11:04.422 --> 01:11:06.603]  Then they started to show their fangs a little bit.
[01:11:06.603 --> 01:11:10.045]  Congress started to stop acting like a bunch of idiots.
[01:11:10.045 --> 01:11:12.887]  And we're sorry Google came along.
[01:11:12.887 --> 01:11:16.209]  You see, stop acting like wimps, America.
[01:11:16.209 --> 01:11:18.230]  Stop being bullied by corporate media.
[01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:21.372]  So here's the senator's powerful speech on the floor just hours ago.
[01:11:21.372 --> 01:11:22.453]  Josh Hawley, here it is.
[01:11:23.683 --> 01:11:33.226]  General Bart, I commend your candor in calling what happened in 2016 what it is to spying the Trump campaign and spying on the President of the United States.
[01:11:33.226 --> 01:11:35.806]  Let's talk a little bit more about spying.
[01:11:35.806 --> 01:11:37.607]  Counterintelligence investigations.
[01:11:37.607 --> 01:11:38.307]  Fun thing about live TV.
[01:11:38.307 --> 01:11:38.767]  Shut it off.
[01:11:38.767 --> 01:11:41.088]  Just shut it off.
[01:11:41.088 --> 01:11:41.868]  I'm not mad.
[01:11:41.868 --> 01:11:42.568]  I love this.
[01:11:42.568 --> 01:11:43.648]  I think this is fun.
[01:11:43.648 --> 01:11:44.889]  I think this is cool.
[01:11:44.889 --> 01:11:45.749]  I think this is great.
[01:11:45.749 --> 01:11:48.750]  Because we have a big guest coming up live later on air.
[01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:52.331]  I'm going to try this again like I did before the show and like I did just now.
[01:11:53.712 --> 01:11:56.494]  Because I entered this time vortex today.
[01:11:56.494 --> 01:11:58.536]  I had a bunch of clips of the Senator.
[01:11:58.536 --> 01:12:04.160]  He was live two hours ago on the Senate floor with a speech he gave.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.721]  So we'll just produce on air now.
[01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:08.524]  But you do off air during breaks or before the show, which is great.
[01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:09.645]  It's fine.
[01:12:09.645 --> 01:12:18.351]  I just want to get a Roger Roger, which is the reason I'm just keep producing on air as long as it takes, that we do have the clip, right, of him on the Senate floor earlier.
[01:12:18.351 --> 01:12:22.595]  No response.
[01:12:23.388 --> 01:12:25.029]  Which is fine.
[01:12:25.029 --> 01:12:31.553]  Which is the only thing that frustrates me is in our response, so we... We're gonna have that for you later today, I promise you, okay?
[01:12:31.553 --> 01:12:33.894]  We're gonna have that for you.
[01:12:33.894 --> 01:12:35.735]  Not a clip from two weeks ago.
[01:12:35.735 --> 01:12:38.217]  So, and I'm not mad about it.
[01:12:38.217 --> 01:12:43.140]  To me, it's just the, you know, the not knowing, you know what I mean?
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:48.403]  And then it's just the, like, molasses, it just, it just pours out into the universe.
[01:12:49.537 --> 01:12:56.200]  And just kind of runs over the stairs and then just glides over the next thing and on to the next.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:02.103]  But here's the good part.
[01:13:02.103 --> 01:13:14.749]  America and the world is waking up to the fact that we have governments and we have systems that are acting and operating
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.921]  Like they're above the law of gods.
[01:13:19.921 --> 01:13:20.982]  And Americans are right.
[01:13:20.982 --> 01:13:26.024]  Government was getting too big in the 60s and 70s with too many regulations.
[01:13:26.024 --> 01:13:27.605]  And so, oh, let's leave companies alone.
[01:13:27.605 --> 01:13:31.387]  But that doesn't mean we set up companies like world governments.
[01:13:31.387 --> 01:13:37.670]  Because those very companies will lobby government to set up regulations to shut you down.
[01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:41.012]  Most of the big regulations being called for are by the big Fortune 100.
[01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:49.823]  Because they're using that to control everyone.
[01:13:49.823 --> 01:13:51.266]  They're using that
[01:13:53.134 --> 01:14:10.661]  To fix the markets, and man, you try to start a new website or a new social network, they got their SPLC and media groups harassing you, lying about you, scanning your servers to find out who hosts you, so they kick you off, and you get a note, sorry, you're a Nazi, you're off, and you're not a Nazi.
[01:14:10.661 --> 01:14:21.965]  It's all defamation, but it's big, powerful, trillion dollar companies that work with horrible authoritarian regimes, and they've gotten away with it forever.
[01:14:24.943 --> 01:14:29.086]  They've gotten away with it forever.
[01:14:29.086 --> 01:14:31.048]  And so now they think they can do anything.
[01:14:31.048 --> 01:14:32.289]  This isn't about free speech.
[01:14:32.289 --> 01:14:34.391]  That's just one part of it.
[01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:41.617]  This is about out-of-control groups that fundamentally don't like the free market system and don't even like the human community.
[01:14:41.617 --> 01:14:51.845]  And they're so in love with their tech and their screens and their data that they are divorced from humanity and believe that they need to transcend us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:54.462 --> 01:14:57.765]  And that's it.
[01:14:57.765 --> 01:15:00.427]  And that's what this has come down to.
[01:15:00.427 --> 01:15:22.344]  And I know you know that, but I could sit here with hundreds of articles that are interesting, that are informative, but I just keep harping on the big picture because the enemy wants us off the air because of that, because the decisions are being made right now about all of this.
[01:15:22.344 --> 01:15:22.924]  That's what's happening.
[01:15:24.452 --> 01:15:32.737]  And you cannot quantify how big a deal this is.
[01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:36.720]  You cannot underestimate the fact that this is central.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:48.287]  Because if you can't communicate with people, and if they can surveil everything you're doing and use it against you, and they're saying, families are bad and we're going to take your kids away from you and we're going to forcibly inoculate you, these are bad people.
[01:15:48.287 --> 01:15:49.307]  They believe you're weak.
[01:15:49.307 --> 01:15:50.428]  They believe you're over.
[01:15:50.428 --> 01:15:52.069]  They believe they're going to beat you.
[01:15:52.069 --> 01:15:52.750]  I believe you're not.
[01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:54.551]  I'm betting on myself.
[01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:55.171]  I'm betting on you.
[01:15:55.171 --> 01:15:57.372]  Stay with us.
[01:15:57.372 --> 01:16:01.394]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[01:16:01.394 --> 01:16:04.735]  Hey guys, it's Scott Bauer here, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.
[01:16:04.735 --> 01:16:06.616]  Are you looking for a super hot stock tip?
[01:16:06.616 --> 01:16:10.498]  Here at Prosper, we are always looking for exciting opportunities in the markets.
[01:16:10.498 --> 01:16:14.320]  And right now, all my students are salivating over this stock we are watching.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:20.463]  In fact, I've got this hot stock written down right here, and I'm about to text it to you for free.
[01:16:20.463 --> 01:16:21.784]  I just need to know where to send it.
[01:16:22.364 --> 01:16:28.307]  Simply text HOT to 48542 and I'll text it to you instantly.
[01:16:28.307 --> 01:16:30.228]  How do I know this stock is so hot?
[01:16:30.228 --> 01:16:39.693]  Well, I'm a former CBOE market maker for Amazon Options, former Vice President of Goldman Sachs, and I have over 25 years of professional trading experience.
[01:16:39.693 --> 01:16:41.694]  I'm telling you, this stock is hot.
[01:16:41.694 --> 01:16:45.415]  But be warned, the stock may move soon, so you need to claim it before it does.
[01:16:45.415 --> 01:16:46.116]  Text HOT.
[01:16:46.656 --> 01:16:49.177]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[01:16:49.177 --> 01:16:51.118]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[01:16:51.118 --> 01:16:52.919]  I had a problem like you once.
[01:17:05.766 --> 01:17:06.226]  I think?
[01:17:22.759 --> 01:17:23.359]  We're good to go.
[01:17:47.944 --> 01:17:48.424]  800-506-6740 That's 800-506-6740
[01:18:07.679 --> 01:18:16.682]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:18:16.682 --> 01:18:26.764]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:18:26.764 --> 01:18:35.307]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:18:36.127 --> 01:18:37.488]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:18:37.488 --> 01:18:38.629]  You must experience it.
[01:18:38.629 --> 01:18:45.635]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:18:45.635 --> 01:18:47.157]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:48.638]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:18:48.638 --> 01:18:55.324]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:18:55.324 --> 01:18:59.607]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.

[01:19:06.846 --> 01:19:09.127]  We had to end all those big discounts on the supplements.
[01:19:09.127 --> 01:19:15.129]  We're about to sell out of all of them, but we still have a big discount going, even though it's about to sell out on DNA Force, our flagship amazing product.

[01:19:55.114 --> 01:19:55.635]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.815 --> 01:20:04.426]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:43.482 --> 01:20:47.094]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here broadcasting live on this May 15, 2019 worldwide show.
[01:20:49.963 --> 01:20:56.347]  Coming up, we have the young lady that the corporate press, the assassins of truth have had a heart attack over.
[01:20:56.347 --> 01:21:03.891]  They want her off air and they want her off air now because she's gotten 800,000, a million subscribers in a few months.
[01:21:03.891 --> 01:21:09.734]  She's reached hundreds of millions of people and she's making fun of the left and you don't do that.
[01:21:09.734 --> 01:21:14.016]  Everything's a big safe space and you don't make fun of Islam when they kill people either.
[01:21:14.016 --> 01:21:14.637]  You accept it.
[01:21:15.217 --> 01:21:19.601]  And you submit to it, so she's coming up next segment.
[01:21:19.601 --> 01:21:23.504]  But now, let's go ahead and air a large excerpt of what I was telling you about earlier.
[01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:25.266]  And the article's up on Infowars.com.
[01:21:25.266 --> 01:21:28.329]  We'll post this speech to Infowars.com the next hour.
[01:21:28.329 --> 01:21:30.070]  Trumpism 2.0.
[01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:36.996]  Senator Josh Hawley unveils populist platform to fight big tech, aristocrats, and restore America.
[01:21:36.996 --> 01:21:37.357]  Here it is.
[01:21:42.145 --> 01:21:46.468]  Because to represent them will be a great responsibility indeed.
[01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:53.432]  I pledge to my fellow Missourians that I will work at this task with all the strength that God can give me.
[01:21:53.432 --> 01:21:58.496]  And I will serve without fear and without favor to any man.
[01:21:58.496 --> 01:22:01.578]  We Missourians are known for our frankness.
[01:22:01.578 --> 01:22:03.479]  And today I will be frank.
[01:22:03.479 --> 01:22:08.442]  Because this is a moment of great need for my state and for our nation.
[01:22:08.442 --> 01:22:11.084]  For this nation was born in a revolution by we the people.
[01:22:11.997 --> 01:22:20.684]  And premised on a revolutionary faith that it is the people, the common man and woman, who make democracy work.
[01:22:20.684 --> 01:22:25.888]  And it is the calling of every generation to renew that revolution for their day.
[01:22:25.888 --> 01:22:30.632]  But in our time, our revolutionary faith is faltering.
[01:22:30.632 --> 01:22:36.277]  And in the heartland of this country, the great challenge of our age is unfolding.
[01:22:36.277 --> 01:22:38.539]  I come from a town called Lexington, Missouri.
[01:22:39.557 --> 01:22:42.798]  It's a small place, but a proud one.
[01:22:42.798 --> 01:22:48.319]  It's a place where people wake early and work late to make a life for themselves and their children.
[01:22:48.319 --> 01:22:53.940]  It's a place where people value honesty and gumption and life's simple pleasures.
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:23:00.661]  Fine morning at a deer stand, reading to the kids before bed, Sunday dinner at mom's.
[01:23:00.661 --> 01:23:07.823]  And though it is humble, it's a place that reflects the dignity and quiet greatness of the working men and women.
[01:23:08.837 --> 01:23:14.699]  These are the people who explored a continent, who built the railroads, who opened the West.
[01:23:14.699 --> 01:23:22.942]  These are the workers whose labor launched the Industrial Revolution, and whose ingenuity made the American economy the marvel of the world.
[01:23:22.942 --> 01:23:30.164]  These are the families who have rallied to this country's flag in every hour of danger, and who bear the burden of defending our nation even now.
[01:23:31.027 --> 01:23:35.709]  These are the patriots who manned the fire department and coached the Little League.
[01:23:35.709 --> 01:23:47.894]  These are the generous who give $25 a month out of their gas money to assist people halfway around the globe they will never meet just because they believe in helping others.
[01:23:47.894 --> 01:23:52.135]  They don't ask for much, and they live by a simple creed.
[01:23:52.135 --> 01:23:56.357]  Give the best of yourself to your family, your community, and your fellow man.
[01:23:57.751 --> 01:24:04.514]  And America is a place of promise, because in these hearts, honor lives.
[01:24:04.514 --> 01:24:10.557]  But these working men and women are confronting crisis today, and as they do, so does our democracy.
[01:24:11.596 --> 01:24:20.818]  After years of sacrifice, the great American middle is being pushed aside by a new arrogant aristocracy.
[01:24:20.818 --> 01:24:33.640]  The new aristocrats seek to remake society in their own image, to engineer an economy that works for the elite but few else, to fashion a culture that is dominated by their own preferences.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:39.381]  When they think of helping their fellow citizens, they think of making everyone else more like themselves.
[01:24:40.592 --> 01:24:41.212]  And Washington?
[01:24:41.212 --> 01:24:44.774]  You know, Washington has just gone along.
[01:24:44.774 --> 01:24:55.058]  This town has embraced a politics of elite values and elite ambition, rather than building opportunities to thrive in the great and broad American middle.
[01:24:55.058 --> 01:25:08.143]  This has left middle America, the great American middle class, under siege, battling the loss of respect and work, the decline of home and family, an epidemic of loneliness and despair.
[01:25:09.272 --> 01:25:12.614]  This is the crisis of our time.
[01:25:12.614 --> 01:25:17.276]  I'm afraid you wouldn't know it to listen to the talk of this town much of the time.
[01:25:17.276 --> 01:25:27.022]  As the crisis deepens, the political establishment looks the other way, rehearsing and rehashing the political debates of 30 or 40 years ago.
[01:25:27.022 --> 01:25:29.823]  But there is no time for that any longer.
[01:25:29.823 --> 01:25:35.466]  The 21st century is upon us, and the great struggle of this century can no longer wait.
[01:25:35.466 --> 01:25:38.488]  The crisis that we face goes to the heart of our revolution.
[01:25:39.568 --> 01:25:47.602]  The United States is unique in history as a republic governed not by a select elite, but by the working man and woman.
[01:25:47.602 --> 01:25:52.510]  Because we believe it is through the working man and woman that God chooses to change the world.
[01:25:53.396 --> 01:26:04.381]  And that change comes not through spectacular feats of daring or glory, but through everyday work and everyday sacrifice and everyday acts of courage and love.
[01:26:04.381 --> 01:26:13.565]  And so it has been the proud working people, our farmers and mechanics and teachers and tradesmen, who have defined the character of this country.
[01:26:13.565 --> 01:26:18.948]  But for too long now, neither our economy nor our culture has lent them much support.
[01:26:20.034 --> 01:26:27.871]  Instead, our policy makers have entrenched the new elites and undermined the way of life that once bound this country together.
[01:26:27.871 --> 01:26:28.953]  It's time to face the facts.
[01:26:30.123 --> 01:26:37.168]  Over the last 40 years, our economy has worked best for those at the top, the wealthy, the well-educated.
[01:26:37.168 --> 01:26:43.773]  If you have a job in Silicon Valley, or an expensive and prestigious degree, this economy has worked for you.
[01:26:43.773 --> 01:26:48.297]  And Washington has focused on how to get more people to join this elite.
[01:26:48.297 --> 01:26:58.445]  But if you want a life built around the place where you grew up, if your ambition is not to start a tech business, but to join the family business, to serve in the PTA or in your local church,
[01:26:59.315 --> 01:27:04.438]  Well, you're told that you're not a success, and you're told that you're on your own.
[01:27:04.438 --> 01:27:06.360]  This is no accident.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:14.885]  The people who make the rules now, who run our large corporations, who set the tone for our popular culture, all belong to the same class.
[01:27:14.885 --> 01:27:17.067]  This economy has been their economy.
[01:27:17.067 --> 01:27:19.088]  They made it for themselves.
[01:27:19.088 --> 01:27:25.973]  But in places like the one where I grew up, in middle Missouri, good paying jobs that you can raise a family on,
[01:27:26.983 --> 01:27:28.663]  Are going away.
[01:27:28.663 --> 01:27:33.364]  The jobs go overseas or south of the border or to cities on the coast.
[01:27:33.364 --> 01:27:36.305]  And once vibrant towns, decline.
[01:27:36.305 --> 01:27:43.606]  Taking with them the network of schools and neighborhoods and churches that make up middle class life.
[01:27:43.606 --> 01:27:46.427]  Rural America has been particularly hard hit.
[01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:51.628]  Rural American's life expectancy has not just leveled off, it's actually dropped.
[01:27:51.628 --> 01:27:56.129]  And for women without a high school degree, that drop has been staggering.
[01:27:57.395 --> 01:28:02.079]  In some rural places, residents struggle with outright deprivation.
[01:28:02.079 --> 01:28:05.982]  My home state contains some of the poorest counties in America.
[01:28:05.982 --> 01:28:09.885]  All in rural places that once boasted thriving small towns.
[01:28:09.885 --> 01:28:12.348]  Alright folks, and we have an HD version of this.
[01:28:12.348 --> 01:28:13.529]  This is from the live stream.
[01:28:13.529 --> 01:28:17.752]  I'm going to post the full HD from his office up on Infowars.com.
[01:28:19.193 --> 01:28:22.116]  And when we put it in post, I'm going to air the whole thing.
[01:28:22.116 --> 01:28:37.068]  In fact, later in the broadcast, I'm going to air the rest of it because he lists the problems, but then he goes for the solution, which is a real Americana populist movement, anti-globalist that attacks the monopolies that have really set up our deindustrialization.
[01:28:37.068 --> 01:28:38.790]  So he goes even beyond Trump.
[01:28:40.299 --> 01:28:41.881]  And I'm 100% on board.
[01:28:41.881 --> 01:28:43.362]  This is exciting.
[01:28:43.362 --> 01:28:44.743]  And this is where we need to go.
[01:28:44.743 --> 01:28:46.705]  And he wants to break up Big Tech now.
[01:28:46.705 --> 01:28:49.267]  He's got a plan to do it within six months.
[01:28:49.267 --> 01:28:51.429]  And he's got the Presidents here.
[01:28:51.429 --> 01:28:52.050]  That's right, folks.
[01:28:52.050 --> 01:28:53.371]  The cavalry's coming.
[01:28:53.371 --> 01:28:53.991]  We're gonna win.
[01:28:53.991 --> 01:28:55.292]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:55.292 --> 01:28:55.693]  Stay with us.
[01:28:57.864 --> 01:29:02.947]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:02.947 --> 01:29:08.309]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the outleft sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:16.353]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[01:29:27.202 --> 01:29:31.064]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:50.211]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:58.254 --> 01:30:02.437]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[01:30:02.437 --> 01:30:03.498]  They are technocrats.
[01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:05.780]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:13.166]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:30:13.166 --> 01:30:15.027]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:30:15.027 --> 01:30:17.129]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:23.974]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:30:23.974 --> 01:30:29.158]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:30:29.158 --> 01:30:38.184]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:30:39.145 --> 01:30:45.127]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[01:30:45.127 --> 01:30:46.067]  It is amazing.

[01:31:00.347 --> 01:31:02.308]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:31:02.308 --> 01:31:03.109]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[01:31:03.109 --> 01:31:04.470]  You are the man, Alex.
[01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:05.991]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[01:31:05.991 --> 01:31:06.791]  I'm so excited.
[01:31:06.791 --> 01:31:07.692]  I'm such a big fan.
[01:31:07.692 --> 01:31:10.174]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[01:31:10.174 --> 01:31:12.675]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[01:31:12.675 --> 01:31:14.096]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:14.096 --> 01:31:15.537]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:15.537 --> 01:31:16.918]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:16.918 --> 01:31:18.199]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:18.199 --> 01:31:22.942]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[01:31:22.942 --> 01:31:24.343]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:31:24.343 --> 01:31:25.764]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:31:25.764 --> 01:31:26.925]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:31:28.005 --> 01:31:30.726]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:31:30.726 --> 01:31:34.906]  My daughter uses the Bubblegum Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[01:31:34.906 --> 01:31:38.707]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[01:31:38.707 --> 01:31:40.747]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[01:31:40.747 --> 01:31:43.308]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[01:31:43.308 --> 01:31:44.068]  I'm thanking you.
[01:31:44.068 --> 01:31:50.509]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[01:31:50.509 --> 01:31:51.229]  It is next level.
[01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.889]  It really is good.
[01:31:51.889 --> 01:31:52.450]  So thank you.
[01:31:52.450 --> 01:31:54.370]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:31:54.370 --> 01:31:54.750]  Thank you.
[01:32:04.124 --> 01:32:06.085]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[01:32:06.085 --> 01:32:08.566]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[01:32:08.566 --> 01:32:09.506]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[01:32:09.506 --> 01:32:09.967]  Yes, sir.
[01:32:09.967 --> 01:32:11.267]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:32:11.267 --> 01:32:13.368]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[01:32:13.368 --> 01:32:19.291]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sports shirts, all the equipment.
[01:32:19.291 --> 01:32:21.232]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[01:32:21.232 --> 01:32:22.212]  God bless you, brother.
[01:32:22.212 --> 01:32:28.495]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread
[01:32:28.575 --> 01:32:29.195]  I've never read that word.
[01:32:29.195 --> 01:32:30.316]  You're our only hope, brother.
[01:32:30.316 --> 01:32:32.617]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[01:32:32.617 --> 01:32:35.358]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:21.852]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:21.852 --> 01:33:23.072]  You've found it!
[01:33:23.072 --> 01:33:25.113]  The tip of the spear!
[01:33:25.113 --> 01:33:27.415]  It is The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:33.935 --> 01:33:50.761]  Well, I'm really glad that the crew and our lead producer Daria got this guest on.
[01:33:50.761 --> 01:33:52.022]  I had seen her work before.
[01:33:53.475 --> 01:33:55.217]  Very, very witty.
[01:33:55.217 --> 01:33:57.258]  Very, very smart.
[01:33:57.258 --> 01:34:01.021]  A little bit of foul-mouthness to it.
[01:34:01.021 --> 01:34:10.808]  For those of us that don't use a lot of foul language, just in regular repertoire of our verbal lexicon, you can try to look down on that.
[01:34:10.808 --> 01:34:13.329]  But I can certainly cuss like a sailor as well.
[01:34:13.329 --> 01:34:17.933]  But when you're talking to general audiences today, there's a reason that President Trump
[01:34:18.936 --> 01:34:19.216]  That's true.
[01:34:42.952 --> 01:34:44.112]  She's extremely witty.
[01:34:44.112 --> 01:34:49.513]  In fact, I've got a 14-year-old daughter that I could say is just as smart, but she's not really political.
[01:34:49.513 --> 01:34:50.814]  She just supports me.
[01:34:50.814 --> 01:34:52.034]  She knows I'm right.
[01:34:52.034 --> 01:34:53.194]  She's very well-informed.
[01:34:53.194 --> 01:34:55.395]  She just doesn't really care.
[01:34:55.395 --> 01:34:57.515]  Most of her friends are listeners.
[01:34:57.515 --> 01:35:00.696]  She's got friends all over town at other high schools.
[01:35:00.696 --> 01:35:09.938]  And I literally go to these girls' houses at pool parties and start to pick her up, and it's like 20 girls, and half of them are wearing Trump and InfoWars shirts.
[01:35:11.141 --> 01:35:13.163]  And that's not just in wealthy parts of town.
[01:35:13.163 --> 01:35:17.646]  I'll go out to some thing and party to pick her up at Dripping Springs at some birthday party.
[01:35:17.646 --> 01:35:20.348]  And, you know, it's blue-collar folks and they're all listeners.
[01:35:20.348 --> 01:35:22.730]  So, again, it's not just Alex Jones here.
[01:35:22.730 --> 01:35:26.213]  I'm not bragging, oh, I got a bunch of listeners and young people.
[01:35:26.213 --> 01:35:30.196]  It's the exciting news that Stephen Crowder's popular and Paul Watson.
[01:35:30.196 --> 01:35:37.862]  But what really scares them is somebody like this young lady coming along.
[01:35:37.862 --> 01:35:38.483]  S-O-P-H.
[01:35:40.493 --> 01:35:50.396]  Soph, formerly known as Lieutenant Corbus, is a 14-year-old YouTube personality that has been recently dogpiled for expressing right-wing views on her channel.
[01:35:50.396 --> 01:35:53.357]  Her channel's gotten close to a million subscribers and is growing.
[01:35:53.357 --> 01:36:06.940]  Her latest video, Be Not Afraid, where she criticized Islam and the modern left's censorship tactics that we're going to play after she leaves us, has been taken down for alleged hate speech, which is any nebulous term the left wants to invent.
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:09.481]  Along with a couple of her other videos, she's had two strikes.
[01:36:10.839 --> 01:36:12.620]  She's on the verge of being taken down.
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:19.263]  So you can have imams on there saying, your women are ours, Christ is a pig, we are taking over.
[01:36:19.263 --> 01:36:24.325]  You can have all that up there, but you can't criticize Islam.
[01:36:24.325 --> 01:36:26.086]  Here are the headlines, the breathless headlines.
[01:36:26.086 --> 01:36:32.509]  YouTube's newest far-right, foul-mouthed, red-pilling star is a 14-year-old girl.
[01:36:32.509 --> 01:36:33.690]  And then they blur her face out.
[01:36:34.966 --> 01:36:36.467]  Like she shouldn't be on air.
[01:36:36.467 --> 01:36:42.892]  Oh, but Desmond can be six years old when he first started dancing at gay bars and talking about taking ketamine.
[01:36:42.892 --> 01:36:50.078]  Little boys can have men put money in their g-strings, but little girls can't say they don't want to put a burka on.
[01:36:50.078 --> 01:36:50.918]  Potty mouth!
[01:36:50.918 --> 01:36:53.560]  Oh, suddenly the left is so concerned.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:54.341]  Potty mouth!
[01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:56.803]  Oh, look, a girl, we didn't abort.
[01:36:56.803 --> 01:36:58.744]  Oh, she's... Potty mouth, 14-year-old!
[01:37:05.839 --> 01:37:10.803]  Profane 14-year-old YouTuber spreads hate and far-right conspiracy theories.
[01:37:10.803 --> 01:37:11.864]  You mean questioning them.
[01:37:11.864 --> 01:37:15.467]  How social networks are recruiting teenage extremists.
[01:37:15.467 --> 01:37:17.508]  Oh my gosh, The Verge.
[01:37:17.508 --> 01:37:21.872]  BuzzFeed and the Outrage Mob hound this young lady.
[01:37:21.872 --> 01:37:23.253]  That's RT.
[01:37:23.253 --> 01:37:24.393]  So she joins us live.
[01:37:25.413 --> 01:37:36.207]  Unfiltered to talk with us, and so thank you very much for coming on, and tell us a little bit about yourself, the fact that they're trying to de-platform you, trying to un-person you.
[01:37:36.207 --> 01:37:39.632]  Wow, at 14, that's quite an accolade to have the Thought Police after you.
[01:37:40.543 --> 01:37:41.103]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:37:41.103 --> 01:37:42.324]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:37:42.324 --> 01:37:43.705]  I really love your program.
[01:37:43.705 --> 01:37:44.605]  I love what you do.
[01:37:44.605 --> 01:37:45.005]  It's awesome.
[01:37:45.005 --> 01:37:50.968]  And I'd like to say that you are indeed, in fact, like popular among Gen Z. Like they know who you are.
[01:37:50.968 --> 01:37:56.011]  You can say, you know, the quotes that have been memed and they'll know that it's Alex Jones.
[01:37:56.011 --> 01:37:58.732]  And I think it is really crazy that they're coming after me so hard.
[01:37:58.732 --> 01:38:05.095]  They're putting me in this box of far right, even though I'm not even, you know, grown up yet and I'm anti-political.
[01:38:05.095 --> 01:38:06.416]  And I think it's really crazy.
[01:38:06.416 --> 01:38:06.736]  I think
[01:38:07.396 --> 01:38:17.299]  Though it's a good sign that this is really throwing them for a loop and that it's a good defense against the thought police because you see, you know, a 14-year-old saying the things that I say and they don't know how to handle it.
[01:38:17.299 --> 01:38:33.064]  Like, you know, you write an article about her, it just makes her even more famous and it makes you seem like you're smearing a 14-year-old and it's really hard for them to come after me and I think it's a... And I would also like to thank BuzzFeed because I've gained like a hundred thousand subscribers over the past 24 hours because of them.
[01:38:33.064 --> 01:38:34.564]  So it really backfired on them.
[01:38:37.429 --> 01:38:39.610]  Well, you're right.
[01:38:39.610 --> 01:38:48.516]  I mean, it's backfired for now, but they, last time I heard, correct me if I'm wrong, you're the expert on this, tell us about the censorship.
[01:38:48.516 --> 01:38:52.658]  You've gone through the censored videos that have been taken down.
[01:38:52.658 --> 01:38:53.699]  There's two strikes, right?
[01:38:53.699 --> 01:38:55.740]  So you've got one more right now?
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:56.840]  Yeah.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.882]  So I don't even know how many strikes.
[01:38:59.882 --> 01:39:01.623]  It's kind of a convoluted system.
[01:39:01.623 --> 01:39:02.604]  Somehow they're like,
[01:39:03.484 --> 01:39:09.317]  Um, grouping in a lot of videos into one strike and they're getting me for hate speech and cyberbullying and harassment.
[01:39:09.904 --> 01:39:19.251]  And I think I'm one away from my channel being terminated which is scary but I don't think it's a reason to back down and I won't change my content because of it because YouTube is really a stepping stone.
[01:39:19.251 --> 01:39:35.604]  It's not something that's going to be around for much longer because people are just getting sick of being censored and I really hope that events like these are ones where controversial anti-PC YouTubers can sort of unionize and move over to or start a new platform.
[01:39:36.513 --> 01:39:37.473]  Well, that's right.
[01:39:37.473 --> 01:39:41.174]  As they squeeze, it just pushes people out and we're going to create new platforms.
[01:39:41.174 --> 01:39:42.995]  But in the time being, you've got to be careful.
[01:39:42.995 --> 01:39:44.675]  Your parents got to be careful.
[01:39:44.675 --> 01:39:46.236]  And obviously, you're running the show.
[01:39:46.236 --> 01:39:48.977]  You're very smart.
[01:39:48.977 --> 01:39:52.498]  Once they take you down, though, then they'll be able to lie about you.
[01:39:52.498 --> 01:40:00.960]  So I would create a backup channel through somebody else you work with where you also post your material so that you'll be able to have a voice and kind of leapfrog as long as you can.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:05.382]  Because once they take your scalp, you know, they kind of
[01:40:06.562 --> 01:40:09.663]  I guess like Gollum, they turn you into a slave of theirs.
[01:40:09.663 --> 01:40:11.743]  They create a straw man and steal your identity.
[01:40:11.743 --> 01:40:13.184]  So that's the next level of this.
[01:40:13.184 --> 01:40:16.685]  But I think, I mean, as you said, these strikes are fake.
[01:40:16.685 --> 01:40:18.465]  Some of the strikes have been pulled back.
[01:40:18.465 --> 01:40:26.347]  But they're in there, a bunch of bully SJWs piling on a 14-year-old young lady.
[01:40:26.347 --> 01:40:30.048]  And you don't look like you're even that physically big, but your brain is big.
[01:40:30.048 --> 01:40:33.549]  And I guess that's got to be very threatening for them, all ganging up on a girl.
[01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:43.613]  I mean, yeah, it's, um, I hope the, the strikes get, because there's just such a big audience on YouTube that it's good to, to grow an audience there.
[01:40:43.613 --> 01:40:51.736]  But I certainly find your, um, story inspiring because even after every major platform removed you, you're still going on your own website.
[01:40:51.736 --> 01:40:57.018]  And I think that's a step that a lot of us need to take if we want to survive and keep making our content.
[01:40:57.995 --> 01:40:58.675]  Wow, okay.
[01:40:58.675 --> 01:41:04.117]  Well, I mean, I've got three daughters, and they're awesome, and they're smart, but I'm impressed.
[01:41:04.117 --> 01:41:06.517]  Tell me something about your parents and something about yourself.
[01:41:06.517 --> 01:41:12.199]  I mean, don't get anything too private, but whatever's okay for you to get into, because I think America really admires you.
[01:41:12.199 --> 01:41:13.259]  Thanks.
[01:41:13.259 --> 01:41:16.700]  My parents are actually, they're actually, they voted Democrat.
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:18.161]  They voted for Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:18.161 --> 01:41:24.122]  They're left-leaning people, but they're fine with different opinions in the family.
[01:41:24.122 --> 01:41:24.922]  They think that's fine.
[01:41:24.922 --> 01:41:26.503]  They truly believe in free speech.
[01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:37.982]  Uh, they don't necessarily agree with me, but they don't want to shut me down either because they... And I think that's a stance that more left-leaning people should take, that they should be okay with, you know, ideological dissent.
[01:41:37.982 --> 01:41:43.749]  So your parents are more classical liberals who actually believe in freedom and their children being able to think for themselves?
[01:41:43.749 --> 01:41:43.909]  Yes.
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:49.464]  Well, there was a time in my life, 25 years ago, where I was almost a Democrat.
[01:41:49.464 --> 01:41:51.447]  Because the Republicans were being anti-free speech.
[01:41:51.447 --> 01:41:52.788]  Nothing like this.
[01:41:52.788 --> 01:41:55.231]  And those liberals back then were good people on average.
[01:41:55.231 --> 01:41:56.352]  They misguided some of them.
[01:41:56.352 --> 01:42:02.339]  But now it seems like... I mean, do your parents get freaked out by how piranha-like the left is attacking you and lying about you?
[01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:05.732]  I mean, yeah, they're certainly worried about that.
[01:42:05.732 --> 01:42:06.793]  They're nervous about that.
[01:42:06.793 --> 01:42:11.056]  I mean, just some of the journalists finding, you know, personal info, it's sort of scary.
[01:42:11.056 --> 01:42:12.738]  Like, is somebody going to show up at your house?
[01:42:12.738 --> 01:42:14.179]  Are you going to get swatted?
[01:42:14.179 --> 01:42:18.022]  You know, what are they willing to go through to take down somebody like me?
[01:42:18.022 --> 01:42:21.605]  Are you saying somebody's trying to dox you?
[01:42:22.717 --> 01:42:33.843]  I don't know if anybody's trying to dox me, but there's been journalists that have gotten my dad's number and started harassing him, calling him a Nazi and a skinhead and stuff like that.
[01:42:33.843 --> 01:42:36.424]  Really?
[01:42:36.424 --> 01:42:36.984]  Yeah.
[01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:40.106]  Wow, so your dad has been harassed?
[01:42:40.106 --> 01:42:41.807]  Yeah, he has been harassed.
[01:42:41.807 --> 01:42:42.567]  Wow, stay there.
[01:42:43.544 --> 01:42:44.967]  I know you took off school today for this.
[01:42:44.967 --> 01:42:46.410]  This is awesome.
[01:42:46.410 --> 01:42:49.395]  I am very excited about this young lady.
[01:42:49.395 --> 01:42:50.317]  Soph is our guest.
[01:42:50.317 --> 01:42:55.166]  You can follow her at SewerNugget on Twitter.
[01:42:55.166 --> 01:42:55.727]  I'll be right back.
[01:42:57.748 --> 01:42:59.409]  Defeat the globalists.
[01:42:59.409 --> 01:43:01.130]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:01.130 --> 01:43:02.631]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[01:43:02.631 --> 01:43:04.693]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:04.693 --> 01:43:09.596]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:09.596 --> 01:43:13.399]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:13.399 --> 01:43:21.445]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:22.385 --> 01:43:25.186]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[01:43:25.186 --> 01:43:32.448]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:43:32.448 --> 01:43:36.390]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:42.352]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:43:42.352 --> 01:43:46.873]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:46.873 --> 01:43:49.914]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment!
[01:43:57.727 --> 01:44:07.016]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:44:07.016 --> 01:44:09.899]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:44:09.899 --> 01:44:15.945]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:44:16.605 --> 01:44:22.869]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:44:22.869 --> 01:44:29.154]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:44:29.154 --> 01:44:36.078]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:44:37.219 --> 01:44:50.249]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:44:50.249 --> 01:44:54.512]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:44:54.512 --> 01:44:57.214]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[01:44:59.922 --> 01:45:00.803]  We got our speech!
[01:45:00.803 --> 01:45:06.047]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[01:45:06.047 --> 01:45:13.534]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[01:45:13.534 --> 01:45:14.855]  Are you coming back?
[01:45:14.855 --> 01:45:15.996]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[01:45:16.596 --> 01:45:17.817]  We're at newswars.com.
[01:45:17.817 --> 01:45:20.219]  Paul Watson's launched his own summit.news.
[01:45:20.219 --> 01:45:22.220]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:26.983]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[01:45:26.983 --> 01:45:29.245]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:45:29.245 --> 01:45:32.507]  InfoWars.com, man!
[01:45:32.507 --> 01:45:32.867]  Woo!
[01:45:35.578 --> 01:45:38.639]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[01:45:38.639 --> 01:45:40.180]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:42.901]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:45:42.901 --> 01:45:45.122]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[01:45:45.122 --> 01:45:48.623]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[01:45:48.623 --> 01:45:51.364]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[01:45:51.364 --> 01:45:53.625]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:45:53.625 --> 01:45:54.645]  That's where they find it.
[01:45:54.645 --> 01:45:56.606]  You know, there's things called websites.
[01:45:56.606 --> 01:45:57.026]  Just go there.
[01:45:59.022 --> 01:46:01.383]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:46:01.383 --> 01:46:08.006]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:46:08.006 --> 01:46:12.488]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[01:46:12.488 --> 01:46:18.471]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild anchovy fish oil,
[01:46:18.971 --> 01:46:25.457]  Ultra Purified Krill Oil and Wild Salmon Fish Oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[01:46:25.457 --> 01:46:37.447]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[01:46:37.447 --> 01:46:39.929]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 mg of high DHA omega-3s,
[01:46:42.751 --> 01:46:47.275]  This formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[01:46:47.275 --> 01:46:51.598]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[01:46:51.598 --> 01:47:01.386]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWars Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:47:01.386 --> 01:47:04.028]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:19.487]  Chauffeur Sophie has liberal parents.
[01:47:19.487 --> 01:47:21.689]  I don't even know what she calls herself.
[01:47:21.689 --> 01:47:23.030]  Right-wing libertarian?
[01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:25.452]  Well, there's a big national movement now.
[01:47:25.452 --> 01:47:26.873]  Hundreds of publications.
[01:47:26.873 --> 01:47:28.275]  They take her off air.
[01:47:30.532 --> 01:47:31.992]  These people are thugs.
[01:47:31.992 --> 01:47:32.452]  They're bullies.
[01:47:32.452 --> 01:47:33.573]  What they really hate is success.
[01:47:33.573 --> 01:47:37.793]  I want to play a few minutes of her latest band video.
[01:47:37.793 --> 01:47:39.094]  And of course, I was in it.
[01:47:39.094 --> 01:47:41.154]  I guess that's probably one of the reasons.
[01:47:41.154 --> 01:47:45.395]  Because, again, you're not allowed to show a clip of somebody that you support.
[01:47:45.395 --> 01:47:47.055]  Remember what Facebook said.
[01:47:47.055 --> 01:47:49.236]  You're only allowed to talk about me if it's negative.
[01:47:49.236 --> 01:47:52.956]  So we're going to have Sophie decry me after this video.
[01:47:52.956 --> 01:47:54.837]  Then maybe she can call me a name she wants.
[01:47:54.837 --> 01:47:56.337]  She can come to the studio and throw tomatoes at me.
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:47:58.460]  Alex Jones is horrible!
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:47:59.680]  He believes in freedom!
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:01.661]  But just add the proviso, he's a bad person.
[01:48:01.661 --> 01:48:06.002]  So here's the latest banned video that they say you don't have a right to see.
[01:48:06.002 --> 01:48:08.823]  As-salamu alaykum, my Muslim brothers and sisters.
[01:48:08.823 --> 01:48:13.083]  I come to you today to atone before Allah for my misdeeds against his people.
[01:48:13.083 --> 01:48:24.126]  I perpetrated grievous verbal abuse against the defenseless and entirely innocent people of Islam by very sincerely threatening nuclear genocide on the serious platform that is a Discord server.
[01:48:24.326 --> 01:48:28.428]  Little known fact, I was given permission by the United States government to do it.
[01:48:28.428 --> 01:48:33.491]  Not only did I have the codes, but the launch keys were in and the missiles were seconds away from being launched.
[01:48:33.491 --> 01:48:39.375]  All of a sudden though, I received a flood of Twitter mentions telling me that the actions I described were morally wrong.
[01:48:39.375 --> 01:48:41.256]  A fact which I was completely oblivious to.
[01:48:41.576 --> 01:48:51.042]  In their sage wisdom, they proved irrefutably that my hatred was unjustified, assuring me that there is no meaningful correlation between Islam and the proliferation of rape gangs in Europe.
[01:48:51.042 --> 01:48:58.826]  Long story short, peer pressure succeeded in completely changing my mind, and the peacemaking spirit of John McCain inspired me to stop the nukes just in time.
[01:48:58.826 --> 01:49:02.249]  Since then, I've become a devout follower of the prophet Mahmoud.
[01:49:02.249 --> 01:49:04.490]  Suffice to say, I've been having a f*** ton of fun.
[01:49:04.690 --> 01:49:12.559]  Of course, I get raped by my 40-year-old husband every so often, and I have to worship a black cube to indirectly please an ancient Canaanite god.
[01:49:12.559 --> 01:49:19.507]  But, at least I get to go to San Fran and stone the s**t out of some gays, and the cops can't do anything about it because California's a crypto-caliphate.
[01:49:19.667 --> 01:49:24.070]  The only part of Islam I absolutely cannot get into is the anti-Jew stuff.
[01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:28.252]  Personally, I just can't support any sort of animosity towards Jews.
[01:49:28.252 --> 01:49:30.293]  I wouldn't want to be a Nazi now, would I?
[01:49:30.293 --> 01:49:40.019]  I assume most of you have noticed the policies surrounding hateful conduct on social media platforms, virtually tightening a muzzle on the head of anyone whose speech eludes the narrative.
[01:49:40.179 --> 01:49:49.981]  They're purging their user base, using pseudo-offenses as an excuse to squeeze out ideological dissent and enforcing conformity into every internet community they can get their hands on.
[01:49:49.981 --> 01:50:04.865]  While the deplatforming can be partially chalked up to out-of-touch big tech CEOs who are just taking the path of least resistance, there certainly seems to be a coordinated effort coming from strident professional complainers who share an objective of removing reactionaries from all means of communication.
[01:50:04.865 --> 01:50:05.645]  Their job entails
[01:50:05.745 --> 01:50:06.545]  We're good to go.
[01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:37.785]  Because of that, it's very obvious that their behavior has been shaped by years of being humiliated and socially rejected by women.
[01:50:37.785 --> 01:50:45.630]  I know that reading will elicit people to accuse me of armchair psychology, but ask yourself this, why do they always speak like insufferable women?
[01:50:45.630 --> 01:50:51.234]  You see, I've had enough run-ins with these amoebas that I understand how they operate, and they never confront you directly.
[01:50:51.494 --> 01:50:53.455]  Instead, they default to saying things like,
[01:51:21.254 --> 01:51:22.155]  Well, inadequate.
[01:51:22.155 --> 01:51:28.042]  For example, when they say something is not a good look, ask yourself, who does it look bad to?
[01:51:28.042 --> 01:51:34.150]  The purpose of that little phrase is to make you imagine that there's a group whose opinions you should care about, but don't fall for it.
[01:51:34.150 --> 01:51:39.757]  They're powerless little prions who spend all day on the computer, scouring the internet for people to harass.
[01:51:39.957 --> 01:51:43.919]  And there's a reason why they always defer to groups, which fits neatly into my theory.
[01:51:43.919 --> 01:51:52.184]  Men, in general, tend more towards antisocial behaviors than women, which is why they're not afraid of confrontation or expressing themselves in an unpopular fashion.
[01:51:52.184 --> 01:52:02.090]  These spiritual manlets, however, are feminine, so they defer to groupthink for everything, and their method of attacking you is saying, you're not popular in our group, therefore you should feel bad.
[01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:03.671]  However, this two-folds.
[01:52:04.131 --> 01:52:07.754]  Since, unlike the Stacys, they don't actually have a group they belong to.
[01:52:07.754 --> 01:52:11.757]  And on top of that, it'd still be meaningless, since the truth is anti-democratic.
[01:52:11.757 --> 01:52:15.359]  Popularity is utterly irrelevant to what's true and what isn't.
[01:52:15.359 --> 01:52:23.105]  So no matter how much cool guy web-slaying they conjure up and lob at you, there's still evolutionary dead ends who can't think their way out of a paper bag.
[01:52:23.105 --> 01:52:26.928]  The worst thing you can do when met with these miserable creatures is compromise.
[01:52:27.108 --> 01:52:36.035]  These people are vampires of fear and hysteria, so if you maintain your position and refuse to comply with their demands, they'll become increasingly upset as time goes on.
[01:52:36.035 --> 01:52:38.357]  Don't ever allow yourself to be silenced.
[01:52:38.357 --> 01:52:45.683]  These nobodies will never amount to anything more than sock accounts on Twitter with numbers in their handle, whose most powerful weapon is cancelling you.
[01:52:46.636 --> 01:52:48.258]  Millennials kind of buy into the system.
[01:52:48.258 --> 01:52:49.919]  Half of them say they're communists.
[01:52:49.919 --> 01:52:51.721]  I think they're gonna wake up and figure out they've been conned.
[01:52:51.721 --> 01:52:54.423]  But Generation Z is very libertarian.
[01:52:54.423 --> 01:53:02.771]  And the fact that they're, like, really watching sophisticated stuff, I think that's part of genetics, is that each generation rebels against the last generation.
[01:53:02.771 --> 01:53:04.673]  And the older generation always thinks it's bad.
[01:53:04.673 --> 01:53:08.837]  Sometimes you're a good generation, they shouldn't be rebelling, but they genetically do it in case you're bad.
[01:53:08.837 --> 01:53:11.139]  And I think that the rebellion of young people
[01:53:12.328 --> 01:53:14.269]  I guess the thought police is a very, very healthy thing.
[01:53:14.269 --> 01:53:20.093]  I mean, I'm just telling you, like, I literally go to, like, school sporting events and other things.
[01:53:20.093 --> 01:53:26.257]  I go to public schools with my kids and their friends, and it's like, they don't know what CNN is.
[01:53:26.257 --> 01:53:27.678]  They know what Logan Paul is.
[01:53:27.678 --> 01:53:28.659]  They know what Alex Jones is.
[01:53:29.949 --> 01:53:36.731]  And they know who Sophie is, and they don't know why a guy that looks like Humpty Dumpty named Brian Stelter says that they shouldn't be on air.
[01:53:36.731 --> 01:53:44.273]  And so you call them out in this video, and you also put out that clip of me on Logan Paul, calling out the censors, calling out how pathetic they are, and they want you off air.
[01:53:44.273 --> 01:53:46.794]  Even if they disagree with you, they shouldn't do that.
[01:53:46.794 --> 01:53:48.654]  They have no honor.
[01:53:48.654 --> 01:53:50.035]  They have nothing.
[01:53:50.035 --> 01:53:56.676]  And you see the Antifa videos where they're particularly single women out to attack them, and then the left defends that.
[01:53:56.676 --> 01:53:58.437]  Who do you think these people are, Sophie?
[01:54:00.081 --> 01:54:03.884]  Um, it's mainly, I mean, it's something that I pointed out in my video.
[01:54:03.884 --> 01:54:08.428]  It's usually these people are not very masculine people who are doing this.
[01:54:08.428 --> 01:54:15.173]  Um, maybe sometimes they're just women, but it's a lot of guys out there that are very like feminine and low testosterone.
[01:54:15.173 --> 01:54:20.857]  And, and, um, the way they make up for that is competing in a sort of female social hierarchy.
[01:54:20.857 --> 01:54:21.178]  And they,
[01:54:21.838 --> 01:54:27.281]  I mean, I've seen that myself when I'll be in a restaurant and like 10 leftists come over and go, we're gonna get you, we're gonna kill you.
[01:54:27.281 --> 01:54:29.222]  They'll boo and go, you're a loser, everyone hates you.
[01:54:29.222 --> 01:54:32.823]  And then they'll wait till I'm leaving to say they ran me out and have like a simulated
[01:54:51.772 --> 01:54:58.215]  A war victory and then lie and say I attacked them and that I was thrown out, even though they were thrown out.
[01:54:58.215 --> 01:55:02.697]  So they also lie a lot.
[01:55:02.697 --> 01:55:03.698]  Yeah.
[01:55:03.698 --> 01:55:16.163]  I think that's a really good example because that's, to your face, they're just playing a popularity contest and they pretend like they were fighting as if they fought like men or something when they didn't do that at all because they can't.
[01:55:19.073 --> 01:55:21.133]  Why do you think they're so particularly scared of you?
[01:55:21.133 --> 01:55:27.835]  I mean, they are just all over, hundreds of publications saying you must be taken off the air, you're an extremist, you're dangerous, you're recruiting young people.
[01:55:27.835 --> 01:55:30.275]  Do they know how ridiculous they sound?
[01:55:30.275 --> 01:55:31.616]  I know, right?
[01:55:31.616 --> 01:55:35.176]  I've said it many times, I'm a pretty libertarian person.
[01:55:35.176 --> 01:55:42.378]  I don't like a lot of the political denomination, you know, games that go on here and they're putting me in this box.
[01:55:42.378 --> 01:55:46.879]  And I think it's because it just demonstrates that Generation Z doesn't
[01:55:47.379 --> 01:55:47.659]  I don't
[01:56:02.312 --> 01:56:02.552]  I think so.
[01:56:20.856 --> 01:56:23.580]  If you're listening on AM and FM, tell people about the show.
[01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:27.225]  If you're watching on the internet at Infowars.com for its last show, get it out there.
[01:56:27.225 --> 01:56:28.907]  If you're re-uploading stuff, free to air.
[01:56:28.907 --> 01:56:32.612]  If you're watching on TV, just this is verboten info.
[01:56:32.612 --> 01:56:37.599]  A smart young lady who's a libertarian who the left wants to silence because she uses some cuss words.
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:41.981]  Ladies and gentlemen, that doesn't violate the FCC, because the FCC doesn't run the internet.
[01:56:41.981 --> 01:56:46.923]  But again, the left wants to sexualize kids and have six-year-olds at gay bars dancing half-naked.
[01:56:46.923 --> 01:56:51.084]  But if a little girl says, F liberals, well, that she's a potty mouth, she's going to be taken off air.
[01:56:51.084 --> 01:56:52.064]  That's all coming up.
[01:56:52.064 --> 01:56:53.065]  Briefly.
[01:56:53.065 --> 01:56:53.365]  Briefly.
[01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.429]  Let's go!
[01:57:13.789 --> 01:57:14.929]  It's been wildly successful.
[01:57:14.929 --> 01:57:16.590]  We've never... I mean, even Secret 12.
[01:57:16.590 --> 01:57:17.790]  This is double the sales.
[01:57:17.790 --> 01:57:18.710]  We've never had a Secret 12.
[01:57:18.710 --> 01:57:20.891]  People get how good a deal this is.
[01:57:20.891 --> 01:57:22.751]  And so I thought we'd have a 3-4 month supply.
[01:57:22.751 --> 01:57:27.352]  We're gonna have to pull this sale in about a week or so because there'll still be months till we get more in.
[01:57:27.352 --> 01:57:29.713]  And it is just selling so fast at 50% off.
[01:57:29.713 --> 01:57:30.673]  It's such a good deal.
[01:57:30.673 --> 01:57:31.233]  So get in there.
[01:57:31.233 --> 01:57:32.354]  Get your Ultra 12.
[01:57:32.354 --> 01:57:33.434]  Sign up for AutoShip.
[01:57:33.434 --> 01:57:35.054]  An additional 10% off on your next order.
[01:57:35.054 --> 01:57:36.115]  Cancel for free.
[01:57:36.115 --> 01:57:36.535]  Anytime.
[01:57:36.535 --> 01:57:37.055]  Whatever you do.
[01:57:37.375 --> 01:57:38.216]  Take action.
[01:57:38.216 --> 01:57:39.077]  Get in the arena.
[01:57:39.077 --> 01:57:40.097]  Hit in the game.
[01:57:40.097 --> 01:57:42.099]  Fun dies and we won't back down.
[01:57:42.099 --> 01:57:42.860]  Stay with us.
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:43.941]  Hour number three.
[01:57:43.941 --> 01:57:44.882]  Only two minutes away.
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:55.385]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[01:57:55.385 --> 01:57:58.707]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[01:57:58.707 --> 01:58:00.328]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[01:58:00.328 --> 01:58:03.029]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[01:58:03.029 --> 01:58:04.490]  You're our only sponsors.
[01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:10.974]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[01:58:10.974 --> 01:58:12.896]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[01:58:13.456 --> 01:58:14.478]  I'm not the leader.
[01:58:14.478 --> 01:58:15.279]  You are the leader.
[01:58:15.279 --> 01:58:17.261]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[01:58:17.261 --> 01:58:22.669]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.

[01:58:41.297 --> 01:58:43.420]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:43.841]  God bless you.
[01:58:51.170 --> 01:59:00.573]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.

[01:59:51.322 --> 01:59:53.986]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:19.156 --> 02:00:22.919]  All right, joining us south, North Forest of Fiat.
[02:00:22.919 --> 02:00:25.241]  She is the demon child from the left.
[02:00:25.241 --> 02:00:27.844]  She's used the cuss words before.
[02:00:29.636 --> 02:00:33.600]  Oh my gosh, and they even blur her face out on BuzzFeed.
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:35.322]  And the National News has done it too.
[02:00:35.322 --> 02:00:37.985]  They said, the little exploited girl.
[02:00:37.985 --> 02:00:44.412]  Again, they have six-year-old kids for years up to age 11, dancing naked for men, having money put in their g-strings.
[02:00:44.412 --> 02:00:45.133]  That's good.
[02:00:45.133 --> 02:00:51.000]  With convicted murderers on television, talking about using ketamine and brohiminal and gang rape.
[02:00:52.148 --> 02:00:57.511]  They've got convicted child molesters doing story time on screen with their children all over the country.
[02:00:57.511 --> 02:01:02.093]  But this young girl, she's well-spoken and she doesn't like leftists.
[02:01:02.093 --> 02:01:05.134]  I'm going to read some of these articles when we come back.
[02:01:05.134 --> 02:01:07.236]  It's pretty sick unintentional comedy.
[02:01:07.236 --> 02:01:13.919]  So you realize they all started talking bad about her a few days ago and she's within one inch of me taking off YouTube.
[02:01:13.919 --> 02:01:15.520]  What a group of swine.
[02:01:16.658 --> 02:01:18.719]  I've been asking a lot of questions for this segment and the next.
[02:01:18.719 --> 02:01:21.601]  I want you to get into your world view, where you think this is going.
[02:01:21.601 --> 02:01:25.983]  You were talking about Generation Z and what you're seeing on the ground.
[02:01:25.983 --> 02:01:27.484]  I told you what I'm seeing in Austin.
[02:01:27.484 --> 02:01:33.707]  If you don't mind, what's the general area you live in and what are you seeing?
[02:01:33.707 --> 02:01:34.848]  I live in California.
[02:01:34.848 --> 02:01:38.890]  I used to live in New York.
[02:01:38.890 --> 02:01:40.651]  And you said you see Gen Z really waking up.
[02:01:40.651 --> 02:01:41.211]  What are you witnessing?
[02:01:42.673 --> 02:01:50.353]  Um, I see, I like to think of it as we're sort of the creation of the previous generation of ultra liberals.
[02:01:50.353 --> 02:01:51.395]  You know, kids are seeing
[02:01:52.139 --> 02:02:07.373]  Other kids like Desmond who are, you know, truly maybe being exploited and, you know, dancing at strip clubs and whatever and they're seeing, you know, over-the-top LGBT studies at school that are so bad that we can't even get into how much vulgarity that is in them.
[02:02:07.373 --> 02:02:16.222]  And kids see that and they're freaked out and they just, they wake up to it and they realize that some sort of narrative is being pushed on them and they rebel against it.
[02:02:18.809 --> 02:02:19.250]  Exactly.
[02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:25.382]  That's what I'm seeing is everywhere in the schools, public or private, they're saying Donald Trump's a KKK commander.
[02:02:25.382 --> 02:02:27.646]  People go find out the truth and then they never believe their teachers again.
[02:02:29.190 --> 02:02:29.931]  Yeah.
[02:02:29.931 --> 02:02:39.617]  I mean, I've been talking to this, uh, this kid and a couple other kids on Instagram and in their schools, if you say you like Donald Trump, you're, you get an in-school suspension for hate speech.
[02:02:39.617 --> 02:02:51.464]  You know, you say you're, you're, you lean this way politically instead of being far left, you, you get punished, you get detentions and, um, they get really angry about that and it just pushes them completely to the other side.
[02:02:54.702 --> 02:03:00.144]  Walk through more of that, because you see this in the news where people get thrown out of class for saying they support Trump.
[02:03:00.144 --> 02:03:02.264]  People get thrown out of school for wearing American flags.
[02:03:02.264 --> 02:03:06.906]  The Ninth Circuit ruled you can't wear American flags in, what, 12 states?
[02:03:06.906 --> 02:03:08.146]  That it's a symbol of hate?
[02:03:08.146 --> 02:03:10.587]  And that schools can say you can't wear them?
[02:03:10.587 --> 02:03:17.049]  I mean, how do we produce this many America haters?
[02:03:17.049 --> 02:03:17.749]  I don't know.
[02:03:17.749 --> 02:03:21.190]  I guess I don't actually know where all of the
[02:03:22.253 --> 02:03:26.577]  Ultra, like far left sort of thing stemmed from exactly.
[02:03:26.577 --> 02:03:33.484]  It is probably the result of a lot of factors and it may be a response to a conservative generation before that.
[02:03:33.484 --> 02:03:40.411]  You've talked about it, you know, generations rebelling against each other and it seems that the pendulum swing just keeps getting more and more extreme.
[02:03:41.499 --> 02:03:42.160]  Well, that's it.
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:45.162]  You have the CIA and the Ford Foundation wanting to screw up society.
[02:03:45.162 --> 02:03:46.343]  That's all declassified.
[02:03:46.343 --> 02:03:49.546]  So they created a hyper-leftist thing that's actually a ruling class.
[02:03:49.546 --> 02:03:50.266]  They weren't rebelling.
[02:03:50.266 --> 02:03:52.108]  They said, you're the ruling class.
[02:03:52.108 --> 02:03:54.890]  Now they've created anti-free speech mobs that are below them.
[02:03:54.890 --> 02:03:58.053]  So the baby boomers have created the...
[02:03:59.798 --> 02:04:04.841]  Generation X and then the Millennials below them that are pretty authoritarian on average.
[02:04:04.841 --> 02:04:10.764]  And then now you've just got an organic rebellion forming against being put in a cult, a leftist cult.
[02:04:10.764 --> 02:04:12.485]  So I think you hit the nail on the head.
[02:04:12.485 --> 02:04:14.727]  That's exactly what's happening here.
[02:04:14.727 --> 02:04:18.409]  Yeah, it's like it was.
[02:04:19.557 --> 02:04:20.778]  Some sort of thing.
[02:04:20.778 --> 02:04:21.179]  I don't know.
[02:04:21.179 --> 02:04:24.622]  Yeah, it goes back a lot in time.
[02:04:24.622 --> 02:04:32.050]  I know nowadays a lot of people are far left just as they're capitulating to the pressure, the pressure that I talked about in my video.
[02:04:32.050 --> 02:04:33.392]  They can't, you know,
[02:04:35.505 --> 02:04:45.130]  There's so much harassment that you get for not agreeing with the mainstream narrative that it's just too much for people in their normal lives to deal with.
[02:04:45.130 --> 02:04:46.451]  It just interferes too much.
[02:04:46.451 --> 02:04:49.933]  It just causes too many problems.
[02:04:49.933 --> 02:04:52.375]  All right, we're going to come back and get more into this with Soph.
[02:04:52.375 --> 02:04:56.657]  I'm Alex Jones, The Big Exclusive Interview.
[02:04:56.657 --> 02:05:02.921]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[02:06:08.399 --> 02:06:13.383]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:30.930 --> 02:06:33.572]  Well, we're really excited to have Soph joining us.
[02:06:33.572 --> 02:06:41.739]  He's at SewerNugget on Twitter, on YouTube at S-O-P-H, at Patreon.com forward slash Corbis.
[02:06:41.739 --> 02:06:46.023]  He's close to a million subscribers now, and he's exploding across the internet.
[02:06:47.938 --> 02:06:53.420]  Hundreds of millions of views on different derivative channels, and the system is getting mad.
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:07:00.583]  I want to spend time with her, but I want to read to you some of the things they're saying about her, because it's comical.
[02:07:00.583 --> 02:07:01.483]  The hand-wringing.
[02:07:01.483 --> 02:07:11.927]  You'd think, again, that some type of monster like Godzilla had come out of the ocean and was attacking, and it's breathless BuzzFeed, and Time Magazine, or Newsweek.
[02:07:14.431 --> 02:07:15.871]  Get her off the air!
[02:07:15.871 --> 02:07:17.071]  Oh gosh!
[02:07:17.071 --> 02:07:22.933]  And it just shows what authoritarians they are, but also how they have been built on these universities.
[02:07:22.933 --> 02:07:29.094]  They're now like a cancer busting out, and they just demand full conformity.
[02:07:29.094 --> 02:07:30.174]  But let's go over this.
[02:07:30.174 --> 02:07:32.334]  How did you get into YouTube?
[02:07:32.334 --> 02:07:33.775]  What made you want to get on air?
[02:07:33.775 --> 02:07:35.795]  How long have you been doing it?
[02:07:35.795 --> 02:07:38.115]  And you talk about YouTube being a stepping stone.
[02:07:38.115 --> 02:07:40.716]  What do you want to write now in your life?
[02:07:40.716 --> 02:07:41.656]  What are your aspirations?
[02:07:44.193 --> 02:07:49.656]  Sound funny, but I got into YouTube by watching gaming videos and mainly PewDiePie.
[02:07:49.656 --> 02:07:52.658]  This was all the way back in the fourth grade when I was nine years old.
[02:07:52.658 --> 02:08:02.623]  That's not even a joke, I was watching PewDiePie every day and I just, I figured I would, you know, give it a shot, do some Let's Plays of my own and I did that for a few years just for fun.
[02:08:02.623 --> 02:08:09.387]  And eventually I found the commentary genre on YouTube which was blowing up in 2016 and I thought that was, um,
[02:08:10.239 --> 02:08:19.876]  That was sort of a, I guess a prototype of what I'm doing now, where I would articulate some sort of idea for an audience, and back then it would be over a video game.
[02:08:19.876 --> 02:08:20.878]  That just sort of progressed.
[02:08:21.886 --> 02:08:29.932]  Over time after the commentary genre kind of died out, I grew as a person and I gained more knowledge.
[02:08:29.932 --> 02:08:40.360]  I sort of moved on to this and realized I would be a good person to fight against PC culture and thought police and I could do some pretty good comedy videos.
[02:08:41.713 --> 02:08:58.906]  About YouTube being a stepping stone, I think just nowadays with all the censorship and there's no transparency between YouTube and its creators and the community guidelines are constantly changing to, you know, please, please everybody who's putting pressure on them to be more PC.
[02:08:58.906 --> 02:09:08.253]  It's just, it's not a viable option for anybody who wants to make anything remotely nuanced, remotely interesting and controversial.
[02:09:09.048 --> 02:09:15.590]  So, yeah, I eventually maybe set up my own website, maybe move on to other platforms that are set up.
[02:09:15.590 --> 02:09:22.953]  I know BitChute is a good option and, you know... Well, my advice is be on as many platforms as you can.
[02:09:22.953 --> 02:09:23.733]  Go ahead.
[02:09:23.733 --> 02:09:30.935]  Yeah, so just, you know, widen my reach and try to be present and maybe do something like InfoWars.
[02:09:30.935 --> 02:09:35.216]  Yeah, set up your own website is probably the safest option.
[02:09:35.216 --> 02:09:36.557]  Well, let me raise this point to you.
[02:09:38.956 --> 02:09:41.537]  You need to fight back at what you're doing.
[02:09:41.537 --> 02:09:42.397]  You're very confident.
[02:09:42.397 --> 02:09:43.778]  You're very smart.
[02:09:43.778 --> 02:09:45.899]  You're very quick on your feet.
[02:09:45.899 --> 02:09:50.861]  And I'm not saying don't be confident, but I would also defend yourself.
[02:09:50.861 --> 02:09:55.723]  Because these outrage brigades, big tech works for the universities.
[02:09:55.723 --> 02:09:57.704]  They work to create this.
[02:09:57.704 --> 02:10:01.345]  They're feeding the trolls by empowering them to have people removed.
[02:10:01.345 --> 02:10:02.046]  That's all they're doing.
[02:10:02.046 --> 02:10:03.786]  So they need to be called out.
[02:10:03.786 --> 02:10:05.467]  But we go to Democrat Party events.
[02:10:05.467 --> 02:10:06.287]  My reporters do.
[02:10:06.287 --> 02:10:07.028]  I do every week.
[02:10:07.848 --> 02:10:08.709]  Five or six times.
[02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:13.191]  And I'm telling you, we're not cherry-picking people to just make them look like unhinged maniacs.
[02:10:13.191 --> 02:10:14.732]  I don't care if they're young or if they're old.
[02:10:14.732 --> 02:10:19.274]  You go to a Democratic event, they act like people at a state mental institution.
[02:10:19.274 --> 02:10:20.315]  They don't like free speech.
[02:10:20.315 --> 02:10:21.355]  They're violent.
[02:10:21.355 --> 02:10:22.716]  They're hateful.
[02:10:22.716 --> 02:10:23.536]  They scream.
[02:10:23.536 --> 02:10:24.217]  They yell.
[02:10:24.217 --> 02:10:25.457]  They are aggressive.
[02:10:25.457 --> 02:10:27.158]  They're bullies.
[02:10:27.158 --> 02:10:33.161]  And then I talk to you, I'm conservative or libertarian or just nationalist young people.
[02:10:33.161 --> 02:10:34.002]  They can be black or white.
[02:10:34.762 --> 02:10:35.803]  They're always smart.
[02:10:35.803 --> 02:10:36.784]  They're always talented.
[02:10:36.784 --> 02:10:38.245]  You don't have talking points.
[02:10:38.245 --> 02:10:39.266]  You sound like a smart adult.
[02:10:39.266 --> 02:10:42.128]  Most adults sound totally dumb now.
[02:10:42.128 --> 02:10:45.871]  And I'm just not sure what's happened in society, what's happened in culture.
[02:10:45.871 --> 02:10:47.953]  I don't know what you're experiencing out in California.
[02:10:47.953 --> 02:10:49.034]  It seems pretty bad out there.
[02:10:49.034 --> 02:10:51.276]  But what is it like?
[02:10:51.276 --> 02:10:51.936]  You're well-spoken.
[02:10:51.936 --> 02:10:53.697]  Your parents, I'm sure, are well-spoken.
[02:10:53.697 --> 02:10:56.460]  Have you noticed that a lot of adults can hardly talk?
[02:10:58.104 --> 02:10:58.824]  Uh, yeah.
[02:10:58.824 --> 02:11:06.486]  I mean, in my personal experience, I've seen a few teachers try to push a political message onto me.
[02:11:06.486 --> 02:11:11.987]  And, you know, when you question them further about it, they can't really defend their standpoint.
[02:11:11.987 --> 02:11:16.248]  And that's sort of disappointing.
[02:11:16.248 --> 02:11:19.288]  I don't get much interaction with adults outside of that.
[02:11:19.288 --> 02:11:21.429]  I know online watching series like
[02:11:21.949 --> 02:11:23.011]  You know, change my mind.
[02:11:23.011 --> 02:11:27.097]  It's just embarrassing how some of these adults act and carry themselves through the world.
[02:11:27.097 --> 02:11:29.200]  They take themselves so seriously, it's unbelievable.
[02:11:31.533 --> 02:11:40.959]  You know, something we need to do, we haven't done in a while, is we've got eight screen licks of people famously, you know, we shot that screaming, you're an effing white male, to a white male saying, you don't have speech, you're an effing white male.
[02:11:40.959 --> 02:11:49.284]  We've not made a compilation the last few years of all the unhinged leftists with their veins about to bust out, screaming, F you Nazi, you have no free speech.
[02:11:49.284 --> 02:11:53.447]  I mean, here's just a quick clip of just, well, there's like 20 minutes of this from just last week.
[02:11:53.447 --> 02:11:55.108]  Here it is.
[02:11:55.108 --> 02:11:56.549]  Get the hell out of here!
[02:11:56.549 --> 02:11:58.971]  Get these people the hell out of here right now!
[02:12:00.148 --> 02:12:03.050]  And they just run around foaming at the mouth.
[02:12:03.050 --> 02:12:04.751]  Alex Jones kills people.
[02:12:04.751 --> 02:12:05.591]  Who's he killed?
[02:12:05.591 --> 02:12:07.212]  People.
[02:12:07.212 --> 02:12:08.133]  Who?
[02:12:08.133 --> 02:12:08.853]  All of them.
[02:12:08.853 --> 02:12:09.693]  Names, please.
[02:12:09.693 --> 02:12:11.254]  The ones that he killed.
[02:12:11.254 --> 02:12:13.055]  We would really like to know the names.
[02:12:13.055 --> 02:12:14.396]  The Jewish people.
[02:12:14.396 --> 02:12:16.257]  Oh my gosh, come on.
[02:12:16.257 --> 02:12:17.118]  Give me the names.
[02:12:17.118 --> 02:12:17.698]  That's enough.
[02:12:17.698 --> 02:12:18.638]  And she's not editing this.
[02:12:18.638 --> 02:12:20.139]  It goes on for like 20 minutes.
[02:12:20.139 --> 02:12:22.200]  And then you think, well that doesn't... Then you go out in public.
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:25.282]  They're like... It's like Oprah Winfrey, The Secret.
[02:12:25.282 --> 02:12:27.644]  They believe because... Oh yeah, let's see H. Creeley for a second.
[02:12:27.644 --> 02:12:28.424]  We haven't seen him in a while.
[02:12:29.156 --> 02:12:34.620]  They, with audio in a second, they believe if they say it, you're a green frog, you're a green frog.
[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:43.525]  Here, let's play some H. Relics.
[02:12:43.525 --> 02:12:45.587]  There's Carl the Cuck.
[02:12:45.587 --> 02:12:46.187]  We gotta dump it.
[02:12:46.187 --> 02:12:47.228]  We've got an edited version.
[02:12:47.228 --> 02:12:48.288]  Somebody find it.
[02:12:48.288 --> 02:12:49.229]  Okay, let's go back to our guest.
[02:12:49.229 --> 02:12:51.550]  I'm ranting here.
[02:12:51.550 --> 02:12:53.912]  Sophie, where do you think this is going next?
[02:12:55.849 --> 02:12:57.932]  Um, I honestly have no idea.
[02:12:57.932 --> 02:13:06.403]  I think the sort of censorship is only going to get heavier and heavier as there's more conflict and tension between the two sides of the issue.
[02:13:06.403 --> 02:13:12.772]  And I think, I think you've talked about this before, they slowly just increase the oppression until
[02:13:13.220 --> 02:13:25.330]  You know, just at every step of the way, they just expecting people to, um, to accept that if they just add, you know, a little bit more censorship, a little bit more, okay, you can't say this, you can't say that.
[02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:31.875]  I think it's going to get to a tipping point where even people on the left are like, I can't handle this anymore.
[02:13:31.875 --> 02:13:42.183]  And I don't know what that's going to end up with, if that's going to be an actual war or if that's just going to be, you know, a lot of riots, but it's certainly going to end up in a lot of conflict the way I see it.
[02:13:42.998 --> 02:13:43.778]  No, you're right.
[02:13:43.778 --> 02:13:49.401]  And Silicon Valley and the universities and the left as a group are cloistered in their own weird bubbles.
[02:13:49.401 --> 02:13:53.682]  They think they're fighting old Republican bluebloods who are all dead.
[02:13:53.682 --> 02:13:55.443]  And the average conservative isn't even a conservative.
[02:13:55.443 --> 02:13:58.064]  They're just a common sense pro-America person.
[02:13:58.064 --> 02:14:02.946]  And the weird stereotype they're projecting on people isn't intimidating us anymore.
[02:14:02.946 --> 02:14:06.968]  So I think this is coming down very, very quickly.
[02:14:06.968 --> 02:14:08.228]  Yeah.
[02:14:08.228 --> 02:14:10.589]  It's not going to, it's definitely not going to end well.
[02:14:10.589 --> 02:14:12.370]  I think people are very pissed off.
[02:14:14.051 --> 02:14:20.677]  Mark Zuckerberg said you may not say Alex Jones or Infowars unless it's in a negative disparaging line.
[02:14:20.677 --> 02:14:31.207]  So Sophie, or Soph as you're known, S-O-P-H, evil YouTube star, would you like to decry me just to follow his orders and do what he says?
[02:14:32.423 --> 02:14:42.756]  Yes, Mark Zuckerberg, you're the best man alive, and Alex Jones is horrible, he stands for everything I hate, he's very despicable, and please keep banning him, keep him off the platform.
[02:14:42.756 --> 02:14:49.584]  But that's not exactly, the exact words were, you must decry me, what's the exact term?
[02:14:50.441 --> 02:14:51.941]  You must repudiate me.
[02:14:51.941 --> 02:14:54.002]  Just say it exactly as he says.
[02:14:54.002 --> 02:14:59.804]  It's not creepy when he's got 2.4 million people under his control that he's reading your messages in live time and saying what words you use.
[02:14:59.804 --> 02:15:01.204]  We submit to him.
[02:15:01.204 --> 02:15:07.426]  So you need to specifically say that you repudiate me.
[02:15:07.426 --> 02:15:09.947]  I repudiate Alex Jones.
[02:15:09.947 --> 02:15:11.307]  There we go.
[02:15:11.307 --> 02:15:14.028]  And you agree with AOC that the world is ending in 12 years?
[02:15:15.987 --> 02:15:17.028]  Yep.
[02:15:17.028 --> 02:15:20.490]  And if AOC gave you Kool-Aid with cyanide in it, you're gonna be good, right?
[02:15:20.490 --> 02:15:21.390]  Yep.
[02:15:21.390 --> 02:15:24.592]  You're gonna do what AOC says?
[02:15:24.592 --> 02:15:28.074]  I'll drink all the tap water that AOC wants me to drink.
[02:15:28.074 --> 02:15:29.515]  AOC.
[02:15:29.515 --> 02:15:30.995]  Think about AOC.
[02:15:30.995 --> 02:15:32.776]  You're knocking AOC because she's a woman.
[02:15:32.776 --> 02:15:34.978]  I'm knocking her because she looks like a meth-head demon!
[02:15:34.978 --> 02:15:38.360]  She's a damn moron!
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:39.780]  Got the crazy eyes.
[02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:41.962]  Oh, she's got some crazy eyes, man.
[02:15:42.893 --> 02:15:48.195]  She's, you know, let me tell you, if she ain't snortin' big ol' lines of methamphetamine every day, she's smokin' it.
[02:15:48.195 --> 02:15:55.338]  We'll be right back with the evil thought criminal, Ed Seward Nugget.
[02:15:55.338 --> 02:15:58.040]  Everyone knows, even good people fall on hard times.
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:01.441]  Your credit cards get maxed out, and you get behind on your taxes.
[02:16:01.441 --> 02:16:06.103]  Unfortunately, the IRS is not as understanding, and they won't stop until they collect.
[02:16:06.103 --> 02:16:10.765]  They have the power to take your paycheck, freeze your bank accounts, even your home or business could be at risk.
[02:16:10.965 --> 02:16:14.307]  It's simply not worth it to take on the IRS by yourself.
[02:16:14.307 --> 02:16:16.909]  You need to call the experts at Optima Tax Relief.
[02:16:16.909 --> 02:16:19.631]  When you call, be sure to ask about the Fresh Start Initiative.
[02:16:19.631 --> 02:16:26.095]  It's a special IRS debt assistance program that could save you thousands, even tens of thousands if you qualify.

[02:16:55.402 --> 02:16:56.622]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.622 --> 02:17:00.543]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.543 --> 02:17:02.083]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:02.083 --> 02:17:05.044]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:05.044 --> 02:17:10.605]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.605 --> 02:17:11.805]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.805 --> 02:17:14.745]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:14.745 --> 02:17:16.966]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:17:16.966 --> 02:17:21.406]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:17:21.406 --> 02:17:23.687]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:17:24.907 --> 02:17:31.249]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:31.249 --> 02:17:34.290]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:34.290 --> 02:17:40.212]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:40.212 --> 02:17:44.013]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:44.013 --> 02:17:45.273]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:45.273 --> 02:17:46.634]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.634 --> 02:17:52.815]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:52.815 --> 02:17:54.256]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:58.180 --> 02:18:00.041]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:18:00.041 --> 02:18:00.921]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[02:18:00.921 --> 02:18:02.262]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:18:02.262 --> 02:18:03.803]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:18:03.803 --> 02:18:04.603]  I'm so excited.
[02:18:04.603 --> 02:18:05.504]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:18:05.504 --> 02:18:07.985]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:18:07.985 --> 02:18:10.486]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[02:18:10.486 --> 02:18:11.907]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:11.907 --> 02:18:13.347]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:13.347 --> 02:18:14.748]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:14.748 --> 02:18:16.009]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:16.009 --> 02:18:20.751]  Tastes like, tastes like, uh, great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:18:20.751 --> 02:18:22.192]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:22.192 --> 02:18:23.472]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:23.472 --> 02:18:24.733]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:25.533 --> 02:18:26.694]  That's good!
[02:18:26.694 --> 02:18:26.914]  Whoa!
[02:18:26.914 --> 02:18:28.535]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:18:28.535 --> 02:18:32.737]  My daughter uses the Bubblegum Fluoride 3 toothpaste.
[02:18:32.737 --> 02:18:36.518]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[02:18:36.518 --> 02:18:38.559]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:18:38.559 --> 02:18:41.120]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products to get me some air.
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:41.881]  I'm thanking you.

[02:18:48.324 --> 02:18:49.064]  It is next level.
[02:18:49.064 --> 02:18:49.704]  It really is good.
[02:18:49.704 --> 02:18:50.265]  So thank you.
[02:18:50.265 --> 02:18:52.206]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:18:52.206 --> 02:18:52.566]  Thank you.

[02:19:58.877 --> 02:20:11.106]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:11.106 --> 02:20:17.031]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:20:17.031 --> 02:20:20.594]  Our guest is really interesting, S-O-P-H, Soph.
[02:20:23.323 --> 02:20:24.506]  East of Omaha.
[02:20:34.023 --> 02:20:36.405]  And she's just criticizing the left censorship.
[02:20:36.405 --> 02:20:39.167]  She's criticizing open borders, radical Islam.
[02:20:39.167 --> 02:20:41.109]  And they now have two strikes against her.
[02:20:41.109 --> 02:20:43.331]  They want to take her channel down.
[02:20:43.331 --> 02:20:43.751]  She's with us.
[02:20:43.751 --> 02:20:46.954]  I want to read some of this hysterical stuff they're saying about her.
[02:20:46.954 --> 02:20:50.697]  But you're very nice, you're very smart, but you're also very polite here on air.
[02:20:50.697 --> 02:20:51.818]  Other points you want to make.
[02:20:51.818 --> 02:20:53.539]  Other things you want to get into.
[02:20:53.539 --> 02:20:56.361]  What you want to do when you, you know, aspire to be when you grow up.
[02:20:56.361 --> 02:20:58.103]  I forgot to get into that.
[02:20:58.103 --> 02:20:59.444]  And just other points you'd like to make.
[02:21:01.011 --> 02:21:11.500]  Um, I would just like to say that, uh, I think it's a good point that if I were, um, super leftist right now, if I was spewing all of their talking points, they wouldn't call me brainwashed.
[02:21:11.500 --> 02:21:12.861]  They wouldn't call me exploited.
[02:21:12.861 --> 02:21:17.425]  And they would say, I know everything I'm saying, and it's not just an act of rebellion.
[02:21:17.425 --> 02:21:21.449]  They would just, they would call me woke and they would, um, they would be worshiping my feet.
[02:21:22.829 --> 02:21:25.351]  It's a really strange double standard that they have.
[02:21:25.351 --> 02:21:30.296]  You know, with people like Greta Thunberg, they never say that she's exploited, that she's brainwashed.
[02:21:30.296 --> 02:21:37.782]  With Desmond, they say that all the people calling CPS are being, you know, so paranoid.
[02:21:37.782 --> 02:21:43.367]  I just think it's so clear that the double standard that they have with that.
[02:21:43.367 --> 02:21:45.068]  Let's get more into the harassment.
[02:21:45.068 --> 02:21:46.109]  Tell us what happened to your dad.
[02:21:48.795 --> 02:21:55.160]  Well, this journalist named Talia Levin, she somehow got his phone number, his work email.
[02:21:55.160 --> 02:22:08.150]  She just started by asking if she could get an interview with him because I wasn't responding to her emails because I looked her name up when I saw her first email and I realized that she was looking to paint me as some far-right extremist.
[02:22:08.932 --> 02:22:13.175]  And, uh, when my dad didn't reply, she started, you know, like, trying to call him, text him.
[02:22:13.175 --> 02:22:18.338]  After a while, she said that he was enabling some sort of racist, Nazi behaviors in me.
[02:22:18.338 --> 02:22:21.060]  I mean, really just crazy stuff.
[02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:24.602]  That's real defamation when they're funded by an actual Nazi collaborator, George Soros.
[02:22:24.602 --> 02:22:30.886]  And that's one of the things they criticize you here, is you talk bad about the Lord and Savior, uh, George Soros.
[02:22:30.886 --> 02:22:33.068]  In fact, here's some BuzzFeed examples.
[02:22:33.068 --> 02:22:37.931]  YouTube's newest far-right foul-mouthed, red-pilling star is a 14-year-old girl.
[02:22:38.968 --> 02:22:41.889]  Then they blur your face like it's bad that your face can be seen.
[02:22:41.889 --> 02:22:49.093]  What does a 14-year-old girl dressed in a kudor have to say about YouTube to amass more than 800,000 followers?
[02:22:49.093 --> 02:22:50.134]  How about this?
[02:22:50.134 --> 02:22:51.614]  Nobody follows these people.
[02:22:51.614 --> 02:22:54.256]  I've become a devout follower of the Prophet Muhammad.
[02:22:54.256 --> 02:22:57.697]  Suffice to say, I've been having a lot of fun.
[02:22:57.697 --> 02:23:01.219]  Of course, I get raped by my 40-year-old husband every so often.
[02:23:01.219 --> 02:23:02.940]  I have to worship a black cube.
[02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:07.804]  To indirectly please an ancient Canaanite god.
[02:23:07.804 --> 02:23:18.556]  But at least I get to go to San Fran and stone the bleep out of some gays and then cops can't do anything about it because California is a crypto caliphate.
[02:23:18.556 --> 02:23:19.236]  Or how about this?
[02:23:20.017 --> 02:23:20.737]  And then it goes on.
[02:23:20.737 --> 02:23:41.967]  Yes, if you want a vision of the future of YouTube is midwifing, imagine a cherubic white girl mocking Islamic dress while lecturing her hundreds of thousands of followers about Muslim rape gangs, social justice homos, and that's all edited together, and the evils wrought by George Soros under the thin guise of edgy internet comedy.
[02:23:41.967 --> 02:23:43.968]  Oh, there's the guys!
[02:23:43.968 --> 02:23:46.569]  Oh, but they found the secret popular thing.
[02:23:46.569 --> 02:23:47.590]  It's always the same formula.
[02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:51.495]  We caught the secret that's all over and popular, and then they misrepresent it.
[02:23:51.495 --> 02:23:56.841]  And I want to warn you, and it sounds like you're smart beyond your years, but I still haven't figured this out.
[02:23:56.841 --> 02:24:01.467]  You talk to the New York Times, the Washington Post, anybody, you got to record it all.
[02:24:01.467 --> 02:24:02.549]  States still don't care.
[02:24:02.549 --> 02:24:04.151]  They will lie about you.
[02:24:05.430 --> 02:24:06.832]  At criminal levels.
[02:24:06.832 --> 02:24:13.258]  And so I've gotten to the point where I will not do any interviews because nothing good can come out of it, and what you're doing is very smart.
[02:24:13.258 --> 02:24:22.789]  If your dad talks to these people, or you do, they will say, you know, that she was eating feces in front of us, screaming, Heil Hitler, and her father was raping her with 14 baboons.
[02:24:22.789 --> 02:24:24.911]  I mean, they will say anything, so I'm warning you.
[02:24:26.058 --> 02:24:30.840]  Yeah, I mean with Joe Bernstein, I already got a taste of that.
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:41.304]  The email he started off with when he tried to talk to me and of course I didn't respond because he's well known to be a person that wants to smear everybody who doesn't agree with him.
[02:24:41.724 --> 02:24:42.905]  Yeah, you need to publish it all.
[02:24:42.905 --> 02:24:43.445]  People don't know.
[02:25:02.313 --> 02:25:04.417]  They have to lie, even if it helped.
[02:25:04.417 --> 02:25:06.360]  I'm telling you, total inversion.
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:09.105]  I'm glad you're experiencing it now, so you know how bad they are.
[02:25:09.105 --> 02:25:11.129]  Was it shocking to have them lie to your face?
[02:25:11.129 --> 02:25:12.331]  And then even have the email prove it?
[02:25:13.317 --> 02:25:14.477]  I mean, I was expecting it.
[02:25:14.477 --> 02:25:23.099]  That's why I didn't respond to the email because, you know, him trying to be all nice and, you know, try to predict what my move was.
[02:25:23.099 --> 02:25:25.019]  I was going to try to make fun of him or something.
[02:25:25.019 --> 02:25:32.161]  You know, being like that, I was like, there's no way that he actually, you know, wants to have an honest discussion with me because these people never want to have an honest discussion.
[02:25:32.161 --> 02:25:33.421]  So I didn't reply.
[02:25:33.421 --> 02:25:36.962]  And then when he made the article, I wasn't surprised because that's just what these journalists do.
[02:25:36.962 --> 02:25:37.902]  They have no principles.
[02:25:38.502 --> 02:25:41.486]  Well, here's the good news, and I'm not just saying this.
[02:25:41.486 --> 02:25:47.233]  Obama was hot when he was running, and for about a year when he was in, he would get millions of views on YouTube.
[02:25:47.233 --> 02:25:51.037]  He gets like, when he was still president, like 2,000 views on his average YouTube.
[02:25:51.037 --> 02:25:52.680]  Trump gets a million, I would get a million, whatever.
[02:25:53.863 --> 02:26:00.687]  So BuzzFeed, all these groups, it's turned out have fake clicks, they're all going bankrupt, salons going under.
[02:26:00.687 --> 02:26:07.791]  People understand, they literally have no readers except other fellow journalists that go around getting people censored.
[02:26:07.791 --> 02:26:15.675]  So they're not even journalists, they're a bunch of failed shell-outs of the system that don't understand, everyone hates them, and it's over.
[02:26:15.675 --> 02:26:16.415]  Yeah.
[02:26:16.415 --> 02:26:18.396]  I mean, you know, they just can't accept that
[02:26:19.758 --> 02:26:23.899]  These sort of news publications are becoming a thing of the past.
[02:26:23.899 --> 02:26:27.380]  The content is becoming, you know, it's going to a video format.
[02:26:27.380 --> 02:26:28.760]  It's going to online streaming.
[02:26:28.760 --> 02:26:30.201]  That's the new thing.
[02:26:30.201 --> 02:26:35.022]  And they're just sort of crawling to try not to die out.
[02:26:35.022 --> 02:26:40.063]  And so they make these crazy moves and crazy stories to desperately try to get clicks.
[02:26:40.063 --> 02:26:40.984]  And yeah, you're right.
[02:26:40.984 --> 02:26:45.805]  A lot of people that are reading these are people who are just like them, who are looking to smear people.
[02:26:46.545 --> 02:26:51.648]  They read Joe Bernstein's article, they go over to my channel, and they mass flag it, and they give me strike.
[02:26:51.648 --> 02:26:54.090]  So I think that's what's happening.
[02:26:54.090 --> 02:27:02.615]  Well, if you talk to, like, Charlie Worzel or any of these writers, you think they're putting on a retarded surfer act.
[02:27:02.615 --> 02:27:05.497]  Like, you think, okay, you're just acting dumb.
[02:27:05.497 --> 02:27:07.038]  They have low vocabularies.
[02:27:07.038 --> 02:27:08.399]  They're incredibly stupid.
[02:27:08.399 --> 02:27:10.400]  They're not intellectuals.
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:13.542]  You know, usually their parents have, you know, mental illnesses and things.
[02:27:13.542 --> 02:27:14.583]  I'm sad to say it.
[02:27:14.583 --> 02:27:15.644]  These are the bottom of the barrel.
[02:27:16.636 --> 02:27:21.418]  These are people that, you know, on a farm you'd have carry the bags of apples.
[02:27:21.418 --> 02:27:23.199]  You couldn't even have them go up in a tree and get apples.
[02:27:23.199 --> 02:27:25.500]  And I'm not being mean.
[02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:29.382]  But you have to understand, they are told they're the ruling class.
[02:27:29.382 --> 02:27:34.305]  They don't even get their villains out there killing free speech and openly trying to mainline tyranny.
[02:27:34.305 --> 02:27:37.907]  We'll push our next guest back 15 because you took school off today and I've got to have you on more.
[02:27:37.907 --> 02:27:44.250]  If you'll go on Owen today, this is a hot interview, people love you, and I'm very excited at what you're doing, my little sewer nugget.
[02:27:45.150 --> 02:27:52.559]  Again, it's S-O-P-H, like Sophie, but Soph, and patreon.com forward slash Corbis.
[02:27:52.559 --> 02:27:55.022]  People should really support what you're doing.
[02:27:55.022 --> 02:28:01.910]  Even if they don't like the edginess, this is how nationalists, conservatives, and patriots are going to win, is in a thousand different strikes.
[02:28:02.851 --> 02:28:05.013]  Some things deliver like a conservative preacher.
[02:28:05.013 --> 02:28:05.954]  That's who you are.
[02:28:05.954 --> 02:28:09.197]  Some things like a wild-eyed libertarian like I am.
[02:28:09.197 --> 02:28:11.779]  Some things like a snarky young lady like she is.
[02:28:11.779 --> 02:28:17.123]  But the quantity of quality information is light years ahead of the enemy.
[02:28:17.123 --> 02:28:18.524]  We don't have teleprompters.
[02:28:18.524 --> 02:28:19.806]  We're really talking.
[02:28:19.806 --> 02:28:22.188]  She's not being handed pieces of paper by her parents.
[02:28:22.188 --> 02:28:25.771]  She's up here having an adult discussion that most university professors
[02:28:26.974 --> 02:28:27.674]  Couldn't have.
[02:28:27.674 --> 02:28:32.256]  Like, they have a few talking points, and then, like, look to see if you have notes when you're talking to them about anything.
[02:28:32.256 --> 02:28:34.816]  Because they're frauds.
[02:28:34.816 --> 02:28:36.737]  And they know their time's over.
[02:28:36.737 --> 02:28:38.757]  And people like Soph are the future.
[02:28:38.757 --> 02:28:44.179]  So we're looking into the future in the final segment with our fellow thought criminals straight ahead.
[02:28:44.179 --> 02:28:45.359]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:28:45.359 --> 02:28:46.160]  Still here.
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:47.020]  Still fighting.
[02:28:47.020 --> 02:28:48.280]  InfoWars.com.
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:49.781]  PrisonPilot.com.
[02:28:49.781 --> 02:28:50.861]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:28:50.861 --> 02:28:54.062]  And we have two special guests coming up after her with huge breaking news.
[02:28:55.299 --> 02:28:59.841]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:59.841 --> 02:29:01.942]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:01.942 --> 02:29:03.663]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:03.663 --> 02:29:10.226]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:10.226 --> 02:29:15.308]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:15.308 --> 02:29:19.990]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:20.450 --> 02:29:23.552]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[02:29:23.552 --> 02:29:30.556]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[02:29:30.556 --> 02:29:35.759]  And if you have PPO private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[02:29:35.759 --> 02:29:39.041]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[02:29:39.041 --> 02:29:40.002]  Get clean.
[02:29:40.002 --> 02:29:41.823]  Call now and learn more.
[02:29:41.823 --> 02:29:41.863]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:45.845 --> 02:29:46.105]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:46.105 --> 02:29:46.426]  That's 800-506-6740.
[02:29:46.426 --> 02:29:49.430]  InfoWar, the most banned network in the world.
[02:30:02.273 --> 02:30:04.194]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[02:30:04.194 --> 02:30:06.696]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[02:30:06.696 --> 02:30:07.637]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[02:30:07.637 --> 02:30:08.097]  Yes, sir.
[02:30:08.097 --> 02:30:09.398]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:30:09.398 --> 02:30:11.480]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:15.122]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case.
[02:30:15.122 --> 02:30:17.424]  My truck, sport, the shirts, all the equipment.
[02:30:17.424 --> 02:30:19.365]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[02:30:19.365 --> 02:30:20.326]  God bless you, brother.
[02:30:20.326 --> 02:30:26.951]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[02:30:27.331 --> 02:30:28.431]  You're our only hope, brother.
[02:30:28.431 --> 02:30:30.752]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[02:30:30.752 --> 02:30:33.492]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[02:30:56.167 --> 02:31:07.955]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[02:31:07.955 --> 02:31:16.181]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with, and that it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[02:31:16.181 --> 02:31:20.444]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[02:31:21.304 --> 02:31:26.911]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there.
[02:31:26.911 --> 02:31:28.032]  Literally.
[02:31:28.032 --> 02:31:35.200]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known.
[02:31:36.021 --> 02:31:36.581]  Okay, it's true.
[02:31:36.581 --> 02:31:38.062]  I stayed up late last night, so...
[02:32:59.839 --> 02:33:07.789]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:07.789 --> 02:33:09.711]  He's going the distance!
[02:33:09.711 --> 02:33:10.752]  He's going for it!
[02:33:27.682 --> 02:33:31.244]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:31.244 --> 02:33:35.286]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:33:35.286 --> 02:33:40.149]  So, no exaggeration.
[02:33:40.149 --> 02:33:42.770]  How much was it?
[02:33:42.770 --> 02:33:46.572]  It was something like six million dollars, seven million dollars a year.
[02:33:46.572 --> 02:33:49.374]  We were bringing it off YouTube.
[02:33:49.374 --> 02:33:51.535]  And I was able to finance a bunch of the stuff we were doing here.
[02:33:51.535 --> 02:33:53.916]  I mean, it was one of our main funders.
[02:33:53.916 --> 02:33:55.277]  And about five years ago,
[02:33:56.621 --> 02:34:00.122]  They just demonetized 99% of our videos.
[02:34:00.122 --> 02:34:05.403]  I noticed we had a video bashing police, because I'll bash cops when they're bad.
[02:34:05.403 --> 02:34:15.366]  They would green light the video, let it get 20 million views, wouldn't shadow ban it, let all our subscribers see it, and we'd get paid.
[02:34:15.366 --> 02:34:20.647]  And they had, you know, YouTube vice presidents, and I had to sign non-disclosures and stuff, but, you know, call it up and
[02:34:22.087 --> 02:34:24.868]  I had agreements with them.
[02:34:24.868 --> 02:34:31.711]  It was all proprietary, so I can't get into all of it on air, but it was just stuff like, let us guide you and your message and you'll be a bigger star.
[02:34:31.711 --> 02:34:36.033]  I've got plaques in there, you know, where they send us awards and stuff.
[02:34:36.033 --> 02:34:42.476]  And I was like, wait, you want me to bash cops and then you'll turn the monetization on?
[02:34:42.476 --> 02:34:50.560]  So when we started to get more pro-police, I was never against police, but the media would cherry pick my negative comments and blow those up.
[02:34:51.357 --> 02:34:54.800]  Because they wanted that cultural division.
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:58.743]  When I started realizing that and pulled back, then they got upset.
[02:34:58.743 --> 02:35:02.606]  So there's a lot that goes into all of this.
[02:35:02.606 --> 02:35:07.970]  And you've got to be on the inside to learn about it all.
[02:35:07.970 --> 02:35:14.715]  Now understand, when you've got 80-something employees and bandwidth costs and things, $6 million sounds like a lot of money.
[02:35:14.715 --> 02:35:18.898]  How about when $6 million is gone?
[02:35:18.898 --> 02:35:19.639]  And am I complaining?
[02:35:20.652 --> 02:35:24.274]  I'm saying, think about how they didn't just take our sponsors.
[02:35:24.274 --> 02:35:25.715]  They don't just block us everywhere.
[02:35:25.715 --> 02:35:27.677]  They don't just take us off all these platforms.
[02:35:27.677 --> 02:35:29.858]  And then they'll tell you, you can't say our name.
[02:35:29.858 --> 02:35:35.662]  Then they make us pay for our own bandwidth, which is fine.
[02:35:35.662 --> 02:35:36.883]  We're doing it.
[02:35:36.883 --> 02:35:39.565]  Our own audio, our own video.
[02:35:39.565 --> 02:35:41.986]  And it's a good type of pain.
[02:35:41.986 --> 02:35:42.687]  We're going back to our guest.
[02:35:44.028 --> 02:35:50.553]  When usually our videos that we post maybe get 100,000 views in a week or so.
[02:35:50.553 --> 02:35:52.194]  Viral ones, sometimes a million.
[02:35:52.194 --> 02:35:54.615]  We've had a few that have gotten seven, eight, nine million apiece.
[02:35:54.615 --> 02:36:02.941]  And then I get the giant bill, you know, that's an extra $80,000 or whatever.
[02:36:02.941 --> 02:36:05.783]  But it's just people don't understand what goes into all of this.
[02:36:05.783 --> 02:36:10.607]  And then to just have people come in when you build a subscriber base and you put money into it with equipment and crew,
[02:36:11.820 --> 02:36:23.549]  Then you use YouTube with 5 billion views, and they already put ads on it and don't even give you the money, and then they completely throw you out and lie about you when they do it.
[02:36:23.549 --> 02:36:26.491]  That's really the biggest insult here.
[02:36:26.491 --> 02:36:37.579]  But the good news, and the reason Soph is so important at Twitter, at Surnugget, and on YouTube at S-O-P-H, is that even if they ban her, she'll go find another platform.
[02:36:37.579 --> 02:36:39.441]  And over time, it'll kill YouTube and Facebook.
[02:36:40.606 --> 02:36:43.432]  But other people will step into her shoes as well.
[02:36:43.432 --> 02:36:49.363]  So I just wanted to let her know that all the young people out there that are awake really excite me.
[02:36:49.363 --> 02:36:51.287]  Of the kids that are politically awake, I'd say 80% are.
[02:36:53.294 --> 02:36:58.598]  Contrarians, anti-establishment, they like Trump, but they really just like freedom of speech.
[02:36:58.598 --> 02:37:03.901]  Beyond that, they're very sophisticated, they're the opposite of a lot of the Millennials and the Boomers.
[02:37:03.901 --> 02:37:07.343]  I'm not saying all Millennials, all Boomers, I'm saying a large percentage statistically.
[02:37:07.343 --> 02:37:11.206]  Low IQs, lazy, stupid, ill, got a whole stack of news about that today.
[02:37:11.206 --> 02:37:12.767]  Something's wrong with them.
[02:37:12.767 --> 02:37:15.449]  And so I see Generation Z, who would have ever thought this,
[02:37:16.189 --> 02:37:27.718]  Because I have children, I have four children, and they're all Generation Z, you know, 16 down to two, and the three that are 11, 14, and 16, they're already past Alex Jones.
[02:37:27.718 --> 02:37:29.419]  They're already past Donald Trump.
[02:37:29.419 --> 02:37:32.182]  They're already past Austrian economics.
[02:37:32.182 --> 02:37:33.643]  They just get it.
[02:37:33.643 --> 02:37:37.466]  And that's got to really scare the establishment, or maybe so if they don't know what's happening.
[02:37:37.466 --> 02:37:37.906]  What do you think?
[02:37:37.906 --> 02:37:42.109]  Yeah, I think it's certainly scary that
[02:37:43.507 --> 02:37:47.809]  You have a whole generation that doesn't go along with their narrative.
[02:37:47.809 --> 02:37:51.971]  And I think that's also why all these news publications are freaking out, publishing all these stories.
[02:37:51.971 --> 02:37:54.153]  They realize that they're going to be gone soon.
[02:37:54.153 --> 02:37:59.916]  So they're trying to rake in all the profits before, you know, the next generation is the one that, you know, doesn't even watch them.
[02:37:59.916 --> 02:38:02.077]  I mean, no kid is on Facebook.
[02:38:02.077 --> 02:38:05.619]  No kid is watching CNN or Fox News or any of the mainstream stuff.
[02:38:05.619 --> 02:38:06.499]  They're all on Twitter.
[02:38:06.499 --> 02:38:07.800]  They're all on YouTube.
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:11.822]  You know, they're all getting their information from there, you know, 4chan, whatever.
[02:38:14.369 --> 02:38:18.672]  What happens then when they say Alex Jones is forbidden?
[02:38:18.672 --> 02:38:20.914]  I mean, in school or with your peers?
[02:38:20.914 --> 02:38:28.139]  What happens when there's a big national story, a thousand articles, Alex Jones is a Nazi, he's been banned?
[02:38:28.139 --> 02:38:30.501]  What do people say?
[02:38:30.501 --> 02:38:41.289]  I think that pushes them farther away from the establishment and that, you know, that spawns more memes, that makes more kids, you know, angry and it just, you know, pushes them more towards freedom of speech and it works.
[02:38:42.611 --> 02:38:47.093]  Maybe for the older generation, but it works in the opposite way for the younger generation.
[02:38:47.093 --> 02:39:03.540]  How can they be so historically blind that when you ban someone who's popular, you make them a folk hero, and they're doing it to more and more people, and it's backlashing, but they just giggle and laugh and celebrate like they're having a victory.
[02:39:03.540 --> 02:39:04.100]  It's bizarre.
[02:39:04.929 --> 02:39:09.613]  Yeah, I mean, it almost seems like it's intentional because of the Streisand effect.
[02:39:09.613 --> 02:39:12.415]  I mean, they should be very familiar with it by now.
[02:39:12.415 --> 02:39:19.521]  And just the amount of growth that I've experienced from having strikes and getting all these articles is insane.
[02:39:19.521 --> 02:39:29.010]  And I would think that they would be aware of that and make me think like there's something else going on, but I don't know how that would even work in their benefit.
[02:39:29.010 --> 02:39:30.411]  That's because you're logical.
[02:39:31.448 --> 02:39:36.988]  And that's because you obviously have a high IQ, but these people are illogical.
[02:39:36.988 --> 02:39:37.510]  Let me explain something.
[02:39:38.663 --> 02:39:41.124]  Their internal documents have come out, their internal WikiLeaks.
[02:39:41.124 --> 02:39:47.467]  I've experienced five years of being demonetized and then just more and more taken away until now.
[02:39:47.467 --> 02:39:50.888]  It's death threats, PIs, lawsuits, harassment.
[02:39:50.888 --> 02:40:04.534]  They really believe, sure, they believe up front destroying you in their eyes will give you a little bit of a supernova glow, but they think in the end they're going to dial it all back and exterminate you and take your bank account away.
[02:40:05.274 --> 02:40:07.756]  So that's why they're doing it.
[02:40:07.756 --> 02:40:12.480]  It's a very dangerous gamble, but they've seen it work in China.
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:15.883]  And so they think that it comes down to this stuff.
[02:40:15.883 --> 02:40:17.164]  I'm betting on you.
[02:40:17.164 --> 02:40:18.044]  You're betting on me.
[02:40:18.044 --> 02:40:19.545]  Your parents are betting on you.
[02:40:19.545 --> 02:40:20.506]  We're betting on America.
[02:40:20.506 --> 02:40:22.608]  I think this is going to blow up in their face.
[02:40:22.608 --> 02:40:24.610]  Matt Drudge thinks it's going to blow up in their face.
[02:40:24.610 --> 02:40:26.731]  Trump thinks it'll blow up in their face.
[02:40:26.731 --> 02:40:31.155]  I think it's up to us how active we are, how aggressive we are to see what happens.
[02:40:31.155 --> 02:40:32.416]  And I would encourage you and other young people
[02:40:33.823 --> 02:40:42.728]  It's great you're doing all this online, but go out, do some stuff in the third dimension, and then put that on the internet to encourage an invasion of the third dimension.
[02:40:42.728 --> 02:40:47.611]  Because more and more we're caught up in Silicon, zeros and ones, fantasy world.
[02:40:47.611 --> 02:40:52.013]  And that's fine, but I think an invasion of the third dimension needs to be led by people like you.
[02:40:53.032 --> 02:40:54.673]  Yeah, I definitely think that as well.
[02:40:54.673 --> 02:40:58.416]  And that's certainly going to be happening in 2020 with all the election stuff going on.
[02:40:58.416 --> 02:41:02.799]  I mean, that's a that's an amazing opportunity for all sorts of content.
[02:41:02.799 --> 02:41:07.622]  And my collaborator, who's a fellow Gen Zer, we write together.
[02:41:07.622 --> 02:41:08.382]  He lives in Brazil.
[02:41:08.382 --> 02:41:11.564]  He's coming over to the United States that year.
[02:41:11.564 --> 02:41:13.606]  He loves you as well.
[02:41:13.606 --> 02:41:15.407]  And we're going to be that's what we're going to be doing.
[02:41:15.407 --> 02:41:16.748]  We're going to be going outside.
[02:41:16.748 --> 02:41:22.752]  We're going to be on the street making that sort of content to encourage people to sort of, you know, be like us as well.
[02:41:24.493 --> 02:41:26.715]  So, I just feel like you're the cavalry.
[02:41:26.715 --> 02:41:28.056]  Can we queue up?
[02:41:28.056 --> 02:41:29.117]  You guys do a great job.
[02:41:29.117 --> 02:41:31.278]  I always give them stuff so fast they can't do it.
[02:41:31.278 --> 02:41:33.300]  We don't have a soundboard in there, but we should.
[02:41:33.300 --> 02:41:36.462]  A bugle of the cavalry call.
[02:41:36.462 --> 02:41:38.824]  Where the cavalry comes over the hill.
[02:41:38.824 --> 02:41:47.731]  Because, folks, I come on the air and I tell you, hey, I go to pick up one of my daughters at a birthday party, and it's like Elvis arrived.
[02:41:47.731 --> 02:41:48.532]  And they're all asking me,
[02:41:49.540 --> 02:41:50.981]  Do you know PewDiePie?
[02:41:50.981 --> 02:41:54.203]  Do you know Steven Crowder?
[02:41:54.203 --> 02:41:55.224]  Do you know Soap?
[02:41:55.224 --> 02:42:01.488]  I mean, this is what's happening, and they literally aren't saying, sorry, you got deplatformed.
[02:42:01.488 --> 02:42:03.750]  They're like, what is CNN?
[02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:08.373]  Literally, CNN has 100,000 viewers on average.
[02:42:08.373 --> 02:42:10.034]  Soap has that every hour.
[02:42:10.034 --> 02:42:15.237]  Think about the arrogance, though, of these people and where this is all going.
[02:42:15.237 --> 02:42:15.698]  It's incredible.
[02:42:20.353 --> 02:42:21.254]  Yes.
[02:42:21.254 --> 02:42:21.634]  Play it again.
[02:42:21.634 --> 02:42:22.514]  There she is.
[02:42:22.514 --> 02:42:24.175]  Can you do like you're riding in for us?
[02:42:24.175 --> 02:42:24.615]  Riding in?
[02:42:24.615 --> 02:42:32.240]  Salute you guys.
[02:42:32.240 --> 02:42:35.382]  So, so, I don't want you to miss any more school.
[02:42:35.382 --> 02:42:36.642]  Brainwashing or whatever.
[02:42:36.642 --> 02:42:37.603]  Tell your parents thanks.

[02:42:45.347 --> 02:42:46.908]  YouTube S-O-P-H.

[02:42:49.312 --> 02:42:52.097]  Thanks for having me.

[02:44:00.192 --> 02:44:08.754]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:44:08.754 --> 02:44:11.735]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:44:11.735 --> 02:44:13.476]  How can I solve that problem?

[02:44:55.976 --> 02:45:00.159]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:45:00.159 --> 02:45:01.220]  They are technocrats.
[02:45:01.220 --> 02:45:03.521]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[02:45:03.521 --> 02:45:10.407]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:45:10.967 --> 02:45:12.729]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:45:12.729 --> 02:45:15.211]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[02:45:15.211 --> 02:45:21.696]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:45:21.696 --> 02:45:26.901]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:45:26.901 --> 02:45:35.908]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[02:45:36.869 --> 02:45:42.855]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.

[02:46:52.470 --> 02:46:54.632]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:24.019 --> 02:47:28.901]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:47:28.901 --> 02:47:29.862]  From 11 a.m.
[02:47:29.862 --> 02:47:30.702]  to 3 p.m.
[02:47:30.702 --> 02:47:33.423]  Central we're here live.
[02:47:33.423 --> 02:47:39.866]  It just sounds crazy to say the most censored, the most demonized, the most lied about broadcast in the world.
[02:47:39.866 --> 02:47:45.569]  And we just had so fun this young lady that's got basically a million subscribers.
[02:47:45.569 --> 02:47:50.471]  Her videos have got hundreds of millions of views and the left wants her deplatformed and has almost done it.
[02:47:51.621 --> 02:47:53.942]  And she can confidently laugh at him all day.
[02:47:53.942 --> 02:47:54.862]  This is criminal.
[02:47:54.862 --> 02:47:56.422]  It needs to stop.
[02:47:56.422 --> 02:47:57.703]  But it just shows where they're going.
[02:47:57.703 --> 02:47:58.743]  But when I was in D.C.
[02:47:58.743 --> 02:48:02.064]  a few weeks ago, I'm not bragging about me.
[02:48:02.064 --> 02:48:08.086]  I kept getting mobbed by school tours of high schoolers and middle students.
[02:48:08.086 --> 02:48:15.728]  And finally, about, you know, into the 10th, mobbing, I said, hey, videotape this.
[02:48:15.728 --> 02:48:17.249]  And they're back there grabbing it.
[02:48:17.249 --> 02:48:19.069]  Dude did a video the other day.
[02:48:19.069 --> 02:48:21.370]  This is just one of the events that happened.
[02:48:22.537 --> 02:48:25.739]  The young people don't know what CNN is, literally.
[02:48:25.739 --> 02:48:27.580]  And that's where the system has miscalculated.
[02:48:27.580 --> 02:48:30.161]  They've already lost the hearts and minds.
[02:48:30.161 --> 02:48:40.226]  And yeah, they've kind of got that generation after that, and they've got the baby boomers who think they're the rightful rulers of America and the world, but they're not in full control.
[02:48:40.226 --> 02:48:42.688]  And so that's why they're cracking down on speech everywhere.
[02:48:42.688 --> 02:48:50.171]  Now, this is perfect timing, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:50.171 --> 02:48:50.892]  Absolutely
[02:48:53.220 --> 02:49:17.319]  Perfect timing right now because Trump and the White House and others are starting to move to understand what we're dealing with and if we win the free speech situation
[02:49:18.857 --> 02:49:20.638]  We win everything else.
[02:49:20.638 --> 02:49:26.500]  And you've had all these different Senators starting to figure it out.
[02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:33.023]  You've had the big speech given in the Senate today by the freshman Senator from Missouri.
[02:49:33.023 --> 02:49:35.524]  You've got the big article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:49:35.524 --> 02:49:38.165]  We're going to post this full speech there as we speak.
[02:49:38.165 --> 02:49:43.167]  In the article, Trumpism 2.0, Senator Josh Hawley
[02:49:45.399 --> 02:49:48.121]  Unveils populist platform to fight big tech.
[02:49:48.121 --> 02:49:49.862]  Aristocrats restore America.
[02:49:49.862 --> 02:49:50.843]  It's happening.
[02:49:50.843 --> 02:49:53.645]  The worm is starting to turn.
[02:49:53.645 --> 02:49:55.807]  That doesn't mean we're completely winning.
[02:49:55.807 --> 02:49:58.509]  But man, we've already come back a lot.
[02:49:58.509 --> 02:50:08.337]  We've already come back light years from where we were.
[02:50:08.337 --> 02:50:11.059]  So I wanted to get George on with us.
[02:50:13.038 --> 02:50:20.443]  And he's a documentary filmmaker, and I'd say more of a kind of a classical liberal, not a leftist.
[02:50:20.443 --> 02:50:26.527]  And they came here, I guess about eight months ago, then about four months ago, I'm not getting all the times right.
[02:50:26.527 --> 02:50:31.931]  And they said, we want to make really a fair film about the deplatforming and the censorship.
[02:50:31.931 --> 02:50:39.376]  And then basically right on time with the next wave of censorship, the film is coming out today.
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:51:02.498]  And so just imagine what it's going to be like if they're able to shut down everybody else's free speech.
[02:51:02.498 --> 02:51:05.801]  But that's what it comes down to.
[02:51:13.371 --> 02:51:17.233]  Imagine if this show just goes off the air.
[02:51:17.233 --> 02:51:22.095]  Imagine that.
[02:51:22.095 --> 02:51:33.541]  And I can sit here speechless at this point, and I'm going to play a few clips here before we go to our guest from the film, and we're going to go over all of it here today.
[02:51:33.541 --> 02:51:41.565]  But let's go ahead and play the clip of Gab McGinnis reveals his nightmare
[02:51:42.717 --> 02:51:59.553]  situation this is from the film that is going to be released in about an hour and eight minutes central time at you can't watch this dot com that is the main website and censored movie dot com as we can go directly and watch it
[02:52:00.888 --> 02:52:06.231]  And either watch it one time or you can buy the film and save it on your own device.
[02:52:06.231 --> 02:52:14.915]  And I would suggest you do that because this is a real fight for free speech and this is the only film, that would be a very good film as well, that even has the courage to cover this topic.
[02:52:14.915 --> 02:52:15.895]  Everybody else is scared.
[02:52:15.895 --> 02:52:18.176]  You either attack us or you're blackballed.
[02:52:18.176 --> 02:52:23.119]  So we'll talk to George about why he's done this and why he's had this courage in a moment, but here's that clip.
[02:52:26.946 --> 02:52:31.370]  So, two neighbors put up these signs that the leader of a hate group lives in our town.
[02:52:31.370 --> 02:52:32.090]  Oh no!
[02:52:32.090 --> 02:52:36.654]  So they put up the signs on my lawn that said, hate has no home here.
[02:52:36.654 --> 02:52:40.077]  Instead of talking to me, of course.
[02:52:40.077 --> 02:52:45.401]  And being known as a Nazi is the same as being known as a pedophile in today's society.
[02:52:45.401 --> 02:52:50.925]  If I heard there was a pedophile in my neighborhood, I would not put a sign saying, pedophiles have no home here.
[02:52:50.925 --> 02:52:53.187]  I'd knock on his door and go, so what's going on?
[02:52:53.187 --> 02:52:53.627]  What did you do?
[02:52:57.193 --> 02:53:00.597]  But I sent them all a letter.
[02:53:00.597 --> 02:53:10.148]  Not everyone, because some of them weren't about me, but I saw some even where they said, let's put the signs on his lawn and around his house and show him that hate has no home here.
[02:53:10.148 --> 02:53:12.911]  And again, we're talking about a very shrill minority.
[02:53:14.892 --> 02:53:20.194]  95% of the people in the burbs just want to raise their kids and not have any trouble.
[02:53:20.194 --> 02:53:29.497]  But there's 5% of these bored, rich housewives who have a nanny doing the loving and an au pair doing the driving and a maid doing the cleaning and the cooking.
[02:53:29.497 --> 02:53:33.878]  And the next thing you know, they've got these octopus arms, which I think all women have.
[02:53:34.913 --> 02:53:43.157]  They're brilliant at multitasking, and their octopus arms have no thing to do, so they just start being a busybody and meddling in your life.
[02:53:43.157 --> 02:53:47.679]  So, they do that, and then it just keeps getting worse.
[02:53:47.679 --> 02:54:00.326]  I mean, they vandalized my car, and they screamed obscenities at my house, and planned a vigil on my front lawn, and just ridiculous s***.
[02:54:00.326 --> 02:54:02.607]  And so I put out a letter saying, hey, reach out to me, I want to talk.
[02:54:03.393 --> 02:54:04.854]  You know, what I was saying earlier.
[02:54:04.854 --> 02:54:11.319]  So again, that's just some of what's in the film, a lot of action, a lot of other things, but it's humanizing the people that have been censored.
[02:54:11.319 --> 02:54:14.601]  It's showing what's really happening.
[02:54:14.601 --> 02:54:22.887]  And so I wanted to go to George Llewellyn, one of the directors and producers of the film, to get into what made you make the plunge?
[02:54:22.887 --> 02:54:26.970]  There's obviously a lot of intimidation, a lot of blackballing going on out there, and try to make a
[02:54:27.270 --> 02:54:29.431]  Classical, liberal, free speech film.
[02:54:29.431 --> 02:54:36.074]  And when did the left, in your view, basically abandon free speech?
[02:54:36.074 --> 02:54:39.055]  I think it happened a long time ago, to be honest.
[02:54:39.055 --> 02:54:43.436]  I spent a fair amount of time working with people like Tommy Robinson.
[02:54:43.436 --> 02:54:46.818]  I haven't always agreed with them.
[02:54:46.818 --> 02:54:48.819]  It's kind of a job that I fell into.
[02:54:48.819 --> 02:54:54.741]  I actually got my start interning at the BBC and kind of seeing how things would work there.
[02:54:55.350 --> 02:55:02.092]  That was a real wake-up call, and I think from there it's kind of just been a gradual progression, you know?
[02:55:02.092 --> 02:55:09.293]  A lot of the people in this movie I still don't agree with on a lot of issues, but what's happening to them is scary.
[02:55:09.293 --> 02:55:10.314]  It's scary for me.
[02:55:10.314 --> 02:55:17.596]  I've always, you know, been into controversial things, like more controversial topics.
[02:55:17.596 --> 02:55:23.437]  I think those are the interesting discussions that we're having as a society, and so for that
[02:55:24.246 --> 02:55:27.189]  To be taken away from people who are involved in that conversation.
[02:55:27.189 --> 02:55:30.753]  I think that's... It's a worrying, worrying trend.
[02:55:33.902 --> 02:55:40.525]  Well, I mean, I look at the censorship going on, and it's gotten cartoonish level, like they're trying to act like villains.
[02:55:40.525 --> 02:55:42.446]  And then, like, I had the young lady on who they're trying to censor.
[02:55:42.446 --> 02:55:43.767]  She goes, it's almost like it's on purpose.
[02:55:43.767 --> 02:55:44.827]  No, it's not.
[02:55:44.827 --> 02:55:46.288]  We've gotten the internal emails.
[02:55:46.288 --> 02:55:48.309]  I've been in lawsuits with these people.
[02:55:48.309 --> 02:55:51.831]  They want to silence anyone they want.
[02:55:51.831 --> 02:55:54.232]  And you look at universities, there's no free speech on those anymore.
[02:55:54.232 --> 02:55:56.193]  I mean, it's just, it's a total
[02:55:59.062 --> 02:56:02.044]  Abandonment of any Western values.
[02:56:02.044 --> 02:56:07.486]  And I guess that's why the left is so allied with radical Islam now.
[02:56:07.486 --> 02:56:09.087]  Yeah, I mean, this is the thing.
[02:56:09.087 --> 02:56:19.372]  You look at Facebook, and one of the co-founders of Facebook this week was literally talking about how Facebook should be broken up because it's become too powerful.
[02:56:19.372 --> 02:56:25.075]  And there is the kind of libertarian argument that these are private companies, they can do what they want.
[02:56:25.879 --> 02:56:36.923]  One of the things that this movie goes on to explore that I think is so important is not just whether they're platforms or publishers, but how much power do we want to afford a private company like Facebook?
[02:56:36.923 --> 02:56:40.364]  How much power do we want to afford a company like Twitter?
[02:56:40.364 --> 02:56:50.287]  Because they literally, by removing one person from the debate, they're removing a huge number of people's ability to hear those arguments, to hear that side of the story.
[02:56:50.791 --> 02:56:57.980]  I always believe that we sharpen our wit by debating and arguing with people else in public.
[02:56:57.980 --> 02:57:05.069]  I would rather my Nazi was not hidden away and banned off whatever platform it is, if you're going to go to that level.
[02:57:05.069 --> 02:57:09.214]  I would rather a Nazi was standing on a plinth in the middle of London
[02:57:09.642 --> 02:57:10.102]  I don't know.
[02:57:28.234 --> 02:57:34.338]  America, for example, was founded, and that's how it grew, it became... Exactly, it's the opposite of Western culture.
[02:57:34.338 --> 02:57:36.459]  Hold on, stay there, George.
[02:57:36.459 --> 02:57:37.560]  We're gonna be right back.
[02:57:37.560 --> 02:57:39.782]  Again, it's May 5th, 2019.
[02:57:39.782 --> 02:57:42.243]  In one hour, the film drops.
[02:57:42.243 --> 02:57:43.144]  You can't watch this.
[02:57:45.225 --> 02:57:48.828]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:57:48.828 --> 02:57:50.609]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:57:50.609 --> 02:58:02.659]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.659 --> 02:58:11.386]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:58:11.846 --> 02:58:17.810]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:58:17.810 --> 02:58:22.894]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:58:22.894 --> 02:58:25.496]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:58:25.496 --> 02:58:27.217]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:27.217 --> 02:58:32.041]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[02:58:32.261 --> 02:58:37.203]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:58:37.203 --> 02:58:39.864]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:58:39.864 --> 02:58:44.566]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:58:48.163 --> 02:58:50.024]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:58:50.024 --> 02:58:50.905]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[02:58:50.905 --> 02:58:52.266]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:58:52.266 --> 02:58:53.787]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:58:53.787 --> 02:58:54.588]  I'm so excited.
[02:58:54.588 --> 02:58:55.489]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:58:55.489 --> 02:58:57.970]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:58:57.970 --> 02:59:00.472]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[02:59:00.472 --> 02:59:01.893]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:01.893 --> 02:59:03.334]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:03.334 --> 02:59:04.756]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:04.756 --> 02:59:05.996]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:05.996 --> 02:59:10.740]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:59:10.740 --> 02:59:12.161]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:59:12.161 --> 02:59:13.442]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:59:13.442 --> 02:59:15.143]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:59:15.143 --> 02:59:15.864]  Like good.
[02:59:16.224 --> 02:59:16.804]  Whoa!
[02:59:16.804 --> 02:59:18.525]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:59:18.525 --> 02:59:22.707]  My daughter uses the Bubblegum Fluoride 3 toothpaste.
[02:59:22.707 --> 02:59:26.488]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[02:59:26.488 --> 02:59:28.529]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:59:28.529 --> 02:59:31.110]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[02:59:31.110 --> 02:59:31.850]  I'm thanking you.
[02:59:31.850 --> 02:59:38.293]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[02:59:38.293 --> 02:59:39.113]  It is next level.
[02:59:39.113 --> 02:59:39.694]  It really is good.
[02:59:39.694 --> 02:59:40.254]  So thank you.
[02:59:40.254 --> 02:59:42.175]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:59:42.175 --> 02:59:42.555]  Thank you.
[02:59:49.375 --> 02:59:51.999]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:26.235 --> 03:00:29.578]  Alright folks, the film comes out in an hour.
[03:00:29.578 --> 03:00:32.541]  It's about the censors, it's how they're trying to suppress everybody.
[03:00:32.541 --> 03:00:34.804]  It's the people that are really being blocked.
[03:00:34.804 --> 03:00:41.290]  It's important to champion this and it's important to support independent filmmakers that are telling the truth and have courage.
[03:00:41.290 --> 03:00:43.472]  Show everybody, ladies and gentlemen, right now.
[03:00:44.778 --> 03:00:46.479]  Should go to the website.
[03:00:46.479 --> 03:00:48.700]  We'll put it up on screen for you.
[03:00:48.700 --> 03:00:50.360]  CensoredMovie.com.
[03:00:50.360 --> 03:00:51.761]  What a great URL.
[03:00:51.761 --> 03:00:53.642]  I don't know how George got that.
[03:00:53.642 --> 03:00:55.282]  CensoredMovie.com.
[03:00:55.282 --> 03:00:57.563]  The main website is YouCan'tWatchThis.com.
[03:00:57.563 --> 03:01:03.306]  YouCan'tWatchThis.com is the name of the film and it's out in one hour.
[03:01:04.999 --> 03:01:09.503]  So, finishing up here, George, I appreciate you spending time with us today.
[03:01:09.503 --> 03:01:14.526]  Mike Adams is coming on with, I always say huge breaking news, but this is really big, bombshell.
[03:01:14.526 --> 03:01:25.234]  Bayer discovers black ops division run by Monsanto, shuts it down, initiates internal investigation as law enforcement prepares criminal charges against the chemical giant.
[03:01:25.234 --> 03:01:30.157]  Yes, this is Bayer putting HIV in your blood products.
[03:01:31.238 --> 03:01:33.079]  Monsanto doing any more criminal things.
[03:01:33.079 --> 03:01:34.880]  It's a eugenics cult.
[03:01:34.880 --> 03:01:36.260]  Trump's getting ready to bust it all.
[03:01:36.260 --> 03:01:37.841]  I told you this last week.
[03:01:37.841 --> 03:01:40.202]  So this is going to be huge with Mike Adams coming up.
[03:01:40.202 --> 03:01:41.402]  George, very exciting.
[03:01:41.402 --> 03:01:44.784]  I want to get you back on in the aftermath of the film coming out.
[03:01:44.784 --> 03:01:46.644]  I'm sure the censors are going to come after it.
[03:01:46.644 --> 03:01:47.285]  They haven't yet.
[03:01:47.285 --> 03:01:50.906]  It's not out yet, but it drops in one hour.
[03:01:50.906 --> 03:01:51.186]  Yep.
[03:01:51.186 --> 03:01:54.088]  So it's going to be on censoredmovie.com.
[03:01:54.088 --> 03:01:54.928]  It is coming out.
[03:01:55.660 --> 03:01:59.201]  As you say, in an hour, I'm so excited for this for this launch.
[03:01:59.201 --> 03:02:00.962]  I'm so excited for people to see it.
[03:02:00.962 --> 03:02:03.663]  I think it's going to be a really, really surprising take.
[03:02:03.663 --> 03:02:09.665]  It's it's something that hasn't been covered in this depth or this detail before.
[03:02:09.665 --> 03:02:12.966]  And the way that we've covered it is it's all about social media.
[03:02:12.966 --> 03:02:14.546]  It's all about free speech.
[03:02:14.546 --> 03:02:22.269]  The power that social media companies have on the Constitution, on the First Amendment and these new questions that are being raised.
[03:02:23.659 --> 03:02:25.879]  What is going to happen in America?
[03:02:25.879 --> 03:02:27.500]  What is going to happen to political discourse?
[03:02:27.500 --> 03:02:28.740]  What is going to happen to culture?
[03:02:28.740 --> 03:02:31.540]  What is going to happen when these people are gone?
[03:02:31.540 --> 03:02:32.901]  It's an amazing watch.
[03:02:32.901 --> 03:02:35.861]  I still get excited watching it back now.
[03:02:35.861 --> 03:02:38.462]  People aren't going to be disappointed.
[03:02:38.462 --> 03:02:40.502]  So it's on CensoredMovie.com.
[03:02:40.502 --> 03:02:43.082]  You can find out more information at YouCan'tWatchThis.com.
[03:02:43.082 --> 03:02:51.844]  We've actually created a code because the guys, since Caelan was on yesterday, the viewers have been amazing, sharing and getting involved.
[03:02:51.844 --> 03:02:52.724]  So we've created a code.
[03:02:53.224 --> 03:02:54.025]  It's InfoWars.
[03:02:54.025 --> 03:02:56.628]  If you go to the checkout, you can pre-order it now or buy it in an hour.
[03:02:56.628 --> 03:03:00.933]  If you go to the checkout, use the code InfoWars, you can get 10% off buying or renting the movie.
[03:03:00.933 --> 03:03:05.018]  Just because we wanted to say a little thank you to the people who have already been supporting this project.
[03:03:05.018 --> 03:03:13.167]  It's been such a passion project of mine and I'm really excited for these stories to be out there in a way that they haven't been before and people are going to see
[03:03:14.073 --> 03:03:22.280]  If you watch this movie, you're going to see a different side to all of the people involved, to Gavin, to Tommy, especially Laura and even you, Alex.
[03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:27.784]  I was very surprised coming to interview you and kind of learning a lot of new things about you that I didn't know.
[03:03:27.784 --> 03:03:29.725]  And there's a lot of that stuff in the movie as well.
[03:03:31.236 --> 03:03:42.285]  More than just a movie about a big issue right now, it's a real insight into not just the issue, but these characters as people, as individuals.
[03:03:42.285 --> 03:03:45.828]  So yeah, CensoredMovie.com or YouCan'tWatchThis.com.
[03:03:45.828 --> 03:03:47.770]  I'm really, really excited for people to see it.
[03:03:50.472 --> 03:03:52.554]  Well, I can't wait till they see the film.
[03:03:52.554 --> 03:03:53.894]  I can't wait to see the response.
[03:03:53.894 --> 03:03:55.976]  And, you know, I always just put films out for free.
[03:03:55.976 --> 03:03:59.959]  And I'd sell DVDs to fund them, but I would just put them out in general.
[03:03:59.959 --> 03:04:01.360]  A lot of times, you can't even do that now.
[03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:03.021]  And I know you guys flew all over the world to make this.
[03:04:03.021 --> 03:04:05.743]  You spend a lot of money making it, so people need to support you.
[03:04:05.743 --> 03:04:12.388]  But I wonder, because five banned individuals are even in this film, I wonder if YouTube will even let us or let you put this up.
[03:04:13.991 --> 03:04:16.854]  Yeah, it's a concern.
[03:04:16.854 --> 03:04:19.796]  We've got lots of backups as well.
[03:04:19.796 --> 03:04:22.078]  It's currently being hosted on Vimeo On Demand.
[03:04:22.078 --> 03:04:23.580]  They've actually been really great with us.
[03:04:24.550 --> 03:04:26.331]  Surprisingly, but we're worried.
[03:04:26.331 --> 03:04:28.232]  So we're getting DVDs.
[03:04:28.232 --> 03:04:29.292]  We're getting DVDs printed.
[03:04:29.292 --> 03:04:31.853]  So we're going to have DVDs available very soon as well.
[03:04:31.853 --> 03:04:33.574]  Because we need that insurance policy.
[03:04:33.574 --> 03:04:36.575]  We want as many people to see this movie as possible.
[03:04:36.575 --> 03:04:42.617]  We're scrimped and saved to make this movie.
[03:04:42.617 --> 03:04:48.899]  So we kind of, hopefully, we'll get a bit of money back so that we can do something similar and deal with similar important issues.
[03:04:48.899 --> 03:04:50.860]  But yeah, DVDs are going to be a big thing.
[03:04:50.860 --> 03:04:52.040]  Well, it's exciting, George.
[03:04:52.040 --> 03:04:52.941]  We're going to talk to you soon.
[03:04:52.941 --> 03:04:53.261]  Thank you.
[03:04:55.764 --> 03:04:57.392]  Please don't forget, we have.
[03:04:58.906 --> 03:05:01.027]  A lot of amazing deals on the site.
[03:05:01.027 --> 03:05:02.809]  We still have store-wide free shipping.
[03:05:02.809 --> 03:05:05.130]  We had to end all those big discounts on the supplements.
[03:05:05.130 --> 03:05:11.134]  We're about to sell out of all of them, but we still have a big discount going, even though it's about to sell out on DNA Force, our flagship, amazing product.
[03:05:11.134 --> 03:05:12.935]  Check out DNA Force and learn why it's so amazing.
[03:05:12.935 --> 03:05:13.815]  Do yourself a favor.

[03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:27.564]  If there's one thing you take, it should be DNA Force Plus with PQQ, CoQ10, and so much more.
[03:05:28.264 --> 03:05:29.105]  And all apparel.

[03:05:31.706 --> 03:05:32.606]  All apparel.

[03:05:33.487 --> 03:05:34.307]  T-shirts.
[03:05:34.307 --> 03:05:34.988]  Sweatshirts.
[03:05:34.988 --> 03:05:36.308]  Hoodies.

[03:05:48.994 --> 03:05:51.116]  It's discounted, but it's about to sell out.
[03:05:51.116 --> 03:05:51.636]  We'll be right back.
[03:06:01.400 --> 03:06:05.529]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[03:06:05.529 --> 03:06:09.739]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:09.739 --> 03:06:11.563]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:38.359 --> 03:06:39.760]  All right, folks.
[03:06:39.760 --> 03:06:50.747]  We've got Mike Adams coming up with some news that I don't want to use the word incredible or epic or insane or nightmarish.
[03:06:50.747 --> 03:07:00.674]  You know, you go watch a movie like Silence of the Lambs and oh, he's going to eat your liver with a fine Chianti.
[03:07:00.674 --> 03:07:03.116]  And it's like, oh, so scary.
[03:07:03.116 --> 03:07:07.279]  Anthony Hopkins eating your liver with a fine Italian red wine.
[03:07:08.780 --> 03:07:12.943]  And everyone, oh, is so shocked by it.
[03:07:12.943 --> 03:07:35.300]  But then a company like Bayer Pharmaceuticals that worked for Hitler, I should add, knowingly, over a decade, works with Hillary, Rodham Clinton, and Bill Clinton, and pays them millions of dollars through a Canadian company,
[03:07:38.086 --> 03:07:49.594]  To give them untested blood with HIV in it, but certified as clean, so they could give it to millions of people.
[03:07:49.594 --> 03:07:52.495]  Now, why would you do that?
[03:07:52.495 --> 03:07:54.617]  Well, it came out over a decade ago in the lawsuits.
[03:07:54.617 --> 03:08:00.721]  The executives said, there are too many hemophiliacs.
[03:08:05.319 --> 03:08:07.240]  You're like, that doesn't make sense.
[03:08:07.240 --> 03:08:11.622]  You know, I never played this last Friday.
[03:08:11.622 --> 03:08:17.185]  Do we have that clip off of what, like ABC News about the famous serial killer?
[03:08:17.185 --> 03:08:26.230]  That would climb up in people's homes at night and murder their little 10, 12, 13-year-old daughters like a vampire.
[03:08:26.230 --> 03:08:28.531]  Slit their throats just because they wanted to.
[03:08:29.605 --> 03:08:31.306]  By the way, these people are run-of-the-mill.
[03:08:31.306 --> 03:08:32.466]  You're like, why would he do that?
[03:08:32.466 --> 03:08:38.409]  Because why would Bayer seek out dirty blood?
[03:08:38.409 --> 03:08:42.791]  Because when you're a demon, you don't want money in the bank.
[03:08:42.791 --> 03:08:45.632]  Your daddy, Lucifer, gives you
[03:08:47.060 --> 03:08:49.502]  Fun coins.
[03:08:49.502 --> 03:08:53.565]  When you go to the Dave & Buster's, you get the tickets, you get to go get little toys and stuff.
[03:08:53.565 --> 03:08:55.026]  You're like, you know, kids want that.
[03:08:55.026 --> 03:08:56.568]  You don't want that.
[03:08:56.568 --> 03:09:03.433]  Psychopaths don't want to slit your kids throat and watch them beg for mommy because they get the energy from it.
[03:09:03.433 --> 03:09:07.557]  And all these mass murderers, they try to keep it out of the liberal news.
[03:09:07.557 --> 03:09:11.440]  Well, I've talked to the top psychiatrists that actually interview them.
[03:09:11.440 --> 03:09:13.181]  At the end of the day, they say, no, I have nightmares.
[03:09:13.181 --> 03:09:14.062]  Demons are attacking me.
[03:09:14.062 --> 03:09:15.343]  They're only nice when I kill children.
[03:09:16.397 --> 03:09:20.219]  They kill children because demons want them to.
[03:09:20.219 --> 03:09:36.108]  And remember, the governor of Virginia and the governor of New York are legalizing killing babies after they're born because that's their religion.
[03:09:36.108 --> 03:09:38.650]  And so those of us that aren't into this, we're like, that doesn't make sense.
[03:09:38.650 --> 03:09:42.752]  Because you don't want to climb a second story house and slit a little girl's throat.
[03:09:46.735 --> 03:09:52.537]  You don't understand that whatever this entity is that runs these people, it likes to kill babies.
[03:09:52.537 --> 03:09:54.698]  It likes to suck their energy.
[03:09:54.698 --> 03:09:59.940]  You keep saying that doesn't make sense, because you're not demon possessed.
[03:09:59.940 --> 03:10:02.821]  There's thousands of these serial killers.
[03:10:02.821 --> 03:10:04.022]  Let's just play one of these guys.
[03:10:04.022 --> 03:10:06.303]  You say, why would he do that?
[03:10:06.303 --> 03:10:09.804]  Why would Bayer want blood with HIV and hepatitis?
[03:10:09.804 --> 03:10:11.745]  Well, their executive said, we want to kill people.
[03:10:14.369 --> 03:10:20.093]  And if we've got a governor selling it to us, then the U.S.
[03:10:20.093 --> 03:10:28.158]  government, especially when it becomes president, will never get after us for other stuff with our drugs.
[03:10:28.158 --> 03:10:38.425]  If we have a governor paid $10 million to certify blood is clean that they know isn't, now you get into their sick mind game.
[03:10:38.425 --> 03:10:43.408]  When these guys get together at a golf course or something, man, they are just
[03:10:44.554 --> 03:10:52.116]  The power it gives them, the husbands and wives and their daughters and sons dying and begging for mommy and bleeding to death.
[03:10:52.116 --> 03:10:57.837]  You have to understand, to a Governor Northam or a Governor Clinton, this is, you don't understand their God.
[03:10:57.837 --> 03:11:02.939]  This is like beautiful music to them.
[03:11:02.939 --> 03:11:06.379]  Hurting you is their music.
[03:11:06.379 --> 03:11:09.220]  And you have to get in their mind.
[03:11:09.220 --> 03:11:12.241]  So here's a clip of one of their dumber
[03:11:13.254 --> 03:11:17.525]  Because you know, the smart ones become a governor, or they run operations.
[03:11:17.525 --> 03:11:21.414]  The dumb ones just climb in your roof at night and slit your daughter's throat.
[03:11:21.414 --> 03:11:21.655]  Here it is.
[03:11:22.931 --> 03:11:27.133]  The first time I killed somebody, it was such a rush.
[03:11:27.133 --> 03:11:31.815]  Tommy Lynn Sells, one of the most infamous serial killers in modern history.
[03:11:31.815 --> 03:11:35.057]  A man who says he belongs on death row.
[03:11:35.057 --> 03:11:37.738]  I was raised to do time.
[03:11:37.738 --> 03:11:42.841]  I wasn't raised to live out there in that world.
[03:11:42.841 --> 03:11:48.203]  Sells was convicted of killing 13-year-old Katie Harris, stabbing her to death in her bedroom.
[03:11:48.203 --> 03:11:49.264]  I liked to use a knife.
[03:11:51.165 --> 03:11:57.749]  A gun is too, too violent, too, too, too noisy, but just... Hit pause.
[03:11:57.749 --> 03:12:07.436]  ...fit my... Now you understand, you give someone HIV and hepatitis, and it kills them over ten years, and you get all their money, ooh, that's even slicker.
[03:12:07.436 --> 03:12:12.859]  It's kind of like in Gladiator, he kills four dudes real quick, and the guy goes, listen, you gotta chop them up slowly.
[03:12:12.859 --> 03:12:14.160]  This has gotta be done artfully.
[03:12:14.160 --> 03:12:15.001]  You understand, the art
[03:12:16.636 --> 03:12:28.169]  The art of getting doctors to give your kids stuff that'll give them HIV, and then watching your kids spend all the money on the drugs, and watching them die, that is a work of art to a Satanist.
[03:12:28.169 --> 03:12:28.750]  Let's continue.
[03:12:29.588 --> 03:12:32.911]  And later, he admitted to killing dozens more.
[03:12:32.911 --> 03:12:35.493]  So many, he says he can't even keep track.
[03:12:35.493 --> 03:12:40.617]  I'm not Billy the Kid making notches on my holster.
[03:12:40.617 --> 03:12:43.599]  So, I know it's been a lot.
[03:12:43.599 --> 03:12:46.882]  Addicted to killing is the way he characterized it.
[03:12:46.882 --> 03:12:48.883]  I don't have an on and off switch.
[03:12:48.883 --> 03:12:51.305]  I'm just after that drug.
[03:12:51.305 --> 03:12:51.906]  I'm after that...
[03:12:56.181 --> 03:12:59.704]  Nightline interviewed Sells on Death Row in 2010.
[03:12:59.704 --> 03:13:03.427]  One of the rare glimpses into the mind of a serial killer.
[03:13:03.427 --> 03:13:04.528]  It's complicated.
[03:13:04.528 --> 03:13:07.990]  It's... When people enter my life, they get hurt.
[03:13:12.554 --> 03:13:14.937]  When you look at me, you know what hate is.
[03:13:14.937 --> 03:13:16.358]  Because I don't know what love is.
[03:13:16.358 --> 03:13:18.000]  Two words I don't like to use is love and sorry.
[03:13:31.616 --> 03:13:32.656]  Because I'm about hate.
[03:13:32.656 --> 03:13:33.297]  A lot of jerking.
[03:13:33.297 --> 03:13:34.257]  A lot of movement.
[03:13:34.257 --> 03:13:34.717]  It's a physical...
[03:13:51.008 --> 03:13:55.669]  And described it all with seeming detachment from the horrors he caused.
[03:13:55.669 --> 03:13:58.530]  I don't have no feelings.
[03:13:58.530 --> 03:13:59.651]  No more.
[03:13:59.651 --> 03:14:00.491]  No emotion.
[03:14:00.491 --> 03:14:03.592]  No... And no remorse.
[03:14:03.592 --> 03:14:06.272]  I like to watch the eyes fading.
[03:14:06.272 --> 03:14:08.253]  The pupil fading.
[03:14:08.253 --> 03:14:12.074]  It's just like setting their soul free.
[03:14:12.074 --> 03:14:16.335]  We asked Sells what would happen if we said something that angered him.
[03:14:16.335 --> 03:14:17.516]  If we was in a fight and...
[03:14:20.425 --> 03:14:24.728]  If you don't get your head down in the concrete, then, you know, so be it.
[03:14:24.728 --> 03:14:27.389]  But, well, what do you think happened?
[03:14:27.389 --> 03:14:29.570]  It cracked like a coconut.
[03:14:29.570 --> 03:14:31.411]  So how did he become this monster?
[03:14:31.411 --> 03:14:36.714]  Sells blames much of his murderous rage on sexual abuse he says he suffered as a child.
[03:14:36.714 --> 03:14:38.455]  I think every time.
[03:14:38.455 --> 03:14:39.936]  So, see, he's a ghoul.
[03:14:39.936 --> 03:14:42.217]  He doesn't have any feelings.
[03:14:42.217 --> 03:14:46.520]  When he goes out and kills, though, the demon takes over and he gets the, he feels that energy.
[03:14:47.779 --> 03:14:53.513]  When we come back, Mike Adams is taking over, but I want to finish up with him describing going in a bedroom and slitting little girls' throats.
[03:14:55.959 --> 03:14:59.642]  Now, it's on record, they've convicted him, they've got undercover video.
[03:14:59.642 --> 03:15:17.396]  A lot of these abortion doctors, especially third trimester, they have sex with the baby while it's still alive, they have satanic rites, they drug the mothers, the mothers catch him, it's come out in the news, the police raid it, there's body parts in their office, films of the doctors having sex with the corpses, and that comes out in court, but not in the news.
[03:15:17.396 --> 03:15:21.620]  The news doesn't touch it, but from Texas to Missouri, to New York to California,
[03:15:22.895 --> 03:15:30.178]  These devil worshippers are running these third trimester facilities, not just selling the bodies, they rape them.
[03:15:30.178 --> 03:15:36.921]  And they get the baby out, they run down the hall, and then they rape the baby, then they drink his blood.
[03:15:36.921 --> 03:15:44.904]  Again, when I come back I'll show you one of their little minions talking about slitting little girls' throats, and how much he enjoys it.
[03:15:44.904 --> 03:15:46.744]  Are you going to stand up to him or not?
[03:15:46.744 --> 03:15:50.226]  That's who runs the Democratic Party, is the same spirit that runs this guy.
[03:15:53.581 --> 03:15:54.801]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.801 --> 03:15:58.722]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.722 --> 03:16:00.262]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:00.262 --> 03:16:03.223]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:03.223 --> 03:16:08.764]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.764 --> 03:16:09.984]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.984 --> 03:16:12.905]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.905 --> 03:16:15.125]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:15.125 --> 03:16:19.566]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:19.566 --> 03:16:21.867]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:23.047 --> 03:16:29.411]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.411 --> 03:16:32.452]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.452 --> 03:16:38.376]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.376 --> 03:16:42.158]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.158 --> 03:16:43.419]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.419 --> 03:16:44.759]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.759 --> 03:16:50.963]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.963 --> 03:16:52.404]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:53.109 --> 03:16:55.311]  Okay, so a watch is good, and some jewelry.
[03:16:55.311 --> 03:16:56.593]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[03:16:56.593 --> 03:16:57.614]  Hey, whatcha doin'?

[03:19:57.282 --> 03:20:05.885]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:05.885 --> 03:20:20.111]  Alright, Mike Adams is loaded for bear here.
[03:20:20.111 --> 03:20:23.192]  I've kind of gone to a rant about serial killers and mass murderers.
[03:20:24.431 --> 03:20:34.999]  This article bombshell Bayer discovers black ops division, run by Monsanto, shuts it down, initiates internal investigation as law enforcement prepares criminal charges against the chemical giant.
[03:20:34.999 --> 03:20:36.840]  That's at nationalnews.com.
[03:20:36.840 --> 03:20:39.722]  It's also been published at infowars.com.
[03:20:39.722 --> 03:20:42.825]  And if you know about Bayer's whole background, it's a eugenics organization.
[03:20:42.825 --> 03:20:43.745]  So is Monsanto.
[03:20:43.745 --> 03:20:44.906]  This is huge.
[03:20:44.906 --> 03:20:46.207]  He's taking over right now.
[03:20:46.207 --> 03:20:48.249]  But I wanted to finish up.
[03:20:49.673 --> 03:20:50.733]  I tried to get in this door right here.
[03:21:10.635 --> 03:21:14.540]  It was Katie Harris' murder that finally ended his killing spree.
[03:21:14.540 --> 03:21:19.526]  Two days later, Tommy Lynn Sells walked police through the crime scene.
[03:21:19.526 --> 03:21:22.690]  And I opened the window all the way up, about like this.
[03:21:22.690 --> 03:21:23.931]  And that's how it is.
[03:21:27.526 --> 03:21:31.849]  We kind of stayed up a little later and we got in a little fight about where we were all gonna sleep.
[03:21:31.849 --> 03:21:34.150]  We laid there and talked a bit.
[03:21:34.150 --> 03:21:38.053]  We talked about the time like Britney Spears and NSYNC.
[03:21:38.053 --> 03:21:42.596]  Crystal Searles, 10 years old at the time, is one of his few survivors.
[03:21:42.596 --> 03:21:45.298]  She was sleeping over at Katie's house that night.
[03:21:45.298 --> 03:21:49.441]  More than a decade later, it's all still fresh in her memory.
[03:21:49.441 --> 03:21:57.126]  I woke up startled a little bit and out of nowhere and I was kind of confused to a loud noise.
[03:21:59.375 --> 03:21:59.836]  I woke this girl up.
[03:21:59.836 --> 03:22:00.196]  I cut her bra.
[03:22:00.196 --> 03:22:01.137]  I stabbed her here.
[03:22:13.221 --> 03:22:18.745]  And then she jumped back and I cut her like this right here.
[03:22:18.745 --> 03:22:24.309]  He had a hand on her mouth and a knife on her neck and she's looking at me.
[03:22:24.309 --> 03:22:27.712]  I just cut her throat and she fell to the ground.
[03:22:27.712 --> 03:22:29.893]  She fell down right here.
[03:22:29.893 --> 03:22:33.076]  Thirteen-year-old Katie Harris laid dying on the floor.
[03:22:33.636 --> 03:22:40.124]  He was about to shut off the light and he looked one last time and he noticed that I was there and he didn't hesitate at all.
[03:22:40.124 --> 03:22:43.488]  I mean just shut the door came right back towards me with the knife.
[03:22:43.488 --> 03:22:46.452]  I walked over here and I went like this.
[03:22:46.452 --> 03:22:53.060]  The only thing that he said is move your hands because I had him up here and he reached over the top bunk and cut my cut my neck.
[03:22:55.211 --> 03:23:00.313]  Cells sliced Crystal's neck, severing her windpipe and gracing her carotid artery.
[03:23:00.313 --> 03:23:01.594]  I am very sure... Let's stop there.
[03:23:01.594 --> 03:23:02.534]  I'm going to have Mike take over.
[03:23:02.534 --> 03:23:03.635]  I appreciate him doing the fourth hour.
[03:23:03.635 --> 03:23:06.796]  He understands I wanted to segue into this, though.
[03:23:06.796 --> 03:23:09.537]  Again, you can all day go research about criminology.
[03:23:09.537 --> 03:23:11.178]  The really smart ones get in control.
[03:23:11.738 --> 03:23:15.119]  Bayer knowingly gave millions HIV and hepatitis.
[03:23:15.119 --> 03:23:17.760]  Monsanto knowingly does all this.
[03:23:17.760 --> 03:23:20.841]  And if you understand these people, you understand it all.
[03:23:20.841 --> 03:23:22.961]  The anti-human exterminist program.
[03:23:22.961 --> 03:23:23.982]  Mike Adams takes over.
[03:23:23.982 --> 03:23:25.542]  This story is so huge.
[03:23:25.542 --> 03:23:27.243]  It's all breaking.
[03:23:27.243 --> 03:23:29.063]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[03:23:29.063 --> 03:23:30.904]  And make no mistake, it's because Trump is in office.
[03:23:30.904 --> 03:23:31.344]  Mike Adams.
[03:23:32.577 --> 03:23:44.442]  Okay, Bayer is freaking out because of the multi-billion dollar jury damage decisions that are now threatening to bankrupt, financially annihilate Bayer because of its acquisition of Monsanto.
[03:23:44.442 --> 03:23:50.064]  It took on all of this, well, this coming debt, all the damage.
[03:23:50.644 --> 03:23:57.011]  That Glyphosate Roundup has done to people over the last four decades or so is now coming to bear.
[03:23:57.011 --> 03:24:12.426]  And Bayer is being forced to pay out what could be a trillion dollars because there are 13,400 lawsuits pending now against Bayer over Monsanto's crimes against humanity.
[03:24:13.767 --> 03:24:18.733]  Bayer is receiving, by my estimate, 20 to 30 new lawsuits a day.
[03:24:18.733 --> 03:24:20.555]  I mean, imagine that, Alex.
[03:24:20.555 --> 03:24:28.765]  You've been sued many times by many people, but imagine getting 20 to 30 new lawsuits a day, every business day.
[03:24:28.765 --> 03:24:32.610]  That's what Bayer is subjected to because of their acquisition of Monsanto.
[03:24:33.226 --> 03:24:37.789]  Well, Bayer began an internal investigation of Monsanto.
[03:24:37.789 --> 03:24:41.450]  I think Bayer was tricked in a way.
[03:24:41.450 --> 03:24:56.999]  I think Monsanto committed fraud during its acquisition and probably hid many elements from Bayer by committing an internal money laundering and financial fraud to hide what I'm calling the Black Ops division of Monsanto, which Bayer has now become aware of.
[03:24:57.702 --> 03:25:03.244]  So Bayer has issued a public apology on May 12th, just a few days ago.
[03:25:03.244 --> 03:25:07.205]  This is in the link, in the story that's now on Infowars.com.
[03:25:07.205 --> 03:25:16.388]  Bayer's statement saying that they will work with law enforcement and the investigations into the criminality.
[03:25:16.388 --> 03:25:20.269]  Saying that they shut down this black ops division of Monsanto.
[03:25:20.269 --> 03:25:24.751]  Saying that they fired the former Monsanto operators and that they regret
[03:25:25.419 --> 03:25:32.767]  That this Black Ops division was running hit lists of journalists and lawmakers and regulators.
[03:25:32.767 --> 03:25:36.471]  And my name has been on that so-called hit list for many, many years.
[03:25:36.471 --> 03:25:37.932]  Yours too, Alex.
[03:25:37.932 --> 03:25:41.756]  The Food Babe, Jeffrey Smith, Joseph Mercola, many others.
[03:25:41.756 --> 03:25:46.061]  Everybody who has criticized Monsanto and has had influence has been on that list.
[03:25:47.362 --> 03:25:51.283]  Now, Bayer is trying to make amends because they are desperate.
[03:25:51.283 --> 03:26:05.167]  They know that the juries that are making these decisions which will bankrupt Bayer, the juries read websites like Natural News and they read InfoWars.com and they read Mercola.com or ResponsibleTechnology.org.
[03:26:05.167 --> 03:26:14.310]  And as you said, this is total vindication because I remember 20 years ago being threatened by Monsanto about Roundup and all of it's coming out, all of it's coming out about Bayer
[03:26:15.453 --> 03:26:18.878]  And Bayer, as you said, it's right here in the article, but it's getting no coverage.
[03:26:18.878 --> 03:26:20.440]  They're like, hey, there's a secret group.
[03:26:20.440 --> 03:26:21.562]  We didn't know this was happening.
[03:26:21.562 --> 03:26:26.889]  But, well, of course, Monsanto is literally the eugenics black ops command base.
[03:26:26.889 --> 03:26:28.551]  And who's involved?
[03:26:28.551 --> 03:26:29.693]  Bill Gates, all of it.
[03:26:29.693 --> 03:26:31.095]  It's all beginning to come down.
[03:26:31.095 --> 03:26:31.755]  This is incredible.
[03:26:32.918 --> 03:26:50.801]  I am now starting to go public with this show, and there's a lot more coming out over the next few days, and I am saying publicly, I'm going to kind of stick my neck out here, I am saying I will meet with Bayer's independent law firm that's going to run this internal investigation, as long as my lawyers are present.
[03:26:51.321 --> 03:27:05.511]  I will meet with them and I will detail all of the crimes, the intimidation, the coercion, the threats, the defamation, the death squads that I believe are run by Monsanto or were run by Monsanto before this was shut down.
[03:27:05.511 --> 03:27:08.833]  I will detail all that to Bayer if they want to know.
[03:27:08.833 --> 03:27:15.398]  But they need to publicly apologize by name to all of us who have been victimized, who have been targeted
[03:27:15.979 --> 03:27:21.104]  By these Monsanto black ops over all of these years, Bayer needs to come clean.
[03:27:21.104 --> 03:27:32.715]  Otherwise, I think that the juries of the United States, and remember there are 13,000 plus pending cases, I think the juries are going to continue to see Bayer as just as evil as Monsanto.
[03:27:33.487 --> 03:27:37.750]  Bayer needs to apologize, and you know, Bayer's got a whole history of evil, as you've talked about.
[03:27:37.750 --> 03:27:41.692]  I was about to say, the only group more evil than Bayer is Monsanto.
[03:27:41.692 --> 03:27:48.816]  How would Bayer get induced to buy a company like this, in the middle of it being admitted that it causes cancer with its main product?
[03:27:48.816 --> 03:27:50.477]  Something weird's going on here.
[03:27:50.477 --> 03:27:56.621]  Well, they thought that they could influence the juries, maybe buy off the judges, threaten the journalists.
[03:27:56.621 --> 03:27:57.221]  Well, guess what?
[03:27:57.972 --> 03:28:00.613]  The media has now turned against Monsanto.
[03:28:00.613 --> 03:28:03.435]  This has just happened with this third court decision.
[03:28:03.435 --> 03:28:08.757]  Mainstream media now, the same media that used to apologize for Monsanto and say Glyphosate was perfectly safe.
[03:28:08.757 --> 03:28:09.197]  Oh, remember?
[03:28:09.197 --> 03:28:10.558]  We were the conspiracy theorists.
[03:28:10.558 --> 03:28:12.339]  We used to get taken off YouTube and stuff.
[03:28:12.339 --> 03:28:15.060]  Oh, Glyphosate's good for you.
[03:28:15.060 --> 03:28:15.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:28:15.680 --> 03:28:19.362]  Well, now the media is saying that Glyphosate is linked to cancer.
[03:28:19.362 --> 03:28:21.063]  There's going to be a snowball effect here, Alex.
[03:28:21.932 --> 03:28:22.333]  Stay there.
[03:28:22.333 --> 03:28:24.896]  And for those who don't know, any cancer doctor will tell you.
[03:28:24.896 --> 03:28:25.376]  It's a fact.
[03:28:42.293 --> 03:28:45.399]  Roundup grows cancers.
[03:28:45.399 --> 03:28:47.683]  Mike Adams takes over with this huge news.
[03:28:47.683 --> 03:28:48.764]  Folks, this is so huge.

[03:28:56.817 --> 03:28:57.698]  Hey, whatcha doin'?

[03:31:04.634 --> 03:31:05.575]  Thanks for calling, Tom.

[03:31:17.303 --> 03:31:18.283]  God bless you, brother.
[03:31:18.283 --> 03:31:25.128]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[03:31:25.268 --> 03:31:26.369]  You're our only hope, brother.
[03:31:26.369 --> 03:31:28.689]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.

[03:31:55.781 --> 03:32:01.285]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist pirates!
[03:32:01.285 --> 03:32:08.790]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[03:32:08.790 --> 03:32:10.111]  Are you coming back?
[03:32:10.111 --> 03:32:11.252]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[03:32:11.852 --> 03:32:13.014]  We're at Newshorse.com.
[03:32:13.014 --> 03:32:15.477]  Paul Watts has launched his own Summit.news.

[03:32:33.910 --> 03:32:35.431]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[03:32:35.431 --> 03:32:38.153]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.

[03:32:56.864 --> 03:32:59.506]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[03:33:19.946 --> 03:33:22.747]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.419 --> 03:33:33.088]  I'm going to break down this bombshell news for you here and go over the shocking details here in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:33.088 --> 03:33:40.798]  I'm Mike Adams and both Alex and myself were targeted by Monsanto Black Ops teams over the last 10 plus years.
[03:33:41.458 --> 03:33:54.290]  And Bayer, which acquired Monsanto roughly a year ago, has discovered that Monsanto was running this Black Ops division, and Bayer says they've shut it down, and Bayer has posted a public apology.
[03:33:54.290 --> 03:33:56.092]  There's a lot more to this story.
[03:33:56.092 --> 03:34:00.496]  The full details are currently posted at Infowars.com and my site, Natural News.
[03:34:01.557 --> 03:34:03.559]  Here's the headline, just to get you into this.
[03:34:03.559 --> 03:34:13.930]  Bayer discovers Black Ops Division, run by Monsanto, shuts it down, initiates an internal investigation as law enforcement prepares criminal charges against the chemical giant.
[03:34:14.617 --> 03:34:19.380]  So, this story quotes Reuters as well as Bayer.com.
[03:34:19.380 --> 03:34:36.572]  Bayer posted a statement on May 12th in response to what had been uncovered by a group in France that found out that its journalists and investigators were being targeted on a hit list that was maintained by the Monsanto, what I'm calling the Black Ops Division of Monsanto.
[03:34:37.344 --> 03:34:37.984]  Now, the U.S.
[03:34:37.984 --> 03:34:47.246]  Right to Know organization out in California had used FOIA requests over the last couple of years to uncover a lot of the details about this black ops group.
[03:34:47.246 --> 03:35:03.369]  For example, uncovering the fact that they spent millions of dollars trying to target specific journalists and activists in the United States, including myself and Food Babe, and that they would hire negative PR firms to run smear campaigns, defamation campaigns.
[03:35:03.369 --> 03:35:06.890]  They would bribe journalists and they would run paid Wikipedia editors
[03:35:07.828 --> 03:35:18.533]  To publish false smears about you and then get those smears repeated in the press using a scheme that I call the Wikipedia Shuffle, which I will explain here in an upcoming segment.
[03:35:18.533 --> 03:35:22.795]  This is how they smear you and try to create facts out of lies.
[03:35:22.795 --> 03:35:29.878]  And this is the same kind of deep state operation that they've run against Alex Jones and of course against President Trump as well.
[03:35:29.878 --> 03:35:34.360]  So Bayer became aware of this after they acquired Monsanto, I believe.
[03:35:34.360 --> 03:35:37.221]  It looks to me like Monsanto committed a major fraud.
[03:35:37.819 --> 03:35:44.202]  That its managers and perhaps certain shareholders committed fraud and hid these facts from Bayer.
[03:35:44.202 --> 03:35:57.448]  Now Bayer has its own evil history of being involved with IG Farben and the Third Reich and the Holocaust, actually running medical, chemical weapons experiments on Jewish prisoners of war during the Holocaust.
[03:35:57.448 --> 03:35:59.349]  That's the real history of Bayer.
[03:35:59.349 --> 03:36:04.912]  I mean, Bayer's chairperson was sentenced to prison in the Nuremberg trials for crimes against humanity.
[03:36:04.912 --> 03:36:05.392]  That's real.
[03:36:06.337 --> 03:36:09.780]  And Bayer has apologized for its role in the Holocaust, by the way.
[03:36:09.780 --> 03:36:22.050]  Well, now in acquiring Monsanto, Bayer has inherited not only the legal liability of Monsanto and its toxic, deadly, cancer-causing Roundup product, i.e.
[03:36:22.050 --> 03:36:22.791]  glyphosate.
[03:36:22.791 --> 03:36:24.432]  Roundup is just the brand name.
[03:36:24.432 --> 03:36:26.874]  Glyphosate is the world's number one weed killer.
[03:36:26.874 --> 03:36:31.098]  And now three juries in the United States have found Bayer
[03:36:31.798 --> 03:36:41.301]  Because it owns Monsanto, liable for the cancers, specifically non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cancers that have been caused by Monsanto's products.
[03:36:41.301 --> 03:36:51.003]  Now, Bayer acquired Monsanto for anywhere from $63 billion to $66.6 billion, depending on which figure you believe.
[03:36:51.003 --> 03:36:55.024]  There's some different interpretations of the exact amount, but it's in the $60 billion range.
[03:36:57.870 --> 03:37:07.498]  What Bayer did not realize is that they were taking hold of over a trillion dollars in potential liability that could financially annihilate the Bayer company.
[03:37:07.498 --> 03:37:15.344]  So since they acquired Monsanto, in the months since then, Bayer has lost 40% of its stock value.
[03:37:15.344 --> 03:37:21.649]  It has collapsed to the point where Bayer's shareholders are panicking and they're demanding Bayer do something.
[03:37:22.293 --> 03:37:35.565]  I believe it is in the aftermath of that demand and a vote of no confidence against Bayer's CEO that Bayer began an internal investigation to try to find out what the heck did they acquire when they acquired Monsanto?
[03:37:36.300 --> 03:37:49.135]  And it turns out Bayer discovered that Monsanto was running a black ops division with Hitless and with, I believe, actual wet work death squads that have targeted myself and others in the industry.
[03:37:49.135 --> 03:37:56.524]  And I am willing to testify to that in front of Bayer's new legal team that they have hired to investigate Monsanto.
[03:37:57.592 --> 03:37:58.734]  Isn't this interesting?
[03:37:58.734 --> 03:38:00.396]  This is all coming out.
[03:38:00.396 --> 03:38:04.081]  So now, Bayer is trying to fight for its own survival.
[03:38:04.081 --> 03:38:12.192]  Bayer knows that the juries in the United States are going to continue to punish the company for the evil that Monsanto committed.
[03:38:12.192 --> 03:38:15.156]  This evil is worth billions of dollars in the minds of the jury.
[03:38:16.728 --> 03:38:21.090]  The jury, you know, the science of all this is debated by Bayer.
[03:38:21.090 --> 03:38:25.493]  You know, Bayer's lawyers say that glyphosate is perfectly safe in their minds.
[03:38:25.493 --> 03:38:27.275]  The juries have decided it's not safe.
[03:38:27.275 --> 03:38:28.836]  The juries have decided it causes cancer.
[03:38:28.836 --> 03:38:33.759]  But more importantly, the juries have tacked on, in this latest case, a billion dollars!
[03:38:34.568 --> 03:38:39.550]  Of punitive damages against Bayer because of how evil the corporation is.
[03:38:39.550 --> 03:38:50.794]  Well, what Bayer is just starting to realize is that a lot of these jurists, no doubt, have read InfoWars, or have read Natural News, or have read The Food Babe, or have read U.S.
[03:38:50.794 --> 03:38:57.317]  Right to Know, or other groups that have been telling the truth about Monsanto and its cover-ups and its deadly products all these years.
[03:38:58.163 --> 03:39:04.586]  And so, these juries can financially annihilate Bayer, and they're actually in the process of doing that.
[03:39:04.586 --> 03:39:10.909]  And if Bayer doesn't stop this hemorrhaging, Bayer is going to be obliterated, financially.
[03:39:10.909 --> 03:39:13.290]  Again, over a trillion dollars in potential liability.
[03:39:13.290 --> 03:39:19.853]  So this is why I believe Bayer has appointed a person now named Matthias Berninger.
[03:39:19.853 --> 03:39:23.075]  And this is in my story there on Infowars.com.
[03:39:23.075 --> 03:39:24.015]  Or Matthias, sorry.
[03:39:24.015 --> 03:39:24.976]  Matthias Berninger
[03:39:25.737 --> 03:39:34.641]  If I have the pronunciation correct, who spoke to Reuters, which covered this as well, and also put out the statement at media.bayer.com.
[03:39:34.641 --> 03:39:48.547]  This is on Bayer's website, where Berninger apologizes and admits that they sought to destroy individuals, journalists, and lawmakers, and regulators, and that they kept hit lists of hundreds of names.
[03:39:48.547 --> 03:39:51.828]  And he says that they acquired non-public information.
[03:39:52.944 --> 03:40:00.931]  And he says that this was wrong, he apologizes, and he says that Bayer is going to cooperate with law enforcement's investigations.
[03:40:00.931 --> 03:40:21.908]  And now the law enforcement authorities in France have begun criminal investigations into Bayer for this, what I believe is extremely criminal behavior that is, it's, this is like a mafia death squad intimidation campaign that targeted journalists and scientists and lawmakers and regulators.
[03:40:22.762 --> 03:40:24.483]  And destroyed people.
[03:40:24.483 --> 03:40:28.344]  In some cases I believe physically harmed them or even killed them.
[03:40:28.344 --> 03:40:33.465]  And I do believe that Bayer had no idea that this was going on in Monsanto.
[03:40:33.465 --> 03:40:35.326]  Not excusing anything about Bayer's history.
[03:40:35.326 --> 03:40:37.106]  They've done plenty of evil themselves.
[03:40:37.106 --> 03:40:38.687]  But I think they were hoodwinked.
[03:40:38.687 --> 03:40:41.807]  I think they had no idea what Monsanto was doing.
[03:40:41.807 --> 03:40:46.689]  And I think they now have a crisis on their hands that is about to explode globally.
[03:40:46.689 --> 03:40:47.069]  You know why?
[03:40:47.679 --> 03:41:09.026]  Because all of us that Monsanto tried to silence, and coerce, and destroy our reputations, and even in some cases they tried to physically threaten or even kill some of us, we are still alive and we are still talking, and we have big platforms, and we have a lot of followers, and we are demanding an apology from Bayer, and we are not going to be silent about this.
[03:41:09.026 --> 03:41:16.068]  Because this isn't, of course, as big as the Holocaust when Bayer was complicit in the mass murder of six million Jews,
[03:41:16.835 --> 03:41:24.217]  But this is in the same kind of evil spirit as that which is destroying the lives of innocent people for corporate profits.
[03:41:24.217 --> 03:41:26.637]  And we're not letting this go.
[03:41:26.637 --> 03:41:40.520]  I have my legal team reaching out today to Bayer's legal team to demand public apologies and demand that Bayer come clean with the crimes that were carried out by Monsanto and that Bayer retract
[03:41:41.158 --> 03:41:53.129]  The smears and the defamation articles that they put out there that were republished by the liberal media with outrageous lies about all of us who are anti-GMO activists as we're called.
[03:41:53.129 --> 03:42:02.618]  And by the way, isn't it interesting that this is happening at the same time that the deep state is now about to get hammered by William Barr
[03:42:03.371 --> 03:42:10.073]  And the Trump administration officials who are exposing the treason and the criminality of the deep state.
[03:42:10.073 --> 03:42:20.837]  This is an amazing time to be alive and it's an amazing time to tune into Infowars.com or any of us in the independent media because the tables are beginning to turn.
[03:42:20.837 --> 03:42:21.637]  We have endured
[03:42:22.307 --> 03:42:24.689]  They did not succeed in murdering us.
[03:42:24.689 --> 03:42:25.490]  We are still here.
[03:42:25.490 --> 03:42:26.691]  We still have platforms.
[03:42:26.691 --> 03:42:33.718]  And they've made us, in one sense, stronger than ever and more determined than ever to achieve victory for humanity.
[03:42:33.718 --> 03:42:35.219]  We couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:42:35.219 --> 03:42:38.923]  So I thank you for all your support, all our organizations.

[03:42:51.229 --> 03:42:53.571]  It's Alex Jones.

[03:44:05.151 --> 03:44:11.356]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with.
[03:44:11.356 --> 03:44:13.478]  And it's been the big craze for at least a decade.

[03:44:54.688 --> 03:44:59.233]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA Region 6.
[03:44:59.233 --> 03:45:01.275]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:45:01.275 --> 03:45:02.357]  Good to talk to you.
[03:45:02.357 --> 03:45:07.002]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[03:45:07.002 --> 03:45:08.944]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[03:45:08.944 --> 03:45:13.509]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[03:45:13.789 --> 03:45:19.756]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[03:45:19.756 --> 03:45:20.536]  I appreciate that.
[03:45:20.536 --> 03:45:22.138]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:45:22.138 --> 03:45:22.739]  Tell us about it.
[03:45:22.739 --> 03:45:23.520]  Well, it's really great.
[03:45:23.520 --> 03:45:24.801]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:45:24.801 --> 03:45:25.261]  I take it.
[03:45:25.261 --> 03:45:26.062]  It tastes good.
[03:45:26.062 --> 03:45:27.924]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:45:27.924 --> 03:45:29.866]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:45:29.866 --> 03:45:33.330]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[03:45:33.370 --> 03:45:36.212]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:45:36.212 --> 03:45:37.953]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:45:37.953 --> 03:45:40.035]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:45:40.035 --> 03:45:40.956]  So, yeah.
[03:45:40.956 --> 03:45:43.398]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[03:45:43.398 --> 03:45:46.220]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[03:45:46.220 --> 03:45:47.361]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[03:45:47.361 --> 03:45:49.242]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:45:49.242 --> 03:45:50.123]  Okay, it's true.
[03:45:50.123 --> 03:45:56.167]  I stayed up late last night, so I had to.
[03:46:52.509 --> 03:46:57.772]  And get the fish oil.
[03:46:57.772 --> 03:47:13.761]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.761 --> 03:47:14.981]  You found it.
[03:47:14.981 --> 03:47:17.022]  The tip of the spear.
[03:47:17.022 --> 03:47:21.585]  It is The Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:47:24.457 --> 03:47:30.562]  Bayer is facing financial annihilation unless it cleans up this Monsanto mess that it has inherited.
[03:47:30.562 --> 03:47:36.887]  It's probably the worst acquisition decision ever in the history of corporations.
[03:47:36.887 --> 03:47:54.100]  They purchased Monsanto for 60 plus billion dollars and inherited a trillion dollar liability and a black ops division that has been running criminal coercion and violence operations against journalists and regulators and lawmakers all around the world.
[03:47:54.640 --> 03:47:56.981]  European authorities are already aware of this now.
[03:47:56.981 --> 03:47:58.982]  Law enforcement investigations have begun.
[03:47:58.982 --> 03:48:04.664]  And according to reports in Reuters, it's going to spread to other European nations.
[03:48:04.664 --> 03:48:07.765]  Now, remember that Bayer is a German company.
[03:48:07.765 --> 03:48:12.127]  It's an offshoot of IG Farben, which worked with Adolf Hitler in the Third Reich.
[03:48:12.127 --> 03:48:13.868]  That's a true part of history.
[03:48:13.868 --> 03:48:20.110]  But this means that the United Kingdom is going to be looking at this, as well as German authorities themselves.
[03:48:21.118 --> 03:48:31.485]  Wondering, why did a German corporation acquire an American company that has been running a criminal black ops unit for over a decade?
[03:48:31.485 --> 03:48:36.128]  That's a big question for German officials, French officials, UK officials, as well as U.S.
[03:48:36.128 --> 03:48:37.048]  officials.
[03:48:37.048 --> 03:48:45.354]  And it's interesting to me that in the United States, juries, I think, took it a little bit easier on Monsanto when Monsanto was a U.S.
[03:48:45.354 --> 03:48:46.554]  corporation.
[03:48:46.554 --> 03:48:50.397]  Now that Monsanto has been acquired by a German corporation and is owned by Bayer,
[03:48:51.184 --> 03:48:52.264]  It seems that U.S.
[03:48:52.264 --> 03:48:58.226]  juries are punishing this corporation far more than they would have otherwise.
[03:48:58.226 --> 03:49:01.846]  So, in other words, it's like the Monsanto court cases.
[03:49:01.846 --> 03:49:17.450]  The juries are finding these multi-billion dollar awards because Bayer is a German corporation, perhaps with a history of involvement in the Third Reich and the actual Holocaust, the chemical murder, the mass murder of Jews.
[03:49:17.450 --> 03:49:19.430]  That's a true history that they don't want you to remember.
[03:49:19.983 --> 03:49:23.826]  We're trying to bury history as quickly as possible.
[03:49:23.826 --> 03:49:30.530]  I'm going to introduce you today to what I call the Wikipedia Shuffle.
[03:49:30.530 --> 03:49:31.611]  Explain how this works.
[03:49:31.611 --> 03:49:37.595]  This is something that Monsanto did to smear all of the activists using Wikipedia.
[03:49:37.595 --> 03:49:39.236]  Here's how it works.
[03:49:39.236 --> 03:49:44.459]  First, they bribed Wikipedia editors to fabricate a fake smear.
[03:49:44.459 --> 03:49:47.261]  I'm going to use a fake name as an example for this.
[03:49:47.261 --> 03:49:49.683]  Let's say there's somebody out there named Food Bob.
[03:49:50.350 --> 03:49:52.392]  Not the Food Babe, but Food Bob.
[03:49:52.392 --> 03:49:53.133]  It's fictitious.
[03:49:53.133 --> 03:49:54.735]  I don't know anybody named Food Bob.
[03:49:54.735 --> 03:49:57.457]  But let's say they want to smear Food Bob.
[03:49:57.457 --> 03:50:07.768]  So they'll bribe Wikipedia editors to put something on Food Bob's Wikipedia page that claims Food Bob was busted for, I don't know, child pornography or anything.
[03:50:07.768 --> 03:50:09.169]  They could make up anything.
[03:50:09.169 --> 03:50:12.993]  Maybe he hired prostitutes to urinate on hotel beds in Russia, right?
[03:50:12.993 --> 03:50:13.694]  I mean, this kind of thing.
[03:50:14.446 --> 03:50:35.384]  So then, those same people who coordinated this, who were working for Monsanto, then they push this citation on Wikipedia out to other left-wing media outlets that they know will publish this information, and then those left-wing media outlets in some cases have editors who are also on the payroll.
[03:50:35.384 --> 03:50:38.247]  So they publish a story that cites the Wikipedia entry.
[03:50:39.019 --> 03:50:42.740]  So, you know, I'm not going to name names, but you know all the typical left-wing rags.
[03:50:42.740 --> 03:50:46.541]  They're out there and they'll say, well, Food Bob was busted for child porn.
[03:50:46.541 --> 03:50:53.742]  Then, the original editors back at Wikipedia delete their original fabrication because they can't support it.
[03:50:53.742 --> 03:50:57.503]  It may have only existed on the Wikipedia page for two hours.
[03:50:57.503 --> 03:51:04.084]  Instead, they now cite the new left-wing media story that originally cited the fake Wikipedia falsehood.
[03:51:05.003 --> 03:51:09.826]  Because now that it's cited by a left-wing media publisher, it's considered what?
[03:51:09.826 --> 03:51:11.167]  A fact.
[03:51:11.167 --> 03:51:12.088]  So it's now a fact.
[03:51:12.088 --> 03:51:15.871]  This is how they launder a lie into a fact.
[03:51:15.871 --> 03:51:17.932]  And they've done this to Donald Trump.
[03:51:17.932 --> 03:51:19.373]  They've done this to Alex Jones.
[03:51:19.373 --> 03:51:20.934]  They've done this to Julian Assange.
[03:51:20.934 --> 03:51:22.395]  They've done it to everybody.
[03:51:22.395 --> 03:51:25.918]  All of us who are clean food advocates and independent journalists.
[03:51:25.918 --> 03:51:27.639]  They've done it to Sheryl Atkinson.
[03:51:27.639 --> 03:51:28.740]  You know, everybody.
[03:51:28.740 --> 03:51:29.320]  Edward Snowden.
[03:51:29.320 --> 03:51:30.741]  You name it.
[03:51:30.741 --> 03:51:31.862]  It's called the Wikipedia shuffle.
[03:51:32.990 --> 03:51:47.516]  And it allows Wikipedia to have all these lies and smears about people who are targeted by the biotech deep state, the vaccine deep state, the political deep state, the financial deep state, the military industrial deep state.
[03:51:47.516 --> 03:51:52.638]  Any of these organizations that can have control over Wikipedia editors, this is how they do it.
[03:51:52.638 --> 03:51:55.579]  It's kind of like an editorial bait-and-switch operation.
[03:51:56.215 --> 03:52:02.537]  This is one reason why Section 230 of the CDA needs to be completely reformed or shut down.
[03:52:02.537 --> 03:52:12.881]  Because Wikipedia has absolute legal immunity to publish outright smears about any political targets and Monsanto ran this operation for 10 years plus.
[03:52:12.881 --> 03:52:16.723]  They did this and Bayer has only now started to figure it out.
[03:52:16.723 --> 03:52:18.964]  So that's how the Wikipedia shuffle works.
[03:52:18.964 --> 03:52:23.685]  Now getting back to Bayer and what they're going to have to do in this case.
[03:52:23.685 --> 03:52:25.286]  Remember Bayer manufactures
[03:52:25.994 --> 03:52:34.520]  Not just, now, glyphosate and agricultural chemicals, but pharmaceuticals as well as over-the-counter medicines.
[03:52:34.520 --> 03:52:36.741]  And they have a big agricultural division, too.
[03:52:36.741 --> 03:52:40.123]  You know, fertilizers and such, not just pesticides and herbicides.
[03:52:40.123 --> 03:52:42.685]  Bayer has all these divisions.
[03:52:42.685 --> 03:52:49.029]  Every one of these divisions is now at risk because of Bayer's acquisition of Monsanto.
[03:52:49.784 --> 03:52:53.086]  And because of all the liability that comes with that, and because of all the lies that have been discovered.
[03:52:53.086 --> 03:52:57.148]  In other words, Bayer just acquired a poison.
[03:52:57.148 --> 03:52:58.709]  Which is ironic.
[03:52:58.709 --> 03:53:03.132]  Because, of course, Monsanto has been poisoning the world for decades.
[03:53:03.132 --> 03:53:06.014]  And now Monsanto has become poison to Bayer.
[03:53:06.014 --> 03:53:09.496]  Remember, Monsanto created Agent Orange.
[03:53:09.496 --> 03:53:12.718]  And Agent Orange was a chemical weapon that was deployed against
[03:53:13.721 --> 03:53:19.546]  Unarmed civilians as a weapon of mass destruction during the Vietnam War and even many U.S.
[03:53:19.546 --> 03:53:22.048]  veterans were exposed to Agent Orange.
[03:53:22.048 --> 03:53:23.369]  That's Monsanto!
[03:53:23.369 --> 03:53:32.396]  There are many other chemicals over the years and they've used the same thing time and time again to intimidate scientists, to bribe journalists, to run black ops for decades.
[03:53:32.396 --> 03:53:34.037]  This isn't new.
[03:53:34.037 --> 03:53:38.400]  And guess where the Monsanto black ops, guess where they got their training?
[03:53:38.400 --> 03:53:39.941]  You'll find this interesting.
[03:53:39.941 --> 03:53:40.522]  Big tobacco.
[03:53:41.576 --> 03:53:50.823]  Big tobacco ran the same thing from the 1940s all the way up through the early 1990s, before the major settlements with the government.
[03:53:50.823 --> 03:53:57.528]  Big tobacco ran the same exact campaigns, and in many cases it was the same exact people.
[03:53:57.528 --> 03:54:10.778]  And big tobacco would threaten and intimidate the scientists and the whistleblowers, even those inside big tobacco that were saying, hey, cigarette smoking promotes heart disease, promotes cancer, you know, promotes all these problems.
[03:54:10.778 --> 03:54:11.319]  It's toxic.
[03:54:11.912 --> 03:54:32.344]  But they were able to pay off the American Medical Association, which is why you can go back to the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA, back to the issues in the 1950s and perhaps even in the 1960s, full-page ads that said doctors recommend camels or doctors smoke camels more than any other cigarette or something like that.
[03:54:32.344 --> 03:54:38.347]  Doctors recommend camels, cigarettes, because the AMA had been corrupted
[03:54:39.111 --> 03:54:46.936]  And infested, in a sense, by these same operatives who convinced doctors that smoking cigarettes was good for you.
[03:54:46.936 --> 03:54:53.921]  These are the same exact people who are now saying that eating glyphosate-contaminated food is good for you.
[03:54:53.921 --> 03:54:57.523]  And it's the same criminal operations it has been throughout history.
[03:54:57.523 --> 03:55:03.547]  So, isn't it fascinating that here we are, the independent media, we are uncovering this.
[03:55:03.547 --> 03:55:04.208]  I gotta tell you,
[03:55:04.870 --> 03:55:18.439]  These multi-billion dollar jury decisions against Bayer would never have been possible without the existence of InfoWars or Natural News or, you know, the Food Babes website or all these other websites out there that have been exposing this.
[03:55:18.439 --> 03:55:22.021]  Mercola.com and, you know, Jeffrey Smith, did I mention him?
[03:55:22.021 --> 03:55:23.682]  Even Organic Consumers Association.
[03:55:23.682 --> 03:55:25.283]  Many others over all the years.
[03:55:25.283 --> 03:55:25.543]  U.S.
[03:55:25.543 --> 03:55:26.944]  Right to Know.
[03:55:26.944 --> 03:55:29.446]  We changed the conversation.
[03:55:29.446 --> 03:55:30.907]  We educated the public.
[03:55:31.440 --> 03:55:52.506]  And that made us a threat in the minds of the evil operators inside Monsanto, and that's when they pulled the trigger, and I believe launched the actual death squads, the coercion campaigns, the intimidation, the bribery, defamation, smears, character assassination, professional assassination.
[03:55:52.506 --> 03:55:55.187]  They got scientists blacklisted from the entire industry of science.
[03:55:56.303 --> 03:55:59.164]  And it's the same tactic they used back in Big Tobacco.
[03:55:59.164 --> 03:56:03.566]  But understand, people, it's the independent media that exposed all of this.
[03:56:03.566 --> 03:56:07.787]  It's the independent media that made these massive jury decisions possible.
[03:56:07.787 --> 03:56:23.954]  It's the independent media, if you think about it, and all the activists, all the clean food activists, and all the people who believe in nutrition, and believe in supplements that help your health, and believe in avoiding the toxic hormone disruptors, and the pesticides, and the herbicides.
[03:56:23.954 --> 03:56:24.774]  It's all those people.
[03:56:25.362 --> 03:56:26.964]  That have made this difference.
[03:56:26.964 --> 03:56:40.338]  It's like humanity has now arisen to defeat evil in the form of Monsanto or Bayer or the deep state that opposes democracy and has tried to tear down our republic.
[03:56:40.338 --> 03:56:42.040]  Humanity is rising.
[03:56:42.040 --> 03:56:42.701]  That's my point.
[03:56:43.607 --> 03:56:58.193]  And you are watching right here in this broadcast on InfoWars.com, you are watching the tip of the spear in this war against evil, against Satanism, against destruction.

[03:57:09.278 --> 03:57:11.919]  That's what we stand for and we stand against all those
[03:57:12.543 --> 03:57:16.666]  Who are trying to destroy life and destroy truth and obfuscate the truth out there.
[03:57:16.666 --> 03:57:18.167]  We stand for you.
[03:57:18.167 --> 03:57:19.848]  We stand for humanity.

[03:58:19.237 --> 03:58:22.301]  But they said, look, when you do plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[03:58:22.301 --> 03:58:23.062]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[03:58:23.062 --> 03:58:23.823]  Well, you know what?
[03:58:23.823 --> 03:58:25.085]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[03:58:25.085 --> 03:58:27.087]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[03:58:27.087 --> 03:58:28.049]  We decided to change the name.
[03:58:28.049 --> 03:58:29.270]  So when you peel off the label...
[03:58:30.472 --> 03:58:34.176]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
