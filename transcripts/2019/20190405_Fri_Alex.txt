[00:00:06.863 --> 00:00:11.858]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:58.282]  Imagine a Stephen King novel, where all over the Western world, convicted pedophiles, child rapists and worse, disguise themselves as clowns.
[00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:05.145]  They then call themselves drag queens, and while disguised, openly are given admittance
[00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:15.346]  To elementary schools, nursery schools, public parks, where they then prey directly on children.
[00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:24.754]  Ladies and gentlemen, a group in Houston has busted their second convicted child rapist.
[00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:29.879]  Both men were convicted of raping six-year-old boys.
[00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:41.855]  They heavily hid their identities, used multiple aliases, but the group, Mass Resistance, was able to track them and find out their real identities.
[00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:43.095]  They're now tracking others.
[00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:46.317]  I will let you know we are doing it as well.
[00:01:46.317 --> 00:01:56.664]  Boots on the ground in New York, Texas, and other areas, and our findings are bone-chilling and are being delivered to law enforcement.
[00:01:56.664 --> 00:01:58.565]  Bone-chilling!
[00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:10.053]  And they are organized out of New York City, directed in England, Germany, France, Belgium, Sweden, Canada, the United States.
[00:02:10.053 --> 00:02:15.375]  They are commanded by convicted murderers.
[00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:19.677]  They are commanded by sinister individuals.
[00:02:19.677 --> 00:02:23.718]  You cannot make this up.
[00:02:23.718 --> 00:02:27.800]  And again, when you go to their Facebook and their Twitter pages, when they're together at a party, they just look like women.
[00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:36.592]  But when they go out, it's in full disguise.
[00:02:36.592 --> 00:02:40.834]  Bombshell, another Drag Queen Story Hour member exposed as pedophile.
[00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:45.315]  Investigation shows, you can see the live feed broadcast today.
[00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:56.759]  And it states that an international cult-like gang disguises itself as clowns and then feeds on children.
[00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.860]  This is not it, the clown.
[00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:02.355]  This is the real IT.
[00:03:02.355 --> 00:03:07.456]  And of course, IT feeds on the energy of children.
[00:03:07.456 --> 00:03:09.077]  On their innocence.
[00:03:09.077 --> 00:03:12.918]  It's the metaphor for the vampire.
[00:03:12.918 --> 00:03:20.800]  And so, you don't need to go to some distant star system to find some giant spider living under a city, feeding on thousands of children over the decades.
[00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:30.428]  All you have to do is look out your front door at your local public school that has been set up as a feeding nest.
[00:03:30.428 --> 00:03:44.259]  A feeding nest where the children are brought right in and handed over to child rapists.
[00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:47.722]  Another individual.
[00:03:47.722 --> 00:03:49.904]  His first and middle name, William Travis.
[00:03:49.904 --> 00:03:51.125]  Thank God he changed his name.
[00:03:54.597 --> 00:03:55.598]  So it's all coming up.
[00:03:55.598 --> 00:03:58.803]  I'm going to have one of the ladies spearheading, exposing these groups.
[00:03:58.803 --> 00:04:00.966]  They've done a lot of hard work.
[00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:03.329]  All of me in the second hour, we're going to get to all of this then.
[00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:14.759]  But you're definitely going to want to join us coming up today, because you haven't seen them in the demon outfits.
[00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:18.322]  That's what I'd requested to be on the back screen, but I'll just do it this way.
[00:04:18.322 --> 00:04:20.484]  Document cam shot, please.
[00:04:20.484 --> 00:04:26.089]  Bombshell, another drag queen story, our member exposed as pedophile investigation shows.
[00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:30.053]  And in almost all the photos, he's in dominatrix vampire outfits.
[00:04:32.345 --> 00:04:46.351]  And is walking around with his mouth open like a moray eel hissing at the children, going, ah, children, oh, with a rubber chicken in his hand, saying, come to me, my chickens, and then he hands them a flower.
[00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:51.293]  Of course, the chicken is the term for a young boy.
[00:04:51.293 --> 00:04:57.095]  Come to me, my chickens, says the convicted six-year-old rapist.
[00:05:00.558 --> 00:05:02.879]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:06:13.383 --> 00:06:15.105]  Another world.
[00:06:15.105 --> 00:06:15.886]  Another time.
[00:06:15.886 --> 00:06:20.151]  As life was green and good, until the crystal cracked.
[00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.372]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:33.372 --> 00:06:42.376]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:42.376 --> 00:06:44.998]  We're going toe-to-toe with the pedophile armies.
[00:06:44.998 --> 00:06:48.059]  Toe-to-toe with the Chi-Coms.
[00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:49.300]  Toe-to-toe with Big Tech.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.922]  Toe-to-toe with their command system, the Democratic Party.
[00:06:53.922 --> 00:06:54.202]  And now...
[00:06:56.133 --> 00:07:01.255]  Mainline Americans and others know we're fighting heartless, evil, anti-god globalists.
[00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:07.537]  Now the average American knows their operating system is a anti-human, vampiric system that wants to kill children before they're born.
[00:07:07.537 --> 00:07:12.759]  And if they can't do that, they want to drug them out of their minds and suck their soul while they're alive.
[00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:19.962]  People know the Democrats are a hardened group, a cult of power and wickedness.
[00:07:19.962 --> 00:07:23.944]  And their governors are openly on television saying we're going to kill babies after they're born.
[00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.053]  And the government and the courts aren't involved.
[00:07:27.053 --> 00:07:29.334]  Your children belong to us.
[00:07:29.334 --> 00:07:37.541]  And then facilities all over the United States, small children are brought before convicted child rapists dressed as clowns.
[00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:37.901]  That's right.
[00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:46.788]  Drag Queen Storytime is men disguising their identities, dressed as clowns, having their way with their children and grooming them in their own words.
[00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:50.098]  And now we're discovering why they're so heavily disguised.
[00:07:50.098 --> 00:07:52.002]  They look like clowns.
[00:07:52.002 --> 00:07:56.610]  They don't even look like drag queens because they're disguising themselves.
[00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.056]  And that's something actually done in the pedo culture going back at least to the 80s.
[00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:28.294]  Well, even before, is that men that would abuse children would dress as a clown, normally a vampiric clown to horrify them further, and also they would dress as, I guess they call it plushies, or as a stuffed animal or whatever to really horrify and screw up younger children.
[00:08:28.294 --> 00:08:29.795]  Furries.
[00:08:29.795 --> 00:08:30.155]  And so,
[00:08:31.613 --> 00:08:35.416]  You need to understand, folks, they mean business.
[00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:39.540]  And another one has been busted in Houston.
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.581]  So that's two out of the group.
[00:08:41.581 --> 00:08:43.483]  In fact, both have been convicted.
[00:08:43.483 --> 00:08:46.726]  Both ringleaders raped six-year-old boys.
[00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:47.626]  That's their convictions.
[00:08:47.626 --> 00:08:52.811]  You can read the rap sheet and everything at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:54.172]  That will be in the second hour.
[00:08:54.172 --> 00:08:57.655]  We have the ladies spearheading it with mass resistance is the name of the group.
[00:09:00.034 --> 00:09:04.859]  We have her joining us in the second hour.
[00:09:04.859 --> 00:09:07.722]  Profamilyactivismmassresistance.com.
[00:09:07.722 --> 00:09:12.427]  So they are going to be joining us coming up today.
[00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:19.954]  And I will get into all of it in an in-depth expose in the second hour, but this is literal gang of
[00:09:21.357 --> 00:09:38.467]  Sickos, many of them convicted pedophiles, working with governments around the United States and the world, given access in many cases without telling parents, to public schools, elementary schools, you name it, libraries, to target your children.
[00:09:38.467 --> 00:09:48.714]  And we have shocking video of the children being targeted and sitting on their laps and being given roses,
[00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:55.579]  Which is a sign, red roses, a sign of passion, a sign of wanting to obviously date someone.
[00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:57.560]  I'm going to have to explain that to folks.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:04.564]  And then saying you want to pet the chicken, want to touch the chicken, which is the term for young boy.
[00:10:04.564 --> 00:10:06.845]  That is a fact in the FBI manual.
[00:10:06.845 --> 00:10:13.269]  So I'm sorry we have to learn about all this stuff together, but our children are being hit and hit hard.
[00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:15.270]  And so that is coming up in the second hour.
[00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.031]  I'm going to stop there.
[00:10:17.558 --> 00:10:21.922]  And I will tell you, viewer discretion is advised in the second hour.
[00:10:21.922 --> 00:10:25.665]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[00:10:25.665 --> 00:10:29.307]  Because this is scarier than any Stephen King novel.
[00:10:29.307 --> 00:10:38.935]  This is the real group of men, many of them convicted pedophiles, dressed as clowns, giving access to your children.
[00:10:38.935 --> 00:10:40.977]  Even the local news, let's cue that back up next hour.
[00:10:42.261 --> 00:10:43.621]  Well, they were introducing it last year.
[00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:44.562]  Oh, it's so great.
[00:10:44.562 --> 00:10:46.522]  Some mean people don't like it.
[00:10:46.522 --> 00:10:48.563]  And it said the kids got scared and pulled away.
[00:10:48.563 --> 00:10:51.584]  But the anchor goes, but you got to get them while they're young.
[00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:54.084]  They'll learn.
[00:10:54.084 --> 00:10:56.405]  Like we're in some alternate.
[00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:57.245]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:10:57.245 --> 00:11:02.267]  Like we're in some alternate dimension.
[00:11:02.267 --> 00:11:05.267]  Hell, since you pulled it up so quick, let's go ahead and just play it for people.
[00:11:05.267 --> 00:11:06.488]  And I'll hit all the second hour.
[00:11:06.488 --> 00:11:06.788]  Here it is.
[00:11:08.018 --> 00:11:14.821]  The Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour called Drag Queen Story Time.
[00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:18.423]  Stephanie Whitfield sat in on the program designed to promote acceptance.
[00:11:19.483 --> 00:11:22.084]  Good morning everybody!
[00:11:22.084 --> 00:11:26.387]  The Heights Library had a special guest for story time.
[00:11:26.387 --> 00:11:27.387]  Oh my goodness.
[00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:28.748]  Everyone is dressed so nice.
[00:11:28.748 --> 00:11:31.189]  I wish I would have wore a nice costume for y'all.
[00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:35.191]  A visitor who usually performs for an older audience.
[00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:36.392]  My name is Blackberry.
[00:11:36.392 --> 00:11:38.053]  I'm a bearded drag queen.
[00:11:38.053 --> 00:11:40.574]  That means I'm a lady with lots of facial hair.
[00:11:40.574 --> 00:11:41.855]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[00:11:43.413 --> 00:11:46.856]  This program is geared towards kids 10 years old and younger.
[00:12:02.401 --> 00:12:06.424]  How about you go down to Mexico to a leper colony and see people with their faces melting off?
[00:12:06.424 --> 00:12:08.626]  You know, let them have something unexperienced.
[00:12:08.626 --> 00:12:17.474]  How about a 400-pound black guy with a huge beard saying, I'm a lady, to kids that are recoiling scared, saying, you want to touch my beard?
[00:12:17.474 --> 00:12:19.415]  And then the kids come and sit on their laps.
[00:12:19.415 --> 00:12:30.164]  And at this very event, not one, but two convicted child rapists operating with aliases, wearing disguises.
[00:12:31.274 --> 00:12:34.016]  You know how many banks have been robbed by people dressed like clowns?
[00:12:34.016 --> 00:12:35.077]  A lot.
[00:12:35.077 --> 00:12:37.278]  You know how many liquor stores?
[00:12:37.278 --> 00:12:40.861]  You know how many people have been tortured to death by men dressed like clowns?
[00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:45.464]  John Wayne Gacy, when they go further?
[00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:48.006]  These poor children.
[00:12:48.006 --> 00:12:51.168]  But this guy's not a convicted pedophile.
[00:12:51.168 --> 00:12:53.170]  Little Birdy's told me he's had his background run.
[00:12:55.057 --> 00:12:56.998]  No, it's the people that are there.
[00:12:56.998 --> 00:13:03.601]  But this is who they chose as the best example, because we're going to show you what actually happened at these events next hour.
[00:13:03.601 --> 00:13:08.863]  The kids sitting on the laps, getting petted, the chickens, all of it.
[00:13:08.863 --> 00:13:10.944]  You're going to see all of it next hour.
[00:13:10.944 --> 00:13:12.324]  This is America 2019.
[00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:19.947]  Now, we've got a huge overload of incredible news when we come back from break.
[00:13:19.947 --> 00:13:21.088]  I'm going to get to everything.
[00:13:22.506 --> 00:13:28.370]  Vatican Cardinal Warns West Will Disappear Because of Mass Migration.
[00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.772]  Rand Paul Blocking Release of Mueller Report to Fourth Investigation of Clinton Comey.

[00:13:51.767 --> 00:13:56.090]  MSM claims creepy Joe Biden meme shared by Trump doctored.
[00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.512]  No, it's called humor.
[00:13:58.512 --> 00:14:02.875]  Also, we're going to get into all the other big news.
[00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:06.718]  Video of migrants, that's illegal alien invaders, cutting through the barbed wire of the U.S.
[00:14:06.718 --> 00:14:07.779]  border.
[00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:10.881]  We've got Trump supposedly backing off the threat to close the border.
[00:14:10.881 --> 00:14:14.184]  That's not good news.
[00:14:14.184 --> 00:14:14.984]  It's all coming up.
[00:14:14.984 --> 00:14:16.625]  But please do not forget.
[00:14:17.669 --> 00:14:21.831]  I've got to end the specials any day now.
[00:14:21.831 --> 00:14:27.713]  They will be gone by Monday because I just haven't come up with the new specials yet, because this is such a huge special.

[00:14:57.664 --> 00:14:59.345]  All three of the fish oils are about to sell out.
[00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:01.627]  That's why I've got to end this mega special.
[00:15:01.627 --> 00:15:05.030]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is very close to selling out.

[00:15:20.025 --> 00:15:28.749]  We've got a very strong organically delivered formula of it that would be normally sold for $300, $400 because they put seven times markup on it.
[00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:31.091]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we have almost no markup on it when it's 60% off.
[00:15:32.071 --> 00:15:33.792]  So it's a good deal at a hundred and something dollars.
[00:15:33.792 --> 00:15:37.653]  It costs thousands of dollars a kilo just for the PQQ, the CoQ10, and the rest of it.

[00:15:42.455 --> 00:15:45.836]  It's as close to a fountain of youth that God's given us as anything out there.

[00:15:48.257 --> 00:15:51.799]  60% off, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:53.740]  Unprecedented.

[00:17:04.032 --> 00:17:09.095]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[00:17:09.095 --> 00:17:16.280]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.843]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[00:17:21.423 --> 00:17:25.066]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[00:17:25.066 --> 00:17:28.188]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[00:17:28.188 --> 00:17:30.830]  It hit me when I was arrested.

[00:18:00.222 --> 00:18:03.826]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.826 --> 00:18:05.609]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.609 --> 00:18:16.882]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.643 --> 00:18:26.710]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:37.379]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.879 --> 00:18:40.502]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.502 --> 00:18:42.223]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.223 --> 00:18:52.233]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.233 --> 00:18:54.875]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.875 --> 00:18:59.580]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.123 --> 00:19:08.526]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:19:08.526 --> 00:19:09.966]  Believe me, I know.
[00:19:09.966 --> 00:19:14.268]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:19:14.268 --> 00:19:17.749]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[00:19:18.229 --> 00:19:19.910]  I still have that energy.
[00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:40.086]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[00:19:40.566 --> 00:19:44.569]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[00:19:55.976 --> 00:19:57.317]  Supermail Vitality.
[00:19:57.317 --> 00:20:03.341]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:20:03.341 --> 00:20:06.003]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.877 --> 00:20:16.118]  You found it.
[00:20:16.118 --> 00:20:18.159]  The tip of the spear.
[00:20:18.159 --> 00:20:23.622]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:26.363]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[00:20:26.363 --> 00:20:29.745]  Say that joker to the thief.
[00:20:29.745 --> 00:20:31.906]  There's too much confusion.
[00:20:44.833 --> 00:20:53.160]  Okay, before we tackle the organized globalist invasion of the Europe and the U.S.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.523]  that even top Vatican cardinals are saying is a planned take down of the West.
[00:20:58.387 --> 00:21:00.828]  And that the Pope is basically wrong for what he's doing.
[00:21:00.828 --> 00:21:01.648]  This is getting wild.
[00:21:01.648 --> 00:21:03.468]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:21:03.468 --> 00:21:10.931]  Before we get to all the news I have about Muslims selling women into sex slavery all over the Middle East and Africa, it's actually expanding.
[00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:14.392]  And the left will never call it Islamic sex slavery, but that's what it is.
[00:21:14.392 --> 00:21:17.152]  We're going to be looking at that.
[00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:19.053]  I've got so much I want to get to, but first...
[00:21:20.037 --> 00:21:25.620]  Let's get into MSM, Kellan McBrain article from Infowars.com.
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:30.263]  MSM claims creepy Biden meme by Carpe Duncan.
[00:21:30.263 --> 00:21:33.525]  He's been one of our contest winners before, a big listener.
[00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:35.866]  Carpe Duncan gets tweeted all the time by the president.
[00:21:35.866 --> 00:21:42.230]  MSM claims creepy Biden meme shared by Trump doctored.
[00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.551]  And Biden tweeted
[00:21:44.986 --> 00:21:50.268]  Of course, that yes, this is very presidential by the president faking this video.
[00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:53.389]  No, it'd be fake if it was meant to fool somebody.
[00:21:53.389 --> 00:22:01.113]  It's ridiculously like a stick figure coming up behind him, like something you'd see on Saturday Night Live if they were still funny.
[00:22:01.113 --> 00:22:12.797]  And so it's got Biden making his excuses for his bizarre behavior while another Biden pops up behind him and comes over and then begins smelling his hair and rubbing on him.
[00:22:12.797 --> 00:22:14.058]  It's hilarious.
[00:22:15.014 --> 00:22:21.202]  And then I love how the left acts like that, oh, Trump got caught lying again, PolitiFact.
[00:22:21.202 --> 00:22:24.426]  That actually wasn't Biden doing that.
[00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:25.548]  It was fake.
[00:22:25.548 --> 00:22:30.935]  Trump appeared to be trying to mislead the public that Biden had groped Biden.
[00:22:32.912 --> 00:22:39.894]  You know, they've actually done stuff like that before, when Trump said, wow, look at this, we've got hamburgers a mile high!
[00:22:39.894 --> 00:22:43.876]  When he bought all those hamburgers for the football teams at the White House, it was a government shutdown.
[00:22:43.876 --> 00:22:50.878]  And they actually had the fact-checking sites, breathlessly, actually the hamburgers weren't a mile high, there were probably 500 hamburgers.
[00:22:50.878 --> 00:22:56.300]  And if you stacked the hamburgers on top of each other, each hamburger being two inches tall, it would only be so many feet tall.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.380]  So the president is wrong, the hamburgers are not 500, you know,
[00:23:07.063 --> 00:23:08.264]  Let's roll it with audio.
[00:23:08.264 --> 00:23:11.828]  Radio listeners, obviously, go to Infowars.com to see the funny video.
[00:23:11.828 --> 00:23:17.793]  It's got 17 million plus views on Twitter alone, even more on Facebook.
[00:23:17.793 --> 00:23:21.237]  It's massive on YouTube, and it's just funny.
[00:23:21.237 --> 00:23:25.260]  But see, the Democrats can't take somebody making fun of them.
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:29.224]  They have to make it up and say that it's a fake video.
[00:23:29.224 --> 00:23:30.225]  Welcome back, Joe.
[00:23:30.225 --> 00:23:32.007]  Here's what the president tweeted.
[00:23:33.696 --> 00:23:38.800]  I shake hands, I hug people, I grab men and move them by the shoulders and say, you can do this.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:44.385]  Whether they're women, men, young, old, it's the way I've always been.
[00:23:44.385 --> 00:23:48.548]  It's the way I've tried to show I care about them and I listen.
[00:23:48.548 --> 00:24:00.218]  So, remember what happened a few months ago when Jim Acosta wouldn't shut up, asked five questions, they send over the moderator lady that's trying to get the mic away.
[00:24:02.264 --> 00:24:04.785]  The President tweeted a doctored video.
[00:24:31.974 --> 00:24:40.099]  And the next morning the frontman said, I've watched it, they zoomed in, it's not a doctored video, they zoomed in.
[00:24:40.099 --> 00:24:41.640]  So that's all that's happening here.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:48.464]  You zoom in on a video so it's closer, you've doctored it, even though we changed nothing.
[00:24:48.464 --> 00:24:51.046]  You show a joke video, they say it's doctored.
[00:24:51.046 --> 00:24:52.707]  These people are totally deceptive.
[00:24:55.706 --> 00:24:57.007]  Nobody manipulated it.
[00:24:57.007 --> 00:24:58.188]  Give me a break.
[00:24:58.188 --> 00:25:00.190]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.851]  All that is is a close-up.
[00:25:01.851 --> 00:25:05.253]  See, that's just dishonest reporting.
[00:25:05.253 --> 00:25:05.994]  I watched that.
[00:25:05.994 --> 00:25:07.375]  I heard that last night.
[00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:08.656]  They made it close-up.
[00:25:08.656 --> 00:25:10.217]  They showed it close-up.
[00:25:10.217 --> 00:25:12.219]  And he was not nice to that young woman.
[00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:13.180]  I don't hold him for that.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.103]  Because it wasn't overly, you know, horrible.
[00:25:17.103 --> 00:25:20.786]  But all that was, when you say doctor, you're a dishonest guy.
[00:25:20.786 --> 00:25:22.347]  Because it wasn't doctored.
[00:25:22.347 --> 00:25:24.008]  They gave a close-up view.
[00:25:24.008 --> 00:25:27.451]  That's not doctoring.
[00:25:27.451 --> 00:25:29.693]  That's not doctoring.
[00:25:29.693 --> 00:25:36.518]  What's doctoring is on CNN not showing the video.
[00:25:36.518 --> 00:25:37.819]  We've got that clip.
[00:25:37.819 --> 00:25:42.283]  And saying they aired a doctored video that showed Biden roping someone.
[00:25:43.482 --> 00:25:45.343]  No, it's a joke video.
[00:25:45.343 --> 00:25:50.107]  A five-year-old, a two-year-old, a three-year-old would know it was a joke.
[00:25:50.107 --> 00:25:53.550]  But that's the level of the deception these people are engaged in.
[00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:59.714]  That's why I wanted to lead this segment with that.
[00:25:59.714 --> 00:26:03.197]  It's because he's saying, oh, the president's not being presidential.
[00:26:03.197 --> 00:26:06.199]  Let me tell you what's not presidential is selling our sovereignty out.
[00:26:06.199 --> 00:26:12.004]  What's not presidential is being part of a party that says America was never that great, it'll never be great.
[00:26:13.706 --> 00:26:16.829]  It's you guys that are the embarrassment.
[00:26:16.829 --> 00:26:18.430]  It's you guys that are the problem.
[00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:27.458]  It's you guys that belong to the bullies all over the country trying to get people fired because they're wearing a mega hat at a coffee shop.
[00:26:27.458 --> 00:26:32.302]  And then, of course, that lady that did that, the old Jewish man in Palo Alto, California, she got fired.
[00:26:32.302 --> 00:26:33.944]  That article's up on Infowars.com.
[00:26:33.944 --> 00:26:37.507]  A woman who harassed an old man in Starbucks over a mega hat.
[00:26:38.871 --> 00:26:42.792]  Gets fired, left to scream at 74-year-old Jewish Trump supporter is a Nazi.
[00:26:42.792 --> 00:26:45.633]  She said, we're coming to your house, we're going to get you, Nazi.
[00:26:45.633 --> 00:26:48.214]  We're going to find out where you work, you're going to get fired.
[00:26:48.214 --> 00:26:51.215]  And her boss from a guitar shop said, we're firing her.
[00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:54.015]  We don't like stalking and harassing people.
[00:26:54.015 --> 00:26:58.196]  We're trying to unify folks, and this is still America.
[00:26:58.196 --> 00:27:01.377]  So the old Jewish man said, you know, this is still America.
[00:27:01.377 --> 00:27:03.178]  And I want to get him on as a guest, by the way, if we can.
[00:27:04.434 --> 00:27:07.597]  And the fact that it's an act of defiance to wear one out in public.
[00:27:07.597 --> 00:27:09.639]  And sure, most of the time you get support.
[00:27:09.639 --> 00:27:10.700]  Or you get ignored.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.462]  But let me tell you something.
[00:27:12.462 --> 00:27:17.806]  Wearing a Make America Great Again hat is like being Alex Jones in a leftist area.
[00:27:17.806 --> 00:27:23.292]  And just get ready because you just need to not sit with your back to the crowd.
[00:27:24.332 --> 00:27:26.353]  Now when I go to a restaurant, they say, where would you like to sit?
[00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:29.134]  And if it's in the leftist area, I say, listen, I need to be in a corner.
[00:27:29.134 --> 00:27:31.835]  And then I sit facing out.
[00:27:31.835 --> 00:27:33.895]  Because it also entices the left.
[00:27:33.895 --> 00:27:35.156]  Remember, they're cowards.
[00:27:35.156 --> 00:27:36.636]  Instinctively.
[00:27:36.636 --> 00:27:38.957]  So they see one old man alone, they're going to try to gang up.
[00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:41.598]  And she tried to get people to gang up on him, but they refused.
[00:27:41.598 --> 00:27:51.862]  But if you've got your back turned, that's every time they've walked over and knocked my drink over, slapped me in the back of the head, said we're going to kill you, said we're going to get you, said we're going to attack you.
[00:27:51.862 --> 00:27:52.362]  Every time.
[00:27:54.352 --> 00:27:55.813]  I had my back to him.
[00:27:55.813 --> 00:28:12.559]  I was in a hot tub in Hawaii last year, a family vacation, just at the hotel, and this guy had been giving me dirty looks earlier over at the bar, by the hot tub, and all of a sudden, he like walks by and like, my arm's out on the edge, he steps on my finger a little bit, goes, oh sorry!
[00:28:12.559 --> 00:28:15.900]  I go, it's okay, and he goes, yeah, yeah, right!
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.461]  You're gonna be sorry!
[00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:19.702]  And he was sitting there glaring at me, and the guy wasn't even that big.
[00:28:20.655 --> 00:28:24.479]  I was like, dude, I was just like, hey, man, whatever, you're such a great American.
[00:28:24.479 --> 00:28:26.200]  And then he goes, hey, look, it's Alex Jones.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.221]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:28:27.221 --> 00:28:29.283]  Don't mind if I get in the hot tub with you, do you?
[00:28:29.283 --> 00:28:33.207]  And my wife and kids were off doing something else.
[00:28:33.207 --> 00:28:34.128]  And I just said, you know what?
[00:28:35.345 --> 00:28:37.687]  I'm gonna let this skate, have a great day, buddy.
[00:28:37.687 --> 00:28:41.629]  And then I got out and left, and then his friends came over and said, man, don't do that, we're gonna throw him out of the hotel.
[00:28:41.629 --> 00:28:43.670]  I saw him getting on to him.
[00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:48.033]  By the way, the folks that attacked me at the chicken place, they all got banned from life from there, and they got thrown out.
[00:28:48.033 --> 00:28:48.734]  I left.
[00:28:48.734 --> 00:28:50.495]  I didn't get thrown out like the media says.
[00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:52.356]  But again, that's what corporate media has hated.
[00:28:52.356 --> 00:28:57.460]  They lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
[00:28:59.624 --> 00:29:01.945]  Ew, get the stinky dog away from me.
[00:29:01.945 --> 00:29:03.446]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[00:29:03.446 --> 00:29:04.746]  PD stopped eating.
[00:29:04.746 --> 00:29:05.987]  All of his hair fell out.
[00:29:05.987 --> 00:29:08.148]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[00:29:08.148 --> 00:29:09.869]  At least $5,000 in that bill.
[00:29:09.869 --> 00:29:12.430]  Creams, antibiotics, sprays.
[00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:13.350]  No results.
[00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.851]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynavite.
[00:29:15.851 --> 00:29:18.753]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E dot com.
[00:29:18.753 --> 00:29:19.613]  If you want the dog to be healthy,
[00:29:19.853 --> 00:29:21.134]  You gotta feed it something healthy.
[00:29:21.134 --> 00:29:22.916]  The omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:29:22.916 --> 00:29:28.901]  Flaxseed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dog food.
[00:29:28.901 --> 00:29:31.082]  Dynavite is nutrition.
[00:29:31.082 --> 00:29:32.864]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.
[00:29:32.864 --> 00:29:38.489]  Her coat is not soft, it's silky, it's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[00:29:38.489 --> 00:29:40.050]  She's got life, she's got energy.
[00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.051]  Tons of energy, no more bad smell.
[00:29:42.051 --> 00:29:43.413]  Dynavite's the bomb.
[00:29:43.413 --> 00:29:48.377]  Dynavite is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs, you know, besides me, of course.
[00:29:48.797 --> 00:29:48.877]  859-428-1000.
[00:29:48.877 --> 00:29:49.037]  859-428-1000.
[00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:49.878]  Dynavite for life.
[00:29:49.878 --> 00:29:50.879]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E dot com.
[00:30:01.434 --> 00:30:02.855]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:30:02.855 --> 00:30:04.757]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:30:04.757 --> 00:30:05.358]  It is.
[00:30:05.358 --> 00:30:10.242]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:30:10.242 --> 00:30:11.583]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:30:11.583 --> 00:30:13.405]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:30:13.405 --> 00:30:15.887]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:30:15.887 --> 00:30:17.529]  Brain, body, heart.
[00:30:17.529 --> 00:30:18.970]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:20.351]  You've got the children's.
[00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:21.472]  You've got the adults.
[00:30:21.472 --> 00:30:22.453]  You've got the krill oil.
[00:30:22.453 --> 00:30:24.735]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's,
[00:30:24.795 --> 00:30:26.656]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:30:51.684 --> 00:30:57.711]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:30:57.711 --> 00:30:58.412]  I just can't do it!
[00:31:00.469 --> 00:31:06.190]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[00:33:03.367 --> 00:33:05.988]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.889 --> 00:33:26.712]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:33:26.712 --> 00:33:29.273]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.273 --> 00:33:39.818]  Bottom's on up and it screws the watch.
[00:33:39.818 --> 00:33:43.560]  You can go before the time.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:47.743]  You can head your bet, hold it clean.
[00:33:59.507 --> 00:34:00.807]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:00.807 --> 00:34:07.431]  We are broadcasting worldwide on this Friday, April 5th, 2019 transmission.
[00:34:07.431 --> 00:34:13.254]  And we are about to blow the international pedophile ring wide open.
[00:34:13.254 --> 00:34:17.036]  If that doesn't get the globalists shooting at me, nothing will.
[00:34:17.036 --> 00:34:18.117]  That's the name of the game.
[00:34:18.117 --> 00:34:19.698]  Press the attack.
[00:34:19.698 --> 00:34:23.019]  Never back down.
[00:34:23.019 --> 00:34:23.560]  That's right.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.902]  You globalists want to attack me and say you're not running pedophile rings?
[00:34:26.902 --> 00:34:27.082]  Well,
[00:34:27.915 --> 00:34:29.416]  Get ready.
[00:34:29.416 --> 00:34:33.940]  Because a lot of it's coming out, and you can't stop humanity.
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:40.044]  And you can't stop the citizen investigators that are going to destroy your operations.
[00:34:40.044 --> 00:34:41.625]  You want to fight?
[00:34:41.625 --> 00:34:44.788]  You better believe you got one, scumbags.
[00:34:44.788 --> 00:34:46.729]  You can run, but you can't hide.
[00:34:46.729 --> 00:34:48.871]  And we're coming.
[00:34:48.871 --> 00:34:51.913]  That animating collision.
[00:34:51.913 --> 00:34:54.375]  That date with destiny.
[00:34:54.375 --> 00:34:56.457]  Just when you figure out we're not playing chicken.
[00:34:57.517 --> 00:35:01.959]  We want to bang heads with you.
[00:35:01.959 --> 00:35:05.740]  We want to collide at full speed into you.
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.321]  We want to destroy you.
[00:35:08.321 --> 00:35:18.205]  I love that line from Goldfinger where Sean Connery's trapped and he says, do you expect me to talk?
[00:35:18.205 --> 00:35:23.947]  And Goldfinger says, no, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[00:35:23.947 --> 00:35:23.987]  So.
[00:35:28.908 --> 00:35:36.052]  You globalists get on the side of the mojo where you get to kill the unborn babies and kill them after they're born and brainwash our kids and poison them.
[00:35:36.052 --> 00:35:42.216]  It's all coming back on you a thousand fold.
[00:35:42.216 --> 00:35:47.700]  You know, vengeance is God's.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.941]  Vengeance is God's.
[00:35:49.941 --> 00:35:54.764]  But God has instruments of vengeance.
[00:35:54.764 --> 00:35:56.245]  That's always the twist to the riddle.
[00:35:58.717 --> 00:36:02.399]  And so the globalists expect to try to terrorize us.
[00:36:02.399 --> 00:36:06.501]  We're not one of these poor kids who got strung up in one of your dungeons.
[00:36:06.501 --> 00:36:11.503]  We're going to terrorize you.
[00:36:11.503 --> 00:36:18.446]  Because you deserve what you've done to these children to be done to you.
[00:36:18.446 --> 00:36:21.647]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:36:21.647 --> 00:36:23.148]  But we're hunting you.
[00:36:23.148 --> 00:36:24.188]  You're not hunting us.
[00:36:24.188 --> 00:36:25.209]  We're coming for you.
[00:36:27.688 --> 00:36:30.951]  We're looking for you.
[00:36:30.951 --> 00:36:32.592]  We're hunting you.
[00:36:32.592 --> 00:36:33.533]  We're seeking you.
[00:36:33.533 --> 00:36:38.897]  I think you figured that out now, haven't you?
[00:36:38.897 --> 00:36:40.258]  All your threats and all your crap.
[00:36:57.401 --> 00:37:00.143]  You're gonna pay for what you've done to the children.
[00:37:00.143 --> 00:37:15.831]  Just like our God, our King, our Master, our Director, Jesus Christ said, it's better for you to hurt one of these children than to tie a big-ass millstone around your neck and throw yourself in the deepest part of the ocean.
[00:37:15.831 --> 00:37:18.773]  But I'm digressing, I have a lot of other news to hit, and I'm getting angry.
[00:37:20.677 --> 00:37:23.220]  And they're about to arrest Assange, which is a big screw-up.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.402]  The guy's a hero.
[00:37:24.402 --> 00:37:25.583]  He helped get Trump elected.
[00:37:25.583 --> 00:37:28.607]  And this is a real betrayal if Trump lets this happen.
[00:37:28.607 --> 00:37:32.932]  Maybe Trump's got some plan to get him back here and then get the charges dropped or whatever.
[00:37:32.932 --> 00:37:34.915]  But he didn't release stuff that hurt the United States.
[00:37:34.915 --> 00:37:39.441]  He released stuff that exposed the criminal deep state that's out of control working with the chi-coms and others.
[00:37:40.811 --> 00:37:56.200]  And breaking a high-level source within the Ecuadorian state has told Wikileaks, this is from the Wikileaks Twitter, that Julian Assange will be expelled within hours to days using the hashtag INA Papers.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:05.245]  Offshore scandal as a pretext that it already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest.
[00:38:05.245 --> 00:38:07.206]  And then I guess he'll be taken to the United States.
[00:38:08.871 --> 00:38:26.604]  That will be a gigantic black mark on Trump if Julian Assange is not exonerated because the President said, I don't care who's got the files.
[00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:27.645]  I don't care if it's WikiLeaks.
[00:38:27.645 --> 00:38:28.605]  I don't care if it's the Russians.
[00:38:28.605 --> 00:38:29.946]  I don't care who it is.
[00:38:29.946 --> 00:38:31.607]  Release him.
[00:38:31.607 --> 00:38:34.369]  Well, guess what, Mr. President?
[00:38:34.369 --> 00:38:36.731]  He did what you told him to do.
[00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:37.832]  So don't hang him out to dry.
[00:38:43.763 --> 00:38:46.604]  It's that simple.
[00:38:46.604 --> 00:38:49.064]  You can't do it.
[00:38:49.064 --> 00:38:54.886]  Now, I've seen some of Trump's lawyers arguing in court that Assange did nothing wrong in other cases.
[00:38:54.886 --> 00:38:58.967]  And I think Trump has a way of making it look one way and then another thing happens.
[00:38:58.967 --> 00:39:02.368]  And he tends to take care of people that have done the right thing and have been loyal.
[00:39:05.191 --> 00:39:07.073]  I get what the intelligence agencies are telling Trump.
[00:39:07.073 --> 00:39:10.856]  If you do this, everybody will start leaking, and then our national security's shot.
[00:39:10.856 --> 00:39:16.440]  It doesn't matter if the guy meant well, he's got to be burned, at least for a few years in prison.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.743]  They didn't release stuff that hurt the national security.
[00:39:19.743 --> 00:39:29.491]  Everything WikiLeaks has done is stuff that whistleblowers gave them that needed to come out, and the whistleblower capacity under Obama was being crapped on.
[00:39:29.491 --> 00:39:34.495]  They were persecuting the press and whistleblowers at a level more than all presidents combined.
[00:39:35.922 --> 00:39:39.825]  Even liberal law professors like Jonathan Turley would state that.
[00:39:39.825 --> 00:39:43.427]  And so Assange was a necessary counterbalance to that.
[00:39:43.427 --> 00:39:54.115]  I mean, I agree, we don't want to release the blueprints of space planes, or particle beams, or US assets inside China or the Europe.
[00:39:54.115 --> 00:39:56.477]  Interpol is infiltrated by CHICOMS.
[00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:59.539]  They just arrested the head of it.
[00:39:59.539 --> 00:40:00.980]  You've got all this stuff going on.
[00:40:02.219 --> 00:40:04.701]  And you've got the Office of Personnel Management hack.
[00:40:04.701 --> 00:40:08.384]  Every agent and their assets name and where they live and everything.
[00:40:08.384 --> 00:40:10.206]  So I don't want to hear it.
[00:40:10.206 --> 00:40:13.388]  Obama made a deal with China and transferred that to them.
[00:40:13.388 --> 00:40:19.374]  And we wouldn't have any chance of saving this country right now if Assange and others hadn't been conduits for the patriots in our government.
[00:40:19.374 --> 00:40:20.835]  It wasn't the Russians leaked the stuff.
[00:40:22.122 --> 00:40:23.423]  Okay?
[00:40:23.423 --> 00:40:30.528]  It was people associated with Blackwater-type companies, and it was people inside the agencies, people like Snowden.
[00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:31.709]  It was not the Russians.
[00:40:32.699 --> 00:40:49.433]  Okay, the Russians have got fast rockets and people that'll fight and all the rest of it and a lot of resources, but we run circles around the Russians when it comes to all the technology and the intercepts and just all of it.
[00:40:49.433 --> 00:40:55.778]  And the Russians are the scapegoat to say, oh, we can't release people that have done whizzy-lease because they're Russian agents.
[00:40:55.778 --> 00:40:56.679]  It's BS!
[00:40:57.981 --> 00:41:00.963]  Julian Assange isn't a Russian agent any more than I am.
[00:41:00.963 --> 00:41:13.570]  It's just a made-up thing they throw out there so Senator Blumenthal and Senator Murphy run their little cabal up there in Connecticut can point their finger at people and say, oh Alex Jones, he should be off the air.
[00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:16.031]  You know, he's a Russian asset.
[00:41:16.031 --> 00:41:20.114]  No, I'm an American and you're scumbags.
[00:41:20.114 --> 00:41:24.436]  All right, I didn't get to the Cardinal warns West will disappear because of mass migration.
[00:41:24.436 --> 00:41:25.237]  I've got to get to that.
[00:41:26.354 --> 00:41:28.955]  And a lot of other really key things dealing with the Mueller Report.
[00:41:28.955 --> 00:41:29.916]  I agree with Rand Paul.
[00:41:29.916 --> 00:41:34.458]  Don't release that until we get all the dirt on Clinton, Comey, and Brennan.
[00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:37.659]  Don't give us... Oh, release the report when all these other reports are suppressed.
[00:41:37.659 --> 00:41:38.300]  Release it all.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.921]  How about that?
[00:41:40.921 --> 00:41:42.822]  Put the shoe on the other foot.
[00:41:42.822 --> 00:41:48.064]  Nothing to hide in the stupid Mueller Report, but the point is you want everything released, don't release all the stuff on you.
[00:41:48.064 --> 00:41:51.145]  So that's all coming up as well.
[00:41:51.145 --> 00:41:54.327]  And then I've got Beto, Beto,
[00:41:56.525 --> 00:42:00.307]  Saying, oh yes, all white people must pay reparations to black people.
[00:42:00.307 --> 00:42:02.187]  And I mean, that is such a fraud on its face.
[00:42:02.187 --> 00:42:07.069]  Most white people, ancestors, came here after the Civil War.
[00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:10.431]  And then, most people lived in the North in the Civil War.
[00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:13.852]  There was three times the population in the North, so they weren't involved in slavery.
[00:42:15.621 --> 00:42:21.683]  So about 70% of people that live here came after the Civil War, after 1866, 1867.
[00:42:21.683 --> 00:42:26.245]  So that's almost 70%.
[00:42:26.245 --> 00:42:34.528]  Then, more than two-thirds lived in the North and that had nothing to do with slavery.
[00:42:34.528 --> 00:42:36.449]  And then of the South, 2% had slaves.
[00:42:36.449 --> 00:42:44.092]  So we're talking about a tiny group of white people whose descendants would be connected to slavery.
[00:42:45.566 --> 00:42:48.107]  I mean, my friend just had another great baby boy the other day.
[00:42:48.107 --> 00:42:55.792]  I was looking at photos and I was thinking, Beto is saying this newborn baby is guilty and has to pay black people money.
[00:42:55.792 --> 00:42:57.453]  That is so sick and evil!
[00:42:59.414 --> 00:43:02.676]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[00:43:02.676 --> 00:43:05.678]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[00:43:05.678 --> 00:43:12.543]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[00:43:12.543 --> 00:43:13.684]  X2 is back.
[00:43:13.684 --> 00:43:14.484]  We got it.
[00:43:14.484 --> 00:43:16.145]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[00:43:16.145 --> 00:43:17.746]  We rushed it into production.
[00:43:17.746 --> 00:43:18.507]  It's been bottled.
[00:43:18.507 --> 00:43:20.508]  The labels are being put on today.
[00:43:20.508 --> 00:43:24.271]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the
[00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:24.711]  We're good
[00:43:41.776 --> 00:43:48.418]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:43:48.418 --> 00:43:48.598]  It's you!
[00:44:08.257 --> 00:44:10.438]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:44:10.438 --> 00:44:19.144]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:44:19.144 --> 00:44:23.727]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.

[00:44:25.188 --> 00:44:28.710]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever

[00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.212]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:44.733 --> 00:47:50.900]  Broadcasting live, coming to you from Austin, Texas, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.123]  All right, let me do this.
[00:47:54.123 --> 00:48:00.930]  I tend to see articles all the time in the news, and then I've got to dig into them, because I know they're covering up that it's Islamic.
[00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:01.631]  And I saw several
[00:48:03.306 --> 00:48:06.908]  Examples of that just in the stacks of news that the crew printed for me.
[00:48:06.908 --> 00:48:24.778]  Because I surf around and look at everybody's Twitter and check all the mainstream corporate sites and then check DrudgeReport.com and I check InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and some of the other sites out there like Summit.News that Paul's launched that's excellent.
[00:48:24.778 --> 00:48:26.319]  That's a whole other issue, I'll tell you about that in a minute.
[00:48:29.918 --> 00:48:44.128]  I just always hear in the West how bad men are, how bad Western men are, how virtuous men from other countries are, from Africa and India and the Middle East and Asia, and just how bad the West is.
[00:48:44.128 --> 00:48:46.429]  Well, you see it and hear it everywhere.
[00:48:46.429 --> 00:48:53.274]  And anyone that has any cursory knowledge or history knows that that's completely upside down world.
[00:48:53.274 --> 00:48:58.798]  But I saw articles about how Facebook is being used all over, from Libya
[00:49:00.017 --> 00:49:08.765]  to Nigeria to traffic women into sex slavery and child brides.
[00:49:08.765 --> 00:49:10.987]  And of course, that's the Islamic culture.
[00:49:10.987 --> 00:49:13.269]  That's the Orthodox culture.
[00:49:13.269 --> 00:49:20.916]  Muhammad was there in Medina and Mecca, the crossroads of the caravans, where there was sex slavery and people sold into slavery.
[00:49:20.916 --> 00:49:21.837]  And that's what he did.
[00:49:21.837 --> 00:49:23.539]  He married, you know, his nine-year-old cousin.
[00:49:25.359 --> 00:49:28.701]  And so we all get shocked in Germany and England and the U.S.
[00:49:28.701 --> 00:49:36.866]  with the sexual immunization of little girls, where the dad takes his six-year-old and uses a pair of scissors to cut her female genitals off.
[00:49:36.866 --> 00:49:42.169]  And the left just fights to cover that up.
[00:49:42.169 --> 00:49:47.753]  And so now Facebook's been sued for reportedly enabling human trafficking.
[00:49:47.753 --> 00:49:50.795]  AP's reporting that as well.
[00:49:50.795 --> 00:49:52.676]  So, pull back from that.
[00:49:52.676 --> 00:49:54.177]  You read these whole articles.
[00:49:55.563 --> 00:49:58.886]  And it'll never say Muslims.
[00:49:58.886 --> 00:50:19.602]  Can you imagine a country that was 99% Christian, like Libya is Muslim, and then sex slavery comes back when Gaddafi's thrown out, and this is all going on, and then you never say it's Islam.
[00:50:19.602 --> 00:50:21.044]  Everybody's heard of a harem.
[00:50:21.044 --> 00:50:22.305]  What do you think a harem is?
[00:50:23.604 --> 00:50:36.315]  It's a big walled cage inside a sultan's palace, where he's got a bunch of women he bought he has sex with, and he's got maybe 50, 60, 70 kids.
[00:50:36.315 --> 00:50:47.464]  And then he'll choose out of any of them that he might want to make one a general, or he might want to execute one, or he might want to sell a bunch of them, he doesn't like them as slaves.
[00:50:47.464 --> 00:50:49.086]  He's got a farm of women.
[00:50:54.261 --> 00:50:57.523]  That's Islam.
[00:50:57.523 --> 00:51:02.686]  Like the Islamic, you know, television shows how to beat your wife.
[00:51:02.686 --> 00:51:11.032]  And all I'm saying is, why do I have to hear how I'm bad because I'm a white western man and how much I suck?
[00:51:11.032 --> 00:51:15.695]  When we're the regions of the world that stopped this crap and think it's wrong.
[00:51:15.695 --> 00:51:20.738]  And then a bunch of weird, crazy, leftist, America-hating, slack-jawed, mainly white women
[00:51:23.143 --> 00:51:23.683]  Freak out.
[00:51:23.683 --> 00:51:24.984]  Paul Watson wrote about it yesterday.
[00:51:24.984 --> 00:51:25.885]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:51:25.885 --> 00:51:26.645]  You guys pull it up.
[00:51:26.645 --> 00:51:28.926]  I forgot to cover it.
[00:51:28.926 --> 00:51:37.051]  This sociologist that's in women's empowerment studies, university professor, she saw a men working sign.
[00:51:37.051 --> 00:51:38.712]  Just some old 30-year-old sign.
[00:51:38.712 --> 00:51:41.874]  They're down in the sewer fixing it.
[00:51:41.874 --> 00:51:44.656]  How many women apply for that job?
[00:51:44.656 --> 00:51:45.716]  Paul tweets that.
[00:51:45.716 --> 00:51:47.818]  Let's pull Paul's Twitter up.
[00:51:47.818 --> 00:51:51.260]  And she stops and takes a photo of herself
[00:51:52.383 --> 00:51:54.864]  With the sign is so upset by how it triggered her.
[00:51:54.864 --> 00:52:00.965]  Meanwhile, she doesn't say a word about sex slavery in the Middle East.
[00:52:00.965 --> 00:52:05.866]  She doesn't say a word about any of that anywhere.
[00:52:05.866 --> 00:52:11.188]  Did you use a search engine professor triggered by men working sign?
[00:52:11.188 --> 00:52:12.128]  And there it is.
[00:52:12.128 --> 00:52:20.270]  And if you scroll down, people put out that the joke tweets are extremely voluminous, showing, showing, you know,
[00:52:25.169 --> 00:52:30.631]  How dare you work on that electrical pole?
[00:52:30.631 --> 00:52:32.331]  How dare you work in that combat zone?
[00:52:32.331 --> 00:52:39.933]  How dare you work at a thousand feet under as an industrial welder, the most dangerous job there is, underwater welder?
[00:52:39.933 --> 00:52:40.873]  How dare you do all this?
[00:52:40.873 --> 00:52:42.573]  You're such a bad man.
[00:52:42.573 --> 00:52:47.835]  Sociology professor offended by men working sign gets owned on Twitter.
[00:52:47.835 --> 00:52:48.875]  And then you go to the tweets below.
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.921]  So again, just think about that.
[00:52:52.921 --> 00:52:56.503]  You've got mass slavery going on.
[00:52:56.503 --> 00:52:57.604]  Stacks of news.
[00:52:57.604 --> 00:53:01.486]  I remember Colbert, like two years ago, made fun of me.
[00:53:01.486 --> 00:53:06.209]  And I said, Hillary doesn't say a word about women's rights in Libya she helped destroy.
[00:53:06.209 --> 00:53:11.272]  They're selling women on slave blocks in Tripoli and Benghazi every day.
[00:53:11.272 --> 00:53:12.312]  And I made the joke.
[00:53:12.312 --> 00:53:15.734]  Ho ho ho!
[00:53:15.734 --> 00:53:17.215]  What's a slave block?
[00:53:21.084 --> 00:53:25.265]  What's a slave block?
[00:53:25.265 --> 00:53:29.887]  Well, that's the classic term going back thousands of years ago where you've got an auction block.
[00:53:29.887 --> 00:53:31.508]  Forget the term auction block.
[00:53:31.508 --> 00:53:35.069]  It's a raised stage where the goods are shown.
[00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:40.371]  And the term auction block comes from slavery in biblical times in Egypt.
[00:53:40.371 --> 00:53:43.312]  It was called the auction block.
[00:53:43.312 --> 00:53:43.972]  Things don't change.
[00:53:49.292 --> 00:53:51.793]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:51.793 --> 00:53:58.196]  The one refuge men have got is hard, dangerous jobs, pouring concrete, digging holes, running jackhammers.
[00:53:58.196 --> 00:53:59.517]  Let me tell you something.
[00:53:59.517 --> 00:54:02.598]  I've done some construction work.
[00:54:02.598 --> 00:54:07.200]  Because my dad and mom wanted me to have different jobs, obviously, during high school and some of college.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.841]  And I went out and tried my hand.
[00:54:08.841 --> 00:54:10.241]  I'm like, I can get $25 an hour.
[00:54:11.914 --> 00:54:13.435]  In construction?
[00:54:13.435 --> 00:54:14.215]  Uh, yeah.
[00:54:14.215 --> 00:54:15.035]  Well, you're a big guy.
[00:54:15.035 --> 00:54:17.836]  Can you run this jackhammer for 12 hours?
[00:54:17.836 --> 00:54:19.657]  And I had just... I lift weights.
[00:54:19.657 --> 00:54:20.757]  I was in great shape.
[00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:21.878]  I had calluses on some weights.
[00:54:21.878 --> 00:54:24.079]  I was bleeding everywhere, even through the gloves.
[00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:27.000]  And it was like 12 hours in, and I said, listen, I'm tired.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.580]  What are you, a wimp?
[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:32.182]  You can't... People were real nice when they hired me, and they were like, ha ha, he's a wimp.
[00:54:32.182 --> 00:54:33.302]  He can't run that jackhammer.
[00:54:33.302 --> 00:54:34.283]  And they were just seeing what I could do.
[00:54:34.283 --> 00:54:39.845]  I kept the job about a month and said, hey, I don't... Let me tell you, a little too manly for me.
[00:54:41.738 --> 00:54:44.919]  Running jackhammers is hell.
[00:54:44.919 --> 00:54:49.180]  They rattle your teeth out of socket.
[00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:50.780]  But see, that's this whole world.
[00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:54.181]  How dare you run a jackhammer or climb down in that sewage?
[00:54:54.181 --> 00:55:01.183]  Or how dare you be a plumber that goes unclogs people's toilets all day with all the tampons and feces coming up in your face?
[00:55:01.183 --> 00:55:06.164]  You're a dirty man, you piece of crap!
[00:55:06.164 --> 00:55:06.244]  Oh!
[00:55:07.383 --> 00:55:17.116]  But you don't hear a stinking fat word out of these feminist, America-hating, man-hating monsters who are sabotaging our country when we have all this.
[00:55:17.116 --> 00:55:17.977]  AP!
[00:55:17.977 --> 00:55:18.678]  UN!
[00:55:18.678 --> 00:55:22.903]  Women migrants in Libya often face gang rape, abuse, slavery.
[00:55:22.903 --> 00:55:25.687]  Migrants captured in Libya say they end up sold as slaves.
[00:55:26.971 --> 00:55:28.152]  Including men.
[00:55:28.152 --> 00:55:32.414]  Women, mostly at risk from traffickers in India and Libya.
[00:55:32.414 --> 00:55:35.075]  Oh, guess who runs the female trafficking in India?
[00:55:35.075 --> 00:55:37.276]  Oh, the little religion of peace people.
[00:55:37.276 --> 00:55:41.659]  Child bribes in Africa are advertised on Facebook and sold to men.
[00:55:41.659 --> 00:55:45.361]  Daily Beast doesn't tell you, it's Muslims!
[00:55:45.361 --> 00:55:51.924]  As a Rotter Ham grooming gang survivor, I want people to know about the religious extremism which inspired my abusers.
[00:55:51.924 --> 00:55:52.744]  The Independent.
[00:55:52.744 --> 00:55:53.305]  Muslims!
[00:55:54.321 --> 00:56:04.391]  Sex slavery, kidnapping, number of child sex abuse victims in Rotterdam, that's one town, raised to 1,510, because nobody'd say a damn word.
[00:56:04.391 --> 00:56:14.601]  Just like drag time story, when convicted pedophiles come and have your kid bounce on their knee at the public school or wherever, and you don't get told, because it wouldn't be nice to run their background.
[00:56:14.601 --> 00:56:17.243]  After all, they're wearing a damn disguise.
[00:56:17.243 --> 00:56:17.664]  You understand?
[00:56:19.147 --> 00:56:26.260]  So next time some leftist pig gets in your face and tells you how bad America sucks, get back in their face and let them know.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:31.250]  Because they've been set up and prepared at these universities to bring this country down, and they make me sick.
[00:56:33.817 --> 00:56:38.262]  We've got a special guest who helped expose the second convicted child rapist.
[00:56:38.262 --> 00:56:39.984]  This guy raped a six-year-old boy.
[00:56:39.984 --> 00:56:42.908]  The other guy was convicted, raped a six-year-old boy as well.
[00:56:42.908 --> 00:56:48.034]  They're all part of the same team that dress up in disguises and then go have their time with your children.
[00:56:48.034 --> 00:56:53.881]  You're going to see shocking footage, ladies and gentlemen, of him actually grooming small children and giving them roses.
[00:56:56.205 --> 00:56:58.386]  Red roses.
[00:56:58.386 --> 00:57:00.887]  What's... perhaps a box of candy?
[00:57:00.887 --> 00:57:03.268]  I have candy in the van.
[00:57:03.268 --> 00:57:05.469]  I have puppies.
[00:57:05.469 --> 00:57:09.411]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:09.411 --> 00:57:23.217]  Children brought into men dressed as satanic clowns going... I can't even help it, the video's like... around your kids... So, this is all the liberalism.

[00:57:49.554 --> 00:57:57.376]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[00:57:57.376 --> 00:58:00.697]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[00:58:00.697 --> 00:58:03.798]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[00:58:03.798 --> 00:58:05.359]  I didn't invent all this.
[00:58:05.359 --> 00:58:11.921]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:14.702]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[00:58:15.765 --> 00:58:19.126]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[00:58:19.126 --> 00:58:23.748]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[00:58:23.748 --> 00:58:37.292]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.

[00:58:50.735 --> 00:58:53.836]  Our grandparents, our great-grandparents knew that they canned food.
[00:58:53.836 --> 00:58:56.736]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[00:58:56.736 --> 00:58:59.697]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:58:59.697 --> 00:59:04.258]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of MyPatriotSupply, one of the top

[00:59:52.808 --> 01:00:03.312]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.312 --> 01:00:18.098]  Ladies and gentlemen, if there was an army of financed pedophiles and their supporters dressing as clowns, disguising themselves, being given access to children as young as three, convicted pedophiles, would you want to know about it?
[01:00:18.098 --> 01:00:19.179]  Would you want to stand up against it?
[01:00:19.935 --> 01:00:25.236]  Or would you be like local Houston News that laughed and said, gotta get them while they're young?
[01:00:25.236 --> 01:00:27.697]  A lot of folks are joining the globalist team right now.
[01:00:27.697 --> 01:00:34.419]  A lot of people are showing the world they're willing to do whatever it takes for their father Lucifer to give them power.
[01:00:34.419 --> 01:00:39.320]  But we're not going to go along with that and so we're going inside the real it.
[01:00:40.509 --> 01:00:47.391]  The real gang of sickos dressed as clowns targeting your children in every county, every city of the United States.
[01:00:47.391 --> 01:00:49.212]  Their forces are rising.
[01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:51.712]  We're facing a major offensive by them.
[01:00:51.712 --> 01:00:59.035]  We'll talk to a brave woman and others who've exposed not one, but two in one nest of child predators in Houston on the other side.
[01:00:59.035 --> 01:01:00.215]  But first, here's Mark Dice.
[01:01:01.752 --> 01:01:08.976]  Looks like I got a new fan, you guys, but before I show you who it is, I'm pretty sure you'll be able to tell just from hearing her trademark laugh.
[01:01:08.976 --> 01:01:16.779]  She posted a brief clip of one of my videos on her YouTube channel, and you can hear her in the background, and it sounds like she really likes me.
[01:01:16.779 --> 01:01:25.924]  ABC News citing sources familiar with the investigation reporting that no more indictments are coming from the special counsel.
[01:01:29.908 --> 01:01:32.011]  Yep, that's the one and only Roseanne Barr.
[01:01:32.011 --> 01:01:33.753]  Thanks for the shoutout, Roseanne.
[01:01:33.753 --> 01:01:40.500]  As you know, YouTube's one of the only places you can do comedy these days, since it's obviously not allowed on the big networks anymore.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:40.961]  Someone else
[01:01:40.981 --> 01:01:41.661]  I say kids, I hug people.
[01:01:59.752 --> 01:02:14.708]  Not everybody thought it was funny though because of course liberals don't have a sense of humor!
[01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:19.453]  The Daily Beast reported that Trump tweeted out a doctored video!
[01:02:19.453 --> 01:02:20.494]  It was doctored!
[01:02:20.794 --> 01:02:30.061]  I'm sorry, but the verb doctored means, quote, to change the content or appearance of in order to deceive or falsify.
[01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:32.523]  Just so you know, this video is fake.
[01:02:32.523 --> 01:02:38.648]  Meme Master Carpe D'Ante must have taken the original Joe Biden video and edited it.
[01:02:38.648 --> 01:02:42.851]  Business Insider said that it was a ridiculously edited video.
[01:02:43.231 --> 01:02:49.839]  The doctored video appears to have been originally posted by the conservative account, Carpe Dantum.
[01:02:49.839 --> 01:02:52.101]  How dare you post doctored videos, Carpe!
[01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:53.823]  And I used to think that you were cool!
[01:02:53.823 --> 01:02:55.145]  Looks like Donald Trump Jr.
[01:02:55.145 --> 01:03:01.452]  tweeted it out as well, so Newsweek Magazine is calling him out for sharing the doctored video.
[01:03:01.452 --> 01:03:04.055]  It's called a meme, morons, and it's hilarious!
[01:03:04.375 --> 01:03:20.335]  Having no clue about internet culture and not understanding that you should never feed a troll by responding to them, Joe Biden of course responded, quote tweeting President Trump's tweet and saying, I see that you are on the job and presidential as always.
[01:03:20.715 --> 01:03:24.178]  The Joe Biden memes are the best thing happening on the internet right now.
[01:03:24.178 --> 01:03:35.867]  And one of the greatest ones is that famous picture of Lindsey Graham smiling and walking away from some crazy protesters while adjusting his tie and somebody inserted Joe Biden into the background.
[01:03:36.147 --> 01:03:47.277]  Somebody even took a still image of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's live stream the other night when she was putting together IKEA furniture in her empty apartment and inserted Joe Biden into that.
[01:03:47.277 --> 01:03:54.684]  There's even a Jussie Smollett Joe Biden meme that's captioned, he smelled my hair and whispered, this is Biden country.
[01:03:54.684 --> 01:03:56.605]  Somebody even made up these Biden 2020 t-shirts.
[01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:00.749]  But liberals are always trying to ruin our fun.
[01:04:00.749 --> 01:04:10.296]  YouTube demonetized my video from Tuesday saying it must have been an April Fool's joke when Time Magazine put Alexandria Calfart's Cortez on the cover.
[01:04:10.296 --> 01:04:15.741]  After the Thought Police manually reviewed it, they confirmed that it was non-advertiser friendly.
[01:04:16.041 --> 01:04:19.602]  Apparently you're not allowed to make fun of Her Royal Highness.
[01:04:19.602 --> 01:04:28.345]  The video I did about her socialism stupidly spreading and other Democrats afraid to say that they were capitalists, that had to get submitted for a manual review.
[01:04:28.345 --> 01:04:37.888]  Even the one titled Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Rocket Scientist got demonetized as soon as I uploaded it and had to be submitted for a manual review.
[01:04:40.373 --> 01:04:41.234]  It's Mark Dice.
[01:04:41.234 --> 01:04:42.276]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:42.276 --> 01:04:52.210]  Coming up, inside the cult of men disguising themselves as clowns and then being given access by public schools, elementary schools, libraries to your children.

[01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:04.894]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:04.894 --> 01:07:05.634]  Welcome back.
[01:07:05.634 --> 01:07:12.296]  I am collecting more evidence, more research, more documentation for you, and really getting ready.
[01:07:12.296 --> 01:07:14.537]  That's why I was about a minute late getting back on air.
[01:07:14.537 --> 01:07:22.060]  So we're going to have our guest on for the next three segments, the last 45 minutes of the hour, when we go to break here in about nine minutes.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:28.923]  Because I want to line up all the names, all the people, all the preparation, because this is so big, this is so serious, this is so crazy.
[01:07:28.923 --> 01:07:32.284]  I mean, I'm ready to launch into this right now, but I want to give you the big picture.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:39.284]  And I want to break down every facet and every angle of this for you on the other side of this segment.
[01:07:39.284 --> 01:07:41.145]  So I was just running in here getting these clips ready.
[01:07:41.145 --> 01:07:45.868]  I've been getting ready before the show today with all this information, still working on it.
[01:07:45.868 --> 01:07:50.932]  Try to present it as hardcore, but as judicious as I can.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:08:17.920]  There are groups of men, not just here but in Europe, who are all part of the same club, it's the exact same formula, they say the same things, they do the same things, dressed as demonic clowns, calling themselves drag queens, being given access to your children, and a second one, in the same town, in the same operation, was just busted yesterday being a convicted rapist of a six-year-old boy.
[01:08:19.448 --> 01:08:25.733]  Now, of course, I began to notice that the so-called drag queens, at their own events, don't dress in the demon outfits.
[01:08:25.733 --> 01:08:31.778]  It's with the kids, because they enjoy the fear of the children, and the parents and teachers shoving them into their arms.
[01:08:31.778 --> 01:08:34.139]  It's a very demonic exercise.
[01:08:34.139 --> 01:08:39.764]  But it's because they have to have aliases, because many of them have criminal records.
[01:08:39.764 --> 01:08:43.266]  This is a massive, organized plan.
[01:08:43.266 --> 01:08:47.430]  So, we're gonna get our old duckies in a row.
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:51.183]  And we're going to come back and we're going to present this.
[01:08:51.183 --> 01:08:54.026]  The children are worth it.
[01:08:54.026 --> 01:08:55.829]  They're worth us exposing this.
[01:08:57.310 --> 01:09:07.516]  And they're worth you getting the article that's on InfoWars.com, and later when we post this report as a video to InfoWars.com, they are worth you taking the time to get this article out.
[01:09:07.516 --> 01:09:08.636]  Bombshell.
[01:09:08.636 --> 01:09:14.820]  Another Drag Queen Story Hour member exposed as a pedophile investigation shows.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:22.704]  Now there you can see him in his normal female outfit, but we probably need to change that photo out from his own face, but when he's in the demon outfit.
[01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.194]  And so, in fact, let me just do that.
[01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:25.834]  Doc McKim, please.
[01:09:25.834 --> 01:09:27.895]  I'm going to go ahead and show you this.
[01:09:27.895 --> 01:09:30.517]  This is the individual, the convicted pedophile.
[01:09:30.517 --> 01:09:32.878]  We'll tell you his name and everything.
[01:09:32.878 --> 01:09:35.539]  In his vampire demon outfit.
[01:09:35.539 --> 01:09:38.001]  Hello, children.
[01:09:38.001 --> 01:09:40.402]  Oh, no big deal.
[01:09:40.402 --> 01:09:41.583]  TV viewers are seeing this.
[01:09:41.583 --> 01:09:42.923]  Radio listeners are lucky not to.
[01:09:42.923 --> 01:09:45.625]  And then here is the actual outfit worn with children.
[01:09:45.625 --> 01:09:49.187]  And the mouth is always open like he's auditioning for a vampire movie.
[01:09:50.387 --> 01:09:53.769]  And so it's always the same style, the same deal.
[01:09:53.769 --> 01:09:59.131]  The children recoil in fear, but local news says, hey, they'll get used to it.
[01:09:59.131 --> 01:10:00.632]  It's for their own good.
[01:10:00.632 --> 01:10:04.234]  Gotta get them while they're young.
[01:10:04.234 --> 01:10:06.735]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, this is not a joke.
[01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:11.237]  You always hear these big viral stories about a kid saw a clown in the woods and the whole town's afraid.
[01:10:12.247 --> 01:10:20.832]  But if a bunch of demon clowns show up at your school and can't sit on their laps, in some cases like Colorado and New York, they don't tell the parents they're coming.
[01:10:20.832 --> 01:10:23.914]  And they tell them, you're gonna be one of us forever.
[01:10:23.914 --> 01:10:27.657]  You're coming with us to a nice place.
[01:10:29.977 --> 01:10:32.018]  Convicted child rapist raped a six-year-old boy.
[01:10:32.018 --> 01:10:34.879]  Convicted child rapist raped a six-year-old boy.
[01:10:34.879 --> 01:10:44.723]  People on screen and they've got your children and the school and all the people act really excited and real weird like a big naughty thing's happening.
[01:10:44.723 --> 01:10:48.385]  Because there's a lot of people in on this.
[01:10:48.385 --> 01:10:50.306]  The energy of children is sacred.
[01:10:51.067 --> 01:10:57.150]  And those that are willing to extract it, the vampire priest, are very important.
[01:10:57.150 --> 01:11:07.174]  And since the ancient days of Greece, sometimes they would have this madness afflict a town in Greece, the different areas, different kingdoms, and they would have actually vampire hunting.
[01:11:08.359 --> 01:11:15.601]  And they would actually go out into the ruins of old cities or the woods and find the mentally ill people that were possessed who thought they were vampires and kill them.
[01:11:15.601 --> 01:11:22.303]  This is in the history books because they would sneak in at night and grab their kids and try to drink their blood.
[01:11:22.303 --> 01:11:26.685]  And so it just happens over and over again that this mass psychosis happens.
[01:11:26.685 --> 01:11:29.185]  And the vampire always acts effeminate too.
[01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:30.046]  It's a thing it does.
[01:11:30.046 --> 01:11:31.906]  It's like, oh, I'm a liberal.
[01:11:31.906 --> 01:11:33.547]  Oh, I'm a female.
[01:11:33.547 --> 01:11:35.187]  Oh, let me take care of you.
[01:11:35.187 --> 01:11:36.988]  And again, we've studied them.
[01:11:38.032 --> 01:11:41.300]  You have to understand who they are and that's where we are.
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.566]  Now I'm telling the story about Greece and what they did.
[01:11:43.566 --> 01:11:44.769]  I'm not saying that's a good thing now.
[01:11:46.155 --> 01:11:48.337]  But I just said they should not be given access to children.
[01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:52.820]  If you see a man in a clown outfit with their mouth open like a moray eel, going, ehhh.
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:54.842]  But sometimes they actually around you will go, ehhh.
[01:11:54.842 --> 01:11:56.123]  We've gone and covered their events.
[01:11:56.123 --> 01:11:58.185]  In front of the kids they go, oh, now you're sweet.
[01:11:58.185 --> 01:12:01.287]  And they go, ehhh, oh, ehhh.
[01:12:01.287 --> 01:12:12.877]  Whatever it is possessing them, at whatever corner of deep space or another dimension, just has a craved desire, a fiendish desire to get their hands on your children.
[01:12:14.321 --> 01:12:20.086]  So I'll get focused and go to the presentation on the other side of this break.
[01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:28.853]  Also, we will, after our guest leaves us, open the phones up, Vatican Cardinal warns West will disappear because of mass migration.
[01:12:28.853 --> 01:12:30.534]  Every Catholic you know should see this.
[01:12:30.534 --> 01:12:32.176]  This guy's made a bold move.
[01:12:32.176 --> 01:12:39.362]  Vatican Cardinal Robert Serra says the West will disappear, says the Vatican is trying to sell out the West and it's very dangerous.
[01:12:39.362 --> 01:12:42.504]  This guy's very bold, a real leader, very, very excited.
[01:12:43.405 --> 01:12:48.228]  Like Paul Watson said, if this guy becomes the next Pope, he'll convert to Catholicism.
[01:12:48.228 --> 01:12:52.671]  Yeah, I mean, I guess this guy is like an old-fashioned Catholic who isn't suicidal.
[01:12:52.671 --> 01:12:55.693]  So we'll be talking about that as well.
[01:12:55.693 --> 01:13:01.476]  One big thing I want to tell everybody about, and that's DNA Force.
[01:13:01.476 --> 01:13:08.921]  I remember researching five years ago what the most highly rated, most successful, most profitable
[01:13:10.356 --> 01:13:12.318]  Supplements out there were.
[01:13:12.318 --> 01:13:17.161]  What people love, what work great, and what people buy so we can fund our operation while helping people at the same time.
[01:13:17.161 --> 01:13:17.942]  A 360 win.
[01:13:17.942 --> 01:13:21.484]  So you like it, it works good, you come back.
[01:13:21.484 --> 01:13:22.625]  It's a good relationship.
[01:13:22.625 --> 01:13:23.425]  A win-win.
[01:13:23.425 --> 01:13:24.947]  A Christian relationship.
[01:13:24.947 --> 01:13:26.468]  Do unto others as you have them do unto you.
[01:13:27.665 --> 01:13:28.846]  A win-win.
[01:13:28.846 --> 01:13:29.606]  A 360 win.
[01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:37.731]  And so I looked into telomeres slowing their decline, which is the same as actually extending their life.
[01:13:37.731 --> 01:13:38.992]  That's in the DNA.
[01:13:38.992 --> 01:13:41.053]  That's what makes you age.
[01:13:41.053 --> 01:13:43.775]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, all of it.
[01:13:43.775 --> 01:13:46.897]  Most of it wasn't organic out there, but it was still overpriced.
[01:13:46.897 --> 01:13:50.439]  To get the organic-derived types that are certified is more expensive.
[01:13:50.439 --> 01:13:51.460]  It's very, very hard to make.
[01:13:53.038 --> 01:13:55.039]  And so we developed DNA Force.
[01:13:55.039 --> 01:14:02.020]  Now, most quality level systems like this, people aren't gonna buy at their big box store like Whole Foods or whatever.
[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.721]  You've gotta get it at a medical clinic.
[01:14:03.721 --> 01:14:06.021]  It's not prescription.
[01:14:06.021 --> 01:14:10.483]  People aren't ready to pay 300, 400 bucks for it because of the research and the markup.
[01:14:10.483 --> 01:14:16.744]  We just cut out the five to seven times markup and did 150% markup.
[01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:18.745]  Then we always have it discounted to about 100% markup.
[01:14:20.746 --> 01:14:33.337]  It's 60% off right now, so it's right down close to cost, and it's been sold out for six months, but I want you to experience this amazing formula at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:14:33.337 --> 01:14:36.760]  I want you to experience what it does.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:42.885]  Now, it takes a few weeks to kick in, just like X2, but if you will just simply read the reviews, 97%
[01:14:45.319 --> 01:14:47.941]  Positive 4.7 stars.
[01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:49.402]  This is the DNA Force Plus.
[01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:50.983]  When you reformulate, you always got to change the name.
[01:14:50.983 --> 01:14:54.145]  So when you see plus, it just means like brain force or this.
[01:14:54.145 --> 01:14:55.305]  We made it stronger.
[01:14:55.305 --> 01:14:56.966]  Switch down plus.
[01:14:56.966 --> 01:15:03.971]  And I signed a bigger contract to order more for a longer period, was able to bring down our cost about 50%.
[01:15:06.658 --> 01:15:11.079]  So that's why I've been able to drop it massively at $59 right now.
[01:15:11.079 --> 01:15:15.120]  This costs thousands of dollars per kilo, just the PQQ and the CoQ10.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.261]  At that price, nothing gets within light years of this.
[01:15:19.261 --> 01:15:25.963]  This is the best system when it comes to telomeres and the mitochondria and the antioxidant out there.
[01:15:25.963 --> 01:15:27.163]  This is to the next level.
[01:15:27.163 --> 01:15:32.965]  I mean, just one of the things in it, you gotta eat like 40 cartons of blueberries to get the same amount of it, the PQQ.
[01:15:32.965 --> 01:15:33.845]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:15:34.585 --> 01:15:36.647]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:15:36.647 --> 01:15:41.310]  Infowarslife.com is the sub-site where it takes you right to the supplements.
[01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:46.714]  Infowarslife.com, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50-60% off all the supplements.
[01:15:46.714 --> 01:15:48.315]  That all ends this weekend.
[01:15:48.315 --> 01:15:52.798]  A few of the items will extend out, but everything else is selling out, so take advantage of this right now.
[01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.439]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:15:54.439 --> 01:15:55.220]  Thank you for the support.
[01:15:57.624 --> 01:15:58.885]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.885 --> 01:16:00.165]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.165 --> 01:16:03.906]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.906 --> 01:16:04.987]  Forget bunkers.

[01:16:27.099 --> 01:16:33.441]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.441 --> 01:16:36.481]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.481 --> 01:16:42.403]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.403 --> 01:16:46.204]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.204 --> 01:16:47.464]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.464 --> 01:16:48.804]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:55.006]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:55.006 --> 01:16:56.426]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.463 --> 01:16:59.424]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:59.424 --> 01:17:04.748]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:04.748 --> 01:17:06.329]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.329 --> 01:17:14.694]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:14.694 --> 01:17:20.378]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:17:20.538 --> 01:17:22.379]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:17:22.379 --> 01:17:24.540]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:29.042]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:29.042 --> 01:17:31.223]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:17:58.462 --> 01:17:58.962]  It's simple.
[01:17:58.962 --> 01:18:05.086]  If you want to beat the globalists, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[01:18:05.086 --> 01:18:07.568]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:18:07.568 --> 01:18:11.210]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late term abortion and all great it is.
[01:18:11.210 --> 01:18:13.972]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:18:13.972 --> 01:18:15.052]  What is the top tumor?
[01:18:15.052 --> 01:18:17.194]  It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:18:17.194 --> 01:18:19.115]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[01:18:19.235 --> 01:18:19.455]  Okay.
[01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:35.049]  Have you ever done that?
[01:18:35.049 --> 01:18:37.770]  Sir, the average competitor is 3 to 5 percent.
[01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:39.010]  The top brand is 50 percent.
[01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:41.731]  I'm like, we're going to have 95 percent of your humanoid.
[01:18:41.731 --> 01:18:44.652]  I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information is explosive.
[01:18:44.652 --> 01:18:45.272]  Our fish oil.
[01:18:45.272 --> 01:18:47.812]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[01:18:47.812 --> 01:18:48.873]  My children take it.
[01:18:48.873 --> 01:18:53.214]  You think I'm going to give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:18:53.214 --> 01:18:56.215]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[01:18:56.215 --> 01:18:56.515]  Never!
[01:18:58.155 --> 01:19:03.358]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:19:03.358 --> 01:19:11.942]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:19:11.942 --> 01:19:14.904]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:19:14.904 --> 01:19:16.645]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:19:16.645 --> 01:19:22.928]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[01:19:25.029 --> 01:19:30.352]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[01:19:30.352 --> 01:19:33.294]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:19:33.294 --> 01:19:37.236]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:19:37.236 --> 01:19:41.218]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:19:41.218 --> 01:19:43.039]  I've got two in my home.
[01:19:43.039 --> 01:19:49.122]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:19:49.122 --> 01:19:49.983]  Don't live
[01:19:50.803 --> 01:19:54.870]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[01:19:54.870 --> 01:20:01.881]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:04.485]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.784 --> 01:20:25.471]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:20:25.471 --> 01:20:27.774]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:49.260]  We're here today, once again, because of the malfeasance of the Mayor Turner and the administration of the Houston Public Library and their negligence in doing background checks on volunteers who volunteer to help with Drag Queen Story Hour at the Houston Public Library.
[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:53.082]  The mass resistance and human rights activists that work with us
[01:20:54.263 --> 01:21:02.250]  We have been raising the alarm for months and asking questions about this program, demanding documents to make sure that they had done due diligence.
[01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:03.831]  We've been denied those documents.
[01:21:03.831 --> 01:21:09.276]  We still have not got them despite the Attorney General demanding that those were released to us.
[01:21:10.425 --> 01:21:11.987]  We want to know how many more.
[01:21:11.987 --> 01:21:20.638]  We want an audit of the entire Houston Public Library system because now we know not just one convicted sex offender has been told.
[01:21:39.318 --> 01:21:45.601]  Well, they went running out of space all right.
[01:22:09.897 --> 01:22:19.704]  For the rest of the hour, we're going to go down a rabbit hole that is sickening, that is frightening, that is disgusting, that is demonic, but it must be plumbed.
[01:22:19.704 --> 01:22:24.167]  Because if we don't do this, they're going to continue to have access to our children.
[01:22:24.167 --> 01:22:25.548]  Not one, but two.
[01:22:25.548 --> 01:22:34.573]  In the same drag queen story time events at public schools, elementary schools, libraries.
[01:22:34.573 --> 01:22:35.934]  In Colorado, they don't even ask.
[01:22:35.934 --> 01:22:38.216]  They bring these kids into the elementary school without even telling the parents.
[01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:45.694]  Two of the ringleaders convicted rapists, both of them of six-year-old boys.
[01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:51.718]  Drag queen who read to kids at Houston Library is convicted pedophile.
[01:22:51.718 --> 01:23:00.004]  Goes by Tatiana Malanina, which means bad girl, Alberto Garza, 32.
[01:23:00.004 --> 01:23:03.506]  Served many years in jail for raping a six-year-old and aggravated assault.
[01:23:05.771 --> 01:23:11.514]  And of course, uses an alias and dresses as a clown to cover his identity.
[01:23:11.514 --> 01:23:14.836]  And then they call themselves Drag Queens.
[01:23:14.836 --> 01:23:31.986]  Now, bombshell, another Drag Queen story, our member exposed as pedophile investigations show, William Travis Dees, good lord, operating under four different aliases, but they were able to track him down by going and watching their social media.
[01:23:33.502 --> 01:23:35.683]  and discover what he was really up to.
[01:23:35.683 --> 01:23:41.626]  He was convicted of aggravated assault of a six-year-old boy as well.
[01:23:41.626 --> 01:23:54.371]  Houston mass resistance activists have a drag queen story hour victory against huge odds testifying before the City Council and joining us is Tracy Shannon of massresistance.org massresistance.org
[01:23:56.596 --> 01:23:59.137]  You have to understand, folks, they're coordinated.
[01:23:59.137 --> 01:24:01.218]  Out of New York is where this all started.
[01:24:01.218 --> 01:24:03.538]  It's on national TV, they're pushing it.
[01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:06.379]  CNN, AP is telling you it's great.
[01:24:06.379 --> 01:24:08.640]  Local news says, hey, gotta get the kids while they're young.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:11.001]  I'm gonna play that clip coming up.
[01:24:11.001 --> 01:24:13.422]  This is all a sick joke on everyone.
[01:24:14.318 --> 01:24:20.760]  And so this is literally a gang of pedophiles and pedophile supporters, and those that want to sexualize children.
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:21.880]  They admit they're grooming them.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.140]  I'm going to play those videos.
[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:25.801]  They have the rubber chickens saying, come to me, my chickens.
[01:24:25.801 --> 01:24:28.422]  They're handing the kids roses.
[01:24:28.422 --> 01:24:30.542]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:24:30.542 --> 01:24:35.024]  This is introducing themselves, dressed like vampire clowns, to children.
[01:24:35.024 --> 01:24:36.064]  And this wonderful woman
[01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:38.711]  Well, um, how did I get alerted to this?
[01:24:38.711 --> 01:24:44.955]  I just started, uh, first I was going to do a friend called, another woman who's part of Mass Resistance here, and said, they're doing drag queen story hours at the library.
[01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:05.389]  What do you know about this, Tracy?
[01:25:05.389 --> 01:25:07.470]  I said, well, I didn't know they were doing it locally.
[01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:09.511]  I thought they had had one event locally.
[01:25:09.511 --> 01:25:13.232]  I didn't know it was a routine deal, initially, several months ago.
[01:25:13.232 --> 01:25:14.372]  She was really disturbed.
[01:25:14.372 --> 01:25:15.753]  She's a grandmother in the community.
[01:25:15.753 --> 01:25:17.914]  She goes, well, can we offer a Bible story time?
[01:25:17.914 --> 01:25:20.074]  I said, hey, I'd be willing to do a part of that.
[01:25:20.074 --> 01:25:22.715]  Let's go about doing our applications.
[01:25:22.715 --> 01:25:23.496]  And so we did.
[01:25:23.496 --> 01:25:24.916]  And she was told by...
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:42.790]  No religion is allowed in the library, and that excludes... And she went into great detail on the phone to her, explaining why even, you know, Islam can't be allowed, Judaism, Christianity, none of those.
[01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:45.392]  And then I said, oh, I would love to get that in writing.
[01:25:45.392 --> 01:25:54.799]  So, I applied, or emailed directly at the beginning of the application process and said, how about a Christianity...
[01:25:57.378 --> 01:25:59.860]  Well, that's how the Satanists operate.
[01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:16.529]  Everybody else's speech out, claiming separation of church and state.
[01:26:16.529 --> 01:26:17.130]  No.
[01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:20.912]  The school or library can't have an official religion under the First Amendment.
[01:26:20.912 --> 01:26:21.832]  I agree with that.
[01:26:21.832 --> 01:26:25.995]  But you can have, if students or parents are involved, any club you want.
[01:26:25.995 --> 01:26:29.737]  That's why schools allow Satanist clubs, but not Christian clubs.
[01:26:29.737 --> 01:26:33.759]  So again, they create a vacuum so that now you have the pedo club come in.
[01:26:35.249 --> 01:26:47.355]  Right, and you can have a Christian story time or something like that, and they want to lean on the First Amendment and say that's how they can have a drag queen story hour, but that's not correct.
[01:26:47.355 --> 01:26:58.320]  The First Amendment is not there to protect lewdness and promotion of sexuality, sexual behavior, and ideas that are reflective of adult sexual content and promote sexual
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:06.509]  It doesn't protect a bunch of men dressed up like demon clowns, most of which are sex workers, from having access to children.
[01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:08.741]  That's right, that's right.
[01:27:08.741 --> 01:27:10.862]  That's not what it's supposed to be for.
[01:27:10.862 --> 01:27:29.074]  And we can absolutely have, at our local levels, and I hope people listening will start this in your own communities, get your municipality to get some language governing what kind of programs and content can be part of children's programming in your libraries.
[01:27:29.074 --> 01:27:31.756]  That is allowable under First Amendment.
[01:27:31.756 --> 01:27:34.558]  And even the American Library Association Bill of Rights
[01:27:35.038 --> 01:27:37.800]  Well, a lot of this is blackmail, too.
[01:27:50.163 --> 01:27:59.875]  A lot of these sex workers, which Mr. Deese admits he is, William Travis Deese, get blackmail on the local officials and people.
[01:27:59.875 --> 01:28:04.521]  That's another way they're able to take over, but this person looks like a psychotic.
[01:28:05.302 --> 01:28:15.349]  And the video we're going to play after the break is walking around giving children roses while talking about chicken, which is a public, not even code word, for underage boys.
[01:28:15.349 --> 01:28:17.091]  So this is just bizarre.
[01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:18.172]  It's gone this far.
[01:28:18.172 --> 01:28:25.117]  What are they going to do now when we come back that two out of one nest that you've exposed have done this?
[01:28:25.117 --> 01:28:30.621]  No joke, a cult-like gang of men disguising themselves as clowns are targeting children
[01:28:32.111 --> 01:28:35.054]  In the U.S., U.K., and Europe.
[01:28:35.054 --> 01:28:38.117]  That's the emergency report up on InfoWars.com.
[01:28:38.117 --> 01:28:40.879]  We'll talk to Tracy Shannon on the other side.
[01:28:40.879 --> 01:28:42.501]  She's visiting somebody in the hospital right now.
[01:28:42.501 --> 01:28:43.782]  She's on the cell phone.
[01:28:43.782 --> 01:28:44.462]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.462 --> 01:28:44.863]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.863 --> 01:28:47.926]  Please spread that article on InfoWars.com.
[01:28:47.926 --> 01:28:49.067]  Please.
[01:28:49.067 --> 01:28:50.208]  Get it out there.
[01:28:50.208 --> 01:28:51.349]  This is what we're fighting.
[01:28:57.559 --> 01:28:59.882]  Ew, get the stinky dog away from me.
[01:28:59.882 --> 01:29:01.383]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[01:29:01.383 --> 01:29:02.684]  PD stopped eating.
[01:29:02.684 --> 01:29:03.926]  All his hair fell out.
[01:29:03.926 --> 01:29:06.088]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[01:29:06.088 --> 01:29:08.330]  At least $5,000 in that bill.
[01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:10.372]  Cranes, antibiotics, sprays.
[01:29:10.372 --> 01:29:11.293]  No results.
[01:29:11.293 --> 01:29:13.795]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynavite.
[01:29:13.795 --> 01:29:16.718]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E dot com.
[01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:18.740]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you gotta feed it something healthy.
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:20.860]  The Omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:26.822]  Flaxseed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dog food.
[01:29:26.822 --> 01:29:29.002]  Dynavite is nutrition.
[01:29:29.002 --> 01:29:30.803]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.
[01:29:30.803 --> 01:29:36.404]  Her coat is not soft, it's silky, it's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:37.964]  She's got life, she's got energy.
[01:29:37.964 --> 01:29:39.965]  Tons of energy, no more bad smell.
[01:29:39.965 --> 01:29:41.345]  Dynavite's the bomb.
[01:29:41.345 --> 01:29:46.306]  Dynavite is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs, you know, besides me, of course.
[01:29:46.766 --> 01:30:06.393]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1-thousand 8-5-9-4-2-8-1-thousand Dinovite for life D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E dot com There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[01:30:06.393 --> 01:30:09.134]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:30:09.721 --> 01:30:12.825]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:30:12.825 --> 01:30:14.387]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:30:14.387 --> 01:30:20.954]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:30:20.954 --> 01:30:23.738]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[01:30:24.793 --> 01:30:28.156]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:32.781]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[01:30:32.781 --> 01:30:46.315]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:30:46.315 --> 01:30:48.256]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[01:30:48.897 --> 01:30:54.161]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[01:30:54.161 --> 01:30:59.385]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[01:30:59.385 --> 01:31:00.806]  I want to say BrainForce is great.
[01:31:00.806 --> 01:31:02.747]  I want to say TurboForce is amazing.
[01:31:02.747 --> 01:31:03.327]  It is!
[01:31:03.327 --> 01:31:04.888]  But if you took it with fish oil...
[01:31:06.142 --> 01:31:07.704]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[01:31:22.924 --> 01:31:24.886]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:31:49.656 --> 01:31:55.683]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:31:55.683 --> 01:31:56.404]  I just can't do it!
[01:31:58.496 --> 01:32:09.086]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:09.086 --> 01:32:11.148]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:11.148 --> 01:32:14.030]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:15.512]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:15.512 --> 01:32:22.338]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body, and it supports the info war.
[01:32:22.338 --> 01:32:23.619]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:34.108]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:34.108 --> 01:32:50.941]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:32:50.941 --> 01:32:54.104]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:32:54.244 --> 01:33:01.316]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:33:01.316 --> 01:33:03.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.665 --> 01:33:25.287]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:25.287 --> 01:33:31.809]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.809 --> 01:33:34.349]  Tracy Shannon is at the hospital in Houston.
[01:33:34.349 --> 01:33:36.050]  She's about to get another grandbaby.
[01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:36.630]  Very excited.
[01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:39.631]  She may have to go anytime, but baby, looks like they're coming right now.
[01:33:41.203 --> 01:33:54.146]  We're going to protect that baby from the two convicted child rapists who dress up in demonic clown outfits, scarier than Hit the Clown, and who are with a bunch of other men disguising their identities.
[01:33:54.146 --> 01:33:56.346]  A bunch of admitted sex workers.
[01:33:56.346 --> 01:33:57.786]  In fact, let's play this clip first.
[01:33:57.786 --> 01:34:01.867]  Here's a clip we've been playing quite a few times.
[01:34:01.867 --> 01:34:09.629]  And this is an admitted, in the full video, sex worker at a Lafayette, Louisiana city council meeting
[01:34:11.494 --> 01:34:19.499]  Saying, oh, at night I dress as a woman and entertain men at the local gay club, but when I'm with your children, it's different and you won't stop me, hater.
[01:34:19.499 --> 01:34:22.201]  I'm going to groom your children.
[01:34:22.201 --> 01:34:24.283]  And so that's what's going on here.
[01:34:24.283 --> 01:34:27.044]  And it's the same formula, not just here, but in Europe.
[01:34:27.044 --> 01:34:28.645]  It's called drag queen story time.
[01:34:28.645 --> 01:34:30.847]  The media promotes it.
[01:34:30.847 --> 01:34:34.409]  The corporate media, same one that promotes open borders and Islam.
[01:34:34.409 --> 01:34:35.890]  They bring them in.
[01:34:35.890 --> 01:34:37.391]  They don't check their ID.
[01:34:37.391 --> 01:34:38.292]  They don't check their background.
[01:34:39.582 --> 01:34:46.046]  And in places like Colorado and Denver, they don't even tell the parents they come in the school.
[01:34:46.046 --> 01:34:51.690]  So you can watch the full video at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:51.690 --> 01:34:55.732]  Drag Queen Admits He's Grooming Children at Story Hour Events.
[01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:56.453]  Here's that clip.
[01:34:58.803 --> 01:34:59.863]  My name's Dylan Pontiff.
[01:34:59.863 --> 01:35:03.665]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for Drag Queen Storytime.
[01:35:03.665 --> 01:35:07.766]  So, apparently to a lot of people in this room, I'm the big boogeyman.
[01:35:07.766 --> 01:35:12.428]  I am just as talented as a singer or a dancer or anyone that has a special talent.
[01:35:12.428 --> 01:35:16.189]  It's just mine is dressing up as a woman entertaining a crowd.
[01:35:16.189 --> 01:35:22.292]  The eyes that people give you whenever they think that you are the one that's in support of this event is truly disgusting.
[01:35:22.292 --> 01:35:25.753]  But I'm here to let you know that this event is something that's going to be very beautiful.
[01:35:26.153 --> 01:35:28.735]  And he goes on to say your children are ours.
[01:35:28.735 --> 01:35:32.058]  So, I'm gonna groom your children for the next generation.
[01:35:32.058 --> 01:35:32.738]  And I'm gonna do it.
[01:35:32.738 --> 01:35:34.920]  Your kids are gonna sit on my lap.
[01:35:56.653 --> 01:36:00.256]  Now, if anybody else did that at a park, they'd get in trouble.
[01:36:00.256 --> 01:36:02.317]  But what's happening is, no wonder they wear disguises.
[01:36:02.317 --> 01:36:03.538]  And I started noticing this last year.
[01:36:03.538 --> 01:36:09.202]  I said, at their own parties, we're looking at their Facebooks, we've got, you know, obviously investigators looking at them.
[01:36:09.202 --> 01:36:10.883]  Not just here, but other areas.
[01:36:10.883 --> 01:36:14.946]  I said, because we know who's running this whole show, we're going to bring the whole group down.
[01:36:14.946 --> 01:36:17.508]  But I said, notice, it's a disguise.
[01:36:18.686 --> 01:36:21.188]  From England to the U.S., they wear the same clown outfits.
[01:36:21.188 --> 01:36:25.550]  They're directed by the same group because a lot of them have convictions.
[01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:30.153]  That's why they show up by bus, they show up by Uber, they sneak into the building.
[01:36:30.153 --> 01:36:37.918]  And just imagine, these are people that are so obsessed with time with your children, so crazed, they can't stop.
[01:36:37.918 --> 01:36:40.720]  And pedophiles can't stop.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:44.923]  And so they've spent jail time, sometimes years in jail for raping little kids they kidnapped.
[01:36:48.191 --> 01:36:51.440]  And now the liberals are like, we're gonna let them have your kids.
[01:36:52.657 --> 01:36:54.798]  We're gonna let them have time with your kids.
[01:36:54.798 --> 01:37:19.030]  So going back to Tracy Shannon, MassResistance.org, you were getting into how you woke up, what you saw, no Christianity, nothing allowed in these things, but oh, this is allowed, their own sexualization of children, their own grooming, their own vampirist religion, and then boom, you discover the first guy, now the second guy, and the stuff on your website, I can hardly even show it, but people need to see it.
[01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:21.672]  This is frightening, men in bondage outfits,
[01:37:22.873 --> 01:37:26.636]  This is all being introduced to children.
[01:37:26.636 --> 01:37:46.234]  Right, and we started looking at the social media of the drag queen volunteers at the library, just so we could show our city council that these are not people to be held out as role models to our children, and that they are adult entertainers who push the boundaries of sexuality and
[01:37:47.455 --> 01:37:49.376]  That's what they do all the time.
[01:37:49.376 --> 01:37:56.138]  We have a video of one of these reading to a kid talking about how she prefers a Long Island iced tea.
[01:37:56.138 --> 01:37:58.639]  These people are not neat.
[01:37:58.639 --> 01:38:01.620]  It should not be in the library with children.
[01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:06.782]  The guy that runs it all is a convicted murderer out of New York that chops money up with a buzz saw.
[01:38:06.782 --> 01:38:10.123]  And they're on video with kids talking about taking ketamine and rohibinol.
[01:38:12.029 --> 01:38:12.769]  Oh, wow.
[01:38:12.769 --> 01:38:13.289]  Yeah.
[01:38:13.289 --> 01:38:19.391]  I mean, there's a lot of interesting people involved in this, to say the least.
[01:38:19.391 --> 01:38:31.714]  They say this is to promote diversity and inclusion and love and all that, but children are naturally accepting, and we shouldn't be trying to traumatize them or shock them into acceptance
[01:38:32.234 --> 01:38:35.617]  If you're a good person, a child's going to accept you.
[01:38:35.617 --> 01:38:48.866]  You don't have to force it with this shocking stuff they're doing with children at libraries and wrong-headed parents bringing their kids in there thinking that they're going to promote their children to be diverse and accepting.
[01:38:48.866 --> 01:38:51.648]  They're really getting kids to lower their own goals.
[01:38:52.008 --> 01:38:52.668]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:39:20.987 --> 01:39:36.925]  But beyond that, and I commend you for what you guys have done, the great research, this is being pushed all over national news, all over BBC, as the most wonderful thing since sliced bread, and then you go look at where it comes from and who runs it, it's literal sexualization, nambla,
[01:39:37.506 --> 01:39:47.812]  You know, we're going to educate your kids about our lifestyle that is just obese, big, fat, gross men dressed as women, telling your kids to sit on their laps and touch them.
[01:39:47.812 --> 01:39:54.356]  I mean, this is the most obscene, sickening, over-the-top garbage, and it's given total air superiority by the corporate media.
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:40:06.733]  Right, and if I'm a pervert, I'm looking at these wrong-headed parents who are just in love with the idea of diversity, and that's their highest value, that they can't even see the perversity they're exposing their kids to.
[01:40:06.733 --> 01:40:11.218]  And if I'm a pervert, I'm like, look at these parents, their guards are completely lowered.
[01:40:11.218 --> 01:40:14.723]  I think I'll go hang around at Drag Queen Story Hour, maybe volunteer.
[01:40:15.664 --> 01:40:29.519]  It's just such a bad idea, and it's got the government stamp of approval on it down here in Houston and other places, and the American Library Association colluding with librarians and even in their own language using words like,
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:37.227]  He's a secret agent pushing drag queen story hour and LGBTQ content into the library.
[01:40:37.227 --> 01:40:41.671]  He's a secret agent and he's already demonically influenced leftists.
[01:40:41.671 --> 01:40:44.834]  They just know their God makes them feel powerful and do bad things.
[01:40:44.834 --> 01:40:49.018]  So the left is being seduced into actual psychic vampirism over children.
[01:40:50.936 --> 01:40:52.037]  Hold on a second.
[01:40:52.037 --> 01:40:54.019]  We'll do one more segment with you.
[01:40:54.019 --> 01:40:55.641]  Your cell phone is going out here on us.
[01:40:55.641 --> 01:40:58.724]  We appreciate you coming on on short notice.
[01:40:58.724 --> 01:41:00.106]  I want to fly you and your whole great crew.
[01:41:13.604 --> 01:41:23.493]  I've got investigators in New York and other areas of Texas on the ground.
[01:41:23.493 --> 01:41:32.742]  We're getting intel that is absolutely beyond evil on this whole network, so I would like to get you in studio
[01:41:33.803 --> 01:41:36.185]  So that we can actually talk about what you've done.
[01:41:36.185 --> 01:41:41.489]  But as we go to break, if your cell phone's not breaking up, let me ask you this question.
[01:41:41.489 --> 01:41:47.894]  We took a lot of investigation because the guy was wearing a clown, a demon clown outfit.
[01:41:47.894 --> 01:41:53.318]  How did you discover that the demon clown, William Travis Deas, was a convicted child rapist?
[01:41:54.747 --> 01:41:59.671]  Well, through his own social media, we knew there were things wrong.
[01:41:59.671 --> 01:42:09.678]  We found that he was a prostitute and then porn, like as a trans porn star, and through his own admission on Oracle, he wrote, so we were looking more into the
[01:42:09.858 --> 01:42:23.481]  And then there was a post by his mother, and just comparing some background checks that we ran with the name he's going by now, and addresses and phone numbers, we did searches on those.
[01:42:23.481 --> 01:42:25.721]  That tied him to the other name.
[01:42:25.721 --> 01:42:30.562]  Well, then we needed the face to match the name and some proof, and mostly social media.
[01:42:30.562 --> 01:42:36.243]  I'd say Google is a powerful tool, and I think maybe the library ought to learn how to use it.
[01:42:37.901 --> 01:42:40.683]  And again, law enforcement's not doing it.
[01:42:40.683 --> 01:42:43.345]  A mother, a grandmother's doing it.
[01:42:43.345 --> 01:42:44.006]  And we're doing it.
[01:42:44.006 --> 01:42:45.087]  That's why Lister's supporting us.
[01:42:45.087 --> 01:42:46.428]  It's so critical supporting you.
[01:42:46.428 --> 01:42:50.831]  I mean, I want to talk to you about putting you in charge of a whole nationwide operation.
[01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:54.894]  Because I don't have that much money, but I've got enough money, I think, to bring down a couple hundred of these guys.
[01:42:54.894 --> 01:42:56.816]  And we're coming after you, pedophiles.
[01:42:58.191 --> 01:43:02.515]  Getting your protein has never been easier with InfoWars Life Protein Bars.

[01:43:57.563 --> 01:44:02.225]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[01:44:02.225 --> 01:44:06.467]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[01:44:06.467 --> 01:44:14.410]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[01:44:14.410 --> 01:44:17.531]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[01:44:17.531 --> 01:44:21.013]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[01:44:22.345 --> 01:44:25.467]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[01:44:25.467 --> 01:44:27.529]  We are the power structure.
[01:44:27.529 --> 01:44:29.130]  We are the inventors.
[01:44:29.130 --> 01:44:30.911]  We are the trailblazers.
[01:44:30.911 --> 01:44:34.293]  And the globalists understand that.
[01:44:34.293 --> 01:44:41.418]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[01:44:41.418 --> 01:44:45.221]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[01:44:46.267 --> 01:44:55.372]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have storewide free shipping at 50% off at importastore.com.
[01:44:55.372 --> 01:44:58.634]  Something everybody should take advantage of.
[01:44:58.634 --> 01:45:04.397]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[01:45:04.397 --> 01:45:05.858]  So I need to make them strong now.
[01:45:05.858 --> 01:45:07.619]  Now I can be there for my children.
[01:45:07.619 --> 01:45:09.460]  Now I can make them strong.
[01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:11.100]  Now I can instruct them.
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:13.822]  Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[01:45:13.902 --> 01:45:19.045]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:45:19.045 --> 01:45:24.648]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:45:24.648 --> 01:45:28.270]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:33.253]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[01:45:33.253 --> 01:45:40.057]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[01:45:40.137 --> 01:45:43.921]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[01:45:43.921 --> 01:45:51.528]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:45:51.528 --> 01:45:58.134]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[01:45:59.110 --> 01:46:01.451]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:46:01.451 --> 01:46:08.074]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:46:08.074 --> 01:46:12.556]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.

[01:46:53.212 --> 01:47:01.314]  From InfoWarsLife at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:47:01.314 --> 01:47:03.955]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:32.381 --> 01:47:37.291]  You know, there's an analogy I want to engage here.
[01:47:37.291 --> 01:47:42.100]  Everybody knows about sometimes a thread comes out of your sweater or your shirt.
[01:47:43.730 --> 01:47:48.133]  If you pull that thread, the whole sweater or the whole shirt just unravels.
[01:47:48.133 --> 01:47:50.595]  The whole arm comes off.
[01:47:50.595 --> 01:47:54.738]  And I'm telling you, we've already blown globalist operations across the planet.
[01:47:54.738 --> 01:47:56.559]  We've already defeated Hillary together.
[01:47:56.559 --> 01:47:58.361]  We've already devastated the EU.
[01:47:58.361 --> 01:47:59.922]  We've done it together.
[01:47:59.922 --> 01:48:02.664]  This broadcast is the detonator.
[01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:04.570]  And the enemy knows that.
[01:48:04.570 --> 01:48:15.321]  And I'm telling you, I smell it spiritually, I see it intellectually, I know it politically, I absolutely have documented it through the criminology, that this is
[01:48:17.259 --> 01:48:27.722]  A worldwide pedophile cult that many top globalists are involved in, and their Renfields, their Vanguard, are sex offenders, child rapists.
[01:48:27.722 --> 01:48:33.543]  I mean, we mean brutal, aggravated, grabbing kids, kidnapping them, dragging them into a shed, raping them.
[01:48:33.543 --> 01:48:35.824]  I've got the police reports.
[01:48:35.824 --> 01:48:36.864]  And that's what they got caught for.
[01:48:36.864 --> 01:48:40.985]  You might get caught for one in a hundred.
[01:48:40.985 --> 01:48:43.946]  And you go to these events, you cover these events, it's men literally going,
[01:48:46.101 --> 01:48:48.303]  I mean, they are so scary.
[01:48:48.303 --> 01:48:53.788]  And they are coming after your kids and they mean business.
[01:48:53.788 --> 01:48:55.449]  And that's why mayors are defending them.
[01:48:55.449 --> 01:49:00.954]  It's why the AP and Reuters and CNN are saying it's great.
[01:49:00.954 --> 01:49:07.079]  It's because this is their religion and their bosses are involved.
[01:49:07.079 --> 01:49:08.681]  And more is going to come out.
[01:49:09.718 --> 01:49:15.461]  The problem is they show up at your school unannounced, they show up at the library, and they pull up in vans with other people.
[01:49:15.461 --> 01:49:19.063]  They're guarding who they are.
[01:49:19.063 --> 01:49:22.405]  So it takes investigations to do this.
[01:49:22.405 --> 01:49:37.414]  But as people on the ground, like our guest who's doing an incredible job, expose all of this, as this is done, they are going to get scarier and scarier and scarier and know that we're on their tail.
[01:49:37.414 --> 01:49:39.015]  Tracy Shannon, you were getting into
[01:49:41.634 --> 01:49:48.783]  You're there with your grandbaby about to be born at the hospital on a cell phone about how you and others did the tracking, found who they were.
[01:49:48.783 --> 01:49:51.326]  And I know you're working on other leads right now, so are we.
[01:49:51.326 --> 01:49:54.069]  But man, I tell you, these are some bold folks.
[01:49:54.069 --> 01:49:57.633]  But from what I know about pedophiles, they're fiends.
[01:49:57.633 --> 01:49:58.554]  It's like a crackhead.
[01:49:58.554 --> 01:50:01.077]  They can't stop going after children.
[01:50:03.664 --> 01:50:05.224]  I think there's just no boundaries.
[01:50:05.224 --> 01:50:06.405]  There's just no boundaries.
[01:50:06.405 --> 01:50:08.405]  And there's some arrogance.
[01:50:08.405 --> 01:50:14.287]  And especially down here in Houston, there's this attitude that you can't even scrutinize us.
[01:50:14.287 --> 01:50:18.508]  And I think that applies to all of the LGBTQ community.
[01:50:18.508 --> 01:50:21.589]  I'm not painting them with a broad brush that they're all pedophiles.
[01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:24.310]  The LGBT community is now P. They're supporting the pedophiles.
[01:50:25.447 --> 01:50:42.790]  Yeah, I mean, I've been getting some calls from some that are very upset that people are not taking a position against Drag Queen Story Hour or that people covered for these pedophiles and that, like, a restaurant called Hamburger Mary's here, the manager actually said, we're scrubbing our social media of any associated
[01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:43.671]  We're good to go.
[01:51:06.907 --> 01:51:10.148]  You do background checks on teachers?
[01:51:10.148 --> 01:51:12.648]  You do them on cops?
[01:51:12.648 --> 01:51:15.029]  I have background checks, yeah.
[01:51:15.029 --> 01:51:23.211]  I mean, to volunteer at a food pantry that I volunteer at, I have to do a background check because it's run by a church and children are in churches.
[01:51:23.211 --> 01:51:30.132]  So I have to do it routinely every year for all kinds of organizations my kids are in and that I volunteer in.
[01:51:30.132 --> 01:51:32.612]  Everyone should be doing them when there's children involved.
[01:51:32.612 --> 01:51:33.353]  Absolutely.
[01:51:33.353 --> 01:51:34.333]  I don't care who you are.
[01:51:36.073 --> 01:51:37.514]  That's not being discriminating.
[01:51:37.514 --> 01:51:38.795]  That's just common sense.
[01:51:38.795 --> 01:51:40.096]  We do it to protect the children.
[01:51:40.096 --> 01:51:41.477]  It should be the policy.
[01:51:41.477 --> 01:51:49.803]  It should be strictly followed, in addition to looking at social media of these volunteers, because they may not be appropriate to be around children at all.
[01:51:49.803 --> 01:51:57.208]  Now what's happened so far, because I've seen different reports, but you guys have gotten the story time with sex offenders canceled for now?
[01:51:58.581 --> 01:51:59.242]  We're good to go.
[01:52:15.573 --> 01:52:17.315]  Well you gotta go in with a hidden camera.
[01:52:17.315 --> 01:52:17.815]  No, exactly.
[01:52:17.815 --> 01:52:19.156]  They're in a public venue.
[01:52:37.711 --> 01:52:42.354]  And instead of running a swingers club with consenting adults, those get shut down.
[01:52:42.354 --> 01:52:46.236]  This is literally an event for grooming children, and they're trying to keep you from filming it.
[01:52:47.338 --> 01:52:56.724]  Well, get this, they want to screen the people who cover it, and they also have a binder with people that they use, people they call known infiltrators, like myself.
[01:52:56.724 --> 01:52:59.825]  They circulated this nasty fire about me.
[01:52:59.825 --> 01:53:00.486]  Let's say that again.
[01:53:00.486 --> 01:53:01.907]  Known infiltrators.
[01:53:01.907 --> 01:53:05.829]  Grandmothers that don't want children sitting on the lap of convicted pedophiles.
[01:53:05.829 --> 01:53:07.550]  They've got to stop you, the infiltrator.
[01:53:08.595 --> 01:53:20.525]  That's right, and also they circulated a flyer calling me a predator because I went in there with a rainbow wig and heavy makeup and recorded drag queen story.
[01:53:20.525 --> 01:53:23.648]  Don't worry Tracy, the cavalry is on the way.
[01:53:25.219 --> 01:53:25.839]  Thank you.
[01:53:25.839 --> 01:53:29.461]  We can use it here and everywhere.
[01:53:29.461 --> 01:53:31.842]  Well, have you noticed, Alex?
[01:53:31.842 --> 01:53:32.402]  Have you noticed?
[01:53:32.402 --> 01:53:33.363]  Oh, you're mayor.
[01:53:33.363 --> 01:53:35.604]  Obviously, this is a bad person.
[01:53:35.604 --> 01:53:36.904]  He's probably been compromised.
[01:53:36.904 --> 01:53:38.085]  I mean, obviously, more ways than one.
[01:53:38.085 --> 01:53:39.885]  From what I know from law enforcement.
[01:53:39.885 --> 01:53:41.426]  Well, I'm going to stop right there.
[01:53:41.426 --> 01:53:44.527]  People, if you're looking at the Super Bowl, I'm just going to stop right there.
[01:53:44.527 --> 01:53:47.949]  But, oh yeah, we know everything, basically.
[01:53:47.949 --> 01:53:54.572]  Think about how this whole thing is so coordinated, though, all over the world, introducing children to giant fat sex predators.
[01:53:56.633 --> 01:54:04.818]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know who's behind the coordination globally, besides maybe the Antichrist.
[01:54:04.818 --> 01:54:07.940]  But have you noticed it's all the same nomenclature, all the same words?
[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:10.041]  Well, let me tell you who's behind a lot of it.
[01:54:10.041 --> 01:54:11.082]  Let me play this for you.
[01:54:11.082 --> 01:54:17.585]  This is Desmond is Amazing, the little kid whose parents don't work, but he performs at gay clubs from age 8 to 11.
[01:54:17.585 --> 01:54:23.129]  Desmond is Amazing talks about taking ketamine, that is a mass gang rape drug, and then he's in a video with
[01:54:24.384 --> 01:54:24.984]  Anyone can do drag!
[01:54:42.774 --> 01:54:43.835]  Everyone can do drag.
[01:54:43.835 --> 01:54:44.615]  Everyone can do drag.
[01:54:44.615 --> 01:54:45.836]  Your mom can do drag.
[01:54:45.836 --> 01:54:46.056]  1-4-8-8.
[01:54:46.056 --> 01:54:47.216]  Oh, sorry.
[01:54:47.216 --> 01:54:51.038]  It was just an off track, okay?
[01:54:51.038 --> 01:54:51.479]  1-4-8-8.
[01:54:51.479 --> 01:54:52.179]  It was only $400 on.
[01:54:52.179 --> 01:54:54.660]  There's no genders.
[01:54:54.660 --> 01:54:57.182]  You can be male, female, any or none.
[01:54:57.182 --> 01:54:57.662]  Poor baby.
[01:54:57.662 --> 01:54:58.322]  Poor prisoner.
[01:54:58.322 --> 01:54:59.563]  Only U.S.
[01:54:59.563 --> 01:55:02.964]  people can have a bunch of made-up genders.
[01:55:02.964 --> 01:55:03.865]  That's not true at all.
[01:55:03.865 --> 01:55:04.805]  No, no, no.
[01:55:04.805 --> 01:55:05.446]  Oh, my God.
[01:55:05.446 --> 01:55:07.387]  Hitler was right.
[01:55:07.387 --> 01:55:07.587]  What?
[01:55:09.053 --> 01:55:10.074]  That's a child!
[01:55:26.388 --> 01:55:32.174]  I guess age 10 then, with a famous quote, drag queen, a man, and the child performs at adult facilities.
[01:55:32.174 --> 01:55:33.135]  What has this world come to?
[01:55:33.135 --> 01:55:37.079]  Imagine you walk into a Thomas bar and there's a 10-year-old girl there.
[01:55:37.079 --> 01:55:38.360]  You'd be like, what the hell?
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:40.342]  Oh, but it's a little boy, so it's okay.
[01:55:40.342 --> 01:55:41.383]  You know, gut up, mister.
[01:55:41.383 --> 01:55:43.145]  And here's another clip.
[01:55:43.145 --> 01:55:49.871]  Here's Desmond is Amazing with the convicted murderer that chopped up his boyfriend, and who is the guy that launched this whole thing.
[01:55:49.871 --> 01:55:50.172]  Here it is.
[01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:55.393]  This is the Desmond is Amazing episode.
[01:55:55.393 --> 01:56:03.239]  Our special guest, the amazing Desmond, all the way from Brooklyn, drove through rush hour traffic to get here.
[01:56:03.239 --> 01:56:05.181]  Hot, hot, hot tea.
[01:56:05.181 --> 01:56:10.105]  It's 9.40pm and he doesn't have to go to school tomorrow.
[01:56:10.105 --> 01:56:12.447]  Alright, that's a date.
[01:56:13.394 --> 01:56:14.755]  I can fill in some of the gaps for you.
[01:56:14.755 --> 01:56:15.655]  What did you make of that?
[01:56:35.071 --> 01:56:37.832]  Well, I've seen that before.
[01:56:37.832 --> 01:56:41.293]  It's entirely inappropriate what's happening with these kids.
[01:56:41.293 --> 01:56:48.635]  At DragCon, for example, where I've seen children as young as 18 months old dressed in drag being carried in by their parents.
[01:56:48.635 --> 01:56:50.296]  Their parents are completely insane.
[01:56:50.376 --> 01:56:52.098]  He's a victim!
[01:57:13.035 --> 01:57:18.538]  And just so you know, they put the kids that were in the mine cave on ketamine because it turns off pain and anxiety.
[01:57:18.538 --> 01:57:24.142]  Ketamine is used so that 15 guys can line up and wreck the hell out of somebody.
[01:57:24.142 --> 01:57:30.825]  So it's meant to make the muscles relax so they can literally rape the hell out of a kid and not have them go to the hospital.
[01:57:30.825 --> 01:57:31.646]  That's disgusting.
[01:57:33.150 --> 01:57:35.833]  It is disgusting, and I only learned about it researching.
[01:57:35.833 --> 01:57:37.434]  I'm like, what's this ketamine?
[01:57:37.434 --> 01:57:42.218]  Oh, that's what gay men take when up to 50 dudes line up and have sex with them.
[01:57:42.218 --> 01:57:42.698]  That's right.
[01:57:42.698 --> 01:57:45.240]  And little kids are on TV talking about it.
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:47.262]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:47.262 --> 01:57:49.324]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:57:49.324 --> 01:57:49.964]  Go ahead.
[01:57:49.964 --> 01:57:52.146]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[01:57:52.146 --> 01:57:55.189]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:57:56.019 --> 01:57:57.440]  It just gets old, man.
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:59.862]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:57:59.862 --> 01:58:02.183]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:58:02.183 --> 01:58:06.206]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:58:06.206 --> 01:58:09.508]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:58:09.508 --> 01:58:12.190]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:58:12.190 --> 01:58:13.550]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:14.671]  Us being shut down?
[01:58:14.671 --> 01:58:15.692]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:58:16.132 --> 01:58:17.213]  You know what, Alex?
[01:58:17.213 --> 01:58:18.573]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[01:58:18.573 --> 01:58:19.414]  Hey, Frank!
[01:58:19.414 --> 01:58:25.077]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:58:25.077 --> 01:58:29.579]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:58:29.579 --> 01:58:32.741]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:58:32.741 --> 01:58:33.201]  You understand?
[01:58:33.201 --> 01:58:34.842]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:58:34.842 --> 01:58:35.963]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:58:36.943 --> 01:58:42.546]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[01:58:42.546 --> 01:58:43.267]  Do you understand?
[01:58:43.267 --> 01:58:44.908]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:58:44.908 --> 01:58:46.369]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:59:06.545]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:59:06.545 --> 01:59:16.631]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:59:16.631 --> 01:59:25.176]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:59:25.996 --> 01:59:27.337]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:59:27.337 --> 01:59:28.497]  You must experience it.
[01:59:28.497 --> 01:59:30.478]  It is a total game changer.
[01:59:30.478 --> 01:59:35.500]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:59:35.500 --> 01:59:37.020]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:38.501]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:59:38.501 --> 01:59:45.183]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:59:45.183 --> 01:59:51.266]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[01:59:51.266 --> 01:59:53.967]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:57.557 --> 01:59:58.878]  We've got it.
[01:59:58.878 --> 02:00:04.683]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:00:04.683 --> 02:00:09.067]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:09.067 --> 02:00:14.711]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:20.818 --> 02:00:39.356]  So, here is the founder of Club Kids Movement, where men dress like children, men dress like clowns, men have sex with underage people, and here he is with his guest host, the same place they have the poor little kid on with them, loaned out by the parents.
[02:00:40.447 --> 02:00:47.991]  And now we've got something to show you, and we have to warn you ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[02:01:04.511 --> 02:01:18.259]  What we're going to show you is going to leave an impression on them, and we hope the impression will be that they grow up, if they're 3 or 4 or 5 years old, to become 7 or 8 year old drag queens and ballers.
[02:01:18.259 --> 02:01:22.661]  So when they've taken thousands of hits of X, taken all this ketamine, these guys have no brains.
[02:01:22.661 --> 02:01:25.683]  They're just vessels for the avatar.
[02:01:25.683 --> 02:01:28.545]  And that's what our research shows, that they're gone.
[02:01:28.545 --> 02:01:30.106]  They're demon possessed.
[02:01:31.035 --> 02:01:32.516]  And they want kids.
[02:01:32.516 --> 02:01:33.556]  That's the energy.
[02:01:33.556 --> 02:01:34.937]  And I'm telling you, folks, I've studied it.
[02:01:34.937 --> 02:01:35.818]  It's what they're into.
[02:01:35.818 --> 02:01:38.639]  And then they get mayors and other people corrupted and into it.
[02:01:38.639 --> 02:01:45.683]  Then they blackmail city officials and their armies of sex workers.
[02:01:45.683 --> 02:01:49.045]  And then once they blackmail you, then this is what they do.
[02:01:49.045 --> 02:01:50.866]  And then they take control of your city.
[02:01:50.866 --> 02:01:52.207]  And then they say, well, what do you want?
[02:01:52.207 --> 02:01:53.268]  We want access to children.
[02:01:54.198 --> 02:01:57.482]  So in closing, I want to invite Tracy Shannon back soon in studio.
[02:01:57.482 --> 02:01:59.144]  Now you got that grandbaby coming.
[02:01:59.144 --> 02:02:01.327]  I appreciate you fighting back.
[02:02:01.327 --> 02:02:02.348]  I wouldn't even say you're a hero.
[02:02:02.348 --> 02:02:04.631]  You just have life instincts.
[02:02:04.631 --> 02:02:05.993]  You have life force.
[02:02:05.993 --> 02:02:06.693]  And we salute you.
[02:02:06.693 --> 02:02:07.695]  Any other points you'd like to make?
[02:02:09.848 --> 02:02:11.048]  No, that's it for now.
[02:02:11.048 --> 02:02:17.490]  We're going to continue to work on busting these drag queens' story hours until they're down and stay down.
[02:02:17.490 --> 02:02:19.650]  And not just in Houston, Texas either.
[02:02:19.650 --> 02:02:21.311]  We're going to take them all down.
[02:02:21.311 --> 02:02:24.912]  It's inappropriate for children and it will not be tolerated.
[02:02:24.912 --> 02:02:34.074]  It's inappropriate to have convicted child rapists, just two that you researched out of the ten or so convicted child rapists, and it's inappropriate for little kids to be handed over to them?
[02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:37.611]  Yeah, it's all inappropriate.
[02:02:37.611 --> 02:02:43.458]  Even if we didn't find a pedophile, convicted pedophile, this would be inappropriate.
[02:02:43.458 --> 02:02:50.826]  Children do not have the job to validate adult choices, adult behaviors, and adult identities.
[02:02:50.826 --> 02:02:55.371]  If that's their identity, they need to get comfortable with it on their own and don't drag children into it.
[02:02:56.787 --> 02:02:57.688]  I agree.
[02:02:57.688 --> 02:03:01.812]  You've been out there in person around him, and we've gone and covered it too.
[02:03:01.812 --> 02:03:02.913]  It's very demonic.
[02:03:02.913 --> 02:03:06.857]  Like, if I went to a Halloween party and people were dressed like that, I'd say, what are you, like, vampire clowns?
[02:03:06.857 --> 02:03:11.922]  And it's weird men in makeup going... I can't even make the faces.
[02:03:11.922 --> 02:03:13.744]  I mean, they act so demonic, so hateful.
[02:03:15.476 --> 02:03:27.865]  Well, I mean, we have parents pushing their kids towards them, and the kid's trying to run away and crying, and then the mother pushing the little boy back over to the parent and goes, well, what the hell is wrong with you today?
[02:03:27.865 --> 02:03:35.691]  I mean, it's just horrible how wrong-headed the parents are, that they're squashing their kids' natural instincts to run from something that scares them.
[02:03:35.691 --> 02:03:36.532]  You're bad children!
[02:03:36.532 --> 02:03:39.394]  You don't want to go to a convicted child rapist dressed like a demon clown?
[02:03:39.394 --> 02:03:40.915]  What's wrong with you?
[02:03:40.915 --> 02:03:41.856]  You're not liberal!
[02:03:41.856 --> 02:03:43.818]  And then you go further, they're still defending it.
[02:03:43.818 --> 02:03:44.999]  It's a spiritual delusion.
[02:03:58.444 --> 02:04:07.170]  They're defending it, and we want to get to the bottom of why they're defending it and who's defending it, who's funding it.
[02:04:07.170 --> 02:04:10.273]  There could be more here, like you're saying.
[02:04:10.273 --> 02:04:13.175]  There could be a much bigger story here.
[02:04:13.175 --> 02:04:17.398]  So we're not going to stop looking, and I've heard other people speculate
[02:04:17.498 --> 02:04:28.432]  The same thing that you're speculating, that there's, you know, some really sinister reasons why... This is a pedophile network, literally like an anglerfish, coming to get the children, and that's why it's so protected.
[02:04:28.432 --> 02:04:30.535]  That's why they call you a predator.
[02:04:30.535 --> 02:04:35.321]  That's why they say, we're secret agents against you, because they're running an operation.
[02:04:36.022 --> 02:04:40.163]  And there's a lot of money and a lot of power to do this, and this is their offensive.
[02:04:40.163 --> 02:04:41.824]  All right, MassResistance.org.
[02:04:41.824 --> 02:04:42.744]  MassResistance.org.
[02:04:42.744 --> 02:04:44.105]  Everybody share that link.
[02:04:44.105 --> 02:04:48.126]  Tracy Shannon, we salute you, and I need you here not next week, but the week after.
[02:04:48.126 --> 02:04:49.346]  Please come to Austin.
[02:04:49.346 --> 02:04:50.807]  Please strategize to save the children.
[02:04:50.807 --> 02:04:51.647]  God bless you.
[02:04:51.647 --> 02:04:54.148]  Hell, the governor of Virginia says we'll kill babies after they're born.
[02:04:56.323 --> 02:05:01.428]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[02:05:01.428 --> 02:05:04.351]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.

[02:06:06.641 --> 02:06:07.982]  Here's my message to you.
[02:06:07.982 --> 02:06:15.909]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:15.909 --> 02:06:19.212]  Du hast, du hast mich.
[02:06:19.212 --> 02:06:25.158]  Du hast, du hast mich.
[02:06:25.158 --> 02:06:29.842]  Du, du hast, du hast mich.
[02:06:56.408 --> 02:06:58.550]  People are so easy to defeat.
[02:06:58.550 --> 02:07:00.872]  The average man's too busy playing fantasy football.
[02:07:00.872 --> 02:07:04.395]  Knack and top in front of his buddies.
[02:07:04.395 --> 02:07:07.418]  Little pot-bellied vampire goblins.
[02:07:07.418 --> 02:07:09.319]  Hobbling around.
[02:07:09.319 --> 02:07:12.642]  Go after our children.
[02:07:12.642 --> 02:07:18.608]  We ought to air that piece, that Bon Iver piece they did years ago that was so viral it had like 50 million views or whatever.
[02:07:18.608 --> 02:07:21.250]  We ought to play that today.
[02:07:21.250 --> 02:07:23.372]  I want to open the phones up about
[02:07:25.282 --> 02:07:36.677]  Gangs of pedophiles disguised as clowns being given access to elementary schools, libraries, other facilities, in some cases without even telling parents.
[02:07:36.677 --> 02:07:42.244]  And the weirdo parents that are bringing their kids to it, they're all involved in this dark energy.
[02:07:43.427 --> 02:07:47.691]  And what did you just think of that last hour of incredible information?
[02:07:47.691 --> 02:07:49.092]  Your children belong to us.
[02:07:49.092 --> 02:07:51.174]  We're going to corrupt them.
[02:07:51.174 --> 02:07:52.915]  We are child rapists.
[02:07:52.915 --> 02:07:53.716]  Give them to us.
[02:07:53.716 --> 02:07:55.197]  And the mayor's like, I like it.
[02:07:55.197 --> 02:08:00.422]  I'm going to protect it.
[02:08:00.422 --> 02:08:07.548]  You know, Houston was a safe zone for mass sex crimes and pedophilia during the last Super Bowl.
[02:08:11.263 --> 02:08:16.564]  And I was told that by federal and state law enforcement, high level.
[02:08:16.564 --> 02:08:25.886]  And I was told they weren't even able to get in there and stop it.
[02:08:25.886 --> 02:08:30.126]  And I was only told that because they knew I was covertly funding groups trying to infiltrate it.
[02:08:30.126 --> 02:08:35.007]  So I got visits.
[02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:38.088]  Was that two years ago?
[02:08:38.088 --> 02:08:39.368]  It all runs together now.
[02:08:44.898 --> 02:08:47.619]  You know, cops that actually investigate it end up dead.
[02:08:47.619 --> 02:08:51.560]  And it's not the little pot-bellied Renfields that kill them.
[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:53.501]  Use the allegory, Dracula shows up.
[02:08:53.501 --> 02:08:59.983]  Then I guess we just let them run everything then.
[02:08:59.983 --> 02:09:01.183]  I guess that's it.
[02:09:01.183 --> 02:09:01.984]  They're better than us.
[02:09:01.984 --> 02:09:04.084]  They're stronger than us.
[02:09:04.084 --> 02:09:07.625]  There's no men will stand up against them and do anything anymore.
[02:09:07.625 --> 02:09:10.747]  It's the little pot-bellied minions.
[02:09:10.747 --> 02:09:11.927]  To go out there and do whatever they want.
[02:09:14.571 --> 02:09:26.497]  Let me tell you, Dracula doesn't send anybody of any worth to these events as human shields or sandbags or suicide bombers, politically.
[02:09:26.497 --> 02:09:30.780]  He sends the worst he's got.
[02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:39.084]  Scum show, mind blown, so convicted that no one would ever listen to him.
[02:09:39.084 --> 02:09:40.365]  But I'll tell you something right now.
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:50.788]  The currency of the world government is babies being harvested and little kids being tortured.
[02:09:50.788 --> 02:10:07.001]  And we sit here with states passing laws to kill babies after they're born, and we sit here with the pedophile armies rising against us, and these arrogant leftist city councils drunk on the blood of the innocents.
[02:10:07.001 --> 02:10:08.743]  And it just becomes a repeat of the Bible, doesn't it?
[02:10:12.381 --> 02:10:19.444]  Drunk on the blood of children, the Antichrist is.
[02:10:19.444 --> 02:10:22.805]  And you look at these... I mean, if you saw these people walking down the street, you'd recoil.
[02:10:22.805 --> 02:10:26.107]  I can't even make the faces they make because they're so demonic.
[02:10:26.107 --> 02:10:31.769]  But it's just like a... Let me have time with your children now.
[02:10:31.769 --> 02:10:35.930]  Give me your children.
[02:10:35.930 --> 02:10:37.691]  Give them to me now.
[02:10:37.691 --> 02:10:40.652]  You will give them to me.
[02:10:40.652 --> 02:10:42.053]  Or I'll call you racist.
[02:10:47.657 --> 02:10:58.666]  You think that guy only raped a six-year-old and got caught a decade ago and went to jail for a few years?
[02:10:58.666 --> 02:11:02.969]  That's an inductee right there.
[02:11:02.969 --> 02:11:05.031]  That's Renfield.
[02:11:05.031 --> 02:11:08.794]  A demon posing as a woman.
[02:11:08.794 --> 02:11:11.296]  A woman that gives life, that nurtures babies.
[02:11:11.296 --> 02:11:17.141]  And these poor babies, the last thing they see in the inner hell is men dressed as women.
[02:11:19.605 --> 02:11:30.270]  The last thing they see is they're hacked up and torn into pieces and as their blood is slovenly licked into the mouths.
[02:11:30.270 --> 02:11:33.132]  And no men will stand against them.
[02:11:33.132 --> 02:11:46.418]  And when the men watching this show stand before God, God's gonna say, I don't know you.
[02:11:46.418 --> 02:11:47.999]  Because you wouldn't protect children
[02:11:50.017 --> 02:11:54.099]  Trump pedophiles dressed like clowns?
[02:11:54.099 --> 02:11:55.760]  That's how it goes down?
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:12:04.043]  That's how it all ends?
[02:12:04.043 --> 02:12:12.507]  That's who wrangles your children into the trucks, into the vans.
[02:12:15.461 --> 02:12:20.124]  And they want your children not to run when they're in the disguises and the van pulls up.
[02:12:20.124 --> 02:12:29.090]  They want them to have already been at story time five or six times, so they've learned to stop just long enough to be grabbed off that front yard because the kid didn't listen.
[02:12:29.090 --> 02:12:30.311]  Mom's asleep inside.
[02:12:30.311 --> 02:12:32.212]  She worked two shifts.
[02:12:32.212 --> 02:12:34.934]  And it's like, you're in the van now.
[02:12:34.934 --> 02:12:35.834]  Bye bye.
[02:12:35.834 --> 02:12:38.076]  Get the clown.
[02:12:38.076 --> 02:12:39.837]  Come on over here, Georgie.
[02:12:39.837 --> 02:12:40.577]  Oh, your boat.
[02:12:40.577 --> 02:12:42.919]  I got your boat right here.
[02:12:42.919 --> 02:12:44.660]  Just reach in and get your boat, Georgie.
[02:12:47.722 --> 02:12:48.582]  What's down there?
[02:12:48.582 --> 02:12:51.664]  Oh, there's clowns, popcorn.
[02:12:51.664 --> 02:12:54.025]  It's all down there, Georgie.
[02:12:54.025 --> 02:12:58.507]  Just stick your arm in here and I'm gonna rip it off.
[02:12:58.507 --> 02:13:00.207]  But Georgie's lucky, actually.
[02:13:00.207 --> 02:13:07.111]  In Stephen King's little vision, the old Stephen King kind of letting in a little something.
[02:13:07.111 --> 02:13:13.033]  Oh, Stephen King, what a nice person Stephen King is.
[02:13:13.033 --> 02:13:17.215]  He temporarily opposes anyone against drag queen story time.
[02:13:17.984 --> 02:13:19.985]  You didn't know that?
[02:13:19.985 --> 02:13:24.407]  Stephen King is a good pal.
[02:13:24.407 --> 02:13:30.470]  And he doesn't like President Trump and he doesn't like me.
[02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:37.833]  But he can write all those books about what goes on down there with the clowns.
[02:13:37.833 --> 02:13:40.134]  The clowns that torture your children to death.
[02:13:41.437 --> 02:13:43.858]  For a big, fat spider.
[02:13:43.858 --> 02:13:46.560]  See, Get the Clown is just a angler fish.
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:50.622]  It's just a finger of a big spider down a hole.
[02:13:50.622 --> 02:13:53.824]  And it sends this up to say, Hey, Georgie.
[02:13:53.824 --> 02:13:55.185]  Sit on my lap, Georgie.
[02:13:55.185 --> 02:13:57.486]  Touch my beard, Georgie.
[02:13:57.486 --> 02:14:00.808]  And Georgie, it's a free world universe.
[02:14:00.808 --> 02:14:10.073]  Stick your hand in this dark hole, Georgie, and I'm gonna show you that you'll float.
[02:14:13.138 --> 02:14:14.640]  All tell you it's their religion.
[02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:16.261]  And they're going to get your kids.
[02:14:16.261 --> 02:14:17.562]  They're going to get them with vaccines.
[02:14:17.562 --> 02:14:18.724]  They're going to get them with fluoride.
[02:14:18.724 --> 02:14:20.425]  They're going to get them with GMO.
[02:14:20.425 --> 02:14:21.867]  They're going to get them with a culture.
[02:14:21.867 --> 02:14:23.488]  They're going to get them with the iPhones.
[02:14:23.488 --> 02:14:26.992]  All because they couldn't kill them before they were born or right when they were born.
[02:14:26.992 --> 02:14:28.433]  But that's even better, you see.
[02:14:28.433 --> 02:14:33.438]  Let a child grow a little, have some love, have some parents, and be a good little person.
[02:14:33.438 --> 02:14:35.520]  And then they can get them in a dark pit.
[02:14:39.295 --> 02:14:54.865]  The energy these demons suck off your child it's so much better than just giving him cancer because you know the parents are there when the child's dying from the cancer from the vaccine and so they still have love it's just not as special but to have them in those dungeons all alone

[02:16:26.428 --> 02:16:30.349]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.349 --> 02:16:31.889]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:31.889 --> 02:16:34.850]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.

[02:16:54.773 --> 02:17:01.121]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:01.121 --> 02:17:04.164]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:04.164 --> 02:17:10.091]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:10.091 --> 02:17:13.876]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:13.876 --> 02:17:14.817]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:15.137 --> 02:17:16.137]  Who do we fight for?

[02:19:58.815 --> 02:20:01.424]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:41.363 --> 02:20:42.784]  The Boeing 737 MAX 8-9.
[02:20:42.784 --> 02:20:44.245]  You name it.
[02:20:44.245 --> 02:20:48.487]  I'm not a rocket scientist.
[02:20:48.487 --> 02:20:51.608]  I've made some calls to pilots I know that fly those.
[02:20:51.608 --> 02:20:55.270]  I talked to the pilot on a Southwest flight where the plane was one of those.
[02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:58.932]  The very day that Trump grounded him, I was flying back from Mexico on one.
[02:20:58.932 --> 02:20:59.613]  Shot a video of it.
[02:20:59.613 --> 02:21:00.073]  We played here.
[02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:06.171]  And they said, yeah, these companies aren't training their pilots.
[02:21:06.171 --> 02:21:11.274]  It's an autopilot issue that when the sensor gets confused, you have to turn it off two buttons.
[02:21:11.274 --> 02:21:14.096]  People aren't being trained on that.
[02:21:14.096 --> 02:21:23.822]  Well, Boeing just came out minutes ago and said it was an issue of people not being properly trained that when the autopilot malfunctions to turn it off, they fight it instead.
[02:21:23.822 --> 02:21:25.563]  Now, I'm not a rocket scientist.
[02:21:25.563 --> 02:21:26.944]  I talked to the pilots.
[02:21:26.944 --> 02:21:29.625]  The system knew this a month ago.
[02:21:29.625 --> 02:21:30.286]  So what am I getting at?
[02:21:31.616 --> 02:21:34.437]  You get next month's news today.
[02:21:34.437 --> 02:21:36.637]  No matter how crazy it sounds, we're really getting at the truth.
[02:21:36.637 --> 02:21:39.517]  That's why they want us off the air.
[02:21:39.517 --> 02:21:42.018]  Over and over and over and over again.
[02:21:42.018 --> 02:21:43.718]  And I meant to cover this story for a week.
[02:21:43.718 --> 02:21:54.420]  You saw that flight that took off in England, and it was supposed to go to Germany, but it landed in Scotland.
[02:21:54.420 --> 02:21:57.421]  British Airways flight was supposed to go to Germany, went to Scotland.
[02:21:57.421 --> 02:21:58.801]  When I first saw that over a week ago,
[02:22:01.570 --> 02:22:07.051]  I said that's going to be an autopilot problem that they were given the course by the airport, by the airline.
[02:22:07.051 --> 02:22:07.932]  It was a mistake.
[02:22:07.932 --> 02:22:11.512]  The pilots didn't even look because those things take off and land themselves.
[02:22:11.512 --> 02:22:15.333]  And top pilots are saying this is very dangerous because now there's a real problem.
[02:22:15.333 --> 02:22:16.694]  People don't know how to fly the planes.
[02:22:16.694 --> 02:22:26.896]  Imagine you take off in London and you fly to Scotland, which is about the same distance from London to Germany, and you land.
[02:22:29.130 --> 02:22:33.912]  And the pilots don't even figure it out until they're on the ground.
[02:22:33.912 --> 02:22:36.013]  So it's the same thing.
[02:22:36.013 --> 02:22:39.754]  Not knocking third world countries, but they don't usually have the best pilots.
[02:22:39.754 --> 02:22:45.477]  You've had two third world countries, one African, one Asian, have the issue.
[02:22:45.477 --> 02:22:54.480]  They knew with this new software glitch a few years ago, that the sensor will show that you've lost power and that you are basically plunging.
[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:58.762]  And they think the plane's gone into a stall.
[02:23:01.021 --> 02:23:03.762]  And it puts the nose down.
[02:23:03.762 --> 02:23:05.543]  Or it puts the flaps up, it does a bunch of stuff.
[02:23:05.543 --> 02:23:09.605]  And then you fight it, I'm on a pilot, and everything goes haywire.
[02:23:09.605 --> 02:23:17.669]  So again, everybody knew about this in aviation, but the media wouldn't tell us for such a long time.
[02:23:17.669 --> 02:23:22.531]  They go, oh we gotta ground it all, oh Boeing sucks, America sucks, blah blah blah.
[02:23:22.531 --> 02:23:26.313]  Every other flight system, Airbus, you name it's got problems with the
[02:23:28.939 --> 02:23:30.880]  Manual override.
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:39.026]  It's got problems with the automated flight systems where you just set where you want to go and sit back and it takes care of it.
[02:23:39.026 --> 02:23:40.427]  And I'll go back to this.
[02:23:40.427 --> 02:23:46.210]  Everybody remember going back about 20 years ago, how rough flights were when you land or take off?
[02:23:46.210 --> 02:23:50.153]  Sometimes the planes slide all over the tarmac.
[02:23:50.153 --> 02:23:52.194]  And then suddenly that just stopped, didn't it?
[02:23:52.194 --> 02:23:56.277]  It's always such a smooth takeoff, such a smooth landing because it's a computer doing it.
[02:23:59.008 --> 02:24:04.994]  But what happens when the automated flight control goes bad?
[02:24:04.994 --> 02:24:07.095]  You're in big trouble.
[02:24:07.095 --> 02:24:09.978]  And the system always fights to cover it up.
[02:24:09.978 --> 02:24:18.806]  They knew exactly the problem a year ago when one of the 737-800s went down.
[02:24:18.806 --> 02:24:21.349]  And they knew right away what happened in Kenya.
[02:24:22.503 --> 02:24:26.384]  But they don't want to tell you, and they never do.
[02:24:26.384 --> 02:24:27.985]  That's the problem with self-driving cars.
[02:24:27.985 --> 02:24:29.166]  People can hack them.
[02:24:29.166 --> 02:24:30.286]  You don't know how to drive anymore.
[02:24:30.286 --> 02:24:32.547]  What if there's a mass outage in the system?
[02:24:32.547 --> 02:24:35.128]  What if there's a computer virus?
[02:24:35.128 --> 02:24:37.349]  It doesn't make us strong.
[02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:50.094]  So I think this should be looked at, but I think under law, as self-driving cars become ubiquitous, Mercedes, all of them are coming out where the car just does it, and if it thinks you're driving bad, or it thinks you're tired, it pulls over.
[02:24:50.094 --> 02:24:50.934]  There should be a law
[02:24:52.188 --> 02:24:57.550]  That half the time you've got to drive yourself completely.
[02:24:57.550 --> 02:25:00.150]  Because calculators have killed mathematics.
[02:25:00.150 --> 02:25:01.831]  All of this is making us weaker.
[02:25:01.831 --> 02:25:03.371]  We're stupider than ever.
[02:25:03.371 --> 02:25:05.892]  And it allows the people programming the automation.
[02:25:05.892 --> 02:25:10.154]  Imagine once we're totally dependent on computers and robots.
[02:25:10.154 --> 02:25:11.514]  Who programs them?
[02:25:11.514 --> 02:25:12.774]  The technocrats.
[02:25:12.774 --> 02:25:14.535]  And then they will rule everybody completely.
[02:25:17.677 --> 02:25:23.181]  Another big piece of news, as soon as I saw the photo and the video of this guy, he just looked like a scammer.
[02:25:23.181 --> 02:25:25.123]  I told my wife the other day, I said, I bet this is a scam.
[02:25:25.123 --> 02:25:30.547]  14-year-old boy in Ohio says he is the Illinois child who went missing in 2011.
[02:25:30.547 --> 02:25:37.873]  Turns out he's not, and made it up for attention.
[02:25:37.873 --> 02:25:39.794]  People ask, well, why would you do something like that?
[02:25:39.794 --> 02:25:41.535]  It hurt the families.
[02:25:41.535 --> 02:25:42.716]  See?
[02:25:42.716 --> 02:25:44.378]  But, oh, that's my psychosis.
[02:25:45.475 --> 02:25:46.435]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:25:46.435 --> 02:25:50.917]  I immediately don't believe the first thing I'm told.
[02:25:50.917 --> 02:25:53.798]  I'm a skeptic.
[02:25:53.798 --> 02:25:59.260]  But see, at first the police, not blaming them, really thought, well it must be him.
[02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:03.901]  You know, who would dare do something so hurtful like this?
[02:26:03.901 --> 02:26:10.504]  And it's liars like that that make us question every big public event, a lot of which turn out to be true, and then we look bad for questioning it.
[02:26:10.504 --> 02:26:11.364]  What are we supposed to do?
[02:26:12.651 --> 02:26:17.516]  I've never tried to hurt anybody in my life, didn't have it coming to them.
[02:26:17.516 --> 02:26:26.164]  You know, last segment, I had crew from all this building run up to me and say, that was really dark and really scary and really powerful.
[02:26:26.164 --> 02:26:36.815]  And you know, the children being tortured to death by devil worshipers and corruption and the Democrats that support after birth abortion, like the governor, Northam, and Senator Blumenthal, that's what I was mentioning there.
[02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:41.501]  Killing a baby after it's born is just the same as being a devil horse for killing them.
[02:26:41.501 --> 02:26:47.924]  If you study black magic and the occult and the globalists, they're into exactly what I described.
[02:26:47.924 --> 02:26:54.746]  You don't just think, again, Bram Stoker came up with Dracula where they've got minions that get the kids and then they got the Dracula above them.
[02:26:54.746 --> 02:26:59.228]  This is the real world that's happened over and over again in history.
[02:27:00.140 --> 02:27:04.924]  And now we've got predators on TV saying, your children belong to us.
[02:27:04.924 --> 02:27:06.625]  You're not going to stop us.
[02:27:06.625 --> 02:27:12.510]  They've declared their attack because the average man or woman in this country is asleep.
[02:27:12.510 --> 02:27:19.076]  And then a grandmother who works multiple jobs in Houston gets upset because she was trying to go have a Christian Bible hour there.
[02:27:19.076 --> 02:27:20.757]  And they said, no Christians allowed here.
[02:27:20.757 --> 02:27:22.498]  So she said, well, what's on the list?
[02:27:22.498 --> 02:27:23.419]  Oh, drag queens.
[02:27:23.419 --> 02:27:28.884]  What it really is is men dressed up like women, a bunch of which have pedophile rape conventions having their way with your kids.
[02:27:31.462 --> 02:27:37.886]  But see, she's a nurturing person that has her maternal instincts, so she can't help but do it, and they won't beat her.
[02:27:37.886 --> 02:27:43.589]  So we always talk about how the left-wings, they want women to be empowered.
[02:27:43.589 --> 02:27:45.650]  No, the globalists are scared of women.
[02:27:45.650 --> 02:27:51.273]  If women's instinct gets turned on right, and if women start demanding men act like men, it's over.
[02:27:51.273 --> 02:27:52.434]  Because women.
[02:27:52.434 --> 02:27:54.375]  Hitler said it, evil genius.
[02:27:54.375 --> 02:27:57.516]  First you've got the women.
[02:27:57.516 --> 02:27:59.317]  Then you've got the children.
[02:27:59.317 --> 02:28:00.138]  So follow the men.
[02:28:01.977 --> 02:28:10.221]  So it's time for women to stop leading this whole leftist Pied Piper, everybody into oblivion, leading the kids into the lake to drown.
[02:28:10.221 --> 02:28:15.044]  It's time for women to start leading and demand men act like men and men get out there and do something.
[02:28:15.044 --> 02:28:17.485]  Come back with your shields or on them.
[02:28:17.485 --> 02:28:19.826]  That's the Spartan statement.
[02:28:19.826 --> 02:28:24.328]  Because in a war, if you give up, you drop your weapons and run because you've been out.
[02:28:24.328 --> 02:28:29.771]  No, you come back with your shields or on them.
[02:28:29.771 --> 02:28:31.812]  With your shields or on them.
[02:28:32.939 --> 02:28:36.543]  With your shields, or on them?
[02:28:36.543 --> 02:28:41.748]  It is a shame that nine times out of ten, when it really comes to leadership, it's women.
[02:28:41.748 --> 02:28:46.834]  But that's what the globalists fear, is women's true leadership in the clutch.
[02:28:46.834 --> 02:28:50.417]  It's gonna be women that get men to get up off their damn asses.
[02:28:50.417 --> 02:28:52.559]  I'll give the number out, we'll take your call straight ahead, stay with us.

[02:30:04.753 --> 02:30:06.194]  Believe me, I know.
[02:30:06.194 --> 02:30:10.916]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:30:10.916 --> 02:30:13.978]  But thanks to Super Male Vitality at InfoWareStore.com.

[02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:24.567]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[02:32:44.934 --> 02:32:46.415]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:32:46.415 --> 02:32:53.116]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[02:32:59.737 --> 02:33:02.458]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.441 --> 02:33:21.825]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:21.825 --> 02:33:24.487]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.487 --> 02:33:28.670]  There was a big study that came out yesterday.
[02:33:28.670 --> 02:33:31.632]  I didn't get to it, but it's in my stack today again.
[02:33:31.632 --> 02:33:34.414]  They did a big national study of the U.S.
[02:33:34.414 --> 02:33:38.257]  and a record number of people said they don't believe in God or don't even have a religion.
[02:33:38.257 --> 02:33:39.759]  Well, the devil believes in you.
[02:33:41.297 --> 02:33:49.385]  I want to put the phones up though about drag queen story time that's really convicted pedophiles dressed up in clown outfits to protect their identity to have their way with your children.
[02:33:49.385 --> 02:33:53.208]  And who's orchestrating this all over the Western world?
[02:33:53.208 --> 02:33:54.529]  Another second one busted.
[02:33:54.529 --> 02:33:55.630]  I want your take on this.
[02:33:56.761 --> 02:34:00.842]  I want your take on so much more, but please give me your comment on that and whatever else you want to talk about.
[02:34:00.842 --> 02:34:01.982]  877-789-2539.
[02:34:01.982 --> 02:34:04.242]  Wide open phones.
[02:34:04.242 --> 02:34:05.383]  Anytime callers.
[02:34:05.383 --> 02:34:06.243]  Long time callers.
[02:34:06.243 --> 02:34:06.903]  First time callers.
[02:34:06.903 --> 02:34:07.563]  877-789-2539.
[02:34:07.563 --> 02:34:08.443]  877-789-Alex.
[02:34:08.443 --> 02:34:16.765]  I'm gonna go to your calls.
[02:34:16.765 --> 02:34:21.466]  But let me mention this, because I'm a little jealous of my good friend Pat Riley.
[02:34:21.466 --> 02:34:23.766]  He said he doesn't care I can say his new son's name on air.
[02:34:25.074 --> 02:34:27.995]  I have to admit, I came up with the name and he admits it's awesome sounding.
[02:34:27.995 --> 02:34:33.178]  Because Buck Jones sounds okay, but Buck Riley sounds like Space Captain, doesn't it?
[02:34:33.178 --> 02:34:37.140]  So the first son's a great guy, they didn't name him Buck Riley, that was my idea a few years ago.
[02:34:37.140 --> 02:34:39.621]  But the second son is named Buck Riley.
[02:34:39.621 --> 02:34:45.804]  And handsome young son, so's the other son, plays with my two-year-old daughter, they're both two.
[02:34:45.804 --> 02:34:47.425]  The older son, the first son.
[02:34:47.425 --> 02:34:49.686]  But he did name this one Buck.
[02:34:49.686 --> 02:34:50.867]  And long story short,
[02:34:52.785 --> 02:35:01.113]  Right as Beto O'Rourke was giving speeches, I was on the elliptical, like Tuesday, and the baby had just come.
[02:35:01.113 --> 02:35:08.840]  And Beto was at another event than this Al Sharpton one he did yesterday, saying, White people are bad!
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:10.121]  He talks like Bernie Sanders.
[02:35:10.121 --> 02:35:12.864]  His arms are all flapping around, not even controlled.
[02:35:12.864 --> 02:35:16.788]  I mean, it's just a joke what a fraud this guy is.
[02:35:18.416 --> 02:35:20.617]  And he's like, yes, we need to pay reparations.
[02:35:20.617 --> 02:35:23.237]  I will pass reparations if I become president.
[02:35:23.237 --> 02:35:26.358]  And I was looking at Buck Riley.
[02:35:26.358 --> 02:35:29.279]  And I've got four kids, one son, three daughters.
[02:35:29.279 --> 02:35:31.680]  I love the daughters.
[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:32.640]  They're just as good as a son.
[02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:34.021]  I think I'd treat them a lot better.
[02:35:35.083 --> 02:35:35.944]  I want a bookend.
[02:35:35.944 --> 02:35:37.465]  I want another son.
[02:35:37.465 --> 02:35:39.306]  A pee-pee baby is what we call it.
[02:35:39.306 --> 02:35:42.048]  And I just need that.
[02:35:42.048 --> 02:35:43.149]  And it's okay.
[02:35:43.149 --> 02:35:44.069]  I don't think I'm going to get one.
[02:35:44.069 --> 02:35:44.650]  God's been good to me.
[02:35:44.650 --> 02:35:52.915]  But the point is, is that I'm jealously looking at his handsome sons in a photo he sent me, the two-year-old next to the newborn baby.
[02:35:52.915 --> 02:35:59.320]  And it just hit me because as I'm looking at it, CNN's on and it's Beto talking about
[02:36:00.305 --> 02:36:06.328]  Beto, I know I call him Beto Pito, about, and the white people are bad and they need to pay money.
[02:36:06.328 --> 02:36:12.350]  And I'm looking at a newborn baby, and I'm looking at his other son who's two, and they haven't done anything.
[02:36:12.350 --> 02:36:22.055]  You wouldn't give them a misdemeanor, you wouldn't give them probation, you wouldn't give them a felony, but because they're white?
[02:36:22.055 --> 02:36:25.556]  Because, and by the way, I even asked Pat, I go, when's your family come here?
[02:36:25.556 --> 02:36:26.257]  After the Civil War.
[02:36:27.268 --> 02:36:33.830]  Irish, not, well you're Pat Riley, you're Irish, not even involved in slavery.
[02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:37.231]  Doesn't matter, he's white, so his kids are bad.
[02:36:37.231 --> 02:36:43.733]  That is so fundamentally racist and so fundamentally unfair and so flagrantly insane.
[02:36:43.733 --> 02:36:48.734]  It's like having convicted pedophiles at public schools having kids sit on their laps.
[02:36:48.734 --> 02:36:50.115]  This has got to stop!
[02:36:52.170 --> 02:36:56.254]  I don't care if a baby's black or Hispanic or Asian or what the hell.
[02:36:56.254 --> 02:37:01.800]  It hadn't done Jack Diddley squat!
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:05.243]  And I can't believe I've got to sit here and even say that in 2019.
[02:37:05.243 --> 02:37:06.584]  I'm getting sick of these people.
[02:37:06.584 --> 02:37:09.948]  And I'll do the math again for you.
[02:37:09.948 --> 02:37:13.251]  Somebody ought to do a mathematical, like PragerU ought to do a mathematical equation on this.
[02:37:13.251 --> 02:37:13.952]  They do the best job.
[02:37:17.461 --> 02:37:25.808]  Something like 70% of the people that live in this country now, their families, their ancestors came here sometime after the Civil War.
[02:37:25.808 --> 02:37:26.468]  That's just a fact.
[02:37:26.468 --> 02:37:27.909]  Look it up.
[02:37:27.909 --> 02:37:32.693]  So 70% of people in this country, their ancestors came here after slavery.
[02:37:32.693 --> 02:37:34.454]  Of course, it's cockamamie.
[02:37:34.454 --> 02:37:36.356]  If your dad had slaves, you shouldn't know.
[02:37:36.356 --> 02:37:39.818]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:37:39.818 --> 02:37:41.520]  But this is seven grandpas back.
[02:37:42.697 --> 02:37:45.799]  Then the South was something like 30 or 5 percent.
[02:37:45.799 --> 02:37:46.520]  Look it up.
[02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:49.222]  The Southern population was a lot smaller than the Northern population.
[02:37:49.222 --> 02:37:53.445]  Something like a third, if memory serves, in the Civil War.
[02:37:53.445 --> 02:37:54.886]  They had about a tenth of the factories.
[02:37:54.886 --> 02:37:57.248]  So that's a third of the population.
[02:37:57.248 --> 02:38:01.131]  So you've got a third of the population was here before the end of the Civil War in the South.
[02:38:02.793 --> 02:38:09.115]  You've got 70% that comes after, so it's a tiny portion already, and then 2% of the South has slaves.
[02:38:09.115 --> 02:38:19.077]  So it is a tiny group of people that have any ancestors associated with it, and then Beto says all white people owe money to black people.
[02:38:19.077 --> 02:38:21.698]  And they're not going to give black people money.
[02:38:21.698 --> 02:38:28.820]  They're going to just take money in some new race cult and put it into some program to brainwash blacks and turn them into SJWs.
[02:38:28.820 --> 02:38:29.620]  You know that!
[02:38:31.724 --> 02:38:34.546]  But what did the Nazis and the Soviets do?
[02:38:34.546 --> 02:38:49.293]  If you resisted the Soviets, especially under Stalin and Lenin before that, if somebody in your little town of 200 people resisted and say killed a Commissar, they would arrest the town leadership and take them to Siberia for 20 years.
[02:38:49.293 --> 02:38:50.494]  Or they might execute some people.
[02:38:52.284 --> 02:39:00.169]  And the Nazis, if one German soldier got killed in a town by one of the citizens, they would normally kill about 10 people.
[02:39:00.169 --> 02:39:06.112]  If an SS officer got killed, sometimes they would kill thousands in retribution.
[02:39:06.112 --> 02:39:10.735]  That is authoritarianism.
[02:39:10.735 --> 02:39:11.856]  Now, let's see if my math's right.
[02:39:11.856 --> 02:39:13.096]  They looked it up.
[02:39:13.096 --> 02:39:17.219]  21 million lived in the northern states and 9 million in the south.
[02:39:17.950 --> 02:39:23.213]  But 3.5 million were slaves, so that means about 6 million and 5, 5 point something million.
[02:39:23.213 --> 02:39:24.513]  So I was right, it's about a third.
[02:39:24.513 --> 02:39:26.795]  So there you go, my memory's served.
[02:39:26.795 --> 02:39:30.477]  But let me just get back to this.
[02:39:30.477 --> 02:39:32.278]  Just showing folks, I don't just make this stuff up.
[02:39:32.278 --> 02:39:33.338]  I mean, I'm doing this right here.
[02:39:33.338 --> 02:39:35.679]  This isn't some rigged pre-deal where I say, check this.
[02:39:35.679 --> 02:39:38.101]  I just go off the fly from my memory and see if my memory still works.
[02:39:38.101 --> 02:39:39.521]  It's like a memory game.
[02:39:39.521 --> 02:39:40.622]  The point is, is that
[02:39:42.788 --> 02:39:48.191]  Almost no one alive in this country has almost anybody that owns slaves.
[02:39:48.191 --> 02:39:57.936]  And seven generations back, what plan are you on where you say that my neighbor, a guy down the street, shoots a cop in Nazi Germany?
[02:39:57.936 --> 02:39:59.757]  I get sent to a concentration camp.
[02:40:02.584 --> 02:40:14.046]  That's in America and under jurisprudence and under English common law, you're guilty for what you do, not what somebody else does.
[02:40:14.046 --> 02:40:30.130]  That's like saying if a black man's grandfather robbed a bank and shot the teller in 1952, that that grandson of that guy has to pay reparations to the woman's grandkids that got shot.
[02:40:30.130 --> 02:40:31.350]  That's just crazy!
[02:40:33.032 --> 02:40:43.134]  Beto O'Rourke, he's on TV in between saying the world's gonna end in 12 years like AOC, saying we need to pay reparations to black people.
[02:40:43.134 --> 02:40:47.515]  That's how desperate the Democratic Party is.
[02:40:47.515 --> 02:40:48.216]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:40:48.216 --> 02:40:49.976]  So let's go ahead and roll this clip.
[02:40:49.976 --> 02:40:53.617]  Here it is.
[02:40:55.003 --> 02:41:05.709]  Your fellow Texan, Sheila Jackson Lee, has proposed a commission to study reparations.
[02:41:05.709 --> 02:41:11.333]  If that passes, and you are President of the United States, would you sign that bill?
[02:41:13.772 --> 02:41:28.982]  Yes, I had a chance to speak with and just listen to and learn from Bryan Stevenson in Montgomery, Alabama, and learn from his work on working with the community to build a memorial to justice and peace.
[02:41:28.982 --> 02:41:38.689]  Can you imagine the legal ease of saying the genetic testing, trying to find who had a background and then who pays what?
[02:41:38.689 --> 02:41:41.150]  I mean, that is crazy.
[02:41:41.150 --> 02:41:43.372]  And again, if your daddy
[02:41:44.893 --> 02:41:54.944]  Killed somebody, you're to blame now, because once you start saying sins of the forefathers, and you've got to pay for them, this is the most destructive crap I've ever heard of.
[02:41:54.944 --> 02:41:55.465]  Let's go back to it.
[02:41:56.459 --> 02:41:59.462]  He said foundational to reparations is the word repair.
[02:41:59.462 --> 02:42:02.025]  Foundational to repair is the truth.
[02:42:02.025 --> 02:42:16.702]  And until all Americans understand that civil rights are not just those victories... You hear all that weird little, weird jive talk, weird code, weird NLP about situational repair, truth, jibber jabber.
[02:42:17.503 --> 02:42:19.245]  Because it's just a giant con game.
[02:42:19.245 --> 02:42:29.339]  He's telling you, your newborn baby owes somebody money when you're not, when you weren't even on this damn continent when your great great granddaddy came here.
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:40.102]  It's the craziest thing I've ever heard of, but welcome to America, man.
[02:42:40.102 --> 02:42:41.403]  Welcome to the left.
[02:42:41.403 --> 02:42:44.524]  Chris, Jeff, Grant, Max, Bob, Liberty Smith, and others.
[02:42:44.524 --> 02:42:50.227]  Your calls are just a few minutes away, but whatever you do, spread those links to NewsWars.com.
[02:42:50.227 --> 02:42:51.988]  NewsWars.com.
[02:42:51.988 --> 02:42:53.289]  NewsWars.com.
[02:42:55.205 --> 02:42:57.187]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:42:57.187 --> 02:42:57.907]  Go ahead.
[02:42:57.907 --> 02:43:00.109]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:00.109 --> 02:43:03.972]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:03.972 --> 02:43:05.413]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:05.413 --> 02:43:07.815]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:07.815 --> 02:43:10.137]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:10.137 --> 02:43:14.160]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:16.602]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:17.462 --> 02:43:20.143]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:20.143 --> 02:43:21.484]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:21.484 --> 02:43:22.604]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:22.604 --> 02:43:24.085]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:24.085 --> 02:43:25.165]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:25.165 --> 02:43:26.266]  Put him on pause again.
[02:43:26.266 --> 02:43:27.366]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:27.366 --> 02:43:33.028]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:33.028 --> 02:43:37.550]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:37.550 --> 02:43:40.691]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:40.691 --> 02:43:41.152]  You understand?
[02:43:41.152 --> 02:43:42.792]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:42.792 --> 02:43:43.913]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:44.913 --> 02:43:50.519]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:43:50.519 --> 02:43:51.340]  Do you understand?
[02:43:51.340 --> 02:43:52.882]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:52.882 --> 02:43:55.124]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[02:43:55.124 --> 02:43:58.388]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[02:43:58.388 --> 02:44:01.391]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[02:44:01.391 --> 02:44:06.316]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best.

[02:44:08.258 --> 02:44:09.558]  X2 is back.
[02:44:09.558 --> 02:44:10.178]  We got it.
[02:44:10.178 --> 02:44:11.839]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[02:44:11.839 --> 02:44:13.460]  We rushed it into production.
[02:44:13.460 --> 02:44:14.220]  It's been bottled.
[02:44:14.220 --> 02:44:16.221]  The labels are being put on today.

[02:45:57.030 --> 02:45:58.471]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[02:45:58.471 --> 02:46:00.392]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[02:46:00.392 --> 02:46:00.972]  It is!
[02:46:00.972 --> 02:46:02.553]  But if you took it with fish oil...
[02:46:03.824 --> 02:46:05.847]  It's like the fish oil is it.
[02:46:05.847 --> 02:46:07.188]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:46:07.188 --> 02:46:09.010]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:46:09.010 --> 02:46:11.493]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[02:46:11.493 --> 02:46:13.135]  Brain, body, heart.
[02:46:13.135 --> 02:46:14.596]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[02:46:14.596 --> 02:46:15.958]  You've got the children's.
[02:46:15.958 --> 02:46:16.919]  You've got the adults.
[02:46:16.919 --> 02:46:18.080]  You've got the krill oil.
[02:46:18.080 --> 02:46:21.484]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[02:46:21.484 --> 02:46:23.626]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[02:46:24.086 --> 02:46:24.647]  We're good to go.
[02:46:47.783 --> 02:46:53.328]  We don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:46:53.328 --> 02:46:59.273]  I just can't do it!
[02:46:59.273 --> 02:47:01.895]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:33.046 --> 02:47:37.170]  Alright, I'm going to host part of the next hour with Tom Papert, who runs one of the TV stations we're on.
[02:47:37.170 --> 02:47:38.491]  He's a great talk show host.
[02:47:38.491 --> 02:47:42.194]  He's taken over at 15 After, but I'm going to go to at least 15 of these calls.
[02:47:42.194 --> 02:47:49.621]  Brent and Thomas and Doug and Kevin and Matt and Raymond and Liberty Smith, Bob, Max, Grant, Jeff, Chris and others.
[02:47:49.621 --> 02:47:55.766]  A lot of other breaking news on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:47:55.766 --> 02:47:59.749]  But, I'm not going to go to that yet until I've taken your phone calls.
[02:48:00.763 --> 02:48:04.025]  So let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[02:48:04.025 --> 02:48:11.510]  Let's talk to Doug in Connecticut, a retired police officer, on the so-called drag queen topic.
[02:48:11.510 --> 02:48:22.637]  Convicted pedophiles, child rapists, in disguises like demon clowns, being given access to your children all over the Western world, following a coordinated script.
[02:48:22.637 --> 02:48:25.619]  What do you think's really going on here, Doug?
[02:48:25.619 --> 02:48:29.902]  Well, Alex, to me it's an obvious, one of the most sickest attempts
[02:48:30.444 --> 02:48:30.664]  Okay.
[02:49:00.675 --> 02:49:01.416]  Illegal.
[02:49:01.416 --> 02:49:05.740]  You know, all states have different wording to their laws, but it's impairing the morals of a minor.
[02:49:05.740 --> 02:49:07.842]  It's a risk of injury.
[02:49:07.842 --> 02:49:13.088]  And everybody involved in getting that drag queen to that school needs to be held accountable.
[02:49:13.088 --> 02:49:15.150]  The teacher, the principal, the drag queen itself.
[02:49:16.022 --> 02:49:21.784]  And all the way up to the top, drag queen, or king, whatever they are, you know?
[02:49:21.784 --> 02:49:26.926]  You know, former officer, great points you're making, depending on the state laws.
[02:49:26.926 --> 02:49:32.969]  I noticed two guys in one group in Houston raped six-year-old boys separately in different cases.
[02:49:32.969 --> 02:49:37.370]  We have their records, they're on Infowars.com, thanks to investigators.
[02:49:37.370 --> 02:49:38.731]  Normally that'd be a big deal.
[02:49:38.731 --> 02:49:40.852]  Where are the arrests for them violating parole?
[02:49:40.852 --> 02:49:42.692]  They're both still on parole.
[02:49:42.692 --> 02:49:44.493]  Why is, what's wrong with Houston?
[02:49:45.939 --> 02:49:50.541]  Well, you got somebody up towards the top and in the middle that's corrupting your courts.
[02:49:50.541 --> 02:50:01.586]  You know, I work directly with the courts as a cop and, you know, you get your state's attorneys in there and your prosecutors and a lot of judges, once they gain their robe, they lose their balls, as I've heard from many prosecutors.
[02:50:01.586 --> 02:50:07.069]  And I had a case where I was almost murdered in the line of duty and the guy dropped almost everything.
[02:50:07.069 --> 02:50:09.090]  So I've seen it first hand.
[02:50:09.090 --> 02:50:10.350]  And I worked in a crime analysis.
[02:50:10.350 --> 02:50:13.212]  And let's be honest, why is the left so allied with criminals?
[02:50:14.531 --> 02:50:15.892]  Because they are criminals.
[02:50:15.892 --> 02:50:26.260]  And I think the reason they're so petrified of Trump is he's attempting and will shut down a worldwide, thousands-year-long, probably, criminal enterprise.
[02:50:26.260 --> 02:50:26.961]  Oh, I totally agree.
[02:50:26.961 --> 02:50:32.845]  I've got all this mainstream news about the Islamicists with the UN bringing in hundreds of thousands of sex slaves.
[02:50:32.845 --> 02:50:35.047]  I mean, it's just exploding, the criminal activity.
[02:50:36.219 --> 02:50:41.881]  And it's been their way of life since before you and I were on the planet, and now it's coming to an end.
[02:50:41.881 --> 02:50:47.143]  And they're kicking and screaming and wiping feces on the walls, trying to... They're not going to know what else to do.
[02:50:47.143 --> 02:50:49.264]  They're not going to be employable after this.
[02:50:49.264 --> 02:50:53.125]  And you look at these, they're supposed to be some ugly, demonic little twerp.
[02:50:53.125 --> 02:50:54.286]  And then you look at Blumenthal.
[02:50:54.286 --> 02:50:54.946]  I'm from Connecticut.
[02:50:54.946 --> 02:50:56.487]  I despise Blumenthal.
[02:50:56.487 --> 02:50:57.687]  I despise Murphy.
[02:50:57.687 --> 02:50:59.828]  I send him emails all the time.
[02:50:59.828 --> 02:51:02.289]  And, uh... I'm losing my train of thought, but...
[02:51:02.802 --> 02:51:07.804]  They are the most disgusting, repulsive people on this planet, and their days are numbered.
[02:51:07.804 --> 02:51:15.868]  And I know you don't follow Q and anything, I don't follow it that much, but I remember... No, but I know for a fact, I've been told people nationwide that Blumenthal and Murphy are like as bad as you can get.
[02:51:15.868 --> 02:51:16.648]  That's all I've been told.
[02:51:16.648 --> 02:51:19.410]  I mean, the eyes are the window to the soul, right?
[02:51:19.410 --> 02:51:20.330]  To the window to the soul.
[02:51:20.330 --> 02:51:21.591]  So look at Murphy's eye.
[02:51:21.591 --> 02:51:25.932]  That dude, remember when he went against Obama for trying to impose martial law around the world?
[02:51:25.932 --> 02:51:26.593]  Do you remember that?
[02:51:27.722 --> 02:51:29.603]  So, what happened to that Chris Murphy?
[02:51:29.603 --> 02:51:32.965]  Like, the next couple months he was a completely different character.
[02:51:32.965 --> 02:51:34.766]  And he has fear in those eyes, man.
[02:51:34.766 --> 02:51:36.167]  He has fear.
[02:51:36.167 --> 02:51:37.288]  He's hiding something.
[02:51:37.288 --> 02:51:38.328]  He's compromised.
[02:51:38.328 --> 02:51:41.410]  And then Blumenthal just looks like a big ass demon.
[02:51:41.410 --> 02:51:47.073]  He looks like some HIV positive heroin addict or something.
[02:51:47.073 --> 02:51:48.354]  He does look like a sick demon.
[02:51:48.354 --> 02:51:49.675]  I mean, they all have the same look.
[02:51:49.675 --> 02:51:50.715]  You've mentioned it.
[02:51:50.715 --> 02:51:51.856]  They all have that sick,
[02:51:52.489 --> 02:51:57.054]  Well, I'm not bragging about this, but when Murphy or Blumenthal talk about me, they visibly look like they're scared.
[02:51:57.054 --> 02:51:57.735]  I like that.
[02:51:57.735 --> 02:51:58.056]  I like that.
[02:52:10.854 --> 02:52:16.556]  There'll be a time when it is not safe for these people to walk the streets anymore, and I gotta tell you, what they're doing with kids, we know it.
[02:52:16.556 --> 02:52:23.419]  Let me say this about Q. I got manipulated by somebody close to me that I learned was bad, that Q was bad.
[02:52:23.419 --> 02:52:35.724]  There's some fake Qs out there, but the main Q is right, and I need your whole apology about it, because what they said about Mueller starting to come true, and I have to actually eat crow, I just haven't figured out how to do it yet, that a large part of it is accurate.
[02:52:36.829 --> 02:52:43.012]  Right, well, it takes common sense and some work sometimes to decipher through the BS to get to the core.
[02:52:43.012 --> 02:52:46.254]  You know, if people have the time and common sense, they can find it.
[02:52:46.254 --> 02:52:51.977]  But it's not safe for these people now, and one thing you say that I like is, you don't need orders from headquarters.
[02:52:51.977 --> 02:53:04.564]  Well, a civilian, a parent or a legal guardian doesn't need the police, in my eyes, not being a cop, to go to the school and grab that drag queen and drag them out in the parking lot and dispose of them.
[02:53:05.470 --> 02:53:13.772]  If you're in that school and you're in kids and somebody's not stopping it, I should have the legal right to go in there and put you down without repercussions.
[02:53:13.772 --> 02:53:18.073]  Well, the bottom line is we're going to run their plates and we're going to follow the law and we're going to get them.
[02:53:18.073 --> 02:53:19.894]  God bless you, Doug.
[02:53:19.894 --> 02:53:22.475]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:53:22.475 --> 02:53:23.155]  It's unbelievable.
[02:53:25.349 --> 02:53:27.290]  Vampires aren't real, folks.
[02:53:27.290 --> 02:53:32.773]  But the legends are off of this thing that happens where these people want to hurt kids.
[02:53:32.773 --> 02:53:39.617]  And you look at these so-called drag queens that are convicted pedophiles, their real outfit is like a demonic demon.
[02:53:39.617 --> 02:53:43.379]  And if we don't protect our kids from them, who are we?
[02:53:43.379 --> 02:53:48.202]  They've got major governors passing and trying to pass laws to kill babies after they're born.
[02:53:55.185 --> 02:53:59.128]  Who should we go to next here?
[02:53:59.128 --> 02:54:01.510]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in California.
[02:54:01.510 --> 02:54:02.351]  Go ahead.
[02:54:02.351 --> 02:54:06.775]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:06.775 --> 02:54:08.736]  Welcome.
[02:54:08.736 --> 02:54:13.840]  Hey, I want to start off by saying that I use all of your products.
[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:15.101]  Thank you.
[02:54:15.101 --> 02:54:19.445]  I have your Turbo Force, your Body, your Z-Field.
[02:54:20.325 --> 02:54:26.067]  Super Male, Survival X2, Super 12, Survival Shield X3.
[02:54:26.067 --> 02:54:26.987]  I have them all.
[02:54:26.987 --> 02:54:28.688]  Thank you.
[02:54:28.688 --> 02:54:32.309]  I have, you know, also I have bone cancer.
[02:54:32.309 --> 02:54:32.909]  Wow.
[02:54:32.909 --> 02:54:44.553]  I was diagnosed three and a half years ago, and I bombard my doctor with all the rhetoric that the system wants to throw at us, you know.
[02:54:44.553 --> 02:54:48.114]  Diet, injections, and injunctions will combine from a very early age.
[02:54:49.164 --> 02:54:51.045]  Yeah, you're paraphrasing Bertrand Russell.
[02:54:51.045 --> 02:54:51.145]  I am.
[02:54:51.145 --> 02:54:51.505]  Absolutely.
[02:54:51.505 --> 02:54:53.947]  And I hit them with that all the time, but I hit them
[02:55:19.232 --> 02:55:25.513]  With the eugenics boards, I hit them with all the trash and garbage that they throw at us every day.
[02:55:25.513 --> 02:55:33.975]  You can turn on the TV and every other commercial is an adversement from some big pharma trying to push a new drug on society.
[02:55:33.975 --> 02:55:45.277]  And then immediately following that adversement is another adversement from a law firm that's suing the very drug company for a drug that they pushed on everybody 10 years prior.
[02:55:45.277 --> 02:55:45.997]  It's ridiculous.
[02:55:47.313 --> 02:55:50.795]  I can't imagine why people don't see through all this garbage.
[02:55:50.795 --> 02:55:52.976]  And they tell you the side effects.
[02:55:52.976 --> 02:55:55.437]  See, vaccine makers in 84 are made immune.
[02:55:55.437 --> 02:55:57.238]  They don't show side effects.
[02:55:57.238 --> 02:56:06.623]  All the other drug makers admit the bad stuff it can do to you, but vaccine makers, it's all hidden, but it's still admitted on the vaccine insert, and we try to cover it, and they go, oh, ban that.
[02:56:06.623 --> 02:56:07.883]  That's medical disinfo.
[02:56:07.883 --> 02:56:13.886]  So now, as consumers, we can't tell you a vaccine almost killed us, just like the insert says it might.
[02:56:13.886 --> 02:56:14.367]  God bless you.
[02:56:14.367 --> 02:56:15.087]  Good to hear from you, Kevin.
[02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:19.383]  Let's go to Jeff in Canada.
[02:56:19.383 --> 02:56:19.924]  You're on the air.
[02:56:19.924 --> 02:56:22.387]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:56:22.387 --> 02:56:23.247]  Hey, Alex.
[02:56:23.247 --> 02:56:24.889]  Welcome.
[02:56:24.889 --> 02:56:35.881]  You know, I'm really, you know, thankful that you carry the information that you do because you just don't get it anywhere else in the point in breakdown that you do and I think
[02:56:36.758 --> 02:56:42.300]  You know, there's no way to overestimate what's going on with what's happening with children.
[02:56:42.300 --> 02:56:45.881]  That's the exact... the entire cult is about sucking their energy.
[02:56:45.881 --> 02:56:48.302]  Whatever this thing is, it wants kids.
[02:56:48.302 --> 02:56:49.542]  And what does the Bible tell us?
[02:56:49.542 --> 02:56:52.463]  The devil wants to hurt kids.
[02:56:52.463 --> 02:56:53.123]  Exactly.
[02:56:53.123 --> 02:57:04.867]  And, you know, if this has been done at the level of governors and high-level people and it's being, you know, run through the system, my question is, who is really green-lighting this?
[02:57:05.737 --> 02:57:08.858]  And I've been studying something called the Noahide Law.
[02:57:08.858 --> 02:57:28.547]  I don't know, I've never heard you talk about it, but I'll tell you, that thing is evil, and what it is is globalist Jews, Islamists, and Catholics merging together the Abrahamic faith and coming up with basically a BS law to outlaw Christianity, and they're all green light pedophilia!
[02:57:28.547 --> 02:57:32.408]  I mean, in the Talmud, it says you can sleep with a three-year-old girl.
[02:57:34.867 --> 02:57:39.893]  You know, we know what Islam, we know what the Catholic... Well, I've heard about Noahide Laws.
[02:57:39.893 --> 02:57:44.118]  I think it was like Seventh-day Adventists put out, but I... I want to hear about this when we come back.
[02:57:44.118 --> 02:57:45.279]  Stay there.
[02:57:45.279 --> 02:57:47.542]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[02:57:47.542 --> 02:57:49.284]  There is no set stasis.
[02:57:49.284 --> 02:57:50.506]  There is no managed system.
[02:57:50.506 --> 02:57:52.168]  There is no un-continuum.
[02:57:52.168 --> 02:57:54.851]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[02:57:55.371 --> 02:57:58.733]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:57:58.733 --> 02:57:59.974]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[02:57:59.974 --> 02:58:00.734]  We'll be here forever.
[02:58:00.734 --> 02:58:02.015]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:58:02.015 --> 02:58:08.899]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[02:58:08.899 --> 02:58:09.459]  We made it.
[02:58:09.459 --> 02:58:11.641]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:58:11.641 --> 02:58:13.842]  God's got a big war for you ready and show.
[02:58:14.022 --> 02:58:20.488]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[02:58:20.488 --> 02:58:25.552]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[02:58:25.552 --> 02:58:28.415]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:58:28.415 --> 02:58:30.797]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[02:58:30.797 --> 02:58:34.300]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[02:58:34.300 --> 02:58:35.341]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:58:35.581 --> 02:58:39.867]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[02:58:39.867 --> 02:58:42.571]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[02:58:42.571 --> 02:58:43.812]  I want life!
[02:58:43.812 --> 02:58:44.654]  I want Jesus!
[02:58:46.249 --> 02:58:48.950]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:58:48.950 --> 02:58:55.311]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:58:55.311 --> 02:58:57.271]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[02:58:57.271 --> 02:59:03.913]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[02:59:03.913 --> 02:59:09.694]  Made with ancient ingredients used for thousands of years, Happies can help you take back the day.
[02:59:10.094 --> 02:59:10.834]  We're good to go.
[02:59:29.722 --> 02:59:32.243]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:17.188 --> 03:00:18.289]  Alright, Jeff in Canada.
[03:00:18.289 --> 03:00:20.130]  We're going to go to Zach from Morocco.
[03:00:20.130 --> 03:00:21.111]  Frequent caller.
[03:00:21.111 --> 03:00:23.072]  Hadn't called in about three or four months.
[03:00:23.072 --> 03:00:24.293]  Always informative.
[03:00:24.293 --> 03:00:25.094]  Jeff in Canada.
[03:00:25.094 --> 03:00:25.594]  You're on the air.
[03:00:25.594 --> 03:00:27.716]  Go ahead.
[03:00:27.716 --> 03:00:30.077]  So I brought up the Noahide Law.
[03:00:30.077 --> 03:00:34.321]  That's N-O-A-H-I-D-E Law.
[03:00:34.321 --> 03:00:41.366]  And that was signed into law by George Herbert Walker Bush in 1991.
[03:00:41.366 --> 03:00:45.969]  Not a lot of people know about this, but apparently since then all 50 states have signed on to it.
[03:00:46.915 --> 03:01:03.520]  And my concern with it is, first off, there's a blasphemy law in there, which, if you run the table on what it all means, is it's outlawing belief in Jesus, and it's punishable by beheading, of all things.
[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:08.441]  Well, I know there's a big UN move to unify all the religions, and it's all anti-Christian.
[03:01:08.441 --> 03:01:10.582]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[03:01:10.582 --> 03:01:11.282]  Let's go ahead.
[03:01:11.282 --> 03:01:14.143]  I was about to go to Zach, but it looked like he just hung up.
[03:01:15.652 --> 03:01:18.514]  So let's go ahead and talk to Grant in Iowa.
[03:01:18.514 --> 03:01:19.194]  Grant, you're on the air.
[03:01:19.194 --> 03:01:22.096]  Go ahead.
[03:01:22.096 --> 03:01:22.557]  Hey, Alex.
[03:01:22.557 --> 03:01:25.078]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:01:25.078 --> 03:01:27.980]  Going back to the drag queen deal.
[03:01:27.980 --> 03:01:29.461]  You know, we've talked about this before.
[03:01:29.461 --> 03:01:30.322]  You've talked about this before.
[03:01:30.322 --> 03:01:32.343]  I've talked to Owen about it.
[03:01:32.343 --> 03:01:34.405]  These people embrace the dark.
[03:01:34.405 --> 03:01:35.886]  They ignore the truth.
[03:01:35.886 --> 03:01:38.067]  They don't have the drive to seek it out like we do.
[03:01:38.067 --> 03:01:39.428]  And like you said, they're just vessels.
[03:01:40.646 --> 03:01:54.639]  They're being passive, which leads them to being led by the devil toward the darkness, which is obviously clearly and obviously encouraged by technology and the media and Hollywood, and all the automated, instant gratifying, zero patient system that they've built.
[03:01:54.639 --> 03:02:05.129]  Imagine being these mothers mainly, taking your children, in some cases they don't ask, it's at the elementary school, and giving them to convicted pedophiles to sit on their lap, and the women look totally whacked out of their minds.
[03:02:07.392 --> 03:02:13.014]  I mean, it's hard to even imagine, you know, because I'm not a crazy person.
[03:02:13.014 --> 03:02:16.875]  But, you know, a lot of people are just aren't engaged in politics and don't know what's going on.
[03:02:16.875 --> 03:02:22.017]  I feel like having your head in the sand is some ways just as bad as actively participating in the deception.
[03:02:22.017 --> 03:02:23.557]  Oh, I agree.
[03:02:23.557 --> 03:02:31.740]  You know, we have to put effort into finding the light and finding the truth versus they just get to slack off and sit around vacuously staring into their Imperial probe droids.
[03:02:33.129 --> 03:02:38.032]  And the other awfully terrible point you made earlier, you know, think of the crimes that these people aren't caught for.
[03:02:38.032 --> 03:02:45.196]  It's just like at the border when you encounter and apprehend 100,000 illegal border crossers in the month of March.
[03:02:45.196 --> 03:02:48.998]  There's two or 300,000 more that you didn't encounter nor apprehend.
[03:02:48.998 --> 03:02:52.800]  Or way more than that, some sectors have reported 13 to 15,000 a day.
[03:02:56.403 --> 03:02:58.805]  It's overwhelming, you know, something has to be done.
[03:02:58.805 --> 03:03:04.129]  And they're smuggling kids and they admit they are, but nobody cares about those kids.
[03:03:04.129 --> 03:03:11.174]  No, and we have to stop being afraid of economic woes and the cost of children when we're already paying for so many other people's kids.
[03:03:11.174 --> 03:03:12.555]  The middle class is under attack.
[03:03:12.555 --> 03:03:14.376]  We have to get back to replacement rate.
[03:03:14.376 --> 03:03:16.378]  You've been warning about this for years.
[03:03:16.378 --> 03:03:22.583]  We have to fight back and raise real children with real brains instead of letting the Apple computer chip raise them.
[03:03:22.583 --> 03:03:25.705]  And it was a really dark segment when you went over that stuff last hour.
[03:03:26.294 --> 03:03:35.881]  You know, I go to the mall, I go to campus, I go almost anywhere in public and I can feel that darkness around me, the emptiness, the place where the humanity should be.
[03:03:35.881 --> 03:03:44.147]  It's different if you're at like a basketball game or a rock concert because at least people are engaged in something tangible and they're doing something together which makes us feel alive.
[03:03:44.147 --> 03:03:47.830]  But we shouldn't have to go to sporting events just to get that connection with others.
[03:03:47.830 --> 03:03:49.391]  Just like Doug from Connecticut from said,
[03:03:50.666 --> 03:04:00.710]  The eyes are absolutely the window to the soul, and you can look at these people, look at Schiff when he's lying to you on national television over and over, and you can see that they know that they're trying to deceive.
[03:04:00.710 --> 03:04:01.750]  They're not.
[03:04:01.750 --> 03:04:02.590]  They're not.
[03:04:02.590 --> 03:04:03.191]  Well, that's right.
[03:04:03.191 --> 03:04:09.893]  Politically and economically and culturally, you know he's a liar, but also just looking at him, you're like, that's the bad guy.
[03:04:09.893 --> 03:04:11.634]  That is a sack of garbage.
[03:04:11.634 --> 03:04:17.516]  That is a lying deceiver on a power trip trying to hype himself up to look credible.
[03:04:18.854 --> 03:04:22.498]  You gotta trust your gut on these things, like you've said before.
[03:04:22.498 --> 03:04:29.567]  My last little idea, you didn't take a lot of calls this week, but you guys should do a Joe Biden hair shampoo commercial.
[03:04:29.567 --> 03:04:31.890]  It'd be pretty hilarious, I think.
[03:04:31.890 --> 03:04:32.470]  How do we do it?
[03:04:35.296 --> 03:04:42.325]  Shampoo commercial where you're like, oh look, our shampoo smells so fresh and then have Joe, you know, cut to him smelling all the hair and be like, Joe loves it.
[03:04:42.325 --> 03:04:43.346]  No, I totally agree.
[03:04:43.346 --> 03:04:43.726]  That's it.
[03:04:43.726 --> 03:04:48.612]  I need to do the voiceover, like... And now Vidal Sassoon rolls out its new product.
[03:04:48.612 --> 03:04:51.156]  Sponsored by our new star, Joe Biden.
[03:04:54.338 --> 03:04:59.420]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[03:04:59.420 --> 03:05:02.342]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.
[03:05:02.342 --> 03:05:04.983]  So this is the best deal we've ever offered.

[03:05:57.329 --> 03:06:06.235]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:10.902 --> 03:06:11.402]  Imagine!
[03:06:11.402 --> 03:06:16.985]  You got a neighbor you've known for 10 years, came over to play chess every month, had barbecues.
[03:06:16.985 --> 03:06:20.568]  She came over one time, you've got some small children.
[03:06:33.106 --> 03:06:50.595]  And you got a pool party going on at your house, and you walk out in the back, grilling hamburgers, and there's Bob, or David, or William, or whatever his name is, and he's got your seven-year-old daughter sitting on his lap, and he's rubbing her butt, and he says, you want to touch my beard?
[03:06:50.595 --> 03:06:51.315]  You like that?
[03:06:51.315 --> 03:06:52.095]  You could be a boy.
[03:06:52.095 --> 03:06:53.696]  You could be a girl.
[03:06:53.696 --> 03:06:55.837]  You could shake your booty.
[03:06:55.837 --> 03:06:59.679]  You'd say, Bob, get your ass out of here.
[03:06:59.679 --> 03:07:01.540]  And you'd probably move, not to live next door to Bob.
[03:07:03.365 --> 03:07:20.566]  That goes on in public, and they don't even ask in many cities, where they have your elementary school students sit on their freakish laps, and they tell you, we're getting your kids, and you put up with that.
[03:07:20.566 --> 03:07:20.927]  It's sick.
[03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:35.941]  But here's the thing, raping kids is still illegal.
[03:07:35.941 --> 03:07:40.523]  And so all over the country, people are going to these events that are right on their backgrounds.
[03:07:40.523 --> 03:07:44.064]  And these men who think they're disguised are being exposed.
[03:07:44.064 --> 03:07:45.464]  So I salute everybody that's doing that.
[03:07:45.464 --> 03:07:48.985]  I want you to keep it up.
[03:07:48.985 --> 03:07:54.547]  All right, who's been holding the longest here?
[03:07:54.547 --> 03:07:57.868]  Let's go ahead and talk to Liberty Smith in Oklahoma.
[03:07:57.868 --> 03:07:58.748]  You're on the air, welcome.
[03:08:00.762 --> 03:08:01.422]  You there?
[03:08:01.422 --> 03:08:02.743]  Yes, sir.
[03:08:02.743 --> 03:08:05.525]  Use Prel for the smell.
[03:08:05.525 --> 03:08:07.886]  How about that?
[03:08:07.886 --> 03:08:09.447]  A little distorted audio, but go ahead.
[03:08:09.447 --> 03:08:16.512]  Oh, I just, for the meme on the Biden thing, use Prel for the smell.
[03:08:16.512 --> 03:08:18.213]  Prel for the smell.
[03:08:18.213 --> 03:08:21.795]  Smells like tyranny, yeah.
[03:08:21.795 --> 03:08:24.917]  Anyway, I agree with all those callers that have called
[03:08:25.580 --> 03:08:29.781]  Just recently, Alex, so I'm not going to bother you with all that.
[03:08:29.781 --> 03:08:40.345]  All I'm going to say is I have some personal reasons, which I have no problem telling you off air, but these pedophiles need to go down, Alex.
[03:08:40.345 --> 03:08:43.986]  I mean, enough's enough, and I want to be part of that.
[03:08:43.986 --> 03:08:45.567]  I'm a 62-year-old man.
[03:08:45.567 --> 03:08:46.787]  I have a son your age.
[03:08:46.787 --> 03:08:48.788]  I've got 12 grandchildren.
[03:08:48.788 --> 03:08:49.928]  Enough's enough, man.
[03:08:51.030 --> 03:08:55.931]  I mean, it's an emotional thing for me, just as many other things are.
[03:08:55.931 --> 03:09:00.512]  But this particular one should piss any man off.
[03:09:00.512 --> 03:09:01.932]  I mean, enough is enough.
[03:09:01.932 --> 03:09:06.053]  What, big old fat pedophiles want to bounce your daughter, granddaughter on their knee?
[03:09:06.053 --> 03:09:06.853]  Yeah.
[03:09:06.853 --> 03:09:09.434]  Or all these perverts want to go meet with your kids?
[03:09:09.434 --> 03:09:12.214]  They're like, we're going to meet with your kids, and the left's going to let us!
[03:09:12.214 --> 03:09:15.055]  Because we, we, we, your kids are ours!
[03:09:16.556 --> 03:09:18.597]  I know, and it's crazy.
[03:09:18.597 --> 03:09:21.939]  I just can't see why anybody would even put up with it.
[03:09:21.939 --> 03:09:30.783]  And like I said, I've got personal reasons, but I want to be part of it in any way, shape, or form, taking these demonic pedophiles down.
[03:09:30.783 --> 03:09:36.206]  I mean, it's a button point for me, as far as I'm concerned, and any man should be.
[03:09:36.206 --> 03:09:37.467]  God, it's so creepy, man.
[03:09:37.467 --> 03:09:42.970]  Convicted child rapist dressed up as women at government-sponsored events, and the mayor says, we're going to keep doing it.
[03:09:43.612 --> 03:09:45.033]  I think that mayor's probably been compromised.
[03:09:45.033 --> 03:09:46.073]  Liberty Smith, thanks so much.
[03:09:46.073 --> 03:09:49.035]  Let's talk to Matt in California.
[03:09:49.035 --> 03:09:50.796]  The Drag Queen Trans Story Time.
[03:09:50.796 --> 03:09:52.697]  Go ahead.
[03:09:52.697 --> 03:09:54.098]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:09:54.098 --> 03:09:55.139]  Thank you, I really appreciate it.
[03:09:55.139 --> 03:09:55.359]  Thank you.
[03:09:55.359 --> 03:09:58.101]  Just real quick, I've purchased a lot of your products.
[03:09:58.101 --> 03:10:02.083]  I won't go through the entire list, but just about everything that everyone else has said too, I've got them.
[03:10:02.083 --> 03:10:05.705]  And still holding on tight to my Hillary for Prison shirt.
[03:10:05.705 --> 03:10:10.108]  But yeah, in Long Beach, California, I was surprised when I heard too that
[03:10:11.141 --> 03:10:14.042]  You know, that that happened here at the Michelle Obama Library.
[03:10:14.042 --> 03:10:18.984]  It was that one that had the giant white horns with the red tips on it, that crazy psycho.
[03:10:18.984 --> 03:10:24.367]  Yeah, it was the man dressed like a Pokemon demon, yeah.
[03:10:24.367 --> 03:10:25.047]  Exactly.
[03:10:25.047 --> 03:10:26.508]  And it's just like The Last Caller.
[03:10:26.508 --> 03:10:35.472]  That should upset every man, father, grandfather, brother, that these people are out there and they need to be stopped.
[03:10:36.905 --> 03:10:45.533]  It's almost like, you know, if you caught one, it would just be like, I'd be standing there just like Marcellus Wallace, you know, Pulp Fiction with that, you know, just like, this guy, these guys are done.
[03:10:45.533 --> 03:10:46.454]  I mean, and I.
[03:10:47.458 --> 03:10:48.479]  Full-on support you guys.
[03:10:48.479 --> 03:10:50.080]  You know, thank you so much.
[03:10:50.080 --> 03:10:51.001]  No, don't thank me, brother.
[03:10:51.001 --> 03:10:53.423]  We're doing this because it's a common sense survival.
[03:10:53.423 --> 03:10:55.204]  Please don't thank me for coming up for oxygen, Matt.
[03:10:55.204 --> 03:10:56.345]  God bless you.
[03:10:56.345 --> 03:10:59.187]  Yeah, it's, look, this is their plan.
[03:10:59.187 --> 03:11:02.810]  The globalists are obsessed with the flesh and hurting children.
[03:11:02.810 --> 03:11:12.158]  Whether it's killing them after they're born for their organs, or whether it's putting them on drugs, or whether it's raping them, that's the left's religion.
[03:11:12.158 --> 03:11:12.778]  They're the left.
[03:11:12.778 --> 03:11:13.919]  They're the left-hand path.
[03:11:13.919 --> 03:11:15.460]  What does the left do?
[03:11:15.460 --> 03:11:16.321]  Everybody knows what they do.
[03:11:17.386 --> 03:11:18.887]  Let's talk to Max in Wisconsin.
[03:11:18.887 --> 03:11:19.407]  You're on the air.
[03:11:19.407 --> 03:11:21.429]  Welcome.
[03:11:21.429 --> 03:11:25.571]  Hi, Mr. Ahead of a Curve, Mr. Van Helsing.
[03:11:25.571 --> 03:11:35.998]  First of all, with the previous caller, if they really want to help out with getting not only this issue, but other issues, they should flood you with cash.
[03:11:36.673 --> 03:11:40.854]  You know, you're the most, uh, biggest guy in this right now.
[03:11:40.854 --> 03:11:41.834]  Well, we're fighting hard.
[03:11:41.834 --> 03:11:45.895]  They got the dark side suing us, and they're poor victims they're using, but we're fighting hard.
[03:11:45.895 --> 03:11:47.915]  People have been supporting us, so yes, thank you, brother.
[03:11:47.915 --> 03:11:50.396]  But I mean, again, people keep saying to me, this is what you're supposed to do.
[03:11:50.396 --> 03:11:56.577]  I mean, I've got children too, but so what's your take on the ancient history of vampires?
[03:11:56.577 --> 03:12:00.938]  Well, the word, uh, vampire is the word vampire.
[03:12:00.938 --> 03:12:05.579]  Uh, it's from the Balkan region, and it's a very ancient problem.
[03:12:06.568 --> 03:12:11.191]  Um, there's been, they weren't able to solve it back then, and it would always pop up again.
[03:12:11.191 --> 03:12:22.079]  Uh, some believed it was a PSYOP to psych out the manly, uh, Spartan-like and soldiers, uh, in the area.
[03:12:22.079 --> 03:12:35.728]  Um, others believed that there, um, was in the ground heavy metals that contaminated the well water, even radioactive elements that cause, like, Mad Hatter Syndrome.
[03:12:36.448 --> 03:12:47.951]  But it's never been solved, and I think it's an issue which is testing from God the human element.
[03:12:47.951 --> 03:12:48.931]  And we're being tested.
[03:12:48.931 --> 03:12:50.271]  By the way, you're not just saying this.
[03:12:50.271 --> 03:12:51.692]  Actually, I researched this.
[03:12:51.692 --> 03:12:53.212]  It was in old history books.
[03:12:53.212 --> 03:12:54.792]  Greece had a problem with vampires.
[03:12:54.792 --> 03:12:55.393]  Russia did.
[03:12:55.393 --> 03:12:57.513]  The Balkans, as you said, big problems.
[03:12:57.513 --> 03:12:58.573]  Transylvania.
[03:12:58.573 --> 03:13:01.154]  People wouldn't let their kids out at night because people grab them and eat them.
[03:13:03.268 --> 03:13:22.577]  And another big issue was that at the time when there was hunting parties, as you discussed, as you recall in folklore, they could go into hibernation for extended periods of time in coffins.
[03:13:22.577 --> 03:13:25.319]  You know, we've all seen and heard those stories, movies, etc.
[03:13:28.607 --> 03:13:32.289]  I still think people should just flood you with cash, just load you up.
[03:13:32.289 --> 03:13:33.669]  Soros, great money.
[03:13:33.669 --> 03:13:36.090]  You know, you should have as much money as Soros.
[03:13:36.090 --> 03:13:40.412]  Well, believe me, I'm actually drooling, not for the money, but for what I can do with it.
[03:13:40.412 --> 03:13:41.092]  Absolutely.
[03:13:41.092 --> 03:13:44.594]  People will just buy the products and just sign up for AutoShip and just do it.
[03:13:44.594 --> 03:13:49.416]  Because, I mean, we're nip and tuck and I want to be way ahead to expand things.
[03:13:49.416 --> 03:13:53.677]  But regardless, God keeps coming through and I thank you so much, Max.
[03:13:53.677 --> 03:13:55.278]  And again, I don't go down this vampire road.
[03:13:59.239 --> 03:14:00.801]  They're not literal vampires.
[03:14:00.801 --> 03:14:02.963]  They don't live forever.
[03:14:02.963 --> 03:14:08.409]  But they're promised that by their God, and they think they are, and the spirit we're dealing with is very old.
[03:14:08.409 --> 03:14:13.634]  And the thing is, it jumps from person to person, so that's where you get the thing of like, it doesn't die.
[03:14:13.634 --> 03:14:16.798]  You can kill the vampire, the possessed person that just keeps coming back.
[03:14:17.788 --> 03:14:20.130]  And they always put clown makeup on.
[03:14:20.130 --> 03:14:28.695]  If you actually read the older histories in Greece, or in the Balkans, or even Japan, people would put makeup on, they'd go out and they'd just grab women and kids and like suck their blood.
[03:14:28.695 --> 03:14:30.376]  And you're like, well those are psychotics!
[03:14:30.376 --> 03:14:31.437]  Exactly.
[03:14:31.437 --> 03:14:38.422]  So there's a certain thing happens, especially in cities and civilizations, where you get psychotics that lust after children's blood.
[03:14:38.422 --> 03:14:39.282]  Which means the essence.
[03:14:39.282 --> 03:14:41.224]  It means they can rape them, they can kill them.
[03:14:41.224 --> 03:14:45.326]  Whatever it is, they want to terrorize them, like Monsters School or whatever.
[03:14:45.326 --> 03:14:46.167]  I've seen that movie.
[03:14:46.167 --> 03:14:46.567]  What is it?
[03:14:46.567 --> 03:14:47.088]  Monsters and...
[03:14:47.888 --> 03:14:51.389]  Monsters Academy, where the ghosts get power off scaring kids.
[03:14:51.389 --> 03:14:53.930]  And they're kind of telling you what they're doing right there.
[03:14:53.930 --> 03:15:00.753]  Now, I said Mr. Pappert, who does a great job and manages one of our great TV affiliates, is about to take over.
[03:15:00.753 --> 03:15:02.794]  And I really appreciate the great job he does once a week.
[03:15:02.794 --> 03:15:03.914]  I want to get him his own show soon.
[03:15:03.914 --> 03:15:05.495]  We're trying to line that up, get it done.
[03:15:05.495 --> 03:15:07.916]  But I promised to finish your calls.
[03:15:07.916 --> 03:15:09.877]  When we come back, I'll take four or five more calls.
[03:15:09.877 --> 03:15:11.197]  Bam, bam, bam, fast.
[03:15:11.197 --> 03:15:14.398]  And then Tom Pappert's going to take over all the great work he does.
[03:15:14.398 --> 03:15:15.199]  So look for that.
[03:15:16.488 --> 03:15:17.529]  I didn't even plug last hour.
[03:15:17.529 --> 03:15:19.169]  I'm going to plug this hour.
[03:15:19.169 --> 03:15:21.811]  Storewide free shipping is about to end this weekend.
[03:15:21.811 --> 03:15:22.411]  It's got to end.
[03:15:22.411 --> 03:15:25.633]  I've got to come up with some new specials.
[03:15:25.633 --> 03:15:29.495]  And a lot of the best sellers are about to sell out the 50 to 60% off all the supplements.
[03:15:31.055 --> 03:15:34.457]  Double Patriot points and so much more at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:15:34.457 --> 03:15:41.502]  So yeah, I mean, believe me folks, X2, DNA Force, these are amazing products and they're game changers.

[03:17:22.947 --> 03:17:24.168]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:24.168 --> 03:17:28.091]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:28.091 --> 03:17:29.632]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.632 --> 03:17:32.594]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.594 --> 03:17:38.137]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:38.137 --> 03:17:39.338]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:39.338 --> 03:17:42.280]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:42.280 --> 03:17:44.502]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:44.502 --> 03:17:48.945]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:17:48.945 --> 03:17:51.286]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:54.284 --> 03:17:58.948]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[03:17:58.948 --> 03:18:03.171]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[03:18:03.171 --> 03:18:11.117]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[03:18:11.117 --> 03:18:14.239]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[03:18:14.239 --> 03:18:17.721]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[03:18:19.063 --> 03:18:22.185]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[03:18:22.185 --> 03:18:24.227]  We are the power structure.
[03:18:24.227 --> 03:18:25.848]  We are the inventors.
[03:18:25.848 --> 03:18:27.610]  We are the trailblazers.
[03:18:27.610 --> 03:18:31.013]  And the globalists understand that.
[03:18:31.013 --> 03:18:38.119]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[03:18:38.119 --> 03:18:41.942]  Now, to help fund our operations, I'm down at the very tip of the spear against these globalists.

[03:20:30.059 --> 03:20:32.361]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[03:20:32.361 --> 03:20:36.886]  Tom Pappard's taking over here in just a few minutes, but I promise to knock these calls out.
[03:20:36.886 --> 03:20:39.068]  Bill in Kentucky, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:20:39.068 --> 03:20:39.649]  Thanks for holding.
[03:20:41.420 --> 03:20:42.842]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[03:20:42.842 --> 03:20:50.269]  I'm kind of going to shift gears away from the basic topic, but it all has to do with the same thing.
[03:20:50.269 --> 03:20:51.510]  I've got a question for you.
[03:20:51.510 --> 03:21:02.121]  Why is it that Adam Schiff can constantly beat the pulpit that he's got evidence of problems with Trump?
[03:21:02.972 --> 03:21:10.553]  But yet, why isn't he obstructing justice in saying that without being made to cough it up?
[03:21:10.553 --> 03:21:24.616]  Because they still think they control a lot of the agencies, and he thinks corporate media will protect him, and still a lot of Republican leaders think old corporate media has power, so they've been basically bullied into submitting to him.
[03:21:24.616 --> 03:21:27.276]  It's all bluster.
[03:21:27.276 --> 03:21:30.097]  Well, you know, I still get back to the same old thing.
[03:21:30.097 --> 03:21:32.277]  The basics is that the devil's using his
[03:21:33.129 --> 03:21:36.754]  This is toolbox manipulation, intimidation, and domination.
[03:21:36.754 --> 03:21:39.859]  If we can get that in our heads, I think we can deal with this.
[03:21:39.859 --> 03:21:41.481]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:21:41.481 --> 03:21:45.186]  Notice the Bible says the devil goes about roaring like a lion.
[03:21:46.129 --> 03:21:47.230]  Not a lion.
[03:21:47.230 --> 03:21:51.532]  Roaring like a lion seeing who he can devour.
[03:21:51.532 --> 03:21:59.156]  And I used to always watch like horror movies, didn't really like them, but like Friday the 13th where he's chasing the woman and she falls down and crawls on her back and doesn't fight back.
[03:21:59.156 --> 03:22:02.318]  I thought, well, that's not true because you or I would fight back.
[03:22:02.318 --> 03:22:03.198]  But it's true.
[03:22:03.198 --> 03:22:06.901]  A lot of people fall down and grovel to evil instead of fighting it.
[03:22:06.901 --> 03:22:09.182]  So the devil looks for who he can devour.
[03:22:09.182 --> 03:22:10.643]  Does that make sense?
[03:22:10.643 --> 03:22:11.023]  Absolutely.
[03:22:12.609 --> 03:22:13.591]  Absolutely.
[03:22:13.591 --> 03:22:18.439]  Well, listen, I appreciate you taking my call and God bless and Godspeed.
[03:22:18.439 --> 03:22:20.162]  God bless you, Bill, for putting up with me.
[03:22:20.162 --> 03:22:24.610]  Because I babble a lot, but this is a great time to be alive and listen to all you guys who's humbling.
[03:22:25.931 --> 03:22:33.817]  And again, I'm not saying they're literal vampires, but they're demonic, and the spirit wants to hurt children, because children are as close to God as you can get.
[03:22:33.817 --> 03:22:37.320]  They're made by God, they're in God's image, and they haven't been corrupted yet.
[03:22:37.320 --> 03:22:44.425]  They're as close to the garden before Adam and Eve fell as you can get, and the devil hates them.
[03:22:44.425 --> 03:22:46.407]  And that's it.
[03:22:46.407 --> 03:22:48.168]  The devil hates God.
[03:22:48.168 --> 03:22:54.413]  And a newborn baby is as close as you're going to get to God on this planet in the flesh.
[03:22:54.413 --> 03:22:54.713]  That's it.
[03:22:56.408 --> 03:22:57.228]  Yes, can you hear me?
[03:22:57.228 --> 03:23:00.970]  Uh, so cool to talk to you, Alex, man.
[03:23:00.970 --> 03:23:02.091]  I'm almost giddy about it.
[03:23:02.091 --> 03:23:04.192]  Uh, well listen, I probably should plug your iodine, man.
[03:23:04.192 --> 03:23:09.094]  Because I had a very extraordinary experience with it.
[03:23:26.960 --> 03:23:29.640]  Um, I was eating this Chinese joint, right?
[03:23:29.640 --> 03:23:30.661]  Really good food, man.
[03:23:30.661 --> 03:23:31.901]  Best I ever had.
[03:23:31.901 --> 03:23:33.741]  But they had the seafood.
[03:23:33.741 --> 03:23:37.462]  And you know it's that Pacific seafood, man, that Fukushima seafood.
[03:23:37.462 --> 03:23:40.122]  And I was eating it religiously every week.
[03:23:40.122 --> 03:23:42.683]  And, uh, anyways, I was just feeling terrible.
[03:23:42.683 --> 03:23:44.063]  Like, three days a week.
[03:23:44.063 --> 03:23:46.363]  And, I mean, I'm a lean, healthy guy.
[03:23:46.363 --> 03:23:49.724]  Workout, clean diet, all of that.
[03:23:49.724 --> 03:23:52.765]  But I still felt terrible, so I knew in my gut, man, I needed to try the iodine.
[03:23:52.765 --> 03:23:54.165]  Well, anyway, I did.
[03:23:54.165 --> 03:23:55.205]  And after about two weeks,
[03:23:55.871 --> 03:23:59.554]  I went to sleep one night and slept harder than I ever have.
[03:23:59.554 --> 03:24:02.336]  And I woke up that next day feeling like a kid again.
[03:24:02.336 --> 03:24:05.719]  Like, I've never felt that good since I was a kid.
[03:24:05.719 --> 03:24:08.221]  And I have every day since, as long as I take it.
[03:24:08.221 --> 03:24:11.464]  But I'm like you, I'll get out of the habit of taking and I'll start feeling bad again.
[03:24:11.464 --> 03:24:12.965]  You just said it.
[03:24:12.965 --> 03:24:18.870]  I just told my wife, I said, honey, I'm not good at taking DNA Force and X2 and the fish oil.
[03:24:18.870 --> 03:24:20.051]  I forget.
[03:24:20.051 --> 03:24:21.292]  Will you make me take it?
[03:24:21.292 --> 03:24:23.153]  Because she's a big health nut and in great shape.
[03:24:24.096 --> 03:24:25.337]  And she said, yeah, I'll do it.
[03:24:25.337 --> 03:24:26.538]  So I'm the same way.
[03:24:26.538 --> 03:24:29.861]  I forget, even though I do it for a month and feel great, then I forget.
[03:24:29.861 --> 03:24:31.502]  You just said it.
[03:24:31.502 --> 03:24:33.443]  Our bodies are starving for good iodine.
[03:24:33.443 --> 03:24:35.665]  They're starving for what's in clean fish oil.
[03:24:35.665 --> 03:24:37.687]  They're starving for what's in DNA force.
[03:24:37.687 --> 03:24:43.852]  And like you said, if I take X2 every day for a week or two, and don't forget, the sleep is like when you're a kid.
[03:24:43.852 --> 03:24:48.315]  Remember when you were a kid, it hurt to get up because you slept so good?
[03:24:48.315 --> 03:24:52.939]  And that's what with X2 and things, you will have the sleep that hurts to get up.
[03:24:53.819 --> 03:24:58.184]  I remember like deer hunting when I was like nine years old, seven years old, at 4 a.m.
[03:24:58.184 --> 03:25:00.166]  I got to cook breakfast, get up somewhere, cook breakfast.
[03:25:00.166 --> 03:25:01.787]  How bad it hurt to get up?
[03:25:01.787 --> 03:25:03.629]  But you think back, that's because the sleep was so good.
[03:25:03.629 --> 03:25:09.254]  And I have sleep that hurts to get up when I take particularly the X2.
[03:25:09.254 --> 03:25:10.936]  That's a great way of putting it.
[03:25:10.936 --> 03:25:13.539]  I swear to God, this is the truth.
[03:25:13.539 --> 03:25:16.321]  A week ago I had dreams so hard, slept so good, but I took a bunch of X2.
[03:25:17.813 --> 03:25:20.394]  But I meant to come in here and talk about that deep sleep you get.
[03:25:20.394 --> 03:25:23.355]  And I guess it's just God working through things that you called in and talked about it.
[03:25:23.355 --> 03:25:26.776]  But you know what I'm talking about where you sleep so good you don't want to get up?
[03:25:26.776 --> 03:25:30.317]  Definitely.
[03:25:30.317 --> 03:25:31.677]  Definitely.
[03:25:31.677 --> 03:25:35.278]  Anyways, what I was calling to talk about was, I'm with you, man.
[03:25:35.278 --> 03:25:37.999]  You know, I'm on the Zot guy.
[03:25:37.999 --> 03:25:39.600]  My finger's on the pulse, man.
[03:25:39.600 --> 03:25:41.240]  I predicted Trump.
[03:25:41.240 --> 03:25:44.661]  I was trying to wage bets with people and everybody said Hillary was going to win.
[03:25:44.661 --> 03:25:45.381]  I mean, I was on it.
[03:25:47.869 --> 03:25:55.335]  When you ran that earlier about those pedophiles, man, and I've seen those two creeps, you know, they were talking about bringing your kids to the screen.
[03:25:55.335 --> 03:25:56.416]  I felt it.
[03:25:56.416 --> 03:25:57.417]  I felt it in my gut.
[03:25:57.417 --> 03:26:00.599]  This is what, like, the Bible warned us about.
[03:26:00.599 --> 03:26:02.680]  This is a big power.
[03:26:02.680 --> 03:26:05.382]  This is a big global force.
[03:26:05.382 --> 03:26:06.403]  This is the anti-crime.
[03:26:06.403 --> 03:26:08.385]  I mean, this is the devil.
[03:26:08.385 --> 03:26:09.866]  And I can just feel it.
[03:26:09.866 --> 03:26:14.049]  I mean, I've never been so disgusted in my life about anything.
[03:26:16.960 --> 03:26:23.205]  No, I totally agree, and as bad as it is though, everything God told us is now being fulfilled, so how good is that?
[03:26:23.205 --> 03:26:31.973]  As bad as this is, Mark of the Beast, One World Government, they're coming for our kids, how good does it make it though to know that Revelations is true and that God's real?
[03:26:31.973 --> 03:26:36.037]  And cared about us so much that God would give us a cheat sheet to get out of this.
[03:26:37.403 --> 03:26:38.863]  They will make a believer out of you.
[03:26:38.863 --> 03:26:39.943]  I mean, definitely.
[03:26:39.943 --> 03:26:44.764]  I mean, because whether or not you believe in God, it's pretty apparent that Satan is real.
[03:26:44.764 --> 03:26:50.325]  This stuff couldn't be happening without a dark, evil entity, you know, running the show.
[03:26:50.325 --> 03:26:51.626]  Oh, it's all coordinated.
[03:26:51.626 --> 03:26:53.966]  It's all coordinated.
[03:26:53.966 --> 03:26:54.606]  It's pretty clear.
[03:26:54.606 --> 03:26:55.586]  It's pretty obvious now.
[03:26:55.586 --> 03:27:01.707]  It doesn't take, you know, it doesn't take a conspiracy analyst like our ilk to figure it out.
[03:27:01.707 --> 03:27:03.328]  I mean, it's just clear now.
[03:27:03.328 --> 03:27:05.408]  And I just feel it.
[03:27:06.467 --> 03:27:08.428]  Just like righteous indignation.
[03:27:08.428 --> 03:27:11.210]  Well, you can feel the evil growing, but here's the thing.
[03:27:11.210 --> 03:27:14.812]  Good is growing every opposite... Newtonian physics.
[03:27:14.812 --> 03:27:16.854]  For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[03:27:16.854 --> 03:27:25.379]  So, you feeling angry and upset and focused and your discernment increasing is because as the devil comes into the world, God's going to come into the world through you.
[03:27:25.899 --> 03:27:34.502]  So as long as you just stay focused and reach out to others and tell the truth and follow what God's telling you to do, this is the great contest because God had to give us free will.
[03:27:34.502 --> 03:27:35.883]  People say, oh, God's a sadist.
[03:27:35.883 --> 03:27:37.544]  No, God isn't a sadist.
[03:27:37.544 --> 03:27:40.745]  God had to give us free will to be new independent creatures from Him.
[03:27:41.502 --> 03:27:44.284]  That's heavy and it's painful just like having children.
[03:27:44.284 --> 03:27:47.046]  You have children with your wife, they're going to face a whole world of things.
[03:27:47.046 --> 03:27:48.267]  They're going to go through adversity.
[03:27:48.267 --> 03:27:50.949]  They're going to probably get cancer and have a heart attack when they're old and die.
[03:27:50.949 --> 03:27:56.233]  He's like, well, I'm going to commit my kids, but that's part of life and that's part of the free will.
[03:27:56.233 --> 03:27:59.855]  And everything is what God does through us is God's work.
[03:27:59.855 --> 03:28:03.238]  And so you see the beauty and the mastery of it because the spirit doesn't die.
[03:28:03.238 --> 03:28:06.060]  We're going to be with all those kids and our grandparents, everybody.
[03:28:06.600 --> 03:28:08.042]  Literally, spiritually, forever.
[03:28:08.042 --> 03:28:13.690]  We're going to break into that next level when we die, and it's going to be, we're going to thank God all day that God
[03:28:14.807 --> 03:28:22.933]  Was willing to go through the pain to create his children and then have them go through pain so that they grow up and chose to be with God.
[03:28:22.933 --> 03:28:31.620]  Because we have free will, because God respects us so much that he would let this horrible, wicked, devil system attack his very children.
[03:28:31.620 --> 03:28:34.662]  Like the Bible says, God loves a sparrow in the field.
[03:28:34.662 --> 03:28:36.404]  Think how much God thinks about you.
[03:28:36.404 --> 03:28:38.645]  I apologize to Raymond and Bob, but I'm not gonna...
[03:28:39.747 --> 03:28:41.650]  Crap on Papper, who I really want to hear from.
[03:28:41.650 --> 03:28:42.391]  He's taking over.
[03:28:42.391 --> 03:28:43.713]  He wants to take those calls he can.
[03:28:43.713 --> 03:28:44.754]  But that's it.
[03:28:44.754 --> 03:28:47.819]  War Room coming up with Owen at 3 o'clock Central.

[03:29:54.463 --> 03:29:57.546]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.

[03:31:58.913 --> 03:32:07.475]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:32:07.475 --> 03:32:10.456]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:32:10.456 --> 03:32:12.196]  How can I solve that problem?

[03:32:56.763 --> 03:32:59.386]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.115 --> 03:33:21.938]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:21.938 --> 03:33:29.264]  I am Tom Papert, God Emperor Trump on Facebook, KCTU-TV 5 here in Wichita, Kansas, filling in for Alex.
[03:33:29.264 --> 03:33:33.527]  Thank you so much to Alex and everyone at InfoWars for giving me this opportunity.
[03:33:33.527 --> 03:33:39.051]  And I apologize to those callers we didn't get to, but I know Alex is much more fun to talk to than I am.
[03:33:39.051 --> 03:33:40.132]  So I've got...
[03:33:40.692 --> 03:33:52.822]  To kind of follow up on what Alex has been talking about today, this ridiculous, pedophilic drag queen hour, these vampires who exist in our midst, they're obviously also in government.
[03:33:52.822 --> 03:33:54.303]  They're also in politics.
[03:33:54.303 --> 03:33:57.525]  Some of them are running for president or are about to.
[03:33:57.525 --> 03:34:00.328]  The big story that I want to cover, our first one for the day,
[03:34:01.028 --> 03:34:04.471]  Joe Biden, the scandal that just will not quit.
[03:34:04.471 --> 03:34:05.992]  Now he's attempting to make light of it.
[03:34:05.992 --> 03:34:08.014]  You've got him sniffing these women's hair.
[03:34:08.014 --> 03:34:10.616]  You've got him caressing children's face.
[03:34:10.616 --> 03:34:14.099]  There's viral videos going back decades of this now.
[03:34:14.099 --> 03:34:18.023]  And it's something that those of us on the right, we've known about it for a long time.
[03:34:18.023 --> 03:34:22.246]  We are all old hands at this because Joe Biden has always been creepy.
[03:34:22.246 --> 03:34:26.410]  But all of a sudden now it's in the media and Joe Biden thinks he's going to make light of it.
[03:34:26.410 --> 03:34:27.951]  That seems to be the new strategy.
[03:34:28.291 --> 03:34:31.136]  We've got the article up at bigleaguepolitics.com.
[03:34:31.136 --> 03:34:34.882]  I also write there, he gave me permission to touch him.
[03:34:34.882 --> 03:34:38.587]  Biden hugs kids during bizarre event.
[03:34:39.378 --> 03:34:46.043]  Can you just imagine if President Trump, when he said, grab him by the you know what, if he had said, oh, well, it's just funny.
[03:34:46.043 --> 03:34:47.004]  Let's laugh about it.
[03:34:47.004 --> 03:34:47.625]  Ha ha.
[03:34:47.625 --> 03:34:48.586]  It's no big deal.
[03:34:48.586 --> 03:34:50.887]  That would have been a train wreck.
[03:34:50.887 --> 03:34:57.433]  But now Joe Biden, who is getting ready to run for president any day now, gets to say things like, he gave me permission to touch him.
[03:34:57.433 --> 03:34:58.353]  All right.
[03:34:58.353 --> 03:35:01.316]  Everyone knows I like kids better than people.
[03:35:02.071 --> 03:35:05.776]  And if you just watch this, it's everybody he comes in contact with.
[03:35:05.776 --> 03:35:07.598]  The guy is too physical.
[03:35:07.598 --> 03:35:11.022]  He has no personal space boundaries whatsoever.
[03:35:11.022 --> 03:35:18.512]  And one thing that has really bothered me, as this has broken the last few days, is nobody is talking about the children.
[03:35:18.912 --> 03:35:34.470]  You have all of these adult women, some of them in their 20s, 30s, 40s, who are coming forward to say, Joe Biden made me feel uncomfortable when he did X, Y, Z. But then you go online and there's dozens and dozens of pictures of children.
[03:35:34.970 --> 03:35:37.031]  Being caressed by Joe Biden.
[03:35:37.031 --> 03:35:42.994]  And I mean, you can say it's not sexual contact, but would you let this stranger go up and touch your child?
[03:35:42.994 --> 03:35:52.879]  Would you sit in a room with your child and Joe Biden and not be in panic mode the whole time about what type of physical contact is going to happen in that space?
[03:35:53.619 --> 03:36:00.681]  I don't think anybody on left, right, or center, except maybe the lunatics who take their kids to the Drag Queen Story Hour.
[03:36:00.681 --> 03:36:02.982]  Maybe they would have no problem with Alex Jones being there.
[03:36:02.982 --> 03:36:05.223]  But it is, frankly, shocking.
[03:36:05.223 --> 03:36:06.163]  And he kept going.
[03:36:06.163 --> 03:36:12.525]  He said, when talking about the event organizer, I just wanted to let you know that I had permission to hug Lonnie.
[03:36:12.525 --> 03:36:13.786]  I had permission.
[03:36:13.786 --> 03:36:14.986]  He's joking about it.
[03:36:14.986 --> 03:36:17.847]  He shoves it right into our faces.
[03:36:17.847 --> 03:36:21.108]  He knows what he's doing is bizarre and inappropriate.
[03:36:21.588 --> 03:36:22.609]  But there's no problem.
[03:36:22.609 --> 03:36:35.985]  The audience was actually laughing at the jokes, according to reports, despite Biden's ongoing battle with now, I think it's up to seven women who say that he made them uncomfortable by touching them inappropriately.
[03:36:35.985 --> 03:36:37.667]  Five women have come out publicly.
[03:36:38.547 --> 03:36:46.435]  During his speech, he complained about what he sees as a lack of appreciation for the American worker trying to style himself as President Trump.
[03:36:46.435 --> 03:36:56.966]  I really think that because in these imaginary leftist universe, they think that Trump sexually assaults women with no recourse, which is of course completely untrue.
[03:36:56.966 --> 03:37:01.711]  He was bragging to other men that women would willingly let him do something that we won't say on air.
[03:37:02.706 --> 03:37:10.594]  And so now I think he's really trying to cast himself as the Trump archetype, that it's okay, we're just going to laugh about it and move on.
[03:37:10.594 --> 03:37:14.658]  He said, we've gotten so damn sophisticated, so damn elitist.
[03:37:14.658 --> 03:37:19.923]  I hate the way things have changed in the last 15 to 20 years, echoing a lot of what President Trump talks about.
[03:37:19.923 --> 03:37:22.026]  But you know, he's not talking about political correctness.
[03:37:22.746 --> 03:37:29.912]  That's part of the beauty here, I think, is this is a little bit like Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals, the situation with Joe Biden.
[03:37:29.912 --> 03:37:38.018]  You have the left, which says that unverified reports from 25, 30 years ago can be used to keep somebody off the Supreme Court.
[03:37:38.018 --> 03:37:43.742]  That Trump talking in a bus when he's going on what essentially is a shock jock turn TV show.
[03:37:44.162 --> 03:37:47.705]  That this is reasons why we can't have right-wingers in office.
[03:37:47.705 --> 03:37:52.648]  And then the same exact thing happens to Joe Biden and suddenly it's, I hate the way things have changed.
[03:37:52.648 --> 03:37:54.810]  I hate the way the world is going.
[03:37:54.810 --> 03:37:59.073]  We need to get rid of this political correctness because now it affects him.
[03:38:01.255 --> 03:38:04.517]  Speaking of vampires, that is exactly what this is to me.
[03:38:04.517 --> 03:38:12.080]  You have somebody who goes up and touches people, and in his weird little apology video, he says it's, well, that's how I show people I listen.
[03:38:12.080 --> 03:38:14.041]  That's how I show people I care.
[03:38:14.041 --> 03:38:18.864]  I go and I grab them by the waist, as he did Hillary Clinton, and I don't let go.
[03:38:19.765 --> 03:38:32.240]  It's weird, and it reminds me of, to bring another sicko into this, Ed Buck, the guy who has been tangentially related to the deaths of numerous black men who died in his apartment.
[03:38:33.326 --> 03:38:35.106]  Usually of a drug overdose.
[03:38:35.106 --> 03:38:39.027]  And some men have come forward saying that Ed Buck feeds off their energy.
[03:38:39.027 --> 03:38:43.328]  He feeds off the fantastic energy of young black gay men.
[03:38:43.328 --> 03:38:45.768]  He pays them so he can take them to his apartment.
[03:38:45.768 --> 03:38:46.909]  This is all alleged, by the way.
[03:38:46.909 --> 03:38:47.949]  None of this is proven.
[03:38:47.949 --> 03:38:52.490]  This is what the so-called victims, apparent victims, alleged victims say happens.
[03:38:52.490 --> 03:38:58.651]  He pays them to come to his apartment so he can inject them with drugs and feed off their energy.
[03:38:59.446 --> 03:39:05.853]  And this is something that, as Alex pointed out and several of the callers have pointed out, this is something that's been happening since the dawn of time.
[03:39:05.853 --> 03:39:10.978]  You have these evil people who get high off causing harm to the innocent.
[03:39:10.978 --> 03:39:13.080]  And if they can do it to children, all the better.
[03:39:13.080 --> 03:39:16.063]  If they can do it to young black men, all the better.
[03:39:16.063 --> 03:39:18.265]  That's what they get off from.
[03:39:18.265 --> 03:39:19.086]  And another
[03:39:19.927 --> 03:39:24.393]  Really kind of breaking story that we have up from yesterday at Big League Politics.
[03:39:24.393 --> 03:39:28.398]  This seems to be a common denominator with Democrats.
[03:39:28.398 --> 03:39:30.320]  Something that they all just keep stepping in.
[03:39:30.320 --> 03:39:31.882]  They all just keep getting caught in.
[03:39:31.882 --> 03:39:33.824]  Kirsten Gillibrand.
[03:39:33.824 --> 03:39:38.890]  It turns out her father worked for the infamous NXIVM cult.
[03:39:39.491 --> 03:39:53.334]  The sex cult, which shut down after, with a lot of help I should note, from InfoWars' own Roger Stone, who went in basically undercover to help get the disgusting sex cult shut down.
[03:39:53.334 --> 03:39:57.595]  And of course the fake news media likes to spin it as Roger Stone was involved in the sex cult.
[03:39:57.595 --> 03:39:59.235]  No, he helped destroy it.
[03:39:59.235 --> 03:40:00.415]  He demolished the thing.
[03:40:00.415 --> 03:40:02.336]  He said it was disgusting, terrible, too much.
[03:40:02.336 --> 03:40:03.716]  He's talked about it on InfoWars.
[03:40:04.296 --> 03:40:06.637]  Which, of course, he is now no longer allowed to do.
[03:40:06.637 --> 03:40:08.238]  They've taken his First Amendment away from him.
[03:40:08.238 --> 03:40:17.741]  But Kirstjen Gillibrand, who, if she gets her way, will be the first female president of the United States, the female Democrat senator.
[03:40:17.741 --> 03:40:24.384]  Her lobbyist father, Doug Rutnick, was employed by the sex cult, according to court documents.
[03:40:24.384 --> 03:40:32.647]  An eyewitness actually described how Gillibrand sat at the NXIVM table at a Hillary Clinton fundraiser.
[03:40:32.647 --> 03:40:33.808]  And one must ask,
[03:40:34.619 --> 03:40:37.400]  They're attending Hillary Clinton fundraisers?
[03:40:37.400 --> 03:40:40.901]  Just how interwoven and interconnected is all this?
[03:40:40.901 --> 03:40:44.783]  And by the way, this story is something that started out kind of out of left field.
[03:40:44.783 --> 03:40:46.563]  Before you know it, Fox News is reporting it.
[03:40:46.563 --> 03:40:47.784]  Before you know it, it's everywhere.
[03:40:47.784 --> 03:40:48.664]  It's on the Daily Caller.
[03:40:48.664 --> 03:40:49.824]  It's on Daily Wire.
[03:40:49.824 --> 03:40:50.605]  It's on Breitbart.
[03:40:50.605 --> 03:41:02.349]  Because this is insanity that these people who are affiliated with a sex cult, these metaphorical vampires, are trying to run the country.
[03:41:03.607 --> 03:41:06.928]  It's absolutely mind-boggling to those of us with our eyes open.
[03:41:06.928 --> 03:41:13.249]  Maybe to the average member of the public it's not, but that's why the InfoWars audience is so important.
[03:41:13.249 --> 03:41:18.770]  And on that note, I do have to remind everybody, because Alex Jones says he forgets to plug all the time, and it's true, he does.
[03:41:18.770 --> 03:41:21.570]  He gets so wrapped up in the news that the plugs just don't come out.
[03:41:21.570 --> 03:41:24.671]  It is so important to support this InfoWars.
[03:41:24.671 --> 03:41:31.532]  Support websites that are showing that women running for president are apparently sickos!
[03:41:31.532 --> 03:41:32.792]  Or at least connected to sickos.
[03:41:33.450 --> 03:41:36.392]  So InfoWarsStore.com, some of the best deals I've ever seen.
[03:41:36.392 --> 03:41:39.894]  I've been following Alex very closely for about four years now.
[03:41:39.894 --> 03:41:43.496]  I've known about him for a decade prior to that, ever since I was a young kid.
[03:41:43.496 --> 03:41:46.298]  But right now, these are some of the best deals you will ever see.
[03:41:46.298 --> 03:41:50.340]  60% off major products, including the flagship Brain Force.
[03:41:50.720 --> 03:41:54.363]  Free shipping all over the site, site-wide.
[03:41:54.363 --> 03:41:59.727]  It is honestly one of the best opportunities to stock up that I have seen in some time.
[03:41:59.727 --> 03:42:05.612]  And it's all for the Save the First Amendment, Stop Big Tech Censorship special.
[03:42:05.612 --> 03:42:12.517]  And of course, as usual, when I guest host the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show here, I have two of my favorite products, at least.
[03:42:12.757 --> 03:42:14.079]  See, I need to stock up as well.
[03:42:14.079 --> 03:42:21.612]  This is a good opportunity for me to break out the debit card and go to InfoWarsStore.com because as you can see, I've got my alpha male right here.
[03:42:21.612 --> 03:42:23.796]  I've got my super, I'm sorry, my X2.
[03:42:25.208 --> 03:42:27.490]  Deep Earth Iodine Crystals.
[03:42:27.490 --> 03:42:30.232]  Both absolutely fantastic products.
[03:42:30.232 --> 03:42:32.113]  I'm also a big fan of Supermail Vitality.
[03:42:32.113 --> 03:42:34.915]  If it's still available, get it while you can.
[03:42:34.915 --> 03:42:41.279]  There's some rumors that they're going to be able to source it again, but it's all so important to support Alex Jones, support the InfoWar.
[03:42:41.279 --> 03:42:43.701]  Do not let the globalists win.
[03:42:43.701 --> 03:42:47.884]  And you do that by, again, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:42:47.884 --> 03:42:48.905]  We'll be back.
[03:42:48.905 --> 03:42:49.925]  I'm Tom Pepper.
[03:42:49.925 --> 03:42:51.306]  Facebook's gone Emperor Trump.
[03:42:51.306 --> 03:42:53.348]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:53.348 --> 03:42:53.668]  And now,
[03:42:53.888 --> 03:42:58.411]  Through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[03:42:58.411 --> 03:43:01.334]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.
[03:43:01.334 --> 03:43:03.955]  So this is the best deal we've ever offered.
[03:43:03.955 --> 03:43:05.537]  Free shipping storewide.
[03:43:05.537 --> 03:43:07.398]  That's free shipping storewide.
[03:43:07.398 --> 03:43:08.639]  Free shipping storewide.
[03:43:08.639 --> 03:43:10.801]  50% off all the supplements.
[03:43:10.801 --> 03:43:13.002]  A bunch of other great deals as well.
[03:43:13.002 --> 03:43:14.103]  Double Patriot points.
[03:43:14.103 --> 03:43:17.005]  Instead of 5% on each order, towards your next order, you get 10%.
[03:43:18.266 --> 03:43:19.726]  Right there on your profile.

[03:43:24.928 --> 03:43:27.109]  That's 20% off.

[03:43:30.510 --> 03:43:33.150]  Most of these products are lost liters.
[03:43:33.150 --> 03:43:35.071]  So I want to thank you all for supporting the InfoWar.
[03:43:35.071 --> 03:43:40.073]  I want to encourage you today to get great products in a 360 win at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:43:40.073 --> 03:43:41.213]  Voting with our feet.
[03:43:41.213 --> 03:43:42.433]  Voting with our dollars.
[03:43:42.433 --> 03:43:43.674]  Voting with our mouths.
[03:43:43.674 --> 03:43:44.454]  Voting with our speech.
[03:43:45.134 --> 03:43:46.438]  Voting with our action.
[03:43:46.438 --> 03:43:48.001]  Free shipping storewide.
[03:43:48.001 --> 03:43:49.886]  That's free shipping storewide.
[03:43:49.886 --> 03:43:52.211]  Free shipping storewide at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:43:54.366 --> 03:43:55.787]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:43:55.787 --> 03:43:57.688]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:43:57.688 --> 03:43:58.288]  It is.
[03:43:58.288 --> 03:44:03.170]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:44:03.170 --> 03:44:04.511]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:44:04.511 --> 03:44:06.332]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:44:06.332 --> 03:44:08.813]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:44:08.813 --> 03:44:10.453]  Brain, body, heart.
[03:44:10.453 --> 03:44:11.914]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[03:44:11.914 --> 03:44:13.275]  You've got the children's.
[03:44:13.275 --> 03:44:14.395]  You've got the adults.
[03:44:14.395 --> 03:44:15.396]  You've got the krill oil.
[03:44:15.396 --> 03:44:18.177]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are
[03:44:18.217 --> 03:44:18.757]  It's really strong.
[03:44:18.757 --> 03:44:21.379]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oils is the best.
[03:44:21.379 --> 03:44:22.699]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:44:22.699 --> 03:44:23.480]  And I'm sorry.
[03:44:23.480 --> 03:44:24.560]  You want something like this?
[03:44:24.560 --> 03:44:25.541]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:44:25.541 --> 03:44:27.462]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:44:27.462 --> 03:44:28.062]  It's so good.
[03:44:28.062 --> 03:44:28.683]  In my view.
[03:44:28.683 --> 03:44:31.024]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:44:31.024 --> 03:44:33.705]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[03:44:33.705 --> 03:44:37.107]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:44:37.107 --> 03:44:41.650]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:44:44.619 --> 03:44:50.643]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:44:50.643 --> 03:44:51.344]  I just can't do it!
[03:44:57.552 --> 03:44:59.393]  I just have to say something, man.
[03:44:59.393 --> 03:45:03.255]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:45:03.255 --> 03:45:04.696]  It just gets old, man.
[03:45:04.696 --> 03:45:07.117]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[03:45:07.117 --> 03:45:09.438]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:45:09.438 --> 03:45:13.440]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:45:13.440 --> 03:45:15.882]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:45:16.742 --> 03:45:19.424]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:45:19.424 --> 03:45:20.786]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[03:45:20.786 --> 03:45:21.907]  Us being shut down?
[03:45:21.907 --> 03:45:23.388]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:45:23.388 --> 03:45:24.449]  You know what, Alex?
[03:45:24.449 --> 03:45:25.570]  Put him on pause again.
[03:45:25.570 --> 03:45:26.671]  Hey, Frank!
[03:45:26.671 --> 03:45:32.315]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:45:32.315 --> 03:45:36.839]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:45:36.839 --> 03:45:39.982]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:45:39.982 --> 03:45:40.442]  You understand?
[03:45:40.442 --> 03:45:42.083]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:45:42.083 --> 03:45:43.204]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:45:44.205 --> 03:45:49.789]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[03:45:49.789 --> 03:45:50.529]  Do you understand?
[03:45:50.529 --> 03:45:52.150]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:45:52.150 --> 03:45:54.651]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[03:45:54.651 --> 03:45:57.553]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[03:45:57.553 --> 03:45:59.554]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[03:45:59.554 --> 03:46:02.476]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[03:46:02.476 --> 03:46:05.198]  InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[03:46:05.759 --> 03:46:08.882]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[03:46:08.882 --> 03:46:10.444]  I didn't invent all this.
[03:46:10.444 --> 03:46:17.010]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[03:46:17.010 --> 03:46:19.813]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[03:46:20.868 --> 03:46:24.211]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[03:46:24.211 --> 03:46:27.134]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[03:46:27.134 --> 03:46:28.836]  That sends chills up my spine.
[03:46:28.836 --> 03:46:42.390]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[03:46:42.390 --> 03:46:44.331]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[03:46:44.952 --> 03:46:50.236]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[03:46:50.236 --> 03:46:57.762]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[03:46:57.762 --> 03:47:00.425]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.569 --> 03:47:21.553]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:21.553 --> 03:47:28.279]  I am Tom Papert, Facebook's God Emperor Trump, KCTU-TV 5 here in Wichita, Kansas.
[03:47:28.279 --> 03:47:32.703]  You know, it has been a little bit of a dark edition of the Alex Jones Show here.
[03:47:32.703 --> 03:47:36.527]  I've watched most of the show today here, making sure I would stay consistent with Alex.
[03:47:36.527 --> 03:47:43.473]  But one thing I like to do on my program on Facebook, God Emperor Trump Live, is leave everybody with a little bit of uplifting news.
[03:47:43.493 --> 03:47:44.134]  We're good to go.
[03:47:55.808 --> 03:48:03.134]  I do want to, again, give you a little uplifting news and a reminder that we are the silent majority in this country.
[03:48:03.134 --> 03:48:10.059]  Even under Trump, many of us are still silent because we don't want to be attacked in public, fired, ostracized, any number of terrible things.
[03:48:10.059 --> 03:48:13.602]  We don't want the vampiric armies to assemble against us.
[03:48:13.602 --> 03:48:15.784]  But this is just an example.
[03:48:17.456 --> 03:48:19.858]  A look into our silent majority.
[03:48:19.858 --> 03:48:25.861]  Tucker Carlson on Fox News, one of the few Fox News hosts who really gets it, I think.
[03:48:25.861 --> 03:48:27.802]  Of course, he's been on InfoWars before.
[03:48:27.802 --> 03:48:30.944]  He seems to be a friend of Alex Jones and the InfoWars team.
[03:48:30.944 --> 03:48:38.428]  Tucker Carlson is currently getting more viewers than all of CNN's primetime content combined.
[03:48:38.428 --> 03:48:44.291]  Put it all together, and there are about 400,000 people less than Tucker Carlson.
[03:48:44.991 --> 03:48:50.813]  That is the power of Fox News when they decide to put a patriot on the air.
[03:48:50.813 --> 03:48:58.476]  It's, frankly, if they were financially motivated, they would probably have all patriots on the air, but we all know that they probably have a hidden agenda.
[03:48:58.476 --> 03:49:05.298]  So, this is, to me, just beautiful evidence that the people are waking up.
[03:49:05.298 --> 03:49:07.179]  You know, I've run the numbers before.
[03:49:07.179 --> 03:49:11.901]  Of course, it's all rough estimates, and now since Alex Jones has been unpersoned so severely,
[03:49:13.022 --> 03:49:13.623]  You never know.
[03:49:13.623 --> 03:49:18.567]  It's hard to get the actual nuts and bolts now because everything InfoWars is very intelligent.
[03:49:18.567 --> 03:49:20.408]  It's all proprietary information now.
[03:49:20.408 --> 03:49:24.931]  But Alex Jones probably reaches even more than Tucker Carlson.
[03:49:24.931 --> 03:49:37.201]  And it's probably growing every single day as more TV and radio affiliates get on the air, as people figure out how to skirt the big tech systems and show Alex Jones content on the big tech platforms without their permission.
[03:49:38.340 --> 03:49:40.902]  It's a good reminder that you're not alone out there.
[03:49:40.902 --> 03:49:47.347]  Regardless of how isolated the left tries to make you feel, there are lots of people just like you.
[03:49:47.347 --> 03:49:59.557]  So, the next story I want to talk about, we've talked again, it's been kind of a dark episode, talking about these men wearing dresses, doing the drag queen story hour, where they want to sit on your toddler on their lap.
[03:49:59.557 --> 03:50:04.902]  These, many times, at least twice that we know of, convicted child rapists.
[03:50:05.754 --> 03:50:11.818]  Who molest and do violent sexual violence against six-year-olds.
[03:50:11.818 --> 03:50:12.879]  These are the people who come out.
[03:50:12.879 --> 03:50:16.962]  Now the Pope has weighed in on this pedophile scandal.
[03:50:16.962 --> 03:50:17.803]  Oh wait, no he hasn't.
[03:50:17.803 --> 03:50:18.483]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:50:18.483 --> 03:50:19.204]  I'm sorry.
[03:50:19.204 --> 03:50:21.025]  Pedophile Pope alleged
[03:50:22.438 --> 03:50:25.780]  Set sights on the scourge of fake news.
[03:50:25.780 --> 03:50:34.026]  That's right, the Catholic Church barely does a day go by without another sexual grooming, pedophilia, gay sex scandal comes out.
[03:50:34.026 --> 03:50:35.107]  Well, don't worry.
[03:50:35.107 --> 03:50:38.649]  The Pope has his priorities straight.
[03:50:38.649 --> 03:50:43.132]  Because you see, fake news is one of the worst things that can possibly happen.
[03:50:43.132 --> 03:50:46.154]  This is one of those stories where it's if you don't laugh, you cry.
[03:50:47.469 --> 03:50:59.374]  He has only once, to my knowledge, publicly said anything about the pedophile and sexual assault scandals that have rocked the Vatican for decades now and continue through the 2010s.
[03:50:59.374 --> 03:51:14.401]  But he says there are huge economic interests operating in the digital world, capable of exercising forms of control that are as subtle as they are invasive, creating mechanisms for the manipulation of conscience and the democratic process.
[03:51:15.242 --> 03:51:24.632]  You read that, that word salad, and is he talking about when Jack Dorsey on Twitter shadowbans us so the average Twitter user isn't even able to see my tweets?
[03:51:24.632 --> 03:51:26.994]  No Twitter user is able to see Alex Jones' tweets.
[03:51:26.994 --> 03:51:28.796]  He's been, again, un-person.
[03:51:28.796 --> 03:51:35.343]  Is he talking about on Facebook, where they de-boost conservative content so it's seen by less people?
[03:51:35.623 --> 03:51:36.083]  We're good to go.
[03:51:55.172 --> 03:51:57.253]  No, no, no, of course not.
[03:51:57.253 --> 03:52:00.354]  He's talking about what he calls fake news.
[03:52:00.354 --> 03:52:09.437]  He says these closed circuits facilitate the spread of fake news and false information, fomenting prejudice and hate.
[03:52:09.437 --> 03:52:14.539]  What a joke the Catholic Church has become under this man and even before him.
[03:52:14.539 --> 03:52:19.561]  Controversy after controversy after controversy and he wants to fight fake news.
[03:52:19.561 --> 03:52:21.282]  You've got a Muslim invasion of Europe.
[03:52:21.815 --> 03:52:25.721]  You've got a world that will never be the same under his watch.
[03:52:25.721 --> 03:52:26.362]  And what does he do?
[03:52:26.362 --> 03:52:32.372]  He kisses the feet of these refugees of peace and he fights fake news.
[03:52:32.372 --> 03:52:33.894]  It is absolutely comical.
[03:52:33.894 --> 03:52:36.959]  It is a bit like a clown world to be living in.
[03:52:37.722 --> 03:52:40.323]  So this last story I want to spend some time on.
[03:52:40.323 --> 03:52:44.425]  This is, I believe, the beta test for what happened to Alex Jones.
[03:52:44.425 --> 03:52:49.507]  I think we discovered it at BigLeaguePolitics.com, and this was the beta test.
[03:52:49.507 --> 03:52:55.710]  And I can't find anybody else who had this happen, but a Chinese MMA star was unpersoned
[03:52:56.130 --> 03:53:01.652]  After basically proving that Tai Chi sucks, we've got the article up on BigLeaguePolitics.com.
[03:53:01.652 --> 03:53:15.378]  This man, whose name I'm going to terribly butcher, and I apologize to any Chinese viewers in the audience, Xiao Dong, I'm going to guess, he saw on the Chinese state-run media, he saw a man doing Tai Chi.
[03:53:15.378 --> 03:53:18.059]  And he was using Tai Chi to beat all kinds of people.
[03:53:18.499 --> 03:53:21.864]  Well, this guy did some research and found out that it was actually all fake.
[03:53:21.864 --> 03:53:24.227]  It's Chuck Norris tier production.
[03:53:24.227 --> 03:53:27.031]  Which actually, Chuck Norris was not fake.
[03:53:27.031 --> 03:53:28.674]  But it's a Hollywood production.
[03:53:29.753 --> 03:53:36.656]  Done in China to make Tai Chi, which is of course a Chinese art, look really, really impressive.
[03:53:36.656 --> 03:53:40.457]  And so he finds this out and he challenges this guy named Wei Li.
[03:53:40.457 --> 03:53:42.658]  He challenges him to a fight.
[03:53:42.658 --> 03:53:46.480]  Flies halfway across the massive country of China to fight him.
[03:53:46.480 --> 03:53:47.800]  It's all on camera.
[03:53:47.800 --> 03:53:51.822]  And the guy doing Tai Chi goes down in about nine seconds, if that.
[03:53:51.822 --> 03:53:54.623]  The ref had to get between them before serious harm could be done.
[03:53:55.363 --> 03:53:56.883]  And so this guy's thinking, ha!
[03:53:56.883 --> 03:53:57.243]  See?
[03:53:57.243 --> 03:53:58.644]  China's going to move forward.
[03:53:58.644 --> 03:54:02.884]  We're going to accept mixed martial art as a legitimate form of martial arts.
[03:54:02.884 --> 03:54:04.525]  This is going to be fantastic.
[03:54:04.525 --> 03:54:05.645]  He's at the lead.
[03:54:05.645 --> 03:54:06.785]  Everything's great.
[03:54:06.785 --> 03:54:09.046]  Until he turned on the TV.
[03:54:09.046 --> 03:54:16.627]  And he saw on the TV the Chinese state-run media repeating over and over and over again that he disgraced China.
[03:54:16.627 --> 03:54:19.928]  That he brought a foreign force to invade China.
[03:54:19.928 --> 03:54:21.828]  And he hates Chinese traditions.
[03:54:22.722 --> 03:54:27.525]  And then before you know it, he was purged off the Chinese social media.
[03:54:27.525 --> 03:54:28.985]  He was purged off the internet.
[03:54:28.985 --> 03:54:31.467]  He can no longer upload videos.
[03:54:31.467 --> 03:54:40.992]  He has been totally unpersoned for winning a fight against a guy doing Tai Chi.
[03:54:40.992 --> 03:54:44.054]  And then you think, wow, when did this happen?
[03:54:44.054 --> 03:54:45.154]  And you do a little bit of digging. 2015.
[03:54:47.640 --> 03:54:55.705]  Three years before Alex Jones would be unpersoned in the exact same way.
[03:54:55.705 --> 03:54:56.705]  And for what?
[03:54:56.705 --> 03:54:58.586]  This guy won a fight!
[03:54:58.586 --> 03:55:04.970]  This guy proved that, not that the West is the best, but that mixed martial arts beats tai chi!
[03:55:06.201 --> 03:55:07.302]  And he was unpersoned.
[03:55:07.302 --> 03:55:09.344]  Now, what was Alex Jones unpersoned for?
[03:55:09.344 --> 03:55:11.325]  I still can't get anybody to tell me.
[03:55:11.325 --> 03:55:17.271]  Some people say it's because he posted the video of the guy who lost his temper and pushed the kid down.
[03:55:17.271 --> 03:55:18.652]  Some people say it's because of this.
[03:55:18.652 --> 03:55:20.093]  Some people say it's because of that.
[03:55:20.093 --> 03:55:26.739]  And eventually, if you push them hard and long enough, they'll say, oh, Zandy Hook, which, of course, Alex Jones has spoken about at great length.
[03:55:26.739 --> 03:55:29.501]  Nobody can figure out what he did wrong.
[03:55:29.501 --> 03:55:30.602]  Nobody can figure out why.
[03:55:31.368 --> 03:55:50.059]  Yet, all together, after the media condemned him, after the media said that he is a conspiracy theorist and a vile man and an evil person with a heart of darkness, as Hillary Clinton said, then Big Tech, in lockstep with the Democrats and their allies in the media, decided he had to go.
[03:55:50.059 --> 03:55:56.183]  So I think this is absolutely fascinating that Big Tech apparently had their beta test in China.
[03:55:56.980 --> 03:55:59.603]  Where we know that Google has essentially sold to China.
[03:55:59.603 --> 03:56:03.786]  Facebook desperately wanted to and Hong Kong kicked them out.
[03:56:03.786 --> 03:56:04.607]  And this is it.
[03:56:04.607 --> 03:56:05.588]  This is the beta test.
[03:56:05.588 --> 03:56:13.896]  This is what they did to see if the public, granted the Chinese public is a little bit different than the West, if the public would be okay with somebody being totally unpersonal.
[03:56:13.896 --> 03:56:14.777]  It turns out they are.
[03:56:15.618 --> 03:56:18.100]  And so now it's happened to Alex Jones, but the fight isn't over.
[03:56:18.100 --> 03:56:19.601]  The West is not China.
[03:56:19.601 --> 03:56:27.388]  And as this man said, he said, yes, I criticize many people online, but have you ever considered that what I said was right?
[03:56:28.305 --> 03:56:34.051]  That is the perfect analogy to Alex Jones, who keeps getting proven right time and time again.
[03:56:34.051 --> 03:56:40.538]  InfoWars truly is next year's news today, sometimes next decade's news today.
[03:56:40.538 --> 03:56:45.944]  That's why I am so glad that I get invited on these Friday afternoons to guest host the fourth hour.
[03:56:46.224 --> 03:56:47.944]  Again, I am Tom Pampert.
[03:56:47.944 --> 03:56:50.725]  This has been the Alex Jones Show.

[03:57:09.389 --> 03:57:12.391]  I have ever seen Alex Jones offer.
[03:57:12.391 --> 03:57:15.192]  I sit there and I wonder, how does he make money on any of this stuff?
[03:57:15.192 --> 03:57:19.054]  Of course, I've got my own website as well, and I'm thinking the margins must be non-existent.
[03:57:19.054 --> 03:57:21.355]  So take advantage of this opportunity.
[03:57:21.355 --> 03:57:24.017]  And of course, you can watch me weeknights, 8 p.m.
