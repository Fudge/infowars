[00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:05.051]  We've got it.
[00:00:05.091 --> 00:00:11.536]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:15.759]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:17.881]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:21.684]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:30.830]  I wouldn't be surprised if, for example, this week on Friday, he is going to be delivering what I think are going to be his indictments, the final indictments.
[00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.071]  I would not be surprised if there were a number of indictments that still were going to come down the pike.
[00:00:35.552 --> 00:00:38.753]  There are indictments in this president's future.
[00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:39.753]  That's a bombshell.
[00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:40.613]  The bombshell.
[00:00:40.693 --> 00:00:41.413]  This bombshell.
[00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:42.354]  Drop the bombshell.
[00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:43.714]  Bombshell accusation.
[00:00:43.894 --> 00:00:45.075]  Bombshell accusation.
[00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:45.475]  This is...
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.022]  Evidence of willingness to commit collusion.
[00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:57.009]  If this BuzzFeed News report is true, then we are likely on our way to possible impeachment proceedings.
[00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.332]  If this story is true, we must begin impeachment proceedings.
[00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:01.794]  This is suborning perjury.
[00:01:01.814 --> 00:01:04.396]  I think there's no question it's an impeachable offense.
[00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:08.778]  And at that point, we are in high crimes and misdemeanor, and we are in impeachment territory.
[00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.420]  This president needs to be impeached!
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.841]  Impeachment is the remedy.
[00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:15.082]  I mean, the president can't... It's the only remedy.
[00:01:15.222 --> 00:01:18.404]  The spirit of what Trump did is clearly treasonous.
[00:01:18.524 --> 00:01:23.407]  This is moving into perjury, false statements, and even potentially treason.
[00:01:23.487 --> 00:01:25.088]  There's outright treason.
[00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:26.729]  I mean, there is no question.
[00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:28.410]  I think he's feeling the noose around his neck.
[00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.011]  The noose is tightening.
[00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:32.532]  And I think they're shocked that the noose is tightening.
[00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:33.953]  He feels the noose is tightening.
[00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.234]  The noose is tightening.
[00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:42.317]  The sound of hoof beats of all those investigations catching up with Donald Trump must be loud in his ears.
[00:01:42.858 --> 00:01:47.300]  He may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.821]  People might go to jail.
[00:01:49.383 --> 00:01:50.263]  You're exactly right.
[00:01:50.283 --> 00:01:51.104]  For the rest of their lives.
[00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:52.524]  I think they're all going to jail.
[00:01:52.684 --> 00:01:55.845]  Well, I think they're all going to end up together in prison, and maybe that's a good thing.
[00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:56.285]  Oh my God!
[00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:59.667]  He has no idea that he's going down.
[00:01:59.927 --> 00:02:04.168]  You're confident that at least some Trump associates will wind up in jail?
[00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:06.169]  If I was betting, I would say yes.
[00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.409]  Donald Trump Jr.
[00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:08.830]  gave us the dots.
[00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.271]  All we have to do is to connect them to see where this is going.
[00:02:18.688 --> 00:02:19.889]  Ha ha ha!
[00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.190]  You see the Earth, right?
[00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.390]  You got it.
[00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:27.292]  Restore the Republic?
[00:02:27.312 --> 00:02:29.854]  You got it.
[00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:32.035]  Relaunch the economy and the family?
[00:02:32.355 --> 00:02:35.256]  You got it.
[00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:35.817]  You are a ghost?
[00:02:37.177 --> 00:02:39.698]  It's all coming out!
[00:02:54.304 --> 00:03:03.831]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, March 25th, 2019, Global Transmission.
[00:03:05.593 --> 00:03:15.360]  And folks have made these compilations of the Democrats all going off talking points in the corporate media, regurgitating them about the walls are closing in, no doubt it's treason, he's a Russian agent.
[00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:22.886]  But I was thinking just watching that video compilation that's linked up on DrudgeReport.com, which is an excellent video compilation, off the top of my head though,
[00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.855]  During the break, I'm going to run back, talk to some of the crew, and remind them of 10 or 15 clubs I remember where it was worse than that.
[00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:32.216]  Russian scum!
[00:03:32.256 --> 00:03:33.237]  We're run by Russia!
[00:03:33.477 --> 00:03:34.337]  Trump's a Russian agent!
[00:03:34.558 --> 00:03:35.758]  Alex Jones is a Russian agent!
[00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.779]  Joy Behar!
[00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:37.920]  We just got the news!
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.942]  General Flynn admits they're all Russian agents!
[00:03:40.242 --> 00:03:41.102]  Trump's going to prison!
[00:03:41.343 --> 00:03:42.103]  Yay!
[00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:48.568]  I mean, we're going to put the real definitive
[00:03:51.112 --> 00:03:51.873]  We're good to go.
[00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:12.196]  The establishment isn't going to give up yet.
[00:04:13.076 --> 00:04:18.877]  We have decisive findings here by major international study groups, by groups that crunch the numbers, top professors.
[00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:23.238]  Google and the rest of the big tech is absolutely stealing elections.
[00:04:25.018 --> 00:04:28.639]  They beta tested in 2018 and they're going to steal it in 2020.
[00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:30.759]  This is the real collusion.
[00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:31.840]  This is the real fraud.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.300]  This is the real meddling.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.541]  And so we've got to get Trump moving on this direction.
[00:04:37.581 --> 00:04:39.281]  He already is going after
[00:04:40.532 --> 00:04:47.855]  The brainwashing command bases where they create the cult members, the cadet centers, the nurseries, at the universities.
[00:04:47.895 --> 00:04:55.837]  He's already going after the censorship there, but now he must move, must move decisively, against the Chi-Com enemy, Google.
[00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:57.178]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.578 --> 00:04:58.358]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:58.678 --> 00:04:59.719]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:05:03.755 --> 00:05:07.637]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[00:05:08.418 --> 00:05:12.220]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:19.685]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:22.827]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[00:05:23.707 --> 00:05:27.190]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:31.492]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[00:05:31.672 --> 00:05:33.213]  We are the power structure.
[00:05:33.693 --> 00:05:34.734]  We are the inventors.
[00:05:35.314 --> 00:05:36.354]  We are the trailblazers.
[00:05:37.094 --> 00:05:39.935]  And the globalists understand that.
[00:05:40.476 --> 00:05:46.438]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[00:05:47.598 --> 00:05:51.420]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[00:05:52.444 --> 00:06:01.417]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at importstore.com.
[00:06:01.557 --> 00:06:02.919]  Something everybody should take advantage of.
[00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:35.298]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:43.545]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:43.565 --> 00:06:49.049]  So, we have written literally hundreds of articles the last two years about the attempted Deep State criminal takedown.
[00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:57.004]  I'm the 45th President of the United States, and now the whole criminal operation has been exposed.
[00:06:57.064 --> 00:07:07.691]  The emails, the text messages, the premeditation, the fact that Hillary and Obama, when Trump was President-elect within 48 hours, launched the plan.
[00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:14.515]  All of that, ladies and gentlemen, is now coming out in a very, very big way.
[00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:20.599]  And we have the President of the United States coming out.
[00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:36.705]  And pointing out that now there needs to be criminal investigations of the individuals and the groups that tried to take the presidency down in an attempted coup d'etat.
[00:07:37.686 --> 00:07:38.606]  That's what this is!
[00:07:39.607 --> 00:07:42.268]  And it sounds extreme to say that, but the Democrats admitted
[00:07:43.817 --> 00:07:44.957]  That that is what they were doing.
[00:07:44.977 --> 00:07:54.201]  But first I want to go to Joy Behar because there's been a lot of compilations out there of them celebrating and saying he's a Russian agent and he's going to go to prison and he needs to be killed.
[00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:57.942]  But none of them have added this little jewel.
[00:07:58.943 --> 00:08:03.785]  And throughout the day we're going to be playing some of the jewels that people have forgotten about in the last two years.
[00:08:03.805 --> 00:08:04.085]  Here it is.
[00:08:05.676 --> 00:08:06.737]  Breaking news.
[00:08:06.997 --> 00:08:07.658]  Oh my god.
[00:08:07.678 --> 00:08:09.179]  Oh, breaking news.
[00:08:09.359 --> 00:08:21.928]  ABC News Brian Ross is reporting Michael Flynn promised full cooperation to the Mueller team and is prepared to testify that as a candidate Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians!
[00:08:22.028 --> 00:08:25.070]  Yay!
[00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:26.692]  Our president's a traitor.
[00:08:26.712 --> 00:08:29.654]  We'll be able to kill the economy now.
[00:08:34.776 --> 00:08:35.937]  America was never great.
[00:08:36.937 --> 00:08:38.338]  America will never be great.
[00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:48.703]  From the very same state that these women are sitting up there like vultures on top of a 50-story building at the VIEW television platform.
[00:08:49.164 --> 00:08:49.584]  I've been there.
[00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:58.735]  I mean, even if it was true he's a Russian agent, you would get really upset about your president doing that and think, what's going to come of this?
[00:08:58.795 --> 00:08:59.796]  It's going to wreck the country.
[00:08:59.816 --> 00:09:00.817]  Of course, none of it was true.
[00:09:01.497 --> 00:09:02.297]  They're the globalists.
[00:09:02.618 --> 00:09:04.279]  The Democrats, the corporate media, Hollywood.
[00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:05.419]  They're in bed with the shycoms.
[00:09:05.599 --> 00:09:13.004]  They're the ones demoralizing the nation, constantly saying how much it sucks, and how racist we are, and how everything's horrible, and how we're falling apart.
[00:09:14.045 --> 00:09:17.249]  And Maxine Waters saying, don't move your factories back here.
[00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:20.213]  I'm going to reverse what Trump did.
[00:09:21.054 --> 00:09:26.160]  I'm going to bring all of the regulations back into the United States.
[00:09:27.222 --> 00:09:29.985]  And then the economy's going straight up, starts going sideways.
[00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:33.164]  Because the Democrats announced, we're not open for business!
[00:09:33.884 --> 00:09:36.827]  We all got stock in China, and India, and Mexico!
[00:09:37.147 --> 00:09:39.149]  We're about mounting America's head on the wall!
[00:09:39.349 --> 00:09:41.290]  Don't you try to make this country great again!
[00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.873]  We're gonna stop that Russian agent from making the country great again!
[00:09:47.455 --> 00:09:59.925]  But while we all celebrate the fact that Mueller came up empty despite all the people they tried to frame, all the illegal spying, all the people they tried to put in jail for made-up things to get him to turn against the President and lie,
[00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:04.595]  They couldn't get anybody to do it because there was nothing there.
[00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:13.740]  Even when they got people like Cohen to flip, there was nothing for him to connect anything to the President because it was all made up by that dirty criminal.
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.381]  And so, Balazi Ford's failed.
[00:10:18.162 --> 00:10:18.882]  Who else has failed?
[00:10:20.863 --> 00:10:22.044]  Congressman Schiff has failed.
[00:10:23.525 --> 00:10:24.385]  Michael Moore has failed.
[00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:25.346]  Hillary Clinton's failed.
[00:10:25.706 --> 00:10:26.526]  Bill Clinton's failed.
[00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:27.687]  Barack Obama's failed.
[00:10:28.207 --> 00:10:29.208]  The Globalists have failed.
[00:10:32.867 --> 00:10:33.468]  All these people.
[00:10:34.128 --> 00:10:38.392]  The list just goes on and on of all the hoaxers and all the liars.
[00:10:38.432 --> 00:10:39.272]  McCain has failed.
[00:10:44.917 --> 00:10:47.179]  It's incredible what's been going on.
[00:10:50.501 --> 00:10:55.045]  Now, you have to ask yourself, what is going to come next?
[00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:58.348]  Because we can sit here and look at the lay of the land
[00:10:59.554 --> 00:11:03.536]  And understand the Democrats are not going to ever give up.
[00:11:05.576 --> 00:11:07.017]  They've launched their Balazi Four.
[00:11:10.238 --> 00:11:11.699]  They've launched their Stormy Daniels.
[00:11:13.659 --> 00:11:16.741]  They've launched their Russiagate hoaxes.
[00:11:18.641 --> 00:11:20.762]  And they're going to launch more of them.
[00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:25.744]  But people now have seen the fact that this is the party of Jussie Smollett.
[00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:28.647]  This is the party of fraud.
[00:11:28.707 --> 00:11:29.807]  This is the party of liars.
[00:11:31.468 --> 00:11:42.853]  But if Trump thinks he can just now try to get the economy moving forward and that they're not going to come back after him and that he can basically try to be neutral and hopefully the Democrats become sane, he's made a big mistake.
[00:11:42.914 --> 00:11:44.114]  We now must discuss.
[00:11:44.614 --> 00:11:46.135]  We now must talk about.
[00:11:46.635 --> 00:11:53.178]  We now must debate what needs to be done.
[00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.839]  And justice is always the course.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.000]  And Trump
[00:11:57.386 --> 00:11:58.267]  Didn't hint at that.
[00:11:58.347 --> 00:12:03.515]  He spelled it out when he talked about the fact that there's total exoneration.
[00:12:04.216 --> 00:12:06.079]  Says illegal takedown failed.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.041]  Steve Watson article.
[00:12:09.511 --> 00:12:12.393]  On newswars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:12:12.873 --> 00:12:13.894]  And I would ask you to get that up.
[00:12:13.914 --> 00:12:34.868]  People need to hear from the president himself getting on Air Force One yesterday, laying this out and saying it needs to be looked at how the Democratic Party from Obama right down to Hillary organized this entire operation against the president.
[00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:36.589]  Here's the president.
[00:12:38.613 --> 00:12:53.916]  After so many people have been so badly hurt, after not looking at the other side, where a lot of bad things happened, a lot of horrible things happened, a lot of very bad things happened for our country.
[00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:57.851]  It was just announced.
[00:12:58.671 --> 00:13:00.833]  There was no collusion with Russia.
[00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:04.015]  The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
[00:13:04.035 --> 00:13:06.557]  There was no collusion with Russia.
[00:13:07.197 --> 00:13:11.140]  There was no obstruction and none whatsoever.
[00:13:13.021 --> 00:13:17.344]  And it was a complete and total exoneration.
[00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:22.308]  It's a shame that our country had to go through this.
[00:13:23.832 --> 00:13:31.217]  To be honest, it's a shame that your president has had to go through this before I even got elected.
[00:13:31.737 --> 00:13:32.277]  It began.
[00:13:33.358 --> 00:13:34.539]  And it began illegally.
[00:13:35.419 --> 00:13:37.821]  And hopefully somebody's going to look at the other side.
[00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:42.984]  This was an illegal takedown that failed.
[00:13:43.985 --> 00:13:48.768]  And hopefully somebody's going to be looking at the other side so it's complete.
[00:13:49.938 --> 00:13:53.960]  Exoneration, no collusion, no obstruction.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:54.881]  Thank you very much.
[00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:55.541]  Thank you.
[00:13:56.262 --> 00:13:57.302]  And let's expand on that.
[00:13:58.783 --> 00:14:00.444]  Now, the deep state's scared.
[00:14:01.024 --> 00:14:06.147]  With big tech, it's openly not working with our military, with our state governments, it's working with the Chinese.
[00:14:06.488 --> 00:14:10.210]  The decision's been made, the money's been spent, the transference of power is already happening.
[00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.852]  But Trump and America and other nationalists around the world woke up
[00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:17.230]  At the 11th hour, and now it's beginning to reverse.
[00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.211]  And a lot of people were confident in the globalist system.
[00:14:20.231 --> 00:14:21.012]  They thought we were done.
[00:14:21.332 --> 00:14:22.372]  Now they're not so confident.
[00:14:22.933 --> 00:14:27.294]  You're going to see Democrats turn against each other like rats leaving a sinking ship.
[00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:30.656]  This is still a very, very dangerous period we're in.
[00:14:31.336 --> 00:14:38.279]  But as Trump tweeted out last year, now that Russia collusion is a proven lie, when do the trials for treason begin?
[00:14:38.719 --> 00:14:44.142]  Yeah, you can't leave all these dangerous crooks who are actually in bed with foreign governments walking around.
[00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:49.533]  Because you're now aiding and abetting them if you don't do the right thing and go after them.
[00:14:49.553 --> 00:14:52.354]  We're going to go to break.
[00:14:52.374 --> 00:14:58.176]  We're going to come back with more of these clips and get into the Google censorship now confirmed that stole the 2018 elections.
[00:14:58.496 --> 00:15:01.657]  They've had top scientists, universities crunch the numbers, professors.
[00:15:02.558 --> 00:15:02.918]  They did it.
[00:15:03.438 --> 00:15:06.319]  And it turns out Google bragged to Hillary they could deliver the election to her.
[00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:10.821]  It's just the tsunami was so big of Trump that he barely won.
[00:15:12.042 --> 00:15:14.803]  You know, he had a landslide, so they miscalculated.
[00:15:14.903 --> 00:15:18.105]  Now, they're openly stealing at levels never before seen.
[00:15:18.365 --> 00:15:19.045]  We're going to go to break.
[00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:23.087]  Please don't forget, through the end of this month, that's how we fund our operation, plus their great products.

[00:17:06.397 --> 00:17:08.198]  I just have to say something, man.
[00:17:08.218 --> 00:17:11.260]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.201]  It just gets old, man.
[00:17:13.541 --> 00:17:15.242]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:17:15.942 --> 00:17:18.023]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:17:18.263 --> 00:17:22.265]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:17:22.285 --> 00:17:24.766]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:27.928]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:17:28.268 --> 00:17:29.389]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:17:29.629 --> 00:17:30.509]  Us being shut down?
[00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:31.770]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:33.251]  You know what, Alex?
[00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:34.371]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[00:17:34.391 --> 00:17:35.231]  Hey, Frank!
[00:17:35.492 --> 00:17:40.854]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:17:41.154 --> 00:17:45.436]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:17:45.676 --> 00:17:48.537]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:17:48.797 --> 00:17:49.178]  You understand?
[00:17:49.278 --> 00:17:50.538]  I need your help, Frank!

[00:20:06.051 --> 00:20:08.693]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:35.009 --> 00:20:35.669]  Wide South.
[00:20:37.609 --> 00:20:41.150]  The Globalists and their new Chai Com masters have removed President Trump.
[00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.111]  He was a Russian agent.
[00:20:44.131 --> 00:20:47.632]  And now, America's not gonna be great again.
[00:20:47.652 --> 00:20:49.012]  Brought to you by Hillary Clinton.
[00:20:49.833 --> 00:20:51.173]  She'll bring America to heel.
[00:20:55.339 --> 00:20:56.959]  Oh, but that's an alternate reality!
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.720]  We were all told about.
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.041]  But it didn't happen, did it?
[00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:06.422]  This is a syndicated radio show that also simulcasts via television.
[00:21:07.942 --> 00:21:12.083]  I started doing that about 18 years ago.
[00:21:13.203 --> 00:21:14.544]  I launched streaming the show.
[00:21:15.603 --> 00:21:17.584]  So that people can actually see what I was talking about.
[00:21:17.604 --> 00:21:24.569]  Because I'd say, oh, I've got a congressional report here that says we're going to hand the entire national park system over to the UN.
[00:21:25.349 --> 00:21:26.310]  And people wouldn't believe me.
[00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:28.992]  So I started simulcasting video.
[00:21:30.413 --> 00:21:32.154]  And now here we are today so I can show people.
[00:21:32.774 --> 00:21:33.795]  Like this stack of news.
[00:21:33.855 --> 00:21:35.216]  Document cam shot, please.
[00:21:36.176 --> 00:21:39.879]  Just go to any search engine, type in deep state coup against Trump.
[00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:47.417]  And then put in Infowars.com, you'll get hundreds of articles, going back to times like May 10th, 2017.
[00:21:47.658 --> 00:21:56.890]  You can actually find me on January 20th, 2017, saying that they'd try it, and exactly who was running it, because they actually funded it.
[00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:58.312]  Obama signed an executive order.
[00:22:00.097 --> 00:22:01.838]  See, I had the exact blueprint.
[00:22:02.138 --> 00:22:03.338]  It wasn't that I was so smart.
[00:22:03.978 --> 00:22:14.021]  Obama put a stay-behind group, part of the CIA, part of the Justice Department, part of the Ford and Carnegie endowment, to unseat the president.
[00:22:14.541 --> 00:22:17.762]  Brit Hume last week, why he told Tucker Carlson that.
[00:22:18.523 --> 00:22:23.744]  He said, yes, there was a deep state national emergency declared through different bodies in the government.
[00:22:23.764 --> 00:22:25.525]  They tried to unseat the president.
[00:22:26.165 --> 00:22:29.686]  Oh, Brit Hume tells us that two years later.
[00:22:30.942 --> 00:22:32.522]  By the way, Brit Hume knew that day one.
[00:22:34.163 --> 00:22:35.663]  Back then, he was more on the fence about Trump.
[00:22:35.703 --> 00:22:36.984]  They thought Trump might be removed.
[00:22:37.024 --> 00:22:39.864]  But see, now, now they failed.
[00:22:41.125 --> 00:22:41.605]  Here it is.
[00:22:41.665 --> 00:22:44.565]  Deep State pushes coup against Trump over Comey firing.
[00:22:45.686 --> 00:22:46.906]  That was right after Comey was fired.
[00:22:46.946 --> 00:22:48.186]  I laid out exactly what happened.
[00:22:49.507 --> 00:22:51.967]  He broke it all down in the videos and articles posted there.
[00:22:52.567 --> 00:22:59.169]  And that's why they wanted us taken off in the summer, because we were saying everything they were doing.
[00:23:01.021 --> 00:23:04.382]  And that scared the living daylights out of them.
[00:23:05.242 --> 00:23:06.623]  Get him off, get him off.
[00:23:06.883 --> 00:23:08.103]  You heard the CEO of YouTube.
[00:23:08.704 --> 00:23:11.124]  I wanted to get Alex Jones off and I got him off.
[00:23:11.524 --> 00:23:13.565]  And now I want to get all the other conservatives off.
[00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:15.406]  She just admits it on television.
[00:23:16.146 --> 00:23:18.127]  In front of a huge auditorium of people.
[00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:24.369]  And they're not going to stop now.
[00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:27.950]  They went and made it all up, folks.
[00:23:29.192 --> 00:23:37.997]  They had congressional hearings where they said, Alex Jones works for the Russians.
[00:23:39.658 --> 00:23:42.300]  And members of Congress lean down and they go, I want him off air.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:48.004]  And they say, sir, we were working on it at lunch.
[00:23:48.584 --> 00:23:49.725]  You think I'm going to play the clips again?
[00:23:50.425 --> 00:23:51.486]  Imagine you're watching that going.
[00:23:53.407 --> 00:23:56.629]  I mean, I could be somebody that they found with dead bodies in my basement.
[00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:58.230]  I would get to face my accusers.
[00:24:00.283 --> 00:24:04.066]  Oh, I'm an evil talk show host that has big American flags flying behind me.
[00:24:04.827 --> 00:24:15.514]  And it's totally for free market, totally for the Second Amendment, totally for religious rights, totally for sovereignty, of a flaming nationalist Americana.
[00:24:17.776 --> 00:24:18.917]  And I'm the bad guy.
[00:24:19.297 --> 00:24:22.680]  It's just, imagine the inversion of reality.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.342]  Shame thing, saying Trump's against America?
[00:24:28.393 --> 00:24:29.794]  Yeah, Congressman Quigley.
[00:24:29.874 --> 00:24:35.398]  I mean, there's like 15 hearings you can pull up, but the worst are in the Armed Services Committee in the House.
[00:24:37.119 --> 00:24:41.722]  I mean, it's flat out scary when they've got the military civilians sitting in there.
[00:24:42.323 --> 00:24:49.388]  These are people that, you know, direct the military to overthrow governments, kill people and break things, lying about you saying you're a traitor.
[00:24:49.888 --> 00:24:51.069]  No, let me tell you something.
[00:24:51.829 --> 00:24:56.773]  All of you lying scumbags saying I'm a traitor to this country, you're the traitors.
[00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.811]  Oh, and here's the good news.
[00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:01.652]  In fact, I want to play it next segment.
[00:25:01.672 --> 00:25:03.473]  I only played this last week once.
[00:25:03.513 --> 00:25:04.354]  I should play it ten times.
[00:25:05.114 --> 00:25:17.162]  General Dunford and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense laying out that to say that Google's taking us over is an understatement, and we're totally infiltrated by them, and it's treason.
[00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:20.024]  And Google works for the CHICOMS.
[00:25:21.585 --> 00:25:21.925]  Of course.
[00:25:24.238 --> 00:25:36.225]  The culture at Google, the culture at major universities, the culture at Evergreen, U, and Harvard, and Yale, and all these places is, America is evil.
[00:25:36.826 --> 00:25:38.107]  Communism is good.
[00:25:39.227 --> 00:25:42.449]  Half the millennials in polls say they're communists or socialists.
[00:25:44.531 --> 00:25:45.451]  We have cancer.
[00:25:45.811 --> 00:25:46.512]  Let's admit it.
[00:25:47.844 --> 00:25:59.073]  And the fact that Dunford has to sit up there and explain that he went and met with Google and met with an auditorium of their employees and said, we're the good guys, not the chai-coms.
[00:26:00.554 --> 00:26:06.139]  And it doesn't mean our military or our government's perfect, because it can be hijacked and run by people like Barack Obama.
[00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:12.964]  That's why you can't let too much power transfer into any centralized system, because it always gets abused.
[00:26:13.145 --> 00:26:15.446]  And the most centralized thing in the world
[00:26:16.243 --> 00:26:20.946]  That is the most cutthroat evil that anyone has ever imagined is the Chinese Communist.
[00:26:21.226 --> 00:26:21.587]  Bye!
[00:26:23.268 --> 00:26:24.669]  Orders of magnitude!
[00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:33.098]  And our universities are publicly bought off by their Confucius Institutes and all the rest of it.
[00:26:33.498 --> 00:26:38.841]  I've talked to high-level folks at the Pentagon, CIA, Naval Intelligence, you name it, but I can do my own research.
[00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:40.622]  Hell, I knew this stuff before they were on to it.
[00:26:40.642 --> 00:26:53.369]  I'm not bragging, it's just... It's like I had Jack Masobicon, who's heavily dialed in, and I said, what's the order of magnitude that your colleagues that you've come up with, he used to be in China, used to live there,
[00:26:55.551 --> 00:27:00.361]  And how much bigger is the Chinese infiltration of the United States compared to Russia?
[00:27:00.381 --> 00:27:02.927]  I said 50%?
[00:27:02.967 --> 00:27:02.927]  100%?
[00:27:02.987 --> 00:27:03.408]  He goes, now 1000%.
[00:27:09.275 --> 00:27:13.860]  Because when the Russians try to buy you off, they go, would you like to be in business with us?
[00:27:13.901 --> 00:27:15.322]  Would you like Russia?
[00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:16.564]  That's not how China does it.
[00:27:16.604 --> 00:27:20.568]  They make you give all your technology, all your codes, everything to them.
[00:27:21.109 --> 00:27:22.791]  They make you move over to China.
[00:27:22.971 --> 00:27:28.198]  They usually make you marry a Chinese woman who's got family over there they'll kill if you don't play ball.
[00:27:28.988 --> 00:27:33.151]  You ever wonder why so many tech heads who are really gay have a Chinese wife and Chinese kids?
[00:27:33.591 --> 00:27:35.573]  Because they've made the deal, folks.
[00:27:35.913 --> 00:27:38.575]  And by the way, if you don't know about that, that's the olden days.
[00:27:39.295 --> 00:27:42.237]  Back when two kingdoms would merge, they'd make their kids marry.
[00:27:43.058 --> 00:27:44.158]  Or it wasn't a real alliance.
[00:27:44.759 --> 00:27:46.260]  Like, our grandkids are gonna be the same.
[00:27:47.501 --> 00:27:49.202]  And this 200-year war is about to end.
[00:27:50.443 --> 00:27:51.564]  So I'm explaining this.
[00:27:52.164 --> 00:27:54.626]  China is absorbing us.
[00:27:56.254 --> 00:27:57.635]  We're not merging with China.
[00:27:58.015 --> 00:27:59.756]  We're being eaten by China.
[00:28:01.458 --> 00:28:10.324]  And now, right as the last parts of us were going into the Chinese dragon's mouth, the American eagle's trying to fly out of there.
[00:28:11.484 --> 00:28:15.347]  And it's flapping its wings and it's almost getting out of there, and the Democrats are panicking.
[00:28:15.367 --> 00:28:16.968]  They're like, no!
[00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:19.210]  Our whole ethos is hating America!
[00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:22.632]  Go to any Democrat event.
[00:28:23.772 --> 00:28:25.013]  I always knew they hated America.
[00:28:25.033 --> 00:28:34.179]  I knew some of them did, but I've gone to Democrat events, and they'll be like, Alex, get out of here, boo, boo, boo, when the event's called.
[00:28:34.199 --> 00:28:37.421]  Donald Trump, Alex Jones, and the Age of Fake News.
[00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:40.103]  They have a big public event downtown Austin, blocking the streets.
[00:28:41.391 --> 00:28:48.234]  I show up, and they're booing me, but as soon as I said, America's back, you'll never stop it, they literally started going, AHHHHH!
[00:28:48.574 --> 00:28:49.554]  AHHHHH!
[00:28:49.795 --> 00:28:53.896]  And people started running up, going, I like to have sex with kids, and licking my face and hitting me.
[00:28:54.096 --> 00:28:56.738]  And I looked into the bleachers, and the people were just flopping around like,
[00:29:03.761 --> 00:29:06.764]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:29:07.124 --> 00:29:13.050]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:19.335]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:29:19.656 --> 00:29:22.278]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:29:22.558 --> 00:29:30.063]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:29:30.083 --> 00:29:38.288]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[00:29:38.889 --> 00:29:43.152]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[00:29:44.016 --> 00:29:47.618]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:29:47.818 --> 00:29:53.782]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[00:29:54.763 --> 00:30:03.628]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[00:30:04.168 --> 00:30:08.351]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[00:30:08.391 --> 00:30:10.112]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[00:30:11.203 --> 00:30:13.026]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[00:30:13.046 --> 00:30:14.328]  It was the last run.
[00:30:14.348 --> 00:30:15.330]  It's been sold out for two months.
[00:30:16.394 --> 00:30:17.255]  How is X2 back?
[00:30:17.755 --> 00:30:21.358]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[00:30:21.838 --> 00:30:24.901]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get it anymore.
[00:30:25.501 --> 00:30:35.529]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep-earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[00:30:35.609 --> 00:30:39.533]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[00:30:39.973 --> 00:30:41.094]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[00:30:41.514 --> 00:30:45.836]  You need to do research into Iodine and the Iodine Conspiracy for yourself.
[00:30:46.316 --> 00:30:48.097]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[00:30:48.538 --> 00:30:49.818]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[00:30:50.359 --> 00:30:52.620]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.421]  What, like a 4.9 star on Power Reviews?
[00:30:56.041 --> 00:30:59.543]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[00:31:00.384 --> 00:31:02.825]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[00:31:03.866 --> 00:31:06.188]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[00:31:06.648 --> 00:31:18.996]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[00:31:19.517 --> 00:31:22.579]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[00:31:22.599 --> 00:31:23.739]  So iodine is amazing.
[00:31:23.779 --> 00:31:24.360]  It's important.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.601]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[00:31:26.661 --> 00:31:27.202]  They'll hurt you.
[00:31:27.562 --> 00:31:28.262]  This is pure.
[00:31:28.543 --> 00:31:29.243]  This is clean.
[00:31:29.583 --> 00:31:30.364]  This is amazing.
[00:31:30.704 --> 00:31:32.485]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[00:31:34.026 --> 00:31:37.649]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[00:31:37.969 --> 00:31:42.732]  X2 Original from the very first original manufacturer.
[00:31:43.112 --> 00:31:49.657]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:49.717 --> 00:31:52.659]  As I said, get your pre-orders in, week, week and a half.
[00:31:52.919 --> 00:32:01.685]  It's being labeled right now, it's already been bottled, and we are going to have it for you, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:01.745 --> 00:32:02.746]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:32:04.537 --> 00:32:05.878]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:32:05.958 --> 00:32:07.740]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:08.260]  It is.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.864]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:32:13.345 --> 00:32:14.466]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:32:14.486 --> 00:32:16.448]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:32:16.508 --> 00:32:18.830]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.012]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[00:32:22.093 --> 00:32:23.314]  You've got the children's.
[00:32:23.454 --> 00:32:24.415]  You've got the adults.
[00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:25.476]  You've got the krill oil.
[00:32:25.576 --> 00:32:28.939]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[00:32:28.959 --> 00:32:31.341]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[00:32:31.701 --> 00:32:33.562]  It'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry.
[00:32:33.742 --> 00:32:34.662]  You want something like this?
[00:32:34.742 --> 00:32:35.602]  You don't get stuff for free.
[00:32:35.702 --> 00:32:37.563]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:32:37.623 --> 00:32:38.763]  It's so good, in my view.
[00:32:38.843 --> 00:32:40.844]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:32:40.884 --> 00:32:45.505]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:32:47.266 --> 00:32:51.827]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:32:54.790 --> 00:33:00.598]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:33:00.818 --> 00:33:01.599]  I just can't do it!
[00:33:07.007 --> 00:33:09.610]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:29.692]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:48.324 --> 00:34:02.193]  All right, folks, we're going to come back in the next segment.
[00:34:02.213 --> 00:34:04.274]  I'm going to be able to digest this and comment on it.
[00:34:05.935 --> 00:34:10.498]  But just during the break, I was back there looking at news articles, collating things with the producers.
[00:34:11.764 --> 00:34:14.046]  And they said, hey, this is broken in like the last hour.
[00:34:14.066 --> 00:34:17.208]  And I'm like, wow, that's why we got to Google my name like every 10 minutes around here.
[00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:34.940]  I've really sat back and I've talked to my lawyers and I've said, we've got to send cease and desist letters to NPR and all these channels because they all know full well that I believe Sandy Hook happened for years and that I've never sent anybody to their houses.
[00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:40.985]  And they had NPR shows the last two weeks in a row with family members and others on the show saying,
[00:34:41.991 --> 00:34:44.632]  Please stop saying it didn't happen and please stop sending people to our houses.
[00:34:44.652 --> 00:34:48.133]  And I'm like, well it really sounds horrible if I'm doing that, right?
[00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:49.373]  But I'm not.
[00:34:49.393 --> 00:34:55.135]  And so it's the media always opening the old wounds and then saying I'm doing it.
[00:34:56.456 --> 00:34:59.737]  And saying our whole career is based on Sandy Hook when it's something I barely covered.
[00:35:01.445 --> 00:35:04.726]  And then, boom, in the last hour, dozens of articles have already broke.
[00:35:05.346 --> 00:35:08.627]  And my heart goes out to this fella and whatever happened.
[00:35:08.647 --> 00:35:09.768]  They're not sure it's suicide.
[00:35:09.808 --> 00:35:10.708]  They're saying it may be.
[00:35:11.728 --> 00:35:14.269]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman.
[00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:17.290]  Never even said Jeremy Richman's name.
[00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:19.250]  It's in the lawsuit against me.
[00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.931]  He was suing me.
[00:35:20.431 --> 00:35:21.691]  But there, I just said his name.
[00:35:22.571 --> 00:35:25.972]  Sandy Hook dad kills himself as defamation suit continues.
[00:35:26.393 --> 00:35:27.173]  This one says that.
[00:35:27.633 --> 00:35:29.653]  Other local news says they believe that's what it is.
[00:35:29.974 --> 00:35:31.014]  And then it's a picture of me.
[00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:34.711]  So this is what happens, folks.
[00:35:34.731 --> 00:35:35.972]  They make my whole identity this.
[00:35:36.912 --> 00:35:38.173]  This poor guy is dead.
[00:35:40.154 --> 00:35:46.378]  And there's an image of me, Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman, Sandy Hook, that kills himself as defamation suit continues.
[00:35:53.262 --> 00:35:56.464]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[00:35:58.447 --> 00:36:00.709]  Father of Sandy Hook shooting victim found dead.
[00:36:01.129 --> 00:36:06.914]  Here's the news, WTFSB saying they don't know, probably a suicide.
[00:36:08.196 --> 00:36:10.858]  But certainly should be looked into.
[00:36:11.799 --> 00:36:15.322]  Now they'll say, Jones says look into how he was found dead in front of the town hall.
[00:36:15.342 --> 00:36:19.766]  Yeah, you're supposed to look into murders, look into deaths, look into suicides.
[00:36:21.187 --> 00:36:22.548]  So there you go.
[00:36:22.568 --> 00:36:24.410]  Heart goes out to him and his family.
[00:36:28.387 --> 00:36:37.430]  And I'll say it again, I believe Sandy Hook happened, and I've never sent people their houses, but I just, I'm just bracing to see what the media says.
[00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.592]  I mean, they're already putting my face up on almost all these articles.
[00:36:41.652 --> 00:36:47.994]  What is it about my show that's got the system so scared?
[00:36:48.314 --> 00:36:49.875]  I mean, I want to thank the New York Times.
[00:36:51.696 --> 00:36:54.837]  Seriously, they didn't put my face up on the front of it.
[00:36:56.505 --> 00:37:01.348]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman, Sandy Hook dad kills himself as decimation suit continues.
[00:37:02.328 --> 00:37:03.309]  The New Haven Register.
[00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:04.710]  Another one.
[00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:08.952]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman, Sandy Hook dad kills himself as decimation suit continues.
[00:37:13.574 --> 00:37:15.015]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[00:37:18.417 --> 00:37:21.739]  I have never said Jeremy Richman's name.
[00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:23.060]  In fact, most of the people
[00:37:24.275 --> 00:37:25.997]  In these suits again, I never even said their names.
[00:37:26.997 --> 00:37:30.661]  And they're like 80-page lawsuits, and I read it, and most of the stuff I never even said.
[00:37:31.521 --> 00:37:42.311]  And so, that's why we know confidently, even if we don't get a fair jury down the road that goes to that, that it'll be overturned on appeal, because it'll make new public law.
[00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:50.653]  We've talked to top lawyers like Alan Dershowitz, you name it, and they agree that this is just unheard of.
[00:37:51.113 --> 00:37:53.515]  You actually read the suits versus what I actually said.
[00:37:54.316 --> 00:37:55.537]  People ask, what is this all about?
[00:37:55.577 --> 00:37:57.258]  It's about ending the First Amendment.
[00:37:57.318 --> 00:37:59.740]  It can be said that Sandy Hook is being used to go after the Second Amendment.
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:02.462]  Well, it's been successful going after the First Amendment so far.
[00:38:04.363 --> 00:38:05.664]  So, really, really sad.
[00:38:07.506 --> 00:38:12.827]  I'm just bracing for corporate media to further connect me to this poor man's death.
[00:38:13.468 --> 00:38:14.148]  This sad death.
[00:38:15.188 --> 00:38:17.829]  But this whole Sandy Hook thing has been weird from the start.
[00:38:19.429 --> 00:38:20.610]  And I believe it happened.
[00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:26.691]  And then I watch all these powerful forces that are swirling around.
[00:38:28.012 --> 00:38:32.733]  All these big law firms, the Democratic Party, and all these think tanks, universities, and groups.
[00:38:35.972 --> 00:38:40.793]  I've seen parents on the news go, we just want him to apologize before they ever sued me.
[00:38:41.333 --> 00:38:43.454]  And I said, okay, I'm not the guy that ever first said this.
[00:38:43.474 --> 00:38:44.974]  It was internet sensation.
[00:38:45.254 --> 00:38:45.734]  We covered it.
[00:38:45.754 --> 00:38:47.035]  But I said, okay, I apologize.
[00:38:47.055 --> 00:38:47.875]  I believe your kids died.
[00:38:47.895 --> 00:38:52.156]  And, uh, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry if things I said, question things hurt you.
[00:38:52.516 --> 00:38:54.976]  And that like triggered like blood in the water just.
[00:38:56.777 --> 00:39:02.038]  And so I guess that's why they always say, don't apologize, especially the left, because
[00:39:03.365 --> 00:39:06.867]  It's always turned into something different than what you did.
[00:39:07.667 --> 00:39:09.908]  And I don't blame the families.
[00:39:09.948 --> 00:39:11.029]  They've been through a lot of trauma.
[00:39:11.249 --> 00:39:14.830]  You know, it's the law firms that convinced the families to sue the dead hero teacher.
[00:39:16.011 --> 00:39:26.656]  And it's the law firms that convinced them to sue the school district, and the police, and everybody else, on and on and on, and the guy manufacturers, and the Democratic Party.
[00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:30.778]  But Hillary came out and said that I'm the Sandy Hook guy.
[00:39:32.432 --> 00:39:34.333]  And that's when I really went, uh-uh.
[00:39:34.473 --> 00:39:36.094]  Like three years ago, I said, stop it.
[00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:38.455]  That is not what I said.
[00:39:38.836 --> 00:39:39.756]  That is not what I believe.
[00:39:39.776 --> 00:39:40.597]  That's out of context.
[00:39:42.298 --> 00:39:51.903]  Because I was just sick of her trying to enrage her supporters to use me as a political weapon against Trump to build up the straw man to then hurt Trump and the country.
[00:39:52.944 --> 00:40:01.549]  And then once Hillary ran national ads, attacked me in speeches, when Trump lost, Democrats literally believe I got Trump elected.
[00:40:02.639 --> 00:40:07.663]  We were part of it, our audience was a critical part of it, but they think I'm like Godzilla attacking Tokyo.
[00:40:08.984 --> 00:40:20.994]  They really believe that I'm the Homeland character and that I've got like a thousand employees and I run the country and I've got all the answers and I'm like this evil genius.
[00:40:23.396 --> 00:40:26.899]  And the truth is way far the opposite of that.
[00:40:26.999 --> 00:40:31.363]  We're mom and pop and we're dealing with just very standard things like
[00:40:32.418 --> 00:40:36.940]  Making sure the garbage gets carried out and make sure that we fact check stories.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:42.682]  We're a very small crew of people and we absolutely make mistakes, but they're not done on purpose.
[00:40:43.182 --> 00:40:48.804]  I've never tried to go on air and lie about somebody or say something about an event because we gain from it.
[00:40:48.824 --> 00:40:51.445]  In fact, we looked at the numbers analytics.
[00:40:51.485 --> 00:40:56.146]  We lost listeners and stations entertaining that Sandy Hook could be staged.
[00:40:57.787 --> 00:41:00.968]  You don't gain stations going, hey, look at the vaccine insert.
[00:41:01.983 --> 00:41:02.823]  Says it can kill you.
[00:41:02.963 --> 00:41:03.684]  It does say that.
[00:41:04.924 --> 00:41:09.926]  But even famous Olympic athletes and people that say, hey, I took a vaccine and got real sick.
[00:41:10.186 --> 00:41:11.507]  People then death threat their kids.
[00:41:12.547 --> 00:41:15.188]  You question in this country, you get attacked.
[00:41:16.048 --> 00:41:16.989]  You get demonized.
[00:41:18.049 --> 00:41:19.750]  You go play footsie with the establishment.
[00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:21.330]  You go far.
[00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:24.031]  Now we've gone far despite all that.
[00:41:25.192 --> 00:41:25.932]  But, um,
[00:41:28.635 --> 00:41:32.716]  Again, I said I'd cover it next segment so I could think about this, but there's really nothing to think about.
[00:41:32.736 --> 00:41:34.056]  You know, my wife's an open book.
[00:41:35.057 --> 00:41:37.817]  And imagine I'm on a four minute break.
[00:41:39.138 --> 00:41:42.038]  I'm in there talking to him about posting the Joe Rogan interview that we're going to air coming up.
[00:41:42.959 --> 00:41:44.659]  Tim Fulwars.com from last week.
[00:41:44.879 --> 00:41:46.459]  He would have been live in the studio, but his plane was late.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:47.900]  It's powerful.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.680]  And they go, Hey, have you heard about this?
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.301]  This poor Sandy Hook father was found dead.
[00:41:52.321 --> 00:41:53.641]  They're not sure if it's suicide or what.
[00:41:55.902 --> 00:41:57.002]  And I'm just stepping back.
[00:41:59.946 --> 00:42:03.429]  Looking at this, shot himself in front of the town hall.
[00:42:05.971 --> 00:42:09.133]  I mean, how do I get a fair trial with stuff like this?
[00:42:10.254 --> 00:42:11.936]  I've never said this guy's name.
[00:42:15.839 --> 00:42:16.599]  Never said his name.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.101]  Until now.
[00:42:19.282 --> 00:42:23.805]  And, obviously, first it's, we don't know he's got gunshot wounds or whatever.
[00:42:23.865 --> 00:42:25.427]  Now it's, well, apparent suicide.
[00:42:26.047 --> 00:42:28.149]  I mean, is there going to be a police investigation?
[00:42:28.229 --> 00:42:29.410]  Are they going to look at the surveillance cameras?
[00:42:31.616 --> 00:42:33.237]  I mean, what happened to this guy?
[00:42:34.298 --> 00:42:38.940]  This whole Sandy Hook thing is, like, really getting even crazier.
[00:42:40.921 --> 00:42:46.725]  And the way the media has been on this since day one is what made people suspicious.
[00:42:47.765 --> 00:42:51.187]  When the media blamed all Americans for what happened, people are sick of that.
[00:42:52.808 --> 00:42:56.010]  Bad people are to blame for what happens with guns or cars or knives or baseball bats.
[00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:59.352]  But we should pray for the family of this poor gentleman.
[00:42:59.372 --> 00:43:01.293]  We pray for Jeremy Richman's family.
[00:43:02.975 --> 00:43:09.638]  It's been months and months and months since we've been able to have store-wide free shipping at Forestore.com.
[00:43:10.259 --> 00:43:19.243]  And it's been months and months since we were able to offer 50% off on our best-selling products because many of them sold out at the end of the year.
[00:43:20.144 --> 00:43:23.325]  We've gotten almost all of our best-selling products back in stock.
[00:43:24.326 --> 00:43:28.448]  And so now, for the second half of the month of March, we're going to be able to offer
[00:43:30.212 --> 00:43:35.438]  50% off all our best-selling products at fullwarslife.com, with all the supplements.
[00:43:35.478 --> 00:43:40.084]  And 50% off on many other products on the site as well, and the store-wide free shipping.
[00:43:40.184 --> 00:43:49.455]  And what's even more exciting about this is, as I told you over a year ago, we can no longer get the deep earth crystals to produce the X2 formula.
[00:43:50.319 --> 00:43:57.064]  We were able to get another form of crystals that were just as good, but it still isn't the exact same formula because it's not the exact same type.
[00:43:57.785 --> 00:43:58.605]  That's X3.
[00:43:58.966 --> 00:43:59.946]  All three different types.
[00:44:00.047 --> 00:44:00.627]  Triionine.
[00:44:00.667 --> 00:44:01.147]  It's excellent.
[00:44:01.327 --> 00:44:01.788]  We have that.
[00:44:01.828 --> 00:44:02.348]  People love it.
[00:44:02.929 --> 00:44:12.096]  But I was able to get the exact same system, the exact same crystals, the exact same formula from the original manufacturer of our iodine.
[00:44:12.336 --> 00:44:15.438]  And we now have the purest, cleanest halogen out there.
[00:44:15.458 --> 00:44:19.822]  The good halogen versus the bad halogens of fluoride and chlorine and all the rest of them.
[00:44:20.442 --> 00:44:40.722]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com now has store-wide free shipping and 50% off Rainforce Plus, 50% off Survival Shield X2, 50% off Supernova Vitality, 50% off Bodies, 50% off Alpha Power, 50% off Super Blue Products, 50% off DNA Force, 50% off Knockout.
[00:44:41.964 --> 00:44:53.294]  50% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and then again, all the other products are between 40 and 25% off, because some of the products don't have 40 or 50% you can cut off, because then you're actually losing money.
[00:44:53.814 --> 00:44:57.898]  In fact, when you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off on the next order.

[00:45:03.283 --> 00:45:08.872]  And then, oh, I almost forgot, double Patriot points at InfoWarsTore.com as well.
[00:45:08.892 --> 00:45:13.639]  So instead of five cents on every dollar, it goes towards your next purchase in your profile account.
[00:45:14.791 --> 00:45:16.132]  It's 10 cents on every dollar.
[00:45:16.433 --> 00:45:24.819]  So you add that to store-wide free shipping, you add that to 50% off, you add that to 10% off on auto ship, and then 10% off credit towards your next order.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:25.980]  That's just insane.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.483]  So this is the biggest sale we've ever done.
[00:45:29.563 --> 00:45:38.591]  It matches the sales we did year-end to clear out inventory in case the globals were able to take away our final financial processing systems.
[00:45:39.171 --> 00:45:40.191]  But now we've got backups.
[00:45:40.492 --> 00:45:41.212]  Thanks for your prayers.
[00:45:41.232 --> 00:45:42.392]  Thanks for your support.

[00:45:47.294 --> 00:45:49.315]  But we are fighting for our very existence.

[00:47:06.538 --> 00:47:09.221]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:17.363]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:47:20.154 --> 00:47:25.175]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[00:47:25.636 --> 00:47:34.018]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[00:47:34.158 --> 00:47:45.501]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[00:47:45.601 --> 00:47:47.142]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[00:47:47.938 --> 00:48:03.831]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[00:48:03.891 --> 00:48:06.153]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[00:48:06.613 --> 00:48:12.999]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[00:48:15.686 --> 00:48:17.808]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:48:18.328 --> 00:48:23.572]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:48:29.277 --> 00:48:30.478]  Well, I gotta tell you something.
[00:48:31.198 --> 00:48:41.086]  It's being reported that the father of Sandy Hook victim, who I never said his name, who was suing me, has been found dead in front of the Town Hall Courthouse.
[00:48:41.906 --> 00:48:43.668]  And I'm looking at article after article
[00:48:46.465 --> 00:48:48.106]  And you read them and it's about me.
[00:48:48.987 --> 00:48:50.528]  And it's my face.
[00:48:53.031 --> 00:48:55.593]  And so it'll now be Alex Jones killed this man.
[00:48:57.394 --> 00:48:58.675]  My questioning years ago.
[00:48:59.416 --> 00:49:00.697]  And so we've got to be taking off the air.
[00:49:02.959 --> 00:49:04.180]  That's where all this is going.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:10.665]  I mean this is this is as obvious as the day is long how the media is going to use this tragic event.
[00:49:12.206 --> 00:49:12.647]  I'll tell you.
[00:49:13.945 --> 00:49:14.805]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:49:15.626 --> 00:49:17.327]  Absolutely mind-blowing.
[00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:25.271]  It's like being in a weird dystopic nightmare film like Lost Highway or something.
[00:49:27.272 --> 00:49:29.113]  David Lynch is gonna walk out any moment.
[00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:30.353]  Lynch has been on the show before.
[00:49:33.155 --> 00:49:34.035]  It just never ends.
[00:49:35.576 --> 00:49:36.857]  And the weirdest thing is...
[00:49:38.038 --> 00:49:55.892]  I'm all over the news, I'm everywhere, doing my quote, apology tour for years, since Hillary said, I said nobody died at Sandy Hook, saying, I believe people died, I never sent people to your houses, because one of the guys that actually goes up there is crazy, he's come down here, and gotten in our face, saying we're covering up, saying Sandy Hook happened.
[00:49:56.913 --> 00:49:59.334]  So I've already dealt with some of these crazies.
[00:50:01.736 --> 00:50:07.481]  And, then though, you can't get the families and their lawyers to stop saying,
[00:50:09.454 --> 00:50:10.775]  That I'm currently doing it.
[00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:13.396]  And in that way, it's a clear and present issue.
[00:50:13.416 --> 00:50:14.856]  Like, Roku, take him off!
[00:50:15.117 --> 00:50:16.217]  He's doing it now!
[00:50:19.018 --> 00:50:20.519]  Or NPR, he won't stop!
[00:50:20.799 --> 00:50:22.440]  We just asked him to stop, but he won't.
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:23.700]  It's why we have to do it.
[00:50:24.461 --> 00:50:25.761]  It's why we have to get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:50:27.662 --> 00:50:31.364]  So, I believe people died there.
[00:50:31.684 --> 00:50:36.586]  But undoubtedly, the Democratic Party, the media, these law firms are using this to try to end the First Amendment.
[00:50:36.826 --> 00:50:38.827]  Something Democrats openly want right now.
[00:50:42.281 --> 00:50:46.323]  I mean, a bunch of the articles say his name.
[00:50:46.883 --> 00:50:48.664]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman.
[00:50:49.104 --> 00:50:53.486]  Sandy Hook dad kills himself as the defamation suit continues.
[00:50:56.267 --> 00:50:57.248]  And then it just goes on.
[00:50:57.748 --> 00:51:03.571]  Article after article with my face on the front and my name with his death.
[00:51:05.852 --> 00:51:08.073]  We have no idea whether he was even murdered at this point.
[00:51:09.585 --> 00:51:11.226]  Why would some anti-gun guy do this?
[00:51:11.286 --> 00:51:12.566]  This is really sad.
[00:51:13.286 --> 00:51:18.828]  My prayers go out to him and his family, and we wish for the truth of whatever really happened here to come out.
[00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:19.808]  We don't know yet.
[00:51:22.269 --> 00:51:24.910]  And we'll see the corporate media say outrageous lies, but it's what they do.
[00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:29.991]  And look, the good news of no collusion, the good news that I'm not a Russian agent comes out.
[00:51:32.372 --> 00:51:34.973]  And now, this happens right on time.
[00:51:37.634 --> 00:51:38.594]  Just amazing.
[00:51:40.117 --> 00:51:41.318]  And he's one of many people suing me.
[00:51:41.338 --> 00:51:42.138]  I've never said his name.
[00:51:42.198 --> 00:51:42.778]  I have now.
[00:51:44.099 --> 00:51:48.001]  And, you know, my prayers, again, for him and for his family.
[00:51:49.162 --> 00:51:52.184]  Let's go ahead and play one of the local newscasts that just came out about this.
[00:51:52.204 --> 00:51:52.504]  Here it is.
[00:51:53.945 --> 00:51:54.685]  Breaking news at noon.
[00:51:54.725 --> 00:51:59.088]  We are now learning that a father of one of the Sandy Hook victims has taken his own life this morning.
[00:51:59.508 --> 00:52:04.571]  Newtown police were called to a building in town to respond to reports of a suicide.
[00:52:05.051 --> 00:52:08.973]  We now know that Jeremy Richmond, the father of Aviel Richmond, was found dead.
[00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:12.075]  He had started a foundation in his daughter's name.
[00:52:12.555 --> 00:52:16.817]  Channel 3's Nicole Nalapa has been following this heart-wrenching story closely.
[00:52:16.837 --> 00:52:19.779]  Nicole, where does the investigation stand right now?
[00:52:20.299 --> 00:52:21.159]  Cara, you said it.
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:25.342]  It is a heart-wrenching story and heartbreaking for a community that has been hit with so much.
[00:52:25.722 --> 00:52:31.905]  Newtown police say Richmond's death appears to be a suicide and that his death does not appear to be suspicious.
[00:52:31.945 --> 00:52:33.425]  And that is all that they're saying right now.
[00:52:33.766 --> 00:52:36.267]  I'm hearing an autopsy is expected to be done later today.
[00:52:36.707 --> 00:52:38.909]  So here's what we were able to find out for you on this story.
[00:52:39.269 --> 00:52:44.213]  Newtown police, ambulance, and fire were called to Edmond Town Hall at 7 a.m.
[00:52:44.253 --> 00:52:46.414]  to investigate the report of a suicide.
[00:52:46.855 --> 00:52:52.819]  And just to be clear, Edmond Town Hall is a theater and event space in town that houses many community events.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.962]  That's where they found the body of 49-year-old Jeremy Richmond.
[00:52:56.402 --> 00:53:02.587]  He was the father of Aviel Richmond, one of the first grade students killed in the 2012 tragedy at Sandy Hook School.
[00:53:03.167 --> 00:53:12.752]  And he created the Avielle Foundation in his daughter's memory, which was a non-profit organization focused on preventing violence through brain research and community engagement.
[00:53:13.252 --> 00:53:16.114]  Police say Richman had an office at Edmond Town Hall.
[00:53:16.634 --> 00:53:25.379]  Now, this news comes after two survivors of the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, committed suicide in the past week.
[00:53:25.959 --> 00:53:33.485]  The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is open 24 hours a day, so if you or someone you know needs help, please call this number.
[00:53:33.505 --> 00:53:33.905]  1-800-273-8255.
[00:53:33.925 --> 00:53:36.327]  Live in the studio, Nicole Nalepa, Channel 3 Eyewitness News.
[00:53:46.141 --> 00:53:46.922]  Let's just say it is.
[00:53:46.962 --> 00:53:47.942]  Let's just believe mainstream media.
[00:53:47.962 --> 00:53:48.983]  We're not supposed to ever question them.
[00:53:49.263 --> 00:53:49.524]  Fine.
[00:53:50.504 --> 00:53:52.486]  We have 22 service members committing suicide a day.
[00:53:52.806 --> 00:53:53.426]  It's an epidemic.
[00:53:53.827 --> 00:53:54.547]  We've got articles here.
[00:53:54.587 --> 00:53:55.368]  It's not just you.
[00:53:55.908 --> 00:54:00.251]  New data shows more than half of young people in America don't have a romantic partner.
[00:54:00.932 --> 00:54:01.833]  They have their iPhone.
[00:54:03.274 --> 00:54:05.355]  So people are very depressed.
[00:54:05.936 --> 00:54:07.257]  The iPhones are making us depressed.
[00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:08.157]  The screen time is.
[00:54:09.018 --> 00:54:11.540]  And it's very sad.
[00:54:12.501 --> 00:54:12.941]  I know this.
[00:54:13.041 --> 00:54:14.122]  It's the corporate media.
[00:54:15.336 --> 00:54:18.979]  that says it is the worst thing on earth to question any mass event.
[00:54:20.961 --> 00:54:34.354]  And then they say that I'm questioning Sandy Hook like a parrot when I'm not, and then using my name to bring out the hurtful stories over and over and over again to hype up school shootings, which causes copycats to do it more.
[00:54:39.028 --> 00:54:41.449]  And so we don't know why he took his life or if he took his life.
[00:54:41.469 --> 00:54:44.011]  I mean, the police say that's what it's leaning towards.
[00:54:44.451 --> 00:54:53.477]  Regardless, this is very, very tragic and also very, very bizarre, obviously, and very, very sad.
[00:54:54.717 --> 00:54:58.620]  But I've told the lawyers this 50 times, and I'm just going to do it.
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:00.221]  I'm sending letters.
[00:55:01.377 --> 00:55:02.218]  I'm going to hire a service.
[00:55:02.238 --> 00:55:07.143]  I'm going to send cease and desist letters to probably a thousand media outlets, and I'm going to send it to all the lawyers.
[00:55:07.603 --> 00:55:09.165]  I've told their lawyers face-to-face, too.
[00:55:09.565 --> 00:55:16.092]  You know full well, it's been years and years since I said that it's legitimate for people to question and maybe, you know, this was staged.
[00:55:16.692 --> 00:55:17.954]  There's a past events that have been staged.
[00:55:18.614 --> 00:55:23.879]  And they do stuff like clip out where I even repeat what I said before out of context and say, look, he's doing it again.
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:25.181]  It's crazy.
[00:55:25.701 --> 00:55:26.602]  And it's gotta stop.
[00:55:26.822 --> 00:55:36.209]  Because if you're claiming I'm the devil for saying this stuff didn't happen and then opening wounds out of context years ago and then you keep doing it, it's bad.
[00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:38.370]  And it's outrageous.
[00:55:38.511 --> 00:55:40.132]  And stop doing it in my name.
[00:55:42.321 --> 00:55:45.005]  Regardless, folks, they're trying to shut us down, and you know that.
[00:55:45.285 --> 00:55:48.130]  And who knows how long InfoWars can hold on with stuff like this going on.
[00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:49.191]  I mean, this is just next level.
[00:55:50.112 --> 00:55:52.456]  But regardless, please pray for us and buy the products.
[00:55:52.776 --> 00:55:54.279]  Go get an InfoWars t-shirt.
[00:55:55.506 --> 00:55:56.226]  Please go get.

[00:55:59.028 --> 00:55:59.768]  It's similar to this one.
[00:56:00.609 --> 00:56:02.310]  We've got, we're all Alex Jones now.
[00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:04.431]  Don't censor me with a Gadsden flag.
[00:56:04.751 --> 00:56:05.372]  White on black.
[00:56:05.472 --> 00:56:06.152]  Really powerful.

[00:57:42.311 --> 00:57:44.812]  But the Globalists are going to throw some big curveballs.
[00:57:45.412 --> 00:57:46.152]  Some big ones.
[00:57:47.452 --> 00:57:48.253]  Isn't that obvious?
[00:57:48.293 --> 00:57:48.933]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:48.953 --> 00:57:49.313]  Stay with us.
[00:57:54.966 --> 00:57:55.946]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[00:57:56.146 --> 00:57:57.667]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[00:57:57.747 --> 00:57:58.087]  Hello.
[00:57:58.267 --> 00:58:03.149]  Alex, if I can just quickly, InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you for Polnblock.
[00:58:03.289 --> 00:58:04.009]  It's amazing.
[00:58:04.129 --> 00:58:12.712]  I've used so many different antihistamines over the years because I get really bad hay fever, and the antihistamines sometimes work, sometimes don't, but they never
[00:58:13.092 --> 00:58:14.393]  This is a known patent out of France.
[00:58:14.413 --> 00:58:22.136]  You have to pay for the patent, where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[00:58:22.156 --> 00:58:25.497]  How fast did it take for pollen block to kick in for you?
[00:58:42.765 --> 00:58:46.169]  It's pretty much straight away, you know, in maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:47.050]  It just works.
[00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:53.417]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms.
[00:58:53.537 --> 00:58:57.761]  And even then, they might not kick in for half an hour, or they might not kick in at all, depending on the day.
[00:58:57.801 --> 00:59:00.324]  Polonblock works every single time.
[00:59:00.404 --> 00:59:01.565]  Well, that's the great part about this.
[00:59:01.625 --> 00:59:04.947]  And for whatever reason, France discovered it like 50 years ago.
[00:59:04.967 --> 00:59:07.309]  It's still got to be even in this region of France.
[00:59:07.389 --> 00:59:08.369]  It's very complex.
[00:59:08.389 --> 00:59:09.210]  They don't even know why.
[00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:12.552]  But they think it's the pollen in the area, the dust, what the quail are eating.
[00:59:13.132 --> 00:59:19.797]  Then they just produce in the eggs whatever this essence is that just turns the histamine response off.
[00:59:19.937 --> 00:59:21.658]  I go out and I do market research.
[00:59:21.798 --> 00:59:24.220]  And I say, what are the best-selling products in the world?
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:25.761]  And what have the best reviews in the world?
[00:59:26.061 --> 00:59:34.205]  And then what do people in America not know that in Japan, or in Europe, or in Russia, or in Africa, or in Latin America, is already a bestseller?
[00:59:34.225 --> 00:59:35.866]  Because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason.
[00:59:35.966 --> 00:59:41.168]  And in Europe, and in Russia, and in Canada, there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs.
[00:59:41.709 --> 00:59:42.229]  It's not here.
[00:59:42.669 --> 00:59:46.091]  So we just made a souped-up version of it and discounted it, and it's Palm Block.
[00:59:46.171 --> 00:59:47.512]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139er.
[00:59:57.028 --> 01:00:01.170]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:19.901 --> 01:00:28.724]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.884 --> 01:00:33.265]  Alright folks, we've got the big exclusive Joe Rogan interview coming up.
[01:00:35.185 --> 01:00:36.666]  I've also got some commentary about Joe.
[01:00:36.726 --> 01:00:41.987]  I got really mad at him a few months ago, but then had some private talks with him and understand where he's coming from now.
[01:00:42.007 --> 01:00:47.069]  I have been completely poleaxed
[01:00:49.861 --> 01:01:02.184]  To hear that one of the Sandy Hook parents, who I'd never said his name, who's shooing me, and I guess gun manufacturers too, and a bunch of other people, committed suicide, they think.
[01:01:02.644 --> 01:01:03.304]  They're not sure.
[01:01:04.765 --> 01:01:06.465]  At the community, they said community hall.
[01:01:06.545 --> 01:01:11.086]  That sounded to me like the city hall, but it's like a community center.
[01:01:14.341 --> 01:01:24.265]  Then you turn the internet on, it doesn't matter what newspaper it is, Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman, Sandy Hook dad kills himself as defamation suit continues.
[01:01:25.585 --> 01:01:28.987]  So they haven't even read a note yet, they don't, it's just put my face up there.
[01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:31.227]  Immediately.
[01:01:32.908 --> 01:01:35.529]  The corporate media is just incredible.
[01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:38.690]  Just incredible.
[01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:40.191]  Well let me just say this right now.
[01:01:41.291 --> 01:01:42.712]  I will never commit suicide.
[01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:51.139]  And no matter what the corporate media does or how they spin tragic events against me, I'm never backing down, I'm never giving up.
[01:01:52.700 --> 01:02:05.614]  And since all this demonization and attack has gone on, on the streets of this country, 99% of the interaction I get is positive.
[01:02:09.972 --> 01:02:12.994]  The 1% is extremely negative and hateful and also lies.
[01:02:13.675 --> 01:02:15.556]  They'll start a fight with you and then say you did it to them.
[01:02:16.377 --> 01:02:17.677]  They're all a bunch of Jussie Smolletts.
[01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:18.798]  They act the same.
[01:02:18.878 --> 01:02:21.920]  It's a very deceptive culture that the left's involved in.
[01:02:24.142 --> 01:02:24.682]  That's what they do.
[01:02:24.722 --> 01:02:25.183]  They deceive.
[01:02:28.025 --> 01:02:30.286]  And that's their talent.
[01:02:32.408 --> 01:02:37.471]  But I just wonder how much more Twilight Zone this is going to get.
[01:02:38.252 --> 01:02:39.413]  Because it's not like I'm saying
[01:02:40.677 --> 01:02:45.722]  I'm walking in the hall and they go, did you hear about the Sandy Hook dad committing suicide?
[01:02:46.423 --> 01:02:47.905]  And I said, no.
[01:02:48.105 --> 01:02:51.809]  And I knew as they, as I walked in to look at the computer screen, it'd be my face.
[01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:55.533]  Now I thought I'd be like a paragraph down or something.
[01:02:55.593 --> 01:02:56.314]  No, no, no.
[01:02:57.015 --> 01:02:59.818]  I'm at the top of almost all the articles.
[01:03:01.299 --> 01:03:02.701]  Good Lord.
[01:03:06.238 --> 01:03:09.841]  You know, when some veteran kills themselves, do they show Obama because he sent him to Afghanistan?
[01:03:09.881 --> 01:03:12.302]  Or do they show Bush because he sent him to Iraq?
[01:03:12.382 --> 01:03:12.582]  No.
[01:03:14.564 --> 01:03:17.046]  You could actually show some cause, you know, those illegal wars.
[01:03:18.146 --> 01:03:19.487]  But with me, they just show me.
[01:03:22.529 --> 01:03:24.811]  Because that's all the media's got.
[01:03:29.636 --> 01:03:30.917]  And that's what they're going to push forever.
[01:03:31.738 --> 01:03:38.063]  I'm not going to talk about this anymore until there's new developments in it, but I'm sorry for his family and hopes and prayers go out to them.
[01:03:38.543 --> 01:03:39.263]  Jeremy Richman.
[01:03:40.905 --> 01:03:48.511]  But big public speaker, had a foundation raising money to deal with mentally ill people, which makes sense with the whole Adam Lanza situation.
[01:03:49.411 --> 01:03:50.892]  So sounds like a good guy.
[01:03:51.493 --> 01:03:52.574]  We said that's going on.
[01:03:52.594 --> 01:03:53.715]  I was actually looking forward
[01:03:54.636 --> 01:04:10.341]  You know, if things progressed, I wasn't looking forward to things progressing, but if they did, to actually look at those people in the eyes, and, you know, presenting the dozens of times I put out videos saying I believe your children died, and I'm sorry of the fact that we had to question official events, you know, it hurts your feelings.
[01:04:11.241 --> 01:04:22.025]  But, you know, I'm not saying that currently, and I never really said it the way you're saying I did, but I understand that was your lawyers told you that you would never knowingly know that
[01:04:24.048 --> 01:04:24.348]  I don't
[01:04:46.738 --> 01:04:51.922]  Those statements on tape with the dates and written letters to all the parents.
[01:04:52.683 --> 01:04:55.645]  So that people can't misrepresent what I've said and keep hurting them.
[01:04:56.045 --> 01:04:59.068]  It's really mean what the lawyers and the media are doing to these parents.
[01:04:59.088 --> 01:05:00.649]  These parents are really, really good people.
[01:05:01.209 --> 01:05:01.990]  Let's pray for them.
[01:05:04.062 --> 01:05:09.005]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[01:05:09.165 --> 01:05:12.046]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.

[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:24.191]  Tomorrow on Lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:35.313]  From the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:36.114 --> 01:06:37.435]  And we did reboot Americana.
[01:06:37.675 --> 01:06:43.920]  The audience, the Empore's crew, all of us, working together, all over the world, Americana spreading.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:54.989]  1776, the Renaissance, free market, rediscovering family, rediscovering men being men, women being women, rediscovering strength, competition, rugged individualism.
[01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:57.531]  It's now happening.
[01:06:58.311 --> 01:06:59.032]  And it's beautiful.
[01:06:59.672 --> 01:07:04.616]  And so those of us that are symbols of that awakening, we can't be seen as symbols of victory for others.
[01:07:05.797 --> 01:07:19.408]  We've got to be lied about and demonized and destroyed in the court of public opinion and then sued into oblivion so that nobody else ever dare stick their head up.
[01:07:19.848 --> 01:07:21.169]  But a funny thing happened.
[01:07:23.291 --> 01:07:27.474]  All that intimidation, all that censorship, all those lies have backfired.
[01:07:28.902 --> 01:07:31.064]  And now the globalists are going to escalate their attacks.
[01:07:32.865 --> 01:07:35.748]  Because they know that nothing they're doing is working.
[01:07:37.249 --> 01:07:40.252]  So we've entered the season of the Jesse Smollett event.
[01:07:42.974 --> 01:07:56.165]  And as I told you a month ago, there are federal investigations of Obama being involved with the head prosecutor that told police to back off Smollett.
[01:07:57.825 --> 01:08:00.206]  And connections to Obama running Smollett.
[01:08:00.686 --> 01:08:06.027]  And that was in the New York Post and the Chicago Tribune on Friday night.
[01:08:06.587 --> 01:08:07.567]  I missed it till Sunday.
[01:08:07.607 --> 01:08:08.067]  I saw it.
[01:08:08.567 --> 01:08:09.768]  Maybe you guys can type that in.
[01:08:10.268 --> 01:08:11.168]  Just into a search engine.
[01:08:11.188 --> 01:08:11.708]  Click News.
[01:08:11.748 --> 01:08:18.089]  The headline was, uh, Chicago police call for federal probe into Smollett.
[01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:19.490]  There it is.
[01:08:20.050 --> 01:08:25.111]  Cops call for federal probe related to Obama aide involvement in Jesse Smollett case.
[01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:36.697]  Type into your search engine, Feds probing accomplices who they believe helped Smollett.
[01:08:37.337 --> 01:08:43.822]  You'll get a couple articles and videos with me telling you our sources told us that that is indeed happening.
[01:08:44.302 --> 01:08:45.563]  And who did I say they were looking at?
[01:08:45.583 --> 01:08:48.745]  Who did I say they were looking at?
[01:08:51.325 --> 01:09:01.610]  The people directing the show, who stood to make tens of millions of dollars if the show didn't get unpopular, was starting to get unpopular, starting to lose momentum, a lot of momentum, lost half its ratings in the last two years.
[01:09:05.392 --> 01:09:07.593]  And Obama.
[01:09:08.133 --> 01:09:09.533]  Who did I say specifically?
[01:09:09.573 --> 01:09:10.994]  Because we have the sources.
[01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:13.275]  There you go.
[01:09:14.976 --> 01:09:18.678]  And again, you can go back to the article from weeks ago.
[01:09:19.764 --> 01:09:21.546]  In fact, it's in my yesterday stack.
[01:09:21.626 --> 01:09:22.306]  I never got to it.
[01:09:23.147 --> 01:09:26.110]  Pull that one for me, because I want to show the one from weeks ago.
[01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:29.233]  There's two of them from InfoWars.com.
[01:09:30.314 --> 01:09:42.525]  And the headline is, Feds probing accomplices, more accomplices of Jesse Smollett or others who may have helped Smollett.
[01:09:43.385 --> 01:09:44.646]  And then I list Obama's.
[01:09:45.868 --> 01:09:51.289]  And I say, high-level, people controlling the show, who have the motive to make tens of millions.
[01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:56.350]  So when you hear, it's not just cause of race war, that's part of it, but it really is about money.
[01:09:57.271 --> 01:10:00.191]  Smollett was gonna make a lot more money, not just a million whatever it was a year.
[01:10:01.192 --> 01:10:01.772]  Million one?
[01:10:02.592 --> 01:10:04.552]  If the show got higher ratings, he'd get more money.
[01:10:04.612 --> 01:10:06.453]  So, it's true, he was doing it for money.
[01:10:06.473 --> 01:10:11.614]  It was the cherry on top that created all this racial division.
[01:10:14.531 --> 01:10:20.016]  But I want to get more into Mueller probe because this was all an illegal thing kicked off by Hillary and Obama again.
[01:10:20.517 --> 01:10:21.357]  We told you that first.
[01:10:22.198 --> 01:10:25.721]  And now... And now it's out in the open.
[01:10:25.741 --> 01:10:26.442]  So what are they going to do?
[01:10:26.782 --> 01:10:27.703]  Here is a report.
[01:10:28.484 --> 01:10:30.506]  Mueller report reveals treasonous dims.
[01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:35.230]  There was no collusion with Russia.
[01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:36.972]  There was no obstruction.
[01:10:37.913 --> 01:10:39.094]  And none whatsoever.
[01:10:41.023 --> 01:10:45.327]  And it was a complete and total exoneration.
[01:10:46.949 --> 01:10:50.272]  It's a shame that our country had to go through this.
[01:10:51.838 --> 01:10:59.040]  To be honest, it's a shame that your president has had to go through this before I even got elected.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.280]  It began.
[01:11:01.361 --> 01:11:02.541]  And it began illegally.
[01:11:03.421 --> 01:11:05.842]  And hopefully somebody's gonna look at the other side.
[01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:19.206]  Once again, in this document that the Attorney General has just submitted to Congress, concluding after all of this investigation, nearly two-year investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller and his team, no collusion.
[01:11:20.046 --> 01:11:21.267]  Bottom line, no collusion.
[01:11:21.287 --> 01:11:42.904]  40 FBI agents, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 witnesses, 500 search warrants, 230 communications records, 50 wiretaps, 13 foreign government intelligence requests, and after 675 days, there is no collusion and insufficient evidence of obstruction.
[01:11:43.064 --> 01:11:46.487]  However, in broad daylight, the mainstream media
[01:11:46.667 --> 01:11:47.929]  We're at a turning point here.
[01:11:47.969 --> 01:11:50.592]  The beginning of the end for the Trump presidency.
[01:11:50.952 --> 01:11:51.953]  The beginning of the end.
[01:12:02.866 --> 01:12:03.647]  And breaking news!
[01:12:03.767 --> 01:12:05.068]  We have another bombshell!
[01:12:05.148 --> 01:12:08.090]  Mike Pence might have to assume the office of the presidency.
[01:12:08.151 --> 01:12:09.712]  The call for impeachment.
[01:12:09.772 --> 01:12:11.493]  Rumblings of the word impeachment.
[01:12:11.553 --> 01:12:12.434]  Breaking news!
[01:12:12.514 --> 01:12:14.055]  Another bombshell out of the White House.
[01:12:14.235 --> 01:12:15.436]  I believe this is the beginning of the end.
[01:12:15.737 --> 01:12:16.257]  I do too.
[01:12:16.357 --> 01:12:17.978]  It's really the beginning of the end.
[01:12:18.018 --> 01:12:19.019]  The beginning of the end.
[01:12:19.039 --> 01:12:20.240]  This is a tipping point.
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:21.121]  Trump's going down.
[01:12:21.241 --> 01:12:22.562]  This president could
[01:12:23.543 --> 01:12:26.325]  I do not think the president will serve out his term.
[01:12:26.465 --> 01:12:33.050]  This is treason and it was committed in living color across the television screens of America.
[01:12:33.251 --> 01:12:41.737]  Yet the Democrats and their deep state operatives within the mainstream media are going all in with their manufactured delusion.
[01:12:41.978 --> 01:12:48.643]  Simply because the special counsel could not connect the dots does not mean that the dots don't matter and the dots aren't troubling.
[01:12:48.803 --> 01:12:53.925]  He's been saying no collusion, no collusion, no collusion over and over again for a long time now.
[01:12:54.285 --> 01:12:59.947]  And he's going to try and conclude that this report is proving that there's no collusion.
[01:13:00.447 --> 01:13:06.569]  And you have a lot of his sycophants who will, you know, take the nod from him and they'll say the same thing.
[01:13:07.109 --> 01:13:09.930]  But we cannot allow them to get away with this.
[01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:11.911]  He does this all the time.
[01:13:12.351 --> 01:13:14.832]  This is not the end of anything.
[01:13:14.872 --> 01:13:17.333]  I think he's going to continue to say, look, I told you the truth.
[01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:18.253]  I said it was a hoax.
[01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:19.493]  I said there was no collusion.
[01:13:20.233 --> 01:13:23.354]  And the media and the Democrats essentially lied to you.
[01:13:23.414 --> 01:13:26.555]  That's going to be a core message, I think, for them moving forward.
[01:13:26.695 --> 01:13:28.556]  And it's going to be part of their campaign.
[01:13:28.896 --> 01:13:38.979]  Because you've had these Democrats, Adam Schiff and Blumenthal and all the rest of the ones that have been involved, you know, running from green room to green room saying, we have direct evidence of collusion.
[01:13:39.259 --> 01:13:40.319]  That was totally blown up.
[01:13:40.959 --> 01:13:44.103]  We're not exonerating the President after 22 months for the Attorney General
[01:13:56.159 --> 01:14:00.981]  Reviewing that record in 22 hours is a bit much.
[01:14:01.421 --> 01:14:07.143]  I would, in fact, wonder if the Attorney General pressured the special counsel into not making that finding.
[01:14:07.163 --> 01:14:17.307]  The determination was made without regard to and is not based on the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.
[01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:18.668]  That's very significant, Jeffrey.
[01:14:19.168 --> 01:14:19.628]  That is.
[01:14:19.989 --> 01:14:26.853]  But again, it's important to point out that that determination was not made by Mueller.
[01:14:27.233 --> 01:14:33.896]  It was made by the president's subordinates, the Attorney General Barr and Rod Rosenstein.
[01:14:34.257 --> 01:14:38.179]  Never a person that thought Bill Barr was somebody to be listened to and respected.
[01:14:38.559 --> 01:14:43.782]  Bill Barr was appointed by Donald Trump after he decided that Jeff Sessions wasn't his Roy Cohn.
[01:14:44.022 --> 01:14:45.143]  He wasn't his agent.
[01:14:45.543 --> 01:14:46.684]  The Deep State took a big swing and missed.
[01:14:46.704 --> 01:14:52.148]  The American people should respond with a haymaker of investigations of the Democratic Party, the media, the FBI, and the Clinton Foundation.
[01:15:12.142 --> 01:15:18.107]  Now that upwards of $40 million of a taxpayer distraction has imploded.
[01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:31.680]  I was told by really smart, high-level sources that as soon as the Mueller report came out, Trump will drop the hammer on censorship, which he's now doing against the universities and their anti-free speech activity and more is set to come.
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:36.984]  But make no mistake, it was Obama.
[01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:40.996]  It was Hillary and others that set up this fake criminal investigation.
[01:15:41.356 --> 01:15:42.096]  That's the crime.
[01:15:43.037 --> 01:15:50.862]  And now the Democrats, because they failed in their crime and could be brought to justice any time for being involved in it, are trying to double down.
[01:15:50.882 --> 01:15:51.803]  They are crazy.
[01:15:52.503 --> 01:15:53.624]  Oh, more hammers dropping!
[01:15:54.825 --> 01:15:57.466]  Michael Avenatti is charged with trying to extort Nike.
[01:15:57.766 --> 01:15:58.947]  Bloomberg, it just broke.
[01:15:59.067 --> 01:15:59.748]  More straight ahead.
[01:16:03.362 --> 01:16:12.208]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[01:16:13.028 --> 01:16:18.952]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[01:16:19.512 --> 01:16:20.533]  Then they set the precedent.
[01:16:21.013 --> 01:16:25.156]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[01:16:25.876 --> 01:16:27.297]  They take you off the internet.
[01:16:27.357 --> 01:16:37.261]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:48.745]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist, anti-human, transhumanist, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[01:16:48.965 --> 01:16:50.626]  And if we keep bowing to these cults,
[01:16:51.246 --> 01:16:57.260]  The cancer that is San Francisco and many of these big universities is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[01:16:57.721 --> 01:17:01.249]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks!
[01:17:05.307 --> 01:17:07.988]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:17:08.348 --> 01:17:14.230]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[01:17:14.771 --> 01:17:26.775]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[01:17:30.236 --> 01:17:33.978]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[01:17:35.805 --> 01:17:38.586]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply.
[01:17:38.967 --> 01:17:41.908]  This is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[01:17:43.849 --> 01:17:46.490]  Perfect for work in the car or at home.
[01:17:47.011 --> 01:17:49.792]  Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[01:17:50.252 --> 01:17:51.633]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[01:18:02.188 --> 01:18:08.097]  In a time where your body is constantly under attack by outside toxins, irregularity can be a nightmare.
[01:18:08.318 --> 01:18:14.487]  That's why InfoWars Life created Regulize Complete to relieve intestinal issues in a gentle way.
[01:18:14.828 --> 01:18:17.312]  Often a result of poor diet and lifestyle habits.
[01:18:17.532 --> 01:18:20.933]  An occasionally constipated colon can cause massive problems.
[01:18:21.234 --> 01:18:27.436]  Our researchers combined ancient ingredients traditionally used to combat these issues in an affordable way.
[01:18:27.716 --> 01:18:33.759]  Other harsh, stimulant laxatives can create massive discomfort in trying to solve intestinal issues.
[01:18:34.279 --> 01:18:41.283]  But Regulize Complete was made to be taken in a daily overnight colon cleanse to help you reach optimal gut and colon health.
[01:18:41.523 --> 01:18:48.407]  Our gentle, natural laxative, unlike other laxative products, our low dose is safe enough for year-round consumption.
[01:18:48.587 --> 01:18:52.969]  Don't let intestinal distress and occasional constipation get the jump on you.
[01:18:53.469 --> 01:19:00.893]  Start your colon cleansing for a healthier, happier gut today with Regulize Complete, available at infowarestore.com.
[01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:03.935]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:19:04.015 --> 01:19:04.355]  Go ahead.
[01:19:04.635 --> 01:19:06.836]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:19:06.856 --> 01:19:09.878]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:19:10.718 --> 01:19:11.839]  It just gets old, man.
[01:19:12.139 --> 01:19:13.880]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.641]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:19:16.901 --> 01:19:20.923]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:19:21.444 --> 01:19:23.384]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:19:24.205 --> 01:19:26.546]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:19:26.886 --> 01:19:28.027]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:19:28.247 --> 01:19:29.127]  Us being shut down?
[01:19:29.367 --> 01:19:30.388]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:19:30.848 --> 01:19:31.869]  You know what, Alex?
[01:19:31.909 --> 01:19:32.989]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[01:19:33.009 --> 01:19:33.830]  Hey, Frank!
[01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:39.473]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:19:39.773 --> 01:19:44.055]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:19:44.295 --> 01:19:47.157]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:19:47.437 --> 01:19:47.817]  You understand?
[01:19:47.897 --> 01:19:49.178]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:19:49.538 --> 01:19:50.699]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:56.622]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[01:19:57.503 --> 01:19:58.223]  Do you understand?
[01:19:58.243 --> 01:19:59.444]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:20:06.448 --> 01:20:10.550]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.252 --> 01:20:20.354]  From Nazareth he came with a ragtag band
[01:20:35.796 --> 01:20:40.138]  The devil's got a lot of tricks up his sleeve in that bag.
[01:20:41.519 --> 01:20:44.160]  God's got a couple tricks of his own.
[01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:49.123]  And things never seem to work out the way evil wants them to in the end.
[01:20:50.343 --> 01:20:56.727]  But you've got to be willing to put your butt, and your blood, and your guts, and your family, and your name on the line.
[01:20:57.707 --> 01:21:02.350]  You've got to be ready to be demonized, and attacked, and lied about by the globalists.
[01:21:03.396 --> 01:21:06.018]  That's the cost of standing against these people.
[01:21:07.339 --> 01:21:11.523]  Well, he was the big star, just like Malazzi Ford.
[01:21:12.944 --> 01:21:20.490]  Just like all these other people they've had come out and bear false witness and make up all these lies.
[01:21:22.752 --> 01:21:28.277]  Michael Avenatti is charged with trying to extort Nike, Bloomberg reports.
[01:21:29.343 --> 01:21:38.048]  California lawyer was charged by federal prosecutors in New York with attempting to extort millions of dollars out of Nike Inc.
[01:21:38.489 --> 01:21:43.412]  by threatening to release damning information about the company, which did not meet his demands.
[01:21:43.492 --> 01:21:45.693]  Bloomberg News reports.
[01:21:47.755 --> 01:21:48.535]  I'll have to call you right back.
[01:21:50.316 --> 01:21:51.717]  Got a lot of stuff going on here behind the scenes.
[01:21:51.737 --> 01:21:53.778]  Folks, I don't normally answer phones when I'm on air, but I had to.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:57.481]  Continuing here.
[01:21:58.857 --> 01:22:01.898]  The Dems don't know what to do now.
[01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:14.841]  They are in full panic mode as their house of cards begins to accelerate downward.
[01:22:16.942 --> 01:22:26.184]  But when we come back in the next segment, I want to get into the rest of the story and what undoubtedly Trump needs to do
[01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:30.152]  Now that the Russiagate hoax is behind him.
[01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:32.693]  Because truly, it was a cloud hanging over things.
[01:22:32.773 --> 01:22:33.694]  It was a distraction.
[01:22:34.214 --> 01:22:35.015]  It was a diversion.
[01:22:35.175 --> 01:22:53.467]  There's the head of the largest, most powerful country in the world, financially, being completely and totally destabilized by the lie that our president is some type of Russian agent that the people didn't really elect him.
[01:22:54.227 --> 01:22:56.089]  But if you go back to the front page of Drudge Report,
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:57.560]  There it is.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:22:58.940]  Trump wins.
[01:22:59.901 --> 01:23:00.721]  No collusion.
[01:23:01.361 --> 01:23:02.181]  No obstruction.
[01:23:02.881 --> 01:23:03.861]  No proof of crimes.
[01:23:04.421 --> 01:23:06.022]  But Nadler says it's not over.
[01:23:06.562 --> 01:23:08.482]  They never cared about what Mueller had to say.
[01:23:10.082 --> 01:23:11.262]  Maxine's had a meltdown.
[01:23:12.423 --> 01:23:13.883]  You go to InfoWars.com.
[01:23:16.303 --> 01:23:18.504]  We have the rest of the story.
[01:23:21.644 --> 01:23:25.125]  And that's what we already told everybody, but now that's been confirmed by major think tanks.
[01:23:26.027 --> 01:23:44.922]  And data collection groups and professors who've done the studies that Google openly stole the 2018 election and handed Democrats almost every victory they had by simply not even allowing people, in many cases, to know who was on the ballot.
[01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:49.145]  In many congressional districts, it would just show Democrats' names.
[01:23:49.806 --> 01:23:52.468]  Or it would say that Republicans' affiliation was the Nazi Party.
[01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:57.484]  They would not let you search certain names of certain candidates.
[01:23:57.504 --> 01:23:58.325]  They just wouldn't show up.
[01:23:58.345 --> 01:23:58.665]  Period.
[01:23:58.926 --> 01:24:01.848]  In fact, I've shot video this last week, never got it on air.
[01:24:01.888 --> 01:24:02.468]  I was too busy.
[01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:08.773]  And I did it again this morning at home on two phones and a desktop and here.
[01:24:08.793 --> 01:24:10.615]  I'm going to do it later this afternoon.
[01:24:10.635 --> 01:24:16.159]  I think when Will Johnson's on, I'm going to come back on during the last segment he's hosting in the fourth hour.
[01:24:16.199 --> 01:24:17.080]  I'm going to show you this.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:22.044]  But if you go to YouTube and you type in Alex Jones and
[01:24:23.365 --> 01:24:25.406]  You do the filter search for today.
[01:24:26.386 --> 01:24:29.488]  It shows a bunch of anti-Alex Jones stuff from a year ago.
[01:24:29.888 --> 01:24:31.669]  You click last hour, same thing.
[01:24:31.709 --> 01:24:35.891]  You click this last week, this last month, this last year.
[01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:37.211]  It's all the same.
[01:24:37.632 --> 01:24:44.495]  Now before people could get around the censors, they could go there and find new stuff being posted by searching last hour, last day.
[01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:50.558]  In fact, they're just showing you right now.
[01:24:50.598 --> 01:24:51.158]  You click today.
[01:24:51.178 --> 01:24:51.738]  Go ahead and click it.
[01:24:52.238 --> 01:24:53.999]  And it's showing you stuff from a year ago.
[01:24:54.399 --> 01:24:55.280]  All the hit pieces.
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:56.000]  Sandy Hook.
[01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:57.301]  Now click this week.
[01:25:01.143 --> 01:25:01.943]  And you click this week.
[01:25:03.003 --> 01:25:03.384]  Oh, look!
[01:25:03.804 --> 01:25:04.324]  This week.
[01:25:04.424 --> 01:25:05.245]  That's not this week.
[01:25:07.145 --> 01:25:08.166]  Then you click this month.
[01:25:11.568 --> 01:25:13.068]  I'll just go shoot it myself and air it later.
[01:25:13.088 --> 01:25:13.669]  That's what I thought.
[01:25:13.689 --> 01:25:14.289]  It's no big deal.
[01:25:14.809 --> 01:25:15.690]  Can't do it.
[01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:18.191]  Can we just go back to the filter, guys?
[01:25:18.973 --> 01:25:22.474]  Just please, please, please sugar on top.
[01:25:22.494 --> 01:25:22.734]  Okay.
[01:25:23.254 --> 01:25:23.394]  Yep.
[01:25:23.774 --> 01:25:24.514]  So let's just start over.
[01:25:24.554 --> 01:25:25.534]  Cause I need to get the clip.
[01:25:27.895 --> 01:25:28.915]  Click last hour, please.
[01:25:32.156 --> 01:25:32.376]  Okay.
[01:25:32.696 --> 01:25:33.196]  Same results.
[01:25:33.616 --> 01:25:34.637]  Now go back to the filter, please.
[01:25:36.677 --> 01:25:37.157]  Click today.
[01:25:40.578 --> 01:25:41.078]  Same results.
[01:25:41.538 --> 01:25:42.178]  Now go back, please.
[01:25:42.338 --> 01:25:42.918]  Click this week.
[01:25:45.139 --> 01:25:45.619]  Same results.
[01:25:47.881 --> 01:25:49.041]  Now click this month.
[01:25:51.082 --> 01:25:51.623]  Same results.
[01:25:53.203 --> 01:25:53.964]  Now click this year.
[01:25:57.965 --> 01:26:06.029]  Now, if you go to Beto O'Rourke, and you click last hour, it's the last hour.
[01:26:06.049 --> 01:26:09.490]  If you go to the last week, it's the last week.
[01:26:19.761 --> 01:26:21.162]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:21.543 --> 01:26:27.908]  There were probably a hundred videos every couple minutes being uploaded with me in them.
[01:26:29.729 --> 01:26:35.314]  And so Google has completely shadow banned in front of the entire universe my name.
[01:26:35.474 --> 01:26:36.495]  Oh, and the president.
[01:26:37.196 --> 01:26:39.077]  Oh, and Michael Savage.
[01:26:39.518 --> 01:26:41.719]  We went through last week for about an hour here.
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:42.880]  We shot video of it.
[01:26:43.821 --> 01:26:46.964]  Never got around to the report because Joe Rogan was in town and much stuff was happening.
[01:26:48.212 --> 01:26:51.373]  And we would search prominent Democrats, and their searches worked.
[01:26:52.393 --> 01:26:56.474]  And then we search prominent nationalists, conservatives, Christians, and you can't get them!
[01:26:59.315 --> 01:26:59.735]  Wow!
[01:27:00.475 --> 01:27:02.316]  So, Google doesn't fix any results.
[01:27:02.436 --> 01:27:03.196]  No, no, no.
[01:27:03.636 --> 01:27:10.678]  You just literally make it to where no one can search and find people's names.
[01:27:12.381 --> 01:27:18.205]  You know, used to you'd have like 20 videos of me and then one of the top TV host in England named Alex Jones.
[01:27:18.525 --> 01:27:20.006]  She's a lovely Welsh girl.
[01:27:20.026 --> 01:27:21.708]  I was on her show once.
[01:27:21.728 --> 01:27:24.169]  We made the joke that if we married, she wouldn't change her name.
[01:27:24.670 --> 01:27:27.652]  We both renamed Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Jones.
[01:27:28.312 --> 01:27:30.274]  She's Alexandra on Alex when we go by Alex.
[01:27:30.294 --> 01:27:31.955]  We don't have to change any names there.
[01:27:33.796 --> 01:27:36.178]  That poor dear, you can't find her anymore.
[01:27:36.898 --> 01:27:37.099]  She's...
[01:27:38.049 --> 01:27:38.469]  Bye bye!
[01:27:59.172 --> 01:28:03.354]  You can promote them on Reddit and Twitter and everywhere else, and then use it as a hosting platform.
[01:28:03.854 --> 01:28:09.757]  They haven't figured out a way to try to block that out yet, but they're sending everyone to the Phantom Zone.
[01:28:12.258 --> 01:28:13.118]  Oh, Beto O'Rourke!
[01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:15.519]  He's up to the hour!
[01:28:16.279 --> 01:28:18.961]  He's up to the day, up to the week, up to the month of the year.
[01:28:19.321 --> 01:28:20.581]  It's all an accurate search.
[01:28:21.262 --> 01:28:22.802]  But not Alex Jones, no.
[01:28:24.563 --> 01:28:26.324]  No, it'll be John Oliver forever.
[01:28:27.984 --> 01:28:29.465]  And it'll be Megyn Kelly forever.
[01:28:30.965 --> 01:28:32.566]  I guess when my grandkids try to search it.
[01:28:33.526 --> 01:28:34.527]  Who is our grandfather?
[01:28:34.587 --> 01:28:35.867]  Well, it's this is what he is.
[01:28:37.348 --> 01:28:38.348]  He's a bad person.
[01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:40.950]  It's an edited tape that Megyn Kelly put out.
[01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:41.670]  That's who he is.
[01:28:44.851 --> 01:28:45.672]  You know, I've made the point.
[01:28:45.812 --> 01:28:47.733]  Like, the media acts like I killed the Sandy Hook kids.
[01:28:48.793 --> 01:28:50.294]  And now this poor guy's committed suicide.
[01:28:50.334 --> 01:28:52.214]  The media already puts my face up next to him.
[01:28:52.455 --> 01:28:53.575]  No one even knows why it happened.
[01:28:53.795 --> 01:28:55.256]  And it's just, it's Alex Jones' fault.
[01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:57.973]  And I can't respond on any of their platforms.
[01:28:58.795 --> 01:29:00.418]  Because the corporate media are criminals.
[01:29:02.761 --> 01:29:05.344]  Democrats are pushing for full-term abortions.
[01:29:06.024 --> 01:29:07.345]  The infant would be delivered.
[01:29:08.026 --> 01:29:10.007]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[01:29:10.368 --> 01:29:15.032]  The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[01:29:15.332 --> 01:29:19.155]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mothers.
[01:29:19.495 --> 01:29:23.338]  And telling us that the future is too grim for us to think about raising a family.
[01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:28.443]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[01:29:29.203 --> 01:29:30.965]  Is it okay to still have children?
[01:29:31.744 --> 01:29:37.506]  I told you 24 years ago that the globalists have an anti-human, anti-child agenda.
[01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:40.827]  And back then, it was more secretive, only in their white papers.
[01:29:40.887 --> 01:29:42.007]  Now, it's all over the news.
[01:29:42.848 --> 01:29:52.591]  In fact, Alexandria Cortez, or AOC, doesn't just say you shouldn't have children, but that the world's going to end in 12 years.
[01:29:52.671 --> 01:29:59.293]  And, of course, the governor of Virginia, when he's not running around in blackface, well, he's saying they're going to kill babies after they're born.
[01:30:00.646 --> 01:30:05.907]  And Trump tried to get a bill passed to not kill babies after they're born, which is already the law.
[01:30:06.527 --> 01:30:09.888]  And the Democrats in the Senate shot it down.
[01:30:10.248 --> 01:30:14.569]  Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children.
[01:30:15.029 --> 01:30:22.371]  The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don't mind executing babies after birth.
[01:30:22.791 --> 01:30:24.032]  This is America.
[01:30:24.072 --> 01:30:24.772]  This is the world.
[01:30:25.692 --> 01:30:30.620]  2019.
[01:30:28.176 --> 01:30:30.620]  Brought to you by the technocrats, the eugenicists, the globalists.
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:33.864]  They call themselves fascists, liberals, communists, socialists.
[01:30:33.945 --> 01:30:34.445]  It's all the same.
[01:30:35.475 --> 01:30:36.435]  Watch my film in-game.
[01:30:36.536 --> 01:30:38.336]  It's free online until they delete it.
[01:30:38.356 --> 01:30:39.877]  I made it 11 years ago.
[01:30:40.297 --> 01:30:41.818]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:30:42.418 --> 01:30:59.007]  Now that said, if they can't abort a baby before it's born, or now kill it after it's born, and not fill them full of all these toxic vaccines tainted by design to brain damage them, if they can't fry us with electromagnetic cell phone radiation or GMO, or brainwash us with this toxic culture,
[01:30:59.926 --> 01:31:05.534]  They're going to hit us with people having major mineral and vitamin deficiencies.
[01:31:06.356 --> 01:31:13.246]  And the biggest deficiency in the mainline studies in America and around the world is pure iodine.
[01:31:14.067 --> 01:31:14.848]  In fact, going back in the 20s,
[01:31:16.141 --> 01:31:20.765]  The IQs were 15, 20, 25, 30 points lower.
[01:31:20.825 --> 01:31:24.748]  There was major deformity, major gout, major problems with the thyroid.
[01:31:25.089 --> 01:31:31.915]  And the federal government put a cruddy form of iodine in the salt and IQs went up on average 15 points.
[01:31:32.315 --> 01:31:33.696]  The deformities went way down.
[01:31:34.717 --> 01:31:37.539]  Our environment is lacking iodine.
[01:31:38.479 --> 01:31:43.404]  That's why coastal populations live longer on average, because they do get some seafood that has some iodine.
[01:31:43.424 --> 01:31:45.366]  But a lot of that seafood is contaminated.
[01:31:46.006 --> 01:31:51.752]  And of course, in the olden days, until just like a hundred years ago, people ground up bones and put it in their bread.
[01:31:51.952 --> 01:31:53.013]  Fee-fi-fo-fum.
[01:31:53.453 --> 01:31:54.975]  I smell the blood of an Englishman.
[01:31:55.295 --> 01:31:57.998]  Be they alive or be they dead, I'll grind their bones to make my bread.
[01:31:59.359 --> 01:32:03.243]  But the good news is, for your children, for adults, for everybody,
[01:32:04.116 --> 01:32:12.379]  We have the pure deep earth crystal iodine in original X2 that nobody else has and nobody else has brought to market.
[01:32:12.519 --> 01:32:17.900]  Now I brought out X3 because some scientists said you need all three types of iodine and some folks like it better.
[01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:22.022]  But I was able to secure with the original manufacturer
[01:32:22.742 --> 01:32:38.267]  A better deal by breaking my deal with them and playing guts ball where it's only been sold out for a couple months and we got the new deal done just about a month ago and they are manufacturing it now so people get on the waiting list.
[01:32:38.768 --> 01:32:47.531]  In about two weeks we'll be shipping X2 original all deep earth crystal pure atomic iodine directly to your door.
[01:32:48.431 --> 01:32:49.232]  Across the world.
[01:32:49.672 --> 01:32:50.493]  X2's back.
[01:32:50.833 --> 01:32:51.834]  It'll be here in two weeks.
[01:32:52.735 --> 01:32:55.937]  This is a blessing, so get yours at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:32:55.997 --> 01:32:57.098]  Again, thank you for your support.
[01:32:57.519 --> 01:33:00.141]  Support your own body with the purest, best iodine out there.
[01:33:00.521 --> 01:33:01.922]  X2 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:33:05.946 --> 01:33:08.608]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.038 --> 01:33:27.942]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.086 --> 01:33:36.170]  You know, the globalists really, really, really want to abort as many unborn humans and Americans as they can.
[01:33:36.190 --> 01:33:45.237]  And then they want to make sure that they get formula that doesn't have half the protein or fat that is needed so that your child has a tiny brain.
[01:33:45.917 --> 01:33:49.580]  Hell, they make the formula so low-level in Africa, kids die by the tens of thousands.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:50.881]  Same thing in Asia.
[01:33:52.482 --> 01:33:55.744]  And if that doesn't work, they want a bunch of tainted vaccines designed to cause brain damage.
[01:33:55.784 --> 01:33:56.805]  The inserts say so.
[01:33:59.070 --> 01:34:03.472]  And if they can't get that done, they'll try to teach their son to have their genitals cut off or be chemically castrated.
[01:34:04.392 --> 01:34:06.033]  They want to destroy civilization.
[01:34:08.374 --> 01:34:18.577]  But oh, do they care about the children when there's a shooting, even though it's one of the rarest forms of death for children who's been killed in a mass shooting.
[01:34:18.657 --> 01:34:19.298]  Still a tragedy.
[01:34:22.199 --> 01:34:22.839]  Ever thought about that?
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:27.661]  Democrats want to kill babies after they're born.
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:30.641]  It's no big deal to them.
[01:34:30.661 --> 01:34:38.166]  And now, if you pull back, they want to euthanize old people.
[01:34:41.188 --> 01:34:50.694]  But they sure care about your kids and want them to take those vaccines, even though almost all the new cases of measles, it turns out, are in areas where illegal aliens are being brought in with no vetting.
[01:34:51.174 --> 01:34:53.736]  The Democrats say, yeah, don't stop them, just let them in.
[01:34:53.996 --> 01:34:55.677]  Well, have you ever been to Ellis Island?
[01:34:55.717 --> 01:34:58.179]  They had quarantine for three to six months.
[01:34:59.434 --> 01:34:59.994]  For everybody.
[01:35:01.835 --> 01:35:05.556]  If you looked healthy at first shot, the doctor checked you out, you just had to stay there three months.
[01:35:06.676 --> 01:35:08.216]  You showed signs, six months.
[01:35:10.357 --> 01:35:12.597]  Six months in solitary confinement.
[01:35:12.837 --> 01:35:15.398]  You had a nice window looking out at the Bay or New York City.
[01:35:18.539 --> 01:35:18.819]  Oh, but
[01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:30.499]  All these famous people, medical doctors, famous Olympians, are saying they're getting death threats because they say, hey, vaccines have a lot of bad reactions and I got sick from vaccines.
[01:35:30.779 --> 01:35:31.879]  Oh, I hope your kids die!
[01:35:32.599 --> 01:35:33.420]  That's how the left is.
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:36.160]  But then when there's a mass shooting, why?
[01:35:38.601 --> 01:35:39.762]  We've all got to turn our guns in.
[01:35:39.782 --> 01:35:40.942]  They love the children so much.
[01:35:41.542 --> 01:35:44.603]  Sandy Hook victim's father dies in apparent suicide in Newtown.
[01:35:45.043 --> 01:35:45.823]  What a tragedy.
[01:35:46.684 --> 01:35:49.485]  He apparently committed suicide.
[01:35:49.505 --> 01:35:50.505]  They haven't confirmed that yet.
[01:35:52.076 --> 01:35:55.278]  The New York Times has a couple articles out, and what does the New York Times say?
[01:35:55.959 --> 01:36:00.301]  Mr. Jones has maintained that Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax.
[01:36:01.002 --> 01:36:02.003]  Has maintained.
[01:36:03.704 --> 01:36:13.710]  Maintained means continually, like you take care of your house, and let's say your foundation, or you take care of your teeth, or you maintain your physical health by trying to exercise and have a good diet.
[01:36:14.231 --> 01:36:14.731]  No, I've not.
[01:36:15.992 --> 01:36:17.473]  I've been all over the map for seven years.
[01:36:19.568 --> 01:36:20.809]  Been edited out of context.
[01:36:21.089 --> 01:36:22.530]  People have a right to question things, though.
[01:36:23.411 --> 01:36:25.072]  And I've told their lawyers face-to-face.
[01:36:25.492 --> 01:36:28.535]  And they've got the videos and the examples and the statements.
[01:36:28.655 --> 01:36:30.316]  And I went on Joe Rogan's show.
[01:36:30.336 --> 01:36:33.098]  It has 30-something million viewers when I went on.
[01:36:33.719 --> 01:36:35.000]  Second biggest podcast in history.
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.622]  And spent 20 minutes saying I believe it happened.
[01:36:39.903 --> 01:36:45.948]  But the New York Times sticks me in an article right after this poor man is found dead.
[01:36:47.315 --> 01:36:48.356]  And tries to include me in it.
[01:36:48.556 --> 01:36:49.596]  But hey, I ought to thank them.
[01:36:49.977 --> 01:36:53.839]  That's not very bad compared to all the other newspapers.
[01:36:55.380 --> 01:36:55.921]  Look at these!
[01:36:58.742 --> 01:37:00.463]  Alex Jones on the cover!
[01:37:01.044 --> 01:37:02.885]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman!
[01:37:04.366 --> 01:37:06.227]  A man's name I'd never said!
[01:37:06.247 --> 01:37:10.350]  That was a big problem, by the way, for the lawsuit.
[01:37:14.112 --> 01:37:14.873]  Never said his name!
[01:37:15.733 --> 01:37:16.754]  But now they're gonna say it.
[01:37:18.063 --> 01:37:18.964]  They're going to say it for me.
[01:37:21.385 --> 01:37:23.127]  That's Westport News.
[01:37:24.508 --> 01:37:25.268]  New Haven Register.
[01:37:25.508 --> 01:37:26.309]  Oh, Alex Jones.
[01:37:26.409 --> 01:37:27.450]  Alex Jones and Jeremy Richman.
[01:37:30.832 --> 01:37:31.713]  And it goes on and on.
[01:37:35.536 --> 01:37:35.976]  Amazing.
[01:37:36.056 --> 01:37:36.797]  Very, very sad.
[01:37:38.618 --> 01:37:39.919]  Very, very sad.
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:43.862]  I'm going to go to this very special report.
[01:37:46.775 --> 01:37:58.145]  That deals with New Zealand mosque attack and the way that you're not supposed to question it and how it's being used on a global scale to bring in censorship the world has never seen.
[01:37:58.225 --> 01:38:00.907]  Then the big exclusive Joe Rogan interview is coming up.
[01:38:01.367 --> 01:38:09.014]  Please don't forget we're lesser supported and we're willing to go through this hellstorm and you notice we're winning thanks to your prayers but we need your support.
[01:38:09.054 --> 01:38:13.337]  We have storewide free shipping 50 to 60 percent off but a bunch of these specials are about to end.
[01:38:13.878 --> 01:38:14.478]  Take advantage of them.
[01:38:14.498 --> 01:38:14.979]  Here's the report.
[01:38:18.363 --> 01:38:29.189]  In his so-called manifesto, the Christchurch shooter wrote that his motive was to create a conflict over gun rights that will ultimately result in a civil war.
[01:38:30.289 --> 01:38:36.893]  And not only is the New Zealand government eager to comply with the shooter's desire... I can tell you one thing right now.
[01:38:37.633 --> 01:38:39.554]  Our gun laws will change.
[01:38:40.295 --> 01:38:44.357]  But they made it illegal to possess the video that was streamed on Facebook.
[01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:49.863]  And the mainstream media is telling you to not read the manifesto.
[01:38:50.724 --> 01:38:56.287]  Tyranny has taken root down under, and asking questions is becoming a crime.
[01:38:57.208 --> 01:39:00.991]  Here is a list of suspicious activity that people are talking about.
[01:39:02.011 --> 01:39:13.519]  The suspect, Brenton Tarrant, had traveled to Israel, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia, Pakistan, and North Korea just years before the shooting.
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:21.543]  It was during this odyssey to Intelligentsia hotspots that friends say he changed.
[01:39:22.344 --> 01:39:30.087]  Within days of the attack, John Podesta was in New Zealand and described the country as a big juicy target.
[01:39:30.507 --> 01:39:33.329]  John Podesta said New Zealand's a big juicy target.
[01:39:34.810 --> 01:39:39.054]  In the video that Tarrant livestreamed on Facebook, there are anomalies.
[01:39:40.195 --> 01:39:43.317]  A barefoot victim suddenly has on blue socks.
[01:39:44.558 --> 01:39:49.523]  A loaded magazine seems to be waiting for the shooter on the floor inside the mosque.
[01:39:50.483 --> 01:39:53.526]  Shell casings seem to disappear into thin air.
[01:39:54.867 --> 01:40:02.554]  After firing hundreds of rounds in the main room, the walls remain untouched and the bodies unbloodied.
[01:40:04.055 --> 01:40:09.057]  During the shooting, there were at least two active drills scheduled in Christchurch.
[01:40:10.318 --> 01:40:21.205]  Ten miles west of the Masjid al-Nur Mosque, elite snipers from the NZSAS and other Asian countries were involved in a training exercise.
[01:40:22.505 --> 01:40:36.317]  And just three miles south, in an abandoned floor of Princess Margaret Hospital, the New Zealand Special Tactics Group, or STG, was practicing room-clearing and dealing with armed offenders.
[01:40:36.337 --> 01:40:46.665]  28-year-old Australian Bren Tarrant was charged with a single count of murder for killing an undisclosed person who is still alive.
[01:40:48.267 --> 01:40:55.112]  The police call it an administrative error and say they will update the charging documents to change the name.
[01:40:55.873 --> 01:40:57.234]  Three others were arrested.
[01:40:57.574 --> 01:41:02.538]  Three people have been arrested in relation to this event.
[01:41:03.119 --> 01:41:06.001]  Multiple vehicles were found with explosives.
[01:41:07.943 --> 01:41:18.059]  And at the same time on the North Island, suspected explosive devices were found in an Auckland train station and safely blown up by the Defence Force.
[01:41:20.779 --> 01:41:29.965]  The very same mosque that was attacked has been written about in local news for radicalizing two young locals who later joined ISIS.
[01:41:31.226 --> 01:41:33.668]  The original article has been deleted.
[01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:38.751]  And the government has doubled security to protect the Al Noor Mosque.
[01:41:40.052 --> 01:41:43.675]  A local Kiwi woman was arrested for an angry Facebook post.
[01:41:45.056 --> 01:41:48.678]  The Prime Minister encourages women to wear the hijab.
[01:41:50.079 --> 01:41:53.641]  And the entire nation observes the Islamic call to prayer.
[01:42:03.025 --> 01:42:07.167]  In Islam, they would call this a jihad, or a caliphate.
[01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:12.210]  And the government of New Zealand seems to be capitulating to it all.
[01:42:13.150 --> 01:42:17.852]  What a victory it will be for Islam to claim the city of Christ Church.
[01:42:19.353 --> 01:42:28.536]  Within days of the Christchurch shooting, a Muslim immigrant set fire to a school bus full of Italian school children to burn them alive in protest.
[01:42:29.276 --> 01:42:32.017]  And the mainstream media practically ignored it.
[01:42:32.738 --> 01:42:37.679]  Instead, they pine and beg for the same tyranny to destroy America.
[01:42:38.299 --> 01:42:39.580]  They want to keep you ignorant.
[01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:42.301]  Yeah, no wonder they don't want anybody investigating.
[01:42:42.321 --> 01:42:45.101]  It's up on InfoWars.com right now, the video.
[01:43:04.716 --> 01:43:12.121]  There's been a paradox or a contradiction on the surface that many have noted in the last hundred years.
[01:43:13.222 --> 01:43:20.066]  Historians are confused by the fact that powerful British and European and U.S.
[01:43:20.306 --> 01:43:29.893]  robber barons of the 19th and 20th century almost to a man funded socialism and communism.
[01:43:30.677 --> 01:43:31.878]  People say that doesn't make sense.
[01:43:32.639 --> 01:43:39.885]  But Carol Quigley, the head of Georgetown Political Science, Bill Clinton's mentor back in the 1960s, wrote Tragedy and Hope.
[01:43:41.586 --> 01:43:50.253]  And in the 1100 page blueprint, he explains that we want fascism, we want communism, we want socialism, we want command and control.
[01:43:50.954 --> 01:43:55.317]  But our favorite system is socialism because it domesticates the people.
[01:43:55.698 --> 01:43:57.739]  But we want to have the illusion of left and right.
[01:43:57.759 --> 01:43:59.281]  We want to control both parties.
[01:44:00.441 --> 01:44:05.610]  So the people think they're having change, but really they move in the same direction towards vertical integration.
[01:44:06.171 --> 01:44:12.060]  So you have the big billionaires, the people controlling trillion dollar companies like Tim Cook and Apple and others.
[01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:27.660]  Who literally run the equivalent of slave factories in China, who help round up political dissidents, but they're everywhere lecturing you about Black Lives Matter and about how Trump hates Muslims and how altruistic and loving they are.
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:32.583]  Because if you look into what they pay in taxes, it's almost zero.
[01:44:33.064 --> 01:44:40.469]  And it's all the big tech companies have set it up with offshore accounts and other systems where they legally pay almost no tax.
[01:44:41.573 --> 01:44:48.836]  And the very same people lecture you and I, how if you're making $100,000 a year, you're rich and you're not paying enough money.
[01:44:48.856 --> 01:44:51.237]  If you're making $200,000 a year, you're in the 1%.
[01:44:51.397 --> 01:44:53.998]  And you're guilty and you're bad.
[01:44:55.538 --> 01:44:59.520]  No, the globalists are in the .0000000042, depending on the analysis you do.
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:04.461]  That tiny percentage of a percentage controls over half the wealth.
[01:45:09.921 --> 01:45:12.162]  And they're maneuvering things towards a monopoly.
[01:45:12.202 --> 01:45:13.782]  They want to get rid of middle classes.
[01:45:13.822 --> 01:45:23.926]  They want to get rid of real free market systems that threaten them with innovation and new companies and new ideas and new leaders and new savants that come along.
[01:45:24.952 --> 01:45:32.434]  So they're creating a classical system, a two-tiered system, where the elite are on top, the people are on the bottom, and there's no middle class.
[01:45:33.014 --> 01:45:43.198]  That's the globalist aim, selling you on austerity, selling you on being poor, telling you your carbon footprint's evil, but AOC and the rest of them fly around on private jets and wear $3,000-plus outfits.
[01:45:44.978 --> 01:45:47.179]  All they tell us is capitalism is a failure.
[01:45:47.199 --> 01:45:48.960]  It isn't capitalism that's a failure.
[01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:59.466]  It's crony capitalism, using socialism and communism to control us, that is working beautifully for this world fascist system they've set up.
[01:45:59.986 --> 01:46:07.590]  It's corporate fascism using crony capitalism to dodge the taxes, to be above the law, diplomatic immunity, dominating humanity.
[01:46:08.130 --> 01:46:09.951]  And that's why they demonize info wars.
[01:46:10.451 --> 01:46:13.473]  If you read the Clinton Foundation documents, the Judicial Watch soon died.
[01:46:15.354 --> 01:46:21.840]  They're talking in the early 90s about we can't let right-wingers or nationalists ever create their own economy.
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:27.305]  If they sell a book, or have a magazine, or open a company, we've got to say it's evil and shut it down.
[01:46:28.916 --> 01:46:30.698]  We can't let them have a community.
[01:46:30.738 --> 01:46:32.120]  We can't let them create their own economy.
[01:46:32.421 --> 01:46:36.546]  That's why when you go to InfoWorksStore.com, you don't just get amazing products.
[01:46:37.167 --> 01:46:40.391]  You're funding the second American Revolution that's going worldwide.
[01:46:40.731 --> 01:46:43.295]  The very bane of the tyrants that you have a choice.
[01:46:43.935 --> 01:46:46.899]  We have store-wide 50% off right now, and we've got
[01:46:47.807 --> 01:46:49.928]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:15.295 --> 01:47:20.698]  I was going to air
[01:47:40.788 --> 01:47:48.112]  The hour and 15 minute Joe Rogan exclusive interview that I did last Friday in the next hour, and I still intend to do that.
[01:47:49.052 --> 01:47:50.473]  There's so many big developments here.
[01:47:51.153 --> 01:47:57.536]  I just went ahead and told them post the full video to InfoWars.com and to NewsWars.com.
[01:47:57.817 --> 01:47:58.637]  We can pull that up.
[01:47:58.677 --> 01:47:59.637]  I'll give people the title.
[01:48:00.498 --> 01:48:06.401]  But it's see Joe Rogan's newest podcast with Alex Jones in Austin, Texas.
[01:48:08.558 --> 01:48:14.142]  And it's very important that people see that interview, but I'm going to air some large excerpts of it in the next hour.
[01:48:15.043 --> 01:48:32.396]  Then Will Johnson's coming in, but the situation with Google censoring and how now computer scientists and top professors have looked at it and said, no, we can prove that they skewed votes to make Democrats win key congressional districts.
[01:48:34.292 --> 01:48:35.493]  That's election meddling.
[01:48:35.873 --> 01:48:38.894]  And that's Google using themselves as the supposed search engine to do it.
[01:48:38.934 --> 01:48:44.757]  But listen, it used to be an algorithm that whatever you liked the best, whatever you searched went to the top.
[01:48:45.037 --> 01:48:45.877]  So we were at the top.
[01:48:46.458 --> 01:48:47.418]  They broke the sucker.
[01:48:48.318 --> 01:48:49.799]  And you can't just halfway break it.
[01:48:49.879 --> 01:48:50.699]  Google's broke.
[01:48:53.201 --> 01:48:58.163]  And I showed this earlier if you're a TV viewer, but I want to do it when I'm standing up really professionally.
[01:49:00.018 --> 01:49:08.800]  And showing folks, but you can type in my name or other conservatives' names or other nationalists' names into YouTube, the biggest video site in the world.
[01:49:08.861 --> 01:49:10.301]  Over half the videos in the world are watched on it.
[01:49:10.821 --> 01:49:11.641]  I think it's like 70%.
[01:49:11.681 --> 01:49:12.261]  Look up that number.
[01:49:12.541 --> 01:49:14.622]  What percentage of online videos are watched on YouTube?
[01:49:15.842 --> 01:49:17.123]  It's like 70% last time I saw.
[01:49:19.243 --> 01:49:22.984]  And they will not let you search exact headlines of me.
[01:49:25.165 --> 01:49:26.085]  And then I went, let's check.
[01:49:28.137 --> 01:49:29.137]  Michael Savage, let's check.
[01:49:29.557 --> 01:49:30.578]  And it was everybody.
[01:49:31.218 --> 01:49:32.498]  But Beto O'Rourke!
[01:49:33.418 --> 01:49:34.218]  Or Kamala Harris!
[01:49:34.258 --> 01:49:35.298]  Why, it's up to the minute!
[01:49:37.579 --> 01:49:38.939]  That is so criminal!
[01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:45.000]  And then Sundar gets up there in front of Congress and says, we're not censoring anything.
[01:49:46.121 --> 01:49:49.581]  When their own internal memos show what they're doing.
[01:49:49.821 --> 01:49:51.082]  It's dangerous.
[01:49:52.582 --> 01:49:53.562]  It's out of control.
[01:49:56.363 --> 01:49:57.243]  It's crazy.
[01:50:02.344 --> 01:50:07.747]  So again, let's go to YouTube.com.
[01:50:07.887 --> 01:50:08.687]  All of you can do this.
[01:50:10.108 --> 01:50:17.092]  Go to YouTube.com and type into the search box, Alex Jones.
[01:50:18.993 --> 01:50:31.360]  And when you've typed Alex Jones on, you see the first filter without putting any filter on it is the list of Megyn Kelly, John Oliver, The Guardian, Vice,
[01:50:32.458 --> 01:50:33.118]  CNBC.
[01:50:33.318 --> 01:50:35.199]  Now, it's all hit pieces.
[01:50:36.379 --> 01:50:38.560]  Not because they were popular, because they've been force-fed.
[01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:43.161]  That happened about... Well, it happened last August.
[01:50:43.181 --> 01:50:47.302]  Right when I got the platform, they also rigged it where all the top search results were hate pieces.
[01:50:48.002 --> 01:50:54.544]  And at first they didn't have any views, but then they... Some of those have like 20 million views because everybody searching Alex Jones only gets those.
[01:50:56.735 --> 01:51:01.299]  But people kept going deeper, and deeper, and deeper, and deeper.
[01:51:01.579 --> 01:51:06.202]  And so, you could watch sometimes a hundred videos a minute being uploaded.
[01:51:06.242 --> 01:51:07.724]  I would go check it, like, I couldn't even.
[01:51:08.444 --> 01:51:13.088]  And some would have 10,000 views, and some a hundred views, but a day later, some would have like a million views.
[01:51:13.108 --> 01:51:13.868]  They would get deleted.
[01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:19.152]  But to get a million views in one day, what I actually said, people there trying to find it.
[01:51:20.594 --> 01:51:24.136]  So YouTube, starting on March 15th,
[01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:27.240]  with the Christchurch situation.
[01:51:30.303 --> 01:51:38.050]  They suddenly made it where no conservatives or no nationalists anywhere, it's not just me, can be searched.
[01:51:38.230 --> 01:51:41.252]  But Beto O'Rourke and the Democrats all still work.
[01:51:41.733 --> 01:51:44.755]  So by name, they don't let you search, period.
[01:51:44.996 --> 01:51:46.377]  They just give you what you want.
[01:51:46.597 --> 01:51:47.358]  That's called fraud.
[01:51:47.578 --> 01:51:49.439]  So click filter, please, for TV viewers.
[01:51:51.121 --> 01:51:52.282]  Okay, full screen, thank you.
[01:51:52.322 --> 01:51:53.383]  Now let's click last hour.
[01:51:57.025 --> 01:51:57.325]  Boom!
[01:51:57.865 --> 01:51:58.946]  Exact same results.
[01:51:59.006 --> 01:51:59.466]  Let's click.
[01:52:00.067 --> 01:52:04.769]  Now used to there be again hundreds and hundreds if not thousands in one hour of new videos.
[01:52:04.789 --> 01:52:05.570]  Let's click today.
[01:52:09.252 --> 01:52:11.573]  Same exact results for a hundred pages deep.
[01:52:11.813 --> 01:52:12.213]  Let's go.
[01:52:12.333 --> 01:52:13.094]  Let's click this week.
[01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:15.875]  This week.
[01:52:16.516 --> 01:52:16.956]  Boom!
[01:52:18.357 --> 01:52:19.137]  All the same results.
[01:52:19.637 --> 01:52:20.798]  Now let's click this year.
[01:52:25.424 --> 01:52:31.448]  Now you'll also notice almost all the videos, a hundred plus pages deep, as deep as I've gone, are all from a year ago.
[01:52:31.548 --> 01:52:36.971]  They just picked anti-stuff a year ago, and they just throw it up there, and that's what you get.
[01:52:37.552 --> 01:52:39.313]  So, you can go to the rest of Google.
[01:52:40.313 --> 01:52:41.114]  Google's the same.
[01:52:41.194 --> 01:52:41.794]  It owns YouTube.
[01:52:42.194 --> 01:52:42.735]  Same crap.
[01:52:44.298 --> 01:52:49.599]  You have to go to the URL InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:52:49.699 --> 01:52:52.320]  And yeah, we have our own commenting system.
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:54.140]  Doesn't work as good as Disqus did.
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:52:55.160]  They took that away from us.
[01:52:56.201 --> 01:52:57.661]  They took most of our bank accounts away.
[01:52:57.681 --> 01:52:58.741]  They took our PayPal away.
[01:52:59.041 --> 01:53:00.121]  They took our sponsors away.
[01:53:00.161 --> 01:53:01.682]  They took our ability to advertise away.
[01:53:01.942 --> 01:53:03.282]  They're taking it all away.
[01:53:05.563 --> 01:53:08.183]  As a beta test for you and everybody else.
[01:53:08.243 --> 01:53:08.723]  And guess what?
[01:53:08.803 --> 01:53:09.343]  Now it's here!
[01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:11.304]  It's here!
[01:53:13.371 --> 01:53:14.171]  Sean Hannity!
[01:53:16.392 --> 01:53:17.473]  Michael Savage!
[01:53:18.993 --> 01:53:20.154]  Tucker Carlson!
[01:53:21.354 --> 01:53:22.395]  Laura Ingraham!
[01:53:23.876 --> 01:53:24.716]  Lou Dobbs!
[01:53:26.557 --> 01:53:30.418]  They must have gotten in trouble for this because last week Trump was only sent videos.
[01:53:31.419 --> 01:53:34.400]  I checked it again yesterday and it was showing new videos.
[01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:36.001]  But let's see.
[01:53:36.221 --> 01:53:37.301]  Hell, let's test it live on air.
[01:53:37.321 --> 01:53:38.682]  Let's see if they're still blocking the President.
[01:53:39.445 --> 01:53:41.226]  Because they had the gall to do that.
[01:53:41.406 --> 01:53:43.768]  Let's go to Google, please.
[01:53:43.788 --> 01:53:49.131]  Hell, they banned his head of social media last week from posting.
[01:53:49.151 --> 01:53:49.411]  Remember?
[01:53:49.971 --> 01:53:50.572]  Facebook did.
[01:53:51.232 --> 01:53:56.655]  Let's go back to YouTube and let's type in Donald Trump or President Trump.
[01:54:00.617 --> 01:54:01.258]  And let's see.
[01:54:02.659 --> 01:54:03.179]  Let's click it.
[01:54:05.182 --> 01:54:06.683]  And that's one hour ago.
[01:54:06.723 --> 01:54:08.564]  So the filter is not doing it now.
[01:54:08.604 --> 01:54:09.604]  They are giving you the president.
[01:54:10.805 --> 01:54:13.186]  They weren't doing it as of yesterday.
[01:54:13.226 --> 01:54:13.946]  But oh, here's the thing.
[01:54:14.306 --> 01:54:19.889]  Google brags, and this professor is talking about in articles up on DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com, Breitbart.com.
[01:54:20.509 --> 01:54:25.972]  Google search bias flips seats for Democrats in midterms and stole the election.
[01:54:26.212 --> 01:54:26.672]  They meddled.
[01:54:27.252 --> 01:54:29.513]  And it says they studied how they did it.
[01:54:29.573 --> 01:54:32.295]  They didn't always not let you see the other candidate.
[01:54:33.308 --> 01:54:41.311]  They would shave it statistically for what needed to make you not see the opposition candidate, or the leading candidate, the Republican candidate.
[01:54:42.231 --> 01:54:50.414]  So only some of the time, in the algorithm, do they not let you see Trump.
[01:54:51.595 --> 01:54:54.296]  But somebody like me, it's 100%.
[01:54:54.336 --> 01:54:57.877]  Let's go ahead and play that professor.
[01:54:58.597 --> 01:55:00.418]  The article's been full up on Infowars.
[01:55:02.972 --> 01:55:08.238]  We're almost out of time, but let me go ahead and get to that piece from RT.
[01:55:08.278 --> 01:55:08.599]  Here it is.
[01:55:09.594 --> 01:55:20.105]  We had field agents focusing on three congressional races in California, which were very hotly contested races in Republican districts.
[01:55:20.846 --> 01:55:26.812]  And we gave to these field agents about 500 election-related search terms.
[01:55:27.713 --> 01:55:32.078]  Each one had different search terms for different districts, where there are different issues, of course.
[01:55:33.039 --> 01:55:33.199]  I think?
[01:55:52.638 --> 01:55:52.778]  I think?
[01:56:13.368 --> 01:56:15.090]  I've never claimed they re-rank anything.
[01:56:15.130 --> 01:56:31.488]  I'm just reporting on what they actually show people, and what they show people is dramatically biased enough in our 2018 elections to have shifted upwards of 78.2 million votes spread across different races in the U.S.
[01:56:31.528 --> 01:56:31.588]  in 2018.
[01:56:33.038 --> 01:56:36.321]  They call that b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-bombshell!
[01:56:36.561 --> 01:56:37.682]  B-b-b-bombshell!
[01:56:37.942 --> 01:56:39.623]  But that's just one way they do it!
[01:56:39.883 --> 01:56:42.766]  In California they listed all Republicans as Nazis!
[01:56:43.266 --> 01:56:44.347]  Political affiliation!
[01:56:44.627 --> 01:56:45.148]  Nazi!
[01:56:47.129 --> 01:56:56.577]  And that is Senior Research Psychologist, Dr. Robert Epstein of the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, which is basically DARPA.
[01:56:57.377 --> 01:56:58.979]  He said it was a deciding factor
[01:56:59.938 --> 01:57:04.124]  And, by the way, every race they looked at, the Democrats had stolen them.
[01:57:04.144 --> 01:57:07.629]  So Republicans had to have, like, a 30-point landslide to even win.
[01:57:09.251 --> 01:57:12.335]  And Trump's like, well, you just need to behave yourself and we'll still win.
[01:57:12.676 --> 01:57:14.579]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-Boulderdash!
[01:57:14.859 --> 01:57:16.742]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baloney!
[01:57:18.274 --> 01:57:19.335]  This is the real meddling.
[01:57:19.655 --> 01:57:20.176]  Get on it.
[01:57:20.236 --> 01:57:21.037]  Call the White House.
[01:57:21.477 --> 01:57:24.000]  We're going to post this segment of this live feed later.
[01:57:24.621 --> 01:57:30.387]  The total proof that Google stole the election and is currently rigging search results against conservatives.
[01:57:30.707 --> 01:57:32.369]  You just saw it if you're a TV viewer!
[01:57:32.729 --> 01:57:34.030]  Anybody can go do it for themselves!
[01:57:35.555 --> 01:57:36.496]  It's time.
[01:57:37.176 --> 01:57:40.118]  We're living in incredibly historic times.
[01:57:40.138 --> 01:57:41.798]  No one can deny it.
[01:57:41.818 --> 01:57:43.099]  World government's out in the open.
[01:57:43.119 --> 01:57:47.962]  They're creating animal-human hybrid clones, and it's in the back of the newspaper.
[01:58:05.333 --> 01:58:07.074]  There's open attacks on the family.
[01:58:07.715 --> 01:58:18.284]  A convicted child rapist are brought in with no background checks to teach three-year-old children in Houston public facilities how to engage in sexual activities.
[01:58:19.665 --> 01:58:23.509]  Ladies and gentlemen, humanity itself is under siege.
[01:58:24.570 --> 01:58:32.637]  It's being scientifically deployed to demoralize us, to dumb us down, to poison us, to confuse us.
[01:58:33.683 --> 01:58:35.885]  The bad news is it's highly organized and focused.
[01:58:36.366 --> 01:58:55.463]  The good news is it's so compartmentalized, there's only a few thousand globalists, corporate fascists, that actually are part of the program, that if we just awaken the general masses, and we awaken those right below the technocrats, many of the functionaries, we can blow their system politically out of the water.
[01:58:56.124 --> 01:58:58.166]  But right now they're pushing more than ever.
[01:58:59.130 --> 01:59:02.973]  To preemptively silence all speech that's not corporate.
[01:59:03.594 --> 01:59:05.656]  Just today, I randomly turned on CNN.
[01:59:06.036 --> 01:59:11.081]  Brian Stelter was talking about how evil free speech is and how we have to ban it for everybody but CNN.
[01:59:11.401 --> 01:59:13.102]  Then I got in the car and turned on NPR.
[01:59:13.443 --> 01:59:18.287]  They were attacking me, lying about Infowars, and saying that we need to be shut down and silenced.
[01:59:19.761 --> 01:59:26.923]  That's just today, when I randomly turned on the television to work out and got in my car to drive to the studio.
[01:59:27.443 --> 01:59:31.624]  That's because they're scared of you, they're scared of me, they're scared of this huge awakening.
[01:59:32.064 --> 01:59:42.206]  That's why now more than ever, when you spread the articles from newswars.com and infowars.com, when you spread those videos, when you tell your friends, your neighbors, your family about the Vermont broadcast,
[01:59:42.646 --> 01:59:47.628]  You literally break the back of the globalists, politically, metaphysically, and spiritually.
[01:59:47.868 --> 01:59:49.969]  So keep taking action, and I salute you.
[01:59:50.129 --> 01:59:51.369]  But don't let them silence you.
[01:59:54.631 --> 02:00:00.553]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.304 --> 02:00:34.410]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.092 --> 02:00:41.459]  You know, I'm not good at hyping things up.
[02:00:41.659 --> 02:00:42.200]  I just deliver.
[02:00:45.296 --> 02:00:53.644]  We've got the fact that we broke the Russian collusion as a smokescreen by Hillary and Obama to overturn the election and that that's really their Achilles heel of total crime.
[02:00:53.884 --> 02:00:54.745]  That's all confirmed now.
[02:00:56.006 --> 02:01:02.952]  We broke the fact that Google's fixing search results on a mass scale and I confronted the head of Google personally a few months ago.
[02:01:02.992 --> 02:01:03.933]  Now all that's coming out.
[02:01:04.414 --> 02:01:10.820]  You have top computer scientists that do work for DARPA that head up major institutes coming out proving
[02:01:11.704 --> 02:01:18.750]  That they stilted search results where you couldn't even see conservative candidates to 78 million voters.
[02:01:19.471 --> 02:01:21.893]  And stole the midterms decisively.
[02:01:23.975 --> 02:01:24.876]  Decisively.
[02:01:25.416 --> 02:01:26.457]  They're the new phone book.
[02:01:26.877 --> 02:01:31.161]  It'd be like saying you can't put a conservative candidate in a phone book.
[02:01:31.622 --> 02:01:32.562]  But it's beyond that.
[02:01:33.003 --> 02:01:35.285]  And it's all the other big tech working in concert.
[02:01:35.705 --> 02:01:36.226]  Here's an example.
[02:01:37.447 --> 02:01:38.568]  I go into Lucy's Fried Chicken
[02:01:39.974 --> 02:01:46.838]  This weekend, and people come over to where I'm sitting and three times tell me, eat crap, we're gonna get you, just horrible, vicious threats.
[02:01:47.539 --> 02:01:50.220]  I leave, they're waiting outside the door, cussing and screaming at me.
[02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:52.722]  I have to walk around them and say, well, screw you back.
[02:01:53.022 --> 02:01:55.984]  They edit the tape like I came over to them and did nothing.
[02:01:56.264 --> 02:01:58.625]  And then Reddit only allows the edited tape up.
[02:01:59.045 --> 02:02:00.306]  We put out the full tape.
[02:02:00.626 --> 02:02:04.449]  Reddit, as of this morning, will not let you post.
[02:02:05.409 --> 02:02:07.991]  Imagine the worship of the fraud.
[02:02:10.418 --> 02:02:12.339]  Now that's the moderators over the Austin subreddit.
[02:02:12.359 --> 02:02:19.024]  It's not as bad as the Donald, but I mean, this is like... Do you have to sue Reddit to make them stop that?
[02:02:19.064 --> 02:02:21.246]  Like, this is how the left operates.
[02:02:21.786 --> 02:02:28.912]  If we didn't have InfoWars, and God love them, they got a lot of problems, Fox News, you'd never know Jussie Smollett made that up.
[02:02:29.352 --> 02:02:30.092]  I first questioned it.
[02:02:31.574 --> 02:02:38.699]  If all we had was Reddit, and Google, and we had video that Jussie Smollett staged it, they wouldn't care!
[02:02:40.447 --> 02:02:41.228]  It doesn't matter!
[02:02:41.248 --> 02:02:42.508]  I have the video.
[02:02:42.768 --> 02:02:46.351]  I have the managers apologizing that they came over to my table to start a fight with me.
[02:02:48.032 --> 02:02:49.533]  And that I didn't respond three times.
[02:02:51.934 --> 02:02:56.937]  And then leaving, them flipping me off, cussing, saying they hope I die, eat sh-you-know-what.
[02:02:58.798 --> 02:03:00.660]  I'm like, well, I gotta go out this way anyways.
[02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:05.402]  I'm walking by him, and I'm walking by the guy saying it to me, and I'm like, get up then, man!
[02:03:05.442 --> 02:03:05.863]  Let's go!
[02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:08.770]  You're saying I'm gonna get it?
[02:03:09.411 --> 02:03:13.292]  You're about to, and he goes, security, he's at my table!
[02:03:15.713 --> 02:03:16.953]  These people are sick!
[02:03:19.374 --> 02:03:20.555]  But that's not what's sick!
[02:03:23.896 --> 02:03:33.980]  Saturday morning, my security, one of my security guys calls me and he goes, well, I guess you know it's the top of Reddit, what you did at Lucy's, or what happened at Lucy's, should have taken me with you.
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:34.660]  And I go, I know.
[02:03:36.516 --> 02:03:40.397]  I was going to eat dinner with Joe Rogan, and my wife didn't really like her dinner, so she wanted some oysters.
[02:03:40.917 --> 02:03:47.919]  So Joe went to his comedy club, and I went to Lucy's, and I had a bad feeling, and I'll take you next time, just so that, you know, if there's a witness.
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:50.540]  And I'm going to start having my security guy's body cams.
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:51.721]  Just like, all the time.
[02:03:51.741 --> 02:03:52.581]  Just have them on all the time.
[02:03:53.021 --> 02:03:53.641]  Let the cops have them.
[02:03:54.061 --> 02:03:55.022]  Hell, I might start wearing one.
[02:03:56.182 --> 02:03:59.443]  But see, it doesn't even matter.
[02:04:00.336 --> 02:04:02.396]  Because I go, well, I shot video of it just in case.
[02:04:02.436 --> 02:04:03.297]  I figured they'd post it.
[02:04:03.937 --> 02:04:07.278]  I go, I'll go into the office and post it, because I can't just upload to YouTube or anywhere.
[02:04:07.318 --> 02:04:07.718]  I'm banned.
[02:04:07.738 --> 02:04:08.918]  I have to do it my own platform.
[02:04:10.178 --> 02:04:11.438]  And so I come in a few hours early.
[02:04:11.478 --> 02:04:15.639]  I was already coming into the Sunday show, usually at about 1, to get ready for it at 4 o'clock.
[02:04:15.659 --> 02:04:16.580]  But I came in about noon.
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:18.320]  And we shot a live video.
[02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:19.280]  It's got a lot of cuss words.
[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:19.760]  We put it out.
[02:04:20.981 --> 02:04:26.362]  And so I asked my staff that have Reddit accounts, I said, say, here's the raw video of what really happened.
[02:04:27.549 --> 02:04:32.311]  Oh, the leftist Reddit said, no way we're gonna guard those people.
[02:04:34.712 --> 02:04:46.876]  And that's their whole system of this cowardice and ganging up and lying and rigging the system and just being confident in that unified fraud because their god has dominion over this planet.
[02:04:47.516 --> 02:04:52.458]  And every major tech site is just run by the scum of the filthy earth.
[02:04:53.998 --> 02:04:55.299]  Unbelievable!
[02:04:56.425 --> 02:05:01.388]  Alex Jones costs innocent babies.
[02:05:01.428 --> 02:05:02.589]  Why is he so crazy?
[02:05:03.370 --> 02:05:09.514]  And now, it's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[02:05:09.834 --> 02:05:11.915]  Alpha Power, at 50% off.
[02:05:12.456 --> 02:05:15.658]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.
[02:05:15.678 --> 02:05:24.404]  With the incredible ingredients in this formula, we can help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that lost energy and mood that comes with time and age.
[02:05:25.004 --> 02:05:33.230]  Alpha Power's incredible ingredients can help you boost your sports performance or enhance your day-to-day life with ease while encouraging hormonal balance.
[02:05:33.771 --> 02:05:38.815]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the true Alpha Male Pack.
[02:05:39.215 --> 02:05:45.900]  Alpha Power can help boost performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:49.703]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[02:05:50.123 --> 02:05:52.927]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[02:05:53.167 --> 02:05:56.993]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[02:05:57.273 --> 02:06:00.597]  Have 50% off only at the Info Wars store.
[02:06:08.288 --> 02:06:12.192]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:12.292 --> 02:06:20.239]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:29.567]  All right, the full Joe Rogan interview that he taped with us last Friday.
[02:06:30.902 --> 02:06:42.111]  He's gonna air right now and it really gets powerful where he calls out the internet censors and how dangerous it is and he gets into why he's mellowed out in a lot of ways and it's a powerful interview.
[02:06:43.112 --> 02:06:46.074]  The last interview I did with him is the second largest podcast in history.
[02:06:47.035 --> 02:06:49.597]  That's obviously on a platform where I'm not censored Joe Show.
[02:06:50.939 --> 02:07:00.642]  This, of course, is Alex Jones interviewing someone, and so the gods of control will try to block it, but they can't stop you from where we have it posted in our own format at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:00.962 --> 02:07:04.403]  We have it posted on some other places where you can spread it, and it's free to air.
[02:07:04.483 --> 02:07:05.383]  Anybody can post this.
[02:07:05.423 --> 02:07:06.283]  Anybody can use this.
[02:07:06.663 --> 02:07:18.627]  Anybody can do what you want with it, but I'm going to air a few segments of it because there's been so many big developments on the Mueller front and how the Democrats are responding that I'm going to be coming back later in the hour to get into this, but if you just joined us,
[02:07:20.054 --> 02:07:23.380]  Total proof by top computer scientists that Google stole the election.
[02:07:24.001 --> 02:07:29.672]  These are nonpartisan people, most of them actually Democrats, but they believe in real elections and that Google has too much power.
[02:07:30.854 --> 02:07:32.116]  And we also have
[02:07:33.345 --> 02:07:33.705]  Proven.
[02:07:33.725 --> 02:07:34.726]  We showed the video earlier.
[02:07:34.926 --> 02:07:35.687]  Anybody can do this.
[02:07:36.207 --> 02:07:40.731]  That conservatives are banned from searchability on YouTube.
[02:07:41.331 --> 02:07:41.892]  Just period.
[02:07:42.452 --> 02:07:46.536]  And so that video will be uploaded in the next 30 minutes to InfoWars.com.
[02:07:46.556 --> 02:07:49.318]  The proof that that all happened.
[02:07:49.898 --> 02:07:59.706]  Not just research shows they flipped major seats for Democrats in the midterms, but that they also are rigging search results where you can't even find conservatives.
[02:08:00.327 --> 02:08:02.789]  Searching for them is banned entirely.
[02:08:03.922 --> 02:08:09.464]  And then only negative comments and negative videos are hand-fed into it.
[02:08:10.364 --> 02:08:13.545]  It's unbelievable coordination and fraud.
[02:08:14.645 --> 02:08:16.766]  And then a lot of congressmen say, no, no, no, this is going on.
[02:08:17.466 --> 02:08:18.206]  So it's amazing.
[02:08:18.426 --> 02:08:21.687]  But here is large segments of the Joe Rogan interview.
[02:08:21.987 --> 02:08:22.387]  Stay with us.
[02:08:23.428 --> 02:08:31.810]  Well, this is going to be quite the commercial-free, raw, teleprompter-free, talking-point-free transmission.
[02:08:33.578 --> 02:08:40.183]  Joe Rogan undoubtedly has the largest program in the world, not just on TV, not just on radio, but on the internet.
[02:08:40.883 --> 02:08:46.787]  The largest regular podcast in the world dwarfing, in many weeks, what the NFL has viewing it.
[02:08:48.101 --> 02:08:55.746]  And I am the most banned person in the world who has routinely also had the largest radio or TV show on the planet.
[02:08:56.186 --> 02:09:02.170]  So this is quite a meeting of the minds, and I've known Joe since 1999 or so, known him good for about 17, 18 years.
[02:09:04.051 --> 02:09:08.414]  Uh, and I've never seen him so satisfied in a good way.
[02:09:08.695 --> 02:09:10.836]  Uh, so, so happy.
[02:09:11.617 --> 02:09:26.548]  Uh, so, so content, uh, because he was always driven world champion Taekwondo, even fighting up above his rank and winning that, uh, even in the heavyweight, a big UFC guy, a movie star, a bunch of big TV shows, news radio.
[02:09:26.568 --> 02:09:30.771]  I mean, going through all of the stuff you've done, but now you seem finally satisfied
[02:09:31.892 --> 02:09:37.456]  Because, Joe, you're now officially the world heavyweight champion of all media.
[02:09:37.776 --> 02:09:41.319]  Something Howard Stern said he did, but he never really did.
[02:09:41.779 --> 02:09:43.840]  So Howard Stern would tell us... No, I don't think it's Howard Stern.
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:44.220]  Good guy.
[02:09:44.541 --> 02:09:45.141]  Very nice fellow.
[02:09:45.481 --> 02:09:48.884]  The point is, he just calls me to be banned off the internet, even though it's supposed to be a free speech.
[02:09:48.904 --> 02:09:50.044]  But seriously, you...
[02:09:51.245 --> 02:09:58.992]  I think I've just gotten older and wiser and I've learned to smell the flowers and without getting too sad, I've also lost a bunch of friends.
[02:09:59.032 --> 02:09:59.392]  You know, I've had
[02:10:21.308 --> 02:10:22.954]  Three friends commit suicide this year.
[02:10:24.335 --> 02:10:26.996]  And you just realize what's important and what's not important.
[02:10:27.197 --> 02:10:34.820]  There's a lot of things we dwell on that are just nonsense and this life has a lot of beautiful things to it.
[02:10:35.101 --> 02:10:36.561]  There's a lot of it that's great.
[02:10:36.922 --> 02:10:53.430]  And I've chosen to spend more time thinking about the good things and thinking about the positive aspects of life and friends and friendship and things that I enjoy doing like stand-up and podcasts and the UFC and not being so tense about things.
[02:10:53.550 --> 02:10:55.033]  I've just, I've worked hard at it.
[02:10:55.093 --> 02:10:56.095]  I'm not always good at it.
[02:10:56.476 --> 02:11:02.829]  You know, I have my good days and my bad days like everybody else, but I just, you know, I just think I've gotten wiser.
[02:11:02.849 --> 02:11:03.891]  At least I've tried.
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.423]  So you're not satisfied because you're number one.
[02:11:09.483 --> 02:11:11.985]  You're saying you're just satisfied because you've gotten older and you figured out stuff.
[02:11:12.365 --> 02:11:14.647]  I don't think about the number one thing.
[02:11:15.548 --> 02:11:21.934]  I know the podcast does really well, but what I concentrate on is just trying to do the best show that I can and have fun.
[02:11:22.554 --> 02:11:25.697]  And the only way that I can do the best show that I can is to have fun with it.
[02:11:25.717 --> 02:11:27.518]  I mean, to be prepared, but also to have fun.
[02:11:27.919 --> 02:11:28.900]  So that's what I think about.
[02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:29.981]  I don't think about, like,
[02:11:31.223 --> 02:11:36.072]  You know, I don't think about dominating ratings or anything like that or continuing to do that.
[02:11:36.472 --> 02:11:37.394]  I support everybody coming out.
[02:11:37.414 --> 02:11:39.558]  You know, almost everybody else in media is totally obsessed with it.
[02:11:40.644 --> 02:11:41.285]  Obsessed with ratings?
[02:11:41.305 --> 02:11:42.205]  Obsessed with being number one.
[02:11:42.405 --> 02:11:46.207]  Yeah, that just seems to me like you either are or you aren't.
[02:11:46.227 --> 02:11:47.328]  And if you aren't, it doesn't matter.
[02:11:47.588 --> 02:11:49.369]  There's so many people in this world.
[02:11:49.569 --> 02:11:52.031]  There's hundreds of millions of people just in this country.
[02:11:52.711 --> 02:11:54.092]  You don't have to be number one.
[02:11:54.112 --> 02:11:57.674]  You just have to be something for somebody.
[02:11:57.734 --> 02:11:59.375]  You just have to be entertaining.
[02:11:59.395 --> 02:12:01.336]  I mean, we're in the entertainment business.
[02:12:01.376 --> 02:12:05.419]  You're more of an information distributor.
[02:12:06.879 --> 02:12:08.360]  Would you consider yourself a journalist?
[02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:09.281]  How do you consider yourself?
[02:12:09.861 --> 02:12:18.867]  I'm just somebody who's freaked out by what's going on, like human-animal hybrids and, you know, the Hadron Super Collider and all this crazy stuff that nobody even seems to care.
[02:12:19.227 --> 02:12:21.069]  So I get freaked out about that, so I'm just kind of a man.
[02:12:21.089 --> 02:12:22.549]  Have you ever talked to someone from CERN?
[02:12:23.690 --> 02:12:24.911]  I've tried to get CERN on the show.
[02:12:24.991 --> 02:12:30.915]  I did have the head of Harp on once, the civilian head, and then a colonel popped in during the break and said he said too much.
[02:12:30.955 --> 02:12:31.736]  Click, interview's over.
[02:12:31.756 --> 02:12:34.938]  He's like, well, we do set the atmosphere on fire at night, but not about me.
[02:12:35.799 --> 02:12:40.281]  Because I said I wanted to get you in here, and I wanted to do a calm interview.
[02:12:40.301 --> 02:12:42.803]  I just did the big motor-mouth intro and the rest of it.
[02:12:44.403 --> 02:12:47.385]  So we talked about the fact that you agree, though, you're the most satisfied with your life.
[02:12:47.867 --> 02:12:55.410]  Yeah, yeah, I think in some ways, but like when it comes to stand-up, right now I'm in the middle of putting together a new hour.
[02:12:55.610 --> 02:12:57.551]  I released my Netflix special in October.
[02:12:58.411 --> 02:13:08.995]  And so in that sense, this is like the least satisfied time for me because there's a period every two years I release a stand-up special on Netflix.
[02:13:10.071 --> 02:13:14.575]  And then for the next 10 to 11 months, it's chaos.
[02:13:15.036 --> 02:13:16.197]  And that's where I'm at right now.
[02:13:16.657 --> 02:13:25.105]  Constantly reworking material, rewriting it, performing almost every night except usually Monday and Tuesday, or Sunday and Monday.
[02:13:25.125 --> 02:13:28.268]  I'll take like two days off a week, but I'm doing three, four sets a night.
[02:13:28.628 --> 02:13:31.030]  Always writing, always reworking stuff.
[02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:33.593]  So in that sense, it's not satisfied at all.
[02:13:34.613 --> 02:13:38.356]  By the way, that's extremely Americana, say left or right.
[02:13:38.436 --> 02:13:51.585]  If I tried to quantify Joe Rogan, I would say Americana from Boston, an extreme work ethic, because I know people that know you a lot better than I do, and they say, man, Joe works like 15, 16 hours a day, and he's like really focused.
[02:13:53.891 --> 02:14:02.440]  That's something that we're really missing as a country, because I hear you talk about what these exercise experts you have on and all these amazing guests and that Delta Force guy you had on was really amazing.
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:08.546]  When I talk about people being fat slobs, I'm on some high horse, because I'm a fat slob myself, but I still exercise more than most people.
[02:14:09.186 --> 02:14:11.228]  I can't imagine where we're going to go
[02:14:11.889 --> 02:14:14.211]  As all the statistics show, people are getting softer.
[02:14:14.411 --> 02:14:14.592]  Yeah.
[02:14:14.612 --> 02:14:15.593]  They're getting stupider.
[02:14:16.173 --> 02:14:18.135]  And it's not like I'm looking, oh, these people are idiots.
[02:14:18.175 --> 02:14:18.675]  They're soft.
[02:14:18.755 --> 02:14:19.436]  I'm soft, too.
[02:14:19.796 --> 02:14:23.980]  But compared to most soft people, I'm on the high end, not the low end.
[02:14:24.020 --> 02:14:24.401]  It's scary.
[02:14:24.421 --> 02:14:27.203]  I have an article in the Daily Mail, a big archaeology study.
[02:14:28.024 --> 02:14:28.665]  We're good to go.
[02:14:50.242 --> 02:14:56.885]  Well, if you look at lower hominids, you know, if you look at chimps and orangutans, they're so much stronger than us.
[02:14:57.366 --> 02:15:03.169]  And we evolved from lower hominids, but our world does not require physical strength.
[02:15:03.349 --> 02:15:08.131]  Our world, it barely requires mental strength anymore.
[02:15:08.171 --> 02:15:09.852]  I mean, everything is kind of spelled out for you.
[02:15:11.957 --> 02:15:19.141]  There's certain jobs, of course, that will require you to use your brain, but a lot of them just require you to follow directions, you know?
[02:15:19.241 --> 02:15:29.066]  And I think as we become less and less physical, and as discipline, like physical discipline in particular, becomes less and less important, you're going to continue to see people being weaker and weaker.
[02:15:29.426 --> 02:15:33.849]  But there's real benefits as a person, as a human being, to exercising discipline.
[02:15:34.169 --> 02:15:39.011]  There's real benefits to hard work, you know, because you have a, there's peace of mind.
[02:15:39.231 --> 02:15:39.812]  Like one of the, like,
[02:15:40.592 --> 02:15:44.093]  There's one reason why I'm satisfied is because I do everything I'm supposed to do.
[02:15:44.393 --> 02:15:46.374]  Like in terms of the work that I'm supposed to do.
[02:15:46.674 --> 02:15:53.496]  I don't have any weird feeling that I'm not doing enough or I'm not doing the right amount of stuff or maybe I should be performing.
[02:15:53.536 --> 02:15:57.877]  Your genetic memory says I'm a man, I've got a family, I'm successful, I'm working out, I'm fighting.
[02:15:58.377 --> 02:15:59.337]  I'm a human.
[02:15:59.678 --> 02:15:59.938]  Yeah.
[02:16:02.838 --> 02:16:04.219]  I've got some really good news though.
[02:16:05.345 --> 02:16:06.006]  X2's back.
[02:16:06.726 --> 02:16:07.968]  The original X2.
[02:16:08.468 --> 02:16:09.369]  Deep Earth Crystal.
[02:16:09.429 --> 02:16:11.271]  Pure atomic iodine.
[02:16:11.391 --> 02:16:12.052]  What you want.
[02:16:12.492 --> 02:16:13.553]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:13.593 --> 02:16:14.554]  It'll be here in a week.
[02:16:15.034 --> 02:16:16.155]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[02:16:16.596 --> 02:16:17.537]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:17.557 --> 02:16:18.898]  With the best iodine in the world.
[02:16:19.358 --> 02:16:20.099]  X2, it's available.
[02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:21.460]  I thought X3's great.
[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:23.302]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source.
[02:16:23.703 --> 02:16:25.464]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[02:16:25.524 --> 02:16:26.425]  The scientists that do that.
[02:16:26.846 --> 02:16:28.667]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[02:16:29.508 --> 02:16:33.589]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[02:16:33.869 --> 02:16:37.389]  We now have X2 again at InfoWarsTore.com, so hallelujah!
[02:16:37.949 --> 02:16:49.631]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[02:16:49.651 --> 02:16:58.253]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,

[02:19:03.700 --> 02:19:05.040]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:06.901]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:19:07.001 --> 02:19:07.441]  It is.
[02:19:07.621 --> 02:19:12.022]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:19:12.503 --> 02:19:13.763]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:19:13.843 --> 02:19:15.584]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:19:15.664 --> 02:19:17.984]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[02:19:18.144 --> 02:19:19.705]  Brain, body, heart.
[02:19:19.785 --> 02:19:21.145]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[02:19:21.225 --> 02:19:22.446]  You've got the children's.
[02:19:22.606 --> 02:19:23.566]  You've got the adults.
[02:19:23.726 --> 02:19:24.626]  You've got the krill oil.
[02:19:24.726 --> 02:19:28.087]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[02:19:28.107 --> 02:19:30.468]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[02:19:30.708 --> 02:19:31.889]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:19:32.029 --> 02:19:32.710]  And I'm just sorry.
[02:19:32.810 --> 02:19:33.811]  You want something like this?
[02:19:33.892 --> 02:19:34.773]  You don't get stuff for free.
[02:19:34.873 --> 02:19:36.735]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[02:19:36.795 --> 02:19:37.315]  It's so good.
[02:19:37.395 --> 02:19:37.916]  In my view.
[02:19:38.016 --> 02:19:40.018]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[02:19:40.058 --> 02:19:44.684]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:19:46.446 --> 02:19:51.011]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:19:53.951 --> 02:19:59.755]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:19:59.975 --> 02:20:00.755]  I just can't do it!
[02:20:06.359 --> 02:20:09.061]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.326 --> 02:20:20.328]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:20.708 --> 02:20:22.029]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:25.495 --> 02:20:27.315]  You gotta know what kind of human you are.
[02:20:27.676 --> 02:20:32.817]  I don't think everybody should have to work out the way I do, but I think everybody like me has to work out the way I do.
[02:20:32.837 --> 02:20:34.537]  Because if you don't, you don't think straight.
[02:20:35.618 --> 02:20:41.319]  It's just... I was about to say, because I've never gotten super shaped like you, but I used to run six miles every other day.
[02:20:41.379 --> 02:20:42.819]  You were jacked when you were younger, man.
[02:20:42.839 --> 02:20:44.860]  I saw pictures of you when you were working out.
[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:48.421]  And then I kind of stopped doing it, and then once you get fat and really out of shape, it's hard to get back, but...
[02:20:49.301 --> 02:20:54.648]  When I like, like this morning, I hiked around a couple miles, went up a few big hills that are like, you know, three quarters of a mile.
[02:20:55.109 --> 02:20:58.413]  And the blood pumping through my brain, I was having the best thoughts ever.
[02:20:58.514 --> 02:20:58.774]  Yeah.
[02:20:58.934 --> 02:21:02.279]  Once, like the blood is energizing the brain, it's electrochemical.
[02:21:02.699 --> 02:21:04.822]  And I was just like, God, I wish my back wasn't hurting.
[02:21:05.142 --> 02:21:06.444]  I'd be packing for five hours.
[02:21:06.544 --> 02:21:06.684]  Yeah.
[02:21:07.425 --> 02:21:08.966]  Yeah, a lot of writers like to do that.
[02:21:09.006 --> 02:21:14.290]  They like to write in the morning, and then they go for a walk afterwards, go for a hike, and get the blood pumping.
[02:21:14.310 --> 02:21:17.452]  And then while they're hiking, then they think about the writing.
[02:21:17.572 --> 02:21:18.672]  They think about what they wrote.
[02:21:19.073 --> 02:21:19.433]  Exactly.
[02:21:19.453 --> 02:21:25.757]  Like, I'll be on the elliptical, and again, not that I'm in shape, but like about an hour, about 30 minutes in, I don't even watch TV or listen to music anymore.
[02:21:25.777 --> 02:21:28.419]  I'll just be doing this, and all of a sudden it's like, wow, whoa!
[02:21:28.999 --> 02:21:32.041]  And it's like, I can't capture that magic once I'm off there.
[02:21:32.301 --> 02:21:34.402]  Well there's a real benefit to doing it without music too.
[02:21:34.742 --> 02:21:40.345]  I like to listen to music and I like to listen to books on tape and podcasts and stuff sometimes when I want it.
[02:21:40.765 --> 02:21:42.566]  But I also like to not.
[02:21:42.746 --> 02:21:50.069]  I like to do it with nothing because I think that especially after like 15-20 minutes of constantly pushing, it's a meditative thing.
[02:21:50.109 --> 02:21:55.432]  You start getting into the breathing, you're concentrating on your breathing, and you're not thinking about anything.
[02:21:55.752 --> 02:21:59.514]  And then all the other problems that you may or might have, might not have,
[02:22:00.214 --> 02:22:04.655]  Whatever issues you might have in your life, they become less and less significant.
[02:22:04.915 --> 02:22:09.536]  They become more... You have a balanced perspective, based on physical exertion.
[02:22:09.576 --> 02:22:14.377]  Because when you're really exhausted, your body's really thinking it's trying to stay alive.
[02:22:14.797 --> 02:22:23.999]  You're running up a hill, and you're doing sprints, and you realize you've got 100 yards to go, and you're... You have no room in your head for bull****.
[02:22:24.079 --> 02:22:24.859]  There's no room.
[02:22:24.879 --> 02:22:27.800]  And that's what's crazy, is I'm hobbling up this hill, and...
[02:22:29.887 --> 02:22:34.810]  And like, 90% of them have these incredible understandings of my family life.
[02:22:34.850 --> 02:22:35.230]  Yeah.
[02:22:35.370 --> 02:22:37.932]  And the problem is once I get in the car and driving home, I can't remember it.
[02:22:38.132 --> 02:22:38.372]  Right.
[02:22:38.692 --> 02:22:40.753]  Well, I think that environment's unnatural.
[02:22:41.094 --> 02:22:46.757]  Us being in the car, us being at a desk, us being in studios with lights and all, that's the unnatural part.
[02:22:46.797 --> 02:22:48.798]  The natural part puts things into perspective.
[02:22:49.158 --> 02:22:53.060]  Physical exertion, breathing, it makes you understand what is important.
[02:22:53.421 --> 02:22:54.521]  Puts it all in perspective.
[02:22:54.581 --> 02:22:56.943]  Like, what do you really want out of this life?
[02:22:57.583 --> 02:23:00.244]  What is, what means something to you?
[02:23:00.705 --> 02:23:05.887]  And I think that human beings have a certain amount of physical requirements, just as a human.
[02:23:06.128 --> 02:23:14.132]  And if you don't meet those physical requirements, if you don't get some form of exercise in, I think it's very difficult to approach things balanced.
[02:23:14.472 --> 02:23:15.152]  It's very difficult.
[02:23:15.172 --> 02:23:18.714]  I don't think you're human, and believe me, I'm the worst about this, unless you're exercising.
[02:23:19.035 --> 02:23:22.156]  Because that locomotion, your blood, electrochemical, that's part of it.
[02:23:22.496 --> 02:23:23.177]  Shifting gears.
[02:23:24.454 --> 02:23:25.815]  You had a really big idea.
[02:23:25.835 --> 02:23:30.317]  We were talking a few weeks ago on the phone and then when I came out and did your podcast, which is the second biggest ever.
[02:23:30.337 --> 02:23:32.238]  I want to be number one and beat Elon Musk.
[02:23:32.458 --> 02:23:32.918]  Great guy.
[02:23:32.938 --> 02:23:34.099]  Hopefully I'll get there.
[02:23:35.106 --> 02:23:40.649]  But you're like trying to, we talked like an hour before we went on air for that four hour plus epic podcast.
[02:23:41.530 --> 02:23:42.790]  And I'm just hyped about the podcast.
[02:23:42.810 --> 02:23:50.114]  You're trying to really layer your bumps and really important points that when I sat back, I thought, wow, that's like the biggest issue there is of our time.
[02:23:50.134 --> 02:23:52.956]  And he's talking about something that nobody else is talking about.
[02:23:52.976 --> 02:23:54.077]  I mean, you really were doing that.
[02:23:54.097 --> 02:23:57.879]  And then I watched the big podcast with the head of Twitter.
[02:23:59.113 --> 02:24:08.257]  And his lawyer, they were obfuscating and dodging so much, in lawyer speak, they had a real chance to hit a home run, just be honest, that you never really got to your main point.
[02:24:08.417 --> 02:24:26.626]  I mean, people loved it, it was epic, it was great, but, well, you spent five minutes without me interrupting, which is hard, so I've got ADHD, to, and a few other things, to get into your big idea that after we had the podcast for four and a half hours, and I'm eating steak, you're trying to tell me, and I'm too busy, you know, drinking red wine,
[02:24:27.543 --> 02:24:35.208]  Because it really is the big debate of, you've got 90 plus percent of the internet on three or four platforms, as you said at dinner.
[02:24:35.608 --> 02:24:39.830]  A murderer gets ten years in prison, but Alex Jones is banned for life.
[02:24:40.571 --> 02:24:46.835]  Well, not just you, but people that say, learn to code, get banned forever.
[02:24:47.295 --> 02:24:49.796]  I mean, there's... So listen, you're going to have the floor.
[02:24:49.997 --> 02:24:50.217]  Please.
[02:24:50.677 --> 02:24:54.759]  But here's the thing, I don't want to get lost in Jack Dorsey or his lawyer or you being nice.
[02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:56.961]  So I want you to really go on your rant like you did at dinner.
[02:24:57.381 --> 02:24:58.782]  Because it was really smart stuff you were saying.
[02:24:58.802 --> 02:25:04.306]  I was like, wow, we should be having a discussion about pathways to people to get back on those platforms.
[02:25:04.326 --> 02:25:05.567]  It's not like we're kissing their ass.
[02:25:05.927 --> 02:25:06.928]  They're going to get sued.
[02:25:07.368 --> 02:25:08.990]  They're going to get attacked, which I don't want to happen.
[02:25:09.230 --> 02:25:16.115]  It's like Kennedy said, those that make peaceful discussions impossible make violent revolutions inevitable, to paraphrase.
[02:25:16.515 --> 02:25:21.639]  So I'm not threatening violence, but obviously I've got clips we're going to play of the head of YouTube.
[02:25:21.699 --> 02:25:22.600]  I'm sure she's a nice lady.
[02:25:23.516 --> 02:25:31.487]  Being attacked by this journalist she's on with saying my son likes Ben Shapiro so I want to ban him like Alex Jones and she's like well we're working on it.
[02:25:32.088 --> 02:25:37.975]  They don't even get that they're out in the open like they're God when it's people like you and everybody else that built YouTube.
[02:25:38.556 --> 02:25:38.696]  It's
[02:25:53.807 --> 02:26:00.969]  Left-leaning companies like Google and Facebook and Apple and these tech companies are all left.
[02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:08.671]  So I think a lot of people who are also on the left who disagree with people on the right, like Ben Shapiro, they want them to ban these people.
[02:26:08.992 --> 02:26:09.572]  Ban them!
[02:26:09.652 --> 02:26:10.072]  Get away!
[02:26:10.352 --> 02:26:10.772]  Take them away!
[02:26:11.032 --> 02:26:12.333]  That is not the answer.
[02:26:12.473 --> 02:26:13.633]  It's never been the answer.
[02:26:14.673 --> 02:26:22.215]  If you want to ban someone for doxxing people, if you want to ban someone for threatening people or harassing people, these are different things.
[02:26:22.255 --> 02:26:25.375]  You're talking about people that are doing something that could be considered a crime.
[02:26:25.755 --> 02:26:31.476]  But you've got people talking about banning people for having different opinions on things.
[02:26:31.897 --> 02:26:38.938]  You're talking about people who support certain religions, like Islam, because they don't want to appear Islamophobic.
[02:26:39.378 --> 02:26:45.322]  But they don't want to support Christian religions and Christian ideals with the same enthusiasm.
[02:26:45.462 --> 02:26:52.187]  Because they feel like they can s*** on those religions and it's, you know, we have an open season for them in this country.
[02:26:52.887 --> 02:26:59.792]  I think there's a real problem with people even not wanting to have discussions.
[02:27:00.653 --> 02:27:02.354]  You have to be able to talk to people.
[02:27:02.414 --> 02:27:02.854]  No, I agree.
[02:27:02.874 --> 02:27:04.656]  You have to be able to talk to people reasonably.
[02:27:04.676 --> 02:27:06.577]  Universities are supposed to be these bastions.
[02:27:06.597 --> 02:27:07.618]  So getting into that,
[02:27:08.683 --> 02:27:15.909]  Before we get into, as you're pointing this out, I can't believe she's openly saying she's working on banning Ben Shapiro.
[02:27:16.510 --> 02:27:27.579]  I mean, this is the same woman that said that the James Damore, the Google memo, that she was upset because it reinforced harmful gender stereotypes.
[02:27:28.140 --> 02:27:29.260]  It was science.
[02:27:29.401 --> 02:27:34.025]  Even Bloomberg, Michael Bloomberg came out and said, I'm not running as a Democrat.
[02:27:35.051 --> 02:27:37.632]  Because they're all saying whites are inherently evil.
[02:27:38.052 --> 02:27:43.473]  Martin Luther King said, you don't judge somebody off what color they are, you judge them off what they produce.
[02:27:43.653 --> 02:27:46.994]  Yeah, I don't think most Democrats are saying whites are inherently evil.
[02:27:47.014 --> 02:27:55.376]  The problem is, the fringe, the far left, are so loud and vocal with some of their rhetoric that everyone gets lumped into them.
[02:27:55.396 --> 02:27:55.796]  I agree with you.
[02:27:55.816 --> 02:27:57.076]  People who are reasonable left.
[02:27:57.156 --> 02:27:59.617]  But if I tune into CNN or MSNBC, that's what I see, Joe.
[02:28:00.222 --> 02:28:02.844]  You see some of that because they think it's acceptable.
[02:28:02.864 --> 02:28:04.165]  I mean, that's part of what it is.
[02:28:04.185 --> 02:28:04.825]  But who wants to?
[02:28:04.845 --> 02:28:05.866]  I don't want to hate people.
[02:28:05.906 --> 02:28:06.687]  I don't want to either.
[02:28:06.727 --> 02:28:09.009]  I think there's a lot of sheep think going on.
[02:28:09.069 --> 02:28:10.730]  People are seeing the tide.
[02:28:10.990 --> 02:28:15.213]  They're licking their finger, they're putting it up in the air, they're finding out which way the wind's blowing, and then they're going that way.
[02:28:15.433 --> 02:28:17.795]  Because it's very difficult to formulate opinions on your own.
[02:28:18.115 --> 02:28:24.340]  It's much easier to just adopt a predetermined pattern of thinking that other people have already laid out in front of you.
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:24.880]  They just repeat it.
[02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:25.601]  So let me ask you a question.
[02:28:26.181 --> 02:28:27.101]  And that's a feedback loop?
[02:28:41.926 --> 02:28:43.427]  In James Damore's case, he was fired.
[02:28:43.707 --> 02:28:48.250]  He's a very nice guy, and a very reasonable guy, and he's not sexist by any stretch of the imagination.
[02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:51.892]  And these things have been labeled- He's just not gonna be the villain because he's a male.
[02:28:52.212 --> 02:28:54.473]  So, so, so- Well, it's- he's- he's a scientist.
[02:28:54.533 --> 02:28:57.035]  I mean, this is really what the guy- he's an engineer.
[02:28:57.075 --> 02:29:01.177]  He's a- he's a guy who went into the science and wrote a paper about-
[02:29:02.116 --> 02:29:02.617]  No someone.
[02:29:18.839 --> 02:29:20.220]  50% off all the supplements.

[02:30:04.685 --> 02:30:12.211]  Dare I say, we're about to be joined by the Rembrandt, the Da Vinci of meme-making, Carpe Danktum.
[02:30:12.431 --> 02:30:19.576]  But let's look at the meme that Carpe Danktum made that President Trump shared that was then censored on Twitter.
[02:30:20.457 --> 02:30:22.418]  Madam Speaker!
[02:30:22.538 --> 02:30:25.160]  The President of the United States!
[02:30:33.989 --> 02:30:37.493]  Thank you very much.
[02:30:56.514 --> 02:31:09.205]  Madam Speaker, members of Congress, the state of our union is strong.
[02:31:11.987 --> 02:31:20.474]  Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.
[02:31:32.543 --> 02:31:40.126]  So, Carpe Doctum joins me now, and I gotta be honest with you folks, I feel like right now I'm interviewing one of the greatest artists of all time.
[02:31:40.206 --> 02:31:43.667]  So, Carpe Doctum, thank you for joining me today on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:43.807 --> 02:31:45.228]  So, let's talk about the name.
[02:31:45.548 --> 02:31:52.991]  Obviously, Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, the famous saying, and then you have Carpe Noctum, which is Seize the Night.
[02:31:53.191 --> 02:31:55.672]  So, Carpe Doctum, is that Seize the Donk?
[02:31:55.852 --> 02:31:57.212]  It's Seize the Donkey.
[02:31:57.472 --> 02:31:58.633]  Seize the Donkey.
[02:31:58.653 --> 02:31:59.433]  Seize that Democrat.
[02:32:02.415 --> 02:32:03.356]  Ah, okay, okay.
[02:32:03.377 --> 02:32:05.841]  Because I was wondering, I knew that there had to be something to that name.
[02:32:06.041 --> 02:32:07.924]  So Carpe Doctum is seize the Democrats.
[02:32:07.944 --> 02:32:11.971]  So that's basically, seize the opportunity that the left provides you to create beautiful memes.
[02:32:12.211 --> 02:32:14.435]  That is my interpretation of my fake Latin, yes.
[02:32:15.700 --> 02:32:18.662]  Well, I have to say, you've done a lot of great work, obviously.
[02:32:18.702 --> 02:32:20.022]  Your creativity shines through.
[02:32:20.162 --> 02:32:23.104]  If you don't want to get into this, I understand, but I need an answer here.
[02:32:23.244 --> 02:32:30.448]  Can you confirm or deny that you were the character featured in Make Love Not Warcraft in South Park?
[02:32:31.088 --> 02:32:34.070]  Now, we've got the clip, and there have been some theories, okay?
[02:32:34.090 --> 02:32:41.554]  There have been some theories branded about here that this character from South Park, Make Love Not Warcraft, is actually based on you.
[02:32:41.594 --> 02:32:44.756]  Now, can you confirm or deny these claims right now?
[02:32:45.356 --> 02:32:47.478]  I can't confirm or deny right now.
[02:32:48.638 --> 02:32:51.480]  Can Carpe Donctum, can you confirm or deny?
[02:32:52.721 --> 02:32:56.604]  I can't confirm or deny, I just know that Infowars is the sword of a thousand truths.
[02:32:57.505 --> 02:32:59.946]  He's meme legend at Carpe Donctum on Twitter.
[02:32:59.966 --> 02:33:00.567]  Follow him now.
[02:33:06.291 --> 02:33:08.892]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:15.103 --> 02:33:16.724]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:17.044 --> 02:33:23.069]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:23.129 --> 02:33:39.561]  And we are back live.
[02:33:39.641 --> 02:33:43.224]  I just aired 20 minutes of a powerful Joe Rogan interview.
[02:33:45.117 --> 02:33:47.438]  The full interview is up on Infowars.com.
[02:33:48.219 --> 02:33:52.621]  We've got so much big breaking news that I'm going to air the rest of it for radio and TV viewers tomorrow.
[02:33:52.641 --> 02:33:59.005]  But if you're on the internet and want to get around the censors and really make them upset, go to Infowars.com and there it is posted.
[02:33:59.645 --> 02:34:02.047]  Joe Rogan does a new podcast with Alex Jones.
[02:34:02.127 --> 02:34:05.509]  See Joe Rogan's new podcast with Alex Jones in Austin, Texas.
[02:34:07.050 --> 02:34:10.432]  And Joe's really popular across the political spectrum.
[02:34:11.638 --> 02:34:20.744]  And I got really mad at Joe because he knows about the censorship, knew it was going on, had been anti-censorship before, but really wasn't standing up for myself and others.
[02:34:20.764 --> 02:34:23.666]  So I got really vicious about the whole thing.
[02:34:24.467 --> 02:34:34.113]  And then I saw Joe really turn the corner and I'm just proud of what he did.
[02:34:34.133 --> 02:34:39.257]  In fact, let's air a few more minutes of Joe.
[02:34:40.799 --> 02:34:42.760]  Then I'm going to come back and get into this big breaking news.
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:43.221]  Here it is.
[02:34:44.141 --> 02:34:45.862]  But the guy, he's an engineer.
[02:34:45.902 --> 02:34:56.229]  He's a guy who went into the science and wrote a paper about the science of the differences in general of men and women when it comes to what they're interested in doing.
[02:34:56.729 --> 02:35:02.433]  And even wrote a page and a half about strategies to encourage women to get into tech.
[02:35:02.713 --> 02:35:06.636]  Like, he's not reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes.
[02:35:07.056 --> 02:35:07.656]  He's talking about science.
[02:35:07.696 --> 02:35:15.899]  Having women get in a cult controlled by weird feminist leaders like the head of YouTube actually pigeonholes them and then makes them not integrate into society.
[02:35:15.939 --> 02:35:16.599]  It's totally sick.
[02:35:16.879 --> 02:35:19.980]  And they're doing this in the West that's in power women more than any other.
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.121]  But even in her situation...
[02:35:22.501 --> 02:35:26.104]  I think she is probably a product of the very environment that she works in.
[02:35:26.425 --> 02:35:29.727]  Look, she's running this thing, and it's a gigantic left-wing thing.
[02:35:30.048 --> 02:35:35.553]  This think tank, this mindset that permeates the entire establishment, she's a part of it.
[02:35:35.613 --> 02:35:36.013]  No, you're right.
[02:35:36.073 --> 02:35:38.615]  And she gets sucked into it as much as anybody does.
[02:35:38.675 --> 02:35:42.659]  It's like when you had Jack Dorsey on, he goes, well, we have laboratories that are testing all this.
[02:35:42.839 --> 02:35:49.045]  So if you go back to that steak dinner by your office that we had three weeks ago, because in like six, seven minutes, you laid it all out about,
[02:35:49.665 --> 02:35:57.051]  You know, we need to create a real debate and say to them, look, you don't, murderers don't get banned from something for life unless it's premeditated.
[02:35:57.071 --> 02:35:58.392]  You can't do this to people.
[02:35:58.732 --> 02:36:01.794]  This is going to cause a societal crisis, which I don't want to have.
[02:36:01.814 --> 02:36:03.315]  I'm not even begging to get back on their platforms.
[02:36:03.375 --> 02:36:04.336]  I have my platforms.
[02:36:04.736 --> 02:36:07.418]  It's just that I can see that it's super dangerous.
[02:36:07.438 --> 02:36:11.221]  And now they're banning people's books and now they're, you know, now Amazon's doing it.
[02:36:11.261 --> 02:36:15.805]  So can you, in your own words, because it was really powerful, that big idea about a
[02:36:16.305 --> 02:36:23.887]  A road, not even so much to redemption, but a road for big tech to admit it's been out of control and a way to bring people back on.
[02:36:24.647 --> 02:36:39.330]  There has to be a place that is like Twitter, that is the number one environment for global communication, where both people on the right and the left can feel free to express their ideologies.
[02:36:39.730 --> 02:36:43.752]  Feel free, and have a place where they can debate back and forth.
[02:36:44.133 --> 02:37:01.142]  As soon as one side controls the narrative, as soon as you have the people on the left that are silencing the people on the right, and you know, this is one of the things that came up during the podcast with Vijja and Jack Dorsey, where Tim Poole was saying that by saying, deadnaming someone, or misgendering someone, you can get banned for life.
[02:37:01.423 --> 02:37:07.226]  Like, you're saying to a person, perhaps maybe that someone has very distinct religious beliefs.
[02:37:07.586 --> 02:37:12.470]  Where they don't believe that someone is capable of transitioning from a man to a woman.
[02:37:12.590 --> 02:37:14.092]  And there's no judge, there's no jury.
[02:37:14.392 --> 02:37:15.333]  You never get arrested.
[02:37:15.393 --> 02:37:16.113]  You're just banned.
[02:37:16.133 --> 02:37:17.114]  You're just banned.
[02:37:17.134 --> 02:37:19.096]  And it's based on their ideology.
[02:37:19.236 --> 02:37:24.501]  It's not based on rules that our society agrees upon.
[02:37:24.521 --> 02:37:27.063]  Because the rules of free speech, they're pretty clear.
[02:37:27.363 --> 02:37:30.646]  Like, in the rules of free speech, you could call someone whatever you want.
[02:37:30.906 --> 02:37:31.827]  Like, that's free speech.
[02:37:32.207 --> 02:37:33.008]  As long as you're not
[02:37:33.388 --> 02:37:35.409]  Alright, so the interview gets better and better.
[02:37:35.829 --> 02:37:39.491]  The full interview is posted to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:37:40.191 --> 02:37:42.873]  Now, a lot of people say, okay, yeah, Joe's saying free speech exists.
[02:37:42.893 --> 02:37:43.533]  That's a good thing.
[02:37:44.594 --> 02:37:55.479]  But he's doing it on a platform where he's very popular with leftists and liberals, not just conservatives and hunters and fitness enthusiasts and UFC fans.
[02:37:56.738 --> 02:37:58.359]  So I'm doing this takes a lot of courage.
[02:37:58.739 --> 02:38:01.200]  And that's why I really feel good about what Joe's done.
[02:38:01.220 --> 02:38:03.562]  I went way too far in attacking him.
[02:38:03.802 --> 02:38:08.304]  But once I do start attacking friends, I tend to go overboard because I don't normally do that.
[02:38:08.324 --> 02:38:10.245]  So I have to get an emotional state just to do it.
[02:38:10.305 --> 02:38:12.026]  Then it becomes a snowball.
[02:38:13.787 --> 02:38:19.450]  But now in hindsight, some of the things I did were over the top.
[02:38:19.470 --> 02:38:21.452]  So I apologize to Joe for that.
[02:38:21.492 --> 02:38:23.393]  But as Barry Goldwater said,
[02:38:24.383 --> 02:38:31.247]  Defense, radical defense of liberty, extremism and defense of liberty is no vice.
[02:38:31.267 --> 02:38:35.429]  Now let me shift gears into several clips I've got here.
[02:38:36.609 --> 02:38:46.815]  One is Nadler, one of the Democratic leaders, obviously in the House, spewing a bunch of bull on a New York street corner talking to the so-called news.
[02:38:47.775 --> 02:38:52.598]  And people are walking by saying, you're a loser, you're full of it, you're an idiot, you're trying to hold America back.
[02:38:54.713 --> 02:39:02.142]  There's another clip of Trump will play first but Netanyahu just about an hour ago saying he hopes this doesn't happen to future presidents.
[02:39:03.424 --> 02:39:08.971]  Well that's why Mr. President we have to go after the crimes that were committed here.
[02:39:10.312 --> 02:39:11.494]  That's why you have to go after
[02:39:13.328 --> 02:39:19.913]  Comey and the Clintons and especially McCabe, who you've got red-handed.
[02:39:20.373 --> 02:39:25.757]  Strzok and Lisa Page creating a fake investigation to try to remove you from office.
[02:39:25.797 --> 02:39:26.658]  That's called a coup.
[02:39:27.158 --> 02:39:28.419]  It's called illegal takedown.
[02:39:29.320 --> 02:39:30.480]  It's exactly what you called it.
[02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:32.322]  So, here's the deal.
[02:39:33.483 --> 02:39:37.425]  These criminals aren't gonna respect you unless you start going after some of them.
[02:39:37.906 --> 02:39:39.387]  Plus, are you gonna sleep good at night?
[02:39:41.618 --> 02:39:43.420]  Were these individuals just getting away with this?
[02:39:44.881 --> 02:39:47.023]  This is the boldest thing in modern world history.
[02:39:47.043 --> 02:39:49.765]  It's definitely the boldest thing in most of U.S.
[02:39:49.805 --> 02:39:50.105]  history.
[02:39:50.646 --> 02:39:51.887]  Stuff like this has not been pulled.
[02:39:52.387 --> 02:39:53.308]  This is very rare.
[02:39:53.708 --> 02:39:54.409]  Very dangerous.
[02:39:54.509 --> 02:40:09.982]  And I'd sleep a lot better at night if the Clintons were behind bars and Comey got indicted and something happened to these crooks to bust open the full story of what they're doing inside.
[02:40:11.203 --> 02:40:12.185]  And that's what we need.
[02:40:13.047 --> 02:40:19.562]  I've been fighting these folks hard to try to get us to the point of lock her up and now we're almost there and we need to complete this.
[02:40:21.749 --> 02:40:27.970]  You know, there's some monster that comes through the woods at night and occasionally, you know, a couple times a year tries to tear the back door off your house and eat your kids.
[02:40:28.570 --> 02:40:33.911]  And you catch the monster doing it and grab a machete and hack one of its arms off, but it runs off into the night.
[02:40:34.751 --> 02:40:41.573]  Well, if you follow the blood trail of the cave it lives in, you want to go in there and make sure it's been dispatched completely, politically, through the courts.
[02:40:41.613 --> 02:40:48.414]  I don't mean literally hack up Hillary with a machete, but I'm saying Grindle got his arm torn off and he's gone into that nest.
[02:40:49.446 --> 02:40:51.366]  And we think he's still alive in there.
[02:40:52.207 --> 02:40:53.267]  In this case, we know they are.
[02:40:53.967 --> 02:40:55.627]  There's a lot of stuff going on in that cave.
[02:40:56.067 --> 02:40:57.148]  Who knows how bad it is?
[02:40:57.208 --> 02:41:01.849]  We need to go in the cave, light the torches, and go in.
[02:41:02.889 --> 02:41:05.569]  And I've already, believe me, I've already been going to these caves for a long time.
[02:41:06.170 --> 02:41:07.690]  I've found a lot of nasty stuff.
[02:41:07.850 --> 02:41:11.451]  And our children aren't safe unless we finish the job.
[02:41:12.471 --> 02:41:14.471]  Because Grendel's got a mama.
[02:41:15.952 --> 02:41:17.712]  And mama is gonna pull some stuff.
[02:41:19.121 --> 02:41:21.202]  So I suggest we go ahead and go face mama.
[02:41:21.703 --> 02:41:22.763]  And just get this over with.
[02:41:23.164 --> 02:41:24.865]  There's always going to be problems, always going to be enemies.
[02:41:25.025 --> 02:41:25.945]  Well anyways, here's the president.
[02:41:27.306 --> 02:41:28.967]  I will tell you, I love this country.
[02:41:29.568 --> 02:41:32.830]  I love this country as much as I can love anything.
[02:41:32.910 --> 02:41:34.711]  My family, my country, my God.
[02:41:35.772 --> 02:41:41.115]  But what they did, it was a false narrative, it was a terrible thing.
[02:41:43.017 --> 02:41:46.059]  We can never let this happen to another president again.
[02:41:46.079 --> 02:41:48.000]  I can tell you that and I say it very strongly.
[02:41:49.694 --> 02:41:51.495]  Very few people I know could have handled it.
[02:41:52.556 --> 02:41:57.220]  We can never, ever let this happen to another president again.
[02:41:58.221 --> 02:41:59.622]  And what about what Tucker Carlson said?
[02:42:00.383 --> 02:42:07.789]  When Roger Stone, no Russia collusion, no Russia him, they claim he lied to Congress, saying he directly talked to WikiLeaks when he never did say that?
[02:42:08.530 --> 02:42:10.812]  So, yeah, of course pardon him.
[02:42:11.292 --> 02:42:12.594]  And I got called a Russian agent?
[02:42:13.494 --> 02:42:15.096]  Paul Watson got called a Russian agent?
[02:42:16.530 --> 02:42:17.231]  They turned U.S.
[02:42:17.271 --> 02:42:22.274]  intelligence agencies loose on us and have torn the living hell out of the First Amendment.
[02:42:23.515 --> 02:42:25.597]  And yeah, we're still in the fight.
[02:42:27.838 --> 02:42:29.780]  But this isn't over.
[02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:31.441]  Google's censoring the hell out of everybody?
[02:42:31.461 --> 02:42:34.323]  Yeah, Donald Trump's just tweeted this.
[02:42:34.903 --> 02:42:40.347]  If Roger Stone was indicted for lying to Congress, what about lying done by Comey, Brennan, Clapper, all of them?
[02:42:40.927 --> 02:42:41.468]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:41.488 --> 02:42:42.789]  I'm going to play the Nadler clip.
[02:42:44.008 --> 02:42:45.129]  And I'm going to play a couple other clips.
[02:42:45.609 --> 02:42:46.789]  Paul Watson's got a new report out.
[02:42:46.869 --> 02:42:53.432]  And then, coming up, we've got one of my favorite talk show hosts, Will Johnson, loaded for bear.
[02:42:54.113 --> 02:42:54.673]  Stay with us.
[02:42:54.753 --> 02:42:55.513]  Infowars.com.
[02:42:55.533 --> 02:42:57.214]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:42:57.234 --> 02:42:59.095]  Whatever you do, share those links.
[02:42:59.235 --> 02:43:00.215]  Newswars.com.
[02:43:02.356 --> 02:43:10.640]  In previous revolutions, some good, some bad, the revolutionaries funded themselves.
[02:43:13.945 --> 02:43:18.870]  Robbing trains full of silver or basically going through the countryside and pillaging.
[02:43:19.850 --> 02:43:24.354]  Well, we've been blessed the 21st century in this great free market system that we've got.
[02:43:26.096 --> 02:43:33.463]  To be able to just use the free market and high quality products and the rules of commerce to go out and get great products.
[02:43:34.924 --> 02:43:42.067]  That people get great results from and then discount those products to you so that it becomes the total 360 win.
[02:43:42.667 --> 02:43:48.169]  And I obsess over that term that I coined years ago because that's really what I believe in.
[02:43:48.229 --> 02:43:52.810]  It's a non-zero-sum game where everybody basically benefits.
[02:43:52.870 --> 02:43:58.012]  It's beyond just symbiotic where everybody kind of works with each other and everybody makes it.
[02:43:58.292 --> 02:44:00.773]  This is where we have an even better future together.
[02:44:02.033 --> 02:44:03.254]  And so we're not robbing banks here.
[02:44:04.284 --> 02:44:07.121]  We're not engaged in criminal activity to fund our operations.
[02:44:08.499 --> 02:44:11.542]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we are engaged in good old-fashioned free market.
[02:44:11.562 --> 02:44:15.105]  It doesn't mean the whole world's free market, it doesn't mean America's perfect free market.
[02:44:15.705 --> 02:44:22.491]  We have socialism, we have communist tendencies, we have these parasitic systems nesting inside the free market capitalist system.
[02:44:22.911 --> 02:44:33.640]  But Infowars itself is a pretty much pure form of Americana free market capitalism, and your participation in it is a beautiful part of that.
[02:44:34.301 --> 02:44:35.322]  So, throughout the month,
[02:44:36.448 --> 02:44:37.188]  The good news is
[02:45:05.896 --> 02:45:15.643]  After a year and a half long battle to secure the deep earth crystals that nobody else has for the purest atomic iodine out there, we have been able to secure X2.
[02:45:16.343 --> 02:45:17.864]  I was sure we weren't going to be able to get it.
[02:45:18.204 --> 02:45:20.986]  It's a derivative that the oil companies get between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[02:45:21.466 --> 02:45:32.594]  There's globalist industrial espionage that goes on where they try to not just take our sponsors and things, but actually stop us from getting the raw material because this is under DEA control to get the raw stuff because it's so powerful.
[02:45:33.154 --> 02:45:35.416]  So X2, after being sold out for several months,
[02:45:36.496 --> 02:45:40.698]  We were able to get it back into production from its original producer, and we now have it.
[02:45:41.078 --> 02:45:44.260]  And it is the purest, best, good halogen out there.
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:49.902]  Just research how IQs went down massively in the Midwest because they didn't have any iodine in the soil.
[02:45:50.242 --> 02:45:54.304]  Once the government added it, it just did all of these insanely good things.
[02:45:54.604 --> 02:45:55.185]  Research.
[02:45:55.805 --> 02:45:56.345]  It's incredible.
[02:45:56.585 --> 02:45:57.426]  One of God's great gifts.
[02:45:58.186 --> 02:45:59.026]  So X2's back.
[02:45:59.167 --> 02:46:00.167]  It's in about a week and a half.
[02:46:00.187 --> 02:46:01.748]  You can pre-order it at Infowarshore.com.
[02:46:01.768 --> 02:46:03.368]  I almost forgot.
[02:46:03.589 --> 02:46:06.590]  25% off out of the gates to celebrate the fact that it's back.
[02:46:06.630 --> 02:46:09.131]  I forgot that part.
[02:46:09.151 --> 02:46:10.011]  25% off X2.
[02:46:10.692 --> 02:46:11.692]  A lot of you have experienced it.
[02:46:11.712 --> 02:46:12.212]  You've loved it.
[02:46:12.272 --> 02:46:12.933]  A lot of you haven't.
[02:46:13.313 --> 02:46:13.813]  Try it out.
[02:46:13.853 --> 02:46:14.553]  Fund the operation.
[02:46:15.174 --> 02:46:17.195]  The bad news is, outside of our audience...
[02:46:18.015 --> 02:46:24.560]  People don't know that Iodine is needed for electrochemical activity in the brain, or for your hormones, or for everything that happens in your body.
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:28.983]  And if you don't have it, you absorb the bad allergens like Chlorine and Fluoride and other things.
[02:46:29.864 --> 02:46:33.166]  So get your X2 original today and share it with people.
[02:46:33.607 --> 02:46:35.828]  Tell them about the Iodine conspiracy.
[02:46:36.149 --> 02:46:38.530]  Because the bad news is a lot of people don't know.
[02:46:38.550 --> 02:46:38.571]  X2.
[02:46:41.277 --> 02:46:44.059]  It's been sold out for months, but it's coming back in right now.
[02:46:44.119 --> 02:46:47.021]  Good news for folks that are on AutoShip and InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:46:47.281 --> 02:46:50.083]  Sign up for AutoShip to make sure you get every month, every two months, whatever you want.
[02:46:50.323 --> 02:46:54.666]  Cancel any time and you will get 10% off additionally on 25% off.
[02:46:55.106 --> 02:46:55.947]  X2's back!
[02:46:56.307 --> 02:46:59.049]  Now explain to people how critical iodine is.
[02:46:59.129 --> 02:47:01.390]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[02:47:01.430 --> 02:47:02.131]  X2's back!
[02:47:05.733 --> 02:47:08.355]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.417 --> 02:47:22.674]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:31.494 --> 02:47:35.255]  Well, you heard a few hours ago that Michael Avenatti was indicted.
[02:47:35.295 --> 02:47:36.096]  Now he's been arrested.
[02:47:36.116 --> 02:47:37.536]  Tell you about that in a moment.
[02:47:38.456 --> 02:47:39.777]  Daryl, this is his transparency.
[02:47:40.397 --> 02:47:46.019]  Trump is a model of cooperation compared to Obama's stonewalling and delay and arresting reporters.
[02:47:46.159 --> 02:47:46.559]  Remember that?
[02:47:47.159 --> 02:47:47.780]  War on the press?
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:50.921]  I know, when you have a memory, stuff's just crazy.
[02:47:51.421 --> 02:47:55.182]  But the left really believes Trump's arresting all these reporters and a Nazi.
[02:47:56.942 --> 02:47:57.382]  I'm sorry.
[02:47:59.603 --> 02:48:02.084]  Austin is the world capital of allergies.
[02:48:02.164 --> 02:48:06.625]  It's recognized around the world as having the highest concentrations of pollen.
[02:48:08.165 --> 02:48:11.826]  Of anywhere except, strangely enough, you'd think it's like the Amazon.
[02:48:12.106 --> 02:48:12.326]  No?
[02:48:13.287 --> 02:48:14.387]  Knoxville, Tennessee.
[02:48:16.437 --> 02:48:19.118]  Has a lot of different plants and flora and fauna.
[02:48:21.238 --> 02:48:22.198]  So I grew up in Dallas.
[02:48:23.359 --> 02:48:25.099]  And it was mainly grassy plains up there.
[02:48:26.399 --> 02:48:28.920]  And I had friends that wouldn't want to go out and play baseball.
[02:48:28.940 --> 02:48:30.961]  They wouldn't want to go ride motorcycles, you know.
[02:48:33.561 --> 02:48:34.061]  Dirt bikes.
[02:48:34.301 --> 02:48:35.322]  They'd say, I got allergies.
[02:48:35.602 --> 02:48:37.222]  I thought that was a hypochondriac thing.
[02:48:39.983 --> 02:48:42.023]  Or we'd be playing football and kids' noses were running.
[02:48:42.043 --> 02:48:44.224]  And I'm like, you know, eighth grade, like, what are you, a wimp?
[02:48:45.401 --> 02:48:47.922]  Because I got sick like every five years or something, you know, the flu.
[02:48:52.845 --> 02:48:55.067]  And then I moved to Austin about two years into living here.
[02:48:55.087 --> 02:48:59.509]  I did a couple years of high school here, a couple in Dallas.
[02:49:00.270 --> 02:49:02.091]  I was like, Mom, I've been sick for two weeks.
[02:49:03.051 --> 02:49:04.332]  I just feel like I'm sitting around with fever.
[02:49:04.352 --> 02:49:05.773]  She goes, yeah, you got Cedar fever.
[02:49:05.973 --> 02:49:06.953]  Cedar's out right now.
[02:49:08.274 --> 02:49:09.335]  It's really a mountain juniper.
[02:49:10.603 --> 02:49:15.186]  So, that happens a couple times a year, then I get over it, and then I forget Oak hits at this time.
[02:49:15.286 --> 02:49:20.930]  So, you saw me earlier, had to go back to the Joe Rogan interview, even though I wasn't going to play at that point, because I couldn't talk.
[02:49:20.970 --> 02:49:22.211]  I was coughing and I didn't have a drink.
[02:49:23.252 --> 02:49:34.760]  And Daria walks in and talks about, really, the sleeper product here, that I never talk about, that I never promote, that doesn't make you feel like you're high, like Clarence and Dee or Zyrtec.
[02:49:36.696 --> 02:49:40.497]  Those will knock out your Cedar fever stuff in my experience but also makes you feel like hell.
[02:49:41.698 --> 02:49:47.819]  Pollen Block is from a special type of quail eggs and it's patented.
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:52.561]  All we do is search what's the best-selling highest rated but it's not popular in the U.S.
[02:49:53.800 --> 02:49:54.820]  Which is in Europe is popular.
[02:49:55.481 --> 02:49:58.402]  So we private label the highest quality here in the U.S.
[02:49:58.622 --> 02:49:59.262]  It's got a new bottle.
[02:49:59.282 --> 02:50:00.002]  The bottle was red.
[02:50:00.042 --> 02:50:03.084]  I said, let's make the bottle baby blue and yellow.
[02:50:03.124 --> 02:50:03.604]  So we did.
[02:50:03.624 --> 02:50:05.444]  We don't know why I made that decision, but here it is.
[02:50:07.005 --> 02:50:08.706]  Seasonal discomfort support.
[02:50:09.886 --> 02:50:10.466]  Pollen block.
[02:50:11.447 --> 02:50:16.529]  And you got to go read about this because the first day you take it, you're going to result in like 30 minutes.
[02:50:16.589 --> 02:50:19.490]  But it's, in my experience, cuts back maybe half your symptoms.
[02:50:20.862 --> 02:50:25.125]  But in my experience, a couple days into taking it, why I forget to take it, I'm crazy.
[02:50:25.465 --> 02:50:27.927]  One reason was it was sold out for months and the bottle I had at home was gone.
[02:50:27.947 --> 02:50:29.508]  So I'm going to stockpile this.
[02:50:29.528 --> 02:50:37.394]  Supposed to take two of these babies and look at me, TV viewers, you chew these up and they hit within 30 minutes.
[02:50:39.135 --> 02:50:40.036]  And they don't taste bad either.
[02:50:41.197 --> 02:50:41.617]  How sweet.
[02:50:45.460 --> 02:50:48.082]  No additives, no preservatives, no nothing.
[02:50:50.728 --> 02:50:51.709]  The special quail.
[02:50:52.849 --> 02:50:54.711]  They learned that people that live in these areas of France.
[02:50:56.192 --> 02:50:57.273]  And you ate these quail eggs.
[02:50:57.293 --> 02:50:58.593]  There's a French eat a lot of quail eggs.
[02:50:58.613 --> 02:51:00.054]  A lot of quail period.
[02:51:01.075 --> 02:51:01.876]  Didn't get allergies.
[02:51:02.456 --> 02:51:03.657]  It's happened back in the 50s.
[02:51:04.858 --> 02:51:08.020]  And they've learned to people try to breed these certain type of quail other places.
[02:51:08.100 --> 02:51:08.620]  It doesn't work.
[02:51:08.660 --> 02:51:09.161]  It's got to be.
[02:51:10.422 --> 02:51:17.366]  From France, and it's they're just immersed in pollen and dust and these birds that the seeds they eat their body just knows how to deal with it.
[02:51:18.167 --> 02:51:18.928]  And somehow then.
[02:51:19.963 --> 02:51:27.265]  Whatever the protein is in the egg shell is transferred to you and it's amazing.
[02:51:28.825 --> 02:51:32.566]  Pollen Baroque from InfoWars Life and it gets into what it does.
[02:51:32.626 --> 02:51:43.609]  Helps support sinus function, helps enhance respiratory function, promotes clear airway passage and normal breathing, promotes respiratory health and normal breathing, supports eye comfort and sinus health.
[02:51:44.249 --> 02:51:47.390]  Powerful ingredients inside include your bottle of
[02:51:49.730 --> 02:51:54.135]  Life immune wall include quail egg concentrate.
[02:51:55.937 --> 02:52:02.624]  In decades ago, researchers in France discovered the ability of certain quail eggs to alleviate seasonal related symptoms when eaten.
[02:52:04.285 --> 02:52:07.208]  And sorbitol, tooth friendly, low calorie sugar.
[02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:09.871]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:52:10.752 --> 02:52:11.293]  Get your
[02:52:13.171 --> 02:52:13.571]  Pollen.
[02:52:14.672 --> 02:52:15.012]  Block.
[02:52:15.412 --> 02:52:15.773]  Today.
[02:52:16.473 --> 02:52:18.914]  And I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
[02:52:19.455 --> 02:52:22.216]  4.7 stars, 94% reviews.
[02:52:23.497 --> 02:52:28.160]  And I'm told it works basically for everybody, but you've got experience for yourself.
[02:52:28.220 --> 02:52:28.860]  Why not try it?
[02:52:29.261 --> 02:52:31.122]  You're supporting the broadcast, so you really can't lose.
[02:52:31.142 --> 02:52:33.683]  Okay, I said I'm gonna get to Paul's report.
[02:52:35.324 --> 02:52:36.525]  So Will Johnson will be okay.
[02:52:37.065 --> 02:52:37.566]  I'm going to
[02:52:39.639 --> 02:52:44.343]  Go ahead and do part of the second segment so I can get Paul's report out, and then Will Johnson will take over.
[02:52:44.643 --> 02:52:48.526]  So we'll start the second segment with Paul Joseph Watson's The Truth About Russia Collusion.
[02:52:48.606 --> 02:52:49.707]  It's very powerful.
[02:52:51.788 --> 02:52:52.549]  And a lot more.
[02:52:52.729 --> 02:52:56.752]  But let's go ahead and go to Congressman Nadler.
[02:52:57.893 --> 02:53:07.260]  And this needs to happen when the Democrats go out to their constituents, when they go to balls, when they go to events, when they're on local radio you should call in, when they're out in the public.
[02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:08.040]  Don't be vicious.
[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.661]  Don't be hateful.
[02:53:09.431 --> 02:53:11.212]  Let's just Bill Clinton, you know, say, hey, you're a rapist.
[02:53:12.533 --> 02:53:14.114]  But just point out what scum they are.
[02:53:14.134 --> 02:53:20.819]  Because they're telling Antifa to go out and run us out of restaurants, and run us out of grocery stores, and run us out of gas stations.
[02:53:20.859 --> 02:53:22.280]  No, don't run them out of places.
[02:53:23.561 --> 02:53:28.084]  And if they're with their family, leave them alone when they're eating dinner with their family.
[02:53:29.305 --> 02:53:36.890]  But, they get up by themselves to leave, or they're going outside, go over and tell them, hey, I don't like what you're doing, I don't appreciate it, we see through you.
[02:53:38.359 --> 02:53:38.699]  That's it.
[02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:42.561]  We're not going to lower ourselves to their level, but we're going to do stuff like this.
[02:53:42.581 --> 02:53:43.361]  So here's Nadler.
[02:53:44.401 --> 02:53:47.903]  We tried to exercise executive privilege, but it won't be successful.
[02:53:48.523 --> 02:53:52.024]  Executive privilege must be asserted by the president personally.
[02:53:52.485 --> 02:53:58.547]  And as the Nixon case in front of the Supreme Court, which was decided 9-0, pointed out,
[02:54:04.036 --> 02:54:07.839]  Executive privilege cannot be used to shield or hide wrongdoing.
[02:54:09.380 --> 02:54:19.327]  In the case of Nixon, the tapes of his personal conversations with people were ordered revealed by the court, so I don't think that executive privilege will be a very successful defense here.
[02:54:19.367 --> 02:54:24.651]  Mr. Chairman, ABC News, the Speaker and Leader Schumer are tonight questioning what they say is the Attorney General's bias.
[02:54:24.751 --> 02:54:28.534]  Is that fair, and do you have confidence in the Attorney General?
[02:54:32.617 --> 02:54:36.238]  Well it is fair, and in fact I questioned it if you listen to what I said.
[02:54:38.539 --> 02:54:52.945]  So there he is, continuing to act like Trump's guilty of something when there's nothing there, and then they criminally surveilled him during the campaign, when he was president-elect, when he was president they got caught lying about it, and they committed all these crimes.
[02:54:53.565 --> 02:54:58.727]  We must go on the offense or they're going to continue to pull the criminal actions.
[02:55:00.410 --> 02:55:01.030]  It's incredible.
[02:55:01.370 --> 02:55:02.490]  And we must stop Google.
[02:55:02.910 --> 02:55:06.651]  It's openly, according to top computer scientists, that they've published the results.
[02:55:06.671 --> 02:55:07.751]  We can all see it ourselves.
[02:55:08.091 --> 02:55:10.052]  Not even showing you conservative candidates.
[02:55:10.452 --> 02:55:11.452]  Showing you lies.
[02:55:11.732 --> 02:55:14.412]  Saying all the Republicans in key states are Nazis.
[02:55:14.953 --> 02:55:16.833]  It says party affiliation.
[02:55:16.953 --> 02:55:17.773]  Nazi party.
[02:55:21.294 --> 02:55:21.934]  It's crazy.
[02:55:24.814 --> 02:55:28.395]  And then Google gets caught helping build weapon systems for China.
[02:55:32.230 --> 02:55:34.494]  By the way, I forgot the key point getting into Pollen Block.
[02:55:34.514 --> 02:55:40.104]  I was telling you why Daria came in and said, take your Pollen Block.
[02:55:41.468 --> 02:55:47.550]  I forget with allergies, because I won't take Claritin, and I won't take these other things because it makes me a speed freak, and it makes me rude.
[02:55:48.250 --> 02:56:01.334]  A few times I have anger issues, it's when I go, man, I got horrible allergies, let me take a Claritin, let me take a... And this is not a drug, this is what Mother Nature gave you, these quail eggs that eat these certain diets, that have something secreted that's an antihistamine, that nature gave us.
[02:56:01.354 --> 02:56:05.815]  Kind of like Tumerix, this great, you know, anti-inflammatory God gave us, with our bodies.
[02:56:05.855 --> 02:56:08.096]  But my point is, I'm just like you.
[02:56:09.210 --> 02:56:10.953]  I don't think I made that point.
[02:56:21.275 --> 02:56:24.738]  Oh yeah, I've got something I can take for this that actually works for me.
[02:56:25.438 --> 02:56:27.580]  That was the point I wanted to add about Pollen Block.
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:34.325]  Storewide free shipping, 50% off all the supplements, including Pollen Block, except for some of the best sellers, which we're going to have to end.
[02:56:34.365 --> 02:56:39.169]  We already had to end the protein bars and Turbo Force because those have basically sold out.
[02:56:39.630 --> 02:56:41.972]  They've gone back to regular price because more doesn't come in for at least a month.
[02:56:42.532 --> 02:56:44.474]  But Brain Force Plus, amazing nootropic.
[02:56:45.194 --> 02:56:46.916]  For the brain, focus, you name it.
[02:56:47.276 --> 02:56:49.118]  Clarity, 60% off, folks love it.
[02:56:49.518 --> 02:56:50.419]  That's at cost.
[02:56:50.459 --> 02:56:52.380]  DNA Force, 60% off, that's at cost.
[02:56:52.781 --> 02:56:54.462]  Knockout Sleep Aid, that's at cost.
[02:56:54.783 --> 02:56:56.664]  Silverbola, 60% off, that's at cost.
[02:56:57.085 --> 02:57:00.928]  Bodies, 50% off, 60% off.
[02:57:01.148 --> 02:57:05.832]  Real Red Pill Plus, those are 60% off with store-wide free shipping and double-patron points.
[02:57:06.133 --> 02:57:07.254]  You cannot beat those deals.
[02:57:08.857 --> 02:57:11.959]  And get a t-shirt while you're there because that's how you meet like-minded people.
[02:57:12.019 --> 02:57:14.541]  Sure, you don't need to wear a big M4 shirt in the leftist area.
[02:57:14.701 --> 02:57:15.462]  I don't recommend it.
[02:57:15.662 --> 02:57:17.363]  They don't care if you have kids with you, they'll attack.
[02:57:17.764 --> 02:57:20.546]  They'll throw things in your face, they'll rob you, they'll spit on you.
[02:57:20.566 --> 02:57:23.248]  A lot of times they'll go, I love Satan, and run off.
[02:57:23.288 --> 02:57:23.908]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[02:57:23.968 --> 02:57:25.590]  It's like mass demon possession.
[02:57:26.230 --> 02:57:28.752]  But if you're wearing them all on lave, leftists don't speak Latin.
[02:57:28.772 --> 02:57:29.412]  They don't know what it means.
[02:57:29.432 --> 02:57:32.575]  You know, come and take it.
[02:57:33.755 --> 02:57:38.118]  A Molon Labe, a News Wars, a Space Force shirt.
[02:57:38.798 --> 02:57:39.979]  All those are awesome.
[02:57:40.699 --> 02:57:44.021]  And they help you spread the word and meet blind and blinded people in Forest War.com.
[02:57:44.141 --> 02:57:49.844]  Okay, I'm gonna come back with a Paul Joseph Watson report and some other news on Avenatti's now been arrested.
[02:57:55.376 --> 02:57:58.799]  I cannot say enough nice things about Super Male Vitality right here.
[02:57:59.100 --> 02:58:00.441]  I actually have three of them on my desk.
[02:58:00.481 --> 02:58:01.302]  This is my favorite.
[02:58:01.342 --> 02:58:03.884]  It's heartbreaking that it's going away, I really think.
[02:58:04.265 --> 02:58:05.165]  I mean, really, it's true.
[02:58:05.225 --> 02:58:08.248]  Ever since I've tried these two here, I've also got another one sitting here.
[02:58:08.408 --> 02:58:10.370]  Alpha Power, Super Male Vitality.
[02:58:10.470 --> 02:58:13.413]  They have given me the energy that I did not have.
[02:58:13.433 --> 02:58:17.377]  I mean, my God, I didn't realize how little I was doing before with these two here.
[02:58:17.697 --> 02:58:21.978]  I have the energy to go to the gym at the end of a long day of working at the end of doing a broadcast.
[02:58:22.058 --> 02:58:23.339]  I have the energy to go to a gym.
[02:58:23.419 --> 02:58:26.900]  And frankly, I really think this is better than anything you're going to get in the store.
[02:58:26.960 --> 02:58:27.740]  It's heartbreaking.
[02:58:27.780 --> 02:58:30.001]  The super male vitality is about to go away.
[02:58:30.041 --> 02:58:33.402]  And again, it's just because you can't find the herbs and you don't want to sell us crap.
[02:58:33.422 --> 02:58:34.663]  Yeah, but that's what it's all about.
[02:58:34.703 --> 02:58:35.884]  This is the real deal.
[02:58:35.924 --> 02:58:40.669]  You take two droplets of this a couple times a day and all of a sudden it's like, whoa, I'm a man again!
[02:58:40.929 --> 02:58:46.054]  I have all the power that a steady diet of soy fed through government schools robbed me of.
[02:58:46.134 --> 02:58:46.755]  It's back!
[02:58:47.135 --> 02:58:49.778]  So between that, I've got my X2 right here.
[02:58:49.918 --> 02:58:54.702]  Everything else I've tried, I have a filter in my house, a water filter I just bought for my family.
[02:58:54.842 --> 02:58:55.503]  Everybody loves
[02:58:55.503 --> 02:59:00.385]  These are exciting times we live in, and yes, super male vitality or female vitality is an aging process, it's cold-pressed, it takes three to four times
[02:59:21.513 --> 02:59:21.993]  I think.
[02:59:22.013 --> 02:59:22.173]  I think.
[02:59:22.213 --> 02:59:22.714]  I think.
[02:59:22.774 --> 02:59:23.094]  I think.
[02:59:23.114 --> 02:59:23.354]  I think.
[02:59:23.374 --> 02:59:23.874]  I think.
[02:59:23.894 --> 02:59:24.254]  I think.
[02:59:24.274 --> 02:59:24.675]  I think.
[02:59:24.735 --> 02:59:24.955]  I think.
[02:59:25.015 --> 02:59:25.255]  I think.
[02:59:25.275 --> 02:59:25.495]  I think.
[02:59:25.515 --> 02:59:25.695]  I think.
[02:59:25.735 --> 02:59:26.055]  I think.
[02:59:26.075 --> 02:59:26.295]  I think.
[02:59:26.315 --> 02:59:26.696]  I think.
[02:59:26.716 --> 02:59:26.876]  I think.
[02:59:26.896 --> 02:59:27.036]  I think.
[02:59:27.056 --> 02:59:27.216]  I think.
[02:59:27.236 --> 02:59:27.416]  I think.
[02:59:27.456 --> 02:59:27.636]  I think.
[02:59:27.656 --> 02:59:27.896]  I think.
[02:59:27.976 --> 02:59:28.216]  I think.
[02:59:28.276 --> 02:59:28.456]  I think.
[02:59:28.477 --> 02:59:28.717]  I think.
[02:59:28.777 --> 02:59:29.097]  I think.
[02:59:29.117 --> 02:59:29.337]  I think.
[02:59:29.357 --> 02:59:29.497]  I think.
[02:59:29.517 --> 02:59:29.717]  I think.
[02:59:29.737 --> 02:59:29.877]  I think.
[02:59:29.897 --> 02:59:30.117]  I think.
[02:59:30.137 --> 02:59:30.297]  I think.
[02:59:30.317 --> 02:59:30.558]  I think.
[02:59:30.618 --> 02:59:30.818]  I think.
[02:59:30.838 --> 02:59:31.098]  I think.
[02:59:31.158 --> 02:59:31.398]  I think.
[02:59:31.418 --> 02:59:31.598]  I think.
[02:59:31.618 --> 02:59:31.878]  I think.
[02:59:31.898 --> 02:59:32.238]  I think.
[02:59:32.278 --> 02:59:32.418]  I think.
[02:59:32.479 --> 02:59:32.839]  I think.
[02:59:32.859 --> 02:59:33.059]  I think.
[02:59:33.119 --> 02:59:33.439]  I think.
[02:59:33.459 --> 02:59:33.839]  I think.
[02:59:33.859 --> 02:59:34.199]  I think.
[02:59:34.219 --> 02:59:34.439]  I think.
[02:59:34.720 --> 02:59:35.060]  I think.
[02:59:35.080 --> 02:59:35.260]  I think.
[02:59:35.280 --> 02:59:35.460]  I think.
[02:59:35.480 --> 02:59:35.680]  I think.
[02:59:35.780 --> 02:59:36.220]  I think.
[02:59:36.240 --> 02:59:36.440]  I think.
[02:59:36.481 --> 02:59:36.681]  I think.
[02:59:36.721 --> 02:59:36.981]  I think.
[02:59:37.001 --> 02:59:37.181]  I think.
[02:59:37.241 --> 02:59:37.441]  I think.
[02:59:37.461 --> 02:59:37.641]  I think.
[02:59:37.681 --> 02:59:37.881]  I think.
[02:59:37.901 --> 02:59:38.081]  I think.
[02:59:38.121 --> 02:59:38.381]  I think.
[02:59:38.401 --> 02:59:38.562]  I think.
[02:59:38.602 --> 02:59:38.902]  I think.
[02:59:38.942 --> 02:59:39.202]  I think.
[02:59:39.242 --> 02:59:39.522]  I think.
[02:59:39.542 --> 02:59:39.722]  I think.
[02:59:39.762 --> 02:59:39.962]  I think.
[02:59:39.982 --> 02:59:40.282]  I think.
[02:59:40.342 --> 02:59:40.643]  I think.
[02:59:40.723 --> 02:59:40.863]  I think.
[02:59:40.883 --> 02:59:41.043]  I think.
[02:59:41.063 --> 02:59:41.283]  I think.
[02:59:41.603 --> 02:59:41.783]  I think.
[02:59:41.863 --> 02:59:42.043]  I think.
[02:59:42.083 --> 02:59:42.263]  I think.
[02:59:42.283 --> 02:59:42.423]  I think.
[02:59:42.544 --> 02:59:42.784]  I think
[02:59:56.375 --> 03:00:00.019]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:00.120 --> 03:00:01.842]  It's mind control.
[03:00:01.942 --> 03:00:07.688]  Mind control.
[03:00:08.329 --> 03:00:11.092]  Corruption of your thoughts.
[03:00:11.493 --> 03:00:13.255]  Destruction of your soul.
[03:00:28.877 --> 03:00:33.542]  Folks, we're back live here and I was just googling my name.
[03:00:51.630 --> 03:00:56.893]  I was just checking stuff out here and I noticed Media Matters has put out their latest BS spin.
[03:00:56.913 --> 03:00:59.194]  You can just document cam shot here if you need to.
[03:00:59.635 --> 03:01:04.857]  Alex Jones reacts to Miller Report summary by expressing his willingness to execute traitors.
[03:01:04.877 --> 03:01:09.040]  Then they go on to claim that I'm talking about Rachel Maddow.
[03:01:10.097 --> 03:01:10.918]  None of that is true.
[03:01:11.678 --> 03:01:13.180]  That is all more garbage.
[03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:24.469]  What happens is, we got a great crew in here, but we don't script everything like an hour-long CNN show where every graphic that goes up is exactly what we mean to show or whatever.
[03:01:25.049 --> 03:01:26.991]  Everybody's seen mainstream news put the wrong graphics up.
[03:01:27.932 --> 03:01:38.821]  I was talking about how Jeff Bezos, who I'm always critical of for a lot of reasons, never sold us out to China, never helped round up political dissidents, never ran slave factories.
[03:01:40.663 --> 03:01:52.420]  As bad as some of their problems are and how I'm sick of being called a traitor because traitors get executed and I said and it's not my department that people ever found guilty of treason.
[03:01:53.479 --> 03:01:54.340]  To execute, folks.
[03:01:54.900 --> 03:02:00.605]  But that, you know, if we found heads of American companies were actually Chinese agents, I'd kick the levers all day.
[03:02:00.965 --> 03:02:04.088]  And somebody in there, because it's, you know, and I'm not mad at them.
[03:02:04.128 --> 03:02:05.049]  It's the way the show works.
[03:02:05.089 --> 03:02:08.111]  I could have it where I have to prove a graphic, was surfing through, they're punching buttons.
[03:02:08.131 --> 03:02:11.934]  You see it all the time where a pop-up pops up or there's the wrong picture and they move it.
[03:02:12.114 --> 03:02:13.456]  It's part of the fun of live TV.
[03:02:14.136 --> 03:02:19.478]  Rachel Maddow pops up, because we've just been talking about Rachel Maddow, crying over Russiagate.
[03:02:19.778 --> 03:02:22.039]  So they got all these channels, all these computer screens open.
[03:02:22.219 --> 03:02:23.219]  Somebody punched that up.
[03:02:23.459 --> 03:02:30.602]  So during me talking about traitors at Google, Maddow pops up, and that turns into, I want to hang Rachel Maddow.
[03:02:30.882 --> 03:02:33.563]  No, I don't wish any harm upon Rachel Maddow.
[03:02:33.963 --> 03:02:35.624]  And Media Matters knows that.
[03:02:37.947 --> 03:02:42.051]  It just absolutely never ends with these people and how deceptive they are.
[03:02:42.131 --> 03:02:44.293]  But that's what they do.
[03:02:45.214 --> 03:02:47.195]  That's who they are.
[03:02:47.736 --> 03:02:51.179]  And people know that's who they are.
[03:02:53.481 --> 03:02:55.923]  And you read the Media Matters comments, people are like, how you going?
[03:02:55.943 --> 03:02:57.004]  You like being deplatformed?
[03:02:57.024 --> 03:02:57.925]  You like being shut down?
[03:02:58.545 --> 03:03:00.447]  It's all coming out what's happened.
[03:03:00.807 --> 03:03:01.748]  You're getting in trouble.
[03:03:02.048 --> 03:03:02.749]  You're losing.
[03:03:03.169 --> 03:03:04.771]  Your corrupt lawyers are going to jail.
[03:03:06.274 --> 03:03:11.817]  The deplatforming of InfoWars in a sick way because of our listeners standing firm and taking action got bigger.
[03:03:12.537 --> 03:03:15.558]  I'm more mobbed on the street positively than ever before.
[03:03:15.979 --> 03:03:25.123]  I went into a cafe at 1030 in the morning to have a late breakfast brunch with my wife and my oldest daughter, and no one was in there.
[03:03:26.143 --> 03:03:35.508]  But just through the window, people saw me and 10-year-old kids and 7-year-old kids with their parents came in and wanted autographs.
[03:03:36.923 --> 03:03:39.445]  And when I walked outside, people wanted to shake my hand.
[03:03:40.826 --> 03:03:41.647]  It's not working.
[03:03:42.207 --> 03:03:43.588]  But with the left, they don't care.
[03:03:44.589 --> 03:03:49.032]  They want the simulation in their mind that we've been defeated.
[03:03:49.793 --> 03:03:57.398]  And they believe in their own echo bubble world that if they lie about me and lie about what I've said about Sandy Hook and things, that it has this big effect.
[03:03:57.939 --> 03:04:03.283]  Only with NPR and CNN viewers, who are already believing everything you tell them.
[03:04:03.903 --> 03:04:05.164]  They believe I'm a Russian agent.
[03:04:05.204 --> 03:04:06.045]  They believe all this crap.
[03:04:08.106 --> 03:04:08.966]  So, it's incredible.
[03:04:09.086 --> 03:04:11.047]  It's not working anymore.
[03:04:11.187 --> 03:04:13.167]  I don't believe in any offensive violence.
[03:04:15.167 --> 03:04:18.708]  They had the Pentagon, the FBI, and the CIA investigate me as a traitor.
[03:04:19.908 --> 03:04:21.228]  Punishable by execution.
[03:04:22.588 --> 03:04:27.749]  And I said, Google and Apple are working in China to engage in high treason.
[03:04:29.270 --> 03:04:31.290]  And that they need to be charged.
[03:04:32.250 --> 03:04:33.370]  That they need to be indicted.
[03:04:33.430 --> 03:04:34.911]  They need to be brought to justice.
[03:04:35.591 --> 03:04:36.971]  And you turn that into Rachel Maddow.
[03:04:38.055 --> 03:04:38.475]  Good try.
[03:04:38.495 --> 03:04:42.537]  Has nothing to do with Rachel Maddow.
[03:04:42.557 --> 03:04:44.058]  Remember when they popped her up for a minute?
[03:04:44.078 --> 03:04:45.638]  I just don't want to sound like I'm bashing on the crew.
[03:04:46.199 --> 03:04:47.459]  I'm not talking about Rachel Maddow.
[03:04:47.519 --> 03:04:49.680]  I'm talking about anybody found guilty of treason.
[03:04:50.521 --> 03:04:52.081]  She's just guilty of being a propagandist.
[03:04:52.321 --> 03:04:52.902]  But I didn't do it.
[03:04:53.202 --> 03:04:56.143]  But from now on, when my gut tells me, I'm going to do it.
[03:04:56.303 --> 03:04:58.984]  Because hey, the crew's great, but they... Stuff like that happens.
[03:04:59.345 --> 03:05:01.766]  When you got 20 channels up.
[03:05:03.382 --> 03:05:07.245]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[03:05:08.026 --> 03:05:11.829]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[03:05:12.269 --> 03:05:19.295]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[03:05:20.216 --> 03:05:22.438]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[03:05:23.338 --> 03:05:26.821]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[03:05:28.142 --> 03:05:31.104]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[03:05:31.284 --> 03:05:32.825]  We are the power structure.
[03:05:33.305 --> 03:05:34.365]  We are the inventors.
[03:05:34.926 --> 03:05:35.966]  We are the trailblazers.
[03:05:36.707 --> 03:05:39.548]  And the globalists understand that.
[03:05:40.088 --> 03:05:46.051]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[03:05:47.212 --> 03:05:51.014]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[03:05:52.063 --> 03:06:01.045]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping and 50% off at importstore.com.
[03:06:01.165 --> 03:06:02.565]  Something everybody should take advantage of.
[03:06:09.927 --> 03:06:11.127]  We're on the march.
[03:06:11.587 --> 03:06:12.987]  The empire's on the run.
[03:06:13.007 --> 03:06:14.768]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:06:15.588 --> 03:06:17.408]  Bill Johnson is about to take over.
[03:06:17.488 --> 03:06:20.389]  Very informed and dynamic individual.
[03:06:22.406 --> 03:06:23.847]  The left is not going to give up.
[03:06:23.887 --> 03:06:25.628]  They're going to get more shrill, more criminal.
[03:06:25.928 --> 03:06:27.729]  They're going to stage more Jussie Smollett things.
[03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:29.751]  They're going to take more things out of context.
[03:06:29.791 --> 03:06:32.993]  They're going to try to censor more, brigade more, harass more.
[03:06:34.133 --> 03:06:50.684]  But we have reports now that have gone live on InfoWars.com with top computer scientists proving Google stole the 2018 elections and live time video where we prove Google and YouTube are fixing search results.
[03:06:51.803 --> 03:06:54.356]  This is incredible and anybody can duplicate it themselves.
[03:06:55.401 --> 03:06:56.262]  It's very important.
[03:06:56.282 --> 03:06:57.363]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[03:06:57.403 --> 03:06:59.444]  Will Johnson is about to take over.
[03:06:59.484 --> 03:07:01.066]  Please don't forget, we're Lister Supported.
[03:07:01.526 --> 03:07:02.547]  Free shipping store-wide.
[03:07:03.568 --> 03:07:04.549]  50 to 60% off.
[03:07:04.749 --> 03:07:05.930]  This is our biggest sell ever.
[03:07:05.950 --> 03:07:06.871]  It even tops Christmas.
[03:07:07.611 --> 03:07:09.613]  I guess they decided to have some items be 60% off.
[03:07:10.073 --> 03:07:11.394]  And this is how we fund our operations.
[03:07:11.554 --> 03:07:12.816]  Stock up on high-quality coffee.
[03:07:13.316 --> 03:07:17.159]  Stock up on high-quality fluoride-free colloidal silver iodine-fortified toothpaste.
[03:07:17.720 --> 03:07:19.101]  Stock up on fish oil.
[03:07:19.121 --> 03:07:20.082]  Stock up on turmeric.
[03:07:20.422 --> 03:07:22.444]  Stock up on things you're going to need each month.
[03:07:23.311 --> 03:07:29.294]  I can say stock up on the energy bars, the protein bars, all that, but they've sold out or about to as we went back to regular price.
[03:07:29.834 --> 03:07:37.137]  Infowarsstore.com and thank you all for standing with us and thank you, by the way, to this great crew and the amazing job that they do as well.
[03:07:37.297 --> 03:07:41.659]  The War Room is coming up in T-minus 53 minutes with Owen Schroyer.
[03:07:42.079 --> 03:07:45.841]  His co-host is Roger Stone, but he's a political prisoner, so he can't come on right now.
[03:07:46.661 --> 03:07:49.563]  There's been a lot of other insane developments today, obviously.
[03:07:50.683 --> 03:07:59.954]  Man, we're trying to gauge what's happening there and deal with it, but we're in the thick of the fight for this country, but we're... We're in sudden death over time with the globalists.
[03:08:00.655 --> 03:08:01.195]  Toe to toe.
[03:08:01.616 --> 03:08:05.841]  But we have the initiative, and we're driving down the field, and they don't know what to do.
[03:08:06.321 --> 03:08:10.226]  It's like a 99-yard drive, and we're 10 yards from the end zone right now.
[03:08:16.587 --> 03:08:20.209]  You can feel the energy and the enemy had such horrible plans for all of us.
[03:08:20.989 --> 03:08:27.032]  They love to bully kids, they love to target the unborn, now the born, but everything slips into their hands right now and they don't know what to do.
[03:08:27.692 --> 03:08:33.515]  The inferiority complex of the evil ones, they just are beside themselves because they were finally about to rule Earth.
[03:08:34.135 --> 03:08:37.437]  Let's go ahead and go to Paul Watson's report, then Will Johnson.
[03:08:38.703 --> 03:08:52.702]  So the same media that relentlessly calls me a fake news conspiracy theorist just spent the last two years pushing what turned out to be the biggest fake news conspiracy theory since Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction.
[03:08:52.782 --> 03:08:53.643]  Who's the conspiracy theorist?
[03:08:53.743 --> 03:09:05.557]  As Rolling Stone's Matt Taibbi writes, WMD damaged the media's reputation, Russiagate may have destroyed it.
[03:09:05.637 --> 03:09:13.467]  The same media that abuses its platform to de-platform and silence others for fake news and misinformation.
[03:09:13.507 --> 03:09:27.238]  When they generated and hyped the largest, most harmful piece of fake news and misinformation for two years solid, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have all vowed to crack down on fake news and conspiracy theories.
[03:09:27.418 --> 03:09:40.349]  CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post and every late night comedian all threw their weight behind a conspiracy theory that caused division across the country and undermined democracy.
[03:09:40.429 --> 03:09:42.311]  What punishment will they face?
[03:09:42.631 --> 03:09:44.231]  Will their channels be deleted?
[03:09:44.471 --> 03:09:46.572]  Will they be relegated in the algorithm?
[03:09:47.152 --> 03:09:48.032]  Don't hold your breath!
[03:09:48.232 --> 03:09:51.973]  Alex Jones was wiped out for saying something he apologised for.
[03:09:52.093 --> 03:09:57.955]  Yet the mass media pushed a narrative that destabilised the nation and could have sparked a war.
[03:09:58.195 --> 03:09:59.735]  And nothing will happen to them.
[03:10:00.095 --> 03:10:01.896]  None of them will be held accountable.
[03:10:01.996 --> 03:10:08.057]  For two years solid, every night they told us that the Trump administration was on the verge of collapse.
[03:10:08.237 --> 03:10:08.937]  Breaking news.
[03:10:09.218 --> 03:10:10.078]  A bombshell.
[03:10:10.138 --> 03:10:11.599]  Today is a turning point.
[03:10:11.619 --> 03:10:13.740]  Today was historically bad for President Trump.
[03:10:13.760 --> 03:10:15.541]  Today was a turning point.
[03:10:15.561 --> 03:10:16.361]  A turning point.
[03:10:16.421 --> 03:10:17.442]  We're at a turning point here.
[03:10:17.462 --> 03:10:20.564]  The beginning of the end for the Trump presidency.
[03:10:20.604 --> 03:10:21.884]  We have another bombshell.
[03:10:21.944 --> 03:10:24.886]  Mike Pence might have to assume the office of the presidency.
[03:10:24.926 --> 03:10:26.567]  Rumblings of the word impeachment.
[03:10:26.707 --> 03:10:27.567]  Breaking news.
[03:10:27.668 --> 03:10:29.168]  Another bombshell out of the White House.
[03:10:29.368 --> 03:10:30.569]  I believe this is the beginning of the end.
[03:10:30.869 --> 03:10:31.409]  I do too.
[03:10:31.489 --> 03:10:32.990]  It's really the beginning of the end.
[03:10:33.010 --> 03:10:35.071]  He may be feeling the walls closing in on him.
[03:10:35.171 --> 03:10:36.872]  All the walls closing in on him.
[03:10:36.892 --> 03:10:38.873]  The walls closing in on him.
[03:10:38.933 --> 03:10:40.314]  Breaking news, a new bombshell.
[03:10:40.414 --> 03:10:44.116]  One astrologer says this means the beginning of the end for President Donald Trump.
[03:10:44.136 --> 03:10:45.016]  Trump will resign.
[03:10:45.036 --> 03:10:46.117]  Trump is going to resign.
[03:10:46.357 --> 03:10:47.637]  Is this the tipping point?
[03:10:47.717 --> 03:10:49.998]  I know we've said it over and over.
[03:10:50.078 --> 03:10:51.278]  You think this is a tipping point?
[03:10:51.318 --> 03:10:52.418]  And over and over.
[03:10:52.478 --> 03:10:53.799]  This is a tipping point.
[03:10:53.859 --> 03:10:54.979]  And over and over.
[03:10:54.999 --> 03:10:57.000]  Breaking news, President Trump off the rails.
[03:10:57.020 --> 03:10:58.300]  It was the beginning of the end today.
[03:10:58.360 --> 03:10:59.480]  The beginning of the end.
[03:10:59.540 --> 03:11:01.201]  Breaking news tonight, new bombshell.
[03:11:01.221 --> 03:11:02.581]  This is the beginning of the end.
[03:11:02.821 --> 03:11:04.161]  The beginning of the end.
[03:11:04.201 --> 03:11:05.462]  The walls are closing in.
[03:11:05.522 --> 03:11:06.662]  The walls closing in.
[03:11:06.682 --> 03:11:07.722]  The walls closing in.
[03:11:07.762 --> 03:11:14.964]  For two years solid, they breathlessly told us that the President had conspired with a hostile nation to steal an election.
[03:11:14.984 --> 03:11:15.264]  Prussia.
[03:11:15.444 --> 03:11:15.764]  Russia.
[03:11:15.784 --> 03:11:15.884]  Putin.
[03:11:15.904 --> 03:11:16.024]  Russia.
[03:11:16.064 --> 03:11:16.184]  Russia.
[03:11:16.204 --> 03:11:16.364]  Russia.
[03:11:16.404 --> 03:11:16.564]  Russia.
[03:11:16.584 --> 03:11:16.704]  Russia.
[03:11:16.765 --> 03:11:17.025]  Russia.
[03:11:17.045 --> 03:11:17.225]  Russia.
[03:11:17.245 --> 03:11:17.425]  Russia.
[03:11:17.445 --> 03:11:17.565]  Russia.
[03:11:17.665 --> 03:11:17.965]  Russia.
[03:11:17.985 --> 03:11:18.245]  Russia.

[03:11:36.352 --> 03:11:36.472]  Russia.

[03:11:37.532 --> 03:11:37.652]  Russia.
[03:11:37.712 --> 03:11:37.872]  Russia.
[03:11:37.892 --> 03:11:38.012]  Russia.
[03:11:38.052 --> 03:11:38.292]  Russia.
[03:11:38.332 --> 03:11:38.533]  Russia.
[03:11:38.593 --> 03:11:38.793]  Russia.

[03:11:39.633 --> 03:11:39.753]  Russia.
[03:11:39.873 --> 03:11:40.253]  Russians.
[03:11:40.414 --> 03:11:40.714]  Russians.
[03:11:40.794 --> 03:11:41.795]  Russia against the US.
[03:11:41.935 --> 03:11:42.395]  The Russians.
[03:11:42.435 --> 03:11:42.575]  Russia.

[03:11:43.716 --> 03:11:44.677]  Russian government scheme.
[03:11:44.717 --> 03:11:45.258]  The Russians.
[03:11:45.438 --> 03:11:46.038]  Vladimir Putin.
[03:11:46.078 --> 03:11:46.379]  Russia.
[03:11:46.439 --> 03:11:47.259]  Vladimir Putin.
[03:11:47.319 --> 03:11:47.480]  Russia.
[03:11:47.500 --> 03:11:47.780]  Putin.
[03:11:47.960 --> 03:11:48.741]  Putin and Russia.
[03:11:48.861 --> 03:11:49.141]  Russia.
[03:11:49.181 --> 03:11:49.581]  Moscow.
[03:11:49.822 --> 03:11:50.102]  Russia.
[03:11:50.242 --> 03:11:50.502]  Russian.
[03:11:50.542 --> 03:11:50.862]  Russia.
[03:11:50.902 --> 03:11:51.163]  Russia.
[03:11:51.363 --> 03:11:51.803]  The Russians.
[03:11:52.123 --> 03:11:52.624]  Russians.
[03:11:52.704 --> 03:11:53.084]  Russians.
[03:11:53.184 --> 03:11:53.505]  Russia.
[03:11:53.565 --> 03:11:53.805]  Russia.
[03:11:53.865 --> 03:11:54.165]  Russian.
[03:11:54.225 --> 03:11:54.486]  Russian.
[03:11:54.646 --> 03:11:55.026]  Russia.
[03:11:55.126 --> 03:11:55.386]  Russia.
[03:11:55.446 --> 03:11:55.787]  Putin.
[03:11:55.847 --> 03:11:56.167]  Putin.
[03:11:56.187 --> 03:11:56.447]  Putin.
[03:11:56.487 --> 03:11:56.787]  Putin.
[03:11:56.807 --> 03:11:57.088]  Putin.
[03:11:57.128 --> 03:11:57.348]  Russia.
[03:11:57.388 --> 03:11:57.708]  Russian.
[03:11:57.788 --> 03:11:58.229]  Russian.
[03:11:58.289 --> 03:11:58.509]  Russia.
[03:11:58.609 --> 03:12:03.912]  And exactly as I said over two years ago, it all turned out to be complete bonk.
[03:12:03.932 --> 03:12:15.799]  40 FBI agents, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 witnesses, 500 search warrants, 230 communications records, 50 phone taps, 13 foreign government intel requests.
[03:12:15.939 --> 03:12:17.340]  No collusion.
[03:12:17.620 --> 03:12:19.501]  No evidence of obstruction.
[03:12:19.541 --> 03:12:20.822]  The media lied to you.
[03:12:21.162 --> 03:12:22.883]  Again and again and again.
[03:12:23.263 --> 03:12:32.488]  They peddled the biggest fake news hoax in a generation, while pointing their fingers at people like me, demanding we be silenced for fake news.
[03:12:32.608 --> 03:12:40.152]  The people screaming about Trump working for Russia are the same people demanding social media censor misinformation.
[03:12:40.332 --> 03:12:40.652]  Stop.
[03:12:41.112 --> 03:12:42.713]  Listening to these people.
[03:12:42.853 --> 03:12:58.466]  If you're an MSNBC viewer or reader of liberal sites on the internet, you were fed a steady stream of conspiratorial bullshit that completely warped your view of the world, all while they purposely excluded anyone who questioned their fraud and profited off of your fears.
[03:12:58.666 --> 03:13:10.457]  Many of them are so delusional that even after the Mueller Report completely debunked their conspiracy theory, even after being totally humiliated, they're still claiming there was Russian collusion.
[03:13:10.597 --> 03:13:15.942]  I'm not owned, I'm not owned, I continue to insist as I slowly shrink and transform into a corncob.
[03:13:16.082 --> 03:13:20.447]  Russian collusion conspiracy theorists are the flat earthers of politics.
[03:13:20.527 --> 03:13:23.830]  They won't apologize, they won't reflect on their hysteria.
[03:13:24.170 --> 03:13:26.592]  Their hysteria will only be elevated.
[03:13:26.712 --> 03:13:27.773]  No one will be fired.
[03:13:28.073 --> 03:13:29.314]  No one will be disciplined.
[03:13:29.474 --> 03:13:33.698]  Are you ever going to have a single moment of self-awareness?
[03:13:33.918 --> 03:13:37.260]  Are you ever going to stop being partisan hacks?
[03:13:37.461 --> 03:13:40.543]  Are you ever going to realise the reason you lost the election?
[03:13:40.683 --> 03:13:43.646]  It wasn't Russian Facebook ads or Twitter bots.
[03:13:43.866 --> 03:13:52.774]  It was because you fielded an unpopular candidate who embodied a neoliberal elitist agenda that the entire world is now rejecting.
[03:13:52.914 --> 03:13:58.259]  And after having spent the last two years hyping the importance and credibility of the Mueller Report,
[03:13:58.339 --> 03:14:02.220]  They're now telling everyone to disregard the Mueller report.
[03:14:02.240 --> 03:14:03.761]  I don't care what's in that report.
[03:14:03.801 --> 03:14:05.661]  This is like Brexit all over again.
[03:14:05.721 --> 03:14:06.342]  What do you want to do?
[03:14:06.422 --> 03:14:10.883]  Keep having investigation after investigation until you get the result you want?
[03:14:11.003 --> 03:14:16.625]  The only way the conspiracy theory can survive is by metastasizing into an even bigger conspiracy.
[03:14:16.705 --> 03:14:19.426]  Now Mueller himself was part of the conspiracy.
[03:14:19.506 --> 03:14:20.206]  Hey, Democrats.
[03:14:20.586 --> 03:14:22.827]  Maybe now drop the conspiracy theories.
[03:14:23.027 --> 03:14:26.629]  Maybe drop demonising half of the American population.
[03:14:26.689 --> 03:14:32.632]  Maybe drop the relentless, frothing hysteria and the endless contrived moral panics.
[03:14:32.833 --> 03:14:40.076]  Maybe now, oh I don't know, become an actual political party with policies that actually resonate with the American people.
[03:14:40.177 --> 03:14:41.157]  Just an idea.
[03:14:41.177 --> 03:14:48.461]  Hey media, instead of abusing your platforms to silence your competition and destabilise democracy, maybe go back.
[03:14:49.121 --> 03:14:58.885]  Alright, that's Editor-at-Large for Infowars.com, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:14:58.905 --> 03:15:01.165]  Will Johnson's taking over the next segment, but let me show you this.
[03:15:01.986 --> 03:15:02.946]  Boston Herald!
[03:15:03.386 --> 03:15:06.127]  Time to ban the collusion conspiracy theorist!
[03:15:07.007 --> 03:15:11.489]  And they go on to say the Democrats should all be banned off Twitter, Facebook,
[03:15:12.881 --> 03:15:17.042]  Google, because Alex Jones was for misinformation.
[03:15:17.562 --> 03:15:19.302]  No, I was for questioning real things.
[03:15:19.742 --> 03:15:21.803]  And they shouldn't get banned for questioning.
[03:15:22.543 --> 03:15:28.864]  They should get arrested for creating the fake investigation and trying to plant evidence, which has now come out.
[03:15:28.904 --> 03:15:29.944]  We have the text messages.
[03:15:30.204 --> 03:15:30.804]  We have the proof.
[03:15:31.285 --> 03:15:36.746]  That's how they get prosecuted, trying to bring the president down in an orchestrated coup, an inside job.
[03:15:36.766 --> 03:15:37.526]  What did Trump call it?
[03:15:37.766 --> 03:15:38.306]  A takedown.
[03:15:39.332 --> 03:15:45.157]  They can sit up there and say the moon's made of cheese and Trump's an Easter Bunny or a Russian agent that wears fur caps.
[03:15:45.717 --> 03:15:50.842]  That's their right to do, but they can't collude with the government to try to overturn the election knowing it's a fraud.
[03:15:51.882 --> 03:15:56.086]  So now they're using the left's censorship of me to call for the left to be censored.
[03:15:56.346 --> 03:15:57.987]  No, let's not turn into them!
[03:15:58.588 --> 03:15:59.529]  Will Johnson coming up.
[03:16:02.307 --> 03:16:08.070]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.
[03:16:08.210 --> 03:16:11.111]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.

[03:17:03.024 --> 03:17:04.384]  I've got some really good news, though.
[03:17:05.533 --> 03:17:06.194]  X2's back.
[03:17:06.894 --> 03:17:08.156]  The original X2.
[03:17:08.656 --> 03:17:11.459]  Deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[03:17:11.579 --> 03:17:12.240]  What you want.
[03:17:12.660 --> 03:17:13.741]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:17:13.781 --> 03:17:14.722]  It'll be here in a week.
[03:17:15.202 --> 03:17:16.343]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[03:17:16.764 --> 03:17:17.705]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:17:17.745 --> 03:17:19.086]  With the best iodine in the world.
[03:17:19.546 --> 03:17:20.287]  X2, it's available.
[03:17:20.688 --> 03:17:21.648]  I thought X3's great.
[03:17:21.668 --> 03:17:23.490]  We still got another deep-earth crystal source.
[03:17:23.871 --> 03:17:25.652]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[03:17:25.692 --> 03:17:26.593]  The scientists that do that.
[03:17:27.054 --> 03:17:28.855]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[03:17:29.676 --> 03:17:33.777]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[03:17:34.057 --> 03:17:37.578]  We now have X2 again, and in fullwarestore.com, so hallelujah!
[03:17:38.138 --> 03:17:49.820]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:58.442]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,

[03:19:01.602 --> 03:19:04.804]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:19:04.884 --> 03:19:05.204]  Go ahead.
[03:19:05.883 --> 03:19:07.685]  I just have to say something, man.
[03:19:07.705 --> 03:19:10.788]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:19:11.589 --> 03:19:12.710]  It just gets old, man.
[03:19:13.010 --> 03:19:14.251]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[03:19:15.432 --> 03:19:17.514]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:19:17.754 --> 03:19:21.738]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:19:21.758 --> 03:19:23.039]  Do you understand?
[03:19:23.059 --> 03:19:24.200]  I'm ringing the alarm.
[03:19:25.061 --> 03:19:27.382]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:19:27.742 --> 03:19:28.803]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[03:19:29.103 --> 03:19:29.983]  Us being shut down?
[03:19:30.223 --> 03:19:31.284]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:19:31.684 --> 03:19:32.724]  You know what, Alex?
[03:19:32.764 --> 03:19:33.845]  Put him on pause again.
[03:19:33.865 --> 03:19:34.705]  Hey, Frank!
[03:19:34.985 --> 03:19:40.327]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:19:40.627 --> 03:19:44.909]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:19:45.149 --> 03:19:48.030]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:19:48.290 --> 03:19:48.671]  You understand?
[03:19:48.751 --> 03:19:50.031]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:19:50.391 --> 03:19:51.512]  I need your help, Frank!

[03:19:58.338 --> 03:19:59.099]  Do you understand?

[03:20:06.207 --> 03:20:08.830]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:26.322 --> 03:20:26.822]  Welcome.
[03:20:26.922 --> 03:20:27.282]  Welcome.
[03:20:27.382 --> 03:20:29.463]  You are watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:29.663 --> 03:20:30.923]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:20:30.943 --> 03:20:34.624]  I will be standing in for Alex Jones for the rest of the show.
[03:20:35.384 --> 03:20:36.424]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:20:36.684 --> 03:20:37.865]  Thank you for staying with us.
[03:20:37.905 --> 03:20:40.185]  There's a lot happening in the news.
[03:20:40.685 --> 03:20:42.866]  I'm pretty sure everyone is aware of the Mueller report.
[03:20:42.906 --> 03:20:44.986]  Of course, Alex Jones was just talking about it.
[03:20:45.566 --> 03:20:48.947]  Awesome report from Paul Watson.
[03:20:49.647 --> 03:20:51.668]  And there's so much going on.
[03:20:51.688 --> 03:20:53.708]  It's almost like I don't know where to start.
[03:20:54.508 --> 03:20:57.851]  But where I'm going to start is with Ilhan Omar.
[03:20:58.272 --> 03:21:00.694]  Just this past weekend, I was in L.A.
[03:21:01.214 --> 03:21:04.657]  where she was speaking at a CARE event.
[03:21:05.458 --> 03:21:18.190]  And at this CARE event, we had roughly over a thousand people that are Americans that were there protesting against CARE for hosting this event with Ilhan Omar.
[03:21:18.872 --> 03:21:25.235]  Ilhan Omar, she's the one that has the whole anti-Semitic statement against Israel.
[03:21:25.935 --> 03:21:34.820]  And it's already been proven that Ilhan Omar and CARE absolutely work together with Hamas as a terrorist organization.
[03:21:35.800 --> 03:21:42.363]  It's kind of remarkable to me that we have a terrorist organization that's operating with inside of the borders of the United States.
[03:21:42.983 --> 03:21:44.144]  And it's not even a secret.
[03:21:44.895 --> 03:21:52.924]  But because of the Democratic Party policies, they've embraced and endorsed this whole anti-Semitic.
[03:21:53.445 --> 03:21:58.210]  They came out with a whole resolution trying to make it look like that they're not hateful towards Jewish people.
[03:21:58.571 --> 03:22:01.434]  Even our president, Donald J. Trump, came out with a statement talking about
[03:22:02.674 --> 03:22:08.696]  How the Democratic Party does not like the Jewish community, which is a true statement.
[03:22:09.216 --> 03:22:11.017]  They've demonstrated it multiple times.
[03:22:11.157 --> 03:22:16.358]  Even when President Trump moved the embassy to Jerusalem, the Democrats were not happy about it.
[03:22:17.078 --> 03:22:25.001]  Every time President Trump put in policies trying to protect the American people against Muslims that want to come destroy the country.
[03:22:25.121 --> 03:22:26.301]  And not all Muslims are bad.
[03:22:26.401 --> 03:22:28.722]  President Trump has already admitted that.
[03:22:29.474 --> 03:22:34.536]  But they get upset every time President Trump tried to do something that's going to protect the American people.
[03:22:35.516 --> 03:22:37.777]  Because of this, we are where we are.
[03:22:37.797 --> 03:22:39.557]  I was in L.A.
[03:22:39.577 --> 03:22:46.680]  this past weekend, and like I said, there was over a thousand people protesting against Ilhan Omar.
[03:22:46.880 --> 03:22:56.003]  And she came out with a statement, and I'm going to play this video clip for you, how about the American people standing outside, protesting against her.
[03:22:57.172 --> 03:23:02.233]  And her statement is completely bonkers, if you ask me.
[03:23:02.913 --> 03:23:16.855]  So without me continuing going on, bumbling, rumbling on, I'm going to show you this clip with Ilhan Omar and how she's addressing us, the American people, outside of this CARE event.
[03:23:16.875 --> 03:23:18.956]  So I'm going to put this on the screen for you.
[03:23:19.776 --> 03:23:20.676]  And you can see it here.
[03:23:20.896 --> 03:23:22.636]  So just listen to what she says here.
[03:23:23.397 --> 03:23:26.057]  There are very fascinating people outside.
[03:23:28.675 --> 03:23:34.038]  Who for so many years have spoken about an Islam that is oppressive.
[03:23:36.280 --> 03:23:41.603]  An Islam that lessens and isolates its women.
[03:23:43.204 --> 03:23:49.728]  And today they gather outside to protest a Muslim woman who is in Congress!
[03:23:54.111 --> 03:23:57.573]  And in the irony, the irony in that
[03:23:58.499 --> 03:23:59.099]  The irony.
[03:23:59.300 --> 03:24:00.921]  It's very entertaining to me.
[03:24:00.941 --> 03:24:14.670]  I know, I know many of them drove miles to get here, spent a lot of energy and resources and money to purchase the signs that they have.
[03:24:15.850 --> 03:24:25.957]  But I don't think any of them realize that people like myself and many of the people in this room can care less about what they have to say
[03:24:27.799 --> 03:24:28.119]  Really?
[03:24:28.680 --> 03:24:28.940]  Really?
[03:24:29.620 --> 03:24:30.481]  She care less?
[03:24:30.801 --> 03:24:35.704]  Her and the people in the room care less what Americans have to say?
[03:24:37.425 --> 03:24:38.006]  Did you hear?
[03:24:38.386 --> 03:24:39.066]  She just said it.
[03:24:39.226 --> 03:24:40.707]  I'm not putting words in her mouth.
[03:24:41.148 --> 03:24:43.149]  She straight up said that she could care less.
[03:24:43.229 --> 03:24:47.972]  Her and the people in the room could care less on what Americans have to say.
[03:24:49.893 --> 03:24:57.038]  And if we're supposed to believe what she's saying as truth, that we should care less what Americans have to say?
[03:24:58.314 --> 03:25:04.160]  That should send a signal to everybody in this country that they do not care about America.
[03:25:05.281 --> 03:25:08.524]  Now, the people that were standing out there, they're not there for Islam.
[03:25:09.145 --> 03:25:14.330]  They didn't come to the protest, this whole rally, because they want to show their support for Islam.
[03:25:14.610 --> 03:25:16.432]  They're speaking out against Islam.
[03:25:16.732 --> 03:25:21.657]  And then she says she finds it ironic that she's Muslim and she's in Congress.
[03:25:23.286 --> 03:25:31.968]  Now, to my understanding, unless it has changed, you have to be an American citizen in order to be a member of Congress.
[03:25:32.708 --> 03:25:41.950]  So, her being an American citizen, and now she's a member of Congress, is the only reason why she is a Congresswoman.
[03:25:42.591 --> 03:25:43.991]  See, she left that part out.
[03:25:44.511 --> 03:25:48.432]  Now, if she was in the Middle East, would she have the same rights?
[03:25:49.119 --> 03:25:55.681]  Would she be able to stand before the men that was at this event and speak to them with authority?
[03:25:56.921 --> 03:25:57.722]  Think about that.
[03:25:58.282 --> 03:26:00.362]  See, that's the part that she's leaving out.
[03:26:00.883 --> 03:26:02.223]  Of course, you're a woman.
[03:26:02.263 --> 03:26:03.163]  You're in America.
[03:26:03.423 --> 03:26:04.224]  You have rights.
[03:26:04.244 --> 03:26:07.004]  You have every means necessary.
[03:26:07.205 --> 03:26:09.605]  You have every ability to become somebody.
[03:26:09.645 --> 03:26:12.546]  You have every right to become a Congresswoman.
[03:26:13.606 --> 03:26:14.987]  That's what America is about.
[03:26:16.391 --> 03:26:20.592]  It's not the Republicans, it's not the American people that want to keep women suppressed.
[03:26:20.832 --> 03:26:21.853]  It is Islam.
[03:26:22.113 --> 03:26:27.134]  If you went over to the Middle East, she would not be in the position she's in right now.
[03:26:27.774 --> 03:26:30.315]  The only reason why she's there, because she's where?
[03:26:30.775 --> 03:26:31.615]  In America.
[03:26:31.815 --> 03:26:34.196]  The United States of America.
[03:26:34.656 --> 03:26:35.656]  That's the only reason.
[03:26:36.677 --> 03:26:38.037]  It's really a no-brainer.
[03:26:39.292 --> 03:26:44.535]  And see, the people in there, they're not hearing that, so they're only going based on what she's saying.
[03:26:44.795 --> 03:26:54.579]  The whole objective here is to convince the American people that Islam is for women, which we all know is not.
[03:26:56.200 --> 03:26:58.942]  Would she be willing to take the hijab off?
[03:26:59.262 --> 03:27:01.943]  Would she be willing to take the thing off her head off?
[03:27:02.663 --> 03:27:03.604]  Why not show her hair?
[03:27:03.864 --> 03:27:07.746]  And has she been presented with the question about Israel
[03:27:08.655 --> 03:27:11.516]  Having their freedom, Israel being a state.
[03:27:13.016 --> 03:27:16.677]  She's come out multiple times with her hatred toward Israel.
[03:27:17.878 --> 03:27:23.459]  And can you imagine how she feels with President Trump showing his support for Israel?
[03:27:23.839 --> 03:27:33.362]  Never before in the history of this nation, we've had other presidents in the past saying that they're going to do X, Y, Z for Israel and does nothing.
[03:27:34.822 --> 03:27:35.942]  Zero, not a zip.
[03:27:36.322 --> 03:27:38.063]  But here it is, President Trump.
[03:27:38.675 --> 03:27:39.996]  Keeping his word.
[03:27:41.277 --> 03:27:42.597]  That is the major problem.
[03:27:43.758 --> 03:27:46.019]  That is the major problem when it comes to the Democrats.
[03:27:46.760 --> 03:27:49.402]  You have a President of the United States keeping his word.
[03:27:50.382 --> 03:27:51.223]  And they don't like it.
[03:27:52.724 --> 03:27:56.686]  Just to give you a really quick brief, you have the Central for Security Policy.
[03:27:57.827 --> 03:28:03.310]  They even came out with a statement showing how CARE is a domestic terrorist group.
[03:28:04.511 --> 03:28:05.351]  They laid out the proof.
[03:28:05.391 --> 03:28:06.752]  There's documentation on it.
[03:28:07.924 --> 03:28:10.225]  They've already lined it out for all of us to see.
[03:28:13.046 --> 03:28:14.506]  What more do you need to see?
[03:28:14.727 --> 03:28:16.327]  What more evidence do you need to see?
[03:28:16.627 --> 03:28:17.428]  It is all there.
[03:28:17.868 --> 03:28:21.729]  She just plainly laid it out that she's not here for the American people.
[03:28:22.069 --> 03:28:23.370]  She's here for Islam.
[03:28:24.210 --> 03:28:28.472]  For her, the Sharia comes above all other things.
[03:28:29.512 --> 03:28:30.913]  Sharia is the one.
[03:28:31.213 --> 03:28:32.813]  Sharia is the only one for them.
[03:28:33.994 --> 03:28:35.694]  OK, so we're going to go to a break here.
[03:28:35.754 --> 03:28:37.175]  But before we go, I want to say this.
[03:28:37.865 --> 03:28:39.266]  InfoWars.com.
[03:28:39.846 --> 03:28:42.527]  Go to InfoWars.com and check out the supplements.
[03:28:42.567 --> 03:28:43.808]  They have beautiful things.
[03:28:45.168 --> 03:28:46.269]  You can get everything.
[03:28:46.349 --> 03:28:50.850]  The Brain Force, the Turbo Force, the Protein Bars.
[03:28:51.251 --> 03:28:53.211]  I actually have some of the Protein Bars.
[03:28:53.752 --> 03:28:54.992]  They are fulfilling.
[03:28:55.252 --> 03:28:57.293]  My name is Will Johnson, The Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:57.353 --> 03:28:59.094]  We'll be right back after this short break.
[03:29:02.946 --> 03:29:07.910]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[03:29:08.130 --> 03:29:15.696]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:29:16.717 --> 03:29:19.279]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:29:19.699 --> 03:29:21.040]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:29:21.420 --> 03:29:27.705]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[03:29:29.787 --> 03:29:34.690]  The Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.
[03:29:35.110 --> 03:29:38.032]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:29:38.072 --> 03:29:41.654]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:29:41.674 --> 03:29:45.556]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:29:45.976 --> 03:29:47.677]  I've got two in my home.
[03:29:47.797 --> 03:29:53.420]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:29:53.900 --> 03:29:54.741]  Don't live
[03:29:55.581 --> 03:29:59.271]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[03:29:59.632 --> 03:30:00.895]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:03.530 --> 03:30:12.378]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[03:30:13.219 --> 03:30:19.104]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[03:30:19.684 --> 03:30:20.705]  Then they set the precedent.
[03:30:21.186 --> 03:30:25.329]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[03:30:26.050 --> 03:30:27.451]  They take you off the internet.
[03:30:27.511 --> 03:30:37.440]  Now, Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[03:30:38.320 --> 03:30:43.665]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist
[03:30:44.065 --> 03:30:45.525]  Here's to the crazy ones.
[03:30:45.545 --> 03:30:45.965]  The misfits.
[03:30:45.985 --> 03:30:46.585]  The rebels.
[03:31:11.235 --> 03:31:11.875]  Troublemakers.
[03:31:13.117 --> 03:31:14.819]  The round pegs in the square holes.
[03:31:15.139 --> 03:31:19.484]  The ones who see things differently.
[03:31:19.524 --> 03:31:23.709]  They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo.
[03:31:25.350 --> 03:31:30.076]  You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
[03:31:30.962 --> 03:31:33.764]  About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.
[03:31:35.225 --> 03:31:40.309]  And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
[03:31:41.970 --> 03:31:48.815]  Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.
[03:32:02.895 --> 03:32:09.337]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[03:32:10.697 --> 03:32:13.517]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[03:32:14.018 --> 03:32:16.598]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[03:32:17.118 --> 03:32:18.319]  I didn't invent all this.
[03:32:18.679 --> 03:32:24.700]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[03:32:25.240 --> 03:32:28.041]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[03:32:29.110 --> 03:32:32.151]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[03:32:32.451 --> 03:32:36.613]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[03:32:37.073 --> 03:32:50.339]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[03:32:50.619 --> 03:32:52.540]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[03:32:53.200 --> 03:32:58.023]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[03:32:58.443 --> 03:33:00.964]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[03:33:06.147 --> 03:33:08.789]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.676 --> 03:33:26.257]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.317 --> 03:33:27.538]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:33:27.898 --> 03:33:31.539]  I am hosting this last hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.480 --> 03:33:35.081]  Thank you for coming back and staying with us.
[03:33:35.921 --> 03:33:41.143]  The last segment I was talking about Ilhan Omar and the event that she had in L.A.
[03:33:41.183 --> 03:33:42.164]  this past weekend.
[03:33:42.764 --> 03:33:50.007]  And one of the things that I want to show you was, and I actually I'm going to put up on the screen here, this was the security
[03:33:51.340 --> 03:33:54.541]  This was the Central for Security Policy.
[03:33:54.902 --> 03:33:57.963]  And on their website, they show that, you know, CAR is Hamas.
[03:33:58.483 --> 03:34:04.065]  And they actually have the documentation where they prove that they are a terrorist group.
[03:34:04.186 --> 03:34:05.966]  And I'm not going to go through everything on here.
[03:34:06.426 --> 03:34:16.671]  But one of the things that people should realize is that even the founder of this CAR organization, they even came out with a statement talking about how
[03:34:17.805 --> 03:34:20.946]  They said they believe, and I'm going to read this word for word.
[03:34:21.367 --> 03:34:30.410]  Now, I quote, he says, it is important to mislead Americans about the future and the nature of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[03:34:31.511 --> 03:34:37.573]  It is support and it supports the terrorist acts against Israel.
[03:34:38.074 --> 03:34:39.794]  So they don't want people to realize that.
[03:34:39.834 --> 03:34:41.055]  They don't want people to know that.
[03:34:41.658 --> 03:34:43.959]  That's the part that's really amazing about all this.
[03:34:43.999 --> 03:34:45.379]  The documentation is out there.
[03:34:45.840 --> 03:34:47.020]  They're no longer hiding it.
[03:34:47.420 --> 03:34:50.341]  It's in plain sight, and the Democrats are actually embracing it.
[03:34:50.761 --> 03:34:52.602]  That's the scary part about all of this.
[03:34:53.222 --> 03:35:00.445]  So, but the main topic today, the main story that's buzzing around, well, actually, there should be two main topics buzzing around.
[03:35:00.685 --> 03:35:03.086]  And I'm gonna get to that second topic here in just a minute.
[03:35:04.001 --> 03:35:14.203]  But the main one that everyone is talking about, all the mainstream news media, the outlets, Infowars, Breitbart, Judge Report, all of them is the Russia no collusion.
[03:35:15.023 --> 03:35:17.003]  It should just be called that, Russia no collusion.
[03:35:17.824 --> 03:35:26.985]  You know, the Democrats for the last two years have been attacking the president day in and day out, as long as they can, to get at the president.
[03:35:28.265 --> 03:35:31.586]  Never in the history of this world, or this country rather,
[03:35:32.344 --> 03:35:41.468]  Have the Democrats, the mainstream media, even some Republicans, have done everything they could to take out the President of the United States.
[03:35:43.329 --> 03:35:52.714]  So this whole Russia collusion has been more than $25 million dollars, our dollars, spent.
[03:35:53.434 --> 03:35:56.856]  Now everyone who hears that should be highly upset.
[03:35:57.936 --> 03:35:59.117]  Do we get a refund?
[03:35:59.897 --> 03:36:01.278]  Does that money come back to us?
[03:36:02.193 --> 03:36:02.793]  I think not.
[03:36:03.053 --> 03:36:04.054]  It's just money gone.
[03:36:05.254 --> 03:36:06.555]  I mean, they spent this money.
[03:36:07.255 --> 03:36:08.935]  I mean, where are the checks and balances at?
[03:36:09.656 --> 03:36:10.876]  I mean, President Trump came out.
[03:36:10.956 --> 03:36:12.497]  It's a total witch hunt.
[03:36:14.337 --> 03:36:18.098]  And everybody's talking about it, and everyone should pay attention to what's happening here.
[03:36:19.599 --> 03:36:21.359]  It's completely despicable.
[03:36:21.379 --> 03:36:24.280]  2,800 subpoenas.
[03:36:25.121 --> 03:36:26.881]  No collusion, mind you.
[03:36:27.702 --> 03:36:28.522]  After the 2,800 subpoenas, 2,800.
[03:36:33.021 --> 03:36:35.021]  Think about that number, 2,800 subpoenas.
[03:36:35.081 --> 03:36:41.583]  Imagine the man hours it took for 2,800 subpoenas with no collusion.
[03:36:43.823 --> 03:36:45.544]  500 witnesses?
[03:36:46.644 --> 03:36:46.964]  Really?
[03:36:48.404 --> 03:36:51.205]  500 witnesses and where's the collusion?
[03:36:51.505 --> 03:36:55.426]  There is still no collusion after 500 witnesses.
[03:36:55.846 --> 03:36:58.126]  And you know what's really amazing about all of it?
[03:36:59.547 --> 03:37:01.327]  Is that with shifty shift,
[03:37:03.158 --> 03:37:08.720]  Knowing that there's no collusion after the report coming out, Shifty Shift is upset.
[03:37:09.740 --> 03:37:11.240]  The Democrat Party's upset.
[03:37:11.940 --> 03:37:18.502]  The liberal media is upset that there is no collusion.
[03:37:18.982 --> 03:37:21.103]  So now they're going with obstruction.
[03:37:21.989 --> 03:37:25.210]  See, they have been talking about obstruction before the report came out.
[03:37:25.430 --> 03:37:32.871]  And the main reason I believe that they've been talking about obstruction before the report came out, because they knew for a fact there was no Russia collusion.
[03:37:34.171 --> 03:37:34.711]  They knew it.
[03:37:36.132 --> 03:37:37.112]  It was already spelled out.
[03:37:37.252 --> 03:37:41.512]  Don't forget about Nancy Pelosi talking about, well, you know what, we need to move on.
[03:37:42.473 --> 03:37:43.053]  How long ago?
[03:37:43.113 --> 03:37:44.253]  She just did that recently.
[03:37:44.873 --> 03:37:46.193]  A lot of people don't even know that.
[03:37:46.713 --> 03:37:48.194]  A lot of people don't even realize that.
[03:37:49.094 --> 03:37:49.834]  She just admitted.
[03:37:50.413 --> 03:37:53.695]  So now they're going with the whole obstruction of justice.
[03:37:54.175 --> 03:37:59.839]  Why in the world would President Trump have to do obstruction when he did nothing wrong?
[03:38:00.799 --> 03:38:01.499]  Think about that.
[03:38:02.380 --> 03:38:19.530]  You know, if someone says that, hey, you just stole that car and you got the license and registration to the vehicle, and if you don't show someone who's just making up these lies your license and registration, they're saying that you're obstructing.
[03:38:20.962 --> 03:38:32.611]  And then if they get a subpoena and they do all this stuff, they do this report, they go down to the DMV and they find out that you actually own the vehicle, they're going to say that you were obstructing because you didn't want to show them your license and registration.
[03:38:33.792 --> 03:38:35.073]  I'm not talking about a police officer.
[03:38:35.253 --> 03:38:37.334]  I'm talking about someone who's made up this whole thing.
[03:38:37.995 --> 03:38:39.376]  That's exactly what this is.
[03:38:40.437 --> 03:38:41.257]  Oh, you're obstructing.
[03:38:41.557 --> 03:38:44.740]  So now they don't have any collusion with Russia.
[03:38:45.828 --> 03:38:47.449]  So let's make, let's go with Russia.
[03:38:47.990 --> 03:38:49.111]  Let's say that he obstructed.
[03:38:49.311 --> 03:38:50.252]  It's the witch hunt.
[03:38:50.612 --> 03:38:52.333]  They're not going to stop the witch hunt.
[03:38:53.354 --> 03:38:55.376]  This whole witch hunt is going to continue.
[03:38:55.396 --> 03:38:56.517]  It's not going to stop.
[03:38:58.999 --> 03:39:00.340]  They are completely upset by it.
[03:39:01.101 --> 03:39:07.286]  So I have a short clip that I want to play of Shifty Shift after he found out, and this is from Sunday.
[03:39:07.955 --> 03:39:16.760]  With Shifty Schiff complaining about his whole thing about Russia collusion and how they're not going to stop because they're moving on to obstruction now.
[03:39:17.480 --> 03:39:26.465]  And I don't know if you recall a while back where Shifty Schiff said that, well, if they come out and they find out in the report, basically, I'm paraphrasing here.
[03:39:26.705 --> 03:39:29.806]  They come out and they find out that there was no collusion.
[03:39:30.407 --> 03:39:32.188]  We're going to have our own investigation.
[03:39:32.648 --> 03:39:34.789]  So basically this is how you put it.
[03:39:35.771 --> 03:39:42.634]  Basically, you have this whole Russia collusion is dead, is done, in the casket, buried, funeral.
[03:39:43.874 --> 03:39:50.537]  The Democrats and Shifty Shift and the rest of them, even the liberal media, they're going to dig up that casket and have their own funeral.
[03:39:51.138 --> 03:40:01.322]  They're going to dig up those bones and look at the same bones that everyone's been looking at for the last two years and say, try to come up with something else different about this dead body that's in this casket.
[03:40:02.466 --> 03:40:03.708]  And have their own funeral.
[03:40:03.928 --> 03:40:05.550]  That's the insanity of all of this.
[03:40:05.890 --> 03:40:07.292]  So let me put this clip up here.
[03:40:07.572 --> 03:40:09.715]  This is with our Shifty Shifts.
[03:40:09.835 --> 03:40:11.136]  Congressman Shifty Shifts.
[03:40:11.697 --> 03:40:12.278]  Check this out.
[03:40:15.346 --> 03:40:24.413]  You know, the biggest news from Robert Mueller so far is that there are no new indictments for that underlying any cooperation or conspiracy with the Russians to interfere in our elections.
[03:40:24.453 --> 03:40:29.097]  And we're already seeing Rudy Giuliani come out with a tweet yesterday about that, citing you.
[03:40:29.477 --> 03:40:33.400]  He said your previous statement saying there is significant evidence of collusion involving the Trump campaign.
[03:40:33.861 --> 03:40:38.424]  I trust he, Adam Schiff, is relieved there is no collusion, and I hope he will apologize for his mistake.
[03:40:38.444 --> 03:40:39.105]  We all make them.
[03:40:39.425 --> 03:40:40.586]  The real virtue is to admit it.
[03:40:40.646 --> 03:40:41.367]  It would help us heal.
[03:40:41.387 --> 03:40:42.808]  Are you going to apologize?
[03:40:44.261 --> 03:40:50.705]  I think Mr. Giuliani would be wise to wait until the report is made public before making any pronouncements about vindication.
[03:40:51.125 --> 03:40:54.027]  You have said though in the past there is significant evidence of collusion.
[03:40:54.107 --> 03:40:57.949]  How do you square that with Robert Mueller's decision not to indict anyone?
[03:40:59.282 --> 03:41:17.254]  And there is significant evidence of collusion and we've set that out time and time again from the secret meetings in Trump Tower to the conversations between Flynn, the Russian ambassador, to the providing of polling data to someone linked to Russian intelligence and Stone's conversation with WikiLeaks and the GRU through... None of it's prosecuted.
[03:41:19.996 --> 03:41:20.557]  No, that's true.
[03:41:20.577 --> 03:41:23.659]  None of it's prosecuted.
[03:41:23.819 --> 03:41:24.900]  And you go, no, that's true.
[03:41:25.660 --> 03:41:26.461]  There's nothing there.
[03:41:27.501 --> 03:41:28.262]  It's a nothing burger.
[03:41:29.136 --> 03:41:31.658]  They still can't get over the fact that they can't get anything.
[03:41:31.878 --> 03:41:36.741]  They're digging up dead bones, trying to make something out of these dead bones.
[03:41:39.142 --> 03:41:45.746]  Even Lindsey Graham is now talking about how come they didn't investigate the other side.
[03:41:47.808 --> 03:41:48.028]  Right?
[03:41:48.628 --> 03:41:56.213]  I mean, seriously, if you really want to talk about Russia collusion, when you want to look into the fake steel dossier,
[03:41:57.877 --> 03:42:00.458]  Did all of this start with the dossier?
[03:42:01.558 --> 03:42:03.099]  The Pfizer report?
[03:42:03.239 --> 03:42:09.120]  I mean, when they went to the Pfizer court, did they question about this information?
[03:42:09.740 --> 03:42:14.442]  Is that information in the full Mueller report about the dossier?
[03:42:14.462 --> 03:42:16.802]  I mean, what started it?
[03:42:17.502 --> 03:42:22.684]  They were investigating a candidate running for president, someone that was working on the campaign,
[03:42:23.678 --> 03:42:24.539]  And didn't inform him.
[03:42:24.619 --> 03:42:31.363]  Lindsey Graham even brought up the fact how when Dianne Feinstein was saying what she was saying.
[03:42:31.804 --> 03:42:34.686]  And I'm going to talk a little bit more about that on the other side of this break.
[03:42:35.286 --> 03:42:44.512]  Dianne Feinstein even did what she did talking about she had someone working with her with China, but she let him go because the FBI let her know about it.
[03:42:44.552 --> 03:42:46.714]  But they didn't let President Trump know about it.
[03:42:47.434 --> 03:42:49.556]  More on the other side of this break.
[03:42:50.076 --> 03:42:51.197]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:42:51.297 --> 03:42:52.738]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:53.732 --> 03:42:54.372]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:02.917 --> 03:43:05.919]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[03:43:06.279 --> 03:43:12.202]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[03:43:12.622 --> 03:43:18.485]  Research from a World Health Organization study showed that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[03:43:18.806 --> 03:43:21.447]  In fact, over 90 percent of Americans are low in iodine.
[03:43:21.707 --> 03:43:29.231]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[03:43:29.251 --> 03:43:37.435]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[03:43:38.035 --> 03:43:42.297]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[03:43:43.169 --> 03:43:46.771]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[03:43:46.971 --> 03:43:52.934]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[03:43:53.914 --> 03:44:02.779]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[03:44:03.319 --> 03:44:07.501]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[03:44:07.541 --> 03:44:09.262]  You're probably going, wait a minute,
[03:44:10.353 --> 03:44:12.223]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[03:44:12.725 --> 03:44:13.489]  It was the last run.
[03:44:13.509 --> 03:44:14.474]  It's been sold out for two months.
[03:44:15.560 --> 03:44:16.421]  How is X2 back?
[03:44:16.901 --> 03:44:20.504]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[03:44:20.984 --> 03:44:24.066]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get it anymore.
[03:44:24.647 --> 03:44:34.694]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep-earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[03:44:34.754 --> 03:44:38.677]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[03:44:39.117 --> 03:44:40.238]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[03:44:40.658 --> 03:44:44.999]  You need to do research into Iodine and the Iodine Conspiracy for yourself.
[03:44:45.459 --> 03:44:47.280]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[03:44:47.680 --> 03:44:48.980]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[03:44:49.500 --> 03:44:51.761]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[03:44:52.441 --> 03:44:54.581]  Like a 4.9 star on Power Reviews.
[03:44:55.181 --> 03:44:58.702]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[03:44:59.522 --> 03:45:02.003]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[03:45:03.030 --> 03:45:05.352]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[03:45:05.812 --> 03:45:18.180]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[03:45:18.661 --> 03:45:21.202]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[03:45:21.743 --> 03:45:22.883]  So iodine is amazing.
[03:45:22.923 --> 03:45:23.504]  It's important.
[03:45:23.524 --> 03:45:25.765]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[03:45:25.825 --> 03:45:26.346]  They'll hurt you.
[03:45:26.726 --> 03:45:27.406]  This is pure.
[03:45:27.687 --> 03:45:28.387]  This is clean.
[03:45:28.727 --> 03:45:29.528]  This is amazing.
[03:45:29.848 --> 03:45:31.649]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[03:45:33.170 --> 03:45:36.813]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[03:45:37.113 --> 03:45:41.877]  X2 Original from the very first original manufacturer.
[03:45:42.257 --> 03:45:48.662]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:45:48.722 --> 03:45:51.804]  As I said, get your pre-orders in, week, week and a half.
[03:45:52.044 --> 03:46:00.871]  It's being labeled right now, it's already been bottled, and we are going to have it for you, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:46:00.891 --> 03:46:01.892]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:46:02.682 --> 03:46:06.545]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[03:46:07.326 --> 03:46:11.149]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[03:46:11.570 --> 03:46:18.596]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[03:46:19.517 --> 03:46:21.739]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[03:46:22.639 --> 03:46:26.122]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[03:46:27.443 --> 03:46:30.406]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[03:46:30.586 --> 03:46:32.108]  We are the power structure.
[03:46:32.608 --> 03:46:33.649]  We are the inventors.
[03:46:34.230 --> 03:46:35.271]  We are the trailblazers.
[03:46:35.991 --> 03:46:38.834]  And the globalists understand that.
[03:46:39.395 --> 03:46:45.360]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[03:46:46.521 --> 03:46:50.325]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[03:46:51.352 --> 03:47:01.862]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at Inforestore.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[03:47:06.186 --> 03:47:08.789]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.248 --> 03:47:25.609]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:25.809 --> 03:47:26.969]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:47:27.649 --> 03:47:28.769]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:47:28.809 --> 03:47:30.170]  Thank you for staying with us.
[03:47:30.870 --> 03:47:34.791]  Absolutely wonderful things, crazy things happening in the world right now today.
[03:47:36.071 --> 03:47:38.252]  Russia, there's no Russia collusion once again.
[03:47:38.812 --> 03:47:48.034]  The last segment I was talking about how Dianne Feinstein had someone working under her and the FBI informed her and they let that person go.
[03:47:48.863 --> 03:47:51.464]  They did not do the same thing under President Trump.
[03:47:51.644 --> 03:47:55.005]  And Lindsey Graham today made that quite clear in his statement today.
[03:47:55.326 --> 03:48:05.750]  Another thing that he mentioned, I thought it was very important to get it across, is that he said that Americans that hate the fact that President Trump did not collude are upset.
[03:48:06.050 --> 03:48:06.990]  They hate this country.
[03:48:08.151 --> 03:48:12.072]  Why would you be upset if President Trump did not collude?
[03:48:12.612 --> 03:48:12.812]  Right?
[03:48:12.912 --> 03:48:14.053]  They don't even sound right.
[03:48:14.773 --> 03:48:16.614]  But Americans that are happy,
[03:48:17.546 --> 03:48:18.647]  That he did not collude?
[03:48:18.808 --> 03:48:19.889]  They love this country.
[03:48:21.030 --> 03:48:21.691]  Think about that.
[03:48:22.832 --> 03:48:23.573]  It goes both ways.
[03:48:23.653 --> 03:48:25.335]  It's absolutely insanity.
[03:48:26.217 --> 03:48:30.762]  Here it is, showing that the president did not do anything wrong, and they're upset.
[03:48:31.002 --> 03:48:33.205]  It's like they want the president to do something wrong.
[03:48:34.531 --> 03:48:36.172]  We know why they want him to do something wrong.
[03:48:36.212 --> 03:48:39.834]  They want him to do something wrong because they can't stand him doing the right thing for this country.
[03:48:40.154 --> 03:48:42.916]  They can't stand that he's a positive thing for this country.
[03:48:43.336 --> 03:48:44.056]  They just want him out.
[03:48:44.397 --> 03:48:46.978]  They want to impeach him by any means necessary.
[03:48:47.418 --> 03:48:48.219]  Impeach the president.
[03:48:48.279 --> 03:48:49.179]  Impeach the president.
[03:48:49.980 --> 03:48:50.740]  Get rid of him.
[03:48:50.880 --> 03:48:51.460]  Get rid of him.
[03:48:51.521 --> 03:48:52.581]  We don't like him.
[03:48:52.641 --> 03:48:53.482]  We don't like him.
[03:48:55.223 --> 03:48:57.684]  So with President Trump,
[03:48:58.923 --> 03:49:01.604]  Being, you know, basically there's no collusion.
[03:49:02.264 --> 03:49:05.245]  America has the cloud just lifted off of it.
[03:49:05.945 --> 03:49:11.367]  The Democrats still have this thundercloud over them and they're upset because the rest of us see the light.
[03:49:11.887 --> 03:49:13.087]  We're in the sunshine.
[03:49:13.507 --> 03:49:14.728]  The birds are chirping.
[03:49:15.328 --> 03:49:16.728]  The flowers are blooming.
[03:49:17.549 --> 03:49:20.229]  And for some reason, the Democrats can't stand that fact.
[03:49:21.030 --> 03:49:25.691]  This is a sad day in America for them, but it's a great day for America as a whole.
[03:49:26.644 --> 03:49:27.965]  And we all should be celebrating.
[03:49:28.525 --> 03:49:29.606]  Isn't this what we wanted?
[03:49:29.966 --> 03:49:37.510]  I remember two years ago when people were complaining about President Trump saying, wait until the Mueller report comes out, wait until the Mueller report comes out.
[03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:43.673]  Well, the Mueller report comes out and they don't like the fact that there has been no Russia collusion.
[03:49:44.074 --> 03:49:48.436]  The truth of it, the reality of it, there is no Russia collusion.
[03:49:48.976 --> 03:49:54.359]  And we've all seen how the Democrats demonstrate how they like reality in the year 2019.
[03:49:56.118 --> 03:49:58.319]  They argue, they fight with reality.
[03:49:59.180 --> 03:50:01.522]  Two plus two for them no longer equals four.
[03:50:02.282 --> 03:50:04.864]  Then they're trying to convince everybody that it equals five.
[03:50:04.924 --> 03:50:08.046]  And if you say otherwise, then hey, you're going to be attacked.
[03:50:09.247 --> 03:50:11.088]  They want to remove you from social media.
[03:50:11.128 --> 03:50:16.311]  They want to remove you from, you know, various networks because you're speaking your mind.
[03:50:16.331 --> 03:50:17.372]  You're telling the truth.
[03:50:17.912 --> 03:50:19.393]  You can't, we can't have that.
[03:50:20.494 --> 03:50:21.394]  Think about that.
[03:50:22.475 --> 03:50:23.756]  This is the world we live in.
[03:50:24.645 --> 03:50:29.267]  So with Russia collusion going on, with no Russia collusion going on, I want to show you something here.
[03:50:30.147 --> 03:50:35.289]  This is from part of the report from the Attorney General.
[03:50:36.089 --> 03:50:41.271]  And the Attorney General made it clear, and because he made it clear about this, they're upset.
[03:50:42.011 --> 03:50:51.674]  The Democrats are upset because they said he did not take enough time to go through the Mueller report himself, as if he needed more time.
[03:50:52.795 --> 03:50:54.095]  He probably asked Mueller
[03:50:54.995 --> 03:50:59.817]  Did you find anything that proved that there was anything close to Russia collusion?
[03:51:00.658 --> 03:51:05.200]  And Mueller probably told him, more than likely said, no, there was absolutely nothing.
[03:51:05.260 --> 03:51:08.682]  It was zero evidence that showed Russia collusion.
[03:51:09.222 --> 03:51:10.402]  So it made it pretty simple.
[03:51:10.923 --> 03:51:17.566]  This two year, the past two years, $25 million plus later, no Russia collusion.
[03:51:18.566 --> 03:51:19.547]  And what do you expect?
[03:51:20.791 --> 03:51:25.475]  Him to make up something, say, you know what, well, there might be possibly something, but there's no more indictments coming.
[03:51:25.875 --> 03:51:27.076]  So you can't make something up.
[03:51:27.656 --> 03:51:29.558]  So just listen, watch, look at this.
[03:51:30.438 --> 03:51:35.863]  This is part of the report that came from the attorney general.
[03:51:36.583 --> 03:51:40.967]  And it says the special counsel's report is divided into two parts.
[03:51:41.907 --> 03:51:49.093]  The first describes the results of the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S.
[03:51:49.473 --> 03:51:50.474]  presidential election.
[03:51:51.348 --> 03:52:04.091]  The report outlines Russia's efforts to influence the election and documents crimes committed by persons associated with the Russian government connected with those efforts.
[03:52:05.071 --> 03:52:19.055]  The report further explains that the primary consideration for the special counsel's investigation was whether any Americans, including individuals associated with the Trump campaign, joined
[03:52:19.787 --> 03:52:40.978]  The special counsel's investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S.
[03:52:41.018 --> 03:52:41.999]  presidential election.
[03:52:44.032 --> 03:52:56.216]  As the report states, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its interference activities.
[03:52:56.776 --> 03:53:01.818]  So we all can agree that Russia does try to hack America.
[03:53:02.178 --> 03:53:03.798]  America tries to hack Russia.
[03:53:04.299 --> 03:53:06.399]  America tries to hack Israel.
[03:53:06.719 --> 03:53:08.560]  Israel tries to hack America.
[03:53:09.389 --> 03:53:14.891]  Allies hack each other to let each other know about open holes in their firewall.
[03:53:15.611 --> 03:53:16.751]  It's a common practice.
[03:53:17.432 --> 03:53:21.013]  Here in Silicon Valley, where I'm at, it is a common practice.
[03:53:21.393 --> 03:53:27.255]  They hack each other to find different things, and that's one way that allies help each other throughout the world.
[03:53:27.873 --> 03:53:29.454]  Doesn't mean that the enemies don't do it.
[03:53:29.855 --> 03:53:37.441]  And one thing they're talking about saying, you know, even even Lindsey Graham said today that is show proof that Russia hacked the DNC.
[03:53:38.021 --> 03:53:48.129]  And my question to that would be to Lindsey Graham is when the FBI went to the DNC, was the FBI actually able to see the servers that were hacked?
[03:53:48.430 --> 03:53:53.394]  Because the last time I looked, the DNC refused to allow the FBI to view the servers.
[03:53:54.054 --> 03:53:55.175]  It's a valid question.
[03:53:56.056 --> 03:53:57.297]  To me, it's a valid question.
[03:53:57.893 --> 03:53:59.754]  They seem to forget about Seth Rich.
[03:54:00.534 --> 03:54:04.815]  You know, and they said that Roger Stone's connection with WikiLeaks is his connection to Russia.
[03:54:05.135 --> 03:54:06.756]  I mean, seriously?
[03:54:07.256 --> 03:54:08.476]  You can say that about all of us.
[03:54:08.797 --> 03:54:11.157]  My connection to Russia is I'm on the same planet.
[03:54:12.158 --> 03:54:12.998]  I mean, really?
[03:54:13.678 --> 03:54:14.038]  Really?
[03:54:14.058 --> 03:54:17.399]  They make up everything out of everything.
[03:54:18.060 --> 03:54:22.121]  And the left, they're still so butthurt
[03:54:23.010 --> 03:54:25.973]  That President Trump is still the president with no collusion.
[03:54:26.493 --> 03:54:27.754]  They don't know how to handle it.
[03:54:28.334 --> 03:54:30.957]  So I have another quick video that I'm going to share with you.
[03:54:31.157 --> 03:54:36.521]  And this is with our favorite person here in California, Maxine Waters.
[03:54:37.682 --> 03:54:38.863]  She is still losing it.
[03:54:39.003 --> 03:54:40.284]  She's completely losing it.
[03:54:40.685 --> 03:54:42.306]  Let's check this out really quick here.
[03:54:43.018 --> 03:54:45.140]  Maxine Waters, our favorite person.
[03:54:45.401 --> 03:54:50.886]  This president has a way of trying to get into people's heads and indoctrinate them.
[03:54:51.146 --> 03:54:56.672]  He's been saying no collusion, no collusion, no collusion over and over again for a long time now.
[03:54:57.032 --> 03:55:02.698]  And he's going to try and conclude that this report is proving that there's no collusion.
[03:55:03.158 --> 03:55:09.302]  And you have a lot of his sycophants who will, you know, take the nod from him and they'll say the same thing.
[03:55:09.842 --> 03:55:12.664]  But we cannot allow them to get away with this.
[03:55:12.984 --> 03:55:14.665]  He does this all the time.
[03:55:15.106 --> 03:55:17.627]  This is not the end of anything.
[03:55:17.947 --> 03:55:23.071]  This is the, well, it's the end of the report and the investigation by Mueller.
[03:55:23.371 --> 03:55:29.495]  But those of us who chair these committees have a responsibility to continue with our oversight.
[03:55:30.859 --> 03:55:37.406]  There's so much that needs to be, you know... It's the end of the Democrats is what it is.
[03:55:38.026 --> 03:55:39.288]  It's the end of the Democrats.
[03:55:39.468 --> 03:55:40.449]  They're done.
[03:55:41.850 --> 03:55:45.514]  It should be the end of CNN, MSNBC, and the rest of them.
[03:55:45.554 --> 03:55:49.418]  For two years they pushed this fake news over and over.
[03:55:49.458 --> 03:55:52.001]  It should be the end of the left.
[03:55:53.391 --> 03:55:57.294]  If you ask me, the Democrats have played too many cards.
[03:55:57.534 --> 03:56:00.316]  They got caught with too many cards up their sleeve.
[03:56:00.736 --> 03:56:01.177]  Cheating.
[03:56:01.477 --> 03:56:01.937]  Lying.
[03:56:03.679 --> 03:56:04.819]  They colluded with Russia.
[03:56:05.320 --> 03:56:06.240]  Not President Trump.
[03:56:07.241 --> 03:56:07.802]  They're done.
[03:56:08.762 --> 03:56:09.303]  It's finished.
[03:56:09.483 --> 03:56:10.083]  They're finished.
[03:56:11.945 --> 03:56:15.987]  We're going to drill this horse until the horse can't even be drilled any longer.
[03:56:16.548 --> 03:56:17.328]  The dead horse.
[03:56:17.809 --> 03:56:19.770]  Because the Russia collusion is dead.
[03:56:19.950 --> 03:56:20.391]  It's over.
[03:56:20.711 --> 03:56:22.312]  And people need to recognize what happened.
[03:56:23.300 --> 03:56:32.368]  So like I said in the beginning of this, there's one other thing that I think we should be addressing, and it should be all over the news, but because of the whole Russia collusion thing is shadowing.
[03:56:32.809 --> 03:56:36.172]  And that is the interview with Alex Jones and Joe Rogan.
[03:56:36.953 --> 03:56:41.917]  It's so important that everyone views that video.
[03:56:42.538 --> 03:56:44.320]  You share that video.
[03:56:45.040 --> 03:56:46.281]  Go to the Infowars.com.
[03:56:46.301 --> 03:56:47.302]  It's on the main page.
[03:56:47.603 --> 03:56:48.844]  You can see it right there.
[03:56:49.497 --> 03:56:51.478]  You have to share that video.
[03:56:51.738 --> 03:56:59.383]  See, with all the censorship that's going on, they do not want us to pay attention to the real issues that's affecting all of us.
[03:56:59.423 --> 03:57:01.644]  This Russia collusion is not even a real issue.
[03:57:01.924 --> 03:57:05.386]  The real issue is how they're censoring Americans.
[03:57:05.946 --> 03:57:13.592]  If they truly cared about Americans, they would spend 100% drilling down the censorship that's taking place in America.
[03:57:13.933 --> 03:57:15.754]  It's Nazi Germany all over again.
[03:57:15.994 --> 03:57:19.577]  Except for physical books, they are burning digital books.
[03:57:19.938 --> 03:57:22.920]  It's digital books that they're burning here in the United States.
[03:57:23.701 --> 03:57:25.122]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:57:25.462 --> 03:57:27.043]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:27.684 --> 03:57:30.626]  So much information, there's never enough time to get it all out.
[03:57:31.207 --> 03:57:34.029]  Coming up next is the War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:35.871]  You gotta stay tuned.
[03:57:36.371 --> 03:57:39.092]  He's gonna be full of information as he always is.
[03:57:39.172 --> 03:57:40.092]  My name is Will Johnson.
[03:57:40.112 --> 03:57:43.014]  Go to UnitedAmericaFirst.com and check me out.
[03:57:43.334 --> 03:57:45.955]  God bless you, God bless America, and God bless our President.
[03:57:46.855 --> 03:57:47.756]  InfoWars.com!
[03:57:54.292 --> 03:57:58.736]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[03:57:58.956 --> 03:58:03.639]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[03:58:04.260 --> 03:58:10.124]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[03:58:10.525 --> 03:58:23.115]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you can actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[03:58:23.875 --> 03:58:32.583]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[03:58:32.603 --> 03:58:34.485]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
