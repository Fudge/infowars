[00:00:07.225 --> 00:00:15.849]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Democrats and the mainstream American media have fully exposed themselves as the fascist authoritarians they are.
[00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:24.253]  Thank God there is one man standing in the way of this fascist circus, the Michael Cohen testimony.
[00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:26.174]  And that man is Jim Jordan.
[00:00:26.174 --> 00:00:29.955]  Here was his opening statement.
[00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:30.976]  Mr. Chairman, here we go.
[00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:36.829]  Here we go, your first big hearing, your first announced witness, Michael Cohen.
[00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.570]  I want everyone in this room to think about this.
[00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:47.455]  The first announced witness for the 116th Congress is a guy who is going to prison in two months for lying to Congress.
[00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:52.318]  Mr. Chairman, your chairmanship will always be identified with this hearing.
[00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.960]  And we all need to understand what this is.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.062]  This is the Michael Cohen hearing presented by Lanny Davis.
[00:00:59.062 --> 00:00:59.543]  That's right.
[00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:04.491]  Lanny Davis choreographed the whole darn thing.
[00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:10.634]  The Clinton's best friend, loyalist, operative, Lanny Davis put this all together.
[00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:11.234]  You know how we know?
[00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:12.595]  He told our staff.
[00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:13.675]  He told the committee staff.
[00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:15.436]  He said the hearing was his idea.
[00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:16.777]  He selected this committee.
[00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:19.378]  He had to talk Michael Cohen into coming.
[00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:23.080]  And most importantly, he had to persuade the chairman to actually have it.
[00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:28.132]  He told us it took two months to get that job done, but here we are.
[00:01:28.132 --> 00:01:29.753]  He talked him into it.
[00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:37.875]  This might be the first time someone convicted of lying to Congress has appeared again so quickly in front of Congress.
[00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:45.117]  Certainly, it's the first time a convicted perjurer has been brought back to be a star witness in a hearing.
[00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:50.259]  And there's a reason this is the first, because no other committee would do it.
[00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.180]  Think about this, with Mr. Cohen here, this committee.
[00:01:54.073 --> 00:01:55.615]  We got lots of lawyers on this committee.
[00:01:55.615 --> 00:02:00.200]  This committee is actually encouraging a witness to violate attorney-client privilege.
[00:02:02.182 --> 00:02:07.523]  Mr. Chairman, when we legitimize dishonesty, we delegitimize this institution.
[00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:09.964]  We're supposed to pursue the truth.
[00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:12.524]  But you have stacked the deck against the truth.
[00:02:12.524 --> 00:02:14.365]  We're only allowed to ask certain questions.
[00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:17.786]  Even with that amendment you just told us about, well, Russia's now on the table.
[00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:24.987]  You initially told us we can't ask questions about the special counsel, can't ask questions about the Southern District of New York, can't ask questions about Russia.
[00:02:24.987 --> 00:02:26.147]  Nope.
[00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:26.948]  Nope.
[00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:28.328]  Only subjects we can talk about.
[00:02:29.352 --> 00:02:34.456]  Are ones you think are going to be harmful to the President of the United States.
[00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:40.161]  And the answers to those questions are going to come from a guy who can't be trusted.
[00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:40.801]  Here's what the U.S.
[00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:43.243]  Attorney said about Mr. Cohen.
[00:02:43.243 --> 00:02:52.091]  While Mr. Cohen enjoyed a privileged life, his desire for ever greater wealth and influence precipitated an extensive course of criminal conduct.
[00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:59.280]  Mr. Cohen committed four, four distinct federal crimes over a period of several years.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:08.603]  He was motivated to do so by personal greed and repeatedly, repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends.
[00:03:08.603 --> 00:03:10.944]  But the Democrats don't care.
[00:03:10.944 --> 00:03:11.564]  They don't care.
[00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:13.405]  They just want to use you, Mr. Cohen.
[00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:15.366]  You're their patsy today.
[00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:22.268]  They got to find somebody, somewhere to say something so they can try to remove the president from office.
[00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.051]  As Tom Steyer told him to.
[00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:29.613]  Tom Steyer last week organized a town hall.
[00:03:29.613 --> 00:03:31.114]  Guess where?
[00:03:31.114 --> 00:03:33.716]  Chairman Nadler's district in Manhattan.
[00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:36.979]  Two nights ago, Tom Steyer organized a town hall.
[00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:38.620]  Guess where?
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.363]  Chairman Cummings' district in Baltimore.
[00:03:42.363 --> 00:03:47.586]  The best they can find, the best they can find to start this process?
[00:03:47.586 --> 00:03:48.227]  Michael Cohen.
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.943]  Fraudster, a cheat, convicted felon, and in two months, a federal inmate.
[00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:55.444]  Well, actually, they didn't find him.
[00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:57.325]  Laney Davis found him.
[00:03:57.325 --> 00:03:59.547]  I'll say one thing about the Democrats.
[00:03:59.547 --> 00:04:01.488]  They stick to the playbook.
[00:04:01.488 --> 00:04:05.070]  Remember, remember how all this started.
[00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:15.057]  The Clinton campaign hired Perkins Coie law firm, who hired Glenn Simpson, who hired a foreigner, Christopher Steele, who put together the fake dossier.
[00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:21.123]  That the FBI used to go get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.
[00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:29.308]  But when that whole scheme failed, and the American people said we're gonna make Donald Trump president, they said we gotta do something else.
[00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:41.297]  So now, Clinton loyalist, Clinton operative, Lanny Davis, has persuaded the chairman of the Oversight Committee to give a convicted felon a forum
[00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:48.761]  Just tell stories and lie about the President of the United States, so they can all start their impeachment process.
[00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:51.742]  Mr. Chairman, we are better than this.
[00:04:51.742 --> 00:04:54.964]  We are better than this.
[00:04:54.964 --> 00:04:56.624]  Total savage.
[00:04:56.624 --> 00:04:58.125]  We'll be right back with the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:09.687 --> 00:05:18.692]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:05:18.692 --> 00:05:28.778]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:37.324]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:05:38.144 --> 00:05:39.485]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:40.646]  You must experience it.
[00:05:40.646 --> 00:05:42.627]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:05:42.627 --> 00:05:47.650]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.171]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:05:49.171 --> 00:05:50.632]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:05:50.632 --> 00:05:57.337]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:05:57.337 --> 00:05:58.818]  TurboForce at m4slife.com.
[00:06:06.975 --> 00:06:11.036]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:16.358]  Today and now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:16.358 --> 00:06:21.900]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is going to be a stacked Alex Jones Show here on this Wednesday, February 27th, 2019.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:31.823]  Owen Troyer filling in for Alex, but we will be hearing from Alex from a surprise, a surprise special undisclosed location.
[00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:35.525]  And we'll just leave it at that for now.
[00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:48.935]  And we also have a ton of news and clips to get to, but what everybody's focused on right now, probably unnecessarily, but there will be, let's just say, a boomerang effect of this Cohen testimony today.
[00:06:48.935 --> 00:06:51.877]  But we'll get to all that in the meantime.
[00:06:51.877 --> 00:06:56.600]  Let's go live to Cohen the rat testifying right now before Congress.
[00:06:56.954 --> 00:07:00.135]  What warning would you give young people who are tempted, as you were,
[00:07:22.622 --> 00:07:26.686]  Would you encourage them not to wait ten years to see the light?
[00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:34.292]  What advice would you give young people, in particular young lawyers, so they do not abuse their bar license as you did?
[00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:34.713]  He lost.
[00:07:34.713 --> 00:07:35.834]  He got into his bar yesterday.
[00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:37.795]  I had a wonderful life.
[00:07:37.795 --> 00:07:38.956]  I have a beautiful wife.
[00:07:38.956 --> 00:07:40.438]  I have two amazing children.
[00:07:41.534 --> 00:07:44.815]  I achieved financial success by the age of 39.
[00:07:44.815 --> 00:07:48.877]  I didn't go to work for Mr. Trump because I had to.
[00:07:48.877 --> 00:07:51.798]  I went to work for him because I wanted to.
[00:07:51.798 --> 00:07:53.678]  And I've lost it all.
[00:07:53.678 --> 00:07:58.360]  So if I'm not a picture perfect, that's the picture that should be up there.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:06.182]  If I'm not a picture perfect example of what not to do, that's the example that I'm trying to set for my children.
[00:08:06.182 --> 00:08:10.464]  You make mistakes in life, and I've owned them, and I've taken responsibility for them.
[00:08:11.226 --> 00:08:14.247]  And I'm paying a huge price, as is my family.
[00:08:14.247 --> 00:08:29.132]  So if that in and of itself isn't enough to dissuade somebody from acting in the callous manner that I did, I'm not sure that that person has any chance, very much like I'm in right now.
[00:08:29.132 --> 00:08:33.654]  A recurring theme in your testimony is concern for your family's safety.
[00:08:33.654 --> 00:08:35.815]  What specifically are you most concerned about?
[00:08:37.193 --> 00:08:44.419]  Well the president, unlike my Cohen for Trump that has a thousand followers, he's got over 60 million people.
[00:08:44.419 --> 00:08:51.986]  And when Mr. Trump turned around early in the campaign and said, I can shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and get away with it.
[00:08:52.762 --> 00:08:54.643]  I want to be very clear.
[00:08:54.643 --> 00:08:56.003]  He's not joking.
[00:08:56.003 --> 00:08:57.143]  He's telling you the truth.
[00:08:57.143 --> 00:08:59.284]  You see, you don't know him.
[00:08:59.284 --> 00:09:00.404]  I do.
[00:09:00.404 --> 00:09:03.925]  I sat next to this man for 10 years and I watched him.
[00:09:03.925 --> 00:09:05.485]  Wait, who shot Seth Rich?
[00:09:05.485 --> 00:09:06.886]  Who was Seth Rich?
[00:09:06.886 --> 00:09:07.866]  What happened to Seth Rich?
[00:09:07.866 --> 00:09:09.927]  I'm the one who continued in 2015 to promote him.
[00:09:12.323 --> 00:09:15.284]  So many things I thought that he can do that are just great.
[00:09:15.284 --> 00:09:18.805]  And he can and he is doing things that are great.
[00:09:18.805 --> 00:09:23.586]  But this destruction of our civility to one another is just, it's out of control.
[00:09:23.586 --> 00:09:26.246]  Oh yeah, it's Trump's fault, didn't you hear?
[00:09:26.246 --> 00:09:30.887]  Jussie Smollett was attacked by a Trump supporter in a MAGA hat!
[00:09:30.887 --> 00:09:35.868]  A man's house was burned down because he was a gay activist!
[00:09:35.868 --> 00:09:37.389]  Oh, those were hoaxes.
[00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:41.311]  You know there's a deep irony to this.
[00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:49.317]  It's not, it's like everything else, it's not President Trump's fault that your family would be in any danger, which we hope it's not.
[00:09:49.317 --> 00:09:49.718]  It's your fault!
[00:10:03.137 --> 00:10:09.220]  What is it with people in this country that don't want to take the consequences for their actions?
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.982]  You're the traitor, dude!
[00:10:11.982 --> 00:10:18.465]  Everybody's job at the Trump Organization is to protect Mr. Trump.
[00:10:18.465 --> 00:10:23.708]  Every day, most of us knew we were coming in and we were going to lie for him on something.
[00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:26.817]  And that became the norm.
[00:10:26.817 --> 00:10:30.659]  And that's exactly what's happening right now in this country.
[00:10:30.659 --> 00:10:34.122]  That's exactly what's happening here in government, sir.
[00:10:34.122 --> 00:10:34.903]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[00:10:34.903 --> 00:10:36.964]  My time has expired.
[00:10:36.964 --> 00:10:38.005]  Mr. Armstrong.
[00:10:38.005 --> 00:10:44.770]  Now, folks, this has been going for over an hour now.
[00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.972]  They're due for a recess.
[00:10:46.972 --> 00:10:49.814]  Cohen just requested a recess.
[00:10:49.814 --> 00:10:54.137]  I've never seen that before.
[00:10:54.137 --> 00:10:54.598]  I did, sir.
[00:10:55.776 --> 00:11:01.882]  Yeah, they're like, did you just ask for a break?
[00:11:01.882 --> 00:11:05.205]  That's okay, thank you, sir.
[00:11:05.205 --> 00:11:10.970]  I can't even figure out how to get Cummings' mic back on, so they will honor... Cohen's running the show!
[00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:11.791]  Ha!
[00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:13.272]  Oh my gosh!
[00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:13.712]  Oh!
[00:11:13.712 --> 00:11:18.036]  So Elijah Cummings, he just had his gavel taken from him by Cohen!
[00:11:18.036 --> 00:11:19.538]  Oh my gosh, that was beautiful!
[00:11:22.157 --> 00:11:23.398]  Wow.
[00:11:23.398 --> 00:11:25.319]  Look, here's the deal, folks.
[00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:30.784]  If you've been paying attention, I've been watching this whole thing.
[00:11:30.784 --> 00:11:37.610]  The optics of this, and on a surface level, this looks really bad.
[00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:45.817]  But I'm watching an epic car crash happening right now in slow motion.
[00:11:45.817 --> 00:11:46.638]  That's what this is.
[00:11:49.326 --> 00:11:57.831]  We're going to get more into this throughout the broadcast and we'll continue to cover this live and do a little commentary over it.
[00:11:57.831 --> 00:12:14.039]  But this whole thing with Cummings bringing up Michael Cohen as a star witness, his first ever, as the head of this committee, who's about to go to jail for a long time for lying to Congress, a known liar.
[00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:18.542]  Any lawyer who's not just a total liar will tell you
[00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:23.715]  I mean, folks, this is the whole reason why OJ Simpson was deemed innocent.
[00:12:23.715 --> 00:12:27.239]  You have to understand how the legal process works.
[00:12:27.239 --> 00:12:38.869]  As soon as you're deemed a liar, as soon as that's established by the court in the case, as soon as that's established that, okay, you lied, you're no longer a witness for anything!
[00:12:38.869 --> 00:12:42.772]  Anything you said or anything you say is discounted, you're out!
[00:12:43.766 --> 00:12:48.688]  That is like just precedent in law.
[00:12:48.688 --> 00:12:53.670]  But somehow Cohen comes back up here.
[00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.271]  Because the whole thing is a sham.
[00:12:55.271 --> 00:13:00.313]  Cohen even admitted he's been meeting with the Democrats before all of this.
[00:13:00.313 --> 00:13:05.135]  Elijah Cummings broke the rules of this committee.
[00:13:05.135 --> 00:13:09.037]  He broke the rules of the committee and he did not give
[00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:14.842]  24 hours of the witness testimony to the committee.
[00:13:14.842 --> 00:13:21.224]  They gave him the witness testimony, the documents, just hours before the testimony.
[00:13:21.224 --> 00:13:22.204]  That's against the rules.
[00:13:22.204 --> 00:13:25.085]  You're supposed to get 24 hours.
[00:13:25.085 --> 00:13:30.747]  Then Elijah Cummings has the nerve to sit there and lie about it.
[00:13:30.747 --> 00:13:31.947]  The whole thing is unbelievable.
[00:13:31.947 --> 00:13:34.448]  We got all the clips.
[00:13:34.448 --> 00:13:36.848]  And so, Jim Jordan just says, oh,
[00:13:39.744 --> 00:13:49.047]  Well, do you think we could maybe postpone this so that we can follow the rules and have 24 hours to go over the witness testimony that you just handed us before he sat down?
[00:13:49.047 --> 00:13:50.268]  We don't have time to review it.
[00:13:50.268 --> 00:13:51.708]  We don't have time to look at questions.
[00:13:51.708 --> 00:13:53.449]  You've been meeting with the witness.
[00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:54.890]  Do we get anything here?
[00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.271]  And Elijah Cummings just says, no!
[00:13:58.271 --> 00:13:59.211]  I'm in charge.
[00:13:59.211 --> 00:14:00.072]  I'm the Democrat.
[00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:01.492]  I'm the boss, like AOC.
[00:14:01.492 --> 00:14:02.913]  I'm the boss!
[00:14:02.913 --> 00:14:06.574]  The Democrats are fully exposing themselves as fascist authoritarians today.
[00:14:08.846 --> 00:14:14.948]  So, there is going to be massive blowback from this, and let me tell ya, oh folks, we're gonna get into all of it.
[00:14:14.948 --> 00:14:23.350]  Before we do that, though, we need to fuel the engine here at InfoWars with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.571]  And we've got great specials going right now.

[00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:57.807]  The store is so big now.
[00:14:58.928 --> 00:15:03.991]  It's almost impossible to sit here in a minute and even get to like a quarter of the stuff we offer.
[00:15:03.991 --> 00:15:08.793]  Household items like shampoo and toothpaste, it's all natural, it's all organic.
[00:15:08.793 --> 00:15:15.876]  Air filters, water filters, you've seen the stories about the stuff in the water that's no good, the glyphosates and everything.
[00:15:15.876 --> 00:15:22.360]  You've seen the stories about the air in the average American home being so polluted it's equivalent to a major U.S.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:22.600]  city.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.126]  So we just say, hey, look, there's bad stuff in the water.
[00:15:26.126 --> 00:15:27.208]  We don't want to drink it.
[00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:28.290]  You don't want to drink it.
[00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.114]  Here's the best water filter for the best price.
[00:15:30.114 --> 00:15:31.777]  Here's the best air filter for the best price now.
[00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:38.024]  In the break, I've got a long day today, because I'm going to be hosting the Alex Jones Show, and then I'm going to be hosting the War Room.
[00:15:38.024 --> 00:15:49.135]  So in the break, I'm going to take my Turbo Force, which is 33% off at InfoWarsStore.com, and it will energize me for the next seven hours that I'll be live here at InfoWars.com slash show.
[00:15:49.135 --> 00:15:50.116]  I'm banned!
[00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.939]  I'm totally banned on Facebook and YouTube!
[00:15:52.939 --> 00:15:56.603]  So, you know, InfoWars.com slash show is the last place I can go to broadcast.
[00:15:59.554 --> 00:16:00.774]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.774 --> 00:16:04.676]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:04.676 --> 00:16:06.217]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:06.217 --> 00:16:09.178]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:09.178 --> 00:16:14.740]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.940]  I can help you, too.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.881]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:16:18.881 --> 00:16:21.102]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:16:21.102 --> 00:16:25.544]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:16:25.544 --> 00:16:27.885]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[00:16:29.105 --> 00:16:35.448]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:16:35.448 --> 00:16:38.489]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:16:38.489 --> 00:16:44.052]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:16:44.412 --> 00:16:48.193]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:16:48.193 --> 00:16:49.473]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:16:49.473 --> 00:16:50.473]  Who do we fight for?
[00:16:50.473 --> 00:16:56.995]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[00:18:03.072 --> 00:18:06.093]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:18:06.093 --> 00:18:12.536]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[00:18:12.536 --> 00:18:28.003]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[00:19:00.194 --> 00:19:08.578]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:19:08.578 --> 00:19:09.819]  Believe me, I know.
[00:19:09.819 --> 00:19:14.741]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:19:14.741 --> 00:19:17.803]  But thanks to super male vitality at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:19:18.303 --> 00:19:19.964]  I still have that energy.
[00:19:19.964 --> 00:19:40.138]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:44.381]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[00:19:48.304 --> 00:19:53.307]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[00:19:53.307 --> 00:19:56.029]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[00:19:56.029 --> 00:20:03.335]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:05.977]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:11.721 --> 00:20:15.504]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
[00:20:15.504 --> 00:20:20.287]  Because what I'm about to tell you is a matter of life and death.
[00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:26.971]  Now, a lot of people will tell you they're
[00:20:40.552 --> 00:20:41.052]  On target.
[00:20:41.052 --> 00:20:44.515]  A lot of folks will tell you that they've got the answers.
[00:20:44.515 --> 00:20:48.257]  But they don't have the answers.
[00:20:48.257 --> 00:20:50.158]  I do have the answers.
[00:20:50.158 --> 00:20:52.880]  And that's not an arrogant statement.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:21:06.429]  If I've got the part that works on a car that's broken down, and I know it's the part that works because I've tested it, and there's a hundred idiots out there trying to put parts on it that aren't even from the same car and don't work, I'm going to say, hey, listen,
[00:21:08.211 --> 00:21:10.312]  I've got the part that works.
[00:21:10.312 --> 00:21:13.193]  I know what the hell I'm talking about.
[00:21:13.193 --> 00:21:17.914]  Why do you think the establishment wants us off air?
[00:21:17.914 --> 00:21:23.816]  Because they get you watching football and they get all of us watching Dancing with the Stars, which is fine.
[00:21:23.816 --> 00:21:34.239]  But everybody's experts on that instead of defense intelligence and international commerce and the rule of law.
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:47.745]  Cancer viruses, space stations, you know, things that are really going on in the real world by the technocracy that runs things and governs things and decides the direction of the world.
[00:21:47.745 --> 00:21:54.648]  We had kings and queens and elites that would decide the direction of the world, and they kept us in feudalism in a dark age.
[00:21:54.648 --> 00:21:58.050]  And then 500 years ago, the Gutenberg Press came along in Europe
[00:21:59.016 --> 00:22:02.839]  And challenge the monopoly of the crown and the church.
[00:22:02.839 --> 00:22:06.462]  And we came out of the Dark Age into the Renaissance.
[00:22:06.462 --> 00:22:09.324]  And you go back, I'm gonna give you the secret to everything.
[00:22:09.324 --> 00:22:14.047]  You go back to Plato, 2,300 years ago in Greece, the king of philosophers.
[00:22:14.047 --> 00:22:16.949]  And he said humans are crushing the breast of Mother Earth.
[00:22:16.949 --> 00:22:18.551]  The Earth's overpopulated.
[00:22:18.551 --> 00:22:23.594]  Even though there are probably 20 million people on the planet then instead of seven and a half billion.
[00:22:23.594 --> 00:22:26.136]  He said we need to kill all the dumb people.
[00:22:26.136 --> 00:22:27.537]  And sometimes I kind of agree with that.
[00:22:27.537 --> 00:22:28.378]  But see, here's the problem.
[00:22:30.233 --> 00:22:33.134]  The globalists are actually trying to make us dumb.
[00:22:33.134 --> 00:22:40.737]  The parlor eugenics on the outside is that, oh, we're trying to make people smarter.
[00:22:40.737 --> 00:22:41.158]  No, no, no.
[00:22:41.158 --> 00:22:45.540]  They want to control society and civilization.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:54.283]  So we've seen AOC, you know, that's the lady that looks like a meth head in Congress from New York, tell us we don't need to have kids anymore because the world's ending in 12 years.
[00:22:54.283 --> 00:22:55.544]  They want you to give up.
[00:22:56.513 --> 00:23:11.282]  They want you to have a fatalistic view, and then they hit you with electromagnetic radiation, they hit you with the GMO, they hit you with tainted vaccines, they hit you with the brainwashing, the race war, the culture war, the demoralization!
[00:23:11.282 --> 00:23:19.447]  So they can dominate and control you, divide and conquer you, and then they hit you with malnutrition.
[00:23:19.447 --> 00:23:21.148]  Everybody knows if you don't have water, you die.
[00:23:22.739 --> 00:23:24.060]  If you don't have air, you die.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.942]  Well, if you don't have vitamin C, you end up dying in a few months.
[00:23:26.942 --> 00:23:31.284]  And if you don't have iodine, folks, an essential element, you're screwed.
[00:23:31.284 --> 00:23:39.289]  And that's what's so exciting is that if they can't abort a baby before it's born, well, hell, now kill it after it's born.
[00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:41.491]  That's what the Democrats in the Senate just voted to do.
[00:23:41.491 --> 00:23:46.013]  They agree with the Democrats in Virginia and New York, kill babies after they're born.
[00:23:46.013 --> 00:23:46.774]  That's the bad news.
[00:23:46.774 --> 00:23:49.776]  The good news is there's all these other ways they're getting at us.
[00:23:51.058 --> 00:23:59.969]  And back when the government wasn't pure evil, they put iodine in the salt by law and it boosted IQs on average 15 points and cut out all these birth defects.
[00:23:59.969 --> 00:24:04.695]  And it's because if you don't have iodine in many cases, you have electrochemical problems in the brain.
[00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:05.256]  It's a fact.
[00:24:05.256 --> 00:24:05.917]  You die!
[00:24:07.486 --> 00:24:12.529]  Oh, but they give you the bad halogen fluoride that lowers IQ, lowers fertility.
[00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:13.510]  So here's the good news.
[00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.472]  I'm going to play this green piece with David Knight and myself and others.
[00:24:17.472 --> 00:24:18.553]  It's about four years old.
[00:24:18.553 --> 00:24:19.934]  It's very powerful.
[00:24:19.934 --> 00:24:23.296]  That breaks down how the dystopia we warned you of is now here.
[00:24:23.296 --> 00:24:24.957]  They're rolling it out.
[00:24:24.957 --> 00:24:33.622]  But the good news is I told you almost two years ago I was having fights with the oil companies that get the pure deep earth crystalline and nobody else has this atomic and
[00:24:35.003 --> 00:24:40.869]  We went to fisticuffs with them, came out with a new iodine that's still really good, has some of the deep earth crystal, and two other types.
[00:24:40.869 --> 00:24:44.352]  We could have made it pure deep earth crystal, but it's from another manufacturer.
[00:24:44.352 --> 00:24:46.354]  And so some folks like it, some folks don't.
[00:24:46.354 --> 00:24:47.556]  It's X3.
[00:24:47.556 --> 00:24:55.263]  I got old-fashioned X2, pure, same manufacturer, same oil company, 12,000 feet, it's amazing, and fullworkstore.com.
[00:24:55.263 --> 00:24:58.366]  So they can pull all the stuff they're going to do all day, but God's given us things
[00:24:59.187 --> 00:25:05.050]  Like iodine, like oxygen, like water, like food, like our mothers, like our fathers.
[00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:07.512]  That is what gives us sustenance.
[00:25:07.512 --> 00:25:08.792]  And X2 is back.
[00:25:08.792 --> 00:25:10.233]  It's been produced.
[00:25:10.233 --> 00:25:11.434]  The labels are being put on today.
[00:25:11.434 --> 00:25:15.476]  You can pre-order at mfulworthstore.com or mfulworthslife.com.
[00:25:15.476 --> 00:25:20.298]  And the 18-wheeler leaves tomorrow from the Rocky Mountains to deliver it to Austin.
[00:25:20.298 --> 00:25:22.920]  So as early as a week from now, let's just say a week and a half from now,

[00:25:56.719 --> 00:26:05.743]  Back to Owen on the live broadcast after this important piece on Soylent Green and how this dystopic nightmare has now come true.
[00:26:05.743 --> 00:26:10.026]  Aborted babies incinerated to eat in UK hospitals.
[00:26:11.261 --> 00:26:15.426]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[00:26:15.426 --> 00:26:21.673]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[00:26:21.673 --> 00:26:26.818]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:30.102]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[00:26:31.303 --> 00:26:34.186]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[00:26:34.186 --> 00:26:36.828]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:41.673]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[00:26:41.673 --> 00:26:44.676]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[00:26:44.676 --> 00:26:48.280]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausting.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.801]  You must evacuate the area.
[00:26:52.534 --> 00:27:05.063]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[00:27:05.063 --> 00:27:07.025]  So enjoy the flavor.
[00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:11.688]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death penalties and sales taxes.
[00:27:11.688 --> 00:27:13.649]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[00:27:13.649 --> 00:27:15.531]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[00:27:15.531 --> 00:27:16.852]  I'm for regular suicide.
[00:27:16.852 --> 00:27:18.433]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[00:27:18.573 --> 00:27:22.997]  He is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient.
[00:27:22.997 --> 00:27:30.064]  Would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[00:27:30.064 --> 00:27:34.449]  But that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:27:34.449 --> 00:27:40.755]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[00:27:48.948 --> 00:27:51.549]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:56.451]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[00:27:56.451 --> 00:27:58.971]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[00:27:58.971 --> 00:28:08.335]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[00:28:08.335 --> 00:28:11.516]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[00:28:11.516 --> 00:28:13.676]  The scoops are on their way!
[00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:15.037]  The scoops are on their way!
[00:28:16.237 --> 00:28:19.419]  I repeat, the spooks are on their way!
[00:28:19.419 --> 00:28:22.660]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.881]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[00:28:25.881 --> 00:28:27.822]  We've got to stop them!
[00:28:27.822 --> 00:28:32.844]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:38.186]  Soylent Green is people!
[00:28:38.186 --> 00:28:41.728]  I just think they'll be pretty if you let's get them.
[00:28:41.728 --> 00:28:42.748]  But who?
[00:28:42.748 --> 00:28:43.909]  We've got to tell them.
[00:28:45.359 --> 00:28:48.405]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:48.405 --> 00:28:51.912]  The recess is over and the Cohen testimony.
[00:28:51.912 --> 00:28:55.879]  When we come back from this short break, we will go back live.
[00:28:55.879 --> 00:28:56.680]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.682]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.502]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.502 --> 00:29:06.826]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.826 --> 00:29:08.407]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.407 --> 00:29:16.774]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:16.774 --> 00:29:22.459]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[00:29:24.461 --> 00:29:26.624]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:26.624 --> 00:29:31.130]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.313]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:30:18.694 --> 00:30:28.779]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[00:30:47.649 --> 00:30:49.150]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.631]  It lasts 10 hours.

[00:32:00.148 --> 00:32:13.553]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[00:32:13.553 --> 00:32:24.597]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[00:32:25.916 --> 00:32:27.842]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[00:32:27.842 --> 00:32:30.510]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[00:32:31.869 --> 00:32:36.211]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[00:32:36.211 --> 00:32:40.473]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[00:32:40.473 --> 00:32:42.754]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[00:32:42.754 --> 00:32:45.075]  This country is in a war!
[00:32:45.075 --> 00:32:55.760]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.342]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[00:33:03.261 --> 00:33:05.890]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.331 --> 00:33:23.011]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:23.011 --> 00:33:24.732]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:24.732 --> 00:33:26.672]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.672 --> 00:33:30.473]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:30.473 --> 00:33:34.574]  So, we're gonna go back to this Cohen testimony, but I gotta be honest with you, folks.
[00:33:34.574 --> 00:33:38.495]  There's so much other stuff happening that's really more relevant than this.
[00:33:38.495 --> 00:33:41.376]  This is just kind of like the Circus Act right now.
[00:33:41.376 --> 00:33:48.737]  The three ring circus that everyone's paying attention to, everybody wants to watch, so I get it, and we're gonna go back to it live here, but there's so much other stuff going on.
[00:33:48.737 --> 00:33:50.358]  Plus, we've got
[00:33:51.721 --> 00:33:58.588]  Three powerful segments, almost an hour of content from Robert Barnes, who was in studio yesterday.
[00:33:58.588 --> 00:34:01.631]  This guy is sharp as a tack.
[00:34:01.631 --> 00:34:05.155]  I mean, this guy is with it and tuned in.
[00:34:05.155 --> 00:34:09.018]  A great intellectual and a great lawyer and just
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:22.092]  Really a great man who is going to be breaking down a lot of stuff when it comes to the legalities that we're dealing with here when it comes to censorship and
[00:34:23.638 --> 00:34:30.364]  Fair trade practices which is also in the news today as a new FTC task force has just been formed to take on Tech Monopoly.
[00:34:30.364 --> 00:34:36.229]  So we're going to cover all that plus still big announcement, big exciting stuff coming from Alex Jones.
[00:34:36.229 --> 00:34:44.575]  I'm not allowed to discuss it quite yet but you will find out shortly where Alex is and why.
[00:34:44.575 --> 00:34:48.599]  And then there's just other news that's developing right now and there's a well
[00:34:50.011 --> 00:34:57.435]  Let's just go back live now to the three ring circus that is the Michael Cohen testimony.
[00:34:57.435 --> 00:35:06.220]  Saying that to me for many many months and at the end of the day I knew exactly what he wanted me to say.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:08.101]  And why was Mr. Sekulow in the meeting?
[00:35:09.218 --> 00:35:19.205]  Mr. Trump directed me to... Because he was going to be representing Mr. Trump going forward as one of his personal attorneys in this matter.
[00:35:19.205 --> 00:35:21.126]  So it was sort of a handoff meeting?
[00:35:21.126 --> 00:35:23.908]  Correct.
[00:35:23.908 --> 00:35:31.452]  In any way, final question, did the President in any way... So, you know, look, ladies and gentlemen, we played Jim Jordan's opening statements here.
[00:35:31.452 --> 00:35:33.374]  We're going to go back to the testimony here in a second.
[00:35:36.076 --> 00:35:45.058]  Just so we can get some of this out there before we move on to other topics because I think it's beginning to get a little bit redundant.
[00:35:45.058 --> 00:35:52.320]  Elijah Cummings has really exposed himself in this testimony here.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.601]  He broke the rules in his first ever hearing as the head of this committee.
[00:35:56.601 --> 00:36:02.463]  He's acted like a authoritarian fascist while in control of this committee with the gavel.
[00:36:03.795 --> 00:36:07.096]  And he lies about Republicans.
[00:36:07.096 --> 00:36:08.976]  He said Republicans don't want to hear from Cohen.
[00:36:08.976 --> 00:36:10.256]  Well, that was an outright lie.
[00:36:10.256 --> 00:36:25.920]  What Jim Jordan said was, hey, can we postpone this so that we can follow the rules of this committee, which both parties agreed to, which was we get 24 hours to review the witness testimony statements before we come to this room and hear the testimony.
[00:36:26.721 --> 00:36:28.722]  So that we can prepare questions, etc.
[00:36:28.722 --> 00:36:34.306]  The Democrats have been meeting with Cohen for weeks, months, maybe even years.
[00:36:34.306 --> 00:36:37.288]  And Cohen admitted that today, when questioned.
[00:36:37.288 --> 00:36:40.570]  So the Democrats got the leaked testimony.
[00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:44.072]  Even CNN got the leaked testimony.
[00:36:44.072 --> 00:36:49.076]  And they gave it to the Republicans just an hour before the testimony began.
[00:36:49.076 --> 00:36:50.577]  That's against the rules.
[00:36:51.377 --> 00:36:58.941]  And so Jim Jordan says, well, can we postpone this so that we can review the testimony and know what we can even ask this witness here today?
[00:36:58.941 --> 00:37:01.482]  And Elijah Cummings says, no!
[00:37:01.482 --> 00:37:03.043]  And then moves on.
[00:37:03.043 --> 00:37:06.685]  So he's blatantly breaking the rules, and then he makes another statement saying that
[00:37:07.714 --> 00:37:12.919]  Republicans don't want to hear from Cohen, even though Jim Jordan specifically said, we want to hear from Cohen!
[00:37:12.919 --> 00:37:14.881]  We want to question Cohen!
[00:37:14.881 --> 00:37:20.646]  You guys are the ones that brought this convicted liar in front of this committee!
[00:37:20.646 --> 00:37:21.888]  Not me!
[00:37:21.888 --> 00:37:22.969]  You did that, Cummings!
[00:37:22.969 --> 00:37:24.150]  Of course we want to question him!
[00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.133]  But then Cummings says, the Republicans are trying to avoid questioning him.
[00:37:27.133 --> 00:37:30.235]  And Jordan's like, no, we want to follow the rules of this committee.
[00:37:30.235 --> 00:37:30.496]  And again,
[00:37:32.662 --> 00:37:36.665]  How did CNN get this leaked testimony, folks?
[00:37:36.665 --> 00:37:37.986]  This is unheard of.
[00:37:37.986 --> 00:37:51.776]  So not only is Cohen meeting with Democrats this entire process, they're leaking his testimony to CNN before the Republicans in the committee even get to see it, which is against the rules.
[00:37:51.776 --> 00:37:59.081]  And again, why is he meeting with the Democrats like this?
[00:37:59.081 --> 00:38:01.603]  So let's go back live to the Cohen testimony.
[00:38:06.937 --> 00:38:09.318]  Is that being a good lawyer?
[00:38:09.318 --> 00:38:14.459]  To not even consider whether it's legal or not?
[00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:15.920]  I didn't work for the campaign.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.701]  I was working and I was trying to protect Mr. Trump.
[00:38:19.701 --> 00:38:23.903]  I sat with Mr. Trump and this goes back all the way to 2011.
[00:38:23.903 --> 00:38:26.363]  This wasn't the first scenario with Ms.
[00:38:26.363 --> 00:38:26.783]  Daniels.
[00:38:26.783 --> 00:38:27.604]  Let's go back then.
[00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:31.611]  Yes, the porn star.
[00:38:31.611 --> 00:38:34.233]  This was an ongoing situation.
[00:38:34.233 --> 00:38:37.654]  It didn't just start.
[00:38:37.654 --> 00:38:39.695]  So again, this is just getting redundant, folks.
[00:38:39.695 --> 00:38:44.818]  They keep bringing up the porn star Stormy Daniels.
[00:38:44.818 --> 00:38:46.939]  There's a portrait that they talked about.
[00:38:46.939 --> 00:38:48.159]  We'll get into all this.
[00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.460]  Cohen was disbarred yesterday.
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.202]  But here's the irony.
[00:38:53.202 --> 00:38:57.564]  And you know, I don't know if I want to get into this now or later, but it's like
[00:38:59.209 --> 00:39:01.330]  This is playing out so perfectly.
[00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:18.480]  It's almost like a movie or a book or something here because all of this crap they're trying to say, oh look at what Trump did that was so bad, paying off this porn star, buying this portrait, pretending like there was a big bid on it and all this crap.
[00:39:21.249 --> 00:39:28.912]  If they really want to do this and try to destroy him, do you realize the dirt that they can get on Obama, the Clintons, the Bushes?
[00:39:28.912 --> 00:39:30.453]  I mean, it's a joke!
[00:39:30.453 --> 00:39:40.317]  The stuff that Donald Trump did that they're sitting here acting like is a big deal is like breadcrumbs of breadcrumbs compared to what the political establishment has been doing in this country.
[00:39:40.317 --> 00:39:41.777]  I mean, it's unbelievable!
[00:39:41.777 --> 00:39:46.980]  Do you really want to take Trump to task on a freaking portrait that he bought?
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:47.480]  A portrait?
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.761]  That he had a straw man bid on at an auction?
[00:39:50.761 --> 00:39:52.301]  Oh my gosh!
[00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:56.503]  Bill, I mean, how much money did the Clintons launder from Haiti?
[00:39:56.503 --> 00:39:59.244]  How much money did Prescott Bush get from the Nazis?
[00:39:59.244 --> 00:40:02.185]  I mean, this is a joke!
[00:40:02.185 --> 00:40:05.586]  And it's, it's, I'm telling you, it's a car crash in slow motion.
[00:40:05.586 --> 00:40:08.647]  I don't even know if Trump knew what he was getting himself into, folks.
[00:40:08.647 --> 00:40:10.908]  And it's just all playing out beautifully.
[00:40:12.068 --> 00:40:15.970]  And Trump's going to have the option if he wants to fight back against these people and expose them.
[00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:19.792]  So let's go back to the rat called forth here by the Democrats.
[00:40:19.792 --> 00:40:24.675]  I reported to the media on June 12th that those emails would be leaked.
[00:40:24.675 --> 00:40:26.696]  So I'm not saying you have fake news.
[00:40:26.696 --> 00:40:28.797]  I'm saying you have old news.
[00:40:28.797 --> 00:40:30.878]  And there's really not much to that.
[00:40:30.878 --> 00:40:36.701]  I would like to yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Higgins.
[00:40:36.701 --> 00:40:38.322]  Thank you, sir.
[00:40:38.322 --> 00:40:39.823]  Mr. Cohen, you know,
[00:40:40.333 --> 00:40:41.494]  I'm quoting you as close as I can.
[00:40:41.494 --> 00:40:47.137]  Earlier you said, I spent last week looking through boxes to find documents that would support your accusations.
[00:40:47.137 --> 00:40:49.559]  Where are those boxes, good sir?
[00:40:49.559 --> 00:40:50.540]  Where are those boxes?
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:52.141]  Are they in your garage?
[00:40:52.141 --> 00:40:53.341]  They're in the storage.
[00:40:53.341 --> 00:40:57.164]  Are these not boxes that should have been turned over to investigative authorities?
[00:40:57.483 --> 00:41:01.105]  During the many criminal investigations you've been subject to?
[00:41:01.105 --> 00:41:04.246]  Sir, these are the boxes that were returned to me post the raid.
[00:41:04.246 --> 00:41:10.870]  If they include data pertinent to crimes that you've committed, should they not have been turned over and remanded to investigative authority?
[00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.711]  Did Mr. Lanny Davis know of these boxes?
[00:41:13.711 --> 00:41:14.992]  Gentlemen, I don't understand your question.
[00:41:14.992 --> 00:41:16.192]  You may answer the question.
[00:41:16.192 --> 00:41:17.573]  I don't understand his question, sir.
[00:41:17.573 --> 00:41:18.733]  Very well.
[00:41:18.733 --> 00:41:24.056]  I can't tell you how many times Cummings has cut a man off from his time and then says, but he can answer the question.
[00:41:24.056 --> 00:41:25.036]  And then you know what Cohen says?
[00:41:25.036 --> 00:41:26.157]  No, I'm not going to answer the question.
[00:41:26.789 --> 00:41:29.210]  Morning, thank you Chairman Cummings for convening.
[00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:30.070]  That's at least the third time.
[00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.371]  Thank you Mr. Cohen for voluntarily testifying this morning.
[00:41:33.371 --> 00:41:34.991]  Oh, voluntarily testifying!
[00:41:34.991 --> 00:41:35.432]  I love it!
[00:41:35.432 --> 00:41:37.272]  Oh, he's voluntarily testifying!
[00:41:37.272 --> 00:41:39.773]  This is all part of a big plea bargain, folks!
[00:41:39.773 --> 00:41:40.713]  This is a joke!
[00:41:40.713 --> 00:41:44.014]  These Democrats think you are an idiot!
[00:41:44.014 --> 00:41:47.435]  And special counsel means you were the attorney for him, is that right?
[00:41:47.435 --> 00:41:54.157]  Just means I was there in order to handle matters that he felt were significant and important to him individually.
[00:41:54.157 --> 00:41:55.818]  And those included legal matters?
[00:41:55.818 --> 00:41:56.178]  Yes, sir.
[00:41:57.057 --> 00:42:04.024]  Sir, as a former attorney, you're familiar with legal documents known as non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, is that right?
[00:42:04.024 --> 00:42:04.205]  Yes.
[00:42:05.652 --> 00:42:17.459]  Sir, I'm sure you know that NDAs properly written in scope can be reasonable in certain business contexts, but they can also be abused to create a chilling effect to silence people.
[00:42:17.459 --> 00:42:18.640]  Yes, yes.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:27.585]  Donald Trump, a billionaire, pull him out, Donald Trump, a billionaire, had some people sign some non-disclosure agreements.
[00:42:27.585 --> 00:42:29.806]  He is a bad guy.
[00:42:29.806 --> 00:42:30.267]  Meanwhile,
[00:42:31.187 --> 00:42:32.468]  Millions of dollars.
[00:42:32.468 --> 00:42:34.670]  Tens of millions of dollars spent.
[00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:39.895]  Taxpayer dollars spent to protect congressmen and women accused of sexual assault.
[00:42:39.895 --> 00:42:41.797]  Where are the hearings on that?
[00:42:41.797 --> 00:42:43.759]  Where are the investigations into that?
[00:42:43.759 --> 00:42:45.920]  Where is the national press on that?
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.001]  Nowhere.
[00:42:47.001 --> 00:42:49.404]  They all want to get Trump.
[00:42:49.404 --> 00:42:51.646]  It's an unbelievable game.
[00:42:51.646 --> 00:42:53.387]  It's a big con game.
[00:42:53.387 --> 00:42:55.089]  It's called the Get Trump Game.
[00:42:55.089 --> 00:42:55.869]  But guess what?
[00:42:55.869 --> 00:42:57.331]  America's getting sick of it.

[00:47:02.695 --> 00:47:05.437]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:32.702 --> 00:47:36.105]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, final segment of the first hour.
[00:47:36.105 --> 00:47:53.561]  We've got a lot of exciting stuff coming up here, folks, in the next three hours of the Alex Jones Show, including Alex Jones from a secret location on a secret mission from a secret dimension in secret space.
[00:47:55.171 --> 00:48:01.374]  But right now, Michael Cohen, it's not a secret, is now a Democrat puppet.
[00:48:01.374 --> 00:48:06.597]  But it's really not even the Democrats, they're just the ones puppeteering, at least appearing to puppeteer this testimony.
[00:48:06.597 --> 00:48:13.561]  It's really the deep state, which is comprised of Republicans and Democrats for decades, that are now
[00:48:14.747 --> 00:48:26.271]  Being represented by Bob Mueller as their president, trying to destroy everything Americana, which is President Trump, who is not part of their secret societies, not part of the deep state, getting elected.
[00:48:26.271 --> 00:48:39.975]  And now, you know, I gotta tell you though, and I'm gonna talk about this in the next hour, but this testimony has been pretty eye-opening to me on a couple of different levels, and it's making me
[00:48:42.353 --> 00:48:46.338]  Ask tough intellectual and philosophical questions to myself!
[00:48:47.898 --> 00:48:51.179]  When it comes to the Trump presidency.
[00:48:51.179 --> 00:48:52.699]  And so we're going to get into that in the next hour.
[00:48:52.699 --> 00:48:54.739]  But we're going to conclude, this is the final segment.
[00:48:54.739 --> 00:48:57.380]  I can't do this crap anymore with Cohen Live.
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.180]  It's a bunch of BS.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:58.880]  It's getting redundant.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.380]  The next two days are going to be behind closed doors.
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.081]  So it'll just be more of a Circus Act freak show.
[00:49:04.081 --> 00:49:06.981]  But so we're just going to conclude our live coverage of this now.
[00:49:06.981 --> 00:49:12.743]  We're going to come back in the next hour, play some clips, and then do some reaction commentary to it.
[00:49:12.743 --> 00:49:14.923]  But then we got to move on, folks, because we know what this is.
[00:49:15.683 --> 00:49:19.247]  Uh, we know what it's meant to be and there's other important news that we got to get to.
[00:49:19.247 --> 00:49:20.448]  So, so that's how we're going to do this.
[00:49:20.448 --> 00:49:24.952]  But so, so let's go ahead and just go back live to this for the final time, probably today on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:49:24.952 --> 00:49:32.020]  Uh, in case that's what you're tuned in to listen to, we got other more important stuff to cover folks, including Project Veritas just releasing another bombshell video.
[00:49:33.038 --> 00:49:38.981]  You know, Project Veritas just hits Grand Slam after Grand Slam after Grand Slam and then somehow they don't score any runs.
[00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:40.402]  You know, but whatever.
[00:49:40.402 --> 00:49:44.545]  So let's go back live to the rat, Michael Cohen.
[00:49:44.545 --> 00:49:45.945]  ...states this.
[00:49:45.945 --> 00:49:49.488]  This was not an act out of blind loyalty, as Cohen suggests.
[00:49:49.488 --> 00:49:58.613]  Cohen was driven by a desire to further ingratiate himself with potential future president for whom's political success Cohen himself claimed credit for.
[00:49:59.699 --> 00:50:12.246]  Now we're in a search for truth, and I don't know, Chairman, how we're supposed to obtain the truth in this quagmire of a hearing when the best witness we can bring before this has already been convicted of lying before us.
[00:50:12.246 --> 00:50:15.608]  And what's sad is the American people have seen this play out before.
[00:50:15.608 --> 00:50:21.971]  We have people in prominent positions fail, and then a couple years later they get a book deal.
[00:50:21.971 --> 00:50:28.935]  Now you're set to go to jail for a couple years, you come out with a multi-million book deal, that's not bad living.
[00:50:30.792 --> 00:50:43.821]  So my question is, will you today, will you today to commit to donate any further proceeds to book deals, to film reviews, to charity?
[00:50:43.821 --> 00:50:44.161]  Ooh.
[00:50:44.161 --> 00:50:45.102]  No.
[00:50:45.102 --> 00:50:46.323]  Oh!
[00:50:46.323 --> 00:50:47.904]  Will the gentleman yield?
[00:50:47.904 --> 00:50:48.324]  I'll yield.
[00:50:48.324 --> 00:50:49.285]  May I finish?
[00:50:49.285 --> 00:50:50.526]  Yield to Mr. Meadows.
[00:50:54.249 --> 00:51:02.661]  Mr. Chairman, may I finish my... Mr. Cohen, he's yielded to me, and so... I didn't answer my response.
[00:51:02.661 --> 00:51:03.883]  Listen... No, you did.
[00:51:03.883 --> 00:51:05.245]  You said no.
[00:51:05.245 --> 00:51:07.068]  Mr. Chairman, may I finish my response, please?
[00:51:07.068 --> 00:51:09.171]  I'll let you respond, but let's answer his question, please.
[00:51:10.168 --> 00:51:13.469]  Mr. Cohen, everything's been made of your lies in the past.
[00:51:13.469 --> 00:51:16.709]  I'm concerned about your lies today.
[00:51:16.709 --> 00:51:34.893]  Under your testimony just a few minutes ago, to me, you indicated that you had contracts with foreign entities, and yet we have a truth and testimony disclosure form which requires you to list those foreign contracts for the last two years, and you put N.A.
[00:51:34.893 --> 00:51:36.414]  on there.
[00:51:36.414 --> 00:51:37.394]  And it's a criminal
[00:51:38.917 --> 00:51:41.698]  Offense to not have that accurately.
[00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:43.118]  So when were you lying?
[00:51:43.118 --> 00:51:46.919]  Either in the testimony to me earlier today or when you filled out the form?
[00:51:46.919 --> 00:51:49.079]  Gentlemen, time has expired.
[00:51:49.079 --> 00:51:50.160]  And he won't answer.
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:54.661]  You may answer his question and then whatever you want to say on that.
[00:51:54.661 --> 00:51:57.922]  His questions, unfortunately, I don't have an answer.
[00:51:57.922 --> 00:51:58.442]  Told you!
[00:51:58.442 --> 00:51:59.202]  Told you he'd do it.
[00:51:59.202 --> 00:52:00.542]  He's been doing it all day.
[00:52:00.542 --> 00:52:01.042]  No, no, no.
[00:52:01.042 --> 00:52:02.102]  Mr. Chairman.
[00:52:02.102 --> 00:52:03.983]  As it relates.
[00:52:03.983 --> 00:52:06.924]  The gentleman is out of order.
[00:52:06.924 --> 00:52:08.224]  He said he does not have an answer.
[00:52:09.251 --> 00:52:14.815]  Mr. Chairman, when we were in the majority, with all due respect, Mr. Chairman, hold on.
[00:52:14.815 --> 00:52:17.597]  The gentleman has just said he doesn't have an answer.
[00:52:17.597 --> 00:52:19.058]  And you had gobbled it up over your time.
[00:52:19.058 --> 00:52:20.720]  He's under oath.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.561]  He's under oath to tell the truth.
[00:52:22.561 --> 00:52:24.863]  One of them is not accurate, Mr. Chairman.
[00:52:24.863 --> 00:52:26.023]  You have time to answer questions.
[00:52:26.023 --> 00:52:27.024]  Mr. Chairman, just a question.
[00:52:27.024 --> 00:52:28.125]  Mr. Chairman, just a question.
[00:52:30.287 --> 00:52:31.988]  Mr. Raskin.
[00:52:31.988 --> 00:52:35.609]  Mr. Cohen, thank you for your composure today.
[00:52:35.609 --> 00:52:40.590]  Our colleagues are not upset because you lied to Congress for the president.
[00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:44.631]  They're upset because you stopped lying to Congress for the president.
[00:52:44.631 --> 00:52:52.374]  Now, you've described the Trump campaign as a once-in-a-lifetime money-making opportunity, the greatest infomercial of all time, I think you said.
[00:52:52.374 --> 00:52:55.655]  And this may be the most trenchant observation of your whole testimony.
[00:52:56.115 --> 00:53:03.501]  Do you think the Trump campaign or presidency ever stopped being about making money for the president, his family, and his organization?
[00:53:03.501 --> 00:53:06.223]  The guy who's donating his salary.
[00:53:06.223 --> 00:53:07.444]  When did it stop being that?
[00:53:07.444 --> 00:53:09.065]  When he won the election.
[00:53:09.065 --> 00:53:10.807]  And what did it become about at that point?
[00:53:12.079 --> 00:53:15.621]  Then it had to be about figuring out what to do here in Washington.
[00:53:30.512 --> 00:53:33.573]  I received a phone... We don't want to hear... We're here to get the truth.
[00:53:33.573 --> 00:53:38.675]  Mr. Cohen, you either lied in these documents or lied to us today here in this testimony.
[00:53:38.675 --> 00:53:39.876]  Do you have comment?
[00:53:39.876 --> 00:53:40.216]  No.
[00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:41.036]  Elijah Cummings.
[00:53:41.036 --> 00:53:42.437]  He does not have to answer.
[00:53:42.437 --> 00:53:43.877]  Now, to more important things.
[00:53:43.877 --> 00:53:45.598]  What about these porn stars?
[00:53:45.598 --> 00:53:47.859]  Stormy Daniels, it started in 2011.
[00:53:47.859 --> 00:53:49.539]  Oh, I'll answer that!
[00:53:49.539 --> 00:53:50.780]  I know all about the porn stars!
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:53.881]  I don't know anything about my lies!
[00:53:53.881 --> 00:53:56.823]  I'm just a convicted liar, but I'll talk about porn stars all day!
[00:53:56.823 --> 00:54:00.545]  We were successful in having it taken down from the website.
[00:54:00.545 --> 00:54:15.754]  It wasn't until years later, right around the time of the campaign, did they come back and they ask, what are you going to do now because she's back on the trail trying to sell the story?
[00:54:15.754 --> 00:54:19.357]  At which point in time, David Pecker, on behalf of the National Enquirer,
[00:54:20.672 --> 00:54:27.178]  ...reached out to her and her attorney in order to go take a look at... Her attorney?
[00:54:27.178 --> 00:54:28.239]  What was his name?
[00:54:28.239 --> 00:54:29.300]  Lie detector test.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.161]  Was it Avenetti?
[00:54:30.161 --> 00:54:32.142]  ...to prove that she was telling the truth.
[00:54:32.142 --> 00:54:33.744]  Another known liar?
[00:54:33.744 --> 00:54:40.750]  They then contacted me and told me that she was telling the truth, at which point, again, all the time... She took a lie detector test?
[00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:42.792]  She allegedly took a lie detector test... Allegedly!
[00:54:42.792 --> 00:54:46.155]  ...by an employee of the National... Polygraphs are fake!
[00:54:46.155 --> 00:54:46.936]  ...at which point in time...
[00:54:47.296 --> 00:54:57.399]  When you say different than another time, were there other women paid sexual hush money by Donald Trump or his organization?
[00:54:57.399 --> 00:54:59.480]  Was this a standard operating practice?
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:00.180]  No.
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.601]  So you're not aware of any other cases where it had taken place?
[00:55:02.601 --> 00:55:05.862]  I'm not aware of any other case that Mr. Trump paid.
[00:55:05.862 --> 00:55:07.863]  So which brings us to the Karen McDougal.
[00:55:07.863 --> 00:55:09.863]  He was supposed to pay.
[00:55:09.863 --> 00:55:11.924]  He was supposed to pay $125,000 for the life story of
[00:55:14.485 --> 00:55:15.626]  We got him!
[00:55:15.626 --> 00:55:17.287]  We got President Trump!
[00:55:17.287 --> 00:55:19.508]  He had a relationship with a Playboy model!
[00:55:19.508 --> 00:55:20.829]  We got him!
[00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:21.910]  Impeach!
[00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:22.350]  Impeach!
[00:55:44.986 --> 00:55:52.326]  Maybe not in the immediate aftermath, but in the second tremor, in the second wave.
[00:55:53.515 --> 00:55:59.797]  Are you aware of any videotapes that may be the subject of extortion or blackmail?
[00:55:59.797 --> 00:56:01.817]  I've heard about these tapes for a long time.
[00:56:01.817 --> 00:56:05.398]  I've had many people contact me over the years.
[00:56:05.398 --> 00:56:08.779]  I have no reason to believe that that tape exists.
[00:56:08.779 --> 00:56:17.661]  In December 2015, Donald Trump was asked about his relationship with Felix Sater, a convicted felon and real estate developer, and he replied, Felix Sater, boy, have to even think about it.
[00:56:17.661 --> 00:56:18.842]  I'm not that familiar with him.
[00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:25.495]  Why did Trump endeavor to hide his relationship with Felix Sater and what was his relationship?
[00:56:26.206 --> 00:56:28.067]  Well, he certainly had a relationship.
[00:56:28.067 --> 00:56:42.237]  Felix was a partner in a company called Bayrock that was involved in the deal of the Trump Soho Hotel, as well as, I believe, the Trump Fort Lauderdale project.
[00:56:42.237 --> 00:56:44.098]  Why did he want to distance himself?
[00:56:44.098 --> 00:56:45.459]  That's what Mr. Trump does.
[00:56:45.459 --> 00:56:50.583]  He distances himself when things go bad for someone.
[00:56:50.583 --> 00:56:53.185]  And at that point in time, it was going bad for Mr. Sater.
[00:56:54.984 --> 00:57:03.070]  You said you lied to Congress about Trump's negotiations to build his Moscow Tower because he made it clear to you that he wanted you to lie.
[00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:11.996]  One of the reasons you... Alright, ladies and gentlemen, you know, I don't know, maybe we stick with this lie.
[00:57:11.996 --> 00:57:16.239]  It's just, it's so ridiculous.
[00:57:16.239 --> 00:57:17.640]  Everybody knows what's going on here.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.922]  And this is totally going to fail the Democrats.
[00:57:22.755 --> 00:57:24.096]  But see, it's not even about that.
[00:57:24.096 --> 00:57:27.659]  It's all about getting little sound bites.
[00:57:27.659 --> 00:57:35.326]  It's all about getting little clips and little hot shots to then write stories and then, you know, perpetuate a narrative.
[00:57:35.326 --> 00:57:42.492]  But I'm telling you, even if everything that they're saying about Trump is true today, this is only going to help Trump.
[00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:44.994]  The American people are sick of you!
[00:57:44.994 --> 00:57:45.855]  They hate you!
[00:57:45.855 --> 00:57:46.876]  That's what they're sick of!
[00:57:46.876 --> 00:57:47.777]  It's not even about Trump!
[00:57:58.581 --> 00:58:07.605]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:58:07.605 --> 00:58:17.670]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[00:58:29.535 --> 00:58:31.635]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:58:31.635 --> 00:58:36.537]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:58:36.537 --> 00:58:38.057]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:58:38.057 --> 00:58:39.538]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:58:39.538 --> 00:58:46.219]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[00:59:53.788 --> 00:59:56.509]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:13.288 --> 01:00:20.053]  There's an interesting aspect of this that most people don't realize.
[01:00:20.053 --> 01:00:28.220]  And in fact, I'm telling you, I'm even wondering if Trump has realized this or had realized this.
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:35.325]  But at a certain level, this is not even about Donald Trump and never was.
[01:00:35.325 --> 01:00:38.088]  It was about America coming back to life.
[01:00:38.088 --> 01:00:39.469]  It was about the American people
[01:00:40.379 --> 01:00:47.781]  Getting sick of being pushed around by media, by politicians, by corruption, and just standing idly by.
[01:00:47.781 --> 01:00:57.083]  And so this whole thing has been festering like a dormant volcano for a long time, but the magma's been boiling and everything.
[01:00:57.083 --> 01:01:01.624]  And whether Trump is even aware of it or not, he became the rock
[01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:13.632]  That penetrated the surface, that then allowed all the lava to flow out and explode.
[01:01:13.632 --> 01:01:18.317]  And so, they can destroy Donald Trump.
[01:01:18.317 --> 01:01:21.240]  They can have this testimony to attempt to destroy Donald Trump.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.562]  They can have the media make things up to try to destroy Donald Trump.
[01:01:23.562 --> 01:01:27.186]  All of this stuff, maybe it's true, maybe it's not.
[01:01:27.186 --> 01:01:28.067]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:01:29.133 --> 01:01:34.296]  Because the volcano has already exploded.
[01:01:34.296 --> 01:01:36.717]  The lava is already flowing.
[01:01:36.717 --> 01:01:45.502]  They want to put the lid back on the volcano, but they don't understand they're only heating it up.
[01:01:45.502 --> 01:01:54.407]  And so, I don't know what the immediate blowback from this is going to be, but I can tell you in the long run, this is only going to help Donald Trump.
[01:01:55.405 --> 01:01:59.268]  And it's only going to enrage the American people.
[01:01:59.268 --> 01:02:03.111]  This is the crap that the American people are sick of.
[01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:08.855]  This is exactly why Donald Trump got elected, but they don't get it yet.
[01:02:08.855 --> 01:02:17.321]  So the more that they continue to not understand that, which, I mean, it's like I don't even want to tell them this, but the more they do this,
[01:02:19.434 --> 01:02:28.764]  The more they mitigate themselves into oblivion, the more they cast the light on themselves as the enemy.
[01:02:28.764 --> 01:02:30.586]  So let's go back.
[01:02:30.586 --> 01:02:31.668]  Now, Mark Meadows.
[01:02:34.474 --> 01:02:37.558]  Inquiring testimony here from Michael Cohen the Rat.
[01:02:37.558 --> 01:02:39.300]  Was it my what?
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:53.637]  Were you advised or was your counsel advised to withhold your written testimony to this committee at the latest possible date to get it to this committee at the latest possible date as John Dean said that he advised you?
[01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:55.419]  Yes or no?
[01:02:55.419 --> 01:02:56.259]  No.
[01:02:56.259 --> 01:02:57.680]  He never advised you.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.741]  John Dean?
[01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:00.062]  I've never spoken with John Dean.
[01:03:00.062 --> 01:03:02.403]  Has he spoken to your attorney?
[01:03:02.403 --> 01:03:02.784]  I don't know.
[01:03:02.784 --> 01:03:03.644]  I've never spoken with John Dean.
[01:03:03.644 --> 01:03:05.725]  Well, ask your attorneys right there behind you.
[01:03:05.725 --> 01:03:08.287]  We were working last night until 11, 12 o'clock at night.
[01:03:08.287 --> 01:03:10.949]  You've known that you've been coming for some time.
[01:03:10.949 --> 01:03:12.770]  You may answer the question.
[01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:15.132]  Answer the question.
[01:03:15.132 --> 01:03:19.835]  We were working until 11, 12 o'clock last night to finish everything.
[01:03:19.835 --> 01:03:22.196]  So you were riding it last night, Mr. Cohen?
[01:03:22.196 --> 01:03:23.397]  Don't give me that bull.
[01:03:24.625 --> 01:03:28.788]  We were making edits all the way through the night.
[01:03:28.788 --> 01:03:29.208]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:29.208 --> 01:03:31.250]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.891]  Mr. Cohen.
[01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:32.871]  So didn't answer the question.
[01:03:32.871 --> 01:03:33.812]  November 2013.
[01:03:33.812 --> 01:03:39.316]  And of course, Mr. Cummings is not going to make him answer the question.
[01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:41.218]  They're all working together on this deal.
[01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:43.920]  Trump International Hotel and Tower in Fort Lauderdale.
[01:03:44.662 --> 01:04:01.360]  During the deposition, President Trump was asked about his knowledge of Felix Sater, a Russian-born real estate developer and convicted member of the Russian Mafia, who, according to press reports, pled guilty for his role in a $40 million stock manipulation scheme.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.946]  And it's worth noting, as well publicized, the direct relationship between the Russian Mafia and the Kremlin.
[01:04:07.566 --> 01:04:11.388]  This is, folks, the floodgates are getting ready to open on this deal.
[01:04:11.388 --> 01:04:15.209]  This is unbelievable.
[01:04:15.209 --> 01:04:19.411]  You know, I gotta tell you, take it down.
[01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:30.536]  I gotta tell you here, folks, look, I don't agree with everything President Trump does, but I understand the overall dynamics, 90% of which I talk about on air.
[01:04:31.627 --> 01:04:34.469]  But let me tell you something.
[01:04:34.469 --> 01:04:42.092]  This is just going to open the floodgates against these people if they actually remove Trump from office for this.
[01:04:42.092 --> 01:04:51.297]  I'm telling you, if Donald Trump is the vicious con man they claim he is, he is going to come back after them with total vengeance.
[01:04:51.297 --> 01:04:54.699]  And paying for a portrait is peanuts compared to what these people have done.
[01:04:54.699 --> 01:04:56.280]  I mean, it's beautiful.
[01:04:58.479 --> 01:04:58.999]  It's simple.
[01:04:58.999 --> 01:05:05.101]  If you want to beat the globalists, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:07.581]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:05:07.581 --> 01:05:11.222]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late-term abortion and all great it is.
[01:05:11.222 --> 01:05:13.983]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:05:13.983 --> 01:05:15.163]  What is the top tumor?
[01:05:15.163 --> 01:05:17.204]  It's a bestseller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:05:17.204 --> 01:05:19.124]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[01:05:19.244 --> 01:05:20.304]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[01:05:20.304 --> 01:05:22.245]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:05:22.245 --> 01:05:25.966]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:05:25.966 --> 01:05:29.007]  I'm like, uh, what's the highest you could do a month later?
[01:05:29.007 --> 01:05:29.268]  Uh, 90, 95%.
[01:05:29.268 --> 01:05:30.708]  No one's ever done it.
[01:05:30.708 --> 01:05:32.629]  I said, how much does that cost per bottle?
[01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:33.569]  It costs $10.
[01:05:33.569 --> 01:05:35.070]  No one's ever done that.
[01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:37.791]  Sir, the average competitor is 3 to 5%.
[01:05:37.791 --> 01:05:38.571]  The top brand's 50%.
[01:05:38.571 --> 01:05:40.472]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:05:41.752 --> 01:05:44.695]  I mean, you understand why that's, like, our information's explosive?
[01:05:44.695 --> 01:05:45.296]  Our fish oil.
[01:05:45.296 --> 01:05:47.819]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[01:05:47.819 --> 01:05:48.900]  My children take it.
[01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:53.225]  You think I'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:05:53.225 --> 01:05:56.248]  You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[01:05:56.248 --> 01:05:56.549]  Never!
[01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:14.435]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:14.435 --> 01:06:19.137]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:19.137 --> 01:06:27.663]  Alright, we've got so much stuff coming up, I'm trying to war game it all out in my head right now, but we've got...
[01:06:29.088 --> 01:06:31.430]  Exclusive Robert Barnes content coming up.
[01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:39.676]  The amazing attorney representing the Covington Catholic Boys with the libel, slander, and defamation that they've had to endure.
[01:06:39.676 --> 01:06:42.118]  The harassment from the mainstream media.
[01:06:42.118 --> 01:06:43.780]  We got three powerful segments with him.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:50.265]  We're going to be joined by James O'Keefe at the end of this hour at 1250 here Central.
[01:06:50.265 --> 01:06:51.966]  So in 45 minutes, or excuse me, in 35 minutes.
[01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:52.406]  I guess it is 45 minutes.
[01:06:58.092 --> 01:07:00.075]  That's going to be huge.
[01:07:00.075 --> 01:07:06.124]  The amazing James O'Keefe from Project Veritas, they have just released a new video exposing Facebook.
[01:07:06.124 --> 01:07:08.448]  But folks, you need to hear this.
[01:07:09.503 --> 01:07:13.785]  As Michael Cohen is testifying right now live.
[01:07:13.785 --> 01:07:16.486]  We may go back to it, we may not.
[01:07:16.486 --> 01:07:17.347]  We know what it is, folks.
[01:07:17.347 --> 01:07:18.648]  There's other important stuff we've got to get to.
[01:07:18.648 --> 01:07:21.309]  But here is, they're not going to show you this, folks.
[01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:23.330]  They're not going to show you this on the national news here.
[01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:25.051]  They're not going to show you this on cable TV.
[01:07:25.051 --> 01:07:31.514]  But here is Michael Cohen's real opening statement today in front of Congress.
[01:07:33.319 --> 01:07:36.681]  Now I want to tell you about the real Donald Trump.
[01:07:36.681 --> 01:07:44.806]  The man who I have been fortunate enough to work for and to stand by shoulder to shoulder for a decade.
[01:07:44.806 --> 01:07:59.094]  The words the media should be using to describe Mr. Trump are generous, compassionate, principled, empathetic, kind, humble, honest, and genuine.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.640]  So there you go!
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.021]  Michael Cohen's opening remarks on President Trump today.
[01:08:06.021 --> 01:08:07.182]  Wow!
[01:08:07.182 --> 01:08:09.282]  Very endearing words there.
[01:08:09.282 --> 01:08:10.142]  Amazing stuff.
[01:08:10.142 --> 01:08:12.143]  All right.
[01:08:12.143 --> 01:08:15.103]  Let me get to some of these clips.
[01:08:15.103 --> 01:08:25.346]  Boy, you know, I want to play the whole Elijah Cummings opening statement, which is more than 10 minutes.
[01:08:25.346 --> 01:08:28.126]  I think it was 14 minutes overall.
[01:08:28.126 --> 01:08:29.807]  And then he cut Jim Jordan off at four.
[01:08:31.332 --> 01:08:37.715]  And this guy's such a... I just don't even know if we'll have time.
[01:08:37.715 --> 01:08:41.196]  I mean, it's just... Alright, let's go to clip seven.
[01:08:41.196 --> 01:08:46.938]  Here's Jim Jordan grilling Michael Cohen.
[01:08:46.938 --> 01:08:57.283]  When I meet one day while we're in the courthouse, and I will take you for every penny you still don't have, and I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know.
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:05.323]  So I'm warning you, tread very effing lightly, because what I'm going to do to you is going to be effing disgusting.
[01:09:05.323 --> 01:09:07.243]  You understand me?
[01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:08.884]  Mr. Cohen, who said that?
[01:09:08.884 --> 01:09:10.524]  I did.
[01:09:10.524 --> 01:09:15.726]  And did you say that, Mr. Cohen, in your testimony on page two?
[01:09:15.726 --> 01:09:20.248]  You said you did things for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect him.
[01:09:20.248 --> 01:09:25.830]  Was that statement that I just read that you admitted to saying, did you do that to protect Donald Trump?
[01:09:27.273 --> 01:09:33.179]  I did it to protect Mr. Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump.
[01:09:35.031 --> 01:09:48.841]  And in your sentencing statement back in December in front of the judge, you said this, Mr. Cohen, my weakness can be characterized as a blind loyalty to Donald Trump, a blind loyalty that led me to choose a path of darkness.
[01:09:48.841 --> 01:09:50.402]  Is that accurate, Mr. Cohen?
[01:09:50.402 --> 01:09:51.323]  I wrote that.
[01:09:51.323 --> 01:09:53.545]  You wrote that and said that in front of the judge.
[01:09:53.545 --> 01:09:54.245]  Is that right?
[01:09:54.245 --> 01:09:54.966]  That's correct.
[01:09:54.966 --> 01:09:56.307]  Let me read a few other things here.
[01:09:56.307 --> 01:09:57.447]  And let me ask you.
[01:09:58.479 --> 01:09:59.680]  Why you did some of these things.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:11.888]  When you filed a false tax return in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, was all that out of blind loyalty to the President?
[01:10:11.888 --> 01:10:13.669]  No, it was not.
[01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:22.415]  When you failed to report $4 million in income to the Internal Revenue Service, did you do that to protect Donald Trump?
[01:10:22.415 --> 01:10:23.716]  No, I did not.
[01:10:23.716 --> 01:10:25.337]  And when you failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes,
[01:10:28.257 --> 01:10:30.259]  I got constituents who don't make that in a lifetime.
[01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:36.884]  When you failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes to the US Treasury, was that out of some...
[01:10:37.506 --> 01:10:40.848]  Blind loyalty to the President of the United States?
[01:10:40.848 --> 01:10:41.569]  It was not.
[01:10:41.569 --> 01:10:44.891]  But the number was 1.38 and change.
[01:10:44.891 --> 01:10:48.294]  And I have paid that money back to the IRS.
[01:10:48.294 --> 01:10:50.475]  I think the American people will appreciate that 1.38.
[01:10:50.475 --> 01:10:55.619]  And I would also just like to say it was over a course of five years.
[01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:56.360]  Approximately $260,000 a year.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.801]  And that's what I said 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, that's five years?
[01:10:58.801 --> 01:10:58.942]  Yes.
[01:10:58.942 --> 01:10:59.122]  Got it.
[01:10:59.122 --> 01:10:59.942]  When you made false statements,
[01:11:06.567 --> 01:11:14.792]  To financial institutions concerning a home equity line of credit, taxi medallions, and your Park Avenue apartment in 2013, 2014, and 2015.
[01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:19.315]  You pled guilty to making those false statements to those banks.
[01:11:19.315 --> 01:11:23.117]  Was that all done to protect the President?
[01:11:23.117 --> 01:11:24.598]  No, it was not.
[01:11:24.598 --> 01:11:26.359]  How about this one?
[01:11:26.359 --> 01:11:32.984]  When you created the fake Twitter accounts, Women for Cohen, and paid a firm to post tweets like this one.
[01:11:33.976 --> 01:11:47.246]  In a world of lies, deception, and fraud, we appreciate this honest guy, at Michael Cohen, hashtag TGIF, hashtag handsome, hashtag sexy.
[01:11:47.246 --> 01:11:49.268]  Was that done to protect the president?
[01:11:49.268 --> 01:11:51.570]  Mr. Jordan, I didn't actually set that up.
[01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:54.912]  It was done by a young lady that worked for Red Finch.
[01:11:54.912 --> 01:12:01.677]  And during the course of the campaign, which you would know gets somewhat crazy and wild, we were having fun.
[01:12:02.498 --> 01:12:03.599]  That's what it was, sir.
[01:12:03.599 --> 01:12:04.900]  We were having fun.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.662]  Was it done to protect the President?
[01:12:06.662 --> 01:12:08.383]  That was not done to protect the President.
[01:12:08.383 --> 01:12:09.464]  Was it a fake Twitter account?
[01:12:09.464 --> 01:12:12.106]  That was... No, that was a real Twitter account.
[01:12:12.106 --> 01:12:12.387]  It exists.
[01:12:12.387 --> 01:12:14.468]  Did you pay a firm to create this account?
[01:12:14.468 --> 01:12:15.749]  I didn't pay the firm to do that.
[01:12:15.749 --> 01:12:18.372]  It was done by a young lady that works for the firm.
[01:12:18.372 --> 01:12:22.996]  And again, sir, we were having fun during a stressful time.
[01:12:22.996 --> 01:12:27.319]  The point is, Mr. Cohen, did you lie to protect the President or did you lie to help yourself?
[01:12:27.319 --> 01:12:28.621]  I'm not sure how that helped me, sir.
[01:12:29.437 --> 01:12:30.838]  I'm not sure how it did either.
[01:12:30.838 --> 01:12:31.898]  Right.
[01:12:31.898 --> 01:12:35.841]  And I would like to note that more than half the people on that site are men.
[01:12:35.841 --> 01:12:36.981]  Here's the point.
[01:12:36.981 --> 01:12:45.426]  The chairman just gave you a 30-minute opening statement, and you have a history of lying over and over and over again.
[01:12:45.426 --> 01:12:48.588]  And frankly, don't take my word for it.
[01:12:48.588 --> 01:12:49.609]  Take what the court said.
[01:12:49.609 --> 01:12:51.169]  Take what the Southern District of New York said.
[01:12:54.346 --> 01:13:00.771]  Did crimes that were marked by a pattern of deception and that permeated his professional life.
[01:13:00.771 --> 01:13:05.634]  These crimes were distinct in their harms but bear a common set of circumstances.
[01:13:05.634 --> 01:13:12.999]  They each involved deception and were each each motivated by personal greed and ambition.
[01:13:12.999 --> 01:13:22.146]  A pattern of deception for personal greed and ambition and you just got 30 minutes of an opening statement where you trash the President of the United States of America.
[01:13:22.146 --> 01:13:23.187]  Mr. Cohen, how long did
[01:13:24.104 --> 01:13:26.585]  How long did you work for Donald Trump?
[01:13:26.585 --> 01:13:28.585]  Approximately a decade.
[01:13:28.585 --> 01:13:29.186]  10 years?
[01:13:29.186 --> 01:13:31.366]  That's correct.
[01:13:31.366 --> 01:13:38.188]  You said all these bad things about the President there in that last 30 minutes, and yet you worked for him for 10 years?
[01:13:38.188 --> 01:13:49.092]  All those bad things, I mean, it's that bad, I can see you working for him for 10 days, maybe 10 weeks, maybe even 10 months, but you worked for him for 10 years!
[01:13:51.547 --> 01:13:55.269]  Mr. Cohen, how long did you work in the White House?
[01:13:55.269 --> 01:13:56.810]  I never worked in the White House.
[01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:58.310]  That's the point, isn't it, Mr. Cohen?
[01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.851]  No, sir.
[01:13:58.851 --> 01:13:59.591]  Yes, it is.
[01:13:59.591 --> 01:14:00.251]  No, it's not, sir.
[01:14:00.251 --> 01:14:01.792]  You wanted to work in the White House.
[01:14:01.792 --> 01:14:02.192]  No, sir.
[01:14:02.192 --> 01:14:03.613]  You didn't get brought to the dance.
[01:14:03.613 --> 01:14:03.753]  Sir.
[01:14:03.753 --> 01:14:04.453]  And now?
[01:14:04.453 --> 01:14:12.037]  I was extremely proud to be personal attorney to the President of the United States of America.
[01:14:12.037 --> 01:14:14.458]  I did not want to go to the White House.
[01:14:14.458 --> 01:14:15.819]  I was offered jobs
[01:14:16.599 --> 01:14:28.846]  I can tell you a story of Mr. Trump reaming out Reince Priebus because I had not taken a job where Mr. Trump wanted me to, which is working with Don McGahn at the White House General Counsel's Office.
[01:14:31.872 --> 01:14:46.732]  What I said at the time and I brought a lawyer in who produced a memo as to why I should not go in because there would be no attorney-client privilege and in order to handle some of the matters that I talked about in my opening.
[01:14:47.677 --> 01:14:54.101]  That it would be best suited for me not to go in and that every president had a personal attorney.
[01:14:54.101 --> 01:14:55.562]  Here's what I see.
[01:14:55.562 --> 01:14:59.824]  I see a guy who worked for 10 years and is here trashing the guy he worked for for 10 years.
[01:14:59.824 --> 01:15:02.286]  Didn't get a job in the White House and now?
[01:15:03.206 --> 01:15:08.028]  And now you're behaving just like everyone else who's got fired or didn't get the job they wanted.
[01:15:08.028 --> 01:15:09.489]  Like Andy McCabe.
[01:15:09.489 --> 01:15:10.889]  Like James Comey.
[01:15:10.889 --> 01:15:14.811]  Same kind of selfish motivation after you don't get the thing you want.
[01:15:14.811 --> 01:15:20.293]  That's what I see here today and I think that's what the American people... Mr. Jordan, all I wanted was what I got.
[01:15:20.293 --> 01:15:22.554]  To be personal attorney to the president.
[01:15:22.554 --> 01:15:30.957]  To enjoy the senior year of my son in high school and waiting for my daughter who's graduating from college to come back to New York.
[01:15:30.957 --> 01:15:32.498]  I got exactly what I want.
[01:15:34.410 --> 01:15:35.971]  Exactly what you want, but I want it.
[01:15:35.971 --> 01:15:37.331]  That's right.
[01:15:37.331 --> 01:15:40.252]  I received exactly what I wanted.
[01:15:40.252 --> 01:15:47.195]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, when we come back, we're going to have more from the Cohen hearing.
[01:15:47.195 --> 01:15:48.395]  We're wargaming all this out.
[01:15:48.395 --> 01:15:51.756]  We got so much content to get to, including James O'Keefe coming up.
[01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:52.537]  It's just epic.
[01:15:52.537 --> 01:15:54.938]  And then there's just there's more stuff coming.
[01:15:54.938 --> 01:15:55.678]  It's crazy out there.
[01:15:57.536 --> 01:15:58.796]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.796 --> 01:16:00.097]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:03.838]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.838 --> 01:16:04.918]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.918 --> 01:16:06.739]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.739 --> 01:16:08.439]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:27.188 --> 01:16:33.832]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[01:16:33.832 --> 01:16:38.535]  Did you know the official national American flag has never been manufactured for retail stores?
[01:16:38.535 --> 01:16:40.836]  The one that Americans fought and died for.
[01:16:40.836 --> 01:16:43.638]  The one symbol that represents our Constitution.
[01:16:43.638 --> 01:16:47.080]  Now you can be a part of this great movement that's never been seen before.
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.381]  Together we'll recapture America.

[01:16:57.186 --> 01:17:01.049]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:06.052]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.202]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:17:27.106 --> 01:17:28.347]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:28.347 --> 01:17:32.269]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.269 --> 01:17:33.789]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:33.789 --> 01:17:36.751]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:36.751 --> 01:17:42.313]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:42.313 --> 01:17:43.514]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:43.514 --> 01:17:46.455]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:46.455 --> 01:17:48.676]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:48.676 --> 01:17:53.118]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:17:53.118 --> 01:17:55.440]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:18:07.591 --> 01:18:16.615]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:18:16.615 --> 01:18:26.680]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:35.205]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:37.386]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:18:37.386 --> 01:18:38.547]  You must experience it.
[01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:45.554]  It is a total game-changer when it comes to easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.075]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:18:47.075 --> 01:18:48.556]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:18:48.556 --> 01:18:55.242]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:18:55.242 --> 01:18:56.203]  TurboForce at m4slife.com.
[01:18:58.294 --> 01:19:01.736]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:19:01.736 --> 01:19:05.519]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:19:05.519 --> 01:19:11.803]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:19:11.803 --> 01:19:14.585]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:19:15.305 --> 01:19:19.128]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:19:19.128 --> 01:19:25.594]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:30.558]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:19:31.317 --> 01:19:35.239]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:19:35.239 --> 01:19:42.423]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:19:42.423 --> 01:19:47.666]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:19:47.666 --> 01:19:53.349]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:19:53.349 --> 01:19:57.311]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:20:01.278 --> 01:20:16.244]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:18.085]  Boy, it's a good haul today, isn't it?
[01:20:18.085 --> 01:20:22.847]  It's a good haul of news today, isn't it?
[01:20:22.847 --> 01:20:24.848]  Quite a haul of news today.
[01:20:31.101 --> 01:20:35.883]  I feel like I should have like a giant head of hair that's like neon green.
[01:20:35.883 --> 01:20:39.184]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:20:39.184 --> 01:20:43.446]  Like a big neon green head of hair here.
[01:20:43.446 --> 01:20:44.946]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:44.946 --> 01:20:47.267]  Folks, Alex Jones is coming up.
[01:20:47.267 --> 01:20:54.710]  He is in a secret location on a secret mission right now.
[01:20:54.710 --> 01:20:57.151]  And I am not at liberty to discuss
[01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:04.814]  Where or why Alex Jones is doing what he's doing right now?
[01:21:04.814 --> 01:21:12.724]  But you will find out before the end of the Alex Jones Show today.
[01:21:12.724 --> 01:21:14.325]  And it is epic.
[01:21:14.325 --> 01:21:17.189]  And it could break the internet.
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:26.906]  Now, right now, the big story is the Michael Cohen testimony, where we're gonna go back live, we just can't help it, folks.
[01:21:26.906 --> 01:21:33.191]  It's just like crack or something, like political crack, when the media builds something like this up.
[01:21:33.191 --> 01:21:39.656]  But it's the necessity to provide the counter-narrative to all the BS.
[01:21:39.656 --> 01:21:46.782]  And then there's another level, too, where it's events like this that change people's perspective
[01:21:47.970 --> 01:22:03.062]  Because they see the whole circus of the Cohen testimony, and then they see the media response to it, and it draws a reaction.
[01:22:03.062 --> 01:22:07.286]  And for many people, the reaction might be, huh.
[01:22:07.286 --> 01:22:08.066]  This is odd.
[01:22:08.066 --> 01:22:10.248]  Something doesn't add up here.
[01:22:10.248 --> 01:22:12.390]  And so they try to outsource
[01:22:14.068 --> 01:22:21.074]  For information or for opinion and they wind up at Infowars and they see our covers and they're like, wow, these guys actually make some sense.
[01:22:21.074 --> 01:22:24.356]  That's what I was thinking about that scumbag.
[01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:32.743]  That's what I was thinking about Raskin from New Jersey who, I mean, literally looks like a drowned rat.
[01:22:32.743 --> 01:22:39.268]  That's what I was thinking about Elijah Cummings when he lied today.
[01:22:39.268 --> 01:22:40.229]  We'll tell it like it is.
[01:22:41.966 --> 01:22:46.189]  And that's why they want us banned and censored.
[01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:52.435]  I mean, let's just go ahead and look at what has happened to Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:22:52.435 --> 01:22:54.656]  Totally banned off all platforms.
[01:22:54.656 --> 01:22:56.798]  I actually set a record.
[01:22:56.798 --> 01:23:04.604]  I challenge anybody to claim that they got a quicker ban on Facebook than me.
[01:23:04.604 --> 01:23:07.707]  I was on Facebook for 14 hours and they banned me.
[01:23:10.438 --> 01:23:13.521]  Do you know what the reason they gave me was?
[01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:17.105]  None.
[01:23:17.105 --> 01:23:19.207]  So I'm not allowed, I'm not allowed to exist.
[01:23:19.207 --> 01:23:20.549]  I cannot have a YouTube account.
[01:23:20.549 --> 01:23:22.471]  I cannot have a Facebook account.
[01:23:22.471 --> 01:23:24.353]  Totally banned.
[01:23:24.353 --> 01:23:25.834]  Still on Twitter.
[01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.896]  Maybe Jack Dorsey, a fellow of St.
[01:23:27.896 --> 01:23:28.977]  Louis and allows me on Twitter.
[01:23:28.977 --> 01:23:29.858]  Because I'm from St.
[01:23:29.858 --> 01:23:30.299]  Louis.
[01:23:30.299 --> 01:23:30.619]  Maybe.
[01:23:30.619 --> 01:23:31.941]  I don't know.
[01:23:31.941 --> 01:23:32.121]  But!
[01:23:33.755 --> 01:23:34.936]  That's what we deal with.
[01:23:34.936 --> 01:23:37.818]  So it's impossible for us.
[01:23:37.818 --> 01:23:44.244]  See, this is really the key here, because there's all sorts of different solutions and ways we can still get our content out.
[01:23:44.244 --> 01:23:47.347]  It obviously shrinks us and contracts us.
[01:23:47.347 --> 01:23:48.528]  But see, here's what it is.
[01:23:48.528 --> 01:23:51.971]  Like, right now, this is why they want us banned, folks.
[01:23:52.992 --> 01:23:56.474]  Right now, everyone is tuned in to this Michael Cohen thing.
[01:23:56.474 --> 01:23:58.235]  It's got the nation's attention.
[01:23:58.235 --> 01:24:01.897]  So there's people, young people, old people, all kinds of people.
[01:24:01.897 --> 01:24:02.637]  They're on the internet.
[01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:03.618]  They're searching on YouTube.
[01:24:03.618 --> 01:24:04.578]  They're searching on Facebook.
[01:24:04.578 --> 01:24:05.759]  They're searching on Twitter.
[01:24:05.759 --> 01:24:09.041]  Michael Cohen testimony, Michael Cohen testimony, Michael Cohen testimony.
[01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:10.702]  And so all of these live streams are popping up.
[01:24:10.702 --> 01:24:11.582]  They want to see the live streams.
[01:24:11.582 --> 01:24:12.643]  They want to see the live streams.
[01:24:12.643 --> 01:24:19.727]  Well, it used to be InfoWars, the Alex Jones channel, all of our pages, we'd be right up there at the top.
[01:24:19.727 --> 01:24:21.208]  Because we were at the front.
[01:24:22.173 --> 01:24:25.114]  Of cutting edge news on the internet.
[01:24:25.114 --> 01:24:26.774]  I mean, we are the frontier.
[01:24:26.774 --> 01:24:30.355]  We are the Millennium Falcon.
[01:24:30.355 --> 01:24:36.996]  We are the X-Wing fighter in the crevices of the Death Star.
[01:24:36.996 --> 01:24:39.397]  And we're firing, and we're hitting the target.
[01:24:39.397 --> 01:24:40.937]  And so that's why they have to erase us.
[01:24:40.937 --> 01:24:43.698]  So now, instead of InfoWars, this broadcast,
[01:24:44.557 --> 01:24:58.364]  Being live on YouTube, live on Facebook, live on Twitter with all the hashtags and Michael Cohen with thousands if not millions of eyes, perhaps even new eyes, on us, giving you the best coverage of this, we're no longer allowed to exist.
[01:24:58.364 --> 01:24:59.385]  And that's why.
[01:24:59.385 --> 01:25:10.791]  Because when news breaks, when there's a viral story happening, they don't want us in the arena.
[01:25:10.791 --> 01:25:12.072]  And so that's why we get banned.
[01:25:13.885 --> 01:25:21.591]  And how fitting is it that I'm allowed to do one live video post on Facebook called, Is Free Speech Dead in America?
[01:25:21.591 --> 01:25:24.213]  And then they ban me.
[01:25:24.213 --> 01:25:27.156]  So folks, this is why your support at InfoWarsTore.com is so important.
[01:25:27.156 --> 01:25:43.229]  Now, whether it's the brand new protein bars, which are 40% off right now when you order two or more boxes, whether it's the Turbo Force that is 33% off right now at InfoWarsTore.com, whether it's the bodies that's 50% off right now at InfoWarsTore.com,
[01:25:44.358 --> 01:25:49.201]  Our products get rave reviews because they're great.
[01:25:49.201 --> 01:25:52.204]  And because they're products you need.
[01:25:52.204 --> 01:25:55.866]  People use turmeric for all kinds of different purposes.
[01:25:55.866 --> 01:26:03.712]  So we just decided we're gonna go out and get the best turmeric and put as much of it into one capsule as possible.
[01:26:03.712 --> 01:26:05.853]  And that's bodies.
[01:26:05.853 --> 01:26:07.474]  Just read the reviews for yourself.
[01:26:07.474 --> 01:26:10.717]  I can't tell you how many calls I get, how many people I meet on the street,
[01:26:11.650 --> 01:26:17.595]  They're telling me how much they love bodies from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:26:17.595 --> 01:26:26.423]  If you're not into supplements, we have household items like toothpaste, super blue fluoride free toothpaste, or the bubblegum flavor that we have for children.
[01:26:26.423 --> 01:26:28.124]  Do you brush your teeth?
[01:26:28.124 --> 01:26:29.085]  I hope so.
[01:26:29.085 --> 01:26:31.187]  Okay, well shop with the good guys at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:26:31.187 --> 01:26:32.348]  We've got great toothpaste.
[01:26:32.348 --> 01:26:33.229]  We've got toothbrushes.
[01:26:34.855 --> 01:26:38.318]  We've got shampoo, body wash, sunscreen.
[01:26:38.318 --> 01:26:41.440]  It's all at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.902]  Air filters, water filters.
[01:26:43.902 --> 01:26:45.323]  Don't be ignorant.
[01:26:45.323 --> 01:26:49.886]  Go look at all of the toxins that are in the tap water.
[01:26:49.886 --> 01:27:03.236]  Now, it may not kill ya, but it's definitely not healthy, and you can just do the research for yourself, and that's what I did, and you know what happens when most people do the research on the tap water and all the toxins in there?
[01:27:04.042 --> 01:27:08.463]  They say, hmm, I don't want to drink that.
[01:27:08.463 --> 01:27:12.504]  Why do you think water is more expensive than soda?
[01:27:12.504 --> 01:27:14.285]  Think about that!
[01:27:14.285 --> 01:27:30.929]  I can go out right now and get a fountain soda for 60 cents for a 32-ounce fountain soda, but if I get a 12-ounce bottled water of purified water at that same gas station, it's a dollar.
[01:27:33.643 --> 01:27:37.846]  Because you need water.
[01:27:37.846 --> 01:27:42.730]  And the reason why people drink purified water is because the tap water is disgusting.
[01:27:42.730 --> 01:27:51.357]  So we just figure, hey, quit paying a buck for a 12 ounce bottled water and get your own bottled water source at your house.
[01:27:53.049 --> 01:27:55.251]  With the water filters that we sell.
[01:27:55.251 --> 01:27:56.011]  So that's what we do.
[01:27:56.011 --> 01:28:01.575]  We provide solutions to the problems that we face in our daily lives that we look for solutions for.
[01:28:01.575 --> 01:28:05.238]  Hey, the water that comes out of the tap is not clean.
[01:28:05.238 --> 01:28:06.899]  I should get a water filter.

[01:28:09.661 --> 01:28:17.026]  Hey, there's a new study out, which is a follow-up to other previous studies that say the air quality in the average American home is totally polluted.
[01:28:17.026 --> 01:28:19.888]  In fact, it's just as polluted as a major metropolitan city.
[01:28:20.888 --> 01:28:25.390]  So we say, man, I don't want to live in a house with polluted air with all these toxins.
[01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:27.731]  I don't want my guests to come over and breathe this polluted air.

[01:28:58.672 --> 01:29:02.593]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.593 --> 01:29:04.133]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:04.133 --> 01:29:07.094]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.094 --> 01:29:12.655]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[01:33:01.321 --> 01:33:03.937]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.668 --> 01:33:24.950]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:28.292]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.292 --> 01:33:32.055]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:32.055 --> 01:33:35.818]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna go back to the Michael Cohen testimony live here.
[01:33:35.818 --> 01:33:38.440]  James O'Keefe is coming up in 20 minutes.
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:41.022]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us.
[01:33:41.022 --> 01:33:44.685]  He's at a secret location on a secret mission right now.
[01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:44.965]  And you know,
[01:33:49.551 --> 01:34:12.930]  I don't really know how to properly explain this but basically it's like it's like the man in the arena is different than the man outside of the arena even though it's the same man and so while it's like I'm in battle mode right now and I'm fired up and I'm and I'm you know trying to be as effective as possible on air whatever that means
[01:34:14.343 --> 01:34:37.062]  But like, at the end of the day, when I'm done with my 10 hours of whatever, trying to figure out what the hell's going on, getting news, getting guests, finding out the latest breaking stuff, finding out other angles, listening to the people I respect, I really do just kind of put everything away and just accept that God is in control.
[01:34:37.062 --> 01:34:43.247]  And if you don't weigh that into the overall factor of everything we're dealing with, then you're not going to understand anything at all.
[01:34:45.287 --> 01:35:00.754]  And so, while I'm watching all of this Cohen stuff and everything, and you want to analyze everything at a very surface level, the stuff that's said here and the stuff that's going to make the news, that's all going to be irrelevant.
[01:35:00.754 --> 01:35:06.556]  The aftershock of this is going to be what impacts America, folks.
[01:35:06.556 --> 01:35:14.280]  So let's go back live, though, now, to this three-ring circus, a total deep state Democrat-run event here, the Cohen testimony.
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:19.565]  Yes, so Mr. Trump has a black speakerphone that sits on his desk.
[01:35:19.565 --> 01:35:22.627]  He uses it quite often because of all the number of phone calls he gets.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:46.409]  Now in January of this year, 2019, the New York Times asked President Trump if he ever spoke to Roger Stone about these stolen emails.
[01:35:46.409 --> 01:35:50.473]  And President Trump answered, and I quote, no I didn't, I never did.
[01:35:51.414 --> 01:35:53.995]  Was that statement by President Trump true?
[01:35:53.995 --> 01:35:55.695]  No, it's not accurate.
[01:35:55.695 --> 01:35:58.896]  And can you please describe for us the best of your recollection?
[01:35:58.896 --> 01:36:00.777]  Now see, this is a big con game.
[01:36:00.777 --> 01:36:04.858]  They gag Roger Stone hours before Cohen lies about him.
[01:36:04.858 --> 01:36:05.638]  See how that works?
[01:36:05.638 --> 01:36:17.042]  It was a short conversation and he said, Mr. Trump, I just want to let you know that I just got off the phone with Julian Assange and in a couple of days there's going to be a massive dump of emails.
[01:36:17.042 --> 01:36:20.983]  That's going to severely hurt the Clinton campaign.
[01:36:21.263 --> 01:36:23.985]  Now look at the precedent they're setting.
[01:36:23.985 --> 01:36:26.406]  So does Anderson Cooper go to jail?
[01:36:26.406 --> 01:36:28.087]  Does Brian Stelter go to jail?
[01:36:28.087 --> 01:36:31.870]  They had phone conversations with Julian Assange too!
[01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:33.631]  Glenn Greenwald?
[01:36:33.631 --> 01:36:35.753]  Oh no, it's only Roger Stone!
[01:36:35.753 --> 01:36:37.854]  If he even did it!
[01:36:37.854 --> 01:36:40.175]  Which they haven't shown any evidence of!
[01:36:40.175 --> 01:36:45.739]  So if Roger Stone did communicate with Julian Assange, he's somehow bad.
[01:36:45.739 --> 01:36:49.762]  But CNN and Glenn Greenwald and everyone else that does it, no big deal!
[01:36:50.742 --> 01:36:51.923]  So that's what I'm saying, see?
[01:36:51.923 --> 01:36:53.285]  But here's what happens, folks.
[01:36:53.285 --> 01:37:03.695]  The news story is... Michael Cohen says that Roger Stone and Donald Trump had direct knowledge from WikiLeaks and Julian Assange that the emails were coming out.
[01:37:03.695 --> 01:37:06.738]  And so that becomes a story, but what's the aftershock?
[01:37:06.738 --> 01:37:09.401]  They're all contacting Assange!
[01:37:09.401 --> 01:37:10.922]  He runs WikiLeaks!
[01:37:10.922 --> 01:37:13.024]  It's an internationally known press!
[01:37:13.024 --> 01:37:13.725]  I mean, so it's like...
[01:37:14.025 --> 01:37:17.748]  Oh, we're all allowed to talk to Assange, but Roger Stone isn't!
[01:37:17.748 --> 01:37:23.953]  And so the American people will eventually equate that factor into it, and that's the aftershock.
[01:37:23.953 --> 01:37:27.916]  And they say, oh, again, you are targeting politically Donald Trump.
[01:37:27.916 --> 01:37:29.457]  That's what this whole thing is about.
[01:37:29.457 --> 01:37:30.638]  It's not about truth.
[01:37:30.638 --> 01:37:31.879]  It's not about justice.
[01:37:31.879 --> 01:37:38.864]  It's about your political witch hunt against Trump, where you're allowed to talk to Wikileaks all day long, but if a Trump associate does it, he's the bad guy.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:50.590]  I'm not in possession, but I believe, again, this is part of the special counsel, and they are probably best suited to corroborate that information.
[01:37:50.590 --> 01:37:54.634]  Was anyone else present in the room during the call?
[01:37:54.634 --> 01:37:55.715]  I don't recall for this one.
[01:37:55.715 --> 01:37:56.295]  No, sir.
[01:37:56.295 --> 01:37:56.776]  No, you don't recall.
[01:37:56.776 --> 01:37:58.157]  Is there anyone else in the committee?
[01:37:58.157 --> 01:37:59.518]  She somehow recalled a phone call, though.
[01:37:59.518 --> 01:38:02.161]  President's knowledge of the WikiLeaks email dump?
[01:38:03.097 --> 01:38:11.620]  Well, um, again, when he called, uh, Rona Graf, uh, yelled out to Mr. Trump, Rogers on line one, which was regular practice.
[01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:12.620]  And that's his assistant?
[01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:13.301]  That's his, yes.
[01:38:13.301 --> 01:38:14.041]  Alright.
[01:38:14.041 --> 01:38:19.883]  And during a news conference on July 27th, 2016, then... And again, guess what?
[01:38:19.883 --> 01:38:23.604]  Rogers not allowed to respond because the judge just gagged him.
[01:38:23.604 --> 01:38:25.325]  Oh, how convenient is that?
[01:38:25.325 --> 01:38:26.966]  Oh, I'm sure that wasn't orchestrated.
[01:38:26.966 --> 01:38:27.006]  No!
[01:38:28.326 --> 01:38:28.766]  No collusion there!
[01:38:28.766 --> 01:38:29.847]  No obstruction of justice there!
[01:38:29.847 --> 01:38:30.387]  I am not.
[01:38:49.352 --> 01:38:53.434]  Call with Mr. Stone, you believe, was before this 27th?
[01:38:53.434 --> 01:38:53.974]  Yes.
[01:38:53.974 --> 01:39:00.878]  I'm sorry, I thought you were talking about a different set of documents that got dumped.
[01:39:00.878 --> 01:39:02.379]  I was in Mr. Trump's office.
[01:39:02.379 --> 01:39:03.860]  But again, see, again, notice...
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:10.162]  They're not denying that the contents of the WikiLeaks emails were fake, were real.
[01:39:10.162 --> 01:39:15.743]  So the emails were real, all the stuff in the emails, Hillary colluding with the media.
[01:39:15.743 --> 01:39:25.146]  Folks, the crimes, the absurdities, the lack of integrity, all of it inside the WikiLeaks emails, nobody talks about that.
[01:39:25.146 --> 01:39:26.426]  Even though they admit it's all real.
[01:39:26.426 --> 01:39:28.026]  Folks, here's the deal.
[01:39:34.628 --> 01:39:38.772]  And this is the big test and I'm telling you, this is not even about Trump.
[01:39:38.772 --> 01:39:39.292]  It is not.
[01:39:39.292 --> 01:39:46.339]  I mean, Trump is just like, Trump is just like the conduit right now for everything.
[01:39:46.339 --> 01:39:48.401]  It's like everything has to go through Trump right now.
[01:39:48.401 --> 01:39:50.723]  But like, it's not even about Trump.
[01:39:51.744 --> 01:39:55.466]  It's about the American people seeing who these frauds are!
[01:39:55.466 --> 01:39:58.687]  Seeing how they've politicized every aspect of the US government!
[01:39:58.687 --> 01:40:03.409]  Seeing how they've politicized all this mainstream national press in this country!
[01:40:03.409 --> 01:40:05.150]  That's what they're sick of!
[01:40:05.150 --> 01:40:09.051]  And the fact that Trump is their target is why we love Trump!
[01:40:09.051 --> 01:40:10.512]  But they don't get it yet!
[01:40:11.516 --> 01:40:12.877]  They don't get it yet!
[01:40:12.877 --> 01:40:20.444]  If these people had a testimony today testifying how dog crap didn't taste good, we'd all start to like dog crap!
[01:40:20.444 --> 01:40:21.445]  Don't you get it?
[01:40:21.445 --> 01:40:22.546]  We're sick of you!
[01:40:22.546 --> 01:40:23.607]  We're sick of you!
[01:40:25.967 --> 01:40:27.688]  We're not sick of Trump!
[01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:28.948]  Trump just got into office.
[01:40:28.948 --> 01:40:29.969]  He's not a politician.
[01:40:29.969 --> 01:40:30.729]  He's a businessman.
[01:40:30.729 --> 01:40:31.809]  He's not perfect.
[01:40:31.809 --> 01:40:33.370]  We didn't elect a perfect man.
[01:40:33.370 --> 01:40:36.311]  We elected somebody that wanted to put the country first.
[01:40:36.311 --> 01:40:37.212]  Okay?
[01:40:37.212 --> 01:40:39.453]  And that's all we wanted.
[01:40:39.453 --> 01:40:42.214]  But it was too much to ask, wasn't it?
[01:40:42.214 --> 01:40:44.295]  We're not allowed to put America first.
[01:40:44.295 --> 01:40:46.736]  We're not allowed to have free speech.
[01:40:46.736 --> 01:40:48.376]  We're not allowed to have a Second Amendment.
[01:40:48.376 --> 01:40:49.737]  We're not allowed to have a border.
[01:40:51.172 --> 01:40:54.213]  But you're allowed to do whatever you want!
[01:40:54.213 --> 01:40:55.934]  Politicize the FBI!
[01:40:55.934 --> 01:40:57.655]  Politicize the DOJ!
[01:40:57.655 --> 01:40:59.496]  Politicize the national media!
[01:40:59.496 --> 01:41:01.316]  Lie through your teeth all day long!
[01:41:01.316 --> 01:41:03.077]  Commit perjury and get away with it!
[01:41:03.077 --> 01:41:04.458]  That's all allowed!
[01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:06.919]  But we're not allowed to elect Donald Trump!
[01:41:06.919 --> 01:41:08.560]  That's what America's sick of!
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.921]  That's what the story is going to be at the end of this!
[01:41:10.921 --> 01:41:11.981]  You watch!
[01:41:11.981 --> 01:41:13.922]  They'll get their tremor!
[01:41:13.922 --> 01:41:15.223]  They'll get their media push!
[01:41:15.223 --> 01:41:16.883]  They'll get all their soundbites!
[01:41:16.883 --> 01:41:17.784]  Trump's a racist!
[01:41:18.584 --> 01:41:20.185]  Trump knew about WikiLeaks.
[01:41:20.185 --> 01:41:21.726]  What about Trump Moscow?
[01:41:21.726 --> 01:41:22.586]  That's fine.
[01:41:22.586 --> 01:41:23.767]  Go ahead.
[01:41:23.767 --> 01:41:26.108]  Win your 24 hours news cycle.
[01:41:26.108 --> 01:41:32.752]  Oh, but after that, after your tiny victory, you will be destroyed.
[01:41:32.752 --> 01:41:34.193]  That's why you're panicked.
[01:41:34.193 --> 01:41:36.694]  That's why you orchestrated this whole Michael Cohen thing.
[01:41:36.694 --> 01:41:38.815]  It's all one big desperate attempt.
[01:41:38.815 --> 01:41:42.878]  And they sit here and they say, we're going to get Trump's tax returns.
[01:41:42.878 --> 01:41:44.939]  They already have Trump's tax returns.
[01:41:44.939 --> 01:41:46.580]  If there's anything in it, they'd release it.
[01:41:48.078 --> 01:41:49.178]  Oh my gosh!
[01:41:49.178 --> 01:41:56.761]  Trump had a bogus bid on a portrait to make sure it sold and then he made it paid for by the Trump Foundation.
[01:41:56.761 --> 01:41:58.842]  Oh my God!
[01:41:58.842 --> 01:41:59.843]  Oh, oh!
[01:41:59.843 --> 01:42:03.864]  Let's call up the portrait for testimony now.
[01:42:03.864 --> 01:42:06.505]  I want that portrait on the stand.
[01:42:06.505 --> 01:42:09.066]  I have some questions for that portrait.
[01:42:09.066 --> 01:42:13.528]  Was that portrait colluding with Russia?
[01:42:13.528 --> 01:42:15.909]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:42:17.662 --> 01:42:33.388]  The American people are so sick of the corrupt establishment, so sick of politicized lies, so sick of politicized testimonies, so sick of politicized news, so sick of politicized bureaucracies, that's why Trump said I could shoot someone on 5th Street and still get elected!
[01:42:33.388 --> 01:42:41.571]  Because our hatred for your anti-American propaganda outweighs anything that you can try to do to make us mad!
[01:42:42.466 --> 01:42:43.987]  Do you understand that?
[01:42:43.987 --> 01:42:51.874]  Our despise of the liars in the media that go along with a Jesse Smollett hoax outweighs anything Trump has ever done.
[01:42:51.874 --> 01:42:55.658]  He could have paid off a hundred hookers and none of us would care because we're sick of you!
[01:43:06.604 --> 01:43:15.607]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:43:15.607 --> 01:43:25.689]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:43:25.689 --> 01:43:34.212]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:43:35.052 --> 01:43:36.394]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:43:36.394 --> 01:43:37.555]  You must experience it.
[01:43:37.555 --> 01:43:39.497]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:43:39.497 --> 01:43:44.562]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:43:44.562 --> 01:43:46.084]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:43:46.084 --> 01:43:47.565]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:43:47.565 --> 01:43:54.252]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:43:54.252 --> 01:43:55.753]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[01:43:57.196 --> 01:44:02.621]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[01:44:02.621 --> 01:44:04.402]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[01:44:04.402 --> 01:44:06.164]  Now I can be there for my children.
[01:44:06.164 --> 01:44:08.005]  Now I can make them strong.
[01:44:08.005 --> 01:44:09.647]  Now I can instruct them.
[01:44:09.647 --> 01:44:12.349]  Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[01:44:12.469 --> 01:44:17.592]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:44:17.592 --> 01:44:23.196]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:44:23.196 --> 01:44:26.839]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:44:26.839 --> 01:44:31.802]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[01:44:31.802 --> 01:44:38.707]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[01:44:38.707 --> 01:44:42.369]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[01:44:42.469 --> 01:44:50.115]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:44:50.115 --> 01:44:58.901]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[01:44:58.901 --> 01:45:11.170]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:45:12.290 --> 01:45:24.663]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[01:45:24.663 --> 01:45:26.585]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:45:26.585 --> 01:45:29.268]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:45:30.606 --> 01:45:34.948]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[01:45:34.948 --> 01:45:41.472]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:45:41.472 --> 01:45:43.794]  This country is in a war!
[01:45:43.794 --> 01:45:54.500]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:58.082]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[01:45:58.570 --> 01:46:02.692]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:46:02.692 --> 01:46:09.756]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[01:46:09.756 --> 01:46:14.579]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[01:46:14.579 --> 01:46:21.463]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system
[01:46:21.903 --> 01:46:27.908]  that will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[01:46:27.908 --> 01:46:37.495]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[01:46:37.495 --> 01:46:44.601]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[01:46:44.961 --> 01:47:01.317]  Head to infowarrestore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today!
[01:47:01.317 --> 01:47:03.959]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:20.771 --> 01:47:24.046]  It's getting more epic every second, folks.
[01:47:24.046 --> 01:47:25.713]  Every, every, yeah, time.
[01:47:27.413 --> 01:47:28.794]  Time is on our side, folks.
[01:47:28.794 --> 01:47:35.379]  Every grain of sand that falls through that funnel, the deep state gets closer towards total collapse.
[01:47:35.379 --> 01:47:37.460]  That's what this whole facade is about, folks.
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:38.120]  They're done!
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:39.421]  They've been totally exposed.
[01:47:39.421 --> 01:47:40.382]  It's just a matter of time.
[01:47:40.382 --> 01:47:42.964]  They're doing everything they can to try to patch it up.
[01:47:42.964 --> 01:47:43.904]  It's done.
[01:47:43.904 --> 01:47:45.625]  You're done.
[01:47:45.625 --> 01:47:46.566]  You people are done.
[01:47:46.566 --> 01:47:47.687]  You're fully exposed.
[01:47:47.687 --> 01:47:51.549]  And now, look, look, we're about to have James O'Keefe on.
[01:47:51.549 --> 01:47:55.252]  Project Veritas just released another bombshell video exposing the corruption at Facebook.
[01:47:55.984 --> 01:48:03.369]  But get this, WikiLeaks has just tweeted out statement on Michael Cohen testimony to Congress.
[01:48:03.369 --> 01:48:08.813]  WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange has never had a telephone call with Roger Stone.
[01:48:08.813 --> 01:48:11.055]  Boom.
[01:48:11.055 --> 01:48:15.318]  Did Michael Cohen just perjure himself under Democrat command?
[01:48:15.318 --> 01:48:22.163]  Did Michael Cohen cut a deal that he would get away with perjury today with the Democrats?
[01:48:22.163 --> 01:48:24.665]  Wow.
[01:48:24.665 --> 01:48:24.885]  Wow.
[01:48:27.421 --> 01:48:30.262]  The blowback has already begun.
[01:48:30.262 --> 01:48:33.544]  Oh, but here's the principle, see?
[01:48:33.544 --> 01:48:38.146]  Here's these emails proving that Hillary Clinton committed treason.
[01:48:38.146 --> 01:48:39.887]  How dare you give me those emails!
[01:48:39.887 --> 01:48:41.267]  You're going to jail!
[01:48:41.267 --> 01:48:42.688]  But the treason in the emails!
[01:48:42.688 --> 01:48:43.728]  Shut up!
[01:48:43.728 --> 01:48:46.209]  You're going to jail!
[01:48:46.209 --> 01:48:47.830]  And then what does CNN say?
[01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:49.651]  You're not allowed to read the WikiLeaks.
[01:48:53.307 --> 01:48:56.730]  Oh, you know why they don't want you to read the WikiLeaks, folks?
[01:48:56.730 --> 01:49:00.913]  Because these people go to frickin' spirit cookings, okay?
[01:49:00.913 --> 01:49:03.575]  They're going to damn spirit cookings!
[01:49:03.575 --> 01:49:07.098]  They're having hot dog parties for $66,000!
[01:49:07.098 --> 01:49:09.480]  We're not talking about hot dogs, folks!
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:12.362]  We're not talking about pizza!
[01:49:12.362 --> 01:49:13.863]  Woo!
[01:49:13.863 --> 01:49:19.688]  Now, let's go to the boil down before Project Veritas' James O'Keefe joins us.
[01:49:19.688 --> 01:49:22.770]  Their latest bombshell video exposing Facebook.
[01:49:28.186 --> 01:49:35.069]  This Facebook insider contacted us some time ago and provided us with what she says are internal Facebook documents.
[01:49:35.069 --> 01:49:39.231]  I saw things going on that I personally found to be troubling.
[01:49:39.231 --> 01:49:45.435]  I knew that something had to be done about it, and so I felt that the best thing to do was to inform the public.
[01:49:45.435 --> 01:49:48.036]  This is Danny Ben David, a software engineer.
[01:49:48.496 --> 01:49:55.619]  In the leaked documents our insider gave us, we came across a back-end view of Mike Cernovich's page.
[01:49:55.619 --> 01:50:02.021]  On it, we could see Ben David running an action called, Action Deboost Live Distribution.
[01:50:02.021 --> 01:50:08.563]  In fact, Ben David wrote the code and may have invented the word, deboost.
[01:50:08.563 --> 01:50:12.124]  Deboosting is a method of suppressing distribution.
[01:50:12.124 --> 01:50:16.326]  This occurs because props such as, share this video, are disabled.
[01:50:17.006 --> 01:50:19.767]  Interactive notifications are also disabled.
[01:50:19.767 --> 01:50:22.809]  And the live feed boost is removed.
[01:50:22.809 --> 01:50:24.649]  Where did you see this appear?
[01:50:24.649 --> 01:50:26.650]  On whose pages?
[01:50:26.650 --> 01:50:29.932]  I would see it appear on several different conservative pages.
[01:50:31.543 --> 01:50:44.714]  I first noticed it with an account that I can't remember, but I remember once I started looking at it, I also saw it on Mike Cernovich's page, saw it on Steven Crowder's page, as well as the Daily Caller's page.
[01:50:44.714 --> 01:50:49.118]  We spoke to Steven Crowder about this and he was disappointed but not surprised.
[01:50:49.118 --> 01:50:52.521]  He told us that this is not the first time Facebook has targeted him.
[01:50:52.521 --> 01:50:56.545]  I came across a document called, um, Coordinated Trolling.
[01:50:57.325 --> 01:50:58.687]  On Facebook.
[01:50:58.687 --> 01:51:01.049]  And it was this troll report.
[01:51:01.049 --> 01:51:06.254]  Where they wanted to address the problem of trolls on the platform.
[01:51:06.254 --> 01:51:09.377]  And what they could do to combat it.
[01:51:09.377 --> 01:51:14.302]  Seiji Yamamoto and Eduardo Areno de la Rubia are the authors of that troll report.
[01:51:14.873 --> 01:51:24.517]  It was clearly kind of designed at the aim to be the right-wing meme culture that's become extremely prevalent in the past few years.
[01:51:24.517 --> 01:51:31.960]  In Yamamoto's troll presentation deck, he writes that they have a classifier that predicts if the user is a troll.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:35.042]  The term troll refers to an internet troublemaker.
[01:51:35.862 --> 01:51:40.325]  Listing flagged words such as cuck, wee, normie.
[01:51:40.325 --> 01:51:47.370]  It's clear that Facebook is targeting the language of... Oh my God!
[01:51:47.370 --> 01:51:49.691]  These people at Facebook, man.
[01:51:49.691 --> 01:51:50.592]  That's such a joke.
[01:51:50.592 --> 01:51:56.696]  I mean, look.
[01:51:56.696 --> 01:51:57.336]  I'm sorry.
[01:51:57.336 --> 01:51:59.378]  This is too ridiculous today.
[01:51:59.378 --> 01:52:00.979]  It's just too ridiculous.
[01:52:02.097 --> 01:52:06.478]  Oh, and we haven't even begun to get into the ridiculous state on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:52:06.478 --> 01:52:10.359]  Just wait until Alex joins us and James O'Keefe joins us here shortly.
[01:52:10.359 --> 01:52:17.660]  But folks, look.
[01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:21.941]  I don't even know what to say.
[01:52:21.941 --> 01:52:24.041]  Facebook doesn't suppress me.
[01:52:24.041 --> 01:52:26.722]  Facebook doesn't de-boost me.
[01:52:26.722 --> 01:52:28.142]  I'm not even allowed on!
[01:52:30.501 --> 01:52:33.523]  InfoWars isn't even allowed on Facebook!
[01:52:33.523 --> 01:52:36.865]  So look, I stand with Steven Crowder and Mike Cernovich.
[01:52:36.865 --> 01:52:38.265]  I don't know Steve.
[01:52:38.265 --> 01:52:40.387]  I talked to Mike.
[01:52:40.387 --> 01:52:51.593]  So, yeah, obviously Facebook is de-boosting you guys, but we're not even allowed on it!
[01:52:51.593 --> 01:52:52.453]  I don't know what we do.
[01:52:52.453 --> 01:52:57.516]  I mean, but so, there is a new FTC task force.
[01:52:57.516 --> 01:52:58.457]  This was in The Verge today.
[01:53:00.442 --> 01:53:11.666]  Will this task force that's going to be investigating the monopolistic powers of the tech industry be looking at the censorship issue?
[01:53:11.666 --> 01:53:15.427]  New FTC task force will take on tech monopolies.
[01:53:15.427 --> 01:53:19.908]  The Federal Trade Commission will be launching a task force to monitor competition in the U.S.
[01:53:19.908 --> 01:53:22.169]  technology markets, commissioners announced today.
[01:53:22.169 --> 01:53:22.569]  Oh!
[01:53:22.569 --> 01:53:24.550]  You mean like how they de-platformed Gab?
[01:53:25.646 --> 01:53:27.626]  When it was competing with Twitter?
[01:53:27.626 --> 01:53:34.007]  Oh, you mean like how they cut conservatives' bank accounts?
[01:53:34.007 --> 01:53:36.588]  Will you be investigating that?
[01:53:36.588 --> 01:53:42.169]  A team of attorneys will be heading the new FTC task force.
[01:53:42.169 --> 01:53:46.570]  Somehow, I feel like nothing's gonna happen, though.
[01:53:46.570 --> 01:53:47.790]  Which is fine.
[01:53:47.790 --> 01:53:53.771]  You know, and look, so they banned me on social media.
[01:53:53.771 --> 01:53:54.051]  Fine.
[01:53:55.305 --> 01:54:03.893]  You know, really the funny thing is, if we weren't so dedicated here at InfoWars, it would actually make our job easier.
[01:54:03.893 --> 01:54:11.361]  Because we'll just, I could just throw my hands in the air and just say, fine, I'm not doing any more live streams on Facebook or anything.
[01:54:11.361 --> 01:54:12.422]  Fine!
[01:54:12.422 --> 01:54:16.426]  You know, fine, fine, we'll just do our ten hours of live broadcasts.
[01:54:17.341 --> 01:54:19.683]  At Infowars.com slash show and fine!
[01:54:19.683 --> 01:54:22.206]  Don't let us on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.
[01:54:22.206 --> 01:54:25.189]  Don't let us break in when there's live breaking news happening.
[01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:27.431]  Don't let us break in when there's viral things happening.
[01:54:27.431 --> 01:54:28.792]  Just, you know, that's fine!
[01:54:28.792 --> 01:54:29.253]  Fine then!
[01:54:29.253 --> 01:54:32.036]  We won't work as hard!
[01:54:32.036 --> 01:54:35.059]  But that's just not our tendency.
[01:54:35.059 --> 01:54:37.061]  And so we play whack-a-mole with these people.
[01:54:37.061 --> 01:54:38.182]  We play games with these people.
[01:54:39.164 --> 01:54:41.206]  And I wasn't even trying to play a whack-a-mole or game.
[01:54:41.206 --> 01:54:47.052]  I just wanted to have a presence on Facebook because there's a lot of family and friends that follow me, formerly, on the War Room there.
[01:54:47.052 --> 01:54:50.416]  And it's not, I don't even go, I'm not even in InfoWars studio.
[01:54:50.416 --> 01:54:54.880]  I just walk outside to the Texas State Capitol for one video on Facebook.
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:56.622]  It's titled, Is Free Speech Dead in America?
[01:54:56.622 --> 01:54:58.203]  They banned me.
[01:54:58.203 --> 01:55:01.607]  I'm on Facebook for less than 24 hours before they banned me.
[01:55:01.607 --> 01:55:02.408]  I think I have the record.
[01:55:04.898 --> 01:55:05.879]  I think I have the record.
[01:55:05.879 --> 01:55:10.122]  I was allowed on Facebook for 14 hours before they banned me.
[01:55:10.122 --> 01:55:14.386]  So hey, I stand with Steven Crowder and Mike Cernovich.
[01:55:14.386 --> 01:55:16.387]  I think they're great people.
[01:55:16.387 --> 01:55:19.009]  But at least you guys are allowed to exist.
[01:55:19.009 --> 01:55:21.832]  I'm not even allowed on!
[01:55:21.832 --> 01:55:24.234]  I don't even get to be de-boosted.
[01:55:24.234 --> 01:55:26.415]  I don't have the honor of de-boosting.
[01:55:26.415 --> 01:55:29.618]  I don't even exist.
[01:55:29.618 --> 01:55:30.339]  But fine.
[01:55:31.633 --> 01:55:45.319]  Thank you so much, you losers at Facebook, you losers listening to this broadcast right now, that you spend your late nights debating whether Owen Schroyer gets to be on Facebook.
[01:55:45.319 --> 01:55:49.200]  You guys are such losers.
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:53.522]  And then all you did was make my broadcast more powerful!
[01:55:53.522 --> 01:55:57.063]  The title of my broadcast was, Is Free Speech Dead in America?
[01:55:57.063 --> 01:55:58.024]  And then you banned me!
[01:56:00.267 --> 01:56:01.167]  And you know what's funny?
[01:56:01.167 --> 01:56:08.949]  Because... See, I'm telling you, like, where is my head of neon green hair?
[01:56:08.949 --> 01:56:14.910]  You don't think I titled it that because I knew you were gonna ban me?
[01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:21.211]  And that all my friends and family that hadn't heard or seen from me in years would see that and be like, what is he talking about?
[01:56:21.211 --> 01:56:24.172]  And then they go to my Facebook page the next day and I'm gone?
[01:56:24.172 --> 01:56:27.973]  I just trolled you into the- into oblivion!
[01:56:29.451 --> 01:56:33.595]  We're so ahead of these people, they can't, they don't even know what's going on!
[01:56:33.595 --> 01:56:38.439]  We're literally running laps around them, and they don't even, they're like, what?
[01:56:38.439 --> 01:56:40.261]  What the hell, we didn't even know you had legs!
[01:56:40.261 --> 01:56:45.485]  I don't even know if I should get into this now.
[01:56:45.485 --> 01:56:48.608]  But folks, I mean, we are trolling these people on a next level.
[01:56:48.608 --> 01:56:50.750]  They don't even understand it!
[01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:54.033]  They literally don't even get it!
[01:56:54.033 --> 01:56:55.454]  It's like another language to them!
[01:56:58.117 --> 01:57:02.459]  And that's why they have a quote-unquote troll report at Facebook.
[01:57:02.459 --> 01:57:05.120]  Because they don't even get what the hell's going on!
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:12.603]  That's why they try to bam, ban a Pepe the Frog meme.
[01:57:12.603 --> 01:57:14.724]  They don't even get it!
[01:57:14.724 --> 01:57:17.405]  And then they look for words like Chatelet.
[01:57:17.405 --> 01:57:23.568]  That is so Kekistan level deep, I can't even believe they know what it is.
[01:57:23.568 --> 01:57:26.549]  But it shows you how obsessed with us they are.
[01:57:26.869 --> 01:57:28.431]  And they don't even get it!
[01:57:28.431 --> 01:57:30.433]  They don't even speak our language!
[01:57:30.433 --> 01:57:32.815]  And yet they listen to us all day long!
[01:57:32.815 --> 01:57:33.716]  Imagine!
[01:57:33.716 --> 01:57:41.645]  Tuning into a foreign language broadcast that is in a foreign language that you don't understand, but you listen to it every hour trying to get it!
[01:57:41.645 --> 01:57:43.947]  That's who these people are!
[01:57:43.947 --> 01:57:45.769]  James O'Keefe joins us shortly.
[01:57:45.769 --> 01:57:46.410]  This is unbelievable.
[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:49.841]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[01:58:50.249 --> 01:58:54.972]  Hard-working Americans need high-quality energy when they're on the run.
[01:58:54.972 --> 01:59:05.418]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with the highest quality protein bar in vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter at Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:05.418 --> 01:59:09.561]  This is a high-end bar sold for up to six, seven dollars at Whole Foods.
[01:59:09.561 --> 01:59:12.443]  Normally we sell it for three dollars a piece when you get it in the box.
[01:59:13.123 --> 01:59:20.388]  But with the discount we're running right now as an introductory offer, it's $2.40 a bar, no one can top that, and it funds Liberty and the fight against the Globalists.
[01:59:20.388 --> 01:59:23.650]  With 15 grams of protein and so much more, they're amazing.

[01:59:33.276 --> 01:59:34.116]  It's up to you.
[01:59:34.116 --> 01:59:34.477]  It's easy.
[01:59:34.957 --> 01:59:36.558]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:07.342 --> 02:00:17.205]  You can't see it, but I actually have a big, big head of neon green hair that sticks about two feet in the air.
[02:00:17.205 --> 02:00:23.047]  You just can't see it unless you take the DMT.
[02:00:23.047 --> 02:00:24.688]  We're waiting for James O'Keefe to be joining us.
[02:00:24.688 --> 02:00:28.189]  He's obviously very busy right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:28.189 --> 02:00:35.452]  Alex Jones is currently on a secret mission, and he will be breaking into the broadcast any time now as well.
[02:00:36.277 --> 02:00:44.201]  And you will see just what Alex has been up to in the last 12 hours and beyond.
[02:00:44.201 --> 02:00:53.385]  You know, I'm kind of just like a spaceship just blasting through space right now, so I'm kind of just out of control.
[02:00:53.385 --> 02:00:57.487]  In fact, the crew is giving me an update right now.
[02:00:57.487 --> 02:01:00.368]  Okay, so James O'Keefe will be joining us.
[02:01:01.875 --> 02:01:04.477]  On the other side of this break.
[02:01:04.477 --> 02:01:07.279]  I still gotta play these powerful Robert Barnes segments.
[02:01:07.279 --> 02:01:10.341]  We're still gonna hear from Alex Jones, who's on a secret mission.
[02:01:10.341 --> 02:01:13.803]  I've got all kinds of news, honestly, that I need to get to.
[02:01:13.803 --> 02:01:16.304]  The crew just handed me a stack of news.
[02:01:16.304 --> 02:01:18.106]  We got more clips from the Cohen testimony.
[02:01:18.106 --> 02:01:23.609]  I mean, we are just... We've got all of this ammunition and not enough guns to fire it out of.
[02:01:23.609 --> 02:01:23.649]  So...
[02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:35.652]  Let me just do a little news coverage here before we're joined by James O'Keefe, just outside the lines of what we've been talking about.
[02:01:35.652 --> 02:01:39.313]  Trump finishes meeting with Kim Jong-un after very good dialogue.
[02:01:39.313 --> 02:01:44.975]  Now here's something that the mainstream media either understands and lies about or doesn't understand.
[02:01:44.975 --> 02:01:52.357]  President Trump and Kim Jong-un would not be meeting in Vietnam if they hadn't already made a deal.
[02:01:53.956 --> 02:02:17.790]  Now I don't know what that means as far as denuclearization or if there's going to be some sort of compact or agreement that gets signed, but they're not going to fly all the way out there and take their team and the security and everything unless they've already reached some sort of perspective agreement and or what they've agreed on what the goals what the the mission is together.
[02:02:17.790 --> 02:02:20.332]  But we're not talking about President Trump.
[02:02:22.921 --> 02:02:26.904]  Making headway on a peace deal for the Koreas?
[02:02:26.904 --> 02:02:32.728]  No, we're talking about Michael Cohen, an anti-American traitor.
[02:02:32.728 --> 02:02:33.789]  Aren't we?
[02:02:33.789 --> 02:02:45.778]  We're not talking about Ed Buck now being sued by the family of one of the men that died in his home, one of the multiple men.
[02:02:45.778 --> 02:02:47.280]  You know, he's had a couple men die in his house.
[02:02:50.009 --> 02:03:04.914]  You know, I don't want to get into the racial aspect of it, but let's just say, if it was a Republican, and you had these colored, the color skin that these people have, die in the Republican's house, it'd be national news.
[02:03:04.914 --> 02:03:06.534]  But it's a Democrat, so it doesn't matter.
[02:03:06.534 --> 02:03:11.376]  And of course, the point is, it shouldn't matter whether they're black or white or brown or male or female.
[02:03:14.167 --> 02:03:16.469]  It shouldn't matter, and it doesn't!
[02:03:16.469 --> 02:03:27.698]  What matters is that a Democrat donor has had multiple men die in his what has been called, I believe, a sex dungeon!
[02:03:27.698 --> 02:03:35.564]  So, you know, that just happens and it doesn't get any media coverage, does it?
[02:03:35.564 --> 02:03:38.426]  Funny how that works.
[02:03:38.426 --> 02:03:40.708]  But who knows what this lawsuit might bring.
[02:03:40.708 --> 02:03:42.590]  Of course, good friends with Adam Schiff
[02:03:44.568 --> 02:03:50.414]  I believe it was Adam Schiff who said, if Mueller doesn't find Russian collusion, I'll find it!
[02:03:50.414 --> 02:03:54.057]  Of course, Adam Schiff has said he has the proof.
[02:03:54.057 --> 02:03:56.019]  No, no, you don't.
[02:03:56.019 --> 02:04:00.624]  You know, I wasn't going to cover this, but this was breaking all throughout the night, and now it looks like it's getting worse.
[02:04:02.023 --> 02:04:09.831]  India bombs Pakistan, Pakistan vows retaliation, and so there were bombs going both ways.
[02:04:09.831 --> 02:04:14.897]  Jake Lloyd has reported InfoWars.com, so tensions over there.
[02:04:14.897 --> 02:04:19.962]  That's, you know, hate to see that, but it's kind of been building over there for a while.
[02:04:21.034 --> 02:04:26.561]  UPS suspends deliveries in Swedish no-go zone, citing attacks on drivers.
[02:04:26.561 --> 02:04:28.604]  Do I really need to tell you the story there, folks?
[02:04:28.604 --> 02:04:31.567]  I think you know what it is.
[02:04:31.567 --> 02:04:36.093]  In Sweden also, they had a new city welcome sign that featured a woman in a hijab.
[02:04:36.093 --> 02:04:38.736]  Well, the Swedish people weren't so pleased with that.
[02:04:38.736 --> 02:04:39.137]  That's not...
[02:04:39.637 --> 02:04:43.424]  Their culture, so they literally shot the billboard up.
[02:04:43.424 --> 02:04:47.591]  But I guess that's Islamophobia if you don't let Islam take over your nation.
[02:04:47.591 --> 02:04:51.859]  I guess it's Islamophobia if you wanna have your own culture that's not Islam.
[02:04:51.859 --> 02:04:52.761]  That's Islamophobia now.
[02:05:05.538 --> 02:05:14.563]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:05:14.563 --> 02:05:24.629]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:33.174]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:05:33.994 --> 02:05:35.335]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:05:35.335 --> 02:05:36.496]  You must experience it.
[02:05:36.496 --> 02:05:38.438]  It is a total game changer.
[02:05:38.438 --> 02:05:43.502]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix in fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:05:43.502 --> 02:05:45.023]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[02:05:45.023 --> 02:05:46.504]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:05:46.504 --> 02:05:53.189]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:54.691]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:08.106]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:06:08.106 --> 02:06:10.387]  It's Owen Troyer.
[02:06:10.387 --> 02:06:14.131]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:14.131 --> 02:06:24.959]  You know, I was working in sports media before I got into politics, and I rubbed elbows with Hall of Famers, greatest athletes to ever walk the face of the earth, and
[02:06:26.476 --> 02:06:28.600]  Never really was that big of a deal to me.
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:33.670]  My next guest should have a closet full of Pulitzer Prizes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:35.196 --> 02:06:40.118]  I mean, I am in awe of my next guest, James O'Keefe from Project Veritas.
[02:06:40.118 --> 02:06:46.339]  They've just released their latest bombshell video exposing Facebook, de-boosting, having a troll patrol.
[02:06:46.339 --> 02:06:47.980]  It's really just crazy stuff.
[02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:52.762]  In a fair world, James O'Keefe, you should have a closet full of Pulitzer Prizes, but I know you don't do this for glory.
[02:06:52.762 --> 02:06:54.262]  I know you don't do this for medals.
[02:06:54.262 --> 02:06:57.423]  You do this because you love truth and you love America.
[02:06:57.423 --> 02:07:01.044]  So, what is the latest video from Project Veritas?
[02:07:01.044 --> 02:07:03.665]  What did you guys expose is going on over there at Facebook?
[02:07:04.229 --> 02:07:11.739]  Well, an insider inside Facebook came to us with a series of documents from within Facebook.
[02:07:11.739 --> 02:07:19.069]  This is a woman who was terminated from the company a year ago for taking these documents, taking pictures.
[02:07:19.955 --> 02:07:23.517]  Came to us and said that they are de-boosting people.
[02:07:23.517 --> 02:07:24.358]  What does that mean?
[02:07:24.358 --> 02:07:37.286]  Well, the documents show code that was written by a Facebook engineer that assigned a de-boost score, which means they are downranking live stream videos.
[02:07:37.286 --> 02:07:43.790]  They are making it so that it doesn't show up on your timeline if it contains certain keywords.
[02:07:43.790 --> 02:07:45.491]  And this is without you knowing.
[02:07:46.033 --> 02:07:50.855]  So it's very similar to what happened with Twitter last year with the shadow banning stuff that we exposed.
[02:07:50.855 --> 02:08:01.980]  So the engineers are de-boosting certain videos that show up on the Daily Caller, Steven Crowder, Mike Cernovich, and other websites, but only on the conservative websites.
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:05.602]  This insider looked at liberal websites did not show up.
[02:08:05.602 --> 02:08:09.163]  She also released documents of a so-called troll report.
[02:08:09.163 --> 02:08:10.864]  We have all these documents on our website.
[02:08:11.531 --> 02:08:16.773]  And it shows keywords that they're using to identify a troll score.
[02:08:16.773 --> 02:08:25.137]  This is using machine learning and all these sort of computer programs that assign troll scores to people on Facebook if you use certain words.
[02:08:25.137 --> 02:08:28.058]  These are not white supremacist words or racist words.
[02:08:28.058 --> 02:08:36.722]  These are words like normie and lulz and MSM and these sort of words that have been appropriated by conservatives and meme culture.
[02:08:36.722 --> 02:08:39.823]  So Facebook has never said that they've done this publicly.
[02:08:40.726 --> 02:08:44.728]  And there is a policy to put you back up if you're banned on Facebook.
[02:08:44.728 --> 02:08:47.269]  There are human beings that you can appeal.
[02:08:47.269 --> 02:08:48.190]  This is not that.
[02:08:48.190 --> 02:08:56.914]  This is a secret program in these documents that this person who blew the whistle gave to us and lost her job as a result.
[02:08:56.914 --> 02:08:58.535]  So pretty significant stuff.
[02:08:58.535 --> 02:09:04.138]  And as you can see right there on the screen, one of the data scientists, this engineer Yamamoto is his name.
[02:09:04.138 --> 02:09:06.699]  He works at Facebook and he says that we have to
[02:09:07.439 --> 02:09:10.282]  Uh, uh, operate near the perimeter of hate speech.
[02:09:10.282 --> 02:09:12.965]  We need to address the perimeter of hate speech.
[02:09:12.965 --> 02:09:20.873]  We don't know exactly what that means, but these documents shed light on, on how they're banning speech that is not racist.
[02:09:20.873 --> 02:09:22.255]  It's not extreme.
[02:09:22.255 --> 02:09:24.137]  It's just normal political language.
[02:09:25.029 --> 02:09:35.096]  Now, have you ever done a cross-reference to all of the undercover videos that you guys have from these big tech companies, from these social media giants?
[02:09:35.096 --> 02:09:47.905]  It's like, maybe I'm running an end-around, giving you a video idea here, but it's like, I mean, it's like you could play the Facebook testimony, the YouTube testimony, the Twitter testimony, saying they're not shadowbanning, they're not engaged in political censorship at all, and then
[02:09:48.525 --> 02:09:53.529]  You didn't play the videos of you having them on tape admitting they're doing that.
[02:09:53.529 --> 02:09:56.091]  So it's like, I mean, you're here breaking this.
[02:09:56.091 --> 02:10:01.976]  I mean, you've caught these people, these are some of the most powerful companies in the West, engaged in blatant perjury.
[02:10:01.976 --> 02:10:07.721]  I mean, how is it that you kept these people engaged in blatant perjury and it just seems that the media wants to ignore it?
[02:10:09.525 --> 02:10:18.423]  Well, in a Twitter story, and we released a 20 minute video, I encourage everyone to watch it, 20 minutes long video, but you should listen to the testimony of the person who blew the whistle.
[02:10:19.367 --> 02:10:27.989]  The Twitter story, the guy on hidden camera actually said, this is last year, he says, one strategy is to shadow ban.
[02:10:27.989 --> 02:10:31.029]  That's, the person does not know they're being banned.
[02:10:31.029 --> 02:10:37.830]  In Congress, Twitter's lobbyist was asked about that video, and he says, we do not shadow ban.
[02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:41.451]  So, we always like to compare what they say in private versus public.
[02:10:41.451 --> 02:10:48.332]  What's interesting about this video is Mark Zuckerberg testified in Congress last year, he says that we don't intend to ban political speech.
[02:10:49.016 --> 02:10:57.120]  But what the documents show is that they take, they take these words that are, that are not, they're not extreme.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:57.920]  They're not racist.
[02:10:57.920 --> 02:11:01.101]  They're just like mainstream media is listed in the document.
[02:11:01.101 --> 02:11:01.962]  The word MSM.
[02:11:01.962 --> 02:11:07.664]  Now that is a right, that is conservatives would, I mean, 90% of the people who use that word are conservative.
[02:11:07.664 --> 02:11:16.748]  Liberals don't say MSM very often, but they take that word and they put it into some type of system that determines, that gives you a score, a troll score.
[02:11:17.512 --> 02:11:21.375]  And then they de-boost you for using certain words as well.
[02:11:21.375 --> 02:11:23.277]  That's what these documents show.
[02:11:23.277 --> 02:11:24.918]  So, of course, why doesn't the mainstream media cover it?
[02:11:24.918 --> 02:11:29.703]  Well, they do cover if there's a groundswell, if there's enough pressure.
[02:11:29.703 --> 02:11:31.624]  And it's a very powerful company.
[02:11:31.624 --> 02:11:40.252]  A lot of media organizations don't want to report about Facebook because they get their profit and their advertising revenue from Facebook.
[02:11:40.252 --> 02:11:44.976]  So they don't want to upset the apple cart, which makes this story even more difficult to report.
[02:11:45.436 --> 02:11:54.205]  And of course it was, I believe, E-Marketeer or MarketWatch that just published the report last week that now digital advertising has surpassed all other forms of advertising.
[02:11:54.205 --> 02:11:58.309]  So we're talking about the main platform for marketing and advertising now.
[02:11:58.309 --> 02:12:06.398]  And with the FTC just announcing this new committee that they have essentially that's going to be looking into monopolistic practices of these big tech companies, you wonder
[02:12:06.818 --> 02:12:08.559]  I mean, are they going to be contacting you?
[02:12:08.559 --> 02:12:16.622]  I mean, James, you've got more undercover dirt on these people than anyone else out there, I guess, other than people that are actually working there that haven't contacted you.
[02:12:16.622 --> 02:12:25.746]  Do you have any insight into what the FTC, this new group that they're going to be launching into the big tech companies and the monopolistic practices there?
[02:12:25.746 --> 02:12:27.847]  Do you have any insight into what their goals might be?
[02:12:27.847 --> 02:12:28.927]  Have they reached out to you at all?
[02:12:32.284 --> 02:12:34.865]  They have not reached out to me yet.
[02:12:34.865 --> 02:12:44.289]  The congressional testimony of the Twitter lobbyists last year, they actually quoted the videos, so I expect that Congress will continue to quote the videos.
[02:12:44.289 --> 02:12:55.873]  I think the most important thing that can happen right now, aside from regulation, I don't have the power to regulate corporations, but I think the power to expose them is the most powerful thing.
[02:12:57.145 --> 02:13:00.066]  I think that gives ammunition to people who want to give reform.
[02:13:00.066 --> 02:13:01.426]  Right now they have no ammunition.
[02:13:01.426 --> 02:13:14.871]  So the people watching your show, which there are many, many, many committed, heroic, brave individuals watching this program as I speak, what I would encourage, I bet you there's someone watching the show on the inside of Google or Facebook.
[02:13:14.871 --> 02:13:15.511]  I guarantee it.
[02:13:15.511 --> 02:13:16.431]  They work there.
[02:13:16.431 --> 02:13:17.451]  I guarantee it.
[02:13:17.451 --> 02:13:22.533]  So what I would actually suggest is the call to action is this person who leaked these documents,
[02:13:23.554 --> 02:13:26.677]  We actually gave her a job because she was fired.
[02:13:26.677 --> 02:13:29.539]  She was fired from Facebook and then she went on food stamps for a few months.
[02:13:29.539 --> 02:13:30.860]  I mean, it was awful.
[02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:33.742]  So we hired her to be a reporter for us.
[02:13:33.742 --> 02:13:42.489]  And I think what needs to happen is the people watching this program, go to our website, projectveritas.com slash brave.
[02:13:42.489 --> 02:13:45.811]  And if you are on the inside of one of these companies, reach out to us.
[02:13:45.811 --> 02:13:49.114]  Doesn't mean you have to take photographs yet.
[02:13:49.114 --> 02:13:50.695]  It just means reach out to us.
[02:13:51.355 --> 02:13:55.417]  Because we want to go out there and film the abuses.
[02:13:55.417 --> 02:13:58.918]  We want you to be brave and do something about the problems in our society.
[02:13:58.918 --> 02:14:05.381]  I don't have the power to regulate the companies, but I do have the power to expose them, and that is the biggest power of all.
[02:14:05.381 --> 02:14:08.062]  Because it gives ammunition to the people who want to implement reform.
[02:14:08.062 --> 02:14:10.443]  I don't know what the solution is, whether it's to break the companies up,
[02:14:11.324 --> 02:14:14.947]  I can tell you that I've had conversations with journalists over the last 24 hours.
[02:14:14.947 --> 02:14:16.968]  I don't want to touch Facebook.
[02:14:16.968 --> 02:14:20.971]  I get my money from Facebook vis-a-vis advertising.
[02:14:20.971 --> 02:14:22.031]  I don't have that problem.
[02:14:22.031 --> 02:14:23.372]  I'm a non-profit organization.
[02:14:23.372 --> 02:14:26.635]  I don't have advertisers and it allows me a degree of independence.
[02:14:26.635 --> 02:14:37.362]  So I would say my request is to have people on this show go to projectbaratos.com slash brave and send us an encrypted note if you are on the inside of these companies.
[02:14:38.635 --> 02:14:43.597]  James, one of the questions I get asked more than anything else is, how can I get involved?
[02:14:43.597 --> 02:14:44.698]  How can I take action?
[02:14:44.698 --> 02:14:45.658]  What can I do?
[02:14:45.658 --> 02:14:46.839]  Well, there's different levels.
[02:14:46.839 --> 02:14:59.704]  You can share the links that are banned to InfoWars, you can share the links on Facebook that they de-boost, the links on Twitter that they shadow ban, you can get involved, you can go out on the street, engage in activity, street protests, street art, all kinds of different stuff.
[02:15:01.716 --> 02:15:02.976]  This is next level, James.
[02:15:02.976 --> 02:15:09.198]  Give your call to action one more time and how brave patriots can join the fight with Project Veritas.
[02:15:09.198 --> 02:15:09.658]  Thank you.
[02:15:09.658 --> 02:15:11.638]  Thank you for teeing that up.
[02:15:11.638 --> 02:15:17.159]  Listen, not everyone is meant to strap a camera to their chest and like go inside Google and film.
[02:15:17.159 --> 02:15:20.420]  I mean, that's a very special activity.
[02:15:20.420 --> 02:15:21.320]  But let me tell you something.
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:24.061]  Of all the people watching this program, I bet you there's at least one.
[02:15:24.955 --> 02:15:25.936]  Maybe two.
[02:15:25.936 --> 02:15:27.256]  Hey, maybe there's six.
[02:15:27.256 --> 02:15:32.700]  I don't know how many thousands of people are watching this right now, but there has to be at least one person.
[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:40.545]  I'm not... I mean, yes, you can donate, you can share the post, do all that by all means, and it doesn't mean you're not brave if you're not willing to wear the camera.
[02:15:40.545 --> 02:15:43.026]  But I'm looking for the people who are.
[02:15:43.026 --> 02:15:52.052]  I'm looking for the people who are willing to do something, because people throughout history, whether it be Ed Snowden, or James Damore, or David Blythe... It's ProjectVeritas.com, folks.
[02:15:52.052 --> 02:15:52.772]  It's James O'Keefe.
[02:15:52.772 --> 02:15:53.493]  Work with the legend.

[02:16:05.565 --> 02:16:14.407]  After building a seven-figure business from his couch, God called him to ministry to teach prosperity based on pain he could not tolerate in others' lives.
[02:16:14.847 --> 02:16:17.470]  IRS, creditors, car loans, debt.

[02:16:55.256 --> 02:16:56.496]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.496 --> 02:17:00.417]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.417 --> 02:17:01.958]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.958 --> 02:17:04.919]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.919 --> 02:17:10.460]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.460 --> 02:17:11.680]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:14.601]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:14.601 --> 02:17:16.822]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:17:24.864 --> 02:17:31.208]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:31.208 --> 02:17:34.250]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:34.250 --> 02:17:40.173]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:40.173 --> 02:17:43.956]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.956 --> 02:17:45.236]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:45.236 --> 02:17:46.577]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.577 --> 02:17:52.781]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:52.781 --> 02:17:54.202]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:02.450]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:18:02.450 --> 02:18:05.375]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootworkstore.com.
[02:18:05.375 --> 02:18:09.421]  With MFootwork Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply.

[02:19:59.662 --> 02:20:02.325]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:22.407 --> 02:20:26.869]  So, we just had James O'Keefe on from Project Veritas.
[02:20:26.869 --> 02:20:39.534]  I urge you, if you have the will and the capacity to join Project Veritas and go undercover and get footage for them, that's not for some people.
[02:20:39.534 --> 02:20:41.875]  I ask you to join the InfoWars Army.
[02:20:41.875 --> 02:20:43.796]  Go out and engage in street activism.
[02:20:43.796 --> 02:20:45.576]  Go out to your city council.
[02:20:45.576 --> 02:20:49.378]  Go out and put a sign up above a major highway.
[02:20:49.378 --> 02:20:51.859]  Go out and post a bunch of stickers around your city.
[02:20:53.490 --> 02:20:55.091]  I always have people tweeting me how they do that.
[02:20:55.091 --> 02:20:58.172]  I always retweet them.
[02:20:58.172 --> 02:21:04.895]  Yeah, if they want to censor us in the digital world, yeah, we take action in the real world.
[02:21:04.895 --> 02:21:06.815]  Infowarsarmy.com.
[02:21:06.815 --> 02:21:07.896]  I don't even plug these things.
[02:21:07.896 --> 02:21:12.178]  Infocomms.org is where InfoWarriors can link up and communicate.
[02:21:12.178 --> 02:21:13.798]  It's a great platform.
[02:21:13.798 --> 02:21:16.499]  Again, they ban us on social media, so we just create our own social media.
[02:21:16.499 --> 02:21:20.121]  Infocomms.org.
[02:21:20.121 --> 02:21:22.442]  So, I gotta say though,
[02:21:24.628 --> 02:21:28.169]  James O'Keefe was just on with us, folks.
[02:21:28.169 --> 02:21:38.630]  The guy is literally, I understand it so much, but he's sitting at his desk and he's got his lunch sitting at his desk.
[02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:50.172]  He's preempting eating lunch to come on with us at InfoWars and to give you the breaking news that they just released at ProjectVeritas.com.
[02:21:50.172 --> 02:21:53.153]  And it sounds mundane and trivial,
[02:21:54.451 --> 02:22:02.174]  But I respect that so much, because believe it or not, that's really rare.
[02:22:02.174 --> 02:22:03.454]  It is really rare.
[02:22:03.454 --> 02:22:05.755]  Especially in media.
[02:22:05.755 --> 02:22:07.996]  I mean, it's a thing.
[02:22:07.996 --> 02:22:16.659]  People know, like, you go into media, a lot of people tend to gain weight, get a little bit unhealthy, and get a little lazy, even.
[02:22:16.659 --> 02:22:19.360]  It's like a weird thing.
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:20.941]  But, not James O'Keefe.
[02:22:26.266 --> 02:22:29.208]  So, it was great to be joined by him again.
[02:22:29.208 --> 02:22:38.732]  The latest video at Project Veritas exposes Facebook and the censorship that they are engaged in.
[02:22:38.732 --> 02:22:45.095]  Now, Roger Stone was a big topic of discussion during the testimony of Michael Cohen.
[02:22:45.095 --> 02:22:46.616]  By the way, is that still live right now, guys?
[02:22:49.341 --> 02:22:53.665]  So we're going on, I think, hour four now of the Cohen testimony.
[02:22:53.665 --> 02:22:58.308]  Can you guys put that back on my monitor here, just so I can have it in the corner of my eye?
[02:22:58.308 --> 02:23:07.236]  Now, I don't know where these comments are coming from, I have to be honest with you, but they're saying
[02:23:09.031 --> 02:23:12.413]  Roger Stone says Michael Cohen is lying about his conversations with Trump and WikiLeaks.
[02:23:12.413 --> 02:23:15.394]  Well, he has said that in the past.
[02:23:15.394 --> 02:23:20.456]  The judge removed his First Amendment right, so I don't know if this is a new thing or an old thing they're drumming up.
[02:23:20.456 --> 02:23:22.858]  But, oh!
[02:23:22.858 --> 02:23:25.639]  An official statement from WikiLeaks?
[02:23:25.639 --> 02:23:32.942]  Michael Cohen is lying about Roger Stone and Julian Assange.
[02:23:32.942 --> 02:23:33.603]  But, again.
[02:23:36.790 --> 02:23:47.015]  Even if, and he didn't, but even if Roger was on the phone with Julian Assange, so were so many other people in the media.
[02:23:47.015 --> 02:23:49.477]  Anderson Cooper, Brian Stelter, Glenn Greenwald.
[02:23:49.477 --> 02:23:50.937]  And I have no problem with those.
[02:23:50.937 --> 02:23:52.118]  I have no problem with Glenn Greenwald.
[02:23:52.118 --> 02:23:54.379]  I have no problem with Anderson Cooper interviewing Julian Assange.
[02:23:54.379 --> 02:23:57.101]  I have no problem with Brian Stelter interviewing Julian Assange.
[02:23:57.101 --> 02:24:01.143]  I think Cassandra Fairbanks gets a lot of exclusive access to Julian Assange.
[02:24:01.143 --> 02:24:03.584]  Is Cassandra Fairbanks a bad person now too?
[02:24:03.584 --> 02:24:04.204]  Of course not!
[02:24:04.204 --> 02:24:04.885]  She's a journalist!
[02:24:05.942 --> 02:24:18.094]  Oh but see, Roger Stone is within one degree of separation from Trump and they have to destroy everyone that has any influence within one degree of separation from Trump.
[02:24:18.094 --> 02:24:24.300]  And so Michael Cohen has basically admitted today he took a plea deal to come out here and lie about Trump.
[02:24:26.567 --> 02:24:29.690]  And again, you see how the whole thing was orchestrated.
[02:24:29.690 --> 02:24:32.393]  What was in the media last night before the testimony?
[02:24:32.393 --> 02:24:36.397]  Michael Cohen prepared to call Trump a con man and a racist.
[02:24:36.397 --> 02:24:38.439]  What did he say in his opening statements?
[02:24:38.439 --> 02:24:40.360]  Trump is a con man and a racist.
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:42.763]  How did the media get that?
[02:24:42.763 --> 02:24:49.750]  How did all the media get Michael Cohen's testimony before the Republican members of the committee?
[02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.790]  Oh.
[02:24:53.001 --> 02:24:53.802]  Hmm.
[02:24:53.802 --> 02:24:58.406]  How did CNN show up at Roger Stone's house?
[02:24:58.406 --> 02:24:59.667]  Hmm.
[02:24:59.667 --> 02:25:03.610]  Are you beginning to see a pattern, folks?
[02:25:03.610 --> 02:25:04.872]  Oh.
[02:25:04.872 --> 02:25:06.553]  Oh.
[02:25:06.553 --> 02:25:13.980]  And by the way, Mr. Elijah Cummings, who's the head of the committee, he broke the rules and then lied about it.
[02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:15.221]  Republican members of the committee
[02:25:17.057 --> 02:25:25.784]  By rule of the committee, must have the witness's testimony 24 hours before the testimony is given to the committee.
[02:25:25.784 --> 02:25:29.107]  They got it less than two hours before.
[02:25:29.107 --> 02:25:31.949]  CNN and the mainstream media had it last night!
[02:25:31.949 --> 02:25:36.453]  The Democrats wrote it!
[02:25:36.453 --> 02:25:38.755]  See what's going on here, folks?
[02:25:38.755 --> 02:25:42.958]  There's your real collusion, right there.
[02:25:42.958 --> 02:25:44.620]  And, you know, by the way,
[02:25:46.974 --> 02:25:49.617]  They're trying to drum up the Russian collusion narrative again.
[02:25:49.617 --> 02:25:50.998]  It's like a soft drumming right now.
[02:25:50.998 --> 02:25:55.103]  It's like a... Russian collusion.
[02:25:55.103 --> 02:25:58.327]  Because they want to bring it back and they want to be like this.
[02:25:58.327 --> 02:25:59.308]  But guess what?
[02:25:59.308 --> 02:25:59.668]  What was it?
[02:25:59.668 --> 02:26:03.893]  Like 48 hours ago, Putin talked about nuking the United States?
[02:26:03.893 --> 02:26:04.193]  I mean, wow!
[02:26:06.863 --> 02:26:15.748]  And then they have all these other weird things like Trump organized this meeting, Trump organized that meeting to try to get the dirt from WikiLeaks to know what WikiLeaks was going to publish.
[02:26:15.748 --> 02:26:23.013]  If he was in coordination with WikiLeaks, why does he have to go to outside sources to get info from WikiLeaks?
[02:26:23.013 --> 02:26:24.734]  It doesn't make sense!
[02:26:24.734 --> 02:26:32.819]  If he's colluding with Putin, why does he have to go to Julian Assange to get dirt on Clinton that apparently Putin has?
[02:26:32.819 --> 02:26:35.881]  It doesn't matter that there's no logic or reasoning to these claims.
[02:26:36.877 --> 02:26:47.027]  Because the average audience member of the left that believes it, has no logic or reasoning!
[02:26:47.027 --> 02:26:57.618]  And so, it should be interesting to see though, as Trump is in Vietnam right now, in talks with Kim Jong-un and North Korea,
[02:26:58.621 --> 02:27:10.425]  What if like, and this is just, it's like, what if there's some major peace deal agreed upon with North Korea, South Korea, Trump involved in negotiating it and everything, and we officially end the Korean War?
[02:27:10.425 --> 02:27:16.087]  Would that just like totally trump this whole Cohen circus today?
[02:27:16.087 --> 02:27:24.930]  And they probably wanted this thing to obviously trump everything else that's going on right now, including the peace talks with North Korea.
[02:27:27.659 --> 02:27:32.223]  But Trump can always steal the narrative, can't he?
[02:27:32.223 --> 02:27:37.627]  And again, here's what these people don't realize.
[02:27:37.627 --> 02:27:42.471]  They are so sick of the garbage from the political establishment.
[02:27:42.471 --> 02:27:47.335]  They're so sick of the garbage from the mainstream media.
[02:27:47.335 --> 02:27:50.778]  It's not even about Trump anymore.
[02:27:50.778 --> 02:27:55.182]  It's about the fact that we elected Trump and we wanted Trump in office.
[02:27:55.182 --> 02:27:56.123]  That's what it's about.
[02:27:59.011 --> 02:28:02.153]  That's what they don't understand.
[02:28:02.153 --> 02:28:05.274]  They still think they have control.
[02:28:05.274 --> 02:28:07.075]  They don't.
[02:28:07.075 --> 02:28:12.118]  The mainstream media in America is less trusted now than it's ever been.
[02:28:12.118 --> 02:28:14.479]  And that's saying something.
[02:28:14.479 --> 02:28:23.444]  America's... The view that the world has of America, around the world, is better now than it has been in my whole life.
[02:28:23.444 --> 02:28:24.224]  Why?
[02:28:24.224 --> 02:28:25.985]  Because Americans are calling out the fake news.
[02:28:28.629 --> 02:28:33.632]  Because Americans elected a real leader.
[02:28:33.632 --> 02:28:35.233]  And again, Trump's not perfect.
[02:28:35.233 --> 02:28:38.395]  Who knows what Trump's legacy ends up being.
[02:28:38.395 --> 02:28:42.658]  But Trump is the current representation of we the people.
[02:28:42.658 --> 02:28:44.359]  That's how it is.
[02:28:44.359 --> 02:28:48.221]  And so when they go after Trump, they go after we the people.
[02:28:48.221 --> 02:28:51.123]  And all they're doing is angering Trump's base.
[02:28:51.123 --> 02:28:52.164]  We don't care!
[02:28:52.164 --> 02:28:53.505]  We just hate the fake news!
[02:28:55.066 --> 02:28:57.427]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?

[02:29:00.307 --> 02:29:05.369]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:29:05.369 --> 02:29:12.551]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.551 --> 02:29:17.092]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:29:17.691 --> 02:29:21.333]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:21.333 --> 02:29:24.455]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.455 --> 02:29:27.096]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:29:27.096 --> 02:29:28.597]  Get sober now.

[02:32:11.552 --> 02:32:20.558]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:32:20.558 --> 02:32:29.926]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[02:32:30.606 --> 02:32:34.548]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[02:32:34.548 --> 02:32:40.510]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[02:32:40.510 --> 02:32:43.531]  Call and talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[02:32:43.531 --> 02:32:45.032]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:32:45.032 --> 02:32:48.233]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[02:32:48.233 --> 02:32:54.636]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[02:32:59.196 --> 02:33:01.818]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:16.807 --> 02:33:17.948]  Big Brother.
[02:33:17.948 --> 02:33:19.750]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:21.631]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:21.631 --> 02:33:23.333]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:23.333 --> 02:33:24.994]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:24.994 --> 02:33:30.119]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.119 --> 02:33:34.523]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:34.523 --> 02:33:42.230]  Alright, the Michael Cohen testimony has just concluded.
[02:33:43.826 --> 02:33:44.707]  Let's see.
[02:33:44.707 --> 02:33:47.149]  Started 10 o'clock local.
[02:33:47.149 --> 02:33:47.509]  Went to 133.
[02:33:47.509 --> 02:33:49.851]  So what are we looking at?
[02:33:49.851 --> 02:33:55.596]  About three and a half hours of testimony today with a 15-minute recess.
[02:33:55.596 --> 02:34:00.540]  A total Democrat deep state orchestrated event.
[02:34:00.540 --> 02:34:03.602]  Clear and present.
[02:34:03.602 --> 02:34:08.286]  And they don't understand that we are on to their tricks now.
[02:34:08.286 --> 02:34:10.468]  Or they're so arrogant they think they can still get away with it.
[02:34:12.039 --> 02:34:17.603]  Well, they're not getting away with it, and many people are hammering back against them on social media.
[02:34:17.603 --> 02:34:34.875]  Not only Julian Assange WikiLeaks making a statement saying that Michael Cohen lied about a phone call with Roger Stone, you also have people pointing out that Roger Stone was talking about Hillary Clinton emails, not the Podesta emails, and they refused to clarify between the two.
[02:34:34.875 --> 02:34:39.138]  But of course, it's all a big hoax anyway.
[02:34:39.138 --> 02:34:40.339]  It's all a big hoax.
[02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:44.251]  They are in contact with WikiLeaks all the time.
[02:34:44.251 --> 02:34:45.072]  It's Julian Assange.
[02:34:45.072 --> 02:34:53.716]  It's a big national news story.
[02:34:53.716 --> 02:35:02.081]  We've got this powerful, powerful report from Robert Barnes that I don't even know if we're going to have time to air today.
[02:35:03.573 --> 02:35:08.114]  But it's just like we're sitting on so much right now and there's so much news to get to.
[02:35:08.114 --> 02:35:15.356]  Plus we've got Alex Jones eventually joining us from a secret location on a secret mission.
[02:35:15.356 --> 02:35:18.477]  And it's like I don't even do the due diligence of making sure I'm plugging.
[02:35:18.477 --> 02:35:19.717]  I got so much news on my desk.
[02:35:19.717 --> 02:35:20.878]  I'm filtering through it all.
[02:35:20.878 --> 02:35:23.198]  I can't even find the stories I'm looking for.
[02:35:23.198 --> 02:35:29.040]  But I've still got reaction to the Cohen testimony here and some of the notes that I took earlier today.
[02:35:30.624 --> 02:35:32.708]  I mean, it's unbelievable!
[02:35:32.708 --> 02:35:36.115]  Cohen is basically admitting the whole thing's a Democrat-run event!
[02:35:36.115 --> 02:35:37.858]  He's like, yeah, I'm meeting with Democrats!
[02:35:37.858 --> 02:35:41.284]  He's like, yeah, I'll reach any sort of plea deal to protect my family!
[02:35:44.025 --> 02:35:48.467]  Here's the thing, they got Cohen, folks, on things outside of his stuff with Trump.
[02:35:48.467 --> 02:35:49.787]  That's the key to this.
[02:35:49.787 --> 02:35:57.971]  Cohen was engaged in all of this in-proprietary, his taxicab fraud company or whatever the crap was going on with that.
[02:35:57.971 --> 02:36:00.972]  He's not paying certain taxes or whatever the hell's going on.
[02:36:00.972 --> 02:36:10.116]  So it's like they got Cohen, they got him squeezed on stuff outside of Trump, but they squeeze him on that, they say, oh, we won't take you down for that, just come out and testify against Trump.
[02:36:13.345 --> 02:36:17.709]  By the way, you're a convicted liar.
[02:36:17.709 --> 02:36:19.050]  So come on and testify for us!
[02:36:19.050 --> 02:36:24.194]  I mean, do you need to know anything else about the Democrats?
[02:36:24.194 --> 02:36:32.401]  Do you need to know anything else about Elijah Cummings?
[02:36:32.401 --> 02:36:40.527]  And you know what?
[02:36:40.527 --> 02:36:42.169]  If you actually watch this whole thing,
[02:36:43.507 --> 02:36:46.509]  You'll notice something.
[02:36:46.509 --> 02:36:50.311]  What was, what was today's hearing about?
[02:36:50.311 --> 02:36:52.412]  What was today's testimony about?
[02:36:52.412 --> 02:36:56.654]  What was the precedent?
[02:36:56.654 --> 02:36:57.014]  I don't know.
[02:36:57.014 --> 02:36:58.715]  They never said one.
[02:36:58.715 --> 02:36:59.736]  There was no precedent.
[02:36:59.736 --> 02:37:02.437]  The precedent was bash Trump.
[02:37:02.437 --> 02:37:05.219]  That was literally the whole precedent.
[02:37:08.834 --> 02:37:17.101]  They never come out and said, we're trying to get to the bottom of alleged lies, or we're trying to get to the bottom of alleged this activity, or alleged that activity.
[02:37:17.101 --> 02:37:25.828]  It was, here's just a total Democrat deep state media orchestrated event, here comes Cohen, okay, sit down, let the Trump bash begin!
[02:37:25.828 --> 02:37:27.409]  That's all it was!
[02:37:27.409 --> 02:37:29.711]  That's all it was.
[02:37:30.959 --> 02:37:37.501]  No legal precedent, no precedent on an event, no precedent on a meeting, no precedent on a certain deal.
[02:37:37.501 --> 02:37:40.442]  It was just a bash Trump.
[02:37:40.442 --> 02:37:49.244]  Even in Cummings' opening statement, they never set a precedent for what they're trying to get out of this testimony.
[02:37:49.244 --> 02:37:51.945]  Think about that, folks.
[02:37:51.945 --> 02:37:55.906]  These people are so corrupt and sick and demented.
[02:37:57.540 --> 02:38:07.508]  They will use the powers in these committees, totally politicized, to try to destroy this country.
[02:38:07.508 --> 02:38:09.369]  And you know they don't give a damn.
[02:38:09.369 --> 02:38:14.793]  They don't investigate any of the crimes that happen in this government.
[02:38:14.793 --> 02:38:15.234]  Nothing!
[02:38:15.234 --> 02:38:17.996]  They get nothing!
[02:38:17.996 --> 02:38:19.317]  They murder presidents.
[02:38:19.317 --> 02:38:27.063]  They assassinate the President of the United States, and it gets covered up by the CIA, the FBI, and the American media.
[02:38:29.568 --> 02:38:30.608]  But it's all coming out.
[02:38:30.608 --> 02:38:41.313]  President Trump declassified those documents, exposed all of it.
[02:38:41.313 --> 02:38:44.455]  Look at what the Democrats are doing today!
[02:38:44.455 --> 02:38:48.797]  Colorado moves to bypass Electoral College to stop Trump.
[02:38:48.797 --> 02:38:51.078]  Will assign electoral votes to popular vote winner.
[02:38:51.078 --> 02:38:54.359]  They're not the first state to suggest removing the Electoral College!
[02:38:56.837 --> 02:39:04.641]  They thought they could rig the voting process with the Electoral College by turning California, Texas, New York, Illinois blue forever.
[02:39:04.641 --> 02:39:08.063]  And Florida with illegal immigration.
[02:39:08.063 --> 02:39:09.884]  Well, Trump's trying to put an end to that.
[02:39:09.884 --> 02:39:12.265]  America's sick of illegal immigration.
[02:39:12.265 --> 02:39:15.627]  So now they've realized, okay, that plan didn't work.
[02:39:15.627 --> 02:39:18.649]  Now we just have to override the Electoral College.
[02:39:18.649 --> 02:39:24.072]  Just like they have to override the Supreme Court by having Ruth Bader Ginsburg in there who's barely even alive.
[02:39:25.831 --> 02:39:28.774]  I mean, these people are sick!
[02:39:28.774 --> 02:39:30.715]  Nebraska State Senator calls the U.S.
[02:39:30.715 --> 02:39:32.617]  flag a rag!
[02:39:32.617 --> 02:39:42.345]  Senator Ernie Chambers says that the American rag means nothing to him.
[02:39:42.345 --> 02:39:45.748]  So that's what we deal with in this Congress.
[02:39:45.748 --> 02:39:53.395]  And, you know... The problem is...
[02:39:55.757 --> 02:40:00.479]  Most people in Congress are cowards.
[02:40:00.479 --> 02:40:12.783]  Whether that be just fundamentally they're cowards, or they have to engage in cowardice because of the way they got into office, or they're blackmailed, or whatever the heck is going on, folks, or they're just, I mean, they're just cowards!
[02:40:12.783 --> 02:40:23.187]  It's really what this comes down to, and it's really easy to see the men and women in Congress that aren't cowards, isn't it?
[02:40:24.522 --> 02:40:25.523]  It's really easy to see.
[02:40:25.523 --> 02:40:28.004]  Matt Gaetz.
[02:40:28.004 --> 02:40:31.907]  Jim Jordan.
[02:40:31.907 --> 02:40:44.635]  And I realize while I'm watching Jim Jordan up there today, I'm seeing that and I'm like, this man needs backup.
[02:40:44.635 --> 02:40:52.920]  And I hope that we're just at the beginning stages of actually getting patriots into Congress that aren't total cowards and total frauds.
[02:40:56.351 --> 02:41:04.142]  And, you know, I don't know how effective that may or may not be in the long run, but it's necessary.
[02:41:04.142 --> 02:41:07.828]  Because they can't get away with this garbage.
[02:41:08.823 --> 02:41:11.345]  Like this testimony today.
[02:41:11.345 --> 02:41:17.589]  They can't get away with all the garbage of trying to get rid of the Electoral College, trying to, I mean, just, you name it, folks.
[02:41:17.589 --> 02:41:18.449]  Sanctuary suits.
[02:41:18.449 --> 02:41:27.295]  It's all a bunch of Democrat garbage, bunch of leftist garbage, because there aren't enough Republicans with a spine in Congress.
[02:41:27.295 --> 02:41:29.777]  There aren't enough members of Congress that have a spine.
[02:41:31.874 --> 02:41:39.338]  And you look at new reps like Dan Crenshaw and other people, and it's like, these are the people that we need in office if we're going to save this country.
[02:41:39.338 --> 02:41:46.462]  I mean, who knows how committed Trump really is to saving this country, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:41:46.462 --> 02:41:47.723]  Who really knows?
[02:41:47.723 --> 02:41:50.284]  Only time will tell.
[02:41:50.284 --> 02:41:51.065]  But in the meantime...
[02:41:52.895 --> 02:42:06.501]  When you have, I mean you want to talk about rags, when you have rags like Cummings and Raskin and Wasserman Schultz, I mean Wasserman Schultz looks like a washed up dog.
[02:42:06.501 --> 02:42:08.502]  Lizard creature.
[02:42:08.502 --> 02:42:09.703]  Yeah, put it on record.
[02:42:09.703 --> 02:42:14.505]  Owen Schroer says Debbie Wasserman Schultz is a lizard person.
[02:42:14.505 --> 02:42:15.986]  Well, put an image up of her!
[02:42:19.289 --> 02:42:31.237]  So, this is the woman who... I mean, folks, they... It's just unbelievable.
[02:42:31.237 --> 02:42:40.023]  These people literally get away with murder.
[02:42:40.023 --> 02:42:43.686]  How much longer is America going to let this happen, folks?
[02:42:44.775 --> 02:42:46.637]  We're at a breaking point.
[02:42:46.637 --> 02:42:49.900]  The people are sick of corrupt politics.
[02:42:49.900 --> 02:42:51.822]  The people are sick of corrupt media.
[02:42:51.822 --> 02:42:53.284]  I'm telling you, we are at a breaking point.
[02:42:55.265 --> 02:43:00.826]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[02:43:54.824 --> 02:44:00.249]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[02:44:00.249 --> 02:44:02.030]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[02:44:02.030 --> 02:44:03.792]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[02:44:03.792 --> 02:44:05.633]  Now, I can make them strong.

[02:44:08.996 --> 02:44:09.997]  But not once I'm gone.
[02:44:10.097 --> 02:44:15.240]  You think in this digital age, your word's going forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:20.824]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[02:44:20.824 --> 02:44:24.467]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[02:44:24.467 --> 02:44:29.430]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[02:44:29.430 --> 02:44:36.335]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[02:44:36.335 --> 02:44:39.977]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[02:44:40.097 --> 02:44:47.729]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.

[02:46:59.255 --> 02:47:01.878]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:29.912 --> 02:47:31.293]  All right, here's the deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:31.293 --> 02:47:34.015]  I got a bunch of content I still need to get to.
[02:47:34.015 --> 02:47:38.339]  Alex Jones is going to be joining us from a secret location.
[02:47:38.339 --> 02:47:41.942]  I'm also going to come in and host the War Room today as well.
[02:47:41.942 --> 02:47:49.829]  Rob Dew is going to take the first hour of the War Room that starts at Infowars.com slash show at three o'clock central every day after the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:49.829 --> 02:47:53.912]  But then I'm going to come back and host the War Room the final two hours.
[02:47:53.912 --> 02:47:57.775]  And here's what I'm going to do, because I know that the audience is just chomping at the bit.
[02:47:58.556 --> 02:48:00.177]  To talk about this.
[02:48:00.177 --> 02:48:08.904]  So, for the second hour of the War Room today, that's four o'clock to five o'clock central, I'm gonna open up the phone lines.
[02:48:08.904 --> 02:48:12.367]  Now that's a different phone line than we have here for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:12.367 --> 02:48:14.989]  I just don't have time to take calls on the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:48:14.989 --> 02:48:19.392]  I got a ton of content I gotta get to, and I gotta keep the line open for Alex Jones.
[02:48:19.392 --> 02:48:19.572]  So...
[02:48:20.999 --> 02:48:24.460]  I do want to hear from the audience and I know that you want to talk about this.
[02:48:24.460 --> 02:48:31.722]  So I am dedicating the entire second hour of the War Room today at InfoWars.com slash show to your calls.
[02:48:31.722 --> 02:48:33.023]  I promise.
[02:48:33.023 --> 02:48:34.263]  So we want to hear from you.
[02:48:34.263 --> 02:48:37.304]  We want to get your response on the Cohen testimony today.
[02:48:37.304 --> 02:48:39.024]  We're going to dedicate the second hour of the War Room.
[02:48:39.024 --> 02:48:40.245]  I'm going to take your calls.
[02:48:40.245 --> 02:48:41.845]  We're going to do that.
[02:48:41.845 --> 02:48:44.666]  Now, I also need to play
[02:48:46.337 --> 02:48:58.545]  Robert Barnes, who did a special canned recording broadcast for us yesterday, we need to air that because it's powerful.
[02:48:58.545 --> 02:49:00.406]  And you know, Robert Barnes is another example.
[02:49:00.406 --> 02:49:02.767]  We need more attorneys like Robert Barnes.
[02:49:02.767 --> 02:49:09.051]  The guy is just like a gladiator, a titan.
[02:49:09.051 --> 02:49:10.372]  And we just need more.
[02:49:12.352 --> 02:49:13.052]  And that's what I'm hoping.
[02:49:13.052 --> 02:49:21.057]  I'm hoping that this is just the beginning of the rush of patriots coming to America's defense.
[02:49:21.057 --> 02:49:28.201]  But here's one aspect of America defending itself, and that's here at InfoWars and InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:49:28.201 --> 02:49:37.507]  I mean, it may even be the perfect example, because you saw the big stories today, and look, I'm not complaining, okay?
[02:49:37.507 --> 02:49:38.307]  I really don't care.
[02:49:40.908 --> 02:49:43.229]  I'm totally banned from Facebook.
[02:49:43.229 --> 02:49:47.531]  I went on and in less than 24 hours got a Facebook ban.
[02:49:47.531 --> 02:49:51.273]  You notice how my name's not in the news though?
[02:49:51.273 --> 02:49:56.456]  You notice how it's all about every other conservative that gets quote-unquote de-boosted?
[02:49:56.456 --> 02:50:02.019]  But you know the conservatives that aren't even allowed to exist, we don't get any coverage.
[02:50:02.019 --> 02:50:03.359]  I don't get mentioned.
[02:50:03.359 --> 02:50:05.661]  I'm not allowed on Facebook.
[02:50:05.661 --> 02:50:07.041]  I'm not de-boosted.
[02:50:07.041 --> 02:50:08.002]  I'm de-platformed.
[02:50:09.255 --> 02:50:11.617]  Nobody seems to care about that.
[02:50:11.617 --> 02:50:13.819]  I'm not even complaining.
[02:50:13.819 --> 02:50:18.222]  Our audience is there for us at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:50:18.222 --> 02:50:22.125]  So they can try to de-platform us as much as they want.
[02:50:22.125 --> 02:50:25.869]  But you continue to build this platform at InfoWars.
[02:50:25.869 --> 02:50:28.671]  And I'm telling you folks, I'm being perfectly honest with you.
[02:50:29.653 --> 02:50:33.677]  And this was my philosophy a long time ago.
[02:50:33.677 --> 02:50:41.964]  And it's why, originally, when I switched to doing videos and trying to break into that, I was only on YouTube.
[02:50:41.964 --> 02:50:43.266]  And this was before YouTube was big.
[02:50:43.266 --> 02:50:46.449]  This is when everyone was on Facebook and then moving on to Twitter.
[02:50:46.449 --> 02:50:47.650]  I didn't want to do that crap.
[02:50:47.650 --> 02:50:48.831]  I didn't want to do the selfies.
[02:50:48.831 --> 02:50:52.694]  I didn't want to tell you about where I'm eating or who I'm with or what party I'm at.
[02:50:52.694 --> 02:50:55.457]  I just said, hey, I'm going to go do live videos on YouTube and talk politics.
[02:50:55.737 --> 02:50:59.539]  And if you want to come and join me and see what I have to say, then good!
[02:50:59.539 --> 02:51:01.781]  That's where I'm at now!
[02:51:01.781 --> 02:51:07.064]  If people want to find InfoWars, they know where to find us, hopefully, at InfoWars.com.
[02:51:07.064 --> 02:51:10.666]  Now, unfortunately, not everybody does, and so I get messages every day, where can I find your live streams?
[02:51:10.666 --> 02:51:11.526]  They're gone!
[02:51:11.526 --> 02:51:15.528]  InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:51:15.528 --> 02:51:19.811]  And it's only with your support at InfoWarsStore.com do we have that platform.
[02:51:21.069 --> 02:51:26.239]  Quite frankly, again, if they just totally erase me off social media, yeah, it'll suck.
[02:51:26.239 --> 02:51:30.748]  Yeah, it's gonna basically handicap me and my ability to do my work here.
[02:51:30.748 --> 02:51:32.271]  But you know what?
[02:51:32.271 --> 02:51:32.691]  Fine.
[02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:41.361]  I still have InfoWars, we still have this platform, we still have the great audience thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:51:41.361 --> 02:51:45.682]  So folks, go to InfoWarsStore.com and take advantage of some of the big specials.
[02:51:45.682 --> 02:52:00.245]  If you are the type of person like me that has boxes of protein bars in their pantry because it's a great snack on the go, it's a healthy snack on the go, it's great for a little snack before you need to exercise, it's great for a snack after you exercise.
[02:52:01.229 --> 02:52:07.114]  So I always have boxes of, you know, the top-selling, top, you know, protein bars in my pantry.
[02:52:07.114 --> 02:52:11.999]  Well, I can now replace those with the InfoWars Live Protein Bars.
[02:52:11.999 --> 02:52:16.623]  And if you get two or more boxes at InfoWarsStore.com, you get 40% off.
[02:52:16.623 --> 02:52:21.227]  But here's the great thing about this product, and really, you can do this for TurboForce too, which is 33% off right now.
[02:52:21.227 --> 02:52:21.667]  You can go buy
[02:52:26.593 --> 02:52:28.296]  A bunch of boxes of Turbo Force.
[02:52:28.296 --> 02:52:29.959]  You can go buy a bunch of boxes of...
[02:52:31.897 --> 02:52:34.539]  The Infowars Life Protein Bars.
[02:52:34.539 --> 02:52:36.680]  And put them out at your local business.
[02:52:36.680 --> 02:52:38.461]  Put them out at your local gym.
[02:52:38.461 --> 02:52:41.003]  Put them out at the local, you know, whatever.
[02:52:41.003 --> 02:52:42.443]  You own a vape shop.
[02:52:42.443 --> 02:52:43.444]  You own whatever.
[02:52:43.444 --> 02:52:44.264]  Put them out.
[02:52:44.264 --> 02:52:45.205]  Resell them.
[02:52:45.205 --> 02:52:46.386]  Make money.
[02:52:46.386 --> 02:52:47.006]  Give them away.
[02:52:47.006 --> 02:52:48.747]  Whatever you got to do.
[02:52:48.747 --> 02:52:52.589]  So that's kind of the cool thing about these two products that are on sale, that are just great products.
[02:52:52.589 --> 02:52:54.671]  I did a turbo force before the show started today.
[02:52:54.671 --> 02:52:58.293]  I'm going to have enough energy to sustain me for seven hours of broadcasting today.
[02:53:01.488 --> 02:53:03.228]  The protein bars.
[02:53:03.228 --> 02:53:05.829]  I mean, we call it chocolate peanut butter.
[02:53:05.829 --> 02:53:10.670]  It's like a double fudge brownie with a layer of peanut butter on the outside.
[02:53:10.670 --> 02:53:12.391]  I'm not a big coconut guy.
[02:53:12.391 --> 02:53:17.892]  If you like coconut, you're going to absolutely love the vanilla coconut bar.
[02:53:17.892 --> 02:53:21.153]  And it's like so hearty, you could eat half of it and be full.
[02:53:22.677 --> 02:53:30.219]  But I'm a chocolate, I'm a chocolate head, and I try not to eat so much chocolate, but I really could just eat chocolate all day.
[02:53:30.219 --> 02:53:40.501]  And so I'm a big fan of the Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar, which again, it's basically a double fudge brownie with peanuts in it and a peanut butter coating.
[02:53:40.501 --> 02:53:43.162]  And you bite into it and you're like, this is a protein bar?
[02:53:43.162 --> 02:53:49.043]  This tastes like a double fudge brownie that I just got from a five-star restaurant that costs 20 bucks.
[02:53:51.058 --> 02:53:52.759]  So it's the InfoWars Life Protein Bars.
[02:53:52.759 --> 02:53:57.363]  Replace the protein bars that you have in your pantry with the InfoWars Life Protein Bars today.
[02:53:57.363 --> 02:53:58.804]  15 grams of protein.
[02:53:58.804 --> 02:54:04.729]  I went and I looked, and again, I get the most popular top protein bars and put them in my pantry.
[02:54:04.729 --> 02:54:06.430]  I think it had eight grams of protein in it.
[02:54:06.430 --> 02:54:10.353]  I mean, the most I think I'd ever seen was like 12.
[02:54:10.353 --> 02:54:13.756]  This has 15 and it still tastes great.
[02:54:13.756 --> 02:54:17.378]  So it's the InfoWars Life Protein Bar at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:54:17.378 --> 02:54:19.160]  And literally,
[02:54:20.407 --> 02:54:25.409]  Literally, we don't have a platform if you don't shop at Infowarsstore.com, folks.
[02:54:25.409 --> 02:54:27.790]  We have nothing.
[02:54:27.790 --> 02:54:29.450]  So, God bless you for your support.
[02:54:29.450 --> 02:54:29.990]  I salute you.
[02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:32.091]  Please continue to support us at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:54:32.091 --> 02:54:37.813]  Get the hats, get the t-shirts, get the supplements, get the water filters, get the air filters, get the protein bars, get the TurboForce.
[02:54:37.813 --> 02:54:40.454]  It's all at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:54:40.454 --> 02:54:43.935]  Okay.
[02:54:43.935 --> 02:54:47.196]  Where do I want to go here in the last three minutes?
[02:54:47.196 --> 02:54:48.396]  I mean, there's literally so much.
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:55.503]  I'm not even going to have time to do it, to get to all these clips from the Cohen hearing.
[02:54:55.503 --> 02:54:59.225]  In fact, let's just spike those because the mainstream media will do that.
[02:54:59.225 --> 02:55:04.308]  So here's what I will do.
[02:55:04.308 --> 02:55:16.995]  What I will do is give some final comments here and then be prepared in the next hour to hear from Alex Jones and to play the Robert Barnes
[02:55:19.161 --> 02:55:42.498]  Transmission that we have not aired yet, but You have to notice something The Democrats just based off body language and approach our total authoritarians because
[02:55:44.597 --> 02:55:46.677]  Look at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
[02:55:46.677 --> 02:55:53.879]  She wants this Green New Deal, which is, I mean, literally, it's just, we have to destroy America.
[02:55:53.879 --> 02:55:54.399]  That's what it is.
[02:55:54.399 --> 02:55:55.239]  It's destroy America.
[02:55:55.239 --> 02:56:02.240]  Stop all of our travel, destroy all of our buildings, stop all of our growth and prosperity, and basically we all have to be cave dwellers.
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:06.841]  Of course, Cortez goes out to fancy, you know, big restaurants where they serve meat.
[02:56:06.841 --> 02:56:08.761]  Cortez has multiple apartments now, too.
[02:56:08.761 --> 02:56:10.601]  She's getting $10 million deals.
[02:56:10.601 --> 02:56:12.742]  So, you know, she's living fat and happy.
[02:56:12.742 --> 02:56:13.722]  She flies everywhere.
[02:56:14.622 --> 02:56:21.806]  But you, we have to tear your house down, take your car, and you're not allowed to travel on a plane.
[02:56:21.806 --> 02:56:28.170]  So yeah, Ocasio-Cortez then goes on air and says, I'm the boss, bitch!
[02:56:28.170 --> 02:56:31.032]  I'm the boss, bitch!
[02:56:31.032 --> 02:56:33.674]  Oh, wow, very authoritarian of you.
[02:56:33.674 --> 02:56:38.997]  A true communist, a true fascist.
[02:56:38.997 --> 02:56:40.278]  You know, and it hit me last night.
[02:56:41.803 --> 02:56:48.588]  With all this anti-fascist garbage, with these fake anti-fascists that go out in the street claiming they're anti-fascist.
[02:56:48.588 --> 02:56:51.550]  It was so obvious, but it's like everything else these people do.
[02:56:51.550 --> 02:56:56.594]  The reason why they have these street thugs going out and claiming they're anti-fascist, they're all paid for by the fascists.
[02:56:57.811 --> 02:56:59.272]  What is fascism?
[02:56:59.272 --> 02:57:01.594]  Governments and corporations working hand-in-hand.
[02:57:01.594 --> 02:57:04.957]  That's what's been going on in this country for decades!
[02:57:04.957 --> 02:57:06.399]  There was no Antifa then!
[02:57:06.399 --> 02:57:08.480]  Then Trump gets in, now there's Antifa?
[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:09.842]  You get it yet?
[02:57:09.842 --> 02:57:13.985]  Trump is the anti-establishment candidate.
[02:57:13.985 --> 02:57:14.466]  But now...
[02:57:15.652 --> 02:57:22.193]  You can see the total authoritarianism, the total fascism of the Democrats with this Cohen testimony today.
[02:57:22.193 --> 02:57:25.774]  Cohen literally looks like a puppy dog scared for his life up there.
[02:57:25.774 --> 02:57:26.334]  And he's admitting it!
[02:57:26.334 --> 02:57:27.874]  He's like, yeah, I met with Democrats.
[02:57:27.874 --> 02:57:29.374]  I'm trying to protect my family.
[02:57:29.374 --> 02:57:33.955]  I'm up here lying about Trump because I want to protect my family and I don't want him to go after my wife.
[02:57:33.955 --> 02:57:35.815]  And I want them to leave me alone.
[02:57:35.815 --> 02:57:42.577]  So the Democrats are now open socialists, open communists, open fascists, open authoritarians, and they let babies die!
[02:57:42.577 --> 02:57:44.177]  They literally say, let that baby die!
[02:57:54.488 --> 02:58:03.493]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:58:03.493 --> 02:58:13.578]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:58:13.578 --> 02:58:22.102]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:58:22.961 --> 02:58:24.282]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:58:24.282 --> 02:58:25.442]  You must experience it.
[02:58:25.442 --> 02:58:27.403]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:58:27.403 --> 02:58:32.445]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:58:32.445 --> 02:58:33.966]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:58:33.966 --> 02:58:35.446]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[02:58:35.446 --> 02:58:42.129]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:58:42.129 --> 02:58:43.630]  TurboForce at M4sLive.com.
[02:58:46.474 --> 02:58:51.317]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:58:51.317 --> 02:59:00.782]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[02:59:00.782 --> 02:59:05.565]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[02:59:05.565 --> 02:59:15.811]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support
[02:59:15.811 --> 02:59:16.131]  I think so.
[02:59:49.251 --> 02:59:51.840]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:14.455 --> 03:00:17.136]  I'm not sure where to go here.
[03:00:17.136 --> 03:00:22.758]  Still waiting to hear from Alex Jones on a secret mission.
[03:00:22.758 --> 03:00:24.779]  We've got a massive troll laughing right now.
[03:00:24.779 --> 03:00:26.980]  I'm not sure if I'm ready to comment on that.
[03:00:26.980 --> 03:00:29.421]  In fact, let's just wait on that.
[03:00:29.421 --> 03:00:30.882]  Because the ball's not in our court.
[03:00:30.882 --> 03:00:31.902]  So let me just do
[03:00:44.189 --> 03:00:54.732]  Well let me just say this, and then I swear I'm going to move on from this Cohen stuff until we take your calls on the war room here.
[03:00:54.732 --> 03:01:04.375]  I'm beginning to wonder how much Trump realized before he ran for president.
[03:01:04.375 --> 03:01:10.857]  And I'm not saying I'm taking Michael Cohen at his words, I'm just saying you have to admit that this Cohen testimony
[03:01:12.358 --> 03:01:23.403]  Absorbing it all does add some perspective or gives you some sort of new information to try to process.
[03:01:23.403 --> 03:01:26.405]  And so there were two things I realized.
[03:01:26.405 --> 03:01:38.631]  One is how much does Trump really, how much did Trump really know what he was getting into and how much does he really even know to this moment?
[03:01:38.631 --> 03:01:39.111]  Because
[03:01:41.914 --> 03:01:49.576]  If you take anything, if you take Cohen at his word, basically Trump has, he was just clueless upon everything, basically.
[03:01:49.576 --> 03:01:54.478]  Of course, Cohen is a known liar, I mean, he contradicted himself in his own statements multiple times today.
[03:01:54.478 --> 03:02:10.103]  For example, he says, in the same, this was unbelievable, because Cohen's obviously not a dumb guy, I mean, a successful lawyer, but he caught himself contradicting himself today, and he goes, President Trump never wanted to win, and he never thought he was gonna win.
[03:02:11.277 --> 03:02:20.164]  And then in the same sentence, he said he was so desperate to win that he would have done anything to win, including collude with Russia.
[03:02:20.164 --> 03:02:23.246]  And then he realized, oh, I just contradicted myself.
[03:02:23.246 --> 03:02:26.409]  But he really never expected to win, and he didn't want to win.
[03:02:26.409 --> 03:02:35.576]  Even though I just said he would do anything to win, even colluding with Russia, he didn't want to win.
[03:02:35.576 --> 03:02:37.398]  But I already knew this.
[03:02:38.473 --> 03:02:41.575]  But it just kind of solidified itself for me today.
[03:02:41.575 --> 03:02:43.516]  The Trump movement is not about Trump, folks.
[03:02:43.516 --> 03:02:48.939]  Trump is just, he is just, he is just the visual figurehead, the vocal figurehead.
[03:02:48.939 --> 03:02:53.202]  And the reason why Trump is so untouchable is because Trump just, it's not even Trump.
[03:02:53.202 --> 03:02:56.464]  Trump represents us.
[03:02:56.464 --> 03:02:57.865]  We elected Trump.
[03:02:57.865 --> 03:02:59.065]  You told us we couldn't have him.
[03:02:59.065 --> 03:02:59.866]  We elected him.
[03:02:59.866 --> 03:03:00.726]  Screw you!
[03:03:00.726 --> 03:03:03.308]  And now you're trying to tell us we can't have him even after we elected him?
[03:03:03.308 --> 03:03:05.009]  Screw you again!
[03:03:05.009 --> 03:03:06.190]  So that's what they don't understand!
[03:03:10.265 --> 03:03:12.086]  But that's where we're at.
[03:03:12.086 --> 03:03:17.730]  And again, folks, if they think, like, I'm wondering, I mean, they have nothing on Trump.
[03:03:17.730 --> 03:03:21.292]  I mean, they have nothing.
[03:03:21.292 --> 03:03:29.617]  And if Cohen, if this Cohen testimony is their big thing, I mean, folks, this is a joke.
[03:03:29.617 --> 03:03:31.298]  So what is Elijah Cummings thinking?
[03:03:31.298 --> 03:03:33.460]  Is he thinking, I'm going to make my big mark here.
[03:03:35.154 --> 03:03:44.017]  And we're gonna have the bombshell testimony that's gonna destroy Trump and give us the cause for articles of impeachment here?
[03:03:44.017 --> 03:03:47.038]  That's not gonna work.
[03:03:47.038 --> 03:03:52.780]  But it's like, do they still, they still don't get it, do they?
[03:03:52.780 --> 03:04:03.964]  They really, see because here's the, pretty much almost anybody you see these days is made by the establishment, is made by the media.
[03:04:06.846 --> 03:04:13.452]  And so, that means that they have the ability to either destroy or inflate their own creation.
[03:04:13.452 --> 03:04:14.993]  Just look at a Cortez.
[03:04:14.993 --> 03:04:16.715]  If the Democrats want her out, they'll get her out.
[03:04:16.715 --> 03:04:18.937]  You may find that out soon enough.
[03:04:18.937 --> 03:04:21.599]  But see, with Trump, it was organic.
[03:04:21.599 --> 03:04:22.980]  They never wanted Trump.
[03:04:22.980 --> 03:04:24.902]  They told us we couldn't have Trump from the beginning.
[03:04:24.902 --> 03:04:27.444]  They told us Trump would never win from the beginning.
[03:04:27.444 --> 03:04:30.126]  So, they didn't make Trump the president.
[03:04:30.126 --> 03:04:30.587]  We did!
[03:04:31.587 --> 03:04:33.749]  But see, they made everyone else the president.
[03:04:33.749 --> 03:04:35.710]  They made everyone else popular.
[03:04:35.710 --> 03:04:40.133]  So with their own playbook, they think they can destroy anything.
[03:04:40.133 --> 03:04:44.596]  But they can't destroy Trump because they didn't make Trump.
[03:04:44.596 --> 03:04:46.298]  And that's their Achilles heel.
[03:04:46.298 --> 03:04:48.639]  That's why they're frustrated so much.
[03:04:48.639 --> 03:04:51.942]  That's why they hate us.
[03:04:51.942 --> 03:04:58.587]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship.
[03:04:59.326 --> 03:05:07.851]  And I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[03:05:07.851 --> 03:05:20.197]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[03:05:20.197 --> 03:05:22.118]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:05:22.118 --> 03:05:24.800]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:05:26.169 --> 03:05:30.490]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:05:30.490 --> 03:05:34.751]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[03:05:34.751 --> 03:05:37.012]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:05:37.012 --> 03:05:39.332]  This country is in a war!
[03:05:39.332 --> 03:05:50.035]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:05:50.035 --> 03:05:53.616]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[03:05:57.591 --> 03:06:03.075]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Owen Troyer.
[03:06:03.075 --> 03:06:05.776]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:05.776 --> 03:06:09.099]  Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[03:06:09.099 --> 03:06:11.640]  Still waiting to hear from Alex Jones, who's on a secret mission.
[03:06:11.640 --> 03:06:20.326]  And then also, we're going to play some clips from Robert Barnes, who recorded some powerful segments here at InfoWars yesterday.
[03:06:20.326 --> 03:06:24.389]  But I'm going to do a news blitz here, so we don't leave any stone uncovered.
[03:06:25.606 --> 03:06:26.966]  No rhyme or reason to this, folks.
[03:06:26.966 --> 03:06:30.868]  I'm just picking up a new story, covering it, and moving on.
[03:06:30.868 --> 03:06:36.449]  From Sputnik, all UK adults soon presumed organ donors under new law.
[03:06:36.449 --> 03:06:40.450]  And you know, this is one of those things that on the surface feels right and appears right.
[03:06:40.450 --> 03:06:41.931]  It's kind of a no-brainer.
[03:06:41.931 --> 03:06:46.732]  Folks, they're harvesting these organs, they're selling these organs, they're profiting off of these organs.
[03:06:46.732 --> 03:06:49.273]  And if you really want to know something's sick,
[03:06:50.401 --> 03:06:56.525]  You wanna know why the Democrats want to allow babies to just die after they're born?
[03:06:56.525 --> 03:06:58.487]  I mean, think about this.
[03:06:58.487 --> 03:07:11.956]  Did you know, I forget what it is, but if there's an animal, if you find an animal and it's like dying or something, it's like a thing, you have to fix the animal.
[03:07:11.956 --> 03:07:14.858]  If that animal can live, you have to give treatment to that animal.
[03:07:14.858 --> 03:07:18.281]  It's like the same thing, but oh, but when it's a newborn baby, just let it die.
[03:07:21.735 --> 03:07:32.784]  But do you know why they want the newborn baby to be left to die if the mother doesn't want it?
[03:07:32.784 --> 03:07:34.925]  They want those organs.
[03:07:34.925 --> 03:07:37.327]  They want to harvest that baby's organs.
[03:07:37.327 --> 03:07:42.011]  They want to harvest the adrenochrome that that baby produces in its glands.
[03:07:42.011 --> 03:07:45.233]  They want to harvest the blood of that baby, folks.
[03:07:45.233 --> 03:07:47.975]  Literally.
[03:07:47.975 --> 03:07:49.937]  Some people want to do it for profit.
[03:07:49.937 --> 03:07:51.358]  Some people want to do it for satanic
[03:07:52.887 --> 03:07:54.927]  Rituals.
[03:07:54.927 --> 03:08:06.430]  So, if you're asking yourself, why would the Democrats fight for babies to be left to die?
[03:08:06.430 --> 03:08:19.273]  Literally, folks, literally, the right to life or whatever it was that Ben Sasse put on the floor of Congress this week, just said, it's a very simple bill, it's like one sentence, it says, if a baby is born,
[03:08:20.433 --> 03:08:29.939]  If a baby is born, and it's alive, you have to make sure that you provide it treatment.
[03:08:29.939 --> 03:08:31.981]  Did not pass.
[03:08:31.981 --> 03:08:42.187]  Which now means, if a mother gives birth, an unwanted birth, and that baby's alive, they let it die.
[03:08:42.187 --> 03:08:45.089]  They do not give it medical treatment.
[03:08:45.089 --> 03:08:47.351]  They let the baby die.
[03:08:48.891 --> 03:08:50.812]  And again, this sounds nuts!
[03:08:50.812 --> 03:08:52.112]  You can't believe it!
[03:08:52.112 --> 03:08:53.173]  There's a reason!
[03:08:53.173 --> 03:09:06.418]  They harvest the baby's organs, they harvest the baby's blood, and they either sell it for profit or use it in a satanic ritual, folks!
[03:09:06.418 --> 03:09:07.778]  You know, it's sad.
[03:09:07.778 --> 03:09:09.819]  The President hasn't done more about this.
[03:09:09.819 --> 03:09:17.342]  And I predict, if there really is another hot civil war in this country, and it doesn't come from them impeaching Trump, it will be
[03:09:18.729 --> 03:09:21.272]  Over the killing of babies.
[03:09:21.272 --> 03:09:27.120]  And you will literally have the Democrats, just like they fought for slavery, just like it was the Democrats that fought for slavery, folks.
[03:09:27.120 --> 03:09:33.708]  In fact, somebody sent me an old Democrat ad, and it literally is like Democrats, party of the white man, Republican, party of the you-know-what.
[03:09:35.461 --> 03:09:38.323]  And it had a caricature of a black man on there.
[03:09:38.323 --> 03:09:39.823]  That's the Democrats, folks.
[03:09:39.823 --> 03:09:42.485]  They're the ones that were in the KKK.
[03:09:42.485 --> 03:09:45.526]  They're the ones that had Robert Byrd in Congress.
[03:09:45.526 --> 03:09:49.488]  They're the ones that kill babies.
[03:09:49.488 --> 03:10:00.214]  And so just like Americans had to fight the damn Democrats to free the slaves, we're gonna have to fight the Democrats again to make sure that babies are allowed to live.
[03:10:03.231 --> 03:10:08.695]  So there's your InfoWars next year's news today, folks.
[03:10:08.695 --> 03:10:20.363]  I bet you, eventually in this country, there will be a civil war fought, and it will be people fighting for the rights of newborn babies.
[03:10:20.363 --> 03:10:24.086]  Because we don't want to let a baby die!
[03:10:27.188 --> 03:10:30.990]  And all these Democrats and all these progressives think they're on the right side of history.
[03:10:30.990 --> 03:10:33.070]  You literally fought for slavery.
[03:10:33.070 --> 03:10:38.753]  You literally fight to let babies die.
[03:10:38.753 --> 03:10:43.015]  Democrat donor Ed Buck sued by family after overdose death.
[03:10:43.015 --> 03:10:45.776]  Yeah, just, you know, people just die in a sex dungeon.
[03:10:45.776 --> 03:10:46.916]  Nobody reports on it.
[03:10:46.916 --> 03:10:50.197]  Big Democrat donor, big friend with Adam Schiff.
[03:10:50.197 --> 03:10:53.299]  Trump finishes meeting with Kim Jong-un after very good dialogue.
[03:10:54.757 --> 03:10:56.878]  Oh, here's a rich one for you.
[03:10:56.878 --> 03:11:00.660]  John Podesta predicts Roger Stone is going to jail.
[03:11:00.660 --> 03:11:01.480]  Oh, wait a second.
[03:11:01.480 --> 03:11:05.242]  Roger Stone put out a tweet about Podesta and he got investigated for it.
[03:11:05.242 --> 03:11:07.223]  Oh, what does Roger Stone know?
[03:11:07.223 --> 03:11:09.444]  Well, what does John Podesta know?
[03:11:09.444 --> 03:11:12.066]  How can John Podesta make a prediction about Stone going to jail?
[03:11:12.066 --> 03:11:16.508]  Where's the investigation into Podesta?
[03:11:16.508 --> 03:11:20.730]  You know what Andrew Breitbart said about John Podesta?
[03:11:20.730 --> 03:11:22.791]  Andrew Breitbart, may he rest in peace.
[03:11:24.096 --> 03:11:33.179]  Andrew Breitbart no longer with us.
[03:11:33.179 --> 03:11:35.299]  He's dead.
[03:11:35.299 --> 03:11:44.182]  Why did Andrew Breitbart allege that John Podesta was a massive pedophile ring sex slave operator?
[03:11:44.182 --> 03:11:52.465]  Why was it Andrew Breitbart that said John Podesta was a massive sex child ring cover-up operative?
[03:11:52.465 --> 03:11:53.245]  Not my words!
[03:11:54.229 --> 03:11:56.611]  I mean, I don't know why podestas are into that weird art.
[03:11:56.611 --> 03:11:57.652]  That's their right.
[03:11:57.652 --> 03:12:01.897]  I don't know why the podestas are being invited to spirit cookings that have human blood involved.
[03:12:01.897 --> 03:12:05.360]  Maybe that's why they want to let babies die so they can harvest their blood.
[03:12:05.360 --> 03:12:05.681]  But again!
[03:12:07.123 --> 03:12:11.308]  I'm not the one that said John Podesta's running massive child sex slaverings.
[03:12:11.308 --> 03:12:12.369]  That was Andrew Breitbart.
[03:12:12.369 --> 03:12:12.869]  He's dead.
[03:12:12.869 --> 03:12:13.891]  Why did he say that?
[03:12:13.891 --> 03:12:21.959]  And why is it that Roger Stone gets investigated for making a tweet about Podesta, but when Podesta predicts Stone's going to jail, nobody investigates?
[03:12:21.959 --> 03:12:23.301]  Alright folks, here's the deal.
[03:12:23.301 --> 03:12:24.282]  Do we want to go live to this?
[03:12:28.439 --> 03:12:32.260]  Secret Mission has now been launched, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:12:32.260 --> 03:12:37.242]  Alex Jones is in California on the Joe Rogan Experience right now.
[03:12:37.242 --> 03:12:39.763]  Alex Jones, Sandy Hook, Dead Kids Show.
[03:12:39.763 --> 03:12:47.366]  Well, I don't think that's... I think the majority of them are angry because the narrative has been that you're sending people to these Sandy Hook family's homes.
[03:12:47.366 --> 03:12:49.127]  Exactly, and I'm not, and I never have.
[03:12:49.127 --> 03:12:54.709]  That you're responsible for these people getting harassed because you said on your radio show that it wasn't real.
[03:12:55.129 --> 03:13:03.058]  Yes, there is video and audio of me saying, I can see how people don't think it happened, and I can see how people think it's synthetic because there's been stage events before.
[03:13:03.058 --> 03:13:09.386]  That then gets edited, put together, cobbled together, but I never said go to people's houses, I never said go investigate these families.
[03:13:09.386 --> 03:13:11.408]  Did you ever say that you think it's not real?
[03:13:11.408 --> 03:13:12.269]  Yes, I did.
[03:13:12.269 --> 03:13:13.671]  But now you do think it's real?
[03:13:13.971 --> 03:13:16.714]  Because I learned some of the anomalies were not accurate.
[03:13:16.714 --> 03:13:19.437]  That's a problem with all this conspiracy shit, right?
[03:13:19.437 --> 03:13:25.923]  Because the conspiracy theory stuff, the people that want to believe, they believe in conspiracies with everything.
[03:13:25.923 --> 03:13:29.447]  And I think there's a certain percent, and we talked about this just a few minutes ago.
[03:13:29.447 --> 03:13:34.532]  Yeah, when I started getting accused four years ago, a couple years into it, I said, no, I think it happened.
[03:13:37.020 --> 03:13:41.182]  Then people that I had interviewed and things started saying, he's involved, he's one of them.
[03:13:41.182 --> 03:13:44.784]  Because you are now saying that it happened, they thought that you'd been compromised.
[03:13:44.784 --> 03:13:47.085]  Yes, and then I was realizing, oh.
[03:13:47.085 --> 03:13:47.905]  This is how it works.
[03:13:47.905 --> 03:13:49.746]  A certain percentage of people are schizophrenic.
[03:13:49.746 --> 03:13:50.526]  Exactly.
[03:13:50.526 --> 03:13:52.867]  And then they just think everything's a conspiracy.
[03:13:52.867 --> 03:13:54.368]  Well, this is the thing about conspiracies.
[03:13:54.368 --> 03:13:57.069]  It's very attractive to people that are schizophrenic.
[03:13:57.069 --> 03:14:00.151]  Schizophrenic people think everything's a fucking conspiracy, from top to bottom.
[03:14:00.691 --> 03:14:02.032]  Alright, so here's the deal, folks.
[03:14:02.032 --> 03:14:03.813]  We're going to be dumping a lot of this, obviously.
[03:14:03.813 --> 03:14:06.595]  Joe Rogan is not on terrestrial radio with a terrestrial audience.
[03:14:06.595 --> 03:14:10.177]  So we're going to have to dump some of the cursing.
[03:14:10.177 --> 03:14:12.659]  So that's just why I'm going to be popping in and out.
[03:14:12.659 --> 03:14:15.661]  But this is Alex Jones, live with Joe Rogan, right now.
[03:14:16.661 --> 03:14:25.885]  Saying that I'm Bo Bridges, or that I'm Jeff Bridges, or that I am Bill Hicks, and people in restaurants screaming, F you Bill, we know it's you.
[03:14:25.885 --> 03:14:28.346]  It's kind of like Dan Rather, the guy threatening me.
[03:14:28.346 --> 03:14:29.287]  What's the signal, Dan?
[03:14:29.287 --> 03:14:31.288]  What's the signal?
[03:14:31.288 --> 03:14:35.810]  I've experienced now the quote, fame, of being super famous being a conspiracy guy.
[03:14:35.810 --> 03:14:40.452]  I was legitimately questioning things because of Gulf of Tonkin, Northwoods, things that really happened.
[03:14:40.452 --> 03:14:42.733]  Babies that weren't thrown out of incubators against the Iraq War.
[03:14:43.393 --> 03:14:55.879]  But I kind of realized a few years ago that I kind of had my own mild psychosis in that when you've been lied to by the media and the culture so much over and over again, everything then starts becoming automatically, you're sure it's fake.
[03:14:55.879 --> 03:14:58.400]  And then everything you see fits into that.
[03:14:58.400 --> 03:15:08.505]  This is probably, again, four or five years ago, I began to realize because I was on the receiving end of people pulling up in white vans with guns at my office saying, I know you put a microchip in my head and I'm going to kill you.
[03:15:08.505 --> 03:15:11.627]  And so it was kind of like once I got super famous, it was like, whoa,
[03:15:13.359 --> 03:15:20.045]  There's a certain percentage of people that are way off on the spectrum where they believe everything's fake, and then there's people that believe everything they hear is true.
[03:15:20.045 --> 03:15:24.649]  I mean, you should be questioning, you should have the right to do it, but it's somewhere in the middle.
[03:15:25.535 --> 03:15:28.656]  And so, this is what I'll say about Sandy Hook.
[03:15:28.656 --> 03:15:33.056]  I legitimately questioned it when people brought up anomalies.
[03:15:33.056 --> 03:15:35.357]  I then had debates about it on both sides.
[03:15:35.357 --> 03:15:36.777]  The internet pushed me to keep covering it.
[03:15:36.777 --> 03:15:40.358]  I probably covered it 20 times in the first few years it happened.
[03:15:40.358 --> 03:15:45.359]  And then as soon as I questioned it, not a big statement.
[03:15:45.359 --> 03:15:46.679]  Alright, it's juicy folks.
[03:15:46.679 --> 03:15:48.139]  It's Alex Jones with Joe Rogan.
[03:15:48.139 --> 03:15:50.100]  We're going to cover it live here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:50.100 --> 03:15:51.620]  Go to Infowarsstore.com during this break.
[03:15:53.155 --> 03:15:59.816]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[03:15:59.816 --> 03:16:04.517]  Did you know the official national American flag has never been manufactured for retail stores?
[03:16:04.517 --> 03:16:06.818]  The one that Americans fought and died for.
[03:16:06.818 --> 03:16:09.618]  The one symbol that represents our Constitution.
[03:16:09.618 --> 03:16:13.059]  Now you can be a part of this great movement that's never been seen before.
[03:16:13.059 --> 03:16:15.359]  Together we'll recapture America.
[03:16:15.359 --> 03:16:16.740]  Call 1-877-383-4777 or visit theofficialflag.com
[03:16:23.081 --> 03:16:29.423]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.423 --> 03:16:32.464]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.464 --> 03:16:38.386]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.386 --> 03:16:42.187]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:42.187 --> 03:16:43.447]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.447 --> 03:16:44.788]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.788 --> 03:16:50.989]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.989 --> 03:16:52.410]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:53.097 --> 03:16:56.679]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:16:56.679 --> 03:17:00.241]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:17:00.241 --> 03:17:02.382]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:18:03.536 --> 03:18:12.544]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:18:12.544 --> 03:18:22.632]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:18:22.632 --> 03:18:31.159]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:18:31.980 --> 03:18:33.320]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:18:33.320 --> 03:18:34.481]  You must experience it.
[03:18:34.481 --> 03:18:36.461]  It is a total game-changer.
[03:18:36.461 --> 03:18:41.483]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:18:41.483 --> 03:18:43.003]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:18:43.003 --> 03:18:44.484]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:18:44.484 --> 03:18:51.165]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:18:51.165 --> 03:18:52.666]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[03:18:54.139 --> 03:18:56.381]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:18:56.381 --> 03:18:58.122]  There is no set stasis.
[03:18:58.122 --> 03:18:59.363]  There is no managed system.
[03:18:59.363 --> 03:19:01.024]  There is no un-continuum.
[03:19:01.024 --> 03:19:04.246]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[03:19:04.246 --> 03:19:07.608]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[03:19:07.608 --> 03:19:08.849]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[03:19:08.849 --> 03:19:09.649]  We'll be here forever.
[03:19:09.649 --> 03:19:10.890]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:19:10.890 --> 03:19:17.775]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[03:19:17.775 --> 03:19:18.335]  We made it.
[03:19:18.335 --> 03:19:20.176]  And that's really where this goes.
[03:19:20.176 --> 03:19:22.318]  But God's got a big war for you ready.
[03:19:22.318 --> 03:19:22.698]  And so,
[03:19:22.898 --> 03:19:29.364]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[03:19:29.364 --> 03:19:34.409]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[03:19:34.409 --> 03:19:37.271]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:19:37.271 --> 03:19:39.674]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:19:39.674 --> 03:19:43.177]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[03:19:43.177 --> 03:19:44.198]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:19:44.438 --> 03:19:48.722]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[03:19:48.722 --> 03:19:51.604]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[03:19:51.604 --> 03:19:52.685]  I want life!
[03:19:52.685 --> 03:19:56.708]  I want Jesus!
[03:19:56.708 --> 03:19:59.831]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:09.420 --> 03:20:21.545]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have to preempt our powerful broadcast from Robert Barnes, but we've gone ahead and posted the broadcast in full at Infowars.com.
[03:20:21.545 --> 03:20:24.267]  This is one you're not going to want to miss, folks.
[03:20:24.267 --> 03:20:33.371]  Constitutional lawyer breaks down how the deep state targets and silences conservatives with Robert Barnes, one of the smartest attorneys that you'll ever hear from.
[03:20:33.991 --> 03:20:37.136]  And so that is now posted in full at InfoWars.com.
[03:20:37.136 --> 03:20:37.977]  We have to preempt that.
[03:20:37.977 --> 03:20:43.365]  We now go back live to Alex Jones on the Joe Rogan experience.
[03:20:43.365 --> 03:20:45.087]  Is it the Snake Farm?
[03:20:45.087 --> 03:20:47.611]  Is Alex Jones the Snake Wrangler?
[03:20:47.611 --> 03:20:48.352]  Let's go live now.
[03:20:48.919 --> 03:20:50.320]  Do not say that!
[03:20:50.320 --> 03:20:51.281]  I'm gonna get killed!
[03:20:51.281 --> 03:20:57.065]  I mean, I have never said nobody died at Parkland, and I sure as hell didn't say kill their parents.
[03:20:57.065 --> 03:20:58.807]  So now, here's what I'm saying.
[03:20:58.807 --> 03:21:03.991]  You talk about fake news, they have green-lighted making anything you can imagine up about me.
[03:21:03.991 --> 03:21:06.993]  And it's like insane.
[03:21:06.993 --> 03:21:08.474]  And that's all I'm saying is that
[03:21:10.404 --> 03:21:13.166]  At a certain point, it's like, Jesus!
[03:21:13.166 --> 03:21:14.126]  I get it.
[03:21:14.126 --> 03:21:15.587]  Let's take this step by step.
[03:21:15.587 --> 03:21:16.107]  I'm sorry.
[03:21:16.107 --> 03:21:18.268]  It's okay.
[03:21:18.268 --> 03:21:28.333]  We want to give you an opportunity to communicate and clear the air and talk and some of the shit that you and I talked about earlier.
[03:21:28.333 --> 03:21:30.014]  There's a bunch of things going on.
[03:21:30.014 --> 03:21:33.456]  One, it's a story that attracts people's attention.
[03:21:34.778 --> 03:21:35.879]  Right?
[03:21:35.879 --> 03:21:40.605]  A story of a guy who's saying that people didn't get killed when they did get killed.
[03:21:40.605 --> 03:21:43.128]  And it's horrific for people to look at.
[03:21:43.128 --> 03:21:49.915]  It's horrific to people to think about that their own children will not only get murdered, but then someone would accuse them of being a crisis actor.
[03:21:49.915 --> 03:21:55.221]  So then they start pushing that story, and that story becomes something that they make money off of.
[03:21:55.822 --> 03:21:58.403]  Which is really, in some ways, kind of ironic.
[03:21:58.403 --> 03:22:05.526]  They keep this story in the news, and they keep getting clicks off of you and misrepresenting some of the things that you've said.
[03:22:05.526 --> 03:22:06.627]  Yes, and Joe, that's right.
[03:22:06.627 --> 03:22:10.008]  But some of the things that you've said, you wish you hadn't said, too.
[03:22:10.008 --> 03:22:10.648]  Absolutely.
[03:22:10.648 --> 03:22:12.189]  That's also real.
[03:22:12.189 --> 03:22:14.230]  But, I mean, let's be clear.
[03:22:14.230 --> 03:22:15.750]  I'm not even defending myself.
[03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:17.251]  People learn stuff as you get older.
[03:22:17.251 --> 03:22:19.452]  In hindsight, you're like, well, why did I do that?
[03:22:19.452 --> 03:22:21.833]  Like, I used to, whatever was the big hot thing on the internet,
[03:22:23.101 --> 03:22:25.143]  I would just debate it because it was interesting.
[03:22:25.143 --> 03:22:26.824]  But this is what I wanted to get to.
[03:22:26.824 --> 03:22:31.608]  You were doing this show, and in this show you're on the air hours and hours a day.
[03:22:31.608 --> 03:22:34.930]  And you're ranting about all these various things.
[03:22:34.930 --> 03:22:41.436]  Is it fair to say that you weren't really 100% aware of what kind of influence you were having?
[03:22:41.436 --> 03:22:42.176]  Absolutely.
[03:22:42.176 --> 03:22:46.520]  If you did know, you would have phrased things differently and done things differently.
[03:22:47.216 --> 03:22:48.637]  You know, it's even beyond that.
[03:22:48.637 --> 03:22:53.540]  I was just younger, and I was covering what other people were saying.
[03:22:53.540 --> 03:22:56.382]  I was not the first, the tenth, the hundredth, the ten thousandth.
[03:22:56.382 --> 03:22:57.603]  You were reading about it on the internet?
[03:22:57.603 --> 03:23:03.307]  It was a firestorm all over the news that people are denying it, and I've got producers going, hey, look at this video.
[03:23:03.507 --> 03:23:07.028]  But isn't that the problem with every single national tragedy?
[03:23:07.028 --> 03:23:11.509]  Anytime something happens, there's a certain amount of people that think that there's a conspiracy.
[03:23:11.509 --> 03:23:13.169]  Even when it's just a plane crash.
[03:23:13.169 --> 03:23:15.950]  Even when it's just... fill in the blanks.
[03:23:15.950 --> 03:23:17.530]  Any sort of national tragedy.
[03:23:17.530 --> 03:23:17.931]  Well, exactly.
[03:23:17.931 --> 03:23:21.872]  And all I'm saying is, Sandy Hook's not the hill I'm dying on.
[03:23:24.302 --> 03:23:49.424]  I support people's right to question and I understand because there's been so much lying in corporate media and by governments and staged events that are admittedly classified that once people see that one thing was staged then everything else must be staged and then I have been on the receiving end of literally thousands of made-up conspiracies which you laugh at until people in a truck with guns show up.
[03:23:49.424 --> 03:23:50.124]  Yeah.
[03:23:50.124 --> 03:23:51.386]  And so I understand
[03:23:52.998 --> 03:24:00.784]  Part of this is the complex world we live in, all the information we have more than ever, and a lot of it is all the drugs people are on.
[03:24:02.274 --> 03:24:04.156]  A lot of it is schizophrenics.
[03:24:04.156 --> 03:24:05.657]  This is a big problem.
[03:24:05.657 --> 03:24:09.641]  I mean, we were talking about the percentage of human beings.
[03:24:09.641 --> 03:24:13.685]  Half of Brazil has the brain worm that makes you basically psychotic.
[03:24:13.685 --> 03:24:15.066]  Well, it doesn't make you psychotic.
[03:24:15.066 --> 03:24:16.487]  It makes you risk-taking, crazy.
[03:24:16.487 --> 03:24:17.568]  It affects your judgment.
[03:24:17.568 --> 03:24:18.149]  This is toxic.
[03:24:18.149 --> 03:24:20.651]  It programs you to want to have more cats, smell piss.
[03:24:20.651 --> 03:24:21.311]  Yes.
[03:24:21.311 --> 03:24:23.594]  Well, it definitely does that to rats.
[03:24:23.594 --> 03:24:27.157]  It actually reprograms rats' brains, makes them sexually attractive to smell cat piss.
[03:24:27.157 --> 03:24:28.138]  And there's a bunch of parasites.
[03:24:28.678 --> 03:24:31.339]  Yes, there's a bunch of them, and there's some that probably haven't even been identified.
[03:24:31.339 --> 03:24:33.600]  And that's where the whole crazy cat litter thing comes from.
[03:24:33.600 --> 03:24:34.960]  Yes, that's exactly what it is.
[03:24:34.960 --> 03:24:38.161]  It's one of the reasons why they tell women when they're pregnant to stay the fuck away from cat litter.
[03:24:38.161 --> 03:24:40.382]  Don't touch cat litter, don't go anywhere near cats.
[03:24:40.382 --> 03:24:43.863]  We have to dump some stuff here as we're covering the Joe Rogan Show live.
[03:24:43.863 --> 03:24:46.424]  Alex Jones back on the Joe Rogan Show.
[03:24:46.424 --> 03:24:51.085]  We just have to bump in and out here whenever there's cursing so that we can dump it.
[03:24:51.085 --> 03:24:52.385]  But let's go back live now.
[03:24:52.385 --> 03:24:54.066]  Alex Jones is live on the Joe Rogan Experience.
[03:24:54.206 --> 03:24:55.147]  It's a damn brain worm.
[03:24:55.147 --> 03:24:56.729]  Well, that's probably also why they told you not to eat pork.
[03:24:56.729 --> 03:24:57.289]  And that's science fiction!
[03:24:57.289 --> 03:25:00.413]  That's a real brain worm programming you, like you were saying earlier.
[03:25:00.413 --> 03:25:01.013]  I looked, it's true.
[03:25:01.013 --> 03:25:01.834]  I didn't even know that.
[03:25:01.834 --> 03:25:05.378]  That the top soccer teams have the highest level of brain worm infestation.
[03:25:05.378 --> 03:25:13.207]  Well, there's a disproportionate amount of people that live in countries with a high toxoplasmosis infection with successful soccer teams.
[03:25:13.467 --> 03:25:20.750]  There was some study that was done on that, where we had Dr. Robert Sapolsky... Sure, well it looked like women that have it are more sexually promiscuous.
[03:25:20.750 --> 03:25:21.170]  Yes.
[03:25:21.170 --> 03:25:21.870]  It's recklessness.
[03:25:21.870 --> 03:25:29.053]  Yes, and they think that men are more reckless, and that's why there's a disproportionate amount of motorcycle victims that test positive for toxoplasmosis.
[03:25:29.053 --> 03:25:32.274]  This is what Robert Sapolsky out of Stanford University was telling us.
[03:25:32.274 --> 03:25:33.195]  Is there a way to remove...
[03:25:33.655 --> 03:25:34.856]  I don't think there is.
[03:25:34.856 --> 03:25:35.836]  I don't think there is.
[03:25:35.836 --> 03:25:40.698]  Well you know there's like snails that get a brain worm that programs to go to the top of a tree so birds eat it.
[03:25:40.698 --> 03:25:41.338]  Yeah.
[03:25:41.338 --> 03:25:44.640]  And then it's crapped out and the snails eat that and it's a food cycle.
[03:25:44.640 --> 03:25:45.400]  Yes, yes.
[03:25:45.400 --> 03:25:55.764]  So don't tell me in classic evolution, and I don't also believe interpretation by right wingers of the Bible, that's not what it says, but obviously evolution happens in big quick jumps.
[03:25:55.764 --> 03:25:56.765]  But we know what's going on.
[03:25:56.765 --> 03:26:02.087]  But the idea that just there's worms and there's all these different, well you're talking about the one that gets into a grasshopper.
[03:26:03.267 --> 03:26:08.909]  The aquatic worm gets inside of a grasshopper's body and gets the grasshopper to commit suicide.
[03:26:08.909 --> 03:26:14.391]  Gets the grasshopper to jump into water and drown and then it comes out of its body and that's where it lives.
[03:26:14.391 --> 03:26:15.391]  It lives in the water.
[03:26:15.391 --> 03:26:17.111]  So it literally gets its host to commit suicide.
[03:26:17.111 --> 03:26:24.714]  So how did that chain of events, how does that evolve where suddenly a worm gets in a grasshopper and does something a supercomputer couldn't do?
[03:26:24.714 --> 03:26:26.094]  It programs to drown itself.
[03:26:26.294 --> 03:26:28.416]  Well, this is a matter of complex biology.
[03:26:28.416 --> 03:26:31.278]  I mean, I think it's insanely complex.
[03:26:31.278 --> 03:26:34.560]  And it's something that scientists are studying on a daily basis.
[03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:37.743]  We're going to get to that coming up, because I don't want to just talk about me all day.
[03:26:39.193 --> 03:26:42.535]  I appreciate you having me on here to do it, and I know I don't have a talking point.
[03:26:42.535 --> 03:26:44.096]  I don't have a PR firm.
[03:26:44.096 --> 03:26:49.500]  You know, we even talked before we went on air about what am I going to, you know, I mean, Alex, what do you want to say today so you can help me get it out?
[03:26:49.500 --> 03:26:50.601]  I don't know.
[03:26:50.601 --> 03:26:52.102]  I want to say a bunch of things.
[03:26:52.102 --> 03:27:00.888]  I'm only learning how this works being in the process of it, and it's giving me a much bigger view than I knew 23 years ago when I first got on air, because I've experienced
[03:27:01.914 --> 03:27:04.696]  What other people have said these bad things I did experience.
[03:27:04.696 --> 03:27:06.578]  I did it from a good heart.
[03:27:06.578 --> 03:27:08.340]  I believe questioning was okay.
[03:27:08.340 --> 03:27:15.306]  I was covering other people questioning, but then there's a weird sick irony in the media that says that
[03:27:16.934 --> 03:27:29.476]  I'm the one that progenerated, Sandy Hook didn't happen when I wasn't, to then in my name popularize it to a level of like, they've put out more Sandy Hook propaganda against me, this is key, than before you invade a major country.
[03:27:29.476 --> 03:27:32.937]  I mean this has been going on for years, every day, the news, the print.
[03:27:32.937 --> 03:27:35.097]  No one died at Sandy Hook, Alex Jones says.
[03:27:35.097 --> 03:27:36.858]  Alex Jones says go to their houses and hurt them.
[03:27:36.858 --> 03:27:38.258]  What the hell is it for?
[03:27:38.258 --> 03:27:40.658]  It goes on and on and on and on.
[03:27:40.658 --> 03:27:42.939]  Well you're thinking this because it's about you.
[03:27:43.659 --> 03:27:50.182]  So, because it's about you, it becomes a primary point of focus, because it's affecting your life and it's something you're concentrating on.
[03:27:50.182 --> 03:27:51.662]  But the volume is massive!
[03:27:51.662 --> 03:27:55.364]  It is volume is massive, because it's something that generates interest.
[03:27:55.364 --> 03:27:59.606]  This is part of the problem with the way we do news today.
[03:27:59.606 --> 03:28:01.447]  Anything that generates interest.
[03:28:01.447 --> 03:28:07.049]  I mean, honestly, if the media really cared, they probably would have never talked about it.
[03:28:08.058 --> 03:28:09.479]  They probably would have never brought it up.
[03:28:09.479 --> 03:28:13.220]  We had real terror attacks in the 60s and 70s that weren't staged.
[03:28:13.220 --> 03:28:15.621]  If you go back and look at them, like the Weathermen and all that stuff.
[03:28:15.621 --> 03:28:16.561]  Yes.
[03:28:16.561 --> 03:28:18.822]  And the government and the media didn't cover it.
[03:28:18.822 --> 03:28:20.523]  Well, this is a long time ago.
[03:28:20.523 --> 03:28:24.284]  But they didn't cover it because it gives, if you cover terrorists, they do it more.
[03:28:24.284 --> 03:28:24.605]  Right.
[03:28:24.605 --> 03:28:25.105]  That's true.
[03:28:25.105 --> 03:28:25.905]  I was agreeing with you.
[03:28:25.905 --> 03:28:27.506]  Yeah, okay, that's true.
[03:28:27.506 --> 03:28:32.548]  In other countries, they don't print the name of mass shooters in the newspaper because they don't want people to get attention for that.
[03:28:33.448 --> 03:28:35.730]  I mean, some different countries have different philosophies on this.
[03:28:35.730 --> 03:28:40.114]  All I want to say is, Joe, I genuinely, I've known you 20 years, or so it's like 1998, 1999.
[03:28:40.114 --> 03:28:44.457]  I genuinely really am trying to tell the truth.
[03:28:44.457 --> 03:28:45.438]  Alright, folks.
[03:28:45.438 --> 03:28:46.719]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:46.719 --> 03:28:48.520]  Are we watching The Snake Farm?
[03:28:48.520 --> 03:28:49.581]  The Snake Farm Wrangler?
[03:28:49.581 --> 03:28:50.422]  The Worm Farm?
[03:28:50.422 --> 03:28:52.143]  It's Alex Jones on Joe Rogan.
[03:28:52.143 --> 03:28:52.604]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:53.148 --> 03:28:56.730]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:31:59.102 --> 03:32:07.689]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:32:07.689 --> 03:32:10.671]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:32:10.671 --> 03:32:12.413]  How can I solve that problem?

[03:32:38.772 --> 03:32:44.876]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:32:44.876 --> 03:32:45.717]  Don't live
[03:32:46.537 --> 03:33:00.226]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air, go to InfoWarsStore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:06.855 --> 03:33:24.139]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, so the most popular live stream on YouTube right now is by far Alex Jones on the Joe Rogan Experience.
[03:33:24.139 --> 03:33:31.501]  And pretty much anytime Joe gets a big guest on, he gets into the trending section because he's got one of the biggest live streams on YouTube.
[03:33:31.501 --> 03:33:32.401]  But magically,
[03:33:33.436 --> 03:33:44.144]  Even though there's over a hundred thousand people tuned in right now to the Joe Rogan Experience with Alex Jones in less than 25 minutes, it doesn't make it to YouTube trending.
[03:33:44.144 --> 03:33:45.365]  Oh.
[03:33:45.365 --> 03:33:47.807]  I'm sure that that's not YouTube shadowbanning.
[03:33:47.807 --> 03:33:50.068]  I'm sure that YouTube isn't doing that intentionally.
[03:33:50.068 --> 03:33:55.472]  I'm sure that's just some glitch in the algorithm that the most popular live stream on YouTube right now is not in the trending section.
[03:33:55.472 --> 03:33:57.814]  I'm sure it's... they'll fix that, I'm sure.
[03:33:57.814 --> 03:33:58.775]  So let's go back now to
[03:33:59.818 --> 03:34:01.079]  Alex Jones on the Joe Rogan Experience.
[03:34:22.808 --> 03:34:24.049]  Even though we know he's a bad guy.
[03:34:24.049 --> 03:34:26.030]  Well, why can't you hear what Alex Jones has to say?
[03:34:26.030 --> 03:34:33.835]  Because they have found what I talk about is effective, it gets people thinking, and they want it shut down because we've relaunched populism.
[03:34:33.835 --> 03:34:37.397]  Infowars has done this, my audience has.
[03:34:37.397 --> 03:34:39.358]  1776 worldwide.
[03:34:39.358 --> 03:34:43.200]  Populism, anti-globalism, anti-communism, anti-China.
[03:34:43.200 --> 03:34:44.121]  And the big tech companies.
[03:34:45.515 --> 03:34:52.738]  Google and Apple and all of them have publicly moved to China and they publicly agreed to censor and control the population.
[03:34:52.738 --> 03:34:53.978]  This is in the news.
[03:34:53.978 --> 03:34:55.459]  And that's why Tim Cook got so mad at me.
[03:34:55.459 --> 03:34:58.460]  And I made a huge issue to Trump and I sent reports to the President.
[03:34:58.460 --> 03:34:59.081]  I know he got.
[03:34:59.081 --> 03:35:03.902]  And that's what happened on that Sunday night when they said, that's it, we're done with Jones.
[03:35:03.902 --> 03:35:09.445]  We have to take him down because I got investigations going at the national security level.
[03:35:10.345 --> 03:35:32.960]  Sending big reports to the President through law firms of Reuters and AP and then the articles which he wasn't getting where China has given the code keys by Apple, this is last year, and is moving their database there and all the code keys have been given to the Chinese government and Apple says this is part of being there and Google's building Dragonfly Project to help censor the entire population with a social credit score.
[03:35:32.960 --> 03:35:34.721]  They're already testing in Venezuela with China.
[03:35:34.721 --> 03:35:38.404]  They're going to bring it here and everything you do in live time will be controlled and, you know,
[03:35:38.624 --> 03:35:41.826]  All the big airlines now are putting cameras in that watch you while you're on the airplane.
[03:35:41.826 --> 03:35:43.928]  So you think, let me stop you, because you're ranting again.
[03:35:43.928 --> 03:35:44.569]  I am ranting.
[03:35:44.569 --> 03:35:45.209]  It's okay.
[03:35:45.209 --> 03:35:57.418]  You think they're using Sandy Hook as an excuse to get you off the air and to censor you and to take away your ability to make income, not because of that, but using that as an excuse because of the other things you do.
[03:35:57.418 --> 03:36:06.105]  Like targeting things like Google and talking about things that you're talking about where they're in China and they're allowing China to censor the population.
[03:36:06.305 --> 03:36:08.651]  I'm just telling, I'm not against Google or Apple.
[03:36:08.651 --> 03:36:10.214]  They've done a lot of cool things.
[03:36:10.214 --> 03:36:11.217]  I'm saying stop it!
[03:36:12.219 --> 03:36:14.400]  Congress told you ten years ago, you were built here in the U.S.
[03:36:14.400 --> 03:36:15.140]  with DARPA money.
[03:36:15.140 --> 03:36:17.420]  Don't go help China do this stuff.
[03:36:17.420 --> 03:36:18.100]  Don't be evil.
[03:36:18.100 --> 03:36:21.221]  Well, let me tell you something, because I knew someone who worked at Google.
[03:36:21.221 --> 03:36:23.662]  I know someone who used to work at Google, I should say.
[03:36:23.662 --> 03:36:31.744]  Their thought process was that if they don't bring Google to China in a censored form, they're going to copy Google.
[03:36:31.744 --> 03:36:35.305]  This was their real worry, because China copies everything.
[03:36:35.305 --> 03:36:37.865]  I mean, intellectual copyright law over there.
[03:36:37.865 --> 03:36:39.526]  Yeah, but then they're just going to steal it better now.
[03:36:40.242 --> 03:36:40.782]  True.
[03:36:40.782 --> 03:36:42.383]  But this is what they're saying.
[03:36:42.383 --> 03:36:43.324]  Think about that, Joe.
[03:36:43.324 --> 03:36:46.666]  But let me explain something from the point of view of Google.
[03:36:46.666 --> 03:36:50.528]  As a business, and I'm not saying I agree with this, because I don't.
[03:36:50.528 --> 03:36:54.470]  Get some apple juice in your system, fella.
[03:36:54.470 --> 03:37:01.654]  They were thinking, and this is what I was talking to a woman who was a very high-level executive, and she was saying that they're going to steal it.
[03:37:01.654 --> 03:37:06.997]  If we don't work with them, they're just going to steal Google and take the code and make their own version of it.
[03:37:07.697 --> 03:37:14.800]  So them, as a business, they're like, this is inevitable, they're gonna do it anyway, we're just gonna give in to their censorship demands.
[03:37:14.800 --> 03:37:17.741]  I don't agree with it, I don't think it's a good idea, but I don't know what I would do if I was Google.
[03:37:17.741 --> 03:37:19.422]  Why did Sundar Pichai lie under oath about it?
[03:37:19.422 --> 03:37:20.302]  You'll tell what?
[03:37:20.302 --> 03:37:21.643]  I'll tell Google what they should do.
[03:37:21.643 --> 03:37:22.563]  What should they do?
[03:37:22.563 --> 03:37:23.284]  For China?
[03:37:23.284 --> 03:37:25.865]  You're dead on with what that person told you.
[03:37:25.865 --> 03:37:30.827]  When I had The Globalist, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, try to buy me off 10 million a year, you know, whatever.
[03:37:30.827 --> 03:37:33.048]  By the way, cheers.
[03:37:33.048 --> 03:37:34.188]  Here, cheers, brother.
[03:37:34.188 --> 03:37:35.849]  Anyway, when they did all that,
[03:37:38.609 --> 03:37:40.050]  Well, they did all that.
[03:37:40.050 --> 03:37:40.850]  What were they trying to do?
[03:37:40.850 --> 03:37:41.771]  Who was trying to buy you off?
[03:37:41.771 --> 03:37:42.751]  Well, I can't get into it.
[03:37:42.751 --> 03:37:46.514]  You know, they're private meetings and it's journalistic stuff off record, but everybody gets business offers.
[03:37:46.514 --> 03:37:50.476]  It's like, Alex, you're going to influence things by being on the inside.
[03:37:50.476 --> 03:37:55.399]  If you don't join this and help save the planet and do all these big things.
[03:37:55.399 --> 03:37:59.081]  My dad got the same speech when he was in high school, already at UT, he had planned to.
[03:37:59.081 --> 03:37:59.742]  I can tell you about that.
[03:37:59.742 --> 03:38:00.462]  We'll get to that later.
[03:38:02.083 --> 03:38:05.445]  If you don't join us, then the bad guys that are in the system are going to win.
[03:38:05.445 --> 03:38:10.368]  That's how they co-opt you, because that's how those people you're talking to are probably a pretty good person, that person at Google.
[03:38:10.368 --> 03:38:14.711]  They've had hundreds of their top engineers quit over this, because here's the thing.
[03:38:16.346 --> 03:38:31.271]  China, in 1949, was nationalist and capitalist, and our own CIA, it's been declassified, leftist, the Ford Foundation, that's who's above the CIA, helped put the Chi-Coms in power.
[03:38:31.271 --> 03:38:34.092]  It took them decades to get running water and toilets.
[03:38:34.092 --> 03:38:41.254]  They have no environmental standards, no rules, they've had all of our investment, they've been built up because the Chinese Commies will do whatever the globalists want.
[03:38:42.318 --> 03:38:48.882]  When you go and you are in China, they make you become state-run to get 0% tax corporate.
[03:38:48.882 --> 03:38:51.283]  Okay, that's why Trump is trying to lower ours, just to be competitive.
[03:38:51.283 --> 03:38:53.125]  China has 0% corporate tax.
[03:38:53.125 --> 03:38:54.185]  Look it up now.
[03:38:54.185 --> 03:38:57.227]  If you become state-sponsored, state-run.
[03:38:57.227 --> 03:38:58.288]  So they're claiming, oh...
[03:38:59.508 --> 03:39:08.854]  So that China doesn't rape us of our technology, we're gonna go over there and spread our legs to them even more, so it's not a rape, we're willing, and we're gonna take you along with us.
[03:39:08.854 --> 03:39:21.943]  So the idea that, well, if we don't give it to them, they're just gonna rip it off, so let us go really give them all the big secrets, and have Google last year tell the Pentagon, we're not gonna help you with AI autonomous drones.
[03:39:21.943 --> 03:39:28.107]  But Google gave them all the latest AI, and I'll get into more sophisticated stuff in a moment,
[03:39:29.232 --> 03:39:37.795]  Gave them all the sophisticated AI, and now China announces they've got all these AI drones that are autonomous, and all these AI weapon systems to direct their aircraft.
[03:39:37.795 --> 03:39:41.377]  So what I'm telling you is, China has no rules.
[03:39:41.377 --> 03:39:44.298]  20 years ago, they had cows that produced human milk.
[03:39:44.298 --> 03:39:46.799]  20 years ago, they had spiders that produced body armor.
[03:39:46.799 --> 03:39:47.779]  Spider goats.
[03:39:47.779 --> 03:39:48.259]  Okay?
[03:39:48.259 --> 03:39:50.240]  They have human-animal hybrids.
[03:39:50.240 --> 03:39:53.121]  30 years ago, they've got giant human tissue farms.
[03:39:53.641 --> 03:39:56.242]  You know, you hear, oh, your Achilles is torn.
[03:39:56.242 --> 03:39:58.783]  We've got a grown-in-a-lab, a tendon.
[03:39:58.783 --> 03:40:01.184]  It's not a frickin' tendon grown-in-a-lab.
[03:40:01.184 --> 03:40:03.925]  It's a frickin' deal humanoid.
[03:40:03.925 --> 03:40:04.685]  These aren't humans.
[03:40:04.685 --> 03:40:06.046]  The way they get around it is they make them.
[03:40:06.046 --> 03:40:07.586]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[03:40:07.586 --> 03:40:08.907]  We're saying so many things.
[03:40:08.907 --> 03:40:10.628]  This is, listen, I love you to death.
[03:40:10.628 --> 03:40:11.668]  But you say so many different things.
[03:40:11.668 --> 03:40:13.289]  I bet you $10 million humanoids are real.
[03:40:13.289 --> 03:40:13.849]  I believe they are.
[03:40:14.389 --> 03:40:17.213]  But you say so many different things without stopping.
[03:40:17.213 --> 03:40:18.314]  It's hard for people to absorb.
[03:40:18.314 --> 03:40:20.817]  Because I'm reporting to the government agency so they'll listen and investigate.
[03:40:20.817 --> 03:40:22.139]  I'm decompartmentalizing.
[03:40:22.139 --> 03:40:23.060]  This will be studied for years.
[03:40:25.486 --> 03:40:26.907]  No, what I'm telling you is... Joe!
[03:40:26.907 --> 03:40:27.127]  Joe!
[03:40:27.127 --> 03:40:27.308]  Joe!
[03:40:27.308 --> 03:40:27.488]  Joe!
[03:40:27.488 --> 03:40:27.948]  Joe!
[03:40:27.948 --> 03:40:28.969]  Yes?
[03:40:28.969 --> 03:40:35.795]  Joe, it was in MIT Quarterly 25 years ago that they had human animal embryos, but they killed them at the embryonic level.
[03:40:35.795 --> 03:40:37.036]  You can pull it up.
[03:40:37.036 --> 03:40:37.497]  I believe this.
[03:40:37.497 --> 03:40:38.758]  They've got humanoids.
[03:40:38.758 --> 03:40:39.699]  I believe this.
[03:40:39.699 --> 03:40:42.962]  Look, they've already used CRISPR to enhance children.
[03:40:42.962 --> 03:40:44.023]  With higher intelligence.
[03:40:44.023 --> 03:40:44.643]  Yes.
[03:40:44.643 --> 03:40:48.767]  It was actually, it was a side effect, they believe, of making them... It boosted their intelligence.
[03:40:48.767 --> 03:40:51.029]  It was something about HIV, immune to HIV.
[03:40:51.029 --> 03:40:51.389]  Joe!
[03:40:51.389 --> 03:40:51.529]  Joe!
[03:40:51.529 --> 03:40:51.690]  Yes?
[03:40:52.270 --> 03:40:54.313]  Everything they roll out has already been tested.
[03:40:54.313 --> 03:40:54.873]  Oh, I believe you.
[03:40:54.873 --> 03:40:55.975]  But it has an aim.
[03:40:55.975 --> 03:40:59.819]  So let me tell you what's really going on.
[03:40:59.819 --> 03:41:00.940]  The globalists want to play God.
[03:41:00.940 --> 03:41:03.844]  They have what they call a breakaway civilization.
[03:41:05.029 --> 03:41:27.249]  So instead of talking about the Breakaway Civilization, I want to talk about Sandy Hook, which I get, and I appreciate you letting me cover, and I'm sorry it ever happened, I believed it happened, I'm sorry for people's pain, and then I ask the families, and I ask the lawyers, and I ask them all, stop in my name, saying I'm the wolf at the door, saying go after these families, and stop running around through the news everywhere saying Alex Jones says Sandy Hook didn't happen, because the media is the most
[03:41:27.950 --> 03:41:28.390]  I don't
[03:41:48.619 --> 03:41:48.939]  About it.
[03:41:48.939 --> 03:41:50.861]  They're going to have a big event up there in Connecticut.
[03:41:50.861 --> 03:41:51.462]  You understand?
[03:41:51.462 --> 03:41:52.482]  And they're going to blame it on me.
[03:41:52.482 --> 03:41:54.704]  So I'm saying no, no, no.
[03:41:54.704 --> 03:41:55.985]  I believe it happened.
[03:41:55.985 --> 03:41:57.987]  Stop saying I said it didn't happen.
[03:41:57.987 --> 03:42:00.789]  And stop saying that I'm saying no kids died.
[03:42:00.789 --> 03:42:04.933]  Because I want to talk about human-animal hybrids and humanoids.
[03:42:04.933 --> 03:42:08.015]  Because, Joe, why has it got to be a humanoid?
[03:42:08.015 --> 03:42:08.956]  Why?
[03:42:08.956 --> 03:42:14.261]  Because if you make it a few percentage points another animal or another creature,
[03:42:15.774 --> 03:42:17.375]  It's a gray area, there's no human rights.
[03:42:17.375 --> 03:42:19.916]  You have an animal rights movement, you have a human rights movement.
[03:42:19.916 --> 03:42:21.276]  There's no alien movement.
[03:42:21.276 --> 03:42:23.877]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones on the Joe Rogan Experience.
[03:42:23.877 --> 03:42:26.318]  It's the number one live video on YouTube right now.
[03:42:26.318 --> 03:42:28.820]  But YouTube isn't putting it in their trending videos.
[03:42:28.820 --> 03:42:29.780]  I wonder why.
[03:42:29.780 --> 03:42:30.840]  Oh, hey.
[03:42:30.840 --> 03:42:36.743]  Do you think YouTube will ban Joe Rogan for having Alex Jones on?
[03:42:36.743 --> 03:42:39.964]  Everything else affiliated with Infowars and Alex Jones gets banned?
[03:42:39.964 --> 03:42:43.946]  Will Joe Rogan's show be banned for having Alex Jones on it live?
[03:42:45.247 --> 03:42:46.889]  Hmm.
[03:42:46.889 --> 03:42:48.131]  Hmm.
[03:42:48.131 --> 03:42:48.872]  Interesting.
[03:42:48.872 --> 03:42:49.613]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:49.613 --> 03:42:50.274]  Final segment.
[03:42:50.274 --> 03:42:51.216]  More from Alex Jones.
[03:43:02.520 --> 03:43:11.524]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:43:11.524 --> 03:43:21.609]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:43:21.609 --> 03:43:30.154]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:43:30.974 --> 03:43:32.314]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:43:32.314 --> 03:43:33.475]  You must experience it.
[03:43:33.475 --> 03:43:35.435]  It is a total game-changer.
[03:43:35.435 --> 03:43:40.476]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:43:40.476 --> 03:43:41.997]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:43:41.997 --> 03:43:43.477]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:43:43.477 --> 03:43:50.159]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it, because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:43:50.159 --> 03:43:53.420]  Turbo Force at m4slive.com.
[03:43:53.420 --> 03:43:56.520]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[03:43:56.520 --> 03:43:58.061]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[03:43:59.419 --> 03:44:02.385]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:44:02.385 --> 03:44:06.956]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply on the top.
[03:44:08.007 --> 03:44:17.130]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[03:44:17.130 --> 03:44:22.492]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[03:44:22.492 --> 03:44:24.753]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[03:44:24.753 --> 03:44:28.275]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[03:44:28.275 --> 03:44:29.755]  They've got special diet foods.
[03:44:29.755 --> 03:44:33.757]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.

[03:44:54.162 --> 03:45:02.551]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:45:02.551 --> 03:45:03.993]  Believe me, I know.
[03:45:03.993 --> 03:45:08.718]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:45:08.718 --> 03:45:11.782]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[03:45:12.262 --> 03:45:13.944]  I still have that energy.
[03:45:13.944 --> 03:45:34.100]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:45:58.863 --> 03:46:03.746]  When we have it discounted, it's about $2.50 a piece.
[03:46:03.746 --> 03:46:07.730]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece at Whole Foods.
[03:46:07.730 --> 03:46:09.131]  This is high-end.
[03:46:09.131 --> 03:46:12.393]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.
[03:46:12.393 --> 03:46:16.477]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[03:46:17.097 --> 03:46:25.983]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[03:46:25.983 --> 03:46:28.405]  It's available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:46:51.435 --> 03:46:52.515]  It's that simple.
[03:46:52.515 --> 03:46:57.197]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:46:57.197 --> 03:46:59.878]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:03.795 --> 03:47:04.896]  Alright, alright, folks.
[03:47:04.896 --> 03:47:05.937]  We're back live here.
[03:47:05.937 --> 03:47:07.339]  We're back live here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:07.339 --> 03:47:12.304]  Alex is live with Joe, and he's ranting right now against Joe, but there's a lot of cursing.
[03:47:12.304 --> 03:47:13.044]  Just fire it up, guys.
[03:47:13.044 --> 03:47:13.705]  We'll dump it if we have to.
[03:47:13.705 --> 03:47:16.808]  They've made frickin' deals with interdimensional aliens.
[03:47:16.808 --> 03:47:17.729]  Okay.
[03:47:17.729 --> 03:47:20.352]  And notice the media never attacks you for that, because that's the truth.
[03:47:20.532 --> 03:47:21.372]  Maybe this is true.
[03:47:21.372 --> 03:47:22.853]  I do not know this.
[03:47:22.853 --> 03:47:23.553]  We'll get into it.
[03:47:23.553 --> 03:47:24.694]  Okay, I do not know this.
[03:47:24.694 --> 03:47:26.994]  Even these human-pig hybrids.
[03:47:26.994 --> 03:47:27.975]  Jamie just pulled this out.
[03:47:27.975 --> 03:47:28.775]  I believe it's true.
[03:47:28.775 --> 03:47:30.956]  I'm worried about human-pig hybrids.
[03:47:30.956 --> 03:47:33.277]  I'm sorry the Sandy Hill kids died.
[03:47:33.277 --> 03:47:34.937]  My identity is not that!
[03:47:34.937 --> 03:47:35.558]  I get it.
[03:47:35.558 --> 03:47:37.698]  They admit 5G and all the studies.
[03:47:37.698 --> 03:47:39.879]  LA Times causes massive mutation and cancer.
[03:47:39.879 --> 03:47:40.700]  Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[03:47:40.700 --> 03:47:42.820]  Literally rattles your DNA apart.
[03:47:42.820 --> 03:47:44.301]  All of our kids are under attack.
[03:47:44.301 --> 03:47:44.641]  You mean 5G?
[03:47:44.641 --> 03:47:46.902]  And I'm mad at Trump for allowing 5G to come in.
[03:47:47.062 --> 03:47:48.303]  This is the new internet protocol?
[03:48:17.202 --> 03:48:17.823]  Yes.
[03:48:17.823 --> 03:48:18.583]  Yes.
[03:48:18.583 --> 03:48:20.345]  Pigs are very close to humans.
[03:48:20.345 --> 03:48:22.226]  They even use pig organs.
[03:48:22.226 --> 03:48:22.907]  Exactly.
[03:48:22.907 --> 03:48:24.008]  As usual, you know everything.
[03:48:24.008 --> 03:48:25.169]  Show!
[03:48:25.169 --> 03:48:26.109]  No, it's true.
[03:48:26.109 --> 03:48:28.672]  In a general knowledge, you know everything I know.
[03:48:28.672 --> 03:48:29.953]  No, no, no, I don't.
[03:48:29.953 --> 03:48:30.273]  Listen.
[03:48:30.273 --> 03:48:34.596]  I tell you, Joe, this is literally, we know what they're doing.
[03:48:34.596 --> 03:48:37.299]  So just like they say, just like they say,
[03:48:38.658 --> 03:48:40.480]  Oh yeah, we had human-animal hybrids.
[03:48:40.480 --> 03:48:43.722]  This is like frickin' 39 years ago now.
[03:48:43.722 --> 03:48:47.125]  23 years ago, I'm reading in the BBC about it, and go confirm it's happening.
[03:48:47.125 --> 03:48:47.565]  Okay?
[03:48:47.565 --> 03:48:48.666]  And they're just floating it.
[03:48:48.666 --> 03:48:50.068]  There was an article in 1999 in the Baltimore Sun.
[03:48:52.256 --> 03:48:52.996]  And I interviewed Nick Begich.
[03:48:52.996 --> 03:48:54.277]  You ever heard of Nick Begich, Dr. Nick Begich?
[03:48:54.277 --> 03:48:54.477]  No.
[03:48:54.477 --> 03:48:55.458]  Oh my God, he'd blow you away.
[03:48:55.458 --> 03:48:55.798]  Who is he?
[03:48:55.798 --> 03:48:56.978]  His dad was a U.S.
[03:48:56.978 --> 03:48:57.839]  congressman that got killed.
[03:48:57.839 --> 03:48:58.419]  His brother, a U.S.
[03:48:58.419 --> 03:48:59.360]  senator.
[03:48:59.360 --> 03:49:00.720]  He's, he like, he's... Should I have him on the show?
[03:49:00.720 --> 03:49:02.741]  They're the guys that got all the money given to Native Americans.
[03:49:02.741 --> 03:49:04.062]  Can you spell his last name?
[03:49:04.062 --> 03:49:04.462]  Begich.
[03:49:04.462 --> 03:49:06.623]  It's, it's, it's, uh, he's a good friend of mine.
[03:49:06.623 --> 03:49:07.364]  Can I get him on?
[03:49:07.364 --> 03:49:07.884]  Absolutely.
[03:49:07.884 --> 03:49:08.885]  We'll fly her right now.
[03:49:08.885 --> 03:49:11.146]  Anyways, the point is... So what does he do?
[03:49:11.146 --> 03:49:15.888]  He was telling me all these years ago, he goes, Alex, it isn't chemicals in the food and water.
[03:49:15.888 --> 03:49:16.569]  That's child's play.
[03:49:16.569 --> 03:49:17.389]  Spell his last name again?
[03:49:17.610 --> 03:49:19.034]  Bag of Chats.
[03:49:19.034 --> 03:49:19.917]  I can only write it.
[03:49:19.917 --> 03:49:20.439]  Jim?
[03:49:20.439 --> 03:49:21.522]  It's electrochemical.
[03:49:21.522 --> 03:49:21.884]  Okay.
[03:49:21.884 --> 03:49:22.586]  It's electrochemical.
[03:49:24.614 --> 03:49:44.800]  But I'm reading in the Baltimore Sun, after I just had him on, I thought it was crazy, he's giving me all these patents for mind control using wavelengths and microwaves, and I'm sitting there looking at it, and I'm reading it, and I'm seeing it, and the Baltimore Sun says, the CIA is testing on cell towers wavelengths to calm the public during crises.
[03:49:44.800 --> 03:49:47.781]  I just had Begich on with patents talking about that.
[03:49:47.781 --> 03:49:50.982]  What Begich explains is, it's not that the microwaves
[03:49:51.542 --> 03:49:53.684]  have somehow interfaced with the brain.
[03:49:53.684 --> 03:49:58.547]  We already interfaced with the space winds and all these other magnetic fields, everything else.
[03:49:58.547 --> 03:50:00.768]  So they're all just testing this stuff.
[03:50:00.768 --> 03:50:03.430]  And so everything they deploy, they've got all these other technologies.
[03:50:03.430 --> 03:50:05.952]  My dad was at UT in 65 when he was in high school.
[03:50:05.952 --> 03:50:08.694]  They already had CD-ROMs, computers, everything.
[03:50:08.694 --> 03:50:11.816]  But they had a nuclear reactor underneath the building and he wasn't supposed to tell them.
[03:50:11.816 --> 03:50:12.496]  What?
[03:50:12.496 --> 03:50:13.577]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:50:13.577 --> 03:50:14.237]  That's what I'm telling you.
[03:50:14.237 --> 03:50:15.778]  It's a breakaway civilization, dude.
[03:50:15.778 --> 03:50:17.419]  We don't know what they've got.
[03:50:17.419 --> 03:50:17.960]  We don't know.
[03:50:17.960 --> 03:50:18.720]  We don't know who they are.
[03:50:18.720 --> 03:50:19.381]  We don't know the whole thing.
[03:50:19.881 --> 03:50:22.464]  That's what I'm telling you is this is hiding in plain view.
[03:50:22.464 --> 03:50:23.425]  And that's why it's so crazy.
[03:50:23.425 --> 03:50:27.609]  Imagine if you knew all this, you're trying to tell people and they go, Oh God, he's doing that.
[03:50:27.609 --> 03:50:30.772]  Find one thing he did that sounds mean and make that his whole world.
[03:50:30.772 --> 03:50:36.958]  So that's what I'm telling you is it's been in the newspaper that the cell towers are being used for mind control.
[03:50:36.958 --> 03:50:38.400]  That sounds like a schizophrenic.
[03:50:38.740 --> 03:50:39.941]  So see, here's what a schizophrenic is.
[03:50:39.941 --> 03:50:40.781]  I want to see that.
[03:50:40.781 --> 03:50:42.743]  How do they use the cell towers for that?
[03:50:42.743 --> 03:50:43.263]  Here's the thing.
[03:50:43.263 --> 03:50:45.144]  Listen, here's the deal.
[03:50:45.144 --> 03:50:45.865]  Right here.
[03:50:45.865 --> 03:50:52.449]  You've got a total schizophrenic that thinks the sun is following them around town and thinks their dog is watching them and works for the aliens.
[03:50:52.449 --> 03:50:53.170]  That's not happening.
[03:50:53.996 --> 03:50:58.901]  You've got someone over here, someone over here that believes everything they see on Fox News.
[03:50:58.901 --> 03:50:59.442]  Yes.
[03:50:59.442 --> 03:50:59.982]  Okay?
[03:50:59.982 --> 03:51:00.363]  Yes.
[03:51:00.363 --> 03:51:01.684]  Now, questioning's good.
[03:51:01.684 --> 03:51:03.586]  Science is good trying to figure out what's real.
[03:51:03.586 --> 03:51:03.927]  Yes.
[03:51:03.927 --> 03:51:05.929]  And all of us get freaked out, the nature of the world.
[03:51:05.929 --> 03:51:07.370]  No one knows what the universe is.
[03:51:07.370 --> 03:51:08.531]  We don't have all the answers.
[03:51:08.531 --> 03:51:11.434]  So it kind of, people can't handle that bigness.
[03:51:11.434 --> 03:51:14.017]  They can't handle that question, especially low IQ.
[03:51:15.129 --> 03:51:25.695]  So, they have to differentiate and create a model that allows them to put it in boxes so they can make it... This is our crew showing the articles about what Alex is talking about, by the way, not Rogan's crew.
[03:51:25.695 --> 03:51:31.839]  ...spacewalk for the first time, and they're out in the universe, and the whole planet's under them, and what are they going to do?
[03:51:31.839 --> 03:51:32.479]  It's mind-blowing.
[03:51:32.679 --> 03:51:38.724]  Well, imagine once you realize we don't know everything, we don't understand, and it's endless, and there's all this crazy crap.
[03:51:38.724 --> 03:51:48.852]  People go nuts, and as humans learn more and more, as we become more advanced and go through this metamorphosis, it's going to create a giant societal crisis where most of the people are already going to get killed.
[03:51:48.852 --> 03:51:50.274]  The globalists understand that.
[03:51:50.874 --> 03:51:53.297]  In the birth of this planet, this new species.
[03:51:53.297 --> 03:52:00.948]  And so they've decided to take control, make it scientific, stun everyone and dumb them down so they can scientifically try to orderly carry this operation out.
[03:52:00.948 --> 03:52:07.217]  But then I go, wait a minute, you're detonating over 100 hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere to see if you can ignite the atmosphere and destroy the Earth.
[03:52:07.637 --> 03:52:09.378]  Yeah, but that was in the 60s.
[03:52:09.378 --> 03:52:13.161]  I know, but what I'm telling you is, the same professors trained people.
[03:52:13.161 --> 03:52:14.382]  Right, but those people are dead.
[03:52:14.382 --> 03:52:18.866]  The people that detonated those hydrogen bombs in the 60s, they're dead now.
[03:52:18.866 --> 03:52:20.867]  We're not dealing with the same human beings.
[03:52:20.867 --> 03:52:23.970]  I'm with you on most... I think people in a lot of ways are more immoral now.
[03:52:23.970 --> 03:52:28.513]  I think, I agree with you in some ways that everything evolves and things get better.
[03:52:28.513 --> 03:52:35.178]  This is one of my arguments about Operation Northwoods, that if they were able to push Operation Northwoods and get it signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962, was it 62?
[03:52:37.840 --> 03:52:48.403]  If they were able to do that, and no one went to jail, and no one got arrested for proposing that they were going to arm Cuban friendlies and have them bomb Guantanamo Bay and blow up a Cuban jetliner.
[03:52:48.403 --> 03:52:50.163]  And shoot people in movie theaters.
[03:52:50.163 --> 03:52:50.623]  Yes.
[03:52:50.623 --> 03:52:51.203]  And schools.
[03:52:51.203 --> 03:52:51.703]  Yes.
[03:52:51.703 --> 03:52:53.584]  That things evolve.
[03:52:53.584 --> 03:52:54.664]  Things evolve.
[03:52:54.664 --> 03:52:58.685]  And if unchecked, and obviously that was unchecked, no one went to jail for that.
[03:52:58.685 --> 03:53:01.386]  Did you know even PBS covered it?
[03:53:01.386 --> 03:53:02.286]  Like, I never even knew this.
[03:53:02.546 --> 03:53:04.048]  Here, let's read this one here.
[03:53:04.048 --> 03:53:16.120]  The significance of the research he explained is that although the cell phone power is low, electromagnetic radiation can nevertheless have an effect on mental behavior when transmitting at the proper frequency.
[03:53:16.120 --> 03:53:17.341]  What is this article, Jamie?
[03:53:17.341 --> 03:53:17.962]  Scientific American.
[03:53:18.462 --> 03:53:21.804]  In Scientific American, it's titled, Mind Control by Cell Phone.
[03:53:21.804 --> 03:53:23.325]  So it really does have an effect.
[03:53:23.325 --> 03:53:24.546]  They did a whole study on that.
[03:53:24.546 --> 03:53:26.227]  But let's go further.
[03:53:26.227 --> 03:53:27.228]  It doesn't.
[03:53:27.228 --> 03:53:29.949]  So would you think that they're making this 5G protocol?
[03:53:29.949 --> 03:53:40.656]  No, they declassified last year a 37-page CIA manual from the 1970s where they were putting up cell towers that looked like trees, already testing at neighborhoods.
[03:53:40.996 --> 03:53:47.780]  Okay, so the cell phone tracks you, and watches you, and controls you, and surveils you.
[03:53:47.780 --> 03:53:52.143]  You think that it's one way.
[03:53:52.143 --> 03:53:56.806]  But beyond that, it's a microwave relay system that can manipulate.
[03:53:56.806 --> 03:53:58.607]  And then the towers are even more powerful.
[03:53:58.607 --> 03:54:02.629]  So this is a device given to us by the gods.
[03:54:02.629 --> 03:54:08.293]  Okay, given to us by the technology that the breakaway government, NASA,
[03:54:09.053 --> 03:54:13.038]  The media has developed that you don't just think they made up themselves, right?
[03:54:13.038 --> 03:54:13.538]  What do you mean?
[03:54:13.538 --> 03:54:15.160]  Who do you think made it up?
[03:54:15.160 --> 03:54:17.783]  Well, when you're ready to get to it, I want listeners to understand something.
[03:54:17.783 --> 03:54:20.326]  Notice the media is not going to cover this.
[03:54:20.326 --> 03:54:21.247]  The media is not?
[03:54:21.247 --> 03:54:22.309]  Well, they'll cover what was on the show.
[03:54:22.309 --> 03:54:24.591]  They're not going to cover this.
[03:54:24.591 --> 03:54:26.293]  Because this is not my opinion.
[03:54:26.293 --> 03:54:27.895]  This is the real research.
[03:54:28.905 --> 03:54:53.535]  That I have heard, that I have talked to Army Generals, Commanding Generals, Major Generals, General Generals, CIA, everybody, and they're all 100%, and I thought it was a side out before, and I've researched it, I've talked to hundreds of people now, not on air, but I'm going to make a film on this, who've taken ayahuasca and DMT, I've not taken it, for obvious reasons.
[03:54:57.563 --> 03:55:16.843]  And it's unbelievable because I mean they 100% in San Francisco is the main project site literally have an alien base and they are literally communicating and they've got like astronaut level people taking super hardcore levels of drugs and going into meetings with these things and making intergalactic deals.
[03:55:16.843 --> 03:55:19.826]  And again, that's what the government believes and says they're doing.
[03:55:20.766 --> 03:55:23.267]  When you say the government, that's a broad stroke.
[03:55:23.267 --> 03:55:25.609]  You're painting, you're using a broad brush.
[03:55:25.609 --> 03:55:26.649]  What do you mean by the government?
[03:55:26.649 --> 03:55:29.350]  Break away rogue intelligence agencies.
[03:55:29.350 --> 03:55:34.773]  Okay, so what you're saying is essentially that they're using psychedelic drugs to communicate with interdimensional beings.
[03:55:35.373 --> 03:55:36.173]  All right.
[03:55:36.173 --> 03:55:36.854]  Spirit guides.
[03:55:36.854 --> 03:55:37.514]  Okay.
[03:55:37.514 --> 03:55:43.677]  Everyone, everyone who's done a high dose of psychedelic drugs has had this experience.
[03:55:43.677 --> 03:55:50.259]  So everyone is listening to you right now who's done DMT or done five grams of psilocybin.
[03:55:50.259 --> 03:55:55.341]  They know that this is a, you have some kind of communication with something else.
[03:55:55.341 --> 03:56:00.003]  The question is, is that something else inside your psyche or is that something else?
[03:56:00.003 --> 03:56:01.044]  A chemical door?
[03:56:01.624 --> 03:56:17.627]  Is there a chemical doorway inside the mind that opens up, and the belief is that when you die, and this is what the afterlife is, that when you die, your brain produces these chemicals, these chemicals open up this doorway, and this is the portal to the next dimension.
[03:56:18.428 --> 03:56:23.111]  So you're saying, you're saying that the government is aware of this and they must be aware of this.
[03:56:23.111 --> 03:56:25.913]  They've heard enough people talk about it, they must have done experiments on it.
[03:56:25.913 --> 03:56:27.153]  What do scientists do?
[03:56:27.153 --> 03:56:28.474]  They want to know the secrets of the universe.
[03:56:28.474 --> 03:56:28.874]  For sure.
[03:56:28.874 --> 03:56:46.465]  And people that have the courage to experiment with these things and try them themselves realize that this is such a profound experience that it is, it's so alien that if an alien landed right now in our parking lot and a little gray man with big black eyes got out, it would be nothing compared to what I've seen.
[03:56:47.265 --> 03:56:48.146]  On Psychedelic Drugs.
[03:57:04.121 --> 03:57:08.302]  I have low oxygen, and I have... Nine volt brains?
[03:57:08.302 --> 03:57:13.304]  Well, who have sleep apnea, big necks, big heads, tonsils.
[03:57:13.304 --> 03:57:14.365]  Like you and me.
[03:57:14.365 --> 03:57:19.946]  You go down to 62% oxygen, that's another time that the brain releases DMT.
[03:57:19.946 --> 03:57:26.729]  So my whole life, since I was about, my first memories were every night was a DMT trip.
[03:57:27.566 --> 03:57:28.807]  So, I basically...
