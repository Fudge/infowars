[00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:25.701]  On Holy Saturday, April 4, 2015, while the good people of the city of North Charleston, South Carolina reflected on the meaning of the day before Easter, 50-year-old Walter Scott, a veteran of the Coast Guard and father of four, was running for his life due to a broken taillight and child support back pay.
[00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:32.697]  This was a cop who felt like he could get away with just shooting someone that many times in the back.
[00:00:32.977 --> 00:00:36.360]  He just casually shot a man in the back that many times.
[00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:44.068]  And it speaks to the value of human life, which is a bigger issue than trying to just make this a small issue of race.
[00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.473]  This is a bigger issue of human life and the value of it.
[00:00:49.013 --> 00:00:52.359]  And when people start respecting that more, it won't matter what color you are.
[00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.148]  Once again, if we would have just took the initial newspaper reports, it would have been, why'd that guy grab the taser?
[00:00:58.168 --> 00:01:00.011]  He shouldn't have tried to hurt the cop.
[00:01:00.472 --> 00:01:01.794]  But that wasn't what happened.
[00:01:02.543 --> 00:01:03.324]  And the truth came out.
[00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:24.777]  Lisa Markle has been suspended without pay.
[00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:28.480]  State police investigated David Kasich's death for seven weeks.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.526]  Criminal charges will not be filed against 300 Seville police officers involved in the shooting of a burglary suspect back in March.
[00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:38.708]  The officer is suspended without pay.
[00:01:38.728 --> 00:01:47.575]  33-year-old officer Michael T. Slager immediately claimed he feared for his life in a 9-11 call because Mr. Scott had taken the stun gun from him in a scuffle.
[00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:49.277]  223 just got shot and fired.
[00:01:49.857 --> 00:01:50.518]  Subject is down.
[00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:52.406]  He grabbed my chaser.
[00:01:54.687 --> 00:01:55.948]  Miss, I've got a 223 shot.
[00:01:56.328 --> 00:01:57.929]  I already grabbed your chaser.
[00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:10.658]  The video clearly tells a completely different story as Officer Slager plants the stun gun next to Scott's face down and limp handcuffed body in full view of another officer who needs to be investigated as well.
[00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:30.385]  Before the vampiric White House media machine fueled by billionaire George Soros can drag this out into the arena of public opinion and shake its collectivist despotic finger at racism as the culprit, the facts show that a trigger-happy cop is 25 times more likely to shoot a white citizen than a black citizen.
[00:02:30.805 --> 00:02:37.407]  President Obama with great communistic zeal has done more to militarize the police than any previous president.
[00:02:37.627 --> 00:02:41.988]  The President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing rolled out in March of 2015.
[00:02:42.608 --> 00:02:52.971]  The multi-million dollar action plan appears to address an effort to build legitimacy and trust with a transparent approach towards policing, using technology and treating citizens with respect.
[00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:53.571]  However,
[00:02:53.931 --> 00:03:02.874]  Looking deeper into it, the 109-page plan is nothing less than a common core for police, a globalist federalization of state and local police force standards.
[00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:08.977]  In the document, Task Force member Susan Rahr points out the stark differences between police and military.
[00:03:09.097 --> 00:03:14.239]  In 2012, we began asking the question, why are we training police officers like soldiers?
[00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:19.381]  Although police officers wear uniforms and carry weapons, the similarity ends there.
[00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.422]  The missions and rules of engagement are completely different.
[00:03:22.782 --> 00:03:26.103]  The soldier's mission is that of a warrior, to conquer.
[00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:29.463]  The rules of engagement are decided before the battle.
[00:03:29.984 --> 00:03:33.804]  The police officer's mission is that of a guardian, to protect.
[00:03:34.064 --> 00:03:36.845]  The rules of engagement evolve as the incident unfolds.
[00:03:37.145 --> 00:03:38.565]  Soldiers must follow orders.
[00:03:38.845 --> 00:03:41.646]  Police officers must make independent decisions.
[00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:45.707]  Soldiers come into communities as an outside occupying force.
[00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:50.268]  Guardians are members of the community, protecting from within.
[00:03:50.888 --> 00:04:03.697]  But in full doublespeak, the DOJ's unconstitutional $123 million Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, program is testing out federal militarization of police forces in six cities.
[00:04:03.817 --> 00:04:09.241]  The COPS website is focused in on Homeland Security to include protecting critical infrastructure
[00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:14.463]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:04:28.348 --> 00:04:40.578]  Additional consideration was also given for the applicants who have experienced an unanticipated catastrophic event, and the COPS Office supports the Attorney General's commitment to hiring military veterans whenever possible.
[00:04:40.798 --> 00:04:50.927]  The law worked because the surveillance state works both ways, and after reviewing the video, unlike the outcome of the blatant death of Eric Garner in Long Island, New York,
[00:04:51.227 --> 00:04:57.871]  What we have here is, as you've already noted, an illegal chokehold caught on tape.
[00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:00.312]  The coroner says that this is a homicide.
[00:05:00.812 --> 00:05:01.513]  End of story.
[00:05:01.793 --> 00:05:10.718]  There is no way in my mind or anybody else's mind, I believe, that's looking at this for what it is, that we can justify a no indictment from this grand jury.
[00:05:11.078 --> 00:05:14.319]  The scales of law and order were honored rather than ignored.
[00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:20.700]  And it didn't take a multi-million dollar routing of liberty like the DOJ's COPS program to make it all happen.
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.041]  It's real simple.
[00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:24.901]  The system works when it's not being violated.
[00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:28.602]  It goes to say how we work as a community.
[00:05:29.222 --> 00:05:31.543]  When you're wrong, you're wrong.
[00:05:32.963 --> 00:05:39.565]  And if you make a bad decision, don't care if you're behind the shield or just a citizen on the street.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.621]  You have to live by that decision.
[00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:44.522]  I'm not defending police.
[00:05:45.122 --> 00:05:46.863]  In fact, I'm trying to reform the police.
[00:05:47.283 --> 00:05:52.606]  And you don't do that by running around saying, kill the police, like the George Soros funded groups.
[00:05:53.166 --> 00:06:04.311]  You're going to reform the police by explaining to them, most of them already know this, the globalist paradigm of giving them the training, the culture, that will make them enemies of the people, giving them missions that will make them enemies, the fake drug war,
[00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:12.835]  Going after folks for petty crimes like long grass in their yard, but letting, you know, big bankers go free and illegal aliens go free, they don't like it either on average.
[00:06:13.096 --> 00:06:20.620]  But then the bad cops get protected by the corruption, and then that comes out in the media, demonizing the police in general.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.961]  The point is, is that the world's not perfect!
[00:06:25.162 --> 00:06:30.225]  You're gonna have shootings, you're gonna have crazy pilots crashing planes, you're going to have bad cops!
[00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.537]  And no amount of reform from the top's going to fix it, because the globals don't want to fix anything.
[00:06:37.678 --> 00:06:38.559]  That's what I'm getting at here.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.662]  John Bowne for Infowars.com
[00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:58.292]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:06:58.592 --> 00:07:00.874]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:07:01.174 --> 00:07:10.881]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:07:11.201 --> 00:07:19.428]  That's why we're rolling out on a 100% Made in America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:07:19.628 --> 00:07:22.170]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:07:22.591 --> 00:07:26.834]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:28.095]  We are the spirit of 1776.
[00:07:29.596 --> 00:07:31.878]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:07:31.938 --> 00:07:37.163]  We are all brothers and sisters in arms in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:07:37.383 --> 00:07:37.883]  We're good to go.
