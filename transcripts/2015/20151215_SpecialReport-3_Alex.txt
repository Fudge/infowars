[00:00:02.754 --> 00:00:08.618]  Obama boldly stated that the federal government has the Syrian refugee crisis under control.
[00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:13.862]  We've hardened our defenses from airports to financial centers to other critical infrastructure.
[00:00:15.142 --> 00:00:22.928]  Intelligence and law enforcement agencies have disrupted countless plots here and overseas and worked around the clock to keep us safe.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:34.843]  Our military and counter-terrorism professionals have relentlessly pursued terrorist networks overseas, disrupting safe havens in several different countries, killing Osama bin Laden.
[00:00:35.063 --> 00:00:51.147]  But Obama didn't happen to mention that Representative Stephen Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, disclosed that a congressional investigation recently found that at least 72 people working at the Department of Homeland Security also were on the terror watch list.
[00:00:51.407 --> 00:00:52.968]  What would have been a scandal 30 years ago
[00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:12.220]  Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.
[00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:21.727]  The liberal reactionaries on Twitter replied with fervor, even going so far as to call for Trump's assassination.
[00:01:21.907 --> 00:01:24.229]  Tweets included, Can we kill Trump?
[00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:27.471]  Now he wants to impede Muslims from entering the US.
[00:01:27.812 --> 00:01:30.033]  Someone really needs to kill Trump.
[00:01:30.253 --> 00:01:31.194]  ASAP.
[00:01:31.534 --> 00:01:32.795]  Somebody kill Trump.
[00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:34.456]  I genuinely mean it.
[00:01:34.797 --> 00:01:40.861]  And I'd rather murder Trump and rot in jail than let my kid grow up in a world with Trump as president.
[00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:52.404]  Fresh off of backtracking her statements disregarding the First Amendment, it appears Attorney General Loretta Lynch would find all of this call to violent action, at the very least, predicating.
[00:01:52.624 --> 00:01:57.025]  Of course, she won't bat an eye, because Trump is on the wrong team.
[00:01:57.325 --> 00:02:01.366]  The lamestream media began to weigh in with their bought-and-paid-for tactics.
[00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:07.270]  You have leaders from your own party in the key states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina.
[00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.375]  You have galvanized political rivals, all saying this is un-American and extreme, and that it makes you a fascist.
[00:02:14.795 --> 00:02:15.556]  How do you respond?
[00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:17.937]  Well, I totally disagree.
[00:02:18.598 --> 00:02:19.038]  Take a look.
[00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.741]  You take a look, Chris, at what's going on, and it is disgraceful.
[00:02:24.302 --> 00:02:30.126]  First of all, you know, people quickly forget World Trade Center One, World Trade Center Number Two,
[00:02:30.888 --> 00:02:36.774]  Not to be outdone, the flustered Republican field was all aglow with slap-in-the-face collective mentality.
[00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:41.900]  Politico writes, Jeb Bush fired back on Twitter saying Donald Trump is unhinged.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.063]  His policy proposals are not serious.
[00:02:45.503 --> 00:02:52.491]  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said, this is the kind of thing that people say when they have no experience and don't know what they're talking about.
[00:02:52.791 --> 00:03:07.394]  The billionaire GOP frontrunner, Trump, argued that what I'm doing is no different than FDR, likening his proposal to policies implemented by Roosevelt against people of Japanese, German, and Italian descent during World War II.
[00:03:07.674 --> 00:03:08.595]  And that's just it.
[00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:14.976]  You can't cover up an invasion of 72% male Syrian refugees into foreign lands.
[00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:22.938]  Where women are being raped at epidemic levels and jihad attacks are brandishing a foothold in regularity in Western culture.
[00:03:23.238 --> 00:03:25.479]  Wake up and smell the reality.
[00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.981]  We are under attack, courtesy of our do-nothing, say-nothing, commandeer-in-chief.
[00:03:32.301 --> 00:03:42.184]  How many suicide bombings on American soil are the leftist, lamestream media bobbleheads prepared to spin before Americans have to bail them out of hell on earth?
[00:03:42.544 --> 00:03:47.131]  Fomented by their own PC rhetoric and Global Masters talking points.
[00:03:47.472 --> 00:03:49.415]  John Bound for InfoWars.com
[00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:07.773]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential forklift situation?
[00:04:07.793 --> 00:04:11.156]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd.
[00:04:11.236 --> 00:04:12.818]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assaulted!
[00:04:12.838 --> 00:04:19.144]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[00:04:19.244 --> 00:04:25.130]  Is this another false flag stage attack to take our civil liberties and put more homeless in security by sticking our hands down on the streets?
[00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.054]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:32.197]  And that's what PrisonPlanet.TV is designed to do.
[00:04:32.317 --> 00:04:40.325]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:42.647]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[00:04:42.707 --> 00:04:43.748]  It's a war against the truth.
[00:04:44.088 --> 00:04:52.858]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of PrisonPlanet.tv and share their membership with up to 11 friends and family.
